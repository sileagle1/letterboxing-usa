                        Hello Celticrelics:

We had fun finding this letterbox on our way to the
airport.  What a great stamp!  I tried sending this to your email 
address, but it was returned as fail mai.  See the note...

I took a walk through Peace Valley Park this morning and I was also 
unable to find the The Might Oak box.  I found this box back in 
March of 2002, so I was in the right place.  Last...

                        When I placed my first letterbox I also released a hitchhiker.  It

box in my PFX number?

Your box is in great condition and was so much fun to find,
however, Since you planted it in April you may not have seen the 
poison ivy.  I saw most of it or thought I did until I stood up and...

                        Happy Mother's Day.  Bless you all.
We took my mom out for dinner today.
She gave birth to and raised 7 children
(all as difficult as me believe it or
not) and she's still smiling!

Take care...
