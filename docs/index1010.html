                        Uncle Walter's is great stuff to carve images into--and it's so thick you

                        Several people have expressed interest in submitting photos of kids hunting
for and/or placing letterboxes.  Such pictures would be great additions to
the Kids Corner feature of Letterbox USA.

                        FYI: I finally got the images of the "April Fools" Kayaker stamp and the
Mt. Tammany stamp online.  If you're interested, you can find them from my
