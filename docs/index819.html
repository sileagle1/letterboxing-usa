Though these boxes were originally planted on 3/30/02,  Bob 
and I replanted Pick o' Nick on 4/27/02 as I was unhappy with its original 
location.  That's why these clues are so late in...

                        Another new box has just been placed today in Paint Branch Park 
(Montgomery County). It is a nice walk to the box and there is one 
stream crossing.  You can probably hop the stones though. Enjoy! ...
