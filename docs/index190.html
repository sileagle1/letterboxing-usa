Hello!

We have a series planted in VA right now featuring the faces of the 
five main scooby doo characters.  We'd like to get a whole bunch 
more stamps of other scooby related things - monsters,...

The movie is called National Treasure. If you go to the website and 
click on treasure hunt activities, letterboxing is right...

Thanks for the safe return of our GGG event stamp. Glad it was put to 
good use. And what a nice gesture for you to enclose a hitchhiker and 
a nice piece of Mastercarve! Very thoughtful.

Good...

Lately I have noticed many of the HH  I find have not
been stamped into the logbook of the box they currently
reside in, and sometimes the stamp of the hostel has
not even been put into the logbook...
