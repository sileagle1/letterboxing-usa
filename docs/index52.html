                        Exactly. WOM is also restrictive but I don't see anyone complaining about those.
Maybe someone can explain why they think WOM restrictions are OK but f-count restrictions are not.

I hate to see us over react and make more of this than it is. It's really  
okay to discuss responsible...

                        I'm looking for any letterboxes that may be planted on St. Martin.  I 
tried searching online but could not find any.  If anyone knows of any 
boxes planted there, please let me know

Thanks

                        Okay, there is a rumor going around among some non-letterboxers that 
some cryptic messages that were posted "out in the open" must be clues 
to the Letterboxing Essentials box in Gambrill Park......
