                        Hello, carvers!

On September 17 and 18 we will be hosting a gathering, Boxtemberfest, 
in western Colorado!  We are hoping that some of you will be inspired 
to create a box and send it here to play...

                        FYI, box #2 from the As You Wish series in East
Haddam, Ct. has been replaced in a brand new location.
 Excuse my bitterness, but a pox upon whoever stole it
in the first place.

                        Does anyone know if these boxes have been replaced?
The clues say that a few are still there but we attempted to find them 
and couldn't. We're positive we were in the right spot. Just no boxes

                        I always hike with Molly who happens to be a dog. Many
times its just her and myself. I dont think the
