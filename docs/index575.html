Please remove the clues for "The Eagle has Landed" LB
(as it's MIA) in Eagle and add the 
clues for "Fish Lips" LB to the Idaho clues page. 
Thanks so much.

Please post these clues to the ID Clues Page.  The
original letterbox for this was missing so I redid the
stamp and hid it in a new location.  
Thank so much.
