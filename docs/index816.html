                        Today, between the downpours and happy birds, we had success in 
locating the letterbox at Vernonia Lake.

Nice stamp by the way!!  Thanks for the adventure.

                            Unfortunately, I have to report a second box missing at York

It was in the central area for park activity. I'm surprised it...

                        Has anyone found this letter box recently?
4 people searched for 2.5 hours on 5/4 and wonder if
the box has been reported missing?
Thanks, E
