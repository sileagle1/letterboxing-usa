Mohmer's, thanks for adding the extra fun of letterboxes to a trip to 
the ST Louis zoo.  We had a good time on Sat 9/1/01 at the zoo.  We 
only found 2 out of the five boxes.  Being new at this...

Looking for recommendation of a letterbox in CT or MA to
break up a long drive.  These criteria would be ideal --
