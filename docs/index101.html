                        Hi everyone,

Eoghan's O-Knots box in Bastrop, TX.  Now, none of Eoghan's links are

                        You were the first finder of my Shoe FLY Pie box. You stamped in but 
didn't sign your trail name or date. I'd love to know who it was and 
when you were there!

                        The LbNA patches are available without a bulk order.  The bulk order note has 
been removed from the LbNA regalia page but somehow keeps popping back up.

I'm sure it has something to do with the way...
