&gt;I've been noticing an increase in typos on the clues I've been <br/>
downloading on the website, and hate to sound like a schoolmarm or to <br/>
be critical in any way, but wish that maybe the webmasters could take <br/>
a moment to run them through a spellchecker before posting?<br/>

Hi, Boxinva!<br/>
Th; usualt reason we don't automatically fix an authors typos is that <br/>
we firmly believe letterboxers own the copyright to their clues. If <br/>
we were to start spott spell checking for errors we could <br/>
inadvertently do damag|e too thc clues. (What if someone put typos in <br/>
on purpose?). Another reason on the topp ov the list why thx <br/>
webmasters don't edit clues is the bbig scrambl it would take to <br/>
loock fo errors. We'd have to get thi whitte out markr going, and I <br/>
for one am not to be trusted with office supplies because I make a <br/>
big mess. Still, I know what you mean! This is also the reason we try <br/>
not to mark boxes as "missing" unless the planter authorizes it. You <br/>
wouldn't believe how often a box is mistakenly reported "missing" <br/>
when it was actually just "not found." If you have any questions <br/>
about this whole thing, please don't hesitate to ask.<br/>

letterbox clues sent to her first for spell check before sending on <br/>
to the webmasters who I'm sure don't have the extra time to check for <br/>
typos.<br/>
