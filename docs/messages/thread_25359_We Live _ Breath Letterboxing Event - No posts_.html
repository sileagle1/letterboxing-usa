                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, I finally got back to the Republic of Texas today from the event and expected to see many posts to talk list about event........nothing.  Was also shocked at how many people did not even know about this talk list that were at event (many of which did not know any of the Founders names either).   Shocking.   As for me, had a great time meeting these founders and getting to know them.   Best part of event was sitting around the dinning hall talking and sharing stories.  <br/>
<br/>
After event Silver Eagle and I traveled up to Vermont and found the oldest box (Prayer Rock), and the oldest surviving original box still in place as planted, all in 1 day!!!!    Sad thing was no one had been to either box in years.   <br/>

Thanks to all that put on event, and all that attended!   Great fun and great people!!!!<br/>

Cave Point, Mink River, and Cana Island were all intact the last time I was able to check any of those locations.  Most of the rest of the Lighthouse series were casualties of weather, wear, and critters (furry as well as human.)  Back in those days, the message board (or one of the original ones, I think it's moved twice since then) was often contentious with people arguing the fundamentals of what letterboxing should be and how it should be run.  Some things never change, do they?  Some of the early founders left the hobby because of the issues, but I guess many of them are still on the boards.  Maybe now that there are more boxes around, it might be the time to get back into things.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>Steven</span><o:p></o:p></p><p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p><p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p><p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p><div><div><p><b><span>From:</span></b><span> letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com [mailto:letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com] <b>On Behalf Of </b>sileagle@windstream.net<br/><b>Sent:</b> Thursday, September 05, 2013 7:23 PM<br/><b>To:</b> letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com<br/><b>Subject:</b> RE: Re: [LbNA] We Live &amp; Breath Letterboxing Event - No posts?<o:p></o:p></span></p></div></div><p><o:p> </o:p></p><p>  <o:p></o:p></p><div id="ygrp-mlmsg"><div id="ygrp-msg"><div id="ygrp-text"><p>Howdy Tom, good to hear from you again.  Wish you could have been at Live &amp; Breathe XV so I could have talked to you some more about your boxes.  When I met you 4 years ago I did not realize you still have boxes from 1998 with original contents, so when you mentioned them last year I made a point of adding them to my itinerary for this trip.  After the Event, my brother Baby Bear and I went to the Braintree area and found the Panther box placed on 11/26/98 and Rolling Rock letterbox, placed on 9/26/98.  Both were doing well with very few visitors.  As far as I know, Rolling Rock is the oldest letterbox with original contents, but if anyone knows of one older I would love to hear about it.  <br/><br/>Silver Eagle<o:p></o:p></p><p> <o:p></o:p></p><div><p><br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com">letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;<a href="mailto:letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com">letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<o:p></o:p></p><div><p>Greetings,<o:p></o:p></p><div><p><o:p> </o:p></p></div><div><p>I am delighted to hear that Prayer Rock is still in place.

Was also shocked at how many people did not even know about this talk list that were at event (many of which did not know any of the Founders names either). Shocking. As for me, had a great time meeting these founders and getting to know them. Best part of event was sitting around the dinning hall talking and sharing stories. <br/><br/>After event Silver Eagle and I traveled up to Vermont and found the oldest box (Prayer Rock), and the oldest surviving original box still in place as planted, all in 1 day!!!! Sad thing was no one had been to either box in years. <br/><br/>Thanks to all that put on event, and all that attended! Great fun and great people!!!!</p></div></div></blockquote></div><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
