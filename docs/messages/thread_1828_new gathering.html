different kind of gathering in conjunction with the 4-H county fair <br/>
held at the same location in August ( date TBA ) . We will probably <br/>
just have a check in booth or tent type thing. There will be a new <br/>
set of event boxes for the weekend and an event stamp. You would need <br/>
to pay the nominal parking fee to the fair which is small fair wise <br/>
but very kid friendly.  I can't be as involved as all my 4-H kids <br/>
will be there with animals and I have so much directing and crisis <br/>
intervention to do( I forgot my cow shampoo!) . There will be more <br/>
new boxes in the area by then from myself and Roseann ( Penguin) who <br/>
lives nearby.   Noonetheless it is " in the works" like to meet more <br/>
of you then!   Carolyn - in what a great day we had!<br/>
