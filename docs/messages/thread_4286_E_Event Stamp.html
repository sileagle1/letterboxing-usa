gathering, an event stamp was created and since it was just available <br/>
at the event, it was not found or placed or really exchanged--<br/>
Although many thanks to Paisley Orca for her carving!!<br/>

PS--<br/>
I have a squadron coin (given to me by a Marine) But I am not sure of <br/>
the coin etiquette.  Since I wasn't actually in the Squadron do I get <br/>
to participate? (in the event I am ever in a bar where coins are <br/>
being thrown down!) I had no idea that these things had anything <br/>
other than sentimental value, until another military guy saw my coin <br/>
and got all excited about it.<br/>
 I live in fear that <br/>
&gt; I will be found without my squadron coin - especially near a bar - <br/>
&gt; where money runs out of one's pockets like water through seemingly <br/>
&gt; sealed tupperware. Perhaps, for the good of Boston pubs, such a <br/>
&gt; punishment could be decreed by the Lords and Ladies of LbNA.  At <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; very least, this should be required at meetings of letterboxers.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finally, I saw a posting several weeks back that listed P, F, X and <br/>
&gt; E.  I foolishly asked what E might stand for, foolish because no <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; answered and here I sit asking again....<br/>
