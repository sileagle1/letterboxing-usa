                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I found Drewclan's wonderful box in a beautiful location at <br/>
Hammonasett Beach State Park. This box is alive and well. The log <br/>
book is full, but people have been writing on the backs of the pages <br/>
and that works well. (Perhaps that's what you're always supposed to <br/>
do -- I never saw a book that full before, so I didn't know!) Also <br/>
this box has a great stamp!<br/>
<br/>
But wait!... there's more...<br/>
When I lifted up the rocks covering it, I was surprised and amazed <br/>
to see not one box, but two! The second box was the "Churchill on <br/>
the Road" hitchhiker. It is the first time I have ever found a <br/>
hitchhiker and I am absolutely thrilled! It will be a couple of days <br/>
or so before I have a chance to send him on his way again.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have a question:<br/>
Having never found a hitchhiker before, I had imagined that the HH <br/>
did not have its own container, but was just a stamp and book in a <br/>
ziplock bag placed inside the container of the host box.  But that <br/>
was not the case with "Churchill" -- he has his own container. So my <br/>
question is: Is that the way that hitchhikers are normally done, or <br/>
can it be either way?  The reason I would like to know is because I <br/>
hope to create a hitchhiker myself soon, and I want to do it "right" <br/>
(if there is such a thing as "right"...)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance to anyone who replies!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Churchill and the Pinecone for my first hitchhiker find!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Drewclan for the Hammonasett box, and all of your <br/>
wonderful boxes!<br/>
