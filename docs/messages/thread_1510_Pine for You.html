It took us a little while, it was very well hidden. We made sure no one saw<br/>
us and covered it back up well. The pond was beautiful and the weather was<br/>
great.<br/>
<br/>
So we've found four in Mansfield, anyone know how many more in Mansfield,<br/>
CT. Carolyn, any ideas... We'd like to get all the local ones done before we<br/>

Hiya! You can see the complete list of Mansfield letterboxes by going <br/>
to the main website (www.letterboxing.org). Click on CT, then <br/>
Hartford, then Mansfield, and up will pop the listing and a decent <br/>
map of the locations. Those Cocka-doodle-moo letterboxes are GREAT!<br/>

I wouldn't follow the map for the Mansfield boxes, the locations are grossly<br/>
inaccurate for the Mansfield area, i.e. the eaglevile box is shown as being<br/>
at the intersection of routes 44 and 32 when in fact it is seven miles south<br/>
of that location at the intersections of 32 and 275. I don't think there was<br/>
a single point on the map in the right location. At this point I rely on the<br/>
written directions, Carolyn has done a great job with directions to her<br/>
letter boxe! :-) Here again is a problem, Carolyn has informed me she has 16<br/>
in Mansfield, however there are only 10 on the web site. It could be I am<br/>
not quite understanding the map or the web site but I would love to find the<br/>
other 6 in question. Any ideas?<br/>
