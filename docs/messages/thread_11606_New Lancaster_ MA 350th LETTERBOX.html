Lancaster is a small residential town located on the banks of the Nashua <br/>
River, 35 miles west of Boston. It is the oldest town in Worcester County. <br/>
The town was to be called Prescott in honor of its leader, John Prescott. The <br/>
General Court, at first, granted this request. Then someone in authority, <br/>
remembering that not even a governor of the colony had been honored in this <br/>
way, objected to exalting Prescott, a blacksmith, who was not even a freeman. <br/>
Another petition was presented asking the General Court to honor John <br/>
Prescott by remembering his home in England. So, on the 16th of May 1653, <br/>
Lancaster was named and two days later officially became the Town of <br/>
Lancaster.<br/>
<br/>
Notes of interest:<br/>
**A Civil War Encampment will be enacted June 6-8, 2003. The open house and <br/>
demonstrations will be located 1/4 mile south of the Town Green on Main <br/>
Street, beside the Nashua River. While there look for the Mary Rowlandson <br/>
Marker.<br/>
**Charles Bulfinch designed the First Church of Christ, on the Town Green. <br/>
The Church, built in 1816, also contains a Paul Revere Bell.<br/>
**The Thayer Memorial Library, on the Town Green, was built in honor of <br/>
Lancaster’s Civil War Veterans. The Library houses the town Historical <br/>
Archives and a museum. <br/>
