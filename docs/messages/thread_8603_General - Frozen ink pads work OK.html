&gt;  freeze? Will they be okay after they thaw out?  Any info or <br/>
&gt; links to more info will be much appreciated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
I have used pigment pads in many of my boxes.  Certainly, they are OK <br/>
when they thaw... they are also usually OK to use when the <br/>
temperature is in the upper 20s.  The water does not seem to freeze <br/>
in the pigment.  Maybe it is something like salt keeping the water <br/>
from freezing.  <br/>
<br/>
I have had more problem with the box getting frozen in mud. <br/>
