There are clues to a box in my home state that read:<br/>
<br/>
Find Some Blueberries<br/>
Twenty-Two Steps Behind<br/>
Near Tree On Mound<br/>
<br/>
I can't help but look for this every day,(really, every single day I<br/>
step outside!) I just can't seem to find it, and I really want to... I<br/>
have however never tried to tell the placer that the box is missing or<br/>
that the clues ought to be rewritten...<br/>
<br/>
I also can't drive anywhere from my home without passing a large<br/>
landmark that has a known box hidden there. I know that it is there.<br/>
I've looked for it many times. I haven't found it yet. I LOVE the fact<br/>
that I can gaze upon the mountain daily knowing that there is a box I<br/>
haven't been able to find yet. I will find it eventually, and will<br/>
feel triumphant. I also won't get the same feeling looking at the<br/>
mountain as I do now knowing that a challenge is awaiting me.<br/>
<br/>
tough clues, i love 'em.<br/>
the point I am trying to make is that they are called clues, and not<br/>
'instructions'.<br/>
maybe we need different databases!<br/>

Ha! (laughs to self) I know these clues, (they're not mine either...!) and nope, I haven't <br/>
found 'em either! Again, kudos to those folks that come up with imaginative clues <br/>
and force you to read between the lines.<br/>
<br/>
I believe Sadie &amp; Russ deserve some credits for these wonderful contributions.<br/>
Thanks guys,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Some people prefer easy clues and some hard. To each their own. I'm a newbie and I've only done easy clues for boxes that I've placed so far but I've been inspired by Sanfroid's last two boxes (one I found, one not) to try my hand at hard clues and I'm finding them surprisingly hard to write, but I'm still workng on it in my spare time.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding clue difficulty, I'm not bummed out when I give an honest effort to find a box and come up dry for whatever reason. For me, the excuse to get out somewhere I've never been is reward enough. <br/>

I also like using the compass to find the clues ie. degree markings. I  think this makes it a bit more difficult to locate a box in case someone acidentally tells a non boxer about one of their finds. Without full details and a compass your not as likely to trip accross it.<br/>
My daughters and I recently went out on a 3 box hike. I do need to admit that we didn't get to the last one  the park was closing and we needed flashlights as it was to find our way out. The second box that we found however took us some great hunting and pecking skills and just as we were about to call it a night I happened to look down and saw a piece of granite that I thought was just more boulder and low and behold box # 2 Glad we didn't call it a night any sooner.<br/>
keep up the hunt<br/>

of clues. Most of my boxes are simple directions with a <br/>
few compass points but a couple are more difficult. I have <br/>
one placed in a library with a simple puzzle that anyone <br/>
can solve if they visit a couple spots in the library. I'm <br/>
working on one now that uses a cryptogram. I love using <br/>
and writing the different types. My favorite type are poem <br/>
puzzles but I don't seem be to able to write them. Maybe <br/>
that's why I appreciate them!<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of boxes that I've attempted and failed <br/>
to find, like sangfroid's "quascacunquen" in Newbury, MA. <br/>
I'm looking to taking a fresh look for them in the spring!<br/>
