post. If you've had car trouble today or if your rent check is overdue, <br/>
please spare yourself this added stress and log off. For those of you who enjoy the <br/>
masochistic side of life, read on. . . .<br/>
<br/>
You brave and intrepid would-be rescuers of the precious Baudelare orphans, <br/>
we're afraid we have bad news. . . DOUBLE bad news, actually, for not only did <br/>
we miss capturing that scoundrel, Count Olaf but we fear his shiftiness and <br/>
diabolical intentions now include another even more horrendous art. We believe <br/>
he has somehow come into the secret of controlling the weather!! What more can <br/>
we expect these children to endure? Is Violet having her hair brushed properly <br/>
each day? Does Klaus get a comic book now and then? And Sunny, dear, sweet <br/>
Sunny. . .Ah, but I digress.<br/>
<br/>
We'd finished two weeks of research and decided we'd finally found the <br/>
Count's new hiding place somewhere in the Northwest. We hopped on the red eye <br/>
plotting to rise at the crack of dawn to track him down, like the RAT that he is! <br/>
Somehow, he knew--he found out our plans as the morning's dawn was obscured by <br/>
the pitiful drumming of a solid rain the likes of which hadn't been seen for <br/>
WEEKS! I tell you, Olaf had something to do with this!! <br/>
<br/>
Undaunted, we procured rain gear and mustered the moxy needed to bushwhack <br/>
hip-high ferns, dripping evergreens and the dreaded stinging nettles thinking <br/>
nothing of our own pain and discomfort--those POOR, POOR children, after all!! <br/>
<br/>
As we approached Olaf's secret camp we thought we heard a low, pathetic <br/>
sobbing but we were too late! He'd made off with them AGAIN! Left only with crude <br/>
scrawling in some sort of journal and a rude image of his repulsive self, we <br/>
stood there soaking, saddened and skunked. . . once again. Oh that our tears for <br/>
those forlorn little angels could buy their freedom, for we've spilled enough <br/>
of them over the months!<br/>
<br/>
We implore you all, never give up! <br/>
<br/>
Respectfully submitted,<br/>
