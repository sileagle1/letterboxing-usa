Hi, Robin! The search page is working fine...what you're getting is <br/>
a blank page since there are no virtual boxes listed in NY. I think <br/>
database weenies call that a "null result." And since the bottom of <br/>
each page has the disclaimer link....<br/>
<br/>
Instead, try searching "virtual" without a state.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck! Jay in CT<br/>

Oops, except there is only one listed at lbna if you look that way. <br/>
Instead, try this reasonably complete list, taken from the "files" <br/>
section here at the yahoogroup:<br/>

Here's a list of virtual letterboxes, created Feb. 9, 2004, which is <br/>
probably not complete. Please feel free to update and re-upload it <br/>
as you please.<br/>

You DO realize that a virtual box has no physical location....right? <br/>
That's why you are finding none in NY.  Or maybe I'm missing <br/>
something here, which, if it is indeed the case, someone please <br/>
straighten me out because it's always been my understanding that a <br/>
virtual is not actually a "box" per say.. but rather a computer <br/>
based hunt.   Kstar<br/>
