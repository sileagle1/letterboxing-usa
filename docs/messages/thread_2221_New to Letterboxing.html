                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am new to letterboxing.  Found my first letterbox by chance and got<br/>
interested.<br/>
<br/>
My first letterbox: Carolie's Bench at Selden Creek in CT.  Thanks to Pete<br/>
and Wanda, their note in the first letterbox let me know that there is a<br/>
second letterbox at that location.  I can report that both letterboxes at<br/>
Carolie's Bench are live and well.  The spot is great and is one you can see<br/>
the Connecticut River eagles from.<br/>
<br/>
I have since visited the Hamonasett Beach CT letterbox and my compliments to<br/>
the Drewclan for some great locations.<br/>
<br/>
I have always lived by the "...leave only footprints" creed and it is nice<br/>
to find a group dedicated to that.  My father always said you should leave<br/>
it better (cleaner) than you found it when ever possible.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to many letterbox adventures.<br/>

  I don't know if Sis  will be able to look around AK  Anchorage <br/>
right now.  I think it would be a good idea for her to (get her feet <br/>
wet) get started there so she has a clear idea how it all works.  Now <br/>
that spring has finally come to Wisconsin, My husband and I will be <br/>
out and about, with vigor placing and finding boxes in our lovely <br/>
state.   I do think it would be a great idea for my Sis and her <br/>
family to place some boxes around her state.  I will pass the idea <br/>
onto her and thanks Donna, for the idea.  Sierra  <br/>

I just want to introduce myself and ask a few questions. There is still some confusion in my mind about the process.<br/>
1) Is the only website to locate clues letterboxing.org?<br/>
2) Once you find the box you stamp the pad and leave the box?<br/>
3) You create your own box and hiding place?<br/>
4) What is the difference between letterboxing and geo caching?<br/>

<br/>
1. No, many folks have clues on their own websites and on other<br/>
websites such as atlasquest.com.<br/>
2. Stamp the pad with your stamp and use the stamp in the box to stamp<br/>
your logbook. Then re-hide the box very well.<br/>
3. You can create your own box and plant it and post the clues. I<br/>
would suggest finding some boxes b/4 you plant one so you get a feel<br/>
for how the boxes work.<br/>
4. Letterboxing uses stamps and clues, geocaches uses coordinates and<br/>
people trade out trinkets and stuff in a box.<br/>
<br/>
Please read the FAQ on the website, sign up for the newboxers group<br/>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers), and check out silent doug's<br/>
site which has a ton of useful info (www.letterboxing.info)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

&gt; I am now.   I searched for letterbox, letterboxing, and Michigan,<br/>
&gt; and didnt find any groups.<br/>
<br/>
There's also a group for every state on Atlas Quest, though I haven't<br/>
seen much activity specifically about Michigan in particular. The<br/>
Great Lakes group seems like the "main" group for Michigonians.<br/>

Welcome to letterboxing!  Here are the basics...<br/>
<br/>
What you need:<br/>
*Rubber Stamp - usually a hand-carved or store-bought rubber stamp.  This is your "signature stamp" that represents you and your family.<br/>
*Blank journal to use as a "logbook"<br/>
*Ink pad(s) - some letterboxes will include an ink pad; most in my area do not.<br/>
*Pen or pencil<br/>
*Clues to letterbox(es)<br/>
<br/>
What you do:<br/>
*Follow the clues to locate the letterbox<br/>
*Open the box, making sure you notice how everything was packaged.<br/>
*Ink up the rubber stamp from the letterbox and make an impression in your logbook.<br/>
*Ink up your signature stamp and make an impression in the letterbox's logbook.<br/>
*Leave a note to the planter in the letterbox's logbook - about the hike, the weather, how you liked the box, etc.<br/>
*Repackage the letterbox the way you found it, making sure all ziplock bags are sealed and the container is sealed properly.<br/>
*Replace the letterbox where you found it, making sure it is completely hidden from view.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, this is the bare basics, but there are many "best practices", nuances and much, much more to discover.  I would strongly recommend that you also join the New Letterboxers yahoo group at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/.  They are very friendly and helpful in answering any other questions you might have.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>
SandiBox<br/>

I would add one more thing to SandiBox's list.  It would be nice to contact the placer on whatever site the clues were found to let him/her/them that you found it and what the condition is - or if it is obviously missing.  The placer may not be in the same area and won't be able to check on the box.  <br/>

And, if you decide at some point to try your hand at carving and placing your own box, and while hunting them down that it is extremely important to disturb the area's foliage as little as humanly possible. Definitely print, read, and re-read the code of conduct. Seems too often new boxers are so excited to begin that this is overlooked. <br/>

Have a ball! It IS a wonderful pastime be it solitary or family hobby!<br/>

Instead I would recommend finding the group that is local to you.  You will be better informed on the common practices of the local boxing population as well as get a better feel for things closer to home.  Sometimes you will even get clues to boxes you would not find listed anywhere else.<br/>

Most of your questions can be answered on the AQ boards, or just by perusing the site.  I started on letterboxing.org, and read through much of what they had to offer.  It's all good.  Then just get started.  I had to be prodded to plant my first box.  I had so many questions - and was told to just get my butt in gear and do it, and stop fretting about it.  That was the best advice!  You really will "learn as you go."<br/>

&gt;I disagree! I think every letterboxer has the right to belong to any Yahoo, Facebook or Myspace  <br/>
Letterboxing group. I think new boxers should explore all the possible resources. True that they should connect on a local level, they should also be connected to the rest of the national community. How would you like it if when you were a new boxer were told that you shouldn't join this group or that one. I know that I wouldn't like that, All I would be wanting to do is learn more about this great hobby. For most new boxers joining different is one of the many different ways to learn. That is what I think!<br/>

I am sorry, but I *must* disagree with you on this.  The Newboxers Group is a great place for new letterboxers (and even grizzled vets) to ask questions.  The membership is very helpful, and is willing to answer the same questions over and over for each new person who shows up in the Group :-)  I know something of why you feel otherwise, and occasionally I even agree with you, a little ;-)  You are entitled to your opinion, and you did a nice job of expressing it without being vitriolic.  But I have the opposite opinion, and I felt that it needed to be expressed, as well.<br/>
