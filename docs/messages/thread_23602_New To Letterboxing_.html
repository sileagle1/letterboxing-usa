We just started! Found out about it by accident, and thought it <br/>
sounded great.<br/>
<br/>
We attempted 3 our first day - only located one. We think one was <br/>
missed, and we think the other was moved.<br/>
<br/>
The next day - hit one - another was moved.<br/>
<br/>
Today... we found 8! 7 normal ones, and a hitchhiker!<br/>

Just wanted to invite you to join the Letterbox Great Lakes Yahoo! group.  We are a regional group of letterboxers in the western Great Lakes states -- MI, IL, IN, OH, WI, MN.  The regional group is a great place to get to know others in your area, learn about gatherings near you and just keep up with what is going on in letterboxing at a level a little closer to home.<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you are interested, there is a Yahoo! group for new letterboxers that is a good place to get all your questions answered and interact with other boxers who are where you are with the game.<br/>
<br/>

Welcome!  Sounds like you are already having a great time with it!<br/>

never know when they might change.  I've had to change some of mi <br/>
clues due to animal invasion or other legitimate reasons and I hate <br/>
to do it thinking about those preprinted clues leading someone <br/>

&gt;   &gt; We attempted 3 our first day - only located one. We think one <br/>
was <br/>

&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; The next day - hit one - another was moved.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Welcome to the group!!! My family and I just joined a couple <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt; weeks ago, and we make a day out of it each weekend!!! I <br/>
&gt; stumbled <br/>
&gt; &gt; across letterboxing too by chance. We are in the Chicago <br/>
&gt; suburbs, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and we go anywhere and everywhere in the Northen Illinois area, <br/>
&gt; as <br/>
&gt; &gt; for right now. LOL We've printed out almost all the clues on <br/>
&gt; &gt; Atlasquest and Letterboxing.org and have them in folders. THe <br/>
&gt; kids <br/>
&gt; &gt; have a blast, and it's great for family time!! =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We just started! Found out about it by accident, and thought <br/>
&gt; &gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sounded great.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We attempted 3 our first day - only located one. We think <br/>
&gt; one <br/>
&gt; &gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; missed, and we think the other was moved.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The next day - hit one - another was moved.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Today... we found 8! 7 normal ones, and a hitchhiker!<br/>
