could give us some idea as to where would be a good place to stay for <br/>
the night . We are looking forward to seeing every one . Does anybody <br/>
know how many are expected to attend ? We will be on the trails early <br/>
and hope to run into some other early risers for that seemingly all <br/>
too allusive trail side exchange . A gathering tomorrow and then a <br/>
week long vacation in Maine hunting boxes .... We are in heaven ! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks All !!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, Brian. We had trouble finding any hotel room, much less a <br/>
reasonably priced one. Apparently there are a lot of college <br/>
graduations this weekend...lots of families in town. We ended up with <br/>
reservations in Danbury (and cheap's not in it!). Hope someone <br/>
familiar with the area can be of more help. Good luck and we'll see <br/>
you tomorrow!<br/>
