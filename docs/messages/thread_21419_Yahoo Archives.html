Just a head-up to those of you who think your private Yahoo group mail<br/>
is, well, private. Please take this seriously, and either don't keep<br/>
archives for your group, or delete them at least once a year. I've<br/>
seen old stored messages come back to bite someone more than once.....<br/>
even if they were in a private group. A group can be considered public<br/>
if anyone can join it without permission from the moderator. If the<br/>
group was ever set up that way, the messages sent out during that time<br/>
frame are usable by Yahoo for just about anything. Keeping your group<br/>
private offers a bit more security, but it's not fool-proof.<br/>
<br/>
An alternative, if you have always-on internet connections like Road<br/>
Runner is to set up a list through Listserv.light-side, as that runs<br/>
on your computer and nothing is stored with a third party like Yahoo.<br/>
<br/>
XXXXXXX<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo TOS:<br/>
<br/>
They can keep your private information for however long they want to,<br/>
for basically any reason, and if DSS wants to get information on you<br/>
about how your homeschool your children in order to help them with<br/>
their case against you, they can get a court order and get a copy of<br/>
every post you've made, twisting the words into another meaning in<br/>
order to use them against you:<br/>
<br/>
You acknowledge, consent and agree that Yahoo! may access, preserve,<br/>
and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so<br/>
by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or<br/>
disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process;<br/>
(b) enforce the TOS; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates<br/>
the rights of third-parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer<br/>
service; or (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of<br/>
Yahoo!, its users and the public.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your posts are not secure even on private groups:<br/>
<br/>
You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the<br/>
Service, including your Content, may involve (a) transmissions over<br/>
various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical<br/>
requirements of connecting networks or devices.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Grants them the right to use your private posts in basically any way,<br/>
once they deem them "publicly accessible" which can happen after<br/>
messages have been deleted from your group due to lack of room, if the<br/>
moderator ever makes the group open to public membership, if someone<br/>
copies your message and sends it through a public group or posts it on<br/>
a message board, if the group is ever closed but archives not deleted,<br/>
etc:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    * With respect to Content you submit or make available for<br/>
inclusion on publicly accessible areas of Yahoo! Groups, the license<br/>
to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and<br/>
publicly display such Content on the Service solely for the purposes<br/>
of providing and promoting the specific Yahoo! Group to which such<br/>
Content was submitted or made available. This license exists only for<br/>
as long as you elect to continue to include such Content on the<br/>
Service and will terminate at the time you remove or Yahoo! removes<br/>
such Content from the Service.<br/>
<br/>
    * With respect to photos, graphics, audio or video you submit or<br/>
make available for inclusion on publicly accessible area of the<br/>
Service other than Yahoo! Groups, the license to use, distribute,<br/>
reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display such<br/>
Content on the Service solely for the purpose for which such Content<br/>
was submitted or made available. This license exists only for as long<br/>
as you elect to continue to include such Content on the Service and<br/>
will terminate at the time you remove or Yahoo! removes such Content<br/>

<br/>
    * With respect to Content other than photos, graphics, audio or<br/>
video you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly<br/>
accessible areas of the Service other than Yahoo! Groups, the<br/>
perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable license to use,<br/>
distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly<br/>
perform and publicly display such Content (in whole or in part) and to<br/>
incorporate such Content into other works in any format or medium now<br/>
known or later developed.<br/>
<br/>
You can't do a thing about them using your posts in this way:<br/>
<br/>
You agree to indemnify and hold Yahoo!, and its subsidiaries,<br/>
affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders or other partners, and<br/>
employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable<br/>
attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of<br/>
Content you submit, post, transmit or make available through the<br/>
Service, your use of the Service, your connection to the Service, your<br/>
violation of the TOS, or your violation of any rights of another.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And this lets them get out of the "public-only" posts that they say<br/>
they can use in any way and lets them get the private ones too, if<br/>
they want:<br/>
<br/>
You further acknowledge that Yahoo! reserves the right to modify these<br/>
general practices and limits from time to time.<br/>

Funny you should bring up this topic! Just yesterday, I was <br/>
talking with one of the first letterboxers in the country, <br/>
Der Mad Stamper, about the archives on this list. Two <br/>
nights earlier I had tried to track down a couple of very <br/>
amusing posts from 2002, ones that marked an<br/>
entertaining prank, perpetrated by the famed <br/>
Legerdemaine. I wanted to share them with a friend who<br/>
is relatively new to letterboxing and wasn't lucky enough<br/>
to be involve when Legerdemaine was an active participant.<br/>
<br/>
At that point I found that I could only access posts from <br/>
2003 and later! With that situation newbies would be unable<br/>
to learn about any of the early history of the hobby in<br/>
the United States. Apparently, amongst the first entries on<br/>
this list there was posted a collection of all pre-Talk List<br/>
communications between the earliest letterboxers,<br/>
those who created LbNA. <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, these early entries appear to back in action as<br/>
of today. I am most relieved! Rather than warning folks to<br/>
remove the archives, I want to point out the value of re-<br/>
taining them. Anyone who wants to learn letterboxing <br/>
history and learn about it's development should always<br/>
have access to this information. Funhog<br/>

I agree. Browsing around the early archives is a lot of fun and gives <br/>
a sense of what it was like when there really were no rules and folks <br/>
were making this up as they went along.<br/>
<br/>
I'd also add that there are clues in the archives. Or at least posts <br/>
that give direction to clues. And (I think) some of those boxes are <br/>
still unfound years later.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think there are upsides and downsides to both ways of looking at it.  Yes, <br/>
it's great for folks new to any group to be able to go back and read past <br/>
posts.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, yahoo "owns" everything on that site.  They can use it <br/>
wherever they want to.  I once posted some photography work of mine to the files <br/>
of a group, expecting the photography to be just viewed by the members of the <br/>
group for the entertainment of those members.  Nope.  My photos began turning <br/>
up in greeting cards put out by yahoo.  The only way to avoid that was to put <br/>
the photography in the files section for only a short time and then remove it. <br/>
 But that means any new group members wouldn't be able to see it.  But so be <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I've also had trouble in the past with artwork I'd done being posted to <br/>
another website -- a website that happened to be owned by yahoo.  There was nothing <br/>
I could do about it.  Yahoo had the right to do it.  Poetry, artwork, short <br/>
stories, etc. -- can all be used by yahoo once they've been placed on yahoo in <br/>
a group post or file.<br/>
<br/>
This is one reason why Keith, a professional photographer, won't post any of <br/>
his work to any yahoo files.  <br/>

Seems someone has jumped onto the paranoia bandwagon, but that TOS<br/>
looks  like a pretty standard template to me.  And pretty logical, to<br/>
boot.  If a moderator makes the board public, all the messages will be<br/>
public too?  Well, this board has always been open to the public.<br/>
<br/>
They can use files, photos and posts to help promote their site? <br/>
That's pretty standard too.  Not many companies are willing to stand<br/>
up and say, "Hey, we don't want to make money.  Let's not promote our<br/>
product."<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't mean not to use the service--just read the terms of service<br/>
and know what they can or cannot do.  You're not likely to find better<br/>
terms somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
I'd definitely be against deleting the older messages of the<br/>
archives--they're a part of letterboxing history.  I've even been<br/>
thinking about crawling the website myself to store all of the<br/>
messages in case Yahoo ever decides to delete some of the old<br/>
messages.  It sounds like they may very well do that if the board<br/>
starts taking up too much space which would be a travesty indeed.  If<br/>
Yahoo won't preserve old messages, perhaps we should take the<br/>
initiative ourselves.<br/>

That message was a repost and went out to over 90 email loops.  Each<br/>
one handle their loop differently.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't have the time to email each separate one, a different<br/>
message.  There are some groups that discuss things like cures for<br/>
genital herpes, and such that I'm sure would not want their names<br/>
coming up on the internet, or even their email addresses (as you can<br/>
find lot's of info on folks like that).<br/>
<br/>
I also post my family photos, my childrens drawings, writings, etc.<br/>
and I believed that folks needed the info.  That's why I sent it<br/>
without modifying it.<br/>
<br/>
I moderate almost 70 loops, and I'm on an additional 20.  Thanks for<br/>
understanding.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I'd definitely be against deleting the older messages of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; archives--they're a part of letterboxing history.  I've even been<br/>
&gt; &gt; thinking about crawling the website myself to store all of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; messages in case Yahoo ever decides to delete some of the old<br/>
&gt; &gt; messages.  It sounds like they may very well do that if the board<br/>
&gt; &gt; starts taking up too much space which would be a travesty indeed.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yahoo won't preserve old messages, perhaps we should take the<br/>
&gt; &gt; initiative ourselves.<br/>

&gt; Okay, you've piqued my curiosity...<br/>
&gt; How are you going to do that and keep up AQ, too? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
*shrug*  In theory, it wouldn't be too hard to make a program that<br/>
would crawl the whole message board and store the messages somewhere.<br/>
 I'd just do it so there was a backup of the talk list in the event<br/>
Yahoo ever decided to delete old messages.  At that point, I'd have to<br/>
figure out a way of making them accessible online, but for now it<br/>
would just be a "gather the data" to insure it'll never be lost.  I<br/>
could probably get something working within a couple of days without<br/>
much trouble.<br/>
<br/>
It sure would be nice to have a better alternative than their search<br/>
options for searching the archives, though.  The Yahoo search box is<br/>
bloody awful.  *daydreaming*  =)<br/>

Mr. Peabody appears to be off his game today, since the messages do<br/>
not actually show up in the wayback machine archives. Doh!<br/>

Yeah, but would you trust it?  It's an automated collector of<br/>
information and there's no guarantee they'll preserve the content of<br/>
the messages, nor make it easily accessible for searching.<br/>
<br/>
You know the saying, if you want something done right, you'll have to<br/>
do it yourself.  ;o)<br/>
