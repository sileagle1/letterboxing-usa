                    <html><body>Yes,to keep park rangers from throwing letterbox`s away ,us letterbox makers(you know who you are) should put a label on the front of the letterbox reading the floowing message,or something like it....<i>Do not throw this letterbox away,it is a SAFE HOBBY that hikers/cluefinders partcipate in,it cannot hurt the enviroment in anyway,shape or form,for more information on letterboxing visit this web site ,www.LetterBoxing.org.....</i>This can be written on paper then placed on the cover of the letterbox,with see-through,waterproof ,long lasting tape,or Â with a label maker(which is what I recomend,but the tape is what most people have,I don`t think I have a label maker,I have to check..)Anyways a good idea huh?
<br/>
<br/>What inspired this idea...well my mom thought of it,I am giving it ot you,I was surfing the web tionight when I realized the calico letterbox was missing,it was probally the rangers whop through it away,but it could have been anywtjhing else(idiots,animals ect..)Anyways thats my idea,m so talk list take in thought ,bye

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If somebody's out to remove a box, they're gonna remove it whether or <br/>
not there's a message saying not to remove the box.  It IS useful for <br/>
those wonderful people that find it by accident and pick it up <br/>
thinking it's trash and realize too late that it's not.  I like to <br/>
think that my boxes are so well hidden, though, that they never get <br/>
found by accident and thus don't need such a disclaimer.  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; it cannot hurt the enviroment in anyway,shape or form<br/>
<br/>
I've seem some letterboxes where it's pretty obvious someone looking <br/>
for the box was digging around a little too harshly.  And there's a <br/>
certain box in Arches National Park about 50 steps out on ground <br/>
where there are signs plastered everywhere saying not to go off the <br/>
trail because a single footprint can cause decades of damage to the <br/>
soil.  <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing most certainly CAN hurt the environment, and if we want <br/>
to make sure rangers, administrators, and property owners allow us to <br/>
hide letterboxes, we've got to show them we can do it responsibily <br/>
without hurting the environment.  Responsible letterboxing is a must!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; it was probally the rangers whop through it away,but it could have <br/>
&gt; been anywtjhing else(idiots,animals ect..)<br/>
<br/>
I kind of think it probably was NOT the rangers or anyone in charge <br/>
because I think they would have been inclined to email me saying they <br/>
pulled the letterbox and get the clue off the website ASAP with the <br/>
usual reasons for why they frown on hiding letterboxes in the area.  <br/>
If you want my guess, I'm betting an animal lodged it loose where it <br/>
was left exposed for someone to find and probably throw away thinking <br/>
it was trash.  (Shoots my nobody will ever find my letterboxes by <br/>
accident theory to holes, though, doesn't it?  *smile*)<br/>
