&gt;   Hello, <br/>
&gt;   I just read the article about Letterboxing in the Bristol Phoenix<br/>
and I was very interested, I have never heard of it before. I was just<br/>
wondering if the stamp that you carry to mark in the journals of the<br/>
boxes you find, should match that of the stamp that is in a box that<br/>
you hide. This way I figure, if people locate your box they can<br/>
recognize where you have been before. If someone could let me know the<br/>
answer to this question that would be great. I can't wait to get<br/>
started!! <br/>
&gt;   Thank You, <br/>
&gt;   Kristen. Bristol, Rhode Island<br/>

Hi Kristen,<br/>
Glad to hear of your newfound interestin boxing. welcome.<br/>
<br/>
here's my take on it...there's two things that are part of the<br/>
letterboxing mystique if you will, first of all...the stamp that you<br/>
find in a letterbox is usually unique in and of itself. The stamp<br/>
reflects either the content of the clue, subject matter being sort of<br/>
people, place, event or thing. So for example - I placed a box in<br/>
Rhode Island as a mystery and it was entitled: <a<br>
href="http://home.gwi.net/~moxie1/Clues/Providence.html"&gt;I AM<br/>
PROVIDENCE but without giving away the location, you can already<br/>
guess that it's 1) in Rhode Island and/or close to and/or located in<br/>
Providence....and that the stamp when you find it will reflect the<br/>
subject matter.<br/>
<br/>
So, when I design a letterbox for placement, I've got a particular<br/>
person, place or thing that relates to the clue as well as the stamp.<br/>
In theory, none of the stamps that I've created are ever going to look<br/>
the same. They are each unique to the place that I had in mind to<br/>
plant a box. <br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, my personal "signature stamp" also reflects my own unique<br/>
letterboxing persona. If you've seen my stamp then you'll understand<br/>
however, your personal stamp is usually something that nobody else<br/>
will have. If you were to create boxes that contained stamps that were<br/>
the same as your signature stamp then everytime someone found a box,<br/>
they'd always have your stamp in their logbook instead of a stamp that<br/>
might help them remember their adventure in a particular state or<br/>
location or perhaps date.<br/>
<br/>
The beauty of letterboxing is getting to pour through your old<br/>
logbooks and seeing all the different stamps. Each stamp will help you<br/>
to remember what the search was all about. If all you had in your<br/>
logbook were 100+ phyto signature stamps, then I'd say you're logbook<br/>
might get boring!!!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers to the new year,<br/>

I just wanted to add that a lot of what Phyto speaks of involves carving your own stamp, either personal or for a box. A lot of us do this exclusively. There definitely are, however, personal stamps and box stamps that are store-bought or even professionally commissioned). Whichever you decide to do, find something that really reflects who you are.<br/>
<br/>
If you are just starting out, you may want to read the FAQ on Letterboxing.org and also check out Atlasquest. Also, check out the New Letterboxers yahoo talk list as well. There are a lot of great answers and ideas to be had there.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, welcome to our addiction/hobby/sport/art/game. I will warn you, this talk list has its ups and downs in terms of passions flaring up and arguments happening and people 'taking their ball and going home', but don't ever let this forum be mistaken for Letterboxing itself. When you go to your first letterboxing gathering and meet people in person, you'll realize you're in the company of fun, amazing and very friendly people.<br/>
<br/>
Again, welcome!<br/>
