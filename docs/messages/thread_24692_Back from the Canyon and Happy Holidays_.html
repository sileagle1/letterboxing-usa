Finally getting a chance to revisit the talklist on an icy day between sending out Christmas <br/>
cards and going out to see our annual production of Christmas Carol! Yes, I'm back from <br/>
the canyon again, but this time it's from Frijoles Canyon in New Mexico, where I had a <br/>
great time last month visiting places like Bandelier, etc. My "heartsong" is still with the <br/>
Grand Canyon, however, so I just wanted to add a few words of warning, so that <br/>
letterboxers and other folks would be sure to understand that what I accomplished out <br/>
there should definitely NOT be attempted by the faint of heart, or probably anyone else in <br/>
their right mind either, for that matter!!!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it 's probably true that close to 5 million people a year visit the Grand Canyon, so <br/>
that in itself is certainly not a "big deal", over 99% of them merely viewing it from above! <br/>
Of the small fraction of a percent that actually gets to experience looking up to the rim <br/>
from below, most are only going a short distance, taking mule trips, or taking overnight <br/>
backpacking trips, like Pete and I did 15 years ago, before  camping fees and pay permits <br/>
were even required!  Even of those folks that do make it to the bottom, almost all come <br/>
back up to the same rim, and only the tiniest fraction  continue on climbing up to the <br/>
other side. These folks generally plan well in advance, train for months, and take several <br/>
days to complete their journeys, but it certainly can be done even by people getting on in <br/>
age, as my old folkdancing friends in their 80's showed last year, so I would definitely <br/>
encourage anyone in reasonably good shape to go for that type of adventure, no matter <br/>
what their age!  <br/>
<br/>
What I would heartily discourage, however, is having anyone not in training even think <br/>
about  attempting to hike the entire canyon from South Rim to North RIm in less than half <br/>
a day as I did!  Even trying to do rim-river-rim in one full day on just the south side of the <br/>
canyon is severely frowned upon by the rangers, although I had done that many years ago <br/>
in less than 6 hours, but my getting to cross the entire canyon south to north, over 22 <br/>
miles with over 11,000 feet of elevation change in less than 10 hours, out of shape and on <br/>
a sprained ankle, certainly exceeded my expectations! All I can say is that it had been my <br/>
dream for almost 40 years, ever since I first saw the GC in my teens, and my past training <br/>
of backpacking 25 miles a day for months on end must have held me in good stead, even <br/>
though I haven't been able to do anything like that for years now!  That day it seems I just <br/>
happened to catch a "breeze", perhaps inspired by my old trail name, so thanks for your <br/>
congrats and for understanding just how special getting to do this was for me - truly a <br/>
one in a million opportunity and not something I'm advocating as a challenge for any other <br/>
letterboxers!<br/>
<br/>
As for the "old-timer" who was asking about walking around Meteor Crater, well... I guess <br/>
he really has been out of touch with things for quite a while, too! It's been over a dozen <br/>
years now that the Barrenger family has been leasing out interests to a private company to <br/>
charge for tours (currently $15 per person) that only allow you to go 1/4 mile away from <br/>
the visitor center!  Our particular tour guide told us that nowadays only once a year were <br/>
people with certain scientific backgrounds allowed to take the full hike around the crater, <br/>
so we felt especially privileged that not only did we get to do that, but we didn't even have <br/>
to pay the $30 fee - just because I had happened to ask the ranger at Sunset Crater about <br/>
the Flagstaff Science Festival a few days before and he had given me his very last science <br/>
fair passport! So, once in a while things just seem to work out, and no icy dementor's <br/>
breath can blow out the warm little joys that life occasionally throws our way!<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of icy conditions, yup - we're still out in them boxing away!  In fact, we <br/>
recently found over 100 boxes, all either buried under snow or needing to be pried out of <br/>
ice, in just 4 short afternoons in Berlin,CT, Portsmouth,NH, Gloucester/Lynn and <br/>
Sudbury,MA, including my 16,0000th find followed by a wonderful holiday late lunch <br/>
celebration at the historic Wayside Inn!  So, while folks in some parts of the country may <br/>
be fattening their counts with stamps from indoor games, gatherings, pub crawls and <br/>
such, we can assure all of you out there that we here in RI continue to work hard in the <br/>
traditional North American manner for most all of our finds, and that there is no "fudge" in <br/>
OUR counts! (Yes, we've made our lists, checked them twice, and definitely know who's <br/>
naughty or nice!:-) So, thanks for giving us such a good gentle chuckle over those <br/>
occasional "psychological underpinnings" we sometimes get to see, and a jolly "Ho, Ho, <br/>
Ho", Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, etc, to everyone out there in Letterboxland!<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
