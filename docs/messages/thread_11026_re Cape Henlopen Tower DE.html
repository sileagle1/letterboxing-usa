for:<br/>

Cape Henlopen Tower Letterbox<br/>
Placed on August 7, 2002, by Daphne's Family and Lizzy<br/>
Replaced December, 2002.<br/>
Cape Henlopen State Park, Delaware<br/>
Enter Cape Henlopen State Park and obtain a park map at the <br/>
entrance.  (Parking fees are $2.50 for in-state vehicles, $5.00 out-<br/>
of-state.)  Follow map to the Observation Tower.  Climb to the top of <br/>
the tower and, after enjoying the view, look south along the coast <br/>
toward twin towers in the direction of Rehoboth Beach.  Facing that <br/>
direction, look down to your left and locate the paved bike path that <br/>
appears to lead in that same direction.  Follow that path.  In a <br/>
short while, you will come to old railroad tracks embedded in the <br/>
path.  From these tracks, count 25 (adult) paces.  Directly to your <br/>
left, you will see a large, gnarly pine tree, the Guardian of the <br/>
Letterbox.  (If you come to a fork in the path, you have missed the <br/>
tracks.)  Search no higher than your head for the treasure it guards.<br/>
