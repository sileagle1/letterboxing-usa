You are very fortunate to live in New England. We have some of the biggest<br/>
gatherings going...often 100 or more people. CSCM and I have been unable to<br/>
attend most of them this year, but we have no fear, as there are a lot of<br/>
them....it just depends on how far you are willing to travel.<br/>
<br/>
The next MA event that I am aware of is the Great Cape Escape on Cape Cod on<br/>
Sept 30.<br/>
<br/>
You can check for events on Atlasquest (<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/events/).... Or you could host one of your<br/>
own..but I'd recommend attending one first as the exchange feeding frenzy is<br/>
a thing to behold.<br/>
