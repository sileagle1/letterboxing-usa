<br/>
"Falling Leaves" - No joy on this box.  Apparently there is no <br/>
'yellow building' at this time of year and the suspected hiding place <br/>
had a plug of ice in it making confirmation of the box impossible<br/>
<br/>
The Sweeney School" - Box is in good condition.<br/>
<br/>
"Camp Exploration Series" -<br/>
		 Huskies box - had ice in the box.  Baggy contents <br/>
were not affected by the ice.  The pencil, however, did not survive <br/>
the ice removal.<br/>
		Wildcat box - No joy.  The snow may be hiding it.<br/>
		DJJAAKS box - Ice logged.  The baggy contents were <br/>
semi frozen.  We did not bring the book home to dry out as we don't <br/>
plan to visit this area in the near future.<br/>
