<br/>
At the spring VA gather there were 4 event stamps and everyone liked <br/>
all of them.  Carve away and be not intimidated by finer work.  You <br/>
only get better by doing.<br/>

&gt; Mall sounds good.  Have seen it from within the Metro; don't think <br/>
I've <br/>
&gt; been in it.  Will drive from near IAD...<br/>

&gt;     Mall doesn't open until 10am, so don't show up too early!*<br/>

&gt; Didn't someone suggest "Icebreaker" as the title for the gather?  <br/>
If so, <br/>
&gt; a stamp showing the Potomac near DC in winter, with the ice <br/>
breaking, <br/>
&gt; would be apropos...  Maybe the Pentagon instead, since it's closer <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; the gather...  Pentagon with DC/Potomac scene in the middle...?   <br/>
I've <br/>
&gt; only carved two or three stamps ever, and this one should be better <br/>
than <br/>
&gt; my skills would allow.<br/>
