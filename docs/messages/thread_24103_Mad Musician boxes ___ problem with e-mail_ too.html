                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I attended the Holiday Survivors mini-meet (which was a blast, <br/>
BTW), and discovered that several people have e-mailed me about the <br/>
Violin stamp (I've not yet had a chance to check it ... I will!  I <br/>
promise!).  However, I've NOT recieved ANY e-mail about this one (yes, <br/>
flute and snare are missing ... but I might get snare back ... more on <br/>
that later).<br/>
<br/>
So ... if anyone has e-mailed me and I've not responded, it's because I <br/>
did NOT get your e-mail.  I hope no one felt slighted &amp;/or offended ;^)<br/>
<br/>
Choi?  Is this just a problem with my e-mail or set-up?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
