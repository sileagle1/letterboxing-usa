CT (New London county).<br/>
<br/>
Terrain: easy<br/>
Clues: easy<br/>
Time: about 1 and 1/2 hours<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS: Take Route 1 East through Groton, CT, turn<br/>
right onto Route 215. <br/>
After 0.6 mile, turn right onto Brook Street. After<br/>
0.5 mile, turn right onto Haley Farm Road, which<br/>
brings you to the parking lot of Haley Farm State<br/>
Park.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES: Entering the park, notice the main trail (a<br/>
wide gravelly path, marked with a green sign that says<br/>
"Bike Route") but instead turn to the right on a<br/>
smaller trail and pass through two stone walls with<br/>
fence posts. Bypass a turn to the left that would take<br/>
you through a third stone wall into a large field, and<br/>
instead go straight until you have a second<br/>
opportunity to turn left and pass through the stone<br/>
wall. This small faint path will take you to an old<br/>
cemetary with gravestones dating back to 1802. The<br/>
gravestones contain wonderful old poems, if you can<br/>
make them out (it's worth the effort!). Continuing<br/>
past the cemetary, curve left then right to find the<br/>
three-sided remains of a small foundation. Here you<br/>
will find the Chester Cemetary Letterbox, in a pile of<br/>
rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Backtrack about 8 paces to find a faint trail going<br/>
uphill. Follow this, cross over a small stone wall at<br/>
the top, and then bushwhack about 20 paces straight<br/>
ahead to get back onto the main trail. Turn left on<br/>
the trail and follow it until it comes out over flat<br/>
rock and then winds down into the upper end of the<br/>
large field that you passed on the way in. Follow the<br/>
trail across the upper section of the field and then<br/>
straight through a stone wall. Continue on this trail,<br/>
passing various other right and left junctions, until<br/>
it brings you down to the main bike route trail that<br/>
you saw when you first entered the park.<br/>
<br/>
Turn right on the main bike route trail, and follow it<br/>
to the end at a green iron gate. Pass by the gate and<br/>
turn left, to find the covered bridge over the<br/>
railroad tracks. Cross the bridge and follow the path,<br/>
through another green iron gate, past a junction on<br/>
the left, until you pass the City of Groton Utilities<br/>
equipment enclosure on the right. A short way after<br/>
this, turn left onto a trail and then immediately<br/>
leave the trail on the right to climb uphill through<br/>
trees and up rock, come out on flat rock, veer left to<br/>
a flat grassy spot (makes a good picnic spot). Cross<br/>
the grassy area to find more rock. Carefully climb off<br/>
the edge of the rock to find the Picnic Spot Letterbox<br/>
under the ledge.<br/>
<br/>
Return to the trail and turn right. Follow this trail<br/>
until you come to the railroad tracks and find a<br/>
tunnel under the tracks straight in front of you. Pass<br/>
through the tunnel. (Although the gate on the tunnel<br/>
entrance is usually open, if it should happen to be<br/>
locked, continue following the trail you are on, and<br/>
at the end turn right to get back to the covered<br/>
bridge.) Turn right when you come out of the tunnel<br/>
and follow the railroad fence for a short way until<br/>
you come to a trailhead on the left. Follow this trail<br/>
until you come to a junction on the right passing<br/>
through a stone wall. Take this trail and keep right<br/>
at the "Y" to arrive at a large rock known as Canopy<br/>
Rock. To your left is the main trail. Turn right onto<br/>
it, and follow it back to the parking lot.<br/>
