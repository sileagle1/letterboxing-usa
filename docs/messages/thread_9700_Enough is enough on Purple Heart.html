honesty if you really think about the people who have received the TRUE<br/>
purple heart for service to our country you will agree that such an honor<br/>
shouldn't be made light of. No one is trying to take this award away from<br/>
anyone,  let's keep it going, it is a great idea but personally I think the<br/>
broken compass or purple band-aid is more appropriate and a lot funnier too<br/>
which is kind of the idea behind this award!<br/>
I am sure when this was created the last thing on anyones mind was starting<br/>
this kind of a battle. As for the word ignorant being thrown out there,<br/>
quite frankly YES there have been a few ignorant statments posted but if we<br/>
look back at past battles that have shown up on this list those same people<br/>
are the ones who seems to love to add fuel to the fire battle after<br/>
battle!!! Let's take their statements for what they are move on and let it<br/>
go!<br/>
<br/>
This list should be used for posting new boxes, informing people of the<br/>
condition of their boxes, telling others of exceptional boxes, funny trail<br/>
stories and yes the occasional opinion! All this bickering is getting way<br/>
out of control!!! I am sick and tired of hitting the delete button over and<br/>
over to get all this craziness out of the way!!!! We have gone being a fun<br/>
little "Secret Society" to every other week having bickering match! THIS IS<br/>
A FUN HOBBY PLEASE LET'S KEEP THAT WAY!!!<br/>
