<br/>
Crocker is still in place, dry, and intact, and has received several <br/>
visitors.  Its namesake, however, is not so uncorrupted, having <br/>
collapsed in an ice storm this past fall.  We have heard that the <br/>
namesake will remain where it fell and will be allowed to decompose <br/>
naturally.  Correspondingly, the Crocker mystery box will also remain <br/>
in place.<br/>
<br/>
Two Hands may be missing, but we could not be sure because of <br/>
accumulated snow and ice.  We will return in the spring to be sure.  <br/>
In the meantime, we'd appreciate hearing from anyone who has found <br/>
this box.<br/>
<br/>
Clues for both boxes can still be found at:<br/>
http://www.quahog.org/cscm/where/letterboxes/crocker.html<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, we'd like to let everyone know that a hitchhiker has <br/>
been left with the Crocker mystery box.  Don't let it gather moss -- <br/>
go get it!<br/>
