                    <div class="plaintext-content">After a few conversations we had about the hobby when I was in her <br/>
store to purchase stamps and carving materials, and then the related <br/>
article in The RubberStamper Magazine, the owner of the local rubber <br/>
stamp store here in Muskegon (MI) was excited about letterboxing.  In <br/>
the most recent issue of her monthly newsletter, which goes out via <br/>
US mail to her customers, she included an article about letterboxing <br/>
and to get people acquainted with it, she hid a letterbox containing <br/>
store coupons on her property and included a short poetic clue to the <br/>
box in the newsletter.  She is considering doing a class about <br/>
letterboxing and stamp carving if there is sufficient interest.  The <br/>
newletter article directed people to the letterboxing.org website for <br/>
more information.<br/>
<br/>
The newsletter came out the end of this past week.  Since that time I <br/>
have noticed a significant increase in traffic at my web site coming <br/>
from the LbNA site (clues to my boxes are on my own web site, linked <br/>
from the LbNA site), so I am assuming her article generated some <br/>
interest among people in this area.<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping that over the weekend, more people would get around to <br/>
reading their newsletter and checking out the web site.  Based on the <br/>
posts coming across here this weekend, I am actually hoping that not <br/>
many of them found their way to this dicussion group.  Sure would <br/>
hate to give a bad impression from the get-go and leave people <br/>
wondering if this really is not a very nice group of people to become <br/>
involved with.<br/>
<br/>
I have been hanging around here for a couple of months now, and I <br/>
realize that it is only a few, and the opinions and behavior are not <br/>
representative of the majority, but if I happened to just start <br/>
reading the group for the first time this weekend, I would certainly <br/>
think twice before participating.  Not to mention, I would be very <br/>
hesitant about trying my hand at stamp carving and placing it out in <br/>
a box, exposed and ready for critique.<br/>

</p><p>Don't let the turkey's get you down. This is an aberration. We are mostly very nice, helpful people. Most of our "debates" are done with sensitivity and intelligence. Once in a while some of us, myself included, get into a "mood."  At the risk of using another cliche, this too shall pass. And another....Stay tuned. (Three cliches in one short paragraph..that's bad.....have to remove cobwebs from cranium.) 
</p><p>Too bad you are not closer to CT. You could come to our Kid's Day gathering in October and see for yourself what fun letterboxing is and get to know the wonderful people who are involved in it.
