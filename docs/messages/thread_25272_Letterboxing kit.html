1. I heard about letterboxing via my daughter seeing it written up in a<br/>
home-schooling publication she was cataloging in her job as a librarian; had<br/>
I seen it myself I would have pursued it. One CAUTION is that if you get an<br/>
article or an interview into media that people local to you will see, you<br/>
absolutely have to make it clear to the interviewer/journalist some key<br/>
points of letterboxing such as hiding boxes well after you've accessed them;<br/>
the difference between LB and geocaching, the main difference being the<br/>
art-work of a hand-carved stamp; and anything else you think a newbie should<br/>
know (not all of them will read the etiquette and will not be good<br/>
letterboxers, but that's a risk you take, and you can always educate them<br/>
sometime down the road if they're doing something that isn't good like<br/>
leaving boxes in plain sight, etc. <br/>
2. A new local letterboxer was introduced by his brother giving him a<br/>
letterboxing "kit" - don't know what that is, but this person has really<br/>
joined in and is doing a great job with good clues, good carvings, hiding<br/>
well, etc.<br/>
3. Another new local letterboxing family stumbled across a letterbox that<br/>
was soaked, took it home, read about it via the insert that was inside the<br/>
box, and then were hooked, and they are also a wonderful addition to my own<br/>
local letterboxing community. <br/>
4. A long-time boxer in my community is getting his church involved, and of<br/>
course in that process he is obviously educating them as to the etiquette<br/>
along the way. This probably falls under telling your friends/relatives.<br/>
<br/>
So my suggestions are making sure your boxes have info pointing to both LBNA<br/>
and AQ, telling your friends/relatives and maybe going further than that by<br/>
giving them a little kit to get them started, and possibly getting an<br/>
article into some local media, although that last one will be debated by<br/>
others as being a good idea or not. Probably depends how desperate you are<br/>
for more boxers in your area!<br/>

=================================================<br/>
<br/>
- At least one ink pad, preferably more, and/or markers <br/>
<br/>
- A compass. <br/>
<br/>
- Letterboxing book by Randy Hall or some of the general info pamphlets<br/>
created by other individuals.  Look in the Files section of this message<br/>
board and check out the Useful Info folder to find some of this.  <br/>
<br/>
- You may also want to consider some of the things listed in the "What's in<br/>
your kit?" file.<br/>
