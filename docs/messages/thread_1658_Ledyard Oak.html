Jay,<br/>
    Thanks for the 3 new letterboxes at the Leyard Oak.  We went out today<br/>
in 18 degrees and found them.  I never knew there were hiking trails there.<br/>
It was a nice little walk, perfect for getting out in the fresh air for a<br/>
little while.  We were the second visitors to find all three boxes!  Keep up<br/>
the great work, can't wait to see the state's largest sycamore.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Melissa! We didn't know there were any trails there either. <br/>
We've been meaning to go see (and box) the Ledyard Oak for quite <br/>
awhile, and were delighted to find a trail system just waiting for <br/>
us. So we planted the box we had ready and then scurried back to the <br/>
workbench to carve a couple more. BL (Before Letterboxing) we used to <br/>
hike the same 3 or 4 trails over and over again. Now we're starting <br/>
to feel like real local trail experts!<br/>
<br/>
I just love the Joshua's Tract trailguide. We got our copy at the <br/>
library (if your local library doesn't have one, they'll be glad to <br/>
get you an inter-library loan). We just ran it through the <br/>
photocopier, which was a piece of cake since it's so short. I've seen <br/>
it in the CT Dept of Environmental Management catalog at <br/>
http://www.dep.state.ct.us/ <br/>
which also is where we got our guide to CT's "notable trees."<br/>

We can't wait to try out our new snowshoes!  Thought we would have to head<br/>
up north to use them.  But maybe not!!!<br/>
