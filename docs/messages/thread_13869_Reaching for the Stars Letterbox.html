found it last year, I believe it was late summer (I don't have my log <br/>
book with me or I could be more precise). It was definitely not easy <br/>
to find, and I actually had trouble even finding the park itself. But <br/>
it is one of my favorite stamps--- I had no idea until I got there <br/>
what the title referred to. It really touched my heart ( I'm afraid <br/>
to be more specific because I might unintentionally be posting a <br/>
spoiler). Anyway, it is well worth another try! If things are the <br/>
same as when I visited, you will not find the stump itself without a <br/>
thorough search--don't give up. Happy boxing, Salamander. <br/>
