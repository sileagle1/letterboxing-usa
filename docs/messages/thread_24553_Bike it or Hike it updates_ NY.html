4 new Letterboxes from my NY trip. All 4 new boxes are in the Albany<br/>

clues for a few others. Check out the Bike it or Hike Update Page at<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/haalck@snet.net/update_page.htm  for more<br/>
info. I also wanted to send out a big THANK YOU to the many fellow<br/>
boxers who have replaced logbooks for some of my more distant boxes.<br/>
It really helps when you have over 100 boxes planted and your trying<br/>
to keep them all active. It makes it easy for me to just send out a<br/>
new log or stamp to someone living in the area or about to visit my<br/>
box. I've met some great people over the years through boxing.<br/>
