                    <div class="plaintext-content">Webmaster, please revise Great Grape Trail letterbox (the third box <br/>
of the Mansfield Depot series listed in Mansfield Center, Tolland <br/>
County CT) as follows:  Remove the following paragraph -  Just beyond <br/>
on the left there is a cluster of trees. Most of the trees are alive, <br/>
you will find what you are looking for in the dead one! Nearby is a <br/>
grapevine for which the box is named!  <br/>
Please replace with:<br/>
<br/>
Almost as soon as you see the field on the right you will see a pile <br/>
of stones removed from the field by workers.  Behind the pile of <br/>
stones is a tree, behind the tree you will find the letterbox covered <br/>
by leaves, sticks and bark.  On the opposite side of the trail are <br/>
the grapevines the box was named for. <br/>

Thanks a Bunch!<br/>
