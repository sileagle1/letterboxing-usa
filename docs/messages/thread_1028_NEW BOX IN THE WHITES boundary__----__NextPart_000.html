<br/>
I got back last night from three days in the Whites with my daughter <br/>
Anne (12) and son David (10).<br/>
<br/>
It was just about 100% humidity all three days. Never any serious <br/>
rain, but visibility of only 100-200 feet. I loved it. Giant fields <br/>
of boulders and sedge, with cairns leading off in all directions like <br/>
menhirs, and the mist swirling all around. Like "Fog on the Barrow <br/>
Downs.' We stayed in the AMC huts - Mizpah the first night and Lake <br/>
the second. We went up the Crawford Path - the oldest maintained <br/>
hiking path in the USA, and down Lion Head to Pinkham Notch.<br/>
<br/>
The original plan had been to come down Tuckerman Ravine and look for <br/>
your letterbox there. Alas, the trail and the bowl are closed on <br/>
week-days, we discovered, for serious trail work. I hiked back up to <br/>
the Hermit Lake shelters from the trail junction when we got down <br/>
from Lion Head, hoping that the box might be around the shelters. But <br/>
I could tell from the compass bearings once I got there that the box <br/>
was going to be up in the bowl closer to the headwall. And the trail <br/>
was closed off from the shelters on up. Another time.<br/>
<br/>
This trail work will be over by August 11, so no point putting a note <br/>
on the clue page.<br/>
<br/>
I added this box to the AT series, along with the southern AT boxes <br/>
that have been placed this spring. You can get there from Marty's Web <br/>
Ring, or go directly to<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/series.html#at<br/>
<br/>
Strictly speaking, Tuckerman's is not on the AT, which passes by the <br/>
Ravine 1000 feet higher up. But it seemed close ehough to me to <br/>
count. What do others think?<br/>

I am sorry for you to lose Sarah, but absolutely delighted for<br/>
Susan, Erik, and myself - plus the impetus she will give to<br/>
letterboxing in Vermont overall.<br/>
