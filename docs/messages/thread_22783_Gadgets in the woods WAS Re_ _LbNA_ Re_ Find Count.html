                    <div class="plaintext-content">hehehe.  Tonight I saw a very brief news story about cell towers in our<br/>
National Parks ... and now we have a controversy.  I didn't get the full<br/>
story and I will be looking into this later, but the gist was we have a<br/>
problem of cell phones ringing in National Parks.  Those in the know,<br/>
please enlighten us.  Is it a problem because we didn't have a national<br/>
policy in place prohibiting cell towers and some parks permitted them? <br/>
It's okay for some of the parks to have towers, but not all parks?  I<br/>
guess you cannot ban phone usage in the parks when you have a tower in the<br/>
same location.  The media reported the defense that "if it saves one life,<br/>
then we should allow them."  I wasn't impressed with the example of the<br/>
life saved; a skier chose to be in an "off-limits" area and severely<br/>
injured himself.  Without the cell phone he said he would not have been so<br/>
lucky.  I would have more compassion for someone who was not breaking the<br/>
law and needed immediate assistance.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I was shaking my head in disbelief that this was newsworthy today.<br/>
 National Parks would have been one of my top picks where I wouldn't<br/>
expect to hear the obnoxious ring tones.<br/>
<br/>
I just have one final word on appropriate cell usage in National Parks and<br/>
other public places...vibrate.<br/>

&gt; Wow  I have an idea!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Why dont we all purchase one of those hand held devices that the<br/>
&gt; grocery stores use to keep inventory  you know, the ones that scan the<br/>
&gt; products on the shelves? Then we can have all placers paste UPC codes on<br/>
&gt; the bottom of each of their letterboxes. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; When were walking in the woods, all we have to do is wave that<br/>
&gt; electronic magic wand in the area we THINK the letterbox is hidden and<br/>
&gt; it will automatically find it for us AND record the find in a letterbox<br/>
&gt; in a specially devised software program sold by Letterboxing.org. We<br/>
&gt; won't even get our hands dirty or have to deal with yuckky snakes or<br/>
&gt; worry about closing the containers or zip lock bags. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just wave and go!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Great idea?<br/>

Well you had better not depend on a cell phone to help you if you get <br/>
lost/hurt  in the Adirondacks. It amazes me to see how many people <br/>
think they can get a good signal if they get in trouble and need help.<br/>
My ranger friends call cell phones  "job security."  LOL<br/>
