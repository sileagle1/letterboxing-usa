thank all of you .!  It was great fun and Alan made our most wonderful <br/>
Event Stamp once again. Thanks Alan, and he gifted the stamp to me. !! I <br/>
have  the one he made for us last year too. and now have this great idea <br/>
brewing, Stay Tuned.!<br/>
The most fun I had today, was riding around on my bike to make sure no <br/>
one got lost , or needed help, and I kept seeing people walking with the <br/>
orange sheets tight in their hands and big grins on their faces.  Joy <br/>
everywhere .<br/>
Congrates to those who made 100 today at kids day. What could be better <br/>
than that ?<br/>
This wonderful day would never have happened without all  the enjoyable <br/>
effort  put forth by Bluebird., Alfair , Lobsta ,The Gal Pals, and <br/>
Angel.  We all had a blast . Thanks for coming.<br/>
Happy boxing.<br/>
