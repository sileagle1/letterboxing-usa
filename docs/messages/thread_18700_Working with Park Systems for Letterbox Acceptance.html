I've gotten a lot of cooperation with library staff to do the same thing, but with letterbooks, and with historical societies for their (our) landmarks.  Mentioning scouting groups' enjoyment and education seems to help, too.<br/>

I'm assuming (correctly I hope) that by SF you meant San Francisco, <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have had wonderful luck with park managers.  These are nature <br/>
centers, nature preserves, town, and state parks in Connecticut.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly I have worked with nature centers that I am a member of, and <br/>
have attended their programs over the years.  They know me well.  <br/>
One held an introduction to letterboxing course, and we planted five <br/>
boxes in the park.  Another is doing the planting themselves, and <br/>
writing the clues to teach the educational mission.  The State of <br/>
Connecticut planted boxes in their 30 state forests, with forestry <br/>
education in the clues. (See Connecticut boxes starting with "DEP".)<br/>
<br/>
The closer the management is to the park or preserve, the better the <br/>
relationship with letterboxing will be.  An on-site nature center is <br/>
a good place to start.  Avoid National parks at all costs.  They may <br/>
pull their head out of the sand, but not anytime soon.<br/>
