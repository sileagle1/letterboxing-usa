                    <div class="plaintext-content">After traveling so much of the country last month and finding so <br/>
many single letterboxes and series of boxes hidden in various <br/>
places, I am curious how you all plan your new boxes.  Some of us <br/>
are just starting out with planning and planting and would love to <br/>
hear about your methods, be you an occasional planter or a nearly <br/>
compulsive one!<br/>
<br/>
Do you locate possible sites then determine the box and clues to fit <br/>
the location?<br/>
<br/>
Do you get an idea for a great stamp then find a place to put it?<br/>
<br/>
Do you carry fully prepared boxes with you and place them in "the <br/>
perfect place" when you find it?<br/>
<br/>
Do you decide on a series of boxes, carve them, then look for an <br/>
area in which to plant them?  <br/>
<br/>
I know you all have different modus operandi for planning and <br/>
planting.  Won't you share with us, please?<br/>

Sometimes I find a certain park and I think that it deserves to have <br/>
a letterbox. Or perhaps I was walking along and I see the perfect <br/>
stump/log combo that would make a great hiding place and there is a <br/>
wonderful rock formation nearby that would fit perfectly into a <br/>
clue...Inspiration!<br/>
So I go home and I carve a frog, because the rock formation looks <br/>
like a frog and I make sure I have a plastic container that will fit <br/>
into my stump/log hiding place and there you have it! A letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do you locate possible sites then determine the box and clues to <br/>
fit <br/>
&gt; the location?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the name of the Park or the trail will just scream out for <br/>
a letterbox. Waterfalls and Lighthouses are also locations that seem <br/>
to want a box!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you get an idea for a great stamp then find a place to put it?<br/>
<br/>
Once I had a terrific idea for stamp that had the image of the Moon <br/>
and a River. A Moon River stamp, so I carved it and I carried it <br/>
around for months until I found a place to hide it. (along a river of <br/>
course!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you carry fully prepared boxes with you and place them in "the <br/>
&gt; perfect place" when you find it?<br/>
<br/>
Yes! I still have a lovely Sheep stamp that is all together in a <br/>
letterbox and I have not found a spot to hide it yet!! I also have a <br/>
Florida box that I am going to hide in the Tampa area once hurricane <br/>
season is over!! :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you decide on a series of boxes, carve them, then look for an <br/>
&gt; area in which to plant them?  <br/>
<br/>
Absolutely! I have a series of 5 Nancy Drew themed stamps that are <br/>
still looking for a hiding place. I just have not found the perfect <br/>
park for them yet!  When I knew I was going to visit the Southwestern <br/>
US, I carved a series of 3 stamps depicting stereotypical <br/>
Southwestern items--A String of Chilis, A Concha Belt and an Adobe <br/>
house and I hid them while I was visiting the area. Some folks wait <br/>
til they come home to plant such series. A local Pacific Northwest <br/>
letterboxer hid a Mexico series in Oregon!<br/>
