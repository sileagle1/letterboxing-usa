Bent Tree Boxes<br/>
    "Bent Tree Boxes" reside in Loriella Park, which is located on <br/>
Leavells Rd. in Spotsylvania County, near Fredericksburg. From I 95 <br/>
take Exit 130 B for Rt. 3 West, Culpeper. On exit ramp, get into left <br/>
lane. Be aware. This area can get congested with Rt. 3 traffic <br/>
shifting lanes to the right  to get into Central Park, while you are <br/>
trying to move left to get onto Rt. 3.<br/>
     On Rt. 3 go to the 6th light (Salem Church Rd.) and turn left.  <br/>
This road will lead you to the park. After the 3rd light on Salem <br/>
Church Rd.(CVS on corner) the road becomes  Leavells Rd. Continue <br/>
straight. After passing two schools on your right, the park will <br/>
appear down the road on the right. Turn into the park and follow the <br/>
road back to its end. Park in the swimming pool parking lot. <br/>
<br/>
Bent Tree Box #1<br/>
    From the parking lot by the pool, go out onto the road and look <br/>
for a white message board (to the west) located at the first tee of <br/>
the disc golf course. At the board you will be near the edge of the <br/>
woods. There is a path running along the tree line. Head down the <br/>
path SW. Follow the path as it curves around and goes by a fenced-in <br/>
graveyard. Not far past the graveyard, the path forks. Go straight <br/>
into the field. You will no longer be following the tree line.<br/>
     Stop at the spot where there are two white rocks that are the <br/>
tee of Hole #5 on your right. Sight 180 degrees with your compass. <br/>
This will give you the direction where you will enter the woods. You <br/>
can't see the opening because of a rise. Head in that direction. If <br/>
there are disc golfers playing in the area, be careful. You may need <br/>
to go over to the tree line close to the basket for Hole #4 and <br/>
follow it to the opening instead of cutting  across the field. <br/>
     Look for a trail opening in the woods with a small wooden fence <br/>
on the right. The basket for Hole #6 is usually close by. (Sometimes <br/>
the baskets get moved to different positions.)<br/>
     Follow the trail over a wooden stump walkway and pallet bridge. <br/>
You will come to a  trail intersection at the point where you can see <br/>
a stump on the left, a bench on the right, and two white rocks <br/>
straight ahead. Turn left . Follow the trail uphill until another <br/>
trail comes in from the right. Turn right on that trail. Follow that <br/>
trail until it comes out to an open area. There will be a holly tree <br/>
on your right and a large smooth-barked tree with a white symbol <br/>
painted on it to your left. You will be in the area of basket #10. <br/>
Watch out for flying discs. <br/>
     Go up a slight incline in line with the painted tree 20 degrees <br/>
until you come to a path. Go right on the path. Stay on this path. It <br/>
will start to go uphill. As you go uphill, on the right hand side of <br/>
the path you will pass one tree with a "K" painted on it  and another <br/>
tree with a face painted on it. Not long after, you will get to a <br/>
spot where the path curves right, and there is a large tree on your <br/>
right (at the curve) and a group of three trees on your left.<br/>
     With your back against the large tree on the right, look 15 <br/>
degrees and notice a tree bent at an odd angle. Walk to the tree. <br/>
Look for another tree at 330 degrees that is large and <br/>
straight. "Bent Tree #1" is at the base of that tree.<br/>
<br/>
Bent Tree #2<br/>
     After finding "Bent Tree #1" return to the path and continue on. <br/>
The path will eventually curve left at a spot where another path <br/>
comes in from the right. Keep to the left.  When you come to a T <br/>
intersection, go left. There should be a green painted trail marker <br/>
pole at the intersection.<br/>
     Follow the path down hill until you get to a large pine tree on <br/>
the right side of the path. 24 steps from the pine tree should put <br/>
you in a spot where if you look to the right, you will see a large <br/>
tree and a skinny tree of different species that appear to be growing <br/>
out of the same trunk. Behind this oddity is a tree that is bent <br/>
about 30 ft. up with a rotting log beside it.  "Bent Tree #2" is at <br/>
its base.<br/>
     To get back to your car, follow the path back up the hill. Keep <br/>
straight past the green  trail marker pole, and you will come out by <br/>
another graveyard. You will see tennis courts to your left. Exit the <br/>
woods to the left. You can either go through the tennis court parking <br/>
lot to the paved road and follow it back to your car, or you can cut <br/>
across the fields. You can use the white house, which is across the <br/>
road from the swimming pool, as a guide.<br/>
