<br/>
Binx and I picked up a couple quick boxes on Saturday morning before <br/>
other obligations called us away. Both in fine condition:<br/>
<br/>
-Haunted Trail<br/>
-Broad Meadow Brook<br/>
<br/>
We spent a glorious sunny day yesterday driving along the north <br/>
shore, inhaling the healing salt air, and nabbing boxes along the <br/>
way. Boxes listed are in good condition unless otherwise stated:<br/>
<br/>
-Breakheart Reservation (someone's dog used the immediate vicinity <br/>
for a rest stop so watch where you step/sit!)<br/>
-Kokopelli's Flute (this box had been destroyed apparently but <br/>
partially rebuilt by Rustypuff(?). The log and inkpad are gone but <br/>
the (nice) stamp was there...go figure. We'll attempt to email the <br/>
placers.)<br/>
-Marblehead Rail Trail<br/>
-Bridget Bishop<br/>
-Castle of Love<br/>
-Bullfrog Pond<br/>
-Shooting Star<br/>
-Young's Great Rock/Wigwam Point Light<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who placed these boxes! We also attempted to find the <br/>
Eastern Point Lighthouse box in Gloucester with no luck. Other folks <br/>
mentioned having similar unsuccessful attempts in nearby log book <br/>
entries. Can anybody verify if this box is indeed intact? Beautiful <br/>
shoreline walk though.<br/>
<br/>
We are absolutely loving this hobby ...we have F80 after our first <br/>
two months...planning to break 100 this coming weekend while camping <br/>
in central MA. What a blast!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails (we hope...no exchanges yet!),<br/>
<br/>
