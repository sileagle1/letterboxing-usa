the blind and weeds twice my height on the other side.  No <br/>
bushwacking to that box!!  Needeeps, there are now 2 duck blinds at <br/>
this spot.  A couple who was hiking there directed me to the older <br/>
blind, where I assume your box lies lurking.  I also stopped to <br/>
find "Miss Molly".  This lovely tribute letterbox placed by MommaFox <br/>
definately deserves a viist. <br/>

other side of road, finally figured out I had parked right next to <br/>
the proper starting point for Jumble, DUH!! To add insult to injury, <br/>
I passed by the Table Rock/Camera letterbox placed by Teach and <br/>

&gt;Hello, for the Duck blind, there is no need to bushwack simply stand in front of the old duck blind,facing it, go to the left corner and on the side of the blind there is a board on the ground and the box is under it.I was just there last week checking on it,because someone told me that there was a new blind and I wanted to see it.Lenny<br/>

return to finish it ASAP. Hey maybe we should meet up and do it together?<br/>
