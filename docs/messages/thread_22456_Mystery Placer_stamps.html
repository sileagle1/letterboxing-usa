I've been wanting to jump in with some info here but had been waiting <br/>
until I could actually go out to check on my box "The Shell Game". I <br/>
intend to tomorrow so may have more info then but I wanted to try to <br/>
help correct some mistaken info. This was my first box and I was <br/>
excited about the place we found and the whole theme, etc. but I hadn't <br/>
learned anything about carving yet and didn't think I'd be talented at <br/>
it at all since I am not artistic so I put a note in the box and <br/>
possibly in the clue (I don't recall for sure at the moment) explaining <br/>
that I was sorry it was a store bought stamp but I was excited to get <br/>
one out there. I ended up emailing with a couple of local boxers who's <br/>
boxes I'd found and one or both of them offered advice and to get <br/>
together to help with carving, or even do one for me I believe but we <br/>
haven't been able to coordinate yet. Anyway, one of the 1st finders did <br/>
leave the comment "pity" it's not a carved stamp which did make me a <br/>
bit sad but I know who and understand and will eventually get one in <br/>
there. I have checked the box since then so I know the mystery stamp <br/>
wasn't left when the comment was. She may have left it there later <br/>
trying to help me or it could be someone else. The other mistake is <br/>
that the other boxes that were also contributed to - "Madegascar" I <br/>
believe are not mine but Val's. At this point since I haven't seen what <br/>
was written and don't know the intention - I am not upset and love the <br/>
fun of boxing - it may just be a new twist. Doubt I would let it bother <br/>
me much even if they were being snobbish or whatever - I've got more <br/>
important stuff to stress about.<br/>
I also see planting boxes as a donation - giving back - giving others <br/>
who enjoy the same hobby as I some fun - more hunting options!  I kind <br/>
of enjoy carving and collecting the stamps but I really love the <br/>
cleverness of making clues/theme and deciphering/following clues. <br/>
Getting out, finding new wonderful places and exercising are great too.<br/>
Anyway, thanks everyone for all those boxes to hunt - my 7 yr. old son <br/>
Bat Boy and I are having a great time!<br/>
