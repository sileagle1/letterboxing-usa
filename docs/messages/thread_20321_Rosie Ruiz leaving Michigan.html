West Michigan on 9/4/04.  I had a hunch that is where you'd leave <br/>
her Wes!  I'm amazed you were able to follow those botched up clues <br/>
and find the box which wasn't even where it was supposed to be!<br/>
<br/>
Rosie wined and dined with us and a few fellow MI &amp; WI 'boxers over <br/>
the holiday weekend and then went to hang out at the Summer Vacation <br/>
Mystery Box.  She was picked up this past weekend by Sarbear, who <br/>
will be jetting her off to eastern lands later this week.<br/>
