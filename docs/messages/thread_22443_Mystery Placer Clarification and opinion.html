&gt; &gt; hand carved stamp."<br/>
<br/>
I have found the boxes in question. The comment above was not <br/>
necessarily written by the Mystery Placer. As I recall, the comment <br/>
was not written on the page where the Mystery Placer stamed the <br/>
image in. Instead it was written on the page of a regular boxer. <br/>
Perhaps that boxer is also the Mystery Placer, but no one (well <br/>
almost no one) can know for sure. Heck, for all we know, Val (the <br/>
box placer) could even be the Mystery Placer. Wouldn't that be <br/>
funny? <br/>
<br/>
The Mystery Placer stamps are in their own baggie, the boxes are <br/>
plenty big enough to hold the stamp, and the stamp is clearly marked <br/>
as an addition to the box.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed finding these stamps. I have the original image and the <br/>
Mystery Placer images side by side in my log. Letterboxing has a <br/>
fine tradition of adding things to boxes like hitchhikers, cuckoo <br/>
clues, and bonus box clues. Yes, these Mystery Placer stamps may be <br/>
of a bit more permanent nature, and yes it is somewhat presumptous <br/>
to add a stamp to an existing box, but I see the fun as immensely <br/>
outweighing any badness. I would much rather someone add something <br/>
to one of my boxes than to repack or rehide it poorly.<br/>
