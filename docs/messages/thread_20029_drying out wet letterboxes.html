                    <div class="plaintext-content">About drying out letterbox contents-- I've thought about saving those little desiccant packets that come with certain things you buy, to keep in my letterboxing backpack and put in damp letterboxes I find.  I remember seeing a post about this awhile ago too.  Has anyone had a negative experience with this?  I wouldn't want to do it if it's going to upset anyone or be somehow harmful to a letterbox or its contents. Another thing to re-emphasize, even though it's been stated plenty of times before, is to pack or re-pack contents in FREEZER bags, or some kind of thicker bag.  They are much more likely to hold up than the regular thin zip-locks.  And also -- the bags with the little zipper-pull don't seem to keep out water as well and are also prone to damage or having broken "zippers".  I also think when I place a box I will avoid the typical Rubbermaid or similar boxes, because I've seen over half my finds (every one of them Rubbermaid type or similar) chewed into by an animal, and I think a harder, thicker plastic would be more of a deterrent to those teeth.  As soon as they are chewed into, they leak.  Also, their lids come off too easily as opposed to a screw-on or some other types of lids.   --lunaryakketyact<br/>
