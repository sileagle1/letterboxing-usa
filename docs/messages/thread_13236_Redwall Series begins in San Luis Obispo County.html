letterboxes around the county based on Brian Jacques's series of <br/>
rodent fiction, Redwall.  The first in the series, clues posted on <br/>

different character in the series, and plant one box a month.  Since <br/>
there are literally hundreds of characters in the books, I could go <br/>
on for years.<br/>

Redwall on CD tonight.  We had also been boxing earlier.  We all had <br/>
the same idea - what a great theme for a series of boxes!<br/>

Now I have a question.  I'm in Virginia - would it be a breach of <br/>

In fact, the books seem to be SO suited to letterboxing, (and just <br/>
kind of the right tone to attract the same people who are attracted <br/>
to letterboxing, you know?)  that I was surprised to run a search and <br/>
NOT find that there were already lots of boxes with a Redwall theme <br/>
planted all over the place...<br/>
<br/>
I hope you folks do plant some too, and I hope I can travel to <br/>
Virginia some day and find them!  I think if I get around to carving <br/>
a Redwall-themed hitchhiker, I will mail it to  you instead of <br/>
planting it around here...<br/>
<br/>
I like Basil, too- I just wouldn't want to have to feed him.<br/>

You folks down in LA or up in SF, do stop by and collect these <br/>
