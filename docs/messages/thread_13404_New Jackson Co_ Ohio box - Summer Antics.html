Difficulty: Easy<br/>
Terrain: Moderate (It's in a hilly cemetery.)<br/>
<br/>
This little fellow is hiding in a microbox (please bring a stamp pad <br/>
and pencil) in Fairmont Cemetery in Jackson, Ohio.  The cemetery is <br/>
located off East Broadway in Jackson.  To get there, take the <br/>
Broadway exit off US Route #35 and turn west (toward town) on <br/>
Broadway.  The cemetery entrance is about  mile on your right.<br/>
<br/>
To find "Summer Antics", make your way to the highest point in the <br/>
cemetery.  There you will find a crumbling monument with a large <br/>
plaque containing the Gettysburg Address.  From behind this monument, <br/>
take a bearing of 110 and proceed about 33 paces to large, recently <br/>
cut, stump.  (1 pace = 2 steps but because of the terrain and the <br/>
need to be respectful of the graves the pace count is approximate at <br/>
best here)  From the stump, take a bearing of 155 and go about 64 <br/>
paces to a cedar tree.  If you look closely about 6 feet off the <br/>
ground, you should find our little friend waiting for you!<br/>
<br/>
