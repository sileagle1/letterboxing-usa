at just about any park ranger station . . . but <br/>
I personally just don't find those, say, user-friendly <br/>
(too informative = too overwhelming for me) . . .<br/>
<br/>
Come on, anyone out there have a favorite?<br/>

912550-01-5) in the 70's when I had to do the dreaded leaf <br/>
collection in school.  I have had it ever since and it is very easy <br/>
to use, then it cost me $2.00.  I recently purchased a "companion <br/>
guide" called "Winter Tree Finder" (ISBN 0-912550-03-1)for 3.50 at a <br/>
National Park bookstore. Author is May Theigaard Watts.  <br/>
<br/>
These books are very logically put together.  Page one starts like:<br/>
If the tree has needles start with this symbol, on this page<br/>
If the tree has leaves, start with this symbol, on page 14.<br/>
<br/>
It gives you these easy choices throughout the book.  It is very <br/>
easy to identify a tree - correctly.  These books are about 4 x 6 <br/>
(using the handy ruler on the back) and about 60 pages.  <br/>
Illustrations are two colored and include maps.<br/>

Hope you can find these!<br/>

Funny about the "dreaded leaf collection at school"-- I always liked that .<br/>
. .<br/>
<br/>
It would be kindof neat to somehow incorporate clues from a book<br/>
that most boxers would have--<br/>
