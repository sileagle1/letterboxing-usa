<p><tt>&gt; While I'm on the subject, has anyone else found a HH that had it's <br/>own <br/>&gt; traveling box?<br/><br/>The Backpacker HH is in its own Rubbermaid sandwich box -- makes <br/>hiding it a little difficult because you have to put it in a location <br/>large enough for two boxes!<br/><br/>Ruthann<br/>aka Mirkwood<br/><br/></tt><br/></p>

Thanks for all of the feedback on this one. When my family went to Maine on vacation at the end of last month, I had carved a stamp to plant while we were there letterboxing. Then, on the day we went out to box, my wife got injured, and we had to cut the day short. We ended up taking the fully prepared box back home with us. So I was thinking of turning it into a HH instead, and wondered if I should send it off with it's own box or not. We've found three HH so far, one had it's own container, the others did not.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've found 3 HHs so far, 2 had their own boxes and 1 was just in a <br/>
ziploc bag.  Now I should mention this too, one was a beautiful <br/>
professionally made stamp with a really nice stamp pad of its own--<br/>
the owner/creator really put a lot of $$ and thought into it--it was <br/>
really neat and our first HH experience!  The other had a miniature <br/>
(although dried out) stamp pad of its own and a really neat &amp; <br/>
intricately carved stamp (this one had been on the road for a LONG <br/>
time as evidenced in the entries in the log).  The third HH was <br/>
absolutely adorable and had a cute little handmade notepad/logbook <br/>
included with it.  That provided me with a lot of neat little ideas <br/>
for other possible letterbox materials...<br/>
    We recently set out a HH and made it a 'microbox'--it still has <br/>
a box of its own but it's much easier to co-locate with a larger <br/>
box.  You also use discretion when you leave it at a hiding spot--if <br/>
it's visible when you try to hide it, then just wait to leave it at <br/>
another letterbox site.<br/>
