<br/>
The good news.  After being alerted by Wild Rose that the 1st Annual <br/>
Thanksgiving Letterbox in Olympia, WA was soaked and needed attention, <br/>
we have completely revamped it.  New box, new bags, new logbook, and <br/>
most importantly a new stamp!  Now all of you who have found this box <br/>
already will have an excuse to go visit it again.  The only thing that <br/>
isn't new is the location.<br/>
<br/>
The bad news.  The 2nd Annual Thanksgiving Letterbox in Lake Oswego, OR <br/>
is missing.  We intend to replace it, but don't know yet when that will <br/>
happen.  We have updated the LbNA website with the current status, and <br/>
will send another message out when it is back in business.<br/>
