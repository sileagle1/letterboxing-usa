Great Smoky Mountains National Park<br/>
Planted 11-9-2000<br/>

This box was somewhat of an afterthought and consequently I screwed <br/>
up a couple of things. I had some postcards with me which I put in <br/>
the box to be stamped and mailed to me if you would. However, I <br/>
failed to bring a logbook for the box, so if the first person to find <br/>
it wouldn't mind placing a cheap small logbook in there, I would <br/>
greatly appreciate it and certainly be willing to pay you back the <br/>
dollar or so one might cost a Wallmart. Secondly, I was _really_ <br/>
pressed for time due to it approaching darkness by the time I got to <br/>
the falls, and I did not relish the thought of trying to hike out of <br/>
there at night. Consequently, I rushed too much was not satisfied <br/>
with the stamp I carved and will likely replace it next time I am in <br/>
the area (hopefully in the spring). Now if you are still interested <br/>
in finding it, I have one more caveat.  I would allow at least 3 <br/>
hours (I did it in a little over 2 due to concerns about darkness- <br/>
but not easily). This hike is over 5 miles roundtrip and goes along <br/>
some rather dangerous cliffs at times. While the trail is wide enough <br/>
this should not be a problem, it is rocky and easy to trip if one <br/>
were not paying attention. I personally would not suggest it for <br/>
families with younger children due to the terrain. Hike all the way <br/>
to the falls and sit a while and enjoy the view while you rest up for <br/>
the hike back. On the way  back just past the second footbridge over <br/>
a stream look to your left (on the side _away_ from the cliff) and <br/>
you will see a hiding place similar to that for the Laurel Falls box. <br/>
Carefully retrieve the box. Please make sure you hide it there well <br/>
again, as it could easily be seen from this very popular trail if <br/>
placed carelessly. As usual, persons hunting this letterbox do so <br/>
entirely at your own risk. Enjoy!<br/>
