                    <div class="plaintext-content">We left the warm-ish sunshine of the upper Tualatin Valley and went over<br/>
the hill to Portland.  The sun went away as we crested the summit (about<br/>
230 ft above sea level) of the West Hills.  Following Amanda's road<br/>
directions we found the parking area of the Columbia Slough Trailhead. <br/>
What a great spot!  Greater Portland is positively stuffed with parks &amp;<br/>
trails where you least expect them.  This one (as the signs tell us) is<br/>
a 40 mile loop!  We didn't bring the canoe along this trip, so we were<br/>
after the 2 land accessible boxes.  Clues were clear &amp; led us right to<br/>
the first box!  Found that we were not the first to stamp up!  Nice<br/>
carved stamp in a good spot!  The sign at the trailhead told us the<br/>
bridge was out &amp; the clues for #6 box mention going over a bridge.  3<br/>
daring letterboxers were not to be thwarted by a mere bridge!  We<br/>
continued on and found that a tree had fallen across the bridge and<br/>
destroyed part of the railing.  The bridge had been cleared of debris<br/>
and was clearly passable... so we did.  Braved the blackberry brambles<br/>
and stamped again!  Despite the cool cloudy weather, this is a nice walk<br/>
in the woods.  I look forward to exploring by boat as well!<br/>

Also sighted:<br/>
1 Blue heron<br/>
1 Downy woodpecker<br/>
numerous Juncos &amp; Bushtits<br/>

Thanks Amanda!  Great to have another letterboxer amongst us!  We'll be<br/>
back to collect the rest of this series!<br/>
<br/>
PS..... back at Rock Creek, 2 families of river otters have taken up<br/>
residence in the pond.  We are entertained daily now by 8 (!) otters. <br/>
The fishing will be lousy next spring after these experts clean out all<br/>
the bass &amp; bluegill!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">So glad to hear that Thom Cheney checked out the landlubber letterboxes of<br/>
the Columbia Slough.  With such positive feedback I'm encouraged to plant<br/>
more!  My mate and I are headed for the Oregon Coast this weekend and may<br/>
plant one at Devil's Lake State Park in Lincoln City or somewhere at the<br/>
beach.  I think Neahkahnie Mountain planted by Carrie is the only one over<br/>
that way.  It would be nice to get a few planted on the edge of the<br/>
continent so people are encouraged to go that way for more than  a trip to<br/>
the factory outlet mall and a quick look at the ocean.<br/>
