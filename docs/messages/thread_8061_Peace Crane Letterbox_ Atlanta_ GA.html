An Urban Letterbox<br/>
Atlanta, GA<br/>
<br/>
A Japanese legend holds that if a person who is ill makes a <br/>
thousand paper cranes, the gods will grant the person's wish to <br/>
be well again.  In her story "Sadako and the Thousand Paper <br/>
Cranes", Eleanor Coerr tells the moving story of Sadako and her <br/>
brave struggle against leukemia, the "atom-bomb disease," <br/>
which she developed when she was twelve, just ten years after <br/>
the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.<br/>
Now there is a statue of Sadako in Hiroshima Peace Park.  She <br/>
is standing on the Mountain of Paradise, holding a golden crane <br/>
in out-stretched hands.  Every year, on Peace Day, children hang <br/>
garlands of paper cranes under the statue.  Their wish is <br/>
engraved at its base:<br/>
<br/>
This is our cry,<br/>
this is our prayer:<br/>
Peace in the world.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox was placed one year after the terrorist attacks on <br/>
the World Trade Center and Pentagon.  Our cry and prayer is the <br/>
same.<br/>
<br/>
To find the Peace Crane Letterbox, start at the birthplace of <br/>
Martin Luther King Jr.  Street parking in this area may be a bit <br/>
tricky, so good luck.<br/>
<br/>
Walk northwest along the Freedom Walk.  If you are a first-time <br/>
visitor to Atlanta, you'll visit a fascinating historic area and the <br/>
acknowledged spiritual center of the nonviolent Civil Rights <br/>
movement. On your left, notice the AFD #6 building.  Here you <br/>
can cross the streets and visit Martin Luther King Jr. Center for <br/>
Nonviolent Social Change and the historic Ebenezer Baptist <br/>
Church.  Dr. King's tomb, with its inscription "Free At Last", sits <br/>
amidst the waters of a tranquil reflecting pool.  Note the street <br/>
address of the old, original church.<br/>
<br/>
Return to AFD #6, and take note of the year it was built. Walking <br/>
north, cross the street, and head up the boulevard.  After less <br/>
than a quarter mile, with Dr. King's out-stretched hand on your <br/>
left, turn to your right to find a walking and cycling path. <br/>
After a short way down the path, you will see a large radio tower <br/>
in the distance.  Continue the path that heads in the tower's <br/>
direction.  Notice the multi-language peace mosaic as you pass <br/>
under the two bridges.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing on past MM 3, go under the concrete cover, and over <br/>
a bridge.  Stop on the bridge, and admire the Atlanta skyline.  To <br/>
your right the road leads to a center that you might want to visit <br/>
after finding the letterbox.  Turning around, marvel at the sea of <br/>
kudzu--the plant that ate the South.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on. Leaving the bridge you will soon come to two right <br/>
turn-offs. Take the second, the concrete one.  Follow it to the <br/>
street. Look both ways, and cross over the street and stand <br/>
between the two low granite pillars.  Ahead of you is a gnarly old <br/>
elm tree.  Follow the path to the tree.<br/>
<br/>
Standing under the board, your back to the tree, add the address <br/>
of the Ebenezer Baptist Church to the year AFD #6 was built.  <br/>
Subtract the year Martin Luther King Jr. was born from this <br/>
number.  Finally, subtract 67.  You now have the compass <br/>
direction for the final clue.  72 paces in this direction is a tall<br/>
tree <br/>
with a wide, irregular base.  You'll find the letterbox in the <br/>
hollowed-out trunk of this tree, under a pile of rocks.<br/>
<br/>
While not right out in the open, this box is in an area popular with <br/>
walkers and bicyclists.  Please be discreet when retrieving the <br/>
box and put it back and cover it well with the rocks.<br/>
