                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to know what glue-up method, i.e. the method for adhering <br/>
the stamp (pink stuff or white stuff) to a wood block, is best suited <br/>
to the rather harsh conditions that we have here in the North-East <br/>
(temps. range from 100+ to -30 and below during the year).  <br/>
<br/>
I started out using rubber cement, but I now think this was a poor <br/>
choice as I'm already starting to see some delamination in stamps <br/>
only a few months old.  We've recently taken maintenance ownership of <br/>
several boxes in our area that were placed in the summer of 2000 (the <br/>
boxes placed as part of the Bolton, Massachusetts letterboxing <br/>
series).  As we've been finding these boxes, we've found several that <br/>
were soaked.  The original placers of these boxes seem to have used <br/>
different materials for the glue-up and some of these have faired <br/>
better than others.  Here's what I've seen so far: <br/>
<br/>
 o A stamp (the white stuff) glued to the block (pine) apparently <br/>
   with Silicone was completely soaked and had become delaminated.<br/>
   Conclusion:  Don't use Silicone in the North-East for these <br/>
   materials.<br/>
<br/>
 o A white-stuff stamp glued to a pine block apparently <br/>
   with Silicone was completely soaked was still adhered to the <br/>
   block, but there was a void in the glue-up that caused a crack<br/>
   in the corner of the (very nice) stamp.<br/>
   Conclusion:  Make sure the surface area between the block and<br/>
   that stamp is evenly covered (too much glue is a bad thing).<br/>
<br/>
 o A stamp (the white stuff) glued to a pine block with some hard<br/>
   transparent glue was completely soaked and weathered the three<br/>
   years that it has been placed just fine.<br/>
   Conclusion:  Whatever they used here seemed to work well. I'd like<br/>
   to repeat this method.<br/>
<br/>
As a curious side-note, the original planters wrote instructions on <br/>
the blocks to not place them in a bag.  I'm note sure why, we've <br/>
always sought to protect our stamps from the elements as well, even <br/>
though this may make for a bag that gets dirty from ink.  Any ideas <br/>
on why these instructions were left?  The original planters have <br/>
moved out of town and we don't have contact information for them.<br/>
<br/>
In repairing the delaminated stamp we decided to give "hot glue" a <br/>
try.  Hot glue is a plastic-type glue that is applied using a heated <br/>
glue gun.  The concern I have with this is that it sets up so quickly <br/>
that I'm concerned the underlying surface will be uneven and may lead <br/>
to poor imprints (or worse, as in the second stamp above).  In the <br/>
one case where we've applied this, it seems to have worked well, but <br/>
I don't know how it will stand the test of time.  I'd like to hear <br/>
about your experiences with different "glue-ups" and how well they <br/>
have weathered.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

The key with contact cement is making sure you let it "set" properly <br/>
before adhering the stamp to the backing material.  If you try to <br/>
hasten through this step, and join them before it is set, the bond <br/>
will not be permanent.<br/>

It can withstand temperatures between -40 to 150 degrees F.  It's<br/>
clear and a little rubbery in texture when cured, in fact it might be<br/>
the stuff you thought was silicone.   Hot glue seems to be too brittle<br/>
for this use. So is krazy glue which so brittle it will shatter like<br/>
glass. Hope this helps.<br/>
