but the reason I use a different name is because I am that real <br/>
person all day long, but when I am online, or letterboxing, or <br/>
playing D&amp;D, I can be this completely different person with none of <br/>
my normal habits or traits or responsibilites.  Here in the fantasy <br/>
world, I can be perfect in all of the ways that my normal self is <br/>
not.  I can live all of the lives that I would be unable to do <br/>
otherwise, and not have to fear the repercussions, just in case I <br/>
don't like it.  Besides, you are you everyday.  Why not take a break <br/>
from yourself?<br/>

summer. My son, age 5, was working with me outside. He announced( <br/>
which all 5 years do) that he needed to go to the bathroom, so, off <br/>
he went. All of a sudden he came running out, and screamed that a <br/>
lizard had jumped out of his pants. I said, right. He said, " No, <br/>
Mommy there really is a lizard".  On his way out of the house to get <br/>
me, he had yelled to his Aunt, Psychomommy, that there was a lizard. <br/>
As I headed to the bathroom to check out the floor, Psychomommy was <br/>
telling me that he said something about a lizard. So, all three of <br/>
us ran to the bathroom, and sure enough there was a lizard. Ever <br/>
since then Psychomommy has been calling him "Lizardbutt".<br/>
<br/>
The family decided to use Lizardbutt's Family as the sign in name.<br/>
<br/>
I am called the Hiker since I love to hike, and my stamp is a hiker <br/>
contemplating.<br/>

Bookworm, my daughter age 12, loves to read, and her stamp is of a <br/>
girl sitting on a door stoop reading. <br/>
<br/>
And Lizardbutt....always wants a new stamp.<br/>

Re: Our names.<br/>
My daughter and I started letterboxing and we thought it would be fun <br/>
to have our code names for letterboxing. My name is James and hers is <br/>
Chelsea but we call her Chelly. So we came up with Jam n Jelly. Soon <br/>
we will post our signature stamps in the group links. Take care and <br/>
happy hunting, Jam (Jelly's not here)<br/>

chose 'Scoutdogs' because I'm very involved with the Dog Scouts of America<br/>
organization. I'm a Scout Master of a troop in the Cincinnati,. N.Ky, S.E.<br/>
Ind. area and 3 of our 4 dogs have earned the title of 'Dog Scout'.<br/>
Shameless plug on the way.... For more info, check out the very extensive<br/>
website of the national organization: www.DogScouts.org  If you happen to be<br/>
in our area, or just want more info, check out our troop's website at<br/>
www.DSAtroop107.com Both are non-profit with the goal of increasing the bond<br/>
between humans and canines and reducing the number of dogs that end up in<br/>
shelters due to lack of human education.<br/>
If you want to meet my dogs, go to: www.Dog-gonehappy.itgo.com<br/>

BTW, I love the names Imothep, psycomommy, hoofandspoke, plain and peanut,<br/>

I don't know if anyone has posted this possible reason for "creative names", but I know, aside from wanting to be fun, a lot of people don't reveal their "real selves" on the internet for safety reasons.  And you never know what kind of crazy people might traipse through the woods looking for plastic boxes.... My name is not nearly as fun as all these others.  When I first tried to establish a Yahoo account they asked for some sort of code name so I tried my initals (MEM) and that was already taken.  So I just added my dog's name onto the end!

lizard had jumped out of his pants. I said, right. He said, " No, <br/>
Mommy there really is a lizard".  On his way out of the house to get <br/>
me, he had yelled to his Aunt, Psychomommy, that there was a lizard. <br/>
As I headed to the bathroom to check out the floor, Psychomommy was <br/>
telling me that he said something about a lizard. So, all three of <br/>
us ran to the bathroom, and sure enough there was a lizard. Ever <br/>
since then Psychomommy has been calling him "Lizardbutt".<br/>
<br/>
The family decided to use Lizardbutt's Family as the sign in name.<br/>
<br/>
I am called the Hiker since I love to hike, and my stamp is a hiker <br/>
contemplating.<br/>
<br/>
Bookworm, my daughter age 12, loves to read, and her stamp is of a <br/>
girl sitting on a door stoop reading. <br/>
<br/>
And Lizardbutt....always wants a new stamp.<br/>

Monica the hiker<br/>
P10 F lost count X4  "L" which stands for Lizards<br/>
is at a googol because that is Lizardbutts favorite word.<br/>

I'm Autumn, because ... well ... that's just my other name.  For some of my online stuff, (which Eric thinks is foolish) I use the nick Autumn's Folly.  I may actually carve a new stamp which better represents this, since Eric thinks I'm a "fool" for letterboxing!  <br/>

So - Autumn and Ivar are really, Kat and Eric Burns.<br/>

I went to a gathering where it seemed like everyone else was relishing the hard climbs and long hikes so I thought to myself "Deanne, you are the laziest letteboxer here" and thus I named myself.<br/>

change my trail name for a while because gbheron was originally <br/>
invented as an email name for my husband and I. The g stands for <br/>
Ginger and the b for Bob. We both love the great blue heron and as <br/>
former canoing enthusiasts we always considered a river cruise <br/>
complete if we spotted one of these extraordinary birds.  So gbheron <br/>
fit us both. However, since I often go letterboxing without my b <br/>
(Bob), I feel I need a name for just me.  So, as of today, gbheron is <br/>
now Ginger Blue in letterboxing land. Not because I'm always in <br/>
a 'blue' mood, but because blue has been my favorite color since <br/>
childhood and it fits into the blue heron theme. Blue added to Ginger <br/>
sounds a little exotic, which I'm not, but it is fun to fantasize. If <br/>
Bob comes along, he'll have to make up his own trail name.<br/>

<br/>
We are the Alphabet Bandits because we will begin planting a series of letterboxes in the Hudson Valley that are alphabetical.  Our "A" box will go out soon.  Each box will be planted in a place beginning with that letter or the letter will be of significance.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as our individual names, I'm Talking Turtle.  The turtle is a sacred symbol for my family.  We are of the Nanticoke Indians in Delaware.  DH is Lascivious Lion...Lion because he's a Leo and Lascivious... well, with a dictionary, it should be pretty obvious LOL.  <br/>
<br/>
Cheetah Chick is our oldest daughter.  She's like the energizer bunny... ALWAYS moving and talking.  She also has a passion for fashion, and leopard prints are right up her alley. <br/>
<br/>
Daring Dragonfly fits our next daughter perfectly as well.  She's a very relaxed kinda kids... easygoing... slow moving, but will try ANYTHING... she has no fear, hence daring. <br/>
<br/>
Next comes Beautiful Butterfly.  The first word in the meaning of her given name is Beautiful.... Her real name means beautiful flower. and she's physically gorgeous.  Butterfly because she flits around, making people happy, just like real butterflies.  <br/>
<br/>
And last but not least there is Krazy Kiwi.  When she was born, Beautiful Butterfly, couldn't say her name and kept calling her Kiwi and it stuck.  Krazy because well... she is krazy-ly funny.  For a 5 year old, she has a wicked sense of humor, and never fails to keep us laughing.<br/>
<br/>
The cool thing about their names, is they all created their own.  I asked them if they were an animal what would it be.  They even chose the first parts!  <br/>
<br/>
That's our story... Happy Letterboxing.<br/>

he likes that name.<br/>

&gt; My son has chosen the name "Mr. Bunny Man" because his stamp has a <br/>
bunny and <br/>
&gt; he likes that name.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I have officially decided to go with "Peppermint Patti"!<br/>

&gt; Loved to hear all the reasons behind everyone's names!<br/>

Went back and checked your stamps from our exchange.  Your Paisley Orca<br/>
makes sense, but, with no information but the stamp, I thought it depicted<br/>
another John, preaching in the wild.  Boy, was I wrong :-(<br/>
<br/>
Fudrick is the formal form of Fud, like Fred and Fredrick.  I have heard two<br/>
stories about how I got my family nickname of Fud.  The age old story was<br/>
that my younger sister couldn't pronounce David, so it came out as daFUD,<br/>
shortened to fud.  Just recently found out that my grandfather doted on me,<br/>
and called me Uncle Fud, after a cartoon character of that era (a good<br/>
number of years ago :-).<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Back in the early 90's when I lived in Chicago and got involved in<br/>
&gt; Printmaking, I carved a stamp of a killer whale on an eraser.  I called<br/>
&gt; the design "The Paisley Orca".  I also carved a woodcut of it back in<br/>
&gt; those days.  Last year I carved an even bigger version in rubber.  My<br/>
&gt; original carving of this creature is what I use for my letterboxing<br/>
&gt; signature stamp and that's why I'm the Paisley Orca, I guess.  At least<br/>
&gt; it's totally original.  The design is sort of Robert Davidson meets<br/>
&gt; Peter Max (if you're familiar with those two wonderful artists - Robert<br/>
&gt; Davidson being my favorite!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My mate, John, uses the name "Maronie", which is his middle name.  I<br/>
&gt; carved his signature stamp for him, which is the silouette of a<br/>
&gt; mountaineer with an ice axe standing on a mountain summit.  He's a<br/>
&gt; mountain climber and wears a beret so it totally suits him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There you have it.  That's my story and I'm sticking ot it!  It's pretty<br/>
&gt; fascinating reading everyone's tales of their letterboxing names and<br/>
&gt; stamps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Best regards,<br/>

My signature stamp is Nancy Drew. But I had no desire to be called <br/>
Nancy Drew. And I don't put my signature stamp on boxes that I plant. <br/>
If you want to see my signature, you have to see a box that I have <br/>
found, or you meet me and we exchange signature stamps!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The SpringChick thing came about because of OldShoe.  Over the years <br/>
he has been called "Springs," a shortened form of his surname.  A <br/>
couple of years ago we were on a boat trip with a bunch of his <br/>
friends and one of the guys in the group couldn't ever remember my <br/>
name (I guess even "Deb" becomes hard to remember when you've had too <br/>
much sun and too much beer), so he kept calling me "Spring's Chick."  <br/>
It kind of stuck, with the middle "s" being taken out (I didn't quite <br/>
like that possessive part anyway).  I liked it because it reminded me <br/>
of "spring chicken" and I like to think despite encroaching years, I <br/>
am still pretty active.<br/>
<br/>
When I started letterboxing, I didn't really intend to use <br/>
SpringChick, rather I was thinking about using Scherzando, an online <br/>
name I had used for a number of years (which is a musical term <br/>
meaning "playful").  But as my daughter and I were at the stamp shop <br/>
looking for something appropriate, she found a stamp that <br/>
said "SpringChick," and thus the decision to use that instead.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks later I carved my own sig stamp and added the bee, which <br/>
is the meaning of "Deb" and the flower, so the bee could keep busy <br/>
and because I like flowers and gardening and photographing flowers.  <br/>
The flower is actually a separate stamp, which I plan to change out <br/>
every year in July, the anniversary month of my letterboxing <br/>
obsession.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Randy's trail name of OldShoe... It was actually a nickname <br/>
of his before my time, given because he is as comfortable as an old <br/>
shoe.  I put a picture to that when I carved his stamp of a worn out <br/>
old hiking boot...  He also makes his own beer, aptly called "OldShoe <br/>
Brew" by friends and family.<br/>

Imothep has it right. When we're letterboxing (including reading the <br/>
letterboxing site) we're not someone's gopher, we're not the boss, not Mommy <br/>
(we'll some of us will ALWAYS be Mommy, but you know what I mean) and we can <br/>
be that alter ego that most of us only enjoy one night a year--Halloween! <br/>
