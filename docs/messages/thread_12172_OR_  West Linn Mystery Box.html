I've seen the original stamp in other peoples' logbooks at gatherings<br/>
and envied their find.  Now the replaced one is gone as well.  I think I<br/>
might have known where it was supposed to be, but just never got out<br/>
that way to check (which is stupid because that is a great place to put<br/>
a kayak in at).  Maybe the maintenance crew found it or something.  In<br/>
any case I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to get either stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
Your carving skills are so wonderful and I hope you will place more<br/>
letterboxes in the future.  Maybe next time I'll be a little more on the<br/>
ball and seek them out sooner rather than later.<br/>
<br/>
