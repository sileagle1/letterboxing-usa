<br/>
The first 24 states have been posted on our First State Letterboxes <br/>
page. Please check it out and let us know if there are any errors, <br/>
additions or corrections that can be made. As is our Interview <br/>
Series, this is another small efforts to preserve this valuable part <br/>
of letterboxing history. <br/>
<br/>
It would be wonderful if we could receive reports on the status of <br/>
these boxes. Each box represents an important part of the past that <br/>
we hope can be preserved for the future!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

Sure, I think the more information sent to me, the more complete this list will be. If anyone else would like to respond with first finders on boxes - that too would be a help.<br/>
<br/>
You can email me offline if you would like. There's an email link on several of my webpages.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
