Virginia has several boxes that are listed as abandoned on the site, and I <br/>
have contacted 2 of the people so far. As for the others, I'm still not sure <br/>
what to do. I had thought of putting them on a website and giving a link to the <br/>
talk list links page for them. At least until I can visit all the boxes (which <br/>
are spread all over Va.) and find the owners info. <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Owners, has anyone heard from Jolly G-man? His boxes are listed <br/>
as abandoned too I think!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This shows, once again, that abandoning the clues on letterbox-usa is <br/>
not the same as abandoning the box. It's probably a good idea not to <br/>
make that assumption. Becoming the "Owner" or "Caretaker" does sound <br/>
like one is taking over the box. Perhaps we need "POC" for these <br/>
cases and only use "Caretaker" when it has been determined that the <br/>
box has in deed been abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

I emailed him at the address on that site over 2 weeks ago, but I have never <br/>
heard anything. I know he has the website, I'm just hope he will also keep <br/>
them on the Letterboxing.org site also. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
