<br/>
Placed: February 2002, by Mark &amp; Beth Bendickson<br/>
Nearest City: Hillsboro<br/>
County: Washington<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  <br/>
Rood Bridge Road Park is located at the confluence of Rock Creek and <br/>
the meandering Tualatin River on the southern edge of Hillsboro.  To <br/>
get there from Beaverton, follow Tualatin Valley Highway (Hwy. 8) <br/>
west and turn left onto Witch Hazel Road.  From Hillsboro, follow <br/>
Tualatin Valley Highway (Hwy. 8) east and turn right onto Witch Hazel <br/>
Road. <br/>
<br/>
Continue down to the T-intersection and turn right onto River Road, <br/>
following the signs to Meriwether Golf Course.  After a few blocks <br/>
more, turn left onto Rood Bridge Road.  After 1.5 blocks, make sure <br/>
you curve sharply left with the road or you will end up at the High <br/>
School.  After a few blocks more, the park is on the east side of <br/>
Rood Bridge Road just before crossing the Tualatin River.  <br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  *(All heading degrees are calculated at magnetic north)<br/>
<br/>
1. Explore the park and find a bench in memory of David W. Osborne.<br/>
<br/>
2. Standing in front of the bench, spy a large rock alone in a field <br/>
and walk 35 paces towards it.<br/>
<br/>
3. At a heading of 110, take a walk on the path staying on the trail <br/>
as it curves here and there.  At roughly 100 paces, turn left onto <br/>
the "blue dot" trail.<br/>
<br/>
4. At the first blue dot, a steep side trail goes down the hill to <br/>
your right.<br/>
<br/>
5. Follow the trail down and just before a large cedar tree on your <br/>
right, turn right to spot its brother and go to the rotted stump next <br/>
to it.  A clue is here.<br/>
<br/>
6. Back on the blue dot trail, continue on just past the lone <br/>
cedar "E" tree.  Spot a large mossy stump ahead and walk to it.<br/>
<br/>
7. From here, take a heading of 226, and go to the nearby "trees of <br/>
three".<br/>
<br/>
8. Facing the smallest of the three, take 7 paces more at 300.  <br/>
<br/>
9. Behind a leaning stick, look in a tree to find the mystery <br/>
degree.   <br/>
<br/>
10. To find the letterbox, follow this heading the number of paces <br/>
noted from your first clue and come around back.  Have fun!<br/>
