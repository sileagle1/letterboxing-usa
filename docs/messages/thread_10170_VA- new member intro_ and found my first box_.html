It's so hilarious to try to be discreet with all the shoppers <br/>
around. I finally carved my first stamp, and managed to find the two <br/>
at Gulf Branch.  Question, Doubtful Guests:  Why are there to <br/>
logbooks and two of the same stamps at Old Boiler?  Not complaining -<br/>
 just curious. <br/>

Also found Two Gray Squirrels' Teddy stamp on Roosevelt Island.  <br/>
Unfortunately, had no luck finding the other Island Stamp.  I was <br/>
sure I had the right place by the compass, but no paydirt.  Ah Well! <br/>

I have to commend you all on jobs well done on the carvings.  I <br/>
especially like the stone stairs. <br/>

I've also been enjoying the virtual stamps. So far, I've got 3 of <br/>

<br/>
&gt; Question:  I know what P and F mean, but what are X and E?<br/>
<br/>
X = Exchange.  This is where you exchange signature stamp (images) <br/>
with another letterboxer.  This can be done by bumping into another <br/>
letterboxer on the trail, or at letterboxing events etc.<br/>
E = Event.  This is a stamp/letterbox created specifically for a <br/>
special event.  Such as the upcoming DC Gatherng.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

words. You are in for a lot more fun as there are some great <br/>
letterboxers, boxes and carvers in the area.<br/>
<br/>
The Old Boiler box was once hauled off and lost, replaced and then <br/>
found.  The good letterboxer who discovered the missing original <br/>
kindly replaced it and just put old and new together.  I haven't had <br/>
a chance to get out there since to sort it all out.  I've been too <br/>
busy with the holidays and planting new boxes!<br/>
<br/>
I've had a lot of fun hearing about visitors to Pentagon <br/>
City's "It's a Holiday".  One group was frustrated to find someone <br/>
sitting there and they had to wait them out.  A long story you might <br/>
find in the archives.  When I took my wife there I thought if <br/>
anyone's sitting there I'd say, "Excuse me, I am sorry but I have to <br/>
inspect this bench for maintenance."<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should leave the box there but replace the stamp for each <br/>
major holiday?  Oooo, I know what I'd do for a Valentine's day <br/>
stamp.  Hmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>

<p>Wow!  You are doing great for a start!  Don't be frustrated about the second box on Roosevelt Island.  Several of us have looked and none, that I know of, have found it since the summer.  This was our first attempt and it was a bummer, but it didn't hold us back for long!</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing about your stamping adventures in the DC area.  It is a lot of fun!  Happy boxing!  BeMa<br/><br/></p></div>
