                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
As for the "Urban" Box in Evanston IL.  Evanston is a <br/>
very nice, laid back, midwestern, affluent suburb of<br/>
Chicago.  Not your typical park or path in a city. <br/>
One must remember that this is in suburbia, people for<br/>
the most part would respect the box if they stubled<br/>
across it.  As for the other two boxes I can not say,<br/>
I have never been to them, I have not been to the one<br/>
in Evanston either, but I was by it a bunch of times<br/>
when I lived in Chicagoland.  I did not know of<br/>
letterboxing at that time.<br/>
I think if someone is going to place a box in a city<br/>
or  an area where a lot of people are going to be in<br/>
the vacinity of the box (this holds true for public<br/>
campgrounds) one needs to be very creative in thier<br/>
hiding stratagy.<br/>
My $0.02 worth on that subject.<br/>
<br/>
Now on to stamps!  I have really gotten into carving<br/>
stamps these last few weeks.  Has anyone tried<br/>
lineloium?  I worked on a piece that was pre mounted<br/>
on a block of wood, it was porbably the best carving<br/>
medium yet, not to firm or too soft and virtually no<br/>
grain.  The drawback is that you need to press REALLY<br/>
hard to get an impression, I guess you really need<br/>
those rollers that they sell.  So that is impractical<br/>
for the field.  I was thinking has anyone tried using<br/>
the unmounted linolium pieces.  Cam you get an<br/>
impression off of those without pressing to hard.  Or<br/>
is it the soft eraser that allows one to get a print<br/>
so easily.<br/>
Mr. Jay Drew, how do you get your stamps to be<br/>
multi-colored before you place your books?  They<br/>
always look so nice, I wish we could all get them the<br/>
way you intend.<br/>
Has anyone in S.E. CT found a carving medium that has<br/>
substantial size, beside the E-ZCut stuff which seems<br/>
to be very crumbly?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listing:<br/>
<br/>
Stan<br/>

Stan, Thanks! We didn't really appreciate the stamp-art part at <br/>
first, but recently we've "discovered" that dimension of <br/>
letterboxing. I guess the coloring began at the recent "Gathering," <br/>
when we saw Tom, John, and John's kids using different colors of inks <br/>
and special inking pens to get special effects out of their stamps. <br/>
(Tom, by the way, has the gentle habit of rubbing his ink onto the <br/>
stamp rather than actually mashing it). So what we do is pick 2 or <br/>
three complimentary colors and put them onto the stamp one at a time. <br/>
Kind of like the old fashioned printing presses, execpt we do it all <br/>
in one stamping rather than multiple passes. I really like the Cat's <br/>
Eye brand of inkers: they're tiny enough for near-precision work, <br/>
they have high quality ink, and the cat's eye shape gives you a sharp <br/>
edge to reach into corners and onto little letters and such.<br/>
<br/>
We always try to hide a stamp pad with our boxes, too, but using it <br/>
would give you a monochromatic impression. We carry a little bag of <br/>
Cat's Eye inkers (that clatter pleasantly in the backpack) to use <br/>
when we stamp up other folk's stamps. The colors, especially if you <br/>
use a good art-grade paper journal, really make the stamp part of <br/>
this pastime a special thing. Check out Mitch's "Der Mad Stamper" <br/>
website for lots more info.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the longwindedness, but it's fun!<br/>
<br/>
Jay<br/>
