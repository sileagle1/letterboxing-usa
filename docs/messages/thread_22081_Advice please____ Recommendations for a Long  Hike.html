Thanks in advance!<br/>
If I may, I'd like to get some advice from you guys on the purchase <br/>
of a walking stick. There are hundreds available on line. I'm sure <br/>
there are expert opinions in the house. I'm not getting any younger <br/>
but I still love those "long hike letterboxes". I'm always making a <br/>
walking stick out of tree limbs found along the trail. (Maybe <br/>
getting ticks from handling them too)<br/>
<br/>
So what are the important features?<br/>
<br/>
Should I buy a cheap one to experiment with... or can sombody <br/>
endorse a really good one?<br/>
<br/>
Alloy or wood?<br/>
Super compact,  compact or big?<br/>
Collapsible or solid staff?<br/>
4-section or 3 sections?<br/>
Locking systems?<br/>
Grips?<br/>
Weight?<br/>

sections) and I like it that way. The two main benefits are that the<br/>
length is adjustable in case you want to loan it to someone of a<br/>
different height and that it is easily packed. Mine came from REI and<br/>
was pretty spendy but I managed to get it while on sale for a pretty<br/>
good price.<br/>

it means no letterboxing.  So I got myself a walking stick, and what a <br/>
difference!  The one I use is solid wood, with a spiked tip.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, we have started lettterboxing while traveling, and I realized <br/>
there was no way I could take my walking stick on an airplane.  And it <br/>
sure won't fit in a suitcase.  So I got a telescoping walking stick at <br/>
EMS that collapses down to 28" inches, which will easily fit into my <br/>
suitcase.  If you plan to take yours on your travels, it's something to <br/>
consider.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Exactly. Try the Leki Makalu with the cork handle. The 3 pole system is telescoping and has shock absorbers, lifetime guarantee (and they aren't that expensive). I've tried many types and believe this is the best. I have saved myself embarrassment and pain by not face-planting with these. Contact me off the list serve about a discount on a pair. Kayaklil<br/>

better.  Most long distance hikers use the Leki Makalu.  Mine have <br/>
held up for over 2,000 miles of hard use and no maintenance.  I've <br/>
found it to be impractical to adjust the length while hiking, so I <br/>
just leave them so that my forearms are parallel to the ground on a <br/>
flat trail.  Using the hand straps incorrectly can cause blisters.  <br/>
Make sure to put your hands UP through the holes so that the weight <br/>
is resting on the TOP of your wrists.<br/>

Exactly. Try the Leki Makalu with the cork handle. The 3 pole system is telescoping and has shock absorbers, lifetime guarantee (and they aren't that expensive). I've tried many types and believe this is the best. I have saved myself embarrassment and pain by not face-planting with these. Contact me off the list serve about a discount on a pair. Kayaklil<br/>

A friend of mine bought a cheap one at Walmart.  I was going to also.<br/>
Decided to wait to see how good hers worked "out in the field."  It didn't<br/>
work that great.  It vibrated, just didn't have a sound feel to it, and<br/>
about the 4th or 5th time out, she was using it for balance across a stream<br/>
and it collapsed and folded, and she took a bath.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a wood one that I really like from Diamond Willow.  It's not<br/>
telescopic/expandable which can sometimes be a problem.  But it's nice and<br/>
solid if we happen to meet stray unfriendly dogs along the way.  Especially<br/>
since I often hike with my own dogs.  I've been looking at some of the more<br/>
expensive expandable ones.  Wish I could take them for a "test hike" tho.<br/>

I realized there was no way I could take my walking stick on an<br/>
airplane<br/>
<br/>
ACTUALLY !<br/>
<br/>
YOU CAN !<br/>
<br/>
The airline companies are required to allow disabled folk to take<br/>
their aids onto aorcraft.<br/>
<br/>
It simply the law.!<br/>
<br/>
Whether that is an ECV (Electric convenience vehicle) or wheelchair or<br/>
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
A metal tipped walking stick is no problem !<br/>
<br/>
You just ..must ..tell em in advance.<br/>
<br/>
(Note) You don't need any document to prove you are disabled..you just<br/>
have to say you need a stick to walk..they aren't empowered to dispute<br/>
your assertion !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Heartland.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A final few PS's and a plea.<br/>
<br/>
please don't lets discuss security on this site and get into off topic<br/>
flames again...just look it up if you don't belive me.....disabled<br/>
folk must be facilitaed on airlines, at home and overseas.....it's a<br/>
legal requirement about equal access..simple<br/>
<br/>
and finally...just to be sure no one feels a need to get all hot and<br/>
emotional..and says "my airline wont"<br/>
<br/>
let me tell you that they will...becasue I know from real experience.<br/>
<br/>
...I carry my stick around the world and across the US by plane.<br/>
<br/>
and yes I am physically disbaled..(not that its anyone's business ..I<br/>
know!) and yes I do walk twelve miles (slowly) with my stick "up and<br/>
down" hills across wild country and I thoroughly enjoy my walking and<br/>
adore my letterboxing !<br/>
<br/>
You might even see me on the Applation Trail..still with my stick and<br/>
still walking slow...carrying a pack !<br/>
<br/>
I am section hiking it and fly between start and end points every year<br/>
..with my stick !<br/>
<br/>
So if you've arthritic joints you have my sympathy...but if you walk<br/>
and need or want a stick its not sympathy just common law....Take your<br/>
stick and go fly gal !<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing !<br/>

Also a telescoping one is a nice feature just because it's easy to store or carry if you don't feel like using it. Light weight is also a bonus. Cabella's carries one for much less than a lot of other places. That is where I got mine and it is a saving grace on my knees and other joints. Also a good stabalizer when scurrying over rocks or down hill sides.<br/>
Good luck<br/>

Thanks in advance!<br/>
If I may, I'd like to get some advice from you guys on the purchase <br/>
of a walking stick. There are hundreds available on line. I'm sure <br/>
there are expert opinions in the house. I'm not getting any younger <br/>
but I still love those "long hike letterboxes". I'm always making a <br/>
walking stick out of tree limbs found along the trail. (Maybe <br/>
getting ticks from handling them too)<br/>
<br/>
So what are the important features?<br/>
<br/>
Should I buy a cheap one to experiment with... or can sombody <br/>
endorse a really good one?<br/>
<br/>
Alloy or wood?<br/>
Super compact,  compact or big?<br/>
Collapsible or solid staff?<br/>
4-section or 3 sections?<br/>
Locking systems?<br/>
Grips?<br/>
Weight?<br/>
Stiffness?<br/>
Tips?<br/>
