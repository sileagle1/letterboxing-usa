                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello, I am a newbie.  My daughter and I found our first 3 boxes in <br/>
Guelph, Ontario last week.  We are going to go after another one in <br/>
Elora, Ontario, but the placement date is 1969.  I'm not sure if this <br/>
is an error or a joke.  The box is listed as "unclaimed", so I can't <br/>
contact the placer to know if the box is still active.  Is there a <br/>
protocol in place for this, or do I just take the plunge and have a <br/>
nice hike?<br/>

If the date that the box was planted is unknown, it shows up as 1969 in the <br/>
database. Besides contacting the owner (if possible), the only other thing <br/>
you can do is search the messages of this list on the Yahoo groups site, <br/>
and see if there have been any reports about that particular box. Searching <br/>
is slow, and Yahoo only searches the newest messages first, so you need to <br/>
keep clicking "Previous" (or is it "Next"?) to run the search on <br/>
progressively older messages.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, hope to have a nice hike and maybe you'll get lucky and find a <br/>
letterbox along the way!<br/>
