My Olympia Beer Microbox is in nearby Tumwater Historic Park<br/>
and there are several other boxes there, too.  Have not<br/>
heard its status since late November so would love to<br/>
hear how it is doing.<br/>

We were lucky enough to "find" the NailFamily's associated Dancing at <br/>
Bougival Hitch Hiker in our driveway on the 14th. A couple of real <br/>
sweethearts dropped it off. This happy letterboxing couple is so <br/>
obviously in love that it warms the heart. Thanks so much to the <br/>
Nails for a great hitcher and to YouKnowWho for keeping us in your <br/>
thoughts.<br/>
