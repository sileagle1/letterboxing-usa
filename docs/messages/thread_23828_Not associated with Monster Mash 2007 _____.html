I am sorry to send this out to both lists but I wanted to make<br/>
sure it went to everyone. I am thinking of having a Monster Mash<br/>
in 2007 if there is enough interest. I am going to do it a<br/>
little different then the last time. Here is what I want to do.<br/>
<br/>
1. Only ONE letterbox per person will be allowed this time.There<br/>
is a limit of the first 75 letterboxes.<br/>
2. The only way that the letterboxes will be returned is if<br/>
return postage is sent with the letterbox.<br/>
3. All letterboxes must be railroad themed. Because you will<br/>
find out way later if there is enough interest.<br/>
4. I NEED LOCAL HELP WITH THE GATHERING IN OCT .<br/>

Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. It comes into us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday. <br/>

<br/>
First I want to apologize for using the name Mansfield Monster<br/>
Mash of 2004. It was just easier to use that name to see if<br/>
there was any interest at all of having an event like that<br/>
again. I would like to think that I am creative a little bit any<br/>
way. I tried to take the easy way out and got burned. I am so<br/>
sorry.Take care.<br/>
