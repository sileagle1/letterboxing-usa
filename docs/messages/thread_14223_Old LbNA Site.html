But please, if anyone does know of boxes that were missed, do let the<br/>
webmasters know (you can email me off-list at judi@psychokiwi.org and I'll do<br/>
what I can). If the owner cannot be contacted and no adoptive parents come<br/>
forward to look after the box then it will disappear from the main database.<br/>
I'm sincerely hoping that there will be no boxes that are ultimately abandoned<br/>
and unloved. I'm sure there is a fairy godmother or godfather out there for<br/>
them all :-)<br/>
<br/>
This is also a great oppotunity to purge the database of all those missing<br/>
boxes with missing owners.<br/>
<br/>
Now lets get out there and get our A-counts up! (A=adopted) :-))<br/>
