Have you checked this lately?  I think it may be MIA.  There's been a lot of<br/>
underbrush removal in the Cook County forest preserves, and it looks like<br/>
your box may have fallen victim.  Please let me know if I'm mistaken and<br/>
I'll keep looking.<br/>
<br/>
To Travelin' Touts, RE: Schoolhouse Rocks!<br/>
The sign that really isn't a sign may not be long for this world.  Don't<br/>
know what it looked like when you placed the box, but it looks like the<br/>
local beavers may have found it offensive and are trying to remove it.  It<br/>
looks pretty precarious balancing by one post; my thoughts are they may<br/>
remove it for safety considerations.   Otherwise, your box is present and<br/>
accounted for.  One ziplock ripping, but otherwise okay.<br/>
<br/>
To Melinda &amp; Kate, RE: Bees Knees #1<br/>
I think you may need to rehide your box.  The hiding place is pretty well<br/>
rotted out and crumbling.  Your bags are very worn and need replacement, but<br/>
inside the box is fine.<br/>

It was a good day!!!!<br/>
