I realize that one of the moderators is involved in this current melt down, but even so may I respectfully suggest that all of these people be put on temporary Moderation status? Please let them cool their jets a bit.<br/>

Let's move onto another topic. I'm not moderating anyone but I guess we can do that if we have to.  Let's not let it come to that, though.<br/>

Perhaps instead of trying to shut people up you should instead ignore <br/>
the thread and let it do what all such threads do, run its course.  The <br/>
delete key is not a difficult one to find on your keyboard.<br/>
