I can't remember just where it had been but Hockamock had picked it up at 100 mile Wilderness and then passed it on to me.  I finally got out to put back some boxes this weekend and found it a nice resting place in my travels.  Sorry I can't tell you more about where it has been before coming to me, but I can report everything is in fine shape.  Hope that helps!Memlili<br/>
