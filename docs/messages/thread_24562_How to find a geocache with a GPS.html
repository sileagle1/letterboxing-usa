We were not very successful with geocaching.. I think you are right in that<br/>
we most likely destroyed the area while searching.  We gave up on that and<br/>
tried boxing instead as a family and were happy to finally find something!!<br/>
What a sense of accomplishment in actually finishing a search!<br/>

I was a Geocacher before I discovered Letterboxing. Personally, I like the<br/>

usually find it within 10 minuts or less. You have to let your <br/>
geosense take over. I have noticed on geocaching .com that some <br/>
people seem to have a little trouble with this. I used to be a land <br/>
surveyor and I am used to looking for property corners with sometimes <br/>
vague clues.<br/>

&gt; Hi I go with my brother all the time.  The more you<br/>
&gt; try the better you get.  If you look on the clue sheet<br/>
&gt; and see who else has found the box, you can get hints<br/>
&gt; from msgs people have left.  Also sometimes there are<br/>
&gt; pictures in the gallery which can help.  I like to<br/>
&gt; look at the map as well.  Hope that helps!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I would be good with the geocaching if there were<br/>
&gt; &gt; more clues.. That would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; a huge help!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was a Geocacher before I discovered Letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Personally, I like the<br/>
&gt; &gt; concept of a GPS with a good set of clues.<br/>
