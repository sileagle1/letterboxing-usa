Patrick Cooper of Cape Henlopen State Park and to the policy makers <br/>
of the Delaware State Park system. Thank you for your time, research <br/>
into letterboxing, and careful consideration of our hobby and its <br/>
place in your beautiful parks.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to Superintendent Cooper for all your LBNA website perusal, <br/>
e-mails and phone calls, and for taking good care of two letterboxes <br/>
that were temporarily quarantined in your office until a verdict was <br/>
rendered. Thanks for promoting our cause with the policy makers!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to the policy makers for deciding that letterboxing is an <br/>
acceptible recreational activity in the state parks, along with <br/>
picnicing, swimming, fishing, hiking, camping, nature study, etc.<br/>
<br/>
To my fellow letterboxers: please follow a simple request from the <br/>
Delaware State Park system. If you'd like to plant a letterbox in a <br/>
state park, just ask for permission first. A copy of your proposed <br/>
clues would be helpful if you are that far along in the process. When <br/>
searching for letterboxes, everyone please remember to practice leave <br/>
no trace ethics in the fragile ecosystems of the Delaware State <br/>
Parks. Now come on down and try to find some letterboxes in DE. The <br/>
First State could use some new ones too.<br/>
