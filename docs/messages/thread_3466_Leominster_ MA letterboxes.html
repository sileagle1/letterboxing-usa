<div>Hi,</div>
<div>My name is Deanne Bellefeuille-Besnia and I would like to 
submit clues for 2 letterboxes my husband and I placed on October 8, 2001. The 
names of the letterboxes are Letterbox Chapman and Letterbox Cormier. They are 
located in Leominster, Massachusetts which is in Worcester County. I believe 
they are the first 2 letterboxes placed in Leominster. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Letterbox Chapman (Native Son #1)</div>
<div>Enter the trail from the May Street (which is 2/10's of a mile 
south of the junction of Union, Wachusett and Pleasant Streets) entrance.  
Drive to the end of May Street and park on the side of the road taking care not 
to block the metal barricade.  Note there is a blue blaze on the 
barricade.  Enter from the left and proceed down the trail which is not 
marked at this point.  You will pass Fallbrook Reservoir on your 
right.  After approximately 3/4 of a mile you will come to a three way fork 
in the path. Proceed straight ahead following the blue blazes.  At this 
point the trail is very well marked.  Follow along until you come a large 
oak tree with four trunks. You will be in the midst of huge lichen covered 
rocks.Take care not to disturb the lichen as it is extremely rare and 
delicate.  Follow the path around the rocks and before you emerge from the 
second cluster of rocks look for an oak tree with a blue blaze.  Stay 
on the path and walk about 12 feet or 5-6 paces.  The large rocks will be 
on your left and when you look up you will see a table rock.  Look about 
waist high and see a triangular shaped rock with approximately a 12" base.  
Roll this rock forward and find Leominster native son Johnny Appleseed merrily 
on his way.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Letterbox Cormier (Native Son #2, 1925-2000)</div>
<div>Enter the trail from the Wachusett Street entrance.  
Wachusett Street is south of Leominster center at the junction of Union and 
Pleasant Streets.  You can park along the side of the road.  Enter 
where the sign reads Monoosnoc Ridge Trail (approximately 4/10's of a mile from 
the beginning of Wachusett Street).  The trail is very well marked. The 
beginning of the trail is an uphill climb.  Following the winding trail as 
it takes you through a forest of mixed trees. Suddenly you will come to an 
impressive stand of tall pine trees which you will pass directly through. 
Stay on the trail and enjoy the beauty of these trees which were planted by the 
WPA during the Depression.  After you pass through the trail 
continues, sometimes uphill and  sometimes downhill. Be on the lookout 
for a tree on the right with an orange F (for fire road) painted on it. Stay on 
the trail and on the left you will see a rock with a green F painted on 
it.  Just ahead on the right you will see a large pine tree with a blue 
blaze. Stop and look off the parth for a stone wall on the right.  Walk 
about 8 paces off the trail and look behind the wall for a nook that is 
sheltered by bark. Carefully remove the bark and find native son Robert Cormier, 
award winning author and journalist and the pride and </div>
<div>joy of French Hill!</div>

<div>I hope I have included everything necessary to get these clues 
published. If not please e-mail me</div>
