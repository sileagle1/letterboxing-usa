Yo Hexacat!<br/>
I just downloaded your database this morning. It's very nicely <br/>
designed. Thank you for the many days I know you put into it.<br/>
I run Access 2004, and did not get a read-only error. I don't know if <br/>
that's because of the Access version or if you fixed it, but I <br/>
thought you ought to know.<br/>
My bad old eyes just can't handle the smallness at a resolution of <br/>
1024X768; we use 800X600. Reducing the column widths helps a bit at <br/>
800x600, but not enough. Is there any way you'll let me get past the <br/>
permissions so I can resize the forms for our resolution? I do know <br/>
my way around in Access. <br/>
If you happen to be a fiction writer, perhaps I can interest you in a <br/>
trade:  I've built a fairly cool random name generator in Access<br/>
(using US Census Bureau data) that I'd pass along to you in exchange <br/>
for those permissions.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
