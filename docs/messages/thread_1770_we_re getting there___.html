Yep, we will most likely get the decals to go in with the logo patch <br/>
order. Including the few requests that are not reflected in the poll, <br/>
we are up to 17 decals. So close!!! Let's just give it time...it'll <br/>
grow.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of time, we need to be considerate of those working toward a <br/>
minimum P/F merit badge order to go in with the patches and decals. <br/>
I'm holding off the logo patch order so that we can get decals. <br/>
Likewise, I'll hold beyond that so we can give time to get the merit <br/>
badge commitment up.<br/>
<br/>
I know this sounds interminable, but it's not. After all we've got to <br/>
draw the line somewhere and just ORDER. And I will do that. But let's <br/>
give it a couple weeks. Again...if ALL you want is a logo patch, <br/>
print the order form and send me your payment. But if you want any <br/>
other items, hold off to see if we meet the required minimums. <br/>
<br/>
(When it's time, you'll hear me shout, "SHOW ME THE MONEY!")<br/>
