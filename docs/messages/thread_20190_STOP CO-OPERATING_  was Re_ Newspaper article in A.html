Stop co-operating with journalists.  Stop telling them about <br/>

values this game represents. <br/>

Dartmoor has prospered for generations because they keep the <br/>
game secret and the clues close to the vest.  Our clues are out <br/>

<br/>
Too much publicity will create a game of rubber stamp collecting. <br/>
Idiots like the guy in upstate NY who stumbled on a box and is <br/>
keeping it as a lark.  They will take the stamps and leave the box <br/>
and log to blow in the wind.  We are already starting to see much <br/>
more of this on the trail now.   <br/>
<br/>
I know many of you are greedy for more boxes to find - and more <br/>
people means more boxes.  And I know that it's cool to be <br/>
in-the-know and let someone in on a big secret.  And I know <br/>
some of you want to "control" the media, make sure they get the <br/>
"right view" of letterboxing.  But it all leads to the same thing:  Joy <br/>
Riders who come and take and destroy and do not give back to <br/>
the game.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am not foolish enough to believe that it is all bad news.  <br/>

Obviously an article here or there I think is fine - but since I joined <br/>
I have seen numerous publicity being mentioned. I thought it was <br/>
supposed to be more secret??<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you on this. Thanks for stepping up. Another issue I see <br/>
happening is that parks will start having a standard 'no letterboxing <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree. I'm still new and haven't had a chance to really get into it. But I just spent the past 2 days making stamps for what will be my Gotham Series (NYC). I really enjoy this, the creativity of it, the idea that a letterbox could set in some secret location for *years* and be stumbled upon by someone once in a while. I picture it just setting there, silently and secretly, biding it's time until some hunter comes alone and has a cool eureka moment. My luck, the whole thing will be ruined by people who's egos get in the way and think it's cool to be interviewed by some reporter who just wants to get a story, any story, in by the publication deadline to make points with some editor. These reporters couldn't care less about letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
My hope is that like most stories, this too shall pass. Some other human nature story will take it's place and the people who really don't care about letterboxing will go on to the next thing. I'd be willing to bet that's what will happen. This week's Time is next week's recycled paper. <br/>
<br/>
So I say "No to interviews!" and the story will die a natural death. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This weekend I just became a boxer after seeing the report on CNN.  I <br/>
tell you this because I would normaly be sitting in front of my <br/>
computer doing nothing outside.  I have to agree that to much media <br/>
can ruin the game. For example take the "Flash Mobs" that were all <br/>
the hype about 4 or 5 months ago.  After the media got that <br/>
information "Flash Mobs" could no longer form because of being <br/>
expected to be there.... thus it has gone the way of the dodo.  I am <br/>
thankful that I did see this story because I am now addicted to <br/>
something that just may help me to become more active and helping me <br/>
to do more healthy activitys.  After finding my first box I was so <br/>
excited I had to go find all the clues for the boxes in my city.  I <br/>
informed some of my friends about what I was doing and they became <br/>
involved because they thought it was neat.  We now have our own group <br/>
called the "Nightcrawlers", so named because we went out to find a <br/>
box at 12:30am on Saturday night, and are planing our first set of <br/>
placements of letterboxes within the next month.  I am also hoping <br/>
that this will help my friends family come closer together as they <br/>
have just had a problem with one of their daughters getting caught <br/>
with some "pills" at work.  This will help this young girl to find <br/>
something to do with her time with us insted of spending it with <br/>
thouse who she use to call "friends".<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi boxers:<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to chime in on the issue of cooperating with the press! I feel<br/>
that Newsupd8 has it correct.<br/>
<br/>
We must be very careful in how and with whom we discuss this pastime -<br/>
being evermindful of the Dartmoorian roots and how this hobby began in<br/>
this country. While the proverbial cat is out of the bag - let's limit<br/>
it's roar!<br/>
<br/>
That being said - I'd like to tell you about a recent experience. Some<br/>
of you may know that I have a website on letterboxing. One week I saw,<br/>
through my webcounter software tracking page, a repeated visitor with a<br/>
domain name of Wiley Publishing, who was all over our website. To make a<br/>
long story short, an acquisitions editor contacted me from Wiley, asking<br/>
me to write a book on letterboxing. For those of you unfamiliar with<br/>
Wiley, they publish the "For Dummies" series of how-to books. They<br/>
wanted me to write a Letterboxing for Dummies! Yuccck~<br/>
<br/>
At first I was quite taken with the idea - you know, name in lights,<br/>
Larry King [I say this tongue-in-cheek] but minor fame was a temptation<br/>
- for a minute or two. I then had a chance to discuss this idea with Sue<br/>
and 3 very good letterboxing friends - all names you would recognize -<br/>
and my gut decision proved to be their ideas - stay away - letterboxing<br/>
does not need another book or any more publicity.<br/>
<br/>
As one of these letterboxing sages wrote me when I asked about them<br/>
about the Dummies book: <br/>
<br/>
". . .  it's stupid to tell people about your favorite fishing hole, and<br/>
then bitch when everyone goes there, catches the fish, and leaves litter<br/>
and trampled vegetation."<br/>
<br/>
I feel that about sums it up~<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wholeheartedly agree with the idea that we shouldn't<br/>
cooperate with the press. However, in reality, there <br/>
was no way to avoid the article in TIME magazine. <br/>
Those of us who participated with the writers of this <br/>
piece knew that an article was in the works and hoped <br/>
that our participation would prevent a result very much <br/>
like the one in the Tucson newspaper. <br/>
<br/>
In fact, this Arizona writer contacted me and at least <br/>
one other letterboxer. I said I would answer questions <br/>
but never heard from her again. The other boxer chose <br/>
not to cooperate and this writer went off on her own. <br/>
You all have seen the result. It may have been better <br/>
if she had had some experienced guidance. <br/>
<br/>
During my first couple of years, I avoided all media <br/>
inquiries. I absolutely love the cloak and dagger style<br/>
of letterboxing. However, in the last year or so the<br/>
hobby has grown so much that the word is definitely <br/>
out. I really would be surprised if interest would <br/>
dwindle just because we ignored the press.  Funhog<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Stop co-operating with journalists.  Stop telling them about <br/>
&gt; letterboxing.  Stop taking them with you when you go out.  I <br/>
&gt; promise you it will ruin the sport.  It will grow too fast.  It will <br/>
&gt; attract all the wrong people.  And it will end the game.<br/>

theory, I don't really think it is practical in practice.  As the <br/>
poster below states, and as were our feelings with the Time Magazine <br/>
article -- if a reporter wants a story bad enough, it doesn't take <br/>
too much research to find a 'boxer who will talk.  After all, anyone <br/>
who places a letterbox is accessible via the "Contact the Placer" <br/>
option on their letterbox clues.<br/>
<br/>
This leaves local reporters free to contact anyy and all [planting] <br/>
letterboxers in their area, rather than go through the "media <br/>
inquiries" link specifically set up on the LbNA website in hopes of <br/>
better controlling the press.  There are a lot of people who place <br/>
boxes on the LbNA web site who do not read the Yahoo! list and who <br/>
would not think twice about talking to the press.<br/>
<br/>
I think we have to accept that publicity is going to be an ongoing <br/>
issue and look for the best ways to deal with it, rather than try to <br/>
avoid it or even influence how it happens.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes down to it -- we can't control other people or <br/>
situations that we are not directly responsible for -- we can only <br/>
control our reactions to these situations.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What gets me about this particular article is that it was obviously<br/>
mimicking the Time article.  Time has photo's, so this article has<br/>
photo's.  Time had permission but the AZ article didn't.  Secrecy? <br/>
Sure, lets publish the clues AND show pictures of the find!  The Time<br/>
author went out on a hunt so this author goes out on a hunt.  <br/>
<br/>
The AZ author certainly knows how to use the internet and is well<br/>
aware of letterboxing websites, can read and, one hopes, is acquainted<br/>
with the concept of research.  So rather than taking ten minutes to<br/>
read about letterboxing principles Rhonda Bodfield Bloom plows through<br/>
her article oblivious (or worse, ignoring) letterboxing etiquette and<br/>
rules, including those important to the very survival of the game,<br/>
like these taken from the FAQ section of letterboxing.org: <br/>
<br/>
- "Respect the land when hunting boxes and when hiding them." <br/>
So she proclaims letterboxes are "dug up".  Great, now folks will be<br/>
heading out packing shovels? <br/>
<br/>
- "Do not post clue solutions on the Internet or discuss how to solve<br/>
clues in public fora."  <br/>
So she prints clues &amp; trail names in her article and includes<br/>
photographs of clues and the find? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In her article she says:<br/>
  "Our initial plan was to find some letterboxing enthusiasts so they<br/>
could do the dirty work of actually finding a box for us, but, alas,<br/>
they're an elusive bunch." <br/>
<br/>
Well, we now know that that isn't exactly true.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that even if the letterboxing angels had blessed this woman,<br/>
she wouldn't have bothered to do any better.  With people like this<br/>
you can't get out of them any more than they are willing to give.<br/>

press and writing a book. <br/>
<br/>
The Press gives mass exposure of letterboxing to the general <br/>
public.  Including those who are not interested in the game, <br/>
those who would seek to limit our access, and those who would <br/>
prey on the boxes.  It's our dirty laundry out for everyone to see.<br/>
<br/>
An instruction book, on the other hand is something someone <br/>
would purchase if they have an interest in the topic and are <br/>
willing to lay down hard-earned cash to pursue.  $20 is a pretty <br/>
good entrance fee.  I think it would certainly help keep out the <br/>
"Joy Riders." <br/>
<br/>
In addition, if this publisher wants to put out a book, they will do it <br/>
with or without us.  Frankly, I would prefer to see us represented <br/>
by a thoughtful veteran, such as yourself, than someone else <br/>
who may get the mechanics of letterboxing but miss the - how <br/>
should I say it? - Zen of the game.<br/>

My personal opinion is that you should reconsider or direct them <br/>
to someone who you feel, "gets it."<br/>

Some<br/>

week I saw,<br/>
&gt; through my webcounter software tracking page, a repeated <br/>
visitor with a<br/>
&gt; domain name of Wiley Publishing, who was all over our <br/>
website. To make a<br/>
&gt; long story short, an acquisitions editor contacted me from <br/>
Wiley, asking<br/>
&gt; me to write a book on letterboxing. For those of you unfamiliar <br/>
with<br/>
&gt; Wiley, they publish the "For Dummies" series of how-to books. <br/>
They<br/>
&gt; wanted me to write a Letterboxing for Dummies! Yuccck~<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At first I was quite taken with the idea - you know, name in <br/>
lights,<br/>
&gt; Larry King [I say this tongue-in-cheek] but minor fame was a <br/>
temptation<br/>
&gt; - for a minute or two. I then had a chance to discuss this idea <br/>
with Sue<br/>
&gt; and 3 very good letterboxing friends - all names you would <br/>
recognize -<br/>
&gt; and my gut decision proved to be their ideas - stay away - <br/>
letterboxing<br/>
&gt; does not need another book or any more publicity.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As one of these letterboxing sages wrote me when I asked <br/>
about them<br/>
&gt; about the Dummies book: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ". . .  it's stupid to tell people about your favorite fishing hole, <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; then bitch when everyone goes there, catches the fish, and <br/>
leaves litter<br/>
&gt; and trampled vegetation."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I feel that about sums it up~<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
