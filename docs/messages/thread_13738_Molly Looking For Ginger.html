I would like it mailed back after you find it but certainly would very much like it to attend a gathering for additional stamps. I am really excited about seeing all the different stamps, especially the west coast stamps. I am hoping that I find "Ginger Looking For Molly" before winter. My plan is to hold a welcoming event here for the letterbox. Will get a bunch of East coast stamps in it. Will mail it back to you. Chuck and Molly<br/>

Also, I just got word that Ginger Looking for Molly is finally <br/>
unpacked and now in a box in NY somewhere.<br/>
