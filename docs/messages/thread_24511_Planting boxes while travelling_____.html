                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I first began letterboxing, there were very few other boxers in my area.  Around that time, I planted a few letterboxes while on a trip out east, a couple of which turned out to be two of my most visited boxes -- Bridges of Lancaster (PA) and Along the Way (DE).  At the time, I was new enough that it had never really occurred to me how I was going to maintain the boxes.  But hearing from the finders of these boxes was wonderful -- a great way to make contact with boxers in other areas.  Fortunately when the time came that these boxes needed a little TLC, I was able to find letterboxers in those areas who were willing to help out because of the people I had corresponded with and by posting on that region's talk list.<br/>
<br/>
I have several boxes placed in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, which is several hours from me and may as well be another state.  Most of these boxes have been in place for 3-4 years now.  I am only up there in the fall of each year and even then, am not able to check in on all of the boxes.  I have found that they kind of maintain themselves -- finder reports let me know if the box is in place and in good condition.  On a few occasions when one has needed some attention, I've been able to find somebody headed that direction who is willing to help out.  Likewise, I am always ready to help out a non-local planter who has placed a box in this area while visiting.<br/>
<br/>
I like finding boxes that were planted by those who were just visiting -- it gives some variety to the usual planters in my area and provides an opportunity to see the creativity of other letterboxers I might not otherwise cross paths with.<br/>
<br/>
I would echo what Randy said about the importance of a secure hiding spot -- always, but especially when you will not be able to check on the box.<br/>
<br/>
I say go for it!<br/>

&gt; Maintenance is an issue that has been discussed here so what to do? <br/>
&gt; Thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Of course :)  Thoughts are free, and often worth just as much.<br/>
<br/>
I think an unmaintained box is better than no box if you follow<br/>
the principles of zero chance of accidental discovery and zero chance<br/>
of wildlife discovery.  I'm sure there is an argument to the contrary<br/>
(and I'm sure it has been made a billion times, and in may even be<br/>
made in response, but it escapes me as to how it could go at the<br/>
present).<br/>
<br/>
If the clues are fun, the journey interesting, or the place cool,<br/>
I don't really care if I find a box.  You only need one of these<br/>
things to be positive to create a net positive over the null box<br/>
(assuming you don't create a negative by hiding it a toxic waste<br/>
dump :)).<br/>
<br/>
Remember, the original letterbox was placed by a traveler with no<br/>
intent of maintenance, so I remain skeptical of the tenability of<br/>
counter arguments (tho I imagine I'm about to be educated :)) --<br/>
my ethos is to remain as close to the spirit of the original as<br/>
possible in our day and age, so placing a box while traveling seems<br/>
ok to me.<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would agree with Randy. Go ahead a plant the box with care knowing you may not be back to maintain it. If you are concerned about not being present for maintenance you could always launch a hitch hiker and ask the finders to go to the letterboxing board and post where they found it and where they placed it.At the end of the log book for the hitchhiker you could ask the last finder to mail the hitchhiker and log book back to you.<br/>

It's funny to hear from you here, since just the other day we were<br/>
discussing your Huntsville, TX, boxes on the Texas list and your method for<br/>
distributing the clues for them, which we all thought was quite ingenious!<br/>
<br/>
As one who used to be a lonely boxer in the far northeast corner of Texas, I<br/>
know that sometimes it's really hard to "feel" like a letterboxer when you<br/>
don't get to do all the aspects of letterboxing.  While I don't know about<br/>
your other plants, I do know that we in Texas thoroughly appreciate your<br/>
Huntsville boxes because they fill a void in our area, and from what you<br/>
say, they also help to fill a void in your letterboxing experience!  Isn't<br/>
that cool?<br/>
<br/>
Down here, we tend to look after each other's boxes pretty well, especially<br/>
when we know the planter lives a distance away, so that if you were to ask<br/>
someone to check in on your box periodically, you would be assured your box<br/>
is being cared for.  And even if you didn't ask, your box is likely being<br/>
cared for anyway, by finders.  I would imagine it is much the same<br/>
everywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess my take on your question is: If you can find someone locally who<br/>
is willing to help care for your box and check on it and do maintenance for<br/>
you, that's the ideal situation.  If you can't find such a person, hide them<br/>
well to prevent unintended discovery, even if that means they will be hidden<br/>
so that you don't get as many finders.  And leave them with good, thick<br/>
logbooks so they won't fill easily before you can eventually get back to<br/>
check them...<br/>

I have some boxes that I have planted while traveling.  I basically rely <br/>
on the kindness of other boxers to help keep me updated on the box and <br/>
maintain it.  Most folks don't mind doing such favors, like replacing <br/>
bags or adding logbooks.<br/>
