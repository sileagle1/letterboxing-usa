Now that I'm back from Alaska, i decided to really hunt for this one <br/>
again!  the last time i had gone too far, this time, found it.  did <br/>
you know that the tree is now broken off, and the box was under the <br/>
broken portion?<br/>
Noone in alaska that we met had ever heard of letterboxing--too bad <br/>
that i didn't ake along a box! now i see that are are a very few up <br/>
there. it's fertile ground.<br/>
Next thing, I need to get out on the Kettlehole Trail that Carolyn <br/>
did for our "Friends of mansfield Hollow".  I helped set it up, then <br/>
was away when she had the special event on August 3.<br/>
<br/>
Bye, Betty<br/>
