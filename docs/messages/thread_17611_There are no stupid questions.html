I know there are no stupid questions only stupid letterboxers but here <br/>
goes....I can't seem to find clues to any other letterboxes other than those <br/>
in the good ol' US of A.<br/>
I am particularly looking for those in Guatemala and/or St. Martin. I have <br/>
tried looking for them on the LBNA websight but there seem to be boxes <br/>
listed only blank parchment pages.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [LbNA] regional lists and the list's links page<br/>
&gt;Date: Sat, 17 Jan 2004 08:56:50 -0500<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I've had multiple requests to add regional lists to this list's main page.<br/>
&gt;What I did was create a folder under the links section for this purpose.<br/>
&gt;This seems the most logical.  Feel free to add your regional list there,<br/>
&gt;tho I have added some already that were specifically requested in one of<br/>
&gt;the requests.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had a second request that people respect the default Yahoo ordering of<br/>
&gt;this links page (alphabetical), and have made changes to bring this<br/>
&gt;page into compliance with this request, since that seems fair to me.  I <br/>
&gt;agree<br/>
&gt;that I don't want people playing games on this page to promote their site<br/>
&gt;at the top (commercial or otherwise), at the expense of other peoples' <br/>
&gt;sites.<br/>
&gt;No site is deemed to be more important than any other.  Go play these games<br/>
&gt;with Google.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(If you want to play games by calling your site Aaaron's Letterboxing Page,<br/>
&gt;and your name isn't Aaaron, fine, but life is about line drawing, and<br/>
&gt;that is where this line is being drawn.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(please don't turn these two decisions into a trollfest; I just work here <br/>
&gt;:-))<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know I had another reuqest, but I have misplaced it.  Sorry :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(and apologies for the delays; I'm busy and buffer requests.  Better <br/>
&gt;service<br/>
&gt;may be achieved by posting to the moderator e-mail rather than directly to<br/>
&gt;me)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Cheers<br/>
