&gt; Hello LetterBoxers in the DC metro area. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know that this is a short supsense, however I would like to <br/>
invite one and all (from not just MD, but all 50 of our fine United <br/>
States) to join me at the gathering mentioned below.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am meeting with a reporter from the Annapolis Capital paper <br/>
&gt; (http://www.capitalonline.com/) <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; We will be meeting at 10:00am on Sunday February 16th, 2003 at a <br/>
place in Crofton Maryland called JAPSERS. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Jaspers <br/>
&gt; 1651 State Route 3 N <br/>
&gt; Crofton, MD  21114 <br/>
&gt; 301.261.3505 <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; We will meet at the entrance of the restaurant. The reporter is<br/>
&gt; doing a story on local letterboxing and local letterboxes. The <br/>
reporter asked to let other Maryland letterboxes know about the <br/>
event; to be able to talk to a variety of people. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; From what the reporter told me we will talk about letterboxing; how <br/>
you got involved, how ling doing it, etc. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Then we will go and search for the "FrankenFish" letterbox that is<br/>
&gt; in Crofton, and maybe a few other local boxes. So if you would <br/>
like,try and place a few more boxes in the Crofton area for us to <br/>
hunt for. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; So I would like to invite you to join us for some questions <br/>
followed by a round of box hunting, and maybe even a box hiding. <br/>
&gt; If you are interested please let me know so that I can inform the <br/>
reporter. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Regards, <br/>
