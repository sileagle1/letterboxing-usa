Box #11: Positively New Jersey<br/>
Location: Somewhere in New Jersey<br/>
Difficulty: 3/5 stars; Easy hike; 20 minutes from parking lot to box<br/>
Placed 05/29/2001<br/>
Clue page: http://www.pcdx.com/pclg/clue11.htm<br/>
<br/>
CAUTION: The area where this box is hidden is in a floodplain, <br/>
and is usually wet, muddy, and slippery. Be prepared! If it has <br/>
just rained, don't bother trying to find this box as it will most likely <br/>
be underwater!<br/>
<br/>
To solve this clue, first answer each of the following questions:<br/>
<br/>
1) Which university won the first intercollegiate football game?<br/>
<br/>
2) What is the last name of the Newark resident who invented <br/>
the stock-market ticker?<br/>
<br/>
3) What is the last name of the engineer who invented FM radio?<br/>
<br/>
4) What is the last name of the Newark-born performer who got <br/>
his start in 1946 performing at the 500 Club in Atlantic City?<br/>
<br/>
5) What is the name of the tavern where New Jersey changed <br/>
from a 'colony' to a 'state' in 1777?<br/>
<br/>
6) What is the last name of the Maplewood dentist who invented <br/>
the golf tee?<br/>
<br/>
7) What is the last name of the Montclair resident who rode on <br/>
Gemini 12?<br/>
<br/>
Now, take the first letter of each of the answers, and rearrange <br/>
them to form the name of a New Jersey town. Then, follow these <br/>
clues:<br/>
<br/>
Start on the yellow trail opposite the millpond. Go down the stairs <br/>
and cross a wooden bridge.<br/>
<br/>
Right before the second wooden bridge, you'll see a treee <br/>
leaning over on the right, with a yellow dot on it. Take the path to <br/>
the right, and look in the base of the tree at the water's edge.<br/>
