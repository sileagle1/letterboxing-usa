                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, just so we all don't forget, we are not ever the only ones out <br/>
in the woods. There comes a time of year, every year, that we are <br/>
joined by hunters of a different kind. They do not look for <br/>
letterboxes and/or geocaches, they look for game. So, i would like to <br/>
throw out a little reminder that bright colors, perferably orange, <br/>
should be worn when ever in the woods. Up here in New Hampshire, I <br/>
have heard of dogs being shot in the woods, so I don't want to take <br/>
that chance with my family or myself. Orange is our color of choice. <br/>
The bears may be sleeping, but someone else has taken thier place. <br/>
Think wisely before heading into the woods, whether you have been <br/>
there before or not. All it takes is 1 shot.<br/>
<br/>
let them know your not a turkey!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the warning.  I was up in NH this Fall and we did some <br/>
letterboxing in areas that have hunting. We stayed on the correct side of the lake at <br/>
Pillisbury State Park and did not finish the series for safety reason.  So we <br/>
must wait till next time.  <br/>
When we remember we take my son-in-laws orange hat or vest or something and <br/>
put it on .  We respect the right of the hunter but also obey the safety rules.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your concern.  All letterboxes take note.<br/>
