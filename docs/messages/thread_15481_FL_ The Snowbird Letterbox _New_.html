It is Labor Day Weekend and the North American Snowbird begins it's <br/>
annual migration from the cities of the north to Florida! While <br/>
larger birds migrate during the day, most species, especially smaller <br/>
ones, fly at night, resting and feeding during the day and tending to <br/>
gather in quiet places where food is easy to find...Like Denny's and <br/>
IHOP. Migrating Snowbirds also concentrate in isolated groves of <br/>
trees along the coast and in city parks. <br/>
In Honor of this Mass Migration, I have hidden the Snowbird Letterbox <br/>
in St. Petersburg, Florida. <br/>
<br/>
Make your way to the Calusa Indian Mound bounded by Pinellas Point <br/>
Drive and Mound Place S, between 20th Street and Bethel Way. This <br/>
temple mound has been preserved as a city park that you can climb. <br/>
Its original dimensions were 49 x 152 feet, with a height of 16 1/2 <br/>
feet. This was the location of a large temple town serving about 200 <br/>
to 300 Indians during the 1400s.<br/>
<br/>
At this mound on June 26, 1549, the Calusa Indians clubbed to death <br/>
Dominican friar Luis Cancer de Barbastro, who was in this area <br/>
promoting friendship. But don't let that deter you from visiting <br/>
Florida. The locals are a little more friendly today!<br/>
<br/>
Once you are at the top of the mound, look around for a Banyon Tree <br/>
that has a hole in it's trunk like the eye of a needle. Behind this <br/>
tree with diamonds at your back, look amid the roots beneath a piece <br/>
of concrete. There you will find the Snowbird Letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
Please rehide the box well, as this is a busy little park! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
