Christchurch, New Zealand<br/>
Placed on October 14, 2001<br/>

<br/>
This letterbox is located at a place called <br/>
Riccarton Bush. <br/>
<br/>
In New Zealand, any land heavily vegetated with <br/>
native trees and shrubs, including tall forest, <br/>
is often referred to as "bush". Riccarton Bush <br/>
today is a tiny 6.4-hectare remnant, a relic of <br/>
a large forest system that once covered much of <br/>
the Canterbury Plains.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the sensitivity of this area, please take <br/>
extra precautions not to damage anything when <br/>
retrieving this box and keep an eye out for <br/>
rangers who often patrol the area, in case they <br/>
are not keen to the placement area chosen. Also, <br/>
please lend a hand to replace or repair the contents <br/>
of the box if they are damaged, and clean the stamp <br/>
if possible, as we will be unable to check regularly <br/>
on the box. <br/>
<br/>
Directions: On a city map locate Kotare Street. <br/>
It is a wee bit to the NW of the city center. <br/>
