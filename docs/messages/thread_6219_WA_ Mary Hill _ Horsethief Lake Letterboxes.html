the hot windy inferno of South Central Washington to check on a couple<br/>
of my favorite letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Mary Hill Peacock:  <br/>
I can't tell you how happy I am to report that this box is alive and<br/>
well and is still right where it should be.  The clues say 100 - 110<br/>
degrees.  It is closer to 100.  The 12 - 14 paces are steps, but<br/>
otherwise, no problem. It is a rarely-visited box.  Ryan and Amanda in<br/>
Seattle stamped in back in March, I think it was and just last month it<br/>
was visited by some new letterboxers Quail Lady, Jeepster, et al from<br/>
Kennewick.  Welcome to the world of letterboxing and I'm so glad you<br/>
found this stamp!  I wish more people would check out this letterbox.  I<br/>
think it's pretty cool.  There are usually numerous peacocks roaming the<br/>
picnic area, as was certainly the case yesterday.  I finally got to go<br/>
into the museum, too and it was very impressive.  <br/>
<br/>
Horsethief Lake Letterbox:<br/>
Thrilled to report that this letterbox is intact and right where it<br/>
should be, as well.  It has only had ONE visitor, which was Funhog, way<br/>
back when.  I'm sure glad she went and stamped in.  The stamp in this<br/>
one is good, too (in my opinion) and certainly worth adding to your<br/>
logbooks, folks!  One thing to note.  As of June 24th because of the<br/>
budget, the State of Washington is now charging a $5 parking fee for day<br/>
use in the parks.  UGH!  I've got to get one of those annual passes soon<br/>
since I visit Washington parks quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Both Mary Hill and Horsethief Lake State Park are open late spring to<br/>
early fall only, for the most part.  At Mary Hill you can park at the<br/>
gate and walk down and get the letterbox when the grounds are closed.<br/>
This is not so for Horsethief Lake, however.  When it is closed you<br/>
cannot get in.  Period.  There are petroglyphs there that must be<br/>
protected and so that park is highly secure.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow... these letterboxes are worth getting.  I'm not trying to be<br/>
conceited.  I just happen to love the stamps I carved for them since<br/>
they so depict the places they are at.  <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

March as well, but you could not get down past the Rangers.  (We <br/>
tried, but they really have the road blocked and there is a Ranger <br/>
residence at the entrance to the park, so you can't just wander in <br/>
off the road)--<br/>
Hopefully, I can get back before the grounds are closed for the <br/>
winter again this year!!<br/>
