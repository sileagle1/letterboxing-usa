While in Anaheim, if the freeways are clear, you wouldn't be 45 <br/>
minutes from some letterboxes north of you in the Los Angeles area.  <br/>
I have three Eaton Canyon LBs planted in Altadena, just north of <br/>
Pasadena, which are freeway close, and listed on the letterboxing.org <br/>
clues list for Los Angeles.  There are two other letterboxes in Eaton <br/>
Canyon, so you might get five stamps for one hike.  My three <br/>
letterboxes in the canyon are about a 1.5 mile trek, and will require <br/>
you to negotiate some short but steep hills, but if you are able, <br/>
it's a nice outing. Besides mine, there are two LBs in the Los <br/>
Angeles Arboretum in the city of Arcadia (5$ entrance fee; one was <br/>
reported still there as of two weeks ago), three LBs in Descanso <br/>
Gardens, in the city of La Canada Flintridge (5$ entrance fee), and <br/>
some free treks in Whittier, planted by Jam n Jelly, that will net <br/>
you a bunch of LB stamps.  Just check out the Los Angeles letterbox <br/>
listings in the LBNA Website.<br/>
