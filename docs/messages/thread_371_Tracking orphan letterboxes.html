In a message dated 3/19/99 3:26:43 PM, you wrote:<br/>

a letterbox that might be of interest to a prospective letterbox<br/>
searcher. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I'd think there might be a way (altho I am not even SLIGHTLY computer<br/>
literate, so I might be speculating through my hat here) that each "box" could<br/>
have it's own web page, that would be accessed by clicking on "more info about<br/>
this box" on the clue page. The "more info" could include (but is not limited<br/>
to):<br/>
1. date placed and by whom,<br/>
2. special info about the box (i.e., whether it is in someone's honor, or<br/>
maybe some explanation about its designated name)<br/>
3. a place to log "re-checked on" date (for maintenance purposes, and to let a<br/>
prospective searcher know whether or not the box has recently been verified)<br/>
4. a place to log "finds", by whom, when, etc.<br/>
5. Some other stuff that someone else will think of, cause I'm too brain-dead<br/>
now.<br/>

&gt;  I'm wondering if there could ever be a way for us to briefly log our finds<br/>
&gt;  into a database that is linked to our clue/map pages... Perhaps it would<br/>
&gt;  also be possible to indicate that you had searched for a box, but had been<br/>
&gt;  unable to find it.  Another log entry option might be to indicate that the<br/>
&gt;  original owner has confirmed that the box was missing, and has replaced it.<br/>
&gt;  Maybe one of our techno-wizards can confirm if such an idea is feasible.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, its all feasible, but there are a few things to consider.  Quite a<br/>
few<br/>
people have said they desire simplicity so we have to keep that in<br/>
mind.  That's<br/>
a fringe benefit for those of us who will do the work, the more basic it<br/>
is the<br/>
more likely it will be that we will have a successful project -- because<br/>
we can<br/>
make a basic system that just works first, and be concerned later about<br/>
adding<br/>
other features which may help to keep track of supplementary information<br/>
that<br/>
may be of concern.<br/>
<br/>
All fields do not necessarily have to show up (or interfere with what<br/>
you are<br/>
doing) unless you want them to.  In other words, only the basic<br/>
information is up front, perhaps the map and the clues and the waiver<br/>
and that's all.  But then there would be a link to other details where<br/>
you could find... oh, just about any other thing you could imagine about<br/>
a letterbox that might be of interest to a prospective letterbox<br/>
searcher.  Likewise, on the input form you would just have the basic<br/>
stuff up front.  If you want to enter more information you could expand<br/>
the form out to include a place for other information.<br/>
<br/>
I think we should keep in mind just the basic stuff we need to do.  We<br/>
can always add other features later.  The two reasons for this are  1)<br/>
Easy to use if all you want to do is put a set of letterbox clues on a<br/>
web page and have it linked to the map.  2) Easier for Randy, myself and<br/>
anyone else who is helping to create and maintain the system.  Besides,<br/>
if we miss something the first time through we can always go to a clues<br/>
page and just manually add a bit of information.  This is not hard to<br/>
do, esp. if it is just a comment and does not involve graphics or<br/>
additional links.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this response was not too detailed.  I'm trying to talk<br/>
generically about<br/>
the way this thing might work and the way it will look.  That will make<br/>
it easier for people who are not technically oriented to comment about<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Dan<br/>
