this past weekend and tried to fit in some boxing along with all the <br/>
shopping we did. Our first attempt was Nubble Light and the Mouser <br/>
in York ME. The directions from route 1 were off...there were no <br/>
signs for Cape Neddick or Nubble Light right after the zoo. We <br/>
eventually found our way to the Light by taking route 1A, but we <br/>
could not find the box. We were positive we were in the right spot, <br/>
but there was no box under the rocks. <br/>
Later on, we went to Wolfe's Neck Woods in Freeport. This place is <br/>
awesome! We loved the trails, it was such a beautiful place. Sadly, <br/>
we couldn't find the first box in the series there, #1, osprey, but <br/>
once we reached the second, we felt a little better, since many <br/>
others had commented in the book that they hadn't found the first <br/>
either, comments dating back a couple years. So to the owners, #1 is <br/>
missing and has been for awhile. <br/>
Our last box was on the way back home, in Bolton MA. We stopped by <br/>
Whitcomb Garrison off of Sugar Rd. Nice box, easy to find, excellent <br/>
stamp, but the roofers on the house next door must've thought we <br/>
were a little wierd. I hope the owner of the box is also the owner <br/>
of the house, since they are very close and visible to each other! <br/>
So we had an excellent trip, thanks to Mom for a great graduation <br/>
vacation, and for all the cool stuff we did. Thanks also to the <br/>
planters of the boxes we found, and to the ones we didnt' find. <br/>
It's finally summertime, hope everyone's as excited as we are for <br/>
prime boxing season!!<br/>
