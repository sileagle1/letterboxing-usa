                    <div class="plaintext-content">In response to the writer who wanted to know what we put in our logbooks <br/>
here's my plan.  On the right side page I put the stamp and a description of <br/>
our trip to find it, including weather, animals, mood.  On the facing left <br/>
hand page I am glueing in a typed up version of the clues that got us there.  <br/>
My thinking is that in future years when we have a full logbook we will also <br/>
have a travelogue of where we went and what happened that day, not just a <br/>
stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the warning about babywipes, I wouldn't have thought of the animal <br/>
danger.  I will now remove the newly purchased box from my letterboxing crate <br/>
and we will carry a damp washcloth instead.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else seen the new Rubbermaid "throwaway" boxes on the market?  We <br/>
bought a pack of the sandwich size the other day and are planning our first <br/>
box placement very soon.  They seem more durable than the Glad brand and they <br/>
also seem to have a nice tight seal.<br/>
<br/>
And lastly, a huge thank you to all of you who have placed boxes and who <br/>
maintain the clues.  As a newcomer I am VERY excited about letterboxing as a <br/>
way to have fun with my husband and son.  I hope to meet you all on the trail <br/>
someday or another!<br/>

I don't know about the Rubbermaid boxes you mentioned.  I would <br/>
definitely caution anyone from using the ziploc or gladloc plastic <br/>
disposable brand boxes.  They don't winter well in New England.  You <br/>
may want to take into consideration how your local weather is and <br/>
what will be covering the box in the location you plan on placing it <br/>
(rocks are heavy!).  You could try using the Rubbermaid box in just <br/>
one spot and keep an eye on it to see how it weathers before you <br/>
commit to using it for all your boxes.  As mentioned before one of <br/>
the keys to the success of the boxes in bad weather are good, freezer-<br/>
style ziploc bags.<br/>
