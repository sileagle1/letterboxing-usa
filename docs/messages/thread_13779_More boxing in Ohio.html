Heard from Wanda again this morning as she is finally heading <br/>
out of Ohio.  I told her on Friday that considering the weather <br/>
forecast that she'd probably be better off staying out that way <br/>
rather than heading east into the rain so that's what she did.  <br/>
Since this was such a spur of the moment trip for her, I'd only <br/>
sent her out with clues for a few select parks, and ScoutDogs <br/>
gave her a few more for the east fork area, so after finishing <br/>
those, she went to the library did some copying and organizing, <br/>
and went out and found a whole bunch more!  She sends her <br/>
thanks to all the Ohio box planters, and I hope we'll get out there <br/>
together someday soon.  Meanwhile, looks like we'll be bringing  <br/>
out of town guests to the gathering in PA this coming weekend.<br/>

PS:   Didn't mean to leave out Seattle as another boxious area.  <br/>
We were out there a little over a year ago, and were very <br/>
impressed with the box count even then, so can only imagine <br/>
what it's getting to be like out in the northwest now.  Hope we can <br/>
make another trip out that way someday, too.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wanda's trip to Ohio sounds very similar to ours last November!  <br/>
Spur of the moment, printed up as many clues to boxes in the region <br/>
as we could (consolidated all the clues once the various <br/>
letterboxing members of our family arrived in the area)--during our <br/>
free moments we tackled as many boxes as we could, only to get home <br/>
and learn that we'd missed ALOT of boxes in close proximity to the <br/>
ones we actually found!  It was a pretty wild, boxing frenzy for <br/>
us!  Ohio's definitely a letterboxing 'hotbed'--(Does Franzsolo ever <br/>
sleep?  If he does, I bet he keeps his engraving tool in his hand at <br/>
night)!<br/>
<br/>
Hope Wanda's sore tooth is better--certainly can empathize with her--<br/>
having spent ALL of last Tuesday at the dentist--went there with few <br/>
problems, came home with dentist induced TMJ thanks to having my jaw <br/>
opened &amp; yanked on ALL DAY LONG!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
All you Nor'easters should join us out here in the super sunny <br/>
Pacific Nor'west!  It hasn't rained for eons out here and there are <br/>
lots of lonely boxes just begging to be visited!  If you're lucky, <br/>
perhaps hitchhiker/letterbox magnet Amanda from Seattle might have <br/>
distributed myriad hitchhikers in the region right before you <br/>
arrive! As for Pete &amp; Wanda, it's so fun to check out some of <br/>
the 'older' boxes out in these parts.  We can really track your <br/>
entire May 2002 Pacific Northwest letterboxing trip by reading your <br/>
various notes in the myriad letterboxes you found here in the <br/>
Seattle &amp; Portland areas.  You folks definitely covered some SERIOUS <br/>
ground during that trip!  Wow!!!  (We're not worthy....bowing in <br/>
letterboxers' honor)<br/>
<br/>
Glad you're doing well &amp; hope to meet up with y'all along the <br/>
letterboxing trail someday!  As for the Seattle quip, we were just <br/>
joking about the omission.  Hang in there &amp; keep up the awesome <br/>
letterboxing progress!  Hope the rain subsides soon...<br/>
