P= plant<br/>
F= find<br/>
T= traveller <br/>
V= vitual tours <br/>
X= exchanges that you do when you meet another letterboxer<br/>
C= confiscated<br/>
HH= hitchhiker<br/>
E= events<br/>
<br/>
I think that is all the important abbreviations. Any other abbs. are  <br/>
from people just having some fun. And as Randy stated it may even be <br/>
a code or clues to a future letterbox(thinking outside the box). For <br/>
more information you will need to go on a hunt. Have fun reading.<br/>

<br/>
I thought it was ... tho I guess my reference to semiotics in<br/>
response to that question was apparently a bit obtuse ...<br/>
<br/>
well, you can only do so much when you're trying to turn a<br/>
dysfunctional thread into a give away as to where letterboxes<br/>
are hidden (would that others do the same ... :-) ... (I can't <br/>
help it if not everyone is interested in where the letterboxes <br/>
are hidden ... I guess if you use Outlook (and I don't, so <br/>
this is only a guess), you can filter me to the dead zone, <br/>
and you should be better off) ... so, as Umberto Eco might <br/>
say, remember the role of the reader ...<br/>
<br/>
(which is really important to remember in this medium, because<br/>
I didn't see any of the early posts in this thread as <br/>
venomous in any way, tho that's just me ... tho I suppose<br/>
someone will read this post and see venom ... and that's just<br/>
them ... and btw ... I've met many of the people in person<br/>
in question in this thread ... I and just don't agree some<br/>
of the mud is warranted ... tho that's just me ...)<br/>

Yes.  I don't care to spend hours sifting through posts when so many  <br/>
are like: "Glad I saw you on the trail last Thursday, insert-name-<br/>
here, and we now have another X to add to our count"  or "How many <br/>
X's does ol' Frankie-Bobby-Joe have now".<br/>
See how quick it was for a simple explanation?<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

I had read the FAQ on the PF quotient, but it did not contain any <br/>
further explanations of the additional letters people include in <br/>
their stats, not that I could find.<br/>
I'm sorry that having questions is redundant for those of you who <br/>
already know the answers.  But when you're new to something you need <br/>

Since I've decided not to use the stat system, it doesn't really <br/>

But thanks anyway.<br/>

I like seeing what people are up to.  It does bother me a little bit when <br/>
people make up their own stat letters.  Because I end up wasting time trying <br/>
to figure out what they mean (if only a few seconds before I determine that <br/>
it is bogus noise).  Presumably, people are e-mailing to communicate.  They <br/>
are using the list to communicate to a whole lot of people at once.  And then <br/>
to withhold the meaning of certain "stats" except to a few close personal <br/>
friends is just rude to the rest of us.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I love the sport of letterboxing and I love reading about people's <br/>
adventures while letterboxing.  So I'm willing to put up with the foolishness <br/>
and will just learn to ignore it.  It certainly isn't worth getting worked up <br/>
over.<br/>
