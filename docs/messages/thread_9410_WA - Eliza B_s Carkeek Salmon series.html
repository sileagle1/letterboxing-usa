Salmon Series in Carkeek Park in Seattle.<br/>
<br/>
It was a nice walk and the boxes were fun to find.<br/>
<br/>
I want to let Eliza B. know that the stamp is missing out of #2, the <br/>
King Salmon.<br/>
The box and log book are there, but no stamp.<br/>
The other two boxes, Ida and Salmon Run, have beautiful stamps in them.<br/>
<br/>
I got the clues from the letterboxing site, and did not see an email for <br/>
her, so posting here<br/>
is the only way I can think of to let her know.<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list (and to letterboxing), so please forgive me if <br/>
this isn't the right place to post this.<br/>
