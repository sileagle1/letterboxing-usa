                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a great day out and about.  I tackled the boxes on Cougar <br/>
Mountain.  Mr Bond ( Jim to his friends) is doing well in hiding, gun <br/>
at the ready.<br/>
<br/>
The Ghost and Pumpkin are secure.  I gave the pumpkin a second little <br/>
bag as it is still moist inside the box.  The waterfall between these <br/>
two boxes is wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
The Shy Bear is fine.  He begs the question and I suggest that Ryan <br/>
consider answering with his "Crappy Stamp" version 2003. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Great stamps, specific clues ( though Mr Bond might stump someone not <br/>
familiar with the area, a web search or good map should help)<br/>
<br/>
I thought about going for the fifth box on the east side of the <br/>
mountain but the thought of the 4 mile round trip ( after the approx <br/>
5 done today) put me a bit off.  I wanted to do Candlelights <br/>
Christmas Tree boxes at the Arboretum.  They will only be in place <br/>
for a few more days.<br/>
<br/>
A most excellent choice.  The stamps by Mr Candlelight are lovely and <br/>
the poem by Mr Frost makes a wonderful theme.  I hesitate to suggest <br/>
but it is a fun idea.  Four seasonal events at the Arboretum <br/>
showcasing the lovely trees and plants to be seen there.  Short term, <br/>
get them while you can.  Hummm have to ponder that one.<br/>
<br/>
  One CORRECTION TO THE CLUES AS POSTED.  for box 4 when you get to <br/>
the Birch Bark Cherry Trees ( stunning!) take a LEFT to the trail <br/>
away from Azalea Way.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I would suggest anyone in the Puget Sound region , if you <br/>
need a Boxing Day outing, select either one of these combos.  The <br/>
Cougar Mountain Bond to Halloween to Shy Bear, will give you a well <br/>
rounded hike with the level places coming just at the right times.  <br/>
The Arboretum will give you an easy stroll.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
