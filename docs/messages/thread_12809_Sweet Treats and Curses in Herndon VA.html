                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday, Reporter at Large and I set out to find Rich's new Herndon <br/>
Parks letterbox collection.  Of the 5 boxes in this series, we were <br/>
surprised to be the first finders of 4 of them.  Waterbird beat us to <br/>
Frosted Cupcake.  <br/>
<br/>
Things started well enough.  We found Slice of Cake and Warm Apple Pie <br/>
without too much problem.  I will tell you that no one will ever <br/>
stumble on these boxes by accident.  WEAR LONG PANTS.  You have to <br/>
scramble down banks, up banks, and walk through prickly bushes, plants <br/>
and other ferocious flora. We ran in to BeMa on the trail - you may <br/>
have seen her post yesterday.  <br/>
<br/>
Then on to Frosted Cupcake.  Again, the clues were pretty clear but <br/>
the paths were pretty muddy.  Of course we've had too much rain lately <br/>
so it's no surprise that things were on the wettish side.  If you are <br/>
bringing kids along, wait until it dries up.  Some of the <br/>
mud-avoidance tactics couldn't be accomplished by kids.<br/>
<br/>
And now the cussing starts.  Rich gives us fair warning that we aren't <br/>
going to like him when we are done finding these boxes.  The Ol' <br/>
Homestead had us cursing his entire family and even back several <br/>
generations.  But we found the box!!  I will tell you that the compass <br/>
bearings are accurate so you don't have to think that the cursing is <br/>
because the guy can't read the compass.  And that's all the hint I'm <br/>
going to give you.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally, Ice Cream Sundae.  We stumbled around quite a bit on this <br/>
one, too.  Once we'd tried every direction and pacing combination and <br/>
poked at every large forked tree within range, and some out of range, <br/>
we finally figured out where we were supposed to be before we followed <br/>
the final clue.  AND TA-DA, there was the box!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the stamps are pretty dang cute.  Rich is quite the carver!  Last <br/>
weekend, I found his Leesburg boxes.  Again, great carvings, <br/>
particularly the intricate Antique Carriage.  <br/>
<br/>
Rich, I hope you'll come to the May 31 gathering!<br/>

Yah, sorry about that :-)   I was sitting around one rainy day<br/>
thinking about what emotions and experiences are found on the<br/>
letterboxing trail, and decided 'pissed' wasn't one I'd seen<br/>
yet!<br/>
<br/>
Think that was bad?  Wait a week or so when I place<br/>
'Compass Merit Badge'<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I'm planning on making it, but not 100% sure yet.  Look for the<br/>
extremely handsome 30-something guy wearing a button with my<br/>
personal stamp image on it (check out the 'Files' section for<br/>
rich.jpg under the stamps folder).<br/>
