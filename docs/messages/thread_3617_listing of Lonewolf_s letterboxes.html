&gt;   If the clues have been pulled have the boxes ?   Or are they <br/>
still  "out there " ? <br/>

Many months ago, maybe even more than a year ago, I don't recall <br/>
exactly, my computer got some virus, which among other things caused <br/>
me to lose all my clue postings.  Not being a real techie, I'm not <br/>
sure how it happened and I had no backup copies of the clues.  I <br/>
didn't do anything about tracking them down due to the political <br/>
climate at the time.  <br/>
<br/>
The boxes have not been pulled, so I'd say that if you can find the <br/>
clues, you should be able to find the boxes.<br/>
