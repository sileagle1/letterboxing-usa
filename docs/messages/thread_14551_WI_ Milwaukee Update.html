                    <div class="plaintext-content">we went to check on the Calatrava/Green One letterboxes which we've recently<br/>
*adopted* (they both were placed by BirkieBob whom we hope will return!).<br/>
both boxes are in great shape and still intact.  the green one has had many<br/>
visitors from all over, but the calatrava has only had one in the last<br/>
6months!  it is a bit harder to find, though.  anyone who wants to look and<br/>
needs some help, please let us know.<br/>
<br/>
we were a bit dismayed to find the Green One poorly rehidden.  we could see<br/>
it as we walked up  upon the hiding place.  :-(<br/>
<br/>
we also found a hitchhiker, "Sealed with a Kiss", at the Green One, which<br/>
has made quite the journey from up and down the east coast, to florida, to<br/>
here - so we have taken temporary custody and will be relocating it to a new<br/>
place, hopefully in california as we are traveling out there in a few weeks!<br/>

Weezil Series 1-3<br/>
Placed by: stephanie<br/>
Placement date: Jul 25 2003<br/>
State: Rhode Island<br/>
County: Providence<br/>
Nearest city: Johnston<br/>
Number of boxes: 3<br/>
<br/>
Clues<br/>
This set of boxes begins the Weezil series- a series of boxes<br/>
commemorating the joys of ferrets.<br/>
Location: Nature Trails across from Johnston Memorial Park (where you<br/>
can also find the missing mascot)<br/>
<br/>
Weezil 1 -----------------------------------------------------<br/>
Park in the small lot on the left side of the road, rather than the<br/>
park's lot on the right. Scamper down the main entrance trail to<br/>
reach the red trail. Follow the red trail NW, passing the Duck Plaque<br/>
and crossing several dried stream beds. Stop at the last red-blazed<br/>
tree before getting too close too the water- if you come to where the<br/>
large logs dump out into the bubbly brook, you've gone too far. From<br/>
the tree with the red blaze, take 13 paces headed SE, in the<br/>
direction you came from. Weasle your way to the box on your left.<br/>
Weezil 2 ------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Head back the way you came. Take a left onto orange where orange and<br/>
red blazes intersect at a T. At the next T intersection, go north on<br/>
yellow. Pass Chipmunk plaque. Before reaching Raccoon plaque, follow<br/>
orange trail at fork on right. At fourth tree blazed in NEW orange<br/>
(disregard old and faded bands of orange), scurry SE to sparse<br/>
remains of a stone wall. Ferret the box out here. Either finish the<br/>
orange loop or skedaddle back the way you came.<br/>
Weezil 3 ------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Scutter back on yellow towards beginnings of trails. Return to where<br/>
your car is parked, and steathily wiggle to the west corner of this<br/>
small lot. Hunker down on the last large rock on the western end of<br/>
the stone wall, view the waterfall, and inconspicuously reach under<br/>
your seat. Finally, you've rounded up all of the day's weasles.<br/>
Any questions, comments, or maintenance notes, email<br/>
