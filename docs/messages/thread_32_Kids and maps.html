'k, now I do. And I think I've figured out how to send it, so will do so <br/>
tonight. Thanks for the offer of help! If this doesn't work I'll be calling<br/>
on you!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Good for Melanie!  Can she actually work with a map at 3? <br/>
hmmm.... no, I don't think I could call it that. I think she can<br/>
recognize water or land at this point. That, and signs for "falling<br/>
rock" (we saw a lot of those this summer ...)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;What level of map would she need if she could work with one?<br/>
I think she needs a couple years under her belt, but your question<br/>
made me think about this. It would be really neat to make<br/>
a letterbox map for kids in the manner of Shepard's 100 acre wood<br/>
map in Pooh books ~ you know, a map with drawings of things <br/>
.... drawings of trees and bridges, streams, etc. to lead the searcher<br/>
to the letterbox.....<br/>

I think this is a charming idea. Shepard's map is one of most <br/>
enchanting of all. Go for it, girl!<br/>

This is a very intriguing idea.  I may have to consider doing something along<br/>
these lines in the near future. A simple, graphic map could be followed by<br/>
kids that are not yet old enough to read clues.  <br/>
<br/>
Being a rubber stamp fanatic, I am thinking along the lines of creating such a<br/>
map using simple stamps to make the icons... maybe a bridge, a big leafy tree,<br/>
a pine tree, a car (to signify roads), a fish (to signify a stream or pond), a<br/>
picnic table, a swing set, etc.  Some of these stamps I already have.  The<br/>
others would be quick, easy ones to carve.  Once I assembled such a set of<br/>
stamps, I could use them over and over to make maps for several letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just thinking out loud, here, but I thought this idea might appeal to some<br/>
of the other stamp fanciers out there.  Many of these sort of small stamps can<br/>
be purchased commercially for pocket change.  Most would be really simple to<br/>
carve, as well.  Such maps would be really fun to make, and would help make<br/>
the hobby of letterboxing available to a younger audience.<br/>
