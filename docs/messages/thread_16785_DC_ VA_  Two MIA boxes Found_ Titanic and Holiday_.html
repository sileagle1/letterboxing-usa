<br/>
Many thanks to Linda who really wanted to visit the ghost from the <br/>
Titanic and searched for the microbox even though it was reported <br/>
MIA.  Even I had not been able to find it.  She did!  <br/>
<br/>
Inspired by her find I triple checked for the missing It's A <br/>
Holiday.  Speculating that cleaners might have moved the benches <br/>
around I found it on a nearby bench!  I pulled it for maintenance <br/>
and am replacing it today.<br/>
<br/>
Since the missing Its A Holiday just missed Halloween I added the <br/>
new Pumpkin Jack stamp anyway.  And since GWForth was only out for a <br/>
week before going MIA I've left it there too.  Until after <br/>
Thanksgiving there are two stamps in It's A Holiday.  Can't let go <br/>
of Christmas in January; can't let go of Halloween in November.<br/>
<br/>
So how is 'your' Nightmare shopping Before Christmas going?<br/>
<br/>
Now if I can only get around to replacing The Inventor I'll really <br/>
be in business.<br/>
<br/>
Happy for 2 found out of 3 MIA,<br/>
Scarab of the Doubtful Guests<br/>
P.S.  I am posting this message and 'then' getting on the subway to <br/>
replace It's a Holiday.<br/>
