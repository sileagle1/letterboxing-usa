well, suppose the reason you had kept your clues from being hosted on<br/>
the lbna site because you didn't want some nosy parker from the nps or<br/>
state parks dept finding out you had a box on "their" property? seems<br/>
like the little green flags would make it just a little bit easier for<br/>
those sorts of people to figure it out if they were so inclined. yea,<br/>
yea, i hear you saying budget cuts, they don't have time or resources<br/>
to do that. just ask ryan and some others, when the nps gets a bug up<br/>
about you they -find- the time and resources. <br/>
<br/>
i am opposed to rules that require us to ask permission to use the<br/>
land that is held in trust for the public. i find much of the<br/>
justification they use to be patently false. i'm not a complete fool,<br/>
i do understand that land use managers have a difficult time making<br/>
the balance between allowing use of the land and preserving it for<br/>
future generations to use. however, boxers and cachers have such a low<br/>
impact on the enviroment compared to the snowmobile trails, bathrooms,<br/>
campgrounds and parking lots they build. oh yea, they get to charge<br/>
and collect money for those things. oh foolish youth.<br/>
<br/>
i, for one, have no intention of ever filling out one of those land<br/>
use permits or telling the powers that be about any boxes i might<br/>
choose to place on public lands. i just wish it could stay a little<br/>
more difficult for them to figure out where these kinds of boxes might<br/>
be. maybe going back to wom only boxes is the only.<br/>
<br/>
i don't understand why everyone wants all this counting stuff to<br/>
be<br/>
done online out-loud and in public. it's not a contest. and what<br/>
happened to having a little inactive and personal responsibility of<br/>
your own. like doing the work to email a placer yourself if you want<br/>
to know the status of a box and if you don't get an answer, making<br/>
your decision about going out to look for the box. surprise, surprise<br/>
even if the box isn't there, you might have been brought to a very<br/>
beautiful spot by following the clues. heck, bring a box along and<br/>
place one of your own during the trip.<br/>

Once again the list is not lazy or complacent.  You obviously, along <br/>
with enders angel, have an abundance of time on your hands.  For the <br/>
ones of us who utilize the time saving features of the list, please <br/>
don't offend us by calling us lazy or complacent.  Most of us are <br/>
hard working individuals with busy families and lives who have found <br/>
the awesome hobby of letterboxing.  The list makes it much easier <br/>
and lots of times possible to be able to enjoy this hobby and still <br/>
keep up with our responsiblities.<br/>
