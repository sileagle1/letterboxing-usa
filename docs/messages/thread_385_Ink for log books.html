I tried out the Rite in the Rain paper as well, using a standard Carters stamp<br/>
pad from an office supply store.  I also found that the ink smears much worse<br/>
than on regular paper, even hours after the imprint has been made.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are several types of ink out that will not smear, given just a few<br/>
minutes to dry. (of course, if you are stamping in the rain, I can't say for<br/>
certain <g>).  There are PERMANENT inks that acutally require a solvent to<br/>
remove them from your stamps. And separately, there are waterproof inks made<br/>
by PSX, Memories Archival (NOT the Memories Ink found a Michaels---- don;t<br/>
even waste your time going there), Adirondak pads, Designer Outliners, and<br/>
some others. They are made for the purpose of using them to stamp an image and<br/>
then watercolor it.  They come in a bazillion colors, INCLUDING RAINBOW<br/>
PADS!!!!!  I have actually stamped these on tyvek (that plastic-y stuff that<br/>
USPS makes their white priority envelopes out of)  and it works great, given<br/>
time to dry. <br/>
<br/>
I am doing some "sample stamping" in the Rite in the Rain book with one of<br/>
these inks right now, and will let you know the outcome. I CAN tell you that I<br/>
stamped and tried the smear test IMMEDIATELY, and it did smear a little, but<br/>
the image is still very clearly readable. Looking at the one I satmped 5<br/>
minutes ago, I can see that there are a few small areas at thefringes of the<br/>
image that still appear shiney and damp. However, I am sitting in a cool<br/>
house, not out in the sun. Hopefully a little exposure to the heat would help<br/>
it dry.<br/>
<br/>
MY thinking is that you are using ink that has too much WATER in it, and<br/>
that's the problem. In order to avoid that, try getting your ink at a rubber<br/>
stamp store (not the business stamp sort, but an ART stamp store). Be certain<br/>
to tell them that you want WATERPROOF ink. It's not exceptionaly expensive,<br/>
altho a little more than Carter's stuff. Prolly between $4- and $6 per pad.<br/>
Most all stores SPECIALIZED stamp stores will be able to help you.  If you<br/>
have no local access to a stamp store, let me kwow.... I can "hook you up<br/>
with" a few internet sources that sell it at a discount. (NONE of which I am<br/>
affiliated with, thank you). <br/>

I definetely do NOT recommend letting kids play with non-water-based inks.  I<br/>
think encouraging people to use notebooks that do not support water-based inks<br/>
is equivilent to recommending that letterboxing be a sport for adults only.  I<br/>
think we should try and keep it so that you can use any old ink pad you might<br/>
have, rather than requesting that letterboxers all use specially-ordered<br/>
permanent ink pads.  This sport is for everyone... not just those of us who<br/>
are into collecting stamps and stamp pads for every occasion.<br/>
<br/>
Some of those permanent inks can even ruin plastic stamps and hand-carved ones<br/>
that are made from vinyl erasers.<br/>
<br/>
We should be able to use standard ink pads from a craft store or office-supply<br/>
store.  For kids, I prefer purely water-based inks, like the ink pads that are<br/>
sold at toy stores and in school-supply aisles in the variety stores.<br/>
<br/>
Let's try and keep things simple... with readily available inks and readily<br/>
available paper.  If we can improve on anything, it should be the containers,<br/>
not the contents.<br/>
<br/>
These are just my opinions, but let's not forget about the Kids!!<br/>
<br/>

Yes... I agree wholeheartedly with Mitch!!  I can live with a few<br/>
raindrips in my books...  The better sketch pads that Mitch mentioned<br/>
have a vary high rag content &amp; will take getting damp without hurting<br/>
the image much (I have drawn an image on this type of paper in charcoal,<br/>
graphite &amp; whatever else, then soaked it in a tub &amp; stretched it onto<br/>
stretcher bars... like a canvas... without harming the image).<br/>

Thank you very much for the plastic container!  It seems to be just right<br/>
for the purpose.  You can put us on the list for a bulk order when you're<br/>
are really.  See if they will ship to us direct even if  the order is from a<br/>
bunch of us....getting that price break?<br/>
<br/>
We are happy to announce that a Arkansas letterbox will be placed this<br/>
Sunday...maybe two.  They will be placed in the Buffalo National River area<br/>
in Northern Arkansas.  One will be at Hemmed-in-Hollow, the highest<br/>
waterfall in the midwest and the other at Indian Creek inwhich is  beautiful<br/>
with it's own cave and waterfalls.  I will be back next week with the clues.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been reading all the controversy about the waterproof paper/waterproof<br/>
ink.   Seems that the BEST, most indestructible solution is using waterproof<br/>
INK AND waterproof PAPER. However, indestructibility is not the only issue<br/>
here.  Being the chronological adult that I am, (as opposed to being a MENTAL<br/>
adult :o)),  I had not thought about KIDS being involved in this. Now, it's<br/>
VERY true that kids would have this waterproof ink all OVER themselves, and<br/>
all over anyone within 20 feet of them. So, for the sake of including KIDS,<br/>
you almost HAVE to have paper that can be stamped with water-soluble ink.<br/>
(However, as I understand it, we each carry our OWN ink pads, so we all can<br/>
can use whatever we want. )  <br/>
<br/>
As for the watercolor paper being able to stand up to wetness... yep, it sure<br/>
will. Many arteests DO soak the paper before painting, and it is MADE for<br/>
that. So THAT solves the PAPER issue... HOWEVER, even if the PAPER can take<br/>
the water, the water-soluble INKS cannot. THey will have faded and run all<br/>
over the place, and the images will not be readable.  So it's not really the<br/>
PAPER that's the issue, either.<br/>
<br/>
So what it boils down to, in essence, is this:<br/>
<br/>
If you want kids to use water-soluble ink, you don;t need to worry about the<br/>
durability of the PAPER or the INK. YOu need to worry about the water-<br/>
tightness of the CONTAINER!!!!!!  If the container is adequate, the rest is<br/>
cake!!!!<br/>
