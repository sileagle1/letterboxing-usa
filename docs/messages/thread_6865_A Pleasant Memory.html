I found our first box.  It was so very cool, [winter time I think :)].<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was a 2 box series.  We'd just learned how to use a <br/>
compass (from the website) and after the owner's clues led us all <br/>
over the park we found the boxes (almost at our starting point).  <br/>
Excitement would be an understatement for the way we felt.  My wife <br/>
was so thrilled with the find I thought she was going to pass out!!  <br/>
That was nothing compared to the time we found our one and only <br/>
HitchHiker.<br/>
<br/>
After that I beleive we stamped into every box in the area inside of <br/>
2 weeks.  I discovered that I could really butcher a block of the <br/>
Speedball (white stuff) carving medium; now I think I can make a <br/>
decent rendering of a stickman.<br/>
<br/>
That was almost a year ago and we now have a few boxes planted and a <br/>
few HitchHikers set loose.  Our excitement grows everytime we see a <br/>
new post for a box in our area or a post on the boards engaging the <br/>
hobby in a new direction.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I just wanted to share how much fun letterboxing has been for <br/>
us and hope it continues to be.<br/>
