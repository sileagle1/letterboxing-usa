<br/>
  Location - Font Hill Wetlands Park on Centennial Lane in Columbia,<br/>
             MD<br/>
  County -   Howard<br/>
  Planted -  October 23, 2002<br/>
  Planted by- Psychomommy and The Turtle<br/>
  Easy Walk/Stroll  Wheelchair accessable, but you need assistance<br/>
              to fetch the box. <br/>
  Park in the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses Parking lot, close <br/>
  to the park entrance. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   From her bedroom, Nikki could hear her grandfather getting his <br/>
fishing gear together. The excitement of going with him for the very <br/>
first time was too much for the little girl. He had been ill and said <br/>
he would enjoy her help and her company.<br/>
  This is a small park but to Nikki it appeared very large. She would <br/>
see all kinds of beautiful birds and get to watch beavers build their <br/>
dams.<br/>
   As they entered the park they could see the zig zag path that led <br/>
to a gazebo in the middle of the pond. Grandpa said they would pass <br/>
it for now. But later, it would be a nice place to have their lunch.<br/>
    They passed a pier with 2 benches and continued down the path. <br/>
Grandpa pointed to his left at all the squirrel nests in the trees. <br/>
Nikki had no idea that squirrels built nests like birds. Grandpa was <br/>
so smart, she thought. <br/>
    They came to a bridge on the left. That was the way to the <br/>
beavers and their dams. You can take a nice short stroll down this <br/>
path. Grandpa said he wanted to fish first so on they travelled.<br/>
     Nikki and Grandpa met up with Dawson Lee and decided to take "a <br/>
breather", as grandpa called it. Grandpa said he had a special <br/>
surprise for Nikki and she would have to look for it.<br/>
    To your left are two, old, large twisted maple trees. Behind the <br/>
left one are downed branches from a nearby dead tree. Look in the <br/>
middle for what you seek.<br/>
    Nikki was very happy to see the surprise. She told her grandpa <br/>
she would always remember this special day and the time they spent <br/>
together. The End.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">--- Princess Turtle is planting her series this Saturday. We Hope! <br/>
Then my table is clean. I'll try to post the clues right away so you <br/>
can try for those boxes (3) while your down this way. Also "Going <br/>
Fishing" is close to Patapsco State Park. <br/>
    I'm working on a new Mystery Box too. The Turtle says I'm doing <br/>
it backwords. I haven't made the stamp yet. This one will be a little <br/>
tougher (I think) than my other Mystery Box. <br/>
    I have so many new ideas for boxes that I might have to set up a <br/>
seperate room in the house for all the paraphernalia I use to make a <br/>
box. I have a VERY special series coming out by Nov. 8th. The stamps <br/>
are made. I just need to find a good convenient place for all of our <br/>
new friends to hunt.<br/>
