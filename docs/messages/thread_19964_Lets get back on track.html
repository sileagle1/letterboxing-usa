and didn't get a reply, so I am hoping someone here might be able to <br/>
help me. I am in Maine:<br/>
<br/>
Hello,<br/>
I was wondering if anyone knew if Bulldog and The Ram were around<br/>
here. I went to find their Wolf Neck Woods Letterboxes today and<br/>
they were missing. Aparently they have been missing for a while. I<br/>
was hoping to get in contact with them to either let them know, or<br/>
ask if I could replace the boxes and adopt them for them. Anyone<br/>
have any ideas what I should do? The clues are really great and the<br/>
spots were wonderful, too. I feel there should be boxes there.<br/>

If you haven't already figured it out I really enjoy the off-shoot, <br/>
off-topic, off-center threads.  Hell, I live for 'em.  If you don't <br/>
like the silliness, don't read the threads.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to put on a goofy hat, perform silly walks, and play with <br/>
my rubber chicken while I enjoy the off-topic ramblings of these <br/>
clever letterboxers.<br/>

Isn't that why we put headers in the subject lines?<br/>
If you are offended or bored or whatever - there's a handy little key labeled "Delete" that totally takes care of the problem.<br/>
Different strokes [and keys!] for different folks! [And so on and so on . . . .]<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! <br/>

eccentrics, my mind is being opened to new ideas and prodding me onto <br/>
new thought paths. (And I've become quite popular with the squirrels.)<br/>
<br/>
Unless you are obsessive compulsive, folks who don't like rambling <br/>
and ranting can quietly pass over the subject lines that do not <br/>
appeal to them.  I say they 'can,' and though many do, there are <br/>
always some who must make comment to say 'stop talking about that.'<br/>
<br/>
Which, of course, makes me want to comment, 'stop commenting, asking <br/>
people to stop commenting.'<br/>
<br/>
But, then, I'd be just like them.  So, instead, I'll sit quietly and <br/>
NOT comment, making a resounding tacit statement of tsk tsk tsk.<br/>
