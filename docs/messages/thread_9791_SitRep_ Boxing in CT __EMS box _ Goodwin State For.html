                    <div class="plaintext-content">TeamGreenDragon took to the trails on Saturday and enjoyed finding <br/>
all six boxes of the "Christmas Around the World" series at Pumpkin <br/>
Hill in Chaplin. These are very nice stamps and anybody in the area <br/>
should try to visit these boxes while the holidays are still with <br/>
us.After that we moved on to Chuck, Molly &amp; Chickabirdie's "Celestial <br/>
Series"  at the Goodwin State Forest in Hampton. After finding the <br/>
six boxes in this series (This is a very nice spot) we came across <br/>
another box planted by the people of EMS, the stamp is a small tree. <br/>
Does anybody know what the name of this box is?<br/>
 Thanks, Chuck, Molly, Chickabirdie, IrishTinker and of course her <br/>
elf Rosie Bunny. <br/>
<br/>
To all the wonderful Letterboxers out there:<br/>
<br/>
We wish all of you the very nicest Christmas and hope you all have a <br/>
wonderful NewYear.<br/>
