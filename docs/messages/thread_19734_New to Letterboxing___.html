Letter boxing for those in South Carolina. Are you looking for a box<br/>
located in South Carolina, are you placing a box in South Carolina, do<br/>
you live in South Carolina, or are you going to visit South Carolina<br/>
and do some letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
We're the place for you.<br/>
<br/>
What is letterboxing?  http://letterboxing.org/<br/>
<br/>
My children and I just read an article in the July 26, 2004 times<br/>
called "Hide-and-Seek for Grownups", we loved the idea and will be<br/>
incorporating letterboxing in South Carolina into our<br/>
History/Geography lessons this year.  We would like to put out at<br/>
least 100 boxes across South Carolina!  However, to count finds we<br/>
must find boxes other than our own.  We're hoping we can interest<br/>
other homeschoolers in South Carolina to join us in letterboxing!  <br/>
Please pass this message on to any SC homeschool groups, and to anyone<br/>
in South Carolina that is interested in education, history, geography,<br/>
or some great family leisure and fun!<br/>

I introduced my science teacher (I take suplimentary classes at this homeschooling school basically) and he loved it. So now he's gonna use a bunch of the boxes for his classes, like the forensic class, we'll be doing the murder at gabriel park box (which is a murder mystery- very cool, but very hard). After you get it all set up, I'd like to know how it turned out.<br/>
