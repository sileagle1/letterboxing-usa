together at the spring to wash away our former selves.  Repent!  Repent!  I <br/>
say.  Forgo your mindless pursuit of superficial rewards.  Lay down your <br/>
burdens with your fellow seekers for the day so that you may box anew.<br/>
<br/>
Heed my call!  For many years now we have met and we shall meet again just <br/>
days before you gather with your family and friends to be thankful for what <br/>
has been given to you.  That place which is old shall be new again, there <br/>
shall our congregation meet.<br/>
<br/>
I seek a host of angels to greet my wayward flock.  Let those among you who <br/>
can capture their divine image be known to me.<br/>
<br/>
Patience, patience.  All will soon be made clear.<br/>
<br/>
Yours in eternal pursuit,<br/>
The Right Rev Thomas Noone<br/>
