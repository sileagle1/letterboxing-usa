Vasque. Go to their website, www.lowaboots.com. If you don't have an<br/>
outdoor shop near you, let me know. The new Escape Goat by Montrail is a<br/>
great feeling low boot at $95 or the new Reflex by Merrell at $85. Need<br/>
waterproof low boots? Java by Montrail at $120. Not trying to be<br/>
commercial here, but these are all very good shoes for women. Your local<br/>
outdoor retailer can help you a lot! Don't forget the Superfeet insoles!<br/>
