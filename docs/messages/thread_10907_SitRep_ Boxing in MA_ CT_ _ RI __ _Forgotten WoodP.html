                    <div class="plaintext-content">TeamGreenDragon had a great time hunting in the snow over the weekend <br/>
and<br/>
found the following boxes. All in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
"Crossways Crossed Paths" in East Greenwich RI . Found both of these <br/>
and<br/>
loved the camo ( I'll probably be copycating the idea sometime in the<br/>
future) !!<br/>
<br/>
"Bird House" at the Needham Town Forest in MA . What a wonderful box <br/>
this<br/>
is ! It took us a while to spot that first birdhouse but from there <br/>
things<br/>
just got better and better : ) !! Even in the snow drifts the train <br/>
looked<br/>
awesome !! I was wondering if in the warm weather the train runs on <br/>
any<br/>
kind of regular schedule ? I would love to come back and see it in<br/>
operation .<br/>
<br/>
We finally ended up back in Mansfield CT to pick up "The Feed Store " <br/>
of<br/>
the Mansfield Depot Series .<br/>
<br/>
I wont bother listing the ones we gave up on do to snow cover . I do <br/>
have a<br/>
question for Molly . Is it possible some Bipeds may have removed the <br/>
fallen<br/>
trees from the path going to " Forgotten Woodpile " ? We found what we<br/>
thought was the wood piles but didn't step over any logs getting <br/>
there (<br/>
They may have been under the snow ) I think the box itself is under <br/>
about<br/>
three feet of drifted snow.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks All<br/>

</p><p>It is possible that someone cleaned up the trail and cut the fallen trees. No one has told me that but in any other season, the woodpiles would be very visible from the trail. The woodpile is actually a few rows of long woodpiles that are half rotted. With the snow they may look like mounds of snow. Will get out there when some snow melts and check it out and re word the clues if neccessary.Thanks .....Chuck and Molly
