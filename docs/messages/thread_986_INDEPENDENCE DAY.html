               REMEMBERING INDEPENDENCE DAY<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever wondered what happened to the<br/>
56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence?<br/>
<br/>
Five signers were captured by the British as<br/>
traitors, and tortured before  they died.<br/>
<br/>
Twelve had their homes ransacked and burned.<br/>
Two lost their sons serving in the Revolutionary Army;<br/>
another had two sons captured.<br/>
<br/>
Nine of the 56 fought and died from wounds or<br/>
hardships of the Revolutionary War.<br/>
<br/>
They signed and they pledged their lives, their<br/>
fortunes, and their sacred  honor.  What kind of men<br/>
were they? <br/>
<br/>
Twenty-four were lawyers and jurists.  Eleven were<br/>
merchants, nine were farmers and large plantation<br/>
owners; men of means, well educated. But they signed<br/>
the Declaration of Independence  knowing full well<br/>
that the penalty would be death if they were captured.<br/>
Carter Braxton of Virginia, a wealthy planter<br/>
and trader, saw his ships swept from the seas by the<br/>
British Navy.  He sold his home and properties  to pay<br/>
his debts, and died in rags.<br/>
<br/>
Thomas McKeam was so hounded by the British that he<br/>
was forced to move his family almost constantly. He<br/>
served in the Congress without pay, and  his family<br/>
was kept in hiding. His possessions were taken from<br/>
him, and poverty was his reward.<br/>
<br/>
Vandals or soldiers looted the properties of Dillery,<br/>
Hall, Clymer, Walton, Gwinnett, Heyward, Ruttledge,<br/>
and<br/>
 Middleton.<br/>
<br/>
At the battle of Yorktown, Thomas Nelson Jr, noted<br/>
that the British General Cornwallis had taken over the<br/>
Nelson home for his headquarters. He quietly urged<br/>
General George Washington to open fire. The home was<br/>
destroyed, and Nelson died bankrupt.<br/>
<br/>
Francis Lewis had his home and properties destroyed.<br/>
The enemy jailed his wife, and she died within a few<br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
John Hart was driven from his wife's bedside as she<br/>
was dying. Their 13 children fled for their lives.His<br/>
fields and his gristmill were laid to  waste.  For<br/>
more than a year he lived in forests and caves,<br/>
returning home to  find his wife dead and his children<br/>
vanished. A few weeks later he died from exhaustion<br/>
and a broken heart.  Norris and Livingston suffered<br/>
similar fates.<br/>
<br/>
Such were the stories and sacrifices of the American<br/>
Revolution.  These were not wild-eyed, rabble-rousing<br/>
ruffians. They were soft-spoken men of means and<br/>
education. They had security, but they valued liberty<br/>
more.  Standing tall, straight, and unwavering, they<br/>
pledged: "For the support of this  declaration, with<br/>
firm reliance on the protection of the divine<br/>
providence, we mutually pledge to each other, our<br/>
lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor."<br/>
<br/>
They gave you and me a free and independent America.<br/>
The history books never told you a lot about what<br/>
happened in the Revolutionary War. We didn't fight<br/>
just the British. We were British subjects at that<br/>
time and we fought our own government!  Some of us<br/>
take these<br/>
liberties so much for granted, but we shouldn't. So,<br/>
take a few minutes while enjoying your 4th of July<br/>
holiday and silently thank these patriots. It's not<br/>
much to ask for the price they  paid.<br/>
Remember: freedom is never free!<br/>
<br/>
The Fourth of July has more to it than beer, picnics,<br/>
baseball games, and fireworks.<br/>

What an awesome and awe inspiring group of men ... I get chills every time I <br/>
read of their sacrifices especially since they and they're children were not <br/>
the ones to benefit from their hard work ,,, <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
