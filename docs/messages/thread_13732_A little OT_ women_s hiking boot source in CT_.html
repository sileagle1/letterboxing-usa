<br/>
I'm in desperate need of new hiking boots and I'd like to be fit properly<br/>
for them.  I've been really discouraged by the selection at the sporting<br/>
goods stores around here and thought I'd check in with you all to see if you<br/>
have any suggestions.  We moved here from MN a few years ago, and I know<br/>
where I'd go in the Minneapolis area...but I'm at a loss here.  The best<br/>
source I found so far is EMS, but the guy was waaaay less than helpful so I<br/>
walked out (I'm kinda convinced that the right pair is there, but I lost my<br/>
patience with him as it seemed like I was inconveniencing him with my<br/>
questions).  I'd like to take a trek up to L.L. Bean but I'm afraid I'll<br/>
need to get a new pair before I can make it up there.  I think I might take<br/>
a trip to REI in Framingham, MA...but you all may have a better suggestion<br/>
for closer to home.  BTW, we're in the Hartford area.<br/>
<br/>
TIA!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The EMS in Manchester is usually pretty helpful. Otherwise, try <br/>
Mickey Finn's on the Berlin Tpke?  We've gotten most of our Merrell <br/>
hiking boots there and they have other brands too.<br/>
Good luck in your search!   "Bee Happy"<br/>
