  AS a long time rubber stamper, I use baby wipes. They are easy to<br/>
  carry and do an excellent job. They do not tend ot dry out the<br/>
  stamps. Purple Iris<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's a good point and it brings to mind a question Funhog.  Since you've been working with animals, you certainly have more experience than I do in this, so, can you answer a question for me?<br/>
<br/>
When you speak of Unscented/Scented, are you referring to something that has a scent added, such as 'Fresh smelling' or 'Lemon scented',  etc, etc?  Does Unscented mean something that does not have a scent added?  I.E., Plain, regular, Windex?  It has an ammonia scent, but nothing added, would that be alright?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking the time to answer.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, even though they don't have perfume added, the soap in the wipes do <br/>
have a scent.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good point.... Does that mean that any cleaning substance other than water is unacceptable then?  Because water hardly removes the gunk and muck that I've seen on some of the stamps that we have discovered.<br/>
<br/>
What should one use if water doesn't clean the stamp correctly?  In my case, now that we are using washable markers, water works perfectly to clean the stamp when we are done.<br/>
