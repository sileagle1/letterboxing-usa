there and able to see the expression on your child's face, why did you let<br/>
your kid click on a link like that anyway.  Maybe you need to tell them that<br/>
there are some key words in links that they are not allowed to click on.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell this conversation is going to go 'round and round'....hope you<br/>
took the earlier advice and contacted the moderators via email directly.<br/>
