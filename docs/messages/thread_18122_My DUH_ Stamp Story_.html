Norfolk, MA), has seen the result of my first try carving letters.  <br/>
They came out backwards 'cause I carved them wrong!  I kept the stamp <br/>
that way because I thought it looked kinda neat AND it was my first <br/>
stamp ever...how could I throw that away??<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have been getting progressively better at carving.  I just <br/>
carved two personal stamps for Jay and I to replace the store-bought <br/>
box turtle stamp we have been using since we started boxing in August.<br/>
<br/>
And last week I carved MY FAVORITE STAMP EVER!  I was so proud of <br/>
it!  I thought for days before I decided what to call the letterbox I <br/>
would place it in.  Then I carefully wrote the name at the spot I <br/>
left on my stamp.  I carved and carved and carved and it looked <br/>
beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Then I stamped...now I am a pretty bright person, I occasionally make <br/>
mistakes but I learn from my first mistake - I tend not to repeat <br/>
myself.  Not in this case...my letters stamped out <br/>
backwards!!!!!!!!!  I thought I was going to cry!  Jay looked at me <br/>
in disbelief and asked "Didn't that happen the first time you made a <br/>
stamp"?  I felt like such an idiot!!<br/>
<br/>
Be on the lookout for this stamp...its gonna be a mystery box in MA <br/>
and I am planting it today.  If you find it, you'll notice the place <br/>
where the words were (luckily, it was a strip at the top, so i just <br/>
cut the top of the stamp off, phew!).<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">LOL. Me too. My first carved stamp was for an exchange with 3 other <br/>
boxers in different parts of the country. I carved away and, upon <br/>
finishing, nearly smacked my forehead. Yes, I had carved my name in <br/>
backwards....... I decided to embrace it and have carved my name so it <br/>
stamps backwards on the rest of the stamps I've carved. However, my <br/>
trail name is relatively easy to read backwards and looks kinda neat <br/>
(imho) that way. Besides, why shouldn't my stamps be partly normal and <br/>
partly quirky, just like me? :-)<br/>
