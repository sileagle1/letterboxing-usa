<br/>
Location: Batavia, Ohio<br/>
<br/>
Address: Take SR 125 Amelia  from I-275 about 11 miles, Bantam Road is Left at the<br/>
light and SR 222 is to the Right.  Goto The Left, The park is about .5 Miles to the<br/>
Left.  Once on the Park Road, Be on the lookout as after you pass Newman Trail<br/>
you will need to start looking for Indian Trail<br/>
<br/>
Level: 1 (Easy)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Need: Stamp Pad, Pen<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Look for a water Fountin with the yellow number 8. From here<br/>
take a reading of 280' and walk 65 steps. This should take you to the<br/>
corner of the woods. Now take a reading of 240' and walk 26 steps<br/>
to a row of small pine tree's. 7 steps behind the pine tree's at 340'<br/>
into the woods you will see a Triple Tree with one bad trunk. The<br/>
box is at the bottom in between the tree.<br/>
