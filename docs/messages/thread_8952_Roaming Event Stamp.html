Yep, the roving event stamp made an appearance at the South <br/>
Sound Letterboxing Quest Fest, although as I recall we did have <br/>
a little trouble fitting my event stamp into the logbook.  I don't <br/>
think you had in mind a big, honking stamp of the variety I carved.  <br/>
But we split the image across two pages and it all worked out <br/>
well.  =)<br/>
<br/>
I also got to check out the event stamp from the mystery <br/>
gathering.  Wow!  <br/>

<br/>
I was reading in the archives about some of the LB gatherings that <br/>
have come and gone, trying to garner ideas for our first <br/>
Michigan/Great Lakes gathering being held May 31st, and came across <br/>
this message regarding your roaming event stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday the mailman brought me one of the K-Martha stamps, which <br/>
I'm sure will be a big hit.  It would be really great if your roaming <br/>
event stamp could also be in appearance at our gathering.  Being the <br/>
first event in Michigan/upper Midwest area, and the hobby being <br/>
relatively young here, there is a lot of enthusiasm, and things such <br/>
as these stamps only serve to heighten that, and make our group feel <br/>
an official part of the letterboxing community.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if this might be possible to arrange.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
