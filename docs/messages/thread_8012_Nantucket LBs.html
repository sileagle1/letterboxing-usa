                    <html><body>Made my 16th trip to Nantucket last week with something new to do-- Took a Mt. bike out to find letterboxes!! Total BUMMER though. . .looked for 4 and found ZERO! Brandt Point, Sankety, Altar Rock and the Abiah Folger rock boxes were not to be seen. Except for the last locale, these sites are WAY too public and visited by high schoolers out for fun so the chance of them surviving was nil. I knew this before I started out but went anyway.
<br/>
<br/>The good news is, my husband and I continued our trip through MA, RI, CT and NJ and were able to find 9 of the 10 we looked for, the 10th probably lost to recent road work we think. I made a convert out of my husband and at KJs Best in Coventry (what a Mecca for letterboxing!! Wish we'd had more time!) he bought his own stamp there (Grizzly Bear for the CAL bears UC Calif) and stamped along with me!
<br/>
<br/>Hope to someday get back to this area for a few dozen more! Meanwhile, we'll be planting some new ones in Northern California.
