bought and probably will always be because they just aren't as into it <br/>
as I am -- they go along to humor me and to use as blackmail to get me <br/>
to do things they want to do....<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to the "sport" and I had a store-bought stamp for the first two I found and then carved my own.  I'm one of those "researcher" types, so I knew what to expect.<br/>
<br/>
Midlandtrailblazer, I use the reverse tactic ... I bribe my kids to come with me in exchange for something they want to do.  Go with me to French Creek and I'll take you swimming ... go with me on the hike through the park and we'll stop by the skatepark for a while. Yesterday, I planted my first 3 boxes in a local park while hubby and older guy fished and littler guy helped me hide. After we hid, hubby and older guy "idiot-tested" our clues and found our boxes (with some revision of clues along the way). <br/>
<br/>
My younger son (7) loves boxing with me, but the 13 year old acts like it's torture.  He will come for the swimming and skateboarding, though, so I figure that's a big deal since a 13 year old usually wouldn't be caught dead with his mom!<br/>
<br/>
Even though it's blackmail, it's nice that we are all together, even if we're doing different things.<br/>
