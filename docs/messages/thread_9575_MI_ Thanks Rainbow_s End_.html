                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to say thanks to the Rainbow's End letterboxing team for <br/>
a couple of great boxes at Saugatuck Dunes State Park.  What gorgeous <br/>
trails in this park (despite the up and down climbs of the sand <br/>
dunes)!  Back in the trees the lake wind wasn't too bad and it was a <br/>
beautiful winter walk to the boxes today.<br/>
<br/>
The Birthday box is in great shape.  The First Letterbox on the Lake <br/>
was buried in snow but not doing too bad.  It could probably use a <br/>
large inner bag before the snow melts in the spring.  It was a bit <br/>
damp inside from condensation.  The small baggie the stamp was in had <br/>
some holes, so I replaced this, but I did not have a large bag with <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Also... my fingers were numb as I stood up on the hill at Birthday <br/>
box with the lake wind cutting right through to my bones...  It made <br/>
it hard to do the stamping and I messed up my signature stamp and <br/>
since there were a lot of empty pages in the log book, I figured I'd <br/>
just do another one and rip out the bad page and no one would be the <br/>
wiser...  Yeh, this would have worked had I, in my haste to put <br/>
everything back together and get my gloves back onto my numb fingers, <br/>
remembered to rip out the page(s).  Egg on my face...  Would <br/>
appreciate it if the next person to the box could dispose of the <br/>
badly stamped SpringChick image.  Thanks!<br/>
