addition to clues<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=13995&amp;boxname=On_The_Road_Again<br/>
there is also a real easy I-5 drive by at Yreka train museum. You can<br/>
throw a stone to the highway, pretty much, and it is real easy to<br/>
find. Although no one has notified us of that one yet<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=13997&amp;boxname=More_Beautiful_Than_Diamonds<br/>
<br/>
this is the link,<br/>
hope that one works. The stamp is outdoors, so even if it is closed<br/>
you can retrieve it. <br/>
<br/>
have fun<br/>
the following link is a real cool spot, <br/>
it isnt one of our letterboxes, but know the spot.<br/>
the clues for this one are awesome!!<br/>
it is a very short jaunt off the highway, very short, and lots of<br/>
history here <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=14245&amp;boxname=Applegate_Trail<br/>
<br/>
have fun!!!<br/>

He could have been there for all I know but I just reached in and felt for the <br/>

As for your Yreka box, we'll get that one on our annual jaunt to the Oregon <br/>
Shakespeare Festival in August. Will try to figure out the "Applegate Trail" <br/>
box at that time too.<br/>
