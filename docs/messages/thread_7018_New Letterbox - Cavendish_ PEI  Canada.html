Prince Edward Island, Canada<br/>
<br/>
Planted by "the Family"(Yuzi, CERK, VFTR, butterbaby, spunky spaniel, <br/>
and rtrw) on August 11th, 2002.  We planted this box while on<br/>
vacation so would appreciate any help keeping it going.  We will be <br/>
able to go back to check it only very occasionally.  thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Distance - about 30 steps<br/>
Time - 30 minutes, but that includes a tour of the museum<br/>
Difficulty - easy<br/>
<br/>
Cavendish Letterbox is located in on route 6 in Cavendish, Prince <br/>
Edward Island.  Lucy Maud Montgomery, the author of Anne of Green <br/>
Gables and 22 other books, is absolutely the star of this town. This <br/>
stamp was carved to look like Lucy Maud Montgomery's birthplace in <br/>
nearby New London.  You can decide for yourself how successful we<br/>
were in that when you see it:) <br/>
<br/>
We placed the box inside the Cavendish Post Office Museum which<br/>
shares a building with the post office and is right next door to the <br/>
Union Church.  It's a small enough town that you shouldn't have <br/>
trouble finding it.  The post office is located fairly close to her <br/>
childhood homesite.  The box is in the ice boat peril room directly <br/>
above passenger ticket #346<br/>
<br/>
The post office is open seasonally ONLY<br/>
m-f  9am to 5pm<br/>
sat  9am to 1pm<br/>
sun  1pm to 5pm<br/>
<br/>
The season runs from Victoria Day weekend through Canadian <br/>
Thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy our box.  If there's anything we need to know, or you'd just <br/>
like to chat, email us at rtrw@attbi.com<br/>
