                    <div class="plaintext-content">On June 15, 2002 Funhog placed the Rain Cloud Letterbox near Golden,<br/>
Jefferson County, CO. Huge forest fires were eating up the forests<br/>
Southwest of Denver while I was visiting. The sky was smoky and many of the<br/>
parks were closed. I left behind this rain cloud in the hopes that it might<br/>
bring some relief to the parched countryside. You will have wonderful views<br/>
of both the Red Rocks Amphitheater and the Denver Basin along this trail. <br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: Go west from Denver on I-70 to exit 259. Head South<br/>
toward Red Rocks Park. Across the road from the first park entrance go left<br/>
up Dinosaur Ridge. Just past the first switchback turn you will find a<br/>
turnout on the left side of the road at the Dakota Ridge Trail. Park here.<br/>
It will take about a half hour to reach the box.<br/>
<br/>
to the letterbox: The trail begins at a railroad tie retaining wall.<br/>
Shortly before you reach the highest point along this ridgeline begin<br/>
looking right for a woodpecker's handiwork. Thirty six steps beyond this<br/>
landmark the highway will be out of sight. Don't stub your toe! Going left<br/>
on a side trail twenty steps, you will find yourself standing between two<br/>
pines. The letterbox is to your right with a juniper as its neighbor and a<br/>
rock slab as its roof. Do a rain dance-<br/>
