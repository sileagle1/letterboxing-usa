I was at Shawnee Lookout This past weekend looking for our<br/>
first letterbox find. I ran into a Park Ranger as we were looking<br/>
in the weeds for a letterbox.  The Ranger told us that this is why<br/>
the park District was going to remove the letterbox because people<br/>
were killing the wild flowers searching for the boxs.<br/>
<br/>
Being new to Letterboxing, Could someone please tell me if<br/>
there is a problem in parks with letterboxing?  Is other parks<br/>
doing the same thing?<br/>
<br/>
We would love to know..<br/>

<div>I was contacted about removing the<br/>letterboxes from all of the Hamilton 
County Parks. I am not sure why the<br/>Park system is this way. 
<br/> <br/>   I thought the Park system was for use by everyone BUT 
I guess that just is not the case. I have over 140 Finds and I can only think of 
one time that I have ever see tracks going to a 
Letterbox.<br/> <br/>   Feel free to send them a

<div>I find this to be a surprising shift in 
attitude!  My family was introduced to letterboxing BY the Hamilton County 
Park District.  They ran a series of 5 boxes just this past (Gawd, is it 
really over already?) summer, one in each park, and gave a prize for finding all 
5 and bringing your logbook to the Sharon Centre, and showed it to the head 
naturalist.  They ran an ad in the Sunday paper, put out a special 
Activities flyer (also in the paper), and had a section on their website <a href="http://www.greatparks.ORG">http://www.greatparks.ORG</a>.  I think 
they were stopping the prize giving sometime in August.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We were unable to find the box in Farbach-Warner 
park, and asked at the Nature Barn.  The naturalist there, while getting 
ready for a butterfly garden tour in an hour or so, said that someone had found 
the box (again, placed there BY the Park District!), brought it to the Barn, and 
she asked us if we'd mind replacing it!  We told the naturalist at Sharon 
Centre about this when we'd filled our logbook, and she was delighted that we 
bothered to follow up with the staff at Farbach, but also concerned that the 
message about the boxes in the parks hadn't reached all the nature 
staff.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I, for one, definitely feel a message is in 
order!  This seems rather hypocritical to run a lbox series FOR THE PURPOSE 
of introducing letterboxing, and then asking boxers to pull their boxes from the 
park system.  If we lose the parks for placing boxes, where in the county 
CAN we box?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cincinnati Boxers:  I saved the Naturalist's 
card from the prize bag we got for completing her box series.  While I 
probably shouldn't post her name and phone number on the 'Net, if you'd like to 
join me in giving her  call, email me privately, and I'll provide her 
contact info.</div>
