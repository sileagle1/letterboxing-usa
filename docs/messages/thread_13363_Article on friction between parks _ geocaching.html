One of the interviewees in the article did later say that the reporter <br/>
heavily dramatized the supposed "friction" between parks officials and <br/>
cachers, and it's nice to know that some of the parks mentioned in the <br/>
article are supportive of the activity.<br/>

I realize it's not wise to generalize (how's that for poetry) but I believe that there is a different mind set for Geocachers and LBers. (I am probably starting a thread that will get a life of it's own). You know my poor experiences with a couple of geo guys , and the further we can separate ourselves from the other hobby the better. That's not to say there can be combinations if one wants it as" there are no rules". It is just that I believe letterboxing should stand on it's own. Don<br/>

Let's think about preserving our natural resources FOR the public, <br/>
instead of FROM the public.<br/>
<br/>
I think that idea about moving caches (and boxes) every year is a good <br/>
one. But if the trail to the box is over a durable surface (like rock) <br/>
it will hold up to traffic. We have to be careful not to disrupt the <br/>
habitat, but we can certianly enjoy our little "sport" without doing <br/>
that.  Thank goodness Connecticut officials mostly like letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
What I don't like about geocachers is what I read when I checked out <br/>
their site: posts about bushwacking straight to points, going off <br/>
trail, one guy even ripped out the suspension on his mini-van...how <br/>
smart is that? Another guy almost fell off a cliff in the dark -- too <br/>
busy watching his arrow and not his footing, when the clue stated it <br/>
was just off the edge of a cliff and not try for it when it's dark. <br/>
Duh.<br/>

My dear husband sees it as a way to weed idiots out of the gene pool. <br/>
If you are a SMART geocacher, then obviously, you'll survive just <br/>
fine.<br/>

There is good reason for that.  I have and do play both games but I have <br/>
noticed that even with clues and warnings SOME geocachers walk all around the <br/>
cache looking down at their gps unit.  They are not being purposefully destructive <br/>
but many park officials don't want the extra traffic.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do both letterboxing and geocaching.  I would say that letterboxers tend to put more thought and care into placing their boxes.  There is a work of art (and heart) that goes into every letterbox in the form of a stamp, usually custom made.  To lose that stamp would be a blow.  Even if the stamp is placed, the original is lost.<br/>
<br/>
With a geocache, there is no real personal loss if a box is stolen or thrown away by officials, gardeners, land-owners, etc. as the items in the geocache are not usually of great value anyway.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, most of the geocaches I have found aren't in places too different than from letterboxes.  Most of them are located close to trails or walkways.  I think that one of reasons that geocaching may be more 'destructive' than letterboxing is the sheer numbers of people that will go after a geocache.  There are more geocachers because it is a little easier to find something when you have the equivalent of 'X marks the spot' in the form of lat and lon coordinates.  There is also not as much of a personal commitment involved as you do not need a personal stamp when you find a cache.  All you need is a pen to sign the log and some Happy Meal toys to drop in the cache.  Even the items to place are optional as I usually just sign the log but don't take or leave anything.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this is also a generalization on my part as I have seen some nice 'I found your cache' stickers and calling cards.  There is even one couple that attaches a custom animal pin to each card they place in a found cache.  There are also some really, really innovative placements that will send a hunter to multiple locations to get to the final set of coordinates.<br/>
<br/>
The geocaching.com web site does emphasize 'Cache-In, Trash Out' encouraging geocachers to pick up litter along the way.  Some people even post pictures of the trash they picked up while they were finding a cache.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, as with any hobby/activity/sport there are a few boneheads and jerks that will ruin it for the rest of us.  I'm sorry that Don ran into some of those.  For the reasons stated above (ease of finding and little personal commitment) I think that geocaching does attract more of the abusive types who don't care what damage they do in their goal to rack up a high 'caches found' score than letterboxing does as letterboxing takes more time and skill (making a stamp) and processing power (deciphering the clues).<br/>
<br/>
To summarize, I have to agree with Don that it wouldn't be a horrible idea to keep the two sports separate but I am afraid that in the eyes of the general public who doesn't have experience in either they look the same: place something in a secret spot and give someone else clues to find it.<br/>

  Hi SD,<br/>
  I realize it's not wise to generalize (how's that for poetry) but I believe that there is a different mind set for Geocachers and LBers. (I am probably starting a thread that will get a life of it's own). You know my poor experiences with a couple of geo guys , and the further we can separate ourselves from the other hobby the better. That's not to say there can be combinations if one wants it as" there are no rules". It is just that I believe letterboxing should stand on it's own. Don<br/>

Be kind to the forest &amp; plant life .....<br/>
I have two letterboxes in a small park in Cincinnati. <br/>
I placed the boxes relatively close to the trails. <br/>
Now the park is temporally closed due to BULLDOZERS &amp; BACKHOES tearing a<br/>
huge new sewer line (?) through the park.!!<br/>
Can't win them all .<br/>
<br/>
I do try to step lightly ,and bring out cans,wrappers ,etc out when I am<br/>
letterboxing , ( or geocaching ).<br/>
<br/>
Did I save a National Forest from burning to the ground? <br/>
The most shocking thing I have ever seen was this group of  kids coming<br/>
out of a Gorge (Princess Arch) overlook trail (looking very stoned, and<br/>
snickering)<br/>
Dragging their sleeping bags at their sides almost running .  As they<br/>
passed we said hello....But after we got to the overlook there was a<br/>
good size FIRE burning out of control in a windy situation with leaves<br/>
stacked ready to go up in flames at any second. It took us almost an<br/>
hour to put the fire out cold.<br/>
What were these kids thinking ??<br/>

       How do you get such good  accuracy during your geocaching? My <br/>
Magellan GPS 315 only seems to get one in the general ball park area, <br/>
+/- 100ft or so. Suppose thats close enough. Wonder if the newer ones are<br/>
more accurate.  Got a lot to learn about these things.<br/>
<br/>
       Will be going to the  geocaching site to research  this stuff out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Really think that a mix of the two , with clues and coordinates ,<br/>
should be used in extreme cases.  Sometimes lbs may be placed in remote<br/>
and complicated terrains.<br/>
<br/>
        Just a thought from the "budster"<br/>

         Carrying around a GPS is kind of like having a camera when<br/>
others that are around don't know what you are up to.   Kind of makes you<br/>
look like you are "on a mission"  and everything is ok. What do you<br/>
