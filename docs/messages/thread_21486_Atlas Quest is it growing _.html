I like both Letterboxing.org and Atlas Quest for different reasons.  <br/>
Honestly though, I just never think about Atlas Quest.  I'll be the <br/>
first to admit, I should use it more.  It's a great site.<br/>

I prefer Atlas Quest because it is interactive and up to date. The <br/>
letterboxing.org site has alot of out of date information and <br/>
inacurate information and will probably never be an interactive <br/>
site. I still use it first to look for boxes because so many are <br/>
listed there, but Atlas Quest is still my #1 pick.<br/>

I agree with Liz.  AQ data is more easily user manipulated.  You can<br/>
see when a box was last reported found, record your finds so that it<br/>
will hide those and show the nearest to a box or city that you have<br/>
yet to find.  There are quite a few features I really like and use,<br/>
and plenty that I don't need.  But, I do always check letterboxing.org<br/>
to keep an eye on new clues.  AQ does get a tad bit slow sometimes<br/>
though.  Although lately it seems improved.  <br/>

AQ's trip planner is awsome! The only problem is that only 3 of 30 <br/>
possible boxes show up, for the trip I'm about to take, because they <br/>
aren't listed on AQ.  I'm going crazy trying to figure out what <br/>
boxes are gettable from the route I'm taking.  <br/>

in New Zealand, I much prefer AtlasQuest because of the unparalleled<br/>
international coverage. Ryan has also bent over backwards to accommodate my<br/>
every wish (well nearly every wish) and as a rough estimate I reckon we have<br/>
over 90% of NZ boxes listed in AQ, plus a trip planner for all the state<br/>
highways. <br/>
<br/>
I don't expect letterboxing.org to offer international coverage - after all<br/>
it is specifically targetted for North America. I used to include all my<br/>
non-NA boxes there but no longer bother because they're pretty much<br/>
impossible for anyone to find. I also didn't want the hassle of building my<br/>
own database, so I am more than a little appreciative of Ryan's efforts.<br/>

Both sites have good advantages.  I have listed my boxes on both so <br/>
they can be found by anyone.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with outdated information is that we don't have a <br/>
mechanism to purge out old information.  People will still plant <br/>
boxes, post clues, and then some time in the future they will loose <br/>
interest in the hobby.  The clues then will get stale.  AtlasQuest <br/>
is a newer database so there has not been enough time to accumulate <br/>
old information.  It will happen eventually.<br/>
