often the ones who ignore that warning.<br/>
Also, in this day and age I think everyone relies (heavily) on Google so I'm <br/>

Or maybe, until you get around to maitenance, putting a note in the clues<br/>
asking finders to check the address and take a marker or pen and scratch out<br/>
com and put in org.  That would work for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure there *is* alink to letterboxing.org on the letterboxing.com<br/>
website, but I don't know if muggles would see it thru everything else<br/>
that's on that site.<br/>

  Don't be so hard on yourself!  I'm sure we've all goofed up at least once in our excitement over planting a box.  I think that most visitors to your boxes will be Letterboxers, and those that aren't (shame on them) well, they'll get the point about it not being trash etc. At least you've guided them in the right direction to find out more about Letterboxing.  .org, .com.... as long as it relates to Letterboxing!!

You've received lots of great suggestions, but you could make it all <br/>
right another way, too.  :)<br/>
<br/>
The site www.letterbox.org is for sale.  I think the right thing to <br/>
do would be to buy the site, then set up and maintain a mirror site <br/>
for letterboxing.org.  Yes, it would involve acquisition costs and <br/>
maintenance costs in perpetuity, but don't you think that is "the <br/>
right thing" to do for those 56 children you orphaned out there?<br/>
<br/>
The sale site doesn't give a specific price for the domain, but it <br/>
does say, "Typical sale pricing starts at a minimum of $1,000 and <br/>
may exceed $25,000 for premium names."  I think you should do the <br/>
right thing and offer them $25,000 for the site because "letterbox" <br/>
is a very premium name.  Just ask the forum members if they think <br/>
the name isn't important.<br/>
<br/>
As an added bonus, you could sell email addresses: <br/>
your_name_here@letterbox.org as a redirect email service.  I think <br/>
people should pay $25/year for a personalized letterbox email <br/>
address.  You'll recoup your $25K investment in no time!<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>

there's a lot to get together correctly when putting that whole box together! <br/>
<br/>
My own frustration recently was in placing a neat box that I had to go back to (the <br/>
location) several times before it was truly ready to plant: First, I thought of the perfect <br/>
spot... it was a ways from my home, but I remembered the area. I planned to use magnets <br/>
because there was a neat metal sign that I wanted it at.  I got my box ready, went back to <br/>
plant it, and.... DOH! Magnets didn't work!!! Looked like metal to me!?! Must be <br/>
aluminum!? Anyway, back home again. Took awhile to figure out just how I should attach <br/>
it. Visited several stores for some sort of "waterproof" attachment. Back again.... the box <br/>
now ready but the COLOR now, in my opinion, is going make this box too obvious (white <br/>
plastic against black... no, no, no.) So, back home again -- and this often means several <br/>
more weeks as my 3 kids keep me from ever doing letterboxing daily, LOL -- to finally <br/>
settle on some cool paint that actually sticks well to plastic and will allow it to be more <br/>
"stealth."  I think I've got everything ready... so excited to finally get the darned thing <br/>
planted... and I actually go back twice because in the summer this park is so darned <br/>
crowded I couldn't set it up without being seen! Finally, FINALLY get it attached another <br/>
night ... the fit and everything is just perfect and I'm so pleased ... almost walking away <br/>
now... when I suddenly remember the FF certificate! It's not in the box; it's back home in a <br/>
cabinet because I made it so long ago for this box (mine are all unique for each box,) that <br/>
I've forgotten all about it! AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH!!!!! So today... maybe today.... if I don't <br/>
get in a car crash going over to this place once more... this box will actually, really and <br/>
truly, get planted and I hope I never have to see it again for a long, long time.<br/>
