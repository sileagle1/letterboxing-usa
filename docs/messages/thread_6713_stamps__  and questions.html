thing to carve has been the Mars Staedtler erasers, although larger <br/>
than pink or red erasers (1.5" x 3"), they are still limited in <br/>
size.  I like the pink Speedy-Stamp also but not the price.  <br/>
Yesterday I found another product made by Speedball, called Speedy-<br/>
Cut, which comes in 2.75" x 4.5" blocks for $2 at Hobby Lobby.  I <br/>
have not yet carved it, but the consistency feels creamy like the <br/>
Mars erasers.  I have also seen the PZ Cut mentioned by Don praised <br/>
on a few stamping sites.  Am interested to know how you fare with the <br/>
gaskets and if the material is suitable.<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of questions in regards to stamp carving perhaps one <br/>
of the more veteran carvers could help with:<br/>
<br/>
-  The Mars erasers are so thick, they make the stamp rather bulky.  <br/>
Do you par this down, and if so, what is the best way to ensure an <br/>
even trim?<br/>
-  I have been using an Xacto knife for carving.  I like the way it <br/>
handles, but it is difficult to get large white spaces carved <br/>
evenly.  Is there a good tool to use for undercutting large white <br/>
spaces?<br/>
-  What are people's feelings in regards to stamp size?  I see <br/>
several of the new boxes going out have been micro boxes so imagine <br/>
the stamp is quite small to fit.  I recently ran across a box with a <br/>
very large stamp -- as I am using a decent size sketch pad as my <br/>
journal, the image fit, but it would not have fit were a person using <br/>
a small sketch pad as their log.<br/>
--(last one ;-) What are your feelings about alternate materials for <br/>
the stamp?  I ran across a box and the stamp appeared to be made from <br/>
some kind of leading rather than carved from rubber.  It was a <br/>
beautiful stamp which appeared to be handmade, but it did not take <br/>
ink very well and even after several tries, I was not able to get a <br/>
crisp stamp.  It occurred to me later as I cleaned the silver stuff <br/>
off my hands that maybe I wasn't supposed to ink it and the silver <br/>
would make the imprint?  Not sure on this...<br/>
<br/>
An insight is much appreciated!  Thanks!<br/>

&gt; It's official... I've become obsessive-compulsive about carving <br/>
stamps.  I'm <br/>
&gt; loving it!<br/>
&gt; Here's the question...<br/>
&gt; I have found some pink material made by Speedball - I think it's <br/>
called <br/>
&gt; Speedy Stamp.  So far, it is my favorite thing to carve in.  <br/>
Erasers are <br/>
&gt; good, but they are slightly too small for me.  The problem with <br/>
Speedy Stamp <br/>
&gt; is that it is kind of expensive.  $6.00 for a piece that is about <br/>
3x6".<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone discovered anything cheaper and equally as good?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On one stamp carver's website, she suggested using sheets of <br/>
plumber's <br/>
&gt; gasket.  Does anyone know what this stuff is?  I spent a fruitless <br/>
half hour <br/>
&gt; wandering the aisles of Home Depot looking for it.  I just could <br/>
not bring <br/>
&gt; myself to ask the big burly home improvement guys for it for fear <br/>
they would <br/>
&gt; ask me what I needed for! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Are you doing some plumbing, ma'am?" <br/>
&gt; "Um... no, I'm carving rubber stamps so I can go hide them in the <br/>
woods.."  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was just not a conversation I wanted to have!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, anyways...<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions would be appreciated!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

To all, my &lt;grin&gt; accumulated "wisdom" LOL!

Yes, and portable!

Nice fine detail available from white vinyl - ask your local supplier about
Factis erasers, a bit larger but also pricey.
<blockquote type="CITE"><i><tt> like the pink Speedy-Stamp also but

Me too, be sure to<b> hone your blades, 400- 800 grit black
emery sandpaper </b>(hardware &amp; auto stores) works well.

Very crumbly to work with.  Only large detail achievable BUT the Prayer
Rock stamp is still working after several winters.  If you count the
number of failed stamps because they fall apart DURING carving, any other
product is more economical.
<blockquote type="CITE"><i><tt>I have also seen the PZ Cut mentioned by Don

OK, easier to carve, but I still like white vinyl (small) or red rubber
(large &amp; cheap) better.
<blockquote type="CITE"><i><tt>Am interested to know how you fare with the</tt></i>
<br/><i><tt>gaskets and if the material is suitable.</tt></i></blockquote>
SAND the face on 400 grit sandpaper on a flat surface.  Sandpaper
face up on the countertop and move the piece (face down) across it. 
Sometimes easier to do after it is mounted.  You may need to repair
the finest details.
<p>HONE your blades OFTEN!

I like speedball cutters available in a starter pack with a handle, several
blades and a sheet of pink stuff.  Also available separately. 
All art stores, most craft shops and Michaels carry these.  Additional
blades available in 2 packs.
<p>HONE your blades!

Artist's choice
<blockquote type="CITE"><i><tt>--(last one ;-) What are your feelings about

<br/><i><tt>the stamp?</tt></i></blockquote>
Artist' choice but if it is a self-inking stamp it would be useful to have
that noted.

<br/><i><tt>some kind of leading rather than carved from rubber.</tt></i></blockquote>
Haven't seen a handmade stamp such as you described - intriguing<b><i>.</i></b>
