That is great Barbi!  Congratulations on your find!  You should try<br/>
letterboxing.  It is similar to geocaching in some ways.  This e-mail list<br/>
is actually for and about letterboxing and not so much geocaching (hence,<br/>
the name).  You and the kids are certainly welcome in this community of<br/>
letterboxers &amp; we would enjoy hearing about your letterboxing activities!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>

Here's a good place to learn what LetterBoxing is all about:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/faq.html<br/>

Once you read that you'll be hooked on LetterBoxing too, and we'll look<br/>
forward to more posts from you about your LetterBoxing adventures!<br/>

&gt; Thanks Tom, I sure hope I didn't make an etiquette faux pas!  I didn't<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; that they are two different things.  Could you please explain the<br/>
difference<br/>
&gt; between geocaching and letterboxing?  Thank you, Barbi<br/>
