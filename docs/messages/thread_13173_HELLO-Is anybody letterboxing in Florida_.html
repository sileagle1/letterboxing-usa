time to plant them! Unfortunately, I just heard that my boxes in St. <br/>
Pete had gone missing! Bummer. Florida has always been a little slow <br/>
on the letterboxing side. Not many year-round residents have been <br/>
planting boxes. It's been folks down on vacation. So when the boxes <br/>
go missing, they stay missing. And there isn't that much growth. <br/>
I am in and out (my parents live in St. Pete) So I will try to make a <br/>
point of planting these boxes next time I am in town! <br/>

Hey!<br/>
I am an interested newbie in Jax, FL.  I was looking to see if I <br/>
could find someone in either south GA or the North FL area to come to <br/>
a geocachers meeting and talk about Letterboxing.  <br/>
Is there anyone out there that could help me?<br/>

When is this geocacher meeting?  Although I live in VA, I'll be in the <br/>

for a visit (OK, OK I admit it a letterboxing trip)  I also have to <br/>
eat at Clarks fish camp again.  I visited on business a little over a <br/>

Would that be too much of a drive from Brunswick?  I would hate to <br/>
ask you to drive way out of your way. <br/>
We are, however, very open on dates.  We are trying to fill up the <br/>
calendar for the remainder of the year. We usually meet on a Sat. <br/>
(generally the 3rd Sat of a month-- but that isn't set in stone)<br/>
I really want someone to speak on this. It is something I am <br/>
interested in. And I am thinking we could get some of the 20 or more <br/>
cachers in the area interested too!<br/>
Email me directly if you like and we can discuss details-- and see if <br/>
this is too far to go.<br/>
