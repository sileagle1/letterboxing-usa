I have tried to post these clues twice and got bounced both times. I<br/>
am doing something wrong and don't have a clue what it is.  So am<br/>
reverting to the old way and hope someone can correct me.  This old<br/>
one sometimes has a hard time with computers. !<br/>

HARK, ListeN to thE StrainS of summer music still floating on the<br/>
ocean breeze. <br/>
Daffodils may only be a beautiful memory, but the Lane is still there. <br/>
Turn your back to the Mansion and stroll past the Carriage House and<br/>
gardens that bloom in the summer. The green houses are but a glimmer<br/>

gardens. <br/>
When the paved Lanes come to a cross roads and you might see some of<br/>
the McCann clan around, continue straight on the Lane. The stone wall<br/>
on the right has three noticeably tumbled spots.  At the third tumble,<br/>
the first flat stones hide a prize<br/>
Happy Birthday , Music Woman.<br/>
And best wishes<br/>
