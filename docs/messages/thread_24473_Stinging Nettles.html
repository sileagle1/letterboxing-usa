Does anyone have any remedies for stinging nettles?  I know if you <br/>
crush the plant up and spread the juice on the "infected" area it's <br/>

Alternatively, wear long pants.  They also help against poison ivy, <br/>
thorns and ticks.  Great for bush whacking as well.<br/>

Curled Dock plants live in the same areas that Stinging Nettles do.<br/>
They are short, broad leafed plants that sort of look like overgrown<br/>
Dandelions, but without the flower part. If you pick of one of their<br/>
leaves and rub it on the affected area, you'll get a little relief.<br/>
Also, if you are close to home you can rub a paste of baking soda and<br/>
water on it, which should make you feel better.<br/>

opinion the crushing of jewel weed is the nugget of truth about <br/>
crushing the nettle.  I've never used crushed stinging nettle but it <br/>
seems to me akin to on purposely robbing poison ivy over yourself!<br/>
<br/>
Jewel weed is always found in the same area as stinging nettles.  I <br/>
learned this trick from my father and I grew up with a wooded <br/>
backyard.  I'd say 2 or 3 times a summer I'd have to do this trick.<br/>
<br/>
The crushed pulp, sticky sap of the jewel weed reminds me of Aloe.  <br/>
(the two plants look extremely different)<br/>

I just did a yahoo image search for jewel weed ... and well yes that's <br/>
what it looks like.<br/>

&gt; Recently I have dicovered that nettles like me. <br/>
&gt; REALLY like me.  They <br/>
&gt; are attracted to me like magnets!  If there is one<br/>
&gt; around I get it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you know of anything I can carry in my pack that<br/>
&gt; will relieve the <br/>
&gt; pain and make the blisters go away?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the help!<br/>
