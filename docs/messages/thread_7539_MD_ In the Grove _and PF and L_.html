located in a wonderful area, some sun, some shade and some <br/>
very tall undergrowth that the butterflies loved.  It was a bit<br/>
tricky  to find, but some estimation, and luck, paid off. This is an <br/>
area that we plan to visit again as the season's change.  And we <br/>
saw our first lizard!!  Thanks for the fun<br/>
