Mormon Island State Recreation Area<br/>
Grand Island NE<br/>
Hall County<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Located directly off I-80, Grand Island Exit #132<br/>
You need a park permit ($2.85 for a day) which you can pick up from the <br/>
rangers booth or the Phillips 66 station outside the park.  It is bike <br/>
friendly, pet friendly and family friendly.<br/>
<br/>
Located less than 1/4 of a mile from the exit ramps on the right hand side <br/>
of road.  The Mormon Island, is in fact not an island, but a set of small <br/>
lakes and rivers which create many little islands.  Used as a stopping <br/>
point for the Mormon Handcart travellers, the park is a good place for <br/>
fishing and camping and for easygoing nature walks.<br/>
<br/>
Once inside the park head for the RV/camping area. There will be a dirt <br/>
road headed east marked "Service Road", take this road headed east keeping <br/>
a lake on your left side until you come to the end of the lake, head north <br/>
along a fence, when the fence ends continue headed north along the bark <br/>
covered path, you will now be entering the tree cover.  Continue onward <br/>
until you reach a clearing with a handmade bench, next to a small reed <br/>
filled pond.  Across the pond will be a footbridge, cross and continue <br/>
heading north keeping the river on your left.  You will need to check the <br/>
river for a very large,bleached tree which has fallen and now spans half <br/>
the river.  From the foot of that tree, continue north along the trail for <br/>
150 to 200 ft.  Look on your right for a large pile of rotting tree limbs <br/>
and trunks.  The box is hidden inside the largest trunk.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This was my first box every planted, and I hope the directions are <br/>
okay.  This is a perfect place for travellers on i-80 to stop and camp out <br/>
or picnic.<br/>
