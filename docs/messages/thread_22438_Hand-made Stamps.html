                    <div class="plaintext-content">If I understand correctly, I can basically come up with a with a black and white <br/>
line design on my computer, reverse it image, print it on regular printer paper, <br/>
place it face down on a rubber surface such as a large eraser or stamp <br/>
making material, rub the paper with acetone *acetate?*  (nail polish remover) <br/>
and that should leave a good imprint on the material.  Then I would use an <br/>
Exacto knife to cut away everything that is not a part of the design.<br/>
<br/>
Is this about right?  Did I miss anything important?  Will what I just described <br/>
work?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, Where can I get a good-sized piece of suitable rubber material (about 3" <br/>
x 4")?  I can glue and mount it to a suitable piece of wood.  I just need the <br/>
material.<br/>

Thanks for all your help.<br/>

I've never used the acetone method... seems too complicated.  I either make a photo copy of the image, then iron it onto the carving medium, never really allowing the iron to stay on the medium more than a second at a time (my monster mash Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde box was done this way).  That way the carving medium won't melt onto the iron!  <br/>
<br/>
I also use a pencil transfer method on all of my simpler carvings (my Disney boxes use pencil transfer method).  THen turn it over onto the carving medium and rub with the back of my speedball tool (I find that fingers or erasers do not do as good a job as my carving tool), which transfers the pencil to the medium.  I find that this is easier than iron transfer, in that I can do it anywhere!  Carve at school, carve at work during breaks etc... ;-)<br/>

Acetone works only on laser copies and photocopies.  <br/>
<br/>
Inkjet ink is water based, and some people have success spritzing the<br/>
back of the image with water.  However, that can be tricky, and if<br/>
your rubber has a somewhat oily surface--many do--the image won't<br/>
transfer.<br/>
<br/>
Ironing gets mixed reviews among people who try it.  You'll either<br/>
love it or hate it, and it may vary with how fresh your original<br/>
images are, and the medium you're using for the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Pencil remains one of my favorite ways to transfer an image.  <br/>
<br/>
I like Speedball lino/block cutting tools for carving stamps, but<br/>
Xacto knives are also enormously popular.  If you can try both tools<br/>
in a class, you may find that one works great and the other feels<br/>
awkward.<br/>
<br/>
Just remember that you don't need to carve very deeply to remove enough rubber.<br/>
<br/>
I carve on everything from Speedball "pink stuff" and related<br/>
products, to Mars erasers, to... well, whatever looks like it might<br/>
hold an image.<br/>

I hope this helps!<br/>

Here's the simple test:<br/>
If the copier/printer takes a cartridge of TONER (powder) when being <br/>
refilled, ironing will transfer the image.<br/>
If the copier/printer takes INK (liquid), it will not transfer with <br/>
ironing.<br/>
