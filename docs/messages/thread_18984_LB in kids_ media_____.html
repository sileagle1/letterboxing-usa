                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funny story...... I've been out doing short hikes around here with my <br/>
daughter, looking for suitable places to plant boxes, though I never <br/>
mentioned the boxes to her. Today, she was asking about going hiking <br/>
again and I said I wanted her to help me keep an eye out for good <br/>
hiding places. When she asked why, I said I'd like to plant <br/>
letterboxes. As I started to explain it to her, she said, in that <br/>
excited tone that only 6-year-olds can muster, "I already *know* about <br/>
letterboxing, Mom!" Surprised, I asked her how....... "Ranger Rick told <br/>
me all about it"<br/>
<br/>
Turns out, the magazine has a comic strip with animals 'questing' for a <br/>
box using clues and a compass.<br/>
<br/>
June, 2004 magazine, if anyone is interested. I believe the story <br/>
started in the May issue, but that one has been read so much that it <br/>
has fallen apart. :-)<br/>

Box on!<br/>
