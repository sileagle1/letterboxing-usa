I just started letterboxing last November and out of 55 boxes that I've gone to, only one was missing.  I contacted the owner and they removed it from letterboxing website.  I've also seen where the planters of the boxes indicate that they have removed for repair.  Make sure when you go out of town that you get clues for several boxes in the same area.  You're chances of coming back with your logbook unstamped are slim.<br/>

heard from a finder.  <br/>
What isn't up to date, tho - and I've so far protested in vain - is <br/>
the shading-in of counties where the boxes are located.  When I'm <br/>
planning an auto trip, I like to examine the states involved to see <br/>
where letterboxes may lie along the route.  Few of us know the <br/>
location of counties other than in our home state, so it can be <br/>
difficult to zero in on the readily available boxes when this info is <br/>
incomplete.<br/>
Anyone else think this is important?  I'd volunteer (again)to lend a <br/>
hand in this task, if it were possible to parcel the work out.<br/>

I feel this is VERY important. Until last week I thought the shaded <br/>
map was the ONLY way to search for clues.<br/>
<br/>
I took a three-day trip at the beginning of the year to SW Miss. and <br/>
E La. to search for my first letterboxes. I made Baton Rogue my base <br/>
and took trips on circuits radiating from there. Last week I learned <br/>
that there were at least two letterboxes IN Baton Rogue at that <br/>
time, but I didn't know to look for them because I had only searched <br/>
using the map. One of those boxes is now missing. I feel I probably <br/>
would have had a more successful trip and got a stamp that I will <br/>
never be able to get now if the map had been up-to-date. I returned <br/>
from my trip with only one stamp to show for those three days.<br/>
<br/>
If the map is not going to be kept updated, I think it should be <br/>
removed from the site, or at least include a message saying that it <br/>
is not current and providing a link to the search application. New <br/>
hobbyists, such as myself, may be unaware of boxes in their area <br/>
because they think the map is current or the only way to search.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not trying to criticize the web masters; I think they have done <br/>
a good job of providing a forum to support the hobby. But I was <br/>
frustrated to learn that I had been right on top of at least two <br/>
boxes without knowing it. And it is something that new letterboxers <br/>
should be aware of.<br/>
