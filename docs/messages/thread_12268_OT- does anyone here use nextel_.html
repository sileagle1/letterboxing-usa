country areas, but most of the time we're less than 10 miles from I-<br/>
95 so its never a problem.  Don;t use the cellular as much as the <br/>
direct connect.  Most of the people I work with have them too and <br/>
haven't said much bad about them.  Our plans run $40 a month, we get <br/>
a discount b/c I am a municipal public safety employee which with <br/>
the discount and then taxes runs about 80-84 a month for 2 phones <br/>
and a load of cellular and D/C minutes.<br/>
