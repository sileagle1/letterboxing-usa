The "Austin Anteater" letterbox is located near the "Box of Ants" <br/>
letterbox.  You will need to use the ten clues for that box first, <br/>
then continue on to the Anteater.  <br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
Use "Box of Ants" clues.  I did not what to ruin it for this other <br/>
box.  Took me awhile to figure out.  Good luck.<br/>

<br/>
Eager to add stamps to our collection, we've managed to find and <br/>
stamp Babybear's recent Austin area additions. They are all in good <br/>
shape, though it's not certain how well a couple of the containers <br/>
will fare over time (we suspect they may need to be upgraded to <br/>
something more durable after a year or so in the elements).<br/>
<br/>
We had a blast finding them- especially "Poison Ivy". We know this <br/>
location very well (we were the first to find Eoghan's O-ring series <br/>
in the same park). As we came up to the familiar orienteering marker <br/>
in the clue, there was a middle-aged couple poking around the marker <br/>
and scoping the rocks behind it.<br/>
<br/>
We were sure we had come just minutes too late to be the first <br/>
letterboxers to claim it. They were acting a little oddly and by the <br/>
time we approached the marker with our dogs barking (the literal four-<br/>
legged variety, not our feet) I decided to ask the couple <br/>
enigmatically if the were "looking for poison ivy".<br/>
<br/>
They said they were not (and I'm sure assumed *we* were the strange <br/>
ones to ask such a stupid question) and carried on with their <br/>
conversation to eachother making it clear they wanted nothing to do <br/>
with this crazy party of four humans nor their two barking dogs, <br/>
rucksacks and water bottles.<br/>
<br/>
We moved down the path to wait for them to find and stamp the box- we <br/>
were sure they were, in fact, looking for poison ivy, the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
A few minutes later we ventured back to the location and soon found <br/>
the box at a spot directly under the previous visitors' feet. Opening <br/>
the logbook, we fully expected to see other stamps ahead of ours, but <br/>
it was blank- we were the first to mark it.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it's fun to be the first to stamp a box, but of course, you <br/>
miss out on seeing all the stamps of those who came before you. We're <br/>
hoping that as letterboxing picks up in Central Texas, we'll be less <br/>
and less likely to be the first to these boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly, that's a good thing. We were wondering how the rest of the <br/>
letterboxers on the list felt about being first to a box... big deal <br/>
or slight disappointment?<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting! More Mattke Family boxes coming soon- it's going to be <br/>
a busy 2003...<br/>
