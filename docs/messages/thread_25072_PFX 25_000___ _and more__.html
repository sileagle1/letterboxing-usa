Well, to many of the regular letterboxers in southern New England, this is probably old news by now, but I just wanted to let folks in some other parts of the country know that I reached PFX 25,000 on Thursday, May 28th at "Off The Beaten Path" in Shrewsbury, MA!  The previous couple of months, after trips to CA/NV/AZ and TX, had involved some fairly intensive letterboxing, hiking and traveling on my own, from snowy days in the Smokies to 4 days in a row reaching 90+ degree temps, including at least one 100+ box day during that very hot spell in VA!   Then, of course, after I got home, Pete kept me going, even when I was ready to drop, with lots of new plants within a 100-mile or so radius  of RI, so I was quickly able to reach PFX 25,000 even on a rainy afternoon after just having had oral surgery by doing a bunch of box hunts at a few local libraries! <br/>
<br/>
At any rate, one thing I was really impressed with on my last trip down south was the proliferation of plants by "letterboxing couples" - folks like Rottie Love and Kevin in VA, Doug &amp; Denise N10EC, and By His Grace and her hubby in TN, who seem to take turns planting and share a more equal interest in letterbox hunting and planting than many of the couples we've met in other parts of the country, where one member is often far more interested in letterboxing than the other.  One of my favorite memories of this last trip, however, is bound to be that of reconnecting with my old backpacking friend "Jumpstart", so called because he began his first AT thru-hike in the mid 80s by parachuting onto Springer Mountain in his late 60s!  Well, after some 400 successful parachute jumps and a couple more completed AT and PCT treks, he just last year, in his late 80s, fell out of a tree and broke a whole bunch of bones.  Since so many of the boxes in his area are "drive-bys", including one where he used to work for many years, I though I'd try taking him out letterboxing to a few of them, and - guess what - he liked it!  So, now I'm pleased to say that Robie and his wife Lana are now only the second (after myself) "radical repeater/multitrail thru-hikers" ever to join the ranks of letterboxers!  (I'm still working on recruiting another fellow "triple crowner/radical repeater", but that could take awhile! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was great to see the strong hold letterboxing has taken taken all up and down the AT corridor, and how many folks are getting back to our hobby's "hiking roots" from that first ever North American letterbox planted on Max Patch along the AT near Hot Springs, NC on April 26, 1998! ( not to forget the first ever "drive-by" planted at Prayer Rock in VT just a few days later!) It is so wonderful to see this trend - the return to the hunt, the original heart and soul of letterboxing  - taking hold even at some of the recent gatherings we have been attending, where fewer and fewer people just hang around the tables doing stamping, while more and more get out on the trails for those real "treasure hunts" - hurray!  We're also thrilled to see the Mansfield area of CT making a real comeback as America's original letterboxing hot spot with a great new series of carvings from around the country representing the 50 states, each apparently on a hike of about a mile or so, which is getting back to what letterboxing in these parts used to be like - kudos to everyone involved in that great America the Beautiful project!<br/>
<br/>
So, now June is supposedly my "rest month" before getting ready for some more mountain adventures later this summer.  We're happy to report, however, that the historic LbNA F500 box, after having disappeared for several years, is back in operation, and we are once again accepting photos to put into it from anyone who reaches that milestone.  Our PFX clubs ( http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html ) are also still open to anyone who wants to send us their names and dates for reaching a particular milestone, and we are pleased to congratulate such recent additions as Magical Music Man for PFX  500, The Seekers of NC and Sparky Butterfly of CT for F 1000, and Oldhounder and Siamese of MA for PFX 5000!!!  Congrats to all who are having so much fun with our delightful hobby!<br/>

Well, I guess I  just still must be moving faster than some people do in those "o-races", putting in A LOT more hours and A LOT more miles (and there were plenty of witnesses to see that I didn't have any trouble resealing those ziplocks or rehiding those boxes carefully either!!!:-) Thanks, Rottie Love, Kevin, and everyone else involved for a wonderful day at Holliday Lake, and thanks to folks all around the country who continue to plant such an amazing array of boxes for us all to find "in record time"! <br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me - I recently went on record saying that I wanted to find as many letterboxes over the course of ten years as the number of miles that I put in during the course of my long ago "backpacking career" - that is, over 25,000!!! (5 AT's, 3 PCT's, CDT, and many many more trails too numerous to mention right now!) Well, even though it's been many years now since I've been able to backpack or do the type of hiking I used to, I do still hope to be able to plant a series to commemorate those old backpacking days called "OTTIE"  ("Oh, The Trails I've Enjoyed" - or "Endured", as the case may be!:-), when I reach that "shared backpacking miles and  letterboxing finds" goal (25,000 miles/25,000 boxes) in just a couple more thousand box searches! <br/>
<br/>
And speaking of box counts, I was just recently joking with someone about "putting in more miles of hiking doing letterbox hunts than God himself"! Most folks probably know that refers to the "old timer" Godfrey called "God", famous among English letterboxers for amassing, over a relatively small area in England, perhaps some 50,000 STAMPS over 7 decades, starting way back in 1935! Well, from what we've heard regarding some English letterboxing styles (scavenging, pub handouts, and "suitcase stamp swaps"), I think it would be accurate to say that even in less than ONE decade, I've already managed to find almost half as many stamps by doing "REAL North American-style letterbox HUNTS",  so we should all be proud of the tremendous progress that letterboxing has made here in this country in such a remarkably short time to make such an accomplishment possible!  And, of course, there's no question that I've ALREADY put in far more hiking miles than anyone else, for in addition to my backpacking miles from the 80's and 90's, I 'd done at least double that in just plain hiking miles even before I ever started letterboxing! Even in these much slower hiking years of late, I still can't imagine anyone working harder at going out letterboxing on a continual basis than I have, so I hope others can be proud of my record, just as I am proud and grateful for all the wonderful accomplishments of North American letterboxing in general! <br/>

(oh, how can I resist ;-))<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Well, I guess I  just still must be moving faster than some people do in those "o-races", <br/>
 &gt; putting in A LOT more hours and A LOT more miles (and there were <br/>
plenty of witnesses<br/>
<br/>
It is rare to find 100 controls in an O race, tho I have done it (albeit<br/>
under contrived circumstances).  I hope you don't think I was doubting<br/>
your claim.  It is clearly possible to cover that much terrain in that<br/>
time frame; that is beyond doubt.  I certainly don't see any hints of<br/>
doubt in my original post.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in O, it generally takes less than a second to process a control<br/>
(slightly longer in the 24 hour formats), but also in O, the controls<br/>
are considered commodity items, intended to be processed as fast as<br/>
possible, as they are an artefact of the competition rather than the<br/>
point of it.  In letterboxing, it really does take me forever to process<br/>
a box (I have fat, stubby fingers and just hate those ziplocs that don't<br/>
have that slidey thing, and then to get the air out once they are sealed<br/>
is another hassle), but more to the point it is fun to sift thru the<br/>
logbook looking for hidden this or hidden that, or more fun, placing<br/>
hidden this or hidden that, reading the comments, whatever.  It<br/>
probably takes me about 2-4 minutes to process a box.  So, clearly,<br/>
I could still get it done on a mere 10 minute mile pace, assuming<br/>
the terrain isn't too rugged.  I personally never thought of<br/>
letterboxing as that sort of sport tho.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Well, from what we've heard regarding some English letterboxing styles <br/>
 &gt; (scavenging, pub handouts, and "suitcase stamp swaps"),<br/>
<br/>
Seen plenty of that on this side of the pond as well.  Not that it<br/>
matters, a box is a box, right?  A control is a control.  I'm not<br/>
coming from a position of doubting the evidence of commodization, but<br/>
I am wondering why it matters.  Looks like the line is drawn somewhere<br/>
near 'boxes I've found', not of the type that that 'God' dude found.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I think it would be accurate to say that even in less than ONE decade, <br/>
 &gt; I've already managed to find almost half as many stamps by doing "REAL<br/>
 &gt; North American-style letterbox HUNTS",<br/>
<br/>
Now, this is actually interesting.  Is this term defined on AQ?<br/>
Again, I'm interested in line drawing between 15 minute hikes and<br/>
pub letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; so we should all be proud of the tremendous progress that letterboxing has <br/>
 &gt; made here in this country in such a remarkably short time<br/>
<br/>
But we all aren't.  "Progress" isn't the word I would use.  Progress<br/>
implies 'movement towards a beneficial goal or direction' or words<br/>
to that effect.  I think it is one of the most misused words around.<br/>
My favorite example is "evolutionary progress" that some laypeople<br/>
who don't understand the science of evolution use sometimes.  But,<br/>
I don't want to go too far off-topic.<br/>
<br/>
I might instead use the words "massive increase in quantity", or, again,<br/>
"commodization", that makes such accomplishments possible, and differing<br/>
folks can have differing views on the "beneficial" nature of such (I'm<br/>
of the camp that it is detrimental, but that is just my opinion which I<br/>
impose on no one else).<br/>
<br/>
I will however, admit that having just spent 45 hours (and some<br/>
pretty painful hours, some were) developing a clue (and that is<br/>
typical; I've spent much longer in the past), that to think the goal<br/>
is to whip thru it spending all of 15 minutes on it and processing it<br/>
as fast as possible is a bit deflating (as an interesting aside, were<br/>
I to have my amateur economist's hat on right now, I might use the<br/>
term "inflating", as in the concept of printing lots of things to<br/>
inflate away massive things (like your gov't, if you are an American,<br/>
is doing right now, and, which if it doesn't work, is going to make<br/>
last year's panic look like a walk in the park).  But again, off topic.<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; there's no question that I've ALREADY put in far more hiking miles<br/>
&gt; than anyone else, for in addition to my backpacking miles from the<br/>
 &gt; 80's and 90's, I 'd done at least double that in just plain hiking<br/>
 &gt; miles even before I<br/>
<br/>
Interesting that I just recently pulled a AT thru-hiker off the<br/>
mountain, and gave her a ride to town.  It got me thinking alot<br/>
about trail culture recently, yet I guess these comments indicate<br/>
I have less of an understanding than I thought; viz. I was under the<br/>
impression that this sort of competitive aspect was absolutely taboo<br/>
in the hiking world, more suited, well, for O races.  But, WDIK?<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; I still can't imagine anyone working harder at going out letterboxing<br/>
 &gt; on a continual basis than I have,<br/>
<br/>
No, I couldn't either.  I wonder if I work harder at creating clues<br/>
than anyone else?  I don't know, never thought about all that much<br/>
(but after 45 hours, I've thought it a little lately, especially<br/>
knowing the number of groups that will look for it can probably be<br/>
counted on one hand).  I certainly wouldn't think it boastworthy<br/>
were there some way to quantify it, tho.  But, IMHO, art cannot be<br/>
quantified (such that we are pretentious to think of what we do as<br/>
art, but I know some what others do really is).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this may be more of big fish in a small pond syndrome.  Clearly<br/>
the movement required for a 15 minute/box pace is on the scale of AR<br/>
or O (assuming that the boxes are not contrived to be three meters<br/>
apart, and that is a given based on "real hunts" or words to that<br/>
effect), and I imagine those interested in that pace are in those sports<br/>
already.  Were one to compete in those sports, I'd bet one would find<br/>
lots of hardworking people, some, perhaps, that would blow that pace<br/>
away, and, were they interested in letterboxing and recruited thusly,<br/>
blow these paces away as well.  (An interesting experiment was done in<br/>
the American O scene, which includes alot of genuinely hard-working<br/>
athletes.  A rich man recruited a high-schooler who did not know what<br/>
O was, and had only two requirements: good grades and on the HS XC<br/>
teem.  Within 2 years was competing with the best in the country<br/>
and missed the World Champs team on a mere non-sporting technicality.<br/>
Goes to show there is probably something to this concept).<br/>
<br/>
As for working hard, there are people on this planet who hit golf<br/>
balls 8 hours a day (I personally can't imagine anything more tedious),<br/>
an activity that produces no economic benefit or common good for<br/>
anyone, and they are multi-millionaires, and people who toil in<br/>
fields for 16 hours a day, and are destitute (well, that may be more<br/>
tedious). So, who is working harder?  Does it matter?  I would argue<br/>
that the person toiling is working harder, as I would measure work<br/>
based on calorie expenditure, not on perceived "value" or "boastability"<br/>
of the work.<br/>
<br/>
Now, why would I write such a post.  Clearly, I will be flamed.  Fans of<br/>
Ayn Rand might even accuse it of being 'Tooyism'.  But, I am not<br/>
motivated by either of those things, and neither is the point.  I<br/>
like to write.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, while I had no problem with the first post, and my comment<br/>
about the 15 minute pace was pretty much at face value (I recently<br/>
really did have quite a tussle with an ornery ziploc), I am not the<br/>
biggest fan of boasting, and do feel the post I am responding to is<br/>
a touch over the top.  I agree with the thru-hiker that this is not a<br/>
competitive domain.  There are plenty of other domain -- I'll go one<br/>
on one in a 24 hour O race anyday, name the place and time.  I think<br/>
you are competing with, well, no one.  I, speaking for myself only,<br/>
simply don't want to, despite having the requisite resources, fitness,<br/>
and clue solving skill.  And, while the first post didn't so much, the<br/>
second one clearly came across as competitive.  Ok, you win.  Lets<br/>
play hearts now (and again, I will assure a different outcome :))<br/>
<br/>
But, more importantly than PFX competitions, there are serious points<br/>
I like to make time to time about letterboxing, life, etc., just to<br/>
offer some perspective, a different angle, etc (that of course have<br/>
been made 50 billion times before, but what isn't derivative?).  Its<br/>
all harmless and in good fun, get the list riled sometimes, and<br/>
thats the point.  FWIW.  When someone boasts, its always nice to offer<br/>
a white-hot spotlight.  It strengthens the boast in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
And yeah, it is deflating to work 45 hours on something for a<br/>
commodity activity.  Posts like these are the results, as is less<br/>
work on my part :)  I wonder if others care that their hard work<br/>
on boxes are being treated to be blown thru like commodities, as<br/>
fast as humanly possible?  I wonder why I do?  It will pass.  I'll<br/>
just do something else that is more meaningful.<br/>
<br/>

Surely the finder was moving at a much faster pace than you gave her credit for!  So, the result was 100 boxes in a day.  Let's assume the first box was found at 6am and the last one at 10pm.  That gives us 16 solid hours of letterboxing.... or 960 minutes... or one box every 9 minutes, 36 seconds.

&gt; Now, really.  How can you say your comment about the 15 minute <br/>
 &gt; pace was at face value?<br/>
<br/>
I assumed a full 24 hours of hunting, or 24*60/100 = 14.4 min/box<br/>
over the 24 hour period.  It really doesn't matter, exactly, for the<br/>
points I was attempting to make.<br/>
<br/>
I'll admit that a 9-10 minute per box pace does start to strain my<br/>
credulity under the premise of "real hunts", that, as yet, undefined<br/>
term, which I am construing loosely as "something other than a<br/>
contrived hunt", or at least 90 of the boxes in question were listed<br/>
on a bona fide letterboxing-related web site beforehand and somewhere<br/>
in terrain and not in a pub setting, etc.<br/>
<br/>
15 minutes, yeah, 9 minutes, well, not so sure on that one, that is<br/>
some amazing density, but I'm no expert on these things, that's for<br/>
sure!<br/>

Well, frankly I'm relieved to hear it. Having enjoyed considerable time (in some cases, several years) spent in solving your clues, it would be distressing to think that the fun you had in creating them lasted only 15 minutes each! ;-)<br/>

&gt; Really. A box every 14 and half minutes, on average, is<br/>

Well, I guess I just still must be moving faster than some people do in those "o-races", putting in A LOT more hours and A LOT more miles (and there were plenty of witnesses to see that I didn't have any trouble resealing those ziplocks or rehiding those boxes carefully either!!!:-) Thanks, Rottie Love, Kevin, and everyone else involved for a wonderful day at Holliday Lake, and thanks to folks all around the country who continue to plant such an amazing array of boxes for us all to find "in record time"! <br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me - I recently went on record saying that I wanted to find as many letterboxes over the course of ten years as the number of miles that I put in during the course of my long ago "backpacking career" - that is, over 25,000!!! (5 AT's, 3 PCT's, CDT, and many many more trails too numerous to mention right now!) Well, even though it's been many years now since I've been able to backpack or do the type of hiking I used to, I do still hope to be able to plant a series to commemorate those old backpacking days called "OTTIE" ("Oh, The Trails I've Enjoyed" - or "Endured", as the case may be!:-), when I reach that "shared backpacking miles and letterboxing finds" goal (25,000 miles/25,000 boxes) in just a couple more thousand box searches! <br/>
<br/>
And speaking of box counts, I was just recently joking with someone about "putting in more miles of hiking doing letterbox hunts than God himself"! Most folks probably know that refers to the "old timer" Godfrey called "God", famous among English letterboxers for amassing, over a relatively small area in England, perhaps some 50,000 STAMPS over 7 decades, starting way back in 1935! Well, from what we've heard regarding some English letterboxing styles (scavenging, pub handouts, and "suitcase stamp swaps"), I think it would be accurate to say that even in less than ONE decade, I've already managed to find almost half as many stamps by doing "REAL North American-style letterbox HUNTS", so we should all be proud of the tremendous progress that letterboxing has made here in this country in such a remarkably short time to make such an accomplishment possible! And, of course, there's no question that I've ALREADY put in far more hiking miles than anyone else,<br/>
 for in addition to my backpacking miles from the 80's and 90's, I 'd done at least double that in just plain hiking miles even before I ever started letterboxing! Even in these much slower hiking years of late, I still can't imagine anyone working harder at going out letterboxing on a continual basis than I have, so I hope others can be proud of my record, just as I am proud and grateful for all the wonderful accomplishments of North American letterboxing in general! <br/>
Thanks and cheers,<br/>

Well, to many of the regular letterboxers in southern New England, this is probably old news by now, but I just wanted to let folks in some other parts of the country know that I reached PFX 25,000 on Thursday, May 28th at "Off The Beaten Path" in Shrewsbury, MA!  The previous couple of months, after trips to CA/NV/AZ and TX, had involved some fairly intensive letterboxing, hiking and traveling on my own, from snowy days in the Smokies to 4 days in a row reaching 90+ degree temps, including at least one 100+ box day during that very hot spell in VA!   Then, of course, after I got home, Pete kept me going, even when I was ready to drop, with lots of new plants within a 100-mile or so radius  of RI, so I was quickly able to reach PFX 25,000 even on a rainy afternoon after just having had oral surgery by doing a bunch of box hunts at a few local libraries! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, one thing I was really impressed with on my last trip down south was the proliferation of plants by "letterboxing couples" - folks like Rottie Love and Kevin in VA, Doug &amp; Denise N10EC, and By His Grace and her hubby in TN, who seem to take turns planting and share a more equal interest in letterbox hunting and planting than many of the couples we've met in other parts of the country, where one member is often far more interested in letterboxing than the other.  One of my favorite memories of this last trip, however, is bound to be that of reconnecting with my old backpacking friend "Jumpstart", so called because he began his first AT thru-hike in the mid 80s by parachuting onto Springer Mountain in his late 60s!  Well, after some 400 successful parachute jumps and a couple more completed AT and PCT treks, he just last year, in his late 80s, fell out of a tree and broke a whole bunch of bones.  Since so many of the boxes in his area are<br/>
 "drive-bys", including one where he used to work for many years, I though I'd try taking him out letterboxing to a few of them, and - guess what - he liked it!  So, now I'm pleased to say that Robie and his wife Lana are now only the second (after myself) "radical repeater/multitrail thru-hikers" ever to join the ranks of letterboxers!  (I'm still working on recruiting another fellow "triple crowner/radical repeater", but that could take awhile! :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was great to see the strong hold letterboxing has taken taken all up and down the AT corridor, and how many folks are getting back to our hobby's "hiking roots" from that first ever North American letterbox planted on Max Patch along the AT near Hot Springs, NC on April 26, 1998! ( not to forget the first ever "drive-by" planted at Prayer Rock in VT just a few days later!) It is so wonderful to see this trend - the return to the hunt, the original heart and soul of letterboxing  - taking hold even at some of the recent gatherings we have been attending, where fewer and fewer people just hang around the tables doing stamping, while more and more get out on the trails for those real "treasure hunts" - hurray!  We're also thrilled to see the Mansfield area of CT making a real comeback as America's original letterboxing hot spot with a great new series of carvings from around the country representing the 50 states, each apparently on a hike of<br/>
 about a mile or so, which is getting back to what letterboxing in these parts used to be like - kudos to everyone involved in that great America the Beautiful project!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, now June is supposedly my "rest month" before getting ready for some more mountain adventures later this summer.  We're happy to report, however, that the historic LbNA F500 box, after having disappeared for several years, is back in operation, and we are once again accepting photos to put into it from anyone who reaches that milestone.  Our PFX clubs ( http://alum. wpi.edu/~ p_miner/Letterbo xes.html ) are also still open to anyone who wants to send us their names and dates for reaching a particular milestone, and we are pleased to congratulate such recent additions as Magical Music Man for PFX  500, The Seekers of NC and Sparky Butterfly of CT for F 1000, and Oldhounder and Siamese of MA for PFX 5000!!!  Congrats to all who are having so much fun with our delightful hobby!<br/>

Oh, it's so interesting to see all the different personality types involved in this hobby, too: the sweet, the gracious, the jealous, the pugnacious!  Oh, how many different revealing types of responses one can get just from sharing one's joy about one particularly hot and happy day... or whole bunches of them...it just makes me chuckle thinking about it!!! Oh, did I forget to say that my recent VA 100+ box day was also a gathering day, which I just happened to decide to attend at the very last moment because I knew I wasn't going to be able to get back far enough north in time to go looking for a "mapsurfer box" or some such thing with Lightnin' Bug and Pink Panther in PA that day, as originally planned? And, oh, did I fail, as usual, to mention that I was the first, and at some perhaps the only finder that day, of many of the boxes I found in that lovely big park around the lake, so I didn't have to take time to stop and read every entry the way I usually like to do?  And, oh, did I neglect to say that many of those boxes had  hitchhikers in them (like those old "evil ones"), and, that going by those old "mapsurfer guidelines" (although not by the more recent AQ separation of categories), hitchikers actually count as finds? And, oh, did I not add that I could have found even more boxes that day had I continued on to the "official night boxing" over at the farm, but I opted instead to do my own version of nightboxing just so that I could find every single box that was then in the park, plus a few outside the park as well, which really did take me quite a few hours in the dark! Oh, I could go on and on, but it's just too funny thinking that some folks could get themselves so worked up trying to figure out how many minutes it took me to find each box that they missed the whole point - that I was just grateful for being able to do what I did that day, and that I simply had a blast!!! (as I do on most every letterbox day, however big or small!) My quip about "o-races" was meant merely as a joke for Randy to consider the possibility that, despite my own personal feelings of inadequacy about my current state of "decrepitude" (which I, of course, expected him to share - I know, "low self esteem"!), there might somehow be someone in orienteering I could actually still be faster than! I know next to nothing about "o-racing", nor have I any interest in it (other than if a signpost were to help me find a letterbox!:-), so it never even occurred to me that Randy could possibly take my quip as a personal challenge to Himself!  O, how things can get misinterpreted!  And, oh, the "male ego"! (this is just another light-hearted jab at Randy, in case he can't tell! :-), but it really does seem to me that he just has a case of "sour grapes" because, with all the other terrific boxes now available in beautiful places all around the country, we just no longer have much vested interest in going looking for particular boxes as we did when they were practically the "only act in town" (although I do have to admit we were a bit intrigued by the recent piquant travel tales of a certain investigator!;) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I really do think that some people take themselves far too seriously sometimes, myself included. Just as my backpacking days meant so much to me because I was recovering from a fractured spine and it just astounded me that I could do it at all, and therefore made a point of counting every backpacking mile, so, too, now with letterboxing I stay focused on counting my finds because it just means so much to me that I can still keep myself going that way sometimes in spite of the bouts of fibromyalgia, PTSD, and other problems.  However, it should go without saying that if it were just about the numbers and that I didn't really still love so many aspects of this hobby, I would have quit long ago!  And as much as I love the idea that letterboxing, like backpacking, is essentially a private noncompetitive undertaking ( that's actually why I chose them both!), and I basically boycott those activities (road rallies, geocaching contests and such)  that encourage "racing" (other than simply to stretch toward reaching one's own personal goals), I suppose it would be just as naive of anyone to maintain that letterboxing has no experience levels as it would be to insist that there is no distinction between "weekend warriors", " thru-hikers", "radical repeaters" and "triple crowners" in the backpacking world. (And the thought of Randy "pulling" a woman off the AT is, of course, absolutely terrifying! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we set up our PFX clubs to acknowledge the hard work most people do to reach particular letterboxing levels, once again sort of following "mapsurfer guidelines", suggesting that we set the next rung  - (after F500, for which Randy even initiated a special box!) - at F2500 - "to give others the chance to catch up"! (Yup, it's in the archives! hmm..sounds a bit more "competitive-oriented" than"acknowledgement-oriented" to us, Randy!:- ) Anyway, quite a few folks wanted an intermediary step of F1000 to gauge their progress, so we gladly complied, and we're  happy to see that the system has worked quite well. Of course, some of the newer folks may prefer those AQ "Halls of Fame", which don't, as far as I know, give dates for any sort of historical context. In any case, though, some people nowadays could do 500 local "drive-bys" (yes, it's imperative to focus on that verbal aspect!;-) and still get the same "credit" as someone doing big hikes all around the country, but who cares?  Whatever a person wants to get out of the hobby is up to that individual, and I don't feel like I'm boasting if I want to share my joy about getting such a lot out of this hobby in so many different ways and accomplishing something that just a few years back I wouldn't have even thought possible! I guess I can understand how that might be upsetting, though, to some folks with even lower self esteem than I have, but that's more of a reflection on them than on me, and perhaps includes those who think that only they should be allowed to brag about what boxes they've found or that only what they have to say matters, those who desire instant gratification without putting in the time and effort of working their way up the ladder, and those seemingly inherently so full of themselves and their own superiority that they refuse to acknowledge that any ladder even exists because they are already simply the "best"! These are the folks I personally have the most trouble with, the narcissists, whereas, I happen to be at the other end of the spectrum, always thinking that no matter how much I do, it's never going to be good enough to please that "witch of an inner critic", and that I'll never find enough boxes to gain acceptance from the "letterboxing demons"! So now I just have to say thanks again, not only to the planters who keep me striving to at least try to be that "good enough letterboxer", who could finally find enough boxes to appease those horrible demons (probably never happen!), but especially to those folks with such high self esteem that they could actually "ego-afford" to be happy for me and congratulate me rather than just trying to find ways to shut me up or put me down! Oh, you wonderful, wonderful people - you'll probably never know just how much that has meant to me!  Now maybe I  actually can take a little break and rest in peace, at least for a little while....Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!!!!<br/>

Well, Wanda, yes, I guess you did forget to mention some of those things! I think people were thrown by the fact that after you joked about being fast, most of the rest of your post had to deal with how you were doing actual "hunts" in contrast to English pub boxes. Glad you've cleared that up.<br/>
<br/>
Still an interesting discussion to be had on whether the "gotta get 'em all" philosophy is beneficial or detrimental to the hobby, I think, but not for me right now (stupid work...).<br/>

 Congratulations on a game well played.? Glad I was there for some of those boxes a few times, lastly being up on Clingmans Dome. We almost joined you for that extra early hike that day but I do not suffer mornings well.? I believe you were spending four weeks in the Smokys at the time hiking.? Seems that you are the Lance Armstrong of the boxing world taking pot shots from the French.<br/>

Well, to many of the regular letterboxers in southern New England, this is probably old news by now, but I just wanted to let folks in some other parts of the country know that I reached PFX 25,000 on Thursday, May 28th at "Off The Beaten Path" in Shrewsbury, MA!  The previous couple of months, after trips to CA/NV/AZ and TX, had involved some fairly intensive letterboxing, hiking and traveling on my own, from snowy days in the Smokies to 4 days in a row reaching 90+ degree temps, including at least one 100+ box day during that very hot spell in VA!   Then, of course, after I got home, Pete kept me going, even when I was ready to drop, with lots of new plants within a 100-mile or so radius  of RI, so I was quickly able to reach PFX 25,000 even on a rainy afternoon after just having had oral surgery by doing a bunch of box hunts at a few local libraries! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, one thing I was really impressed with on my last trip down south was the proliferation of plants by "letterboxing couples" - folks like Rottie Love and Kevin in VA, Doug &amp; Denise N10EC, and By His Grace and her hubby in TN, who seem to take turns planting and share a more equal interest in letterbox hunting and planting than many of the couples we've met in other parts of the country, where one member is often far more interested in letterboxing than the other.  One of my favorite memories of this last trip, however, is bound to be that of reconnecting with my old backpacking friend "Jumpstart", so called because he began his first AT thru-hike in the mid 80s by parachuting onto Springer Mountain in his late 60s!  Well, after some 400 successful parachute jumps and a couple more completed AT and PCT treks, he just last year, in his late 80s, fell out of a tree and broke a whole bunch of bones.  Since so many of the boxes in his area are "drive-bys", including one where he used to work for many years, I though I'd try taking him out letterboxing to a few of them, and - guess what - he liked it!  So, now I'm pleased to say that Robie and his wife Lana are now only the second (after myself) "radical repeater/multitrail thru-hikers" ever to join the ranks of letterboxers!  (I'm still working on recruiting another fellow "triple crowner/radical repeater", but that could take awhile! :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was great to see the strong hold letterboxing has taken taken all up and down the AT corridor, and how many folks are getting back to our hobby's "hiking roots" from that first ever North American letterbox planted on Max Patch along the AT near Hot Springs, NC on April 26, 1998! ( not to forget the first ever "drive-by" planted at Prayer Rock in VT just a few days later!) It is so wonderful to see this trend - the return to the hunt, the original heart and soul of letterboxing  - taking hold even at some of the recent gatherings we have been attending, where fewer and fewer people just hang around the tables doing stamping, while more and more get out on the trails for those real "treasure hunts" - hurray!  We're also thrilled to see the Mansfield area of CT making a real comeback as America's original letterboxing hot spot with a great new series of carvings from around the country representing the 50 states, each apparently on a hike of about a mile or so, which is getting back to what letterboxing in these parts used to be like - kudos to everyone involved in that great America the Beautiful project!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, now June is supposedly my "rest month" before getting ready for some more mountain adventures later this summer.  We're happy to report, however, that the historic LbNA F500 box, after having disappeared for several years, is back in operation, and we are once again accepting photos to put into it from anyone who reaches that milestone.  Our PFX clubs ( http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html ) are also still open to anyone who wants to send us their names and dates for reaching a particular milestone, and we are pleased to congratulate such recent additions as Magical Music Man for PFX  500, The Seekers of NC and Sparky Butterfly of CT for F 1000, and Oldhounder and Siamese of MA for PFX 5000!!!  Congrats to all who are having so much fun with our delightful hobby!<br/>

&gt; Congratulations!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I'm not into this hobby/game for the counts I can certainly understand those that like that aspect of Letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Interesting how Letterboxing caters to so many different ways to play!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Oh, it's so interesting to see all the different personality types involved in this hobby, too: the sweet, the gracious, the jealous, the pugnacious! Oh, how many different revealing types of responses one can get just from sharing one's joy about one particularly hot and happy day... or whole bunches of them...it just makes me chuckle thinking about it!!! Oh, did I forget to say that my recent VA 100+ box day was also a gathering day, which I just happened to decide to attend at the very last moment because I knew I wasn't going to be able to get back far enough north in time to go looking for a "mapsurfer box" or some such thing with Lightnin' Bug and Pink Panther in PA that day, as originally planned? And, oh, did I fail, as usual, to mention that I was the first, and at some perhaps the only finder that day, of many of the boxes I found in that lovely big park around the lake, so I didn't have to take time to stop and read every entry the way I usually like to do? And, oh, did I neglect to say that many of those boxes had hitchhikers in them (like those old "evil ones"), and, that going by those old "mapsurfer guidelines" (although not by the more recent AQ separation of categories), hitchikers actually count as finds? And, oh, did I not add that I could have found even more boxes that day had I continued on to the "official night boxing" over at the farm, but I opted instead to do my own version of nightboxing just so that I could find every single box that was then in the park, plus a few outside the park as well, which really did take me quite a few hours in the dark! Oh, I could go on and on, but it's just too funny thinking that some folks could get themselves so worked up trying to figure out how many minutes it took me to find each box that they missed the whole point - that I was just grateful for being able to do what I did that day, and that I simply had a blast!!! (as I do on most every letterbox day, however big or small!) My quip about "o-races&amp;quo t; was meant merely as a joke for Randy to cons<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ider the possibility that, despite my own personal feelings of inadequacy about my current state of "decrepitude" (which I, of course, expected him to share - I know, "low self esteem"!), there might somehow be someone in orienteering I could actually still be faster than! I know next to nothing about "o-racing", nor have I any interest in it (other than if a signpost were to help me find a letterbox!:-), so it never even occurred to me that Randy could possibly take my quip as a personal challenge to Himself! O, how things can get misinterpreted! And, oh, the "male ego"! (this is just another light-hearted jab at Randy, in case he can't tell! :-), but it really does seem to me that he just has a case of "sour grapes" because, with all the other terrific boxes now available in beautiful places all around the country, we just no longer have much vested interest in going looking for particular boxes as we did when they were practically the "only act in town" (although I do have to admit we were a bit intrigued by the recent piquant travel tales of a certain investigator!;) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I really do think that some people take themselves far too seriously sometimes, myself included. Just as my backpacking days meant so much to me because I was recovering from a fractured spine and it just astounded me that I could do it at all, and therefore made a point of counting every backpacking mile, so, too, now with letterboxing I stay focused on counting my finds because it just means so much to me that I can still keep myself going that way sometimes in spite of the bouts of fibromyalgia, PTSD, and other problems. However, it should go without saying that if it were just about the numbers and that I didn't really still love so many aspects of this hobby, I would have quit long ago! And as much as I love the idea that letterboxing, like backpacking, is essentially a private noncompetitive undertaking ( that's actually why I chose them both!), and I basically boycott those activities (road rallies, geocaching contests and such) that encourage "racing" (other than simply to stretch toward reaching one's own personal goals), I suppose it would be just as naive of anyone to maintain that letterboxing has no experience levels as it would be to insist that there is no distinction between "weekend warriors", " thru-hikers", "radical repeaters" and "triple crowners" in the backpacking world. (And the thought of Randy "pulling" a woman off the AT is, of course, absolutely terrifying! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we set up our PFX clubs to acknowledge the hard work most people do to reach particular letterboxing levels, once again sort of following "mapsurfer guidelines", suggesting that we set the next rung - (after F500, for which Randy even initiated a special box!) - at F2500 - "to give others the chance to catch up"! (Yup, it's in the archives! hmm..sounds a bit more "competitive-oriented" than"acknowledgement-oriented" to us, Randy!:- ) Anyway, quite a few folks wanted an intermediary step of F1000 to gauge their progress, so we gladly complied, and we're happy to see that the system has worked quite well. Of course, some of the newer folks may prefer those AQ "Halls of Fame", which don't, as far as I know, give dates for any sort of historical context. In any case, though, some people nowadays could do 500 local "drive-bys" (yes, it's imperative to focus on that verbal aspect!;-) and still get the same "credit" as someone doing big hikes all around the country, but who cares? Whatever a person wants to get out of the hobby is up to that individual, and I don't feel like I'm boasting if I want to share my joy about getting such a lot out of this hobby in so many different ways and accomplishing something that just a few years back I wouldn't have even thought possible! I guess I can understand how that might be upsetting, though, to some folks with even lower self esteem than I have, but that's more of a reflection on them than on me, and perhaps includes those who think that only they should be allowed to brag about what boxes they've found or that only what they have to say matters, those who desire instant gratification without putting in the time and effort of working their way up the ladder, and those seemingly inherently so full of themselves and their own superiority that they refuse to acknowledge that any ladder even exists because they are already simply the "best"! These are the folks I personally have th e most trouble with, the narcissists, whereas, I happen to be at the other end of the spectr<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
um, always thinking that no matter how much I do, it's never going to be good enough to please that "witch of an inner critic", and that I'll never find enough boxes to gain acceptance from the "letterboxing demons"! So now I just have to say thanks again, not only to the planters who keep me striving to at least try to be that "good enough letterboxer", who could finally find enough boxes to appease those horrible demons (probably never happen!), but especially to those folks with such high self esteem that they could actually "ego-afford" to be happy for me and congratulate me rather than just trying to find ways to shut me up or put me down! Oh, you wonderful, wonderful people - you'll probably never know just how much that has meant to me! Now maybe I actually can take a little break and rest in peace, at least for a little while....Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!!!!<br/>
Love,<br/>

ider the possibility that, despite my own personal feelings of inadequacy about my current state of "decrepitude" (which I, of course, expected him to share - I know, "low self esteem"!), there might somehow be someone in orienteering I could actually still be faster than! I know next to nothing about "o-racing", nor have I any interest in it (other than if a signpost were to help me find a letterbox!:- ), so it never even occurred to me that Randy could possibly take my quip as a personal challenge to Himself! O, how things can get misinterpreted! And, oh, the "male ego"! (this is just another light-hearted jab at Randy, in case he can't tell! :-), but it really does seem to me that he just has a case of "sour grapes" because, with all the other terrific boxes now available in beautiful places all around the country, we just no longer have much vested interest in going looking for particular boxes as we did when they were practically the "only act in<br/>
 town" (although I do have to admit we were a bit intrigued by the recent piquant travel tales of a certain investigator! ;) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I really do think that some people take themselves far too seriously sometimes, myself included. Just as my backpacking days meant so much to me because I was recovering from a fractured spine and it just astounded me that I could do it at all, and therefore made a point of counting every backpacking mile, so, too, now with letterboxing I stay focused on counting my finds because it just means so much to me that I can still keep myself going that way sometimes in spite of the bouts of fibromyalgia, PTSD, and other problems. However, it should go without saying that if it were just about the numbers and that I didn't really still love so many aspects of this hobby, I would have quit long ago! And as much as I love the idea that letterboxing, like backpacking, is essentially a private noncompetitive undertaking ( that's actually why I chose them both!), and I basically boycott those activities (road rallies, geocaching contests and such) that<br/>
 encourage "racing" (other than simply to stretch toward reaching one's own personal goals), I suppose it would be just as naive of anyone to maintain that letterboxing has no experience levels as it would be to insist that there is no distinction between "weekend warriors", " thru-hikers" , "radical repeaters" and "triple crowners" in the backpacking world. (And the thought of Randy "pulling" a woman off the AT is, of course, absolutely terrifying! :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we set up our PFX clubs to acknowledge the hard work most people do to reach particular letterboxing levels, once again sort of following "mapsurfer guidelines", suggesting that we set the next rung - (after F500, for which Randy even initiated a special box!) - at F2500 - "to give others the chance to catch up"! (Yup, it's in the archives! hmm..sounds a bit more "competitive- oriented" than"acknowledgemen t-oriented" to us, Randy!:- ) Anyway, quite a few folks wanted an intermediary step of F1000 to gauge their progress, so we gladly complied, and we're happy to see that the system has worked quite well. Of course, some of the newer folks may prefer those AQ "Halls of Fame", which don't, as far as I know, give dates for any sort of historical context. In any case, though, some people nowadays could do 500 local "drive-bys" (yes, it's imperative to focus on that verbal aspect!;-) and still get the same "credit" as someone doing big hikes all<br/>
 around the country, but who cares? Whatever a person wants to get out of the hobby is up to that individual, and I don't feel like I'm boasting if I want to share my joy about getting such a lot out of this hobby in so many different ways and accomplishing something that just a few years back I wouldn't have even thought possible! I guess I can understand how that might be upsetting, though, to some folks with even lower self esteem than I have, but that's more of a reflection on them than on me, and perhaps includes those who think that only they should be allowed to brag about what boxes they've found or that only what they have to say matters, those who desire instant gratification without putting in the time and effort of working their way up the ladder, and those seemingly inherently so full of themselves and their own superiority that they refuse to acknowledge that any ladder even exists because they are already simply the "best"! These are the<br/>
 folks I personally have th e most trouble with, the narcissists, whereas, I happen to be at the other end of the spectr<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
um, always thinking that no matter how much I do, it's never going to be good enough to please that "witch of an inner critic", and that I'll never find enough boxes to gain acceptance from the "letterboxing demons"! So now I just have to say thanks again, not only to the planters who keep me striving to at least try to be that "good enough letterboxer" , who could finally find enough boxes to appease those horrible demons (probably never happen!), but especially to those folks with such high self esteem that they could actually "ego-afford" to be happy for me and congratulate me rather than just trying to find ways to shut me up or put me down! Oh, you wonderful, wonderful people - you'll probably never know just how much that has meant to me! Now maybe I actually can take a little break and rest in peace, at least for a little while....Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wanda, you're obviously totally involved in letterboxing and are ecstatic<br/>
about your ever-growing PFX count.  And I'm very happy that you're happy.<br/>
Being *proud* of counts.........that's a horse of a different color.<br/>
Jealous?  That seems a strange emotion in letterboxing.  I guess I just<br/>
don't see anything serious enough about letterboxing counts to be jealous of<br/>
them.  But that's just me.  I think it's fantastic that you've got ample<br/>
time to be able to do what you so obviously love doing.   Other people have<br/>
either other responsibilities or other loves that preclude being able to<br/>
spend all their chips at one table.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just dunno if people actually do "hard work" to reach a particular<br/>
letterboxing level or whether they just have more time available to do it.<br/>
A matter of responsibilities and priorities.  I'm sure that someday I'll<br/>
reach 25,000.  But I'll be long dead by that time.  I'm happy with my<br/>
somewhere-around-600.  It's what we've had time to do and what we had fun<br/>
doing when we did them.  And it's also what, with the price of gasoline,<br/>
we've been able to *afford* to do.  But, for me at least, I've never equated<br/>
pride with anything to do with my count.  I would be proud if my carving<br/>
skills were better, yes indeed I would.  I'd be proud if I could come up<br/>
with clues like the mapsurfer clues, yes indeed I would.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just don't understand what counts per se have to do with<br/>
self-esteem and feeling like a "good enough letterboxer."  But nobody has<br/>
ever put me down for not having high enough counts.  Your post kinda sounds<br/>
to me as if you *have* been put down at one time or another for low counts.<br/>
That's just how it sounds to *me*.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that worries me about your pace is emulation.  I'm sure you're<br/>
totally responsible towards the boxes you're finding.  But, in this neck of<br/>
the woods, too many boxes turn up missing, and in my opinion, it's often<br/>
because people are just moving too fast and get careless and sloppy. It just<br/>
kinda worries me that not-so-careful folks might try to emulate you and put<br/>
boxes in danger.  Which I guess is their responsibility, not yours.<br/>

<br/>
Oh, it's so interesting to see all the different personality types involved<br/>
in this hobby, too: the sweet, the gracious, the jealous, the pugnacious!<br/>
Oh, how many different revealing types of responses one can get just from<br/>
sharing one's joy about one particularly hot and happy day... or whole<br/>
bunches of them...it just makes me chuckle thinking about it!!! Oh, did I<br/>
forget to say that my recent VA 100+ box day was also a gathering day, which<br/>
I just happened to decide to attend at the very last moment because I knew I<br/>
wasn't going to be able to get back far enough north in time to go looking<br/>
for a "mapsurfer box" or some such thing with Lightnin' Bug and Pink Panther<br/>
in PA that day, as originally planned? And, oh, did I fail, as usual, to<br/>
mention that I was the first, and at some perhaps the only finder that day,<br/>
of many of the boxes I found in that lovely big park around the lake, so I<br/>
didn't have to take time to stop and read every entry the way I usually like<br/>
to do?  And, oh, did I neglect to say that many of those boxes had<br/>
hitchhikers in them (like those old "evil ones"), and, that going by those<br/>
old "mapsurfer guidelines" (although not by the more recent AQ separation of<br/>
categories), hitchikers actually count as finds? And, oh, did I not add that<br/>
I could have found even more boxes that day had I continued on to the<br/>
"official night boxing" over at the farm, but I opted instead to do my own<br/>
version of nightboxing just so that I could find every single box that was<br/>
then in the park, plus a few outside the park as well, which really did take<br/>
me quite a few hours in the dark! Oh, I could go on and on, but it's just<br/>
too funny thinking that some folks could get themselves so worked up trying<br/>
to figure out how many minutes it took me to find each box that they missed<br/>
the whole point - that I was just grateful for being able to do what I did<br/>
that day, and that I simply had a blast!!! (as I do on most every letterbox<br/>
day, however big or small!) My quip about "o-races" was meant merely as a<br/>
joke for Randy to consider the possibility that, despite my own personal<br/>
feelings of inadequacy about my current state of "decrepitude" (which I, of<br/>
course, expected him to share - I know, "low self esteem"!), there might<br/>
somehow be someone in orienteering I could actually still be faster than! I<br/>
