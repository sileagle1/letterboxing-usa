I lived on Highland Ave near Bristol street as a kid and used to go swimming up there all the time. I was one of the nuts that used to jump off the bridge. Sent all my pennies at the hot dog stand.<br/>

<br/>
Park up on Route 63 at the lot across from the green Naugatuck Town sign. <br/>
The lot is between the main entrance to the park and the Ranger House.  <br/>
Enter the park by going up the hill and through the double fence. Follow the <br/>
trail to the right thru a picnic area to the fence near the rangers house.  <br/>
Follow the chain link fence to the left and onto the road. Keep heading down <br/>
at the bottom follow the road to the left. At your first clearing on the <br/>
right, giving you a clear view of the lake look to the left for a large rock <br/>
that looks wedged between a stump and a tree..behind that boulder John <br/>
Quincy Adams waits for thee.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the road to the other side of the lake. All the way past the beach, <br/>
enter the Lakeside Trail. You will need boots for this hike. Go straight up <br/>
the trail to an open meadow. Just follow the tree line on your right side <br/>
past a sign for Spillway Trail. Just beyond that you will see a huge boulder <br/>
  on the right side of that boulder in a crevasse is Martin Van Buren.<br/>
<br/>
Go back to the meadow and keep heading straight. You will go over the cement <br/>
causeway. This is where Max and I stopped to climb both set of rocks at <br/>
either end. Keep going until you see a trail on the right side. The <br/>
outcropping of rocks part way up hides your next find. If you are standing <br/>
behind the rocks overlooking the meadow  Andrew Jackson is in a crevasse to <br/>
the left. Be careful here.<br/>
<br/>
Go back and continue up the trail. At the top follow the trail to the left. <br/>
If the main trail is flooded you can follow the little trail that runs <br/>
parallel it will bring you back to the same place. At the intersection of <br/>
these trails in front of you to the left is a rock that looks like and <br/>
elephant head and trunk. James Monroe is right where the tusk should be.<br/>
<br/>
Keep heading in the same direction until you come to the dam. Follow the <br/>
asphalt road to the right. Go up to the top and back into the woods. On this <br/>
trail when you reach the highest peak and you can see the lake in front of <br/>
you look for a group of rocks with a tree growing out of the center of them. <br/>
Around back on the left corner is JFK.<br/>
<br/>
You can either follow this trail back to the meadow or go back to the dam <br/>
and walk along the road to your car.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!!<br/>
