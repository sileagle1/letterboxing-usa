&gt; Hope you enjoy Alicia's version of the Four Seasons.  http://www.geocities.com/trishkri/4Seasons.html<br/>

Just had to say how delighted we were to find our niece's wonderful new <br/>
letterbox series, The Four Seasons, in southwestern RI.  Carving such <br/>
charming stamps, and hiding the boxes so well in record time would be <br/>
quite an accomplishment for anyone, but the fact that it was done by an <br/>
8-year old makes this series all the more impressive!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Alicia, for a special glimpse into the sweet, creative impulses <br/>
of the "next generation", and thanks to your mom for being supportive.<br/>
