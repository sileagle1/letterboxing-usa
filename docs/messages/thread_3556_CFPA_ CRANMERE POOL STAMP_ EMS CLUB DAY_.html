                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry you didn't find us on Saturday in Voluntown CSCM. Only a few of us<br/>
ended up showing up as a matter of fact. We have some great new friends in<br/>
our letterboxing circles! Patty Pendergast of the Ct Forest and Park<br/>
Association is now a letterboxer. The CFPA is the organization that<br/>
primarily maintains the 700 miles of CT Blues Blazed trails. They also<br/>
publish the CT Walk Book that is full of maps and trail descriptions of some<br/>
of or favorite letterboxing paths.<br/>
Come and meet Patty this saturday the 27 at Eastern Mountain Sports in<br/>
Waterford, CT as she'll have a table set up telling us all about the CFPA<br/>
and what it's about!<br/>
Also, COME SEE THE STAMP FOR THE FIRST EVER LETTERBOX IN THE WORLD FOR<br/>
CRANMERE POOL. The gentleman that published the Pequot woods series of<br/>
letterboxes made a visit to Dartmoor and brought back a copy of the Cranmere<br/>
Pool stamp. Come see it, and get 20% OFF of everything in the store that<br/>
day! As letterboxers, you all qualify for the discount in our store!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, EMS has over 80 stores now and Club Day will be a company wide<br/>
event. Belong to any outdoor club or organization and get 20% off everything<br/>
in whatever store you are in! Great time to pick up new letterboxing gear!<br/>

of?<br/>
<br/>
The P = Placed  F = Found and X = exchanged (with other letterboxers <br/>
met). Some people also add E = events. Every now and then someone <br/>
organizes a get-together somewhere and a stamp(s) for the event  <br/>
is made.<br/>
<br/>
Did you attend the CFPA/EMS day hike?<br/>
