<br/>
Just wanted to post that the boxes have each been replenished with 50 <br/>
cards each and the extra tidbits have been refilled as well (with the <br/>
exception of the Bonus box which got only 50 copies of a cool poem).<br/>
<br/>
If there was anyone that recently did the series and did not get the <br/>
info, please email me and I will email you back the text of the cards <br/>
and the extra information since we were unable to get out there until <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
It was nice to see so many stamps in there, some familiar and some <br/>
new!  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone reads this that WANTS to do the series, please note that <br/>
some sort of bug repellant should be mandatory for everyone in your <br/>
group!  I forgot to put that in the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if anyone continued on the trail and can remember well enough, <br/>
please let me know how to complete the rest of the trail so I can <br/>
post it with the clues!<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to all!<br/>
