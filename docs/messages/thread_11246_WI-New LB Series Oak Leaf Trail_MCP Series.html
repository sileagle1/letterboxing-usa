and enjoy the spring weather :)!  Sorry I couldn't get this out before the<br/>
weekend.  The snow storm last week slowed my progress.  The text clues are<br/>
given below.  Ruthann should have the web version with the pictures up soon.<br/>
The Environmental Classroom LB page was also updated, but no change in clues<br/>
- just cleaning it up.  Enjoy!<br/>

Oak Leaf Trail/MCP Series<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Tim Kuehl ("The Dragon")<br/>
Number of Boxes: 9<br/>
Date: March 15, 2003<br/>
City: Milwaukee<br/>
County: Milwaukee<br/>
State: Wisconsin<br/>
Terrain and Time: Given with each clue below<br/>
<br/>
This is a series of letterboxes hidden in some of the best county parks in<br/>
the nation - the Milwaukee County Parks! (Don't let the snowy pictures<br/>
scare you off. The parks are great at any time of year!) The series of<br/>
nine stamps fit together like a puzzle to make a larger 4" x 6" picture.<br/>
The clues are given in the same order you should find the letterboxes to fit<br/>
the puzzle together. You may find the letterboxes in another order, but you<br/>
must be careful to fit the stamps together more carefully. The picture<br/>
below shows how the stamps fit together and where each stamp is to be<br/>
found. You might lightly trace the puzzle outline into your stamp book to<br/>
help you place the stamps correctly. Addresses for the parks are given so<br/>
you can locate them using Map Quest. Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
#1-Brown Deer Park Letterbox<br/>
Time: 30 minutes. Terrain: Easy.<br/>
Brown Deer Park is located on the northeast side of Milwaukee at 7835 N.<br/>
Green Bay Rd. The park is most famous for the Greater Milwaukee Open - a<br/>
part of the PGA tour played on the golf course at the park. The pond in the<br/>
park is also a great place for ice skating in the winter and for pedal boats<br/>
in the summer. Fishing in the pond and cross country skiing are also great<br/>
activities to do at the park.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
As you enter the park, follow the signs pointing you to the Boathouse. Take<br/>
the one-way circle drive that leads to the Boathouse and park in one of the<br/>
parking spaces located on this drive past the Boathouse. Go to the terrace<br/>
behind the Boathouse and sit on the bench that has you look out over a large<br/>
open field (which is a great place for flying kites). Sitting in the middle<br/>
of that bench, locate the large tree at the edge of the woods across the<br/>
field at a bearing of 82 degrees. Walk across the field towards that tree,<br/>
and stop before the bush in front of the large tree. Along the edge of the<br/>
woods, walk 34 paces north to a path that leads into the woods. Take this<br/>
path into the woods and it shortly comes to a "T". Take the left path<br/>
across the bridge (which is much sturdier than the fallen tree I used to<br/>
cross the creek when I was young and promptly lost my balance and got<br/>
completely drenched : ) ). Stay on this major trail as it heads north for a<br/>
while then bends towards the east. Soon after heading east, you will come<br/>
to a fork in the trail where a large tree has fallen towards the trail on<br/>
the right. Take 12 paces down the right fork and turn right. Directly in<br/>
front of you (about 10 paces) is a large tree standing a short distance<br/>
before the trunk of the large tree that has fallen over. Go to this large<br/>
standing tree and you'll notice a large opening in its side. Reach inside<br/>
to the left to find the letterbox hidden in a small crevice inside the<br/>
trunk. This stamp goes in the upper right corner of the fuller 4" x 6"<br/>
picture so be sure to give yourself room in your stamp book. After stamping<br/>
up, return the box into the crevice in the tree.<br/>
<br/>
Note: On your way to Estabrook Park, you might look into finding BirkieBob's<br/>
letterboxes - Mt. Beitermann and Childhood Memories - as they are on the way<br/>
from Brown Deer Park to Estabrook Park.<br/>
<br/>
#2 &amp; #3-Estabrook Park Letterboxes<br/>
Time: 75 minutes. Terrain: Easy with some steep hills.<br/>
Estabrook Park is located on the east side of Milwaukee at 4400 N. Estabrook<br/>
Dr. The Milwaukee River flows along the west side of the park over dams and<br/>
rapids. A nature trail follows NW along the more scenic parts of the river<br/>
starting at the bottom of the steps behind the building near the parking lot<br/>
were you begin your search for the two letterboxes located in this park.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Enter the park from its north (Hampton Ave.) entrance and park in the<br/>
parking lot for Picnic Area #5. Park on the south end of the lot. Head<br/>
south along the park road to the railroad crossing. Follow the railroad<br/>
tracks west towards the river (no need to worry about trains coming!). Soon<br/>
you will see why you do not need to worry about trains heading this way. Go<br/>
down to where a train would end up if one DID go this way without stopping.<br/>
Take the trail leading to the southeast along the river. Stay on this trail<br/>
along the river for quite awhile. You will shortly get to a clearing with<br/>
some steps leading up. Don't take the stairs. Rather, continue on the<br/>
trail along the river next to a stone wall. Soon you will go up some stairs<br/>
to another set of stairs that lead all the way up. Again, stay on the trail<br/>
along the river by taking the stairs in front of you that lead back down.<br/>
(You might notice some ladders made out of some tree branches along the<br/>
way. I believe these were placed by mountain bikers to circumvent some of<br/>
the trail hazards they would face.) Eventually you will pass over a 2 foot<br/>
diameter pipe sticking out of the ground towards the river. About 15 feet<br/>
of it will be sticking out of the ground on your right. Standing on the<br/>
path directly above where the pipe would pass underneath you, take a bearing<br/>
of 110 degrees. Site a tree up the embankment on that heading with a large<br/>
number of gnarled roots exposed. Go to this tree. (You might want to<br/>
approach it from the top or bottom if from the side is too tricky.) On the<br/>
side of the tree facing the river, sit on the root that forms a nice seat.<br/>
You will find yourself facing the river with a parking lot and radio/TV<br/>
towers across the river. The box is right behind you under the trunk, kept<br/>
in place by a stone. You'll have to move the stone and reach deep to the<br/>
right. This stamp fits under the Brown Deer stamp. After stamping up,<br/>
replace the box and the stone under the tree.<br/>
<br/>
Go back to the trail above the pipe and continue south on the trail. After<br/>
hiking awhile, you will pass a fenced-in area where some of the cables<br/>
holding up the radio/TV tower are anchored into the ground. Shortly after,<br/>
the trail splits. Take the left path that quickly goes out to an open area<br/>
(careful - this may be an archery range). To the east, atop the hill, is a<br/>
stone building. Go to the other side of this building and find the green<br/>
electrical box on the ground. From the electrical box, head east to the<br/>
bike path sign (about 50 yards). Follow the Oak Leaf Trail up to a "T" in<br/>
the asphalt path and turn north (left). Start counting the white "buried<br/>
fiber optic cable" posts. Take the path north even when it turns from<br/>
asphalt to a dirt trail through the woods. (Note: the white posts change to<br/>
the right side when the path changes to dirt.) Stop at the 14th white<br/>
post. (Note: the 12th post is just before the old double train bridge.)<br/>
Behind (east of) the 14th pole and to the right down a small embankment,<br/>
find a five trunked tree. To the south of that tree (about 4 feet away) is<br/>
a tree with a small ditch at its back base. (If you walk between these two<br/>
trees, you'll end up in the small ditch.) In the ditch, you should find a<br/>
metal railroad plate under some loose tree bark. Under the plate is an old<br/>
sewer pipe opening that the letterbox is tucked into. The stamp goes<br/>
directly below the last stamp. After stamping up, be sure to replace the<br/>
metal plate and tree bark to hide the box.<br/>
<br/>
Return to the white pole and head directly west from the pole to the second<br/>
set of railroad tracks. Follow these tracks south then as they curve west.<br/>
They will lead back to the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Note: On your way to Grant Park, you might want to stop to search for the<br/>
Green One/Calatrava letterboxes which are on the way.<br/>
<br/>
#4-Grant Park Letterbox<br/>
Time: 30 minutes. Terrain: Easy.<br/>
Grant Park is located on the southeast side of Milwaukee County at 100 E.<br/>
Hawthorne Ave. in the city of South Milwaukee. The "Seven Bridges" trail is<br/>
located in this park, and worth viewing if you have the time. The trial is<br/>
located just to the north of where you park for the letterbox. The park<br/>
also has a very nice golf course and both bluffs overlooking the lake and a<br/>
nice beach. I have always enjoyed the curvy route the bike path takes<br/>
though the parks on the southeast side - much like a roller coaster at<br/>
times!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Park in Parking Area 3. On the northeast end of the lot, the Oak Leaf Trail<br/>
crosses the road. Walk on this asphalt bike path east towards the lake.<br/>
After a little while, the path will curve to the right up a small hill.<br/>
Near the top of the hill is a wide opening to the left that one could take a<br/>
few yards to a cliff edge overlooking the lake. Stay on the asphalt trail<br/>
and as you begin to go slightly downhill you should find a triangle of large<br/>
rocks - two on your left and one on your right. Behind the single rock on<br/>
the right is a tree that has fallen towards the rock. Nearby you should<br/>
find a small "deer" path you can use to get to the base end of the fallen<br/>
tree. With your butt up against the end of the fallen tree (which is<br/>
resting next to its 15 foot tall stump) lean slightly to the left to look<br/>
around the small tree in front of you. You should spot a double-trunked<br/>
tree about 80 feet in front of you (one trunk is barkless, the other is<br/>
healthy). Take the deer path to that tree. You should find the tree is<br/>
next to the path between two medium sized trees that lay across the path.<br/>
Step over the second fallen tree and count off 13 more steps along the<br/>
path. To your left is a tree that has fallen with some of its trunk just<br/>
bent over (not a clean break). Reach into the center of the trunk that is<br/>
still standing and find the letterbox buried under some bark. This stamp<br/>
goes under the second Estabrook Park stamp to complete the right side of the<br/>
larger picture. After stamping up, be sure to replace the box with the bark<br/>
on top of it.<br/>
<br/>
#5-Mitchell Park Letterbox<br/>
Time: 30 minutes. Terrain: Easy.<br/>
Mitchell Park is located in the middle of Milwaukee at 524 S. Layton Blvd.<br/>
The park is home of the Domes - a unique indoor botanical gardens featuring<br/>
a desert dome and a tropical rainforest dome. The third dome changes by<br/>
season. The Domes are worth a visit if you have the time. The rest of the<br/>
park is divided between nicely landscaped orchards and trees, places for the<br/>
homeless to camp, and a place for the garbage to blow to from the nearby<br/>
dumps - a strange mixture of the best and worst of nature.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Park in the Domes' parking lot and walk around the south side of the Domes.<br/>
Head east downhill to the pavilion on the north end of the pond. Behind the<br/>
pavilion to the NNE you will see a baseball backstop. Go to the ball field<br/>
and walk along the first-base side towards right field to the yellow foul<br/>
pole then beyond to the tree line. (You might pass a rather large<br/>
"anthill".) Walk along the edge of the trees going north, then turning west<br/>
at the corner, keeping the trees on your right. After walking west for<br/>
about 100 yards, the tree line bends southwest and up a steep hill. In the<br/>
bend is a small trail continuing west into the trees. (A number of homeless<br/>
live here at night.) Follow the path through the trees until you come to a<br/>
road. Head downhill on the road along the north fence. Where the lower<br/>
iron fence changes to a wooden fence, the letterbox is hidden in front of<br/>
the wooden pole under some leaves and a rock. This stamp goes to the left<br/>
of the Grant Park stamp, completing the bottom of the larger picture. After<br/>
stamping up, replace the box with the debris on top of it. Also, enjoy the<br/>
view of the valley : )!<br/>
<br/>
#6-Doyne Park Letterbox<br/>
Time: 45 minutes. Terrain: Easy with some hills.<br/>
Doyne Park is also in the center of Milwaukee north of Miller Park and west<br/>
of the Miller Brewery at 5316 W. Wells St. (Stop for a Brewers game or<br/>
brewery tour if you have time!) Doyne Park was our hangout back in high<br/>
school. About its only feature is a nine hole par-3 golf course, but we<br/>
enjoyed it for the old swings, the hill in the middle of the park, and the<br/>
sights and sounds coming down the river valley at night.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
To get to the parking lot, you must take the driveway into the park located<br/>
at about 53rd and Wells. The park itself is hidden by the houses that<br/>
surround it. Park in the lot near the basketball court. Cross the<br/>
basketball court and go to the swings. Take time to enjoy the swings and<br/>
reminisce about earlier times when swings were bigger and taller, more fun,<br/>
and less safe. Continue on the asphalt path heading east as it goes along<br/>
the backyards of the houses. As you go parallel to the soccer field, look<br/>
across the field to the hill in the middle of the golf course. Imagine<br/>
lying on the top of the hill on a warm summer night staring up at the stars<br/>
with Culture Club, Duran Duran, and other great 80s music playing on a small<br/>
boom box, or listening to the sounds of baseball or Summerfest coming down<br/>
the valley. Stay on the asphalt trail as it goes between the church/school<br/>
and east soccer goal. (You might stop and pay tribute to the old swing set<br/>
that used to stand where the soccer goal is now by dancing to "I'll Tumble 4<br/>
U" by Culture Club.) Continue on the path as it heads towards the east end<br/>
of the park. Before you reach the end of the path at Wells Street, there is<br/>
a grove of trees that sticks out from a chain-link fence on the left of the<br/>
path. A solitary tree stands in a small clearing before you get to the<br/>
grove. Head towards the solitary tree and then to the fence behind it. You<br/>
should find a path that heads downhill to the north along the fence. Follow<br/>
on the trail until the fence ends, then head left (west) away from the<br/>
bridge and towards the trail that goes west along the river. Continue west<br/>
along the river trail over a concrete wash basin. Eventually you'll begin<br/>
to see a stone fence and numerous concrete slabs on your left up the<br/>
embankment as the path gets closer to the river. Walking on the path along<br/>
the river, you'll soon see two brown poles sticking up out of the ground<br/>
perpendicular to the river, with a gray pole sticking up on the left of the<br/>
trail. Count off 48 paces from the brown poles heading west on the trail<br/>
past a bridge across the river (don't cross the bridge). On the 48th step,<br/>
stop and face left. Just above the rock wall is a tree whose trunk makes a<br/>
wide V stretching out towards you. The letterbox is hidden in the hole in<br/>
the rocks at the base of the tree. You'll have to remove the red brick rock<br/>
piece that holds the letterbox in place. This stamp goes right above the<br/>
Mitchell Park stamp. After stamping up, replace the letterbox under the<br/>
tree with the rock holding it in place and continue west on the trail. When<br/>
you come upon another chain-link fence with a gate, turn left and go up the<br/>
slight hill. Continue straight and find your car.<br/>
<br/>
Note: You might want to find the Wehr Nature Center and Boerner Botanical<br/>
Gardens letterboxes before going to the Hanson Golf Course/Underwood Creek<br/>
Parkway box.<br/>
<br/>
#7-Hansen Golf Course/Underwood Creek Parkway Letterbox<br/>
Time: 60 minutes. Terrain: Easy with some hills.<br/>
Underwood Creek Parkway is located on the west-central side of Milwaukee at<br/>
9800 W. Underwood Creek Parkway. This rather large park has a nice 18-hole<br/>
par-3 golf course, nice tennis courts, lots of forest trails, great places<br/>
to run, and great places for watching trains. You might (carefully) place a<br/>
few pennies on the railroad tracks near the 10th hole. By the time you<br/>
return, they most likely will be "smooshed"!<br/>
<br/>
