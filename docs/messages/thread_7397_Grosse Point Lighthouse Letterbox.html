Cook County.<br/>
<br/>
This historic lighthouse is 113 foot tall and was built in 1873. It was built <br/>
after several shipwrecks demonstrated its need. Look for more information on <br/>
the web for its history and for the museum hours.  The lighthouse <br/>
participates in the US Lighthouse Society "Passport Program."<br/>
<br/>
The Clues:<br/>
Starting from the parking lot, look for sculptures in the grass. After <br/>
pondering the sculptures, continue across the lawn to the sidewalk along the <br/>
road.  <br/>
Pass the "house" named after a color.<br/>
See the light, and follow it through the gates, forward on a long straight <br/>
path to some stones. The stones will take you on a journey and lead you down <br/>
to a dock that goes nowhere.</div>
