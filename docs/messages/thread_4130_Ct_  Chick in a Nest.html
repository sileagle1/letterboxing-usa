with a warm new book. She is most happy to spend the first snowy day <br/>
in such comfort. Thanks to all who stamped book one and to those who <br/>
will beseeking the chick soon. Please stop by Black Fish on your way <br/>
I didn't check the box as I was there not long ago and thought I'd <br/>
not leave any unneccesary footprints. <br/>
   I also went to Sunset Trails which was planted for a gathering in <br/>
mansfield Hollow on 7/31/01 . I have altered the stamp from the event <br/>
status and will post the clues to this box soon as I can lay my hands <br/>
on them. I thought I knew exactly where they were and of course they <br/>
are not! <br/>
   Great day on the trail snow in the Hemlocks was beautiful. Gemma <br/>
our dog and I  enjoyed every bit of our walk.  <br/>
