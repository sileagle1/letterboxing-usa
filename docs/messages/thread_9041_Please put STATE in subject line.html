<div>We are new to this newsgroup and, while we are

<div>Outlook has limited rule making capability but it

only read those posts that have VA, DC or MD in the subject.  <br/>
Otherwise I've learned to recognize some of the common posters from <br/>
the area and read those.  I know I must be missing a lot.<br/>

Unless of course it's a really general subject like how to make <br/>
