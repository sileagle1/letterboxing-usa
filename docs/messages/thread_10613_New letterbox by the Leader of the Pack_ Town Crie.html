<h2>Town Crier</h2>
<p>Chaplin Ct. Windham County<br/>In Honor of the Birthday of 
Butterfly<br/>Planted 1-20-03 by Leader of the Pack<br/><span class="004013123-03022003"> <br/><a href="http://www.psychokiwi.org/letterboxing/leaderofthepack/towncrier.htm">www.psychokiwi.org/letterboxing/leaderofthepack/towncrier.htm</a></span></p>
<p><span class="004013123-03022003">Rated : 30 minutes river edge ,rocky overhangs 
hold children’s hand, leash dogs. Water is very swift and would carry them 
away.<br/> <br/> “2 p.m. and all is well , Happy Birthday Butterfly. “ 
Echoed through the village as the town crier wound his way through the streets 
as everyday he would, calling out the time and a brief bit of news. In old days 
most people did not have a clock and there were few forms of communication the 
Town Crier was an important carrier of information. This Town Crier has such an 
important message to shout out now! <br/> Come to Chaplin via Rte 6 stop by 
“ <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~irishtinker/melted.htm">Melted</a>” (<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~irishtinker/melted.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~irishtinker/melted.htm</a>) then 
go back down Rte 6 to the junction of Rte 198. Go north on Rte 198 , pass the 
firehouse and take your second right. ( If you go over the bridge you went to 
far) Turn into the Diana’s Pool parking lot for fishing. From the center of the 
parking lot take the trail at 40 degrees and proceed upstream. Through groves of 
Hemlocks and ,stone and along a winding riverside path. Scramble up a 4 foot 
stone face. ( If icy sit and slide on the return) Along through matching round 
boulders until you come to a stone wall running from 140 degrees to 340 degrees. 
Turn toward 140 degrees and climb up along the wall to a stone that perches on 
the top of the wall. Your box is in a crevice between two stones. NO NEED TO 
MOVE ANY STONES IN THE WALL! The box is in a bed of sticks. Please stamp in and 
re-hide well . <br/>  </span></p></span>
