<br/>
He has an on line journal at:<br/>

http://www.trailjournals.com/entry.cfm?id=32992<br/>
<br/>
It has, however, stopped with the entry for May 8 when it sounds <br/>
obvious that the weather ahead is awful.<br/>
<br/>
He made an acknowledgment page dated for the end of the year.  I hope <br/>
that did not ruin his journal program.  I hope his Great Adventure is <br/>
still going OK.<br/>
<br/>
He did post that he is planning to hit certain boxes along the way.<br/>
<br/>
I hope he posts again soon.  <br/>

I spoke with is father yesterday.  He's hit some rough weather, but is<br/>
still ahead of schedule.  Expect his journal to be updated shortly.<br/>
