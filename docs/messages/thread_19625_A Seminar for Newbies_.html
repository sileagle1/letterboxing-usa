Is there any way that you can add a mini-breakout session at the <br/>
seminar that covers why one should not 'partially' wrap the outside <br/>
of a letterbox in a ziplock bag that was originally intended to <br/>
double bag the logbook 'within' the box?  After 2 years in this <br/>
hobby, I just don't get this practice--converting a once nearly <br/>
invisible/camouflage container into a fluorescent, light refracting, <br/>
beacon of 'trail litter' from afar--just begging for the next trail <br/>
litter removal team (or more likely in these parts--the ever present <br/>
ivy removal teams) to snatch it away into litterdump (i.e. <br/>
letterbox) heaven???  <br/>
<br/>
Found three of our letterboxes that this had happened to only <br/>
yesterday!  Another time, somebody had put a 2"x2"x1" (yes, I mean <br/>
inches here) letterbox of ours in a giant 2'x1' (yes, I mean feet <br/>
here) 'cereal' bag and put it back in the nurse stump!!!  That blew <br/>
any attempt at camouflaging the letterbox out of the galaxy!!!  We <br/>
could see the plastic bag sticking out of the stump from about 25 <br/>
meters away!<br/>
<br/>
Please, please, please encourage finders to leave the letterboxes as <br/>
they found them (perhaps focusing on sealing an inner ziplock bag <br/>
when they're through instead of 'recreating' the letterbox as they <br/>
visit it).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks-<br/>
