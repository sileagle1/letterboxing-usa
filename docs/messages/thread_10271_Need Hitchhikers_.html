                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I can see that some areas of the country need more hitchhikers. <br/>
Or maybe I just get lucky and happen upon boxes with hitchhikers more <br/>
often than other folks. :-) I do enjoy what they do for my "F" count. <br/>
<br/>
And as a reminder, I do NOT suggest that there should be some rule <br/>
about hitchhikers. <br/>
<br/>
And you folks who find the hitchhikers (myself included) need to make <br/>
an effort to contact the "parents" of these wayward boxes. Part of <br/>
the fun of the hitchhiker is seeing where it's been and some people <br/>
have not heard from their hitchhikers since they set them free. <br/>
<br/>
Go on over to the letterbox_travellers board and let folks know who <br/>
and where and when! <br/>
<br/>
Just get out there and letterbox.<br/>

Shame on you!  You're experienced enough to know better!  Dropping <br/>
them at the next box.  *shaking head*  Next thing you know, you'll be <br/>
hiding some yourself!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, wait, you've done that too.  Sheeze!  =)<br/>

PS. But I do agree with The Paisley Orca--Hitch is probably my <br/>
favorite HH too!  And boy did THAT stamp get around!  I think she <br/>
single-handedly stamped it into half the boxes in the Portland area--<br/>
even if she didn't leave it in any of them but that last one!  =)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Another suggestion.  When you find one, contact the parents, yes, but <br/>
if you can, take photos of the log book too with a digital camera so <br/>
you can email the images of the stamps to the parents as well...if <br/>
they want that.  <br/>
