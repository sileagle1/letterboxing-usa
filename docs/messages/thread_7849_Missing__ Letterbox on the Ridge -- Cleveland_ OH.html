                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday I spent considerable time looking for David and <br/>
Ben's "Letterbox on the Ridge" in the Rocky River Reservation near <br/>
Cleveland. The trek was treacherous to say the least, walking along <br/>
an eroded ridge the width of a balance beam high above the woods on <br/>
either side. As it had rained the night before (hard), the clay trail <br/>
was pure slime, but I was determined to find this box!<br/>
<br/>
After scaling the 3-4 foot vertical wall of roots to get up to where <br/>
the path picked back up and locating the "hand-like" roots on the <br/>
right, I searched the exposed tree roots as indicated, but no box.  I <br/>
must have turned around and gone back along the trail 5-6 times, from <br/>
beginning (even before the hand-like roots, just in case I <br/>
misinterpretted) to the end where the trail goes down into the gully <br/>
and then up into a residential neighborhood -- checking every exposed <br/>
tree root on both sides of the ridge.  Still no box.  I did come <br/>
across a few places where an 8x14 box would have fit comfortably, but <br/>
they were empty.  At one spot, I found an empty geo-cache, but of <br/>
different description than this box.<br/>
<br/>
Wondering if anyone has found this one lately or knows the status.  <br/>
It's possible I overlooked it, as my primary focus was to keep from <br/>
falling off the ridge in a few places. I noticed in the log book of <br/>
Polly's "Just Above Par" box, located just down the trail, a few <br/>
other people had mentioned their unsuccessful attempts at the Ridge <br/>
box.<br/>
