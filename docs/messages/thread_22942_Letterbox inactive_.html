I am knew to letterboxing. My family and I went on our first hunt and are <br/>
pretty sure we found the site. We did not find the letterbox however. My <br/>
children were very disappointed. I tried to contact the placer but have not <br/>
heard back (3 weeks ago). Since this letterbox was placed a year ago could <br/>
it be inactive or missing? How do you know the last time someone found it? <br/>
I spoke to a park ranger and they said the let the letterboxes stay there a <br/>
little while and then they clean up the trails. Does someone monitor these <br/>
placements from time to time to see if they are still there and active? Are <br/>
old or inactive placements taken off the letterboxing.org site? Thanks for <br/>
your help. This is what we tried to find. Great clues and lots of fun <br/>
though!<br/>

Sometimes boxes just decided to go their own way.  Sometimes even being <br/>
sure you are right there, you might miss the spot.  I did one this <br/>
summer and upon realize it was in a flood plain and looking around for <br/>
it, I did email the placer that I thought it was gone and her comment <br/>
back was "sometimes logs will keep something hidden" - sure enough the <br/>
next time I was there, the prize was under a log I had been standing on <br/>
to look "above the floodline".  Don't give up.  <br/>
<br/>
The first box I went after, I walked 1.5 miles too far.  Why? just <br/>
missed a simple turn and then the rest "looked right".  Also, I usually <br/>
only find 8 in 10 boxes I go looking for. Some are gone and some I just <br/>
have to return and look more carefully.<br/>
<br/>
I have so much fun with letterboxing and hope you do, too.  I even <br/>
recruit kids to go with me.<br/>

Hi Carol<br/>
Welcome to Letterboxing. I have sliced up your post and hopefully <br/>
can give you some answers. First, since you are looking for a <br/>
letterbox in Santa Clarita, I'm assuming that you live somewhat <br/>
nearby. There are two chatlists for California, which I've listed at <br/>
the end, along with a newletterboxer chat list. Sometimes local <br/>
knowledge can help out in your searches. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; I am knew to letterboxing. My family and I went on our first hunt <br/>
and are <br/>
&gt; pretty sure we found the site. We did not find the letterbox <br/>
however.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox "Oak of a Golden Dream" was planted over one year ago <br/>
by a fairly new planter. Gwen &amp; I found it last July after others <br/>
listed a few attempts with not much success. When we found it we <br/>
realized that we had taken the opposite trail and just figured out <br/>
the clues backward.The clues seemed a little off and not really well <br/>
defined. The real problems you had with the clues are; #1 it was <br/>
planted by a new letterboxer and #2 It was attempted to be found by <br/>
a new letterboxer(you). I'm not being critical it is just that many <br/>
times new letterboxers have difficulty in planting as well as <br/>
finding.<br/>
<br/>
 My <br/>
&gt; children were very disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
That is part of letterboxing. As in life you will not be 100% <br/>
successful in letterboxing and this can be truly great learning <br/>
experiences for children. Your next find will be ever so much <br/>
sweeter.<br/>
<br/>
 I tried to contact the placer but have not <br/>
&gt; heard back (3 weeks ago). Since this letterbox was placed a year <br/>
ago could <br/>
&gt; it be inactive or missing? How do you know the last time someone <br/>
found it? <br/>
<br/>
There is a little green flag on the right hand side of the listing <br/>
for clues in LA. Click on that and you should have the listed <br/>
history. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I spoke to a park ranger and they said the let the letterboxes <br/>
stay there a <br/>
&gt; little while and then they clean up the trails. <br/>
<br/>
Please, please do not talk to park rangers about letterboxes. While <br/>
there probably was a request made to the contolling agency by the <br/>
letterboxer, this ranger may not have been aware of the box,or the <br/>
permission and may decide to take it upon themselves to remove the <br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Does someone monitor these <br/>
&gt; placements from time to time to see if they are still there and <br/>
active? <br/>
<br/>
The Placer should, but sometimes placers drop out of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Are <br/>
&gt; old or inactive placements taken off the letterboxing.org site? <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately there is no real mechanism to do so, and just because <br/>
a letterbox has not been found recently or ever for that matter, <br/>
that doesn't necessarily mean that it is missing.<br/>
Here is my suggestion for your future searches. Look over the <br/>
listing of clues in your area and try to pick a letterbox that has <br/>
been planted by someone that has a few plants under their belt. In <br/>
the LA area you will find some great boxes by Buzzard,Q, <br/>
Geishagirl,and several others that have quite a few plants. We keep <br/>
all of ours(Don &amp; Gwen)pretty much up to date, but most of them <br/>
require a trip to Kernville or Seal Beach.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the listings for the various chatlists I previously <br/>
mentioned. Good luck in your new found hobby.<br/>

*****Isn't it funny how often things really, really<br/>
seem like they fit the clues, and yet they are dead<br/>
wrong?  When I can't find a box, I try to backtrack<br/>
and wipe out what I "think" the clues are telling me<br/>
and relook around me to see if I could be overlooking<br/>
the real clues - or jumping the gun and<br/>
misinterpreting the clues.  <br/>
<br/>
Still though, sometimes a box is just missing - but I<br/>
have found that I was wrong more often than the box<br/>
was really missing.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This was my first letterbox back in May of this year. I read an <br/>
article about letterboxing, and the activity seemed like it would be <br/>
a lot of fun. So I used this box as a test run while I had some free <br/>
time during a business trip to the area. Little did I know how much <br/>
fun. I am nearing 300 finds and only the snow has been able to slow <br/>
me down (I am from Massachusetts).<br/>
<br/>
The "Oak of the Golden Dream" took me two attempts. Placerita Canyon <br/>
was subject to the wild fires a couple years ago and worst yet, the <br/>
rains you had in Dec 04 and Jan 05 that caused all of the mudslides, <br/>
caused significant damage to this area. Some of the trails were <br/>
washed out. In addition to what Don said about new placers and new <br/>
boxers, the damage made it a little difficult following the clues as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Try one of the others in the Santa Clatita area. "Central Park" is a <br/>
nice area but one of the two boxes may be missing. "Outdoor Ed" has <br/>
been verified recently and "It's All About the Kids" is new so you <br/>
may end up being the first finders.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I will be back in the area in mid January and if I get <br/>
a chance I will go to Placerita Canyon to check on the Oak of the <br/>
Golden Dream. Once you know where it is a return trip is very easy.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>

re your question! I wanted to add my Welcome to Letterboxing and <br/>
share my first experiences. I think it took me about four outings <br/>
before I finally found my first letterbox. That first find was a <br/>
real thrill made even more so by my early difficulty. There are lots <br/>
of them missing... this is true... but also after you start finding <br/>
a few you develop a knack for the conventions... and it gets easier <br/>
to find them... of course some people are better at placing them and <br/>
writing clues then others.... don't get discouraged... follow the <br/>
advice of the letterboxers in your area... go after the boxes that <br/>
have recently been confirmed as "active"... there are more active <br/>
letterboxes then you can ever find... because as soon as you "clear" <br/>
an area... someone will come along and plant another great series!<br/>
