                    <div class="plaintext-content">I made the decision to remove some of my boxes (retired/missing) <br/>
from LbNA, and list them at Atlas Quest.  Before I removed them, I <br/>
contacted letterboxers that had not marked them as found at AQ (most <br/>
finders had already marked them at AQ) and told them I was taking <br/>
them off LbNA.  And I plugged AQ for keeping their logbook.  I did <br/>
this because our area isn't saturated with letterboxers and <br/>
letterboxes and I didn't want to discourage new hobbyists from the <br/>
start.  Perhaps someone else will select the box-less location to <br/>
place another box.  I don't want lay sole claim to a spot.  As they <br/>
progress in their obsession, they will naturally seek out <br/>
alternative clue sites, so my original clues/history aren't really <br/>
lost to antiquity (of 2 years).<br/>
<br/>
I added jpegs of retired stamps and a photo of one missing letterbox <br/>
location.  If someone is in the area and wants to see why I placed <br/>
the box there, they can enjoy the location, box or no-box.  I will <br/>
continue this practice when boxes go missing when I have no <br/>
intention of replacing a letterbox.  This seems to work for me.<br/>
