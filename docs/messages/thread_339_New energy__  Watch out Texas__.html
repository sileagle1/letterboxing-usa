<br/>
I've recently gotten some photos back of the walk Sheila, Sylvia, Junanne<br/>
and I did to find my 4 letterboxes in November 1998 when there were still 4<br/>
of 'em out there.  (I went, too, but didn't help them find boxes.)  It<br/>
reminded me of what a great time we had and I'm remotivated to get the last<br/>
of that series in place and probably replace the boxes that went missing.<br/>
I was reading about Adrian's desire for a Colorado box and thought it could<br/>
be mighty good fun for any of us to plant boxes for each other in states or<br/>
countries other than our own.  Once I manage to get my boxes out (give me a<br/>
week or two) I'd be happy to plant boxes for others.  You'd furnish the<br/>
entire box with contents, I'd do the footwork to find a safe place and<br/>
write the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought--<br/>
Julie<br/>

Want to buy a book?  I'm trying to make a life-long dream come true and<br/>
open a bookshop.  It's tiny, but it grows now and then.  Come see!<br/>
