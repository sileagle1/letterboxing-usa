                    <html><body>Hi,
<br/>I totally screwed up the clues for my letterbox called "Operation Free Bird" I thought the name of a place was different from what it really is. Therefore below are the new rewritten clues. Sorry to all you Marylanders out there looking in vain.
<br/>
<br/>Operation Free Bird Letterbox
<br/>Western Maryland
<br/>4 August 2002
<br/>towgraysquirrels@aol.com
<br/>
<br/>During WWI there were lots of clandestine activities in the U.S. Robert Byrd had valuable information about government security and an attempt to capture him and transport him to foreign soils was in place. The CIA leaked clues about the transport of Byrd, who was being held hostage in West Virginia at the time. The story goes that the kidnappers communicated thru drop off points and one was discovered by a letterboxer in Rock Creek Park containing the following message, " Byrd must be moved by boat from Virginia into Maryland because Noland is an island. Stone pillar closest to river. South. 7 up between 3 left and 3 right for further instructions." As you all know Byrd was never relased from WV and the next drop off point with instructions was never found. Maybe you can find it.</body></html>
