<div><br/></div>Hi,<br/>After reading the Washington Post article our family 
went on our first Letterboxing adventure.  We found two out of four 
boxes.  One box, the Lake Frank Turtle in Aspen Hill, Maryland was missing 
its turtle stamp.  The two boxes in Lake Needwood, Rockville, Maryland, 
were missing.  Box No.1 at Lake Needwood had a disclaimer from 6/26/01 that 
said the box was missing and would be replaced but dispite finding the "three 
trees with one trunk," which was exactly where it was supposed to be and finding 
a bunch of rocks nearby, there was no box.  We had a similar experience at 
box 2.  Other than a little disappointment we had a great time and I am 
very impressed with your website.  Wow.  All the information anyone 
starting on this activity would ever want.  You're thourough and easy to 
follow.  Well done!<br/>Sincerely,<br/>The Scanlon Family<br/><br/><br/><tt>Your
