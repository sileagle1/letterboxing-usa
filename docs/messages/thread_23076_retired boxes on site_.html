just put retired  in the beginning of the clues so no one needed to read them <br/>
or print or keep them.  It seemed to work for me.<br/>
The box was for National Trails Day which is in June every year.  There <br/>
always is a different theme.  My stamp was that of the graphic on the National <br/>
Trails Day poster of that year<br/>
( I think 2003).  I did remove the box from its hiding place. I still have <br/>
the stamp because it's one of the few I have carved .  I use mostly bought <br/>
stamps.  I know that's not kosha but I want to plant boxes, and I stink at carving.<br/>
