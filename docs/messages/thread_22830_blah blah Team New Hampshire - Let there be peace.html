I recently followed Team New Hampshire through a series a boxes (they were long gone).  I found them to be capable and conscientious.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They located the boxes without problems, and reported the results back to the placer (she had a note posted about their findings).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Neat logbook entries.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everything was re-bagged, rewrapped and replaced carefully.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The boxes were carefully rehidden.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wish all boxers did as nice a job as they did. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's forget all these misunderstandings and work on having a great time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Team New Hampshire is a respectable group of boxers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They are welcome to do my boxes anytime,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well there will be peace, at least on this issue. Team New Hampshire has been banned. I met Dave a few weeks ago, along with his fiance, and they are very nice people. they box with their 3 kids. His posts were out of line, and he admits that. He responded poorly to what he felt was a condescending answer to a simple question and then things just got worse and worse.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that bothered me about the whole thing is I have seen many folks post as bad or worse, and they're still here. OR pop up under another name. <br/>
