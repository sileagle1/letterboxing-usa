                    <div class="plaintext-content">Early Sunday morning, we arose with plans to meet Solor and Binx<br/>
prepared to do battle with "Pirates in Hingham Harbor". As we strapped<br/>
on our swords and set our sails to begin our journey on the rugged <br/>
seas we discussed the dangers which the pirates posed lurking about<br/>
on the islands. We shoved off and soon our tiny vessels were being<br/>
tossed about on the roaring white caps. (OK so I'm exaggerating a <br/>
little - go with it). After much trepidation and some furious paddling<br/>
we arrived at the first of the designated islands. Brian, Ryan and <br/>
Solor set off in search of the box while us women folk tried to catch <br/>
our breath. We heard thrashing around in the bushes while our brave<br/>
men fearlessly fought and apparently won the first battle. The waved<br/>
a rubbermaid box at us and we stamped in wondering why only Rustypuff<br/>
and CSCM were the only other souls to have stamped in. (Maybe others <br/>
were lost at sea?). We continued on our "quest". Our boats tipping<br/>
perilously close to the waves and pulled up onto Ragged Island. Again,<br/>
Binx and I set up the towel and waited while the guys, swords in hand<br/>
fought the pesky pirates (ARRRRRRRRGH Matey). Again, only Rustypuff <br/>
and CSCM had been here. Thank Goodness for their pioneering or who <br/>
knows how many pirates we'd have had to fight. To get to the 3rd <br/>
island, we had to sail through a fleet of enemy boats. Luckily, every <br/>
one board these many ships appeared to be asleep. As we approached our<br/>
3rd and final island, we spotted a ship of questionable origin docked<br/>
where we wanted to put in. Cautiously we pulled our boats up on <br/>
shore, when suddenly, out from the trees jumped three unkempt young<br/>
men, swords in hand (actually, it was a cell phone). They had been<br/>
camping over night and were quite friendly (if not a little hung over)<br/>
and pointed the way to a large rock where the view of Boston was <br/>
breathtaking. We were able to take one the pirates ships (in our log <br/>
books) and headed back to the beach at Hingham Harbor.<br/>
A little later on we walked through the "Worlds End" and spent<br/>
some time enjoying the feel of Old New England. The views of Hull and <br/>
Boston are incomparable. Next we were going to try to go to Plymouth<br/>
but our car broke down. Solor and Binx waited with us till we were <br/>
able to get a tow truck and they gave us some cookies and water <br/>
(Thanks guys). <br/>
So we went out last night to Plymouth. A wonderful walk along the<br/>
river, under and over the bridges. There had been a family stamped <br/>
into the first box that were there that same day.  Strolling beside a <br/>
charming old Grist Mill, past a pond with Swans swimming. As we were <br/>
looking at the clues for the final clue, I looked up and said "it <br/>
should be right where those kids are". As we approached, the mother <br/>
was sitting in the woods, box in hand, looking like she got caught<br/>
with her hand in the cookie jar. The father was coming out onto the <br/>
path and I asked them if they were the Collins family. Conveneintly <br/>
located a little farther up the path was a little playground. We <br/>
introduced ourselves and shared some letterboxing stories while the <br/>
kids played on the swings. We were all very excited. After finding <br/>
500 boxes, this was our first official exchange on the trail. We did<br/>
all the stamping while the mosquitos had their dinner, exchanged <br/>
addresses and e-mails. They are on their way to Maine, (Portland and <br/>
Bar Harbor) and then up to Canada. After we said our goodbyes, we <br/>
stopped at the GristMill Tavern and headed home.<br/>
Thanks for letting me share our little adventures!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for sharing your adventures at sea with us. It's nice to see a return to <br/>
letterboxing stories [and a sense of humour] to the posts. They have been <br/>
absent too long. Hope this signals a return to "normal" again!<br/>
