&gt; What I have found the most discouraging watching the posts the past <br/>
&gt; couple of days is that what began as a few people openly expressing <br/>
&gt; their points of view has come down to name calling, particularly by <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; few newer members.  While it is understandable that not everyone <br/>
will <br/>
&gt; see things the same way, this is an open list and anyone should feel <br/>
&gt; free to post their questions or perspectives on things without being <br/>
&gt; ridiculed.  We have not resorted to calling you snot-nosed newbies, <br/>
&gt; so please refrain from calling us grumps, grouches and sourpusses.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And as for the grumps "getting out and going letterboxing a little <br/>
&gt; more..."  Those are awfully big words from a relative newbie to <br/>
folks <br/>
&gt; who have found and placed hundreds of boxes and each personally <br/>
&gt; played a part in shaping the direction of the hobby.  Or perhaps you <br/>
&gt; weren't aware of that because they don't feel the need to post a <br/>
&gt; sitrep every time they find a box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I find it interesting that the majority of objections and vocal <br/>
posts <br/>
&gt; are coming from newer members of the group, while all of the <br/>
&gt; supportive and encouraging e-mail I have received has been from <br/>
folks <br/>
&gt; who have been around here for a while.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are not alientating the newbies, they seem to be doing a pretty <br/>
&gt; good job of that themselves.<br/>
