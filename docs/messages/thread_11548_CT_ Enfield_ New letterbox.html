Powder Hollow Enfield, CT 06082<br/>
<br/>
Placed By Demisida, Keep the Mystery and gang, sometime last fall <br/>
(2002); never posted it :( <br/>
<br/>
Easy short hike, about 1/2 hour.  Great for dogs and kids.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Powder Hollow Enfield, CT  Take 140 East to the <br/>
intersection of North Maple street and Hazard Ave (Hazard Ave is 140) <br/>
At that light take a  right and proceed down the hill.  There is <br/>
parking at the red Powder Hollow barn (not on Monday eves, they have <br/>
auction night).<br/>
<br/>
Proceed out of the lot on  foot over the Scantic river on the bridge, <br/>
it's narrow 1 car at a time. Stay  to the left of the bridge.  See <br/>
the cement pylons on your left.  Up and over you go or for the less <br/>
adventurous you can go around.=)    The river will flow westerly on <br/>
your left.   Start counting your paces at the back of the pylon, I <br/>
counted as each foot hit the earth.....34 paces to the fork.  Let's <br/>
get a better look at this flowing beauty, down the hill to your <br/>
left.  The puppy's loving the water but, watch the flow  the current <br/>
can be very strong.  Up just ahead there is a splash and wading pool  <br/>
for you and the kiddies.  Ah, rest a bit maybe have a picnic then  <br/>
begin again.  Before you,  you will see an old red stone foundation.  <br/>
At its lowest point you must once again up and over.  At the roots do <br/>
not trip, countinue along this path close to the river.  Enjoy the <br/>
birches young and old, even broken.  A pine grove you will see and <br/>
smell, continue that path that is heading to the east. A pine tree <br/>
split and fallen with a notch at the base, is this the spot?  No, I <br/>
think not.  Follow the path around the river aways  and down in the <br/>
middle of the  path 2 mighty pines you will come upon.  They appeaar <br/>
to be hugging, stay  to the right of the majestic beauties and  <br/>
travel up the small incline along the rivers edge.  Do not stray from <br/>
the path.  Be wise for very near is what you seek.  To your left a <br/>
fallen beech?( not sure of the tree) but it's definately  on its <br/>
side.  To your  right a rotten stump, which seems better for our box <br/>
to rest?  Now its time for you  to guess.  Hidden under the bark and <br/>
leaves its the treasure that no one sees.  Take a moment to sit on <br/>
the beech? watch the water glisten and to its song listen..  Now <br/>
replace the box the way its was found and to get home simply turn <br/>
around.<br/>
