    I am not a GeoCacher.  I ran across this exchange while <br/>
researching a letterbox.  This is not the first time I have heard of <br/>
crossovers between the two sports.  SOME people even practice both.  <br/>
However, if your stamp is missing, and there is a rabbit's foot <br/>
instead, this may be the reason!<br/>

A Note regarding the log posted by TheHuntingHounds on 1/1/2002. They <br/>
did not actually find the cache. There is a letter box stash placed <br/>
very near the GeoCache in a simple plastic tupperware container <br/>
containing a log book and rubber stamp. I suspect this stash has been <br/>
abandoned since it hasn't been serviced in quite a while. The <br/>
GeoCache is in a large ammunition box hidden under a tree while the <br/>
letter box stash is under a boulder.<br/>

This was our second geocaching expedition and we were able to find <br/>
this one without the GPS. On our way to the overlook, we met up with <br/>
a few people who were novices like us, but they also found the cache. <br/>
The only items in the box were the log, a pen, a pencil and the <br/>
rubber stamp. We left a bandana and furry mouse and took nothing. The <br/>
box was kind of small, but we did our best to get it closed. The <br/>
views were great and the hike was great for kids. <br/>

&gt; This is a good example for why the letterbox should have come kind of<br/>
&gt; business card or letter in it stating that it is a letterbox...... <br/>
<br/>
Or why they should be so brain-stoppingly hard that this sort of thing<br/>
won't occur in practice (although mine aren't even hard enough anymore;<br/>
there's some d**m good letterboxers out there ...)<br/>
<br/>
