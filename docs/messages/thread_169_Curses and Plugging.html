<br/>
There has been talk of curses... mostly from me.  For those who didn't get it,<br/>
this was meant to be humorous.  Not to say that I have no intention of placing<br/>
the poem on some (but not all) of my letterboxes.  However, it will be placed<br/>
there in the spirit of fun and laughter, not as a serious threat.  I will not<br/>
be reciting any incantaions or invoking any spirits near my letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
If I choose to place this verse, or any other light-hearted messages inside my<br/>
boxes, they will be in addition to a label which I have been including in all<br/>
my boxes which explains that the box was placed for all to enjoy and pleads<br/>
for the finder not to 'remove or deface this landmark'.  The label also gives<br/>
my phone number and email address, for contact.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea I wish to address is the notion of 'plugging'.  Please remember<br/>
that the informal rules we have inherited from Dartmoor require us to respect<br/>
the land.  These rules discourage the disturbance of natural surroundings and<br/>
the breaking of sod.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying that I totally oppose plugging -- just that it must be done<br/>
with taste and respect.  It should probably not be attempted in areas where<br/>
the grass dies and the ground freezes.  When you do make a plug, make it deep<br/>
enough that the roots stay intact so the grass will survive.  Also, plugs<br/>
should be visited regularly, so that grass roots do not bind the opening shut<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
If you cover your hiding place with a grass plug, or even whith a rock or<br/>
piece of wood, you need to be very specific in your clues.  Make sure your<br/>
clues lead exactly to the location in question, so that its seekers will have<br/>
no trouble determining which rock to move, or where to look for the plug.  We<br/>
can't encourage people to go around randomly disturbing rock formations or<br/>
tearing up the turf.  If your box is covered with a grass plug, please state<br/>
this fact in your clues.<br/>

I thought the curses were definitely tongue in cheek.  I found them amusing<br/>
with a real message.  I didn't think of them as sincere threats or in any<br/>
way antagonistic...I like 'em!<br/>
