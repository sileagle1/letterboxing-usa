today and found all four boxes recently planted by Fudrick and <br/>
DVN2RCKR.  Even though we were one of the first 4 visitors to <br/>
these boxes,  a little bird made it to each one before us.  We <br/>
seem to be always be following Hoopoe wherever we go <br/>
*smiles*   <br/>
<br/>
Burfoot is a great park and like Fudrick, we already had 3 boxes <br/>
earmarked for placement there when DVN2RCKR beat us there.  <br/>
With dvn2rckr's 2 and Fudrick's 2  already there we figured <br/>
adding our 3 to make 7 would be overkill.  We decided to take <br/>
our 3 to another nearby park.  There are already 3 other boxes <br/>
planted in this other park but since it is much larger than Burfoot <br/>
we figured it could stand a few more.  One of the boxes listed <br/>
there is actually missing (at least we could not find it last August <br/>
or today) and the other pair are notoriously  difficult to find.  Just <br/>
ask Hoopoe, her trials have turned up nothing but errors there.  <br/>
Hopefully our new 3 boxes will entice that bird to come back and <br/>
try(ial) again.<br/>
<br/>
While roaming Burfoot we caught an East Coast Crab but it was <br/>
too small to keep (even if it was full of dungeness) so and we <br/>
decided let him go in that formerly mentioned other park not too <br/>
far away.  It was nice to see some east coast letterboxer's sig <br/>
stamps.  Thanks to Amanda from Seattle for bringing it out to this <br/>
side of the continent. Hope that this wayward crustacean can <br/>
make its way back home so its creator can see where it has <br/>
been.<br/>
<br/>
All in all it was a great day of 'boxing on Boxing Day.  Thanks to <br/>
the English for another fine activity.<br/>
