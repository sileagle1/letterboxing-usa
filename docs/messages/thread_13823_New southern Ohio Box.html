Salamander.  Location: Ross County, Ohio. Difficulty: Moderate.   <br/>
CLUES: This letterbox is located in Grandview Cemetery, Chillicothe, <br/>
Ohio. You must first find the "Patriot Square" Revolutionary War <br/>
Memorial. Stand in front of the marker and take a reading of 285 <br/>
degrees. Go 23 paces at that heading to a smooth-trunked tree which <br/>
has seven lines of words carved into the trunk. Standing at the <br/>
west/northwest side of this tree, take a reading of 300 degrees. 37 <br/>
paces at this heading will bring you to a large tree. Check around <br/>
the nooks and crannies at the base of the tree--- you should find <br/>
Fred! NOTE: Microbox--please bring pen and stamp pad.<br/>

Ross County, Ohio. Difficulty: Moderate. **This box is located in <br/>
Grandview Cemetery, Chillicothe, Ohio. CLUES: Enter the cemetery at <br/>
the Brookside Drive/Bellview Ave. entrance. Shortly after driving <br/>
through the gates, you will come to a road which turns off to the <br/>
left. Take this turn. Immediately after making the turn, look to the <br/>
right. You should see 2 large pine trees which would be about 25 <br/>
paces away from the road if on foot. These 2 trees lie roughly on a <br/>
southwest/northeast line. Find a safe place to park and walk to the <br/>
northeasternmost tree. Standing at its south side take a reading of <br/>
187 degrees. Go 39 paces at this heading to an old splintered stump.  <br/>
The box is hidden within the stump, under some leaves and pieces of <br/>
wood. ( And coming soon to a hiding place near you---well, within <br/>
driving distance, anyway--" Taking 'Stock #2"!! Watch for it!). <br/>
