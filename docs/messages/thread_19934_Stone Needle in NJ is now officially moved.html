<br/>
It's in the same general area and the first 6 clues are the same.  <br/>
The walk is much shorter.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm a little apprehensive about the new location since it's more <br/>
vulnerable to vandelism, but there isn't a concern about destroying <br/>
undergrowth unnecessarily now.  I think it's worth the risk.  I left <br/>
a temporary box with directions at the old site which I'm going to <br/>
remove in about a month.  It's an A&amp;P sandwich container with a <br/>
note.  However, it doesn't have the rymne in the official clues which <br/>
I wrote later.<br/>
<br/>
So here it is:<br/>
<br/>
Stone Needle in NJ<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the state I am in, how high can you go?<br/>
The answer to that question Mr. Kuser did know.<br/>
<br/>
He knew it quite well, but now he is gone.<br/>
And in the stone needle the answer lives on.<br/>
<br/>
For the ultimate sacrifice it points to the sky.<br/>
So show some reverence as you draw nigh.<br/>
<br/>
So find the stone needle and stand way below.<br/>
Where you pay to see far is the first place you should go.<br/>
<br/>
Stand between those devices and admire the view.<br/>
You'll know you're all right if the stone needle is 217 true.<br/>
<br/>
Now to the Needle take those devices and point them.<br/>
Add the numbers on their dials to 265 to go then.<br/>
<br/>
Walk thirty-eight paces crossing drive and guide rail.<br/>
To a tree white as snow on the course of a trail.<br/>
<br/>
When facing the tree turn left on that trail (SW)<br/>
Go 70 double-steps to where you might rest your tail<br/>
<br/>
Northwest you might turn for a good 3-state view<br/>
But due east (90) is the heading of the very last clue.<br/>
<br/>
Now 19 paces to what geologists might call "Erratic."<br/>
If the Stone Needle is at 202 you'll know that you're at it.<br/>
<br/>
IMPORTANT NOTES!<br/>
<br/>
1) This is a very high traffic area.  Be careful to conceal the box <br/>
as good as you can.  There are many tourists during the warm months.<br/>
<br/>
2) I've corrected the declination to 13 degrees west.  If you don't <br/>
have that setting you'll have to add 13 <br/>
to all the bearings.<br/>
<br/>
3) All my paces are 2 steps each.  <br/>
<br/>
4) This is a summit environment and although it is not high risk, <br/>
there can be hazards in poor and icy weather conditions.<br/>
<br/>
5) Also, there's lots of rocks and  crevaces which means snakes and <br/>
other nasties.  <br/>
<br/>
6) You should always be very close to a parking lot.  If you find <br/>
yourself decending into deep woods, turn back and check the clues.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
