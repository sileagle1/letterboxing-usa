I think the original poster is under the impression that letterboxes are allowed in state parks but maybe the area they placed their letterbox was not considered kosher by the park rangers for safety reasons or otherwise. <br/>
<br/>
It's funny the ranger was so against the letterbox, my friends and I met a park ranger who is also a letterboxer a few weeks ago, we met him because we were trying to non-chalantley stamp a letterbox and he stopped to ask us where we found it; we thought we were in trouble at first we told him were we found it but then he told us he had placed a letterbox near the same area. He then proceeded to tell us about the other letterboxes that were in the park. He gave us one of the park stickers as an exchange. We were following a series trail, it wouldn't surprise me if he was the placer and was excited to see people finding them. <br/>
<br/>
The best thing I can say to the original poster is to learn from the experience and place a new box some where else. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't know about state parks anywhere else but Texas, but I do know that<br/>
in Texas our state park system is under financial seige, with closures and<br/>
cutbacks looming over every park.  Many parks are left unstaffed or<br/>
minimally staffed on weekdays.  I would imagine Texas isn't alone in this<br/>
situation, especially since Texas has always prided itself on its park<br/>
system, so that our parks have been protected from financial considerations<br/>
long after they became a problem.<br/>
<br/>
When parks are struggling to have enough staff to clean bathrooms, how can I<br/>
expect them to call me and ask me about my box, especially if it wasn't<br/>
supposed to be there in the first place?  As Mosey said, it IS our<br/>
responsibility to know what is allowed and what isn't, and it certainly<br/>
isn't the park's responsibility to educate me in that respect.  I always<br/>
find it refreshing when I hear that a ranger contacts a letterboxer to offer<br/>
to return the box or help them re-plant it in a better place, and that<br/>
happens quite often, but it is a nicety not a necessity.<br/>
<br/>
Now I do agree with David's point that letterboxers create park traffic<br/>
which in turn generates funds and supports leaving parks open.  We have a<br/>
few forward-thinking park rangers around here that recognize that fact and<br/>
generously work with letterboxers and geocachers, but our state also has<br/>
state park regulations that came about because some treasure-hunters were<br/>
irresponsible in their activities.   Clearly we can be a problem and a<br/>
blessing all wrapped into one package.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to make the point that we as letterboxers should be diligent to<br/>
pay our fees and sign guest books, and to offer service to our parks, and to<br/>
give feedback in hopes we can demonstrate our desire to be responsible and<br/>
supportive park users.  Hopefully by supporting them, they will see their<br/>
way clear to support us.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When reading this message, this all sounds familiar to me.  I am not sure if this is the exact box I was looking for or not, as the one I was looking for was listed as an orpan.  (I did email the placer of my findings, which is what makes me think this is the box that team-new-hampshire is referring to).  I was recently looking for a box in a national park, but found nothing.  The next day we were in a location where there were employees from the park as well as other organizations for a nature education program.  There happened to be a letterbox hidden in the area of this program.  The park employee had a discussion with another in my party about the park, nature, conservation, etc.  They were standing in a location where they could see footprints in the sand to the letterbox hidden at this location, which led to conversation, initiated by the park employee, about letterboxing.  He stated that they are fighting letterboxes in the national park because it is creating trails<br/>
 being cut into nature areas where there shouldn't be trails.  He did say that it may come to a point where placers will need to ask permission to place the boxes, then they can control the location.  This person never said that he got rid of the box, but I think we can deduct that "we are fighting letterboxes in the park" + a letterbox that can't be found could possibly equal that it was removed on purpose.  <br/>
<br/>
  No park employees saw us looking for the letterbox in the national park.  The information that I learned came from a chance conversation with the park employee in a different location.  We did use discretion in our searches.  If this box and the box I was searching for are actually two different boxes, then this just brings to light a trend that is developing.<br/>
<br/>
  All said, it was a great day and we had fun looking for the box!!<br/>

&gt; How and why did the lady come to be informed by a park ranger that <br/>
the box<br/>
&gt; had been tossed?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That was my first question when I read about it. <br/>
<br/>
I once had a letterboxer send me a note saying that they were having <br/>
trouble finding one of my boxes, but it "turned out ok" because the <br/>
groundskeeper told them where it was! I was mortified. Did they ask him <br/>
where it was? Or did he see them poking around in the bushes? How did <br/>
he know it was there? How many other letterboxers had he watched poking <br/>
around? (Luckily he didn't seem to care about it being there. It stayed <br/>
for about another 8 months before I was asked, by the owner of the <br/>
property, to come remove it.)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This completely depends on the state parks in question. NC requires <br/>
a special use permit which costs $30, but it is at the discretion of <br/>
each park manager as to whether that is a one-time fee, an every-<br/>
three-months fee or something in between. It's also up to the <br/>
manager whether the boxes can be permitted at all in a given park. <br/>
NC State Forests OTOH turn a blind eye seemingly. Some conservation <br/>
lands allow them; some don't.<br/>
<br/>
Other state park groups seem to welcome them. Some places hunt them <br/>
down like rabid dogs and destroy them.<br/>
<br/>
National Parks are a no-no, as far as planting. Definite rules <br/>
against it and they could levy fines against you for it.<br/>
<br/>
Basically it is the planter's job to know where it's allowed and <br/>
where not. If the planter chooses to ignore the rules, be prepared <br/>
to possibly lose a box.<br/>

letterboxes in state parks, is this not the case? I thought it was <br/>
conservation lands that it was big no, no. I 'm not trying to start <br/>
anything here just trying to get some clarification. I think the <br/>
original poster is under the impression that letterboxes are allowed <br/>
in state parks but maybe the area they placed their letterbox was <br/>
not considered kosher by the park rangers for safety reasons or <br/>
otherwise. <br/>
