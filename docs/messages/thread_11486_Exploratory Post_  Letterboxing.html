Highlight Letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
Exploratory Post is an intergenerational, family program series providing<br/>
children and their adult companions with fun and unique ways to interact<br/>
with postal history.  The content and activities of each program focus on a<br/>
theme applied to an exploration of related areas in the Museum galleries and<br/>
a selection of hands-on and educational activities.  In April, Exploratory<br/>
Post will be highlighting Letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
This program will provide a basic introductory overview of letterboxing to<br/>
program participants.  The program is free and open to all members of the<br/>
public, although groups larger than 10, please call in advance, (202)<br/>
