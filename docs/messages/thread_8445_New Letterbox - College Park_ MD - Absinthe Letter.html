Directions: Find your way to Lake Artemesia in the College Park/Greenbelt <br/>
Area. The turn off for the lake is located at Branchville Road off of MD <br/>
route 193 in Greenbelt. The winding road takes you past the Washington Post <br/>
Plant, and right to the parking area for Lake Artemesia.<br/>
 Walk to the Lake. When you arrive, the path splits around the lake. Take the <br/>
left fork. When you come to a bridge on your right (and a splitting of the <br/>
path), Take the left-most fork into the woods and away from the lake. Do not <br/>
cross the new bridge that appears on your path - instead, hang a right on <br/>
Indian Creek Trail. Follow the trail until it turns by the NorthEast Branch <br/>
Trail. Instead of turning, keep walking straight on the NorthEast Branch <br/>
Trail. <br/>
  At the Paint Branch Bridge, stop at the foot of the bridge. Notice a trail <br/>
into the woods at 150 degrees. Try not to notice the other trails into the <br/>
woods at this point. Walk along this trail until you notice a huge, huge, <br/>
double tree on the left. The box is snug in the crook of the tree.<br/>
