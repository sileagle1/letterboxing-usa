"Initial Point" <br/>
Kuna, Idaho<br/>
Ada County<br/>
Placed by A&amp;J-Bear on 22 December 2002<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From I84 take exit 44 south on route 69 for about 8 <br/>
miles.  Turn left onto Swan Falls Road and follow that road for about <br/>
8 miles.  Turn left when you see the sign for Initial Point.  Drive <br/>
on that dirt road for about a mile.  At the Y park on the road <br/>
leading up to the hill.<br/>
<br/>
Level of Difficulty:  Steep hike (especially if you try to take a <br/>
short cut up the rocks.)<br/>
<br/>
Initial Point Clues:<br/>
Follow the rocky road up and around to the top of the hill.  Take <br/>
Andrew and Martin's steps up.  Find the survey marker and make your <br/>
way to it.  From Initial Point carefully find your way to the yellow <br/>
hand.  Take six steps 130 degrees from the hand to an opening in the <br/>
rocks.  Behind some smaller rocks is your box.   Hide it well because <br/>
if you don't the locals will nab it for sure.  If here on a clear day <br/>
enjoy the view.  <br/>
<br/>
Please read the waiver of responsibility and watch out for snakes <br/>
(not that we saw any, but all the rocks seem like a snake's haven).<br/>
