<br/>
New to the list but i wanted to comment on a few of the topics in one <br/>
fell swoop.<br/>
<br/>
a) removal of vandalized pages...  I would take a bit of paper and some <br/>
tape, and provided the book is not wet, I would make an impromptu <br/>
modesty sleeve, with a message stating that the images in the sleeve <br/>
may not be intended for the eyes of little viewers.  Then drop a note <br/>
to the placer, and let them know the deal.<br/>
<br/>
b) stamp carving...  truthfully, you can do a fine job with an old pink <br/>
pearl eraser, (of the white staedler ones)  and a pointy  (#10) X-acto  <br/>
blade.  I've been using the Speedball Easy-cut linoleum blocks.  this <br/>
material is really soft and cuts like butter.  As for the hard grey <br/>
burlap backed linoleum, I wouldn't recommend it, unless it is mounted <br/>
on a wood block, because it gets brittle when cold, and if used, or <br/>
dropped, it may snap, and damage the stamp.  If you are looking for <br/>
nice carving tools try Graphic Chemical ( <br/>
http://www.graphicchemical.com/ )<br/>
<br/>
c)image transfer... you can take your image, color graphite pencil all <br/>
over the backside, place on your carving medium, and then trace your <br/>
design.  Where you trace will transfer the image to the carving medium. <br/>
Though drawing directly on the medium with a ball point pen works just <br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
d)image sharing... I haven't come across any image sharing... but I <br/>
will probably create a "friendship stamp"  which is different than my <br/>
"letterbox stamp"  or i would sign it differently... or something.<br/>
<br/>
Here's to finding all you seek!<br/>

&gt; According to the FAQ...<br/>
&gt;  "Should I Keep My Stamps Secret?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It is Dartmoor tradition to keep your personal stamp secret,<br/>
&gt;  however I'm probably just about the only North American who follows<br/>
&gt;  this tradition these days, most people like to exchange personal<br/>
&gt;  images when they meet. Some people keep the box stamps secret and but<br/>
&gt;  most do not. I keep them secret because it adds mystery to the game,<br/>
&gt;  but it is up to you. Never scan other peoples' stamps you have found<br/>
&gt;  and post them to the Internet without the hiders' permission. Of<br/>
&gt;  course, showing your stamp book at a gathering in a pub is part of the<br/>
&gt;  fun ... :-)"<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Be careful sending out stamp images that you've found. A lot of people<br/>
&gt;  that plant lboxes do NOT want these images floating around without<br/>
&gt;  their permission. Personally, I wouldn't grant permission to send out<br/>
&gt;  my stamp images. The fun of it is finding the box and then seeing the<br/>
&gt;  stamp image.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Just my opinion,<br/>

Works great for folks that can draw. My method of transfer is geared <br/>
toward folks that can't or won't draw their images on the medium. Try <br/>
the blender pen sometime and you'll find a new way. Please try it b/4 <br/>
you dismiss it. I have a lot of problems with that from old-schoolers <br/>
(Ryan have you used the blender pen yet? I didn't think so...)<br/>
