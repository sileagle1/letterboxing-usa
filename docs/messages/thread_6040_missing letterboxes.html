<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Searched for the 2 letterboxes south of Anchorage, AK on July 5,<br/>
&gt; 2002. The clues seemed easy to follow but there was no sign of the<br/>
&gt; letterboxes themselves.  Either they were too well hidden after the<br/>
&gt; last clue or they have been removed from the sight. the owner might<br/>
&gt; want to check on them.<br/>

Hi thanks Kathy, we replaced Paddle Last week and You Otter also. <br/>
Otter is in a new nearby  spot and I sent in a update to the clues I <br/>
will look through the archives for it tommmorow and post that <br/>
again.Paddle is in the same spot lets hope sticky fingers Courtney <br/>
doesn't feel like walking there again. Leader of the pack<br/>
