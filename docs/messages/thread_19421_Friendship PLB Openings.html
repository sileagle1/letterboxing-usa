the corner (how time flies).  I have a box that I am planning that will<br/>
honor Friendship Day (Aug 1).<br/>
<br/>
The list will close after the first 25 responses.  (email them to me<br/>
privately at dscott5377 at earthlink dot net)  You MUST keep the subject<br/>
of the email AS IS or your reply will get directed to the wrong place<br/>
and you will lose your place in the first 25 responses.<br/>
<br/>
This is child or adult oriented.  It does have a small "Craft" project<br/>
that will be included (1 per address).  So, if you don't like crafts,<br/>
please don't ask to be on this list.  <br/>
<br/>
Remember, this is to honor Friends, so your "Craft" is to give to your<br/>
best friend =]<br/>
<br/>
The package will weigh about 1 pound and I will REQUIRE Priority Mail<br/>
WITH Delivery Confirmation.<br/>
<br/>
Ready?  GO!    =]<br/>
