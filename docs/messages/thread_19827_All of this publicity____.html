<br/>
We've all been talking a lot lately about the loss or destruction of <br/>
boxes due to all of the newfound publicity.  Rightfully so, I think, <br/>
but just remember to look up from your clue sheet from time to time <br/>
to see if there is anyone else around you.  Think about it....people <br/>
not really paying attention to their surroundings, sometimes out <br/>
where no one else can hear or see you....the perfect place for some <br/>
of the world's scary people to find us unsuspecting, good <br/>
hearted, "wanna' exchange stamps?" letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the scariness....my husband is a police officer and has <br/>
been on my case about this lately...he won't let me go any more <br/>
unless I agree to leave him a copy of the clue sheets for the boxes <br/>
that I'm going to find!  <br/>

Happy SAFE trails,<br/>
