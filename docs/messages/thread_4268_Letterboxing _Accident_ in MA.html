HEADLINE: "In light of unfortunate accident "pusher" accused of <br/>
introducing Ginger Venti to Letterboxing "Hobby" issues apology."<br/>
<br/>
In a emotionally charged interview Deanne Bellefeuille-Besnia the <br/>
person accused of introducing Ginger Venti to Letterboxing issued an <br/>
apology to Ginger, her husband and children, the Ledwell family, and <br/>
all others in the free world who love and respect Ginger. "I had no <br/>
idea that when I told her about it she would become so addicted. I <br/>
thought it was just a harmless thing." One of the spectators at the <br/>
interview noted the reluctance of Ms. Bellefeuille-Besnia to actually <br/>
use the term "letterboxing" speculating that she wants to distance <br/>
the sport from this unfortunate occurance. "I just, like, wanted to <br/>
share my new hobby with somebody and Ginger was, like, the first <br/>
person who actually listened when I talked about it. I kinda noticed <br/>
that she got a glazed and possessed look in her eyes when she saw the <br/>
Rubbermaid container I was planning on using but I thought it was, <br/>
like, just a coincidence." When "the poison ivy incident" was <br/>
mentioned the accused just shrugged and said "Well, that's nothing, I <br/>
wrecked one of my good sweaters doing it when I got caught in a bunch <br/>
of picker bushes and I didn't think that was any big deal, I'm pretty <br/>
sure that Ginger got over the poison ivy but my sweater is still <br/>
wrecked."  At this point several members of the press in attendance <br/>
could be seen shaking their heads and murmuring "denial". Asked if <br/>
she had any plans to join Ginger in rehab Ms. Bellefeuille-Besnia <br/>
said "Yeah, I might go over and see her when no one else is around, <br/>
we can talk about movies and stuff." The press conference ended <br/>
abruptly when the accused knocked her purse over and several small <br/>
ink pads and an empty plastic margarine container spilled out "Hey, <br/>
where'd that come from? I think someone is trying to frame me. I <br/>
swear I was clean when I came in here." As she was led to the door <br/>
she was observed asking her husband David if they might stop by <br/>
Michael's Craft Store on the way home because she needed to get <br/>
some "stuff." When asked "what stuff?" she said, "ummm, I don't <br/>
know.silk flowers or maybe a flower pot". Unfortunately everyone <br/>
there knows that Ms. Bellefeuille-Besnia has no talent whatsoever <br/>
when it comes to flower arranging. Will it take another senseless <br/>
tragedy to bring these addicts to their senses? Only time will tell. <br/>
