Robert Penn Warren poetry museum in Guthrie, KY. It is stored away <br/>

If you have a similar type of set-up in mind, the library needs to <br/>
make sure that staff and volunteers know about the box.<br/>

I placed Smokin' Fish in my local library <http: <br="" www.letterboxing.org="">
BoxView.asp?boxnum=8311&amp;boxname=Smokin'_Fish&gt;. The librarian was<br/>
very receptive and the staff has enjoyed having visitors.<br/>
<br/>
When I went to ask permission, I brought the Smithsonian article, an "About <br/>
Letterboxing" FAQ sheet, and examples of other library letterboxes.  The LB <br/>
had to be approved by the library board, so I was glad I had "built my case."<br/>

This is one of the coolest library boxes I have seen. You might want <br/>
to contact Leslie, the box owner. They might have some insight for <br/>
you.<br/>

  I've been to two library boxes.  Both were made out of key holders that <br/>
  magnetically attach to the inside of the car.  What the planters did was to put a <br/>
  tiny stamp inside the key holder along with a tiny logbook.  THen it was placed <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The library letterbox I saw in a hollow book, placed incognito, was <br/>
really fun, but did not last for very long.  The library moves stuff <br/>
around all the time and probably discovered and removed it.<br/>
<br/>
Another library had a letterboxer on staff.  She placed 3 hollowed <br/>
out books with permission.  The library had a problem with them <br/>
because people kept trying to check them out.  They worked though.  <br/>
I placed The Letterbox Book box there, also with permission.  She <br/>
left and took the books with her.  The staff all changed and my book <br/>
went missing after a several months.  <br/>
<br/>
I would like to try adding to an appropriate book as opposed to <br/>
hollowing it out and cutting out its text.  Take it apart.  Add <br/>
enough pages to it to hollow out and hide the stamp in.  Tie the <br/>
stamp in carefully with strong ribbon.  Leave enough white space on <br/>
those pages to use for the log.  Rebind it (Kinkos?).  It is still a <br/>
real book and can be labeled and cataloged.  You might have to <br/>
replace the stamp once in a while but the library wouldn't pull it <br/>
since it's "real".<br/>
<br/>
My local librarian didn't seem friendly so I have not tried this <br/>
yet.  <br/>
<br/>
You asked about clues.  See The Letterbox Book in Northern Virginia, <br/>
Prince William County, Manassass.  Fieldbook of American Wildflowers <br/>
in Loudoun County went missing pretty quickly but I think the clues <br/>
are still there.<br/>

Grumpy,<br/>
I realize that you didn't mention the name of this letterbox, but <br/>
with the discription you posted it was fairly obvious to me where <br/>
the letterbox was. You basically posted a way to shortcut the clues <br/>
and spoiled the adventure and adrenalin rush a finder would attain <br/>
during the search for this letterbox. Please be cautious about <br/>
posting information about an individual letterbox. Thanks.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Several Western Washington libraries placed letterboxes either <br/>
within their libraries and/or on the library grounds as part of the <br/>
summer youth program this past year.  It appears that most, if not <br/>
all, were fully sanctioned by the library system as some of them <br/>
even have giant 'letterbox stamp' posters on the walls within that <br/>
included little tidbits about the hobby and how to find more <br/>
information on letterboxing.  As I don't recognize any of the <br/>
letterbox 'planters' by name, I'm not sure if these boxes were a <br/>
result of one person's diligent coordinations with the library <br/>
system or if they were a result of just a bunch of folks who <br/>
recently learned about the hobby and were encouraged to place one at <br/>
their local libraries.<br/>
<br/>
To avoid problems with disappearing boxes, it seems that most of the <br/>
boxes are hidden somewhere around the 'references' section and have <br/>
even been entered into the system as a book--complete with dewey <br/>
decimal system info and are labelled as references so people won't <br/>
inadvertantly check them out.  The clues often required a multi-<br/>
stepped 'card catalog' hunt for the exact location.  The containers <br/>
were often narrow/thin but large 'tin' containers that blended well <br/>
with other books on the shelf yet they were large enough to contain <br/>
the typical letterbox contents one would expect to find.<br/>

 I did not ask permission although one of the librarians was the one<br/>
who showed me the book on letterboxing in the first place. I was<br/>
hoping that that librarian would be the first finder and I kept it a<br/>
secret for a couple of months until a hitchhiker showed up and I just<br/>
had to show her.<br/>
However, when I made the book, which is hollowed out, I looked<br/>
carefully at the books on the shelf and chose a book that looked like<br/>
it belonged there and I copied the exact format and typeset of the<br/>
label on the spine.  I did not however give it the barcode that our<br/>
library uses so no one could check it out even if they took it up to<br/>
the desk. I also chose a book that I felt would not be likely to get<br/>
checked out, in this case the title was The Set Point Weight Loss<br/>
Cookbook. I felt like the balance between a book that no one would<br/>
want to check out and a book that would not get removed from the shelf<br/>
was a fine line. <br/>
So for a long time I kept very quiet about this and did not share it<br/>
with any of the other librarians until one day the book disappeared<br/>
from the shelf.  After much to-do on my part I found out that the<br/>
librarian had told the head of our Library Friends group that she<br/>
could borrow it to show to some other people and when she was donewith<br/>
it she put it on the to-be-shelved pile! Oh Yikes I thought. But when<br/>
I called and talked to the person on duty it turns out that all the<br/>
librarians were familiar with the letterbox and it just had not been<br/>
reshelved due to it's special nature and a busy night. <br/>
So I don't know about your library, but my initial feelings were a<br/>
don't ask don't tell policy even though I felt that I was risking<br/>
losing the letterbox in exchange for not being told no. Plus I love<br/>
pushing that envelope.......<br/>
Good luck<br/>
Nisha<br/>
PS The letterbox is in Utah. Come on over, we need more boxers in this<br/>
state and if you give prior notice I will even try to get you a<br/>
special token or something in the box.<br/>

This has nothing to do with the size of the state or how long a <br/>
letterbox has gone without finders. Short cuts,and spoilers should <br/>
never be posted on this or any other chat list. If the planter <br/>
wishes to advise about a short cut they could do so in their clues.<br/>
I'm sure that Grumpy Grinch didn't realize that he was posting <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I work in a library, so have been watching this discussion with interest.  My opinion as a librarian?  Library directors would likely embrace and assist with a letterbox hidden in their library.  In this day of shrinking and disappearing budgets, "gate count" is very important to prove our value and worth.  The more people in the door, for whatever reason, is a good thing. <br/>
<br/>
I also think, knowing the mechanics of a working library, that a secretly-placed letterbox is doomed for a short existence.  It may appear to the outside world that an uncataloged mock book that looks like others near it might remain undetected for years, or that a secret magnetic container secured under a shelf would never be found, or that surely no one has touched those government document collection maps for DECADES...  But, part of our library's routine maintenance is shelf-washing, which includes removing the entire collection of books from a section of shelving and giving it a good wash.  Weeding is also important, so sections of "forgotten" or "never-used" materials are regularly gone through and things discarded.  There is also a lot of "shifting" that goes on, as the collection grows and changes.<br/>
<br/>
This being said, I should also tell you our former library director's mantra:  "It is easier to ask forgiveness than permission."<br/>
<br/>
And watch for a library letterbox hidden by me sometime (a librarian letterboxer is a good thing!)  --Papeseed<br/>

&gt; My daughter and I have placed a letterbox in our local county library.<br/>
&gt;  I did not ask permission although one of the librarians was the one<br/>
&gt; who showed me the book on letterboxing in the first place. I was<br/>
&gt; hoping that that librarian would be the first finder and I kept it a<br/>
&gt; secret for a couple of months until a hitchhiker showed up and I just<br/>
&gt; had to show her.<br/>
&gt; However, when I made the book, which is hollowed out, I looked<br/>
&gt; carefully at the books on the shelf and chose a book that looked like<br/>
&gt; it belonged there and I copied the exact format and typeset of the<br/>
&gt; label on the spine.  I did not however give it the barcode that our<br/>
&gt; library uses so no one could check it out even if they took it up to<br/>
&gt; the desk. I also chose a book that I felt would not be likely to get<br/>
&gt; checked out, in this case the title was The Set Point Weight Loss<br/>
&gt; Cookbook. I felt like the balance between a book that no one would<br/>
&gt; want to check out and a book that would not get removed from the shelf<br/>

Florida, I highly recommend Devonpeter's "Haslam's Books." Very <br/>
challenging and very fun and a very helpful planter. I think <br/>
Devonpeter had gotten permission from the owners, and I hope she <br/>
jumps in here to add something(hint hint). My daughter and I are <br/>
working on a library box, also. I'll let you know how it goes.<br/>
