                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the update Music Woman!  We're very grateful to hear about <br/>
the journeys of our lost luggage.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks also for mentioning the difficulties you had contacting us <br/>
through my yahoo email address.  The address you used below wasn't <br/>
quite right (we're at lb_seekyr@yahoo.com), but even this address <br/>
wasn't set up properly; I was under the mistaken impressesion that <br/>
all messages sent to this address were being sent to my ISP email <br/>
address, since that is where I receive the messages sent to this talk <br/>
list.  Thanks to your note, I checked this and discovered that it's a <br/>
separate account which had just recently been deactivated for lack of <br/>
use.  I'll never know whether we had other mail regarding this <br/>
hitchhiker sent there as the mailbox contents were deleted...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for sending us the history of its travels.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Seekyr, Blaze, and Mobius<br/>

&gt; I tried to send this to your yahoo account directly, but it said <br/>
that you no <br/>
&gt; longer had a yahoo account.<br/>
