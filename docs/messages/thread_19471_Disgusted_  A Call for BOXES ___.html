There are many more reports of found boxes and wonderful trails that <br/>
it would appear the boxes outnumber the 'SABS'.  So rather than <br/>
withdrawing from the planting of boxes - with the possibility of <br/>
destruction - let's plant twice as many.  It will drive the SABS <br/>
crazy and maybe they will self destruct.<br/>

&gt; The best defense against these "Sabs" is a well hid box with a <br/>
tricky <br/>
&gt; clue. A pile of sticks is not well hid, and is just asking to be <br/>
&gt; investigated. <br/>
<br/>
And sometimes a better knowledge of the terrain.  I had a box that <br/>
got washed out --- the first finder reported this and put it back <br/>
with rocks on top to anchor.  The next finder (within 24 hours) said <br/>
they found it washed out and put it back, but it was going to rain <br/>
again.  I can only hope no one drives over it!!  But at this point <br/>
I'm happy soneone got the first finder certificate and if it is <br/>
reported missing I'll pull the clues --- clever as they may be!<br/>
