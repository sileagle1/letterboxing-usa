I am new at Letterboxing but this is my cup of tea.<br/>
<br/>
I run a Summer Camp for children ages 7-12 and we plan on going on a few<br/>
hunts this summer but we don't have a lot to choose from in our area. We<br/>
have done the only one close at UCD, this is where we live.  It may turn out<br/>
that we will just plant the boxes instead of another hunt.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if I could start a group here to encourage more letterboxing<br/>
and make it a little more well known.   I have a friend who writes for the<br/>
local newspaper and I think it would be a great Sunday Sun-Up story.    What<br/>
are the rules about any of this.  My fear is I would open it up to local<br/>
vandals?  <br/>
<br/>
Please e-mail me <br/>
Thanks, Chris<br/>

I know that a conservation commission in a small town in my area did a<br/>
program with the local newspaper  two years ago. They hid a number of boxes<br/>
(15) in their local conservation areas, with the intention of increasing<br/>
the local communities exposure to those areas. Their first article<br/>
explained letterboxing and included the first clue. I'm not sure they ever<br/>
mentioned the letterboxing.org web site - it doesn't need to, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Each week the newspaper would publish the clues for another box. They made<br/>
the clues pretty challenging, and they didn't include driving directions -<br/>
residents needed to have a book of trail maps to the conservation areas,<br/>
which are only available in the town. Because it was a small town, there<br/>
wasn't a lot of wide ranging publicity, so I don't think that would hurt<br/>
our sport/hobby. I think it's a good community service as well.<br/>
<br/>
Also, look at the Valley Quest program notes from today or yesterday -<br/>
those meetings must be publicized somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would love to see you plant some boxes in your area. As you note <br/>
Davis is seriously devoid of boxes. I travel there from the NW on <br/>
business periodically and have scattered a few of my own creations <br/>
along the way but haven't had any but the one in Davis to look for. I <br/>
actually spoke with a writer from the Bee a few months ago who wanted <br/>
to do a story and I have no idea if it ever happened. Personally,  I <br/>
don't think that hordes of hooligans would take to the trails looking <br/>
to rip off letterboxes. In my opinion the bigger risk is hiding them in <br/>
places with too many hooligans there already. Funhog<br/>
