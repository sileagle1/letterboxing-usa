I hope this article gets a few more people hiding and searching for<br/>
boxes in this area.<br/>

I think the article is well written (especially knowing how screwy <br/>
the reporters seem to get things) and informative. There are those <br/>
who might flame you for tipping folks off to cosa nostra ("our <br/>
thing") but... Heck, maybe a couple folks will get into 'boxing <br/>
because of it. Sooner or later folks will find out about the <br/>
pasttime. After all, it was the Smithsonian article that launched the <br/>
North American efforts. Flamers take heed of that.<br/>
<br/>
You showed that some boxes go missing, some are harder to find than <br/>
others. Guess lots of folks have already told you that the clue was <br/>
about a firehouse, right?<br/>
<br/>
I used to live in Zachary in East Baton Rouge parish. Loved the <br/>
people, the music, and the food there. <br/>
