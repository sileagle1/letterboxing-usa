Edward Stratemeyer letterbox<br/>
Union County<br/>
Hillside, NJ<br/>
<br/>
planted by Princess Lea and Amanda from Seattle on May 4, 2003<br/>
no hiking involved<br/>
<br/>
Although you may not recognize the name Edward Stratemeyer, you are probabl=<br/>
y nonetheless familiar with the characters he created who are still with us =<br/>
today, such as Nancy Drew, Frank and Joe Hardy and the Bobbsey Twins. He cre=<br/>
ated the Stratemeyer Syndicate at the turn of the century which broke new gr=<br/>
ound in the world of children's books. The company would hire ghostwriters t=<br/>
o develop books from Stratemeyer's outlines, which he then edited and publis=<br/>
hed under various pen names. The ghostwriters promised not to reveal that th=<br/>
ey had written the books, and were paid a one time fee and no royalties. The=<br/>
 Stratemeyer Syndicate took the risk of publication for these stories - many=<br/>
 were failures, but many were huge successes. The majority of the books publ=<br/>
ished by the syndicate were boys' and girls' series books, many of which con=<br/>
tinue to be enjoyed by today's readers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions: go to the Evergreen Cemetery at 1137 N. Broad St. in Hillside N=<br/>
J<br/>
You'll need to locate the Stratemeyer gravestone, decorated with book desig=<br/>
ns. It is in Section E and faces one of the roads. After paying your respect=<br/>
s, proceed East by Northeast on the path. The second tree on the left is pro=<br/>
tecting the stamp (look high).<br/>

Your message probably DID get sent, it just doesn't come to the<br/>
letterbox-usa message board.  It comes to the letterbox-announce message<br/>
board.  To sign onto that board (and get announcements when boxes are<br/>
planted) just visit  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-announce<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you can also manually list your boxes here as well!  :)  Also -<br/>
my advice is to sign up for the "digest" version of the announcement group.<br/>
The digest sends basically one email per day, with a compilation of all the<br/>
messages.  Then just scroll through the list to see if any are planted in<br/>
your state (and you don't need to bother reading and/or deleting a lot of<br/>
other stuff!)<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>
