<br/>
Arches National Park just outside of Moab, Utah<br/>
<br/>
Box placed on April 27th, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Moab Letterbox is located just off the Delicate Arch <br/>
Trail in Arches National Park near Moab, Utah.  The <br/>
trail is 1.5 miles each way.  The letterbox is <br/>
approximately 1/8th of a mile from the top.  You will <br/>
see one dozen man-made stairs that have been carved out <br/>
of the sandstone trail.  At the base of the stairs turn <br/>
left and step over the log.  Follow the "center" sand <br/>
trail, veer slightly to the right going down a sand <br/>
slope.  Total distance from stair bottom to hiding place <br/>
is approximately 55 paces.  Go up towards the large rock <br/>
face, you'll be directly below the main hiking trail.  <br/>
An arrowhead shaped rock leans against the large <br/>
sandstone rock face.  Letterbox is hidden in small rocks <br/>
surrounding the larger arrowhead rock.  Make sure no <br/>
rattle snakes are hiding in the rocks!  Continue on up <br/>
the trail for a beautiful view of Delicate Arch.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi From Dartmoor...<br/>
<br/>
I was most alarmed and shocked to see the message from "ratpatrolhq" who<br/>
advocated stealth and deception when Letterboxing !<br/>
<br/>
I hope that you won't mind a poor old Brit offering a 2c worth ..<br/>
<br/>
I must start by saying that I (also) don't know the US Parks authorities<br/>
views on Letterboxing..but I certainly do know the UK Parks authority<br/>
views..and you can find 'em yourself on many UK sites...<br/>
<br/>
The Dartmoor Parks folk even publish a short pamphlet on how to be a<br/>
responsible Letterboxer...It's called "Letterboxing with Moor Care"....see<br/>
below<br/>
<br/>
I am saddened that anyone should be ashamed of, or "sneaky" about<br/>
Letterboxing...<br/>
<br/>
It is a happy and naive hobby and certainly nothing to be guilty about...<br/>
<br/>
If the US Parks folk are concerned ...then I am certain they are just<br/>
being careful with the national resource  (and good for that too !) ..and<br/>
as usual with govt depts they are probably one-step behind new<br/>
innovations...<br/>
<br/>
Especially as they assume many will become one-week-wonders....(er I think<br/>
the history of Letterboxing might prove to be a bit longer than that ! <g>)<br/>
<br/>
In the UK our National Parks folk do appreciate that Letterboxing is the<br/>
legitimate "pursuit of happiness"    ...and WE don't even have those words<br/>
in our constitution..<br/>
<br/>
(In fact we don't have a written constitution..but we are "real crazy"<br/>
over here as you are well aware I'm sure <lol>)<br/>
<br/>
They make some sensible suggestions and a few safety rules and as (on the<br/>
whole) most boxers are responsible folk we are happy to abide by em...<br/>
<br/>
We all love our heritage too and Letterboxing gets more folk out enjoying<br/>
it...I see no harm in doing that !  It's what the parks are for..surely !  <br/>
<br/>
Our lovely Dartmoor was even closed for a whole year because of the hoof<br/>
and mouth epidemic..and naturally we stayed away ! <br/>
<br/>
They can't build a wall around Dartmoor....the park rangers just put up a<br/>
few sheets of paper on posts in the ground..and us law abiding Brits (just<br/>
like law abiding Americans would do) ..we stayed away !<br/>
<br/>
So I would say...please don't be ashamed to write a name/address/email in<br/>
your visitors book...it is far more honest and shows no desire to act in a<br/>
criminal way..especially in these sad times...<br/>
<br/>
And if your visitors book is wet/damaged/full then the next boxer can<br/>
call/email you with the news..<br/>
<br/>
If the US Parks folk need help understanding the hobby from a "Parks<br/>
perspective" ..then please show em a copy of the UK parks dept pamphlet...<br/>
<br/>
I do hope that my 2c doesn't offend anyone...I just don't like to see<br/>
anyone advocate being anything other that legal, decent and honest...<br/>
<br/>
....especially about our simple and harmless hobby of Letterboxing...<br/>
<br/>
If responsible Letterboxers place boxes with care and don't damage the<br/>
heritage and maintain the boxes well ..then I can't imagine the grounds<br/>
for any actions...but that's just my opinion (caveat emptor).. <br/>
<br/>
I would be pleased to hear of the US Parks views though ...<br/>
<br/>
The Dartmoor Parks Leaflet in pdf format is on the National Parks<br/>
Authority (UK government) web site (npa.gov) below...<br/>
<br/>
Note: It is printed on Euro A4 size paper so may not be easily printed on<br/>
US size paper...<br/>
<br/>
It says a lot of nice things about Letterboxing and even examines the<br/>
risks of damage to our heritage..so it is quite worth the reading imho...<br/>
<br/>
(What am I saying ?  Can a govt dept have got something correct ? <ironic<br>
grin&gt;  I think it may be so...!!!)<br/>

Re the last message about UK Parks Authority views on Letterboxing and<br/>

<br/>
I didn't say these things but...<br/>
<br/>
To read the pdf file you will need the Adobe Acrobat reader (free download<br/>
from their site)<br/>
<br/>
and (I must say) that using my slow (steam driven) modem it did take a<br/>
longinsh time to download...<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd add those points..<br/>

It is worth trying though..imho<br/>

The park service apparently considers placing any object in a <br/>
national park to be a violation of law.  A search of the NPS website <br/>
turned up 2 references in an internal newsletter that may give an <br/>
idea of their mindset.<br/>

OPERATIONAL NOTES<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Geocaching - There is a new web-based activity called geocaching that <br/>
has affected several National Park Service areas. The Ranger <br/>
Activities Division asked Olympic NP SA Mike Butler to investigate.  <br/>
Here's his report: Geocaching is an activity in which participants <br/>
hide a cache and take a position at the location using a GPS <br/>
receiver.  The position is then published on the group's web site <br/>
with an invitation to search for the "treasure." Caches often contain <br/>
a notebook or log book and something the finder may take. The finder <br/>
is asked to put another item in the cache for others to discover and <br/>
will often report the find on the web site. Several caches have been <br/>
found in National Park Service areas. The webmaster for the site <br/>
(www.geocaching.com) has been contacted. He was very surprised that <br/>
geocaching is illegal in NPS areas, and understood NPS concerns about <br/>
the damage geocaching has and can cause to historic, archeological <br/>
and natural sites. He agreed to work with the Service to discourage <br/>
further geocaching activities in parks. Two related activities were <br/>
also discovered. Letterboxing (www.letterboxing.org) is a phenomenon <br/>
similar to geocaching in that a player takes directions from a web <br/>
site and uses those directions to find a hidden object. In <br/>
letterboxing, the directions come in the form of a riddle and the <br/>
hidden object is a stamp which the finder can use to stamp a piece of <br/>
paper to prove that he has visited the site. The web site showed the <br/>
location of at least two letterboxes in parks. The parks have been <br/>
notified, but the Service has not yet contacted the webmaster or game <br/>
managers. The Degree Confluence Project (www.confluence.org) is <br/>
another web-based activity where people try to visit various latitude <br/>
and longitude integer degree intersections and report their findings <br/>
on the web site. In this case, however, no objects are placed in the <br/>
ground, and there are no apparent regulatory violations in areas <br/>
where cross-country travel is allowed or where the confluence is not <br/>
on a protected site. There has been no attempt to contact the project <br/>
organizers. [Mike Butler, SA, OLYM]<br/>

INCIDENTS<br/>

<br/>
02-056 - Lake Roosevelt NRA (WA) - Geocaching Incident<br/>
<br/>
Rangers recently conducted an investigation into geocaching in the <br/>
park.  Geocaching is a sport in which individuals or organizations <br/>
cache materials at particular locations, then provide the GPS <br/>
coordinates via the Internet so that other people can attempt to find <br/>
them. Some times caching entails digging, which presents obvious <br/>
problems in national parks. On February 27th, Patrick Hall asked <br/>
permission to bury a geocache within the park's historic Fort Spokane <br/>
Unit. During the conversation, Hall made several statements which <br/>
revealed that he'd previously been investigated by the US Fish and <br/>
Wildlife Service for this same activity, and that other geocaches<br/>
might already be buried within the park. Ranger Jaime Green <br/>
investigated and found that two caches had already been buried near <br/>
Fort Spokane by a geocache player known as "Fuzzybear." Additional <br/>
investigation uncovered a connection between "Fuzzybear" and Hall. <br/>
Hall was interviewed and admitted placing both caches. Parks <br/>
concerned about this activity within their boundaries may go to <br/>
http://www.geocaching.com and search for caches located in their <br/>
areas. [Chris Rugel, DR, Fort Spokane District, LARO, 3/8]<br/>

<br/>
Yesterday, while stamping in to the Cardinal's Rule<br/>
box in York River State Park, VA we noticed that the<br/>
park manager had left a note in the log saying that he<br/>
found out about 'our game' online and for now would<br/>
let it stand but that we all need to be aware of our<br/>
impact on the habitat and if he saw that impact he<br/>
would remove all boxes (and, I assume, let all other<br/>
state park managers know). <br/>
<br/>
 I think that he has a point, as one could clearly see<br/>
a path worn to the letterbox, so some damage had<br/>
obviously occured to that part of 'the habitat'.  As I<br/>
find more boxes I'm wondering if we need to be more<br/>
aware of the habitat and perhaps place them closer to<br/>
the trail?<br/>

<div>A.D.   Thanks for the update on York 
River SP. I had heard the park manager had paid us a visit. Your indication that 
there has already been some impact on the area makes me realize that box my be 
off the path a bit to far. After 2 years of the hobby I am trying more and more 
to keep the box placed as close to an establish trail as possible. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Last fall, pre 9/11, I made contact with out local 
NP, Prince William Forest. They had agree to host a letterbox series within the 
park, similar to their Orienteering course. It will be a volunteer (me) 
administrated project and should not place any additional work on there already 
limited resources. The clues would be in a written form available in the parks 
visitor center. The corporation on the placement would limit impact and the 
clues at the visitor center would allow them to track volume. Now that spring 
has arrived in VA, I am going to pick up where I left off last Sept and try and 
get that series place. I will try and keep the list updated on the 
progress.</div>

&gt;As I<br/>
&gt;find more boxes I'm wondering if we need to be more<br/>
&gt;aware of the habitat and perhaps place [boxes] closer to<br/>
&gt;the trail?<br/>
<br/>
Don Wilson, the pioneering geocacher here in the Gallatin Valley of Montana, has moved at least one cache because he began to see impact. I certainly think that's a good idea that should be applied to letterboxing as well. (Not all geocachers are irresponsible, by a long stretch!)<br/>
<br/>
I've placed all my letterboxes (but one) either where they can be reached without leaving an established trail or an existing side path, or in bouldery areas just off-trail where there's no vegetation to disturb. ...My wife the microbiologist would dispute this, of course, and she's probably right. Certainly in deserts the absence of visible higher plants does NOT indicate the ("cryptogamic") soil is biologically sterile or that it won't be damaged by foot traffic. <br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how I knew I should avoid disturbable areas -- probably something I read on this list three years ago! -- but I think my choice of very rocky locations was instrumental in my obtaining local US Forest Service permission to place the boxes in the first place.<br/>

I was wondering if that was a possibility that could<br/>
be undertaken in the parks.  I think your idea is<br/>
terrific and can't wait to visit!  <br/>
<br/>
I think that park rangers need to realize that just<br/>
the mere fact that there are trails means there is an<br/>
impact on the habitat...in other words, letterboxers<br/>
aren't criminal and actually bring out many people(and<br/>
some revenue) to parks they may have never had the<br/>
urge to visit before.  I'll be honest and tell you<br/>
that I would have never gone to York River if not for<br/>
the boxes!<br/>
<br/>
I hope your new series will open doors and take the<br/>
'criminal' label off this great hobby!<br/>
&gt; Last fall, pre 9/11, I made contact with out local<br/>
&gt; NP, Prince William Forest. They had agree to host a<br/>
&gt; letterbox series within the park, similar to their<br/>
&gt; Orienteering course. It will be a volunteer (me)<br/>
&gt; administrated project and should not place any<br/>
&gt; additional work on there already limited resources.<br/>
&gt; The clues would be in a written form available in<br/>
&gt; the parks visitor center. The corporation on the<br/>
&gt; placement would limit impact and the clues at the<br/>
&gt; visitor center would allow them to track volume. Now<br/>
&gt; that spring has arrived in VA, I am going to pick up<br/>
&gt; where I left off last Sept and try and get that<br/>
&gt; series place. I will try and keep the list updated<br/>
&gt; on the progress.<br/>
