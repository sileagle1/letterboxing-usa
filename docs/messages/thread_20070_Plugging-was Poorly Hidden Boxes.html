                    <div class="plaintext-content">Also, plugging can be done on rock, but not rocky soil. For example,<br/>
there is a huge mountain of granite here in GA called Stone Mountain.<br/>
On the surface of the mountain is holes and crevices that formed when<br/>
the granite cooled waaaaay back in the day. A letterbox can be shoved<br/>
into one of these holes and then plugged with a rock on top. I had<br/>
never heard the term plugging until I found a box on the mountain that<br/>
some Dartmoor folks had planted (the Squeeeezeboxers) and they<br/>
specifically referred to the box as "Box plugged under a flat topped<br/>
granite slab, amongst trees."<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just wanted to add that.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Please tell us, what the heck <br/>
&gt; &gt; is "plugging", a technique of hiding used in Dartmore? Just curious.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, due to the type of landscape, soil, etc - the environment in<br/>
that area <br/>
&gt; (Dartmoor) is much more condusive to this type of letterbox<br/>
placement. It <br/>
&gt; essentially means that a small hole is dug and the box is inserted<br/>
and covered - <br/>
&gt; either with sod or grass, turf or surrounding material. It is mostly<br/>
heath so that it <br/>
&gt; works quite well.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Guess I should read all posts before posting.  This approach to <br/>
planting under rocks is not the same as digging holes in the sod, <br/>
which I admonished in my prior post.  Refering to the same booklet by <br/>
Janet Palmer, there are lots of 'rock streams' which in Dartmoor are <br/>
referred to as "clitter" (rock litter?) caused by disintegration of <br/>
the granite.   Apparently hard on the ankles for walking, they are <br/>
frequently home to letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
And I'll go ahead an "plug" the booklet : Let's Go Letterboxing  A <br/>
Beginner's Guide, 1998 &amp; 2001, Janet Palmer  A fellow boxer in <br/>
Dartmoor sent it to me and I fould it to be delightful reading.  Some <br/>
of the stamp images shown reflect a high level of humor -- much like <br/>
I see here the yahoo groups. Unfortunately I didn't find a web site <br/>
for ordering a copy, so you're on your own.<br/>

<br/>
I have links to all the Dartmoor books and maps here:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/links/?id=88<br/>
<br/>
You can order them from Amazon.co.uk and they will ship to the US. They're <br/>
all published by small publishers, so they're frequently out of stock or <br/>
take weeks to get, but I have copies of many of them and they're <br/>
interesting reading. The Anne Swinscow books are the most commonly recommended.<br/>
