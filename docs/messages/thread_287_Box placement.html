&gt;  ... there are probably 20 - 30 good spots near where you<br/>
&gt;  are.  I have planted one so far away that it is a chore to go check on<br/>
&gt;  it.  Think of someplace you can get to in less than an hour &amp; without<br/>
&gt;  requiring offroad or climbing equipment (I pretty much messed up on all<br/>
&gt;  3 of those hints for my first box).  The duelling boxes Mitch and I have<br/>
&gt;  placed near home have been much more fun &amp; I check them every once in<br/>
&gt;  awhile when I walk the dog... but it can be as much fun to look in a<br/>
&gt;  local park as out on some distant vista that took 4 days of planning and<br/>
&gt;  3 of driving to accomplish.<br/>
<br/>
I've alwys thought that with the "manifest destiny" mind-set we have<br/>
with<br/>
U.S. letterboxing, that we should be open to putting letterboxes<br/>
wherever<br/>
we feel like it, as long as it is respectful of property and nature and<br/>
as<br/>
long as we consider the safety of the letterbox searcher.  There's no<br/>
reason that a letterbox can't be placed at the end of one's driveway!<br/>
<br/>
Keep the ideas flowing...<br/>
