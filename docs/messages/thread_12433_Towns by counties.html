&gt; figuring out what county to put stuff in! <br/>
<br/>
Yeah! And "county" means different things in different states. It's <br/>
just the way we arbitrarily decided to break things down, but <br/>
hopefully someday we'll be adding GIS capability to the new website, <br/>
and then the counties will be a great resource. (GIS is an <br/>
automapping program that will help folks plan out a day of <br/>
letterboxing).<br/>
<br/>
When I'm trying to sort out counties while web-hosting, I often use <br/>
www.askjeeves.com, and search on "towns by county." I've never found <br/>
a website that does the whole country, but every state I've looked <br/>
for was linked in there, so you can look up which danged county you <br/>
were in last week. Maybe a google search would give a better <br/>
resource? We could all use one now that we're adding our own <br/>
letterboxes. If someone can find a good "town by county" website, <br/>
we'll include a link on the new site.<br/>

&gt; I've never found a website that does the whole country<br/>
<br/>
GNIS knows how to do everything geographical (in the US), if you know <br/>
how to use it (and those handy with perl can write scripts to query it)<br/>
<br/>
http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnis/web_query.gnis_web_query_form<br/>
<br/>
For this application, find the feature where the box is (for town,<br/>
use the choice "populated place", but most boxes are near more<br/>
distinct features ;-)), and the county will pop up (note, I have<br/>
not tried this for locations that are not counties, i.e., Alaska,<br/>
Louisiana, Baltimore, Carson City, and certain places in Virginia<br/>
and elsewhere, but I imagine it does the right thing).<br/>
<br/>
If the "populated place" name is common, you may have to enter the<br/>
state, or even more info.<br/>

Under State QuickFacts, you can find state maps with every county labeled.<br/>
I had type every one of those in for the database.  Geesh.<br/>

OK, not really.<br/>

One resource that might be useful is the Regional portion of the Open<br/>
Directory Project (ODP):<br/>
http://www.dmoz.org/Regional/North_America/United_States/<br/>
Mirror site: http://ch.dmoz.org/Regional/North_America/United_States/<br/>
Most of the states have their towns and cities (known as "Localities")<br/>
crosslinked by_County and by_Region. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps. :-)<br/>
