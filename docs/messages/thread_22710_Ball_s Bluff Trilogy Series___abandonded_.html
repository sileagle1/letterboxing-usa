I am interested in finding out if "The Apple Dumpling Gang"..is still <br/>
known to be active?.. I have emailed them a few times about their <br/>
series: "Ball's Bluff Trilogy" located in Ball's Bluff, in Leesburg, <br/>
Virginia...I have not heard back from them, and their log book for the <br/>
3 stamps in the series were full, and boxers were forced to stuffed <br/>
papers in the box to record their stamps....I'd like to adopt these, <br/>
and maintain them...but was wonder what you guys know about their <br/>
activity..I have heard they are MIA<br/>
<br/>
thx,<br/>

I think replacing a logbook could certainly be accomplished without <br/>
going through the process of switching ownership via adoption of the <br/>
letterbox. Hopefully any finder of our letterboxes would do a little <br/>
bit of maintenance without trying to set up adoption. How do you know <br/>
this box is abandoned? Maybe the placer is on vacation. If you are <br/>
looking to adopt a letterbox why not check out the basement an adopt <br/>
one. Those letterboxes have been orphans for some time.<br/>

Not sure if ya understand...the log books have been full for well <br/>
over a year, i think more like 20 months....these boxes are pretty <br/>
popular, as the park they are in is worth the trip..there is more <br/>
loose paper in the box, than paper in the log books<br/>
<br/>
I have emailed the "Apple Dumpling Gang" 2 times about this series, <br/>
as well as their series in Claude Moore Park (all 4 missing)...and <br/>
have not heard from them in 2 months about it.....<br/>
<br/>
If ya get in touch with them, let me know..if not..Im game to adopt <br/>
this series mentioned, and others they might have left behind<br/>
<br/>
thanks IVY..and BTW....headed to the caves soon i hope!<br/>
