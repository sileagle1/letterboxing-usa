Yep you're going to be hooked. =-) My sister got me hooked last <br/>
summer/fall, and I do love it.  Even when you go out to find a box <br/>
and perhaps it's not there or you can't quite get the clues figured <br/>
out, don't give up because there are plenty mroe out there or you <br/>
will eventually figure out the clues.  Plus you'll get to meet great <br/>
people along the way.  Be creative and learn from others, because <br/>
there's so much to learn, and it's so fun.  Some people create these <br/>
awesome elaborate boxes while others like myself are very basic.  I <br/>
love finding them all and getting different ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!!  See you on the trail and Welcome to the adventure of <br/>
letterboxing!!<br/>
