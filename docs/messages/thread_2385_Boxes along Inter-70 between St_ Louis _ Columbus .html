                    <div class="plaintext-content">HI,  We are planning a road trip to Ohio next week for my niece's graduation. <br/>
 The plan is to take a few boxes along to plant but we are hoping to find <br/>
some too.  The area looks pretty sparse.  Does anyone know if there are boxes <br/>
along Inter-70 that haven't been posted?  Are does anyone plan on posting a <br/>
few before we head out there on May 31st?   I know there are some out in <br/>
Indiana because we bumped into one family of Indiana letterboxers here in IL.<br/>
<br/>
Would love to hear from you if you know of a box that fits the bill.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Mohmers &amp; Kids<br/>
