Nature played on us Sunday night after letting us think it had <br/>
arrived), and the sweetness of recent successes urging us on, <br/>
droll "Team Frick n Frack" are anxious to get on to some more boxing <br/>
adventures! We want to look for the boxes in Onondaga Co (Salt Block <br/>
56 and Carpenters Brook)next weekend but read they were pulled for <br/>
the winter. Just in case my off list email wasn't received I'm <br/>
posting this for St George. Would you give me a heads up on their <br/>
placement back in the field? <br/>
