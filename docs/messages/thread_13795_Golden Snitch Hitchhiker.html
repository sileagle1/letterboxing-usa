  I don't suppose this is was released in VA was it? We are huge Harry<br/>
Potter fans and spent Friday night up all night waiting on the new book's<br/>
release. We are new to letterboxing and made our very first excursion Monday<br/>
afternoon. We found Kermit's Cousin, with little trouble and we were so<br/>
excited, we decided to hunt another. We attempted Little Creek's Seahorse,<br/>
but couldn't find it either due to our inexperience, or someone moved the<br/>
tree that it describes. Do I now email the placer of that box to let them<br/>
know, or go back again later and attempt to find it without the help of four<br/>
kids under 14? Thanks so much for this informative group,<br/>

OK Is HP lucky or what ?... to be getting off for using a "Patronus" in a<br/>

We stayed up all night too on Friday. First to get the book and then my son sat up reading for most of the night. Back up three hours later to start again! Yikes! I can't start until he's done. I've tried picking it up in between his reading time but he gets so possessive! :)<br/>
