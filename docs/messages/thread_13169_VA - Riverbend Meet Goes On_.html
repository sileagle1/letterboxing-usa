time, makes it simple (though abbreviated hours).  <br/>
<br/>
We can recommend to any who ask, nearby letterboxes that would not be <br/>
too muddy for those that want to go after the meet.  <br/>
<br/>
Certainly the real purpose to meet is to "Meet".  See each other and <br/>
exchange, not necessarily to go letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
There is also an Irish Pub in Great Falls if it rains.<br/>

&gt; Okay - how about I call and reserve the Riverbend Pavilion and <br/>
let's meet <br/>
&gt; there anyway?  Their pavilion is a few yards down a trail off the <br/>
parking lot <br/>
&gt; near the visitor's center.  It's large and has a big grill with <br/>
several tables.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've been to Burke Lake Park and seen many nice picnic areas but <br/>
not a <br/>
&gt; pavilion - where is it?<br/>

Woo-hoo!  Sounds good to me - 10am at the pavilion near the visitor's center <br/>
at Riverbend?  Park in the parking lot above the visitor's center and go down <br/>
the trail at the end of the parking lot to the pavilion.  Okay, all?  Gaabriel<br/>
