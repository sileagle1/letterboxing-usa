<br/>
I'm going to add my two cents, because it's timely... as I'll explain<br/>
in a moment.  I agree with the concept of this list not becoming a<br/>
huge chatroom-via-email, because it would be horrendously<br/>
time-consuming to read.<br/>
<br/>
I also agree that, if all I wanted were "just the facts," I'd go to the website.<br/>
<br/>
I feel a personal connection with people whose stamps I've found,<br/>
people I've met at gatherings or as I've traveled, or who've left<br/>
notes in my own letterboxes.  I want to know what's going on in their<br/>
lives, especially if they go quiet for an extended time.<br/>
<br/>
And, at the other extreme--and the reason why this is timely--I went<br/>
through the divorce from Hades and was totally quiet about it--didn't<br/>
even let people know that I was going entirely "no mail"... which<br/>
ended up being over two years.  (At the time, I thought I'd pull<br/>
myself together within a month or two, and there was no reason to say<br/>
much.)<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in the middle is a happy medium.  I don't know what that is,<br/>
and I actually feel that an extended discussion of this can--for some<br/>
readers, especially on Digest--burden the list even more than the<br/>
initial post seemed to.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, I've been reading the list for the past few months as a<br/>
lurker, and I'm slowly getting back to letterboxing again.  I've moved<br/>
from NH to TX, and I'm still not 100% back to my usual activity level,<br/>
but I am planning to resume letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm wondering if anyone has seen either of my letterboxes at<br/>
Gilson Rd, Nashua, NH lately, or the Briget Bishop one in Salem, MA. <br/>
(I know that the Seacoast ones vanished awhile ago.) And, I don't know<br/>
if all of the Fort Worden ones (near Seattle, WA) have gone missing<br/>
now, as well.<br/>
<br/>
I have updated my own pages with the last reports that I had, but if<br/>
my pages still don't reflect what's actually going on, I am too far<br/>
away from the boxes to know about it. <br/>

For "chatty" topics that aren't directly related to letterboxing itself, why<br/>
not just put OT in the subject line of such posts?  Then whoever has time to<br/>
read it can read it, and those who don't have time can bypass the post.  And<br/>
nobody gets their feelings hurt when it seems like people don't care about<br/>
them.  People that don't care can bypass.<br/>
