Hello- Newbie here. I just discovered letterboxing a few days ago. I <br/>
had heard the term before but wasn't quite sure what it was. Now that <br/>
I know I am quite excited to get started. I think this will be a <br/>
really fun activity for my whole family, ecspecially since it is <br/>
something that we can take with us on vacations to give us something <br/>
to do that is not touristy. I think the kids will love it because it <br/>
is kind of like a treasure hunt. I'm thinking that I should get them <br/>
each their own journal to stamp in and then have a family one also. <br/>
Does anyone who does this with thier kids have any suggestions on <br/>
this point? Well I'm excitied to have found this group and look <br/>
forward to discussing it with all of you.<br/>

I have a 9 year old and a 5 year old.<br/>
<br/>
Both of my kids have their own journal and stamp, however, very often <br/>
this makes the stamping in kind of burdensome.  Because my kids are <br/>
older our rule is that if they aren't interested in the actually <br/>
logging in we don't do it for them.  They do it themselves is they <br/>
want to.  They do both enjoy looking back at their logbook.<br/>
<br/>
My brother's family, and many others, have a family stamp and <br/>
logbook.  You might want to try this at first until you get the hang <br/>
of it and see how interested the kids are.  Just a suggestion.  It <br/>
probably depends on how old your kids are.<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to let you know that there is a group especially for <br/>
newbies and they are very helpful and willing to answer ANY questions <br/>
you have, no matter how many times they've been asked.<br/>

<br/>
Hello!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to Letterboxing!  One thing you might want to think about is <br/>
timing.  If you have to stamp the letterbox stamp into a whole bunch <br/>
of journals and then have each person stamp the letterbox journal, it <br/>
might take a while.  Some people who have family teams have one <br/>
family stamp and journal.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the longer you are at a letterbox site, the more likely it is <br/>
that someone else will come down the trail and wonder what the group <br/>
of people are doing!<br/>
<br/>
What state are you from?  There are some localized talk lists that <br/>
might have some more info about letterboxing in your area!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun,<br/>
Amy &amp; Jay <br/>
