website? Thanks!   This is a pair of microboxes located at the <br/>
Chillicothe campus of Ohio University. For several years, the local <br/>
Quilter's Guild has held a quilt show at the campus. This was the <br/>
inspiration for these letterboxes. Placed by Salamander on 9-28-02. <br/>
Difficulty: Easy. Ross County,Ohio.   CLUES: Begin at the campus <br/>
library. At the rear of the building, find a set of steps. Go down <br/>
the steps and proceed down the sidewalk in an easterly direction. Go <br/>
all the way to the end of the sidewalk to the point where it makes an <br/>
abrupt right turn. At this point, take a reading of 350 degrees and <br/>
go 11 paces to the edge of the woods(1 pace=2 steps).     Continuing  <br/>
in the same direction,take 16 paces into the woods. You should see a <br/>
Y-shaped fallen tree trunk spanning a small gulley. The southernmost <br/>
fork of this tree splits into another "Y". This is the place you are <br/>
interested in. To find the second box, walk or drive to the upper <br/>
parking area near the gymnasium. From some parts of this parking lot, <br/>
you will be able to see a bright yellow tornado warning siren atop a <br/>
utility pole. Go to this pole. From here take a bearing of 315 <br/>
degrees and walk 75 paces. Check out the base of the cottonwood tree, <br/>
here you might find a quilting bee!!<br/>
