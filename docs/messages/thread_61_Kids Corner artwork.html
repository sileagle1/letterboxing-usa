&gt; Mitch, everything you're doing looks really <br/>
&gt; good.  Whether we get permission for<br/>
&gt;  Pooh or not I think this is going really well <br/>
&gt; and will turn into a fun way to<br/>
&gt;  spend some time this fall and winter.  <br/>
&gt; The examples of foot cusion stamps are<br/>
&gt;  really neat.  They're cheap, its ordinary stuff <br/>
&gt; you need to make 'em -- mom or<br/>
&gt;  dad probably wouldn't mind picking up the items.  <br/>
&gt;  I like it.<br/>
&gt;  Let me know what help you would like -- putting the pages up, <br/>
&gt;  linking or whatever -- just let me know.<br/>
<br/>

Thanks for your encouragement.  (The same to everybody else who responded.)<br/>
In light of all the controversy we have discovered to exist with the Pooh<br/>
images, I think we should probably start planning on getting by without them.<br/>
It's a shame, because Pooh has that magical British charm that pairs nicely<br/>
with the Dartmoorian roots of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
There have already been offers for assistance in creating our own artwork<br/>
within the group, and some feedback regarding characters (I agree with the<br/>
suggestion that our narrative needs a boy AND A GIRL in the letterbox search<br/>
party).<br/>
<br/>
As far as content, I think the most important graphics we will require are:<br/>
<br/>
1) A picture of our yet-to-be-named search party reviewing a clue map (similar<br/>
in spirit to the picture that is currently on the Kids Corner page)<br/>
<br/>
2) A nice map with clickable features around which we can base our cyber-<br/>
search.<br/>
<br/>
3) A picture depicting the discovery of the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
4) Optionally, a picture of the search party actually in the act of looking<br/>
for the box.<br/>
<br/>
Let's hope for more great input from the group to help flesh out the identity<br/>
of our characters.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was Tom Cooch who pointed out that the 'online letterbox search' is<br/>
not the same as the 'cyber-boxing' issue we all got up in arms about some time<br/>
ago.  This  would be nothing more than a practical, 'learn-by-example' lesson<br/>
for kids who want to know what letterboxing is, and how its done.  We're not<br/>
suggesting that we should all start creating online adventures, instead of<br/>
hiding real boxes.  This project could be a fun, interesting, self-contained<br/>
activity that kids can learn from.  The cyber-box issue had to do with a<br/>
suggestion that we start a precedent for planting letterboxes in the real<br/>
world in which the disappointed discoverer finds no rubber stamp, but only an<br/>
internet address from which to print the stamp image.  That idea went over<br/>
like a cast iron dirigible filled with concrete.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you liked the adhesive foam pad stamp idea.  It works well for the<br/>
youngest letterboxers.  The biggest hassle is peeling the plastic 'skin' off<br/>
the pads. The foam that I saw in the craft store is really nice, but it's hard<br/>
to come by.  I noticed that it comes from a company called "All American<br/>
Graphics" in Santa Monica, CA.  I'll do some research and see if I can learn<br/>
more about them.<br/>
