<br/>
A website that addresses a need that is out there.<br/>
<br/>
The majority of talk on the yahoo groups is about which letterboxes <br/>
have been found, which letterboxes are missing, which letterboxes are <br/>
damaged etc etc. <br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't it be great to have a website that tracks the found <br/>
letterboxes. You could <br/>
search for specific letterboxes to see who found them and when. You <br/>
could see which parts of the country were busiest! Connecticut had <br/>
100 boxes found today and California only had 12 boxes found! Each <br/>
person could input the data the way they do on the LBNA site with <br/>
planted letterboxes. <br/>
This would keep track of a person's F-count too! <br/>
You could immediately see that Music Woman has found 850 letterboxes <br/>
and 100 hitchhikers.<br/>
You could search for a specific box and see that it was found on Oct. <br/>
3rd by Silent Doug, his 629th find. Another box was found on Sept. <br/>
31st by Wanda and Pete, their 2014th find. <br/>
<br/>
It would be great!!<br/>
I would definitely use a website like that. You could immediately <br/>
pull up your own placed letterboxes and see that they had had <br/>
visitors! And extras like This day in History and Weather links would <br/>
fit in perfectly. <br/>

<br/>
Also, several folks have options on their personal letterboxing <br/>
websites where you can comment about a box or update the status of a <br/>
box, so there is a limited amount of this type of thing already going <br/>
on out there. <br/>
<br/>
I especially like the idea of being able to track<br/>
where letterboxing is happening. I am sure Connecticut<br/>
gets a lot of action. But it would be neat to see that<br/>
last week there was a gathering in Ohio and the<br/>
letterbox finds spiked there on that day! Or in<br/>
January, Connecticut being blanketed under massive<br/>
snow storms had very few letterboxes found (only 8 on one sad day) and<br/>
California edged ahead of the pack with 182 finds on<br/>
January 12th!<br/>
Stuff like that would be really neat to know!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just thought that for some people who were hoping to "hone their <br/>
computer skills" that the challenge of creating something like <br/>
this...something NEW, would be fun. I wish I had the computer skills <br/>
to put something like this together!<br/>

&gt; be filtered by the owner of the box, and the status icon to ONLY be<br/>
&gt; changed by the owner and no one else.<br/>
<br/>
That's one option for addressing that issue, but the idea Amanda <br/>
presented doesn't have that inherent flaw--she's only suggested a <br/>
list of boxes that people have found, not boxes they've looked for <br/>
but failed to find and might be interested.  A status report that <br/>
only the owner can change only works if the owner sticks around to <br/>
keep it up to date.  Based on the number of orphaned boxes, I'm <br/>
wondering how well it'll work in practice.  The theory is great, <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
On my clues, I always include the last known date I have for when the <br/>
box was found.  What are the chances that a box placed five years ago <br/>
is still there?  I don't know, but if somebody found it last weekend, <br/>
I'd bet the chances are pretty good that it's still there.  Which is <br/>
why I place to place that information in my clue.  (I also include <br/>
the last known status of my box, so it gives the reader an idea of <br/>
how out of date the status might be.)<br/>
<br/>
So the idea Amanda is promoting isn't about tracking the status of <br/>
the box per se, but rather a method where people can record the boxes <br/>
they've found on an online medium.  Instead of posting to the message <br/>
board, "I've found XYZ box!", they click a button on the website <br/>
logging their find and anyone that's interested in the box can do a <br/>
search for it.  Perhaps even allow the owner or creator of the box <br/>
get an auto-generated e-mail letting them know their box was found <br/>
recently.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Re: A new letterboxing website idea!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; People were against the fact that anyone could say "I couldn't find<br/>
&gt; &gt; it, therefore it is missing."  My idea is for 'status reports' to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be filtered by the owner of the box, and the status icon to ONLY be<br/>
&gt; &gt; changed by the owner and no one else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That's one option for addressing that issue, but the idea Amanda<br/>
&gt; presented doesn't have that inherent flaw--she's only suggested a<br/>
&gt; list of boxes that people have found, not boxes they've looked for<br/>
&gt; but failed to find and might be interested.  A status report that<br/>
&gt; only the owner can change only works if the owner sticks around to<br/>
&gt; keep it up to date.  Based on the number of orphaned boxes, I'm<br/>
&gt; wondering how well it'll work in practice.  The theory is great,<br/>
&gt; though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On my clues, I always include the last known date I have for when the<br/>
&gt; box was found.  What are the chances that a box placed five years ago<br/>
&gt; is still there?  I don't know, but if somebody found it last weekend,<br/>
&gt; I'd bet the chances are pretty good that it's still there.  Which is<br/>
&gt; why I place to place that information in my clue.  (I also include<br/>
&gt; the last known status of my box, so it gives the reader an idea of<br/>
&gt; how out of date the status might be.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So the idea Amanda is promoting isn't about tracking the status of<br/>
&gt; the box per se, but rather a method where people can record the boxes<br/>
&gt; they've found on an online medium.  Instead of posting to the message<br/>
&gt; board, "I've found XYZ box!", they click a button on the website<br/>
&gt; logging their find and anyone that's interested in the box can do a<br/>
&gt; search for it.  Perhaps even allow the owner or creator of the box<br/>
&gt; get an auto-generated e-mail letting them know their box was found<br/>
&gt; recently.<br/>

I guess I don't see the difference between this idea and the<br/>
database idea proposed a few months ago that got everyone<br/>
in such an uproar.  So much so that the Newage Letterboxing<br/>
Talklist had to be formed with its own database.<br/>
If I remember correctly, many people not only objected<br/>
to missing box reports, but ANY box reports, found or not,<br/>
in a public forum.<br/>
It seems to me that if all you want to do is keep track of<br/>
found boxes, the database could do that by eliminating the<br/>
status and comment fields and assume all entries are found<br/>
boxes.<br/>
I would love this because a lot of the fun for me in<br/>
letterboxing is hearing that my boxes have been visited<br/>
and like Ryan, I update my own clue pages to reflect last<br/>
known visits.  The best is when I get personal emails from<br/>
visitors, but that does not happen as much as I would like.<br/>

This is a great point! Also people like Music Woman and Wanda &amp; Pete <br/>
who have already found tons of boxes would have to go in and record <br/>
all those boxes found and that would be incredibly tedious!<br/>
<br/>
So of course this is not going to be a totally accurate count of <br/>
someone's F count. (personally, I think all F counts are relative <br/>
anyway. Some people count hitchhikers some people don't --some people <br/>
count boxes exchanged at events, some people don't --some people <br/>
count boxes sent to them to be planted, but made by other people as <br/>
finds --some people don't...It's all relative) <br/>
<br/>
Also, I don't think Mystery Boxes should be included in the <br/>
Where...except for the one's on a State by State level. I found the <br/>
Washington State Mystery Box in Washington State today.  This would <br/>
not give away the location of the box. If a Mystery Box is a mystery <br/>
as to where in the world, then it should not be reflected in a Where <br/>
stuff was found today database. <br/>

<br/>
Not all boxes are listed as clues on the Internet, though.  There's <br/>
no single source for ALL clues and there never will be, and for <br/>
accurate (I use the term loosely, here) PFX counts, you've still got <br/>
to allow people to account for boxes that aren't listed anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
PFX counts are largely on the honor system, but if people start <br/>
making too many untrue claims, eventually it'll come back to haunt <br/>
them.  Someone that starts claiming a hundred finds but strangely <br/>
aren't stamped into many logbooks and have little to show for their <br/>
efforts at gatherings will start having a serious lack of credibility.<br/>
<br/>
I'm all for honest PFX counts, but I don't think you'll be able to <br/>
patrol it successfully.  It boils down to being part of the honor <br/>
system.  It's not perfect, but I don't see much to improve the <br/>
situation.<br/>

The uproar a few months ago was more about how to account for missing <br/>

one, two, or even a dozen people haven't found it doesn't make it <br/>
missing.<br/>
<br/>
Since so satisfactory answer could be made for how to update the <br/>
status of a box, the idea was dropped.<br/>
<br/>
But this idea is, at it's core, nothing more than a virtual logbook--<br/>
which is already alive and well, but scattered among individual <br/>
websites.  Amanda from Seattle has one, Brett has one, someone named <br/>
Jess (don't know who she is) has one.  Brett actually has a list of <br/>
all his finds, placed, exchages, event stamps, and so on.  Very <br/>
thorough, that Brett.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Even this board is a virtual logbook of sorts.  One could go back and <br/>
recreate the boxes found and placed of many active letterboxers.  <br/>
Certainly not as well organized as the personal pages are, though.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If I remember correctly, many people not only objected<br/>
&gt; to missing box reports, but ANY box reports, found or not,<br/>

That's just a losing battle.  Box reports have been happening since <br/>
day one, they're going on today, and will continue until the end of <br/>
time.  May as well try to catch a waterfall with your hands.<br/>

If you click on Database on the left side of the talklist you<br/>
will see a table called Box Status.  This contains the<br/>
infamous list of boxes that people have found or not found.<br/>
Perhaps a new table could be created called Letterbox Logbook<br/>
with just the fields desired (e.g. Box Name, Placer, State, Date <br/>
Found).  Then you could search by Placer or State or Box, etc.<br/>
There are some who would still not like even this much info.<br/>
about their boxes being displayed, but I would welcome it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My two cents:  I am not interested in a database that shows <br/>
when boxes were found and what condition they were in.  If you <br/>
need that much certainty before you set out, why are you <br/>
letterboxing? Secondly, the idea of having to update the status of <br/>
my boxes online is not attractive.  I don't want to spend that much <br/>
of my free time on the computer! <br/>
<br/>
Third, "box missing" reports, in my experience, are often wrong.  I <br/>
just found the Three Sisters Light letterbox in Eastham, MA, this <br/>
weekend, but another letterboxer emailed me that she couldn't <br/>
find it.  It was tricky, to be sure, but it is there.  So what would be <br/>
the point of someone listing it as missing in a database, when it <br/>
is actually there?  Ditto for the This American Life Box in Boston.  <br/>
I just looked at the LBNA database. Someone reported it <br/>
missing on 9/12.  But it's not missing. I actually found it on 9/25.  <br/>
<br/>
Part of the fun and the appeal is the unknown factor--will you find <br/>
it or won't you?  As far as box condition goes, it's always one of <br/>
the same few things: dry and OK; wet; needs a new logbook, etc.  <br/>
Just email the placer and let them know.  Or, carry a supply of <br/>
paper towels and Ziplocs so you can do box maintenance on the <br/>
trail.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be contrary, but I thought I'd put my thoughts out there, in <br/>
case I'm not the only one who finds the idea of a status database <br/>
unappealing.<br/>

This idea has NOTHING to do with the status of a box.  It's a virtual <br/>
logbook so people can say they've found boxes--which is no different <br/>
than people are already doing except puts them all in the same place <br/>
instead of scattered across the web.  Instead of having to be there <br/>
in person to show off your logbook, you can do it online where you <br/>
can show it off to anyone around the entire country.<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to update the status of a box.  You don't have read <br/>
what other people have found.  (Which you DO, at the moment, when <br/>
they post finds on the talk list.)  Please understand, this is not a <br/>
rehashing of how to determine the status of a letterbox--it's a <br/>
completely different concept that doesn't address the box status <br/>
controversy.<br/>
