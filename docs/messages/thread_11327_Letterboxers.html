  Well, Very bad news, East Fork Lake and State park is now Limiting<br/>
Letterboxes and Geocaches.  From the letters and Information I got was that <br/>
they will be collecting them if they do not have a Permit.<br/>
<br/>
   (Guess they are reading this message,  HIYA RANGERS)<br/>
<br/>
I understand to a point of why the park service does this BUT it<br/>
still does not make me happy. when they built East Fork and how they under <br/>
cut people out of their land to build the lake on (In the Name of Flood <br/>
Control) and now that the park has a little money, It's no longer Flood <br/>
Control it's some kind of Wildlife park.<br/>
<br/>
Most lakes built by ACE are flood control lakes (And A-1 Class Jobs, They do <br/>
a great Job at building things) But darn it, I'm a Taxc payer and I hate the <br/>
idea of having to ask someone at a desk for a permit to place something that <br/>
is not hurting anyone.  I do agree with dropping off a note letting them <br/>
know that it's their BUT asking us to fill out a piece of paper for a permit <br/>
then say (Good News, The Permit is free) Bad news, my hard earned tax money <br/>
is paying you to tell me it's free!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I am missing something on that word FREE!    :O)<br/>
<br/>

   Proud to be an American, Where on eatrh could you post a letter<br/>
like this without the worry that the leadership is going to cut your hands <br/>
off,  Humm  America, That where)  lol<br/>
