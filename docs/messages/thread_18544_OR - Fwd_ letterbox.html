Family O Foxes aren't on this list, but asked that I explain the situation <br/>
regarding the Dorris Ranch letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The Girl Scout letterbox was pulled by an education specialist with Dorris <br/>
Ranch who conducted tours for elementary school kids.  When she complained <br/>
about it interfering with her tour, she pulled it and a geocache (ours) that <br/>
was in the same location and left it at the park office.  The Foxes were <br/>
contacted and when they finally talked with a park representative, they were <br/>
told that it was great that the letterbox was there and Dorris Ranch was <br/>
glad to have it and the others they had planted.  (They even wanted to know <br/>
where it needed to go and they would replace it for them!)  The box was <br/>
picked up from the park office and is going through some TLC before being <br/>
replaced.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, the Foxes were also told that the person who pulled the <br/>
"distraction" was informed that if the letter box was that distracting, then <br/>
they should improve their lecture in order to keep the attention of the <br/>
kids...<br/>
<br/>
Gotta love the Springfield parks... : )<br/>

Whoo!<br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear the happy ending... especially since I'm a Girl Scout leader too and<br/>
I figured if I ever got out that way from MD, I'd be wanting to look for them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for filling us all in!<br/>
