Tacoma<br/>
Pierce County<br/>
Washington<br/>
<br/>
Level of difficulty: Level to steep, steep, steep dirt/gravel trail <br/>
(portions are mucky in rainy season).  Clues easy.<br/>
<br/>
Setting:  War Memorial Park under the East side of the Tacoma <br/>
Narrows Bridge.<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Offers an incredible view of the bridge and the Tacoma <br/>
Narrows.  An excellent site for scuba diving &amp; fishing although you <br/>
have to brave the trail down the cliff to get to the water!  <br/>
Galloping Gertie was the 5th largest suspension bridge in the <br/>
world.  Completed on 1 Jul 1940, she spanned 5,939 ft.  During high <br/>
wind storms, she suffered unusual undulations.  During a 42 hour <br/>
wind storm, she ultimately collapsed on 7 Nov 1940 taking with her <br/>
several cars and an unfortunate dog.  Fortunately, no human was <br/>
killed during the disaster.  Her replacement (the current bridge <br/>
whose name is hopefully Sturdy Gertie) was built 10 years later and <br/>
opened officially on 15 Oct 1950 at a cost of $14 million and <br/>
spanning 5,979 ft.   She will soon be joined by a twin bridge which <br/>
will be built on the South side directly over this park with plans <br/>
to complete the new span by 2008!<br/>
<br/>
Facilities: Picnic tables.  Open from dawn-dusk. <br/>
<br/>
Restrictions: Leash and scoop laws in effect for pets. <br/>
<br/>
Length of trek:   mile roundtrip<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Take I-5 to Exit 132 and head West on Hwy 16.  Take the <br/>
Jackson Ave Exit (just before the bridge) and at the intersection, <br/>
go straight.  The park's entrance is down the hill in front of you <br/>
at the base of the bridge.  Park near the War Memorial garden and <br/>
picnic tables.<br/>
<br/>
Galloping Gertie Letterbox:  <br/>
<br/>
Facing the War Memorial Park sign, head left to the USS Copahee <br/>
Memorial.  Continue left to the see the bell from the USS Tacoma.  <br/>
Head to Old Glory and salute it.  See the trail at 240?  Continue <br/>
down the trail (through the gap in the fence) down a steep, steep, <br/>
steep hill.  I'm warning you this is steep!  Keep a good handle on <br/>
your young children (you might want to leave them in the car for <br/>
this one)!!!  At the `Y' (to the left, the trail continues down an <br/>
even steeper, switchback-y trail toward the water) go right (approx. <br/>
270 degrees).  See the large fallen tree caught among other trees <br/>
before it slides down the cliff?  From it at 45 degrees is a cluster <br/>
of trees.  Behind it is another cluster of trees.  CAREFULLY, <br/>
CAREFULLY, CAREFULLY walk to this second cluster avoiding the sheer <br/>
cliff on your left or you might suffer the same fate as Galloping <br/>
Gertie did in 1940.  Within this cluster to the back is the twisting <br/>
Galloping Gertie just before she collapsed.  <br/>

Evil Glenn and I visited the new Galloping Gertie Box today.<br/>
Tricky trail, definite hazard! <br/>
You too could go the way of 'Ol Gert.<br/>
<br/>
Found the UFO HH hiding there, must have missed his planet's perigee.<br/>
We have it in our transporter buffer for safe keeping.<br/>
<br/>
Trial n Error<br/>
