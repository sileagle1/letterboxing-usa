<br/>
Take Rte 6 in N.Windham past Walmart and the small Windham  airport. <br/>
Not long after the shopping district there is a commuter parking lot <br/>
on the left. Pull in and park here. <br/>
<br/>
Two otters came out to play <br/>
On  a sunny winter day. <br/>
<br/>
We saw them slip and slide on the  ice <br/>
Seeing this is exciting and nice. <br/>
<br/>
We made a box and put it here <br/>
Vandals  smashed it that was clear. <br/>
<br/>
Same log and stamp recovered now <br/>
Have a new home for good now. <br/>
<br/>
Pass through the gate <br/>
 on any date <br/>
<br/>
Turn right <br/>
the path in sight <br/>
<br/>
Follow white lines <br/>
through white  pines <br/>
<br/>
Down  a gentle slope <br/>
Even a  set of wheels could cope <br/>
<br/>
We passed some logs on the right <br/>
In  a stack  packed tight <br/>
<br/>
We come to a place where someone lived <br/>
There steps and cellar hole a memory give. <br/>
<br/>
The flood control moved them on <br/>
and so shall you go on <br/>
<br/>
Pass all of their wall <br/>
Continue a little more don't stall <br/>
<br/>
Then on the left  another set of gaurdrails <br/>
This is the end of your trail <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Go to 11 th post and look <br/>
across the street they took<br/>
<br/>
See a stone<br/>
Moss is grown <br/>
up a drive there was <br/>
a home<br/>
<br/>
Look left the steps <br/>
look right a tree<br/>
Big as can be<br/>
<br/>
In the bucket  <br/>
my box with  luck it ( will be) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
( We actually spied otters at play in the winter from the dike where <br/>
you began  take a moment to look for the  wildlife this park is <br/>
abundent in .  You may collect Paddle to the Sea letterbox  by going <br/>
from the same starting point.) <br/>
<br/>
See also the Paddle to the Sea Letterbox, which is nearby.<br/>
