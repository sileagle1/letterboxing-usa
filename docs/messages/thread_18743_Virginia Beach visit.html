                    <div class="plaintext-content">My family and I traveled from So. California to Virginia last week, and <br/>
we found the Old Maid and Fort Story Lighthouse boxes in Virginia <br/>
Beach. Many thanks to Lone Pony and Ladybug for guiding us to two <br/>
delightful spots we would not have known to visit otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Finding the Old Maid was a bit of a challenge, because the bench <br/>
referenced in the clues has apparently been removed. But with some <br/>
searching around the area, we eventually located the fallen tree, and <br/>
success was ours!<br/>
<br/>
My older son (teenager) and husband had, prior to last weekend, been <br/>
making jokes about my newfound letterboxing hobby. But guess who took <br/>
up the hunt for Old Maid with as much determination as I did? They're <br/>
hooked now, so the joke's on them.<br/>
<br/>
We're still chuckling about the chutzpah of Ladybug, posting a <br/>
letterbox on an active military base! Is that a unique distinction to <br/>
this box?<br/>
<br/>
I'm only sorry that time restraints prevented us from seeking more of <br/>
the VA boxes--maybe next trip!<br/>

<br/>
We have had a similar situation with our 20 year old son. <br/>
<br/>
In 2 weeks we leave from CT to Atlantic Beach, NC and our hope is to hit at least 1 letterbox in every state along the way. He rolled his eyes when we told him this, but guess who's helping to solve some of the mystery boxes we hope to hit on the way - you guessed it - that "uninterested" 20 year old.<br/>
<br/>
This really demonstrates the appeal of this hobby if it can reach a teenager and a 20 year old!<br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear you and yours have gotten bitten by the letterboxing bug. It's a difficult bite to heal!!! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
<br/>
