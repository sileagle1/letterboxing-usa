<div>Rated: Medium a 2 hour walk mostly down 
hill.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Planted: Feb. 19,2001 Presidents 
Day</div>

<div>By: Cock-A-Doodle-Moo 4-H Club</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The 4-H Clover Box had its first adventure at the Winter 
Gathering  and has many wonderful stamps from that outing. Now it has a 
permanent home here on Mansfields Nipmuck.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This makes this piece of Nipmuck trail a 
threesome as follows:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Folow clues to Wolf Rock box as 
posted</div>
<div>After   that box ,continue down the 
trail</div>
<div> along a well travelled and clear path the 
walk takes you down hill to Sawmill Brook. Here trip along the stone crossing 
carefully . After the brook look for an Arrow denoting the turn in the trail, 
face this arrow and take a compass reading of 260  drgrees. the gnarled 
twisted cyclops guards the  4-H Clover box you seek. </div>
<div>   If you would like to pursue Fuzzy 
Wuzzy follow the trail down through and across the power line. Enter the woods 
cross a couple of wet areas then when you come to a large stone chair on the 
right backtrack with the posted Fuzzy Wuzzy clues from that point.  After 
the gather of the  third box  turn around and the trail takes you all 
the way down to Puddin La. A car can be left at the big rock there to ferry you 
back to Crane Hill and the Wolf Rock parking area. </div>
<div>   If a one car adventure, do  
the first two boxes and turn back, drive to Puddin La. and hike up to Fuzzy 
Wuzzy.</div></body></html>
