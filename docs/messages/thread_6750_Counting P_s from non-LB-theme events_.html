                    <html><body>OK.  I've been following the thread about counting P's.  Sounds like I can count them if they are for a letterboxing event.  Now I need some advice on the following scenario:<br/>
I am on the planning committee for my stamp club's 2nd annual stamp camp weekend.  Last year, we thought it would be fun to introduce stampers and scrappers to the letterboxing experience.  We did a series of 9 boxes, complete with a letterboxing pouch for each stamper.  The pouch contained a journal to stamp in, a pencil, a set of 9 clue tags assembled on a ballchain loop, and a map of the hiking trails.  (Even included change for the soda machine, since the last box in the series was hidden behind the machine!)  Nearly all 50 attendees completed the series, and wanted another adventure for this year.  Our club is busy planning this year's event, which will include another letterbox series (Wizard of Oz theme).<br/>
<br/>
Now my question:  Can I count these as P's, even though the intent of the weekend is a stamping experience, rather than strictly a letterbox gathering?  And, if I can count them as P's, should I stamp the images from each planted box into my permanent letterboxing journal?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your input.<br/>

Yes!   If it was a letterbox and you planted it ... it is a P<br/>
