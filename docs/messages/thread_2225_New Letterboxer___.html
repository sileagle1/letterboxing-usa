     I'm new to this whole thing.  I got turned on to this by a <br/>
family member up in CT.  My first find was this passed weekend and I <br/>
had a lot of fun.  I never knew this sort of thing existed.  I would <br/>
like some info on these patches everyone is talking about.  I am all <br/>
for it.  I have sooooo many trips planned now that I have started.  <br/>
The biggest trip of all would be the "Gathering" in the Mid <br/>
Atlantic.  It sounds like lots of fun.  Thank you all for such a <br/>
wonderful hobby......and hope to hear about these patches <br/>
soon.....Box on All!!!!!!!<br/>

<br/>
As I've already advised Reyna directly by email, the mid-atlantic <br/>
gathering planned for May 19th has been cancelled.  I'd encourage you <br/>
to seek other boxers in your area, as this is an activity which can <br/>
be greatly enjoyed by others with like interests.  Thanks to all who <br/>
expressed interest in the mid-atlantic gathering.  I hope an <br/>
agreeable date/location can be set in the future.<br/>
