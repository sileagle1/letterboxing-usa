Please do not feel that you've disappointed or misled anyone.<br/>
<br/>
There were several ideas about a gathering in IL in May.  Between the <br/>
distance from where I live, the timing (we have a critical on-site visit/review at <br/>
work in May), and other commitments, I would not be able to help with the <br/>
planning of such an event.  Perhaps there are other LBers in the Great Lakes areas <br/>
that might be able to get things off the ground?<br/>
<br/>
As far as carving is concerned, just jump in and give it a try!  I'm not <br/>
artistic by a long stretch, so I use clip art, frequently combining many images <br/>
together into a new look.  Alas, I'll probably never be able to do a free-hand <br/>
drawing.  Dollar store erasers are a good source of carving medium.  They're <br/>
inexpensive for practice carvings.  And, don't forget that you can turn the <br/>
medium over and carve on the other side, too!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, and welcome to LB'ing!<br/>

Probably wouldn't be going to something on Memorial Day weekend.  <br/>
Well, ok ... I take that back.  We wouldn't think of missing it ... <br/>
if it were held near the marina where our boat is. LOL!<br/>
