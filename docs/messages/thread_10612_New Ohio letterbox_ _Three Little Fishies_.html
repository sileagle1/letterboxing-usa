Ohio.Difficulty: Easy. Placed 2-2-03 by Salamander. This letterbox is <br/>
located just off the Chillicothe Pedestrian/Bikeway Corridor. This is <br/>
a popular paved walkway stretching for 3.1 miles along the Scioto <br/>
River. You may access the corridor in many different places, but the <br/>
starting point for this letterbox quest is the parking area at the <br/>
end of Poplar Street. CLUES: Head west along the walkway from the <br/>
parking area access. You will soon come to a "3.0 mile" marker. Stop <br/>
at this marker. Go 17 paces at a heading of 292 degrees. (1 pace= 2 <br/>
steps). You should arrive at a tree with several trunks, one of which <br/>
has been cut down leaving a somewhat rotted stump. The letterbox is <br/>
hidden within the stump, under a couple of rocks and a small chunk of <br/>
concrete.<br/>
