<br/>
Coaches Corner<br/>
My desire as your coach, advisor, friend, professor, and mentor (and <br/>
to some "YODA") is to give you the tools to be successful in shooting <br/>
and in life.  I have found in my life that it is not always about <br/>
winning.  I have striven to be one of the best instructor's in the <br/>
country.  I had goals of being a top competitor.  I had a plan and a <br/>
regiment to get there.  I had plans to raise a wonderful family <br/>
(despite the fact that my kid's didn't come with instructions.)  I <br/>
had plans of finding the girl of my dreams in my wife Patty.  I had a <br/>
dream of opening a family oriented hunting, fishing and dog training <br/>
retail store.<br/>
<br/>
Every dream and goal I faced was challenging and took a huge <br/>
commitment.  I achieved every one of those dreams plus so many more <br/>
that I couldn't list them all here.  <br/>
<br/>
What made me a winner?  Attitude, Commitment, a lot of support from <br/>
loved ones and friends and the grace of God.  I wanted to be rich.  <br/>
It came in presents called Andrea, Jessica, Patty and so many <br/>
friends.  Money isn't the only measure of riches.  I definitely am <br/>
not financially wealthy, but I wouldn't trade my life with anyone.  <br/>
It's been an awesome ride and I have met more wonderful people and <br/>
made more great friends than a person deserves.  It's like getting <br/>
two or three great hunting dogs.  You might get one but to get two or <br/>
three great dogs is surely a special gift.  My friendships are my <br/>
fortune.  My riches are in seeing you turn out as a fine young man or <br/>
woman who takes a little piece of me into the future.  Something that <br/>
will help you enjoy your life and something to use to become <br/>
successful and a winner in life.  Something that you will give to <br/>
your children and grandchildren.  <br/>
<br/>
I now have ALS (Lou Gerhig's Disease).  It wasn't one of my goals nor <br/>
will I beat it as I have done in so many of my challenges.  It will <br/>
beat me and I will lose to the disease. In 1995, I was given 6 months <br/>
to a year to live.  Because I have survived 12 years, does that make <br/>
me a winner?  No, it doesn't.  It makes me blessed by God.  It makes <br/>
me appreciate how precious life is.  It lets me realize that each day <br/>
if I wake; there is one more day I can make a difference in someone's <br/>
life, and that if I can get out of bed that it will be fantastic no <br/>
matter what happens.  I love my "Job".  I look forward to going out <br/>
to Triple B and working with aspiring shooters.  Every day I pray to <br/>
God, thanking Him for blessing me and giving me another day to help <br/>
someone else and set an example for my students and hopefully make a <br/>
difference in their lives.  <br/>
<br/>
I can no longer win a shooting tournament.  It's not about winning. <br/>
It's about playing the game with love and respect.  I need help to <br/>
mount my shotgun and some one has to take it before I drop it after I <br/>
shoot.  I shoot because it is my challenge to myself.  I want to play <br/>
the game in spirit and in style.  I enjoy every minute out on the <br/>
course and at the shoots. I shoot in pain.  I hurt for days <br/>
afterwards.  But I shoot because I enjoy the game. Do I want to win? <br/>
Of course, but again, it's not about winning.<br/>
<br/>
I can't drive a car or swim. I can't run or even lift a ball to throw <br/>
it.  I can hardly feed myself.  I can't get into bed by myself and I <br/>
can't walk to the bathroom.  Is this the image of a winner?  Not in <br/>
Hollywood maybe.  If I can overcome my obstacles so that I can be <br/>
there to teach you how to shoot, than you should be able to overcome <br/>
your problems and give me respect by acting like a champion. You <br/>
say "You're upset because you missed a target".  Give me a break. <br/>
(Just try to put it into perspective).  <br/>
<br/>
I see you kids with "I want it now" attitudes and expectations of <br/>
instant gratification and I ask myself what happened to the fun of <br/>
the game.  I see kid's going to tournaments expecting to win but not <br/>
doing their homework.  I see kids throwing shells, pouting, and <br/>
beating themselves up with no chance of winning because they're there <br/>
for the wrong reasons and not properly prepared. It's not about <br/>
winning and instant gratification.  It's about learning how to play <br/>
the game with style and laughter and determination.  It's about <br/>
the "Fun of the Game".<br/>
<br/>
I ask myself these questions. Am I lucky? Am I a winner? Am I <br/>
successful?<br/>
I am lucky:  To be given time to share with others.<br/>
I am a winner:  Just look at my family and friends.<br/>
I am successful:  Look at my smile.<br/>
<br/>
What more could I want?  <br/>
For you to be at least as successful in life as I have been and more.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want self-pity or any one else's.  You shouldn't either.  You <br/>
are good enough to win the tournaments on your own ability. Are you <br/>
willing to put in the work?  When you feel like whining, Take your <br/>
thoughts off you and think about someone else.  <br/>
<br/>
I chose to start a non-profit youth training program so that you <br/>
could succeed.  Your success is not in winning the tournament; it is <br/>
in winning at life.  Winning the tournament is a test of where you <br/>
are. Winning at life is who you are and who you will become. Do I <br/>
want to be a winner at life? Absolutely.  How do I play the game?  I <br/>
will play with all my heart. I will play with laughter, humility, <br/>
love and respect and by the grace of God.  How will you play?<br/>
<br/>
God Bless you always,<br/>
<br/>
Jim<br/>

&gt; I don't want self-pity or any one else's.  You shouldn't either.  <br/>
You <br/>
&gt; are good enough to win the tournaments on your own ability. Are <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; willing to put in the work?  When you feel like whining, Take your <br/>
&gt; thoughts off you and think about someone else.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I chose to start a non-profit youth training program so that you <br/>
&gt; could succeed.  Your success is not in winning the tournament; it <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; in winning at life.  Winning the tournament is a test of where you <br/>
&gt; are. Winning at life is who you are and who you will become. Do I <br/>
&gt; want to be a winner at life? Absolutely.  How do I play the game?  <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; will play with all my heart. I will play with laughter, humility, <br/>
&gt; love and respect and by the grace of God.  How will you play?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; God Bless you always,<br/>
&gt; <br/>

I see you kids with "I want it now" attitudes and expectations of <br/>

the game. I see kid's going to tournaments expecting to win but not <br/>
doing their homework. I see kids throwing shells, pouting, and <br/>
beating themselves up with no chance of winning because they're there <br/>
for the wrong reasons and not properly prepared. It's not about <br/>
winning and instant gratification. It's about learning how to play <br/>
the game with style and laughter and determination. It's about <br/>
the "Fun of the Game".<br/>
