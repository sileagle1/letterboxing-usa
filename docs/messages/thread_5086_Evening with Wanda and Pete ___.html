Friday evening!!<br/>
Muk-Luk's "Lost and Found" was on the schedule and tho the weather <br/>
threatened we perservered and were rewarded with a great hike!!<br/>
2nd times a charm Muk-Luk!! Spring flowers were simply beautiful....what a <br/>
difference 5 months can make.<br/>
Much better going "up trail" than bushwacking :)<br/>
Company was a real treat!!!<br/>
"The box that finds you", found us, and we were thrilled to be included in <br/>
this rare beautiful experience.<br/>
Wanda picked up "Harriet" at the Floating Feather box along the Deleware <br/>
Canal, were we met, and were she goes from there who is to guess...<br/>
Dinner conversation was inspiring. Had a great time. Thanks to all!!<br/>
(Good people are the crown of being alive...)<br/>
See Joy<br/>
