Several weeks ago my wife and I began 'boxing after reading the <br/>
Washingtonton Post article.<br/>
We discovered two boxes in Michigan near our home.  "The First <br/>
Letterbox on Lake Michigan" and "The Birthday Box" were our finds.<br/>
 We were so excited when we found the boxes that we read the <br/>
notebook, stamped our stamps and quicly re-hid the boxes.<br/>
My question:<br/>
I know that we read a neat little blurb in the boxes about the <br/>
purpose of the boxes and a request that non-letterboxers leave the <br/>
contents intact (and a reference to the LbNA website).....<br/>
Is there some commonly accepted boilerplate language that you suggest <br/>
to fill that need?<br/>
I'm all ready to place my first box (the stamp is DONE!) and want to <br/>
make sure to do it right.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

can look inside, but its not trash, so don't throw it away! This is short enough that you can type it on a <br/>
small piece of paper that is taped to the outside of the box, and fit another copy or two inside with <br/>
the logbook.<br/>

------------------<br/>
Congratulations!<br/>
You have found the secret XYZ Letterbox.<br/>
Please do not disturb or remove this box. [&lt;--This line in BOLD!]<br/>
Instead, leave an impression of your rubber stamp "signature" and any comments you may have <br/>
about your experiences here. <br/>
You can find out more about the sport of letterboxing, as well as clues to hundreds more letterboxes <br/>
hidden throughout the United States at:<br/>
www.letterboxing.org<br/>
After you have finished reading the logbook and leaving your comments, please return this box to its <br/>
hiding place. Be discrete so that you do not reveal the location of the letterbox to any passersby. <br/>
Please return everything to its undisturbed state so that the box will remain well hidden for the next <br/>
visitors. <br/>
