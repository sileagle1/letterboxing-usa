ranging from Maine to Massachusetts to New York to Ohio, I just <br/>
wanted to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has taken the <br/>
time to meet, plan, or provide hospitality for these wonderful events <br/>
and all the earlier one's too! Chris, John, Bob, Marge, Angele, <br/>
Linda, Deanne, Ginger, Deb, Nancy, Ron, Ed, Beth, Randy, Kim, Aili, <br/>
Sue, Joy, Carolyn, and everyone else who has taken part in creating <br/>
these memorable occasions - either by organizing them, creating <br/>
special boxes or stamps, presenting extra activities (like <br/>
the "Selden Charter" and Alafair's "bookbinding" workshop), preparing <br/>
burgers and other terrific food (like great chicken salad, fresh <br/>
fruit, and baklava), or just by giving us all a warm welcome - many <br/>
thanks to you all! You're a great bunch!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Wanda<br/>
