around Pankapoag Pond to seek out the Ponkapoag Turtle Letterbox <br/>
(special thanks to the folks who put it there). If anyone is ever in <br/>
the Milton, MA area I recommend this walk, it's beautiful(the<br/>
stamp <br/>
is too). We especially enjoyed the Boardwalk (located a little ways <br/>
around the pond trail)! The boardwalk stretches into a peatland or <br/>
bog area from the trail to the edge of the pond. Unfortunately we <br/>
couldn't make it all the way out to the end because the last bit<br/>
was water logged (as I was lucky enough to discover), but on the way <br/>
back we spotted some neat pitcher plants. This is definitely a place <br/>
we want to explore at different times of the year to catch all the <br/>
seasonal growth. <br/>

Letterboxing Rocks! <br/>
