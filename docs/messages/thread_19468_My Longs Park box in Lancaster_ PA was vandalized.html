placed at Longs Park, in Lancaster PA was vandalized. I am not going <br/>
to be putting the box backup up due to it being a high traffic area <br/>
and will probably happen again. I am going to be making a hitchhiker <br/>
stamp of this box instead. Did anyone on this forum get a chance to <br/>
find it before it was ruined? If so what did you think? Talk to you <br/>
later.<br/>
