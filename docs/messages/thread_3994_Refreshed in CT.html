                    <div class="plaintext-content">Happy holidays to our wonderful letterboxing friends! We ventured out <br/>
early this morning to replace one of our letterboxes in Mystic CT <br/>
that has gone missing: hope you get a chance to re-visit and collect <br/>
the new stamp. Enjoy!<br/>

-----------<br/>
Captain's Walk<br/>
An easy three mile walk through the historic district of Mystic <br/>
Connecticut, passing the homes of many 19th Century sea captains.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: from I-95 in Mystic, CT, take exit 89 (Allyn Street). <br/>
Turn south toward Mystic and take the first left onto Sandy Hollow <br/>
Rd. Follow the boat launch signs to turn left on High St, right on <br/>
Bindloss Ave, and then left on River Rd. Follow River Rd northward to <br/>
pass under the I-95 bridges and park in the jogger's and stroller's <br/>
area along the river.<br/>
<br/>
Taking foot, backtrack southwards downstream on River Road with the <br/>
water on your left for about  mile to the historic district. Turn <br/>
left on Starr St, which will become Pearl St for a block, and then <br/>
turn left onto Eldridge St. In a short way, turn left on Gravel St <br/>
and follow it almost to the end. Look for a small public park/parking <br/>
area on the left, just opposite the Christian Science Reading Room. <br/>
There are two large railroad-tie planters there on the southwest side <br/>
with zen-shapely cedars. Try the eastern planter closest to the water <br/>
and look in the southwest side just under the cedar for the Captain's <br/>
Walk Letterbox. There are wonderful shore side benches placed just <br/>
for your stamping in ritual.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the return voyage: you could just retrace your steps, but the <br/>
following route is the one recommended by the Mystic Historical <br/>
Society. Carefully cross busy West Main St in the crosswalk and turn <br/>
left (east), enjoying the shops and boutiques. Just as you step onto <br/>
the drawbridge, turn right onto the decked wharf along the river. <br/>
Follow the wharf downstream and pass through the Steamboat Wharf gate <br/>
(public coastal access is protected by law). Follow the wharf a short <br/>
way further to turn right toward a parking lot. Now head west, left <br/>
when facing away from the water towards the parking lot, passing <br/>
behind condos and back to the river. Walk between the river to your <br/>
left and the Mystic Art Association to the right, and then turn right <br/>
with the path. In the parking lot, with ledge straight ahead, turn <br/>
right past the front door of the Art Association and then jog left <br/>
out onto the main street at the little gatehouse. (Our eldest enjoys <br/>
her first job waiting tables across the street at the Voodoo Grill: <br/>
stop in for their white chili if you're hungry!) Turn right, <br/>
northeast, here and walk a block down to the intersection with Rte 1. <br/>
Go left, west, at the crosswalk, and then right to cross over to the <br/>
north side of the road by Mystic Pizza - yes, that Mystic Pizza.<br/>
<br/>
Turn left and walk westerly uphill towards the imposing Union Baptist <br/>
Church. Turn right just before it onto High St and walk several <br/>
scenic northbound blocks. Turn right on Clift St, then left on Clift <br/>
Lane, then right on Starr St and finally left onto River Rd, back to <br/>
the start.<br/>

After some recent correspondence, we've been thinking about our <br/>
Freestone letterbox ("Jay's Dilemma") and decided that it was long <br/>
overdue for a handcut stamp. It turned out great! The only problem is <br/>
finding the danged thing...<br/>

What fantastic clues, stamps, and landscape!<br/>
It's well worth the brain sweat required to find these boxes. It looks<br/>
like they've been a little lonely recently.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Jay for sharing this special spot.<br/>

Cheers,<br/>
