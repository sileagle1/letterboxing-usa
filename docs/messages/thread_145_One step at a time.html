                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you to all of you who responded to the "Clues Options" post.<br/>
Well, I'm a bit overwhelmed.  And I'm also very happy with Adrian's comments. <br/>
Adrian and I have both gone through a difficult divorce at about the same time<br/>
it appears.  You said something interesting in your note Adrian.  You said this<br/>
about your memories: "Its funny how you want to get away from someone but<br/>
afterwards you only remember the good times when the bad times far outwayed the<br/>
good."  I know I did that too.  I just want to confirm for you what I think that<br/>
is.  I think its a good quality.  We wanted to see good memories in all things,<br/>
even the bad times.  Its OK.  We lied to ourselves a bit to try to keep things<br/>
fair. Wouldn't you say that's it?  I think so.  There were good memories and bad<br/>
ones.  But then you reach a point where you have to move on and there's nothing<br/>
to look forward to anymore good or bad, and there's nothing to look back on good<br/>
or bad either because with more distance and more time the memories become<br/>
foggy.  Our division with ILC worked that way for me.  At this point I just use<br/>
the experience to remember what not to do.  I learned a lot from it.  Divisions<br/>
happen and you learn from them.  But its a happy day today because I sense a<br/>
"marriage" (or "birth") of letterboxing projects between Europe and North<br/>
America. So that's what I'd like to focus on from this point forward.<br/>
<br/>
There were supportive comments as to "Clues Options" (the e-mail form) and also<br/>
Adrian's suggestions for expanding our maps to include Canada, England, etc. are<br/>
interesting.  There is a lot to bite off here.  I think we need to take this one<br/>
step at a time.  We can go slowly I think.  We have time to do it.  I don't yet<br/>
have a map source for areas outside of the U.S.  So that's something to look<br/>
into.<br/>
<br/>
But here is what I believe step one should be:  Randy, I hope you will forgive<br/>
me for being direct to the group with this.  Randy has a 400<br/>
megabyte server that he is willing (at some point) to use to house clues.  Its<br/>
also on a slow link right now so it would not be practical to use right now. <br/>
But certainly at some point in the future it would be a Godsend if we are<br/>
needing to house many clues.  So step one I believe is to think about housing<br/>
clues, now on my server through my internet service account, and later through<br/>
Randy's bigger server.  Mine will last for a while so we can just keep it going<br/>
the way it is until it gets close to running out of space and then we can think<br/>
about changing over to the bigger one.  By then we may have a solution to the<br/>
slow link problem.  Thank you Randy very much!<br/>
<br/>
Please don't stop making comments at this point.  Thom, I was very happy to see<br/>
you make such positive comments.  Erik, yours were thorough as ever - lots to<br/>
think about.  Adrian's e-mail notes obviously have some coding for fonts and<br/>
background color.  That's a comment all itself because it fits what is being<br/>
suggested for using an e-mail form to post clues.<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone be willing to propose an e-mail form for clues?  What would that<br/>
look like?  Be simple if you propose something -- simple and easy is the rule!!<br/>
<br/>
Adrian's e-mail message opens me up.  I hope we can do some of the interesting<br/>
things that are being suggested here.  Mitch, I hope you have not put out the<br/>
light on Kids Corner, but still have your creative juices flowing.  Also, thank<br/>
you Mitch for putting Kansas on the map.  I will have to post that one later as<br/>
I'm about to nod off for the night. BTW, I have a friend in Overland Park,<br/>
Kansas.  Is the Kansas letterbox site near Overland Park?<br/>
<br/>
Take care all,<br/>
Dan'l<br/>

No, Dan, these boxes are about 350 miles from Overland Park.  Phillips County<br/>
is in a very remote part of Northwestern Kansas, so anyone who finds these<br/>
boxes deserves a round of applause.  But I couldn't resist the temptation to<br/>
put Kansas on the map.  I'm working on a plan to have a friend of mine in<br/>
Kansas City, Missouri, hide one or two of my boxes for me.  This would put<br/>
Missouri on the map, and would be very convenient for Dan's friend in Overland<br/>
Park, Kansas (a suburb of KC).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Lynn would even travel from Columbia, MO some weekend to look for it??<br/>
<br/>
By the way, Thom, any word from the party that was going to hide your Mt.<br/>
Shasta (California) box for you?  Another of my goals is to get a box set out<br/>
in Washington state sometime soon.<br/>
<br/>
No, Dan, I haven't lost my motivation to finish the Kids Corner.  Just taking<br/>
a break to recover from the holidays and collect my thoughts.  I am open to<br/>
any and all suggestions anyone may have for it.<br/>
<br/>
Considering that most of the country is a deep freeze, we are getting lots of<br/>
encouraging input and everyone seems to be in the right frame of mind to make<br/>
the coming year a phenomenal success for our hobby.<br/>
<br/>
All the ideas for simplifying the clues publishing process sound great.  I'm<br/>
anxious to see how it all turns out.  It was also great to hear such positive<br/>
comments from Adrian.  Our hobby owes a lot to him, and it's nice to know he's<br/>
on board with the things we are doing over here.<br/>
