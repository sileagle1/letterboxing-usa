                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks everyone I have been making a list of everything  that has <br/>
been offered. There have been so many great ideas!  Does everyone <br/>
like the idea of bring your main course , soup will be here, all <br/>
contribute to the dessert table. Yes we have fridge and freezer space <br/>
to use.  As far as weather I guess we play it by ear. I don't want <br/>
anyone to feel they should drive when the weather is bad.  I would <br/>
say we only cancel if the state is going to be or is shut down by <br/>
multi inches.  Remember we hope to do an Aug. function in conjunction <br/>
with our fair (4-H) so if you have to miss one there will be <br/>
another.  I think in terms of the  carving contest we will have such <br/>
odd awards that it will be fair youth or adult. <br/>
   As far as directions I will post them in a few days I want to <br/>
drive up there and get mileage and all.  The fair grounds are in <br/>
Vernon  about 20-30  min. from the Uconn campus.  I wish I could find <br/>
something right here but our library which would have been fine is <br/>
under construction. Another time maybe there.  I'll check in everyday <br/>
for more ideas we will do as much as we can.   Carol<br/>

    Loved the idea of nametags that include your own stamp.  These could be<br/>
of the "make your own" kind set up at a table near the entrance.  We'd just<br/>
need blank sticky tags and a marker or two.  Ann T.<br/>
