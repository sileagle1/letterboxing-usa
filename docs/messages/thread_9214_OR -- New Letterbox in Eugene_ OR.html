placed the Skinner's Butte Letterbox in Eugene, Oregon, in Lane <br/>
County.<br/>
<br/>
After my first three months of Law School, I have finally decided to <br/>
begin populated Eugene with Letterboxes.  This one is placed on the <br/>
top of Skinner's Butte, overlooking the beautiful city of Eugene. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, there is a way to drive up to the top of the butte, but I don't <br/>
know how.  Eugene is a pedestrian town, so I'll tell you how to hike <br/>
up to the top.  If you know how, and want to drive up, you'll save <br/>
yourself 30-45 minutes.  But for us walkers, here's how to get to <br/>
the trail which will take you to the top:<br/>
<br/>
The trailhead is near Eugene Union Station, which is near Willamette <br/>
and about 4th or 5th street.  You're on your own for parking.  I <br/>
walk everywhere, and don't know where you can park around there <br/>
(although, presumably, there are places for you to leave your <br/>
vehicle).  From union station, cross the railroad tracks.  There is <br/>
a fence on the other side of the tracks, but there is a large <br/>
section ripped away, which will allow you to get through.  From <br/>
there, walk through the parking lot towards the base of the butte.  <br/>
You should see the trail head, starting up the hill and into the <br/>
woods.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:  Head up the butte on the hiking trail.  The trail <br/>
will cross a wide road; just keep going up.  Near the top, there <br/>
will be a split in the trail; take the right path (although, I <br/>
believe going straight will also get you to the top).  Soon you will <br/>
be at top of the butte, overlooking the fine city of Eugene.  From <br/>
here there is grassy lawn to the west.  Start walking down the path <br/>
that is to the left of the lawn.  Follow this as it circles around <br/>
the top of the butte.  Soon you will enter a wooded area.  A minute <br/>
or two after entering this wooded area, you will come across a <br/>
wooden seat on the left hand side of the path.  Sit down and take a <br/>
rest.  While sitting down, pull out your compass.  From this point <br/>
head 13 paces at 110 degrees, in the general direct of the bird <br/>
house #7.  The box is hidden at the base of a semi-fallen tree.  <br/>
<br/>
If you begin your hike from union station, plan for a total of an <br/>
hour, plus time to stamp in.  If you decide to drive up there, <br/>
figure 15 minutes, plus time to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
