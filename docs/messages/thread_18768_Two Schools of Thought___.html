                    <div class="plaintext-content">There seem to be two schools of thought here...  I really hate to <br/>
draw a line between "new letterboxers" and "not so new letterboxers" <br/>
because I think we all are looking to learn new things and share new <br/>
experiences, it's just that each group is looking for something <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
It only stands to reason that many of the newer members enjoy seeing <br/>
the posts with the questions that have been asked and answered a <br/>
million times -- they have the same questions.  Often their primary <br/>
reason for reading the list is to learn about letterboxing and share <br/>
things with others of like mind.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it also is logical that many of the "not so new <br/>
letterboxers" (not to be confused with experts, because really we <br/>
don't claim to be) are easily exasperated with seeing the same posts <br/>
over and over -- to the point that many, many of them do not even <br/>
frequent the list any longer.  Somebody mentioned that there are <br/>
1600 users, but only about 10% ever post.  I daresay 50% of the <br/>
registered users on this list check in less than once a month.  Not <br/>
that they have stopped letterboxing -- just that they no longer find <br/>
anything useful to them here and go about participation in the hobby <br/>
without the social aspect of the list, or find that in the many <br/>
regional lists that have sprouted from this list.  Those of us who <br/>
do still hang around here on occasion do so looking for something <br/>
that is getting harder and harder to find -- exchange of <br/>
letterboxing ideas with others who have been through some of the <br/>
same experiences as us -- generally on a different level than most <br/>
of the newbie posts.<br/>
<br/>
For a long time this was very much an underground kind of game -- <br/>
new players learned by word of mouth or by a very infrequent <br/>
newpaper article.  A few made their way to the list and were <br/>
diligent enough to educate themselves about the hobby and are still <br/>
around.  Most didn't have the dedication or lost interest or became <br/>
frustrated because nobody would help them solve Mapsurfer clues or <br/>
the Dancing Men and left.  Just as, I daresay, a good majority of <br/>
the newbies who post at present will do within the next 6 months.  <br/>
But with the deluge of articles in local newspapers, homeschooling <br/>
and family fun magazines over the past year, the whole face of this <br/>
game has changed drastically and the original flavor significantly <br/>
diluted.<br/>
<br/>
Since there seems to be two distinct groups of letterboxers, perhaps <br/>
there should be two lists...  One where newbies are free to post <br/>
questions that are easily answered in the FAQ and tell tales of <br/>
little Timmy's first trip to the woods, and help each other with <br/>
clues that the rest of us would rather figure out on our own.  <br/>
Another where letterboxers who have weathered a number of <br/>
finds/plants and have had some experience with (not necessarily <br/>
mastered) the game can communicate on the same level with others who <br/>
play the game as they do.  Perhaps making this a closed group where <br/>
one would be required to have found and/or planted a certain number <br/>
of boxes or been participating in the hobby for a certain length of <br/>
time and/or nominated by somebody who was aready a member...<br/>
<br/>
You can't please everyone and perhaps the real problem here is that <br/>
there are two different perspectives (actually I am sure there are <br/>
hundreds, but loosely grouped, I think there are two sides to the <br/>
coin).  Why keep fighting over ownership of the one list?<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea...  (trying to be part of the solution, not the <br/>
problem).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think by default, clues are beginning to split into two anyways, <br/>
those easily found on letterboxing.org and those that find you or <br/>
that you at least have to seek out. I myself have begun playing <br/>
around with and thinking about the latter, and have found it an <br/>
intriguing and a worthy variation. Solving such a clue can be quite <br/>
satisfing. Indeed, sometimes even just realizing something is <br/>
(unexpectedly) a clue is a rush. As someone with little time to <br/>
search for boxes, I especially appreciate these special boxes - even <br/>
those I likely will never get to seek out. Of course published <br/>
and/or easy clues will always have their place for many reasons. <br/>
<br/>
But the question posed is whether the list should experience a <br/>
similar dichotomy. Ideally I say no but this is no ideal world. The <br/>
suggestion merits friendly debate. I keep a mental list of members <br/>
whose posts I always read. Sadly, while that list has grown in size, <br/>
the number of posts has dwindled. Some wonderful folks rarely or <br/>
never post anymore - to the loss of everyone on the list. Something <br/>
needs to change. Can we figure out how?<br/>

While I respect and admire your brainstorming to find a solution, I hope<br/>
you'll allow that it may not be so easy to divide letterboxers into two<br/>
groups;-)<br/>
I'm a brand new letterboxer who lives in an area of the country where<br/>
boxes are few and far between (I read longingly of the high density in<br/>
Connecticut!!!)and the few boxes within a day's drive are apparently<br/>
missing.<br/>
Before I joined this group I read everything I could find about the<br/>
subject and the minute I joined I poured through the archives.<br/>

There's no way I would ever be able to get to join this group.  There  are <br/>
three letterboxes in my area.  The others are way to far away for just  a day <br/>
trip.  The hobby is new to my area.  Yes there are a bunch of us  newbies that <br/>
ask alot of questions but then just direct whoever to the site they  need or <br/>
delete the email.  I love hearing about the more experienced  letterboxers and <br/>
their stories.  I also love getting ideas and insparation  from them.  It would <br/>
be a pity to not have that on a group.  Imagine  an bunch of newbies trying <br/>

4th of July and passed it around and said "These are directions to a <br/>

   Then I explained what it is we do on our days off.... It was a <br/>
slow and uneventful day and by the end of it, I/we, with help from <br/>
my fellow workers, had a good idea where to start. <br/>
   Personally, I tend to visit the list at least once a day but <br/>
rarely post at all.  I enjoy reading the different posts, paying <br/>
special attention to the ones near RI.  We found our first <br/>
letterboxes on 7-17-02.  I don't know what that "makes" us.  All I <br/>
know is that letterboxing "makes" us a happier couple.<br/>
   What's the point?  ..Letterboxing makes us happy..I read the list <br/>
and rarely post...I hope to improve my carving skills....A walk in <br/>
the woods is fun....We met Pete and Wanda a few weeks ago.....and I <br/>
guess that's that and I'll withdraw and return to lurker status.<br/>

there SHOULD be a separate list for "newbies", if only to shield <br/>
them from the elitism and arrogance of certain "not so new" <br/>
letterboxers. "Barking up the wrong tree", indeed!  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone on this list was new at one point.  If all were greeted to <br/>
this game with this sort of fanfare, then there wouldn't be a game.  <br/>
<br/>
Kate and I have been 'boxing for a year (as of the 17th of this <br/>
month), and in that time we've managed to place our share of boxes.  <br/>
To see the signature stamp of a "newbie" in our log books is a <br/>
genuine thrill to us because it could possibly mean the taking root <br/>
of the game in our state, and maybe even the proliferation of boxes <br/>
for us to find as well.  They say "the more the merrier" and in this <br/>
case that is true.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I see it, the "problem", if indeed there is one, is easily <br/>
solved with the pressing of the "delete" button, or the scanning of <br/>
a subject line. <br/>
<br/>
I don't usually toss my two cents into a maelstrom, but this sort of <br/>
discourse tends to give "not so new" boxers a bad image.<br/>

&gt; &gt; trip.  The hobby is new to my area.  Yes there are a bunch of <br/>
us  <br/>
&gt; newbies that <br/>
&gt; &gt; ask alot of questions but then just direct whoever to the site <br/>
&gt; they  need or <br/>
&gt; &gt; delete the email.  I love hearing about the more experienced  <br/>
&gt; letterboxers and <br/>
&gt; &gt; their stories.  I also love getting ideas and insparation  from <br/>
&gt; them.  It would <br/>
&gt; &gt; be a pity to not have that on a group.  Imagine  an bunch of <br/>
&gt; newbies trying <br/>
&gt; &gt; to answer others questions.  LOL!<br/>

post than what was intended.  I was simply saying that I find the <br/>
lack of letterboxes in an area to be a lousy excuse for not <br/>
letterboxing.  There are two ways to play this game -- as a hunter <br/>
and a planter.  To hunt you are dependent on the boxes placed by <br/>
others and are indeed at a disadvantage if you live in a letterbox-<br/>
deprived location.  As a planter you are dependent only on your own <br/>
initiative and actually have a huge opportunity before you if you <br/>
live in a letterbox-deprived area.<br/>
<br/>
It has nothing to do with elitism or being new -- it has to do with <br/>
your zest for the game.  It is an equal-opportunity choice.  <br/>
Speaking as one who was faced with the disappointment of only having <br/>
3 boxes in my area when I first started letterboxing (the nearest <br/>
being about 2 hours away), I view a void of area boxes as an <br/>
unacceptable excuse.<br/>

&gt; Nice!  So much for being "part of the solution".  You know, maybe <br/>
&gt; there SHOULD be a separate list for "newbies", if only to shield <br/>
&gt; them from the elitism and arrogance of certain "not so new" <br/>
&gt; letterboxers. "Barking up the wrong tree", indeed!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Everyone on this list was new at one point.  If all were greeted <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; this game with this sort of fanfare, then there wouldn't be a <br/>
game.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kate and I have been 'boxing for a year (as of the 17th of this <br/>
&gt; month), and in that time we've managed to place our share of <br/>
boxes.  <br/>
&gt; To see the signature stamp of a "newbie" in our log books is a <br/>
&gt; genuine thrill to us because it could possibly mean the taking <br/>
root <br/>
&gt; of the game in our state, and maybe even the proliferation of <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; for us to find as well.  They say "the more the merrier" and in <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; case that is true.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as I see it, the "problem", if indeed there is one, is <br/>
easily <br/>
&gt; solved with the pressing of the "delete" button, or the scanning <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; a subject line. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don't usually toss my two cents into a maelstrom, but this sort <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; discourse tends to give "not so new" boxers a bad image.<br/>

You have a point Phyto, I will however have to hide a few more boxes <br/>
because I'm one of those people who have very few letterboxes close <br/>
by.<br/>
<br/>
Were talking maybe 10 boxes, last I checked, within a 100 miles or so <br/>
of where I live and of that 1 is MIA, 1 I hid, and I have found 3 of <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don't get to Nashville, Tn, much, (and when I do I usually <br/>
don't end where the boxes are for one reason or another), so well you <br/>
can see where this is going. <br/>
<br/>
On a brighter note, I have been scouting places to hide more boxes, <br/>
but I just haven't had a lot of time lately to work on it. <br/>
<br/>
I geuss I will have to try harder, but that's life sometimes.<br/>

I was refering to the idea of the list that you might have to have a  certain <br/>
