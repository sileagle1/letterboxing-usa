                    <div class="plaintext-content">Originally from J.K.Rowling's Harry Potter series, muggles are <br/>
non-magic people, normal humans, who are not aware of the wizards and <br/>
wizardry around them.<br/>
<br/>
The only other time I heard the term used regularly outside of the <br/>
Harry Potter series was in geocaching.<br/>
<br/>
 From one of the responses here, it sounds as though letterboxers have <br/>
also adopted the term.<br/>
