Is it me, or is the LBNA site, not adding boxes properly.  I tried <br/>
several times last night and again this mornign to add more boxes.  <br/>
I get allthe correct prompts "You box has been added, thankyou", <br/>
etc. but the box does not show up. I know this was happening around <br/>
Thanksgiving, it seems to be happening again. Why does this happen?<br/>
Is it me or the website?<br/>

Are they mystery boxes? If so, you should put ??? in the city, not Mystery <br/>
or Mystery? or anything else.<br/>
<br/>
Do they show up when you try to edit your letterboxes? Go to Member <br/>
Services &gt; <http: boxbyowner.asp="" www.letterboxing.org="">Your letterboxes and <br/>
see if they're on the list there.<br/>

Last night while doing some editing of my boxes I had some problems as<br/>
well. I ended up doing delete and them adding them back in as new<br/>
boxes. (Gotta love copy and paste, don't you?)<br/>
<br/>
When they didn't appear I took the step I should have taken the first<br/>
time. Patience.<br/>
<br/>
After waiting a while, I refreshed the page and there they were.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it's something simple, such as the site sometimes having<br/>
lots of traffic that holds things up.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

I also have followed the prompts but nothing but the disclaimer has<br/>
been showing up.  I re-read the FAQ's and have emailed the webmaster.<br/>
 So, we'll see if my box shows up any time soon.  This is my first<br/>
box, so perhaps it's just my learning curve.<br/>

I had an out of date clue for one of my boxes that I had forgotten to change and received a notice telling me that it had been removed and I needed to update. I really appreciate this kind of effort. <br/>
<br/>
Although I have eventually gotten responses from someone LBNA about problems, it has been after several attempts in a couple of cases and in a couple of cases, no response at all. They seem like very nice people, but I just never get the feeling that anyone is home, so to speak, whereas at atlasquest, someone is there and keeping an eye on things. Atlasqest put up Christmas graphics, a small thing, but it gives one the feeling that the site is attended to. I never get that feeling with LBNA, and before someone misreads that last statement, no I did not expect LBNA to put up Christmas graphics and am not basing my opinion just on that. <br/>
<br/>
Going back to a discussion that was here not too long ago regarding deleting boxes that have been sitting dead on the site for lord knows how long, no response from the owner, etc, it's my personal opinion that the space on LBNA is gradually getting less and less because hundreds of boxes are added all the time and none taken off. I have no idea how much space they have or what kind of sever they have, but problems seem to occur more and more often and eventually the site is going to become useless if old info is never removed and new info is added, ad infinitum. Granted, it's almost all text and not heavy graphics, but there has to be a limit to the space and it will be reached as long as info is added and none taken off. <br/>
<br/>
If I remember correctly no one from LBNA ever responded to that particular discussion. It would have and would be nice if someone would respond about the problems that seem to occur more and more often. If someone would  come here and make some kind of statement about recurring problems, it would make me feel like someone is home at LBNA. <br/>

   Try using the old Louisaina way of finding clues.  On the home <br/>
page click "Search for Boxes" then select the state your clue should <br/>
be in then click search.  If it doesn't show up that way then it <br/>
probably didn't take.  I can understand how daunting a task it is to <br/>
keep up with a site like LbNA.  <br/>
   I also agree more poeple should take the time to keep their boxes <br/>
and clues updated. Instead of trying to have the most finds or <br/>
plants, take the time to take care of the ones already planted.  <br/>

If lots of  people from a certain area go out every weekend and plant a bunch of boxes, eventually it seems like it would become kind of 'inbred', if you know what I mean. Someone from Conn posted here a while back and said that there was no place left in Conn to place a box. That may be an overstatement, but judging from the hundreds and hundreds listed, I can see it happening. I don't want to go out and find 30 or 40 boxes in one weekend. Where's the fun in that? It's fishing in a barrel. And I'd rather plant one really cool one that took some time to do than go out on weekends and plant tons of them each time. But that's just me. <br/>

The total database on LbNA is about 15MB, so I don't think that it's full.<br/>
There does seem to be a problem, although I added to test boxes without<br/>
difficulty today.<br/>

Another perspective.  I am very new to this - I hope to find my first box this weekend.  I will be doing this with my almost 5-year-old daughter, and when possible, my dog.  <br/>
<br/>
In this area there are a number of boxes that seem to be somewhat easy to find.  As a beginner with a child, just finding one a weekend will be a challenge.  While it may seem that the immediate area has a lot of boxes, I can think of several places that have not yet been honored.  So while experienced letterboxers may be able to find several a weekend and not be very challenged, we are very happy to start with plentiful easy boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to being able to work my way up to the more challenging boxes.<br/>

A lot of people seem to be really hung up on numbers. Not everyone, not even most, but quite a few.  If lots of  people from a certain area go out every weekend and plant a bunch of boxes, eventually it seems like it would become kind of 'inbred', if you know what I mean. Someone from Conn posted here a while back and said that there was no place left in Conn to place a box. That may be an overstatement, but judging from the hundreds and hundreds listed, I can see it happening. I don't want to go out and find 30 or 40 boxes in one weekend. Where's the fun in that? It's fishing in a barrel. And I'd rather plant one really cool one that took some time to do than go out on weekends and plant tons of them each time. But that's just me. <br/>

   Try using the old Louisaina way of finding clues.  On the home <br/>
page click "Search for Boxes" then select the state your clue should <br/>
be in then click search.  If it doesn't show up that way then it <br/>
probably didn't take.  I can understand how daunting a task it is to <br/>
keep up with a site like LbNA.  <br/>
   I also agree more poeple should take the time to keep their boxes <br/>
and clues updated. Instead of trying to have the most finds or <br/>
plants, take the time to take care of the ones already planted.  <br/>
