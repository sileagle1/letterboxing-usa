<br/>
I was searching around for maps of the various state parks and forests in <br/>
Northern New Jersey a few days ago, and happened upon a letterboxing <br/>
webpage... wow!  I'm very intrigued!  So I rushed out and bought some <br/>
supplies.  I attempted [several times] to make my own stamp, but alas... I <br/>
was always one of those kids in kindergarten who had trouble coloring in the <br/>
lines, and as such I'm one of those people who has trouble carving erasers <br/>
out of the lines.  =c)  Is it, well I don't want to say "against the rules", <br/>
but... bad letterboxing-ettiquete to write a little something in the books <br/>
instead?  I'm placing a box or two this weekend, but I've found store-bought <br/>
stamps which pretty much give a feel for the place they're in (though <br/>
they're not as nice as if they were personalized).  At any rate, when I find <br/>
one, is it allright to write something instead of "signing" it with my <br/>
stamp?<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Patrick, I would go to a calligraphy store to look for a stamp.  Most stores like that have thousands of stamps.  Chances are you can find something that captures your persona.  I would think a bought stamp would be better than a note by itself.  I have only found a few boxes, but I have found a couple that have been previously visited by the same person.  Part of the fun is getting to know your fellow letterboxers by their stamp design.  It's something about them that you can only learn by crossing their path through a logbook.  Give others a chance to know you by your stamp as well.

                    <html><body>Welcome, Patrick.  It's nice to hear we have a new 'boxer in Northern NJ.
<br/>
<br/>I agree with Celticrice, it's nice to look through a logbook and find familiar stamps.  Many of us use store bought stamps for our personal ones.................they're usually the first we need/want  As we get more into the hobby we begin to carve stamps for the boxes we plant, but keep the store bought, personal ones because they've become known, and we're associated with them.  It won't belong before you start recognizing a half dozen or so stamps that are in most logbooks in the Northern, NJ area.
<br/>
<br/>Mary and I visited the letterboxes on Pyramid Mt. before we had a stamp. We wrote a note in the log books, but then when we had bought our signature stamp went back and stamped in with it.  In other words, don't let not having a stamp stop you from getting out there and 'boxing, but keep looking for something that's "you."
