Hermits Grave Letterbox<br/>
Placed July 26, 2002 by Magic Mike<br/>
<br/>
The Hermits Grave Letterbox is placed on Sequassen Boy Scout Reservation in <br/>
Winsted, Connecticut.  To get to the reservation, take Interstate 84 to <br/>
Route 8 North.  Get off at exit 46, Pinewoods Road.  Take a right off the <br/>
exit and travel it until the end of the road.  Turn Left and then the next <br/>
right on to West Hill Road.  You will see signs directing you to Sequassen.  <br/>
It is very noticeable on the right side of the road.  You may wish to check <br/>
in at the Ranger Station and tell them you are visiting the Hermits Grave.<br/>
<br/>
The Quinnipiac Council of the Boy Scouts of America established Camp <br/>
Sequassen in 1927.  Due to council mergers, it is now operated by <br/>
Connecticut Yankee Council and in 2002, celebrated its 75th anniversary.<br/>
<br/>
To get to the Hermits Grave, follow the signs that will take you past the <br/>
English Dining Hall and Clark Field, there you will go on to the Red/White <br/>
Trail which will take you past several campsites on the way to the Hermits <br/>
Grave.<br/>
<br/>
The history of the Hermit is from the book, Sequassen Secrets by Thomas C. <br/>
Mercaldo.  The legends surrounding the Hermit are among the highlights of <br/>
Camp Tradition.  However, little is known about the solitary man, except <br/>
that he lived alone and loved woods, taking great care to preserve the <br/>
natural beauty of the area.<br/>
<br/>
Who was the Hermit? What was his name? Why did he choose this wooded area to <br/>
live? Who buried him and placed the wooden cross on his shallow grave?<br/>
<br/>
What we do know for certain is that the Hermit lived alone in the Sequassen <br/>
woods, in the area surrounding an overflowing spring.  His home was small <br/>
and constructed of unfinished wood.  In 1942, the original shack burned down <br/>
but was soon rebuilt.  Great pains were taken to preserve the atmosphere of <br/>
the original shack by using some used but still serviceable lumber.  All <br/>
that remains from the original structure are the three boards in the wooden <br/>
doorframe.<br/>
<br/>
Southwest of the shack, a mound of earth is believed to be the grave of this <br/>
solitary woodsman.  A broken down wooden cross was removed from the grave <br/>
and replaced by a permanent headstone.<br/>
<br/>
There soon developed a tradition of putting something green, such as a leaf, <br/>
on the Hermits Grave.  The purpose of this gesture was to keep alive the <br/>
memory of the Hermit, and the love for nature, which his life exemplified.<br/>
<br/>
The nearby spring has flowed for centuries and its own legend has <br/>
developed.  During WWII, a former Scout, Edward Zimmermans plane was shot <br/>
down behind enemy lines, He wandered around Germany undetected with nothing <br/>
but a days worth of C rations and a canteen of water from the Hermits <br/>
Spring.  Miraculously, he is rescued three days later by fellow Scout <br/>
Anthony Savino whom he as not seen since they stayed together at Sequassen <br/>
in 1937.  This incredible coincidence fueled the legend that if you drink <br/>
from the Hermits Spring, you will always return to Sequassen.<br/>
<br/>
To find the Hermits Grave Letterbox, pay homage at the Hermits Grave, <br/>
reading the inscription at the headstone.  Take care to place something <br/>
green on the grave.<br/>
<br/>
At a bearing of 298 degrees, you will see a large rock about 30 paces away. <br/>
