The "Old 300" Letterbox can be found at Stephen F. Austin State <br/>
Historical Site, where Stephen F. Austin (The Father of Texas) began <br/>
the colonization of Texas with a Grant from Mexico to settle 300 <br/>
families. The site has a large statue of Austin, as well as a replica <br/>
of his only home in Texas, an original well dug by his colony, and <br/>
the J.J. Josey General Store.   Down the road is the SFA State Park, <br/>
with golfing, swimming, camping and hiking.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
Located 48 miles from Houston, the site is located near San Felipe, <br/>
Texas.  From Interstate 10, take exit #723.   Go North on Hwy 1458 <br/>
for about 3 miles.   You will pass Park Road 38 which enters the SFA <br/>
Recreation Area on the left, but continue straight for another 100 <br/>
yards to the Historical Marker sign, and the parking area on the left <br/>
for the Historical Site (just before the Brazos River).<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Start at the picket fence entry.  Walk west to the obelisk (15 <br/>
paces).  From here, go North (20 paces) to the Stephen F. Austin <br/>
statue.   Go around the right side of the square and visit the John <br/>
Bricker marker.  From this marker, note the month that Bricker was <br/>
killed on this spot ______ (hint:  between 1 and 9).  Proceed to the <br/>
back of the site to the log cabin (WSW).  On the front wall of this <br/>
replica of SFA's home you will find a plaque.  From the plaque, note <br/>
the last digit of the year Austin died _______ (hint; again between 1 <br/>
and 9, and was an important year through out Texas history).  From <br/>
the front porch, proceed south (14 paces) to the Town Hall marker.  <br/>
Read the marker, and note the month that the Hall was burned to avoid <br/>
Mexican capture _____ (Hint: between 1 and 9).  From this marker, go <br/>
East at 100 degree (30 paces) to the NorthWest corner of the General <br/>
Store.  At this time, add up the numbers you have collected <br/>
_______.    At the base of the building you will see brick pillars.   <br/>
Starting with the N.W. corner pillar (next to phone box), proceed to <br/>
the South West corner, counting the pillars.  Turn the corner and go <br/>
East, continuing your count.   The box is behind the "lucky" pillar <br/>
whose count matches your total from above.  Be careful reaching under <br/>
the building, and make sure no one sees you!   Now you have joined <br/>
the Old 300, and become part of Texas History!<br/>

The "Remember Goliad" Letterbox commemorates the brave Texans that <br/>
were executed at Presidio La Bahia on Palm Sunday, March 27, 1836.  <br/>
This old Spanish frontier fort became a key defensive position during <br/>
the Texas Revolution.  Col. James Fannin, and 341 of his men, were <br/>
well protected in the fortress, but left its safety to attempt to <br/>
rescue the defenders of the Alamo.  Fannin was caught in the open, <br/>
while trying to cross Coleto Creek (You can drive 10 miles to the <br/>
Fannin Battleground State Historic Park, off Hwy 59).   He and his <br/>
men were returned to the Presidio as prisoner of war, but due to the <br/>
losses Santa Anna took at the Alamo, he ordered all the men to be <br/>
executed immediately in retaliation.  Later that year, the Texans <br/>
defeated Santa Anna and the Mexicans at San Jacinto, with their war <br/>
cry of "Remember Goliad.Remember the Alamo".  Be sure to tour the <br/>
Presidio La Bahia, Fannin's Grave and the home of General Ignacio <br/>
Zaragoza (the home of the Spanish general that led his troops to <br/>
victory over the French, thus forming the Cinco de Mayo <br/>
celebration.   Also visit Goliad State Historical Park and its <br/>
missions.<br/>
