<br/>
I was planted by mlgainey on February 1, 2003, at Hanover Wayside Park<br/>
in Hanover County, Virginia. The nearest town is Ashland. Hanover<br/>
Wayside Park is on Rt. 301. This should be an easy, quick walk to find me!<br/>
<br/>
Park as close as possible to the shelter that has a wooden causeway<br/>
leading down to it.<br/>
<br/>
Walk down the wooden causeway and then to your left.<br/>
<br/>
Take the trail that runs beside the pond.<br/>
<br/>
Cross the bridge.<br/>
<br/>
Go up the wooden steps, staying on the path as it leaves the pond.<br/>
<br/>
Take the right fork.<br/>
<br/>
Take another right fork.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately after you cross the small bridge, go off-trail to your right.<br/>
<br/>
Walk beside the stream until you reach its end.<br/>
<br/>
A long fallen tree is laying across the stream's end.<br/>
<br/>
I am hidden by leaves beside this fallen tree near the root end.<br/>
<br/>
Please help yourselves to one of my brethren in addition to stamping<br/>
into me.<br/>
<br/>
Please rehide me well with leaves and leave me "hanging around" for<br/>
the next boxer to find!<br/>
