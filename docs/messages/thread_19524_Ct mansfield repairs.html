the exception of #12 which I hope will get out in the next 24 hours.<br/>
Also the nearby Opening Day has been replaced. There are slight clue<br/>
changes on the kettle Hole Series due to pioison ivy and shifts inb<br/>
the natural cover in the park.  These I will go in a nd coorect<br/>
shortly. Hope all who have been waiting for these repairs will enjoy<br/>
the series. Remember this is a high traffic park be discreet and cover<br/>
them up neat!   leader of the pack and 6, 4-H kids<br/>
