I replaced the Seahorse LB in Kittery Maine on Good<br/>
Friday while I was up visiting my Dad in nearby Eliot,<br/>
ME. I posted it April 21 (see # 25188). You also might<br/>
pop over to southern New Hampshire across the river at<br/>
Portsmouth, Newcastle &amp; Rye, NH (Rockingham county).<br/>
Happy Hunting!  Lobsta Lady<br/>

TeamGreenDragon is heading to Maine on 5/18/03 (the day after<br/>
the Gerbil gathering in CT). Our ultimate goal is Bar Harbor and<br/>
we will be driving up the coast looking for boxes. When are you<br/>
