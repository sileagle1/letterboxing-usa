I do the same thing. That's one of my favorite features of Outlook Express. I've got filters set up for most of my regular mail coming in . . . one for each of the Yahoo letterboxing groups, one for my Women of Faith stuff coming in as well as areas set up to put stuff I want to keep or to read later when I have time. I love it . . . it saves tons of time and keeps the clutter to a minimum. <br/>
