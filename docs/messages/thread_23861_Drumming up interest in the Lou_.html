<br/>
Greetings friends! I just got back from a frantic week of<br/>
letterboxing with my Mid-Atlantic friends, at the DE Games at<br/>
Killen's Pond State Park. Wow - what an event! Sewsowbizzy planted<br/>
over 70 boxes, and participants were given only one week to find as<br/>
many as they could - it was a blast!<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm back home in St. Louis, and wondering, what next? There are<br/>
SO few boxes around my area. Yes, I'm going to plant some more over<br/>
the next few months, but seriously - how does one generate<br/>
interest? Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to make my way mid-state in the next month or so; there<br/>
are loads of boxes to be had in Columbia and Fulton. But I'm about<br/>
tapped out on finds within an hour of home...I'm not jonesing yet,<br/>
but you know how it is when the letterboxing itch needs scratching!<br/>
<br/>
Also, another question - if I were to host an event in the Lou',<br/>
would anyone attend? What would you be interested in seeing at said<br/>
event?<br/>
