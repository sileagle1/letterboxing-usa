P.P.S. Randy, I'm sorry to hear people have been complaining about the <br/>
difficulty of your clues to such an extent that you've decided to take <br/>
them off the Web. There should be room for all kinds of clues, from <br/>
super easy to nearly impossible.  You should write clues that bring you <br/>
pleasure!  Otherwise, why bother?  Life's too short to sit around <br/>
boring yourself.  Should every composer write music that only children <br/>
or beginners can play?  Do we want our novelists and poets to limit <br/>
themselves to a third-grader's vocabulary?  Sure, it's humbling to <br/>
study a clue, set out to find the box, and utterly fail, but hey, <br/>
that's life.  Maybe we need to say somewhere prominently on the LBNA <br/>
site that it's normal and to be expected that you won't find every <br/>
letterbox you seek.<br/>
