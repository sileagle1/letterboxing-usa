This is a GREAT idea!  I love it.  Very thoughtful.<br/>
<br/>
Trail report:<br/>
<br/>
My son (who today took on the trail name "Jackrabbit") and I went boxing <br/>
today.  Only found 2 out of 4.  One of them was "reported missing."  We looked <br/>
anyway, but weren't too surprised when we didn't find it.  We found the "Here <br/>
Comes the Sun," and "Tiki God" boxes.  "Florida Friends" was the reported missing <br/>
one.  We also tried, but couldn't find "Loggerhead."  I have a very strong <br/>
feeling that if my husband had been with us, we'd have gotten that one.  He <br/>
tends to be more persistant with the ones that don't leap out at us right away, <br/>
and he's found several boxes I would have given up on.  The nature center we <br/>
were looking in is AMAZING, though, and we had a great time there, learning about <br/>
turtles.  And the newly-christened Jackrabbit got to hold a snake before we <br/>
left, which was really cool.<br/>
