years. But, their red lid containers, which look to be their heavier <br/>
containers, leak. I am using two right now, but will replace with lock <br/>
and locks the next time I go up. Both had, just a little water, and <br/>
thank goodness I use the heavyweight freezer bags inside for extra <br/>
protection. <br/>
<br/>
Too bad to, the size container was perfect for how I like to set up a <br/>
box too :( .<br/>

Just thought I put in my 2 cents.<br/>

  Help - I tried to order the lock &amp; lock containers and was told they've<br/>
been discontinued. There must be another place, or two, or three, that sell<br/>
them. Can anyone help?<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you!<br/>

Man, I hope that's not true!  I just bought a couple at Target the <br/>
other day.  They have them in the same place they have the gladware <br/>
containers and such.<br/>
<br/>
They have another brand there called Snap and Lock which look <br/>
similar.  They seem inferior in quality to me, but I haven't tried <br/>
them, so I can't say for sure.<br/>

Don't spend TOO much on LnLs<br/>
<br/>
Target sells a very similar item, called snapware.  Walmart sells a 3 <br/>
pack of-I-can't-remember-which-exact-brand-but-same-difference.  Don't <br/>
know where you are but my local grocer store called King Soopers (same <br/>
chain as Kroger on East Coast) sell Snapware.<br/>
<br/>
I have a hard time believing that at the rate 'boxers alone buy these <br/>
items they'd be discontinued!<br/>
