someone finds a cache, they log their visit onto the web page <br/>
dedicated to that cache. that way, someone can look at the history of <br/>
the cache (like, who visited the cache, when was the cache last <br/>

a form of communication from the cacher to the placer regarding the <br/>
cache.<br/>

now, i realize that this would add to the complexity of the existing <br/>
letterbox web site...and i like the web site!  but i really miss <br/>
being able to research the box a little more prior to going on my <br/>
adventures.<br/>

just an idea....don't know how to do this.  :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The one thing we really appreciate is when people post with SitRep's <br/>
(situation reports)...just saying which boxes they have found or not found...or other <br/>
situational info (eg it's really muddy or there's loads of poison ivy or the <br/>
park gate doesn't open until noon etc).<br/>
<br/>
CSCM always researches all posts regarding a particular box before we go out.<br/>
So if he runs a search of the LBNA talk list archive on "Crocker Mystery, <br/>
Massachusetts" for instance, he can scan by date when and whether it was last <br/>
found. (Of course once we get to the box we might find it's been found by many <br/>
more people who never posted to the list to say they found it).<br/>
<br/>
We might still risk a trip if the last post says they didn't find it, but <br/>
that there was lots of snow on the ground, but if someone posts that the box was <br/>
strewn about and the stamp gone, we'd know not to bother.<br/>
<br/>
So we like to see folks post about their outings. Here in New England, folks <br/>
are great about SitReps, but if I was going to travel, I would sure find it <br/>
helpful to have a bunch of 'matches' come up when searching the archive for a <br/>
particular box or series.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's fine for an owner to list a box as MIA or Out of Commision or <br/>
Retired or such, but there have been lots of boxes posted as MIA by searchers <br/>
that were really just overlooked, or that folks were looking in the wrong place <br/>
(e.g. the Hancock Hill box in MA). We were excited to learn that it really <br/>
wasn't lost but instead never really found. It was the Sit Rep posts that kept us <br/>
from bothering...until Team Green Dragon went boldly to find it and DID find <br/>
it. Yay!<br/>
<br/>
I don't really consider a box MIA unless it is confirmed by the owner of the <br/>
box, and I don't really think we need an official MIA list...just consistent <br/>
posts to the list by searchers and owners :-)<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">i wonder, just wonder, if an additional message board could be added <br/>
to the Yahoo site? For example, one could post that they placed a <br/>
box, being specific with the subject heading - i.e., the name of the <br/>
box and state. then once someone finds it or not finds it, they could <br/>
report it on that message board. <br/>
<br/>
of course, if this were to occur, many, many boxes would have to be <br/>
grandfathered in...but so many boxes are being placed now and maybe, <br/>
just maybe some of us could help to log in the existing boxes.<br/>
<br/>
just another suggestion..i know that keeping a web page and such is a <br/>
lot of work and i'm not asking anyone to go beyond what they are <br/>
capable of doing.<br/>

Electronic log would be ideal, but image this would require a ton of <br/>

Issue still comes in with boxes that are not assigned.  I would have <br/>
no problem handling email updates for all Texas orphan boxes, and <br/>
I'm sure others would volunteer in other states.  <br/>

have <br/>
