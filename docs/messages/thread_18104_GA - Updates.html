<br/>
*Hidden Agenda - alive and well, and a very cool location.<br/>
*Land of the Lost - alive and well, and a very cool stamp.<br/>
*Lullwater Easter Egg - alive and well, even tho the magnolia tree in <br/>
one of the clues is not; it's a stump now. And the bench is rotting <br/>
into the ground. (This was Georgia's first ever letterbox, placed on <br/>
Easter weekend in 2000, and things have changed in the park since <br/>
then.) This is located in a great park on the Emory University <br/>
campus. <br/>
<br/>
Great fun, each one for different reasons.<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails!<br/>
