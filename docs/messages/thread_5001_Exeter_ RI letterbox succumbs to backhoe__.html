for various reasons. We tried to find the Mercy Brown, Exeter Vampire <br/>
letterbox today. The clues were easy until we reached the back of the <br/>
cemetery. Then we saw signs of recent heavy equipment work, apparently for <br/>
the purpose of expanding the cemetery. We fear that the big rock that was <br/>
hiding the letterbox was one of the ones that was rolled over, with much <br/>
movement of earth around it. That would be sad, considering that Mercy was <br/>
a real historical character with a great supernatural legend built up <br/>
around her life, death, and thereafter. This box was also a group effort. <br/>
Can someone give us good news?<br/>
<br/>
We took pictures of the grave and mausoleum. Nice idea for a letterbox <br/>
theme.<br/>

Bob "the RI Wizard" moved it to Fisherville Brook a couple of months <br/>
ago after construction started.  The new clues are posted on the LbNA <br/>
website.  There are several other boxes at that location to add to <br/>
your boxing pleasure!<br/>

Bob Hopkins (the RI Wizard) moved this box a few months ago.  The updated clues<br/>
can be found on the LbNA website.  The good news is that it is located with<br/>
several other boxes to add to your boxing pleasure...<br/>
