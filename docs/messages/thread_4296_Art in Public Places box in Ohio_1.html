The 1st box placed in the series: Art in Public<br/>
places.  To find the area where to look for these<br/>
letterboxes all you have to do is go to<br/>
sculpturecenter.org/oosi/oo.asp. Once here you go to<br/>
searching oosi, you can either enter the artist name<br/>
or the name of the letterbox title under advance<br/>
query. This will take you to the site about this<br/>
sculpture and where it is located. Once you find out<br/>
where to head then read the clues to find the<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Boston Artist Ralph Helmick created this Sculpture of<br/>
the Wyandot Native American Chief Leather lips in<br/>
1990. The sculpture is a 12-foot high portrait of<br/>
Leatherlips. The head is a composite structure of<br/>
various sizes of native limestone stacked and<br/>
mortared. The head is open on the top and extended<br/>
back along its sides, creating a small enclosure,<br/>
which enables you to have a view of the river.<br/>
<br/>
Once you arrive at this park, go to the bronze plaque<br/>
that tells about the sculpture. After reading the<br/>
information look at 342 degrees. You will see a set of<br/>
stairs going to the lower level of this park. Start<br/>
down the steps, at the fourth big post on your left,<br/>
stop. Look South, 5 steps from this post is a<br/>
moss-covered rock with three little rocks on the<br/>
downhill side. Under the rock is the letterbox. You<br/>
can easily get to this rock from the bottom or top of<br/>
the hill.<br/>
