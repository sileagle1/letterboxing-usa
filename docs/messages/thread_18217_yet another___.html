                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think there are advantages and disadvantages to both.  Forums are <br/>
nice because they segregate messages by topic.  In the same respect <br/>
they can be bad because often one subject leads to another and useful <br/>
discussion takes place in a forum not related to the topic.  And I am <br/>
sure there are many other valid arguments on both sides.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Ryan though, it comes down to what people get used to <br/>
doing and it is extremely difficult to change mid-stream.  I saw this <br/>
with the Carving Consortium -- they had a Yahoo group for a long time <br/>
and people were comfortable with that scenario.  For a while they did <br/>
both the Yahoo list and a Forum, and then went to strictly the <br/>
Forum.  Many people left -- just never made the switch.<br/>
