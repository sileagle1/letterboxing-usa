Byrd Mill Road Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed:  18 August 2002  <br/>
Replanted with new, improved stamp:  5 Oct 2002<br/>
<br/>
Byrd Mill Road: A winding road in some areas just wide enough for a <br/>
covered wagon, Byrd Mill Road was used by settlers to flee to safety <br/>
at Fort Steilacoom during the Indian Wars of 1855. In later years it <br/>
was the established route from the Fort to Puyallup. It was the <br/>
first road in Washington State.<br/>
An addition to the state system was made by the 1941 legislature by <br/>
the passage of Chapter 225 establishing as Washington State <br/>
Historical Road No. 1, "Byrd's Mill Road", a road leading from an <br/>
intersection with Secondary State Highway No. 4D, in Puyallup, to an <br/>
intersection with Primary State Highway No. 1, at South 84th Street <br/>
near the south limits of Tacoma, and thence following the old <br/>
pioneer road crossing Chambers Creek near the old "Byrd's Mill" to <br/>
Puget Sound, at Steilacoom. This road was the first road to be <br/>
established by law in Washington, it being established by the <br/>
legislature of Oregon Territory in 1852, and after Washington <br/>
Territory was formed its legislature acted to establish it as a <br/>
Military road by laws of 1854-56-57.   Along this route in 1864, <br/>
there was built the Russian-American Telegraph line which was <br/>
proposed to extend to Europe by way of Bering Strait &amp; Asia. <br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  From `behind' Dr. Perkin's sign, look 10 degrees.  Do you <br/>
see a yellow, brown-capped turret in the distance?  Toward the <br/>
castle you go!  Look for a monument dedicated to the 1st Road in <br/>
Washington just before the turret.  Behind it on the right, you will <br/>
find your treasure.  Be inconspicuous when poking around in this <br/>
areathis is a high visibility area and please hide me well when <br/>
you're through!!!  The gardener got me the first time!!!<br/>
