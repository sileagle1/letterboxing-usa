The interesting thing is that the prices for these carving materials<br/>

this together.!<br/>

The one other alternative I'd like to throw out is the B grade <br/>
PZKut.  The consistency is the same as the A grade (before it was <br/>
orange), it is cheaper than the A grade and it is still white.  I <br/>
switched to B grade a couple of years ago when they were tempo<br/>
rarily out of the A grade and have been using it ever since.  I've <br/>
never been disappointed with it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the suggestion, SpringChick, I appreciate the input. The<br/>
Stampeaze website was down when I first put this comparison together<br/>
so the product info and prices were unavailable to me at the time.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree with your suggestion, we also have used the Grade "B" PZ-kut<br/>
and been quite happy with it. However, after exchanging some email<br/>
with Justin, I'm still not sure how long they will continue to carry<br/>
the Grade "B" (white) old style/formula PZ-kut, which was what<br/>
prompted the search for alternative carving materials.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: I just checked and found their website is available again. As of<br/>
1pm EST there were 29 pieces of the PZ-kut Grade "B" (white) in stock.<br/>
<br/>
So I did update the cost comparison file and add the info on the<br/>
PZ-kut Grade "B" (white) material and their website address to the<br/>
others. TIMESAVER: if you've already viewed the file and unsubscribed<br/>
from my yahoogroup, it cots eight cents per square inch. <br/>
