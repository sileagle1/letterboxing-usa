In  Hyde Park, NY in Dutchess County<br/>
Vanderbilt Mansion, National Historic Site<br/>
go to  http://www.nps.gov/vama/vamahome.html   for<br/>
more info<br/>
<br/>
This site has great views of the Hudson River from<br/>
many places.  I also suggest taking a tour of the<br/>
mansion if you have time to do so.  Be careful if you<br/>
are going during winter, as it often snows or gets<br/>
icy.  happy hunting!<br/>
<br/>
Vanderbilt Letterbox <br/>
<br/>
Start from the first parking lot and continue across<br/>
the way towards the visitor center (this is the place<br/>
where you can get tickets if you wish to go on a tour<br/>
of the house).  Continue left along the path towards<br/>
the mansion.  We chose to walk in front of it, but you<br/>
can walk behind to see the view of the Hudson.  In any<br/>
case, follow the trail to the left towards the Italian<br/>
rose gardens.  Across from the rose gardens, notice a<br/>
small marked trail to the right of the green bench. <br/>
Follow this between the bushes and into the woods. <br/>
The trail will come out to a paved road, walk along<br/>
this around the bend and go past the no biking sign<br/>
and onto the marked trail.  Keep going past the area<br/>
where the fence on the left is open (although this is<br/>
a beautiful area to see the river from).  A little<br/>
while down the path you'll notice a semi-open area on<br/>
your left that is between too very large rock walls. <br/>
Notice that a bend in the trail begins here.  Continue<br/>
until you see a foot wide rock in the path and walk 65<br/>
paces.  Look left to the tree with the "horseshoe" -<br/>
like roots, (there is a semi-worn path towards it). <br/>
Walk past this tree, and climb the rocks and continue<br/>
straight towards even larger rocks.  Notice the twin<br/>
Canadian Hemlock trees. (for those who dont know what<br/>
these trees look like, they have needles instead of<br/>
leaves). Behind the left one and under some rocks is<br/>
the Vanderbilt Letterbox! You should see some very<br/>
beautiful views from this point, although you may have<br/>
to squat a little.  Again, please be careful, b/c the<br/>
rocks can be very slippery<br/>

is a type in this clue... it is in Dutchess County, NY<br/>
not in duchess.  And the semi-open area is on the<br/>
right hand side, not the left hand side.  If this<br/>
could be fixed on the lbna site, I would appreciate<br/>
it.  Thanks<br/>
