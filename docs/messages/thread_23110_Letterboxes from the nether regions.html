<br/>
As we've been talking about places we've seen or heard of that we could <br/>
hide<br/>
letterboxes,<br/>
my sister and I have been coming up with totally impossible/silly <br/>
places, too.<br/>
I'm guessing<br/>
that some of you have played this game as well. We've talked about <br/>
placing a<br/>
letterbox on<br/>
a dog or in a car...things you obviously couldn't do, but we got a good <br/>
chuckle<br/>
out of it.<br/>
<br/>
If this is just a newbie thing, I'll shut up about it, but we've been <br/>
