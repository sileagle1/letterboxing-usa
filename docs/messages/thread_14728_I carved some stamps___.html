done something artistic!!  I went last week (I think...) and got some <br/>
stuff to carve out some stamps.  I carved the sig stamp for my <br/>
daughter, Trinity Jah, and the word Ewok for me.  I am currently <br/>
having a friend trace out my tattoo so that I can carve it.  I am <br/>
hoping that she gets it so that it is more like a cartoon so that I <br/>
don't have to try and figure out how to carve the fur.  That will <br/>
wait until I am better.  I am planning an outing next week and <br/>
hopefully over this weekend.  I do have some questions though.  I got <br/>
a block of 1/2" thick Mastercarve because it was cheaper :).  Has <br/>
anyone gotten this cut in half?  I think I will leave mine full <br/>
thickness as I am not going to mount them, but for placing a box I <br/>
feel the stamp should be mounted.  I tried my cheese slicer and it <br/>
didn't work.  I did try a knife, but all mine are not anywhere near <br/>
sharp and I haven't gotten myself a sharpener yet.  Did this only <br/>
work with the "pink stuff"?  My other comment is about getting <br/>
pictures mirrored and actually onto the carving material.  I first <br/>
tried the print it and acetone method and didn't get clean bright <br/>
lines, so I went out and bought a $2 pad of tracing paper.  I traced <br/>
using a No.2 HB pencil.  I set the material on there and pressed a <br/>
little bit and presto!!  Beautiful bright clean lines.  I read <br/>
someone used a mechanical pencil and as a drafting student with a <br/>
lousy 2-year degree, I know that most mechanicals that are out there <br/>
are some really hard lead.  Make sure that you are using a softer <br/>
lead which is the HB above.  I don't remember what the HB means, but <br/>
I know that it is softer.  Just wanted to update ya'all and share <br/>
some of a first-timers experience.  Holla' at ya'all soon!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">try ironing it on a low heat.  It is more consistent and doesn't transfer<br/>
paper with the ink.  Just don't touch the carving medium to the iron<br/>
directly.  I'm getting more consistent results with that than with acetone.<br/>
I like tracing too, but if the picture is quite detailed, it becomes more<br/>
difficult.<br/>
