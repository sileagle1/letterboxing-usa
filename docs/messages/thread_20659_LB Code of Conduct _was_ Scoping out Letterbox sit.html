&gt; Wonder if there is a rule<br/>

&gt; places"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are many stated and unstated rules in this game. In England<br/>
there is a letterboxing code of conduct. In this country, there are<br/>
some things that are still up in the air and not officially written. I<br/>
applaud the Green Tortuga for having done such a thing on this site:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/aboutlb/rules/<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, it is up to YOU - the letterboxer and the letterbox<br/>
maintainer to be responsible for minimizing the impact that occurs to<br/>
natural places.<br/>
<br/>
It would be wonderful if this approach was instated on a national<br/>
level to give letterboxing more credit for some of the intuitive<br/>
education that happens when people place boxes in areas that just<br/>
"beg" for a letterbox. There is a certain amount of reading the<br/>
natural landscape that should always occur - even with an urban box.<br/>
If you're not paying attention to your surroundings (esp. with boxing)<br/>
then you might really be off.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
