                    <div class="plaintext-content">     I looked into SpringChick's questions. Our friend at Fish and <br/>
Wildlife says that the Mason Neck National Wildlife Refuge wants no <br/>
letterboxes in the Refuge. If you have boxes planted there, they <br/>
would like them to be removed, and the clues taken off the website.  <br/>
If anyone has questions, please e-mail Marty_McClevey@fws.gov.<br/>
     Mason Neck State Park is a different place from the Refuge, <br/>
although they border each other in some places. (I didn't know all <br/>
this!)Our friend is NOT talking about the boxes in Mason Neck State <br/>
Park. <br/>
     Hope this helps!<br/>
