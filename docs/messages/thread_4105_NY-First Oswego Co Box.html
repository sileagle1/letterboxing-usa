<p>The Hojack Trail</p>
<p>The Lake Ontario Shore Railroad Company organized in Oswego on March 17, 
1868. Work on the railway began in August of 1871 in Red Creek, Wayne County. 
The Railroad roughly parallels the southern shore of Lake Ontario stretching 
from Oswego to Rochester.</p>
<p>Many people fondly called the R.W.&amp; 0. by its nickname, "Hojack." It 
seems that in the early days of the railroad, a farmer in his buckboard drawn by 
a bulky mule was caught on a crossing at train time. When the mule was halfway 
across the tracks, he simply stopped. The train was fast approaching and the 
farmer naturally got excited and began shouting, "Ho-Jack, Ho-Jack." Amused by 
the incident, the trainmen began calling their line the "Ho-Jack." Abandoned in 
1978, the former rail way has been for the most part designated for recreational 
use. The trail has low grades and is an easy hike and great for biking. </p>
<p>How to get there:</p>
<p>Starting point is Hannibal, NY.</p>
<p>Turn north off route 3 onto Oswego street.</p>
<p>Park in the large parking area on the left-hand side of the road, just north 
of the Community Center. The Community Center is a former church and houses the 
Library, pre-school and senior center. </p>
<p>Clues:</p>
<p>Difficulty: Easy</p>
<p>Placed: January 6, 2002</p>
<p>Continue north on Oswego Street.</p>
<p>Turn left onto mill street, crossing Sterling Creek. Pass a magnificent aged 
maple tree, among others, on your right. Across from a gray building, you will 
find a drive (300 degrees.) Follow this to the top of the rise and through (or 
around) the gate. </p>
<p>Stay on the trail as you pass abandoned farm equipment, some side trails, 
etc. On either side of the trail you’ll see the torn up ties of the old track. 
</p>
<p>Shortly, the trail will begin to converge with the road.</p>
<p>Align the eastern edge of a red barn, a tree, and a stump to point to a 
bifurcated tree.</p>
