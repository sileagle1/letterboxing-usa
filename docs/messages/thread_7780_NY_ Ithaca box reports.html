Plantations box was in great shape, but the second log book is almost <br/>
completely filled - so many wonderful stamps to look at in the two books! <br/>
The Snoop Doggy Rubbermaid box had quite a bit of water in it so we dried <br/>
it out. Fortunately the stamp and log were snug and dry in their bags.<br/>
<br/>
We visited Buttermilk Falls and Lake Treman this morning and found both <br/>
Downstream Deliverance and Monster Tamer in fine shape. The walk along the <br/>
Buttermilk Falls Gorge is so amazing that finding Downstream Deliverance <br/>
was simply a bonus on top of spending some time in one of my very favorite <br/>
places. Monster Tamer almost proved elusive but we finally tracked it down.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Trio, Cindy and Space Traveler for four great boxes in four <br/>
beautiful locations!<br/>
