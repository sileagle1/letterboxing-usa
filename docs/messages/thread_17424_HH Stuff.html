that one of my hitchhikers has now been to two gatherings!  For the <br/>
record, I do not want my hitchhikers going to gatherings.  I want <br/>
them found by accident in pre-existing letterboxes.  A nice surprise <br/>
for the finder, not cluttered with a dozen other hitchhikers sitting <br/>
on a table where they lose their identity.<br/>
<br/>
Others might not have a problem if their hitchhikers visit a <br/>
gathering, but I'd rather mine not.  If you must bring it to a <br/>
gathering, at least hide it in a box there!<br/>

Thanks for listening....<br/>

To me, the letterboxing is all about the hunt and the prize and appreciating what others have done.  On the other hand, if someone gets a HH and then finds that they won't be able to keep it moving (maybe they've gotten deployed and can't replant it or something), then it's best to give it away to someone who'll keep it going in true Style.<br/>

about.  I enjoy seeing hitchhikers that I would likely never <br/>
encounter in the wild at gatherings.  While I will make reasonable <br/>
efforts to accomodate peoples wishes, I'm not going to agonize about <br/>
it.  If I'm fortunate enough to have a hitchhiker in my possession <br/>
when I attend a gathering, it will most likely go with me.  If those <br/>
there don't wish to see it, they don't have to look.  The idea that <br/>
anybody could release something into the wild and believe they can <br/>
control details of its existence forever more astounds me.  They must <br/>
live in a much more uptight world than my laid back little corner of <br/>
Appalachia.<br/>
<br/>
It is not my intention to offend anyone with this - it is simply my <br/>
frank and honest opinion on the discussion at hand.  <br/>

<br/>
It had worked for several years where hitchhikers never showed up at <br/>
gatherings, so it *seemed* like such a tradition would continue.  <br/>
I'm not out to kill the new tradition (although I don't much like <br/>
it, I will admit), but I feel like my hitchhikers should live by <br/>
the "old rules" they were introduced in.<br/>
<br/>
Under the old rules, that's how we used to find hitchhikers.  They <br/>
were rare, spontaneous, and a pleasure to find.  Call me old <br/>
fashioned, but I liked things that way.<br/>
<br/>
Under the protective flag of "there are no rules", I could go out, <br/>
collect everyone's letterboxes, and bring those to a gathering for <br/>
people to sign in.  And maybe return the boxes to their proper homes <br/>
if I feel like getting around to it someday.  If I did something <br/>
like that, a revolt would rise it's ugly head and say I shouldn't be <br/>
removing other people's boxes because that's not what the boxes were <br/>
placed for.  They were placed for people to find.<br/>
<br/>
Well, so were my hitchhikers.  I want people to go out and look for <br/>
my hitchhikers, and I don't mean at the next gathering.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I felt the need to throw in my 2 cents because I think I was the party <br/>
guilty of suggesting a HH exchange at gatherings. The origional intent of <br/>
the HH exchange was sort of like a grab bag. You bring a HH, toss it in a <br/>
basket and take another in exchange to hide where ever your letterboxing <br/>
travels bring you. The intent was not as a stamping frenzy but it was a way <br/>
for HH's to travel to different locations and even different States. One of <br/>
my HH's that began in Connecticut was brought out to California and released <br/>
via a gathering. I think it's a fun exchange and a great way to sent HH's in <br/>
new directions<br/>
<br/>
Now that I've cleared the air and my conscience I will bid you all well.<br/>
