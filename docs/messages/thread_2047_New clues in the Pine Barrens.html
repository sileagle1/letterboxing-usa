Those of you who like wandering the NJ Pine <br/>
Barrens may enjoy these clues.  The Pines <br/>
are an incredible letterboxing venue, offering <br/>
the perfect mix of natural setting, history, <br/>
lore, ghosttowning, puzzles, and unique <br/>
clue writing possibilities in the Mid Atlantic <br/>
region -- always nice ingredients in <br/>
letterboxing.  To top if off, if you go to<br/>
right place, you can get those delicious <br/>
old-fashioned stick candies, which otherwise<br/>
can be difficult to find sometimes :-)<br/>
<br/>
The first one is more of a pure ghosttowner<br/>
play more than a traditional letterbox hike ... <br/>
but if you like hunting for old town sites, here <br/>
it is:<br/>
<br/>
Calico Honeymoon (v. difficult, 4 stars)<br/>

<br/>
This one can be thought of as letterboxing <br/>
in 4 dimensions (if you use your imagination :-)<br/>
with doses of all the things that make Pine<br/>
Barrens letterboxing unique and exciting to me:<br/>
<br/>
Time Traveler (difficult, 3 stars)<br/>

<br/>
You may need a modern browser to view the second<br/>
one properly (I'm not sure how modern but netscape<br/>
4.7 and IE 5 seem to somewhat work, IE 3 doesn't).  <br/>
I hate to do this, but that is part of the <br/>
puzzle -- not because I want to, but because of my <br/>
severely limited time and html skills.  I'll fix <br/>
it someday, or someone out there can help me if <br/>
they want (please send browser comments off-list).<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Randy<br/>
