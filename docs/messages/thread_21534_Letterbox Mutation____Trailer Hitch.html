Some of you are going to hate this....<br/>
<br/>
Here is a type of letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I'll call it a Trailer Hitch.<br/>
<br/>
It does not get put into a box and hidden away with clues to find it.<br/>
<br/>
It is handed from boxer to boxer who meet by chance or design.<br/>
<br/>
It happens all the time with regular hitchhikers....but these will be <br/>
intentionally homeless.<br/>

in another letterboxers possessions or on their body. They were designed my<br/>
Camp Fire Lady and pandora for our Battleground gathering last summer. The<br/>
kids had a BLAST sneaking around trying nto slip them into people's things,<br/>
and the adults had a blast tyring to look "innocent" so the kids would slip<br/>
them to us. <br/>

I'm just now catching up on a month's worth of messages...busy times.<br/>
<br/>
I have been gathering the supplies to make something of this sort. I <br/>
didn't know if there was a name for such a "box" that would travel <br/>
from person to person, and I was going to ask the board about it. <br/>
Looks like I have a potential answer here! :) I'm excited about <br/>
getting mine out there soon. I just have to carve the stamps for it, <br/>
and it will be finished. Hooray! Thank goodness for spring break!<br/>
