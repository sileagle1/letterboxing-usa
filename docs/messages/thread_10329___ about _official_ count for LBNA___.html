<br/>
There aren't any hard, fast rules for how to count hitchhikers, and <br/>
people do them both ways.  Use whatever you feel works.  I count all <br/>
of my hitchhikers as Founds for no other reason than it's less <br/>
numbers to keep track of.  *shrug*  But whatever works for you, do <br/>
that.<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Don't worry I won't argue with the forest frog family. I really like that name. We count Hitchhikers and event stamps as finds just as we would when finding a hidden box. If others disagree, thats ok but that is how I do my PFX count. It's my understanding that it was originally only PFX no E or HH. Psychomommy has all sort of counts that she does, Including lizards, and thats ok too. Thats her choice and I think we can respect that. There really isn't any set rules in this. I do understand how people would like a set of guidelines to go by but to my knowledge there are none. Well, anyway, thats what Molly and I do......Chuck and Molly
