<br/>
Planted by The Family.  For this box that's Spunky Spaniel and rtrw<br/>
on a snowy October 26th ,2002 at about 7:30 in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty - easy to moderate<br/>
Time - probably an hour in and out if you just want the box.  <br/>
Directions to starting place -  Downtown Hillsboro, New Hampshire. <br/>
At the traffic light in the center of town, where Route 149 turns <br/>
toward Deering, head in the opposite direction at the intersection.  <br/>
You are on School Street, though I don't remember a sign on the <br/>
corner.  You will pass our beautiful library (home of another <br/>
letterbox).  You will pass the high school and, after a bit of a <br/>
drive, two  beautiful old farms.  Soon after Intrepid Farm turn right <br/>
into Fox Forest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Details you should know - <br/>
This is an amazing place, and it's huge.  Bring some more boxes to <br/>
plant when you come!  Fox Forest offers around 25 miles of wooded <br/>
trails to the public. The Forest began as a gift to the State by <br/>
Caroline Fox in the 1920s. She wished to see her summerhouse<br/>
preserved as a protected area. Under the guidance of the late Henry <br/>
Baldwin, it grew to include tree identification trails, rare tree <br/>
species, and a mushroom trail among others. There are trial guides in <br/>
the mailbox in the parking lot of the main entrance.<br/>
<br/>
Details that you probably don't care about - Henry Baldwin took <br/>
Butterbaby's mother and rtrw hiking up Mount Monadnock when we were <br/>
young.  He had us helping him plant baby evergreens.  I've never <br/>
forgotten that trip.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues:  From the parking lot find the kiosk that holds the maps and <br/>
information.  You are going to the Virgin Forest.  Head down the path <br/>
by the sign that points toward the trails.  You want to stay on the <br/>
ridge trail.  It was a little muddy the day we planted, so prepare<br/>
for that.  Enjoy the stroll though the woods.  <br/>
When you find the "Virgin Forest" sign in the virgin forest, you are <br/>
close.  Stand with your back to the interesting tree and stump with <br/>
the exposed growthy roots (you'll see) that has a small sign on it.  <br/>
Look past the trail pointer signs to a large boulder.  Head that way, <br/>
in fact.  The boulder is actually a split rock, and the thing you<br/>
seek is between a smaller rock and the boulder on the left as you<br/>
walk toward it.  In case you are having trouble, the trail signs are <br/>
about 30 steps from the boulder.    <br/>
<br/>
Please email rtrw@attbi.com with any needs the box may have.  Enjoy <br/>
our box.<br/>
