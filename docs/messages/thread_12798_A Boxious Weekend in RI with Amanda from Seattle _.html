                    <div class="plaintext-content">This weekend, I was totally rewarded with meeting Amanda from Seattle!  She <br/>
flew into Providence for an overnight, so a bunch of us met her at her hotel, <br/>
then took her out boxing.  Those who were there included Team Green Dragon, <br/>
Moonstone Baby, Rustypuff, CSCM, and Laurette.  After exchanging, we found <br/>
The Case of the Missing Mascot, both boxes in Central Falls, Dexter in North <br/>
Providence, and Going Downhill.  We also came across the First Snow HH while <br/>
out at Dexter.  We had a great time and hope Amanda will come and visit again <br/>
soon!  Hopefully she will be able to get a layover at Bradley so we can show <br/>
her around CT!<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, Moonstone Baby, Indy and I ventured out and found the Wooden <br/>
Carousel series, and Westerly Woods.  Jay: Westerly Woods box is cracked.  We <br/>
put it in a large baggie to hopefully keep the water out.  We then went back <br/>
to our respective houses to recoup!  THen, we went out and found #3, #4 and <br/>
#1 of the Lil' Rhody Runaround series and Falling Leaves.  We tried for the <br/>
Great Gathering, however I believe it to be missing.  We did find the <br/>
Sanctuary HH from Chicago at Falling Leaves, and the Up, Up and Away HH at <br/>
Box #3 of Rhody.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, a great weekend!  Thanks to everyone in RI for a great time!<br/>
