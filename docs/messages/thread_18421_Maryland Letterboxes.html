<br/>
<br/>
My spouse will be in northeast Maryland on business next week and the week<br/>
after. If all goes well, we plan getting together over the intervening<br/>
weekend and doing some "power" boxing in the area. We will be going out of<br/>
Joppa and I have big ambitions of doing letterboxing in Howard, Prince<br/>
George's and Baltimore counties. I have a number of questions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1)       Am I nuts to try and cover this much terrain? Not knowing traffic<br/>
conditions and things to avoid or do is a severe handicap. Do any of you<br/>
have some advice as far as driving conditions?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2)       Any MUST DO series?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3)       I noted that some of the boxes I had earmarked to try are either<br/>
pulled or missing. Any change in status?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
a.       Patterson Park Boat Lake in Baltimore City.<br/>
<br/>
b.       Slightly Sweet, Slightly Salty in the Stanley's Surprise series in<br/>
Columbia.<br/>
<br/>
c.       The entire Princess Turtle's 13th Birthday series.<br/>
<br/>
d.       The Maryland Terp in the Tornado Alley series in College Park.<br/>
<br/>
e.       The Tea Tortl in the Greenbelt Beverage Animals series in<br/>
Greenbelt.<br/>
<br/>

Thanks in advance,<br/>
