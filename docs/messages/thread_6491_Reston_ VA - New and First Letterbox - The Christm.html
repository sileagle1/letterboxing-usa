<p>The Christmas Tree Graveyards</p>
<p>It's only a 75 cent toll to drive out to Robert Simon's dream, Reston, a 
planned community of work, home and play in rolling Northern Virginia among 
preserved woods. A trek to the letter box will take you through a creek valley 
of tall trees in one of the natural areas of Reston, Virginia. From the Beltway, 
I-495, take the Dulles Toll Road, route 267, west to Hunter Mill Road. Left on 
Hunter Mill and right on Sunrise Valley Drive. Take the third left onto Cross 
School Road. First Right on Midsummer Drive. On your left you will come to 
Dayflower Court. There on the right is a small park. Park. Walk between the two 
benches down a steep path and across a gully. Youll pass the first Christmas 
Tree Graveyard. Follow the path down into the woods all the way down into 
woodpecker valley. Keep an ear open for Woody Woodpecker's relatives. Yes the 
big ones with the red feather crowns live here. Did you know you can tell which 
way is north in a forest by observing which side the moss grows on trees? You'll 
come to a T at the path that runs the length of this small valley. Turn right, 
north. The path heads along the swath cleared of trees for the water line. Look 
for tall dead trees with woodpecker holes. Youll pass a tall manhole cover and 
a muddy spring. You're following a creek way off to the side. Along the way, you 
will also see a tall tree, split in two, way up high. You'll come up to the 
creek where you should cross it and continue following the clear cut line. 
Finally you'll come to a paved path. Cross bridge 31. Over the bridge turn 
left onto a dirt path leading north along the creek again. You'll come to a 
tall rotting tree stump. Walk around it in a U-turn and follow the fallen tree 
about 15 paces to the Christmas Tree Graveyard.</p></div></body></html>
