I want to propose a new letterbox type:  Octopus Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox type has two characteristics.<br/>
  1. The area in which the letterbox is located is defined.<br/>
  2. The internet clues do not lead you directly to the letterbox, <br/>
but instead, refer to the area where the letterbox is located.<br/>
<br/>
Think of an Octopus, spreading it's arms through the entire area.  In <br/>
a large area, clues may be planted in varous locations, which will <br/>
slowly reveal the location of the letterbox.  Hints on the Lb website <br/>
may reveal clue locations.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is ideal for very small parks and areas.  In a small <br/>
park the description might read:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Name of Letterbox" e.g. Harry Potter #666<br/>
Located in Springfield Central Park<br/>
Clues: Check every hollow tree for clues<br/>
<br/>
or, another example:<br/>
Location: xxx Town Common<br/>
Letterbox planted in the best letterbox location in the common!<br/>
<br/>
For a larger park, you could provide internet clues to letterboxes or <br/>
clue locations on the ground.  For example the stanzas of a poem <br/>
might hint at locations.  In larger parks an Octopus placement could <br/>
take several visits to the park.  <br/>
<br/>
I am planning an "Octopus" placement for a small park within walking <br/>
distance of my home.  A poem will give tell what to look for (for <br/>
example, the largest erratic in the park), to find the letterbox <br/>
area.  This park only had four good letterbox locations, so I used <br/>
them all.  Two for letterboxes, and two for clues (which will make <br/>
finding the main letterbox pretty easy).  This type of Octopus <br/>
placement lends itself to the following game:  Pretend you are <br/>
placing a letterbox in this park, and locate the four best letterbox <br/>
locations: you will find my letterbox, and all it's clues.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Massachusetts, which has a lot of erratics (huge boulders) <br/>
and stone walls (walls can be a problem for an Octopus placement, but <br/>
easy to solve).  In this area letterbox locations can be <br/>
very "defined".  This technique might not work as well in featureless <br/>
terrain.  Can this method be used all over the country?<br/>
<br/>
Now for feedback<br/>
Has this type of Letterbox already been named?<br/>
Are a lot of these in use already?<br/>
<br/>
In general, what do you think of this idea?<br/>
<br/>

One problem I can see with this type of hide is the potential for<br/>
environmental damage. As you noted in your post, a careless hunter<br/>
could wreak havoc on a stone wall. The Murder boxes are in an area<br/>
that is not at all environmentally sensitive, so it doesn't present<br/>
too much opportunity for damage but in some areas it could be a real<br/>
disaster.<br/>
<br/>
If done carefully, and every finder is eco-friendly then it can work<br/>
but I prefer to have my clues take the finder to the immediate area of<br/>
the box. I like the clue to be nebulous but once at the site, the<br/>
hiding spot fairly straightforward. Funhog<br/>

That's what I was thinking too.  I'm sure you've thought about making sure<br/>
the container is clearly marked as a letterbox/octopus.  I would<br/>
reconsider writing something like "...turn over EVERY stone" in a<br/>
environmentally sensitive area.  This type of box may require more<br/>
maintenance on your part, especially if you have multiple clues to the<br/>
final prize.  But, hey, sounds like a fun idea.  Good luck.<br/>

&gt; I want to propose a new letterbox type:  Octopus Letterbox<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This letterbox type has two characteristics.<br/>
&gt;   1. The area in which the letterbox is located is defined.<br/>
&gt;   2. The internet clues do not lead you directly to the letterbox, <br/>
&gt; but instead, refer to the area where the letterbox is located.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Think of an Octopus, spreading it's arms through the entire area.  In <br/>
&gt; a large area, clues may be planted in varous locations, which will <br/>
&gt; slowly reveal the location of the letterbox.  Hints on the Lb website <br/>
&gt; may reveal clue locations.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Well, taking a page from geocaching, there are several similiar types <br/>
of GC you can use as an inspiration:<br/>
<br/>
off-set cache.  With this type, the coordinates (clues in the terms of <br/>
LBing) get you to a location.  (usually a plaque or similiar type <br/>
thing).  Information at that location will give you the information for <br/>
the actual GC.  (i've seen things like find a plaque, figure out a <br/>
certain year, subtrack that year from a given number to find the final <br/>
clue.  Another has you go to a location, figure out the color of part <br/>
of an outdoor sculpture.  Depending on which color, add/subtract from <br/>
the coordinates.)<br/>
<br/>
Multi-cache.  Here you have a series of GCs.  First one gives you the <br/>
coordinates to the next one, which leads to the next one and so on <br/>
until you have the final location.  Now, some multi-caches can be more <br/>
complex, in which each cache doesn't just give you the coordinates for <br/>
the next one, but instead gives you a puzzle or challenge you must <br/>
figure out to obtain the coordinates for the next location.<br/>
<br/>
"Series multi-caches". (don't know if there is a formal name for <br/>
this.)   I've seen a few of these.  You have a series of independent <br/>
GC, the information from all of them is needed to find the final, <br/>
secret cache.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

I'll ever go to Portland, and it does look like fun. Ryan gives two <br/>
clues for six boxes, so you would have to find the other boxes based on <br/>
clues in the first. This fits the definition of Bonus Boxes, right? The <br/>
tricky part is that if you can't find one of the early boxes, you won't <br/>
find the others. Resulting in a hung jury, the suspect being set free, <br/>
and the detective-in-charge centured.<br/>
<br/>
My take on the Octopus concept is that the clues are more parallel than <br/>
serial?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Have a look at Ryan's Murder in Gabriel Park in Portland, OR.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maiden1974 also has a series that are along these lines. Although<br/>
&gt; &gt; there are no hidden clues, only letterboxes, the concept is pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; much the same. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually, there are "clues" in some of the letterboxes to help people<br/>
&gt; find some of the other letterboxes. =) I just love that little series.<br/>
&gt; I kind of hoped more people would hide more series like that, but<br/>
&gt; nobody has bitten on it yet that I know about.<br/>
