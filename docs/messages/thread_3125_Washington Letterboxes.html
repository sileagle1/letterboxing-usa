<br/>
John and I headed up to Washington yesterday for an exciting day of<br/>
letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
First we hit Flaming Geyser, placed by Amanda in Seattle.  If you're<br/>
going for the excitement of Flaming Geyser, turn a burner on your gas<br/>
stove and see the sights!  WHOOPPEE!  I don't know if the park personnel<br/>
would be too thrilled but my first thought upon finding this geyser was<br/>
"where's a stick and a package of hot dogs when you need 'em?"  As for<br/>
Bubbling Geyser, my boyfriend thinks tootin' in the tub is more<br/>
impressive.  However, that said, you won't get disappointed thinking<br/>
you're headed for a mini Yellowstone or anything and the picnic area and<br/>
river are very nice.  <br/>
<br/>
Amanda placed a great letterbox with excellent clues at this very<br/>
popular state park and we're glad we went.  I like the stamp very much<br/>
and was very pleased it wasn't a real brain bender nor an excessively<br/>
long hike by any stretch.  Thanks, Amanda for a nice add to our "F"<br/>
count!<br/>
<br/>
After that we went up to Snoqualmie Falls to find Mischief's fine<br/>
series.  Indeed, folks, THIS IS A LETTERBOX SERIES NOT TO BE MISSED!!!<br/>
Excellent clues, great views and beautiful stamped images can all be<br/>
yours if you make the trip to this spot. Not only that, but Elvis came<br/>
back from the dead to seek out this series in late July.  The proof is<br/>
in the logbooks! We were very impressed and loved the hike and the<br/>
Falls.  Mischief's boxes were fully equipped with stamps, pads and<br/>
postcards.  Her signature stamp is delightful.  What a great day!<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd share.  Get ye all to Washington to enjoy these<br/>
people's boxes.  You won't be sorry you went.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

for sure it is not Yellowstone!!!-   And I must admit, I don't get <br/>
the Bubbling geyser?  What was that about?  It looks like grey water <br/>
to me.  I never saw any bubbles.<br/>
