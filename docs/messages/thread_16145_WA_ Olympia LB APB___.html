&gt; Any Olympia, WA area letterboxers--<br/>

&gt; Has anyone found the Yashiro Pagoda letterbox lately?  We went to <br/>
&gt; check on it today and it was missing (although it was very much <br/>
&gt; alive and well a few weeks ago with many, many visitors).  I <br/>
&gt; remember a handful of entries into the logbook over the last <br/>
couple <br/>
&gt; of months saying that it was wet--I'm hoping and praying that some <br/>
&gt; nice letterboxer took it home with them to air it out for a bit <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; will return it soon. <br/>

&gt; PS We found the world's smallest geocache in this park, too. Who <br/>
&gt; knew???<br/>
