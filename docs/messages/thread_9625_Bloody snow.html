were evenly spaced, it could be the cause. Hopefully, that's all the blood<br/>
was :-) I'm always sure to watch the trails behind my guys for signs of<br/>
blood when we go out in the snow/ice, since they only know the speed: Hyper<br/>
drive :-).<br/>

Subject: Boxing in the snow-Roosevelt Island<br/>
<br/>
Well we decided to try for it, but the snow defeated us.  I guess we<br/>
shouldn't have tried for one that specified 'vague' trail.  That<br/>
vague trail was nowhere to be found covered by snow.  But we had a<br/>
great walk on Roosevelt Island with our dog and enjoyed the scenery.<br/>
The only kinda creepy part was that on the way off the island we saw<br/>
bits of blood spattered snow and we followed the drops off blood all<br/>
the way back to the parking lot.  Probably just someone with a<br/>
nosebleed or something, but following a blood trail in the wee hours<br/>
of the morning on a fairly deserted island had a very surreal quality<br/>
about it!!<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to go back when the snow melts and we can find the trail<br/>
this time!<br/>
