<p>Kenneydell Park</p></b>
<p>Nearest Town: Olympia, WA <br/>County: Thurston<br/>Placed: 12/10/2<br/>Placed 
By: Fudrick <br/>Clues: Trivial <br/>Trek: Easy</p>
<p>Reminder: a great place for a picnic lunch.</p>
<p>Kenneydell Park - a former Girl Scout facility, now a Thurston County Park. 
41-acres with 1,000 feet of freshwater waterfront and a developed swim 
area/beach on Black Lake. The two covered shelters at Kenneydell Park offer a 
barbecue grill and three (3) picnic tables each with a seating capacity of 24-30 
people The Lodge at Kenneydell Park has a capacity of 49 people.</p><b></b>
<p>.Kenneydell Park is a Pet Control &amp; License Zone. No fishing, please. No 
animals or alcohol are permitted on the beach. Even so, it is a nice little 
park.</p><b>
</b><p>Directions to park: Take Highway 101 off I-5. Exit onto Black Lake 
Boulevard southbound. Proceed approximately 2 miles, then turn left onto the 
Black Lake-Belmore Road. Follow the Black Lake-Belmore Road approximately 2 
miles. Turn right onto 66th. At the sharp curve to the left, 66th will become 
known as Fairview Road. Kenneydell County Park entrance is 600 feet after the 
curve on the right. Park in the lot.</p><b>
</b><p>CLUES: Go look in the window of the Lodge. Nice place for a gathering. 
Head southerly to the grassy area. Spot the Pioneer Shelter? Just to the left of 
the fine shelter you see a trail heading for the lake. A tee in the trail, lets 
go to the left. You see a fence with a locked gate ahead, that is probably not 
the way to go, although the fence is short, you could go around either end. 
Fortunately there is a trail on this side heading off to the lake. Eventually 
you will come to two trees very close together at the base. Just before the twin 
trees is a trail. Between the trail and the trees are two stumps. Kenney is in 
the shorter of the two. Please replace well. Continuing on toward the lake, you 
enter the beach and swimming area. The sign indicates the beach is named after a 
noted pioneer family, Sam and Mable Unattended. After enjoying your swim, head 
up the paved trail. Just beyond the restroom, you spy a trail to the right. You 
come to a four-way intersection. Lets go to the left. You find the Ridge 
Shelter, too busy to hide anything here. Head back to the four-way. Head to the 
left. As you go up the hill, you see a stump on your left. Dell is at the base, 
away from the lake. Again, please hide well. Continue on to the Pioneer Shelter, 
or back to the Ridge Shelter, wherever you prefer for your picnic.</p><i>
