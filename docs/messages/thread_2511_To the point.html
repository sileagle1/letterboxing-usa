&gt;     in my opinion, you just chose to dredge up some stuff after<br/>
&gt;suggesting that moving forward was a good idea.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please desist, I don't have any more energy for this topic.<br/>

I am quite sure you would like to avoid "stuff" coming to light about <br/>
behind the scenes behavior that has resulted in both Randy Hall and <br/>
John DeWolf withdrawing from LBNA activity due to the way they have <br/>
been treated. I am also sure you would like to completely ignore the <br/>
inconsistencies between your current positions and the flack that I <br/>
received previously for suggesting similar things (or did I misread <br/>
that T-shirts may appear soon?). Sweep it all under the rug, since <br/>
life has been made so miserable for anyone with opposing views that <br/>
they have either left or shut up.  Am I exaggerating or perhaps <br/>
outright lying? Open the archives and it would be answered.<br/>
<br/>
My core issue is that I can not stand hypocrisy.<br/>
<br/>
For those who may be new to the hobby. Of all people involved in <br/>
letterboxing from the beginning I have the greatest respect for Randy <br/>
Hall. We have often strongly disagreed on things, but he has always <br/>
conducted himself in the most respectful and intelligent manner. I am <br/>
used to flack because I voice my opinions openly and don't try to <br/>
hide my views. I am upset about the way Randy and John have been <br/>
treated behind the cloak of webmaster secrecy.<br/>
<br/>
If you like the name Letterboxing North America<br/>
Thank Randy Hall<br/>
<br/>
If you like the fact that the domain name letterboxing.org was obtained<br/>
Thank Randy Hall<br/>
<br/>
If you like the fact that this list is available for your clues and <br/>
experiences.<br/>
Thank Randy Hall and John DeWolf for running it.<br/>
<br/>
If you can't stand that people such as myself have the nerve to upset <br/>
the boat and talk about issues important to the history and future of <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
Blame Randy and John for not kicking me off yet ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If you like the fact that Randy and John are so burned out they have <br/>
withdrawn from any involvement in the LbNA site.<br/>
Thank 3 of the webmasters who I'll avoid naming for the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Some final notes. Neither Randy nor John has put me up to any of <br/>
this. I take all the blame for daring to air such information <br/>
publicly. I realize there is no chance my offer to provide free <br/>
hosting for the site would ever be accepted by the current powers <br/>
that be, and that is just as well. I would only offer it again if <br/>
there were significant changes in the way things worked including <br/>
opening all webmaster debate to the community members view and a <br/>
pledge to avoid things such as locking out people with whom you <br/>
disagree.<br/>
<br/>

Yeah, I'm wonderful. :-)<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I was not trying to dredge up the past negatives,<br/>
but a past positive.  Quick archive diving will reveal many positive<br/>
respones to the offer on the list (either its first or second <br/>
incarnation).  There are some individuals opposed to it, that is life.  <br/>
I knew that, but if T-shirt sales were being considered, once a taboo<br/>
subject, then it seemed possible that other past taboos may be also <br/>
relegated to the dustbin.  I must repond, at least to that.<br/>
<br/>
The financial problems came to light recently, as did the "K" post,<br/>
so it seemed germaine.  I did not write the "K" post.<br/>
<br/>
Lets kill it for everyone's sake, though, the issue seems intractable.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for my part.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
