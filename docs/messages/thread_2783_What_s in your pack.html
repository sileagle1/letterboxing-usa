<div>I was interested to see this post--I had the same 
feeling today as I hunted in a deeply wooded, somewhat isolated area. I was a 
woman alone and a man came onto the trail where I had stopped to check my clues. 
He was just hiking, too, but it gave me pause. Besides, I could have used the 
pepper spray on the bugs! Good suggestion and it never hurts to be prepared.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would also suggest that anyone who plans to hike off well marked <br/>
trails consider a basic gps device. They are not necessary for many <br/>
types of hiking but can save you a lot of grief if you get lost off a <br/>
trail system. One of the best features that they have is <br/>
automatically tracking your wanderings so you can easily go back the <br/>
way you came. I have always carried a compass, but one reason I <br/>
recently got a gps was the amount of time (and sweat) it took me to <br/>
get "unlost" in  forest and make it back to my vehicle. Basic ones <br/>
(e.g. Garmin etrex or Magellan 315) are just over a hundred dollars <br/>
and worth every cent if you are lost off a trail system.<br/>
