<br/>
Somewhere off Route 563 by mile marker #30 is the famous Batona Trail.<br/>
 Park by the Batona Trail sign.  From the sign proceed at 120 degrees<br/>
on foot taking the Batona Trail.  The Batona Trail is clearly marked<br/>
with pink blazes.  For this hunt you will have to walk approximately<br/>
0.35 miles.  This is often called the Evans Bridge portion of the<br/>
trail.  For the walking portion of this hunt in the warmer months, you<br/>
will need bug repellant .  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your views of the low-lying swamp areas and ponds as you hike<br/>
the Batona, which literally means BA(back) TO(to) NA(nature).  WATCH<br/>
for King snakes, gardener snakes and pine snakes on this trail. <br/>
Haven't seen a rattlesnake yet, but take caution.  Be careful of wild<br/>
animals.  <br/>
<br/>
You will cross a fallen tree in the path and a bridge ahead of that. <br/>
Now you are getting close.  Keep alert where the path "Y's" off.  At<br/>
the "Y" take the trail at 180 degrees (you are getting off the Batona<br/>
Trail here).  25 paces to the big pine tree shaped like a "Y".  From<br/>
there, take 20 paces at 150 degrees to the fallen pine tree.  From<br/>
there walk 4 paces at 285 degrees and look at the base of the tree. <br/>
You will find what you came for.  Thank you for stamping in.  Please<br/>
return it to it's proper resting spot and please cover well.  Thank you.  <br/>
<br/>
Always proceed at your discretion.  The owner of this letterbox<br/>
assumes no responsibility for your actions or any occurrence to you or<br/>
your company on this hunt.  Please remember you are in a state forest.<br/>
 Remember pack in pack out your trash and only you can prevent forest<br/>
fires.  Treat this forest as if it were your home.  Tread lightly.  <br/>
