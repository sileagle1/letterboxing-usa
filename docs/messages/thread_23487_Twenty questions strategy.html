"The game suggests that the information (as measured by Shannon<br/>

<http: en.wikipedia.org="" information_entropy="" wiki="">  statistic) required to<br/>
identify an arbitrary object is about 20 bits<br/>
<http: bit="" en.wikipedia.org="" wiki=""> . The game is often used as an example<br/>
when teaching people about information theory<br/>
<http: en.wikipedia.org="" information_theory="" wiki=""> . Mathematically, if each<br/>
question is structured to eliminate half the objects, twenty questions will<br/>
allow the questioner to distinguish between 220 or 1,048,576 objects.<br/>
Accordingly, the most effective strategy for Twenty Questions is to ask<br/>
questions that will split the field of remaining possibilities roughly in<br/>
half each time. The process is analogous to a binary search algorithm<br/>

Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I have a theory. <br/>
<br/>
Right now we stand at 88 communities remaining. If we use the best approach  <br/>
as posted by Boston Rott (see below), after our next question (#11) we will be <br/>
 down to 44, then 22 (#12) and so on until question # 17 gets us to 1 <br/>
community.  This will leave us 3 questions to figure out which rock it is under. This <br/>
may be  all we need but for some reason, I don't think so.<br/>
<br/>
Now starting at question 17 and working our way back to where we are  today <br/>
and doubling it each time, we only need to be at 64 after the next  question to <br/>
still get down to 1 after 17 questions (see the following  chart).<br/>
<br/>
After Q 10 = 88<br/>
After Q 11 = 44 or   64<br/>
After Q 12 = 22 or   32 <br/>
After Q 13 = 11 or   16<br/>
After Q 14 = 6   or   8<br/>
After Q 15 = 3   or   4<br/>
After Q 16 = 2   or    2<br/>
After Q 17 = 1   or    1<br/>
<br/>
These numbers are worse case scenario. Now it is possible that we could get  <br/>
down to 1 after 16 questions if the Q 16 answer gets us to 1 instead of  2. <br/>
<br/>
If we ask a risky question at this point (one that will either eliminate 24  <br/>
or 64) and we fail and leave 64 left, we have only lost the opportunity to  <br/>
get down to 1 after Q 16 however, if we are correct, the rest of the process  <br/>
looks like this (worse case scenario):<br/>
<br/>
After Q 11 = 24<br/>
After Q 12 = 12<br/>
<br/>
After Q 13 = 6<br/>
After Q 14 = 3<br/>
After Q 15 = 2<br/>
After Q 16 = 1<br/>
<br/>
And if we are lucky on Q 15, we get to 1 community. We also get  to apply <br/>
this logic again and try to get down to 8 or 16 after Q 12. I  think this <br/>
increases our reward without a proportional increase in the  risk.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone see any errors in my math or fault to this logic? <br/>

point is extremely important.  I think you may be onto something.<br/>
<br/>
Now, looking really far into the question asking.... once we get the <br/>
town/city, how the heck are going to determine what trail, bench or fire <br/>
hydrant this box is located next to?  Will we be asking whether the box <br/>
is next the twelfth tree after the third rock on a particular trail?  <br/>
I'm sure there will have to be some sort of gimme when we get that close <br/>
or else it'll be one heck of a search party.  I can imagine lines of <br/>
people with sticks and possibly a dog trained to sniff out Mastercarve.<br/>
<br/>
Blax<br/>
<br/>
P.S. All I have to offer are two cats, but I don't think they like <br/>
Mastercarve too much.  Give 'em a moth and they're happy.<br/>
