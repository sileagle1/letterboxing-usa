<br/>
The polling is complete, and we now have a date set for our <br/>
gathering!  The 2004 Great Lakes Gathering will be on June 12, 2004.<br/>
<br/>
You can go to the "official" website at:<br/>
<br/>
http://home.wi.rr.com/dragonlber/GLG.htm<br/>
<br/>
Remember - if you want to make an event box, whether you'll be in <br/>
attendence or not, it can be based on any theme you wish.  We would <br/>
like to have a number of boxes based on the theme "Cooler by the <br/>
Lake", however.<br/>
<br/>
Any letterboxers from outside the Great Lakes region are encouraged <br/>
to come to our gathering as well!  We also encourage all <br/>
letterboxers to consider sending event boxes or travellers to our <br/>
gathering even if you cannot make it.<br/>
<br/>
Please email me to let me know whether you plan to attend and <br/>
whether you will help in any area noted on the website, or if you'll <br/>
be sending an event box/traveller.<br/>
<br/>
I should have a specific location picked early in Easter week.<br/>
