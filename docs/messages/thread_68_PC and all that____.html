of his friends has hidden a surprise for everyone.  He has his funny hat,<br/>
magnifying glass, and compass, but everyone knows women are better navigators<br/>
LOL so his gal pal Holly Hike carries the clues and reads them aloud.......<br/>
<br/>
Bobby and Betty Bee can fly ahead and watch for hidden dangers on the ground<br/>
like creeks and loose rocks................<br/>

boy girl boy girl.....<br/>

I'm just being silly but feel like a co-ed team will come in handy for the PC<br/>
folks (click on either one--they go together) and I do agree that the licensed<br/>
characters are just going to trip us up one day, so we probably should just<br/>
start fixing up our own set of drawings for the web page.  I can't draw (not<br/>
so's you'd notice, anyway) so I love having artists here with us<br/>
volunteering!!! <br/>
<br/>
Wish I had more to offer but I certainly do look forward to showing the<br/>
finished kids' pages to my boys.  We'll be taking them with us when we hide<br/>
our own boxes.<br/>
(some day)<br/>
