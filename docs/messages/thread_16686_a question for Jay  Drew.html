<br/>
I would have emailed you off list but I can't find your email <br/>
address :(  I am trying to finish all the Washington county (RI) <br/>
letterboxes and I noticed that your boxes there are not listed any <br/>
more.  I know that you have been updating and/or retiring some of <br/>
your older boxes.  If the clues are not longer on line does that mean <br/>
that the box is no longer there?  The boxes I need to do to complete <br/>
Washington county are:  Ninigret Pond - the box on East beach, <br/>
Canochet waters (I know that at least one the Canochet boxes is <br/>
missing), and Blurred Borders.  Can you give me the status of these <br/>
boxes please?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I still need to do breaking hearts at break heart.  I know this <br/>
is a very old box.  Have you heard the status of this box by any <br/>
chance?<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your help,<br/>
<br/>
Janet<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Janet! Hope you're enjoying this marvelous fall weather. All the <br/>
boxes you mention are older and poorly maintained. We have plans to <br/>
visit them and either spruce them up or retire them, but we've <br/>
temporarily taken them off the letterboxing.org site since we think <br/>
lots of letterboxers would be disappointed by them. They're semi-<br/>
retired until we can get the time to give them. For exact status you <br/>
can check our own website at<br/>

The Breaking Hearts at Breakheart box isn't one of ours, as I'm sure <br/>
you know. It is one of the oldest boxes in the country though, so it <br/>
deserves some TLC. We haven't checked on it in years, nor heard any <br/>
status reports on the big list. Last time we stopped in it was very <br/>
difficult to find: it is a long way off trail and the "landmarks" in <br/>
the clues, like the V-stick tree or whatever, are long gone with <br/>
changes in the forest. We'll check on it when we redo our Feathers in <br/>
your cap series which is close by, or if you go for it, maybe bring <br/>
complete fix-it supplies.<br/>
Thanks for asking! Jay in glorious autumned Connecticut<br/>
