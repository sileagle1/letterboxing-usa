<div>Tne Lakes of the Charles box is certainly a good 
suggestion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>would also suggest the "Heron of the Charles" 
letterbox, which is near Nonantum/Watertown Square.  There are a couple of 
letterboxes in Dover (Noanet Woodlands and Chase Woodlands) which are worth 
seeking out (though perhaps a longer hike than you are looking for).  The 
Birdhouse letterbox in Needham is also well worth seeking out.  There is at 
least one more box with a Mystery Clue that is within a half-hour of Wellesley 
Hills, but I won't name it, since I don't want to spoil the pleasure of the 
hunt!</div>
