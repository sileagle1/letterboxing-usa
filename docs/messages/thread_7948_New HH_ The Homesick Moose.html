<br/>
<br/>The Homesick Moose was released back into the wild on Sept. 24, 2002. He was originally intended to be planted in Maine, but things didn't quite work out as we planned. He really wants to get back home, and we hope all of you out there will help him get to Maine! If you find him, let us know!
<br/>
<br/>HINT: He started his journey home in one of the boxes that we've personally planted.
<br/>
<br/>BIG HINT: If your name is Irish Tinker, you can find out exactly which one he's in!

All! I am not giving up on my fight for a HH but I also don't want it handed to

&gt; I am also closing in on 100 F, I am starting to get very serious about the <br/>
&gt; fact that I think I should get a special patch if I reach 100 without <br/>
&gt; getting a HH! Hahaha!<br/>
<br/>
I have well over 100 finds without finding an HH, which is fine by me, as I<br/>
prefer boxes where puzzling out the clues is the challenge.  (Of course, I <br/>
hit 100 in 1999, before the HH was ubiquitous -- getting that far before <br/>
stumbling over one in this day and age does seem improbable, doesn't it :-))<br/>
<br/>
Well, I hope you find one soon, so I can continue with my (possible)<br/>
distinction of having the most HH-less finds :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
