updates to the Whats New page and the total lack of updates in <br/>
southern New England and our pages in the west (AZ in particular).<br/>
<br/>
We're having technical difficulties, and none of us are very tech <br/>
savvy. I'm hoping a computer overhaul by a generous friend this <br/>
weekend will solve the problem and get us back in business.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Jay, I for one appreciate all that you and the other Webmasters do to <br/>
keep the LBNA site up and running, and I totally understand that you <br/>
have other interests and activities in your lives besides letterboxing <br/>
and sitting at the computer, and that technical difficulties can and do <br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>
I think the ability of this new technology to make things happen fast <br/>
creates an unrealistic expectation that things OUGHT to happen fast.  <br/>
However, once a letterbox is hidden, it is (hopefully) going to be <br/>
there a long, long time, so where's the rush to get the clue online?  <br/>
The box isn't going anywhere!<br/>
<br/>
I can't be there for the NE gathering this coming weekend, but I hope <br/>
you all have a good time and great weather for letterboxing.<br/>
