is my favorite for ever and ever, but it warrents mention. <br/>
  Nature Conservancy Preserve:  Rock Spring Wildlife Refuge, <br/>
Scotland, CT.  The trails take you through such varied terrain, by a <br/>
river with beaver activity, by a natural spring whch bubbles up from <br/>
the sand, pine trees, deciduous trees, kettle holes, rocks and <br/>
ledges. (Plus, letterboxes!). I have hiked here in all seasons and <br/>
find the peacefulness renews my spirit.  <br/>
  There is a detailed trail guide available at the parking area, <br/>
unless they run out.  (I have a copy and would zerox to mail to you, <br/>
the requester of info.if you wish). For general info, The book, <br/>
Country Walks in CT a guide to Nature Conservancy Preserves by Susan <br/>
D. Cooley [ISBN 0-910146-78-0] is published by Apalachian Mt. Club <br/>
books and is an excellent reference to lots of incredible places to <br/>
get away from the grind. <br/>
