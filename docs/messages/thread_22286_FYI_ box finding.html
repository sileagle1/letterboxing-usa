                    <div class="plaintext-content">Howdy folks, as this pertains to more than just myself and/or boxes<br/>
that are in Maine, I thought I'd share this thought with a larger<br/>
audience than our usual regional talk list operatives.<br/>
<br/>
It has been brought to my attention that some of my boxes are in<br/>
questionable locales. Now, this is not all of my boxes, and not<br/>
necessarily in Maine, this is not specifically targeted at anyone or<br/>
anything recent regarding emails - so DON'T FLAME ME...ahem, moving<br/>
on. These are observations that I've made based on placing a small<br/>
quantity of boxes in new england.<br/>
<br/>
When you're handed a set of clues that are not for mass consumption,<br/>
aka - not posted on the internet database - clue listing - in other words <br/>
w o r d  o f  m o u t h ..... h a n d c r a f t e d with CARE...that<br/>
means that I think highly enough of your lowly existence to have<br/>
bothered handing these clues out.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a problem with the location, please of course - always<br/>
question the placer, you might not agree with the logic or lack<br/>
thereof behind the location or placement, however, the person placing<br/>
boxes for you special little finders to buldoze, has taken great<br/>
lengths to hand craft stamps and boxes just so you can enjoy them.<br/>
<br/>
This leads me to my next point. If there is a disclaimer on the clues,<br/>
then make sure you follow it carefully. Most likely, if these are<br/>
"urban" boxes, then you're going to need to be stealthy and watch your<br/>
back. If these are in the middle of the woods, well you better pack<br/>
yer bug juice and tick tweezers and perhaps some extra water and<br/>
yadaydada. But, if the placer doesn't take responsibility for warning<br/>
you - then whose reaponsibility is it to know what they are doing?<br/>
Where they are searching? And....most of all, what the clues say? <br/>
<br/>
Yup, that's right folks - it's the FINERS.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to an age old topic of dicsussion. The planter places<br/>
boxes with a particular audience and intent in mind, and the finder<br/>
takes full responsibility for deciding which boxes to find and in<br/>
which areas. If it's in an urban area and looks sketchy, then by all<br/>
means, drag your 3.5 younglings through the garbage heaps and trash<br/>
pick like the bums, it's only the smart thing to do. But, if the<br/>
placer has put these clues in your hands, then it's your<br/>
responsibility to find or not to find.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody said you had to bother finding a box, even if it's a great<br/>
hand-carved stamp by phyto - who cares - you may absolutely despise<br/>
the thought of blood-thirsty mosquitoes, then you'd better be warned,<br/>
it's not going to be pretty.<br/>

after one-too-many Contact the Placer email complaining about Poison <br/>
Ivy (can you imagine, Poison Ivy!  In the woods!  Who could have <br/>
imagined that it might be there?!).  <br/>
<br/>
The general consensus was that it was up to the FINDERS to assume <br/>
some responsibility for things like:  PI, ants, mosquitos, hills, <br/>
sand traps, weeds, bunkers, water and mud, etc.  Unusual and <br/>
unexpected hazards like sheer drop-offs over cliffs or things of <br/>
that nature should probably be noted in the clues.  If Lucy would <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We recently had a similar discussion in Texas.  We<br/>
felt the need to create a legal document that needs to<br/>
be signed, notarized, and placed on file with the<br/>
placers of any prospective box on a finder's list. <br/>
Here is the result of our labor:<br/>
<br/>
"Letterboxing must be considered a high-risk activity<br/>
and as such, the following warnings are provided in an<br/>
effort to alleviate liability of the placer:<br/>
<br/>
1) Animals, plants, trees, insects, or spiders may be<br/>
found in the general area of the box.  Any of these<br/>
could present possible harm individually or severally<br/>
and are often found in combination with one another.  <br/>
<br/>
2) Tripping hazards include holes, roots, and vines,<br/>
as well as detached limbs and branches cast aside by<br/>
above-mentioned trees.  These hazards are often found<br/>
in and around box areas.<br/>
<br/>
3) While every attempt is made to place a box in an<br/>
area with excellent air quality, the possible risk of<br/>
air pollutants is present.  <br/>
<br/>
4) Water hazards ranging from small puddles to oceans,<br/>
and even water droplets in liquid or frozen form<br/>
falling from the sky may be found unexpectedly and<br/>
without warning.  An additional water hazard is found<br/>
during times of extreme heat and forms within the<br/>
body, forcing it's way out through pourous skin.<br/>
<br/>
5) Beignet-eating aliens can often be found in areas<br/>
with high letterbox concentrations.  Under no<br/>
circumstance should finders attempt to make contact<br/>
with such aliens while in possession of a letterbox;<br/>
however, if approached by BEA's, surrender any and all<br/>
boxes and stamps, as well as all bread products.<br/>
<br/>
6) The placer has made every effort to eradicate<br/>
hazardous micro-organisms in the vicinity of the box,<br/>
but such organisms may have found their way back into<br/>
the area between monthly sweeps, so the potential<br/>
finder must exercise appropriate caution.  <br/>
<br/>
7) In addition to the above mentioned dangers, there<br/>
may be other individuals found on the trail who must<br/>
be misled and/or misguided, so any finder with an<br/>
aversion to executing subterfuge is cautioned and<br/>
should plan to box during off-peak hours.  <br/>
<br/>
8) Intense exposure to sunlight has been known to<br/>
cause cancer, so finders must take proper precautions<br/>
to avoid excessive exposure.<br/>
<br/>
9) While letterboxing after daylight hours may<br/>
alleviate some of the above-mentioned hazards<br/>
(specifically #7 &amp; #8), please be aware that it<br/>
increases some of the other risks (#1, #2, &amp; #5).<br/>
<br/>
9) Finally, loss of direction is a constant risk so<br/>
every effort should be made to maintain a means of<br/>
communication and backtracking.  Cell phones and<br/>
compasses are highly recommended, as are homing<br/>
pigeons.  Leaving a trail of bread crumbs, while<br/>
effective, can be hampered by hazards previously<br/>
mentioned, specifically #1, #5, and #7, as well <br/>
as by the homing pigeons.<br/>
<br/>
Placer shall only be responsible for the failure of<br/>
the finder to secure the stamp image and shall not in<br/>
any way be liable for monetary, emotional, or other<br/>
damages incurred by finders while letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
In the event legal action is required, every effort<br/>
must first be made to resolve differences through<br/>
mediation.  If court action is required, please file<br/>
necessary paperwork no later than January 31st for<br/>
consideration at the annual meeting of the<br/>
letterboxing court, held at a predetermined location,<br/>
usually in the month of March.  At that time, evidence<br/>
will be heard and a determination will be made.  If<br/>
unsuccessful in his/her defense, the placer will be <br/>
ordered to provide a stamp image of the box in<br/>
question.<br/>
<br/>
If cause is found to be unsubstantiated, the finder<br/>
will be ordered to place no less than three boxes of<br/>
their own, each one of which much be in a county with<br/>
5 or fewer boxes."<br/>

<br/>
Now then;<br/>
<br/>
Her Ladyship, while she would never be considered an old-timer in<br/>
letterboxing or otherwise, longs for the days when most everything<br/>
about letterboxing was surreptitious. I can't agree more with you,<br/>
dear Phyto. When her Ladyship was introduced to the activity it was<br/>
assumed that all activity and actions were to be discreet and<br/>
clandestine. Then suddenly articles are being published in major<br/>
magazines and newspapers from Podunk to Poughkeepsie and we have<br/>
people demanding that clues be easier, boxes be easy to find and in<br/>
open easily accessible areas. People are going out in large noisy<br/>
packs and walking up to NPS rangers and demanding that they show them<br/>
where the box is. Corporations are placing boxes in their attempt to<br/>
have advertising in every possible square inch of real estate in the<br/>
nation. Gone are the glory days! Of course people are going to go<br/>
underground and plant in "questionable areas" because the public<br/>
landscape is lousy with Tupperware and their "public" boxes are<br/>
repeatedly mishandled. The secretive nature of this hobby seems to<br/>
have been lost, seemingly due to demanding, lazy boxers who just don't<br/>
get it, or, like so much of our society want every step they take and<br/>
every breath they draw to be totally risk free. The sort that take no<br/>
personal responsibility for anything that happens to them or because<br/>
of them. The sort that think that their entire lack of common sense or<br/>
even the tiny amount of brain power needed to negotiate a world full<br/>
of hazard should be mitigated by everyone else in the world. The sort<br/>
that will sue the pants off of someone because they spilled their hot<br/>
coffee or ate a cheeseburger. Sure there were people like that from<br/>
the beginning but because there were far fewer boxers there was a much<br/>
smaller number but since the number of boxers has increased<br/>
exponentially the number of those types has increased to a rather<br/>
annoying level. How many of us have gotten messages that our box was<br/>
too hard to find (duh, that's the point) or the clues too hard to<br/>
solve (hello, wake up and smell the coffee) or the hike too far (I've<br/>
been told "it's about the hike") Now we have to warn everybody about<br/>
every potential hazard and instruct them to be respectful of the<br/>
environment and rehide as it was found and be careful in high traffic<br/>
areas and leave not trace; all things that seemed to be understood in<br/>
the past.  I can sympathize and if people want access to great boxes<br/>
like those created by great carvers like Phyto that are word of mouth<br/>
only they're going to have to show some respect and common sense<br/>
because the current box mortality rate is terribly frustrating.<br/>
