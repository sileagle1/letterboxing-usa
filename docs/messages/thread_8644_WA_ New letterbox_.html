at Dog Mountain.  (That's in the Columbia River Gorge, for those <br/>
not in the know.)<br/>
<br/>
Web masters:<br/>
<br/>
The link to the African Safari Series already exists on the website <br/>
(under Washington then Southwest Washington).   But can you <br/>
update the number of boxes to "4 of 12" and the URL to point to <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/OR/AfricanSafari<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  The numbers are a little out of date, so there's actually <br/>
12 in the series, four of which are actually in the state of <br/>
Washington.<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of Dog Mountain, I also nabbed Funhog's box <br/>
while I was up there, which is alive and well and VERY <br/>
neglected.  Not a single visitor but me!  Shame, shame....  <br/>
*shaking head*  Beautiful stamp too boot!  =)<br/>

You went above and beyond the call of duty in creating your <br/>
masterpiece of an event stamp for today's S. Sound LB Quest Fest <br/>
event!!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!<br/>
<br/>
What an incredible work of art and to think you did it twice is <br/>
mindboggling!  ;)  I definitely don't have that kind of patience.<br/>
<br/>
It was great meeting you and all the others today and I look forward <br/>
to eventually finding more of your and the others' boxes in the <br/>
future.  But first, I need a nap...  ;)<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail(s) and at future LB events...<br/>
