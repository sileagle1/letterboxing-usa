<br/>
Northside Park<br/>
Vienna, Virginia <br/>
Fairfax County <br/>
Placed by Daughter of the Old Dominion<br/>
November 2, 2002<br/>
<br/>
This is an undeveloped park with trails, no restrooms, and no picnic <br/>
tables that I've been able to find.  Dogs on leash OK.<br/>
<br/>
You should be able to find all the boxes in under 2 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Park:<br/>
<br/>
You need to get on Route 123 (Maple Avenue) which is the main street<br/>
through Vienna.  You can get there from the Beltway (Route 495) or <br/>
from the other direction from Route 66.  Once on Maple Avenue, turn <br/>
north on Glyndon Street, between the Mobil Station and the Shell <br/>
Station.  Pass Glyndon Park and drive to the end of Glyndon Street, <br/>
past the No Outlet sign. There is a small gravel parking area and a <br/>
sign for Richard S. Black Trail.<br/>
<br/>
Clues to Boxes:<br/>
<br/>
A bunch of Dead Authors were sitting about God's Country one day <br/>
talking about their earthly days.  Mark Twain said he sure missed the<br/>
Mississippi River and wanted to see it again.  "I think I can hear it<br/>
now." (Being dead, he had lost track of geography.)  He jumped up and<br/>
started walking up the trail.  The rest of the group followed him, <br/>
with Lewis and Clark bringing up the rear.  Although Lewis and Clark <br/>
weren't authors themselves, they liked to hang around with the <br/>
literati (we don't know why), and they always carried a compass.<br/>
<br/>
"280 degrees" said Lewis.  But nobody paid attention.<br/>
<br/>
Near the top of the hill they reached a wide path.  "Let's go this <br/>
way" said Mark Twain, and everyone turned. "240 degrees" said Clark.  <br/>
But nobody paid attention.<br/>
<br/>
They hadn't gone but 15 steps when Louisa May Alcott spoke <br/>
up.  "Gentlemen, I cannot take another step in these slippers.  I <br/>
fear I will have to sit and wait your return."  Everyone looked <br/>
around but there was no chair or bench in sight.  Directly to their <br/>
right they spied a tree stump, just about rump high.  All the men <br/>
produced clean handkerchiefs from their pockets and spread them on <br/>
the stump.  Miss Alcott sat, pronounced herself comfortable, and sent <br/>
the group on its way.<br/>
<br/>
Box 1.  Louisa May Alcott's Box<br/>
As Louisa May sat and waited, she thought about the treasures she had<br/>
brought into the world.  To find Louisa's treasure, continue on the <br/>
path for 40 steps.  Two lone trees should be on your left.  Standing <br/>
on the path, looking between these trees into the woods, you will see <br/>
a decayed stump.  (If Lewis or Clark had been here they would have <br/>
told you to look 210 degrees)  Beneath the stump, covered by a piece <br/>
of log is Louisa's treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the group had reached a T in the path.  "Let's go this <br/>
way," said Mark Twain and off they all went.  "208 degrees" said <br/>
Lewis, but nobody paid attention.<br/>
<br/>
When they reached the bottom of the hill, the group turned toward the<br/>
sound of water.  "120 degrees" said Clark, who by this point, was<br/>
talking only to Lewis.  The group walked until they saw a bridge.  <br/>
Mark Twain was already standing on the bridge.  He surveyed the water <br/>
and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his<br/>
spirit.  This could not be the monstrous big river he remembered.  But<br/>
it still looked like a fun place for boys to have adventures and to <br/>
find treasures.<br/>
<br/>
Box 2.  Mark Twain's Box.<br/>
To find Mark Twain's treasure, from the bridge return down the paved <br/>
path. Stop at the end of the black railing.  Walk straight up the <br/>
hill to the widest tree (it is obviously the widest tree); it is <br/>
almost a double trunk tree but the fork starts too high up to be one <br/>
of your regular double trunks.  Still facing uphill, look to the <br/>
right for a decayed fallen tree that looks like it has fallen over <br/>
decayed logs.  Where they cross, on the downhill side, under the tree <br/>
portion, is Mark Twain's treasure.   <br/>
<br/>
After playing on the hill and tossing rocks into the creek, the group <br/>
decided to move on.  They retraced their steps on the trail up the <br/>
hill.  They were so engrossed in their conversation, they completely <br/>
missed the turn that would have taken them back to Miss Alcott.<br/>
<br/>
"We turn here" said Lewis and Clark in unison.  But nobody paid<br/>
attention; they just kept walking straight.  Either Lewis or Clark <br/>
could have told them they were walking north, but who would have <br/>
listened?<br/>
<br/>
The wide path turned, but our adverturers wanted to explore the <br/>
narrower path.  "280 degrees" said Lewis.  But no one heard because <br/>
they had already gone ahead and were debating which direction to take <br/>
at the fork.  "Let's go this way" said Washington Irving - which <br/>
turned out to be 310 degrees, as verified by Clark. This was probably <br/>
a bad choice because the descent was a little steep at the end and <br/>
would be muddy after a rain.<br/>
<br/>
They all made it safely to the bottom of the hill.  Across the small <br/>
clearing they saw a bridge and, of course, crossed it. Here the path <br/>
split.  They went single file down the grass path through the <br/>
brush. "North," said Clark.  But no one listened.  The narrow path <br/>
followed the creek downstream and widened after the brush.  The group <br/>
continued following the path downstream.  After a short while they <br/>
T'd into a wider path.  Directly to the right, there was a fallen <br/>
tree touching, but not crossing the path.  <br/>
<br/>
It was here that Washington Irving said "I've had enough walking.  I'm<br/>
just tired through and through.  This puts me in mind of someone I <br/>
once knew who slept in the woods.  I think I'm ready for a nap <br/>
myself." <br/>
<br/>
Box 3.  Washington Irving's Box<br/>
To find Washington Irving's napping place, follow the fallen tree up <br/>
the hill. Continue in the same direction -- 230 degrees, if you were <br/>
to listen to Lewis -- until you reach another fallen tree that is <br/>
perpendicular to your uphill direction.  The trunk is too wide here <br/>
to use as a headrest so go towards the narrow end of the trunk. When <br/>
it is sufficiently narrow, look behind the log.  Snuggled under it <br/>
beneath a blanket of leaves and sticks is Washington Irving's Box. <br/>
<br/>
Nobody else wanted to sleep outside but they were getting pretty tired<br/>
of all the walking.  James Fenimore Cooper was still thinking about <br/>
the rocks he noticed on their hike to Washington Irving's Box.  The <br/>
rocks are grey and some are lichen covered.  Cooper thought, "If I <br/>
were a person who needed to hide,this would be a good spot." (Being <br/>
dead, he had lost all sense of proportion.  Anyone else would think <br/>
it was a bad place to hide because the rocks are only about ankle <br/>
high.)<br/>
<br/>
Box 4.  James Fenimore Cooper's Box<br/>
To find Cooper's hiding place, start walking back to the wooden <br/>
bridge.  LOOK CAREFULLY.  You will pass a small holly on the right <br/>
(about 3 feet tall in November 2002).  You will come upon a second <br/>
slightly taller holly (about 5 feet tall in November 2002). If you <br/>
reach the brush area, you've gone too far. About 10 feet away at an <br/>
uphill angle from the second holly is a small pine (3 feet tall in <br/>
November 2002) and directly between these two evergreens is a tree <br/>
that has a thin hairy vine on the creek side.  Stand on the uphill <br/>
side with your back to the tree.  On a bearing of 210 degrees take 5 <br/>
steps.  Cooper's Box is behind a rock and beneath a rock.<br/>
<br/>
Back on the path.  After recrossing the bridge, no one wanted to <br/>
climb up the hill so they decided to take the easier path around the <br/>
hill.  "50 degrees," said Clark to no one in particular.  Right past <br/>
the juncture with another path, the group saw a tree that had fallen <br/>
across the creek.  "Aha, look at this bridge to that island over <br/>
there" said Robert Louis Stevenson.  Lewis and Clark said "that's not <br/>
an island, that's just the other bank of the creek."  But no one <br/>
listened.  "Follow me, mates" said Stevenson as he walked boldly <br/>
across the fallen log.  His more cautious companions looked up and <br/>
down the creek until they could find another way to cross.  <br/>
<br/>
Box 5.  Robert Louis Stevenson's Box<br/>
To find Stevenson's treasure, go to the "island".  At the end of the <br/>
log bridge are other segments of rotted logs touching the bridge.  <br/>
Under the longest, at the end furthest from the bridge, is <br/>
Stevenson's treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone was now ready to call it a day.  They all returned to the<br/>
"mainland".  They decided not to backtrack and continued on the easier<br/>
path.  By now, even Lewis and Clark had gotten tired of taking <br/>
compass readings.  They kept the houses on their left and followed <br/>
the curving path where it kept meeting up with larger and larger <br/>
trails.  In no time they were back to the path leading to the stump <br/>
where they had left Louisa May Alcott.  They went to collect her and <br/>
then finished the walk down the hill.  Everyone had a great day of <br/>
walking and talking.  Everyone, that is, but Lewis and Clark.<br/>

Here are some directions from the Dead Author's creator - aren't the boxes great?  Gaab, Mom of Cricket Bros<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for writing about my Dead Authors box. Since you haven't <br/>
gotten to Boxes 3, 4, 5 I might save you some aggravation by <br/>
clarifying a clue on box 3. Someone else wrote that they couldn't <br/>
find Box 3 because they didn't see the T in the path. I guess it's <br/>
not really a true T, maybe an italic T, but the little path you are on <br/>
meets up with a slightly wider path that comes down the hill. There <br/>
were people jogging on it when I was there. That is the T I mean. <br/>
There is a fallen tree right there that touches but does not cross the <br/>
path. These are the clues you need for box 3.<br/>
<br/>
Box 4 has subtle landmarks and you have to look carefully. The <br/>
hollies are skinny little things but are right on the path. Put your <br/>
uphill arm out and you will hit them. Well, maybe you won't hit them <br/>
because the trees are shorter than that. But bring along a 1st grader <br/>
and his uphill arm will hit them.<br/>
