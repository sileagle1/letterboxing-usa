allow no attatchments. I belong to a group of painters on Yahoo and <br/>
that is how our list is run. Many people on the painting list are new <br/>
computer users and prefer not to have attatchments. I read the <br/>
letterbox list online so I do not have attatchments mailed to me.  <br/>

a few days, I will delete this file, because it lists me as the <br/>

eGroups/Yahoo send a note to the list that it's been added.<br/>

we "protect" an author's clues: when you create a letterbox it is <br/>
yours to own and nobody fusses with your "copyright." When the <br/>
webmasters create "courtesy pages" of clues for you, they cut-and-<br/>
paste everything, including typos and errors. The attachements are a <br/>
way for letterboxers to assert finer control over the look of their <br/>
clues.<br/>
<br/>
I know it's possible to pass around viruses that way as well, so it's <br/>
a bit of a dilemma, but in all I like 'em.<br/>
<br/>
I rummaged around a bit looking for evidence that Yahoo!Groups has <br/>
scanning software, but couldn't find anything on it. I was surprised, <br/>
after several years on the list, to see that a virus had been sent to <br/>
the group. I thought the Yahoo folks would have a layer of protection <br/>
built in for us.<br/>

removing attachments from discussion lists like this one are always a good<br/>
thing. If you really want to provide icons, images, etc you can be just as<br/>
creative with a free web site service (like Geocities - wow, Yahoo owns that<br/>
too?) on the 'net. Just point folks to the web page for your hints and<br/>
whatnot.<br/>

Otherwise you're relying on the folks on the other end having virus filters,<br/>
which is usually on the end of the "todo" list.<br/>

I think it would be possible to upload to the files area in the <br/>
discussion group in any font you wanted. Someone with more computer <br/>
knowledge could check it out. The file tool is available on the Yahoo <br/>
group and I think it would be useful.<br/>
