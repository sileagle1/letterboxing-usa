&gt; Kroger often sells a knock-off version called Snap lock, both work<br/>
&gt;  well.<br/>
<br/>
I've found a couple boxes in the wild that were not Lock&amp;Lock but <br/>
were very similar, and had no visible brand name on them.  They had <br/>
one other difference:  On a Lock&amp;Lock, the flaps have rectangular <br/>
openings in them, and there are tabs sticking out the side of the <br/>
base that these snap onto.  On these knockoffs, that's reversed; the <br/>
tabs are sticking out of the flaps, and they snap onto the lip of the <br/>
base.<br/>
<br/>
That may sound like it wouldn't make any difference, but the *only* <br/>
complaint I've ever heard about a Lock&amp;Lock was that some nimnuls <br/>
have managed to put the cover on upside down.  It fits and snaps, but <br/>
doesn't seal, so everything inside gets ruined.  With the latch setup <br/>
on the knockoffs, installing the lid upside down isn't possible.  So, <br/>
from that particular viewpoint, these knockoffs are actually *better* <br/>
than genuine Lock&amp;Locks.<br/>
<br/>
I can hardly wait until most of the other food storage containers on <br/>
the market go away and most of the containers available are either <br/>
Lock&amp;Lock or a knockoff.  We'll all be so much better off, whether we <br/>
letterbox or not!  I've been spreading the word as well as I can to <br/>
friends and relatives that, if you're buying food storage containers, <br/>
they should be Lock&amp;Locks.  They generally recognize me as an <br/>
authority, too, because they know I letterbox!  Your cheap junk may <br/>
look like it's sealing OK in the refrigerator, but I field test these <br/>
containers -- in an actual field!<br/>
<br/>
The recent report about somebody hiding a letterbox in a Lock&amp;Lock <br/>
submerged and held down with rocks intrigues me.  Reportedly it's <br/>
working fine, still dry inside.  Lock&amp;Lock needs to use this guy in <br/>
an ad.<br/>

<br/>
BTW, one bit of advice for anyone running out to buy some <br/>
Lock&amp;Lock's:  Avoid the round ones.  The nature of the latch system <br/>
is such that a container with a rectangular lid will always seal <br/>
reliably but the round ones are an order of magnitude less reliable.  <br/>
They still reportedly seal pretty well, and better than many other <br/>
containers on the market, but if you've got a choice when buying <br/>
Lock&amp;Locks I suggest you choose the rectangular ones.<br/>

I've had several round one in the wild for some time now and had zero <br/>
problems, and have never found one with problems either.  I like them <br/>
because they are small and easy to hide.  Downside is you have to design <br/>
a box around them.<br/>
<br/>
Wal-Mart has been carrying Lock &amp; Locks for some time now.  I usually <br/>
pick up the three pack with one round one, a small one, and a mid sized <br/>
one for a bit less then $6.  I noticed Target is carrying the knock <br/>
offs.  I'll have to give them a try, I like the size of the 1 cup <br/>
containers for about $2.<br/>
