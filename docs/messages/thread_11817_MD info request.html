SHAMELESS PLUG ALERT.  you could be the first to snag the greenbelt lake beverage animal series by walking on a nice gravel trail and then jet over the college park (minutes away, but depending on where you park, this could involve a lot of walking) and hit the stinkeye (a [sub]urban microbox), mckeldin library (indoor), and testudo's hideout (walking on sidewalk and parking lot, watch out for worms) then drive another 10 minutes to takoma park and hit roscoe gives a tour (10 minute walk in small town neighborhood just outside of DC)<br/>
plugs aside.  I would personally recommend<br/>
1.  Savage historic mill-easy, good trails and very fun to do.  <br/>
2.  Brookside garden -very pretty, a lot of other places, you'd have to pay to enter a place like this but admission is free.  <br/>
3.  Wheaton regional park-cool stamp, right next to brookside garden, it's been there a while so there are a lot of cool entries in the logbook to read.  <br/>
4.  H is for Heron and Patty are quick, easy and closer to Baltimore than DC.<br/>
Ones that I would avoid if it were raining or if I were averse to long walks or mud would be Maryland my Maryland or the Rocky Gorge boxes.  BUT! those are REALLY FUN to do if it's not raining or you don't mind long walks and mud.  (We were stumped on a couple of the MD my MD and suspect that they are MIA but we are not sure.  <br/>

    I just planted 3 where H is for Heron. Planted this past Sunday, <br/>
posted on Monday, post # 24507. I don't believe it has made it to the <br/>
State Map List yet.<br/>
<br/>

    There are 5 more where MD my MD is located. Sheep series (3 quick <br/>
ones) Old Man Rufus and Patapsco Valley by twogreysquirrels. Shame on <br/>
you for not hunting them!! :-)<br/>

 Look for ones by Psychomommy and the Turtle. Turtles can't move too <br/>
fast so they are usually short walks. <br/>

boxes in the park.  If you move relatively quickly, you could <br/>
probably snag them all within a couple of hours.  And yes, this is a <br/>
plug too because the ADG and Squirrel's Girls planted all 8 boxes.  <br/>
