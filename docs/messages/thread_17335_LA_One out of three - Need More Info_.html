Thanks for the report.  I will be going to Louisiana over<br/>
New Years and would appreciate any info on other boxes there.  <br/>
I plan to look for most of the ones that show up when I do <br/>
a search for Louisiana boxes, but I was wondering if there <br/>
are any not showing up in the search (e.g. the Mystery<br/>
box link is invalid so not sure if it still exists or how to<br/>
get the clues).  Also, if you know of any that are definetly<br/>
missing or gone for repairs I would appreciate that info, too.<br/>
As payment I hope to place a few boxes along the way for your<br/>
finding pleasure.  Merry Christmas!<br/>

My Cancer Corner box was found earlier this month, so it's probably <br/>
still out there.  The vast majority of people who look for it don't <br/>
seem to find it, though, so take any reports of it missing with a big <br/>
grain of salt.  It might be true someday, but it's managed to stick <br/>
it out for the better part of a year without going missing despite <br/>
all the reports I've gotten about it doing just that.  =)<br/>

Thanks, I'll try to check before I leave for any new <br/>
boxes.  On Friday, 1/2/04 I plan to go after your Fort Pike<br/>
box, then up to the Lock boxes &amp; Talisheek, then over to Abita <br/>
Springs and back to New Orleans.  Unfortunately I won't have <br/>
time to look for all your others near Mandeville but wish I could.<br/>
I found a message in the Talklist Archives with the clues to<br/>
the Mystery box so I may give it a try, though not sure if<br/>
it still exists.  If you know of any I could go for near this<br/>
route (e.g. just across border into Mississippi) please email<br/>
me offlist.  Thanks again, and if you are out and about on that<br/>
day maybe I'll run into you.<br/>
