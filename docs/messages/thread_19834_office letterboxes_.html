I would say maybe consider clearing it with your boss first?  <br/>
<br/>
Even if the clues give acceptable times to show up, you can probably rely on <br/>
there being folks who either aren't going to read all that closely, or who <br/>
just may not care.  <br/>
<br/>
And if you have an office that's "quiet" the powers-that-be or fellow <br/>
co-workers might like it that way.  Imagine various ways that box-seekers might <br/>
"disturb the peace" to see if the rest of the staff would be OK with it. <br/>
<br/>
(When I asked permission to put a couple in a cemetery, the owner told me <br/>
fine, in fact he was even a little thrilled with it, but he made very sure I <br/>
understood that the clues had to be written in such a way that the box-seekers <br/>
would not be coming into the office to ask office personnel for help in figuring <br/>
out any of the clues.  For example, I can't mention actual gravestone names <br/>
because seekers might come into the office asking office folks to look up <br/>
gravesite locations of any person with that last name.  So I got permission to do <br/>
it, but I have to run my clues by the office manager first for approval.) <br/>
<br/>
Ignore all of the above however if you happen to be the boss.  :-)<br/>

Definitely something most folks would need to consider.  In my case, <br/>
there is building security, floor security, electronic passcards and <br/>
a reception area, meaning I'd have to come sign them in at the front <br/>
desk and personally escort them to and from my office.<br/>
<br/>
But for some folks, this might be very possible to pursue.  <br/>
Especially if, as you noted, they are the boss.  Or own the <br/>
business.  Lots of options, I'd think.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the feedback though,<br/>
