I have a trail where I'd love to hide some boxes, but it's a marsh/grassland<br/>
(so no rocks or logs) and all the structures along the trail seem to be<br/>
built in a way that makes hiding things most difficult. There is a 6-8" gap<br/>
at the bottom of all the walls, the benches are 2x4's that have spacers<br/>
between the boards (so you can see thru them), and the undersides of the<br/>
roofs are smooth!<br/>
<br/>
I created a 'box' by using a dremel to carve out a piece of 2x4 and using 2<br/>
large 'keyhole' hangers that I hope will work to keep it in place under a<br/>
bench while keeping it easily accessible. I figured since 2x4's were most<br/>
prevelent, using a 2x4 would help it blend in with the 'area'. I also bought<br/>
some black, fake leather eye glass cases that are thin that I am thinking of<br/>
using Velcro to attach to the under side of the supports for a small 'table'<br/>
in the center of one of the shelters. I'd prefer to use regular size<br/>
stamps/logs, but will go to micro boxes if I have to.<br/>

<div>OK!  Thanks all for the feedback.  I got 
one 'Go for it!' and a few 'Not really my thing' so I'm gonna have to go 
with a no on this one.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'll just have to stretch myself a little in 
finding ways to place boxes.  I imagine after finding a few more boxes, I 
will develop a more attuned sense of what is possible in terms of hiding 
places.</div>
