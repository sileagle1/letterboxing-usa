I had no idea back when I hid those first two boxes at Wendell in <br/>

yesterday. The food        (thanks for the veggie burgers!), the stamps, the <br/>
park everything was perfect. The event stamps were wonderful, I know Brian <br/>
carved one. Great job!<br/>
The birthday present exchange was fun and a great idea. Of course no <br/>
gathering would be complete without all the wonderful family we see at these <br/>
events. Some brand new and some we've known only by stamp. Others we've seen <br/>
time and time again and we grow more found of eah other each time we meet <br/>
and you know who you are.<br/>
Thanks to Dave and Charlotte for sharing the trail with us and letting Max <br/>
be the leader...I know it added hours to your hunt.<br/>
<br/>
In case anyone is missing a fanny pack loaded with letterboxing stuff....I <br/>
brought it home with me. So let me know who you are and if you describe <br/>
exactly the contents I will get it to you promptly!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the great day,<br/>

with Team Green Dragon and Wanda &amp; Pete, and we also enjoyed meeting <br/>
some new boxers and chatting with others we've met before.  We were <br/>
especially pleased to meet Bonnie and Betsey! <br/>
<br/>
El Corazon and Vincent were my F8 and F9 respectively, and it was a relief to <br/>
finally add St-Exupery to my found list.  I hate to leave a series unfinished!<br/>

at this, our first, gathering. It was quite overwhelming at first but <br/>
everyone was so warm and friendly that you all quickly made us feel <br/>
at home. Deanne and Ginger pulled off an amazing event! We also <br/>
enjoyed a memorable boxing moment with TeamGreenDragon as darkness <br/>
fell that night (which I'll leave for them to announce).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Bonnie for having the shared vision (along with the rest of <br/>
the US boxing founders) to plant those 1998 boxes! It was an honor to <br/>
stamp them into our logbooks. We also located the 1999 North Quabbin <br/>
boxes yesterday...a little leaky but not damaged.<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to Max (5 yrs old) for leading us on a long trek for <br/>
three of the Wendell series! You are a fearless (and concientious) <br/>
leader indeed! :)<br/>
