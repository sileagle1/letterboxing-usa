(Irish Roots Box)<br/>
<br/>
Coventry, CT<br/>
<br/>
Planted by Irish Tinker. <br/>

To find this box you will have to translate the Gaelic words to English. The Gaelic words are in italics. I am rating this fairly easy. The walk is easy and if you figure a few key words out the translation will be easy. <br/>
<br/>
Starting point: From Hale Homestead drive-way turn left onto South Street. Pass Strong-Porter house on the right. The trail is on the right. You can park on either side of road. Walk around the brown geata. <br/>

Follow direach. At ceathair bealach intersection iontaim ceart. Follow until you come to the small cosan on the ceart. Go this way. Follow until you come to a cloch balla. Count steps. On the cuigiu step go chle. You will be walking over lots of marbh coill. Continue until you come to a cloch balla with a large oscailte spot. Isnt this a pretty cloch balla? Go thrid, on the chle in a poll covered by coill is the bosca!<br/>

Enjoy and rehide well!<br/>
