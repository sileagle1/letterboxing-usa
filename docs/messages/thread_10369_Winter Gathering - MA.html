                    <html><body><p>I want to add my voice to the chorus of thank yous.  The 6 hour drive from Mount Desert Island to Sharon was definitely worth it.  My friend Deb and I had a great afternoon.  It was great to put some faces to names (stamps!) and to chat with people I have felt I have known through the web site.  Many thanks to everyone who planted boxes, inside and out, and to all those who brought along hitchhikers to share.  (I still have never actually found one in a box!)  And special thanks to the organizers.  What a lovely place you chose for the gathering!  I hope to be able to come back in spring or fall to look for the permanent boxes.  Thanks to everyone for such a great first gathering for me!</p>
