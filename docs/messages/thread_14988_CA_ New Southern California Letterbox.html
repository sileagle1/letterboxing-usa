California letterboxing lately especially thanks to the Gnosis 4-H <br/>
Club, who are bringing Connecticut-style letterboxing to Los Angeles <br/>
County, and the efforts of Purple Iris and Jam &amp; Jelly.  Here is my <br/>
latest edition to the scene which is listed on the LBNA Web site:<br/>

PASADENA HUMANE SOCIETY LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Placed by:  Buzzard<br/>
Placement date:  July 20, 2003<br/>
State:  California<br/>
County:  Los Angeles<br/>
Nearest City:  Pasadena<br/>
Number of boxes:  1<br/>
<br/>
Clues<br/>
<br/>
Distance:  A few feet<br/>
Difficulty:  Very easy<br/>
Directions:  The Pasadena Humane Society is located at 361 South <br/>
Raymond Avenue, Pasadena, CA, and the phone number is (626) 792-<br/>
3810.  Take the Fair Oaks Drive exit off the 210 Freeway in <br/>
Pasadena.  Go south on Fair Oaks for a few blocks, then turn left <br/>
(east) onto Del Mar Avenue.  At the next light, make a right turn <br/>
(south) onto South Raymond Avenue.  The Pasadena Humane Society is <br/>
the second building on the right.  The shelter is open 9AM-5PM Monday <br/>
through Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
Pasadenans love their dogs, and this is one of my favorite Pasadena <br/>
places.  Like thousands of others, here is where my family found its <br/>
best friend.  The state-of-the-art Pasadena Humane Society animal <br/>
adoption facility was completed in 1994, and incorporates the <br/>
original Pasadena Humane Society's 1914-era buildings.  The main <br/>
building, which is a registered historic landmark, houses the offices <br/>
and a pet supply store.  The open air dog kennels are filled with <br/>
flowering plants and trees, fresh breezes, and sunlight.  The kennels <br/>
have a raised shelter in the back for the dogs, which is heated and <br/>
cooled through water pipes.  The cat shelter features skylights, big <br/>
windows, and mobiles hanging from the ceiling to help provide visual <br/>
stimulation.  Besides dogs and cats, the shelter accepts every kind <br/>
of animal including rabbits, guinea pigs, exotic birds, hamsters, <br/>
rats, chickens, a raptor named Moe, and even an alligatora big one.  <br/>
I come here often to visit the dogs, which some people have been <br/>
known to play with through the generously-spaced kennel bars <br/>
(germicidal hand-cleaning lotion dispensers are strategically placed <br/>
throughout the area).  You will not need a Blue Tick Coon Hound <br/>
(which I once saw up for adoption here) to find this letterbox.  Just <br/>
right of the north entrance to the facility's small parking lot is a <br/>
waist-high planter.  At the extreme southwest corner of the planter, <br/>
underneath some vegitation, you'll find the letterbox.  Although I <br/>
like the location of this box, this can be a very busy street, so try <br/>
as best you can to be discreet.  The shrubbery in this planter justs <br/>
lifts up whole if you grab a section, and the letterbox is right <br/>
there near the edge, so lift and grab; if you don't see it right <br/>
away, it's probably gone.  The Crown City Brewery, located just <br/>
across the street, provides a convenient location to sip a freshly-<br/>
made beer (Arroyo Amber Ale is a favorite), have lunch ($7-$10), and <br/>
stamp in.<br/>
