research staff here at The Equity Reporter has uncovered a company in the lucrative long distance provider industry. 
Pipeline Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: PLTN) is a national provider of Flat Rate Nationwide Calling. Flat Rate Nationwide 
Calling is changing the way people pay for long distance services. "Flat Rate" means one rate per month - every month. 
Businesses and consumers enjoy substantial savings, plus the freedom to talk for a longer period of time, while controlling 
the costs of long distance spending. That's why, with PLTN, Freedom is Calling.</p></blockquote><p></p><table border="2" bordercolor="#FFFFFF" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#003399" height="30" width="100%"><p align="center"><b>The Company's Competitive 
Edge</b></p></td></tr></table><blockquote><p>PLTN's corporate attitude is driven 
by the desire to provide the highest quality service at the lowest prices while enhancing profits and shareholders' value. At 
the same time, their philosophy is to capitalize on the current climate in the telecommunications industry. In every industry 
downturn, opportunities can present themselves for a small, aggressive company like PLTN to develop relations with 
corporations that have networks, infrastructure, and personnel, but lack sufficient customers. This is where PLTN has the 
advantage. By utilizing strategic partnerships with those who are recognized leaders in the field, PLTN is able to rapidly bring 
to the market fully integrated products and services demanded by both residential and business customers 
alike.</p></blockquote><table border="2" bordercolor="#FFFFFF" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#003399" height="30" width="100%"><p align="center"><b>Breaking 
News</b></p></td></tr></table><blockquote><p>PLTN has recently entered into an 
agreement to offer its domestic long distance services to Flor-Tex Marketing, Inc., an 80,000 member sales organization that 
represents one of the largest, most respected providers of prepaid legal services. With the typical member using 
approximately 1000/month, a conservative 10% coverage of the sales force could equate to gross monthly revenues to 
PLTN of $400,000.<br/><br/>PLTN's new philosophy of streamlining overhead and expanding product lines through 
outsourcing with new industry partners has already drastically reduced monthly corporate overhead by 60%. At the same 
time the company is reducing its overhead, it is expanding product lines by partnering with companies to provide 
multi-network connections that include both PSTN and VOIP networks. This ability has created new products for the 
company to market at highly competitive prices. PLTN should maintain this competitive edge through the continuing ability to 
negotiate prices for products without the constraints faced by their remaining competitors.</p></blockquote><table border="2" bordercolor="#FFFFFF" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#003399" height="30" width="100%"><p align="center"><b>Investment 
Considerations</b></p></td></tr></table><blockquote><p>As stated before, PLTN is 
already a viable company that has reduced its corporate overhead by 60%. This new development, combined with an 
expected yearly boost in revenues of $4,800,000 or .34 cents a share could very well make this one a high growth 
investment play in 2002.</p></blockquote></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#336699" height="368" valign="top" width="100%">DISCLAIMER:<br/>Information within this email contains
