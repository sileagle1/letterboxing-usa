What better way to end the holiday, finding FrankenFish.  Hate to say <br/>

Going through my favorite recipes so we won't starve.  Maybe I'll be <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">---Regarding my previous post;  No there wasn't any fish in the <br/>
movie. It was just scary and somehow in my dreams the word <br/>
FrankenFish kept appearing.  Sorry for the confusion.  Hope this <br/>
clears that post. <br/>
   For those that are unfamiliar with FrankenFish (as it is called <br/>
here in the Balto/Wash area) it has to do with some fish that a man <br/>
bought for medicinal purposes.  I think the fish originates in China <br/>
and the people there make a soup out of it for some kind of illness. <br/>
So this man in Crofton, MD didn't use all the fish so he threw them <br/>
into a pond.  They multiplied and ate all the good fish.  These ugly <br/>
fish can live out of the water too!  Some travelled to other ponds. <br/>
Now the trouble is how to kill them.  The End.<br/>
