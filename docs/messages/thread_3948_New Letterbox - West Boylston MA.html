Trail Advisories: <br/>
Approx 4 miles walk round trip. <br/>
Some areas will be muddy. <br/>
Reachable by XC ski when there is sufficient snow.<br/>
<br/>
Drive:<br/>
Take Exit 5 off Rt 190, to Rt 140 South.<br/>
After one mile, the is a fork in the road. <br/>
Rt 140 goes left, take the right fork.<br/>
Go one-tenth mile. <br/>
A baseball field will be on your left.  <br/>
Park on the right before you cross the water. <br/>
<br/>
Walk:<br/>
Proceed down the Central Mass Rail Trail.  The river will <br/>
be on your left. The groomed rail trail ends at a river crossing, <br/>
1.75 miles along, where there used to be a RR bridge.  <br/>
<br/>
Take the path heading north, high along the bank of the river. <br/>
The river will be to your left.  After a while, a tributary brook <br/>
comes in from the right. Keep following the path, with the <br/>
tributary to your left. <br/>
<br/>
There is a fallen tree whose trunk lies along 15 degrees, and <br/>
forks into two smaller trunks, and those smaller trunks lie <br/>
squarely across the path (one goes only partway across the <br/>
path as it was broken off). <br/>
<br/>
Stand between the two trunks and look down to the base of the <br/>
main trunk. Just beyond it are two standing trees. You will see <br/>
in between those trees a squarish rock. (This may not be visible <br/>
in full summer due to leaves.) This is your destination, but <br/>
continue along the path. <br/>
<br/>
In about 25 paces you will have to take a few steps across <br/>
the tops of rocks, and the path will fork widely in front of you.  <br/>
The left fork crosses the brook. Take the right fork which heads <br/>
out at 70 degrees. Walk about 23 steps and to your right will<br/>
be a roughly cube-shaped rock, covered with moss and lichen,<br/>
about 30 inches high.  You will find what you are looking for <br/>
on the far side of this rock. <br/>
