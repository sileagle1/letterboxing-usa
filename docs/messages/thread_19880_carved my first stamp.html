I carved my first stamp on an artgum eraser.  I know it's not the <br/>
best material, but I was working on something else and saw it sitting <br/>
there. On impulse I doodled on it and carved it with a speedball <br/>
cutter kit.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out surprisingly good.  If I can ever get it away from my <br/>
daughter who is currently madly stamping with it I will probably use <br/>
it in a box.  All I will say is that it has an Alaska theme.  : )<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, How is this going to hold up over time though? Maybe I will <br/>
have to redo it on better material. <br/>
<br/>
Cool, that was fun and really not hard at all, LOL.<br/>

I put my initial "F" into the foam of a cute caterpillar with an exacto<br/>
knife . . .<br/>
and, yep, forgot to do mirror image in my excitement.<br/>
<br/>
So, from now on, when I stamp in, the "F" in Froggiebaby<br/>
will have to be backward just to save face.<br/>
