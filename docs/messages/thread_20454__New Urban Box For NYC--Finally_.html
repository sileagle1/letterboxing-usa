Took me two hours of walking around in the area I wanted but I finally found a place. Got my exercise for today. I also had to cut everything down and make them mini boxes. Mini and micro is the way to go for the kinds of places I want to put them and I didn't realize that until I had done all four of them. We live and learn!<br/>

Well, shucks, I was just up near Mt. Sinai medical school on the weekend.  Are the new boxes near there?  Or any others?  (96th and 2nd Ave.)  I was a little too busy fattening up on Vietnamese food, Puerto Rican food, clotted cream on scones, and bundts to get very far on foot, however. --lunaryakketyact<br/>
