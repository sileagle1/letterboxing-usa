The Pelican letterbox link on the LBNA site is dead, but I found a copy of <br/>
the clues on a cached Google page. It's possible the link is dead for a <br/>
reason - the box is gone without a trace. After musing on what constitutes <br/>
a prickly pear cactus "grotto," we believe we found the correct eucalyptus <br/>
tree, especially considering the small path dead ending at it and the <br/>
unnatural hole covered by debris at its roots. Alas, the hole was empty.<br/>
<br/>
We backtracked and set out to find Gwen &amp; Don's Shore Bird box. Well, at <br/>
least two of us did, as Uncle MoJo JoJo and Mrs. T waited on the benches at <br/>
the interpretive center with little Strawberry Girl (muttering something <br/>
about the heat getting to them). Lone Wolf and I continued on our quest but <br/>
were ultimately unsuccessful. I think we found the right "large bush," but <br/>
it's possible that it's grown so much in the almost two years since the box <br/>
was planted that the hiding place is now even deeper inside. If we didn't <br/>
have impatient family members waiting (and if the box is still there) I'm <br/>
sure we could've found it with a little more effort.<br/>
<br/>
The trip was definitely not a failure, though. The sky was clear and blue, <br/>
the sun was warm and bright, and we could almost hear the waves crashing on <br/>
the other side of Pacific Coast Highway. The best part of all was exploring <br/>
an amazing bird sanctuary less than five miles from where I grew up that I <br/>
somehow had never set foot in before. We saw brown pelicans, "regular" <br/>
pelicans, terns, seagulls and so many other unidentified feathery friends. <br/>
We watched in awe the little birds that dove underwater after fish and <br/>
stayed there for unbelievably long periods of time. Thanks Gwen, Dawn and <br/>
Wendy for giving us a reason to go explore.<br/>

P.S. On another hike with a different set of relatives yesterday, we <br/>
planted a new Orange County box. Clues to come as soon as I find time to <br/>
write them...<br/>
