<div>Hi Melissa</div>
<div> </div>
<div>thanks for the status report. I was afeared that 
this box may go missing. It is in a pretty location, and it only takes one 
curious set of eyes. I will get a replacement stamp and replace the box first 
chance i get.</div>

&gt;     Tonight Dan and I returned to Point Judith to have a cookout by the<br/>

It was a beautiful stamp. I'm sorry to hear that it's gone. Maybe someone<br/>
will find it and return it. I just don't *get it* when they are missing.  It<br/>
was tucked underneath there really well a few months ago, but there are<br/>
probably so many people all over that area that either someone could have<br/>
spotted a letterboxer finding or replacing it or someone just stumbled upon<br/>
it. :-(  But why keep it or destroy it? What does anyone get out of doing<br/>
that?<br/>
