                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have planted my first letterbox near the Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest in <br/>
Graham County, NC.<br/>
<br/>
The Forest is about 14 miles from Robbinsville, the nearest town.  <br/>
(Robbinsville is about 2 hours west of Asheville - take I-40 west to Exit <br/>
27, then follow Great Smoky Mountain Expressway on US19 South; pass Cherokee <br/>
and Bryson City, then watch for the Robbinsville sign just before the <br/>
Nantahala Gorge).  There is USFS camping nearby on Santeelah Creek.<br/>
<br/>
The trail is not steep or difficult, but is not suitable for wheelchairs or <br/>
strollers or street footwear; ankle supporting shoes/boots are best.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the signs from Robbinsville to the Forest.  Drive to the parking lot <br/>
and find the information kiosk which shows the map and the famous "Trees" <br/>
poem by Joyce Kilmer.  Then follow the clues:<br/>
