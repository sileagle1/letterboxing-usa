                    <div class="plaintext-content">TeamGreenDragon recently broke the F500 barrier and to celebrate I <br/>
carved us a new Sig stamp . I just could not wait to get it into <br/>
action , so I headed for the Blue Hills . After checking on some of <br/>
our boxes there , ( where I learned that some people consider me to <br/>
be an " Evil Evil man " ) I went in search of  " My Love " . Since we <br/>
had already found the " Blue Hills " box that this was replacing , <br/>
this was fairly easy . Also I lightened my load a little while <br/>
there . After this I headed for one of my favorite trails in the <br/>
hills to search for The WindupHiker's elusive " Forest Hoops " box . <br/>
After some head scratching and fumbling around awhile I manage to <br/>
locate this one also . Both boxes are in great shape with some <br/>
interesting entries , I think concerning the upcoming King Richards <br/>
Fair. It will be interesting to check into this when we attend . All <br/>
in all , I had a great day off from work . We plan to join up with <br/>
Solar and Blinx this weekend to do battle with some pirates that have <br/>
been stirring up trouble in Hingham harbor . And probably will make a <br/>
trip to the end of the world .<br/>
<br/>
Thanks All !!<br/>
