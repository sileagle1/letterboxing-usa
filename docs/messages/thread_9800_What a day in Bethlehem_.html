                    <html><body>All I have to say is... WOW!  It was another great day of letterboxing out in western CT today!  Bluebird and Butterfly tired me out (which is not too hard!), taking me to a total of 17 boxes and four hitchhikers!
<br/>
<br/>Our day started in Bethlehem, where I was able to stamp into the Moose is Loose and the Zandar Codex Hitchhikers, while stamping into the six boxes from the Christmas in Bethlehem series.  After the Christmas in Bethlehem series, we started a series of our own at the post office!  Bluebird, and especially Butterfly, and I were going gaga over the fifty or so different Christmas in Bethlehem Connecticut stamps!  I just happened to have a Christmas card in the car, so I filled the back side with beautiful stamps!  After leaving Bethlehem, we stopped at the White Memorial Foundation Nature Preserve and found the May box (didn't have time for Alain's box).  Onward to Litchfield to find the Wild Walk Letterboxing series, also stamping into the Traveling Valentine Hitchhiker.  After that, we went to St. Veronica's Letterbox at the Stations of the Cross Shrine, had a little lunch in town, and went on to the Harwinton Rec Series, stamping into "A Grand Day Out" hitchhiker there.  It was certainly "A Grand Day Out"!  Thanks Butterfly and Bluebird for a great day!
<br/>
<br/>I hope everyone has a happy and healthy holiday season!  See you out on the trails!

Music women said most of it. We had a great time boxing today. The<br/>
stamps out there in the' West '- are great . When you get a change, go .<br/>
All the hikes were nice , the long long board walk was my favorite. If<br/>
we tired Music Women out as she said, you much remember that Bluebird<br/>
and I have wings. We do tend to GO<br/>
Happy Holidays to you all and I hope Santa brings you all new carving<br/>
stuff and maybe even a few boxes<br/>

ran me into the ground, so don't feel bad. :)  <br/>

Glad to see the Litchfield boxes visited, too bad you didn't get out <br/>
to Alain's, it's a truly enchanted spot and I took a number of <br/>
pictures there, including one I use as "wallpaper" on my work computer <br/>
and several people have commented on it. Be sure to make the trip back <br/>
sometime.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays to all, and Happy Wintertime Trails too!<br/>
