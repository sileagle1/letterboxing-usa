"FOR BULK ORDERS ONLY" ?   The patches need a bulk order of 50 or more and <br/>
the decals need a bulk order of 25 or more.  Also we should have the Town <br/>
Hall Embroidery address instead of mine.<br/>
<br/>
After this order I want to avoid having people send money to me when I don't <br/>
have enough to make the order.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the shop sends an estimate to me for the individual patches I'll <br/>
forward that info for a new "INDIVIDUAL ORDER   FORM",  The individual <br/>
patches won't be as good a quantity as the bulk order patches.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks alot for all your work,<br/>
Kay<br/>
