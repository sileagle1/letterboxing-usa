On  November 23, 2001 Funhog placed two new letterboxes at Ridgefield<br/>
National Wildlife Refuge near Ridgefield in Clark County, Washington.<br/>
This lovely refuge is another great place for birds. During the summer<br/>
you can hike at both units of the Refuge. In order to protect migratory<br/>
waterfowl, the Carty Unit trail is the only section open during the<br/>
winter months. At this time of year the River S Unit is accessible only<br/>
as an auto tour route.<br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: Take exit 14 from I-5. Go west on 501 to the town of<br/>
Ridgefield. The Carty Unit is north (right) on Main Street and the River<br/>
S Unit is south (left) on 9th Street. The entrances to both units are<br/>
marked with large brown signs.<br/>
<br/>
to the Carty Box: Follow the Oak to Wetlands Trail counter clockwise<br/>
around the marsh. Keep on the main trail which is periodically marked<br/>
with small arrows. When you are given a choice between a prime number<br/>
and a dozen, go for the prime. At the next fork go left. The trail will<br/>
become rocky as you go up a knoll crowned with two oak trees. Five paces<br/>
beyond the second oak you will be standing on stone with the marsh dead<br/>
ahead. The letterbox is fourteen paces at 245 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
to the River S Box: Go to the one place inside this portion of the<br/>
Refuge that you are permitted get out of your car during the Winter<br/>
Solstice. Head for the stilted structure. Fifty-six paces beyond<br/>
Billies branches the letterbox rests beside the trail.<br/>
