                    <html><body><div>Yesterday we set out for Rocky Neck SP hoping to hit 100, but came up one short.  We stopped in Branford on our way home, hoping for that one box, but the dusk and fog did us in.  We had to wait for the New Year for #100, and it is a very fitting stamp, indeed, for our milestone: Butterfly's<em> Bear's Gift </em>at Sleeping Giant SP, just as the rain was starting to fall.</div> <div>I am now working on carving a new stamp for us, hopefully before the Winter Gathering on the 18th.</div> <div> </div> <div>Thanks to all the people who have planted boxes in Connecticut - we have visited so many wonderful new places in the past 2 months, and thanks to the webmasters for all of their hard work. It is appreciated!</div> <div> </div> <div>sadie &amp; russ<br/><br/></div></body></html>
