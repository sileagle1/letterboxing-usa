ATTENTION NEW, OR BEGINNING LETTERBOXERS:<br/>
If you you are new to this activity because of the article in Time <br/>
magazine, or have come to it in some other way please read this <br/>
first.<br/>
<br/>
New participants are always welcome, but before you begin searching <br/>
for letterboxes, please take a moment to consider this  think of <br/>
the effort that goes into carving a stamp, maybe even hand making a <br/>
logbook, and then to find a secure spot to hide the box in the <br/>
vicinity of a certain area or site. All of that effort spent for no <br/>
other reason that to bring some enjoyment into the world.<br/>
<br/>
Be aware of your surroundings; enjoy the view from where you are. <br/>
Letterboxes are often place in areas for a certain reason, spend a <br/>
moment to consider why the placer may have chosen to share this area <br/>
with others, by drawing them here with the lure of a letterbox find.<br/>
<br/>
Survey the area for people who may be watching what you're doing. <br/>
Remember, a common activity is "people watching"... someone may be <br/>
watching you! Please don't give away the hiding spot to others who <br/>
might not share the appreciation of this activity. If you will use <br/>
care when you replace the box in it's hiding space, you can be sure <br/>
you won't contribute to a box being lost, stolen, or destroyed. <br/>
<br/>
Consider that there would be no letterboxing, if there were no boxes <br/>
to find. Missing boxes not only deprive other boxers of the same <br/>
sense of enjoyment you just experienced, but the person who created <br/>
the box has lost all the time they spent and sadly, may someday <br/>
choose to stop placing boxes.<br/>

I don't think they hate new "players" at all. It's just trying to <br/>
educate newbies a bit that this is meant to be a stealth but <br/>
enjoyable hobby. Too many boxes get trashed or go missing, in part <br/>
because people re-hide them correctly. A lot of the joy in finding a <br/>
box can be discovering a place you never knew existed or enjoying a <br/>
beatiful view you've never seen before.<br/>
<br/>
And if I may relay one of the LBMA'ers stories very quickly, a newbie <br/>
recently found one of his boxes. They decided that the stamp needed <br/>
to be "improved" and they carved on his stamp! Not only that, but <br/>
they decided that they had found a better hiding spot for his box and <br/>
hid it elsewhere. My point is is that people new to this hobby often <br/>
don't know the nuances and the ins &amp; outs of it. It sounds to me like <br/>
the person who put the disclaimer at the end of his/her clues was <br/>
just trying to educate the newbie a little bit. <br/>

Saturday &amp; ran into a couple on the trail looking for a box.  We <br/>
stopped &amp; were going to exchange with them but they had no stamp, <br/>
book or anything.  They said they "were bored &amp; read it in the paper <br/>
&amp; thought they would come out to see what this was all about."  I <br/>
think this is a plea to think about this whole thing before you jump <br/>
in haphazardly, or a plea to someone not to destroy these things.<br/>

<br/>
I happen to know that this message is not meant to be hostile or to<br/>
reject new boxers.  It's a request for respect to the box and the<br/>
placer who created it.  Lately there's been a rash of letterboxes that<br/>
have been left exposed, tossed near the hiding spot but not rehidden.<br/>
   The message is asking for care, and it is also trying to educate<br/>
those who are new and who aren't aware of the protocol.  That's all it<br/>
is.  No insult intended.  The boxer is really very nice. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I stumbled upon letterboxing nearly a year ago because of a magazine<br/>
article.  I did not take time to careful read the FAQs or to subscribe to<br/>
the list and learn first; I read enough to get the basics and set out that<br/>
night with the family in tow.  I was lucky in that the article I read<br/>
emphasized the discretion aspect.  Since then, I have become a decent<br/>
letterboxed and shudder at some of my earlier errors.  I also shudder a bit<br/>
when I read some of the posts from some of the new boxers who have come here<br/>
because of the most recent article--and wonder about those who do not even<br/>
take the time to join a list such as this.  What havoc are they wreaking?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think this note is a gentle  wake-up call especially in the wake of an<br/>
article that reached so many people and has generated a lot of<br/>
interest--and, while some very sincere letterboxers are being introduced to<br/>
the hobby, many more will attempt a few boxes then loose interest. These are<br/>
the ones less likely to respect the nuances of letterboxing and  announce to<br/>
everyone on the trail what they are looking for; these are the ones that try<br/>
to get large groups involved before they truly understand and have<br/>
experienced letterboxing.  These are the people who  plop down next to the<br/>
hiding spot to stamp in, and then casually rehide the box (I actually<br/>
thought leaving a corner of the box exposed was a good thing--that it would<br/>
make it easier for the next seeker to find the box!  I am much better now!)<br/>
<br/>
So, if you are serious about the hobby <grin> take this note as intended and<br/>
heed any of the points that apply to you.  If none do, nod wisely and get<br/>
out there and box!<br/>

I actually think it wouldn't be a bad idea to put a short piece (on <br/>

give gentle guidelines about letterboxing. <br/>

That would help people who find them accidentally or new people from <br/>

And maybe also point them to the various discussion groups if they're <br/>
interested.  If I remember right (which is often in doubt), I don't think the Time <br/>
magazine article that I read that got me started in this mentioned any <br/>
discussion groups.  <br/>
<br/>
And with as much as it seems like everybody just everybody is on the internet <br/>
these days, there are still a ton of folks out there that have absolutely no <br/>
idea what an email discussion group is and who have never heard the word <br/>
yahoogroups, not to mention the other sites out there that have groups.  Just when <br/>
*I'm* thinkin' that the word yahoogroups will soon be found in the dictionary, <br/>
someone looks at me and says "Ya *what* groups?  You mean Ya *hoo* as in <br/>
Mountain Dew?"  Then they crack themselves up with their joke, and when they <br/>
settle down, I find out they've never heard of a discussion group.<br/>

<br/>
Sure, some may meet their demise because of the publicity, but <br/>
overall the activity probably benefits from the increased awareness. <br/>
I think this letter is one way too help minimize negative experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Now, who all is going to be watching me make an idiot of myself later <br/>
this week looking for my first? :)<br/>

&gt; ATTENTION NEW, OR BEGINNING LETTERBOXERS:<br/>
&gt; If you you are new to this activity because of the article in Time <br/>
&gt; magazine, or have come to it in some other way please read this <br/>
&gt; first.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; New participants are always welcome, but before you begin searching <br/>
&gt; for letterboxes, please take a moment to consider this  think<br/>
of <br/>
&gt; the effort that goes into carving a stamp, maybe even hand making a <br/>
&gt; logbook, and then to find a secure spot to hide the box in the <br/>
&gt; vicinity of a certain area or site. All of that effort spent for no <br/>
&gt; other reason that to bring some enjoyment into the world.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Be aware of your surroundings; enjoy the view from where you are. <br/>
&gt; Letterboxes are often place in areas for a certain reason, spend a <br/>
&gt; moment to consider why the placer may have chosen to share this <br/>
area <br/>
&gt; with others, by drawing them here with the lure of a letterbox find.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Survey the area for people who may be watching what you're doing. <br/>
&gt; Remember, a common activity is "people watching"... someone may be <br/>
&gt; watching you! Please don't give away the hiding spot to others who <br/>
&gt; might not share the appreciation of this activity. If you will use <br/>
&gt; care when you replace the box in it's hiding space, you can be sure <br/>
&gt; you won't contribute to a box being lost, stolen, or destroyed. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Consider that there would be no letterboxing, if there were no <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; to find. Missing boxes not only deprive other boxers of the same <br/>
&gt; sense of enjoyment you just experienced, but the person who created <br/>
&gt; the box has lost all the time they spent and sadly, may someday <br/>
&gt; choose to stop placing boxes.<br/>

If you just review some of the "discussions" on this forum alone <br/>

Yes, there's always a risk when a lot of new people join a small group<br/>
that the group's culture, it's way of life, why it exists at all, will<br/>
be overwhelmed by the new people and disappear completely.  <br/>
<br/>
Look at Gatlinburg, Tenn.<br/>
<br/>
I'm optimistic that the newbies, as I was, will stay for the sheer<br/>
enjoyment of finding the box.  Of exploring new places, finding new<br/>
views, vistas, waterfalls, lakes, and riverbends, not found on national<br/>
park maps, or in visitors' centers, and stamping the box.<br/>
<br/>
We just need to keep the integrity of this 'sport'.  It's wonderful and<br/>
the folks who stay will do so for it's enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
The note was right on.<br/>
Well Done.<br/>
