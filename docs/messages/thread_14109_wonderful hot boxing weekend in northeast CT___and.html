<br/>
Binx and I spent the past 4th of July weekend camping in W.Thompson, <br/>
CT and boxing our hearts out. (CT really IS the mother-lode!) In the <br/>
process we hit F100 with "Life in the Fast Lane" although at the time <br/>
I miscounted and thought it was "Yowie". We ended up with F148 by <br/>
Sunday and really enjoyed this area (except for the lack of free <br/>
swimming areas!). These boxes were dry and happy except as noted:<br/>
<br/>
-Quiet Moments<br/>
-The Big One (beware brave soul of the ants and PI!)<br/>
-Virginia State Stamp<br/>
-Football<br/>
-Life in the Fast Lane (F100, whoo-hooo!)<br/>
-In Search of the Yowie<br/>
-New York State Stamp<br/>
-Putnam Air Line Bridge<br/>
-Putnam Air Line Gorge<br/>
-Putnam Fitness Trail (We truly believe that the first 3 boxes are <br/>
missing although others had been through about 2 weeks before us and <br/>
didn't mention anything in the last two log books. We found what <br/>
appeared to be their resting places but no boxes...)<br/>
-Troop 25<br/>
-Bridge Over Troubled Waters<br/>
-St. Louis Cardinals<br/>
-Gone Fishing<br/>
-Windham Trust Duck Pond<br/>
-Golden Hill Trail<br/>
-Ravine Trail<br/>
-Beaver Pond Trail<br/>
-Wappoquia Loop Trail<br/>
-Ohio State Stamp (beware the stinging nettles!)<br/>
-Pomfret Station<br/>
-Jody and Sam (:))<br/>
-Friendship<br/>
-Fawn in the Forest<br/>
-Mashamoquet Meadow<br/>
-We the People<br/>
-Jumble (WOW!)<br/>
-Camera and Film<br/>
-Table Rock<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to all who placed these boxes. We had a great time <br/>
finding them and enjoying the woods and wildlife. We couldn't help <br/>
but move slowly and enjoy it all with the hot weather and all. That <br/>
oak tree was just incredible (you know which one I mean if you've <br/>
seen it!). Sadly, no exchanges for us yet but we haven't lost <br/>
hope...perhaps the Wendell Forest gathering in August...<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails (we hope!),<br/>

Hey, you guys should have hung out just a little longer at Wolf Den <br/>
the other day! That was our Outback you had to pass on the way to the <br/>
outhouse! We were hoping for an exchange, too, but just couldn't move <br/>
any faster in that heat! :-) Congrats on reaching 100!!!<br/>
