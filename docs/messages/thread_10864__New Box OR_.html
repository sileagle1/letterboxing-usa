                    <html><body><p>Hi, We're The Cleveland girls.</p>
<p>The box we placed is called the Schroeder Box and was placed on Feb, 19, 2003.</p>
<p>It is in Josephine county, city of Grants Pass, state of Oregon.</p>
<p>Easy to find</p>
<p>This is our first box and we have a feeling our hiding place may need some improvement. We'll keep on trying. Directions to this box: Take Redwood Ave. from GP and turn right on Willow lane. Willow lane turns into Schroeder lane after the stop sign. Keep on Schroeder, then make a right turn into the "ball field". If you make it to the campground or the river you've gone too far. It is marked as "ball field". Pass the tennis court and head to the second ball field. From the home plate a batter would have to hit the ball approx. 125 paces over right field. As the ball rolls out there, it will see a path between the field and the campground. If the ball were to fall to the left side of that path and up to the base of the second tree to the left it might run into a surprise. Happy hunting.</p><p><br/></p><hr size="1"/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>
