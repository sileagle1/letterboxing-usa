Mattaponi trail letterbox on a fine January morning,<br/>
1/13. We managed to find York river #2, but failed to <br/>
find YR #1, after a fairly thorough search (as the <br/>
clue suggests, this box may be missing). <br/>
<br/>
We also dropped by a few other boxes at First <br/>
Landing on a run there (we've visited them before). <br/>
All seem to be doing well! <br/>
<br/>
We will be posting clues for two new First Landing boxes <br/>
that we planted on 1/14, once they're written up <br/>
(guess where sole impressions will probably turn up...)<br/>

<div>I forgot to mention, sometimes 
boxers will carry a Hitchhiker to several boxes and stamp them in but not leave 
it. Sort of a way for you to dicide which box you want to place the HH instead 
of the very next you visit. I haven't quite figured how to track my HHs yet 
because the idea is to track where it has been, and not know where it is 
waiting. That way it will always be a surprise for the next LBer.</div>
