I just wish there was a system in place that the clue could remain in the database for posterity and for counts. I would like to see the record suppressed, i.e. it doesn't show on the list of active boxes but is still available for viewing in a special archived database and still stays in a persons found statistics. But it doesn't look like LBNA is going to do this, so the next best thing would be to remove defunct boxes. <br/>

Did you read that AQ will be putting up for adoption abandoned boxes.<br/>

<br/>
"One of the things that's always bothered me were abandoned boxes from people who no longer letterbox. The boxes go missing, but the status never gets updated. Or the clues become out of date and the letterbox essentially becomes trash because nobody can ever find it. So from day one, I've always wanted to do something about those abandoned letterboxes....For all boxes that don't have an owner who has logged into AQ for one full year, I'm going to set those boxes up as being availble for adoption. Less than 1% of the boxes on AQ fit this description, and as long as you log in once a year, you're boxes won't go up for adoption. This is about people who've stopped letterboxing altogether--or at least left clues on AQ that they no longer maintain."<br/>
