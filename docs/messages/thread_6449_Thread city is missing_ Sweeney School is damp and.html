                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, the letterbox is missing.  willimantic is fine.  Just wanted <br/>
to let Leader of the Pack know that one of her great stamps (along <br/>
with every other trace of the box) seems to be out of circulation.  <br/>
Great hiding space and we dug around quite a bit, but to no avail. <br/>
<br/>
We also neatened up the sweeney school box, replaced some ziplocks and <br/>
put a new "what is letterboxing" sheet in.  The box seemed sound, so <br/>
perhaps it just hadn't been closed well.  <br/>
<br/>
Needed to get some new letterboxers some stamps and went to Wink and a <br/>
Smile on Main Street Willimantic.  Chatted with the owner who is going <br/>
out of business and wants to sell off all his stock. He gave <br/>
us some good deals and mentioned that  he's putting all Christmas <br/>
rubber stamps on sale next week.  Thought some of you might want to <br/>
check it out.    -r-<br/>
