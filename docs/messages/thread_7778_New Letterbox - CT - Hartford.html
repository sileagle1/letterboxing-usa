<br/>
The hunt for this box should be easy, short and has a nice view of<br/>
the river.  <br/>
<br/>
According to ZZ Top, what is every girl crazy about?  A sharp dressed <br/>
man.  Shouldn't that be "sharply dressed" man?   And what does that <br/>
mean?  I ramble.  Humorously, I never really liked ZZ Top that much<br/>
as a kid.  Now I'm naming letterboxes after their songs?  Very <br/>
Interesting.<br/>

Charter Oak Landing, Hartford, CT <br/>
&gt;From North of Hartford, take I-91 South to Brainard Road, exit 27.<br/>
At the end of the ramp, turn left. At the light in front of McDonald's <br/>
turn left. Follow to the next light and turn left onto Reserve Road. <br/>
Pass CT Regional Market on your left, the entrance to the park will<br/>
be on your right. <br/>

&gt;From South of Hartford, take I-91 North to exit 27, Brainard Road. <br/>
Turn left at the light and stay in the right hand lane. Go straight <br/>
through the next intersection at McDonald's. Follow to the next set<br/>
of lights and turn left onto Reserve Road. Pass CT Regional Market on <br/>
your left, the entrance to the park will be on your right.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this summer I saw about 15 bunnies as I drove in.<br/>
<br/>
Park your car at the northern end of the park.  Head in the general <br/>
direction of the children's playground.  <br/>
<br/>
You will come to a place where you need to choose a path.  There is a <br/>
paved walkway and a paved driveway.  You want the third and leftmost <br/>
option of a stone and dirt path.  <br/>
<br/>
As you head up the path you will find a bunch of coffin shaped stones <br/>
on your right.  I counted about 15 of them and a piece of Jersey <br/>
barrier.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;From the big pieces of stone keep heading down the path a short bit. <br/>
<br/>
When you reach the telephone pole next to the large metal box take 3 <br/>
big steps and look left.  The Sharp Dressed Man is under some rocks<br/>
at the bottom of the hill/levy type thing.<br/>
