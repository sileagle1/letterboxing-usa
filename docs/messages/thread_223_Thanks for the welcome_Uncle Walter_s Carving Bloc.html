                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, thanks to all for the wonderful welcome messages!  Rick and I plan to get the groundwork done by the weekend--I am thinking, since Graham originally wrote me to ask me what the C&amp;O Canal is, to plant my first box there.  Incidently, the C&amp;O Canal is a national park that goes alongside the Potomac River.  The canal itself was initiated by George Washington and today the park is really a nice place to visit.  I am thinking of setting the box on the Maryland side, at Great Falls at a location near a trail called the Billy Goat Trail, which features some of the most incredible views of the Potomac River.  I plan to put a goat on my stamp, in part because you are going to have to be a billy goat to find it!  So, Graham, as I mentioned to you in my personal note to you earlier, you're really going to have to come out here and try this one out!<br/>

Has anyone tried making stamps using Uncle Walter's Carving Block?  It's a new vinyl stamping compound made by a fellow up in Mass.  I've heard it carves into wonderful stamps--and it comes in larger pieces than erasers.  I just ordered a couple of 4"x6" blocks (for 7.65, including shipping).  He also has 2.5"X 2.5" for 2.50, 2.5"x5" for $4.50 and 9"x12" (I didn't take down the price for that).  His phone number is 800 370 0683 (ask for Walter Israel).  If anyone has tried this, let me know how it worked--otherwise stand by for my report next week!<br/>
