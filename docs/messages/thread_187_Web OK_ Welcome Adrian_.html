&gt;I still have strong doubts about the bogeyman stalker.<br/>
&gt;It seems much more likely to me that boxes are vandalized by people<br/>

<br/>
This is true Tom.  We already know that most (if not all) of the<br/>
incidents happened that way.  Thank you for pointing that out<br/>
and for helping to quash the notion (whether you intended to do<br/>
so or not) that promotion using the web or otherwise will cause<br/>
problems.<br/>
<br/>
Was the web really used to destroy a letterbox?<br/>
<br/>
I have never heard anything definitive from Julie.  What we may<br/>
have is one incident of vandalism due to web publishing, if in fact her<br/>
boxes were vandalized due to web publishing.  I guess it seems likely<br/>
that they could have been (from eliminating the other causes).<br/>
But even if that's true its only one incident.  A while back several<br/>
incidents were reported from Dartmoor supposedly caused by<br/>
the mere suggestion that we may be promoting the hobby here in<br/>
the U.S. and that as a result of that (was the fear) that people<br/>
would rain down on Dartmoor in droves and spoil things for them.<br/>
<br/>
So the answer in Dartmoor was to wreck other people's fun for<br/>
trying to get the word out.  We may end up with the same situation<br/>
here if we don't stick together and establish some sort of bulwark<br/>
against that kind of thinking.  I think we should all agree right here<br/>
and now to not buy in to that.<br/>
<br/>
I think we have still been (attempting to) operate under a misguided<br/>
and unfounded notion.  Mainly, that we have to progress in the<br/>
same manner and pretext as Dartmoor letterboxing.  Apparently,<br/>
with little use of the web Dartmoor has acquired its spoilers.<br/>
Is there record any better than ours will be?  Not likely.<br/>
<br/>
We can never reproduce what they have in England and I don't think<br/>
we should try to.  The geography is entirely different.  The<br/>
personalities,<br/>
characters and culture are entirely different.<br/>
<br/>
I think that if we give in to these unfounded concerns about web use<br/>
- unfounded concerns that we must progress in some prescribed fashion<br/>
(don't use the web,  don't put out a blurb, etc.) our fun will be<br/>
spoiled<br/>
too because these are things that we can use to make it more fun.<br/>
<br/>
So what I say is beans to that.<br/>
<br/>
The web is just another medium.  If you use the "registration process"<br/>
that Dartmoor uses you still have a record that gets shared, copied,<br/>
distributed, etc.  You end up with the same problems.  It is really no<br/>
different.  But that process will not lend well to our geography<br/>
and to the wide dispersion of our boxes and to the different systems<br/>
used to describe them.  Our maps and the internet are the only things<br/>
that tie it all together.<br/>
<br/>
I'll say this again.  We will have problems like this with or without<br/>
the web, with or without promotion and with or without maps.  The web<br/>
will not expose clues to worse people than some other medium would.<br/>
If one out of a hundred web users are vandals so are one out of a<br/>
hundred<br/>
non-web users.  So let's progress in whatever manner we want that will<br/>
generate the most fun and the most interest - that will fulfill our<br/>
goals<br/>
for the hobby here in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
What I can provide for you is web publishing and mapping.  In addition<br/>
we can move forward on the Kids Corner ideas and I am talking to Mitch<br/>
about how to do that.  I'll post something in the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
So while the notion of promotion again surfaces let's actually consider<br/>
it this time.  Let's not get sidetracked in some paranoid dillusions<br/>
that imply "cyberspace" is some sort of spiritual domain in which<br/>
bad things happen.  People make bad things happen.  They can do<br/>
it with or without an internet connection.  I know people who refuse<br/>
to buy a computer because they feel that computers are inherently evil<br/>
things!  Can you believe that?  -- That in our day and age people still<br/>
spread around (and apparently believe) that kind of superstition?<br/>
<br/>
Well, back to reality...<br/>
<br/>
Adrian's offer to come over here to do a lecture at a school is<br/>
extremely admirable.  I'm sure he would have to take considerable<br/>
time out of his schedule.  I would be very proud if he is able to<br/>
do this.  If you tell us how much the fare is Adrian, we will<br/>
be able to figure out how to split the cost or come up with a fare.<br/>
I'm not saying we can.  I think we have about 55 members and I'm<br/>
not sure how many would be willing to buck up for some kids<br/>
in Germantown, Wisconsin who they don't even know.  I think<br/>
quite a few people may be interested in helping.  So let us know<br/>
what you need.  I suppose the school may be willing to pay a<br/>
little too.  I don't know.  How rural is the school or district?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for listening to this rather long note, those of you who<br/>
read it.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
Dan<br/>
