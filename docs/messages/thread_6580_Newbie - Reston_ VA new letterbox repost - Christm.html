It's only 75 cents to drive out to Robert Simon's dream, Reston, a planned<br/>
community of work, home and play in rolling Northern Virginia among<br/>
preserved woods. These directions will take you through a creek valley of<br/>
tall trees in one of the natural areas of Reston, Virginia. From the<br/>
Beltway, I-495, take the Dulles Toll Road, route 267, west to Hunter Mill<br/>
Road. Left on Hunter Mill and right on Sunrise Valley Drive. Take the third<br/>
left onto Cross School Road. First Right on Midsummer Drive. On your left<br/>
you will come to Dayflower Court. There on the right is a small park. Park.<br/>
<br/>
Walk between the two benches down a steep path and across a gully. You'll<br/>
pass the first Christmas Tree Graveyard. Follow the path down into the woods<br/>
all the way down into woodpecker valley. Keep an ear open for Woody<br/>
Woodpecker's relatives. Yes the big ones with the red feather crowns live<br/>
here. Did you know you can tell which way is north in a forest by observing<br/>
which side the moss grows on trees? Be careful there is poison ivy around<br/>
here. You'll come to a T at the path that runs the length of this small<br/>
valley. Turn right.<br/>
<br/>
The path heads north along the narrow swath cleared of trees for the water<br/>
line. Look for tall dead trees with woodpecker holes. You'll pass a tall<br/>
manhole cover and a muddy spring. You're following a creek way off to the<br/>
side. Along the way, you will also see tall tree, split in two and way up<br/>
high. You'll come up to the creek where you should cross it and continue<br/>
following the narrow clear-cut line. Finally you'll come to a paved path.<br/>
<br/>
Cross bridge 31. Turn left over the bridge onto a dirt path leading north<br/>
along the creek again. Very soon the path will jog right and on the right,<br/>
you'll see a tall rotting tree stump. Walk around it in a U-turn and follow<br/>
the fallen tree about 15 paces to the Christmas Tree Graveyard.<br/>
