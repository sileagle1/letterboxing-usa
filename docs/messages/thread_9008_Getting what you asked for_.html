Last year I felt all alone in Maryland hiding boxes and begging for more to find. Along came an article in the Post and with it a flood of nuts. As most of you know I usually sign off with "May there be lots of nuts in your life." Well I think that has come true for all of us in the Mid-Atlantic Area. Enter Squirrels Girls ( the collective name) consisting of Psychomommy, Turtle, Apple Dumpling Gang, Fireflylight and Mudmommy. Now if that isn't a bunch of nuts I don't know what is. They have come into our lives with sillyness and lots of boxes to find and for that I am truly grateful. I got what I wished for and I hope the rest of you are enjoying this silly hobby.<br/>
<br/>
May you be a nut in someone's life,<br/>

 Just wanted to say thanks to The Squirrels Girls for<br/>
all thier hard work in planting in the MD area. I<br/>
still consider myself new to LB and am excited at the<br/>
possible opportunities that await when I have the<br/>
time. I am chomping to get out and use my new<br/>
signature stamp that has more to do with my login name<br/>
than my first stamp.  Would it be too wierd to revisit<br/>
boxes just to reenter? I am even carving for my son<br/>
and husband for when the come along.  I am hooked,<br/>
just not getting out as much as I wish.  Thanks again<br/>
for all your work and fun attitude.  It is contagious.<br/>
