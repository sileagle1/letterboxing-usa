                    <div class="plaintext-content">We love to use the **Master Carve blocks. Unfortunately it is a bit <br/>
expensive. We also regularly use the **"pink stuff" from Speedball <br/>
and have had good luck with it.  I prefer using the pink and placing <br/>
a dab of super glue on the back...mounting it to the cover of our ink <br/>
pads. Makes for a cheap and easy mounting block and <br/>
reduces "letterboxers fingertips" (grin).  <br/>
<br/>
The recent philosophy we've had with regards to MasterCarve is <br/>
this... it is great to carve, and easy to work with.  The cost, <br/>
however, we don't feel is worth it on certain boxes.  As Jay Drew has <br/>
mentioned, he currently has over 50 boxes missing, vandalized, etc.  <br/>
If I think the placement location is at all likely to get vandalized <br/>
or destroyed by a non-LB finder, I use the pink stuff.   I save the <br/>
MasterCarve for places like Avery Tract, CT - where the land use is <br/>
fairly restricted and has lower traffic and lower likelihood of <br/>
accidental finding.  <br/>
<br/>
I also found some great **erasers at Christmas Tree Shoppes in <br/>
Warwick RI. 2 erasers in a package for $0.69. Last time up there, <br/>
Heidi bought the store out!  They are nice and flat - unlike the ones <br/>
Wal-Mart sells which have a little Spartan-headed pattern on them <br/>
that will mess up your image.  I've carved a number of stamps on <br/>
these erasers and have had good luck as well. <br/>
<br/>
**Tools: Started out with a straight razor blade...then to Exacto... <br/>
now using the Speedball cutters.  Also still use the Xacto for <br/>
certain cuts. I know a few folks use scalpels for fine detail also.  <br/>
Its up to you! <br/>
