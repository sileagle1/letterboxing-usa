I will definately check in on your box.  what is the box name? I have two weeks in Europe and I have purposefully planned to have No ITINERARY :)  I speak french so french clues should not be a problem.  I was mostly concerned with translating the clues from german to english but every one has provided fantastic suggestions.  Thanks All<br/>
