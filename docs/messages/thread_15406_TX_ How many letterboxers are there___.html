                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have wondered for about a month, and tried to find out from <br/>
several other sources, a very rough figure for the number of active <br/>
letterboxers in Texas. From what I can 'see' there aren't very many. <br/>
Although I realize that not all letterboxers post on here, or even <br/>
join the group, or make themselves known, I can only 'count' about <br/>
18! Now there are bound to be more than that, I would hope... And as <br/>
for letterboxes hidden, there are approximately 137 according to the <br/>
listings. That may sound like a pretty good number, but those boxes <br/>
are scattered over a very large area. <br/>
<br/>
Currently, I have placed 11 letterboxes around my area, but I don't <br/>
think there are any letterboxers near enough to even come find them! <br/>
I know of a few who are thinking of making plans to come to the area <br/>
in the months ahead, but it really seems futile to make and place <br/>
more boxes if there aren't people who are going to search for them. <br/>
The boxes, placed by others, that I have found, in South Texas, have <br/>
few signatures in them, and they have been placed for 8 and 9 months.<br/>
<br/>
If you live in Texas, please post and let the rest of us Texans know <br/>
you are out there... or email me. I would really like to eventually <br/>
have more letterboxes to find, or even to have gatherings and events <br/>
like the northern letterboxers do.<br/>

We aren't in Texas, but don't get discouraged. When Gwen &amp; I started <br/>
playing there were only 14 letterboxes in California. Now I realize <br/>
that Texas is really big, but we to had to travel a long way to get a <br/>
stamp. Some very wise Letterboxer said"Plant them and they will <br/>
come".Indeed they will. Don<br/>

When I started a year ago there were less than 5, so it is slowly<br/>
catching on.  Baby Bear and I have struggled with this all year<br/>
and can't think of a good way to "recruit" new boxers.  Very few<br/>
have embraced letterboxing after we explain it and word of mouth<br/>
is very slow.  Recent magazine articles have helped.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; for letterboxes hidden, there are approximately 137 according to <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; listings. That may sound like a pretty good number, but those boxes <br/>
&gt; are scattered over a very large area.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I purposely place my letterboxes over as wide an area of Texas<br/>
as I can so potential letterboxers in other parts of the state<br/>
will have a chance to go after at least one and get "hooked".<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Currently, I have placed 11 letterboxes around my area, but I don't <br/>
&gt; think there are any letterboxers near enough to even come find <br/>
them! <br/>
&gt; I know of a few who are thinking of making plans to come to the <br/>
area <br/>
&gt; in the months ahead, but it really seems futile to make and place <br/>
&gt; more boxes if there aren't people who are going to search for them. <br/>
&gt; The boxes, placed by others, that I have found, in South Texas, <br/>
have few signatures in them, and they have been placed for 8 and 9 <br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That is great you have placed 11 boxes in your area, but maybe<br/>
you could start placing some further away so others (like me)<br/>
can go after them easier.  You can even start placing and finding<br/>
boxes in other states as part of a regular vacation.  On recent<br/>
trips, I have incorporated letterboxing with vacation plans<br/>
when I could and it took us to some great places I had never<br/>
heard of before.  We are blessed with a big state<br/>
so traveling long distances is a fact of life for us.  I look<br/>
at it as an opportunity to see parts of our state that I have<br/>
never been to or as a chance to revisit places I have been before.<br/>
Plus, if others ever do start participating, Texas has more space<br/>
for letterboxes than almost any other state!  Even though<br/>
we may not have trails as scenic as other states, we have<br/>
great parks and historical places.  I have used this as a<br/>
way to get Texans out to experience their heritage while <br/>
having fun letterboxing.  All we can do is set the table<br/>
and hope our "guests" come to dinner soon. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you live in Texas, please post and let the rest of us Texans <br/>
know <br/>

Baby Bear and I have toyed with the idea of having a First <br/>
Texas Letterboxing Event, maybe this winter.  It would be<br/>
great to see how many Texas letterboxers there are and if<br/>
they would be interested in such an event.<br/>

will be unavailable for a few more months--I know that they would <br/>
LOVE to participate in any TX LB event that you plan--perhaps <br/>
something in Austin would work out well?  At least the rattlers will <br/>
be hibernating by then (at least we hope so) if you plan on <br/>
something in the Winter.  When I lived in that area way back when <br/>
(93-96, 98-00), I came across those things WAY more often than I <br/>
cared to.  I can certainly imagine that letterboxing is a big <br/>
adventure in them thar parts of the country with those slithering <br/>
additional obstacles.  ;)  Keep up the great work!  When I tell <br/>
people about letterboxing, I get 2 responses:<br/>
1.  "That's so cool, how can I start?"<br/>
2.  "You must be INSANE, now why would you ever waste your time like <br/>
that?"  <br/>
<br/>
I just assume the folks with the first response are cool people!<br/>

<br/>
My family are new letterboxers, and there are four of<br/>
us.  The kids and I (15 yo girl and 7 yo boy) have<br/>
been out a couple of times, and slowly but surely,<br/>
we've sucked my husband in too!  I knew it was only a<br/>
matter of time - he loves hiking and wilderness - how<br/>
could he NOT like letterboxing?  <br/>
<br/>
We are in Northeast Texas and we are planning on<br/>
making a day of it Monday.  We want to hit Silver<br/>
Eagle and Baby Bear's boxes in the Rusk/Alto/Palestine<br/>
areas, and maybe even down to Crockett.  We have spent<br/>
tons of time tramping around Mission Tejas, the Texas<br/>
State Railroad, most of the woods around here - and to<br/>
think that they've been sneaking around placing boxes<br/>
right in our stomping ground! <br/>
<br/>
We also have several really good ideas of places to<br/>
hide some boxes, but we need to get the stamp carving<br/>
process down pretty good before we try to place too<br/>
many.  <br/>
<br/>
So count us on your list, Wanda!<br/>
