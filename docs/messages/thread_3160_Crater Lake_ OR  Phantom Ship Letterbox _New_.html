Crater Lake, OR<br/>
Planted: 8/24/01<br/>
By: Amanda from Seattle<br/>
<br/>
Crater Lake is located in Southern Oregon.  The letterbox is located <br/>
on the Sun Notch trail.  The Sun Notch Trail is accessible from the <br/>
Rim Drive.  The Rim Drive is a 33-mile road that encircles the Lake.  <br/>
The north entrance to Crater Lake and the Rim Drive are closed from <br/>
mid-October to late June.<br/>
<br/>
The Sun Notch Trail is a short .5 mile stroll that overlooks Crater <br/>
Lake and the Island called Phantom Ship.<br/>
The Island  seems to disappear and reappear depending on the light <br/>
and shadow on the lakethus the name Phantom Ship.  <br/>
<br/>
You can park your car in the turnout  at the Sun Notch Trailhead.  <br/>
Start along the trail as it leads through thick woods and a meadow.  <br/>
When the trail forks, go to the right.  When you have to make another <br/>
decision, go approx. 30 degrees to the right  for the best views of <br/>
the Phantom Ship.<br/>
<br/>
To get the letterbox, Backtrack and instead of returning to the <br/>
parking lot, continue Southwest (220 degrees).  When you see a lone <br/>
tree on your left at the edge of the trail start to count your <br/>
steps.  8 steps past this tree, look to your right  (300 degrees).  <br/>
There should be a cluster of snags. (very large trees with no tops) <br/>
on the edge of the cliff.  The Letterbox is under the large snag on <br/>
the lake side. It is hidden in a crevice, covered by bark and twigs   <br/>
Please use caution at the edge of the cliff.   The cliff edges are <br/>
unstable.  <br/>
<br/>
The trail circles around to the parking lot.  <br/>
I planted this letterbox in August 2001, if you are searching for it <br/>
2002 or later, please let me know if there have been changes to the <br/>
topography of the trail. (perhaps the trail winds around the other <br/>
side of the lone tree---it would be on your right instead of your <br/>
left).<br/>
<br/>
This is a busy park in the summer, so be discreet.<br/>
<br/>
Please replace the box as found or better! And don't forget to read <br/>
the waiver of responsibility and disclaimer.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Amanda from Seattle<br/>

<br/>
WOW!  You found Colliding Rivers!!!  I was wondering if anyone was going<br/>
to find that box!  I'm so glad you were the first!  That one was tough<br/>
to hide.  We looked for several places in that area and the first place<br/>
I put it seemed too dangerous.  Other places were too obvious.  I'm sure<br/>
glad to know it's still there.  As for Wolf Creek, when I get down that<br/>
way again I'll have to check it out.  It's kind of up and under<br/>
something as I recall.  Anyway, I'm glad you got that Colliding Rivers<br/>
stamp image.  I loved carving that one.  And even though Wolf Creek<br/>
wasn't there for you, I hope you enjoyed the hike and the falls.  <br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear you put one at Crater Lake.  I'd like to get down there,<br/>
but don't know when that will happen.  There has been talk that the<br/>
National Park Service monitors LBNA's website and removes letterboxes<br/>
placed within the national park system, so if your box turns up missing<br/>
at some point in the future, that may be why.  Thanks for the update on<br/>
my Glide boxes!<br/>
<br/>
