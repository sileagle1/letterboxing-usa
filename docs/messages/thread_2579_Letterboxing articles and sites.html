                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been trying to update my list of letterboxing related links on <br/>
the Letterboxing International site. I have found several new <br/>
articles and sites over the last few days, and some visitors to the <br/>
site have also been kind enough to suggest some that I have missed <br/>
thus far. If anyone knows of some letterboxing articles online or <br/>
letterboxing related information sites (apart from just individual <br/>
clue lists) you would like to suggest, please contact me off list. <br/>
Thanks much, and hopefully some of the links may be of interest to <br/>
others.<br/>
