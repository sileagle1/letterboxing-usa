Adirondacks which is at Ft. Ticonderoga.  Actually my<br/>
kids and parents picked that one up yesterday- it's in<br/>
good shape.  The Crown Point box appears to be<br/>
missing- they went twice looking for it and didn't<br/>
find it.  There is some work going on in the Fort and<br/>
it is suspected that the box is either in that area or<br/>
has been discovered and removed. Ya just might find a<br/>
surprise there if you want to venture into Ticonderoga<br/>
(hint?).<br/>
<br/>
There is a box in Glenville, I believe, which is<br/>
outside the park, nearer to Schenectady.  Eric the Ram<br/>
is supposed to be in Saratoga (planting boxes, we<br/>
hope?) this week or next.  Fingers crossed.<br/>
<br/>
I'm still unpacking from my move and haven't gotten<br/>
the chance to visit the ADKs to plant any though they<br/>
are formulating in my mind.<br/>

&gt; Are there any boxes in the Adirondack area of NY?<br/>
&gt; According to the Lbna there <br/>
&gt; isn't, but there could be a mystery or travelling<br/>
&gt; box. If you have knowledge <br/>
&gt; of one, please contact me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you.<br/>
