I am carving an elephant... How do I make sure his eyes, tusks and ear<br/>

This stamp is a SMALL one... it is 1x1", so needless to say, I need to<br/>

a bigger stamp, but hey, I am one for challenges!  LOL<br/>

&gt; My best suggestion is to GO SLOW!!! Think and Rethink how you want <br/>
it to look, and go  from there- if you mess it up you can always <br/>
start over, especially since it's a small one :0)-Sunshine <br/>
