&gt; &gt; Mohmers, was it on TV or radio?  I just did a search on the keyword<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing in Lexis Nexis, looking for articles in U.S. newspapers and<br/>
&gt; &gt; magazines during the past six months, but nothing turned up.  Would love <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; know if it has gotten any coverage!  BTW, I queried Yankee magazine <br/>
&gt;recently<br/>
&gt; &gt; about doing an article on New England letterboxing but they were not<br/>
&gt; &gt; interested :-(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I've gotten alot of queries recently from people who say they have read<br/>
&gt;about letterboxing in "Orion Magazine".  I haven't had time to look<br/>
&gt;further, so if someone else has the time and interest, there it is.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This thread reminds me that my FAQ was supposedly edited and<br/>
published in some NJ homeschool magazine.  I asked the <br/>
author/editor/whatever, as condition for using it, just to<br/>
send me a copy of the magazine for my files and give me a<br/>
writer's acknowledgement, but unfortunately she never did <br/>
(send me a copy anyway), and never returned any of my <br/>
followup e-mails on the matter either.  A rather disappointing<br/>
episode, unfortunately.  (Not that the FAQ is great work of<br/>
art or anything, but I originally wrote it at the request of, and<br/>
for publication, in this thing).<br/>
<br/>
So, if anyone ever sees some NJ homeschool-like magazine <br/>
floating around with an article about letterboxing that looks<br/>
like my FAQ, let me know :-)<br/>
