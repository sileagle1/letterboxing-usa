<br/>
I would say that you should contact the placer first.  This is a really nice <br/>
thing for you to offer to do.  I live in Connecticut but have boxes in Ohio, <br/>
San Fransisco, New Jersey, Nova Scotia, PEI, New Hampshire...  obviously, I <br/>
can't go running up to PEI if someone says that something is wrong with my <br/>
Panorama Park box.  (Although I'd be grateful for the excuse...)<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah, contact the placer and see what they say.  Chances are they'll be <br/>
really happy to hear from you and that their box is alive and well.  They may <br/>
ask you to send them the full logbook.  In the meantime, a good idea would be <br/>
to go drop off some blank index cards so that other finders have something to <br/>
stamp on. :)  If there's enough room in the container, it wouldn't be against <br/>
the rules to add an entirely new book.  The only thing is, don't remove the <br/>
original without permission from the placer.  (Does this make sense?)<br/>

your replacing the logbook and mailing it to them.  They may even mail you a<br/>

<br/>
You can, and should, certainly make minor repairs like replacing baggies if<br/>
you have the material with you to do it (a lot of letterboxers carry first<br/>
aid stuff with them).  I take extra logbooks in case I find a box without<br/>
one (or if I know the placer and know they would be okay with it, I would<br/>
replace a full one too).<br/>
<br/>
As long as you aren't changing the creative bent of the box or the location,<br/>
anything you would do to return a box to a proper condition or to correct a<br/>
deficiency (like no logbook) is usually appreciated.  Just remember though -<br/>
mail the placer the logbook since it is a record of the history of their<br/>
box.<br/>

but I just wanted to add a question. <br/>
<br/>
Is the logbook really full?  I don't consider a logbook full until<br/>
every side of every page is full of stamps including the covers. I<br/>
personally love to find an old log and look at all the stamps and<br/>
comments in it and like to give other boxers that opportunity.  I have<br/>
frequently gotten notices about full logbooks and then don't replace<br/>
them since there is plenty more room.    <br/>

 The funniest thing that happened was I placed a special one-of-a-kind-binding log into a box and then I found that same log being used in someone else's hitchhiker.<br/>

 I know I've gone through 50-100 baggies re-vamping boxes this year. I've rescued more than one that were scattered on the ground.<br/>

<br/>
This definitely would not float *my* boat.   My containers aren't really<br/>
large enough to fit a zillion pages in the logbook, so I do have to change<br/>
logbooks occasionally in the boxes.  But I really prefer it when people<br/>
stamp only one individual's or family's stamps to a page and only on one<br/>
side of the paper. (If a family is boxing with 5 family members and all 5<br/>
have their own stamps, then it's nice to see them all on one page if<br/>
possible to not waste too many logbook pages.)<br/>
<br/>
I like the stamps to be only on one side of the paper because once I *do*<br/>
replace the logbook, I like to take the logbook apart and put the pages in a<br/>
scrapbook.  Can't really do that if the stamps are on both sides of the<br/>
page.  Well, ya can, but half the stamps won't show then.  In those cases,<br/>
I'll often cut the scrapbook page and have it work like a mat, so that both<br/>
sides will show.  But that's a lot of work.<br/>
<br/>
Also, depending on the thickness of the paper and the thickness of the ink,<br/>
there can be a lot of bleed-thru so that it's difficult to distinguish one<br/>
stamp from another or one comment from another.<br/>
<br/>
Also once a bunch of stamps and comments clutter up each page, it can be<br/>
difficult to determine which stamps go to which trail names and to which<br/>
comments.  There are stamps and names that I see over and over again, and<br/>
those are easy to distinguish what stamp goes with what trailname, but there<br/>
are a lot of others that aren't familiar.<br/>

sent me a logbook to replace that one when I was in that area again, so when<br/>
I returned with my son we couldn't even find a place for him to stamp in<br/>
before we took the old book - he couldn't stamp in until we put the new book<br/>
into the box.  I got to take the old one with me and peruse it before I sent<br/>
it to Silver Eagle.  What fun to see a logbook that has been in a box since<br/>
it started and has every square inch filled up!<br/>

This is how it's done for the log books we've seen so far (only six!), and it seems a shame when someone stamps on the back of a page and it bleeds through.  I like to be able to see everyone's stamp and what they've written.<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering if this is regional at all?  Maybe Portland letterboxers are one-page-per, and other areas are more likely to fill a book completely?<br/>

Just today, I got a logbook in the mail from my friend Knitica.  Not<br/>
only did she dry out my letterbox that had been underwater in the<br/>
recent flooding in NY, but she carved a custom stamp incorporating my<br/>
signature image and hers and stamped that image on the front page of<br/>
the new logbook.  (My original stamp is undisturbed.)<br/>

Utterly delightful!<br/>
