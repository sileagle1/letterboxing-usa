<br/>
Start at the parking lot for the trailhead for the trail along the <br/>
creek in the watershed that has been called the "Galapagos of <br/>
Texas."  (There are many trailheads and parking lots.  You want the <br/>
one on the south side of the creek, off of the highway that calls <br/>
itself a circle but isn't.)<br/>
<br/>
Start at the wide dirt trail behind the information kiosk.  After a <br/>
couple of minutes' walk, the trail ends in a T-junction.  Turn right <br/>
(east by compass), then at the creek, turn left to follow the creek <br/>
downstream. If you visit after a rainy spell, the trail will <br/>
occasionally be muddy from runoff from springs bubbling up out of <br/>
the hillside to your left.  After about 10-15 minutes' walk, trail <br/>
crosses under the aforementioned inaptly named highway, and then <br/>
creekbed broadens into a wide, deeply eroded limestone bed, at the <br/>
end of which is a small waterfall and a nice swimming hole.  There <br/>
will be a parking lot directly across from you.<br/>
<br/>
Look for (and step around) a tangle of rusty barbed wire along the <br/>
trail on which you are walking.  If the barbed wire has been cleaned <br/>
up, an alternative landmark is a pair of trash cans directly across <br/>
from you on the opposite side of the creek, in the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Take 120 steps along the trail downstream.  This should bring you to <br/>
a point where the trail makes a quick dogleg to the left on a flat <br/>
outcrop of limestone.  41 steps beyond this, you will see a path <br/>
leading uphill to your left.  A single metal fencepost, supporting <br/>
some barbed wire and painted orange, is on the left about half way <br/>
up.  The path ends in a T junction with a wide trail that crosses a <br/>
meadow beneath some steep cliffs.  <br/>
<br/>
Turn left onto the trail and proceed 52 steps.  You will encounter a <br/>
spur that departs the main trail on a heading of 350 degrees.  Take <br/>
80 steps along this spur, at which point you should be looking at a <br/>
(usually dry) stream cut ravine heading downhill from your right to <br/>
your left.  Before descending more than a few steps into the ravine, <br/>
turn right on a heading of 100 degrees and carefully walk uphill, <br/>
along the left side of six twisted strands of barbed wire that rise <br/>
out of the ground to form an old fence line.  The wire is attached <br/>
to a tree with a hollow base, in which you will find the letterbox.<br/>
