<br/>
Today is my first time on the group -- and my first actual day <br/>
letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
I found the box at Orenaug Park, Woodbury, Ct. Rubaduc, perfect <br/>
directions! I had my kids with me, so I thought a trail I was <br/>
familiar with was my best bet.<br/>
<br/>
The box was in perfect condition.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to many more boxes ahead of me!<br/>

Oh, I've already spent hours today looking at sites. I'm trying to <br/>
keep the hikes simple for now -- my kids are still kinda young.  <br/>

Gee, thanks! I'm already reading some of the mysteries and <br/>
thinking "hey, I can figure this out.. eventually!"<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the welcome!<br/>

I've been letterboxing for about 14 months now, and almost 900 boxes <br/>
later......  Yes, my boyfriend Eric (True Soccer Fan) does feel that I need a 12 step <br/>
program.  I'm trying to get him out boxing tomorrow, however, with his 12 hour <br/>
a day work load, that may be impossible.  I do know that I'm going to solve a <br/>
Dilemma on Monday, and find a Tulip, Rhododendron, perhaps an old Oak tree, <br/>
and find a really cool Glacial Erratic (btw... the process of how the Glacial <br/>
Erratics got to where they are is called Glaciation... True Soccer Fan taught <br/>
me that!).<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting to old and new fans!<br/>

Welcome to this addictive and fun sport! I know you'll love it as much as we <br/>
all do!<br/>
 Next time you post on this website, it's customary to include the two-letter <br/>
state abbreviation you're posting about. That way, the CA folks can weed out <br/>
the IDs and the MAs if we want and everyone else can delete us CAs!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
