You might be waiting by your mailbox awhile, because the list to <br/>

I will accept any rules that you feel necessary to your freedom. I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do. - Professor Bernardo de la Paz,  The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress<br/>
