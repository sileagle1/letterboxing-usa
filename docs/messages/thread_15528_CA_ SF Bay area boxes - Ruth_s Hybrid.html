&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ruth's Hybrid (we found out later we were looking in the wrong place)<br/>
<br/>
I was in San Francisco just last week looking for this geochache/letterbox.  I'm pretty <br/>
sure I was in the right place as I had the GPS coordinates which made it pretty easy to <br/>
find - also, I did find the 5 yellow poles from the clue as well as the gate.  However, <br/>
there was nothing there (amidst a bunch of rubbish) that appeared to be a letterbox <br/>
or a geocache.  I sent a message to the placer using the link from the clue, but no <br/>
response so far.  Also, I noticed that the listing of this box on the geocache site is <br/>
now gone (it used to be there too).  If the placer is a subscriber to this board, could <br/>
they please let us know the status?<br/>
