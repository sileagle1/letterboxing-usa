<br/>
I went out today to do your Saw Mill mystery box but had some trouble <br/>
finding the right rock mentioned in the clue. (needless to say I did <br/>
not find the letterbox.) we seemed to be in the correct location as <br/>
best we could tell.  I would like to ask you a few questions about <br/>
the rock but do not want to post on here as to not give anything <br/>
away.  would you mind emailing me with your email address so I can <br/>
ask you a few questions about this box location?<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
