Warren County,Hackettstown<br/>
moderate climb, allow 2 hours<br/>
Directions: on 517 between Rt 80 and Hackettstown. From Rt80 pass<br/>
Mattars Restaurant on the right and then look for small green street<br/>
sign that reads Deer Pond Park Road on the left. Follow this lane for<br/>
almost 2 miles ,going past outhouses and resident lot, till you can't go<br/>
any further.We got to parking lot #1 and then hiked through the gate to<br/>
parking lot #2 where there is a map posted. Your search will be the<br/>
white trail along the pond to the pink overlook trail. Come back the<br/>
same way unless you are adventurous and can memorize the map. Check out<br/>
the beaver activity as you walk along the pond. Just before the<br/>
dam/bridge and by the sign that reads Weight Limit 20 Ton, take the well<br/>
worn pink trail on your right. Bear left at the fork and continue its<br/>
steady climb to the pinnacle.<br/>

Moderate 1 hour climb, or this could be combined with Marty's Mt.<br/>
Tammany box for a strenuous 1/2 day hike.<br/>
Directions: Rt. 80W to exit for Rest Area and Picnic, just before the<br/>
last exit in NJ.  Pull into the second parking lot with a sign<br/>
Worthington State Park Dunefield Creek. Any questions just go to the<br/>
visitor center which is interesting anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Start on the AT white trail and then bear right onto the green<br/>
Dunnefield Creek trail. After finding this box you could pick up the<br/>
blue trail right there for the strenuous hike up to the Mt. Tammany box.<br/>
<br/>
Clues for the BENCH BOX BLUES<br/>
      to be sung with a blues tune<br/>
<br/>
If you're down and out,<br/>
      with no place to go<br/>
Take a walk on the  white side<br/>
       where you can hike slow.<br/>
<br/>
Pick up the green trail<br/>
       following the falls.<br/>
Look for the bench  <br/>
        that beckons and calls.<br/>
<br/>
After a rest<br/>
        at 120 degrees<br/>
Take 50 paces<br/>
        into the trees<br/>
<br/>
Look under a stone ledge<br/>
        there you will poke.<br/>
What you came for <br/>
         is no joke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
