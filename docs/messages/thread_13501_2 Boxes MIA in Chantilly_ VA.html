Hi!  I went in search for two boxes that were planted in eleanor c. <br/>
lawrence park in chantilly, va and could not find either of <br/>
them...one was supposed to be on the ground near a root system of a <br/>
fallen over tree...the other, behind a birdhouse between a cluster of <br/>
three pine trees....has anyone else been able to find these and not <br/>
find them?  Did I not look hard enough or have the boxes been removed <br/>
or are they just missing?  Any one have any ideas? <br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are actually 4 boxes in that park, it's just that the planters <br/>
called the parks by different names and two said it was in Centreville <br/>
and two said it was in Chantilly. Ellanor C. Lawrence, Bump on a Log <br/>
and Two Birders letterboxes are all in the same park.  For Two <br/>
Birders, the clue page says the link doesn't work.  Maybe someone out <br/>
there has a copy of the clues and can help out.  And Bump on a Log <br/>
doesn't tell you how to get to the park because that info didn't <br/>
transfer.  <br/>
<br/>
I found all 4 boxes in October or November.  Sorry, but that's the <br/>
closest (calendar wise) that I can get you.  The one under the pine <br/>
tree may have been caught up in the spring flood because it's on flat <br/>
land not too far from the creek.  The one under the roots should have <br/>
been safe from floods.  Did you notice the bench in front of the tree?  <br/>
It had rubber stamp images on it when I was there.  Subtle, huh?  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
