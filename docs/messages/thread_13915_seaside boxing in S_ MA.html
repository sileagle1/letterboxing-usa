<br/>
Binx and I decided to attack the two "Seaside Letterboxes" series <br/>
tail-first yesterday beginning with a wonderful day trip to Cuttyhunk <br/>
Island via ferry. I highly recommend this excursion to all! Many <br/>
thanks to the Yachtsman, Mary Manatee, and Catnapper for placing <br/>
these boxes, both dry and intact:<br/>
<br/>
-CH 400<br/>
-Church's Beach (our first first find!)<br/>
<br/>
We continued boxing in the late afternoon after returning to New <br/>
Bedford. Here are the day's results:<br/>
<br/>
-The Slugger (box was lying just out in the woods behind the rockpile <br/>
but was intact)<br/>
-Old Landing<br/>
-Island Wharf (Box was wet inside and log book was soaked partially. <br/>
We tried best we could to wrap the wet pages in paper towels but the <br/>
book should be dried out properly...many stamps are already runny or <br/>
obliterated.)<br/>
<br/>
We couldn't get to Ft. Phoenix due to sunbathers RIGHT in front of <br/>
the hiding spot. Dunseith Garden *appears* to be missing...we found <br/>
the wall no prob and what looked like what used to be the resting <br/>
place of a squarish object under a rock. Hopefully we simply missed <br/>
it...can someone verify this box to the list if they find it in the <br/>
next few weeks? We'll email the placers as well. There were simply <br/>
too many people at Silvershell Beach for us to feel comfortable <br/>
retrieving the box. We didn't attempt Walk Softly as it was getting <br/>
late.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest, for those of you planning to find some of these series, <br/>
that you pick your times/dates carefully. Many really are in public <br/>
view and should be saved for later evening, early morning, and/or off-<br/>
season...or you'll end up waiting in your car muttering "Why do they <br/>
have to play catch RIGHT THERE!" like we were. :)<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails!<br/>
