&gt; Thanks to the many who posted about finding a hitcher in your <br/>
own <br/>
&gt; box.  I found the Phoenix hitcher in our Loonerism box quite a <br/>
while <br/>
&gt; ago and since it was our first hitcher foun I could not bring <br/>
myself <br/>
&gt; to leave it there.  I felt guilty for a while about taking it but <br/>
&gt; felt as most do that a find is a find no matter whose box you <br/>
find it <br/>
&gt; in.  <br/>

<br/>
This subject came up a few months back. Can't remember exactly when, though. I do remember that the verdict seemed to be that it would count as a find. Which, when you think about it, does make sense. I think it wouldn't count as a find, though, if you leave a HH in one of your own boxes, and then come back to check on it some time later, and the HH is still there. That happened to us about a month ago.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">      Funny you should ask this question.  I've come across my own <br/>
hitchhikers about half a dozen times both in my own boxes and in <br/>
other peoples' boxes.  I even came across one of my sister's <br/>
hitchhiking letterboxes that I had previously found in somebody <br/>
else's box.  In those instances where it was my second acquaintance <br/>
with the hitchhiking letterbox, I did not claim it as a found <br/>
letterbox nor did I move it to a new location.  <br/>
<br/>
     Along the same lines, I have had the awesome opportunity to <br/>
exchange stamps with other letterboxers.  On two occasions, those <br/>
individuals changed their signature stamps and I had the privilege <br/>
to receive their new signature stamp during a subsequent meeting.  <br/>
In those two cases, I didn't count the newly exchanged signature <br/>
stamps as exchanges because I hadn't formally given them a new <br/>
signature stamp from me (i.e. no 'exchange' of stamps between the <br/>
two of us occurred--in that situation it was a one-sided event and <br/>
thus IMHO not an 'official' exchange--others might feel differently <br/>
about this but that's the beauty of this hobby--there are no set <br/>
rules).<br/>
<br/>
Have a great Thanksgiving &amp; happy letterboxing!!!<br/>

&gt; Which, when you think about it, does make sense. I think it wouldn't count as<br/>
&gt; a find, though, if you leave a HH in one of your own boxes, and then come<br/>
&gt; back to check on it some time later, and the HH is still there. That happened<br/>
&gt; to us about a month ago.<br/>
<br/>
I did come up before.  A HH is a box without clues -- therefore finding it<br/>
is mostly blind luck (with many notable exceptions, of course), so where ever<br/>
you find it, even if in your own box, it should count.  You have basically<br/>
solved the clue and found a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
As to the second question, I don't think a box should be counted more than<br/>
once unless all of: the clues, location, and stamp, have changed.  In the <br/>
case mentioned above, you can tell by the logbook if the location has changed <br/>
(moving and coming back in my mind counts as a change), and if the stamp has<br/>
changed.  The clue, tho, prolly hasn't changed (it remains the null clue),<br/>
but it is possible a "hint" was made available since the first time you found<br/>
it and the second time you found it -- this would be a clue change.  So, <br/>
in general, unless it moved and came back with a different stamp, and there<br/>
was some clue that this happened, I would not count it the second time.  JMHO.<br/>
