told about her day of boxing !! I looked all afternoon yesterday and<br/>
into the night. Again this morning.  Nothing. !! I am sure many are<br/>
wondering if she did indeed get her 700th box.  I know her boxing days<br/>
are always full and many boxes find there way into her hands. Yesterday,<br/>
she did indeed get her 700th box, at a cave, as I promised , it was a<br/>
great hike  and lots of wonderful rocks.  From there our luck sort of<br/>
went down hill !! But there in lies the probable reason of no exciting<br/>
post from her. A day of boxing with a total count of four, is not the<br/>
usual Music Woman's day. Pomfret here we come !!<br/>

Yes, I indeed found my 700th box yesterday at a cave!  Coginchaug (sp?) Cave <br/>
to be exact.  We then found Katie, (Riley), and XMP's first series.  Then it <br/>
went downhill.  We went to find Who Let the Dogs Out, and we think we checked <br/>
every rock in the park, with no success.  After that, Stephanie and Butterfly <br/>
went home, and I went on to Trail of Terror (not!).  I was successful in <br/>
finding #1, but couldn't figure out a way to get to #2 without bushwacking through <br/>
briars.... and a snake kept me from #3, since it was right in my path while <br/>
bushwacking.  (I really do not like snakes!).  I then went on to Golden Thread to <br/>
find many people in the parking lot.... (sigh.....).  I stayed around for a <br/>
bit to see if the people would leave, however to no avail.  At that point, I <br/>
decided that I had better get to the music store before it closes, and get home <br/>
to eat before rehearsal!<br/>
<br/>
Oh well!  I'm hoping that Pomfret on Saturday will be much more fruitful!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Butterfly and Stephanie for a nice day!<br/>
