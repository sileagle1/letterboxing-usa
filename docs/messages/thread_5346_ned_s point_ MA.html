at 6'-5" my paces are really big!).  but we searched a<br/>
large section of the seawall in the 35-pace range and<br/>
found... a geocache!  it was my first geocache and we<br/>
left a precious bauble (a kittansett golf course<br/>
greens pick that i found in my father-in-laws car) and<br/>
had fun--too bad gc-ing requires an expensive gps<br/>
gizzmo.<br/>
<br/>
is the ned's point lighthouse letterbox missing, or am<br/>
i just a dunce with a compass?  (what IS the magnetic<br/>
declination in massachusetts, anyway?)<br/>

Tig and I also are!  You found as we did back in<br/>
March, that the box is apparently missing.  Someone<br/>
had said earlier that they thought the sea wall had<br/>
been reworked and perhaps there lies our problem with<br/>
being in the parking lot rather than the wall?  We<br/>
also found the geocache, our first, but took and left<br/>
nothing.  Not sure if geocaching is for me, yet. :o)<br/>
