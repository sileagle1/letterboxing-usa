&gt; While I haven't yet officially started letterboxing, I am an avid <br/>
geocacher<br/>
&gt; and have happened upon letterboxes in my cache searching.  <br/>
(It's always<br/>
&gt; exciting to find them!)  We have only one letterbox in town at <br/>
this point<br/>
&gt; and I'm saving the find for a truly needed moment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was writing IRT storage containers.  Geocaching and LB <br/>
definitely have<br/>
&gt; the camouflage hide/waterproof container needs in common.  <br/>
One of the best<br/>
&gt; _plastic_ non-armed forces related containers I've seen is <br/>
called a Lock &amp;<br/>
&gt; Lock.  They come in a whole slew of sizes but they have a <br/>
rubber gasket in<br/>
&gt; the lid and then four tabs on the top that flip down where they <br/>
then 'lock'<br/>
&gt; over a part of the body on the container.  There is no way water <br/>
will get<br/>
&gt; into these boxes in the field unless it's put in there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, they are hard to find, at least out here in the <br/>
PNW, but<br/>
&gt; I've most recently been excited to see them at Target.  They <br/>
don't have a<br/>
&gt; great selection of sizes, so the choice is VERY limited.  They <br/>
are in their<br/>
&gt; plastic food storage section near the tupperware/sterilite/<br/>
rubbermaid goo.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can also try this link:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://www.lockandlockusa.com<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It will take you to some place called Heritage Mint, but give you <br/>
their<br/>
&gt; Lock &amp; Lock sets, where they have a MUCH better size <br/>
selection.<br/>

&gt; &gt;My first plants are carved and almost ready to go--I am just <br/>
waffling on two<br/>
&gt; &gt;things<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;First, the type of box.  These are regular sized stmaps  (2 to 3 <br/>
inch.) so I<br/>
&gt; &gt;will be using a "regular" sized box.  Any suggestions on what <br/>
to use/not<br/>
&gt; &gt;use?  I noticed that some of the Hefty/Gladware type boxes <br/>
with the lighter<br/>
&gt; &gt;lids did not fare well over time aorund here, so am nixing <br/>
those now...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Second, Log books.  Any input would be appreciated.  Don't <br/>
know why I am<br/>
&gt; &gt;stuck on this, I have seen nearly two hundred different  log<br/>
&gt; &gt;books....Perhaps some of it is placer anxiety.<br/>
