                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Apple Dumpling Gang is pleased to announce that Sarah, our artist <br/>
in residence, will be offering a book making class at the East Coast <br/>
gathering.  I doubt that we will make it by 8:00 AM so plan on an <br/>
afternoon lesson.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in participating, please e-mail us at <br/>
ADGLBNA@aol.com and indicate if you would prefer to bring supplies or <br/>
chip in a little to defer the costs.  ($3.00 should cover it)<br/>
<br/>
Bring any papers that you would like to use for your cover including <br/>
handmade papers, wrapping paper scraps, color copies, photographs, <br/>
ticket stubs, or anything else meaningful to you.  Sarah likes to <br/>
bind her books with ribbon so bring some if you like this method.  <br/>
She generally uses unwired ribbon about an inch or thinner.<br/>
<br/>
To letterboxing dreams and hitchhiker wishes!<br/>

&gt; &gt; that we are a little bit crazy?)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Crazy is a good thing!  Karin (psychomommy) just emailed me and <br/>
said that you <br/>
&gt; are going to teach her how to make your way cool log books at the <br/>
meet and <br/>
&gt; greet - can I join that class too???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Looking forward to meeting you!<br/>
