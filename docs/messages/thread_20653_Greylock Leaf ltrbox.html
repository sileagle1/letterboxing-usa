Has anyone done the greylock leaf letterbox?  (Adams, MAssachusetts) <br/>
I was wondering approx. how long it took from the summit.  I will be <br/>
hiking up Mt. Greylock on Mon. Oct. 11 for the annual Columbus Day <br/>
Ramble and would like to do both letterboxes, but after climbing up <br/>
the mountain my children (and even my folks) may not want do <br/>
more...and this letterbox "trail" is on the opposite side of the <br/>
summit.  If i know the approx time it will take, I can decide <br/>
whether to do it myself (if it's too long or they are too tired) Or <br/>
if we should only do the overlook box.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I'm babbling.<br/>
<br/>
Thx for any input.<br/>

I MIGHT possibly be doing the 2 Greylock boxes on Sunday morning, if <br/>
I do, I'll email you and let you know how long the trip is. :)<br/>

I did the Greylock Leaf about a month back. I think it was about 45<br/>
minutes or so from the summit, but my hiking buddy and I also chose to<br/>
hike after a couple days of heavy rain and the trail was waterlogged<br/>
and the going was rather slow to keep our footing. You can drive up to<br/>
the summit, we came up over the summit on the AT trail as we have been<br/>
trying to do sections of the AT. <br/>
Cheers and happy letterboxing!<br/>
