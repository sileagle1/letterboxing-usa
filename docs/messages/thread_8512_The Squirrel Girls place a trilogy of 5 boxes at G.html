A few days I ago I was worried about the ADG because at least 48 <br/>
hours had gone by without them planting a box.  I'm relieved that <br/>
they have more than made up for days of silence and hope that <br/>
yesterday's distressing day doesn't slow them down.  We all know that <br/>

Our numbers are getting a little off, we are at P31, F41 with 14 <br/>
boxes ready to plant, so more fun to come!  I am off to play in <br/>
Virginia today (gotta keep hunters in two states happy) so look for <br/>
more crazyness this week.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you liked our "trilogy" of 5.  While incorect, it surely gives <br/>
unsuspecting boxers a clue to the state of mind of the ADG!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail!<br/>
