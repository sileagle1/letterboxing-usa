Finally getting around to announcing that our group X-C ski trip <br/>
last Saturday also marked the grand opening of the RI hitcher <br/>
hostel, the "Inn of the End" - to go along with its sister hostel in <br/>
CT, Jay's "Inn of the Beginning". We figured since so many of our <br/>
boxes have hosted hitchers that we have brought in from various <br/>
places (and even a couple that other folks have left!), why not <br/>
have a place here in RI where people could make an official <br/>
hitcher exchange, too, and keep an active hitcher tradition alive <br/>
here in this area when we're gone! So, here it is, now planted in <br/>
the Burlingame area with clues at  <br/>
<br/>
 http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html#Box_50<br/>
<br/>
It may be a bit difficult to locate under the present snowy <br/>
conditions, but we're hoping the hostel will have lots of visitors <br/>
soon!<br/>
<br/>
We've also added another box to the "Ornament" series - a <br/>
Valentine microbox called the "Broken Heart".  Springchick's <br/>
lovely "Kindergarten Keepsakes" sent to us from Michigan is <br/>
also now planted, and there's still plenty of room on the return <br/>
loop for more ornaments!  So, please come and visit when you <br/>
can, and thanks again to all who help make possible great <br/>
letterboxing memories!!!<br/>
<br/>

or W!)<br/>

P.S. Glad that Pete's windbreaker and the Hot Ferrari Pizza at <br/>
URI afterwards helped Andy avoid hypothermia on his first time <br/>
ever out skiing and letterboxing, but Pete's poor hand is still all <br/>
swollen and purple after being the only person dedicated <br/>
enough to go out to look for and find the "Adventures of Tin Tin" - <br/>
as both he and darkness fell that evening!   Almost like how I got <br/>
my hand and leg all banged up and bruised last summer falling <br/>
in a stream enroute to Maine's "100 Mile Wilderness" letterbox <br/>
the hard way - by backpacking the whole 100 miles!  So, I guess <br/>
that qualifies us both for "purple hand" awards for being <br/>
"wounded in the line of letterboxing"!    :-)<br/>
