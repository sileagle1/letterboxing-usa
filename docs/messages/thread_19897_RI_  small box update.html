with the goal of getting ten boxes and not gettting wet.  We <br/>
accomplished both!  Here's a list of the boxes that we found.  All <br/>
are doing well...<br/>
~Gingerbread Man, Gold Star, Christmas Tree, Candy Cane, Silver Bow, <br/>
and Angel Grace of Wanda and Pete's "Favorite Christmas Ornament <br/>
Series"<br/>
~Camping at Burlingame<br/>
~Alice of the "Alice in Wonderland" series<br/>
~Uprising (quite possibly the most incredible box and stamp I've <br/>
seen)<br/>
<br/>
We also found two mystery boxes, also doing well:<br/>
~Quintessential Quonochontaug <br/>
~Burdick Cemetery<br/>
<br/>
"Shine On" HH was resting well with Alice and will be moving on by <br/>
Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.<br/>
<br/>
I think that covers it....it was a busy afternoon!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>
