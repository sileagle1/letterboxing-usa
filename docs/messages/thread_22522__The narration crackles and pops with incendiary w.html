<br/>
OK, here's a topic for ya.  This may or may not have come up in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Do you guys have favorite clues, just because they're written in a very <br/>
witty, clever way?  Which ones?<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that I really loved reading the clues to The Quest in <br/>
Mansfield, CT.  They really made me smile, going into the nuts and bolts of fairy tale <br/>
writing.  Nicely done, Hodsthorn.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I also got a real kick out of this part of the clues to Spring has Sprung in <br/>
Simsbury CT (which I think is missing):<br/>
"With regards to the location, my ex-girlfriend originally showed me this <br/>
tree and told me that it was the oldest tree in CT. I’m not so sure about her <br/>
credentials, but it wouldn’t surprise me if it was true....  You should be able <br/>
to figure out this pseudomystery letterbox if you can figure out where to find <br/>
the tree. (Honestly, I just don’t even know the names of the streets <br/>
specifically. But if you really just don’t know and still want to do this letterbox, <br/>
let me know and we’ll work something out.)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so my current girlfriend and I (I know, I’m such a stud. “Riiiight” <br/>
(said with a Dr. Evil voice)) were letterboxing at Talcott Mountain (oooh another <br/>
clue for the location) and we were hot and tired and just wanted to go home, I <br/>
convinced her to take a quick detour to show her my favorite 23 foot <br/>
circumferenced sycamore tree. Then I planted a letter box there. "<br/>
<br/>
And the clues to Boxing After Dark in Washington DC (also missing?) are <br/>
classic and not to be missed.  <br/>
<br/>
OK, OK, one more.  I really like the poem for "To One in Baltimore."  <br/>
<br/>
So which clues made you smile?<br/>
