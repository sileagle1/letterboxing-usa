this himself, so it falls to me to tell you that somewhere in the <br/>
midst of planting boxes in preparation for the SLO Stampede in the <br/>
Meadow event, he also found some of the boxes that AshRaven and I <br/>
were planting, and one of these, (Rollo the Bankvole to be exact!) <br/>
was his 100th box!<br/>
<br/>
I wish to publicly congratulate him, and to extoll his virtues as a <br/>
letterboxer, anxious worrywart host, and, for my money, an all around <br/>
perfect partner to spend time doing anything at all with.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations, Sir Balthazar, the achievement of the 100 box mark <br/>
is merely a numerical reflection of so many wonderful and varied <br/>
adventures, most of them shared with me, that you have chosen to <br/>
embark on in search of letterboxes in the past eight months.  Let us <br/>
have many, many more such fine times.<br/>
