<br/>
I'm happy to report that the Shieling Forest letterbox (Peterborough, NH) is<br/>
well worth the easy hike in.  I spent about an hour and a half in the park,<br/>
partly because (a) I forgot my compass, and (b) I couldn't identify a<br/>
hemlock if it was right in front of me! *blush and grin*<br/>
<br/>
However, even with several false starts--I believe I went down every trail<br/>
other than the right one before trekking back to the parking lot to pick up<br/>
a map--I was delighted to hike around and enjoy this fabulous setting.  I'll<br/>
go back again.  That's one of the things I'm really enjoying about<br/>
letterboxing: The opportunity to discover glorious new places to hike!<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>

I'm glad it's still there, Aisling!  Please look for my other box
there (Cinco d'Emma Maija - goofy, yeah, I know, but at least I spelled
Shieling Forest correctly that time, not like the stamp for Box #1!) the
next time you go.  The clues are a little tough, a little cryptic,
but the box is worth finding (I hope).  My Noone Falls box in the
same town is very easy to find and a very short walk.  Next time you're
in the area, drop me a line beforehand and maybe we can do an exchange!

Re Shieling Forest #1<br/>
<br/>
We found the "braver" trail....(with our four year old grandson)....but<br/>
were stumped by the two that were once whole since there seemed to be so<br/>
many of them.....Could you help us by giving us an approximate distance<br/>
after your cross the creek on the little bridge??  We'd appreciate it. We<br/>
had a wonderful time on our hike but the little guy is a bit disappointed<br/>
in his Poppa for not finding the trapdoor.....I really tried and he was<br/>
right along side me helping me....We'd love to go there again on Tuesday....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's not my letterbox, but without giving more 
away, these clues are cryptic and it took me a l-o-n-g time to figure them out 
when I found the box (after an hour and a half of hiking in a gorgeous 
area).  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The map in the free booklet at the park entrance 
helped me a lot once I compared the clues with what's featured on that 
map.   (If you don't have that map, you'll find the letterbox if you 
are amaaaaaazingly persistent and/or astute, but I wouldn't have!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Using the map is a very big hint, 
btw.  But, even with more specific directions, this is a tricky box to 
locate.  I nearly gave up.  Email me offlist if you need 
more specific info.  <a href="mailto:lists@aisling.net">lists@aisling.net</a> </div>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By the way, I want to say that the Shieling Forest 
letterbox has such a gorgeous rubber stamp in it, I consider it well worth 
finding!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And, this park is magnificent and peaceful, in 
an almost timeless sense.  Even if you find the letterbox quickly, allow a 
couple of hours and bring a camera, because this is a truly lovely location 
worth exploring.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cheerfully,</div>
<div>Ais, who's going back there again, 
soon!</div></body></html>
