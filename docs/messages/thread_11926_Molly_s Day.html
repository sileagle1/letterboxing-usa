Molly's get together.  It was great getting to meet all these nice <br/>
people.  Red Bird, the kids wanted me to tell you thank you for <br/>
letting them play with Miss Mollie.  They had a great time with her.  <br/>
We wished we could have stayed and finish boxing with everyone but, <br/>
with softball practice, I would not have made it in time if we did.  <br/>
We hope to meet you all again.  Thank you all that put the time and <br/>
effort in for this event.  And thank you all for the exchanges.  God <br/>
Bless Teach &amp; Preach, Little Piggy, and Nappy Kitty.<br/>
