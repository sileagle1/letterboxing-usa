broken bones continues to go well, thanks to all who sent notes!<br/>
<br/>
I've finished carving the "Beating a Dead Horse" stamp and am going <br/>
to turn it into a Postal Letterbox before setting it loose as a <br/>
Hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
We move back aboard our sailboat the first week of April so in order <br/>
to have the Postal circuit completed before then I'll take the first <br/>
12 (or so) members who sign up.<br/>
<br/>
Mailing will be by Priority Mail at a cost of $3.85 plus $1.30 for <br/>
insurance. I will cover the cost of insurance for each participant, <br/>
you are only responsible to use and pay for the Priority Mailing.<br/>
<br/>
To sign up email me here: bindlestiff_boxer at comcast dot net <br/>
(don't forget the underscore mark) <br/>
<br/>
Sign up for this "Beating a Dead Horse" Postal Letterbox ends as <br/>
soon as I have 12 participants or Jan 6th ... which ever comes first.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
