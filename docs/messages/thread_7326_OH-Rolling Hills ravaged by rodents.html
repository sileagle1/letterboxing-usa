rodents.  After MUCH searching it was located with the lid missing , <br/>
stamp slightly chewed and logbook wet and eaten :(  Seeker, we <br/>
recovered the bottom of the box, the log(no stamps in it), and the <br/>
stamp....let us know what you would like us to do with them.  <br/>
The hike was fun....also did Woodchuck Trail....and boy did we see <br/>
woodchucks!! Also saw hundreds of butterflys and a little snake!!  I <br/>
think we all made it home free of ticks as well! :)<br/>
