                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yep, Georgia has a new letterbox. It is a great location and is very <br/>
easy to nab but worth the trip! As far as the secret of the hidden <br/>
agenda, only 3 people *might* know what I was there for. That would be <br/>
Ryan, Amanda from Seattle, and Psychomommy. No, I'm not getting married <br/>
(see clues)--I'm still single and available! ,0) (Georgia single female <br/>
lboxers take note!)<br/>
<br/>
The clues are posted on the letterboxing site. BTW, this box is easy to <br/>
get and takes no time at all, so if you're heading through ATL, in <br/>
either direction, you might want to stop by (but not as easy as a rest <br/>
stop though). <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
