                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well what a fine day.  The calm before the storm for us.  50+ mph <br/>
winds expected by noon Friday.  Watch out for falling trees!<br/>
<br/>
I visited the two boxes from Amanda's "Flight Path" series that I was <br/>
unable to get before.  I was somewhat daring in that I knew where the <br/>
second of the missed boxes was and the first missed box had a clue <br/>
misprint.  Soooo  I went without my clue sheet.  Amazing what my <br/>
brain can dredge up when it REALLY matters.  I was able to find the <br/>
Tokyo flight and found that Traveling Man had shipped out.  I was <br/>
disappointed until I remembered (some time later) that Amanda had <br/>
given him a ride to a fun city to the South.  Alaska is safe and dry.<br/>
<br/>
I am thrilled to report, Amanda, that the Kubota Gardens box is still <br/>
alive and well.  I gave it a dry out.  There is a wonderful message <br/>
written in Japanese in the box.  You will have to have one of your co <br/>
workers translate it for you.  I grew up 2 blocks from the garden and <br/>
had once been inside when it was still the private estate.  What a <br/>
gem of a place.  The family history is fabulous.  I hope Seattle does <br/>
everything possible to preserve this special park.  Today they were <br/>
tearing down the old family home ( :-(  )  I hope there are plans to <br/>
replace with a fine traditional structure.<br/>
<br/>
To the Nail Family I look forward to your new plants.  I have <br/>
successfully "got" all of Trial and Errors boxes at the Pt Defiance <br/>
venue.  Sometimes however I work the language of his clues too hard. <br/>
<br/>
Gotta relax and not think so much.  But that T &amp; E he is a sneaky one <br/>
you know.<br/>
<br/>
I hope the weekend weather will be OK.  It will feel good to get out <br/>
on the prowl again and hike off the Holiday excess.  I fear my <br/>
trainer will show no mercy tomorrow a.m. as I praised her lesson last <br/>
Monday so highly ( 45 minutes without stirrups is really my idea of <br/>
fun)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers to all.  Stay warm Nor-easters<br/>
