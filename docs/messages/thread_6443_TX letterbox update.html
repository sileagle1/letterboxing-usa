There have been some postings on TX letterboxes so I thought I'd give <br/>
an update. Also, please see my earlier posting #12599 for an update <br/>
on the Brownsville boxes or type "TX letterbox" in the search engine.<br/>
<br/>
Lost Pines Letterbox, Buescher State Park, Smithville TX: very kid <br/>
friendly because there is a shortcut provided in the clues; box is in <br/>
great condition; beautiful hand-carved stamp.<br/>
<br/>
O-Knots Letterbox Series, Bastrop State Park, Bastrop, TX: a little <br/>
more challenging because you use an orienteering map; a lot of fun <br/>
and a lot of poison ivy; kid friendly; not hand-carved, but beautiful <br/>
celtic knots; found knots 1, 2 &amp; 4; kids too tired for #3; all boxes <br/>
in great shape; knot #1 was out in the open probably from heavy <br/>
rains; we replanted it where it was supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
Shavian Cowboy Letterbox: very kid friendly, but an adult needs to <br/>
decipher the clues which are written in code; box in great shape; <br/>
great hand-carved stamp; the clues are not currently found on the <br/>
letterboxing.org website but if you go the clues for the above boxes, <br/>
the owner has a link to his own website which has more TX boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Mt. Bonnell Letterbox, Austin: our P2 and we thank Charles (and <br/>
family) for appreciating our hard work and giving us our first <br/>
compliments. We dried it out twice already due to the heavy rains and <br/>
doubled the plastic bags.<br/>
<br/>
Barton Springs Greenbelt Letterbox, Austin: our P3 and anxious for <br/>
visitors; very kid friendly except for some thorny vines.<br/>
<br/>
Wraith of the Woods Letterbox,Austin: we did not visit because you <br/>
need a GPS<br/>
<br/>
Gordian Knot Letterbox, Austin: we did not visit because you need a <br/>
GPS.<br/>
<br/>
Enchanted Rock Letterbox, Fredericksburg, TX: we did not visit yet.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this posting helps esp Rosana, Charles, Gwen &amp; Don!<br/>

letterboxes. All listed are in good shape - alive and well! Thanks for <br/>
the fun hikes.<br/>

McFalls<br/>
USA Flag<br/>
Bevo<br/>
Texas Sized<br/>
Barton Creek Greenbelt<br/>
Mt. Bonnell<br/>
<br/>
However, Eoghan indeed reports that Wraith of the Woods is regrettably <br/>
MIA.<br/>
<br/>
The Brown Knight also planted two new letterboxes, one hard and one <br/>
easy: Gunslinger and 360 Bridge.<br/>
