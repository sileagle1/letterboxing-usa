<br/>
John and I went out this afternoon for a nice day of letterboxing.  We<br/>
managed to find Funhog's lovely Discovery Trail Letterbox.  Lovely<br/>
little stamp and it has been visited quite a bit.  The container and one<br/>
of the ziplocs was a bit damp, but the logbook was safe and dry.  We<br/>
dried the baggie and the container out with a paper towel and returned<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Rookery...all I've got to show for that one is scratches from<br/>
stickery weeds.  We tried every which way we could imagine.  I'm pretty<br/>
useless as far as a compass goes, so we tried all the obvious suspects<br/>
and still came up empty-handed.  I had heard this letterbox was missing,<br/>
but you never know.  Funhog's clues are always clever and sometimes you<br/>
have to be persistent, but we usually gain the box if it's there.  This<br/>
time, however, we were quite unsuccessful.  Still, we did see the lovely<br/>
rookery referred to in the clues so all was not lost.  The only things<br/>
we found that were plastic was an empty coke bottle and an empty shotgun<br/>
shell.  Not the desirable plastic we were looking for!<br/>
<br/>
It was a good day to go out on Discovery Trail, though, and we had a<br/>
good time.  Thanks for placing Funhog!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
