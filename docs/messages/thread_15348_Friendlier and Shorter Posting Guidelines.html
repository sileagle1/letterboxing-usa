Posting Guidelines [DRAFT 082603]<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the LBNA email discussion list.  Here are a few <br/>
friendly guidelines for posting to the list.  <br/>
<br/>
--Before posting a question, please read the LBNA FAQ. It <br/>
answers many common questions. Also, read the list for a while <br/>
and familiarize yourself with the posters and the topics that are <br/>
discussed.<br/>
<br/>
--Because the list has such a large number of posts, please do <br/>
not post excessively.  Try to keep your posts short and to the <br/>
point.  <br/>
<br/>
--Make the subject line of your post as specific as possible and <br/>
include the state, if applicable.  Some examples: MA: New <br/>
Waltham Boxes; NY: Poughkeepsie Gathering Oct. 19-20<br/>
<br/>
--When replying to posts, don't quote the entire post but just the <br/>
lines you are referring to.  Also, it's best to reply only if you have <br/>
something new to add.  Avoid replying only with "ditto" or "me <br/>
too."<br/>
<br/>
--Keep the subject of a thread up-to-date. If you change the <br/>
content of the thread, please change the subject line accordingly.  <br/>
This makes it easier for people to decide if they want to read your <br/>
message.<br/>
<br/>
--Don't add attachments.  They spread viruses like wildfire.<br/>
<br/>
--And last but not least: Thanks for joining from LBNA email <br/>
discussion list.  We look forward to getting to know you!<br/>

Oooh, I like this one.  Says the same basic things, but without <br/>
*sounding* insulting...even though I feel that the first set was done <br/>
more "tongue-n-cheek" than it was meant to be really insulting.<br/>
<br/>
This set of guidelines I feel will be less likely to be taken as <br/>
offensive.<br/>

&gt; Posting Guidelines [DRAFT 082603]<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Welcome to the LBNA email discussion list. <add <br="" brief="" description="">
of mission as shown at LbNA talklist page&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here are a few friendly guidelines for posting to the list. <br/>
<br/>
These guidelines are intended to make this list newbie-friendly and <br/>
also cut down on the amount of unnecessary posts that clog the list <br/>
and are a hardship on those with slower connections.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; --Before posting a question, please read the LBNA FAQ. It <br/>
&gt; answers many common questions. Also, read the list for a while <br/>
&gt; and familiarize yourself with the posters and the topics that are <br/>
&gt; discussed.  <br/>
<br/>
You are more likely to get a fast, courteous response when you show <br/>
that you have taken the time to read these items and other websites <br/>
related to letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; --Because the list has such a large number of posts, please do <br/>
&gt; not post excessively.  Try to keep your posts short and to the <br/>
&gt; point.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; --Make the subject line of your post as specific as possible and <br/>
&gt; include the state, if applicable.  Some examples: MA: New <br/>
&gt; Waltham Boxes; NY: Poughkeepsie Gathering Oct. 19-20<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; --When replying to posts, don't quote the entire post but just the <br/>
&gt; lines you are referring to.  Also, it's best to reply only if you <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; something new to add.  Avoid replying only with "ditto" or "me <br/>
&gt; too."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; --Keep the subject of a thread up-to-date. If you change the <br/>
&gt; content of the thread, please change the subject line accordingly.  <br/>
&gt; This makes it easier for people to decide if they want to read your <br/>
&gt; message.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; --Don't add attachments.  They spread viruses like wildfire.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; --And last but not least: Thanks for joining from LBNA email <br/>
&gt; discussion list.  We look forward to getting to know you!<br/>
<br/>
--- Listed below are links to other sites related to letterboxing and <br/>
stamp carving.  Please go to them and read them.  They were created <br/>
for you!<br/>
<br/>
<add list=""><br/>
<br/>
---PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS WELCOME LETTER.  QUESTIONS REGARDING <br/>
THE YAHOO TALK GROUP OR LBNA SITE SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE <br/>
WEBMASTERS OR MODERATORS AT:<br/>
<br/>
<list addresses=""><br/>
<br/>
What I suggest is that this be posted weekly to the talk list as <br/>
something like: Subject: ANNOUNCEMENT - WELCOME!  Please read before <br/>
posting to this list.<br/>
<br/>
That way, all of us who want to skip it can filter it out, but it <br/>
should grab any newbie's attention, and they don't have to go <br/>
clicking around the web to find the initial welcome note and <br/>
guidelines.  Can it be something that goes right to every new <br/>
subscriber by default?<br/>
<br/>
Because the guidelines are created for all of us for the better use <br/>
and enjoyment of everyone, newbies alike, can we poll the members to <br/>
date to approve the final draft?<br/>

<br/>
  Just an FYI, but there is an existing set of guidelines. This is how <br/>
  it is listed on the letterboxing-usa homepage. <br/>
<br/>
  "List etiquette and conventions are at:<br/>
  http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html "<br/>
<br/>
  For those who read the messages online, there are many useful links <br/>
  listed above the messages on the homepage.<br/>
