I love your enthusiasm for the sport, and the fact that you want to<br/>
share this with your daughter and her friends!<br/>
All my adult life I have worked/ volunteered with children's groups (<br/>
from pre-K thru college) and at one time was director of a<br/>
preschool/kids'-day-out program - I add this only because I hope you'll<br/>
believe that I love kids and have some experience with different age<br/>
groups;-)!<br/>
BUT...I flinched a little thinking about a birthday party of 4-year olds<br/>
going letterboxing as a group! (Although maybe your 4 year olds are much<br/>
gentler and more sedate than 4 year olds I have known and loved!)I would<br/>
worry about taking good care of the logbooks, re-hiding the boxes, being<br/>
subtle in finding the boxes and so on!<br/>
<br/>
Here's a suggestion: How about creating very special letterboxes to hide<br/>
around your own yard or neighborhood or playground? It would be even<br/>
more special if they tie in with something special in your daughter's<br/>
life -(her favorite animal, book, whatever!)<br/>
<br/>
Happy birthday to your daughter!<br/>
