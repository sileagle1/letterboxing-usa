I would figure that the *person* is figuring that if enough boxes in that area go missing, 1. a lot of finders may get frustrated and quit looking for boxes on the assumption that they'll probably be missing; and 2. a lot of planters may give up on planting in that area on the assumption that their boxes will go missing.  Thus in the long run, less trompling. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It may force more letterboxers "underground" the way things first began in the U.S. and thus a lot less damage to the environment due to a lot fewer searchers.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can understand the person's frustration.  We have planters in this neck of the woods who are responsible, in my opinion, and plant only along right along the trails in ways that I would never call destructive or they plant in parking lots, zoos, etc, and we have other planters who have ranted and raved about being told by a park ranger that where they wanted to plant a box was in an ecosystem inhabited by an endangered species and to please plant elsewhere.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I think it also bears mentioning  that for every one letterbox in an area there are probably one hundred geocaches.  Boy, that stuff in the geocaches in his photos sure looked like junk.  Yech.     <br/>

There are lots of geocachers who call poorly-hidden, or poorly thought-out, geocaches, "Geo-trash".  Another popular term of derision is "micro-spew", which is used at the proliferation of lamp-post skirt hides and similar caches.  Trust me; most geocachers are just as appalled at bad form as most letterboxers are.  And I emphasize "most"; every group (and I do mean EVERY GROUP) has a few members who really do not get it.<br/>
<br/>
As someone who caches and boxes, I make a point of trying to learn, and apply, techniques taken from one activity, to the other.  This is what rational people do.  Rejecting an activity out-of-hand as "juvenile" or "pointless" or even "destructive", without knowing more about it, is not rational behavior.  I do admit that I get tired, sometimes, of defending letterboxing to geocachers who don't "get it", and won't try, and the same applies to letterboxers who refuse to try to "get" geocaching.  I don't demand that everyone enjoy both hobbies, but I sure would like to see those who only do one thing stop disparaging the other one.<br/>

I don't really get the appeal of geocaching but there are many people who don't get the whole letterboxing thing.<br/>
I did go though a period of disparaging geocachers but hope I've mended my ways. Most of the cachers I've met on the trail seem to be nice people. As letterboxers we do need to get the word out to cachers about how we play the game. I think most letterboxers know what geocaching is but I don't think the opposite holds true.<br/>
Bad mouthing cachers in the various forums is not going to make them want to understand us and will alienate crossover boxers.<br/>

1. More geocaches mean less finds per geocache. <br/>
2. Disparaging one activity to make yours feel better is petty and childish <br/>
3. The cache maggot makes no good points because they don't take the high road on their position. Many caches were placed with permission. <br/>

If you're saying that I'm disparaging geocaching to make myself feel better because I letterbox and don't geocache , nope, sorry, I truly do believe the stuff in those geocaches was junk junk junk.  If someone wants to do it, that's fine and dandy.  Is there any geocacher who looked at the contents of  those boxes and didn't see junk?  Attempting to find the cache, finding the cache, logging in, being happy that one found the cache, that's one thing.  But what I saw in those boxes in those photos was junk. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just because something is placed with permission doesn't make it right.  We have a county to the west of us -- rhymes with Kane County -- where the forest preserve people are very open about not really caring where boxes are placed.  They take the view that people pay taxes, taxes keep the forest preserves going, and doing things like geocaching and letterboxing draws folks out to the preserves and makes them think positively about their tax dollars going to support the preserves.  So they look the other way on wherever someone wants to plant a box or cache.  There's at least one box that I know of planted where finders have to go slogging thru some very sensitive wetland.  In my book, because there's permission granted, doesn't make it right.  But that's only my opinion. <br/>

Speaking as a 'treasure' hunter, I can totally agree.  I hunt boxes for the personal artwork (that's why I value even a rough hand-carved stamp over a store-bought one any day!).  However, my kids are definitely treasure 'hunters' - for them it's all about the hunt &amp; the find.  We have hunted a couple geocaches - to see what that game is like - and while I was fairly disapointed with it, the kids "ooh"ed and "aah"ed over all the little 'trinkets'.  As Mark said - to each their own!<br/>

Children love trinkets - when they pull out their baggie of plastic disney figures, marbles, and hair scrunchies to trade for the toy car in the cache, are you going to tell your child their prized possessions are a bunch of junk and their trading junk for junk?<br/>
<br/>
So many letterboxers claim they love letterboxing for the adventure, for the walk in the woods, for the new places they visit but you mention geocaching, which possesses all the same goals, and yet they poo-poo the game because there are children's trinkets in the box.<br/>

We do trade out the geocoins and have an account on gc.com for those occasional gc finds to let the planters know all is fine in their plants.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot more creativity in concealment techniques by more polished gc'ers in the parallel hobby.  We have employed some in lbx's that we have stashed.<br/>
