to 'box with your dog, this may be of interest to you.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to let folks know that this Saturday, Oct 4 at the Rocky Woods <br/>
Reservation in Medfield, MA there will be a great event promoting the Trustees <br/>
of Reservations' <br/>
GREEN DOGS; Sharing the Trails program from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
(BTW: Rocky Woods is home to several letterboxes placed by CavyLovers) ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The event is called dogFEST and is promoting responsible dog ownership and <br/>
fostering good relations between the trail users at Rocky Woods. This is a pilot <br/>
program that issues permits to dog walkers and has designated areas where <br/>
dogs must be on-leash and areas where they can be off-leash...and one small area <br/>
where dogs are kept out for those who prefer a quiet, contemplative area. <br/>
<br/>
The event will feature food, fun activities for kids (make your own dog <br/>
ears!, face painting etc) and contests (dog-owner look alike, best smile, best <br/>
trick, doggie limbo, bobbing for hotdogs and more!). <br/>
<br/>
There will also be Q &amp; A areas like "ask the trainer" and "Ask the Vet". <br/>
There will be Agility and Search and Rescue Demos and a Dog officer round table. <br/>
You can sign up for the Canine Good Citizen Certification and can get your dog <br/>
microchipped for safety. <br/>
<br/>
Some other dog interest groups will be on-hand to answer questions.There will <br/>
also be folks on-hand to lead nature walks and to sign people up for the <br/>
Greendogs program.<br/>
<br/>
For this ONE DAY ONLY dogs will be allowed in ordinarily off-limits areas <br/>
(though I must say that normally MOST of the reservation is open to dogs with <br/>
Green dogs permits).<br/>
<br/>
It should be a fun day. I will be working the Ask the Trainer session from 10 <br/>
-11 a.m. before I head down to the Cape Caper.<br/>
<br/>
So come show your support for the Green Dogs program! For more information, <br/>
contact me offlist or go to <a href="www.thetrustees.org">www.thetrustees.org</a> and click on EVENTS.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
