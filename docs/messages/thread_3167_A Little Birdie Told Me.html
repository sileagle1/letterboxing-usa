tell you it's in one of the boxes near Seattle.<br/>
<br/>
Hitchhiker name: A Little Birdie Told Me<br/>
Location: Seattle area<br/>
Date placed: August 24, 2001<br/>
<br/>
I'll keep the history of the hitchhiker (or at least as much as I <br/>
know about its travels) at <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Letterboxing/birdieToldMe.html<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

PS. Thanks to everyone who hid letterboxes in the Seattle area.  I've <br/>
had a busy weekend and increased my F-count by 19.  And discovered <br/>
lots of interesting new places I never even knew existed while I was <br/>
at it.  Thanks!  =)<br/>
