                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finally got around to making a new log book. I have the box here with <br/>
me at work and will be replacing it Monday AM when I get out of work <br/>
(6am).  We made this new book a little bigger -- those of you who <br/>
could not fit your personal stamp on the page now have some chance to <br/>
get most of it!  <br/>
<br/>
For those not overly familiar with this area, it is very close to <br/>
both the new walmart supercenter and the Waterford Commons shops -- <br/>
so come stamp in if you find yourself doing some christmas/other-<br/>
holiday-festival shopping! <br/>
<br/>
Ok, enough cheap plugs for our letterboxes, back to the Sunday night <br/>
football game. I mean...uhh.... back to work....! <br/>

<br/>
ps - if you're reading this closely, look for more cemetary boxes as <br/>
the spring thaw begins in 2004. <hint hint=""> <br/>
