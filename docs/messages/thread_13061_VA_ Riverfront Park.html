<br/>
It's amazing how a semi-urban trail can still make you feel like your out in <br/>
nature.  The birds were really singing.  And, except for right by the <br/>
underpass, they were the only noise you heard.<br/>
<br/>
We really enjoyed this series.  The clues were very clear and the hiding <br/>
places specific.  Plus, all those great benches!!  What a luxury to sit and <br/>
stamp in!  The bunny, his basket, egg and peeps were all in great shape.<br/>
<br/>
Noting the caution against mud and stream crossings in the second half of <br/>
the series, we decided to call it a day after the first four.  We walked <br/>
back to the lot along main street, admiring all the funky stuff in the <br/>
various store windows.<br/>
<br/>
QUESTION:  Where does the dam trail start?  Does one continue down the <br/>
gravel path or do we need to go down the other paved path back at the <br/>
parking lot?  We weren't sure.  We would love to come back and look for <br/>
those boxes once the land has had a chance to dry up.  Thanks!  BeMa<br/>

I'm not sure, but I think you are referring to Riverfront Park in MD, not VA?<br/>
<br/>
If so, the dam trail does start up at the parking lot.  I highly recommend <br/>
going back for the second series - the stamps are wonderful!<br/>

Thanks Coleen!  You're right!  Big DUH on this end!  We get so used to being <br/>
in VA.  I'm glad we are brave enough to cross a bridge or to and go to <br/>
 &gt;gasp&lt; another state.  You know how some folks can be reluctant to cross <br/>
over the lines around here!<br/>
<br/>
So, the dam trail is that other paved trail at the back of the original <br/>
parking lot?  That is great to know!  We look forward to completing the <br/>
other half of the series if the weather ever cooperates!<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, thanks again!  We'll keep working on our geography...(I <br/>
guess you know understand how we get lost all the time...)  Bema<br/>

I'm so glad you liked the Easter Bunny series. After finding out <br/>
that the poison ivy came out after the boxes were planted, I went <br/>
back with my clippers and did some pruning. <br/>
<br/>
The dam trail follows the river up stream and can get very muddy. It <br/>
starts at the parking lot but goes the opposite way of the easter <br/>
bunny. With all of this rain, I bet they are releasing water from <br/>
the top of the dam, so I'm off to check out the waterfall.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Firefly for helping them out.<br/>

Did you get your stamp back? The lure of the falling water must have <br/>
distracted you. Glad you like those stamps. I know, they are kinda <br/>
large, but they were my first. I even put a little red stamp pad in <br/>
with the woodpecker box so he could have red feathers on his top not.<br/>
