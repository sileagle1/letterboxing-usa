OK, here's the story first, then the clues.   If you're not interested, then <br/>
it's OK to skip this.  After 21 soccer teams spread over 3 kids and umpteen <br/>
seasons I've had enough to last a lifetime.  So I decided to plant boxes at <br/>
or near the fields where my son is playing this fall.  And, since he is a <br/>
lowly 7th grader on a large team of mostly 8th graders, he won't get much <br/>
playing time and I won't miss him while he's just sitting on the bench.  Why <br/>
let an opportunity like this pass me by!  On to the clues:<br/>
