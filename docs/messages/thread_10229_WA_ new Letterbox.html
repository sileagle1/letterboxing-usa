broken eggs, Humpty Dumpty seems a little better these days.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody really did on number on him, smashing him into 3 bits and <br/>
strewing them all about the park.  Boy, were we happy to find the <br/>
bits and put them all together earlier today!  Wow--he looks so much <br/>
better now!  You know, whoever pushed Humpty must've pushed a large <br/>
tree over, too, as we had to climb over this REALLY big tree along <br/>
the trail--the kids LOVED it!  Hopefully, somebody can stop that <br/>
rascally culprit before he goes on to break anything else in that <br/>
park!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for another great series!!!<br/>
