Dublin, Ohio   Franklin County<br/>
Difficulty: 1<br/>
<br/>
The 3rd box placed in the series: Art in Public<br/>
places.  To find the area where to look for these<br/>
letterboxes all you have to do is go to<br/>
www.sculpturecenter.org/oosi/oo.asp. Once here you go<br/>
to searching oosi, you can either enter the artist<br/>
name or the name of the letterbox title under advance<br/>
query. This will take you to the site about this<br/>
sculpture and where it is located. Once you find out<br/>
where to head then read the clues to find the<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Columbus artist Todd Slaughter created Watch House in<br/>
1998. Watch House consists of a copper house situated<br/>
on top of a circular Native American-inspired earthen<br/>
mound. The center of the mound is sunken and is home<br/>
to prairie grass and sunflowers, which refer to the<br/>
garden crops of the Hopewell Indians who were Ohio's<br/>
first farmers. The copper house consists of a<br/>
planetarium-like domed ceiling with cutouts of<br/>
household items. These shaped light portals have a<br/>
double metaphor, the expanding universe and the<br/>
changing nature of the family in our contemporary<br/>
society. Watch House stands as a symbol of the<br/>
connection between Dublin's native cultures and<br/>
contemporary cultures.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues to the Letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Park in the recreation center parking lot. And walk<br/>
over the bridge to the Watch House. It is quite a<br/>
unique sculpture. Stand in the door way without the<br/>
hand. Take one pace (1 pace = 2 steps) at 245 degrees.<br/>
Then head 16 paces at 287 degrees. This will bring you<br/>
to the edge of the shrub line. The box is hidden under<br/>
a stack of rocks.  The park this sits in also has a<br/>
roller-blade/skateboard park.<br/>
Enjoy the area.<br/>
