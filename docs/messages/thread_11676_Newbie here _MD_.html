                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all!I just got started letterboxing! I've always loved hiking and this kinda gives it a new depth! I've found 6 boxes in Maryland and can't wait to have time to travel further out to find more! I've got the Brookside Gardens one (I've always loved that place) two in the attached Wheaton Reg. Park, one at Northwest Branch Park, the new 'Roscoe Gives a Tour' in Takoma Park and the Lake Frank Turtle. I looked for the Lake Frank Dragonfly, does anyone know if this is missing? I might have been in the wrong place. I hope to plant my first box at Lake Frank this weekend!I'm also interested in meeting everyone at the VA gathering, so I'm watching that develop with interest. Let me know if I can help.I carved my first stamp last night and everyone was right, it is easier then I thought it would be and a lot of fun! (I think a monster has been created) I'll be planting more soon. Thanks for this new and wonderful hobby! (way of life maybe?) Debbie (Debean, DK)<br/>
