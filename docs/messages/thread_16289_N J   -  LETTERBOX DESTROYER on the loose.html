Hummingbird letterbox stolen as of 10/8/2003<br/>
Hummingbird letterbox planted 9/5/2003<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How frustrating!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I was checking on one of my boxes this evening, and it has been<br/>
stolen. It wasn't out there long.  During the time it was hiding we<br/>
checked on the box 2 seperate times and all was well.  It will not be<br/>
replaced so consider your image a historical momento.  Appears someone<br/>
in a car slide down the hill by the tracks and got stuck.  Maybe they<br/>
are the culprits.  Lots of new broken beer bottles there tooo.  <br/>
<br/>
This sux, so now there is a "letterbox destroyer" loose in Southern<br/>
New Jersey, beware!!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
This is THE BEST example of the "WRONG TYPE OF CROWD TO BE INFORMED OF<br/>
LETTERBOXING"<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>

<br/>
Trust me the box was STOLEN!!!!<br/>
<br/>
The location of this box was tucked (literally snugly fitting) <br/>
underneath some train tracks.  It was THE perfect spot: <br/>
<br/>
     *First of all, the "hiding spot" was not a WELL traveled area of <br/>
the woods, the road it's off of is, but the hiding spot was down a <br/>
hill that someone wouldn't normally be walking around there or <br/>
snooping around at<br/>
<br/>
     *someone had to reach with human hands to even grasp the box and <br/>
then pull the box out<br/>
<br/>
     *the tracks completely covered the box making it waterproof and <br/>
completely hidden<br/>
<br/>
     *the findings of the cars tracks down the hill (they must have <br/>
had to wait for help to pull them out and had time to snoop in the <br/>
area and came upon my box, hence the additional pile of broken beer <br/>
bottles scattered on the ground at the "hiding spot"<br/>
<br/>
      *we are VERY familiar with that area and have never ever seen <br/>
anyone ever slide, drive, or fall down that hill ever before in the <br/>
23 years we've traveled and walked that area.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
JUST VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>
