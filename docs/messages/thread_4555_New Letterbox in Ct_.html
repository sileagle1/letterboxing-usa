                          TYLER MILL OPEN SPACE<br/>
Where : Wallingford Ct.<br/>
Number of boxes : 2<br/>
Placed by Butterfly on Feb 20, 2002<br/>
Hike Distance : under 2 miles.<br/>
Wear Orange during hunting season<br/>
Difficulty : Easy with one short steep climb.<br/>
*Directions: from I91-traveling to the north , exit 14 onto Woodhouse<br/>
Ave. [rt.150]. Turn right and travel for 1.3 miles down a sharp curving<br/>
road and at the bottom of the hill , just over a stream with guard<br/>
rails, turn right into a large parking lot.<br/>
*Directions : from I91 traveling to the south, exit 14  Center Street.<br/>
Turn right and travel to the traffic light  at the intersection of rt<br/>
150 [Woodhouse Ave] turn left and after a traffic light and the overpass<br/>
over I91, continue  on rt.150 for 1.3 miles down a sharp curving road<br/>
and at the bottom of the hill, just over a stream with a guard rail ,<br/>
turn right into a large parking lot.<br/>
*The Hike : Carefully walk across the road [40 degrees] and climb over<br/>
the guard rail on an unmarked path to cross a small stream seasonally<br/>
wet. Arrive at the blue trail. Turn right [120 degrees] to begin a<br/>
counter clockwise loop. Travel on the blue trail passing many small side<br/>
trails. The red markers on the trees are part of the Tyler Mill Nature<br/>
trail which we will see from time to time. Stay on the blue trail as it<br/>
travels up a hill and twist and turns through the forest, passing by<br/>
bike trails and into a hemlock grove and bearing right  down to a 'T'<br/>
and a well defined woods road. The blue trail turns right and we turn<br/>
left [north] on the woods road with old stone walls on both sides . This<br/>
was a well traveled wagon road many years ago.<br/>
Soon you arrive at an old homestead with the tumbled down foundations of<br/>
the home, barn and outbuildings. Notice the two old huge twin sugar<br/>
maple trees just ahead . One on each side of the trail. Stand between<br/>
them, in the middle of the trail and at a heading of 320 degrees, take<br/>
about 15 steps up the bank to a maple tree growing in the stone wall. At<br/>
it's base is the Twin Maple Tree Letterbox. Stamp in and carefully<br/>
re-hide the box . This is a busy spot.!<br/>
Back on the trail continue northerly and very soon pass another bike<br/>
trail and then in about 50 feet, turn left through a stone wall onto a<br/>
well used unmarked trail. Pass into a lovely hemlock grove with the<br/>
river down on your right  the trail begins a gentle climb. You continue<br/>
to see the red Nature Trail markers high in the trees. Notice a large<br/>
fallen tree on your left as you travel along and a stone wall on your<br/>
right. Passing through the stone wall on the trail, you soon come to a<br/>
busy 4 way intersection. Take the trail at 240 degrees  and begin a<br/>
short steep climb. At Marker # 19 the trail narrows and is steep coming<br/>
to a 'Y' bear to the right. Look up the hill and notice a large three<br/>
sister tree. Climb up to it and stand on the west side of the tree<br/>
facing west. Look ahead at 220 degrees to a group of Cedar trees and a<br/>
two sister oak. The Morris Rock Letterbox is hidden here by the middle<br/>
Cedar tree. Stamp in and please re-hide carefully as this is also a busy<br/>
place. Return to the trail and head west to enjoy Morris Rock Vista . At<br/>
180 degrees is the'doorway' down between two trees on an unmarked trail<br/>
The trail is trap rock and can be tricky as it twists and turns. Once<br/>
down you meet up again with the blue trail where you began the loop,<br/>
recross the brook and road to your car. I hope you enjoyed the short<br/>
hike at Tyler Mill.<br/>
