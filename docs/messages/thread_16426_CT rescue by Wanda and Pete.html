                    <div class="plaintext-content">I totally enjoyed this story of Uncle Sam's Nephew l.b. being <br/>
snatched from the hollow of a tree before discovery by hoards of leaf <br/>
peeping weekend walkers.  How the heck did Wanda keep a poker face <br/>
while hearing the ensuing "hollows in trees as habitats" lecture??  <br/>
My hat (which shades an often  tell-tale blushing face) is off to her <br/>
valiant efforts in the name of preserving the sanctity of a <br/>
tupperware's generally peaceful and safe sanctuary. <br/>
