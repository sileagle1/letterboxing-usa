Â I like your carvings and think you did a good job at them. You do need to 
get a better picture of yourself so we can see you and you are not in the 
shadows. I was also hoping to see more of your dogs. You made some very nice dog 
stamps and I was glad you did post them so I could see some stamps from other 
parts of the country. I also looked at your clues to see how you did them. Very 
good. You seemed to have some good ideas there. Thanks for giving us a look at 
your website. I enjoyed looking. Wish we could meet you and your dogs.....Chuck 
and Molly in CT</span></div></body></html>
