"Love Valley" letterbox (Iredell County, NC), but my friends and I<br/>
went there yesterday and we turned over every rock in the designated<br/>
"pile of rocks" and could not find it. I'm afraid it may be MIA. Can<br/>
anyone confirm or refute this?<br/>
<br/>
One thing more, the "Old Jail" mentioned in the clues has been torn<br/>
down... there's nothing left where it was except the foundation and<br/>
the barred door to the jail cell. Someone who works in Love Valley<br/>
showed us where the jail used to be and from there, we had no problem<br/>
finding the Twin Poplars and all the rest of the landmarks, but no<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
