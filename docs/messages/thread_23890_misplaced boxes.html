letterboxing. When I started letterboxing after reading <br/>
the Time magazine article a few years ago, there were many <br/>
complaints on the lists about the same issues. Things tend <br/>
to settle down after the latest rush of newbies start <br/>
correcting their early mistakes or move onto another <br/>
hobby. Hopefully, this will happen with the latest new <br/>
boxers that started from reading the recent articles in <br/>
Family Fun and Games. We've tried to add more emphasis to <br/>
rehiding in LbNA Getting Started info and one every clue <br/>
page, but maybe there is more that we can do.<br/>
<br/>
I know that doesn't make it any less painful for you, of <br/>
course.<br/>

<br/>
Hi Wildcats<br/>
<br/>
I could cite several problems we had with letterboxes right after an <br/>
article, but just chose to advise csb-bc as to what the problem <br/>
could be.<br/>
 There are many new letterboxers that never see a chatlist and go <br/>
letterboxing without figuring out that little Johnnie isn't the <br/>
proper person to rehide a box. That is why I chose to write about <br/>
what we do when receiving a "Contact the Placer" note, and list the <br/>
links we send them. <br/>
Now granted most folks that use this function probably would find <br/>
other stuff on their own, but some need a little nudging. <br/>
There are letterboxers that have around for some time that have <br/>
never gone on a chatlist, perused files,links, and other <br/>
informational web sites. <br/>
There are some letterboxers that do not understand where some hidden <br/>
clues are stashed as well.<br/>
 While I was pointing fingers at new letterboxers, I see it as an <br/>
educating problem rather than a "stupid" problem. Many times the <br/>
articles are so brief and poorly written that the nuances are lost, <br/>
and the new letterboxer just fumbles on their own.<br/>
We recently had a writer contact a regional chatlist and I wrote the <br/>
reasons why I chose not to participate in their article. There was <br/>
some back and forth debate between us, but for me the bottom line <br/>
was the newspaper is in the business of selling papers and the <br/>
editors could really care less that the article represents <br/>
letterboxing and all of its ins and outs.<br/>
Generally speaking I do not trust the press. This writer expressed <br/>
that she had done a great deal of research already, but wanted to <br/>
quote a letterboxer that had been around for 10 years. Now had she <br/>
really done research she would have known that letterboxing in the <br/>
US hasn't been around that long.<br/>
<br/>
Lock Wench just posted(on AQ) a copy of an article she was quoted <br/>
in, and that article was probably one of the best written pieces <br/>
I've seen. But will that keep the new boxer from doing stuff they <br/>
shouldn't...maybe...maybe not. It just depends on the individual.<br/>

Hi<br/>
<br/>
I am one of these so called "new letterboxers" that every one is <br/>
complaining about. I have been only involed for less than a month <br/>
BUT I did my home work. I researched the "RULES" that you all <br/>
follow. I explained the rules to my son.I searched out the boxes and <br/>
rehid them well.I dried all contents and replaced well in their <br/>
bags.I am respectful of the time and effort that was put into the <br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
You guys are almost scaring me out of this all though.God forbid I <br/>
ever find one of your boxes that a squirll or a dog found and have <br/>
to take the blame. We are not talking about the Amazon jungle here <br/>
where no man has gone before.Things happen,the wind blows, people <br/>
explore,dogs sniff around.<br/>
<br/>
The very first letter box I ever found was one my dog carried out <br/>
from under a foot bridge.I left a note that it was found on accident <br/>
and rehid it.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone was a "new letterboxer" once. I think we have to remeber <br/>
that.<br/>

&gt; Hi<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I am one of these so called "new letterboxers" that every one is <br/>

<br/>
Hi Wilton<br/>
<br/>
Since you are responding to my post please reread it. I believe that <br/>
my point was NOT new letterboxers that read chatlists and do their <br/>
homework, but more directly at the publications that carry articles <br/>
regarding letterboxing. There are some new letterboxers that do not <br/>
go to the same lengths that you do, and they probably aren't reading <br/>
this in any case. They pick up the info about letterboxing through <br/>
poorly written articles.<br/>
<br/>
I do realize that everyone was a new letterboxer at some time. When <br/>
we started we made several mistakes too, but we didn't have the <br/>
newboxers list, "Getting Started" articles at LbNA, and the vast <br/>
amount of info now available.<br/>
I spend a great deal of time at the newboxers list, and I do so for <br/>
selfish reasons....Education for the new folks, and I even learn a <br/>
thing or two there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; You guys are almost scaring me out of this all though.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This list can be brutally frank, even bordering on tactless at <br/>
times. It is not letterboxing it is chatting about letterboxing. If <br/>
my frankness bothers you I'm sorry, but you have to realize that <br/>
there are some folks out there that did not do the same research <br/>
that you have done.<br/>
Choi referrenced in a previous post the Time magazine article and <br/>
how this list went into an almost anti newboxer mode. We(Gwen &amp; I) <br/>
lost over ten letterboxes in the first week after the article. None <br/>
in the several weeks prior and very few in the following weeks. That <br/>
certainly could have been dogs, squirrels, geocachers or <br/>
accidentally found but I believe the obvious was due to uniformed <br/>
new letterboxers. There is a learning curve.<br/>
Mark Pepe established the newboxer list at that time, and that has <br/>
really been beneficial to new boxers, and to the game itself. <br/>

Yes, there are good newbies.  They are usually the folks who actually<br/>
show up on an e-group or discussion list!  <br/>
<br/>
Please understand, no one is complaining about newbies - they are<br/>
complaining about newbies who don't follow good letterboxing etiquette.<br/>
 Most people who stay with the hobby a while develop good habits.  Yes,<br/>
some "seasoned" boxers might be responsible, but really - with the<br/>
recent spate of publicity, whom do you suspect is behind the spate of<br/>
missing, ill-hidden, not-reassembled-properly boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Let me be on the record as saying I welcome with open arms any newbie<br/>
who wants to play the game.  Just please remember, you're not the only<br/>
one who wants to enjoy that box!<br/>

After 3 of my boxes in an 8-box series went missing, I took the "kid<br/>
friendly" icon off my AQ listing (apparently, a troope of Girl Scouts were<br/>
the last ones to stamp in on the remaining boxes, and left them unhidden -<br/>
grrr!).  I may take the "drive by" icon off as well, altho I kinda wanted to<br/>
leave it there for boxers who are differently-abled.<br/>
<br/>
Next series will have harder clues...the first series were my first plants,<br/>
and also, there's not a lot of activity in this area, so I wanted to get<br/>
thing rolling.  The one I'm working on now has much more elaborate stamps,<br/>
and I'd hate to have them disappear.<br/>

It is very dishearting as a newbie to hear all these complaints.When <br/>
anything could happen to a box placed in a public location.<br/>
<br/>
Is not one of the original rules to place the little letterboxing <br/>
print out in each box with the rules so the finder knows what to do?<br/>

<br/>
I definitely think that the "kid-friendly" icon can be overused (there <br/>
are few boxes that do not tout this icon). I have definitely found <br/>
boxes in areas that I would not consider kid-friendly, especially to <br/>
letterboxing. But maybe it is the icon that is mis-understood. Kid-<br/>
friendly can mean different things to different people.<br/>
<br/>
Just because a child can access the box does not necissarily mean that <br/>
it is kid-friendly. Kids do not know how to be stealthy so if a box is <br/>
planted in a highly public area marking it a kid-friendly can be <br/>
asking for trouble. I recently found some boxes that even I had <br/>
trouble picking up without being caught because I was surrounded by <br/>
literally hundreds of people... in an area that is rarely not busy. <br/>
While these boxes were marked kid-friendly I would hardly want to take <br/>
a 6-year-old boxing with me in this area simply due to the chances of <br/>
being caught. <br/>
<br/>
Now I realize that this is not the case for all of the boxes that are <br/>
missing or not returned properly, but I think maybe we just need to be <br/>
more aware of how boxes are being labeled (keeping in mind that not <br/>
everyone is familiar enough with every location to know the <br/>
appropriateness ahead of time).<br/>

&gt; After 3 of my boxes in an 8-box series went missing, I took the "kid<br/>
&gt; friendly" icon off my AQ listing (apparently, a troope of Girl Scouts<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; the last ones to stamp in on the remaining boxes, and left them<br/>
&gt; unhidden -<br/>
&gt; grrr!).  I may take the "drive by" icon off as well, altho I kinda<br/>
&gt; wanted to<br/>
&gt; leave it there for boxers who are differently-abled.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Next series will have harder clues...the first series were my first<br/>
&gt; plants,<br/>
&gt; and also, there's not a lot of activity in this area, so I wanted to<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; thing rolling.  The one I'm working on now has much more elaborate<br/>

&gt; and I'd hate to have them disappear.<br/>

&gt; It is very dishearting as a newbie to hear all these complaints.When <br/>

If you are doing things properly, why are you worrying about it?  Don't<br/>
you want to be aware of what is happening, and what placers expect?  I<br/>
would think that would be why you are here...<br/>
<br/>
And yes, boxes are in public locations and anything can happen - tell<br/>
that to the folks who have had a box in place for 2 or 3 years, only to<br/>
have it disappear right after some poorly-written magazine articles<br/>
brings all the one-box wonders and non-attentive parents out of the<br/>
woodworks.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Is not one of the original rules to place the little letterboxing <br/>
&gt; print out in each box with the rules so the finder knows what to do?<br/>
<br/>
I have info in my boxes; some are briefer than others, as they are in<br/>
microboxes.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Complaining here about new letterboxers seems odd when you said that <br/>
&gt; the "bad" ones are rarely on the board.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, yeah.  This is a group for letterboxers to discuss issues of<br/>
importance; missing/misplaced/unhid/poorly reassembled boxes fall into<br/>
this category.  As does publicity.<br/>

&gt; I thought I might put in my 2-cents... <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I definitely think that the "kid-friendly" icon can be overused<br/>
&gt; (there <br/>
&gt; are few boxes that do not tout this icon). I have definitely found <br/>
&gt; boxes in areas that I would not consider kid-friendly, especially to <br/>
&gt; letterboxing. But maybe it is the icon that is mis-understood. Kid-<br/>
&gt; friendly can mean different things to different people.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just because a child can access the box does not necissarily mean<br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; it is kid-friendly. Kids do not know how to be stealthy so if a box<br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; planted in a highly public area marking it a kid-friendly can be <br/>
&gt; asking for trouble. I recently found some boxes that even I had <br/>
&gt; trouble picking up without being caught because I was surrounded by <br/>
&gt; literally hundreds of people... in an area that is rarely not busy. <br/>
&gt; While these boxes were marked kid-friendly I would hardly want to<br/>
&gt; take <br/>
&gt; a 6-year-old boxing with me in this area simply due to the chances of<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; being caught. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now I realize that this is not the case for all of the boxes that are<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; missing or not returned properly, but I think maybe we just need to<br/>
&gt; be <br/>
&gt; more aware of how boxes are being labeled (keeping in mind that not <br/>
&gt; everyone is familiar enough with every location to know the <br/>
&gt; appropriateness ahead of time).<br/>

  Yes, we realize that other things happen to letterboxes besides careless rehiders.  When I find my box out in the open with puncture marks 1" apart in the lid, I think "animal," not careless rehider.  But when I find my box with the Lock n Lock lid put on upside down...and a pack of Cub Scouts were the last finders....I think "hm, newbies.  Better check the rest of the series," and I consider myself fortunate to have gotten there before it rained again!<br/>

Hi Tammy<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure this would come under "Discretion", but particularly with <br/>
urban boxes there is a need not to have the whole troup go looking <br/>
for the letterbox.<br/>
We had 12 GS on an outing searching for our urban series in Seal <br/>
Beach, Ca and lost the stamp while they were stamping in. At least <br/>
we received a note and I found it on the ground in front of the bus <br/>
bench they were using. Letterboxes in the country can be sought in a <br/>
group, but urban boxes take a lot more stealth.<br/>

Good point.  I had this mental image of a gaggle of giggling Girl<br/>
Scouts in this very urban park, shouting and pointing and counting<br/>
steps out loud and generally being kids - fun for them perhaps, but not<br/>
very discreet.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to update my clues for this series one last time to add all<br/>
the good suggestions this thread has produced.  Thanks all!<br/>

No it was even worse. It was on a public sidewalk and they were <br/>
decoding a historical plaque next to a bus bench. The location is <br/>
right along the fencing for the harbor of the ammunition depot. Now I <br/>
grant you the nearness of the ammo depot probably is questionable due <br/>
to terrorism possibilities, but Seal Beach is a pretty small burg and <br/>
there are few urban possibilities for hiding letterboxes.<br/>
After decoding the plaque code they found the box directly behind the <br/>
historical plaque. In the end it worked out okay.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">just wanted to add a little tidbit about the Girl Scout complaints. <br/>
One of the reasons that my friend &amp; I started lb'ing was hearing <br/>
about it through our GS council. We are now completely addicted. <br/>
mostly we go with our own kids. We have taken our troop out in <br/>
public once on a quiet trail, and even then, I saw it was too much <br/>
excitement, etc. Breaking into smaller groups than the whole troop <br/>
going is probably best. Then they also get more of a chance to <br/>
figure out the clues and the full experience. <br/>
<br/>
 yes, as mentioned above- GS still preach "leave no trace" camping &amp; <br/>
hiking and definitely leaving things better than you found them. We <br/>
are constantly nagging our troop about this! most parents don't <br/>
instill these things to their children, that is one of the reasons I <br/>
enjoy being a leader, to influence them. (hopefully) :) <br/>
<br/>
Our council has hidden several boxes on their PRIVATE property, with <br/>
private clues, etc. The boxes there are not well hidden- due to the <br/>
fact that it is their own property, and they want the girls to be <br/>
able to find them- some harder than others. <br/>
<br/>
My friend/co-leader and I are going to hold a training session at <br/>
one of our leader's weekends, and I've also been asked to go to <br/>
another Service Unit's meeting to talk about it. I wasn't going to, <br/>
just bc I already have so much to do, but I may do it now after <br/>
reading this bc I truly think that most leaders care about these <br/>
things, especially respecting other people's property, nature, etc- <br/>
that is why they are leaders (I HOPE!) and that education eliminates <br/>
ignorance (or at least cuts down on it!) <br/>
<br/>
As also mentioned above they, as well as anyone else new to the <br/>
hobby may not realize how easily some curious passerby might take <br/>
the box, someone may look at it as littering, etc. whatever their <br/>
reasons. They also may not realize how people may not appreciate the <br/>
hobby, look at it as tresspassing, destroying, etc. also some <br/>
planters must keep this in mind as to how much traffic you are <br/>
sending off the trail and how far, and what damage may eventually <br/>
occur from that. I'm rambling now :)<br/>
<br/>
We try to scope out the place as we pull up (with our kids) and see <br/>
how visible, etc. They are mostly into the "spy" sneaky ness of it. <br/>
If it's an urban box, or a drive by, we usually have one or two of <br/>
us, instead of all 5 kids get out, and retrieve it, stamp in at the <br/>
car, then one or two to rehide. they are 6,7,8, and 9 (the two year <br/>
old doesn't do too much rehiding- he carves the stamps- haha) and <br/>
they all know to walk around the box, make sure leaves or debris are <br/>
covering it from all sides, etc. We've also picked up trash on <br/>
trails- so the kids- as long as properly supervised are okay and an <br/>
asset to letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
We as leaders also only have the troop use one page- we do one troop <br/>
stamp (hand carved) and the girls initial around it. The council <br/>
boxes also list this as one of their rules to use 1 page per troop. <br/>
<br/>
here in SC we have "fun" letterboxing patches that have no <br/>
requirements. it is the leaders decision how it is earned. Our <br/>
council has certificates to award a Gold if they find all private GS <br/>
boxes and at least two public boxes and silver if they find all <br/>
private GS boxes. <br/>
<br/>
all in all, if the leaders are correctly trained, first in the law <br/>
of Girl scouting (considerate, helpful, respect others, respect <br/>
authority, make the world a better place, leave no trace, leave <br/>
better than you found it, etc) then they make the ideal <br/>
letterboxers. :) <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You have beautifully summed up what I would hope would be the mindset of any<br/>
leader with respect to letterboxing.  I've also taught letterboxing to my<br/>
own Cub Scouts and have taken about three years getting them to the point<br/>
where I feel I can turn them out to hunt on their own knowing they will be<br/>
good boxers.<br/>
<br/>
I think that while the focus here has been on Girl Scouts, it applies to any<br/>
youth group that attempts letterboxing.  I think GS is being targeted in<br/>
these comments because they are the only group so far that has formalized<br/>
LB'ing into their program.<br/>
<br/>
Being a scout leader trainer myself, I believe firmly that training cures a<br/>
lot of wrongs in scouting.  This applies not just to girls but to leaders.<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned in a previous post, I believe the girls and leaders who<br/>
connect with the LB'ing community truly do make excellent letterboxers.  I<br/>
hope they (and you) become models for improving letterboxing among GS<br/>
troops.<br/>

Hi Tammy<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure this would come under "Discretion", but particularly with urban<br/>
boxes there is a need not to have the whole troup go looking for the<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
We had 12 GS on an outing searching for our urban series in Seal Beach, Ca<br/>
and lost the stamp while they were stamping in. At least we received a note<br/>
and I found it on the ground in front of the bus bench they were using.<br/>
Letterboxes in the country can be sought in a group, but urban boxes take a<br/>
lot more stealth.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Re: misplaced boxes<br/>
<br/>
just wanted to add a little tidbit about the Girl Scout complaints. <br/>
One of the reasons that my friend &amp; I started lb'ing was hearing about it<br/>
through our GS council. We are now completely addicted. <br/>
mostly we go with our own kids. We have taken our troop out in public once<br/>
on a quiet trail, and even then, I saw it was too much excitement, etc.<br/>
Breaking into smaller groups than the whole troop going is probably best.<br/>
Then they also get more of a chance to figure out the clues and the full<br/>
experience. <br/>
<br/>
 yes, as mentioned above- GS still preach "leave no trace" camping &amp; hiking<br/>
and definitely leaving things better than you found them. We are constantly<br/>
nagging our troop about this! most parents don't instill these things to<br/>
their children, that is one of the reasons I enjoy being a leader, to<br/>
influence them. (hopefully) :) <br/>
<br/>
Our council has hidden several boxes on their PRIVATE property, with private<br/>
clues, etc. The boxes there are not well hidden- due to the fact that it is<br/>
their own property, and they want the girls to be able to find them- some<br/>
harder than others. <br/>
<br/>
My friend/co-leader and I are going to hold a training session at one of our<br/>
leader's weekends, and I've also been asked to go to another Service Unit's<br/>
meeting to talk about it. I wasn't going to, just bc I already have so much<br/>
to do, but I may do it now after reading this bc I truly think that most<br/>
leaders care about these things, especially respecting other people's<br/>
property, nature, etc- that is why they are leaders (I HOPE!) and that<br/>
education eliminates ignorance (or at least cuts down on it!) <br/>
<br/>
As also mentioned above they, as well as anyone else new to the hobby may<br/>
not realize how easily some curious passerby might take the box, someone may<br/>
look at it as littering, etc. whatever their reasons. They also may not<br/>
realize how people may not appreciate the hobby, look at it as tresspassing,<br/>
destroying, etc. also some planters must keep this in mind as to how much<br/>
traffic you are sending off the trail and how far, and what damage may<br/>
eventually occur from that. I'm rambling now :)<br/>

I did a lot of reading before I ever went out looking. I read everything I could find. And I <br/>
am a smarty pants. I like research and knowing "the rules." Definitely not a clueless kind of <br/>
person. So after a few weeks of thinking about it, then I went out. I didn't stamp bc I <br/>
wanted to see if I could find it first. I was very careful. I hid it very well, just like I found it. <br/>
Etc.<br/>
<br/>
After a couple months, stumbled across some "code of ethics" and found out I have <br/>
"violated" it bc *gasp* I told my family and friends I was a letterboxer. Apparently I was <br/>
supposed to hide that. Be stealthy. Whatever.<br/>

Anyway, I think yes the complaining can be taken personally if it seems directed at one's <br/>
particulars. But I don't take it personally. I think what most people are concerned about is <br/>
taking the time and effort to create and hide a box and that box or its contents not <br/>
respected. If I or any "new" person respect the effort and do what we can to see that the <br/>
box doesn't go missing or get ruined due to our thoughtlessness, that is all anyone can <br/>
ask. And really anything outside of that -- like taking your dog with you, or letting your <br/>
kids stamp the book --  is no one's business but yours.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, some of the posts I have read on some of the sites and some of the terminology <br/>
used seems to me to be very exclusionary -- "us" vs "them." But again, whatever. I don't <br/>
have to like it.<br/>
<br/>
That is my own opinion, anyway.<br/>

&gt; I am one of these so called "new letterboxers" that every one is <br/>
&gt; complaining about. I have been only involed for less than a month <br/>
&gt; BUT I did my home work. I researched the "RULES" that you all <br/>
&gt; follow. I explained the rules to my son.I searched out the boxes and <br/>
&gt; rehid them well.I dried all contents and replaced well in their <br/>
&gt; bags.I am respectful of the time and effort that was put into the <br/>
&gt; box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You guys are almost scaring me out of this all though.God forbid I <br/>
&gt; ever find one of your boxes that a squirll or a dog found and have <br/>
&gt; to take the blame. We are not talking about the Amazon jungle here <br/>
&gt; where no man has gone before.Things happen,the wind blows, people <br/>
&gt; explore,dogs sniff around.<br/>

On a very busy walking path the other day I had to retrieve a box from<br/>
a tree right next to the path. I set my two year-old a little way off<br/>
and played hide-and-seek with her - a perfect excuse to duck down<br/>
behind that selfsame tree. I mean, I knew having kids would be handy<br/>
in my dotage but who knew the payoff would come this quickly?<br/>
