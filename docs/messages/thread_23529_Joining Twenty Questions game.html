<br/>
I don't tend to follow the boards much, but I was made aware of the <br/>
Twenty Questions game going on here and decided to take a look ...<br/>
<br/>
There is at least one letterbox already at Rocky Narrows in <br/>
Sherborn, so I've had occassion to traverse there (as others likely <br/>
have also).<br/>
<br/>
Rocky Narrows is divided into two distinct sections that are <br/>
seperated by a set of railroad tracks.  Officially, it is prohibited <br/>
to cross the tracks (although a trail does seem to do exactly that).<br/>
<br/>
It's actually not that large of a tract of land, but hard to narrow <br/>
the location down with one remaining question.  Sure wish this was <br/>
25 questions instead!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think Boston Rott has the right idea by trying to <br/>
coordinate the Trustees' intersection referencing system with a map <br/>
of stone walls.<br/>
<br/>
As Blax points out, part of Rocky Narrows is also owned by the town <br/>
of Sherborn.<br/>
<br/>
A wild guess, but I'd be inclined to say that this box is likely on <br/>
the northern side of the tracks (intersections 8 and up).<br/>
<br/>
I concur that Boston Rott should ask the last question ... as with <br/>
one question left what better chance do we have then to try to <br/>
narrow down near which intersection the box happens to be on?<br/>
<br/>
Fire away!<br/>
