<br/>
We're just new to this wonderful hobby - been at it for a month now <br/>
and have already racked up a TON of road miles here in CA  and NV! <br/>
We're curious as to the status of these 2 boxes - NATONAS OAKS in <br/>
Sacramento (we spent an hour in the park and never found a smidgen!<br/>
<br/>
Also, we spent nearly as long in Old Auburn looking for the AUburn <br/>
box - any help there would be greatly appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Finally - for all of our Centaal and Northern CA neighbours - we will <br/>
be placing a bunch of boxes in and around the Yuba City/Marysville <br/>
area!<br/>

Yuba City and Marysville are MY old stomping grounds. Lived there for 20 <br/>
years and return often so will be looking forward to finding your boxes.<br/>
<br/>
As for Natomas Oaks: found it last spring and thought the clues were pretty <br/>
good if a little tricky. It's a micro box so, very tiny. Auburn is another <br/>
story. Been there 4 times and can't find it. The owner is gone too so no help <br/>
there. Why not try our I-80 series Auburn box. Much easier and fore interesting if <br/>
you like history!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you're coming to the Nor Cal gathering next Saturday!!<br/>

hitchhiking seeds are gone - I was covered in them! The box owners <br/>
live (or lived) near by so it should be well maintained. I'm <br/>
guessing it is still there.<br/>
