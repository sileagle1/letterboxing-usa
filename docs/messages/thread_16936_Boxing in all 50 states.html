Would anyone be interested in getting a special stamp when you reach that goal? (Similar in principal to the F-100, F-500 &amp; P-100 milestone stamps recently sent out). I already have an image in mind. <br/>

If you would be interested, let me know. If you have REACHED that goal and are interested, be sure to let me know that as well.<br/>
