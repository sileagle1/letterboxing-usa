Here are a few ideas.<br/>
Just north on Hwy 14, listed in Kern Co., you will find 10 Million <br/>
Dollar Baby, a drive by in Mojave. Just a bit further North is Desert <br/>
Tortoise another Drive by. At the junction of Hwy 14 and 178 you will <br/>
find two drive bys and access to two other in the Coyote Hole Stage <br/>
Robbery.<br/>
Burro Schmidt Tunnel is also nearby but we believe it may be missing <br/>
and you might need 4 wheel drive to reach it. There are two boxes in <br/>
Red Rock Canyon near the Desert Tortoise.<br/>
<br/>
South of Lancaster is a very old box called Robbers Roost and it has <br/>
been several years since we visited it.<br/>
<br/>
There are some others in the Lancaster area but we have never looked <br/>
for them.<br/>
<br/>
Now if you want to spend the day in Kernville (about 1 1/2 hours from <br/>
Rosamond) we can keep you busy for several days.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the suggestions. I would love to spend the day letterboxing, unfortunately I only <br/>
have time for a few. I fly into LA on Friday afternoon and fly out on Monday afternoon. <br/>
Such a shame 'cause there are so many boxes in the area. <br/>
I'm gonna try to get the ones you've listed though. If you think of one I should absolutely not <br/>
visit the area without getting let me know. Thanks.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, the Antelope Valley and western Mojave Desert do have some fine<br/>
LB opportunities :-)  I would agree with Don's suggestions, but let me<br/>
add a couple of comments...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Just north on Hwy 14, listed in Kern Co., you will find 10 Million <br/>
&gt; Dollar Baby, a drive by in Mojave. <br/>
<br/>
Be careful with this one!  Highway 14 is quite busy here, and there is<br/>
not much parking in the area: narrow shoulders.  I found it a lot<br/>
easier to pass it when headed north, and got it while headed south. <br/>
If you go to Red Rock Canyon SP, I would definitely suggest doing it<br/>
that way: grab it *after* the Park.<br/>
<br/>
In Red Rock Canyon are two LBs that are worth a look: Red Rock, and<br/>
Dry Waterfall Letterbox Ver. 2.0.  We've not gotten the latter,<br/>
although I spent a couple of hours working on the first version, and<br/>
got nothing for it, but the walk was certainly worth it!  These are<br/>
both in Hagen Canyon, which has a parking pullout south of the<br/>
campground, right off CA Route 14.  The main trail through the canyon<br/>
is well-marked and worth taking an hour or two for, and the Red Rock<br/>
box is just a few paces off the trail.<br/>
<br/>
If you are a rail fan, then you really want to go after the Famous<br/>
Tehachapi Loop boxes west of Tehachapi.  If you get really lucky, a<br/>
train will be coming through the loop, but even if not, the loop is a<br/>
stunning engineering feat.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Burro Schmidt Tunnel is also nearby but we believe it may be missing <br/>
&gt; and you might need 4 wheel drive to reach it. <br/>
<br/>
Last I looked (which has admittedly been more than a year), the tunnel<br/>
was open to foot traffic, and the box should be accessible that way,<br/>
although things can change in the desert.  Bring a flashlight or three<br/>
if you do this one.<br/>
<br/>
And there is one LB in Rosamund, itself: Feline Friends<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, if you are interested in The Degree Confluence<br/>
Project, N35 by W118 is a few miles west of Mojave, just south of CA<br/>
58, on good dirt roads.  It's one of the most-visited Confluences in<br/>
the world, as it is very easy to reach.  This assumes possession of a<br/>
GPSr, either hand-held or vehicle-installed.  It's not on AF land. <br/>
There is a geocache nearby.  One of these days, I'm going to plant an<br/>
LB nearby, one which will require standing on the confluence to get<br/>
started.<br/>
<br/>
If you get the urge to actually leave an LB some place in the AV, be<br/>
assured that there are several of us who will keep an eye on it :-)<br/>
<br/>
Final note: prepare for very warm weather during the day, but cool in<br/>
the evenings.  June can be quite variable in the Antelope Valley;<br/>
we'll put in a request for sunny days with high clouds and a nice<br/>
breeze for your visit, but no guarantees that anyone will actually<br/>
read the request! ;-)<br/>

<br/>
There is a good dirt road that parallels Hwy 14 so that parking isn't <br/>
required on the shoulder of the road. The clues advise where to find <br/>
the connection to the dirt road.<br/>
