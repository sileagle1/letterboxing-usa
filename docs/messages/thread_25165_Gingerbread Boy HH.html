If this is yours please email off list if you want me to mail this log book back to you.<br/>

Or maybe you found the stamp in your backpack and thought it was a cootie?  It was a very nice carve (as per the cover.)  <br/>

I think it's listed on both AQ and LbNA. Here is a link to the AQ listing: http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=77074 <br/>
