posted in these sections, or plan to, please read this.<br/>
<br/>
     I've used this area as a quasi-website for some time, as it was easy to <br/>
upload to, and didn't require the time and expense of a real website.  Since <br/>
the group has grown, the area has become increasingly utilized.  I'll be <br/>
taking most of my files off it to open up space for the group.  Anyone with <br/>
an interest in the hints or clues I've got there should grab a copy in the <br/>
next few days.  This will alleviate the problem in the short term.  The <br/>
following suggestions will help make the most of the file (20M... currently <br/>
95%) and photo (30M...currently 60%) storage areas allocated to the group by <br/>
Yahoo:<br/>
<br/>
    There are a good many photos in the file section.  These could be moved <br/>
to the larger and logical photo section.<br/>
<br/>
     Most digital cameras take pictures at a resolution (and file size) much <br/>
greater than needed for display on a computer screen.  Most pictures should <br/>
be scaled to about 100kb, which gives ample size to be viewed on a computer.<br/>
<br/>
     Screen resolution is 72pdi.  Most scanners and cameras are operating at <br/>
200-300 dpi.  This means that the image appears three to four times larger <br/>
than actual when displayed on screen.  File sizes are even larger than three <br/>
or four times.  Scan at 72dpi, or use a photoshop program to change the <br/>
resolution and scale.<br/>
<br/>
     As the space fills up, pictures from old events should be taken down to <br/>
make space for new ones.<br/>
<br/>
     Some people have posted their event pictures on their personal <br/>
webspace, and linked them to the site.  This is great, when possible, as it <br/>
preserves the communal space for those who don't have a webspace.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     I suppose that it's time for me to create a website of my own.  I'd <br/>
rather spend my time making boxes than manipulating dead electrons, but I <br/>
suppose that this is the best solution for me.  While I applaud the new <br/>
self-serve database site, the current format is text only, which doesn't <br/>
work well for me.  Wes will be busy for some time getting the new one in <br/>
shape, but eventually, it would be great if the site would allow users to <br/>
attach files as part of the clue.  That's possible now if you have a <br/>
webspace to link to, so I'll be looking to make one and move my files there.<br/>
<br/>
     Finally, thank you Wes for your hard work in creating the new site.  It <br/>
never made any sense to me that some of the best box makers were recruited <br/>
to be webmaster/data input slaves.  Perhaps we'll get some great new boxes <br/>
now that they have more time to play.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Files and Photos sections, suggestions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;      It seems that the Files section of the Yahoo Talklist is nearly full<br/>
&gt; again.  Randy's call to clean out the cruft went largely unheeded, so I'll<br/>
&gt; put it out there again, along with some suggestions.  If you have anything<br/>
