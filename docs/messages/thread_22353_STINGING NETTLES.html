If you brush against them, you'll feel a stinging irritation for about a<br/>
half hour or so, whether you do anything or not.  Jewelweed is the most<br/>
common plant cited to help get rid of the irritation, and frequently grows<br/>
nearby.  But if you do nothing, it'll pass away in a half hour or so.<br/>
Interestingly, if you recognize it in time and grasp the plant with a firm<br/>
grasp, you won't be bothered by it at all.<br/>
<br/>
The last two times I encountered it, it was growing right in front of a<br/>
letterbox I was reaching for, one in Ireland, and one in Indiana.  I am<br/>
quite familiar with the plant, having encountered it many times, but while I<br/>
notice poison ivy and avoid it always, nettles seem to grow under my radar<br/>
and I blunder into them before I see them.<br/>
<br/>
If you can keep from rubbing the stinging area, and keep hands off, it<br/>
passes over more quickly.<br/>

Yes, the stinging will stop on its own eventually (the tingling lasts <br/>
several hours on my sensitive skin), but children are often less <br/>
patient than we are!<br/>
