Difficulty - fairly simple<br/>
Time - almost a drive up once you arrive at the parking area. <br/>
Directions to starting place - K-156 to K-4 west.  Look for a sign<br/>
for Cheyenne Bottoms on your left.  If you come in from any other<br/>
side of the reserve, make your way to the parking area north of pool <br/>
3A.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Details you should know - This is an incredible bird and wildlife <br/>
preserve.  You could spend a long time here hiking or bird watching <br/>
from your vehicle.  The web address is <br/>
http://www.cheyennebottoms.net/. It's well worth checking out before <br/>
you visit.  <br/>
<br/>
Details you don't need to know, but might enjoy - The day I was there <br/>
I saw 15-20 different kinds of birds, some I knew, some I'd never<br/>
seen before. <br/>
