<br/>
<br/>
Placed a new Box which will likely be the first stop on my <br/>
Revolutionary War Series of Waterford, New London and Groton, Ct., <br/>
But as of now is a stand alone box, The storyline is written as a <br/>
setup for the series, Hope you enjoy,<br/>
<br/>
Chip.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: EASY!!!<br/>
Special Instructions: remember this conversation took place 200 years <br/>
ago! The wall was in the middle of two fields now it's in a rather <br/>
residential setting so take care in the finding and rehiding of this <br/>
box, please!<br/>
<br/>
Jebidiah Perkins' is finishing up the fall harvest as news of the <br/>
Town Meeting has reached him by means of Charles Gardner, (whose <br/>
family home now stands at 160 Niles Hill Rd, but was originally <br/>
located in Jordan Village)the two founding fathers discuss their <br/>
obvious discontent with the British rule.<br/>
<br/>
"Well, Jeb, I was traveling the highway between the village and East <br/>
Great Neck when I took a left down by your son Braman's place, going <br/>
to my landholding by the Old Pepperbox, I never thought you'd finish <br/>
it, but that stone wall is rather large. It's a good thing those <br/>
rascal English have not as yet decided to tax the very stones in the <br/>
walls themselves, or you would be in the Poorhouse down Saybrooke <br/>
Way."<br/>
"Aye, Charles from the start 4/10 of a mile down the road all the way <br/>
back to the village, took me seasons to complete, but the wall is <br/>
there to stay forever. My oxen were ever so pleased to be done with <br/>
that job, only thing is, I've this nagging feeling about leaving <br/>
something in the wall two paces to the left of a small Gin Berry bush <br/>
and two chains or so in front of the opening I left so you could get <br/>
to your landholding. If I remember to do so I'll ask someone to go <br/>
find it for me.... I hope them Brits don't find it before then... I <br/>
may have left some important papers in there for the school master in <br/>
New London. Do you know young Master Hale from Coventry?"<br/>
"Aye, I do, so Charles, will you be going to the meeting at the <br/>
Village Schoolhouse?"<br/>
"Wouldn't want to miss the start of an uprising!"<br/>
