Also, your idea about planting in Nevada City and Hwy 20 are great.  But we <br/>

We found I-80 series Box#4 first!! then we looked for Patty reed's<br/>
doll, but the kids in the heat of the moment counted the faces<br/>
incorrectly and we ran out of time to look further. We will get it<br/>
next time.<br/>
We found next I-80 series Box#2 (on our way home) We had lots of fun<br/>
and will be getting down to other boxes around your neck of the woods.<br/>
Also I hope to get to the Sutter boxes I'm there hunting often...<br/>
Thanks for the fun!! I hope to see you some time.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, your idea about planting in Nevada City and Hwy 20 are great.<br/>
 But we <br/>
