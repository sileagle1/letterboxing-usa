use- is that when the tick withdraws because it is suffocating <br/>
(which does indeed make it easier for you) it is also regurgitating <br/>
it's toxins into you.  The thing is, you want to get it out BEFORE <br/>
it has a chance to voluntarily withdraw from your body, which is why <br/>
you need to forcibly remove it with tweezers.  I know it is more <br/>
painful, but it is MUCH more safe for you &amp; your family.  By using <br/>
Vaseline you are MUCH MORE LIKELY to be voluntarily giving yourself <br/>
any nasty germs than tick is carrying around.  Please take the extra <br/>
time, give yourself the extra pinch, &amp; get out the tweezers instead <br/>
of the vaseline.  You do not want to be responsible for giving <br/>
yourself or your children an icky disease like Lyme when it could've <br/>
been avoided with a little tug.  Will Vaseline work- absolutely, but <br/>
it also completely defeats the purpose of pulling the tick out in <br/>
the first place- you might as well let him feast &amp; release whenever <br/>
he wants to.<br/>

we've been<br/>
&gt; using Vaseline for years and haven't had a problem -- just make <br/>
sure you<br/>
&gt; pull them out when they start to back out.  Tweezers work fine <br/>
too, but you<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Having just written tick procedures for my Girl Scouting Service <br/>
&gt; Unit, I found that Vasaline, matches, etc are not the preferred <br/>
&gt; method for removing ticks. According to the CDC the best method is <br/>
&gt; to use a pair of tweezers and pull the tick out.  It was found <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; they tend to "regurgitate" less when using the tweezer method.  <br/>
Upon <br/>
&gt; removal of the tick, attach it to an index card and note where on <br/>
&gt; the body it was found and date it.  That way if there was a <br/>
&gt; reaction, you would have the tick available to give to the <br/>
Doctor.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for the vacination mentioned in the previous post, apparently <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; manufacturer has discontinued production.   <br/>
