<p>     I just got a really nasty note from Martha.  Nothing that I could possibly post to the list, but can't she hurl an epithet!  She told me that she's done with us whiney folks (not her exact choice of words), and I can stick her stamp... well, I'm sure you get it.  She told me that she's going to leave it in one of my boxes. I don't want the damn thing.  I'd just as soon put this whole sorry scandal behind me.  So I'm sending it out into the world... as a hitchhiker.  I don't <i>ever </i>want to see it again, so I'm scaling it off to the Gauche Coast. Fun'og... <em>catch</em>.</p>
<p>     <em>Footnote: It is my sincere hope that some unscrupulous and naive newbie will eventually pocket this stamp (believing it to be authentic).  Eventually, it could end up on the future equivalent of e-bay, where perhaps the Smithsonian will buy it up for their collection of Americana.  Should this unlikely chain of events occur, I expect Pat and Wingfoot to bite their tongues and smirk with the rest of us.</em></p>
<p>Enjoy these halcyon days. I certainly am.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, clearly, Ron gets the door prize.  I'll try to do better about listing the state.</p></div></div><br clear="all"/><hr/>MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <a href="http://g.msn.com/1HM305401/15">Click Here</a><br/></body></html>

Leger de Maine, that was fantastic!I just finally got around to <br/>
reading all the postings at one time (now, that's what I call <br/>
mileage!), and I laughed so much I got butterflies! Thank you so much <br/>
for "lightening" and "brightening" our lives! You're a wonder! Love,<br/>

this prank (mayself included)  The reason this joke<br/>

Can't you just picture Martha doing Letterboxing 101<br/>
on her - It's a Good Thing segment?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry folks, it still scares me!<br/>

Oh, and congrats to Ron on the door prize!  That was a<br/>
good one!<br/>
