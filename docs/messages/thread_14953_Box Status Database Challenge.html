Why would you want to do this? With enough data, the <br/>
database will offer one spot where you can stop before<br/>
boxing to check box reports. You can sort on any of the <br/>
fields by clicking on the field name. You can search by<br/>
entering your search term in the box at the top right with<br/>
the button for some reason labeled "This Table". The data<br/>
can be imported into Excel for a file that can be used<br/>
off-line.<br/>
<br/>
The fields are:<br/>
Box Name<br/>
State<br/>
City<br/>
Date<br/>
Finder<br/>
Status<br/>
Comments<br/>
<br/>
To add a record: <br/>
Click on Database in the lefthand menu on the Letterbox-usa <br/>
Group website.<br/>
Click on the Box Status. <br/>
Click on the Add Record button. <br/>
Enter the data you wish to add. <br/>
Click on Add Record. <br/>
<br/>
Please give it a try.<br/>

<br/>
The database seems very well done. However, in my experience, there <br/>
is already a single place I check before I go boxing to see if <br/>
anything is wrong with any boxes...the main list itself. The search <br/>
feature makes it easy to search through all posts to find info you <br/>
want. Plus, it's nice to go to just one place for ALL boxing related <br/>
comments, narratives, opinions. It also seems easier when posting <br/>
narratives or status reports to simply create a new post and type in <br/>
your narrative rather than have to type in all the extra location <br/>
information about every box I find. I'd rather just talk <br/>
about "boxing in xyz area and these are the boxes I found and their <br/>
condition".<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents. It seems that the original light-hearted banter <br/>
about the TERM "sitrep" has turned into an issue with the actual <br/>
POSTING of narratives about letterboxing adventure. Most comments <br/>
I've seen indicate that folks enjoy such stories...<br/>

But that doesn't mean we can't have both the LbNA website search site<br/>

"If you post it, they will read it"<br/>

This is EXCELLENT! Just what this site needed. Tomorrow, I'm adding the 15 we <br/>
found this weekend in CA and OR.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the effort!<br/>
