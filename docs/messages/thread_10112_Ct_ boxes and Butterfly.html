   Butterfly, you are the most beautiful and amazing Creature I <br/>
know ! I admire, I respect, and I adore you. But you must be very <br/>
careful in the Winter. We want you out there in that Magical Time of <br/>
Spring when the Pixies are about.<br/>
   Slow Camel knows that Butterfly would not want others to know that<br/>
our Butterfly took a hard spill today but Slow Camel "tells on" <br/>
Butterfly out of Love and Concern. And if this Camel had been with <br/>
Butterfly, we would have been going at a very S-L-O-W pace, perhaps <br/>
even holding hands. We would do the "careful walk" in this white <br/>
stuff. (Camels prefer sand but we like to letterbox so much, we will <br/>
go just about anywhere)<br/>
   Please, if you are close to Butterfly and you love her, please ask <br/>
her to be careful. She cannot refuse us all. Her heart is too BIG to <br/>
say "no" to us. We know that Butterfly has gotten over 500 boxes but <br/>
there is no rush in Wintertime. We are not asking that you stop, only <br/>
that you practice- Easy Does It, My Dear Friend.<br/>
   Respectfully,<br/>
    Slow camel<br/>

I  am FINE!!! Really/ Not to worry. I was not rushing, I stepped out of<br/>
the car on some wet and slippery ice,  it is true that I was on my way<br/>
to find Tyler Two box, but also was carrying a sled for this snow is too<br/>
wonderful to waste. The wind caught the sled and me off balance and<br/>
oops. Like some stamps, I was upside down. !! Camel please stop<br/>
fretting, I will be out tomorrow trying to plant part of a new series<br/>
coming out on the Giant. Hint hint. It is not a mystery, as I am not too<br/>
swift on writing mysteries as you will know if you look for Peep Peep.<br/>

Camel crawl over dangerous rocks near steep legdes. <wink> Methinks <br/>
Butterfly must not get so focused on the find that she forgets her <br/>

lecturing Bluebird about flying alone!).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">O.K. everyone--I must confess that I did not fall while searching for a<br/>
letterbox. I was actually going sledding and there just happens to be a<br/>
letterbox RIGHT There!<br/>
Fact:  I never go hiking alone, as Bluebird knows. I was with Angel when<br/>
I fell, so what better person to be with. ? This morning I am no stiffer<br/>
than usual and that is good news for someone soon to be 72.  I do want<br/>
to thank Chuck and Aili and Camel and Lobsta and other well wishers for<br/>
your kind concern. I have heard tell that Camels spit, well our kind and<br/>
wonderful slow Camel was fast to 'spit' out my 'downfall' [grin] . As<br/>
for the number of boxes I have found, please know that for me the hikes<br/>
and walks and friends I go with, mean  much more than that number that<br/>
keeps on growing. I love to look through my log books full of colorful<br/>
beautiful stamps, all of which have fond memories attached. I truly do<br/>
not know my F.or X count, but am proud of my slowly growing P.count and<br/>
dream of them giving pleasure to others.<br/>
Happy butterfly wishes<br/>
