Macsville, Virginia<br/>
September 15, 2002<br/>
places by the Apple Dumpling Gang<br/>
<br/>
Note: This is not on a hike, but a perfect destination to drive to in <br/>
the country and have a wonderful picnic. Lot's of open, flat space <br/>
for lawn games like croquet and fixed areas like tennis courts, BBQ <br/>
pits and baseball fields.  Also, Middleberg is a great town to shop <br/>
around in.<br/>
<br/>
Take Rt. 50 to Macsville. (it's between Aldin &amp; Middelberg VA) Turn <br/>
onto Rt. 627 (the only way you can) and find Mickie Gordon Memorial <br/>
Park less than a mile down the road.<br/>
<br/>
Park in the first lot on the left by the pavilion and walk past the <br/>
pond on your right, through a break in the trees and into the next <br/>
field.  Follow along the bushes to your right and spy the larger of <br/>
two trees standing out in the open area of the field at that end.  <br/>
the box is behind the larger one on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Great place for a picnic right?<br/>
