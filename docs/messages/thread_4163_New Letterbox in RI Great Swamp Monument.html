GREAT SWAMP MONUMENT LETTERBOX<br/>
WEST KINGSTON, RHODE ISLAND<br/>
<br/>
PLACED: January 11, 2002<br/>
            By Kokopelli<br/>
<br/>
DRIVING DIRECTIONS: Take Rt. 2 South into West Kingston.  About 1 mile past <br/>
the junction of Rt. 138, look for the old white historical marker Great Swamp <br/>
Monument on the left, just past Liberty Lane.  At the sign, take a left onto <br/>
Great Swamp Monument Drive (a bumpy dirty road) and drive to the end.  Park <br/>
in the circular parking area.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  From the parking area follow the old road easterly out to the <br/>
monument, which is about a half-mile walk.  The monument is placed at the <br/>
sight of the Great Swamp Massacre of Sunday, December 19, 1975.  During King <br/>
Philips War the Narragansetts took refuge on this piece of high ground in the <br/>
swamp.  They would have been well protected from their enemies but a cold <br/>
spell froze the waters of the swamp.  The Colonist led by Benjamin Church, <br/>
marched across the ice and charged the encampment setting it on fire and <br/>
killing almost 1,000 Narragansetts, many of them women and children.  The <br/>
monument is a huge granite monolith ringed by 4 granite stones representing <br/>
the colonial regiment.<br/>
    Stand at the North side of the monolith.  Walk 42 paces at 10 to reach a <br/>
small deer trail on your right.  There is a white pine at 45 of great girth <br/>
about 15 feet from where you stand.  Bushwhack in to unearth a slice of <br/>
history on the north side of the tree under a stone.<br/>
