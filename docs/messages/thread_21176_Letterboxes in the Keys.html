Gray days on Nantucket getting you down? I'd trade places with you! Although <br/>
central CA has been getting its share of gray skies lately. Have a good trip!<br/>

I emailed you off-list, but then I got curious and went to LBNA and <br/>
found there are 5 letterboxes on Key West alone. Just be sure to <br/>
click on Southwest Florida and that will take you to Monroe County <br/>
and all the boxes in the Keys. Let me know how mine is doing!<br/>

The Hemingway letterbox and Key West letterbox (which are steps from <br/>
each other) were alive and well when I was there in October :)  -Q<br/>
