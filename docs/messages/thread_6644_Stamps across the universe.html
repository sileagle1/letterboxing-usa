find. (Elmer, with 13, 16, and 17 year old women in the family, I hear you! <br/>
One devious trick I've learned to get them out letterboxing is to include <br/>
their friends (for the 13) and boyfriends (for the elder gals). They love <br/>
showing off their woodcraft and despite their teenage Abercrombe &amp; Fitch <br/>
sense of cool, still delight in the discovery of "finds").<br/>
