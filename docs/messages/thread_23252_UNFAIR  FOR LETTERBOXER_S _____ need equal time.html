There is no reason why you can't do both at once since many are near or <br/>
beside your targets.<br/>

Nah!  We'll just let them think that.  I once read a newspaper interview with <br/>
Jon Bon Jovi (gaaaaaaaaah...  love that man almost as much as I love Davy <br/>
Jones...) wherein he said that he really doesn't mind it when people make fun of <br/>
New Jersey.  "Let's just keep it our little secret.  We've got beautiful <br/>
beaches, lots of farmland and forests, lots of culture and access to two of the <br/>
greatest cities in the US...  New York and Philadelphia!  I don't mind if we keep <br/>
that to ourselves."<br/>
<br/>
(I paraphrased his quote, but that's OK)<br/>
<br/>
So... let's just keep letterboxing another best-kept secret for as long as we <br/>
can.  :)<br/>

&gt; I look at it like this:   In the 30-40 days since I started <br/>
&gt; letterboxing, not only have I been to places I only drive by, Today <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; found the graves of several of my cousins that were 'lost' until I <br/>
&gt; found a box by Trailtracker that was placed beside them in a <br/>
cemetery <br/>
&gt; tree.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not the only one! We were on a Lake Michigan circle tour and we <br/>
found a family headstone and two graves that might be from a branch of <br/>
my family.  It was an amazing day!<br/>
