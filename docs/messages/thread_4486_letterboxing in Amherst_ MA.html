our UMass fledgling put us on the trails.  After picking up subs in <br/>
downtown Amherst we headed straight for the Mt. Pollux letterbox (Bob <br/>
was hungry so it had to be quick!)  We picnicked at the southermost <br/>
tree enjoying the view. Then the hunt. The handmade stamp was <br/>
artfully designed - a beauty. Then off to the Notch Visitor Center.  <br/>
We took the warnings about icy cliffs seriously and stayed on <br/>
relatively level ground.  Chipmunk on the Run is no longer frozen in <br/>
and Hide and Seek Cat was begging to be found. All boxes are in good <br/>
shape.  Looking through the stamp books I noticed a stamp that <br/>
read "NA MASTE".  I don't know what that means but when I pronounce <br/>
it, it sounds like the name of a group my sister belonged to whose <br/>
mission was to reach out and help others in the community.  If the <br/>
owner of this stamp is listening can you tell me about your stamp? <br/>
There were a lot of other interesting stamps in the journals we found <br/>
today. My favorite was one of a walking skeleton though it looked too <br/>
intricate to be hand carved.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello!  Glad you had fun in Amherst yesterday!  I agree, the Mt. Pollux <br/>
stamp is wonderful.  And I can also explain the origin of the "Namaste" <br/>
stamp. It belongs to my travelling partner, JLR.  "Namaste" (pronounced <br/>
"Naah-maah-stay") is Sanskrit and it means "The divine in me honors the <br/>
divine in you."  It's used as a greeting or a goodbye in India, and is also <br/>
a standard beginning or end to a Yoga practice.  The rest of my partner's <br/>
stamp is a woman sitting peacefully in a yoga pose called Sukhasana <br/>
(basically, she's sitting cross-legged).  Thanks for asking, and Namaste! :)<br/>
