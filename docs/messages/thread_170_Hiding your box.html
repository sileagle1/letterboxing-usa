                    <div class="plaintext-content">I sent out a note yesterday suggesting plugging as an alternate<br/>
way to hide your box.  This entails making a hole beneath a plug<br/>
of sod and hiding your box inside of it.  No reason you can't do<br/>
this without causing undue damage to the earth.  Just be careful.<br/>
Don't make a big obnoxious hole.  And make sure the clue points <br/>
them right to the very spot: Like "Look 5 inches to the left of<br/>
the white pointed rock for a plug of sod." That way they won't be<br/>
trying to dig up a spot where your box aint.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to make an important point here:<br/>
There shouldn't be any reason that we have to exactly mimick the <br/>
Dartmoor conventions asserted by Michael Gladney, Trevor Dallas or<br/>
others.  These are merely conventions as they stated.  They're not rules.  And<br/>
According to Adrian (the only Dartmoor letterboxer in<br/>
our group) plugging is a current mode to hide a Dartmoor letterbox.<br/>
So for those of you who'd like to adhere more closely to the way<br/>
they are doing it in Dartmoor, feel free to plug away.<br/>
<br/>
But even if nobody in Dartmoor was doing it it does not mean that<br/>
we can't try it here.  We can try whatever new methods we want.<br/>
Just use common sense, respect property, etc.  It'll keep us <br/>
creative if we try new things.  That's a big part of the fun<br/>
I think.  I hope we keep trying different things and continue<br/>
to experiment.  But always use common sense and NEVER create<br/>
a dangerous situation for the letterbox hunter.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure there will be other ways than plugging to make sure your<br/>
box is well hidden.  Plugging sounded like a good one to me and I<br/>
plan to try it with my next letterbox.  But there will be other<br/>
creative ways to do it.  If you come up with a way of your own<br/>
that has not been mentioned maybe you can share it.  Did <br/>
someone say they hid a letterbox under water?  Was that Rachael,<br/>
the 20 year old Evanstonian girl with the lonely letterbox<br/>
that I promised to stamp someday?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,<br/>
the general idea is to avoid unintentional discovery.  Plugging<br/>
is one way.  Maybe you can make a stamp look so like a tree knot<br/>
as to defy discovery.  That would be another way.  Also, Adrian's suggestion to<br/>
merely put the letterbox a bit off of the main trail<br/>
is another good way to avoid unintentional discovery. <br/>
<br/>
If you're worried about damaging the earth, just do as Adrian<br/>
suggested.  Make the depth of the plug a little bit below the roots.<br/>
That will keep the grass alive.  Eventually, the grass will grow<br/>
back to the way it was.  I would think you could leave a little <br/>
tape or pendant marker behind also.  That may help, and it would<br/>
not necessarily indicate to an untrained observer that something<br/>
is hidden there.<br/>
<br/>
I keep remembering Thom's letterbox suspended<br/>
inside a tree from a wooden plug at the end of a length of<br/>
fish line.  I assume that wooden plug melds nicely with the bark<br/>
of the tree.  Now that's creative.<br/>
<br/>
Keep having fun everyone.  But certainly don't go digging a bunch<br/>
of holes looking for a letterbox.  I agree with Erik there.  Don't<br/>
be a "lettergopher".  But if I understand it correctly a plug you<br/>
should be able to remove WITHOUT a shovel.  I would not suggest<br/>
taking a shovel with you on a letterbox hunt.  Maybe a little<br/>
garden spade or a bowie knife wood suffice.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Dan<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The terrain of Door County, Wisconsin is mostly rock with a very thin<br/>
covering of soil.  If I were to dig out a plug deep enough to keep the<br/>
grass intact, I'd run into solid limestone.  On the plus side, this<br/>
limestone makes great caves both big and small (i.e. letterbox size!)<br/>

I guess I can be counted in the "pro-plugging" group.  As a card<br/>
carrying conservationist, I respect the earth &amp; expect others have the<br/>
same level of intelligence and respect.  I see no ill effects from<br/>
plugging in an otherwise featureless location.  Saying this, I have a<br/>
mental picture of a neatly trowelled hole, the lid of said hole adorned<br/>
with a Purple-speckled Rocky Mountain Loosestrife (insert your own<br/>
specific endangered plant species).  As in all things, common sense must<br/>
prevail.<br/>
<br/>
Curses&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I also think this is humorous &amp; might just deter a would-be vandal<br/>
through a well-timed chuckle.  Not being a witch, warlock or whatever<br/>
passes for one these days, I'm sure whatever curse I "conjure" up will<br/>
be as harmless as its intent.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my whole theme here is BE CREATIVE.  I really like the way they<br/>
do it in Dartmoor (letterboxing that is), but my next bunch of boxes are<br/>
going to be quirky and difficult by clue and location (be forewarned<br/>
Mitch).  No more walking right up and collecting a stamp!!!  If Daniel<br/>
visits his son for spring break, he's gonna have to get wet and dirty to<br/>
collect all the Portland boxes this year!!<br/>
