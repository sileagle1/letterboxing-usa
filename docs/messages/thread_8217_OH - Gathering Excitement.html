DocMan for getting it all organized and putting out special boxes <br/>
just for us!  It was especially nice to meet franzsolo face to face.  <br/>
It has been almost exactly one year since I joined his solo resident <br/>
letterboxing act in Ohio.   <br/>
<br/>
It got me fired up to do some more boxing, now that the weather is <br/>
cooling off a bit.  <br/>
<br/>
I did put two letterboxes back out that had been removed a month or <br/>
so ago.  Each have new clues.<br/>
<br/>
For fun, here is the clue poem from the new Lost Fishie Mysterie:<br/>
*********************************************8<br/>
Oh where, Oh where could that little fish be?<br/>
Oh where, Oh where could he be?<br/>
<br/>
All you have is a little fragment of a map:<br/>
And a few notes:<br/>
<br/>
Near the pylon on the east side,<br/>
Standing under an absent bridge,<br/>
Trees overhead and still,<br/>
You can't hide!<br/>
<br/>
Face the noontime sun, <br/>
Turn away from the path,<br/>
Carrying kids that peddle for fun,<br/>
Forward 32 paces.<br/>
<br/>
Pass the Orc road at 20,<br/>
Keep going,<br/>
To a sycamore tree,<br/>
 On the righting.<br/>
<br/>
Find the Pisces!<br/>
Five pacies West<br/>
Look for a cocoon<br/>
Flyfisher high.<br/>
<br/>
Tuck 'em back to sleep,<br/>
For the next boxing fisher,<br/>
Or fishing boxer,<br/>
Pisces!<br/>
<br/>
******************************************<br/>
The clues for this box (with map fragment) are posted here:<br/>
http://www.qsl.net/ws8g/lostfishie.htm<br/>
<br/>
And the second box returned to the wilds is posted here:<br/>
http://www.qsl.net/ws8g/nothingbutfootprints.htm<br/>
<br/>
I have updated my index at:<br/>
http://www.qsl.net/ws8g/flyfisherindex.htm<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate if if our Ohio web mistress could remove <br/>
the "temporarially not available" tags on Lost Fishie and Nothing but <br/>
Footprints.<br/>
