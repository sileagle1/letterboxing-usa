specifically!  The One for the History Books Event is coming along <br/>
fabulously!  The letterboxing community has been so wonderful helping <br/>
me to prepare for this event.  Boxers that I have never met have come <br/>
out of the woodwork (or is that the woods?) to carve, to offer insight <br/>
and to help with planning. Thanks a bunch to all of you! <br/>
<br/>
I only have one "problem" now.....we need more boxers to attend!  I <br/>
have listed some hotels/cabins in the Skowhegan (ME) area for lodging <br/>
on the AQ website.  If you are interested in splitting a room, let me <br/>
know, I can contact some of the other people staying in the area that <br/>
weekend and see if we can set something up.  I am very sure that anyone <br/>
who chooses to spend at least one night in the area will not be <br/>
disappointed by the number of boxes here to find.  We'll keep you <br/>
plenty busy for a couple days!  <br/>
<br/>
And, on top of accomodations and loads of boxes....I'm guaranteeing <br/>
perfect boxing weather and lots of fun!  It doesn't get any better than <br/>
that!  Take a few minutes to check out the One for the History Books <br/>
Event listed on AQ.  I promise you, you won't regret the trip!<br/>
