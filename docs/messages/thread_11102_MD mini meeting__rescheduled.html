<br/>
**NOTED THIS WAS TO HAPPEN IN FEB, HOWEVER DUE TO A *LITTLE* SNOW IT WAS RESCHEDULED...SEE BELOW FOR NEW DATE**<br/>
<br/>
I know that this is a short supsense, however I would like to invite one and all (from not just MD, but all 50 of our fine United States)to join me at the gathering mentioned below. <br/>
<br/>
I am meeting with a reporter from the Annapolis Capital paper <br/>
(http://www.capitalonline.com/) <br/>
<br/>
We will be meeting at 10:00am on Sunday March 16th, 2003 at a<br/>
place in Crofton Maryland called JAPSERS. <br/>
<br/>
Jaspers <br/>
1651 State Route 3 N <br/>
Crofton, MD  21114 <br/>
301.261.3505 <br/>
<br/>
We will meet at the entrance of the restaurant. The reporter is <br/>
doing a story on local letterboxing and local letterboxes. The<br/>
reporter asked to let other Maryland letterboxes know about the<br/>
event; to be able to talk to a variety of people. <br/>
