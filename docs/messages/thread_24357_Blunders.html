     Should I dare to mention that others are not<br/>

    Occasionally a blunder may occur in even the most<br/>
refined of characters. This is attested to by the<br/>
answers of your so-called suspects.  You, sir, seem to<br/>
make a career of blunders. <br/>
<br/>
    Lame excuses are not socially acceptable methods<br/>
of apology; after all, apology is nothing more than a<br/>
word. Neither is submitting a bill of your damages to<br/>
an innocent party socially acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
    Viciousness and groundless accusations are not<br/>
proper procedures for handling an investigation. <br/>
<br/>
     Every interaction with our fellow beings requires<br/>
etiquette. Does it not occur to you that many doors<br/>
will open with a polite word, or do you enjoy being<br/>

You have a choice to read, delete, change to "no email, or unsub. <br/>
What you think of as spam others may be able to view another way, or <br/>
rather other "ways".<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is very much like an onion, start peeling away and you <br/>
get to many other levels. There are many ways to play the game, so if <br/>
you dislike this way then don't bother to play or comment.<br/>
No one is forcing you to read anything, but then again it might do <br/>
you some good, and maybe if you tried to figure things out you might <br/>
just 'get it'. I believe there have been sufficient notices given <br/>
that these posts aren't necessarily what they seem...or maybe they <br/>
are.<br/>

I took this from fishman to mean that fishman knows exactly what's going on.<br/>
I didn't get the idea that fishman was cluesless.<br/>

<br/>
On the other hand, for those who aren't interested at all in reading this<br/>
story (like me), it might not be a rude idea to consider sticking to 2 or 3<br/>
subject lines rather than changing the subject so that it's easier to<br/>
recognize what one (like me) wants to delete without opening.  But I know<br/>
that to suggest that would merely instantly result in the beginning of a<br/>
dozen more subject lines.<br/>

Now this reminds me of a story about a Foo Bird. If the discharge of <br/>
a Foo bird gets dropped on anyones skin it would create horible pain <br/>
if mixed with water when it is washed off. Thus the saying "If a Foo  <br/>
sh*ts...wear it.<br/>

Plus the onion so aptly fits.<br/>
