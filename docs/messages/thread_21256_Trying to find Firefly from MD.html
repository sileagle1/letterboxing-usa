Does anyone know a boxer named Firefly from MD? I have been trying to<br/>
contact her through e-mail repeatedly and am not getting any reply. I<br/>
already posted to this and the other lists about a month ago asking<br/>
her to contact me but got no response. I even tried sending a postcard<br/>
in the mail. I see she is still a member here, but not at the LBNE or<br/>
PostalLetterboxing groups so I'm trying here one more time. <br/>
If anyone has any idea how to get in touch with her I would really<br/>
appreciate some info. According to delivery confirmation, my Sam the<br/>
Camera Man PLB arrived there in the beginning of November and has<br/>
still not gotten to the next person and I have not been able to get in<br/>
touch with her. This PLB has photos from around the country pasted<br/>
into the logbook as well as a disposable camera with many more<br/>
undeveloped photos and I would really like to get it back. Thanks!<br/>
