For those doing ShrinkyDinks for gimmies - one of my monster boxes <br/>
has some for which I carved a big stamp to stamp the plastic - I used <br/>
pigment cause it said it was good for shrink plastic -- and it was <br/>
but I had to leave the sheets to dry overnite before baking!!! <br/>
(please excuse my smears when you get to Mansfield).  Then I colored <br/>
in some portions with color pens for rubberstamping.  The orange <br/>
stuck to the parchment so I don't think it liked the heat from the <br/>
oven, or maybe it wasn't dry?  Fortunately only very small portions <br/>
with the pen ink so they still looked fine.  Had I taken more time I <br/>
would have acrylic painted the small portions.<br/>
Enough about me, back to the posts . . . .and are the hot topics <br/>
called PostToasties when the flame dies down?<br/>

It dries way too fast.  <br/>
