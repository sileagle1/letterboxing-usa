I was sorry to miss the Fall Gather, Floating Feather and I had started to <br/>
make plans to come but then I found out that my 11 yr old son had a football <br/>
game that day...had to be there.<br/>
Glad to hear everyone had a great time!<br/>
In response to Aili's comment on postcards, I try to put pre-addressed, <br/>
stamped post cards in my boxes when I first plant them. To my delight I have <br/>
recieved several back, the latest from a father and son team who were <br/>
visiting family in easteren PA., all the way from Tualatin, Oregon !! They <br/>
stamped their stamp on the card and I got to see/meet folks I never would <br/>
have.<br/>
Always a pleasure!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy Life!  See Joy<br/>
