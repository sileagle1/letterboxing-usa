We toured Beebe Pond and the Celestial Motion series. All boxes were <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Exactly! Beebe Pond is on Route 215 in Groton, between the boroughs <br/>
of Groton Long Point and Mystic. A nice (rocky!) hike.  You  will <br/>
find the clues under "Celestial Motion" in Groton. I'd reserve about <br/>
3-4 hours and do Haley Farm, Beebe Pond and then drive to Bluff <br/>
Point for the box there.   You can walk from Haley to Bluff bu its <br/>
an extra 2 1/4 miles or so round trip, so plan accordingly!<br/>
<br/>
GREAT views at Haley Farm SP this time of year.  It has not leafed <br/>
out so its warm out but still can see the water from Canopy Rock and <br/>
the Picnic Spot LB.<br/>
