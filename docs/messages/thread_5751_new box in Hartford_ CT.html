rose garden in the country.   Planted June 14, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Distance -  no clue, maybe  mile<br/>
Time  maybe 20 minutes, more if you are stopping to smell the roses.<br/>
OK, that was lame.<br/>
Difficulty - Easy, I think<br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth Park is located at the corner  of  Prospect Avenue and <br/>
Asylum<br/>
Avenue on the Hartford / West Hartford line.  Take exit 44 (Prospect<br/>
Avenue) off I- 84 and head North on Prospect Avenue. The entrance<br/>
to the gardens is about 3/4 of a mile on your left.  If you hit Asylum<br/>
Avenue, turn left at that light and another entrance will be obvious <br/>
on<br/>
your left.  Park near the Pond House Restaurant (or as close as you <br/>
can)<br/>
<br/>
because this is where your search begins.<br/>
<br/>
An historical note before we begin.<br/>
The area which is now known as Elizabeth Park was once owned by <br/>
Charles<br/>
H. Pond.  Mr. Pond was a wealthy industrialist and statesman whose<br/>
career included the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, Hartford<br/>
National Bank, and Treasurer of the State of Connecticut.  When Mr. <br/>
Pond<br/>
<br/>
passed away, he willed his estate to the City of Hartford with the<br/>
stipulations that it be used as a horticultural park and that it be<br/>
named for his wife, Elizabeth, who had died a few years earlier.  In <br/>
Mr.<br/>
<br/>
Pond's time, the Hartford/West Hartford border was located about a<br/>
quarter mile west of where it is today.  When the boundary was moved <br/>
to<br/>
its present location, it resulted in the unusual situation of one of<br/>
Hartford's larger parks being situated mostly within the Town of West<br/>
Hartford.   Some 15,000 bushes are the center piece of Elizabeth Park<br/>
and is known throughout the world.  Today the park encompasses 102 <br/>
acres<br/>
<br/>
and boasts many garden areas, pathways, greenhouses, lawns, a picnic<br/>
grove, a pond and recreation areas.  For more info before you head <br/>
out,<br/>

<br/>
On to the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Find the pond house.  From the southwest side, follow either asphalt<br/>
path past the "Sedna" sculpture.  From one side I thought it looked a<br/>
bit like a dolphin kissing it's own tail, but the other side yielded a<br/>
surprise.  Apologies to the artist for the dolphin comment.<br/>
<br/>
Stay on the path and cross the pretty stone bridge.<br/>
<br/>
After the bridge you will find a small grouping of benches on the <br/>
left.<br/>
Take the asphalt path to the right over the more rugged rock bridge.<br/>
This will be your first opportunity to turn right on asphalt.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on until you reach the clearing.  Go to the arborish gazebo.<br/>
Don't worry, you'll see it no matter what season you visit the park.  <br/>
Go<br/>
<br/>
to the middle.  For those etymologists out there, I made up the word<br/>
arborish.<br/>
<br/>
With your back to the center pole head off at 110 degrees for 44 <br/>
paces.<br/>
For me a pace is made up of two steps, one with each foot.<br/>
<br/>
When you reach the red path, stop there for a change of direction.  <br/>
Head<br/>
<br/>
20 paces at 70 degrees to the thin red tree.<br/>
<br/>
Please be careful here.  This last step needs to be executed carefully<br/>
so as to not trample vegetation.  Go 4 paces at 180 degrees to a <br/>
really<br/>
tall tree.  Be careful, as there is a little bit of Poison ivy on the<br/>
front.  Your prize is tucked away at the back.<br/>
<br/>
This is a terrific park, so enjoy some of the other gardens before you<br/>
head out.<br/>
<br/>
