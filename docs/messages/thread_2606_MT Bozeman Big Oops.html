I found the Grotto Falls box earlier today, and realized down the road I had <br/>
dropped the letterbox stamp into my bag instead of back into the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I am new at this, and have decided to keep the stamp with me (I couldn't go <br/>
back) and ask Der Mad Stamper or Mark (no last name) of Bozeman, who was the <br/>
last person to stamp the log (Sept. 2000) to tell me who I can mail the <br/>
stamp to, to get it back to its hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
I considered leaving it at the USFS Ranger Station and at the Visitor <br/>
Center, but thought I'd best not, not knowing what, if any, relationship or <br/>
feeling those organizations have about letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I also considered asking the next hiker to take it up for me, but again, <br/>
just don't know if that would have been the right thing.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't go back myself for several reasons; so sorry!!<br/>
<br/>
I hope I am doing the right thing.  I'll be online for another half-hour or <br/>
so, so if somebody SOON can tell me where in Bozeman I might deliver this <br/>
stamp, I'll deliver it.  Otherwise, please let me know who I can mail it to.<br/>
