change MY letterboxing experience.<br/>
<br/>
First finders?  Bring 'em on.  There's a certain pride to be had in <br/>
being the first to log into a box that no one else has found, <br/>

<br/>&lt;&lt;I thought these boards were for Letterboxing.  Benchmarks and Geo-
<br/>caching should be discussed on that website.  Since many letterboxers 
<br/>do NOT geo-cache, count your benchmarks at the appropriate web site.&gt;&gt;
<br/>
<br/>I find the discussions about other similar types of hobbies interesting. I don't think I'm going to do the geocaching thing, but the benchmark thing sounds like fun. A lot of trails that boxes are on go over places where the benchmarks already are. It kind of sounds like Monroe Bagging, which they do in Scotland. 
<br/>
<br/>&lt;&lt;While I'm on the subject of counting... Who cares how many boxes 
<br/>anyone has found or not? &gt;&gt;
<br/>
<br/>I do. It's an interesting part of the hobby. Has nothing to do with competition, in my mind. More like when birdwatchers ask them how many they've got on their logs.
<br/>
<br/> &lt;&lt;Does it really change the fun that you're having while you're out hunting for the letterbox? &gt;&gt;
<br/>
<br/>Nope. I don't think about what other people have done while we're out on the trail. Too busy looking for landmarks. :-)
<br/>
<br/>&lt;&lt; The only one that gets cheated is the one who mis-represents themselves.  I couldn't care less if someone has found 50 or 2000 boxes because it doesn't 
<br/>change MY letterboxing experience.&gt;&gt;
<br/>
<br/>Is this a common problem?
<br/>
<br/>&lt;&lt;First finders?  Bring 'em on.  There's a certain pride to be had in 
<br/>being the first to log into a box that no one else has found, 
<br/>especially if it's a mystery box.  Enjoy your find, brag about it 
<br/>(not too much though) and then go about the business of letterboxing 
<br/>again.&gt;&gt;
<br/>
<br/>It's just as much fun to be first as it is to be near the end of the log. When you're first, you stamp in knowing that everyone that comes after you will see your stamp, which is cool for us newbies, who are used to seeing everyone else's stamps, because then we know that other stampers in the area will get a chance to see our stamps. When you're near the end, you get to see everyone else that's been before you, HHs that have been there, the notes and things people leave behind, etc. It's cool either way.
