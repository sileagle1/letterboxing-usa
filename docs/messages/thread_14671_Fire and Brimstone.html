Many have offered the advice of ignoring letterboxes that you find <br/>
offensive.  I would do just that, however, since this one is a <br/>

anything goes?  What else is lurking out there?  Are there <br/>
letterboxes (especially hitchhikers) with any of the following:  <br/>
pornographic stamps, racist themes, profanity, or glorifying the <br/>
events of 9/11?  Would you suggest the same remedy, or take your own <br/>
advice if you found one?  Just ignore it and pass it along?  Somehow <br/>
I don't think so.  The fact that this particular theme is not <br/>
offensive to you makes your suggestion  simply insensitive.  Don't <br/>
dismiss my view because it is a minority one.  I was fairly certain <br/>
that the creator of this box was unaware that a certain part of the <br/>

politely, and suggested a remedy.  The vitriol and hostility shown <br/>
toward me because I dared to voice my Christian view is <br/>
flabbergasting.<br/>
<br/>
It is clear to me that Letterboxing is no place for a Christian.  I <br/>

As a confirmed practicing Roman Catholic who is very involved in her parish, I resent the comments that you chose to make. I feel that you should remember that for every situation, there are people on both sides. I take particular personal offense to the following piece of your most recent email:<br/>
"It is clear to me that Letterboxing is no place for a Christian.  I must take back what I said earlier, this is NOT a nice community.  It was not one or two who rose up to attack me, but an hateful, sanctimonious mob."<br/>
<br/>
Sir, letterboxing is an excellent Christian activity. It promotes an exploration of the beauty of God's creation in nature and presents the opportunity for building a deeper relationship within oneself with the gifts that He has granted to us.<br/>
<br/>
This is, in fact, a very nice community. Perhaps your intention was not initially to denounce the beliefs of a fellow letterboxer, but that is how your first email, written in criticism of the "Witchcraft Letterbox" was perceived. Out of the 1200 members of the list, I would not consider less than 25 responses (and less than 25 distinct responders) to be a "sanctimonious mob". Far less appropriate than the usage of the term "mob" is your choice of the word "sanctimonious", as your choice of that word is hypocrisy itself.<br/>
<br/>
Reverend, I respect your views as a fellow Christian and human being. I take issue with your denouncement of letterboxing itself as an act unworthy of Christian participation. Sir, when I was letterboxing last week, I prayed with joy at the glory of the nature around me. It had been some time since I had been able to hike and be alone with my thoughts, and I was inspired to thank Him for all that He created.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that you will reconsider your stance on letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; It is clear to me that Letterboxing is no place for a Christian.  I<br/>
&gt; must take back what I said earlier, this is NOT a nice community.  It<br/>
&gt; was not one or two who rose up to attack me, but an hateful,<br/>
&gt; sanctimonious mob.  I will be writing a letter to the editor of<br/>
&gt; Family Fun Magazine about my experience, as a warning to others who<br/>
&gt; would come here in a spirit of friendliness.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I really was hoping to just let this die, but I HAVE to respond <br/>
to this.<br/>
<br/>
I am a Christian.  In fact, my husband is a Seventh-day Adventist <br/>
minister.  We have found letterboxing to be a wonderful, WHOLESOME, <br/>
uplifting activity because it gets us out in nature and allows us to <br/>
spend time together.<br/>
<br/>
As you may know, Seventh-day Adventists refrain from secular activities <br/>
for a 24-hour period from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday to honor <br/>
the Sabbath.  We have chosen letterboxing as an appropriate Sabbath <br/>
activity because it brings us closer to God and to each other.<br/>
<br/>
I am very sorry that anyone would feel that letterboxing is <br/>
inappropriate for a Christian because a few stamps have been planted <br/>
that they do not agree with.  In fact, there are a number of overtly <br/>
Christian stamps as well, which could even be offensive to others IF <br/>
THEY CHOSE TO BE OFFENDED.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to apologize to the letterboxing community at large for <br/>
this mis-representation of Christianity, and let you know that I would <br/>
be delighted to go letterboxing with any of you, no matter what your <br/>
religious, sexual, or other persuasions.  I have found the letterboxing <br/>
community to be extremely friendly and helpful as my husband and I have <br/>
gotten started, and up to this point everyone on the list has gotten <br/>
along wonderfully.<br/>
<br/>
To the Reverend:  What would Jesus do?  Would He seclude himself in a <br/>
small community of like-minded people who would be sure not to offend <br/>
Him?  Would He lash out at people whose lifestyles don't match His <br/>
perfect standard?  As far as I can recall, the only people Jesus <br/>
rebuked openly were demons and Pharisees (the conservative religious <br/>
elite).<br/>
<br/>
Matthew 9:9-11: As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew <br/>
sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and <br/>
Matthew got up and followed him. While Jesus was having dinner at <br/>
Matthew's house, many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with <br/>
him and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his <br/>
disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and <br/>
'sinners'?"<br/>
<br/>
And now I REALLY hope this topic will die.  If ANYONE feels the need to <br/>

1 Timothy 1:14-16<br/>
The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the <br/>
faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.  Here is a trustworthy saying <br/>
that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save <br/>
sinners--of whom I am the worst.  But for that very reason I was shown <br/>
mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display <br/>
his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him <br/>
and receive eternal life.<br/>

&gt;1 Timothy 1:14-16<br/>
&gt;The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the<br/>
&gt;faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.  Here is a trustworthy saying<br/>
&gt;that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save<br/>
&gt;sinners--of whom I am the worst.  But for that very reason I was shown<br/>
&gt;mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display<br/>
&gt;his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him<br/>
&gt;and receive eternal life.<br/>

&gt; I was floored when I turned my computer on earlier this evening.  <br/>
It <br/>
&gt; has taken me a while to digest all the vitriol that my post on the <br/>
&gt; Witchcraft hitchhiker generated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dude, what did you expect when you used such weighted words <br/>
as "glorifying the occult" and when you compared the stamp to <br/>
Satanism?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Many have offered the advice of ignoring letterboxes that you find <br/>
&gt; offensive.  I would do just that, however, since this one is a <br/>
&gt; traveling hitchhiker, it is thrust upon you.  Is letterboxing <br/>
&gt; anything goes?  What else is lurking out there?  Are there <br/>
&gt; letterboxes (especially hitchhikers) with any of the following:  <br/>
&gt; pornographic stamps, racist themes, profanity, or glorifying the <br/>
&gt; events of 9/11?  Would you suggest the same remedy, or take your <br/>
own <br/>
&gt; advice if you found one?  Just ignore it and pass it along?  <br/>
Somehow <br/>
&gt; I don't think so.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then you'd continue to be wrong. Would I be taken aback and upset? <br/>
Yes. Would I stamp it into my book? No. Would I leave it where it <br/>
is? Definitely yes. Would I post to this board about my discovery? <br/>
Probably not. Someone who holds views opposite to mine and chooses <br/>
to carve a stamp about it may do so, just as I may refuse to move <br/>
along that HH and take an impression of it for my logbook. If it <br/>
were a permanent box, I would take the same steps.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will be writing a letter to the editor of <br/>
&gt; Family Fun Magazine about my experience, as a warning to others <br/>
who <br/>
&gt; would come here in a spirit of friendliness.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You do that, but I encourage you to print copies of ALL of <br/>
this "vitriol," as you call it, and send that along with your letter <br/>
so that the magazine's editor can get the entire picture and form an <br/>
opinion based on all sides and not just yours. But you strike me as <br/>
the type that would never do this.<br/>
<br/>
Your previous posts ended with specious quotes. Well, I'm going to <br/>
end with a saying, too, taken from Wiccans, which I'm sure will <br/>
horrify you even more:<br/>
<br/>
DO NO HARM!<br/>

I am a Christian and have read the postings here for over a year, though <br/>
there are few for us to find here in Tennessee.  I am offended that you <br/>
would feel that this site is not welcoming to all.  Is it not written:  <br/>
Don't forget to be kind to strangers. For some who have done this have <br/>
entertained angels without realizing it.<br/>
--Hebrews 13:2<br/>
I feel that this list is an example of people doing just that.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that I am quite familiar with your history.  My husband is also a <br/>
minister here in TN and recalls you from your guest lecture at the Tennessee <br/>
Area Religious Teacher's conference in Knoxsville two years ago.  According <br/>
to him your behavior with some of those women was reprehensible.  You would <br/>
do weel to heed the words of the Lord "Let he who is without sin cast the <br/>
first stone."<br/>
<br/>

Sarah Surmonetti<br/>

It is clear to me that Letterboxing is no place for a Christian. I<br/>
must take back what I said earlier, this is NOT a nice community. It<br/>
was not one or two who rose up to attack me, but an hateful,<br/>
sanctimonious mob. I will be writing a letter to the editor of<br/>
Family Fun Magazine about my experience, as a warning to others who<br/>

To the mob I say this: Your advice about ignoring what offends you<br/>
