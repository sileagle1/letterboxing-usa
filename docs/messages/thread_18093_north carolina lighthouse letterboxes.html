                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't know if anyone else has reponded to you, but the reason why these letterboxes were pulled is obvious.  Bodie, Hatteras, and Ocracoke lighthouses are all part of a national park...Cape Hatteras National Seashore.  <br/>
<br/>
Be aware that National Parks are not just the fifty or so parks called "national parks" but over 400 locations in the National Park Service variously called National Park, Monument, Memorial, Military park, Seashore, Lakeshore, Historic Site, Battlefield, Recreation Area, and more.  Also be aware that National Wildlife Refuges are administered by the Department of the Interior and are subject to the same rules.  Do not plant letterboxes in National Wildlife Refuges!<br/>
<br/>
Specific to your question, I have just come back from the outter banks having placed boxes at Currituck, Oak Island, and Bald Head Island lighthouses myself. These are not part of national parks.  Clues will be posted within 2 days.  <br/>
