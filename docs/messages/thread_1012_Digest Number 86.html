Hi Elizabeth,<br/>
<br/>
We're very new to letterboxing as well.  Me and my 13 year old daughter went <br/>
on our first hunt this morning.  We found Letterbox #2 at York River State <br/>
Park, but I'm sorry to say Letterbox #1 is definitely gone.  <br/>
<br/>
I share your opinion about enjoying the combination of hiking in the woods <br/>
and hunting for the boxes.  When I first mentioned letterboxing to my two <br/>
teenage girls, they gave me that "another one of Mom's crazy ideas" looks.  <br/>
But after this morning, my 13 year old is hooked.   I mentioned the rest stop <br/>
idea to my daughter on the drive home this morning and she thought it sounded <br/>
like a cool way to break up a long drive.  Sounds like another reason for the <br/>
kids to say "are we there yet".  <br/>
<br/>
We'll be in RI for vacation in August and are already mapping out the boxes <br/>
we'll be able to hunt.  Where in RI have you been?<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>
