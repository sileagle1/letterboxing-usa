I found a letterbox today that had some self addressed, WITH STAMPS, <br/>
post cards, for the finder to take.  It had a spot designated for <br/>
your stamp on the card, and a section to report the condition of the <br/>
box, where you were from, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone else had ever run across this, or did it yourselves?<br/>

There are those among us who caution about divulging name, home<br/>
address, etc. in a public place. Hence, maybe self addressed cards are<br/>
not such a good idea.<br/>

Found it exactly once.  Took one of the post cards, stamped it, and <br/>
posted it, with a note that there were only two more left in the box. <br/>
 Later I regretted doing that, because I also e-mailed the placer.  <br/>
Seems to me it should be either/or, not both, just a waste of a post <br/>
card and postage.  They should probably be left for finders that <br/>
don't log their finds or contact placers via e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
Dunno for sure, though.  Perhaps the placer collects post cards with <br/>
sig stamps on them and wants all they can get!<br/>
