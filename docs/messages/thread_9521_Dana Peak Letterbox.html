Dana Peak Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Dana Peak is located in Harker Heights, TX. To get to the start point <br/>
from I-35, take US 190 West and exit FM 2410 East.  Continue East for <br/>
3.5 miles and turn right onto Commanche Gap (Follow the sign to "Dana <br/>
Peak").  Continue 2.5 miles, while you pass the "Goats for Sale," and <br/>
park at the bend in the road with the gate leading to a large path. <br/>
This is the start point.<br/>
<br/>
Pass the gate and walk up the hill on the large path until you come <br/>
to a large washout on the right. Follow the path at 130 degrees.  <br/>
Once the path narrows down, see the path up the hill to the right? <br/>
Don't take it, but start counting. Take 30 paces straight. Stop, turn <br/>
to 30 degrees and walk 5 paces to a clump of fallen trees. Look <br/>
inside the trees to find the Dana Peak Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Stamp away!  Due to the large amount of beer bottles atop the actual <br/>
peak, I didn't place the box there, but if you follow the path up the <br/>
hill, you'll see the small trail to the top, where there is a great <br/>
view of Stillhouse Hollow Lake. Enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know how the box is, as this is my first placement.<br/>
