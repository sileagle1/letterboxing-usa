Mass. and what better way to work on your compass skills for rank <br/>
advancement then letterboxing. During our trek (More like crawling) <br/>
through the many boulder caves in the chasm we worked on the Proposal <br/>
Letterbox Series.  We found the Two Hearts and Feelings letterboxes <br/>
intact but wet. We dried them out the best that we could.  We also <br/>
found the Intimacy Stamp in its bag lying in the woods near the clue <br/>
location, but no box or journal. I left the stamp in with the Two <br/>
Hearts letterbox for safekeeping.   I haven't found a way to send <br/>
this information to the placer so if anyone can contact them please <br/>
let them know about the condition of their boxes.  As for the scouts, <br/>
I think I've created some monsters.  At least five families are now <br/>
addicted to letterboxing.<br/>
