                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I make knives for a hobby, too, as well as several other <br/>
hobbies, and in knife making you can use wood for the handles.  The <br/>
(or so it seems right now) best kind of wood to use is wood that has <br/>
been stabilized,,, impregnated with resins under pressure and heat,,, <br/>
they don't tend to warp at all, are impervious to water, no cracking, <br/>
etc... When one has wood to be stabilized for knife handles, you can <br/>
get your wood oversized from what you need for the handle, and use <br/>
the "scraps" for your stamps, without fear of warpage.  One could get <br/>
some inexpensive wood, and send it off to be stabilized, and use it <br/>
all for stamp backing.  Of course, you can also order stabilized wood <br/>
from knife making supplies (more expensive, because they are usually <br/>
exotic type woods).  Buying exotic woods, and having them stabilized <br/>
is cheaper than buying the same exotic wood stabilized.  Just a <br/>
thought for those who might like the wood look.<br/>

I've been using the foam stuff that stampeaz sells.  It seems to work <br/>
pretty good, gives enough flexibility to get good images, but adds <br/>
support to the rubber, too.  I've been gluing them with my <br/>
bookbinding glue.  Not sure if that's the best option, but it's worked so far!<br/>

I like to back my 'PZ cut' carved stamps with wood or maybe masonite, and sometimes I sandwich a piece of foam in between. A product called, "Perfect Glue #1 by Liquid Nails" has been highly recommended as pretty durable through the seasons.I would like some opinions and feedback on using glues please. My stamps are in the 2" X 3" category. <br/>

I have been using thin plexiglass myself since DH has a huge piece of it  in <br/>
his workshop that had cracked and now he can't use it.  It is less than  1/8" <br/>
thick (maybe just over 1/16" ?) so adds very little weight and thickness  but <br/>
does give a nice firm backing.  The glue I have been using is called  "9001 <br/>
High Strength Adhesive" the label says "Bonds to Terracotta, Ceramic,  Plastic, <br/>
Metal &amp; Glass - Waterproof" so far it is doing great but then my  stamps that <br/>
have the backing haven't been out in the field that long or used  many times <br/>
yet, so really not sure how it will stand the test of time. I write  in ink pen <br/>
on the back of the stamp including an arrow to show which way is up  and the <br/>
name of the stamp then it shows thru the glue and backing when I am  finished. <br/>
I have used it with PZ-Kut, Master Carve, Speedy Cut and Speedy Stamp  (got <br/>
the sampler pack from Stampeaz to try to find a favorite).<br/>
Also when I prep the plexiglass for mounting my stamps I use the band saw  to <br/>
cut it to slightly bigger than my stamp then turn an orbital sander over and  <br/>
press the edges against it until they are nice and smooth, rounded with no <br/>
sharp  edges anywhere then I sand one flat side a bit to rough it up so the glue <br/>
sticks  better.  Hope that makes sense.<br/>

I've backed stamps using plexiglass (ace hardware scrap bin) and  rubber<br/>
cement.  Seems to work fine with Mastercarve.  I haven't  added any foam to<br/>
my stamps.<br/>
Where can I find scrap  masonite?<br/>
