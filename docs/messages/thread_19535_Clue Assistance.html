<br/>
Once again I'm in need of assistance. (Kind of a needy day today isn't it?)<br/>
I am part of the committee hosting the fabulous Passport to Letterboxing<br/>
campout (August 27-29, Battleground, WA). What we are in need of is people<br/>
from the East Coast that would be willing to let us use their unique clues<br/>
to show people different types of clues. We don't want to use anything that<br/>
is from this area so we don't spoil any puzzles the attendees might come<br/>
across, but would like to have some examples.<br/>
<br/>
So the bottom line is this.. if you are from the East Coast and would be<br/>
willing to let us use one of your clues that you think would be information<br/>
or fun, please email me off line!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much,<br/>
Maiden<br/>
