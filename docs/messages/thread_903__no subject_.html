Highlands Nature Center in Highlands, NC.  I have recently been working<br/>
with a student, Katy Betz, at the Highlands School on a Letterbox for<br/>
the town of Highlands.  We would like to enter our clues to make them<br/>
available for the public.  We also have some maps to scan in for our<br/>
site.  I am relatively unfamiliar with setting up a web site so I was<br/>
hoping y'all would be able to do it for us!  Katy will be entering the<br/>
clues at a later date and will also be scanning the maps.  Is there a<br/>
particular format you need these documents in?  My e-mail is<br/>
jenralph@yahoo.com and phone # is (828)526-2623<br/>

Your clues look great; I wish I was closer to you!<br/>
<br/>
The person responsible for posting clues in your part of the country <br/>
has been busy as a student for most of this year and there is quite a <br/>
backlog of clues waiting to be posted. We hope you will not have to <br/>
wait long.<br/>

OMG, i think going to the topiary gardens when it is getting dark, with<br/>
a thunderstorm approaching,  would be deliciously chilling and scary - a<br/>
definite thrill. (shades of  "the shining").  i am going to have to keep<br/>
my eye on the weather and try to make it up there when the conditions<br/>
are right!!<br/>

I tried to email this to the address link in the FAQ's that you wanted the<br/>
clues sent to you as well as posting them. However it came back as<br/>
undeliverable unable to contact. So I am sendin it to this link. Hopefully I<br/>
got the right one. Or even the right person.<br/>
<br/>
I first found out about this letterboxing, from an article in a magazine in a<br/>
US Airways aircraft during a flight. I went to the website mentioned in it  and<br/>
became hooked. Here is my first attempt. I am working on my second box already,<br/>
Unfortunatly I haven't been able to start seaching but hopefully will soon.<br/>

 I took "Fitzpatrick" and her son Thomas, (8 yrs old) on their 1st LB hunt, <br/>
they are "hooked"!  We went to MDC Reservoir, in West Hartford and what a <br/>
beautiful place, and I will be putting this on my list  of "Places to visit again <br/>
in the fall."  I can kick myself for not having my cam with me when <br/>
"Fitzpatrick" found her 1st box, what a joy and again when we were looking for "French <br/>
Huguenot" and Thomas down on his hands &amp; knees looking in one end of the hollow <br/>

i am still fairly new to letterboxing (3 months), but i have now placed 4 boxes. i find that it is easy for me to make a stamp, or buy one, then find a place to put it. you should take notes/directions as you travel to your eventual destintation. after placing your box, when you get home and add it to the list on letterboxing.org, you deside how you want to phrase your clues/directions. as far as introducing it to others, i found it best to gather the items you need to go searching and/or gather the items you will find while searching. i did this with my dad and he found the hobby pretty need. feel free to use my letterboxes or someone elses, to gain interest, or use as a training tool. My name is team new hampshire and i am located in NH. i hope i am of some help to you.....<br/>

I wish I had known about this when I was a troop<br/>
leader!! I'm fairly new to this (6weeks) but what<br/>
helped me most  was letterboxing north america and<br/>
altas quest and some of the links they suggest. all of<br/>
the clues can be found by area on lbna (letterboxing<br/>
north america), and you can ask for a print view and<br/>
print them off.  Make your stamp ahead of time so you<br/>
are good to go, take an ink pad, especially up north<br/>
where they freeze if left out, and get an acid free<br/>
notebook to stamp in.  a decent compass for a couple<br/>
of bucks at walmart or GSUSA or boy scouts, and go<br/>
it's that easy, oh yeas, a pen... acid free too, if<br/>
you have them.  (gel pens are great).  there are tips<br/>
at the sites and groups...like lbMA,  newboxeres,<br/>
lbna, atlasquest, other regional groups.... it's fun, <br/>
oh, on another note, what does the scout badge look<br/>
like, which rank is it for.  I still have my<br/>
sweatshrit with all my patches sewn on... egads....<br/>

signature?)<br/>

collar every time they think someone is telling them how to play the<br/>
game. This game is not owned by anyone, there are no rules. It's a<br/>
cultural phenomenon with a life of it's own. What does it matter if<br/>
someone "condemns" you for how you play the game, what power do they<br/>
have over you? Only as much as you grant them. As long as you're not<br/>
vandalizing someone else's work then do it however you please and stop<br/>
seeking validation or expecting adulation. I recall a weeklong<br/>
discussion on this list not so long ago about whether it was "OK" to<br/>
use 3x5 cards to stamp images in the field then put them in a book.<br/>
Who cares! If that's what you want to do, do it. Stamp them on your<br/>
ass if you want. Why do you need our permission?<br/>
