We all know how much sway large corporations have with state and <br/>
federal legislators...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Glad or Rubbermaid could affect the outcome...<br/>

Yes, I'm replying to myself, but...<br/>

Well, I'm actually serious. I found out today that Glad is owned by <br/>
the Clorox Company, which owns and markets hundreds of popular <br/>
products in categories across the board:<br/>
<br/>
 Laundry <br/>
 Household Cleaning <br/>
 Auto Care <br/>
 Charcoal <br/>
 Bags, Wraps and Containers <br/>
 Dressings and Sauces <br/>
 Cat Litter <br/>
 Water Filtration <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Some of these things HAVE to come from South Carolina. I'd be <br/>
surprised if there wasn't a single one. Why is this important? <br/>
Because the company is involved in the communities "in which its <br/>
employees live and work."<br/>
<br/>
http://www.thecloroxcompany.com/community/index.html<br/>
<br/>
If they're really concerned about their communities, then this law <br/>
could be perceived as detrimental to the overall quality of life in <br/>
those communities. I think the potential for the right persons to <br/>
persuade the right people to simply "look the other way" or "get out <br/>
an box" is certainly there. Is is probable? Umm... no. Possible? YES.<br/>
<br/>
Would this bring letterboxing to the attention of mainstream media? <br/>
Perhaps, but not if it was kept quiet and away from regional and <br/>
national media. I also think the politicians wouldn't want to be <br/>
seen as wasting their time on what is to the general public, for all <br/>
intents and purposes, a trivial matter that isn't worth the taxpayer <br/>
dollars and bureaucratic nonsense some ill-conceived laws generate. <br/>
But I could be wrong... there could be a firebrand in the chambers.<br/>
<br/>
Newell-Rubbermaid is another major consumer force. One of their <br/>
companies, Goody Hair Products, used to be in Peachtree City. This <br/>
is another one where I doubt that not a single one of the product <br/>
lines they own and/or market doesn't come from SC.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, enough for now...<br/>
