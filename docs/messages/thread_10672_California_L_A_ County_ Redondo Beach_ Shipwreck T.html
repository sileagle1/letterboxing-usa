<div>Shipwreck Trail, Palos Verde's Peninsula 
,California, by Don and Gwen,2-1-03</div>
<div> From Redondo Beach take Pacific Coast Hwy(1) to Palos Verde's Blvd. 
and head south. Palos Verde's Blvd turns into Palos Verde's Blvd West. Turn 
right on Via Corta then right on Via Arroyo.Turn left on Paseo Del Mar and 
park at Flat Rock Point near the locked chain gate. If you pass Via Horcada 
you have gone too far.Take the wide dirt path down toward the ocean  A 
short way down you will observe an empty metal frame for a sign on your right. 
Stop here and enjoy the view . This is a heavily traveled path on weekends so be 
discreet. # 1 box. Take 25 paces from the empty metal frame at 100 degrees up, 
then 5 paces up at 80 degrees. The micro box is at the base of the 
outcropping. If you are having a problem look to where the side trails form an 
upside down Y. The outcropping is above the point of the V in the Y.  
</div>
<div>#2 box. Continue down the trail following the curvature of the cove passing 
Cory's bench. You will find walking is easiest nearest the 
cliffside once you are at sea level. From the far end of the concrete out 
flow ( for ref. it is 7 paces between the sides) take 70 paces to a faint path 
up to a ledge on your left. Go up onto this ledge and you should see a crude 
wooden bench, then a path up to a second ledge that has several 1ft. 
x 1ft.beams and other pieces of lumber. From the path that goes up to the 
second ledge, take 23 paces along the path that is above sea level and 
continues along the coast and you will come to a small open area , then turn 
slightly left and go up hill for 25 paces through low bushes.The box is on the 
up hill side of the path behind a rock cairn. If you miss the cairn the path 
will dead end at the ledge edge in about 11 paces.  Box #2 should only 
be attempted at low tide (CHECK TIDE TABLES!). Hiking boots are best due to the 
uneven rocks and boulders along the seashore. This hike is not dog friendly nor 
is it the best for small children . Continuing past box #2 brings you to 
the site of the grounding and breakup of the Greek freighter "Dominator" . 
Pieces of the ship can still be found even after it's demise in 1961 at Palos 
Verde's 
Point .
