The Road to Enlightenment<br/>
by Plain and Peanut<br/>
<br/>
The musky aroma of aged pages flipped the lightswitch of schoolday <br/>
memories.  At first it was unpleasant, dragging unwilling prisoners of <br/>
recollection out of the darkness and into her sight.  She hadnt been in <br/>
a library for years.  Mandated reading lists conspired with <br/>
dispassionate lecturers to extinguish her curiosity.  Perhaps she would <br/>
never have stepped back into the soft, warm springs of knowledge if it <br/>
hadnt been for that spider on the citronella bush in the corner of her <br/>
herb garden.  How it had startled her, brazenly flaunting its angry <br/>
yellow and sinister black stripes down the length of its two full <br/>
inches!  She feared arachnids more than she feared nostalgia.  Before <br/>
one more scissorsnip brought the flowered gloves on her hands any closer <br/>
to the suspect beast residing next to the tarragon, she resolved to find <br/>
the location of the nearest spider identification guide.  She was <br/>
astonished to find no suitable option on the world wide web and resorted <br/>
to discovering the location of the nearest library.  As it happened, <br/>
Bull Run Regional Library was just two miles from home.<br/>
<br/>
     Cold uncertainty set in when it became clear to her that no card <br/>
catalog existed.  She would have to unscramble the blinking characters <br/>
on the alien computer screen to accomplish her task.  Cautiously and <br/>
full of self-doubt, she typed spiders, in the general keyword search <br/>
box.  Gentle affirmation smoothed out her ruffled confidence when <br/>
several hits appeared on the screen.  Now she knew where to start.<br/>
<br/>
     One index finger guided her eyes along the shelfs edge.  She <br/>
paused a moment.  That book doesnt seem to fit here, she thought. <br/>
But the dewey decimal numbers on the spine were correct, so she <br/>
shrugged, and moved on.<br/>
<br/>
     After an interesting study in spider abdomens and orb webs, she was <br/>
relieved to decode the fact that her shocking, many-legged monster was <br/>
in the Argiope family;  it was a Common Garden Spider.  She mentally <br/>
insisted that there was nothing common about her resident <br/>
tallgrass-and-sun-loving fanged phantasm, but the ubiquitous they were <br/>
not listening.  It was a Common Garden Spider.  It was a threat only to <br/>
serenity.<br/>
<br/>
     Feeling much-empowered by her new-found competence, she decided to <br/>
venture forth into the stream of consciousness once more.  Perhaps a <br/>
stroll up and down the aisles would make the next trip less <br/>
intimidating.  Yes, she would cozy up to this unsurpassable freedom of <br/>
information. . . get to know it a little better.<br/>
<br/>
     There are the computer books. . . certainly she could use those, <br/>
but on another adventure, perhaps.  Religions, The Lives of the Saints . <br/>
. . What is that next to The Lives of the Saints?  She grinned and <br/>
chuckled at the ill-planned neighborhood this created.  A book which, <br/>
despite accurate dewey decimal markings, was destined forever to be the <br/>
despicable neighbor-with-the-cars-up-on-blocks among righteous preachers <br/>
and their modest wives.  When her interest was sated, she moved along.<br/>
<br/>
     How much life she had wasted!  How many answers there were to be <br/>
found here!  Although she could never repossess the years she had failed <br/>
to enrich, a new plan coagulated in her mind.  No time like the <br/>
present! she declared.  Today she would walk away from the muddy, vague <br/>
bog  of careless acceptance.  Today she would fire up her corroded <br/>
cognitive connectors and learn something new.<br/>
<br/>
     Retaining enough of her long-decayed faculties to know that the <br/>
best place to start is always at the beginning, she strained to remember <br/>
as far back as possible to the first time she wondered but did not seek <br/>
to quench her thirst.  Out of the swirling beige past emerged.  . . a <br/>
pair of pointe shoes.  Of course!  She always regretted quitting ballet <br/>
lessons!  She was but five years-old when they told her that her feet <br/>
were yet too small and undeveloped for a pair of pointe shoes. <br/>
Heartbroken, as only a five year-old ballerina can be, she quit. Perhaps <br/>
another year would have been enough, but the prospect of one year is far <br/>
and daunting to one for whom a year is twenty percent of their entire <br/>
existence thus far.  She quit.  Her choice was made.  Today she would <br/>
learn to be a part of dance in whatever way she could.  She would learn <br/>
to recognize quality, appreciate the endless hours of bloodied feet, <br/>
clammy skin, and muscles completely tapped of resources.   As she <br/>
approached the exercise bar of knowledge she sought, she smiled and <br/>
wondered once more. . . what strange bedfellows would she discover <br/>
sharing the shelves with Balanchine.<br/>
