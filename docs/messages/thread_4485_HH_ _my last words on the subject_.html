                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to those of you who have responded both on-and off-list with <br/>
your support and agreement regarding hitchhikers. Your suggestions <br/>
have been great and we'll use them!<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete: your individual experience of a 4% "find" rate of <br/>
hitchers is so very different than ours (it would be 60% in our <br/>
case). It does sound like the market's flooded if 6 of your last 10 <br/>
boxes had HH's in them.<br/>
<br/>
You are correct that we were delighted to have found our first <br/>
hitchhiker (one of yours) after 3 years of letterboxing. My concern <br/>
lies in the fact that if hitchhikers continue to proliferate (and <br/>
they will) then they will become commonplace. In fact, they already <br/>
are. More is NOT always better, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
Hitchhikers hold limited interest for us now that we've found a few. <br/>
We will continue to enjoy letterboxing to appreciate nature, <br/>
beautiful trails interesting places and scenic views. That, in my <br/>
opinion, is the essence of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Good night.<br/>
