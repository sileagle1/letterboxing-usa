                    <html><body>Just got back from a long weekend at the beach.  Of course while there, I had to go looking for some boxes!  Would just like to say... I have spent the entire summer hiking around Maryland with very little trouble.  I got a very mild case of poison ivy a few weeks ago, and maybe two mosquito bites all summer.  Then, I go to Delaware and I become bug food.  I was attacked by this HUGE black cloud of mosquitos.  In a matter of a minute, I successfully accumulated over 20 mosquito bites.  I RAN to my car to escape them, but they still managed to suck down a pint or two of my blood.  And yes, I am whining about it!<br/>
<br/>
Anways....<br/>
Here's an update of the boxes I found...<br/>
<br/>
Assawoman Wildlife Area - The Squirrels weren't kidding when they said it is harder to find the park than it is to find the box!  It was quite an adventure, but I found it!  This would be the sight of the ATTACK OF THE KILLER MOSQUITOS.  The box is in good shape and seems to have had a fair amount of visitors this summer.  The Squirrels strike again!<br/>
<br/>
Ducky Letterbox - in good shape, and NO mosquitos!  Did pick up a sad little octopus hitchhiker.  Sad because he has no log book.  It was just a little tiny stamp with a slip of paper that said "This is a hitchhiker."  If anyone knows where this little guy started his journey, please contact me.  I'm happy to add a log book to his life!<br/>
<br/>
Gordon's Pond, Rehoboth - What a GORGEOUS place!  I've been going to Bethany for over 20 years, and never knew this park existed.  It really was lovely.  I enjoyed the hike and the stamp is really cool.  I like this area so much that I planted a box there!  Clues to come!<br/>
<br/>
Cape Henlopen Tower - I loved the clues to this.  Very imaginative.  Sad to say however that the letterbox/pencil case is not holding up well at all.  The log book was completely soaked.  I would have replaced it, but I had nothing with me.  Also, the stamp was oddly "smushy."  I couldn't figure out what it was made from, but it seems like maybe it has suffered from the summer heat.  It looked like maybe it had melted.<br/>
<br/>
Could not find the Squirrels Cape Henlopen box.  I have to admit, I didn't try really hard because there were LOTS of people around  (and I was pretty exhausted by this point).  But I was perplexed by the "Follow the buried metal to the bay" clue.  I tried a few different approaches to this clue, but none were successful.  I have to say that it was worth the trip anyways.  I loved the view and the lighthouse.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the Gordon Pond box, I also planted another box near Bethany.  I'll be posting the clues soon.<br/>
