Natural Area, near Norway MI. <br/>
I already knew what letterboxing was and had heard there was one and<br/>
possibly 2 boxes at Fumee, but they are the first people I'd ever met<br/>
who particiapated in the hobby. I loved the stamps in thier log book, <br/>
they are interesting and original art of an equally interesting hobby.<br/>
I am hoping that they participate in this news group, because I am<br/>
curious if they were successfull at Fumee. I'd hoped to see them before<br/>
I had to leave but had to go to work before they came out. <br/>
I hope you enjoyed your walk around Fumee Lake.<br/>
