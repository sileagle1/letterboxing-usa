<br/>
Always hard to suggest boxes and leave others out.  Plus it depends on<br/>
what type of boxes you like.  I'd check out all the boxes in the area<br/>
you'll be in and peruse the clues.<br/>
<br/>
In Greater Boston, there are a bunch of boxes in Jamaica Plain.  I<br/>
haven't got many of these boxes, but it's a good place to go to get<br/>
more boxes.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few boxes on the Esplanade, and if you're in Boston during<br/>
the weekday, Little Prince is an interesting box.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
