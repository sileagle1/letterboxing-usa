                    <div class="plaintext-content">I figured I would take a moment from carving (yes, I am actually almost <br/>
done the event stamp) to send out an announcement to let everyone know <br/>
that all is good for the Ice Breaker Gathering in Herndon, VA.<br/>
<br/>
Everything is a go and it looks good for Sunday as far as the restaurant <br/>
goes.  They know we are coming and should be ready for us.  Remember, <br/>
this is The Breeze in Herndon, not the one in Ashburn.<br/>
<br/>
When you come into the restaurant, just come up stairs and go to your <br/>
left.  You can sign in on the event board and get the official event <br/>
stamp.  There will be lots of new faces, don't be afraid to say hi to <br/>
folks, get exchanges, have fun with the other event stamps, personal <br/>
travelers and the like.  This is very casual.  Come when you want and <br/>
stay as long as you like.<br/>
<br/>
The forecast right now is showing rain but no cold weather, so a good <br/>
day for an indoor gathering.<br/>
<br/>
So I hope to see a lot of folks out that day!<br/>
<br/>
I case you didn't hear the first time, here are the vitals:<br/>
