                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many thanks to Music Woman for getting all those great boxes carved <br/>
and planted for yesterday's event.  Big thanks also, to all the <br/>
carvers-Chuck, Butterfly, Engraver, and music Woman (hope I didn't <br/>
forget anyone!) Such wonderful stamps. The trails to the boxes were <br/>
fun-what  a great park!<br/>
I have to admit that we didn't spend oodles of time at the other <br/>
exhibits- too many boxes to get!!,but the DEP deserves a big hand- <br/>
well done!<br/>
Looking at our stamp-in poster, I see I have more exchanges to get-- <br/>
another day-- Happy Boxing Everyone-Sunshine and Swamp Yankee, and <br/>
the ToadDog, who made another LB'ing rescue by finding Butterfly's <br/>
wayward hat on the trail!!! Good Boy!!!<br/>
