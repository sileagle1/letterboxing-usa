I just finished the Monk's Tale Letterbox Series in Cumberland, RI and all the boxes are fine, almost.  It took me three tries to find the 2nd box but it was right were the clues said it would be. I kept getting to the site just as it got dark and I would miss it's hiding spot. Now the almost part. As My wife and our two dogs found box # 3, I moved a downed tree at the site and disturbed the home of a few hundred very mad bees.  It was quit a sight watching Grady (my 3 year old Choc. Lab) racing threw the woods performing some amazing high speed rolls to strip the bees off of him. It took us maybe 200 yards or so to get away from the angry swarm. After checking the dogs and ourselves for damage, we took stock of our belongings. Shaking my head, I headed back to the hive, there sitting next to the beehive was my day pack, with our journals and stamps. Next to them was the opened third letterbox. Being the crazed Letterboxer that I am, I not so stealthily recovered the items with only a half dozen more stings as the result. I fear though, that I dropped the box's pen into the hive. The bees can keep the pen. Heading back to my family, we sit down to stamp in. Our other dog Oak (a 8 year old, Hundred pound Golden) stuck his head into my pack, most likely looking for food and found instead bees. He got stung on the nose.  Final score Bees 20 or more, Letterboxers 3 more stamps. Well needless to say we didn't replace the letterbox in the same spot.<br/>

Follow the original clues till you get to the Large Rock Out Crop. Take 8 steps or about 24' along the rock and turn to the out crop.  Hid at the mouth of a small cave it Letterbox 3.  <br/>

Thanks for a great series<br/>
