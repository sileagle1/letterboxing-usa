I just wanted to say that I hope that everyone enjoys my first <br/>
series "My Favorite Musicals." I would like to take this time to <br/>
thank my Mom (Leader of the Pack) for all of the time and work she <br/>
put into helping me with this project. I also want to thank the <br/>
Psychokiwis for the awesome webpage. Wanda and Pete for the special <br/>
addition. And, last but certainly not least, Butterfly for all the <br/>
support, friendship, and helping my mom with the last errand needed <br/>
to get this series posted. <br/>
Enjoy the Series!<br/>
