<br/>
Thanks to some diligent letterboxers giving me a heads up (i.e.,<br/>
CampFire Lady, Carie of Lennens 3, Wild Woman and She Bear of 3) John<br/>
and I hiked on the Dogwood Trail and checked out Who Let The Dogs Out! <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say the reports are true and confirmed.  My easy clues had<br/>
turned difficult (thanks to Mother Nature being herself and a missing<br/>
mutt).  With specific landmarks gone and the replaced letterbox of Dog<br/>
#2 once again history I have revised the clues.  This is now a Who Let<br/>
The Dogs Out - 3 Dog Night.  In other words.  Dog #2 will not be<br/>
replaced AGAIN and I've eliminated landmarks that no longer exist.  <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, my clues are pathetically easy once more and people will be<br/>
able to have fun looking for this series without scratching their heads<br/>
in confusion and dismay.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you!!!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
