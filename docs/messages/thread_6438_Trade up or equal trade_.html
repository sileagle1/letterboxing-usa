Hey, forks make great digging tools, and weapons to fight off those <br/>
nasty bugs (like a sister). Plus someone left an expired Kinko card.<br/>
Now what can you do with that? Mom did say that we would go back and <br/>
add to the box since it lacked the cool kids items. Just another <br/>
reason to hike that steep hill again.<br/>
<br/>
To Trey- I am gifted! Plus my sister helped me write the messages and <br/>
she corrects my spelling. My Aunt,pyscomommy2003, keeps telling my <br/>
Mom that I will be bored in kindergarten. I hope that I don't have to <br/>
glue beans on the alphabets again. Had to do that in preK , so I <br/>
became a preK drop out. <br/>
<br/>
To Jerry P.- Thanks for the info. Now I just have to convince Mom and <br/>
Dad to drive across the U.S. I know, I will promise not to say "Are <br/>
we there yet". That really gets them mad.  <br/>

  Silver or stainless steel would work!  Yes Trey, Lizardbutt is 5.  <br/>
I call him our frustrated genius.<br/>

<br/>
maybe you should go to www.geocaching.com and look at the message <br/>
boards there.  You can get an idea of how it this game works.<br/>
