Crosswinds Marsh series, and along with them I placed three <br/>
hitchhikers (one is new). The details are below:<br/>
<br/>
Backpacker - Placed with the Crosswinds Marsh letterbox, Sumpter <br/>
Township (south of Belleville), Wayne County, Michigan.<br/>
<br/>
IL to MI (also called "Mirkwood," sent to me by Mohmers last year) - <br/>
Placed with the Bald Eagle letterbox, Sumpter Township (south of <br/>
Belleville), Wayne County, Michigan.<br/>
<br/>
Painted Turtle - Placed with the Crosswinds Marsh letterbox, Sumpter <br/>
Township (south of Belleville), Wayne County, Michigan.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be posting the clues to the new Crosswinds Marsh and Bald Eagle <br/>
letterboxes later today.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, we also picked a quart of wild black raspberries to make <br/>
a pie! YAY!<br/>
