(of the Mexico, Mom &amp; Me series at Mary S. Young) vandalized.  The broken <br/>
box, and both its notebook and stamp (a pitcher) were scattered near where we <br/>
think it would have been hidden.  I threw away the worthless box, but have <br/>
the notebook &amp; stamp here at my house. I'd be happy to send them to you--or <br/>
could try to replace them <br/>
in a new box,  but I fear that the little log we thought they might <br/>
have been near is too exposed at this time of year...  Let me know <br/>
what you'd like me to do with them, please!I <br/>
<br/>
Also--alas!--I believe the first two boxes are missing.  The plants <br/>
have really died back, I think, from when you planted the boxes, so <br/>
that they became obvious (or maybe the ivy-pulling crew found them).  <br/>
<br/>
We did find the remaining #4 and #6--which was both a relief and fun!<br/>
