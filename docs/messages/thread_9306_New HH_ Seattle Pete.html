Just because he's called Seattle Pete doesn't mean he's in <br/>
Seattle.  And just because I found the Canadian Walk series <br/>
recently doesn't mean it's in Canada.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it could also be in either of those places.  Or not.  Who <br/>
knows?  =)  The stamp actually got it's name because I got the <br/>
picture from a book that had a drawing of a "hippy" Seattlite that I <br/>
thought was cute.  He's so gruffy looking, he LOOKS like a <br/>
hitchhiker, and thus he became one.  Homeless and roaming <br/>
the world, just like me!  =)<br/>
