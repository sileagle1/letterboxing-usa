                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finally got the chance to start placing a series I have had in boxes <br/>
since last November.  It is called Chuck's Tacklebox Series and <br/>
combines my love for both freshwater fishing and letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I have 12 stamps/boxes in all ready to go and just placed the first <br/>
2.  Each set in the series will be 2 boxes placed at one of my <br/>
favorite fishing lakes in Thurston and Pierce Counties.  There will <br/>
be one box hidden at the public launch area for those without access <br/>
to a boat and one or more boxes placed somewhere on the lake itself <br/>
(usually hidden along an undeveloped shoreline).  I hope to get at <br/>
least 3 more sets placed by the end of this weekend so watch for them <br/>
soon.<br/>
<br/>
The first set is located at Lake St. Clair near Lacey in Thurston <br/>
County.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and let me know how you like the boating adventure!<br/>
