For those of you still in need, here are the steps:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Go to http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/index.html<br/>
<br/>
Click on the state you want, or choose the state from the drop-down <br/>
list on the left side of the window then click the blue "Go" button.<br/>
<br/>
Look at the top of the next window for a logo in the shape of the <br/>
state.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately below that is a line that says something like "South <br/>
Carolina Counties--- view map".  Click on the little link that <br/>
says "view map".<br/>
<br/>
It's really not very obvious, which is why I was so excited to <br/>
stumble on it.  Like has already been mentioned, check your printout <br/>
when you're done and see if you might have to turn it landscape to <br/>
get it all on paper.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just as a suggestion, I create a new file folder whenever I print a <br/>
new state.  I mark each county in highlighter that has boxes in it.  <br/>
This helps me when I travel.  If I print off a new clue from the <br/>
website as it's released, I mark off the county if it's new and add <br/>
it to the folder.  Naturally I remove them as I find them.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, probably too organized, but I'm a teacher.  LOL  I also can't <br/>
imagine driving right by one on a trip and not getting it!!  ;-)<br/>
