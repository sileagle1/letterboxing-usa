I've been trying to figure out how to get there and am so addicted to <br/>
letterboxing that I've almost abandoned my husband this upcoming <br/>
weekend.  We closed on our first house this morning so we'll be <br/>
moving into it this weekend.  While I'm so excited about that I keep <br/>
feeling tugged to head to the northwest to share in all the <br/>
letterboxing fun since there's not much action here in Idaho.  Thank <br/>
you though to Amanda and Ryan who placed some boxes for me when they <br/>
travelled through here last month. Amanda stamped in for her 300th at <br/>
the Eagle, ID box...woo hoo!  I think Ryan's somewhere near that <br/>
count too, maybe surpasses it now.  I greatly appreciate those boxes <br/>
here.  Thanks.  <br/>
    This entire househunting and purchasing process has put a damper  <br/>
on my letterboxing craze. Of course my husband feels it's hindering <br/>
his time to work on "TANK" (his suburban).  One of these days I hope <br/>
he'll get hooked on LBing though.  I'm excited we'll be moving soon, <br/>
but wish my sister would have planned the FEST another day.  =-)  <br/>
Lots of love DVN2CKR  I guess the west coast will have to have <br/>
another FEST in the near future so I can join in on all the fun.  <br/>
=-)  Have fun without me.  I so wish I could be there.  Hopefully the <br/>
boxes will stay in place so we can hunt some of them when we visit <br/>
over Thanksgiving.  <br/>
  I'm so hooked as a newbie.  It's great!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all you RAK senders out there.  I love all the creativity.  <br/>
Bless you!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail (of course not soon enough as I'm currently <br/>
trapped in the moving phase between houses).<br/>
 Aryn from Eagle soon to be Aryn from Star, ID.<br/>

Actually, I'm up to 296 boxes found now.  If I haven't broken 300 <br/>
by the Letterboxing Fest, I'll certainly be breaking it AT the <br/>
Letterboxing Fest.  (It looks like I'm not going to have any time to <br/>
hunt anymore boxes before the great event, though.  *sniffle*  <br/>
Houses to paint, stamps to carve, and that sort of stuff.)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you won't be able to make it there, though, because we'd <br/>
certainly love to see you again!  There will be other letterboxing <br/>
events in the area at some point, though, don't you worry about <br/>
that!<br/>
