My son lives in Woodstock, Ct., the Northeast corner of the state. He is still without electricty and water.  He has a well.<br/>
We had hoped to all ( we on Long Island, &amp; NH)  be together to celebrate his 50th birthday on Labor Day weeekend.<br/>
He did get his boat out of slip in time. He did complete the new barn.  The last one was distroyed by the heavy snow this winter.<br/>
<br/>
So I count my blessing.  We had two large branches down. One just missed the house and landed in front of our back door.<br/>
We only had two days without electricty. We still don't have electricty at work.  I work at a historic house at the County Park.<br/>

We just got our power back today.  We live on the east side of the state of Connecticut and got more wind and less rain.  There were many downed trees, but only a few lives were lost due to Irene.  <br/>

We're still waiting--we've been out since Sunday 2 AM.  No power, phone, water (most people in our town have wells).  But they have the middle school set up as a shelter, with showers, food, and water available.  Currently on my computer at work! <br/>
