Please do not go to get this box on October 8, 15, and 21st unless <br/>
you can get there before 2 PM. The Andover High Cross Country team <br/>
uses this area for their racing trail!<br/>
<br/>
Where: Reservation Road<br/>
Parking: Parking is located inside the gate of West Parish Cemetary <br/>
or along the road, but its easier to park at West Parish.<br/>
<br/>
To get to the trail:<br/>
Walk down Reservation Road for a very short distance. The entrance to <br/>
the trail will be on your left.<br/>
<br/>
Easy terrain, boardwalks and a cut path through a slightly rolling <br/>
field.<br/>
<br/>
Stamp: Handcarved.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
<br/>
Walk through the trailhead and onto the boardwalk, making sure to <br/>
check for frogs and other animals along the way. <br/>
Eventually, you will walk through a stone wall. <br/>
Continue through the marshy area.<br/>
You will come out into a field with some great views of foliage in <br/>
the fall.<br/>
Follow the beaten path through the field...do you see the next <br/>
boardwalk?<br/>
Check around the bottom step :)<br/>
<br/>
PS Be very careful while putting the box back! It could slip out of <br/>
your arm's reach. I might go back and fix this part so that it is <br/>
anchored later, clues will be altered if needed.<br/>
