                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was just up in Coventry CT looking for two letterboxes which I <br/>
couldn't find.  The first was at the Brick School House.  The <br/>
outhouse (where the letterbox supposedly was hidden outside of) is <br/>
gone and there aren't any stones to be found except for the stone <br/>
wall.  Is it in the stone wall, or was it part of the outhouse?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I was next door at Laidlaw Park and could not find the "Mousing <br/>
at Laidlaw Park" letterbox.  There was a huge hole in the stone wall, <br/>
and stones moved, where it looked like a letterbox could have been <br/>
placed, but no letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if I am just mistaken, or if the letterboxes are <br/>
indeed missing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Hi Pam  Brick School House is at my house as it was returned after <br/>
the crash of the tree on the outhouse I had posted this info in hopes <br/>
of  sparing anyone a empty trip.  I should be able to return it in a <br/>
day or two. Luckily one of the crew cleaning up the mess recognized <br/>
it and returned it! <br/>
   I heard from someone earlier this week that they found Mousing in <br/>
laidlaw intact. I will try to check when I go to the school house but <br/>
it was literally just a few days ago. <br/>
   I also got notice that Glass Factory needs ink and need to get <br/>
some to replace it with and that is holding up the process. I need to <br/>
do it all in one trip. <br/>
   Sorry for the  empty trip hope your next one more sucessful. Watch <br/>
the list i will post brick schools return. Leader of the PAck<br/>
