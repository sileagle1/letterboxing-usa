DOAH!...good point about the hitchiker. Durn rookies.<br/>
<br/>
I was warned about Chatham by another letterboxer who had previously <br/>
put box there and had a slightly more "involved" event with the folks <br/>
at Chatham. He advised me to recover the box and move it soon. So I <br/>
went back the next day, recovered the box and moved it to a new <br/>
location (see later posting on this page) The box will now be <br/>
called "Dead Snellings and Weeds".....which will all be explained <br/>
when you find the box.<br/>
