Hi Andrea and Elisa,<br/>
We found the 70 million years letterbox Sunday May 12th at about 6 <br/>
o'clock at night.  It was our second attempt to find the box (we went <br/>
the day before too).  But I assure you that the box is alive and well <br/>
and not at all extinct.  It is, however, pretty well hidden!  And we <br/>
did not require a backhoe ;)<br/>
<br/>
Cool stamp, Andrea!<br/>
<br/>
