&gt; � a week later I went to Delaware and used the Lewis Library<br/>
&gt; computer � after emptying my wallet to purchase an out-of-stater<br/>
&gt; library card - cause they don't take American Express - VISA,<br/>
&gt; Mastercard, Discover . . .and neither did the Bait &amp; Tackle Shop where<br/>
&gt; the annual pass to the DE State Parks sucked up another fifty four<br/>
&gt; dollars, and all this expense after having to pay cash to get across the<br/>
&gt; Chesapeake Bay Bridge/Tunnel cuss they don't take EZPass!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is no way I could have driven with quite literally only one dollar<br/>
&gt; on my person from VA via DE, thru MD, WV, OH, IN, IL, IA, NE, WY and ID<br/>
&gt; to arrive 11 states away in OR. Besides it would have taken me a month<br/>
&gt; of Sundays to print all those mappoint.msn.com maps with all turns shown<br/>
&gt; and every letterbox enroute carefully mapped for the most efficient most<br/>
&gt; boxious journey of my life.  Not to mention, at my clueless pace I'd<br/>
&gt; still be in WV - - where my fashionably challenged acusser has taken up<br/>
&gt; residence and name calling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No sooner have I regained my demure composure after the slam that I<br/>
&gt; might be part of a RedHat Box'r gang, well not in just those words,<br/>
&gt; but I felt that was what was meant; than I am indirectly acussed via my<br/>
&gt; other affiliation. Yes, I was the last to join the Baker's Dozen and<br/>
&gt; had I know then where such an unlucky number would landed me in the LB<br/>
&gt; community I . . . would have gone anyway because I have a Dartmoor One<br/>
&gt; Hundred Patch and that is worth more to me than any amount of PZ White<br/>
&gt; Stuff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I recently bought the last of the PZ Orange Stuff --- ooops, I<br/>
&gt; wasn't suppose let that slip. But I need it for carving the MonyLoop<br/>
&gt; State Stamps and all the bonus boxes that will be part of the "It's<br/>
&gt; Just a Game" gather in Killens Pond State Park, Felton DE in October.<br/>
&gt; Check it out on http://de-games.tripod.com/<br/>
&gt; <http: de-games.tripod.com=""></http:>  and sign-up on AQ . . . Hey! I'm not the<br/>
&gt; only one with a plug and no shame!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've been home for a few hours now and have given this caper a whole<br/>
&gt; lot of thought - after I unloaded the car, got the tomatos planted, went<br/>
&gt; through two weeks of mail, fixed dinner, and read three days worth of PZ<br/>
&gt; Caper posts. Now, I can't imagine anyone of the LBMA persuasion<br/>
&gt; being so dastardly (except maybe someone who makes others crawl) as to<br/>
&gt; steal a complete cache of PZ White Stuff. So I looked beyond and<br/>
&gt; eliminated anyone from LBNE, as they are way too serious to violate any<br/>
&gt; of the LB commandments, including not coveting thy neighbors PZ White<br/>
&gt; Stuff. Now, I have traveled to the LBSE and part took of a gather in<br/>
&gt; Charlotte, and have even boxed in GA, AL and FL. They seem to be really<br/>
&gt; nice folk and not prone to using PZ White Stuff. Since I hope to return<br/>
&gt; next year my suspicions must be directed further away . . . from any<br/>
&gt; face to face retaliation. Hmmmm, Texas is a big state doing things in<br/>
&gt; big ways --- like taking ALL the PZ white stuff, not just enough for a<br/>
&gt; dozen stamps or so. There sure are a lot of members on AQ, but one name<br/>
&gt; that jumps out from Texas is that Barefoot Lucy gal. Seems she has stuff<br/>
&gt; under her bed that she's not talking about. And what's with the<br/>
&gt; bare feet? Sneaking around so she won't be heard??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And get this, she has a hobby of storytelling . . . sounds more like a<br/>
&gt; habit and I'm sure she's going to tell us a big one! Better get<br/>
&gt; Inspector Frankfurter on her trail quick!<br/>
