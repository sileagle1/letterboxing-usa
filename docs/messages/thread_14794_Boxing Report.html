This past weekend we went to say goodbye to our Devil Dawg who is <br/>
leaving on his second Iraq deployment next week.  Of course, this <br/>
means we went boxing on a beautiful Carolina Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
We found:<br/>
<br/>
Pine 4 You - Wilmington, NC, by kilroy.  All 4 boxes doing great.  <br/>
Devil Dawg's girlfriend's first found boxes.  She's hooked of course!<br/>
<br/>
Blockade Runner - Wilmington, NC, by Amanda from Seattle.  Great <br/>
stamp!  We saw beautiful blue herons by the lake.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to South Carolina - Little River, SC, by Green Tortuga.  <br/>
Carving so precise it looks for all the world store-bought.<br/>
<br/>
Wayward Viking - Little River, SC, by noydb.  What a wild place, and <br/>
a very clever placement!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your artistry and for taking us to such great <br/>
places.  It made a difficult weekend (for Mom) much easier.<br/>

I will sure to do that.  Ryan loves his life as a Marine, and I'm <br/>
obviously very proud.  But I'll miss him because he can ferret out a <br/>
box ANYWHERE.  He gets all the credit for a lot of our finds.  Can't <br/>
wait until he's back home.<br/>
