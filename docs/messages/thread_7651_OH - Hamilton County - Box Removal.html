In Greene County, we recently underwent a drastic change in the <br/>
requirements for boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
In the last week of August, the park system sent out notices to <br/>
geocachers/letterboxers they knew of, telling them they had to get <br/>
their boxes out of the parks by 1 September.  Since I had previously <br/>
led the park rangers to each of my boxes, they had my name, address, <br/>
and knew where all my boxes were.  I complied with their <br/>
requirement.  <br/>
<br/>
They have a registration system now in place for each box.  Here are <br/>
the requirements:<br/>
<br/>
- Before a box is put out the site has to be registered with them and <br/>
approved.<br/>
<br/>
- The box can not be an ammo box<br/>
<br/>
- The box can not be more than 20 feet from a trail<br/>
<br/>
- The box must be checked monthly by the placer<br/>
<br/>
- The box must be moved and re-registered each December 31st.  <br/>
<br/>
Most of these requirements are based on a system which a park system <br/>
in northern Ohio put into place last year.  They seem to be heavily <br/>
based on geocaching, and large numbers of people coming to a box.  <br/>
When I mentioned that my geocaches attract about 50 logged visits a <br/>
year and my boxes attract 1-10 visits per year, the ranger seemed <br/>
possibly interested in deleting the move every Dec 31 requirement.  <br/>
We are to talk about this in November. <br/>
<br/>
There is an implied threat that any box not removed in the original <br/>
announcement will be dealt with as abandoned property and the person <br/>
who left it could be cited.<br/>
<br/>
It remains to be seen whether the Hamilton County move is part of a <br/>
parallel process.  <br/>
<br/>
What I am doing here in Dayton:  I moved all my Geocaches out of the <br/>
Greene County Parks.  (It seems very hard to hide a geocache within <br/>
20 feet of a trail and not have it looted.)  I will put several <br/>
letterboxes back in, but have not yet applied for the privledge.<br/>
<br/>
The state parks still seem open to letterboxing.  <br/>
