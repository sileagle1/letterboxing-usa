                    <html><body>Jay, these are additional boxes planted on Onion Mt in West Simsbury to go with the Directed Paths box already placed there.  Can you add these clues to it and change the name to Onion Mt Park?  Thanks<br/>
-----------<br/>
Planted 11/7/02 by Cherieph and RTRW on a beautiful, COLD fall day.<br/>
It will probably take about 2 hours to do this, maybe a bit longer, unless you get lost....<br/>
<br/>
We couldn't decide on a name for this series, considering both The Eclectic Boxes and The Winter's-Coming-and-I-Have-to-Get-These-Planted-NOW  Series, but will be happy with Onion Mt Boxes.<br/>
<br/>
This is a park on West Simsbury Road near Flamig Farm. It can be reached from Rt 44 and Bushy Hill (rt 167) where Avon, Simsbury and Canton meet.<br/>
<br/>
Here are directions to all the boxes planted there.  Please note that Directed Paths is already listed in the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Pull in past the stone house and park.  To the right is a fishing area, or at least a pond.  There is a trail map container and if you are lucky you will find a map.  If not, there is a trail sign nailed to the tree.  Take a look and you won't get lost like we did!<br/>
We tried to make this a loop, but the Red Trail doesn't connect with anything.  We found this out the hard way and ended up in someone's yard!  "Sorry, but we're lost" worked well.<br/>
<br/>
To find  the <u>Directed Paths  Box</u> you need to follow the yellow trail.  Pass the fire circle on the left and then at the junction take the trail to the left (150 degrees).  This bends to the left and then to the right as you go along.  Just keep to the yellow blazes and you'll be fine.  Pass a bunch of downed trees real near the trail.  Stand between the sawed logs and direct your path ahead 15 paces to a yellow blazed tree.  A straight compass reading of 260 degrees leads you to your prize BUT direct your steps along the path to the 2nd yellow blaze beyond the one you are at now.  With your back to the blaze your path is directed at 330 degrees and about 10 steps.  there is your prize.<br/>
<br/>
Continue along yellow until it meets the orange trail.  These trails have nice markers and junctions should be easy to spot.<br/>
Orange climbs and climbs until you reach a steep, rocky spot with a nice drop off to the right as you walk the path.  At this point (and there is a downed pine pointing downhill to the right of the trail here) take aproximately 11 steps to an orange blazed tree and then a compass reading of 320 degrees.  Look to a 3 trunk tree up hill of you.  Somewhere near there is Box #2, <u>Streams to the Sea.<br/>
<br/>
</u>Continue on the orange trail up the "Rub-a-duc" hills (if you have been to the American Legion Forest boxes you will understand).  After orange begins its descent a bit, watch for the white trail to join in on the left. (I don't remember a trail sign as such at this point).  When White takes a sharp turn to the right, on the right of the trail are several fallen trees, including a birch.  Look behind this for Box #3 <u>Let Sleeping Cats Lie</u>.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on White (here is where we got lost trying a different route to the next box.  SO, if you have any trouble, let me know and I'll go retrace our steps).  You are looking for a place near the far end of the  White trail where there are again a bunch of fallen trees.  One of them to the right of the trail is uprooted-and it's a BIG one.  Look in or near the roots for Box #4 <u>Suppertime and the Livin' is Easy</u>.  If you get to several tree 'knees' on the left you have gone too far.<br/>
<br/>
Now, take White to Orange and then down  (left)to the Orange-Red-Blue junction.  Follow the BLAZES now and not the trail signs.  Someone so kindly reversed Red and Blue here.  Go LEFT onto the Red trail (remember, this is NOT a loop).  Be careful to follow the blazes as the trail thins and turns.  There is a blaze on a tree which has fallen across the trail just before a sharp right turn.  To the left of where the fallen tree lodges is Box #5 <u>Flamig Farm</u>.<br/>
When you stamp in be sure the word is BACKWARDS.  You wouldn't want to be accused of advertising for the farm, would you?  It's much better to display ART.  (Check out the farm when you leave.  It's just up the road a bit.  There is a petting zoo with a nominal fee, really FRESH eggs, and other interesting things in the farm store.  It has been run by the Christensen family for generations.)<br/>
<br/>
Return to the Red-Blue-Orange junction and this time head down the Blue blazed trail.  Go around a downed tree towards the right and check underneath the tree for Box #6 <u>The Blue Door</u>.  There was an antique store near here called that once upon a time.  <br/>
<br/>
Now you can head down the blue trail to get back to your car.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to RTRW for carving all but Flamig Farm and doing such a wonderful job.  I'm especially fond of the Blue Door!<br/>
