I'm planning on planting my first hitchhiker this weekend.  I bought <br/>
a notebook for it, but it seems too big, it's 3 x 5 and about 1 inch thick.<br/>
<br/>
Is this too big?  Should I try to remove some pages?  Any suggestions for this?<br/>
<br/>
Also, do you write your email or phone # on the stamp in case it gets <br/>
separated?<br/>
<br/>
How much instruction do you write in the journal about it being a <br/>
hitchhiker, how to return it, etc?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
 The whole thing, stamp and log should probably not be more than 1 inch and probably less. Your log may be too thick and consider that unless it stays in a busy area, you will have probably 20-30 finders if it stays active for 4 or more years and 40 pages of a journal would be more than enough. It sounds like you've bound or have a wire bound deck of 100 file cards. My busiest hikers have 2 hits each in five months.<br/>
<br/>
 Some complete Hitchhikers fit inside film cans for example. A valid e-mail is a must if you want to be notified however most finders will not register it or contact you if it is found.<br/>
<br/>
 Register the box as a hitchhiker and label all contents as such and try to imagine what would happen if the worst boxer in the world got a hold of it. That is to say..make it as foolproof as possible.<br/>
