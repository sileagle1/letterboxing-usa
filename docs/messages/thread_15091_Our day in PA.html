it, but it's really just me posting about our day of 'boxing. :)<br/>
<br/>
We headed up to Newtown, PA yesterday for the Tyler State Park boxes. <br/>
They were all in good shape (except the stamp in #2 is broken. Still <br/>
stamps though.)and the locations were beautiful. <br/>
We had an added surprise as we also found our first HH. WooooHoooo!  <br/>
It was the San Marco HH and it's in great shape, and has been <br/>
around. :)  We placed our first HH yesterday too. (No, it wasn't the <br/>
same one we found. LOL)  I think San Marco will have to reside <br/>
someplace in DE for awhile since we hardly get any HH's around these <br/>
parts. :)<br/>

PS-Do you count placed HH's in your placed count? <br/>
