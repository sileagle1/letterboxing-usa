It is not an original drawing because I can't free hand anything but <br/>
stick figures (&amp; even those are questionable), so I hope it doesn't <br/>

let me know and I will pull it. <br/>

vote that this should become "The" Smithsonian letterbox that would <br/>
be kept behind the front counter, just waiting for you to ask to <br/>
stamp into it. <br/>

Smithsonian file. So far, mine is the only submission. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; About the stamp: It took me 4 days (whenever I had time) to carve <br/>
it. I'm guessing it took about 6-7 hours total. It is carved on PZ <br/>
Kut using a #1 Speedball blade only. The secret to fine detail is <br/>
using a magnifying glass and getting a clear transfer to the rubber <br/>
which I get using the heat transfer method.<br/>

ink is actually particles that are heat bonded then sealed by the new <br/>

<br/>
Once you make a copy of your image with the older ink/copier, just <br/>
place it face down on the rubber and cover with a hot iron for a few <br/>
seconds. Keep checking the transfer every few seconds by peeling back <br/>
the paper a bit. You don't want to melt the rubber, but it does take <br/>
a fair amount of heat to transfer it. When you get a good transfer, <br/>
peel off the image while it is still hot (so the paper doesn't stick <br/>

Good Luck! I also highly, highly recommend a magnifying glass. I <br/>
couldn't believe the difference one made in the quality of my <br/>

light your subject, but also creates shadows where you have carved, <br/>
so it's easier to see where your cuts are being made.<br/>
