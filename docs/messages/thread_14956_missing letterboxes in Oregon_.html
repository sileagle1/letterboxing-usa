                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good morning, Rose, and welcome! I am also a newbie. From what I can <br/>
gather, a box is declared 'missing' when either:<br/>
<br/>
1. someone - or several letterboxers - go hunting for it, and are <br/>
pretty sure they are in the right location but can't find it. They <br/>
will normally email the planter of the box as check with them, <br/>
telling him/her where they were looking. Then if the planter <br/>
says 'yes, that's the exact location where the box should have <br/>
been', one can be fairly sure it is missing. The planter, if heshe <br/>
is able to, will go check in person. If indeed the box is gone, then <br/>
the planter may elect to plant another in the same location. <br/>
<br/>
OR<br/>
<br/>
2. The planter, on his/her regular maintenance check sees that their <br/>
letterbox is gone. <br/>
<br/>
So yes, I would say it is an excellent idea to check the new Box <br/>
Status chart that Abacus set up in the database of this website. It <br/>
is an excellent way to quickly check on all letterboxes before you <br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
As to your question :&gt; "When do I figure a box I am looking for is <br/>
gone?" ... If you are looking, and really feel that you are in the <br/>
right location and everything else pretty much matches the clues, <br/>
but there is no box, then come home and email the planter, as I said <br/>
earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun! :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Rose,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to let you know that there is a list-serve for our region of the <br/>
country--you can check out the PNW list-serve at <br/>
groups.yahoo.com/group/LbPNW --it's all about WA/OR boxing.  Generally, after <br/>
a new box is planted, someone who finds it has something to say about it <br/>
there, so you can get a feel for what you might be getting yourself in for by <br/>
hunting for it.<br/>
<br/>
You can search for a specific box using the archives of the main list, tho <br/>
that can be tedious (you can also check the PNW list, but that's a more <br/>
recent <br/>
creation and certainly doesn't list all the boxes).  <br/>
<br/>
I see you've already discovered the new database that Mahjong set up--and <br/>
have reported that you couldn't find the Lincoln City box.  But there was some <br/>
recent chatter about that box on the PNW list--as of Aug. 3, the box was still <br/>
in place (sounds like it might be a tricky find, tho).  Check out Wingnut's <br/>
report, message #1340 on the PNW list-serve--you may want to change your listing <br/>
on the new database.<br/>
<br/>
As you continue to find boxes,  you'll learn that some of the people who <br/>
plant boxes are notoriously tricky, so--since you're concerned about not finding <br/>
boxes--you might choose to avoid their boxes (Der Mad Stamper's boxes can be <br/>
straightforward OR difficult--his box at Multnomah Falls is thought to be one of <br/>
the most maddening in our region.)  <br/>
<br/>
A box listed as "Abandoned" may or may not still be in place.  As someone <br/>
else mentioned in their reply to you, this listing came about as a result of <br/>
a <br/>
change in how we list boxes on the site.  Things are still settling down a <br/>
bit <br/>
from that change--some of the boxes are there, but the owner hasn't "claimed" <br/>
them since the change.  These may get adopted, if someone volunteers to look <br/>
after them.  Some of the "abandoned" boxes--like the one at Powell's--really <br/>
ARE <br/>
gone, and will be either replaced or deleted from the list.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a box is reported as "missing" to the list-serve--but unless the <br/>
owner checks on it--or maybe someone who has found it before &amp; knows for sure <br/>
where it was hidden--there's some question as to whether or not it really is <br/>
missing.  Not long ago, I was pretty sure that Funhog's Wapiti box at the zoo <br/>
was <br/>
missing--and sent a message to the PNW list about it.  Brett, who'd been <br/>
there before checked, and it was still there.  So it's fine to report to the <br/>
list--or better yet, directly to the owner--that a box appears to be missing, <br/>
but <br/>
it usually takes other boxers to confirm that report.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that clarifies things!<br/>
