<br/>
John and I spent the weekend camping down in Southeastern Oregon in the<br/>
Steens Mountain area.  It was his first time there and I was so glad to<br/>
take him.  It's such a remarkable place.  I can never tire of it.  <br/>
<br/>
We searched and searched for Randy Hall The MapSurfer's Steens Mountain<br/>
Letterbox, but after an hour and 1/2 of searching, we came up<br/>
empty-handed.  The Steens are notoriously prone to extreme weather<br/>
conditions that can change the environment, so it may be the box has<br/>
gone missing.  Could be we just couldn't find it, either.  I don't know,<br/>
though.  We tried everything we could think of.  I think we must have<br/>
overturned every rock around there!  <br/>
<br/>
Though we weren't successful in scoring a mapsurfer letterbox, we did<br/>
have the most wonderful weekend in one of the most breathtaking places<br/>
in the state, if not the country.  It just floors you what the power of<br/>
mother nature, time and glaciers can do!  <br/>
<br/>
I did plant a letterbox of our own in lower elevations down at Page<br/>
Springs in Frenchglen while we were there, then had John do the clues to<br/>
verify.  It's not a tough box and the stamp definitely depicts the<br/>
place.   Clues will be posted to the list soon!<br/>
<br/>
It was fun to try to find Randy's box even though it didn't happen.<br/>
It's always worth going to the Steens, letterbox or no, that's for sure!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

<br/>
That is too bad.  I think that is my favorite place in the whole country.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately it is not going to be easy for me to get back there to<br/>
check on it.  It has prolly gone missing as it (was intended to be)<br/>
a very easy box if you get up there.  All the features, hopefully,<br/>
were obvious.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

It's too bad we didn't nab that box.  I was thinking we'd be "ALL THAT"<br/>
if we actually got a Mapsurfer stamp in our personal logbooks!  Perhaps<br/>
someday, but not on this trip.  Oh well. <br/>
I know you've got others planted in Oregon, Randy, so maybe sometime<br/>
when we get over to Cornucopia or Strawberry Mountain or wherever you've<br/>
got them at, we'll have our opportunity then.<br/>
<br/>
