                    <div class="plaintext-content">We searched for the two boxes on Roosevelt Island (Washington DC) <br/>
July 21 and were unable to find "Roosevelt Island" though we are <br/>
certain we were looking in the right spot (Of course we were still <br/>
treated to a beautiful and easy-going hike!).  We did succeed in <br/>
finding "Teddy's Box" with little difficulty.  Though we did get <br/>
stumped up searching in an area with similar surroundings, it made <br/>
the quest more fun!  Thanks Two Gray Squirrels! <br/>
