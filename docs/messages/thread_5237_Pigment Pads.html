<br/>
As a rubberstamp artist, I wouldn't recommend pigment ink as the ink <br/>
of choice for letterboxing.  Pigment ink will stay wet for a long <br/>
time and can be messy in the logbook.  The ink's preferred way to dry <br/>
is with a heat gun.  Plus, it will also make the stamp "gunky" if you <br/>
aren't cleaning it before you leave.<br/>
<br/>
We've had this happen on a box we placed.  We went out to check it <br/>
and noticed the stamp was still coated with someone's pigment ink, <br/>
which made for a messy bag, especially if you combine your stamp and <br/>
logbook in the same bag.<br/>
<br/>
What I would recommend more if you are worried about water, would be <br/>
a waterproof pad.  There are several brands of waterproof ink pads.  <br/>
I use Memories and Ancient Page.  They come in all sorts of colors.  <br/>
These inks will end up staining the stamp, but as long as you clean <br/>
it, it will not interfere with the next inking.<br/>
<br/>
Well, just thought I'd put in my 2 cents.  <br/>
