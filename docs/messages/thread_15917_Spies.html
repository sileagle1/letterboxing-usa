Monday. (I asked them).  They were very pleasant and reassuring about not<br/>
shooting us unwary hikers, in fact joking about being up a tree near a stump<br/>
where a letterbox was hidden."<br/>
<br/>
I guess we should all remember to look UP for non-boxers too! :-) Never know<br/>
who might be watchin'.<br/>
On an unrelated note; Last year, I was in a local park while groups of<br/>
military men &amp; women were practicing their manuvers though the woods ( I<br/>
kept seeing them in the distance through the trees). I kept expecting the<br/>
woods to 'come alive' near me and wondered if any of them had secretely<br/>
watched me as I searched.<br/>
