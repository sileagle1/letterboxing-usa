<br/>
UWGB: #2<br/>
Once on NIcolet Drive, you want the first left turn after the Main<br/>
Entrance.  This will be Bay Shore Center.  Park anywhere you want.  The<br/>
path is on your left as you enter the Center.<br/>
Follow this curvy path through the woods, clearings, etc...  After the<br/>
first spot where you get a look at the Bay Shoreline, the path will<br/>
twist &amp; turn a bit.  Soon it shall take a 90 degree turn to the left. <br/>
You of course want the sandy dirt path to the right in that same<br/>
clearing.  <br/>
Follow this till the adult tree which has tipped over some the weather<br/>
is in view.  You will not miss it.  There nestled in a nook will you<br/>
find the box.  You may have to remove some wood bark pieces, but it is<br/>
there.  God's Speed.<br/>
Terrain, easy.<br/>
<br/>
Heritage Hill - Fur Trader's<br/>
Take any mode of transportation necessary to get yourself to Heritage<br/>
Hill.  It is off 172 w/e highway in Green Bay, WI.<br/>
At the visitor's center, you will receive a map of the Hill.  Follow<br/>
the path through the time travel tunnel and make your way to the Fur<br/>
Trader's Cabin.  (number 2 on the map).<br/>
Right before crossing the bridge to his cabin, there will be a sugar<br/>
house to your right.  Just to the left of that house, there is a small<br/>
path in the thicket leading to the creek.  In the middle of this<br/>
thicket, before the creek, you will find the box.  Again you may have<br/>
to remove a few pieces of wood.  Good Journey.<br/>
Terrain, easy to medium<br/>
<br/>

I do plan on returning, and we had a great time even if we didn't<br/>
have any success on the letterboxing front!<br/>
The new boxes in Green Bay sound great!<br/>
