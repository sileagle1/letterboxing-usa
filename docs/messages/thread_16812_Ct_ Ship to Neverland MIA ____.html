is MIA and will be replaced soon. I will post here when the new ship <br/>
sets sail. Thanks for the heads up on its status. <br/>
   Also stopped by the  Christmas Mystery ( nearby hint hint)  it has <br/>
had some visitors and would love more this one is not that difficult <br/>
folks and you will love its hiding spot! This is the season to really <br/>
enjoy this box plan to spend a little extra time bring the kids and <br/>
grandma too no walking just Christmas Cheer!<br/>
   Not letting the cold rain  keep me in today and tried out a new <br/>
orange vest from walmart  toasty and Loud you could see me for a mile <br/>
feel pretty safe in that blaze orange. I was pleased to meet Queen B <br/>
yesterday with her whole orange entourage and we got a nice trailside <br/>
exchange thanks.    Leader of the Pack<br/>
