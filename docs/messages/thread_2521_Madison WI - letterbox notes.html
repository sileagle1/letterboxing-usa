                    <html><body>Greetings!
<br/>  Went for a weensy walk today to check on letterboxes in the
<br/>Olin-Turville Park today.
<br/>  The Otis Redding box is intact and had five entries! Thanks 
<br/>and thanks again to all who visited &amp; left their mark... 
<br/>Everything seemed dry and fine so I replaced it where it was,
<br/>though the log is disintegrating and so the box may be visible
<br/>to any passerby who glances that way soon...
<br/>  The David Crosby box is gone again, and in fact, the landmark
<br/>tree that it was near is destroyed by storm or lightning or both!
<br/>This one will in all likelihood not be replaced anytime soon. I would 
<br/>make a note of this on the clue page, but I can't remember how I 
<br/>made the clue page in the first place, much less how to change it...
<br/>maybe I can get my daughter to update pages for me now!
<br/>  We'll be going up to check on the "Much Ado" box in late June,
<br/>it's been a loonnnng time and that one may be gone as well.
<br/>  A couple noted that the Otis R. box was easy/too easy, and so 
<br/>no one is disappointed, I will point out now that all boxes placed 
<br/>by me will be one of two things  ....   easy or gone! :-}
<br/>  Still curious as to the whereabouts of the traveling letterbox sent
<br/>out so long ago... let me know if you've seen it!
<br/>  And now back to trying to figure out if the covenant of my neighborhood
<br/>might in any way be interpreted as allowing treehouses...
<br/>   Deborah
<br/>  P/still counting the fingers of one hand...
<br/>  F/appalling! pinkie finger only!
