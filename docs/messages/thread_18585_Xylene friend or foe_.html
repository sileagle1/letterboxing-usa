xylene and it took only 3 min including time to get out the iron and <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't think anyone is suggesting that one way is the only way.  I for one can not get the Acetone method to work for <br/>
me at all.  Mayhap by 3 year old toner cartridge is partially to blame.  I use the heat method to transfer a <br/>
laser printer image (Toner not ink) to the carving medium.  IS that the only way?  Heck no. IS it the best method? <br/>
Each person will determine that.  AS with any hobby, some of the tools and items used are not idiot proof and 100% <br/>
safe, but that's part of the problem with our society, some people expect that anything someone else tells them will <br/>
be 100% safe and they don't need to do any research. (Not that this applies to any person currently a member or any <br/>
future members of this mailing list in any way at all!!!  (grin))<br/>
<br/>
Remember, the toner that some of us use is environmentally unfriendly, nor is Acetone, the Exacto knives and other <br/>
various carving implements are sharp and dangerous, Poison Ivy (The plant, not the letterboxer!) abounds along with a <br/>
host of other poisonous plants and critters as well.<br/>
<br/>
Doing any hobby takes common sense.  Find what works for you, use common sense and be careful, research any chemicals <br/>
you may want to use, weigh the risks vs the benefits, become informed and make wise decisions based on facts and <br/>
figures, not on what someone who knew someone's brother who's friend's aunt's brothers' uncle told them! (If you <br/>
followed that, then you're better then me and I wrote it! (LOL!!)<br/>
<br/>
You can't wander through life as if you were wrapped in bubble wrap, released from having to make informed decisions, <br/>
completely safe from all harm.  Ok, you can, but if you do, in my opinion, you deserve what happens to you. (soft <br/>
smiles)<br/>

Ok folks. Xylene is a toxic chemical. Do I need to get out the MSDS sheets for 'yall <br/>
or will ya just give it a rest...?<br/>
<br/>
Citrasolve is just as effective and NOT TOXIC on the brain cells. Trust me, and a <br/>
good 'ol fashioned iron (heat transfer) works just fine too.<br/>
