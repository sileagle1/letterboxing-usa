<br/>
Hikers &amp; Hounds will be camping near Lake Arrowhead in the Endless Mountains area of the Poconos this memorial day weekend with our caving buddies. Does anyone know of any boxes within about an hours drive? It would be nice to squeeze three hobbies into one weekend, camping, caving, boxing. Thanks!<br/>

I cam concur about the West Park one being unavailable.  They are <br/>
painting and maintaining a small building right by it and plopped all <br/>
of the construction and destruction implements on the spot where the <br/>
box apparently is.  My son and I unsuccessfully tried to find it <br/>
before setting out to plant the Rodale Fitness Park box in <br/>
Trexlertown, PA.<br/>
<br/>
Lock Ridge Park in Aburtis also appears to be missing.  The 'big <br/>
black rock' has a perfect hiding spot, but alas there was nothing to <br/>
be found.<br/>

It's looks like it's a little over an hours drive from where I'll be so they appear to be highly "do-able". Not sure about the 3.25 mile hike and "lot's of steps" but we'll see. I tend to suffer from unbridled optimism, until harsh reality kicks me in the butt and reminds me that I am a 45 year old, incredibly overweight and out of shape woman. But you never know 'til you try, right? As one of my all time favorite 70's bands once sang "You can make it if you try". Anyone know who that was?<br/>

Where is Lake Arrowhead?  I can't find it on my map. I'm also headed <br/>
to the PA Endless Mountains in the near future.<br/>
 But closer to Wilkes-Barre.   Did you get any good leads to any <br/>
nearby boxes?? The Allentown/ Bethlehem areas are a little further <br/>

the "listed" boxes.:) Any scoop folks?<br/>

The closest boxes are probably Allentown if you're coming from the <br/>
south. Silent Doug has got some north of there in Scranton. In fact <br/>
he's got some NW and SE of W-B if my bearings are correct. Other <br/>
boxes are farther away from there unless you pass them on the way. I <br/>
don't know your launch point.<br/>
