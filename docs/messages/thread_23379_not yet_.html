them away. i pulled white sands before it got flooded, but B is for <br/>
Billy didn't fair so much. it has some water damage and it also had a <br/>
hitchhiker with it which is damaged too! 3 other boxes are fine and i <br/>
did find 1 box, in a tree in the middle of a large stream. when the <br/>
stream chills, i'll see if i can get it. i have posted on my wtaer <br/>
prone boxes a warning of unconfirmed location of boxes. so i have <br/>
about 8-9 boxes i still have to check up on, but i feel good that all <br/>
will be in place.<br/>

glad to go out looking with you sometime. how knows, it might still be <br/>
