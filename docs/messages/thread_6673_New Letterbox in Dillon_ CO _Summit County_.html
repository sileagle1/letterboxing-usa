<br/>
Location: Dillon, CO (Summit County)<br/>
Time: 1-2 Hours (depending on how fast you hike)<br/>
Distance: 1.25 miles<br/>
Elevation Gain: 520 feet<br/>
High Point: 9,800 feet<br/>
Rating: Easy-moderate<br/>
Usually open: June-September <br/>
<br/>
Driving on I-70, take the Silverthorne Exit 205, go East on U.S. Hwy.<br/>
6 (towards Keystone Mountain) to the 4th stoplight (Evergreen Road). <br/>
Turn left on Evergreen Road toward the Lutheran Church, then take an<br/>
immediate right on the eastbound roadway parallel to U.S. 6.  Travel<br/>
0.5 miles on this road past the U.S. Forest Service compound.  Proceed<br/>
onto the dirt road toward the Dillon water tank and designated trail<br/>
parking on a side hill below the tank.  Do not block water facility<br/>
access.  A dirt road above the water tank over the hill leads past the<br/>
administration building 0.25 miles to the trailhead.  The trail begins<br/>
near a wire fence with a gate to the uphill footpath.  <br/>
<br/>
When you reach the SECOND bench take a break, you?re very close now!!<br/>
 This location provides vistas west to the soaring Gore Range, across<br/>
the reservoir southwest to 12,800-foot Peak One, then down the Ten<br/>
Mile Range to the Breckenridge ski area and southeast beyond Summit<br/>
Cove toward the Continental Divide.<br/>
<br/>
After your break, facing uphill, stand at the right end of the bench.<br/>
 Take about 25 paces straight uphill towards two pine trees that are<br/>
about 4 feet apart.  Behind the tree on the right, under a pile of<br/>
rocks, you will find our treasure.  After stamping, please be sure and<br/>
recover the box securely as this area is covered in snow from October<br/>
- May.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
