                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am confronted with a delicate question -- could I get some opinions?<br/>
<br/>
I did not go letterboxing today... actually I decided to go running. But in a Forest Preserve <br/>
and on a trail I learned about when searching for a letterbox. Anyway, I just decided along <br/>
to the way to check on the letterbox, for no particular reason.<br/>
<br/>
Okay so, there is really no delicate way I know of to convey this. Um. Some human being <br/>
had used the end of the hollow log where the letterbox was hidden as their toilet and had <br/>
left a giant... well. The huge hollow log is perpendicular to the trail and as I got to that end <br/>
I was wondering what all the white was I was seeing scattered int he leaves was [my brain <br/>
was mainly occupied with a huge stitch in my side so my brain wasn't all that nimble at the <br/>
moment]. As I got closer I realized it was paper towels that had been used for wiping... <br/>
someone's posterior... and left scattered there. And I was so busy trying to compute what <br/>
the heck I was seeing that I did not notice where I was stepping and of course now I have <br/>
THAT all over my shoes.<br/>
<br/>
What really irks me is that I had recently decided to take up running again,a nd had gone <br/>
to a MALL on today of all days and bought these shoes and i think I had owned them for <br/>
all of 45 minutes and worn them for perhaps 20. I did have some handwipes in my car, in <br/>
my letterboxing bag, and I also have now scrubbed the treads as well as I can, but I feel <br/>
like i can still smell it. Ewww. But that's my own personal irritation, not really letterbox <br/>
related. Just an "EW!" and "I am ticked!!!" moment I am having.<br/>
<br/>
ANYWAY... so, do I tell the placer that there is this disgusting stench right where her box <br/>
is hidden? Or do I assume that most letterboxers, not huffing and puffing at their first run <br/>
[really, it was a jog] in almost a year will notice things better than I did and be more <br/>
careful?<br/>
<br/>
The box was fine by the way, I looked and took it all out, all dry and still hidden. Is it like, <br/>
"let the letterboxer beware" in this case?<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning up the site myself was just not an option. I did kick the paper towels away from <br/>
the opening of the hollow log but... then I got IT on the top of my new shoes as well.<br/>
<br/>
[On the plus side, running gives you such an endorphin high I find myself wanting to laugh <br/>
at my mishap as well as throttle whoever letft THAT behind. Instead of JUST the throttle <br/>
urge alone.]<br/>
<br/>
So... would anyone more experienced care to chime in on if I should suggest to the placer <br/>
to move her box? Or just leave it alone, since the box itself is ok. I mean, if someone was <br/>
sitting there doing whatever for that long and they didn't notice it... I guess it's a great <br/>
hiding spot.<br/>

I would bleach your shoe soles (10min, 10% bleach in water, allow it dry<br/>
on).<br/>

If "it" is very near the box, this does present a potential biohazard, as<br/>
Hep virus can live outside the body for WEEKS.<br/>

It was only about a couple of feet away from the cache. Poor kid, she was really grossed out and cried. We were fortunate to have a lake nearby so she could wash up.<br/>

We mentioned it in the online logs so as to warn others to be on the lookout.<br/>

I would contact the owner and hopefully they will post something in the clue page. I know I would want to be forewarned.<br/>
