I found the box still in the hollow log where it had been planted, but the log had washed into the middle of a field and the box was exposed! It was also full of water, but luckily the last folks who found the box before the flood had sealed the baggies well so the logbook and stamp were in perfect condition! (Thanks mater et regisfilia!) Anyway, if you've printed out these clues before today, you will need to print out the clues for the new location.<br/>
Thanks, Puddle Splasher<br/>
