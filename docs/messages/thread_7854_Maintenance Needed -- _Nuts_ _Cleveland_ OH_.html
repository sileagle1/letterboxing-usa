BayBoxer's "Nuts" (aka Black Walnut) letterbox. Great Stamp!!!  But <br/>
sad to say, the box has been discovered by pranksters -- the log book <br/>
was missing, although it appeared the used pages had been torn out <br/>
and left in the box (but not sure it was all of them, as this box has <br/>
been around for a year and a half and there were only a few loose <br/>
pages in the box). There were also some unkind words scribbled onto <br/>
one of the loose pages from the log book. This is unfortunate as I <br/>
concluded from the comments previous finders had made, it was a very <br/>
nice handmade book.<br/>
<br/>
I had used my spare log book in DE the day before to place a box I <br/>
had not planned on, so I didn't have anything with me to leave <br/>
behind. I put the box back into the same spot, but hid it a little <br/>
better.<br/>
