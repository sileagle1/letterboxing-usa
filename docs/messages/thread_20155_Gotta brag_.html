I had carved a cat stamp but it was more like a cartoon. <br/>

So I took a picture of my kitty cat, changed it to black and white and transferred it to the PZKut. And....It looks great! My boys each knew it was our cat (so that's gotta mean something!) hehehe<br/>

I'm feeling so proud of myself! ;) Usually my stamps are simple (which is my style and that's fine with me!) but this one is much more intricate! Woohoo!!<br/>
<br/>
Just had to brag a little bit! I don't have a scanner so I can't upload a picture but if you see me on the trails (I'll be the one patting myself on the back!) you can ask me about my lovely kitty cat and obtain the stamp! <br/>
