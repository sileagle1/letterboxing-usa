<br/>
Directions to Start:<br/>
Moro Canyon is part of Crystal Cove State Park, on Highway 1 <br/>
(8471 Pacific Coast Highway) Between Corona Del Mar and <br/>
Laguna Beach. It is approximately 2 miles North of Laguna <br/>
Beach on the East side of the Highway. The parking lot is located <br/>
behind an elementary school and a mobile home park.  There is <br/>
a $5 parking fee. Pay at the vending machine (only takes exact <br/>
change) or pay in the Ranger Headquarters.<br/>
Make sure to pick up a map.<br/>
<br/>
On To the Hunt!<br/>
Start by taking the El Moro Canyon Cutoff trail. This starts at the <br/>
bottom of the parking lot (where you came in) to the left as you <br/>
face the ocean. This trail follows the fenceline above a trailer <br/>
park and joins the El Moro Canyon Rd. Follow this road until you <br/>
reach another trail coming in from your right. This is the South <br/>
Connector Trail (also known as "B.F.I."). You will come down this <br/>
trail later. Continue on until you intersect with the East <br/>
Cut-Across Rd. (also known as "I-Think-I-Can"). on your right. <br/>
Take this trail and climb to just below the top of the hill (~ 1.1 <br/>
miles), taking the right branch of the road and continue right <br/>
when you reach the El Moro Ridge Rd. Follow the El Moro Ridge <br/>
Rd.  past the power lines and dead end road to a junction with <br/>
the B.F.I Trail. Take the trail that bears Southwest (back towards <br/>
the ocean) ,following the fence-line until you find a "steel <br/>
saguaro". There is a plaque near by. From the bottom of thehill, <br/>
in front of  the plaque, take 33 steps back along the trail you just <br/>
came in on, past the steel saguaro. Turn and take 4 steps 115 <br/>
(from true North) and you will find the letterbox under a rock. <br/>
Please replace the box so that it is well hidden. To get back to <br/>
the trailhead, return to the Y junction and follow  the B.F.I. Trail <br/>
towards the ocean, enjoing the views. Just past where you meet <br/>
the homes, look for a trail on the right with a sign for El Moro <br/>
Ridge / Ranger Station. (.8 miles) and follow it down to the El <br/>
Moro Canyon Road. Turn left and retrace your steps to your car.<br/>
