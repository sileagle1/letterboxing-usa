                    <html><body>I sent an e-mail a couple of days ago concerning the Indian and the WF letterboxes and how they needed updating.  Since no one has spoken up concerning the ownership of those boxes, then perhaps I should take over, since I drive through Norwich a lot to go to the beach house in Quonnie RI.  
<br/>
<br/>I'm thinking about replacing box #2, but I don't know what the subject was of the box.  Does anyone have a stamp from box #2 that would be willing to tell me what the stamp is of?
<br/>
<br/>I'll try and get down there on Thursday evening to plant the box and replace logbooks.  However, I do not want to step on anyone's toes, so speak up if this is taboo!
<br/>
<br/>See ya!

Pam, <br/>
   The stamp is a Native American head in profile, with full feather <br/>
headdress.  It appeared store-bought.  The narrative (we think), was <br/>
something like:  "Where do you want to have the party, Olivia(not <br/>
sure of name)?"  "Remember the park with the Indian &amp; the Water <br/>
Fountain?  We can have it there."<br/>
 And momma said allright.<br/>
     Patrick went &amp; checked the location where we found it <br/>
previously, and also found it missing.  They have done alot of park <br/>
cleanup in that area, and it probably got caught in that.  We don't <br/>
know who the owner of the boxes are, and don't know the ediquette of <br/>
the situation either.  But it is a fun little series that we really <br/>
enjoyed.  We live in Norwich and have another box of our own in the <br/>
park.  We wouldn't mind upkeeping them also, but again, don't want to <br/>
overstep.  Don't know what to tell you there.  Sorry!<br/>
