never been. We were able to find 9 boxes and have an exchange with <br/>
Mr.Teddy and his pretty friend Lydia. It was their first time out and <br/>
she had never heard about this addicting "sport" before yesterday. So <br/>
Teddy welcome to Letterboxing and hope to see you on the trails!<br/>
  Two things happened today. The first and probably the only time in <br/>
my life that a civil war military dude told us to leave because they <br/>
were going to shoot a canon towards us. I asked him when was the <br/>
firing commencing? He said in 15 minutes and I told him I would be <br/>
out of firing range by then. (I was determined to get that box!) He <br/>
then sent someone higher up in rank to shoo us away. We left, but <br/>
returned eventually find the treasure.<br/>
  After finding the Washington Monument Box we where looking for a <br/>
discreet place to stamp. I saw a nice spot farther down the trail and <br/>
off the path. Looking down at the ground so not to step in the <br/>
infamous poison ivy, I saw something move. It was about 18 inches <br/>
long, rusty orange colored with brown markings. "SNAKE",I screamed.  <br/>
Poor Turtle went bolting out of the woods back to the trail. We <br/>
decided to forget being discreet, so we sat down in the middle of the <br/>
trail to do our stampng. And nobody saw us! Turtle said that was <br/>
enough for today! <br/>
  Since a snake is a reptile and lizards are reptiles I'm adding to <br/>
my lizard count.<br/>
  Does anyone out there know what kind of snake we encountered? <br/>
  Also, driving out of the park were 2 baby deer standing in the <br/>
middle of the road. I was able to creep right up to them with the <br/>
car. And they were looking at the car the whole time! Then they <br/>
bolted into the woods. What a great day! The end.<br/>
