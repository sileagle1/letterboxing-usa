We had gotten a couple emails suggesting that it was MIA.  We checked tonight and it is still there and getting quite a lot of visitors.  Thanks for all the nice messages.  <br/>
<br/>
We changed the directions a little because as one visitor noted there are two possible right turns onto River Street.  If someone goes in the wrong (other) entrance then they search the wrong side of the bridge.  <br/>
