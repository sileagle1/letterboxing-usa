I've kept the secret this long (except a select few people who <br/>
carved and planted with me)!!!<br/>
<br/>
Announcing the new letterbox series "Avery Tract" located in the <br/>
Quaker Hill section of Waterford, CT.  Its 8 boxes, 3 miles, give it <br/>
2-3 hours to hike and stamp everything. The land is owned by West <br/>
Farms Land Trust and I have been working with their board member <br/>
John Bodin (Bee Keeper on the trails) to plant all these boxes. <br/>
<br/>
John has had many volunteers working to clear and blaze the trails. <br/>
As of now they are well cleared and most are marked. Some of the <br/>
trails this voyage takes you on are NOT marked, but we feel they are <br/>
adequately cleared and the detail to the clues is sufficient to get <br/>
everyone through the loop!  There are a few spots that you will back <br/>
track through to continue the hike, but overall it is a nice loop <br/>
trail.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!!!!<br/>

Patrick and Amy, Butterfly, and the Drews) <br/>
