                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wondering if anyone has found this box recently or can verify the <br/>
status.  We tried to find it today, and as the clues were quite <br/>
specific, am sure we were at the right place.  We truly looked like <br/>
sandcrabs, digging the sand away from the entire front and right side <br/>
of the wooden porch/gazebo structure, but there was no box there.  <br/>
Being that this location is at the mercy of the weather and I am sure <br/>
blowing sand could easily cover it during a strong wind, we dug <br/>
pretty deep and reached under as far as our arms could go, but still <br/>
no box to be found.<br/>
<br/>
Also wondering about the location of this box -- it is nearly <br/>
impossible to be discreet here.  Even though it was a Monday in <br/>
September, there were quite a few people around, sitting in the porch <br/>
thing and on the beach.  A few even asked us if we had lost something <br/>
while we were digging in the sand around the structure.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, we easily found the 2 Jersey Shore Tracks boxes and <br/>
enjoyed our trip to Long Beach Island and Barnegat Lighthouse.  <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
