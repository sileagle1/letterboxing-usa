called "I love ice cream!".  For those of you living under rocks <br/>
(grin), Judi and Linton left a few weeks ago to return to their <br/>
native land of New Zealand. As a last favor from us, Judi asked me to <br/>
plant this box at Salem Valley Farms in Salem, CT. <br/>
<br/>
The store is in its last week of business before the winter shut-<br/>
down. You'll be able to get the box over the winter but we HIGHLY <br/>
suggest either waiting for spring OR stopping back for some tasty <br/>
treats once the leaves turn green again.<br/>
<br/>
There's probably 75 boxes within a 15 minute car ride so this makes <br/>
for a lovely stop over when collecting stamps from Walden Pond, <br/>
Hartman Park, Devil's Hopyard, etc etc etc in the summer!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!!!!<br/>
