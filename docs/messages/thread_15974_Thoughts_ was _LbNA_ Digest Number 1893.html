Let me say something on this point....  The things that I have written<br/>
about, as far as Geocachers go, is not meant in anyway to be indicative of<br/>
ALL geocachers. Not by a long shot. Haw can it be when it only describes 2<br/>
sets of geocachers in two separate stories?  No, they were meant to show the<br/>
values that our society has come to embrace, as a whole, in my opinion.<br/>
That's all.<br/>
<br/>
Let me make this perfectly clear here. I am not stepping on Geocachers as a<br/>
whole, because I am sure that some Letterboxers do the same things.  I was<br/>
merely using a label, much like the magazine Highlights does, using Jetsam<br/>
and Flotsam, between good and bad aspects of something similar, Letterboxing<br/>
and Geocaching.<br/>
<br/>
Don't mean to get anyone riled by my posts at all.<br/>

&gt; I am sorry you met with geocachers that were so bad. and I'm sorry that<br/>
&gt; letterboxers left cigarettes in a letterbox. I am sure there are good and<br/>
&gt; bad in both hobbies.!<br/>
&gt; I geocache. I take our trash I don't smoke. I letterbox.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If this degenerates into a geocaching bash I'll be deleteing messages UFN.<br/>
