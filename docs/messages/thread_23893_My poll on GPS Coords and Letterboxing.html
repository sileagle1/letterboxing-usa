I don't care either way, as long as I don't need a <br/>

I don't like it at all. The GPS should stay with the <br/>

I posted a new one in my sidebar that polls hybrid boxes.<br/>
<br/>
While I do both hobbies I do not like the idea of hybrid boxes. I <br/>
think that they will only confuse the matter.<br/>
<br/>
My blog where the poll is.<br/>

Hmm. This makes me want to plant a letterbox with just GPS <br/>
coordinates just to be annoying. :P<br/>

Thanks for the opportunity to talk about hybrids, i.e. letterboxes on<br/>
geocaching.com.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite letterbox hybrid mirrors the traditional letterbox - a box<br/>
with a logbook and a rubberstamp. <br/>
<br/>
Hybrids can also be - a logbook, rubberstamp and trinkets for trading.<br/>
And I think that's what people think of when they hear the term<br/>
"letterbox hybrid". I haven't seen any of these in my area and none of<br/>
the letterboxes that I have on geocaching.com contain trinkets. I<br/>
think trinkets mixed in with the rubberstamp confuses things and<br/>
increases the chance that the stamp could be traded out. <br/>
<br/>
I note in my clues not to trade out the stamp then I put a "No<br/>
trinkets please. Do not trade out the stamp" note in the box and<br/>
finally, for added security, I use<br/>
a fine point sharpie marker to add a note to the back of the stamp "Do<br/>
not trade out. Leave in the box" and if there's room I include my<br/>
email address. In almost 4 years of planting hybrids I had one<br/>
stamp traded out and I'm pretty sure it was because I didn't leave a<br/>
note in the box and I didn't write anything on the back of the stamp.<br/>
BTW the stamp was personally delivered back to me by the geocacher<br/>
after I contacted him.<br/>
<br/>
There are variations when it comes to the use of the GPS units. Some<br/>
take the finder to a parking lot or trailhead with directions from<br/>
there to the letterbox. This type of box can potentially be done<br/>
without a GPS unit. Then there are boxes that take a person to a spot<br/>
on the trail with directions to the nearby box. And some coords take<br/>
people right to the box. The nice thing is that hiders have a variety<br/>
of methods to choose from when posting a letterbox on gc.com but you<br/>
must use coordinates in order to post on the site.<br/>

hiding place, what do you think? But I did one thing,<br/>
reseached the idea in the archives. Letterboxers were<br/>
toying with this idea before geocaching became what it<br/>
did. Do I see this kind of box as a future trend, no.<br/>
But flexibility and creativity seem to be a<br/>
letterboxing norm, and I had a little fun.<br/>
