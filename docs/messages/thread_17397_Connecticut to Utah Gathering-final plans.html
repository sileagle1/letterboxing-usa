                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is it!  I'm excited to finally announce final plans for the gathering<br/>
in Salt Lake City.  We had to make some last minute rearrangements as 2-3<br/>
feet of snow have fallen in less than a week.  The gathering is now<br/>
officially going to be indoors, so hopefully that will entice some that may<br/>
have been more reticent because of weather.  Also, as much as we need the<br/>
moisture, I'm doing some non-rain dances hoping the skies will permit others<br/>
to travel in.  I know that at least two or three of us are having to go over<br/>
mountain ranges to make it there, so please be careful (but please come<br/>
still :) <br/>
<br/>
We can't wait to see everyone and have a great exchange/stamping session<br/>
such as never has been seen in these parts.  I know it will seen small to<br/>
those with more boxers around, but we've had more response to this than any<br/>
previous efforts to meet.  I may be wrong, but I believe this is the first<br/>
gathering ever in Utah.  That is pretty fun!<br/>
<br/>
Connecticut to Utah Gathering<br/>
Date: Sat. January 3 (this weekend)<br/>
Time: beginning 11:00-we'll see where it goes from there<br/>
Place: The Old Spaghetti Factory (at Trolley Square)<br/>
Instructions:  Trolley Square is very easy to find.  It is at 600 South 700<br/>
East in downtown Salt Lake City.  If you are coming from I-15, you get off<br/>
on the 600 S exit (the main downtown exit) and stay on that same road as it<br/>
heads towards the mountains.  Before it gets there, it will turn into a<br/>
one-way road; continue to follow it.  Parking is best in the lot on the west<br/>
side of Trolley Square.  Go in and you will see the restauraunt up the<br/>
stairs.  I will ask for a table under the name, "The Letterboxers."<br/>
<br/>
We will likely stay at the Spaghetti Factory for a while, but we are<br/>
planning to try to get out and at least plant some of the letterboxes<br/>
Butterfly is bringing from our faithful cohorts back east.  We'll see what<br/>
the snow allows.  A friend of mine has also said she could probably take us<br/>
for a carriage ride if we are there in the evening. I hope to see everyone<br/>
there!<br/>
<br/>
Until then,<br/>
Cadenza<br/>

ps.  This email is being posted to the main list and Rocky Mtn list, and I<br/>
put the details on the calendar for the main list too.<br/>
