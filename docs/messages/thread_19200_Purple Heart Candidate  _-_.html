Purple Heart. :-(<br/>
<br/>
This past weekend I traveled to my hometown in Indiana for a big<br/>
family reunion. We had the opportunity to teach a bunch of them how<br/>
to carve their own stamps and had a great time introducing my family<br/>
to the hobby. On Sunday afternoon several adults and a whole buncha<br/>
kids wanted to go hunt a box. There's one pretty close to my<br/>
mother's house with a really easy hike and I thought that the<br/>
perfect 'first box'.<br/>
<br/>
While there, we discovered a tree down over the path. Leading the<br/>
way with joy, I popped over the tree explaining to the kids all<br/>
about the stuff around them. When I jumped down on the other side,<br/>
my right foot slipped and twisted to the side. :-(<br/>
<br/>
I walked out, being stoic and figuring it was just sprained. I<br/>
didn't want to ruin their first letterboxing experience--- YES, we<br/>
found the box. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Later that evening it continued to get worse. Being a firefighter<br/>
and first responder, I had to admit finally that something was bad<br/>
wrong. I spent all day at the doctor yesterday to find out from the<br/>
orthopedist that I've dislocated several bones in my right foot and<br/>
probably fractured at least one.<br/>
<br/>
So! I'm 16 and a half hours from home, without anyone to help me<br/>
drive. The doctors are hopeful that the appliance I'm wearing on my<br/>
foot will help re'allign the bones in that foot so I can make it<br/>
home without having to pay for a plane ticket for someone.<br/>
Regardless I have to report to the doctors in SC for long-term care<br/>
and re-evaluation of that possible fractured bone. Even if I manage<br/>
to heal enough to drive I probably won't be able to do much<br/>
letterboxing on the way home. That hurts worse than my foot! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Whatcha think guys? Does a broken foot while teaching children the<br/>
joys of letterboxing qualify for the coveted Order of the Purple<br/>
Heart stamp???<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, GreyCrazy!  If you get back to me quick, there's a chance I may be able to find a ride for you, depending when you wanted to leave.  Email me at annalisa@fast.net if you want to try it.  My relatives are also in Indiana (they were around Muncy but I think are headed for Goshen, near Elkhart) and are headed back to Asheville, NC soon.  Maybe leaving Indiana Saturday-ish &amp; taking a brief stop--don't know for sure?  There are buses back to SC from Asheville.  Well, it may be a long shot, but I thought I'd let you know.  They are very helpful and friendly, sociable people and would help you out in a minute if it would work.  I'll check email again late tonight and also a few times in AM.  Good luck!    -lunaryakketyact<br/>
