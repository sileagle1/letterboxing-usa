Alright folks.  <br/>
<br/>
Bible, Darwinism, responsibility to society, etc, is beginning to <br/>
drift a bit off-topic.  I feel as strongly about these issues as <br/>
the next fellow and would love to debate them off-list, but their <br/>
relationship to letterboxing is becoming tangential at best.<br/>
<br/>
I don't care if the debate keeps going, (although it has the signature<br/>
of a holy war in and of itself and this might be a good time for it to<br/>
die as well), but lets keep the scripture quoting and Darwinistic <br/>
views to a minimum.  This list is the wrong forum for that debate to<br/>
erupt. <br/>

I'm confused... are your remarks a warning that we need to protect ourselves<br/>
from lawyers, or simply to make it all so easy that no one fails, or has to<br/>
work at letterboxing????<br/>

<br/>
 If a woman burns her thighs on the hot coffee she was holding in her lap<br/>
 while driving, she blames the restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
 If your teen-age son kills himself, you blame the rock 'n' roll music or<br/>
 musician he liked.<br/>
<br/>
 If you smoke three packs a day for 40 years and die of lung cancer, your<br/>
 family blames the tobacco company.<br/>
<br/>
 If your daughter gets pregnant by the football captain, you blame the<br/>
 school  for poor sex education.<br/>
<br/>
 If your neighbor crashes into a tree while driving home drunk, you blame<br/>
 the  bartender.<br/>
<br/>
 If your cousin gets AIDS because the needle he used to shoot up with<br/>
 heroin  was dirty, you blame the government for not providing clean ones.<br/>
<br/>
 If your grandchildren are brats without manners, you blame television.<br/>
<br/>
 If your friend is shot by a deranged madman, you blame the gun<br/>
 manufacturer.<br/>
<br/>
 And if a crazed person breaks into the cockpit and tries to kill the<br/>
 pilots  at 35,000 feet, and the passengers kill him instead, the<br/>
mother of the deceased blames the airline.<br/>

I would appreciate it if you wouldn't turn my words around to try and make <br/>
it look like I'm saying something I'm not. This isn't some political <br/>
discussion board after all. Sir, you have grossly over reacted to something <br/>
that your own admitted stupidity caused. Now you want to put the fear of <br/>
lawsuits where previously it has never been. And when you are taken to task <br/>
for your over reaction, you then start turning people's words around to <br/>
make them look bad. You have crossed the line. I was only saying that when <br/>
there is no longer any personal responsibility we have failed as a people. <br/>
You want compassion for your fellow man, I'm your man. You don't know me <br/>
from a whole in the wall and I would appreciate you not getting personal <br/>
anymore. Thank you.<br/>
