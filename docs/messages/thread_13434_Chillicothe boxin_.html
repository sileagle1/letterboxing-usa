Chillicothe, Ohio boxes yesterday evening.  We found "Grand View" <br/>
and "Little Peeper, Petite" to be dry and in good condition.  We did <br/>
have to search for a bit for the "Little Peeper" - teaches us to read <br/>
and follow the clues carefully and not jump to conclusions.  A good <br/>
hide.  We suspect things have leafed out since "Grand View" was <br/>
hidden.  If we hadn't known what we should be seeing we might not <br/>
have found it.  it also doubles as a geocache - first one of those <br/>
we've encountered.  Surprised to find such a BIG box after all those <br/>
microboxes!  Nice relaxing Sat. evening!  What a great hobby!<br/>

Scoutdog and I had a little trouble finding <br/>
the " Little Peeper " also.But after we realized the correct starting<br/>
point we stumbled upon the box .<br/>
Fun little find it was ! We were laughing pretty hard at that one .<br/>
<br/>
Hope you and your crew can visit here (Cincy) next weekend ( June 15 )<br/>
