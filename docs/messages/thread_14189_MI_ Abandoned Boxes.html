SpringChick's got the rest of the state covered.  Here's what's left in Eastern Michigan:<br/>
<br/>
Brighton:<br/>

Secret Garden- Presumed MISSING<br/>
<br/>
I live in Detroit, so Clarkston is a bit of a hike for me, but I can make it up there once in a while.  HOWEVER, (and this is totally embarassing) I've been there twice and could only find "This Place Rocks" and "49 Habitat Trail".  "Indpendent Oak" completely stumped me.  So much so I never even attempted "Dragonflies" or "Ladies".  I'd be more than happy to maintain them, if I could find them *doh*  So if you've been there and can direct pokey old me to "Independent Oak", I'm all for taking on the box.  *grin*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for "Snowflake" and "Secret Garden" no one's been able to find them at all- not even people who've been successful in the past.  In one case, a whole landmark was wiped out in a storm- it seems that they are MIA.<br/>
<br/>
If there's anyone closer to Clarkston who'd like to take the boxes, great.  If not, I'll be more than happy to.<br/>

<br/>
I can take the eastern side boxes, as I know most of them fairly well. The<br/>
UP though, is a bit out of my zone to adopt...LOL, especially with the baby<br/>
due in October.<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, the boxes in question are:<br/>
<br/>
Oakland County<br/>
<br/>
Secret Garden  1 Royal Oak, MI  Oakland     ( this one has been missing for<br/>
sometime and should be deleted)<br/>
<br/>
This Place Rocks  1 Clarkston, MI  Oakland<br/>
49 Habitat Trail  1 Clarkston, MI  Oakland<br/>
Dragonflies Are Free  1 Clarkston, MI  Oakland<br/>
Independent Oak  1 Clarkston, MI  Oakland<br/>
Ladies of the Lake<br/>
(These were all placed by edugaytor originally. I'm not sure what happened<br/>
to him, but I will try and contact him.)<br/>
<br/>
Livingston County<br/>
<br/>
Snowflake  1 Brighton, MI  Livingston  (another confirmed missing box that<br/>
should be deleted for now)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If we deleted the two known MIAs, then the only thing left would be to find<br/>
out about Edugaytor's boxes and if he is still interested. I can volunteer<br/>
for this since I have been to all of them.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>

Thanks for offering! I live closer to Clarkston, so the drive wouldn't be<br/>
that bad for me. I have been to all of them ( hints may be possible...LOL),<br/>
so maintenance would be not that hard.<br/>

We'd be happy to help out by adopting some boxes as well.  Top o' the <br/>
Pickle and Mighty Mac are ones we pass by at minimum 4 times per <br/>
year, so if SpringChick wants to pass them off to us we'd be more <br/>
than willing. <br/>
<br/>
We've also recently planted one of our own near Iron Mountain, and <br/>
can look into adopting the 3 in that area.  I'll see if I can track <br/>
down the original owners to see what their situation is.  Two of <br/>
those three, however, have been reported "not found" by several <br/>
people -- ourselves included on one of them. (Didn't try for the <br/>
other, since it was too hot to go looking for a 'probably not there' <br/>
box with our two antsy nephews!)  We did find the other, though, and <br/>
can check on it periodically easily enough.<br/>

That was the same experience I had a couple weeks ago.  I found Fumee Lake<br/>
box, but not Fumee Creek or Piers Gorge.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I just tried to find the three Iron Mountain boxes you<br/>
&gt; are speaking of.  The only one I found was the second<br/>
&gt; one - Fumee Lake Natural Area.  I firmly believe the<br/>
&gt; other two are MIA.<br/>

&gt; &gt; We'd be happy to help out by adopting some boxes as<br/>
&gt; &gt; well.  Top o' the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Pickle and Mighty Mac are ones we pass by at minimum<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4 times per <br/>
&gt; &gt; year, so if SpringChick wants to pass them off to us<br/>
&gt; &gt; we'd be more <br/>
&gt; &gt; than willing. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We've also recently planted one of our own near Iron<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mountain, and <br/>
&gt; &gt; can look into adopting the 3 in that area.  I'll see<br/>
&gt; &gt; if I can track <br/>
&gt; &gt; down the original owners to see what their situation<br/>
&gt; &gt; is.  Two of <br/>
&gt; &gt; those three, however, have been reported "not found"<br/>
&gt; &gt; by several <br/>
&gt; &gt; people -- ourselves included on one of them. (Didn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; try for the <br/>
&gt; &gt; other, since it was too hot to go looking for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; 'probably not there' <br/>
&gt; &gt; box with our two antsy nephews!)  We did find the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other, though, and <br/>
&gt; &gt; can check on it periodically easily enough.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Muskegon Beach Box<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Cairn Highway<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Old Mission Peninsula<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Placed by the Shorewood Folks:<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Mt. Baldy Jr.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Birthday<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   First Letterbox on the Lake<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Beach View by the Dunes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This leaves a few boxes in eastern MI and a couple<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the U.P.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps there is somebody else that would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; willing to follow-up <br/>
&gt; &gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; these?<br/>
