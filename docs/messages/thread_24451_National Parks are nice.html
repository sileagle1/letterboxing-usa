This is a responce to the "why can't they be nicer?" series of posts.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that National Parks have gone out of their way to be nice to <br/>
letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
I'm probably stating common knowledge here but every national park <br/>
already has its own letterbox stamp.<br/>
Here's what they offer:<br/>
*It officially endorsed, they want you to do it.<br/>
*They even offer you a personal log book if you don't have one.<br/>
*Its personalized to the individual national park.<br/>
*Different regions are in different colors.<br/>
*Its unique to the specfic day you go.<br/>
<br/>
Now what I'm talking about is the National Park Passport Stamps.<br/>
Here's a link to wikipedia about them<br/>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Passport_Stamps<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to a specific park<br/>
http://www.nps.gov/bibe/planyourvisit/passport_stamps.htm<br/>
<br/>
As you can see in the example above there really isn't any <br/>
difference between what a National park offers and many "park and <br/>
stamp" letterboxes.  The 'clues' to find the location might be <br/>
simple but I've done about a dozen regular letterboxes with <br/>
instructions that say something to the effect of "Park your car then <br/>
walk to the entrance sign.  Behind it is the box."<br/>
<br/>
We should also remember that the journey and the Stopping to Smell <br/>
the Flowers is as important as the ink impression.<br/>
<br/>
We as letterboxers simply need to recognize a "Passport Stamp" as a <br/>
letterbox stamp.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey, that's not a bad idea! :-) Sort of like the boxes that are in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; businesses where a letterboxer only has to give a particular<br/>
&gt; password<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; handed the box.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;before i even knew about LB<br/>
&gt; &gt; i was already collecting stamps using the National Parks PASSPORT<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; we got our first stamp at DEATH VALLEY 02MAY89 and have carried the<br/>
&gt; PASSPORT<br/>
&gt; &gt; with us when ever we travel<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; they are great!<br/>
&gt; &gt; and LEGAL!<br/>

I love going to our state parks.  So pretty and so full of history.  We<br/>
spent about 9.5 years in Charlotte and didn't spend near the time visiting<br/>
parks there.  We really missed it.  The CCC's built most of our parks.  My<br/>
father was in the CCC's and helped build Watoga State Park.  He talked a lot<br/>
about building the dam there.  Anyway, sorry to ramble.<br/>

That's neat.  I wonder if they'll put them up at the Hatfield-McCoy system<br/>
trailheads too? I was very impressed when I visited WV back in March. But<br/>
those aren't state parks, come to think of it, they're trails on<br/>
private/corporate land managed by a non-profit org. Perhaps I'll write to<br/>
them about it anyway.<br/>

&gt; WV.  We have a VIP Program here.  If you stamp using that card I<br/>
mentioned<br/>
&gt; and mail it in they will send you a park raincoat and another card.  <br/>
Each<br/>
&gt; card you fill after you get the raincoat earns you a star to sew<br/>
onto the<br/>
&gt; raincoat.  We are stamping the card but I don't think we will mail<br/>
them in.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks so much Mind Racer and Tammy- we have prepared a briefing paper for the bigwigs. Our current policy leaves it up to the rangers- who may like boxes, or may just remove them all. I am pushing to establish something along the lines of the examples you gave me, with rewards for finding boxes in a given number of parks. There is a lot of angst in the park world right now over attracting a new generation of visitors, and this sounds far better to me than the video game idea that is floating around out there (don't even ask...)<br/>
<br/>
  And, more importantly, if we sponsor our own boxes, somebody has to carve the stamps, right? And spend considerable time in the field, finding appropriate locations.... <br/>
<br/>
  thanks for the guidance, the citizens of California will thank you-<br/>
