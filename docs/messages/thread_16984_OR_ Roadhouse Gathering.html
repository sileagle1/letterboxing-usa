<br/>
Any outa towners who might be lucky enough to be visiting our <br/>
fabulous part of the country during the first week of December, <br/>
put this on your calendar. We are having a get-together 12/6 at <br/>
McMennamin's Roadhouse 4-6 PM in Hillsboro, OR. <br/>
<br/>
We will be meeting with Kyle Spinks from the Tualatin Parks and <br/>
Recreation Department to learn about letterboxing opportunities <br/>
in his jurisdicition. This will be the perfect time to meet some of <br/>
the local Lb afficionados, old and new. Brett Costley is creating <br/>
the event stamp...and remember, letterboxing is a FOUR season <br/>
pastime in the PNW. Just bring that raingear!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there, Funhog<br/>
