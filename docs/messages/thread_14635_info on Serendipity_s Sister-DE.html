I sent you an e-mail (off-list) after your original post.   Please <br/>
let me know if you didn't get it.<br/>

&gt; OK, <br/>
&gt; I did a Google search and came up with a web page on 'Govenors' at:<br/>
&gt; http://www.nga.org/governors/1,1169,C_GOVERNOR_INFO%5ED_462,00.html<br/>
&gt; here you will find a link on the left for past govenors and you can<br/>
&gt; then check each one to see who died in office.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then I did another Google search for 'tidal wave in the hurricane of<br/>
&gt; 1878' and came up with a website for the Delaware Geological <br/>
Survey. <br/>
&gt; Hope this helps!<br/>

You might like to know that this mystery is drivin' me nuts. LOL  But <br/>
I'm determined and I WILL find it. ;)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Lynda, welcome to letterboxing!  There is certainly nothing wrong <br/>
with asking for help, even on a mystery box.  Whether or not you will <br/>
get anything is another story.  I was just trying to point out that <br/>
when people want to discuss or help somebody out on a mystery box, it <br/>
should be done off-list.  A lot of people like to figure out the <br/>
mystery boxes and when the discussion is posted to the list, it can <br/>
be a spoiler for other people.<br/>
<br/>
I will resend the e-mail I sent you yesterday (I sent it to whatever <br/>
e-mail you used to sign up here).  Perhaps there will be some <br/>
additional help there for you.  Good luck!<br/>

Deb (SpringChick)<br/>
