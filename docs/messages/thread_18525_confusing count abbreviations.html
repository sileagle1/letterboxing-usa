I KNOW we're supposed to stay off the subject of "how to count",<br/>
according to the website, and I can understand those questions burned<br/>
everyone out long ago.  So, with fear and trepidation I must admit as a<br/>
newbie I understand most of the count abbreviations but simply can't<br/>
find info. or standard practice on the others. People definitely seem to<br/>
have their own ways of doing it. If there is a place to learn what<br/>
Dartmoor tradition &amp; US tradition is on this, I'd be glad to be directed<br/>
to it.  Dagonell the Pirate, there were a bunch of strange ones<br/>
abbreviations on your count-- and is there a difference between a<br/>
hitchhiker and a traveler?  So here's what I know, but there are a bunch<br/>
of different abbreviations I've seen on this list that are lost on me:<br/>
<br/>
P = Planted box<br/>
F = Found box<br/>
X = Exchanged stamps (at a gathering or by mail, I assume?)<br/>

last weekend.  The weather was perfect and I loved the boxes I found <br/>
Chilo Nature preserve. Seemed like I was right on Mad Dawg's trail but <br/>
never did catch up with them.  I must have stamped in right behind them <br/>

abbreviations... V is for Virtual isn't it? PLB is a Postal Letterbox.  <br/>
Curious what the rest are.  Could E be the same as X meaning exchanged?<br/>

I've learned so for in this engaging sport...<br/>
<br/>
P   - Planted (Any letterbox you have personally planted, wether normal or hitchhiker)<br/>
<br/>
F   - Found (Any letterbox that you have personally found. You could include Hitchhikers here, or count them in your <br/>
HH count.)<br/>
<br/>
A   - Adopted (Any letterbox that someone else has planted that you are now maintaining.  This one is fairly new and <br/>
is not a requirement that it is used, you could count hem under your P count if you choose to do so, but you didn't <br/>
really plant it did you?)<br/>
<br/>
E   - Events (Event stamps, stamps from events that you have personally attended.)<br/>
<br/>
X   - Exchanges (Other Letterboxers personal sig stamps that you have obtained by 'exchanging' stamps with them <br/>
personally)<br/>
<br/>
T   - Travellers (Any letterbox that has been turned into a traveller that someone carries around or sends to different <br/>
events<br/>
<br/>
HH  - Hitchhikers (Any letterbox that you find that is residing in another letterbox and is meant to move from box to <br/>
box.)<br/>
<br/>
PLB - Postal Letterboxes (Any letterbox that is sent via some form of mail, arriving at your home address, meant to <br/>
move to another on a list. Receiving a letterbox from someone to plant in you area does not qualify as a PLB, it would <br/>
be a plant for you.  Same for a Hitchhiker that someone sends to you to plant in your area.)<br/>
<br/>
V   - Virtual (Any 'letterbox' that exists solely in cyberspace, where searching the Internet for answers to clues and <br/>
receiving a digital image of a stamp for successfully solving the clues.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is a plethora of other acronyms that people may use such as 'SNL' = Snakes and Lizards Seen On The Trail, 'PL' = <br/>
Pounds Lost While Letterboxing, all of which are personal acronyms and everyone should feel free to use personal <br/>
acronyms as long as they remember one thing.... It will cause the repeated question 'What does [insert letter here] <br/>
stand for after your name?'<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>

Hey!  I told you I was a geek!  Actually, most people got them<br/>
already, but to recap (And you could probably figure them out from my<br/>
webpage):<br/>
P1 -- _P_lanted (I have several others ready to go as soon as I make a<br/>
stamp I'm happy with, a good carver I'm not! :))<br/>
F23 -- _F_ound (that don't fit in any other category)<br/>
X0 -- e_X_changes (on the trail)<br/>
A5 -- _A_dopted (Several letterboxers no longer live around here)<br/>
HH3 -- _H_itch_H_ikers found (I haven't planted any yet, and I use<br/>
hitchhiker and traveller interchangably)<br/>
FF5 -- First Finds (Apparently, I'm incredibly lucky at this, I don't<br/>
know anyone else that has a 1 out of 6 average)<br/>
V3 -- _V_irtual box (on the internet, not in real life)<br/>
E0 -- _E_vent (letterboxing party)<br/>
GC1 -- _G_eo_C_ache (I found it while looking for a box, confused the<br/>
heck out of me at first! :))<br/>
PLB1 -- _P_ostal _L_etter _B_ox (You don't find it, it finds you! :D)<br/>
<br/>
I also know of one letterboxer who uses C0, meaning "Confiscated by<br/>
Park Rangers = None" :D<br/>
-- Dagonell the Pirate<br/>
(Who could really confuse things further by posting his geek code from<br/>
http://www.geekcode.com  :D :D)<br/>

In our part of the state counting these would be difficult! We could literally <br/>
count hundreds of both!  Just last outing we came across 3 snake s in a half <br/>
mile stretch and dozens of lizards! How about this one?<br/>
<br/>

We saw 4 of these on one of our hikes to get a Funhog box here in Central <br/>

&gt; In our part of the state counting these would be difficult! We <br/>
could literally <br/>
&gt; count hundreds of both!  Just last outing we came across 3 snake s <br/>
in a half <br/>
&gt; mile stretch and dozens of lizards! How about this one?<br/>

&gt; WO- wild otters!<br/>

&gt; We saw 4 of these on one of our hikes to get a Funhog box here in <br/>
Central <br/>
