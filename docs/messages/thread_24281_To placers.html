boxes get less visitors could be that some of us do the activity with  <br/>
children or significant others who don't have the same gusto as we  <br/>
might like;-)<br/>
<br/>
It does seem easier to get them to go a little farther for ones where  <br/>
we know there is a neat waterfall or scenery at the end or like  <br/>
someone else mentioned several boxes along the way helps the motivation.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like time is often in short supply these days for many  <br/>
families. I am very happy to be able to sneak in a quick box or two  <br/>
between all of life's demands. Or on the way to something. If there  <br/>
weren't any nearby I wouldn't get to box very often:-(<br/>
So, THANKS to ALL planters for beautiful views &amp; stamps, long and  <br/>
short hikes and clever clues!!<br/>
