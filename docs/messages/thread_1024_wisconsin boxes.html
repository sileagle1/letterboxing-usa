<div>JUDY AND I JUST GOT BACK FROM A VACATION TO MY BOYHOOD HOME IN 
MILWAUKEE, WISC.</div>
<div>WE HAD TIME TO SEARCH OUT A FEW LETTERBOXES NEARBY. WE ARE 
PLEASED TO HAVE FOUND THE OTIS REDDING TRIBUTE LETTERBOX. WE WERE THE FIRST, AND 
WERE VERY EXCITED TO FIND ONE OF THE BEST STAMPS YET. A #10 FOR SURE. 
UNFORTUNATELY THE DAVID LEWIS CROSBY BOX WE COULD NOT FIND AND BELIEVE IT MAY BE 
MISSING. THE MAJESTIC THEATER BOX IS MOST DEFINITELY MISSING (THE GROUNDS 
KEEPERS MOST LIKELY HAVE FOUND IT). FURTHER EAST WE SEARCH FOR THE AZTALAN BOX 
AND BELIEVE IT MAY HAVE BEEN PLACED TO NEAR THE RIVER.  WE DID HAVE A 
CHANCE TO PUT OUT A BOX AT KETTLE MORAINE SOUTH. THE NAME IF THIS BOX IS " 
EAGLE"</div>
<div> WE HAD TIME TO STOP IN AT R.E.I AND TALK THE MANAGERS 
EAR OFF ABOUT LETTERBOXING . HE HAD ACCESS TO THE WEB AND I SHOWED HIM THE SITE. 
I HOPE HE CAN GENERATE SOME INTEREST. WISCONSIN IS VERY BEAUTIFUL 
STATE.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><em><u>CLUES</u></em></div>
<div>FROM THE PARK  HEADQUARTERS TAKE THE NATURE TRAIL @ 40 
DEGREES.</div>
<div>AT THE TOP OF THE HILL TAKE THE TRAIL TO THE 
LEFT.</div>
<div>STOP AT THE ROLLER COASTER AND SIGHT THE MAJESTIC OAK TREE 
@138 DEGREES.</div>
<div>AT THE BASE OF THE TREE UNDER THE CAIRN ( NOT TOO MANY ROCKS 
IN THESE PARTS).</div>
<div>AND YOU WILL FIND AN EAGLE.</div>
<div>CONTINUE ON THE TRAIL BACK TO THE MAIN OFFICE BLDG., TAKE TIME 
TO SEE THE MUSEUM.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a quick update on the status of those Wisconsin<br/>
letterboxes:<br/>
Madison area - The Majestic Theater letterbox is gone<br/>
for sure, but that's actually okay as it originally<br/>
commemorated the closing of the 100 year old theater<br/>
which has recently been reopened!  I'd have to update<br/>
the box anyway, so now I'll just replace it with a new<br/>
one.<br/>
As for the Crosby letterbox, it had gone missing once,<br/>
been returned, and I do not know if Deborah has<br/>
replaced it in the original spot yet.<br/>
Aztalan - It's possible that it got washed away, but<br/>
it wasn't all that close to the river.  I'll check on<br/>
it when next I get down that way.<br/>
Door County - The Sherwood Point Lighthouse box is<br/>
gone, but will soon be replaced at a new and improved<br/>
location.  A letterbox at the end of Sherwood Point,<br/>
but not lighthouse based, was placed by Dierdra last<br/>
year, but has yet to be linked to the site.  The same<br/>
goes for her letterbox on on the south side of the<br/>
shipping canal in Sturgeon Bay.<br/>
Green Bay area - Dierdra had placed a wonderful series<br/>
of eight boxes along the East River Trail, which when<br/>
stamped in the right order form a larger picture. <br/>
It's really quite impressive, but it never got linked<br/>
to the site either.<br/>
<br/>
I think that covers all the Wisconsin issues for the<br/>
moment. Everything else is still in place to the best<br/>
of my knowledge.  <br/>

 "Wha?" (she raises her cobwebbed head from the trillionth<br/>
packing box and pushes her glasses up her nose in order to<br/>
read that message again...) Yahoooooo!!  So happy to hear<br/>
that it is still out there! Still in good shape? Not mildewed or<br/>
soggy? We have to be out of our house by the 25th or I'd run<br/>
out the door for a looksee myself! Thanks for stopping by!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ...UNFORTUNATELY THE DAVID LEWIS CROSBY BOX <br/>
&gt; WE COULD NOT FIND AND BELIEVE IT MAY BE MISSING...<br/>
<br/>
Sigh... somehow I had a feeling that it would not last. I did<br/>
move it from its last position as it was found so easily by<br/>
passersby, but because I wanted to put it in the same general<br/>
area I'm afraid the second spot was not any better. Perhaps<br/>
it was too close to the trail... I'm afraid I'm too persnickety to<br/>
stray too far. (Think I'll write a little FAQ for the persnickety<br/>
letterboxer... supplies to include in your backpack would <br/>
include baby wipes, latex gloves, tongs, Lysol disinfectant<br/>
spray and one of those kid's toys ~ the long stick with a<br/>
handle on the end that closes a hinged claw or jaw...)<br/>
  Ah well... I grieved for that box before ~ now it's in double<br/>
jeopardy or something so can't be sad about it again!<br/>
  Still plan to have it made in rubber one of these <br/>
days. If you'd like a print I took from it before putting it out<br/>
I'd be glad to send you a postcard! Let me know... (before<br/>
the 25th! I think that when I unplug this computer it will <br/>
permanently turn into a pumpkin.)<br/>
Y'all come back now, y'hear?!!! Hope after the move I'll<br/>
have time to search for a few boxes including the new one<br/>
you put out in Kettle Moraine! Thanks!!!<br/>

    Pumpkins can be magical - just think of Cinderella.  Hope you will<br/>
stay in touch and good luck with the move.  I was enjoying your<br/>
unselfish giver stamp just a few days ago - don't disappear!<br/>
