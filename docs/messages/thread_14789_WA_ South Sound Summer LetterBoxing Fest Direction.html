<br/>
If you are NorthBound on I-5, you have the easy route.  Take Exit 103, Deschutes Parkway.  At the STOP sign, continue straight ahead.  Go past the entrance to Tumwater Falls Park, you can stop by there later.  You will pass the Boston Street Bridge (on the right) which is closed for reconstruction.  You will take the next right, which takes you into Tumwater Historical Park.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are SouthBound on I-5, it is a little more difficult, so we will give you the scenic way.  Take Exit 104, which is US 101, heading out to the coast.  Keep right, you will take the first exit, Crosby Blvd/Cooper Point Rd/Capital AutoMall Drive. Turn right at the light, turn right at the light (going on two sides of the AM/PM).  You are on Lakeridge.  Take the second left (by Thurston County Courthouse Building 4, the two story building with orange panels under the windows).  You will head down hill after going by the entrance to the Thurston County CourthouZ.  When you get to the bottom of the hill, you are on Deschutes Parkway.  Turn right, go under the Freeway, don't turn left onto I-5 NB, but turn left at the second road, which takes you into the Tumwater Historical Park.<br/>
<br/>
If all goes well, we will be loitering around the picnic tables by the playground.  You can tell us by our ink-stained fingers.<br/>
<br/>
See you there!!!!<br/>
