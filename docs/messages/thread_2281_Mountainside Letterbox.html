Mountainside Park<br/>
Placed by Wingfoot on 05/02/01<br/>
Pequanock, Morris County, New Jersey<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Easy<br/>
Terrain:    Moderately Easy<br/>
<br/>
Note:<br/>
This is not for small children.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS: Mountainside Park is a Morris County Park in northern Morris <br/>
County, New Jersey. From Interstate 287 get off at Route 23 heading south. <br/>
Just before the first light turn right and keep bearing right onto West <br/>
Parkway for about 1/2 mile to the first intersection with a 4-way stop. Turn <br/>
right onto Mountain Avenue, which will pass under Interstate 287. Once you <br/>
pass under the bridge the park is immediately on your right.  Park your car <br/>
along the right side of the road. If you come to a no trespassing sign, <br/>
you've gone too far.  Note, you will probably not see any signs saying you <br/>
are at Mountainside Park. Alternately, from Route 23 North in Pompton Plains, <br/>
take 511 ALT to make a U-turn onto Route 23 South and follow the directions <br/>
above.<br/>
<br/>
Look for Green Acres signs on trees.<br/>
Search along roadside for sky blue blaze trail.<br/>
Once sky blue blazes are located start out on trail. <br/>
Take dark blue blaze trail.<br/>
Blazes will start to alternate from dark to sky blue in no specific order, <br/>
stay on trail.<br/>
At second campfire take unmarked path to the right.<br/>
Take 22 paces along unmarked trail.<br/>
Stop at tree with fading white paint on it.<br/>

I mentioned on the site a couple weeks ago that I was going to move <br/>
the Mountainside Letterbox.  I thought better of the idea, the box is <br/>
going to stay in it's current location.  I most likely will add <br/>
another box to the park where I was planning to move the Mountainside <br/>
box to. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>    Just wanted to say that I hiked out to your box today.  I was very 
<br/>psyched since this was my first letterbox find on my own.  Anyway, your box 
<br/>is still intact and the little puddle of water inside was emptied before I 
<br/>rehid it.  I have to admit, I was literally jumping up and down when I 
<br/>finally found it, lol.  Cool stamp too :)

I'm glad you found the Mountainside box.  I'm surprised it was wet <br/>
because it was under a big rock, but these things happen.  I've <br/>
planted 10 boxes so far and the Mountainside box is probaly my least <br/>
favorite, but seems to get the most visitors.  I checked on the <br/>
Tripod Rock Box on Friday and it still only had 4 visitors.  If you <br/>
get the chance you should go for my Pyramid/Turkey Moutain sets.  <br/>
They're close to the Mountainside box and if you go on a clear day <br/>
some of the views are outstanding.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing<br/>

Although, using my problem-solving and deductive reasoning skills <br/>
honed by letterboxing, I would guess New Jersey?<br/>
