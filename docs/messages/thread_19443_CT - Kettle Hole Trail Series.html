                    <div class="plaintext-content">We did the series 5/22 and found bits of plastic around #7 with the <br/>
word "Deer" on it... neatly piled up the bits o' plastic and talked <br/>
with Exchangers at Moose Hill that actually picked up the sad <br/>
remaining plastic pieces.  We couldnt find 12, 13 or 16 and suspected <br/>
them missing, but who knows, we might have missed them.  We couldnt <br/>
search #17 for a birthday party in the area.  Glad to hear the <br/>
missing boxes are on the mend, and we'll go back for them sometime!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Carolyn for placeing many great boxes we've enjoyed in the <br/>
area!<br/>
