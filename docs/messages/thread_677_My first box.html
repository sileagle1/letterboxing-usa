Oh, and your hunt begins at Liberty State Park.(14B of the NJ Turnpike ) <br/>
<br/>
Where once there were tales of hardship and woe, <br/>
A hunt now begins on the Isle of Bedloe.<br/>
You start from the highest point in the land,<br/>
and remember there is no way into the lady's hand.<br/>
Gaze down upon the ramparts of the ol' Fort Wood,<br/>
view it from the fifth window, you should.<br/>
Don't forget the point of the star you see right below,<br/>
Now head back down to the soil of Bedloe.<br/>
From the tip of that star look out toward the sea,<br/>
in a northerly direction is where you wish to be.<br/>
Before your feet carry you into the harbor,<br/>
you will notice three machines that help you see farther.<br/>
Now you ask yourself, "Which one can it be?"<br/>
Well, if you originate from Brobdingnag,<br/>
a problem finishing the clue I forsee.<br/>
Give this machine your hard earned two bits,<br/>
and scan the horizon for where Old Glory sits.<br/>
You'll know you're looking in the correct place,<br/>
when you see double right before your face!<br/>
Now you must use all of your powers,<br/>
and get yourself in between those two towers.<br/>
Here is where the tricky pieces start,<br/>
Will you be able to advance to the next part?<br/>
"Which path from here?" begins your plight,<br/>
That's easy, follow your inalienable right.<br/>
Search down this path for your next mark, <br/>
a circle of red surrounding one that is dark.<br/>
From the center of this spot look out toward the sky,<br/>
a group of tall trees to the north you will spy.<br/>
Get as close to this grove as the state will permit,<br/>
walk as quickly to the yellow marker as you see fit.<br/>
At 90 degrees you notice the next step in your quest,<br/>
when you reach it pull up a bench for a quick rest.<br/>
Now you need to know which of the three paths to choose,<br/>
follow where the three boats point and you can't lose.<br/>
Follow this path to your 54th pace,<br/>
LEFT FACE!<br/>
Now off the path, walk towards the sea,<br/>
in the cairn between two trees is where your treasure will be.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I hope everyone has fun with it!<br/>

You are far too modest - your clue is really fun to read at this<br/>
distance, and I am sure will be lots of fun in the hunt. Good going!<br/>
