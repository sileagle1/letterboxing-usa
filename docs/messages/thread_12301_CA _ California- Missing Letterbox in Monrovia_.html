I'm afraid this LB is missing; I reported it missing on this Group in <br/>

hiding place.  <br/>

Canyon if memory serves, and Don and Gwen have a high-traffic box in<br/>
Pasadena as well.  These are all listed on letterboxing.org.<br/>

Many people list their clues on their own sites, but usually these are<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for getting back to me. I was doubting my letterboxing <br/>
skills!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you know why the park officials pulled it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Still, it certainly was a great hike.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You didn't miss it, it was pulled by the park officials and we <br/>

&gt; &gt; had it pulled off the site. Terribly sorry for the inconvenience, <br/>
&gt; but we<br/>
&gt; &gt; are glad you enjoyed the hike.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Jay, if you're reading this, could you pull the box listing?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I'm afraid this LB is missing; I reported it missing on this <br/>
Group <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; March. It's a very pretty hike, though, and seemed like a great <br/>
&gt; &gt; hiding place. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Went searching for "Another Waterfall Letterbox" in Monrovia, <br/>
CA, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; couldn't find it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Clues were pretty straight forward, and everything went exactly <br/>
&gt; as <br/>
&gt; &gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was supposed to except at the end, when the box simply wasn't <br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This was planted in December by 'Threedigs', does anyone know <br/>
if <br/>
&gt; &gt; it's <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; still there and I just missed it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>
