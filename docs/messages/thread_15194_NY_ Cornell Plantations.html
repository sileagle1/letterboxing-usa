                    <div class="plaintext-content">99% sure.  We coordinated all the other clues and I felt we were<br/>
correct - they all fit.  The last one matched the trail name.  It is<br/>
possible though that we were wrong.  Won't have a chance to check<br/>
again until next year.  Not knowing if my pace was accurate or not we<br/>
tried several times. The area we came up with had a lot of recent<br/>
plantings - like within this month as well as the addition of what<br/>
looked like a new bench - hard to tell.  Should have asked someone if<br/>
it was new construction.  The other area we thought it was (remember<br/>
my pace dilema)just got us very muddy - three thunderstorms that<br/>
afternoon. :-)  Thanks for answering.  Guess I just have to be more<br/>
patient. Hope we're more successful this weekend. <br/>
