                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just home after a 24 mile foray into the wilderness via bike, and hooboy -- <br/>
I saw my first wild animal.  A coyote, just jogging along beside a female <br/>
jogger near the end of this trail, and though she put on a brave face, she <br/>
was looking (understandably) nervous.  Freaky, that.<br/>
<br/>
All that aside, here are the clues:<br/>
<br/>
NAME:  BGT Mallard and Horse Apples boxes<br/>
placed by/on:  Eliza B/9-8-02<br/>
County: All King (I think)<br/>
nearest city: Seattle et. al.<br/>
difficulty: if you're walking, don't.  It's 25 miles.  But on a bike, <br/>
easy.  Clues: way easy.<br/>
stamp: Crappy, as usual.  Carved on-site with sugar crash going on.<br/>
<br/>
This is a continuation of the semi-mystery Trail of Snakes.  (it will be <br/>
five boxes long at the conclusion)  Begin from the first box.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
Go back to the trail detour.  (Until 12-02.  When the trail re-opens, just <br/>
take that.)  Follow the signs up the bigass hill and back onto the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Go for about ten miles.  No kidding.  Just keep going.<br/>
<br/>
At one point, you'll have a choice:  either go straight across a bridge <br/>
that says "No jumping", or left, down a hill.  Go down the hill and right, <br/>
across the other bridge.  Follow the trail down and to the left and <br/>
around.  You'll eventually see a wooden bridge arching across a <br/>
river.  Stop at the bridge.<br/>
<br/>
At 155, on the ground, are some logs.  under the closest one, when you roll <br/>
it slightly forward (no worries, the ground's already thrashed and is to be <br/>
paved at some point, from what I heard today), is the box.  Please be <br/>
careful -- this is a high-traffic area.  Say hi to the Mallard.  I promise <br/>
he'll say hi back.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES FOR HORSE APPLES(Seattle Pride):<br/>
<br/>
Get back on the trail and ride for another ten or so miles.  On the left, <br/>
you'll see a statue of a woman missing a chair.  Turn left and go roughly a <br/>
block, to the KING COUNTY RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING DEMONSTRATION SITE. <br/>
(Appropriate.)  Face the "What's in YOUR Waste" sign, and look right.  The <br/>
tall poplar, closest to the street, contains Horse Apples in the crook <br/>
where the two trunks meet.  It is covered with some leaves to keep it <br/>
safe.  Again, it's a high traffic area, be careful.<br/>
