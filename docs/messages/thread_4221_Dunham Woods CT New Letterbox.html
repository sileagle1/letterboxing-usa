<p>Dunham Woods</p></b>
<p>Placed: 1-18-02</p>
<p>Placed By: Chuck Straub and his dog Molly</p>
<p>Location: Mansfield CT, Tolland County</p>
<p>Rated: Easy</p>
<p>Owned by Joshua’s Trust, the entrance to this property is 1.2 miles from the 
intersection of Route 195 in Storrs on South Eagleville Road (Route 275). It 
will be on the left hand side of the road and you will have to turn around to 
park your car on that side of the road in one of the few spots available. Follow 
the yellow marked trees down the path. You will come to a sign which states: 
Dunham Woods, Joshua’s Trust, Carrick McLoughlin Memorial Trail. Go over a long 
three plank wide bridge over a wet area. Be careful, it is very slippery when 
wet. The trail goes slightly up hill and you will come to an intersection in 
which you may take a white trail or one of the two yellow tails. Take the West 
yellow trail. You will see a fallen tree, and stone bench and a tablet imbedded 
in a boulder. This spot overlooks Dunham pond and I always make it a point to 
stop here when in Dunham Woods. Continue on and cross a small wooden bridge and 
quickly you will come to a T in the trail. Go South over a rocky area down the 
yellow trail. Not counting the double yellow marked tree at the T, go South to 
the 2<sup>nd</sup> tree with a yellow mark that is facing you. Stop at that tree 
and take a reading of 75 degrees. Go in that direction into the woods to three 
large oaks seemingly growing from one trunk. Look around the base of this oak 
and find your prize buried under a pile of sticks. Follow the same route back to 
your car. This letterbox would go nice with a trip to the Queen of Hearts 
Letterbox with is very close, down the road at Owen’s 
Mare.</p></div></body></html>
