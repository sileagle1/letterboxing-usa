We had a lovely hike in Sky Meadows park on Wednesday June 25.  It <br/>
was a long afternoon.  We managed to hike all but 3 of the trails in <br/>
the park and on the way found all of the boxes.  All of the boxes <br/>
were in good shape.  We found all of The Sarah Special: A Triple <br/>
Sized Feast of Fancy boxes in the open and rehid them way better <br/>
then we found them. We saw lots of wildlife.  It was a great day to <br/>
take off and head to the woods.  <br/>

Okay 10am at the Park Center.  The Triple V Gang (or at least those of us<br/>
who don't have to work on Saturday, blech) will deliver Ryan from the front <br/>
door of his hotel to the pavilion at the parking area.  We are hoping to<br/>
meet a bunch of you!  Oh AND, in the past HF has had a huge beautiful<br/>
fireworks display on the Saturday before the 4th so you may want to make a day of <br/>
it, or maybe we should start later?<br/>

center.  It's only $5 per carload and they run very nice shuttle buses<br/>
into (and back from) Harper's Ferry every 15 minutes. These buses drop off at<br/>
a nice covered pavillion with benches that could theoretically be used for<br/>
the exchanges.<br/>
  After a very recent trip there I really don't think there would be<br/>
enough parking for everyone who says they want to attend and a $5 donation per<br/>
family to the park service for 'hosting' this event would be a nice gesture. <br/>
  Just a thought.<br/>

The Triple V Gang met up with Ryan again last night at the Blackburn Trail <br/>
Center.  We met lots of cool hikerfolk and had a very enjoyable visit. <br/>
Since no decision has been made as to when and where to meet I couldn't give<br/>
Ryan a time or place but I am set to email him as soon as we decide.  I<br/>
know that parking is a premium in HF so I'm just not sure where the best place <br/>
is.  My personal vote is for the AT headquarters but again parking may be<br/>
an issue.  If we all park down at the river where the parking lots are we<br/>
could just meet somewhere down there and walk up the hill to the icecream<br/>
place for refreshments.<br/>
<br/>
So what does everyone think?  Who else is coming?  10am at the parking<br/>
area by the river?<br/>

obsessed with good eatin' but we're asking because we probably can't make<br/>
it <br/>
until 12:30 or 1 0'clock'ish.  We wanted to see if we could catch up with <br/>

&gt;Okay 10am at the Park Center.  The Triple V Gang (or at least those of us <br/>
<br/>
&gt;who don't have to work on Saturday, blech) will deliver Ryan from the<br/>
front <br/>
&gt;door of his hotel to the pavilion at the parking area.  We are hoping to <br/>
&gt;meet a bunch of you!  Oh AND, in the past HF has had a huge beautiful <br/>
&gt;fireworks display on the Saturday before the 4th so you may want to make<br/>
a <br/>
&gt;day of it, or maybe we should start later?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;So what does everyone think?  Who else is coming?  10am at the parking<br/>

<br/>
Last evening, my letterboxing partner and I took the short hike to Bear's<br/>
Rock near Durham. Since it stays light so late in the evening, this Drew<br/>
Clan letterbox can easily be done after work. When we were there, there was<br/>
not another soul around.<br/>
<br/>
The Mountain Laurels were in full bloom and the trail was a fairy-land of<br/>
white and pale pink. In addition, the view is not to be missed. <br/>
<br/>
This box, placed in 2000, has a nice stamp, is in good shape and hasn't<br/>
had many visitors lately. Take a few moments to look through the logbook at<br/>
all the box finders' marvelous stamps that have come to grace its pages over <br/>
the last three years.<br/>
<br/>
Jay, this one's a gem. Thanks for a perfect evening! <br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Okay 10am at the Park Center.  The Triple V Gang (or at least <br/>
those of us <br/>
&gt; &gt;who don't have to work on Saturday, blech) will deliver Ryan from <br/>
the front <br/>
&gt; &gt;door of his hotel to the pavilion at the parking area.  We are <br/>
hoping to <br/>
&gt; &gt;meet a bunch of you!  Oh AND, in the past HF has had a huge <br/>
beautiful <br/>
&gt; &gt;fireworks display on the Saturday before the 4th so you may want <br/>
to make a <br/>
&gt; &gt;day of it, or maybe we should start later?<br/>

park <br/>
&gt; &gt;center.  It's only $5 per carload and they run very nice shuttle <br/>
buses into <br/>
&gt; &gt;(and back from) Harper's Ferry every 15 minutes. These buses drop <br/>
off at a <br/>
&gt; &gt;nice covered pavillion with benches that could theoretically be <br/>
used for <br/>
&gt; &gt;the exchanges.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   After a very recent trip there I really don't think there <br/>
would be <br/>
&gt; &gt;enough parking for everyone who says they want to attend and a $5 <br/>
donation <br/>
&gt; &gt;per family to the park service for 'hosting' this event would be <br/>
a nice <br/>
&gt; &gt;gesture.   Just a thought.<br/>

&gt; &gt;The Triple V Gang met up with Ryan again last night at the <br/>
Blackburn Trail <br/>
&gt; &gt;Center.  We met lots of cool hikerfolk and had a very enjoyable <br/>
visit.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;Since no decision has been made as to when and where to meet I <br/>
couldn't <br/>
&gt; &gt;give Ryan a time or place but I am set to email him as soon as we <br/>
decide.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;I know that parking is a premium in HF so I'm just not sure where <br/>
the best <br/>
&gt; &gt;place is.  My personal vote is for the AT headquarters but again <br/>
parking <br/>
&gt; &gt;may be an issue.  If we all park down at the river where the <br/>
parking lots <br/>
&gt; &gt;are we could just meet somewhere down there and walk up the hill <br/>
to the <br/>
&gt; &gt;icecream place for refreshments.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So what does everyone think?  Who else is coming?  10am at the <br/>
parking area <br/>
&gt; &gt;by the river?<br/>

for those<br/>

they have<br/>
&gt; &gt;bathrooms and a shower for Ryan :).  They would probably love to <br/>
have ya'll<br/>
