Soccer Fan really wanted to go to the beach rather than to the Giant).  While we <br/>
were there, we checked on the four Harkness boxes.  I am sad to report that the <br/>
Eolia Mansion box may be missing.  It was not in its hiding place when we <br/>
checked on it.  However someone may have had the box away from the area to stamp <br/>
in.  <br/>
<br/>
If you were at Harkness yesterday and had the box for stamping in, please let <br/>
me know!  If I don't hear from anyone, I'll start carving the stamp and <br/>
replacing the box.<br/>
<br/>
All of the other boxes are in good shape.  McCann Reunion box is now on the <br/>
other side of the rock in the brush, since the park workers actually weedwacked <br/>
around the box.  The box had no covering (no rocks or anything) except for <br/>
weedwacked grass.  It's amazing that the box is still there.  Obviously the <br/>
Harkness workers don't mind the boxes being there!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting everyone!<br/>
