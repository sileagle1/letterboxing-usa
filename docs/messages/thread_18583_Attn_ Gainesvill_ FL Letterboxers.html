As my husband the former southerner would say, I'm "fixin' to" head down head down to Gainesville, FL this weekend for my step-daughters graduation from U of F (Go Gators!!). I will have some time on Saturday to possibly hunt boxes and/or meet up with a local boxer for an image exchange. Please email me off-list if interested, thanks!<br/>

<br/>
Red's Bunch will be in Florida that week as well, and<br/>
we're similarly interested in boxing between Tifton,<br/>
GA, and Orlando, FL. <br/>
<br/>
We'll be driving thru Gainesville on Sunday morning,<br/>
but we'll be letterboxing there on Friday the 7th as<br/>
we drive back thru on our way home.<br/>
<br/>
We've printed off the ones around Orlando that we want <br/>
to hunt during the week, and if anyone knows any other <br/>
boxes in that area that are not on the LbNA list, <br/>
please let us know!<br/>

Hey Red, <br/>
<br/>
just a fair warning that the Wilderness Lodge letterbox *might* be missing.  <br/>
I've sent a note to the placers and not heard anything back (although I asked<br/>
them to forward my mail to their most recent finders, so maybe that's the <br/>
hold up)<br/>
<br/>
It's just as possible that it's still there and I missed it<br/>
<br/>

Then again, I was sure it was missing back in October, and someone found it <br/>
after we were there.   Red, if you find it, I'd be really interested to hear <br/>
about it, because we've tried twice now with no luck.<br/>
