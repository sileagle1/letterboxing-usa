I'm new to letterboxing and I live in the Rio Grande of Texas.  I just<br/>
started "listening in" on the conversations and heard that you are coming to<br/>
Brownsville.  I am interested in launching letterboxing in the Rio Grande<br/>
Valley by organizing a group and placing boxes in the wild life corridors<br/>
and parks to enhance the eco-tourism here.  Any help would be appreciated<br/>
and if possible, I would like to meet you when you are down.  I'm in<br/>
McAllen, but I would be willing to drive to Brownsville to meet you and have<br/>
you show me a few things about letterboxing.<br/>
I'll stay tuned.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
