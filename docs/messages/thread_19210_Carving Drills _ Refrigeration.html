    Is it true that putting the rubber into the refrigerator makes it easier to carve?  I can see that, in that the rubber has a lot of give to it.  Maybe it makes it firmer and less squishy?  How long do you keep it in?  Is a freezer just too much?  I suppose a microwave would be a bad idea.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I tried freezing the pink stuff to see if it would retain rigidity<br/>
better for carving areas such as lettering or areas needing precise<br/>
details. It didn't really have the desired effect, but it did make my<br/>
hand cold while I carved. I would suggest just obtaining a magnifying<br/>
lens instead and replacing the carving blades often.<br/>
