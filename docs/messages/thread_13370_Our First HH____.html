                    <div class="plaintext-content">We found our first HH today on our travels. We actually didn't expect to<br/>
find one as we only do about four boxes a week on average, all within a 30<br/>
mile radius of our home. We didn't know that Cincinnati Raven was visiting<br/>
the greater Los Angeles area! We'll be getting the raven flying on it's way<br/>
once more soon and we're having a great time reading about raven's travels<br/>
in the mean time. Of course now my son wants to include HHs in his<br/>
letterboxing project...<br/>
<br/>
A side thing I wanted to mention was today we tied together two hobbies for<br/>
the first time. We were hosting a flat traveler (a la Flat Stanley) and took<br/>
her out with us hunting boxes. She's got her first four stamps to take back<br/>
to Canada, where she came from, and hopefully get her family into the hobby<br/>
as well. So if you start seeing stamps in books from someone who's first<br/>
name happens to be "Flat" don't be surprised - we're planning to keep taking<br/>
our travelers with us as they seem to enjoy the hunt :)<br/>

Is it expected that you email the boxer when you find the HH or when you've<br/>
sent it on it's way or both?<br/>

I think people like to know where their wandering boxes are. It's just a nice <br/>
little pick-me-up to know how far they have traveled.<br/>
