We found it in Pleasant Hill, CA.  Unfortunately, the box it was <br/>
hitched to was sitting out in the open, and there was no log book <br/>
for TAO.  We would like permission to create another log book for <br/>
this stamp before we re-plant it.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, there was a note in the "host" letterbox that a person <br/>
in a such-and-such model car was looking to meet guys for a <br/>
little action.  Since almost all of the people who had stamped <br/>
into the book were kids, and since (presumably) the person who <br/>
left this note wasn't a letterboxer, we removed that page from the <br/>
log book.  It just seemed too creepy!<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone had to deal with that particular issue before?  <br/>
