<br/>
I feel that any communication regarding any placement of any letterbox <br/>
should be sent to the placers. The placer has control over the <br/>
placement, clue posting, and any editing function regarding their <br/>
letterbox. I believe that was one of the reasons the LBNA site was <br/>
switched over to "placer" control was to help defer liability and put <br/>
the onus onto the placer.  While this topic tends to push some "Hot" <br/>
buttons, there is little that further discussion can really <br/>
accomplish. Since Mitch wishes to stir up the list with some old <br/>
topics maybe he would like to refight the Revolutionary war too.<br/>
