                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was reading a Family Fun magazine this last weekend and saw an article about letterboxing and checked out the website.  As soon as my son woke up I told him all about it and he was as interested as I was.<br/>
<br/>
  We found our 1st 3 letterboxes that day.  One of them had 3 items in it as well, a shell, a coin and something else.<br/>
<br/>
  My daughter is a girl scout and I told her troop leader about it.  We may take it up as a scouting hobby as well.<br/>
<br/>
  Can't wait to find more :)  My daughter likes the idea of making her own stamps.  It was something she learned in art class in school-so she'll be able to teach Mom something new, lol.<br/>
<br/>
  NY Team Wolf (we all may end up with our own names as well, but my son chose this one :)<br/>
