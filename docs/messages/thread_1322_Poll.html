Hi, all.  Susan recently drew a bit of fan-art for fun, and submitted it to a<br/>
contest this person was having to celebrate her website getting its 100,000th<br/>
hit.  The person who's fanart gets the most votes gets a free commision from<br/>
this person.  Here's a link to the poll:<br/>
http://user.tninet.se/~mul858u/party/<br/>
You can probably guess which is Susan.  Somewhat unsurprisingly, I think hers<br/>
is the best and I don't really know why people are voting for the others.<br/>
(Especially #2.  The art on the card was done by the owner of the website.<br/>
The person who made the picture just dropped it into what is probably a scan<br/>
of a Magic card.  How lame!)  So, you should vote for Susan, if you like it.<br/>
If you like one of the other ones better, though, you definitely shouldn't<br/>
vote.  This isn't a democracy, dammit.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Unfortunately the poll is set up so that you can only choose one answer. There could be several answers that fit and fix the problem.<br/>
<br/>
 *Enhancement of the need to check out FAQS pages to find answers.<br/>
<br/>
 * Private communication. This could be noticed on the chatlist  "I've got this."<br/>
<br/>
 *Direction via chatlist to appropriate locations,i.e.FAQS, and alternative sites.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While most new folks may not be sure where to go for info, my guess is they wouldn't be put off with multiple private responses. So several enthusiastic letterboxers could jump on the newby with their private responses.  This current chatlist problem pales in comparison to what could occur if the present membership is doubled or tripled. Most of our 1600+ letterboxers do not post, but when total numbers are increased the number of chatlist posts will also increase. When that happens a simple solution would be to send a simple note out with  www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html. While I'm no computer guru I would bet that there could be an easy ,almost automatic response set up that a member could click on to send the new folks this site.<br/>

Since the list is already "first post moderated" perhaps we can have <br/>
the moderators send the FAQ (or link) to new posters with a note <br/>
something like:<br/>
<br/>
"Please read the attached/linked FAQ for this list and notify us <br/>

We realize that some of the more experienced &gt; members might get annoyed by seeing the same questions over and over &gt; again, however these questions are part of the learning process; the &gt; rate at which letterboxing continues to blossom means that these &gt; questions will continue and the information will need to continually &gt; be disseminated. &gt; &gt; In an effort to reduce the amount of flames thrown across the list we &gt; have created a collection in the links section of this group &gt; entitled "A collection<br/>

It's not the questions so much as the multitude and length of <br/>
answers. Simple posts with direction to links would be great, but a <br/>
complete thesis on the list concerning the why and where for of any <br/>
of the various nuances in our hobby is a bit tiring. Yup, I know <br/>
there always is the concept of hitting delete or changing the form <br/>
that you receive the list. Think of the future, and would you like <br/>
to see 3 ,4, or 5 times the number of questions asked on this list <br/>
that can be answered better, and more efficiently without impacting <br/>
the chatlist or turning the list into a forum to answer questions ?<br/>
I don't believe there is any letterboxer that wishes to close up <br/>
joining. In fact when ever I see a post from a new letterboxer in a <br/>
nearby area I usually contact them off list to encourage them. <br/>
Hopefully they will plant some boxes! I would probably do the same <br/>
thing even if they were sent to a FAQS page.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Here's the deal. No matter how many times a question is answered,<br/>
&gt;&gt; people will join after the answer is posted. The new folks will<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt;&gt; the same questions. An automatic FAQ will help, but those who wish<br/>
&gt;&gt; there was never another 'newbie' question posted just aren't going<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;&gt; get their wish -<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It's not the questions so much as the multitude and length of<br/>
&gt; answers. Simple posts with direction to links would be great, but a<br/>
&gt; complete thesis on the list concerning the why and where for of any<br/>
&gt; of the various nuances in our hobby is a bit tiring. Yup, I know<br/>
&gt; there always is the concept of hitting delete or changing the form<br/>
&gt; that you receive the list.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, my honest opinion is that the delete key is there to be <br/>
used. I mean absolutely no disrespect to anyone, but if a post looks <br/>
like it's a response you've seen before or a long exposition of <br/>
something you aren't interested in, then you have the option to delete <br/>
it before reading the whole thing. Would it be great if each inbox was <br/>
full of emails that we wanted to read and no others? Sure, but the <br/>
emails each of us want to read are different and this is a large group, <br/>
so we're all going to get emails we are interested in and some we <br/>
aren't. The delete key takes much less of my energy than trying to get <br/>
1600+ people to all toe my line, assuming I spend the energy to figure <br/>
out exactly what the line is...... All I am saying is that from a <br/>
purely practical point of view, a large group is going to produce a <br/>
wide variety of emails and, imho, overall, that's a better thing than <br/>
to limit what can and cannot be posted.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Think of the future, and would you like<br/>
&gt; to see 3 ,4, or 5 times the number of questions asked on this list<br/>
&gt; that can be answered better, and more efficiently without impacting<br/>
&gt; the chatlist or turning the list into a forum to answer questions ?<br/>
<br/>
Sure. If it means we have 3-5 times as many people hunting, creating, <br/>
planting, and mailing out boxes. Public answers will keep this number <br/>
down much more than private answers, but as I said, as each new crop of <br/>
boxers joins the group, they will not have seen the posts answering <br/>
previous questions. Some will hunt out answers, some will ask. There <br/>
are quite a few styles of learning and I'm not sure it's worth <br/>
discouraging new boxers because their learning style doesn't match <br/>
mine.......<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don't believe there is any letterboxer that wishes to close up<br/>
&gt; joining. In fact when ever I see a post from a new letterboxer in a<br/>
&gt; nearby area I usually contact them off list to encourage them.<br/>
&gt; Hopefully they will plant some boxes! I would probably do the same<br/>
&gt; thing even if they were sent to a FAQS page.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't mean to suggest that anyone actually wanted the list closed. I <br/>
doubt anyone does. I merely wanted to say that that's the only way <br/>
realistically to avoid 'newbie' questions being asked and answered <br/>
on-list. So long as we keep the list open, we will have questions show <br/>
up that have been asked before. As long as there are people who chat <br/>
and gather and such, the list will not become question-only, but <br/>
neither will it ever be question-free.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I think it's great that you, and others, encourage <br/>
folks. That's what it's all about. With a most friendly tone, I <br/>
recommend a deep breath and a counting-to-ten and a reach for the <br/>
delete key for anyone who actually gets upset by questions that have <br/>
been asked before. Realistically, they will be asked and someone(s) <br/>
will answer.<br/>
<br/>

Here's an interesting thought.....  Why should the wants/needs of the few outweigh the wants/needs of the many?  <br/>
There's a vocal minority (And I include myself in that group) that are active on the mailing lists and a Majority that <br/>
are not.  Just because a few don't want to be bothered by the same questions asked over and over and over again, why <br/>
should we stop answering questions?  I for one believe that a person can exercise their own censorship if you will, by <br/>
not reading a post that's titled "What's a hitchhiker?"  Why is that such a hard thing?<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of pissing off every feminist on this group, I kinda think this debate is as useful as the age old debate <br/>
over, Toilet seat up or Toilet seat down.  Women could just as well put the seat up when they were done as men can <br/>
put it down when they are done.  Yet the debate still rages. And will continue to do so for the rest of time.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think we should censor or stop anyone from asking anything at all on this list no matter how many times it's <br/>
been asked in the past. After all, this is the place where people come to learn about letterboxing, isn't it? And <br/>
that's one way to welcome new members isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
If it comes down to closing this list to new people and/or stopping the questions then I'll say this: I don't like the <br/>
idea for some of the same reasons why I don't like My Documents, remote avatars, My Computer, vanity plates, mile long <br/>
URLs, %20, reality shows, and war. If that didn't make much sense, that is the point....<br/>
<br/>
Let's all just get out there and box!<br/>
