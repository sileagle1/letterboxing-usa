<br/>
I read your page and it has lots of nice colors on stamps. How <br/>
clever! I would never have thought about the rewetting them by <br/>
breathing on them.<br/>
<br/>
About the markers: are they water-based like the Crayola ones or some <br/>
other kind? How long will the color last if they are like the Crayola <br/>
ones I have?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
I haven't used the Crayola ones much, but the two times I have they <br/>
worked well enough.  I can't say how long they'll last--I have no <br/>
idea!  The markers I usually use are in those kits with a yellow <br/>
jacket.  Pentel, I think.  Fine tips.  (More detailed coloring, that <br/>
way!)  They'll come in sets of 12, 24, 36 or more or something like <br/>
that and can be found in most arts and craft stores.<br/>
<br/>
Most markers seem to work just fine.  Try them!  If you like the <br/>
results, get more colors.  If you don't, try something else.  *shrug*<br/>
<br/>
I wrote the webpage originally after I first 'discovered' multi-<br/>
colored stamping and used mostly markers at the time, although since <br/>
then I've tended to drift more towards small ink pads since they can <br/>
cover more area faster and you can still get quite intricate in the <br/>
coloring.  And they're actually MEANT for stamping with!  The only <br/>
changes I made to the webpage, however, was to include pictures as <br/>
examples, so my bias for markers still tends to show through in the <br/>
words.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm more biased towards the eye-shaped ink pads and daubbers, <br/>
although I still use fine tip markers for really small details that <br/>
the ink pads can't quite get.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!  =)<br/>

It's amazing how much different things can look with lots of colors as<br/>
opposed to just using an ink pad to stamp in.  I will probably stick<br/>
with my boring blue ink pad (just to keep things simple on the trail),<br/>
but it's so wonderful to see how creative one can get with a few extra<br/>
markers!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing, Ryan!  By the way...the new Zorro stamp is VERY<br/>
impressive.  Will you be at the Cornelius Pass Roadhouse get together in<br/>
Oregon next month?<br/>
