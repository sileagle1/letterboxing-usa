                    <div class="plaintext-content">I really like the idea of public thanks. You can easily do it without <br/>
mentioning the finders name.  They'll know who they are and if they <br/>
want to be acknowledged, they'll reply.  <br/>
<br/>
For instance:<br/>
I got a report from a boxer today regarding my "Catch a Falling Star" <br/>
letterbox.  I just want to say thank you to the finder travelling <br/>
from UT.  Also, to that person/people: I'm sure Garth wasn't <br/>
laughing, he was probably trying to tell you, "Go the OTHER way!!!" <br/>
to help you out!  He was like that. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So there's my 1st public thanks!<br/>

PS You can also thank last finders when you check on your boxes if <br/>
they are hidden well.<br/>

On Sunday, May Eve, Donutz and I were in search of the Disputed Champion!  We <br/>
found it!  But shortly after, my right eye had an unfortunate meeting with a <br/>
tree branch.  Being a Girl Scout, and born in New England, and raised in New <br/>
Jersey, I figured that I was pretty tough.  But eventually it got to be way too <br/>
much for me.  <br/>
<br/>
When it started raining, we called it a day, and MayEve drove me back to my <br/>
car.  When I realized that there was no way that I could drive myself anywhere, <br/>
she took me to the er, and then waited for me to be done in there.  <br/>
Fortunately, it didn't take too long.<br/>
<br/>
Then, on Tuesday, after being trapped in my house for two days, Music Woman <br/>
was kind enough to go grocery shopping for me and Mittens, and then stayed with <br/>
me for a little while before she had to go to work.<br/>
<br/>
I'd do the same for either of you ladies!<br/>

It's too bad that I had to go to work on Tuesday, or I could have <br/>
stayed to watch the end of the movie!  Did you see it?<br/>
<br/>
BTW... it was really nice to see you yesterday at the gathering and <br/>
I'm glad to see you're feeling better!  The eye no longer looks as red <br/>

I guess I should ammend that, then, by saying that this is my third corneal <br/>

flushed my eye out real good, but it stung for several hours afterward.<br/>

Does sitting on a scrub of cat briar when stamping in count?? how <br/>
embarassing to have your son say "Mom, drop your pants, I'll help you <br/>
