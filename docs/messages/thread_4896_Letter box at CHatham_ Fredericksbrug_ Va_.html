Placed by:		Jmcc and Busszz<br/>
Date Placed:		4/6/2<br/>
City:			Fredericksburg, Va.<br/>
<br/>
Location:		To get there, just leave downtown Fredericksburg<br/>
(old town section) going East on Rt. 3 (William Street). Take a left at the<br/>
first light after crossing the river and watch for the entrance to Chatham<br/>
on the left hand side. I don't think it's even a mile from the light.<br/>
Further information can be obtained at the Fredericksbrug Visitor Center on<br/>
the 700 block of Caroline Street.<br/>
<br/>
Description:<br/>
Chatham was a large farming house located in the hills over the Rappahanock<br/>
River near Fredericksbrug Va. Built in the 1700's it changed hands several<br/>
times. <br/>
During the Battle of Fredericksburg (Civil War) Chatham was used by Gen.<br/>
Burnside for his headquarters at it provided an excellent location to view<br/>
the ground around Fredericksburg. After the war the house continued as a<br/>
residence until 1975 when it was given to the National Park Service. The<br/>
house is available for tours and the grounds around the house offer<br/>
excellent gardens and walking areas. When we placed the letterbox, walking<br/>
the grounds was free, but there appeared to be a $4 charge to tour the<br/>
house. The walk for this letter box is less than a mile on mostly level<br/>
walkways and lawns. The last little bit has some scrambling around brush.<br/>
You might want to bring gloves as you'll be moving a few bits of broken<br/>
concrete.<br/>
<br/>
Clue:<br/>
 From the parking lot, follow the brick walk at the west end of the lot and<br/>
follow the signs leading to the "Main House"...this goes through a nice<br/>
garden.<br/>
 When you get to the door of the house marked "Visitor Entrance", turn right<br/>
and walk down the stone walkway until you get to a smaller side-house with<br/>
signs indicating "Laundry" and "Park office"<br/>
Turn left and walk through the small iron gate. Follow the walk to the large<br/>
steps leading up to the front door. <br/>
