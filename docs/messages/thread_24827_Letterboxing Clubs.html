I don't think there are really letterboxing "clubs". In certain areas there are loose groups that <br/>
get together for hikes. Try going to a local gather to meet folks in your area. I hike with a <br/>
group of ladies of a certain age,we are in the mid-atlantic region. We range from NJ,NY, PA, <br/>
DE and VA. We have all been boxing for a number of years and just kinda gravitated together.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Although the Grateful Letterboxers is a nationwide group (we'd be<br/>
international, but don't have any non-US members yet), we have a cluster of<br/>
many letterboxers in the Boston area--it's the area with the biggest<br/>
representation b/c the group started here and word of mouth is how people<br/>
find out about the group. Although initially conceived based on a shared<br/>
interest in the Grateful Dead, you needn't be interested in the Dead to join<br/>
(if you despise them, you won't be thrilled with the music we play at our<br/>
gatherings <grin>, but otherwise you are still welcome). The only<br/>
"requirements" for membership are: 1) that you are grateful for at least one<br/>
thing in your life; and 2) that you play nice with other members. At times,<br/>
someone will know they have a chance to go letterboxing and will post a<br/>
message asking if anyone can join them (this is mostly done in the Boston<br/>
area since we do have a big group here). We are having our second annual<br/>
gathering on July 12 in North Andover:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=696  Please come join<br/>
us! You do NOT need to be in the Grateful Letterboxers (GLb) group to<br/>
attend. You'll meet loads of local letterboxers--there's no better way to<br/>
find hiking buddies. If you can't make that Saturday, consider Friday night:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=703  In fact, we have<br/>
reserved some camp sites at Harold Parker State Forest, which is where the<br/>
Saturday event is, so if you are a camper, and are available, it's a<br/>
convenient way to enjoy a fun weekend.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in checking out the GLb group, visit our home page &amp;<br/>
do whatever it is you need to do to request admission. We don't screen these<br/>
requests for any exclusionary things--we just want to have an idea of who is<br/>
hooking in. http://groups.google.com/group/the-grateful-letterboxers?hl=en<br/>
(This is an open invitation to anyone reading this message--as I said, we'd<br/>
love to have people from anywhere on the globe!)<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing Events/Gatherings are by far the BEST way to meet local<br/>
letterboxers. In addition to ours in July, there are a few others to<br/>
consider:<br/>
<br/>
If you can be spontaneous <grin>, there is a gathering on Saturday (two days<br/>
from now) in Sudbury, which is a Western suburb of Boston:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=582<br/>
<br/>
Also consider the East Hartford event b/c there will be folks from MA and RI<br/>
there, no doubt: http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=681<br/>
<br/>
Although it is not until October, you will NOT want to miss Fright Night<br/>
IV!! Put it on your calendar now:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=665<br/>
<br/>
Do you use Atlas Quest? If so, read the Massachusetts board. Spontaneous<br/>
mini-meets are a fairly common event in the Boston area, and they usual<br/>
bubble up and get planned from the MA board. Also, you can search for events<br/>
through AQ.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, another option for connecting with other boxers is to email the<br/>
planter of boxes you find locally. Planters are often enthusiastic about<br/>
meeting up with letterboxers we haven't met before, and you could find a<br/>
boxing pal that way (that's what I did, and acquired several new friends,<br/>
which led to more new friends and events and now oodles of boxing friends!)<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email or AQ mail me if you want to connect and/or have any<br/>
questions.<br/>
