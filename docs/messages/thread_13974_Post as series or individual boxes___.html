I'm doing a series right now based around the Zodiac.<br/>
Each box is in a different town, but they are related,<br/>
so I'm putting Zodiac #1, 2, 3, etc., and then the<br/>
individual name. The clues all appear seperately on<br/>
the web site.<br/>

<br/>
With our on-going Camelot series, we've grouped the clues if they are <br/>
likely to be done on one hike, or mentioned the nearby ones if they <br/>
are somewhat close.  Its better than making everyone look at a map to <br/>
guess which boxes are near each other. IMHO.<br/>
