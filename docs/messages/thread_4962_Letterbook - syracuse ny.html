Dear Group:<br/>
<br/>
Per the instructions at www.leterboxing.org, the Local History/Genealogy<br/>
Dept. of the Onondaga County Public Library, is announcing  our 1st<br/>
"Letterbook" placed today to celebrate National Library Week (starting on<br/>
April 14th).<br/>
<br/>
A LETTERBOOK is an indoor variation on a letterbox. First attempted by the<br/>
Kimball Library in Randolph, Vermont, letterbooking struck the Local<br/>
History/Genealogy Department as a perfect way to entertain visitors to the<br/>
library in celebration of National Library Week. Clues are available in<br/>
person or online to help locate the OCPL letterbook.<br/>
<br/>
www.ocpl.lib.ny.us<br/>
<br/>
The hunt is on! Let the fun begin!<br/>
<br/>
Letterbook Clues<br/>
<br/>
In this library (Central Library of the Onondaga County Public Library in<br/>
downtown Syracuse, New York), is a book that has been hollowed out. Inside<br/>
the book you will find a stamp, a stamp pad and notebook. Clues, supplied<br/>
below, will enable you to determine on which floor the book is hidden, and<br/>
then to discover the book itself.<br/>
<br/>
1. If it's reality you're looking for, come visit us here, on this floor.<br/>
<br/>
2. With liquid thoughts, powered by stubborn "engines," our travels took<br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
3. East to west, through local towns, they traveled not on solid ground.<br/>
<br/>
4. From lower to higher and back again, this device a hand did lend.<br/>
<br/>
5. Both thermometers and stocks, both emotions and tides; this common<br/>
thread cannot hide.<br/>
<br/>
6. In song as children we sang this ditty, now heads go down or it will be<br/>
a pity.<br/>
<br/>
Please note: Treasure hunters are asked to be discreet and not disturb<br/>
other library patrons. You may wish to use CoolCat, the library's<br/>
computerized catalog, or ask a librarian for help in locating specific<br/>
books.<br/>
<br/>
Hurrah! Congratulations! You have found the OCPL letterbook!<br/>
<br/>
Please sign the notebook found in our letterbook and include the date and<br/>
time the letterbook was found. If you have your own personal stamp, please<br/>
stamp our notebook too. If you have your own notebook, you will want to<br/>
stamp your book with our stamp hidden inside the book. This could be the<br/>
first of many future letterbooks. Watch our Web site for details.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for participating. We hope you enjoyed the hunt.<br/>
