came home, took nap). He came hope completely encrusted with snow, and <br/>
his braid was frozen. Tomorrow we're looking forward to some long <br/>
trails up in the Northeast hills (what I was napping in preparation <br/>
for). :)  Gotta love winter in New England!!<br/>

&gt;snow is nice and white but its making me blue theirs so much we want to do <br/>
&gt;but can't because of the weather.Just like a line from a old Meatloaf <br/>
&gt;song,I'm all revved up with no place to go.I have a feeling that the web <br/>
&gt;master will be very very busy come spring.Lenny/Kathy the NeeDeeps.<br/>
