Washington County<br/>
Springdale, UT<br/>

Clues:<br/>
Follow the road to the Grotto. Take the West Rim Trail to Angel's <br/>
Landing. Once you pass through Walter's Wiggles, you are almost <br/>
there. <br/>
At the West Rim Trail sign (Angel's Landing 0.5, West Rim Spring 3.0)<br/>
take 30 steps toward Angel's Landing. A pine will be on your left. <br/>
Take 20 more steps and on your left is a boulder that looks out of <br/>
place among the red rocks. <br/>
In a crevice underneath this boulder hidden by other rocks is what <br/>
you seek.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend continuing on to Angel's Landing. The views are <br/>
fantastic. However, this last half a mile is not for those afraid of <br/>
heights! <br/>
The hike to the letterbox is approximately 2 miles with about 1000 <br/>
feet elevation gain. <br/>
<br/>
Please be very discreet and read the waiver of responsibility and <br/>
liability.  This is a very high traffic area in the summer and I <br/>
would recommend that you hunt for the letterbox in the early spring, <br/>
late fall or winter instead.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
