                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found a set of 3 round boxes at Safeway (Northern Virginia) on sale <br/>
with Safeway card for $1.99 for the set. They are heavy duty plastic, <br/>
air and water tight, safe for freezer, dishwasher and microwave (that <br/>
covers hot, cold and wet). The largest would make a slightly small <br/>
letterbox - but it can easily hold a 3"x3" log book along with stamp, <br/>
etc. I figure the smaller sizes could be used for miniboxes. The <br/>
smallest could even be used to hold a stamp within a larger box. <br/>
<br/>
The set consists of the following round boxes (measurements are <br/>
interior):<br/>
<br/>
(1) 4.5" across, 2.1" deep<br/>
<br/>
(1) 3.5" across, 1.75" deep<br/>
<br/>
(1) 2.5" across, 1.25 deep<br/>
<br/>
There were several other sets with different size containers. One set <br/>
did have a couple rectagular boxes that would work as well, but the <br/>
rest of the set was too large.<br/>
<br/>
The closing mechanism is different than Tupperware or Rubbermaid. <br/>
There are four hinged tabs on the lid that click over protrusions on <br/>
the edge of the box. The brand is Lock &amp; Lock and you can see them <br/>
online at the following site, but they are much more expensive here:<br/>

I have boxes, carving material (Enough for at least 100 stamps! I <br/>
have to try all the types right?), 6 stamps carved, plans for 3 <br/>
series, I've planned the parks where I want to place them. Now all I <br/>
need to do is make some log books, and get out and plant the boxes!! <br/>
My goal is to get one out sometime before Christmas. :)<br/>
