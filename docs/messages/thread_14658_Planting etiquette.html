I have an etiquette question. A month or so ago someone <br/>
posted that they were tired of researching an area, <br/>
writing clues, and planting a box only to have another <br/>
box appear nearby. They said they were losing interest <br/>
because there was so much emphasis on numbers. Sorry I <br/>
can't find the exact post -- this does not refer to the <br/>
post about a box being planted in the same park as a <br/>
mystery box.<br/>
<br/>
I know "there are no rules" but I'd like to know <br/>
generally how people feel about this topic. I'd hate <br/>
to step on someone's toes, so to speak. Do you feel <br/>
that the first one to plant in a park has dibs on the <br/>
park, on that section of the park or only for that <br/>
hiding place? As a planter, does it bother you when <br/>
someone plants close to you, or are you glad because <br/>
more hunters might be drawn to the area. <br/>
<br/>
If you plant in the same park as someone else, do you <br/>
reference their box in your clues?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input. <br/>

Ok, so I'm not that close to getting these boxes out <br/>
even though I have nearly a dozen stamps carved and <br/>
all the supplies. But I'm thinking about it a lot.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Aaah Mahjong, what a question! The very thing happened with our first<br/>
box and I was shocked to find someone had not only beat us but beat us<br/>
with 6 boxes to our lonesome one!!! LOL  Well, it's a big park with a<br/>
lot of trails and we will probably add to our singular little box<br/>
someday, but really, the area where we live is so barren that the more<br/>
we have the better off we are. So once the initial surprise wore off I<br/>
was delighted and we ran out at the first chance to stamp in. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I personally wouldn't mention any connection to any other boxes except<br/>
my own. I figure it is up to the person who is researching local boxes<br/>
to find them all. <br/>
<br/>
I don't think anyone has 'dibs' on a park, but if I discovered I had<br/>
placed my box very close to someone else's, then I would move mine.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as numbers go, I guess when mine get into something impressive<br/>
then maybe I'll post them, but I'm not focused on it and I KNOW I'll<br/>
never make 500 not to mention 3000! :-))<br/>

I tend to be pretty happy go lucky about letterboxing and life in general<br/>
and don't mind if someone plants a box near mine or uses my boxes as a<br/>
reference point or mentions their existence in their clues. In fact I think<br/>
it increases the likelihood that my box will get visitors! I have mentioned<br/>
other boxes in my clues with some of Franzsolo's boxes and never thought<br/>
that he might not want that done (since he's done that in his clues with my<br/>
boxes).<br/>
I have a hard time understanding why people get so bent out of shape over<br/>
little things that they perceive to be huge. Any one of us could meet our<br/>
end this afternoon or end up fighting for our lives and then worrying about<br/>
whether or not a letterbox is placed near one of ours seems so trivial. Just<br/>
live and let live and keep things in perspective. If you are wondering about<br/>
the importance of a matter, ask yourself "Would this be important if I were<br/>
fighting for my life or only had a short time to live". I'm not trying to be<br/>
morbid, just trying to keep things in perspective. Someone will probably end<br/>
up taking offense at my words, but oh well, I guess if they want to look for<br/>
things in life to take offense to, that's their right. I try to look for<br/>
things to be happy about instead.<br/>
<br/>
Get out there and really enjoy the time you have on this earth, it's too<br/>
short as it is.  :-)<br/>
