                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi to all! Just an update for everyone-- I checked on some of my <br/>
boxes yesterday and four of them are missing, unfortunately. From my <br/>
observatons, I think Hin Mallets and You Take the High Road, I'll <br/>
Take the Low Road have become victims of park restructuring and <br/>
improvements--in both cases, the actual landscape where they were <br/>
hidden is completely  gone. It was like the places never existed--<br/>
very weird feeling. Then I checked on Yoctangee Baden and Bearfoot in <br/>
the Park , both of which are also gone. Bearfoot's hiding place was <br/>
not so obvious when it was placed but with warmer weather comes much <br/>
more park use and trimming, mowing, etc. I'm guessing that kids or <br/>
non-letterboxers found Bearfoot and Baden and just didn't put them <br/>
back. At any rate, I will be replacing Bearfoot in the Park and Hin <br/>
Mallets in new locations with revised clues posted in the near <br/>
future. Yoctangee Baden's future is up in the air still, and <br/>
unfortunately, High Road will not be replaced. My apologies to <br/>
WilloWanderers, who went on quite a wild goose chase looking for <br/>
them, and a big Thank-you to Scoutdogs, WillowWanderers and to BigGuy <br/>
and family for their input! Happy boxing, Salamander.<br/>
