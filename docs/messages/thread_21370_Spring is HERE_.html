<br/>
I'm sorry for the cross posting, but I'm not sure how to get around it these days so many only subbing to regional lists and so many others(like me) to ALL of them.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the generous offer of some really great boxers in the area, The 1st Annual Hudson Valley Letterbox gathering is a go.<br/>
<br/>
When: Saturday 14 May 2005  Noon to Dusk<br/>
Where: Bowdoin Park, Wappingers Falls, NY Pavilion #4 over looking the beautiful Hudson River 15 minutes from the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge.<br/>
Theme: Spring is HERE!<br/>
<br/>
The park is wide open for letterboxes with 301 acres of well maintained trails totaling just a little over 3 miles.  <br/>
<br/>
The theme is Spring is HERE!... What does spring mean to you?  Is it purple crocus poking their heads through the snow?  A field of daffy-dills? Easter bonnets or a muddy hikes?  Create a stamp of your favorite thing about spring and send it along with a log book (we provide the box) and it will become part of a permanent Spring is HERE! series in the park.<br/>
<br/>
Hamburgers, hot dogs and buns will be provided, the rest will be pot luck.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like to attend, let us know how many to expect, if you'll be sending a stamp and what you'd like to bring to the pot-luck and if you are open to suggestions from our "we need" list!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear from you soon,<br/>
