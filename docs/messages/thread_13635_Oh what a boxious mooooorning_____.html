Well, today is the best day The Alphabet Bandits have had thus far.  2 mothers, 7 kids and 5 boxes.  We've completed the 5 required boxes to get our Connecticut State Forests Centennial Patch.!!!! <br/>
<br/>
The Mattatuck and Nassahegon State Forest boxes were in great shape, although, the path from the trail to the box in Nassahegon is some tough going.  I can't imagine attempting that box in the height of Summer.  Come late July early August, the path will be too overgrown to tackle.  I'm not even sure I'd recognize the clues.  I don't think you'll be able to see the triple tree stumps from the trail in a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
We also found the Horse of Another Color HH... our very first! YEAH!!!!  It'll probably get passed on when we go back out on Thursday.<br/>
<br/>
The Outside baggies at American Legion, People's and Tunxis State Forest all need to be replaced... I usually have extras, but in our rush to get and early start, we left them home.<br/>
<br/>
The view from Turkey Vulture Ledge was beautiful.  The box had been found by a hiker, who asked for extra info... I left a note and the web address, hopefully, he'll get back up there.  I'm going to start carrying mini info sheets to place in boxes just in case.<br/>
<br/>
We're hoping to make the first of our Alphabet Series Plants this week.  Pray the weather holds out for us... we've attempted to scope out our site a few times, but the weather has been less than ideal for traipsing in the woods in the Hudson Valley.  Send good thoughts!!!<br/>
