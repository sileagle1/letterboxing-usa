making sure the paper is on the pink stuff.<br/>

Microsoft Photo Editor is a bit hidden but can be found at:<br/>
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\PhotoEd\photoed.exe<br/>
<br/>
A lot of systems default to MSPaint or Windows Picture and FAX viewer.  <br/>
That can be changed in Windows Explorer, TOOLS..... FOLDER OPTIONS..... <br/>
FILE TYPES.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure a lot of people out there have other picture editors but MS <br/>
PAint and MS Photo Editor seem to be sufficient for me.<br/>

a college campus.  Mine is Chartpak brand -- many pens are <br/>
called "blender" pens, but not all are xylene, which is the only <br/>
kind I've found that works (it has a distictive smell like an old-<br/>
timey magic marker).  Print your art on a laser printer or xerox <br/>
machine (an ink jet printer will NOT work), tape it upside down onto <br/>
your carving medium, and go over the whole thing with the xylene in <br/>
broad strokes.  Let it dry for a few minutes, then repeat about two <br/>
times.  It's important to let it dry in between, otherwise the stamp <br/>
gets too wet and the ink smudges.  My experience is that the xylene <br/>
gives me a crisper image than acetone.<br/>

  Di, et. al.<br/>
<br/>
  Microsoft Photo Editor is a bit hidden but can be found at:<br/>
  C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\PhotoEd\photoed.exe<br/>
<br/>
  A lot of systems default to MSPaint or Windows Picture and FAX viewer.  <br/>
  That can be changed in Windows Explorer, TOOLS..... FOLDER OPTIONS..... <br/>
  FILE TYPES.<br/>
<br/>
  I'm sure a lot of people out there have other picture editors but MS <br/>
  PAint and MS Photo Editor seem to be sufficient for me.<br/>

Aha, an acetone convert. You will find that even when you do not use <br/>
the acetone transfer method, and use the pencil/transfer, you will <br/>
get better results if you scrub the stamp material with acetone  <br/>
prior to using the pencil transfer. The image will be much clearer. <br/>
I get my acetone at the hardware store and it might be a tad cheaper <br/>
there than an artist supply store.<br/>

 &gt; I just found out that Microsoft Photo editor has a "Stamp" function<br/>
 &gt; that will turn any photo into a ready to print transfer.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; http://danegood.freewebsitehosting.com/Dan/LBoxing1.htm<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; I have done the HB pencil and that work "OK" but difficult to "pencil<br/>
 &gt; in." I've tried the nail polish remover on a injet printout and it<br/>
 &gt; did NOT transfer. I have yet to try it using a laserjet. Is there any<br/>
 &gt; other methods that you use?<br/>
 &gt;<br/>

<br/>
I have tried actually using an inkjet printer and printing directly to<br/>
tracing paper, and then rubbing the image onto the carving matierial.<br/>
It seems to work pretty well.  I don't always get a perfectly clear<br/>
image, but it is enough that I can figure the rest out as I am carving.<br/>
