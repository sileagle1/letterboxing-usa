consider moderating the posts of gingerbreadjunk. It is obvious that <br/>
this person is goading others with incendiary language and personal <br/>
attacks. It is also obvious that the opinions of others, whether shared <br/>
by other newcomers or those who are long-time letterboxers, are not <br/>
being heard and valued by this person. He is not interested in <br/>
collaberating or respecting the well-intentioned thoughts of those who <br/>
have a great deal more experience. Rather, he is more invested in <br/>
arguing and listening to his own inflammatory rhetoric and being <br/>
offensive. As a long time member of this list, I am asking for some <br/>
kind of intervention from the Moderators in order to restore peace <br/>
here. Thank you.<br/>

&gt; Gee, why is it that some things/people are inappropriate but others <br/>

&gt; Why is gingerbreadjunk allowed to tell people to shut up, berate the <br/>
&gt; owner of the HH in question and demean another member here, <br/>
&gt; demanding they be "put in their place", but few people call him on <br/>
&gt; it, but here we are jumping all over someone who gives him right <br/>
