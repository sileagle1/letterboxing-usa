Please, if you have any stamps you would like added to our tree, send them to us! (contact me off list for our address jarsofclaylb@yahoo.com) If you want them back after the fact no problem because we'll be logging all stamps and carvers.  We'll be sending them back after we take the tree down in January, just include a self addressed envelope when you mail the stamps. <br/>
<br/>
The tree will be going up just after thanksgiving and we'll be accepting stamps right along until Christmas day.  The tree will remain until 2 weeks after the new year so that everyone will get a chance to stamp as many as possible. <br/>

Watch for the new post for our second annual merry letterboxing Christmas tree.<br/>
