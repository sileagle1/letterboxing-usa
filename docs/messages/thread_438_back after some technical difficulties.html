                    <div class="plaintext-content">i've been absent from the list for about 10 days.  that's because<br/>
my browser was reconnecting to the internet without my knowledge.<br/>
it ran my account hours beyond the maximum allowed (for the month<br/>
of April) so i was unable to use the account at all until May 1st.<br/>
alas, back in business... today is May 1st.<br/>
looks like the list has been fairly quiet.<br/>
<br/>
I should mention Randy Hall (PA) is now helping with the web<br/>
publishing and that i appreciate it very much, esp. the work<br/>
on clues which i had mostly done myself before.  thanks<br/>
Randy!<br/>
<br/>
also, it looks like somebody has streamlined the masthead.  it looks<br/>
nice.  see http://www.pclink.com/elf/<br/>
I assume it was either Mitch or Michelle or both.  Thank you<br/>
to whoever did it.  Also, that whole image at the top of the main<br/>
page is a link to the input form http://www.pclink.com/elf/inform.htm,<br/>
good idea again, to whoever set it up that way.<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 or 3 contacts lined up to do sheets of rubber for a fairly<br/>
reasonable price.  I think this will come more into play when<br/>
more people are involved because you need about 15 to 20 images<br/>
to fill up a sheet.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's about all for now.<br/>
Take care all.  Thanks to those of you are gearing toward 50 by Y2K.<br/>
I'm working on Minnesota letterbox #4 right now.  It will be a <br/>
baseball theme stamp and it will be hidden right here on my own block<br/>
in the tutti-frutti clamp-type jar ala Deborah of Madison, WI.<br/>
