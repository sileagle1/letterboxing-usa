&gt;&gt;You really are a  very talented designer and carver *understatement* &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank-You <blushing> (&amp; thank you to all the others who have said so as<br/>
well)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; Got a question: how do you manage to get the rubber out of the hole in<br/>
the needle? Do you grind the top side of the needle off &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
The needles have a very long tip and don't need to go deep enough to get<br/>
rubber in the tip. They aren't used like typical carving tools, instead,<br/>
they are used like a very tiny knife.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Next step I think is a magnifier to pull down over my eyes.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
A magnifier is the ONLY way to carve! I can't carve without mine now :-) (&amp;<br/>
my eyesight is fine) It really does make a HUGE difference! You'll love it<br/>
and wonder how you ever carved without one.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;I shall try to have some of the needles with me at the October 4th SLO<br/>
Stamping in the Meadow&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Sure wish I could make it all the way out to California, but alas, no money.<br/>
:-( I wish you perfect weather, a grand turn out and all boxes found by the<br/>
seekers.<br/>

P.S. Did you get the message I sent you about Dog Scouts &amp; the other answers<br/>
to your questions?<br/>
