Oconee County<br/>
Nearest City: Walhalla<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:<br/>
Clues: easy<br/>
Trail is an easy walk after a bit of scrambling to get<br/>
on top of the tunnel<br/>
Total loop from car park is less than one-half mile.<br/>
<br/>
Notes about the Stumphouse Tunnel:<br/>
In 1852, the South Carolina Legislature granted a<br/>
charter to the Blue Ridge Railroad Company, which was<br/>
formed to build a railroad connection between<br/>
Charleston, South Carolina, and Knoxville, Tennessee. <br/>
The major obstacle to this work was Stumphouse<br/>
Mountain in Oconee County, South Carolina.  Stumphouse<br/>
Tunnel was to be constructed 5,863 feet through solid<br/>
granite.<br/>
<br/>
In spite of the dreams of the people of Charleston,<br/>
considerable effort on the part of many people of the<br/>
state, and sizable expenditures, the railroad across<br/>
the mountains was not meant to be.  The South Carolina<br/>
Legislature refused to grant further funding to the<br/>
railroad in 1859, ending South Carolina's western<br/>
connection.<br/>
<br/>
All that remains of the grandiose dream is the<br/>
unfinished Stumphouse Tunnel now preserved in a park<br/>
located in the foothills a few miles north of Walhalla<br/>
on Highway 28.  Picnic tables are available.<br/>
<br/>
Today, the tunnel area is a recreational site.  The<br/>
temperature inside the tunnel is about 50 degrees and<br/>
the humidity is about 85% year-around.  Youll want to<br/>
bring flashlights to explore the tunnel, into which<br/>
you may venture for quite a distance.  Shortly after<br/>
entering the tunnel, you will come to the first<br/>
ventilation shaft, which opens up to the sky far<br/>
above.  For a more detailed history of the tunnel,<br/>
visit www.stumphousetunnel.com.<br/>
<br/>
The clues:<br/>
Across from the entrance to the tunnel is a rail car. <br/>
Standing at the rail car and facing the tunnel you<br/>
will notice that there are trails on either side of<br/>
the tunnel that lead to the area above the tunnel. <br/>
You may take either the left or right paths, but I<br/>
took both and found the right to be somewhat easier. <br/>
Standing at the front of the rail car, youll find the<br/>
right-hand path at about 30.<br/>
<br/>
After climbing up the trail, you will soon find<br/>
yourself on a rocky plateau above the tunnel opening<br/>
and can look down to the rail car and the car park. <br/>
Turn to face 350 and you will see a trail leading<br/>
into the woods.  Follow this trail.  You should see<br/>
overhead wires to your right, and a guy wire for one<br/>
of the supporting poles is anchored in the path about<br/>
15 paces in.<br/>
<br/>
You will soon come to a broken tree sticking out of<br/>
the ground in the middle of the trail.  The stump of<br/>
the tree points to 45 and leans over at about the<br/>
same number of degrees.  Continue up the trail about<br/>
43 paces, crossing another bigger log across the path<br/>
as you go.  Then look to your right (east) about five<br/>
paces off the trail to see a fallen tree with its<br/>
roots pulled out of the ground.  On the other side of<br/>
this tree, at the base of the trunk under a rock, you<br/>
will find that which you seek.  Use discretion when<br/>
stamping up, as this trail is a popular one.<br/>
<br/>
You may carry on up the path another 145 paces or so<br/>
to find the top of the tunnels first ventilation<br/>
shaft.  Only the bats should use this entrance, so it<br/>
is surrounded by chain-link fence.<br/>
