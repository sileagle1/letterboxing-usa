ivy story-I have poison ivy on my butt!!<br/>
<br/>
DH and I checked letterboxes a few weeks ago, and somehow I got <br/>
poison ivy on my butt! I walked through a bunch (DH kindly pointed it <br/>
out AFTER i walked through it!) but sat down only twice to open boxes <br/>
and read logbooks-on the boardwalk. So how the HECK did I get it <br/>
THERE?!<br/>
<br/>
It's a really ugly batch-we went to the beach last weekend and i wore <br/>
shorts because my bathing suit wouldn't cover it all. I didn't want <br/>
people to think I had some kind of freaky butt disease.<br/>
<br/>
My only solace is that DH has it worse-all over his legs and feet (he <br/>
wore sandals). His is a bigger area, but mine is more, ahem, <br/>
sensitive!<br/>

Either you like to letterbox naked or you forgot your TP. Okay, you <br/>
like to hike in short shorts, and since you forget to pay attention <br/>
to the vegetation as you were seriously looking for that must have <br/>
letterbox you brushed up against some lush looking poison ivy.;o<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, if someone is burning poison ivy and you happen to inhale <br/>
the smoke or fumes you can get poison ivy. <br/>
<br/>
Just remember,never to scratch you butt until you have clean hands.<br/>
And that not every interesting hiding spot for a letterbox is ideal.<br/>
