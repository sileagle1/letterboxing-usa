<p><br/><br/>At the risk of beating a dead horse...I'll put in my two cents and leave it <br/>at that.<br/><br/>First...this is a hobby...It is meant to be fun, that is why there are <br/>really no rules...so if someone likes placing a hitchhiker...Good for them.<br/><br/>Second...for those who do not like hitchhikers...who says you have to pick <br/>them up...leave them for the next person...live and let live...someone else <br/>is having fun...you do you want to ruin it for them.<br/><br/>Third...Did anyone ever think that someone has a reason for making a <br/>hitchhiker?  I made one to commerate a deceased pet who was very well known <br/>around my area.  I used the stamp that was her "signature" knowing that she <br/>enjoyed traveling around and haming it up for the audiences...that meant <br/>something to me.  It bothers me when you disparage my work.<br/><br/>Finally...I guess what I'm trying to say to the naysayers out there is...Get <br/>A Life!!!  Remember that this is a strictly volunteer effort...no one gets <br/>paid to place boxes...and the only thing that the disgruntled ones are doing <br/>is ruining it for everyone else.<br/><br/>I'm sure that the naysayers are going to attack me for my comments...but <br/>I'll continue to place a hitchhiker when I feel that it is appropriate.<br/><br/>Yours in Letterboxing<br/>Magic Mike<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>_________________________________________________________________<br/>MSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE* <br/><a href="http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus</a><br/><br/><br/></p><br/><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
