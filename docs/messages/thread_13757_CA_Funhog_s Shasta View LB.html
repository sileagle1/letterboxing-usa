find! Alas, after looking for 40 minutes, we tromped down the dusty trail <br/>
stamp-less! The good news though, was it was the Summer Solstice, on Mt. Shasta and <br/>
it was a beautiful day! Can't get better than that!<br/>
<br/>
We were at a 3-day quilting retreat and took a break to find the letterbox, <br/>
looked under every rock and around every Ponderosa, got all scratched up in the <br/>
process by manzanita (but not the "lone" one, wherever that was!) to come up <br/>
empty-handed.<br/>
<br/>
So, is it still there or are we miserably bad 'boxers'?<br/>

I'm sure that it is still there.  It's further along the trail than <br/>
one might think.  It would be quite bizarre if it were missing.  I <br/>
do recall, however, that the lone ponderosa/tree in the clues (I <br/>
believe) was cut down by Christmas tree hunters last winter.  I <br/>
think I remember Funhog saying she had to alter the clues to reflect <br/>
the missing little tree.<br/>
