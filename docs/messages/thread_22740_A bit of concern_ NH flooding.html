about 20-30 feet under water currently the entire beach area is submerged &amp; <br/>
considering the items washed down by the Dam..TV, computers etc it is proberbly <br/>
gone....Also We tried to find Stone arch Bridge in stoddard on our way somewhere &amp; <br/>
it appears to be gone as well,The bridge it self was considerably <br/>
damaged..caving in &amp; no longer able to be walked on..<br/>
I have not gone to confirm but I believe the 3- I planted at Goose pond in <br/>
Keene, are at great risk of having been washed away...Also Ashulet river park ( <br/>
I can check this one Tuesday) in Keene &amp; Granite Gorge, Chesterfield..both <br/>
these areas suffered major flooding &amp; the box at Ashulet could have possibly <br/>
washed away, the gorge, one box may have been tucked away well enough but one has <br/>
a good chance of having been washed away, also Backwards Covered Bridge in <br/>
Swanzey( I can check this, this week as well), right close to the bank of the <br/>
river &amp; could be gone once the waters swelled &amp; rushed thru...<br/>
<br/>
 I hope to check on the ones I planted &amp; the ones I have already done, <br/>
because I'll know where they are or should have been for sure....then contact the <br/>
placer so they could put a disclaimer on the clues..<br/>
<br/>
As a courtesy to placers, I think it's fair to ask locals to check these <br/>
boxes...many being placed by out of state placers.....As much as we want to find <br/>
one everytime, their effort in placing &amp; writing clues, warrents help in <br/>
checking on lost boxes...or planning a day when you just go out to give first aid to <br/>
all damaged boxes....<br/>
<br/>
I know on my own boxes some were covered under heavy rocks but if you live up <br/>
here &amp; drive around you see the power of the water..moving houses,trees etc. <br/>
frankly if you've never been to these certain places you would come &amp; truely <br/>
not believe houses or roads were ever there....so no rock is heavey enough to <br/>
secure a letterbox<br/>
