spent about an hour looking for the "Rock of Racial Harmony" LB, with<br/>

it in late August.  Our hardest part was finding the actual rock. <br/>
Once that was located, the rest fell into place.  Met some great folks<br/>
who had never heard about letterboxing and were quite intrigued.  They<br/>
helped us locate the rock in question.<br/>
