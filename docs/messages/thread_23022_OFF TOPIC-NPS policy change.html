                    <div class="plaintext-content">The NPS has created a new Draft policy that will take the Wild out <br/>
of Wilderness.<br/>
Comments on this new policy are being received until February 18th <br/>
and the draft policies can be found at:<br/>
 http://parkplanning.nps.gov/document.cfm?<br/>
Projected=13746&amp;documented=12825<br/>
<br/>
Under new policies wilderness could be managed for intensive <br/>
commercial recreation, scientific uses and special events. <br/>
Emphasizes visitor safety as a major goal and allows development of <br/>
wilderness. Trail developments, signs, toilets, developed campsites, <br/>
picnic areas, and other civilized construction will be created.<br/>
While there may be allowances for such things as letterboxing and <br/>
geocaching, changing the scope of NPS from protection of the <br/>
qualities of the wilderness to increasing the non wilderness <br/>
qualities is just wrong. I certainly don't want to float down the <br/>
Grand Canyon and stop at a Burger King. Your reactions can be sent <br/>
