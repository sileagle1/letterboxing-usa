                    <div class="plaintext-content">Letterboxes get archived by placers or webmasters. Placers <br/>
usually archive letterboxes when the letterboxes are <br/>
retired or missing. Webmasters sometimes archive <br/>
letterboxes when they appear to be abandoned, that is, <br/>
when contact email to a placer is returned as <br/>
undeliverable and the member hasn't logged into LbNA for <br/>
over a year. Archived letterboxes are accessible through <br/>
the LbNA Basement link on the LbNA home page and also <br/>
appear in the placer's Member Services page. Placers can <br/>
"unarchive: letterboxes at any time. It does not mean that <br/>
the letterbox is definitely missing.<br/>
