                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all of my next door letterboxing neighbors in Wisconsin. This is Gooble Gobble from Mn. I'm taking a two day letterboxing trip and I'll be spending most of those two days in Wisconsin. I was wondering if anyone could recommend some great boxes not to miss, or great series as well. Here's my criteria. 1.I'm pretty short on cash, so no boxes in places that I have to pay to get into (State parks, etc.) 2. Short hike times, the mission I'm on is to visit as many boxes as I can in two days.So the time from car to box back to car should be no longer than 45 minutes. 3.I'm crossing ionto Wisconsin near Onalaska on 90, then onto Madison. Sun Prairie is the farthest I'm going west and I'll be taking I-90 back home to Mn. I realize that I have a lot of restrictions on me, So any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated. If any of you are going to be visiting Mn. to go boxing anytime soon let me know, I could return the favor and give you the same type of info. Thanks a bunch.<br/>

Oh yeah, can anyone recommend a clean,cheap campground somewhere between Madison and the Dells? I've got a new tent I've been wanting to use.<br/>
