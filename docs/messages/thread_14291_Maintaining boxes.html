the "old" site out, and renaming the *.wesgarrison.us site so that <br/>
when you click on www.letterboxing.org, it accesses the site that Wes <br/>
re-vamped.  I'm sure you could privately email Wes for a more  <br/>
succinct explanation! <br/>

&gt; will soon be <br/>
&gt; deleted from the site, I'm curious. I hear a lot of talk on <br/>
&gt; maintain the box. How <br/>
&gt; often should a box you plant be checked on? Is there any <br/>
&gt; rules for this or <br/>
&gt; guidelines on maintaining a box?  <br/>
<br/>
No rules. Generally I check on my boxes if I'm in the area or if I hear<br/>
there is a problem. Probably every 3-6 months otherwise. I always enjoy<br/>
getting emails from people visiting my boxes - and it helps if they say how<br/>
the box is getting on. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Has anyone tried putting a note to the owner in the box about <br/>
&gt; the abandoned <br/>
&gt; box situation that's going on as well as emailing the <br/>
&gt; individual?  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are a huge number of emails circulating the internet as we try<br/>
and track down owners. A lot of folk were having problems registering with<br/>
the site and so now that we know we can help them out. I'm encouraging<br/>
potential adopters to go visit the box and see if there are contact details<br/>
in the log book. I would greatly encourage anyone who ends up adopting a box<br/>
to leave a note in the box for the box owner too.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Does anyone <br/>
&gt; know how long the webmasters are giving before the clues <br/>
&gt; disappear from the <br/>
&gt; site? <br/>
<br/>
No set date as far as I know. We're doing our best to make sure no box<br/>
remains abandoned. Everyone can help with this by tracking down owners in<br/>
their area (a new form of letterboxing perhaps where we find the boxer<br/>
rather than the box??). <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Also can someone tell me the difference between the <a <br="">
&gt; HREF="www.letterboxing.org"&gt;www.letterboxing.org</a> site <br/>
&gt; and the letterboxing.wesgarrison.us site. <br/>
<br/>
The latter was the temporary site address for the new website while it was<br/>
under construction. It has now been transferred over to the original site<br/>
(letterboxing.org) and the old one is now under http://www.rpmrlm.com:1020/.<br/>
So www.letterboxing.org is the one to use.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps some,<br/>
