Vancouver, BC and have a slew of LB firsts to report:<br/>
<br/>
1) Found our first non-OR box: Fish Head (found Fish Tail too)<br/>
2) Found our first HH: Scaredy Cat (in the Fish Tail box)<br/>
3) Planted our first non-OR box: Alaska Souvenir Box (in Juneau: <br/>
clues to be posted soon)<br/>
4) Found our first non-USA box: Suspension Bridge in Lynn Canyon <br/>
Series<br/>
<br/>
Scardey Cat certainly had a good reason to be scared, seeing how <br/>
Washington has no hitchhiking signs posted about every seven <br/>
feet. :) Scardey Cat visited our Alaska box, but didn't stay, being <br/>
too afraid of being cold and lonely over the off season.<br/>
<br/>
We were unable to look for the recently placed SE Alaska boxes even <br/>
though we were in Juneau and Ketchikan due to being limited to <br/>
walking since Grace was without her car seat. Note to LBers in/going <br/>
to Ketchikan. The city park near the fish hatchery is begging for <br/>
letterboxes. We had already planted the only box we brought and <br/>
aren't adept enough to even consider "field" carving, so it remains <br/>
empty.<br/>
<br/>
We were unable to find the Loon of Lynn Canyon Series. It is <br/>
possibly missing. Ryan, I have pictures of where we think it is/was <br/>
and will email to you soon so you can possibly confirm.<br/>
<br/>
Lynn Canyon is a wonderful park. Everyone should visit it if they <br/>
have a chance, even if not letterboxing.<br/>
