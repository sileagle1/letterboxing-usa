I loved Bartholemew's Cobble, and I would also like to go back for the wild flowers.  I was there in the fall and the ferns were very spectacular. I hope to get down to the Hudson Valley to find the others you mentioned in Kingston and at Vanderbil Mansion. Have you thought of Taconic State Park as a "planting ground"? It is very beautiful and large, and not too far for me to come and find your boxes!Claire<br/>

Wonderful! All three stamps intact!<br/>

It was raining real hard but I let my umbrella be my compass!  Stamps <br/>
were dry and intact! I loved the clues for this one. <br/>
<br/>
Bartholemew's Cobble Ashley Falls MA:<br/>

Still raining, but left the umbrella in the car.  Found a great tree <br/>
for shelter.  Low and behold a HH; another first!!!  Devilish <br/>
Dragonflies has moved onward into the state of NY.  I may go back to <br/>
this to see the wild flowers.  I was a bit early for the season.<br/>

Well, as long as I am mentioning firsts...my first non-find!  How <br/>
about that! I am not discouraged though and shall return!<br/>

<br/>
That's right Devilish Dragonflies, you're living high on the hog <br/>
now!! A view of the Hudson from the east side looking west. <br/>
<br/>
  The Vanderbilt LB will always be special for me because of the fox <br/>
I saw on the trail.  She stopped and looked at me and then went on <br/>
her way...She went to her brood as I heard them on the other side of <br/>
the ledge. She was big for a fox and seemed to me she has seen many <br/>
years!<br/>
<br/>
  I am working on a couple of plants for the Hudson Valley in NY. Is <br/>
there anyone willing to guide a newbie?<br/>
