<br/>
Am pleased to report that The Wall letterbox is still<br/>
secure and in place in Waterford!  Chip, what a great<br/>
idea with the dialog - very nice.  The box did give me<br/>
fits for a while - spent about 30 minutes hunting the<br/>
wall for it!  There were so many stones to look under<br/>
(through) I was overwhelmed. Found it in the end -<br/>
joy!  I do have one question though - maybe you can<br/>
answer off list if you don't want to give it away?<br/>
What exactly is two chains (what does it mean?) Is it<br/>
a unit of measure and if so, how do you know what the<br/>
original length is? This part of the clue was<br/>
perplexing (good) which made it even more of a high<br/>
when i got it!!Thanks again.<br/>

HAD NOT LIVED AT ALL!"<br/>
