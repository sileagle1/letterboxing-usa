the 21 musicals with me. Well, today was the day, and hot and sweaty <br/>
we found 19, believing the Phantom to be just that and not a reality. <br/>
We also were unable to find Oklahoma but in the search we did find a <br/>
personal stamp with 3 nifty fairies flying through the air. If this <br/>
rings a bell with anyone I'll be glad to meet with you to return it.<br/>
<br/>
Chapuline and Rubaduc will be at the Ryan meet to complete our <br/>
weekend of letterboxing. Hope to see you all there.<br/>
