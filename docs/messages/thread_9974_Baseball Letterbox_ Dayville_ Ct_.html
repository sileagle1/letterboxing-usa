This is the second box in our sports series.  Growing up, I have always<br/>
loved baseball.  First watching the St. Louis Cardinals(who I'll be able<br/>
to see at Fenway this year)  in the 82 World Series, and cheering them<br/>
on ever since.  I play in softball leagues now and get together every<br/>
weekend with friends from work to go against my twin brothers work team<br/>
for the last 7yrs.  (I'll admit his team has the better record).  <br/>
Directions:  From 395north exit 93 go left park will be on the right.<br/>
395south exit 93 go right park will be on the left.  It is on rt. 101<br/>
<br/>
Pull into the first parking area on the left.  Park over by the<br/>
basketball courts.  Walk past the basketball courts to the Savings Bank<br/>
Of Manchester Pavilion.  At the 4th post on the left, take a reading of<br/>
285 degrees.  Walk up the hill to a headstone that looks like a bench.<br/>
You have a great view of the ballfield from here.  From there head north<br/>
down the hill.  Line yourself up straight across from the Community Hall<br/>
Stage.  Right behind you will be a rotten log at the edge of the woods.<br/>
Inside the log from the back is your prize.<br/>
