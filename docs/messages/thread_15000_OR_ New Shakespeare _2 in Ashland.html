This is a fill-in-the-blank puzzle. You will be directed to places with <br/>
"commemorations" and will fill in the puzzle below in the order you find the clues. <br/>
It is at this place you will find the letterbox.<br/>

Note: This is the second in a series. It begins at the place where the <br/>
Shakespeare #1 box is found. If you have found #1 in the past, please go there <br/>
again. As of August 9, 2003, the store-bought stamp has been replaced by a lovely, <br/>
hand-carved one that shouldn't be missed.<br/>
<br/>
Says Mercrucio in "Romeo and Juliet": "Nay, if our wits run the wild goose <br/>
chase, I am done." But THOU hast finished not! On to the next letterbox!<br/>
