    Even if they are straight Geocaches, I would not worry too much about<br/>
needing a GPS.<br/>
Having pretty much exhausted the nearby letterboxes, I thought I would try<br/>
some local Geocaches.<br/>
I found 18 out of 19 this week without a GPS, and barely using my compass. I<br/>
still think that one cache might be missing.<br/>
    I am not big on the Treasure Trade, but I do like the custom buttons<br/>
that many of the caches builders supply.<br/>
It is also as good as getting a stamp image!<br/>
    Remember, the first thing they tell you is EXACTLY where it is.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hi All!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It's certainly been a great few days for hunting big game in the<br/>
&gt; Columbia River Gorge!!!  John and I were able to capture three together<br/>
&gt; and he did Eagle Creek yesterday while I was at an all day class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ryan, I cannot thank you enough for placing this marvelous series.  John<br/>
&gt; has nearly all of your beautiful animal carvings and I'm feeling about<br/>
&gt; ambitious and fit enough to aspire towards getting them all eventually<br/>
&gt; -- Yes...Even Pt. Defiance and, UGH, Nesmith Point.  After nabbing two<br/>
&gt; exotic creatures in the Gorge today we attempted Multnomah Falls again.<br/>
&gt; However, it continues to perplex and elude.  We couldn't do Angel's Rest<br/>
&gt; because by the time we got there, it would have been dark coming down.<br/>
&gt; Just another safari to look forward to in the future!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS  It looks like there are some very, very active folks in Ohio placing<br/>
&gt; boxes right and left.  That's one state I've never been to, but I can<br/>
&gt; see that there is plenty of incentive to go there one of these days.<br/>
&gt; Even if some of them are geocache/Letterbox combos, I might be willing<br/>
&gt; to seek them out, anyway, as long as a GPS is not required.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Best regards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
