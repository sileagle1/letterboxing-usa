I found some of these boxes awhile back and can give you some hints. Read on<br/>
if you'd like them.<br/>
<br/>
For Pining Away, it is WAY off the trail! I know you probably can't see the<br/>
tree he uses as a marker, because it was hard to see when the trees didn't<br/>
have leaves! Once we did find it, I was a bit turned around and very glad<br/>
Franzsolo was with me to get me back to the trail :-) Also, the fallen log<br/>
is most likely covered with brush (it's not a very big log). I had to get my<br/>
hand carefully past the 'sticker' bushes to retrieve and replace the<br/>
container. I'd suggest trying this one again next Winter after everything<br/>
had died :-)<br/>
<br/>
Mound Eyes- I would not have found this without Franzsolo's help. If I<br/>
recall correctly, this is the one by the frizbee golf target (the yellow man<br/>
made object). I was shocked to see one in the middle of the woods! How do<br/>
people play frizbee golf in the woods!? There is a bit of a trail in the<br/>
corner that you have to take to see the object because of the vegetation.<br/>
<br/>
Monkey Shines is to the left of a trail marker that says "trail closed" if I<br/>
recall correctly. When we were there a big group of mountain bikers took the<br/>
trail and were visible across the 'valley/ditch' from the box location as<br/>
they followed the 'switchback' in the trail. Again, the trail marker was<br/>
partially hidden by tall weeds, so if they have not been cut since Winter,<br/>
I'm sure the sign is well hidden (or maybe the trail is open now?). It was<br/>
an opening in the woods where the trail turns to the right sharply just<br/>
after you enter the woods. Take the reading at the sharp turn (which is<br/>
where the marker is/was).<br/>
<br/>
Yoctangee Baden was pretty straight forward. I can't imagine it was<br/>
discovered accidentally, but I suppose it's possible.<br/>
<br/>
Bearfoot in the park was in a REALLY exposed location and the rocks were<br/>
obvious. It's possible that a gardener chose to move the pile of rocks and<br/>
found that one, or kids did. Too bad, it was a really cute stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Hin Mallets gave us a workout. We had gone back near where our car was<br/>
parked and then decided to try to find it. We started toward the nearest<br/>
shelter thinking that would be it (with the stairs by the pond), nope, the<br/>
coordinates were wrong and the tree wasn't right. So, we figured it was the<br/>
next shelter and walked over there, same story. This continued again and<br/>
again all the way across the park! Then we found out we had to tackle the<br/>
hill!We did manage to get it, but it was the longest walk of a very long day<br/>
(9 hours of boxin'). I can see why it would be too wet, I hope it didn't get<br/>
washed away!<br/>
<br/>
That's all the tips I have for you. Hope they help! Come down to the West<br/>
side of Cinci &amp; S.E. Ind. If you let me know when/where you'll be, maybe we<br/>
can exchange!<br/>
