<div><span class="510333203-01122002">Thank you everyone 
for your emails and asking how I'm doing. I'm doing much better and actually 
very lucky not to have broken anything. Thought it was time I got out there and 
find the "Climb Every Mountain" box today. Same box I was looking for when 
I took my fall. Chickabirdie, Molly and I went out and ended up having a very 
good trip. We found that box and finished finding all rest of the series.A few 
of them were pretty tough. We also found the new hitchhiker "The 
Duffer" which was planted by Team Green Dragon at "Calamity Jane". We think we 
were not far behind Team Green when they were up there. Thanks to an email 
tip off, we also found a extra box near the spring. Word is that there is 
still another extra box further along. Finished up just in time and got back to 
the car just before it was too dark. I had overworked a muscle I hurt 
last weekend and was supposed to take it easy but it was worth it for this 
trip. Chuck, Molly and 
Chickabirdie  </span></div></body></html>

Glad to hear your back in the saddle after such a nasty fall.  I know <br/>
what it feels like, I fell out of a hunting tree stand years ago.  <br/>
Broke three ribs and a leg.  It took me 4 hours to drag myself out of <br/>
the woods, and 3 months to heal compleatly.  Don't overwork that <br/>
muscle, those boxes will be there for you in the springtime.  You can <br/>
always use this time to make more boxes to put out.  Keep us posted.<br/>
<br/>

Hi Chuck,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the report on "The Duffer" <br/>
<br/>
We heard someone behind us, but when we checked the first box in the <br/>
series <br/>
there were no new stamps after ours, so we figured they were "Non <br/>
Boxing Types".<br/>
<br/>
All I can say after seeing the cliff @ "Climb Every Mountain" is <br/>
OUCH!!<br/>
