the longest letterbox series on my to-do list? I couldn't drum up <br/>
interest from the poolside Drew kids, so set off alone to find Pete <br/>
and Wanda's "Lil Rhody Runaround" in Burlingame RI.<br/>
<br/>
Wow! This is my version of the perfect letterbox series: excellent <br/>
and beautifully challenging trail, fun clues with an imaginative <br/>
theme that lead straight to well hidden boxes that'll last for ages. <br/>
Nice stamps too!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, soaked through and through with sweat and half-delirious <br/>
with exhaustion, I was finishing up with a "cool down" stroll and who <br/>
was happily walking towards me, looking cool as cucumbers? Pete and <br/>
Wanda!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much, P&amp;W for the great afternoon and for the <br/>
refreshingly chilled root beer and grapes! I'm admiring your stamps <br/>
right now.<br/>
