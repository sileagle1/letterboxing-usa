<br/>
Jay in exhilaratingly springy CT<br/>

<br/>
Father's Day Flowers<br/>
<br/>
Rhododendron bursts into pom poms of colorful flower in mid-June in <br/>
Connecticut, and the Pachaug Forest in Voluntown is a great place to enjoy <br/>
the show. From the intersection of CT Routes 138, 165, and 49, head north on <br/>
Rte. 49 to find the main Pachaug Forest entrance on your left. Follow the <br/>
park road in past pine forests to a large open grassy area marked as the <br/>
Mount Misery Area and park by the Rhododendron Preserve. This is an easy, <br/>
level, handicapped accessable hike over about 1/2 mile.<br/>
Hike into the Preserve on the wide, groomed trail, enjoying a wonderful <br/>
wetland area with lots of ferns and slowly moving, tannin-dark waters in <br/>
season. Just before stepping onto an extensive boardwalk, there is a slight <br/>
bit of "high" ground to protect our letterbox on your left. Take a step or <br/>
two off-trail to reach behind the mossy tulip tree for your Father's Day <br/>
reward.<br/>
