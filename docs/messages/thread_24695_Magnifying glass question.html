I think a lighted lens would be best.  I've had one for several years that I<br/>
like a LOT.  It is a Lite Source LSM-180WHT White Mag-Lite.  You can find<br/>
and other products at:  http://www.like.com/home/magnifier_lamps  although<br/>
I'm sure there are many sources.  My husband actually got mine on a<br/>
clearance sale at a local art store.  I clamp mine onto the desk where I<br/>
carve.<br/>
<br/>
I also see that there may be the same type available via ebay, even with a<br/>
rolling base (however the shipping costs seem high).  Here's what I found:<br/>

lighted lamp.  Most art supply stores will have these.  That is real  <br/>
arts supply,<br/>
not a  Michael's or AC Moore type, but a real arts supply type. Check  <br/>
the following arts supply cataogues.  I have used all of them and  <br/>
they are all reputable.<br/>
Jerry's Art A Rama<br/>
Daniel Smith<br/>
Dick Blick<br/>
ASW<br/>
Cheap Joe's Art Stuff<br/>
<br/>
I think you will find what you want at one of these places.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here is something I had to do to our lighted magnifier that had a clamp <br/>
that attached to a table. Fortunately the clamp broke. I say <br/>
fortunately as it started making little marks on the table. The clamp <br/>
was separate from the extension part of the unit so it did come off <br/>
easily. The clamp part had a pin that fit into the extension part. <br/>
I cut a 12" wide piece of pine about 20" long and mounted a bolt (the <br/>
diameter of the pin) through a 2"X4" block then attached the block with <br/>
the bolt sticking up. The extension part fits right on that bolt. I <br/>
have a portable working surface (the pine board) and base for the <br/>
lighted magnifier.<br/>
<br/>
Now I can leave little scraps of carving material scattered all over <br/>
the house.<br/>

$30, certainly, on sale.  Sits on the table, very heavy weighted base, <br/>
long articulated arm and a little "flap" on top of the lamp that opens <br/>
up to reveal the magnifier.  Love it.  Saw similar ones at the craft <br/>
store, near the needle work stuff, for three times as much $$$.  So I <br/>
highly recommend giving a look at your local office supply place. <br/>

&gt;  Hi, I had asked for a freestanding lighted magifying glass for <br/>
Christmas.<br/>
&gt; I got an OTT-Lite freestanding magnifying glass with NO light.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I am wondering if I should just keep it or return it for something <br/>
else.<br/>
&gt; The problem is that I have been pretty much unable to find what I am<br/>
&gt; imagining.<br/>
