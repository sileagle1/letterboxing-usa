Nice to hear from you. There has not been a whole lot of activity in <br/>
any state other than Connecticut/Rhode Island, where Jay Drew is <br/>
preparing to plant his 100th letterbox on New year's Day. This <br/>
reagion is really becoming the Dartmoor of North America.<br/>
<br/>
The clues for boxes placed in Florida are handled by Mitch Klink. He <br/>
is very busy as a student at the moment, and there is a backlog of <br/>
clues waiting to be posted. But send your clues to the group, and we <br/>
will hopefully get them up by the millenium.<br/>

<br/>
I have been away from letterboxing for quite sometime due to other<br/>
committments (as may be apparent from the letterboxing.com site being<br/>
down for several months). I recently received a postcard from a lady<br/>
named Pam from Oregon (don't know if she is on this list) who found two<br/>
out three letterboxes I have placed in Florida. She couldn't find the<br/>
third and I need to go out and see if it has gone missing in the course<br/>
of the bad weather we had this summer/fall (near hurricane brushes). I<br/>
went to the letterboxing.org site today in the hopes that perhaps there<br/>
were new letterboxes in Florida besides my own. Alas, it does not<br/>
appear to be the case. Anyone out there going to place some boxes in<br/>
Florida? I sure would like to search for some besides my own ;-)<br/>
<br/>
As an aside to Graham and others in England- yes I did arrange to have<br/>
a letterbox placed over there (double stamp at that) though I have not<br/>
yet published the clues. Since I probably won't be able to get my site<br/>
back up for a little while, I am wondering where I might post the clues<br/>
to my box in England. I could either send the clues to this list if<br/>
folks think it is appropriate, or I could just mail them to whomever<br/>
may want them. <br/>
<br/>
I am also planning to place a few more boxes in Florida over the next<br/>
month or so, but I sure would like to find someone elses boxes down<br/>
here. I will certainly be willing to post the new boxes on the<br/>
Letterboxing NA site but will need to know who is currently taking care<br/>
of doing that.<br/>

Hi Doc  !<br/>
<br/>
It's been a long time since your cheery email insignia has hit LbNA.<br/>

Welcome and hi from the English watcher here in London...<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Oh surely not <grin>....It was very ver very near as far as my exploits<br/>
were concerned !!<br/>
<br/>
It wasnt just "my mind" that was blown...What a windy state Florida is !!!<br/>
<br/>
Sad to say in those circumstances that we couldn't go looking..those nice<br/>
highway patrol people sent us away..and we missed em..but I will rerturn <br/>
<big grin=""><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I<br/>
I<br/>
&gt;went to the letterboxing.org site today in the hopes that perhaps there<br/>

Yep I will be pleased to search them out next year too ....<br/>

Hey Doc ..do send em to me and I'll get em published in the UK handbook<br/>
and send you a copy...and <br/>
<teehee> might get a chance to be one of the first finders........<g><br/>

Good to hear from you also! <br/>

Do you know if any of the awaiting clues for Fl letterboxes? If so, could <br/>
someone send them directly to me. Wow 100 letterboxes by one person, that <br/>
is impressive!<br/>

I'm fairly certain that none of the 'unposted' boxes is in Florida.<br/>

Good to hear from you.<br/>
As you can see, the LBNA site has grown nicely - I'm not sure if there<br/>
is any accurate count these days. But it is growing.<br/>
<br/>
I guess you'll just have to recruit a few boxers to get any Fla.<br/>
challanges.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, best wishes for the stanon!<br/>
