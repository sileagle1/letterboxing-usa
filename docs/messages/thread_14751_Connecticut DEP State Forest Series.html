<br/>
At long last, all 30 Connecticut State Forest Letterboxes are placed and the <br/>
clues posted.  These boxes have been posted to celebrate the centennial of <br/>
Connecticut's first state forest, Meshomasic, in Portland (and 2nd in the <br/>
country).<br/>
<br/>
You can recognize these boxes by their posting on the letterboxing.org site <br/>
as DEP State Forest boxes - for example, DEP Meshomasic State Forest (although <br/>
there is something wrong with one of the American Legion State Forest <br/>
postings).  Or, you can go directly to the DEP letterboxing page at:<br/>
<a href="http://www.dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/letterbox.htm">http://www.dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/letterbox.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
As an incentive to search for these boxes, if you visit five of these boxes <br/>
and let DEP know (at DEP.Forestry@po.state.ct.us), you are eligible for a <br/>
patch.<br/>
<br/>
As a newly announced incentive, if you visit all 30 boxes and let us know, we <br/>
will send you an official CT DEP Forestry walking stick!  Who'll be the <br/>
first.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, enjoy the search.  If the letterbox community is interested, DEP <br/>
Forestry along with the CT Forest and Park Association is planning a big <br/>
Forestry Field Day on October 4th at People's State Forest in Barkhamstead.  Perhaps <br/>
the letterboxers would like to participate - have a booth or table to explain <br/>
letterboxing or just a gathering to trade stamps.  If anyone would like to be <br/>
part of this and wants to take a role in organizing it, you can let me know <br/>
at chris.donnelly@po.state.ct.us<br/>
<br/>
Take care / good luck.  Enjoy the Forest!<br/>
<br/>
Chris <br/>
