CLUES: <br/>
Sweetwater Campground is one of many parks operated by the Corps of<br/>
Engineers (COE) on Georgia Lakes. The campgrounds usually offer<br/>
camping<br/>
facilities, day use areas, and boat launching ramps. Thus far the<br/>
Corps<br/>
has not restricted letterboxing and geocaching as have the Georgia<br/>
State<br/>
parks.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the COE campgrounds on Allatoona Lake close after Labor Day<br/>
and don't open again until mid April. The closed campgrounds provide<br/>
wonderful<br/>
places to walk ole Charliedog.<br/>
<br/>
Sweetwater Campground is located off GA Hwy 20 west, about six miles<br/>
from Canton. Take I-575 to Canton then GA 20 West. You will cross<br/>
Knox Bridge<br/>
then go curving up a hill. The turn to the Campground is at the top<br/>
of the hill, to the left at the store. <br/>
<br/>
To get the only information you will need for the first letterbox,<br/>
go to the website for the American Canoeing Association's national<br/>
sailing<br/>
committee (http://www.enter.net/~skimmer/}. If you explore the<br/>
website, you may discover information that will<br/>
tweak your interest in canoe sailing. Specifically look for<br/>
information<br/>
about the ACA Class canoe lateen sail that is sold by the ACA, the<br/>
sail that is on our canoe. How large is it in square feet?<br/>
<br/>
 THE SWEETWATER CAMPGROUND LETTERBOX:<br/>
Add 6 to the number of square feet in the ACA sail. Go to the<br/>
campsitepost with that number. <br/>
