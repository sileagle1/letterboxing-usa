with the history of Whisper. These sorts of things contribute a lot <br/>
to the page and the box!<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a good idea to include the waiver. You can link to a <br/>
copy at one of our sites, or just save the page and put it on your <br/>
own site.<br/>

&gt; Hello everyone,<br/>
&gt;  Well it has been a quiet weekend, so I created another letterbox. Today my<br/>
&gt; 5 yr.. old daughter Maegan and I planted it. Here are the clues,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Lake/6552/box2.html .<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a question for everyone,<br/>
&gt;  I was wondering if I should put up a waiver of liability on my site, like<br/>
&gt; I've seen on other pages. What is your opinion on this? Should I be<br/>
&gt; concerned about getting sued if someone gets hurt looking for one of my<br/>
&gt; boxes?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks &amp; Happy hunting :-)<br/>

Your two boxes are pretty close together - they may have to share a <br/>
single dot on the state maps.<br/>
<br/>
What, in this case, do you think would be the most appropriate label: <br/>
Sunken Meadow? Smithtown? Kings Park??<br/>

Three cheers for Ed and Maegan!!!  Keep up the good work!!!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I have a question for everyone,<br/>
&gt;   I was wondering if I should put up a waiver of liability on my site, like<br/>
&gt;  I've seen on other pages.<br/>
<br/>
Ed,<br/>
It's up to you.  As long as your page is being mainly accessed from the LbNA <br/>
website, I wouldn't worry much about it.  A reference to the waiver appears <br/>
on the main page (with the USA map), so if any litigatious soul should have <br/>
problems, we can always point out that they had adequate warning.<br/>
<br/>
If you do want to reference a waiver, just add a link to<br/>
http://members.aol.com/catsdice/lbna/clues/waiver.htm<br/>
<br/>
I don't recommend creating multiple copies of the waiver.  As long as we all <br/>
link to the same page, we can decide as a group what needs to be stated <br/>
there, and we only have to update one page to make any neccessary changes.  <br/>
If anyone feels the waiver at this page is inadequate, please bring your <br/>
concerns to this talk list.  Then we can discuss its shortcomings and make <br/>
edits that will benefit the entire group.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking,<br/>
Mitch Klink, LbNA co-webmaster<br/>
