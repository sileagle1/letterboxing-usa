Now that my clues have been published in an international magazine and<br/>
are jetting around world, I've decided to cash in on this good fortune.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm ... banner ads, pay to play, clothing, widgits, gidgits ...<br/>
<br/>
As I stand here starving between the proverbial cash cow and golden <br/>
goose, it occurs to me that there is a way to cash in, and keep my <br/>
clue site clutter free ... endorsements!  I mean, if Michael Jordan<br/>
can make more money selling shoes than using them, why can't I?<br/>
<br/>
My accountants tell me someone has already trademarked the mapsurfer<br/>
letterboxing boot (and it is quite nice, they tell me, because it is <br/>
designed to walk along those stone walls, and each one has a personalized<br/>
tread in case you forget your stamp), I will have to settle for <br/>
the more mundane sort of endorsements ...<br/>

<br/>
I hope no one minds a "commercial" clue ...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

and e-mail may be unavailable for the next couple of weeks (due to factors<br/>
beyond my control))<br/>
