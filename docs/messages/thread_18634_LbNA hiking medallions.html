I am sure itis just  a delay of some sort.  I ordered in the first wave and<br/>
remember it took a bit for them to be sent out.   Was James orderign another<br/>
bulk order?  The problem is most likely a delay in prodcution, or  life may<br/>
have happened to him.  I am sure  your medallions will arrive soon.  They<br/>
are very nice and worth the wait.<br/>
