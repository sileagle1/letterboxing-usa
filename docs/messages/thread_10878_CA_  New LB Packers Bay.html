Packers Bay Overlook Trail<br/>
Shasta Lake (approx 10 miles North of Redding)<br/>
Shasta County<br/>
California<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Take I-5 to the Packers Bay Road exit (follow the signs <br/>
carefully).  Head West on Packers Bay Road for approx 1 mile to first <br/>
trailhead parking area on the right.  Begin at the Overlook trailhead.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  Bring green, brown, light blue &amp; dark blue markers for added <br/>
effect.  Approx 0.4 mile roundtrip hike to a beautiful overlook <br/>
offering great views of Lake Shasta and surrounding mountains.  Great <br/>
break from a long drive on I-5.  Nice for children but is quite an <br/>
uphill climb to the top for little ones.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  From atop the overlook's knoll, locate the bench (or remnants <br/>
thereof--2 stone bases with a very wobbly wooden seat) that offers a <br/>
nice view through the trees (to the N &amp; W down the hill--forgot our <br/>
compass on this hike so this may be a guess).  The bench sits in <br/>
front of a 'V-shaped' pair of trees.  Look through the 'V' to a <br/>
boulder--your prize is 'packed' within its crevice.  Enjoy the view!<br/>
