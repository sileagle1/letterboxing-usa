Where is it – Baker’s Meadow.<br/>
Reservation Rd., off Rte 133 Andover, MA.  Essex County.<br/>
For trail map, and more information on Baker’s Meadow, visit <a href="http://projects.geosyntec.com/shawsheen/Portal/northern/hot/BakersMeadow.htm"><br/>
http://projects.geosyntec.com/shawsheen/Portal/northern/hot/BakersMeadow.htm</a>, <br/>
or <a href="http://www.avisandover.org/">http://www.avisandover.org</a>, for all AVIS reservations.<br/>
<br/>
Park – Along Cutler Rd., where Reservation Rd. takes a hard left, next to <br/>
entrance of West Parish Garden Cemetary.<br/>
<br/>
Entrance to the trail - From the entrance to West Parish Garden Cemetary, <br/>
walk down the hill, east on Reservation Rd., for less than 100 yards.  Take <br/>
the trail on the right, just beyond the AVIS sign (there is another AVIS <br/>
Reservation on the left).  Stay on the marked trail.<br/>
<br/>
Terrain – Easy, but undulating.<br/>
<br/>
Distance – Less than 1 mile.  Leisurely 1-hour round-trip.<br/>
<br/>
Confirmed Species – This is a great wildlife viewing area.  In only a few <br/>
visits, we’ve seen geese, several species of ducks, muskrat, and close-ups of <br/>
Great Blue heron and osprey. The largemouth bass fishing is good too, though <br/>
angling access is muddy and challenging.  We haven’t seen the beavers yet, <br/>
but signs are there.<br/>
<br/>
Clues – Moderate.<br/>
<br/>
Return trip - Once your search is complete, you can go back the way you came, <br/>
or continue along the trail, as it will come out further down Reservation Rd. <br/>
 Take a left to return to your car.  This is a narrow road. Please watch for <br/>
traffic when walking.<br/>
<br/>

Busy Beavers<br/>

Follow the trail<br/>
down to the pond<br/>
Over a bridge<br/>
then one more beyond<br/>
<br/>
Along the path<br/>
you should go<br/>
Look sharp for trees<br/>
felled to and fro<br/>
