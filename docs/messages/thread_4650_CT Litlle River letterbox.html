<div>Jurneez,</div>
<div>    
Dan, Max, and I went to Rock Springs today to check 
on the status on the Little River Box.  I am pleased to tell you that it is 
still there.  Although I have to admit, even though I hid it, I couldn't 
find it right away!  It looks like the rocks may have shifted some, and 
leaves had blown over, making the mica covered rocks really hard to see.  
Even when I thought I had found the spot, I had to pull two rocks out and look 
in pretty deep to get it.  To make it easier to spot, we put a large rock 
flecked with mica on top of the wall where it is hidden.  Then we put one 
of the smaller mica rocks that was covering it standing up against the wall, so 
that it was a bit more obvious to spot.  If you move that rock, then lift 
up the rock behind it, you should find the little river tucked snuggly 
inside.</div>
<div>    If you don't live 
nearby, you may want to wait a week or two to go back.  We scouted out 
another location nearby and found a perfect spot for a new box.  Now to 
carve a stamp and to get out and hide it!  We will keep you posted.  I 
hope you have a chance to get back and find the Little 
River!</div>

For getting back to us so quickly. I knew I had done a lot of hiking <br/>
that day when we looked for the Little River box but I still had some <br/>
get up &amp; go in me and was somewhat let down when I couldn't find it. I <br/>
also moved leaves, walked both sides of the wall, did small paces &amp; <br/>
large paces, even went in the other direction. Nature has it own way <br/>
of changing the sites &amp; they don't remain the same. I will most <br/>
certainly go again. Maybe I'll wait for the new box though. That's a <br/>
great place to hike and I think I'll get there for a sunrise from the <br/>
"Lookout Bench".<br/>
thanks again,<br/>
jurneez &amp; vinnie the Dog. <br/>
