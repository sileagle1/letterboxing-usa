Planted on behalf of Jolly G-Man and Ladybug's National Mystery Letterbox<br/>
Project<br/>
<br/>
The Clue<br/>
<br/>
Park at the pier in the south part of Hyde Mainland in northwest Georgia.<br/>
Walk under the bridge to the southwest and continue southwest along the<br/>
beach. After 600 meters or so, you'll see 61 year old JLH memorialized "with<br/>
all our hate". Naughty Simon's Darkhouse should be prominent to the south.<br/>
After another 40 meters, take the trail to the left and immediately take the<br/>
utility trail for a second left. At pole #0.25, there is a triple tree. From<br/>
there, sight another tree 20 meters away at 10 degrees. At the base of that<br/>
tree, you should find the Well Hydden Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The Disclaimers<br/>
<br/>
The usual and customary LBNA disclaimers apply. Please note that some of the<br/>
vegetation that hides letterboxes and geocaches on Hyde Mainland can be<br/>
sharp, so be careful reaching. The logs for geocaches on Hyde Mainland,<br/>
especially the cache that's more or less in the same patch of woods, tell of<br/>
a strong insect problem, especially during the summer. Use your favorite<br/>
precautions against biting insects. While publicly posted spoilers are<br/>
discouraged, private notes related to the condition of the letterbox will be<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
