<div>In the summer cottage town of Harwich we turned 
onto Uncle Venies Lane toward Red River Beach.  We drove on past Sunrise 
and the place where Herring run to a well maintained public beach.  At the 
beach we turned right in search of a parking spot near the end.  Three cars 
of high school friends stepped out into the spring air laced  with salt. 
Our reunion weekend was almost at an end.  25 years had passed since we 
heard the band play  Pomp and Circumstance, we were the same, but now all 
looked like our mothers had in those wistful days. Where does time go.  We 
laughed and posed for one last photo op. We stood smiling our back to a lone 
cedar tree near two poles. Sandy dunes a backdrop to our portrait of time.  
We were going our seperate ways any moment....... but first, a memory ,a 
letterbox that will mark the place where we found our friends again and walked 
the beach recalling high school days and sharing the time in between.  So 
look for where we took that photo. The beach sign to the right, pass between the 
two poles to the cedar tree, beneath the aromatic boughs is your treasure.  
Please make a opportunity to take a picture as you  uncover your treasure 
to camoflage your activity.  Then take some advice....call an old 
friend.  </div></body></html>
