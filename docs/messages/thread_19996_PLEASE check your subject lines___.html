                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just like in normal conversation, sometimes one topic (or message <br/>
posting, in this case) leads to another. <br/>
<br/>
As someone with a limited amount of time to be online, I would like <br/>
to THANK those who DO change the subject line when they reply and to <br/>
encourage those who may not have been doing so, to PLEASE consider <br/>
doing everyone a favor and making sure the subject line does indeed <br/>
pertain to the message.<br/>
<br/>
The most recent example has to do with the subject line "adopting <br/>
boxes" ... a thread I would be interested in following. However, <br/>
there were many replies to messages with that subject line that had <br/>
NOTHING to do with adopting boxes and much to do with boxing with <br/>
children ... a topic I would not choose to persure at this time.<br/>
<br/>
The problem comes when having to decide, to follow a thread that has <br/>
deviated from the subject line or risk missing ligitimate replies <br/>
further down the line that ARE still on topic.<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone reads the list on a daily basis, and with the volume of <br/>
messages this list generates, choices have to be made. The Digest <br/>
filter I use, is only as good as the subject lines message <br/>
responders use.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for taking time to making things easier for some of us.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
