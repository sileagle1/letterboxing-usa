<br/>
A smile so big, with giggles that grow.<br/>
A sad little pout and big tears that so easily flow.<br/>
Some hugs and some kisses always bring her around<br/>
The gift of her laughter the most wonderful sound.  <br/>
<br/>
That's our little Emily, she is so cute.<br/>
Stamp her box and send her a message.<br/>
She'll be happy to see them.<br/>
And that's why we all love her.<br/>
<br/>
An easy mile, or just a little better, around picturesque Belleville <br/>
Pond in Ryan Park, North Kingstown, R.I.<br/>
<br/>
To find this box, first find the Kurdziel's "Magic Tree House Series" <br/>
on the What's New page and grab a copy of "Afternoon on the Amazon". <br/>
Follow the directions to  Ryan Park, and the boat launch area, and <br/>
from there, proceed to find "Afternoon on the Amazon". After stamping <br/>
in at that box, continue on to find the steps, and take a few minutes <br/>
to explore the old camping area. After exploring the camp, continue <br/>
heading southeasterly, turn left with the trail, and at the "Y" <br/>
intersection, continue right for about 25 paces, to a rock on the <br/>
right, and just slightly off the path. From that rock, take a bearing <br/>
of 120. You'll find the "Gift to Emily" box tucked away in that group <br/>
of rocks. You'll have to bushwhack through some briars, but after <br/>
meeting Emily, I think you'll agree, it was worth it. And she'll be <br/>
glad you came. After stamping in, continue on the trail. and when the <br/>
pond comes into view, keep it on your right all the way back to your <br/>
car. After crossing two wooden bridges you'll walk a dirt road back <br/>
to the boat launch ramp. Hope you enjoy our Park.<br/>
<br/>
