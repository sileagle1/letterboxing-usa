<br/>
I own 3 black Labs.  The black lab named Sky at the Kids Day <br/>
Gathering is one of mine.  I love taking my dogs with me <br/>
letterboxing.  I am careful to only take them to places that allow <br/>
dogs.  I have a paw print stamp and stamp in whatever dogs I happen <br/>
to have with me that day.  I also have florescent orange vests for my <br/>
dogs during hunting season. On Sunday I went out letterboxing with a <br/>
friend who brought 3 of her black labs. All total we had 5 black labs <br/>
hiking with us that day.  It took me a while to stamp in all those <br/>
dogs!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We box with our beagle, Cajun Buddy, who has a<br/>
Snoopy-ish stamp of his own.  Unfortunately, he's<br/>
getting older and is epileptic so we are limited to 3<br/>
miles and under while hiking with him.  (thank you<br/>
everyone who indicates on the clues how long the hike<br/>
is!)<br/>
<br/>
Last summer, while doing Randy's Blue Mountain<br/>
Mystery, we underestimated how much hiking we would do<br/>
once we were in the actual area and my husband ended<br/>
up carrying him the last 1/2 mile out.  Poor old dog<br/>
slept the whole rest of the day. Poor old husband did,<br/>
too. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
While stamping in at Laurette's Blistering Blue<br/>
Barnacles, Tig and I met a lady whose sheltie had his<br/>
feet all wrapped up due to some injury.  She didn't<br/>
want to leave him behind while walking her other dog<br/>
so she pushed him along in a baby carriage!<br/>
<br/>
Buddy loves hiking with us, but we are saddened that<br/>
we can't always take him along on the longer outings.<br/>
<br/>
PS- he's a true believer in a little bit of that<br/>
powerbar Daddy slips him. ;o)<br/>
