                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just subscribed to this magazine and was thrilled to find our <br/>
quirky hobby mentioned on page 20.  Granted, we didn't get a lot of <br/>
room, and we are right next to the geocachers, but still, pretty <br/>
groovy.  <br/>
<br/>
We are referred to as "Luddites" which I take as a compliment.  <br/>
Those of you who have yet to carve a stamp may take offense at "the <br/>
catch" but be honest, we all appreciate the effort of a hand-made <br/>
stamp.  I find that the less talent you have in an area, the more <br/>
you appreciate those with the gift.  Since I can't carve a straight <br/>
line, I am a huge admirer of those who can.  <br/>
<br/>
Sarah and I spent an enjoyable Sunday locating the Black Rock Mill <br/>
box left by the Forest Frog Family.  The creek was lovely and the <br/>
white-tails abundant.  We also searched for the Seneca Creek Mill <br/>
box but came away empty handed.  We never could figure out where <br/>
exactly the top of the hill was and the ring was conspicuously <br/>
absent.  <br/>
<br/>
Thwarted, we decided to hide a micro-box in the park and will post <br/>
clues as soon as Sarah can dig out from behind a pile of tiny <br/>
costumes. (she is costuming a production of Fiddler on the Roof)<br/>
<br/>
Although busy, she also boxed in the morning with her husband and <br/>
all told, the ADG released 2 hitchhikers.  One, the Haircut Rabbit <br/>
Jr, belonged to Psychomommy and hid in the bottom of my pack for <br/>
quite a while.  I thought unleashing him on Easter was quite <br/>
appropriate.  The name of the other hitcher has escaped me for the <br/>
moment but we will post them to our site if you are curious.<br/>
<br/>
Clues for the micro-box, "The Ultimate Walker," will be coming soon <br/>
to a trail near you.<br/>
<br/>
GO RYAN!<br/>
