Besides bringing out well thought out opinions, the 'naughty' posts brought out opinions from those who'd never posted before.  Perhaps dissent ("thoughtless" as it may be interpreted) is good for shaking the group up...causing us to look at ourselves.

And though I don't agree with how his/her opinion was offered up, I can't help but say that after (48 hours+) I too still am uncomfortable with someone posting to the group as if they are a child.  But, as they say...that's my s**t.  And if mama LizardButt wants to continue to do so, that's hers.  And I thank her for getting this exploration started.<br/>

LizardbuttsFAMILY just like So and So Clan.  This is a family <br/>
enjoying letterboxing, hiking, camping, going to the beach,etc. <br/>
  Yes, I too worry about perverts on the internet.  This is not the <br/>
case.  She has been open and upfront about everything.  When she gets <br/>
interested in something she does a lot of research.  If you all read <br/>
the FAQ page you too could have learned about geocaching which then <br/>
leads to other subjects ie: benchmarks. <br/>
  I hope this puts to rest all the wild and crazy thoughts out there.<br/>
  I'm not going to hide behind my handle.  I am real. Right now a <br/>
very recent cancer patient and hope to be survivor. Letterboxing has <br/>
given me something to look forward to. The planning, planting, <br/>
hunting, hiking and meeting new people has been fun. Believe me <br/>
people Look for what is positive not the negative. I came into this <br/>
for the fun. It's not nice to sully this engaging activity.<br/>
