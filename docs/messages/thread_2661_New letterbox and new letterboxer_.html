<div>Letterbox BUTTE VIEW</div>
<div>    John Dawson, 370 Dogwood 
Lane, Prescott, AZ 86301</div>
<div>Arizona, Yavapai County, City of Prescott, 
Prescott Nat. F.</div>
<div>June 2001:</div>
<div>Reference map: Iron Springs 7.5 min topo.</div>
<div>Hilltop location UTM E 0360314 N 3825278, no 
name.</div>
<div>Angles referred to true north, deviation 12.5 
degrees.</div>
<div>Round trip about 2.5 miles, mostly on trails.</div>
<div>    Drive west on Gurley Street in Prescott, 
out of town, to the parking for the Thumb Butte Recreation Area.  Park here 
and hike north from the north end of the parking loop on trail number 318, then 
turn left on trail 317.</div>
<div>    Find the hilltop from here; no trail, and 
the brush is heavy in places.  Don't wear shorts; gloves are 
advisable.</div>
<div>    At the hilltop, find the obscure trail on 
the south side of the top where it it comes up a rocky hill then levels out and 
becomes smoother.  The exact spot is where the trail slope changes and the 
trail goes between two small trees, an oak on the left and a pine on the 
right.</div>
<div>    From this position go 17 paces north, on 
the trail, to where it jogs to the right around a small tree.  From the 
easternmost limit of this jog go 18 paces at 115 degrees then stop.  This 
is not a trail but is open.  From this point go 13 paces at 35 degrees and 
you should be in the middle of a patch of lichen covered rocks, about ten by ten 
feet.  On the western edge of this patch, partly under a pine tree, is a 
small one-rock monument setting on a bigger rock; very obscure.</div>
<div>    From this monument go 14 paces at 46 
degrees, in the clear, then an added 9 paces at 152 degrees to get to a fairly 
large juniper tree with four trunks.</div>
<div>    Go around this juniper to the east side 
then go 16 paces at 80 degrees to a natural group of rocks.  Stand above 
this and look down to see a notch pointed to the north and formed by two of the 
bigger rocks.  The letter box is under a rock in this notch.</div>
<div>    The UTM coordinates given are not for this 
point and a GPS is not needed except to increase confidence of being in the 
right area and on the right hill.  The map is 
essential.</div></body></html>
