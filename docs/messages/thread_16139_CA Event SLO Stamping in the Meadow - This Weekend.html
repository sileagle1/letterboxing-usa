<br/>
As the event approaches we are doing a last nose count. Here is whom <br/>
we think might be there. Please feel free to let me know if you are <br/>
not on the list and are probably going to be there.<br/>
<br/>
Buzzard &amp; French Hen<br/>
Turtle Leader, Snail Lady &amp; Lock Dude<br/>
Princess Lea &amp; Aunt Judy<br/>
Maddog BMW (w/another adult and 2 kids)<br/>
Jiggs Clan (Pete, Erin, Erica and Sarah)<br/>
GSD (3)<br/>
Double Saj &amp; Old Blue<br/>
The Furies (2 of the 3)<br/>
Donut, Watermelon, Jelly Bean, Moody Cat, G String<br/>
Jane &amp; Simon (from San Diego - not sure how many else)<br/>
The Millions (Kylie &amp; Chase &amp; Lance)<br/>
Sadie from Nebraska and Dave<br/>
Doubtful Katherine (&amp; date)<br/>
Emily the Rose<br/>
McKenna Sampley &amp; father (possibly additional friends)<br/>
Pat and Don Metlzer<br/>
JugglerMouse &amp; Sir B<br/>
(and possibly two or more surprise guests)<br/>
<br/>
We want to thank Buzzard &amp; Stamp Luis Obispo for sponsoring us. <br/>
<br/>
We have about 19 boxes ready to hide at the site. Four specially <br/>
carved presidential stamps will be there from Just Beth (great work, <br/>
you will want to collect these!) Hitchhikers. A special event stamp <br/>
carved by Emily Rose. Other traveling stamps. Stamp Luis Obispo has a <br/>
stamp at their store, which will only be available on Saturday, <br/>
Sunday and Monday of this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
We have at least 80 hot dogs (chicken based), catsup, mustard, <br/>
relish, buns, paper plates ready for you. There are drink machines in <br/>
the park. We will have two grills going just in case anyone brings <br/>
cheese. Food and exchanges before anything else (11-12:30)  If you <br/>
wish to bring some food to share, please do.<br/>
<br/>
We would like to do a group photo about 12:30. We will have the <br/>
drawing for prizes right after that. Then will pass out the clues to <br/>
the boxes hidden in the park. The order of the boxes on the sheets <br/>
will be randomized to ensure more even hunting. <br/>
<br/>
JugglerMouse is releasing her latest Redwall stamp, Rollo the Bank <br/>
Vole. I am releasing three new in the Middle Earth series: Gollum's <br/>
Pool, Shadowfax, and Mirkwood. We have a new series starting: <br/>
Loteria. <br/>
<br/>
Beer and liquor are not allowed at the park. Sorry. We could not <br/>
afford the insurance the park demanded. <br/>
<br/>
Dogs are welcome on leash. Strollers, wheelchairs, and folks with <br/>
electric vehicles can easily navigate the park. Most boxes will be <br/>
close by the paths. Suggest you bring sunscreen and layered clothing. <br/>
If the fog comes in, it will be coolish. <br/>
<br/>
Bring your compasses. JugglerMouse and I love to give compass <br/>
headings. All paces are single paces.<br/>

<br/>
I am sure I have forgotten something. If you are not on the list and <br/>
want to come, please do.<br/>
<br/>
Write me for my cell phone number if you wish that link.<br/>
<br/>
Tired and still carving,<br/>

I want to know how you hid 19 boxes at this park.  I looked at it <br/>
briefly thinking to plant ONE box here but ultimately gave up and <br/>
headed to the Water Conservation Gargen!  (Which, in hindsight, <br/>
wasn't a good place to hide it with all the bulldozers and stuff <br/>
running over it.)<br/>

Dear Ryan, Amanda, etal,<br/>
<br/>
Now that would be telling... Let us say that the boxes will not <br/>
remain at the park after the event. And if you should have been at <br/>
the event you might have found the trek way too easy, the clues <br/>
almost too direct. However, nearby are some good climbs and coded <br/>
clues. If you ever get back, try the Middle Earth series. And the <br/>
Redwall series of JugglerMouse, though easy, is very beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
And do remember that rocks are where you find them, Velcro like duct <br/>
tape holds up the world, and when in doubt create a fake rock or <br/>
water pipe. I think I learn most of that from you, legerdemaine, and <br/>
James Bond films (or was that "Get Smart"?)<br/>
<br/>
Your "Run for the Border," now deceased, had RL mushrooms growing <br/>
over the top of it when I found the box. Now that is creative! No <br/>
more Water Conservation Gardening in San Luis, I fear. However, the <br/>
community garden has a very nice badger box in it. <br/>
<br/>
Carrying on in your absence,<br/>
