Notice I did not say stamp-carvers. I had a box of student-sized <br/>
squares of "MasterCarve" material, plus a lot of scraps to practice <br/>
on, and 12 carving tools.  I also had on hand some adhesive-backed <br/>
foam sheets that could be cut with scissors and stuck onto a wood <br/>
block. They are made by All American Graphics and are also available <br/>
from the Dick Blick online art supply catalog where I buy <br/>
the "MasterCarve" material. I opened the stamp-making class to anyone <br/>
who felt safe with scissors and sharp tools, noting that there are <br/>
some adults who don't meet that requirement. The librarian had <br/>
purchased small spiral notebooks and "Ink Dot" stamp pads and pencils <br/>
for each participant.  She also had a supply of scrap paper and <br/>
printouts of possible design ideas.<br/>
<br/>
There were 3 unaccompanied 10 to 12-year-olds who carved their own <br/>
designs, 2 younger participants who carved under the supervision of <br/>
parents, and a 4-year-old who drew a lovely design that was then <br/>
carved by her mother.  The scraps of "MasterCarve" material are very <br/>
useful, for experimenting with the feel of how much pressure to use, <br/>
and for trying out how thick to make a cut. No scrap is too small. A <br/>
7-year-old learned to carve small circular dots on a tiny scrap; her <br/>
finished design included bubbles coming out of the mouths of her <br/>
fish. <br/>
<br/>
The first time I taught a letterboxing class, I handed out the scrap <br/>
paper and pencils and got designs too big to fit on the carving area <br/>
or to stick onto the wooden blocks.  Now I have the stamp-makers <br/>
trace their block onto their scrap paper and make designs that fit <br/>
within that space.  I was impressed with two stamp-carvers who turned <br/>
their squares to make diamond-shaped designs.  I encourage beginners <br/>
to make mostly dark designs with white lines, rather than try to <br/>
carve raised lines to make a dark line on a white background.<br/>
<br/>
As for the letterboxes, I had 8 temporary boxes hidden around the <br/>
library (inside and out on the grounds), with a single direction page <br/>
written for each box. Borrowing one page at a time required the <br/>
hunters to come back to the classroom between each find, and also <br/>
eliminated multiple hunters ganging up on one box.<br/>
<br/>
Each temporary box illustrated a different kind of hide: a pair of <br/>
Altoid tins wrapped together and using rare-earth magnets to stick to <br/>
a hiding place, a birdhouse in the library courtyard, a "skirt-<br/>
lifter" (a small box hidden under a streetlamp skirting box: when <br/>
telling students about this kind of hide you should mention that <br/>
wasps sometimes go into that kind of place), an army decon kit hidden <br/>
up high with a string "pullied" over a branch, a box at the front <br/>
desk that you must ask the librarian for, an "M 'n' M" tube wrapped <br/>
with camo tape and hidden in an evergreen, an easter egg hidden in a <br/>
potted plant, and a small box hidden in a decorative basket in an <br/>
alcove in the classroom.  If I had had time, I would have bought one <br/>
of those fake books that is really a box which can hold small items, <br/>
hidden on a bookshelf.  <br/>
<br/>
The class began with me "creating" a letterbox and hiding it in the <br/>
classroom.  I showed how to create a set of directions, writing out <br/>
the directions on a sheet of paper, then "posting" those directions <br/>
on the table that represented our website full of clues.  To my <br/>
surprise, all of the students included that demo letterbox and its <br/>
stamp in their finds for the day.<br/>
<br/>
By the time we finished exchanging stamps with each other, and <br/>
hunting all of the library boxes, each participant had collected 16 <br/>
stamp images. I had six stamp-makers and two adult helpers and the <br/>
librarian. I was very glad that the class did not fill to 10 stamp-<br/>
makers. Everyone seems to need help with something at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Allow at least an hour to hide the temporary boxes and write out the <br/>
directions. The class took the full three hours for the younger <br/>
participants, although the three older children finished in two <br/>
hours.  The introduction explaining what letterboxing is and <br/>
designing a stamp takes 45-60 minutes. The carving takes 30-60 <br/>
minutes, and the hunting of 9 boxes takes 30-60 minutes. Exchanging <br/>
stamps took 15-30 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I keep the kit of temporary letterboxes and carving tools and <br/>
materials in a large plastic tub, along with geocaching class <br/>
supplies. I get a call to teach 3-4 classes each year around the <br/>
area. There seems to be about an equal demand for letterboxing and <br/>
geocaching classes. By the way, the local geocachers have also asked <br/>
for a class in how to make letterboxing stamps.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great work! Will the kids hide their own? Will they be hidden around <br/>
the library? I have to get a series out that my 4H kids did. I have <br/>
a feeling I'll be tromping out alone to hide them as I find my <br/>
families get so busy. But if they go to find their own, that will be <br/>
okay with me too. <br/>
<br/>
I have to share a funny story.  I went letterboxing in a little town <br/>
in South Carolina.  One particular box was hidden in a very cool <br/>
little museum. It had been someone's home in the thirties, so the <br/>
design of the building was very funky (oh, to be rich). The <br/>
directions stated that the box was behind a 'door' which turned out <br/>
to be quite an elaborate Asian piece, but it wasn't there.  As I <br/>
turned away from it, disappointed with no find, I saw the box behind <br/>
quite an urn. "Oh my," I thought to myself. "If this is from the <br/>
Ming Dynasty and I tip it over, I will lay down and die." The box <br/>
was SO BIG. It was kind a lunch box thing. I carefully got it out <br/>
from behind the urn and tippy toed into the basement area to stamp <br/>
up so I could be discreet with my lunch box.  Upon opening the box, <br/>
I learned that it was hidden--with the permission of the museum--by <br/>
girl scouts. WHEW.  I really worried about the placement of the box, <br/>
but since the museum knows about it, it must be okay with them that <br/>
it is behind that urn! <br/>
<br/>
The wonderful thing about letterboxing is that it takes you to <br/>
places you wouldn't otherwise know about. To get to the museum, I <br/>
had to walk through an absolutely charming park. In the 'olden <br/>
days', before boxing, I wouldn't have even visited this particular <br/>
town, let alone find that park! <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; There were 3 unaccompanied 10 to 12-year-olds who carved their own <br/>
&gt; designs, 2 younger participants who carved under the supervision <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; parents, and a 4-year-old who drew a lovely design that was then <br/>
&gt; carved by her mother.  The scraps of "MasterCarve" material are <br/>
very <br/>
&gt; useful, for experimenting with the feel of how much pressure to <br/>
use, <br/>
&gt; and for trying out how thick to make a cut. No scrap is too small. <br/>
A <br/>
&gt; 7-year-old learned to carve small circular dots on a tiny scrap; <br/>
her <br/>
&gt; finished design included bubbles coming out of the mouths of her <br/>
&gt; fish. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The first time I taught a letterboxing class, I handed out the <br/>
scrap <br/>
&gt; paper and pencils and got designs too big to fit on the carving <br/>
area <br/>
&gt; or to stick onto the wooden blocks.  Now I have the stamp-makers <br/>
&gt; trace their block onto their scrap paper and make designs that fit <br/>
&gt; within that space.  I was impressed with two stamp-carvers who <br/>
turned <br/>
&gt; their squares to make diamond-shaped designs.  I encourage <br/>
beginners <br/>
&gt; to make mostly dark designs with white lines, rather than try to <br/>
&gt; carve raised lines to make a dark line on a white background.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for the letterboxes, I had 8 temporary boxes hidden around the <br/>
&gt; library (inside and out on the grounds), with a single direction <br/>
page <br/>
&gt; written for each box. Borrowing one page at a time required the <br/>
&gt; hunters to come back to the classroom between each find, and also <br/>
&gt; eliminated multiple hunters ganging up on one box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Each temporary box illustrated a different kind of hide: a pair of <br/>
&gt; Altoid tins wrapped together and using rare-earth magnets to stick <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; a hiding place, a birdhouse in the library courtyard, a "skirt-<br/>
&gt; lifter" (a small box hidden under a streetlamp skirting box: when <br/>
&gt; telling students about this kind of hide you should mention that <br/>
&gt; wasps sometimes go into that kind of place), an army decon kit <br/>
hidden <br/>
&gt; up high with a string "pullied" over a branch, a box at the front <br/>
&gt; desk that you must ask the librarian for, an "M 'n' M" tube <br/>
wrapped <br/>
&gt; with camo tape and hidden in an evergreen, an easter egg hidden in <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; potted plant, and a small box hidden in a decorative basket in an <br/>
&gt; alcove in the classroom.  If I had had time, I would have bought <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; of those fake books that is really a box which can hold small <br/>
items, <br/>
&gt; hidden on a bookshelf.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The class began with me "creating" a letterbox and hiding it in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; classroom.  I showed how to create a set of directions, writing <br/>
out <br/>
&gt; the directions on a sheet of paper, then "posting" those <br/>
directions <br/>
&gt; on the table that represented our website full of clues.  To my <br/>
&gt; surprise, all of the students included that demo letterbox and its <br/>
&gt; stamp in their finds for the day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By the time we finished exchanging stamps with each other, and <br/>
&gt; hunting all of the library boxes, each participant had collected <br/>
16 <br/>
&gt; stamp images. I had six stamp-makers and two adult helpers and the <br/>
&gt; librarian. I was very glad that the class did not fill to 10 stamp-<br/>
&gt; makers. Everyone seems to need help with something at the same <br/>
time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Allow at least an hour to hide the temporary boxes and write out <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; directions. The class took the full three hours for the younger <br/>
&gt; participants, although the three older children finished in two <br/>
&gt; hours.  The introduction explaining what letterboxing is and <br/>
&gt; designing a stamp takes 45-60 minutes. The carving takes 30-60 <br/>
&gt; minutes, and the hunting of 9 boxes takes 30-60 minutes. <br/>
Exchanging <br/>
&gt; stamps took 15-30 minutes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I keep the kit of temporary letterboxes and carving tools and <br/>
&gt; materials in a large plastic tub, along with geocaching class <br/>
&gt; supplies. I get a call to teach 3-4 classes each year around the <br/>
&gt; area. There seems to be about an equal demand for letterboxing and <br/>
&gt; geocaching classes. By the way, the local geocachers have also <br/>
asked <br/>
&gt; for a class in how to make letterboxing stamps.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the topic! I was glad to read what others are doing. <br/>
