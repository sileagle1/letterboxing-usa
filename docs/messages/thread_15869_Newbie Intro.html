                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone, I would like to introduce myself.  I am from Tennessee and I<br/>
recently rediscovered letterboxing after I had been into geocaching for a<br/>
while.  It happened after I ran accross what was called a Letterbox Hybrid,<br/>
I then did a search on letterboxing and found this group, the LbNA website,<br/>
and a lot of other sites as well.<br/>
<br/>
 I say rediscovered because I read that 98 Smithsonian Magazine article and<br/>
thought it sounded great but at that time I didn't have a computer and had<br/>
other comittments on my time so nothing came of my intrest, now I wish I had<br/>
presued it more.<br/>
<br/>
Be that as it may be, I am very new to this, I only have one stamp in my<br/>
logbook and I am still trying to get my personal stamp just the way I want<br/>
it.  I also see that Tennessee doesn't have a lot of  letterboxes and I hope<br/>
to change this in the furture, but that may take a while because my carving<br/>
skills aren't the best at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I also have done a couple of  virtuals which I found interesting and will<br/>
probably do more but I just haven't quite figured out how to put the<br/>
pictures/stamps into my logbook and make them look good.  I'm thinking<br/>
probably a glue stick of some sort will be the way to go on this.  Anyway I<br/>
know from reading the posts on the yahoo site that not everyone counts<br/>
virtuals in their F Count.  I have decide to count them, in part, I guess,<br/>
because there are so few boxes here, which brings me to another question.<br/>
<br/>
 Am I the only letterboxer from Tennessee on this group?<br/>
<br/>
The reason I ask is because I have noticed that several boxes are marked as<br/>
unclaimed and that some are placed by people from other states, which I have<br/>
no problem with, I'm just wondering how many letterboxers are in Tennessee.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Another option for getting virtual stamps into your log book is to <br/>
print them on an Avery label and then just peel and stick. You need <br/>
to find labels that are a good size for your log book.<br/>
