<br/>
Bolton:<br/>
  Powder House Hill and Rattlesnake Hill were found to be in fine <br/>

<br/>
  Whitcomb Garrison was in good condition, but was exposed. We <br/>
carefully replaced it so that it wouldn't be visible to the casual <br/>
passerby.<br/>
<br/>
   Kettle Hole has been wrecked. Some of the pieces including <br/>
unreadable  pages from the book were found. The stamp wasn't found, <br/>
but the area was covered in snow and ice at the time. We'll return <br/>
later and try to find the remaining pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Berlin:<br/>
   Whale of a Tale was found, but it was in a low spot and underwater. <br/>
The box had been well sealed, so the contents were undamaged. I placed <br/>
it on top of a rock to raise it above the water level. It remains <br/>
hidden though.<br/>
<br/>
   Triple Trouble is in good shape. Its container had been damaged, <br/>
but Walden Run had reconditioned it.<br/>

Could you please send out the clues for the letterboxes you mention,<br/>
if you have them electronically. I've looked on the letterbox.org<br/>
site, and the listing and clues aren't there. My nine-year old son and<br/>
I would be so grateful. Thanks for the update, too.<br/>

There are several Bolton letter boxes whose clues you won't find <br/>
on-line. The clues are available in the Bolton Public Library. As you <br/>
enter the library, look immediately to your left. You will find some <br/>
clues there in a set of shelves along with other local information. <br/>
The last time I looked there weren't many copies left. It would be a <br/>
good idea to make yourselves copies of the clues that you find there.<br/>
<br/>
Bolton's Bolton Quarry letter box clues are listed on-line as are <br/>
those for Harvard's Bowers Springs Letter Box which is very close to <br/>
Bolton.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
