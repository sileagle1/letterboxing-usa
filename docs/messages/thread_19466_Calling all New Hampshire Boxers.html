<br/>
I am flying to Manchester, NH this Friday thru Sunday to go letterboxi...er..to visit my best friend! Yeah, that's right! She has promised to take me boxing and I have promised she and her kids will have fun! I would love to meet up with any boxers for an exchange. She lives in Manchester and I think we plan to box in Nashua and maybe try some Mount Monadnock boxes, but perhaps that's a little ambitious for one weekend. Anyway, if you're in the Manchester/Nashua area and would like to meet up for an exchange please email me offlist and Cc: carpaydeeyum@aol.com so that she can help co-ordinate things as she is my hostess and knows the area. Thanks!<br/>
