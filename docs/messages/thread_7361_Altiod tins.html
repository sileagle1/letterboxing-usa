</p><p>I thought about those too. There won't be the problem with rust and they can still be painted. I would still put in a baggie if it needed weather proofing due to where it will be placed. If you try one, let us know.

<br/>
Kool Aid comes in a plastic container, which is water proof..<br/>
So does those new Lay's chip snack containers...<br/>
I just found some M&amp;M's (regular size) in a clear tube...<br/>
How about Mini M&amp;M's Container for a micro sized letterbox<br/>
Sucrets now come in a plastic container instead of tin.<br/>
<br/>
The list goes on and on.<br/>
