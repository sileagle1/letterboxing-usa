                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found a signature stamp in the St. George area of Utah. I know it is<br/>
a signature stamp because I found it logged into several boxes in the<br/>
area. the stamp was being used in summer 2007. It is a handcarved<br/>
image of a good looking dog and says Bella under the image. The person<br/>
signing in has the last name Bagley and lived in Chapel Hill North<br/>
Carolina. I posted this message on Atlas Quest a couple times and no<br/>
owner surfaced.<br/>
<br/>
The specific box where it was found was "Catch of the Day" at Ivens, Utah.<br/>
<br/>
If I don't find the owner I'm thinking I'll release it as a hitch hiker.<br/>
