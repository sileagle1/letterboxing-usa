I was up in the Keweenau Peninsula of Michigan's UP this past week camping<br/>
and looking for warblers with my sister (Grey Treefrog).  We found the<br/>
Superior View letterbox placed by Esperanza in good condition and took<br/>
some pictures of the very superior view.<br/>
<br/>
Later on in the week, as we were returning home, we stopped around Iron<br/>
Mountain to look for a few more boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Fumee Creek was supposed to be located in a lovely little roadside park,<br/>
and while we looked quite diligently (beware of poison ivy on the narrow<br/>
path to the box spot), we never found the box.  There had been quite a bit<br/>
of storm damage in the area, so the landmarks may have changed some.<br/>
Anyway, this was our first 'A' - attempted and not found box.  <br/>
<br/>
Fumee Lake Natural Area was great fun.  The dog loved the lake, which was<br/>
full of huge tadpoles and brilliant sunfish, along with a family of geese.<br/>
We found some Yellow Lady Slippers in the woods - I'm not sure I had seen<br/>
that variety before, so it was a special treat.  And a very friendly tree<br/>
frog let us get close and take photos of it sunning on a branch.  The box<br/>
contents were a little damp, since the outer bag had a hole in it and it<br/>
looked like all the pages before the ones we stamped in had been<br/>
harvested.  I sealed all the inner bits into a new baggie and hope that<br/>
will help keep the dampness out a little.<br/>
<br/>
Then, we went on to look for the Piers Gorge letterbox.  This was a<br/>
beautiful area, but pretty popular and we didn't find the box here either.<br/>
It looked as though someone may have traded a beer bottle for the box,<br/>
since there was one tucked into where we thought the box ought to be.  We<br/>
did continue out to Pier 4, but Pier 3 was our favorite!  It's unlikely we<br/>
would have discovered this place without the box clues, so we're glad we<br/>
tried for it!<br/>
<br/>
Nice walks, lovely weekend!  Thanks to all who planted boxes and made up<br/>
clues, whether we found the boxes or not!!<br/>

I'm certain this box has been AWOL for a while.  In June 2001 I looked<br/>
for Fumee Creek with no luck (and some good poison ivy rash for the<br/>
effort), and a good number of people have reported the same since then.<br/>
<br/>
Fumee Lake and Piers Gorge were nice, although I can see how the<br/>
latter might have vanished.<br/>
