                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry to be another voice for no go.  The "Seattle" airport is quite <br/>
a way from Seattle and from Tacoma for that matter.  Ground <br/>
transportation via Metro transit would take quite some time to get to <br/>
Dash Point ( in Federal way near Tacoma) or to one of the many West <br/>
Seattle boxes. <br/>
<br/>
If it were San Diego, where you can get to Balboa Park in no time via <br/>
taxi, You could do it.  But Seattle Tacoma traffic is notorious and <br/>
in September, likely you will have rain anyway ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So enjoy your layover.  Sorry to bring bad news. <br/>
<br/>
 I agree the notion of the havoc that a box IN the airport could <br/>
cause....  But it WOULD be fun.  Would require a bartender or other <br/>
vendor inside the loop.<br/>
<br/>
perhaps a code name drink at a certain bar would yield a box.<br/>
<br/>
Hummmmmmm ????<br/>
<br/>
Imagine a whole string of "airport boxes"<br/>
