I don't know....  I kind of like the idea of leaving the old stamp in <br/>
there along with the new one so you can show off just how much your <br/>
carving have improved.  =)  But it's not the end of my world if you <br/>
decide to pull the old stamp completely.<br/>
<br/>
As for the getting people to visit your box more than once--adding a <br/>
new stamp will certainly help.  (Leaving the old one won't detract <br/>
from that aspect either.)  But an even better way of doing that--hide <br/>
a completelly new letterbox in the park later in the year.  =)<br/>
<br/>
I don't really try to "market" my letterboxes, though.  If people <br/>
want to find them, they will.  If they really like the area, they'll <br/>
likely come back over and over again--with or without the box.  And <br/>
if the place didn't impress them so much that they'd want to come <br/>
back again, I wouldn't want to try convincing people to come back for <br/>
a repeat visit.  Let them find another beautiful, wonderful park that <br/>
they can't get enough of.<br/>
<br/>
Just because one can't hide letterboxes in Yosemite doesn't mean <br/>
people are going to stop visiting the place!  =)<br/>
<br/>
But then....  I don't think there's anything wrong with trying to <br/>
market your box for several seasons.  It's just not something I would <br/>
personally do for the reasons I gave.<br/>

&gt; some, the ones I carved when I first started look pretty bad and <br/>
&gt; very crude. <br/>
<br/>
That exact thought had crossed my mind about a few boxes. Rather than<br/>
recarve (unless you wanted hand vs store or really didn't like the<br/>
stamp)- My thought was keep the stamp for a couple of reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1) posterity - interesting historically to look back on the box and<br/>
stamp not only for its age but perhaps it really relates to something<br/>
for a particular time and location.<br/>
<br/>
For example: a particular stamp that I carved was not mounted because<br/>
it was carved in-situ that very day that it was placed out of sheer<br/>
inspiration. I won't ever replace the stamp but it will be mounted.<br/>
<br/>
2) inspiration - I find that rather than recarve and place in the same<br/>
box, I do a sequel to that box in a different location with<br/>
inspiration taken from the stamp used in the original box. <br/>
**see Secret Garden I &amp; II**<br/>
<br/>
So, in that sense - keep the original and make a sequel that is just<br/>
as enjoyable and shows the progression of stamp carving.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts<br/>

The concenses on that count is that it's NOT a new box.  Same <br/>
location, same clue, same box.  Even if the clue changes slightly to <br/>
move the box to a better hiding place doesn't necessarily make it a <br/>
new find.  (Especially if you don't even change the name of the <br/>

as a new find.  If you created it from scratch, it's a new box.<br/>
