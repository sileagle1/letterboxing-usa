                    <div class="plaintext-content">Martha by Mail #2 arrived in our mailbox yesterday. She was quite tired from <br/>
her travels and spent the day resting in the shade outside by the pool. She <br/>
insisted on helping with dinner and we had a lovely time dining under the <br/>
lantern lights she had strung overhead. We had so many candles burning my neighbors <br/>
thought our house was on fire. <br/>
<br/>
Since today is Sunday, she suggested we throw an impromptu brunch for the <br/>
entire neighborhood. Imagine my surprise when everyone accepted our invitation. <br/>
She charmed everyone and was busy dispensing advice to anyone who would listen. <br/>
The neighbors plan to start a movement to help her cause. She was quite happy <br/>
to stay home and clean up (I think my cleaning was not up to her standards) <br/>
while we went letterboxing in San Francisco. She had dinner prepared when we <br/>
came home and I'm reluctant to send her on her way tomorrow but I want to share <br/>
our good fortune with the next person on the list. Please be forewarned, she <br/>
will have to cross the country and may not be in the best of moods when she <br/>
arrives.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Martha arrived at my house to find total disarray.  The lawn hadn't been <br/>
mowed in a week and the house was a total mess.  After scoffing at the disarray of <br/>
the house and yard, Martha started to cook a pot roast in the oven, then went <br/>
out to mow the lawn.  While out mowing, she made friends with two neighbors <br/>
over the fence who have quite extensive vegetable gardens.  She was able to <br/>
charm enough vegetables from the neighbors to make a large tossed salad with a <br/>
light parsley and oil dressing.  After mowing the lawn, she came back in and <br/>
finished up dinner, making some wonderful augrautin potatoes, with five different <br/>
cheeses!  After a wonderful dinner with True Soccer Fan, Sammy the <br/>
Letterboxing Cat, Lynny G, and I, Martha decided to shine the copper pots with a mixture <br/>
of pickle juice, salt and a mild dish detergent.  <br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow, after a mineral soak in the tub, she plans on cleaning the house <br/>
before hopping onto a plane to the west coast.  Since this is her second <br/>
bi-coastal run in as many days, I'm sure she will be very tired and cranky when she <br/>
gets back to California.<br/>
