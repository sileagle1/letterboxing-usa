Here's an example of something I recently wrote concerning a new series I am planting as we speak:<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------<br/>
Avast ye landlubbers!  Heave to and prepare to be boarded!  Rumor has it that the scourge of the Pacific seas, Captain Thomas Cavendish, rich with the plunder of the Spanish ship the Santa Ana, the Manila Galleon, with the fabled Black Pearl of Manila in hand, has been blown ashore somewhere in the Pacific Northwest.  We be searching for the fabled Black Pearl of Manila and hear tell that Captain Cavendish, the scurvy dog, may have hidden it here about's.... Let me warn you, we'll take no lip from the likes of you about this, dead men tell no tales. We aims to find the treasure and we don't care what we has to do to gets it.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if your interested in joinin' me in this treasure hunt there matey, I'll give you an equal 1/16 share iffin' I find it and an equal 1/8 share iffin' you find it. Rumor has it that Cavendish hid a map in these parts when a storm blew him off course and into the Sound.  Find that map and ye'll be started on the journey. Legend has it though that the map is missing pieces.....  Matter of fact matey, the entire map is missing right now.  There may be some clues at http://www.myndworx.com but no one is sure at this point.  All I know is that the one that finds the map and deciphers Cavendish's clues, gets the Black Pearl!!! <br/>

I was putting it thru just on email, but Big Slick will stride into<br/>
the central NY landscape soon. We were out Wed. 8/13 and were able to<br/>
walk right up to the box that was hidden in near darkness (amazing in<br/>
itself) along with planting another in the series in the same park. So<br/>
I need to tidy up and finish the clues and post it.  If you are ever<br/>
around Syracuse you can look him up....soon.  <br/>
<br/>
And thanks for your kind words ROC'nRON. :-)<br/>
