OK.  The log book is full.  I added a few more rocks to the pile to <br/>
keep the box from floating away when the water rises.<br/>
<br/>
I emailed the placer at the address given in the log book, but the <br/>
email bounced.<br/>
<br/>
If Moonshadow is still active and interested could he take over the <br/>
box?<br/>
If not, is there someone who has boxes on the airline trail who <br/>
could adopt this box without having to travel extra distance?<br/>
If not, is there someone in the Colchester / Hebron area who could <br/>
adopt it?<br/>
If not, I could be a foster parent.  But then again, you know how <br/>
the foster kids get treated.<br/>
