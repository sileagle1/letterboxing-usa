No, this ain't your ordinary can of Spam, this is a bona fide public service announcement!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Step up folks and let me tell you all about it!  I didn't come here today to make you laugh,  or to make you cry, I came here to sell you on something. Fly-By-Night Enterprises, a subsidiary of Vaportech Incorporated, has come out with an *amazing* new website, yours for a price so small I'm embarrassed to mention it here on these mailing lists.<br/>
<br/>
It's not a slicer. It's not a dicer. It's not a chopper, not a hopper, or even a red-tailed flopper! It won't cure world hunger, nor promote whirled peas, but it will provide hours of entertaining and educational fun!  Now, DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS???" <br/>
<br/>
Why, it's none other than the Pacific Northwest Letterbox Website!  And it can be yours for the paltry price of simply logging in!!!!  That's right folks! Send no money now, no money down, no payments ever, nothing, nada!!!  Just visit the website and create a new account and you too can be the envy of your neighbors as you become the first on your block to have access to the incredible, stupendous, awesome, one of a kind, never before seen, legal in all 51 states and all US Territories (Void where prohibited), do not fold, spindle or mutilate, do not operate heavy machinery while logged into the website, may cause excitability, take with (or without) food or drink, some settling will occur during shipping, packaged by weight, not volume, your mileage may vary, letterboxing website of the Pacific Northwest Territories!<br/>
<br/>
Come on over to http://www.myndworx.com and see what's in store.  You won't be disappointed, I guarantee! (Offer not valid in the continental United States, Alaska, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands). Log in, and join us for a few, the chairs are soft, the coffee's strong and hot and the sites are breath taking.... The website's not to bad either!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your support!<br/>
