I am pulling the clues for all of my boxes, hidden throughout NJ and <br/>

I did not want that to happen. The clues have been altered, to give <br/>
hints to people, which I find unacceptable. If they are too <br/>
difficult for people to find, then so be it. No one should have the <br/>

I don't blame you one bit. I would hope this is a mistake by the<br/>
person that "adopted" them and that they'll come forward and<br/>
relinquish the ownership...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  No one should have the <br/>

<br/>
I totally agree. It's like an original piece of work, just ridiculous.<br/>
Without the permission of the planter, it's not right.  I have left<br/>
the majority of my boxes in maine. My clues are gone, but I know that<br/>
some folks know the boxes are there. I'd hate to see folks stumble<br/>
across a box and take it upon themselves to put the clues for my lost<br/>
box out there. The boxes all have associated clues. Just because<br/>
you're not privy to them does not mean they're up for grabs. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; I can see now how much the <br/>
&gt; letterboxing community has altered since it's inception, and it's no <br/>

<br/>
What a shame that those who originally came up with these innovative<br/>
ideas and clues are leaving.<br/>

Are you pulling the boxes, too, or just the clues?  We printed some of <br/>
your Maine clues some while ago, in anticipation of a trip to Maine <br/>
later this summer.  <br/>
