<br/>
I wanted to let you know that we tried to find your Heart of Lake<br/>
Washington Box in Mercerdale Park, Mercer Island on Aug. 27, 2003.  We<br/>
took a really, really good look around and couldn't find the box.  I<br/>
hope you can turn it up!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The original Heart of Lake WA letterbox is missing (as confirmed by <br/>
multiple letterboxers who had found it several times prior to its <br/>
disappearance--including us as we visit the spot almost weekly).  I <br/>
recently hid a replacement letterbox, albeit in a slightly different <br/>
location, yet still quite close to the original hiding spot.  You <br/>
can find clues to the replacement box at:  <br/>
www.leecomputers.com/letterboxing  However, I'm unable to amend the <br/>
clues as they are posted on the www.letterboxing.org page because <br/>
Eliza B was the one who originally entered them.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the confusion,<br/>
