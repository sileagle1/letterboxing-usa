&gt; &gt;Does anyone know how long it would take to get to this box<br/>

&gt; From Brattleboro, VT to Bristol VT is about 2 hours 15 minutes if <br/>
you drive like I do.  <br/>
<br/>
We'd be coming up route 89 after dancing in the Boston area on Friday <br/>
night, and also wanted to give anyone else interested in going up <br/>
there to Bristol,VT enough time to get there without rushing, but if <br/>
anyone has a different suggestion for meeting date or time, we're <br/>
certainly open to it.  Otherwise, hope to see you Saturday at 3:00.<br/>

Bring swimsuits, one of New England's hidden wonders is just 0.5 miles up the road.  Swim to, under and inside Bartlett's Falls.  Or perhaps a tube on Circle current, or a jump off Eagle's nest is to your liking.  No fees, just park your car off the pavement.  <br/>
<br/>
Bristol bakery offer bagels, bread and tortes with decent coffee.  Bristol Cliffs diner is worth a visit.  The Bobcat Cafe offers bistro food and designer beer brewed by their sister cafe in Brattleboro.  A  health food store, beeswax candle shop, gallery of local craft artisans, and a head shop offering Nepali clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all your kind thoughts about Erik, he was a delightful man.<br/>
<br/>

Susan Davis<br/>

I'll be over that way, but depending on my SO's hiking speed we may or<br/>
may not make it.  If so, see you there.<br/>
