                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finally back from our 2-day turned 13-day trip to CA.  We managed to <br/>
snag some more letterboxes along the way (up &amp; down I-5).  <br/>
<br/>
Question--"why is it that I seem to attract poison oak like Amanda <br/>
from Seattle attracts hitchhikers???."  Ugh!!!  I'm sick of fighting <br/>
this stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here goes for the box updates from yesterday &amp; today:<br/>
<br/>
Covered Bridge LB Series #2 &amp; #3--alive &amp; well (ran out of time for <br/>
#1)<br/>
Horsetrap Trail (Grants Pass, OR)---alive &amp; well<br/>
Schroeder Park (Grants Pass, OR)--alive &amp; well<br/>
Cedar Hills Twins (Beaverton, OR)--#1 is alive &amp; well, we fizzled <br/>
out on #2<br/>
Old Growth LB (Portland, OR)--we bombed out on it<br/>
Willard S Stump, Willard B Stump (Portland, OR)--both alive &amp; well <br/>
(Willard S was our 300th find!!!)<br/>
What's For Dinner Series (Portland, OR)--alive &amp; well<br/>
Inuit Sun (Portland, OR)--we bombed out on--not sure if it's there <br/>
or not as recent trail maintenance had occurred (obvious pile of <br/>
pulled ivy &amp; blackberry brambles in the vicinity)<br/>
<br/>
Another great letterboxing trek throughout the NW!  What a gorgeous <br/>
time of the year to be boxing, too.  We had nothing but blue skies &amp; <br/>
a whole bunch of sun on our trip!  We even wore shorts along the way-<br/>
-sure missed all the snow out East...  ;)  Maybe next year...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, folks, for several more excellent letterboxes around these <br/>
parts!  See you on the trails...<br/>

PS Ran into a geocacher along the trail for the first time while <br/>
letterboxing.  He said he'd found some letterboxes along the way but <br/>
didn't yet have a stamp.  How obvious it was that he was a geocacher <br/>
(clue sheet in one hand, giant GPS in the other!!!).  Unfortunately, <br/>
our attempt at a real life exchange on the trail fizzled out <br/>
completely.  Too bad for him, he would have gotten three exchanges <br/>
out of the deal...  ;)<br/>
