Grumpy and I have discovered so many bonuses to this new hobby of <br/>
ours.  Not only are we walking and hiking regularly thse days, we <br/>
are discovering the most incredible natural resources all around <br/>
us.  In the past two days we have added two new birds to our birding <br/>
lifelist, found while we were searching for places to plant new <br/>
letterboxes.  We find ourselves walking in nature preserves, among <br/>
giant redwood trees, and along lake shores. <br/>
<br/>
We find we enjoy chatting with other letterboxers online, and look <br/>
forward to meeting some of you in person.  And we are developing our <br/>
creative and artistic "talents" as we plan and carve new stamps.  <br/>
(Well, okay, thanks to some good clip art and pictures traced from <br/>
kids books...)<br/>
<br/>
Our only regret was that in the 13 years we spent in New Hampshire <br/>
we didn't know about letterboxing.  We could have really upped <br/>
our "f" count in New England!!!<br/>
