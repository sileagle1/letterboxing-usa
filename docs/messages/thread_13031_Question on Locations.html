as I ask my question because I've never seen the form used for submitting<br/>
listings :)<br/>
<br/>
Do the cities come as a default list of just a few selections or do the<br/>
people submitting them type in the city name?<br/>
<br/>
I ask because I live in Los Angeles, a very large city, granted, but I'm<br/>
amazed at the sheer number of boxes listed as being in Los Angeles that are<br/>
not only not in the city but not even in the county! I found one listed as<br/>
city of Los Angeles that, when plotted from downtown is 89 miles away and<br/>
you pass through two other counties and over two mountain ranges to get<br/>
there. Another one listed as being within the city of Los Angeles is<br/>
actually on an island quite far away from the city. Actually, you can't even<br/>
get there from Los Angeles, you have to take a boat from Ventura County<br/>
about 2 hours drive north of the city. Makes it tough to actually find ones<br/>
in my area through it all, so I was wondering, as I said, if the people<br/>
listing them are just unable to actually select things like "Riverside" or<br/>
"San Bernardino" or "Crestline" - that's the 89 mile distance one - and are<br/>
forced to just choose Los Angeles as there are no other options. If it was<br/>
just one or two, or all by the same person, I might wonder about their<br/>
navigational skills but, as I said, it is many of them by various people.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and I hope no one is offended by my asking about this, especially the<br/>
person who put the box in Crestline. We do intend to go find it, just on a<br/>
day when we can make a long drive :) The island journey will have to wait<br/>
for our next vacation up the coast :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The county field is chosen off a list and that is what determines <br/>
which region list the box shows up on.  The city field is actually <br/>
something you get to type in, so you can put anything.  I think that <br/>
sometimes people tend to indicate a "nearby" large city so that <br/>
travelers are aware that the box is in the vicinity, although I'm not <br/>
sure that 90 miles would be considered "nearby."<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I have ran across a couple in states I traveled to <br/>
where the city listed was not on the map or known to mapquest, and <br/>
therefore I had a difficult time figuring out where it was.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to use the nearest city that is large enough to be on the <br/>
map.  You can always include additional reference to a nearby larger <br/>
city or tourist area in your clues.<br/>
