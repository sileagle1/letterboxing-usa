<br/>
With all of this renewed discussion about GPS devices, I got to wondering <br/>
whether or not any of my fellow letterboxers makes use of yet another <br/>
by-product of the new technology, namely, hand-held PDAs such as a Palm Pilot <br/>
or a Handspring Visor. Specifically, does anyone store letterboxing clues on <br/>
their PDA and then use the device out on the trails in lieu of printed clues? <br/>
If so, what program do you use? Is it a full text-editing program or a <br/>
read-only program?<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that one of the benefits of this approach - especially for <br/>
someone who regularly uses a PDA in other aspects of his/her daily life - is <br/>
that clues would always be available. Once they've been downloaded (or is it <br/>
uploaded?) to your PDA, clues would be with you all the time every place you <br/>
go (assuming, of course, that you take your PDA with you everywhere, like <br/>
your wallet or your purse or your backpack). No need to remember to print out <br/>
a bunch of clue sheets before leaving for that business trip to Ohio (with <br/>
time set aside for letterboxing, of course) or, worse yet, getting to your <br/>
destination only to realize that you left a pile of printed clues sitting at <br/>
home on the kitchen table! <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, PDA screens aren't exactly large and thus can only display <br/>
a small portion of text at one time, giving the printed cluesheet a distinct <br/>
advantage over a PDA in taking in "the big picture." A long set of <br/>
letterboxing clues would surely necessitate a considerable amount of <br/>
scrolling on a PDA!<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts about this?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I keep LB clues in my Handspring PDA. I do occasionally use it <br/>
while searching for a box. You're right, it's handy because all <br/>
clues are always with me. I just copy and paste a text version of <br/>
the message into the "memo pad" application where I use different <br/>
categories for different states. It's not as great as it could be. <br/>
My PDA crashes so often that I fear being far out on the trail and <br/>
suddenly losing the clues that got me there (oops). The frequent <br/>
crashes are actually a lot worse for more serious information when <br/>
I'm out of town, and just annoying for letterboxing. I look forward to <br/>
a PDA that's as robust and reliable as a piece of paper.<br/>

                    <html><body><p>We tried it for the first time last weekend.  My printer died a few months ago and we needed directions for a couple of new letterboxes nearby, so I downloaded them to my Palm and we were off.  Since I don't use my Palm very regularly (or at all, for that matter), the biggest challenge was figuring out how to download them.  Eventually, I copied and pasted the clues from the website into the Palm Desktop program on my computer and then just ran a sync between the two.  It worked pretty well (except for when I was playing with the Palm in the car and accidently deleted a few lines of the directions).   I liked the fact that I wasn't carrying a bunch of pieces of paper around.  
</p><p>I'm thinking in the future it might be kind of cool to try to download the maps and other information that are on-line for various parks so that we'll have all of those too.  (I hate it when we get to a park and they have run out of maps).
