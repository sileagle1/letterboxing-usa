where that is, it is between Montauk and Orient Points at the east end of<br/>
Long Island.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me if there are any boxes out there?  I know there is one<br/>
listed at Montauk but that is missing.<br/>

some in Brookhaven Park some in Blydenburgh  Park, Smithtown (this is a <br/>
winter series) and one at  Stony Brook  &amp; one at the Morton Wildlife preserve which <br/>
isn't far from the ferry in Sag Harbor. There are some at Orient but I  just <br/>
didn't find that one yet. <br/>
This is a great place to start planting boxes.  So get to it.<br/>
I have planted and got two people who are planting too.<br/>
<br/>
I do most of my boxing in Ct when I visit my son.<br/>
