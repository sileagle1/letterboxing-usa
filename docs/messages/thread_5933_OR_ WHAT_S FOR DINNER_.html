replace Dog #2.  Since we were in the vicinity, it seemed like the<br/>
perfect time to finally hunt down the "What's For Dinner" series.<br/>
<br/>
This series of letterboxes has got to be one of the MOST FUN in the<br/>
Portland area!  Absolutely amusing and delightful!!!  Wonderful<br/>
location, excellent clues, whimsical stamps, and beautiful hiking.  We<br/>
just had a blast.  This would be a good one for families for sure.<br/>
<br/>
A HUGE THANK YOU TO FUNHOG for placing these.  What a hoot!  We had a<br/>
really enjoyable afternoon thanks to these letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
