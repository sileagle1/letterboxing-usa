I'm sure that most of us GET your point, it's just that some of us DISAGREE <br/>
with you.<br/>
I personally am not willing to give in to the trend towards liability <br/>
paranoia and mollycoddling those who lack personal responsibility. Of <br/>
course, we can keep flogging the dead horse all day if we want (It does <br/>
make such a satisfying thump though, doesn't it)<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; We had an old saying among<br/>
 &gt;scout leaders:  the best way to keep the troop together on the trail<br/>
 &gt;is to put the slowest kid in front.  All this rugged individualism<br/>
 &gt;isn't doing our society much good.<br/>
<br/>
Why not just go straight to shackles? Less supervision required.<br/>
You'd definitely get my vote for Office of the Handicapper General.<br/>
But as Randy said, this is getting way off topic, so I'll set my pen aside now.<br/>
