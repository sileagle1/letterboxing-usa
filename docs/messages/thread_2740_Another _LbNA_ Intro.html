Ann saw--and I JUST got interested in letterboxing a few days ago myself! I<br/>
do vaguely remember hearing about the Dartmoor boxes--probably on CBS Sunday<br/>
Morning sometime.<br/>
<br/>
But I am in Wisconsin and it really hasn't caught on here yet--there are a<br/>
few boxes in other areas of the state and at one time at least 3 here in my<br/>
city, but according to the website, 2 of those have gone missing already.<br/>
<br/>
 I just bought erasers and a carving tool today and hope to carve my first<br/>
stamp. My husband said I should have picked up some leather gloves with<br/>
metal mesh on them--does he think I'll cut myself or something?? : ) I am<br/>
not sure I have the correct tool--it is a curved Xacto (vicious looking),<br/>
but the Nasco set, which I was hoping to find, was not at the 2 stores I<br/>
checked today.<br/>
<br/>
Does the letterbox stamp always have to do with the box location? I know I<br/>
read that beginning carvers should start with simple shapes. Is there a good<br/>
book (ANY book) on eraser carving? I seem to remember seeing one advertised<br/>
on the rubberstamp list before--it was Uncle someone, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I will report what I find out when I hunt for the one remaining<br/>
letterbox later this week. It is VERY hot and humid here now--not the ideal<br/>
time to hike.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Welcome to letterboxing!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most people I have seen have stamps with just images my stamp (image<br/>
&gt; attached) has words on it.  One thing to consider is the most common log<br/>
&gt; seems to be a 3x5 index card spiral, you would want to have room for your<br/>
&gt; stamp (or stamps if more than one of you goes letterboxing together and<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; each have a stamp) plus room for the date, perhaps a note and a signature<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; some form.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, I guess I'll jump in here, introduce myself, and ask a few basic<br/>
&gt; questions...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My name's Ann, I live in Southeastern Massachusetts (just over the RI<br/>
state<br/>
&gt; line).  I just learned about Letterboxing 2 or 3 days ago...I am a rubber<br/>
&gt; stamper (greeting cards, etc.) and someone on one of my rubberstamping<br/>
lists<br/>
&gt; brought up the topic of letterboxing.  Imagine my delight when I did a bit<br/>
&gt; of research and found that there are many many letterboxes in New England<br/>
&gt; and other places we frequent.  I told my husband, Eric, about it and he<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; as intrigued as I, and in fact he spent much of last night carving our<br/>
&gt; 'personal stamp'.  I think we will go in search of our first letterbox<br/>
next<br/>
&gt; weekend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please bear with me as I ask some basic newbie questions, answers of which<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; could not find on the websites so far:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.  What are the average dimensions of people's stamps - both personal and<br/>
&gt; in the boxes?  Would anyone care to share examples of personal stamps (I<br/>
&gt; have seen quite a few letterbox stamps).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.  I saw a directory of pooch-friendly letterboxes, is there something<br/>
&gt; simliar for children? (I have a daughter who is 2 and while she loves the<br/>
&gt; outdoors, we are obviously limited in lenght of hike, difficulty of<br/>
terrain,<br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3.  Trish posted about a gathering in New England...what exactly goes on<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; these gatherings?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks, I look forward to being part of the group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ann in MA<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would like to offer to host a letterboxing gathering in Rhode<br/>
&gt; &gt; Island in Sep or Oct.  I think that an ideal site would be Burlingame<br/>
&gt; &gt; State Park.  It is very close to the beach and several LB's.  There<br/>
&gt; &gt; are many trails in the area that don't have boxes that could be added<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the event.  It is a great spot for camping and has a large<br/>
&gt; &gt; covered picnic pavilion that we could reserve for the day.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If anyone is interested or has any ideas please let me know.<br/>

<p><br/>I use either a plain x-acto knife or a linoleum cutter to do my
carving.  I like the x-acto for letters and finer detail work and
the cutter for carving away larger spaces.  But that's just my personal
preference.

Julie Bloch sells a little book about eraser carving (she might be listed
somewhere on the carving consortium website).
<p>I myself don't think the letterbox stamp always has to be related to
the box location, but I think it might be a more valued print if it did
- I think there was a thread related to this many moons ago on this list.

<br/>
We're glad to have you aboard.  Wisconsin is a beautiful state (I<br/>
believe there are several letteroxes in Door County - one of the most<br/>
beautiful and romantic places the country has to offer).  You can<br/>
probably place a bunch of letterboxes in various parts of Wisconsin.  <br/>
<br/>
You don't have to correspond the stamp with the place, though many<br/>
people do.  Some people just carve the word of the place into an eraser<br/>
and that's that.  Others, like my "Who Let the Dogs Out!" series in<br/>
Portland, Oregon, have little to do with where they are placed (except<br/>
you start out on the Dogwood Trail at Forest Park).  Do what feels good<br/>
and what moves you.  Let your imagination take hold and get carving.<br/>
<br/>
I love Wisconsin and hope to get back that way someday.  There is so<br/>
much beauty there and if you start getting things going and spread the<br/>
word, chances are local people there will get excited and want to get<br/>
involved.  I spent a good deal of time in Door County and Tomahawk in<br/>
the 90's and I know there are some very beautiful, unspoiled places to<br/>
place letterboxes.  If you go up to the North Woods to place a box you<br/>
might want to work on a carving of the Wisconsin state bird to plant in<br/>
a letterbox.  If I'm not mistaken that species in the riparian genus<br/>
would be called a MOSQUITO!  HA! HA!<br/>
<br/>

Hee hee, you can get some Kevlar knit gloves which feel just like <br/>
lightweight cotton. Bruce wears them when installing metal stud (he's <br/>
a carpenter). I think you can get them at army surplus and builders <br/>
supply stores. The army stores may sell them as dog-bite gloves.<br/>
