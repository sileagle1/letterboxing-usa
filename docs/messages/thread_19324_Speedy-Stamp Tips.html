                    <div class="plaintext-content">    It's better to cut too little and go back and shave more off, than to gouge too depp and lose material.  If you cut at an angle, so that the edges look like a pyramid's slope, then the raised part is still good, and the base is more solid.  After a while, when I get a good feel for the stamp being 90% done I ink it up and look at the penultimate image.  That's where I see the real irregularities.<br/>

When I do an event stamp I try to put any text portion on one piece <br/>
of pink stuff and the ornate figural part on another.  Then they can <br/>
either be separate stamps or glued onto one piece of wood as a single <br/>
stamp.  I find the text portion has to be done several times, the <br/>
first time being correction of the backwards letters.  Of course I <br/>
have also faced carving all the letters correctly and ending up with <br/>
the word printing backwards.  Talk about left brain right brain <br/>
confusion!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">To avoid mistakes with reversal, you could tape your drawing backwards to a bright window, or hold it against a mirror before beginning to carve.  A very simple, makeshift lightbox can also be made by using a box with holes cut in the sides for ventilation, a fluorescent light strip, and a piece of Plexiglas for the top.  Translucent Plexiglas is best, but clear will work too.  You can also make it translucent by sanding it.  Then you can work on your drawings from either direction with ease by simply flipping them and taping them to the top of the lightbox. You can write your words the usual way, then reverse the whole thing easily.  It helps if the box is shallow enough that your arms aren't going to be way off the work surface.  But in a pinch, a bright window will do nearly as well-- at any art school you would find many students with drawings taped to the window.  I don't feel I'm explaining this very well-- if someone wants to take another shot at it, go ahead!  I see a lot of people trying to actually trying to do mirror-writing because they know it will have to be reversed to come out right. The lettering ends up looking like a child wrote it.  But lettering comes out so much better (unless you are Leonardo...Da Vinci, not DiCaprio!) if you simply do it left to right since that is what you're used to, and reverse the image with a method like this before applying it to the stamp.  If you are one of the people who does the low-tech method of transfer (rubbing the back of the drawing to transfer the graphite to your carving medium), it sure helps to be able to reverse your drawing.  Just copy it darkly onto the other side with the help of the light source behind the paper. Now use this side instead to make the transfer.  Softer pencils transfer easier, but more detail can be gotten with medium ones.  You could try Ebony pencils.  They are very dark, but not so soft.  I haven't tried them for transferring, but they're favorites for drawing.  --lunaryakketyact<br/>

No, that's wrong. Since a reverse image on the stamp makes a correct <br/>
image in ink, it goes vice-versa to make the stamp. A correct image <br/>
on the paper, in graphite, prints the desired reverse image on the <br/>
stamp.<br/>

For my last stamp I printed a photo the size I wanted the stamp, but <br/>
on regular 8.5 x 11 paper, way off center. Scribbled all over the <br/>
back of the picture to make "carbon paper", then folded the paper. <br/>
By tracing the outlines and coloring the dark parts of the photo, I <br/>
got my B&amp;W copy, and the fold let me peek at the results without <br/>
messing up alignment. I then added the lettering to the copy, <br/>
darkened it all and rubbed it off onto the pink stuff.<br/>

 Carve around the design, and it will look exactly as the printed image did, <br/>
