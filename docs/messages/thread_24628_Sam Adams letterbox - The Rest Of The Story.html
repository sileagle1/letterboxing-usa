The original note to me did not specify the box name, just that it <br/>

which of my 200+ boxes it could be.  I didn't even know which state <br/>
to start in.  When I finally figured it out, I looked at the online <br/>

anyone reported it if I lived there and could have saved them the <br/>
trouble of looking for it.  The note was not pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
I know some people don't think boxes should be placed beyond the <br/>
reach of placers to maintain, but when you live in a place as big as <br/>
TX, you get used to doing just that.  So far it has not been a <br/>
problem since most letterboxers are great people and we help each <br/>
other out by replacing things for each other.  If that doesn't <br/>
happen, I update my clues as soon as I'm reasonably sure the box is <br/>
missing.  As I said in my response to the latest note:  You should be <br/>
glad people place boxes for you to find no matter where they are from.<br/>

<br/>
You did far more than I would have in the same situation. Generally I <br/>
will not write "Reported Missing". Instead I write "Could not Find".<br/>
If we get several other "could not find" reports or have another local <br/>
letterboxer verify then it gets deleted.<br/>
<br/>
We have the same problems with our long distance letterboxes and even <br/>
some folks that don't agree with planting long distance boxes should <br/>
understand that without those letterboxes being seeded in those <br/>
letterbox barren regions there would be nothing for a brand new <br/>
letterboxer to find. Plus it is always nice for local boxers when they <br/>
are left a gift from a visiting letterboxer. You can head out west to <br/>
Kernville and leave as many as you like!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I think the real bottom line is that some letterboxers (new?)think that <br/>
it is their right to find every letterbox they search for.<br/>
<br/>
It takes some seasoning for the realization that letterboxing is but a <br/>
slice of life, and you don't always get what you want.<br/>

that thanks to geographical proximity, I've found a lot of SE boxes.<br/>
<br/>
The locations he chooses are usually quite outstanding and almost<br/>
always worth the journey, even if the box itself is missing.  <br/>
<br/>
That said, one of my favorite SE boxes happens to be in San Diego,<br/>
more than 1400 miles away from both of us.  Even halfway across the<br/>
country, he led me to a really neat spot.<br/>
<br/>
This is a game that requires both planters and finders.  Each side<br/>
needs to grant the other a little leeway to make it work.  Planters<br/>
maintain and update the best they can.  There is simply no guarantee<br/>
that the box is going to be there, and if you (not any you<br/>
specifically, but the general "you" out there) can't handle that, this<br/>
is frankly not the right hobby for your tastes.  Try benchmarking or<br/>
markeroni.  Those things aren't going anywhere.<br/>

I maintain that only the placer can determine whether a letterbox is missing.  I'm in B.C., and we had visitors here from Ontario (Norasta) who placed a couple of amazing boxes. Someone went to find one of them, and reported it missing. It wasn't missing at all. It was exactly where the clues said it should be... exaclty where Zara and I found it.<br/>

I agree!  <br/>
<br/>
I am saddened at what seems like finders dictating to placers what <br/>
they need to do (ie. retire a box, remove clues, etc).<br/>
<br/>
If you find the box, great!  If you don't find the box, oh well.<br/>

&gt; As Don said, I'm shocked and annoyed that my private email has gone <br/>
&gt; public, and I now feel like I must comment on it, especially since <br/>
&gt; there is more than meets the eye.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The original note to me did not specify the box name, just that it <br/>
&gt; was in an Arboretum, so the first thing I had to do was determine <br/>
&gt; which of my 200+ boxes it could be.  I didn't even know which state <br/>
&gt; to start in.  When I finally figured it out, I looked at the online <br/>
&gt; log and it showed the last person put "attempted", which made me <br/>
&gt; realize the box was probably missing, even though this was the <br/>
first <br/>
&gt; report I had received, so I updated the clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This would have been the end of it, but the next note I received <br/>
&gt; basically accused me of being irresponsible for placing a box so <br/>
far <br/>
&gt; away from where I live and not being able to care for it.  They <br/>
&gt; seemed to think that I would have known the box was missing before <br/>
&gt; anyone reported it if I lived there and could have saved them the <br/>
&gt; trouble of looking for it.  The note was not pleasant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know some people don't think boxes should be placed beyond the <br/>
&gt; reach of placers to maintain, but when you live in a place as big <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; TX, you get used to doing just that.  So far it has not been a <br/>
&gt; problem since most letterboxers are great people and we help each <br/>
&gt; other out by replacing things for each other.  If that doesn't <br/>
&gt; happen, I update my clues as soon as I'm reasonably sure the box is <br/>
&gt; missing.  As I said in my response to the latest note:  You should <br/>
be <br/>
&gt; glad people place boxes for you to find no matter where they are <br/>
from.<br/>

<br/>
Personally, I think boxes placed by folks outside the area can be great.<br/>
Even in areas that do have quite a few boxes already, boxes from<br/>
"out-of-towners" can give boxers a chance to see someone else's work and<br/>
maybe take away some new ideas for the future.<br/>
<br/>
It can be a problem if a box is possibly missing, I would suppose.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that could be asked on the regional list for wherever that box is<br/>
located is to see if anyone who's already found the box is close enough to<br/>
go check it out, since they already know where it's supposed to be.  But I<br/>
think this would meet with more success on the regional list than on the<br/>
national list.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea is to maybe put it in the clues that the placer is from out of<br/>
the area, so the finder knows that they'll be "taking their chances" more<br/>
than usual.  But that's certainly not required -- personally, I wouldn't<br/>
even consider it rude not to do it.<br/>
<br/>
But it's one of those "oh well" moments.  We're headed out to Starved Rock<br/>
in Utica, IL for a couple of days and some of the boxes listed have a<br/>
placement date of 2004, which is awhile ago.  I'm kinda figurin' that we<br/>
might have some "oh well" moments.  :-)<br/>

Hey, at least you have an excuse.<br/>
<br/>
Every time I try to go &amp; check on my "Two Brothers &amp; A Sheriff" box, I have<br/>
to call the Cook County Forest Preserve office, get hold of the guy who<br/>
handles their historical research department, and he has to remind me of<br/>
just where the starting point is to finding my box.  Once I've got the<br/>
starting point, it all comes together &amp; makes sense, but thankfully, he's a<br/>
very sweet and patient guy about getting me to the starting point.  :-)<br/>
