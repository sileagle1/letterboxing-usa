First a big Thank You goes to Gaabriel for hosting the event. I was so glad <br/>
we held to the date. Three beautifully carved event stamps<br/>
grace my logbook. It certainly looked like everyone was having a good time. <br/>
We had young Happy Homeschoolers, little Be and Ma, and a the very young <br/>
crickets jumping gleefully amongst us.<br/>
         I wish I could have spent more time visiting with, Na, Gaabriel, <br/>
Happy Homeschool Mom, Shell of Knights of Columbo, and Knitwitmominmaryland <br/>
and the Turtle Trekkers. Maybe at the next gathering!<br/>
         Like the old Girl Scout song, " Make new friends but keep the old!" <br/>
It was great to see CelticPride, Firefly (Daarling, you look marvelous!), <br/>
Squirrel, Doubtfull Guests, Witchiepoo, Sam I Am, Mary the Daughter of the <br/>
Old Dominion, Tempusfugit, Claire de Lune, Schizokeet, and  D &amp; Shoo. I <br/>
think that's it from the previous meet/greets.<br/>
         Missed, but not forgotten were the Appledumpling Gang and the <br/>
Forest Frog Family. Congrats on the birth of your new tadpole. Hope to see <br/>
you on the trail with all your little croakers!<br/>
         Finally got to meet the elusive Dead Duck Chuck. Love your stamp!<br/>
         It was a great treat meeting Sadie and Russ from CT. Funny how they <br/>
started l'boxing the same time as Princess Turtle and I/me (never could get <br/>
it right so pick the correct one) and they have a PFX count over 500.<br/>
         Then comes Wanda, breezing through. PT and I felt honored to be <br/>
included with the New England group to go hunting the Riverbend boxes. Just <br/>
the day before Wanda had found 13 in PA and 3 that morning before the <br/>
Gathering.<br/>
          I know how she does it!!!!!!!! After observing her technique, I <br/>
believe she has had a radar tracking device implanted. I guess after finding <br/>
2000, you develop a 6th sense for snffing out boxes. It doesn't hurt that <br/>
little wings spring from her ankles and POOF - there she goes! Like Mercury <br/>
the messinger.<br/>
          Our little hunting party comprised of Scarab, Night Owl, Sadie &amp; <br/>
Russ, Princess Turtle and me, Psychomommy. The sky looked threatening so we <br/>
decided to attempt Rich's boxes that he so thoughtfully planted for the <br/>
event. I was wearing my flip/flops and figured it would be 2 quick finds, so <br/>
I didn't bother changing into hiking shoes. Silly me, 2 boxes turned into 5. <br/>
Actually the flip/flops were quite comfortable.<br/>
          Along the trail I suddenly discovered I had lost my glasses. So I <br/>
backtracked my steps and couldn't find them. Sadie and Wanda came back to <br/>
help me look. Well Wandas radar was up and working. Amazingly she walks to a <br/>
spot, stopped, looked down and said, "Here they are!" So now I can add to my <br/>
R count. Wanda to my rescue!<br/>
          It was a great day and I hope to meet more New England Boxers in <br/>
the future. Thanks to all who braved the day despite the threat of <br/>
tunderstorms. As Russ kept saying the Tornados. Charming!<br/>
          Psychomommy and Princess Turtle<br/>
          P30   F129   -F2   X102    V3    E6    C0    R2    SS1   and the <br/>
ever lovin'  L9<br/>
