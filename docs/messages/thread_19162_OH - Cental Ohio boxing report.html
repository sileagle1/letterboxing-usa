                    <div class="plaintext-content">We made a late afternoon jaunt up to Lockville yesterday and were<br/>
pleased to be first finders of 3 new letterboxes there.  There's a<br/>
charming little park off the beaten path in a tiny old canal village<br/>
where 3 of the old lock chambers of the Ohio &amp; Erie canal are located.<br/>
 There's also a covered bridge that was moved to the park from another<br/>
location.  There are also about 10 billion ravenous mosquitos if you<br/>
get there at dusk!  Remember the bug repellant!  We found the<br/>
"Ohio-Erie Canal Locks 11,12,13" boxes (there are 2) and the "Hartman<br/>
II - Built Funk Tough" box with no problem except that it's very hard<br/>
to stamp in while swatting mosquitos with both hands.  Nice stamps and<br/>
a lovely little park we'd probably never have found otherwise.  It's<br/>
what 'boxing is all about!  We also inadvertently found a geocache<br/>
while looking for the boxes - a little bonus!  Hope you all are having<br/>
fun too!<br/>
