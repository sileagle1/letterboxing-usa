history, it took letterboxing and Jay's great mystery to spark an <br/>
interest in the Civil War.  A trip to the library and a little <br/>
resesarch led me to Bartholomew's resting spot.  Heading out after <br/>
work, I had to make a hard drive like Sheridan to beat the dark.  <br/>
Upon stamping in, I was joined by two young civil war ghost hunters, <br/>
armed with cap guns and rifles.  I tucked the box into my pack and <br/>
listened to their tales of distant drum beats and musket fire.  When <br/>
they were satisfied that I was sure I'd heard the same thing, they <br/>
headed down the trail wishing me happy trails.  The box tucked safely <br/>
back in it's hiding spot, I headed home feeling pretty good about <br/>
having found this box.  Thanks, Jay....nice job!<br/>
