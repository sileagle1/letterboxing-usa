big event last weekend.  What a welcome surprise!!!  The event <br/>
stamps all really enjoyed getting together for a brief moment in <br/>
time!  The two opi 41 (is opi the plural of opus?) ala legerdemaine <br/>
also got to reunite for a brief moment in time.  Perhaps there was <br/>
two! much of a good thing with both K-Marthas in attendance?  ;)  It <br/>
was great to see such awesome works of art!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your assistance in making Saturday's South Sound LB <br/>
Quest Fest such a fun and exciting event!<br/>

&gt; So, did y'all know that I sent out (with Funhog's assist) a <br/>
roaming event <br/>
&gt; stamp?  The intent being gathering events stamps in its log pages <br/>
and sharing <br/>
&gt; the silly LbNW stamp I did at the Macleay Park, Oregon gathering <br/>
in August.  <br/>
&gt; Wouldn't it be nice to see all the other event stamps that have <br/>
come and gone?<br/>
