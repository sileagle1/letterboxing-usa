carved.  I am also quite sure that the carving medium that I have <br/>
been using will not do what you have been able to do with your <br/>
stamps.  Please, what are you using?  I have been using the <br/>
speedball pink stuff (dont remember the name)  It works ok but <br/>
is not as stiff as it needs to be.  The other stiffer things I have <br/>
tried are way too crumbly.  Help!?<br/>

Thank you (I was fairly proud of them as well),  I am afraid that I <br/>
am not much of an artist.  Yes, I am good with my hands and can <br/>
carve fairly well, but I'm afraid what my stamps lack is artistry.... <br/>
I'm not sure that is something that I will be able to overcome <br/>
(whether I have better carving material or not).  Still, stamp <br/>
carving IS fun.  And that is really what it is all about.  I am working <br/>
on the artistry part, and just got some good advice from alafair.<br/>
