</b><p>Mariners Museum (4)</p>
<p>Mariners Museum Park</p>
<p>Newport News, VA</p>
<p>City of Newport News</p>
<p>Placed September 26, 2002 by Cardweaver</p>
<p>Clues: Easy</p>
<p>Terrain: Easy 5.0 miles (Stroller Accessible w/ a few bumps)</p><i>
</i><p>All headings are magnetic.</p>
<p>Directions: I-64 to exit 258A (US 17 South/J. Clyde Morris Blvd). Stay on J. 
Clyde Morris Blvd all the way to the end. The Mariners Museum is located at 
Warwick Blvd (US 60) &amp; J. Clyde Morris Blvd in Newport News. Park in the 
Noland Trail parking lot and make your way the Noland Trail near the North 
Entrance. Be sure to take water along, as the only water fountain is at the 
trailhead.</p>
<p>Box #1: Follow the Noland trail to me. </p>
<p>As you cross the bridges, they'll be numbered you will see. </p>
<p>Prior to Bridge three on the left I will be. </p>
<p>At the top of a small trail, at the left of the "T".</p>
<p>Box #2: Continuing on the main trail, pass a granite pine cone on the right. 
At the "Y" marked for the Oak Tree Overlook, take the right hand trail. Pass the 
granite oak leaf and stop at the rail. At the wooden "Y" turn to 320. A dozen 
steps then turn to 140. Take the trail on the left. At the next intersection 
turn to 160. Past 2 picnic tables and across the bridge from which you can see 
me in abundance. Passed 8?, you're too late! At the resting spot, take the trail 
that heads east. Walk for a while, it must be a century at least! From a tree on 
the left with a hole at the base, at 50 take 9 steps to a tall oak or 10 just 
in case. Towards 100 step the directions square root to a rather tall tree with 
a shy neighbor, somewhat aloof. Now, for the triskadecaphobes, I do apologize, 
for this number of steps you must exercise. For a heading, add 1 and multiply by 
10, then the search for me will be at an end. Though not a bird, at the base of 
a large tree I roost, somewhere amongst all of the exposed roots.</p>
<p>Box #3: Continue on the main trail SE. At the log-lined path, take a break.  
way there? After the next section of log-lined trail, take 37 steps. At 130 is 
a hollow stump. Although the battle took place south of here, here lies the 
resting place of the Ironclad that Southerners revere.</p>
<p>Box #4: After Eleven, at the "Y" go left. You're not at a zoo, but at Leo go 
right, another carnivore? another right! Pass the equine statuary. Stay in the 
shade, avoid the meadow.</p>
<p>Two benches, a Loblolly pine and a wooden bump occurs. At 240, behind two 
large firs. Beneath the end of a rotting log, is the resting place of the 
Ironclad, the Federals' first!</p>
<p>Continue on the trail to the museum.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
