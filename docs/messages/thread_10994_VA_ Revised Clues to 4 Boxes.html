in Richmond, VA. Thanks!<br/>

Forest Hill Park Letterboxes<br/>
<br/>
Four letterboxes have been planted in Forest Hill Park in the City of<br/>
Richmond's Southside. This is a heavily used urban park, so be very<br/>
discreet when stamping in and rehiding. Also be alert to mountain<br/>
bikers when going after Boxes 1 and 3.<br/>
<br/>
All boxes were originally placed by mlgainey on September 4, 2002.<br/>
Eventually, three of them were snatched and have since been replaced.<br/>
<br/>
Box #1 -- The Trolley<br/>
<br/>
Park on Stonewall Avenue near the Holden Rhodes House. In the early<br/>
1800s, Holden Rhodes owned the land that we now call Forest Hill Park.<br/>
  Cross the open grassy area, walking away from the house. Walk down<br/>
the hill that Richmonders love to sled down on the rare occasions when<br/>
it snows in Richmond. <br/>
<br/>
Walk down these hills until you reach the paved walkway that winds<br/>
through Forest Hill Park. At the stone steps on your left, go off the<br/>
walkway. Walk straight ahead to the two mountain bike trails at the<br/>
edge of the woods. Take the trail that forks to the left. At another<br/>
fork, you will see a large, uprooted tree across from a stone wall. A<br/>
smooth, fallen tree lies under and behind the uprooted tree. The box<br/>
is hidden underneath leaves and bark beside the smooth fallen tree.<br/>
This stamp represents the fact that Forest Hill Park was the last stop<br/>
on the Forest Hill trolley line over 100 years ago. Please recover the<br/>
box very well. <br/>
<br/>
Box #2 --  The Amusement Park<br/>
<br/>
THIS IS A MICRO BOX. IT DOES NOT CONTAIN A PENCIL. <br/>
<br/>
Take the stone path at the stone wall across from Box 1 down the hill.<br/>
Go right on the paved walkway. Go off the main walkway once more to<br/>
your left and cross the bridge. Go to your right toward another<br/>
section of the paved walkway as well as toward a dirt trail. Go right<br/>
on the dirt trail.<br/>
<br/>
Take the dirt trail to a chain link fence. Box #2 is hidden in a<br/>
hollow under a small boulder across from the very beginning of this<br/>
fence. A thin tree and a couple of dead vines are very close to it.<br/>
The box is covered with leaves. Please recover the box very well.<br/>
<br/>
This box commemorates that Forest Hill Park was an amusement park in<br/>
the early 1900s. <br/>
<br/>
Box #3 -- The Sled<br/>
<br/>
THIS IS A MICRO BOX. IT DOES NOT CONTAIN A PENCIL. <br/>
<br/>
Retrace your steps, and at the end of the dirt trail, go to your right<br/>
back onto the main paved walkway. Take it past another bridge to its<br/>
end. You'll be on another dirt trail.<br/>
<br/>
Take the mountain bike trail on your right. Then take the trail on<br/>
your left. At the fork, take the left fork. Begin looking on your left<br/>
for a double-trunked tree with a very tall stump behind it. Box 3 is<br/>
hidden in a hole in the middle of the tall stump, covered with leaves<br/>
and bark. Please rehide very well.<br/>
<br/>
Remember those hills you came down on your way to Box 1? This stamp<br/>
goes along with them.<br/>
<br/>
Box #4 -- The Mountain Bike<br/>
<br/>
Go to your left back on the mountain bike trail. At the fork, continue<br/>
to your left. The trail will come out onto a gravel path. Take it to<br/>
your right.<br/>
<br/>
Cross the cement bridge on your left and take the path. Begin looking<br/>
on your right for a tree with a large hole at its base, in front of<br/>
which is a small, spindly holly tree. Additionally, two pairs of<br/>
double-trunked trees stand behind the tree with the hole, and an<br/>
additional double-trunked tree will be across from it. Box 4 is hidden<br/>
in this hole, covered with leaves and sticks. Please rehide well.<br/>
<br/>
The stamp represents one of the many mountain bike trails in this<br/>
park. Forest Hill Park is the site of one of the Xterra contests every<br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the Reedy Creek box is within walking distance of these<br/>
boxes. Retrace your steps to the gravel path and take it to your left.<br/>
Take the gravel path to its end onto Riverside Drive. To your left and<br/>
across Riverside is the entrance.<br/>
<br/>
Or you can get back to your car by continuing on this trail, which<br/>
ends in the shelter parking lot. Walk to your right through the<br/>
parking lot, and as you near its end, you will see the Old Stone House<br/>
and your car.<br/>
