Franklin Canyon Park, north of Beverly Hills, is part of the Santa Monica<br/>
Mountains Conservancy, charged with saving what is left of the only mountain<br/>
range inside of a major city. The park is open seven days a week, 365 days a<br/>
year, from sunrise to sunset. As it is a natural area, be aware that there<br/>
may be snakes, deer, coyotes, foxes, and very pushy waterfowl and squirrels.<br/>
<br/>
Box/Series Difficulty<br/>
This series takes you on a loop of just over one mile. It was rated moderate<br/>
for families/disabled persons because there are several steep stairways<br/>
(fully built out with railings) and in one section, you will have to do some<br/>
navigation around small to medium rocks. The rock area is not safe for<br/>
wheeled transportation and would present difficulty for the visually<br/>
impaired. There are also several areas where you will need to traverse up<br/>
and down primitive stairs, though all have hand railings.<br/>
