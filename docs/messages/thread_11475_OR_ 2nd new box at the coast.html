Eight-year-old Wild Child drew the stamp image and planted this letterbox on <br/>
the lovely Redwood Nature trail.  <br/>
<br/>
Directions: From the north end of the Chetco River bridge on Highway 101 in <br/>
Brookings, turn inland at the sign that reads “Azalea City Park/Leob State <br/>
Park,” onto Constitution; make a right onto North Bank Road, following the <br/>
signs to Leob State Park. Continue following the signs for about 7 miles.  <br/>
<br/>
Decide if you want to make this a longer or shorter hike.  <br/>
<br/>
If you prefer a longer hike (about 2.5 miles roundtrip), park at Loeb State <br/>
Park (there’s probably a fee, but I don’t know how much it is.)  The <br/>
Riverview Trail starts from here.  After a bit more than .5 mile, the path <br/>
ends at the road.  Cross over to the Redwood Nature Trail and follow the <br/>
clues from there.<br/>
<br/>
OR, if you’d prefer a shorter hike, continue driving about .5 mile beyond <br/>
Leob State Park to the Redwood Nature Trail sign, and park there.  (You’ll <br/>
need a NW Forest Park pass, or you can pay $5.00 at the trailhead.)  The <br/>
trail is a 1.2 mile loop trail. <br/>
<br/>
Clues: Go to #9.  After admiring the redwood, look behind you at the sword <br/>
fern.  Hidden under its fronds, and beneath a small log, is the #9 letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you remember, you might drop a note to the LBNA list-serve or to <br/>
pnwexplr@aol.com if you find this box—we don’t know when we’ll get back to <br/>
check on it.  Thanks!<br/>
