Kartchner Caverns appears to be gone as all we found was the bottom half of<br/>

Too much snow and mud to try the Superstition Mountains - maybe next year.<br/>

So sorry about the missing Kartchner Cavern box.  Losses happen and since it<br/>
was an orphan box we just had to hope it would have lasted longer.  It was<br/>
only in place 6 weeks or so.  Yes,  the fees to the site are expensive and<br/>
it is a long drive unless you have prepurchased tickets to Caverns.  Glad to<br/>
hear that "Summer Storm is doing OK.  Gwen and Don<br/>

I hope your next trip has better weather.  The Superstition Mountains<br/>
box has got to be one of the most rewarding letterboxes I've done.<br/>
