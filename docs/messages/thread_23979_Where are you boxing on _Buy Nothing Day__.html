I'm glad you are doing this!  I had wanted to keep up the tradition of<br/>
planting a new box or 2 every BNDay but will not be able to this year.<br/>
 Here is my effort last year:<br/>

time to box the rest of the weekend.  And, frankly, it's one of the best<br/>

<br/>
Decades ago, the day after Christmas used to be the best people-watching day<br/>
of the year.  But Black Friday has overtaken it.  After the first major<br/>
crushrush, I like to sit in that little cafe inside Fry's Electronics, have<br/>
hot chocolate and an avocado sandwich for breakfast, and watch folks.<br/>
<br/>
Y'know, that's something to think about for next year.  A letterbox hidden<br/>
inside Fry's that's only available on Black Friday just for kicks.  With all<br/>
the commotion, a finder could probably stamp away right in the middle of the<br/>
store and absolutely nobody would pay any attention.  Hide it the day before<br/>
&amp; pick it up the day after.  Gotta make a note to myself for next year.  :-)<br/>
Wouldn't really expect to get any finders but it would be fun to do.<br/>

Now THAT'S the spirit!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanksgiving is the holiday, not Black Friday.  I have to work on Friday <br/>
and I don't even work retail (though I did it for 7 years).  Yes, it <br/>
would be nice if you could take everyday off to spend with your family <br/>
in the great outdoors, but you can't, that is just the way it is.  Even <br/>
FDR, the great socialist, knew the importance of the consumer economy as <br/>
he wanted to move Thanksgiving up in November to extend the holiday <br/>
shopping season (not that it matters these days).<br/>
<br/>
I would rather we have the steam rolling economy then the double digit <br/>
unemployment and low growth rate of the European nations...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, wait, I'm doing it...<br/>
<br/>
Have a Happy Thanksgiving!<br/>
<br/>
(and do lots of shopping tomorrow!)<br/>
