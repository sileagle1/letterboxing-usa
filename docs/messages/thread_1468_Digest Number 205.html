Wow, nobody told my son and I that when we found it in late August, I <br/>
believe it was. It wasn't in the exact spot, but it was near enough and <br/>
visible enough for us to find. We had considerable difficulty finding the <br/>
appropriate bridges and when we did the box was in an out of bounds area, <br/>
at the time. Maybe it has been declared lost since. Wish I had a chance to <br/>
get out there for a look see. I can advise Jay as to where I found it if <br/>
necessary.<br/>
