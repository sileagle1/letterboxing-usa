                    <div class="plaintext-content">First of all, thanks, Pete, for putting out the two<br/>
cats' letterbox for our 2nd LB anniversary! We love<br/>
our cats, and letterboxing, too! In fact, had it not<br/>
been for letterboxing giving us some external fun<br/>
focus these past 2 years, we probably would have had a<br/>
much harder time dealing with the various types of<br/>
illness that have afflicted the last remains of both<br/>
our families of origin, so thanks again to everyone<br/>
who planted boxes and helped "keep us going"! Thanks<br/>
also to everyone who responded and wished us well. No,<br/>
we don't have any intention of trying to make a mark<br/>
on the other side of the pond, but just wanted to show<br/>
what is now possible with a little effort on THIS side<br/>
of the pond! And as time goes on, of course, it will<br/>
become more and more attainable! (Just ask Randy how<br/>
hard it was to have to travel all around the US in<br/>
1999 to become the first person to get 100 boxes over<br/>
here, and now you can practically do it in one CT town<br/>
in one weekend!) Anyway, we do hear that it is quite<br/>
a different game over there, and that there is even<br/>
someone over there who has found so many boxes that<br/>
people call him "God", but that is definitely not our<br/>
cup of tea! (though I'd certainly love to be going<br/>
over to Dartmoor next month with Alan just for a sip!)<br/>
At any rate, our drink of choice right now seems to be<br/>
hot cocoa! We had a great time "ski-boxing" the past<br/>
few weeks at places like the Tri-State area("RI<br/>
Compass") and Paine Open Space(CT "Mixed Nuts"), and<br/>
have continued to box right straight through all this<br/>
incredibly cold weather we've been having! ( In fact,<br/>
it's been so cold that quite a few boxes have<br/>
unfortunately become brittle and cracked - like 4 out<br/>
of 10 in Alan's super CT "Peanuts" series - so this<br/>
year is definitely not going to be like last winter<br/>
for box survival rate :-( One of ours cracked, too,<br/>
and Alan graciously replaced it for us, but I'm sorry<br/>
to say I didn't even have any extra ziplocs with me<br/>
that day, so hopefully the next folks to visit can do<br/>
that!) Anyway, it just so happened that my 2000th box<br/>
was Laurette's "Coffee Break", preceded directly by a<br/>
cool surprise box called "Morning Coffee" left near<br/>
one of our boxes, and preceded a few months before<br/>
that by a hitcher called "Top Java"! Pretty funny<br/>
considering that I don't even drink coffee...but I am<br/>
now ready for a "letterboxing break"! February looks<br/>
to be taken up with another end-to-end on the<br/>
Catamount Trail (the length of VT on skis, if the snow<br/>
complies!) and then mid-March starts my regular hiking<br/>
season down South and out West. I'll try to keep my<br/>
hand in the 'boxing a little as time permits, but I<br/>
don't expect to have much. Mostly I just wanted to<br/>
reach that US "2000 in 2 years" personal goal of mine<br/>
as an incentive to show those folks who do like the<br/>
numbers what is already within reach! So, happy trails<br/>
to all, and hope to see some of you in the fall!!!<br/>

                    <html><body>Gosh, Wanda, you'll really have your work cut out for you if you go off hiking for several months. Just think of all the new boxes that will await upon your return to New England!!  At one time I thought of doing all of Ct first and thenmoving on but soon decided that I would never keep up with all the new plantings.  And with all the snow we've had I bet there is a lot of plotting and planting scheduled for spring.<br/>
Happy Hiking<br/>
