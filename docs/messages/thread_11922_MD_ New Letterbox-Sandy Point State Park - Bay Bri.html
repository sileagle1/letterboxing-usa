This is a good one to stop at if you are headed to the Shore or the Northeast via the Bay Bridge, for a quick rest.  The park is located at the exit off of US 50/301 just east of the Bay Bridge Toll Plaza.<br/>
<br/>
You will need to pay $1 gate fee to enter the park with exact change-it is an automated toll machine!  If you try to park outside the gate and walk in, the park ranger will make you move your car, as he did for me!<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you go into the park to the beaches to check out the views of the Bay Bridge.  I tried to hide the box within view of the bay, but there were no good hiding spots!<br/>
<br/>
Immediately after paying the fee, there are about 5 parking spaces to your right.  Try to park here.  If not possible, park in one of the lots further into the park and walk back to the tollgate area.<br/>

We placed 6 boxes - 2 each in 3 different locations (Tuckahoe State Park and Wye Island NRMA are not too far over the Bridge, Eastern Neck Wildlife Refuge is a bit more of a drive, but worth the trip!) Sorry for the shameless plug...we just had a whole lot of fun placing these last November, and the area is beautiful. Mama Frog<br/>
