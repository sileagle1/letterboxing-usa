sincere apologies go to Sunseeker and DZ if they have been offended <br/>
by my mistake in giving someone else credit for the Finish Line <br/>
Letterbox at Ft. Steilacoom.<br/>
<br/>
This is an honest mistake and was not intentional. I have found over <br/>
10 of the letterboxes and several hitchhikers in the park this past <br/>
week and was working off the top of my head when posting on the list. <br/>
I didn't have the exact clues in front of me at the time. <br/>
<br/>
My mistake...I guess I will make sure to not post a generalized <br/>
update on my enjoyable day(s) of letterboxing with out having the <br/>
clues for each and every box I find in front of me..don't want to <br/>
risk offending someone!!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'll just refrain from sharing my fun on the main list and just <br/>
contact the placers to let them know I enjoyed finding their box. <br/>
<br/>
Heaven forbid someones feathers get ruffled over an honest mistake.<br/>

this list, I'm a bit behind as I've been buried in front of a program I am<br/>
writing for my Brother and it's been kicking my, well...... You know!<br/>
(Grin) and I've not been able to read my emails as often.  Or perhaps it is<br/>
the woodworking I've been doing recently as well... Making handmade wooden<br/>
clocks and Cuckoo clocks does take time. (smiles)<br/>
<br/>
Before I could let MiniBullyMom know that we are but the maintainer's of the<br/>
aforementioned box, SSLF, and not the original placers, someone else<br/>
apparently made sure that MiniBullyMom knew she had made a mistake.....<br/>
<br/>
So, let me clarify.  We have adopted most of SunSeeker's boxes in our<br/>
immediate area as his was the first box we discovered that got us hooked on<br/>
this hobby.  When we discovered that his boxes were listed as 'abandoned' we<br/>
immediately adopted them. Just recently, SunSeeker got in touch with us and<br/>
we have conversed about his boxes. We have come to the arrangement that we<br/>
will continue to maintain them for him, and he is going to (read: Planning<br/>
on) replacing the missing Foothills Trail ones and the Catch Me as well.<br/>
<br/>
Now, since the Main LBNA website does not list original placer when someone<br/>
else adopts a box, then I can well see why MiniBullyMom made her error. I<br/>
mean, after all, the website lists us as the placer.  Innocent mistake,<br/>
which, like many others, is quickly jumped upon.<br/>
<br/>
MiniBullyMom, no worries, we know you meant to thank the placer/maintainer<br/>
of that box when you located it, and, since we ARE listed at the LBNA<br/>
website as the 'Placers' your missive is in no way a mistake, in our<br/>
opinion.  We shall make sure that SunSeeker, the next we speak, knows of<br/>
your praise and thanks.<br/>

normally do not read the list at the Yahoo site, to cumbersome for <br/>
my tastes. Anyways, now that I get a chance to read it, let me <br/>
respond to her post:<br/>
<br/>
Very true, very true indeed.  No, we did not replace the stamp, the <br/>
original still exists. And yes, we did take of the box as it was <br/>
listed as abandonded on the main site, so I can well see where <br/>
MiniBullyMom got Rayvenhaus as the Placer of that box, it's how it's <br/>
listed at the Main LBNA website.  And I do thank you for pointing <br/>
out that credit should be given to the original creator of the <br/>
stamp, as it is, after all, their stamp in the box, not mine.  All <br/>
I'm doing is maintaining it, restocking as needed, etc, etc. No <br/>
thanks are needed by myself for those actions.<br/>
<br/>
But thank you very much Paisley Orca for ensuring that the original <br/>
placer of the box gets the allocades and the credit.  I would have <br/>
done it had I seen the original message before you.  (smiles)<br/>
<br/>
Let's all relax folks, there was a simple misunderstanding made <br/>
here, that's all.. Nothing to see... Everyone move on.  (grin!)<br/>
