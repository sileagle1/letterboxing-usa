Dinosaur State Park in Rocky Hill, CT.<br/>
<br/>
It was a great day and a wonderful nature walk...<br/>
<br/>
The Trilobite Letterbox was a bit damp and the book is filled, but I was <br/>
able to squeeze my stamp in a place.<br/>
<br/>
The Eubrontes Letterbox is in bad shape...the logbook was still there, but <br/>
someone swiped the stamp and pad.  Too bad, the picture of the stamp in the <br/>
book shows that it was a good stamp.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is also the Native Flower Letterbox there, but it is a different <br/>
person placing it and a different set of clues...That box is in great shape.<br/>
<br/>
Later,<br/>
