found two had been dragged some distance away from their hiding places -- <br/>
by animals, I assume. Who Cooks For You? was one and when I went to <br/>
replace it,  not having the clues with me, I may have put it under the first rather <br/>
than the second sycamore. I will remedy this next weekend; meanwhile, if <br/>
you're looking for it, you may find it under the first tree.<br/>
