&gt;  ...I would love to hear feedback on a<br/>
&gt;  specific subject: Group or individual<br/>
&gt;  opinion on custom (commercial) stamps vs.<br/>
&gt;  hand-carved original stamps in letterboxes.<br/>
&gt;  I truly understand the value and aesthetic<br/>
&gt;  appeal of hand-carved stamps (and plan to<br/>
&gt;  do my own carvings), but... there is<br/>
&gt;  discussion here about box vandalism,<br/>
&gt;  and so I cringe at the thought of<br/>
&gt;  spending hours on a stamp only to<br/>
&gt;  have it swiped or destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
I think to date we are only certain of two<br/>
or three incidents of vandalism and I think<br/>
we have concluded that two of those were <br/>
due to the boxes being out in the open. <br/>
So I don't know that this is a huge problem.<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless, its a valid concern and I'm<br/>
glad you are offering suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I guess<br/>
&gt;  my question is: since many people<br/>
&gt;  prize collecting original stampings,<br/>
&gt;  would it lessen the experience to<br/>
&gt;  have a commercially-made COPY of the<br/>
&gt;  original carving in the box?<br/>
<br/>
I don't think it would lessen the experience<br/>
for most.  Some people like viewing the stamp<br/>
right up front on the web page.  A while back<br/>
we had all kinds of creative suggestions to<br/>
deal with this issue, even a suggestion to<br/>
just leave a note in the box with instructions<br/>
on who to contact to get the stamp image.<br/>
<br/>
We did have one suggestion that was looked upon<br/>
with very much disdain -- that was the infamous<br/>
and dreaded "cyberbox".  It would have been a<br/>
code which you could use at a website to get a<br/>
virtual stamp image.  I can see why this one<br/>
went over especially poorly with the artists,<br/>
those who value the sensual experience of seeing<br/>
the work close up.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  On a personal note, due to my recent disability,<br/>
&gt;  I will likely be unable to access many<br/>
&gt;  letterboxes that are located in excessively<br/>
&gt;  rough terrain... at least for a while.<br/>
&gt;  If any of you are actively planting boxes<br/>
&gt;  around here and there, I would love see<br/>
&gt;  clues indicate those boxes that are easily<br/>
&gt;  accessible. Thank you to the clue-givers that<br/>
&gt;  are descriptive about the level of terrain<br/>
&gt;  difficulty in your clues.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle, our input form will have a place for<br/>
this bit of information.  All agreed, I think,<br/>
that this was a very good idea.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the input form currently being suggested is<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/testform.htm<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your constructive comments and again,<br/>
welcome to our group.<br/>

<br/>
For now just email them to me<br/>
mailto:elf@pclink.com<br/>
This actually is easier for you than<br/>
filling out the form because it leaves it up to me to format<br/>
them, create the page and link it to the map.  You just freeform<br/>
them in an email and I do the rest.  I'm hoping<br/>
to have the above form or one like it available in the near<br/>
future.  But, as always, the new feature will be scrutinized<br/>
by the group to determine if it meets their needs or not<br/>
before being implemented.  So if you have any ideas for the new<br/>
form please pass them on.  I'm interested in hearing what you<br/>
have to say.  Your ideas matter.<br/>
<br/>
But for now all I need is your clues and/or directions to<br/>
your letterbox hiding site, the name of the letterbox and the<br/>
place description (park, nearby city or latitude/longitude).<br/>
I can almost always get a map from that information.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
and I loved it............It's great !!!!!<br/>
<br/>
It's that "letterboxing moment"..all the log books, plastic boxes and bits<br/>
and pieces ... The serious expressions...just been there ..just done that<br/>
..just isn't it great !!!!   :-)<br/>
<br/>
Totally fun, totally simple pleasure...and it looks like such a cool and<br/>
leafy place....I expect a unicorn to wander into that glade behind you, at<br/>
any moment...<br/>
<br/>
Your links are nice too...the site is looking good...I claim 19th place !<br/>
<br/>
I'm extremely pleased  to see a link to my very wonderful friends Ray and<br/>
Hazel Aucote.....Did you realise that the pictures of the stamps on their<br/>
page that flip up, were found ( and put up there ) by Dancing Dragon...see<br/>
L-USA Kids Page !<br/>
<br/>
(A Hunters Tale :  Ray &amp; Hazel have 3 dog stamps on the moor (quite close<br/>
together).  We have found 2 of them but just can't find the third..So I<br/>
receive a lot of email humour at my expense about the "Lost Dogs On The<br/>
Moor Stamp" from Ray...but this Easter I will get it !!!!    The game is<br/>
afoot...someone has said before ! <g>)<br/>
<br/>
There are other comments about Ray and I in challenge mode on the moor if<br/>
you read other parts of his site...He has a whole ream of nice pictures<br/>
too...<br/>
<br/>
Now I'd love to see your site grow with more pictures of other boxing<br/>
finds !!!<br/>
<br/>
A lovely discovery....thank you !<br/>

Thanks to you for the kind words about my new baby site--it is very<br/>
encouraging to hear your kind words.  I've added some more to it already,<br/>
and hope to be able to do more of that a little at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also for the stories and information about your letterboxing friends<br/>
and adventures.  I can't get too much of that!<br/>
