Just wanted to say what fun we had playing Disc Golf at Ninigret Park in Charlestown, RI last night.  All the time we've lived here in the area we never stopped to play it until a letterbox ("Perfect Summer Day" by The Kurdziel Family) was placed on the golf course.  This one should be great fun for folks at the nearby (hardly a mile away) Fall Gathering as well.<br/>
<br/>
We also enjoyed the Tolland 4-H Fair this weekend.  Thanks to Carol Stearn's efforts there were a dozen stamps to be sought there.  When added to our efforts earlier in the day throughout Tolland and in Mansfield Depot, they gave us a new personal daily record.  You can see from the logbook entries how our F count zoomed up!<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to everybody for all the fun!<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete<br/>
