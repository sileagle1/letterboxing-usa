</b><p>STATE PARK CLUES:</p>
<p>This park is located just beyond the southernmost extension of the glaciers 
that once covered the state. Formed at the bottom of a shallow sea 250 million 
years ago, regional uplifts and gradual erosion gave rise to the winding ridges 
and deep ravines characteristic of this land now covered by hardwood forest.</p>
<p>Encompassing 15,696 acres, this is the largest State Park in Indiana. It was 
established in 1929.  The Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the 
roads, buildings, two log lookout towers and two lakes. There is a saddle barn, 
70 miles of bridle trails, and a horseman’s camp. For the hiker, there are 
over 12 miles of trails. This park has a nature center with a snake exhibit and 
bird watching room. The wildlife that inhabits this park are adapted to life in 
the forest and forest edges…white-tailed deer, raccoon, gray squirrel and 
birds such as white-breasted nuthatch, cardinal, junco, pileated woodpecker, and 
wild turkey. At the north entrance to the park is the Ramp Bridge over Salt 
Creek. Built in 1838 and moved to the park in 1932, it is the only two-lane 
covered bridge constructed with Burr arch trusses in Indiana.</p><b>
</b><p>LETTERBOX CLUES:</p>
<p>Start your search at Trailhead # 6 that circles the smaller of the two lakes. 
Ascend the stairs off to the right of the earthen dam. Much of this path is 
composed of wooden boardwalks and several staircases that lead down to the 
water. You will come to a section of boardwalk that is built around two trees. 
Keep on walking. You will cross a wooden bridge and climb another set of stairs 
further along the path. Up ahead you will come to a stone bridge. From the 
middle of it walk about 40 paces (1 pace is about 3 feet). You should be at a 
large flat boulder that lies directly on the trail. Step over the boulder and 
walk another 10 paces. There is an oak tree on your right with a large flat slab 
of sandstone that juts horizontally out of the ground at its base. The letterbox 
lies in a protected hollow underneath the slab hidden by some small 
stones.  This is a busy trail; please be discreet when stamping up and 
re-hiding this letterbox.</p>
