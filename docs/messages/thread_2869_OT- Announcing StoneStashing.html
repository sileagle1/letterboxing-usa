                    <div class="plaintext-content">For several months I have been thinking about and working on <br/>
developing a variant of the treasure hunt game that I refer to as <br/>
StoneStashing. It is certainly based in my love of letterboxing, but <br/>
quite different in some ways. Recently with  great input from some <br/>
others I have finally begun to develop a website devoted to the idea. <br/>
The  very first Stone Stash has been placed in combo with my <br/>
Canaveral Marsh Letterbox. It has already been found for the first <br/>
time by Sandi from Kissimmee. I expect another visitor to it very <br/>
soon.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in finding out more about StoneStashing you <br/>
can check out the website http://www.stonestashing.com . Right now <br/>
there is only a little basic info and some discussion forums where <br/>
interested folks will meet to talk about the hobby. Much more to come <br/>
in the near future.  If you want to participate in the discussions <br/>
just go to the forums page and register so you will be able to post. <br/>
As this is a little off topic for this list please either contact me <br/>
directly with questions, or better yet post them to the forums on the <br/>
site. Thanks.<br/>

Thanks much for the interest. Just as an idea for you and others, I <br/>
have been using stones that I cut into small slabs about the same <br/>
size as rubber stamps. I thought about actually putting them in <br/>
letterboxes (with combo letterbox/stonestashes) with the stamp but <br/>
thought it would confuse people and they would try to use it as a <br/>
stamp. Obviously anyone could use whatever size stone (or letterbox <br/>
stamp for that matter) they wish but I have tried to make them small <br/>
enough for typical logbooks. Please log onto the forums on the site <br/>
if you are interested continuing to talk about it and in possibly <br/>
participating. Thanks again.<br/>
