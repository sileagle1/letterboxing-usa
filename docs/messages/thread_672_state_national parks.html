                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello, everyone:<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to set up what seems to be Alabama's first letterboxing course,<br/>
since no one around here thinks I've gone mad whenever I mention it.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was wondering if anyone else has had any trouble with getting<br/>
permission from state or national parks to let you set up a course?  I've<br/>
been told that there is apparently a problem with insurance;  they don't<br/>
want private people setting things up like that.  Apparently, if I were a<br/>
company or even a non-profit, I could do a temporary one...  I tried telling<br/>
them it would likely bring in tourists, generate money and interest in the<br/>
park, be an excellent educational opportunity, etc., but no dice.<br/>
<br/>
It's enough to make me want to be shifty and just hope they don't find and<br/>
remove the boxes...<br/>
<br/>
In any case, what should/could I say to them?  Is there any hope of changing<br/>
their minds?  What approaches have worked in the past to sell officials on<br/>
this idea?<br/>

<br/>
uhh.... well..... I don't usually say anything.  I am responsible enough<br/>
to place my letterboxes in places that are not going to cause damage to<br/>
the environment.  The impact of the 4 people who visited Rock Creek #4<br/>
was quite a bit less than the teens who brought a 6 pack of their<br/>
favorite beverage and proceeded to carve up the only picnic table in the<br/>
area.<br/>

about injuries or things like that for other people<br/>

You could try to tell them that they would not have to<br/>
worry about liability.  There would be a few people to<br/>
watch over the boxes and make sure nothing bad<br/>
happens.  I have no idea.  Good Luck though.  die xo<br/>

Not intended as a slight agianst the Forest Service, or any other<br/>
entity.. but as an indicator of how certain bureaucratic persons can<br/>
impinge on others' fun... let me share my recent experience with y'all.<br/>
<br/>
For the past 3 years I have helped organize an event that caters to a<br/>
certain type of vehicle (okay... it's a Ford Bronco.. I admit it).  This<br/>
is a family event and it has been a LOT of fun to participate in the<br/>
planning.  Every year we have put on the event, we have asked about<br/>
permits from the local entity that controls the area we use.  Every year<br/>
they have denied us even the option of applying for a permit. <br/>
Fortunately, the area we use is so large and our numbers have been so<br/>
small that we have gone unnoticed.  This year we attracted over 200<br/>
trucks and about 500 participants in the event.  Needless to say.. they<br/>
noticed.  I had a phone call from the Ranger station threatening legal<br/>
action before I had even left home (now don't you wish you had attended<br/>
Bonnie?)!!  After the second phone call, which by this time had moved to<br/>
higher offices in the eschelon, we came to an understanding... no, we<br/>
didn't have a permit, but HAD attmepted to get one and had received<br/>
outright MISinformation from the person in charge.  They ended up<br/>
granting us permission to continue our event (with strong hints that we<br/>
might be prosecuted if things turned sour).<br/>
<br/>
After the event, the Chamber of Commerce for the area's small businesses<br/>
called to thank us... we had extended their busy season one more<br/>
weekend, the Search and Rescue were pleased to report that their calls<br/>
to the area were in no way connected to our group, and we found out that<br/>
the local Ranger went home and brought his family back to participate in<br/>
our activities.<br/>
<br/>
We have already begun to apply for a permit for next year.  Now that<br/>
they know us, they don't fear us.<br/>
<br/>
Place your boxes....  if the local gendarms happen to stumble across<br/>
one, I'm sure you will see similar results.<br/>

Thanks for the confidence!  I think I will just take my happy self up onto the<br/>
mountain and plant some boxes.  I can check periodically to make sure they<br/>
haven't been removed by the authorities, and if they have, I can replace them.<br/>
:)  Stamps aren't exactly free, but they aren't really expensive, either.<br/>
<br/>
We'll form a committee of the people who pay the taxes for the upkeep on the<br/>
durned thing, and decide as a group that I should place some boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Even benighted Alabamians deserve to letterbox.  :)  I suddenly feel like an<br/>
anarchist...   :P<br/>

Oh, and Bonnie, I'm Green Party;  can I still play reindeer games?  :)  My<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with Thom and Bonnie - I believe in these simple maxims:<br/>
<br/>
1) Place a box in an area traditionally frequented by hikers,<br/>
swimmers,picnicers,  etc, where a long history of hanging out or passing<br/>
through exists - whether state or federal park, or private ownership.<br/>
<br/>
2) Place the box where it cannot  (or highly unlikely) be found<br/>
accidentally by a non-letterboxer. Of course, hider and seeker must keep<br/>
in mind others in the area that might see your actions and get curious.<br/>
<br/>
3) Hide the box and write your clue in such a manner that no destruction<br/>
can occur as a result of the hunt.<br/>
<br/>
4) Finally, always refer to the liability statement on the LBNA web page<br/>
and clues.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With regard to this last comment - Di or anyone else with relavent<br/>
experience: does this liability statement do what we intend. It was<br/>
written by non-lawyers, so I'd like to hear any comments that you might<br/>
have.<br/>

For what it's worth, I though I'd throw my comments into the discussion of <br/>
letterboxes in state/national parks.  I haven't actually placed a box in a <br/>
National Park, but a number of mine are in State Parks and National Forests.  <br/>
I agree with the sentiment that it's best just to do it, and not ask for <br/>
permission.<br/>
<br/>
The authorities are not taking any risk by having letterboxes on the land <br/>
they oversee.  However, if they give their absolute APPROVAL to our actions, <br/>
and then we go out and place boxes in dangerous places, I can see where they <br/>
could be perceived as being somewhat responsible.  As long as they have not <br/>
been consulted, they could not possibly be liable for any irresponsible acts. <br/>
 Of course, since all true letterboxers are responsible, <br/>
environmentally-conscious individuals, so this is not really an issue... <br/>
RIGHT???  I do recommend including a waiver in your clues, however.  Anyone <br/>
who gets clues from our website, for example, will have been exposed to the <br/>
LbNA Waiver of Responsibility, so what they do after that is their own <br/>
business, not yours or mine.<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of stirring up controversy, let me say that I'm not entirely <br/>
comfortable with the idea of placing boxes that do not contain any contact <br/>
information for the person who placed it.  Being an anonymous letterboxer <br/>
might be best for YOU, but it is not necessarily good for the hobby, as a <br/>
whole.<br/>
<br/>
If a box is discovered with contact information, I feel the authorities will <br/>
be more accepting of it.  At worst, they might contact the person who placed <br/>
it and ask them to remove it.  If a box is discovered that has no contact <br/>
information in it, though, I think they are much more likely to regard it as <br/>
littering.  They won't have anyone to pin the charge on, but it will reflect <br/>
badly on the hobby, in general.  Then, we can expect to find new laws being <br/>
written that specifically forbid letterboxing in such areas.<br/>
<br/>
As it is, federal and state regulations itemize many actions that are <br/>
forbidden.  These regulations are published in leaflets that you can pick up <br/>
at most ranger stations and are often posted on signs.  I have yet to see a <br/>
regulation that specifically lists letterboxing as a no-no.  Some parks <br/>
specifically forbid digging, so 'plugging' boxes under a chunk of sod might <br/>
be out of the question.  But I think it is a far cry to declare that a <br/>
well-hidden letterbox that contains contact information in case of problems <br/>
would qualify as littering.  In my opinion, letterboxing is a legal activity <br/>
in most parks, though I do not expect the authorities to make any official <br/>
announcements to that affect any time soon.  As soon as they do something <br/>
like that, they will be opening the door to any irresponsible jerk that comes <br/>
along.  (No sir, mister Ranger, sir...  that's not an abandoned six-pack... <br/>
it's just six empty letterboxes that aren't hidden very well.)<br/>
