We have "No Skin Off My Back" and "Witch Hazel" at the moment <br/>
(10/17/04) If anyone has one of the other HH's from this series and <br/>
wants to trade, please email me at Bindlestiff underscore boxer at <br/>
yahoo dot com.<br/>
<br/>
If I don't get a reply in 2 or 3 days, I'll be placing these HH's in <br/>
some other letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; The Haunted HH Series is a series of 10 Halloween-themed HH that I <br/>
have planted and/or sent to other parts of the country to be planted <br/>
in boxes there.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The log book of each HH contains a URL specific to that HH.  Each <br/>
URL provides a clue.  Together all 10 clues will lead you to the <br/>
Haunted House Letterbox, which is an unposted permanently planted <br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I do ask that the URL's specific to each Haunted HH not be posted <br/>
to any public forum.  Also, feel free to trade HH with other boxes <br/>
if they have one you are looking for.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Posting your HH finds to the letterbox travellers talklist will <br/>
help people to know where these little goblins have recently been <br/>
spotted.<br/>
