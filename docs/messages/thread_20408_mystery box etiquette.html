If so, I never saw your post, though I don't read many posts from MA (I live <br/>
in CT).  If you are talking about the Windmill Letterbox, it's most likely <br/>
missing.<br/>

someone, I keep in mind it may have been a few years since the <br/>
person placed the box, and since that time they may have lost <br/>
interest in the hobby, or for whatever reason arent monitoring that <br/>
particular email address, or arent involved whatsoever. I really <br/>
wouldnt take it personally, I dont see how you could have leaked any <br/>
info using the lbna site to send an email. Good luck in your <br/>

We too were unable to locate the box.  I believe one of the landmarks in <br/>
the clue may be missing.  Haven't yet e-mailed the placer, but hopefully <br/>
we'll get word sooner or later.<br/>
