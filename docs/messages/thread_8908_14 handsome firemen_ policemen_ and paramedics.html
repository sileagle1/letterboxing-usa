&gt;      I went alone to get a box that was newly planted in Howard <br/>
&gt; County, MD. I figured it to be a quick find and not a difficult <br/>
walk. <br/>
&gt; I looked all over for the box and time was running short. I came to <br/>
&gt; the conclusion the box was missing or I was in the wrong spot. I <br/>
&gt; could see my car across the empty lake and decided to take this <br/>
short <br/>
&gt; cut. Earlier there had been many people and dogs down in the area <br/>
&gt; that I planned to walk through. So across I went. Mucky started to <br/>
&gt; get muckier. When I tried to turn around to go back my right foot <br/>
&gt; sunk deep - thigh deep! I tried to dig it out but then my left foot <br/>
&gt; went just as far. I didn't have a cell phone with me, but I blew my <br/>
&gt; whistle forever. I started thinking about Rose in the movie <br/>
Titanic, <br/>
&gt; blowing her whistle. Although I wasn't in ice water, the mucky mud <br/>
&gt; was very cold and stinky. The more I moved the deeper I got. <br/>
Finally <br/>
&gt; someone called from shore and said he had called 911 and they were <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; their way. <br/>
&gt;    Fire engines, police cars, ambulances, appeared all at once. All <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; could think of was "Please Dear God don't have me on the 6 o'clock <br/>
&gt; news."  These wonderful men said I wasn't their first "stuck in the <br/>
&gt; mud" that day. It's happening all over the county. So what looks <br/>
safe <br/>
&gt; isn't.   <br/>
&gt;   I was stuck for an hour, So much for short cuts! Never again, <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; was just about the most frightening experience I ever had. And <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; that letterbox - I'll just forget about it! <br/>
