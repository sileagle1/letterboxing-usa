                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I know everyone else knows this but I will show my ignorance: <br/>
how does one calculate a PFX? It must be adding those three numbers <br/>
and not multiplying them, right? Or does one weight the numbers in <br/>
some other formula? Maybe it is a diffent thing entirely. <br/>
<br/>
So, could anyone enlighten this old badger?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I was up in Eureka / Fortuna area this week and found the <br/>
Fairyland box. It was in very good shape. Might I comment, echoing <br/>
those others who wrote in it, that the instructions might tell one to <br/>
turn around at the Immortal Tree and COME BACK 0.2 mi. instead of <br/>
continuing past it? That way is a Walter Haas grove. I finally found <br/>
a kindly soul in the gift shop who dug out a 1982 map to find the <br/>
Abraham Haas grove was back the other way. <br/>
<br/>
The woods there are wonderful. Just like the Forest Moon of Endor <br/>
outta Star Wars. Ewoks everywhere. Someone has placed a small charm <br/>
in the box echoing the stamp. I left it in there, of course.<br/>
