<br/>
After telling my co-workers about letterboxing one went out to try<br/>
letterboxing.  They went to look for the Resolution letterbox, they could<br/>
not find the box.  Does anyone know if the box is missing ?  or did they<br/>
just miss the box ?    They still had a good time and they want to try<br/>
another letterbox this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

The last time I was at Rocky Neck, I was walking near there so I <br/>
checked to see if Resolution was still there, and it was. I don't <br/>
remember exactly when that was, probably a couple of months ago ... <br/>
but my guess would be that it is probably still there.  (It is a <br/>
Drewclan box.)<br/>
