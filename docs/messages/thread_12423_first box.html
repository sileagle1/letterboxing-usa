i have planted my first letterbox today...it is not official yet tho....it is one by a reststop....<br/>
<br/>
today i went to plant it....there is a gold course across from it...and a small field area between the rest stop and golf course...well the rest stop was busy....probably could pull it off...but as i got closer to the field i saw the maintenance guys sitting on the lawn mowers for the golf course...oh oh...are they going to do the field area??...we waited...they sat and talked....we left...went back a few hours later...did not see the maintenance guys....so i went ahead and got everyting out and counted the paces etc.....went and planted it where i wanted....went back to the rest stop...sitting on the bench...we busted oout laughing...here comes not one BUT TWO mowers down the street...they turned down the street farther down...hopefully they dont mow the field area where i planted it...im pretty sure its not golf course property...anywhooooooo....so now i have to wait till my friend comes back from her trip and have her follow my drections and see if she can find it...then i will know if its still there...<br/>
<br/>
FIGURES!!!!!...my first plant and it has probably been mowed down, and not even a day old yet.....<br/>
<br/>
so will post directions/clues later if all is good later....<br/>
