Clues<br/>
I have replanted Johnny Fox and added the Brass Dragon<br/>
<br/>
These are temporary microboxes for the duration of the Maryland <br/>
Renaissance Fair season. Check local listings, or Google their <br/>
website, for opening hours and fees.<br/>
<br/>
Johnny Fox,<br/>
<br/>
sword swallower extraordinaire, has been entertaining at the MD Ren <br/>
Fest for over 20 years. The first time I saw his show I was so <br/>
shocked, I laughed so hard I cried and I hurt. "Water from India," <br/>
protects him from harm. I'll let you figure out whether he really <br/>
swallows the swords or not. <br/>
<br/>
After the show buy some snacks from Johnny Fox's Almonds booth. Then <br/>
turn left past the School of Juggling and find an interesting triple <br/>
tree with a trunk smaller than the other two. Behind it is a zig zag <br/>
path going down the hill. Halfway down find a long curved bench. <br/>
Count 4 support posts from right to left and sit down next to the <br/>
4th one. Reach under the bench and between the supports for what you <br/>
seek.<br/>
<br/>
Brass Dragon<br/>
<br/>
Stroll up Kenwood Lane. Note the "King of Swords" shop. He is my <br/>
family's armorer. We have five of his fine wooden shords and knives. <br/>
Every year he repaints them for us. <br/>
<br/>
Find the Brass Dragon. Be sure to look carefully as you will <br/>
recognize one of them later. Count the number of dragons above the <br/>
rain gutter. Multiply that number by 60 and head off in that <br/>
direction. Stop at the stage sign.<br/>
