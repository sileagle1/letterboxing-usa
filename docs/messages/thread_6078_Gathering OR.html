With the good weather upon us, it seems like a great time to have a <br/>
Letterboxing Rendezvous. Tom<br/>
Cheney and I figure that Balch Creek/Macleay Park are in dire need of <br/>
letterboxes. Let's get together and<br/>
stash some boxes, put stamp images with faces, have a picnic and romp in the <br/>
woods. We couldn't decide<br/>
on a firm date and figured we'd do the democratic thing and take a poll. The <br/>
choices are 8/4, 8/10 or 8/<br/>

<br/>
This sounds great.  8/4 is OUT for me, but the other two dates should be<br/>
O.K., I think.  Have to check with John, though.   Also...I have another<br/>
letterbox just waiting to be placed and I was wanting to place it on the<br/>
trail just West of the first Cornell Tunnel, which is kind of in the<br/>
area you're talking about, so I'll be hiding it pretty soon.  I also<br/>
have some other ideas for letterboxes and I can probably place some out<br/>
there.  This is a great opportunity.  THANKS!  This will be SO MUCH FUN!<br/>
<br/>

You certainly wouldn't be crashing the party.  You will be a most<br/>
