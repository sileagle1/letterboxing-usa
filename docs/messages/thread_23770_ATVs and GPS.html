&gt; I was wondering about how much impact that ATV's have had in your <br/>
&gt; area... I personlly would like to see them banned.<br/>
<br/>
Well, Out West (or in our small part of it, i.e. Southern California),<br/>
ATV use is rampant, but it is also highly controlled, in many areas. <br/>
There are a number of places, in the mountains and in the Mojave<br/>
Desert, where off-highway vehicles (OHV is the term used out here) can<br/>
run to their heart's content, with very few restrictions other than<br/>
safety ones.  Some of these areas are huge, but they are mostly<br/>
out-of-the-way, and in places that have been deemed free of endangered<br/>
species, etc.  There are also areas where OHVs can run on established<br/>
roads and trails only, and going off them is frowned-upon.  Finally,<br/>
there are areas where OHVs are prohibited, and violating that can be<br/>
very expensive, with fines up to and including confiscation of the<br/>
vehicle, plus monetary fines and even jail time.  The vast majority of<br/>
riders have reconciled themselves to the reality out here: they ride<br/>
where they are allowed to, and generally stay out of where they<br/>
shouldn't be.  We don't own an OHV, but have thought about a Jeep-type<br/>
vehicle for our rockhounding, so are at least a little sympathetic to<br/>
those who do enjoy roaring around on them.  As long as they stay<br/>
inside the areas set aside for them, we're quite happy that they *do*<br/>
have such areas.  We can't complain about their form of recreation, as<br/>
long as they respect ours :-)  Naturally, these OHV areas are *not*<br/>
the best places for letterboxes, geocaches and other such things, and<br/>
the few that show up in them are generally designed with the OHV-user<br/>
in mind.  The advantage that California, Nevada, etc. have over New<br/>
York, New Jersey and much of the rest of the Eastern Seaboard is<br/>
space: we still have a lot of it, although what isn't set aside for<br/>
recreation is being gobbled up for homes and such at an alarming rate.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ...How do you feel about using GPS coordinates in addition to the <br/>
&gt; regular clues?<br/>
<br/>
I might respond there as well, but I'm going to take advantage of this<br/>
question here.  <br/>
<br/>
My short answer would be "Bring 'em on!!" :-)  We've stated more than<br/>
once that we are very active geocachers, so we are very conversant<br/>
with GPSr use.  We've given some thought to how we might hide an LB<br/>
that used both "standard cluing" as well as GPSr, and someday we hope<br/>
to be able to figure out a good way to do it.  If anyone wanted to<br/>
hide an LB that uses GPS coords as part of the clues, we think it<br/>
would be fun.  The only thing that would *not* be good, IOHO, is to<br/>
have the final hiding spot be given with coords: that's a geocache, no<br/>
matter how else you disguise it.  Geocaching already has hybrid boxes,<br/>
so letterboxing ought to be able to, as well.<br/>
<br/>
On a related issue, I have to say that anyone (and please don't take<br/>
this as a personal attack; I'm concerned for individual safety,<br/>
nothing else) who rejects carrying a GPSr out-of-hand, is foolish, or<br/>
at least a bit foolhardy.  OK, if you only hike on trails you've<br/>
already been on, and/or you never hike more than a tenth-of-a-mile<br/>
from your car, maybe you can get along without one.  But anyone who<br/>
(like us) does a lot of hiking on trails we don't know (that's one of<br/>
the points of both geocaching and letterboxing, isn't it?), as well as<br/>
long hikes on trails we do know, really ought to have both a GPSr<br/>
along, as well as a means of emergency communication, and I don't mean<br/>
just a cell phone.  Cell phones are notorious for not working in the<br/>
very areas where they are most-useful, at least out here.  At the<br/>
least, carrying an FRS radio is a good idea.  These are usually sold<br/>
in pairs.  Sharon and I use an agreed-upon frequency, so even if one<br/>
of us is on his/her own, the other can make an attempt to communicate.<br/>
 Single hikers can leave the other radio with a friend.  Naturally,<br/>
anyone hiking alone should leave a note with someone as to where they<br/>
are going, when they expect to be back, etc. etc. etc.  FRS is limited<br/>
in range, but it's better than nothing, and it works in areas where<br/>
cell phones don't.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line: emergency radios, compass, good map and a GPSr with a<br/>
mapping function (they all have that, now) are all good things to have<br/>
along on any hike, even a short one.  It's not being a geek or a nerd<br/>
to be prepared.  It comes down to "Better Safe than Sorry." <br/>
Rattlesnakes, mountain lions, bears and people-with-bad-intentions<br/>
don't care if you are just out for a short jaunt.<br/>
