I see where that finger is pointing...  but up there in the U.P. where we were caught in the freak blizzard of white stuff (snow, not PZKut), there are not even any airports...  We're talking remote, hicksville, back country...  just got electricity.  Besides, OldShoe is so bad at reading a map that had I left him en route to make a short PZKut run, he'd never have found his way back to pick me up.  I'd still be wandering around with suitcases full of PZKut.<br/>

Nope, I'm thinking that there may be holes in this Japan alibi that Team Green Dragon has provided.  Sure the game sounds awesome, but I think that is just a diversion, to get us all so geeked out about the game that we forget the real matter at hand...<br/>
