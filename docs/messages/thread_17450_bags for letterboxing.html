couldn't wrap my mind around how it would work out<br/>

overnight alone, but sometimes one or the other of us<br/>
will pack alone with one of the kids, so the<br/>
distribution of weight and mass becomes pretty<br/>
critical.  When we pack alone with a kid, it is<br/>
usually in pretty moderate weather, so we could cut<br/>
our overnight gear down quite a bit.  Just<br/>
wondering...there are a number of other things we<br/>
might need more than this, but if it would work for<br/>
overnighting, it would move wayyyy up the priority<br/>
list!<br/>

Everyone I know that goes backpacking on a regular basis uses some <br/>
sort of water hydration system--typically a Camelback or Platypus.  <br/>
It's nearly impossible to drink enough water otherwise.  Hiking on <br/>
rugged terrain with a heavy pack, you NEED to drink a lot of water <br/>
to avoid dehydration--for more so than for day hikes--and pulling <br/>
out a water bottle every few minutes isn't very practical.  Whether <br/>
you use a Cambelback or Platypus is a personal preference, but it's <br/>
one piece of equipment I'd recommend for any backpacker.<br/>
<br/>
There's a poor man's version I saw while hiking the AT that I'd <br/>
probably try had I not already bought everything already.  The guy <br/>
bought the bite valve and hose that comes out of it of a Platypus, <br/>
but for the waterbag he used an empty two-liter bottle of soda.  It <br/>
seems the threads fit perfectly and it worked well for him.  The <br/>
bottle needs to be stored upsidedown while in use since it doesn't <br/>
have the flexible walls of a normal Platypus bag, but it did work.  <br/>
And if the water bag starts to get grimey or something, throw it <br/>
away and buy a new one.  A pretty clever set up.  =)<br/>

When I bowhunt elk in late August I use a 100 oz. camelback and <br/>
carry a 1 quart GI canteen. That's my standard water load for any <br/>
warm wheather day hike. If I'm planning an overnight hike I also <br/>
carry a 2 quart GI canteen with a hose &amp; bite valve. I like the army <br/>
surplus gear, it's inexpensive, easy to find &amp; never breaks or wears <br/>
out. The 2 quart canteen is somewhat flexible &amp; the hose fits all <br/>
the way in to the bottom. I always feel you can't carry too much <br/>
water, the extra wieght is self correcting. The only problem with <br/>
the soda bottle is that they are not very rugged, when mine came <br/>
apart in my pack, soaking me &amp; everything in the pack, I went with <br/>
the GI stuff.<br/>
