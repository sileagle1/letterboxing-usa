                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is a big state, and separate Southern and Northern California <br/>
gatherings make a lot of sense, but I like Jugglermouse's idea.  The <br/>
Central Coast is one of the biggest letterboxing areas in <br/>
California.  I vote for the city of San Luis Obispo for the gathering <br/>
(by coincidence, Juggler's town).  There are 20 letterboxes planted <br/>
in the city, and another 50 of them in nearby towns.  San Luis Obispo <br/>
is also located almost exactly halfway between Los Angeles (my town) <br/>
and San Francisco, so I think it makes the perfect choice.<br/>

  Okay, like Ms. Mouse, I am prejudiced. The San Luis Obispo area has a <br/>
  large concentration of boxes with more going in everyday. We have <br/>
  high climbing ones; we have drive-by ones. We have stop in the shop <br/>
