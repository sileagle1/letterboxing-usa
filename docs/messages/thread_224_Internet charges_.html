<br/>
I sent out an email a little while ago titled, "Charges for internet<br/>
use".<br/>
I felt it was right, since we have staunchly defended free access for<br/>
clues,<br/>
to be informed on any charges in general which might be imposed on us.<br/>
<br/>
But...<br/>
<br/>
I decided after sending the note to check the validity of it.  Does<br/>
anyone<br/>
know anything about this?  Is there such a bill on long distance charges<br/>
<br/>
for internet access or is this a hoax?<br/>
<br/>
I could not find anything on it at<br/>
http://www.house.gov/<br/>
<br/>
But then maybe the bill has already left the house.  That, or I have<br/>
been<br/>
bamboozled...<br/>
If anyone knows anything about this please comment.  If I have sent out<br/>
the<br/>
note in error please excuse me.  Next time I will check such things out<br/>
in<br/>
advance of notifying you.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Dan<br/>

I received a similar e-mail at wortk a week or 2 ago,  forwarded it<br/>
home, and followed up - I ouild not find any such bill, or even a form<br/>
to fill out. I just assumed that the link I received was incorrect,<br/>
i.e., that I got  to the wrong place, so  I never followed it up<br/>
further.<br/>

Its one less thing.  I'm happy that the medium is sort of like roads<br/>
&amp; bridges without tolls.  Its such a pain to have to stop every 10<br/>
miles to pay, you know?<br/>

  Well, it's not exactly a hoax, but it evidently isn't true either.<br/>
  At one time (1987) there was such a issue before the FCC, but<br/>
  nothing came of it....<br/>
