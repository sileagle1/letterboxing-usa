Coming from the west on Rt.44 take a left onto 169 at Pomfret Center.<br/>
Coming from the east on Rt.101 take a right onto 169. Travel up 169<br/>
North .3 of a mile. When you see the sanctuary signs on the right you<br/>
can park here on the grass. From the parking area, follow the trail<br/>
going south. You will walk through an overgrown field and come to a bend<br/>
in the trail when you get to the Wappoquia Brook.Keep following the<br/>
trail on the edge of the brook. Notice the unusual tree house in the<br/>
tree across the brook. You will soon come to wooden planks that cross<br/>
over a low area, then alittle further down you will cross over a bridge<br/>
that goes over the brook. The bridge is alittle crooked but sturdy.<br/>
Walking through thorne bushes on each side you will come to a steep<br/>
embankment. At the top you will see a big field of clover, and a T in<br/>
the trail. Go left here. Walk along the wood line. Soon you'll be back<br/>
into the woods. Pass through a stone wall , get to the top of the hill<br/>
to another T in the trail.Go left here also.Go down the hill and the<br/>
trail will bend back towards the brook. Shortly after you will come to a<br/>
big evergreen on the right side of the trail that splits into two<br/>
sisters. Behind this evergreen, up the hill there is a small pile of<br/>
brush with a good size tree behind it. Your box will be at the base of<br/>
the tree covered with sticks and leaves.Please rehide well.  Contiue on<br/>
the trail a very short distance. There will be a trail that bares off to<br/>
the right and goes up a steep hill, take this right. At the top of the<br/>
hill it comes out to another clover field. Go right and follow the field<br/>
on the edge of the woodline. There will soon be a trail on the right,<br/>
that goes back into the woods you will come to a Y take a left back<br/>
through the same stone wall you came through back to the first clover<br/>
field. Stay to the right of the field on the woodline, soon you will<br/>
come to the trail on your right that goes back down the hill. Follow<br/>
trail all the way back to your car.<br/>
