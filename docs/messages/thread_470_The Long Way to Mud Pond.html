                    <div class="plaintext-content">Randy used the phrase "long way to Mud Pond" a week or so ago, and in <br/>
another post to me verified that all the Braintree boxes were in <br/>
place and intact after the winter.<br/>
<br/>
His way was long indeed, as he had to drive over 300 miles to a <br/>
very obscure little town in Central Vermont, and then follow <br/>
lots of little twisting dirt roads up into the hills. Randy, however, <br/>
found all four boxes in one day, which I found pretty impressive.<br/>
<br/>
Randy, I think your personal stamp is great - particularly <br/>
appropriate this time of year, when all the painted trilliums are <br/>
coming out.<br/>
<br/>
I confirmed the Mud Pond box for myself a week later, on the <br/>
anniversary of my introduction to letterboxing. A year ago I was just <br/>
finishing up an orienteering mini-course with four students, and <br/>
another teacher handed me a copy of the Smithsonian magazine, <br/>
wondering if I might be interested in this quaint <br/>
orienteering-related hobby.<br/>
<br/>
I have been running the course again this spring, combining <br/>
orienteering and letterboxing. My four students and I set a two-leg <br/>
course up the side of Braintree Hill, bushwhacked for two hours, and <br/>
came out right at our goal - the Rolling Rock Road. We set off down <br/>
to Mud Pond, where we had lunched, and then they proceeded to find <br/>
the box - the last of the four for them. A very pleasant day and a <br/>
fitting way to celebrate the anniversary.<br/>
