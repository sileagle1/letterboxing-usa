The Red Rock Canyon LB is Amanda's. Hopefully she will catch this post. Ryan has two boxes near Boulder City, Ariz. ( close to Las Vegas) and we have one just into Ariz. near Mesquite, Nev. about 1 hr north of Las Vegas. Don<br/>

  Hello,<br/>
     We are planning a trip to Las Vegas in a few weeks.  I thought there were <br/>
  letterboxes at Red Rock Canyon but they are not on the new web site.  If <br/>
  anyone has any information I would greatly appreciate it.  Also if there are any <br/>
  other good boxes to do please let me know.  I've checked the ones on line and am <br/>
  currently trying to figure out some of the mystery ones.  Thanks for the <br/>
  help.<br/>
<br/>
  Christi<br/>
