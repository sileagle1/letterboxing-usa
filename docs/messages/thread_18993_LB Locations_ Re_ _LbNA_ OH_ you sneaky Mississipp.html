Don't let your carving abilities keep you from planting boxes!  I'll bet your <br/>
skills are much better than you imagine, since we're always our own worst <br/>
critic.  <br/>
<br/>
Having just returned from a vacation where I included letterboxing in my <br/>
sightseeing activities, it was wonderful to appreciate the beautiful scenery and <br/>
unusual sights where boxes were planted.  I think location is a critical factor <br/>
in box placement.  Even if I can't find the box (which did happen a few times <br/>
this trip), I'm still grateful that my search took me to areas where I may <br/>
never have ventured before.  It allowed me the opportunity to see sights that <br/>
were off the beaten path that otherwise I may never have known existed.  This <br/>
has happened with boxes in my own state and own area, as well.  Sometimes it's <br/>
the out-of-the-way little local parks that have interesting history and unusual <br/>
monuments that highlight intriguing local lore.<br/>
<br/>
Last fall, some LB friends and I planted a series of boxes in a very small, <br/>
very out-of-the-way little park in a very rural area.  We happened upon the <br/>
park and were amazed by what we saw.  We had such fun walking around, imagining <br/>
where we would plant the boxes, what the images would be, etc.  After checking <br/>
on the series this spring, it was fun to see who had been there.  Although it <br/>
hasn't yet received a lot of traffic (it was planted in late fall, and under <br/>
snow all winter), those who have been there and contacted us have enjoyed the <br/>
sights just as much as we did when we first walked around the area.<br/>
<br/>
Keep on planting!<br/>
Take care,<br/>
StampinPam (who thanks all of those who planted boxes for me to enjoy on my <br/>
trip to TN and NC)<br/>

&gt; DH and I took the dog out for a date this afternoon, to plant 2 new <br/>
&gt; boxes and check on 3 in the Hattiesburg area. It's been 3-4 months <br/>
&gt; since I planted the boxes, and I fully expected to find not a thing <br/>
&gt; in the logbooks. Letterboxers are kinda scarce out here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, turn me over and paint me blue, I had 5 visitors to each box!! <br/>
&gt; The SAME 5!! Most (4) hailing from the southern Mississippi area, one <br/>
&gt; from Hattiesburg itself! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So my point-GET OFF YOUR DUFFS AND PLANT ME SOME BOXES TO FIND!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here I am thinking there aren't any letterboxers for 100 miles! Trust <br/>
&gt; me, I am a much better finder than planter (carving skills, despite <br/>
&gt; much practice, remain pathetic at best!) so please,please,please, if <br/>
&gt; you are one of these letterboxers and read this list-PLANT! <br/>
