I just learned of Letterboxing yesterday, and Im very extited to get <br/>
started... I've already bugun working on designs for my signature stamp and <br/>
my first letterbox stamp (I have 3 letterboxes in mind to place in the near <br/>
future [in western washington]).<br/>
<br/>
I had a question though, when equiping a letterbox do you include an ink pad <br/>
or not?  Most guides dont mention including an ink pad, but I wanted to be <br/>
sure.<br/>
<br/>
I cant wait to get started.  My husband is supportive of the idea.... <br/>
afterall he's been trying to get me away from my PC and out on day-hikes all <br/>

Hey Mischief!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome aboard!  Ink pads in the letterbox is up to you.  Personally, I<br/>
don't include them for these reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1) would be a little expensive<br/>
<br/>
2) could leak &amp; cause damage to the other contents<br/>
<br/>
3) would eventually dry out &amp; would require maintenance<br/>
<br/>
Instead... on the off-chance that another letterboxer doesn't have a pad,<br/>
but would like an impression of my stamp, I usually stamp several pages in<br/>
the back of my log book and include box info, etc.  These can be easily torn<br/>
out as evidence of finding the box.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!<br/>

Hurrah!  I hope you are in the Seattle area.  Since most of the <br/>
Pacific Northwest boxes are concentrated in Oregon, it will be nice <br/>
to have more up this way!  <br/>
<br/>
I should get up off my butt and plant a few, (I have been working on <br/>
carving some stamps...but my art needs refining.)<br/>

My sister and I are brand new to letterboxing, and after 3 weeks of <br/>
preparation (Took 4-EVER to pick out our personal journals and decide on a <br/>
design for our personal stamps!) we are finally ready to look for our first <br/>
boxes this Saturday!  This is short notice, but we're wondering if anyone <br/>
can confirm that St. George's boxes in the Syracuse, NY area have been <br/>
placed for the season?  The clues indicate yes, but we were hoping for a <br/>
double check.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone on this list and the web site developers - we've learned <br/>
so much from the web site and reading old and new posts.  What a wonderful <br/>
group of people to learn from!<br/>

This is a wonderful group of people and like any group of people, it has a<br/>
plethora of personalities.  The degree of participation varies widely from<br/>
person to person, with some checking the list hourly to those that check it<br/>
weekly or longer.<br/>
<br/>
People come here for camaraderie, friendship, idea sharing and question<br/>
answering, along with stories and brainstorming and just about anything<br/>
people can do in a large group of like minded people.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it's a pretty kewl group of people here, most with tons of<br/>
experience and knowledge and all willing to help and explain things to the<br/>
newer folks.  Couldn't ask for a better group of people to share a hobby<br/>
with.<br/>

still don't quite understand the language along with some other things.<br/>

1. What is a hitch hicker (HH) and how does it work.<br/>
<br/>
2. What do you do with the stamps when you find the box?  Do you leave <br/>
your stamp and take theres or do you just use there stamp to stamp <br/>
your book and use your stamp to stamp there book?<br/>

I think those are my most pressing question.  Would love to start <br/>

<br/>
Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
As to the HH, it is a small traveling box that goes from box to box.  If you<br/>
find a HH, you would normally take it with you (after making sure it has<br/>
already been stamped in to the host box's logbook and the host's stamp has<br/>
been stamped into the HH's logbook, and doing so if it hasn't been done).<br/>
You would then stamp it's stamp into your logbook and your stamp into it's<br/>
logbook.  When you visit a box that the HH will fit in, you will leave it,<br/>
but not before exchanging between the new host and the HH.  If you don't<br/>
think you'll be finding it a new home quickly, you can leave a HH in the<br/>
original host and exchange stamp images with it still.  Don't keep a HH too<br/>
long though if you can help it!<br/>
<br/>
To your second question, you never exchange stamps - you exchange stamp<br/>
images!  So as you said, you would stamp the box's stamp into your book and<br/>
your stamp into the box's book, leaving behind the stamp you found in the<br/>
box and keeping the stamp you brought with you.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. What is a hitch hicker (HH) and how does it work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. What do you do with the stamps when you find the box? Do you leave<br/>
&gt; your stamp and take theres or do you just use there stamp to stamp<br/>
&gt; your book and use your stamp to stamp there book?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think those are my most pressing question. Would love to start<br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">Starting with question #2, no you definitely DO NOT<br/>
trade stamps.  The stamp you find in the letterbox<br/>
stays with the box.  Often it has been carved with a<br/>
particular place in mind, and it is the property of<br/>
the box owner.<br/>
<br/>
When you find the letterbox and open it, you take your<br/>
OWN stamp and stamp its image in the letterbox<br/>
logbook.  You can write your trail name there, too,<br/>
where you are from, the date, and often folks leave a<br/>
nice note about the hike, the well-carved stamp, etc. <br/>
Look through the logbook and you'll see how fun it is<br/>
to read the humorous notes and encouraging words from<br/>
fellow box-finders.<br/>
<br/>
Then you use the letterbox stamp and place its image<br/>
in your own journal/logbook.  Some folks like to write<br/>
their own notes there, too.  I do, but I do it later<br/>
at home where  it's comfortable and dry.  I write<br/>
whose box it was, where I found it, and anything<br/>
interesting that happened along  the way.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the region of the country you're in, many<br/>
letterboxes do not provide markers or ink pads, so be<br/>
sure to bring your own with you.<br/>
<br/>
Everything you took out of the letterbox goes back<br/>
in--carefully!  Rebag everything, make sure the<br/>
ziplock bags are shut completely, make sure everything<br/>
is snug in the container, and then carefully rehide<br/>
the box under the rocks or where ever you found it. <br/>
Try  to not let any passersby watch you do this.<br/>
<br/>
Question #2.  Hitchhikers are like a second little<br/>
mini-letterbox.  If you're brand new to finding boxes,<br/>
I would suggest you LEAVE THEM THERE until you are<br/>
comfortable with the signing and stamping.<br/>
<br/>
When you're ready to deal with the hitchhikers, there<br/>
will be a little stamp and logbook in the hitchhiker<br/>
container.  You stamp your personal stamp in it and<br/>
then stamp the hh image in your own journal just like<br/>
you do with the traditional letterbox.  BUT the<br/>
letterbox's stamp image should also be stamped into<br/>
the hh journal, and  the hh's stamp image should be<br/>
stamped into the letterbox's logbook.  [Often folks<br/>
neglect this step, so check before you take it with<br/>
you.]  Then take the hh, and put it in another<br/>
letterbox soon on your travels [don't remove it if<br/>
you're not boxing for another month, for example].<br/>
When you get to the new box, you will stamp your<br/>
personal stamp in the logbook, stamp the letterbox<br/>
stamp in your journal, and then you will REPEAT this<br/>
process with the hitchhiker....stamp the hh stamp into<br/>
the new letterbox logbook, and stamp the letterbox<br/>
stamp into the hh logbook.  Yes, it's a bit confusing<br/>
at first, and a lot of back and forth stamping, so<br/>
that's why I would recommend waiting to deal with any<br/>
hhs you come across until you are familiar with the<br/>
basic process.<br/>
<br/>
This seems like a lot of words to explain something<br/>
that becomes routine...if you go at it with the<br/>
attitude that the letterbox is a precious gift to you<br/>
that someone else has taken the time and energy to<br/>
create, and treat it gently and carefully, you'll be<br/>
on the right track.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, Audrea.<br/>
