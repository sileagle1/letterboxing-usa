As an example, we were looking for a box that required a compass (which we didnt have LOL), but we are pretty good at making our own rough handwritten compass, and its worked for us (yes, we are getting one lol)...so, the reading was supposed to point to exactly where the box was, which was a tree in the middle of a parking lot surrounded by smaller trees and shrubs. We thought we saw the spot right away at the base of the center tree but when we got there, it was FILLED with apples and acrorns and nuts. We dug quite a bit and couldnt find so looked elsewhere. When I got home, I emailed them and verified that THAT was the tree and went back again. STILL cant find it and its packed evern more fully. Thinking it may still be in there but buried under the winter food storage, I emailed and explained we tried finding it but are uncomfortable really stirring up that much damage to an animals environment. I suggested they make the box temporarily unavailable<br/>
 and offered to go back in the spring and see if we can find it. <br/>
I think communication is the key :-) I always email and politely know if plantars need any maintenance..but USUALLY assume that Im the problem in the finding...unless Ive exhausted all my resources and still cant find it..<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I thought I had mentioned that when I was talking about poorly planted<br/>
boxes (or poorly re-hidden... some Planters have mentioned them going to<br/>
check on them and they were out in the open).  Maybe I didn't.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we can safely assume the box is missing because we are staring<br/>
at THE ONE and THE ONLY spot that the box can be in. <br/>
<br/>
For example: This box is under the red tree with fairies dancing around<br/>
it in So and So Park in Blah City.  Hmm.  There's ONE tree in the area,<br/>
its RED, and its got dancing fairies around it.  There's ONE city by<br/>
that name, there's ONE park by this name, and its a 10 foot by 10 foot<br/>
wide park... okay I'm exaggerating... a little :)<br/>
<br/>
Sometime I think Whitey and I have looked in the wrong spot.  So some we<br/>
end up marking as missing, and some we mark as "try again".  There's one<br/>
spot we've gone back to three times and although we're pretty sure its<br/>
gone, there's still a chance that we're just missing it (between<br/>
somewhat shoddy directions and us, who knows?).  I'm thinking of<br/>
messaging the person about it and having them confirm its status.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we can blame the placer, the last person to find it, or<br/>
ourselves.  And in the end its not a big deal... except to the poor<br/>
Placer.  Its gotta suck having to hear your box is gone and not knowing<br/>
why :-/<br/>
<br/>
But yeah.  We don't always blame the Placer.  We loves the Placers and<br/>
actually have fun with shoddy directions (which doesn't happen a lot) ^-^<br/>
<br/>
Good question, though :)<br/>
<br/>
-Xeen<br/>
who is still sad to see missing boxes due to whatever reason and still<br/>
doesn't understand why that thought is so BAD... lol<br/>

&gt; Sometimes we can safely assume the box is missing because <br/>
 &gt; we are staring at THE ONE and THE ONLY spot that the box can<br/>
 &gt; be in.<br/>
<br/>
People can "assume" whatever they want, but the "safety" of said<br/>
assumptions is logically fallacious.  Just like the existence of<br/>
God (and I have no intent to get into a religious debate), it is<br/>
not possible to prove non-existence, only existence.  Likewise<br/>
with letterboxes, obviously.<br/>
<br/>
If people want to make assumptions, and get in the planters' faces,<br/>
that's their choice, but I find it to be bad etiquette, bad karma,<br/>
and discouraging (at least in my case), from planting more.  I do<br/>
this for fun.  If it becomes unfun because whiny seekers are<br/>
getting in my face (demanding "quality checks", whining about long<br/>
hikes near dark and not finding anything but rocks, and other noise),<br/>
I'll find something else to do with my precious time (which I<br/>
suppose is for the best; hence not listing on the web sites,<br/>
to keep these people out of my life, for one reason).<br/>
<br/>
It really bothers me when someone sends an e-mail to me: "I'm not<br/>
asking for hints, but ...; or I know I was in the right place, and<br/>
your box isn't there".  Such a sender is doing nothing but<br/>
asking for hints.  Any communication is an information leak.<br/>
If this is to be simulated treasure hunting (and I think only<br/>
a handful of us play it that way), then part of simulated<br/>
treasure hunting is making the determination with the information<br/>
at hand and your own brain whether or not the box is missing.<br/>
I guess very few see this as a fun and interesting aspect of<br/>
the pastime, and would rather just click that "contact the placer"<br/>
button.  There is no "contact the placer" button in simulated<br/>
treasure hunting.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; For example: This box is under the red tree with fairies dancing <br/>
 &gt; around it in So and So Park in Blah City.  Hmm.  There's ONE tree<br/>
 &gt; in the area, its RED, and its got dancing fairies around it.<br/>
 &gt; There's ONE city by that name, there's ONE park by this name, and<br/>
 &gt; its a 10 foot by 10 foot wide park... okay I'm exaggerating... a<br/>
 &gt; little :)<br/>
<br/>
This is a perfect example.  Thanks for bringing it up.  Clever<br/>
clue writers can create this effect.  Trust me, I've seen it done<br/>
a few times.  Such clue writers need good spam filters to keep<br/>
whiners insisting the box is missing out of their inbox.<br/>
<br/>
It can be a lonely life playing the game as simulated treasure<br/>
hunting (the primary premise of which is no contact or information<br/>
leak other than the map between the hider and placer, because, duh,<br/>
the hider of the treasure _didn't want_ it found by others), but<br/>
that is the game to me, and it is what it is, and we call it<br/>
something different to attempt to avoid confusion for those who<br/>
enjoy "letterboxing" for what it has become.<br/>
<br/>
I realise part of the reason "letterboxing" is not simulated<br/>
treasure hunting is because of man's social nature and this need<br/>
for contact -- attempting to do simulated treasure hunting as a<br/>
game, and determine if it is a viable game, has a very high cost<br/>
in this regard, which the purists of that game accept.  The<br/>
preferred social model for simulated treasure hunters is<br/>
for _seekers to socialize together_, especially given that the<br/>
problems can be so difficult (and more heads are better than one,<br/>
especially if the problem takes 6 months to solve), but the<br/>
letterboxing culture in some quarters is to try to find 20 in a<br/>
day, and if not possible, hit that "contact the placer" button.<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer: I'm not "attacking" anyone, or disparaging those who<br/>
play the game differently (but am entitled to be annoyed at people<br/>
who whine at me or claim the box is missing when it is clear from<br/>
their e-mail they are not within 100 miles of the place, despite<br/>
the fact that it is the "only" place it could be).  Yes, boxes go<br/>
missing, and I realise it annoys some, but I am entitled to my<br/>
opinion that it is a healthy attitude to just see that as an<br/>
interesting part of the game, and simply request that those who<br/>
don't see it that way desist from whining at me, asking for hints,<br/>
etc.  My only goal is to show an alternate take on what the pastime<br/>
can be to some people.  Take it or leave it :)<br/>
<br/>
The closest thing in the real world that average people like me can<br/>
do is ghost town hunting, which is what I did before this.  Anyone<br/>
who is a ghost town hunter can see where my attitude comes from,<br/>
nothing more.  There is no "contact the placer" button.  The "boxes"<br/>
go missing over time.  "Clues", information, maps, terrain, etc., all<br/>
decay over time.  That's all it is, and IMHO is a much cooler game.<br/>
The longer things age, the _more interesting_ unraveling these decays<br/>
becomes.  My attitude does not come for arrogance or any other<br/>
nonsense that people have claimed.  Simply an attempt to simulate this<br/>
sort of game.  History, information theory, decay, the outdoors, etc.<br/>
<br/>

Not sure if it was the last placer but I do find it a bit disrespectful for someone to intentionally leave another boxers plant out in the open. Not sure if this is a trend, if someone didn't like that it was store bought stamp even though it's marked as such, if the person didn't like something about the box or if they read the boards and didn't like my remarks.<br/>
<br/>
But it is pretty amazing I had very little problems with that box and now suddenly I find I have to do maintenance more than normal on it since I started being on these boards. Has this ever been a problem with any one else? If someone is deliberately trying to sabbatoge my letterbox, then I am asking kindly for it to stop. There is no reason to go out and intentionally destroy someone's plant just because you may not agree with them on some chat board.<br/>

&gt; Not sure if it was the last placer but I do find it a bit disrespectful for someone to intentionally leave another boxers plant out in the open. Not sure if this is a trend, if someone didn't like that it was store bought stamp even though it's marked as such, if the person didn't like something about the box or if they read the boards and didn't like my remarks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But it is pretty amazing I had very little problems with that box and now suddenly I find I have to do maintenance more than normal on it since I started being on these boards. Has this ever been a problem with any one else? If someone is deliberately trying to sabbatoge my letterbox, then I am asking kindly for it to stop. There is no reason to go out and intentionally destroy someone's plant just because you may not agree with them on some chat board.<br/>

It is possible someone who is not a letterboxer found it. I usually try to check on it every two weeks but I when I saw it out in the open last week I rechecked again this Saturday and there it was back out in the open. It's under a bunch of rocks and would be rather difficult for an animal to pick up the rocks and place letterbox in same open spot where I found it before. I placed the box in March and had no problems with it until last week. I'm contemplating pulling the box and replanting else where.<br/>

Oh, and I take that challenging clues bit back! There was a mystery box<br/>
we worked on just for the heck of it and we're pretty sure we know where<br/>
its at.  Unfortunately its as far away from us as it can possibly be<br/>
without leaving the state.  But it was fun to look up.  It took a few<br/>
days and I learned a lot of history in the meantime.<br/>

You could experiment and use tape to hold the lid to the container (just a couple of small pieces should do). If an animal is moving the box then they would likely just dig it out and leave it in the open. If it was a human they may open the box first and thus unseal the tape (can't see why they'd dig out the box, not open it then leave it exposed especially if they are a letterboxer and not a non-boxer). <br/>

 &gt; Hi Xeen,<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; It is possible someone who is not a letterboxer found it. I usually try to check on it every two weeks but I when I saw it out in the open last week I rechecked again this Saturday and there it was back out in the open. It's under a bunch of rocks and would be rather difficult for an animal to pick up the rocks and place letterbox in same open spot where I found it before. I placed the box in March and had no problems with it until last week. I'm contemplating pulling the box and replanting else where.<br/>

<br/>
No teeth or claw marks on it. I did replace the box itself because the top of it cracked from being hidden under the rocks. I rehide the box again on Saturday and I'll be going by today to remove the box , I've already archived it. I'm going to chalk it up to a bad spot and move on. I had series I planned on putting out that did have carved stamps in them but I am debating if I should rethink what type of boxes I want them to be.  I'm now leaning toward doing mystery boxes and having any one interested email me for the first set of clues instead of putting them out on a website.<br/>
