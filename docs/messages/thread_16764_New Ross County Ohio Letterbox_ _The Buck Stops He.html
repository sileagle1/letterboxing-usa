03 by Salamander. Difficulty: Easy. *** This box is located in St. <br/>
Margaret's Cemetery, on Worthington Avenue in Chillicothe, Ohio. For <br/>
driving directions, please see clues for "Handiwork", placed by <br/>
Salamander.   CLUES: Upon entering the cemetery, you must go to the <br/>
left. Keep bearing left whenever you come to a crossroads. At <br/>
about .2 mile from the entrance, start looking for two monuments, <br/>
which will be on your left. One is a large white cross, while a bit <br/>
behind it and to the right is a black granite marker which is shaped <br/>
like a square balancing on one of its corners.  Stand behind the <br/>
black monument and take a compass reading of 300 degrees. Ten paces <br/>
at this heading will bring you to a tree with a stump right up <br/>
against it.  Here you will find the letterbox, under a pile of rocks <br/>
and leaves.<br/>
