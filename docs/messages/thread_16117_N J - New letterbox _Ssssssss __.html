<br/>
Your quest begins by finding telephone pole # "H21780" on Tuckerton<br/>
Road, Tabernacle.  Be very careful, this location has been the<br/>
sighting of a pretty good size rattlesnake recently.  <br/>
<br/>
Take a compass reading from the telephone pole.  Walk across the black<br/>
top road to the dirt road at 300 degrees.  Walk south down the dirt<br/>
road and look for the alcove on your immediate left.  <br/>
<br/>
Standing at the tree at the point of the alcove (tree has been hacked<br/>
real bad in the past) walk 120 degrees 15 paces.  There is a bunch of<br/>
branches at its base.  From this location, walk 240 degrees 11 paces<br/>
to the tree that grows next to a tree with its small dead and broken<br/>
brother.  (hint:  opposite point of alcove)  For the next jaunt,<br/>
proceed at 170 degrees 23 paces down the worn out path, no high<br/>
stepping is required.  Look ahead for the triangle tree that will bear<br/>
your treasure.  Thank you for stamping in. Please return it to it's<br/>
proper resting spot and please cover well. Thank you. <br/>
<br/>
Always proceed at your discretion. The owner of this letterbox assumes<br/>
no responsibility for your actions or any occurrence to you or your<br/>
company on this hunt. Please remember you are in a state forest.<br/>
Remember pack in pack out your trash and only you can prevent forest<br/>
fires. Treat this forest as if it were your home. Tread lightly. <br/>
<br/>
