The reason I ask, is because the Clue List on the NALB site lists <br/>
the number of boxes there as 1. Yet the body copy of the clue <br/>
implies (no -  it *states), that there's a *second* box to be found <br/>
on the exit from the park.<br/>
<br/>
Newbie Hint Two: Don't clean off the found letterbox with your <br/>
Clue Sheet, thereby obliterating it. Bring a hanky, or sumpin'.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't tell me I passed a box on the way out. Please?<br/>
<br/>
*grin*<br/>
<br/>
Not that I'd mind going back - It's a lovely site. Bring a camera.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are two clue listings for Tyler, one called Tyler, the other <br/>
called Schofield.  You are definitely correct that it says in the <br/>
Schofield clues that there are two boxes, but only one on the main <br/>
listing.  I have found both of the boxes in the Schofield listing <br/>
within the last few months, so hopefully they are still there.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the other listing for Tyler, you'll see these same <br/>
clues for Schofield are listed again along with two other boxes, one <br/>
of which is MIA.  I can't speak for those boxes, just the ones by <br/>
Schofield.  So that clue listing indicates another three boxes at <br/>
Tyler, but really there's only one more.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that wasn't too confusing!  I think under the "old" site this <br/>
used to be one big clue of four boxes - someone must have goofed when <br/>
it was moved over to the new site.<br/>

Happy Hunting!<br/>

Thanks, Jenn!<br/>
<br/>
We were going to check it anyway, when we went back for the <br/>
remaining box at Tyler. But your confirmation will help us <br/>
schedule the hunt a little better.<br/>
