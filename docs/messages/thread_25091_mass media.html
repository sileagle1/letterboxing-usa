Why would this community not jump up and down about the idea of adding to the ranks of letterboxers out there.  We just started thanks to a tiny little mention in an MSN article about fun things to do with your family this summer.  It didn't tell what it was, in fact it was mentioned in conjunction with geocaching, which I consider to be treasure hunting for junk.  None the less I was intrigued enough to find out what it was.  I am proud to say that we found our first two boxes while we were on vacation a couple of weeks ago.  My kids have asked me every day for a week now when we get to go find another box and we just got permission to plant our first box.  We are proud to have joined this group.  My kids are 4 &amp; 6 and have no concept of the history of the hobby, but the idea of a treasure hunt is an astounding motivator.  Part of the fun for them was deciding which of the colors of ink we brought was best for each of the stamps.  So maybe there are a few who try and don't come back, looking for somehting more exciting.  What if there are just a few who have found a wonderful new hobby that they never would have found otherwise.  To be honest I, I figured if I had never heard of it, it couldn't be that widespread and that we would never find ones close enough to make it happen.  Imagine my surprise to find over 400 boxes in our backyard without even knowing they were there.  We have shared this with friends and cousins and two sets of grandparents.  We are having so much fun we want to share it with all our friends and family.    <br/>

Adding to the ranks is one thing, but adding to the ranks a bunch of folks that go into the game/hobby uninformed is quite another.<br/>
Many articles (Time Mag for example) leave much to be desired when it comes to explaning nuances particularly stealth.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the articles I've seen are quick glimpses into Letterboxing, and most of the writers and their editors could care a hoot about Letterboxing. They are there to sell their product not to sell Letterboxing. Without learning more about letterboxing boxes tend not to be rehidden properly, new boxers plant then leave unmaintained boxes behind (trash)or clues posted without boxes at the end of the hike (clue trash). <br/>
<br/>
Everytime I hear about the Time Mag article I cringe. We lost 15 boxes in the first week after that article came out.<br/>

Don has a point, but the non-maintenance of clues and boxes is not exclusive to new letterboxers.  Angie I just want to welcome you to letterboxing and say I'm so glad to hear you and your family are having so much fun - that's the name of the game, or one of the names!  I could just see your kids sitting around deciding what colors to use - I love boxing with kids for that very reason.  Happy trails.<br/>

Exactly, because it is more than finding a box, planting a box, writing a clue.  There are the events, the new friends, the history (including the research!), the chat lists -- these are often not revealed or emphasized in the media.  And events, friends, chat lists are how one can learn the nuances and maybe a few nuisances ;^) <br/>

me.   I don't think we as a hobby should hire a PR firm, but recognize there<br/>
are potential positive things from mass media as well as negative.<br/>
<br/>
Also, keep this in mind:  One of the greatest boxes I ever found was at the<br/>
end of a hilly, hot 2-mile hike deep in a Utah canyon.  Pretty sure that not<br/>
too many n00bs, or families with eighteen kids that would attract a lot of<br/>
attention from outsiders would undertake that particular journey.  So we<br/>
have other ways of keeping boxes safe if we don't want new waves of media<br/>
wannabes from finding (and/or wrecking/losing/breaking/exposing) our stuff.<br/>

I know ppl on this list hate that Time Magazine article, but it changed my<br/>
life, so I'm willing to stand up for it.<br/>

So true, but part of that relativity is the audience the article reaches.The audience that receives Smithsonian may be far different than that of Time Mag. (no reflection is being made towards all subscibers to Time)<br/>
<br/>
I would think also that due to the small number of letterboxes around the country when the Smithsonian article hit was quite different than the number that was planted when the Time Mag article was published.<br/>
That would make a difference in the potential detrimental effects the articles have on letterboxing just due to the numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Having TV shows with even less details could be problimatic primarily due to the audience it reaches.<br/>
<br/>
All this tends to sound a little "high and mighty" but my point was merely to mention that the best way to have Letterboxing grow is through a "one on one" or "word of mouth" contact where some of the nuances can be transmitted rather than through mass media.<br/>
<br/>
One of the better articles on Letterboxing was written for the LA Times. I was contacted by the writer and I spent quite a bit of time explaining why I didn't really want to be quoted or cooperate with her.<br/>
My "lack" of cooperation worked pretty well as she did emphasize stealth in the article. <br/>

But with our recent Back to Our Roots gathering in VT, one of the stipulations for the local economic grant we were awarded was to do publicity. That left us in a very unique situation. <br/>
<br/>
Our interviews with 2 of the local newspapers which turned into feature articles did a fine job stressing all of those items that we talk about here on this talk list - leave no trace, do not let children rehide boxes, leave boxes hidden better than were found (from all angles), "blessing" the box with area debris like sticks, leaves, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I have to say that they did a very fine job. Silver Eagle has a valid point but one I just learned from the above experience. If we leave them to write the story, they will surely miss a key point or two. If we keep stressing the importance of the main items, hopefully they will eventually get across. <br/>

OTOH, the more people you tell about something, the more<br/>
quality and innovating people you are likely to attract,<br/>
that will expand the hobby in interesting and exciting ways :)<br/>
<br/>
I just think this whole presumption that the masses are<br/>
heathen and will destroy the hobby, while readers who<br/>
happen to read Smithsonian instead of Time won't, is, well,<br/>
high and mighty, or whatever the phrase was.  And it just<br/>
doesn't agree with me, as it presumes something negative<br/>
about someone you have no reason to assume something negative<br/>
about until they give you reason to.  Why not assume something<br/>
positive about the unwashed masses, until they do something<br/>
disagreeable?<br/>
<br/>
As I said, there are alot of people who believe readers<br/>
of the Smithsonian destroyed the hobby (OMG, look what<br/>
the Yanks are doing to our quaint, secretive, hobby.  And,<br/>
quite frankly, from one frame of reference, it is true).<br/>
That is what I meant by it is all relative.<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting that when you actually reread the Smithsonian<br/>
article, there is no mention of rehide the box better, and all<br/>
this other stuff people are talking about that the media should<br/>
say.  Only three points of etiquette are mentioned, a clue<br/>
exchange protocol that the Yanks have chosen to ignore (so,<br/>
what was the point of telling the reporter that?), a reference<br/>
to working with park people (most Yanks have chosen to ignore<br/>
this also), and a vague reference to a "code of conduct", with<br/>
no specifics spelled out or an external reference.  I maintain --<br/>
what's the difference?<br/>
<br/>
This whole thing reminds me of suing gun manufacturers for<br/>
crimes committed with guns, despite the fact that the vast majority<br/>
of gun owners do not commit crimes with guns.  While I see the<br/>
logic of this argument, I just don't agree with it.  By this<br/>
logic, everything should be kept secret, otherwise someone may do<br/>
something bad with it.  I'm not sure I buy it, but WDIK?  I don't<br/>
think we should give knives or baseball bats to the masses either.<br/>
Nuclear bombs, perhaps a different kettle of fish :)<br/>
<br/>
As for the Time article, it is an interesting story, as I spent a<br/>
ton of time with that reporter.  I was traveling in Europe at the<br/>
time, and I remember nightly calls discussing my views on the game<br/>
of letterboxing.  Unlike the Smithsonian, I don't have the article<br/>
in front of me right now, but IIRC, not a single point or idea of<br/>
mine was used therein (I could be wrong on this, but that is my<br/>
memory of it).  Just goes to show that they will still write<br/>
what they want.  And it is not like there is a unified voice<br/>
anyway.  I'm just gonna tell them what I want to, even if it<br/>
disagrees with how others think the game should be played, or<br/>
what they or their editor want to hear.  (I think a reasonable<br/>
argument can be made that there _should_ be a unified voice,<br/>
but that is for another time (this is very important in other<br/>
hobbies), but for now, as long as we are not irresponsible in<br/>
what we tell them, I don't think it matters if we disagree on the<br/>
details of how the game should be played).<br/>
<br/>
There is another interesting point about the Smithsonian article<br/>
that alludes back to some other comments made in this thread.  One<br/>
is describing it as "orienteering", with which it has absolutely<br/>
zero in common (orienteering is 50% map reading, 50% running,<br/>
more or less -- neither skill is used in the letterboxing described<br/>
in the article (serious orienteers do not use a compass to take<br/>
bearings, in fact, most use a different kind of compass entirely<br/>
where taking bearings makes no sense)), so it just goes to show<br/>
that even the high and mighty Smithsonian gets it wrong sometimes,<br/>
so I think we can forgive our reporters for doing so along the same<br/>
lines.<br/>
<br/>
The other is this alluding to "treasure hunting".  Even the Smithsonian<br/>
did it.  I actually think it is a good thing.  As an actual treasure<br/>
hunter, I can say with some confidence that what we get out of the hobby<br/>
is the thrill of the hunt, not the prize or PFX numbers.  Moreover,<br/>
each treasure found has that chance to be special, not a commodity<br/>
(commodity items in treasure hunting are often held with disdain, or<br/>
at best, indifference or nothing special).  So, I for one, actually<br/>
like this emphasis.  Most treasure hunters enjoy spending hours<br/>
researching that special place that perhaps no one else has found,<br/>
that may hold something cool, rather than spending 20 hours picking<br/>
up pennies in a playground one after the next and boasting about it.<br/>
So, to me, this metaphor is a good thing, and hope reporters keep<br/>
pushing it.<br/>
<br/>
JMHO, of course,<br/>
Randy<br/>
never short of opinions, devil's advocacy, or being high and mighty in<br/>
different ways :)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
"All this tends to sound a little "high and mighty" but my point was merely to<br/>
mention that the best way to have Letterboxing grow is through a "one on one" or<br/>
"word of mouth" contact where some of the nuances can be transmitted rather than<br/>
through mass media."<br/>
<br/>
Articles no matter how well written can compare to introducing someone to letterboxing first hand. Mentoring them and sharing the pursuit of a letterbox seems to me a better method.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing was said about the unwashed masses, but certainly personal contact would be a better introduction than just scanning whatever article you wish to cite.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately many new letterboxers find this site through an article, ask some questions that have been hashed, and rehashed here and end up getting slammed or flamed. So remaining in the hobby tends to be either luck in not asking "What is a Hitch Hiker", or a very thick skin.<br/>
<br/>
Personal attention on the otherhand can help those newboxers get to a point so that they understand where their questions can be answered without rancor or better yet where they can find answers on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Thus eventually making a better letterboxer that can add quality and innovation and expand the hobby in interesting and exciting ways that will be a benefit to the hobby.<br/>

So while you like to have the "blast away" method that you prefer that can run off many folks that could be a great new creative input to the hobby. Maybe that is why this list has had a dwindling membership while the letterboxing hobby has grown.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Nothing was said about the unwashed masses, but certainly <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt; personal contact would be a better introduction than just<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; scanning whatever article you wish to cite.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, we'll agree to disagree on this and other points.  Note<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; that my comments _were specifically_ about the Smithsonian<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; article, without which, not too many people reading this would<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; be here.  Of course I'm citing the article I mentioned.  That's<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the whole point.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And yes, the readers of Time and other mass media (in the past<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and now), _have_ been disparaged along the lines of unwashed<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; masses (I even have private mail that uses that exact term),<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; while everyone (except perhaps myself) from the Smithsonian<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; class is never questioned.  I personally find that, and the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; elitism in letterboxing in general, ridiculous.  This anti<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; mass media is just elitism, IMHO.  I will say that the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Smithsonian class had no one telling us to rehide boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The geniuses that we are -- we figured that one out all<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; on our own :-)  I, at least, give newbies (I mean, I was one<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; once), the credit to also do so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately many new letterboxers find this site through an article, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt; ask some questions that have been hashed, and rehashed here and<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt; end up getting slammed or flamed. [...] Personal attention on the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; otherhand can help those newboxers [...]<br/>

Well....although I am not of the unwashed elites...I will now speak<br/>
out for them on their behalf...  <br/>
<br/>
So... we should all be thankful to the unwashed elites... namely: to Bernie Madoff, Michael Milken, George Soros, Gordon Gekko (ala Blue<br/>
Horse Shoe loves Blue Star Airlines) and all the members of Skull &amp; Bones and the Illuminati...  For if it were not for them, we<br/>
might not really know the true stench that some of our fellow man<br/>
can carry around with them...<br/>
<br/>
I thank them for reminding me that I am grateful to be among <br/>
the 'regular folk'...<br/>
<br/>
Oh..  we were talking about letterboxing...?   hmmm....<br/>

<br/>
I'm not interested in taking sides in such a battle of the wills on <br/>
here or any other board...  But, with regard to Letterboxing...  the <br/>
hobby is growing because people not only are looking to get out more,<br/>
but they are also looking for a "cheaper" way to have some fun and<br/>
be active at the same time. (although it's debateable how 'cheap' this hobby really is)  Lousy Economic times will do that to you.<br/>
...I doubt that this list or any other would affect a great number of<br/>
people... <br/>

article, showed it to my husband, he was interested, but we didn't do <br/>
anything about it until I got laid off and had time to research the <br/>
subject. We started slow - 5 finds in 2004 - but have been going strong <br/>
ever since.<br/>

I thought the Time article was fine, certainly better than the various <br/>
mentions in Family Fun and others of that ilk.<br/>

I didn't say anything about whether I believe the list is "newboxer friendly" or not. My comment is that it's sloppy debating to take a statement made about one topic, change the context of one of the words, and then answer as if the person making the statement had said something else.<br/>

(Hence, the mention of dead lemurs -- for fellow newbies, that's a reference akin to "beating a dead horse" or a commentary that a topic has been talked to death now, so let's drop it and find something new to talk about.)  I myself just read the first 4-5 postings, then skip through all the rest of the heavy artillery and look for the next topic.<br/>

of the article, and thanks goes to Rick for posting a link to it.  I'm <br/>
another who was introduced to the idea of letterboxing by someone who <br/>
had seen an article in a magazine.  I never saw the article, but my <br/>
daughter, who spotted it and knew it would be something I would like, <br/>
copied down the web site for LBNA and the rest for me is history.<br/>
<br/>
And at the risk of making a few people mad at me, which in truth is not <br/>
going to cause me to lose any sleep, because I live by the philosophy of <br/>
"if the shoe fits, wear it", some people participating in this thread <br/>
maybe should have one of my personal travelers.  When you see them <br/>
you'll know which one I'm talking about.<br/>

entertaining as it is and has lately provided me welcome diversion from <br/>
my work, which happens to involve me sitting at my computer all day.<br/>

And as long as you ask, my first finds were two boxes placed by DebRocks in Bloomington, MN (Minnesota Valley Wildlife Refuge - Bass Ponds).  Ironically (or was it letterbox karma?) she was the first letterboxer I ever met in person, at that very gathering in 2004. <br/>

We started boxing before the Time Magazine article.  We actually were at the gathering in IL that a reporter and photographer attended to do the article.  We didn't talk to them much (they were tagging along with some other letterboxers) but some of the photos in the Time article were from the IL event.<br/>

 Some of you might be interested in a little article rom the Nov. 2006 issue of a magazine called Games. HnH set some ground rules for the reporter, she had to come on a hike and actualy find a few boxes, she had to have a stamp and trail name(we made her Lois Lane) and there had to be a picture of her dog. All in all a comprehensive article. Longer than most blurbs in local papers.<br/>

I just read the article and although I may have read the article before, I'm<br/>
not sure. It turns out I know every person mentioned in that story and I<br/>
think the article DID do a good job of emphasizing secrecy, artistry,<br/>
challenge, respect, supervision and expectations.<br/>

I don't often post to online letterboxing discussions - either here or on AQ<br/>
- but I read them pretty faithfully. There are likely many of us out here<br/>
who would not bother to post an answer to this question after the rough<br/>
replies some have given...<br/>
<br/>
But, since I've aleready jumped in, here's another one for you all: I'm of<br/>
the "Metro Parent" generation. For those who didn't like the previous<br/>
articles, you're probably going to hate this one, but I think it was a<br/>
pretty fair representation and it certainly got us going in the wonderful<br/>
sport/hobby!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know that Jessica spent a lot of time corresponding with those of us that were interviewed for the article, and I think she did a pretty good job. It goes more in depth than some one-page articles I've seen, and it covers many of the important points.  Of course, I'm partial, because I wanted to stress the stealth aspect and she handled that well.  I've always been a believer that they're going to write the article with or without me, so I may as well try to speak my peace while I have the opportunity.<br/>
