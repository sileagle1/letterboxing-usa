letterboxing after we learned about it because we agonized over <br/>
everything!   Whether or not to hand carve a stamp (and what would we <br/>
carve) or use a store bought one, and then what to use for a personal <br/>
journal.  We already own lots of rubber stamps and each had more than one <br/>
we thought would be great personal stamps, but in the end decided to hand <br/>
carve.  So then there were trips to the art supply store to look at carving <br/>
mediums, followed by many drafts of what to carve.  The easiest thing for <br/>
us was probably the journal, which we wanted to be really special, but <br/>
sturdy, compact and have lots of pages.  We already knew about a place that <br/>
offered just we wanted - Acorn Design's (a local business) pocket journal, <br/>
which features beautiful original nature themed art - check them out at <br/>
www.acorndesigns.org<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, imagine our disappointment when we FINALLY began letterboxing and <br/>
discovered that LOTS of people use store bought stamps - we weren't <br/>
disappointed with them, only that we'd waited so long to start letterboxing <br/>
when we probably would have been very happy with the store bought stamps we <br/>
originally had in mind!  Of course, our hand carved stamps are unique, <br/>
especially mine - I put my initials on it and forgot to carve them <br/>
backwards, so the first time I used it in a log book we all had a good <br/>
laugh.  I was going to just cut them off, but have since been convinced to <br/>
leave them so we can have a chuckle with each stamping.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is you won't be alone if you use a store bought stamp as a <br/>
personal stamp, and you can still have lots of fun hand carving stamps if <br/>
you plant boxes!<br/>
