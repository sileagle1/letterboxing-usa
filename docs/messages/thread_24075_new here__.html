Hey Karolyn!!! I can't wiat to see everyone when we come up! I am <br/>
counting the days! <br/>
<br/>
I found my first one in FL today! It was a bit scary for me. I had to <br/>
go in the woods along a trail and I came face to face with a couple <br/>
large spiders and webs and I saw lots of holes in the ground which I <br/>
took being snake holes or something scary. I am a New Englander and I <br/>
am not used to all this wildlife in FL. EEK! <br/>

&gt; &gt; told about LB has gotten into big time! SHe has hidden over 20 <br/>
&gt; boxes <br/>
&gt; &gt; herself and found over 160! I am going to look for some <br/>
mastercarve <br/>
&gt; &gt; tomorrow and while I am in the area look for some leterboxes. I <br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; &gt; some wonderful places around here to hide some but I want to find <br/>
&gt; at <br/>
&gt; &gt; least 20 first before I hide any. There is so much uncharted <br/>
&gt; territory <br/>
&gt; &gt; here!!<br/>
