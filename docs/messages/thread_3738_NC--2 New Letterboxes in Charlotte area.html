the Latta Plantation Nature Preserve.<br/>
<br/>
The Bible Belt Letterboxes (2)<br/>
Charlotte, NC<br/>
Planted by Amanda from Seattle<br/>

<br/>
The Bible Belt Letterboxes are located in Latta Plantation Nature <br/>
Preserve. <br/>
(as a side note, my great, great, great aunt was Jane Knox Latta and <br/>
she lived here in the 1800's. <br/>
 The Property is now a Nature Preserve with a Raptor Center and <br/>
Equestrian Center)<br/>
<br/>
 To reach the Preserve,<br/>
If traveling North on I-77<br/>
Exit 16B, Sunset Road West, to Beatties Ford Road.  Turn Right and <br/>
proceed North for 4.8 miles until you reach Sample Road.  Turn left <br/>
onto Sample Road and continue 1 mile to the preserve entrance.<br/>
If traveling South on I-77<br/>
Exit 23, Huntersville.  Turn right off of the exit onto Gilead Road.  <br/>
Take the third left, McCoy Road.  At the stop sign, turn right onto <br/>
Beatties Ford Road.  Turn Left onto Sample Road and continue 1 mile <br/>
to preserve entrance.<br/>
<br/>
Stop at the Nature Center and pick up a Trail Map or there are Map <br/>
Signs at each Trailhead.  To figure out the directions and numbers in <br/>
the clues, you will need a King James version of the Bible.<br/>
<br/>

Bible Belt Letterboxes (2)<br/>
1. The Fleur-de-lis Letterbox<br/>
The Fleur-de-lis is a stylized representation of the lily, a symbol <br/>
of purity, and so is a common reference to the Virgin Mary.  The <br/>
fleur-de-lis is also a symbol of royalty, made so by its adoption by <br/>
the kings of France.  The triune representation of the fleur-de-lis <br/>
has also led to its adoption as a symbol of the Trinity.<br/>
<br/>
Park at the sign for the boat rental harbor in the horse trailer <br/>
parking lot.  Take the Beechwood Trail.<br/>
When you come to a T go (Job 26:7)<br/>
Pass the 3rd Bench (it faces Numbers 34:6) and continue until you <br/>
see a tree on your left.  This tree is bent over to form an L.  <br/>
(Joshua 10:16) steps off the path at (Leviticus 27:4) degees is a <br/>
tree of three.  The Fleur-de-lis letterbox is hidden behind the tree <br/>
under some branches and leaves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.Noah's Ark Letterbox<br/>
Noah's Ark is symbolic of God's judgment on sin and His promise of <br/>
salvation and provision for His people.  <br/>
<br/>
Go to the Parking Lot for the Buzzard Rock Trail.  When the trail <br/>
splits, go (Proverbs 25:23).  When you reach the lake viewpoint, <br/>
follow the fence rail (Daniel 11:9) to a red and white striped trail <br/>
marker.  Go down this small side trail until you come to a tree <br/>
across the path.  (Genesis 31:23) steps  (Hosea 11:10) along this <br/>
downed tree is the Noah's Ark Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet and replace everything hidden as you found it or <br/>
better.  Read the Waiver of responsibility and disclaimer.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
