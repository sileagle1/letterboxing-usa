     Hello.  I also read that article in the dispatch and fell in <br/>
love with the idea of letterboxing.  I spend a lot of time in state <br/>
parks anyway, and it seemed like a cool hobby.  Since the article <br/>
came out, I have been franticly running around the state trying to <br/>
catch up with everybody else.  So far, I have found twelve boxes but <br/>
have planted only one.(I just posted it last night) E-mail me if you <br/>
need any questions answered.  I am quickly becoming an expert on the <br/>
subjet of letterbox.  Also, I live in the east side of Columbus and <br/>
I know where a lot of local boxes are.<br/>

&gt; Hey Paul.  My stamp is the Wedjat Eye, commonly reffered to <br/>
as "The <br/>
&gt; Eye Of Horus."  You could probably find a picture of it on any <br/>
&gt; quality egyptian history website.  I carved it out of a white eraser <br/>
&gt; made by school selects. My first day or two, I was using a <br/>
similar <br/>
&gt; stamp made out of wood, but the reslts were not exactly what I <br/>
&gt; expected.  Erasers work much, much better.  When you do go <br/>
to carve <br/>
&gt; your stamp, try and pick something that is special to you.  I am <br/>
&gt; going to try and keep an egytpian theme to all of my stamps, to <br/>
&gt; share with other Lb'ers my love for ancient egypt. As for where <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; start, I found the boxes of Seeker Of Flags first. (if you <br/>
remember, <br/>
&gt; she was the woman in the dispatch article) They are located in <br/>
Deer <br/>
&gt; Creek S.P. and in Battle-Darby metro park.  The deer creek <br/>
ones were <br/>
&gt; exceptionally easy, but still a great place to start learning the <br/>
&gt; game.  You could also go out and find mine as well. Let me <br/>
know how <br/>
&gt; that helps.<br/>

&gt; &gt;      Hello.  I also read that article in the dispatch and fell in <br/>
&gt; &gt; love with the idea of letterboxing.  I spend a lot of time in <br/>
&gt; state <br/>
&gt; &gt; parks anyway, and it seemed like a cool hobby.  Since the <br/>
article <br/>
&gt; &gt; came out, I have been franticly running around the state trying <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; catch up with everybody else.  So far, I have found twelve <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; but <br/>
&gt; &gt; have planted only one.(I just posted it last night) E-mail me if <br/>
&gt; you <br/>
&gt; &gt; need any questions answered.  I am quickly becoming an <br/>
expert on <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; subjet of letterbox.  Also, I live in the east side of Columbus <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; I know where a lot of local boxes are.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  i am very new to letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just read about it in the Columbus ( Ohio ) Dispatch.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've been backpacking many years ago and love to hike the <br/>
parks <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hills of Ohio.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This seems like a wonderful "reason" to stretch my legs <br/>
after a <br/>
&gt; &gt; long<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Winter.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am located in the NW Corner of Columbus.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Are there any other letter boxers nearby?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone who can give me some starting hints?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Happy Thursday All,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>
