placed on: 12-25-02<br/>
location: Willow Creek Rec. Area<br/>
nearest city: Pierce, NE, USA<br/>
county: Pierce<br/>
clue/difficulty: easyeasyeasy<br/>
<br/>
This box is just over 15 miles from Norfolk, NE (the nearest major town), <br/>
and would make an easy bike ride if you're not worried about insane traffic <br/>
consisting mainly of pickup trucks that aren't looking where they're going.<br/>
<br/>
The Willow Creek Recreation Area is a relatively new addition (within the <br/>
last few years) to the parks in this area.  Created by a state-sponsored <br/>
dam project, it serves as a flood plain and watershed, as well as a place <br/>
to camp, swim, and generally hang out somewhere with water. (Or, if you go <br/>
in the winter as I did, ice.)<br/>
<br/>
To get to the area itself, just follow the signs from any  of the three <br/>
highways coming into Pierce, NE.  (A town of 1200, so the signs aren't hard <br/>
to find.)  You'll go past a small convenience store, and about a mile <br/>
later, turn left toward the Willow Rose B&amp;B sign.  Go past the B&amp;B, a road <br/>
for maintenance, and a weirdly placed cemetary to get to the turn-off on <br/>
the right for the rec. area itself.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the signs toward the Camping Area.  You'll stay left when the road <br/>
has a slight "Y", and at the stop sign, turn right.  Just through the gates <br/>
that tell you the rules and who the park is sponsored by, but before the <br/>
camping area itself, you'll see an area on the right with a walk-out <br/>
lookout over the water.  Turn in that picnic area.<br/>
<br/>
At the north end, there is a sign that tells you the Group Camping Area is <br/>
accesible to Foot Traffic Only.<br/>
<br/>
 From this sign, go 35 paces.  On your left will be a low tree that's full <br/>
and bushlike, set about three or four feet off the trail.<br/>
<br/>
The box is at it's base, on the north side, covered by grasses and leaves.<br/>
<br/>
please be careful to hide the box back under grass and leaves, as it's very <br/>
visible otherwise.  (Lack of undergrowth, at least in the winter.)  It may <br/>
be inaccessible in times of heavy or deep snow.<br/>
