After a winter of crappy weather, it was great to get out in the sun <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Nockum Hill Turtle in Barrington was found in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Meander to the Marsh: Great Blue Heron and Red Fox in Warren were <br/>
found in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
The World Needs Peace in Bristol was found in place, dry, and <br/>
intact.  A washed-up beam was the perfect place for a picnic by the <br/>
bay.<br/>
<br/>
East Bay Bike Path Series I: Chair Wheeler, Coffee Break, Roller <br/>
Blader, Tired Cyclist, and Walker were all found in place.  The box <br/>
for Roller Blader was damaged and full of water, so we replaced the <br/>
box and bags.  The log was a little wet, but not bad.  The other four <br/>
boxes were dry and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all!<br/>
