my personal stamp a word stamp (which I carved). I<br/>
like it but it was a little on the large side so I<br/>
couldn't stamp it in every log book. <br/>
<br/>
This year I'm sharing my life with my new dog so I<br/>
decided to change my stamp for 2005 to a carved stamp<br/>
of my pooch, who I LB with. <br/>
<br/>
Who knows, maybe I'll change my stamp yearly to<br/>
commemorate some event in my life. Time will tell.<br/>

What's important to you? What kind of impression (<br/>
pardon the pun) do you want to leave with people. Do<br/>
you have any hobbies? anything that would look really<br/>
nice as a stamp? For me my personal stamp was easy,<br/>
I'm a juggler so my stamp should be of a juggler. It<br/>
took 2.5 hours to carve and was worth every minute of<br/>
it. When I stamp in I know I'm leaving a piece of who<br/>
I am at every box I've visited. I feel your personal<br/>
stamp should also be the nicest one you've carved, of<br/>
course you should do your best on all stamps that<br/>
you're placing in boxes for others to find, but<br/>
knowing you're leaving a great stamp for others really<br/>
feels  good, like you're giving them a brief glimpse<br/>
of who you are and what you're all about. Maybe I'm<br/>
over romanticizing this whole thing and probably not<br/>
making it easier for the two of you to decide on what<br/>
to carve. Worst case scenario, you carve something now<br/>
and decide to change it later. My first stamp paled in<br/>
comparison to what I have now, but it was a<br/>
 place to start and I liked it at the time. You don't<br/>
have to be stuck with only one personal stamp. It's<br/>
too late and I'm rambling on and on and on and<br/>
on......................Good luck with the decision<br/>
making and the carving. Let me know what you decide<br/>
on, I'd be interested to know. Who knows, someday you<br/>
might see my stamp in one of your logbooks or<br/>
vice-verse. Take care, happy hunting.                 <br/>
