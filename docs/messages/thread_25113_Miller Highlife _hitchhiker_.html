                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi to all in LB land,  Today we retrieved from the "Overlook Letterbox"  two small pads with all kinds of stamps in it,starting in Canton,Ohio. This is the first time i had ever seen such a thing. It is in my possession right now they will travel to another letterbox soon. i guess the two separate little pads should be kept together as a set. It was difficult to get to this letterbox as there were so many people out today hiking, the most i ever saw up this mountain. Over 50  in an hour for sure. Must have been the one nice day we have had here in a while that attracted everyone or was it because it was the 1st day of August?.<br/>
