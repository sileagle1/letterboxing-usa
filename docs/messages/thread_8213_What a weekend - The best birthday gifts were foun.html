all! </span></div>
<div><span class="450391123-06102002">Saturday we flew off to RI and  5 found wonderful 
boxes! Such fun! </span></div>
<div><span class="450391123-06102002">Today 
we hung around CT and visited Lebanon and Windham and came back with 6 
boxes. History stamps tend to be a favorite of mine. Sad to say that 
we couldn't get the 1st box on the loop because they are rebuilding the walk-way 
right at the box!</span></div>

Fox triumphed over his 100th find today leaving me (Irishtinker) at 98 finds. 
Maybe tomorrow if it doesn't rain too much I will reach 100 on my actual 
birthday! </span></div>

hmm there is something else....what is it....hmm...oh yes now I remember. After 
hours and hours of going buggy eyed, scratching our heads and occasionally
