<br/>
You are all invited to the DC area Winter Gathering.<br/>
<br/>
When: Saturday, January 18, 2003  11:30 a.m. - 3:30 p.m.<br/>
Where:  Clyde's Restaurant of Columbia.  Wincopin Circle, Columbia, MD  in the "Library" part of the restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
Because this is a restaurant, I'm going to need to get a firmer count on how many people are planning to attend.  But I really don't need to know this until we get closer to the date.  So don't feel the need to RSVP right now - I'll ask this question again in January!<br/>
<br/>
Preliminary counts suggest that there will be over 30 people attending.  Because of this, Clyde's is going to give separate checks to each table.  Also, a 20% gratuity will be added to your check.  I hope this is ok!<br/>
<br/>
So mark your calendars!  Clear your schedules!  Drive, fly, run to the wilds of Columbia, MD for the very exciting Winter Gathering!<br/>

We're quite new to the letterboxing experience and are completely hooked.<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to meeting some other LBNA nuts.<br/>
