the last word on delivery of materials. As usual delays will the slow <br/>
the  completion of your Town Gazebo. Our contract had no closing date <br/>
which you may consider the next time you get a crew to build a Town <br/>
gazebo.  The cupola arrived intact today. You may pick it up in <br/>
Baltic, Ct. but I advise you to await the roof delivery as the cupola <br/>
sits on it. If you have not done any construction yet you could begin <br/>
with the cupola and  save the 4x6 space for the remaining sections.  <br/>
Watch the list for the link needed to recieve the  directions on the <br/>
Cupola piece. (psychokiwi will be  setting link-  (R.A.L.K.))<br/>
     It was the cold rain here which caused delay as we are in the <br/>
construction business second to farming and with the cold rain we <br/>
came home to put animals in the barn  and dry them instead of <br/>
continuing on to complete the  gazebo. Hopefully the weekend will see <br/>
delivery of the remaining pieces of gazebo but be wary weekends mean <br/>
overtime.    Leader of the Pack<br/>
