                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just got back from California, so here's a report on boxes found (and not <br/>
found) in the San Francisco area:<br/>
<br/>
I found the Loma Prieta Earthquake box in fine shape. The redwood forest <br/>
there is incredible; I wish I could bring the smell home with me! However, <br/>
the trail map that the park provides is misleading about the location of <br/>
the Aptos Creek trail, so I lost some time on false starts and trying to <br/>
figure out where the trail was.<br/>
<br/>
Turtle McQ joined me on Friday and we found both Coyote Creek boxes in San <br/>
Jose, and then both Meyer's Ranch boxes in Union City (we were the first to <br/>
find those). We both liked the Dry Creek park and the clues for the Meyer's <br/>
Ranch boxes -- except for having to watch every step because of the cow <br/>
patties!<br/>
<br/>
We also picked up the West Coast Clone Hitchhiker and booked it on a <br/>
transcontinental flight to the East coast to aid in its search for its <br/>
counterpart. (FWIW, this was the 3rd hitchhiker I'd found in 60 boxes!)<br/>
<br/>
We were unable to find the Eagle Rock box in Alum Rock park. We looked for <br/>
quite a while, but had no luck. Since the Mineral Baths box was already <br/>
reported missing, we didn't even try to find the 3rd box in that series. It <br/>
was a nice view from the rock, though!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you. I am glad that you both enjoyed the hike at Dry Creek <br/>
park. Lizardbutt hates the cow dung, but he does enjoy dodging the <br/>
patties on his bike. <br/>
Great, the West Coast Clone has some frequent flier miles. Love those <br/>
1K perks! <br/>
