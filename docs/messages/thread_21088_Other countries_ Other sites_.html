I also noticed someone said there are boxes in other countries - where can I <br/>

by finding my first two boxes on November 26 in the Keys in Florida. Then <br/>
found two more in California last weekend. <br/>

Thanks for your help!<br/>

Gwen &amp; I spent 4 days in the Monterey/Big Sur area, and picked up 16 <br/>
letterboxes. If you only have a weekend I think you will find that <br/>
the letterboxes listed on LBNA will be enough to look for. <br/>
Mtnbikemanns just posted another 3. If you go to Yahoo groups home <br/>
page and type in Letterboxing you will find many listings and chat <br/>
lists. You can also check the web ring at the bottom of the LBNA <br/>
page. You can peruse the links section at the left hand side of this <br/>
chat list page for sites as well.<br/>

www.atlasquest.com/ has probably the best format for other <br/>
countries, but it has not been used to any extent. When we planted 3 <br/>
in Sweden we kept "Sweden" in the titles so that you can go <br/>
to "Search for boxes" at LBNA, type in Sweden, and you can pull them <br/>
up. They are listed at Atlas Quest also. Many letterboxes can be <br/>
Googled also.<br/>
