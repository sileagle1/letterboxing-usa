                    <html><body><br/><br/>Charity walks are a great way to raise money for worthy causes.<br/>On dartmoor in the U.K. these walks are very popular and much sough after.  <br/>It works this way.<br/>A letterbox member lays out a circular walk or trail of around 4 -6 miles with between 15 - 25 boxes with the stamps designed on a theme, say, wild life or flora of the area for instance.<br/>He then choses a deseving charity for the proceeds of the walk. <br/>A clue sheet is then typed up with all the essential information as to where the walk is and the box clues.<br/>Boxes are the wide necked pill pot type and contain just the stamp apart from the last box which contains a visitors book.<br/>The charity walk is then advertised in the club updates and also on various  web sites.<br/>To obtain a clue sheet,you then mail off to the letterboxer who organised the walk with a stamped addressed envelope and a chque made out to the nominated charity (normally around $5)<br/>Of cource this is how the Dartmoor boys do it, but it would possibly need to be modified.<br/>Happy letterboxing <p></p><p><br/></p><hr size="1"/><a href="http://uk.yahoo.com/mail/tagline_xtra/?http://uk.docs.yahoo.com/mail_storage.html"><b>With Yahoo!
