I don't like chit chatting about other peoples clues as I may <br/>
accidently give something away.  I wasn't referring to clues <br/>
I've writtern tho I think sometimes we all try to create the <br/>
sorts of clues we like.<br/>

Aren't all clues, by their nature, integrated to their surroundings?   I just <br/>
want to make sure I'm not missing something good here!  Maybe I should just <br/>
let it go, huh?<br/>

<br/>
Yeah probably :-)<br/>
<br/>
I don't think the concept behind geocache-style clues or my "Hickory<br/>
Trail Run" clue is particularly integrated.  That is to say, it<br/>
is not difficult to find other locations where the structure behind<br/>
these clues will work, and I don't feel there is a whole lot of <br/>
synergy between the specific environment, the clue text, and the <br/>
solving of the clue.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, a couple of my other clues (and many clues by others) have a <br/>
certain synergy with their locations that make in next to impossible <br/>
for the "what makes them cool" to work in other locations.<br/>
<br/>
One example might be the Police song _Synchronicity II_.  The lyrical<br/>
intent falls apart like a house of cards if you replace "dark Scottish<br/>
lake" with just about anything else (e.g., "dark Swedish lake" or "Lake<br/>
Michigan").  The synergy between the lyrics, lyrical intent, and location<br/>
hang together beautifully and intricately, and would be difficult to<br/>
duplicate elsewhere, and the whole song, and the way what is said is<br/>
said, has never been duplicated elsewhere in popular music (AFAIK anyway).<br/>
<br/>
In other words, its hard to describe ...<br/>
<br/>
