What I was trying to say for those who find that their stamps have <br/>
vanished from the box is that they may want to leave a note in the <br/>
box with this message-  If you steal this letterbox stamp then the <br/>
GODS of letterboxing will make sure that your remaining days will be <br/>
left in utter turmoil and poverty. <br/>

bad <br/>

&gt; &gt; Pure and simple.  The vapor pressure of hand carved stamps causes <br/>
&gt; &gt; them to evaporate.  <br/>
