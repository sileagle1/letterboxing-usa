always useful to ask this letterboxing group about the local <br/>
letterboxes. I am ALWAYS letterboxing in a place that maybe I am not <br/>
so familiar with! You can ask the folks here at Yahoo groups to <br/>
recommend the local boxes. Which ones are "drive-bys"? which ones are <br/>
missing? Which ones are MUST SEES, MUST HAVES? It is a little too <br/>
late after the fact to complain about the hikes and the difficulty of <br/>
the clues. A little research before you go letterboxing is often <br/>
required. If Vague Clues are not your cup of tea, you should really <br/>
read the clues before you leave the house. You might email the placer <br/>
of the box and ask for some clarification. Just How long is this <br/>
hike? Where exactly is this park? If it is not a mystery box, most <br/>
folks will be happy to give you more information. <br/>
