<p>I agree with Chuck- post your stats if you want, and if you don't want, don't. Plain, simple and easy to understand. 
</p><p>It seems that this list gets into controversy about once a month. Something always comes up to spark conversation, agreement and disagreement. I remember a time not too long ago that Lizardbutt was the theme that went 'round and round. Now it's stats. Next month- who knows? Point is that we are all engaged in something that we are enjoying. If you didn't like letterboxing, you really wouldn't be reading this- would you? I've enjoyed the fact that it is an activity that my 9 year old son and I can share. The clues to the boxes are teaching points and I try to take advantage of them. He's learned some local history, visited some new places and learned new skills. His problem solving abilities are improving- mine are too. We have visited new places, met people along the way and shared one another's company in the great outdoors. Just remember we're all here to have fun.

<p>We only use the old standard PFX stats but do not care if someone wants to use some new ones. This is supposed to be fun. Let people do what they want. It doesn't hurt anything. I have posted my stats from time to time since I started. The numbers don't bother me at all. I do want to know how others are doing. Thats not competition. That's called being interested in others. Don't let anyone talk you out of being proud to find your 100th box or 1st HH. I actually look at stats of people I will never meet, but I know them by their posts. It is true that some people have a harder time because of location finding boxes. It still is done for enjoyment. Now you have to admit that someone with 1000 finds is more experienced a boxer than someone with 15. Not better, but more experienced. Be proud of whatever your stats are. Post them if you want and if you rather not, okey don't. I hope you all do choose to post your stats. I am curious on how others are doing. Thats why I read the posts. We are not in competition. Watch out, my stats are about to appear if you don't want to see them, please do not look any further. Molly don't care if you do or not.....Chuck and Molly  P51 F271 X94

Does it really matter if you <br/>have found 15 boxes or 1500? No, of course not. Some people aren't <br/>physically able to devote too much to the hobby, now-apparently a <br/>competive sport, yet enjoy it as much for the simple fact your off in <br/>the woods. <br/><br/>I admit I haven't found 100's of boxes. I only wear an LBNA numbers <br/>patch on my backpack on the off chance a person might see them and <br/>introduce themselves, not to establish some sort of hierarchy. I <br/>guess I'm just not an in-your-face kinda guy. I think like the rest <br/>of society, status and aggressiveness are leaking into the <br/>letterboxing community.<br/>I think the website volunteers are the only ones who should be <br/>allowed to brag extensively about anything! <br/><br/></tt><br/><tt>To unsubscribe: mailto:letterbox-usa-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br/>List etiquette, info, etc: <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html">http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html</a><br/></tt><br/><br/><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
