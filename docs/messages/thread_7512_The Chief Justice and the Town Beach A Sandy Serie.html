nice and there was a beautiful beach.  We found all three boxes but none of <br/>
them had ink pads.<br/>
       We also went to New London, CT to the letter box at Fort Trumbull.  <br/>
The letter box was there but the ink pad cover was broken.  <br/>
       We had a great day, found 6 letterboxes with plans to go back for <br/>
more.<br/>
