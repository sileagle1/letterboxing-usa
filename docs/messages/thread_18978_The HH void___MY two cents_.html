<br/>
Out of the 37 boxes that I've found in my one month of boxing, 4 <br/>
have been hitch hikers.  I'm also planning on starting a HH Monday <br/>
(more to come on that).  For each, I've e-mailed both the placer and <br/>
Wanda and Pete to let them know that the HH's were in good shape and <br/>
on their way to great adventures.  I have to admit to holding on to <br/>
3 of them because of an upcoming trip across the country that is <br/>
just too good of an opportunity to pass up.  Finding HH's has made <br/>
letterboxing that much more fun and responses from the placers have <br/>
been speedy and happy.  <br/>
<br/>
My only probelm is that one is contained in its own Rubbermaid <br/>
container and I am wary about finding a hiding spot big enough for <br/>
both the host box and the hitchhiker.  One of the hitchers also <br/>
didn't have any contact info in it (although we did eventually track <br/>
the person down) and needed to get a new long book or be sent home.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I think HH's are great.  I just hope people continue to <br/>
be good about maintaining and tracking them...including e-mails <br/>
between finders and placers!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>

This can be a problem.  I have seen HH tucked into hiding spots <br/>
nearby with their placements (kind of a HH clue) noted in the host <br/>
logbook.  If there is a handy spot nearby perhaps this solution would <br/>
work for you.<br/>

This might be interesting, though, as I plan to bring the HH in question on vacation with me and am probably going to place it in a totally unfamiliar place......of course, Murphy's Law usually works overtime for me.....could be a good laugh for posting!!!!<br/>
