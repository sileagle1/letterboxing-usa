as a "hitchhiker kidnapper" with a red-tounged stamp. They had written <br/>
in at least three or four host boxes in SE CT that they had taken <br/>
hitchhikers and apparently alluded to *never* returning them to <br/>
circulation. Several of us have been wondering who it was who could be <br/>
so petty and mean--but had not really elaborated on the subject in <br/>
this public forum until now. These stamps began occurring just after <br/>
the posts to this list regarding whether the "comings &amp; goings" of HH <br/>
should be discussed on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this clears a little up. The identity of the kidnapper, however, <br/>
remains a mystery.<br/>

&gt; there a big thing about being first to a box. It's nice once in a <br/>

&gt; kidnapping hitchhikers I guess I don't understand what that is all <br/>
&gt; about at all. If some one gets a hitchhiker and puts it back into <br/>
&gt; circulation good. If they look into boxes they already visited and <br/>
&gt; had already stamped, so what? No big deal. The sticking out the <br/>
&gt; tongue stamp, thats just and childish. In the immortal words of <br/>
