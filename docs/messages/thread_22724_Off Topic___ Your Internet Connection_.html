                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello Fellow Letterboxers... I have been in lurking mode for a little while<br/>
and was just sitting here looking at all the internet connections that I<br/>
could be making.... Then I though... well here is a subject that will help<br/>
all of my friends in the group.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While a lot of the other Boxers are net savvy and prob. want me to go back<br/>
to lurking I just wanted to remind everyone who has the wonderful Wireless<br/>
connections to their computers around their house to make sure they have<br/>
their WEP on to keep their little part of the networld secure. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I got on my laptop today and noticed in my wireless network connection that<br/>
there was a new network.... hmmm.... I wonder... I tried to connect...POP...<br/>
<br/>
hey... I am connected to someone else's DSL connection!!!  I can check my<br/>
e-mail... surf the net... see what is on the other guys computer... HEY!<br/>
<br/>
That means they can see ME!  Disconnect.... ok... find the signal<br/>
strength... ok... walk around the block...., 5 or 6 houses later... boom..<br/>
<br/>
there is the house that has it!  KNOCK KNOCK.... Hello,  I know you don't<br/>
know me but your internet is showing.... (HIM: What?)  ME: You are<br/>
broadcasting your network connection to the block and I just thought you<br/>
might want to know. HIM: What does that mean? ME: People can get into the<br/>
DSL connection that you pay $40 a month for and use it for free.  HIM:<br/>
<br/>
REALLY?! ME: Yep. HIM: How do I fix it! ME: Let me turn on your WEP for you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After about a half an hour he was secure and once again I was the only<br/>
network that could be logged into with my laptop.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For more information on WEP and protecting yourself from drive-by linking or<br/>
"War Driving" call a computer tech that you trust or the following site has<br/>
really useful information on how you can turn on your WEP.<br/>

<http: articleview.cfm?articleid="1489&amp;page=9" www.pcstats.com=""> &amp;page=9<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Remember, right now there are NO laws on the books that will protect you<br/>
from someone logging on and using your network connection and if you want to<br/>
share that hard earned $40... Please send some to me (Smile :)<br/>

If you can get into their computer to computer network, that's another<br/>
story. However, these usually require a specific password to access. <br/>
<br/>
Surfing the web on someone else's DSL may be sneaky but it doesn't<br/>
affect the speed of any computer on the network. I don't think that an<br/>
interloper can be detected either. If the unprotected network is a<br/>
dialup, however, service will be noticeably slowed.<br/>
<br/>
Please set me straight if I'm out to lunch on this. My pokey 56K<br/>
wireless connection has been protected since day one but I wish my<br/>
neighbor had a wireless DSL network for me to use. I would gladly chip<br/>
in.  Funhog <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Where as most "War Drivers" do just check for connections and or surf the<br/>
internet for free there are programs out there that can identify your<br/>
computer on your Wireless Network. There are cracks and hacks out there that<br/>
will look for other network traffic on the Wireless network as well as<br/>
looking for passwords and keys.  A touch of security will help you in a lot<br/>
of ways.  While I am SURE that you yourself would never think of using an<br/>
internet access point for illegal activities there are those that would.<br/>
Providing access to the public through your connection could allow someone<br/>
to "hack" into a computer system that is trying to stay secure but the trace<br/>
back will go at least to your house and cause the headache of trying to<br/>
explain why you were tapping into the private files of a software company,<br/>
Gov. facility or bank.   While I realize that these things do seem far<br/>
fetched and the possibility of someone doing this next to your home on your<br/>
connection is slim to none why even live with the possibility.  Hey. we<br/>
thought that an attack on the U.S. was far fetched to.. But it happened.<br/>
Sure WEP is not the most secure method of locking down your internet<br/>
connection but I always suggest you consult a tech you trust and have them<br/>
look over what you have or research securing your Wireless Router on the<br/>
net.  There is no totally secure network in the world and for now there<br/>
won't be for a long time but I like to think that something is better than<br/>
nothing.<br/>
