Strong to the Finish, Central Falls, RI: In place, dry, and intact.<br/>

Wandering Turtle, somewhere in MA: I tested out the clues for <br/>
Rustypuff and found them to be correct.  Box was in place, dry, and <br/>
intact.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Time Travels: Fiendish Things, Blue Hills Reservation, Milton, MA: In <br/>
place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Hancock Hill, Blue Hills Reservation, Milton, MA: In place, dry, and <br/>
intact.  In place, that is, if you follow the directions to the <br/>
letter.  Don't assume the box is on Hancock Hill.  It isn't.  We <br/>
discovered this when we tried to follow the map back to the car from <br/>
what we thought was Hancock Hill, and got lost.<br/>
<br/>
We found the above two boxes in the rain.  We got soaked, but managed <br/>
to keep the boxes and their contents dry.<br/>
<br/>
20030608<br/>
<br/>
This American Life / NPR, Boston Public Garden, Boston, MA: In place, <br/>
dry, and intact.  The Altoids tin, however, is already developing <br/>
rusty spots, so we enclosed the whole box in a ziplock bag.<br/>
<br/>
Breakheart Reservation, Breakheart Reservation, Saugus, MA: In place, <br/>
dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Kokopelli's Flute, Lynn Woods Reservation, Lynn, MA: The box was <br/>
crushed and it's contents strewn.  The log was missing, but we found <br/>
the stamp.  We stamped in on the clue sheet, left it and the stamp in <br/>
a new box, and rehid it as best we could.<br/>
<br/>
We'd like to point out that the trailhead is in the SW corner of the <br/>
parking lot (not the NW), paces = steps, and "several minutes" <br/>
translates to about a minute-and-a-half.<br/>
<br/>
Salem Witch Trials: Briget Bishop, Forest River Park, Salem, MA: The <br/>
box was open, but the contents were intact and dry.<br/>
<br/>
Marblehead Rail Trail, Wyman Woods Conservation Area, Marblehead, MA: <br/>
In place, dry, and intact.<br/>

It's good to see someone else has found this box recently , since <br/>
there have been a lot of reports of it being missing . I was <br/>
beginning to think people where doubting that we had found it back in <br/>
November . Good job ! And Chris , Thanks for the info on The Witches <br/>
Alter . Watch for a box coming soon .<br/>
