People!   Please try to keep things in perspective.  The so called<br/>
Letterboxing Lifetime Achievement Award we are giving is just a<br/>
letterbox.  I thought we were free to make any sort of letterbox we<br/>
choose - this is just the type that we have decided to put out at this<br/>
time and we doubt that anyone who knows letterboxing history should<br/>
need to quibble about OUR choice of "letterboxing heros".  If anyone<br/>
is having trouble with this concept, just think of it as a Boo Boo box<br/>
that you don't have to get hurt for in order to receive.  All you have<br/>
to do is stay involved in letterboxing for five years, be kind, and do<br/>
alot of hard work.  We thought that most people  would appreciate this<br/>
recognition, but for those who don't want any part in it that's OK<br/>
too.  Trying to diminish the meaning of this letterbox in no way<br/>
diminishes the accomplishments of these special people we admire.<br/>

More later ...<br/>

Thanks for the clarification.  I didn't realize that it was a box you<br/>
were referring to.<br/>
<br/>
That may very well clear the air around here ... let's hope so anyway.<br/>

<br/>
I just cannot be quiet on this one...<br/>
<br/>
First of all, Wanda doesn't read the list, so pretty much all discussion and<br/>
snide comments aimed at her are moot. She stopped reading the list a good<br/>
while ago since people could not seem to get along and her F count seemed to<br/>
bother people so very much. She or Pete post occasionally to let people know<br/>
about one thing or another, but otherwise she's off-list.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, there are PLENTY of boxes out there for whom clues are passed<br/>
person-to-person that require folks to have reached a certain LB<br/>
achievement, F-count or otherwise. In fact, there are a good number of<br/>
people who have stopped publicizing any of their clues because they don't<br/>
want "riff-raff" (I'm quoting here) finding them. I may not like the idea of<br/>
it....but guess what people...It's their right to plant any kind of<br/>
letterbox they want, pass the clues along however they wish or even be<br/>
exclusive.<br/>
<br/>
I just find it terribly frustrating that Wanda and Pete, two of the most<br/>
gentle, quiet, unassuming souls I've ever met, seem to be the target for so<br/>
many of these attacks. People don't want her to reveal her F count, because<br/>
it makes others feel inadequate (pardon me, but oooh poor baby). People<br/>
don't want them to question the vandalism of their boxes. Now they don't<br/>
want them to place a box honoring the long-standing and prolific boxers.<br/>
<br/>
Ya know? Let's really put it in perspective....It's a bit ironic that the<br/>
box in question is called the Oscar. Just imagine if all the actors at the<br/>
real Oscars who did not win went around griping and bad-mouthing all the<br/>
Oscar-winners or how the winners were chosen to the press. We would call<br/>
them rude and poor sports and very childish. We many not have accomplished<br/>
all that those actors have, but we let them have their day and we clap for<br/>
them. It's the same thing here.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, as this list so often shows, we are all entitled to express our<br/>
opinions...I just wish people would THINK before they post. If your goal is<br/>
to hurt feelings, stop people in their tracks, make people angry or say "so<br/>
there!" then I would suggest that you walk away from the computer for a<br/>
while before pressing that "Send" button. Reread. Ask yourself how YOU would<br/>
feel if it was sent to a public forum and YOU were the target of the<br/>
comments.<br/>
<br/>
Please, life is too short...far too short.<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>
Kim (Rustypuff)<br/>

If you want to send a postal box to a certain group of people, do that,<br/>

LRE this past spring, and even though I was in awe of the "goddess of<br/>
letterboxing", lol, I must report that I found her to be a very nice, down<br/>
to earth person. I think her idea is a fun way to recognize people who have<br/>
been instrumental in spreading the sport of letterboxing and for the rest of<br/>
us to learn about famous letterboxers in other parts of the country. For<br/>
example, it's impossible to box in Texas and not know who Baby Bear and<br/>
Silver Eagle are, but people in other parts of the country might not<br/>
recognize their names, just as we, in Texas, might not recognize the name of<br/>
someone influential in boxing in the far east or north. Each of these<br/>
influential boxers no doubt has an interesting story behind all the hard<br/>
work they've done to further the sport, and I think it would be fun if<br/>
WandaAndPete found a way include their stories in the box or log book. <br/>

anything at all. It was true when my mother taught me that and it's still<br/>
true today. It doesn't cost anything to be nice!  <br/>

That would be going on the assumption that I would think that *I* <br/>
would qualify to be held in high esteem of those who should be <br/>
honored as letterboxing pioneers.<br/>
<br/>
That would be the wrong assumption. I don't even have a clue about my <br/>
counts, nor do I have a NEED to be noticed.  I have always, however, <br/>
pointed out that many thanks is due to our letterboxing forefathers.<br/>
<br/>
However, looking only at the criteria put forth it would exclude a <br/>
great number of people who ARE letterboxing pioneers.  They would be <br/>
excluded if only for the simple fact that they aren't listed on the <br/>
Wanda and Pete's website as being members of a certain group.<br/>
<br/>
That would exclude such people as:<br/>
<br/>
Mapsurfer (Randy),  Susan and Erik Davis, Dermadstamper, Tom Cooch, <br/>
Graham Howard, Rae Record(who made my most favorite letterbox),  <br/>
Legerdemaine,Trish, Mohmers, to name just a few. If you don't <br/>
recognize these people, look in the archives and understand that many <br/>
have gone under the radar because of a lot of BS- doesn't make their <br/>
work any less worthy of recognition or thanks.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the only one I would think even comes close would be Jay <br/>
Drew.  I think Jay should be thanked for his behind the scenes work <br/>
as webmaster for a number of years and, though I sometimes cursed him <br/>
while looking, his boxes are truly a gift.<br/>
<br/>
Now, does that sound like a person who is jealous or a person who has <br/>
appreciation for those who came before?<br/>
<br/>
Again, I was told somewhere that this isn't a competition.  Numbers <br/>
don't matter.  Longevity doesn't matter. Quality of stamp doesn't <br/>
matter.  Oh and "there are no rules".<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to make any box you want- I'm not the judge on that.  But I <br/>
will stand up to those who try to judge what sort of thing deserves <br/>
an widely proclaimed award based on completely biased 'rules'.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, BTW- your analogy stinks.  Oscars are chosen by secret ballot of <br/>
those who are the best in their craft, not just the opinion of TWO <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem with the box, I have problem with the announcement <br/>
and the proclaimation as though it were sanctioned by the real <br/>
pioneers of the craft.<br/>

I'm sorry, I didn't realize I wasn't being nice? Is my opinion less <br/>

that automatically makes them not nice? I'll have to remember that.<br/>

as webmaster for a number of years and, though I sometimes cursed him<br/>
while looking, his boxes are truly a gift.<br/>
<br/>
Now, does that sound like a person who is jealous or a person who has<br/>
appreciation for those who came before?<br/>
<br/>
Again, I was told somewhere that this isn't a competition.  Numbers<br/>
don't matter.  Longevity doesn't matter. Quality of stamp doesn't<br/>
matter.  Oh and "there are no rules".<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to make any box you want- I'm not the judge on that.  But I<br/>
will stand up to those who try to judge what sort of thing deserves<br/>
an widely proclaimed award based on completely biased 'rules'.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, BTW- your analogy stinks.  Oscars are chosen by secret ballot of<br/>
those who are the best in their craft, not just the opinion of TWO<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem with the box, I have problem with the announcement<br/>
and the proclaimation as though it were sanctioned by the real<br/>
pioneers of the craft.<br/>

debate but our understanding was that this was a competition, an award. It<br/>
was never mentioned that this was a letterbox. Maybe that should help ease<br/>
some minds. It does ours. We don't need more competition in this game and<br/>
that was the entire intent of my post. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Debate has long been a feature of this talk list - from the very beginning.<br/>
We should be free to air our feelings without repercussion, just as Wanda<br/>
and Pete are free to post and plant any kind of letterbox they want.<br/>

Let's step back and consider the feelings of others and maybe end this<br/>

cents on this one.<br/>
<br/>
While I believe Wanda and Pete have every right to plant any darn box<br/>
they please..they have to be aware that their comments may cause some<br/>
grumbling. Many worthy people might be left out..but that's ok. For<br/>
instance, using their own criteria, Ryan Carpenter (Green Tortuga)<br/>
would not qualify because he has only been in this for 4 years. Yet he<br/>
has done more for letterboxers, most whom he has never met, with grace<br/>
and fairness. I wish my politicians were as responsive. Luckily, Ryan<br/>
is not the type of person who is concerned in the least whether or not<br/>
he qualifies for any Grand Poobah distinction...lol. <br/>
<br/>
But, like I said...it's THEIR criteria. I only wish if they planned to<br/>
launch such a box, they made it more clear in the beginning what their<br/>
intention was..and maybe just quietly launched the box with no fanfare<br/>
or posting. It seems to me that their critical mistake was poor<br/>
communication. A common problem in ANY activity. <br/>
<br/>
Let's keep the good vibes flowing out there and let Wanda and Pete do<br/>
what they wish. If you disagree...make your own damn box. :)<br/>

that was the entire intent of my post. <br/>

Debate has long been a feature of this talk list - from the very beginning.<br/>
We should be free to air our feelings without repercussion, just as Wanda<br/>
and Pete are free to post and plant any kind of letterbox they want.<br/>

Let's step back and consider the feelings of others and maybe end this<br/>

I hope you will join me chucklilng on the sidelines ( well, I guess I haven't stayed on the sidelines, now have I?) and consider looking past this little miscommunication moment. I'm sure we can all learn from it. Like any good family, we have to have a tempest in a teapot once in awhile! <br/>

However, her tone in the post seems to be firmly tongue-in-cheek, and I am sure it would distress her greatly to learn that she had caused offense....<br/>

Thank you so much for defending her Ladyship's honor. Your kind and<br/>
insightful remarks were most appreciated. Yes, her Ladyship's tongue<br/>
was indeed implanted in her rosy cheek but cold bare words stripped of<br/>
the inflection of her Ladyship's melodious voice seemed to have lost<br/>
their humor...as did some readers. Upon reading the reply her Ladyship<br/>
remembers saying to Bartleby, tongue still in cheek, "Oh fow Peat'th<br/>
thake." Bartleby seemed to misunderstand as well because he brought<br/>
her Ladyship four pink steaks. Perhaps her Ladyship should refrain<br/>
from attempts at the humorous bon mot.<br/>
