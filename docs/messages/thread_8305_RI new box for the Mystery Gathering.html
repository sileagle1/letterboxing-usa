</p>The year was 1622.  The Pilgrims at Plimouth Colony were flushed with their success in gaining the peace and friendship of Massasoit and the Wampanoags.  Governor Bradford, wishing to increase the security of the settlement, sought the acceptance of the great sachem Canonicus, leader of the powerful Narragansetts, to the west of Plimouth.  The Governor sent a messenger bearing gifts to the Narragansetts. However, Canonicus scorned the gifts of the Pilgrims. In return he sent to Governor Bradford a quiver of arrows wrapped in a rattlesnake skin.  Governor Bradford accepted the quiver as a token of hostility and defiance.  He emptied the quiver, refilled it with musket balls and gunpowder and sent it back to Canonicus.<br/>
    From the NW corner of Canonicus's Longhouse, take 70 steps at 70 to a juniper being choked by bittersweet.  Under the juniper some scattered rocks are the headstones for the remains of Canonicus's message.<br/>
