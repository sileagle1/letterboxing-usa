start about now and go until about Hallowe'en or so, with a few possible days<br/>

<br/>
This is my first year so I'm not sure how it's going to work over the summer. <br/>
92 degrees is too hot to 'box by bike, figured that out today.  Or at least, 92<br/>
degrees is too hot in May, when last week had highs in the 60s...<br/>
<br/>
Didn't find the box either. :(  Got my annual sunburn out of the way early,<br/>
though -- I guess that's good.<br/>

I've been letterboxing for a year this month.  I just checked my AQ logbook &amp; I've found letterboxes ever month of the past year.  My lowest count seems to have been October, and I think that was because I was busy with scouts &amp; work.  I started planting in January, and I've planted at least one box a month since!  Oh no--I just noticed the date--I must prepare something for Plant a Letterbox Day!!!<br/>

<br/>
In Southern Arizona you dont letterbox much in the summer unless they are<br/>
indoors or drivebys.<br/>
Or if you do take plenty or water, wear good sunscreen, and go out early in<br/>
the morning.<br/>
Did a two mile hike this morning (round trip) to one. I was back at the car<br/>
by 8:45 and it was already 85 degrees.<br/>
It led to a great overview of the city, peace and quiet.<br/>
<br/>
So if you can stand the heat, it never stops. My solution? Go north in the<br/>
summer.<br/>

I usually spend the spring planting Lbs and maintaining the ones that I<br/>
plant. I don't usually get to find any new ones until after memorial<br/>
day. I live in the northeast<br/>
<br/>
When do you start your season or does it ever stop?<br/>
