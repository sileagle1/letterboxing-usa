of today, the trails are still open. but that will<br/>
probably change once the rainfall really kicks in in<br/>
western washington. in preparation for that, i have<br/>
updated my cluse for the alder box. see below.<br/>

Taylor Mountain Series<br/>
<br/>
Alder Box<br/>
<br/>
Placed on October 6, 2002 by hoofandspoke<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION: Taylor Mountain County Park<br/>
<br/>
Nearest City: Hobart<br/>
County: King<br/>
State: Washington<br/>
Country: USA<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
NOTES<br/>
<br/>
I hope to have all of my boxes be accessible to<br/>
equestrians, hikers and mtn. bikers. You will need to<br/>
dismount to get to the box, btw.<br/>
<br/>
TREK AND WEATHER FACTORS<br/>
<br/>
For Summer Clues: Medium 6-7 for hiking difficulty.<br/>
Could be wet in the winter in quite a few spots. As a<br/>
horse ride, this isn't for a pansy show horse, but any<br/>
average horse who is fit should be able to negotiate<br/>
it just fine. Do not use this trailhead in the winter<br/>
if it is marked "Trails Closed." I may supply a<br/>
different set of clues for winter horseback or<br/>
mountain bike access at some point.<br/>
<br/>
For Winter Clues: Easy. Could be wet in the winter in<br/>
a handful of spots. As a horse ride, this one's not<br/>
even worth it unless you plan to explore the rest of<br/>
the trails afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Wheelchair access not available for this series,<br/>
sorry.<br/>
<br/>
RESTRICTIONS<br/>
<br/>
It's a county park, so dogs should remain on leash at<br/>
all times. Report wildlife (bear and/or cougar)<br/>
sightings to the County. Please use the Winter clues<br/>
if there are trail closures.<br/>
<br/>
TIME TO COMPLETE<br/>
<br/>
About 2.5 hours for the Summer Clues. Significantly<br/>
less for the Winter Clues. I can't really judge by<br/>
foot for humans. Please let me know and I will update<br/>
this section.<br/>
<br/>
CLUE DIFFICULTY<br/>
<br/>
Medium for Summer Clues as there is one spot at an<br/>
interesection which could be interpreted differently.<br/>
I may change that in the future. Easy for Winter Clues<br/>
is my guess.<br/>
<br/>
STAMP QUALITY<br/>
<br/>
Fair. Not carved on site, but done pretty hastily.<br/>
<br/>
SUMMER CLUES GETTING THERE<br/>
<br/>
Coming from I-90 in Issaquah, take the Front St. Exit<br/>
and head south. Go almost 9 miles. When you reach the<br/>
stoplight at SR-18 which is the on ramp to head over<br/>
Tiger Mountain to North bend, go through the light and<br/>
park in the parking area just to the left.<br/>
<br/>
Coming from the south/west (Tacoma/Federal Way/Auburn)<br/>
Take SR-18 to Hobart Exit, at the stoplight, take a<br/>
right and park in the area just to your left.<br/>
<br/>
Coming from the east (North Bend; from over Tiger<br/>
Mountain) Take SR-18 to Hobart Exit, take a left at<br/>
the stop sign onto Issaquah-Hobart Rd. Just past the<br/>
stoplight, park in the parking area on your left.<br/>
<br/>
The parking area is NOT designated with any signs.<br/>
Occasionally you will see horse trailers or other<br/>
vehicles parked here. it's a popular spot for mountain<br/>
bikers to park at as well.<br/>
<br/>
SUMMER CLUES<br/>
<br/>
Start at the County gate just south of the parking<br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
Head east on this logging road for appoximately 20<br/>
minutes as a horse would briskly walk, but not trot.<br/>
<br/>
You will see a sign for Hobart Trail off the right<br/>
hand edge of the road.<br/>
<br/>
Take this trail.<br/>
<br/>
Stay on the main trail unless otherwise directed.<br/>
<br/>
You will encounter an area of burnt logs and stumps.<br/>
Take the trail that goes DOWN from here (southish).<br/>
<br/>
After approximately 4 to 5 minutes, you will come to a<br/>
very small clearing after blue and yellow streamers.<br/>
Take the trail that goes to the right.<br/>
<br/>
After approximately 6 minutes, you will come to<br/>
another gravel access road. Take a left and head up<br/>
the hill.<br/>
<br/>
After about 6 minutes of gently winding to the north<br/>
and east, the grade starts to steepen.<br/>
<br/>
When you come to another gravel road that is marked<br/>
"Trail," follow it to the right (east).<br/>
<br/>
When you reach a pile of gravel, the road changes into<br/>
a trail. Follow the trail<br/>
<br/>
About 3:20 from the gravel pile, you will come to a<br/>
small snag/cut tree on the right edge of the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Go about 15 human paces further down the trail.<br/>
<br/>
On the right side of the trail there are rocks edging<br/>
the trail. Across from the rocks on the left side of<br/>
the trail is a cluster of 3 alder trees.<br/>
<br/>
Your treasure is in the crook of the trees under the<br/>
leaves.<br/>
<br/>
Please make sure the box is well hidden under the<br/>
leaves after you have logged in.<br/>
<br/>
Look for clues for my next box to start from Alder<br/>
Box.<br/>
<br/>
WINTER CLUES GETTING THERE<br/>
<br/>
Coming from I-90 in Issaquah, take the Front St. Exit<br/>
and head south. Go almost 9 miles. When you reach the<br/>
stoplight at SR-18 which is the on ramp to head over<br/>
Tiger Mountain to North bend, go through the light.<br/>
Just past the Hobart Market, there is a Fire Station<br/>
at S.E. 208th. Take a left here. Go approximately 1.5<br/>
to 2 miles to 298th Ave. S.E. (marked a Private Road.<br/>
Park at the gate at the end of the road, but please do<br/>
not block the residential driveways in any way.<br/>

WINTER CLUES<br/>
<br/>
Start at the County gate.<br/>
<br/>
Head north on this logging road for appoximately 12<br/>
minutes as a horse would briskly walk, but not trot.<br/>
<br/>
You will pass a sign near the bottom of the hill for<br/>
the Hobart Trail West Gate.<br/>
<br/>
Just past the trail sign, the grade starts to steepen.<br/>
<br/>
When you come to another gravel road that is marked<br/>
"Trail," follow it to the right (east).<br/>
