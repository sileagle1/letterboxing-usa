letterboxing introductory workshop . It will be held Tues July 31 at <br/>
7 p.m. in the Mansfield Hollow State Park  Picnic grove off Bassttes  <br/>
Bridge Rd. Mansfield Center. ( off Rte 195)  The rain date is Aug 3, <br/>
7 p.m. This is  a workshop on how to get started , BUT if you want to <br/>
come we would love to have you. It would be a good time to boost a X <br/>
count, and gather the  event box. I will later change that stamp so <br/>
it will be available in original form only at the workshop/ event.  <br/>
There are many boxes available in the Hollow presently , including <br/>
two which have to be  found by boating to them.  If you want to print <br/>
off clues the following boxes are in the park area : Lonesome Goose ( <br/>
water), Kayaking Box(water), Grumpy, Opening Day, Friends of <br/>
Mansfield Hollow, Troutfishing in America, Watermelon Sugar, One FIsh <br/>
Two Fish Red Fish..., Paddle to the Sea, You Otter See This,and the <br/>
new event box Sunset Trails ( forthcoming clues). Hope to See some of <br/>
you there!   Leader of the Pack<br/>
