boxers to it.  I only placed this one - at the historic site in <br/>
Seneca Falls, NY - three weeks ago, on Stanton's birthday, but the <br/>
idea had been in my mind for some time.  What to call it, that wasn't <br/>
too long, when a number of worthy women and both the locally-founded <br/>
Hall of Fame and the Women's Rights National Historic Park were <br/>
involved? Seemed to me that Mrs. Stanton deserved as much fame as <br/>
Miss Anthony, but wasn't accorded it on the national scene.  And my <br/>
guess is that a 'hall of fame' might have greater draw than 'historic <br/>
park'.  Hence the name, now reflecting this in the list of <br/>
letterboxes for Central &amp; Western New York.<br/>
If you haven't been to Seneca Falls to pay homage to the seminal <br/>
activities of 150 years ago, you owe it to yourself.  Well, yes there <br/>
may already be snow cover there, but it's less likely than at many <br/>
other 'snow-belt' areas of NY.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know, I grew up in Bloomfield on the other side of Canandaigua. Though I<br/>
live in VA now. In my misspent youth I tried ever so hard to find Seneca<br/>
Falls. (I was kind of stalking a boy) I used every map available to me, and<br/>
never made it to that town. So, I came home last year confident that if I<br/>
can drive up from VA, I can definitely make it to Seneca Falls to see  the<br/>
hall of fame, and lo and behold, can't find the town AGAIN! I'm now quite<br/>
sure that much like Atlantis, Seneca Falls is a myth, and everyone claiming<br/>
to know it or of it is just tugging my leg, lol! Maybe next year for our<br/>
annual pilgrimage to NY. You can give me directions to find your town, so I<br/>
can hunt your boxes! lol!<br/>
