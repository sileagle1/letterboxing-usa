have a solution. As I've posted several times my mom, friend, fiance,<br/>
and I have beautiful patches we got ours very large, but you can get<br/>
them smaller. They do not display the LBNA logo. (It took my mom about 6<br/>
months to figure out what it ment anyway.) I'm hoping to get a digital<br/>
camera for my birthday at the end of the month so that I can take<br/>
pictures and show you what they look like. We got ours done with silver<br/>
and gold trim to show 25 and 50 letterboxes. But the shop will do what<br/>
every you want. Also they'll embroider directly on your favorite<br/>
garmnent (or anything you want). We decided to do patches so that we can<br/>
sew them onto our blazer oranges. (now we need to get some for our dog<br/>
miss Molly. Her orange looks plain.)<br/>
