Does anybody know if the Bishop's Close letterbox is still there?  Spent a <br/>

I was there a couple of times &amp; missed the spot.  There are only a couple of<br/>
places it could be (paying attention to the clues).  I was able to identify<br/>
the Box-Leafed Honeysuckle.  I will most likely be there tomorrow, so I'll<br/>
let you know how I do.... third time is hopefully the charm!<br/>

It is a tiny box, so it would be easy to overlook...don't get too  <br/>
over zealous rooting around in the foliage!!<br/>
