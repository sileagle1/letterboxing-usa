<br/>
Some of you may know me as a letterboxer and some of you may know me <br/>
as the mother of a blind letterboxer (Outofsight) and the grandmother <br/>
of a letterboxer in training (Milkmonster). Recently, I have been <br/>
forced to put my letterboxing way, way back on my list of priorities <br/>
as the needs of my family have increased. My daughter and grandson <br/>
are the main priorities on my life and I have been focusing on <br/>
spending as much time with them as possible and I will do anything to <br/>
make their lives easier. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, my daughter lost her sight 8 years ago from <br/>
diabetes. She was an EMT before that time and her husband is a <br/>
paramedic and a fireman. My son in law works two full time jobs to <br/>
make ends meet for their little family since Laura no longer works <br/>
outside the home. She did go back to school to learn how to be a <br/>
massage therapist and does have a few clients that she treats <br/>
regularly. She had learned to use a computer before she lost her <br/>
sight and was retrained on it after she became blind. The computer is <br/>
her main means of finding out anything she needs to know since she <br/>
can't read a newspaper or book or a box or can as most of us would. <br/>
But now her computer died.<br/>
<br/>
I found a contest to win a new computer but I am looking for votes to <br/>
help her win. You can read a lot about my daughter and grandson on my <br/>
blog at http://milkmonstersmimser.blogspot.com/ but what I am asking, <br/>
really, I am begging, is for votes for her to win the computer at <br/>
http://www.needatechmakeover.com/2008/09/janila-needs-a-tech-makeover-<br/>
because/ If you could go to that website and click on the <br/>
words "liked it" and add a comment if you choose, I would appreciate <br/>
it greatly. A new computer would be the world to my daughter.<br/>
Thanks so much for any help,<br/>

You can't vote more than once from a computer but you can vote on <br/>
other computers.  It doesn't seem to track WHO is actually doing the <br/>
