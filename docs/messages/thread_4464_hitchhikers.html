Boy, you can say that again. I remember when<br/>
hitchhikers were few and far between and a delightful<br/>
surprise to find. After finding 4 of them<br/>
consecutively of late, it seems that everybody and<br/>
their brother wants to float one out there and then<br/>
blab to the whole letterboxing community where it is,<br/>
or at least the general area. Must one REALLY<br/>
advertise it's general whereabouts? "I, uh, planted<br/>
another hitchhiker in the southern half of somewhere,<br/>
but there's a gazilllion boxes around there so you'll<br/>
really have to look for it..."<br/>
<br/>
Why say anything at all? I don't get it. Wouldn't it<br/>
be nice to plant a hitchhiker (maybe ONE, perhaps) and<br/>
then keep your mouth shut and let it make people<br/>
happy?<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead, slam away.<br/>

life of their own.  They go places you don't.  It is fun to think of where it <br/>
will turn up next.  <br/>
       I have not planted any hitchhikers myself but if the secrecy of HH is <br/>
being compromised by web postings, I have 2 suggestions:  1) when you get <br/>
your mail, delete any postings with HH in the subject line if it offends you <br/>
and 2) include an e-mail address in the HH book.  That way finders can update <br/>
planters without broadcasting it to the LB community at large.<br/>

<br/>
I only have 2 hitchhikers out but I have never been lucky enough to <br/>
find one of my hitchhikers in someone elses box.  I have found a <br/>
total of 6 hitchhikers in 6 months.  I seem to find 1 about every <br/>
month or so which is nice.  Although I have never heard any protocol <br/>
covering finding your own hitchhiker, since I make my letterboxes for <br/>
other people to find I think I would stamp in, read the log book, and <br/>
leave my hitchhiker where it is so others could find it.<br/>

though - reading the logs of various boxes in Northern Virginia, I <br/>

I'll have to weigh in with my opinion after I've got a few more <br/>

one.<br/>

A hitchhiker is a traveling stamp - it doesn't have<br/>
its own box, but is created and placed (along with its<br/>
own log) in another box.  When someone finds a box<br/>
with a hitchhiker in it, they take the hitchhiker and<br/>
its log with them and later drop it in another box. <br/>
The hitchhiker moves from box to box in this way.<br/>
<br/>
When someone finds a HH, they stamp into its log book<br/>
and stamp its stamp into their own.  I like to note in<br/>
my own logbook that it is a hitchhiker, when and where<br/>
I found it, and when and where I dropped it off again.<br/>
 It's courteous to contact the creator and let them<br/>
know that you found the hitchhiker and what you did<br/>
with it.<br/>

I have a hitchhiker with me right now that is going to<br/>
find a new home this weekend in the Heart of Texas!<br/>

people stamped into, but no one had taken.  I felt a little sorry for it, so<br/>
picked it up and moved it on.  Emailed the planter, but never heard back...<br/>

HH's sit for as long as they're still out there.<br/>

It's really neat to look thru the logbook to see where it started and where it has been.  On the LBNA website, before it went down, I logged our finds there about the HHs.  2 of them are listed there, and last weekend we found our 3rd, but with the site down, I can't see if it's listed on there. <br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">First, I think it's a request made by the placer but I don't personally feel<br/>
that it's actually puts any obligation on a finder.  A lot of finders don't<br/>
contact the placer to report problems with boxes either.  It would be nice,<br/>
certainly, but folks aren't obligated.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of variables that can figure in.  If a finder is searching<br/>
for more than one box that day, they might not be taking the HH home with<br/>
them, but rather, leaving it in another box that day, and they might forget<br/>
to jot down the email addy of the placer.  Or the HH's logbook might have<br/>
gotten wet and the placer's email addy isn't legible.  Some folks I'm sure<br/>
always *intend* to contact the HH owner but time just gets away from them.<br/>
Some folks might find an HH but just not want to give out their email addy,<br/>
which the HH owner is going to have if the finder contacts them -- part of<br/>
the secrecy that some boxers like.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, the HH *could* be languishing in a box somewhere for a year.  Some<br/>
boxes get *much* less traffic than others.  There are also a lot of people<br/>
that don't care much about HHs and don't take them to move them on.  There<br/>
have been times when time has been short for me and I've found a box with a<br/>
HH in it and I didn't even open the HH bag up.  I stamped the box's logbook,<br/>
sealed everything back up, and went on my way.  By the time I made the hike,<br/>
figured out the clues, and found the box, there just wasn't all that much<br/>
time left.<br/>
<br/>
It could also be languishing in somebody's backpack for a year.  Someone<br/>
might have picked it up and lost interest in boxing before they sent the HH<br/>
on it's way.  Or it could be in the bottom of a backpack someplace and the<br/>
person hasn't cleaned out their backpack in a long time to even realize they<br/>
still have it.  (Maybe letterboxers should have a semi-annual "Clean Out<br/>
Your Backpack Day.")  I see notes all the time in HH logbooks saying things<br/>
like "Sorry I kept this so long, family things came up."  Stuff like that.<br/>
Or it's possible that someone could be carrying it around a long time<br/>
because, as boxes get smaller and smaller, it can be difficult at times to<br/>
find a box large enough to include the HH.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing, and this is just my own personal opinion, but there seem<br/>
sometimes to be just too many HHs out there nowadays.  They're not as<br/>
"special" as they once were when a finder comes across them.  Maybe some<br/>
areas are much more saturated than others, but I'd say that around 50% of<br/>
the time this year that I've found a letterbox, I've also found a HH.  It's<br/>
just not as exciting as it used to be.   Finding a HH no longer gives me<br/>
that little "rush" that I got when I only came across one maybe once every<br/>
20 or 30 boxes or so.<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like hitchhikers suffer the same kinds of vagaries as mail art projects.  Mail artists and pen pallers send hundreds of things round-robin through the mail.  They go missing all the time.  "someguy" from 1000Journals released a thousand blank books, and years later only two have made it home; many have gone AWOL and some are still floating around, about ten times slower than everyone thinks they should.<br/>
<br/>
I plant journals on airplanes.  People always ask me, "Do you get them back?"  Well, I hope to get them back, but I don't expect to get them back.  It's not because people are mean or dishonest or anything.  The phenomenon is so widespread throughout the mail art community--and so many good mail artists have admitted to losing track of or forgetting about or otherwise disrupting a project--that I can only think that it's quite normal for things to go missing, and quite exceptional for them to proceed as intended. There are so many variables in people's lives, in the process, that it really takes a daydreamer (like me) to even try. For me, that has meant that I have to be willing to let things go, to let what happens, happen.  It's all part of the experiment in the end.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd think basic courtesy would suggest that a thanks would be in order if someone notifies the placer of a hitchhiker.  The person who found it owes the placer nothing--there is no obligation to follow the instructions simply because the hitchhiker happened to be in the box the finder visited with aj open request to the entire universe to notify the placer.  No need to comply.  But the finder went out of his or her way to let the placer know the hitchhiker had been sighted.  Normally when someone goes out of his or her way for someone else, thanks would be in order.  <br/>
<br/>
Nobody likes to work in a vacuum.  <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't consider thanks a given, either, because there are quite a few boors in the world (though the word has fallen out of favor).  But I'd consider anyone who didn't offer even a brief thank you for the trouble of recording their email, the state of the hitchhiker, the new location if any, etc, and then remembering to follow up and actually send an email--well, the request to notify the placer is a fairly significant one, and not to thank someone for fulfilling it is boorish.<br/>
<br/>
I've received email regarding my airplane journals, and I can't imagine not acknowledging them.  Someone found the book, wrote down my email, kept track of it through an airport and a drive home or to a hotel, remembered to pull it out the next time they were on the net, and spent a couple of minutes of their time letting me know.  I consider that a huge favor.  If I could afford it I'd send them dinner vouchers!  Thanks is all I can offer...I wouldn't dream of withholding it.<br/>

&gt; I'd think basic courtesy would suggest that a<br/>
&gt; thanks would be in order if someone notifies the<br/>
&gt; placer of a hitchhiker. The person who found it<br/>
&gt; owes the placer nothing--there is no obligation<br/>
&gt; to follow the instructions simply because the<br/>
&gt; hitchhiker happened to be in the box the finder<br/>
&gt; visited with aj open request to the entire universe<br/>
&gt; to notify the placer. No need to comply. But the<br/>
&gt; finder went out of his or her way to let the placer<br/>
&gt; know the hitchhiker had been sighted. Normally when<br/>
&gt; someone goes out of his or her way for someone else,<br/>
&gt; thanks would be in order.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
When planting a letterbox, a placer has gone out of their way for <br/>
other participants of the game, they have given their time and <br/>
creativity to the hobby -- they have in essence given a gift, a gift <br/>
to be freely enjoyed by anyone who participates in the hobby of <br/>
letterboxing. While receipt of a gift does not ever "obligate" one <br/>
to express thanks, most would agree that common courtesy suggests <br/>
that thanks might be in order. So while there is nothing <br/>
that "obligates" the finder of a hitchhiker to follow a placer's<br/>
request -- just as there is nothing that "obligates" a finder to be<br/>
discreet, repackage the box contents or even to move a hitchhiker<br/>
along to a new box -- it is a letterboxing courtesy to follow a<br/>
placer's requests. Contacting a placer after finding a box or a<br/>
hitchhiker, while not required, is showing appreciation to that<br/>
person for the effort they put into creating and placing the box.<br/>
After all, were there not those who created letterboxes, there would<br/>
be no game for others to enjoy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'd consider anyone who didn't offer even a brief<br/>
&gt; thank you for the trouble of recording their email,<br/>
&gt; the state of the hitchhiker, the new location if any,<br/>
&gt; etc, and then remembering to follow up and actually<br/>
&gt; send an email--well, the request to notify the placer<br/>
&gt; is a fairly significant one, and not to thank someone<br/>
&gt; for fulfilling it is boorish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
And in the context of letterboxing I would consider a person who<br/>
found a letterbox or a hitchhiker -- a box that had been lovingly<br/>
created by another individual, often involving a hand-carved stamp<br/>
and sometimes even a hand-made logbook, and then set it loose for no<br/>
other reason than to provide enjoyment to others -- but didn't have<br/>
enough respect or gratitude to acquiesce the placer by sending a<br/>
note of appreciation for creating and placing the box so they are<br/>
able to play this game in the first place, to be quite boorish also.<br/>
<br/>
When I find a letterbox or a hitchhiker, knowing and having great<br/>
respect for the effort that went into placing that letterbox, I<br/>
generally try to send a note to the placer to thank them for placing<br/>
the box which provided me with an enjoyable hike, perhaps introduced<br/>
me to a new location or provided me with a snapshot of the history<br/>
of a place or person. I do not have an expectation that the placer<br/>
will then thank me for my thank you. Although I certainly<br/>
appreciate it so that I can be confident my e-mail was received by<br/>
them, I do not consider them a bore if they do not keep the<br/>
correspondance alive by responding to my note of appreciation.<br/>
<br/>
Just goes to show there are different perspectives on everything.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funhog, I was responding to something specific.  No spoof.  It's a considerable amount of trouble to take down an email address, keep track of it and what HH it belonged to, and remember to make contact, so while it is good etiquette, it really isn't an absolute obligation.  Most of us would do it though--else why would we be playing this game?  But if it's good etiquette for someone to go to all that trouble, it's hard to believe that--as was said in the post to which I was responding--similar good etiquette doesn't include a response from the placer--a simple thanks and acknowledgement of the finder's email.  This is a multi-player game.  The placer doesn't really place the HH or the box just for the enjoyment of strangers--she expects to get some personal pleasure out of it (regardless of what some may claim).  She wants to hear it's been visited/spotted, she's showing off her artwork, she's adventuring vicariously through it.  If we placed them without hope of ever hearing another thing, many would not bother to play.  And the finder who goes to the trouble of reporting the find (particularly of a HH), to assume that the finder is obligated to report the HH because the placer requested it, but that the transaction is completed once that is done with no obligation on the part of the placer to thank the finder, seems absurd to me.<br/>

Boy...there sure is a different feel between letterboxing and geocaching.  Letterboxing appeals to me much more for it's artistic history and the creativity it still retains, but the two communities feel entirely different.<br/>

(In my opinion) But in geocaching the ultimate goal is to log in your find. Very few geocacher omit this part. The owner of the box gets a log of the find. Reading the logs becomes a way of helping to find difficult hides, some contain vague hints.  In letterboxing, it seems to me that the real goal is to stamp our journal. period. Unless you are tracking your finds on line nothing else really seems necessary or important. The upkeep and availability of a box should be up to the planter. Yes it does help the person who has planted many boxes to keep track of their availability and it helps others to know it is still there. But I have been told that it is the hunt and not the find that is important (gag). Hitchhiker therefore fall in the same category.  All the game "rules" seem to come down to how would you like it to be handled if it was your box or hitchhiker and that is what each individual should use as a guide for themselves. <br/>

I do not however feel I have been slighted if I do not hear back from a placer after I have contacted them to say thanks for the letterbox and the wonderful time I had looking for it.  I really feel this part of the communication is an individual decision.  I also regret the logging feature at LbNA for this reason as I see far fewer contact the placer messages and more folks that have just logged a status (to which I very rarely send a follow-up unless I have a specific question about a box).<br/>
<br/>
I cannot however agree with a person who has the attitude that contacting the placer of a HH (or a LB) is a bother and there is no need to comply with a placer's request in this regard.<br/>

But, to each his own.<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes an email comes in when I'm overwhelmed and I think, I'll get<br/>
back to them later.  But then I don't.  <br/>
<br/>
However, it is through this kind of dialog that I've made great<br/>
letterboxing compadres.  I want to encourage new planters and finders<br/>
in my area.<br/>
<br/>
And now, in another true confession, I have a little secret: <br/>
sometimes I don't take the HH!  Lotsa reasons:  I'm not sure when<br/>
we'll be back out, I don't want to fool with the stamping required, I<br/>
have two already sitting in my pack, whatever, sometimes I just leave<br/>
it for the next finder.  So remember, if notifying the placer seems<br/>
like a hassle to you, just leave it in the box for the next finder. <br/>
