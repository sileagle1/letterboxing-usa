a couple of new mapsurfer boxes, 1 in Ohio, and 1 in Virginia.<br/>
I'm especially pleased with my stamp for the Ohio box.<br/>
<br/>
The Virginia box is in Lee County, and the map can be found at:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box4.html<br/>
<br/>
Clues for the Ohio box will come later this week.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, welcome to "Stamperhog".  I will be putting up a "hiding tips"<br/>
web page later in the week (hopefully) that may give you some ideas<br/>
on some of the questions you had. (Also, I have verified first hand<br/>
that the Max Patch box is in fact in the state of North Carolina ;-))<br/>
<br/>
Also, as someone who as been to Greenland, I'm curious to see where that<br/>
Greenland box ends up ...<br/>

<br/>
Its listed under TN, because that is where the clue starts.  I normally <br/>
wouldn't have mentioned it was actually in NC, because it seems like bad<br/>
ettiquette to discuss solutions of other people's clues on the list,<br/>
but in this case it has been discussed before along time ago, and we are <br/>
just getting started in NC, and people are talking about the y2k thing and<br/>
the like, and it just sort of seemed well-known that it was in NC. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Does this mean that letterboxes  exist that are NOT mentioned on that page???<br/>
<br/>
There are indeed, apparently, although I personally have never physically<br/>
found one yet.  I am told of a story of someone finding one by accident for<br/>
which a clue has never been published anywere, though.  I have seen mention<br/>
of several boxes out there for which I have never been privy to the clues.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So how does one go about finding OTHER boxes that are not listed here????<br/>
<br/>
I think that is just another aspect of the game.  Sorry to be so cryptic,<br/>
but I don't think there is a really good answer to that one.  I understand<br/>
there are people who have chosen not to publish their clues on the 'net,<br/>
sometimes a box will contain a clue to another box, etc.  Also, do not<br/>
discount the possibility of clues being published, but it not being <br/>
obvious that its a clue.  For example, a normal post to the list may <br/>
contain a clue for the clever to see, or a web page may just be sitting<br/>
out there with a clue waiting to be discovered.  I'm not sure there is <br/>
alot of this going on in the 'States, but as it matures, and more people<br/>
come on board, I think finding the clues in the first place will definately<br/>
become part of the game.<br/>

How come this box doesn;t show up on the map at the LetterboxUSA web page???<br/>
Does this mean that letterboxes  exist that are NOT mentioned on that page???<br/>
"Cause I must admit, I was VERY surprised that there were so few boxes<br/>
"planted" when I first saw the page. IF there are others, that makes me smile.<br/>
So how does one go about finding OTHER boxes that are not listed here????<br/>

Thanks for telling me this. I had discounted the one in Tenn. as it seemed<br/>
"too far away" so I would not have made an effort for it to be my first one.<br/>
But NOW&gt;......... somehow it seems a little closer, Thanks again. I plan to<br/>
"plant"one myself in the very near future in the Greensboro area.<br/>

This brings me to something I had been thinking about but was waiting to bring up.  As our maps are currently set up, you only see the clues in each individual state, but not the neighboring states.  How difficult would it be to also show the bullets for clues in neighboring states that are close to the state line (e.g. the NJ "Minsi" clue would show up on the PA map, and vice versa, same w/ NC, TN, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I'm not trying to create more work here, but this would help newbies get a better feel for how clues are scattered when you get near state lines.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

Well, I know &amp; love maps, but don't know much, or anything, about the Tiger server (other than it's from the Census Bureau), but I would love the opportunity to get involved in this aspect.<br/>
<br/>
let me know if I can be of assistance.  I'd love to learn more about it and to have the opportunity to contribute to the group effort in this way. <br/>

Well, these are good questions.  The answer is yes, what you're asking<br/>

terms.  It may be a long while before it materializes.  But thank you<br/>
