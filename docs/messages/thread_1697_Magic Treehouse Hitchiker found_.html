and we found the "Magic Treehouse Hitchiker" at the 3rd box  "Ledyard<br/>
Oak"! We were also "found" by Valerie and Vic as we were trying to look<br/>
nonchalant sitting there, red (or 'green' handed), so we shared the find<br/>
and exchanged stamps as we went on our way and they went off in search<br/>
of the other boxes. The hitchiker had been left there on 12/28 by Dan<br/>
and Melissa (thanks!). FYI, we also found the "Grinning Ninny" box in<br/>
Hamden yesterday.  What a lovely weekend to get out in the woods! Happy<br/>
New Year everyone! Annie B (the compass) and Evelyn (the sunshine) aka<br/>
1/2 of the "Elements of Hiking" (in snowy letterbox packed woods CT)<br/>
