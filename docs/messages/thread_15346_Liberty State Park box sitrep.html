had to say also, as I was a bit thrown by previous comments regarding <br/>
location because they didn't coincide with where I would have been <br/>
looking.  I do have a couple of questions, but will e-mail those <br/>
offlist.<br/>
<br/>
Will be in the area later this week and am hoping to find it!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">So sorry to have misattributed this box as lost - naturally, it is somewhat difficult to <br/>
contact the placer by email when no owner is listed on the box's page.  As I recall, <br/>
there was no means of contact from the old site either.  <br/>
<br/>
I had one of the best and most experienced minds in letterboxing with me (Amanda <br/>
from Seattle) and we (obviously) managed to get horribly turned around, so I agree <br/>
that this is a particularly tricky spot to find.   Kimberly, I will contact you off list to ask <br/>
about a couple of the details in the clues since I don't want to give anything away.  <br/>
<br/>
Culpably yours,<br/>
