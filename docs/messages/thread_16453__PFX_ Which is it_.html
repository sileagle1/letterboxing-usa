                    <div class="plaintext-content">The time has come to think about PFX again. Not in terms of numbers - oh no, I'm <br/>
not in it for the numbers, this time it's about the meaning. The 'P' of course means <br/>
that you took the time and consideration for other fellow boxers and placed a box. <br/>
The clues are crafted, caution thrown to the wind and they are released. <br/>
<br/>
The 'F' is of course practically our favorite in that we get to find those wondrous <br/>
treasures. This is the culmination of efforts, the arch d' triomphe if you will that <br/>
results in a higher count. It can be justified that you have conquered these boxes <br/>
and moved on.  You can only find once, you can plant once, you can't plant and <br/>
then find your box no matter how many times you *really* go and check on it. <br/>
<br/>
The 'X' results in a much greater overall ratio in proportion to the frequency of 'F's <br/>
and contingent upon the number of 'P's. It's a nice little equation really, it works out <br/>
well - but when it becomes unbalanced, then the numbers are off. <br/>
<br/>
Here's a great example:<br/>
"character A  began boxing y #/mo. ago and has x # of 100boxes"<br/>
The ratio of time boxing (measured in #/mo) to quantity found is quite simply <br/>
unbalanced. It indicates a serious stoichiometric problem.<br/>
<br/>
But, dare I ask what happens when you are a lonley 'P'? How does one know such a <br/>
thing.  Do you spend countless hours considering the placement of a box in <br/>
relation to the other boxes around your area? Do you forge ahead and plant that <br/>
box not thinking at all? Inspiration or motivation?  Numbers or letters? <br/>
<br/>
What is the driving force?<br/>
<br/>
Simply, all 'F' and no 'P' results in no fun and games in the long run. Likewise, it <br/>
seems like an unhealthy relationship between the reciprocal if you are all 'P' and no <br/>
'F'.  Never fear, take heart and adopt a box for the greater good. Start out small and <br/>
work up to it, those little gems are orphaned and need some TLC regardless of your <br/>
PFX.  Next time you're out on the trail - consider the area and perhaps it might <br/>
need some TLC as well to boost your PFX.  <br/>
<br/>
All those reluctant to place a box - go for it<br/>
All those reluctant to find a box (ha!)  - clap<br/>
<br/>
mighty quiet round here<br/>

&gt; The time has come to think about PFX again.<br/>
<br/>
You know, when I was first turned on to letterboxing, I was at my <br/>
summer home in RI.  There were SCADS of them everywhere.  When I <br/>
returned to my permanent home in Central MA that fall, I was dismayed <br/>
to find that there was on ONE (Bonsai) anywhere in the general <br/>
vicinity where I lived.  I planted at least 5 letterboxes between <br/>
September and November 2001.<br/>
<br/>
And WOW! did they get a lot of traffic.  I have had to replace the <br/>
log book at least three of them within a year.  This set off a flurry <br/>
of box placements by other boxers by 2002.<br/>
<br/>
You know the saying "It only takes a spark to get the fire glowing".<br/>
<br/>
So to add to your note:<br/>
<br/>
Plant them and they will come ....<br/>
