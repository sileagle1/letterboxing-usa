&gt; Sorry you're having trouble with the Stampeaze site. I just checked<br/>
&gt; and was able to get in without trouble.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; April is great, as far as customer service goes.  You could've<br/>
&gt; knocked over with a feather when the mailman showed up with my<br/>
&gt; package the day after I PayPal paid for it!<br/>
&gt; Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Darn, maybe the server was down?  I just clicked on the link &amp; it<br/>
