snow!  I went letterboxing in the snow last year in Watkins park.  <br/>
After an hour of looking I finally found the log under several inches <br/>

location wasn't so good either.<br/>
<br/>
There must be some that are ok in the snow in MD.  You Marylanders?<br/>
<br/>
There are a few indoor letterboxes in the area.  My "It's a Holiday" <br/>
in Arlington, VA is one.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>

Now try it when there's been a temperature drop long enough to freeze<br/>
the snow into ice.  I had to retrieve 'Sinking Pond' (Western NY) with<br/>
a screwdriver from car repair kit.  Now I carry an ice-pick in winter<br/>
months. :D<br/>
