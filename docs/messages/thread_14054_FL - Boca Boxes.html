to do a little letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Snowflakes are Falling in Florida.  The box is there but it was a <br/>
little tricky starting the search.  The first clues call for parking <br/>
in the campground parking lot by sites 1-4 and taking the paved path <br/>
past sites 1-3.  We circled around a bit and finally figured out that <br/>
ALL THE SITE NUMBERS HAVE CHANGED!!! Plus, if there are campers at <br/>
the sites, you can't park there.   Sue - you can revise your clues as <br/>
follows:  To get to the letterbox, drive to the camping area.  Park <br/>
either at the Mountain Bike parking area or at the ranger station and <br/>
walk through the campground gate.  Take the paved trail on the right <br/>
through the woods...<br/>
<br/>
2.  Went to look for Florida Friends at Patch Reef Park.  I'm sorry <br/>
to report that this box is gone.  I found the saw palmetto and the <br/>
piece of tree stump that used to cover the box, but the box is gone.  <br/>
I'm not the only one who came up empty on this one.  I was following <br/>
a week behind Ann from Hollywood FL and she wrote a note in the logs <br/>
for Tiki Idol and Loggerhead that she couldn't find the Patch Reef <br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Tiki Idol.  It was an adventure in itself finding George Snow <br/>
Park but find it I did and duly found the Tiki Idol.  Glad to see my <br/>
regional neighbors Celtic Pride and D and Shoo had also visited this <br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Loggerhead.  This stamp is fantastic!  There haven't been too <br/>
many visitors, probably because you have to do a little research to <br/>
figure out the name of the park.  Pete and Wanda were there in <br/>
December and left Waterbird's TSA Voyager hitchhiker.  The next <br/>
person there was Ann from Hollywood, FL in late June.  She stamped <br/>
into the HH but left it.  So I brought it back to Virginia where it <br/>
started.  So this HH had a 6 month stay in FL during VA's horrible <br/>
winter and now has made it back in time to escape FL's brutal summer.<br/>
I encourage everyone who is visiting the Boca Raton area to look for <br/>
this box.  To make it even more worth your while, I planted another <br/>
box in the same park.  Clues to follow!<br/>
