You cannot view the clues online (as far as I can tell), but you can order<br/>
the book from their web site for about 10 bucks.  I have done this and found<br/>
some of the boxes -- it only took about 3 days or so for it to arrive, so I<br/>
would recommend doing this.<br/>

I had the same experience as you did with the pdf stuff.  I tried different<br/>
versions, etc.  I guess that's what I meant by the clues being inaccessable.<br/>
I generally do not like to deal with pdf and Acrobat stuff in the first<br/>
place, because its usually somewhat of a hassle in some way, so I just<br/>
decided it was easier to order the book than fight with it.<br/>

Greetings letterboxers, <br/>
<br/>
My wife and I bought the Valley Quest book this summer on vacation in <br/>
Vermont, and we went nuts going on these wonderful quests.  The Norwich <br/>
Vermont Quest blew me away, as did the Quechee Quest.  With 54 quests in all, <br/>
its well worth purchasing.  And I can't think of a better excuse to visit <br/>
Vermont than Valley Quest, when the leaves will be bursting in colors. <br/>
<br/>
Happy Questing,<br/>

	If you haven't yet gone to the ValleyQuest web site (from LBNA home<br/>
page, click on VT or NH, and then the ValleyQuest marker right in the<br/>
center of the map), you really owe it to yourselves to check this out. I<br/>
know there was some brief mention of this a while back - today was the<br/>
first close look I had.<br/>
<br/>
	I think this represents a wonderfull model for letterboxers - bringing<br/>
community discovery and education to kids of all ages. What better way<br/>
as well to grow this hobby!<br/>

However, this is the text from their page - I guess I'll ask them what<br/>
is supposed to come up.<br/>

&gt; Below you will find descriptions of all the Quests in the current Valley Quest Book of Maps listed alphabetically by town.<br/>
&gt; Click on the Town to view its Locator Map, a map showing you how to get to the town and the starting point of each Quest.<br/>
&gt; Click on the name of the Quest to view the actual Quest map. NOTE: These maps are PDF files. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I applaud the efforts of the many folks who have been involved<br/>
with this - 52 letterboxes is QUITE dramatic!<br/>

Very close, John - all of them are within an hour's drive from the <br/>

I just sent a query to Ed Bourne about our November gathering, and <br/>
dangled the prospect of 60-some boxes within an hour. Was about to <br/>
send you one too. I do hope you're still planning on coming. Please <br/>
let me know ... and make your reservations at the Inn<br/>

No problem getting the details of our get-together to you. I do <br/>
really hope you and Eric can make it. Our firm (i.e. already reserved <br/>
at the Inn) folks right now are my family, Erik Davis &amp; family, John <br/>
De Wolf, and Bonnie - but I believe we will have several more people <br/>
as well, possibly quite a crowd.<br/>
<br/>
What I am going to do is forward you copies of past missives, and <br/>
then you can let me know if they miss key questions.<br/>

<div>Hello fellow Letterboxers,</div>
<div>    We just came 
back from a fabulous weekend of camping and letterboxing in Vermont.  We 
brought our great little book of maps and clues made by the school children of 
the Upper Valley  and spent the weekend searching for 
"quests".  If anyone is in the area we would highly recommend 
picking up a Valley Quest book in one of the local stores.  We walked all 
around Woodstock and Quechee learing about the history of the towns and hiking 
some great little mountains.  (Mount Tom and Mount Peg)  Also took a 
kayak trip down the Connecticut River to seach for a box, unfortunately that box 
was no longer there, but we did find an awesome riverside camp 
site!</div>
<div>    According to the 
Valley Quest book, there is a similar program in the Monadnock Region of New 
Hampshire.  If anyone knows how we could get a book of clues please let us 
know.  We will be up at Mount Monadnock around the Fourth of July and would 
love to find some more boxes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>                        
Happy Letterboxing,</div>

Did you find the one on Mount Peg?  I think the consensus last year<br/>
was that it had gone missing but no one could be sure.  In any case,<br/>
its such a nice hike, and hopefully you found the box up there too ...<br/>

I'm going to call up to the school district and see if I can track <br/>

Not to my knowledge, but the books are available at most any bookstore<br/>
in the Valley Quest area.  Or if one is passing by Grantham, NH they<br/>
can borrow my copy for the day...<br/>

Hi There,<br/>
I just got this magazine (my first). I also read this article. It appears<br/>
that this program, though identical to letterboxing, is a completely<br/>
different program. The people that designed this are part of Valley Quest. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The current issue of Old Schoolhouse magazine (www.thehomeschoolmagazine,<br/>
&gt; though the article is not online) has a story about letterboxing. I wanted<br/>
&gt; to mention, in case they are on this list, that the stamps featured from<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Vermont History Quest series, as well as the other stamps, are all very<br/>
well<br/>
&gt; done. Oddly enough, the article never once mentions LBNA, refering<br/>

<br/>
While they may not mention the LBNA, Steve and Simon are very much interested in letterboxing and the LBNA and keep abreast of what's going on. Frequent visitors to our website, they have always have great things to say about letterboxers in their emails. <br/>
<br/>
If I have my facts correct, I believe Valley Quests pre-date letterboxing.<br/>
