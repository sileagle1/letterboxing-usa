We're not upstate and we're not western or Mid Atlantic. Many of us live<br/>
in or near an urban area. If you live in one of the five boroughs of New<br/>
York City, or Westchester, Rockland, Suffolk, Orange, Nassau, or Putnam<br/>
County, this will be a small, private group for those who love<br/>
letterboxing and want to perhaps meet and greet other boxers nearby for<br/>
exchanges or boxing in this area or others. Maybe you are looking for<br/>
boxing buddies? Maybe you just want to talk about your favorite hobby?<br/>
Join us.<br/>
<br/>
HAVE A JOYOUS HOLIDAY!<br/>
