We also had a great time--as we have had at the other events. It's <br/>
always great to see those we've met before (always stories to swap) <br/>
and it amazes me every time all the new faces as well. We especially <br/>
liked hiking with the group who ventured out of the warmth, and had a <br/>
blast in the bathroom while it was crowded (you had to be there <br/>
<wink>).<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks too to the gift-shop lady for allowing Erin to keep her <br/>
company.<br/>
