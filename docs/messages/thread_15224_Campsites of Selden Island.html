get their new stamps!  What a great series and hard boxes to get to!  The <br/>
island is fairly rugged outside of the campsites, which makes getting to the <br/>
boxes harder, but not difficult.  This is not your average "take this trail" <br/>
search!  We had loads of fun and had a nice mini picnic afterwards, thanks to Wanda <br/>
who brought some munchies for the event!  Hitchhikers were broken out, and we <br/>
stamped away!<br/>
<br/>
A very special THANK YOU to Sunshine and SY for helping us get out to the <br/>
island!  I had a great time and it was nice to get out on the water again (I <br/>
haven't been ALL YEAR.. sigh)!<br/>
