beautiful day for a hike! Coincidentally, the local newspaper had a story <br/>
about beautiful trails to visit and THIS was one of them so there were MANY <br/>
people on this well-manicured, native plant-infested trail. (Mimulus, you'd love <br/>
it!) <br/>
<br/>
We were so inspired, we planted 2 boxes ourselves: one about 3 miles from <br/>
this one and one about 12 miles west, near Davis. So take a trip up and enjoy <br/>
them all!<br/>
