                    <div class="plaintext-content">This has been a great week for letterboxing - other than the <br/>
outrageous amount of mosquitos and ticks...  Here's an update on <br/>
some CT boxes:<br/>
North Windham Station - Perfectly intact - Chuck does such a great <br/>
job putting boxes together!  Trails are very wet though.  Lots of <br/>
hitchhikers had been there, but none for us!  :(<br/>
You Otter See This - Intact, but very difficult to find.  At least <br/>
we found it on the first try, unlike several others had noted in the <br/>
logbook.<br/>
Paddle to the Sea - Intact, but difficult to find (two trails on the <br/>
right....so many pine trees....so many stumps....)<br/>
Fab Four - Got the first 3 stamps back in October, but was getting <br/>
too dark for the others.  Got George and Ringo this time.  Ringo's <br/>
box was wet inside, but the logbook and stamp were okay within the <br/>
baggy.<br/>
Zoom Zoom Zoom - Intact.  The first log book had been filled and <br/>
someone had added a second.  Is this box supposed to be in full-view <br/>
like that?<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has found the "And Then There Were Three" box, please <br/>
email me privately at meadow77lark@yahoo.com so I can ask you a <br/>
question.  We were pretty sure we were in the right location, but <br/>
didn't find it...<br/>
