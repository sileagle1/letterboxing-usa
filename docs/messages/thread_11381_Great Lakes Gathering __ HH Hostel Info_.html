**First**<br/>
<br/>
I need a good count and e-mail address of people planning (or <br/>
tentatively planning) to attend the gathering at Waterloo State Park, <br/>
MI on May 31.  I have gotten sporadic e-mails from people over the <br/>
past couple of months, some definitely coming, others expressing <br/>
interest depending on location, etc.  I would like to put together an <br/>
e-mail list for those who want to receive information as the date of <br/>
the gathering gets nearer.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know who you are, where you are from and how many <br/>
people in your party will be attending.  Also, please note your <br/>
possible interest in the workshops (Ruthann Zarhoff will be doing a <br/>
stamp carving workshop and I will be doing a workshop on <br/>
crafty/creative log books).  The workshops will not be simultaneous <br/>
so if you would like to attend both, that's fine (do you think I <br/>
would miss Ruthann's stamp carving workshop?).  There may be a small <br/>
charge for materials for the workshops -- details will be forthcoming.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**Michigan HH Hostel Details**<br/>
<br/>
I've created a Michigan HH Hostel Letterbox, similar in concept to <br/>
those placed in PA, CT and RI, to be permanently placed at Waterloo <br/>
State Park.  The box contains 1 permanent box stamp and has room for <br/>
3 HH stamps/log books.  When someone finds the box, they exchange a <br/>
HH they have with them for one of the HH's in the box.  If you are <br/>
planning to attend the gathering, you are welcome to contribute a <br/>
HH.  I would need to have it mailed to me by May 8, to allow time to <br/>
get boxes placed and clues written.  If there are more than 3 people <br/>
who express an interest, 3 will be included in the hostel and the <br/>
others will be randomly placed into the "Visit Michigan" letterboxes <br/>
that will be hidden at the event.  There is not a specific size for <br/>
the stamps as I didn't end up going with a compartmented box, but <br/>
please try to keep your stamps and logbooks compact so they can <br/>
easily fit into the boxes.  If you are planning to attend the <br/>
gathering and are interested in contributing a HH, please let me know <br/>
via e-mail.<br/>

<br/>
I am planning on attending, but being that I have a little Letterboxer in<br/>
the oven, I may not be able to make it when the time comes. Gotta love<br/>
nature! However, one way or the other, I would love to contribute a HH and<br/>
maybe a letterbox to the gathering. Of course, if I can help in any other<br/>
way please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for doing the planning for MI's first Letterboxing extravaganza!<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
