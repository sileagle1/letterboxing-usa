<br/>
My girl friend and I are relatively new to this sport/pastime.  I have a<br/>
very extensive mapping and orienteering background in the eastern United<br/>
states.  I grew up in Bucks County, PA and know the parks and trials like<br/>
the back of my hand.  As a leterboxing hunter for about a year now (hunting<br/>
mostly PA, NJ and DE boxes)<br/>
I have made some observations as to clues and directions and box placing<br/>
that would help make the sport more enjoyable, and not as frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
Please realize that the environment changes and trails change sometimes over<br/>
night, They can be reblazed and re-routed so if you place a box in an area<br/>
you either need to re-visit the box to see if the clues still fit the local<br/>
or give one or two backup clues of solid landmarks, directions or headings<br/>
to help the "would-be" box hunter re-adjust their assumptions.  If not, you<br/>
may have hikers off trail in places they shouldn't be, chasing an assumption<br/>
not a fact.  Try to use good landmarks (Monuments, Historical sites, Old<br/>
trees, Large rocks...if it looks like it's been there forever it probably<br/>
has, and will be for a long time.) as well as headings, paces and direction.<br/>
<br/>
Just this weekend we were in Tyler state park seeking a box.  The placement<br/>
of the box was near a body of water (river) and on trails that are<br/>
frequented by horses and bikes.   --Here is a double whammy.  When placing a<br/>
box near a river you have to take into account the flood plane... and that<br/>
in a big storm (like the one we in that park had last mouth) could flood the<br/>
area (9'under).  Water and debris from down stream can accumulate and make<br/>
the box un-retrievable.  Also horse and bike trails change very frequently.<br/>
Some riders choose to go around obstacles in the trail and create new trails<br/>
parallel to the old one.  Since a horse is large and heavy and in wearing<br/>
some kind shoe the trails get cut very quickly.  One or two horses more and<br/>
you have a new fork head.  So if you navigate your clues with trail heads or<br/>
T's or forks, it can be quite confusing of you do not back it up with a real<br/>
landmark.  Try to avoid stumps for It is likely to be removed as it<br/>
deteriorates.  There's a box at Pea Patch Island that uses a tree stump as a<br/>
landmark.  It was removed.  Though frustrated we eventually found the box.<br/>
<br/>
There's a box near Hopewell furnace (we were the first to find) that uses<br/>
Trees and Trails sometimes as lone landmarks...the trails are for biking and<br/>
hiking so the heads and especially the T in the clue was re-forged into an<br/>
intersection, since there was no other CLEAR clue or landmark this led us on<br/>
a 3mi un-necessary hike. We found the box, after a full day of hiking and<br/>
re-hiking and re-guessing, and moving our car(due to the lot closing)...,<br/>
but we were VERY FRUSTRATED.<br/>
<br/>
Avoid using GPS for your clues, it is very unlikely that the average hunter<br/>
has this type of device.  It is likely that they're armed with a $12.00<br/>
compass from REI so If you do use GPS check out the heading with a cheap<br/>
Silva and note the variation in your clue.  Even using GPS and<br/>
survey-mapping the course before setting out can still be. (usually pacing<br/>
is about + or - 10% - compass headings + or - 5% to 8%)  even if you factor<br/>
this into the clue you still should be + or - 10% to 12% off in your clue.<br/>
<br/>
It's funny but the box's that have been placed in problem areas, with vague<br/>
clues and landmarks seem to be the ones that have no stamps in them.  It's<br/>
not an ego trip here folks, be smart, have fun....you may learn something<br/>
about the environment around us and just how precious and ever-changing it<br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting<br/>

<div>Very, very well put, 
especially for all the "new" letterboxers out there and even us "old" ones. 
We can learn from your comments. You have made some valid observations (I 
can tell you have spent plenty of time in the woods) about the box clues 
and their physical relationship to the woods they hide in. Just today I found 3 
of 4 mystery boxes. I looked for 30 minutes for the 1st before I gave up. 
To many "fallen trees that looks like caterpillars". Number 2, 3 and 4 were 
based on solid, physical land marks, bridges, rocks, chimney, etc. I also added 
a box to the same mystery area. I always "try" to use landmarks like you 
mentioned. This time a solid 4x4 trail marked and a compass 
bearing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you for your insight and 
recommendations.</div>

&gt; Very, very well put, especially for all the "new" letterboxers out there and<br/>
&gt; even us "old" ones. We can learn from your comments. <br/>
<br/>
True, especially for certain styles of letterbox clues.  There is<br/>
much wisdom in that post.  <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, for other styles, specific, obvious landmark detail and <br/>
redundancy would compromise the challenge that the hunters of these <br/>
sorts of boxes are attracted to.  Not everyone is attracted to these<br/>
sorts of boxes.  Armchair treasure hunters are used to having to deal<br/>
with the fingerprints of towns, trails, roads, and other features, and <br/>
extracting subtlety from vague clues, and realise that things change <br/>
over time.  I will be revisiting the disclaimer on my web page that <br/>
says my boxes are hard and not for the easily disappointed.  All of my<br/>
clues are listed with date planted so that those who are aware of the<br/>
way things change can factor that in.  It is important to be aware that<br/>
things can change.  The only constants are contour detail, large rocks, <br/>
and some streams and other water features.<br/>
<br/>
I'd call them "treasureboxes" if the term "letterbox" conjures up <br/>
some image of the way things ought to be, to avoid confusion or <br/>
having people be frustrated.  If most of you feel my letterboxes <br/>
don't fit the mold, as it were, its fine with me if the webmasters <br/>
don't link to them.<br/>
<br/>
Just as the popularity of geocaching _has_ proven (at least to me),<br/>
that GPS coordinates make acceptable clues for these sorts of things,<br/>
we may want to be open to _all_ sorts of clues, and ignore the ones we <br/>
don't like.  I don't like geocaches in general so I ignore them.  <br/>
But they are still fair game for those who do enjoy them.  This is just<br/>
one example.  There is no (IMHO) "right" way to write a letterbox <br/>
clue -- the hider does not owe the hunter a fun hunt, as there are <br/>
too many hunters and you cannot write something that will please <br/>
everyone.  For my part, I will never intentionally write a clue that <br/>
knowingly involves trespass, hazards, has errors, or is intentionally <br/>
frustrating or unsolvable, but "hard" and "subtle" seem in the spirit <br/>
of treasure hunting to me.  I will say, that based on off-list <br/>
comments, that I believe you missed a key part of one of the boxes you<br/>
have alluded to that lead to a longer than expected hike.  Moderate <br/>
to difficult clues can often be easily misinterpreted.  I've done <br/>
it myself too many times to count.  I was at the park last week, and<br/>
the terrain has not changed from when I wrote that clue.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; It's funny but the box's that have been placed in problem areas,<br/>
&gt; with vague clues and landmarks seem to be the ones that have no <br/>
&gt; stamps in them.<br/>
<br/>
I would actually expect this to be the case.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, good, solid advice, but I don't think one-size-fits-all <br/>
advice.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting and good luck :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

Yes, your one size fits ALL reply to my observations seems to be true...<br/>
However, you can hide your "treasure-box" on your own land.  Then you can<br/>
deal with people trampling all over YOUR yard, YOUR home, YOUR garden,<br/>
etc... (sorry got off on the wrong foot here...LOL)<br/>
<br/>
In an effort to make your point... you totally missed mine!  That is:  These<br/>
Lands, Parks and Preserves, that we hide box's in, are here for everyone<br/>
(ALL)!  So, I am sorry to say, but , in my opinion, you need to consider<br/>
that the majority of the visitors to these places aren't hunting the<br/>
letterbox there.  To have people chasing vague clues, destroying grass,<br/>
plant-life, animal den's, moss, turning over rocks, &amp; digging in some vain<br/>
effort to find a box is just silly.<br/>
<br/>
Not all letter-boxer's (including myself) have the expert skills and cunning<br/>
to solve difficult clues...(but we all like to think we can, so we try.<br/>
That's human nature)... so, the disclaimer you claim absolves you from<br/>
responsibility, (in my opinion) does not.<br/>
<br/>
The "hunt" is not why I enjoy letterboxing.  To me it's just an excuse to<br/>
see a park or a Forrest or a historical place I never knew about, and<br/>
hopefully be surprised by it's beauty, and maybe learn some things too.  I'm<br/>
glad you've sent us to such wonderful places.  I love your clues and<br/>
stories.  I just don't agree with your  reasoning here.  (that's my opinion)<br/>
<br/>
My only assertion is that we all can be responsible... Have fun, learn,<br/>
protect and see nature at it's best.<br/>
(that's all I have to say about that)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Richard<br/>
<br/>
BTW: I got the subtlety about the bikers the first time...it still didn't<br/>
help (LOL)<br/>

Perhaps you missed it, but we are on a one post per "debate"<br/>
limit.  You stated your peace earlier, and I responded to it :-)<br/>
<br/>
(Or does this rule only apply to the points that Randy Hall and<br/>
Eric Mings wish to make on this list :-))<br/>
<br/>
It obviously does not apply to the zillions of posts made <br/>
promoting a particular letterboxing web site, which, though <br/>
they did not interest me, I chose to "let go".<br/>
<br/>
It obviously does not apply to the zillions of off-topic posts<br/>
related to "bear guard", which, though important to hikers and<br/>
others in bear country, don't interest me on this list as more <br/>
authoritative and scientifically valid information is available <br/>
elsewhere.  Where is my credit for "letting that go"? :-)<br/>
<br/>
It obviously does not apply to the zillions of hiking-related <br/>
posts of "what is in my pack"?  I am a trail runner, not a hiker,<br/>
so while that information may be of interest to hikers, trail <br/>
runners who hunt letterboxes dress and equip themselves as <br/>
trail runners, and get the information of how to do so from <br/>
the appropriate places, not letterboxing talk lists, and the <br/>
"what is in my pack" thread holds no interest to such <br/>
letterboxers, though I chose to "let it go".<br/>
<br/>
Turns out I happen to believe in open discussion and debate<br/>
if the connection with letterboxing is traceable, even if it <br/>
does not interest everyone, so these threads did not bother me<br/>
in the least.  But if we want to have different rules, _everyone_<br/>
should follow them -- a variance is not granted for those who <br/>
wish to debate the value of -- or whine about the letterboxes I <br/>
have placed in more than one post.<br/>
<br/>
Now, just on principle, I'm going to hammer my point on <br/>
letterboxing/environment, because I refuse to be bound to a one<br/>
post limit on a topic that interests me --<br/>
<br/>
"It doesn't matter whether or not you think your activities are<br/>
hurting the environment.  It doesn't matter whether or not you<br/>
think it is littering.  Most everyone on this list agrees with<br/>
you.  It matters what the outside thinks, particularly editorial <br/>
writers and park people."<br/>
<br/>
There, I'm satisfied.  Flame me for breaking the rule :-) and better<br/>
yet put me in your kill file ...<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I am burnt out on people whining about my letterboxes.  <br/>
I place them freely for people to enjoy if they _choose_ to.  I<br/>
am sorry that people are not enjoying them.  On July 30th, they<br/>
will be pulled from my web site -- if you ever feel you will wish<br/>
to hunt them, print out a copy now.  The clues, including any new <br/>
ones I write, will remain available off-line to those who know <br/>
how to get them.  Note that they will be cached in google for a <br/>
little longer, but reproducing them elsewhere is a copyright <br/>
violation (its a copyright violation on google also, but that is<br/>
another kettle of fish altogether). <br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm sure I'll be accused of being childish for doing this <br/>
from some other quarters :-)  You just cannot win.  Turns out that <br/>
I do not have the skill, talent, or interest to write the clues <br/>
that people are demanding, its that simple.  There are plenty of <br/>
other letterbox clues that are different from mine.   As I am <br/>
giving to the end of the month for those with the interest, it <br/>
demonstrates that it is not a childish move.  I've been considering it<br/>
for quite some time.  (I guess calling them something other than <br/>
letterboxes did not work, what if I called them "writing samples" <br/>
would that have worked? :-))<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I've found over 100 letterboxes, including one with 6 distinct<br/>
errors in the clues, and failed to find about 30 others.  I have<br/>
never whined about a single one.  Woo Hoo :-)<br/>
<br/>
Susan wrote the other day:<br/>
&gt; Never be afraid to air your opinion or make a contribution - all we <br/>
&gt; ask is a spirit of curiosity, contribution and politeness.<br/>
<br/>
Did my posts on letterboxing/environment violate this ethic, or does <br/>
this ethic not apply to Randy Hall and Eric Mings?<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, I have politely stated my peace on _this_ thread :-)<br/>

for quite some time.  (I guess calling them something other than <br/>
letterboxes did not work, what if I called them "writing samples" <br/>
would that have worked? :-))<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I've found over 100 letterboxes, including one with 6 distinct<br/>
errors in the clues, and failed to find about 30 others.  I have<br/>
never whined about a single one.  Woo Hoo :-)<br/>

Did my posts on letterboxing/environment violate this ethic, or does <br/>
this ethic not apply to Randy Hall and Eric Mings?<br/>

Oh well, I have politely stated my peace on _this_ thread :-)<br/>

<div>I guess you can't win...I'm whining that you are withdrawing 
your clues. Are you also withdrawing your participation in this community? If so 
we as a community have not properly respected you in some way, and I am sorry. 
Your contributions have usually been evenhanded and insightful. For sure, your 
boxes are often quite challenging, and you made it clear to me - the first

I agree, boredom setting in, Mapsurfer clues scribbled<br/>
with notes, self-posed questions "could this be<br/>
here...?, these boxes are in essence the very core of<br/>
letterbox mysteries, they are what all mystery boxes<br/>
want to grow up to be!<br/>

the<br/>

that<br/>
&gt; things can change.  The only constants are contour detail, large <br/>
rocks, <br/>
&gt; and some streams and other water features.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd call them "treasureboxes" if the term "letterbox" conjures up <br/>
&gt; some image of the way things ought to be, to avoid confusion or <br/>
&gt; having people be frustrated.  If most of you feel my letterboxes <br/>
&gt; don't fit the mold, as it were, its fine with me if the webmasters <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just as the popularity of geocaching _has_ proven (at least to me),<br/>

things,<br/>
&gt; we may want to be open to _all_ sorts of clues, and ignore the ones <br/>
we <br/>

&gt; But they are still fair game for those who do enjoy them.  This is <br/>
just<br/>
&gt; one example.  There is no (IMHO) "right" way to write a letterbox <br/>
&gt; clue -- the hider does not owe the hunter a fun hunt, as there are <br/>
&gt; too many hunters and you cannot write something that will please <br/>
&gt; everyone.  For my part, I will never intentionally write a clue <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; knowingly involves trespass, hazards, has errors, or is <br/>
intentionally <br/>
&gt; frustrating or unsolvable, but "hard" and "subtle" seem in the <br/>
spirit <br/>
&gt; of treasure hunting to me.  I will say, that based on off-list <br/>
&gt; comments, that I believe you missed a key part of one of the boxes <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; have alluded to that lead to a longer than expected hike.  Moderate <br/>
&gt; to difficult clues can often be easily misinterpreted.  I've done <br/>
&gt; it myself too many times to count.  I was at the park last week, and<br/>
&gt; the terrain has not changed from when I wrote that clue.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It's funny but the box's that have been placed in problem areas,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would actually expect this to be the case.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Again, good, solid advice, but I don't think one-size-fits-all <br/>

I choose not to intermix Geocache clues with Letterbox clues.<br/>
I believe they are separate activities.<br/>
The fact that this group exists on the internet, is proof that all <br/>
here have access to it's many information sources.<br/>
I have found that if I look hard enough, I can find enough <br/>
information about where I intend to go before setting out, provided <br/>
the clues contain recognized names and locations. I also think <br/>
getting there is part of the fun.<br/>
Since we write 'clues' does that not make this a puzzle?<br/>

Hey, Rick. Gosh are you on a ROLL!!!<br/>
I think you can do your clues any way that works for you: I noticed <br/>
the coordinates to the recent parking area clue and thought it was <br/>
just fine. The challenge of finding the things is part of the <br/>
challenge!<br/>
