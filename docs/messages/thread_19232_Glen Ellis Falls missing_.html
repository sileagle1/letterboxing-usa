<br/>
Phyto, Nautilus, Culex and I looked for that box last <br/>
summer, with the exact same results. Since then, this <br/>
question has been asked several times on the list, <br/>
with no one reporting a find. I am becoming more and <br/>
more certain that the box is missing. <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone emailed the placer? Normally it wouldn't <br/>
bother me, but the mosses that are growing on that <br/>
boulder can't poossible be benefitting from the traffic <br/>
and the poking and prodding of letterboxers looking for <br/>
their prize, so if the box is not there, we should stop <br/>
sending people up there!<br/>
<br/>
If the placer is not responding, how do we go about <br/>
getting this box removed from the LBNA site?? <br/>

"Thank you for your message.  We recently discovered that the <br/>
letterbox had been removed by someone and are putting a new one <br/>
together to be placed somewhere near the last one but perhaps better <br/>
hidden.  It's very disappointing when someone steals a letterbox <br/>
despite the notice to leave it for others to find.<br/>
<br/>
You were in the exact right place and I apologize for the theft.  <br/>
Glad to hear you enjoyed the falls."<br/>
