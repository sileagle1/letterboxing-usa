I found four out of the five, all in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't find the Slug one... I'm sure I was in the right place, <br/>
but there was a creepy person watching me (in my running gear &amp; <br/>
carrying pepper spray, I must look like a drug dealer -- LOL!) so I <br/>
gave up and will try another day. I followed the directions, and had <br/>
seen in the archives for this list that someone had moved it, so <br/>
tried to follow those directions... but it was impossible to do all <br/>
that without drawing further attention to myself... It was raining, <br/>
windy, and very very cold out today -- why on earth were so many <br/>
people at the park? We're expecting snow, for goodness' sakes. (: <br/>
Myself, I'm hoping for 2-3 feet of snow, but I'll be lucky if we get <br/>
two or three flakes, period.<br/>
<br/>
It was raining when I started, but had stopped by the time I found <br/>
the first box, Clover. I found the next one, Stump, in short order <br/>
and then went to the Vashon Ferry box that Amanda planted. I am a big <br/>
dope and looked all around in the bushes for the box... (: I did find <br/>
it, after I had looked directly at it six times... Those video boxes <br/>
are perfect and everything in both of them was totally dry.<br/>
<br/>
The Clover &amp; Stump boxes were also mostly dry, I dumped some water <br/>
out of Clover, but everything inside the bags was fine.<br/>
<br/>
The last one I found, near the baseball field, I had to do my <br/>
stamping at a picnic table, but merely looked like I was unpacking a <br/>
very elaborate lunch. (:<br/>
<br/>
I had a wonderful time out there, and I am totally inspired now... (: <br/>
I'm going to Discovery Park tomorrow to find the letter box there &amp; <br/>
do the loop trail twice for my run, and I plan to leave a few <br/>
letterboxes behind... I'll send the details when I've got'em. (:<br/>
