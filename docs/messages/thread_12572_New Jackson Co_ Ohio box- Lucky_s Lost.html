Lucky's Lost<br/>
<br/>
Can you find Lucky?  Lucky is a cute little pooch who wandered off in <br/>
search of a bone near an old Jackson county "hot spot."  Now he's <br/>
lost (or is he hiding?) and is waiting for someone to come and find <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Start your search for Lucky at the Buckeye Furnace State Memorial.  <br/>
To get there, take State Route #32 to the intersection near Wellston <br/>
where State Route #124 separates from State Route #32.  Take State <br/>
Route #124 east about 4 miles and look for the brown and white sign <br/>
pointing to the Buckeye Furnace State Memorial 3 miles down Buckeye <br/>
Furnace Road.  Follow the signs to the memorial.  (If you look <br/>
carefully, you may see a beaver or two in the wetland along the road <br/>
to the furnace!)  Drive past the furnace and park at the picnic area <br/>
across the road from the company office/store.  Go to the barbecue <br/>
grill.  Take a bearing of 212 and walk 6 paces (1 pace = 2 steps).  <br/>
You should find yourself by a large tree with four trunks.  You <br/>
should find Lucky hiding in a little hollow under the tree under some <br/>
leaves.<br/>
