reply have been in order? <br/>
<br/>
Second, I don't think nudity is allowed in Massachusetts state parks <br/>
and reservations, though perhaps I am wrong about that.<br/>
<br/>
Third, I have run into skinny dippers hanging out in the buff at <br/>
waterfalls in other remote spots.  They don't stare you down, for one <br/>
thing, or stand in the middle of hiking trails flaunting their nudity. <br/>
They hang out on rocks near the water, minding their own business.  <br/>
And, as I said in my original post, there was very little water to <br/>
"dip" into, as the river is nearly dry.<br/>
<br/>
And lastly, wouldn't the presence of other cars at the trailhead have <br/>
alerted this man that there were other hikers about, who most likely <br/>
would not expect nor appreciate seeing him naked?<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to frolic about naked in nature, let him or her do it <br/>
on his or her own private property and not on public hiking trails.<br/>

I have not had this type of experience either, but believe the best thing to do is turn on your heel and get out of there.  This person obviously wanted attention since he didn't  leave when he saw you.  Who knows what his motives were, maybe innocent, maybe not.  I am a firm believer in not hiking alone.  I have missed many opportunities to letterbox due to this, but I have been safe.  Be alert out there.<br/>
<br/>
And buy that whistle!<br/>

Thank you Bonnie,
<br/>for stepping up and sharing what must have been a heartstopping, hackle
goosebump, pit churning experience.  Your personal radar appears to
be working quite well!  So many things in life turn on a micro-edge
and the gods smiled upon you today.  The whistle sounds like a good
idea since you will likely be in areas where someone could hear it. 
I suggest that because your radar just got a massive tune-up that your
safety on the trails is probably greater than before this incident. 
Being aware of things around you is a tricky thing when our senses just
want to relax and tune into beautiful natural settings.
<br/><b>We are only victims if we allow events to negatively change us</b>.
</p><p>My thoughts are with you this evening,

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Susan, and thanks for your words!  Yes, I do think I was lucky that <br/>
my "personal radar" was working well yesterday.  I was busy reading <br/>
the clue for the second Bear's Den box, following the trail, and <br/>
considering if the tree up ahead might be the fallen one I was looking <br/>
for.  But then something told me to turn around and look back, and <br/>
then I saw the guy.  What if I hadn't had that "feeling" that I <br/>
wasn't alone?<br/>
<br/>
What gives me the creeps is that only moments before I had been <br/>
sitting off trail at the stone wall, happily stamping in to Bear's Den <br/>
#1.  It's quite likely that guy was watching me the whole time and <br/>
therefore knows about the letterbox.  Which has my name in it, <br/>
unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
The thought has also crossed my mind that such a person--who wants to <br/>
stalk lone hikers in remote areas--could even be a subscriber to this <br/>
email list.  <br/>
<br/>
This reservation is only a couple of minutes from Route 2, a major <br/>
highway going from western Mass to Boston.  So an attacker could be <br/>
quite far away very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'm getting too paranoid here!  But there are parks and forests <br/>
that are well traveled and visited--and then there are the remote <br/>
ones, like this one in New Salem.  I think we should all be careful <br/>
about where we go when letterboxing alone. Maybe it's best to stick to <br/>
larger parks that have rangers.<br/>

whether it is from creeps or from creepers (roots in the trail).  Like<br/>
everything in life, the danger must be balanced with the reward....or<br/>
we would sit in front of the TV all day and night....(and that is a<br/>
danger as well....humming all those ridiculous theme songs:-))))) <br/>
Good luck..<br/>

Dear Bonnie,<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry you had such a scary experience, but it sounds like your <br/>
instincts were sharp and you handled it well.  I think I would have <br/>
been tempted to wait at the trailhead in my locked car to see if the <br/>
guy returned to a car so I could get his license # and report him.  <br/>
Is there a Park authority you can report the incident to?  Eventhough <br/>
it doesn't make your fear go away, it's helpful in case others have <br/>
reported similar experiences.<br/>
<br/>
I do most of my hiking/letterboxing alone, or with several small <br/>
kids, which at times feels even more vulnerable than alone.  I <br/>
believe we're no safer from the whackos of the world at our desks at <br/>
work 100 stories in the air or alone on a trail.  It's important to <br/>
trust your instincts and walk, or run, away from anything that <br/>
doesn't feel just right. Although that's never a guarantee, I prefer <br/>
to go it alone when the alternative is not going.<br/>
<br/>
I've driven away from shops when entering would mean walking down an <br/>
isolated street or through a dark lot, just as I've driven away from <br/>
trailheads when it doesn't feel right. <br/>
<br/>
Just be careful and have lots more fun letterboxing!<br/>

Howver, I now carry pepperspray in my hand just in case it is <br/>
needed.  It can be very rewarding to be in nature alone, as long as <br/>
you stay alert for all animals, especially, the human kind!!!<br/>

<div><br/></div><tt>Hi Bonnie,<br/><br/>I have not had this type of experience 
  either, but believe the best thing to do is turn on your heel and get out of 
  there.  This person obviously wanted attention since he didn't  
  leave when he saw you.  Who knows what his motives were, maybe innocent, 
  maybe not.  I am a firm believer in not hiking alone.  I have missed 
  many opportunities to letterbox due to this, but I have been safe.  Be 
  alert out there.<br/><br/>And buy that whistle!<br/>Kit<br/><br/>Bonnie Sennott

  Bear's Den #1 box in New Salem, Mass.  It was a<br/>&gt;pleasant setting, 
  very peaceful, and after I stamped in and returned to the<br/>&gt;trail to 
  search for Bear's Den box #2, I suddenly felt I was not alone--a<br/>&gt;very 
  creepy feeling. I turned around and saw a naked man further back on<br/>&gt;the 
  trail.  Now, I know I was not the only person at 
  this<br/>&gt;reservation--there were two bicycles and two cars parked at the 
  trailhead.<br/>&gt;I stopped in my tracks to see what he would do and he just 
  stood there,<br/>&gt;looking my way but not advancing.  So I started 
  yelling "Help! There's a<br/>&gt;naked man at the river!"  A fewsecond 
  later I saw him, now carrying blue<br/>&gt;pants, sprinting uphill into the 
  woods (where, I suddenly realized, he<br/>&gt;could have a nice view down onto 
  the trail and watch anyone hiking along<br/>&gt;the river). I doubt very much 
  that he was merely skinny dipping, since the<br/>&gt;river was practically 
  dry.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Since nobody returned my calls for help, I decided I'd 
  better get out of<br/>&gt;there. I have never felt so completely alone and 
  vulnerable. How I wished<br/>&gt;the trail wasn't so rocky, hilly, and full of 
  tree roots--you can only go<br/>&gt;so fast on that kind of terrain!  I 
  also wished I had purchased the whistle<br/>&gt;I've been meaning to get. 
   <br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I've been letterboxing since its very beginnings, often 
  alone, and this is<br/>&gt;the first bad experience I have had. I know Jay Drew 
  recently posted a<br/>&gt;message urging hikers/letterboxers not to go out 
  alone.  At the moment, I<br/>&gt;don't know what to think.  I have a 
  very strong Thoreauish streak in me--I<br/>&gt;love to get away and hike alone. 
   I hate to think I can't go to beautiful<br/>&gt;places like this by 
  myself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I also hate the thought that some of the boxes I have 
  hidden might lead<br/>&gt;people into a bad situation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Has 
  anyone else had this kind of experience?  What did you 
  do?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Bonnie<br/>&gt;in cricket-and-firefly

  Trustees of the Reservation sign, which you<br/>&gt;describe as "only a couple 
  of fragments"  has been replaced.  There's a<br/>&gt;brand-new sign 
  and it's very easy to spot.  Your directions were excellent,<br/>&gt;and 
  the stamp is absolutely beautiful.  <br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As usual, I'm a little late here with my response - since I'm almost <br/>
always out walking instead of sitting in front of a computer screen!-<br/>
but I did want to say that probably the best advice I've ever gotten <br/>
regarding all my solo hiking and adventuring (over 20,000 miles of <br/>
solo long-distance backpacking in the 1980's, and some 50,000 miles <br/>
of solo hiking overall!), was to stand my ground and not show fear.  <br/>
I know that probably sounds easier said than done, and you might find <br/>
yourself shaking afterwards, but it has worked for me in situations <br/>
ranging from being stalked in the Pacific Cascades by a man who <br/>
thought he was a grizzly bear, to almost being attacked in the Mojave <br/>
Desert by a man who claimed to be Satan Himself! Coming across the <br/>
occasional naked man on the Appalachian Trail has been rather mild by <br/>
comparison - just ask him to put his clothes on and move along - <br/>
unless, of course, it happens to be the annual specially designated<br/>
"clothing optional" AT hiking day that I have heard tales of in <br/>
recent years ( probably best to simply avoid the trail on that day!)<br/>
Anyway, instead of panicking or running, which may evoke a "chase" <br/>
response, a firm stand  usually seems to work best against all but <br/>
the most vicious, aggressive, or psychotic of the bunch, and with <br/>
those types - like my MOTHER! - you wouldn't have a chance anyway! <br/>
Now, not to make light of anything, but THAT is the sort of insanity <br/>
that one should REALLY wish to never have to come up against!!!<br/>
Best wishes and keep on hiking!<br/>
