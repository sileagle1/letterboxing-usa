Greetings -- out boxing today, working on our F and P ness, placed <br/>
two boxes, found "indian in the cupboard" (a parasite seemed to <br/>
beckon us, but illuded us or was 'offed' by a N'oxer who'd recently <br/>
penned their way into the log book but left the box in a strangly <br/>
open area - we rehid as best we could).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, on our descent from the slippery mouth of the cave, just as <br/>
dusk descended, I spied a bit of rubber lilting up from the leaf <br/>
litter near my foot.  A snowflake stamp, professionally mounted and <br/>
carved, store bought but sore from it's time in the woods, without <br/>
it's varnished finish and looking rather lonely at the bottom of this <br/>
cliff face... <br/>
<br/>
Anyone missing a snowflake??? it seems rather afraid and lonely!! <br/>
email us please if it's your long lost stamp!!!  poor thing nearly <br/>
melted in this august heat.  We've rescued it (may put it in our <br/>
freezer a bit to make it feel at home *j/k).  If no-one claims it, we <br/>
will release it as a 'Snowflake seeking long lost owner' H.H. ??!?<br/>
