                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to report, as the clues were not linked to an owner, that <br/>
Haley Farm State Park (Groton) is missing it's #2 (picnic) stamp.  <br/>
The box was intact, along with logbook &amp; pencil; AND <br/>
some "crayons"!!  A few previous entries in logbook appear to have <br/>
been geocachers, thus explaining the crayons; but wondering if they <br/>
took the stamp?  On 3/5/04 normal entry in logbook; 3/14/04 <br/>
letterboxer indicated stamp was missing.  There were two more entries <br/>
after that stating "Our First find"!!  4/5/04 stated contents were <br/>
very soggy! and 4/17/04 Shannon, Rich, Donna stated their "first <br/>
find".  4/18  we were next to find only crayons, logbook, pencil.  We <br/>
stamped in and indicated that "letterbox stamp" was missing. Appears <br/>
to be maybe some geocache confusion????  Too bad cause the #2 stamp <br/>
completes the #1 stamp!<br/>
