night due to what they felt was excessive load on their <br/>
database server. I've found several optimzations that can <br/>
be made (thanks to Ryan for his tips).<br/>
<br/>
I spent most of the day yesterday loading LbNA on a new <br/>
web hosting service and experimenting with optimizations. <br/>
If we can't get the current hosting service to restore <br/>
service by the end of today, I'll provide a temporary link <br/>
to the new hosting service and start the process of <br/>
pointing letterboxing.org to it.<br/>
<br/>
My apologies to everyone that missed out on some boxing <br/>
this weekend because of the problems.<br/>

Do that voodoo that you do so well.  :)  I'm sure we all appreciate all the <br/>
hard work that you put into the site so we can enjoy letterboxing.  :)  No <br/>
pressure.<br/>

Hi Choi<br/>
Everyone appreciates your efforts and occurances like this give <br/>
everyone a time to reflect on those efforts. Many of us take this <br/>
site for granted, which we should not do. <br/>
This also gives everyone an opportunity to try to solve some of <br/>
those difficult mystery boxes or do some heavy duty carving.<br/>
I understand that the right coast is getting hammered by snow and <br/>
ice so who wants to box in those conditions.<br/>
Here in Kernville I had to slather the sun block on yesterday as I <br/>
spent the day working outdoors in 77 degrees. It was a hot, <br/>
thankless job, but somebody has to do it. Now thay little tidbit <br/>
should help those in the east to get their mind off of the site and <br/>
concentrate on their environmental jealousy. Atleast temperature <br/>
wise.<br/>
