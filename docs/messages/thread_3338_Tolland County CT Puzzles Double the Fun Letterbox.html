<br/>
We've found the Puzzles Double the Fun Letterboxes!  Thank you, Leader of <br/>
the Pack for the enormous effort that must have gone into it.  You've all <br/>
got to go do these boxes, the clues are really excellent.  This is not your <br/>
typical letterbox hunt, that's for sure!  There's a really great surprise at <br/>
the end, too.  Something really fun for Larry Boy and Dino Boy!<br/>
<br/>
Near one of the boxes we saw the most beautiful thing growing.  It was a <br/>
white mushroom or fungus or something.  It looked kind of like a twice baked <br/>
potato but bigger!  We also saw a blue heron (we think) while exploring <br/>
after finding the boxes.  It was one of the rare times my husband came along <br/>
and we really enjoyed it.  Thanks again Leader of the Pack!<br/>
