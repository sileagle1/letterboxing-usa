                    <div class="plaintext-content">I finally got the chance to do some maintanence on these boxes.  Only<br/>
th Shuttle Craft was in serious need.  A new log book was added to<br/>
replace the waterlogged one and the box was replace to replace the<br/>
cracked one.<br/>
<br/>
Also - I moved the location of the box and have changed the clues to<br/>
reflect that change.  I am hoping that this will help that box to<br/>
have a longer life.<br/>
<br/>
These trails are truely amazing.  During my travels today I saw many<br/>
different species of birds, lots of plants in bloom, huge frogs and<br/>
tadpoles.  In general, life is in full bloom on these trails.  It was<br/>
a real pleasure (wet log book aside) to walk these trails and witness<br/>
all this.  I was also very happy to see so many 1st time boxers<br/>
logging in to the DAR box.  My sincere apologies to any one who was<br/>
disappointed about the second box and hope that it's problems have<br/>
been solved.<br/>
<br/>
The shuttle pines are an amazing thing to think about.  Seeds having<br/>
traveled so far and then growing strong makes all things seem<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The weather is finally improving and I wish you all a happy boxing<br/>
weekend, with special thoughts to those who this weekend is intended<br/>
to honor.<br/>
