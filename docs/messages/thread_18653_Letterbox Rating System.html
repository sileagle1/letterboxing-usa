                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to let everyone know about the upgrade done last night to the Letterbox Rating System (LbRS).  The <br/>
following things have been added/changed in response to the feedback I've gotten.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the overwhelming requests, Pet friendly has been returned to Dog friendly as this more accurately covers what <br/>
we are looking for here. I mean, no one's ever complained about a pet cat running down the trail and jumping up on <br/>
someone slobbering all over them. Nor has anyone complained about someone's pet lizard barreling down the trail, <br/>
though, I'll tell you what, if I saw someone's pet Iguana barreling down the trail at me, I'd be hard pressed to not <br/>
stand there in shock, completely amazed. Besides, the signs we see at a park show a Dog on a leash, not a cat or a <br/>
lizard.<br/>
<br/>
Also, due to overwhelming requests for these additions, I've added the following additional ratings. P for Parking <br/>
Fees, E for Special Equipment and TED for Total Estimated Distance.  The new P and E ratings are now placed at the end <br/>
of the current string and the TED is combined into the current T or Trail rating to give a combined score.  The TED <br/>
ratings are:<br/>
<br/>
0 = Unknown<br/>
1 = 0 to 1/4 mile<br/>
2 = 1/4 to 1/2 mile<br/>
3 = 1/2 to 1 mile<br/>
4 = 1 to 2 miles<br/>
5 = Over 2 miles <br/>
<br/>
And the new ratings would look like this:  'T2-2' which would mean an Easy trail with a Total Estimated Distance of <br/>
between 1/4 to 1/2 mile.<br/>
<br/>
Parking fees is a simple Yes/No question. If the spot you start someone out from requires them to pay parking should <br/>
the park there, then a yes is a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Special equipment is as well also. If any special equipment is required, other than the normal day hike items, then <br/>
select Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to keep your current ratings if you want to, the old style will not break the decoder, it decodes both new <br/>
and old formats as well.  If you want to update your current ratings on your letterboxes, feel free to do so.<br/>
<br/>
As far the request to include the rating for "NDQ" (Nearest Dairy Queen) and "NBH" (Nearest Brew House), I'm sorry, <br/>
but I believe that extra curricular activities are something for each person to experience on their own, in their own <br/>
way! ;-)<br/>

<br/>
oh-KAY!<br/>
<br/>
On about my 5th letterbox outing I saw many dogs and in fact one VERY LARGE lizard on a <br/>
leash out for walkies.  It sure as heck wasn't barreling down the trail.  More like a slow <br/>
*lumbering*, but it was quite the sight.  I was killing me that I hadn't brought my camera.<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure that if I had the need to walk MY pet lizard though, I'd probably be able to <br/>
figure it out from a "dog" friendly option.<br/>

To anyone that has used the Letterbox Rating System, please make one simple<br/>
change to the code you've placed on your websites.  Please change any<br/>
reference from www.myndworx.com to www.lbworld .org<br/>
<br/>
We have recently moved to a domain that is much more appropriate and to a<br/>
faster server as well.<br/>
<br/>
This also goes for any Topsites members as well.<br/>

Thank you.....<br/>
