Hi Aili,<br/>
<br/>
I use mostly Sanford Magic Rub erasers with the smallest straight <br/>
razor X-Acto knife, which I found with the scrapbook supplies in the <br/>
craft store.  The erasers are also in most craft stores in the <br/>
drawing section and cost less than $1.00 each. The knife goes through <br/>
the eraser very easily and doesn't slip towards the fingers the way <br/>
the larger X-acto had.  I think a child's small hand could easily <br/>
manage the two.  The only drawback to the Magic Rub eraser is it's <br/>
size (about 1" by 2 1/2")  Sometimes reducing and making the image <br/>
fit (I use the acetone transfer of photocopied images method) can be <br/>
frustrating.  I'd ordered some PZKUT from Stampeaz which I found hard <br/>
to cut through with an X-acto knife.  It comes in large blocks which <br/>
can be cut to suit.  For kids though, I'd keep it simple and safe.  <br/>
<br/>
You might also want to consider buying a few sketch books and a <br/>
supply of brads.  The plastic binder can be removed from the book and <br/>
the pages cut into at least thirds and joined with brads for easy, <br/>
inexpensive journals to include in the girls' letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and have fun!<br/>
<br/>

    I use a speedball cutter available at art stores and craft stores, such<br/>
as AC Moore.  I cut it out of Mars Stadler erasers.   The speedball cutter<br/>
is pretty sharp though.  I guess using that would depend on the age of the<br/>
children.  This summer, at camp, I did some letterboxing with my campers.<br/>
They were only 6, 7, and 8 years old so we used this craft foam.  It comes<br/>
in all different colors at any craft store.  It is about the size of a sheet<br/>
of paper and maybe 1/16 or 1/8 thick.  I had the kids draw there design on<br/>
the foam and then cut it out with scissors.  Then, we glued the foam on a<br/>
block of wood.  The designs were pretty large and simple, but it was safe.<br/>
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  Good Luck!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For really little kids you might want to start with something like <br/>
scratchfoam that requires no cutters at all. You just press in the <br/>
images with a pencil or something similar. Not "real" stamp carving, <br/>
but a great start to get a kid into the idea of creating their own <br/>
images, and about as safe as you can get (especially when combined <br/>
with water based nontoxic markers for ink).<br/>

I use a speedball carving tool I got at my local art store- it came<br/>
in a kit with a handle, two blades, a block of pink carving material<br/>
and a sheet of tips for cutting and ideas for things to carve.  I<br/>
remember being in elementary school using the same kind of cutters in<br/>
art class, at around 4th grade, so they should be able to manipulate<br/>
the tools.  The pink blocks are also sold separately in different<br/>
sizes and can be cut up into smaller pieces.<br/>

I have a Brownie troop and a LBer friend has a Junior troop.  We were <br/>
planning on developing the requirements for both LB try-it and badge <br/>
and having a joint hike.  I don't know if you would be interested in <br/>
collaborating on the badge part.  We were going to design the badges <br/>
and have them made.<br/>

the participating leaders as it seems easiest for the younger kids--I made one myself and it took about 2<br/>

And, since my troop has most of the older girls in town, I'll offer them choices so each girl can decide her<br/>
