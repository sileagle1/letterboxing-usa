letterboxes, at beautiful Hains Point in Washington, DC:<br/>
<br/>
Cherry Blossoms<br/>
<br/>
About 5 level miles round trip from the Jefferson Memorial. 100 yards <br/>
of walking if you drive: very kid-and-elderly-oriented.<br/>
<br/>
Walk, run, ride, roll, or drive past the Jefferson Memorial to the <br/>
southern tip of Hains Point, following the signs for East Potomac <br/>
Park. This is a wonderful open area with vast views of the river and <br/>
is marvelously refreshing to jangled nerves from the hustle bustle of <br/>
Washington.<br/>
<br/>
Just north of a most surprising statue is a playground. The Cherry <br/>
Blossom Letterbox lives in the golf course fence line north of the <br/>
mound and the restroom. At the fence on a service road, exactly lined <br/>
up with the eastern face of the restroom, take about 60 steps <br/>
easterly, to the end of the mound. Facing the fence, the box is on <br/>
the ground in the space between the fence and a tree, under a flat <br/>
rock brought for the purpose from a New England stone wall. Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
