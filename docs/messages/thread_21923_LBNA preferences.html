I don't actually ever hope to be the first finder any time I set out, but<br/>
twice this year we were the first finders when we never ever expected to be.<br/>
The surprise was kinda cool.  I'd rather not know ahead of time.  I'd prefer<br/>
to be surprised.<br/>

I would like the option of turning off the little flags and NOT seeing<br/>
who has found the box. That way I still have hopes being the "first<br/>
finder" until I actually find the box.<br/>
