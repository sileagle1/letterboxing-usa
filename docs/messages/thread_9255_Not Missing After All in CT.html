                    <html><body>Here are the clues to a collaboration between Butterfly, Bluebird, and the DrewClan. Milo Light in Montville CT (New London County) is an expanded series of 3 letterboxes in a terrific Nature Conservancy preserve. We have the gracious permission of the park manager to place our letterboxes there. Enjoy!

<br/>Milo Light II, Too
<br/>Two Boxes plus One!
<br/>
<br/><i>(Not missing after all...here's a note from our wonderful letterboxingfriend, Butterfly:
<br/></i>
<br/><i>"The Story: As October 2002 approached, I realized that I had beenletter boxing for one year. An eventful year and one filled with many enjoyable hunts into places I would never dreamed existed had Inot been introduced to letterboxing.
<br/></i>
<br/><i>Looking at my log books and the 500 plus stamps impressedforever on the pages, I thought of putting an anniversary box at Milo Light, myvery first find.  How sad to learn the box was reported missing. I wrote to the Drew Clan expressing my sorrowfor the missing Milo Light box, and telling what I wished to do.
<br/></i>
<br/><i>That very night, Jay Drew carved a new Milo Light stamp and leftit on my door step, complete with box and new log book. Bluebird and I went off to Milo to put the new box in the old place, andOOPS, we found the old box still in its hiding place! Not lost, never missing -just waiting.</i>
<br/><i>Humm now we have a new box!! This is what we did: we named itMilo Light II too. Here are the clues to my anniversary box and Milo Light IItoo").
<br/></i>
<br/>Three letterboxes in a sweet little Nature Conservancy property. About 3 miles/2 hours (out-and-back). Milo Light Preserve is located in Montville, CT, between Salem and Norwich. From either Rte. 85 in the east or Rte.395 in the west, take Rte. 82 to Rte. 163 North. Soon turn right onto Hershler Rd. Park in the Kingdom Hall lot or just beyond at the preserve entrance on your right.
<br/>
<br/>Begin hiking eastwards on trail #1 past the entrance sign. In about onemile of quiet woods walking, pass the stone foundations of an old farm site on your left. Continuing through the third steel gate, take the next left at a fork to head northeast alongside Trading Cove Brook. Follow downhill, with the brook to your left a short way from the trail. You'll soon see the end ofa stone wall about 12 steps off-trail to your right. There is apoorly-maintained sign indicating that you're leaving Nature Conservancy land. Find the originalMilo Light Letterbox living in the south side of the stone wall, just a stepor two past the butt-end.
<br/>Opposite the letterbox at the brook is an interesting glacial dam that is worth exploring. You'll know if you've missed this stone wall(one among many) and gone too far as a short way furtherdownhill the path will bring you out onto a dirt road and power line right of way.
<br/>
<br/>Now return west  crossing again over the seasonal brook by the third gate.  Stop at the old foundations on the northern side of the trail. In the 1870’s Daniel Appley homesteaded in this scenic spot. Imagine folks living here as you carefully walk to the north east corner inside the foundation. Facing southwest, now take three giant steps and you will be standing on your Milo Light II treasure. Please tuck it back under out of sight.<br/><br/> Continue on in a westerly direction and notice when you pass through anopening in a stone wall which lays in a diagonally east west direction. On thenorthern side of the trail the Happy Butterfly Anniversary Letterbox is tuckedunder a fallen log. Smile as you stamp in and think of all the letterbox treasures you have found during this past year.<br/>Keep traveling westerly on the trail back to your car. Hope you enjoyed Milo LightI and II, and Happy Butterfly, too.<br/><br/></body></html>
