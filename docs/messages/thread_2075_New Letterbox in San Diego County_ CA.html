<br/>
Between Ranchita and Borrego Springs, California is a sign welcoming visitors to Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. About three miles east of of the sign is Culp Valley Camp. East of the camp is Culp Valley Road. A quarter mile up Culp Valley Road, on the left, is the first of many rounded, truck-sized boulders. Tucked in under the overhang of the backside of this first big boulder, beneath a small, unnatural-looking pile of rocks, is the first letterbox in the Park.<br/>
<br/>
Please leave your vehicle at Culp Valley Camp and walk to the letterbox site. The junction of S22 and Culp Valley Road is very steep and the highway is practically invisible to vehicles climbing from it onto the highway. Turning onto Culp Valley Road from the highway is relatively safe and easy; returning to the highway is EXTREMELY dangerous!<br/>
<br/>
This is rattlesnake country. Mind your feet and hands. See also the Letterboxing Waiver of Responsibility and Disclaimer (http://www.letterboxing.org/mt/waiver.htm).<br/>
