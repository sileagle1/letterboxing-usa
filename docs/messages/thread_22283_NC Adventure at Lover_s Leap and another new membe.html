                    <div class="plaintext-content">Spurred by a report of a potential MIA, I climbed the "mizzen mast" and, <br/>
after carefully stepping around an AT hiker's laundry line, confirmed that <br/>
the Leapin' Lovers box is still in place.  I discovered a geocache there, <br/>
too, by mistake....and obviously some of the cachers found Leapin' Lovers - <br/>
somebody from Brazil left 10 centavos inside!<br/>
<br/>
The box was thoroughly damp, so I climbed back over the drying gear and <br/>
spread the contents out for a drying job of my own.  The hiker came down <br/>
from his tent site farther up the trail, and once we established that <br/>
neither of us wanted to mess with the other's stuff (and that Baguette la <br/>
Coquette was not interested in biting him), I told him about letterboxing.  <br/>
Turns out he had stumbled upon a box earlier in his journey (he's a section <br/>
hiker), and now "gets it."  I asked him his trail name - "Zero" - and carved <br/>
a stamp for him.  He was tickled to find another way to enjoy the AT.  I <br/>
told him about Ryan's (excuse me - "Green Turtle's") and Amanda's boxes, and <br/>
more of mine he'll pass as he goes north.<br/>

Since it's off the beaten path, but along the AT, please let "zero"<br/>
