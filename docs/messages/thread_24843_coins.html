A good size for a stamp -- I'd say under 2 inches. I carry two sig stamps - a larger one, 2" square for the average logbook and a smaller one, 1" square for small logbooks. If the logbook is smaller than 1", I'll leave a partial stamp image.<br/>

was designed to take ink.  I've been looking for a nice place to hide<br/>
a box that would use that as a stamp.  I've been trying to think of a<br/>
good way to hide a cache that would also be a letterbox, or<br/>
vice-versa, if you prefer ;-)  This geocoin would be the stamp, and<br/>
cachers could "Find" the geocoin.  It would be a way of helping each<br/>
group learn a little more about the other.<br/>

As for places to buy them, type "geocoin" into any search engine, and<br/>
you'll see over a dozen listings of places that design, mint and sell<br/>
them.  To avoid showing any favoritism, I won't give any specific<br/>
names,  but they aren't too hard to find.<br/>
