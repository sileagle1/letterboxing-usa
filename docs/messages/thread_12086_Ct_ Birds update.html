began their flight to the Northwest Park.  The Birds have new log books, <br/>
some of the old stamps have been re worked and there are two new birds <br/>
and one surprise added to the mix.  We , friends, want to thank everyone <br/>
who visited the series this winter. It proved popular and  the log books <br/>
were full of wonderful  comments and images of stamps that we will all <br/>
treasure.  Now as they move north and form a new series, we hope they <br/>
will give enjoyment to many more folks, and we invite old friends to <br/>
check them out for the additions, and changes to the stamps.  Their new <br/>
home is a great place with other letterboxes on the trails within the <br/>
park..<br/>
Watch for them , the clues soon to be posted as a new series with a new <br/>
name, on the Rainbow Trail.<br/>
