Easy clues and terrain<br/>
<br/>
The fashion statement for today is orange. From Route 495, take Exit <br/>
21B.  Continue straight through the light and have the luck of the <br/>
Irish as the road rises to meet you.  Enjoy the vistas of inland seas <br/>
on both sides.  Continue your journey heavenward, and just after mile <br/>
one, a celestial being will mark the place to take a left.  Follow <br/>
this road past the harvest of gold and Bo Peep's charges and later, a <br/>
pint-sized Ponderosa.  Look for the Sentry Post on your right - it is <br/>
your signal to slow down.  Watch for the Tribe's Crimson Fortress on <br/>
your left and park near the picnic bench.<br/>
<br/>
Sit down for a spell at the picnic bench as you listen to the Hunters <br/>
Falls on your right and gaze forward at another inland sea.  Glance <br/>
over your right shoulder to spot the entrance to the blue ribbon <br/>
marked trail.  Enter the trail, careful to follow the blue ribbon <br/>
trail.  Cross over the bridge and take in the full beauty of the <br/>
Hunters Falls on your left.  Continue along the blue flagged trail to <br/>
where the trail forks at a large boulder next to a freshly cut tree.  <br/>
If you look inland toward the right trail, you will see that the blue <br/>
flags continue there.  Instead, follow the unmarked left trail along <br/>
the water.   Fifteen paces from the freshly cut tree along the water <br/>
trail, you will find yourself in front of a pine sapling.  Reach <br/>
below the ledge rock beneath the sapling to bag your catch.<br/>
<br/>
Be *sure* to take my fashion advice and wear bright orange.  Enjoy!<br/>
