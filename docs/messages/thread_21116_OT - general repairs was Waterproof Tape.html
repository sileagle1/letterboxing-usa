Hey speedsquare, your Grampa wasn't a sailor was he? I would modify<br/>
his advice to include rope. (actually I'd say 'line' but that may<br/>
confuse some people)<br/>
<br/>
Just ask any sailor, or take a peek in their repairs locker for<br/>
yourself.  There will be lines of every size, and shape stashed away.<br/>
Sailors can't bear to toss out a hunk of line, no matter how small it<br/>
is ... "just in case" =LOL=<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

If the resident pirate can slip a word in here...<br/>
This is not a case of "Little Old Lady Syndrome".  When you're several<br/>
miles from shore, you can't run to the corner store for repair<br/>
supplies, so you make repairs from "what's at hand".  Therefore, you<br/>
*never* throw out anything that maybe useful.  <br/>
<br/>
When a board warps and your ship has sprung a leak, you stuff the<br/>
crack with that "frayed, hopelessly knotted, four inch scrap of line"<br/>
and then you paint it over with tar to make it waterproof.  After<br/>
that, you log it so proper repairs can be made when you get to port. <br/>
But that's why sailors never throw anything overboard if they can help it.<br/>

Hey, Bindle Babe!<br/>
<br/>
The Grampa I'm talking about was my dh's Grampa.  He wasn't a sailor, but my dad loves <br/>
to sail his Flying Scot, the Gute Fahrt!  I carved the Gute Fahrt and planned to include it in <br/>
a series called "Treasure Island."  I should have waited, since I see some others would <br/>
actually plant in areas difficult to access.  If you check out the photos in new_boxers, you <br/>
will see the stamp I will plant next year at Clear Lake.  The other stamps from Treasure <br/>
Island that became HH's are: Pinky Pie's Happy Feet, Link's Chillin' and my personal <br/>
traveller, Peace Out.<br/>
<br/>
MY Grampa never threw out ANYTHING when it came to correspondence.  He died in 1984 <br/>
before the ubiquitous personal computer.  He had every piece of correspondence in <br/>
triplicate filed in his office.  I often wonder how life would be different if he had known the <br/>
possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
I agree we all need lines/sheets too.<br/>
