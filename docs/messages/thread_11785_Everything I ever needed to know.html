<br/>
<br/>
Everything I've ever needed to know I learned from letterboxing!<br/>
One man's pace is another man's step.<br/>
What the word Esker means.<br/>
How to look inconspicuous (yeah right) while trying to smuggle a rubbermaid box under ones jacket .<br/>
What the word cairn means. <br/>
You can bury a man in a large keg of rum.<br/>
The small town of Mansfield, CT is keeping the Rubbermaid corp. alive &amp; well! <br/>
No matter how well you think you're explaining the idea of letterboxing, people are still going to look at you like you are                         nuts for running around in the wood hunting treasures hidden by a dog named Molly and people called Butterfly or                          pychomommy!<br/>
Falling off the side of a cliff is not a good excuse to exchange with letterboxing nurses. Give it time and you can meet them on             the trail.<br/>
Wal-Mart actually having index card notpads in stock can send you into a shopping frenzy.<br/>
A large mountain of pudding could kill you.<br/>
Don't take short cuts across large lakes of mud unless you have your hair and make-up done just right so you will look good on           the evening news. <br/>

I just came up with these while sitting here but I could come up with a million, how about you???<br/>
