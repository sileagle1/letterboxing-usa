Since we have hit most of the boxes in our immediate area, we decided <br/>
to head out to VA today.  In our travels we snared 5 boxes, placed <br/>
one, and dropped our hitchhiker, "Happy Trails" somewhere in Northern <br/>
Virginia.  <br/>
<br/>
I figure we covered between 8-10 miles of trails today (it's easy to <br/>
lose track when you are motivated) and my feet are telling me to find <br/>
a new hobby!  Too bad my head is still percolating with ideas and the <br/>
desire to box, box, box!<br/>
<br/>
Hey Squirrel, you need to head to VA and scope out our new box.  We <br/>
left a little something in there for you.  You're coming to the meet <br/>
and greet, correct?  <br/>
