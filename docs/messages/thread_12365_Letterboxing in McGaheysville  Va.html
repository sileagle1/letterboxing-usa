I'm up to six boxes now and think that letterboxing is a lot of fun. <br/>
I have to say that I did have an interesting day. I found the first <br/>
two boxes okay and when it was time to go down this steep hill twice <br/>
I didn't listen to my husband and fell on my bottom. However, I have <br/>
a very understanding hubby and finally got down safe and sound. We <br/>
were laughing and decided that I didn't have the right shoes because <br/>
they didn't have any traction. I found the third box without any <br/>
trouble and one of the boxes was a little wet.  This story would be <br/>
great for the book if interested.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering why people are placing their clues on this website <br/>
but not on the mainwebsite for letterboxing. I'm new at this so I am <br/>
still learning. Thanks for your help.<br/>

This talk list is how the clues get to the main web site...  well, at <br/>
least the "old" main web site.  That site <br/>
(http://www.letterboxing.org) did not have functionality for people <br/>
to enter their own clues and could only be updated by web masters <br/>
making changes to the web pages.  So when people placed a new <br/>
letterbox, they used this talk list as a way to announce that and the <br/>
web masters picked it up from there and added it to the "main site."<br/>
<br/>
The "new" main site (which is temporarily found at <br/>
http://letterboxing.wesgarrison.us/) has the functionality for people <br/>
to just add their own clues, rather than having to have the web <br/>
masters do all of the work.  It also has the ability to "announce" <br/>
the box to a special yahoo groups list that anyone can join, and <br/>
therefore get notification of new boxes.<br/>
<br/>
For a while, the two "main sites" are co-existing to allow people <br/>
time to get their clues added to the new site and still leaving them <br/>
available on the old site so people can find them to go out <br/>
letterboxing.  After the transition is completed and we are using the <br/>
new site exclusively, there will not be a need to post new clues to <br/>
this list any longer.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that makes sense.<br/>
