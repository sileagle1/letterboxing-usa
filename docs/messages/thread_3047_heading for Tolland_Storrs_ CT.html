The Penguin, Orange Parrot, and Rotten Egg are in the same park. I <br/>

 New England authors is a 5 minute drive from Crandall park. (the <br/>
logbook for the first box is separate from the box. I went to replace <br/>
it and it wouldnt fit in the box) It is temporarily inside a <br/>
ziplock.  (1hour)<br/>
<br/>
Shenipsit lake and Daisies in the Wood are fairly near to each other. <br/>
Ten minute drive from Crandall Park.<br/>
(1.45 hrs combined?)<br/>
<br/>
Mansfield, CT is loaded with great boxes. Do stop by kathy-Johns ice <br/>
cream shop. Junction route 194 and 44.<br/>
