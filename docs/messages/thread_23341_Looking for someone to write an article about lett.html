(with photos if possible) about letterboxing.  THe zine is about mail <br/>
and paper arts, but I think people would be very interested in <br/>
letterboxing as well...but I just don't know enough about it.<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested, please send me an email to:<br/>
serendipityartist@yahoo.com  <br/>
<br/>
I can't pay (my zine doesn't make me a dime) but it will bring this <br/>
very cool hobby to a whole bunch of interesting people!  And you might <br/>
just start to find even more artistic stuff being left in your <br/>
letterboxes!  ha!<br/>
