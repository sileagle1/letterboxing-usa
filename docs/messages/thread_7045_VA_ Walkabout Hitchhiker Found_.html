Saturday, August 17, 2002, in Richmond, VA!<br/>
<br/>
It was placed in Ladybug's University of Richmond box in the Greek <br/>
Theater.<br/>
<br/>
I had stamped in at this box on August 9, so I stood back while Kelly <br/>
searched, found the box, and opened it. I saw a small plastic box <br/>
inside Ladybug's box and told Kelly that wasn't in there when I <br/>
stamped in. Kelly opened the box and we began to read the laminated <br/>
card inside. I screamed, "Oh, my God, Kel, you found a hitchhiker!" We <br/>
screamed and jumped up and down for a few seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Kel stamped the Walkabout stamp into the Greek Theater box and Kel <br/>
took it with her to our next box, a relatively new box in Rockwood <br/>
Park in Chesterfield County. Not only were we the first to stamp into <br/>
this box, but whoever finds it after us will get a hitchhiker! C'mon, <br/>
Richmond-area letterboxers, go for it!<br/>
