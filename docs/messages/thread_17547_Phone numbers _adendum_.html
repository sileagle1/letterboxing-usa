I forgot to add that in the "getting started" section that the<br/>
postcard suggestion is actually what I contemplated over when I first<br/>
began placing my boxes. Since last year I have put postcards in<br/>
several of my boxes and had fantastic results.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who remember the "Lavender" saga... well, I have<br/>
about 6 postcards from that episode, and many others. I suggest (if<br/>
you feel comfortable with this) instead of a phone-number to leave a<br/>
"calling card" or a SAS postcard.<br/>
<br/>
The postcard idea is wonderful. You get it back in the mail and not<br/>
only can you update the last time the box was visited, but you see an<br/>
image of the stamp, and the finder has a space to leave their stamp<br/>
and/or a short note about their visit. <br/>
