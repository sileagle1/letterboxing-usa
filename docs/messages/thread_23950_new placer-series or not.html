Series are fun. I have not yet figured out yet how to plant a box then<br/>
add others one by one to make a sereis, I am unsure if that is possible.??<br/>
anyone else with more LB wisdom have insight?<br/>
<br/>
Have fun planting, and hope you are able to get more people interested.<br/>
Have fun searhcing for boxes when you can.<br/>

I have an answer for you both that will satisfy both of your needs.<br/>
<br/>
When I plant a series (but this is just how I do it), I give it a <br/>
series "umbrella name", then give each box an "individual name".  <br/>
Look at my clues for "Blade Runner" and "RI Refreshments" as <br/>
examples.  This works well if you plant *all* the boxes in the series <br/>
all at once and post the clues all at once.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is the option of planting a series one by one, adding <br/>
boxes as you go.  The "umbrella name" for the series and <br/>
the "individual name" for each box is the same - BUT - you can enter <br/>
the boxes one by one as you go.  Look at the clues for "Native Son" <br/>
in MA for this type of example.  Each box was planted individually at <br/>
different times.  The individual boxes are named "Native Son #1: John <br/>
Smith", "Native Son #2: John Doe", "Native Son #3: Jack Black" (not <br/>
the actual names, just examples).<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps!<br/>
