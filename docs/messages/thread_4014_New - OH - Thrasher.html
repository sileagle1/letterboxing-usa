Difficulty: 1  a walk in the park<br/>
Hueston Woods State Park, Prebble County, OH<br/>

I was in the park today recording some data for my thesis.  This park <br/>
happens to be 46 miles from Xenia Ohio where my friend was acting as <br/>
the other radio operator.  A great place to collect Near Vertical <br/>
Incidence Skywave antenna data!  I have been here many times to sail <br/>
in the summer, but had never seen the lake and woods so cold.  It was <br/>
20 degrees and there was a cold stiff wind coming off the lake.<br/>
<br/>
Begin by finding the Lodge and Conference Center at Hueston Woods <br/>
State Park.  This park is north of Oxford Ohio, the location of Miami <br/>
University.  More hints:  Northwest of Cincinnati, Southwest of <br/>
Dayton on the state map.<br/>
<br/>
Beginning at the flagpole in front of the lodge, walk across the <br/>
grass and over a hummock at 300 degrees for 109 paces.  As usual, 1 <br/>
pace = 2 steps or about 5 feet.  Arriving at a light pole at the <br/>
wood's edge, take the trail from this point down the hill into the <br/>
woods.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the quiet woods and the views of the lake from the path.  <br/>
Across the lake you will see the public swimming beach.  A few months <br/>
from now that might be more appealing.  <br/>
<br/>
At the second wood bridge, there is a post with an arrow on its top, <br/>
pointing out the short loop.  From this post, head into the woods <br/>
straight south 26 paces to a large tree rotting on the forest floor.  <br/>
At the near end of this tree, against the ground and protected by 3 <br/>
two-inch diameter logs, is the thrasher.<br/>
