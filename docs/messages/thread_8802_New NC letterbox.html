Road to Nowhere Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed: October 24, 2002 by the Buds<br/>
<br/>
Location: Great Smoky Mountains National Park, northwest of<br/>
                    Bryson City, North Carolina (Swain County)<br/>
<br/>
Supplies Needed Compass<br/>
<br/>
Time: About an hour<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From Bryson City, NC, take Everett Street north from the<br/>
Everett Street Diner in the center of town.  This restaurant, open for<br/>
breakfast and lunch, serves delicious food.  Follow Everett Street from the<br/>
Diner for a total of 2.8 miles north. You will pass the Bryson Train Depot,<br/>
Swain High School, and will notice this road has changed names to become<br/>
Fontana Drive.  It is listed on maps as Lakeview Drive. After the 2.8 mile<br/>
drive, go past the Road to Nowhere" sign and the entry sign to the Great<br/>
Smoky Mountains National Park.  There is a gate here that may be closed in<br/>
winter. The gate you seek is several more miles. This gate marks the end of<br/>
the driving road. Park and walk toward the tunnel.  Clues start here.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
        Head for the light at tunnel's end,<br/>
        This is where your quest will begin.<br/>
        Take the trail that is straight ahead;<br/>
        When the 2 forks appear, pretend the bears have led.<br/>
        Pass through the thickets of laurel,<br/>
        Cross the small creekbed with metal, won't snarl.<br/>
        From here we go up and look to the right.<br/>
        The "peace" tree is a sign of a counting site.<br/>
        From this tree count 158 steps, about,<br/>
        You'll come to 3 trees, pay attention to the route.<br/>
        These friendly trees, two of them hug,<br/>
        One leans across your path to make you feel snug.<br/>
        Walk around the corner of the trail,<br/>
        At left the first oak is your way to the grail.<br/>
<br/>
        Head 220 degrees to the small table rock,<br/>
        Go 230 degrees down to the next cluster of rocks.<br/>
        These have a moss cover<br/>
        With a small maple tree lover.<br/>
        Go down from this maple degrees one-seventy<br/>
        To rocks down slope which lead to the cavity.<br/>
<br/>
        Seven steps from the south side of the rocks<br/>
        Look for the spot, a Hobbit hole mocks.<br/>
        The hole in the tree is about waist high<br/>
        Remove the bark and rock, your prize is neigh.<br/>
        Stamp in, replace the box, the bark, and the rock.<br/>
        Turn around to follow red blazes that mock.<br/>
        Your journey continues if you want<br/>
        Or back to the car, you've ended your jaunt.<br/>
