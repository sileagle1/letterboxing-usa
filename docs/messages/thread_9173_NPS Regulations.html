I'm trying to find out where it says in the NPS regulations that <br/>
letterboxes and geochaches are specifically prohibited, or if it <br/>
actually does. I've searched through the archives, and can't find a <br/>
reference to a specific article in the regulations. I know we've <br/>
talked about this a lot on the list. Can anyone help me? I'm ::this <br/>

sanctioned boxes in certain areas.<br/>
<br/>
The only post that I remember reading that had much about an actual <br/>
regulation was Message 1865.  <br/>
<br/>
Here if a link for NPS information: http://www.nps.gov/<br/>
<br/>
Here is the CFR that seems to deal with letterboxing issues: <br/>
<br/>
http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/get-cfr.cgi?<br/>
TITLE=36&amp;PART=2&amp;SECTION=1&amp;YEAR=2001&amp;TYPE=TEXT<br/>
<br/>
...for those that do not want to read it there I am posting it <br/>
below.  Like most CFR's the specific regulation is subject to <br/>
interpretation.  There may be some NPS policy that has been <br/>
developed to clarify the NPS's position on this regulation, but I am <br/>
not sure where that would be available.<br/>
<br/>
One could argue that responsible letterboxers would not do anything <br/>
that would violate the regulation.  I am assuming that no <br/>
responsible boxer would put a box in a sensitive archeological area, <br/>
hide (or search for) a box in a manner that requires digging, or <br/>
hide (or search for) a box in a manner that is destructive.<br/>
<br/>
The superintendent is given broad discretion in the regulation.  <br/>
Each park may have a different perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the regulation's text: <br/>

      TITLE 36--PARKS, FORESTS, AND PUBLIC PROPERTY<br/>
<br/>

area.<br/>
    (iv) Gathering natural products outside of designated areas.<br/>
    (v) Sale or commercial use of natural products.<br/>

taking, <br/>
use or possession of fish, wildlife or plants for ceremonial or <br/>
religious purposes, except where specifically authorized by Federal <br/>
statutory law, treaty rights, or in accordance with Sec. 2.2 or <br/>
Sec. 2.3.<br/>

What it says is that you can't leave property in the park unless you <br/>
have permission.  Here is an excerpt of the reg:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TITLE 36--PARKS, FORESTS, AND PUBLIC PROPERTY<br/>
<br/>
CHAPTER I--NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR<br/>
<br/>
PART 2--RESOURCE PROTECTION, PUBLIC USE AND RECREATION<br/>
<br/>
Sec. 2.22 Property.<br/>
(a) The following are prohibited:<br/>
(1) Abandoning property.<br/>
(2) Leaving property unattended for longer than 24 hours, except in <br/>
locations where longer time periods have been designated or in <br/>
accordance with conditions established by the superintendent.<br/>
(3) Failing to turn in found property to the superintendent as soon <br/>
as practicable.<br/>
---------<br/>
It goes on and on about impounded property.  If you want to read all <br/>
of Sec 2.22, go to message 16882.  <br/>
