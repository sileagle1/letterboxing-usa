I hid two boxes on a trail at the Quabbin Reservoir in Pelham today.  The <br/>
Quabbin is a huge place, thousands of acres, so I hope others will start <br/>
hiding boxes there too.  There's no reason it can't be the Dartmoor of New <br/>

Clues for Quabbin Reservoir Moon and Stars Letterbox and Salamander <br/>
Letterbox<br/>
Pelham, Massachusetts<br/>
Hidden August 4, 1999<br/>
<br/>
The Quabbin Reservoir was created in 1939 in the evacuated Swift River <br/>
Valley, in order to provide a supply of water for the city of Boston.  The <br/>
construction of the Quabbin required the building of two dams and the <br/>
destruction of the towns of Prescott, Dana, Enfield, and Greenwich.  By <br/>
1946, the reservoir was filled, creating one of the largest bodies of <br/>
untreated drinking water in the world.  The reservation also serves as a <br/>
wildlife sanctuary and offers numerous hiking trails on the nearly 40,000 <br/>
acres that are open to the public.<br/>
<br/>
Take Route 202 to the intersection in Pelham where 202 meets Main Street <br/>
(which comes from the west, from downtown Amherst, and ends at US 202).  <br/>
There's a flashing yellow light at this intersection.  Cross 202 onto a <br/>
gravel road that leads to a small parking area at Quabbin Gate #11. Note: <br/>
Depending on how long you rest by the water, this circular hike will take <br/>
about 3 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Park here, then walk back to 202, turn right, and walk about a half mile to <br/>
Quabbin Gate #12, which is on your right.  Please use caution when walking <br/>
along the highway.  Walk around Gate #12 and enter the woods on a gravel <br/>
road.  After about a half mile, you'll cross a stream and then the road <br/>
forks.  Go right.<br/>
<br/>
Walk on this path for a good 20 minutes (less if you're long-legged); the <br/>
Purgee Brook will be on your right, sometimes near and sometimes far.  Keep <br/>
going until, on your right, you see "Quabbinhenge."  (If you saw the movie <br/>
Spinal Tap, this little area should make you laugh.)  You can sit on of <br/>
these stone constructions and take a little break, or you can continue <br/>
onward for about 8 paces.  To your left you'll see a break in an old stone <br/>
wall.  Peek around on the east side of that wall to locate the Quabbin <br/>
Reservoir Moon and Stars Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Terrain:  Easy<br/>
Clue Level:  Easy<br/>
<br/>
Now, forward march to your next letterbox.  Keep going on this trail.  For a <br/>
brief stretch it is paved, then it bends to the right and after that it <br/>
crosses Purgee Brook.  Soon, on your left, you'll be able to see the <br/>
reservoir through the trees.  Then you'll come to a large stand of tall <br/>
pines on your right, at which point the trail curves to the right, away from <br/>
the water.  Stop here, and look around on your left for a large birch tree <br/>
that leans in the direction of the trail.  Walk off the path and go to that <br/>
tree.  Stand behind it, facing the water, and walk 28 paces to a fallen <br/>
birch log.  You will pass over the scattered remains of a stone wall.  Rest <br/>
for a moment on this fallen birch and listen to the water gently lapping in <br/>
the cove.  Your prize lies buried beneath your throne, hidden by two stones.<br/>

Way to go!<br/>
I've always wondered about the Quabbin Reservoir, but, in all these<br/>
years, never actually gone there. Thanks for the incentive!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Erik.  I have friends who love the Quabbin.  I hope that by placing <br/>
two boxes there, I have provided incentive for them to put boxes there as <br/>
well! (so I don't have to drive hours out of state to hunt boxes! :)<br/>
<br/>
Thom Cheney beat you to it on offering to scan my stamp images and I've <br/>
dropped them in the mail to him.  Next time, I'll send them to you (I think <br/>
I have your snail mail address somewhere in my letterbvoxing file, come to <br/>
think of it).<br/>
<br/>
If all goes well I plan to be in Braintree sometime on Saturday locating the <br/>
boxes there.  And someday soon I hope to venture farther, all the way up to <br/>
your boxes...<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

	Enjoy your trip to Braintree - Tom has done a fine job salting the area<br/>
with letterboxes (and a letterbook!) - sad to say, I've only been<br/>
hunting there once.<br/>
<br/>
	If you end up with time to spare, let us know - the river is good for<br/>
swimming, <maybe> a box by then!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting<br/>
