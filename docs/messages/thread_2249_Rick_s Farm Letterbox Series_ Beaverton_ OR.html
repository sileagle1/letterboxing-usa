Park was THE place to be.  They've made their way there and are eagerly<br/>
waiting for you to visit them!<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox series was placed on April 22, 2001 by Amanda Briles, The<br/>
Paisley Orca in  Washington County, Beaverton, Oregon.  <br/>
<br/>
Location:  Tualatin Hills Nature Park, Beaverton, Oregon.  On Millikan<br/>
Rd close to Murray Blvd. and Tualatin-Valley Hwy (Hwy 8).<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Pretty Basic<br/>
<br/>
This adventure starts at the Interpretive Center. Be sure and pick up<br/>
the clues to the Tualatin Hills Nature Park Series placed by Thom<br/>
Cheney.  Many his letterboxes are along the same route.<br/>
<br/>
Quickie The Rabbit - Oak Trail.<br/>
Take Vine Maple Trail from the Interpretive Center till you meet up with<br/>
Oak Trail.  Take Oak Trail to the first boardwalk.  Turn around to face<br/>
the way you came and go 20 steps.  At the small overgrown path to your<br/>
right take 6 steps. Quickie the low down rabbit is comfy in his hole.  <br/>
<br/>
NOTE:  If you're looking for Thom's second letterbox, this is not it,<br/>
though you might think it is.  Just remember the rock with the predator<br/>
on it as you proceed to other boardwalk areas.<br/>
<br/>
Rex the Golden Retriever - Oak Trail.<br/>
Keep heading down Oak Trail.  Immediately after the second boardwalk<br/>
your benchmark leads you 7 steps forward.  In front of a tall, beautiful<br/>
evergreen a slanted log beckons and Rex is wagging his tail happy to see<br/>
you!<br/>
<br/>
Lucifer the Goat - Old Wagon Trail. <br/>
STINGING NETTLES ALERT<br/>
After the long boardwalk with the gazebo go left on Creek Trail.  Head<br/>
down that way and take a right on Old Wagon Trail.  Where three trails<br/>
meet contiune right.  When you come to big roots making their way across<br/>
the path you're close.  Ahead is a mossy tree with lots of  branches<br/>
arching over the trail.  From the trunk of this tree go 25 steps forward<br/>
then stop.  To your right is nature's sling shot.  To the left Lucifer<br/>
stubbornly lurks ready to butt heads when you find him.  Be aware...If<br/>
Lucifer doesn't get you the stinging nettles might.<br/>
<br/>
Bubbles the Fish - Old Wagon Trail.<br/>
Proceed down Old Wagon Trail.  At the fork in the trail go left and over<br/>
the next boardwalk.  After the small boardwalk there are mossy,<br/>
many-branched trees bending to your right.  There's something fishy<br/>
about this tree and if you're diligent you can find out what.  Please<br/>
replace carefully so that letterpouch is hidden from view from both<br/>
comings and goings on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Puff the Bunny - Old Wagon Trail.<br/>
32 steps ahead of Bubbles there s a fragrant twin cedar "shelter".  If<br/>
you were a bunny where might you be hiding in this area?<br/>
<br/>
Clarabel the Hen Turkey - Vine Maple Trail.<br/>
Continue on Old Wagon Trail till you come to the fork of Vine Maple and<br/>
Lily Pond Trails.  Sit on the bench and look over your left shoulder.  A<br/>
prize gobbler is logging time along the length.<br/>
