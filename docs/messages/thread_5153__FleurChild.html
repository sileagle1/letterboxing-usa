&gt; Hi there<br/>
&gt; Thanks for placing the Angel's box...it was my first find and is in <br/>
&gt; perfect shape. The directions were great and the area is lovely to <br/>
&gt; wander through. <br/>
&gt; I was going to go get two of your other boxes, but I was running <br/>
late <br/>
&gt; and had to jet.<br/>
&gt; Thanks again!<br/>

Hi Jocelyn,<br/>
<br/>
I had posted a reply to your original post about finding Angel's <br/>
Lookout, but somehow it didn't make it to the message board, but my <br/>
reply to LMW &amp; YIMS did .... curious ...<br/>
<br/>
I found that spot by mistake when I tried to take a back road to get <br/>
from Point A to Point B.  I did eventually find my way, but went back <br/>
to place the letterbox and hence the name "Angel's Lookout".<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm glad you had fun with it.  I keep my clues and locations <br/>
very easy because of the increasing number of children that are <br/>
starting to letterbox.  I also appreciate finding letterboxes that <br/>
aren't too complicated because I have very low vision and every find <br/>
for me is a real treat!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails!<br/>
