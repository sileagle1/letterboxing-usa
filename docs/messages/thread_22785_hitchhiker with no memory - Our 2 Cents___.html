WeWe been boxing for over 2 1/2 years on both coasts, 2 countries and <br/>
a whole lot of area in between. in that time, we've come accross some <br/>
40 -odd HHs in various venues. Aside from a couple of normal LB clues <br/>
stating not to list finds etc on any unauthorized database, none of <br/>
these HH have specifically asked us not to list or mention the find. <br/>
In fact, I rarely even get an acknowledgement when we report the find <br/>
to an originator. <br/>
<br/>
We have listed several previously unknown HH on Wanda and Pete's site, <br/>
after attempts to contact the originator were unsuccessful. If in the <br/>
opinion of you veterans, this is wrong, sorry, but its been over 2 <br/>
years - I dont think the originators are too upset about it.  <br/>
<br/>
As you all know, this is a transient hobby, meaning there are tons of <br/>
folks who come and go as interest waxes and wanes. There are also tons <br/>
of LBs, PLBs, HH, cooties etc floating around unclaimed. <br/>
<br/>
IMHO, I say in the absence of any specific instruction NOT to <br/>
report/list/pass-on or whatever, and after reasonable attempts to <br/>
contact the originator have failed, go ahead and submit the thing!<br/>
<br/>
After all, this is supposed to be a hobby with no rules, only <br/>
guidelines.<br/>

Listing your find is not the same as actually posting a listing for <br/>
the HH at letterboxing.org, AtlasQuest or Pete &amp; Wanda's site.  If <br/>
you keep a web page with your finds, by all means feel free to list <br/>
it there.  If the HH is listed at letterboxing.org, etc., feel free <br/>
to log it there.  If however, the originator has chosen NOT to list <br/>
it, you should respect that decision.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; In fact, I rarely even get an acknowledgement when we report the<br/>
&gt; find to an originator. <br/>
<br/>
What kind of an ackowledgement are you hoping to get?  It would be <br/>
nice if everyone had the time to do a few back-and-forth exchanges <br/>
regarding every letterbox find, but for most people, this is a side <br/>
interest -- in addition to work, family, eating, sleeping, etc.  <br/>
While reporting a find is courteous and greatly appreciated, I am not <br/>
of the opinion there is any further communication needed past that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We have listed several previously unknown HH on Wanda and Pete's<br/>
&gt; site, after attempts to contact the originator were unsuccessful.<br/>
<br/>
Why on earth would you list somebody else's box or HH?  If it is not <br/>
listed, I think it is logical to assume, the creator CHOSE NOT to <br/>
list it.  Who are you to come along and decide it should be listed?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If in the opinion of you veterans, this is wrong, sorry, but <br/>
&gt; its been over 2 years - I dont think the originators are too <br/>
&gt; upset about it.  <br/>
<br/>
They probably aren't aware that the HH they chose NOT to list has <br/>
been listed by somebody else. How would they know unless they make a <br/>
habit of browsing the HH list looking for their HH's that they never <br/>
listed in the first place?  Frankly, before reading this thread, it <br/>
never occurred to me that somebody else might list one of my HH's at <br/>
letterboxing.org or Pete &amp; Wanda's site.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; IMHO, I say in the absence of any specific instruction NOT to <br/>
&gt; report/list/pass-on or whatever, and after reasonable attempts to <br/>
&gt; contact the originator have failed, go ahead and submit the thing!<br/>
<br/>
Given that the protocol has previously been for letterboxes and HH's <br/>
to be listed, or not listed, only by the creator, why would anyone <br/>
expect to find a HH specifically asking people NOT to list it?  When <br/>
they released it 1-2-3+ years ago, nobody would ever have dreamed <br/>
that future letterboxers would be disrespectful enough to second-<br/>
guess their original decision (to list or not to list) and take it <br/>
upon themselve to list the box/HH.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; After all, this is supposed to be a hobby with no rules, only <br/>
&gt; guidelines.<br/>
<br/>
The no rules part pertains to how you choose to play the game -- your <br/>
boxes, your hunting practices, etc.  It does not give you free rein <br/>
to take control of and make decisions regarding other people's <br/>
letterboxes and HH's.<br/>

<br/>
I respectfully disagree.<br/>
<br/>
Back in 2000, I was a "rookie".  I learned by making mistakes, <br/>
seeking advice, and doing some research.  Occasionally, a "veteran" <br/>
would take the time to help me out with a few pointers, <br/>
clarifications, and explanations.  I was grateful that the "veteran" <br/>
actually cared enough to help us "rookies" along.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, many of the now "veterans" have banded together to *actively <br/>
seek out "rookies"* and help them with the tricks of the trade.  <br/>
That's why the New Boxers talk list was created.<br/>
<br/>
I regret that you appear to have formed an opinion that this is some <br/>
kind of "us versus them" scenario.  This couldn't be farther from the <br/>
truth.<br/>
<br/>
If there is anything I can do to help you to understand that we are <br/>
all in this together, helping each other, please let me know.  <br/>
Sincerely.  I mean that.<br/>
<br/>
And with that sentiment, I believe that no one ever needs to put <br/>
anyone else "in their place".<br/>

 You seem to have found my HH - Hoppin' on.  No it is not listed on  <br/>
LBNa(Letterboxing.org), because when it went out, I listed it on <br/>
Wanda and Pete's site.  I'm pretty sure that I couldn't list it on <br/>
LBNa when it was launched, but that doesn't really matter.  However, <br/>
you stated that you have has my HH for some time and I have not <br/>
replied back to you.  I am very involved in Letterboxing,  I have not <br/>
just put stuff out there and then quit.  We have quite a few boxes <br/>
out there that we maintain and more planned and carved and ready to <br/>
go.  I got your e-mail dated (copied from the email) Tue, 1 Nov 2005 <br/>
19:47:11 -0800 (PST.  I opened up the e-mail, and since I don't know <br/>
who you are or what problems you were refrencing, I decided to check <br/>
out the letterbox-usa site and see what was going on.  I'm really <br/>
glad that the "parasite" owner e-mailed you back so quickly, but I <br/>
have another life. Also yesterday's e-mail is the 1st one i've gotten <br/>
from you.  Maybe another one went into my bulk mail and got deleted, <br/>
I don't know.  <br/>
This list is notoroius for DRAMA, which is why I am rarely on it.  <br/>
You might want to try one of the other letterboxing sites to get away <br/>
from all the bickering and griping.<br/>
As for my HH, I will NOT be listing it on the LBNa site, but I may <br/>
list it on the AQ site.  I agree that HH/boxes should only be listed <br/>
by the owner/placer/adopter.  And Hopppin on has a owner.  And I am <br/>
recognized on the LBNA site.  I have boxes listed and finds logged.  <br/>
HH's are not to be hunted for, they were supposed to be bonuses.  Not <br/>
something you go looking for.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't want to offend you, but all this drama is just ridiculous.  <br/>
<br/>
The number of finds isn't really all that important is it.  Isn't <br/>
this just supossed to be lots of fun???<br/>

The problem here is the medium that we are using. Email tends to be so impersonal - tone and expressions cannot be read. These boxers who have responded to any of these posts, including SpringChick, have taken the time to offer their knowledge and expertise. Use it as you wish but please respect these opinions.<br/>
<br/>
The vets of this group hold this game very close to their hearts. We're passionate about this hobby. That's what many of you see happening here. Passion and the love for something that we feel we must protect - like our children.<br/>
<br/>
In time, those of you who disagree may see what we mean. And then again, some never will. <br/>
<br/>
But above all, let's remain civil and agree to disagree.<br/>

PS. I suggest you read this list from the very beginning. Disagreements and differences in opinion are what made this list strong.<br/>

&gt; from you.  Maybe another one went into my bulk mail and got deleted, <br/>
&gt; I don't know.  <br/>
<br/>
You know, that's a really good point for those people who complain<br/>
about not getting a response after using Contact the Placer: E-mail is<br/>
notoriously unreliable. LbNA being on a shared server makes e-mail<br/>
even less reliable than it otherwise would to boot. They might end up<br/>
bouncing if the IP address tagged as being a source of spam (and while<br/>
LbNA doesn't send spam, other websites that share the same IP address<br/>
might), it might end up in a person's spam folder (I get so much of<br/>
that now, I don't even browser through the spam folder like I used<br/>
to), or maybe even the person went on vacation and their e-mail box<br/>
quota had already been filled.<br/>
<br/>
E-mail can be an *extremely* unreliable method of communicating, and<br/>
that was the MAIN reason I created AQ mail for Atlas Quest--to take it<br/>
out of that unreliable loop. Since I started digests on AQ, I took it<br/>
one step further and now require people to verify their e-mail address<br/>
before AQ will send digests to help ensure people don't miss them.<br/>
<br/>
Even with all that, though, it's not a perfect system, and<br/>
occasionally e-mails don't make it to their intended destination. If<br/>
it's really important you contact someone and get a reply, remember that. <br/>
