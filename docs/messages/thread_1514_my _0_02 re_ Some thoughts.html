I like the idea of having a database of clues as well as comments.<br/>
Those interested in other peoples comments could read them. Those<br/>
not interested could skip them. One option might be to allow<br/>
the person who planted the box to "opt in" for a comment list,<br/>
or "opt out" so that only the clue would appear. Perhaps those<br/>
who "opt out" could provide an email address to which comments<br/>
are forwarded. This would keep the person who planted the box<br/>
up to date on people's comments without sacrificing the mystery<br/>
of the clue. For fairness, all existing clues could be posted<br/>
without comments until the box planter tells you otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, does anyone know of a way to search the e-list<br/>
postings short of perusing them one month at a time? It seems<br/>
that a keyword search capability would be really handy.<br/>
