<br/>
<br/>
Off Rt. 81, Go on to Bartman Rd. Go down Bartman Rd till you get to the Stop sign at the intersection. To your right, you see Pokorny Rd.  At the Road name sign, you will see a path going into the woods.<br/>
    <br/>
     Go into the woods until you get to three trees with a rock in the middle of the trees.  Now go West, until you get to the SECOND rock wall. There you will see a pink ribbon. From here, go North until you get to two trees chopped down. (They are next to each other.)  Right before you get to the trees there is a rock wall.  Go West along the rock wall, until you get to a pink ribbon.  This ribbon has the number 460 on it.  From this ribbon, looking West take a right.  Keep going until you get to a pink ribbon with the number 461 on it.  Go three steps EXACTLY North, find the letter box in this area.<br/>

     Make sure you bring a stamp and a stamp pad! There is none in this Letter Box!</body></html>
