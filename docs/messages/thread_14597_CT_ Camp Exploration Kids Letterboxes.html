replant the first two Camp Exploration Kids boxes that I pulled for <br/>
maintenance.  BTW... I was never able to find the third box... so it may be missing in <br/>
its entirety... if you do find it however, please let me know!  (For those who <br/>
know where Eric lives are wondering how I went to Simsbury by way of <br/>
Windham..... trust me... don't ask ;-)  Anyway, while on the way, I did stop by the <br/>
Heublein Tower and grabbed Think Outside the Box.  I would have gotten Spring Has <br/>
Sprung as well, however, I was already late (oops!)....<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow, I officially start my letterboxing again!  Woo Hoo!  Eric already <br/>
thinks that I do need a 12 step program!!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting Everyone!<br/>
