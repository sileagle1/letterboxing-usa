                    <div class="plaintext-content">   Almost a year ago we found our first hitchhiker in one of our letterboxes - he was called The Haircut Rabbit (Jr). I think he started out in MD in the summer of 2002. Anyway, he's been to MD, VT, NC &amp; alot of places in CA &amp; now we are feeling nostalgic &amp; wondering if any of you fellow letterboxers have seen him &amp; moved him on his way....we'd love to know, not specifically what box(es) but just what town, city, or state.<br/>
     And if you're ever around the Montecito/Summerland CA area, check us out - there are ALOT of great boxes in this neck of the woods!<br/>
