                    <div class="plaintext-content">YES, you need a permit to plant a box in a National Park. National parks are frequently based on historically significant and sensitive properties and needlessly planting may destroy carefully maintained history. Besides, rangers change and boxes are supposed to be as timeless as those responsible for their maintenance can keep them. Today's ranger may seem ok with it, next year's ranger may contact you with a stern warning and notification that the box has been destroyed and you may face fines.  All in all, it may result in blackeyes for all boxers.<br/>
<br/>
It is up to us to respect the rules/guidelines of the original intent lest we find ourselves labeled as lawless renegades.  We then risk becoming the scourge of the non-boxing population.  <br/>
<br/>
 Just as you would not and should not plant on private property without an owner's permission, you shouldn't plant in National Parks without following the rules established by the guardian of that property.  <br/>
<br/>
If I am incorrect, please let me know as well. If I am correct, hope this helps!  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing,<br/>
