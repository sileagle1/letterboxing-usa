frequently, it's just part of the game. I have found from experience the longer you box the <br/>
less important finding the box becomes. When you are a new boxer and don't have many <br/>
boxes in your area and have to go a long way to find them it's a real let down not to find <br/>
the box. <br/>
Be the boxer you want others to be, respond to emails check your boxes, all that stuff. I <br/>
depend on e-mails from finders for my far flung boxes. If there is  a problem I want to <br/>
know, I may not get to the box but I enlist help from locals.<br/>
I know I know I should use spell check, Cyclonic.<br/>

Why do there need to be sides at all? Tony has his way of letterboxing<br/>
and that works for him. If other people don't do it that way, it is<br/>
not for them.<br/>

They do go missing but as a community we should encourage good maintenance practices. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps as a community we can consider a hider's list of principles:<br/>
<br/>
*plant in safe, family-friendly locations<br/>
*post accurate clues<br/>
*check or have someone check occassionally to see if landmarks have changed<br/>
*check or have someone check occassionally to see if the box is still there and in good shape<br/>
*respond to email on a timely basis<br/>
*if a box is reported missing put a note on the clue page and solicit help in confirming the missing status if you can't get out to check yourself<br/>
*update your clue page whenever needed to inform finders about the conditions/status of the box.<br/>
<br/>
I'd also like to note this from AQ (Apr 23 2006):<br/>
"all boxes that don't have an owner who has logged into AQ for one full year, I'm going to set those boxes up as being available for adoption. Less than 1% of the boxes on AQ fit this description, and as long as you log in once a year, you're boxes won't go up for adoption. This is about people who've stopped letterboxing altogether--or at least left clues on AQ that they no longer maintain."<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/boards/message.html?gMsgId=20557<br/>
<br/>
I don't think LBNA has a system in place to purge boxes that have been abandoned or are missing (although they will allow adoptions if it can be shown that the box is indeed missing).<br/>

 less important finding the box becomes. When you are a new boxer and don't have many <br/>
 boxes in your area and have to go a long way to find them it's a real let down not to find <br/>
 the box. <br/>
 Be the boxer you want others to be, respond to emails check your boxes, all that stuff. I <br/>
 depend on e-mails from finders for my far flung boxes. If there is  a problem I want to <br/>
 know, I may not get to the box but I enlist help from locals.<br/>

 &gt; Sorry, don't agree.  If I'm spending several hours between deciphiring clues, going to the <br/>
 location, and searching, the LB had better be there.  I think it's a little crass to place a box, <br/>
 post the clues, and then never check up on it.  Especially when there are people who do a <br/>
 considerable amount of travelling for LBing.<br/>

 &gt;   i might be wrong but i don't think tgd is referring to the number of<br/>
 &gt;   letterboxes around new england, but rather the idea of "making the drive,<br/>
 &gt;   and not finding anything." letterboxing is not about finding anything. it is<br/>

I believe as a community we DO all those things you listed.  At least the<br/>
involved people do.  I really don't see any way to make it any better.  You<br/>
can't force planters to do the right thing.<br/>
<br/>
Some people, who get into LBing for a short time, really excited about it,<br/>
they find, they plant, and then they leave.  Nothing much that can be done<br/>
to prevent that.  It happens.<br/>
<br/>
Just as in anything, some people will be more "responsible" and some won't.<br/>
<br/>
These things are why new boxers are discouraged from planting.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that on letterboxing.org could have a program for "orphaned" boxes.<br/>
<br/>
In fact though, I recently reported a missing box, after invesitaging I<br/>
discovered it had been abandoned.  I contacted LB.org and asked if I could<br/>
adopt it.  The process was quickly completed and it is my box now.  So, they<br/>
do have that option.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I look at finding a letterbox kind of like finding a pirate's treasure.  Or<br/>
searching deep waters for sunken ships with treasure.  I expect nothing.<br/>
Because nobody knows.  And if I find it, I'm most pleasantly surprised.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the principles......I don't mind "encouraging" things, that's<br/>
great, but writing up a list of principles?  Yuck.<br/>
<br/>
There really is no such thing as a safe, family-friendly location.  First<br/>
off, some placers might not really care if "families" find their boxes or<br/>
not.  Not everyone plants for families.  Nothing wrong with that.<br/>
<br/>
But that aside, a lot of planters might not know what the crime might be<br/>
like in an area they plant a box in, and might innocently think it's a<br/>
decent area.  And, crime aside, what's safe for one person might not be safe<br/>
for the physical or mental limitations of the next person.<br/>
<br/>
As a FINDER, I consider it MY responsibility to research that before I set<br/>
out.  Out here in the Chicago suburbs, many folks feel the Illinois Prairie<br/>
Path is very safe -- it looks safe -- they might be surprised to find out<br/>
just how much crime actually is committed on the path -- muggings, flashers,<br/>
robberies, etc.  Yet it certainly looks very safe.  )That's why I have two<br/>
boxes planted on the path north of the IPP -- the Great Western Trail --<br/>
because statistically, there's been much less crime on the GWT.  But<br/>
anything can happen anyplace, and if someone doesn't think it can, they're<br/>
just setting themselves up to end up in trouble.  ALWAYS be prepared.<br/>
<br/>
Accurate clues?  In general I'd agree, but many clues are much more accurate<br/>
than many people think but those people who think the clues are inaccurate<br/>
might just not be thinking outside the box the way they need to be for<br/>
following those particular clues.<br/>
<br/>
Checking on the box or finding someone that will?  That can mean no seed<br/>
boxes then in areas where boxes are incredibly sparce and thus letterboxers<br/>
are also sparce.  I have two word-of-mouth boxes up in Rusk County, WI right<br/>
now that I'm not putting online on my website at all just because I'm not up<br/>
there enough at my place to keep them maintained and I don't really know<br/>
anyone that I can trust to truly keep an eye on them for me.  There just<br/>
aren't many boxers in that neck of the woods (that I know of at least), and<br/>
I don't go to gatherings or anything to get to know them or anything if<br/>
there WERE any boxers up there.   But.....maybe boxers would rather I DID<br/>
put them online so that they could at least go looking for them even if,<br/>
heaven forbid, they've gone missing or been badly damaged or something.  At<br/>
least it gives a finder the option.  They can take their chances and look<br/>
for it.  Or not.<br/>
<br/>
And it often seems, from the sound of it, that fewer and fewer people may be<br/>
contacting the placer when they do find boxes to report on the conditions.<br/>
But I would never ever trust someone to report my box missing and have the<br/>
box actually BE missing anyway.  It might be.  It might also be sittin'<br/>
right where I placed it.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind, also, that although it might SEEM like all boxers are plugged<br/>
into online discussion groups, regional chat groups, forums, etc., I'll bet<br/>
that there are probably more boxers who aren't than who are.  I think most<br/>
boxers mostly go to either LbNA or atlasquest for their clues and that's it.<br/>
They don't bother with discussion groups, chats, forums, etc.  And the ones<br/>
who don't bother with those, aren't going to have much in the way of<br/>
resources as far as soliciting assistance on their boxes.  Should they then<br/>
not plant boxes?  Not in my opinion.  I'd rather they plant and I'll take my<br/>
chances as to whether the box is still there and what shape it's in.<br/>
<br/>
I might find the treasure.  I might not.  All in a day's search.<br/>
<br/>
I figure that people who want to be spoon-fed something should make good use<br/>
of the "contact the placer" function.  Find out before going what the place<br/>
is known to be like safety-wise, when the box was last checked, when the box<br/>
was last maintained, if the area is family-friendly, etc.  And if the placer<br/>
either doesn't reply or the reply makes it sound as if it's iffy as to<br/>
conditions, then contact the placer of the NEXT box with the same questions<br/>
:-) and keep movin' on down the line until a box is found that seems, to<br/>
that particular finder, to be worth going in search of.  I don't see<br/>
anything inherently wrong with folks wanting to be spoon-fed something, but<br/>
they could search out placers who ARE willing to spoon-feed them.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just wish folks would stop trying to make letterboxing a game<br/>
where all the square pegs have to go in all the square holes and all the<br/>
round pegs have to go in all the round holes, and just take it as it comes.<br/>
Sometimes it's kinda fun to take that square peg, a sledgehammer and<br/>
just......<br/>

I checked a certain box that had not been checked in<br/>

got an e-mail that it was missing from its spot, found<br/>
well away and opened, wet (veteran boxer saved remains<br/>

reported missing, each time it was were it was<br/>
supposed to be. Then it was reported found be newbie<br/>
geocachers. They jammed it in the closed hole they<br/>
could find and e-mailed me. This box was the second in<br/>
the series, where the first box disappeared months<br/>
before. When I showed up to investigate, the stamp<br/>
from the missing 1st box was in box #2 and the #2<br/>
stamp was gone. No reply to my e-mails. Bizarre, yes,<br/>
