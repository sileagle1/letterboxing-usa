                    <div class="plaintext-content">Jay, many letterboxers, including me, don't geochache so we <br/>
don't consider the database to be "geochacing style reporting" <br/>
with whatever connotations (good or bad) that may have. Many <br/>
see it as a convenient place to do a status check before<br/>
boxing. I might want to know that the box has been reported <br/>
missing so that I know to give the clues special attention, <br/>
or that the trail is overgrown with poison ivy. Do you have <br/>
more specific concerns that could be addressed?<br/>
<br/>
It is not meant to take the place of the wonderful letterboxing<br/>
stories that appear on the talk list and I don't imagine it <br/>
will diminish their numbers. Some people may choose to post <br/>
their lists of boxes visited only in the database, however. <br/>
<br/>
Certainly, if you don't want to participate you won't want to <br/>
list your own boxes and you can ask others not to post their<br/>
status as well. There isn't any way to prevent them from doing<br/>
so, however. Spoiler information should not be posted about any<br/>
of the boxes and will be removed is anyone points it out.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this has addressed some of your concerns.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In my mind, the database lessens the element of mystery which is an important part of the letterboxing experience. In one of my favorite finds I returned four times, never sure that anyone else had ever found the box (it was a sweet find!). Of course one always can choose not to view the database if you want to avoid the spoilers (which is more of a problem on the talk list anyway). <br/>
<br/>
A problem I do have with the database is the idea of "finders" listing "placer's" boxes so that the finders can then comment on them. Again this is a problem with the talk list. I've seen comments from finders on the list like "the clues aren't good", "the stamp is [nothing to be thrilled about]"...this kind of commenting is better done directly to the placer of a box and not to the whole letterboxing community. Personally I'd rather discover on my own that a letterbox has a handmade log book than to be told about it before I even go looking. <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate that someone took their time to try and help others with different ideas about finding letterboxes. However, perhaps we could leave it up to individual placers as to whether or not their boxes are entered into this database. In my view only the placer of a letterbox should be entering boxes into this database. <br/>

Thanks for considering,<br/>

Thanks for speaking up about this - I think it should really be up to<br/>
the placer to keep tabs on their boxes or designate a person in the<br/>
nearby area that is allowed to post on them. The current database<br/>
arrangement allows for ANYONE &amp; EVERYONE to know and to edit/delete.<br/>
Perhaps there is another option on the list so that only the placer<br/>
can edit.<br/>
<br/>
In Wes's multitude of "TO BE DONE" items on the web page, this might<br/>
be something that can be incorporated. Perhaps it's just up to the<br/>
"placer" to post their boxes and the "finders" to contact said<br/>
"placer" with update and then the "placer" will update (if they wish)<br/>
on the database. <br/>
<br/>
Just another dimension to add to the complexity! I've got to agree<br/>
that so far it's only myself for Maine that has posted about MY boxes<br/>
(I think) it's somewhat time consuming even to find my boxes, have to<br/>
re-select the view to alphabetize by ME and then scroll down. <br/>

<br/>
The fact that not all box placers would update the status of their <br/>
boxes, is not really a "problem."  Some want the status to remain an <br/>
unknown in the overall quest for the box.  That should be their <br/>
prerogative.<br/>

&gt; That way, future finders can make a more informed decision whether<br/>
&gt; to go after a box or not.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing I have already noticed with the database is that when a <br/>
seeker does not find a box, they list the status as "missing."  That <br/>
is very misleading and in many cases, downright inaccurate.  Just <br/>
because a particular person was not able to find a box does not mean <br/>
it is missing, no matter how sure they were that they were in the <br/>
right spot.<br/>
<br/>
With the status being stated as "missing" there is a high probability <br/>
that future seekers would avoid looking for this box, even though it <br/>
may actually be safe and sound, awaiting visitors.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I agree comments should be limited to<br/>
&gt; status only to not spoil it for others.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me, just the reporting of an incorrect status could easily <br/>
spoil it for others.<br/>

Actually, I don't think Wes needs to do anything here.  For example, on<br/>
the page for my Batcave box, which is currently missing, I have added a<br/>
line to alert potential finders that the box isn't there at present and<br/>
that I will post again when I have replaced it and rewritten the clues.<br/>
So, the option for box placers to include information on the status of<br/>
boxes they know to be missing is already in place.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't the same function as the letterbox database, but might be<br/>
useful in its own right.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought...<br/>

"Non-finders" reporting on the status of a box means they can  report the fact that they can't find the box, which is, indeed its status because AFATK, it's MISSING!<br/>

<br/>
Simple and easy and it doesn't give away anything.  Anyone looking at <br/>
my clues can see whether its been visited recently or not.  Now <br/>
granted, I only have 7 plants, but still ... <br/>
<br/>
So - just tossing that out there as an alternative.  If you find one <br/>
of your boxes listed on the database, and you don't want it there ... <br/>
just delete the entry.  <br/>

However, perhaps we could leave it up to individual placers as to <br/>
whether or not their boxes are entered into this database. In my view <br/>
only the placer of a letterbox should be entering boxes into this <br/>
database. <br/>
