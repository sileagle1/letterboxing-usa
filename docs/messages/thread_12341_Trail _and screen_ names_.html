feel no need to hide my real-world identity, but am glad for the <br/>
diversion provided by these playful monickers.<br/>
   My screen name with Yahoo (GraybeardR) began when I registered to <br/>
play their games - mainly a challenging board game called Reversi <br/>
(Othello), which comes naturally to a chess-player of some 70 years <br/>
experience.  And 'Cock o' the Trail' follows from long hiking <br/>
experience and - again - about 70 years of raising plain and fancy <br/>
poultry.  <br/>
   As they say, "you are what you eat" . . .<br/>
