fantastic resource for premodern artwork:<br/>

<br/>
"The Web Gallery of Art" has over 11,000 digital images of moderate<br/>
resolution (100-200k file sizes--some smaller image sizes (2x3) at 300 dpi,<br/>
others fairly large image size (7x10 or so) at lower resolution). I've had<br/>
some frustration trying to work with small, low-res files off the web, and<br/>
these provide more detail than a stamp carver could possibly need. <br/>
<br/>
Plus, it's just a cool tool to explore if you like art! Check out the<br/>
collection of illuminated manuscripts under the "gothic collection" if you<br/>
like that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, a cool photoshop technique that I haven't seen mentioned on the<br/>
various web guides to making stamp images with Photoshop:<br/>
<br/>
Convert the image to grayscale and then experiment with the "cutout" filter<br/>
(under "artistic" in photoshop 7.0). This gives sharper edges and less<br/>
"pointilature" than the "stamp" filter. Set the number of levels to two and<br/>
you'll get only black and white. "Edge simplicity" will increase or decrease<br/>
the level of detail. If you loose detail to too much dark or too much light:<br/>
undo the filter, raise or lower the brightness, then redo the filter. <br/>
<br/>
Manually adjusting the size and/or resolution of the image will also affect<br/>
the amount of detail you get when filtering. In my experience, it works well<br/>
to resize the image larger than your final stamp size, run the filter, and<br/>
then resize it back down to the size of the stamp you want.<br/>
<br/>
I'll see if I can't find someplace to stick up a few examples of these and<br/>
other "Phun with Photoshop" experiments on the web somewhere next week.<br/>

The Gallery link is terrific. Thanks for passing it on. As for using Photoshop for stamp <br/>
art, Brett Costley has a page on this topic:<br/>
