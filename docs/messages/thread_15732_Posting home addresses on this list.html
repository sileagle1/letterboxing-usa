While I'm sure the letterboxers on this list are good and pure <cheshire<br>
grin&gt;, who knows what the intentions of an accidental visitor to the list<br/>
may be.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you log onto the list's website, you can open your post and<br/>
remove it, but I'm not positive of that.<br/>

At the top of the page is a band that starts "Welcome", <br/>
under that is "letterbox-usa" and under that is <br/>
"Messages". The next line starts with a link for <br/>
"Reply". When it is your own message, the line ends with <br/>
"Delete". Push this link to delete the message.<br/>
