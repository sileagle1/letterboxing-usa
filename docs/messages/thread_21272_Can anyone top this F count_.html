In 2004 we hit F200 in August, F300 in September, F400 in October and F500 in November!  We're slowing down over the winter now and trying to concentrate on more carving and placing.  However more boxing trips are planned for later this year...<br/>

Grumpy Grinch of Lodi, CA. has been boxing since July 23, 2004 - not <br/>
quite 6 months.  Current find number is 215, that includes 13 <br/>
hitchhikers and 19 first finds.  We even found a hh carved by <br/>
Legerdemaine yesterday. Placed box count is 16 - a start.<br/>

Dearest Rebbeca,<br/>

Don't let the braggards get you down. They probably live in CT. Her<br/>
Ladyship is told that the entire state looks as if it were paved with<br/>
Tupperware; that a stroll through the woods of CT sounds like burrito<br/>
night in the colitis ward from stepping on so many Tupperware<br/>
containers. Her Ladyship also lives in a sparsely boxed area and<br/>
rarely finds time to venture far afield. There are other things in<br/>
life that draw ones attention. If one is only in it for the F count<br/>
(and it seems more and more clear that many of the high F's have<br/>
dubious counting methods but that's just between you and her Ladyship)<br/>
then one is perhaps missing the point. <br/>

<br/>
Just keep planting and being patient.  At the WNY gathering in Nov. I<br/>
was one of, if not the, senior-most local letterboxers there having<br/>
been involved for all of 18 months.  When I started I could boast that<br/>
I had found every letterbox between Rochester NY and Erie PA... both<br/>
of them!<br/>
<br/>
Now, there's a stack of printouts in my letterboxing backpack<br/>
representing about 25+ boxes within a 90 minute drive of my house.  If<br/>
you plant them, they will come!<br/>

Well said Lady P!<br/>
<br/>
Although we have a few pretty prolific letterboxers in<br/>
Texas, there are also quite a few of us that really<br/>
have to stretch out to get even one box.  The key is<br/>
that you enjoy getting the ones you can get, and plant<br/>
so you can draw in other unsuspecting future<br/>
letterboxing enthusiasts.<br/>
<br/>
I was in Hobby Lobby today and had an almost<br/>
irresistable urge to go down the stamp aisle and stamp<br/>
all their stamps into my log to increase my F count. <br/>
That would work, right?  ;^)<br/>

'Tis true Her Ladyship.  That is why there is a movement afoot to <br/>
count CT boxes as only 1/2 an F.  Maybe 1/3 F if they are less than <br/>
1/2 mile walking distance apart.<br/>

I was just teasing... we were not even in the states... we'd gone to letterboxing Mecca (a.k.a. Dartmoor)  When the Bandits starting boxing 3 years ago, our county only had 2 boxes... and there we only 5 within a half hour of our house.  There are now 39... most of them are Bandits plants, but that's ok... we're happy to see the sport grow tremendously in our area, with teams both planting and finding.<br/>
<br/>
The Bandits have 21 boxes packed and ready to be planted (just waiting for better weather), and another 50 (part of one series)in the various stages of production.  By the end of 2005, Dutchess County will have well over 100 boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to another subject... I have stamps that I've carved just for the heck of it... if anyone would like one to plant in their area... doesn't matter to me where, I'd be happy to send it.  You supply the "stuff"...  as long as I get credit as carver, it's yours to plant and maintain where ever you choose.  If you are interested, please e-mail me off list.<br/>

has 10.   We are new so maybe we are missing something.   <br/>

Once upon a time, there was a park in England, where the boxes were<br/>
hidden.  About 10,000.<br/>
<br/>
Then across a vast ocean, another place had taken up a hobby in 1998.<br/>
 And 7 years later, we have one state that rises above the rest, one<br/>
state where the letterbox count is more than the population.<br/>
<br/>
CONNECTICUT: MECCA OF LETTERBOXING<br/>
<br/>
I heard that last October a whole town was destroyed - entire forests<br/>
and parks - because of the hundreds of letterboxers who journeyed<br/>
through a place called Mansfield for a month where 130+ containers<br/>
rested in the woods.  So much trampled terrain from all the<br/>
letterboxers that the place has been shut down for 100 years for the<br/>
location to see some growth again...it's a barren wasteland<br/>
now...complete with its own rolling tumbleweed!<br/>

CONNECTICUT: MECCA OF LETTERBOXING<br/>
<br/>
I heard that last October a whole town was destroyed - entire forests<br/>
and parks - because of the hundreds of letterboxers who journeyed<br/>
through a place called Mansfield for a month where 130+ containers<br/>
rested in the woods.  So much trampled terrain from all the<br/>
letterboxers that the place has been shut down for 100 years for the<br/>
location to see some growth again...it's a barren wasteland<br/>
now...complete with its own rolling tumbleweed!<br/>
<br/>
Hahaha...(to those who need a laugh)<br/>

You said it TT. Id prob. never go home if I didnt have kids..hard to <br/>
box when you cant hike more than 1 mile round trip cuz of little <br/>
legs. Snuck out by myself the other day(snuck out of work early <br/>
too!) and found a box...and felt guilty cuz my wife wasnt there to <br/>
stamp in too. <br/>

Don't let the braggards get you down. They probably live in CT. Her<br/>
Ladyship is told that the entire state looks as if it were paved with<br/>
Tupperware; that a stroll through the woods of CT sounds like burrito<br/>
night in the colitis ward from stepping on so many Tupperware<br/>
containers. Her Ladyship also lives in a sparsely boxed area and<br/>
rarely finds time to venture far afield. There are other things in<br/>
life that draw ones attention. If one is only in it for the F count<br/>
(and it seems more and more clear that many of the high F's have<br/>
dubious counting methods but that's just between you and her Ladyship)<br/>
then one is perhaps missing the point. <br/>

Dear Lady Hydrangea Prisspott <br/>
<br/>
You are so wise!  My dear county has one box (population 450,000 <br/>
people and 350 square miles).  And that box is currently under 12 <br/>
inches of snow and was placed by moi!<br/>
<br/>
Have a wonderfully snowy day!<br/>
