Placed by: Wild Woman<br/>
Number of boxes: 1<br/>
Date: April 5, 2003<br/>
City: Portland<br/>
County: Multnomah<br/>
State: OR<br/>

<br/>
Directions: Wallace Books is located at 7241 SE Milwaukie Ave.,<br/>
Portland (in Sellwood/Moreland).  It is not open on Mondays.  You can call <br/>
for hours: 503-235-7350.<br/>
<br/>
I’ll get to the clues in a minute, but first a brief rant about the value of <br/>
independent bookstores, like Wallace Books:  One of the many reasons not to <br/>
buy your books from a chain bookstore (Barnes &amp; Noble, Waldenbooks, etc.) is <br/>
that publishers pay the chains to promote their books. This means that a <br/>
great book by a little publisher can languish on a bottom shelf somewhere in <br/>
a chain store (if they include it in their inventory at all), while a lousy <br/>
book gets top shelf or center-table billing because it was published by a big <br/>
house able to buy that promotion.  <br/>
<br/>
Independent booksellers, on the other hand, promote the books they love and <br/>
think that you might love, too. Supporting independents = a greater variety <br/>
of books and a greater diversity of authors.<br/>
<br/>
So look up the answers to the clues for this box on a chain’s website if you <br/>
want—but buy independent!  Okay *hopping down from my soapbox* here’s what <br/>
you need to know to find the box:<br/>
<br/>
The letterbox is a book.  You’ll have to puzzle out the title of the book, <br/>
but it is located on a Pacific Northwest Authors shelf, on an eastern <br/>
wall--the third shelf down. <br/>
<br/>
Fill in the blanks of these PNW authors and their books to learn the title of <br/>
the letterbox book:<br/>

The owner of the store knows about this letterbox, but for privacy while <br/>
stamping in, you could duck into the bathroom (through the Mystery Room.)<br/>
<br/>
(From Wallace Books, you’re quite close to Oaks Bottom Wetland, where these <br/>
boxes await your arrival: Nature Book 1, Oaks Bottom, and the Bike Route.)<br/>
