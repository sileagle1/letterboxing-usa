THANK YOU for letting me know about this.  I am the maintainer of <br/>
this box, and when I checked it a month ago, this was NOT the <br/>
condition it was in.  It will be fixed up within a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
On a secondary note - yes, I know that there is a geocache nearby, <br/>
but for the life of me, despite my best attempts, I can't find the <br/>
damn thing!<br/>
