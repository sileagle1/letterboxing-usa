<br/>
Placed in honor of My Very Dear Butterfly's birthday.<br/>
She is one who does the most Amazing things, like she<br/>
use to fly Yale professors from Tweed to Idlewilde in<br/>
her younger days. Enjoy!<br/>

Seems there was this movie actor romeo who won an<br/>
oscar, and was named Charlie. He was a man who could<br/>
eat many kilograms of food at one sitting, and he was<br/>
a yankee from up north. One November he took a trip up<br/>
to visit Echo Lake. Now Charlie weighed many kilos<br/>
from eating too much food, but after every performance<br/>
on stage, people still yelled ?Bravo!?.<br/>
While he was up at Echo Lake, he stayed at a hotel run<br/>
by folks from India, (who just came to America in<br/>
November); they use to live on a river delta that<br/>
flooded too much. His papa was an alpha male named<br/>
Victor, who was an indian from Lima. He was a famous<br/>
indian actor known for winning an oscar in November<br/>
for his famous foxtrot scene in a popular movie. He<br/>
drove an alpha romero sports car, which he also<br/>
purchased that November.<br/>
Charlie, the oscar winning movie romeo, in November at<br/>
Echo Lake, became quite the romeo off screen too,<br/>
causing some ladies to yell ?bravo!? after he danced<br/>
with them. He was fond of food from India, and he<br/>
enjoyed playing golf. But he liked best to tango, this<br/>
romeo, and echo?s of that music echoed on &amp; on in his dreams.<br/>
