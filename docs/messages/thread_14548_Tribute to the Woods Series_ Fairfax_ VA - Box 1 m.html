the landmarks mentioned in the clues for Box 1, and the hiding place<br/>

I also wonder what is in Box 1...I had a wonderful time with this <br/>
series.  It appeared to me that the area had been washed out but this <br/>
springs storms.<br/>
<br/>
I hope there will be a replacement as I am eager.  Still puzzling <br/>
over this one :)<br/>

of Box 1, so I think you're right.  Daughter of the Old Dominion says<br/>
she plans to replace the box at some point in the future.<br/>
