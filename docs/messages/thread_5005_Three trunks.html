2) There is a small parking lot near the front of the<br/>
park. After exiting your car, enter the park on the<br/>
paved road and begin your adventure.<br/>
3) To find the letter you begin your journey by<br/>
walking either to the right or left on the paved<br/>
trail.<br/>
4) If you go to the left, you past lucky post 13<br/>
first, continue to follow the trail, until you come to<br/>
area where you can branch off to an unpaved trail. <br/>
5) Follow the trail until you come to the area where<br/>
the bench marks the spot, and behind the bush you will<br/>
see a tree with three trunks. Go luck on your journey.<br/>
6) If you choose to go the right, the journey will<br/>
take a little  longer, but will be very rewarding. <br/>

You really should not be moving another person's letterbox.  If you <br/>
wish to hide one, you should make one up yourself.  I would hope that <br/>
you move this letterbox back to it's original location, there may be <br/>
folks who've printed out the original clues and are now searching in <br/>
vain for it. <br/>

I think the idea of a roving box is great. However, I would be really <br/>
bummed if someone did it with one of mine. It is so much fun to carve <br/>
stamps (not to mention addictive) that you should make a box of your <br/>
own and hide it in shifting locations. You've already got a hiding <br/>
place staked out for its first stop. Please return the one you've moved <br/>
to it's rightful home. Funhog<br/>

It is an active letterbox not abandoned. You should make up a box <br/>
