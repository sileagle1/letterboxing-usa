<b>Coffee Break</b><br/>
Wakefield, Rhode Island<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Laurette<br/>
When: January 14, 2003<br/>
Level: Easy 20 minute walk<br/>
<br/>
Driving Directions: Take Rt. 108 to the intersection of Curtis Corner Road. Go west on Curtis Corner. When you see the CC Middle School (I don't work here), pull into the lot and follow the road around the left of the building past the administration building. Park near the tennis courts.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Across the street from the tennis courts, a path runs east. Take it. Follow the pink as it takes the 2nd right, over some bridges, past lots of briars and through a stone wall. At the, Y go left. 35 paces from the Y, on the right side of the trail stands a<br/>
tree covered in briars, with a hollow at the bottom. It's a good place for a break.<br/>

I gues that will teach me to assume that two pieces of text are the <br/>
same just because their word and character counts are the same!<br/>
