&gt;They cost about $3.50 each, but really, if<br/>
&gt; we put a $5 stamp (or, if hand carved, essentially irreplaceable),<br/>
&gt; a logbook (always irreplaceable), and a $2 ink pad in the box, it<br/>
&gt; makes sense to not skimp on the single most important part of the<br/>
&gt; box.<br/>
<br/>
Is it common for people to put ink pads in their boxes? I haven't been doing<br/>
that.<br/>

out here.  It would get too pricey for me to go to that length and seems<br/>

pretty fast, and I've seen some pretty messy logbooks that were <br/>

&gt;I put an ink pad in all of my letterboxes. The ink color is an integral <br/>
&gt;part<br/>
&gt;of the letterbox theme. This is my touch of creativity. Also, my journal<br/>
