and in good condition by my non-letterboxing parents this weekend in <br/>
Maine. They wrote in the logs and I have the stamp images on the clue-<br/>
sheets here in CT now : ) <br/>
<br/>
I guess we can add an "S" to the PFX for images received as <br/>
Souveniers? LOL<br/>
<br/>
A funny story about the Nubble Light box.... the first day they went <br/>
to try for it the waves were crashing up on shore really high so they <br/>
skipped it. The second time the York (I think thats the town) Fire <br/>
Department and Ambulance services were on scene for a technical <br/>
rescue of some vacationer that had fallen and torn her knee out on <br/>
the rocks. My dad (We're both firefighters and EMTs -- he's a <br/>
Lieutenant) got asked by a firefighter to assist in carrying the <br/>
stokes litter with the lady in it across the rocks and to the waiting <br/>
EMS unit. Kind of funny how those in the trade are always on duty! <br/>

Off to bed.... been at work since 04:00 am!<br/>
