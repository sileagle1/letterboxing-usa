Meet other regional letterboxers, exchange signature stamps, get <br/>
rid of all of those 'pesky' hitchhiker letterboxes, bring your <br/>
house bound letterboxes that you just can't bare to part with but <br/>
would love to share with other letterboxers occasionally, add <br/>
Fudrick's awesome event stamp into your logbook, exchange <br/>
letterboxing/carving helpful hints &amp; ideas. Cap it all off with the <br/>
exquisite potluck that will likely ensue after all of the <br/>
letterboxing festivities. Don't forget to bring the munchkins as <br/>
there is a GREAT playground nearby! If you have a few folks who <br/>
you've been dying to introduce to letterboxing, bring them along, <br/>
too! I'm sure we can get them hooked...<br/>
<br/>
POTLUCK--bring a dish &amp; drinks to share that would feed the folks <br/>
in your party, FOOD!!! Hoopoe is bringing the incredible Deli <br/>
Buster sandwich--don't dare miss it!!!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!<br/>

cookies to finish everything off!***<br/>

Since everyone will be at the Tumwater Historical Park on August <br/>
9th for the South Sound Summer Letterboxing Fest, thought some <br/>
directions might be useful.<br/>
<br/>
If you are NorthBound on I-5, you have the easy route. Take Exit <br/>
103, Deschutes Parkway. At the STOP sign, continue straight <br/>
ahead. <br/>
Go past the entrance to Tumwater Falls Park, you can stop by there <br/>
later. You will pass the Boston Street Bridge (on the right) which <br/>
is closed for reconstruction. You will take the next right, which <br/>
takes you into Tumwater Historical Park. <br/>
<br/>
If you are SouthBound on I-5, it is a little more difficult, so we <br/>
will give you the scenic way. Take Exit 104, which is US 101, <br/>
heading out to the coast. Keep right, you will take the first <br/>
exit, Crosby Blvd/Cooper Point Rd/Capital AutoMall Drive. Turn right <br/>
at the light, turn right at the light (going on two sides of the <br/>
AM/PM). You are on Lakeridge. Take the second left (by Thurston <br/>
County Courthouse Building 4, the two story building with orange <br/>
panels under the windows). You will head down hill after going by <br/>
the entrance to the Thurston County CourthouZ. When you get to the <br/>
bottom of the hill, you are on Deschutes Parkway. Turn right, go <br/>
under the Freeway, don't turn left onto I-5 NB, but turn left at <br/>
the second road, which takes you into the Tumwater Historical Park.<br/>
<br/>
If all goes well, we will be loitering around the picnic tables by <br/>
the playground. You can tell us by our ink-stained fingers.<br/>
<br/>
See you there!!!!<br/>

We're packing up now and all's well here, the rain is already slacking off.  We're bringing ourselves, the food we spoke of (The burgers and dogs to 50), a big tub of potatoes Salad which RayvenMom is making right now, my box of carving/stamping supplies, and our daughter, along with the new, improved, super easy to use, completely portable, darn near back pack able, gas stove I bought last night to cook on.  Woowhee! We're cooking with gas now!!!<br/>
