(Cross-post as appropriate)<br/><br/>
If you have a Yahoo account (for example, you use Yahoo email, clubs, or
groups), be aware that Yahoo has recently set all of your "marketing
preferences" to "Yes".<br/><br/>
This includes the possibility of being contacted by regular mail or by
phone, if you have included that info in your account. It most definitely
includes getting email ads/spam.<br/><br/>
You must change these settings to "No" if you don't want this
to happen.<br/><br/>
Log into Yahoo at
<a eudora="autourl" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/"><u>http://groups.yahoo.com/</u></a><br/><br/>
Click "Account Info" in the upper right
corner<br/><br/>
Click "Edit your marketing preferences" (in the Membership
Information section)<br/>
Â <br/>
Change your settings as needed<br/><br/>
Click "Save changes"<br/><br/>
Just a friendly "heads up" - and it's "fer real" - I
already switched my settings.<br/><br/>
