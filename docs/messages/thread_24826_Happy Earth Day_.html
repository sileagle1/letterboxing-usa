                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings fellow Boxers!  I would think that a lot of us truly enjoy <br/>
The Great Outdoors, and what it brings to our sport.  So here is an <br/>
idea for this Earth Day:<br/>
Take a sturdy garbage bag with you on you next search.  Pick up as much <br/>
litter from the trail and surrounding area as possible, and then <br/>
dispose of it properly when you leave.  It's a wonderful way to keep <br/>
our trails and parks clean.  Also, it's a good excuse to give any <br/>
Muggles that meet you on the way.  (I know it's not original, but it's <br/>
worth saying.)<br/>
<br/>
Take care, and tread lightly.<br/>
We only have one Mother!<br/>
