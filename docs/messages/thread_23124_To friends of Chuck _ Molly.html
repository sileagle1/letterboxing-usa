Molly has a major problem with a toe on her left paw. When we were out letterboxing the nail on her toe broke off the long way and it cut into her foot. We've been back and forth to the vet for three weeks and it just kept getting worse.  There's a bad infection and the possibility of cancer. On Tuesday she'll be having the toe amputated. The vet thinks that she should be ok in a few weeks but if something goes wrong or it takes longer, that's why we're not out boxing. Molly and I are a team and if she can't go, I don't go. So, if you're wondering where we are, we're home and I'm watching a lot of movies with Molly lying beside me. If everything works out, we'll be back again as soon as she's able.<br/>

 I'm so very sorry to hear that Molly is in pain. I know how close the <br/>
two of you are. Truth is, until you wrote about her jumping in a river <br/>
and getting covered in mud I thought she was your wife. We wish her a <br/>
speedy recovery and a return to the trails soon.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>
