El Paso County<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Take Exit 146, Garden of the Gods, from<br/>
I-25.  Head west to 30th Street.  Turn left on 30th<br/>
St.  Turn right on Gateway Road which leads to the<br/>
Garden of the Gods Park.  As you enter the park, park<br/>
in the North Main Parking Lot which is the first one<br/>
you will come to on the left.  <br/>
<br/>
Trail:  Flat for the most part and wheelchair<br/>
accessible.  1-1.5 mile loop to find this<br/>
micromagnetic letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  I'm so much smaller than the incredible rock<br/>
formations surrounding me.  As a result, my LITTLE<br/>
FEET had to sit down and take in all the surroundings,<br/>
incredible rocks, rock climbers, rapelling,<br/>
wildlife...to find me read on.<br/>
<br/>
Start at the Central Garden Trail sign and continue<br/>
down the walkway.  Hang a right at the Signature Rock<br/>
to start the loop.  After 3 rock benches along the<br/>
loop, you will come to a bench unlike any of the<br/>
others.  Take a seat on the southern end and find<br/>
LITTLE FEET hiding in its base.<br/>
