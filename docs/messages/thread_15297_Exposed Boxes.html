the open, sometimes with lid intact, other times with contents strewn <br/>
about. At first, if the box was in the right spot and intact, I <br/>
thought to myself how careless of the previous finder not to rehide <br/>
carefully.  Often, comments in logbooks remark on exposed boxes and <br/>
remind others to hide well.<br/>
  I really think that even if a box is not damaged, just exposed, it <br/>
has been the work of animals.  Yes, sometimes there are chew marks, <br/>
but sometimes there are none.<br/>
   I have vowed to make an extra effort to ensure my hands have no <br/>
scent whatsoever of food on them before handling boxes.  <br/>
     Here's to a cool and colorful autmun of letterboxing!<br/>
