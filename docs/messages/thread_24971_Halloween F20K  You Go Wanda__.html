                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congrats Wanda, on your amazing feat... of course its not just about <br/>
numbers, its about all the amazing places you've been and great people <br/>
you've met. <wink><br/>
<br/>
I would have loved to come to the gathering, wearing my blaze-orange, <br/>
but I was busy down in Milford, CT training new Girl Scout leaders in <br/>
outdoor cooking and other group-camping skills. We did do a piece on <br/>
letterboxing courtesy of Carol ... darn, now I don't remember her <br/>
handle. Carol's troop developed a great program to introduce LBing to <br/>
younger Girl Scouts &amp; it was a lot of fun.<br/>
<br/>
"Senior moments" aside, I'm hoping to get back into the swing of things <br/>
this winter, especially if Bruce's work slows down a little.<br/>
<br/>
Ciao!<br/>
Aili, Bruce, Erin and Cleo<br/>
