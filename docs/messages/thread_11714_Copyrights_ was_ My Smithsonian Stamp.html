&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, I'm jumping into the copyright discussion.  I think we'd all agree<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; when it comes to hiding stamps in the woods, copyright infringement is not<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; problem.  But as I understood the Smithsonian e-mail, it said they needed<br/>
&gt; images that were original.  If the stamp image is substantially altered<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; the clip art (not just by adding other images around it), I think you'd be<br/>
&gt; okay.   But if the artist who created the clip art were to take a look at<br/>
&gt; your stamp (perhaps on display at the Smithsonian) and say, "Hey! That's<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; fox!"--then I'd say you shouldn't submit it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just my opinion.<br/>
