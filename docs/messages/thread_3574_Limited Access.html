<div>Jay       Some of our 
boxes have limited access for various reasons . Gwen's Heron &amp; Tinman , our 
Rogue River boxes , our yet to be posted Santa Cruz Island all require different 
types of access. My vote is to leave them and hopefully things will change for 
the better. Until that time they will be highly desired and prized by those that 
found them.  Don</div>

have another reason for wanting to retire them.<br/>

Every box has accessibility limits--even if it is just distance away <br/>
from one's residence. Some people can't make the difficult hikes.<br/>
