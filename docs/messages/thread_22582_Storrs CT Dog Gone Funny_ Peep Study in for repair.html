                    <div class="plaintext-content">Carolyn's "Dog Gone Funny" and "Peep Study" Tolland County, Storrs, CT are temporarily closed while they are being repaired. When they are returned to service they will be the same box and stamp (NOT a new find for those that already have them) but will have modified clues and slightly different hiding places. Will get them back in service as quickly as possible.....Chuck and Molly<br/>
