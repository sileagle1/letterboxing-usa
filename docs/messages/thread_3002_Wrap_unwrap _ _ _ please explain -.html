                    <div class="plaintext-content">   We seem to be dealing with the nitty-gritty of Talk-list usage, <br/>
and now I have a question of my own.  Often you see the text with the <br/>
original format chopped into full and partial lines . . . very <br/>
difficult to read, as well as unattractive.  I realize that "wrap" <br/>
and "unwrap" are involved here, but don't know just how.  Is the <br/>
sender responsible for choosing the correct format (clicking on the <br/>
various 'wrap' or 'unwrap' buttons) in order to prevent this from <br/>
happening - either in the text of your own message or that to which <br/>
you may be replying ?  A little help, please . . <br/>
   Am sending this with the 'Wrap message text' at the bottom checked <br/>
(this seems to be the default mode).<br/>
