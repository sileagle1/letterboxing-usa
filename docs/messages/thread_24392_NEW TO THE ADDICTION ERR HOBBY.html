may.To date <br/>
we have found 9 boxes I am on vacation ths week and spent almoost 2<br/>
full days <br/>
boxing she loves it (me too) The excitement of finding that box is the<br/>
best. I <br/>
was a little unsure of my compas abilities (I am heavily involved in<br/>
Scouts)Well <br/>
she stepped up and made sure I was doing it right. LOL we have to<br/>
parks that we <br/>
have been to a million times and never knew what adventures they held.<br/>
We hav <br/>
also discovered areas that we really never explored before. I am<br/>
planning on <br/>
planting my first box soon any hint or tips for a neebie?<br/>
thanks to all you great boxers out there for planting boxes and<br/>
getting me <br/>
hooked on this great activity <br/>
