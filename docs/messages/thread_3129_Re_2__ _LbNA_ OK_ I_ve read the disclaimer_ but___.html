Hi Don<br/>
<br/>
Love the idea about a Letterboxing story ..<br/>
<br/>
You suggest a tale of a serial killer and a remote location variant using<br/>
a Letterboxing twist and I suggest why not locate it in the home of<br/>
Letterboxing ..Dartmoor ?...and maybe a gothic horror (Elm Street type)<br/>
setting ...and of course you must have a good detective to solve it ?<br/>
<br/>
It's been done !<br/>
<br/>
It's called "Hound of The Baskervilles"<br/>
The author is Arthur Conan Doyle<br/>
The detective is Sherlock Holmes.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is that new Don !  <g><br/>
<br/>
"A C D" was a letterboxer you see, he had the same idea...<br/>
<br/>
But it is remake season at the movies ..so why not go for it ?<br/>
<br/>
Jurasic Park 3, Crocodile Dundee 3, Planet of the Apes (er 27?) so why not<br/>
Hound of The Baskervilles 2002 ?  <lol><br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
Graham Howard<br/>
The Moorland Wizard <br/>
<br/>
PS I hear they are making Titanic II  ..that really spooks me ..Will this<br/>
one arrive then ?<br/>
<br/>
Ooops no, they already did that in Ghostbusters ...Oh dear, do I spend too<br/>
much time at the movies <roflol><br/>
<br/>
PPS...Some Letterboxing Film titles<br/>
<br/>
The Rock<br/>
The Trail of "The Lonesome Pine Letterbox"<br/>
The 39 Steps <br/>
Clueless in Seatle<br/>
The Loneliness of the Long Distance Letterboxer<br/>
Eight and a half (Well we almost found that last one !)<br/>
Garden Fete (F8 !)<br/>
Farenheit 451 degrees<br/>
Message in a Bottle<br/>
<br/>
or perhaps my favourite...with cryptic clues !<br/>
<br/>
Mission Impossible (!)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Tim...I have been thinking.... if I were to decide to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;put together a book of letterboxing stories, where<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;would I stand, in terms of using other people's<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;stories in a perhaps profitable venture?  Would I need<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;to get their permission?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Yes.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;  If so, how binding would it<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;be?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by this.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;  I am working on a fiction novel at this time, so<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;my stuff is my own.  I'd love to do a letterboxing<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;book full of stories from those of us who may have had<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;an exciting, scary, whatever adventure while planting<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;and/or finding.  However, I am wondering..... what are<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;your thoughts on this?  Thanks, Linda<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; It sounds like a fairly straightforward act of journalism. You're simply<br/>
&gt;&gt; asking people if they'll tell you a story and give you premission to<br/>
&gt;print<br/>
&gt;&gt; it. Some may ask for names to be changed. It's unlikely to raise any<br/>
&gt;great<br/>
&gt;&gt; ethical issues, I'd say, as long as they are fully informed about what<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;&gt; intend to do with their words. A lawyer would probably advise you to<br/>
&gt;get a<br/>
&gt;&gt; signed release from all concerned, but frankly, if they don't want you<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;&gt; use their story, they won't tell it to you.<br/>
