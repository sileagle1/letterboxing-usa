                    <div class="plaintext-content">Riding our bikes thru Durham yesterday and stopped in to this little <br/>
cafe for an espresso and snack. Started talking to this couple from <br/>
Middlefield who had two small girls ages 9 and 4. Got to the topic <br/>
of hiking and then lettrboxing. They all knew about letterboxing so <br/>
I asked them if they knew that there was a letterbox within 15 feet <br/>
of where they were sitting. Their eyes grew large and started to <br/>
look around them. i gave them a hint that it wasnt outside. They <br/>
rushed into the cafe and started to look. One more little hint and <br/>
they were hot on the trail. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatly, the box turned up missing except for the top page of <br/>
the book showing the would be stamp and the sheets explaining all <br/>
about letterboxing. A quick query to the person behind the counter <br/>
turned up astonishment at the fact that the box was not there.<br/>
<br/>
The girls were'nt too disappointed, they had lunch waiting for them <br/>
and a day full of jumping in piles of leaves and other adventures.<br/>
<br/>
So, the box is def. missing. I first enjoyed this box along with <br/>
Oma's Outlook a few years back with my three so this box will be <br/>
sorely missed.<br/>
