Apparently the National Park Service is discussing with<br/>
the geocaching community the possibility (likelyhood) that<br/>
geocaching is illegal in national parks.  The reasons for the<br/>
NPS's position probably also make letterboxing illegal in <br/>
national parks.<br/>
<br/>
So, make sure your letterboxes comply with all local rules<br/>
laws, customs, respect the environment, etc.  If you have any <br/>
doubts, check with the landowners or managers.  The webmasters do <br/>
not vet clues for suitability; it is not possible to do so.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, this is all hearsay.  No one from the NPS has personally <br/>
contacted me about this (or the webmaster comment addy AFAIK), <br/>
and possibly never will.  I have removed my boxes from Valley <br/>
Forge NHP, however, and I encourage you, if you have placed a <br/>
box in a national park (or anywhere else questionable), to <br/>
consider doing so yourself or asking the NPS or park about it.<br/>
<br/>
I am considering making my Valley Forge boxes virtual -- solve the<br/>
clues -- e-mail me their location (either marked on a map, gps, or<br/>
photos) -- and if you are right, I'll send you the scan of the stamp<br/>
image.  I sure hope its not illegal to walk to these locations :-)<br/>

I think they over-reacting a bit.  I'd be interested to see if I get a<br/>
response.  the illegality of letterboxing is pretty danged trivial.  I would<br/>
think that the NPS has bigger fish to fry.<br/>

Below are two of the posts from the geocaching email list which address <br/>
this issue. (Apologies for the duplication to those who subscribe to that <br/>
list already.) As geocaching grows it seems that letterboxing will be <br/>
lumped in with it for many land managers (not only NPS ones, either). It's <br/>
likely that the days of our obscurity are vanishing rapidly. Apparently the <br/>
NPS is now actively monitoring the LbNA website and removing what they <br/>
consider to be "abandoned property". The first post below states that "The <br/>
web site showed the location of at least two letterboxes in parks. The <br/>
parks have been notified...."<br/>
The tone of the report does not sound promising either as it states that <br/>
"geocaching has and can cause [damage] to historic, archeological and <br/>
natural sites." Not "might have" or "may", but "has".<br/>

Subject: Geocaching in NPS Morning Report<br/>
<br/>
Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
I am the editor at Outside magazine that assigned our January story about<br/>
Geocaching. I have been following the NPS discussion and thought you might<br/>
all be interested in this. It comes from the "Morning Report" that is<br/>
emailed to all regional offices and headquarters of National Parks<br/>
nationwide.<br/>
<br/>
-James Glave<br/>
<br/>
Geocaching - There is a new web-based activity called geocaching that has<br/>
affected several National Park Service areas. The Ranger Activities Division<br/>
asked Olympic NP SA Mike Butler to investigate. Here's his report:<br/>
Geocaching is an activity in which participants hide a cache and take a<br/>
position at the location using a GPS receiver. The position is then<br/>
published on the group's web site with an invitation to search for the<br/>
"treasure." Caches often contain a notebook or log book and something the<br/>
finder may take. The finder is asked to put another item in the cache for<br/>
others to discover and will often report the find on the web site. Several<br/>
caches have been found in National Park Service areas. The webmaster for the<br/>
site (www.geocaching.com) has been contacted. He was very surprised that<br/>
geocaching is illegal in NPS areas, and understood NPS concerns about the<br/>
damage geocaching has and can cause to historic, archeological and natural<br/>
sites. He agreed to work with the Service to discourage further geocaching<br/>
activities in parks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Two related activities were also discovered.<br/>
Letterboxing (www.letterboxing.org) is a phenomenon similar to geocaching in<br/>
that a player takes directions from a web site and uses those directions to<br/>
find a hidden object. In letterboxing, the directions come in the form of a<br/>
riddle and the hidden object is a stamp which the finder can use to stamp a<br/>
piece of paper to prove that he has visited the site. The web site showed<br/>
the location of at least two letterboxes in parks. The parks have been<br/>
notified, but the Service has not yet contacted the webmaster or game<br/>
managers. The Degree Confluence Project (www.confluence.org) is another<br/>
web-based activity where people try to visit various latitude and longitude<br/>
integer degree intersections and report their findings on the web site. In<br/>
this case, however, no objects are placed in the ground, and there are no<br/>
apparent regulatory violations in areas where cross-country travel is<br/>
allowed or where the confluence is not on a protected site. There has been<br/>
no attempt to contact the project organizers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Additional comments referring to sections of the Code of Federal<br/>
Regulations: The depositing of the cache, be it a bucket or other type of<br/>
container, could be in violation of a few regulations like digging up plants<br/>
if it was being buried. Additionally, it is against regulations to leave<br/>
property unattended for more than 24 hours without it being subject to<br/>
impoundment.  If people are "hunting" for something, it could certainly take<br/>
more than 24 hours to find.  Lastly, some areas are closed to off-trail<br/>
hiking which could prohibit someone from going off trail to place or<br/>
retrieve a cache.<br/>

Jeremy, et al,<br/>
<br/>
Unsure if you've seen this cache log post, but it appears the NPS rangers<br/>
are monitoring the site for caches placed within their jurisdictions and<br/>
removing them when found. To their credit, they are at least notifying the<br/>
cache owners and site admins (Jeremy) so that appropriate action can be<br/>
taken to remove the listing and retrieve the cache to be replaced somewhere<br/>
more appropriate.<br/>

  Glider's March 17th comments are correct. It is not legal to leave<br/>
  geocaches inside units of the National Park System. As such, the Fossil<br/>
  Beds Cache was located and removed by park staff on 03/15/01. So don't go<br/>
  look for it as you'd be wasting your time. But please do come to the park<br/>
  and enjoy it as Congress intended. Greg (Chilcog), please call 541-987-2333<br/>
  and ask for the Chief Ranger's office to arrange to come out and pick up<br/>
  your cache materials. No citations at this point, just a friendly warning<br/>
  with a short explanation. Geocaching webmaster, please remove the Fossil<br/>
  Beds Cache from your website as it no longer exists. Thanks, JODA Ranger<br/>

I'm going to stretch a little beyond what I'm sure is truth here, so maybe someone listening in in the UK can help. My impression is that the concept of a National Park in the UK is not the same as in the US. I think I read somewhere, for example, that grazing is allowed on Dartmoor. You would never find cattle or sheep grazing (legally) in the US National Parks, unless as part of an interpretive demonstration at one of the smaller, less-wild parks. Of course you do often find packstock (horses, mules, llamas) grazing, but not roaming at will. <br/>
<br/>
One of the most fundamental concepts of National Parks in the US is that they be kept as natural as possible. EVERYthing is protected in US National Parks. If you run off with a pine cone or a pebble as a souvenir, you're breaking the law. I think there's an exception for berries, and maybe edible mushrooms. Otherwise, visitors are supposed to leave the park as undisturbed as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Because UK National Parks are (if I'm right about this) much less stringently protected, it's not inconsistent or anomalous that letterboxing would be accepted there but prohibited here in the US.<br/>

I think we can all agree that as conscientious letterboxers we adhere to the<br/>
"spirit" of this concept.  Beyond protecting the land, the other half of the<br/>
National Park Service mission is "to provide for the enjoyment of the same<br/>
in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the<br/>
enjoyment of future generations."  I'm straining hard to understand how<br/>
letterboxing strays very far from falling within the goals of the NPS.<br/>
The overall impact of even a few HUNDRED rubbermaid sandwich keepers<br/>
carefully hidden over the 80.7 million acres of NPS controlled land is at<br/>
best negligible.<br/>
<br/>
We could entertain an interesting debate on the merits of allowing souvenir<br/>
villages on National Park property, yet disallowing a harmless activity like<br/>
letterboxing.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is a potential problem which has been discussed way back in the <br/>
very first days of letterboxing in the US. The end result was (by <br/>
lack of doing anything else) that people hid boxes and waited to see <br/>
if it was going to be a problem. It took a long time, but it appears <br/>
the problem has come to roost. I don't know what the answer is. I <br/>
expect that it will only become a bigger issue.<br/>
<br/>
Unless the NPS is persuaded that there is a better good in <br/>
letterboxing, I expect that other government lands will eventually <br/>
follow (e.g. state parks). I can't see that private lands will be an <br/>
option in most cases. Either letterboxing will have to adapt in some <br/>
way that I cannot currently imagine being popular (such as the <br/>
virtual box Randy mentioned) or it will have to go underground and <br/>
accept the illegitimacy of it's existence.<br/>
<br/>
I am not  optimistic we could change the government view on this <br/>
subject but I suppose it is worth a try. Anybody out there contribute <br/>
a lot on money to George  W. and have some favors to call in? ;-)<br/>

Just a reminder that I was successful last year in getting permission from<br/>
the US Forest Service to place letterboxes on National Forest land. I say<br/>
that not as self-congratulation, but to give credit to an enlightened local<br/>
Forest Supervisor, and to encourage others to try asking, explaining, and<br/>

That is good news. I suppose that they are less strict with land <br/>
where they allow much more destructive practices such as logging and <br/>
hunting. I wonder if ultimately the issue will be decided on local <br/>
forest supervisor basis or there will be some higher level decision. <br/>
I fear the latter.  Down here in Florida the Ocala National Forest is <br/>
very large and presents some good opportunity for letterboxing. Next <br/>
time I am up there I will attempt to find out who would be the <br/>
appropriate person to contact about the issue.<br/>

I guess if you give people an inch, they'll take a mile, and maybe that<br/>
is what the park service is worried about.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone ought to do some PR work and talk to someone who works on<br/>
policy for the NPS and see if we can get this ruling changed.  (It<br/>
sounds like they may contact one of the webmasters).  Geocaching seems<br/>
like a more major thing and letterboxing is less intrusive, as far as I<br/>
can tell.  Still, you aren't leaving without a trace and that must be<br/>
what their beef is.  Also, they may think we're burying things or<br/>
destroying habitat or something to place these, which we aren't doing.<br/>
Perhaps we need to set them straight.<br/>

The Gallatin National Forest folks I worked with were easily reassured that I wasn't going to bury anything. It had in fact been a major concern of theirs in reviewing my request. <br/>
<br/>
At least as significant a worry for them, though, was that the boxes would be placed in such a way that seekers would cut unwanted new trails through fragile soils and/or vegetation. For that reason all the boxes I planted are accessible without departing from the trail, or, if a departure is required, the path is over bare rock. That was acceptable to the USFS people. <br/>
<br/>
Out west here, at least -- and I think this is true for the Smokies and Mammoth Cave -- the National Parks are ringed by National Forest land. If letterboxing is excluded from the Parks, and if we maintain good relations with the Forest Service, letterboxers should be able to take advantage of the popularity and amenities of the Parks by placing boxes on the nearby National Forest properties. The secondary benefit of this is introducing people to the much-less-crowded, but often equally beautiful lands peripheral to the Parks. For example, I had a great hike to gorgeous little Grizzly Lake last summer in the Shoshone National Forest just up the road from Grand Teton National Park's crowded Gros Ventre campground. (No letterbox there -- yet!)<br/>
