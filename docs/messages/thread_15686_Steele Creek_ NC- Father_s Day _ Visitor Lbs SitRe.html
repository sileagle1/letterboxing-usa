Well, I got back out to the site of the Father's Day Lb today.. I had taken the two books that were soaking wet, brought them home and dried them out.... most of the pages were salvagable, and nearly all readable, but blurry.<br/>
I put them in an airtight container and then put that in a ziplock baggie.  I put a pencil in with a fresh notebook, labled "Father's Day Book 3".  I also replaced the cracked container.  Put the placer's stamp in the new container along with all the other stuff. The description originally says "white container" and this is now no longer true.  <br/>
<br/>
This park is also the same area that the Visitor Lb is placed although I could not find it again today.  I am a  beginner but I really exhausted the possiblities of the hints that go with this box.  Could the placer contact me?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks bunches,<br/>
