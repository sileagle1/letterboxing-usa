Hey, Lucy, email me about where in NC you are.  I forgot!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I also initiated my roving event stamp to comemorate my historic adventure.  It's only good for a limited time, though.  It was officially introduced to the world April 16, my first day on the trail.  The stamp will be discontinued the last day I leave the trail which is who knows when.  Get it now before it's too late! =)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone checks the registers at the shelters, I've been signing my entries with my signature stamp, a green turtle.  Look for it!  =)<br/>

PS. Haven't you folks in NC ever heard of switchbacks?!!!  Sheeze!<br/>

I think that would be a great idea!  If he is coming to the Harper's Ferry <br/>

something and have an exchange frenzy.  Anyone else interested?  Mother of <br/>

Scarab and Newbi better attended so Ryan doesn't feel henpecked!<br/>
     So far the dates picked for Ryan's EDA are:<br/>
     Hiker     June 10<br/>
     Psychomommy    13<br/>
     Tammy ADG#1    14<br/>
     Sam I AM       15<br/>
  Place your bets: wages are up to individuals, and only if you feel <br/>

     Psychomommy<br/>
