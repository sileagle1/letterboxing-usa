replaced the plastic bag on the first box to prevent any further <br/>

unreadable.  The ink pad in the first box is so wet it is better not <br/>
used at it will saturate your journal.  And worst of all, the stamp <br/>
in the third box is missing and has been missing for over 18 months.  <br/>
That box is pretty well trashed anyway.<br/>

I didn't have time to get to the fourth box but my guess is it's <br/>
condition will be consistent with the other three.<br/>

Wish I'd known you were going.  I need to drag Dan out to LB more often.<br/>

<br/>
Fast Passage and Fort Adams were pretty beat up when Danny and I went there<br/>
about a month ago, and we replaced some bags and boxes.  The coastal boxes<br/>
take quite a beating from the weather.  When we go out to do more on<br/>
Aquidneck Island, we'll bring more fresh boxes and baggies along and try to<br/>
help maintain these boxes for the Drew clan.<br/>

<br/>
If we go and find this one, I'll let you know.<br/>
<br/>
This coming weekend we intend to do the second half of Canonchet's Waters.<br/>
I have been to the Ashville Pond box twice, and all was well, but on my<br/>
first trip to the Long Pond box, it was nowhere to be found, and I'm pretty<br/>
sure we were looking in the right spot.  Even though I'm fairly certain it's<br/>
missing (and the clue page notes this), I want to return. It's a beautiful<br/>
area!  Maybe we'll find the box thrown somewhere or maybe I was in the wrong<br/>
spot the first time.  Want to join us if we go?  It would most likely be<br/>
Sunday.  If so, please email me.<br/>

the years), thank you very much for your time and expense in fixing <br/>
up our letterboxes. Since we don't live and work in Newport [RI] any <br/>
more, lots of those letterboxes have fallen into disarry. Ben/Fur <br/>
have even made us a replacement stamp for the one that has been <br/>
missing (now where is that danged thing?).<br/>
<br/>
We still love Newport best of all and spend as much time as possible <br/>
there, but it's mostly out on the bay sailing J105s. We'd love to <br/>
sink a letterbox by the nun buoy at the harbor's entrance...<br/>
