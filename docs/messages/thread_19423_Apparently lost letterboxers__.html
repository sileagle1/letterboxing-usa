Anyone heard from TeamGreenDragon lately??  <br/>
<br/>
I'm from the SE corner of Massachusetts and have done lots of their <br/>
boxes.  Wanting to introduce someone new to the sport, I went to re-<br/>
print some clues that I've already done(I want to make sure that <br/>
these people find what they're looking for!! <g>), and it seems as <br/>
if all of their clues have been pulled from the LbNA website!  As <br/>
the stamps are usually phenomenal, this is very sad....does anyone <br/>
know what's up?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help,<br/>
Kerri<br/>
