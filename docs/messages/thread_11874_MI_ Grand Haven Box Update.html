                    <div class="plaintext-content">Went out today and put the boxes at Duncan Woods back in place, <br/>
including replacing the missing Tic-Tac-Toe box.  Since the hiding <br/>
spot was compromised, I rehid it in a slightly different place, so <br/>
the clues have been changed just a bit at the end.<br/>
<br/>
Also checked on the Words in the Woods series of boxes at Hofma Park <br/>
and was happy to see that the boxes made it through the winter fairly <br/>
well.  One of the boxes, "Beauty of Dreams" is missing, and <br/>
unfortunately it appears the cuckoo clue was in this box at the time <br/>
it disappeared as I checked all of the boxes and didn't come across <br/>
it.  I have removed the cuckoo box while I rewrite the clue, so if <br/>
you got a copy of it previously, you will have to wait a bit to look <br/>
for it.<br/>
<br/>
I was a little disappointed to find that some of the boxes had been <br/>
repackaged rather carelessly (i.e. outer plastic bag just wadded up <br/>
inside) and put back into the hiding place without being covered.  I <br/>
also want to mention that if you are looking for a box and are fairly <br/>
certain that you have the right place, but no box...  please don't <br/>
tear up the area looking for it.  At the spot where the missing box <br/>
should have been, the entire log pile had been strewn about and small <br/>
holes dug in the dirt with the toe end of a shoe.  It is possible <br/>
that whomever vandalized the box did this, but more likely it was <br/>
somebody looking for the box and frustrated at not being able to find <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing, and I'm sorry if I sound like I'm bitching, but if <br/>
you use messy ink, please have something with you to wipe the stamp <br/>
off when you are finished.  At a couple of the boxes, the log book <br/>
showed the last log in to be over 3 months ago, and the stamp was <br/>
still a wet, sticky mess of red ink, as was the entire inside of the <br/>
baggie the stamp was in.<br/>
<br/>
On the bright side...  several of the hiding spots had definitely <br/>
seen water over the past few months, but the contents of all boxes <br/>
were neat and dry, thanks to use of an inner freezer bag.<br/>
<br/>
I will be replacing the missing box and the cuckoo clue and box <br/>
within the next couple of weeks.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">After a thorough search of the area today, I regret to conclude that <br/>
the Grand Haven lighthouse box is indeed missing.  This was one of <br/>
the two boxes I placed on my first letterbox planting excursion just <br/>
shy of a year ago, and has been one of the most visited Grand Haven <br/>
boxes since then, so I am sad to see that it has come up missing.  I <br/>
will carve up a new stamp and replace this box within the next week <br/>
or so.  Location and clues will be different, so it will be a new <br/>
find for everyone who has already visited.  Thanks Tom and Jill for <br/>
the heads up on this one.<br/>
<br/>
Also checked on the boxes at Mulligan's Hollow after receiving an e-<br/>
mail about possible missing boxes, and am happy to report all boxes <br/>
there are safe and sound.<br/>
