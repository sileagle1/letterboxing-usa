I hate to see us over react and make more of this than it is. It's really  <br/>
okay to discuss responsible letterboxing here in public. By removing all the  <br/>

well meaning.<br/>

You wouldn't believe how much stuff like this land manager  complaint goes on <br/>
behind the scenes at LbNA, or how much flak the people at  letterboxing.org <br/>
put up with to ensure that the website for our beloved past  time is completely <br/>

<br/>
It's okay to talk about these things together as a community. Please don't  <br/>

You probably wouldn't want to see what was in our mailbox today from a  <br/>

There is no problem in the discussion, where the real problem lies is <br/>
when people do not have the full information in what is being discussed.<br/>
<br/>
It is perfectly fine to discuss where and how a box should be planted. <br/>
What is not fine is to use an inaccurate example in the discussion <br/>
without full disclosure, and that is what you did.<br/>
<br/>
It would be a completely different matter to some of us had you followed <br/>
up saying something along the lines of the box originally having <br/>
permission, but was not maintained and the land changed hands. Instead <br/>
you just threw it out there and left it blowing in the wind.<br/>
<br/>
The matter has gone from what kind of emails you get at the site to you <br/>
not giving the full information needed to let people know what is really <br/>
being talked about, and in the process you unintentionally insulted someone.<br/>

Her Ladyship fails to understand why you are distracting from the<br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">Her Ladyship would like to present a true tale of her experiences at<br/>
the Manor that seems an apt parable for the state of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Her Ladyship, as a delicate young nymph, moved into the old stone<br/>
country estate known as Prisspott Manor. Located in the rolling<br/>
pastures and wooded glens of the Blue Ridge foothills, Prisspott Manor<br/>
was a great gray lady of native limestone and drafty eaves. Like any<br/>
great lady Prisspott Manor was imposing but showing it's age around<br/>
the edges; just as one might see the occasional wisp of hair that is<br/>
no longer held as tightly in place in the coif of a mature lady so the<br/>
manor had the occasional loose board at the eaves. <br/>
<br/>
For several years it was an idyllic existence, ensconced as her<br/>
Ladyship was, in in the warm and comforting glow of the Manor's<br/>
hearth; a West Virginian Vesta, safe from the small fauna that shared<br/>
the provincial landscape. How fortunate her Ladyship thought herself<br/>
to be free of the annoyance of the small rodents whith which one would<br/>
expect to have a chance encounter in such a country setting. For some<br/>
time her Ladyship was untroubled by any scurrying in the walls or<br/>
nibbling on the grain stores for unbeknownst to her the Manor was<br/>
inhabited by a stealthy tenant who had the good sense to remain silent<br/>
and never to show it's self to the Lady of the manor. <br/>
<br/>
With time comes complacency and one day her Ladyship discovered the<br/>
silent sentry that kept the vermin at bay; a large and black snake,<br/>
failing to make sufficient haste, slithered right up the side of the<br/>
manor clinging in the chinks between the stones disappearing into the<br/>
attic through a loose board in the eaves. Her Ladyship paused for<br/>
reflection unhampered by panic through her familiarity with the habits<br/>
and temperament of the many creatures of the surrounding field and<br/>
dale and realized that her silent guest had for years remained both<br/>
invisible and diligent. Thus an arrangement developed that brought her<br/>
Ladyship a blissful vermin-free contentment. The guest was allowed to<br/>
come and go at will enjoying the blessing of free will and liberty<br/>
that sweetens our miserable time on earth. If there were to be guests<br/>
in the Manors dark recesses, and there surely would be, then her<br/>
Ladyship reasoned that this quiet and unassuming guest was preferred. <br/>
<br/>
For years never a trace of this visitor was left and for a time no<br/>
trace would be seen but, as will happen, this easy coexistence lead<br/>
the visitor to become more and more brazen and gradually to invite<br/>
guest of his own. At first her Ladyship merely had to show her<br/>
displeasure at the encounter and for a time they would again forget<br/>
each other's existence. While the guest had been tolerated as long as<br/>
it left to trace it was not welcome showing it's self with increasing<br/>
frequency and her Ladyship had come to believe that it was not always<br/>
the same individual. <br/>
<br/>
Soon these guests became recalcitrant to her Ladyships efforts to<br/>
encourage them to find other lodgings and the guest began expressing<br/>
their displeasure to her Ladyship with increasing venom, often raring<br/>
up and hissing their protest directly at her Ladyship. Such<br/>
unassailable confidence began to invite her Ladyship's retribution. <br/>
<br/>
A thorough inspection of the Manor reveled that the silent tenant had<br/>
abused her Ladyship's indulgence and had created a large colony<br/>
throughout the upper reaches of the Manor. Eviction proceedings were<br/>
begun at once. Years of tolerance lead the creatures to develop a<br/>
sense of entitlement and they resisted her Ladyship's demand to vacate<br/>
most vehemently but divine right was on her Ladyship's side and such<br/>
unabashed presumptuousness, such self-righteous resistance, the<br/>
unfounded and ill-reasoned sense of entitlement were given short<br/>
shrift and Saint Patrick was visited upon their prideful souls. The<br/>
guest, and all his kind, were dispatched to meet the maker to whom<br/>
their cries of repentance came too late. For their sins of pride and<br/>
greed they were punished and their sense of entitlement slipped away<br/>
as easily as their soul slipped the bounds of the mortal coil. <br/>
<br/>
But that wasn't the end. With the ill-mannered guests gone the mice<br/>
arrived, even more loutish and unwelcome a guest by far. Now it was<br/>
only the mice that were happy, her Ladyship was plagued by their<br/>
scurrying and the damage done by their incessant gnawing and stealing<br/>
of food and the snakes, well, the snakes were feeling no emotion<br/>
anymore. This unhappy turn of events lead to a fortification of the<br/>
manor against any guests, the eaves were boarded up, holes plugged and<br/>
cracks filled until her Ladyship was hermetically sealed inside the<br/>
manor. <br/>
<br/>
Last to arrive was an innocent looking feline with a wild streak who<br/>
was plucked from a care-free, libertine life and imprisoned in the<br/>
manor. There it lead a predictable existence and performed it's sentry<br/>
duty against any unwanted vermin well but it still did not enjoy the<br/>
blessings of liberty that her Ladyship's first guest was granted lest<br/>
it entice more of it's kind and her Ladyship found herself the uneasy<br/>
jailer of this otherwise innocent animal who surely longed to roam<br/>
free as it had in youth but now suffered the misery of dull routine<br/>
with only the occasional unwanted guest upon which to exercise it's<br/>
frustration.<br/>

My experience is that it depends!  We have been given permission<br/>
recently to plant at an Audubon trail here in Massachusetts without any<br/>
problem at all, and we know there are at least four other boxes planted<br/>
in this large conservation area!  So, if you ask, they may let you. <br/>
Just be careful, do box maintenance, and be a friend!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Letterboxes are allowed, or at least are not outlawed in all <br/>
state <br/>
&gt; parks In<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oregon we can still plant in state parks, in the national forest, <br/>
&gt; and BLM<br/>
&gt; &gt; land. Hmmm, we've got millions of acres still to plant in. Come <br/>
on <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In my opinion, yes. Letterboxing isn't allowed on private <br/>
property <br/>
&gt; (mostly,<br/>
&gt; &gt; unless you get permission I mean), it isn't allowed in most <br/>
&gt; federal and<br/>
&gt; &gt; state parks (right?) and many city parks or Audubon owned kind of <br/>
&gt; parks<br/>
&gt; &gt; don't want them either all because we will trample the precious <br/>
&gt; grounds etc,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it isn't allowed on property that the public has access to like <br/>
&gt; parking lots<br/>
&gt; &gt; because people might think it's a bomb, it isn't allowed in <br/>
&gt; cemetaries (or<br/>
&gt; &gt; for those it is allowed in, some people feel it's not "right" to <br/>
&gt; put them<br/>
&gt; &gt; there).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am quickly running out of "legal, legit, morally ok" places <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; possibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; can have letterboxes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Really, where can we put them? What is left?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; RIFamily<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; regarding<br/>
&gt; &gt; Will the outcome<br/>
&gt; &gt; be total annihilation of letterboxes with ensuing fortification <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; isolation of the beautiful and inviting locations we had been <br/>
&gt; allowed<br/>
&gt; &gt; to enjoy as we desired?<br/>
