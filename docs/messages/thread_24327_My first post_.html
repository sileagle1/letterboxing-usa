<br/>
This is my first post in this group and I could probably be the first <br/>
person that has ever posted without having a stamp, or finding a <br/>
letter box yet!  Forgive me...I'm just excited.  ha...<br/>
<br/>
I live in Bellingham, WA which is about 90 miles north of Seattle and <br/>
my sister told me about letterboxing a few days ago.  I am really <br/>
excited to start this adventure/hobby/past time.  I am going to try <br/>
and carve my stamp tomorrow and apparantly there is a letterbox about <br/>
a block from my house!  Guess where I'm heading first?<br/>
<br/>
I do have a question about protocol.  I guess it's more about what is <br/>
the recommended thing to do and I'm guessing the answer is <br/>
probably "however you want to do it" but I'll ask anyway.  After <br/>
finding a letterbox and stamping my own book, is there a norm on how <br/>
to do it properly?  I found a nice 4x6 sketch pad  book that is acid <br/>
free and I can probably fit 2-3 different stamps/letterbox's on it.  <br/>
I am the type of person that would like to make a note or two about <br/>
the weather, whether the hike was difficult or not, any snake bites <br/>
lol, stuff like that.  I'm assuming that one puts the location along <br/>
with the name of the letter box too?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks all and I look forward to joining you on this adventure!<br/>

I love it when finders leaves note only their trailname and the date but a note about their experience while finding the letterbox. I think a lot of letterboxers worry about taking too much room up in the logbook - if you find one of mine, take as much room as you need (but I'd appreciate an email if the logbook gets down to one empty page, then I'll go out and replace it asap). <br/>
<br/>
  Oh wait, you're talking about your own personal logbook right? Not the letterbox's logbook? Anyway I still say put a note in the letterbox's notebook too. <br/>

<br/>
And welcome to LbNA!!! :D  I, too, am orignally from Bellingham - now transplanted to Arizona (Tucson, more specifically).  What part of Bellingham are you in?  My parents still have a house over by Whatcom Falls and there is a letterbox in there, which I have yet to find.  Fellow Letterboxers have done a great job about the placement of letterboxes up in and around town.  You know as well as anyone that you catch Larrabee at low tide, the walks on the beach are awesome, especially when you can see the starfish, and there are a few letterboxes out Larrabee way.  <br/>
<br/>
My best friend introduced me to Letterboxing and I wasn't sure how things should be done, either, but I am one of those people, too.  I started making notes of the weather, impressions of the area I was in, etc.  I would make similar notes in the log book that I stamped - granted, there was space available.  My first log book was a tiny thing - I have now "graduated" to a sketch book and there is more room to write more thoughts.  There is no right or wrong way to stamp your very own log book.  That's the beauty of letterboxing is that you let creativity guide you.  You make your log book your own.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Another great website that you may want to check out, if you haven't already done so, is www.atlasquest.com.  Atlas Quest and LbNA - very smilar.  And since you are so close to BC, you can always venture out and get those ones close by, like in Abbotsford, Langley, Aldergrove, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Anytime you feel like conversing outside of here, you can always get me at this email address or you can find me under "AZJokester" on Atlas Quest.<br/>
<br/>
Take care and have fun!! :D<br/>

They keep telling us to get in touch with our bodies. Mine isn't all that communicative but I heard from it the other day after I said, "Body, how'd you like to go to the six o'clock class in vigorous toning?" Clear as a bell my body said, "Listen fatty....do it and die."<br/>

new bird or watching 3 deer for 20 minutes huffing and stomping to try <br/>

putting this info in the LB log book -- I was always concerned with <br/>
trying to conserve space for the person.  I could see how that would <br/>
make their log book more interesting when they recover it.  Thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">you were absolutely right. whatever works for you. We (JARs of clay) always travel together but each have our own books and started with small journals (the 4x6) only to have realized we like journaling and space for the LARGER stamps that are definitely out there (the 4x6 ones!) so we now each have a 9x12 sketch book. I wouldn't absolutely count on the 4x6 book holding more than 2-3 stamps per page and know it will occasionally only fit one...there are stamps that large out there, not as many as the smaller ones but there definitely are. Ultimately it boils down to whatever you're willing to carry as you walk or hike or jump in and out of your car. Good luck and happy hunting!
