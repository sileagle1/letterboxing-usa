                    <html><body><p>Hey OR folks,</p>
<p>Well this weekend was a busy one for me. I set out and plantedÂ my boxes for the gathering (Goofy Pub Names) and also checked on the Canadian Walk Mystery boxes....I wanted to see how the nettles were and they have grown up some so do wear gloves and longer pants to get them. But they are all alive and well. The Canadian Hitch Hiker however has moved on. </p>
<p>I also went out and nabbed box one of the Oxbow Park boxes but no matter how much more I crawled around on my knees I could not find box two. I also hit the Beaver Creek box which was a nice walk. And also climbed through Washington Park to find the Japanese Garden Box. Little treey up there and I stumbled across what looked like a homeless person's bed pretty much near the box spot...so be aware if you head up there.</p>
<p>So if anyone has seen the Oxbow Two box let me know! Looking forward to the gathering.</p>

We couldn't find Oxbow #2 either.  I clarified a direction with the author,<br/>
but haven't been back to see if that fixes it.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like Forest Park as busy over the weekend!  Amanda stumbled upon one<br/>
of my contributions to the August gathering.<br/>
<br/>
To those who contributed stamps to the Sunset Magazine<br/>
article-that-won't-be, I will be returning them at the event.  If you can't<br/>
make it, I will mail your stamps back to you.<br/>
<br/>
See you all there!<br/>
