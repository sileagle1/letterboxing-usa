                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm looking for a boxer who is within a reasonable distance to Orange<br/>
City, FL, preferably one who has already found my mini manatee box at<br/>
Blue Spring State Park. It is a microbox and I recently had someone<br/>
e-mail through LBNA that they thought it was missing. I'm up here in<br/>
Maine and won't be getting down there anytime soon (sigh!) and was<br/>
hoping someone local would be willing to check up on it for me. Any<br/>
volunteers?<br/>
I'm not a member of the regional list, so if someone could forward<br/>
this along I would be grateful. Thanks!<br/>
