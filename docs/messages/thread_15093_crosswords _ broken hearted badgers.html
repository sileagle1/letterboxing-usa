First you say you love me for my misquoting Gorey - *Blush* I had <br/>
done an admirable job of getting my daughter registered for school <br/>
and then was finishing a PowerPoint presentation I needed for today's <br/>
class, so I was tired - now you tell me of this boyfriend, who <br/>
obviously does not appreciate you nearly enough. So what if you are <br/>
insane? Joan of Arc heard voices, too! I know I am insane about you. <br/>
*Sigh* <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, why use pen, at all? I do them blindfolded or just <br/>
mentally. If one has to use a pen, I find a good cane or goose quill <br/>
flat nib is just fine. And yes, I really can do uncial, black letter, <br/>
and a few other scripts. <br/>
<br/>
Hoping that this lover's spat of ours is not the thing causing the <br/>
bickering about the 'base on the board. Surely we shall never be so <br/>
base as to be bored with each other!<br/>

Do not fear, for I share your affection, if it be only in the rubberstamp world. As for the chosen nib of crossword completion, I find that the tailfeather of a pure white dove is often best, though that of a swallow is also a delicate tool. To quibble over such things will only debase and debauch the fine art of de-boxing, though...<br/>
