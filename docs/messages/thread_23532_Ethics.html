I'm still new to letterboxing and e-mail etc. Since I have been yahooing and reading all the hoopla. I'm very disappointed. There is a lot of petty knit picking going on. When I started letterboxing it was for the fun of finding a box and realizing how beautiful this country is. I have gone place here in RI I never thought of going. Last year on vacation my husband and I letterboxed in VA.  I'm a city girl. Bugs and I  don't mix. I have stuck my hands in tree holes moved stones to name a few. I've stepped in mud and horse poop. My family cannot believe it. The only thing I have regretted was getting all this harsh e-mail. Some of you need to lighten up. Don't be so mean to people. I realize there are rules to this LBing. Some of you know every last one. You may have even made up some of them.  Some of you remind me of my staff. You've been doing the job for a long time. The a new person get hired. That when the horns come out. I have to remind my staff. You were new once and you had to learn. Let give the new guys a chance. While I still have everyone's attention. I enjoy all stamps. I do get very excite when I find one that is hand made. I am amazed at the workmanship. Lets not make non carvers  feel inferior because not everyone is that creative.  I know some clue do say the stamp is hand carved. I really felt band that some people would  not bother to look for the  because in store bought.  Has letterboxing become a professional sport.  <br/>
<br/>
Sick of the mud sling.<br/>

<br/>
At last someone who can see past a mistake. Life is to short to knit pick. That is a great Idea I will see what I can come up with. I have just finished my first stamp. If this rain ever stops I will be planting my first box. As you know from my last mail. I'm a city girl. In order to plant my box I need sunny weather, dry grass, and no mud. Thanks for the tip<br/>

I love your state.  I was on a drama troupe for 3 years, based in <br/>
Cincinnati, and I went on 3 trips each year to Rhode Island and the <br/>
Providence Plantations.<br/>
<br/>
If I ever get out that way again, which I hope will be soon, I will <br/>
look you up!<br/>
<br/>
If you are ever in the Portland, Oregon area, let me know. We'll go <br/>
boxing together!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we could exchange through the mail our personal stamps and the <br/>
stamp of our first boxes. . .<br/>
<br/>
I'm going on a letterboxing campout tonight through Sunday and I just <br/>
can't wait!  I know some of the people who will be there but I'll be <br/>
meeting some new friends, too.  I have a feeling it's going to be a <br/>
fabulous time.<br/>
<br/>
Hope your weekend is great.<br/>

Let me know how your first box goes.<br/>

Anyway it is nit pick. The nit refers to the tiny head<br/>
lice eggs. If anyone has had a child with lice you<br/>
know the origin of the phrase because nit picking is<br/>
the most tedious job in the world. Picking the nits<br/>
out by hand is the only sure fire cure for lice and<br/>
you must get everyone of them<br/>

  I'm just gearing to finally place my first box, too! Congratulations!<br/>
<br/>
  I love your state. I was on a drama troupe for 3 years, based in <br/>
  Cincinnati, and I went on 3 trips each year to Rhode Island and the <br/>
  Providence Plantations.<br/>
<br/>
  If I ever get out that way again, which I hope will be soon, I will <br/>
  look you up!<br/>
<br/>
  If you are ever in the Portland, Oregon area, let me know. We'll go <br/>
  boxing together!<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe we could exchange through the mail our personal stamps and the <br/>
  stamp of our first boxes. . .<br/>
<br/>
  I'm going on a letterboxing campout tonight through Sunday and I just <br/>
  can't wait! I know some of the people who will be there but I'll be <br/>
  meeting some new friends, too. I have a feeling it's going to be a <br/>
  fabulous time.<br/>
<br/>
  Hope your weekend is great.<br/>
<br/>
  Let me know how your first box goes.<br/>

  &gt; Greetings from Rhode Island<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; At last someone who can see past a mistake. Life is to short to <br/>
  knit pick. That is a great Idea I will see what I can come up with. I <br/>
  have just finished my first stamp. If this rain ever stops I will be <br/>
  planting my first box. As you know from my last mail. I'm a city <br/>
  girl. In order to plant my box I need sunny weather, dry grass, and <br/>
  no mud. Thanks for the tip<br/>

  &gt; Actually, Rumford Pot, I think that's a great idea for a <br/>
  &gt; letterbox, "Knit Picking".<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; The stamp could involve knitting needles doing, I don't know, <br/>
  some sort <br/>
  &gt; of picking. Maybe picking a guitar! Not that *I* could carve <br/>
  &gt; that . . .<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; See, your typo can be serendipitous. I live in Portland, Oregon, <br/>
  so if <br/>
  &gt; you do this box, I won't see it.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; But, I'd love to hear about it, if you do!<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; See, there's never major mistakes, just our brains being creative!<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
