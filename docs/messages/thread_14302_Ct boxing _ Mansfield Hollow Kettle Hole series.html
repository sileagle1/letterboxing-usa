                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday was a glorius day- the weather was outstanding.  We went to <br/>
do the series of 17-- nice easy finds, mostly, but we couldn't find <br/>
3.  We really are quite sure that #12 and #13 are gone- found where <br/>
they probably had been.  Also #16 was nowhere to be seen-- we're not <br/>
positive that this one was missing, although, we looked very <br/>
thoroughly- after finding the exact described area.???????? Any <br/>
ideas?? We also did the Friends of the Hollow -- we were ready to <br/>
give up and looked behind one last pine tree- voila!!! We decided our <br/>
paces were longer than the person who wrote the clues! All in all a <br/>
great day- 15 boxes total. Today we spent our time on our other <br/>
passion- sporting clays shooting-- what a wonderful weekend.--S+S.Y. <br/>
