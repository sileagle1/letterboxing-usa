<br/>
Arriving at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, I turned in the brand new not so shiny silver Lincoln Towncar and boarded US Airways to Indianapolis. Picking out a nice sensible Ford Taurus, I drove across town and checked into the local Motel 6. Unfortunately, being so close to the New Year, it was the only place available. I only have one word to say on the matter. Dive.<br/>
<br/>
New Years Eve I partied in true style at the Blu Martini. The highlights of the evening were the psychic, sushi and the martinis, not necessarily in that order. <br/>
<br/>
Two days later I headed on over to Bloomington, home of the Elizabeth Sage Historic Costume Collection. Poison Ivy was there, slinking around in (what he called) disguise. Wearing K-Mart specials, I almost did not recognize him.  Der Mad Stamper had sent him on a mission to obtain, by hook or crook, the tip-toez gold glitter and vinyl sandals. Poison Ivy was more interested in the silk Garden Coat. Said his dear sister would look divine in it. Neither was for sale and the last I saw he was being dragged, sobbing, out the door by the security guards. <br/>
<br/>
Shaking the image of Poison Ivy and his poor taste of clothing out of my mind, I made tracks for the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Snowshoeing through six miles of trail was an invigorating experience. The Dunes include forests, marsh, river, bog, and shifting sands, making for interesting terrain. <br/>
<br/>
The Hoosier Uplands is a land of rolling hills; it is also the home of wineries. It is also time for the Third Annual Winter With the Wineries.  Visiting all eight wineries on the list, taking full advantage of their free samples, and collecting my free gifts made for a jolly good time. But, I did not come here to talk about sushi, sandals, dunes or wine; I came to talk letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Pathetic, Indiana, pathetic. Over 600 letterboxes in the state and only 25 are mysteries. That is not even worth talking percentages. On the brighter side, there are some very conscientious boxers in this state. The boxes are well-maintained and well-hidden, with good containers. Keep up the good work. Add more mysteries and you will be in excellent shape. Hiking Indiana in the summer requires some good insect repellent; the mosquitoes are fierce.  In the winter months, stay away from the shelf ice; it is extremely dangerous. When walking the shores always stay on solid ground. Any time of year wear appropriate footwear. Boots are good for hiking around quarries and rough trails. Keep your ankles safe. <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
<br/>
