<br/>
Newbie here with a question. I have never planted a<br/>
box before but there is a park within 2 miles of my<br/>
home where I am considering planting boxes. What I am<br/>
thinking about doing is "building a scene" using<br/>
multiple stamps. Basically, you would have to find all<br/>
the stamps (3 or 4) in the series in order to finish a<br/>
picture. Of course the instructions would be given as<br/>
to how to build the picture correctly and the stamps<br/>
would be small. Is this ok? Comments? BTW, it would be<br/>
very easy for me to check on the boxes.<br/>

still one of my favorites!<br/>

which creates your own Mondrian print), and there's another series of 7 stamps  <br/>
that build a picture of the Leather Caveman that I've found.  Problem is,  when <br/>
one goes missing, it pretty much ruins the whole series unless you can go  <br/>
back again to redo it (which I've done with the Mondrian series).  <br/>
