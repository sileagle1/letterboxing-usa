                    <div class="plaintext-content">My Fellow Letterboxers, <br/>
<br/>
It was a sad day when I turned in the LeMans Blue Metallic Corvette Convertible. She had served me well these past six months and I was going to miss her. It was time, however, to head to the airport and catch my flight to Boise City, Idaho. <br/>
<br/>
Landing in Boise, to a light rain and fog, I rented a Jeep Cherokee and set out for Craters of the Moon. "The Devil's Vomit," as it was once called, is a lava field along the Great Rift. Lava tubes, basaltic cinder cones, colorful flows, and kipukas are some of the features that can be seen. In December the Craters are a study in black and white. Cross-country skiing on the winter trail should be on everyone's to do list. <br/>
<br/>
A Boise newspaper ran an article, way back in 1973, accusing a politician of some shady doings relating to law enforcement up in northern Idaho. The print wasn't even dry when the bordellos in Wallace closed down. The dames jumped ship, not even taking the time to pack their belongings or wash the dishes. Now one of these fine establishments is The Oasis Bordello Museum. If you are in the area, stop by and take a tour. I'm sure you will find it entertaining. I did. <br/>
<br/>
Idaho's first territorial prison was completed in 1871. Over the next 103 years men, women and children were incarcerated here. Now on the National Register of Historic Places, you can tour the penitentiary and see how the inmates lived. There are many exhibits along the tour, including Don &amp; Gwen's favorite, "Groover Capers, The Dirty Side of the Criminal." They were once victims, I believe way back in '03, of a horrendous golden groover crime. The perp was never caught and they have long mourned their loss. <br/>
<br/>
Sun Valley is known for its Christmas skiing. There are other activities in the area, dog sledding for one. Sun Valley Sled Dog Adventures have an overnight trip to a remote cabin. I signed up, made myself comfortable in the basket, and let the musher and handler lead the way. We arrived at the destination safely, feasted on an excellent meal, and were entertained with tales of sledding lore. Dude, you should have been there. But, I did not come here to talk about kipukas, bordellos, prisons or mushers; I came to talk letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Idaho, do you know what a mystery is? Disgraceful, with almost 400 letterboxes in the state you can only come up with 14 listed mysteries? Are you trying to compete with Virginia in the driveby category? I am happy to say that you don't seem to know what a store bought stamp is either, and that is a plus. Nice sturdy containers out there; keep planting them! Fire in Idaho, as with any dry region, is a danger to be aware of. Make sure that all sources of fire are extinguished. Damage in fire regions can be increased by rain. If hiking these areas be aware that flash floods and mudslides can occur. Hobo spiders, cougars and bears are on the increase in Idaho; learn how to avoid them.<br/>

Sincerely, <br/>
<br/>

well now investigator,<br/>
you should have called me when you came to town, we could have looked up some of the local wildlife.<br/>
squirrels i mean. hehe...<br/>
one thing you missed about the "craters of the moon", is that it was used for training during the space race to train future astronauts. the landscape is suppose to be almost identical to the moonscape. the one bad thing about that place is, there is not much vegitation for hiding things. but there are plenty of "spor's".<br/>

If I remember correctly, your last squirrel episode resulted in this Investigator bailing you out of jail in the proud town of Olney. If I remember correctly, you still owe me.<br/>
