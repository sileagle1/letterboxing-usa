Royal Roads University campus "encompasses 565 acres of breathtaking <br/>
beauty just outside the city of Victoria on Vancouver Island. We are <br/>
located on the shores of Juan de Fuca Strait overlooking the Olympic <br/>
Mountains in a park that has been designated a National Historic Site <br/>
by the federal government. Our grounds include three renowned formal <br/>
gardens (the Italian, the Japanese and the Rose garden) and an old <br/>
growth forest. Our campus is criss-crossed by walking, cycling and <br/>
hiking trails and is home to peacocks, deer and other wildlife.  Our <br/>
grounds and gardens are open daily for the public to enjoy." (from the <br/>
website, www.royalroads.ca<br/>
<br/>
The letterbox is in the Japanese garden. If you go looking for it, do <br/>
check out the Italian garden and Hatley castle while you are there!<br/>
