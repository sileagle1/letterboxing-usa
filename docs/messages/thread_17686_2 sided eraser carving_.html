I also didn't have room on an eraser to carve a decent constellation AND put the name <br/>

Is this a very bad idea?  Obviously since I screwed up the reversal I need to recarve <br/>

Two of our boxes have two sided stamps (blueberry confusion and <br/>
wetland wonders) and no one has complained!  I think no matter what <br/>
you do, besides wearing gloves, you end up getting ink somewhere you <br/>
don't really want it to be!  Plus it adds a little personal touch to <br/>
each stamp image that a person takes since not everyone is going to <br/>
stamp the two or three or more stamps the same way in their log <br/>
book!!  <br/>

I can vouch for Blueberry Confusion... it's a fun stamp and <br/>
Camera Obscura and I had fun making different combinations of <br/>
the two sides in our logbooks. Didn't make it far enough to get <br/>
Wetland Wonders but now I want to go.<br/>
<br/>
Inky fingers are part of the fun! That's how you can tell who you <br/>
meet on the trail is a letterboxer. Besides... even with a one <br/>
sided stamp I get ink all over myself. I'm the messiest stamper!<br/>
