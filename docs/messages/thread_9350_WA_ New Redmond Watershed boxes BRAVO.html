                    <div class="plaintext-content">Bravo to Mischief for bringing us 4 great new boxes that certainly <br/>
rate a "10" on the Olde Tortuga Scale for Stamp Quality.<br/>
<br/>
I met Lizard and Catbird.  Boy are those two early birds.  They asked <br/>
me if I missed the first box and I had.  They had it with them .  <br/>
Apparently a group of Horsepeople came upon them as they were <br/>
stamping or finding.  Not wanting to give away anything they <br/>
discreetly tucked the box in pocket, to be replaced later. They <br/>
backtracked out so that they would encounter anyone coming in.<br/>
<br/>
Had some great birding with 4 woodpecker species in one spot ( Hairy, <br/>
Piliated, RB Sapsucker and N Flicker)How have we been so lucky on the <br/>
weather here??<br/>
<br/>
Anyway her boxes inspired me to be a bit more creative.  I hope I can <br/>
rise to even half her talent.<br/>
<br/>
I was dismayed to find I did not have my stamp with me.  I concluded <br/>
after a time that I had left it down at the Zugwa box in  Thurston <br/>
County.<br/>
<br/>
Then after a time of relaxation and woodland pondering my brain <br/>
reminded me that I had worked on the stamp, cleaning up some edges <br/>
last night.  Sure enough I had left it on the table.<br/>
<br/>
But no matter.  These new stamps are a great addition to the two <br/>
already in the park.  At 5 miles this hike goes fast.<br/>
<br/>
Hope those of you visiting from afar will make a special effort to <br/>
visit.<br/>

bear sighting signs posted all around, a little scary when you're <br/>
only armed with a 4 year old, a 1 year old and some cheese &amp; peanut <br/>
butter crackers!  ;)  I'm glad I have a reason to go back there, <br/>
now, what a neat little area!!!<br/>
