I have your Letchworth stamp in my logbook - it's one<br/>
of my favorites due to the story behind our adventure<br/>
finding it.  Not to mention the fact that it's a<br/>
beautiful stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the warning ... hopefully this person<br/>
will get a fit of the guilties and put it back<br/>

I'm not a lawyer but, I don't think there's anything the law could do.<br/>

Jelybean has since moved to the other end of the country.  I've<br/>
adopted most of her boxes locally, however Letchworth is a long trip<br/>
even for me.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have talked a little more with "the co-worker," who sounds genuine <br/>
and truly apologetic on behalf of his less-scrupled colleague.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know the identity of the person who took the box.  I've <br/>
asked his co-worker if he would put me in touch with this person so <br/>
I might try to pursuade him to replace the box or at least return it <br/>
to me.<br/>
<br/>
What concerns me most, though, is that this person knows of the LbNA <br/>
site.  Here's an excerpt from one of the co-worker's emails: <br/>
<br/>
"He (my Co-worker) just has a habit of finding, retrieving or <br/>
digging things up, kinda' like a packrat if you know what I mean.  <br/>
In recent talks with him at work, he has shown an interest in <br/>
the "letterboxing" web  site and said that he would check it out.  I <br/>
hope that by reading and viewing all the information that's on the <br/>
site that he will return the box to where he found it."<br/>
<br/>
What I'm worried about is that he'll use the site to find and steal <br/>
more boxes.  This is why I decided to post a note here, to let other <br/>
folks in Western NY know this person's out there.  If there starts <br/>
to be a pattern of boxes disappearing in this area, we might now <br/>
know who's behind it.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] NY: Warning Upstate Boxers<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you are a letterboxer in Western NY, I just wanted to let you <br/>
know about something that happened to one of my boxes this week.<br/>
<br/>
I got an email through the LbNA "contact the placer" link on Sep 1 <br/>
from a person who told me one of their co-workers accidentally <br/>
discovered my Letchworth box and simply decided to keep it.  He was <br/>
obviously showing it around work, proud he had taken it, and all of <br/>
his co-workers urged him to return it, but the person flatly <br/>
refused.  One of the co-workers wrote to me to let me know it was <br/>
gone.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to reply to see if I could at least get the box returned to <br/>
me, but there has been no response.<br/>
<br/>
So, there is a person in the area (Groveland NY?) who now knows <br/>
about letterboxing, knows how to get to the web site and search for <br/>
boxes, and has no scruples about simply stealing them.  I just <br/>
wanted you to be aware.<br/>

I have talked a little more with "the co-worker," who sounds genuine <br/>
and truly apologetic on behalf of his less-scrupled colleague.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know the identity of the person who took the box.  I've <br/>
asked his co-worker if he would put me in touch with this person so <br/>
I might try to pursuade him to replace the box or at least return it <br/>
to me.<br/>

Sounds like this individual has an untreated mental condition:<br/>
<br/>
"Scavengers, pack rats, and junkaholics are lay terms, but the <br/>
clinical appellation for their disorder is obsessive-compulsive <br/>
hoarding--defined as "the acquisition of and failure to discard <br/>
possessions which appear to be useless or of limited value," a <br/>
relatively new frontier in psychotherapy circles. <br/>
<br/>
Although hoarding behavior may manifest in people suffering from <br/>
psychosis, brain damage, or dementia, most severe hoarding appears <br/>
to be a subtype of OCD and is usually coupled with other OCD <br/>
behavior such as compulsive counting, hand washing, checking (making <br/>
sure the stove is off), and organizing (never mind!)" [paragraph <br/>
came from an online article from a professional organizer--one of my <br/>
other passions in life outside of letterboxing]<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, his office workers encourage him to seek help.  Living in <br/>
squalor is not a fun way to spend your life.  We can only hope this <br/>
letterbox sees the light of day again.<br/>

<br/>
I am originally from Western NY (near Canandigua) and have about 100 <br/>
ideas for boxes in the area (no exaggeration).  I live near Boston <br/>
now, so placing boxes in where I grew up won't happen quickly, <br/>
although I'm hoping to plant a few when I next return to visit my <br/>
dad over the Thanksgiving holiday.  In some ways, I kind of wish I <br/>
still lived in the western NY area, as far as 'boxing is concerned <br/>
anyway, 'cause I'd be a planting fool if I did!  There's not as many <br/>
spots that I'm connected to here in Boston and the number of boxes <br/>
already here is dramatically higher than those in and around the <br/>
Finger Lakes, Rochester, etc.  But anyway ...<br/>
<br/>
I posted here awhile back about seeking "caretakers" for any boxes I <br/>
place there given that I won't be able to check on them regularly.  <br/>
With the risk of someone stealing them, I'm less inclined to place <br/>
there now and even more determined that if I do I'll need a <br/>
dedicated caretaker for them.<br/>
<br/>
Those of you in western NY, please check on your boxes over the next <br/>
couple of months and keep us all in the loop as to the status of <br/>
this situation.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks!<br/>
<br/>
(And btw, to bring up the subject of caretaking again, the boxes I'm <br/>
thinking of placing in November will be in and around the Canandigua <br/>
and/or Rochester area -- if any 'boxers live in these areas and want <br/>
to help care for them, contact me offline.  I did get some offers <br/>
when I last posted, thanks to them for that!)<br/>
