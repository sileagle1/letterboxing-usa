                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you all for planting such great boxes in and around the <br/>
Portland area.  I had so much fun trying to find boxes.  <br/>
I was blessed to meet Sleepy Whippet, Bookworm and Funhog.  Thanks <br/>
for taking such good care of me ladies and linking up with me.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish I were there today for your gathering, and I hope it goes well <br/>
for you. =-)<br/>
<br/>
I'm back in Idaho and want to report on the following boxes that I <br/>
found while in Oregon:<br/>
<br/>
Canine Series/Playful Whippet in Gresham are alive and well. Cute <br/>
series.<br/>
<br/>
Circus Memories are doing fine in Gresham too.  So fun.<br/>
<br/>
Birthday Box is doing well and under cover.  I was wondering what in <br/>
the world is a huge green birthday cake-perfect!!<br/>
<br/>
Lewis &amp; Clark Microbox is looking good.  What a great idea for a mini <br/>
logbook.  =-)  <br/>
<br/>
Oregon Zoo boxes were fun.  Thank you Funhog for your patience with <br/>
me and not laughing too hard.  Bethany was laughing at me too as far <br/>
as the Wapiti as I've used that in clues before she so nicely pointed <br/>
out to me.  Oops!  I do have an awful memory.  =-)  I especially <br/>
loved Packy's Place-perfect spot and great stamp.  I need one of <br/>
those handy dictionary.coms too.  =-)  I've used it and the plastic <br/>
bag lots these past few days.  =-)<br/>
<br/>
Department of Reduncancy Department Box in Oregon City-what great <br/>
clues that were great and that tree is an amazingly amazing tree!!  <br/>
<br/>
End of the Oregon Trail box is well, but the stamp seems to be <br/>
falling apart.  I was so impressed with the mammoth wagon.  Awesome!<br/>
<br/>
Silver Falls State Park-I was running out of daylight since I got a <br/>
late start so I want to return for the rest.  What a neat park.  I <br/>
found francais falls =-), South Falls, Winter Falls and Buddah.  They <br/>
were doing well and what a great day to go with sun and few visitors <br/>
there.  <br/>
<br/>
Whoozy Goldfish II in West Salem is as whoozy as ever and waiting for <br/>
visitors.<br/>
<br/>
Spruce Goose is fine in McMinnville...I was a little spooked when I <br/>
walked by the GIANT shroom and it was set up for a homeless person, <br/>
but the stamp was so cute and the walkd fun.<br/>
<br/>
CT/OR Exchange is well and what fun.  I hope to return and enjoy more <br/>
of those great trails.  =-) <br/>
<br/>
Ace of Fun-thank God I figured out at least one. =-)  Thanks Funhog <br/>
for more Fun!! Spirit of Dartmoor is killing me...but I'll figure it <br/>
out one of these days.   <br/>
<br/>
Hidden Palms in the rain is doing well too.  We had to rehide <br/>
Multnommah Falls as it wasn't in its original spot.  Fun in the rain.<br/>
<br/>
Road Trip 2003-we searched, but couldn't find it so I'll email <br/>
Heather off line to see if she knows more on it.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you again to all for all your boxes.  I'm not sure when I'll be <br/>
back, but I look forward to it.  =-)<br/>
