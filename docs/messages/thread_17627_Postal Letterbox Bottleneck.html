                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all- Culex and I are back from our vacation/belated honeymoon<br/>
(we actually were only gone for 9 days although Phyto's idea of being<br/>
gone for a month sounded absolutely wonderful). When going through our<br/>
huge pile of mail we found a wonderful surprise. There were 4- that's<br/>
right F-O-U-R postal letterboxes awaiting our return!!! I have no idea<br/>
why they all showed up at once, but there they were. <br/>
Culex had to hold me back from ripping the packages open and going<br/>
into a stamping frenzy, though I did have to have a little peek before<br/>
unpacking and dealing with all the e-mails and bills and stuff that<br/>
had accumulated. Anyway, for those of you who are awaiting postal<br/>
letterboxes, I now have in my possession:<br/>
The Days of Her Life<br/>
Snowdaze<br/>
A Little Bit of Sunshine<br/>
La Poste en Bolivie<br/>
Sorry for those of you I kept waiting. I'll stamp up and hopefully get<br/>
them all on their way on Saturday when I can get to the post office.<br/>
