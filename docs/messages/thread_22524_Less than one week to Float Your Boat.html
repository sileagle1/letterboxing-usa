Well there is less than one week until the gathering in Liberty Lake. <br/>
So excited to meet you all. Remember that there are no reservations in <br/>
the Liberty Lkae campground, so the earlier you get there the better, <br/>
those that have sent a deposit I will be saving a site for. Just a <br/>
couple of things. There are about 14 planted out there right now and 2 <br/>
more on their way out there. This event will have a lot of kids there <br/>
so I would appricate it if we could keep it alcohol fee please. The <br/>
hike is beautiful and the weekend is going to be a lot of fun. Looking <br/>
forward to seeing you all next weekend.<br/>

Sorry just another little note. We will be doing a potluck <br/>
lunch/dinner on Saturday. Bring your own meat and drinks and we will <br/>
pass side dishes. Looking forward to seeing you all.<br/>
