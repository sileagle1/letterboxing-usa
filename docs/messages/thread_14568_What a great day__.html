<br/>
Sue &amp; I met TeamGreenDragon in Norwich, CT and did the following <br/>
letterboxes: The Patriot, Dragon Fire, Code 1, Indian &amp; the Fountain <br/>
Series, and Big Maple Sugar. We then headed to Charlestown, RI for <br/>
our first Rhody Boxes: Take It Easy, Frosty Drew, Truston Pond Quest, <br/>
Camping In Burlingame and Favorite Ornament Series. All boxes were in <br/>
good condition.<br/>
We only had enough time to get 5 of the ornaments but still had time <br/>
to reach our 200th find! After a great boxing day, TeamGreenDragon <br/>
and Sue &amp; I were invited for a cookout at Wanda &amp; Pete's! While at <br/>
the Miner's, we got their house box, The Throne and Garden Party. Was <br/>
this a great day or what? <br/>
When I got home, we found that the mailman had delivered a special, <br/>
wonderful hitchhiker carved by Delirium from Michigan, but more about <br/>
that tomorrow!<br/>

Wanda and Pete's neck of the woods tomorrow (errr...today, it's <br/>
Sunday already!), but the graduation party we were to attend got <br/>
