<br/>
Here is an update on the Who Let the Dogs Out series.  Letterbox # 2,<br/>
Rover is missing.  His hiding spot is down the hill with Rover nowhere<br/>
to be seen (darn, and that was such a cool spot, too!)  Since Rover has<br/>
run away, I plan to carve another dog and put him out on that loop<br/>
sometime in the near future.  A new dog will take his place somewhere on<br/>
the trail. <br/>
<br/>
Also, on clues for Letterbox #4, Spot there is no more tree rearing it's<br/>
Serpentine head.  Therefore, from the "tree with six trunks on your left<br/>
and a trunk of tree jutting slightly onto the trail, go approximately 41<br/>
steps".  <br/>
<br/>
The three other dogs on this trail are safe and sound and waiting for<br/>
YOU to stamp in!  Floating Feather and Sprout from New Jersey stamped<br/>
into the series in late March so that was exciting to see! Thom Cheney<br/>
and friends were there in February and Hannah &amp; Zeke with their way cool<br/>
stamps visited just a couple weeks ago!<br/>
<br/>
NOTE TO DER MAD STAMPER:  Can you please eliminate Who Let the Dogs Out<br/>
Letterbox #2: Rover from the clues.  I'll post new clues for dog #2 once<br/>
I get him/her carved and placed, and edit clues for Box 4: Spot by<br/>
removing the words: "From here go 8 steps ahead.  To the right is a tree<br/>
rearing its 'serpentine' head your way." and in the next sentence change<br/>
the number 33 to 41.  Or if you prefer, I can just re-do the clues on<br/>
WORD early next week at work and forward them to you.  Whatever is<br/>
easiest on you.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, your addition to the website for patches and such looks<br/>
fantastic!  Thanks for your hard work.  We are hoping to do some of your<br/>
boxes pretty soon.  I want to try to get to that Elk Rock Island box.<br/>
Not saying I can find it or anything, but I'll try to give it a shot!<br/>
We went by Washington Park yesterday, but it was a real zoo  (literally<br/>
and figuratively) with no parking, so that idea was bagged quickly.<br/>
I'll probably take the Max (public transit) to do that letterbox when<br/>
the time comes.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm getting behind on my finds!  With you, Thom, Ryan and Glenn planting<br/>
boxes and Gary &amp; Wayne lurking in the shadows with interest I need to<br/>
get busy and go hunting!  The Pacific NW has really turned into a<br/>
letterboxing hot spot recently!<br/>
<br/>
