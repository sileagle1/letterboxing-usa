I placed two boxes this morning at Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve in Darien, <br/>
DuPage County, IL this morning.  I signed in and filled out the form at the <br/>
letterboxing.org site, filled in all the blanks, and then clicked "Add new box" <br/>
at the bottom.  <br/>
<br/>
But it seems as if the boxes didn't get listed, and I don't know what I did <br/>
wrong.<br/>
<br/>
To check, I clicked on "member services", and clicked on "Your letterboxes" <br/>
and all that comes up in the waiver notice.  I clicked on that and the only <br/>
place I could see to click on the next page was "LbNA Home", which, obviously, <br/>
brought me back to the home page.  Where do I find the boxes I supposedly listed <br/>
this morning?  Nothing shows up on the northern IL page for them either.   <br/>
Since both of them are at Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve, I just listed them as <br/>
2 boxes but on 1 clue sheet. <br/>
<br/>
This is the first time I've listed any boxes on the LbNA site, and I'm not <br/>
exactly what one would call "computer literate" but the site seemed pretty <br/>
simple.  I've got 6 in all to eventually post on LbNA, hopefully by this weekend, <br/>
and I can't even seem to get the first one and two done.  Not a good sign.  :-)<br/>

Sorry tried to e-mail you off list but it did not<br/>
work. I'm no coputer literate either.  Do you perhaps<br/>
have a Mac as I do?  I could not post boxes from my<br/>
Mac.  I was in tears from trying over and over and<br/>
sending many heart wrenching  e-mails to the<br/>
web-master. Who now thinks this broad is as dumb as a<br/>
box of rocks.  Well anyway, that's my story. Thanks to<br/>
Hikers-n-Hounds for helping me figure it out.  A box<br/>
is not a box until someone has the clues.<br/>

I keep it typed in my browser history thing and just go in that way. I sign in and so far things have been ok. There was a contest a while back for people to submit a new look. Then that disappeared and I never saw anything else about it. I wrote to the address for the webmaster a couple of times and never got an answer. <br/>

&gt; Don't give up! Placing a box is part of the whole<br/>
experience. If new boxes are not placed we could be<br/>
like Jed down in LA and have to hunt our own boxes,<br/>

If you go to the page where you enter the clues and look at the date <br/>
field, it gives the form the date should be in (mm/dd/yyyy). That <br/>
means 09/02/2004. Enter your placement date that way and it ought to <br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
Also try the refresh button on your browser too. Sometimes they pull <br/>
up an old page stored in the history instead of a new one. Refresh <br/>
forces the computer to pull the current page off the web site. <br/>
Sometimes that's why you don't see changes.<br/>

Yes!  That makes sense.  I saw the way they wanted it, but it was <br/>
already in my brain as to how it shows up on the clue page, and I <br/>
didn't realize I wasn't doing it properly.  I go brain-dead around <br/>
computers.<br/>

I'm not trying to discourage from posting clues at letterboxing.org, just pointing out that that's not the only way to get your clues distributed :)<br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>

own website to post them &amp; then send a message here letting us know where to <br/>
find the clues.  Or, you could upload them into a folder in the files section of <br/>
this talk list at yahoo groups.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not trying to discourage from posting clues at letterboxing.org, just <br/>
pointing out that that's not the only way to get your clues distributed :)<br/>
Thanks for the suggestion, but I really don't want to attempt to set up my <br/>
own website.  If I can't follow the instructions at letterboxing.org properly, I <br/>
can't imagine what would happen if I tried to make my own website. :-)   Tho <br/>
I suppose I could do an AOL homepage.  I've been told that's pretty much a <br/>
Webpages For Dummies type of setup.  <br/>
<br/>
But Phyto's comment about how I entered the "date placed" was right on the <br/>
mark.  Once I entered the date properly, voila!, all was well with the world.  <br/>
And "Wes," who I guess runs the site?, got in touch with me right after Phyto <br/>
did, to point out the same mistake.  <br/>
<br/>
These two particular boxes should be extremely easy for beginner families <br/>
with children to figure out, tho the one around Signal Hill is a bit of a walk, <br/>
so it might not be suitable for too young of children.   The next two or three, <br/>
at Graue Mill and Fullersburg Woods, will be different.  I'm hoping to get <br/>
those placed this weekend, if I don't get called away to work.   On the other <br/>
hand, maybe what I'm thinking of as difficult will be quite easy.  For example, <br/>
at Graue Mill, folks will probably have to know the location of the stairs <br/>
that go nowhere.  When I found those stairs, I split a gut laughing.  In all the <br/>
various times I've visited there, I had never seen those three stairs, sitting <br/>
there looking rather ridiculous.  But maybe a ton of other folks have noticed <br/>
them.   <br/>
