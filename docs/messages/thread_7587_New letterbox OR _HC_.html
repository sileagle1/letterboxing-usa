                    <div class="plaintext-content">On September 7, 2002 Funhog placed the Beneath the Blue #3 Letterbox (HC) at Cape Meares State <br/>
Scenic Viewpoint near Tillamook, Tillamook County, Oregon. This park is home to one of Oregon's nine <br/>
lighthouses and boasts a stand of ancient Sitka Spruce in which some of the trees are so huge it will take <br/>
your breath away.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: from Downtown Tillamook at the intersection of Highway 101 and Route 6 go west 10 <br/>
miles on the Three Capes Scenic Loop. Go all the way into the parking lot by the lighthouse.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Take the trail past the restrooms to the arboreal cephalopod. Behind this landmark, the <br/>
Oregon Coast Trail continues on into the forest. Follow this path until you are standing between two <br/>
towering columns who came to this place in bygone centuries. Twenty two steps ahead you will find <br/>
yourself face to face with the Past, Present and Future. The Present  reaches for the stars while <br/>
embracing the Past at its feet. The Future rides on the back of the Past. The letterbox lives right before <br/>
your eyes nestled in the past, the future overhead. Move a loose piece of limb to reveal its home.<br/>
<br/>
note: HC indicates a hand carved stamp<br/>
