today in the automotive sections at sears i came across a digital compass a=<br/>
nd it had 325 degrees (as an example) under the NW (as example) on the sampl=<br/>
e..my guess is that the 325 degrees is for the rotation on a compass...it ha=<br/>
s suctions cups to adhere to your windsheild...<br/>
anyone else see one of these??....<br/>
<br/>
i wonder if i hold this in my hands instead that it would work like a compa=<br/>
ss but take all the guess work out of it since its all digital....<br/>
i know its nothing since GPS units have this type stuff in it but for lette=<br/>
rboxers it would be great since some of the hints tell you to go NE at 45 de=<br/>
grees....<br/>
just curious....<br/>
