talkative this summer!), so I'm sure the discussion has gone way <br/>
beyond what I've read, but like everyone, I've got a couple of <br/>
thoughts on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
We webmasters and many in the community have been thinking about <br/>
making the site database driven for years. Here's an example of the <br/>
sort of form we have in mind (some of you long-time letterboxers may <br/>
recognize the old-style fomatting):<br/>
<br/>
www.letterboxing.org/lbna/creator.htm<br/>
<br/>
We've admired Jeremy's phenomenal geocaching.com site for its <br/>
usability and seamless presentation for a long time. The whole <br/>
approach is doable...we just don't have the skill to make it happen! <br/>
I tried for a while, checking out a couple of books and studying ISP-<br/>
based database programing, but it fried my brain. I'm more a life <br/>
sciences guy...<br/>
<br/>
As far as a current status page for letterboxes, I fall on the "con" <br/>
side. I know from long experience how frustrating an unsuccessful <br/>
hunt can be, especially if everyone in the universe knew the box was <br/>
gone but me, but I think one of the charms of letterboxing is its <br/>
aura of mystery. (For the same reason, we took down the detailed <br/>
tracking notes on hitch hikers). I also know this is not necessarily <br/>
the view of the majority.<br/>
<br/>
We're certainly open to ideas on status-ing, volunteers to help who <br/>
know ISP, and to change!<br/>
<br/>
My most concrete suggestion today is to encourage folks to make their <br/>
own web pages and keep them updated as they see fit. It's really much <br/>
easier than you might think: I use a $10 program from Staples that <br/>
works just like a word processor. One of our founding principles is <br/>
that box authors are owners and retain copyright of their work. Write <br/>
them how you want them! Update your boxes' status and revisions as <br/>
you see fit. The pages stored on the LbNA site were originally few <br/>
and far between and intended only as "courtesy" pages. Candlelight's <br/>
offer to host other folk's clues on her site is one of the many <br/>
creative and refreshing new ideas I've seen: wonderful idea! We <br/>
webmasters are still quite willing and happy to update your <br/>
letterboxes in any way you wish: currently it's done manually but <br/>
that could certainly change.<br/>
<br/>
So, I'll keep working through the hundreds of posts this last week <br/>
and see what great ideas and artistic approaches you're coming up <br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
