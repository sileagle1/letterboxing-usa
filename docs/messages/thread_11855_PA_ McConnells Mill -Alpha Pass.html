Letterbox #3:		ALPHA PASS<br/>
Placed:		April 6, 2003<br/>
Difficulty:	Easy, good for kids and novices.  Remember,  I do this myself (or with kids) and dont climb trees or ford streams for fun!<br/>
Time Estimate:	Round Trip from Alpha Pass Trail Head to Eckert Bridge is about a mile and a half of relatively easy hiking.  Factor in the time to look for letterboxes and you figure it out.<br/>
Clues:     	<br/>
- Start at the Alpha pass trail head<br/>
- Go to the bottom the steps.  Follow the BLUE marked trail.<br/>
- Watch for a GIANT rock formation that looks like a natural bridge / underpass on your left.  You could walk underneath it from the path.<br/>
- From the mouth of the underpass, look 330* (degrees)  for a DoubleTree about 40 feet downhill.<br/>
- Standing on the roots on the EAST side of the DoubleTree, turn 45* (degrees) and walk under the fallen tree and around the large jutting rock.<br/>
- On the NE side of the large jutting rock, note the dead, but upright tree trunk on top of the rock.  <br/>
- The box is hidden near the roots on the SE side of this dead tree.<br/>
