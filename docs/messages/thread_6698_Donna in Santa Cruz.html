We also are new to this sport of letterboxing. <br/>
I had read in a past post that "Leafy" is missing. A number of the <br/>
S.F. Bay area boxes were planted a couple of years back, and it seems <br/>
that the owners are no longer interested in the welfare of the boxes. <br/>
<br/>
We have found that there aren't too many letterboxes in Northern CA.<br/>
BUT there are hundreds of Geocaching boxes. There is a lady who <br/>
planted a hybrid(called Ruth's hyrid here at letterboxing) up in the <br/>
Embarcadero area of S.F. A number of people have recently visited the <br/>
site(called Something Fishy on the geocaching site). Go to the <br/>
geocaching site. There you will not only be able to get information <br/>
on this hybrid, but you will also be able to read other peoples <br/>
comments on the hunt for Something Fishy(Cool and Fun!).<br/>
<br/>
We like both geocaching and letterboxing.<br/>
So we will be busy trying to plant boxes in CA and elsewhere. In the <br/>
future the majority of our boxes will be hybrids. <br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>
