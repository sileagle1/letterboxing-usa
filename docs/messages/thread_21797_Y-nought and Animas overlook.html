to make it to the park OK but the road leading to Animas Overlook was<br/>
closed.  The sign said they were doing construction to the campsites or<br/>
something like that.  The gate was locked and it was a 7 mile drive to<br/>
the parking area to Animas.  Needless to say there was no way we were<br/>
dragging the kids 7 miles uphill..LOL!  Please let me know if it is open<br/>
now.  We live in Houston Tx so checking on it from here is impossible.<br/>
My mom has a place at Durango Mountain Resort and we're considering<br/>
going up there this summer.  BTW..do you live in Durango?  If so, isn't<br/>
the pizza at the Olde School House THE BEST!!!  I wish I could pick that<br/>
place up and take it home with me!<br/>

Thank you. You are very kind. I'm going to try to make it up to Animas <br/>
Overlook this weekend. This was a big snow year for us and the road has <br/>
been closed for longer than usual.<br/>
<br/>
And I hope to have a few new boxes for you when you come back.<br/>
