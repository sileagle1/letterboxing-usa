<br/>
     My family and I were extremely lucky when we went after our first<br/>
box. We found it and the fever only got worse! (grin)  I know what<br/>
you mean about being bummed though because, after that, we hit some,<br/>
we missed some.  One thing we learned was to look at the box as a<br/>
bonus. First and foremost, we got something we hadn't had in a long<br/>
time and that was quality family time doing something that EVERYONE<br/>
enjoyed. We got to see places we'd never have known existed, we've<br/>
seen some breath taking sites and we've had a blast doing it.  If we<br/>
found the box, that was way kewl, if we didn't we still had a fun<br/>
family outing.<br/>
<br/>
     For us, the most fun comes from creating a box, in it's entirety and<br/>
planting it and then hearing back on it when someone else finds it. <br/>
I am sure that you'll find out that this hobby is both addictive and<br/>
wonderful, subliminal and breathtaking, where you can meet the finest<br/>
group of people you're likely to meet anywhere and have fun doing it.<br/>

Living is not about ending up in the grave at a sedate pace, with a well<br/>
preserved body, it is about sliding into the grave sideways shouting "Wow!<br/>
What a ride!!!"<br/>
