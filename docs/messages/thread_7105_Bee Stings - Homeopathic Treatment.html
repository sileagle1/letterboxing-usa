                    <html><body><p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>Recently, my hometown, Syracuse NY ABC-TV affiliate WIXT, aired a health segment on treating bee stings after a local doctor succumbed to one. I recently got stung and have had a mild, yet prolonged allergic reaction for two weeks. </p>
<p>I contacted WIXT who kindly sent me the transcript of the segment where a homeopathic product was mentioned that works for some people. I like that this product is not heat sensitive like epi-pens.  Below is that transcript.</p>
<p>"...A PHARMACIST TOLD HER ABOUT THIS, A HOMEOPATHIC REMEDY CALLED APIS, SHE WENT TO THE HEALTH FOOD STORE<br/>AND BOUGHT SOME.  UNLIKE THE EPI PENS WHICH ARE HEAT SENSITIVE, APIS CAN BE CARRIED IN THE CAR, AND AS YOU SAW, IT'S ALSO SMALL ENOUGH TO KEEP IN YOUR PURSE.  IT'S ALSO QUITE INEXPENSIVE...WE CHECKED WITH A HEALTH FOOD STORE AND THEY SELL IT FOR FOUR DOLLARS FOR 75 TABLETS.  BUT THEY SAY  IT DOESN'T WORK FOR<br/>EVERYONE, SO YOU NEED TO HAVE A BACKUP PLAN."</p>
<p>Hope this helps all of us. If anyone has used this either of these products after a bee sting, I would like to know what your experiences have been like. Thanks.</p>
