                    <div class="plaintext-content">I created a new design for a city microbox and perhaps a whole new <br/>
way to hide them.  I<br/>
<br/>
I take two film cannisters and tape the together bottom to bottom.  I <br/>
blacken the lids so they are not so easy to see.  In one end fits an <br/>
eraser size stamp.  I cut long 1 and 3/4 inch wide strips of paper <br/>
and staple them to a 1 and 3/4 inch length of pencil.  The pencil <br/>
piece makes the long thin paper strips easy to roll up in a scroll.  <br/>
The scoll log is rubber banded and goes in the other end of the film <br/>
cannisters.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't find a good place to hide them at one of my sites so I <br/>
decided to velcro strap the double cannister to the limb of a small <br/>
tree.  <br/>
<br/>
A kind volunteer is building me a website.  Perhaps she will reply <br/>
with whether the VA/DC/MD/? webmaster should post these or wait.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting and let me know what you think.<br/>

A city microbox <br/>
Handmade stamp<br/>
<br/>
Can you hum the National Geographic theme music from their specials? <br/>
Their headquarters is at 1145 17th St., NW, Washington, DC. Three <br/>
buildings span M street between 16th and 17th streets. One oldest, <br/>
one not so old and one new. <br/>
<br/>
1145 is a white marble building on 17th street. Walk in the doors and <br/>
walk right through the elevator lobby and go out the doors on the <br/>
other side. (If it is after hours you can walk around the building <br/>
down M street.) On the other side is a courtyard and the new pink <br/>
grey granite building beyond.<br/>
<br/>
Stand on the steps of the marble building facing the courtyard of pink<br/>
granite squares. Beyond should be the new pink grey granite building. <br/>
On your left should be the driveway leading to M street. In front of <br/>
you should be a rectangular pool with large pink granite boulders. On <br/>
your right should be a slanting pink granite wall with bushes behind <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Count off 11 pink granite squares as you walk along the slanting wall <br/>
on your right. At the 11th square stop and sit on the wall. There <br/>
should be a grating by your feet on the right. You should be facing <br/>
the end of the pool and the driveway and M Street beyond. <br/>
<br/>
Along the inside of the wall runs a grey conduit. Where you are there<br/>
should be a grey junction box. Under the box, lying on the dirt, <br/>
should be the micro letterbox made of two black film cannisters taped <br/>
together. Be sure to take it away from there to stamp in. There are <br/>
benches along the white building. Please be discrete as there can be <br/>
a lot of people around.<br/>
<br/>

Hand made stamp<br/>
Micro letterbox<br/>
<br/>
The Einstein Memorial, Constitution Avenue NW at 22nd St.  Step up on <br/>
to the black marble and look at Einstein.  The tourists all climb on <br/>
him and get their picture taken.  <br/>
<br/>
Brace yourself before you look down.  You are standing in the middle <br/>
of space.  Below you are the stars of our sky.  Just in front of you  <br/>
is the bronze disk of the sun.  Far to your left, you will find the <br/>
tree stars in a row of Orion's belt.  Very distinctive in the sky, no <br/>
three stars line up quite like that, it is somewhat hard to find on <br/>
this map.  (Pssst, there's a map in the free brochure.)  Rigel and <br/>
Betelgeuse (often pronounced beetlejuice) are its two brightest <br/>
stars.  I am told that in the original Arabic Betelgeuse <br/>
means "armpit of the hunter".  <br/>
<br/>
The hunter aims his bow at some dim hare but it looks more as if he is<br/>
hunting the V shaped face of Taurus the bull.  He will miss.  His <br/>
arrow will fly on and past the tight star cluster of the Pleides.  <br/>
You must follow it to reach your goal, on beyond the Sun and the <br/>
crescent Moon and up the sidewalk 14 cracks to a cedar on your left.  <br/>
Velcroed to a small branch at eye level is the micro letterbox made <br/>
of two film canisters taped together.<br/>
<br/>
Be discrete so that no tourist may see you and take or destroy it and <br/>
please replace it carefully obscured by greenery.<br/>
