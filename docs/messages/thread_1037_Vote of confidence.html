                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, Mohmers, for your vote of confidence in the choices made<br/>
here-to-date and the choices made in the coming weeks.    As one who was<br/>
there at the beginning I can assure you that the long-term best<br/>
interests of the group is a topic of daily coversation here.  <br/>
<br/>
	Did you know that if you planted a Copper Beech tree today that you<br/>
would never live long enough to see its mature growth?  But, you could<br/>
get it started with a good site, nutrients, a little pruning, and lots<br/>
of initial watering.  We are trying to take the long view while dealing<br/>
with some immediate problems.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks,<br/>
Susan Davis<br/>
