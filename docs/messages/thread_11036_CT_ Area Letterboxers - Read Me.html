                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to let all CT area letterboxers know that I recieved an <br/>
email from the director at Earthplace Nature Center in Westport, CT.  <br/>
(the 'Frosty The Snowman' boxes are hidden there)  I was unaware that <br/>
the land is privately owned.  However, the nature center is interested <br/>
in letterboxing and have asked me to adjust the location of a few of <br/>
the boxes.  I will make these changes in the next few weeks and posts <br/>
the change in clues ASAP.  Please take note ... if you wish to plant <br/>
any additional boxes at this park, you need permission from the <br/>
director.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx-  Letterboxer2002 (Alan)<br/>
