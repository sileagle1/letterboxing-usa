I know that the author of the the book "Honey Bee" is a letterboxer but <br/>
of course I have lost the connection (my brain) between her name and <br/>
her trail name.  Woo is Me.  Age and sun do creep up on you.<br/>
<br/>
Any way, KIM, if you are out there!  Great book, great job and thanks <br/>
for the fun read.  I've already passed it on to my 12 year old niece.  <br/>
Good luck with the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if by chance, she isn't on this disucssion board but any of you <br/>
other boxers know her, would you please let her know it was great.<br/>
<br/>
