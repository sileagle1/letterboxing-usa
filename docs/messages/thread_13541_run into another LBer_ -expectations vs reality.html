Wow! That would be a lot of fun to run into someone! Most of the<br/>
time you see the same stamps from the same people in all the<br/>
boxes you find or you find boxes hidden by the same people and<br/>
you start getting curious about who these people are. We're<br/>
keeping our eyes peeled from now on. We're not only searching<br/>
for letterboxes, but letterboxers too!!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun guys,<br/>

I second this notion. We almost never meet other<br/>
boxers, on the trail or otherwise, but I feel like I<br/>
know so many people just because we see the same<br/>
stamps all over. It's weird, eh? <br/>
<br/>
On a positive note, on those few occasions when we've<br/>
met others on the trail, it's always cool, and the<br/>
last time we did so, just a few days past, we've<br/>
quickly become friends in regular daily life too. :-)<br/>

close we came to running into other LBers! We recently were just <br/>
as amazed as you when we discovered the age bracket that <br/>
letterboxing falls into. We are the same age as you and thought <br/>
that it was mainly a "sport" in that age group, but we're glad to <br/>
see that there is a huge variety of people. Now my mom has no <br/>
excuse not to letterbox(hee hee)!! We hope that sometime we <br/>
will run into a letterboxer, we dont know what we will do, but I <br/>
think it would be cool. We bought a letterboxing patch and put it <br/>
on our official letterboxing backpack along with our other <br/>
patches, so be on the lookout people! <br/>

meet you!  You all stand there grinning like very happy idiots! (meant in <br/>
the best sense of the word!)  We LOVE doing exchanges now and search high <br/>
and low for boxers everywhere we go (even accosting that poor man peeing in <br/>
the woods....)  It just doesn't get any better than someone smiling at you <br/>
saying "you're BeMa -- how cool!  wow!  It's so great to meet you!  I read <br/>
all your posts!  etc. etc."  Of  course, being the outwardly self-conscious <br/>
hidden ego maniac that I am -- I guess I feed on that kind of attention - <br/>
but hey it is a really happy thing!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of exchanges -- we were lucky to run into Su, Joltin'Jess and <br/>
Jakizard on Bodie Island in the OBX.  They were the ones with the very <br/>
puzzled look on their faces, scanning the place where the box should have <br/>
been but wasn't 'cause we had it stamping in (always a dead give away!)...  <br/>
Be and Ma (who are very into giving out their signatures and stamps ever <br/>
since the Gather) were in seventh heaven and greatly admired the super cool <br/>
Joltion and Charizard stamps f rom Joltin'Jess and Jakizard.  As a matter of <br/>
a fact, they spent the next several days drawing different versions of these <br/>
Pokemon enjoying all different kinds of adventures (prompting the need for a <br/>
whole new pad of paper and folders to keep all the art in one place and not <br/>
gracing every surface of the rental house)!<br/>
<br/>
Not only were Su , Jess and Jake very friendly (even with a sunburn for poor <br/>
Jake) -- but they all appreciatively smelled my new logbook (still smelling <br/>
good 'cause I keep it tightly sealed in its own baggie to preserve that new <br/>
leather logbook aroma!...).  You've gotta love people like that!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
So, we at BeMa strongly encourage everyone to approach absolutely every <br/>
sane- and clean-looking stranger in the woods!  (ok -- in Ryan's current <br/>
case, cleanliness may be an option)  You never know -- it may be another <br/>
boxer and it is surely a wonderful thing when it is!   BeMa<br/>

I did gush didn't I?  You're just such a legend in LBLand!<br/>
Seriously that exchange totally made my vacation (family reunion - <br/>
camping at a peacock infested campground*)!  As soon as I got in the <br/>
car I grabbed the cellphone and called my two LB buddies back at <br/>
Massanutten (where we work).  "YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS!" <br/>
<br/>
What a coincidence!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the words of praise for the Joltion and Charizard <br/>
stamps.  It amazes me how easy stamp carving really is - of course <br/>
thank heavens for Google Image search!  We are thinking about a <br/>
Pokemon series even though they are somewhat passe now. Some of the <br/>
critters are very cool looking. <br/>
<br/>
You also deserve credit for making me take a second look at the <br/>
Flying OBX clues I had printed out - we had just been at that <br/>
location that very morning. Duh - Su! Got the East Coast Clone HH - <br/>
thank you! - and enjoyed the kite festival. <br/>
<br/>
Thursday we (the entire family reunion - 16 people!)went down to <br/>
Hatteras and got that one, then continued on to Ocracoke.  Found the <br/>
logbook swimming, completely destroyed. So we rescued it by starting <br/>
a new logbook and swaddling it with new zippies.<br/>
<br/>
During the course of the week I succeeded in infected one more <br/>
family with the LB bug - always very satisfying!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a great first exchange! Look forward to seeing you all <br/>
again!<br/>
