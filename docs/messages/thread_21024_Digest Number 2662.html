Sometimes it is really hard to Rate a Letterbox as far as how hard it will<br/>
be to find. For some like me, I can almost just walk along and know were<br/>
it's going to be at just because I have found so many and have hidden<br/>
so many.<br/>
<br/>
When I started Letterbox oh so many years ago, One box hider use<br/>
to have this canny problem of (Let's Say) 270' when it should have<br/>
been 90' just because they looked at the compass wrong :O) When<br/>
I was new I would have never found it but after you find a few and<br/>
think about checking  180' the other way when you can't find the<br/>
box just because, It really starts to click.<br/>
<br/>
I can get behind on the care of my boxes sometimes, Do I want<br/>
someone to go looking for a box that is not there anymore? No, Do<br/>
I get alot of E-Mail about boxes not being there only to go out and<br/>
find that they are? Yep.  Sometime's you have to take this stuff<br/>
with a little stride as I found that there are alot of people more than<br/>
willing to e-mail you the status of your boxes and that is wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
I have taken it another step. I placed my boxes on a Website and linked<br/>
them from NALB. You can log your finds and tell everyone your story<br/>
about finding the box. If you goto Letterboxing.org, Goto Ohio and<br/>
click on USMC in Clermont it will take you to this link:<br/>

<br/>
I's not like Geocaching where you are going to get a number for finding<br/>
it and I don't want Letterboxing to be like Geocaching in that way, but<br/>
I like the way you can tell your story or add a picture. It also helps<br/>
keep track of the stamp itself.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hiking<br/>
