Planted by Rubaduc (stamp by rtrw)<br/>

Easy drive-by<br/>
<br/>
When I was in the hospital last fall, I spent my days pushing the I.V.<br/>
pole up and down the hallways looking for good planting spots for<br/>
letterboxes, but my family talked me out of doing that so this box for<br/>
N.B.G.H. sits atop the hill overlooking building.<br/>
<br/>
Driving northerly on West Main St. turn left onto Park Place. Straight<br/>
ahead you'll see the Welcome to Walnut Hill Park sign. Turn left at that<br/>
stop and then immediately right at the next one. On your right you'll see<br/>
the band shell and then a left driveway marked by a wooden flower bed. Go<br/>
left and drive to the top of the hill and park. Walk up the steps between<br/>
the double columns and you'll see roofed sitting areas on each side. Go<br/>
to the right one and once inside step to the left railing and site 40<br/>
degrees into the tree line. You may or may not see a log on the ground<br/>
but head there anyway and on the east side of the north end will be what<br/>
you are looking for.<br/>
If you go on May 10th you'll run into the annual Race for the Cure.<br/>
