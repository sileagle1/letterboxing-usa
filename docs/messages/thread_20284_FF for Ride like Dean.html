                    <div class="plaintext-content">I hadn't planned it that way but I was the First Finder for the "Ride <br/>
like Dean" letterbox in Allamuchy Mt. Park in NJ yesterday.  It's <br/>
near a monument dedicated to a Mountain Biker who died on 9/11/01.  I <br/>
guess that it was fitting that the first find should also be on <br/>
September 11th.  Actually, I stood right next to the letterbox on <br/>
August 28th reading the monument.  I didn't know that the box was <br/>
there since the placers didn't post the clues until the 29th.  I'm a <br/>
Nordic ski patroller and was helping with the first aid coverage for <br/>
the 24 Hours of Allamuchy endurance mountain bike race.  It's a race <br/>
that Dean used to participate in.  I was hiking up to the 1/2 way <br/>
point to set up an overnight aid station when I passed it.  I <br/>
couldn't drive there at that time since it was on the race course.<br/>
<br/>
Since, I knew the scout camp ranger and had a 4WD truck, I was able <br/>
to drive right to it yesterday.  I was on my way somewhere else and <br/>
did it as a drive-by.  However, others won't have that convenience.  <br/>
It's near the edge of the Scout Camp property and you'll either have <br/>
to get permission or approach it from the State Park side.  The <br/>
scouts usually don't mind woodland hikers passing through.<br/>
<br/>
Allamuchy Mt. is a beautiful undeveloped State park in NJ and I know <br/>
that there's at least 1 more letterbox in the southern section below <br/>
route 80.  There might also be a mystery box in or near the park (I'm <br/>
still researching it.) I'd recommend checking it out if you're in or <br/>
visiting NJ.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
