&gt; My question is, why would I plant a letterbox that caters to the <br/>
&gt; finder?  I plant boxes because I enjoy the subject, or the <br/>
location, or <br/>
&gt; something about it is important to me.  I don't care if you have to <br/>
go <br/>
&gt; out of your way to find the box, plan out a route, or any of that.  <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; used to provide driving directions but have in time decided that, <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; know what, you are searching for the box, so you should really have <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; search for the box, and if that means pulling out a map to find the <br/>
park <br/>
&gt; the box is in, then so be it.  Why should I hold your hand to <br/>
direct you <br/>
&gt; to the park, to plan how to get there, or anything like that?  <br/>
People <br/>
&gt; should learn to use their brains and get out there and figure these <br/>
&gt; things out on their own.<br/>

I thoroughly enjoy the planning part of a boxing trip - laying out maps and<br/>

research to make sure there isn't something in the clues I need to be<br/>
familiar with before I go.  One of the biggest reasons I do all that work is<br/>
to minimize the time I spend in the car.  It is wayyy frustrating to get<br/>
where I'm going and find that the map wasn't quite right and I don't have<br/>
any help from the planter.<br/>
<br/>
I remember one particular situation where I was looking for a park tucked<br/>
into a fairly urban area.  It was nowhere on the local map and the planter<br/>
was kind enough to get me to the right city, but beyond that - nothing.  I<br/>
managed to narrow down the location by stopping several times and asking for<br/>
directions, but even after an hour of driving around the area, I finally<br/>
gave up because I simply couldn't find the park - never got a shot at the<br/>
box!  I emailed the planter and asked him pretty please for a little help<br/>
with the location and he kindly emailed me the cross-streets and the next<br/>
time I visited his city I was able to find the box.<br/>
<br/>
My idea of a good day boxing is NOT driving around in my car - it's putting<br/>

  However, I disagree strongly that the necessary conclusion to draw from that is to use clues to lead people by the nose to parks.  Plotting out where the boxes are and organizing the clues by their position on the atlas is part of the game for me, and far more enjoyable than, for example, distinguishing one random rock in a boulder field from another (and with less potential harm to critters from checking the wrong hidey holes).  With proper prior preparation, it can be done weeks or months before you even leave the house.<br/>
  I think many letterboxers tend to be map people.   Even if people don't want to buy maps, though, the internet is a very powerful tool.<br/>
  Even aside from that, not every box is for everybody.  If you suspect you won't be able to locate a starting point for something and don't want to waste gas, there's nothing wrong with deciding to leave it on the table for another day.<br/>

 &gt; Well here is a topic that I'm sure will cause a debate<br/>
<br/>
Yep, here it comes :)  (The Pennsylvania Clinton/Obama debate<br/>
is really lame (so far, no substance), so why not?).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I would submit that not giving any driving directions is <br/>
 &gt; just being lazy.<br/>
<br/>
I would disagree.  I would counter that it is a philosophical<br/>
or artistic decision, not laziness.  I don't thing pejorative<br/>
language describes the effort I personally put into clues that<br/>
do not contain straightforward directions.  That said, if they,<br/>
or I, are being lazy, their clue, their prerogative.<br/>
<br/>
With that out of the way, I would counter with "directions<br/>
from where", as if "where" is a place the seeker is<br/>
axiomatically assumed to know how to get to without research<br/>
(otherwise it just foists the problem to finding "where", so<br/>
you are being lazy by not telling them how to get to "where"<br/>
from their house, and what if such information is not available<br/>
on the Internet, or there are multiple routes or they change),<br/>
but that practical/logical argument isn't all that interesting<br/>
either, despite it, IMHO, being total justification in simply<br/>
listing the name of the park if that is the style of clue<br/>
you are writing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my take is that it is axiomatic that the planter is<br/>
always right.  Those who disagree are free to ignore a<br/>
particular clue at any point from first finding it 'til<br/>
they open the tupperware.  It is always up to the seeker<br/>
to research the area because the area changes while the<br/>
text is static (at least with the simulated treasure hunting<br/>
attitude), even when driving directions are involved.  I<br/>
think we all live happily ever after with that attitude,<br/>
but we don't, I get alot of grief for it (which I happily<br/>
ignore :-)).<br/>
<br/>
The reason is simple.  A clue that some, or most, or in fact<br/>
even all don't like is still better than no clue.  Eventually<br/>
someone may like it.  And, if it is so different that no one<br/>
else likes it at the time, it may bring on someone new with<br/>
new attitudes.  Just like the first mystery box.  These<br/>
attitudes are good and healthy, the promote diversity and<br/>
variety.  I'd be bored stiff if every clue contained<br/>
straightforward driving directions, and everyone in the hobby<br/>
craved such clues.<br/>
<br/>
My personal philosophy is that I enjoy clues that describe<br/>
_locations_, not _directions_.  Its _all_ about the route<br/>
and route discovery, whether that be during a mental phase,<br/>
physical phase, or combination of the two.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, I ignore clues with straightforward driving<br/>
directions, in keeping with the attitudes elsewhere in this<br/>
note.  So, if they all had them, I'd be out of luck.<br/>
So it goes back to to each is own, and ignore that which<br/>
you do not like, but don't assert someone is being "lazy"<br/>
for not providing something you like.  What if I said people<br/>
who fail to provide clues that are more complex than those<br/>
with straightforward driving directions are being lazy for<br/>
not taking the time to come up with more complex clues?  I<br/>
don't hold that attitude, but I hope it makes the point.<br/>
<br/>
As always, in good fun, and done without mentioning<br/>
"semiotics". :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

************************<br/>
That's a fine thought - if it works out that way - but I'm sure I'm not the<br/>
only one who has started out thinking it would be straightforward, or that I<br/>
had figured it out in advance (and believe me, I do a mountain of advance<br/>
planning before I set out to a new city to hunt), and it was just a matter<br/>
of getting there, and then deciding after an hour or so of trying to nail<br/>
down the location that it wasn't worth it.   I tend to be pretty<br/>
philosophical about not finding a box if I actually get to look for it, but<br/>
it is awfully frustrating not to even be able to put myself into a position<br/>
to get out and go look.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, as I think about the instances when I've run into such a<br/>
difficulty, I've also later come to the conclusion that the planter is<br/>
sloppy in their clue-writing all the way around.  Norths called souths, pine<br/>
trees called oaks, lefts called rights.  And when I run into that sort of<br/>
thing, I forego their boxes anymore.  They can plant 'em all they like, but<br/>
I'm going to leave them to other boxers to find.  No hard feelings, but I<br/>
find no enjoyment in figuring out whether the clue is accurate or not.<br/>
<br/>
I think a good placer thinks a box through from start to finish - 1) what do<br/>
I hope to get from planting this box? 2) what do I hope to convey to the<br/>
finder? 3) how am I going to get the finder to the box? 4) how can I<br/>
accurately (not necessarily plainly) convey directions to the finder?  5)<br/>
what do I want the finder to get from finding my box (i.e. "that was fun!"<br/>
or "cool place" or "I wouldn't have thought of THAT") Once a placer<br/>
understands their purpose in creating the box, they can write better clues<br/>
AND the thought they put into it comes through to a good finder.  There<br/>
might be a purpose in not putting the starting location, but they're going<br/>
to find a way to get that information across to the finder without stating<br/>
it.  But if there isn't a reason to exclude such information, why not<br/>
include it for the sake of putting the finder there more readily so they can<br/>
enjoy the real work of finding your box?<br/>
<br/>
Gotta go with Randy - this is definitely a more interesting debate than<br/>
anything I've seen this political season!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmmm, I would disagree that not giving driving directions is lazy.  First of all, I am assuming we are talking about non-mystery boxes here as it is quite common for a mystery box to leave the starting point to reasearch.  But even with traditionally clued boxes, for me it largely depends on the location.  I frequently do not give directions to the park, especially if it is something that is easily available via a map or basic-level research on the Internet (i.e. state and county parks).  If there is more than one entrance or parking area, I generally will give some bit of information at the beginning of the clue that would identify a street name, a landmark or a trail name.  It is true that this may require a person to think on their feet and do a little deductive reasoning when they get to the park (i.e. stop at the signboard and look at the park map), but in my opinion, figuring out where one needs to go is part of the puzzle of locating a box.  On the other hand, if the place is more obscure or only known to locals, I may give driving directions, either comprehensive or in bits and pieces, so the person would be able to figure it out before they set out and not be forced to drive blindly around the city looking for a sign or person who knows.  But even then, it is not always a given, at least not rote directions.<br/>
<br/>
I think to what degree one provides driving directions is as subjective as whether or not to give step-by-step trail directions in a clue or intentionally leave it somewhat vague so the seeker has to think or try various options.  With the availability of mapping services on the Internet, it does not necessarily require one to purchase a map for every location they will go to, just to do a little homework.<br/>
<br/>
The only part of the clue I try to be very specific on is the hiding spot itself -- if you have done the research and the puzzling to figure out where to go and how to get to the box, knowing right where to look will be pretty straightforward.  This is not so much in regard for the seeker as it is in regard for the environment.  I have seen too many letterbox locations that were completely torn apart and trashed because the clues where quite non-descript as to the hiding spot and people just started turning over every rock and downed tree limb.<br/>
<br/>
I have done many boxes in other cities &amp; states that did not provide driving directions, or even a park name in some cases.  But most of them I was able to pinpoint the place (and print out maps) using Internet resources before I went, often down to the exact place I should park.  If I were an out-of-towner and a box was too vague in this regard, I would just look for a different box.  To be honest, I often do not even use the driving directions in a clue even when they are provided, rather prefer to map it out myself to obtain a comfort level of the area I am going to.<br/>

  Well here is a topic that I'm sure will cause a debate, kind of like <br/>
  when we discussed clever clues vs. bad clues. I agree that you don't <br/>
  have to hold a finder's hand, but I would submit that not giving any <br/>
  driving directions is just being lazy. What if directions can't be <br/>
  found on the Internet, or the park has more than one entrance. Then <br/>
  the finder spends more time driving around than enjoying the place <br/>
  that you wanted them to visit. I think it is a little unreasonable <br/>
  to expect every finder from out of town to buy a map of the area just <br/>
  for your box.<br/>

Like my letterboxing onion analogy - not all boxes are for all people. Pick those boxes that you like and ignore those that you don't but please don't call another letterboxer lazy when they don't include directions to the location. That might just be there personal clue technique.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, perhaps lazy was too strong a word, but it sure feels that way <br/>
after you have been driving around for over an hour looking for a <br/>
place that could have been found easily if the placer had just given <br/>
an address or cross streets nearby.  I realize that some placers <br/>
prefer to make the clues cryptic and it is up to the finder to figure <br/>
them out or choose to ignore, but it's not always easy to know when <br/>
this is the case.  With a mystery box, you expect to do some work, <br/>
but with a regular box where the place is named and no other part of <br/>
the clue is cryptic, you tend to think the place will be easy to <br/>
find, so you decide to try it, even though you can't find much <br/>
information on its location.  Just like clever clues vs. vague clues, <br/>
the difference is subtle, but dramatic.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I like both types of clues; those that give <br/>
directions and those that describe locations that I can figure out.  <br/>
I can understand why you prefer complex clues, but am surprised you <br/>
would automatically ignore clues that give straightforward driving <br/>
directions.  What if the clues were very complex, but driving <br/>
directions were also included?  Wouldn't it make more sense to just <br/>
ignore the driving directions and figure it out yourself?  In fact, <br/>
all clues could be considered complex if you just ignore the parts <br/>
you don't want to know.  Of course, this begs the question "How much <br/>
is too much?" before you will ignore a set of clues.  Taking your <br/>
analogy to the nth degree, I suspect the only box worthy of your <br/>
attention would be one that gives no specific information at all.  <br/>
So, in this spirit, I humbly submit a set of clues that I hope will <br/>
spark your interest :)<br/>
<br/>
LB Name:  ?<br/>
Placed By:  ?<br/>
State:  One of 50<br/>
County:  One of many<br/>
Nearest City:  One of several<br/>
Clues:  Find the park, walk down a trail and look behind a tree.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
Silver Eagle<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My personal philosophy is that I enjoy clues that describe<br/>
&gt; _locations_, not _directions_.  Its _all_ about the route<br/>
&gt; and route discovery, whether that be during a mental phase,<br/>
&gt; physical phase, or combination of the two.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Therefore, I ignore clues with straightforward driving<br/>
&gt; directions, in keeping with the attitudes elsewhere in this<br/>
&gt; note.  So, if they all had them, I'd be out of luck.<br/>
&gt; So it goes back to to each is own, and ignore that which<br/>
&gt; you do not like, but don't assert someone is being "lazy"<br/>
&gt; for not providing something you like.  What if I said people<br/>
&gt; who fail to provide clues that are more complex than those<br/>
&gt; with straightforward driving directions are being lazy for<br/>
&gt; not taking the time to come up with more complex clues?  I<br/>
&gt; don't hold that attitude, but I hope it makes the point.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As always, in good fun, and done without mentioning<br/>
&gt; "semiotics". :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You can't assume every planter uses a clue technique, and I think that's<br/>
where the rub lies  where is omitting directions clever and when is it<br/>
lazy?  What I hope this discussion points up for placers is the need for<br/>
forward-thinking, deliberate clue writing, as opposed to tossing clues down<br/>
on paper like they are nothing more than a grocery list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a box that I placed in a park that is literally 10' x 15'.  It is<br/>
located behind a very popular homegrown store, but virtually no one knows it<br/>
is there.  I'll bet if you asked 50 locals where it is, they would tell you<br/>
there is no such place in our town.  You might be able to ask another 50 and<br/>
find one person who has actually noticed it, and ask another 50 and find<br/>
someone who can tell you precisely where it is.  But I'm betting that of<br/>
those 150, a good 20 will try their best to help you but will probably wind<br/>
up sending you to one cemetery or another.  It isn't google-able.  It isn't<br/>
listed on any websites.  There's no reference to it on the city's website<br/>
(it's a private park) and the chamber of commerce has no idea it exists.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I never mentioned the park's name in the clue, but I make a veiled reference<br/>
to the nearby store and locals will have that much figured out before they<br/>
finish reading the clue and it's enough that out-of-towners can do a little<br/>
noodling to figure it out, and if they can't, I invite them to write me for<br/>
an extra out-of-towner's clue.  Most everybody who goes looking for it finds<br/>
it, if not the first time then usually on the second or third time.  And<br/>
they get that sense of satisfaction we all get when we work hard to<br/>
accomplish something and succeed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I had simply said "Go to ___________ Park", it would have sounded pretty<br/>
straightforward, and if it were me trying to find it, I would say to myself<br/>
"Well I've done a little research and that park isn't listed on any websites<br/>
and I can't google it and it isn't on any of the maps I've looked at, but<br/>
that's a small town and surely I can ask around and find the place".  And<br/>
that's what I would do, thinking it would be kind of cool anyway to hang out<br/>
and meet and talk to a few locals and get a feel for the real town.  They<br/>
would try to help me, but they would run me all over town and after a couple<br/>
hours (because once I spend a little time trying, it's hard to walk away) of<br/>
blind searching, I would give up, very frustrated.  Is that really artful<br/>
clue-writing, when the finder has to rely heavily on good fortune to<br/>
eventually stumble across either the park or the 1/150 person who knows<br/>
where it is?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, a good planter puts a lot of diligence into every word of a<br/>
clue, especially if their intent is to take a minimalist approach.  There<br/>
should be nothing haphazard, but it should be solvable with the words in the<br/>
clue itself AND some research AND a little brainwork thrown in.  But I<br/>
suppose there might be some planters who disagree, that boxes that rely on<br/>
luck to find even the starting point are good.   I'll leave that luck layer<br/>
of the onion on the cutting board  I'm not much of a gambler and probably<br/>
never will be.  I prefer the use of resources like maps and research tools<br/>
and my own brainpower (however limited it may be on a day-to-day basis!) in<br/>
letterboxing!<br/>

&gt; Well here is a topic that I'm sure will cause a debate, kind of like <br/>
&gt; when we discussed clever clues vs. bad clues.  I agree that you don't <br/>
&gt; have to hold a finder's hand, but I would submit that not giving any <br/>
&gt; driving directions is just being lazy.  What if directions can't be <br/>
&gt; found on the Internet, or the park has more than one entrance.  Then <br/>
&gt; the finder spends more time driving around than enjoying the place <br/>
&gt; that you wanted them to visit.  I think it is a little unreasonable <br/>
&gt; to expect every finder from out of town to buy a map of the area just <br/>
&gt; for your box.  If the place really is important enough for you to <br/>
&gt; place a box there, why not give a little help finding it, then make <br/>
&gt; the clues to the box tricky.  I would much prefer the challenge of <br/>
&gt; finding the box on foot rather then the park by car.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Silver Eagle<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My question is, why would I plant a letterbox that caters to the <br/>
&gt; &gt; finder?  I plant boxes because I enjoy the subject, or the <br/>
&gt; location, or <br/>
&gt; &gt; something about it is important to me.  I don't care if you have to <br/>
&gt; go <br/>
&gt; &gt; out of your way to find the box, plan out a route, or any of that.  <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt; used to provide driving directions but have in time decided that, <br/>
&gt; you <br/>
&gt; &gt; know what, you are searching for the box, so you should really have <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; search for the box, and if that means pulling out a map to find the <br/>
&gt; park <br/>
&gt; &gt; the box is in, then so be it.  Why should I hold your hand to <br/>
&gt; direct you <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I once read (probably in the National Enquirer) that the smarter a person<br/>
is, the easier it is for them to get lost.  The smarter folks supposedly<br/>
have little to no sense of direction and how they've travelled.<br/>
<br/>
If that's true, then I can beat Einstein's IQ by about 329 points, so I'm<br/>
figuring it can't be true........<br/>
<br/>
But what I DO use and it works by golly, are marbles.  At each<br/>
fork/intersection in the trail where Caveman &amp; I know we might have a<br/>
disagreement on the direction we came from -- he's not nearly as smart as I<br/>
am so he tends to not get lost so easily :-) -- we put a marble on the side<br/>
of the trail a foot or so down the trail.  Caveman thought maybe orange<br/>
spray paint on the side of trees would be a whole lot easier but I told him<br/>
that was the lazy man's way.  Marbles at least make him bend.  But he was<br/>
smarter than me there -- he just drops 'em on the side of the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, being as how we pick up the marbles on the return trip, it's<br/>
only a one-shot guidance system.  :-)  And that's why sometimes when I go<br/>
out to do maintenance, it takes me an hour with the maps to remember just<br/>
what I did the previous time out.<br/>
<br/>
As regards driving directions to the park/preserve/etc, however, I guess<br/>
I'll just say all my boxes are mystery boxes then and make it easier on<br/>
folks' blood pressure.  Because there are very few boxes where I give out<br/>
much of ANYthing in the way of driving directions.  Has absolutely nothing<br/>
to do with laziness.  That's how I like to play da game. My clues tend to be<br/>
very precise.  They're just not always easy to figure out.  And they're<br/>
sometimes a little scarce in spots.  But what's there does the trick just<br/>
the way I want it to.<br/>
<br/>
And since it's been nearly an hour since my mid-afternoon nap ended, it's<br/>
time for my early-evening nap.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone got out &amp; walked yesterday.  Yesterday was supposedly National<br/>
Begin Walking Day.  Did 6.0 miles in 60 minutes.  Am gettin' old.  But a<br/>
blessing about gettin' old is that, because I'm gettin' old, I keep<br/>
forgettin' I'm gettin' old.<br/>

We don't use driving directions, but awhile back we left a trail of<br/>
breadcrumbs from the starting point to the letterbox we planted.<br/>
Unfortunately we tried to check on it for maintenance a month after it<br/>
was planted but we couldn't find it. I tried to contact the placer for<br/>
some hints but we didn't respond.<br/>
<br/>
I'm considering using a long length of string, does anyone know if that<br/>
will work?<br/>

 &gt; I think that's where the rub lies  where is omitting directions<br/>
 &gt; clever and when is it lazy?<br/>
<br/>
We don't know.  We don't care.  Their clue, their life, their time,<br/>
their prerogative.  Who am I to judge whether they are clever or lazy?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps they intended to, but forgot.  Now I have to judge whether<br/>
they are clever, lazy, or forgetful?  No thanks.  A clue is a collection<br/>
of symbols that describe a location.  The writer is long gone, probably<br/>
busy eating Don's bread crumbs.  Its all role of the reader stuff.  As<br/>
the writer is long gone, it means nothing to the task at hand what he<br/>
was, including clever, lazy, forgetful, or a bread crumb glutton.<br/>

Gatlinburg that's close to some mountains she thinks are really cool thanks<br/>

in the way of lions and tigers and bears?  Not that Mosey doesn't have great<br/>

of 4 legged things that have bigger teeth and claws than me.  And of the few<br/>
bears I've had the misfortune to come close to, none of them yet has been<br/>
smaller than me.  I don't care how cute those idiotic Charmin t.p.<br/>

the city wilderness.<br/>

 As regards driving directions to the park/preserve/etc, however, I guess<br/>
 I'll just say all my boxes are mystery boxes then and make it easier on<br/>
 folks' blood pressure. Because there are very few boxes where I give out<br/>
 much of ANYthing in the way of driving directions. Has absolutely  <br/>
 nothing<br/>
 to do with laziness. That's how I like to play da game. My clues tend  <br/>
 to be<br/>
 very precise. They're just not always easy to figure out. And they're<br/>
 sometimes a little scarce in spots. But what's there does the trick just<br/>
 the way I want it to.<br/>

I used to be a city fellow, but traded that in 45 years ago for Smoky  <br/>
Mountain suburbia where gas is now only $3.31/gal.  Real estate is  <br/>
too high in Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg right now.  What you want is  <br/>
a house on Fort Loudoun Lake or on one of our many rivers, or  <br/>
somewhere around Asheville, NC (western North Carolina).  And say,  <br/>
you drive in a big city, but are concerned about a bear attack?   <br/>

Hi Michel,<br/>
<br/>
It's Caveman. Donned your asbestos suit, eh? But you fergot a<br/>
word.........it's LAZY slackerds, LAZY slackerds. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Got a bone to pick with youse. Mosey is now looking at rural real estate<br/>
close to a place called Pigeon Forge that's close to a place called<br/>
Gatlinburg that's close to some mountains she thinks are really cool  <br/>
thanks<br/>
to YOUR photos. Forgive the pun, but clue me in here. What are we  <br/>
talking<br/>
in the way of lions and tigers and bears? Not that Mosey doesn't have  <br/>
great<br/>
aim. But frankly I'm a City Caveman. I'd prefer not to live within range<br/>
of 4 legged things that have bigger teeth and claws than me. And of  <br/>
the few<br/>
bears I've had the misfortune to come close to, none of them yet has  <br/>
been<br/>
smaller than me. I don't care how cute those idiotic Charmin t.p.<br/>
commercials make them look, they can have the forest wilderness, I'll  <br/>
take<br/>
the city wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
Write a great BIG note to yourself to send no more beautiful scenic wild<br/>
mountain photos.<br/>

<br/>
They might be.  More likely on other fora, as this would have been a<br/>
certain flame war in days past.  I was personally surprised the P/F<br/>
ratio thread did not recycle.  The thread cycle seems to be about 6<br/>
months, and we recently went thru planters v finders again; I figured<br/>
we were to then recycle P/F ratio, but WDIK?<br/>
<br/>
For my part, I think finders who never plant (newbies excluded, of,<br/>
course), should offer up a gratuity to the planters for providing for<br/>
their entertainment.  If this doesn't get the messages flying and the<br/>
asbestos underwear donned, then we know the list is dead, and ready<br/>
to be decommissioned, which is a fine prospect in my book.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

&gt; Well here is a topic that I'm sure will cause a debate, kind of <br/>
like when we discussed clever clues vs. bad clues.  I agree that you <br/>
don't have to hold a finder's hand, but I would submit that not <br/>
giving any driving directions is just being lazy.  What if directions <br/>
can't be found on the Internet, or the park has more than one <br/>
entrance.  Then the finder spends more time driving around than <br/>
enjoying the place that you wanted them to visit.  I think it is a <br/>
little unreasonable to expect every finder from out of town to buy a <br/>
map of the area just for your box.  If the place really is important <br/>
enough for you to place a box there, why not give a little help <br/>
finding it, then make  the clues to the box tricky.  I would much <br/>
prefer the challenge of finding the box on foot rather then the park <br/>
by car.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Silver Eagle<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My question is, why would I plant a letterbox that caters to the <br/>
&gt; &gt; finder?  I plant boxes because I enjoy the subject, or the <br/>
&gt; location, or <br/>
&gt; &gt; something about it is important to me.  I don't care if you have <br/>
to go  out of your way to find the box, plan out a route, or any of <br/>
that.  <br/>
&gt; I  used to provide driving directions but have in time decided <br/>
that, you know what, you are searching for the box, so you should <br/>
really have to <br/>
&gt; &gt; search for the box, and if that means pulling out a map to find <br/>
the  park the box is in, then so be it.  Why should I hold your hand <br/>
to &gt; direct you  to the park, to plan how to get there, or anything <br/>
like that?  People should learn to use their brains and get out there <br/>
and figure these  things out on their own.<br/>
