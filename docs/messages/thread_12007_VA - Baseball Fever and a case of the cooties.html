The kids might not recognize "who's on first" as the classic routine, but, <br/>
they know the letterbox when they see it!  I can't believe this is our first <br/>
find during Spring Break (not counting the NC box).  How many days have we <br/>
wasted?  Oh well!<br/>
<br/>
We found the little baseball field after walking all around the park in the <br/>
other direction (It's been a long time since we found Reiku -- the first <br/>
ones!)<br/>
<br/>
Be loved the stamp because it fits so nicely with his personal stamp!<br/>
<br/>
We were also thrilled to find the Cooties HH!  The kids don't know what <br/>
cooties are either, but they are adorable (both the stamp images and my <br/>
little ones -- if I do say so myself...)<br/>
<br/>
What a great history for this HH.  It's been to CA, NC and now VA.  We are <br/>
going to do our best to replant it somewhere in MD or DC so it can add <br/>
another state to its travel log.  It was great to see that it had been in <br/>
the hands of the notorious Tar heel Amanda from Seattle and Randy (whose <br/>
Pokemon stamps we are going to plant very soon -- they've been by the <br/>
computer all winter watching and waiting).  Then, the last person to plant <br/>
the stamp was Mary, Daughter of the Old Dominion.  How odd it is to feel so <br/>
excited to connect to people that you have never met face to face!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of face to face, we're still game for a mini gather this week....  <br/>
How does Thursday or Friday at Riverbend look to anyone?<br/>
