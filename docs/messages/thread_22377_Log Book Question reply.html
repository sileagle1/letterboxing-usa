                    <div class="plaintext-content">I leave my log books in the letterboxes until they are<br/>
full or damaged. At that point I put in a new log book<br/>
and label it book #2, list the original box placement<br/>
date and the date the new log book was put in. Some of<br/>
my slower traffic boxes have log books that have been<br/>
out about 3 years. It would be a shame to lose the<br/>
entire book to damage but I think leaving the book out<br/>
 so finders can see who has been there, read the<br/>
notes, see the stamps and see the history of the box<br/>
is more important. I do check up on my boxes, replace<br/>
plastic bags, and make sure it is dry and doing well.<br/>
While I'm there I always read the log book. If it's<br/>
lost or destroyed someday I would have at least seen<br/>
some of the entries. You have to remember though that<br/>
the log book is of interest to all the people that<br/>
vist that box, not just the owner. I'll continue to<br/>
take the chance and leave the books out until they are<br/>
full.....Chuck and Molly <br/>

&gt; I am new to letterboxing and I was wondering how<br/>
&gt; long to you leave the <br/>
&gt; log book out? What I mean is, if you have a slow box<br/>
&gt; that doesn't get a <br/>
&gt; lot of traffic and after a year or so would you tear<br/>
&gt; out a the few <br/>
&gt; enteries you have or repalce the book or just leave<br/>
&gt; it out. To me it <br/>
&gt; would be a shame to have a log book out there with<br/>
&gt; some nice stamps and <br/>
&gt; comments only to have it lost for whatever reason.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was curiuos as to what other people felt.<br/>
