<div><strong>OMA'S OUTLOOK </strong>is the name of a letterbox 
placed on  September 8, 2001 on the <strong>MICA HILL LEDGES </strong>in 
<strong>Durham, Connecticut </strong>in <strong>Middlesex 
</strong><strong>County. </strong></div>
<div><strong>Difficulty : </strong>a single letterbox on a 
relatively easy hike. The exception is the short but steep climb to the top. It 
is approximately 1 hour's  duration (thirty minutes to the ledges and thirty 
back). However, once up at the ledges, you will want to stay and take in the 
view. </div>
<div><strong>Directions: </strong>From Durham Town Center, take RT 
17 south. Turn left onto RT 77. After approximately 1 mile turn left onto 
Diongi Rd.  (If you come to Mica Hill Rd., you have gone too far.)  At the 
end of Diongi, take a right and go to the end of the paved road. Park on the 
left side of the paved portion to allow other vehicles to pass.</div>
<div><strong>The Hike: </strong>From the parking lot, follow the 
<strong>Blue Trail </strong>to the <strong>right. Stay </strong>on the 
<strong>Blue Trail </strong>even when the path forks. ( stay to the left at the 
fork) Follow the <strong>Blue Trail </strong>to <strong>Pyramid Rock 
</strong>and on past up the step hill-that's the most difficult part. Now enjoy 
the hike along the ridge until you come to the ledges ( exposed rock face ). The 
smaller ledge is first and then comes <strong>Oma's Outlook, 
</strong>the</div>
<div>largest of the rock faces. Bring water and a snack as you will 
want to sit and feel the joy of just being there. If you bring children, tell 
them to be careful, a fall on the rock will hurt. When you are done, follow the 
Blue Trail back the way you came.</div>
<div><strong>The Letterbox </strong>is hidden on the north end of 
<strong>Oma's Outlook </strong>under a granite flake of rock. Look under the 
farther end of the flake,</div>
<div>away from the trail. It has a rock and some branches in front 
of it. Please be so kind as to return the letterbox when you are done and 
replace the rock and branches.</div>
