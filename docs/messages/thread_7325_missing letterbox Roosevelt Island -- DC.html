<div>We had a great walk on Roosevelt Island, but, 
unfortunately, after digging in the ivy, were unable to locate the 
letterbox.  Has anyone seen it recently?  All the indicators were in 
place so I'm pretty sure we had the right spot.  I sent an email to the 
family that placed it originally.  Is there anything else to do?  
Thanks!  Nancy</div></body></html>

<div>Hi Coleen!  We were looking for the one 
across from the jutting rocks on the trace of a path back a few steps by the 
ivy.</div>

<div>Is there another letterbox on Roosevelt

We didnt need a compass and actually found a different<br/>

good clues though and a nice hike.  And there's also 2<br/>

My family also could not find the letterbox you are referring <br/>
to...we were there on August 24th, and believed we were in the right <br/>
place, and looked all over in the ivy.  (And I got stung by a bee - <br/>
ouch!)<br/>
<br/>
There was one redeeming aspect of the trip (keeping in mind that I <br/>
normally still enjoy hikes where we don't find boxes, but the bee <br/>
sting put me over the edge that day!) We did find the second box on <br/>
the island.  It's called Teddy's Box, and I've included a link to <br/>
the clues:  http://www.letterboxing.org/wdc/squirrelwdc.htm#Teddy<br/>
<br/>
If you hear anything else about the first box, let me know.  I might <br/>
brave the bees to search again if I thought it were really there!  :)<br/>

letterbox, so it was a bit of a bummer, but, i am glad to find that someone <br/>
else couldn't find it and we weren't just incompetant...<br/>
<br/>
It was nice to see Roosevelt Island as I had never been there.  I just came <br/>
home with poison ivy (or that could have been Frying Pan Park...) but my <br/>
husband got stung by a bee too!!!  Attitude problem with the insect life <br/>
there!  Poor thing, he was trying to downplay it so much so the kids <br/>
wouldn't get upset, meanwhile his arm is swelling up...<br/>
<br/>
It was a great time to get the family together though and the trails were <br/>
very nice.<br/>
<br/>
The familz that planted the letterbox said that they were going to check it <br/>
when they visited DC.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the info on the second box.  i was not aware of it when we <br/>
went.  When I hear that the first one has been replaced (if it is) then we <br/>
will run back and look for them both!<br/>
<br/>
When you have a chance, head over to Meadow Lark Gardens in Vienna.  We have <br/>
just planted our first box there and are very excited to see if we did it <br/>
right!  Thanks again!<br/>
