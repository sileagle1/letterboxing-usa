                    <html><body>Mother Goose letterbox - this letter box is at Green Spring Gardens Park, in Fairfax County, Virginia, in the town of Annandale, and was hidden with small children in mind on October 17, 2002. This is a VERY easy walk on a brick path and suitable for strollers.<br/>
Go to the Horticulture Center and pick up a map of the Gardens and anything else that looks interesting. Go out the back door to the picnic tables (a good place for lunch or a snack before you start your hunt).<br/>
First, find Peter-peter's wife's summer place, where they have set the table for tea. In this garden there are fun things to do. <br/>
Next, down the brick road toward the best place here to find Peter Rabbit and his cousins. In this garden, find the things Peter Piper would need a peck of to pickle. <br/>
Follow the brick road up the hill to the Manor House. If you are local, stop at the Manor house for a Virginia Time Traveler's passport for more fun places to go (some of which also have more letterboxes).<br/>
Follow the brick road away from the Manor House, this time around toward the sun and the shade garden. Look for "fairy bells" in the shade garden and hummingbirds in the summer. Follow the brick road past the gazebo and find the garden on the map that doesn't need so much water. <br/>
Now you come to cross where little, medium and big goat's feet might have gone "trip, trap, trip, trap"! Who gave them trouble and where did he come from? There you will find what you are seeking.<br/>
Please let us know if you liked it!<br/>
