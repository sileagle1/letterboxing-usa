On November 16, 2002 Funhog placed the Crooked River Ranch #4<br/>
Letterbox near Terrebonne, Jefferson County, OR. This box is placed on<br/>
a plateau where you have a sweeping overview of the confluence of the<br/>
Deschutes River, entering from the left and Squaw Creek on the right.<br/>
The Department of Fish and Wildlife hoped to reintroduce native<br/>
bighorn sheep to the Squaw Creek Canyon. Crooked River Ranch has its<br/>
own herd of feral Mouflon sheep which would have to be removed before<br/>
any wild sheep could live here. In 2001, the homeowners association<br/>
held a vote and the bighorns lost, the Mouflons remain, For now, your<br/>
imagination will have to provide the sight and sound of a wild ram<br/>
traversing the rimrock.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: Just north of Terrebonne on Hwy 97, turn west on<br/>
Lower Bridge Rd. There is a highway sign for Crooked River Ranch at<br/>
this intersection. Follow the signs on to the Ranch. Once you have<br/>
made a 90 degree left turn you will be on Chinook Ave. From Chinook<br/>
follow the green and white signs to the Fire Hall. Take the first<br/>
right past the Firehall on North Rim Road. Continue on this road which<br/>
will eventually change names to Peninsula Drive. Just before Peninsula<br/>
turns to gravel turn left on North Meadow Drive, also gravel. Take the<br/>
third right on Scout Camp Trail. This road will become rough and rocky<br/>
as soon as you reach the BLM land. Don't bother to try this portion of<br/>
the road with your car if it's muddy. There are many places where the<br/>
road splits and comes back together and one clear fork. Keep left at<br/>
the fork. Drive to the end of the road and park beside the big stump.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Standing beside the stump where you parked your car,<br/>
look in the direction of 280 degrees magnetic. Your goal is a bushy<br/>
sagebrush growing on the very tip of the point. There is a gap in the<br/>
rimrock (and a trail of sorts) at 340 degrees, marked by an aging<br/>
fencepost and a fallen tree. Once at the sagebrush, take a compass<br/>
reading of 60 degrees. Walk in this direction until you have a lone<br/>
juniper at 350 degrees and your trusty stump at 85. The letterbox is<br/>
at your feet.<br/>
