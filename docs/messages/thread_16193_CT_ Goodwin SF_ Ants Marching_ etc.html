the drizzle. Finished the 4-box loop that Chuck placed for Molly <br/>
Meets Ginger. If you have not gotten there yet hurry up! They'll be <br/>
pulled in the near future and all are fun stamps!<br/>
<br/>
Also went on a trek for Ants Go Marching. We had a good time aside <br/>
from slipping on the wet rocks and roots on the white trail. Use <br/>
caution if it is raining while  you are doing this one. We chose not <br/>
to log INto most of the microboxes as it was raining and sloppy. We <br/>
went 10/10 on the ants and found an interesting suprise near the <br/>
end....<br/>
<br/>
Also grabbed Amour and tried for the DEP box but it was getting very <br/>
dark, very quickly at 6:20 or so when we went up that way. There's <br/>
always another day! And we started our new logbook -- # 3! Look for <br/>
some new boxes placed in a couple weeks when life calms down a bit!<br/>
