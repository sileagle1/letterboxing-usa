Designing, Developing and Staffing High Performance Organizations I class.  <br/>
Dr. Guido Slangen taught this course at the Rennsalaer at Hartford campus.  <br/>
We discovered letter boxing during our semester long trek to become a high <br/>
performance team.  We hope you will have as much fun finding this as we did <br/>
hiding it.  <br/>

Clues<br/>
This gentle hike takes place at the J.B. Williams Memorial Park in <br/>
Glastonbury, CT.  On this 2-mile loop you will enjoy a variety of woodlands <br/>
and water. <br/>
<br/>
1. Begin your journey at the J.B. Williams site map<br/>
2. Head towards the pond, taking the  "high road"   <br/>
3. Soon you'll have to make a decision….I hope it's the "right one" At your <br/>
first chance, take the stairs and "walk the plank"  matey. <br/>
4. Sail on to the maple and bear off to the port side<br/>
5. Stay on course and bear to the port side again at the dead Maine State tree<br/>
6. Soon you will find the upper pond.  Tour the pond clockwise.  Look to your <br/>
left if you need some relief or freshen up.  There are actually manufactured <br/>
trees in this structure.  <br/>
7. Look for the peaceful babbling brook.  Keep it starboard <br/>
8. Where the two forks meet, wet your feet, but be sure you end up on the <br/>
other side<br/>
9. Follow the trail up, up, up … (jump the hurdle)<br/>
10. Take note of the trees parallel to the trail.  Look for a single  "V" in <br/>
a tree and you cannot fail.<br/>
11. Upon success of finding the hidden treasure, enjoy the rest of the hike.  <br/>
Continue on the trail.  Head right at the next impasse, or risk ending up in <br/>
someone's yard.<br/>
12. Work your way back to the start.  <br/>
13. You'll find yourself at the tranquil lower pond.  After taking the <br/>
Lincoln Log steps, contemplate on the benches or picnic at the area behind <br/>
you. <br/>
14.  Reach the end by moving away from the pond and picnic area and over a <br/>
small bridge.<br/>
