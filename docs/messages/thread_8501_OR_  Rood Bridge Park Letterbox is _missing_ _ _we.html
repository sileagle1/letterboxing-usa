                    <div class="plaintext-content">Upon checking recently on our "Rood Bridge Park Letterbox", we have <br/>
sadly confirmed the stamp has been apparently abducted and entered <br/>
the Land Of No Return.  Thus, webmasters, please remove the box clues <br/>
from the Letterboxing.org clue sheet.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who had the chance to claim this stamp before its <br/>
disappearance, you can now flag it as a collectors item, since it <br/>
will not be reproduced.  We have chosen this option due to the <br/>
ongoing changes in the park.  Since its opening, what was once a <br/>
secluded side trail area perfect for housing the clues and stamp, has <br/>
now been converted to a high traffic area with most of the <br/>
undergrowth cleaned up and out, thus exposing letterbox type <br/>
activities.<br/>
<br/>
You can, however, expect to see a birth of more boxes in the near <br/>
future, which will be strategically located in more remote areas.<br/>
