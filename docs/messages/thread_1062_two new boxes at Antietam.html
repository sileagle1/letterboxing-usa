Antietam Letterbox Number 1<br/>
Antietam National Battlefield lies north and east of Sharpsburg, along<br/>
Md. 34 and 65. both routes intersect either U.S. 40 or 40A and<br/>
Interstate 70. The visitor center is north of Sharpsburg on Md. 65 and<br/>
is open daily except Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years Day.<br/>
<br/>
For more information about Antietam Battlefield go to the National Park<br/>
Service web page or click here.<br/>
<br/>
Once inside the park be sure to visit the museum and get a map. Visit<br/>
Dunker Church and the other monuments within walking distance. Return to<br/>
your car and take the driving tour. Go to the site where the fighting<br/>
lasted for three hours. Union Gen. Joseph Hooker reported, “Every stalk<br/>
of corn in the northern and greater part of the field was cut as closely<br/>
as could have been done with a knife and the slain lay in rows precisely<br/>
as they had stood in their ranks a few moments before.”  Park and walk<br/>
back to find the soldier from the 137th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry,<br/>
1st Brigade, 2nd Division, 6th Corps. Find the clump of rocks and trees<br/>
that he is looking towards. Find the scared tree on the right and look<br/>
for the box under a rock at the base of that tree. Please be discrete<br/>
and replace the under the rock after stamping. This area is very public.<br/>
<br/>
Antietam Letterbox Number 2<br/>
Proceed back on the driving tour enjoying each site and stop along the<br/>
way. Proceed to the site to lookout and see the battleground “as the<br/>
Georgians saw it”. From that point go back up the trail approx 26 paces<br/>
and stop. Look in the direction of the winners of the battle 349 degrees<br/>
to spot a tree trunk with 3 trees coming from it. Look to right of the<br/>
base of that tree under a flat rock for the prize that is yours to<br/>
stamp. Return the box and stamp under the rock and find the site that is<br/>
pictured on the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Hide a box of your own for me and others to find when you have finished.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
May there be lots of nuts in your life,<br/>
