Immediately as you enter Clover Mill Road, there is a trail marker for the "Indian Trail" on your left. Park directly across from the trail in the dirt area on the right side of the road. Walk across Clover Mill Road to the trail entrance. This is also the starting point for "The Lost Marker Letterbox". Follow the narrow trail through the woods and over <br/>a crumbling stone wall. Cross a small wooden bridge and continue on to a larger bridge. Cross the bridge (Watch out for the gaps!)and stand on the last plank between the 2 large pine trees. Take a compass reading of 320 degrees. Take 8 paces (count left foot only)in that direction to a dead pine tree standing tall,like a totem pole. <br/>Around the back of the tree covered with bark is the Totem Pole Letterbox. Back track to your car or continue on to find the Lost Marker Letterbox. <br/><br/><br/></p><p><br/></p><hr size="1"/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>
