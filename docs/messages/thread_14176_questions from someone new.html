<br/>
I new to letterboxing.  A friend told me about it several months ago but because my daughter was getting married I was too busy to start until last week.  I have a couple of questions!<br/>
<br/>
We were in VT, with these other friends who told us about letterboxing, and we decided to go looking for a couple of boxes.  We went to find James P. Taylor which I had the clues to and she had clues to Maine Junction.  We were unable to find either of them.  Has anyone found them recently?  Maybe we just weren't on track!  I did find another one on the way home from VT though!  My husband and I also placed a box before coming home, which leads me to my next question.<br/>
<br/>
When I got home I went on the website and signed up to become a member so I could place clues etc.  I still have not recieved an email so I can complete my account signup.  Does anyone know how long this should take?  I tried it again and now it says the email address is already being used so I think it went through partway!<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
