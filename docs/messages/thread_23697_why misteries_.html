  I guess it depends on how you look at it.  For me, it's not the number of boxes I find, but the challenge of finding them.  Mystery boxes are harder to find but it must be a great feeling to figure out where they are and find them.    <br/>

What's fun for one isn't necessarily fun for another.  There are plenty, and<br/>
will always be plenty, of boxes that aren't mystery boxes.  And they ARE fun<br/>
to find, especially for folks who are brand new to the game.  But after<br/>
finding a fair number of easy, straightforward boxes, many boxers think it's<br/>
fun to tackle the challenge of a mystery box.  Some folks are never enticed<br/>
by mystery boxes, and that's fine too  they can find their fun with the<br/>
simple boxes and even the simple boxes offer a lot to the finder.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And there are also many different motivations  many boxers don't box for<br/>
the numbers.  Some box for the experience.   Some box for the art.  Some box<br/>
for the exercise.  And some do box for the numbers.  And there again,<br/>
there's something for everyone because there are so many types of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So if you aren't interested in mystery boxes right now, no problem.  There<br/>
are plenty of other boxes out there for you.  And maybe someday you'll be<br/>
ready for the challenge of a mystery box.  Or maybe not.  And that's okay<br/>
too!<br/>
