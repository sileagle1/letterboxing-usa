Cranium H.H. was inspired by that wacky board game which we <br/>
played recently at a family gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Funny Car Bob based on a Lego creation of our 12 year old (he <br/>
drew and carved the stamp himself) was hastily made just last <br/>
night.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Snow Globe H.H., the first hitch hiker made by Happy <br/>
Mom hit the trail today.  (this is really a great stamp if I do say so <br/>
myself--Nailhead)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, South Sounders, get out there and grab em up quick!  Let us <br/>
know where they go.<br/>

As I bit into the nectarine, it had a crisp juiciness about it <br/>
that was very pleasurable - until I realized it wasn't a <br/>
nectarine at all, but A HUMAN HEAD!!<br/>

I think someone should have had the decency to tell<br/>

with potato salad in his hand, pretending he's throwing<br/>
up, is not what I call hospitality.<br/>
