<br/>
Since I'm not terribly familiar with the area the only place I can be sure to <br/>
find would be the McDonald's across the street from the entrance to <br/>
Disneyland or, the book store/ student store on the Fullerton campus. I'm thinking <br/>
between 4 and 5 o'clock on Monday June 30th for the <br/>
Mc Donald's venue or about 3:00 on Tuesday July 1 for the Fullerton venue.<br/>
<br/>
Any takers? Comments? Suggestions?<br/>

Ah ha! Willing to exchange with Disney folk, no matter how Goofy, but <br/>
did she say bibbity-bobity-boo to anybody up here? Nope! Maybe <br/>
because we are SLOfolks, sniff!, that she spurns us. Remember when <br/>

Anyways, if you ask me SLO with all the letterboxes there is better than<br/>
Anhieme any old day.<br/>

The poster of the proposed exchange was only thinking of your well-<br/>
being.  Do you know what the traffic from Anaheim to SLO is going to <br/>
be like on Tuesday afternoon?!!!<br/>
