Hi there!  I was at the School House (Mansfield) on Friday.  Everything seems to be in order there.  I keep hearing that the Grammar School LB in Coventry is missing.  I haven't checked it out yet.  </p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you all at the get-together next weekend!  </p>

<br/>The Coventry School Box is definitely missing. The people that originally placed the box have moved away from the area, and it is unlikely to be replaced.
