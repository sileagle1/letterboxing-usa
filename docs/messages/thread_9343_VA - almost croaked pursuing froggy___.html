We should have known it was not the day to leave home for long.  Dad injured <br/>
a hip playing tennis and mom had a spontaneous gusher of a nose bleed.  <br/>
But,hey, we hadn't found a box all week (we finally placed one, but...).  So <br/>
off we went to look for Froggy.<br/>
<br/>
We arrived at Claude Moore park at about 3:15 and noticed the sign on the <br/>
gate -- park closes at 5 -- hey no problem!  Everyone tumbled out of the car <br/>
and ran around the lake, over the dam (which I wouldn't have known was a dam <br/>
except for a well placed sign).  We had no luck on box #1.  We took PaPa <br/>
sized steps and MaMa sized steps, big brother, little sister and froggy <br/>
sized steps, but, no box.  We think we found the pile of sticks behind the <br/>
tree.  Could it be missing (not officially - I know, but we couldn't find <br/>
it).  Not to be discouraged -- back we went and down the other side.  We <br/>
walked through the woods, down a couple of winding paths into the woods and <br/>
we located the Oracle all nestled in safely.  The box had some water but the <br/>
baggies were dry.  We wished she could have told us to go no further!  <br/>
Feeling better with a stamp in the books, we head off in search of #3.  The <br/>
path was a little longer than we thought it would be and Dad is going a <br/>
little slowly (when little sister is way ahead of him, you KNOW something is <br/>
going on).   Hobble, hobble up the hill, through the leaves....  The sun is <br/>
going down now...it didn't seem like it was that late...  Hmmm, an injured <br/>
Dad, a very non-woodsy mom and two little ones and we have no idea where we <br/>
are...  Really looking for Blue Blazes, looking really hard.  It's getting <br/>
darker...  We found our way to the fence but where is that?  We look for <br/>
pine trees but they are scattered all over.  Even in the twilight we try and <br/>
poke under twigs, under pines.  Hmmm -- a high school football field....  <br/>
REALLY don't remember a high school nearby on the way in....  It's almost 5 <br/>
o'clock now and suddenly the sign on the gate seems a little menacing.  They <br/>
don't really shut it if there is still a mommy car in the lot, do they?  <br/>
Hobble, hobble...  through another fence, poor kids are hobbling along too <br/>
cause mom and dad will no longer let them stop to take all the stuff out of <br/>
their sneakers... hmmmm  no flashlight....  Only we could get lost in the <br/>
middle of suburbia.  Down another gravel road and YAHOO!  We see the <br/>
portapotties! We see the volley ball net!   We see the pond and the dam!  <br/>
and hot dam -- we see our car!  The last little one in the parking lot.  <br/>
Zoom into the car, through the gate and back into town.  OK -- next time -- <br/>
we will not set out so late in the day when it is getting dark so early, we <br/>
will bring a flashlight and a map of the area, we will stop as soon as we <br/>
feel injured and we will tape those little sneakers shut all along the socks <br/>
so we don't have to stop every ten steps to hop, hop, hop and empty them <br/>
out!<br/>
<br/>
So, lessons learned, an adventure had, one very nice stamp and two failed <br/>
attempts.  Well, froggy probably needed his privacy anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Kids back home watching Star Wars, aliens and battles.  They won't have <br/>
nightmares, but, mom and dad might, thinking about if we had stayed lost too <br/>
much longer....<br/>
<br/>
The oh so wimpy, but happy to be home, BeMa team.<br/>

You know, stopping for a map would have been a really good idea.  We almost <br/>
did it, but, we were so anxious to get started!  Famous last words!  Please <br/>
let us know if Froggy one is still there.  If it is, mabe we can get an idea <br/>
of how we missed it.  We retraced our route twice (mommy's version and then <br/>
daddy's version)  Well, actually three times 'cause daddy was sure mommy had <br/>
gotten it wrong until mommy showed him where he made his error....<br/>
<br/>
We also couldn't isolate which group of pine trees.  There was one nice <br/>
arking overhang of sticks that looked like an "atrium" but it was a little <br/>
far back amongst a lot of brambles!<br/>
<br/>
Next time we will follow the woman's point of view (sorry to be sexist) and <br/>
not the man's who didn't want the map and didn't want to ask the lone jogger <br/>
we saw "where the heck are we?!"<br/>
<br/>
We are ready to try again (starting very early in the day).  Please let us <br/>
know!  BeMa<br/>

<br/>
I feel your pain. My coonhound puppy Bonnie and I went at about the<br/>
same time to a Richmond-area park on Halloween to plant some boxes.<br/>
This park closes at dusk in the fall and winter months. I, too,<br/>
thought we'd zip in and zip out because I had already scouted the park<br/>
and knew exactly where I wanted to plant and knew exactly where I was<br/>
going.<br/>
<br/>
I planted a box and noticed it was getting a little dusky, but I was<br/>
still confident with my time management skills. Then I got to the part<br/>
of the park that reminds me of those wastelands that Frodo, Sam, and<br/>
Gollum fought their way through in "The Lord of the Rings," and I<br/>
realized that I had made a very big mistake.<br/>
<br/>
So I turned around and raced through the wastelands (trying to ignore<br/>
all the slithery toves gyring and gimbling in the wabe), but Bonnie<br/>
was super juiced because she is an old huntin' dog at heart and kept<br/>
wanting to stop to smell things. I admit, I spoke rather crossly to<br/>
her at times. There was no moon that night, but I didn't freak out<br/>
until I got back to the wooded area.<br/>
<br/>
People, have you ever been in the woods on a moonless night with a<br/>
hyper hound straining at the leash and only the penlight on the end of<br/>
your key ring to light your way? Oh, and lest we forget, it was also<br/>
Halloween. You think ya'll are the only ones who could get lost in<br/>
suburbia; I think I'm the only idiot dumb enough to go into the deep,<br/>
dark woods on Halloween basically by myself. Can anyone say Blair Witch?<br/>
<br/>
I totally heard the estatic joy in your words when you wrote about<br/>
seeing the volleyball courts and the parking lot lights and your car.<br/>
When I finally broke out of those woods and into the parking lot, I<br/>
thought my legs would give way. I even forgave Bonnie for trying to<br/>
pull me into a ravine at one point because she must have smelled<br/>
something tasty in it. <br/>
<br/>
Live and learn. Live and learn. I, too, carry a flashlight now and<br/>
look at my frickin' watch before I set out.<br/>

You yelled at your dog and we made our kids walk, fast, loaded up with mulch <br/>
in their sneakers!  But, we needed to make our way out.  I don't even think <br/>
Daddy BeMa has fully let on to how lost we were!  I'm glad we are not the <br/>
only ones (but I hope that it doesn't happen too much more).  BeMa<br/>

P.S.  I wonder what the park service would have done if our car was in the <br/>

When Peanunt and I were out hunting for the boxes (back when there<br/>
were only three), the park closed at 6:00.  We found #3 at 5:45 and it<br/>
took us 20 minutes to hike back to the car.  When we got back, there<br/>
was a Park Employee simply waiting by his car for the owners of the<br/>
remaining cars to return (at least we weren't the only ones late). <br/>
The gate was still open as we drove out at 6:10.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don't know if they would send out a search party if someone was<br/>
REALLY late, but at least they were nice enough to not lock us in.<br/>
