Yes, cemetaries are where we "keep" our dead, but they are for the <br/>
living.  It's the tribute of the living to the dead that make <br/>
cemetaries places that we should be respectful of.   If not that, <br/>
we'd just build a pyre and be done with it.<br/>

dog owner didn't do the right thing. <br/>

As such, we need to be respectful of the FAMILIES who have <br/>
memoralized their relatives who have passed on and keep our dogs out.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content"> There once was a time when cemetery etiquite was never a question in the Norman Rockwell-esque America I grew up in. The cemetery was for the memory and honor of the dead. Tombstones where there in memoriam of a deceased relative and were not jungle gyms for the enjoyment of feral youth brought in by uninvolved slack-jawed parents. There were no rules signs posted since no one needed to be reminded of any rule, common sense and decorum were the only rules in effect unless you wanted a firm reminder from the rest of the community. <br/>
