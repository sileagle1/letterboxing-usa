                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all, I wanted to update everyone on Monsters of New York #5, the <br/>
Phantom Cat.  Last I heard back in Aug, Delerium had found it but <br/>
noted some trail construction happening near the site.  I think this <br/>
construction may have removed the signpost mentioned in the clues <br/>
and since then I have received a few reports this box couldn't be <br/>
found.  Yesterday, Nov 15th, I got this note from Team Dakota:<br/>
<br/>
"Phantom Cat is alive and well. I looked in the wrong trees for <br/>
quite some time. The construction clue made me think that the signs <br/>
had been taken down. But once on track again it was a great spot."<br/>
<br/>
We're going to try to get the clues updated, which will be somewhat <br/>
of a challenge since we no longer live in NY, but hopefully we can <br/>
get the Cat back on track soon.<br/>

wildlife" mean what they say.  There are several people in jail this<br/>
evening for feeding deer in that park!  It was on the news tonight. <br/>
If they're found guilty, they'll get fifteen days in jail and several<br/>
hundred hours of community service.<br/>
