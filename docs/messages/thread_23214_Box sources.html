I have a few of those I've save for some time since I'm a pack-rat and <br/>
was facinated by the possibilites.  I tend to duct tape everthing but I <br/>
was worried about the simplicity of the cap as to it's ability to hold <br/>
up.  I've also considered PVC plumbing pipe with one sealed cap and one <br/>
removable that I'd hang with coat wire like a big Christmas tree <br/>
ornaminte<br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">  I went into a thrift store looking for used tupperware, blue <br/>
rubbermaids and soup thermos containers. I hit the jackpot when I found <br/>
a big bin full of these little black plastic tubes with screw on lids <br/>
that I think will fill the bill. They are six inches long and two <br/>
inches in diameter with a lid the same size as the body and were 30 <br/>
cents each.<br/>
<br/>
  I now have a big bag full of them to try out and no cammo tape will be <br/>
needed except to secure the wire hanger on a few. A section of <br/>
paper-towel tube fits just right and will secure a paper log which can <br/>
slide out easily.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  As to the lock box, I have a few of the 'sandwich' sized ones that I <br/>
think will be my main box along with the thrift store tupperwares. The <br/>
issue seems to be that lids are not replaced properly or they just pop <br/>
off under barometric pressure changes. I just haven't found a blue-lid <br/>
that wasn't too big or was the just right square sandwich size, I just <br/>
like standardized things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Another possibility would be the cheap used flashlights with the <br/>
innards removed.<br/>

 I've used Lock &amp; Lock boxes and I love 'em. They've not been out<br/>
 there long enough to really test the total waterproof part. I've<br/>
 used the smallest rectangle L&amp;L and made a log books to go in them.<br/>
 They hide so nicely, there will be more of those hidden by me! Two<br/>
 downfalls, though, they certainly aren't big enough for a hitch<br/>
 hiker to hang out in it and I haven't found a good way to cover it<br/>
 with camo tape, so it's only partially covered, or they're in a camo<br/>
 bag.<br/>

   Funny this should come up now. The Brat Pack was out boxing today. We <br/>
found<br/>
6 boxes. Of those 6 boxes, 1 was a lock n lock style. It was the ONLY <br/>
one<br/>
that was full of water.<br/>
<br/>
Just one incident, but kind of funny.<br/>

  There was one we found in Florida that was in a gutted flashlight. I don't recall it being wet inside, so I guess the seals keep it pretty dry.<br/>
