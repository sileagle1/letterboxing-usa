being said. I am not a frequent reader of the list, mostly a scanner, <br/>
So I do not keep up with the whole arguing and what is OK to say. So <br/>
I am going to post this, anyway. <br/>
<br/>
This past weekend, HelloKitty and I found :<br/>
Pinchy Pinchy right after Ace. (nice box and walk!) Found and picked <br/>
up Bookworm HH.<br/>
Then we went back and finally found 70 Million Years Ago whose link <br/>
does not work currently, but HK had the clues. This too was in good <br/>
condition and dry. <br/>
This was the nicest weekend to be out and about looking for boxes. <br/>
Thanks for planting them! <br/>
Cheers,<br/>
