left around 11am for Goliad to visit the La Bahia Mission State Park <br/>
and find SILVER EAGLE'S MEXICO FLAG from the Six Flags Over Texas <br/>
series. We toured the mission and the museum, put $1.02 in the penny <br/>
imprinting machine, looked about the grounds, then started off on <br/>
the clues to the letterbox. Unfortunately the nature trail was <br/>
blocked off with warning tape. We went back to the visitor's center <br/>
and asked about it, because I hoped there was an alternate entrance <br/>
to the trail. But they said, that the trail was completely closed <br/>
down, due to major damage from Hurricane Claudette. Besides the <br/>
trees that are broken or uprooted, the bridge on the trail was blown <br/>
or knocked off it's base somehow. :(<br/>
<br/>
So we drove on down the road to the Presidio La Bahia and General <br/>
Zaragosa's home. There we had no trouble at all locating BABY BEAR'S <br/>
REMEMBER GOLIAD letterbox. It was in good shape. I was about the 5th <br/>
signer, I think. <br/>
<br/>
Then we drove over to the ghost port town of Indianola. This was the <br/>
first time we had been there, and after reading up on the exciting <br/>
but tragic history of the previously bustling place, I was glad to <br/>
finally spend some time there. We admired the VERY tall stone statue <br/>
of La Salle, and claimed a picnic table before trying to find SILVER <br/>
EAGLE'S FRENCH FLAG letterbox, also in the Six Flags over Texas <br/>
series. We had a somewhat difficult time at first, because of what I <br/>
assume is more Hurricane Claudette damage. There were small or <br/>
medium sized limbs over and in the place where I thought the <br/>
letterbox must be. I had to remove most of them to get to the place <br/>
where the box was. But we finally got to the box and brought it back <br/>
to the table so we could do our stamping. Opening it, it had about a <br/>
one fourth cup of water inside. So I dried the inside of the box <br/>
off, and dried the book off the best I could too. It was soaked on <br/>
one edge and up two corners. But I let the pages ruffle in the sea <br/>
breeze the whole time we were there, which helped also, before <br/>
returning it to it's hiding place again. We were only the third <br/>
signers in that one. The kids loaded up on shells as a bonus! ;) <br/>
<br/>
Then we drove back and hooked up to the interstate again, and drove <br/>
to Aransas Wildlife Refuge to look for two more letterboxes. First <br/>
we searched for FUNHOG'S  HOG LAKE WHOOPER. We hiked down the grassy <br/>
trail, stopping before many steps to re-spray ourselves with <br/>
mosquito repellant. The grasslands turned into woods, and there were <br/>
so many wonderful things growing and blooming there bright purple <br/>
beauty berry, red Turk's cap, etc. really GREAT stuff! We got to <br/>
the lake and walked out on the pier to look down on a HUGE <br/>
alligator!!! This alligator was around the size of one of the <br/>
crocodiles Steve Irwin harasses! GULP! Zachary worried that he might <br/>
attack us, and indeed the pier was only inches above the water. <br/>
However, it had `walls' on it up to the handrail. The alligator was <br/>
resting, but his nostrils flaired for awhile sniffing us for a <br/>
possible food source, as we were only about three feet up from him, <br/>
looking directly down at him. I warned the kids not to disturb him, <br/>
or get the idea to poke him with the hiking stick or something. <br/>
Somewhat disappointed (!!!!), they wanted to know, "Why not?". I <br/>
pointed out that he was content where he was now, and the shore was <br/>
only about 8 feet behind us at the most did we want him to decide <br/>
to leave the water and come ashore???!  With that, we left the pier <br/>
to continue with the clues. Unfortunately, the grassy verge we were <br/>
supposed to follow, was blocked off with a big `Do Not Enter' sign. <br/>
I wondered if it was because of hurricane damage or more likely, I <br/>
thought, that the shoreline there had become much too popular with <br/>
large, sharp toothed reptiles! <br/>
<br/>
So we retraced our steps back to our van parked at the trailhead. I <br/>
got in the van only to see a tick crawling on my shirt. Yuck! I <br/>
warned the kids to be vigilant in checking themselves for ticks. <br/>
Then we drove farther into the Wildlife Refuge and came to the area <br/>
where SILVER EAGLE'S ARANSAS WHOOPER Letterbox was hidden. It is one <br/>
of the Texas Birding Trail Series. We went to the end of the long <br/>
boardwalk trail, then along the very grassy trail and cut into the <br/>
Big Tree Trail, but by that time it was getting late, and when I <br/>
calculated that the fairly long distance we had already covered was <br/>
only about halfway (one way)  in the hike, I decided to turn back <br/>
and wait for another day to return. We were all a little worried <br/>
about javalina attacks in such a thickly wooded area at dusk. Zach's <br/>
great grandmother had been accosted and chased by a pack of them not <br/>
long ago, just walking on their country property from their business <br/>
office, down the long driveway to their house. <br/>
<br/>
We were really tired, and it was close to dark anyway, and so rather <br/>
than continue on to Goose Island to try to find SILVER EAGLE'S BIG <br/>
TREE letterbox, that we weren't successful in finding before, we <br/>
started for home. In the Refuge, we had seen one HUGE alligator, 8 <br/>
deer (a buck, 5 does and 2 fawns), 3 turkeys, and lots of varieties <br/>
of other birds and butterflies. The only further excitement was when <br/>
Shabree suddenly started screaming and jumping over the last seat in <br/>
the van, writhing in terror. She had a `bug' on her. I pulled over <br/>
to the roadside, looked her over, and took a tick off of her pants <br/>
and threw it out the window. Wow!!! <br/>
<br/>
We got home around 9pm, and hope to go back to Goose Island and the <br/>
Aransas Wildlife Refuge next Saturday. We had a really great day! <br/>
Thanks Silver Eagle, Baby Bear and Funhog!!! :)<br/>
