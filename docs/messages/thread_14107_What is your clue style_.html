I have not planted very many boxes and I am kindof new to this great <br/>
hobby, but some of my clues are straight forward, others are the <br/>
kind where when you read them you don't understand, then when you <br/>
get to the spot it all falls in to place.  I like to find boxes like <br/>
this.  Not too fond of mystery boxes, although if I can figure them <br/>
out or decipher the clues it makes it even better when I find the <br/>
box, like I have really earned it!!!!!<br/>
Just my 2 cents!!!!<br/>

I agree with your point. My clues, not original but wordy, prove your <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am working on planting a series near my work and I started out writing poetry clues.  The only problem is that my poem has turned into a epic as a spin the tale of how the Hitchhiking Ghosts ended up in the Newport Back Bay.  I'm still trying to decide if I want to keep the poetry format and post the epic or if the details of the actual locations would get lost in the sheer mass of words.<br/>
<br/>
I have also realized that most of my entries in log books are the same (i.e. great spot, great stamp, great clues, etc.)  I recently went to a geocache where the owner asked for more than just a name and date so I came up with a quick limerick about my finding the cache.  I am thinking about doing all of my log entries as little poems just to break up the monotony (for myself and for others who are tired of me writing great this, great that.)<br/>

We normally try to tie the clues into the theme of the box.  Sometimes it <br/>
works, sometimes it's really stretching it!  Oh well!<br/>
<br/>
We're not very good carvers, so we try to "showcase" a little creativity in <br/>
the clues...<br/>
<br/>
On the seeking end - we've enjoyed all types!  Vague can be a little <br/>
frustrating, but, sometimes you have a "mind meld" with the clue writer, and <br/>
sometimes you just don't!  That's why it's great to have another brain or <br/>
two with you to try and figure out the clues.  This worked exceptionally <br/>
well when Daughter of the Old Dominion and I followed the trail of Sherlock <br/>
Holmes and Watson.  Just when one of us was stumped, the other would have a <br/>

Oooh!  I completely understand!  My husband and I were out a few days ago, and one clue had us looking for a number in a particular place.  My husband looked, and "got it" in two seconds flat.  Thank goodness he was there, because I would have NEVER gotten what that meant.  I would have been there all day muttering about "no stinking number ANYWHERE around here."<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness for mindmelds!<br/>
