Terra-Cotta Tangram (7)<br/>
Placed 11/2/2002 by the Cahillys of Dumont<br/>
State: New Jersey<br/>
County: Ocean (Pine Barrens)<br/>
Town: Pasadena<br/>
<br/>
Like the legendary Chinese square tile which broke into seven <br/>
pieces, thus creating the tangram puzzle, this 3  " square design <br/>
has been cut into 5 triangles, a square and a parallelogram, and <br/>
scattered among seven boxes for you to find. Collect them all and <br/>
solve the tangram to restore the image. (Count as seven boxes, since <br/>
each involves a search.)<br/>
<br/>
Follow the trail of the fast Blue Comet, of the Jersey Central <br/>
Railroad, to where it crosses Pasadena Road. Between this point and <br/>
Whiting, the hamlet of Pasadena once thrived. Here was the Pasadena <br/>
Terra Cotta Company. A fire destroyed the works and put the company <br/>
out of business. Today the ruins are a fascinating place to wander <br/>
and ponder. Just be very, very careful, as they contain many dangers <br/>
to trip over or fall into. Keep dogs and unruly children on leashes.<br/>
<br/>
The path begins 62 steps WSW of utility pole JC1726MC on Pasadena <br/>
Road. Head away from the road. Stand in the middle of the tracks and <br/>
face Chatsworth at 232 degrees. Take 12 steps to a clump of small <br/>
pines on the left and look under the rail for Box #1.<br/>
<br/>
Go halfway back up the tracks to the continuation of the path to the <br/>
left. Cross the sand road. From the tree with the board, continue <br/>
ten steps, to a group of three pin oaks on the right. Look under the <br/>
log between them for Box #2.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on the trail. Soon after the ruins come into view, at the <br/>
bend in the trail, take the fire cut to the right. You will then <br/>
pass a cellar hole on the right and come to a pile of moldering <br/>
ruins. Sight 116 degrees between the white oak and the sassafras, <br/>
take four steps and look under a rock for Box #3.<br/>
<br/>
Take 27 more steps down the fire cut. At 274 degrees, bushwhack 41 <br/>
steps. Look at the inside corner of the remains at your feet for Box <br/>
#4.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy a wander among and around the ruins, and make your way to <br/>
their SW corner. Not far away is a picturesque log. Look where the <br/>
log meets the wall for Box #5.<br/>
<br/>
Walk along the wall at 112 degrees to the end and then another 18 <br/>
steps (don't trip on the bolt!) to the base of the well-weathered, <br/>
multi-trunked stump for Box #6.<br/>
<br/>
Take 25 steps at 76 degrees to the easternmost chunk of foundation. <br/>
Stand on it and look westish down the line of chunks. Box #7 is on <br/>
the far side of the third chunk you see in front of you.<br/>
<br/>
After stamping in, please retrace your steps carefully to return the <br/>
boxes to their hiding places. Hide them well, as this site has been <br/>
pretty heavily trafficked by paintballers, who move things around.<br/>
