                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just received an email from a new boxer who came across these two<br/>
hitchers with separate boxes in central MA. As she didn't know what to<br/>
do with  them, she left them in place.<br/>
<br/>
Mysteriously, she says she found my email address in Sparky and so<br/>
assumed it was mine. I've never heard of, let alone stamped into,<br/>
Sparky, so I'm very curious how this could be, Anyone have a clue? The<br/>
stamp for Sparky is described as "a red circle with flames inside."<br/>
<br/>
If you are the owner of either of these hitchers, contact me, and I'll<br/>
be happy to let you know the name of the last box it was spotted with.<br/>
