                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was thinking about the redesigning of the website, and the things <br/>
that I've enjoyed/had troubles with since starting this hobby.  I <br/>
honestly think the site is fabulous and love the old world look-- so <br/>
many things in our culture have moved away from a love of the old, <br/>
the proven, the time-honored.  There's just nothing in the world <br/>
quite like an old leather book.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But, I digress.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
One thing I DO think might benefit the hobby is a solution to this <br/>
County map thing.  I'm sure it's a pain in the butt for Wes and it's <br/>
also aggravating to those using the maps that they aren't right.  <br/>
Here's an idea!<br/>
<br/>
What if collectively we decided to replace the maps that are <br/>
currently up there with the county maps that I found for printing?<br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to color in each county as it's added, having a <br/>
good printable map with the counties identified would be more help.  <br/>
THEN, the folks could do like I do....print the map and mark the <br/>
counties in by the identification on the clues page.<br/>
<br/>
This would mean they'd only have to be loaded ONCE....no need for Wes <br/>
to find, color in, update, or anything else AND it would provide real <br/>
information to those who need it.<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking about this all morning and believe it could really <br/>
help.  But, you guys are the old hands here.  I'll leave the <br/>
decisions up to you.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
The content of all the pages will still be provided by LbNA.  So, maps, clue<br/>
layouts, etc. will not change [as a result of the design contest...] but the<br/>
look of all the pages will.<br/>
<br/>
You are creating a new header, sidebars, and/or footer, with appropriate<br/>
graphics.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Again, if you have any questions, please let me know.<br/>
