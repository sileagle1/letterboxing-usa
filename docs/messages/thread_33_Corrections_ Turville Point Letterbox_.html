                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK ~ I'll have to 'fess up now. Please be kind, but I<br/>
kinda took a wrong turn when I went out to test clues for<br/>
the letterbox this weekend. My kids will never let me live<br/>
it down, I think. The first entry in their letterbox journals ~<br/>
oh, it's just too comic-horrible to think about!<br/>
I realized while on the trail that I would have to rewrite with<br/>
just a couple more descriptive details ~ when I wrote the<br/>
clues I was using a pedometer, and when I went back I didn't<br/>
take it with me, and now it turns out that I am also distance-<br/>
challenged. So, I want to add a bit to the clues so that you<br/>
won't need to know how far you've gone to follow them!<br/>
Correction first, then I'll include the whole<br/>
set of clues below that...<br/>
<br/>
Correction: To get to the park, turn right on Olin Turville Ct.<br/>
(the street is E. Olin Ave. to the left, and Olin Turville Ct. to the<br/>
right.) The Conservation Park parking lot is the first one.<br/>

Madison Tribute Series<br/>
Letterbox #1 - David Lewis Crosby <br/>
<br/>
Turville Point Conservation Park<br/>
Olin Turville Ct., Madison WI<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is dedicated to the memory of <br/>
David Lewis Crosby of the Madison Chamber Orchestra,<br/>
in gratitude for the magic he created at Madison's<br/>
Concerts on the Square. <br/>
<br/>
The parking lot for the conservation park is to<br/>
the south of the main entrance of Olin Turville Park,<br/>
the first lot after turning onto Olin Turville Ct.<br/>
The trail heads east from the parking lot. <br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Follow the main trail from the parking lot about 1/10th mile<br/>
to a major fork in the trail where it is clear that you must<br/>
go left or right. (There are trails that split off/converge before<br/>
this, but keep heading east on the main trail). In front of you <br/>
is a very large fallen tree. Take the trail to the left.<br/>
At the next fork in the trail (about 2/10th mile from start, the<br/>
trail intersection looks like a "T"), take the trail going to the right. <br/>
The trail meanders along the lake to the left and sometimes <br/>
into the woods to the right. Eventually you will walk through <br/>
a large stand of  trees ~ the path goes through this stand to<br/>
the left back towards the lake.<br/>
About =BD mile from the start of the trail, and very shortly after<br/>
leaving the stand of trees, you will see a tiny short footpath<br/>
leading up to a view of the lake. At the top of this path is<br/>
a ring of stones and the tall jagged remains of a fire-charred<br/>
tree. After admiring the skyline view of central Madison,<br/>
which includes the State Capitol where the Concerts on the <br/>
Square take place, turn and look inside the tree for the letterbox.<br/>
Notes: <br/>
Turville Point Conservation Park is about .5 mi. north<br/>
from the John Nolan Drive exit off Hwy 12-18, turn right<br/>
on Olin Turville Ct. (East Olin Ave) from John Nolan Drive.<br/>
If you=92d like to bike, the trail is about 2 miles from <br/>
Williamson Bicycle Works, which is at the other end of<br/>
John Nolan Drive. This store rents bikes and other <br/>
equipment, and the bike path practically leaves from<br/>
their door! The park allows no bikes, though I presume<br/>
it would be fine to walk them through. <br/>
