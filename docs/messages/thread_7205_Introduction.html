I can't think of a better educational opportunity than letterboxing! You<br/>
can learn geography, geology, botany, entymology, history, navigational<br/>
skills, reading, writing, art...the possibilities are endless! Please<br/>
tell all of your homeschooling associates, too -- if you meet with larger <br/>
groups occasionally, you could make that gathering a letterboxing event!<br/>

Hi Roxanne, I'm passing through your way enroute to Louisville in the <br/>
end of October maybe I can leave a box in my wake. Can you name a <br/>
couple towns or parks or a highway exit you are near for me to look <br/>
at on my map. It will be a quick and easy as I need to get to the <br/>
convention ( FFA) but at least another to hunt for. I would also love <br/>
to look for one of yours if you had a quick and easy 1/2 hour or so <br/>
box. A stretch of the legs in the long trip might be  just what is <br/>
needed. <br/>
    I don't homeschool but use the letterboxing as a 4-H activity <br/>
can't get enough of that read and follow directions lessons in can we!<br/>

by reading an article in Family Fun magazine.  We are really excited <br/>
about doing this as our kids are 6 and 4.  Letterboxing looks like a <br/>
great activity for the whole family to enjoy and a great way to get out <br/>
of the house and away from the lull of the TV set!<br/>
<br/>
We purchased our stamp-making materials and logbooks today and we <br/>
already have ideas in mind for what to create.  We live in Austin, TX <br/>
and are going to try our first finds this Saturday.<br/>

Anyway, I just joined the mailing list, so I wanted to introduce myself.<br/>

 I am really glad to see another Texan here. There are not nearly <br/>
enough Texas letterboxers. I came to letterboxing through that <br/>
article in Family Fun too, so have only been letterboxing since the <br/>
first week of August. <br/>
 If you ever get farther south, I hope you will look for some of the <br/>
boxes I have placed. So far there have been no other letterboxers <br/>
near the area to find them. <br/>
 I love your enthusiasm! I know you and your family will have a <br/>
GREAT time!<br/>

<br/>
This is a wonderful past-time for all abilities and ages. At the <br/>
NorCal Event we had neonates to Korean War vets. <br/>
<br/>
It can be both challenging physically and mentally. Ryan Carpenter <br/>
puts boxes up on top of mountains. Legerdemaine puts out the sparsest <br/>
clues imaginable. I encrypt mine in code but put the boxes where <br/>
someone in a wheelchair could get to them.<br/>
<br/>
It teaches navigation. Compass reading does help. We have had a big <br/>
debate about a pace being one step or two. No consensus on it. I tend <br/>
to put "single paces" in my clues.<br/>
<br/>
It encourages art. As you might see by the on-going poll, some of us <br/>
believe that even the crudest stamp carved by a child is preferrable <br/>
to a fancy store-bought one. Most of us are happy to teach carving.<br/>
<br/>
We get pretty good at hiding. I even make fake rocks and carve out <br/>
stones to put boxes into. Microboxes, those in film cannisters, can <br/>
be held by Velcro or magnets. We have made boxes out of PVC pipe.  <br/>
<br/>
I love going out with a small group to hunt and to plant stamps. I <br/>
like the companionship and safety. We are learning to be pretty good <br/>
on hikes and such. Rattlesnakes and Black Widows, poison ivy and <br/>
slippery rocks, all have to be coped with. We take plenty of water, <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
There are no rules, folks, not in the North American Letterboxing. <br/>
Biggest thing is to play nice. <br/>
<br/>
We are glad to have you aboard and hope to find your boxes next time <br/>
I am in Austin. (Used to live on Speedway.)<br/>

<br/>
Like you, I read the FF article and went out that evening to find our first<br/>
box, lol.  We have three--a six year old, a four year old and a 17 month<br/>
old.  The older two love "treasure  hunting" and have gotten the hang of it<br/>
rather quickly--including the need for discretion.  I am sure you will enjoy<br/>
it.  I had the smae thoguth you did--what a great way to get out away from<br/>
that dang boob tube!  Myhusband is not intrigued by boxing, but loves the<br/>
hiking, so he ususlaly ends up chasing the little one while the older ones<br/>
and I stamp in.  IT is perfect for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
My adivce is to read the clues carefuly and start with easy boxes,<br/>
preferably that you can confirm.  Initially, my kids  were extremely<br/>
disappointed to not find a box.  Now they understand that is part of the<br/>
hunt, and can handle it.  I also tend to make sure we visit the playgorund<br/>
or local ice-cream shop after any longish hunts (more than one box, lol) as<br/>
a reward.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure to take lots of pictures, (tho not of the actual site--no<br/>
spoiling!!)  My kids love to look through our scrap book and talk about the<br/>
various stamps and  hikes we have had.  The older two have their own<br/>
(commercial) stamps and log books, and my 6yo even lables and journals<br/>
herself.  Both can read a compass better than I (Ok, that is not a huge<br/>
acheivement, lol) and are learning so many other things.  Perhaps the most<br/>
useful is that our repugnance to spiders has decreased significantly.  Be<br/>
wary of poison Ivy etc. tho--I got a nasty case one weekend due to sheer<br/>
carelessness.  Fortunately, no one else was as stupid.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on about the joys and trials of boixng with little ones.<br/>
I am gld there is another family on the list with the same age kids.  Can't<br/>
wait to share your adventures.<br/>

they are from Texas!  When I first started a little over<br/>
a year ago, there were only about 10 letterboxes in the whole<br/>
state and less than 5 letterboxers.  Now there are over 100<br/>
boxes and maybe 15 or so letterboxers, so we are growing slow<br/>
but sure.  I have tried to place my boxes over as much of<br/>
Texas as I can to lure future letterboxers into the hobby,<br/>
and this includes the Austin area.  In fact, Austin is quite<br/>
the hotbed for letterboxes with several around town and many<br/>
within 1 hour drive (e.g. Bastrop).  Some should be easy to<br/>
find (my clues and Baby Bear's are very straight-forward) with <br/>
minimal walking and others will be more challenging.  I, too <br/>
have kids so I know long hikes and hard-to-find boxes are <br/>
discouraging when I go with them, so plan accordingly.  Have <br/>
fun and I look forward to finding your letterboxes some day!<br/>

P.S. I have thought about organizing a letterboxing event<br/>
if and when Texas gets enough letterboxers.  We may now<br/>
have enough to give it a try, maybe this winter.  Keep <br/>
watching on this talklist for future information.<br/>

Yet another Texas letterboxer here - Northeast part of<br/>
the state!  My kids (boy 7 and girl 16) and I have<br/>
been at it casually for awhile, but we finally got my<br/>
husband hooked over Labor Day.  He's working on<br/>
designing his first stamp right now and has an - ahem<br/>
- interesting - idea for where and how to plant the<br/>
box it goes with.<br/>
<br/>
Now that my hubby is hooked, we never know when he's<br/>
going to get up and say "Let's go!"  Austin is one of<br/>
my favorites cities in the state, so you never know if<br/>
and when we'll wind up in your area, so keep us all<br/>
posted on your adventure!<br/>
