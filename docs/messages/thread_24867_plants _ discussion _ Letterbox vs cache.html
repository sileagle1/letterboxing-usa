the method/container used to hide it is clever or not - it's about <br/>
the journey to get there.  Part of what makes the journey special is <br/>
a well written clue (requiring some research to solve) and an <br/>
interesting location.  It gets even better when the clue is <br/>
exceptional and the location is superb..and then the journey becomes <br/>
an adventure.  The clue...the location...the journey..the adventure.  <br/>
All play a significant part. And when you are fortunate to find a <br/>
letterbox with a hand carved stamp and homemade logbook to match, <br/>
which shows the stamps and history of those before you, you are then <br/>
part of an even bigger adventure as played out over time...all the <br/>
way back to Cranmere.  You just don't get that from punching numbers <br/>
into a GPS so you can locate a cache filled with trinkets and a 3x5 <br/>
lined memo pad with peoples names scrawled in it line after line....<br/>

&gt; &gt; boxes, boxes placed simply to place a box, but at the same time <br/>

&gt; &gt; are a ton of boxes out there that are extremely innovative, <br/>
clever <br/>

&gt; &gt; creative.  I think the way in which letterboxing is done, with <br/>
&gt; clues and <br/>
&gt; &gt; a stamp, alone allows for better boxes that I can imagine being <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The best thing for you to do, instead of asking repeated <br/>

&gt; &gt; comparing letterboxing to geocaching, is to simply get out there <br/>

&gt; &gt; box, and see what you find.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with most of what you say. That is pretty much what I enjoy <br/>
about letterbxing. However, don't be too quick to count out the <br/>
cleverness of the geochachers Let me illustrate with an example.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of using series GC'ers like to use multi-caches, usaully you <br/>
find the first cache which will give you information on how to find <br/>
the next. There is a multi-cache in the Lake George region that is a <br/>
3 cache multi-cache and what this person did was to locacte them <br/>
along a trail to the top of Sleeping Beauty Mt. I don't want to give <br/>
too much away, but the first cache first gives you the cooords for <br/>
the next cache and then tells you to take a key with you. It was a <br/>
drawing with holes cut into it at different spots. There were 20 or <br/>
so in the box all laminated! Then you found the next cache, locacted <br/>
along the trail, but at a very interesting locaction and it ended up <br/>
being a very creative hide. This one gave you the coords for the next <br/>
and final cache with instruction to use the key and write down the <br/>
numbers that the key indicacted when you placed it over another <br/>
drawing. Then the final, which was literally located in an enchanted <br/>
spot, one that only a hunter would find, and there was the final <br/>
cache with and absolutely beautiful painting on the outside of the <br/>
ammo cantainer which was locked and you had to use the information <br/>
from the key to solve a riddle that was posted on the origial clues <br/>
to figure out the combination, which took me a half an hour. Inside <br/>
were the usaul trinkes, but it also held a geocoin a nice metal one <br/>
that is trackable (most like a HH in the Lb world), that was <br/>
beautiful. <br/>
<br/>
This so far is the most creative, fun and thoughtful cache or <br/>
letterbox I have found to date. What I am saying is that there are <br/>
aspects to geocaching that are as appealling to those who seek <br/>
challenging and creative hides. It is jsut different than <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I personally like both and actually like letterboxing a little <br/>
better. One thing that I don't do is both at the same time. I either <br/>
do one or the other.<br/>

land in places that you would never dream of! I have often found<br/>
myself on paths that only the neighborhood locals know about. these<br/>
are such a treasure. I have discovered Bronze statues and hidden ponds<br/>
in places that I pass all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Both activities give you a moment in our busy lives to pause and take<br/>
in the world around us.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the geocaching podcasts include letterboxing. My own Venture<br/>
crew does both.<br/>
<br/>
I just like the thought of taking the time to smell the roses.<br/>
