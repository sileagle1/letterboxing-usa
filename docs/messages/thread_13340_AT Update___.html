                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've now made it to Dalesville, Virginia--about 1/3 the Appalachian Trail now behind me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently sitting in front of a Krogers having just bought a bunch of food to get me the next 130 miles or so, but can't quite get it all in my pack.  So I'm eating as much of it now to get it down a bit and killing time by writing silly messages like this.<br/>
<br/>
So far I've eaten a bunch of the pre-cut watermelon, four lemon-poppy seed muffins, a can of peaches, some M&amp;Ms, and a 450 mL bottle of apple juice.   Yum yum!  Next up, the Doritos.  After I let some of that watermelon digest a bit.<br/>
<br/>
It's currently a swealtering 79 degrees here, according to the marque of the bank across the street, with partly cloudy skies.  Rather a relief from the f***ing record rainfall that dumped on the trail during the month of May.  A bit of blue skies and warmth is a nice change of pace.<br/>
<br/>
Carpe diem!<br/>

Well for the Love of God, bring some of those Clear Skies with <br/>
you up into the Delaware Valley! <br/>
<br/>
It's been so long since we've seen the Sun, our eyes are all <br/>
dilated. It's creepy!<br/>
<br/>
(Glad to hear you're making good progress, despite the weather)<br/>
