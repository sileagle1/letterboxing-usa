<br/>
I've read that Letterboxing is a "no rules" activity so I realize it varies by person.  The LBNA site says: <br/>
<br/>
Hitchhikers count when initially planted by there (sic) creator, and count as found when anyone else finds them.<br/>
<br/>
The letterboxing.info site says:<br/>
Hitchhikers you pick up in letterboxes can also be recorded as finds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I personally think of a letterbox as something that includes clues, so would not count postal letterboxes or hitchhikers as part of my own PFX count.  I maintain a separate count for hitchhikers and enjoy looking at the website that shows their travels. I consider them a "bonus" but not something I created or solved clues for.<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; If you make &amp; send a Postal LB - does it count as a placed?<br/>
&gt; If you find receive a postal LB, does it count as a find?<br/>
<br/>
According to Article 3.32.5, in section C of the Letterboxing Rules <br/>
of Counting Boxes, Postal Letterboxes do not count as either a find <br/>
nor placed for anyone.  It clearly states, "Any box that comes to <br/>
you, clearly, is not 'found' and should not be counted as such."  <br/>
Placed boxes, defined in sub-section B.2, are boxes that 'are created <br/>
and hidden in such a way that anybody that wants to get can get it'.  <br/>
Since postal boxes are, by design, intended only for certain people <br/>
on 'mailing lists', they cannot be counted as placed.<br/>
<br/>
However, the little-known sub-section of S.h.1.T, does state that for <br/>
any box that does not qualify as a find or placed, a seperate count <br/>
may be used to track such boxes, although there are--as of yet--no <br/>
official rules for how those boxes should be counted, except to say <br/>
they should be counted separately.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How do you count found hitchhikers?<br/>
<br/>
Using the definition for 'found' boxes as stated in Article 3.32.5, <br/>
section C (i.e. "Any box that comes to you is not 'found'), <br/>
hitchhikers, would, in fact, be counted as finds.  The box was not <br/>
hidden with the intention of going to a specific boxer, and even if <br/>
that was the *intention*, it clearly cannot be guaranteed unless the <br/>
person who is doing the 'finding' is with the person doing <br/>
the 'hiding'.  If such an event were to happen, the box could not be <br/>
counted as a placed or find by either party, since it was 'designed' <br/>
for only a certain person to get with without the possibility of <br/>
anyone else getting a crack at the box.<br/>
<br/>
However, because of Article 5.23, Section E (that states no box may <br/>
be counted more than once under any circumstances), a person who <br/>
finds a hitchhiker then releases it again may not count the box as a <br/>
placed box--since it's already being counted as a find.  However, the <br/>
person that originally created the hitchhiker, since they cannot <br/>
claim the box as a find, may claim it as a placed box.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this clears up any confusion!  =)<br/>

as a plant.  I put a lot of time and effort into it-just as much, if not <br/>
more than I do my other boxes.  I don't plan on doing many, so I <br/>
don't feel it will interrupt anything.  I'm not even sure I will do <br/>
another one.<br/>
<br/>
I've been more cautious regarding counting PLB's as finds.  I did <br/>
count the first one or two that I found, but they have become so <br/>
much more common than I expected and I never felt entirely <br/>
comfortable with it in the first place.  One or two was one thing, <br/>
but a whole slew of them somehow feels a bit like cheating.  It <br/>
was really tempting at first since I have found pretty much every <br/>
letterbox within several hours of driving b/c of the sparseness of <br/>
other boxers, but I'm moving back to not counting them anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I do, however, just count my HH's.  I am not enough into the <br/>
whole PFX count thing to really go beyond PFX and E (although I <br/>
really like Psychomommy's lizard count).  <br/>
