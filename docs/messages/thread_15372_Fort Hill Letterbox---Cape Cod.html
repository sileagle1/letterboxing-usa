in Eastham on Cape Cod last weekend.  We enjoyed reading the many <br/>
messages and greetings from those who followed our clues and took a <br/>
walk at this wonderful place.  Since our last visit this spring <br/>
the "sunny pin" has apparently been removed but you still should be <br/>
able to find your prize without too much trouble as many apparently <br/>
have recently.  Try doing what we did last Sunday---get up early, go <br/>
to the Hole in One Donut shop on Route 6 for some fresh Jelly Sticks <br/>
and coffee, take your walk and find your prize, then treat yourself <br/>
to breakfast with a view from the bench at the top of Fort Hill.  It <br/>
always reminds the5coolcats that life is good!<br/>
