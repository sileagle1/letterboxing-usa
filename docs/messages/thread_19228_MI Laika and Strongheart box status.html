I visited these boxes at Maybury rec area in Northville MI for <br/>
maintainence. There is a new log book in the Strongheart box and the <br/>
contents are now nice and dry.  Laika has remained dry and didn't <br/>
really require maintainence.Thanks to those who emailed me regarding <br/>
the status of these boxes, and thanks to all who stamped in. I really <br/>
enjoyed seeing all of the stamps and reading your comments. <br/>
I searched for the Lovebirds letterbox, which is located in the same <br/>
park, but couldn't find it. Has anyone else found it recently? Pleae <br/>
