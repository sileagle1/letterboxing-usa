Welcome back!!! So sorry we missed your stamp carving class in Essex <br/>
CT this summer. If anyone hasn't visted yet, Ruthann has the BEST how-<br/>
to guide for carving stamps in the universe!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to drop a line to say hello, Ruthann.  I am a relatively <br/>
new letterboxer over on the other side of Michigan.  Since the <br/>
hunting options are a bit limited over here, I'm concentrating on <br/>
getting some boxes placed and have been incessantly running at the <br/>
mouth to my friends and family, hoping to drum up some interest - <br/>
i.e. somebody to go out and find the boxes I have so diligently <br/>
placed and in return plant some that I can look for ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You have a great web site, I enjoyed your carvings (and Teddy's) and <br/>
found the information very helpful, as stamp carving is new for me <br/>
too.  I also have enjoyed reading through your clues and find them <br/>
very intersting.  I like it when the clues are thoughtful and a <br/>
little out of the ordinary, "go here, go there..."  Looking forward <br/>
to getting over to the East side of Michigan to look for some of your <br/>
boxes this fall.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for getting my 2 newest boxes in Grand Haven up on the LbNA <br/>
page so quickly!  Welcome back!<br/>
