Hi there yall,..<br/>
have been boxing for a couple of weeks now,.. and as a non-driver, <br/>
and <br/>
generally available to hike only at night I find my hunting options <br/>
pretty <br/>
limited.<br/>
<br/>
I would really like to find some truly urban boxes, and there are few <br/>
in my <br/>
area, so I have been working on planting one.<br/>
<br/>
I have the stamp carved and the book picked out and a very fancy <br/>
little <br/>
waterproof container for it,...<br/>
but Before I go stomping off to where I am thinking about planting <br/>
it,.. <br/>
iwanted to know what people's experiences had been with urban boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I mean really urban boxes,.. not out in the suburban boonies half a <br/>
mile <br/>
from another living sole urban,..<br/>
<br/>
I have a spot picked out that I think is an amazing little <br/>
treasure,...<br/>
from my old neighborhood,<br/>
and aside from the obvious admonitions abotu not putting it in too <br/>
heavily <br/>
traveled a spot,.. (gonna request this one only be cheked in the wee <br/>
hours,.. and then awfully subtley)<br/>
I wanted your advices on problems youhave had with urban boxes you <br/>
have <br/>
planted, (obviously they get stolen,.. but which ones worked,.. and <br/>
why did <br/>
they go missing,.. and how did you fix it, and so on)<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to hearing from yall,<br/>

--- In letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com, "Knotty Klown!" <br/>
&gt; I wanted your advices on problems you have had with urban boxes <br/>
<br/>
I created a downtown series in Portland, Maine. I love this waterfront<br/>
city and to honor my many favorite locales, I decided to create<br/>
microboxes. They're all housed in film canisters. No logbooks. 15<br/>
boxes total with the last box in the series being hid in a<br/>
not-so-urban area so that it could sustain a larger box with a regular<br/>
sized logbook for folks to record their (gripes) finds and other comments.<br/>
<br/>
I've had a difficult time with this series. It was tricky to hide<br/>
them, even harder to find them, and now it is difficult for me to<br/>
replace them when they are missing. I'm living further away. I'd<br/>
definitely recommend that you're close to the city area so as to check<br/>
on them. Urban boxes may or may not (depending on the size and<br/>
location) need far more babysitting than regular boxes that see fewer<br/>
traffic.<br/>
<br/>
The reasoning behind film canisters and only a stamp inside was to<br/>
minimize the chance of suspicion as to the contents and/or the placer.<br/>
With no contact information within the box it is nearly impossible for<br/>
a casual (non-letterboxer) finder to discern what the object is. I<br/>
think that is good and bad.<br/>
<br/>
So, based on my experience, make sure that you're able to check on the<br/>
box. I included a very detailed information sheet with the clues that<br/>
are passed on from letterboxer to letterboxer - the clues are not<br/>
maintained online in any format other than a listing and perhaps the<br/>
status if necessary. The instructions detailed the size of the stamps,<br/>
the boxes, and how to search in a responsible way as not to draw<br/>
attention to yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on urban boxing.<br/>
It is tricky!<br/>

Not to speak ill of LB, but you might try geocaching. I have a friend who is <br/>
without a car and works all day just like you. He's recently started <br/>
geocaching and is really enjoying it. Most caches are in urban areas. <br/>
Ridiculiously urban areas. He hit 6 in his neighborhood his first night...of <br/>
course he was out until 2 am.<br/>

P.S. My friend still boxes with me on the weekend, so there's hope. : )<br/>

I don't say gardners because it's not in a park or garden. I replaced it and it stayed all winter in good shape and is still there. If they replace those plants, it may be found again. I'll have to check it as often as I can. <br/>

Another boxer has quite a few urban boxes in Washington DC also, so again,  it *can* be done. You don't have to resort to geocaching.  heh, heh......I work all day and don't have a car. Actually if you are doing really urban boxes, having a car shouldn't matter. You should be able to walk and/or use public transportation. Boxing outside the city in rural areas is where not having a car turns into a pain, at least for me. <br/>
