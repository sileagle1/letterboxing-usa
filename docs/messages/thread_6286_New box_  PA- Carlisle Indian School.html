CARLISLE INDIAN SCHOOL (1879-1918) <br/>
Biddle Mission Park<br/>
Carlisle, Pennsylvania<br/>
Cumberland County, south central PA<br/>

PLANTED: July 16, 2002 by the Drakes and their dog Buddy<br/>

<br/>
Biddle Mission Park is a 5-acre park on East North Street in downtown <br/>
Carlisle, PA, behind the Jaycee's building.  The park is not far from <br/>
the Carlisle Barracks, the home of the Carlisle Indian School.  <br/>
Because of tight security this letterbox was placed in the nearest <br/>
park so that everyone may find it.  <br/>
<br/>
Richard Henry Pratt founded the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in <br/>
1879 as the first off-reservation government boarding school for <br/>
Native American Indian Children. These schools were set up <br/>
to "Americanize" the Native American, who were taken from their <br/>
families and brought here.  The Carlisle school, operated by the U.S. <br/>
Army, served as a model for dozens of schools throughout the U.S., <br/>
some of which are still running today. Jim Thorpe is it's most famous <br/>
student. Geronimo's children were also students here. Visit the <br/>
Cumberland County Historical Society to see their extensive <br/>
collection about the "Indian School."  <br/>
<br/>
This stamp is a rough replicate of a design drawn by one of the <br/>
students for title page of the school's newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
<br/>
Enter the park from East North Street- the park entrance shares the <br/>
driveway to the Jaycee's building.  Park in the upper parking lot, <br/>
next to the basketball court.  <br/>
<br/>
 Find the large sister tree named "Megan" and "Judy" toward the rear <br/>
of the park near the LeTort Spring Run.  In its crotch, you'll find <br/>
what you seek.  It is covered with bark to camouflage, please recover <br/>
after you stamp in. <br/>
<br/>
 (HINT: if you still haven't found it and are still reading, site 285 <br/>
degrees from the basketball hoop to the large tree near the spring- <br/>
it's around the back of the tree at eye-level).<br/>
