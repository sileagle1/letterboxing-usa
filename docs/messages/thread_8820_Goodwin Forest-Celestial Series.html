I started out with the "Bear Family Box" there on the natchaug trail <br/>
then went off to find Chuck's Celestial series-- Jake and I had a <br/>
great time--he swam most of the way around the lake!! Nutty Lab!!!<br/>
I found all 6 boxes--all in good shape--I was the 2nd visitor--I <br/>
think Pam and Darrin from Manchester found 2 of Chuck's boxes by <br/>
mistake!!<br/>
I also found 4 out of 10 "Ants go Marching" on the way.  I'll have to <br/>
go back and find the rest now! I also found 2 more letterboxes by <br/>
accident--"the Troll" and the "letterboxing adventure" by EMS--thanks <br/>
chuck for fixing up the box! And I also found the Homesick Moose <br/>
Hitch-hiker( in box 1 of the celestial series)  QUITE THE LUCRATIVE <br/>
DAY!!  12 boxes and a Hitchiker in 3hours or so!! not bad!<br/>
Irish Mum<br/>
P.S. Love the series Chuck! Great Hike! <br/>
