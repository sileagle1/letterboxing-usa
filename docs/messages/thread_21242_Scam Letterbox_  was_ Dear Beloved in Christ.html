&gt; &gt; Dear Beloved in Christ,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It is by the grace of God that I received<br/>
&gt; &gt; Christ,knowing the truth and <br/>
&gt; &gt; the truth have set me free.Having known the truth, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; had no choice than <br/>
&gt; &gt; to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for<br/>
&gt; &gt; eternal life and <br/>
&gt; &gt; in the sight of man for witness of Gods mercy and<br/>
&gt; &gt; glory upon my life.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have the pleasure to share my testimony with<br/>
&gt; &gt; you,having seen your <br/>
&gt; &gt; contact from the Internet. I am BARRISTER MIKE ADE,the<br/>
&gt; &gt; legal adviser to <br/>
&gt; &gt; late Mr. and Mrs. Bright Williams,a British couple<br/>
&gt; &gt; that lived in my <br/>
&gt; &gt; Country Nigeria for 25 years before they both died in<br/>
&gt; &gt; a plane crash <br/>
&gt; &gt; late last year. These couple were good Christians,<br/>
&gt; &gt; they were so <br/>
&gt; &gt; dedicated to God but they had no child till they died.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Throughout their <br/>
&gt; &gt; stay in my country, they acquired a lot of properties<br/>
&gt; &gt; like lands, house <br/>
&gt; &gt; properties, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As their legal adviser, before their death, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; husband Mr. Bright <br/>
&gt; &gt; Williams instructed me to write his WILL. Because they<br/>
&gt; &gt; had no child, <br/>
&gt; &gt; they dedicated their wealth to God. According to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; WILL, the <br/>
&gt; &gt; properties have to be sold and the money be given out<br/>
&gt; &gt; to a ministry for <br/>
&gt; &gt; the work of God. As their legal adviser, all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; documents for the <br/>
&gt; &gt; properties were in my care.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; He gave me the authority to sell the properties and<br/>
&gt; &gt; give out the fund <br/>
&gt; &gt; to the Ministries for the work of God.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; To cut the story short, I sold all the properties<br/>
&gt; &gt; after their death, as <br/>
&gt; &gt; instructed by my client,Mr. Bright Williams before his<br/>
&gt; &gt; death.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And as matter of fact, after I sold all their<br/>
&gt; &gt; properties,expectedly, I <br/>
&gt; &gt; realized a huge amount of money that runs into<br/>
&gt; &gt; millions of dollars,and <br/>
&gt; &gt; what supposed to be the percentage interest of my<br/>
&gt; &gt; right legal fee was <br/>
&gt; &gt; firstly deducted by me out of the total amount<br/>
&gt; &gt; realized from the sold <br/>
&gt; &gt; properties, this was based on the initial agreement<br/>
&gt; &gt; between me and the<br/>
&gt; &gt; owner of the properties before his death. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Therefore,the total amount left to be invested into<br/>
&gt; &gt; God's work as <br/>
&gt; &gt; instructed by the owner is $20,000,000.00 (twenty<br/>
&gt; &gt; million US dollars) <br/>
&gt; &gt; only. But Instead of giving the main fund out for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; work of God as <br/>
&gt; &gt; instructed to me by my client before his death.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I converted the fund to myself with the intention of<br/>
&gt; &gt; investing the fund <br/>
&gt; &gt; abroad for my personal use. I was afraid of putting<br/>
&gt; &gt; the fund in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Bank, because I have to give account to the bank on<br/>
&gt; &gt; how got the money. <br/>
&gt; &gt; I then packaged the fund in consignments and deposited<br/>
&gt; &gt; the consignments <br/>
&gt; &gt; with a security company. I did not want the management<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the Security <br/>
&gt; &gt; Company to know the content of the consignments,<br/>
&gt; &gt; therefore I registered <br/>
&gt; &gt; the content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; security company <br/>
&gt; &gt; believes that what I deposited with them was Gold<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bars. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I had encounter with Christ when Pastor Benny Hinn was<br/>
&gt; &gt; preaching on <br/>
&gt; &gt; television concerning Ananias and Saphira in Acts<br/>
&gt; &gt; 5:1-11. After hearing <br/>
&gt; &gt; the word of God, I gave my life to Christ and became a<br/>
&gt; &gt; born again <br/>
&gt; &gt; Christian.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As a born again Christian, I started reading my bible<br/>
&gt; &gt; and one day, the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Lord opened my eyes to Ezekiel 33: 18 and 19. From the<br/>
&gt; &gt; scripture, I <br/>
&gt; &gt; discovered that the only way I could have peace in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; life is to do <br/>
&gt; &gt; what is lawful and right by giving out the fund as<br/>
&gt; &gt; instructed for the <br/>
&gt; &gt; work of God by my client.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have asked God for forgiveness on my initial thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; concerning the <br/>
&gt; &gt; money,and I know that God have forgiven me. But I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to do what is <br/>
&gt; &gt; lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the<br/>
&gt; &gt; fund to the <br/>
&gt; &gt; chosen ministry for the purpose of God's work as<br/>
&gt; &gt; instructed by my <br/>
&gt; &gt; client before his death.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; After my fasting and prayers, I asked God to make his<br/>
&gt; &gt; choice and direct <br/>
&gt; &gt; me to a honest Christian or the chosen ministry that<br/>
&gt; &gt; deserves this fund <br/>
&gt; &gt; by his Grace.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I then came across your address on the Internet as I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was browsing <br/>
&gt; &gt; through a Christian site, and as a matter of fact, it<br/>
&gt; &gt; is not only you <br/>
&gt; &gt; or your ministry that I picked on the Christian site<br/>
&gt; &gt; initially, but <br/>
&gt; &gt; after my fervent prayer over it, then you were<br/>
&gt; &gt; nominated through divine <br/>
&gt; &gt; revelation from God, so that was  how I received such<br/>
&gt; &gt; a divine <br/>
&gt; &gt; revelation from the Lord, how I got your contact<br/>
&gt; &gt; information, and I <br/>
&gt; &gt; then decided to contact you for the fund to be used<br/>
&gt; &gt; wisely for things <br/>
&gt; &gt; that will glorify the name of God.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have notified the Security Company where I deposited<br/>
&gt; &gt; the consignments <br/>
&gt; &gt; that contained the fund, that I am moving the<br/>
&gt; &gt; consignment abroad and <br/>
&gt; &gt; the security company has since been waiting for my<br/>
&gt; &gt; authority for the <br/>
&gt; &gt; consignment to leave my country and be moved abroad.<br/>
&gt; &gt; So if you know <br/>
&gt; &gt; that you will use this fund honestly and wisely for<br/>
&gt; &gt; things that will <br/>
&gt; &gt; glorify God's name,then do contact me back,ASAP.Then<br/>
&gt; &gt; you send to me in <br/>
&gt; &gt; your reply,YOUR FULL NAMES,YOUR PERSONAL ADDRESS,YOUR<br/>
&gt; &gt; TELEPHONE AND FAX <br/>
&gt; &gt; NUMBERS.These informations are required by the seurity<br/>
&gt; &gt; company to<br/>
&gt; &gt; facilitate the  process  of the funds receiver's<br/>
&gt; &gt; documentation<br/>
&gt; &gt; Your prompt response will be highly appreciated in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; private email <br/>
&gt; &gt; adress(mrmikeade@n...) <br/>
&gt; &gt; God bless you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yours in Christ.<br/>
