I'll let you do that yourself. You should be able to get onto AQ if<br/>
you use the IP address directly at http://74.200.76.117/<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to type it *exactly* like that, including that last slash.<br/>
<br/>
That should work (for the most part) until the domain name starts<br/>
working again.<br/>

You can safely ignore that problem. The security certificate I<br/>
installed was for "www.atlasquest.com", not "74.200.76.117", which is<br/>
why you're getting the warning. Until I get the domain name working<br/>
again, though, I'm not going to worry about the security certificate.<br/>
Just know that it's not another site trying to impersonate AQ, and<br/>
click "okay" or whatever it is to skip the message.<br/>
