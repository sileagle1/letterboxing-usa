                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, thank you. I do enjoy web page building. In fact, I started doing it <br/>
for money from home in the last year. Before, I updated a computer <br/>
company's online store until they shut down the offices here.<br/>
<br/>
I think Mirkwood has a great site too. (P.S. Sorry about your box loss! <br/>
Maybe it'll survive and someone will find it and get it back to you! <br/>
Wouldn't that be neat? By the way, we plan to find some of your boxes when <br/>
we visit later this year. My parents live in Bloomfield.)<br/>

&gt;I absolutely LOVE your page!!!  Nice colors, layout, content, and<br/>
