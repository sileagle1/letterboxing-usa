<br/>
I turned in the Jeep Cherokee at Spokane International Airport and flew out to destination home. I have been gone 622 days or, if you would rather, almost 2 years. I have traveled this country coast to coast and have discovered that letterboxing is alive and thriving. However, the game is not without its perils. There are "rules;" rules to survival. If you want a letterbox to survive, follow the rules. If you don't, well then, do your own thing. The rules are simple: sturdy containers, well-concealed hiding places, maintenance, and stealth. <br/>
<br/>
With the increase of members to the hobby, unfortunately the lives of letterboxes are endangered. Why is this? The answer lies in each state and the uniqueness of its individuals. It is the responsibility of each newbie to learn the unspoken "rules;" it is the responsibility of each "silver back" to teach the unspoken "rules." Flame away, if you wish; it is nothing more than my own observation. <br/>
<br/>
With letterboxing comes hiking. Even with a driveby, you still have to get out of your car. There are a few essentials to hiking. Safety should always come first, that of the letterboxes and your own personal safety, of course. <br/>
<br/>
There are 12 essentials that every hiker should have in their backpack:<br/>
1.	map of the area<br/>
2.	compass<br/>
3.	matches or a fire starter<br/>
4.	knife<br/>
5.	flashlight<br/>
6.	first aid kit<br/>
7.	sunglasses<br/>
8.	extra water and food<br/>
9.	sun protection<br/>
10.	extra clothing<br/>
11.	extra batteries<br/>
12.	whistle<br/>
<br/>
Depending on your location and time of the year, you could also need insect repellent, a small hand shovel, rain poncho, and toilet paper. A casual letterboxer might or might not need all of these items. And don't forget your camera. <br/>
<br/>
Know your environment and your limitations. Dress appropriately for the trails. Good hiking boots or hiking shoes will save an ankle. Know what to do in case of injury; most communities have first aid classes. Know the dangers of the area you are hiking in and be prepared for them. It is never a good idea to just put your hand in a dark hole or stonewall. Always let someone know where you will be and about what time to expect you back. Respect nature; don't expect it to respect you. <br/>
<br/>

That's the absolute truth - those little packets go out of date, but a<br/>
