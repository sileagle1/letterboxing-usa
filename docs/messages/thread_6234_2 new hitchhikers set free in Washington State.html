                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just for the record, hitchhiker 'series' don't really seem like a <br/>
great idea, because it's virtually impossible to "collect them all" <br/>
without checking every letterbox on the face of the planet within a <br/>
24 hour period.  Right now they might all be in the Seattle area, but <br/>
over time they'll start to spread out farther and farther.<br/>
<br/>
Someone placed a 'LOVE' hitchhiker series that drives me crazy.  They <br/>
were of stamps--one for each letter--that when you got them all would <br/>
spell LOVE.  When I discovered the first one in Olympia, I was <br/>
hellbent on checking as many boxes as possible within 200 miles for <br/>
the rest so I'd have a complete series.  Alas, I only found the O, V, <br/>
and E, and I have a stupid little series that now reads OVE.  It's <br/>
frustrating!  At least you didn't create letters where a word is <br/>
spelled out and is impossible to complete without finding all of the <br/>
stamps in the series, but it's frustrating to look for a series and <br/>
never be able to finish it through no fault of your own.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, there's so many freaking hitchhikers in the Pacific Northwest <br/>
nowdays, they really don't hold the charm they once did.  *shrug*  <br/>
Just my opinion.  I like being able to go back and see what people <br/>
write in the boxes I've placed too, which with hitchhikers isn't <br/>
possible once they leave the area.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts!<br/>

If you don't like hitchhikers, just leave them for the next person. No reason to get all huffy about it. LOL. (:  I think they're fun, especially if they have been all over the country. My husband and I enjoy looking at all the different stamps. <br/>

Oh, don't get me wrong...  I DO like hitchhikers.  But when I start <br/>
finding them in about every other box, they kind of lose their <br/>
thrill.  I've hid a few hitchhikers myself, but that was when I <br/>
didn't know of any that existed in the Pacific Northwest and had yet <br/>
to ever find one.  On my last great 'hunt' through the Seattle area, <br/>
I found five hitchhikers in less than a week.  (I think it was five.  <br/>
That's how many I remember off the top of my head!)  The first one <br/>
was rather exciting to find.  By the fifth one, it was like, 'What, <br/>
ANOTHER one?!'  It gets old.  *shrug*  Hitchhikers are only good in <br/>
moderation.  =)<br/>
