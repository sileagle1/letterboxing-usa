                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello team!  I've contacted the Adopt-a-Roadway coordinator and <br/>
found answers to all of our questions<br/>
<br/>
As suspected, our little piece of road was rather neglected.  She <br/>
said it hadn't been adopted for many years, but they had been <br/>
sending a group of teen volunteers out there once each summer.  <br/>
Needless to say, they probably didn't invest as much time and energy <br/>
as we did!  She stressed that we did a great job and should be proud <br/>
of ourselves.  Of course, every little bit we do saves the county <br/>
time and money  (and that should be our goal, rather than perfect <br/>
spotlessness.)  I've told some of you that when I went to drop the <br/>
vests off, there was another group picking up theirs They have 2.75 <br/>
miles, 15 people in their group, and they only needed one bag <br/>
apiece!!  There were only SIX of us and we used 37 bags for ONE side <br/>
of ONE mile!!  We all deserve a big pat on the back and a good long <br/>
massage, I think!<br/>
<br/>
While I was at it, I picked Thursday, May 26th for finishing up the <br/>
north side of the road.   How about we meet for breakfast and the <br/>
safety briefing at the Jerry Bob's on Valencia and Tucson Blvd at 6 <br/>
am?  (It's right next to the Denny's from last time.)<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to hear everyone's suggestions on how to make it go <br/>
easier.  Ron thinks maybe we should split up into 3 groups and each <br/>
take a 1/3 of a mile.  That would make it seem very manageable, and <br/>
you could spend as much time as you can on your section before you <br/>
need to go.  If there were 8 of us this time, a quarter mile would <br/>
seem like a breeze!  Let's all try to think of friends we could <br/>
bring along this go around!!    <br/>
<br/>
As last time, ADOT is providing the trash bags and safety vests.  <br/>
Ron and I bought the picker-upper tongs and a case of water.  You <br/>
will need:  sunscreen and hat, tennies or boots, long sleeves and <br/>
pants, and leather work gloves.   Oh yeah, and that friend!  <br/>
<br/>
Please RSVP to me ASAP at kdmoreland@cox.net so we know how many <br/>
safety vests to get.  Thanks again to everyone!  Hope to hear from <br/>
you soon!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What an awesome idea!!!  Congratulations!  I used to travel along <br/>
that stretch of road quite a bit--many years ago when I lived out <br/>
that way.  Way to go!!!  Makes me wonder if we could get something <br/>
like this started in our current location...<br/>
