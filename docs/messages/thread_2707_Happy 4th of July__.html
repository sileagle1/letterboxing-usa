down to Laurel, Maryland from Hellertown, PA. on the 5th to visit family. <br/>
Where we will be staying there till Sunday.<br/>
We have a trip planned Friday, to DC via the Metro, to visit around the <br/>
Smithsonian Museums.<br/>
Then we might go to Great Falls on Sat.(I grew up around the Beltway and <br/>
want to show my son the "cool" spots!)<br/>
Any ideas about 'boxing in the area?<br/>
My sister and her son have never been, we are P3F50X34E1 at present.<br/>
I've put a stamp kit together for their use and would like to to be able to <br/>
stamp into several boxes with them. My hope is they will be touched by the <br/>
magic..and want to join the fun on a regular basis.<br/>
We have previuosly stamped into Wheaton Regional Park, Lake Frank, and Lake <br/>
Needwood.<br/>
Thanks for any ideas, in advance!!<br/>
Have a great 4th!!!    See Joy       see_joy29@hotmail.com<br/>
