But fortunately for me I wasn't carrying a child, how scary for you. I did have my GPS unit with me BUT I didn't have my cell phone. I had my dog with me so maybe I would try a "Lassie, go get help" plea if I was in serious trouble. <br/>
<br/>
I live in Canada and use Garmin Mapsource software with my GPS V. I get main roads and most country roads but not all country roads in my area. And unfortunately it doesn't include trails (that would be a fantastic feature). I don't know if U.S. software is more detailed. <br/>
<br/>
If your cell phone works on the trail and you have a GPS unit I would think that would be a bonus for the rescuers, assuming they use GPS software to locate people - one would hope so. <br/>

I know that you can buy ones set for hiking, and I believe they carry trail<br/>
maps, but I have no idea how good these are.....thus my questions.  :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I often hike alone and these are a few of the precautionary measures I take...<br/>
<br/>
1) I often do carry a GPS and have along a cell phone.  Whether I remember to turn on the GPS before I get too deep into the woods is another story...  as is the quality of cell phone reception, but they may help if need be, so I carry them.<br/>
<br/>
2) Probably the most important thing I do when I am going alone...  I either print or e-mail a list of the places and letterboxes I am going to look for to OldShoe.  Then when I am out and about I periodically call home and leave messages on the machine as to where I am on my itinerary.  This way, if I do get stranded out in the woods and have no way to call for help, there will be a record of stops I was planning as well as the last place I was okay.  It is important to give the box names, not just the park because in a park with 20 miles of trail, it could take a while to narrow down your location if the search &amp; rescue party did not have the box clues.<br/>

  I just came in from a lovely hike while out on a hunt. It rained last<br/>
  night and some of the rocks were quite slick. I took an impressive fall on<br/>
  a slick rock while wearing a toddler in a back pack. We're both fine, but<br/>
  it really got me to thinking.. If either of us had been hurt, and I needed<br/>
  to tell "911" where I was, ...um, where am I?? I didn't have a trail<br/>
  map, and apparently made my way from one town to another, and was on a very<br/>
  distinct trail..but I don't know exactly where I was and what might be the<br/>
  easiest way "in" for rescuers.<br/>
<br/>
  Thus my questions:<br/>
<br/>
  a) Do you carry a GPS unit with you while you hike?<br/>
<br/>
  b) Do you find trails on "hiking" GPS units to be well-detailed?<br/>
<br/>
  c) Do the trail maps in GPS units tend to follow only the official<br/>

I do try to carry a good map when in unfamiliar locations ( you can print<br/>
them out online)  and to tell someone where I am going and when I should be<br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>
Most modern cell phones are equipped to give 911 a GPS position.. However,<br/>
cell phones rarely work far from the road - around here they rarely work<br/>
except in or very near larger towns.<br/>
