Mary From Virginia: Finally  went looking for your Oak Marr box in <br/>
your series: Very nicely done! The baggie you had it wrapped in <br/>
was pretty soggy, so I took the liberty of replacing it with a <br/>
somewhat sturdier type. The box itself was completely dry inside <br/>
and the logbook and stamp were fine. Good job.<br/>

You could tell what it was?!  YEAH!  Glad you found it and liked the park.  <br/>
There are so many little neighborhood hide-aways around this area!  BeMa<br/>
