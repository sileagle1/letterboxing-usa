too many of Ryan's stamps, but if the Eye a half star, the rest must <br/>
be spectacular<br/>

&gt; Thanks for the support, Amanda.  Sorry for the confusion, but yes, <br/>
&gt; all of the stamps are of my OWN creation that I've hidden myself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for the ugly eyeball hitchhiker I created, did you notice it's <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; ONLY stamp to get just a half star?  That's on a scale of 1 to 3 <br/>
&gt; stars!  =)  I'm not ashamed to admit I'm not proud of all my work, <br/>
&gt; but it doesn't stop me from hiding them.  However, I thought people <br/>
&gt; would like to know the quality of the stamp to expect.  Or at least <br/>
&gt; my opinion of them.  They are just one man's opinions, though, so <br/>
&gt; take the rankings with a grain of salt.<br/>

&gt; Happy trails!<br/>
