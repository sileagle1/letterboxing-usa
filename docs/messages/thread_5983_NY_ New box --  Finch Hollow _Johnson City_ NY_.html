                    <div class="plaintext-content">This week, Silent Doug &amp; TurtleMcQ placed the Finch Hollow letterbox in <br/>
Johnson City, NY (just outside of Binghamton, not far from Endicott).  The <br/>
clue resides here:<br/>
http://www.douglasgerlach.com/letterboxing/box_finchhollow.html<br/>
<br/>
Finch Hollow<br/>
Location: Johnson City, NY (Broome County)<br/>
Placed by: Silent Doug and TurtleMcQ<br/>
Date Placed: July 2, 2002<br/>
Terrain: Easy<br/>
Difficulty: Easy<br/>
Time: 45 minutes<br/>
<br/>
The Finch Hollow Nature Center is located at 1394 Oakdale Road in Johnson <br/>
City, New York. The Center consists of a display of 300 mounted birds and <br/>
animals in a renovated two-room schoolhouse, regularly-presented <br/>
educational programs, and an interpretive one-mile-long nature trail loop. <br/>
(There's also a beginner's compass course if you want to bring your basic <br/>
orienteering skills up to speed!) Dogs on leash are allowed on the paths, <br/>
and there are picnic tables in the museum's backyard. The trail is open <br/>
daily from sunrise to sunset; if the museum is open, you can walk straight <br/>
through the building (and say hello to the nice folks inside) and out the <br/>
back door to reach the trail; otherwise just walk around the building. <br/>
Trail maps are available in the Center, which are helpful but not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
In order these box clues to unravel<br/>
Down the hill to the trail you must travel.<br/>
Now, as you hike, heed all signposts you see<br/>
Beside the path, for their numbers are key.<br/>
<br/>
First, follow the path's left fork at the field.<br/>
Aim for the straightest, well-mowed course you can see,<br/>
You're now in the home of mouse, fox and rabbit,<br/>
Who find cover in this wild habitat.<br/>
The path forks to the left; don't you follow!<br/>
But note the birdhouses built for swallows;<br/>
Eastern bluebirds also pass by this way.<br/>
Mark the second step of your trek today.<br/>
<br/>
A dead white pine tree can be filled with life.<br/>
Did you know this third fact? How wildlife can thrive?<br/>
Bugs burrow, become a woodpecker's meal.<br/>
Raccoons snooze days away, snug and concealed,<br/>
A hawk eyes the field from his lofty perch.<br/>
Head straight now on the path, do not diverge,<br/>
Turning not to the forked trail to the left,<br/>
Walk past the tables, there's no need to rest.<br/>
<br/>
Look now to the red pines not so distant<br/>
More than four; you'll be there in an instant.<br/>
The pines' small round cones are easy to spy,<br/>
But leave them - they may sprout saplings in time.<br/>
<br/>
Turn left now (not right), then stay straightaway.<br/>
You're now in wetlands, fifth in your journey,<br/>
Cattails and willows reveal water near;<br/>
Is the path muddy? Do feet disappear?<br/>
<br/>
Don't tarry too long, turn right towards the stream,<br/>
And cross it. How? However best you deem!<br/>
In Spring, you might swim-water six feet high!<br/>
If not, step over, or the bed might be dry.<br/>
<br/>
After navigating the stream, turn right,<br/>
And pass by the shrubs with berries of white<br/>
(In summer, that is). Multiflora rose<br/>
Is this plant's name, a noxious weed that grows,<br/>
Sometimes forms thickets that cannot be passed,<br/>
A plant that's a nuisance and so very crass.<br/>
<br/>
So ends your seventh lesson of the day,<br/>
Cross a bridge, into the woods you'll foray.<br/>
 From field to wetlands to woodlands you've toured,<br/>
Now there's shade, shelter and trees to explore.<br/>
<br/>
Pass through this eighth stage to another bridge.<br/>
Cross it - then stop! For your prize is not far.<br/>
Look to your left to the dead, fallen tree,<br/>
In the crook of a limb you'll find what you seek.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the path and this grove you'll depart,<br/>
The path curves left past a bench; rest if you ought.<br/>
Then across an earthen dam you'll traverse,<br/>
A tenth lovely site near the end of this verse.<br/>
<br/>
A look ahead reveals the main building;<br/>
Which you'll reach when you're done with your climbing,<br/>
Today's quest successfully completed.<br/>
But wait - was a number deleted?<br/>
It's true, shrewd observer, nine's been omitted.<br/>
To see its secrets, you'll have to revisit!<br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
1) The path crosses a stream that may be completely dry, or may require <br/>
that you step across on flat stones. In periods of heavy rain, such as its <br/>
regular spring floods, this stream could even be several feet high! If the <br/>
path is unpassable, you may need to use some ingenuity to reach the right <br/>
location on this loop trail.<br/>
2) Watch out for poison ivy (it was very light in the area near the box at <br/>
the time it was hidden) and crawly creatures.<br/>
3) The box location is quite obvious from the path. You should probably <br/>
find the nearby bench and sit there to take care of your business.<br/>
4) Replace the box carefully in its hiding place after you've stamped in.<br/>
