  the real question is:<br/>
  why would you wanna play with yourself, <br/>
  hiding in your room, with the expectation for people to find you there?<br/>
<br/>
  what if you end up playing with yourself because no one looks for you?<br/>
<br/>
  what about showing everyone how to play with each other?<br/>
<br/>
  i perfer playing with others.    ;)    it's more fun that way!<br/>

  2) nope, just a stamp<br/>

  4) technically not, I'd come back when the stamp was replaced<br/>
  5) maybe in New England, the only thing I've ever found without clues is geocaches....<br/>

  Lotta fun.  My kids do these quizzes all the time, but mostly they're about "have you ever smoked/kissed someone/played hooky...."  It's about time someone wrote one for ME!  =)<br/>
