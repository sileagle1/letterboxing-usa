                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was so gorgeous today that I was forced to neglect my work and hit the trails on Sauvie Island. I <br/>
checked on the Hidden Dragon and Sturgeon Lake boxes while I was there. Both have had one visitor. The <br/>
Hidden Dragon has defied discovery by any letterboxers so far but a kindly Metro Parks worker stumbled <br/>
upon it and was cool enough to write a note and put it back. The grass that was ankle high when I placed <br/>
the  Sturgeon Lake box is now  up to my shoulders along the trail. One of the landmarks in the clue was <br/>
totally invisible so I did my best to expose it once again. This is such a wonderful spot, an easy flat trail <br/>
and filled with birdsong that I'm surprised more people haven't gone for the box. Funhog<br/>
