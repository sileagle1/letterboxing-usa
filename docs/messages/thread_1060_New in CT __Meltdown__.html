Jay<br/>
<br/>
Meltdown<br/>
<br/>
A single letterbox on a very easy  mile ocean side nature trail<br/>
next <br/>
to one of the world's most dysfunctional industrial sites. <br/>
Directions: on CT Rte. 154 in Waterford, just east of the Niantic <br/>
River Bridge, turn into the Millstone Nuclear Power Plant access <br/>
road. After 0.9 miles, park on the left in the nature trail parking <br/>
area. Bring a book, picnic blanket, and your grandkids. No compasses <br/>
or Geiger Counters are needed today.<br/>
<br/>
Radioactivity: Continue a short bit down the road on foot and turn <br/>
left into the well-marked nature trail. Fork left near the osprey <br/>
observation blind for a clockwise loop. After "6," go straight across <br/>
at the intersection, and after "9," bear left to enjoy the sandy <br/>
beach at Jordon Cove. Returning from the beach, turn left on the old <br/>
road towards the power plant cooling towers and walk with Long Island <br/>
Sound on your left. Pass through a gate and find the "LI Sound <br/>
Overlook" on the left at "11." Enjoy the terrific views from the <br/>
large bench, and notice a stone wall in disrepair behind you. Your <br/>
reward waits on the far side. After stamping in, head on home. In the <br/>
brief Osprey nesting season the loop is closed: zig zag right-left <br/>
across the road to regain the trail. The rest of the year, simply <br/>
turn left at the road, pass the sea eagle's nest, and then cut right <br/>
behind the small clapboard church to finish the circle.<br/>
