<div>I'm glad I had an excuse to go out to Ellis Island 
and the Statue of Liberty.  I didn't get the letterbox, but I enjoyed the 
visit.  I arrived just after 9 am for the first ferry and decided to make a 
stop at Ellis Island.  Searching for the letterbox was only a small part of 
my itinerary for the day and it was a perfect connection to my other 
plans.  You see, after I finished at Liberty State Park, I headed for a 
family reunion up in Bergen County.  This was the 31st year of the reunion 
of the descendants of Aniello Matarazzo, my great grandfather, who spent 19 days 
quarantined at Ellis in the early part of the 20th century.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At the 15th reunion in 1985, one of my relatives 
submitted our group photo to the museum at Ellis Island and it was really neat 
to be able to go over to a kiosk and key in the name to see the picture.  I 
got a lot of good pictures while walking around.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Next I headed for the Statue.  One of my 
chance meetings the prior day was the placer of the box there and she said that 
I might not have to go to the top.  Thank goodness for that!  I'd 
still be on line now.  The day was perfect and the island was packed.  
I had hoped the clues would make sense once I got there.  That wasn't the 
case.  Part of the problem was that I was in a hurry to get to the family 
reunion didn't have time to really concentrate.  I'm going to definately 
plan to make a day of it next time.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Like I said, the place was crowded and there were a 
lot of rangers and security officers standing around.  I got an 
uncomfortable feeling that some of them were glancing over at me as I walked 
around.  I began to wonder what I looked like pacing around and looking 
into bushes with my black camera bag and that gosh-darn black handgun-sized 
letterboxing pouch.  I finally decided to cut ofthe search and move 
on.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oh well better luck next time.</div>

<div>Later,</div>
