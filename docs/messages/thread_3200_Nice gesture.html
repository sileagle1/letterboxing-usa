<br/>
And it is nicer yet when the state or province is the FIRST THING on the <br/>
subject line, cuz sometimes those subject lines get long and the email <br/>
program shows only the first part and then trails off with <br/>
these......................................................... and we still <br/>
have to open the message to see if it's about a letterbox location we are <br/>
interested in.  (I should say, "in which we are interested," but I think <br/>
that sounds odd, even if it is correct :)<br/>

Thank you, Glenn!<br/>

reminding everyone how nice it would be to mention the state or <br/>
province in the subjuct line, and it make sure it's the first thing <br/>
in the subject line.  I think we should designate someone to post <br/>
such a warning once a month (this month is already done!) and heckle <br/>
anyone who posts such a warning more often than that.  The warning is <br/>
meant to save everyone time and trouble, but it doesn't when everyone <br/>
has to keep reading the warning all of the time!<br/>

Lucy, you can say it just as you did!  After all, Shakespeare had <br/>
