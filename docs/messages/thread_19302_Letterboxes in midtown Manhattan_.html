Greetings, folks!  I'll be in midtown Manhattan next month and was wondering if there're any boxes around, just south of or in the southern part of Central Park (50th to 86th street)?  I only see clues for two on LbNa - one much further south of the island (1st street) and the other further north.  Happy hunting!  Fern Sprite in the Old Dominion<br/>

I heard about this story from a "mutual friend" and still don't understand why the FBI followed your trail. Were you the last letterboxer stamped into the logbook? I would think they would have traced the box to the placer but maybe the FBI didn't want to take a trip that far north!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - thanks for taking one for the team!! I'm sure you were an admirable opponent!<br/>

Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! [And avoid the FBI at all costs!]<br/>

So cool!  I'll check the clues list before I head to Manhattan. By the by, I'm coming from Richmond, VA, but my sister whom I'm meeting is from LA - Van Nuys area.  Great place to visit.<br/>

Greetings, folks!  I'll be in midtown Manhattan next month and was wondering if there're any boxes around, just south of or in the southern part of Central Park (50th to 86th street)?  I only see clues for two on LbNa - one much further south of the island (1st street) and the other further north.  Happy hunting!  Fern Sprite in the Old Dominion<br/>
