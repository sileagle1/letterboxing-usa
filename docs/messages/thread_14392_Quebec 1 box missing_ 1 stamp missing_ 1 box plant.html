<br/>
We traveled up to quebec city last week and did some mobile box work.<br/>
<br/>
We found 1 box missing, 1 was found, but missing a stamp, and we planted one.<br/>
<br/>
Poutine: found safe and sound on the planes of abraham, but was missing the <br/>
stamp.   We stamped in the book, and left a note about the stamp being <br/>
missing.<br/>
<br/>
The Pink Bullet: seems to be missing, we found the right area, and even looked <br/>
in the cannon w/ a flash light and it seems to be gone.<br/>
<br/>
The newly planted box is called stairway w/ a view, and needs translation to <br/>
french.   Any one willing to help w/ this would be great!<br/>
<br/>

This is an urban micro box, in a tourist and residential area, please be <br/>
stealthy. <br/>
<br/>
Go to the Chateua De Frontenac and start walking south along the boardwalk. <br/>
Walkdown to the Dufferin Gazebo and enjoy the view of the mightly river for a <br/>
bit. Behind you is a ramp leading north toward a street (Terrasse - <br/>
Dufferin). Walk up the ramp and make a left down what looks like an alley. <br/>
Walk down the alley (cul de sac) untill you see a set of stairs (escale de la <br/>
terrasse) leading up to a park. Before you go up the stairs, look under the <br/>
first cement step, behind a rock, and youll find your prize.<br/>
