I am new to letterboxing in Indiana.  My first attempt at the hunt <br/>
was the D'Ville box on Columbus Day.  I believe it is missing.  I <br/>
retraced my steps to be sure my bearings were accurate and ended up <br/>
at the same spot...but found nothing.  I could see where it must've<br/>
been hidden.  Have you tried contacting the hider?<br/>
<br/>
I'll be trying for the other IN letterboxes soon and also have plans <br/>
to hide some as well.  We have alot of catching up to do to compete <br/>
with OH.  Don't know of any IN groups.<br/>

Hello, Just wanted to answer the recent questions about my D'ville <br/>
letterbox. First of all, yes it is still there. I verifed it on 11-02-<br/>
02. I also added an update to my original posting due to the fact <br/>
that there were some bad storms this year and it may have effected <br/>
the original clues. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone in Indiana does find or start a group here please let me <br/>
know. We need to get more people interested here, considering we only <br/>
have  6 letterboxes in the whole state!<br/>
<br/>
thanks Mark<br/>
