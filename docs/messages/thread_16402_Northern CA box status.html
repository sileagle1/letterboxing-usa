                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, it hasn't been a good week for my poor letterboxes!  I have received reports that <br/>
several of them are missing - and I was on such a streak there for a while.  Here's <br/>
what I've heard:<br/>
<br/>
Every Flavor Beans in Fairfield could not be located - have not been up there to <br/>
confirm, which actually will be somewhat hard to do since A-Bear moved it for me <br/>
from its original spot and I'm not positive I know where to check!<br/>
<br/>
Skywalker Ranch near Lagunitas in Marin County - all 3 reported missing!  This was <br/>
one of the first series I ever planted and I have never had a chance to check them <br/>
since they are so far from my home.  They are hidden in a state park, and it says so in <br/>
the clues.  Has anyone else had any problems with California state parks?  Maybe <br/>
some ranger pulled them all....  I will try to get to Marin sometime this month to <br/>
confirm that they are gone (including my Princess Leia stamp - boo hoo)<br/>
<br/>
Beach Grover in Grover Beach - confirmed by Sir Balthazar.  Lived only 8 days!<br/>
<br/>
Well, they say bad things come in threes, so I am hoping that this will end the rash of <br/>
missing letterboxes for me.  Naturally none of these boxes is near my home. Good <br/>
news is that I'm headed for Tuolumne County this weekend and will be planting out <br/>
there.<br/>
