                    <div class="plaintext-content">This past Monday myself and three of the six SEAL pups<br/>
checked out the Mariners Museum Park boxes in Newport<br/>
News, VA.  If you have not checked these four boxes<br/>
out you should give them some consideration.  It is a<br/>
five mile walk with the boxes strung out the distance<br/>
of the trail.  The trail meanders through some<br/>
beautiful scenery and the Cardweaver's stamps are<br/>
great.  The boxes were in excellent shape and in<br/>
place, except for box #2 (I think) the container had<br/>
some cracks in the bottom of it.  Everything inside<br/>
was dry thanks to baggies.  Don't know how long that<br/>
will last though.  The pups and I were a little tired<br/>
at he end.  We ended up at the Mariner's Museum and<br/>
had a welcomed picnic lunch.  The Mariner's Museum is<br/>
another reason to give these boxes your attention.  A<br/>
significant piece of history recently arrived there. <br/>
Box #4 gives you a hint to this piece of history.<br/>
<br/>
Take water with you.  We highly recommend this trip.<br/>
