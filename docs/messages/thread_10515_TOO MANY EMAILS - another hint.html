                    <div class="plaintext-content">A very good way to deal is to make a separate folder in your email <br/>
box just for Letterboxing.  Then make a rule that all email with <br/>
subjects containing "LBNA" be automatically moved there.  Look <br/>
under "ools, Message Rules, Mail" in Outlook Express.<br/>
<br/>
Then it doesn't clog your personal mail.  In the Letterboxing folder <br/>
you can delete all of it at once if you want to because it's only <br/>
LBNA and not your personal stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The one precaution is that if someone sends you "personal" mail with <br/>
LBNA in the subject it will go to the new folder too.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

&gt; CLICK on the "EDIT MY MEMBERSHIP" link toward the top right of the <br/>
&gt; letterbox group page and scroll down to the "MESSAGE DELIVERY" <br/>
&gt; section, choose the last option "NO EMAIL-- I'll view the messages <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; the list".  That should eliminate the problem---the messages don't <br/>
go <br/>
