<br/>
Shasta Lake (5 miles North of Redding)<br/>
Shasta County<br/>
California<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Take I-5 to Shasta Dam Blvd, then head West for 5 miles <br/>
to paved turnout/overlook with an incredible view of the dam.  Don't <br/>
go down to the one adjacent the visitors center.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  This is a micro-letterbox (35 mm film canister).  Bring pen &amp; <br/>
stamp pad.  Also, bring green, brown, grey and blue markers for added <br/>
stamping effect.<br/>
<br/>
History:  Authorized in 1935, this dam serves as the keystone of the <br/>
Central Valley Project providing much needed water to areas in <br/>
Southern California and helping to better control damaging floods of <br/>
the Sacramento River Valley which often occured prior to the dam's <br/>
construction.  It is one of the largest dams in the world and forms <br/>
the largest storage reservoir in CA.  The 602' concrete structure <br/>
reinforced with giant copper rods receives runoff from the Pit, <br/>
McCloud and Sacramento Rivers.  This dam is higher than the <br/>
Washington Monument and its spillway is 3 times the height of Niagara <br/>
Falls.  It was built with enough concrete to build a sidewalk 3' <br/>
wide, 4" thick around the Earth's equator!!!  When the 35 mile long <br/>
reservoir is full, it contains enough water to cover the state of <br/>
Connecticut to a depth of 1.5 feet.  What would they do with 800+ <br/>
floating letterboxes in CT?  :)  Better anchor 'em down!  Info <br/>
respectfully gleaned from Mar 1999 Shasta &amp; Keswick Dams Fact Sheet <br/>
from the US Government.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  From the 4' rusted metal pole mid-turn out facing the dam, <br/>
head 150 past 39 concrete 'bricks' to a steel guardian.  Dammed <br/>
Shasta is carefully plugged up within.  Please rehide well.<br/>

This letterbox is an orphan.  Please email me at blee@pobox.com when <br/>
you find it.<br/>
