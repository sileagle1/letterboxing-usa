is a FAQ on the website which should answer all of you questions.  But to<br/>

<br/>
A few suggestions, indicate the State, Nearest town, and County when<br/>
providing your clues so that you can save the wonderful webmasters time in<br/>
posting your clues on the state pages.<br/>
<br/>
The clues can be any variety of difficulty, can be with or without compass<br/>
headings if you wish.  Make sure to pick up a stamp for your family or<br/>
pick one out for each individual.  And if you are a handy artist you can<br/>
even get a carving kit from speedball and carve erasers or other material.<br/>

In any event just listen to the discussion here and you will pick up the<br/>

<div>Hi Wendy,  We have only been letterboxing a 
few months, but like you think it is great.  I'm sure your kids will enjoy 
it too.  Check out the Letterbox site for very helpful hints to get 
started.  There are folks in the east and along the northern</div>
<div>Pacific Coast who have been letterboxing for a 
long time..  There are great tips</div>
<div>in the archive section of the L/B site.  Locally in So. Cal, check out 
our Box in Signal Hill (easy).  The next closest box would be in Palos 
Verdes at the head of Crenshaw Blvd.  There is some mystery associated with 
this one,(placed by Wendy Gault)  We have visited it twice and need to go 
for a third time to solve the secondary puzzle.  The boxes can be very 
simple with a home made or purchased stamp and a small  notebook 
wrapped in a couple of sealed baggies and then placed inside a waterproof 
container.  Clues and directions are posted to this site.  Sometimes 
there is another stamp in the container that you can take with you after 
stamping it in your book and place it in your next visited box.  This stamp 
is called a hitchhiker.  Read about it and other variations on the web 
site.  <span id="__#Ath#SignaturePos__"></span> Was there something 
extra in the Bolsa Chica Box and were you the first to stamp in?  Keep in 
touch.  We need more boxes in So. Cal.  For longer hikes and 
adventures, visit the northern San Diego County box and the ones in 
Ventura/Thousand Oaks area. They are listed on the web site under LA area 
letterboxes, California Central Coast, and Northern San Diego County.  Be 
thinking about places you and the kids can visit and place boxes!  Let 
us know if we can help.  Have fun!  Gwen and Don</div>

    They are listed on the web site under LA area letterboxes, California 
    Central Coast, and Northern San Diego County.  Be thinking about places 
    you and the kids can visit and place boxes!  Let us know if we can 
    help.  Have fun!  Gwen and Don</div>

<div>Hello all.  I stumbled upon the website 
      while looking for links to geocaching.  Took the kids out to find the 
      Bolsa Chica, CA box.  Thanks Gwen and Don!  Great location and 
      just minutes from my home.  The kids loved it and I think they (we) 
      are hooked.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm interested in hiding a few of my own her 
      in So. Cal, but I'm not really sure how to post clues.  Any help 
      would be appreciated.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings All,<br/>
<br/>
I recently came across this exciting web page and have been hooked ever<br/>
since.  My two younger kids and myself have been avidly searching the trails<br/>
in eastern Massachusetts for letterboxes over the past couple of months and<br/>
have found a few as well as some great places for a family hike, which we've<br/>
always been fond of anyway.  The very first letterbox we found was Ponkapoag<br/>
Turtle.  Even though the area was still covered in almost a foot of snow,<br/>
the box was in great shape.  So far we've found every box we've set out for<br/>
with the exception of Hancock Hill.  I don't know if we were at the wrong<br/>
pine tree or if the box has been removed, but we will try again.<br/>
<br/>
We plan to plant our first letterbox in the Moose Hill Audubon Sanctuary in<br/>
the next week or so and will provide clues when we do.  I assume that clues<br/>
are given through this e-mail address?  If not, could someone let me know<br/>
the best way to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we came across the "Moose on the Loose" hitchhiker this past Marathon<br/>
Monday.  It was located with the Two Hearts letterbox in Lincoln.  I'll let<br/>
you when and where it continues on its way.  I believe I saw somewhere in<br/>
the LBNA webpage that you are trying to follow the progress of the<br/>
hitchhikers as they move about the country.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you for some great artistic designs with your stamps and<br/>
some great places to visit.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping that it finally gets warm and stays warm as I look at the snow coming<br/>
down outside my window.<br/>

<br/>
While hiking the Appalachian Trail this summer, I found a letterbox <br/>
at a campsite in Pennslyvania and was intrigued by it. I read all the <br/>
information in the box and knew that this was something I wanted to <br/>
start doing when I got home to Minnesota.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortuately there doesn't seem to be many boxes in Minnesota. Where <br/>
can I find a list for more boxes? Is there just not many people that <br/>
are into Letterboxing in MN?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>

I'm a Minnesota Letterboxer, new to it as of October. I decided I <br/>
wanted to find a few boxes before I placed any. I've found a few in <br/>
Minnesota but, you're right there aren't all that many. I'm busy <br/>
carving for placements in Minnesota come snow melt so look for them <br/>
to be posted soon after. It's good to see others from Minnesota <br/>
taking an interest. I've been trying to spread the word. If you want <br/>
to contact me offline, we could put our heads together about ideas on <br/>
getting more people involved in Minnesota. I'm at deb dot maertens at <br/>

Nope. In fact, most people letterbox on their own or with a friend or<br/>
two. Very rarely do you find letterboxers hunting in groups, though. =)<br/>
<br/>

I have a carving tutorial you can read at<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/tutorials/carving/<br/>
<br/>
You aren't "required" to carve your own stamp, but they are much<br/>
perferred by most people so I'd consider it a recommendation. You<br/>
don't have to rush out and start carving immediately, though. A lot of<br/>
people even use their thumbprint as a "unique stamp" until they get<br/>
around to carving an official signature stamp.<br/>

Hmmm.... There's the Northeast list, though it's morphed mostly into a<br/>
New England list at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbNE/<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if Pennsylvania counts as part of the mid-Atlantic, but you<br/>
might find some fellow Pennsylvanians on that board at<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lbma/<br/>
<br/>
As a newbie, you might also find the New Boxers talk list extermely<br/>
helpful. It's at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
<br/>
Then there's also the message boards on Atlas Quest which has a board<br/>
for every state in the US, though it's not used much for Pennsylvania.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

I am also in the SE Pennsylvania area and we use the LBMA<br/>
(Letterboxing Mid Atlantic) site for our local postings.  You can find<br/>
it at: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lbma/<br/>
<br/>
Where in SE PA might you be?  There are a group of us who often<br/>
letterbox together and since I more often letterbox alone, I would<br/>
welcome some company if you are nearby.  I am in the Reading, Berks<br/>
County, PA area.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">hey lady kristine, welcome to letterboxing..let me help you out a <br/>
little:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 1) Do we have to be affiliated with a group to go find the boxes?<br/>
<br/>
No. you just go out and find boxes!<br/>
<br/>
  Can we stay as a threesome and just enjoy our time privately (at <br/>
least for now)?<br/>
<br/>
yes. you can look for boxes in a group or singly. you don't have to <br/>
go boxing with a formal group. many of us go out on our own or with <br/>
our youngins.<br/>
<br/>
I've met people on the trail that looked for boxes but <br/>
didn't "play" - they didn't post any messages. some don't even <br/>
collect the stamp images. they just stamp in! <br/>
<br/>
so there are very little rules except for being polite to others and <br/>
the environment.  other than that, you do what you want with regards <br/>
to finding boxes. you make your own letterboxing experience.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2) How do we carve our own stamps?  I saw a kit for sale. Are we <br/>
&gt; required to carve our own, or can we use premade ones?  Pros and <br/>
cons of each?<br/>
<br/>
looks at the links folder for a web page on stamp carving. it's <br/>
easier than you think! but you can use premade ones too. my dd's is <br/>
a pooh stamp. i have a stamp that another letterboxer made for me. <br/>
there are no rules for this. it's personal preference.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) Someone mentioned recently that some states have a mailing list <br/>
with localized information. How do I find a list for SE Pennsylvania?<br/>
<br/>
again, look at the links folder for a web page called atlas quest. <br/>
it's a good place to start when looking for specific regional groups.<br/>
<br/>
have fun!<br/>

Welcome to the madness.  You may want to join another group in <br/>
addition to this one, it's especially for new boxers:<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/?yguid=231777731<br/>
<br/>
I, too, am realtively new and am hooked already.  I thought I'd <br/>
address the issue of difficulty -<br/>
<br/>
Some boxes are a piece of cake - the easiest I've ever found took <br/>
less than 100 steps.  Some are difficult - I spent an hour and a <br/>
half walking up and down hills &amp; trying to decipher clues, only to <br/>
find the box missing.  But even that one was fun, as at the end of <br/>
the trail there was a fishing pond, a waterfall and a delightful <br/>
creek.  Others fall in the middle, a long walk, but easy clues.  My <br/>
wife and I found one last weekend that was about a quarter mile <br/>
walk, and easy to find - what was hard was extracting the box from <br/>
the tree trunk and remain concealed as to what we were doing as <br/>
there was a couple just sitting about 100 yards away - we hid behind <br/>
the tree.  And, I've taken a look at some clues and didn't even know <br/>
where to begin.  So, it's up to you - look for ones that you think <br/>
the clues are pretty easy to start with - but beware - always plan <br/>
on walking farther than you think, carry bug spray and water.  See <br/>
my post in the new boxers list about a backpack we carry.<br/>
<br/>
happy boxing,<br/>

new Letterboxers since August started that way! ANybody??<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if any larger publications will pick up on it.<br/>

That shows I'm a newbie! PLEASE ADVISE: Do we want publicity? Do we <br/>
want media coverage? Is it OK for a kid to do a presentation in <br/>
school about it? Press releases in local papers? What's the party <br/>
line here?<br/>

There are pros and cons in either case. To publicize or not? That is <br/>

  We got that issue on a Wed and were out hunting on THurs. We're in <br/>

  new Letterboxers since August started that way! ANybody??<br/>
<br/>
  I wonder if any larger publications will pick up on it.<br/>
<br/>
  That shows I'm a newbie! PLEASE ADVISE: Do we want publicity? Do we <br/>

<br/>
  There are pros and cons in either case. To publicize or not? That is <br/>

My friend was at a doctor's office last week and read an article in a <br/>
magazine (I'm not sure which one, but I'd be it's the same).  She <br/>
called me later and said, have you ever heard of this?  Of course, I <br/>
hadn't, but we were both very intrigued.  It took us a week to get <br/>
organized, but we went hunting yesterday and found our first three <br/>
boxes... the first was a mystery box!  Very exciting.<br/>
<br/>
We had a blast!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thattaway, here! I believe Letterboxing is as close to the perfect <br/>
hobby for us as is possible. For all the reasons you guys like it <br/>
plus the exercise, the walk with a goal, the serenity of a beautiful <br/>
trail mixed with the rush of the hunt and find and another way to <br/>
get the kids away from the TV. What's not to love?<br/>
<br/>
That's why I want to announce it from the hilltops so more people <br/>
can enjoy this addiction.........I mean hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Despite this yearning, I don't want to break any codes of discretion <br/>
or get a bad name by being too public. I can't believe I haven't <br/>
seen more articles about it but maybe there's a reason!<br/>
<br/>
I'm just trying to be an upstanding "member" and do whatever is best <br/>
for the "club". So I still ask, to publicize or not?<br/>
<br/>
Also, remember this is just a rookie's opinion, but I think the <br/>
Family Fun article was quite general and informative. I mean, <br/>
considering the name of the magazine, I guess it was promoting it as <br/>
just that, Family Fun, but it came with a glossary, start up guide, <br/>
web resources and history. I think it could nurture some <br/>
serious 'boxers and creative clues. As they say in Hollywood, <br/>
there's no such thing as bad publicity. Just my take. Nothing more.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>

Hi all-<br/>
Me, my wife, and our 2 sons, just started letterboxing after reading <br/>
an article in Family Fun Magazine. My 4 year old LOVES being the one <br/>

are letterboxing groups and events out here, like there seem to be <br/>

Looking forward to getting advice on our first box, that I hope to <br/>

&gt; Thattaway<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello Thattaway - there has been plenty of publicity, IMO *too* <br/>
much.  As a 'boxer of almost 3 years, with 40-something of my own <br/>
boxes hidden around 4 states, I've seen and heard of too many go <br/>
missing.  Again, IMO, it's due to the fact that the super-<br/>
enthusiastic newbie rushes out there without learning enough about <br/>
the game to keep our boxes safe - e.g. failing to learn the correct <br/>
way to re-hide boxes.  That's what it boils down to in order to keep <br/>
our 'boxes from being swiped, vandalized or dragged away by <br/>
critters.  I've seen MANY letterboxes "hidden" so poorly that anyone <br/>
passing by, letterboxer or not, can see them and this puts them in <br/>
jeopardy for being taken by "muggles" (non-boxers) who may simply <br/>
see them as "litter" boxes.  Not only is re-hiding important, but <br/>
also initially finding a suitable hiding place that's *not* so close <br/>
to the trail that it could be seen if not rehidden well.  Nor do you <br/>
want to hide it so far off trail that you impact the environment - <br/>
there's a delicate balance.<br/>
So, I implore you, *please* do plenty of research and learning about <br/>
letterboxing before you think any more about "publicity" or even <br/>
your child's school presentation.  There's so much more to know <br/>
about it than printing out clues and going to find boxes.  I know <br/>
you're enthusiastic and want to share this wonderful hobby - I was <br/>
too!  But once you've gained some knowledge, experience and time in <br/>
the game, you'll come to realize that these are precious gems that <br/>
folks are sharing with us and need TLC!  I can guarantee that you'll <br/>
feel this way if you take the time and care to carve, create and <br/>
hide your own boxes.<br/>
How can people find out about letterboxing then?  Just let <br/>
it happen "naturally" - maybe introduce a friend to it that you know <br/>
will be caring enough to take it seriously. It's a game all <br/>
about "stealth"!  I found out about it quite by accident when doing <br/>
a search on "geocaching"....I never did look any further into <br/>
geocaching once reading about letterboxing!!!  Most of <br/>
the "original" <br/>
letterboxers in USA read about it in Smithsonian magazine in the <br/>
90's I think it was.  <br/>
If you'd like me to email you an attachment of a brochure I've <br/>
developed for newbies entitled "Letterboxing 101", I'll be happy to <br/>
send it to you, but I'll need your email address to attach.  It's <br/>
something I've created to hand out at gatherings, so new boxers get <br/>
a "condensed" version of some letterboxing definitions and etiquette.<br/>
Other useful sites are Silent Doug's www.letterboxing.info, <br/>
www.Atlasquest.com has sections for new letterboxers, and the Yahoo <br/>
Talk Group for Newboxers is great too.<br/>
Well, I've vented enough, but please don't take it to the rooftops <br/>
just yet!!!! ;-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I read about LB in friend's blog and thought I'd give it a try with my five<br/>
kids (12, 6, 2, 9 months, 8 months).  We all loved it!  Everyone wanted<br/>
their own stamp so we started out with ones I found at Michael's  but we are<br/>
wanting a hand carved "family stamp" too.  We've found 4 letterboxes in two<br/>
outings and couldn't find two that we looked for (found out later one had<br/>
been "retired" - you have to read the fine print!  And one we gave up on<br/>
because we got caught in a storm.)  The kids love being outside and the<br/>
older ones love the treasure hunt aspect too.  Great activity for us - gets<br/>
us out of the house, outside and doing something everyone can do.  I also<br/>
see this as a hobby/activity/obsession that can grow with us.  Pretty<br/>
perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
