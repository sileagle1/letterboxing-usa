                    <div class="plaintext-content">Two weekends ago Sue, Tate, Melissa, Dan, the two crazy dogs Max and Maggie <br/>
and the adorable babies Sara and John Turner went on a hike with a reporter <br/>
and photographer from the New London Day (what a motley crew- eh?).  What a <br/>
surprise to see Sue and Sara on the front page this weekend!!!  Great picture <br/>
ladies! : )  The clues to the walk we took are as follows; I think you will <br/>
all agree that it is a beautiful place to explore.<br/>

Mystery Falls Letterbox<br/>
Placed 5/30/02 by Stephani, John, John Turner and Maggie the Dog<br/>
Duration of this walk could be anywhere from about an hour to three hours, <br/>
depending...<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is hidden along a section of the Narragansett Trail near Green <br/>
Falls Pond.  There are several ways to access this trail but we recommend <br/>
parking at the green gate on Green Falls Road.  To get to Green Falls Road:  <br/>
turn on to Sand Hill Road from Route 49 in Voluntown (this turn is marked by <br/>
the Studio Farm which sits on the corner); after turning left than right <br/>
around one of the Palmer farms in the area Green Falls Road goes straight <br/>
while Wheeler Road bears to the right; Green Falls Road quickly turns to a <br/>
dirt road; the Narragansett Trail (blue blazed) crosses once and a bit <br/>
further up on the left you will see the green gate; park here.<br/>
