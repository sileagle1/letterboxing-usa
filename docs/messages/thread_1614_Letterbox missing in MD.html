<br/>
I checked out the Lake Artemesia letterbox on Saturday and it is definately missing and will not be replaced. The area is just to public and I think some kids probably took it. It is a nice place to visit with lots of waterfowl in the city and song birds as well. Maybe this summer I will try again but for now toss those directions is you have them squirreled away somwwhere.<br/>
<br/>
And by the way who was that person who didn't see those big letters spelling out "NEW" at the top of the web page and couldn't find the what's new page? Thanks for your indulgence.<br/>
