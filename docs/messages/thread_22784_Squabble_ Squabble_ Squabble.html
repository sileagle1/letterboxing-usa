Well Jean this list is not letterboxing, but a discussion list <br/>
concerned with anything pertaining to our hobby. As long as remains <br/>
civil, which this thread has, then the discussion continues until the <br/>
horse has been beaten to death, which is fairly close now. If you are <br/>
looking for a list with less conflict and less give and take then you <br/>
have the option of using your fingers and locating either a regional <br/>
list or try the Newboxers list.<br/>
<br/>
newboxers' group:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Do we have to have a plethora of rules <br/>
&gt; and outspoken opinions?<br/>
<br/>
There is a common belief that "there are no rules", well at least not <br/>
much is in writing, but there is an abundance of outspoken opinions.<br/>
Presently we have a few fairly new letterboxers that seem to want to <br/>
change the game to their liking. At the same time on the other side of <br/>
this discussion is a group of older letterboxers that don't like <br/>
change, and any potential of dumbing down of the game. On the one side <br/>
you have a collection of folks that probably have a placed count of <br/>
nearly 100 letterboxes and have a collective time letterboxing of <br/>
maybe 1 1/2 years. On the other side my guess is that the placed count <br/>
exceeds 2000+ letterboxes and a collective time letterboxing in excess <br/>
of of 20 years. I tend to be on the side of the older letterboxers so <br/>
the P count and time letterboxing will be slightly higher. Now none of <br/>
the count or time I mentioned carries much official weight, but I <br/>
don't think that any new change will be coming soon. Sorry you are put <br/>
off with the squabble, but you have to realize that there are so many <br/>
ways folks play at this game, and with the creativity that flows <br/>
through the group there just can't be harmony much of the time.<br/>

<br/>
This is a discussion list.  Opinions are going to be out*spoken*.  Each<br/>
subject that you mention is something that people do have opinions about,<br/>
that there's rarely agreement about, and that's what a discussion list is<br/>
all about.<br/>
<br/>
Book clubs, artists' circles, theatre boards, church Vestries, any place two<br/>
or more people are gathered in the name of something where one plus one<br/>
doesn't always add up to two you just might see a discussion of differing<br/>
opinions.<br/>
<br/>
And yeah, it might get heated.  I'd rather be around a group of folks that<br/>
are passionate about their ideas than those that aren't.  Those that aren't<br/>
are far too prevalent in our society today as it is.<br/>
<br/>
Oops!  I just voiced another opinion!.....two of them!.........horrors!<br/>
I'll go hide my head in shame now.  Nah, I think I'd rather go murder some<br/>
M&amp;Ms.  Chocolate makes for a great Breakfast of Champions.   But then I was<br/>
always one to eat the dessert first.<br/>
