innocent) and we are wondering what the story is with it.  According<br/>
to the book, it was placed in July 2002, and transported a couple<br/>
times, the last in early August 2002, when a whole horde of LBers seem<br/>
to have found it in a group outing.  Then there is nothing more until<br/>
late August 2003. Surely it didn't vanish for a year, did it?  Anybody<br/>
know the story here?<br/>
