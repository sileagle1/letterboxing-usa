                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks!  That's what *I* thought, but the letterboxer I spoke to thought you <br/>
had to have 10 finds to wear it.  <br/>
<br/>
I think maybe she read the FAQ's where it says, "It is a letterboxing <br/>
tradition to create patches for finding a certain number of boxes (usually 100, and <br/>
then working up from there).  Some folks on the LbNA talk list have taken the <br/>
initiative and create a general letterboxing patch . . ."  Possibly the two <br/>
were connected in her mind.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm relieved I can use the patch.  I'm counting on it to identify me <br/>
if I ever run into any other letterboxers!<br/>
