Based on the article, it looks like I did everything wrong. It says I <br/>
should have frozen the book ASAP until I was ready to work on it, <br/>
then defrosted a page at a time using a hair dryer. When the book <br/>
starts to get wet again (because it is defrosting), be patient, re-<br/>
freeze the book, and continue another day. <br/>
<br/>
Patience, now!<br/>
