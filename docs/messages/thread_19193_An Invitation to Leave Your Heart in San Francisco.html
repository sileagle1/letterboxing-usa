                    <div class="plaintext-content">Big cheers, letterboxers around America! Knowing that many of you <br/>
come and visit San Francisco, and love our City by the Bay, I'd like <br/>
to announce a special new letterbox series, called: "I Left My <br/>
Heart".<br/>
<br/>
Please come to San Francisco (flowers in your hair are optional) <br/>
prepared to plant a letterbox in a place that's special to you, <br/>
where you'd like a bit of your heart to remain. Each box can follow <br/>
in sequence as follows: "I Left My Heart #1", "I Left My Heart #2", <br/>
and so on. <br/>
<br/>
Since there are so many visitors here, and some of them <br/>
letterboxers, we'll help make each other's visit much more <br/>
interesting -- and different from the standard tourist experience. <br/>
As for ongoing maintenance, I'm sure that a few of us locals will be <br/>
happy to provide some help, if needed.<br/>
<br/>
San Francisco has SO many unusual spots, a varied and fascinating <br/>
history, incredible views, and that lovable quirkiness that just <br/>
says, "Letterbox Me"!<br/>
<br/>
On behalf of San Francisco and Bay Area letterboxers, this is your <br/>
call to "leave your heart" here. Do you accept the invitation?<br/>
<br/>

It is in pencil right now. Gotta visit some friends in San Mateo and look at Scripps for <br/>
school perhaps. I'll get to the "left coast" sooner or latah! :-) Sounds like a lotta fun <br/>
though, wish I lived closer.<br/>

asked for her hand.  She said yes, of course.  We live in Texas and <br/>
don't plan on returning for a while, but if we ever do, I've got <br/>
dibs on that spot!<br/>
