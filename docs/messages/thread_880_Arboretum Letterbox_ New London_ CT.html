<p></p></b>Hi, we are avid letterbox hunters 
from Connecticut.  We finally took a break from searching to make our 
own.  We started with a short, easy hike suitable for all ages.  We 
also attempted to carve our own stamp!  We would love to post our clues to 
share with others.
<p><b>                    
</b>Thanks, Melissa &amp; Dan</p>

<p align="left">This is a single letterbox on an easy, level walk. Park at the 
Connecticut College Arboretum main entrance on Williams Street in New London, 
across the street from Connecticut College.</p>
<p align="left">At the entrance, take the trail at 215</p>°. Follow the woodchip 
covered trail until you come to a T intersection shaded by two large Tulip 
trees, with the pond directly ahead. Take a heading of 215°. Follow the main trail 
counterclockwise around the pond. On a nice day you may see dozens of painted 
turtles sunning themselves on the rocks. 
<p align="left">At the junction of the Bog Loop, Main Trail, and "5" 
take the trail at 255</p>°. At the next Y intersection go 315°. Follow this path to 
another intersection, where you will head North walking through Mountain Laurel, 
with a small bog on your right.
<p align="left">When you come to another T intersection with a small (10 foot) 
ledge straight in front of you, go to the North once again. Here you will walk 
through some more Mountain Laurel and a stone wall. </p>
<p align="left">After a short distance you will come to an open area. Go to 
"6" and head North. At the top of the little hill, facing a small 
quarried area, follow the path heading 295</p>°. At the next intersection 
take a heading of 300°. Take a peak at the remains of another quarried area 
used to build some of the buildings on campus. Then continue straight along your 
path for a short while, looking for a smaller path at 205°. 
<p align="left">Follow this path over a small area of exposed ledge and down a set 
of stone stairs, with a southerly flowing stream below on your right. When you 
come to a large dead evergreen (never-green?) clinging to the cliff on your 
right, bushwack directly east up and over two small ledge steps and through the 
trees until you come upon a larger ledge face (8 foot high) . Find the Arboretum 
Box tucked into a rocky crevice in it’s northern end in the shade of a 
split oak tree.</p>
<p>To return to your car, follow your tracks back the way you came or continue 
to explore the Arboretum trails. </p></div></body></html>
