                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been trying to update my clues to show that a box has been  reported <br/>
possibly missing, but have been unable to sign in for some reason. I'm  not <br/>
sure what I'm doing wrong. I sign in with my e-mail address and password but  <br/>
then it pulls up "Welcome anonymous user". I can't get on to edit my clues. I  <br/>
don't want people to be upset if they go to find it and I haven't noted it on  <br/>
the clue. <br/>
   The box is the "Anniversary Box" which is part of the "PEACE"  series in <br/>
Des Moines, WA. It was a box that I ressurected out of the  letterboxing <br/>
basement and I feel just awful if it is truly missing. Thanks to  Amanda for <br/>
reporting this to me on 9/29. I will confirm it missing in the next  couple days. I <br/>
am hoping maybe the original placer, whom I could never contact,  has possibly <br/>
collected it. I will probably be replacing it with another box  soon. <br/>
The other 2 boxes "Peace" and "Bury the Hatchet" are reported alive and  <br/>
well.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Hi Snickerdoodle,<br/>
<br/>
If you can get ahold of Wes Garrison, the database manager, he may be <br/>
able to help you.  But good luck :-(<br/>
<br/>
Some problems are fixable, but some problems apparently are not.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since we migrated over to the new database system, I can edit my <br/>
boxes, but I cannot add new boxes.  So now I have a whole bunch of <br/>
boxes out there and they are not in the LbNA clues database.  I've <br/>
stopped planting because if folks can't find the clues in here, they <br/>
aren't going to be able to find the letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
I have sent Wes a few emails over the last few weeks reminding him of <br/>
this months and months old problem (he's been aware of it since Day <br/>
One), but I am getting no answers (and by that I mean replies by Wes <br/>
via email).  Perhaps he is on vacation or no longer maintains the <br/>
database code?<br/>
<br/>
Wes?  Can you hear us?<br/>

not planting and posting, consider posting the clues on AtlasQuest <br/>
(http://www.atlasquest.com/).  At least they'll be accessible to <br/>
people looking!<br/>
<br/>
I don't particularly like having to go to mulitple places to find <br/>
clues, but I suppose that's part of the element of this hobby.  For <br/>
the two boxes I've placed, I've included them in both databases -- <br/>
LbNA and AtlasQuest.  One nice feature about AtlasQuest is that you <br/>
can track your finds.  I like both databases.<br/>

<br/>
Yahoo Groups and LbNA are not interlinked any way, shape or form.  <br/>
They require different login screens.  If the LbNA site already <br/>
knows who you are, it's probably because there's a checkbox when you <br/>
first logged in that you had clicked to automatically log you into <br/>
LbNA from that computer.<br/>

I don't have any solutions to the problems mentioned (sorry about <br/>
that!), but I do know the solution proposed here isn't going to <br/>
work.  =)  (Sounds like a lot of managers out there, huh?  *wink*)<br/>

me and  I can't even get to the place where it says to go to my boxes.  So I <br/>
guess  I can't do it! I'm not sure why. So Ryan, how do I post my clues to <br/>
AtlasQuest?  Can I just copy and paste? I really appreciate everyones help. I <br/>
guess this  maybe explains to some of those people complaining why people don't <br/>
update their  boxes when they are reported missing. Maybe some have the same <br/>
problem I'm  having. I do have to admit I'm not very computer savy so this sure <br/>
could just be  something I'm doing wrong and not the site at all. But it does <br/>
sound like others  have had this problem also.<br/>
