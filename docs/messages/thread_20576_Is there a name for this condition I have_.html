Steps? I'm sorry, I read that as paces...?<br/>

Here's to hoping we all eventually end up at the same place - at <br/>
least 12 steps from De Nile (and no, it's not in Egypt.=)<br/>

SO cool to see more folks in Idaho hooked.....Yay!!!  I haven't <br/>
checked this site in forever as we've had computer problems...invaded <br/>
by pop-ups and then had to buy another computer and internet provider <br/>
so we're slowly getting hooked back into internet world....hope to be <br/>
out there letterboxing more too.  =-)<br/>

Wondered where you were! Sorry to hear about your computer problems--seems to <br/>
be going around. My daughter had the same problem and lost everything <br/>
including her precious photos! Seems our reminders to "back things up" won't sound <br/>
like nagging any more. . .<br/>
