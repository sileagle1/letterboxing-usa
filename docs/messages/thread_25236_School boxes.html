The start of school includes "lockdown" drills, in which every door is locked, every light is off, and every adult and child is quiet and hidden.  This is the post-Columbine edition of the "duck and cover" drill.<br/>
<br/>
In a real lockdown, you'd also have the school informing, later, the parents of every child in the school and you'd have a ton of cops and other emergency responders flying to the school.  There would also be lots of news coverage of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry for an ominous and unpleasant post, but my point is that an unfamiliar adult wandering school grounds with a backpack while reading a piece of paper could trigger a lockdown.  <br/>
<br/>
So, if you are looking for a box at or near a school, please do so when the school is closed.<br/>
