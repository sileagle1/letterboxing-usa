                    <html><body>Darrin and I finally got out to Goodwin State Forest with enough daylight to get the Bear Family letterbox!  If you have followed our posts for the last two weeks, we have gone out there looking for Ants and Celestial Series' then run out of daylight on the way back to the car!  In Hampton, we also found Airline Hampton Station, No Bull, Hampton Resevoir, and Hidden Fish Ponds Letterbox, all in good shape!
<br/>
<br/>One sad note, we were unable to find the Trailwoods Back Door Letterbox in Hampton.  We looked in every conceivable place in the corner of the wall with no luck.  Is it missing, Chuck?  
<br/>
<br/>We were really bummed to not find the Trailwoods Back Door after all the hassle it was to get it.  We took our bikes on the railroad trail, then left them at the "railroad" boulder in the clues.  We had to go all of the way back in to get them after looking... and if you have found the box, you know why I am ticked off at myself for not reading the clues more carefully!  That was SO not fair Chuck!  (LOL)
<br/>
<br/>We ended the day at the Lily Pad to purchase some pink stuff.... the guy told me that it just came in yesterday, and I answered, "well, it's all over the internet that you have it in!"  He was a little bit startled, but I told him that Carolyn told all of us on the list that he had it in stock, and he then understood.  Carolyn.... you must have a lot of clout there!  He specifically said that you specifically ask them to keep it in stock just for you ;-)  
<br/>
<br/>All in all, a good day!  We hope to try for the Trailwoods letterbox again soon!
