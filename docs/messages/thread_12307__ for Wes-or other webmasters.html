one (Swan Valley) was listed still on the What's New page.  I would be happy<br/>
to transfer that over for you and save you the effort, but that page only<br/>
had the more recent additions today while the clue still wasn't listed on<br/>
the old map.  I'm afraid it's in no-mans land and I don't necessarily want<br/>
to rewrite all the text.  Is there a place to access it?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, one of the new clues (Bingham Copper Mine Letterbox) had been<br/>
listed on the talk list, but not made it to the What's New page.  I went<br/>
ahead and put it in the new database, so don't worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a ton for all your work.  You guys are just amazing!!!! <br/>
