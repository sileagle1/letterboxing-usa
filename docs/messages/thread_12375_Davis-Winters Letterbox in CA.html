Nearest town: Davis, CA 95616<br/>

<br/>
Davis-Winters Letterbox:<br/>
This expedition is about a seven mile trek,<br/>
We suggest you ride a bike, or your feet will give you  heck.<br/>
Driving a car is no good,<br/>
Our path leads you through the Davis 'hood.<br/>
<br/>
Where can you buy food by the load?<br/>
At Albertson's on Anderson Road.<br/>
<br/>
Go South, abide by the rule,<br/>
Approaching Cesar Chavez Elementary School.<br/>
Look close, there is a path on the right,<br/>
Rutgers is the street, turn at the traffic light.<br/>
<br/>
Pass a small garden,<br/>
Continue into the school,<br/>
The path curves left, head across the courts.<br/>
Continue straight - do you see the white post? <br/>
<br/>
Now you are facing Cornell and Maple<br/>
The journey has just begun, are you capable?<br/>
<br/>
Bike down Cornell to Sycamore,<br/>
Do you need to know anymore?<br/>
Of course you do, that wouldn't be right.<br/>
Make a left and 8th street is in sight.<br/>
<br/>
On 8th, make a right, the street curves into Wake Forest Drive<br/>
Castilian Hall is looking alive.<br/>
Make a right on the first street, Guava Lane<br/>
I hope our directions aren't driving you insane.<br/>
<br/>
Guava ends in a court, near Pinon Apartment<br/>
Do you know where you have been sent?<br/>
Look left, it's a Frisbee golf course<br/>
Follow the path uyntil you reach a fork.<br/>
Go right and travel through an "alley" bordered by a building and <br/>
bushes.<br/>
<br/>
Then take a right; ride your bike on the sidewalk.<br/>
You might recognize the street as Russell, not a a tomahawk.<br/>
Head over the freeway, and go through two lights.<br/>
At the third make a left on Arthur Street.<br/>
Now you are on Howard Reese Commemorative Bike Path,<br/>
Say hello to Lincoln, he will make you laugh.<br/>
<br/>
Now the path heads west for a few miles<br/>
Follow it and watch the sheep for a while.<br/>
After some time you will run into "the land of the stop signs".<br/>
After obeying the rules of the road,<br/>
Look left to see a desert abode.<br/>
This Green Desert will catch your eye,<br/>
Don't fall in or you might die!<br/>
<br/>
The bike path ends, you need to cross the street.<br/>
So make a right, it will be neat.<br/>
After the cross, you will pass Kingdom Hall,<br/>
Out in this farmland, you won't find any mall.<br/>
<br/>
The path ends again; don't you cheat.<br/>
Look both ways before crossing the street.<br/>
Up and down the dips you go;<br/>
Where you'll end up, only we know.<br/>
<br/>
Now pay attention, this intersection is tricky,<br/>
Up ahead you should see a flower and plant nursery.<br/>
Take a left, onto 95 A.<br/>
The road makes a "U"; it doesn't take all day.<br/>
<br/>
Head south for a little while.<br/>
Your destination is less than a mile.<br/>
Are you at Creek's Edge?<br/>
Don't overstep, there is a ledge.<br/>
<br/>
Go over Stevenson's Bridge and follow the curve to the left.<br/>
Slow down or you might miss the loot.<br/>
Park in the turnout and continue on foot.<br/>
<br/>
Head down the path on the left,<br/>
Stairs have been carved into the slope,<br/>
Following them down is your only hope.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the stairs a fallen log is in sight.<br/>
Take 13 paces towards it to the right.<br/>
Now you are standing in front of the log,<br/>
Peer underneath, but you're not looking for a frog!<br/>
We've hidden the box under a concrete rock,<br/>
Open it up, there is no lock.<br/>
