love trains so this one was perfect for us.  We enjoy the longer walks since <br/>
they are great exercise!  This was a great walk and would even be fine to <br/>
take a stroller along as the boxes aren't too far from the trail.  The <br/>
directions were excellent and the stamps are really, really nice.  My <br/>
creative ability is so limited I really appreciate hand-carved stamps!  We <br/>
have found the World's Smallest Hitchhiker at the last box of this 3 box set <br/>
which made the day perfect.  Now, where to hide it next...............  <br/>
Great job, Team Weems!<br/>
