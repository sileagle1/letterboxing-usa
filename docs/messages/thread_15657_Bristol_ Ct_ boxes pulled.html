Challenge Series because of a missing report and sure enough the <br/>
Mutant Swamp Frog got away (with human help) The second one was quite <br/>
wet (again) so with his permission I took what was left of it and <br/>
have removed it from the list. Thanks to all who patronized it and <br/>
there were many (we checked it often). <br/>
On the last page of the log book there was a note which said:<br/>
       Your other box was destroyed by idiots. We found<br/>
       parts of it scattered. Sorry!<br/>

Kind of restores my faith in the human race. Thanks, Don<br/>
