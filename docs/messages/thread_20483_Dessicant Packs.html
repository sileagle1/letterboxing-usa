                    <div class="plaintext-content">I used a fairly large commercial dessicant pack in a letterbox on <br/>
placed on the 13th of September. It held probably near two <br/>
tablespoons of "dehumidifier". <br/>
<br/>
A few days later, we were inundated with rain by the then-remnants <br/>
of Hurricane Ivan. That's a LOT of moisture! The creek just 40 feet <br/>
away from the box's position was 2 to 3 feet above normal.<br/>
<br/>
Then we had a drastic temp change, down to the low 50s at night from <br/>
a humid 80 during the day. A good chance for lots of condensation.<br/>
<br/>
Well, good news... I checked the box on Friday, and though there was <br/>
condensation on the OUTSIDE of the box, there was NONE INSIDE.<br/>
<br/>
There may be one important thing to consider when choosing a <br/>
dessicant: what the material was designed for...<br/>
The packs you find in shoeboxes, electronics, and things like that <br/>
are designed to pull moisture from the air; they don't do squat when <br/>
in direct contact with liquids. Kitty litter, especially the new <br/>
crystal stuff, works when it is in direct contact with liquids; it <br/>
does nothing (except maybe make your litterbox--I mean, your <br/>
letterbox--smell nice) as far as pulling moisture from the air!<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm curious to see how the box I placed two days earlier <br/>
faired... it doesn't have a dessicant pack!<br/>
