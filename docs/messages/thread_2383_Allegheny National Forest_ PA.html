<div>Greetings,</div>
<div>    My partner, Bob LaBelle/Cock o' the Trail, 
and I recently returned from the National Forest after searching there for 
Bryan's four letterboxes.  Having had no email response from Bryan after 
advising him of several glitches we encountered, I'll post our 
findings.</div>
<div>    <u>Porcupine &amp; Turkey Vulture:</u> we 
found the site quite handily, but not the boxes.  After an hour or more in 
the area we suspect they have been removed.</div>
<div>    <u>Crayfish &amp; Spring Peeper:</u> we 
found both boxes after considerable confusion.  In each of Bryan's clues it 
reads - walk <u>east</u> on the trail.  After 30 minutes with no success, 
thanks to my partner we decided to walk <u>west</u> on the trail after he 
realized the eastern terrain didn't quite match the clues.  We found both 
boxes and our persistence paid off.  The stamps are beautifully carved and 
we were pleased to add them to our growing collection.</div>
