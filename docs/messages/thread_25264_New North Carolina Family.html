I am very excited, my kids and I have just decided to start letter boxing.  The only downside is we live in an area where there are no boxes.  So, I was wondering if anyone ever gets together in a group to letterbox?  There are lots of boxes within driving distance for us, but with directions like 'start at the X firestation', it's a little difficult (though not impossible) to get started.  Well, if not, then the kiddos and I will strike out on our own, Raleigh seems like a good start....<br/>

You can contact the person that planted the box and ask questions.  Such as better directions to the area of the box.<br/>
<br/>
If the box is still active.  Check the clues.  It has a spot that says contact the planter.  <br/>
<br/>
Go to an area that has more then one box so you will not be disappointed if you don't get letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
We do letterboxing when we go on vacation, visit our family in other states etc.  Sometimes we are <br/>
<br/>
unsuccessful in fining a box but most of the times we do.  The good part is you always go to places you <br/>
<br/>
would never would to gone.  You get to visit out place in our country.  It's always an adventure and a great <br/>
<br/>
way to spend with your family without TV, phones, etc.<br/>

<br/>
assuming that you are in the raleigh area??<br/>
<br/>
we went to an event in the DURHAM area last DEC 2010<br/>
and most of the boxes are permanent plants<br/>
<br/>
and since DISNEY theme...many would be interesting to the chids..<br/>
<br/>
we live in ALEXANDER county...and there are almost NO LB's here<br/>
<br/>
but we travel around and print out clues to whereever we are journeying that day<br/>
