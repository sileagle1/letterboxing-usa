<br/>
It occurred to me that since access to New Age Letterboxing (a.k.a. <br/>
the database) is now being denied to all, that it might benefit some <br/>
to see a list of boxes being reported there. Therefore I have placed <br/>
a list of all boxes in the database (as of 11/28) at<br/>
<br/>
http://home.gwi.net/~moxie1/db1.htm<br/>
<br/>
I believed I have stripped out all comments, spoilers, and other <br/>
potentially objectionable material, and left just a list of which <br/>
boxes are in there.<br/>
<br/>
As a member of this group that promotes open access to information, <br/>
I'm just doing my part to make this information available to everyone <br/>
who might be interested. <br/>
<br/>
I do hope this is helpful.<br/>

The database in question is the one at the "New Age Letterboxing" <br/>
group, a sister group to the one to which you have just posted. It <br/>
contains extended information about all of those letterboxes from my <br/>
earlier post. They feel they do not require your permission to place <br/>
this extended information about your box in a (semi) public forum. <br/>

NewAge is in no way a "sister group" of this one.<br/>
And I don't see where the database is any different than posting a <br/>
sitrep here. Except that with a sitrep, I could go find a mystery box <br/>
and then come home and post any info I wanted to about it. I could <br/>
flat out say exactly where it's located. That doesn't happen on <br/>
NewAge. In fact, it's one of our rules. <br/>
You people want us to ask permission to comment on one of your boxes. <br/>
The next thing you know, you'll want us to ask permission before we <br/>
even go attempt to find your box. What next?? Do we need your <br/>
permission to breath near your boxes too?!<br/>
<br/>
The only thing Isosceles did in posting the name of every box on our <br/>
database is to inflame this war. Now everyone will be posting and <br/>
whining and it's all thanks to Isosceles. Smooth move. <br/>
<br/>
And please, if you don't want your boxes on our database, feel free <br/>
to email me. Then I can just ignore your email too (just like I was <br/>
accused of doing to Funhog.) And for the record, my co-moderator <br/>
emailed Funhog in response to their email to me, and they have yet to <br/>
get back to her. Talk about letting a communication die. <br/>
<br/>
And if anyone thinks I'm being childish now, you're right. I think <br/>
all this bitchin' and moanin' by these so called "esteemed <br/>
letterboxers" is kinda funny. So I won't remove any boxes from the <br/>
database, just to make them piss and moan more. Keep it up! I'm <br/>
havin' a ball!!  :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks.  Having read some of the other posts, I've gathered that this New Age list does not give out clues but box status.  Is that <br/>
true? I wish I could read that's there about my boxes, so if anything's incorrect I could update it.  The main thing that concerned me in <br/>
reading over the list of boxes in the New Age database is that it has one of my mystery boxes.  I hope nothing about the location is <br/>
given away, but now I can't find out!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I post feedback about my boxes on my clue pages.  For me, that seems the best place to put status info, since a person <br/>
can't find a box without the clue.  If there is no comment about status on one of my clues, hunters can assume all is well.<br/>
