Jesse, frankly many of us DON'T want Letterboxing spread around in <br/>
this way, so please don't add another article that <br/>
attracts "infatuation" to the hobby.  The majority of these folks who <br/>
read the articles don't bother to *really* learn about Letterboxing <br/>
before jumping in to go on this exciting-sounding "treasure hunt", <br/>
often jeopardizing our 'boxes.  It is a game of stealth, and they <br/>
usually just don't get that...<br/>
Please reconsider, and if you like the hobby so much, just introduce <br/>
it to a few of your friends who you know will also enjoy and respect <br/>
it.  Word of mouth is the only way Letterboxing should be "spread" in <br/>
my opinion!<br/>

Yes, Jesse, the thrill of discovery is much better than being spoonfed.<br/>
People who happen upon letterboxing seem to stay with it and are more dedicated than those led to it by the media - who often miss the nuances of the game.<br/>

She is loved by all who know her and as a friend, I'm insulted that her post was read that way and she was called names. Her poster and brochure came about when letterboxers on the Newboxers list wanted to know about certain items. It was so well received by the over 2000 members on the newbies list, that Sojourner graciously agreed to go public with it.<br/>
These are the type of attacks that hurt this list and cause it to lose members. Sojourner did this with the best of intentions and those at the Newboxers list and others applaud her!<br/>

What a conceded, stuck up snob you are.<br/>
<br/>
Basically your whole post comes down to you not wanting "those kinds of <br/>
people." At least that is how I read it. But of course what am I to <br/>
expect from someone who sends poster boards to gatherings telling people <br/>
how they should play the game?<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand you folks complain that articles are written without <br/>
ever getting information from letterboxers themselves, but on the other <br/>
hand, when asked, you berate the reporter and tell them they should not <br/>
write the article, that it will attract the wrong type of people. Well, <br/>
you are going to have some give and take in anything, and I think these <br/>
articles have attracted lots of the right kinds of people too.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">interesting debate......It's odd that most boxers on this list basically oppose letterboxing being spread in print, but only to their friends.  Even more odd, is the fact that an article in Smithsonian Magazine brought it here to the USA, and others I know that love the hobby and are great for it read about it in Family Fun magazine, or other publications.  So that kinda baffles me.  Seems selfish to wanna keep something all to yourself...but I understand that folks worry about their boxes.<br/>
<br/>
  I was interviewed for and article here in VA last year, and was sure to mention to the interviewer, concerns that we may have and was given editing rights.  I included a clue to a box in it for the newbies to find.  In it was take home info about the hobby, and our concern.  It was a tempoary box and was pulled after 6 weeks.  It only has 2 visitors and it was by boxers that had been boxing for over 3 years and I knew.  This was for me to guage this kinda debate that newbies via articles in print are bad....My conclusion: not true.<br/>
<br/>
  Personally i think that Girl Scout Troops (not all...!) are worse for the sport.  I have found 2 boxes from girl scouts.  One was a rusty tin can, basically litter...with no stamp in it, and the other was a black trash bag.....<br/>
<br/>
  I have an open mind and always keep in mind that we are adults, acting like kids, looking for stamps...nothing more....have fun.<br/>

 how they should play the game?<br/>

 On the one hand you folks complain that articles are written without <br/>

 you are going to have some give and take in anything, and I think these <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In my area a new letterboxer in the next city (about a 15 minute <br/>
drive) gave an interview to their local newspaper. It was actually a <br/>
really well written article with lovely photos of the letterboxer's <br/>
children looking for boxes in the park. The article gave explicit <br/>
word-for-word directions to one of my local letterboxes. <br/>
<br/>
I checked on the box every other day for about a week then once a <br/>
week for a couple of weeks. Not a single visitor <sigh> but when I <br/>
went over to the neighboring city to find boxes hidden by these new <br/>
letterboxers, they had about 6 new letterboxers visit their boxes, <br/>
all mentioning the article in the local paper, some had even carved <br/>
their own sig stamp. None of the letterboxer's boxes were taken. My <br/>
conclusion agrees with yours BullDawg: not true, that articles in <br/>
print are bad. The Smithsonian article is how I found out about <br/>
letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
We need to put our letterboxes into perspective. We are hiding <br/>
something out in a public spot, there are all kinds of things that <br/>
can contribute to their loss. Think of it as something ephemeral, <br/>
look an outdoor chalk drawing eventually it's going to get washed <br/>
away by the weather or maybe someone will come by and deliberately <br/>
erase it, but it was nice while it lasted and brought a smile to <br/>
those who got to visit it. <br/>

I know I was introduced to letterboxing from an article I read in a<br/>
newspaper I happened to get while in Boot Camp. I tore out the article,<br/>
stuck it in my journal and mailed it home to my girlfriend. When I got home<br/>
we decided to give it a shot. Got a journal, a stamp and started hiking<br/>
together. It has since become an excellent hobby of ours.<br/>
<br/>
So I suppose I am one of those types of people who was brought into the<br/>
hobby through a news article. Not everyone who gets into it that way is bad.<br/>
I either case thanks for the feedback.<br/>

<br/>
interesting debate......It's odd that most boxers on this list basically<br/>
oppose letterboxing being spread in print, but only to their friends.  Even<br/>
more odd, is the fact that an article in Smithsonian Magazine brought it<br/>
here to the USA, and others I know that love the hobby and are great for it<br/>
read about it in Family Fun magazine, or other publications.  So that kinda<br/>
baffles me.  Seems selfish to wanna keep something all to yourself...but I<br/>
understand that folks worry about their boxes.<br/>
<br/>
  I was interviewed for and article here in VA last year, and was sure to<br/>
mention to the interviewer, concerns that we may have and was given editing<br/>
rights.  I included a clue to a box in it for the newbies to find.  In it<br/>
was take home info about the hobby, and our concern.  It was a tempoary box<br/>

that had been boxing for over 3 years and I knew.  This was for me to guage<br/>
this kinda debate that newbies via articles in print are bad....My<br/>
conclusion: not true.<br/>
<br/>
  Personally i think that Girl Scout Troops (not all...!) are worse for the<br/>
sport.  I have found 2 boxes from girl scouts.  One was a rusty tin can,<br/>
basically litter...with no stamp in it, and the other was a black trash<br/>
bag.....<br/>
<br/>
  I have an open mind and always keep in mind that we are adults, acting<br/>
like kids, looking for stamps...nothing more....have fun.<br/>

  Can anybody support the agruement via hard facts, that newpaper articles lead to bad boxers, and more lost boxes?...I have had plenty of lost boxes, before any articles were out in my area...and most likely a result of bad rehides, animals, or nature.  I have had well reped boxers report to me they they accidently took the stamp home, or accidently ripped the stamp in 2 via their kids...Neither were newbies.  Are there facts to support this?...or is the uproar about newspaper articles, just not wanting so share a hobby?..if so, i dont understand that mentality.<br/>

  I apologize if you took my post on the Girl Scouts thw wrong way...They were just not good leaders.<br/>

were not taught properly. I am a leader. My girls are going into third<br/>
grade next year. I have not taken them boxing yet because I decided to wait<br/>
until they are older. When I decide to take them I will first do a workshop<br/>
to teach them what is expected of letterboxers. If I didn't do that and<br/>
they did something you feel is wrong it would be my fault not the troop and<br/>
not girl scouts in general.<br/>

<br/>
interesting debate......It's odd that most boxers on this list basically<br/>
oppose letterboxing being spread in print, but only to their friends. Even<br/>
more odd, is the fact that an article in Smithsonian Magazine brought it<br/>
here to the USA, and others I know that love the hobby and are great for it<br/>
read about it in Family Fun magazine, or other publications. So that kinda<br/>
baffles me. Seems selfish to wanna keep something all to yourself...but I<br/>
understand that folks worry about their boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I was interviewed for and article here in VA last year, and was sure to<br/>
mention to the interviewer, concerns that we may have and was given editing<br/>
rights. I included a clue to a box in it for the newbies to find. In it<br/>
was take home info about the hobby, and our concern. It was a tempoary box<br/>
and was pulled after 6 weeks. It only has 2 visitors and it was by boxers<br/>
that had been boxing for over 3 years and I knew. This was for me to guage<br/>
this kinda debate that newbies via articles in print are bad....My<br/>
conclusion: not true.<br/>
<br/>
Personally i think that Girl Scout Troops (not all...!) are worse for the<br/>
sport. I have found 2 boxes from girl scouts. One was a rusty tin can,<br/>
basically litter...with no stamp in it, and the other was a black trash<br/>
bag.....<br/>
<br/>
I have an open mind and always keep in mind that we are adults, acting<br/>
like kids, looking for stamps...nothing more....have fun.<br/>

&gt; Jesse, frankly many of us DON'T want Letterboxing spread around in <br/>
&gt; this way, so please don't add another article that attracts <br/>
&gt; "infatuation" to the hobby. The majority of these folks who read the <br/>
&gt; articles don't bother to *really* learn about Letterboxing before <br/>
&gt; jumping in to go on this exciting-sounding "treasure hunt", often <br/>
&gt; jeopardizing our 'boxes. It is a game of stealth, and they usually <br/>
&gt; just don't get that...<br/>
&gt; Please reconsider, and if you like the hobby so much, just introduce <br/>
&gt; it to a few of your friends who you know will also enjoy and respect <br/>
&gt; it. Word of mouth is the only way Letterboxing should be "spread" in <br/>
&gt; my opinion!<br/>

<br/>
What a conceded, stuck up snob you are.<br/>
<br/>
Basically your whole post comes down to you not wanting "those kinds of<br/>
people." At least that is how I read it. But of course what am I to expect<br/>
from someone who sends poster boards to gatherings telling people how they<br/>
should play the game?<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand you folks complain that articles are written without ever<br/>
getting information from letterboxers themselves, but on the other hand,<br/>
when asked, you berate the reporter and tell them they should not write the<br/>
article, that it will attract the wrong type of people. Well, you are going<br/>
to have some give and take in anything, and I think these articles have<br/>
attracted lots of the right kinds of people too.<br/>

Yes, I do.  Could it have been the result of other things?  Possibly, but<br/>
the timing is suspicious, and when it recurs in the same timeframe?  Come on<br/>
now.  It's the article.<br/>
<br/>

- I consider a few GS leaders to be my personal friends and they are both<br/>
great letterboxers and great leaders, but THEY also teach their girls LB'ing<br/>
properly.  HOWEVER, since the advent of the Hi Tech Hide and Seek activity<br/>
badge, many GS leaders take it upon themselves to teach something they know<br/>
nothing of (and this bugs me in Cub Scouting too, which is where I donate my<br/>
time - I get a little peeved by computer techs trying to teaching forestry<br/>
instead of calling in a forester).  They teach letterboxing and geocaching<br/>
as an activity to while away an afternoon, much like going to the movie or<br/>
going skating.  They don't take into account that it is an interactive<br/>
interest that thrives on give and take, that changes a bit every time a box<br/>
is found or planted, and that calls for respect of property as well as other<br/>
people.  They don't realize that someone had to make an investment in that<br/>
little bit of tupperware before it could provide entertainment for their<br/>
girls.  And THAT is also why I think so much journalism is also bad for<br/>
letterboxing - journalists who don't take the time to understand the people<br/>
side of letterboxing, who just want to write about a cool and little<br/>

shelf if it happens to break or if it doesn't suit them.<br/>

<br/>
Hence why I have asked for input from people who do the activity outside<br/>
myself. I've been letterboxing for a few years and have had a wonderful time<br/>
doing so. I figured reaching out to others for insight would lend itself to<br/>
a better article and though I do not have someone to interview yet, I have<br/>
gotten excellent feedback from the resulting conversation. Your comments<br/>
will help shape this into what I believe to be a good article and I will do<br/>
my best ti emphasize the etiquette behind letterboxing as well as the<br/>
activity itself.<br/>

  Great side, and if that has happened to you via a post-newpaper article, you are justified to feel so....I just dont understand those that dont want others to know of this hobby, for no reason than they want it to be a secret or "ours"...after all we were all led to it somehow.<br/>
<br/>
  Another reason I did the interview with the newspaper, was they had contacted 4-5 boxers in the area, and I thought I might be able to protect it best.....If someone says, "no"..another newer boxer will say "YES" to the interviewer.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">While I was being somewhat sarcastic, the sarcasm was, unfortunately, based<br/>
in experience.<br/>
<br/>
Let me give you a little background.  When I started boxing nearly 4 years<br/>
ago, there were 7 boxes within about an hour and a half of me, and most of<br/>
those were within 30 minutes of each other.  It didn't take me long to find<br/>
them all.  There wasn't another boxer that I knew of then or that I've heard<br/>
of since who was active at that time within 100 miles in any direction of me<br/>
and my family.  We sat around and WAITED, and started planting, and attended<br/>
a gathering, and that was how we got our boxing fix.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly before the second annual Texas gathering, a reporter emailed me and<br/>
the other two placers of boxes in my county, Silver Eagle and Baby Bear (who<br/>
both live quite a distance away), and asked to do an article.  Desperate for<br/>
some company around here, I wanted to do the article.  SE and BB and I were<br/>
in touch with each other and we agreed what would be best said to the<br/>
reporter and what we should emphasize.  The reporter did a pretty decent job<br/>
really, and she managed to emphasize the stealth factor, the people side of<br/>
it, and did her article without giving away the farm.  All in all, decent<br/>
publicity.  The net result was about four bites - and all but one of those<br/>
gave up almost immediately when they couldn't find a box or two (which were<br/>
there, by the way, because I made a sweep of the whole county right before<br/>
the article to verify that everything was in good order).  The one that<br/>
stuck for a few months wound up planting several boxes, then jumping out and<br/>
leaving them all orphaned and in the wild and those boxes are STILL a<br/>
problem around here.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, the Texas talk list kicked off and Silver Eagle and I<br/>
co-moderate it together.  We began to notice large influxes of joiners every<br/>
time there was an article somewhere.  And it wasn't long after each article<br/>
that established boxers started seeing signs of degradation in their boxes.<br/>
Still though, we were getting some quality boxers and boxes coming in.  And<br/>
more articles would come along, and more problems, and yes, more quality<br/>
boxers too.  A cycle.<br/>
<br/>
Now Texas has always been very welcoming to new boxers - we have a great<br/>
list and a wonderful group of folks and we've greeted newbies with great<br/>
enthusiasm and worked really hard to get them up and running quickly.<br/>
However, it's gotten to where every time a new article comes along (and<br/>
realize, I'm talking about any print article, not just local paper), we all<br/>
cringe and hold on tight, wondering which boxes will disappear with this<br/>
round.  What I find interesting is that with each one, we get more traffic<br/>
and more problems, but we still only glean about the same number of good<br/>
boxers state-wide.   We still love our newbies, but it gets a little wearing<br/>
paying the price for getting them.<br/>
<br/>
I am not saying that all letterboxing publicity is bad.  I think all of it<br/>
has a downside, even the percentage of publicity that is good.  I AM saying<br/>
that as letterboxers, if we choose to participate in publicity, we have a<br/>
responsibility to the entire community to demand a certain level of quality<br/>
from the journalists that cover us and we need to be prepared to take the<br/>
weight of the consequences squarely on our shoulders.<br/>
<br/>
Would I personally choose to participate in a news article again?  Possibly,<br/>
but highly unlikely.  First of all, it didn't glean anything for us in the<br/>
long run, and secondly, had I realized then the two-edged sword that<br/>
publicity can be, I wouldn't have thought it to be worth the price. And I<br/>
think we did things right with our reporter - we agreed together what to say<br/>
and what information to give and what direction we wanted the article to go,<br/>
and we insisted she agree to our terms before we talked to her.  AND she had<br/>
done her homework and hunted us down indvidually, so she had demonstrated a<br/>
little umph in getting the story and she proved herself to be a responsible<br/>
journalist.  But if I did it again, it would be with a critical eye on the<br/>
bigger picture, even beyond my little corner of letterboxingland.<br/>

Our family took it to heart, our carvings have improved and we have left a trail of pretty decent boxes to be found. We in turn introduced our parents who are now on about 100 finds. We find, plant and pick up litter all according to rules and regulations. If not for the article we would have never found this amazing hobby. While it may lead to random boxers who find 1 or 2 and then quit, the articles also lead to many who improve and add to this amazing hobby. Can you ever control all the bad or even all the good that comes out of articles. No. You can make it only WOM but then, how do you regenerate and revitalize and get new boxes if no one new comes in. I understand both sides having planted and found but I am grateful for the article as this has given my family a whole new way to come together. The B Hunters<br/>

<br/>
Can anybody support the agruement via hard facts, that newpaper articles lead to bad boxers, and more lost boxes?...I have had plenty of lost boxes, before any articles were out in my area...and most likely a result of bad rehides, animals, or nature. I have had well reped boxers report to me they they accidently took the stamp home, or accidently ripped the stamp in 2 via their kids...Neither were newbies. Are there facts to support this?...or is the uproar about newspaper articles, just not wanting so share a hobby?..if so, i dont understand that mentality.<br/>

I apologize if you took my post on the Girl Scouts thw wrong way...They were just not good leaders.<br/>

interesting debate......It's odd that most boxers on this list basically<br/>
oppose letterboxing being spread in print, but only to their friends. Even<br/>
more odd, is the fact that an article in Smithsonian Magazine brought it<br/>
here to the USA, and others I know that love the hobby and are great for it<br/>
read about it in Family Fun magazine, or other publications. So that kinda<br/>
baffles me. Seems selfish to wanna keep something all to yourself...but I<br/>
understand that folks worry about their boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I was interviewed for and article here in VA last year, and was sure to<br/>
mention to the interviewer, concerns that we may have and was given editing<br/>
rights. I included a clue to a box in it for the newbies to find. In it<br/>
was take home info about the hobby, and our concern. It was a tempoary box<br/>
and was pulled after 6 weeks. It only has 2 visitors and it was by boxers<br/>
that had been boxing for over 3 years and I knew. This was for me to guage<br/>
this kinda debate that newbies via articles in print are bad....My<br/>
conclusion: not true.<br/>
<br/>
Personally i think that Girl Scout Troops (not all...!) are worse for the<br/>
sport. I have found 2 boxes from girl scouts. One was a rusty tin can,<br/>
basically litter...with no stamp in it, and the other was a black trash<br/>
bag.....<br/>
<br/>
I have an open mind and always keep in mind that we are adults, acting<br/>
like kids, looking for stamps...nothing more....have fun.<br/>

&gt; Jesse, frankly many of us DON'T want Letterboxing spread around in <br/>
&gt; this way, so please don't add another article that attracts <br/>

&gt; articles don't bother to *really* learn about Letterboxing before <br/>
&gt; jumping in to go on this exciting-sounding "treasure hunt", often <br/>
&gt; jeopardizing our 'boxes. It is a game of stealth, and they usually <br/>

&gt; Please reconsider, and if you like the hobby so much, just introduce <br/>

What a conceded, stuck up snob you are.<br/>

Basically your whole post comes down to you not wanting "those kinds of<br/>
people." At least that is how I read it. But of course what am I to expect<br/>
from someone who sends poster boards to gatherings telling people how they<br/>
should play the game?<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand you folks complain that articles are written without ever<br/>
getting information from letterboxers themselves, but on the other hand,<br/>
when asked, you berate the reporter and tell them they should not write the<br/>
article, that it will attract the wrong type of people. Well, you are going<br/>
to have some give and take in anything, and I think these articles have<br/>
attracted lots of the right kinds of people too.<br/>
