do you think they would allow us to link to a webpage containing the test of the article, with proper credit to Julia.  We could add a link to the paper, if there is one...<br/>

I'll write Julia Cho and find out!  She send me a xerox of the article.  I <br/>
just did a search and the newspaper is online and her article can be read <br/>
at:<br/>
http://www.communityadvocate.com/html/northboro_articles_7.html<br/>
<br/>
Will write back after I hear from her.<br/>
