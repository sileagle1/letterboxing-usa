I think it is more a case of some HH  have different "rules"  Some have very<br/>
specific goals intended and the placers have asked that the  locations be<br/>
announced in order to move them along.  I am not overly familiar with Honor<br/>
Liberty, but am thinking she is one  that is trying to accomplish something<br/>
specific (a visit to all 50 states comes to mind, but I may be making that<br/>
up).<br/>

would like to read the list and comments for the first period see <br/>
archives post #34174, dated 10/03/2003. At times she gets bogged <br/>
down as some letterboxers are reluctant to post her location, since <br/>
it is against the normal procedures for a HH. Time is short as we <br/>
approach the end of her second year. We would like to have her sent <br/>
back to us prior to 9/11/2004 so that we might do a similar posting. <br/>

The creators of Honor Liberty (Don and Gwen) specifically instruct finders <br/>
to post the location of it on the list, so it's not a case of me choosing <br/>
to disregard the traditions regarding hitchhikers, but about the creators <br/>
having a different purpose for this particular hitchhiker.<br/>
