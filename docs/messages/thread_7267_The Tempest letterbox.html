The Tempest<br/>
Placed 16 August 2002<br/>
by "The Four Brothers"<br/>
Located in West Penwith, Cornwall, United Kingdom<br/>
Nearest town - Penzance<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Take a transatlantic flight to LHR, followed by the Heathrow Express to <br/>
Paddington Station, followed by the Cornish Riviera to the end of the line <br/>
(Penzance).  Find Pedn-men-an-mere on the South West Coast Path.<br/>
<br/>
At the National Trust sign for "Rospletha Cliffs", sight 150 degrees and <br/>
walk 57 paces to a concrete slab and a rusted iron structure (the remains of <br/>
a snooping station to find out what Marconi was doing on the Lizard).  From <br/>
the middle of the concrete slab, sight 120 degrees and walk 52 paces to a <br/>
cluster of large rocks. Underneath the face which looks at "the Logan Rock" <br/>
you will find The Tempest.<br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet since the area is well-travelled.  The box needs to be <br/>
securely wedged and stowed away in order to survive the mighty gales that <br/>
roar in from the Atlantic Ocean.<br/>

<p>When someone asked the other day if we would all be willing to pay a small fee to find a letter box, I think most of us assumed that it would just be a couple of dollars. After checking on the cost of a trans Atlantic flight, I think that that fee is just a hair over what I would be willing to pay at this time. Thanks for the post though.<br/></p></div>
