                    <div class="plaintext-content">Coool.... to read about the searching and good condition of... my <br/>
first one there.  Not too difficult to find.... and helps you deal <br/>
with the history of the place.    Look for the other three on OBX.... <br/>
they belong to a friend and youth organization colleague who has a <br/>
spirit of adventure not unlike my own.   Jamestown box will be <br/>
next.... if you like more history.   <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We were also down in the OBX last week.  During our exciting meeting <br/>
Team BeMa reminded me about the Flying OBX clues I had printed out. <br/>
If I had really read them before we headed for NC I would have <br/>
realized what was hidden less than 30 feet away when we visited that <br/>
historic site three hours before. <br/>
<br/>
When we finally did go back to get your box I have to admit one of <br/>
my party got a prickly pear cactus spine in her foot even with the <br/>
warning.  My 10 year old dd's "box pix" (we always take a photo at <br/>
the box site to stick into the old logbook) bears testiment to her <br/>
pain.  She had sneakers on too.  Nasty old things!<br/>
<br/>
Over the course of the week we were there we did find the other <br/>
three and actually had to rescue the Ocracoke box.  The logbook was <br/>
soaked and unreclaimable. <br/>
<br/>
These four stamps were the best souvenirs I got while down there.  <br/>
Its really awesome when a box reflects a special feature about the <br/>
area you find it in. We will watch eagerly for the Jamestown box!<br/>
