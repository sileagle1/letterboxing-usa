I agree with you that no one should feel obliged to hide boxes and that if<br/>
they do it from a sense of obligation they will probably not do as good a<br/>
job as someone who plants from a free desire to give back.  However, I still<br/>
say that until you've tried both sides of the equation, you can't have a<br/>
full perspective of the game.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn't make the lack of perspective a bad thing - that just means<br/>
someone hasn't gotten there yet.  I wouldn't have expected my daughter to<br/>
understand the beauty of motherhood when she was 12 years old, but I also<br/>
wouldn't have wanted her to rush to motherhood so she could have that<br/>
understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I think in many things we all do, we rush to get the whole experience.  Why<br/>
hurry?  Take your time and learn thoroughly at each step along the way.  And<br/>
learn well.  And after you master one level, move on to the next.  I think<br/>
this applies to letterboxing as well as anything else.  Ironically, I don't<br/>
think many of us, if any, will ever master the whole thing.  And that's one<br/>
reason why I keep on letterboxing, because I NEED something that will keep<br/>
me challenged and interested.<br/>
<br/>
However, I think that if a letterboxer takes the approach of "I'm just not<br/>
bent toward planting so I'm just going to be happy being a finder", they<br/>
shortchange themselves by closing the door on that aspect of experiencing<br/>
the game.  And they can be great finders for decades, but if they never take<br/>
the opportunity to try planting they will not ever have the full experience<br/>
of the game.  That doesn't mean they have to be stellar planters, or have<br/>
huge numbers of boxes out there, but it means they made an earnest attempt<br/>
to place a box, if for no other reason than to find out why a person who<br/>
loves to plant does what they do.<br/>

If someone doesn't get joy out of planting,t hey should not do it. So what, if some people <br/>
only like planting they are not being "fair" bc they won't go and find boxes? Ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
I am happy that this lady in my town [Kiddy Writer, if you know her] has been so warm and <br/>
encouraging about letterboxing, including by putting out many boxes that can be enjoyed <br/>
by beginners, and not demanding or requiring anything in return. She gets th efun out of <br/>
the carving and the selecting and the hiding and the writing. Her joy comes from me <br/>
sending her an excited email that "I found it!!!" and then telling her about the my journey.<br/>
<br/>
It was her warmth and acceptance that led me to want to plant a box. Just to say thank you <br/>
to her. So I did. Even though IMO the stamp was not that good since I am not much of a <br/>
carver. And then in conjunction with her we offered another letterbox last week in <br/>
conjunction with a food drive -- she carved the stamp and I offered a kick @ss logbook, if <br/>
I do say so myself. That was fun too.<br/>

my work is incredibly creative and challenging and technical, and my scrapbooking is the <br/>
same, and I am always doing challenging cross stitch projects too. For me personally [just <br/>
me] this is supposed to be my no stress, I'm not trying to be perfect at this, hobby. <br/>

While I appreciated the planted boxes out there for me to find before, I appreciate them <br/>
