<div>The hike to this letter box is easy, about 1/2 mile 
of boulder hopping and creek crossings to 
the foot of the falls (dogs OK).   
Note:  There is a requirement for an Adventure Pass but nobody checked us 
when we were there at mid week.</div>
<div>Directions:  From interstate 210 take the Lake Avenue exit north for 
approximately 3 miles.  Turn left (west) on Loma Alta Drive.  Drive 
about 1 mile to Chaney Trail at the flashing light .  Turn right on Chaney 
Trial and drive  1 1/2 miles (stay left at the fork) to Millard Campground, 
park in the parking lot, walk up the fire road past the outhouse and campground 
to the trail . <span id="__#Ath#SignaturePos__"></span> Work you way up 
the little canyon to the base of the falls and as you turn to leave the falls 
you will see 2 trees  (one with multi trunks).</div>
<div>.  In about 20 paces you will see another tree and then another 
skinnier tree in 20 paces.  Cross the creek and note the vertical red and 
white sign that says "no shortcutting".  Go to a tree with a large mass at 
the bottom approximately 16 paces north of the sign.  The tree has a large 
root that heads west down toward the creek.  Look under the root and under 
a rock hidden by moveable rocks for the letter box.  Be quick and careful 
as this area is very busy on weekends. </div></body></html>
