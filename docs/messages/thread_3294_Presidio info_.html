                    <div class="plaintext-content">I hunted for the Presidio boxes around Sept. 20th, but didn't have <br/>
much luck.  But I thought maybe I was not interpreting the clues <br/>
correctly, I plan to try again next time I am in the SFO area.<br/>
There is also the risk that these boxes were removed by the NPS, as <br/>
this is a National Park.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, If you are in SFO without a car,  the #28 bus will take <br/>
you to The Palace of Fine Arts and Exploratorium, from there, you can <br/>
enter Presidio Park and proceed to the Visitor's Center.  Inspiration <br/>
Point is located by the Presidio Golf Course, South from the <br/>
Visitor's Center.<br/>
<br/>
The clues are:<br/>
<br/>
Find the point where you're most likely to meet your muse. (Plenty of <br/>
space to leave your vehicle here.) 12 steps down, then follow the <br/>
pointer to the main trail.  At main trail, 30 degrees heading down to <br/>
a 4-way.  Straight down to the spring.  Hence, 133 degrees up the <br/>
steps.  When terrain opens up, and you spot sand to the right, head <br/>
East.  Continue on main trail, up into the woods, eastwardly, all the <br/>
way up to the west ocean.  Follow it to the left to the eight <br/>
whites.  Follow the lights at 300 degrees until the bearing changes.  <br/>
This is a good place to take a seat, don't get your feet wet though.<br/>
<br/>
Meet the first twin at 65 paces 127 degrees.  From  the second twin, <br/>
115 at 87 to a lone tree.  From middle of trail on North side of said <br/>
tree, heading 80 degrees, what you seek rests among some roots about <br/>
halfway up the hill.<br/>
<br/>
After replacing everything well, go back to where you could have <br/>
taken a seat.  Continue at 280, across the road, and curve left to <br/>
Funston.  Head generally south to the gate at the end of the road.  <br/>
Head up the trail, still mostly south.  Keep climbing and follow the <br/>
trail until you return to a spot you've been before.  Oops, you went <br/>
too far.  Back whence you came (West) 250 paces, past the big turn to <br/>
a little trail down to your right. 70 paces to somewhat of a <br/>
"clearing".  From the foot of the largest sleeping giant, sight the <br/>
gatekeeper at 330 degrees.  You'll find the gate 13 paces at 320 <br/>
degrees from its keeper.  Your second treasure lies buried on the <br/>
North side of gate under some bark.<br/>
<br/>
Again, pack and hide well for the next seeker. Your vehicle can be <br/>
found if you retrace your steps to where you retraced your steps and <br/>
head up.<br/>
