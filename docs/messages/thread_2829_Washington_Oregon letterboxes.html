                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just took a road trip through Washington,<br/>
Oregon, Wyoming, and Idaho. We brought clues<br/>
to a handful of letterboxes in the area, hoping<br/>
to get as many as we could on our trip.<br/>
Unfortunately, we tried to fit too much into our<br/>
limited schedule on the first part of the trip, and<br/>
then had car trouble, so it turned out we only<br/>
found one letterbox - the Devil's Lake box near<br/>
Lincoln City, Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
It was a nice easy letterbox, the clues were clear<br/>
and accurate. The box itself was quite soggy,<br/>
both inside and out, but the zipper baggie inside<br/>
kept the contents dry.  It's either a new book,<br/>
or we were the first to locate the Devil's Lake<br/>
box! We stamped up and then dried the box as<br/>
well as we could before replacing it, but it was<br/>
clear the box wasn't weather-tight. I plan to use<br/>
the same types of boxes, but don't have a problem<br/>
with wet in my area.<br/>
<br/>
We also planned to get the Ft. Canby boxes near<br/>
Ilwaco, Washington, but ran into a couple snags.<br/>
At the North Head Lighthouse, clues were a bit<br/>
confusing, as there were two benches on the<br/>
trail. We took what looked like "an immediate<br/>
path to the right" of the first bench past the keeper's<br/>
<br/>
house, but it turned out not to be a path at all, but<br/>
a deer trail, as we later found. After some initial<br/>
confusion, we took the paved walkway with a<br/>
few stairs located up the trail 150+ feet or so,<br/>
nearer to the second bench, but before it. Then<br/>
we saw "Big Bonsai", so finally figured that<br/>
was it. This area was profusely overgrown with<br/>
brush and tall grass, which made it difficult to<br/>
locate anything specific once a compass reading<br/>
was made. Further hampering our efforts, but<br/>
making it more enjoyable, we came face to face<br/>
with (nearly stumbled over) a deer, who had set<br/>
up housekeeping - probably on the exact spot the<br/>
box may also have been hiding. She was quite<br/>
reluctant to give up her spot - maybe she had<br/>
a fawn nearby. We left our gloves at the hotel,<br/>
so that made it impossible to lift up any branches<br/>
on those extremely prickly pines. I'm sure it<br/>
was there somewhere, but we left empty handed.<br/>
I would love to see a picture of the stamp if<br/>
anyone has posted a digital image of it. Anyhow,<br/>
it was a great view, so we were glad we stopped<br/>
there - we probably would not have otherwise.<br/>
By that time, we had run out of time to stop at<br/>
the Cape Disappointment Lighthouse.<br/>
<br/>
We may be back up in that area again soon,<br/>
and I'm going to leave plenty of time for<br/>
letterboxing this time. All in all, a wonderful<br/>
week spent in the Pacific northwest. We<br/>
were promised some rain, but it was completely<br/>
dry and sunny all week. Even the Olympic<br/>
rainforest was dry.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to Amanda and John for hosting<br/>
these boxes. Since we didn't have a lot of time,<br/>
and I'm still somewhat limited in my mobility,<br/>
the "easy" boxes are the perfect way to see some<br/>
great sights and stretch our legs on our road<br/>
trip along the coast.<br/>
<br/>
We also planned to get Mitch's Raptor box in Idaho<br/>
and/or the Green River Wyoming box (on our way<br/>
back to Colorado), but our battery died, so we<br/>
ended up spending a couple hours in Utah at a<br/>
Pep Boys instead. Oh well, again - next time.<br/>
