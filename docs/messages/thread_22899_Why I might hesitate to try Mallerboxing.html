                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I was in college, I worked in a department store selling perfume.  Our security guards were a slightly overzealous, and generally bored group of guys.  I should mention that our store was in the *formerly* posh downtown shopping district in Baltimore.  I was dismayed at how many homeless people came in every day and literally took baths in the sample perfume.  Working there was eye opening for this little girl from the 'burbs.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if anybody seemed to be shoplifting (and there was a *lot* of that going on), our security guys tooks the flying tackle approach to catching the thieves.  They didn't to care of they inflicted a lot of damge on either shoplifter or shop.  I have vivid memories of the head of security tackling a man, and sending them both crashing through the glass case of one of the other cosmetic counters.   This was probably the high point of the month for our security team.  I'm certain that whatever might have been in the pockets of the would-be shoplifter in no way equalled the monetary damage done to the store by its own employees.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing all that glass shattering, sure made me never ever, ever, ever want to look furtive in any store......ever.<br/>
<br/>
So, I think I won't be signing up for Mallerboxing anytime soon.  Besides, I would rather be out in the weather, in my clompy shoes, with the bugs and the scat, than hanging around in a mall.<br/>
<br/>
But that's just my weird opinion.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Me too!  I have very fond memories of Kitzbhl--spent several winter <br/>
vacations (5 or 6?) there while attending, of all things, winter <br/>
swimming camp in nearby Mittersill.  We also spent our summer training <br/>
sessions there but the snow skiing wasn't as good then but the outdoor <br/>
swimming pools were warmer.  ;)  <br/>

Kitzbhl to us (expats at the time) is sort of like Truckee is to <br/>
Northern Californians...<br/>
