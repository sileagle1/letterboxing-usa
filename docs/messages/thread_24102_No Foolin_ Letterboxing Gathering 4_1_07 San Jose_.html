broadcast announcement with updates!<br/>
<br/>
We already have more than 40 folks signed up to attend!! <br/>
<br/>
Successfully recruited several travelling event stamps (and the <br/>
groveling has just begun!).  <br/>
<br/>
Rumor has it some of our attendees are carving new stamps for this <br/>
event, but I don't want to leak names just yet.....but these will <br/>
undoubtedly be lovely stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
Our primary event stamp is not handcarved (GASP!) but it is a custom <br/>
design that we sent off to Simon's Stamps for production. I am told <br/>
by a knowledgable source that our custom letterbox stamps are <br/>
similar in style to those at Dartmoor--witty, arty, lots of <br/>
lettering.  I don't think it will disappoint.<br/>
<br/>
Food provided (just bring a dessert to share), lots of good <br/>
letterboxes nearby, playground adjacent to our covered picnic area, <br/>
wheelchair accessible--all in sunny San Jose.  Free parking.  No <br/>
dogs.  <br/>
<br/>
Please check out our listing and consider making the drive!  Should <br/>
be a fun day of letterboxes with some surprises.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
