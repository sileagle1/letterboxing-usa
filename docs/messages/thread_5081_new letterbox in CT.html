Bailey Trail North -Hammonasset River Tral, Buck Hill Loop-A Madison Land Conservation Trust  blue dot trail about 1 and 1/2 miles to find two letterboxes- The Buck Hill scenic overlook and the Cube Rock letterbox takes about 1hr. depending on pace.<br/>
<br/>
<u>Buck Hill Loop Letterbox</u>.  From I-95 take exit 59, Rt. 79 north in Madison. Proceed north roughly 3 miles to the blinking light and turn right imediately  onto Chestnut Hill Rd. Take first left, Summer Hill Rd. which runs parallel to the Hammonasset R. After approx. 1 and 1/2 miles turn right onto Heatherwood. Its the first right on Summer Hill. Follow to its end and turn left  onto Concord and then right onto Georgetown Circle and park. (not by the no parking sign although thats where the trail begins) At the first juncture, just a little way in turn left and head over the swamp boardwalk following the river north. After a while youll see a large rock cliff behind a home off to your left and the trail begins to climb.  Where the trail splits take the left straight up hill. This begins the Buck Hill Loop which is very steep but relatively short. The house is now below you and there will be another house at the very top of the hill to your right and back as you face Long Island Sound. After you stand on the ledge admiring the view proceed down hill about 20 paces to a jagged overhang of rock ledge with a cedar tree and a stump of a tree just below the rock.  Check under the overhang for the Buck Hill letterbox and sign in. <br/>
<br/>
<u>Cube Rock letterbox on Bailey Trail North</u>. After finding Buck Hill continue on the Buck Hill Loop. The trail continues north but begins to descend more gradually than on the way up. You will see the river in some spots and a house or two. Property lines may come close, be careful. Continue on until the loop connects to the main trail and take a right. Following the river south now and to your left. Soon youll come to a large pool with a wooden platform on the eastern bank.  On your right a short way up the hill is a huge cube shaped bolder. The box is hidden under the left side  of the bolder along the base in about the 3rd large crevice back from the front overhang. Continue on trail back to the car.<br/>
<br/>
This trail system can also be accessed from Rt. 80 about 2 miles east of  the Nth. Madison traffic circle or intersection of Rts 80 and 79. Park by the bridge and trail begins at the blue dot on the south side of Rt. 80.  If you cross the bridge into Killingworth youve gone too far. The hike can be done in the reverse if you wish.<br/>
Turn  right on the Buck Hill Loop until you come to the ledgy summit and view of L. I. Sound. Descent will be very steep this way and turn left to find Cube Rock. Keep moving north, river on your right, back to the car.  Keep your eyes open for future add-on letterboxes to the Bailey trail.
