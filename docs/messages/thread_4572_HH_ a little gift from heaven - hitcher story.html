    This past Saturday afternoon, while still trying to recover from <br/>
the flu and a few toxic attitudes, Pete and I were taking a gentle <br/>
stroll in Hurd State Park,CT, to look for Karen Thomsen's wonderful <br/>
new boxes.  High above the Connecticut River we sat, communing with <br/>
nature and contemplating upon life's vagaries, when suddenly out of <br/>
nowhere, above the rock cliff in front of us appeared a lovely smiling <br/>
face seemingly surrounded by a glowing golden halo, saying, "Wanda, <br/>
how are you?"  Caught off guard, I started babbling something <br/>
incoherent about not feeling so well, and then realized that the <br/>
golden haired apparition before me was none other than Elizabeth <br/>
Tripp, known to letterboxing circles as Bikerbabie (and for her <br/>
Thoreau quote "I went to the woods to live deliberately..."}<br/>
"These things take time to get over," she said, and added that she was <br/>
out doing some off-trail geocaching with a friend and had just <br/>
stumbled upon the hitcher Churchill sitting out alone in the middle of <br/>
the forest!  "Here," she said, "you take it to the MA Gathering <br/>
tomorrow , and say 'hi' to Alan for me."  <br/>
<br/>
So, that's just what we did! Several folks were glad to share in the <br/>
fun of stamping in, including some for whom it was their very first <br/>
hitcher!  And now Churchill sits secretly back in the woods with a new <br/>
host box friend, patiently awaiting his next visitors.  But for us, he <br/>
will always be EXTRA special, not only for the incredible and gracious <br/>
way he appeared out of nowhere - like a gift from heaven- but also <br/>
because that just happened to be the very box that gave us PFX 1000!<br/>
Thanks again, Elizabeth, for being such an angel!<br/>
