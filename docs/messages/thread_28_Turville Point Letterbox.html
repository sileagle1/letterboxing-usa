&gt; I think I had the clues out of order before<br/>
&gt;  on this new letterbox.<br/>
&gt;  I hope I fix it.  How do they read now?...<br/>
&gt;  Dan'l<br/>
<br/>
Looks FANTASTIC, Dan'l!<br/>
This is so thrilling ~ thanks so much for putting it up!<br/>
I had hoped that we would have a chance to test the clues<br/>
today, but too busy .... maybe tomorrow. I think this qualifies<br/>
as an easy one, though...<br/>
The map is great fun ~ if you look at the lake Turville Point is<br/>
on, the tiny river leading from the lake and under the highway<br/>
is right where the Castle Park is in Monona (north of the highway) ~<br/>
we live a bit of a ways east of that.<br/>
The grey line that separates Monona Bay from the lake is<br/>
a road ~ and to the left of that road alongside the lake is the bike<br/>
path. The square with the grid of streets around it in the isthmus is<br/>
the Capitol. The map is too too cool!<br/>
I can attempt to send a pic of the image as an attachment, if you<br/>
have room to include it, but it's iffy because I'd have to figure out<br/>
how to send an attachment first! LMK...<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
Deborah <br/>
(P.S. ~ Melanie the 3 yr old is gonna be into maps! She was sitting<br/>
here next to me watching Peter Pan and suddenly announced ~<br/>
"Mom! Why are you looking at that map!" LOL ~ she knows what<br/>
they are because of our first driving vacation with her this summer ~<br/>
she was fond of looking at the road maps and asking "where are we?")<br/>

Sending an attachment is easy if you have a scan of the picture on your<br/>
computer or on a disk.  Do you?  If so, I can tell you how to attach it<br/>
to an e-mail.  If not, you would have to go to a copy place or some<br/>
such place as does computer scans (maybe your work?) and have it <br/>
scanned first.<br/>

Good for Melanie!  Can she actually work with a map at 3?  What<br/>
level of map would she need if she could work with one?<br/>
