THE WEDDING ROCK<br/>
<br/>
The Story:<br/>
The year : 1646<br/>
It was a snowy winter, and now, for all to read, is a memorial to the <br/>
Wedding of Jonathan<br/>
Rudd and his bride.<br/>
Unable to travel to a church because of deep snow, it was decided to <br/>
meet by a Brooke<br/>
for the ceremony. At that time, this was the boundary line of the two <br/>
colonies of<br/>
Saybrook and Pequot. Read their story on the rock and follow clues to <br/>
the Wedding Rock<br/>
Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Clues: The large rock sits at 41.19 degrees and about 72.14+ degrees [ <br/>
give or take as no<br/>
G.P.S was used , the rock can be seen from the road ] The large bronze <br/>
plaque tells a<br/>
most interesting story. Park carefully and from the western side of the <br/>
Rock, walk about<br/>
15 steps, passing by a multi family squirrel hotel and a three trunked tree.<br/>
Stamp in and please re hide well. The squirrels are curious.!!<br/>
For History Buffs, Google ~~ Jonathan Rudd for a most interesting and <br/>
colorful history. !<br/>
Enjoy<br/>
