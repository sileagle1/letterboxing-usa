Assawoman letterboxes on Sunday. These letterboxes were planted <br/>
11/2000 by Squirrel. We were the first to find them! The clues were <br/>
excellent and the boxes are in good shape. They were in a gorgeous <br/>
location. From the tower we saw a bald eagle caughting his lunch. <br/>
Great day to be outside.<br/>
<br/>
We also found Prince of Power in Pocomoke SP (Eastern Shore of <br/>
Maryland). The box was in very good condition. The box was placed <br/>
10/2000 and we were the third stamp. We will be going back to this <br/>
park with our kayaks to enjoy the water!<br/>

tower box, but we managed.  There's a dead SNAKE nearby!  Also this <br/>
FYI:  We've been going to the Bethany-Dewey-Rehoboth beach scene for <br/>
more than 20-years and Assawoman Wildlife Management area is a <br/>
wonderful discovery.  The view from atop the tower is magnificant.  <br/>
If you go, bring your camera because it is Kodak picture perfect. <br/>
Txs, Squirrel! <br/>
