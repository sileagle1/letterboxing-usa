I'm sure we could all talk your ear off. How about you name a time <br/>
and day and we can try the Yahoo chatroom attached to this group?<br/>
<br/>
Dowsing! I hadn't thought of it, but now will have to give it a go.  <br/>
But should I stumble through the woods with a forked applewood branch <br/>
(may only find water...)? or perhaps I should start with a pendelum <br/>
over the topo map... certainly would get fewer strange looks from <br/>
other hikers that way. :)<br/>
<br/>
Is the dowsing question related to your article, or are you into <br/>
dowsing &amp; diviniation as personal interest?<br/>

for information on letterboxing.  All sorts of issues are discussed, with<br/>
suggestions pouring in from everywhere on any number of subjects.  Often<br/>
when I've been away for awhile there are zillions of messages (remember when<br/>
we were spammed by the geocachers? or the debate about displaying found<br/>
stamps on personal websites?).  People come up with good ideas like<br/>
designating the difficulty of trails and estimating distances and times<br/>
various hikes might take so one knows if it will be safe to bring children<br/>
along, thoughts about placement of boxes and clues that still work in the<br/>
dead of winter with 2 - 3 feet of snow and why including a doggie biscuit<br/>
isn't such a great idea.  Scroll through and you will find a wealth of<br/>
information on things that work (and things that don't!)   Good luck on your<br/>
article.  Ann T.<br/>

&gt;box without the clue in hand) for the boxes before! Never worked out for<br/>
&gt;some reason though. Always good to have the clue around to help you. I'd<br/>
&gt;love to chat with you about Letterboxing! However, what you might want to do<br/>
&gt;is go to Rutland and stop into the outfitter store called The Great<br/>
&gt;Outdoors. There's someone there that could help you out with any information<br/>
&gt;as well!<br/>

Thanks! Next time I'm in Rutland I'll try that.<br/>

Dear Bob,<br/>
<br/>
When you're out hiking, looking for a place to plant a letterbox, what<br/>
kinds of places catch your eye? How do you try to ensure that the l.b.<br/>
won't be lost, or too easily found? And in searching, what skills do you<br/>
find yourself using, or developing? Is there a letterboxing "eye"?<br/>

&gt; Dear Bob,<br/>
&gt; <br/>

what<br/>
&gt; kinds of places catch your eye? How do you try to ensure that the <br/>
l.b.<br/>
&gt; won't be lost, or too easily found? And in searching, what skills <br/>

Hi Tim,<br/>
    You've asked some good questions, but I'll bet my answers will <br/>
only reflect the common experience among letterboxers, new and old.<br/>
    It's just like when I'm out on someone else's trail, and I can't <br/>
help myself from doing a little clearing along the way - from long <br/>
habit and necessity on those for which I have some responsibility <br/>
(the Finger Lakes Trail, for instance).  For the last year that I've <br/>
been involved in this intriguing activity, it seems I've been almost <br/>
constantly noting: "That would be a dandy place right there !". Guess <br/>
I've always been fond of rocky outcrops, so they always attract my <br/>
eye.  Hollow trees, old building foundations . . .  places that offer <br/>
some cover from the roving eye and promise to be at least semi-<br/>
permanent seem at once to be candidates.<br/>
    "Insuring that it won't be lost" has just become a paramount <br/>
consideration, as I've just discovered an early effort (which <br/>
fortunately hadn't yet been published) had been filched.  I see now <br/>
that there was just too much incidental traffic nearby and that <br/>
approach from a particular direction allowed accidental detection. I <br/>
guess it's all right to allow a bit of the box to be visible, but <br/>
only if it's seriously being looked for by those having the clues.<br/>
    I'm sure, therefore, that one does develop a "letterboxing eye" <br/>
with experience.  One goes through a mental checklist:  will this be <br/>
ok with the landowner (or park authority)? . .  will it be safe from <br/>
accidental discovery? . .  is it an all-season location? . . where <br/>
should the starting point be? . . what can be used for a "handrail" <br/>
(orienteering jargon for a hint that you're off-track or have gone <br/>
too far)? . . does this location have additional interest for the <br/>
letterboxer (or his family)? . . should it be made easy or difficult <br/>
to find?  These are only some of the considerations.<br/>
    My particular emphasis, shared with many others such as Tom Cooch <br/>
and StGeorge, is that the letterboxing experience should not just be <br/>
looking for a sandwich box in the woods, but should be in a place of <br/>
special - and possibly redeeming (in case of failure-to-find) - <br/>
interest . . . scenic, historical, architectural, whatever.  So, not <br/>
only the clues should be given, but enough background information on <br/>
the locale should be provided to invite and to help inform those on <br/>
the quest for their enhanced pleasure.<br/>
    Hope this helps.  With the enthusiasm building, I could write my <br/>
own article.<br/>
