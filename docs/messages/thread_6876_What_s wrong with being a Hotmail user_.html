<br/>
"Should the list settings be changed to<br/>
moderate the first post from a new<br/>
subscriber?<br/>
<br/>
(pros: mitigate a certain class of<br/>
low-volume spam, hotmail creators,<br/>
"vomit posters"; cons: more work, more<br/>
"members only vibe", moderator has to<br/>
judge whether something is a joke or<br/>
game-related content) "<br/>
<br/>
......there's something I need to understand.  What makes we Hotmail users <br/>
liable to "mitigation?"   I admit to being fairly ignorant of many aspects <br/>
of computers and the internet.  But I HAVE to use Web-based email, since I'm <br/>
in the boonies - no local access # for AOL, etc. - and I travel a lot.<br/>
<br/>
So what happens to me if the majority votes yes?<br/>
<br/>
I had to change from MountainScorpia to Volksboxer cuz for the life of me I <br/>
couldn't switch to digest, so I stopped using it and signed up for digest <br/>
mode as Volksboxer.<br/>
