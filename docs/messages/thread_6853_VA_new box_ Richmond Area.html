Letterbox name: Rockwood Park Letterbox<br/>
Difficulty:Easy, less than 1 1/2 miles round trip<br/>
Date placed: Aug. 10, 2002<br/>
State:Virginia<br/>
County:Chesterfield, nearest city is Richmond<br/>
<br/>
Driving directions:Rockwood Park is in Chesterfield County, a few miles south of Richmond near the intersection of Courthouse Road and Hull Street.<br/>
(From Richmond, take the Powhite Parkway south to Courthouse and go south on Courthouse.)<br/>
<br/>
As you drive in to the park at the Courthouse Road entrance, turn left at the T-intersection. You will pass several ball fields on the left and right. Turn left into a parking lot when you see the sign directing you to the<br/>
Nature Center and nature trails.<br/>
<br/>
1.  After you have visited the log-cabin-style Rockwood Nature Center (open 12-5 on weekends, has cool snake and wildlife exhibits inside), take the paved trail that starts behind and to the left of the center.<br/>
2.  Soon you will emerge from the woods as you pass a gate. You will see the GARDEN PLOTS straight ahead in the sun, but you want to veer right, staying on the main paved path, to re-enter the woods through another gate.<br/>
3.  You will soon pass Picnic Shelter #3 on your left. Keep going!<br/>
4.  Immediately after the picnic shelter, a dirt path goes left. Take this path. See that tree straight ahead as you step onto this path? It has an orange dot spray-painted on it.<br/>
5.  Pass the ICE PIT on your right.<br/>
6. Cross the wooden walkway and take the dirt path to your left.<br/>
7.  Ooooh! Look at the jumbles of rocks on your right! They're interesting, but you should keep on going forward.<br/>
8.  At the fork in the path, go left.<br/>
9. Step over the tree that has fallen on the trail and keep going.<br/>
10. See that rustic wooden bench over on the right? You are almost there!<br/>
11. Don't cross the wooden bridge in front of you--step to the right of it and go down to the first upright support. The box is wedged under the walkway, up and to the left of the support.<br/>
<br/>
Be discreet as there are many walkers and joggers here. Hide the box well when you are finished.<br/>
<br/>
To leave, cross the wooden bridge and when you get to a T-intersection on another wooden walkway, go right to get back on the paved path. To complete the loop of the park, go left on the paved path back to the parking lot.<br/>
