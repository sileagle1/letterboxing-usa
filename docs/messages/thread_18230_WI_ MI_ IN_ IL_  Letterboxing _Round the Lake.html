Lakes area.  Unfortunately not everyone lives in an area where it <br/>
would be feasible to participate in this venture, but for those of <br/>
you who do, I hope you will consider it.<br/>
<br/>
So what is this Letterboxing 'Round the Lake series all about? Well<br/>
no doubt many of you have heard of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour? It<br/>
is an established road trip route that takes a person all of the way<br/>
around Lake Michigan, through WI, MI, IN and IL. This series would<br/>
seek to populate that route with letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
I won't go into great detail here in the post, but you can check out<br/>
all of the specifics in the file I uploaded to the files section.<br/>
The short is that I am looking for participants who would like to<br/>
participate in the project by contributing a letterbox -- you make<br/>
it, you place it, you write the clues and post them where you wish,<br/>
you maintain the box and clues. I will then create a central web<br/>
page with links to all of the clues and approach the MI and WI<br/>
tourist associations in hopes they might feature it as a fun<br/>
diversion along the tour. Who knows, we may gain some new<br/>
letterboxers!<br/>
<br/>
Want to know more?<br/>
