                    <div class="plaintext-content">I will be searching for a couple of the Austin and Harker Heights <br/>
boxes in the next few days and weeks.  So I'll report back if I find <br/>

(Barton Greenbelt and Mt. Bonnel) were placed a while back, so I'm <br/>
hoping they are still there.  The Harker Heights boxes appear to have <br/>
been placed more recently so I expect that they are still there.<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to letterboxing (I carved my signature stamp last night) and <br/>
I'm very excited about this hobby/sport/art.  I already have an idea <br/>
for a series of letterboxes that I hope to plant in the next few <br/>
months.<br/>

We were a couple days behind you in finding the 2 Barton Creek Green <br/>
Belt boxes.  They were our first and second letterboxes!!!!  It was a <br/>
beautiful sunny day in the 60's and there was actually water running <br/>
in the creek.  A nice change from summertime drought season!<br/>
<br/>
I'm thrilled that you have placed a new box in Zilker Park.  On our <br/>
next foray out we are going to do the Mt. Bonnel box and now your <br/>
Zilker Park box.  I look forward to collecting all your 6 Flags of <br/>
Texas stamps.  Thanks for the adventure!!!<br/>
