&gt; little 'boxing while in the area.  Since then I have been contacted<br/>
&gt; by the NYC police, the transit authority at Grand Central Station<br/>
&gt; (not even a box there that I know of) and just last week received a<br/>
&gt; call from the FBI (honest).<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering how long it would be before a letterboxer was confused with a terrorist.  : )  Now we just have to wait for the first letterboxer to be detained for questioning.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes worry that someone will think I am casing someplace when I am out benchmark hunting with my GPS, especially since some of them on bridge abutments or in front of official structures such as harbor departments, city halls and docks or are easily found landmarks (tall buildings, water towers, etc.).<br/>
