Hey all!  I've just finished scoping out and writing a 4-page poem of<br/>
clues to a pair of letterboxes I plan to place here in Cleveland.  Now<br/>
I'm on to creating the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I made my design for the stamp on my computer, and bought a block of<br/>
"Mastercarve" to work with.  Now I'm trying to figure out how to get<br/>
the printed image onto the rubber for carving. I've read about going<br/>
over the printout with a pencil and tracing paper, but there's got to<br/>
be a more direct method of getting ink-jet printed artwork onto the<br/>
rubber, right?  If I could draw that well with a pencil, I wouldn't<br/>
have used the computer to create the artwork. :D<br/>
<br/>
Any tips would be appreciated!<br/>

I find this method to work the best for myself.<br/>
It also works equally well with the speedy stamp (pink stuff-firmer)<br/>
as well as the Staedler Mars Mastercarve (white- soft stuff)<br/>
<br/>
1. Draw stamp image<br/>
2. Scan and make adjustments (darker-more contrast)<br/>
3. Print using LASER PRINTER<br/>
4. Lay printed paper image side down on the rubber surface.<br/>
5. Apply hot iron for 3-5 seconds to the paper to transfer the printed<br/>
ink from the paper. Let the rubber cool for a few minutes prior to<br/>
carving. Some carvers even place in fridge to harden the rubber.<br/>
<br/>
There are many online tutorials, as well as master carvers on this<br/>
list - everyone please feel free to elaborate on your own technique.<br/>
You can always do the pencil rubbing transfer, but I find that letters<br/>
get muddled by the time you go to carve and the pencil smudges.<br/>

I can't say it is the best or folks will show up outside with pitchforks and torches, but what <br/>
I like to use is the blender pen method. To research the various methods of transfer, a <br/>
good stop would be at Silent Doug's mighty list o' links.<br/>

Then I put it face down on the rubber and with a warm iron - no steam - I press the image onto the rubber until it transfers.  I pull the corner up a few times to see when it's dark enough.  I get the clearest image using this method.  You need to be careful not to set the iron too hot because if it's too hot, the rubber will melt.<br/>

Best is what works best for you.  <br/>
<br/>
I like the imperfect transfer of the pencil method because it <br/>
introduces a little of your own artistry into the process.  I like <br/>
the look of lines that aren't completely straight, images that don't <br/>
look like photos.  (Not that I don't like the fabulous images that <br/>
do.)<br/>
<br/>
I can't draw either so I copy, size, and print some image, either <br/>
from Google images, or digital photos.  Then I trace/draw directly <br/>
over the image in pencil.  At this stage I am making a lot of <br/>
decisions and choices as to what lines to use.  Then I rub transfer <br/>
it onto the rubber.  <br/>
<br/>
For better or ill it is transformed from a photo to an <br/>
illustration.  <br/>
