Lake Somerville is located just north of Brenham, Texas.  The lake <br/>
offers camping, fishing, horse and hiking trails.  Facilities include <br/>
showers, boat ramp, fishing pier, and horse corrals.  There are 2 <br/>
state parks on the lake, Nails Creek Unit and Birch Creek Unit.  <br/>
Brenham is a great town to stroll around, and the surrounding area is <br/>
beautiful in the spring when the bluebonnets bloom.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
The "Somer Fly" letterbox is located in the Birch Creek Unit of Lake <br/>
Somerville State Park, northwest of Brehman.  From Brenham, take Hwy <br/>
36 toward Waco.  Just past Lyons, turn left on FM 60.  Then turn left <br/>
on Park Road 57, and go to the park trailer and pay your entry fee.  <br/>
Also, pick up a park map.  Follow the map to the Old Hickory Camping <br/>
area, and park near campsite 71 and 69.  <br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
The trail is located between campsites 71 and 69.  From the "Lake <br/>
Trail" sign, go east on this trail toward the lake for 40 paces to a <br/>
cedar tree on the left edge of the trail.  Turn left, facing 60 <br/>
degrees, and follow a side path(which is just before the cedar tree) <br/>
in that direction.  Go 14 paces to another cedar tree on your right <br/>
(east).  East of this tree, about 3 yards from it's east side, is a <br/>
tree stump.  The box is hidden under leaves and sticks on the stump's <br/>
east side.<br/>
<br/>
Now go enjoy the rest of the park.  (I would have hidden this farther <br/>
down the lake trail, but the lake was actually covering the trail at <br/>
the time I visited).<br/>

Well I'll be.  My great-great Grandfather was the Nailhead that that <br/>
creek was named after! Should I ever get down Tejas way, I'll make a <br/>
point of searchin it out.  Been thru that area lots of times as a <br/>
boy.  Spent most of my time closer to Meridian and the Bosque River <br/>
than the Brazos tho.  Small world.<br/>
