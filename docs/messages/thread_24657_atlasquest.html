It was by no means your standard squirrel. Upon seeing me, it hopped up<br/>

*******************************<br/>
<br/>
So - I have to ask, if you actually see the squirrel again, and you can get<br/>
close enough to it and its accordion to log it, would you log it using<br/>
pigment or dye, or do you think you could hold onto it long enough to use<br/>
markers???<br/>
<br/>
OR - were you talking hardwood or evergreen logs?<br/>

While guilty of sarcastic responses over on AQ, I try hard to reserve <br/>
those for folks who I know/or kinda sorta "get" me or who PREtend to.<br/>
<br/>
The answer to your question here is:  No, that's not typical on AQ a <br/>
very friendly place.<br/>
<br/>
The issue was your question itself and how it was phrased.  I mean no <br/>
offense, but it was basically, unanswerable.<br/>
<br/>
When you get to understand what "unlisted" means, you will probably <br/>
understand better.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello, still new here.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I posted an inquiry on the Atlas Quest Board and all I got back <br/>
was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; sarcastic remark. Is that typical of the Atlas Quest Board?<br/>

You got caught in a "statistical misinterpretation". ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And that's all I've got to say about that.<br/>
<br/>
As far as sarcastic responses, many people forget that e-mail doesn't<br/>
carry tone of voice or facial expressions well so messages get taken<br/>
the wrong way. I've been guilty of the occasional flippant response<br/>
but I try to limit that to the people who know me. Sometimes you just<br/>
have to shrug it off.<br/>
