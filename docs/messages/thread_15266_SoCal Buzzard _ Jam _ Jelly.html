                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the "Brutal" words. You can give Ryan a big thank you for the plaque code as we copied his SLO Walking Tour. I think Buzzard hit it right on as we couldn't think of a better place to spend a warm summer day in SoCal than at the beach. The number of Irish Pubs in this little town makes for hazardous conditions on St. Paddy's Day.  We hit the Pasadena shelter on the way back to Kernville and we were first in. The mournful howls were tugging at our hearts. We checked the Real 49er about 2 weeks ago and saw J&amp;J 's stamps. There were only 5 stampins posted so the ratio is about 7 to 1 as compared to the other LB State letterboxes. If you are looking for the oldest letterbox in Calif. go for the Circle X box in Thousand Oaks. It was planted by Lone Wolf on a trip to Calif. 3/4/99. I have probably started a convoy to Thousand Oaks this weekend!  Don<br/>
