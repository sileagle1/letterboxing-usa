across another letterbox planted on quite a different day.  <br/>
Surrounded by autumn leaves not completely turned their vibrant fall <br/>
colors, and temperatures much warmer than expected for mid-October, <br/>
and while enjoying a visit from friend and letterboxer, "RI Wizard", <br/>
a letterbox was planted on the Buck Hollow trail.  The box was one of <br/>
a pair planned for the Buck Hollow/Buck Ridge trail.  Unfortunately, <br/>
before the second was planted, the Shenandoah forest fire closed off <br/>
that section of the Park.  Not wanting to send anyone off on a <br/>
fruitless hunt, I continued to hold back the clues awaiting an <br/>
opportunity to check on the condition of the box. Along comes the <br/>
Jolly G-Man on a cold and snowy day and plants one on the Buck Hollow <br/>
Trail.  So, heed his good advice...post those clues promptly!<br/>
<br/>
Better late than never, here's the clues to another on the Buck <br/>
Hollow trail.<br/>
<br/>
We began the hike at the 33.5 mile of the Skyline Drive, at the south <br/>
end of the Meadow Spring parking area.  The Buck Hollow trail to the <br/>
left starts its descent there.  We crossed the stream twice before <br/>
crossing it again oaver several levels of rocks.  At about 2 miles, <br/>
the considerably steep descent seemed to level off at a narrow <br/>
overlook to the stream.  On that flat section of trail, with your <br/>
back to the blue-blazed tree, take a heading of 130 to a cluster of <br/>
six trees.  There you'll find two boulders side by side, meeting each <br/>
other at the top.  Tucked into the space between, and hidden by <br/>
stones on three sides, is the Buck Hollow Letterbox.  Stamp in and <br/>
replace the stones carefully to protect the hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
The Buck Hollow/Buck Ridge trail, a 5.6 mile loop, is described in <br/>
the Falcon Guide book as moderately strenuous.  Hikers not used to <br/>
steep climbs might find it a bit more difficult.  It's worth every <br/>
step though!<br/>
