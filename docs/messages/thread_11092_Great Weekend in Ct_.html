(special thanks to the Needeeps for hiking them for us to make sure <br/>
the directions were OK) and we did a little letterboxing ourself.  <br/>
Today was a busy day with church so tomorrow I'll put the rest of the <br/>
boxes on the message board.  They are off of Rt 171 also.  The boxes <br/>
we did was the Trailwood's Back Door.  Great series Chuck, Molly, &amp; <br/>
Chickabirdie and The Pony Express.  Pick up the Princess Diaries <br/>
Hitch Hicker in Hampton(Let my brother do the One Honory Cowboy <br/>
Letterbox, he is starting to letterbox)  and drop it off already.  I <br/>
hope everyone had a great weekend, Teach &amp; Preach (Robin &amp; Dan)<br/>
