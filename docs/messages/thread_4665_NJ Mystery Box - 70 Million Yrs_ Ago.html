<br/>
Wanda and Pete reported my mystery box missing last<br/>
week, so I went out to check its status.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted everyone to know that my box is intact. <br/>
Sorry, Wanda and Pete, maybe you're mistaken about the<br/>
location (it is a mystery afterall).<br/>

WOW! turns out we had the exact right spot after all, but just didn't <br/>
dig deep enough! Guess we took letterbox placement guidelines a bit <br/>
too literally, although we did remove some of the area's surface <br/>
trash! Hope the next folks along have a better experience!!!<br/>
We also visited several other boxes in the area, including one where <br/>
someone who recently found a lot of hitchers wrote us she had picked <br/>
up our Little Tiny Sailboat and left another hitcher in its place, <br/>
but couldn't remember which one.  Turns out there hadn't been any <br/>
hitcher left behind , but we decided to leave a little something <br/>
ourselves anyway, to show our appreciation for all the great boxes <br/>
we've found in the area lately. Hope you all get to share in the fun <br/>
in a timely fashion, and please forgive me for being such a <br/>
blabbermouth! (I guess I just can't help it!)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, for what's supposed to be a fancy neighborhood,<br/>
that spot collects a lot of wind-blown trash.  That's<br/>
because folks insist on putting out their trash and<br/>
recycle the night before collection no matter what<br/>
kind of storm or gale is blowing through.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about adding a couple more boxes to the<br/>
immediate area to make it worth the trip.  Just can't<br/>
think of any other points of interest.<br/>
