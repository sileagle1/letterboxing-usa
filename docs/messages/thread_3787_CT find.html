                    <html><body><div>I experienced an incredible coincidence this weekend.  I was reading Rubberstampmadness magazine, and saw the paragraph about letterboxing.  The next day while taking a hike with my family, we found a letterbox, completely by accident!  We couldn't believe it!  Now I would love to find the clues that should have lead us there?  Can anyone suggest how I could track this down?  The box was found in Cromwell CT. I believe the title was River View. I would really appreciate any help. I think I may have found a new hobby!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Yvonne Coyle</div></body></html>
