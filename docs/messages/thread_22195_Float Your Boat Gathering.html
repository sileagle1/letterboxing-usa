                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Everyone,<br/>
Just found out some more info about Liberty Lake. The pricing is as <br/>
follows. RV sites (one rv, one small tent, four people) is $24. Each <br/>
additional person over 5 is $2. Tent sites (Two tents, four people) <br/>
is $18. Each additional person is $2. If the people who have signed <br/>
up would like to save some money, we could place more than one <br/>
family on a tent site. For example if two families come and there a <br/>
two adults in each family and the family one has three children <br/>
under five and family two has one child over five, the site will <br/>
cost $20 for both families. Then both families can split the cost. <br/>
If the people who have signed up can e-mail me with the day they <br/>
plan on coming and if they mind sharing a site or not. Then I can e-<br/>
mail each with the e-mail of the family you will share with, so you <br/>
can coordinate when coming in the gate. Hope this isn't too <br/>
comfusing. The prices are pre night. Hope to see everyone there.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you that are just coming in.<br/>
The float your boat gathering is a gathering on Labor Day weekend. <br/>
Sign ups are sill open. It is in Eastern Washington at Liberty Lake <br/>
County Park, near Spokane. There will be a stamp carving clinic, a <br/>
logbook making clinic, a hunt, potluck, exchange and a bonus box. <br/>
Please e-mail me if you would like to come. RV's a encouraged to <br/>
come on Friday, due to lack of RV space, but tents can come either <br/>
Friday or Saturday, dur to they can stick us anywhere there is open <br/>
space. Howerver if coming on Saturday you may not get a site with a <br/>
firepit or grill. Please keep this in mind when planning.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing everyone.<br/>
