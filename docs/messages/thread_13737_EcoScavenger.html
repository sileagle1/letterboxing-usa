<br/>
We can certainly appreciate the sentiments.  It was just a few months after <br/>
we started last year (I just realized today would be our one year anniversary) <br/>
that we wrote saying we thought things were getting out of hand as far as the <br/>
placing of way too many boxes in not enough space.  We believed then as we <br/>
even more so do now, that this preoccupation with "numbers" was cheapening the <br/>
activity.  We got into letterboxing because we enjoy the outdoors and thought <br/>
this "scavenger hunt" type of activity would be a lot of fun.  It's lost much of <br/>
its appeal over time.  We feel that many of our efforts at planting <br/>
interesting series in nice locations have been wasted.  It seems that many of our boxes <br/>
(and other people's as well, we have noticed) that require someone to hike <br/>
more than a couple of miles receive very little attention.  We have also noticed <br/>
that oftentimes we will place one or two boxes within a reasonable distance <br/>
in a new area (we generally don't like to plant in areas that already have <br/>
boxes) then soon after someone else will go out there and put six or something in <br/>
the same or less amount of space.  In addition, we find it amusing the way <br/>
people carry on about the "dangers" (poison ivy, snakes, trails with trees across <br/>
them) of planting anywhere, it seems, more remote than an in town park.  <br/>
Letterboxing is, after all, an outdoor activity, although by many of the <br/>
"complaints" that we've seen written on the talk site, it would seem that many <br/>
participants have more in common with stamp collectors than hikers or outdoors people. <br/>
 Well, quite enough said.  I don't know if we'll get involved in the <br/>
EcoScavenging as we don't need to be a part of an organized activity to enjoy the <br/>
outdoors but I do think it's a great idea and hope that it catches on with those <br/>
that do.  We will probably just plant the few remaining boxes that we had <br/>
planned and then not do anymore.  I'm sure that we will gradually lose interest in <br/>
finding them as well; we already have to a degree.  So, take care.<br/>
