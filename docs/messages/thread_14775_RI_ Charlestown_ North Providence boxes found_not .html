Rustypuff and I finally tackled the My Favorite Ornaments series in <br/>
Burlingame State Park (we knew that if we waited until after the <br/>
festival, we wouldn't want to tackle anything!).<br/>
<br/>
All of the following boxes were found in place, intact, and dry.<br/>
<br/>
Mushroom<br/>
Broken Heart (log is full)<br/>
Cuckoo Clock<br/>
Pickle (not so elusive for us!)<br/>
The Gingerbread Man<br/>
Kindergarten Keepsakes<br/>
Gold Star (log full)<br/>
Candy Cane (log full)<br/>
Silver Bow (log full)<br/>
Grace<br/>
<br/>
Your Christmas Tree and Stocking are MIA.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately after leaving the festival we checked in on the Green <br/>
Trails Quest: Charlestown Chamber of Commerce Quest.  It is also MIA.<br/>
<br/>
Later, we attempted Dexter in North Providence for the second time, <br/>
with similar disappointing results.  Are we blind?<br/>
<br/>
We found our first hitchhiker in a verrrry lonnnng time in the <br/>
Mushroom box.  We'll make sure that Java Man moves on to points <br/>
unknown.<br/>
