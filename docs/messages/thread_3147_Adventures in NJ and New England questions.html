The first, MartianMaggot's letterbox at Kennedy Park in<br/>&gt; Sayreville, NJ, completely eluded us. Although the clues are brief and the<br/>&gt; hike simple, we were nevertheless unsuccessful in finding it (despite<br/>&gt; spending a good deal of time poking around nearly every "double pine tree" in<br/>&gt; the place). Our disappointment was short-lived when we sought out and found<br/>&gt; the second box of the day, the "Crabbing Bridge" letterbox at Cheesequake<br/>&gt; State Park. An interesting hike and a very nice stamp!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Two mystery boxes placed by New Jersey's Perfect Circle Letterboxing Guild<br/>&gt; (which, BTW, has a terrific website) awaited us on Sunday. First up was<br/>&gt; "Panic/Attack"; we were in the right town, in the right park, at the right<br/>&gt; monument (worth the visit alone), but were unable to locate this box! After<br/>&gt; scouring its resting spot (unmistakable from the clues), we reached the sad<br/>&gt; conclusion that this letterbox must be missing from its perch. Perhaps<br/>&gt; someone from PCLG can confirm whether or not this box is still in place.<br/>&gt; Disappointed but undeterred, we headed to another, final resting place and<br/>&gt; easily found the "Mooving Tale" letterbox. After wiping a tear or two from<br/>&gt; our eyes, we stamped in and then proceeded on our way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All in all, we had another excellent roadtrip, made even more enjoyable by<br/>&gt; those Jersey letterboxes. Many thanks to the "Jersey girls" and "Jersey boys"<br/>&gt; who planted 'em!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Alan from Axtown<br/>&gt; Another Home-Cooked Message<br/><br/><br/>To unsubscribe: mailto:letterbox-usa-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br/>List info, archives, etc: http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html<br/><br/><br/>Your use of Yahoo!

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Kimberly;  Speaking for CT, our state seems to be very <br/>
dog-friendly.  We take our dog on all our hikes.  From what I can tell<br/>
most of our state parks and forests permit dogs (on a leash.) <br/>
The only one I know of that does not is Dinosaur in Rocky Hill - <br/>
bummer!  Also on another note, come on over and see our 4-Paws Only<br/>
page at www.letterboxingcentral.com and if you send us Duke's picture <br/>
we'll post it and enter him into our semi-monthly Pooch Patch drawing.<br/>
 Hope this helps.<br/>
