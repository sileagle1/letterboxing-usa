                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is a 6$ fee for out of county residents to drive into the main <br/>
gate during the weekends in the summer.  If you are out of county <br/>
like me and don't wish to pay there is a State run boat launch that <br/>
is the next exit over on 123.  There is no charge to drive and park <br/>
in this lot as it is a state lot.  To get to where the Scriminal <br/>
clues start follow the paved trail to the left the lake. You will <br/>
see the big parking lot on the laft.  Old boots clues can be started <br/>
from here, just head right and you will hit the dam.   <br/>
