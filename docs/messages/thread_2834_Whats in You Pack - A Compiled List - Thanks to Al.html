Suggestions to Consider<br/>
<br/>
		Bear Guard (Pepper Spray)     Implies keeping it <br/>
                                              handy and knowing when<br/>
                                              to use it.<br/>
<br/>
		GPS - Assumes that you have a map which is<br/>
                      appropriately marked (Lat/Long)<br/>
                      or that you have set up waypoints. Just<br/>
                      knowing which way the car is, may not<br/>
                      help you much., the direction might be<br/>
                      through a lake.<br/>
