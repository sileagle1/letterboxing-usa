We only did the one on the way back from seeing his mother. The bridge in the woods letterbox in Wayland was intact. A lovely little hike but the mosquitos were fierce! We didn't go across the bridge as the bugs were driving us crazy! We were both drenched in repellant too! Hopefully we'll get to do some more next weekend! Pray for sun!<br/>
