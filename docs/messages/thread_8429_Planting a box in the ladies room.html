<div><span class="10225803-16102002">A few months ago I 
was checking on one of of my letterboxes called Nipmuck and Natchaug Junction, 
in Ashford CT. The box was planted behind a huge oval rock. Great spot. You 
couldn't miss this rock. When checking up on it I noticed that on another flat 
rock on the trail in blue was written "Ladies Room Rock". There was also a 
notation in my book mentioning this.The box was also found by the Trail master 
who just wrote me a note in the log book and left my box where it was. 
 Molly Chickabirdie and I went to it yesterday with the intentions of 
moving it. I reached under the rock and found my letterbox and also a plastic 
bag. I said "look we have a hitchhiker". I pulled it out and found that the 
trail master put a plastic bag next to my box. The plastic bag I thought was a 
hitchhiker had a roll of toilet paper in it. I didn't find it so amusing but 
Chickabirdie sure did. Needless to say I have moved my letterbox and adjusted 
the clues......Chuck and Molly</span></div></body></html>
