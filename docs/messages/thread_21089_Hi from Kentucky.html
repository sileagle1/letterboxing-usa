My husband and I are just getting started in this.  I have been to <br/>
the letterboxing.org site and saw there are not many letterboxes <br/>
hidden in our location, but we look forward to travelling soon to <br/>
join in all the fun.  We are going to place our first letterbox later <br/>
this week.<br/>

Welcome aboard.  I occaisional travel to the Paducah area on business <br/>
and can attest that there are not many boxes in the Bluegrass State, <br/>
though I hope to plop some more in the Land Between the Lakes, time <br/>
permitting!<br/>

What a great opportunity you have.  I am from CT and there are few <br/>
places that don't have boxes planted.  You have a whole state to <br/>
work with.  Plant some in your favorite parks.  If you have contacts <br/>
with scout troops or nature centers, have them plant and find boxes <br/>
as a new activity for the kids.  It will grow as the hobby is better <br/>
known.<br/>

Hi!<br/>
I'm not sure what part of Kentucky you live in, but there are some <br/>
great letterboxing spots in southern Ohio. Look in the Cincy area, <br/>
as well as in and around Portsmouth. You are going to get soooo <br/>
hooked on this :)<br/>
