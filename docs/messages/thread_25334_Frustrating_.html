I feel your pain.  I recently had a geocacher remove my box and put his in its place.  My trailname at the time was linda0910 so he figured I must have been a letterboxer in 2009/2010. He told me that he thought my box must be old and I am not letterboxing anymore.  He liked the spot so he took it thinking my box was trash.  On the plus side I got to him before he actually threw it away.<br/>

I've seen a lot of people labeling their boxes like that. Also what seems to work is writing on the stamp "Not For Trade," the way a geocacher would do to indicate that a particular item is supposed to stay in the cache.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Aloha All!  As a major geocacher that also letterboxes secondarily I'm sorry<br/>
to hear of all the alleged problems with Geocachers.  That saddens me.  I<br/>
was searching for a cache yesterday when I was pleasantly surprised when<br/>
what I thought was the actual cache turned out to be a letterbox.  Yea us!<br/>
It was an easy find since it wasn't that well hidden.  The actual geocache<br/>
turned out to be an even easier find since it was laying out in the open<br/>
with nothing near to have been hidden in or around.  (sigh)  Hopefully we've<br/>
hidden both  much better than found.  In this case both the letterbox and<br/>
geocache clearly stated what they were.  The letterbox included the log<br/>
book, slips of paper with the name and website, and a paper towel wrapped<br/>
stamp.  Unfortunately it did not include a stamp pad and ours was DRY!  Dang<br/>
it!  Since we don't always read the cache pages prior to searching (driving<br/>
home from work without the PDA) it was nice to read upon logging that the<br/>
cache owner states that the letterbox is nearby and to please be sure and<br/>
replace it as you would a geocache should you happen upon it.  I do believe<br/>
that the majority of cachers attempt to treat letterboxes as they would a<br/>
geocache; especially those that have placed some of their own.  Those same<br/>
cachers are hopefully denoting the possibility of a letterbox in the area on<br/>
their cache pages if they know about it.   I know I did as soon as cachers<br/>
started logging having found a letterbox that popped up right next to one of<br/>
my caches placed years earlier.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With all the "hunting" games out now (geocaching, terracaching,<br/>
letterboxing) the cross contamination is probably going to be an even bigger<br/>
issue in the future.  (Last year, after finding a geocache we opted to visit<br/>
the little civil war museum the cache took us to.  The proprietor asked what<br/>
brought us there and we told him and thanked him for allowing the placement.<br/>
He then asked if we had found the letterbox and directed us to it.<br/>
Wonderful!  We signed and stamped.  He then asked how we liked the cache<br/>
"down there".  Huh?  That's not where we were.  He walked us over so that we<br/>
could find our first terracache.  All three within a 150' radius!)  Now we<br/>
try and search all three categories when going to place a cache and will<br/>
make reference to what is found on the cache page if applicable and mark our<br/>
cache containers appropriately.  It seems to be working for us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To Linda ~  hopefully you gave the cacher that removed your box a good<br/>
talking to.  That is unacceptable in any game.  Especially if it indicated<br/>
what it was within or on.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; That is how you sometimes have to look at it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Makes me wonder, I almost feel like I want to take all of the junk out <br/>
&gt; of the geocaches I accidentally find.  I won't, I am better then that, <br/>
&gt; but it makes me want to.<br/>
