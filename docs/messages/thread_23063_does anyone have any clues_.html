Here is what I do for just such an unfortunate event. In Internet Explorer  <br/>
you can add each of your favorite regions (I wouldn't suggest too many) as a  <br/>
favorite place. When the pop up window comes up, you can check the box that <br/>
says  "Make available offline". Then you'll be able to check the "Customize" <br/>
button".  On the next pop up window, you can tell it how many pages deep you  want <br/>
the favorite place to save. I suggest keeping it at one, although that  won't <br/>
get you every clue.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you have the clues available to you (as of the point in time when you  <br/>
did this) for viewing when the site isn't available. You can synchronize the  <br/>
offline pages periodically under the Tools menu. This doesn't work for search  <br/>
results, but it will work when you view a specific region. It also will not <br/>
work  with Atlasquest clues.<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to be prepared, you can do this on your laptop and bring  <br/>
your laptop with you just in case you find yourself in an area and want to do <br/>
a  box for which you didn't prepare by printing out the clues in advance.<br/>

If you know the name of the boxes you are looking for, here is what you <br/>
can do:<br/>
<br/>
First, go to Google and search for the box's name plus the word <br/>
letterbox.  This usually brings up the letterboxing.org link first.<br/>
<br/>
Next, DO NOT click on the link, but instead click on the cached link. <br/>
This link will take you to an older version of the page.  It may be a <br/>
few days, or even a few months old.  It will look like this:<br/>
