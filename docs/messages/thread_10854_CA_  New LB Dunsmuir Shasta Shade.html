<br/>
Dunsmuir City Park<br/>
Dunsmuir (50 miles North of Redding)<br/>
Siskiyou County<br/>
California<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Take I-5 to any Dunsmuir Exit (#730 will work).  Head <br/>
West of the Interstate, the park is near the locomotive and the ball <br/>
park.  Park near the locomotive.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  Bring blue, green &amp; black markers for added effect.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  From SP #1727, head past 3rd base.  Note Alexander's Fountain <br/>
which beautifies the place.  From Pusher to Dunsmuir its history does <br/>
roost, as Mt. Shasta bound trains here often needed a big boost.  <br/>
Continue uphill, tennis anyone?  Drats, forgot our tennis shoes <br/>
today, it'll just have to go undone.  Park trail to picnic area is <br/>
next where you are led, river right, river straight is the direction <br/>
you head.  To the picnic area and gazebo for a bit of a rest, then <br/>
find Ted Fay's plaque on a boulder down to the West.  Then N past 2 <br/>
tables and a bench you must tread, then past 10 square wooden posts <br/>
that you count in your head.  From the 10th wooden post, head 45 <br/>
degrees, 92 steps to 3 mossy boulders on your right neighbored by <br/>
trees.  Continue along the trail approximately 50 degrees you now <br/>
bear, take 14 steps to a square rock on your right with much caution <br/>
and care.  Next 60 degrees and 10 steps you follow, for your quest, 3 <br/>
boulders up at 120, between #3 &amp; #4, hides under rocks in a cubby-<br/>
hole hollow.<br/>
