Letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
We were very dismayed by the graffiti and obviousness of it.  While <br/>
it was hidden in a wall, there were spray painted arrows pointing to <br/>
the exact location, and in addition, the rock where the box was <br/>
planted was also spray painted.  <br/>
<br/>
While letterboxing is a fun treasure hunting experience, we should <br/>
all take care not to disturb the natural environment when placing new <br/>
boxes.  <br/>

I hope that these new letterbox placers will be reminded by us all to <br/>
respect nature and keep our secrets hidden from view!<br/>

the painter arrived on the scene. I think there are a few individuals <br/>

I certainly wasn't looking to "lambaste" anyone, or I would have told <br/>
you the name of the box/location.  <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to add a comment for newbies of "what not to do!"  This <br/>
particular box had been placed the day before we found it, and I'm <br/>
still hoping that the graffiti with all the arrows was there first.  <br/>
I put a photo in the "Photos" area of this group.<br/>
