coming to Blackfoot around the end of July.  I wanted to write and see if<br/>
you are still planning on that.  If so, you will have to let me know.  Don<br/>

that aren't on the map yet, and I have several new ones in Idaho Falls.<br/>
It's wild, when I started this whole thing earlier this year, there were<br/>
only two boxes in all of Eastern ID.  Now there's somewhere near 16 or 17!!<br/>
I just love it!<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you have time and would like to meet for an exchange, I would be<br/>
happy to see you.  If you are busy with family obligations, I understand.<br/>
Just thought I'd throw the thought out and see if it landed anywhere.<br/>

Boy am I glad! I usually read all the messages unless they have State <br/>
initials in the subject line and this post had me totally lost. lol At least I know I <br/>
haven't lost my mind at 34 after all. <br/>
