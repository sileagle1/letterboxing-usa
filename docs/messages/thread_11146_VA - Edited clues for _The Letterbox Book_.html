Regional library in Manassas in hopes that it won't take 2 or 3 <br/>
visits to find it.  I want to have some "challanging" letterboxes but <br/>
not this one.<br/>

Knights of Colombo, Please update the Doubtful Guests website.<br/>

Many thanks,<br/>

    "Hey, it's a full moon.  Do you think we'll get any crazies <br/>
tonight?" <br/>
     "What do you mean `we', Michele?  How come `I' always get the <br/>
strange ones?" <br/>
     "Oh, you attract them my dear.  I'm sure." <br/>
     Faye made a face.  Yet for some reason Faye did seem to get more <br/>
than her fair share of the people with odd requests, or people who <br/>
were just plain odd.  Surely, that last full moon was just a <br/>
coincidence though.<br/>
     "Oh great!  Here comes one now," she thought, spying a woman in <br/>
what looked like a cross between an old nun's habit and maybe a <br/>
nursing outfit. <br/>
     "I am interested in anesthesia and the history of the Crimea."  <br/>
     "Yes Miss"  <br/>
     "You may call me Florence." <br/>
     "...Florence.  Here are a couple of places you can look.  I'll <br/>
write them down for you."  <br/>
     Miss Florence had only just left when a man in a high school <br/>
band outfit approached her.  "Hello."  "Wait.  Let me guess.  You are <br/>
looking for `how to' books on band leading?"<br/>
     "Why yes Madame Librarian.  How did you know?"  Faye took off <br/>
her glasses while she handed him some notes.  He left with a wide <br/>
smile.<br/>
     In the corner of her eye she sensed rather than saw a dark shape <br/>
approaching the desk.  She turned to face a tall man in a rough dark <br/>
cloak with a hood.  "Is someone having a costume party," she thought <br/>
to herself, "Where are these people coming from?"<br/>
     It leaned towards her and uttered in a loud, breathy <br/>
whisper, "Shiiire.  Bagggins." <br/>
     "You must want fi fi fiction.  Under T T T o l," she stuttered <br/>
in reply.  "Was he ever creepy.  I couldn't even see his face," she <br/>
shuddered as he glided off. <br/>
     "Excuse me Ma'am, I was hoping you might be able to help me with <br/>
a little inquiry."  <br/>
     She was smiling at the quaint speech before she looked up and <br/>
stifled a laugh.  The stranger's clothes were so old fashioned he <br/>
looked like a play actor.  <br/>
     "Ma'am?"  <br/>
     "Um, yes.  How may I help you?"  <br/>
     "I am looking for something but I don't know where to begin."<br/>
     "Well Mr. um..."<br/>
     "Raines, Harrison Raines, Ma'am."<br/>
     "...Mr. Raines.  Just because you can't find your subject listed <br/>
in the catalog doesn't mean you can't find something.  Consider what <br/>
you are looking for, then think of other subjects that are related to <br/>
it and look for them."<br/>
     Someone behind Mr. Raines suddenly made a funny look and took <br/>
off in the direction of the catalog search stations.<br/>
     "What is it you are looking for Mr. Raines?"<br/>
     "I am investigating a Murder at Balls Bluff."  Raines went on to <br/>
describe what he knew, trying to think of other subjects that might <br/>
be related.<br/>
     "Well there are books on the Civil War, Lincoln, horses, <br/>
firearms and even women who dressed as men to fight in the conflict.  <br/>
I'll jot some down for you."<br/>
     "Thank you Ma'am.  I'm sorry I am not familiar with the <br/>
library.  Might you be free to accompany me and acquaint me with the <br/>
layout."  <br/>
     "Um, well...why certainly.  I would be glad to."<br/>
<br/>
     Michele had noticed that Faye was talking to herself even more <br/>
than usual tonight.  Then she saw Faye walking back towards the <br/>
stacks talking to no one next to her and walking as if she were <br/>
holding someone's arm.  Michele would have laughed if she hadn't been <br/>
so startled.  "I'll have to see just what Faye's been reading lately."<br/>
<br/>
Note:  You are not looking for a regular commercially printed book <br/>
that has been hollowed out and made into a letterbox so there is no <br/>
need to pull all the books off the shelves looking for it.  You are <br/>
looking for `The Letterbox Book' and should know it when you see it.  <br/>
If you find the letterbox missing or damaged or if you want a hint <br/>
write theDoubtfulGuests@yahoo.com. <br/>
