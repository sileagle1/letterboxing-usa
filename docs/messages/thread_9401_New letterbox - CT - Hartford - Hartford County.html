<br/>
Planted by the Autumn Club on November 10 ,2002<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty - easy<br/>
Time - practically a drive by<br/>
Directions to starting place - Elizabeth Park is located at the<br/>
corner of Prospect Avenue and Asylum Avenue on the Hartford / West <br/>
Hartford line.  Take exit 44 (Prospect Avenue) off I- 84 and head <br/>
North on Prospect Avenue.  Look on the right side for a small sign <br/>
that says Sunrise Overlook.  If you come to Asylum Street, you have <br/>
gone a touch too far.  <br/>
<br/>
Details you should know - There are a few parking places at the <br/>
overlook, but if they are full, there's room across the street. <br/>
There is a nice view of Hartford downtown from here.  <br/>
<br/>
Details you don't need to know - Our governor and his family live in <br/>
the next house north on the right side of Prospect Avenue (across the <br/>
intersection).  Despite the fact that some of the Autumn Club live in <br/>
the neighborhood, we've never been invited over.  Of course, we've <br/>
never invited them either, so <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Find the one handicapped parking sign in the small parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Walk 25 paces at 55 degrees from the handicapped parking sign to a <br/>
tree that has a V.  For the record, the tree is not doing so well.<br/>
<br/>
Take a compass reading of 345 to 350 degrees through the "V".  Look <br/>
past four trees to a tree that looks like it could be a chair.  Take <br/>
17 paces from the tree with all the little woodpecker holes to the <br/>
throne.<br/>
<br/>
On the chair where the Queen of the Autumn sits, look for her cup <br/>
holder on the left.  Underneath some bark lies our first annual<br/>
Autumn Club letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
This is a rather busy spot, so discretion would be appreciated.<br/>
