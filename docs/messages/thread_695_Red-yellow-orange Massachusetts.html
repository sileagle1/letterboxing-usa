I've carved up the stamp already - a quote from a poem of that adopted<br/>
Yankee, Robert Frost (once I have the stamp done, everything else is a<br/>

I'm still debating on the book, though - I found a small blank book at a<br/>
local bookshop, but the pages are only 3" x 2-1/4"  Does anyone use<br/>
stamps bigger than this to stamp in their book?  The book is the perfect<br/>
size for the big or small Staedtler erasers, but I'm just concerned that<br/>
if someone is using a stamp that's about the size of Uncle Walter's<br/>
small blocks, it may not fit!<br/>

With regards to Letterbox Saint-Exupery in Wendell State Forest, <br/>
Massachusetts:  Only 2 folks have found it so far, which is about what I <br/>
expected since the clue works by metaphor rather than straightforward <br/>
directions.  There are still 3 glow-in-the-dark stars to be collected!  <br/>
Here's a hint for anyone who is interested.  A new sign has been erected on <br/>
the Metacomet-Monadnock trail explaining that you are in the Hidden Valley <br/>
Memorial Forest (which means, I guess, that it is a forest within a forest). <br/>
  Letterbox Saint-Exupery is hidden beneath "the stars of the forest floor" <br/>
on the left of the trail, just a few feet before you reach that sign.  By <br/>
the way, the waterfalls that you pass in search of this box are just <br/>
gorgeous right now.<br/>
<br/>
Jay, here's a hint for the 3rd box (Letterbox Vincent):  After you get to <br/>
the sign I described above, keep going a bit farther.  Right after the trail <br/>
veers to the right, away from the stream which has been on your left for <br/>
quite some time, keep your eyes open for a big fallen tree on the left.  <br/>
Look near this fallen tree for a birch log with a piece of birch bark <br/>
nestled up against it.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, if you go to Wendell, keep in mind that the Quabbin Reservoir <br/>
boxes are only about a 20-25 minute drive south of Wendell!<br/>

excuse to get out and letterbox, this autumn is it! We were out by<br/>
Narragansett Bay yesterday and the brilliance of the maples were<br/>
perfectly offset by the blue water. The QE2 was in port, and I figure<br/>
if people are willing to pay $$thousands$$ to visit, there must be<br/>
something to it.<br/>
<br/>
Now we've got to get back up to Wendel to find that third letterbox of<br/>
yours. We loved StEx and the bonus box, but missed the third one....<br/>

overlooking something. There was a beautiful light warm rain and the<br/>
green, the rocks, and the wet will always be a memory for both of us.<br/>
We left happy and satisfied with our two stamps, with seeing Tom's<br/>
awesome personal stamp image, and with Ned's stars and a piece of<br/>
quartz, and went straight from that peaceful setting to the adrenalin<br/>
rush of the norba mountain bike national championships at Mt Snow. We<br/>
got muddy, we got bloody, and both did very well with our races. One of<br/>

plenty to cheer about that week in New England.<br/>

The book is the one that I want to leave in the box - but I think I may<br/>
pick up another to use as my passport.  Most of the pages are unlined in<br/>
the book, but I didn't realize until after I got home that there are<br/>
words on every few pages in big font ex. courage, strength, balance.  I<br/>
picked up the book called "A Woman's Notes" because I liked the sage<br/>
green cover and I suppose each book will have different words in it. <br/>
The series is called "Little Scribbles" and has a picture-frame cover on<br/>
it (you can add your own picture).  The book itself is 3-1/4 x 2-3/4" in<br/>
size and is a "regular" bound book (not spiral) - on the last page of<br/>
the book it says it has been bound using handcraft methods and<br/>
Smyth-sewn.  The manufacturer is Running Press Miniature Editions, ISBN<br/>
0-7624-0510-4 and the cost was $4.95.  It also has a ribbon page-marker<br/>
and a mini-pen attached to it.  It's kinda cute.  I'll bet you can pick<br/>
these up at Barnes and Noble or Borders in the blank journal section.  I<br/>
picked mine up at a local bookshop called, The Toadstool.<br/>

Good luck in finding it!  Holler if you need more help!<br/>

Well if I can't find it with all that information...I'll have to hand in my<br/>
shopping license.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
The reason why I asked if you were leaving in the box or not was because I<br/>
have carved a 3"x3" stamp for one of my letterboxes.  Because I couldn't<br/>
predict what I might find in a letterbox I decided to stamp the letterbox<br/>
image on loose paper (and write down any details that I want to remember). <br/>
When I get home I cut it out and paste it in a large hard cover sketch book<br/>
along with the maps, clues, and my comments on the adventure.  When I'm<br/>
creating a letterbox I do basically the same thing.  Just thought I would<br/>
share.<br/>
<br/>
Take Care and Thanks for the info,  Wendy<br/>

Accessible letterbox? Wow! My 92-year-old Mom may get her wish to<br/>
a-hunting. Thanks!<br/>

A wise old friend of mine once told me that the secret of happiness was<br/>
in developing a "sense of nostalgia for the present." I like that very<br/>
much. I also like Robert DiNero's character from New York New York:<br/>
Its a "major chord" when you are doing what you love to do, with someone<br/>
that you love, in a place that you love to be..<br/>
<br/>
Well, VT is pretty fine these days as well. Our mountain view changes<br/>
breathtakingly every day every season.  It never gets old or worn. <br/>
<br/>
So a toast to happy letterboxers everywhere. Carpe Diem!<br/>
