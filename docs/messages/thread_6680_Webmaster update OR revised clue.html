On  December 3, 2001 Funhog placed the Doyle Owl letterbox at Reed<br/>
College in the City of Portland in Multnomah County, Oregon. This<br/>
letterbox is a tribute to the elusive Doyle Owl. Sometime early in the<br/>
history of Reed College, a group of students temporarily neglected<br/>
their studies and absconded with a large piece of architectural cement<br/>
in the shape of an owl, source unknown.  For the better part of a<br/>
century, this icon has been known to make hasty appearances in<br/>
unexpected places, sometimes by unconventional means and has been the<br/>
object of intense scheming and creative thievery. Once exhibited, it<br/>
always manages to disappear, secreted in an unknown hiding place until<br/>
its next surprise public appearance. The owl has been transported by<br/>
helicopter, appeared in a Tears for Fears video, traveled to San<br/>
Francisco and been submerged in various bodies of water. At any given<br/>
time the owl's location and current guardian is generally unknown. <br/>
<br/>
to the Trailhead:<br/>
Park at Reed College in the East Parking Lot located on SE Woodstock<br/>
Boulevard, just east of SE 36th.<br/>
<br/>
to the Letterbox:<br/>
Walk toward the main part of the campus on the sidewalk at the north<br/>
side of the parking lot. You will come to a campus map. Just north of<br/>
the bookstore/dining hall find the rising tiers with a lakefront view.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On March 28, 2002 Funhog placed the Hidden Dragon Letterbox at Howell Territorial Park on Sauvie Island, <br/>
Multnomah County, Oregon. In this park you will see the island's only remaining home built by Oregon Trail <br/>
homesteaders. There is also and agricultural museum, a wetland great for wildlife viewing, an orchard of <br/>
heritage fruit trees, and a touch of sorcery.<br/>
<br/>
to the Trailhead: from Portland head west on Highway 30 to the Sauvie Island Bridge. Once across the <br/>
bridge drive north about a mile to Howell Park Road. Turn right and park in one of the turnouts by the <br/>
Bybee-Howell house.<br/>
<br/>
to the Letterbox: Stroll through the wizened orchard, counting the trees. Don't bite into an apple. Find <br/>
the geese under Medusa's spell. Stand shoulder to wing and in the distance you will see a golden square <br/>
marked with a magic number. Add this to the tally of trees and set your compass. Seventy-seven steps <br/>
away, the enchanted ring sits in wait upon a metal platter garnished with a sprig of Oregon grape. Slip the <br/>
ring upon your finger and the Hidden Dragon will appear before your eyes. The Dragon prefers to hide in <br/>
the deepest, darkest recesses when not receiving visitors. A magic wand can send it there.<br/>
