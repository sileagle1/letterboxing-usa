Placed by: Lottabit &amp; Lillbit<br/>

County/State: Cowlitz, WA (Region 5)<br/>
Town: Longview<br/>
Current # of Boxes in Series: 3<br/>
<br/>
The Book Keeper Letterbox will house clues to other boxes based on, what we <br/>
consider, classic novels. Right now, the Book Keeper box has clues to two <br/>
other boxes (The Count of Monte Cristo &amp; Treasure Island). If you have <br/>
letterboxes that fit the basic theme and hide them in this general area, <br/>
feel free to hide clues to them in the Book Keeper box. Just email us <br/>
off-list and let us know!<br/>
<br/>
Clue: In the side yard of the Longview Public Library, you'll find many <br/>
trees. From the tree giving shelter to the Book Keeper, you can see brown <br/>
mountains, a musical child's toy, a very still girl reading to a cat, a <br/>
president's white head and a woodsy squirrel. Once you've found this tree, <br/>
you'll find the Book Keeper is the 'root' of this series.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: We suggest bringing along a variety of colored ink pens to do this <br/>
series. The stamps look best when stamped in color!<br/>
