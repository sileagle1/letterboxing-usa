                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just want to clarify the circumstances of my famous letterboxing purple<br/>
heart fall off the cliff. My fall had nothing to do with the clues. A rating<br/>
system would not have helped. I did a dumb thing. Looked over the side of a<br/>
cliff for a box that was not there, I was in the wrong spot. One foot<br/>
slipped and that was that. A rating system does not stop a person from doing<br/>
stupid things. I am a good example. .....Chuck of Chuck and Molly.<br/>
