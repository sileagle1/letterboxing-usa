Hello Everyone,<br/>
      As some of you may now Olwe and I are hosting a gathering up here in <br/>
Gorham, Maine.  We had decided to do a "carving contest" with the theme of <br/>
WILL WORK FOR WORLD PEACE.  I was going to keep this closed to only <br/>
people who came to the gathering but have decided to change that rule.  <br/>
There is more information on Mark Pepes site and here is the link for the <br/>
contest.<br/>

<br/>
Anyone who does not attend the gathering and wishes to still recive a copy of <br/>
everyone's art work (that they can choose to bind into a book themselves) <br/>
please send three dollars to pay for shipping and envelopes and I would be <br/>
happy to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Please e-mail me off list with any questions.<br/>
