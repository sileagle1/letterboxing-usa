An area of land in Frisco is referred to by the locals as The <br/>
Peninsula. White River National Forest is on part of The Peninsula, <br/>
but the letterbox is located outside of the gate on city property so <br/>
as to "leave no trace". From Main St. and Summit Blvd. in Frisco take <br/>
Highway 9 south. After about a half mile, you'll pass the Frisco <br/>
Nordic Center on your left. The next turnoff on your left is the one <br/>
you take and it has a sign which says, "Peak One / Pine Cove <br/>
Campgrounds, White River National Forest". It's about a mile from the <br/>
Main St. and Summit Blvd. intersection. Soon after you turn in, <br/>
you'll see a sign which says, "Campground Boat Ramp" pointing left. <br/>
Don't take this road. Instead take the gravel road to the right and <br/>
drive about a quarter mile to a locked gate and park on the side of <br/>
the road. From the center of the gate at a heading of 175 degrees <br/>
lies a 3 ft. high round boulder which blocks a dirt road. Walk down <br/>
this dirt road. You'll pass some large flat rocks on your right. At <br/>
the first "intersection" take the path heading right due NE up a <br/>
slope. At the next "intersection" at the top of the slope, follow the <br/>
path left due N. Take 30-35 steps and on your right is a small 1 ft. <br/>
high, cubed-shaped rock that is perfect for stamping in. From this <br/>
rock at about 85 degrees, take about 15 steps and you'll see a half-<br/>
buried, lichen-covered rock with about one-eighth of it broken off to <br/>
form a crevasse. Inside this crevasse under smaller rocks is hidden <br/>
The Peninsula Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Save some time to hike beyond the gate where your car is parked. It's <br/>
two miles to a beautiful view of Lake Dillon. <br/>

parents house in Dillon where my mom and I went on our first letterbox<br/>
hunt on the 11-7 trail on Keystone Mountain.  Unfortunately, it wasn't<br/>
there.  Have you ever found that letterbox?  My mom and I also left a<br/>
new letterbox on the Tenderfoot Trail in Dillon, but I haven't posted<br/>
the clues yet -- I'm working on it!<br/>
