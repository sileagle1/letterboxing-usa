<br/>
Bud actually has alot of cachet in many parts of<br/>
the world outside the US.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, a large Belgian/Brazilian brewer (InBev,<br/>
best known for the Stella Artois brand in America)<br/>
recently bought AB with the goal of making Bud a<br/>
worldwide, mass-produced, mass distributed brand.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure that is more than you wanted to know about<br/>
the global beer business.  I personally drink beer<br/>
brewed right here in Chester County (Victory), and<br/>
only know of Bud's business as a result of my work.<br/>
<br/>
I've always wondered, however, if I put Bud up against<br/>
cachet beers in a blind taste test, would casual beer<br/>
drinkers be able to tell?  I'm sure those who know beer<br/>
better than myself may have done this experiment, or<br/>
could at least answer the question.<br/>

I'd say with both the placers you describe that the placer is more likely a<br/>

folks to come spend some money.  Hopefully lots of money.  :-)  That's the<br/>

Since it is indoors, it allows the placer to use materials that would not survive the elements and since there is not usually a lengthy hike involved, I have seen some very creative ways of delivering clues so as to still provide a fun and challanging experience for finders.  Of course there are some that make no attempt at creativity, but this is just as true of trail boxes.  This is due to the placer, not the place.  Besides, there is nothing that says a letterbox has to be *creative.*  Sure I love finding boxes with elegant handmade books and unqiue packaging.  I love clever locations and clues and boxes with themes based on history, location, names, etc., but this is personal preference and creativity is really not a requirement when placing a letterbox, inside or outside.<br/>

<br/>
Now this whole thread has made me laugh.  Anyone who halfway knows Silver<br/>
Eagle knows that - first and foremost - he isn't a sucker for an easy box.<br/>
And secondly, they know that he and his brother, Baby Bear, are in large<br/>
part responsible for letterboxing getting started in Texas by planting many<br/>
boxes all over the state along nice hikes and remote trails.  And in fact,<br/>
he and Baby Bear have taken off for a long weekend trip to venture into as<br/>
yet unboxed territory here in the Lone Star State to plant boxes (and I'm<br/>
betting the pub box or drive by box will be a scarcity amongst the ones they<br/>
plant) and find what precious few are already there.  And lastly, they would<br/>
know that Silver Eagle hardly avoids a reasonable debate, but he rarely<br/>
makes more than a comment on flawed leaps of logic.<br/>

Eagle's examples.  There are probably a lot of good examples of creative<br/>
indoor boxes -- those weren't two of 'em.<br/>
<br/>
However, Springchick's ideas that an indoor box can be made nicer by a<br/>
placer since it's indoors and out of the elements.........to me that's just<br/>
drive-by postal letterboxing.  Creative indoor clues would be a different<br/>
story however.  But I've seen precious few clues in this area that are<br/>
creative for indoor boxes.  Generally the clues merely consist of walking up<br/>
to a counter and giving out a password or waiting for the waitress and<br/>
giving him/her a password.  There's one in a used bookstore in this area<br/>
that's much more creative with clues.  Maybe will go find it one of these<br/>
days, if it's still there, but I prefer the outside elements.   Indoors I<br/>
feel lazy........that's just me.<br/>
<br/>
But when someone on this list -- this particular list of all places :-) --<br/>
attempts to say that they *resent* something, or that they're *offended* by<br/>
something, to me that's like nails on a<br/>
blackboard.............whine.......whine..........whiiiiiine.<br/>

State your case.  Fergitabout the 'Ooooooh, I soooooooo resent ______ (fill<br/>

apple pie with their beer, presents Mom, and posts about how wonderful the<br/>
offended person is.  :-)<br/>

Your post made ya thirsty, eh? Yes, by all means, go do some letterboxing<br/>
and buy some rounds. Buy a few of them. Remember to bring along a<br/>
designated driver tho please. Nah, you don't want to debate it. Debating<br/>
uses brain cells. Much easier to go find some easy boxes by buying 10<br/>
people a round and let the brain cells die in the alcohol. As I said, to<br/>
each his/her own.<br/>
*************************<br/>
<br/>
Now this whole thread has made me laugh.  Anyone who halfway knows Silver<br/>
Eagle knows that - first and foremost - he isn't a sucker for an easy box.<br/>
And secondly, they know that he and his brother, Baby Bear, are in large<br/>
part responsible for letterboxing getting started in Texas by planting many<br/>
boxes all over the state along nice hikes and remote trails.  And in fact,<br/>
he and Baby Bear have taken off for a long weekend trip to venture into as<br/>
yet unboxed territory here in the Lone Star State to plant boxes (and I'm<br/>
betting the pub box or drive by box will be a scarcity amongst the ones they<br/>
plant) and find what precious few are already there.  And lastly, they would<br/>
know that Silver Eagle hardly avoids a reasonable debate, but he rarely<br/>
makes more than a comment on flawed leaps of logic.<br/>

&gt; Ask any letterboxer from Texas to name the one person they respect<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; most in letterboxing.  Nine times out of ten, the answer will be<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Silver Eagle.  That would be my answer as well.<br/>
