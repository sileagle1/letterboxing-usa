What an interesting tempest! I am new to this interactive site, and seem to have joined right at the moment of high commenting! My mailbox usually has half this many deliveries! I keep 'hearing' the teacher clapping her hands for the squabling children to quiet down and pay attention....LOL.. and please laugh with me here.....<br/>
Remember that the written word leaves out the inflection and tone that a voice may provide, thus the possible beginnings for misunderstandings. So, let's all take a deep breath and quit reacting. No offense meant, and no offense taken. OK???<br/>
I have been quite impressed with the pictures and descriptions of Lb events that have occurred, although I have never had the chance to attend one yet. I look forward to the day that I am near one and able to play. Yes, there are times I've been a bit frustrated with ambiguous clues, possibly lost boxes, situations that may be less than ideal for me personally, etc. But that's all part of this hobby.... it's my choice where I go, and I'm not restricted by a date. I've learned by experience to carry my bug spray, sunblock, road map, compass, hiking and waterproof shoes, sunglasses, broad brimmed hat, binoculars, camera, blah, blah, blah....I suspect you may have had similar experiences! And I love learning!<br/>
For the last several years, I have been content to Lb for the fun of the chase. I even enjoy just reading the many clues online, some are imaginative and hilarious, ex. Bubba Quixote's Golden Acorn, N. MS (which I did get the chance to visit!). I personally haven't kept count of the number of found Lb and I have no artistic talent to create a stamp. I'm not imaginative enough to create these adorable Lb gatherings, although I'd be one of the great assistants to your ideas. At this time in my life, I am very appreciative how much I am getting for what little I've been able to contribute, but that was never one of the requirements. I am thrilled to learn about all the other ideas that your emails have presented, things I have not thought of by myself. I am overwhelmed by all those individuals that have carved and created and found the most wonderful, interesting and beautiful places for me to discover. I get to wander, discover, experience, collect, take pictures, and just revel in the<br/>
 beauty of places I may never have seen otherwise. I don't feel dishonored for not being able to do as much as many others have! It's my choice and I thank you all for that. My brother and I have reconnected through our mutual interest in Lb!<br/>
So....Thanks to all the carvers and placers in the world! Thanks to all who have developed these interactive sites, who ask questions, and who've given many suggestions, answers, presented new ideas and masterminded huge gatherings of strangers with one thing in common! Thanks to those who wish to honor individuals that they feel like honoring - now theres' a concept the whole world should embrace! Hug, everyone, HUG!<br/>
I look forward to the day I get to meet and greet you as MY Fellow Letterboxers!<br/>
If you really feel offended by anything I have written, please accept my sincerest apologies without further ado, and <br/>
Keep smiling :-)<br/>
Kathy, temporarily in MS, formerly of CO, moving to SC this month! Hope to see you there!<br/>

really suspected that NO ONE in our community would find that <br/>

ours, it is sometimes those who do the least that complain the most! <br/>
I hope that is not the case, but just know that here we are honoring <br/>
those whose actions speak louder than their words - not the "would be <br/>
kings"  who would like to get "instant fame" without doing ALL the <br/>
hard work of earning it, but those we feel truly deserve it!!!<br/>
