missing from its location; HOWEVER, we spotted the letterbox afloat <br/>
in the brook below the metal bridge! Chances are someone tossed it in <br/>
there; as the Farmington River was not that high to have floated it <br/>
away.  We'll try to retrieve it once that Brook dries up a bit (ok, <br/>
well with this rain, it may be a while!). But it does dry in summer <br/>
months.  We hope to replant it with maybe a slightly adjusted <br/>
location.<br/>
