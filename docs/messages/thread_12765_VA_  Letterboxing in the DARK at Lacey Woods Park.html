were "fortified" to pursue more letterboxes despite the night hours.  <br/>
My co-conspirator is a night owl after all.  So we headed for <br/>
Arlington and Lacey Woods Park.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been letterboxing at night before and I am sure many of you <br/>
have but how often have you been letterboxing in the DARK?  We <br/>
discovered we had no flashlight!  Hey, the parks not that big, how <br/>
hard can it be?  It was dark.  <br/>
<br/>
We walked back out of the park to the streetlights a couple times to <br/>
reread the clues.  Then night owl discovered she could use her cell <br/>
phone button lights to read by.  Wouldn't light up the trail though.  <br/>
We found the holly tree by feel.  Literally.  That's right.  "Ouch! <br/>
Yep, that's a holly tree."  <br/>
<br/>
Vague shapes in the dark.  At one point I said hello to a stump <br/>
thinking it was night owl down low to look at something.  I think I <br/>
found "2003 Year" more by letterboxing placing instinct, and feel, <br/>
then by sight.  We went back to the car to stamp in.  At least it was <br/>
close to the road.  It sure was spooky putting it back by myself <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
"1533" was deeper in the woods.  "I thought this was a little <br/>
park?!"  For a little park we were sure led through a maze of little <br/>
trails in the dark.  "Is that a trail or a log?"  "Oww!"  "Must be a <br/>
log."  We punched our cell phones over and over to light up the <br/>
clues.  Do you know that clues are more incomprehensible and <br/>
everything seems so much farther in the dark?  I was shading my eyes <br/>
from far away porch lights through the trees to preserve my night <br/>
vision.<br/>
<br/>
Finding the great circle of benchs around the fire platform, in the <br/>
dark, was a spiritual experience.  Again I couldn't see most of the <br/>
objects in the clues and just read ahead and guessed.  So much for <br/>
reaching under logs carefully.  Can't use a stick in the dark.  But <br/>
you can feel a letterbox container.  "Ah ha!" <br/>
<br/>
Night Owl insisted we stamp in there at the picnic table in the <br/>
dark.  Someone called her on the cell phone asking if we'd just <br/>
called.  Night Owl must have been redialing someone accidently while <br/>
pushing buttons to get light.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoyed the stamps in both places.  Wish we could have seen how nice <br/>
the park was.  Though we did thoroughly enjoy the park, in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun and challenging and I can't believe I didn't get poison <br/>
ivy.  I can't say I recommend it.  Did I mention it was DARK?<br/>
