I'm finally getting a chance to post Wanda's most recent report on our web <br/>
page.  Between getting sidetracked by other projects, like gardening, and <br/>
then being slowed down by some health problems,  it took her awhile to get <br/>
around to writing it up.  It's still amazing to me, though, that she was able to <br/>
find so many boxes while on the road from mid-March to mid-April, driving <br/>
through parts of the country that until recently typically had very few <br/>
letterboxes!  Anyone interested in rejoicing along with us about this new <br/>
growth in letterboxing can read Wanda's story at<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
(It's a long one, though, so some of you may want to make a rest stop along <br/>
the way , or just take an exit now!)<br/>

has 'exploded' around this region.  It's amazing!  One thing I remember <br/>
is that we crossed paths with a couple of letterboxes on the same day <br/>
in March in New Orleans!  I was amazed that we were stamping in the <br/>
same day as you were--and we're both from opposite ends of the <br/>
country!  How fun!  Congratulations on the milestone(s)!!!<br/>

I got to meet her personally at a Spring boxing Drive in CT several weeks ago.  She and Pete are amazing people.  For someone who has found so many boxes, she knew exactly the ones I planted and the bonuses attached.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
