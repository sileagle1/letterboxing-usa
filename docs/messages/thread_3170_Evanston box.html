&gt;Hi everyone!<br/>
&gt;      I live in the Chicago area and found out about letterboxing <br/>
&gt;around  2 weeks ago. I have since carved my own stamp and found my <br/>
&gt;1st letterbox in Evanston, Illinois(north of Chi-town).Thanks <br/>
&gt;Rachel. It was really interesting, exciting, and fun. I will be <br/>
&gt;hiding some letterboxes near Chicagoland historical sites very soon. <br/>
&gt;I am working on stamps now. Happy letterboxing.<br/>
&gt;                 Tom<br/>

I am glad to hear the Evanston box is still there after all this <br/>
time. It was the first box I found years ago, and I think I was the <br/>
first one to stamp in there. Too bad I won't be back in Chicago <br/>
anytime soon to find the one's you are hiding.<br/>

I think Rachel relocated the box to it's current site quite a while <br/>
ago. When I found it, it was in some rocks along the shore of the <br/>
lake. It certainly would not have survived the lake weather there for <br/>
3 years. Glad to hear it is still safe. I'll have to try to find it <br/>
again sometime in it's current placement whenever I get back to <br/>
Chicago. I wonder if that would "officially" count as another find? <br/>
;-)<br/>
