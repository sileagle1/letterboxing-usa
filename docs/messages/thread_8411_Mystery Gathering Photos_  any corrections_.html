                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well I finally managed to upload the photos that I have of the<br/>
Mystery <br/>
Gathering.  I put them in the Mystery gathering album created by <br/>
Linda.  The quality of them varies, depending on whether or not it<br/>
was <br/>
raining when they were taken.  Please advise me of any <br/>
misidentifications.  As others have said, you will have to sign into <br/>
the letterboxing site before you can got to the Photos link and open <br/>
the album.  Enjoy<br/>
