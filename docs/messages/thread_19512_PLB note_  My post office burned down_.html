                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I found out later that it didn't burn down, but there was a bad <br/>
fire at the post office.  From what I hear some guy that was not <br/>
entirely with it decided he needed to pour gasoline down the mail <br/>
slots inside the local post office and then set a match to it.  I've <br/>
been told that a lot of the mail in my town was lost.  Several days <br/>
later, they did get the office up again, but the thought occured to <br/>
me that I better check to see if anyone sent postal boxes. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone sent me anything recently and has not heard from me yet, <br/>
please write so that I can look out for it and confirm delivery.<br/>
