Series: Zodiac<br/>
By: Doublesaj  (doublesaj@aol.com)<br/>
Name: Francis Ford "Copia"-Aries Microbox<br/>
Place: Napa, California<br/>
Difficulty rating: Step out of your car<br/>
<br/>
This is the first in what hopefully will be a 12 box series, one for each <br/>
sign of the Zodiac. I promised this to be in the Davis-Sacramento, Ca area <br/>
but signed up for a day-trip to "Copia Center for Food, Wine and The Arts" <br/>
and learned that one of the major contributors to this beautiful center is <br/>
Francis For Coppola, born April 7, 1939--a typically pioneering, ardent and <br/>
fiery ARIES! Couldn't resist planting it here.<br/>
<br/>
Copia is a beautiful building and grounds and if you have an extra $12.50 in <br/>
your pocket, spend the day there viewing the many galleries and listen to the <br/>
lectures and tour the gardens. A couple blocks away is the downtown Napa <br/>
Center with wonderful shopping!<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Get to Napa and go east on First Street. You can't miss the <br/>
beautiful Copia building. It's large parking lot in front is free. <br/>
<br/>
In the front line of parking where the blue handicapped signs are, there is a <br/>
gate at the far, left side that appears to be open all the time. It's next to <br/>
an adjoining residence. Walk straight through that gate and you'll see a <br/>
paved walking path that takes you east, between the river and the back side <br/>
of Copia. DON'T TAKE THAT PATH! Instead, upon going through the gate, proceed <br/>
directly forward and down the side of the hill toward the river. The grass <br/>
and brush is unkempt compared to the rest of Copia's grounds but easily <br/>
forged (it looks better than MY yard!) About 6 feet down the hill from the <br/>
path, there's a little sign that points toward the river--probably says NO <br/>
TRESPASSING, I didn't look. It's only about 12" off the ground, just peeking <br/>
over the grass around it. <br/>
<br/>
The microbox is at the base of that sign, hidden by the grass. BTW: this is <br/>
my very first, self-carved stamp. I now feel I'm 'officially' a letterboxer!<br/>
