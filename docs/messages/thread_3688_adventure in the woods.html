                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had an interesting adventure yesterday while hiking in the woods.  I<br/>
was in an unfamiliar area and the trail was sketchy at best.  So with<br/>
relative ease I got myself up the mountain.  It was coming back down<br/>
that I ran into trouble.  I thought I was going the right way, but it<br/>
became quite evident that that was not the case.  After about an hour<br/>
from desending the peak I became quite unsure of my surroundings.  I<br/>
finally said it is time to get some help.  So now here starts the<br/>
adventure.  911 connects me to the State Police who then contact the<br/>
local rangers.  Ranger Black then calls me on my cell and tries to<br/>
figure out my approximate location.  After speaking to him my fears<br/>
eased, because at least now I know someone was looking for me.  I had<br/>
food and water so that wasn't a problem.  Anyway, he kept trying to<br/>
locate me by sounding his sirens, but I was too far away to hear them.<br/>
Then they had a firetruck sound it's siren, but still nothing.  After<br/>
about 2 hours my cell phone battery was dying and the sun was going<br/>
down.  They finally had a fix on my location so they directed me to walk<br/>
a certain direction according to my shadow.  A helecopter was brought in<br/>
to help me direct myself to them.  Good thing I knew enough about E W N<br/>
S to direct the copter to hover over my position.  In a matter of<br/>
minutes I came crashing out of the woods to salvation.  The rescue was a<br/>
success and I was very grateful for their assistance.  After all was<br/>
said and done one of the firefighters asked me if I had ever been there<br/>
before.  The obvious answer was of course "no".  He told me that that<br/>
particular mountain was round and that no matter where I came down I<br/>
would hit a road.  It may not have been by the car, but it would have<br/>
been a road.<br/>
So the moral of this story is, if at all possible know a little bit<br/>
about the area you are hiking and bring survival stuff.<br/>
Please understand that this is just a telling of a story and does not<br/>
require tons of postings about safety proceedures and the like.  This<br/>
has never happened to me before and I certainly hope it is the last<br/>
time.  I just want to let the list know that the rescures were a great<br/>
bunch of guys and I thank them very much in their persistance in finding<br/>
me even though I was only @ a 1/2 mile from my car.  :-)<br/>

Happy Trails<br/>

I was trying to plant one. :-)  It is planted and in a great place.  Now<br/>
I just have to CAREFULLY find my way back up there to make up some<br/>
clues.  Next time I'm going with a partner. :-)<br/>

No, Ranger Black was a bit to old for me, however a couple of the<br/>
firefighters were definitely easy on the eyes.  lol<br/>
