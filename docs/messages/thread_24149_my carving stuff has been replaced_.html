                    <div class="plaintext-content"> I was notified today that Misterart.com will replace all the stuff that had<br/>
been lost recently in the mail. I did get it back from a neighbor but<br/>
Misterart.com said to not return anything and that the other carving blocks<br/>
are on the way! I am so psyched!!  I want to plug Misterart.com and say they<br/>
have super customer service. they got right on the case asap and fixed the<br/>
problem and even when the problem was solved they treated me like gold<br/>
anyway. very cool. :)<br/>
