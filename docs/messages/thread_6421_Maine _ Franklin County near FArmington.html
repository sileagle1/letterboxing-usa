Weld, Maine   Franklin county  near Farmington<br/>

Easy under a mile but can stay on trail for 2 miles .<br/>
<br/>
( I HAVE MISPLACED MY CLUES AND WILL UPDATE THIS WHEN I LOCATE THEM.....THIS IS FROM MEMORY)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Follow the signs to Mt. Blue State Park in Weld , MAine <br/>
Once in the park .....find a  spot to park your car in the main gate area. The entrance to Swettbrook Trail is near the gate , which is back towards the way you came in ( a very short distance away from the  parking lot).<br/>
3 large Rocks guard the entrance to the trail. Follow this moss covered path and you will soon find a dirt road .<br/>
turn right and head over the plank bridge.<br/>
Directly over the bridge on the left is the SwettBrook path.enter .<br/>
The trail is well marked with bright orange boundary markers as the property that abutts the park is being sold.<br/>
The trees along the trail were also well marked.<br/>
You will cross over the brook many times and there are many planks to make your journey easier. Soon the brook will be on your left.<br/>
Also of interest are 3 geological,topographic markers along the  trail.<br/>
your treasure is hidden in a stone wall on the right side of the trail behind a tree with 3 sisters. there is a geographical/topographic marker  ( US 106) here.<br/>
Stamp and rehide and continue to the paved road. you can either cross the street and continue on the path for a total of 2 miles or you can turn left on the paved road and head back to the parking lot. <br/>
