Here is the message from the non-boxer:<br/>
<br/>
Hi,<br/>
<br/>
    My family and I were at the Okefenokee Swamp yesterday and we <br/>
found the Pogo Box in the camelia garden.  We were not familiar with <br/>
letterboxing at all, so we didn't really know what to do.  I signed <br/>
all our names, our city, and the date we found it (Sun, 06/13/2004).  <br/>
Then I re-hid it....<br/>
<br/>
We were evidently the first ones to find it.<br/>
<br/>
It is now at the front entrance at the main sign up under the whiskey <br/>
barrell.  If you are in the parking lot facing the gift shop it will <br/>
be the whiskey barrell on the RIGHT.  Just wanted you to know where <br/>
it was in case we should have put it back where we originally found <br/>
it........<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I've copied your post to the letterbox-Southeast site as well. Maybe <br/>
someone from south Georgia or northern Florida will check on it. I <br/>
would hate to see this box go missing. You may be right about the log <br/>
book, which would be a shame. <br/>
