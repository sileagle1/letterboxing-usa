                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agreee we should be careful with the media.  Recently, we had <br/>
reporters emailing group members and posting on our southeast list. I <br/>
guess what we also need to consider is do we comply and let more <br/>
experienced boxers do the talking or chance them getting their hands <br/>
on a newbie that doesn't have a full understanding of the "boxing <br/>
experience". Call it damage control I guess but it may be one way for <br/>
us to control what is shared about letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
Growth is nice, but a slow progression is going to be better in the <br/>
long run.  Boxing has exploded here in Georgia. We are concerned but <br/>
we also recognize that with some it will blow over when the next fad <br/>
shows up in a magazine or tv program.  For the others, the quality <br/>
boxes will last.<br/>
<br/>
All we can do is prepare for the worst and hope for the best.<br/>
