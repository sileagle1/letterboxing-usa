                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all! Or is that y'all? I'm a native Washingtonian soon to be <br/>
moving to the Hattiesburg, MS area. We expect to be settled there by <br/>
mid February. I'd love to do a mini meet in the MS-LA area provided <br/>
it isn't too far away, so if you do it in February you'll have one <br/>
more (or 4 more if the whole family comes!).<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say hello to you few (compared to here!) MS and LA <br/>
letterboxers. We plan on hiding some boxes, in fact I have 2 ready to <br/>
go now, and we haven't even moved yet! But we like best to find them, <br/>
so anything that gets more people planting boxes in the area is great.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Alright Cami.  It's Steve the guy you emailed.  I'm going to email J. <br/>
Dillon and try to get something planned.  I'm so glad to hear you <br/>
already have some to put out.  I'm also working on some that should <br/>
be ready to hide by Jan.  I have 7 out there now, replacing 1 and 8 <br/>
coming soon.  <br/>
