letterboxes simultaneously.  Even the sprays are still only a cover, <br/>
and like air fresheners, they last for a bit and you are still left <br/>
with the underlying scent.<br/>
<br/>
It is amazing how food smells can rub off and even pull into the <br/>
plastic.  I had a bunch of stamps in process on my dining room table <br/>
and made fish one night.  The whole house smelled like fish for 3 <br/>
days.  I know it sounds crazy to think that the smell pulled into the <br/>
rubber of the stamps, but every single one of those boxes was <br/>
attacked by critters once I put them out, and that is not something I <br/>
have had happen but only once or twice before.<br/>

Another boxer here in MI was telling me just the other day how he had <br/>
checked in on a local box (not one of his) and it had been chewed <br/>
through but good.  Apparently someone had left some "goodies" inside <br/>

I had to let out my best  EEEEEW!  when we found a geocache here in RI that had candy and gum in it.  They were so wet and yucky, and the box wreaked of sugar.  We traded some money for the goodies and threw the sweets away.  (We don't carry cache-y stuff, normally, but we did have plenty of Dunkin' Donuts napkins, some wipes, and spare change.)  Good thing that most of the animals around there are college party animals, but still, we may have saved one of them from themselves. ;-)  The squirrels, skunks or other creatures probably wouldn't have eaten anything, just torn the box to shreds.  College students have been known to eat just about anything...<br/>

While stamping in, a friend of mine heard a deep snort and turned around to be face to face with a huge buck.  If I remember correctly, he stared her down for a while and then abruptly left.  And soon afterward she began to breathe and move again, I'm sure, because she's still with us today. <s> I wonder if she would have been so lucky with attractant on the box.  I don't know much about attractants and animals in rut, but I wouldn't take any chances.<br/>
<br/>
Mothballs are said to discourage skunks but I've heard from a neighbor that they just ignore them and keep coming, anyway.  Worth a try, though, if they aren't dangerous to animals or the environment.<br/>

  There's spray you can buy that hunters use that removes all odor. I<br/>

&gt; While stamping in, a friend of mine heard a deep snort and turned <br/>
around to be face to face with a huge buck.  If I remember correctly, <br/>
he stared her down for a while and then abruptly left.  And soon <br/>
afterward she began to breathe and move again, I'm sure, because <br/>
she's still with us today. <s> I wonder if she would have been so <br/>
lucky with attractant on the box.  I don't know much about <br/>
attractants and animals in rut, but I wouldn't take any chances.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mothballs are said to discourage skunks but I've heard from a <br/>
neighbor that they just ignore them and keep coming, anyway.  Worth a <br/>
try, though, if they aren't dangerous to animals or the environment.<br/>

&gt;   There's spray you can buy that hunters use that removes all odor. <br/>
I<br/>
&gt;   think the doe-in-rut stuff draws in all the "ahem" interested male<br/>
&gt;   deer to the spot.<br/>
