Difficulty: Clues-2, Physical-1.5<br/>

General notes: Please take your own stamp pad(s). Ohio's climate is <br/>
not <br/>
conducive to stamp pad durability. Seeker of Flags' pace count is <br/>
19.5 <br/>
paces (double steps) per 100 feet. Degree of difficulty is on a 5 <br/>
point <br/>
scale. Please e-mail me at the address above with any complaints, <br/>
suggestions, or information about the status and condition of the <br/>
Letterbox. No dogs are allowed on the Park's trails.<br/>
Use the Indian Ridge entrance off Kropp Rd. south of Alkire Rd. The <br/>
first <br/>
parking lot on the left. Use the parking spaces to check your pace <br/>
count <br/>
against mine. It takes me 21 paces to walk across 10 parking places.<br/>
Take path leading southwest from small picnic area. Go to path <br/>
junction and <br/>
turn right. Don't take the "old" path to the left. Follow the main <br/>
trail, <br/>
ignoring small connecting paths on right that lead back out to picnic <br/>
areas.<br/>
Continue on path until junction; follow signs for Terrace Trail. Up a <br/>
large <br/>
hill with a resting place at the top. Continue on the trail in the <br/>
same <br/>
direction until you come to a road.<br/>
Cross the road and start counting:<br/>
170 paces to a culvert pipe across trail<br/>
50 paces to a culvert pipe across trail<br/>
50 paces to a culvert pipe across trail<br/>
270 paces to a culvert pipe across trail<br/>
35 more paces<br/>
STOP! Look straight ahead - Its a dodecafurcated self-contained copse.<br/>
14 more paces and you're there. Look behind it.<br/>
A convenient catching feature follows. A gate marked "Area Closed Do <br/>
Not <br/>
Enter". Turn around and go back 70 paces if you missed it the first <br/>
time.<br/>
