trees are down on the trails (due to Isabel), but they are passable. <br/>
Here are the clues, which are also posted on the LbNA site. Happy <br/>
hunting!<br/>
<br/>
Hills of Hunt Valley<br/>
<br/>
This series of three boxes resides in Oregon Ridge Park in central <br/>
Baltimore County. To get to the park, proceed on Interstate 83 North <br/>
to Hunt Valley. Take the Shawan Road West exit and go about a mile or <br/>
so until you come to a light. Make a left onto Beaver Dam Rd., and <br/>
then make a quick right to go to the park. Do not turn into the <br/>
Oregon Grille restaurant parking. Also, do not go to the second park <br/>
entrance further down Beaver Dam Rd, since this will not lead to the <br/>
boxes. Once you drive into the park, proceed to the parking lot and <br/>
park. Walk to the Nature Center, which is located past the parking <br/>
lot. It's a nice little building with lots of info on the park. The <br/>
trail to the boxes begins here.<br/>
<br/>
"Maple"<br/>
The park is full of maples trees, from which syrup and candy are made <br/>
annually and sold at the Nature Center. <br/>
