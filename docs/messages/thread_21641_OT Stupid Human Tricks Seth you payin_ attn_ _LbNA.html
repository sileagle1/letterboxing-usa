I can write backwards and upside down at the same time. Not as fast as I write normally, but still at a fairly good pace. Oh, and I can cross my eyes and rotate them around independently from each other. <gg><br/>

  Now that I have been thoroughly entertained with the recent posts, I'd like to say I am able   to write in mirror image as fast as I can in "normal" direction, and it is very legible.  It's not something I practice, I comes quite naturally.  ... I am left-handed most of the time, but again, I can write with my right hand, not well.  Help me dispel the ignorance!<br/>

  Seth, maybe you should be talking to Letterbug and Speedsquare about going to Vegas.  I can also write with both hands at the same time, but it has to be the same text.  And I've always been very good with patterns and trends, esp. ones that many people don't normally see.  <br/>
