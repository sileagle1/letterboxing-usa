                    <div class="plaintext-content">Maybe the spot could be changed to "All things unconsidered" or "All stuff considered" or "All things considerededed" to remove discomfort about it.  But I highly doubt the NPR people are going after Mr. Rayvenhaus anytime soon, so no need to get overly excited.... he's not exactly making any money on this, just offering a service, and money is pretty much where it's at!  He also did not use the copyright or TM or other symbol, so it should be clear to anyone that there's no false pretense going on.  The actual phrase "all things considered", like most common phrases, cannot be owned by anyone in and of itself. Only if a person were trying to trick someone into thinking they were representing NPR, or making money off this title, or using their symbols after it, would NPR care about it.  In the music world, we run into this all the time.  We can play pieces at a given venue, even though they were written or arranged by others.  We give the composer credit, and money-making venues pay ASCAP fees, etc. Otherwise, if we play gratis for some non-profit event, it's a moot point.  We still mention the composer if appropriate, but no royalties happen because no money was made. However, when we've recorded others' compositions, they get credit and tune royalties on every CD we sell.  If it's played on the radio, &amp; the tune is listed with BMI, the composer gets the royalties too. Turning someone else's invention into your own profit w/o giving credit due, is where the catch is.    --lunaryakketyact<br/>

I disagree.  How about "Just Do It"?  Or "Fright Fest"?  The United States has<br/>
commercial trademark laws, and they don't equate to music copyright laws.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ... using their symbols after it, would NPR care about it.  <br/>
<br/>
Why wouldn't NPR care?  They spend a lot of money to promote and perform their<br/>
programming.  Dilution of their trademarked phrase can hardly be in their best<br/>
interest in any way.  Why wouldn't they spend some money to protect their<br/>
investment?<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I would just come up with an original name instead of blatantly<br/>
using a known trademarked name.  <br/>

This is true.   Even if they don't care about this particular use, they have <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, the difference is because it's all about MONEY--- we aren't making any money when we use the phrase "all things considered" or "just do it"; we use them all the time. The fact that they show up in an email or as a discussion subject line on a website is only going to bother the powers that be, if someone is truly ripping them off financially or mis-representing themselves by using the trademark symbols after the name.  Otherwise they aren't going to spend good money getting concerned about it.  There are hundreds of enterprises (money-making ones) that have the same group name we have, simply because it's a common &amp; popular name, but none of them are going after eachother because there's no intention to rip one another off.  Now if Rayvenhaus would try to name a whole website "All Things Considered" and pretend he was part of that NPR organization &amp; use the symbols, logos, etc. it would be a whole different story.  <br/>
<br/>
I was trying to make the point that a common phrase like this can't truly be owned SO completely that when it shows up somewhere, the company's going to get up in arms.  And if they are actually getting more notice because of the way you used their name, they have no reason to stop you.  Music laws are actually quite strict too, in fact that's what much of the legalistic email was about...using music &amp; interviews from the show.  Yes, if Rayvenhaus put music from All Songs Considered on his site, there would be problems because those music groups would want payment.  Again, it's all about money. Most of us have been at least as guilty as this when we make Xeroxes, scans, faxes, etc. of all kinds of copyrighted things. Few people even think twice about it, but at the same time they are rarely going out and selling them.  -lunaryakketyact<br/>

Thank you Wes, my point exactly. One of the (many) reasons that I like the options <br/>
that this hobby entails. Mostly for the creative person, originality is the name of the <br/>
game. This comes down to stamp designs, clue writing, etc. etc. on down the list. <br/>
In general I just abhor mediocrity. <br/>

Since this possible trademark violation would be a private matter <br/>
between NPR and the party (Mr. R) that owns the web site then I <br/>
think it would be a great idea to test the case. It would not have <br/>
any impact on LBNA or the main chatlist so I see no reason why <br/>
anyone should be concerned, that is anyone other than the parties <br/>
envolved.<br/>

If others of you are tired of people being humiliated here, please speak up.  I'm tired of it and I haven't even been here long.  I think it makes the newer people wonder whether it is related to some kind of past history on here, and yet part of me doesn't even want to know. It does start to look like a way to send people packing.  Whatever history is or was, this is not the solution to it. If people are disgruntled with eachother, it could be worked out in private.  Honestly, I doubt if any of us are completely free from guilt of using someone's intellectual property, knowingly or unknowingly, at some point in our lives.  If it were such a problem to NPR, they could probably handle it, and it's quite possible they have huger fish to fry!  If, as Mr. Rayvenhaus says, the name is going to change, that's fine... but good grief, let's lighten up!  I don't understand what is so threatening about a website or about a little mistake in judgment.  Let's give letterboxing a chance.  Right now we're putting a very unpleasant facade on it.  I still have hope that it (the tone of some of the dialogue here) can change, but it's going to take some maturity all around.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, Tara-- I don't know if you got your answer about NPR; didn't see one.  At the risk of thinking you were serious when you may not have been, I will answer. ( It's not always easy to be sure of a person's tone on here, or in emails, especially if it might be sarcasm)  Anyway, NPR is National Public Radio, and All Things... is a news-type program in which just about any subject is fair game.  If you haven't listened to news coverage on NPR, it will be a different scoop from whatever you are used to.  You can catch BBC on there too (British Broadcasting Corp.)  NPR needs listeners like you....  ;o)  they were just doing a fund drive. Looking forward to going back to real letterboxing news, folks.  --lunaryakketyact<br/>

<br/>
very well said! my sentiments also. a lot of the posts here either are or<br/>
are on the verge of humiliation. and i also am tired of it. i hesitate to<br/>
recommend this group to anyone seeking out information on letterboxing.<br/>
there are some marvelous posts on here and i have gained a lot of insight. i<br/>
like to think it is only a select few and not the majority that speaks this<br/>
way. it is a big world out there plenty of room for all of us. let the past<br/>
die and enjoy the mystery, suspense, elation (feel free to put in your own<br/>
adjective) of letterboxing and life itself. <br/>

I think part of the reason Phyto placed this post on the big list was <br/>
that there had been another instance last year of a gathering having <br/>
the name "Fright Fest". Six-FLags uses that name as an event that it <br/>
promotes  and Six Flags decided to make a huge deal out of it by <br/>
sending letters (from what we hear) to the list owner and to Steve of <br/>
Rayvenhaus. I think that perhaps (?) Phyto wanted to remind everyone <br/>
to be very cautious of using corporate logos, slogans, and other <br/>
assorted goodies as titles of events, columns, and boxes. I doubt <br/>
that Phyto was personally attacking Steve, just providing a friendly <br/>
reminder that others do indeed take notice and that we must be a bit <br/>
more attentive. <br/>

My time on the web has shown me that some people seem to live to <br/>

anonymity of the 'net. Emailing privately, which would be more <br/>
likely to acheive the supposed goal of correcting or informing <br/>
someone, doesn't give the hostile parties the unique combination of <br/>
anonymity and audience they seem to need. When these kind of people <br/>
become vocal on a list and there is not moderation to buffer it, <br/>
there is not much option for the people who prefer pleasant <br/>
discussion but to go elsewhere.  <br/>
<br/>
A separate list has been created for my state which is small, <br/>
friendly, supportive, and sticks to the topic.  Hopefully lists <br/>
exist for other states, or you could create one for your own!<br/>

I don't think that there is hostility towards the creation of a new <br/>
letterboxing web site, but I do believe many folks get pretty tired <br/>
of the daily onslaught of posts pushing alternate web sites. I have <br/>
attempted off list communications with some owners of the alternate <br/>
sites and in some cases have been met with very nasty responses. <br/>
When I have discussed the ethics of advertising one's web site,data <br/>
base or chat list(with every post) on this chat list , the <br/>
communication turn sour. When I have responses that get nasty then I <br/>
cease private discussions. I'm fairly sure others have received like <br/>
comunications and that leaves open discussions on this list or no <br/>
discussion at all. That certainly is an alternative that some folks <br/>
have opted for as they no longer post on this list.<br/>
<br/>
If you return to Phyto's original post, you will find nothing "she" <br/>
wrote that was wrong. I believe the trademark warning included was a <br/>
tad much, but she didn't write it. It should have been used in total <br/>
if it is used at all. You may have read "hostility" into the post, <br/>
but that certainly isn't Phytos problem. You may have read sarcasm <br/>
that may or may not have been there, as it is most difficult to <br/>
discern in written text.<br/>

The solution to everything....<br/>
<br/>
Visit www.groups.yahoo.com<br/>
Sign in to letterbox-usa<br/>
Click on 'edit my membership'<br/>
<br/>
Then either <br/>
<br/>
A- Click on 'No E-Mail' and 'Save Changes' to read only posts with<br/>
intriquing subject lines when online and at the list. Your mailbox<br/>
will ne'er o'erflow again.<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
B- Click on 'Leave Group' and never be bothered again.<br/>
<br/>
I bristle at the thought of moderation and being limited to what I am<br/>
'allowed' to say.  So I simply ignore outre-imposed boundaries and say<br/>
what I like within self-imposed restrictions. Flame me. I'm already<br/>
flaming anyhoo.<br/>

How dare you insult our ability to accessorize! Her Ladyship can <br/>
tolerate the slings and arrows of the little people who envy her, <br/>
but to insult our fashion sense is beyond the pale. Her Ladyship has <br/>
never been so offended in all her spectacular life. That you should <br/>
attempt to impose your "taste" on her Ladyship is to carry it too <br/>
far. Such hostility is intolerable and her Ladyship for one will not <br/>
take it lying down on her lovely hand woven Italian silk erminissimo <br/>
duvet cover from the Antico Setificio Fiorentino. No, indeed not. <br/>
Her Ladyship shall see to it that your footwear is mocked at every <br/>
turn. You shall never show your ill-coifed head in any of the more <br/>
respectable letterboxing locations unbowed or unashamed. You have <br/>
simply ruined my enthusiasm for tasteful boxing attire. I hope that <br/>
you are pleased with yourself. <br/>

&gt; The unpleasantness baffles me, too.  Why such vehemence?  Why throw <br/>
the whole book at someone for the whole list to read?  If others of <br/>
you are tired of people being humiliated here, please speak up.  I'm <br/>
tired of it and I haven't even been here long.  I think it makes the <br/>
newer people wonder whether it is related to some kind of past <br/>
history on here, and yet part of me doesn't even want to know. It <br/>
does start to look like a way to send people packing.  Whatever <br/>
history is or was, this is not the solution to it. If people are <br/>
disgruntled with eachother, it could be worked out in private.  <br/>
Honestly, I doubt if any of us are completely free from guilt of <br/>
using someone's intellectual property, knowingly or unknowingly, at <br/>
some point in our lives.  If it were such a problem to NPR, they <br/>
could probably handle it, and it's quite possible they have huger <br/>
fish to fry!  If, as Mr. Rayvenhaus says, the name is going to <br/>
change, that's fine... but good grief, let's lighten up!  I don't <br/>
understand what is so threatening about a website or about a little <br/>
mistake in judgment.  Let's give letterboxing a chance.  Right now <br/>
we're putting a very unpleasant facade on it.  I still have hope that <br/>
it (the tone of some of the dialogue here) can change, but it's going <br/>
to take some maturity all around.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, Tara-- I don't know if you got your answer about NPR; didn't <br/>
see one.  At the risk of thinking you were serious when you may not <br/>
have been, I will answer. ( It's not always easy to be sure of a <br/>
person's tone on here, or in emails, especially if it might be <br/>
sarcasm)  Anyway, NPR is National Public Radio, and All Things... is <br/>
a news-type program in which just about any subject is fair game.  If <br/>
you haven't listened to news coverage on NPR, it will be a different <br/>
scoop from whatever you are used to.  You can catch BBC on there too <br/>
(British Broadcasting Corp.)  NPR needs listeners like you....  ;o)  <br/>
they were just doing a fund drive. Looking forward to going back to <br/>
real letterboxing news, folks.  --lunaryakketyact<br/>

I've recently become moderator of a yahoo group for 12-18 year olds, and that was the list I thought would act like this. But istead it appears to people with family's or are roughly in their middle ages. Let's stop all of this please and set a good example for your children.<br/>
