tot. Now my favorite endearment to everyone is "Hon"..embarrassed <br/>
myself a few times though.  Once I replied to a fellow (male) teacher <br/>
who had a question, with "What was that, hon?".  Actually a second <br/>
favorite term is "Kiddo" when speaking to my students.  It's odd but <br/>
no one has complained yet..plus there are "Hon"s sprinkled in now and <br/>
then, with of course, each student's individual name used often. <br/>
