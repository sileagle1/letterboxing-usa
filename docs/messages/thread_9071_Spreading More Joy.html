Celebration, I am able to report an "eggsceptional" day of fun and <br/>
frivolity! <br/>
     First I'd like to thank the waiters and the managers of the <br/>
restaraunt for their patience with our noisy group and we were smack <br/>
dab in the middle of the place. I know they will get this thanks by <br/>
word of mouth, Princess of the day knows the owners. Cool place !!! <br/>
     It's so much fun meeting/putting faces to other letterboxers. <br/>
     As ADG said we split into 2 groups to go hunting. Our group went <br/>
to Patapsco State Park to do the Rockburn Trail. We found all 3 boxes <br/>
in good shape and we were the first to stamp in. When the clue <br/>
said  "as big as a Buick" he wasn't kidding. Thomas (Scarab) took a <br/>
picture of us next to the roots. Just to prove we were there. <br/>
     Tux, their black lab, is a great l'box finder, and had Beryl way <br/>
ahead of us all the time. <br/>
     The kids, David and Cozy, were real sports as we sent them off <br/>
trail to check if we where at the right spot.<br/>
     I enjoyed meeting all, Happy Trails,<br/>
