     The year was 1935, Bennett was the youngest child in the one <br/>
room schoolhouse. Times were tough due to the Great Depression. Many <br/>
families had left the area to find work elsewhere. Little Ben sat at <br/>
his desk daydreaming about catching frogs down in the hollow. He had <br/>
heard that the school would be closing soon. So why bother learnin'.<br/>
<br/>
    Take twenty two paces to the left of the front gate. Looking left <br/>
is an old large 2 in 1 tree with crisscrossed bark. Behind is your <br/>
find. Please rehide carefully. The End.<br/>

      The third jewel of the Triple Crown is the Belmont Stakes. <br/>
Although not a triple crown winner, Caveat did win this coveted race <br/>
in 1983. Jim Ryan was the owner of Caveat. Few knew he liked holly <br/>
trees.<br/>
