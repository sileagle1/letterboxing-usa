There are so many other things we can discuss - <br/>

How about talking about the first box you ever found?<br/>

And one more comment on this.  Every message gets deleted,<br/>
whether or not it makes it thru moderation (fortunately, a<br/>
handful aren't presently making past that point).  That is<br/>
simply more, pointless work for me as a result of every<br/>
message posted.  It also means, since most people read on<br/>
the web, that there are very few actual readers of these<br/>
messages at this point.  You are writing pointlessly, for<br/>
no one.  I recommend the work of Umberto Eco for further<br/>
exploration of this concept.<br/>
<br/>
So, please have some common courtesy and stop making more<br/>
work for me.  I'm very busy.  It is simple, common courtesy<br/>
for those who simply don't care about the issue or the<br/>
trollfest.<br/>
<br/>
For those writing about "positivity", keep in mind that this<br/>
is a big negative for me.  And I don't give a hoot one way or<br/>
the other whether or not the idea is implemented, lame, or a<br/>
hit.<br/>
<br/>
Note that I have had to delete _three_ messages in the moderation<br/>
queue just from Amber, _after_ she _acknowledged_ my _second_<br/>
declaration of the death of the thread.  This is my third and<br/>
final request Amber, 'Nuff said.<br/>
