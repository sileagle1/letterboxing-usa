when i found my first hitchhiker my second day into the chase, my <br/>
personal thoughts were ( without reading the entire lbna site)<br/>
<br/>
1. the HH owner would like to know what wild and crazy people had <br/>
seen and moved their stamp(so we stamp the hitchhikers book),<br/>
2. the HH owner would like to know where it had been, so stamp the hh <br/>
book from the the box you found it at if it hasnt been done already <br/>
(ive discovered when traveling with whiny people we just want to dump <br/>
it and run without stamping the new box, the whine by that point has <br/>
reached an unpleasant pitch),<br/>
3. the owner of the permanent box would probably be elated to know <br/>
their site had been graced by a hitchhiker (so tune out that whine <br/>
just long enough to check the log book where you found it to make <br/>
sure an impression had been made in the permanent sites log, before <br/>
running off to the next box or Wendy's). <br/>
<br/>
i thought those 3 things were common, and i have found that wetnaps, <br/>
or generic baby wet wipes make a great addition to a stamping kit. i <br/>
had a stamper previous to me mess up my ink pad of the day because <br/>
they left a mess on the stamp. And i have seen the evidence of wiping <br/>
too hard, pretty stamps made of eraser with bits ripped off. Wipe <br/>
with care!<br/>
what are your thoughts?<br/>

See a discussion from like 8/9 I think about not using wet wipes to <br/>
clean stamps because over time, the chemicals in the wet wipes will <br/>
break down rubber AND because animals may smell the chemicals and dig <br/>
up the boxes.<br/>
