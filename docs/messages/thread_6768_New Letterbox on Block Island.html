"Treasure Chest" on Sandy Point, Block Island,RI<br/>
<br/>
     Sandy Point is the northernmost terminus of Block Island. The <br/>
hike to get there from Cow Cove/Settler's Rock parking lot is arduous <br/>
(3/4 mile through soft sand), but the view is worth it. If you stand <br/>
on the very tip of Sandy Point and look south, you can visualize the <br/>
hard work of the glacier that moved through the area 12,000 years ago <br/>
bulldozing millions of tons of sand, clay, rock, and other detritus <br/>
into the basic configuration we see today.<br/>
     But let's get you out there first. Starting at the Old Harbor <br/>
ferry landing, take a right on Water street toward the Surf Hotel. <br/>
Water St. ends there and becomes Dodge. Follow Dodge a short distance <br/>
to the first major intersection, and take the right turn onto Corn <br/>
Neck Rd. Follow Corn Neck 3+1/2 miles to where it ends in the parking <br/>
area at Settler's Rock. Dismount whatever transportation has gotten <br/>
you that far and start the trek out to Sandy Point. Go past the main <br/>
sandy swarth that leads to North Light (visit it on the way back; a <br/>
$2.00 charge if its open and there is a letterbox up there also). <br/>
Continuing down the beach, find a small granite pylon in an open area <br/>
about 75 yards before the dunes flatten out. To the right of the <br/>
pylon,is a much larger block of cement which probably served as <br/>
a "secure" base for a long ago beacon. Look on the north side of the <br/>
block under a board and 2 beach stones for the Sandy Point "Treasure <br/>
Chest". Stamp in and take a piece of treasure for good luck. Health <br/>
and prosperity to all who follow.                    The Grifs<br/>
