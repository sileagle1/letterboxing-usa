<div>Planted By: Cock-A-Doodle-Moo 4-H  during 
the Wapping Fair  at Rye Street Park Sept. 8,9, 2001  This box was one 
of the Tolland County Fair boxes which now makes a permanent home at the site of 
yet another fair. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Street directions:  Go to Wapping near 
South Windsor Ct.  From Sullivan Ave. ( Rte 194)  Take Troy St. ( 
Battisons Cleaners on the corner) follow Troy St. to the end. This  T  
intersection take a right on  Rye Street. The park is just a little  
bit up the street on the right.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Box directions:  Drive into this lovely 
park  where the option to turn left comes stay straight and count 6 single 
Maple trees on the left. Note the spot and park the car. From the sixth 
Maple  cross the driveway  enter the woods, a few feet in a tree was 
cut and under a chnk of its wood you will find a cute clucker.  The box has 
many stamps from  Tolland County Fair a great collection, now there are 
more pages to fill at this the Cute Cluckers permanent home. </div>
<div>    Beyond the tennis courts and 
to the left is where the fair is held. A small country fair with  a few 
rides , great french fries. 23 cows and quite a few  goats we brought 3 
sheep and they were the show. One team of oxen walked to the fair from their 
home 1 1/2 miles away. The fire and police dept. had nice displays and 4-H kids 
brought home ribbons for the work of cleaning the animals and showing them. 
A  great weekend topped off by leaving the box .  Hope you all 
enjoy!  Be safe and have Fun!  Leader of the Pack &amp; Cowboy
