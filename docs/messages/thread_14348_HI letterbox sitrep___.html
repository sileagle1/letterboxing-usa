Koko Crater--alive &amp; well with numerous visitors<br/>
Celestial Beings--alive &amp; well with a handful of visitors<br/>
Silent Sentinel--alive &amp; well with numerous visitors<br/>

Great treks, gorgeous views &amp; interesting flora &amp; fauna.  Can't wait <br/>
to attempt the other boxes around here!<br/>

Found the other two letterboxes (that we know about, at least) on <br/>
O'ahu today--<br/>
<br/>
Lanikai Bunkers--alive &amp; well with multiple visitors<br/>
<br/>
I'iwi--alive &amp; well, we were the second group of visitors--the <br/>
previous (&amp; 1st) group visited back in May 2002--it was doing well, <br/>
just lonely--it was also a great day for a swim!<br/>
<br/>
Had the wonderful pleasure of meeting up/exchanging with Stamphi <br/>
today, too!  Letterboxers are just really COOL people!!!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail...<br/>
