<br/>
 We stopped at the Burr Oak area and found your limestone box on our way up <br/>
to Mount Rushmore.  Thanks for a great hike...there are an abundance of <br/>
letterboxes and geocaches in this area and we wished we could have found them <br/>
all but it was getting dark and we had far to go.  The Limestone box was the <br/>
only one we had time for with the kids.   :o)<br/>
<br/>
The ziplock had been chewed a bit by critters and the log book and tidy <br/>
little labels were soaked.  We stamped in the best we could and added a <br/>
smaller ziplock to put the log and labels in. Hoping to keep them from <br/>
getting much wetter.  You may want to dry it all out before it begins to mold.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>
Mohmers and gang!!!!!<br/>
