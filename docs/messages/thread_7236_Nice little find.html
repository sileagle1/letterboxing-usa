thought you'll might use.  I've been doing some rubber stamping as of <br/>
late, for this and that, and was in a kay-be toystore and found a large <br/>
box marked, 'Wood Stamps' in the girls' beading aisles.  This was 9.99 <br/>
(marked down) and had 9 very nice stamps, stamp pad, markers, etc, etc, <br/>
in it.  A real bargin, I hope some of you can use.  :o)<br/>

It is that which is stronger than the strongest armour.  It is that which is sharper than the sharpest blade.  It is faith, forged from mercy and honor.  Do that which is honorable and just, in the most compassionate way that you can, and it shall never fail you.<br/>
