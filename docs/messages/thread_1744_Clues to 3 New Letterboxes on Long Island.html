Orient Point Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Here's one reached by land or sea,<br/>
On a Point named Orient, planted by me.<br/>
<br/>
A walk along the rocky beach,<br/>
Is what you'll do this box to reach.<br/>
<br/>
Climb the hill, take in the sight,<br/>
Find the "I", and face the light.<br/>
<br/>
A few steps toward the great grey rock,<br/>
Lifting the stone, this treasure to unlock.<br/>
<br/>

Turtle Crossing Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
The entrance to Orient Beach State Park is a very short distance from <br/>
the Orient Point Ferry terminal.  An easy walk or drive to the <br/>
entrance and down the causeway to the parking lot that leads to a <br/>
four-mile narrow spit of beach with beautiful views of Gardiner's Bay <br/>
and Shelter Island Sound.<br/>
<br/>
Northwest of the picnic area you'll find a Start Post on a paved path <br/>
which leads to a gravel path to the right leading to the Roy Latham <br/>
Maritime Forest Trail.  This is an easy 1/2 mile loop, which will <br/>
leave you plenty of time to explore the rest of the Park.  <br/>
<br/>
At the 11th leaf, just 8 paces to the left, you'll reach a fallen <br/>
trunk.  At the base of the tree standing above it, you'll find the <br/>
Turtle covered with leaves.  Please recover well to keep hidden from <br/>
view.  Take note of the poison ivy and tick warnings which are posted <br/>
at the trailhead.<br/>
<br/>

Jayne's Hill Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
An excursion further west onto Long Island will take you to Jayne's <br/>
Hill, the highest point on the Island at 400 feet above sea level.  <br/>
Jayne's Hill is a landmark along the Walt Whitman Trail.  Follow the <br/>
Long Island Expressway (Route 495) west to Exit 49N "Route 110 North <br/>
&amp; Huntington."  Continue north on Rt. 110, following the brown <br/>
Historic Walt Whitman Estate signs.  From 110 North, as you near the <br/>
Walt Whitman Mall on the right, make a left onto Dorchester Lane, and <br/>
a left on Burgess Road to Resevoir Road.  Follow Resevoir Road to the <br/>
end where you'll find the trailhead for the Walt Whitman Trail.  <br/>
Follow the White/red blazes to Jayne's Hill.  The commemorative <br/>
placque is missing from Jayne's famous stone, but more information <br/>
can be found at www.liglobal.com/walt/whitland/whit2.shtml#jayne.<br/>
<br/>
Look past the bench into the woods to a crooked old tree towering <br/>
over a fallen trunk.  Where the fallen tree meets the gnarly tree <br/>
trunk, you'll find the Jayne's Hill Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the Island!<br/>

Your new Long Island clues are posted now. I find something strangely <br/>
appealing in their names ;-)<br/>
