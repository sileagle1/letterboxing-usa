<br/>
I will be attending the annual American Planning Association conference in <br/>
Washington, DC, from Saturday (4/24) through Wednesday (4/28) and, if my <br/>
schedule permits, I hope to do some letterboxing in the nearby area. Is there anyone <br/>
else from this group who will also be at the conference who might like to try <br/>
to hook up and go letterboxing together? If so, please contact me directly <br/>
(i.e., off-list) and we'll see what arrangements we might be able to make.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
<br/>
Alan from Axtown<br/>
(Still alive and letterboxing, though hasn't posted anything to this list in <br/>
a looooong time!)<br/>
