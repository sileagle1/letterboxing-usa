my favorite things about HH's is opening the log book and carefully peeling<br/>
back the layers, discovering the different destinations and the bearers of<br/>
these little boxes of surprise at each point of the journey.  I enjoy the<br/>
occasional posting of one of our family's travellers stops and private emails<br/>
from different letterboxers who have enjoyed them.<br/>
<br/>
It was recently brought to my attention that the entire history of HH's are<br/>
being kept on some sites on the web.  I can appreciate that some would like to<br/>
know exactly where there HH's have been so that they can box vicariously<br/>
through them.  I prefer to have just little glimpses now and then.  My thanks<br/>
to those that have taken the effort to publicly track all the stops of our<br/>
travellers but I would appreciate if our family's HH's could be left in mystery<br/>
and not included.<br/>
