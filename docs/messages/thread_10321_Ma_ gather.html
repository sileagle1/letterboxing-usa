hadn't seen anything on it but its always fun to see what boxes folks <br/>
are working on.   If interested I'll bring something for a couple <br/>
prizes. I think our organizers can act as judges or delegate . What <br/>
do you think?<br/>
   Also coming in from Mansfield,Ct. anybody want to ride along? I <br/>
want a reasonably early start I'm making a 4:15 a.m. airport run an <br/>
should be back here by 6:30 a quick bunch of chores and I'll be ready <br/>
to go.   My family has been sick so I'm going solo it looks like. <br/>

We hadn't specifically planned on it, but that doesn't mean it can't <br/>
happen.  Please do bring prizes and we'll see what we can whip up!<br/>

Sorry to hear the family is down for the count.  I know Rustypuff was <br/>
looking forward to being on the receiving end of one of Cowboy's <br/>
extensive herds of cattle!<br/>
