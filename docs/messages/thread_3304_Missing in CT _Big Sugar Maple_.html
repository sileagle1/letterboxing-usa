&gt; Today was a day of drive-by boxes for us.  We stamped in on the last<br/>
&gt; page of the Big Sugar Maple Letterbox log book.  I would have <br/>
replace<br/>
&gt; the log but we brought only the bare minimum supplies as we knew we<br/>
&gt; would be driving through the area.  It is a popular "first <br/>
letterbox"<br/>
&gt; for many.  We also "Zoomed" to Essex for another quick stop.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We hope this weather keeps up far into the fall!<br/>

We also stamped in the Big Sugar Maple Letterbox on Sunday, some time <br/>
after you.  I wrote a note on the cover of the log book (although a <br/>
bit hard to see) telling stampers to flip the book over and use the <br/>
back side to stamp in on.  Hope this was okay to do, but didn't want <br/>
anyone finding it to be disappointed that there was no room for them <br/>
to stamp in.<br/>
