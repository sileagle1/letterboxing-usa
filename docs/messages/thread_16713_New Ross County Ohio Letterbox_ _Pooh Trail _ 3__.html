Placed 11-03-03 by Salamander.Difficulty: Easy.  To find this <br/>
letterbox, you must go to the " Butterfly Garden" which was planted <br/>
by the Ross County Master Gardeners. (This is just off Camp Sherman <br/>
Rd. and is very near the High Street Dairy Mart store).           <br/>
CLUES: Stand in front of the sign which depicts 2 black butterflies <br/>
and take a compass reading of 100 degrees. Go 38 paces at that <br/>
heading to a blue and gray man-made object. Standing approximately 4 <br/>
feet to the west of this object, take a reading of 80 degrees. Four <br/>
paces at this heading will take you to a double-trunked tree. The <br/>
box is hidden in a nest of rocks and bark at the base of the tree.<br/>
