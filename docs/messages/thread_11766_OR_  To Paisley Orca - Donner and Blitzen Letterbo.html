<br/>
We were at the Malheur Waterfowl Festival in Burns, Oregon, on <br/>
Saturday, 4/5/03.  We ended up in Page Springs and I found your <br/>
Donner and Blizten Letterbox.  I just found out about letterboxing <br/>
about a week ago and your box was my first find!!!  Thanks so much <br/>
for planting it!  Excellent clues, by the way.  It was really fun to <br/>
find it.  It's in good shape, in the cave in the little plastic box.  <br/>
I wish I'd had more time to read the other messages, but the rest of <br/>
the birdwatching group was waiting for me back at the van in the <br/>
campground.  Anyway, the letterbox is in good shape and there's <br/>
approximately 8 stamps in your little notepad.  Nice stamp too!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the adventure,<br/>
