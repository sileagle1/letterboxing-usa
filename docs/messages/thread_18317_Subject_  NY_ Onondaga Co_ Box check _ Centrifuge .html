                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went out and checked on our boxes in Green Lakes SP this <br/>
week and am happy to say that they all survived the winter. <br/>
Even the one that I thought was lost last fall. Turns out <br/>
it was tucked away in a spot not quite where it should have <br/>
been, and was well hidden by last fall's thick layer of <br/>
leaves.<br/>
<br/>
I was expecting to find the Crystal Dye inkpad I left in <br/>
one box to be useless after the long cold winter, but <br/>
other than the pad starting to separate from the box, it <br/>
still had ink and made a good impression.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be getting out to check our other boxes soon and will <br/>
have some new additions to announce before long.<br/>
<br/>
The little 50mm centrifuge tube micro-boxes came thru with <br/>
flying colors. I placed my order for a case and expect to <br/>
see them in about 10 days. If anyone wants to see what they <br/>
look like I have some pictures with more information here: <br/>
http://www.catbeadmischief.com/microbox.html<br/>
Some quick information: I ordered the ones with a place to <br/>
write on, so the cost will be higher at <gasp> 2 for 29 <br/>
plus shipping from me to you. Since this is my cost, there <br/>
will not be any sales tax for NY.  If anyone wants to give <br/>
them a try, contact me off list or follow the email link on <br/>
the above page on my website. <br/>

My one warning is if the caps get screwed down TOO tight they will<br/>
crack (the round top will separate<br/>
from the serrated sides).  Your price is very reasonable, too.<br/>
