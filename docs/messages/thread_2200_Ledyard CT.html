I believe that the boxes I visited are EMS boxes and wanted to give y'all a <br/>
heads up on their state.  The box at Whitehall is in need of a book/new cards <br/>
or paper.  Good thing I had my clues to stamp on! I replaced the bag there so <br/>
at least it will stay drier.  As for the box by Poquetanuck Cove the only <br/>
thing in it is a stamp and two scraps of paper (three now that mine is in <br/>
there...)  I am out of extra supplies so I didn't refill anything.<br/>
Off to fill my cold frames!<br/>
