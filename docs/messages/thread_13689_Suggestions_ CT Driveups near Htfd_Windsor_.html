                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're headed up to a fire fighters convention at the Big E in <br/>
Massachusetts on Saturday. Its supposed to be awfully rainy <br/>
(AGAIN!!!) on that day. We're hoping to do some drive-bys in the <br/>
greater Hartford area on the way up or the way back. Likely route of <br/>
travel will be Rte 85 to Rte 11 to Rte 2 in Colchester and then Rte 2 <br/>
to I-91 north all the way up into Mass.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions for some drive ups ??  We're thinking about the <br/>
Marlborough Cong. Church box, Stamp Studio in Manchester, and Ferry <br/>
Flit in Glastonbury.  I used to work in Hartford and lived in Vernon <br/>
for my first 17 years so I know the area well, just don't <br/>
particularly follow letterboxing up that way... <br/>
<br/>

We might even have to raid Music Woman's house : ) <br/>

Cute Cluckers and Cream of the Crop, in South Windsor<br/>
are very quick and easy boxes. Jeffrey O. Phelps in<br/>
Simsbury, Winter Gathering in Suffield, Farmington<br/>
Valley Greenway South in Avon, and Jonathan's Dream in<br/>
West Hartford are all drive-by boxes. Perseid in<br/>
Westfield, MA (down the road from the Big E) is also<br/>
nearly a drive-by (ten minutes or so). <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
