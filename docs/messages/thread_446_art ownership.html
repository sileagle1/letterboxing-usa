                    <div class="plaintext-content">It has come to my attention that there are some mis-conceptions<br/>
about art/clue ownership.  Here is my take at clarifying the<br/>
issue so that we are all on the same sheet of music:<br/>
<br/>
The artists who create clues and art own their work, unless they<br/>
explicitly disclaim that ownership.  No one who maintains the web<br/>
sites, e-mail lists, or network owns it, nor is there shared <br/>
ownership of that work by the subscribers to the e-mail list,<br/>
the hunters of the letterboxes, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I bring this up for two reasons.  a) because concern has been <br/>
expressed to me about the fact that I wish to retain the <br/>
exclusive rights to my art.  I indeed do wish to do this, simply<br/>
because I do not want anyone publishing or altering it without my<br/>
consent, nor do I wish anyone to make profit on that which I give <br/>
access to freely.  (Imagine if someone took a clue who did not know<br/>
what they were doing, and edited it to fix the grammar, and in so <br/>
doing made the clue unsolvable, because the grammar error was <br/>
important to solving the clue -- don't say it cannot happen :-)).<br/>
I believe this is a reasonable position, and was under the <br/>
impression that this was a position shared by most everyone who<br/>
is creating letterbox art.<br/>
<br/>
And b) perhaps more importantly, because I was asked permission <br/>
(in a legitimate way) to reproduce some of the work on the web <br/>
site.  I believe I did the correct thing by saying that permission<br/>
had to be obtained from each artist.  I would think it was wrong<br/>
if someone else granted permission to reproduce my clues in a <br/>
guidebook, for example, without discussing it with me.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we can do what we want, I suppose.  We can put something<br/>
on the web site that says, "unless otherwise specified, the art here<br/>
is public domain", or "unless otherwise specified, the art here is<br/>
the property of its author", etc.  Whatever people want to do, it<br/>
should be clear, and it should be easy for people who do not wish to<br/>
accept the default option to opt out of it.<br/>
<br/>
If people generally agree with this thesis, then no action is <br/>
necessary, I suppose, except perhaps a notation of this fact on<br/>
the web site, which I will add in a few days if there are no <br/>
objections.  If people feel I am off base, which is always possible :-),<br/>
then perhaps we should clarify the issue before someone comes along <br/>
and wants to produce and sell guidebooks or the like.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the interruption; I know the stuff I tend to bring up can be<br/>
tedious at times, but sometimes it is important.  We now return you <br/>
to your regularly scheduled letterboxing :-)<br/>

Dan, <br/>

I think you missed the point.  It is _not free_ for a third party<br/>
to come along and publish art without permission of the individual<br/>
artists, nor is it free for _me_ to give permission to a third party<br/>
to publish _Tom's_ clues.  That is all I was saying.<br/>
<br/>
Think "free redistribution", not "free beer".<br/>

&gt; &gt;  what they were doing, and edited it to fix the grammar, and in so<br/>
&gt; &gt;  doing made the clue unsolvable, because the grammar error was<br/>
&gt; &gt;  important to solving the clue -- don't say it cannot happen :-)).<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I believe this is a reasonable position, and was under the<br/>
&gt; &gt;  impression that this was a position shared by most everyone who<br/>
&gt; &gt;  is creating letterbox art.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  And b) perhaps more importantly, because I was asked permission<br/>
&gt; &gt;  (in a legitimate way) to reproduce some of the work on the web<br/>
&gt; &gt;  site.  I believe I did the correct thing by saying that permission<br/>
&gt; &gt;  had to be obtained from each artist.  I would think it was wrong<br/>
&gt; &gt;  if someone else granted permission to reproduce my clues in a<br/>
&gt; &gt;  guidebook, for example, without discussing it with me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Of course, we can do what we want, I suppose.  We can put something<br/>
&gt; &gt;  on the web site that says, "unless otherwise specified, the art here<br/>
&gt; &gt;  is public domain", or "unless otherwise specified, the art here is<br/>
&gt; &gt;  the property of its author", etc.  Whatever people want to do, it<br/>
&gt; &gt;  should be clear, and it should be easy for people who do not wish to<br/>
&gt; &gt;  accept the default option to opt out of it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  If people generally agree with this thesis, then no action is<br/>
&gt; &gt;  necessary, I suppose, except perhaps a notation of this fact on<br/>
&gt; &gt;  the web site, which I will add in a few days if there are no<br/>
&gt; &gt;  objections.  If people feel I am off base, which is always possible <br/>
&gt;:-),<br/>
&gt; &gt;  then perhaps we should clarify the issue before someone comes along<br/>
&gt; &gt;  and wants to produce and sell guidebooks or the like.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Sorry for the interruption; I know the stuff I tend to bring up can be<br/>
&gt; &gt;  tedious at times, but sometimes it is important.  We now return you<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I have recently been put into a position where I have had<br/>
to scrutinize the US Copyright Law.  The text of the Law is very<br/>
clear....  the artist retains all rights (especially duplication &amp;<br/>
distribution) to his/her work unless expressly stated in a signed<br/>
contract.  In the absence of a contract the artist STILL owns the<br/>
rights... even if the original art is sold.  Ownership and copyrights<br/>
are 2 distinct issues. There are exceptions, but they don't apply here. <br/>
Since about 1991 it has not been neccesary to include the handy little<br/>
circle-C copyright symbol.  It is still used simply to remind those who<br/>
who don't know any better.<br/>
<br/>
I support a copyright page on the website that makes it clear.. we<br/>
encourage use of the clues &amp; art for the purpose of finding<br/>
letterboxes.  Any use for redistribution or publishing is otherwise<br/>
expressly prohibited without the signed permission of the artist.  The<br/>
safety statement that the Graphic Artist Guild recommends is:  "All<br/>
other rights, unless specifically granted are retained by the<br/>
artist(s)."  That pretty much covers any contingencies.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;  It has come to my attention that there are some mis-conceptions<br/>
&gt;  about art/clue ownership.  Here is my take at clarifying the<br/>
&gt;  issue so that we are all on the same sheet of music:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  The artists who create clues and art own their work, unless they<br/>
&gt;  explicitly disclaim that ownership.  No one who maintains the web<br/>
&gt;  sites, e-mail lists, or network owns it, nor is there shared<br/>
&gt;  ownership of that work by the subscribers to the e-mail list,<br/>
&gt;  the hunters of the letterboxes, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I bring this up for two reasons.  a) because concern has been<br/>
&gt;  expressed to me about the fact that I wish to retain the<br/>
&gt;  exclusive rights to my art.  I indeed do wish to do this, simply<br/>
&gt;  because I do not want anyone publishing or altering it without my<br/>
&gt;  consent, nor do I wish anyone to make profit on that which I give<br/>
&gt;  access to freely.  (Imagine if someone took a clue who did not know<br/>
&gt;  what they were doing, and edited it to fix the grammar, and in so<br/>
&gt;  doing made the clue unsolvable, because the grammar error was<br/>
&gt;  important to solving the clue -- don't say it cannot happen :-)).<br/>
&gt;  I believe this is a reasonable position, and was under the<br/>
&gt;  impression that this was a position shared by most everyone who<br/>
&gt;  is creating letterbox art.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  And b) perhaps more importantly, because I was asked permission<br/>
&gt;  (in a legitimate way) to reproduce some of the work on the web<br/>
&gt;  site.  I believe I did the correct thing by saying that permission<br/>
&gt;  had to be obtained from each artist.  I would think it was wrong<br/>
&gt;  if someone else granted permission to reproduce my clues in a<br/>
&gt;  guidebook, for example, without discussing it with me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Of course, we can do what we want, I suppose.  We can put something<br/>
&gt;  on the web site that says, "unless otherwise specified, the art here<br/>
&gt;  is public domain", or "unless otherwise specified, the art here is<br/>
&gt;  the property of its author", etc.  Whatever people want to do, it<br/>
&gt;  should be clear, and it should be easy for people who do not wish to<br/>
&gt;  accept the default option to opt out of it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  If people generally agree with this thesis, then no action is<br/>
&gt;  necessary, I suppose, except perhaps a notation of this fact on<br/>
&gt;  the web site, which I will add in a few days if there are no<br/>
&gt;  objections.  If people feel I am off base, which is always possible :-),<br/>

&gt;  Randy "the mapsurfer"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I agree EMPHATICALLY with Randy, on all points here.<br/>
While I would likely be inclined to allow my stamps &amp; clues to be<br/>
reproduced, say, in a guidebook, I do feel that each is a valid art form<br/>
to which I retain rights as an artist. Thus, permission oto use is<br/>
required. I certainly would never allow them to be incorporated, say,<br/>
within another work of art, at least , not without a clear understading,<br/>
and with express permission.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps those whho feel in like manner could have their stamp/clue sets<br/>
followed by a "copyrite 1999" line on the page?  However, I feel that a<br/>
blanket statement covering all would be better, saying, perhaps, "Unless<br/>

BTW, the web page itself should be copyrighted, perhaps by Dan, or?<br/>

&gt;  Randy, you are right on target.  The stamp art that people create and the<br/>
&gt;  clues they write are their property and should not be reproduced and<br/>
&gt;  especially not altered without their consent.  I think we do need a note on<br/>
&gt;  the web site that makes this clear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Bonnie<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I don't have any problem with a not-for-profit entity<br/>
downloading and passing out clues. Say a library wants to do a display<br/>
on the hobby? Who would object to that. But, if someone wants to<br/>
publish, for profit,  a guide, I feel I reserve the right to decide if I<br/>
want to be included. We should all.<br/>

To the contrary (you not considering yourself an artist!).  <br/>
The bane of young artists is proper regognition. Its a special<br/>
vulnerability - you want, crave recognitionn, and may fall into the trap<br/>
of giving it away or selling at low cost to avoid rejection.  This hobby<br/>
has produced some really fine "art" images. The reason I keep asking to<br/>
see them on the web page is for the mutual feedback among us. None of us<br/>
have anything to be overly modest about. It's your work, it is "art",<br/>
and, dang it, you are an "artist" in that sense. Stand tall and proud,<br/>
as it helps the rest of us as well!<br/>
