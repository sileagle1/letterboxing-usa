  Guide to a series of letterboxes along the East Bay Bicycle Path <br/>
                                                   Series II<br/>
<br/>
	The directions for this series of boxes begin at the first <br/>
parking lot for the bike path a mile or so along Veterans Parkway <br/>
(Rhode Island exit 4 from  I-195). The first box in this series is <br/>
located here and the last in Haines Memorial State Park in <br/>
Barrington. The second parking lot along the parkway is about three <br/>
quarters of a mile south of the first and, although much smaller, may <br/>
a good place to park to walk the middle three boxes. There is also a <br/>
bike path parking lot further down after the parkway gives way to <br/>
Bullocks Point Avenue from which one could walk northward the same <br/>
distance to reach those boxes. <br/>
	For more info on the East Bay Bike Path, as well as other <br/>
bike paths and cycling in Rhode Island in general check out the RIDOT <br/>
website at www.dot.state.ri.us/webTran/bikeri.html  . They even have <br/>
a cycling map on there which you can use to zoom in on areas of <br/>
interest such as the bike paths.<br/>
For other info on cycling in Rhode Island and elsewhere try the <br/>
website for the Narragansett Bay Wheelmen at www.nbwclub.org  <br/>
<br/>
The Sightseer<br/>
	The Sightseer is hidden behind the second yew from the south <br/>
end of the retaining wall between parking lot 1 and the path. You can <br/>
stand against the wall on the bike path side and scootch around for <br/>
it in the mulch between the shrub and the wall. This spot is a <br/>
definite photo-op with its great view of Providence, in fact while we <br/>
were here someone was taking a group photo as they were about to set <br/>
out on their bikes. As native west bay Rhode Islanders this place <br/>
knocks us out every time we come by. The bike path continues <br/>
northward for about another mile to the soon to be more bike and <br/>
pedestrian friendly Washington Bridge and thence into the city which <br/>
is very cool, but to get to the next box turn your attention <br/>
southward.<br/>
<br/>
 The Fisherman<br/>
	The second parking lot is .7 of a mile south of the first one <br/>
along the bike path. Another half mile (1.2 mi. s of lot 1) is a <br/>
small bridge over an inlet opening to Watchemoket Cove. There were <br/>
several people fishing here when we passed by on our return from the <br/>
planting expedition. Look under a couple of flat rocks at the base of <br/>
the fourth fencepost north of the bridge for the Fisherman. You can <br/>
reach under the fence to do this without climbing over it.  <br/>
<br/>
The Stroller<br/>
   	Continue south for about another half mile (1.9 mi s of lot <br/>
1) and cross another bridge just past the Squantum Club. Next to a <br/>
rocky cove, find the diamond shaped marker indicating 3 miles south <br/>
on the path. Stand on it, look out to the bay, turn slightly to your <br/>
left, and sight across the tracks to the first tree (very near the <br/>
tree are two metal rings in the rock) on the little rocky point to <br/>
your left. Directly beneath where this line of sight passes over the <br/>
tracks lies a sleeper with the Stroller hidden (hopefully) in the <br/>
ballast under its seaward end. Its the ninth sleeper to your right of <br/>
a series of ties with their ends completely buried. Many of the <br/>
strollers we pass by on the path have sleepers in them. <br/>
<br/>
The Letterboxer<br/>
	 About three-quarters of a mile south of the Stroller (2.7 mi <br/>
s of lot 1 and 2 mi s of lot 2 if you parked there) you will come <br/>
abreast of Fuller Rock Lighthouse. Tear your attention away from the <br/>
view and you will see a small cliff or rock face on the opposite side <br/>
of the path with a fence ending at it. Two or three paces south of <br/>
the end of the fence the letterboxer is hidden underneath (what <br/>
else?) a small pile of rocks. A half mile farther south (3.2 mi s of <br/>
lot 1) is the bike path parking lot at the corner of Bullocks Point <br/>
Avenue and Washington Ave. A few hundred yards before this parking <br/>
lot the path goes through a tunnel that has some nifty paintings of <br/>
local scenes. <br/>
<br/>
The Handcyclist <br/>
	At Haines Memorial State Park ( two miles south of the <br/>
Letterboxer and 4.7 mi s of lot 1) pull into the parking lot for the <br/>
picnic area, not the new boat ramp lot, but the one next to a <br/>
boatyard. The lot entrance is from Metropolitan Park Drive which can <br/>
be reached from RI 103. Some fellow cyclists we met who were riding <br/>
handcycles told us they often meet friends at this lot to start a <br/>
ride, so it seemed an appropriate spot for this stamp. They also told <br/>
us that there some of these expensive machines available for people <br/>
to use are stored at a couple of locations along the path. For info <br/>
check the website www.challengecycling.org  <br/>
To find the box circle the lot and find a short hedge on the marina <br/>
side of the lot near the entrance. Go around the west end of the <br/>
hedge and take three short paces toward the marina fence and you <br/>
should be standing next to some junipers. Look under them. Sit on the <br/>
rock if its there and reach the box. <br/>
