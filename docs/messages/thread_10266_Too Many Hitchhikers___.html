&gt;Are there too many hitchhikers out there...I have been having<br/>
&gt;discussions with other letterboxers (off of the board) and that has<br/>
&gt;been a major topic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It seems like every box we find has a hitchhiker in it.<br/>
<br/>
I think what you're seeing is a case of geographic displacement. I did some <br/>
writing on hitchhikers on my site recently <br/>
(http://www.letterboxing.info/articles/00000010.shtml) and I figured that <br/>
as of November 2002, there were approximately 280 hitchhikers in <br/>
circulation in the United States. With more than 2,500 letterboxes in the <br/>
U.S., you ought to find a hitchhiker in every ten letterboxes you find (on <br/>
average). I expect that the average is actually lower since a number of <br/>
those hitchhikers are often in someone's backpack or sitting on their desk <br/>
for stretches of time between letterboxing excursions, and another number <br/>
are almost certainly lost since there's no way of knowing for sure if <br/>
they're still in existent. (Of course, there may also be more hitchhikers <br/>
that have never been announced publicly, as well.)<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I've found 4 hitchhikers and 81 letterboxes, or half of what <br/>
you'd expect from the raw numbers. When I was in Nebraska, I found 8 boxes <br/>
(just about all of the boxes in existence in the greater Omaha/Lincoln area <br/>
at the time) and no hitchhikers; I've found 17 boxes in PA and no <br/>
hitchhikers; 12 boxes in Michigan and no hitchhikers; but 20 boxes in New <br/>
Jersey and 2 hitchhikers.<br/>
<br/>
Judging from the talk on the LBNA list, lots of people have never found <br/>
hitchhikers, and they get very excited when they finally do. From that, and <br/>
from the numbers themselves, I'd<br/>
<br/>
But if your neck of the woods is oversaturated with hitchhikers, then I'd <br/>
agree that it's the right thing to do for 'boxers in that area to hold off <br/>
on planting new hitchhikers, and to make an effort to move the hitchhikers <br/>
outwards, away from the epicenter of 'contamination' <g>. There are a lot <br/>
of 'boxers out there who would be thrilled to find just one!<br/>
