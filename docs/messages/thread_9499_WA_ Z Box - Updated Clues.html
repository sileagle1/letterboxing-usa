<p>Nearest Town: Olympia, WA <br/>County: Thurston <br/>Placed: 11-30-02 </p>
<p>Placed By: Fudrick <br/>Clues: Trivial <br/>Trek: Easy, a driveby </p>
<p>The new Thurston County Courthouse was built on one of the prime view 
locations overlooking Budd Bay, the Capital Building, and Olympia. Why the 
location was not used for high-priced condos is unknown. </p>
<p>Steve "Z" Zimmerman was the Deputy Administrative Officer for Thurston 
County. He was liked and respected by his co-workers. A fast acting cancer was 
discovered, he did not last long. He is missed. This box was placed in his 
memory.</p><b>
</b><p>To The Trailhead: From I-5 take Exit 104 to US-101. Take the first exit 
off US 101 (Crosby and Cooper Point Roads). Turn right at the light at the end 
of the ramp. Turn right at the next light (at the AM-PM). Turn right at the 
first opportunity (going on the third side of the AM-PM). Take the third right, 
Lakeridge Drive, Enter the Courthouse Parking Lot, take the first right and go 
straight down to the viewpoint. Parking should be available.</p>
<p>WARNING: If you are heading Northbound on I-5, you will need to merge across 
two lanes of traffic to get to the first exit. If traffic is heavy, take the 
easy way and go to the second exit, Black Lake Boulevard. Turn right at the 
light onto Black Lake Boulevard, turn right at the first light onto Cooper Point 
Road, turn left at the second light (at the AM-PM), and you are back on 
track.</p>
<p>WARNING: The Thurston County Courthouse is a busy place during "normal 
working hours", and the Sheriff’s Office and Jail are 24 hour operations. The 
box is located where hard working County employees might see you, if they took 
the time to look out their window. Be diligent :-)</p><b>
</b><p>To The Letterbox; . Park in the lot and go out to the view point. Enjoy 
the vista. When you leave, walk westerly along the parking lot curb to the Steve 
"Z" Zimmerman memorial. If you were observant, you noted a stand of trees 
blocking your view of Budd Bay. Hidden in there was a stump with a ‘hip pocket’ 
where Z can enjoy the view. </p><i>
