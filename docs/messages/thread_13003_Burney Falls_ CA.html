<br/>
Yesterday, we had the fun of finding Funhog's Burney Falls Letterbox.<br/>
Though we had been to the park before, we had never hiked back to Lake <br/>
Britton.  ...Had no idea what we  had missed.  It was an easy and very <br/>
beautiful walk!  I encourage anyone going near this area to stop and <br/>
enjoy!<br/>
