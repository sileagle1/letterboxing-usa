                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hurray ! ! !   The troll has been vanquished.  Rock Creek is safe at last !!!<br/>
<br/>
You know, I'm almost certain that my car was one of the many buzzing overhead<br/>
during the search.  I'm glad to hear Thom's search party enjoyed their quest.<br/>
I hope they had at least half as much fun hunting as I had making these two<br/>
most recent letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
As Thom has mentioned, I camoflauged these two.  This was something new for me<br/>
that I stumbled onto, so maybe some of you would appreciate hearing the<br/>
details. <br/>
<br/>
The Rock Creek Dragon has a military-style camo that I did free-hand with<br/>
spray paint.  I was pondering the notion that the shiny beige lid of the<br/>
container I intended to hide was going to stand out like a road flare in the<br/>
wooded area where I wanted to hide it.  Then I noticed that I had some near<br/>
empty paint cans left over from previous projects in dark green, black, and<br/>
brown.  I masked off the clear bottom of the Rubbermaid container, so one<br/>
could still see inside and determine that the contents looked more like a<br/>
letterbox than a bomb.  Then I applied blotches of the three colors to the lid<br/>
and the sides of the container.<br/>
<br/>
The Rock Creek TROLL is the largest letterbox I've ever set out.  It had the<br/>
same color of lid as the Dragon, and was REALLY going to stand out in the dark<br/>
area I had chosen to hide it in.  This time, the surroundings were rocky, so I<br/>
dug around and found another remnant from a previous project... a can of that<br/>
Fleck-Stone textured spray that makes things look like they are made of<br/>
granite (sort of).  I think it worked well for the dark recess that is now its<br/>
home, although it sounds like it may have a bit of a dandruff problem.<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record, I fully expect The Troll to become the next Letterbox to<br/>
join Deborah's in Letterbox Heaven.  I'm trying to look on it as an<br/>
experiment, of sorts.  Perhaps this mind-set will ease my sorrow when it<br/>
disappears.  It is sitting uncovered in a very exposed (though dark and shady)<br/>
area, relying entirely on its camoflouge to make it invisible.  If found, the<br/>
contents (complete with stamp and matching bare-bottomed mascot) are very<br/>
tempting, as the younger members of Thom's party will reportedly testify.  <br/>
<br/>
Whatever the future brings for this letterbox will be a lesson in human<br/>
nature.  I'm hoping it will be a lesson in how un-observant we tend to be,<br/>
rather than how greedy and self-centered we can be.  Time will tell... my<br/>
advice is that you all hop on board the next flight to Portland, Oregon and<br/>
collect this stamp before it's gone!!!  The prints will likely be collector's<br/>
items!    :o)<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Der Mad Stamper<br/>
