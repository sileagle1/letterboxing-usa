                    <html><body>A BSA badge would have to involve a lot more than planting one box.  they really know a subject when they get done with merit badge requirements.  However, it would be a fun addition to the Cub program and they younger boys would be just as capable as the older ones.  They may even have more fun.  And I just bet there would be no problem finding a counselor for the badge among all the boxers around the country.  And it incorporates so many scout tasks and skills in one activity.  I'm talking it up every chance I get with my son's troop<br/>

I don't think a specific publication method should be mentioned (i.e., <br/>
"our website").  For example, creating and publishing a box thru the Valley <br/>

I know nothing of the system for the Scouts, but if you read my clues <br/>

to use skills and knowledge of Botany, Native Culture, Compass use.<br/>

&gt; Consider and don't shoot the messenger:  <br/>
&gt; Maybe the idea of a  letterboxing badge could be one that<br/>
encompasses several of the scouting skills as well as carving, finds<br/>
and plants.  It has been decades since I've been anywhere near<br/>
scouting and all the requirements, so, what do I know. Considering<br/>
some of the events of this past fall, first aid could even be included<br/>
in the requirements for such a badge.<br/>
