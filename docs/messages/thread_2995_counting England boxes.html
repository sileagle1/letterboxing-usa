Hi "Leader of the Pack" !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;If the Moorland Wizard is out there " listening" <br/>
Oh yes I always have my ears on <g> especially for LbNA ! <br/>
<br/>
&gt;could he give us an idea of how many boxes are in England. I had heard<br/>
&gt;10,000 in <br/>
&gt;Dartmoor?  <br/>
<br/>
Well that is a tricky one actually !<br/>
<br/>
Tony Moore has issued over 30,000 boxes in his latest edition of the<br/>
Catalogue of Dartmoor Letterboxes.  This is reprinted and updated twice a<br/>
year with bi-monthly mailed updates..we don't have a web-based catalogue<br/>
you see..we are still in the pen and ink stage <grin><br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER !<br/>
<br/>
I receive in the mail (not email !) between twenty and forty new boxes<br/>
every week from my WOM boxing friends.<br/>
<br/>
WOM ?<br/>
<br/>
Oh that's "Word of Mouth" boxes...a private circulation system for<br/>
particularly seriously infected boxers !  <g> You know, those with an<br/>
acute attack of the incurable boxing bug !  <lol><br/>
<br/>
They are boxes that are NOT in Tony's catalogue....<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that's half as many again !<br/>
<br/>
BUT that's not all !<br/>
<br/>
There are boxes in other places in England too (but we keep even more<br/>
quiet about those !!!)<br/>
<br/>
There is a delightful forest known as "The New Forest" which has its own<br/>
system (also not in Tony's catalogue)<br/>
<br/>
And then there are other British National Parks in which boxes can be<br/>
found....We don't put them in our cities like LbNA folk ! (Again NOT in<br/>
Tony's catalogue)<br/>
<br/>
Tony also has a separate catalogue for "Moving Boxes" which you in LbNA<br/>
land call Hitchikers ..and another catalogue for "Travelling Boxes"..which<br/>
are a second kind of personal stamp which we Dartmoorians also use !<br/>
<br/>
So remind me , "What was your question ?", How many in England !<br/>
<br/>
Ahh well that could be very high indeed....<br/>
<br/>
Certainly a lot more than 10,000 !<br/>
<br/>
Many many UK boxers have the 5,000 patch on their (boxing) jackets !<br/>
<br/>
It's all very very old and established over here..and we like to go for a<br/>
day's hike and collect 20 or 30, or more, whilst it seems that in the US<br/>
the numbers are much lower ...It is just that we are a much smaller place<br/>
and have been doing it longer.  Dartmoor is only about 370 square miles ! <br/>
But is is 'busy' with boxes...some days you just seem to fall over em !<br/>
<lol><br/>
<br/>
Finally we do remove and delete and time manage our boxes.  Some are "out"<br/>
for a day, or a month, or typically a few years..then we "pull them in". <br/>
As good citizens we don't litter the moor or allow any one box to build a<br/>
path to itself !!<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I don't really know ..you could think about the boxers count...<br/>
<br/>
I knew one boxer who claimed he had "managed" 1000 of his own .. but<br/>
allowing for "drift" <g> I guess many of my friends have about 150-200 or<br/>
so on the moor at any one time !<br/>
<br/>
Most keen boxers will "manage" 30-50 easily....look at the Drews as an<br/>
example, or Randy ..these folk manage a goodly numbers each !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I would guess that 20,000 or 25,000 could be on Dartmoor and as many<br/>
elsewhere all over Britain.<br/>
<br/>
That's 40,000 to 50,000 !<br/>
<br/>
That's not counting Travellers and Moving Boxes and other curiosities<br/>
which maybe are only about 5,000 more (maximum?) <br/>
<br/>
The final guess must be ....conservatively ............say 50,000 boxes at<br/>
any one time !<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Our 4-H Club the Cock-A-Doodle-Moo  is doing an <br/>
&gt;educational display with a world map  showing where the  boxes are <br/>
&gt;like Ct. 286. We got our other figures off the LBNA site for clues . <br/>
&gt;The title of the exhibit is " Where in the World Are You <br/>
&gt;Letterboxing". We may take it to the Big E the new England State <br/>
&gt;Fair. It is a great promotional tool.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That sound wonderful ...I wish you every success...Do post some pictures<br/>
to LbNA it will be appreciated !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also did anyone catch a post on Africa boxes I need to search further <br/>
&gt;but would be greeat if someone could help count out of states boxes! <br/>
<br/>
I know there are boxes in France and Denmark and Germany !<br/>
<br/>
I have lists for these countries !<br/>
<br/>
I know of at least one each in New Zealand, China , Australia  and<br/>
Japan...one is in the New Disney Seas Resort (Tokyo) which opens on Sept<br/>
4th...!  I planted the last three places myself !  For Tokyo you don't<br/>
have to take any E ride but maybe [Clue] " Seek out a beautiful coast and<br/>
ring the bell; Ask and it shall be given. "<br/>
<br/>
I have even planted boxes in Africa (One at the Southernmost point in<br/>
Africa is my most popular box in Africa. I get emails about once a month<br/>
from new finders !) and Now I have planted boxes in Russia !!!  Only three<br/>
there so far !  (You have to be very brave to hunt them ! <lol>)  All in<br/>
Moscow !<br/>
<br/>
That's about all I can locate !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing<br/>

<br/>
You said you know of at least one letterbox in New Zealand, eh?  Is it<br/>
on the North or the South Island?  How may I obtain clues for said<br/>
box(es).  A couple of other letterboxes here in Oregon are going to New<br/>
Zealand in October and John and I plan to  visit the South Island in<br/>
December.  If you can point us in the correct direction for clues I'd be<br/>
most appreciative!  <br/>

I think you're gonna need A LOT of pins for your map!!!<br/>
<br/>
Let us know if you do exhibit at the Big E (Eastern States <br/>
Exposition). I'll be sure to look for you!<br/>
