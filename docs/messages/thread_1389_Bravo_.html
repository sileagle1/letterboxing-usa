The Kid's Section is the work of Mitch Klink. As most of you know, <br/>
Mitch has been involved in LbNA since its inception and has just <br/>
rejoined us after a hiatus of several months. We are all very glad to <br/>
see the Kids Section back at our site.<br/>

&gt; Again Bravo and a  standing ovation for the wonderful job done on the <br/>
&gt; kids section!!!!! This will really help personalize the whole <br/>
&gt; activity to the kids level.  I know my son and 4-H kids are going to <br/>
&gt; love discovering all the new things in the site.   They realize they <br/>
&gt; are important when a whole section is theirs.  For all and anyone who <br/>
&gt; worked on that , Thank-you. Carol Stearns Cock-A-Doodle-Moo 4-H Club. <br/>
