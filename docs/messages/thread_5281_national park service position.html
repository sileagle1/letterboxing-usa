I was amazed at the reactionary response to letterboxing as well.  The<br/>
report makes it sound as if we are dealing drugs or poaching endangered<br/>
animals within the boundaries of these parks.  In one of the reports they<br/>
mention discussing the dangers (or whatever the wording was) of geocaching<br/>
with whomever had hidden one in that particular park.  I would like to have<br/>
been privvy to that conversation.   Heaven forbid people should get out of<br/>
their cars and actually use the trail systems.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The NPS memo is so wrong-headed on so many levels, you'd need a chart <br/>
to illustrate it.  But among other things, it suggests that they lump <br/>
letterboxers &amp; geocachers together in the same heap.  That's bad news <br/>
for us.  I'm sure most geocachers behave responsibly, but a <br/>
percentage of them don't.<br/>
For example, I learned of a geocache placed near one of my <br/>
letterboxes.  Among the "prizes" placed in the cache was a bottle of <br/>
liquor.  According to a post on the geocache website, a subsequent <br/>
visitor dumped the box &amp; it's contents all over the ground.  If we <br/>
letterboxers start getting linked to that sort of sub-idiotic <br/>
behavior, our days are numbered.<br/>
Also, some state parks &amp; other jurisdictions will likely take their <br/>
cue from whatever the NPS does, so it's a potential headache for all <br/>
of us.<br/>
Geocachers need to begin a serious effort to police themselves, &amp; we <br/>
all need to keep a close eye on developments with the NPS.<br/>

One of the last letterboxing trips I took was a series of 3 boxes. The first<br/>
box, which was missing, is an example of why it is more than "people getting<br/>
out of their cars and actually using the trail systems."  The clue mentioned<br/>
the box was hidden in a hole by some roots of a cedar tree just off the<br/>
trail. What I found was many hole dug in the roots of a number of cedar<br/>
trees. Looks a bit like a badger party gone bad, the ground was torn up all<br/>
over. Not good at all.<br/>
<br/>
If we do not want letterboxing to go the way of the geotrashers it might be<br/>
time to take a close look at our practices. If we are leaving the trail to<br/>
hide a box, we have lost the battle before it starts. Many areas frown on<br/>
people leaving the trail because it makes new trails. I have found a number<br/>
of letterboxes with the help of the new trail leading to it.<br/>
<br/>
Not only do we need to be stealthy when hiding a box but also we need to be<br/>
stealthy when looking for them. The best case would be making it part of<br/>
letterboxing etiquette to not leave the trail to hide a box but to find a<br/>
place within reach from the trail.<br/>

according to Websters dictionary. Trash is more<br/>
closely defined as something discarded, left behind<br/>

description of letterboxes. In fact, when we place, we<br/>
strive to maintain the placement site and any<br/>
environmental impact the box placement might have.<br/>
 My two cents worth.<br/>
