                    <html><body>My son and I recently came accross this diverse group of happy hikers when searching for directions to the rocks on Haycock Mountain in Bucks County, PA  where I occasionally hiked when I was much younger.  An engine search led us to your group.  It's great, all the places around here that I have never been to or have been to but haven't quite seen the way some of you have.  I have some ideas on where to place letterboxes in my area.  Our area is steeped in history and folklore, so it also gives me a reason to bone up on the local legends!  I just have to get busy on carving out some stamps.  Anyhow, just thought I'd voice my gratitude to those who have gone before me and paved the way (or not paved) to some terrific hikes.</body></html>
