Hi guys.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a brand new letterboxer who has been lurking for about a week, and it <br/>
disturbs me to see such nastiness going on for over half of it.  I heard <br/>
that letterboxing was a fun, friendly sport, but I don't see it on this open <br/>
forum.  I realize that over time, list members get to know each other very <br/>
well, and it can sometimes feel like a community of good friends and maybe <br/>
not-so-good friends.  I feel very close with my papermaking group.  Perhaps <br/>
it's a good time for a gentle reminder that your messages are viewed by many <br/>
new people hungry for information as well as the familiar ones who know each <br/>
others' foibles.  I can't be the only new person reading messages this week, <br/>
and the back-biting and nastiness is making me question whether I should be <br/>
here.  If your goal is to encourage and introduce new people to the joys of <br/>
a wonderful sport, why not spread the joy?<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>

You concerns are certainly noted and I can assure you that the <br/>
moderators are having quite a dynamic debate over these same <br/>
concerns. We definately hope you all choose to stay and we realize <br/>
that the negativeness gets to be annoying -- you are certainly not <br/>
alone. <br/>
<br/>
For those who continue to be negative -- Heidi and I mentioned a few <br/>
weeks ago and we will bring it up again. Pllllleeeaassseeee remember <br/>
that this is a **family** hobby. There certainly are children who <br/>
tune into this list and the constant flames and bickering really is <br/>
not something they should be subjected to. <br/>

Hopefully as the nice weather moves in, the energy spent being <br/>
negative will be redirected towards getting out there and boxin!!!<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
What has been going on lately?  All this negative nonsense is really<br/>
starting to get irritating.  And I, for one, would like to see a<br/>
formal apology from all of the combatants.  This is a fantastic group<br/>
of people and should not be subjected to such lunacy.  Even you<br/>
newbies desreve some kind of break!!   Just kidding!!   <br/>
Allaboutthehike and allaboutthedigits, lay off and stop frightening<br/>
people away!!  No one likes a jerk!!  <br/>
<br/>
Now that I've got that off my chest........<br/>
Seth<br/>

<br/>
You don't mention what part of the country you live in......if you type "letterboxing" into the yahoo search engine, (for the site) you will see a list of discussion groups that includes local area groups, such as Texas, So. Calif., Mid-Atlantic, etc.  A lot of people do most of their posting on their local groups. They check this list out for the occasional tip on the technical aspect of boxing, carving, etc, and the placing of new boxes that people post from time to time, in addition to listing them on http://www.letterboxing.org or http://www.atlasquest.com         <br/>
<br/>
People tend to get to know each other better on the local lists, often meet at gatherings, and are generally nicer to each other because they do  get to know each other.    If you want to find out about gatherings, check out   http://www.letterboxing.info   or  http://markandsuepepe.blogspot.com   <br/>
<br/>
For the most part, it's a friendly community where you will meet lots of friendly people. Don't let some of this stuff get to you. I do sometimes and I shouldn't. We should remind ourselves that this is a group with over 2,000 people on it, from all over the country. It represents society as a whole, most good people, a few crummy ones. <br/>
<br/>
You get what you want out of letterboxing and discard the rest. <br/>

Hi and welcome! While I agree that there has been some<br/>
less-then-pleasant interactions here I also think that it has been<br/>
handled pretty well(99.9% of us have moved on) But I also think that<br/>
it is important to note that there are certain tensions and issues<br/>
within the letterboxing community, which as a new letterboxer you may<br/>
not even DREAM of right now! To some people these are big<br/>
issues...there are many reasons to letterbox and different people get<br/>
different things out of the hobby/sport/obsession. I think this<br/>
"friction" is a result of various camps expressing their personal<br/>
preference. Some people are offended by the way some express<br/>
themseleves, but I think it all comes down to courtesy and context.<br/>
<br/>
You will notice there are those who find it exciting to rack up a big<br/>
PFX, those who enjoy the experience of a long challenging hike and<br/>
difficult clues that take weeks to decipher, those who like knowing<br/>
they will find a box by following clues in a new town, and those who<br/>
would rather carve their own stamps. Some could care less if the box<br/>
they find has a store-bought stamp and others will only look for<br/>
hand-carved stamps. There are those who prefer to seek and those who<br/>
prefer to carve and place. Some placers have had very bad experiences<br/>
with careless finders and geocachers and others who place and never<br/>
check on their boxes again. The list goes on and on...<br/>
<br/>
So I hope you are not put off too much by this open forum because<br/>
these discussions bring to light many issues that we as letterboxes<br/>
will have to confront and work to change or improve as more and more<br/>
people become involved in letterboxing. <br/>
