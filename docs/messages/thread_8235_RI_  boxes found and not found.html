yesterday (Oct 6) and looked to see if the Drew clan had replaced box <br/>
#1, also looking in the immediate vicinity, but no dice.  There was a <br/>
kayaking group there at the same time, so we couldn't really look <br/>
where I now know it must be.  Oh well, another day!<br/>
<br/>
We also missed the Frosty Drew box (the nature center and observatory <br/>
were closed).  I'm happy to report, however, that Wanda and Pete's <br/>
"Little Red Schoolhouse" is alive and well.  What a pretty piece of <br/>
woods.  "Porgy" and "Bass" are also in good condition.  All in all a <br/>
beautiful day and nice hikes!<br/>
