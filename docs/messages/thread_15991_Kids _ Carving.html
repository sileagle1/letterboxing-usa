                    <div class="plaintext-content">I confess to having only skimming a lot of recent posts, so this may have <br/>
been mentioned on the discussion about Cub Scouts and letterboxing, but I <br/>
just started a 4-H Letterboxing Club and took the advice of some other <br/>
folks on this list about personal stamps for kids.  Instead of everyone <br/>
carving (the group is 9-12 year olds), I got pre-cut, adhesive-backed foam <br/>
pieces, dumped them out on huge trays and gave each kids a sanded, <br/>
varnished 2"x2" block of wood (1/2" thick) and let them go to town.  Once <br/>
the had a design they were happy with, they stuck it down.  Worked like a <br/>
charm, everyone could work at the same time, no bloody fingers, everybody's <br/>
happy.  (Incidentally, all the attending parents also made personal stamps <br/>
and journals and participated in the group personal stamp exchange and <br/>
finding the first letterbox, so I now have an enthusiastic group of <br/>
volunteers involved).  One of the kids was particularly interested in the <br/>
carving process and needled his mom into stopping on the way home to pick a <br/>
couple pink erasers and he's going to try the "pencil eraser holder" method <br/>
described on the wen site.  During the worst winter months we'll try our <br/>
hand at developing boxes to hide, so kids interested in carving will have <br/>
an opportunity to try their hand then, and there will be time for close <br/>
adult monitoring of the process.<br/>
