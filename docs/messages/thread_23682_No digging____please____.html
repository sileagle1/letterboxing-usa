Okay, now that I've admitted it (again), allow me to clarify and <br/>
retort. <br/>
<br/>
There was a significant crevice under the rock, between it and the <br/>
ground. This is obviously where the letterbox was meant to be. It <br/>
states so in the clues. And the space in the crevice was ALMOST the <br/>
right size, but not quite.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to check the archives, because the "rule" I know says <br/>
you SHOULD NOT disturb the earth to BURY a letterbox. That means you <br/>
should not have to DIG for it when you go FIND it. I disturb the <br/>
earth just by walking on it.<br/>
<br/>
So... it's not like I dug a HOLE in the ground to BURY the box, or <br/>
needed a SHOVEL to move the dirt, or could even QUANTIFY the amount <br/>
of dirt moved around under the rock. The dang box just needed a <br/>
little more room to fit so it would be safe from the rain and better <br/>
hidden from view.<br/>
<br/>
Good grief. I am SOOO sorry to have offended anyone's purist <br/>
sensibilities in the pursuit of making the game happier for the next <br/>
finder... which could have been a first-time letterboxer... or even <br/>
YOU! I, and I'm sure many others, would rather find a letterbox <br/>
that's been well-hidden (have you not been following the thread <br/>
about poorly hidden letterboxes??) and is relatively DRY rather than <br/>
find one that has been vandalized, left open to the elements, and is <br/>
soaking wet because someone didn't want to move a little dirt around <br/>
to make the box more comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Although, in a world where it's easier to point out the negative <br/>
rather than the positive, I guess no good deed goes unpunished, eh? <br/>
I suppose now I'm going to catch hell for the "good deed" I did <br/>
today. Am I going to be told that I shouldn't have taken the SOGGY <br/>
logbook I found today so I could SEND IT BACK to the planter <br/>
(perhaps even dry it first?), and that I shouldn't have REPLACED the <br/>
logbook or given it NEW BAGGIES or rehid the box where it was <br/>
SUPPOSED TO BE (that is, where the directions say it should be, and <br/>
where it was when I found the the FIRST TIME)?<br/>
<br/>
Let's have this be the end of this topic of conversation, please. <br/>
There's no sense in wasting zeros and ones on this anymore.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I often find myself struggling to reconcile the concept of Leave No Trace<br/>
with letterboxing.  Clearly, it is not a leave no trace activity.  Yet, the<br/>
actions we take when hiking, planting, and hunting can go a long way towards<br/>
being good stewards: choosing our hiding locations with attention to<br/>
surrounding vegetation, picking up trash while we walk, not taking a direct<br/>
route to an off-trail box (creates social trails), considering what damage<br/>
someone looking for your box can do and factoring that in to your placement<br/>
and clues, etc, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So is digging a cavity a no-no?  Well, it's certainly not leave no trace.<br/>
But expanding a natural hole so a box fits inside, to be covered snugly by a<br/>
good size rock is probably the best we can hope for in terms of leaving the<br/>
environment looking untouched to those who come after us.  Letterboxes<br/>
covered by a small rock or a bunch of twigs (twigs!) is akin to littering.<br/>
How many boxes do we find that have an entry (or two or three) in the log<br/>
similar to "I stumbled upon your box - neat hobby!"?  Considering that our<br/>
hobby generally involves leaving a plastic container in the woods, I hardly<br/>
think a little digging to create a snug hole is a crime; I actually have<br/>
finally come around in the last few months to thinking it's the lesser of<br/>
many evils when it comes to hiding.<br/>
