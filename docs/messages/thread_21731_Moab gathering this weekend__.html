If anyone is anywhere withing the Southwestern United States this <br/>
weekend and is not heading to Moab, UT, you are missing out on the <br/>
biggest event this region has ever seen.  We are beyond excited about <br/>
our somewhat impromptu gathering and I thought I would just make a <br/>
quick post in case anyone came in that hadn't heard about it and wants <br/>
to attend.  I put the info on the calendar for this list (on the 10th). <br/>
It is called Moab's Box on the Rocks and it should be an absolute <br/>
blast.  At this point we have people coming from at Utah, Colorado, <br/>
Arizona, Idaho, and Montana.  There may be other places as well that <br/>
I'm not aware of.  We would love to have any company we can find!<br/>
