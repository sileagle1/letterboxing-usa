Just wanted a shake down on the plans for March 2nd...<br/>
We are happy to met Wanda and Pete in Easton either outside at the "Weigh <br/>
and Guage" or at the Best Western. We are looking for a time and perhaps an <br/>
idea of who all is planning to get together. Look forward to meeting new and <br/>
old boxers and exchanging stories and stamps!!!<br/>

I too was wondering about the meet time at "Weigh and Guage".  Also can you<br/>
repeat the directions to the Inn and the meet time for that too.  Thanks a<br/>
bunch!!<br/>

ramp (the Old Canal Museum) on Saturday, March 2. <br/>
Kenn &amp; I will be there, with one or two of our borzoi<br/>
companions.  What time is dinner at Raubsville, and<br/>
did anyone rent the Youth Hostel (and if so, where is<br/>
it?)<br/>
<br/>
Did we run into some 'boxers' yesterday?  We were<br/>
walking the canal near the fish ramp and saw two<br/>
couples hanging about, doing some exploring.  Wondered<br/>
if they were planting boxes.<br/>
