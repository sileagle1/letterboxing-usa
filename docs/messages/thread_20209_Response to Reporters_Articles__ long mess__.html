                    <div class="plaintext-content"> I found out about letterboxing after reading an article in Yankee <br/>
mag. 2 to 3 years ago. I seem to remember the Famous Jay Drew figured <br/>
prominently. (Forgive me Jay, if my memory is faulty). The  most <br/>
famous historical reference about letterboxing gaining popularity in <br/>
the U.S. leads one to a Smithsonian mag. article, (if my foggy memory <br/>
serves me right).  <br/>
  We live in a world full of news media, be it print form, via radio, <br/>
t.v., computer.  As one who flies under the modern media radar, am <br/>
probaly missing some form of communication.  People will discover <br/>
letterboxing and that is a good thing!  Why shouldn't they have equal <br/>
access to this wonderful hobby? <br/>
  So, when people discover this incredibly healthy fun hobby, let's <br/>
help them out. The recurring message which has been conveyed here <br/>
time and time again is the importance of education; answering <br/>
questions or referring people with questions to an appropriate <br/>
source. I think a great network of help has been set up. So, let's <br/>
keep on keepin' on. <br/>
  Happy trails!<br/>

  And please trust those who are interviewed to offer intelligent and <br/>
informative info. Well, let me restate that: I trust those who are <br/>
interviewed and who are interviewing to behave professionally and <br/>
rsponsibly. <br/>
