Wales, but I really had to get on after meeting up with the<br/>
moor-tourists (or was it tor-ists) in Dartmoor National Park this<br/>
week.  I was lucky enough to spend a portion of the time they had in<br/>
the UK with them.  Thursday we had a wonderful time meeting with<br/>
Godfrey and Anne Swinscow and a handful of other UK letterboxers to<br/>
learn more about the history of letterboxing here in the UK.  Friday<br/>
we went out on the moor, and I don't think I've been so wet in years.<br/>
 The stories of weather suddenly descending on the Moor are true!  I<br/>
can see how so many are lost out there.  Saturday everyone sadly<br/>
packed up and headed back to the states except for those of us from<br/>
the UK.<br/>

I just wanted to get on the list and publicly thank Mark for inviting<br/>
me with this wonderful group.  Everybody was kind and friendly, and it<br/>
was fun to finally put some faces to names I've known online for<br/>
years.  I only wish my work could have allowed me to come for the full<br/>
week.  It was great fun, and my husband found his first letterbox ever<br/>
on Dartmoor.  You can't beat that.  It has upped my motivation to see<br/>
if I can get letterboxing going more in this region of the country.  I<br/>
believe there are a couple boxes in Wales, now I need to add more . . .<br/>
