but I felt certain she would be horrified to know that her personal<br/>
amanuensis made a couple of small errors in her recent epistle.<br/>
The writing utensil she referenced is actually Mont Blanc (meaning White<br/>
Mountain, the highest peak in Western Europe) rather than<br/>
Monblanc...which would perhaps mean "my blankness"???<br/>
And of course, I'm sure her ladyship's hand - or "main" would be<br/>
feminine, and therefore described as "petite" with a feminine "e"<br/>
ending, n'est-ce pas? (Actually in France, all hands are feminine - even<br/>
the big hairy knuckled ones ;-))<br/>

<br/>
Dearest Mr. Haus,<br/>
<br/>
Her Ladyship has taken her precious time to evaluate the rating <br/>
system you propose and in fact it does not, as we facetiously <br/>
stated, require a secret decoder ring it does however use a decoder <br/>
that requires just a tad more hardware (which can't even be made <br/>
into a smart accessory or jewelry). Her Ladyship thought this <br/>
activity was about creative self-expression as well as enjoying <br/>
Mother Nature's many blessings. If this is indeed the case then dear <br/>
Mr. Costly has made our point for us. Why must we use a string of <br/>
cold unfriendly numbers when we could apply our thinking caps and <br/>
exercise our verbal skills and type an easily understood description <br/>
of the location, which any English speaker can understand? Why must <br/>
we continually replace the written word with numbers and acronyms <br/>
and emoticons? Have we all become so illiterate that we're reduced <br/>
to pointing and numbers and using pictures and guttural sounds to <br/>
communicate? Alas, every teenager her Ladyship has met seems to <br/>
communicate in groans and grunts and eructation so I suppose you may <br/>
be onto something. Her Ladyship however shall continue to poise her <br/>
jeweled Monblanc fountain pen in her graceful, delicate petit main <br/>
over her gilt edged Crane 20lb. rag paper stationary when rating her <br/>
letterbox locations. <br/>
