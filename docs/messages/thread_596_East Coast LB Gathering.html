Thanks for taking the lead in the autumn letterboxing gathering - We've<br/>
got the date penciled in, and look forward to meeting some other<br/>
letterboxers. And, with luck, adding a box or two in the vicinity.<br/>
<br/>
Great job on the Leatherstocking clues - were these hidden with<br/>
knowledge of the powers-that-be? Sounds like another letterbox series in<br/>
the making.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I assume that you  know that the whales tails have now been moved?<br/>
I saw them going southbound on I-89 on Sat. They were off the northbound<br/>
side, and I wasn't able to see if it is a place for travellers to pull<br/>
off. Also, there is a photo in today's (Sunday) Free Press. I'm glad<br/>
they at least stayed in VT.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

&gt; Ginny and I will visit this fall and collect your stamps hopefully and leave<br/>
&gt; one up there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Dear Greg &amp; Ginny,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the comments on the new Adirondack letterboxes, and for <br/>
your recommendations on good hikes/letterbox sites in those parts.<br/>
<br/>
Your writing that you will be coming east in the fall comes just at <br/>
the time when I wanted to let list members know that there is a <br/>
gathering of letterboxers being planned here on the east coast for <br/>
late fall.<br/>
<br/>
There is a wonderful inn in southern Vermont called the Inn at Long <br/>
Trail. My son and I used it as a food cache when we hiked the Long <br/>
Trail last sumer, and our family went to stay there for a week-end <br/>
last November. I began by thinking that it would be a good <br/>
rendez-vous for us and Erik and Susan Davis this fall, then thought <br/>
maybe some other New Englanders might be able to come, then thought, <br/>
well, maybe even Randy or Marty or Ed or John might be able to make <br/>
it up. <br/>
<br/>
So now I'm thinking maybe there might even be some people from <br/>
the mid-west or the far west who could make it, given enough warning!<br/>
<br/>
I put out the suggestion a few weeks ago off-list to about 8 east <br/>
coast letterboxers. The response has been very positive. Based on <br/>
these responses, it looks as though the dates will be Nov. 6-8. This <br/>
week-end works for the inn - they can give us a discount on their <br/>
already-low off-season rates. Just how much I will be negotiating <br/>
sometime this week.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the gist of what I wrote to our east coast contingent:<br/>
<br/>
The inn is cozy and rustic: it has a great common room with a big<br/>
fireplace, a smaller room with board games and TV, a hot tub. and an<br/>
absolutely fantastic Irish pub, with live music each week-end.<br/>
<br/>
The rates are quite reasonable: $68/night for two, which includes<br/>
breakfast. This is the off-season rate - the innkeeper said he could<br/>
give us a discount on this as a group. You can also get two-room<br/>
suites, with fireplaces, if you want to bring kids. My wife and I<br/>
stayed there last November with our 3 kids for about $105.<br/>
<br/>
It is also located right on the Appalachian Trail and the Long Trail,<br/>
so there is great hiking right outside the door. There will be at<br/>
least two letterboxes there on-site by November, and a dozen or so<br/>
more within an hour's drive.<br/>
<br/>
They have a nice dining room, but I don't believe it's open for <br/>
dinner in off-season. The pub, however, has a nice selection of food<br/>
(e.g. Guinness Stew!), which is much less expensive than the dining<br/>
room would be anyway. <br/>
<br/>
It would be possible to come for either one or two nights, by <br/>
yourself, with or without spouse, with or without kids. For people who<br/>
can come Friday night, we could have a number of letterboxing<br/>
expeditions planned for the day on Saturday. Saturday afternoon and<br/>
evening would be a time when we were all together,  beside the fire,<br/>
in the tub, or at the pub. Sunday morning some local letterboxing or<br/>
hiking before people have to take off.<br/>
<br/>
You can check out the inn at its website<br/>
<br/>
http://www.innatlongtrail.com/<br/>
<br/>
So ...<br/>
<br/>
It  looks as though there will be six to ten <br/>
individuals/pairs/families from the east coast at this point. It <br/>
would be wonderful, Greg and Ginnie, if you were able to time an <br/>
east coast trip to coincide with this. And if we could entice any of <br/>
our other occidentals, that would be splendid!!<br/>
<br/>
I will be getting more info out in a week or so on the rates Murray <br/>
and Patty can give us, and on how to go about signing up. Meanwhile, <br/>
please sned me an e-mail, either on or off-list, if you think you <br/>
might be able to come.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I talked with Patty McGrath at the Inn at Long Trail this morning. <br/>
She is looking forward to our gathering in November, and can give us <br/>
a discount on the rooms.<br/>
<br/>
The normal off-season rate for a room is $68; our group can get the <br/>
rooms for $58. This is for two people with breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
If there are people coming by themselves, they may want to arrange <br/>
to share a room. Or not.<br/>
<br/>
Various types of rooms are available: 1 queen, 2 twins, double &amp; <br/>
single, three twins, etc. Bathrooms are shared. Additional charge of <br/>
$10 for a child under 12, $17 if 12 or over.<br/>
<br/>
There are also the 2-room fireplace suites. They are $88/night (no <br/>
discounts available), and have the requirement that you stay for both <br/>
nights. The surcharge for more than 2 people is the same as above. <br/>
These rates do include breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
 We thought it was best to have each of you make your own <br/>
reservations. Just say you are with the letterboxing group.<br/>
<br/>
I think most people will plan to arrive on Saturday, but I know a few <br/>
(including myself) who plan to be there both Friday and Saturday <br/>
nights.<br/>
<br/>
I will be checking in periodically with the Inn to see how <br/>
reservations are going, but it would be helpful if you would let me <br/>
know when you have made reservations, and for which nights. You might <br/>
also give me an indication, particularly if you are arriving Friday <br/>
night, what sort of activities you might like for Saturday: <br/>
letterboxing hunts at the inn, away from the inn, long trail hiking, <br/>
sightseeing around Vermont, etc. Bonnie suggested a mini-course in <br/>
Orienteering skills. Maybe Randy would be willing to do that?<br/>
<br/>
The dates are Nov 5 , 6, &amp; 7, and the website for the Inn is<br/>
<br/>
http://www.innatlongtrail.com/<br/>
<br/>
The intitial response was very good. I really hope we can have a <br/>
large turn-out here; it should be great fun. Bonnie and I agreed the <br/>
other day that it was really nice to be able to attach a face to<br/>
someone you have been corresponding with for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<br/>
Our east coast letterboxing week-end is only one month away, and it <br/>
seemed timely to put out another general invitation on our list.<br/>
<br/>
The gathering will take place at The Inn at Long Trail in Killington, <br/>
Vermont. This inn is a beautiful old spot, located at a height of <br/>
land (Sherburne Pass) on the Appalachian and Long Trails. There are <br/>
great hikes all around (but do bring bright clothing, as it will be <br/>
hunting season!) Inside there are big fireplaces, old pictures and <br/>
posters, game/TV room for kids, a hot tub, and a wonderful Irish pub.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.innatlongtrail.com/<br/>
<br/>
The dates are Friday Nov. 5 to Sunday Nov 7. At this time, six <br/>
parties have made reservations: Tom Cooch (VT), John De Wolf (PA), <br/>
Rae Record (MA), and Royce Cratic (NJ) are coming for both Friday and <br/>
Saturday nights; Erik &amp; Susan Davis (VT) and Bonnie McGloughlin (MA) <br/>
are coming for Saturday night. The Davis's and I will have our <br/>
families there as well. <br/>
<br/>
Those of us who arrive Friday night will most likely be out <br/>
letterboxing during the day Saturday. There are over 60 boxes within <br/>
an hour's drive. I have promised that there will be at least three <br/>
boxes on site, so I need to get busy. Saturday night there will be <br/>
live Irish music in McGrath's Pub. <br/>
<br/>
The innkeepers, Murray and Patty McGrath, have given us $10 off the <br/>
regular off-season rate. Rooms are $58 a night for two people, with <br/>
breakfast included. Additional charges for more than two people. There <br/>
are a variety of room configurations. You should phone the inn to <br/>
make your own reservations, but please do drop me a line if you plan <br/>
to come.<br/>
<br/>
Best of all, IMO, will be the chance for us to talk and get to know <br/>
one another. I'm hoping that some of the old timers on the list who <br/>
have not yet made reservations will find that their schedules are <br/>
free after all. And that some newcomers to the list, who may not have <br/>
heard about this gathering, may also be able to come.<br/>
