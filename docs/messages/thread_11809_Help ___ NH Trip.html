next week.  We are staying at a Bed and Breakfast in Campton.  We <br/>
will be heading up to Franconia and accross to North Conway.  I was <br/>
hoping someone would be able to suggest any letterboxes that are <br/>
nearby.  If you know the area and could point me in the right <br/>
direction I would be much obliged.<br/>

the snow has melted and the road is open.  Also Trish's Tigers at Twilight<br/>
(?)  I think that's the one is a great hike with great views when it is<br/>
clear.  There is also one near Old Man and the Mountain and of course the<br/>
Red Spotted Newt can be found on the way home.  Have a great time.<br/>
