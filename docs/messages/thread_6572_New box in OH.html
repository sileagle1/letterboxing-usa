Adams Lake State Park, West Union, OH <br/>
Adams County<br/>
Difficulty: easy, short gravel trail<br/>
Placed: July 30, 2002<br/>
by kkreations....this is my first letterbox placed!!!<br/>
Please bring your own pen and stamppad.<br/>
<br/>
Driving directions: Adams Lake State Park is one mile north of West <br/>
Union on State Route 41. After turning into the park, drive <br/>
approx. .5 mile and look for a sign on your left: "Adams Lake Prairie <br/>
State Nature Preserve". Park in the parking area on your right. <br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Cross the road to the info board next to the "Nature Preserve" sign. <br/>
Check out the trail map - you will be following the Prairie Dock <br/>
Trail, which begins just beyond the info board. Follow the trail up <br/>
the hill. The trail will split off to your right to make a loop <br/>
around the prairie - do not take the loop, but continue straight up <br/>
the trail. You will pass two info boards on your left as you continue <br/>
walking: the first is about oak trees, the second about ant mounds. <br/>
About 17 paces (2 steps = 1 pace) up the path from the ant mound <br/>
board, you will reach a "Y" in the path. In this "Y" is a large oak <br/>
tree. Standing in the Y in front of this tree, there is a second <br/>
tall, thin oak tree 8 paces directly behind the first oak. You will <br/>
find the small, white box in the trunk of this second tree. Please be <br/>
especially conscious of leaving no trace as this is a nature preserve.<br/>
<br/>
If you have the time, continue on around this short trail to see some <br/>
really nice wildflowers and native plants. Happy Trails!<br/>
