Cedar Box<br/>
<br/>
Placed on November 9, 2002 by hoofandspoke<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION: Taylor Mountain County Park<br/>
<br/>
Nearest City: Hobart<br/>
County: King<br/>
State: Washington<br/>
Country: USA<br/>
<br/>
NOTES<br/>
I hope to have all of my boxes be accessible to<br/>
equestrians, hikers and mtn. bikers. You will need to<br/>
dismount to get to the box, btw.<br/>
<br/>
TREK AND WEATHER FACTORS<br/>
For Summer Clues: Medium 6-7 for hiking difficulty.<br/>
Could be wet in the winter in quite a few spots. As a<br/>
horse ride, this isn't for a pansy show horse, but any<br/>
average horse who is fit should be able to negotiate<br/>
it just fine. Do not use this trailhead in the winter<br/>
if it is marked "Trails Closed." I may supply a<br/>
different set of clues for winter horseback or<br/>
mountain bike access at some point.<br/>
<br/>
For Winter Clues: Easy. Could be wet in the winter in<br/>
a handful of spots. As a horse ride, this one's not<br/>
even worth it unless you plan to explore the rest of<br/>
the trails afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Wheelchair access not available for this series,<br/>
sorry.<br/>
<br/>
RESTRICTIONS<br/>
It's a county park, so dogs should remain on leash at<br/>
all times. Report wildlife (bear and/or cougar)<br/>
sightings to the County. Please use the Winter clues<br/>
if there are trail closures.<br/>
<br/>
TIME TO COMPLETE<br/>
About 2.5 hours for the Summer Clues. Significantly<br/>
less for the Winter Clues. I can't really judge by<br/>
foot for humans. Please let me know and I will update<br/>
this section.<br/>
<br/>
CLUE DIFFICULTY<br/>
Fairly easy is my guess.<br/>
<br/>
STAMP QUALITY<br/>
Medium.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES<br/>
Start at the Alder box.<br/>
<br/>
Continue up the trail east/northeast.<br/>
<br/>
It will wind northerly and then eventually back to the<br/>
west. <br/>
<br/>
After a slight climb, you will start facing more<br/>
northerly again.<br/>
<br/>
When the trail levels off at the top of the climb, you<br/>
will be facing more north again.<br/>
<br/>
You will encounter a section of trail with gravel<br/>
where it straightens out.<br/>
<br/>
On your left you will find a large cedar stump about<br/>
3-4 feet off the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Your treasure is tucked around the corner inside the<br/>
stump, out of site from the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Please make sure the box is tucked out of sight from<br/>
the trail after you have logged in.<br/>
<br/>
To return to where you parked for the Winter Clues,<br/>
continue on the trail to the north. When you cross the<br/>
bridge and come out on the logging road, take a left.<br/>
Stay on this road all the way back to the gate.<br/>
<br/>
To return to where you parked for the Summer Clues,<br/>
continue on the trail to the north. When you cross the<br/>
bridge and come out on the loggin road, take a right.<br/>
When you come to the next loggin road intersection,<br/>
take a left and head back west. This road will take<br/>
you all the way back to the parking area.<br/>
<br/>
Look for clues for my next box to start from Cedar<br/>
Box.<br/>
<br/>
Before you start, please read Waiver of responsibility<br/>
and disclaimer.<br/>
