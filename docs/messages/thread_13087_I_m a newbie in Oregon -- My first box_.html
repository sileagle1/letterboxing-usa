<br/>
I am a veteran stamper of many years (over 1000, my own room, etc.) <br/>
and first heard of letterboxing in England several years ago in a <br/>
rubberstamping magazine.<br/>
<br/>
Some stamping friends &amp; I thought it would be so cool to have here in <br/>
the US but didn't know how to do it or who to contact.<br/>
<br/>
That was the last I heard of it until my mother-in-law emailed me the <br/>
link to http:/www.letterboxing.org.<br/>
<br/>
Last weekend, my husband &amp; I went for the Council Crest box which <br/>
only had 3 clues.  Unfortunately, it was to be in a tree in the very <br/>
public part of the Crest and it was missing.<br/>
<br/>
However, just yesterday, we found our first box!  It is the Japanese <br/>
Garden box by Der Mad Stamper.  It was GREAT!!! It was placed 2 years <br/>
ago and no one had recorded for several months.<br/>
<br/>
We were thrilled to find that a 9-year-old &amp; 11-year-old had <br/>
recorded -- together with their mom.  (If that was inappropriate to <br/>
post, please let me know gently.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to echo another newbie, my husband is thrilled that there is <br/>
a hobby that involves rubber stamping and hiking, so we are both <br/>
interested in it!<br/>
<br/>
I am working on a wonderful 4 box cluster at PCC Rock Creek, that <br/>
involves an anacrostic for each.  What fun!<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know anything you should feel would be helpful, or if <br/>
you're in the Portland area!<br/>

If you haven't been watching the posts since you are new.  There is going to<br/>
be a Portland area gathering, probably in July.  Keep your eyes out for it,<br/>
you won't want to miss an event.  I'm debating if I can make it out without<br/>
taking time out since I will have used up the last of my vacation time two<br/>
weeks before the gathering.  Anybody know how long it takes to drive to<br/>
Portland from either Idaho Falls, Pocatello, or Boise?  Just wondering.<br/>
