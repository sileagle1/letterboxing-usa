first part our "Superhero Series".  This is a nice park with a <br/>
playground for the kids, picnic benches throughout the park and some <br/>
areas for fishing.<br/>
These clues have lots of compass bearings and orienteering clues as <br/>
they were originally hidden for some older Cub Scouts getting ready <br/>
to cross over into the Boy Scouts.<br/>
<br/>
THE "SPIDER'S WEB"<br/>
<br/>
1.  Start your quest at the "slow" sign.  The first compass<br/>
bearing is 0 degrees (Due north) and travel to the picnic table with <br/>
2 trees and a trash can near it.<br/>
<br/>
2.  On the other side of the trash can is a trail, start down the <br/>
trail and don't stop until you reach a fork in the trail.<br/>
<br/>
3.  345 degrees takes you to a new path.  Follow this path until you <br/>
reach a dry creek bed.  Make a left and follow the creek bed to the <br/>
first fallen tree.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Stand facing the fallen tree and look to your right.  There <br/>
stands a smallish tree that has grown twisted.  What you seek lies <br/>
hidden amongst the leaves at the base of that tree.<br/>
<br/>
5.  Stamp in and re-hide the box better than you found it.  <br/>
<br/>
6.  Check out the "Bat Cave" clues for your next letterbox in the <br/>
same park.<br/>
