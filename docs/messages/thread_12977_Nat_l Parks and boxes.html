                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK - I have to defend myself here.  I happen to live on Mount Desert Island, which is home to Acadia National Park.  It is not ALL National Park.  There are plenty of lovely spots on this island and I have placed several letterboxes myself that are on public property.  There is a great deal to this island other than the Park, and I am feeling a bit resentful to be attacked for simply inviting people to Mount Desert Island for a gathering.  My reference to Acadia was for the benefit of those people who may not know that Acadia - a beautiful place to visit - is on Mount Desert Island, which has lots of beautiful, non-park areas for people to enjoy.  As I watch posts on this list I don't usually respond, but it seems to me that people are awfully quick to assume the worst about others and to attack.  Sad, when by and large this seems like such an enjoyable hobby.  Perhaps those who attack should have all their facts straight before attacking.  If I have offended anyone with this reply, I apologize, but to be accused of harming the sport or pushing another letterboxer out by a simple invitation offended me.  'Nuff said.  My offer still stands.  If there are those who would like to come to Mount Desert Island, I would be happy to help organize something.  Within a few more weeks I expect to have planted several more boxes - with permission - so no one has to worry that I am breaking any laws.<br/>

My take of the post was not that you shouldn't gather where ever you <br/>
want, but be careful, as the NPS is aggressively going after folks <br/>
planting letterboxes on NPS land. With this knowledge it would <br/>
certainly not be wise to have a gathering on NPS land if the <br/>
intention is that boxes will be planted there as part of the event. <br/>
Meet where you want, but don't plant on NPS land.<br/>
