Tobiasson Forest is incredibly buggy.  Two applications of insect <br/>

Thanks all CTers for great letterboxing opportunities!  I did not get <br/>
to Daisies in the Woods and Shenipsit Lake because my knees were <br/>
starting to hurt and the bugs were bad.  Another day!<br/>

<br/>
Indeed there is. The "Orange Parrot" letterbox was placed in Crandall Park on <br/>
July 3, 2001, by Churchill and The Pinecone. It is decidedly more difficult <br/>
to find than the other two you mentioned, as it is on a less traveled, less <br/>
well-marked and somewhat more rugged trail. In fact, after finding the box <br/>
and stamping in, I tried to re-trace my steps back down to the main trail(s) <br/>
and completely lost my bearings! It took me several minutes to get properly <br/>
oriented and back on track. But the excellent stamp certainly made the search <br/>
worth the effort.<br/>

Agreed! This is a very rewarding hike in several ways: degree of <br/>
thoughtfulness, variety of landscapes and quantity/quality of letterboxes. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes, that second box is a tricky one...the stone wall is quite looooong! <br/>
Thankfully, no snakes had yet decided to take up residence in the wall on the <br/>
day I was there.<br/>
<br/>
Bonnie, glad you had such a successful and enjoyable day here in CT (Land of <br/>
Letterboxes)!<br/>
<br/>

Glad to know that you enjoyed yourself. Regarding snakes, we have <br/>
seen TOO many this year. I never realized that CT had snakes 4-5 feet <br/>
long. There was one near a letterbox in Union, CT, slithering through <br/>
some blueberry bushes. I gasped, jumped onto a...1 foot high rock, <br/>
and my friend remarked.."oh that snake will never get you way up <br/>
there"  <br/>
