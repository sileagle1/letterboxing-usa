Fisherville Brook. As my daughter and I passed you on the trail, I <br/>
suspected that you might have been the Kurdziel's out to plant their <br/>
two boxes. I had been corresponding with them about sites to hide <br/>
boxes and wasn't aware at the time that they had already planted <br/>
theirs and had posted the clues. My daughter and I were leaving after <br/>
planting one of ours out there. It wasn't until after I had seen your <br/>
stamps in the "Viking Ships at Sunrise" the following day and read <br/>
the post of you finding all four of the Kurdziel's boxes that I <br/>
realized who I had passed. Anyway, I can only apologize for not <br/>
speaking up at the time and hope that by investigating all the <br/>
footprints in the snow by the wall that you might have stumbled <br/>
across our box. But then again, it wasn't mentioned in the post, so <br/>
probably not. It's a good thing that Fisherville Brook is such a nice <br/>
place to return to. Happy New Year. Seeya on the trails, and next <br/>
time I'll speak up.<br/>

be helpful. I think back to a time, I was just about to rehide one of <br/>
the boxes at Trustom Pond when a couple came up the trail. I kind of <br/>
slid the box under my back pack, and had a great conversation with <br/>
this couple for about a half hour, neither of us mentioning <br/>
letterboxing. I couldn't help wondering after they finally left if <br/>
they might have been out looking for the box hidden there. They both <br/>
had small backpacks, too. I hate to find boxes missing, or <br/>
vandalized, so I'm usually pretty quiet about what I'm up to when <br/>
others approach. What a dilemma.<br/>

    I can't believe we passed each other, never knowing we were fellow<br/>
letterboxers.  Whenever we see hikers we always wonder if they are<br/>
letterboxing, so we look to see if they are carrying clues or anything like<br/>
that.  When we passed you I never guessed you guys were letterboxers since<br/>
you were taking the trail in the opposite direction.  We didn't find your<br/>
box that day, but we look forward to returning to Fisherville Brook to find<br/>
it, and explore some more.  We didn't take the Swamp loop or the trail you<br/>
start out on, so it will be great to go back, expecially once the snow<br/>
melts, we'll get a different perspective of the place!<br/>
    I think we saw your stamp at Afternoon on the Amazon.  You are "the wiz"<br/>
right!  By the sound of things the letterbox patches should be here very<br/>
soon.  So, maybe by next weekend we will be identifiable as letterboxers to<br/>
all!  I'm so glad you wrote in!  Now next time, I too will speak up.  Who<br/>
knows how many boxers I have passed by in my travels.<br/>
Happy New Year &amp; Happy Letterboxing!<br/>
See you on the trails!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes Melissa, that was my stamp you and Dan saw at "Afternoon on the <br/>
Amazon". I don't know how many times I've come across your two stamps <br/>
to date, from Jamestown to Mt. Misery. It's funny how we get to know <br/>
the "stamps", but not those connected to them. One aspect of <br/>
letterboxing I'm looking forward to is actually meeting fellow boxers <br/>
and exchanging stamps. Maybe the patches will help.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote to the Kurdziel's after finding their "Afternoon on the <br/>
Amazon" and explained that that was the first, and probably the only <br/>
box that I have found, so to speak, from my easy chair. I moved to <br/>
this area when I was in the fourth grade, and I'm now 43. There's not <br/>
much area in those woods that I don't know. It will be fun using <br/>
Patricia's boxes to teach my daughters a little about compass <br/>
reading, especially since they are in my area. I plan on planting my <br/>
other daughters box,"Gift to Emily", farther down the trail, over by <br/>
the falls, and hope to include it in a loop hike along with the <br/>
Kurdziel's box out there. I also have two hiding spots in mind out at <br/>
Goddard Park, in nearby East Greenwich, and since we and the <br/>
Kurdziel's came up with the idea of planting boxes at Fisherville and <br/>
Ryan Park about the same time, (they beat me to it, however)I'd like <br/>
to invite them to make one of the boxes and work on this one with my <br/>
daughters and I. How about it Trish? Let's get more boxes out around <br/>
here for all those great folks in CT.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the "Gift" boxes to my daughters were made and given by our <br/>
close friends in Virginia, Ladybug, Katybug, and Boop, and let's not <br/>
forget Maggie. They all get credit for the poetry inside.<br/>

Trish, Parker Woodlands has three letterboxes hidden,(Very well, I <br/>
might add) within it's borders. I have a printed clue sheet, or you <br/>
can go to the LBNA site, click on new and scroll to the bottom of the <br/>
page and look into September archives, I believe. It's called <br/>
something like "What to do With Stone", placed by RIBNAG and listed <br/>
as being in Foster, R.I. I may have been the first to find those, if <br/>
not, then second. Seems to me I found the "Star Trek Voyager" out <br/>
there, the surprise that they refer to in the clue sheet for the <br/>
first visitor.<br/>
 Good luck,<br/>
 Bob<br/>
