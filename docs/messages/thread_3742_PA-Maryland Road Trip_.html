success!<br/>
Patience is a virtue, and she likes to letterbox!! A big hug to my very kind <br/>
and forbearing friend :)<br/>
On her suggestion we went "west" from Bethlehem, PA. and then "south" at <br/>
Harrisburg and down into Maryland. A very nice trip and we stamped into <br/>
"Devil's Racecourse", after a brief stop for clarification on a road name at <br/>
the Fort Ritchie Post Office.<br/>
We were warned about poisonous snakes (various kinds, and lots of them!!) by <br/>
the local Post Mistress, and when she asked if we were wearing our snake <br/>
boots, in a very serious manner, we did get a little edgy...<br/>
Being the kind of letterboxer who believes that if we drove this far "we are <br/>
going in for the box" we went, kept our eyes open for belly crawling "big <br/>
fangs", stomped our "snake sticks" as we followed the clues, and joyfully <br/>
stamped in .<br/>
See Joy loves to find the letterbox!!!!!<br/>
Great place!!, (and with a "potty" close by for travelers).<br/>
Next on the list was "Washington Monument" near Boonsboro, found it after <br/>
only one turn around, and it was a great place with an outstanding view on a <br/>
clear day. Way cool monument to GW!!<br/>
It was there that we planted our own Maryland 'box, along with a hitchhiker <br/>
we picked up in PA.<br/>
Ran out of time for "Sugarloaf" so traveled on to our destination. Had a <br/>
great time and this morning on our return back home Floating Feather stamped <br/>
into "Maydale". I found I had been the last to do so this past July! Really <br/>
'boxing folk in MD., you need to get out more..<br/>
Planted one of our own in that fine hidden away little park along with our <br/>
own new hitchhiker...first to find...first to smile!!<br/>
Thanks for the fun "Squirrels"!!!!!<br/>
Clues to follow...<br/>
'box on!!<br/>
See Joy<br/>
