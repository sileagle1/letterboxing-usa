  In case you have not received an answer yet.....<br/>
<br/>
  Upload your picture and post your clue on Atlasquest then go to letterboxing.org and set up your box name and main info.  Rather than putting in clue information enter the link to your atlas quest box in the link box indicated and click the box that will automatically redirect all clue seekers to your atlas quest clues.  That way clue seekers using either site will be directed to your clues and jpeg.  Having your stepchildren run through your clues before posting is a great idea!  Happy hunting and planting. <br/>
