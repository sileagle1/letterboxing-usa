<br/>
How do you know so much about my wedding...or Blanding....or the <br/>
Bullet? Now I know who has been going through my garbage at night! <br/>
Perhaps my ways seem obscure only because of the shady ways you are <br/>
finding out about them. Well let me clear a few things up for you, <br/>
Mr. Paparazzi Private Eye.<br/>
<br/>
Etiquette to me is not spoiling the fun. As the song goes:<br/>
<br/>
While at a soiree in Connecticut<br/>
Ms. Manners invented the etiquette<br/>
But to the dismay <br/>
Of poets today<br/>
It is still a rhyme short of a Limerick<br/>
<br/>
Whatever THAT means is unclear, but what I want to say is that a <br/>
letterbox is a wonderful mysterious treasure. It's sweet to find one <br/>
at all. But how much sweeter to find one that not many people have <br/>
been able to figure out, or hike to, or even drive to. And then to <br/>
open it and see who has stamped. And then to finally see the secret <br/>
stamp that only these finders have seen. To me THAT is fun and it <br/>
spoils it for me if I already know what the stamp looks like because <br/>
I saw it in the newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
That's why I stocked up on etiquette when I went to the Store. And <br/>
that's why I keep my logbook hidden under my kilt at gatherings. <br/>
Granted, I have only logged 5 exchanges, ( it takes a <br/>
dedicated 'boxer to stamp "under the tartan") but I would just hate <br/>
to hand them my book with all those stamps in plain sight. And forget <br/>
about asking me about mystery boxes. I have never ever found a <br/>
mystery box or a WOM. But if I did, I would be as informative as my <br/>
17-year old son after a school dance. (When I asked him who he went <br/>
with, he said, "rosebud" {?!}).<br/>
<br/>
So you see, Frank, it only appears that I have the Store because I <br/>
stocked up on Manners last time I was there. You can say the same <br/>
about any of us here in the Mountain West. We stock up on everything <br/>
because it might be a while before we get back to the Store. If you <br/>
need more clarification on this, talk to my good friend DragonRider. <br/>
He's up in Idaho and has stored up enough manners there to last the <br/>
longest winter.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">well hello there mr.bacon bits,<br/>
boy you sure are making a name for yourself. and not a<br/>
very popular name at that..<br/>
<br/>
so where to start.<br/>
if you are looking for missing manners, you have come<br/>
to the wrong place. here in the mountain west we are<br/>
abundant in manners. we say, yes ma'am and no sir..<br/>
thank you and your welcome. yes please and no thanx.<br/>
<br/>
as for letterboxers in the mountain west, you couldnt<br/>
find a more mannered bunch.<br/>
like my esteemed letterboxing pal, y-nought. he keeps<br/>
his logbook tucked away in places we dont like to talk<br/>
about. i have never seen him just hand out his logbook<br/>
for all the letterboxing public to see.and for the<br/>
mystery letterboxes in the mountain west. there is 1<br/>
mapsurfer box here and i can tell you y-nought has<br/>
never even attempted to give away any hints or help<br/>
for letterboxers seeking these lovely treasures.<br/>
you can ask any letterboxer you come across that<br/>
y-nought is the epitome of stealth and manners.<br/>
i once got the chance to find some letterboxes that<br/>
y-nought had stamped into before me. a series of 3<br/>
boxes in the canyonlands of utah. the boxes were so<br/>
well hidden that i searched and searched for hours to<br/>
find these little gems. he re-hid them so well, i dont<br/>
think a ground squirrel could have found them. and the<br/>
stamp and notes he left were well placed in the<br/>
logbooks so as not to use up too much room.<br/>
<br/>
so what do you have to say about that, mr bacon bits?<br/>
you better be for looking elsewhere for this missing<br/>
"store of good manners".<br/>
it is not here in the mountain west. better get that<br/>
compass to working a little better. try holding it<br/>
away from your body. it might point in the right<br/>
direction then.<br/>
all the best in your search.<br/>
later,dragonrider<br/>
