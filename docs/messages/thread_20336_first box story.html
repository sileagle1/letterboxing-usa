                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh, I know just how you feel.  My first stamp (Fish Out of Water, before it<br/>
earned the suffix "1") was of a pair of dolphins.  I felt bad leaving it all<br/>
vulnerable and alone and when it disappeared a couple months after<br/>
placement....  It was almost a feeling of being violated that someone took<br/>
my first stamp!  (not to mention it was made out of a honkin' good sized<br/>
chunk of the Real Good Stuff!!).  I got over it, and carved a replacement<br/>
(not as big!), but I felt bad again when I left one a couple counties away,<br/>
which I can only visit a few times a year (this one is a buffalo).  But<br/>
again, I'm getting "stronger" the more I place.  I've even sent out<br/>
hitchhikers, and "exported" a stamp to Michigan for placing!  I've found as<br/>
long as I keep an imprinted image in my journal, it doesn't bother me as<br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
Now my next obstacle is cutting a completed image into three pieces for a<br/>
series of boxes along a trail.  I'm waiting until the last possible second<br/>
to do that!  (-:<br/>

Is it just me or do others get a sentamental feeling about placing their<br/>
first box. I know that I felt great about placing my box but as I was<br/>
sitting outside thinking about the day I reflected on my childhood. I<br/>
remember when my father would give me a cookie shaped like a cat I would<br/>
carry that cookie upstairs with my glass of milk and climb into bed. I would<br/>
drink my milk but for some reason I just could not bring myself to eat that<br/>
cookie.... it was a cat!!! I could not "kill" that cookie.... I felt sooo<br/>
bad about it I would cry for 10 to 15 min before I would find a place in my<br/>
room to hide that cookie. Of course days later my parents would find it and<br/>
throw it out not thinking any thing of it but I just knew that the "cat" got<br/>
up in the middle of the night when I was asleep and left the house. The<br/>
reason I bring this up is the little feelings of the kid inside of my<br/>
thinking "I hope that "Bat" is not lonely out there in the<br/>
woods all alone in the dark."<br/>
Now I am a sane man. I am 34 years old.... I know that a little strip of<br/>
carved rubber is not "Lonely" out in a plastic case in the middle of the<br/>
woods.... but I do hope people find him... and respect the contents of the<br/>
box....<br/>
What do you think?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a dog bone kinda like that ---<br/>
<br/>
In memory of my GSP, I wanted to put stamps in each of DuPage County's <br/>
off-leash dog training fields.  For Green Valley, I was going to carve the words <br/>
"Green Valley" inside a dog bone.  But I couldn't get the letters small enough.  <br/>
So I made two halves that will come together to be one big bone -- one half <br/>
saying "Greene," the other half saying "Valley."  Half will go at the dog <br/>
training field, half will go someplace around Tricky Tree Trail. <br/>
<br/>
I started out carving it inside a big paw print and was going to cut the paw <br/>
print in half, but cutting a dog paw in half seemed on the gross side to me <br/>
for some bizarre reason (I mean, it's only a stamp!), so I redid it using a dog <br/>
bone instead of a paw.<br/>
<br/>
I figure that with seven dog training fields in the county, I can eventually <br/>
make a "series" of fourteen stamps, with seven different designs, each related <br/>
to dogs, and each cut in half.  But I only have Greene Valley finished so <br/>
far.  I thought a Vari-Kennel cut in half from top to bottom might work as one <br/>
design, since Vari-Kennels come apart that way.  Gee, I could have a third stamp <br/>
for the door.  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
I just have to make sure I find hiding places that don't appeal to <br/>
leg-liftin' boy-dogs, so there's no risk of my boxes being watered by anything other <br/>
than the local acid rain.  <br/>
