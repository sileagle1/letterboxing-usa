                    <div class="plaintext-content">On October 23, 2001 The Traveling Circus placed the Oregon Zoo<br/>
Letterboxes in the City of Portland, Multnomah County, Oregon. Part of<br/>
the challenge in hiding these boxes was finding suitable places that<br/>
were not well traveled. Since this is such a popular locale, discretion<br/>
is veryimportant when stamping in and replacing the boxes to assure that<br/>
they wont be removed by staff or visitors. All of these boxes are in<br/>
areas open to the public and adjacent to paved pathways. A couple of<br/>
great new exhibits have been opened recently. Check out the Amazon<br/>
Flooded Forest. Since the Zoo needs your bucks in order to keep things<br/>
going, there is usually an admission fee. However, afternoons on the<br/>
second Tuesday of every month are free.<br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: The Zoo is located about two miles west of downtown<br/>
Portland on Highway 26. There is also a Max train station right at the<br/>
Zoo if you prefer to leave the car at home. Once inside the zoo get a<br/>
map.<br/>
<br/>
to the letterboxes:<br/>
The Locomotive Box (stamp by the Plundering Bunny):<br/>
Follow the main road until you meet Panthera Tigris. Stop for a quick<br/>
drink, then about face and head forward 44 paces. Head to your left<br/>
another 30 paces.  You'll find the box beneath the creepers in the<br/>
corner.<br/>
<br/>
Wapiti Box (stamp by Funhog):<br/>
This mammal calls the Northwest home. Find the meadow where Wapiti roam.<br/>
<br/>
Where a sign shows its track, the waiting stamp is at your back.<br/>
Go down the steps and you will see the dead remains of a fallen tree.<br/>
Underneath and behind, the letterbox you will find.<br/>
<br/>
Marsh Box (stamp by Dragondart):</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today, I headed out to the local zoo to visit wildlife and search for <br/>
letterboxes.  What a great little series!  =)  You found some clever <br/>
places to stash them which (hopefully) won't be found and pulled by <br/>
anyone who works there!  I'd have never hidden a series there in fear <br/>
they'd be found and pulled--which is part of the reason I wanted to <br/>
find them ASAP!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of the zoo, they were setting up the ZooLights while I was <br/>
there.  If you get a chance to see them, it's worth the visit.  Even <br/>
if it is below freezing at the time you visit.  =)  (It's not THAT <br/>
cold yet, but it was when I visited ZooLights last year.)<br/>
<br/>
But the boxes:<br/>
<br/>
I believe the Marsh Box is currently inaccessible.  The area it's <br/>
hidden in is closed off for "repairs" for the month of November.  <br/>
*grumble*  So I'll have to go back to catch this one.  (Perhaps I'll <br/>
go to the ZooLights in December.  *smile*)<br/>
<br/>
The Elephant Box needs a new ziplock bag if you come by to visit it.  <br/>
It had a large, unsightly hole in it that won't keep out water very <br/>
well.  I usually bring extras in case they need replacing, but I <br/>
didn't think such a new letterbox would need any!  The pad for this <br/>
one is also falling apart quite quickly.  It's one of those flakey <br/>
bindings where five or six pages fell out just when I picked it up.  <br/>
I don't see it lasting very long and might need replacing relatively <br/>
soon.<br/>
<br/>
Who are the folks that carved the stamps?  They're very good!  We <br/>
need them hiding more boxes!  =)<br/>
