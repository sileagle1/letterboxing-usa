I haven't seen all that many boxes in my area that actually give many<br/>

seems on my compass.  I always set north to zero.<br/>

<br/>
After about four years of letterboxing, if the clues don't work out<br/>
with magnetic north, I figure that the box is probably gone or I've<br/>
totally missed an important step in the process.<br/>
<br/>
Almost every letterbox I've seen with compass directions, is also<br/>
using magnetic north.  I do on my own clues, rather than try to<br/>
include a quick course in compass use.<br/>
