Are you ready to set sail on a three month whaling voyage?  If so, you<br/>
will want to sign on to this lonely whale's trip.<br/>
<br/>
Whale Ho was created as a traditional letter box.  It's location is<br/>
undergoing some renovations and unfortunately had to be removed.  I<br/>
would like to replace Whale Ho when those renovations are complete. <br/>
For the time being however, if you would like to set sail with this<br/>
whale and are able to fulfill the requirements for this journey,<br/>
please respond via email to FivePucks2@aol.com.<br/>
<br/>
Enlistment requirements:<br/>
1.  Do you live in a seaport with ties to the old whaling days? Or<br/>
2.  Is your personal stamp reflective of the whaling industry? <br/>
<br/>
The crew's list for this PLB will be limited to those who can complete<br/>
this journey in three months time.<br/>
<br/>
Ahoy mates and cast Whale Ho on it's journey!<br/>
