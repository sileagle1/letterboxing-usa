IL...a real challenge compared to my first two, involving several <br/>
hours of codebreaking to reveal the directions, then several hours <br/>
of research (including going to a library and finding a few maps) to <br/>
even find the starting location. Then it still took a good tramp <br/>
through the woods and many false starts to find the letterbox. But <br/>
it was certainly worth it! Not only did the challenge add to the fun <br/>
but the stamp was excellent as well-- a real winner, although it is <br/>
unfortunately unnamed (although that really just adds to the <br/>
mystery!)<br/>
<br/>
I'll be interested once I go back to college in DC to see how it <br/>
works in a more urban setting, where there will be more stealth <br/>
required as less mud to tramp through...<br/>
