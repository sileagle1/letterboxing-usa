                    <div class="plaintext-content">Let me just say that I do not condone any "TUDES"  (aka Attitudes) <br/>
promoted or expressed on this list.  But from the new guy <br/>
perspective, everyone needs to learn to handle people with attitudes, <br/>
a little more politically without abandoning ship (leaving the list).<br/>
<br/>
1)  Every list I have been on eventually has someone with an attitude <br/>
show up.  Every single list, or group, or club.  There are literally <br/>
thousands of lists.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Every job that I have ever worked at has someone with an attitude <br/>
that needs to be worked around.  Confronting them just makes them <br/>
fight back.  Better to be passive/ agressive and work around them.  <br/>
Pick your battles.<br/>
<br/>
3)  The list owners (someone is the list owner here) can suspend <br/>
someone for a week or a month, and have them try to correct their <br/>
attitude.  Does anyone know the owner?  Is anyone running the show on <br/>
this list?<br/>
<br/>
4)  Running away (leaving the list) is a very agressive move.  <br/>
Basically flipping off people as you leave the door.  Why not just <br/>
camp out like Gandi!!  And stop responding to the agression.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with this all people.  <br/>
<br/>
P.S.  200 accomplished or 2000 accomplished is a really neat thing, <br/>
but I would rather hear about your top 10 letterboxing locations so I <br/>
could go visit them and share the experience you had.<br/>

If you ever are in Massachusetts you must go to the Birdhouse. It is my <br/>

you're right it was a beautifil spot. Sadly the box had been <br/>
vandalized and there was no stamp. There was a postcard, which I <br/>
mailed to the planter, to make him/her aware of it. Hopefully it's <br/>
been fixed? Regardless of that fact, I still reccommend others make <br/>
the trek! <br/>

The day we went up there, there was a light fog that was blowing over the ridge into the valley which was sunny.  I really regretted not having my camera that day.  : (<br/>
