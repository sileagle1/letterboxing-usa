<br/>
No matter how hard we try, we can NOT seem to get on the road before 11AM!!!<br/>
<br/>
But anyways... Our goal today was to nab 5 of the Connecticut State Park boxes and get our Parks Dept. Patch.  It's a 1 hour and  30 minute drive for us, so we were motivated.... alas it was not to be.<br/>
<br/>
Despite and AWESOME day for boxing, we found only 2.  The Mattatuck State Forest Box was in great shape.  That Arrow Rock is really cool, and it was a really easy box to get.  Almost too easy... I think nabbing such and easy one first made us cocky.<br/>
<br/>
Next was Nassahegon State Forest.  A little tricker, as we misread the directions and wound up in a paint ball area.  AND if it wasn't for the sign, we'd have NEVER known what a Charcoal mound looked like.  Judging from the log book, more than one visitor has made the same mistake. <br/>
<br/>
Next came the American Legion Park.  This is where life really went downhill.... no... literally down hill.    As stated in the directions, the trail head is 1.1 miles past the green fence....ennnnnhhhh wrong answer.  There is indeed a trail/road exactly at 1.1 miles from the fence, but it is NOT the Turkey Vulture Ledge Trail (orange tie blazes...I'll be e-mailing the dept.)  After a rather nice walk the trail begins to head distinctly downhill.  Not being a diehard orienteerers, even WE knew a lookout could not be that low on a mountain.<br/>
<br/>
After walking back uphill we were beat.  We headed for the car and decided before we headed home to drive further up the road..... just out of curiosity.    Low and Behold at exactly 1.3 count 'em THREE miles from the gate, whatta we find.... Turkey Vulture Ledge trail.... I'm not sure if we were happy to find the actual trail, or really disappointed at it being so close.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well,  we can count on that one being an easy find next week.  Hobby... addition... obsession.... you decide.<br/>
