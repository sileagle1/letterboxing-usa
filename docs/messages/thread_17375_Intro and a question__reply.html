can go over a coat. They have lots of pockets all over it that zip or<br/>
close with velcro. Mine has a huge pocket in the back almost like a<br/>
napsack.I have a large clip on the back so I can take the vest off and<br/>
hang it from a branch. You just have to remember which pocket has what<br/>
in it....Chuck and Molly in CT<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm relatively new to letterboxing, with a status of P1 F7.  I had <br/>
&gt; some wonderful first experiences letterboxing over the weekend, the <br/>
&gt; best one being going letterboxing with my parents in one of our <br/>
&gt; favorite spots in Los Angeles (Descando Gardens) and watching my Dad <br/>
&gt; get really excited on the hunt.  It's not everyday when you can show <br/>
&gt; the old man something new ("It's very british," he said!).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am a painter and I live in Las Vegas, Nevada.  You can find out <br/>
&gt; more about me and some of what I do (zines, etc...) at:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://home.earthlink.net/~fundraiserx.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One question I have has to do with I guess my obsession with having <br/>
&gt; a "medicine bag" of sorts for letterboxing.  I'd like some kind of <br/>
&gt; bag that would hold my 5.5" x 8.5" journal, my personal stamp, ink <br/>
&gt; pads, pen and wiping rag (I discovered how wet and messy letterboxing <br/>
&gt; can get when you're trying to manage their stamp-your stamp-your pad-<br/>
&gt; and book all at once.) It would be cool if there was a little plastic <br/>
&gt; window that I could slip a picture of my personal stamp into.  I'm <br/>
&gt; not exactly the world's best seamstress, but wondered if any of you <br/>
&gt; had found something like this that would work or if (?) someone is <br/>
&gt; handy and might want to consider making one for trade or purchase.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That's all for now.  Glad to have found this group.<br/>
