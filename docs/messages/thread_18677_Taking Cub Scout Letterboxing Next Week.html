<br/>
After Teaching my Cub scouts (Webelos level, for those of you <br/>
involved in scouting, 4th grade boys for non-scouters) some very <br/>
basic compassing skills (like how to take and follow a bearing and <br/>
navigating a compass game), I shall be taking them letterboxing to <br/>
some easily found letterboxes that I had visited a few weeks back <br/>
(Fish in Outer Space - Little Lehigh Parkway, Allentown, PA).<br/>
<br/>
What I hope to do is to print off copies of the clues and guiding <br/>
them to the first couple of boxes (no direct instructions, just <br/>
helping to interpret the relatively easy clues), with an option for <br/>
the 3rd if parents and timing agree....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I recently bought 6 cheapo rubber stamps from Wal-Mart <br/>
(earth, sun, moon, stars theme) that they can use as 'personal' <br/>
stamps rather than requiring that they use their own stamps (kind of <br/>
providing a path of least resistance).  I expect that they shall keep <br/>
their stamps.<br/>
<br/>
As I have been to these boxes before, would it be be bad form to <br/>
stamps myself in again?  I had a pre-fab stamp before, but hope to <br/>
have a hand-carved one and a new moniker in time for our little hike.<br/>
<br/>
What do me fellow boxers think?<br/>

want to add a note that you were guiding the scouts. Its nice to see <br/>
repeat finders and folks bringing others by our boxes (for those who <br/>
have placed them). <br/>
<br/>
Usually we'll use our old personal stamps the 2nd time around, while <br/>
using the family stamp the first time through. <br/>
