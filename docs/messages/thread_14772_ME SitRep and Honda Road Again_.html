some letterboxing while we were there!<br/>
<br/>
We found the Nuble Light box with no problem - it gave us some chuckles as we <br/>
attempted to be so cool about getting it and stamping in.  We did see some <br/>
people giving us weird looks, though!<br/>
<br/>
Next we attempted Seahorse at Fort McClary in Kittery/York.  Even though <br/>
we're pretty positive we had all the landmarks right, the box eluded us.<br/>
<br/>
Our next attempt was a bomb as well.  The Lavendar Letterbox at the <br/>
Franciscan Guest House and St. Anthony Monastery was MIA.  The grounds were beautiful, <br/>
though, and worth the trip.<br/>
<br/>
We had brought a hitchhiker to Maine with us from Connecticut, so just HAD to <br/>
do another couple boxes this morning in order to get Honda On the Road Again!<br/>
<br/>
We found both Saco Heath #1 and #2, and left the hitchhiker in this beautiful <br/>
nature preserve.  And, we were the 2nd people to find both of these boxes!<br/>
