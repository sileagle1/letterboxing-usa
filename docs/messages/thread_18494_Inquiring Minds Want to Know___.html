Gwen &amp; I are professional Letterboxers, just send us $10.00 per <br/>
letterbox each time you visit one of our letterboxes and we of <br/>
course will do the same------ sure we will------ trust us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; are some retirees in the group???  (What a cool way to spend <br/>
retirement!)<br/>
<br/>
No, It is VERY cool!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Or is it just the wanderlust that keeps others on the road and <br/>
trail looking<br/>
<br/>
Yes<br/>
<br/>
 Has anyone ever compiled a "profile" of the "average" letterboxer<br/>
&gt; or anything like that??<br/>
<br/>
I do not think there is an average profile. Letterboxers are <br/>
conservatives, liberals,hikers, short hikers, hikers in shorts,tall <br/>
hikers,hunters, non hunters, gun nuts and not.If you could name a <br/>
catagory it would be part of letterboxing, well maybe not couch <br/>
potatoes, or is that potatos.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess I'm just jealous that my life keeps me on a short leash, <br/>
staying<br/>
&gt; home for work or family commitments that keep me from even hitting <br/>

<br/>
I am a stay at home mom with a 20 month old, a 3 year old and a 13 year<br/>
old.  During the day I can't box because the 20 month old can't keep up<br/>
and refuses to be confined (stroller or backpack).  After school is<br/>
homework, chores, volunteer work and soccer practice.  So, no time at<br/>
all during the week.  Weekends also keep us very busy.  If we aren't<br/>
going to a soccer game, then we are running errands or getting things<br/>
done around the house.  My P&amp;F count are also very low... but, we are<br/>
working on getting that higher... hopefully as soon as soccer season<br/>
ends. =]<br/>

Okay, can I ask all you guys a personal question???  All these<br/>
triple-digit<br/>
P's and F's have me curious...What are your day jobs?????  (-:  I know<br/>
some<br/>
of you have mentioned taking grandkids out boxing, so my guess is that<br/>
there<br/>
are some retirees in the group???  (What a cool way to spend<br/>
retirement!)<br/>
Or is it just the wanderlust that keeps others on the road and trail<br/>
looking<br/>
for more?  Has anyone ever compiled a "profile" of the "average"<br/>
letterboxer<br/>
or anything like that??<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm just jealous that my life keeps me on a short leash, staying<br/>
home for work or family commitments that keep me from even hitting the<br/>
double-digits!<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'll just have to live vicariously by reading your<br/>
stories...keep<br/>
'em coming!<br/>
<br/>

opportunities to go out and box.  I live in CT, which is a target rich <br/>
environment.  For example, I will be coming up on my second anniversary on <br/>
Memorial Day weekend 2004 and I have almost 1600 finds.  Those almost 1600 <br/>
finds do not include hitchhikers, which I've stamped into 136.  I've slowed <br/>
down some this year, trying to solve some really hard mystery boxes (I've <br/>
found seven legerdemaine boxes in the last week and a half), and have trips <br/>
planned to find even more.  Also, since school only goes to about 2:30 here, <br/>
I can sometimes go out after school since it doesn't get dark until almost <br/>
7:30.<br/>

&gt;Congrats, Dragon!  (And to think my lowly little boxes helped you achieve<br/>
&gt;this milestone [I peeked in on them the other day].)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Okay, can I ask all you guys a personal question???  All these triple-digit<br/>

&gt;Or is it just the wanderlust that keeps others on the road and trail <br/>
&gt;looking<br/>
&gt;for more?  Has anyone ever compiled a "profile" of the "average" <br/>
&gt;letterboxer<br/>
&gt;or anything like that??<br/>

&gt;I guess I'm just jealous that my life keeps me on a short leash, staying<br/>
