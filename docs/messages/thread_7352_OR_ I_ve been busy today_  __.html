also look for The Cradle. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Doh! We went looking for the Ponytail Falls box today with your <br/>
talklist clues which are slightly less descriptive. From reading the <br/>
new clue page we were in the right general location but didn't find <br/>
it. :( Hope it wasn't the one with the hitchhiker since we have <br/>
still not found one.<br/>
<br/>
It was still a good day since we got Horsetail Falls, the Octopus, <br/>
and Triple Falls. Ginger was happy - she finally went out with the <br/>
family instead of being left on her tie out - she isn't nearly so <br/>
spoiled ever since Grace was born. Grace as always enjoyed "hiking" <br/>
on my back.<br/>
<br/>
The Triple Falls box location is so obvious - I thought that had I <br/>
not even been looking for a box I would have looked there anyway. As <br/>
it turns out the log book is full of folks that did just that. Most <br/>
entries are without stamps and notes that the finder stumbled onto <br/>
the box. The log book is almost full - we've never seen so many <br/>
entires. Some folks drew pictures in lieu of stamps. Some stamped in <br/>
with the box's stamp - using the residual ink. Only a few actual <br/>
letterboxers had found it! LOL!<br/>

Falls box at the same time.  Sorry you missed it, though, but with <br/>
the more descriptive clues, hopefully you'll have more luck!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, the Triple Falls logbook is a joy to read.  Definitely one of <br/>
my favorite ones to read--and a great example of why being the <br/>
first person to find the box isn't what it's cracked up to be.  The <br/>
people who enjoy the box the most are the ones who come to it <br/>
LAST!  =)<br/>

Anyhow.....<br/>
