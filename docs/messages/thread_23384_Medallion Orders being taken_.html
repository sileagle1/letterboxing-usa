 A few months ago we I got 200+  group messages about Geocaching. One<br/>
of the big things in geocaching is Geo-Coins,  Now I get a message seeing<br/>
if I want medallions. Call it a medallions you may BUT it's a coin. <br/>
<br/>
 Which way do we want to go with this. I've been a letterboxer 11 years now and<br/>
I am just fine with the Patches! They are the Letterbox Icon. I thought they were <br/>
done nice and go with our hobby. I think of Coin, I think of Geocaching.<br/>
<br/>
 (Do I REALLY care) Not really, I am just making a point. <br/>
<br/>
 Happy Hiking<br/>
