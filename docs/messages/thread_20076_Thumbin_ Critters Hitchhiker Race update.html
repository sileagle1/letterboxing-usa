                    <div class="plaintext-content">It has been about four weeks since the race began and I thought I'd <br/>
give an update on the critters in this race. (Rosie Ruiz manages to <br/>
remain in the public eye very well on her own, what with all her <br/>
hobnobbing and celebrity drivers... so forgive me for not including <br/>
her :) <br/>
<br/>
Tan Dog, Yellow Kangaroo, Green Hornet, Grey Owl, and Black Bat are <br/>
all currently being transported by various drivers and should land <br/>
soon...<br/>
<br/>
Blue Cat is in Montecito, CA!<br/>
<br/>
Purple Turtle is in Lake Arrowhead, CA!<br/>
<br/>
Pink Pig is in Cupertino, CA!<br/>
<br/>
Of course you'll have to check my blog <br/>
http://hitchhikerrace.blogspot.com/ for the specific letterbox in <br/>
which they wait for you, and please bear in mind that this is only <br/>
the most recent info I have received...<br/>
<br/>
As for Red Bull and Orange Octopus, both have been picked up, but I <br/>
have heard no word from either, so if you have one of them, or know <br/>
someone who does, please drop me a line and let me know they are <br/>
ok... All of these hitchers have contact info laminated and Gorilla <br/>
Glued to both the stamp and the logbook, so even newbies shouldn't be <br/>
too mystified by these little guys...<br/>
<br/>
And as for that rumor about one of the critters arriving in Florida, <br/>
I don't believe it's true, as another boxer I trust claims to have <br/>
the very same one. However, I have heard that one of the racers may <br/>
hit the East Coast soon, so be on the lookout!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening! -Q<br/>
