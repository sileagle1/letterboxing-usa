&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is Laura from Meetup.  I wanted to let you know that your<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing topic is now live.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can check it out, sign up and find details here:<br/>
&gt; * http://letterboxing.meetup.com/<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let's get this off to a great start!  In our experience, we've<br/>
&gt; found two crucial elements for a successful Meetup.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Good Venues.  We've tried to get the best possible venues,<br/>
&gt; but we're not perfect (yet).  If you have any suggestions for<br/>
&gt; venues, you can submit them here:<br/>
&gt; * http://letterboxing.meetup.com/suggest/venue/<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Bigger groups make better Meetups.  Our users have told us<br/>
&gt; meeting 3 other people is great, and meeting 6 is even better<br/>
&gt; If you have a website, post a link about International<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing Meetup Day.  We made some links that you can find<br/>
&gt; here:<br/>
&gt; * http://letterboxing.meetup.com/share/<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Don't forget, Meetup+ members can nominate a venue directly<br/>
&gt; onto the ballot.  They set agenda items and publish notebooks,<br/>
&gt; too.  Meetup+ is a great way to contribute to your Meetup<br/>
&gt; community.  Learn more here:<br/>
&gt; * http://letterboxing.meetup.com/plus/<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you know other Letterboxers, you can invite them along here:<br/>
&gt; * http://letterboxing.meetup.com/tellfriends/<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Finally, post to sites, lists, groups, and discussion boards so<br/>
&gt; other folks can find out about Meetup.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please let me know of any questions, comments, or tips for us.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the suggestion!  Active users like you are helping<br/>
&gt; Meetup thrive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have a great Meetup!<br/>
&gt; Laura<br/>

What:  International Letterboxing Meetup Day<br/>
<br/>
When:  Saturday, December 13 @ 3:00 PM<br/>
<br/>
Goal is to get as many letterboxers as possible together on the same <br/>
day.  Sounds interesting!<br/>
