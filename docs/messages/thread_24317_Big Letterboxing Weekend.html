 From the looks at the traffic he should have a first finder soon. He is <br/>

 He is <br/>

 top of <br/>
 &gt; the Mt. How about that :-)<br/>

and the cops (I work with most of them on nights)  are still trying <br/>
to find out how I did it.  It wasn't really me it was cancer.  <br/>

&gt; Nah, she'd probably collect the boxes and hold them hostage until <br/>
you mowed your lawn. I had a neighbor like that - she is now free of <br/>
her earthly bounds! :) I had nothin' to do with it in case you were <br/>
wondering.  Think she blew an artery or something.<br/>

like to say to heck with the lawn but have a bored old lady next <br/>

&gt;  introduce her to letterboxing.  With the addiction she won't have <br/>
&gt;  time to measure my lawn.  hehe.  <br/>
