weekend, but that was such a beautiful hike I didn't mind.  Saw quite <br/>
a few turtles, frogs, herons - it was wonderful!  All three boxes in <br/>
good shape. <br/>
<br/>
Bit of a warning though - with all this rain several sections of the <br/>
path are flooded.  You can still get to the boxes, but you have to <br/>
leave the trail a few times for some high ground.  We slipped and <br/>
slided quite a bit and almost landed in the water once, but had a <br/>
great time. : )  Thankfully I actually remembered dry socks and shoes <br/>
to change into this time!<br/>
<br/>
One question - the clues say to turn right and go down the path...it <br/>
was a left.  Did we read something wrong?  <br/>

You are correct... the clue should have said LEFT! I have made the <br/>
corrections. Anyone that has already printed the Hemlock Overlook <br/>
clues, make the correction... you are always making Left turns.<br/>
