<br/>
Yeah, really.  I could never grasp the concept either.  Of course, it would <br/>
really confuse the issue if we put "TX" in the subject line ... but that <br/>
means I got the e-mail three hours earlier than you, and I still haven't<br/>
had time to think of a clever response :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If it isn't a joke, it is _truly_ bizarre and still strangely funny to <br/>
&gt; me given the very long history of this commercialization debate.<br/>
<br/>
I think its funnier if its not a joke :-)  I cannot define the word<br/>
"irony" (and I'm not alone -- they couldn't in the movie _Reality<br/>
Bites_ either), but I know it when I see it ... (this fact, more than<br/>
anything else, tells me Steven Pinker's theory of how the mind works<br/>
is correct, but lets not stray too far off-topic :-))<br/>
<br/>
I could write a book right now (whether it be on 'where to draw the growth<br/>
line', or 'business use of letterboxing'), but mercifully I will pass ...<br/>
<br/>
However, there are some unanswered questions (and not about whether or not<br/>
a MarthaLetterboxWalMart will spring up at Calico), and they, and many<br/>
others, will not be answered on the next episode of _Soap_, so here goes ...<br/>
<br/>
* Who in blazes is Martha Stewart anyway?  I guess the fact that I live <br/>
in a cave and don't know the name doesn't mean the individual isn't someone <br/>
to be feared ... and remember, even if it is a hoax, it could still happen<br/>
for real ...<br/>
<br/>
* What is the deal with the tongue sticking out stamp?  Talk about living<br/>
in a cave.  I'm looking at that and feel I'm reading half of a story.<br/>
I get the sense that people want that thread more buried than a good<br/>
mystery box, but at first I thought it was a joke (I'm really bad at<br/>
sorting these things out as well), then it seemed like some sort of deal, <br/>
so someone kindly e-mail me off-list with the gist of that ... curiosity<br/>
does kill.<br/>
<br/>
* What was the third question?  I cannot remember, but I do remember that<br/>
I wanted to drop a clue for one of the boxes _I_ planted for those who <br/>
read this far, but even that may even be frowned upon.  You just can't <br/>
win, it seems (unless you do what you want, always try to have fun, and<br/>
prod the webmasters once in a while (off-list of course; does the whole<br/>
list really need to see it?)) ... so I'll be _real_ subtle and <br/>
obscure ... ITS ON WACHUSETT MOUNTAIN!<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, I guess this thread is dead.  Late as usual, but remember, <br/>
according to my clock, it is not yet a hoax, and I got in a good five <br/>
hours late ...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
