Some of us go seek, others wait for treasures to come to them!<br/>
<br/>
No doubt there is an impressive list of "armchair treasure hunt" activities as well as the more active endeavors of letterboxing and geocaching, metal detecting and so forth...<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like fun for those of us who devour books.  Granted, it can't hold a candle to our beloved clues, carving, and hiking, but I thought it should be noted as an addition to the list of various "finding" activities (i.e. Where's George money bill tracking, benchmarks, etc.).  Perhaps we need to start a list of various activities...<br/>

Bookcrossing is an activity of "losing" or leaving labeled, registered books in public places for others to find and enjoy.  I have not yet participated in this activity but was alerted by a friend...<br/>
<br/>
Anybody out there do this?<br/>

I prefer letterboxing! :)<br/>

There has been a marriage of sorts between postal letterboxing and<br/>
book crossing.  I received a great PLB last week, the Reading Rocks 2<br/>
PLB, which contained books.  We could keep the books that we wanted<br/>
and replace them with similar books.  Tara, who created the PLB,<br/>
encouraged registering the books that we placed with the Bookcrossing<br/>
website.  It was my first PLB and also my first experience with<br/>
bookcrossing and I am gathering the books that I have read and hope to<br/>
scatter them while I am out planting boxes now.<br/>
