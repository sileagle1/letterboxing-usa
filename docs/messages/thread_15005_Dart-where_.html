I have to agree with Jay on this one.  I do not want my boxes, nor my <br/>

I understand the desire to want to track the status of boxes, so you know if <br/>
it's worth trying (we do search the archive at times for certain boxes), but <br/>
wasn't the point of all this to get off our butts, go outside and enjoy the day <br/>
and the company?<br/>

Mahjong, nothing personal.  I believe you created this with the very <br/>

there who appreciate your efforts.  I'm not asking for the database <br/>

This is right where I stand -- with CSCM and Jay.  Although I <br/>
personally do not feel the need or the desire for it, there seem to <br/>
be a lot of people who want some kind of status reporting.  Mahjong <br/>
did a very nice job on the database and I would rather see the status <br/>
updates off the list in a database than on-list.<br/>
<br/>
I am not going to attempt to say that people cannot report status of <br/>
my boxes in the database, however I will not be using the database <br/>
myself.  I prefer to make direct contact with the box placer when <br/>
status information needs to be exchanged.<br/>
<br/>
The "challenge" is about solving clues and finding letterboxes.<br/>

<br/>
Just a passing thought. Did anyone pass this database concept by the <br/>
list owner or moderators for their input or, minimally, query the <br/>
group via a poll for consensus before putting it up? I don't recall <br/>
seeing an opportunity for anyone's input before it just appeared, <br/>
albeit, I'm sure, with the best of intentions. <br/>
<br/>
I would certainly hope that a mention of any of my few boxes would <br/>
never be made on the "database." Did I read anyone could delete <br/>
anything there? <br/>

Just a quick note on a one point here, it's NOT geocaching style of reporting...  As a webmaster and website creator, I am very interested in how sites are put together.  The database at the yahoo groups site is nothing like the geocaching website or that style of reporting.  If it were, then we'd not need any type of clues at all, we'd simply use my new Nextel phone (That comes GPS enabled) and get to within 15 feet of the location of the box and flail away madly without regard for the environment....<br/>
<br/>
I compare it this way..... Letterboxers are the silent stealthy foxes of the world, hardly seen when they grab a target, whereas Goechachers are, in my not so humble opinion, akin to a herd of slightly myopic, partially dyslexic elephants that have to thrash around for 50 feet in all directions to locate the prize, usually located in an object the size a small child, filled with trinkets the Indians would have scoffed at.  Not that I have anything against anyone you see......<br/>
<br/>
This database, while in it's infancy, is something that's going to stir the emotions of everyone... Much as most anything posted here does... We are, after all, the fanatical ones about our chosen hobby and we don't like change for the most part.  Not that change is good or bad, just that most humans are more comfortable if things don't change.<br/>
<br/>
I for one do not like the DB because it lets someone who gave up, for whatever reason, update the status of the box incorrectly.  The database at the main website is to limited, again, in my not so humble opinion.  What's needed is something that melds the two together.<br/>

   I feel that the database is a serious breach of letterboxing <br/>

&gt;Subject: [LbNA] Re: Dart-where?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;From what I have heard, there is a game played in England, particularly in<br/>
&gt;Dartmoor National Park, bearing a faint resemblance to the<br/>
&gt;hobby we call letterboxing.  It is called...  letterboxing!  Seeing as how<br/>
it has<br/>
&gt;actually been around for over a hundred years, technically it<br/>
&gt;is "the original."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It's this type of tongue in cheek that many on this list seem to take as a<br/>
sarcastic tone of voice.  Most everyone should know that this hobby came<br/>
from Dartmoor, if they don't then I'm sure that someone will point it out to<br/>
them in a less tongue in cheek manner.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The primary difference is the mystique.  In the crusty, dusty old rendition<br/>
of<br/>
&gt;the game, just getting your hands on clues to letterboxes was<br/>
&gt;often challenging.  Deciphering the sparse, cryptic notations once you did<br/>
get<br/>
&gt;them, was rarely as easy as 1-2-3, and even after spending<br/>
&gt;weeks/months/years solving a clue, one may journey considerable distance<br/>
&gt;to the location and find the box no longer in existance.  But in<br/>
&gt;such instance, where a player has put significant effort into solving the<br/>
clue,<br/>
&gt;there is still a great satisfaction, even though there is no box.<br/>
&gt;The reward in this game is mastering the challenge, not necessarily the<br/>
stamp<br/>
&gt;in the log book.  In this version of the game, there is a<br/>
&gt;respect for other players, particularly those who have been playing the<br/>
game<br/>
&gt;for a while (I guess these would be those that are known<br/>
&gt;today as "oldies").  I know, you are thinking...  say it isn't so, but it<br/>
is!<br/>
<br/>
I've one simple question here, asked in all humility and deference... how<br/>
does one master the challenge if they can not locate the end, or the prize,<br/>
or at least a sign that they have in fact, mastered the challenge?  By the<br/>
simple fact that they assume they were correct in the translation?  If<br/>
that's so, then I get the gold and silver buried at the Desprado in the west<br/>
somewhere becuase I think I've gotten that muystery all figured out.  Oh,<br/>
wait... That's right... If I do figure it out, I DO get all the gold and<br/>
silver buried there.  Here, if someone or something vandalizes a box and I<br/>
drive 3+ hours, as I will be this Wed, to get to the location, that's too<br/>
bad, it's all a part of the sport, right?  3 hours of wear and tear on my<br/>
car, the gas and food I speant money on to get there and all for what? So I<br/>
could prove I was able to decipher the clues correctly, I think?  I'm not<br/>
asking for big bright neon signs, pointing like fingers of god at the<br/>
location of the box. Nor am I asking for clues that say, "Walk up to the<br/>
ranger station and ask for the stamp." either. But I am asking for someway<br/>
of indicating that the box is in trouble or at least suspected of being so.<br/>
I went on the 9th to Tumwater Falls here in Washington State and we came<br/>
across a box that had been vandalized and the stump it was in severly<br/>
damaged.  We contacted the placer, only becuase we know them and had just<br/>
seen them at the gathering.  Now, if anyone else goes after that box, by<br/>
your words, it's ok, they at least figured upt the clues, correct?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You may wonder just how that game is akin to the letterboxing of today?<br/>
&gt;The stamp, the log book, the little water-tight container...  the<br/>
&gt;palpable pieces are actually quite similar.  Unfortunately, the<br/>
intangibles,<br/>
&gt;those things which are truly the heart and spirit of the game, have<br/>
&gt;been all but lost and replaced with "letterbox-by-number" style clues,<br/>
&gt;easy enough for the average eight-year old to walk right up to the<br/>
&gt;box and add another "F" to his count in a matter of a few minutes.  And<br/>
&gt;since everybody knows that the average eight-year old has much<br/>
&gt;better things to do with his time than take short walks to letterboxes that<br/>
&gt;no longer exist, today's version of the game has been modified to<br/>
&gt;provide players with up-to-date status information of boxes, thus making<br/>
&gt;it easier to determine which set of directions will give the best<br/>
&gt;chance of rewarding a player with an "F".<br/>
&gt;<br/>
I'll say this much on this last part and please do not take offense at my<br/>
words, they are not intended to be sarcastic or mean, they are, after all,<br/>
only words.  I'm sure my first boxes are going to be easy. I'm not as<br/>
skilled as other folks are. But I will be and I will gladly read posts that<br/>
say that they searched for hours and couldn't find it, only to go back and<br/>
almost walk over it.  We all get better as we pratice.  but, before you<br/>
condem the abilities of others, please remember that we are a product of the<br/>
society that we grew up in.  The fellows of Dartmoor back in the late 1800's<br/>
thought and acted differently than we do today.  Back then, I feel certain<br/>
that the majority of damage done to boxes was by animals, not by drunken<br/>
teenagers foraging around for a place to have sex at.  And no, the<br/>
intangables have not been lost, it's just that no one teaches them anymore.<br/>
No one teaches new people how to do this sport for the most part... Now a<br/>
days, when a new person asks a question, for the most part, other than a<br/>
simple welcome to the group message, they then get a "Welll, if you're to<br/>
lazy to read the FAQ's, it's not my fault."  Truth be known, not many are<br/>
teachers nor have that temperment, to deal with the same question, day,<br/>
after day, after day, after day.  If you don't like the<br/>
Letterbox-by-Numbers, then help train the new persons to make it better for<br/>
all to enjoy.  Providing up to the date status's is, in my NOT so humble<br/>
opinion, a good way for someone who's juggling kids, strollers, and limited<br/>
time, to best be able to determine if thier time is being speant wisely or<br/>
if they should forgo that box till later.  And the only person that should<br/>
be doing the status of a box is the owner of that box, not some lost person<br/>
who couldn't find thier way out of a wet paper bag with a compass and the<br/>
other end open.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The "new and improved" version is available now at a location near you<br/>
&gt;(and since you are in CT, it is actually waiting just outside your<br/>
&gt;front door).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hobbies evolve over time.  If letterboxing had not evolved, there are a number<br/>
of things that are taken for granted as traditional letterboxing that would not<br/>
be in use.  Some examples:<br/>
<br/>
1)  No waterproof plastic boxes.  We would be using wood boxes or glass bottles<br/>
and dealing with soggy messes.<br/>
2)  Wood cuts would be used for stamps.  No Mastercarve or pink stuff.<br/>
3)  Holes all over the place.  From what I understand, some of the originals<br/>
were placed in holes dug into the ground which is mostly not done here in the<br/>
States.<br/>
4)  No LBNA website.  We would have to either know someone who knew where a box<br/>
was or would have to buy a book.<br/>
5)  We wouldn't even use stamps!  We would be sticking our calling cards into<br/>
glass bottles!!!<br/>
<br/>
I am sure that there are people who still do some of the above and there is<br/>
nothing to say that they are wrong for doing so.  I think it is a good thing<br/>
when people keep traditions alive and those of you who believe in a more<br/>
traditional way of doing things should keep doing it.<br/>
<br/>
With the evolution of this hobby there will come good (waterproof containers!)<br/>
and bad (fill in your pet peeve here) but it will evolve and change no matter<br/>
what any one person does.  They can only do their best to enjoy the hobby in the<br/>
way they like and keep their own traditions alive.<br/>

I didn't have a problem with that, why do you think I did?  I merely attempted to ensure that you did not take offense at my words, that's all.  If you have a problem with that, then perhaps we could meet offlist and discuss that?  I was adding my 2 cents worth, as you did as well.<br/>

  &gt; &gt;Dartmoor National Park, bearing a faint resemblance to the<br/>
  &gt; &gt;hobby we call letterboxing.  It is called...  letterboxing!  <br/>
  Seeing as how<br/>
  &gt; it has<br/>
  &gt; &gt;actually been around for over a hundred years, technically it<br/>
  &gt; &gt;is "the original."<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; It's this type of tongue in cheek that many on this list seem to <br/>
  take as a<br/>
  &gt; sarcastic tone of voice.  Most everyone should know that this hobby <br/>
  came<br/>
  &gt; from Dartmoor, if they don't then I'm sure that someone will point <br/>
  it out to<br/>
  &gt; them in a less tongue in cheek manner.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt;The primary difference is the mystique.  In the crusty, dusty old <br/>
  rendition<br/>
  &gt; of<br/>
  &gt; &gt;the game, just getting your hands on clues to letterboxes was<br/>
  &gt; &gt;often challenging.  Deciphering the sparse, cryptic notations once <br/>
  you did<br/>
  &gt; get<br/>
  &gt; &gt;them, was rarely as easy as 1-2-3, and even after spending<br/>
  &gt; &gt;weeks/months/years solving a clue, one may journey considerable <br/>
  distance<br/>
  &gt; &gt;to the location and find the box no longer in existance.  But in<br/>
  &gt; &gt;such instance, where a player has put significant effort into <br/>
  solving the<br/>
  &gt; clue,<br/>
  &gt; &gt;there is still a great satisfaction, even though there is no box.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;The reward in this game is mastering the challenge, not <br/>
  necessarily the<br/>
  &gt; stamp<br/>
  &gt; &gt;in the log book.  In this version of the game, there is a<br/>
  &gt; &gt;respect for other players, particularly those who have been <br/>
  playing the<br/>
  &gt; game<br/>
  &gt; &gt;for a while (I guess these would be those that are known<br/>
  &gt; &gt;today as "oldies").  I know, you are thinking...  say it isn't so, <br/>
  but it<br/>
  &gt; is!<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I've one simple question here, asked in all humility and <br/>
  deference... how<br/>
  &gt; does one master the challenge if they can not locate the end, or <br/>
  the prize,<br/>
  &gt; or at least a sign that they have in fact, mastered the challenge?  <br/>
  By the<br/>
  &gt; simple fact that they assume they were correct in the translation?  <br/>
  If<br/>
  &gt; that's so, then I get the gold and silver buried at the Desprado in <br/>
  the west<br/>
  &gt; somewhere becuase I think I've gotten that muystery all figured <br/>
  out.  Oh,<br/>
  &gt; wait... That's right... If I do figure it out, I DO get all the <br/>
  gold and<br/>
  &gt; silver buried there.  Here, if someone or something vandalizes a <br/>
  box and I<br/>
  &gt; drive 3+ hours, as I will be this Wed, to get to the location, <br/>
  that's too<br/>
  &gt; bad, it's all a part of the sport, right?  3 hours of wear and tear <br/>
  on my<br/>
  &gt; car, the gas and food I speant money on to get there and all for <br/>
  what? So I<br/>
  &gt; could prove I was able to decipher the clues correctly, I think?  <br/>
  I'm not<br/>
  &gt; asking for big bright neon signs, pointing like fingers of god at <br/>
  the<br/>
  &gt; location of the box. Nor am I asking for clues that say, "Walk up <br/>
  to the<br/>
  &gt; ranger station and ask for the stamp." either. But I am asking for <br/>
  someway<br/>
  &gt; of indicating that the box is in trouble or at least suspected of <br/>
  being so.<br/>
  &gt; I went on the 9th to Tumwater Falls here in Washington State and we <br/>
  came<br/>
  &gt; across a box that had been vandalized and the stump it was in <br/>
  severly<br/>
  &gt; damaged.  We contacted the placer, only becuase we know them and <br/>
  had just<br/>
  &gt; seen them at the gathering.  Now, if anyone else goes after that <br/>
  box, by<br/>
  &gt; your words, it's ok, they at least figured upt the clues, correct?<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;You may wonder just how that game is akin to the letterboxing of <br/>
  today?<br/>
  &gt; &gt;The stamp, the log book, the little water-tight container...  the<br/>
  &gt; &gt;palpable pieces are actually quite similar.  Unfortunately, the<br/>
  &gt; intangibles,<br/>
  &gt; &gt;those things which are truly the heart and spirit of the game, have<br/>
  &gt; &gt;been all but lost and replaced with "letterbox-by-number" style <br/>
  clues,<br/>
  &gt; &gt;easy enough for the average eight-year old to walk right up to the<br/>
  &gt; &gt;box and add another "F" to his count in a matter of a few <br/>
  minutes.  And<br/>
  &gt; &gt;since everybody knows that the average eight-year old has much<br/>
  &gt; &gt;better things to do with his time than take short walks to <br/>
  letterboxes that<br/>
  &gt; &gt;no longer exist, today's version of the game has been modified to<br/>
  &gt; &gt;provide players with up-to-date status information of boxes, thus <br/>
  making<br/>
  &gt; &gt;it easier to determine which set of directions will give the best<br/>
  &gt; &gt;chance of rewarding a player with an "F".<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I'll say this much on this last part and please do not take offense <br/>
  at my<br/>
  &gt; words, they are not intended to be sarcastic or mean, they are, <br/>
  after all,<br/>
  &gt; only words.  I'm sure my first boxes are going to be easy. I'm not <br/>
  as<br/>
  &gt; skilled as other folks are. But I will be and I will gladly read <br/>
  posts that<br/>
  &gt; say that they searched for hours and couldn't find it, only to go <br/>
  back and<br/>
  &gt; almost walk over it.  We all get better as we pratice.  but, before <br/>
  you<br/>
  &gt; condem the abilities of others, please remember that we are a <br/>
  product of the<br/>
  &gt; society that we grew up in.  The fellows of Dartmoor back in the <br/>
  late 1800's<br/>
  &gt; thought and acted differently than we do today.  Back then, I feel <br/>
  certain<br/>
  &gt; that the majority of damage done to boxes was by animals, not by <br/>
  drunken<br/>
  &gt; teenagers foraging around for a place to have sex at.  And no, the<br/>
  &gt; intangables have not been lost, it's just that no one teaches them <br/>
  anymore.<br/>
  &gt; No one teaches new people how to do this sport for the most part... <br/>
  Now a<br/>
  &gt; days, when a new person asks a question, for the most part, other <br/>
  than a<br/>
  &gt; simple welcome to the group message, they then get a "Welll, if <br/>
  you're to<br/>
  &gt; lazy to read the FAQ's, it's not my fault."  Truth be known, not <br/>
  many are<br/>
  &gt; teachers nor have that temperment, to deal with the same question, <br/>
  day,<br/>
  &gt; after day, after day, after day.  If you don't like the<br/>
  &gt; Letterbox-by-Numbers, then help train the new persons to make it <br/>
  better for<br/>
  &gt; all to enjoy.  Providing up to the date status's is, in my NOT so <br/>
  humble<br/>
  &gt; opinion, a good way for someone who's juggling kids, strollers, and <br/>
  limited<br/>
  &gt; time, to best be able to determine if thier time is being speant <br/>
  wisely or<br/>
  &gt; if they should forgo that box till later.  And the only person that <br/>
  should<br/>
  &gt; be doing the status of a box is the owner of that box, not some <br/>
  lost person<br/>
  &gt; who couldn't find thier way out of a wet paper bag with a compass <br/>
  and the<br/>
  &gt; other end open.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;The "new and improved" version is available now at a location near <br/>
  you<br/>
  &gt; &gt;(and since you are in CT, it is actually waiting just outside your<br/>
  &gt; &gt;front door).<br/>
  &gt; Just to 2.8 cents worth.<br/>

Couple of thoughts prefaced by my personal opinion that I am 100% on <br/>
board with Jay, Spring Chick and Alafair on this. We've got only 17 <br/>
placed and I'd not like to see any on the database. <br/>
<br/>
Please keep in mind that there are MANY bonus boxes out there, many <br/>
mysteries, many cuckoo clues, and many non-published clues. There's <br/>
ways to let folks know you've obtained them; example being that I <br/>
mentioned last week we had solved Ray's Dilemma. I did not mention <br/>
the other boxes we found that day because I'm NOT about to give up <br/>
the location of this box and (if there were other's near it) any <br/>
nearby boxes. <br/>
<br/>
If you're soooooo concerned about vandalized boxes then start <br/>
promoting personal websites and better upkeep and monitoring of <br/>
boxes. Using Jay Drew as an example - look at his website. There's <br/>
plenty of boxes on there that are missing and he updates that they <br/>
are, indeed, missing. Thats the way things ought to be done. Should I <br/>
find out a box of mine is missing or vandalized; I'll gladly post it <br/>
on my web page as missing, reported missing but not confirmed, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
My true fear is someone posting on the database that they found XYZ <br/>
Bonus at the Flabberjabber Box in East Whateveryacallit, Connecticut <br/>
on a certain day....and spoiling it for the rest of us.  I've spent 8 <br/>
months trying to crack certain mysteries, gotten 1/2 done and hit a <br/>
roadblock and needed a hint to pass the bump.  Those boxes are the <br/>
stamps I treasure most. I've also sat down with other boxers and <br/>
discussed and hashed out locations before.  It is indeed satisfying.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think if I were driving 3 hours for one box...I'd make sure i knew <br/>
of others in the area so I didn't do it all for naught. I'd also do <br/>
some reseach through the archives and see who found it last, etc.  <br/>

Jay's opinion has always held great weight for me and for good reason.<br/>
<br/>
   I feel that the database is a serious breach of letterboxing etiquette.  It undermines the personal responsibility of the placer of the box.  So what if a placer never checks it again.  It's out there for your enjoyment, or is it? ;).  Isn't that the fun of it?  <br/>

&gt; Is there a way to opt out of having our own letterboxes tracked <br/>
there?<br/>
<end quotes=""><br/>
<br/>
I, too, put much weight in Jay's opinion, not just because he was a LB pioneer in the US, but because I have corresponded with him and met him personally at a gathering.  I like him and respect him.  I think he has a great head on his shoulders and I don't detect even the slightest bit of anything negative about him and his desire to keep his boxes off the database.  He has his reasons and I will try my best to refrain from ever posting anything about his boxes other than that I found it or didn't, and I'll do so here on the list, or write to him personally.  It's a fair request.  <br/>
<br/>
Next,<br/>
<br/>
I haven't checked out the database and I'm not sure how wisely it will be used.  That's always a risk when you opt for a least-restrictive environment; you have to really on the good judgment of others and it may not turn be very good, in your own opinion.  I'm very much in the "we don't need more rules" camp, but probably because I think my *own* set of rules for myself are really quite okay, and I trust that if I step on toes I'd be politely informed of my transgressions, and forgiven if I don't cop an attitude.<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, I'd treat any other placer the same as I would Jay, Wanda and Pete, Trish,  etc., and only post that I failed to find a box or that it was damaged, etc.  If a posting doesn't get a heads-up response from either the placer or another boxer, then I'll try to contact the placer off the list.  What I mean by a response from another boxer is a "me, too" or <br/>
possibly a "hey, we already talked about that one on list and it's been..."  And why I listed those particular placers is not only because I have gone after many of their boxes and they are local to me.  Even before I personally met any of them at a gathering, I felt the same way: they have been doing this much longer and way better than I have, so they are not only deserving of common courtesy but deserving of my respect and consideration as veterans and mentors. <br/>
<br/>
<apple off="" shining=""> :-)<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, letterboxing is growing at an astounding rate, mostly due to published articles in magazines with a huge readership.  It worries me.  When I first was told about LBing, it was in a tete-a-tete email with Ben of RIBNAG.  I was actually flattered that he considered me worthy of knowing about the sport.  From the beginning I felt that there was a trust required, that we all had to be coming from the same place as far as intention and attitude.  I was extremely selective about who I "let in" on it.  <br/>
<br/>
Now things are much more open and I've told people that I don't know *really* well about LBing, but if it seems to pique their interest, I do try to express that it's important to respect the desire of the placers as well as respect the environment.  I don't know how well that respect and concern for other boxers and the outdoors is conveyed through magazine and newspaper articles.  I'm not assuming that everyone that hears about LBing in a non-personal way will spoil it, but I cannot assume that they won't.  <br/>
<br/>
I can't assume that the database will take away the secretive allure of boxing or spoil others' fun, but I can't assume that it won't.  I can certainly appreciate Mahjong's intention and I respect the opinion of those, such as Phyto of Maine, who feel the need of the database.  My opinion, as with everything related to letterboxing is HANDLE WITH CARE.  Please respect the placer of the boxes and try not to post anything they would not want others to read.  Err to the side of caution, please.<br/>

  I didn't have a problem with that, why do you think I did?  I merely attempted to ensure that you did not take offense at my words, that's all.  If you have a problem with that, then perhaps we could meet offlist and discuss that?  I was adding my 2 cents worth, as you did as well.<br/>

&gt; Would you mind explaining why you don't like it? I am not seasoned <br/>
enough to<br/>
&gt; know the finer points yet.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking! Well, it's not my place to say "do it this way," <br/>
or "don't play like that," but to me having a database of comments <br/>
written about certain letterboxes detracts from the enjoyment. There <br/>
_could_ be a sense of mystery and intrigue associated with <br/>
letterboxing. The graphics of the LbNA website are intended to <br/>
promote that atmosphere, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
1) I think most MIA reports are wrong. I used to track <br/>
incorrect "it's missing" notes in my PFX count. I stopped when I <br/>
could statistically say that I was getting 13 mistaken MIAs for every <br/>
true, confirmable one. While I think the missing reports I've been <br/>
getting recently are more accurate, I think a database of MIA reports <br/>
does an injustice to letterboxing in general.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the authors of letterboxes create a magical and distinct <br/>
experience. So someone else's comments alluding to "that massive mud <br/>
pit" or "her distances are way off," while perhaps useful to the next <br/>
person coming along, may not be welcomed by the one who's creativity <br/>
went into it in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
2) Do we really need it? Everyone now has the capability to instantly <br/>
update their clues with status stuff. You could even have a little <br/>
section where you clip in the comments other people make on the big <br/>
group (or your local group, or off-line...we have had a section like <br/>
that on our own website for years).<br/>
<br/>
Like you all, I'm also a consumer of this info: while planning for a <br/>
recent trip I was very thankful for the conscientious way some people <br/>
kept their clues up to date. Some even had "last found on" with <br/>
specific dates. Nice. And it was done by the authors.<br/>
<br/>
3) The yahoogroup database is there, and it's sort of free, but it's <br/>
not a very good one. It's clunky. You can't query it intelligently <br/>
(ie, I can't pull info on JeLyBean letterboxes in New York), and it <br/>
doesn't handle longer comments easily (all fields are the same size). <br/>
It looks like it would take a complex and arcane secret shorthand to <br/>
work. The couple hundred records in there now are arranged <br/>
alphabetically by letterbox name, and I can see 10 or 15 at a time. <br/>
Even with my cranky dial-up, it only takes a couple of minutes to <br/>
scroll through them all, but if I edit a record starting with M, when <br/>
I'm done the database returns me to square one at A. It's not a very <br/>
good base to build data on.<br/>
<br/>
So, even though there has long been demand from the letterboxing <br/>
community for clear cut status reports, there isn't a function like <br/>
this on the LbNA site. Ever wonder why? In part, it is because the <br/>
founders of letterboxing didn't think it fit well with the milieu. <br/>
That doesn't mean you can't go ahead and create it. Mischief's <br/>
Washington site has a status function that is well recieved by the <br/>
PNW folks. Pete &amp; Wanda will track your hitch hikers for you while <br/>
LbNA won't. Perhaps someone someday will program a better mousetrap: <br/>
like the letterboxes I place, I don't think this central LbNA website <br/>
will last forever.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, Jay<br/>

&gt; From what I have heard, there is a game played in England, <br/>
&gt; particularly in Dartmoor National Park, bearing a faint resemblance <br/>
&gt; to the hobby we call letterboxing.  It is called...  letterboxing!  <br/>
&gt; Seeing as how it has actually been around for over a hundred years, <br/>
&gt; technically it is "the original."<br/>
<br/>
<polite snippage=""><br/>
<br/>
I'm keeping my dog on a real short leash, because I don't want him in <br/>
this database race, but I do feel compelled to comment on the <br/>
specific issue you present here, SpringChick.<br/>
<br/>
I comprehend your concern about changes you see taking place in the <br/>
nature of letterboxing. To some extent, I sympathise with you, as <br/>
well. But, I also look at the realities of the transition of this <br/>
pastime from England to the U.S., and I cannot wonder -- or even be <br/>
particularly surprised -- at the changes that have occured.<br/>
<br/>
The game, as you point out, originated in the Dartmoor National Park, <br/>
in the U.K. This park has 368 square miles of letterbox hiding places <br/>
and a participant group that developed slowly and mostly by word-of-<br/>
mouth and person-to-person teaching. That park is almost exactly the <br/>
same size as Middlesex County, CT (where, as we all know, one has <br/>
only to walk out one's door to trip over a letterbox, no clue <br/>
required) which has 369 square miles. The entire state of Connecticut <br/>
has almost 4,000 square miles, and the United States, the ground on <br/>
which *we* play this game, has over 3.7 *million* square miles.<br/>
<br/>
The "rules" which you justly lament are workable for a contained area <br/>
with a knowledgeable player population, but they do not translate <br/>
well to a country ten *thousand* times that size. It would be nice if <br/>
they did, but they don't. They can't. And, added to that, the player <br/>
population in the U.S. is created by word-of-mouth, yes, but also by <br/>
media outlets and by the internet. The sheer numbers of participants <br/>
is staggering! (As is, speaking for many of us newbies, our ignorance <br/>
of the etiquette.) And, there's no way that those players can ever <br/>
come even close to knowing their "field of play" the way U.K. players <br/>
can know Dartmoor--as if it were the back of their own hand.<br/>
