"S " is for susan who perished in fits<br/>
Desmond gets thrown out of a sleigh<br/>

For those who think we are nutz ready the delightful Gashlycrumb <br/>
Tinies or go Whole Hog and get the Amphigorey, 15 collected works by <br/>
Edward Gorey.<br/>
<br/>
For those not knowing his work he illustrated the opening credits <br/>
for "Mystery" on PBS&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Delightful artwork and always just the best selection of words, thus <br/>
Basil get assaulted by the bears,not simply devoured.<br/>

  Correction--they are the top 2% of the population intelligence-wise who take <br/>

  There are a lot of smart people out there who don't need the piece of paper <br/>
  telling everyone they passed an IQ test. (BTW: this comes from a person who <br/>
  used to feel she needed that piece of paper) After attending a couple of MENSA <br/>

  that you won't find many MENSANs out there letterboxing. They tend to sit behind <br/>

  There are a lot of smart people out there who don't need the piece of paper <br/>
  telling everyone they passed an IQ test. (BTW: this comes from a person who <br/>
  used to feel she needed that piece of paper) After attending a couple of MENSA <br/>
  functions, I learned, (this is my experience and I'm generalizing, of course) <br/>
  that you won't find many MENSANs out there letterboxing. They tend to sit behind <br/>
  computers and shun all exercise and sunlight.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, it's not the top 2% who test, it's the top 2% as judged by international averages determined by statistical sampling. Think about that very carefully from a statistical point of view and you will see the error in your statement, unless of course it was an error in your choice of phrasing used.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want this to turn into a heated debate. Really. I'm proud of knowing that I'm brilliant. I don't wave around my membership card, I don't go to the functions, I occasionally read the Bulletin and the Boston LocSec newsletter. However, I chose to test out of curiousity and maintain my membership as a personal choice. Besides, it looks great on a resume, and in this day and age of a fallen job market, every little bit helps (on top of two Bachelor of Science degrees completed this past May at the end of my senior year and excellent scores on SAT and GRE exams).<br/>
<br/>
I'll leave it at that. However, your statement: "you won't find many MENSANs out there letterboxing. They tend to sit behind computers and shun all exercise and sunlight" is seriously flawed. Perhaps you didn't notice the SIG's that are devoted to outdoorsy endeavors.<br/>
<br/>
Despite your cautionary statement, offense was taken. If you didn't intend to make a statement that attempts to defame someone or some group, you wouldn't have painted with such broad strokes. Either way, it's ridiculous to make gross generalizations about any particular group, so let's refrain from doing so, shall we?<br/>

See, therein is one of the problems that mailing lists have in general....  Because of the inherit lack of proper communications (And by proper, I mean communications between human beings that consists of verbal, tonal and body.) some one makes a comment or a statement and someone else takes offense at it.<br/>
<br/>
I've only one question..... Are you the one that sites behind the computer and shuns sunlight or not?  From my personal experience, the ones that scream the loudest are the ones that feel the guiltiest... Not that I'm saying you are guilty by any means, just painting a generality with broad strokes here. I really don't care if you are 'Cletus, The slack-jawed yokel' or Einstein himself. Brilliancy is subjective, much as beauty is and I know people that think I'm the most brilliant man they have ever met and some that think I'm dumber that a box of rocks and not the sharpest tool in the shed.  Opinions.  Opinions are like a$$holes, everyone's got one and they usually stink. (BTW, that's not intended to offend, but I'm sure it will.)<br/>
