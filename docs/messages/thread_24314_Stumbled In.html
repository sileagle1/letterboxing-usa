<br/>
I stumbled upon one of, someone's, letterboxes this afternoon while  <br/>
hiking in Glen Helen Park in Yellow springs, Ohio. At first I didn't  <br/>
know what it was. Thought maybe someone left it there by accident. It  <br/>
was pretty much hidden from view; but, since I'm a curious person I  <br/>
always look in the nooks and crannies for hidden treasure. I'm now a  <br/>
little richer for it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I jotted down a line or two and drew a picture since I have  <br/>
yet to carve a stamp. Kind of figures since this is my first  <br/>
encounter with such a thing. Anyway, to bring out the youth in me,  <br/>
it's in there somewhere, I'll carve something soon and keep an eye  <br/>
out for those special finds.<br/>
<br/>
take care<br/>

your enthusiasm to be squashed by having the same experience we did.<br/>
(Fortunately, we were already hooked on letterboxing b/c we'd had lots of<br/>
success finding boxes here in MA.) We ONLY looked for boxes in Yellow<br/>
Springs, not any of the surrounding communities. Hopefully someone who has<br/>
been boxing in Greene County in the last couple of years can give you some<br/>
guidance about active boxes. Yellow Springs, for sure, can use some more<br/>
letterboxers, so dive right in and enjoy this treasure-hunting passion.<br/>
Maybe you'll plant some boxes some day, and we'll be printing the clues as<br/>
soon as we hit town! :-)<br/>

Thank you for following up on your find, and sharing with all of us the<br/>
pleasure you experienced stumbling upon a letterbox "treasure."<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
New to this group (and sort-of new to letterboxing), just thought <br/>
I'd "speak" up and say hello...<br/>
<br/>
"Stumbled In" is exactly how we got started letterboxing. I was out <br/>
with my kids a year or so ago, when my son noticed a couple removing <br/>
a box from it's hiding spot. Needless to say we were curious and hung <br/>
around to see what was up. The couple obviously didn't notice us and <br/>
went about their business of stamping a little notebook and then <br/>
after watching the area for a few minutes (how they didn't see us <br/>
watching them, I'll never know) they carefully re-hid the box.<br/>
<br/>
Do I have to say that the moment they were out of sight the kids and <br/>
I were over there lickety-split looking for "the box?" <br/>
<br/>
That was it. There was a little introductory note about letterboxing <br/>
and a link to a website and the rest is history. We only did a couple <br/>
last year, but a few weeks ago we were back at the same place where <br/>
we first found the box and my son mentioned the incident from the <br/>
year before. So after a couple hours on line and a few printed clues <br/>
for boxes in our area, I had the kids make up log books and pick out <br/>
stamps. We were off and running the next morning. <br/>
<br/>
Our first box? The first one we "stumbled upon" of course (I found <br/>
the actual clues for it first, to make it official). It's been a <br/>
month now and we have done one "clue" a weekend, sometimes two if <br/>
they are in the same area. We love to hike and do things outdoors so <br/>
this is perfect for our family. I've noticed a few boxes hidden in <br/>
librarys as well and will save those for the rainy days.<br/>
<br/>
My husband thinks we're nuts, but he's the first to ask where the <br/>
book of clues is when we head out! Now my son wants to put a box <br/>
together to hide... <br/>
<br/>
So that's how we got started. We stumbled into the hobby, guess we're <br/>
not the only ones!<br/>

&gt; Hi folks,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I stumbled upon one of, someone's, letterboxes this afternoon <br/>
while  <br/>
&gt; hiking in Glen Helen Park in Yellow springs, Ohio. At first I <br/>
didn't  <br/>
&gt; know what it was. Thought maybe someone left it there by accident. <br/>
It  <br/>
&gt; was pretty much hidden from view; but, since I'm a curious person <br/>
I  <br/>
&gt; always look in the nooks and crannies for hidden treasure. I'm now <br/>
a  <br/>
&gt; little richer for it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I jotted down a line or two and drew a picture since I <br/>
have  <br/>
&gt; yet to carve a stamp. Kind of figures since this is my first  <br/>
&gt; encounter with such a thing. Anyway, to bring out the youth in <br/>
me,  <br/>
&gt; it's in there somewhere, I'll carve something soon and keep an <br/>
eye  <br/>
&gt; out for those special finds.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; take care<br/>

I think you and the others are right about Letterboxing being addictive. Everyting from <br/>
carving a stamp to trying to figure out the clues, ~zess~ has a really nice one in <br/>
"Perpetuity," a Letterbox in Glen Helen. In the process I even learned a little more about <br/>
the Glen. Which is surprizing since, for the most part, I grew up adventuring through that <br/>
neck of the woods. I didn't find the box though, but will try again next time out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the kind welcomes everyone, much appreciated.<br/>
