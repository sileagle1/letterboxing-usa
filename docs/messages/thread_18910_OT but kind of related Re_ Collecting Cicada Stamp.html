Other years, we see a couple around, but for these 2 weeks of this yr., there are millions and won't be again for another 17. Some people 1/2 hour away haven't seen them yet. I'm not sure if they're on a different yr. or a different week.  In other words, in the next 20 sq. mile area they may be on a different schedule. But in our area we were all prepared by the news reports for exactly which week they would come out of the ground, and sure enough they stuck to the schedule.  Wooded areas around here are extremely thick with them-- noise and shells both.  There are other cicadas we hear every summer, the loudest in August. But these sound different.  --lunaryakketyact. <br/>

Partly true -- there are 23 different broods that are geographically <br/>
dispersed across the US, and each brood does emerge at 17 year intervals. <br/>
As a result, a particular region of the country might be home to a couple <br/>
of those broods, but they will only see cicadas every couple of years, and <br/>
definitely *not* every year.<br/>
