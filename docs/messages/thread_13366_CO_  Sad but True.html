Letterbox is indeed missing (along with the hitchhiker that was <br/>
inside it).  Franzsolo and I had chatted by email and I told him I'd <br/>
go check on this box reported MIA.  <br/>
<br/>
Yep - its a goner.  A shame, this was planted in a great, easy-to-get-<br/>
to urban wilderness wetlands area.  Clues were perfect.  I may <br/>
replant something along this trail or in the nearby area someday.  <br/>
The area is a bit wet (hence the term wetlands) so perhaps I'll have <br/>
to figure a way to put the box up a tree or somewhere less exposed to <br/>
water and/or state park dudes.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a way to contact MissyB to let her know that her box is <br/>
gone.  She only planted it this past November.   <br/>
<br/>
*pout* I hate missing boxes.<br/>

I'm pretty sure that Missy B knows it is MIA.<br/>
Thanks for confirming my worst fears !<br/>
