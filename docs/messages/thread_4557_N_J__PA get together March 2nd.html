This is what Floating Feather, Lockmaster and I plan on doing March 2nd.  We <br/>
will meet Pete and Wanda in Easton, PA. at the "Fish Passage way" at the old <br/>
Canal Museum off Rt.611 at 4pm to meet, greet and exchange stamps. If the <br/>
weather is awfull we will meet in the lobby of "The Best Western" just <br/>
around the corner from that location where they are staying in town at the <br/>
same time.<br/>
We hope that many other 'boxers will be willing to do the same. Looks like <br/>
Muk-Luk, Mary and Priscilla and the Borzoilady will be there too.<br/>
Afterwards our contingent of three will head downriver on Rt. 611 approx. 5 <br/>
miles to Raubsville and to the Raubsville Inn along the Delaware River. <br/>
There we will get a bite to eat and share letterboxing stories with all <br/>
comers!!!<br/>
Hope to see lots of folks there!<br/>
Could we start a list of people who are planning on coming to meet Pete and <br/>
Wanda at 4pm?<br/>
See you soon!<br/>
See Joy<br/>

Way at 4:00pm, and perhaps more. And, we're planning on going to the <br/>
Raubsville Tavern afterwards (I've already called the Tavern, and they said it <br/>
would be fine for us to drop in en masse on Saturday, but I'm going to <br/>
re-confirm with the owner on Wednesday, since she wasn't around on Monday, <br/>
and they're closed Tuesdays...).<br/>
<br/>
I've carved an event stamp, a picture of which I've posted on the PCLG website:<br/>

<br/>
See everyone at 4:00pm on Saturday! Pray for good weather...<br/>
