&gt; if you really want to match the colors I've used for many of the <br/>
&gt; other webpages, they are STEELBLUE and WHEAT.  I don't<br/>
&gt; remember what these translate to in hexidecimal ...<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what hexidecimal is, but I CAN translate it to <br/>
Crayola! That's Cornflower Blue... my fav! <g><br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Mitch... here's my dilemma (today's dilemma, anyway)...<br/>
I don't "do" html yet ... I am using AOLPress, which is one of those<br/>
programs that does the html stuff for you if you keep it rudimentary,<br/>
I guess. I CAN change the colors ~ there are a set number of standard<br/>
colors, and then you can choose custom colors by entering numbers<br/>
for color, hue, etc. Right now the background is set for:<br/>
Hue:27; Sat:154; Lum:185; Red:234; Green:209; Blue:159 ~ and<br/>
the "code" I get for these settings is: #ead19f <br/>
Since my previous settings were hard to read, I changed the color<br/>
of the text and raised the Luminosity(?)# of the background color a bit.<br/>
Hope that makes it better.<br/>
Tables? Well, I could prob'ly do that...<br/>
Copy the source file? If I select on a page and copy, I just get the<br/>
text... What that procedure if it's not too complicated?<br/>
Should I add a link that goes back to the main LbNA page?<br/>
If this is too much bother, I think it is ok as it is.... yes?<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Deborah<br/>
