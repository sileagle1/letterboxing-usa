For those of you on the East Coast, be sure to check out the Leonid <br/>
meteor shower on Tuesday, November 19.  The shower will be most <br/>
visible from 5-6 AM that morning.  For best viewing conditions, leave <br/>
the city lights behind and find an open area preferably at high <br/>
elevation.  I have never seen a meteor shower before and am very <br/>
excited!<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of a good open area near Thurmont (or further out) <br/>
that is public property?  If not, I may have to drive out there and <br/>
scope something out.<br/>

Savage Mill yesterday, but elected to go shopping instead. Now there <br/>
are more boxes in Savage! Hip Hip Hooray!!! I suppose when we go I'll <br/>
have to donate a box.<br/>
    We checked on our Lost Directions Mystery Box and were very <br/>
excited to see that some people had a little bit of trouble finding <br/>
it. I just figured it to be too easy. But then I wrote the story. <br/>
