weather was incredibly blustery and frigidly cold. I found Southeast <br/>
Light, Indian Cemetary (one of my all-time favorite stamps), White <br/>
Rock at Black Rock (took me a while to figure out the exact spot when <br/>
finally near the end) and the Treasure Chest Letterbox planted by the <br/>
Grifs. This box was a total mess, exposed on the beach and full of <br/>
water.  The "treasure" was intact and I had supplies with me to <br/>
repair the box. I hid as best I could.  Did you find it??<br/>
  My trip to B.I. was right at the beginning of my learning of the <br/>
hobby. Treasure Box was my tenth find. <br/>
