By the way, no audit will ever be done on your PFX scores.  If <br/>
someone thinks you are lying, they will likely not care much.  If you <br/>
think you are lying, you will not be able to sleep at night and it <br/>
will be punishment enough.<br/>
<br/>
P means put, placed, created, clued, and carved.  It is any box you <br/>
make with a new stamp, clues, and log book.  If you replace a box it <br/>
does not count as a new P unless the clue and the location and the <br/>
stamp are all changed.  If you start a hitchhiker along its way it <br/>
counts as P.  If you find the hitchhiker and move it along it is not <br/>
a P it is an ... <br/>
<br/>
F means found... which means found unless... well, it does not count <br/>
as found if you planted it, even if you forgot where it was, or one <br/>
you already have found, or one you can't remember finding, but whose <br/>
stamp you already have (unless two boxes have duplicate stamps!)  It <br/>
does not even count as found if you find it somewhere else... down <br/>
the river, or in the park ranger's office.  If you find a box and <br/>
repair it by replacing the stamp or pouring the water out of it or <br/>
drying it in the summer sun, or putting it in a new tupperware, it is <br/>
still found - not placed.  You will get extra credit when it counts - <br/>
uh, when it is important - it does *not* count except to God and to <br/>
the letterboxer you helped out.  <br/>
<br/>
X means exchange... and this usually works by finding the boxer <br/>
instead of the box.  Any letterboxer you find who has their stamp <br/>
available can stamp your log book if both parties agree.  (The <br/>
reverse is true as well.) <br/>
<br/>
Note that no one has ever decreed a punishment levied on an honestly <br/>
found letterboxer who does not have their stamp available.  If this <br/>
sport were more like life in fighter squadrons, someone would have <br/>
set such a penality long ago...  but it is not.  I live in fear that <br/>
I will be found without my squadron coin - especially near a bar - <br/>
where money runs out of one's pockets like water through seemingly <br/>
sealed tupperware. Perhaps, for the good of Boston pubs, such a <br/>
punishment could be decreed by the Lords and Ladies of LbNA.  At the <br/>
very least, this should be required at meetings of letterboxers.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally, I saw a posting several weeks back that listed P, F, X and <br/>
E.  I foolishly asked what E might stand for, foolish because no one <br/>
answered and here I sit asking again....<br/>
