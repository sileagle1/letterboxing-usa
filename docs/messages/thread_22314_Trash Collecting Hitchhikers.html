                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have finally  made two Trash Collecting Hitchhikers. What's that<br/>
you say? It's two 35mm film<br/>
canisters glued end to end and secured with packing tape. A log<br/>
book and small stamp fit in one end and a Wal-Mart sized shopping<br/>
bag goes into the other. It's a tight fit, but you really can<br/>
squeeze that thing in there.<br/>
<br/>
It works like this- You find it in a regular letterbox and treat it<br/>
like a regular Hitchhiker, making all the appropriate stampings.<br/>
Then you remove the bag and collect any trash you find along the way<br/>
back from the box. Dispose of the trash at your earliest<br/>
convenience and place a new bag into the Hitchhiker before placing<br/>
the whole thing in another Letterbox.<br/>

Not only are you prettying up the places we go to, but you get a (F)<br/>

I've made two so far and will be placing them soon. If you're going<br/>
to make a hithhiker anyway, I ask that you give this a try.<br/>

I have tried that, but no, it won't fit.  Once the bag is in there, <br/>
there's no room for anything else.  Maybe if a smaller bag is used, <br/>
you could stick one of those plastic 'hair dye' gloves in there with <br/>
it.  They're pretty thin.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree with Mumma, latex should not be used.<br/>
