Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
        I would just like to let you all know I cried and cried for hours before I <br/>
decided to post pone this gathering.  I put so much work into it.  I would do <br/>
anything to change the weather.  I didn't want to inconvience anyone, really, <br/>
I'm not a harble person.  I just didn't want people driving in the two feet of <br/>
snow we are going to get up here and get into an accident and me feel <br/>
horable for the rest of my life that i put someone in danger.  <br/>
      They have already closed the University for tomorrow and we havn't gotten <br/>
a single snow flake.  That says something because it has to be bad to shut <br/>
down the school.  My family down in Mass said they are getting two inches so <br/>
please see the big difference between two inches and 24.  There is no way <br/>
even if everyone fought the snow that the boxes would be accessible anyway.<br/>
        I really do hope that you all don't hate me forever but I thought this was <br/>
the best thing.  <br/>

You should know by now that letterboxers are like children - if you take our gathering away, we revolt. Just give us a time out!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for keeping our safety in mind, like a good parent, and I'm sure we'll enjoy it that much more in April! And we really do appreciate the time and effort you've  expended!<br/>

Merenwen, don't be so hard on yourself!!!  You did the right thing <br/>
by postponing the gathering - you folks up there in Maine are way <br/>
more experienced with winter weather and know when it has the upper <br/>
hand!  You considered everyone's safety and hopefully by the April <br/>
reschedule date, the weather will be much better. <br/>
Sojourner (here in southern CT we got about 1 inch today)<br/>
Good luck with your snow storm!! :-(  (...think spring, think <br/>
spring...)<br/>

Your post clearly shows what a caring and unselfish person you are to put the safety and wellbeing of others above your own hard work and satisfaction.  It must have been a difficult decision to make, and I'd like to think any of the rest of us here would have made the same choice.  Cheer up, spring is on it's way (or so they say), which leaves many a warm and sunny weekends for an Art Guru Gathering.  RSVP-ing in advance, MayEve<br/>
