after the short back story:<br/>
<br/>
Nearly two years ago, just before Memorial Day 2004, I was doing <br/>
some online reseach into the history of the Quabbin Reservoir in <br/>
central Massachusetts.  The Quabbin's history has always fascinated <br/>
me because in order to build the 412 billion gallon reservoir, four <br/>
towns had to be levelled -- homes and businesses dismantled, <br/>
families moved, graves relocated, trees and landscape clear-cut.<br/>
<br/>
While looking around on this interesting subject, I happened across <br/>
a page titled "QUABBIN RESERVOIR LETTERBOX", which turned out to be <br/>
the Dana Common letterbox placed by Bill &amp; Craig.  Curious, I read <br/>
through the page, and clicked through to their homepage.  As I <br/>
became more and more intrigued by this "letterboxing" thing I <br/>
eventually found my way to LbNA and to this talk group.  As the <br/>
adage says, "the rest is history".  Here I am, two years and nearly <br/>
800 finds later!<br/>
<br/>
I've accomplished a thing or two in the short time I've been <br/>
letterboxing, and have watched this hobby evolve at a pace I would <br/>
have never expected.  Yet one thing I had not accomplished was <br/>
adding the box that brought me to this hobby to my F count -- the <br/>
Dana Common letterbox.  That is, until yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
My non-letterboxing girlfriend in tow, I worked my way up from <br/>
Grafton, stopping to pick up Bill &amp; Craig's Mass Central Rail Trail <br/>
West and LoneMassWolf's Fisher King letterboxes before walking the <br/>
two mile road from Gate 40 to the old Dana Common in pursuit of the <br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
The road and the common both were interesting and one could not <br/>
escape the sense of history in that place.  Of course, more than <br/>
anything finally notching this find was my day's highlight!<br/>
<br/>
I forgot to bring the clues to a certain mystery series I know is in <br/>
the area, though, and also missed another box along the way, so I'll <br/>
be back -- but the feather in my cap is now placed!<br/>
