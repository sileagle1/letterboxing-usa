the use of styrofoam. There were a lot of issues I hadn't thought of. I am<br/>
abandoning the strofoam idea and will be looking into the websites<br/>
suggested. Or maybe I'll abandon the idea all together and lug real rocks<br/>
around the woods :-) Look for a person with a VERY heavy looking lumpy<br/>
backpack. Lol<br/>

&gt; There are a number of fake rocks around the building where I work,<br/>
&gt; concealing rat traps. If you want to buy plastic fake rocks, here are<br/>
&gt; some places:<br/>

&gt; I would definitely not use styrofoam for anything out-doors. Its<br/>
&gt; trashy stuff, and there's far too much of it out there in the woods<br/>
&gt; and streams already.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It probably would be a lot easier just to gather a few real rocks and<br/>
&gt; stack them up to hide the letterbox. But if you're willing to take the<br/>
&gt; time to put it together, there's something very clever about a<br/>
&gt; realistic fake rock that could make for a fun letterbox!<br/>
