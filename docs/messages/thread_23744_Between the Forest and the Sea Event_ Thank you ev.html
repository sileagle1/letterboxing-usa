time event for us/with us.<br/>
Thank you Kurious Jo and Wood Aug. Your carving demonstrations and<br/>
patience with young and old made it a truly meaningful and productive.<br/>
Your carving abilites are incredible!!<br/>
Thanks for sharing your tools as well.<br/>
Thank You Team Garlic! <br/>
I think I am in mastercarve heaven...now I just have to find my<br/>
carving tools. Chocolate Bunny and Bitty Baby really got into doing<br/>
some carving and...well, not sure where they put them.<br/>
Mild Mannered Piper, you really do stay mild mannered. Afghan Penguin<br/>
and Lucky Charm, how are those arms feeling after that long paddle?<br/>
Red Dragon how are your ears? Hope all better...dragons and water in<br/>
the ear is not a good combination.<br/>
Team Freaky Stink with Bitty Baby, Yellow Puffle and Crazy Frog! wow!<br/>
So glad you could make it and be introduced to carving. (the two<br/>
junior members of this team have yet to claim names. Superb!!carving<br/>
especially with the lettering!! You should see these guys! They also<br/>
got to find their first box ever!!<br/>
Now as for BC's own CSB and Zara, thanks so much for coming out. It<br/>
all would not have happened without you, I was ready to give up on<br/>
boxing a year ago. Hope to see you again real soon.<br/>
Cliomouse we really missed you, but your spot is reserved here any<br/>
time you would like!!!<br/>
As for the rest of you. Hope you can come boxing, kayaking and hiking<br/>
'up' here one day, and for the Vancouver boxers not yet into<br/>
onnecting. We hope to see you on the trails and see your boxes too.<br/>
The weather could not have been better!<br/>
