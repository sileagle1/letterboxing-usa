                    <div class="plaintext-content">As long as I'm giving updates on Tyranena and Fort Atkinson, I thought I'd<br/>
finally take the time to announce my findings (or lack thereof) of some of<br/>
the other WI letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Tyranena - I forgot to mention that it is at the city park in Lake Mills.<br/>
It is NOT a State park.<br/>
<br/>
E-Way Trails Box - fine as of 12/14/02<br/>
<br/>
Cam-Rock Canoe Launch - fine as of 12/14/02<br/>
<br/>
River Watch (Ft. Atkinson) - missing as of 12/14/02 (at least I couldn't<br/>
find it)<br/>
<br/>
Eagle LB - fine as of 12/14/0. Picked up Robot 1 HH.<br/>
<br/>
Boyhood Adventures LB - were fine back in 8/6/02.  Went to find Mt.<br/>
Bieterman LB with some students after a math meet on 11/25/02 but it was<br/>
missing.  Noticed that BirkieBob was in the area at the time and figured he<br/>
was checking on it.  I have not gone back to check if it is there again.<br/>
(Note to BirkieBob: I live very close to all three of your boxes in WI.  I'd<br/>
be happy to keep an eye on them for you if you wish.)<br/>
<br/>
Boerner Botanical Gardens LB - fine as of 12/15/02 - I was the first!<br/>
<br/>
Wehr Nature Center - fine as of 11/23/02<br/>
<br/>
University of Green Bay LBs-<br/>
<br/>
Cofrin Arboretum #1 - went looking for it three times and was not found.<br/>
Last looked in 12/27/02.  Tried both old and new clues all three times.<br/>
<br/>
Cofrin Arboretum #2 - also searched three times without any luck.  I believe<br/>
it is also missing.  I assume the "another observation spot" is the tower in<br/>
the middle of the Corn Maze.  Is this right?<br/>
<br/>
Bay Shoreline - still missing as of 11/8/02.  Good hiding spot - shame it's<br/>
gone.<br/>
<br/>
Under the Overpass - still there as of 11/8/02.  Had been cleaned up by<br/>
previous person, but I found it completely soaked again.  It is in poor<br/>
condition.  You might move it to a higher location.<br/>
<br/>
Shorewood Golf Course - still missing as of 11/8/02<br/>
<br/>
High Cliff series - found all 3 on 11/9/02. All in good condition.<br/>
<br/>
Algoma Pierhead Lighthouse LB - I could not find it on 12/26/02.  I think it<br/>
is missing.  I searched the rocks for an hour.<br/>
<br/>
La Salle Park - I could not find it either on 12/26/02.  The clue is very<br/>
vague.  Still, I think it is lost.<br/>
<br/>
Sturgeon Bay Shipping Canal LB East - I searched the rocks for an hour and<br/>
could not find it on 12/26/02.  Clue to the bonus stamp would be lost then<br/>
also. :(<br/>
<br/>
Sturgeon Bay Shipping Canal LB West -found in good condition on 12/26/02<br/>
<br/>
Chanticleer Guest House LB - couldn't find a place to park except the<br/>
Chanticleer itself.  Are we allowed to park there?<br/>
<br/>
Cave Point LB - found in good condition on 12/26/02.  I thought it was<br/>
interesting that I had found the box one day before the ranger at the park<br/>
complained about the box being there.  I'm sure they did not see me there.<br/>
<br/>
Old Bailey's Harbor Lighthouse LB - still missing 12/26/02.  The light house<br/>
is even gone now too!<br/>
<br/>
Bailey's Harbor Range Lights LB - still missing 12/26/02.  Has NOT been<br/>
replaced.<br/>
<br/>
Cana Island LB - found in good condition on 12/26/02.<br/>
<br/>
Mink River LB - found in good condition on 12/27/02.  Placed Robot 1 HH<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
Sherwood Point Lighthouse LB - still missing on 12/27/02.<br/>
<br/>
Cabot Point LB - I could not find it in the rocks.  I looked for over an<br/>
hour on 12/27/02.  I assume the end of Cabot point is the last place the<br/>
public is allow to drive to on the road.  There is a private drive that goes<br/>
out further.<br/>
<br/>
Holy Hill LB - found in good condition on 8/7/02<br/>
<br/>
Green One/Caltrava - found in good condition on 8/8-14/02<br/>
<br/>
