Yay!  I'm glad you found the Bananconda and the Avocadodo!  I haven't been <br/>
able to get out there and hope to do so this weekend as I had heard that they <br/>
were building disc golf near the Mangorilla - you were unable to find it?  <br/>
Unfortunately you probably were in the right place and I hope no one else has found <br/>
it and removed or destroyed it.  Hopefully it's still there as I carved its <br/>
companion stamp and want to place them together this weekend.<br/>
I have two more boxes to place in this series and then they shall be done....<br/>
