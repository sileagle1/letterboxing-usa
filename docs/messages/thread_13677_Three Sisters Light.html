Hello ,<br/>
<br/>
Many have reported this box missing and we searched for it ourselves ,<br/>
but that was with snow cover . The sight is very close to another box <br/>
( Nauset Light ) so the trip will be productive . Also its a very <br/>
interesting spot so I would say go for it . Many a box has gone <br/>
missing only to turn up for a diligent seeker .<br/>

out to box on Cape Cod, there were two sets of clues for the same box on the <br/>
website.  They looked identical to me (no I didn't read them both word for <br/>
word), so I brought one set and we were off.... well.... it was the WRONG SET!  <br/>
I'm sure Darrin's still cursing me for that one!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.... go to the old site and bring all sets of clues with you!  (This <br/>
has nothing to do with the Nauset Light clues mind you.....)<br/>

That tripped us up too...but we realized it in the parking lot and <br/>
had the other set of clues.<br/>
<br/>
This box was there last summer definately...Watch out for poison ivy, <br/>
its probably going to be a banner year for it on the cape<br/>
