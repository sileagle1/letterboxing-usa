and I went biking and hiking the after his record breaking campaign appearance in <br/>
Portland, OR last week. He is in full agreement that the virgin timber should remain <br/>
protected since these are the trees most likely to have good hidey holes in them for <br/>
letterboxes. <br/>
<br/>
I'm heading out this afternoon to be see if I can recover Rosie Ruiz HH from the spot <br/>
Kerry left her. This is a most perplexing clue but if anyone can nail a box named Boss <br/>
Hogg, it's gotta be the Funhog. Gotta keep those hitch hikers movin'. Funhog<br/>
