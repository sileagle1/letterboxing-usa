Atlas Quest has already come up and Yes, you can view the clues with <br/>
the cache button.<br/>

I, and others like me, have also filed our clues on the various <br/>
regional group sites, like LbGLK (great lakes).  That would be another <br/>
good place to start.<br/>

maybe do a search for "letterboxing" or "letterboxes" on some of the major<br/>
