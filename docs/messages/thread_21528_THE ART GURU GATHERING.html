Hello Everyone,<br/>
I have started getting the e-mail I thought I would be getting when I saw the <br/>
four days of snow ahead.  I would not want any one to be crazy and drive up <br/>
here for a gathering in such bad conditions, so with much thought I am <br/>
changeing the date of the gathering to April 3rd.  I am sorry to anyone who <br/>
has made reservations already but i am doing this for everyones safety.  April <br/>
3rd I am hoping will bring good weather and an extra hour of day light.  <br/>
Please e-mail me with any questions and I hope all of you will still be able to <br/>
make it up then.<br/>
<br/>
Merenwen and Olwe<br/>

Portland has had 99.3inches of snow this winter.<br/>
That doesn't even come close to Central Penobscot (aka Bangor - where<br/>
we live) nor far northern maine (aka Fort Kent and Machias) believe<br/>
me, we're not wimps. Just really tired of trying to get around in<br/>
almost 100 inches of snow.<br/>
<br/>
See you in April!<br/>

Well,<br/>
I can't begin to tell you how happy I am that my wife<br/>
and I took the day out of work, booked a hotel and<br/>
cancelled plans with my family. (who as a result<br/>
cancelled their plans.)  Snow has been in the forecast<br/>
for Maine since last week. I know I'm not from Maine,<br/>
but I do read the NEWSPAPER now and then and<br/>
sometimes, when I'm feeling naughty, I watch the<br/>
WEATHER CHANNEL.  They have that stuff in Maine,<br/>
right? Aren't New Englanders used to driving in the<br/>
snow...What is the deal? <br/>
<br/>
All about the hike!! <br/>
