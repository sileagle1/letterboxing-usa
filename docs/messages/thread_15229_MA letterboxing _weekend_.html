and letterboxing.  The weather was great and we found all the boxes <br/>
we hunted for and even planted 6!  Clues will be posted in the next <br/>
couple of days.<br/>
<br/>
We stopped first in Greenfield on 8/17 and found all 4 Poet's Seat <br/>
Tower Boxes, even the last one! Beautiful view up there!<br/>
<br/>
On Monday we went first to plant 2 boxes in one of my favorite spots <br/>
and then on to Mt. Greylock to find the 2 boxes there.  We did find <br/>
them both and had quite the hike!  After leaving the mountain we <br/>
headed out to the Natural Bridge Junior Rangers Box, we found that <br/>
one but when we went to get the clues for the other 11 boxes they've <br/>
hidden no one was there!  I guess we'll have to go back!<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday morning we hid 4 more boxes at Mohawk State Forest which is <br/>
where we were camping (another favorite place of ours).  <br/>
Unfortunately we then had to head home and back to work!<br/>
<br/>
We were going to look for the boxes at Wendell SP but were unsure of <br/>
exactly how to get there.  I didn't even think to bring a map!!  We <br/>
missed the gathering by just one day, unfortunatley when we heard <br/>
about it, it was too late to change our plans so we could attend.  <br/>
Could someone let me know the best route there from RT 2.  We would <br/>
like to do these boxes next time.<br/>
<br/>
Now to go start posting clues to our new boxes!<br/>

Hi Momma Fox<br/>
These are the directions that the Mass. State Parks have posted to <br/>
their website.  I believe it is the way Bob and I got to the <br/>
gathering.  Once in Millers Falls the signs to Wendell State Forest <br/>
are fairly clear.<br/>
Park Directions:<br/>
Wendell State Forest is located in the northeast part of central <br/>
Massachusetts.<br/>
