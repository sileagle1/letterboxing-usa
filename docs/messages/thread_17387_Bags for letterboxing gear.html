                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those asking about bags to help organize their letterboxing <br/>
supplies while on their treks, I've found that a ruggedized Camelbak <br/>
hydration system backpack with a few extra pockets on it works <br/>
rather nicely since it precludes having to carry an additional bulky <br/>
water bottle. (That is, for those times when I'm not serving as my <br/>
DS's--newly 2--personal Sherpa--that's when we're using the Kelty <br/>
Pack Kidcarrier/Ox/Football-linebacker tote).   <br/>
<br/>
As a sidenote, I recommend actually keeping your logbook itself in a <br/>
waterproof bag.  Of course, residing in the Northwest this should <br/>
have been a no brainer but we learned this lesson the hard way--<br/>
while visiting the East Coast last Fall as the remnants of a <br/>
Tropical Storm were passing through (for 10 STRAIGHT DAYS!!!-the <br/>
exact duration of our trip).  We've never seen rain like that--even <br/>
in the Seattle area!!!<br/>
<br/>
After graduating from the trusty zippered plastic bag, we eventually <br/>
converted to the waterproof Eagle Creek bags which you can find here:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.rei.com/online/store/CategoryDisplay?<br/>
catalogId=40000008000&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=8000&amp;categoryId=4501739<br/>
<br/>
We prefer Item # 641975 that runs about $8 because it's just large <br/>
enough for a nice leather journal, stamp pad, pen, sharpie marker <br/>
and an altoid tin containing our signature stamps.  I carry my <br/>
colored markers (the dual-tipped paintbrush type) separately in a <br/>
nice mesh pencil bag we purchased at Wally World (Wal-Mart) for $1 <br/>
in the kids school stuff section just before the start of the school <br/>
year--the pens fit perfectly in the bag (I think we carry about 15 <br/>
pens of various colors on our hikes).  I've also started carrying a <br/>
little 'clip-style' rectangular container (about 2-1/2"x3"x1") that <br/>
houses our 'cat eyes' stamp pads in various colors, too--I found <br/>
this container at an Asian food/grocery store for about $2.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So--this system has served rather nicely to help us carry our <br/>
letterboxing gear, water, snacks, cell phone, pocket knife, <br/>
applicable maps, mini-tote umbrella (for stamping in during non-<br/>
windy rainstorms), bird/nature id books, whistle, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year!  See you on the trails...<br/>

I finally found the perfect bag for our letterboxing jaunts.  DH bought it for me for our anniversary 2 years ago...I'm not a wine and roses kinda gal...  ya' know whutimeen?<br/>
<br/>
It's made by Mountainsmith and can be purchased in many outdoor stores.  It has convertible handle sold seperately called strapetts that convert it into a back pack.  It has lumbar straps and lots of other pockets and doodads!  The lumbar straps can be tucked away in their own special pocket and can be carried like a satchel.<br/>

<br/>
Mine is all black with yellow bungees and pull tabs.  MY favorite feature is the bungee cord across the front.  It's perfect for a tightly rolled "Neat Sheet"!<br/>
<br/>
They come in a variety of sizes, mine is the "Tour"<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We too use a medium sized CamelBack and it works well. During a hot <br/>
day in Hartman last summer we managed to pack out logbook, stamps, <br/>
ink, 3 extra bottles of water, compass, repari materials, and all <br/>
that jazz into it along with filling the bladder of the CamelBack. <br/>
Really a very nice set up.  They even sell drying racks for <br/>
camelbacks so you can let it airdry and not get that gunk that <br/>
occasionally will build up.<br/>
<br/>
We were actually looking to go with a pack thats more a hip pack and <br/>
not a backpack, but our logbook is quite large and would not fit.  <br/>
May still pick one up and just use blank note cards for those days; <br/>
it would be a nice option on some of the more rugged terrain! <br/>

admittedly get a bit heavy when fully loaded but improves as we drink the water. <br/>
