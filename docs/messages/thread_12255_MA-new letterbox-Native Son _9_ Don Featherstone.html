Don Featherstone is the original designer and creator of the Plastic Pink Flamingo, which is the only bird native exclusively to Leominster, and we are darned proud of it!<br/>
<br/>
Native Son #9 rests comfortably in The National Plastics Center and Museum which is located on 210 Lancaster Street (Route 117), you can pick up Rte. 117 in downtown Leominster and follow it for about a mile (more or less). The Plastics Center and Museum is on the left directly after St. Anna's Church. Hours are Weds-Sat. 11am to 4pm except for July and August when the Center is closed on Saturday. You do not have to pay admission to find the letterbox because it is located in the lobby however if you wish to view the exhibits the admission rate is $5.00 for adults and $3.00 for children. There are many hands-on and interactive exhibits for children. <br/>
<br/>
When you enter the lobby look for the Plastic Pink Flamingo majestically perched in the green plant. Your prize is behind the pot. Say hello to Deb Renzi at the admission desk, the box was planted with her enthusiastic permission. <br/>
