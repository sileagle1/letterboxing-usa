Hi ~TCM~<br/>
<br/>
You should make sure that there isn't a current listing for the box <br/>
either at AQ or LbNA. Since the box was found May 2006 there could <br/>
be a listing for the box somewhere other than the basement. You <br/>
might check the "Old" LbNA listing as well. Once you determine that <br/>
there isn't any listings then go back to the basement and post a <br/>
note regarding your adoption and contact Jay Drew. I think it was <br/>
Jay that originally set up the Basement so he should be able to help <br/>
you. It is great to see those oldies and moldies adopted.<br/>

atlasquest for the box and didn't find them listed.  I even went onto  the <br/>
geo-caching.com web page and checked there and found no listing.  I  didn't think <br/>
about the old letterboxing web site so I will check that.   That was a great <br/>
suggestion.  If I don't locate it there I'll contact Jay  and breath some new life <br/>
into this old box.  Which by the way just  celebrated it's 4th year <br/>
anniversary.  The original placement date was  September 22, 2002. ~The Cats Meow~  <br/>

I would still go ahead with contacting Jay. Most of those that are <br/>
listed in the basement a apart of the old LbNa web site, so it <br/>
probably needs adoption.<br/>

Maybe you could help me. I am relatively new to boxing, a couple months <br/>
now, and I have heard of AQ and LbNA, but I was wondering where to find <br/>
the "Old" LnNA listings. Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
