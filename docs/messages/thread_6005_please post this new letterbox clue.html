Placed: June 27, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Burton, Ohio<br/>
Geauga County<br/>
Nearest Big City: Cleveland<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Easy to Moderate ( hour hike one way)<br/>
<br/>
Burton Square is located east of Cleveland on Route 87 between the towns of <br/>
Middlefield and Newbury.  Park on the east side of the square near the Log <br/>
Cabin.<br/>
<br/>
When facing the front of the Log Cabin, take the sidewalk south past the <br/>
first crosswalk and continue on to the crosswalk at the southernmost edge of <br/>
the Square.  Cross over to the ice cream shop side of the street.  You will <br/>
pass the Red Maple Inn on the opposite side of the street.  Continue south on <br/>
the sidewalk, crossing over Carlton Street.  Pass by a black arrow pointing <br/>
to the left.  Where the sidewalk ends, veer off to the right, crossing over <br/>
part of a driveway and head down the path.  Pass by a red barn on the left <br/>
and a dead tree trunk in the shape of a "Y".  Further down the path, you will <br/>
see a yellow tank next to a fire hydrant.  Take the road behind the tank into <br/>
the woods.<br/>
<br/>
In the woods, pass by a stand of large black walnut trees, and a path on the <br/>
right.  Walk on to the graveyard.  Look for the gravestone that looks like a <br/>
lighthouse with the words "Mother" and "Baker" on it.  Walk at 330 - 335 <br/>
degrees to another path.  Take the path to a clearing, then take the path at <br/>
11:00.  Continue on that path to another clearing.  Take approximately 18 <br/>
paces and turn left onto a trail.  You will pass over a small creek and past <br/>
an uprooted tree on the left.  Go under a fallen tree and over a culvert <br/>
pipe.  Find a sewer drainage cover on the left.  Take approximately 8 paces <br/>
and turn right onto a path.  Go through a dip in the path (which may or may <br/>
not have water running through it) and on to the first fallen tree over the <br/>
path.  Step over the tree, face 250 degrees and take approximately 9 paces to <br/>
a very tall tree.  Face directly south and take 5 paces to an uprooted tree.  <br/>
Look inside the base of the tree for the letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
Caution: Trail is slippery and muddy after rain!<br/>
Pace: Every time either the left or right foot hits the ground (2 steps).<br/>
GOOD LUCK!<br/>
