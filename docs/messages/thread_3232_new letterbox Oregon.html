                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funhog placed Crooked River Ranch Letterbox #3 on Sept. 2 in Jefferson<br/>
County, Terrebonne, Oregon. This is not a hike for small children or<br/>
people unsure of their footing. The first 75 yards of the trail are<br/>
down a cliff with loose dirt and rocks. The rest is no problem. Be sure<br/>
to take water as the return trip can be a scorcher. And don't forget<br/>
about rattlesnakes! It takes about 45 minutes to the letterbox and a bit<br/>
longer coming back up out of the canyon.<br/>
To the trailhead:<br/>
Just north of Terrebonne on Hwy 97, turn west on Lower Bridge Rd. There<br/>
is a highway sign for Crooked River Ranch at this intersection. Follow<br/>
the signs on to the Ranch. Once you have made a 90 degree left turn you<br/>
will be on Chinook Ave. From this point follow the signs to the Golf<br/>
Course. Park here and look for the Ranch Chapel. Just to the left of<br/>
this building is a gravel path to the public basketball court. From the<br/>
far right corner of the court, take the path at 100 degrees (magnetic)<br/>
to the canyon rim.<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
At this point take the dirt trail at 140 degrees down to an old road bed<br/>
called Hollywood Road. This was built by a film crew in the 50s who<br/>
were making a B grade western starring Kirk Douglas. Picture a Conestoga<br/>
wagon being lowered with ropes and a human dummy being thrown over the<br/>
rim of the canyon, both parts of this work of art. Go left on this road<br/>
down into the Crooked River Canyon. You will pass an old dilapidated<br/>
water gate. The first spring you come to will be in a clump of trees<br/>
coming out of a pipe at ground level to the right of the trail. This is<br/>
good drinking water. The trail becomes faint at times beyond this point<br/>
and you will have to bushwack through three willow thickets. Keep going<br/>
to the next spring that looks like a 30 foot tall wedding cake frosted<br/>
with moss and dripping with cool water. At his point you will need to<br/>
backtrack on the trail to a row of four smooth barked trees on the<br/>
right. Look for I love Kenny scratched into the bark. Walk 35 paces to<br/>
a small juniper tree shaped like a candelabra. You should be standing on<br/>
a small pile of stones with a pile of orange rocks to your right and<br/>
white rocks to your left. Across the river at 333 degrees you will see<br/>
an old wooden ladder going up the cliff face. In front of the juniper is<br/>
a clump of sagebrush.  The letterbox is hidden under the rock nestled in<br/>
the sage, marked by a stick. Having found this box dont fail to go past<br/>
the wedding cake spring to the end of the trail. The wall is gushing<br/>
with dozens of springs and is an amazing sight. Happy Trails, Funhog<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On February 13, 2002 Funhog placed the Sandy Delta Letterbox in the <br/>
Columbia River Gorge. This box is near the town of Troutdale, in <br/>
Multnomah County, Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: From Portland take Hwy 84 east to exit 18 (Lewis and <br/>
Clark State Park.) At the stop sign turn right. Go under the <br/>
underpasses and park at the green metal gate straight ahead. Be careful <br/>
not to get back on the freeway! The letterbox is about a forty five <br/>
minute stroll from your car, one way.<br/>
<br/>
to the letterbox: A short distance after you pass through the green <br/>
metal gate, turn left at a narrow dirt road. Stay on this road past a <br/>
couple of seasonal ponds. Standing directly beneath three sets of three <br/>
you must make a choice. Three threes on your compass will send you on <br/>
your way. When the path comes to a T go left. At the next T turn right. <br/>
Stop at a bright yellow warning post. From this post go back the way <br/>
you came eighty steps. The letterbox is twenty two steps away at three <br/>
times thirty three. <br/>
