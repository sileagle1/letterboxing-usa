&gt; Sorry to hear about the Garden Gnome.  That was the first letterbox <br/>
&gt; we found!  I hope you get it back.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of thanks goes out to those who gave me hints about the status <br/>
of the Garden Gnome at various times.  As you may remember we found <br/>
him missing on Saturday.  Following information from local boxers <br/>
(thanks Jools and Mike) I followed my first hunch that he had been <br/>
washed out of his hiding place and began my search of the local <br/>
stream.<br/>
<br/>
Whadda ya know- rubbermaid really does float! ;o)  I found the box <br/>
making it's way through the streams of the park on it's way out to <br/>
the ocean.  Thankfully everthing inside was dry and in good condition <br/>
and I have my favorite little guy back, none the worse for wear.  <br/>
Just goes to prove that sometimes I actually can have good luck for a <br/>
change. <br/>
<br/>
I've given the gnome a new home and will post the revised clues under <br/>
another heading to make it easier for the webmasters but I have to <br/>
ask this...<br/>
<br/>
in ledger de maine style...<br/>
<br/>
does this count as a find???  He certainly *was* a far bit from home <br/>
and without the clues provided by Jools and Mike I may not have found <br/>
him floating away as he was...<br/>
<br/>
and can't I count this as another plant as well since he is not in <br/>
his original home??<br/>
<br/>
Huh?  Can I, huh?? Pleeeze!!! <vbg><br/>
