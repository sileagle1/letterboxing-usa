                    <div class="plaintext-content">Eccentric Leominster, Massachusetts millionairess Luvvy Huffington has reported the theft of her beloved pink flamingo, Percival. Although the flamingo was made out of plastic, Luvvy claims that it had all the charm and devotion of a live pet and she was never seen without it. In an attempt to recover the missing bird Ms. Huffington has put out a call to many of the world's most distinguished and prominent detectives.  "Percival was a gift from my late daddy, The Daddy Huffington, and the only thing that truly matters to me. I will spare no expense to ensure his safe and speedy recovery." The detectives are expected to gather in Leominster on Saturday, October 1st and work together to solve this crime. Any other interested parties are invited to join them. Luvvy requests that all gather at the National Plastic Center on 210 Lancaster Street between 9:30 and 10:00 to receive instructions as to how to go about contacting and aiding the detectives. Meanwhile Ms. Huffington is in seclusion and asks that all inquiries be directed to her secretary, Ms. Deanne Bellefeuille-Besnia at deebes@net1plus.com<br/>
