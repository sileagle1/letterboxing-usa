<br/>
Glacial Park<br/>
<br/>
Given enough time and about a million dump trucks, any New Jersey contractor <br/>
with connections could pile up enough rubble to recreate Long Island. That <br/>
the Wisconsin Ice Sheet took 10,000 years to do it shouldn't be discouraging. <br/>
This one mile hike explores a cache of rocky leftovers that didn't make it <br/>
out to Long Island, but somehow got dumped in a hollow in Connecticut during <br/>
the glacier's retreat. The hike is short, but amazingly rugged due to the <br/>
randomly dropped granite and schist erratics you'll be scrambling over. <br/>
Figure one hour of stoney enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From I95 in Groton, CT, take exit 86 and head north on CT Rte. 12 <br/>
for 6.7 miles. Turn right on Rte. 214 East, then after 1 mile, right again on <br/>
Avery Hill Extension. At the end of the road, turn left on Whalehead Rd and <br/>
watch to your left for the Glacial Park sign under power lines. Park in the <br/>
small parking area, and walk left onto the trail bearing 035, away from the <br/>
power line gate. Entering the woods, notice sporadic and faint old blue <br/>
blazes: although poorly maintained when this letterbox was placed, the blazes <br/>
will help quite a bit in keeping you on-trail over the course of the hike. <br/>
Soon fork left again at a loop intersection for a clockwise north-to-south <br/>
circle around this amazing area. In a short way, cross through a stone wall. <br/>
Turn right off-trail about 15 steps along the western side of the wall until <br/>
you come to a little drop off. The Boulder Train Letterbox lives here, in the <br/>
wall. Now continue with the trail uphill, watching for a sharp right that <br/>
will lead you across a zen garden of boulders in a big scattering of rubble. </div>
