Difficultly: Pretty easy<br/>
Distance:  mile or so<br/>

This is one of the Bolton Conservation series - we are slowly re-<br/>
working the clues so they can be found even if you don't live in <br/>
Bolton.<br/>
<br/>
Take the 117 exit off of 495 and head west. At the blicking light, <br/>
take a left onto a road that sounds like a "What a cool duck".<br/>
<br/>
Go quite a way on the road until you see a road on the right that <br/>
reminds you of most sports. Almost across the road from that <br/>
intersection will be the entrance to the Fyfeshire Conservation area <br/>
with a lovely stone arch welcoming you to the area.<br/>
<br/>
Have seat on the bench by the small pond, then follow the trail <br/>
around the pond into the woods. The larger pond will appear on your <br/>
right. When you see the dam, take the small path on the left to a <br/>
bridge that crosses the outlet and faces the dam stone wall (who said <br/>
that?). The letterbox is in a large cavity that DOES NOT require any <br/>
rocks to be moved. (Do not remove any rocks!)<br/>
<br/>
You can continue and find a small path on the right that leads down <br/>
to the water for a interesting view. Then continue on to the No <br/>
Trespassing sign if you want, and then return the way you came.<br/>
