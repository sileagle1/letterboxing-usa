                    <div class="plaintext-content">Alright everyone,<br/>
<br/>
The reservations have been made and the plans are in motion....<br/>
<br/>
Mark your calendars....<br/>
<br/>
Date:          Saturday 29 September 2002<br/>
Time:          8 am - 3 pm <br/>
Location:     Pocahontas State Park<br/>
<br/>
General Information: Just 20 miles from downtown Richmond, the <br/>
capital of Virginia, Pocahontas State Park has been one of the more <br/>
popular parks in the state park system. Swift Creek forms the nucleus <br/>
of the park, which is centered in a wildlife management area.<br/>
<br/>
First, I have a few questions/challenges for all those that wish to <br/>
participate in the shindig!<br/>
<br/>
a. Food: Pot Luck; we need to kind of spread out the menu amongst <br/>
each other. That way we don't all bring drinks and dessert. So please <br/>
start volunteering what you would like to bring. You can e-mail your <br/>
choice either to me (KBuquet@ApertureFoto.com) or Marsha <br/>
(mlgainey@yahoo.com)<br/>
<br/>
b. Submit a carved stamp to me (or the list) for judging by the list <br/>
to be THE representative stamp of the "1st Annual East Coast <br/>
Letterboxing Meet/Greet" Submit stamp (image) No Later Than 12:00 PM <br/>
FRIDAY 7 SEP 2002. Judging will be throughout the weekend of 8-9 Sep <br/>
02 (by members of the list of course). With the winning stamp <br/>
presented to the list on Monday 10 Sep 02. Once the winning stamp has <br/>
been chosen I will design a *commemorative poster* for the event. It <br/>
will have a blank area at the bottom for everyone to stamp their <br/>
*signature stamp* on. Then I will scan all of the stamps, add them to <br/>
the poster digitally, and print the final poster up. Copies will be <br/>
available to all members of the event about one week after we <br/>
conclude our shindig. It should only cost a few bucks per copy!<br/>
<br/>
c. Submit brief bio of yourself, LetterBoxing family/group for <br/>
inclusion into the "program" that I am doing up for the shindig. <br/>
(name, when started LetterBoxing, why started, boxes P/F/X, 1 Unique <br/>
LetterBoxing story, etc....please limit it to 1 typed <br/>
page....preferably contain a photo of yourself, some of your stamps, <br/>
etc...)<br/>
<br/>
d. I am also looking into have some of the participants give maybe a <br/>
workshop or class on various subjects. <br/>
             1. Stamp Carving (using your preferred material)<br/>
             2. Compass readings / use of a compass<br/>
             3. Micro-box construction and placement<br/>
             4. etc.........<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What am I missing? Let me know......<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE RSVP with me if you are definately attending...that way I can <br/>
get some hard numbers to be able to plan off of.<br/>
<br/>
OK, if you have any questions PLEASE feel free to contact me.....I am <br/>
open to most all complaints, suggestions, gripes, and tips :-)<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing from everyone....<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Please submit your bio information directly to me..NOT THE <br/>
LIST.... KBuquet@ApertureFoto.com<br/>

September 28 is the Hispanic Cultural Festival in Pocahontas State Park, <br/>
from 11 a.m. - 7 p.m.  Is that going to impact the gathering -- will there <br/>
be too many people in the park and on the trails, or will attendees have to <br/>
pay extra (there's a $7 fee for the festival) to get into the park?<br/>
<br/>
