                    <div class="plaintext-content">When Wanda was in town, on 6-18-03, we went to Woodland Mound and found<br/>
several. I only put the one's that were new for me in my log book that day,<br/>
but maybe Wanda can say which others we found that day there.<br/>
I know we found:<br/>
  Pez Box<br/>
  Oh Deer<br/>
  Crazy Crow<br/>
  Quail Ridge (I pulled this one because it was full of stagnant water and<br/>
top was gone)<br/>
  I think Pond Life was under the Pond (I found it on 8-28-02, but couldn't<br/>
find it 6-18-03)<br/>
  Spring Fever was hard to find, but it was there<br/>
  The Sith Impossible #7 were there too (did these by memory)<br/>
  Owl's Rock<br/>
  Some of the Jurassic, but I don't recall which one's were found and MIA. I<br/>
found them all on 8-28-02, so when I was with Wanda, I know the one's we<br/>
couldn't find were MIA.<br/>
I don't recall the name of it, but we didn't find the one "at the bottom of<br/>
the steps....in a tree"<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps. Some are a bit hard to see or find.<br/>

I haven't been to Woodland Mound park all summer except to check on my<br/>
NightMoves letterbox. It was in its place a couple of weeks ago along<br/>
with a snake taking up residency in my l'box too......Franzsolo<br/>
