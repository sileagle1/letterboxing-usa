Hello noble Letterboxing Friends,<br/>
<br/>
This mailing list is a very refreshing change, indeed.  I went away for two<br/>
weeks and it took me two more weeks to read all the crap on Eric's list.  I<br/>
see Eric has backed down on charging for access to his precious database,<br/>
only to set his sights on the publishing business.  As Susan and others have<br/>
expressed, I, also, am not interested in having my artwork generate money for<br/>
his pocketbook.  I'm going to quit including my images his database.  I am<br/>
glad to see Bonnie and others taking a stand against his schemes.  <br/>
<br/>
Did I, or did I not, predict this whole mess?  I could sense that Eric was<br/>
going to give my good friend Daniel the brush-off.  Daniel:  It is Eric's<br/>
loss, not yours.  Your website has had more appeal than his from the very<br/>
beginning.  He is no letterboxer, he is an entrepreneur.  I love the recent<br/>
changes you have been making.  As you know, I am currently hosting the<br/>
"Letterboxes of Oregon" page, as well as the clues for Thom Chaney's and my<br/>
own letterboxes.  I will continue to provide any help I can to your website,<br/>
including updating my current pages to fit your format, hosting other pages,<br/>
or helping with development.  I can scan stamp images or maps, also, if you<br/>
need this done.  And, as always, feel free to use me as a contact for people<br/>
needing general advise on making a box or carving a stamp.  Oh, and by the<br/>
way, Daniel, you are a jerk, an idiot, and putz.  Am I kicked off your list<br/>
yet?  Just joking, I luv ya, man!!  Don't ever change!!!<br/>
<br/>
Erik:  No I did not jump off a short cliff with a long bungee rope!!  Thanks<br/>
for the concern.  You have done a lot to help keep things civil in all this<br/>
confusion.  And, by the way, you're right...there is strength in redundancy.<br/>
Thank you for voicing your opinions.  The same can be said for Randy.<br/>
<br/>
Thom:  Hi, neighbor!!  Hope you're ready for some more boxes to look for,<br/>
because I plan to get more out soon.  You get extra credit if you find them in<br/>
the rain.  Take an umbrella, though, so you don't get the guestbook wet  :o)<br/>
<br/>
Everybody:  Don't let recent events discourage you.  Diversity is a good<br/>
thing.  Some people will be hooked in by Eric's shiny online catalog.  Others<br/>
will prefer Daniel's services.  Some will distribute their clues through other<br/>
channels.  All this helps to preserve the British tradition of having to work a<br/>
bit to gather your clues.  You know, having conversed with some of our British<br/>
counterparts, I've realized that the catalog that they publish over there<br/>
isn't that big of a factor in the scene.  Not only is it not intended as a<br/>
money machine in the first place, but most hard-core letterboxers don't even<br/>
use it.  They get their clues by word of mouth, or find them in other<br/>
letterboxes.  Who needs fancy databases to spoon-feed us??  It's BETTER that<br/>
everything is not unified.  Let's COMMUNICATE with one another and have some<br/>
FUN!!!!!!<br/>

Amen!  On Eric's list we were "rabid," on this list we're "noble."  I <br/>
