&gt; WOW... I would very much like to meet you all (can't you postpone your trip<br/>
&gt;  to Alaska?...Just kidding).  I will be staying at the Lakeshore Motor Hotel<br/>
&gt;  in Lake Oswego.  I was planning to rent a car Saturday or Sunday (I'm not<br/>
&gt;  sure what day yet because I will be with other people and I'm not sure what<br/>
&gt;  their plans are, other than I don't think they want to play letterboxing<br/>
&gt;  with me) and go to the PCC for some hunting, and then depending on time go<br/>
&gt;  to the Rock Creek hunting ground.  These both seemed to be the closest and<br/>
&gt;  easiest (I'll save the Columbia Gorge boxes for when I am in better shape<br/>
&gt;  and have a little more confidence).<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Wendy!!<br/>
This sounds like a good plan.  The Columbia Gorge boxes are a day trip in <br/>
their own right.  The PCC boxes aren't too hard, as long as you can read a <br/>
compass.  The Rock Creek boxes are loads of fun, and you don't even need the <br/>
compass!!  They also put you in the neighborhood of Yours Truly, as well as <br/>
Portland's unofficial letterboxing hangout, the Rock Creek Tavern.  You will <br/>
note that I've even located the Tavern on the website's map of the Rock Creek <br/>
area.  My phone number is on there too... just so you know, I can sometimes <br/>
be tricked into giving hints to the boxes in exchange for pints of Black <br/>
Rabbit Porter, and obscene phone calls are always welcome... well, except <br/>
when they come from Thom!!   ;-)<br/>
<br/>

Wendy answered:<br/>
&gt;  I am ashamed to say that I don't know.  But there are rattle snakes, ticks,<br/>
&gt;  poisen oak, etc. just to add to the little adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow, I doubt that any of these would slow Thom down much... but those <br/>
darned blackberries seem to have it out for him!!!!  :-)<br/>

&gt;  well! Kevin and I have yet to meet real live Letterboxers :) Too bad Thom<br/>
&gt;  will be out of town... The 9th works for us, as does the<br/>
&gt;  10th but we may be in Seattle on the 11th for a Dragon Boat race.  Let's<br/>
&gt;  work out the details...<br/>
<br/>
As for me... I'm free all weekend!!!  Just say the word, and I'll show up <br/>
quicker than you can say "Letterboxing North America"!!!  Too bad about the <br/>
timing where Thom is concerned... any chance you'll be doing any letterboxing <br/>
in Alaska, Thom?<br/>

Peace, love, laughter, and letterboxing...<br/>

&gt;Hi, Wendy!!<br/>

<br/>
Hints huh?? Do you make them particularly difficult with an alterior motive<br/>
(actually a direct motive, pints).  I did notice the Tavern on the site and<br/>
thought that it held a particular significance to the webmaster.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Somehow, I doubt that any of these would slow Thom down much... but those <br/>
&gt;darned blackberries seem to have it out for him!!!!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some planting is in order. ;)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;As for me... I'm free all weekend!!!  Just say the word, and I'll show up <br/>
&gt;quicker than you can say "Letterboxing North America"!!!  Too bad about the <br/>
&gt;timing where Thom is concerned... <br/>
<br/>
I'll let you know as soon as I know.<br/>
<br/>
Later, Wendy<br/>

I'll check the map &amp; see if there are any boxes where I think I'll be<br/>
heading.  I am not in command of the trip and I know little about the<br/>
destination. .... all I know is we'll be 100 miles south of Anchorage on<br/>
the Kenai peninsula...  something called "Clam Gulch."  That was enough<br/>
to get me interested in going....<br/>

Thom,<br/>
Sounds like a good place in Alaska for an Oregonian to place a letterbox!!<br/>
<br/>
Actually, according to Mapquest, Clam Gulch is 18.5 miles away from Soldotna, <br/>
Alaska, home of the Tsalteshi Trails series of letterboxes.  Maybe you can <br/>
sneak away for a while!!!<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, I hope you have a good time... I have yet to venture up to <br/>
'Seward's Icebox', though many of my dreams reside there.<br/>
