I don't even remember how to diagram a sentence, much less why.<br/>

&gt; Why not?  Of course, why not?  I have no problem with anyone using GPS <br/>
&gt; for their clues.  Their box, their clues.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wouldn't be finding the box because of my previously stated beliefs, <br/>
&gt; however someone else might find it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The truth is, though, that most letterboxers wouldn't find it either <br/>
&gt; because they don't have a GPS or think as I do.  It's not that they <br/>
&gt; are afraid of a GPS, as was stated, but it's that it's not inherent to <br/>
&gt; letterboxing and an expense a lot are not willing to bear for an <br/>
&gt; occassional box.<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
I beg to differ.  While I do not have a GPS, I know many letterboxers <br/>
who do and who would, yes, use it to find a box if the clues call for <br/>
it.  In fact, I know several boxes where the clues do call for it.  <br/>
Aardvark in an argyle sweater anyone?<br/>
&gt; That does not mean, however, there should be a push to make more boxes <br/>
&gt; based on GPS clues to justify the cost.  That would become something <br/>
&gt; else altogether--either geoboxing or lettercaching or Binx (I made <br/>
&gt; that name up cause, well, it's really not letterboxing as a whole if <br/>
&gt; we change it in such a drastic measure across the board.)<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
I fail to see how it would be so drastic a change.  I mean, think about <br/>
it, you have a clue.  You use the clue to go find a box that has a <br/>
logbook and a stamp in it.  What difference is a coordinate clue from <br/>
say an encryption clue or a photographic clue.  It is simply a different <br/>
way of disseminating said clue.  If you don't want to find the box, that <br/>
is up to you.<br/>

&gt; I think you often have valuable things to add to a discussion.  But <br/>
&gt; name-calling, even in comic strip form, is not the way to get anyone <br/>
&gt; to listen to you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Go for a walk, listen to some music you like, carve a phenomenal <br/>
&gt; stamp, but give yourself a break from reading the lists and posting <br/>
&gt; for a while.  Your blood pressure will thank you.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I find that I enjoy this list and others best when I am on no-mail.  <br/>
&gt; I read the messages web-only, when I choose to do so, rather than <br/>
&gt; having them come to me as they occur.  At times I go weeks (months?) <br/>
&gt; without checking in on a list, sometimes I browse messages twice a <br/>
&gt; day.  The messages are there, waiting for you, when you're in the <br/>
&gt; frame of mind to read them.  And it doesn't seem so personal.<br/>
