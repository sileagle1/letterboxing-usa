                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have several "orphan" boxes. Some of them gained that <br/>
status when we moved from NJ to CA.  We decided against <br/>
bringing them in and some of them have been adopted by <br/>
kind souls.  Other of our boxes started life as orphans.  <br/>
We get to North Dakota about once or twice a decade for <br/>
example.  These real orphans are different from our other <br/>
boxes.  We have taken greater pains to hide them.  The <br/>
note books are larger and the box is much more rubust.  <br/>
For the ND and SD boxes we have used ammmo cans for the <br/>
outside container. Nothing is forever though and if and <br/>
when these boxes pass on we will remember them with <br/>
fondness and not regret. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just saw a post worried about orphan boxes by those planted on <br/>
vacation. I want to plant one at a beautiful spot I am revisiting <br/>
this summer/fall and hadn't thought about maintaining it. (I can't <br/>
regularly make that drive to the other side of the state, my sad <br/>
little car will fall apart).<br/>
How do you guys feel about accepting offers to maintain boxes from a <br/>
kind-hearted local who hadnt gotten to that specific hot spot yet? <br/>
Actually, soliciting an adoptive parent for the orphan, so to speak? <br/>
I really want to make and place the stamp, i think it will be <br/>
terribly succesfull as an "art object" and a great excuse to check <br/>
out a great spot. <br/>
Please send your thoughts,<br/>
