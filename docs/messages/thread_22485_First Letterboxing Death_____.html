But seriously.... Silent Doug's comment about "These are all<br/>
heartbreaking stories, and I'd be very happy to not hear another one<br/>
in my lifetime...." I think we can all agree with that sentiment, but<br/>
there is a particularly scary slant to consider:<br/>
<br/>
Someone will eventually die while letterboxing. Not BECAUSE of<br/>
letterboxing, but while letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it will happen. Not if, but when.<br/>
<br/>
Anything you do that has more than a non-zero chance of death (which,<br/>
let's face it, is anything you do--including doing nothing!) will<br/>
EVENTUALLY cause a death. It's a number game, essentially. Hikers die<br/>
every year out in the wild. So far, it's never happened to a<br/>
letterboxer, but there are FAR more hikers than letterboxers in the<br/>
general public. The numbers just haven't caught up with us--yet.<br/>
<br/>
So look at what does kill or seriously injure people in the wild who<br/>
aren't letterboxing, because those are the same issues letterboxers<br/>
face. Even if you're an urban boxer, there are still risks--car<br/>
accidents, muggings, drive-by shootings, etc. Just sitting at home and<br/>
knitting puts you at risk of a meteorite shooting through your roof<br/>
and killing you.<br/>
<br/>
There's not much you can do about meteors falling through your roof<br/>
short of living in an underground bunker (which has its own risks<br/>
anyhow!), but here's the thing: Most of those incidents you hear about<br/>
on the news--lost hikers, hypothermia, drownings, and such are<br/>
preventable. Pay attention to your surroundings, use a little common<br/>
sense, don't push yourself past your abilities, and don't take silly,<br/>
unnecessary risks. Nothing is more important than your own safety, so<br/>
remember that first and formost. No letterbox is worth endangering<br/>
yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Be safe--don't become a statistic. <br/>

Poison sumac grows in wetlands, is tree-like and has 7+ erect leaflets on<br/>
red stems. It doesn't fall into leaves-of-three, let it be rule. Poison oak<br/>
is primarily west of the Mississippi river and poison ivy is primarily east<br/>
of the Mississippi. They all, however have white/green berries...and all<br/>
parts of all three plants can give you the rash...roots, stems, leaves,<br/>
flowers, berries....bare stems in mid-winter etc.<br/>
<br/>
The snake rule: Red NEXT to black is a friend of Jack, red NEXT to<br/>
yellow -kill a fellow (the coral snake and its mimic, the sinaloan milk<br/>
snake and other mimics all have red, yellow and black coloration, but the<br/>
placement is key) is only true in North America. In Central and south<br/>
america, there are poisonous snakes where red is next to black. Not that<br/>
anyone will be searching for boxes in Brazil, but I figured I should clarify<br/>
since it's not universally true.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, back to what you were doing.... :-)<br/>

Well, my wife and I are newbies, so so far we haven't done anything<br/>
*really* stupid, but we sure have learned a few things:<br/>
<br/>
It's always farther than you think (a mile+ hike when you have a<br/>
sprained achilles tendon is not a lot of fun.)<br/>
<br/>
It's always hotter than you think. (Why didn't we bring that bottle<br/>
of water?)<br/>
<br/>
There's always bugs (why didn't we bring the bug spray?).<br/>
<br/>
And I can't remember, does poison ivy have shiny leaves of three or<br/>
not? (where's the tecnu?).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We now have an "official" letterboxing backpack.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Someone will eventually die while letterboxing. Not BECAUSE of<br/>
&gt; letterboxing, but while letterboxing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, it will happen. Not if, but when.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anything you do that has more than a non-zero chance of death<br/>
(which,<br/>
&gt; let's face it, is anything you do--including doing nothing!) will<br/>
&gt; EVENTUALLY cause a death. It's a number game, essentially. Hikers<br/>
die<br/>
&gt; every year out in the wild. So far, it's never happened to a<br/>
&gt; letterboxer, but there are FAR more hikers than letterboxers in the<br/>
&gt; general public. The numbers just haven't caught up with us--yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So look at what does kill or seriously injure people in the wild<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; aren't letterboxing, because those are the same issues letterboxers<br/>
&gt; face. Even if you're an urban boxer, there are still risks--car<br/>

Yeah, that's pretty much my rule about snakes. =) I take it to more of<br/>
an extreme level, though, and like to give ANY wild animal lots of<br/>
room. It's not even about them being dangerous or anything, but I tend<br/>
to feel like I'm just a visitor to their environment and they deserve<br/>
the same respect as if I were to visit a person's home. So I prefer to<br/>
give all animals a wide berth if I can help it. If an animal reacts to<br/>
me, I'm too close.<br/>
<br/>
Snakes and I have a special understanding, though. I leave them alone<br/>
if they leave me alone. =)<br/>

that I am one of those ones who has pushed limits of how dark it is <br/>
or where I was a time or two for the sake of another box, but I've <br/>
had some experiences that changed my mind.<br/>
<br/>
I hear people talking about danger on the trail, but my scariest <br/>
experiences letterboxing have been in urban areas.  I got out in the <br/>
middle of Paris, all alone, and as two men were coming up to me and <br/>
acting in a very threatening manner, the weight of realization hit <br/>
me that I had gone way out of my way in a city where nobody knew me <br/>
and with nobody waiting for my return.  If I didn't show back up at <br/>
my hostel they would have probably thought I just didn't want what <br/>
small luggage I had left there.  Who knows how long it would have <br/>
been before anyone was alerted to look for me. My own family <br/>
probably wouldn't have realized something was wrong until long after <br/>
damage was done. I had also managed to look for a box that was so <br/>
well hidden that anything could have happened and nobody would have <br/>
been the wiser.  I was terrified. <br/>
<br/>
Really it ended up being a great learning experience for me.  I <br/>
share it with you all again to remind you that safety is a real <br/>
issue--regardless of where we are at.  I should have never gone <br/>
alone to that spot.  What started as a fun adventure quickly became <br/>
one of my more frightening moments.<br/>

Me too, and I will be honest that I love boxing alone, I <br/>
also box with my three year old daughter, and believe me, <br/>
sometimes i wish I was alone! She is awesome but to big to <br/>
put in a back pack, and to young to really enjoy the <br/>
hiking.<br/>

three-year-old daughter at least every other week because she loves it so much  and <br/>
I want her to always have an appreciation for the outdoors and want her to  <br/>
have a sense of adventure.  I have limited myself thus far letterboxes that  <br/>
are in familiar parks and places.  The few out-of-state letterboxes I have  done <br/>
I take a family member.<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping that as my children get older they will want to do the more  <br/>
adventuresome boxes in the White Mountains and boxes that you have to paddle to  <br/>
find.<br/>
<br/>
My husband doesn't "get" my passion for letterboxing but he supports me and  <br/>
has found 4 boxes with me so far.<br/>

We recently returned from an extended boxing trip and at our last <br/>
stop at Twin Lakes, Bridgeport, Ca. there was a posting at a <br/>
trailhead we were using regarding an overdue backpacker. From the <br/>
description of him, his gear,listing of his route, and other <br/>
information it was obvious that this guy was very experienced, had <br/>
all of the right stuff and had left a thorough description of his <br/>
intended route. The description of his gear was pretty telling as <br/>
other hikers were asked to be on the look out for any of his stuff <br/>
or pieces of the equipment. He has been overdue since August 8th. <br/>
I'm sure this guy had done sufficient backpacking to realize the <br/>
consequences of doing it alone.<br/>
 Ryan has posted at AQ on the Home page a listing for "Code of <br/>
Conduct". Under that general heading is several informational topics <br/>
and articles regarding security. This should be obligatory reading <br/>
for all letterboxers. If you letterbox alone do you understand the <br/>
consequences and are you ready to face them? Even if you letterbox <br/>
with someone else there is some things you should consider.<br/>
