My sister-in-law is trying to get other home schoolers in her area to start<br/>
boxing. Could some of the home schoolers who are already active boxers write<br/>
what you and your kids have gotten out of boxing? I was explaining that<br/>
although I am not home schooling my kids that the kids and I learn something<br/>
new just about every-time we go boxing. A lot of the boxes are based on<br/>
literature and characters from history. I have visited great forts and<br/>
wonderful locations that I never would have known about with out boxing.<br/>
Navigation and map reading is another learning tool I have been using with<br/>
my kids.  How about you?<br/>

We are a homeschooling family in IL.<br/>
<br/>
The letterboxing article in Smithsonian drew me in because, when I read it, I was just teaching the kids about compasses and cardinal directions and how to use and read a map.<br/>
<br/>
Since then we have gone letterboxing (and geocaching) on family field trips to ... The St. Louis Zoo, Mount Rushmore,  Devil's Tower, the Statue of Liberty, Valley Forge, Pierre Marquette, Cahokia Mounds, Osage Fort, Lincoln's Father's Home in GreenUp, IL. and those are the ones I can remember.  As a homeschool family we always read up on the places we visit ... actually searching the area and following clues makes the history even more alive and memorable.<br/>
<br/>
Other benefits and activities have been:<br/>
<br/>
adventure,<br/>
imagination,<br/>
good thinking skills,<br/>
family fun,<br/>
hiking with family and friends and other homeschool families,<br/>
rock and fossils hunting while letterboxing,<br/>
one box is near an awesome geode hunting location,<br/>
tree ID and leaf collections <br/>
Animal tracking  ... my son cherishes a deer rub walking stick he and his dad found on a hike.<br/>
We also spent time learning and practicing the Dewey Decimal system before the kids search for the library box I placed.<br/>
<br/>
Writing poems and clues for the letterboxes is part of education.<br/>
<br/>
We have even introduced letterboxing and geocaching to area gifted school programs and the local fifth grade teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Christopher Columbus and Lewis &amp; Clark and other explorers and map makers had to learn and employ directional and map making skills in order to accomplish their goals.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>
