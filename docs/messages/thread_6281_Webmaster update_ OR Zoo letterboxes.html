                    <div class="plaintext-content">This series was in the Portland area. I'm sad to say that only the<br/>
Winking Eagle is still on zoo grounds.  We knew this was a risky<br/>
series when we placed them but decided to go for it anyway. Once<br/>
spring sprung the very diligent grounds crew got to work and the<br/>
hordes of visitors arrived. They have taken their toll.<br/>
Congratulations to the early stampers who collected the now defunct<br/>
series but the remaining stamp is a beauty. Come and get it. Funhog of<br/>
The Traveling Circus.<br/>
