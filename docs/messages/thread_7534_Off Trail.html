                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have thought about this question quite a bit myself.  Some of the <br/>
boxes I have put out are in places that have posted trail rules about <br/>
staying on trail.  These I have placed trail-side, which is certainly <br/>
much more difficult to find hiding places that 1) will not be <br/>
accidentally discovered by a curious passerby; 2) will not require <br/>
the box-hunter to disturb the area in their search; but yet 3)lend <br/>
themselves to at least semi-challenging clues.<br/>
<br/>
In other places where staying on trail is not mandated, I try to keep <br/>
the majority of the traveling on established trails and when the <br/>
clues do stray away from the path, look for areas that are not <br/>
densely overgrown, fragile terrain or habitat to delicate plants or <br/>
flowers, in which case my presence may damage the landscape or leave <br/>
a defined path.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's just a matter of observing the rules of the place you <br/>
are at, and then letting common sense and environmental <br/>
responsibility lead you from there.<br/>

&gt; I have been under the impression that we should be hiding our boxes <br/>
in a way that does not require disturbing the area in order to <br/>
retrieve the box.  (Leave no trace)  In my mind that has meant not <br/>
placing anything really "off trail".  I have the good fortune to live <br/>
surrounded by Acadia National Park and know the havoc that is done to <br/>
this area by all the visitors who would rather make their own trail.  <br/>
So,  my question is this:  What are people's "rules of thumb" <br/>
regarding where you plant?  How far "off trail" do you tend to go?  <br/>
So far my plants have been where the searchers will be walking on <br/>
shoreline or climbing on ledge - so nothing to trample.  I would <br/>
really like to hear others thoughts on this.  Thanks for your time.<br/>
