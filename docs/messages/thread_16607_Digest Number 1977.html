<br/>
Apparently Six Flags Inc has decided that out of the thousands of events<br/>
around the world named Fright Fest, that I can not use that name anymore and<br/>
have decided, acting on an anonymous tip, to send me a cease and desist<br/>
order for trademark infringement of the term 'Fright Fest'.<br/>
<br/>
To the webmasters of the letterboxing.org site, please remove any and all<br/>
references to the words 'Fright Fest'.<br/>
<br/>
To everyone else, sorry, but please don't refer to that gathering by that<br/>
name anymore, I really don't want to try and tangle with Six Flags Corp over<br/>
the use of their trademark.<br/>
<br/>
And for those that are curious, try typing in Fright Fest at Google.<br/>
