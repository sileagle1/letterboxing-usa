<br/>
What a beautiful day, weather was perfect and even the wives were happy to<br/>
see us leave! :-)<br/>
<br/>
First box at the North Head Lighthouse was pretty easy and the view<br/>
beautiful!<br/>
<br/>
Second box was a bit more challenging!<br/>
<br/>
Hey Amanda and John, I've got your python! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Nice short hike and but we had a hard time but we finally found it. Sheesh!<br/>
If it had been a snake we both were long dead and eaten!<br/>
<br/>
I think you last to sightings were about 4 degrees off to the left. Yeah<br/>
thats it! We aren't blind and a bit slow and/or stupid!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, nice places and I love Lighthouses! Got some super pictures, watched<br/>
Bald Eagles and Hawks and had a great time.<br/>

Thanks to Glenn &amp; Bill for checking out the Ft. Canby Lighthouse Series.<br/>
Sorry if my compass coordinates were off.  I only have a dinky $3<br/>
compass from REI and, if truth be told, I'm not going to get any credit<br/>
for being a genius at the use of a compass, that's for sure!  <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure glad you were able to find both boxes and I'm really glad you<br/>
enjoyed your visit to the lighthouses there.  It is a beautiful place!<br/>
We look forward to getting the time to find your letterbox at Point<br/>
Defiance one of these days.  <br/>
<br/>
The Pacific NW is starting to get some great letterboxes out there and,<br/>
I for one, am thrilled!!!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I hid another box in Tacoma today at a nature park. Will be posting the<br/>
instructions soon. Have another ready for my third Tacoma location, might<br/>
get it out tomorrow. I love these long weekends!<br/>

In fact, was overjoyed that someone's been over there to hunt them down.<br/>
Glenn, I'm glad that you are out there placing boxes in the Tacoma area.<br/>
It just means we'll have more reason to get up there.<br/>
<br/>
As for today...John and I are talking about spending a good portion of<br/>
it on some Der Mad Stamper letterboxing.  It may be an adventure of<br/>
frustration and futility, but knowing Der Mad Stamper we'll end up<br/>
seeing some beautiful spots and may possibly score a stamp image.  My<br/>
smarter half will probably figure out compass clues and I'll follow<br/>
along and gain finds on his merit!  We're a pretty good team.  He<br/>
usually leads us to the place and I usually find the actual letterbox<br/>
when it comes to compass clues.<br/>
<br/>
Happy 'boxing everybody!<br/>
