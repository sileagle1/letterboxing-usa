Block Island, RI.  We found the following boxes: <br/>
<br/>
Saturday, 20030503: <br/>
<br/>
North Lighthouse.  The box was open, the log was unbagged, exposed, <br/>
and very damp, and the stamp was broken in two pieces.  We put <br/>
everything back together as best we could with new bags, but that log <br/>
is likely to grow mold if it isn't tended. <br/>
<br/>
Treasure Chest.  In place, dry, and intact. <br/>
<br/>
Southeast Lighthouse.  In place and dry.  The stamp pad is missing.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday, 20030504: <br/>
<br/>
Indian Cemetery.  In place, dry, and intact. <br/>
<br/>
Clay Head Trail.  In place, dry, and intact. There was quite a bit of <br/>
incipient poison ivy on the trails of Block Island, especially on <br/>
Clay Head Trail.  Fairly harmless now, it will become tall enough to <br/>
pose a problem as the weather warms. <br/>
<br/>
We didn't attempt to find the Block Island Vacation box as it has <br/>
been reported missing <br/>
<br/>
Monday, 20030505: <br/>
<br/>
White Rock at Black Rock.  In place, dry, and intact.  A very popular <br/>
box, many messages have been left by hunters and other non-boxers, <br/>
several of them visiting more than once. <br/>
<br/>
Dingoes at Dinner Time.  We hit this mystery box on the way back from <br/>
the island so that Rustypuff could add it to her book.  It was in <br/>
place, dry, and intact. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the placers for luring us to these beautiful spots!<br/>
