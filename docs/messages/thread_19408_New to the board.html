I am new to the board, but I have been boxing for about a year. My <br/>
name is Katie, I am 29, and myself and my daughter enjoy boxing. We <br/>
recently started planting our own boxes too, so check them out. Went <br/>
boxing today, and found the Sagamore Hill Letterbox, and Looked for <br/>
but could not find the Gateway to the Cape Cod Canal Letterbox, I <br/>
wasn't sure if the cedar I was supposed to look under was in part of <br/>
the restricted area because of birds nesting. If anyone knows the <br/>
answer we would appreciate it. Recently came across the Black Bear <br/>
Paw Hitchhiker, found it in Sharon, Ma. It has been set free. Just <br/>
wanted to identify myself. Happy hunting<br/>

<br/>
We just searched out your box in Bird Park!  Good one!  You took us <br/>
to a part of the park we didn't know was there.  One thing, the <br/>
wooden bench you mention, is not there.  There were tire tracks on <br/>
the path so its possible they removed it for repair or repainting or <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway from one board newbie to another... WELCOME!!  I hope to see <br/>
you on the trail!<br/>
