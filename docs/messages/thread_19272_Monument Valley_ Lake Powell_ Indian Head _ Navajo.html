<br/>
My girlfrind and I have been touring thru the 4 corners region <br/>
checking out the sites and catching a few letterboxes enroute. <br/>
However, we fear that someone has been thru the Northern Arizona <br/>
boxes and cleared them (either that, or we really are THAT bad at <br/>
letterboxing).<br/>
<br/>
The 4 boxes in question - Monument Valley, Lake Powell, Indian Head <br/>
&amp; Navajo Bridge all have relatively straight forward clues too. We <br/>
visited them all over the 19th to 20th June.<br/>
<br/>
At the Lake Powell site we even found a pen (from Doubletree Hotel) <br/>
in the location described. It looked like it had been deliberately <br/>
left there.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else been out to the 4 corners region recently and had a <br/>
similar experience or found them? <br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
<br/>

The area seems to get a bit of traffic though and I suppose it could <br/>
be accidentally found. I have not found the others you mentioned yet <br/>
but they are on my short list. A shame if they are no longer there.<br/>

I have found a few boxes in this area, but it hasn't been very <br/>
recently.  I found the Monument Valley box on 3/30/03.  It was <br/>
exactly where the clues said it would be and not hard to find.  I'd <br/>
guess this one is gone if you couldn't find it.  I think I was the <br/>
first finder and I left a hitchhiker in the box.  I don't know if <br/>
you mentioned the 4 Corners letterbox, but I found that one in March <br/>
of this year alive and well.  I haven't been to the Lake Powell, <br/>
Indian Head or Navajo Bridge.  Don't know if that helps really.  We <br/>
have so few boxes in S. UT I'd hate to think so many are missing, <br/>
but...   Jill from UT<br/>
