<br/>
Difficulty - simple<br/>
Time - drive up<br/>
Directions to starting place - Route 149 to the center of Deering, New <br/>
Hampshire.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Details you should know - can't think of anything that important.<br/>
<br/>
Facts that you don't need to know, but may find interesting - <br/>
The town was named for Governor Wentworth's wife, Frances Deering.  At <br/>
one time Deering had eleven public schools.  One of the two remaining <br/>
buildings is this library.  In 1860 Deering had several stores, many <br/>
water mills, three post offices, two hotels and many successful farms. <br/>
 Ebenezer Locke, the man who allegedly fired the "shot heard round the <br/>
world" at Lexington, Massachusetts that began the Revolutionary War is <br/>
buried in Deering.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:		<br/>
On Route 149 near the town hall and the church look around for the <br/>
Deering Public Library.  It's sort of behind the town Hall.  Stand <br/>
directly in front of the DPL sign so that you can read it.  Go to the <br/>
left two steps then right five steps.  The books you seek are behind a <br/>
small stone next to a foundation rock.    <br/>
