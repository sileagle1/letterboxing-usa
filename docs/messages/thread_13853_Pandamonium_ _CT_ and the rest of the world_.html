Pandamonium at Morgan Zoo<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
http://www.psychokiwi.org/letterboxing/Pandamonium.htm<br/>
<br/>
(A mystery series - feel free to join in and add to the zoo, but please keep<br/>
in the mystery spirit.)<br/>
<br/>
Newsflash! The bars are down, the walls have tumbled, and all the animals<br/>
have escaped their keepers at Morgan Zoo (Bates Woods Park, New London, CT).<br/>
Rumor has it, they have split into groups, spread out in all directions, and<br/>
have gone to ground hiding. Can you track them down and help them in their<br/>
bid for freedom???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Zoe Zebra<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
News just in from Zoe Zebra (who got a message out on the<br/>
catbird-underground-gossip-train) that the Polar Bears and she were seen by<br/>
the keepers making their way up Route 32 under cover of darkness. They took<br/>
fright, ran into the woods, and aren't sure where they are. They are all<br/>
quakering with fear! But then they found a message to back-track from A very<br/>
nice rock (luckily she found a Lantern to help her find the way in the<br/>
dark). Exhausted they fell asleep, and at daybreak saw they were under an<br/>
old beech tree. From there they followed a white trail through thick laurel,<br/>
skirted the bottom of a steep ledge, then trotted down hill. The trail<br/>
turned left at a triple-trunked oak tree. Immediately behind the tree, they<br/>
noticed a square glacial erratic. About 10 steps in from the trail Zoe found<br/>
a zebra-sized hiding spot in another smaller erratic behind the square<br/>
erratic. Thankful, she crawled in and hid. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Polar Bearing<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There was no room for the polar bears so they went further a-field, leaving<br/>
the following incoherent message with Zoe (you know how polar bears get when<br/>
they are tired and scared!). "After Zoe hid, we met up with 9 laughing<br/>
penguins and 5 happy leprechauns and danced away. Then 14 angry tigers<br/>
chased 23 cheery unicorns down the path! We followed from a safe distance.<br/>
Then we chased 24 smelly mice and 4 nasty hob-goblins up a hill. Exhausted,<br/>
we spied a lovely big rock and found a hidey-hole in the base. I hope<br/>
someone finds us soon!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kuddly Koala<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We also hear that the Kuddly Koala has hopped on a Qantas flight back to Oz<br/>
and is hiding out in a Queensland safe-house. We hope to make contact soon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dancing Dolphin<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also to hand, the Dancing Dolphin was smuggled into New Zealand where he is<br/>
hiding in a Wellington safe-house awaiting further instructions. <br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned for further details - you'll read them here first! <br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
