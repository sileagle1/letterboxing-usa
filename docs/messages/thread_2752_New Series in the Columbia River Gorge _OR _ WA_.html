I've started a new series which I call the "African Safari Series of <br/>
the Columbia River Gorge".  It's a mouthful, but you can call it <br/>
the "African Safari Series" for short if you want.  <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, my recent trip to Africa has inspired the stamps <br/>
that make up this series.  For all of you who want to do a "safari" <br/>
without the expense or troubles of going all the way to Africa, NOW'S <br/>
YOUR CHANCE!  =)<br/>
<br/>
In the past week, I've hidden the first three of the series:<br/>
<br/>
Nesmith Point: Placed July 4, 2001<br/>
Mount Defiance: Placed July 7, 2001<br/>
Beacon Rock: Placed July 8, 2001<br/>
<br/>
The clues can be found at <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Letterboxing/AfricanSafari<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how you'll want to present the clue on the letterboxing <br/>
website since it spans multiple counties--and even multiple states!  <br/>
However, a good central location to use as the nearest town could be <br/>
Cascade Locks (OR).<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking perhaps listing the series twice, once for both Oregon <br/>
and Washington, and the number for how many boxes make up the series <br/>
be included for how many are in each of the two states.  <br/>
<br/>
So Washington would say something like:<br/>
<br/>
Nearest Town:  Stevenson<br/>
County: Skamania<br/>
Number in series: 1 (So far, at least)<br/>
<br/>
And Oregon would say something like:<br/>
<br/>
Nearest Town: Cascade Locks<br/>
County: Hood River<br/>
Number in Series: 2 (So far....)<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?  Have I confused things enough as it is?  =)<br/>

How about listing those that are in Washington, on the Washington <br/>
Page, with text that advises of the others in the series in Oregon.<br/>
Do the reverse on the Oregon listing.<br/>
Just a thought..<br/>

The link for the series goes to the same page whether someone is <br/>
looking for Oregon or Washington letterbox clues (it is one series, <br/>
after all), so either way you follow the links, you'll get clues for <br/>
the complete series.  As a result, I don't think advising of the <br/>
other state would be necessary.  <br/>
<br/>
Each clue will mention whether it's in Washington or Oregon in the <br/>
directions, and all of them are fairly close together.  If someone <br/>
was thinking about finding boxes in the gorge, they might very well <br/>
try to find them on both sides of the river in the same day!<br/>
<br/>
I figure, at worst, people will click on one or the other expecting <br/>
to get letterboxing clues for either Oregon or Washington, but find <br/>
both there and think, "Who cares?"  It's a series meant specifically <br/>
for the Columbia River Gorge which--by definition--covers both <br/>
states.  So I don't think it would confuse anyone too much.  I don't <br/>
really want to separate out the Oregon clues from the Washington <br/>
ones, because they're all in the same place: the Columbia River Gorge.<br/>
<br/>
If only they thought ahead and decided to name the area north of the <br/>
Columbia River different than the area south of the river, I wouldn't <br/>
be in this mess.  We'd just have two distinctly separate series.  =)  <br/>
What politician had the brilliant idea to create areas that span <br/>
political boundries?  What's up with that?<br/>
