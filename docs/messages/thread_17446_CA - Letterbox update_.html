<br/>
Weather was absolutely gorgeous, so we decided on the spur of the <br/>
moment to head west to Berkley to search for a few boxes. After an <br/>
unscheduled "pit stop" to buy running shoes for my 5 yr old (no-one <br/>
thought that the cute dance shoes she wore would be inappropriate!!) <br/>
we managed to get a few in...<br/>
<br/>
Go Bears! Series #1 Tightwad Hill<br/>
<br/>
Only car in the parking lot sooo... up we went! Had a chance <br/>
to "break-in" my new walking stick my wife (Mrs Jiggs) hand carved <br/>
for me for Christmas! Spectacular view! Box was fine, and fairly well-<br/>
visited. We left a little "surprise" for the next visitor!<br/>
<br/>
Go Bears! Series #2 Big "C" <br/>
<br/>
After (foolishly) deciding to cut a corner and climb straight up to <br/>
the next path, we made it to the top! Another spectacular view <br/>
awaited us! This box was also in great shape! Noticed that we were <br/>
the first visitors since early April '03!<br/>
<br/>
down we went and off to: Tilden Park<br/>
<br/>
Forgot Princess Lea's clues on the kitchen table, so went after<br/>
<br/>
Big Fish in a Small Pond<br/>
<br/>
Nice little hike with clever clues! Box was in great shape!<br/>
<br/>
We were fortunate to see the sun set through the Golden Gate bridge <br/>
accross the bay - all you CA LBers - if you haven't had the chance to <br/>
see this spectacular view, try to find time to do so!<br/>
<br/>
After a great supper at Saul's Deli in Berkley, we headed for home.<br/>
<br/>
A pit stop in Davis gave us the opportunity to check on the<br/>
<br/>
In n Out Burger box<br/>
<br/>
In great shape, well-visited. Book is getting kinda full, and got wet <br/>
once, so a bunch of stamps have been smeared. <br/>
<br/>
Planning to return next week to pick up the Tilden Park stamps we <br/>
missed.<br/>

I planted your Halloween Witch HH, which I got at the SLO Gathering, <br/>
in a Sierra Madre LB on November 27th, where it was discovered the <br/>
next day by another pair of letterboxers who are moving it along to <br/>
parts unknown.<br/>
