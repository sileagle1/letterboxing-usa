                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, just a quick request for all of you with the Salem Quest clues.  PLEASE DO NOT hunt for the Salem School Quest during school hours.  We are really on edge about visitors right now, and the presence of a person walking around the property and looking suspiciously around trees and bushes would most likely put the school on alert and cause a lock down.  I DO NOT want to be responsible for that.<br/>
<br/>
            Thank you in advance for respecting my request.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Maybe the fact that we are at war??? I was read the riot act by the Army <br/>
Corp of Engineers regarding the boxes at Hop Brook Lake. They are willing to <br/>
work with me to keep the boxes there but if a hiker happened across one and <br/>
reported it they would probably close down the area and call the bomb <br/>
squad....with guns!!<br/>
I suppose it's a good warning to letterboxers right now...if its government <br/>
land GET PERMISSION!!!!!!!<br/>
