Hello!<br/>
<br/>
We'll be visiting Australia and New Zealand in a few months and would <br/>
really appreciate learning of letterboxes there.  So far, we have info <br/>
about Team Psychokiwi's boxes in New Zealand.  Thanks in advance for <br/>
any help! ....Boatman and Mystery Gal (RetiredHavinFun)<br/>

NZ letterboxes is at<br/>
www.psychokiwi.org/letterboxing/nzboxing.htm<br/>
This is every box I know about (with publicaly available clues) - there has<br/>
been a flurry of placings in the past month or so too. AtlasQuest<br/>
(atlasquest.com) also has excellent international coverage, but I don't<br/>
think there are any NZ boxes there that aren't already on my list.<br/>
<br/>
There is only one box I know of in Australia, it's an urban box in Geelong,<br/>
in a somewhat salubrious sounding place. <br/>

As I described recently on the traveler's list "Letterboxing is TRICKY in<br/>
Australia. We did try placing one last time we visited, but had to abandon<br/>
the attempt (partly lack of time, but partly we just couldn't find a safe<br/>
place). The thing is, Australia is filled with poisonous snakes, nasty<br/>
spiders, and all sorts of other critters that you just don't want to come to<br/>
close to (unless you're Steve Irwin!). And all these critters love little<br/>
hidey holes under rocks and in old trees. And if, like us, you're not from<br/>
those parts, it is hard to know who is friend and who is foe. If nothing<br/>
else, take a hiking pole or something you can use to poke into those dark<br/>
spots! Then stand well back!"<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
