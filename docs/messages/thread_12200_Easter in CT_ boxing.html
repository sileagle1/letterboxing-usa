The Hardy Hikers "Mixed Nuts" and had fun with Calvin and Hobbes. <br/>
Note for The Hardy Hikers...<br/>
Started off great with the sound of birds, an almond and a cashew. We <br/>
walked in circles to find peanut and acorn. <br/>
Acorn is MIA. (not sure if you know this your log book noted a <br/>
problem with acorn from previous hikers). <br/>
The walnut,pecan and chesnut were easy to find once we were able to <br/>
identify which trail we were on. The pecan was wet inside but we were <br/>
able to dry it out easily.  <br/>
It looked like a new information board was being constructed which is <br/>
GREAT because we REALLY needed a trail map!!<br/>
<br/>
The Calvin and Hobbes box was challenging!!  We could not pass up on <br/>
the box once we saw the clue format! The whole family enjoyed the <br/>
challenge of the climb. Great "overview" of the waterfall and great <br/>
stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Our next time out we will be planting "Fred" our HH from Dust to <br/>
Dust.<br/>
Thanks to both for planting your boxes.<br/>
The "B" in CB and J from NJ<br/>
