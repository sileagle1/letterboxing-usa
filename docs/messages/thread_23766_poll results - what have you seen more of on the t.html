Smart armadillos exist only in legend and the minds of small<br/>
children, along with other myths like Smokey Brains, motorcycle<br/>
doors, the Toothfairy and the Easter Bunny.   They're just not dead,<br/>
yet! :p<br/>

Why did the oppossum cross the road?<br/>

Nobody knows.  None of them ever made it!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Every once in a while in Texas while hiking, we will see a "smart <br/>
&gt; &gt; armadillo".  For those of you that don't know what I mean, it is <br/>
&gt; an <br/>
&gt; &gt; armadillo that is still alive!  Usually you see them as <br/>
the "Texas <br/>
&gt; &gt; speed bump" ....  partially flattened on the road.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;  I think I've seen just about every animal available in this <br/>

&gt; &gt; some I've seen many times. I saw a Deer Sunday that was missing <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; lower part of hits hind leg and was still running around. There <br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; also the one I hit with my truck while returning from a trip. <br/>
