The Zodiac? Here in Sacramento??? Yay, I can't wait! :-D<br/>

I think we finally found our set of carving tools at the Folsom <br/>
Michael's, after an extensive tour (though not quite as much as <br/>
yours). Used to be that you could just order stuff on their website, <br/>
but they've removed the shopability (dumb move, you ask me). <br/>

I also found my first stamp carving materials at the local Michael's <br/>
in Pasadena (CA), and carved my first stamp.  But I found materials I <br/>
liked better at The Art Store.  They not only had various Speedball <br/>
cutters, but also a carving material called SPEEDY-CUT carving block <br/>
(by Speedball), which, though more delicate than the "pink stuff," is <br/>
much easier to carve.  Carving is a breeze with this stuff; you just <br/>
need to glue it to a wood backing, since it's more delicate.  <br/>
