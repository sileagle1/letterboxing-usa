activity!  (P1F16x0) How fun! Please forgive me everyone,  but I've <br/>
been reading the posts, and reading them, and reading them,  and I <br/>
still need to ask, How do I adopt a box? From the letterboxing.org <br/>
website I sent a message to the webmaster about it, but don't know <br/>
what to do next. It's still listed as abandoned. Also, I have to <br/>
agree with the gentle reminder.. when talking about boxes, please <br/>
include the state. I have a hard time following. <br/>
Finally one more question... will there ever be a point when there <br/>
are too many letterboxes?  Nearly 150 in one town is a lot isn't it? <br/>
I'm personally planning a weekend there.... but geez...<br/>

Rings in Heaven needs the ink pad replaced...and I can't seem to <br/>
contact an owner? Perhaps it is you? Or you know who it is? <br/>
If not, I would like to take care of it. <br/>
