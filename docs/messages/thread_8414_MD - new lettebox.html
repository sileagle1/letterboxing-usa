placed by:  Firefly<br/>
October 15, 2002<br/>
Sugarloaf Mountain<br/>
Nearby town: Barnsville, MD<br/>
County:  Frederick<br/>
Difficulty: easy<br/>
<br/>
Finnegan was quite the athlete.  He loved to ride his bike everywhere because it kept his legs muscular and toned.  He was small, but he was scrappy!  He had heard about this place called Sugarloaf Mountain, so he decided to try to conquer the mountain.  He rode his bike through the main entrance and drove up, up, up.  Being as small as he was, it took him a while and by the time he got to the top he was starting to get tired.   He decided to head to the west to check out the view.   Up he drove until he saw a brown Snack Shack.  He thought this would be a perfect place to grab some french fries and find a place to spend the night. So he parked his bike in the lot near the Snack Shack.  Unfortunately, the Snack Shack seemed to be closed for the season.  He might have to come back during the summer so he could check out the yummy treats.  In the meantime he looked around for a cricket to munch on.  <br/>
<br/>
Up behind the Snack Shack he noticed a trail map and a green trail heading off into the woods.  Being green himself, he thought following the green trail might be the best way to find a place to store his bike and himself for the night.  The trail was a little too rocky for him to ride his bike, so he walked the bike up.  <br/>
<br/>
Soon, he came to some wooden steps and he spied a first green blaze on his left.  After admiring the lovely green color of the blaze, he glanced over to his right and saw  a huge downed tree.  It was the perfect place to spend the night!  Finnegan hoisted his bike up into the roots of the downed tree.  He was very careful to make sure that the tree trunk was not occupied by any other woodland friends.  Then he snuggled down for the night.<br/>
