replacing the box and watching the birds. They are pairing up and doing housekeeping on their mega-nests. <br/>
The trees were absolutely filled with birds. There was also a vocal flock of Sandhill Cranes feeding in the field <br/>
(along with a guzillion geese) and a couple did a fly-by while I was there. Ducks, hawks and songbirds also <br/>
made an appearance. While I was in the area, I also checked on the Discovery Trail Box and found it waiting <br/>
patiently for its next visitors. Funhog<br/>
