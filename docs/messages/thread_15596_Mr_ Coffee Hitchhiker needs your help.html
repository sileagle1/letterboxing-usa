Mr. Coffee made an appearance at today's gathering in Northern California <br/>
-- I brought him from the Barb of the Hook box in Gettysburg. I'm not sure <br/>
who picked him up to take him to a new destination, but I think most of the <br/>
people at the gathering will see your message here on the list and so <br/>
hopefully they'll respond.<br/>
