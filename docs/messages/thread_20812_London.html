You'll love the experience of being out of the country, enjoy!!<br/>
We'll be in France in November on a castle hunting expedition, so if you <br/>
find websites for boxes in Europe, let me know, ok? I got some help from the <br/>
NE list, but I could use some more.. Thanks<br/>

<br/>
While the Baker's Dozen were in London, Box Hound and I looked for one London box... the one near the Brunswick Center apartment/shopping complex... Sadly it wasn't to be found.  We did find some paper and an old tennis ball in it's spot though... and I am happy to say nothing else... last thing I'd want to have done is extend my stay in the UK becuase of an animal bite.... try explaining that one to the ER doc...  <br/>
<br/>
"Well, sir, I was standing on someone's knee reaching into a downspout about 8 feet off the ground... I really didn't see what bit me"<br/>
<br/>
lol...  I've heard that most of the London boxes have gone missing... Hopefully you'll have better luck and we did.<br/>

&gt;...going to...London...anyone know of any boxes to be found there. <br/>

I don't know about LBs outside this country (obviously they're <br/>
there), but I do know a little about London...<br/>
<br/>
Do you like fish and chips? Good! Go to the Rose&amp;Crown near <br/>
Hyde Park (I think). It's THE absolute best fish &amp; chips ever. <br/>
It's right next to the original Hard Rock Cafe. Across the street is <br/>
a stop for the BigBus... <br/>
http://www.bigbus.co.uk/uk/html/uk_home.html. <br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend the double-decker ride through London. <br/>
The light-hearted British-humour tour guides will make you laugh!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck LBing in the "home of letterboxing" (close enough!)!<br/>
