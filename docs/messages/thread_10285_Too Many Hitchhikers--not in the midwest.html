                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmm.  I've never found a hitchhiker, but I've only found about 15 <br/>
stamps of any kind (see what kind of a letterboxer I am,  I don't <br/>
even know my current number--and it's a small one).  I placed one <br/>
that probably wouldn't be considered creative enough by those who've <br/>
found lots of hitchhikers (although it did at least have a hand-<br/>
carved stamp), but it was found by someone who'd never found a <br/>
hitchhiker before, and it was on her birthday, so she was delighted.  <br/>
I do want to mention another benefit to hitchhikers that I haven't <br/>
seen go by.  I placed mine first in a box that very quickly showed up <br/>
missing.  When I learned that the hitchhiker had escaped before the <br/>
box was stolen I felt that at least something had been salvaged, and <br/>
I'm very reassured to know that it's now safe in at least its third <br/>
home in six weeks.     <br/>
