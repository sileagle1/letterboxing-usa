upstate NY and settled in Colorado.  Thanks all you New York 'boxers <br/>
for the great places you led us to while we were there.  We will <br/>
miss NY!<br/>
<br/>
As for you Colorado 'boxers, we're looking forward to adding a few <br/>
Colorado Fs and probably a lot of Ps to our count.  Not too many <br/>
boxes in Colorado right now, so consider this a challenge to plant <br/>
more!  We'll be doing our part!<br/>

year as the Ly and Bean parts of JeLyBean are still in NY and won't <br/>
be joining me until late Nov, and I am under express orders not to <br/>
find any boxes without them.  Come spring, though....<br/>
