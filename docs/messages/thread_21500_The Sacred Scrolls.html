past the large birch tree just as the Great and Wonderful Creator had <br/>
instructed. And though they were sorely tested and their bodies were <br/>
much abused by the trip,  they found themselves rich at the end of <br/>
their travails. For in the grey rock's nook they didst find the Carving <br/>
in rubber lying next to the Logbook, both enclosed in the Tupperware of <br/>
Safety and camouflaged by the Holy Detritus. And Lo, they didst have <br/>
upon them the Sacred Colors and were thus rewarded with the ability to <br/>
collect the Inverse Image they had so dutifully sought.<br/>
<br/>
Blessed are the Box Planters for they shall be rewarded with Signatures <br/>
of the Seekers by the multitudes.<br/>

&gt; Oh great box creator please let me partake of many pieces of carved<br/>
&gt; rubber doused with wonderful brilliant dye and pigment liquids so that <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; may place yet another reversed image upon my parchment journal to<br/>
&gt; increase my collection and allow me to say " look. I have more than<br/>
