My family and I are eager to dive into this new hobby. I got psyched <br/>
after reading the article in Family Fun magazine. We've got a four <br/>
year old and an 18 month old -- so we'll start with the easy ones for <br/>
now. We live in Jacksonville, FL... but are moving to Brunswick, <br/>
Maine in just a few weeks. We're hoping to find a few boxes in FL <br/>
before we leave. We're making one last trip to see the mouse (you <br/>
know, the one with the amusement parks, movies, tv and other <br/>
incessant marketing). So I hope we can track down the three Disney <br/>
boxes, though when reading the archives it seems one or more may have <br/>
been confiscated. Can anyone give me status reports on Bald Cyress or <br/>
St. Augustine's Lighthouse. We're also thinking of trying for the <br/>
ones in Deland and Palm Coast. Any advice would be welcome! I have a <br/>
couple of general questions: When you go letterboxing as a family, <br/>
does everyone have their own stamp, or do you have one family stamp?<br/>
What does "unclaimed box" mean? Does it mean it doesn't exist or is <br/>
just in need of care? Should I "contact the placer" to check on it's <br/>
status? It seems like Maine is much more interesting territory for <br/>
Letterboxers, so even if we get discouraged here in FL, we're eager <br/>
for new adventures in Maine. Peace, Deborah<br/>

With us (myself, my partner, 12 yr. old daughter, and 3 1/2 yr. old <br/>
daughter) we all have our own stamp and journal. We help the little <br/>
one with her stamp though. If not, she'd stamp the logbook 50 times <br/>
over. LOL<br/>
I think it's basically what you feel is best for all of you.<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

<br/>
I'm just starting in this hobby and designing stamps for carving.  I <br/>
am doing a "family stamp" which I will use.  It will be a simplified <br/>
version of my husbands family crest. (Has to be simple, I've never <br/>
done this before!)  Then I'm giving my two youngest kids (7 and <br/>
almost 9) a project of designing a picture to carve.  So we each will <br/>
have a stamp to use.  We will also carve a stamp for boxes that we <br/>
place... a little at a time tho, LOL, I'm over anxious and want to do <br/>
this yesterday!  But we have to get the stamp carving figured out <br/>
first.  :O)<br/>
