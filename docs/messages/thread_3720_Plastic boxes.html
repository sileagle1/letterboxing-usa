                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is a really good point.  Hiding stuff in ammo boxes, or other <br/>
large metal containers, doesn't seem like such a good plan.  I'd sure <br/>
hate to be the one the law enforcement contacts wondering what the <br/>
heck I was thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I was under the impression, our intent to be as conservative as <br/>
possible to the surrounds we place our boxes in?  That doesn't sound <br/>
like using metal or large containers.  I'm also in favor of regular <br/>
checking of boxes and if you can't, either getting someone else to or <br/>
retiring the box all together.<br/>
