nearest town DeLand FL, but it's in<br/>
Lake County<br/>

A beautiful 8 mile loop nature trail...box is about 1 mile in.<br/>
Leashed dogs fine.<br/>
Mosquito and tick protection recommended.  Your feet may get wet if it has <br/>
been rainy.<br/>
Use a restroom in town; bring water and snacks - there is nothing out here <br/>
but you, Mother Nature, and the Nekkid Redneck!<br/>
<br/>
100 years ago, when paddlewheelers drove the commerce of central Florida, <br/>
there was a town called St. Francis just across the St. John's River from <br/>
DeLand.  It had hotels, boarding houses, restaurants, homes, a thriving <br/>
agricultural business, and was a major trading center for goods bound for <br/>
inland towns.  Merchandise was loaded onto oxcarts and driven to points west <br/>
such as Mt. Dora and Eustis.<br/>
<br/>
When the railroad was built on the DeLand side of the river, paddlewheelers <br/>
were abandoned - some were literally run aground and left to rot - and the <br/>
town of St. Francis died.<br/>
<br/>
If you do the entire loop instead of turning back after stamping up, you <br/>
will see some of the old oxcart roads and the foundations of the town.  You <br/>
will also see more of The "Real" Florida - hammocks, swamp, springs, palms, <br/>
pines, live oaks.<br/>
