<br/>
Your trip does sound ambitious, and fun, and hard!  I have also been <br/>
working on the idea of the trail for a while...  I am probably 5 <br/>
years out from doing it as a thru hiker. <br/>
<br/>
If you read one book before you go, I'd most highly suggest Ray <br/>
Jardine's Beyond backpacking.  And I really suggest you look into <br/>
carrying a camping hammock instead of a tent.  Enough techno talk.<br/>
<br/>
As for the stamps, mail them to yourself at a dozen or a score of <br/>
post offices.  To :AT Thru Hiker.  It's the way to get special <br/>
supplies to yourself.  Best is to have someone mail them so they <br/>
arrive about a week before you arrive at the post office box.  <br/>
<br/>
You will find that you can leave email from a lot of libraries in the <br/>
towns along the trail that you will no doubt want to visit.  An email <br/>
to this list would get your clues on the website right away.<br/>
<br/>
As for needing a name, with your real name of Ryan, I believe a great <br/>
trail name would be Clancy, or Clancy's Ryan.  <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
<br/>
Rick aka Flyfisher <br/>

&gt; This thread certainly seems to have come out of nowhere!  But it <br/>
&gt; sounds like a fun discussion, so I'll throw in my two cents for <br/>
what <br/>
&gt; I will do.  Or might do.  I still reserve the right to back out at <br/>
&gt; any time!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm looking into hiking the Appalachian Trail!  I only got the idea <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; couple of weeks back but took to it like a fish in water.  <br/>
According <br/>
&gt; to my "sources", the typical thru-hiker is thinking about the hike <br/>
&gt; for ten YEARS before starting the adventure, so I've got some <br/>
serious <br/>
&gt; catching up to do!  But wow, what an adventure!  Over 2,000 miles <br/>
&gt; from Georgia to Maine and through 12 other states, on foot.  They <br/>
say <br/>
&gt; the elevation gain of all the hills adds up to climbing Mt Everest <br/>
&gt; from sea level to the top 16 times!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I'm thinking of creating a letterboxing series along the entire <br/>
&gt; route.  The world's longest letterboxing chain.  I'm thinking <br/>
perhaps <br/>
&gt; a letterbox every 20 to 25 miles sounds good (which adds up to <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; 100 letterboxes!)  That might be a little too ambitious, though, <br/>
&gt; since I'll probably be too tired to carve a new stamp virtually <br/>
every <br/>
&gt; day.  Unless I can pre-carve most of them before I hit the trail, <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; that's still a lot of stamps to be carving!  And since Internet <br/>
&gt; access is limited when you're miles away from the nearest <br/>
&gt; civilization, I might not even have a chance to type in all the <br/>
clues <br/>
&gt; for a hundred boxes along the way.  But it's a dream of mine.  =)  <br/>
A <br/>
&gt; series that stretches for over 2,000 miles along the east coast.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And if I'm REALLY lucky, I'll finally get a chance to meet a bunch <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; you east coast folks I've always heard stories about and swap e-<br/>
mails <br/>
&gt; with all the time!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But gosh, that's my next BIG adventure I'm thinking about.  My feet <br/>
&gt; are sore just thinking about the trip, but my spirits are high!  =)<br/>
