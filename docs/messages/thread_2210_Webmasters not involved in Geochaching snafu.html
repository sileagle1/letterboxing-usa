    Your Webmasters  DID NOT authorize or participate in this recent<br/>
attempt to sign you on to the geochaching site.  It seems as though<br/>
we've been slammed.  I think all you have to do is respond in a "remove"<br/>
mode.  That is what I will do.<br/>
<br/>
    A fundamental difference between the groups is the Letterboxing<br/>
reminders about preserving wild species and care of our natural<br/>
resources.  Leave nothing behind but footprints.  Your Webmasters have<br/>
spent a great deal of time on developing a clearer understanding of what<br/>
the relationship should or should not be between the groups.  This is<br/>
still unresolved.  Please share your feeling (nicely) with us by sending<br/>
your comments directly to the Webmasters email.<br/>
<br/>
    Also, please do not unsubscribe to our list, this will be loss to<br/>
all of us who persevere to find the simpler things in life.  Keep faith,<br/>

mailing list account to the Geocaching mailing list. Do not send unsubscribe<br/>
requests as the list is already unsubscribed. It will just cause unnecessary<br/>
confusion.<br/>
<br/>
As for your second comment, I am personally offended by your judgemental<br/>
tone. We are just as concerned about the environment as you claim to be. The<br/>
difference is in the game. Part of Geocaching, just like letterboxing, is<br/>
leaving containers for others to find. The means to arriving at the geocache<br/>
is just different. Neither of us "leave behind nothing but footprints," but<br/>
we both attempt to minimize the impact of either of our sports/hobbies.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
