Yale Forest, Ashford, CT, USA<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Adorphus the Pedantic on 2/24/2002<br/>
Location: Nipmuck Trail, Yale Forest, Ashford, CT<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it was inevitable that Adorphus the Pedantic would get himself into <br/>
trouble when his dragon flew south on her mission to help a friend.  How <br/>
often had she warned him about the Pixies-their cunning, their guile, their <br/>
feigned innocence?  Maybe he thought she was too cynical in the way that <br/>
dragons sometimes are thought to be.  Or, maybe he was overconfident in his <br/>
own prowess as a Mage and Pedant.   Or, maybe he thought the Griffon could <br/>
protect him.  Most likely, he simply forgot!   Whatever the explanation, <br/>
Adorphus and the Griffon choose to venture a quest in the Dragon Lady's <br/>
absence.  They went to hide the Tupper Treasure (though really maid out of <br/>
rare rubber that can withstand even the microripples of evil magic).  <br/>
<br/>
Their goal was a point prior to the juncture where the noble Mucks (who were <br/>
known to take a Nip on occasion) rendezvous with the Northern Natchaug at the <br/>
end of its trek.  (Legend has it that Straub &amp; Molly left a treasure there <br/>
also).  To get to their own destination Adorphus &amp; the Griffon had to walk <br/>
part of the same road as Thomas Hooker once trod on his way from Hartford to <br/>
Boston.  From the south on Route 89 one crosses Route =(88/2) in the village <br/>
of Warrens (though I don't think the Warrens refer to rabbit holes--perhaps <br/>
gnome burrows).  From the blue, yellow, &amp; green torch proceed north 2 &amp; 7/10 <br/>
miles.  Take a right on the lane that leads to where the Dwarves mine the <br/>
iron for their battle axes. (Or, coming south from exit 71 off I84 on <br/>
Turnpike to Route 89 you must pass at least 4 red pentagonal signs warning <br/>
you to STOP-a sure sign this quest is a dangerous one.  Five miles from the <br/>
bridge at the exit and 1 mile from the last sign, turn right at the church <br/>
West of the ford where the flickering red torch warns of magical dangers <br/>
ahead. Proceed south on Route 89, 1 &amp; 3/10 miles.  Take a left on the lane <br/>
that leads to where the Dwarves mine the iron for their battle axes.)  There <br/>
are signs that tell of the way of the Nipping Mucks.   Turn left onto the <br/>
dirt road &amp; park.  <br/>
<br/>
When first they saw where the trail was leading Adorphus exclaimed to the <br/>
Griffon "where in the blue blazes is this taking us?"-because 480 wizard <br/>
paces from the turn off is the ruins of "Elves Eves," that once mighty castle <br/>
that stood at the entrance to the Land of Faire.  Sadly today only the <br/>
foundation remains--haunted by the shades of those elves who gave up their <br/>
immortality to defend these woods from the hordes of horror.  Beware; those <br/>
horrors still walk these woods!  [OK, so Adorphus is a little melodramatic as <br/>
well as pedantic &amp; loquacious.]  Adorphus &amp; the Griffon followed the trail <br/>
blazed by the blue blood of the fleeing elves.  They turned right and walked <br/>
40 wizard paces, only to turn left and pass through the ruins of the mighty <br/>
wall that once guarded the Land of Faire.  About 150 wizard paces from the <br/>
wall they crossed a deceptively peaceful brook.  Two hundred seventy-five <br/>
wizard paces from the brook is a right turn in the trail with a wall to the <br/>
left and another 20 wizard paces to a gap in that wall.  From there 320 <br/>
wizard paces brought them to yet another wall.  Passing through this wall <br/>
they unwittingly entered the domain of the Rock Trolls.  Ninety wizard paces <br/>
latter, the Griffon climbed a large bolder to the right of the trail to <br/>
survey the way ahead, only to have the bolder shiver and shake beneath her.  <br/>
Looking down she found herself perched on the back of a giant Rock Troll!  <br/>
Adorphus &amp; Griffon ran for their lives (after all, they are pacifists).  To <br/>
escape they had to flee straight through the land of the Rock Trolls and pass <br/>
almost directly beneath their citadel which can be seen up high and to the <br/>
left of the trail.  Rushing ahead with mad Trolls at their backs they were <br/>
relieved to see a sign on their right proclaiming "90 wizard paces to the <br/>
abode of your friends and allies the Pixies."  That the way was marked with <br/>
the red blood of mortals should have given them pause, but with the Trolls at <br/>
their backs they paid no heed.  There, by the gently falling water, danced a <br/>
pride of pixies.  As tiny as they were (about 2 to 3 inches tall) the Trolls <br/>
kept their distance.  At the base of the Falls a murky swamp showed signs of <br/>
being the lair of a Revaeb, whose teeth can cut a large tree in half.   "We <br/>
come in peace" said Adorphus, though the Griffon snarled and looked <br/>
suspicious.  The pixies just laughed and danced about kicking dust into the <br/>
air and singing:<br/>
"Pixie dust,<br/>
Pixie sleep,<br/>
Take Adorphus<br/>
Under deep."<br/>
And with that Adorphus fell asleep!  But the Griffon was too fast and leapt <br/>
across the falls &amp; into the grove of mountain laurel which the pixies dared <br/>
not enter.  As soon as Adorphus was unconscious, the pixies began to attack <br/>
the Tupper Treasure with their microripples.  But the rare rubber was <br/>
resistant to the ripples and the receptical remained sealed.  As the pixies <br/>
pried at the package the Griffon snuck up and licked Adorphus in the face.  <br/>
Griffon slobber has magic resisting properties because it comes from a <br/>
mythical beast.  Awake and aware again, Adorphus thought fast and arrived at <br/>
a solution.  He offered the pixies a truce, a treaty, and a trade.  In <br/>
exchange for safe passage to the Tower of Power, he would leave the Tupper <br/>
Treasure with them.  Further, anyone else is to be granted safe passage <br/>
through the realm of the pixies, provided they stamp the ledger in the Tupper <br/>
Treasure.  <br/>
<br/>
To locate the treasure, go to the base of the great fallen tree that lies <br/>
parallel to the falls.  With your back to the roots of the tree, take 15 <br/>
wizard steps toward the Revaeb's swamp.  There you will encounter a rock <br/>
carved into four parts to form a magic X.  The treasure is hidden under the <br/>
ledge of one of these rocks.  Linger awhile to enjoy the realm of the pixies <br/>
before traveling on to find Chuck &amp; Molly's Letterbox.<br/>
