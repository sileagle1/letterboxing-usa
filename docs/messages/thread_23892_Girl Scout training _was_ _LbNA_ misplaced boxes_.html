                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think having a training for adult leaders is a great idea!  I think most<br/>
scout leaders want to do a good job, but in some cases like letterboxing,<br/>
simply don't know how to go about it properly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Before I go further, I want to make it clear I do not pass my opinions on<br/>
ALL Girl Scouts, but the ones I've had problems with are the ones that seem<br/>
to treat letterboxing as an isolated activity.  The best ones I've dealt<br/>
with have made a greater effort to get involved in the letterboxing<br/>
community and they make great letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't specifically read the badge requirements myself personally, but<br/>
from talking to the unit leaders in my area that I know, it sounds like the<br/>
units around here that are promoting letterboxing among GS troops are in a<br/>
lot of ways missing the whole point, I think.  Or maybe they are using<br/>
letterboxing to make the point they want to make, without regard to the<br/>
nature of the game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since some of the local units have begun boxing, I've noticed a higher<br/>
percentage of boxes missing or with problems.  Almost invariably when I go<br/>
out to check on a box, I find that the next to last log entry is a gaggle of<br/>
girlie names and store-bought stamps and a note something to the effect of<br/>
"This is so much fun!".  I really am glad they are having a good time with<br/>
it, but the reason I checked the box was because someone came after them and<br/>
reported a problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I notice is that they don't seem to emphasize respecting the effort of<br/>
creation which goes into a box or respect for other finders  I've seen<br/>
girls who have stamped all over previous finders' stamps because the log ran<br/>
out of pages.  I rarely, rarely receive an email acknowledgement from Girl<br/>
Scouts, and it all combines to make me believe they see it as little<br/>
different than going to play a game of putt-putt.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That said, I do not fault the girls with these problems  the problem is in<br/>
the failure of leaders to do a good job of understanding letterboxing before<br/>
they pass it along to the girls.  And I believe most leaders would be<br/>
willing to do a better job, if they knew the job they are doing isn't up to<br/>
snuff.  All in all, a training is a great idea!<br/>

a lesson for them, and I think that's the best of all worlds - she's gotten<br/>
familiar with the activity so she knows it well enough to teach it, and she<br/>

choose 4 of them if you are a brownie and six of them if you are a junior.<br/>
So, even if carving is an activity toward the patch they may not choose it.<br/>
I do think conserving space would be a good point to make.  I don't like to<br/>
stamp in on the back of a page where others have stamps strictly because the<br/>
owner of the box may want to scrapbook the pages later.  I noticed most of<br/>
the books in boxes I have found do not have stamps on both sides.  We do<br/>
stamp more than one stamp on the same side of the page though.  The sealing,<br/>
hiding and being discrete will definitely be high on the priority list<br/>
though.<br/>

<br/>
I letterbox with my Camp fire group (13-16 years old) and with my 4 <br/>
year old son. <br/>
I've only been "caught" once and that was by someone that knew all <br/>
about letterboxing and we were stamping no were near where the box <br/>
was actually planted. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried to teach them everything they need to know. They <br/>
currently use store bought stamps that are 1/2 inch x 1/2inch very <br/>
small so they can all have a stamp, but we aren't using up pages on <br/>
a log book. (we are going to try to carve some, but I know I'm <br/>
having a hard time with it)<br/>
 I do plan on taking them to a site and let each one search for, <br/>
stamp and replace the box individually. I will check it after each <br/>
girl and make sure that everything is done correctly. If there is an <br/>
issue I will be able to address it with the person that has the <br/>
problem. Until that time I try to make sure that everything is <br/>
replaced corectly before I walk away. Have i ever forgotten - could <br/>
be, but I do try. <br/>
The other thing I did was the second outing was a verRRRYYY long <br/>
hike (all day) in a less then easy walk area. I figured that if <br/>
letterboxing wasn't for them - that hike would do it. and it was in <br/>
August - I'm lucky I'm not floating in the lake. They all came back <br/>
again for it so I guess they really do enjoy it. <br/>
<br/>
The other thing I do is I try to scope out the area before I take <br/>
them. If I don't think it will work - it's a no go. <br/>
<br/>
The person that I've had the most problems with ??? My 50 + year old <br/>
mother - she can't keep her mouth shut when we meet someone on the <br/>
trail and she doesn't understand that why the planters don't mark <br/>
where the letterboxes are hidden with a BIG note that says LETTERBOX <br/>
HERE with a big arrow pointing to it. I'm hoping the next big hike <br/>
will do her in :)!<br/>
Sorry to go on and on....<br/>

&gt; The mom of one of the Girl Scout families that has really gotten <br/>
into<br/>

planning on doing<br/>

she's gotten<br/>

My first thought is why invite trouble?  :o)<br/>
<br/>
My second thought...  Why not just offer your services to the council's <br/>
troops *if they so desire* rather than offering to come do training <br/>
when there hasn't been an expressed interest in the activity *by the <br/>
girls*.<br/>
<br/>
I know that might seem confusing, but here's my train of thought on it.<br/>
Girl Scouts is all about the GIRLS--the girls are the ones who are <br/>
suposed to choose their own badges/areas of interest.  Unfortunately, <br/>
I've known many troops throughout my years in scouting, where the <br/>
leaders decide what the troop is going to do.<br/>
<br/>
When we go out and give training to the leaders, the leaders then take <br/>
this back to the troops and, I feel, there is undue pressure for the <br/>
girls to choose the badges that their leaders guide them to, usually <br/>
because the leaders either have had training in that area or it's an <br/>
area of interest to them personally.<br/>
<br/>
So, by going in and training the leaders without knowing if there is an <br/>
interest in that council from the *girls* point of view, we are leading <br/>
them to letterboxing and frankly, perhaps the girls just wouldn't have <br/>
normally chosen that badge to begin with and, from our point of view, <br/>
it's better not to have people letterboxing unless they have a vested <br/>
interest in it.<br/>
<br/>
So, call the council and offer your services to any TROOP who requests <br/>
it.  That way, you are more assured that the girls have expressed an <br/>
interest in the activity and you haven't just sparked an idea in a <br/>
troop leader's head about a way to 'entertain' the girls.  It's also <br/>
easier to teach the nuances of letterboxing to smaller groups.<br/>

<br/>
******************<br/>
<br/>
The problem I see with extending that offer to the council is that you have<br/>
to assume that when the girls express an interest the first thought that<br/>
runs through a troop leader's head is "Oh hey!  Let me call my council to<br/>
see if they have a training opportunity for this..."  I know that with girls<br/>
scouts as well as cub/boy scouts (which is where my own involvement is both<br/>
as a council trainer and as a unit leader) in our area, unless it is a<br/>
down-the-line traditional scout activity like camping, the first thought of<br/>
a unit leader isn't to seek help from the council.  It sure wouldn't hurt to<br/>
let your council's training folks know about it, but I wouldn't count on<br/>
units learning of your offer through the council.<br/>
<br/>
As with so many things in letterboxing, I think the best approach is to lay<br/>
the groundwork and be prepared for the interest when it occurs.  For anyone<br/>
who has ever lived in a low box population area, you probably realize that<br/>
the best way to attract boxers is to plant boxes.  This works for scouts too<br/>
- plant boxes with their names on it, and they will come out, and they may<br/>
well contact you for help since you've offered boxes geared toward them.  I<br/>
have a Cub Scout series and a Girl Scout series myself.<br/>

I understand what you are saying.  When I led troops of older girls, <br/>
though, part of exploring a new area of interest was  for the girls <br/>
to  find out where to get training in it, hence my suggestion to make <br/>
it girl driven rather than leader driven.  I'm a stickler for scouts <br/>
being scout driven rather than leader driven....I'm just funny that <br/>
way!  :o)<br/>
<br/>
A group of great ladies in RI got together a few years ago to make <br/>
and plant a group of boxes for GS at their private camp.  This is an <br/>
excellent way to give them the opportunity to learn about <br/>
letterboxing.  Many times councils offer opportunities for troops to <br/>
get together with other troops for different events at camp--this <br/>
would be an opportune time to offer a bit of training directly to the <br/>
girls.<br/>

If you contact a leader in the area they can tell you who the service unit<br/>
director is.  I know the service units around here are always looking for<br/>
new things to offer the leaders and the girls.  A letterboxing event could<br/>
be planned that the girls and leaders could take part in.  Stations could be<br/>
set up for stamp carving, box building, etc.  That way the leaders can learn<br/>
and any interested girls could learn too.<br/>

If you contact the council in your area they would be able to tell you the<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just had to chime in here. My daughter is a Cadette/Studio 2B. Back<br/>
in September she used letterboxing to achieve part of her Silver<br/>
Award. She and another Cadette in her troop planted a few boxes on<br/>
Girl Scout Campgrounds, created totes that can be signed out from our<br/>
council, and lead two sessions at a recent leaders training weekend.<br/>
She tought roughly 50 adults about letterboxing..including proper<br/>
etiquette. As far as "teaching" letterboxing to a troop, be flexible.<br/>
Brownies should NOT be carving stamps, but foam shapes glued to the<br/>
end of a mini m&amp;m canister works great. Also, to prevent possible<br/>
problems later, try planting a box or two just for the class. This way<br/>
there is no problem with discretion. The box is going to be removed<br/>
anyway. Hope this helps with all of your great ideas for helping<br/>
scouts learn about and enjoy letterboxing.<br/>

one of<br/>

&gt; Why not contact the troup leaders, and ask if you can come to one of<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; meetings (with the girls) to explain it more to them, including how<br/>
&gt; important it is to rehide boxes better, and be discreet, etc? They would<br/>
&gt; take it more seriously if they were getting the info first hand,<br/>
from a real<br/>
&gt; live expert letterboxer.  You could even suggest having a little<br/>
workshop<br/>
&gt; with them to show them how to make their own stamps - maybe do 2<br/>
sessions<br/>
&gt; with them. Lots of times, they're really looking for ideas of what<br/>
to do at<br/>
&gt; the meetings, and since they have a badge for this I would think<br/>
they would<br/>
&gt; go for it.<br/>
