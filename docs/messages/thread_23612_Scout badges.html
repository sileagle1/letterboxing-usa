It's for older girls, but it's there. :-)<br/>

  The girl scout badge I was referring to is indeed for older girls-it's in the Studio 2B section.<br/>

<br/>
The Connecticut Trails Council, Inc has a multi-level  patch on  <br/>
letterboxing (Brownies thru Cadettes).  I have used it with some Girl  <br/>
Scouts at my councils overnight camp and will be using it with my  <br/>
troop next week.  The only "badge" available thru GS USA is the "Hi- <br/>
Tech Hide &amp; Seek".  I have also helped a scout earn this badge.  You  <br/>
definitely need to be an older scout to earn that.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you can create a "council own" or "troops own" badge in  <br/>
letterboxing.  I looked into it, and I thought it was a lot of work.   <br/>
I'm guessing that Girl Scout USA  should  be working on  younger  <br/>
levels soon enough.<br/>
<br/>
I have ended up adopting a letterbox that a Girl Scout troop planted  <br/>
and abandoned. They created it and then the troop disbanded, but  <br/>
forgot to remove the letterbox :(  A temporary box, is probably a  <br/>
better idea.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone would like the requirements for the Connecticut Trails  <br/>
patch, please email me off this list.<br/>
