<br/>
This afternoon John and I headed over to Milo McIver State Park in<br/>
Estacada to check things out.  I don't think I've ever been to this<br/>
park!  It's large and wonderful!  There are two group camping areas that<br/>
are large.  I would like to reserve one of them for the gathering.  That<br/>
way it will be our group's own space and people can come and park or<br/>
camp and I don't think they will have to pay a day use fee if they say<br/>
they are part of the group camp (even if they are just coming for the<br/>
day) and those who wish to camp either Friday or Saturday night or both<br/>
may do so on me.  At least that's how I'm hoping it goes.  More details<br/>
if/when I get the reservation.  Folks will just have to bring their<br/>
letterboxing selves, supplies, families, friends, FOOD, beverages, etc.<br/>
and we can all have a delightful time.  <br/>
<br/>
ALSO...While there we searched for Funhog's Royal Angler.  I'm happy to<br/>
report that this letterbox is ALIVE AND WELL!!!  But it's a lonely<br/>
letterbox.  The only folks who stamped in until today were Ryan and<br/>
Amanda and that was well over a year ago!  The clues did have me stumped<br/>
a couple times and I can see where folks might go to the wrong "nurse"<br/>
initially, but eventually we carried on a bit farther and succeeded.<br/>
This letterbox may not be so straightforward, but once you find it it is<br/>
SO WORTH IT!!!  The stamp is absolutely excellent.  All I have to say is<br/>
if at first you don't succeed, try, try again for you will be greatly<br/>
rewarded.  <br/>
<br/>
Milo McIver has lots of great letterboxing potential.  I'm already<br/>
thinking of two ideas for LB stamps I want to place there.  I think I<br/>
will get this thing together (hopefully group camp isn't filled up that<br/>
weekend) and we will have a wonderful time!!!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
