    We just wanted to thank you for a great day letterboxing in Mansfield.<br/>
Dan &amp; I went out today and found Only Regret (we were the 2nd to stamp in),<br/>
Eaglesville Preserve, Pine for You, Queen of Hearts and Grist in the Mist.<br/>
They were all fantastic.  We would have gone to a couple more, but the sun<br/>
sets so early these days.  Hope to get back soon to find some more.<br/>
        Thanks again,<br/>

Carolyn,<br/>
    We were up in your neck of the woods again, searching out a few more<br/>
boxes before the snow comes.  A few were a little tricky with the thin snow<br/>
cover, adds to the fun and challenge though.  We found Black Fish and Chick<br/>
in Nest, Fuzzy Wuzzy, and One Fish, Two Fish.  It was a beautiful day for a<br/>
hike!  We were hoping to get Paw Print too, but it still gets dark too<br/>
early!<br/>
Thanks for the great hikes!<br/>
<br/>
Melissa (in, how much snow did they say? CT)<br/>
