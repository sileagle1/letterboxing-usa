                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">Years ago we were visiting relatives in the mountains of West <br/>
Virginia (this was before we knew about letterboxing, so no boxing <br/>
stories here).  The area is a national forest and there are signs <br/>
everywhere informing visitors of "bear ettiquiette".  We kept <br/>
telling my niece "Watch for bears, watch for bears."  Before long we <br/>
were driving down this little dirt road through the forest and sure <br/>
enough, there was a bear about 100 feet away, standing in the middle <br/>
of the road. We got so excited, my sister jumped out of the car and <br/>
took pictures... I popped up through the sunroof and took pictures.  <br/>
I'm not sure my poor niece ever even SAW the bear!  (So much for <br/>
bear ettiquiette!)  The bear was frightened by our antics, and took <br/>
off into the woods.<br/>
<br/>
We continued driving and a short time later saw a momma turkey with <br/>
3 babies trailing behind her.  Another great photo op!  (We did make <br/>
sure my niece actually saw the turkeys this time.)<br/>
<br/>
After we got home, we went to the 1-hour photo and got our pictures <br/>
developed... this was before digital cameras were available.  My <br/>
mother looked at our pictures and told us they looked like some <br/>
pictures her father had taken in those same mountains 50 years ago.  <br/>
She pulled out a box of old pictures and dug through them until she <br/>
found the pictures she was looking for.  In the first, a picture of <br/>
a bear standing in the middle of a dirt road.  In the second, a <br/>
momma turkey with 3 little babies trailing behind her.  Comparing <br/>
the picture we took to the pictures my grandfather took, it looks <br/>
like the same road, the same bear, the same turkeys.  It is VERY <br/>
uncanny!  I have both sets of pictures and everyone who looks at <br/>
them is completely amazed.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, totally unrelated to letterboxing, but an interesting <br/>
story nonetheless.<br/>

&gt; of the car and <br/>
&gt; took pictures... I popped up through the sunroof and<br/>
&gt; took pictures.  <br/>
&gt; I'm not sure my poor niece ever even SAW the bear! <br/>
&gt; (So much for <br/>
&gt; bear ettiquiette!)  The bear was frightened by our<br/>
&gt; antics, and took <br/>
&gt; off into the woods.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We continued driving and a short time later saw a<br/>
&gt; momma turkey with <br/>
&gt; 3 babies trailing behind her.  Another great photo<br/>
&gt; op!  (We did make <br/>
&gt; sure my niece actually saw the turkeys this time.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After we got home, we went to the 1-hour photo and<br/>
&gt; got our pictures <br/>
&gt; developed... this was before digital cameras were<br/>
&gt; available.  My <br/>
&gt; mother looked at our pictures and told us they<br/>
&gt; looked like some <br/>
&gt; pictures her father had taken in those same<br/>
&gt; mountains 50 years ago.  <br/>
&gt; She pulled out a box of old pictures and dug through<br/>
&gt; them until she <br/>
&gt; found the pictures she was looking for.  In the<br/>
&gt; first, a picture of <br/>
&gt; a bear standing in the middle of a dirt road.  In<br/>
&gt; the second, a <br/>
&gt; momma turkey with 3 little babies trailing behind<br/>
&gt; her.  Comparing <br/>
&gt; the picture we took to the pictures my grandfather<br/>
&gt; took, it looks <br/>
&gt; like the same road, the same bear, the same turkeys.<br/>
&gt;  It is VERY <br/>
&gt; uncanny!  I have both sets of pictures and everyone<br/>
&gt; who looks at <br/>
&gt; them is completely amazed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Like I said, totally unrelated to letterboxing, but<br/>
&gt; an interesting <br/>
&gt; story nonetheless.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This weekend will be an all day-er on Sat.<br/>

I was a little embarrassed to say that I still prefer my Pentax K-1000 for the artsy shot.  I guess I need to invest in a decent digital and take a few classes.  Somehow it feels like cheating - but think of the savings in film and developing alone!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, but I've been such a domestic delinquent!  The place really needs some attention.  I figure rainy weekends I can do that - but then again, it never seems to be raining hard enough to cancel boxing!  How's that for hard core?? LOL.  As long as there's no lightning, I'm good!  Yep, we're nuts!  But it is just so invigorating - the challenges we've encountered really make us marvel at our ability to conquer many fears.  Can't wait for the next one!  <br/>
<br/>
How old is your son?  Sounds like he's under 8 - hasn't got the fear instinct yet!<br/>

 The bears were so cute (from a distance) just wish the<br/>

 Virginia (this was before we knew about letterboxing, so no boxing <br/>
 stories here).  The area is a national forest and there are signs <br/>
 everywhere informing visitors of "bear ettiquiette".  We kept <br/>
 telling my niece "Watch for bears, watch for bears."  Before long we <br/>
 were driving down this little dirt road through the forest and sure <br/>
 enough, there was a bear about 100 feet away, standing in the middle <br/>
 of the road. We got so excited, my sister jumped out of the car and <br/>
 took pictures... I popped up through the sunroof and took pictures.  <br/>
 I'm not sure my poor niece ever even SAW the bear!  (So much for <br/>
 bear ettiquiette!)  The bear was frightened by our antics, and took <br/>
 off into the woods.<br/>
<br/>
 We continued driving and a short time later saw a momma turkey with <br/>
 3 babies trailing behind her.  Another great photo op!  (We did make <br/>
 sure my niece actually saw the turkeys this time.)<br/>
<br/>
 After we got home, we went to the 1-hour photo and got our pictures <br/>
 developed... this was before digital cameras were available.  My <br/>
 mother looked at our pictures and told us they looked like some <br/>
 pictures her father had taken in those same mountains 50 years ago.  <br/>
 She pulled out a box of old pictures and dug through them until she <br/>
 found the pictures she was looking for.  In the first, a picture of <br/>
 a bear standing in the middle of a dirt road.  In the second, a <br/>
 momma turkey with 3 little babies trailing behind her.  Comparing <br/>
 the picture we took to the pictures my grandfather took, it looks <br/>
 like the same road, the same bear, the same turkeys.  It is VERY <br/>
 uncanny!  I have both sets of pictures and everyone who looks at <br/>
 them is completely amazed.<br/>
<br/>
 Like I said, totally unrelated to letterboxing, but an interesting <br/>
 story nonetheless.<br/>

carve, so my house is a mess as well.<br/>

&gt; Congrats!  I never had a 35mm, but I adore my<br/>
&gt; digital.  It really <br/>
&gt; helps to be able to see a shot right away, and to be<br/>
&gt; able to fix it <br/>
&gt; on the computer later - if say the lighting was off<br/>
&gt; or something.  <br/>

While we were on vac I took 12 rolls of film.  It was<br/>
a fortune to develope.  I ended up with a lot of the<br/>
same shots.  That's really the only reason I wanna go<br/>
digital.  <br/>

<br/>
&gt; Absolutely!  Slow and steady gives you time to make<br/>
&gt; lifestyle changes that make it stick rather than<br/>
&gt; lose it fast to look good until it creeps back on!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was a little embarrassed to say that I still<br/>
&gt; prefer my Pentax K-1000 for the artsy shot.  I guess<br/>
&gt; I need to invest in a decent digital and take a few<br/>
&gt; classes.  Somehow it feels like cheating - but think<br/>
&gt; of the savings in film and developing alone!<br/>

&gt;  &gt;  &gt; on<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; vacation. Decided to go for the Gatlinburg <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  Mountain Top box.  How exciting!  Had to<br/>
&gt; ride<br/>
&gt;  &gt; a<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; chairlift all the way <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  to the top of Mt. Harrison.  I'm deathly<br/>
&gt;  &gt; affraid<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; of<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; chairlifts.  <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  Forced myself to face my fear. Got to the<br/>
&gt; top<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; and<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; it was almost dark.  <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  Determine to find that box.  Borrowed a<br/>
&gt;  &gt; lighter<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; and<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; found it!  This <br/>

 It's too hot to go boxing.  However, it's never too hot or rainy to <br/>
 carve, so my house is a mess as well.<br/>

I really like the mental puzzler clues (well, not all of them).  If I can't get them at all, Ses can usually figure them out in an hour or so.  Really so much fun!  <br/>
<br/>
Boxing in the rain is fun, but not the driving rain - we had to climb a little way up a rock face in the rain to retrieve one box.  Nearly gave up, but we both really don't give up easily - hate to let those buggers defeat us!  We will spend an extra 1/2 hour sometimes on a box that we are certain is gone missing just to be sure!  We are finding that we re much more stubborn than we believed. Not that it's a bad thing, mind you!<br/>

 &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; vacation. Decided to go for the Gatlinburg <br/>
 &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  Mountain Top box.  How exciting!  Had to<br/>
 &gt; ride<br/>
 &gt;  &gt; a<br/>
 &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; chairlift all the way <br/>
 &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  to the top of Mt. Harrison.  I'm deathly<br/>
 &gt;  &gt; affraid<br/>
 &gt;  &gt;  &gt; of<br/>
 &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; chairlifts.  <br/>
 &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  Forced myself to face my fear. Got to the<br/>
 &gt; top<br/>
 &gt;  &gt;  &gt; and<br/>
 &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; it was almost dark.  <br/>
 &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  Determine to find that box.  Borrowed a<br/>
 &gt;  &gt; lighter<br/>
 &gt;  &gt;  &gt; and<br/>
 &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; found it!  This <br/>
 &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  was one of my favorite finds!!  Gotta love<br/>
 &gt;  &gt; this<br/>

&gt; Yeah, the orienteering ones threw up for a loop at first<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I think this may be an incorrect use of the term <br/>
"orienteering".  I looked it up once because it was apparently going <br/>
on in my area and it might be something I'd be interested in -- and <br/>
then found out that it wasn't.  In the sport of "orienteering", you <br/>
start with a terrain map and a compass and have to hoof it through <br/>
the woods to a series of checkpoints.  Each checkpoint has a little <br/>
key that you use to holepunch your card to prove you were there.  The <br/>
first to the finish is the winner.  Yes, it's a foot race!  I have no <br/>
foot speed, so no interest for me.<br/>
<br/>
I have stumbled across those checkpoint stations while out <br/>
letterboxing, though.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; now it's the<br/>
&gt; 'how big is a 'pace' to the planter' that gets us!<br/>
<br/>
The first question is whether it's one step or two!  I avoid that <br/>
issue by using the word "step" instead.<br/>

to find the first couple of boxes we looked for.  I<br/>
have to admit I can get lost in a shoe box. LOL  The<br/>
naturalist at the park we went to had to spend a<br/>
little extra time with me :)  Finally got it!  Went<br/>
back to look for the first two boxes turned out there<br/>
were missing.  Yea the pace versus the steps thing can<br/>
be confussing.  We usually will take the paces and see<br/>
how close we get to something where a box could be<br/>
hidden.  We usually find it.  It really burns me<br/>
though when you send a msg back to the placer that the<br/>
box is missing and they don't do anything about it:( <br/>
Good luck this weekend!<br/>

&gt; Yeah, the orienteering ones threw up for a loop at<br/>
&gt; first, now it's the 'how big is a 'pace' to the<br/>
&gt; planter' that gets us!  I really like the mental<br/>
&gt; puzzler clues (well, not all of them).  If I can't<br/>
&gt; get them at all, Ses can usually figure them out in<br/>
&gt; an hour or so.  Really so much fun!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Boxing in the rain is fun, but not the driving rain<br/>
&gt; - we had to climb a little way up a rock face in the<br/>
&gt; rain to retrieve one box.  Nearly gave up, but we<br/>
&gt; both really don't give up easily - hate to let those<br/>
&gt; buggers defeat us!  We will spend an extra 1/2 hour<br/>
&gt; sometimes on a box that we are certain is gone<br/>
&gt; missing just to be sure!  We are finding that we re<br/>
&gt; much more stubborn than we believed. Not that it's a<br/>
&gt; bad thing, mind you!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gotta hit the sack now, can't keep my eyes open!<br/>

&gt; The<br/>

&gt; rainy<br/>
&gt;  &gt; weekends I can do that - but then again, it never<br/>

&gt;  &gt; How's that for hard core?? LOL.  As long as<br/>
&gt; there's<br/>
&gt;  &gt; no lightning, I'm good!  Yep, we're nuts!  But it<br/>

&gt; "orienteering".  I looked it up once because it was apparently going <br/>
&gt; on in my area and it might be something I'd be interested in -- and <br/>
&gt; then found out that it wasn't.  In the sport of "orienteering", you <br/>
&gt; start with a terrain map and a compass and have to hoof it through <br/>
&gt; the woods to a series of checkpoints.  Each checkpoint has a little <br/>
&gt; key that you use to holepunch your card to prove you were there.  The <br/>
&gt; first to the finish is the winner.  Yes, it's a foot race!  I have no <br/>
&gt; foot speed, so no interest for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have stumbled across those checkpoint stations while out <br/>
&gt; letterboxing, though.<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Orienteering does not necessarily have to be a race.  There are plenty <br/>
of leisure orienteerers (is that a word?) out there.  A bunch of us <br/>
often go to the DVOA events locally just for the fun of doing it.  We <br/>
choose one of the medium courses and walk it, enjoying a day out in the <br/>
woods just like letterboxing.  Mapsurfer is your sport orienteerer <br/>
around here.<br/>
<br/>
I learned orienteering in the Boy Scouts, earned the merit badge.  In <br/>
fact, my sister based her entire Gold Award (Girl Scout equivalent to <br/>
the Eagle Scout) project on setting up and running an orienteering <br/>
course.  It is a great skill to learn as you really learn how to use <br/>
your compass in combination with a map, and how to read a map.  I would <br/>
encourage anyone to give it a try, it'll help you improve your <br/>
letterboxing as well.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Recreational orienteering is a lot of fun, though.  There are different levels of courses--you can do one of the easier courses and go at your own pace.  It's kind of like letterboxing w/out the stamping in--there's the problem-solving element of "what's the best way to get there?" and then the "aha!" moment of actually finding the control.  And the maps are nifty.<br/>
<br/>
  The "sport" guys of course are running through the woods on their own much harder maps.  You just have to make sure you get out of their way (having Mapsurfer trip over you would not be a good way to get his exchange!)<br/>

<br/>
Orienteering (recreationally, Kirbert!) sounds like fun and definitely worthwhile in honing Lb'ing skills.  (Or at least getting out of that shoebox after dark!)  I may try to find one around here.  Since I live very near the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Green Mountains it's a sure bet there are no shortage of courses here.<br/>
<br/>
Get out there this weekend!<br/>

 have to admit I can get lost in a shoe box. LOL  The<br/>
 naturalist at the park we went to had to spend a<br/>
 little extra time with me :)  Finally got it!  Went<br/>
 back to look for the first two boxes turned out there<br/>
 were missing.  Yea the pace versus the steps thing can<br/>
 be confussing.  We usually will take the paces and see<br/>
 how close we get to something where a box could be<br/>
 hidden.  We usually find it.  It really burns me<br/>
 though when you send a msg back to the placer that the<br/>
 box is missing and they don't do anything about it:( <br/>
 Good luck this weekend!<br/>

 &gt; Yeah, the orienteering ones threw up for a loop at<br/>
 &gt; first, now it's the 'how big is a 'pace' to the<br/>

 &gt; puzzler clues (well, not all of them).  If I can't<br/>
 &gt; get them at all, Ses can usually figure them out in<br/>
 &gt; an hour or so.  Really so much fun!  <br/>
 &gt; <br/>
 &gt; Boxing in the rain is fun, but not the driving rain<br/>
 &gt; - we had to climb a little way up a rock face in the<br/>
 &gt; rain to retrieve one box.  Nearly gave up, but we<br/>
 &gt; both really don't give up easily - hate to let those<br/>
 &gt; buggers defeat us!  We will spend an extra 1/2 hour<br/>
 &gt; sometimes on a box that we are certain is gone<br/>
 &gt; missing just to be sure!  We are finding that we re<br/>
 &gt; much more stubborn than we believed. Not that it's a<br/>
 &gt; bad thing, mind you!<br/>

 Actually, I think this may be an incorrect use of the term <br/>
 "orienteering".  I looked it up once because it was apparently going <br/>
 on in my area and it might be something I'd be interested in -- and <br/>
 then found out that it wasn't.  In the sport of "orienteering", you <br/>
 start with a terrain map and a compass and have to hoof it through <br/>
 the woods to a series of checkpoints.  Each checkpoint has a little <br/>
 key that you use to holepunch your card to prove you were there.  The <br/>
 first to the finish is the winner.  Yes, it's a foot race!  I have no <br/>
 foot speed, so no interest for me.<br/>
<br/>
 I have stumbled across those checkpoint stations while out <br/>
 letterboxing, though.<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; now it's the<br/>
 &gt; 'how big is a 'pace' to the planter' that gets us!<br/>
<br/>
 The first question is whether it's one step or two!  I avoid that <br/>
 issue by using the word "step" instead.<br/>

&gt; Great night!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Orienteering (recreationally, Kirbert!) sounds like<br/>
&gt; fun and definitely worthwhile in honing Lb'ing<br/>
&gt; skills.  (Or at least getting out of that shoebox<br/>
&gt; after dark!)  I may try to find one around here. <br/>
&gt; Since I live very near the Adirondacks, Catskills,<br/>
&gt; and Green Mountains it's a sure bet there are no<br/>
&gt; shortage of courses here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Get out there this weekend!<br/>

&gt;                            We ended up taking an<br/>
&gt; orienteering class after failing<br/>
&gt;  to find the first couple of boxes we looked for.  I<br/>
&gt;  have to admit I can get lost in a shoe box. LOL <br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt;  naturalist at the park we went to had to spend a<br/>
&gt;  little extra time with me :)  Finally got it!  Went<br/>
&gt;  back to look for the first two boxes turned out<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt;  were missing.  Yea the pace versus the steps thing<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt;  be confussing.  We usually will take the paces and<br/>
&gt; see<br/>
&gt;  how close we get to something where a box could be<br/>
&gt;  hidden.  We usually find it.  It really burns me<br/>
&gt;  though when you send a msg back to the placer that<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;  box is missing and they don't do anything about<br/>
&gt; it:( <br/>
&gt;  Good luck this weekend!<br/>

&gt;  &gt; Yeah, the orienteering ones threw up for a loop<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt;  &gt; first, now it's the 'how big is a 'pace' to the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; planter' that gets us!  I really like the mental<br/>
&gt;  &gt; puzzler clues (well, not all of them).  If I<br/>
&gt; can't<br/>
&gt;  &gt; get them at all, Ses can usually figure them out<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt;  &gt; an hour or so.  Really so much fun!  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Boxing in the rain is fun, but not the driving<br/>
&gt; rain<br/>
&gt;  &gt; - we had to climb a little way up a rock face in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;  &gt; rain to retrieve one box.  Nearly gave up, but we<br/>
&gt;  &gt; both really don't give up easily - hate to let<br/>
&gt; those<br/>
&gt;  &gt; buggers defeat us!  We will spend an extra 1/2<br/>
&gt; hour<br/>
&gt;  &gt; sometimes on a box that we are certain is gone<br/>
&gt;  &gt; missing just to be sure!  We are finding that we<br/>
&gt; re<br/>
&gt;  &gt; much more stubborn than we believed. Not that<br/>
&gt; it's a<br/>
&gt;  &gt; bad thing, mind you!<br/>
&gt;  &gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Gotta hit the sack now, can't keep my eyes open!<br/>

&gt;  &gt; It looks like Taz went<br/>

&gt;  &gt; never<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  get this gang out in the rain.  I'm getting to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  point where I almost prefer a challenge.  I love<br/>
&gt;  &gt; the<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  boxes where you have to use the compass.  I love<br/>
&gt;  &gt; the<br/>

&gt;  &gt;  &gt; Yeah, but I've been such a domestic<br/>
&gt; delinquent! <br/>
&gt;  &gt; The<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; place really needs some attention.  I figure<br/>
&gt;  &gt; rainy<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; weekends I can do that - but then again, it<br/>
&gt; never<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; seems to be raining hard enough to cancel<br/>
&gt; boxing!<br/>
&gt;  &gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; How's that for hard core?? LOL.  As long as<br/>
&gt;  &gt; there's<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; no lightning, I'm good!  Yep, we're nuts!  But<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt;  &gt; is<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; just so invigorating - the challenges we've<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; encountered really make us marvel at our<br/>
&gt; ability<br/>
&gt;  &gt; to<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; conquer many fears.  Can't wait for the next<br/>
&gt; one!<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; How old is your son?  Sounds like he's under 8<br/>
&gt; -<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; hasn't got the fear instinct yet!<br/>

&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  The bears were so cute (from a distance) just<br/>
&gt;  &gt; wish<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; the<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  pic turned out better!  My son was on my<br/>

&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; missed this weekend so we went out last<br/>
&gt; night<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; just<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; to grab one - we both were sort of in<br/>
&gt;  &gt; withdrawal!<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; This weekend will be an all day-er on Sat.<br/>

&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Wow, bear cubs - that is so wonderful! <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Nothing<br/>
