After a delicious Chinese dinner at the "Pu Pu Hot Pot",  we had time<br/>
to kill before meeting up with son, "Pi 'r square".  So, map in hand<br/>
we were off to scout out the area and were planning to come back the<br/>
next day, but once there decided to go for it, thinking we had just<br/>
enough time.  <br/>
<br/>
After a couple of false starts and asking around where the bike trail<br/>
was, I turned to Fly Doc and asked what the directions said.  Well he<br/>
didn't know because I was the one who had the instructions, well uh,<br/>
no, I didn't have them I thought HE had them.  Ok, so after dashing<br/>
back to the car Fly Doc came puffing back to me, directions in hand. <br/>
We lost some time but we can still do it!  Off we go, down the wrong<br/>
trail - at least we don't go far before realizing it.  Well,<br/>
eventually we do take a moment to closely read the directions and<br/>
follow them to the box that is well guarded by hungry mosquitos. <br/>
Hurriedly we stamp in trying to avoid the thirsty buggers. Fly Doc<br/>
re-planted and off we trotted.  We might get back in time. <br/>
<br/>
While we didn't actually face the "Wheels of Death" we were passed by<br/>
a man on a  bicycle who gave us a cheery "ching ching" on his bell<br/>
that took me back to my childhood which, in a way, IS reliving my<br/>
life.   <br/>
<br/>
We made it back in time, and were planning to get some boxing in<br/>
during the drive home the next day, after leaving son "Pi 'r square"<br/>
happily ensconced in his dorm room.  But our plans were thwarted by a<br/>
massive traffic jam on I-90 near Worcester, MA.  Up &amp; down hills, into<br/>
valleys and curling around hills: nothing but a packed grid of<br/>
creeping slow cars at least a mile ahead of us and a mile behind as<br/>
far as we could see.  And for no reason.  Then poof, everyone decided<br/>
to speed up and drive away!  A bunch of lemmings.  So, with doggie<br/>
waiting at home, we had to pass the boxes on by.<br/>
<br/>
I mention the traffic jam here because we've seen this before during<br/>
non-rush hour times, and wonder if it is a regular occurrence. <br/>
Anybody know?<br/>
