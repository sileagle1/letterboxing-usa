Glad to hear you like the scroll page graphics.  Feel free to use this page <br/>
for your own clues.  However, this particular page is not just one GIF <br/>
image... the best way to incorporate it is to copy the code for the entire <br/>
page and then modify it by replacing the text with your clues.  The code has <br/>
been written to pull the proper images from the LbNA site.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the most convenient page to use as a template is the "Submit Clues" <br/>
page at http://www.letterboxing.org/lbna/inform.htm<br/>
<br/>
In most browsers, you can right-click on the page to access a menu of choices <br/>
that includes "view page source" or something similar.  Then just copy and <br/>
paste the code into a blank text file, and save it with the extension HTM.  <br/>
(Text editors such as Notepad or Simple Text are perfect for working with <br/>
text files.)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, using your text editor (or your favorite webpage editor) delete the <br/>
original text and insert your clues.  You do not have to have the actual <br/>
images on your server for it to display properly... the graphics will be <br/>
pulled down from the LbNA site when you view your page.<br/>
<br/>

Wasn't sure if I was going to be able to follow those instructions; <br/>
due to my lack of web knowledge but bamm......  It work and looks <br/>
great now that my clues look the look time to get back placing some <br/>

Do not do this.  <br/>

Save these images to your server if you wish to use them (and you have <br/>
permission, as you evidently do).  Linking to images on a third party <br/>
server (in this case the provider for letterboxing.org), is bandwidth <br/>
theft, and in particular is explicitly against the AUP of the LbNA<br/>
provider.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for another "etiquette" post, but this is actually an important<br/>
issue on the 'net.  Prolly not a big deal if just you do this, but the <br/>
provider _will_ notice if lots of people start linking to images on <br/>
their server, and using their bandwidth (and its the principal of it ...)<br/>
<br/>

Well, if you say so.<br/>
<br/>
Steve, another option, and the one I've used when making "scroll" <br/>
pages, is to copy the graphics onto my own web site. I only did it <br/>
that way so that the pages would look right in my webpage editor.<br/>
<br/>
It's easy to grab all three of them: just go to one of the pages that <br/>
shows them and right-click over the graphic. Then click "save image" <br/>
and put it in a folder and give it a name.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps, Jay in CT<br/>

&gt;  What to do Mitch????????<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dear Steve (and others),<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad Randy spoke up about the fact that allowing hot-links to the LbNA <br/>
site is against the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) of our service provider.  I <br/>
was not involved in setting up this service, so was not aware of this <br/>
restriction.  Please ignore my previous advice: do NOT link directly to <br/>
graphics on the LbNA site.  I will be changing the code of the Submit Clues <br/>
page to include relative links, so that this will no longer be possible as <br/>
described in my earlier posting.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, I have set up my own accounts for the specific purpose of <br/>
sharing my artwork with others, and am not restricted by these limitations on <br/>
these accounts.  The bandwidth is mine; I have pre-paid for its use.  You are <br/>
not a thief to use it with my permission.  Therefore, if you wish to use the <br/>
scrolling page, you may perform the same routine described earlier, except <br/>
you should use the following URL as a template, rather than the LbNA Submit <br/>
Clues page:<br/>
<br/>
http://members.aol.com/letterboxr/scroll/page.htm<br/>
<br/>
Please note that I am NOT giving permission to use this template or these <br/>
graphics for ANY purpose other than posting letterbox clues. DO NOT use this <br/>
design for your homepage or anything else besides letterboxing clues that are <br/>
intended to be linked to the Lettterboxing North America website.  Although I <br/>
did NOT previously specify as such, you also have my permission to copy the <br/>
graphics to your own server, as Jay describes, although this practice is also <br/>
restricted to the sole purpose of creating clue pages that are to be linked <br/>
to the LbNA site.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
 -- Mitch<br/>
