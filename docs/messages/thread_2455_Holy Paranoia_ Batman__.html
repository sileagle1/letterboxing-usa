                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow! I was going to stay out of this, and be content<br/>
to be amused by the controversy, but I can't pass up<br/>
the quote below.<br/>
<br/>
"I hear what you're saying and finally here's my<br/>
prediction:  A few of you will have their lives<br/>
destroyed and the rest duck into the shadows and will<br/>
abandon them like wounded comrades on the battlefield.<br/>
 I'm not pushing fear.  I'm talking about<br/>
responsibility and compassion."<br/>
<br/>
I sure don't want my life DESTROYED, so I resolve to<br/>
never create, invent, inspire or share my ideas.  How<br/>
can I possibly foresee all of the potential<br/>
liabilities I will assume from people using my<br/>
newly-born ideas to hurt themselves?  I will keep them<br/>
to myself, and if we all try hard enough, we can<br/>
devolve, only thinking and doing the things we thought<br/>
and did yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to re-explain yourself.  I see where<br/>
you're coming from.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  We almost got washed out to sea looking for<br/>
Thunderhole this weekend!!  Thanks Tom Cooch for a<br/>
great adventure!!<br/>
