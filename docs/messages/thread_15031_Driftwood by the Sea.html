They are currently at Lake Shasta letterboxing, boating and hanging out with our new grandson Carson (the C of SPCA). Scott is a truly gifted artist and for more of his stamps check out other LBs in the Cambria area and in the Kernville/ Wofford Heights area. Both Pam &amp; Scott will probably be a little busy to hit the Oct. 4 get together but I will let them know about it. We are planning to have a Kernville get together in April 2004 so stay tuned.
