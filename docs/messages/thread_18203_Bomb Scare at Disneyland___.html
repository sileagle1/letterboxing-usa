Bomb scare at Disneyland a false alarm<br/>
<br/>
The Tomorrowland area of Disneyland opened 30 minutes late this morning after a park landscaper found a suspicious package at the bathrooms near the Autopia ride.<br/>
<br/>
The Orange County sheriff's bomb squad declared the incident a false alarm after deploying a robot equipped with an X-ray that determined the object was not an explosive.<br/>
<br/>
"We don't know whether it was an elaborate hoax or just something left behind," said John Nicoletti, Anaheim city spokesman, who was at the scene.<br/>
<br/>
The incident did not delay Disneyland's scheduled 9 a.m. opening, but patrons were unable to visit such Tomorrowland attractions as Club Buzz, Innoventions and Starcade until 9:30 a.m.<br/>
<br/>
Officials said that the landscaper found the object around 7 a.m. at the bottom of a staircase. He notified security personnel, who in turn called police. Police summoned the bomb squad.<br/>

What does this have to do with letterboxing, you may ask?  The story doesn't reveal this as they may not have known at the time but the package the landscaper found was a geocache inside of a hollowed out toy cell phone that had been in that location since Oct. of 2002.<br/>
<br/>
There being some similarities between geocaching and letterboxing (i.e. hiding things and trying to be sneaky about retrieving and replacing them), I thought it might be of interest and serve as a heads up for the hightened sense of fear that people have these days.<br/>
<br/>
We need to keep this in mind as we choose locations for our letterboxes.<br/>
