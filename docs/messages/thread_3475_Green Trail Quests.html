<p align="justify">What and Where are Green Trail Quests?</p>
</u><p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">Green Trail Quests were created in coastal Rhode Island in the 
spring of 1999. They are coordinated by the Salt Ponds Coalition who created the 
Southern Rhode Island Green Trail in 1997. The Green Trail is a 60-mile 
autoroute that connects most of the wildlife refuges, state forests, parks and 
other public open space in southern Rhode Island. It provides visitors with a 
recreation alternative to our over-crowded ocean beaches and coastal salt 
ponds.</p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p>Six quests are in place in Charlestown 
and South Kingstown, RI. In September of 2000 the Coalition and the National 
Park Service created another quest on the campus of Univ. of RI for the 
enjoyment of participants in the RI Greenways Congress. Several more are in 
various stages of development. The Charlestown Chamber of Commerce has 
designated an area of racks at their Tourist Information Center, across 
from Ninigret Park, as <i>Quest Central. </i> Quests can be educational, 
historical, promotional or just plain fun. </p>
<p>The seven partners currently involved 
with the salt Ponds Coalition in Green Trail Quests are the Charlestown Chamber 
of Commerce, the Cross’ Mills Public Library, the Friends of Rhode Island 
National Wildlife Refuges, the National Park Service, the South Kingstown Land 
Trust, the South County Tourism Council and the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife 
Service. Several of our quests are attached. We look forward to seeing you on a 
Green Trail Quest soon.</p>

I had heard that the Walk-About at Frosty Drew Quest was MIA.  Has it <br/>
been replaced?<br/>
