<div>Today was a great day for Letterboxing!  The 
Northwest was having a wind storm (102 MPH at White Pass) but there was no 
rain.  Went out to Priest Point Park to see what I could find.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The 7Nail's 'Nail Family Fun and Games Series' boxes 
were great!  42, Farkle, and Nail'em made a good excursion thru the 
park.  Good job!  Much better in a bigger park than Burfoot.  
Oregon's loss is Washington's gain!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While at Farkle, a guy I had passed on the trail came by 
while I was stamping in.  Told him 'Letterboxing'.  When he looked 
puzzled told him what it was all about and showed him what I was 
doing.  He sounded very interested, said he was tired of sitting in his 
apartment and wanted to get out.  Gave them the LB website (a great 
website, imho).  Hopefully see him on the trail again.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The World's Crabbiest Hitch Hiker was found playing a few 
hands of Nail'em.  Looking hungry, invited her along for some more 
Dungeness!  Sounded like a nice thing to do.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My mom and aunt played Farkle with some friends, wanted to 
share the great game with EskieLover and I.  Unfortunately, they remembered 
most of the rules but only a small part of the scoring table.  Looks like a 
great game, if you had all the rules and right scoring table.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was still early, so tackled the Lost Loon LBs.  
Typical Trial &amp; Error clues: they are very accurate, but lack a bit in their 
precision.  There were many locations that 'sort of fit' the clues, didn't 
guess the right one first, or second or third or ....  The ducks were 
enjoying the windy weather!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Picked up GEMS from GEM's at Lost Loon #2, moved them 
closer to civilization.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While at the park, checked on First Thanksgiving.  
Still there!  Water in the box, the zip lock was not zipped, but no water 
got into the log book :-)  Dried it out best I could, zipped the bag, it is 
there awaiting the next Nail attack.  (if you want to engage a Letterboxing 
Guide, let me know :-)  This was EskieLover's and my first LB find (second 
try).  She wandered around the tree, looked, poked, prodded, and was 
getting frustrated.  I just watched, looking around the tree.  I 
figured out where it probably was, and it sure enough was!  I held it up 
and asked her 'Would it look something like this?'  She got to do her first 
Happy Dance!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since the cloud's hadn't burst yet, headed up to Burfoot 
Park to check out the boxes there.  Saw a Pileated Woodpecker; it at least 
looked like dvn2r ckr's stamp!  Found three great hitchhikers, shuffled 
them around a bit.  The stamps were great!  Happy Mom did a great job, 
Funny Car Bob looked like a Lego vehicle!  Hope to see more of your efforts 
soon.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was a great day of Letterboxing.  Several people 
on the trails, a number of good looking and friendly dogs, no rain, no falling 
branches!</div>
