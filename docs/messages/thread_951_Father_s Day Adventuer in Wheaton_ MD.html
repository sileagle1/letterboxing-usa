<div>Oh  how I love Father's Day. What other day of 
the year could I persuade, convince and otherwise force my family (wife and 
three teenagers) to go out on a hot and muggy Washington, DC day for a new 
adventure called Letterboxing. I decided not to wait until we had our own, home 
made stamp. We just used one of my wife's fancy envelope stamps. We 
traveled the 1:20 from Fredericksburg, VA to Wheaton, MD with a picnic lunch, 
stopping at Michael's on the way for a nice, Strathmore, 5.5"x8.5" sketch book 
to start our Letterbox stamp collecting. We realized on the way we had been 
collecting National Park stamps in our NPS "Passport" book for over 8 years. 
Everywhere we travel we look for Nat'l parks to add to our collection. I hope we 
will start doing the same for LB.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Wheaton Regional Park is a very pleasant 
place. Having the kids (even teenagers) read and follow Squirrel's 
excellent directions, we soon located the Railroad box. It was exciting to be 
the first to add our stamp and names to the log. A walk through the woods, 
following Squirrels poetic instructions brought us to the next box, Deer 
Hollow... Both boxes were dry inside despite having to pour off rain water 
collected in the lid.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for a wonderful day, I did catch some major 
flak from my 17 year old son, but deep down I think they all enjoyed it because 
we have a  history of family adventures and they never know where we will 
head for next (Dad is willing to try about anything)..... Maybe the girls 
will wear sneakers next time instead of sandals. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>They all decided they want to place a couple of 
boxes on Old Rag mountain, a wonderful 7.2 mile loop hike, with 3258 foot 
elevation summit, in the Shenandoah National Park.</div>
