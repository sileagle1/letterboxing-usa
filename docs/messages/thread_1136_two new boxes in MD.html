I guess I'm pretty impressed! It looks like you're averaging about <br/>
one box a day. That's even better than Jay Drew (who does hold down <br/>
three jobs at the same time.)<br/>
<br/>
However, I'd have to say that it will still be a little while before <br/>
VA/MD overtakes CT/RI as the Dartmoor of NA.<br/>

Don't you love contests like this! The letterboxers in your regions <br/>
sure do.<br/>

Lake Frank Turtle letterbox clue<br/>
Lake Bernard Frank<br/>
Silver Spring, Maryland<br/>
August 20, 2000<br/>
<br/>
Take Avery Road to Lake Frank. Park in the lot. Follow the trail down the hill to a fork in the road. Take the trail toward Nature Center following 5 LS blue blazes. 40 paces from the 5th blaze and the two trees with one trunk you will come to a fork in the trail. Take the center unmarked path downward to the lake. At the bottom of the trail you will see a stonewall on the left. The letterbox is under rocks on top of the wall back about 3 feet. <br/>

Dragonfly letterbox at Lake Frank<br/>
Lake Bernard Frank<br/>
Silver Spring, Maryland<br/>
August 20, 2000<br/>
<br/>
Take Avery Road to Lake Frank. Park in the lot. Take the trail down the hill to a fork in the road. Take the trail to the right and cross the dam. At the end of the fence on the right side look for a small trail to the right. Follow that down 24 paces to the first tree on the left. Look behind that tree under some rocks for the treasure you seek. <br/>

I agree, Tom, it may be a while before VA/MD catches up with CT/RI, <br/>
but I've got three ready to be placed in Virginia Beach....two at <br/>
First Landing State Park and one at Fort Story, the sight of the <br/>
original Cape Henry Lighthouse.  I'd like to somehow write being <br/>
there at 6 a.m., watching the sunrise over the Atlantic Ocean into <br/>
the clues, but that was just a bonus of my first visit there.  A <br/>
soccer tournament last weekend took up most of my time, but I was <br/>
able to hike about 4 miles of trail at First Landing, and one more <br/>
trip down should be all I need to finish the clues and plant the <br/>
boxes.  So, CT/RI, standby for some competition.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Kathy, I can't tell you how much we LOVED Fort Story when we lived in <br/>
Chesapeake, Virginia. What a perfect place for a letterbox! There is <br/>
also a terrific park across the street called "Seaside" or "Seashore" <br/>
or some such that has a magnificent walk along cedar swamps and would <br/>
bring us all the way along Lynnhaven Bay to the boardwalk at VaBeach. <br/>
The navy seals used to run through there and I was always in awe that <br/>
running around in that beautiful spot was their JOB. We used to <br/>
photograph dolphins body surfing in the waves as the pelicans lifted <br/>
rhythmically over the swells. Oooooooooo.......JayD<br/>
