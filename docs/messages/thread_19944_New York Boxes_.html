                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're going on our annual Labor Day weekend trip to a dude ranch in <br/>
New York.  It's in Warrensburg, NY on Sherman Lake.  These are the <br/>
directions we travel:<br/>
"New York State Thruway exit 24 at Albany.  Then Interstate 87 <br/>
(Northway) to exit 24."<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of some boxes either on the way or in the area?  We <br/>
pass by all of the exits to the Lake George area.  Thanks in advance.<br/>
It's hard to look on the website when I don't even know what county <br/>
to look in.  :o)<br/>

all the counties so you can see what is nearby.<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE planning boxing expeditions to new areas--be sure to check out<br/>
neighboring counties as well.  I  usually start with the county maps<br/>
(www.quickfacts.census.org) and mapquest.  There is something so rewarding<br/>
about  "finding" the location of boxes this way for me.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your vacation!<br/>

list. I know something about the Putnam Pond one (Ticonderoga), and<br/>
there are several others in Essex county as well. Looks like you<br/>
should have some fun, and those are great locations, not all that far<br/>
from Warrensburg. I see there are also some near Saratoga Springs and<br/>
Glans Falls, on your way up.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Hope you plant one near Warrensburg!<br/>
