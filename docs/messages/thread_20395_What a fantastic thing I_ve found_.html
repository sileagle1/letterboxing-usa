know, I read the post about the media thing :( ), and found the <br/>
website. This was probably 2 weeks ago, and I've probably snagged <br/>
about a dozen and a half letterboxes in my area thus far (Western <br/>
Mass). I've lived in this area for almost 20 years (nearly my whole <br/>
life, I'm 22) and I cant believe some of the areas I had no idea <br/>
existed. I'm now regularly making trips around the county to go <br/>
collect letterboxes :) Not only was I in need of the exercise, but <br/>
just the chance to have a reason to get outdoors and find some of <br/>
these incredible spots makes this really quite an activity. I want <br/>
to place a letter box, but I dont want to do it just for the sake of <br/>
placing one, I want to make it a truly interesting walk. I've made <br/>
sure to email every placer and let them know the condition of their <br/>
boxes, I know I'd like the same courtesy, and I always try to rehide <br/>
the box better than I found it (add a few rocks, maybe cover with a <br/>
little more debris :) ). I really wouldn't mind joining anyone for a <br/>
hike, if anyone feels like partnering up and finding something out <br/>
here in Western Mass, feel free to give me a shout, I'd love the <br/>
company.<br/>
<br/>
Simply happy to be letterboxing. :)<br/>
