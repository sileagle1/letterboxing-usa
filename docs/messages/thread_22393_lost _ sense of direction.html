Some are born with it but I found you can cultivate your sense <br/>
&gt; of direction. Some time, when you'd near the coast, close your eyes <br/>
and just <br/>
&gt; feel the pull of the water. When you're farther away, practice this <br/>
again. You <br/>
&gt; really can, if you listen to your inner "magnet", begin to feel<br/>
what <br/>
migrating <br/>
&gt; birds, whales and other animals must feel. One day, you'll be <br/>
somewhere and <br/>
&gt; just "know" which way is north. &gt; ~~Doublesaj &amp; Old Blue~~<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funny about the looking towards the ocean bit, for East and West. I<br/>
spent 17 of my early adult years in Santa Barbara CA where the ocean<br/>
is towards the South. (look it up if you don't believe me, it's true<br/>
and weird) So I never really was able to grasp directions until I<br/>
moved to another state. I am still not one of those people who can<br/>
just look at the sun and know right where I am but at least now I can<br/>
put a mental map in my head that has the two oceans in the right place<br/>
and the states inbetween line up.<br/>
