It was a toss-up whether to name this after the Mad River or "Those <br/>
Magnificent Men and their Flying Machines." As a fisherman, the river <br/>
won the day. The Mad River here gets too warm to support trout, like <br/>
it does in Urbana. I have caught some nice Smallmouth Bass just north <br/>
of the cache.<br/>
<br/>
Leave a parking lot in the Huffman Metropark as far south and east as <br/>
you can get.  Follow a GPS to N 39 degrees 48.219 minutes and W 84 <br/>
degrees, 5.302 minutes. There is a level trail all the way to the <br/>
cache/letterbox. There is a little broken, rocky ground. Watch your <br/>
ankles. Strollers and mountain bikes are possible but difficult <br/>
because of the trees across the path. The path does not appear to be <br/>
maintained by the park staff. If you get to a trash barrel you have <br/>
gone too far. <br/>
<br/>
The cache is equidistant to the parking at the north end of the park, <br/>
but without waders or a canoe it is a very cold wade in swift 3-foot <br/>
deep water to get to this cache from the north. From the south it is <br/>
a breeze up the long peninsula.  For more detail and hints see <br/>
placename GC26B1 on the www.geocache.com website.<br/>
<br/>
The cache/letterbox contains toys for boys and girls of all ages and <br/>
a MAD stamp! Have fun. If you are there in spring and see someone <br/>
wading the Mad with a fly rod, stop and ask if it is me. :)<br/>
