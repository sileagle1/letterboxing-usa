                    <div class="plaintext-content">Has anyone found the Marblehead Lighthouse box near Port Clinton, OH <br/>
recently? I last confirmed the box in late April of this year and <br/>
have not received word one way or the other since then.  Over the <br/>
weekend I received a couple different reports of not being able to <br/>
find the box. It has frequently been the case that people were <br/>
looking in the wrong spot for this one, so I am not ready to call it <br/>
missing yet, but I will not be able to confirm this for quite some <br/>
time. Just wondering if anyone else has found it of late. Thanks!<br/>
