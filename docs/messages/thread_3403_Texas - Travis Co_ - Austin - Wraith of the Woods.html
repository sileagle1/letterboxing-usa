A plea for help....<br/>
I desperately need your help. Let me explain: Just days ago while walking <br/>
through the woods, I stumbled upon a terrible evil I can hardly begin to <br/>
describe. Corrupting the woods, bending them to his wicked purposes, hating <br/>
all life that wanders his way -the Wraith of the Woods.<br/>
He caught me in his roots and threw me down, his gnarled oak fingers <br/>
reaching down to tear my skin, seeking to rip my heart from my chest, to <br/>
leave me dead among the bones at his feet. I struggled, lurching forward <br/>
into him and I saw his weakness - a hole in his armor of bark near his <br/>
roots, behind a large rock. Inside this small cleft, I saw his soul. The <br/>
tormented spirit of some ghastly murderer refused admittance even to hell <br/>
and thrust into the tree to spend eternity at the whim of the wind and the <br/>
teasing of the rain. Here before me was der Geist der stets verneint, <br/>
trapped in wood with a grasp only long enough to touch those unlucky enough <br/>
to pass beneath his shade.<br/>
But I fear his wickedness is spreading so I ask for your help! The <br/>
squirrels who've eaten his acorns have red eyes and evil intents. The birds <br/>
who roost in his limbs screech wrathfully and swoop to attack. Help me to <br/>
stamp out his curse!! For that is how I escaped, by reaching into his soul <br/>
and stamping it with my mark in defiance.<br/>
When I did, he recoiled, leaving his earthly prison momentarily, allowing <br/>
me to slip away down the slope, out of his grasp. When he returned moments <br/>
later, his power was diminished. He swung his limbs furiously but was <br/>
unable to reach me again. I am still shaken by my encounter but hope that <br/>
you might gather the courage to strike another blow against his spreading <br/>
corruption.<br/>
I would not come closer again but I did use my GPS receiver to take a <br/>
waypoint nearby. From this point you should be able to see him. N 30 <br/>
14.698' W 097 47.819'<br/>
I wish you luck.<br/>
