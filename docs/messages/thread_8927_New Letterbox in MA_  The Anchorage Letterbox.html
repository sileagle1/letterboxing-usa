THE ANCHORAGE LETTERBOX: Sandwich (Barnstable County)<br/>
<br/>
Placed on October 19, 2002 by The Yachtsman and Mary Manatee<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At the eastern end of the Cape Cod Canal in Sandwich, MA sits the <br/>
Sandwich Marina.  This marina provides a stopping off place for boats <br/>
heading west to Buzzards Bay, or heading east into Cape Cod Bay.  The <br/>
Anchorage Letterbox was placed in honor of all the boaters who have <br/>
stopped here for a short or long stay.  <br/>
<br/>
This is a very busy area for landlubbers also,  with two recreation <br/>
areas, The Bulkhead Recreation Area on the west side of the marina, <br/>
and the Sandcatcher Recreation Area on the eastern side.  Many <br/>
tourists visiting Cape Cod stop in here to see the beautiful views of <br/>
Cape Cod Bay.  The Coast Guard maintains a station here, there is a <br/>
fish processing plant located here, and the Canal Station power plant <br/>
looms over the site to the west.  <br/>
<br/>
To get as close as possible to The Anchorage Letterbox, park in the <br/>
lot at The Sandcatcher  Recreation Area.  This lot can be reached by <br/>
taking Tupper Road, either from its intersection with Route 6A at the <br/>
Sagamore/Sandwich border (just across from the entrance to the Shawme <br/>
Crowell State Forest), or from its eastern end where it once again <br/>
intersects Route 6A at a traffic light in the town of Sandwich.  If <br/>
approaching from the west, take Tupper Rd to Freezer Rd (which crosses <br/>
the railroad tracks).  Turn left onto Freezer Rd, right onto Ed <br/>
Moffitt Dr, and drive past the Sandwich Marina.  Continue to the Canal <br/>
Service Rd, and park in the lot at the end.  If approaching from <br/>
Sandwich, take Tupper Rd to Town Neck Rd, turn right, and proceed <br/>
until you reach Coast Guard Road.  Turn left onto Coast Guard Rd, and <br/>
proceed to the same Canal Service Rd.  The parking lot is next to the <br/>
Cape Cod Canal Visitor's Center, a seasonal center run by the U.S. <br/>
Army Corps of Engineers that highlights the building and history of <br/>
the canal.  It is open from mid-May to early in October.  <br/>
