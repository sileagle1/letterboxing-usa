Do you know who Margaret and Mary are?  Barbara is just a question of faith.<br/>
How's that for continuing the riddle?<br/>

New Jersey and unfamiliar with many of the sights and cities. But the <br/>
truth is, I'm just not very good with riddles. While I can out-google <br/>
anyone, I really don't even know where to start with this one. So, as <br/>
with most of these mystery boxes, I'll categorize it as unattainable. <br/>

He was trying to find out if the rock group "They Might Be Giants" was <br/>
