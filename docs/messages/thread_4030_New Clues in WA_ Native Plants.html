Native Plants Letterboxes (3)<br/>
Location: Tiger Mountain, Issaquah, WA (King County)<br/>
Terrain: Moderate, with a few short steep climbs<br/>
Clue difficulty: Easy<br/>
Time: about 2 hours<br/>
<br/>
Drive to Issaquah on I-90, and get off at exit 17, which is Front Street.  Coming from the west, take a right onto Front St.  Go through the center of town and follow Front St. until the intersection with 2nd Ave. SE.  There's a stoplight here.  Take a left onto 2nd Ave SE, and follow that past Issaquah High School.  Take a left onto SE Evans St.  Go up the hill, straight through the 4-way stop sign, past Clark Elementary School's playfield, and take a right to park next to some softball fields.<br/>
<br/>
Begin your quest by heading away from the softball fields, on the trail that's across Evans St.  This trail is very flat to begin with.  Notice a very rocky, steep path to your left.  Don't take it.  Keep going to the second right-hand trail that leads up the hill.  Follow this trail as it makes many switchbacks.  On a switchback that leads to your right, stop and notice two trees to the left side of the trail, along with a narrow path that leads down to the ravine.  One of the trees is dead.  Step around this tree to find box #1, Western Trillium.  After stamping in, keep going up the hill.  Once you're at the top of this climb, take a left and proceed down the rutted dirt road.  You'll pass the entrance for Big Tree Trail and Brink Trail on your left.  The sign for the trail directly across from this has been lost, but it's the Wetlands Trail and Adventure Trail.  Go through the wooden gate and wind around through low ferns and blackberry bushes.  When the trail forks, go to the right.    Soon you'll enter the forest, and pass an old carved sign reading  "Adventure Trail."  Follow this trail through the forest, among tall evergreens and stumps of old-growth trees.  The trail is fairly flat at first, and then begins to climb slowly.  Pass a huge old-growth stump on your right.  When the trail becomes steeper, look to your left for a big, mostly-dead tree covered with moss.  Directly across the trail from this tree is a small clearing.  Take 6 paces into the clearing and look under the fallen tree for box #2, Rock Clematis.  Proceed up the hill to continue your journey.  Soon, the trail finished its climb and begins to work back down the hill.  At the end of this trail, there's another wooden gate.  Watch out, it's usually very muddy here!  Continue by taking a right.  This trail is considerably wider than the previous one.  There's a small (sometimes dry) streambed on your left.  Look for a skinny stump on your left next to the trail, and directly across from this, a fallen tree with some orange pain on its end.  From this point, turn around and take 5 paces back up the trail.  Look behind the exposed roots of a stump to find box #3, Sitka Columbine.  To complete the hike, continue down the hill.  When faced with a choice of trails, take a left and rejoin the old railroad bed on which you began.  Take this trail behind the Issaquah High School athletic field, and cross the paved road.  At the second road (not paved) take a right to return to your car.  <br/>
Well Done!<br/>
