<br/>
I've gotten numerous missing/damage reports on my boxes in Manchester, <br/>
CT (the Nevermore series, the Daydream Believer series).  As they were <br/>
the first boxes I planted, they may not be in the best of hiding spots <br/>
and I'm sure that some of them are, in fact, missing.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to go pull them all tomorrow, but fear not!  They'll be back <br/>
soon.  I just have to re-carve and replenish and...  In otehr words, <br/>
I'm not retiring them, just fixing  them.<br/>
<br/>
I'll modify the clue on the LBNA site when I get home to my own <br/>
computer (at a family member's house right now).  Until then, don't <br/>
waste your time looking for these yet!<br/>
