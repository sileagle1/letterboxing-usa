This Sunday, November 17th, from 10 - 2 would probably not be the best time to do the Lil Rhody Runaround letterbox series at Burlingame State Park, Charlestown, RI.  That is when the annual Lil Rhody Runaround trail race will be taking place, and the parking area (same as for Fall Gathering) and Vin Gormley Trail will be flooded with well over a hundred runners and walkers and even one guy who runs dressed as a chicken!  <br/>
<br/>
This year should be interesting, as the race will be going clockwise in reverse of its usual direction, so please feel free to come and watch, and then maybe do some letterboxing afterwards.  For less crowded trails in the area you might check out North Camp, Falling Leaves, and Schoolhouse Pond, which has a brand new parking lot off Kings Factory Road.  Or, come and join us at the water stop on the north side just off Buckeye Brook Road, where the yellow blazed Vin Gormley Trail comes out of the woods.  We can always use an extra hand passing out water to those thirsty runners, and we will have our stamps along if anyone wants to exchange!<br/>
