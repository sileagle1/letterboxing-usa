In a not-so startling admission this morning, the elderly knight was <br/>
quoted as saying, "Ravenhurst, Rayvenhaus, Ash Raven, Brandon Lee, <br/>
Christopher Lee? Arrgggh! Who can tell them apart? Danged tricksy <br/>
lot: all of the corvus!" The ancient teacher swatted the air [and <br/>
this reporter] in attempt to rid himself of imaginary birds. "Get <br/>
them away from me! They are trying to steal my meds!"<br/>
<br/>
When confronted by a Weekly World News article that stated in part <br/>
that a 'Pandora' had beguiled certain northern acquaintances into the <br/>
pursuit of graven images, the perplexed pedagog stood (with aid of a <br/>
cane) and scratched his bald pate. "Not sure I remember rightly, but <br/>
if Pandy says she boxed someone at a rave, she did it! That gal has <br/>
gumption and a mean right hook... or was that Captain Hook? She <br/>
carved that hook and Tinkerbell, too. Always thought she looked a lot <br/>
like Tink, if you know what I mean. Pass me some more of them green <br/>
pills over there. That Neo guy says it will make me see the matrix <br/>
but all I see is stars." Further comments from Sir Balthazar were <br/>
unintellible and sounded much like snoring.<br/>

driven you to the, shall we say, edge.  I take no offense at the mis-thought<br/>
that perpetrated this scandal.  I am not, in the least, upset or emotionally<br/>
scared, hurt, crushed, warped or even, shall we say, damaged.  Team<br/>
Rayvenhaus, 'Those who's wings are black', [Editors Note: This editor and<br/>
his staff in no way support the claim that humans had wings, for, if they<br/>
did, then God would have intended them to fly.] offers their deepest<br/>
sympathies to the Elder Badger and assures him that Team Rayvenhaus, 'Those<br/>
who's wings are black', [Editors Note: It has come to this editors attention<br/>
that perhaps, God did intend man to fly, ergo, 'Planes' however, he did not<br/>
intend for them to wait forever in an airport, which indicates that man was<br/>
not intended to have wings, but to carry a big stick and speak in tongues.]<br/>
<br/>
Team Rayvenhaus, therefore, wishes to offer their deepest sympathies, and<br/>
hopes that this to shall pass and reminds him that every man is an island,<br/>
but only a few are the rock of that island.  We categorically take no<br/>
offense at the twist in the name.<br/>
<br/>
[Editors Note: We would also like to apologize to the Elderly Badger, The<br/>
Wisconsin Badgers, The Badgers Cricket Club and any other furry animal that<br/>
may, or may not have been, offended by this response.  We also would like to<br/>
assure everyone that at no time, were any badgers harmed in the making of<br/>
this report and that, wait a minute! Badgers?  Did someone say badgers?  We<br/>
don't need no steekin badg....... ACK!]<br/>
<br/>
[The publishers of this report would like to apologize to anyone and every<br/>
one for the parties responsible for the badgers slurs and want it to be<br/>
known that any and all parties involved have been sacked.]<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When the photographer and reporter from the Letterboxing Enquirer <br/>
finally caught up with Pandora, who had been followed home from the <br/>
hospital in order to obtain her address and they were quite certain <br/>
it was indeed Pandora of Googled when they saw the postal carrier <br/>
delivering what appeared to be letterboxes, a knock on the door <br/>
awakened an ailing pandora who denied all accusations that she had a <br/>
mean right hook, or had thereby every hit anyone that did not <br/>
completely deserve it.  When told that she was being said to be a <br/>
Tinkerbell look alike she instantly responded "I resemble that <br/>
remark.  Small and tiny I am not but a pixie I surely am!"  As to the <br/>
claim that she beguiled anyone into letterboxing pandora points out <br/>
that it was indeed Iron`Bear that forced her to climb her first <br/>
mountain and refused to let her come down until they found the box. <br/>
In regards to Team Rayenhaus and their current letterboxing <br/>
addiction, which seems to be escalating near the point of fevers <br/>
pandora swears that all she did was tell them it was fun!  Having <br/>
passed out at the door asking for more pain medication a Large man <br/>
appeared that carried pandora back to bed and attacked the <br/>
photographer that attempted to take her photo as she lay on the <br/>
ground.  That is one big bear of a Man.<br/>
