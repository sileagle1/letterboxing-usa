It IS!   I just hate when that happens.   And that it's part of the game <br/>
doesn't do a thing to comfort me!<br/>

Even harder when it's your first one!   As many boxes as I've lost (and it's <br/>
50% of what I've planted), at least I've been able to console myself that my <br/>
first plant is still there and fairly successful.<br/>

&gt; Let's face it, if you are losing half of the boxes you are hiding <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; shouldn't be hiding boxes at all. You give us all a bad name and <br/>
&gt; maybe you should take up another past time. When someone finds your <br/>

<br/>
It's one thing if careless boxers leave your box out in the open- <br/>
that has happened to all of us.  But with a ratio that high, I would <br/>
start to look for better hiding spots, deeper cover, &amp; better <br/>
camouflage.  Good luck &amp; don't give up!  <br/>

<br/>
Extremely course in his responses, but always well-meaning if you <br/>
read between the lines.<br/>
<br/>
With my limited exposure to Sir Green Dragon himself I think he's an <br/>
asset to letterboxing, even if I can't condone his blunt and often <br/>
harsh posts.<br/>
<br/>
So, DebBee, let me translate and, to the extent I can, soften the <br/>
message:<br/>
<br/>
There is little we can do about careless letterboxers finding our <br/>
boxes and failing to rehide them properly except continue to try to <br/>
educate them on why it is so important to rehide well.<br/>
<br/>
There is little we can do about animals that dig up our boxes or <br/>
pull them into the open except try to be aware of where we hide the <br/>
boxes in the first place and be sure not to include anything in the <br/>
boxes that might attract such critters.<br/>
<br/>
There is little we can do about non-letterboxers who just happen to <br/>
stumble upon one except do our absolute best to hide our boxes well <br/>
in the first place and perhaps not hide them in places that might be <br/>
obvious to non-letterboxers to look into.<br/>
<br/>
Boxes will go missing and "die".<br/>
<br/>
There is no official or unofficial study or survey that attempts to <br/>
figure out what percentage of boxes placed have been lost due to <br/>
these or other reasons beyond the placer willfully retiring the <br/>
box.  It's hard to say, then, what a reasonable attrition rate is.  <br/>
We strive to make it 0%, of course.<br/>
<br/>
However, what I believe alarmed Brian in the post was the statement <br/>
that 50% of boxes placed had been lost.  Despite the lack of some <br/>
study or evidence, this appears, on it's surface, to be a very high <br/>
attrition rate.  Although it's entirely possible that all of those <br/>
boxes have been lost due to careless finders, animals, or accidental <br/>
finds by non-letterboxes.  As another poster said, if the number of <br/>
boxes placed was low -- say 4, and thus the number lost was also low <br/>
(2), then this is entirely plausible.  I do not know if you really <br/>
meant 50% or were using a bit of license.  I do not know if you've <br/>
listed all your boxes in the LbNA database, or if the ones that are <br/>
there are only the ones that survive.<br/>
<br/>
However, if of the 14 boxes you have listed, 7 of them are gone, it <br/>
might (and in my most diplomatic tone let me emphasize MIGHT) be <br/>
that the reason you are losing so many is that something about the <br/>
way your are placing your boxes is greatly increasing the likelihood <br/>
of their disappearance.  This could be any of the following:<br/>
1.  Using containers that are too big for the hiding space, thus <br/>
making it challenging to adequately hide the letterbox.<br/>
2.  Picking hiding places that are less than ideal for a box -- <br/>
hiding places that invite non-letterboxers to explore, for example, <br/>
or areas that are so highly trafficked that you unintentionally <br/>
invite non-letterboxers to find them.  Remember, gardeners, <br/>
landscapers, and maintenance men can be enemies to letterboxes too.<br/>
3.  Not fully hiding the boxes or leaving part of the box exposed.<br/>
<br/>
Other possibilities exist.<br/>
<br/>
This, I believe, is the point Brian was making in many fewer words <br/>
than I'm using now.  Make sure that the reason you are losing so <br/>
many boxes isn't you.<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
