as I have learned of 22 new places to go hike!!!  :-)     I grew up in a<br/>
town bordering Sherborn and now live in a second town bordering Sherborn.  I<br/>
had NO idea there was still so much open space available.    Much of it you<br/>
won't find unless you're looking for it, "parking" spots are often simply a<br/>
spot along a road with a tiny trail head hiding among trees and ground-cover<br/>
(aka poison ivy).    Thank you!!<br/>

Yesterday, I went and found a book called Sherborn Walks.   It's available<br/>
at Town Hall and Broadmoor Wildlife Sanctuary (or so says the Bay Path<br/>
Circuit website).   I got a copy at Broadmoor.    So, from that booklet,<br/>
here is a list of hikes in Sherborn.    I decided to ask about the most<br/>
obvious one (Rocky Narrows Reservation).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bailey Trail<br/>
<br/>
Barber Reservation<br/>
<br/>
Bogastow Trail<br/>
<br/>
Broadmoor Wildlife Sanctuary (entry to this is actually in Natick, only a<br/>
portion of this is in Sherborn)<br/>
<br/>
Brush Hill Trail<br/>
<br/>
Farm Pond<br/>
<br/>
Grandfather's Field<br/>
<br/>
Hildreth/Schoolhouse Trail<br/>
<br/>
Laurel Farm<br/>
<br/>
Leland Reservation<br/>
<br/>
Little Farm Pond<br/>
<br/>
MacGregor Quarry<br/>
<br/>
Peters Hill Trail<br/>
<br/>
Pine Hill Cemetary<br/>
<br/>
Pleasant Street Trail<br/>
<br/>
Rocky Narrows Reservation<br/>
<br/>
Sewall Brook Trail<br/>
<br/>
Sherborn Town Forest - Goulding St to Farm Rd<br/>
<br/>
Sherborn Town Forest - Farm Rd to Eliot St<br/>
<br/>
Sherborn Town Forest - Eliot St to Hunting Ln<br/>
<br/>
Ward Parks Road<br/>
<br/>
West Goulding St and Woodland St<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who is in this general area, I HIGHLY recommend this booklet ($12).<br/>
It's got beautiful maps of the hikes, and very interesting historical<br/>
information about the area, as well as cool stuff to see!   For instance,<br/>
there are carnivorous plants (growing naturally!) around the Little Farm<br/>
Pond area.    :-)<br/>

been thinking I might scoot on down to Sherborn to check it out! By <br/>
the time I come back from camping on Thursday the clues will be <br/>

Thanks for this list of spots. I will cut and paste.<br/>
