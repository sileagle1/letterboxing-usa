<br/>
How come Glenn can't play nice?  He's  promised numerous times that he<br/>
won't post to the list, yet he continues to.  What's up with that?  I'm<br/>
saddened by his behavior. He must be a very unhappy man to feel the need<br/>
to act the way he does.  Forgive my ignorance, but I just don't "get"<br/>
the sense of humor in his "jokes".  And the profanity seems so<br/>
inappropriate for a list that serves a family sport.<br/>
<br/>
Am I only causing more trouble by responding to such conduct?  Perhaps<br/>
he's like an immature child that thrives on negative attention because<br/>
it's better than nothing.  Am I getting as cynical as him?  I must say,<br/>
I'm beginning to find myself a very judmental person these days.  I've<br/>
come to believe that he and Tonya Harding give the Pacific NW a bad<br/>
name.  We're not all horrible here on the West Coast (though recent<br/>
posts may have everyone believing otherwise).<br/>
<br/>
Doctor, can you help me with an objective analysis of this situation?<br/>
<br/>

This man did not deserve the vitriolic and venemous rehashing of events that had nothing AT ALL to do with his simple question. If it is humanly possible for Glenn to do so, he should apologize to that man either off-list or publicly for not giving him what he asked for, but giving him far more than he deserved. I am truly appalled.
