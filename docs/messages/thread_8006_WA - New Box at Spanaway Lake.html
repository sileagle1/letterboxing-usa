                    <html><body><div>Spanaway Lake Letterbox<br/>Spanaway<br/>Pierce County<br/>Washington<br/><br/>Level of difficulty: Fairly easy, but not intentionally.....  Actually, there are dozens of confusing trails in the area where I hid the box, but after wandering around for a long time and finally hiding the box, I discovered that I was almost back where I started from!</div> <div><br/>This letterbox is inspired by the high school cross country runners that use this park for their races, including a sprint right through the creek!  The day I placed the box I was watching my daughter compete.  She took second place!<br/><br/>Directions: Spanaway Lake Park is operated by Pierce County Parks and Recreation.  The easiest way to approach it is from Highway 7. Turn west onto 152nd St. (Military Road),  then turn left into the park after about a mile.</div> <div> </div> <div>Spanaway Lake "Sunset Runner" clues:  <br/><br/>Park in the northern-most parking lot.  This is the area where the lake drains into Spanaway Creek.  Go past the barbecue area and over both bridges.  (The runners go over only the first bridge and double back through the creek)  Go approximately 150 degrees, which will take you up a hill and past some rotting logs.  Just past the logs, hang a right on a small trail.  Looking to your right, go past the continuation of one of the logs you already passed, and look on the back side of the second log.  </div> <div> </div> <div>Hide well when finished.  Judging by the assorted beverage debris, there is a fair amount of unsupervised activity in this area.  You can follow the same route back, or just wander the various trails and see where you come out!  Lots of fall color in some areas.</div> <div> </div> <div>Placed September 26, 2002 by Sun Seeker<br/><br/><br/><br/></div></body></html>
