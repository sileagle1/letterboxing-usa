&gt;It's been strange weather in Western New York lately. On Monday we <br/>
&gt;had school closings due to white-out conditions. Yesterday it was <br/>
&gt;seventy degrees out. Last week was cold, snowy and miserable. The <br/>
&gt;previous week was like this with temperature changes going from 30's <br/>
&gt;to 70's over the week. I was in Buffalo for a short while and made a <br/>
&gt;half-hearted attempt to find "Buffalo Wings" letterbox. I failed. I <br/>
&gt;had assumed that the Skinnerville Cemetary would be off Skinnerville <br/>
&gt;Road. It's not. I was at the wrong end of the Ellicott Creek Bike <br/>
&gt;Trail. Last week was miserable so I stayed home. Yesterday was so <br/>
&gt;gorgeous, I decided to give this letterboxing thing another try.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This time I started from Skinnerville Cemetary instead of <br/>
&gt;Skinnerville Road and quickly found "Buffalo Wings". If I had found <br/>
&gt;it on my first attempt, I could have deflowered a virgin <br/>
&gt;box! 'Jellybean' braved the winter weather and found it last Sunday. <br/>
&gt;I logged my find, replaced the box, then got in my car and hit the <br/>
&gt;thruway. Forty-five minutes later I was in East Aurora searching <br/>
&gt;for "Sinking Ponds". Sinking Ponds Wildlife Sanctuary is just <br/>
&gt;outside of town, tucked away behind all the utility companies <br/>
&gt;properties. It's essentially a pond about four acres in size. The <br/>
&gt;main trail simply circles the pond. I was able to log my find in <br/>
&gt;complete privacy. I could tell at a glance that I was alone in the <br/>
&gt;sanctuary. I found the box under the rock, under the leaves, under <br/>
&gt;two inches of snow, under a layer of ice. I had to punch holes <br/>
&gt;through the ice and grope for the box. And 'Jellybean' had beaten me <br/>
&gt;again! :D (Unlike "Buffalo Wings", it was not a virgin box) On the <br/>
&gt;way out, I signed in at the guestbook register and checked the most <br/>
&gt;recent couple of pages to see if any other letterboxers had been by. <br/>
&gt;This site is apparently geocacher's heaven! Maybe I'll get a GPS <br/>
&gt;unit for Christmas. :D<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wanted more, but there weren't any more boxes within a reasonable <br/>
&gt;driving distance. So, I headed for the Downtown Buffalo Library to <br/>
&gt;try and solve the Kimball Library Letterbook.  I've solved all the <br/>
&gt;clues and I've taken out all the necessary books. (No! I'm NOT going <br/>
&gt;to tell you which ones!) I should have it solved by the weekend. <br/>
&gt;Okay, I admit it. I'm hooked!<br/>
