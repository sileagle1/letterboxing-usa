we were able to donate $230 from the letterbox(another $92 from co-<br/>

Mom that's me was visiting my son &amp; family who lives in Woodstock, CT.   Of <br/>

We did visit the "We the people letter box "which I think is yours. <br/>

    Excallent job! We did realize you had that box, otherwise we <br/>
would have made a trip up and stamped it! Not sure if you saw the <br/>
post, but Heidi and I are walking in the Relay for Life on June 7th <br/>
in Montville and we're having a little meet and greet event-type <br/>
thingy, complete with a Relay Logo event stamp!  Hopefully you can <br/>
make it!  <br/>
