                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi folks.  Just wanted to report that The Yachtsman and I, along with<br/>
Tweety and Mr. Coon had a glorious day of letterboxing in southern RI<br/>
yesterday.  Visited The Drew Clan's "Wooden Carousel" series in<br/>
Westerly, and found both the Napatree Pt letterbox and the Watch Hill<br/>
letterbox in fine shape.  Wow was the area busy with people.  Little<br/>
Narragansett Bay had a gaggle of Brants and a few swans bobbing around<br/>
in the choppy water.  We also finally found the Great Gathering stamp<br/>
(winter 2001) now that the ground is unfrozen.  Nobody had visited<br/>
since April of 2002!  Finally stopped in at the Quonochontaug mystery box.<br/>
<br/>
Also wanted to tell Team Greendragon that we loved their "No _ _ _ _<br/>
Sherlock" stamp which all four of us have visited sometime in the last<br/>
week.  On Saturday The Yachtsman and I also found the two "Meander to<br/>
the Marsh" boxes at Touisset marsh in good shape.  Altogether<br/>
wonderful to be back at letterboxing in the nice spring weather.<br/>
