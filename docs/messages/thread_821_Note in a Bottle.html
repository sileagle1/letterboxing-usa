<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; <br/>
 I read the story of a man who found a note written by Desert Pete.<br/>
 It was in a tin can tied to an old pump handle on a remote desert<br/>
 trail.<br/>
<br/>
  Dear Friend,<br/>
<br/>
  This pump is all right as of June 1932. I put a new sucker washer<br/>
  in it and it should last for at least five years. But the washer<br/>
  dries out and the pump has to be primed. So under the white rock to<br/>
  the north I've buried a bottle of water, out of the sun and corked<br/>
  up.<br/>
<br/>
  There's enough water in the bottle to prime the pump, but not if<br/>
  you take a drink first. Pour about one-fourth of the water and let<br/>
  it soak the leather washer. Then pour in the rest medium fast and<br/>
  pump like crazy. You'll get water.<br/>
<br/>
  This well has never run dry. Have some faith. Then, when you've<br/>
  pumped all the water you need, fill the bottle and put it back<br/>
  where you found it for the next feller who travels this path.<br/>
<br/>
  --Desert Pete<br/>
<br/>
 Like the next person who found that note, we need to be reminded to<br/>
 leave things in good order for those who will come after us. And<br/>
 that means paying attention to the instructions God left for us<br/>
 about integrity and effort. It means having faith that they'll<br/>
 produce a good result for us, that God will never fail us. Then we<br/>
 leave something for those who are going to be coming down the path<br/>
 after we're gone.<br/>
<br/>
 If you are grateful for what you were bequeathed as a citizen, or<br/>
 in your family, or at work, or in the Body of Christ, be unselfish<br/>
 enough to remember that others are yet to come after you. Leave<br/>
 something they can use to prime the pump.<br/>

****<br/>
Have you ever wondered about heaven and what the "entrance requirements" are? <br/>
There are many theories but you can find out for yourself what the Bible <br/>
says.  These are just a few passages that explain God's plan:<br/>
     Acts 2:36-41        Romans 10:17     Matt 10:32-33<br/>
     Romans 10:9-10   Acts 8:34-38        Acts 2:38     Romans 10:14+<br/>
     Matt 28:19-20       Mark 16:16          Acts 22:16<br/>
     1John 4:3             Matt 10:32           1 Peter 3:21<br/>
How do you do that? These passages are good examples of how:<br/>
      Acts 2:36-38;   Romans 6:1-5;  Ephesians 2:19;  Acts 16:29-33<br/>
Then: Eph 2:4-5;  2 Cor 5:14-17  &amp; Romans 8:12-14; Eph 4:16<br/>
On that last day you can claim your reward: Romans 8:18; Rev 2:10<br/>
