                    <html><body>Ok, I've stared at the picture for a long time.  I think I can name almost everyone.  My deepest apologies to those I get wrong or can't identify!!!<br/>
<br/>
Front row... starting with the child in the yellow shirt.<br/>
<br/>
Big Brother Frog of the Frog Family, Elvis, Newbe1 with his baby (sorry! can't remember baby's name!), D of DandShoo, red pants is me- Firefly, Bern of Celtic Pride<br/>
<br/>
Second Row... starting with woman in white scarf<br/>
Go Against the Flow (woman and man next to her.), Mama Frog, I think that's Mary from VA in the black coat (hard to see!), Aweehedgehog (I think!), Princess Turtle, Shoo, I can't tell who the two people are over my left shoulder, Schizokeet (headband), Squirrel (maroon coat) and Eileen of Celtic Pride(denim jacket)<br/>
<br/>
Back row.. starting with the guy in the grey sweatshirt.<br/>
Papa Frog, tall guy in white shirt is Elvis' dad, I think the woman in front of him is Tortoise, but I'm not sure, Tall guy in tan jacket is Darrin from CT, next to him is Psychomommy, I can't tell who the woman is next to her, I think you can see the top of Tammy of the ADG's head behind Shoo!  I'm not sure who the next two women are,  and that is the very talented Sarah of the ADG standing on a bench, TrekkerJo is right in front of Sarah's right shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
Phew!  Hope this helps!  If anyone else can identify the people I can't - please let us know!<br/>
