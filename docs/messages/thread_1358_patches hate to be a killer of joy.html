You have a good point, but I think it would be a lot of work for sombody
to oversee this. On the other hand, if sombody really needs to feed their
ego by the self agrandizment of inflating their letterboxing exploits,
who are we to be their conscience's policemen? They know they're fibbing....

What a hilarious idea! Maybe I'll order some merit patches and give <br/>
them to my mom to hold until I earn them! Your mom sounds like a neat <br/>

You know, the Valley Quest folks in Vermont require photocopies of <br/>
your stamps before they'll send you a patch (I believe the Mapsurfer <br/>
is the proud owner of one). And in Dartmoor you have to prove you've <br/>
found 100 letterboxes before you can get the latest updated <br/>
cluesheet "catalogues." So it's a great idea with a precedent.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I think here in the US it would be best to go on the honor <br/>
system. Now I've got to go get that Free East Timor sticker off my <br/>
car...<br/>

Yes I am, and I had to deal with the inconvenience of carrying a separate<br/>
stamp book for this purpose. :-) [BTW, they are very nice 4 color (IIRC) <br/>
patches, and are worth getting -- you need 21 VQ stamps].<br/>
<br/>
And all this seems to do is make it more difficult for the honest<br/>
people.  The person who wanted an unearned LbNA 100, even under a<br/>
verification procedure, could trivially fake the stamps of course; <br/>
who can do the verification of mapsurfer #24? and kin of its ilk :-)  <br/>
And of course, this person will never be able to show their book<br/>
at a gathering or to another letterboxer, so they are by definition <br/>
a lone letterboxer, so no one will see the patch and no one will <br/>
care.  If they want a patch for their own self-esteem, sell it to 'em.<br/>
<br/>
That said, the biggest objection I would have is the loss of mystique.<br/>
Stamps should be secret or shown at pub gatherings, not sent to some<br/>
third party verification person.  Some stamp images can even give<br/>
away the location of other boxes (either by accident or design ... :-))<br/>
<br/>
My $.02 anyway ... :-)<br/>

<div>I agree with Randy. When I first started this
