Bob and I spent a pleasant day fishing Trout Brook today and found <br/>
your letterbox.  Though frozen in, we were able to chip away at the <br/>
ice enough to loosen its hold. The box is in good condition. We were <br/>
only the 2nd to stamp in after Birkie Bob. We enjoyed the 'fishing' <br/>
as well as the brook and the hemlocks. We are planning to return soon <br/>
to explore more of the trails. <br/>
