                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow we turned on our computer, checked our email and had to call the fire dept. Every little plug in hole was spewing lava and fire was shooting out of the seams. This data base debate was very interesting getting it in about 10 digests all at the same time.  We have started adding an addition to the previous request that is on the bottom of our clues. The new request can be found on any of the three letterboxes we posted on "What's New" if you are interested. We do not subscribe, belong or feel kindly to any data base other than the LBNA site. We do not read them and even though some of our Letterboxes are listed we never check on the possibility that spoilers or other info could be listed. The information can not be of much use as it can not be current. We get notices from "Contact the Placer" and correct our clue sheets as needed. Data bases do not get this service they only hear from their members.  We do not get any requests from any data bases to up date their info so how can their status reports be accurate? They do not get up to date information unless the finder happens to post information on a letterbox the day they found it, but that info can be old by the next day or next hour. Only the placer, if they monitor their letterboxes, will have the most current info. Any other information service unless they get cooperation from a placer will not have accurate data .Any one using a "finders info service" without checking with a placer is just fooling themselves. Oh yes the LB trip to Ventura was successful, 4 planted &amp; 4 found.<br/>
