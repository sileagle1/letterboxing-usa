Well, he finally did it: on April 21st, 2008, Pete got his 10,000th letterbox find at Chuck's <br/>
"In Search of the Phantom Kangaroo" in Willington, CT!  (And, with of course no virtuals or <br/>
postals included in that count, he is only the second person in North American <br/>
letterboxing history ever to have achieved this special distinction!)  I was still off hiking in <br/>
the Southern Appalachians at the time, getting ready to celebrate "BABE" - the 10th <br/>
Birthday of American Boxing Event, for that first post-Smithsonian letterbox placed on <br/>
Max Patch along the Appalachian Trail on April 26th, 1998. However, I told Pete that we'd <br/>
have to have a little celebration for him when I got back, so now - in keeping with the <br/>
tradition I started two years ago, when I first reached F 10,000 at  Archimedes' Screw's <br/>
"Year of the Dog" on Cape Cod - the time has come for Pete's "Celebratory Swing"!  We <br/>
actually took it this afternoon after church at a nice new series by D &amp; B Hikers at Green <br/>
Hill Park in South Kingstown, RI, and decided to leave a little memento there under a low <br/>
rock in the wall behind the cedars, just a stone's throw from the swings where we <br/>
whooped it up in true swinging letterboxer  style!<br/>
<br/>
So, then, a week from tomorrow, starting around 6PM on Memorial Day Monday, May <br/>
26th, I'm planning a little party for Pete at our home in Charlestown, RI, pretty much like <br/>
the one we had for my 10K celebration a couple of years ago. We have a small house, so <br/>
we generally invite just a handful of friends in case of foul weather, but in fair weather we <br/>
can actually accommodate several dozen in our backyard, so hopefully anyone who feels <br/>
like making the trip can come to celebrate with Pete!  We especially hope to see some of <br/>
our long-time letterboxing friends, who have been so kind and supportive, LA-LA <br/>
recipients (see #127 on our webpage), and others who have given us so many wonderful <br/>
boxes to look for over the years! <br/>
<br/>
In order to allow plenty of time for those who might wish to letterbox during the day, we'll <br/>
probably start snacking around 6PM, with our usual baked ham and beans supper buffet, <br/>
lemonade, and cake shortly afterwards. Any additional salad, dessert or beverage <br/>
contributions would certainly be appreciated, but I think that Pete would be even more <br/>
surprised and delighted if anyone cared to carve him a stamp symbolic of his special <br/>
achievement - say, a commemorative kangaroo to signify all the hopping around he had to <br/>
do to find all those boxes leading up to that #10,000 "phantom kangaroo"!  Be it <br/>
kangaroos, "mr. sunshines", or whatever, hopefully we'll have at least one event stamp for <br/>
those who come to celebrate with Pete!  Thanks for being such a great letterboxing <br/>
community that has gotten us to this point in our collective North American history!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, <br/>
Wanda from RI<br/>

&gt; Well, he finally did it: on April 21st, 2008, Pete got his 10,000th letterbox find at <br/>
Chuck's <br/>
&gt; "In Search of the Phantom Kangaroo" in Willington, CT! (And, with of course no virtuals <br/>
or <br/>
&gt; postals included in that count, he is only the second person in North American <br/>
&gt; letterboxing history ever to have achieved this special distinction!) I was still off hiking <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; the Southern Appalachians at the time, getting ready to celebrate "BABE" - the 10th <br/>
&gt; Birthday of American Boxing Event, for that first post-Smithsonian letterbox placed on <br/>
&gt; Max Patch along the Appalachian Trail on April 26th, 1998. However, I told Pete that <br/>
we'd <br/>
&gt; have to have a little celebration for him when I got back, so now - in keeping with the <br/>
&gt; tradition I started two years ago, when I first reached F 10,000 at Archimedes' Screw's <br/>
&gt; "Year of the Dog" on Cape Cod - the time has come for Pete's "Celebratory Swing"! We <br/>
&gt; actually took it this afternoon after church at a nice new series by D &amp; B Hikers at Green <br/>
&gt; Hill Park in South Kingstown, RI, and decided to leave a little memento there under a low <br/>
&gt; rock in the wall behind the cedars, just a stone's throw from the swings where we <br/>
&gt; whooped it up in true swinging letterboxer style!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, then, a week from tomorrow, starting around 6PM on Memorial Day Monday, May <br/>
&gt; 26th, I'm planning a little party for Pete at our home in Charlestown, RI, pretty much like <br/>
&gt; the one we had for my 10K celebration a couple of years ago. We have a small house, so <br/>
&gt; we generally invite just a handful of friends in case of foul weather, but in fair weather <br/>
we <br/>
&gt; can actually accommodate several dozen in our backyard, so hopefully anyone who feels <br/>
&gt; like making the trip can come to celebrate with Pete! We especially hope to see some of <br/>
&gt; our long-time letterboxing friends, who have been so kind and supportive, LA-LA <br/>
&gt; recipients (see #127 on our webpage), and others who have given us so many wonderful <br/>
&gt; boxes to look for over the years! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In order to allow plenty of time for those who might wish to letterbox during the day, <br/>
we'll <br/>
&gt; probably start snacking around 6PM, with our usual baked ham and beans supper <br/>
buffet, <br/>
&gt; lemonade, and cake shortly afterwards. Any additional salad, dessert or beverage <br/>
&gt; contributions would certainly be appreciated, but I think that Pete would be even more <br/>
&gt; surprised and delighted if anyone cared to carve him a stamp symbolic of his special <br/>
&gt; achievement - say, a commemorative kangaroo to signify all the hopping around he had <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; do to find all those boxes leading up to that #10,000 "phantom kangaroo"! Be it <br/>
&gt; kangaroos, "mr. sunshines", or whatever, hopefully we'll have at least one event stamp <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; those who come to celebrate with Pete! Thanks for being such a great letterboxing <br/>
&gt; community that has gotten us to this point in our collective North American history!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
