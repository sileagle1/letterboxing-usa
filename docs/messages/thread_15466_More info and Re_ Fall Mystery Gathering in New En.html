<br/>
My tribe will joyfully welcome you at our gathering.  I have sent <br/>
you information for resting your weary band at your email account. <br/>
<br/>
We have been forced to retreat to a white man's lodge for the day.  <br/>
It is a strange sight for my brethren's eyes as it has a kitchen <br/>
lodge in the building.  It is a strange place filled with mystical <br/>
wonders - a fireplace for cooking that is a big white box but does <br/>
not use fire or smoke!  There is another white box that turns <br/>
everything put into it as cold as a winter's night!  I am not sure if <br/>
I dare eat food that has been enchanted in such a strange place but I <br/>
will try.  We welcome whatever drink or food you can provide us from <br/>
your bounty.<br/>
<br/>
When my tribe has met before we have been amazed by the bounty <br/>
offered by all journeyers.  I am sure that the food, the travellers <br/>
and the tribal carvings will once again be wonderful to behold.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard from sister Alafair that few have chosen to learn to <br/>
make the traditional tribal journals.  She fears that many will show <br/>
and want to do so but she will not have gathered the supplies to help <br/>
them.<br/>

&gt; It is not doubtful that the beetle and guests plan to gather with <br/>

interior.  <br/>
&gt; Might we contribute to the feastiness?  Non-fire waters perhaps?<br/>
