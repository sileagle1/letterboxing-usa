Valentine Letterbox (New England mystery box)<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing ordinary about Valentines Day! explained Randall to his <br/>
darling.  To rejoice this year, love, Ive hidden a valentine for you to <br/>
find.  After our hearty dinner of tender Nantucket scallops and saged duck, <br/>
well ride a ways up the main road, to the northwest, then head south at the <br/>
rocky hollow there near the pond.  Not far along, on the right near the <br/>
courts, is a lovely place for a picnicanother day. Id love for you to stop <br/>
in the southEAST cornertheres a fieldstone wall and a large tree.  Ive <br/>
tucked your Valentine low in the wall seven paces west of that tree.  <br/>
Replace it gently and we shall visit it for years to come.<br/>

SG, I got to the Valentine mystery site yesterday at 8:50am, needing <br/>
to be at work at 9:00, and had a hilarious laugh following Dan and <br/>
Melissa's footprints from the day before in the snow as they checked <br/>
7 paces from each large tree along that stone wall. It was a <br/>
priceless moment for me! Southeast, southwest, whats a few degrees of <br/>
compass among friends?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a great laugh,<br/>
<br/>
