                    <div class="plaintext-content">My kids are 6 and 8 and they're both able to handle the Speedball lino<br/>
cutters just fine--we haven't even had any good pokes yet! (Now mom, that's<br/>
another story, although it's more like "wearing the fingers to the bone"<br/>
when I get on a good carving jag...). <br/>
<br/>
I've recommended the PZCut rubber for "serious" carving, but one time I<br/>
ordered huge sheets of "grey stuff" (Soft-Kut) from Dick Blick thinking it<br/>
would be similar. It is too soft for doing fine detail work, but my kids<br/>
have great success with it for their own purposes. They usually make their<br/>
designs by inscribing lines to make a "negative" line drawing, rather than a<br/>
raised stamp image. It's about $8.00 (plus s/h) for a 12x18 sheet, which you<br/>
can easily cut down into a lot of 2x3 or 4x6 blocks for kids to work with.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who have fairly large groups and want an economical way to<br/>
get them started on stamp carving, Dick Blick offers a "soft cut" classroom<br/>
kit with 24 4x6 carving blocks, 24 handles, an assortedment of nibs, and a<br/>
tube of block printing ink. The list price is $77 for this assemblage, which<br/>
is a little over $3/kid if you've got that size of a group. You can also<br/>
order "parts" separately in the quantity you need--Dick Blick does have<br/>
really good prices if you need to order more than a couple of things (like,<br/>
$0.42 for basic calligraphy pen holders, a 12-pack of #1 liners for $14).<br/>
They're online at www.dickblick.com (I love the way their website offers<br/>
link suggestions along the lines of "if you're interested in this, you may<br/>
also be looking for <link/>. Makes it very easy to go from looking at carving<br/>
blocks to looking at ink or cutters.) Finally, they offer thinner sheets<br/>
that can be cut with scissors and mounted on wood blocks--similar to Kraft<br/>
foam stamps, but it looks like it's rubber and so should probably ink up a<br/>
little better. "Ccreate a stamp" is one way they package it, although it<br/>
looks like their "flexi-cut plates" are made of the same stuff, only larger.<br/>

&gt; How would  you work it in to summer bible<br/>
&gt; &gt; school or Sunday school class. How old do you think they should be <br/>
&gt; &gt; before they are allowed carving tools? I was thinking <br/>
&gt; &gt; 14-15....depending upon the child.<br/>
