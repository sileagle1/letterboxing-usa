No compass is needed for this box.<br/>
All the boxes in this series are easy to find.<br/>
The boxes in this series are Pennsylvania Wildlife.<br/>
All stamps are hand-carved.<br/>
You can find them all in the Allegheny National Forest.<br/>
I have tried to get people to some scenic locations with these.<br/>
The boxes in this series so far.....<br/>
Crayfish,<br/>
Spring Peeper,<br/>
Turkey Vulture,<br/>
Porcupine<br/>
<br/>
Box 3 - Porcupine<br/>
This Box should be easy to find, but harder to get to.<br/>
It involves climbing or sliding down a hill.<br/>
Most people should have no problem... but not everyone.<br/>
If you are a rock climber, bring a partner and your gear!<br/>
This is a great location for rock climbing!<br/>
<br/>
Directions....<br/>
Find these things and you will be successful:<br/>
Sheffield, Pennsylvania.<br/>
The road at the convienience store downtown.<br/>
State Road 2002.<br/>
Head West towards Cherry Grove.<br/>
    (if you come to a cross-roads with SR 2001 - "Vandergrift Corners",<br/>
     you have gone too far)<br/>
Drive 5.3 miles up the hill from Sheffield.<br/>
On your left is a logging road which heads back into the woods.<br/>
The Number of this road is 179.<br/>
This road goes WAY back into the woods.<br/>
Go back 3.3 miles on this road.<br/>
Arrive at a parking area on the right.<br/>
Park right in the middle of the parking area.<br/>
Head straight into the woods across the street from the parking area.<br/>
There should be a path that heads back into pine trees.<br/>
Pick your way down the slope.<br/>
DONT FALL OVER THE CLIFF!!!<br/>
Overlook Valley... Beautiful! Scary!<br/>
There should be a 45 degree slope somewhere to your left which goes <br/>
    between two cliffs. <br/>
Slide down the slope to the bottom of the cliffs.<br/>
Right at the bottom of the cliff is a huge rock  the size of a house.<br/>
Look for a diagonal fissure running through it.<br/>
There is a big dead beech tree forming a high bridge across to the top <br/>
    of the rock. (this might have fallen by the time you arrive...<br/>
    I hope not. It looks pretty cool.)<br/>
Under this rock is The PORCUPINE BOX.<br/>
Traverse the base of the rock.... head around the right side.<br/>
There is a sandy floor.<br/>
There is a crevice sheltered from the wind.<br/>
There is a slight overhang.<br/>
A dead log points to the way you came down the cliff.<br/>
Back in the tiny cave is the PORCUPINE BOX.<br/>
Watch out for real porcupines! If you search all the caves in the <br/>
    area, you will probably find one!<br/>
Take it out and stamp up!<br/>
<br/>
Box 4 - THE TURKEY VULTURE BOX -<br/>
(A bonus box)<br/>
Put the porcupine box away.<br/>
Stand up.<br/>
Face the cliff.<br/>
Somewhere in the rocks and logs to your left is the TURKEY VULTURE BOX.<br/>
It is about 15 feet from you. (give or take some feet).<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
