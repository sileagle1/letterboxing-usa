one" to our LA-LA list for 2006. Yes, it's our dear Bluebird of CT! <br/>
Even though she started letterboxing literally at the tail end of <br/>
2001, we feel that in spirit she belongs more with the CT "second <br/>
letterboxing wave" than with that "third CT wave" that didn't really <br/>
get rolling until the spring of 2002. So, to read about Bluebird and <br/>
our other LA-LA honorees for this year (including a couple more <br/>
surprises), please once again go to #127 on our index of plants at:  <br/>
http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner?Letterboxes.html <br/>
<br/>
We really do hope that people will take the time to read about these <br/>
early letterboxing benefactors, and to consider how letterboxing on <br/>
this continent now may be quite different - not necessarily better - <br/>
than it was back then. Some new people nowadays might mistakenly <br/>
think that North American letterboxing was built and developed by <br/>
folks who only came into the hobby on much later waves, or who only <br/>
planted a few boxes but grabbed more media attention. Many new <br/>
people probably don't even realize that letterboxing existed here <br/>
long before such "bells and whistles" as "log-ins", "contact the <br/>
placers", etc. were added, so we still consider them to be <br/>
innovations that have taken away much of the mystery and charm that <br/>
we enjoyed in the earlier days, when people went out to the boxes <br/>
themselves to check on who had been there, when, and with no mega-<br/>
lists or guarantees! So, please don't take it personally if some <br/>
people choose not to take part in some of the more recent <br/>
technological developments, but please try to honor the original <br/>
spirit of our letterboxing tradition and history, if you can! Thanks,<br/>
