                    <div class="plaintext-content">while saving a box from the floods in new hampshire, i stumbled across <br/>
a hitchiker which was in my damaged letterbox. i would like the owner <br/>
of Let's Ride the Skateboard to know that i have dried out the logbook <br/>
and will replant the HH back in B is for Billy located in concord, nh <br/>
as soon as the waters allow me to. while saving this box, i did <br/>
somehow manage to land a foot into the lake which my box lies near. my <br/>
box is repaired and ready to be replanted this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
i don't know who this HH belongs to because some of the stamps have <br/>
been washed away, along with the stamps on the first page. any help <br/>
would be appreciated.<br/>
