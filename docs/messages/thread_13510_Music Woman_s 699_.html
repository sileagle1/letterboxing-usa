                    <div class="plaintext-content">ummm.... I'm sure I'll get a stern talking to tomorrow when I meet Butterfly <br/>
and Stephanie for boxing.... however, I do a lot of boxing alone.  Don't get <br/>
me wrong, I do enjoy company when boxing, however, there are times when I like <br/>
to be alone, for various reasons!  However, I shouldn't be anyone's <br/>
inspiration.... I need a 12 step program!<br/>
<br/>
I also sometimes hike 10 miles in a day!  :-)  Then I'm zonked the next day!  <br/>
You should have seen me at school on Monday!  I was SO tired (and I even had <br/>
a delayed start to the school day due to no before school rehearsal!).... of <br/>
course, that didn't deter me from walking over four miles Monday afternoon to <br/>
finish what I forgot the day before!  My feet hurt today, so I mowed lawn in <br/>
sneakers instead of boxing.  Butterfly e-mailed me this morning, expecting me to <br/>
go out today and fix my uneven number... however I assured her that it <br/>
wouldn't be happening!  I did tell her though to make my first box tomorrow morning <br/>
extra special!  <br/>
<br/>
And for all of you who are wondering... how does she get to box during the <br/>
day????  I don't usually, however, tomorrow the entire school is at Field Day, <br/>
and I told them that if they had a nice morning in terms of weather, that they <br/>
could go to Field Day rather than lessons.  If it rained however, they were to <br/>
report to lessons!  I don't think its raining tomorrow until late <br/>
afternoon....  Of course, by then, the kids will be out of school for the day, since its <br/>
a half day!  Gotta love the last few days of school!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting everyone!<br/>
