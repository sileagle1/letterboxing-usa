                    <html><body>Cscm and I had a marathon boxing day on Sunday. It was a lovely day and we managed to get 6 boxes all told. 
<br/>
<br/>We started the day by seeking out the "Birdhouse Letterbox" in Needham. It took us a couple of tries to find the first "small birdhouse" but once we did...the magic began. All we can say is WOW! If you haven't sought out this box, you are missing out. I won't spoil it, but it is pure magic and wonder. Go find this box!!
<br/>
<br/>We then headed north to find the "Roadside Trails: Mt. Misery Box" in Lincoln. It is in fine shape in a lovely spot. There were so many folks out hiking with their dogs, we felt like spies trying to stamp in unnoticed.
<br/>
<br/>We followed this one up with the "Bridge in the Woods" box. Following the trails here was a bit dodgy, perhaps because of all the leaves obscuring the trail, but we ended up finding it despite a skinned shin on my part. The box was visible from a distance so we made sure to rehide it in its original hidey hole.
<br/>
<br/>"Gray's Reservation" box was also intact and in a lovely little spot. I wish there were more spots like this one set aside by towns and small land trusts.
<br/>
<br/>We then headed out for the "Apple for the Pie" in Stow. The directions were definitely describing child-size steps and paces and after walking too far, we found this beauty much closer than we thought. This box was also complete and intact but it was also exposed from its hiding place. We rehid it as best we could.
<br/>
<br/>Finally, we ended up at the other Stow box, "Happy Birthday Box". I felt rather bad that I think we scared off some other hikers (perhaps boxers?). Some folks were coming down the trail and stopped upon seeing us...probably looking a bit ominous in our orange vests (hey, it's hunting season!!) and they quickly turned tail and went the other way. So, if you were letterboxers and you read this, I'm sorry! We were only hunting boxes!
<br/>
<br/>Unfortunately, we ended the day by realizing we has locked the keys in the car. Many thanks to the nice lady who let us in to call the police...likewise to the police officer who came to our aid.
<br/>
<br/>All in all it was a good day. Happy Thanksgiving to All!!!
