There my sons and I were pleased by the hill and the view, tickled by <br/>
the stamp of the lazy letterboxer, and had their first exposure to the <br/>
ubiquitous wandaandpete, and impressed by the hand carved fern stamp of <br/>
andileo! So close to home, so interesting, and immediately addicted.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My family's first box was Baby Bear's Tejas in Mission Tejas State Park.  The<br/>
park is a favorite for my family and when I first read the clues I could<br/>
practically visualize the very place it was located.  We could scarcely<br/>
believe there would be a box just feet from the path we had taken many<br/>
times, so when we peeked over the log and brushed stuff away and discovered<br/>
it was indeed so, we were pretty awestruck!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mission Tejas SP is still one of my family's favorite camping places and it<br/>
is the park where we first introduced our son's cub scout den to<br/>
letterboxing a few years ago by planting temporary boxes in the park for<br/>
them to find.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My son is now a Boy Scout and I am going camping with his troop this weekend<br/>
to  you guessed it  Mission Tejas SP where I plan to break away and find<br/>
several more boxes that have popped up there in the last year.  Needless to<br/>
say, I plan to peek over that log yet again to make sure Baby Bear's box is<br/>
still in place.  And you know what?  I still get a charge out of finding it<br/>
there!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And my second box, by the way, was Silver Eagle's Spanish Flag box in the<br/>
same park<br/>

Huntington Beach pier (about six miles roundtrip).  They chose some great "landmarks" <br/>
like the swimmer standing on her head, and the naked surfer.  The boxes had handcarved, <br/>
very cute stamps.  What a fun day - wonderful memories!<br/>
