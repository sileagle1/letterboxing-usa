As a Letterboxer/Geocacher I have to admit that I love the <br/>
combination of two great past times into one.  However as HangGlider <br/>
pointed out, trade equal or trade up.  Just imagine what would happen <br/>
if everyone traded a fork for something cool- before long nothing <br/>
cool in the cache!  Back to Letterboxing...our family always carries <br/>
a personally carved family stamp with us when we go geo-caching (not <br/>
just hybrids) and we stamp into the cache log as if it were a <br/>
letterbox it, just seems more fun that way.<br/>

&gt; My Mom keeps the printout information sheet of our geo/letterboxing <br/>
hikes. She has made a special notebook for keeping track of all our <br/>
adventures. We stamp our own notebooks as well as the sheet. When we <br/>
get home the sheet goes into the notebook. <br/>
<br/>
Mom like to hike. So,letterboxing and/or geocaching is a great way to <br/>
get lizardbutt out. Dad loves gadgets, and is having fun with the GPS.<br/>

<p>I like to do the same with a stamp. I stamp all geocaches same as letterboxes. Most of my letterboxes is hybrids. I have had problems with 2 of them. I had a great geocache box only (before I changed it) an had loads of good items an it got down to nothin but a couple pieces of junk. The other box,a new cacher took my stamp. Ignoring the note to leave it. But..with all that,I sstill like the both worlds of caching an letterboxing.</p>
<p>Have a nice week.</p>
