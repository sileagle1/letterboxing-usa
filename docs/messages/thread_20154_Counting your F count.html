I was wondering how people count their "F" count. Obviously a regular <br/>
box is an "F", but what about travelers and HHs?? Do you count those <br/>
in your "F" count as well?? If not, how do you count them? I keep <br/>
track of everything seperately, but have been counting my regular Fs <br/>

********************************<br/>
<br/>
What Are PFX Counts and Other Abbreviations?<br/>
This question gets asked a ton. Please don't ask it on the talk list -- the<br/>
list is beyond burnt out on it :-).<br/>
P and F is simply a declaration of how many boxes the North American<br/>
letterboxer has Planted and Found -- it usually appears in one's e-mail<br/>
signature. For example, P83F220 means the letterboxer has hidden 83 boxes,<br/>
and found 220. "X" is the number of eXchanges made with other letterboxers,<br/>
usually exchanges of personal stamps. "E" is the number of Event stamps<br/>
collected by a letterboxer. Some people will also put other abbreviations in<br/>
their signature, if you are interested in what they mean, dumpster dive the<br/>
talk list archive, or ask the individual directly, please don't post this<br/>
question to the talk list.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, counting is not as easy as it first appears on the surface, and<br/>
sometimes people ask "how should I count this?". For example: 'What if I<br/>
find the box and the stamp isn't there?', or 'What if I find the box and it<br/>
contains a map to the stamp and I can't find the stamp?', or 'What if I<br/>
solve the clues via the Internet, but never visit the box?', and on and on.<br/>
As is done in Dartmoor, we have developed an LbNA patch to be awarded to<br/>
letterboxers when they reach particular numbers of North American finds, but<br/>
declaring accurate counts is on the honor system.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some guidelines on how to count, and while there is no rule-making<br/>
body for American letterboxing, these guidelines seem neutral and fair, if<br/>
you are in doubt:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxes planted in North America by any person, regardless of<br/>
letterboxing affiliation, count as Planted, and count as Found if Found as<br/>
below. No other objects can be counted as Found.<br/>
<br/>
Further, a letterbox can only count as Found when the letterboxer obtains a<br/>
stamp image from any stamp associated with that box, and their personal<br/>
stamp image has been imprinted (or attempted) in the logbook or other part<br/>
of the box.<br/>
<br/>
A box can be counted as Found more than once if the preceeding apply, and<br/>
its clue, location, and stamp image have all changed since Found the first<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
A box Planted cannot be Found by the person who Planted it.<br/>
<br/>
Hitchhikers count when initially planted by there creator, and count as<br/>
found when anyone else finds them. Hitchhikers are letterboxes like anything<br/>
else, therefore if their creator finds his own creation, he can't count it.<br/>
Now, with things like Geocaching, and the potential to put stamps in<br/>
geocaches, the question has also come up, in terms of P and F counting:<br/>
"what is a letterbox?". No compelling argument was made against counting<br/>
geocaches and the like that happened to contain stamps, in terms of P and F<br/>
numbers (although interesting ambiguities can arise), so they count for P<br/>
and F numbers. I think this quote from Todd Lane sums it up the best:<br/>
<br/>
If it has a notebook, a rubber stamp, and a set of clues it is a letterbox.<br/>
I dont think we should limit the type of clues deemed acceptable [...] or<br/>
demand that all "letterboxes" be listed on the LbNA page.<br/>

If you are talking about Postal Letterboxes, some count them and some don't.<br/>
I don't unless I have to solve clues to get them.<br/>
<br/>
If you mean personal travelers that some people carry, those would probably<br/>
fall under exchanges.<br/>
<br/>
Some people really like counting and classifying--I have seen some really<br/>
fun categories.  Others prefer to just find.  Many fall in between.  Find<br/>
your niche, count what you want and enjoy the hobby!<br/>

You found the HH in a letterbox, and you found the<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's Anjabanja and my thought on Personal Travelers, as posted on <br/>
our website:<br/>
Personal travelers are additional stamps carved by letterboxers <br/>
which are exchanged with other letterboxers at gatherings, on the <br/>
trail, or in other situations where letterboxers may meet.  <br/>
Normally, in order to obtain these stamps you must answer a question <br/>
posed by the letterboxer with the personal traveler.  The questions <br/>
tend to deal with personal information about the letterboxer or the <br/>
personal traveler.  Although attempting to guess or figure out what <br/>
the answer may be can be a fun challenge (and thus why finding the <br/>
answer allows you to count the personal traveler as a find in your <br/>
PFX count), Anjabanja and I feel that the spirit of a "find" (in the <br/>
letterbox sense) involves more than personal travelers offer.  <br/>
Currently we are including personal travelers "found" in our F <br/>
counts (as that is the general tradition) but have decided to list <br/>
them separately on this page in order to distinguish them from what <br/>
we consider true finds (proper letterboxes).<br/>
<br/>
At one gathering we went to we overheard someone say they don't <br/>
collect personal travelers.  We are personally leaning toward doing <br/>
the same, if only because in our opinion the "hunt" doesn't justify <br/>
the reward and besides, at events, there's so much exchanging going <br/>
on we barely have enough time for that.  I suppose it might be <br/>
different if we meet someone on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that's a really long answer to a simple question, so let me <br/>
answer simply.  Personal travelers are counted in your F count.  If <br/>
you want to keep track of them separately as well, that's your call.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Whether on the trail or at a gathering I consider obtaining an <br/>
individual's personal traveller stamp image to be comparable to an <br/>
exchange, in which you would obtain their signature stamp image -- <br/>
just a different stamp.  Therefore I include them in my "X" count.<br/>
<br/>
Since I am not aware of any personal traveller stamp that travels <br/>
with its own log book (although there quite possibly may be one), it <br/>
doesn't seem to qualify as an "F" even if the song and dance one <br/>
must perform to get the thing is complicated and akin to hiking up <br/>
the steep side of the largest mountain in Kansas.<br/>
<br/>
"F" is for letterboxes found -- a letterbox generally being defined <br/>
as a hidden box which you followed clues to find, and which obtains <br/>
a stamp and a log book, and with which you exchange stamp images.  <br/>
Technically if you locate a box and the stamp is missing, even <br/>
though you have found the box and may be able to stamp into the log <br/>
book, it is not a true find since you did not obtain a stamp image <br/>
from the box.  I know some people are loose on this and I guess I <br/>
can understand that since you followed the clues, did the hike, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I would however, disagree that a PLB should be an "F" since there <br/>
was no hike (unless you have a really long driveway) and there were <br/>
no clues to follow.  I wouldn't consider "figuring out how to get on <br/>
the list" comparable to a clue even if you had to pop a few kids to <br/>
qualify.  Back when postal letterboxes were unusual and sent <br/>
stealthily from one person to another, and it was rare to have one <br/>
show up in your mailbox even once in a year, I might have felt <br/>
differently.  But with the deluge of PLB these days, their <br/>
significance and stature has been severely diluted.  Counting PLB as <br/>
an "F" would in essence enable a person to reach F100 without ever <br/>
leaving their house -- does that sound like letterboxing to you?<br/>
<br/>
Same goes for virtual boxes in my mind -- they are a fun diversion <br/>
from real letterboxing.  They can be a great way to sharpen your <br/>
sleuthing and reasoning skills and to pass time during bad weather <br/>
(alternate bad weather idea -- carve stamps), but I don't consider <br/>
solving one to be an "F".  Some people keep track of them with their <br/>
own "V" designation, which is logical.  I just solve them for fun <br/>
and don't count them as anything.<br/>
<br/>
Of course there are exceptions to everything, most noteably HH.  <br/>
Heck I think I even counted the very first PLB I was sent and also <br/>
the (virtual) Kimball Library box in my "F" count.  So in <br/>
conclusion -- everyone is free to do it their own way and it doesn't <br/>
have to make sense to anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Its not like the numbers mean anything anyway.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, now I'm confused again.  I thought I had this down.  Music Woman said, "Exchanges are people's stamps that are stamped into boxes."  All this time I thought "exchanges" WERE the "regular stamps" or "personal stamps" or whatever that people exchange when they go to events or meet another 'boxer somewhere.  Ok...example here:  I went to a gathering and stamped my personal stamp in other people's logbooks, and they stamped their personal stamps in mine.  These were the same stamps we all use when we stamp into regular letterboxes. I thought those were considered "exchanges" (those exchanges we were doing)  Are you saying that those stamps that we "exchanged" were not "exchanges" but were "Fs" and are called Personal Travelers?  If as you say, "exchanges are people's stamps that are stamped into boxes", then one only gets exchanges by planting a box and eventually getting its logbook?  Some people there had only one personal stamp.  Others had a group one as well, and others had their son's stamp along, etc.  There was also one large event stamp for that particular event, and I assume the only time you could get that is by being there. <br/>
<br/>
 There were also boxes at that event which were made by people who were not necessarily there at the event, for instance there was the Cat that Ate the Canary box, or something like that.  I thought they were called Traveling Event boxes.  Is this wrong?  They had stamps and logbooks and we did with them what one does when one finds a regular letterbox--stamped in.  Someone there was either taking these boxes to another event or returning them to their creator, I don't know.  H-E-L-P  I'm not trying to be dense here.  I will go read the whole LbNA description again, but it seems to me there might be some semantic problems because people call them by different names?  Maybe I'm just tired. It's getting to the point where we need a whole letterboxing dictionary! <br/>
<br/>
It does make sense to me to count PLBs as a find when you receive one... the present popularity of them shouldn't change that.  Regular letterboxes were once a novelty too, and still are in some areas, and there are plenty of them whose clues are no more mysterious or challenging than signing up for a PLB. Well, hope someone can write this stuff in the form of a small dictionary of stamp and box types to help out the newbies as well as those of us who thought we had it down and don't!

Yes, those ARE exchanges.  However, people ALSO have personal travelers which <br/>
are different than their regular stamp.  Personal Travelers are usually <br/>
considered finds.  They are boxes that we carry with us.<br/>

Those could be considered Traveling event boxes, or just boxes.  THey are <br/>
also finds.<br/>

That is correct.  Besides, if we didn't count every microbox that didn't have <br/>
a logbook in it as a find, our F counts would be MUCH lower here in CT.<br/>

I guess the difference is how you define a personal traveller and <br/>
whether it has a log book or not.  Every personal traveller I have <br/>
ever encountered has simply been a stamp that a person used for <br/>
doing an exchange (other than their regular signature stamp).  In <br/>
some cases I have had to answer a question or solve a riddle or jump <br/>
up and down with my eyes closed and say the ABC's backward, but <br/>
still they were just stamps -- never a log book.  Apparently in <br/>
other parts of the country from where I live, personal travellers <br/>
have their own log books and are basically the equivalent of a <br/>
letterbox, just that it is carried in somebody's pack instead of <br/>
hidden on a trail.  In that case, I can see where one might consider <br/>
it an "F".<br/>
<br/>
I am not trying to split hairs with anyone.  I just think it is very <br/>
confusing for newer list members when posts are made that are <br/>
contradictory to what is indicated in the LbNA FAQ -- where it <br/>
clearly defines an "F" as a letterbox which contains a stamp and a <br/>
logbook (and follow clues with the exception of HH).<br/>
