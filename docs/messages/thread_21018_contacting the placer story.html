Thus far, it has been my experience that most people use the "contact <br/>
the placer" function/option/button. Let it be known that this works, <br/>
and that most if not all responsible placers will get an email and <br/>
usually respond. Myself included.<br/>
<br/>
However, I recently got a phone call at my home address from the <br/>
local librarian at the Bangor Public Library. I do indeed have a box <br/>
at this location and the librarian contacted me personally in regards <br/>
to a frustrated caller who had contacted the library to inquire about <br/>
that box and many others in the area. I spoke with the librarian who <br/>
was happy to answer those questions, but felt as though they needed <br/>
to be directed to me.<br/>
<br/>
I emplore all folks on this list who plan out of state vacations and <br/>
letterboxing trips to do some research into the area. Maine is known <br/>
for it's boxes being more difficult to find. I don't need to go into <br/>
details about how many weekends I turn up empty handed time and time <br/>
again. My boxes were not intended to be the easiest possible.<br/>
<br/>
Head scratching and perhaps some more investigation is required.<br/>
<br/>
Word to the wise, if there is a HINT (in large letters) contained <br/>
within the lid of a letterbox, then take it as that. All hints in <br/>
future will remain word of mouth and not placed in boxes of mine if <br/>
people can't respect this.<br/>
<br/>
I urge the person whom this email is directed towards to contact me <br/>
as soon as possible. I remain open to discussion and thoughts as to <br/>
how to make this contacting the placer option work better, but it is <br/>
only as efficient as the people who go out to FIND boxes make it as <br/>
such. Use the button, send an email and find out ahead of time. Doing <br/>
a little bit of research ahead of time can save yourself a lot of <br/>
frustration in the long run.<br/>

I have to say that this summer I received several rather angry emails<br/>
from people who came to MDI to letterbox and could not find mine. I<br/>
think asking for hints from a placer is an art and best done in the<br/>
best of moods! Sometimes I will respond and other times I won't (esp.<br/>
if I feel like the searcher is accusing  me of being a crappy<br/>
placer!!!) Generally, I don't give hints. My clues are not the hardest<br/>
in the world and the way I see it, if it was gauranteed you'd find<br/>
your box every time then letterboxing wouldn't be as exciting and fun<br/>
as it is.  I think I have NOT FOUND as many boxes here in Maine as I<br/>
have found. I think there are people who expect a line of chalk to a<br/>
box and it is these folks who need to relax and do a little research<br/>
first. Anyone who has searched for Legerdemaine (and Phyto) boxes<br/>
knows the excitement of researching, pondering, repondering,<br/>
re-researching, commisserating and crying out of frustration when the<br/>
pieces just don't fit...then one day just getting it. <br/>

That's it!<br/>

So....I went and checked on it. (It had only been out a week!) It was there!<br/>
And had been found by others! I wasted an hour or more of my time to confirm<br/>
it. I emailed the person to tell them it was there and if they needed hints<br/>
to email me back. Never heard from them again. No thank you...no<br/>
questions...nothing.<br/>
<br/>
It's common courtesy. If I get a response about my letterboxes...I try to<br/>
respond back to the person. If I find one....I use the Contact the Placer to<br/>
let them know it's safe and sound. I have emailed someone about one I<br/>
couldn't find. I really thought I was in the right spot. They never got back<br/>
to me. So...I'm not going to bother looking for it again. No big deal!<br/>

Love it! My favorite recent note said, "we didn't follow your <br/>
directions since we knew exactly where the box would be and it is <br/>
definitely missing. We really wish you would update your missing <br/>
boxes so we wouldn't waste our time on them."<br/>
<br/>
Until then, our favorite went something like "if you'll change your <br/>
clues to mention xyz, we'll stop hassling you about them."<br/>
<br/>
When we first started boxing, we were really surprised at how upset <br/>
people could get about not finding letterboxes. Now we understand <br/>
that it's just part of the passion and laugh about it. And share it <br/>
with you when the chance comes up. Neener, neener, neener.<br/>

Jay in CT, most of whose boxes are bright-yellow-chalk-mark explicit, <br/>
and most of whose contact the placer notes have been a delight.<br/>

<br/>
Waxing philosophic for a moment, one of the things that attracts my <br/>
clan to letterboxing is it's democratic nature - anyone can place <br/>
and anyone can look.<br/>
<br/>
The implicit challenge is that people of varying degrees of <br/>
aptitude and disposition will be attracted to both.  An enjoyable <br/>
experience connects many variables, and at core there is a placer <br/>
and a finder; it becomes easy to see how frustrations and <br/>
disagreements over protocol can arise.<br/>
<br/>
Given my experience in other internet-based communities, I suggest <br/>
it's key that the disagreeing opinions be expressed as <br/>
diplomatically as possible, without acrimony. Not all will cooperate <br/>
in being constructive members and contributors.  Ce la vie.  I've <br/>
seen otherwise awesome online communities falter due to the <br/>
persistent negative influence of a few.<br/>
<br/>
It's up to the rest of us to find ways to compensate.  Public <br/>
reviews and commentary on the letterboxes and finding experiences <br/>
might help; it would be great if people could post their experience <br/>
with different boxes at the site the clues are maintained (maybe I <br/>
missed something, we're still somewhat new to this). Like Amazon.com <br/>
does for book reviews.<br/>
<br/>
As far as feedback to placers - if it's not polite and friendly, I <br/>
see no reason for a need to reply.<br/>
<br/>
As far as irresponsible placers - there's no way to prevent <br/>
irresponible people (or just people who's approach we disagree with) <br/>
from placing and posting clues. So it's up to the rest of the <br/>
community to police through accurate, level-headed feedback on these <br/>
pubic sites, and for the sites to make mechanisms for that feedback <br/>
possible, including "last found" information and more detailed <br/>
difficulty ratings, both by the placer and by finders.<br/>
<br/>
I letterbox with my 9 year old; it is a family experience and a <br/>
teaching opportunity.  While we don't expect 100% success, the <br/>
hobby will certainly lose appeal for children if locations and clues <br/>
are consistently too difficult or up-to-date information isn't <br/>
maintained.  Since I suspect most of us want to see this wonderful <br/>
hobby perpetuated, it gives reason to behave in ways likely to do <br/>
so - basically, be a responible member of the letterboxing <br/>
community.  Rate your placements accurately, keep track of their <br/>
status and update the website.  If you can't meet those obligations, <br/>
don't place.  And if you have a pattern of abusing the privilege of <br/>
posting your placements on public sites, you should expect to be <br/>
banned from further posting.<br/>
<br/>
Again, the public, democratic nature of the letterboxing experience <br/>
dictates that the occassional whacko, jerk, or just someone with a <br/>
different or more extreme take on the activity than appeals to the <br/>
average partaker, is going to get involved, and the rest of the <br/>
community has to find ways to compensate.<br/>
<br/>
Just my $1.02 cents. ;-)<br/>

<br/>
I think if you would do some research you will find that this "last <br/>
found" information(database) has been hashed ,rehashed, and hashed <br/>
again. The majority of placers, at least those with sizable P <br/>
counts, think the idea stinks. The subject has caused intense flame <br/>
wars that from your text you wish to keep extinguished. Please read <br/>
through previous posts(see archives) before you subject us to <br/>
another round over this.<br/>

Not finding a letterbox can be a really great lesson in life. We <br/>
don't all get everything we want or look for. It makes success so <br/>

 Since I suspect most of us want to see this wonderful <br/>
&gt; hobby perpetuated, it gives reason to behave in ways likely to do <br/>
&gt; so - basically, be a responible member of the letterboxing <br/>
&gt; community.  Rate your placements accurately, keep track of their <br/>
&gt; status and update the website.  If you can't meet those <br/>
obligations, <br/>
&gt; don't place.  And if you have a pattern of abusing the privilege <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; posting your placements on public sites, you should expect to be <br/>
&gt; banned from further posting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me. Who will do the banning?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Again, the public, democratic nature of the letterboxing <br/>
experience <br/>
&gt; dictates that the occassional whacko, jerk, or just someone with a <br/>
&gt; different or more extreme take on the activity than appeals to the <br/>
&gt; average partaker, is going to get involved, and the rest of the <br/>
&gt; community has to find ways to compensate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our letterboxes are listed under "Don and Gwen", anyone is free to <br/>
search or not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my $1.02 cents. ;-)<br/>

&gt;&gt; I letterbox with my 9 year old; it is a family experience and a<br/>

&gt;&gt; hobby will certainly lose appeal for children if locations and<br/>
&gt; clues<br/>
&gt;&gt; are consistently too difficult or up-to-date information isn't<br/>
&gt;&gt; maintained.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not finding a letterbox can be a really great lesson in life. We<br/>
&gt; don't all get everything we want or look for. It makes success so<br/>

<br/>
One of my recent 'sweetest moments' was right in this vein. My 7 year <br/>
old daughter and I were out LBing at a lake we'd never been to. The <br/>
trail was sometimes difficult to find and very slippery with ice and <br/>
leaves. I was sure we'd missed the box and, as I looked at the clues <br/>
*again*, mildly said "This is a little frustrating." My daughter piped <br/>
up, "Yeah, but it's about the hike, right? And this place is so pretty. <br/>
If we can't find the box today, that means we have to come back and see <br/>
how pretty it is when the trees have their leaves, too. And maybe I can <br/>
swim then."<br/>
<br/>
Talk about melting your heart *and* being proud that the kid 'gets <br/>
it'......<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong - we often choose clues that seem doable for someone <br/>
her age, but even so, we dont' find everything. The very first time we <br/>
went out, we walked most of an afternoon and never found the box we <br/>
were after. Her little legs and my bad knee were not happy, but we had <br/>
fun. We talked a lot that day about how the box was kind of icing on <br/>
the cake and I guess it sunk in.<br/>
<br/>

irresponsible placers?<br/>
who is talking about irresponsible placers?<br/>
read the original post.<br/>
this is about an irresponsible and disrespectful seeker.<br/>
<br/>
you can't find every box. why on earth would you want to?<br/>
enjoy the search. enjoy the effort that goes into solving difficult<br/>
clues. enjoy letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
phyto happens to be one of the most responsible placers I know, and I<br/>
can't solve all of her clues. If you think that you can't find a box<br/>
when reading clues; then look for a different box.<br/>
<br/>
This is about respect. <br/>
Phyto deserves yours.<br/>
Libraries and Librarians also deserve your respect too.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of easy clues on the LBNA website.<br/>
There are also plenty of hard ones.<br/>
<br/>
Here's to intriguing clues!<br/>

First, it keeps people of all ages mentally challenged (some moreso <br/>

In truth the child is also a lucky one because she has a mom who is taking time with her and providing the example that has taught her to see the glass half full.  Too many in our world see the glass as half empty, and half empty usually makes us grumpy souls!<br/>

 Just what "flame" are you referring to? I've seen nothing but the <br/>
back and forth expression of ideas on this list in the longest time. <br/>
Perhaps you should check your definition of a flame. Just because <br/>
people don't agree 100% doesn't make it a flame. It's people who get <br/>
upset anytime that something they don't agree with is said that have <br/>
caused the most trouble on this list. Calling everything a "flame" <br/>
doesn't help one bit.<br/>
<br/>
 It would seem with the direction this list is taking now with all <br/>
the talk of mediocrity being the way to go. Many of the better, more <br/>
imaginative players of this game are going to be ostracized by those <br/>
looking for instant gratification. Is this a good thing? I think not.<br/>
<br/>
 There are plenty of clues and boxes to choose from. Pick ones that <br/>
fit your liking. Plant ones that will bring joy to you. That's all <br/>
the people that write difficult clues are doing. Playing the game <br/>
the way they want to play it. They are not asking you to join in, <br/>
although you are certainly welcome if you are up to the task. Just <br/>
don't go looking for a short cut when you have difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
 As for emailing the placers about finding their boxes, well some <br/>
folk would rather not hear about it. Again, this is up to them. I <br/>
myself like the surprise of seeing who has been there when I check <br/>
my box.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As Don pointed out, the whole notion of a database that tracks finds of a <br/>
particular letterbox is controversial and has been debated to death on this <br/>
list in the past. A primary reason that most experienced letterboxers are <br/>
opposed to it is that they don't want to deal with the issue of "false <br/>
negatives" -- a letterboxer can't find a box and reports it missing, when <br/>
in fact it was there all along if only the seeker had interpreted the clues <br/>
correctly. This happens all too frequently; and I'd even venture that it <br/>
happens more frequently than a planter "irresponsibly" hides a letterbox or <br/>
publishes a clue. It's symptomatic of a growing letterboxing community that <br/>
is less close-knit (by virtue of its size) than it was a year or two or <br/>
four ago, and that today more letterboxers start out without a full grasp <br/>
of the traditions and accepted practices of the activity (such as the need <br/>
to be able to read a compass or to be aware of the nuance of the "pace" vs. <br/>
"step" discussion).<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, there is already a tradition to report finds and <br/>
potential problems in public forums. In the past, this list was used for <br/>
reports of finds, but more and more this function has been relegated to the <br/>
regional letterboxing discussion groups instead. This makes sense, since <br/>
the regional groups have strong community connections and more interaction <br/>
between planters and finders in a particular region. As a result, if you <br/>
want to check the status of a box, you can post to the appropriate regional <br/>
group or search the message archives for any recent applicable messages. In <br/>
this way, there already exists a mechanism for determining if a box is <br/>
missing, in place, or if there are any problems with the clues.<br/>
<br/>
However, I think a more relevant topic is being missed -- that the onus for <br/>
collecting information before a particular letterbox quest isn't actually <br/>
the responsibility of the planter, but of the *finder." The planter hides <br/>
the box, then creates and publishes the clue. It's the planter's <br/>
prerogative about what to include in the clue, what not to include in the <br/>
clue, and how difficult or easy to make the clue. Beyond that, it's up to <br/>
the seeker to do any necessary prep work -- which might include any of the <br/>
following: getting a trail map of the park, determining the date of the <br/>
last successful find, knowing how to identify a particular species of tree, <br/>
figuring out how long the hike is, finding the starting location, knowing <br/>
what to bring in your pack (water, snacks, bug repellent, umbrella), <br/>
wearing sturdy hiking boots for a rocky trail, deciphering coded clues, <br/>
knowing how to use a compass, etc. The planter of a box may well give you <br/>
some of this information; other bits are mandatory expectations for anyone <br/>
hunting any letterbox; but in either case, it's an erroneous assumption <br/>
that this is ever the "responsibility" of the planter.<br/>
<br/>
I also take issue somewhat with any assumption that all letterboxing must <br/>
be appropriate for kids, and that it's a planter's responsibility to make <br/>
sure that their letterboxes or clues are "kid-friendly." There are <br/>
thousands of letterboxes on which youd never take a 9-year-old to find; <br/>
further, it's always the parents' responsibility to determine if a <br/>
particular letterbox is family-friendly or not. And if there's any doubt <br/>
whatsoever, why would you take a young child out on a letterbox quest that <br/>
might be too long or for a box that no one knows is still in place? Putting <br/>
the burden on the planter instead of the parent is just wrong, and I don't <br/>
think many letterboxers would disagree.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, the biggest problem with letterboxing isn't the small minority of <br/>
planters who hide "problem" letterboxes, but a growing group of finders who:<br/>
  * don't rehide boxes properly after finding them,<br/>
  * don't reseal the plastic bags after stamping in to a box,<br/>
  * don't use discretion when searching for a box,<br/>
  * don't do their homework before heading out to find a box,<br/>
  * don't supervise their children properly when letterboxing,<br/>
  * don't carry replacement baggies and paper towels to clean and restore <br/>
letterboxes they find,<br/>
  * don't make reports to the planters,<br/>
  * don't understand the "leave no trace" ethics,<br/>
  * don't take the time to understand how the hobby works (such as <br/>
hitchhiker etiquette),<br/>

Just thought I'd throw in my own two cents, since I've been mulling on <br/>
these ideas for a while now....<br/>

<br/>
I think Silent Doug makes several excellent points--i've been doing<br/>
this for less than a year, but all the same i'm astounded by the fact<br/>
that some finders think it's the placer's responsibility to do the<br/>
prepwork.  To me, part of the challenge of finding a box is precisely<br/>
that: doing the research beforehand.<br/>
<br/>
That aside, i want to propose a practical solution to one of the<br/>
issues Silent Doug raised.  (Note: i don't have much of an opinion<br/>
about whether there should be a database, as i don't feel i've been in<br/>
the community long enough to fully understand the controversy around<br/>
it.  Just want to make this clear here and now.)  And that is this:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; As Don pointed out, the whole notion of a database that tracks finds of a <br/>
&gt; particular letterbox is controversial and has been debated to death on this <br/>
&gt; list in the past. A primary reason that most experienced letterboxers are <br/>
&gt; opposed to it is that they don't want to deal with the issue of "false <br/>
&gt; negatives" -- a letterboxer can't find a box and reports it missing, when <br/>
&gt; in fact it was there all along if only the seeker had interpreted the clues <br/>
&gt; correctly. This happens all too frequently; and I'd even venture that it <br/>
&gt; happens more frequently than a planter "irresponsibly" hides a letterbox or <br/>
&gt; publishes a clue. <br/>
<br/>
If this is the primary problem with having such a database--and please<br/>
forgive me if this has already been suggested--then why not set it up<br/>
so that the database only lists the most recent find date for the box,<br/>
and only list it as missing if (and only if) the placer (or whoever<br/>
checks in on the box regularly) has determined that it's missing?<br/>
<br/>
Granted, doing a sort of "qualified missing statement" might be more<br/>
difficult than it sounds on a logistical level, but the first<br/>
half--only listing the most recent find date--seems like it should be<br/>
relatively easy to implement.<br/>

I agree with everything Doug has said. I would also like to add that<br/>
most placers include a disclaimer at the end of their clues<br/>
(letterboxing.org does one too) that reminds searchers it is up to<br/>
them to be sensitive to their surrooundings (for their own safety as<br/>
well as they safety of the land) as well as giving warnings about<br/>
boxing with kids and other general info (how long is a pace etc)<br/>
Perhaps there should also be a disclaimer that reminds searchers that<br/>
there is no guarantee of finding a box...that it is up to the searcher<br/>
to do their homework before stepping out in search of the box. <br/>
<br/>
And for the record, I think a database allowing others to comment on,<br/>
rate or catalog finds (a la Amazon.com) is a horrible idea. It takes<br/>
the fun and mystery out of the whole game. I personally don't care if<br/>
someone doesn't like my carving or finds my clues too hard. They are<br/>
more then welcome to comment on these things in my log book. (if they<br/>
can find it!)<br/>
<br/>
That said, I do like it when people email me about finding my box (or<br/>
not finding it if they think it is lost) and reporting the condition<br/>
of it as well as describing the hike or experience they had at its<br/>
location. I find this type of exchange so rewarding and helps to bring<br/>
the letterboxing community together.<br/>

 I agree to a point and just like you said, We do not have to<br/>
agree with every view point 100% BUT like in any game you do have a <br/>
set of rules and one of the rules in letterboxing is that if you <br/>
PLACE a box you will hear about it. If you do not like that<br/>
rule then you do have alot of other games to play. I am not trying to<br/>
sound harsh I am just trying to put into understanding that for<br/>
something to work it does have to have a core base set of rules<br/>
that should never be changed or no one will ever have fun.<br/>
<br/>
 If you don't want reply's to your box then you should state that<br/>
in your clue's to the box. I for one would not go looking for a box<br/>
with that added in the clues and I am sure that is why you are not <br/>
going to see that statment in clue's very much as I don't think to <br/>
many people would go looking for it. Letterboxing has always policed<br/>
it self very well and I hope we don't get away from that.<br/>

What's all this talk about rules, when I started this I was told that<br/>
the only rule is that there are no rules. OK, admittedly the concept<br/>
was passed person to person with all the implied "rules" but it was<br/>
assumed that you were intelligent and respectful enough to behave like<br/>
a reasonable adult. I think the problem is all the media exposure<br/>
bringing in stupid people. Face it, when this hobby was more<br/>
"underground" people only told other people that they felt were<br/>
reasonably intelligent like themselves and people that they liked to<br/>
associate with. Now any boob able to read is getting involved and<br/>
assuming rules and standards that don't exist and developing all sorts<br/>
of unfounded expectations based on reading one poorly written article.<br/>
Yes, I know many who find out about letterboxing that way do some<br/>
research and are intelligent enough not to make erroneous assumptions<br/>
but there are just as many who don't (witness the impetus for this<br/>
thread and the attention it's gotten). I'm willing to let these stupid<br/>
people make fools of themselves and give them a little time to figure<br/>
it out but I have no patients for people who feel entitled to make<br/>
letterboxing over the way they think the game should, nay MUST be<br/>
played and pronounce everyone else troublemakers or elitists for not<br/>
acquiescing to their demands.  And when did this turn into a hobby for<br/>
children. I don't think that was ever considered when this all started<br/>
up. It's only been recently that everyone began calling this a<br/>
"family" activity. It's great that those letterboxers with children<br/>
actually interact with them, unlike most parents today, but I don't<br/>
make my boxes for children. I don't have children and I don't know the<br/>
different endurance and tolerance levels for your 3 yr old versus your<br/>
6 yr old and I have no intention of adjusting my clue writing<br/>
accordingly because you've decided that this MUST be a family<br/>
activity. Didn't start that way, I wasn't introduced to it as such<br/>
and, as I said I was told, the only rule is that there are no rules.<br/>
Finally I would not be involved in this hobby were it not for the<br/>
interesting and challenging clues, I'm sick of the childish rhyming<br/>
clues and pathetic boxes hidden with no imagination, creativity, or<br/>
thought; just a piece of Tupperware flung along the road with an old<br/>
eraser that looks like it was gnawed on by a rodent or worse yet a<br/>
stamp purchased from aisle 5 of the local Michael's. I'm let down more<br/>
often by the dismal attempts to be clever than I am by a missing or<br/>
unfound box.<br/>

Given my experience in other internet-based communities, I suggest <br/>
it's key that the disagreeing opinions be expressed as <br/>
diplomatically as possible, without acrimony. Not all will cooperate <br/>
in being constructive members and contributors.  Ce la vie.  I've <br/>
seen otherwise awesome online communities falter due to the <br/>
persistent negative influence of a few.<br/>

When I started this hobby I was turned off by this list because it got off  <br/>
on a thread just like this one.  I went to another list.  When I came  back, <br/>
you guys were all sane once again.  I'm glad I came back:)  For  newcomers there <br/>
is an end to this negativity...I promise:)<br/>
<br/>
I was the one who mentioned taking my 9 yr. old out.  Let me mention  that I <br/>
am smart enough to choose boxes that don't require a BS degree.  Gee  whiz, I <br/>
think everyone just likes to be heard. (this is America after all)<br/>

It's a hobby everyone, enjoy it your way.  Wait, that sounded too much  like <br/>
the Burger King theme, sorry<br/>

Finally I would not be involved in this hobby were it not for the<br/>
interesting and challenging clues, I'm sick of the childish rhyming<br/>
clues and pathetic boxes hidden with no imagination, creativity, or<br/>
thought; just a piece of Tupperware flung along the road with an old<br/>
eraser that looks like it was gnawed on by a rodent or worse yet a<br/>
stamp purchased from aisle 5 of the local Michael's. I'm let down more<br/>
often by the dismal attempts to be clever than I am by a missing or<br/>
unfound box.<br/>
<br/>
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br/>
<br/>
OKaaaaay, I don't understand..........<br/>
<br/>
If you find some clues to be "childish" and you find some boxes to be <br/>
"pathetic," why are you going looking for those boxes?  Why not set out in search of <br/>
boxes whose clues you find "interesting and challenging"?  <br/>
<br/>
One thing that you said tho, I *do* agree with.  It would be nice if the <br/>
placer just included a short note about the stamp if the stamp is "store bought."  <br/>
I'm a fairly lousy carver -- and always will be -- and a lot of times I'll <br/>
put a note about that in my clues, so folks can kind of know what to expect.  I <br/>
can draw like nobody's business, but with carving, it just doesn't all come <br/>
together for me.  And never will.  There might even be boxers out there who <br/>
would *prefer* that I bought my stamps at a stamp store.  :-)  Tho I do think my <br/>
scarecrow stamp, my songbird stamp, and my Graue Mill stamp are pretty durn <br/>
good.  But, let's face it,  the rest are mediocre at best.<br/>
<br/>
When Keith &amp; I place a box, it's usually not really letterboxing for us.  We <br/>
place boxes at sites that have really meant something to us for one reason or <br/>
another and we'd like other folks to explore and experience the site.  So some <br/>
of our boxes we make incredibly simple just because we want folks to be able <br/>
to find the box relatively quickly, and then go explore whatever it was we <br/>
brought them to that site to see or do.  Rather as if the letterbox search was a <br/>
*reason* to get out and see that particular place.  <br/>
<br/>
But to us, the letterbox is not actually the object of the search at all.  <br/>
It's the waterfall, or the turkey farm, or the tall hill that Native Americans <br/>
used to use to signal trappers &amp; traders as they came down the river, etc.  <br/>
We're trying to put together a couple of "Limited Engagement Christmas boxes" to <br/>
place out near a cut-your-own-Christmas-tree farm because the farm also has <br/>
alpacas, emus, etc for the public to visit.  So yes, our clues may end up <br/>
"childish," and with my carving ability, the boxes might end up "pathetic", but our <br/>
"mission" is to try to get folks out to see alpacas and emus, not really to <br/>
find the boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
We just went searching for and found a box in Buffalo Grove, Lake County, IL. <br/>
 Being simple-minded, :-) , we originally set out to find the box because the <br/>
placer mentions, in the clues,  looking for a good creek and bridge from <br/>
which to play Pooh-sticks.  And, being fans of A.A.Milne, we were in a mood that <br/>
day to play Pooh-sticks.   I'm sure everybody else out for a walk or jog in <br/>
that forest preserve that day thought we were totally bonkers, but we had a <br/>
*great* time playing Pooh-sticks off that bridge.  <br/>
<br/>
We found the box in about 10 minutes.  We played Pooh-sticks for the next <br/>
hour, then we drove into near-by Long Grove, hit the Long Grove Confectionary <br/>
Company, and stuffed ourselves with some very tasty fudge.  And we both felt it <br/>
was a very "successful" trip up to Lake County.  I'm figuring it might be a box <br/>
that wouldn't be challenging enough for you, but for us, it was one of the <br/>
best finds we've had since arriving in Illinois.  A guy, a girl, Pooh-sticks, <br/>
and some fudge, on a beautiful day -- can't get much better than that.  Just <br/>
call us "simple-minded" I guess.   :-)   <br/>
<br/>
Another box we went to find one day was at the Clarke House in Chicago.  <br/>
(Great camouflage job on that box!)  The clues were very simple and <br/>
straightforward, and we went extremely early in the morning because we were afraid we <br/>
wouldn't be able to retrieve the box with a crowd of people around.  So we came back <br/>
at a later hour the next week and explored the architecture of the area, plus <br/>
took in a fantastic Vietnam Vet Art Museum, and stopped in the small cafe <br/>
there for some very good hot chocolate.  These were things we never would have <br/>
experienced if we hadn't gone looking for that box.  While the box itself isn't <br/>
"challenging," we considered the experience to be priceless.    <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Any stamp that someone has taken the time to hand<br/>
carve is worth finding in my book. In my opinion, one<br/>
does not need artistic skill whatsoever to take a hunk<br/>
of something and make it in to something beautiful.<br/>
The Sisters Act has a lot of new boxes in my area and<br/>
in each box is a very simple, very small hand carved<br/>
stamp. They're not spectacular with all kinds of <br/>
detail, they're unique, able to fit in their small<br/>
containers and in my opinion some of my favorite<br/>
finds!<br/>
Don't let the task overwhelm you! I often have to<br/>
remind myself: KISS (KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID!)<br/>
<br/>
The situation that Speedsquare brings up fits here. I<br/>
planted two boxes a few months ago in which I<br/>
mistakenly put the wrong directions for BOTH boxes<br/>
(bad direction day). GASP...sometimes, placers make<br/>
mistakes that they don't intend to! You will get a<br/>
much better response if you take a breath, pause, and<br/>
write a nice e-mail kindly informing the placer that<br/>
there might be some direction problems. The Christmas<br/>
Elves did this, and it confirmed what I suspected...I<br/>
don't know my left from right! They were so keen that<br/>
they found both boxes even with bum clues! Writing<br/>
nice, non-accusatory messages will almost always get a<br/>
good response. So I changed the clues and let Speed<br/>
know because I knew she was planning on going up there<br/>
to find them soon. This is called COURTESY. I know it<br/>
is a foreign concept to some, but hey...it has always<br/>
worked for me. <br/>
<br/>
We got some nice boxers in Indiana! We sure do! <br/>

 When things don't go someone's way they want to blame<br/>
something other than themselfs for the problems they <br/>

hours in meetings with parks to keep permits out and promote<br/>
the Letterboxer's as trustworthy people I would really hope <br/>
that I am not just speeking from the A-Hole but with a little <br/>
insight to letterboxing as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Also the point of rules I was talking about. Letterboxing.org<br/>
say's: <br/>
<br/>
The old cliche is that the only rule is that there are no rules. <br/>
That is true for the art of letterboxing in many senses, although <br/>
there is some common sense etiquette. <br/>
<br/>
 The term "old cliche" is in fact a rule in itself.  The word<br/>
cliche also means "A person or character whose behavior is <br/>
predictable or superficial"  I can e-mail 95% of the box placers<br/>
and they reply. That is "predictable" of how we are playing,<br/>
if the other 5% want to cry and treat letterboxers like spam then<br/>
you are not predictable nor do they have any etiquette. <br/>
<br/>
 Everyone does things different and I love it. Some even go<br/>
outside the lines and I love those too as long as they are<br/>
on this side of the planet :O). We have a few jerks but with <br/>
as many people playing it's hard not to have a few. I<br/>
am not saying anyone talking in this tread is a jerk so don't<br/>
blast me for that! I don't reply to this board much anymore<br/>
because of crap like this. Anything you say you have a few that<br/>
enjoy bashing and flamming people. <br/>

<br/>
If I have not found a box it never occurred to me that it was missing. Seriously, not until I started reading this thread did it occur to me that a box could possibly be missing. I just assumed I missed a clue or landmark or something.  No big deal, there are over 12,000 letterboxes, I'll find one.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is this whole conversation should end. It's going nowhere and it's a bore to read.<br/>
<br/>
I've been letterboxing for alittle over 2 years, love it, not going to stop no matter how hard the clues!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What's all this talk about rules, when I started this I was told that<br/>
&gt; the only rule is that there are no rules. OK, admittedly the concept<br/>
&gt; was passed person to person with all the implied "rules" but it was<br/>
&gt; assumed that you were intelligent and respectful enough to behave like<br/>
&gt; a reasonable adult. I think the problem is all the media exposure<br/>
&gt; bringing in stupid people. Face it, when this hobby was more<br/>
&gt; "underground" people only told other people that they felt were<br/>
&gt; reasonably intelligent like themselves and people that they liked to<br/>
&gt; associate with. Now any boob able to read is getting involved and<br/>
&gt; assuming rules and standards that don't exist and developing all sorts<br/>
&gt; of unfounded expectations based on reading one poorly written article.<br/>
&gt; Yes, I know many who find out about letterboxing that way do some<br/>

Hey, I'm just happy to find a hand-carved stamp! I'm not gonna grade <br/>
anybody on their work; it's just nice if you put out the effort.<br/>

Don't worry; the board will be back to normal soon.<br/>

Hi Somecomic, in my opinion any hand carved stamp is a great stamp! <br/>
Good luck with your box.<br/>

But seriously, I have so much respect for someone who can take the <br/>
time to carve a stamp, find a spot to hide the box(I cant even find <br/>
a good size box), and write the clues.<br/>
Ive been working on 4 boxes for almost 2 months now and I even dream <br/>
about planting them. Im having fun but sometimes I feel overwhelmed. <br/>
Im very happy with my stamps, but I do wonder if others will enjoy <br/>
them as well. but I guess it doesnt matter what others think of my <br/>
work. I just know I put a lot of work into it and im very satisified <br/>
with it. (that and im feeling a little batty today =}<br/>

&gt; "underground" people only told other people that they felt were<br/>
&gt; reasonably intelligent like themselves and people that they liked to<br/>
&gt; associate with. Now any boob able to read is getting involved and<br/>
&gt; assuming rules and standards that don't exist and developing all <br/>
sorts<br/>
&gt; of unfounded expectations based on reading one poorly written <br/>
article.<br/>
&gt; Yes, I know many who find out about letterboxing that way do some<br/>
&gt; research and are intelligent enough not to make erroneous <br/>
assumptions<br/>
&gt; but there are just as many who don't (witness the impetus for this<br/>
&gt; thread and the attention it's gotten). I'm willing to let these <br/>
stupid<br/>
&gt; people make fools of themselves and give them a little time to <br/>
figure<br/>
&gt; it out but I have no patients for people who feel entitled to make<br/>
&gt; letterboxing over the way they think the game should, nay MUST be<br/>
&gt; played and pronounce everyone else troublemakers or elitists for not<br/>
&gt; acquiescing to their demands.  And when did this turn into a hobby <br/>
for<br/>
&gt; children. I don't think that was ever considered when this all <br/>
started<br/>
&gt; up. It's only been recently that everyone began calling this a<br/>
&gt; "family" activity. It's great that those letterboxers with children<br/>
&gt; actually interact with them, unlike most parents today, but I don't<br/>
&gt; make my boxes for children. I don't have children and I don't know <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; different endurance and tolerance levels for your 3 yr old versus <br/>
your<br/>
&gt; 6 yr old and I have no intention of adjusting my clue writing<br/>
&gt; accordingly because you've decided that this MUST be a family<br/>
&gt; activity. Didn't start that way, I wasn't introduced to it as such<br/>
&gt; and, as I said I was told, the only rule is that there are no rules.<br/>
&gt; Finally I would not be involved in this hobby were it not for the<br/>
&gt; interesting and challenging clues, I'm sick of the childish rhyming<br/>
&gt; clues and pathetic boxes hidden with no imagination, creativity, or<br/>
&gt; thought; just a piece of Tupperware flung along the road with an old<br/>
&gt; eraser that looks like it was gnawed on by a rodent or worse yet a<br/>
&gt; stamp purchased from aisle 5 of the local Michael's. I'm let down <br/>
more<br/>
&gt; often by the dismal attempts to be clever than I am by a missing or<br/>
&gt; unfound box.<br/>
