                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just came back from a brief trip to New Hampshire with <br/>
FjordhorseLynn and Metoui's Chicken. We found<br/>
1) Fuller Public Library in Hillsborough-Beautiful old building!!<br/>
2) Live Free or Die near Wentworth by the Sea hotel! Gorgeous <br/>
area to wander around<br/>
3) Take Refuge 2-wonderful hike- Take Refuge 1 was missing.<br/>
4) SeaCoast 2 letterbox in the Urban Forestry Center -fun trail <br/>
and stamp and<br/>
5) Golden Pegasus on the same trail-Wonderful Stamp!<br/>
6) Adams Point combo geocache and Letterbox-our first <br/>
geocache-interesting.<br/>
<br/>
and we couldn't find several boxes-<br/>
1) Take Refuge 1-found the place it should have been but no <br/>
box-could park officials removed it or water carried it off?<br/>
2) Grimes Field-Searched but could not find-not entirely sure we <br/>
had the correct culvert as there were 3.<br/>
3) Portsmouth Harbor Light at Fort Constitution and<br/>
4) Hear the Sea at Fort Constitution-Either we were too weary of <br/>
the visitors to search fully or the boxes have been removed, <br/>
nevertheless the spot was beautiful so it was no real loss.<br/>
<br/>
Today Rhcash70 and Metoui's Chicken and I found <br/>
1) Tunxis State Forest-Nice hike though tough little hill in the <br/>
beginning and as if that wasn't enough we went to<br/>
2) Barrell of Monkeys and What a View-What a hill! I don't know if <br/>
I'm ready for the hills. Great view! Of Course without thinking we <br/>
were going to do the Old New-Gate Prison boxes until we <br/>
realized they were back up the same trail we had just <br/>
descended. Saving that for another day!!!<br/>
3) Fun in Spoonville-which I want to mention the box for the <br/>
second stamp is rather chewed apart, thus it doesn't seal at all. I <br/>
didn't have an extra container or I would have made the swap, <br/>
however I probably can when I go back out to Old New-gate <br/>
Prison-don't know when that will be.<br/>
<br/>
And finally while hiking on the Tunxis State Forest within the <br/>
hemlocks we found someones stamp in log book. It is in rough <br/>
shape but seems it only had a few entries on the first <br/>
pages-most importantly it has 5 state forest stamps so if this is <br/>
your book and you would like me to mail it back please email me  <br/>
privately. <br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
we had no luck with this either...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 3) Portsmouth Harbor Light at Fort Constitution <br/>
<br/>
This one is there - the directions for the two boxes at Fort <br/>
Constitution are confusing. The Portsmouth Harbor Light box is alive <br/>
and well as of our last visit on May 31st... unless something has <br/>
happened between then and now.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 4) Hear the Sea at Fort Constitution-Either we were too weary of <br/>

<br/>
We couldn't find Hear the Sea either- and the clues were a little <br/>
fouled up in case you didn't get the triangulation thing. It was a <br/>
fun site nonetheless as we enjoyed it also. Hope you come by the <br/>
southern maine boxes soon. I think no-one has stopped by the Estes <br/>
Lake Loon box...<br/>
<br/>
Take care! <br/>
Happy boxing, Phyto in Maine <br/>
