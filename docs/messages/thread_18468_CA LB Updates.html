<br/>
Clan Jiggs took advantage of the "lovely" Ontario-like spring wet <br/>
weather here in CA to add to out find total, by taking a little road <br/>
trip into the heart of the Napa valley!<br/>
<br/>
We were fortunate enough to find the following boxes in almost-<br/>
perfect condition...<br/>
<br/>
Napa...Not Wine - a grat box in a stunning setting located <br/>
in...well' you'll just have to figure that out!<br/>
<br/>
Westwood Hills Regional Park series #1 and 2 - both boxes found <br/>
after another leisurely, uphill stroll. #1 has seen about twice the <br/>
traffic as #2. Interesting to note that DoublesAJ and Old Blue <br/>
haven't hit these ones yet!!!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, we had lunch in a super brewpub  in Napa called the <br/>
Silverad Brewing Company...where we took a beer(!) tour of the Napa <br/>
Valley for a very reasonable $3.50!!!  Food was great, too!<br/>
