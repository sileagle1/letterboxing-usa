"rule" is, because of course there aren't any of those, but I'll ask how would <br/>
YOU count this kind of thing for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may remember awhile back I shared the story of how one of the <br/>
boxes in my area was found by a homeless man who broke the stamp and used the <br/>
logbook as his personal diary for awhile.   So the boxer who placed that box <br/>
recarved the stamp (same image) and replanted it in a compeletely different <br/>
section of the same park.   Different clues, different enviroment, etc.   (And <br/>
actually tougher (for me) to find than the first one.)   _The Letterboxer's <br/>
Companion_ says you should only count a box as a new find if it has a different <br/>
hiding spot, different clues, and a different stamp.   This one only had two out of <br/>
the three, but it was actually a very different finding experience.<br/>
<br/>
So for anyone who has time to ponder these questions of the universe, how <br/>
would YOU have counted this one?<br/>

<br/>
"Recarved" and "replanted" are the key words that make me think the <br/>
letterbox was moved.  Thus, it's not a completely new box, nor counts <br/>
as one.  It's a replacement box in a new location.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Do PFX counts really matter?  Truth be known, I'm not into letterboxing for<br/>
the PFX count. I do letterboxing for 2 reasons...<br/>
<br/>
The first one I am sure you'll all remember if because it affords me a<br/>
chance to do things with my family.  It introduces me with areas I might<br/>
never have seen and it shares with me, some one else's thoughts on that area<br/>
or at the very least, their thoughts on carving.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, it's because I enjoy competing, but, I make a terrible competitor.<br/>
I don't like to lose, in fact, I am a very bad loser. And I recognize that<br/>
fault in myself and have done a lot to remove that from myself. In this<br/>
hobby, however, I am not competing with anyone at all.  Just myself. And,<br/>
even if I lose to myself, well..... I've still won! (grin)<br/>
<br/>
So, as far as counting a box that I  have found before, I use this simple<br/>
equation:<br/>
<br/>
If it is the same named box, in the same location, but the stamp is<br/>
different, it's NOT a new find to me.<br/>
<br/>
If it is the same named box, in a different location whether or not the<br/>
stamp is changed, it IS a new find to me.<br/>
<br/>
If it is a different named box, in a different location, but the stamp is<br/>
the same, it IS a new find for me.<br/>
<br/>
My basis for determining this is, did I have to search and locate the new<br/>
box. Whether or not it's in the same park, if I can't walk right back up to<br/>
it again, then it's a new find for me.  I, personally, don't like the idea<br/>
of someone just moving the box to a new location for whatever reason, but,<br/>
if something happens to the original box, and they salvage the original<br/>
stamp, move it two trees to the left and over 6, make new or slightly<br/>
altered clues, then, to me, it's a new find.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, please, these are my opinion's and are not meant as an absolute<br/>
for anything to anyone.<br/>
