    We had a very busy letterboxing night tonight!  We intended on going out<br/>
to find one box, The Ram's new one called The Books.  We had many surprises.<br/>
We first stopped by to peak in the freestone box to see who had been<br/>
visiting since we last were there.  That's where we got our first<br/>
surprise!!!  We went on and found not one, but two hitchhikers.  First we<br/>
found The Y2K bug at Reach Out Hatchet at it's mystery location!!  Then at<br/>
the mysterious Books we discovered "Burr" the hitchhiker placed by the 4-H<br/>
Cock-A-Doodle-Moo Club!  Lots of fun!! We enjoyed our surprises, Thanks<br/>
everyone!<br/>

    Hey, I'm psyched to hear that you found the Y2K box.  That is one I<br/>
placed and I hadn't heard any updates on it.  Has it traveled to many other<br/>
spots and been stamped by lots of people?  That is the one that I was<br/>
testing the not so user friendly scroll idea on, is it a total disaster?  It<br/>
was born in Arcadia at Blurred Borders, have you guys placed it somewhere<br/>
new yet?  Don't respond where on this site, because people are<br/>
listening...but feel free to respond to me directly at sarah.fearing@gte.net<br/>
.  I'm so glad to hear that you guys, Jay Drew, and Eric are all going great<br/>
guns with Letterboxing.  I miss all the activity now that I am in Vermont,<br/>
but have already been talking it up, and hope to get it going more up here.<br/>
Let me know if you come across the Fuzzy Caterpillar.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
-Sarah- (former EMS manager)<br/>
