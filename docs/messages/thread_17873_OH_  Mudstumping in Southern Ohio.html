<br/>
We, Oregonians, will be in Loveland this weekend and wonder if anyone <br/>
can tell us if it is worth a day trip from there to Hocking Hills <br/>
SP.  We can leave early in the AM but need to be back by 4-5PM in <br/>
Cincy and are hoping to hike end to end and snag the letterboxes <br/>
nearby as well.  Can this be done?  I don't know how far this is, or <br/>
if accessability is limited in winter.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Ohio, but never knew about Hocking Hills!  I am shocked, <br/>
since we camped and hiked and boated all over the country, with this <br/>
place right in our back yard!<br/>
<br/>
Look forward to some new boxes in your area!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you <br/>

warm!)<br/>
<br/>
It can easily be a day trip-I came up with three or 4 boxes in the vincintiy<br/>
when we did our weekend getaway there--Old Man's Cave being  an awesome<br/>
site.<br/>
<br/>
A bit closer and full of boxes owudl be Eat Fork or Miami White Water.  Both<br/>
will yeild a fair amount of boxes in a relatively short amount of time.<br/>

Hocking Hills S.P. is a good 2 1/2 to 3 hours drive from Loveland so <br/>
that wouldn't leave a great amount of time for hiking if you have to <br/>
be back by 5:00.  The latest forecast I've seen shows a few showers <br/>
ending Sat. morning with partly cloudy and highs in the 40's <br/>
thereafter.  Use your best judgement as to whether it's worth it on <br/>
this trip.  It is a beautiful place but if boxing is your goal you <br/>
can probably find more just walking around Loveland than you would <br/>
get making this trip.  Hope this helps!<br/>
