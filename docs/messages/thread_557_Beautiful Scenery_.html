   The height of my 4th of July weekend, was the 5th! I had to go up to<br/>
Door County to visit a client of mine for a sweater I am crocheting for<br/>
them.  I brought Steven Stary along for we also had friend(s) to visit<br/>
up there.  <br/>
    I then proceeded to find the Mink River and the two new Bailey's<br/>
Harbor letterboxes.  The Mink River was gorgeous! With the river<br/>
flowing to one's right, one can see all the tourists enjoying the water<br/>
and boating and swimming, canoeing, etc.... A very cleaver location for<br/>
the box was discovered.  I would not mind living in the cabin, which is<br/>
the center piece of the clue.  What tranquilness.. (not sure if that is<br/>
a word.  But it is now!)<br/>
   Next was the Bailey's Harbor ones.  I went to the furthurest most<br/>
one first.  With the water being so blue and the sky imitating it, I<br/>
could not tell where one ended and the other began.  It was<br/>
unbelievable.  This clue is a bit more vague.  Yet a bit of reasoning<br/>
from Steve and I found it just by way of walking upon it.  The box<br/>
itself offers a delightful look at the passage into the bay from<br/>
Michigan.  As well as a view of Lake Michigan itself.  Wow is all I can<br/>
think of.  <br/>
    The 2nd of two B.H. boxes was wonderful.  A miniture forest with<br/>
small flora surround a foot bridge is the setting.  It would remind one<br/>
of being in a fairy tale.  Lily of such orange fire, purple little<br/>
"snap dragon" type flowers lend some support, tiny pines and evergreens<br/>
fill in the rest!  Again one walks upon the clue and box.  What a joy! <br/>
I shall be taking in some of the trails around these letter boxes next<br/>
week when I drop off the finished sweater.  <br/>
    This was a beautiful way to spend time in God's country.  To top<br/>
this extordinary day off, a dinner at Northern Grill with Beer and good<br/>
friendship.  Then our good byes were said to friends and we departed.<br/>
My traveling companion fell asleep while I contimplated what I had just<br/>
seen that day.  Thank you Steve for such wonderful places to see and<br/>
walk though.  I can not wait until the others are placed.<br/>
A big hug and kiss for a job very well done.  Creative and Gorgeous at<br/>
the same time.<br/>
    Die xoxo<br/>
