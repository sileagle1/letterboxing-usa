fantastic! Thanks to Melissa and Dan for that wonderful late-season <br/>
hike. Wanda and Pete left a very interesting note there <br/>
yesterday: "This makes 50 for March. We're hoping to beat our record <br/>
of 86 letterboxes found in February." Wow! For those who don't know, <br/>
Wanda holds the US women's record for solo miles hiked, including <br/>
multiple ATs, the PCT, and the CDT. And yes, I've seen it: Pete CAN <br/>
keep up! It's wonderful seeing your stamps on the trail, Pete and <br/>
Wanda!<br/>
