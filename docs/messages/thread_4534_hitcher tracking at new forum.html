in message 10277 for those of us who love to talk and track <br/>
hitchers.  WE certainly don't wish to be the cause of any more <br/>
frustration or bad behavior in letterboxland, so we'll definitely be <br/>
using it whenever we have a need to express ourselves regarding <br/>
hitchers.  (In fact, for those who are interested, we already have!)<br/>
<br/>
We'll also be starting up a new hitcher tracking web-page as soon as <br/>
we are able.  What with so many other commitments, responsibilities, <br/>
hobbies, and no home computer, it will definitely be slow going at <br/>
first, but if folks are willing to bear with us and help out by <br/>
sending us updates and corrections, we are certainly willing to give <br/>
it our best try, even if it is just at the rate of trying to add one <br/>
new hitcher per workday or week.  The web site should be up and <br/>
running sometime on Monday.<br/>

WHY?<br/>

Or in a positive light I will suggest -<br/>
<br/>
A separate message forum for Letterboxes using a store bought stamp<br/>
<br/>
A separate message forum for Letterboxes hid in National Parks.<br/>
<br/>
A separate message forum for Letterboxes with animal stamps.<br/>
<br/>
A separate message forum for Letterboxes not hidden in Tupperware brand<br/>
containers.<br/>
<br/>
A separate message forum for discussing making stamps and/or stamp supplies.<br/>
<br/>
A separate message forum for the discussion of separate message forum for<br/>
Letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
A separate message forum for Letterboxes by State.<br/>
<br/>
This is the Letterboxing forum. I want to read only those things I want to<br/>
read and expect them served to me on a clean platter the way I like it. I am<br/>
unable to read the message headers to ascertain content so I want them<br/>
separated and spoon fed to me. I am unable to read HH or HITCHHIKER in the<br/>
Subject line so a separate message forum for Letterboxes is imperative! I do<br/>
not want to read just one forum and visit one web site, I want to read 12<br/>
forums and visit 12 web sites to Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, what is wrong with the HH tracking page on the LBNA site? Why do we<br/>
need another separate site.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I DON'T GET IT but many of you knew that already!<br/>
