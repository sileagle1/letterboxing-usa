The Russian Legend of the Firebird<br/>
(as told by Phillip Ramey<br/>
<br/>
A young Prince Ivan enters the demon Kashchei's magic garden to find the <br/>
Firebird, who is plucking golden apples from a silver tree.  The prince <br/>
catches the Firebird, then lets her go, but asks for a red feather as a <br/>
promise to come to the prince's aid whenever necessary.  After this incident, <br/>
the prince meets a group of thirteen princesses, who are in control of <br/>
Kashchei, and falls in love with the thirteenth.  The princesses return to <br/>
Kashchei's castle, and the love struck Prince Ivan breaks down the gates to <br/>
follow them inside.  Ivan is captured by Kashchei and his monsters, and they <br/>
prepare to turn Ivan into a stone as punishment.  However, the prince waves <br/>
the magic feather and the Firebird reappears.  The Firebird cause the <br/>
monsters to dance wildly until they collapse from exhaustion, then she guides <br/>
Ivan to a buried casket which holds Kashchei's evil soul in the form of a <br/>
giant egg.  Ivan smashes the egg, Kashchei dies, the captives are released <br/>
from their bondage and the prince and his princess are solomnly betrothed.<br/>
<br/>
In order to find the Firebird, there is no need to go to Kashchei's magic <br/>
garden.  All you have to do is follow the Firebird as she flies towards the <br/>
yellow sun.  When you reach the sun, turn around and follow the Firebird's <br/>
color back about 20 feet or so.  Then turn left and walk around the outside <br/>
of the Firebird's house until you get to the SSE corner.  You will find the <br/>
Firebird towards the top of the corner in the stone wall. <br/>
