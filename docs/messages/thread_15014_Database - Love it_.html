                    <div class="plaintext-content">personally, I love the database idea. I have already entered <br/>
my "finds" from  the last week! <br/>
If someone doesn't like it, they don't have to use it.<br/>
<br/>
I disagree that only the placer should post to the database. What if <br/>
the placer doesn't know about the database or just doesn't feel like <br/>
participating? As we discovered when we went through the "abandoned <br/>
box" exercise, not all boxers participate in this discussion board.<br/>
<br/>
If I get up on a Saturday morning and decide I'd like to look for <br/>
boxes that day, I can't expect to get a reply from an email to the <br/>
placer on the same day!  This database will allow me to easily check <br/>
whether someone has reported a find recently. Much better than <br/>
searching the talk list for "sitreps" about the box. If there is no <br/>
information, I am no worse off. But, if there is information, I think <br/>
this will help me encourage my sometimes reluctant crew to go look <br/>
for the box.<br/>

Just my 2 cents,<br/>

<br/>
I also like the database. (But I'm also a "newbie" so some may think <br/>
my opinion doesn't matter. Whatever.) I have two kids (one being only <br/>
3) and if a hike is hard, I know I don't want to attempt that one. <br/>
The comments section of the database can be a big help with that. <br/>
Some people don't put a difficulty on their clues and we get there <br/>
and find that we can't finish the hike with the kids. It's very <br/>
disappointing for all of us when that happens. It's also <br/>
disappointing to get to a box and find that it's missing or has no <br/>
stamp. For some people, letterboxing may just be about <br/>
the "challenge", but to us it's about the challenge AND the stamps. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I've gone through all my entries in the database and changed <br/>
them all. I've only listed the condition of the box, and only <br/>
commented on one that had a missing stamp. If anyone wants aditional <br/>
info on any boxes that I've found, you can email me offlist and I'll <br/>
be more than happy to let you know if it's a difficult hike, or <br/>
dangers of snakes, or whatever else you might want to know. <br/>
<br/>
One final thing, I can't believe how much some people can bellyache <br/>
on this board. I belong to at least 4 other yahoo groups, not to <br/>
mention a few MSN groups, and I've never seen so many people complain <br/>
about stuff. It's like anytime someone makes a change or suggestion, <br/>
someone on here has to complain. I know you can't make all the people <br/>
happy all the time, but this is getting a bit ridiculous. <br/>
<br/>
And that's all just MY opinion and if someone doesn't like it, please <br/>
take it offlist. There's no need to "clutter up" the list with such <br/>
nonsense.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree, Lynda, cavy lovers, and others. Where I am located there <br/>
are only 6 boxes within an hour's drive each, in four different <br/>
directions. Normally, I will be taking two children with me. To <br/>
drive for an hour, hike for awhile in this South Texas heat, and not <br/>
find a letterbox would be very disappointing. It is very easy to <br/>
check the database first, to see what has been reported lately. If <br/>
there are additional comments about conditions (construction, <br/>
damage, sightings of more rattlesnakes than normal, or one that <br/>
seems to have taken up resting near the boxes location, or any other <br/>
qualifying factors), I would want to know beforehand. It seems a <br/>
simple thing. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I plan on letterboxing on our trips and vacations. I would <br/>
definately want to know if a box is 'possibly' missing or damaged, <br/>
or if the terrain was especially rough for children, or in a dicey <br/>
location before altering our route to include going out of our way <br/>
for a box. You can bet that before any trip, I will check the <br/>
database as well as the letterbox location listings. As to boxes <br/>
reported missing, that are not actually missing, the placer can <br/>
change the note in the database after he/she checks on it, or if <br/>
he/she can't check on it, wouldnt someone else be able to say, "Hey, <br/>
I found it, and it's not really missing.' Again, with a little <br/>
cooperation, good sense, and good will, it seems a small thing to <br/>
fix.  <br/>
<br/>
As for what you said about the 'bellyaching', Lynda, I agree there <br/>
too. I belong to 27 newsgroups, 3 other lists, and am a regular in a <br/>
couple of forums and chatrooms. Nowhere else have I seen anywhere <br/>
even close to the amount of 'bellyaching' as goes on here. It is <br/>
discouraging and requires quite a bit of 'stamina' to continue on <br/>
reading here. One person comes up with an idea or opinion, then <br/>
maybe a dozen have to tear down that opinion or idea, then .... <br/>
well, you get the idea. <br/>
<br/>
MahJong, THANK YOU for the database. I hope everyone will use it or <br/>
NOT, as you wish. <br/>
