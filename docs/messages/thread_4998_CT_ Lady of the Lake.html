<body>Hey Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to give you a heads up on a terrific (fairly) new box planted
by Letterboxer 2002.  Called Lady of the Lake - this box is to die
for - truly!  Not only is it in an incredibly cool state park - one
of the best I have seen, the box has the most awesome twist to it when
you finally arrive!  And the stamp is a work of art itself!  I
know I sound like I am raving - but for being a "newbie" - I
think Alan has done some incredible hides and stamps.  He is a most
welcome addition to the game!  If you get a chance - check this
great box out!<br/>

How com many of these e-mail messages don’t also write in the State and City of the location of the boxes.   I am not looking in the right place?

&gt; I must agree with Elizabeth.  I did the 'Lady of The Lake' box at <br/>
Squantz Pond in Ct. and it was a superb box.   Most enjoyable and <br/>
in a beutiful area.  It has a very intresting twist to it and I hope <br/>
that it does not come to any vandalism.  Here here to Letterboxer2002.<br/>
