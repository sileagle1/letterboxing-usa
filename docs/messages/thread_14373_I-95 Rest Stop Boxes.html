You've inspired me, I'd like to place some rest stop boxes as well. <br/>
<br/>
I-95 S, VA 108 Rest Stop - since we will in this area twice next <br/>
month, we decided to save this one for later.<br/>
<br/>
I-95 S, NC 99.5 Rest Stop - several people have stamped in; the box <br/>
was in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
I-95 N, SC 171 Rest Stop - box in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
I-95 N, NC 99.5 Rest Stop - I should have been able to figure out <br/>
which way was south, since we were traveling north on I-95. The rest <br/>
of the team had to put me back on track. Then I didn't think the tree <br/>
I was at was a pine. It was so close to another tree that I missed <br/>
it. Everyone else was yelling "It's a pine. Look up." Once I looked <br/>
up and could see the needles I realized it was a pine and I was in <br/>
the right place afterall. Box in good shape.<br/>

If it helps we are traveling 64, 295, 95, 81, 15, after that it's mostly<br/>
