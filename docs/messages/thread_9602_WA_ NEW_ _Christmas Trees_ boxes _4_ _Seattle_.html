<br/>
Please be sure you read the clues through before you leave the house!! And make sure you get the poem sheet (link below) to take with you.<br/>
<br/>
Washington Park Arboretum<br/>
Seattle, WA (King county)<br/>
4 boxes total<br/>
Planted on 12-8-02 by Candlelight<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From downtown Seattle: drive east on Madison St. to Lake Washington Blvd. E; turn left into the Arboretum From Interstate 5: take exit 168 (Bellevue-Kirkland) onto Hwy. 520; take first exit to Lake Washington Blvd. E., and follow it into the Arboretum From east of Lake Washington: drive east on the Evergreen Point Bridge (Hwy. 520) to the first Seattle exit (Lake Washington Blvd. S.); from the ramp turn left into the Arboretum Buses: 11, 43, and 48 run near the Arboretum. Business offices are located at the Graham Visitors Center: 2300 Arboretum Drive East.<br/>
<br/>
My husband did the artwork for the stamps and carved them himself. (This means the stamps are good. :)<br/>
<br/>
YOU MUST PRINT OUT THE POEM SHEET BEFORE YOU GO AFTER THE BOXES!!!. You will need this sheet to put the stamps in the proper order with the parts of the poem. Go to http://weatherwitch.net/candlelight2/frost/frost.pdf for the poem sheet.<br/>
<br/>
You may want to get a map of the Aboretum at the visitor center before you start so you can go exploring when you're done finding the boxes. You can also print one out from their web site (http://depts.washington.edu/wpa/html/wpa02trailmap.pdf).<br/>
<br/>
Start by parking in the lot below the Graham Visitors Center. Walk up the hill, and when you reach the sign that says Donald G. Graham on it (this is very close to the center itself), veer to the right and go just past the "Closed at Sunset" sign.<br/>
<br/>
Walk along Azalea Way. Turn left at the Woodland Garden sign and follow that trail. Go right up the first set of stairs. Go straight, towards a large cedar tree. When you reach the tree, take 21 steps to a tree on the right. Behind this tree, at the base, in some brush, is the first box. Please stamp in at this logbook, there will be no other logbook for this series.<br/>
<br/>
Continue down the trail 75 steps from the first box. There will be a cedar tree on your right. The second box is in the center of this tree. It is kind of a reach to get it, but I am 5'3" and could reach, so if you are under that height or have short arms, bring someone to help you!<br/>
<br/>
Continue down the trail, and take the right turn down the hill. Go up the path into the Rhody Hybrid Garden. A ways beyond "Contemporary Era" there will be a set of stairs going up and one going down. Go up. The third box is under brush at the base of a tree just to the left of the Marty Trosper bench (if you are facing the bench). Please be very careful with this one -- it is highly visible, since many trails converge nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Go down the stairs you just passed and onto Azalea Way. Take a left and walk on Azalea Way until you reach the Birch Bark Cherry trees (they have tags). Take a right onto the smaller trail from Azalea Way.<br/>
<br/>
Wind around to the right and stop at the first set of 2 stones. There is a cedar tree next to those stones. Behind the cedar tree, at the base, under some ferns and some cedar needles/stuff, is the fourth box.<br/>
<br/>
to get back to the start, retrace your steps until you find Azalea Way and take a right onto Azalea Way. You can follow this all the way back to the visitor center.<br/>
<br/>
Please read the waiver/disclaimer (http://letterboxing.org/wa/waiver.htm) before you start.<br/>
<br/>
Any problems, contact Candlelight2(at)weatherwitch.net<br/>
<br/>
These boxes will only be available for the Christmas season, until next year, when I plant them again...<br/>

Visited your Christmas Tree boxes today.  There was no rain!  Great stamps,<br/>
great locations, great park!  All the nearby boxers should get out there and<br/>
get these great stamps in their log before they are gone.<br/>
<br/>
Tell your husband the stamps are fantastic!!!  He should do many more so we<br/>
can enjoy them.<br/>
<br/>
I was fourth to get them.  dvn2r ckr and her cohorts, Team Garlic, and<br/>
Lizard and Catbird have also enjoyed your efforts.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Fudrick<br/>
