                    <div class="plaintext-content">HI there, The hitch hiking stamps stayed with me for about ten days. I <br/>
picked them up Dec. 11 in the UC Davis (CA) letterbox, the box with the <br/>
world's gutsiest hiding place. Then I brought it home with me to OR and <br/>
left them in one of our local boxes on the 21st. I tried to figure out <br/>
its path and finders but it wasn't labelled well. (No dates or <br/>
locations entered) But I think it went from its original home, the <br/>
Pilgrim (probably in PA) to Finger Bridge(?), to Merrill Creek (a <br/>
recent posting tipped me off that this is in NJ) to the Davis box. As <br/>
far as I know it hasn't left the spot I placed it yet. I do think it's <br/>
very cool that it has gone coast to coast! Funhog<br/>
