Gabreil Daveis Tavern was built in 1756 to serve those traveling on <br/>
the Timber Creek. Being a good Quaker, the only libation Gabreil <br/>
Daveis served was ale.  Oh yes, you could buy apples grown at the <br/>
orchard hard by the tavern.  <br/>
<br/>
The tavern tour is interesting (Sundays 1 - 4 p.m. except during the <br/>
winter).  The tour is free, but donations are appreciated.  <br/>
Ghosthunters have claimed that wounded Revolutionary war soldiers <br/>
were housed in the attic, which still bears the blood stains. <br/>
The attic, however, is not on the tour and the tour guide will <br/>
probably tell you that it never happened anyway...<br/>
<br/>
After you've checked out the tavern, have a seat on the farthest <br/>
stone bench from the parking lot.  After you're done enjoying the <br/>
shade, look way behind you and spy William Schuck.  To the left of <br/>
Mr. Schuck is a small path.  Go down the hill to the auditorium. From <br/>
the six upright pillars, take the small path at 90 degrees.  Mind the <br/>
stickers now. The way is passable, but painful to the unwary.  <br/>
<br/>
At the triangle of logs, continue at 90 degrees.  When you come to <br/>
the fork in the path, take the one at 35 degrees.  Pass a large hole <br/>
on your left.  Just past the hole is a small path at 320 degrees.  <br/>
Continue down this path until it makes a sharp bend to the left. <br/>
AHA!  Another hole (280 degrees).  From the hole, go 6 paces at 110 <br/>
degrees.  See the tree trunk arching so that the top and the bottom <br/>
both touch the ground?  See how the branches have, nevertheless, <br/>
sprung up from the middle and are reaching for the sky? What a cool <br/>
tree!  Hug it.  Check it out from all sides.  Explore its crevices.  <br/>
It can be very rewarding, this tree hugging stuff.<br/>
