                    <div class="plaintext-content">We decided that it would be better for the stamps we are including <br/>
in our placed boxes if they were mounted, however, not having access <br/>
to scrap wood or a saw (both of live in apartments in the city), we <br/>
opted instead to buy commercial stamps from the bargin bin at <br/>
Michael's or A.C. Moore (we picked some up for as little as 60).  <br/>
<br/>
Using a razor blade or X-Acto knife, we simply carve off the rubber <br/>
stamp and then peel the plastic with the image from the other side.  <br/>
What you are left with is a block of wood perfect for mounting a <br/>
stamp!  We wash the wood to remove any excess adhesive and, once <br/>
dry, mount our carved stamp on the wood using a high-quality rubber <br/>
and wood glue.<br/>
<br/>
Voila!  Mounted stamp without any woodworking.<br/>
<br/>
And for 60 to $1.00 per "block", probably as cheap.<br/>

You realize, a lot of rubber stamp stores sell pre-fabricated mounts <br/>
already.  Ready to use!  The photos of mounts in my carving tutorial <br/>
(http://www.atlasquest.com/tutorials/carving/mounting.html)--I just <br/>
bought the mounts as-is.  Depending on the size, they cost between <br/>
65 cents and a dollar each, I think.  Requires no wood-working, and <br/>
I don't have to carve off the rubber stamp from a finished stamp <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
I'm unemployed and homeless, so wood-working tools are not in my <br/>
budget at the moment.  =)<br/>

foam board for my mounts. It's cheap and readily available at most <br/>
craft type stores.<br/>
<br/>
Heres a link to a short tutorial of how I mount our stamps<br/>
<br/>
http://www.picturetrail.com/bindle_boxers<br/>
<br/>
When I first began carving, my stamps were around the 3 inch size so <br/>
I liked the "heft" of the half inch foam board to mount them on.<br/>
<br/>
Now my stamps are not quite so large and I find that the thinner <br/>
foam board works just great. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
