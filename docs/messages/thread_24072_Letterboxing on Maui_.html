I can't tell you about any boxes, but can highly recommend a trek to take on Maui and a cafe to go to.  The drive up Halakala (sp?) is awesome and take a panoramic camera.  The pictures you'll take thru the clouds from above the tree line are awesome.  You'll need jackets no matter what the temp is at the bottom, cuz it's windy up there.  After you get down there is a cafe called Ian's Cafe.  The muffins are great there and they're huge.  I hope it's still there, we were there in July of 1990.  The owner (I think) had a wonderful scottish brogue.  The Maui Tropical Plantation is also a must see.  Probably a good place to plant a box or 2 if they let you.  Like I said it's been a while since I've been there, but we still have wonderful memories of there along with a picture of us (my boyfriend at the time) with parrots on our shoulders.  I didn't know anything about letterboxing back then, but have found it since then and know you'll have a blast while you're there.<br/>
