<br/>
Just wanted to remind everyone that there will be a letterboxing summit<br/>
in the Pacific Northwest in the Portland area of Oregon on April 28th.<br/>
We are very excited.  <br/>
<br/>
Also...THANK YOU VALERIE!!!  I got our LBNA patches in the mail<br/>
yesterday and they are beautiful.  Thanks for taking that task on.  If<br/>
you have any spare decals, please let me know.  Wish you could be here<br/>
for the summit.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have two decals if you or anyone else wants them. The order form showed <br/>
decals at 2.5"x8" with the logo on the left side and the text "Letterboxing <br/>
North America" on the right. The actual decals that were made are a big 6" <br/>
X 6" square logo with "WWW.LETTERBOXING.ORG" beneath. OK, but a little too <br/>
big to fit anywhere I'd want to put it and not at all what I expected. <br/>
(Disappointing since I was really looking forward to sticking one on my <br/>
truck.) Let me know if you want them and I'll drop them in the mail for <br/>
you. You can send a postal address off-list if you'd like.<br/>
Love the patches though. Already started sewing one on my girlfriend's daypack.<br/>
