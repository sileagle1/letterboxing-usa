<br/>
First did Washington Wolf Mystery Box.  The clues were extremely easy for a local person. But wow!! What great stamp!!! It is an incredibly detailed handmade stamp.  Its the first stamp I have seen using plumber's gasket material for the stamp medium.  I have tried carving using this stuff and it is tough.  Looks like a dremel tool was used but the detail is incredible.  If anyone gets the chance dont miss out the opportunity to pick this one up.  It is only about 6 miles from I-5 so if you are ever passing between Portland and Olympia dont miss this one!<br/>
<br/>
Next we went to Millersylvania State Park and got the 2 boxes that dvn2rckr left there.  The 2nd box takes a while to get to but the trail is really neat.  It is designed as a fitness trail that has little areas along the trail with signs directing you to perform certain excercises.<br/>
We did stretches, knee bends, chin ups and such.  It would be a great trip for kids, mine loved it.<br/>
<br/>
Finally we ended up at McLane Creek Nature Trail in West Olympia's Delphi area.  Very nice walk in the woods with lots of wetland animal viewing opportunities.  We were the first to stamp into the 2 boxes there.  What a shame that others haven't found this set yet.  Dvn2rckr makes light of her carving abilities but I think they are great stamps.  Her clues are especially good as they always have us second guessing ourselves.  It seems it will take us a while to catch up on all of  dvn2rckr 's boxes in the area.  Still lots of them we havent gotten to yet.<br/>
<br/>
Tally looks like this, 1 mystery box and 2-2box series found today for a total of 5 new boxes added to our F count.  Just to temp you all, we left the Thunderbolt Hitch Hiker somewhere out there too.  Now get out there before the rains come in earnest!<br/>

I hate to burst your bubble, but I actually met with Lone MassWolf <br/>
(who planted this Mystery Box) when he was in Portland, OR last year. <br/>
All of his stamps are store-bought. He admitted that he isn't about <br/>
that part of the hobby (the arty, carving part). He enjoys the hiking <br/>
and placing the Wolf Mystery series all over the country. <br/>
It is still a neat box to get on I-5 and you ought to visit the place <br/>
where it is hidden!  Really cool!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When we found the Wolf Mystery box several months ago, a GIGANTIC <br/>
Bald Eagle swooped down from a tree about 20 feet away from us while <br/>
we were stamping in.  It was a glorious, exhilirating experience!!!  <br/>
Also, not too long thereafter, a fire engine drove by along a nearby <br/>
road with its sirens blaring--then we were treated to a cacophony of <br/>
all of the wolves howling in response to the passing sirens.  It was <br/>
wonderful, eery and such an incredible experience all at once.  What <br/>
a neat location!!!<br/>

&gt; Wolf Mystery Letterbox.... I hate to burst your bubble.his stamps <br/>
are store-bought.<br/>
<br/>
My bubble is still intact.  The box is great, the stamp is wonderful <br/>
and the access is truly the best part.  It is still a cant miss in by <br/>
book. I truly hope that I can get to some of his other boxes in the <br/>
series as well.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the reply<br/>
