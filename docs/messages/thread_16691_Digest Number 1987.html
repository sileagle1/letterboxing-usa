They were in GREAT condition and a lot of fun - man am I out of shape<br/>

We looked for:<br/>
<br/>
Mystery Hiker 2002<br/>
This box is Unclaimed.<br/>
Placement date: Jan 3 2002<br/>
State: Ohio<br/>
County: Greene <br/>
Nearest city: Yellow Springs<br/>
Number of boxes: 1<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't there, provided I was looking in the right spot.  I dug out the<br/>
area where it was supposed to be but there was nothing and the markings were<br/>
pretty clear.  Unfortunatly there is no contact information to let someone<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to place my first box and I already have several areas chosen.<br/>

We found Old Man's Cave and Lake Logan this afternoon - both are dry <br/>
and in good shape.  Both have exceptionally good stamps as well!  <br/>
These two finds put us over the PFX150 milestone.  Onward and upward!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to the hobby Suzanne!  You picked a great place to start - <br/>
John Bryan State Park is a great park and is full of letterboxes.  <br/>
There are plenty of more frogs there (27 total?) and several non-frog <br/>
boxes too.  My personal favorite is the Horace Mann box - really cool <br/>
place.  There are several other letterboxers in the area too who I'm <br/>
sure will be happy to answer questions or help in any way they can.  <br/>
The Mystery Hiker 2000 box has unfortunately been missing for quite a <br/>
while - I'm sorry you spent time looking for it when you could have <br/>
been finding some of the other boxes that are there.  Here's <br/>
something that might help: When you plan your next letterboxing trip, <br/>
come to this list and use the search box to see if there are any <br/>
messages about the boxes you intend to look for.  That should help <br/>
you see if anyone else has had a problem with those boxes, how <br/>
recently they may have been found, etc.  You can also post a message <br/>
and ask for reports about the boxes you intend to hunt.  Hopefully <br/>
that will minimize the frustration.  Glad to have you in the hobby - <br/>
have fun with it!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS. When you run out of boxes in Yellow Springs, come on down to <br/>
Chillicothe and Jackson - we have several here too!<br/>
<br/>
PPS. Duh!  I did everything but answer your question.  An exchange <br/>
occurs when you meet another letterboxer in person and exchange <br/>
personal stamps with them.  You may see my personal stamp image in <br/>
many letterbox logbooks but the only way you'll get it in your <br/>
personal log is to meet me in person.  Hope this helps!<br/>
