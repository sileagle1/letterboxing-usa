better respond publicly to that Providence Journal<br/>
article about letterboxing "on the tupperware trail",<br/>
just so anyone interested would know what happened!<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, most folks realize by now that reporters<br/>
sometimes put a strange slant on things, misquote<br/>
words or misreport numbers, so probably no one except<br/>
myself was particularly shocked to see that my F count<br/>
had suddenly been inflated by several hundred boxes!!<br/>
Anyone who knows me would realize that certainly<br/>
wasn't MY doing (I've had to work too hard to get my<br/>
count up to where it is to want to have anything MORE<br/>
to have to strive for, thank you!) but for those who<br/>
hadn't heard and might want to know, here's what<br/>
actually happened, as I explained to the group of us<br/>
who gathered to greet Amanda in Providence last<br/>
weekend. (Yes, we were there, too, dropping off HH<br/>
-like coals to Newcastle- on our way  to Boston!)<br/>
<br/>
So, the reporter had first called me about a month<br/>
ago and asked me how many letterboxes I had found. I<br/>
told him at that time my found count was 2280.<br/>
Apparently when he wrote down the second 2, it must<br/>
have later looked to him like a 7, because that's what<br/>
came out in print!<br/>
<br/>
Now, even after a couple of recent trips to PA and MA<br/>
(since we've already found most of the boxes in CT and<br/>
RI!:-), we've still only managed to add on another<br/>
hundred boxes or so to our count, so I guess we'll<br/>
just have to plan longer trips to places like VA and<br/>
OH to finally get our count up there to where Bryan<br/>
Rourke wants it to be!!! Oh, well... I guess it could<br/>
have been worse! If he thought our low-key little<br/>
adventure in Gloucester,RI was like an intense hunting<br/>
expedition for "plastic prey", I shudder to think what<br/>
he might have made of something like the upcoming<br/>
"dead gerbil gathering", with folks ready to pounce<br/>
"bare-handedly" on a basketful of the "colllective<br/>
kill"!:-) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Pete's finally gotten around to posting our<br/>
numbers on our webpage, just so no one thinks we're<br/>
getting ahead of ourselves here, and one of these days<br/>
maybe we'll even get our state-by-state count posted,<br/>
since that is what seems to most interest me!(73 in<br/>
PA, 70 in ME, etc.)So...<br/>
<br/>
"Happy Hunting", as they say :-)<br/>

   Wanda you are one amazing gal! Do you have wings on your feet? <br/>
