First of all, I'd just like to say hello. I went letterboxing for the <br/>
first time yesterday, and i cant wait to go out again over the <br/>
weekend. I live in Fairfield County, CT. It's great that their are so <br/>
many boxes hidden around here!<br/>
<br/>
I have a question. Do we have to make up special identies, or can we <br/>
just sign with our real names? The stamp i have says "Lauren". I'm <br/>
not concerned about people knowing who i am, but i was wondering if <br/>
the nicknames were a big part of letterboxing. I looked over the FAQ <br/>
but couldnt find anything about this. Thanks<br/>
<br/>

wanted a letterboxing name.<br/>

I'm glad you can join us for letterboxing fun.<br/>
I think the creative names are fun.  I chose Bird Stamper because I <br/>
band birds with serialized aluminum leg bands, thus stamping them <br/>
with a number.  So I got a stamp with a bird on it so I could stamp <br/>
the log books with a bird also. :)<br/>
Go to the web site, click on "Search for boxes", click on the drop <br/>
down menu for "Pick a placer", and you will get a list of the names <br/>
registered on the web site.<br/>
Use your own name or pick a funny one.  Being creative is the fun <br/>
part.<br/>

First of all, I'd like to say "thank you" for being a newbie that has <br/>
an interesting question (nothing against the newbies, just have read <br/>
the subject lines a 100 times). You made me think. When I started <br/>
lboxing I had the same problem. In my case, I chose to just go by <br/>
"Mark", which of course is my name. My e-mail address said more about <br/>
me (ndnboxing). Say it fast...<br/>
But, I've come to learn that I love those crazy names out there. I'm <br/>
still glad I chose to use my real name, but I really love all the <br/>
psychomommy, SpringChick, Rustypuff, Autumn, Amanda from Seattle, <br/>
Funhog, leger de maine, catbead, etc monikers out there. I love 'em <br/>
all! <br/>
<br/>
If you want to take the time to scrutinize it, or something in your <br/>
life denotes who you are (activities, personality, so on), use it to <br/>
make a name just to keep the scene interesting. If not, just be <br/>
"Lauren", and be the best you can be at it. Have fun!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for making me remember all this,<br/>
Mark <br/>

Hmm...  I actually thought of Smokey and the bandit movies...  LOL<br/>

<br/>
LOL  I'm old enough to remember when CB Radio first started (when they had<br/>
tubes in them) and the original idea of handles was to hide the true identity<br/>
of the owner...  Behaviors that would NEVER be exhibited by the people in<br/>
question became OK on the radio behind the handle...  And then you would meet<br/>
them at a radio gathering of sme sort and they would be completely different! <br/>
Thank God!<br/>
<br/>
Now that said I have never seen that type of behavior here..  It just is one of<br/>
those things that I wouldn't do.  And actually I didn't do it on CB radio and<br/>
OFTEN got grief for using my real name...  And when I got my ham radio license<br/>
in 1975 or so no one used anything but our real names...  Actually I like the<br/>
ones in use here...  Imaginative and colorful.<br/>
<br/>
So to each their choice!<br/>
<br/>
Tom ( of Tom &amp; Suz )  Wait! is that a pseudonym too???  LOL<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; First of all, I'd just like to say hello. I went letterboxing for <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; first time yesterday, and i cant wait to go out again over the <br/>
&gt; weekend. I live in Fairfield County, CT. It's great that their are <br/>
so <br/>
&gt; many boxes hidden around here!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a question. Do we have to make up special identies, or can <br/>
we <br/>
&gt; just sign with our real names? The stamp i have says "Lauren". I'm <br/>
&gt; not concerned about people knowing who i am, but i was wondering if <br/>
&gt; the nicknames were a big part of letterboxing. I looked over the <br/>
FAQ <br/>
&gt; but couldnt find anything about this. Thanks<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lauren<br/>

My nickname is one that my roommate came up with 'cuz she has two other friends with the same name as my real one. Whatever floats your boat!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the movie was Any Which Way But Loose and the sequal, Any Which Way You Can. Clint Eastwood and an Orangutan name Clyde. Funny movies. Haven't seen them in years tho.<br/>
<br/>
Right turn Clyde! :)<br/>

CBish, huh?  Wow, I never thought of it that way (though now that the idea has been planted in my head I will always get images of large orangutans sitting shotgun- wasn't that a CB movie?  *ponder*)<br/>
<br/>
I'm a huge comic book fan (thus, the Delirium name), and the idea of secret identities appeals to me.  That's why I like the trail name bit.  It's part of the piratey, treasure hunting, spy game aura I associate with the sport.<br/>
<br/>
CBish?  *sob*<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
