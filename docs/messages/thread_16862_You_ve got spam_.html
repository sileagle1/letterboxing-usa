                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry for the continued "new pix here" posts. This stuff is called <br/>
hit-and-run spam, and is pretty nifty in a weird way: someone has learned to join <br/>
multiple yahoogroups lists and auto-post links to nonfunctional geocities websites. <br/>
It's no coincidence that it's yahoo/geocities: they are as alike as <br/>
Toyota/Lexus, as Coke/Aquafina, as Microsoft/Hotmail, as...well, you get it. The only <br/>
current defense is to up the moderation factor, something we haven't done on <br/>
this group. According to yahoo, Norton, and McAffee, clicking on the posted link <br/>
does not yield hidden spyware or cookies. Not sure if I believe that, but...as <br/>
RyanC has said, if it's not from someone you recognize, don't fall for it. If <br/>
people are really getting bugged by this nastyness, please let us know by <br/>
posting here to the list and we'll take up the subject of "first post moderation" <br/>
again.<br/>
