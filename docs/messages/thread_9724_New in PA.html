<br/>
<br/>
This is my first submittal. Please let me know if something needs attention.<br/>
(Which is better - the written disclaimer that appears at the bottom - or<br/>
simply a statement at the end referring them to the disclaimer-?) Thanks for<br/>
your help and direction.<br/>

THE MERCER HUNT<br/>
<br/>
BLUE STAR <br/>
CRIMSON CAT<br/>
<br/>
Planted by Ed on 11/02<br/>

Nearest town: Doylestown<br/>
Trail rating: 1st leg easy<br/>

<br/>
INTRODUCTION<br/>
<br/>
Located in Doylestown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania is an old growth forest, a<br/>
castle and a pottery &amp; tile works. This area, the walk along the way, and the<br/>
hunt for the "Blue star" and "Crimson Cat" are what you will enjoy today. Wear<br/>
good walking shoes. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
STARTING POINT &amp; DIRECTIONS<br/>
<br/>
You have two options:<br/>
<br/>
1.) Park near the Mercer Museum/James Michener Art Museum complexes along Pine<br/>
Street in downtown Doylestown and walk up the hill to the Courthouse where you<br/>
will head east on Court Street for approximately one mile. Along the way, you<br/>
will experience the sounds and sights of Doylestown<br/>
as well as the many beautiful and interesting 19th century homes. You will<br/>
eventually approach two concrete pillars on the left that guard the entrance<br/>
to the Moravian Pottery &amp; Tile Works where the hunt really begins. This walk <br/>
is<br/>
know as the "Mercer Mile".<br/>
<br/>
2.) If a sightseeing walk is not on your calendar for today, then park on <br/>
Court<br/>
Street by the cemetary and walk about 1/4 mile to the two pillars.<br/>
<br/>
