To make a rather long story short, one of NJ's promising young citizens broke<br/>
into my car while I was slaving away at my job, and stole a ton of my stuff. <br/>
In his dash to grab as much as he could, he took my letterbox stuff.  I don't<br/>
know why he could want it, but he took it too.  I was wondering about one<br/>
thing.  For the boxes that were put out for the last gathering, were they<br/>
re-hid somewhere?  If so, great.  If not, could you bring the stamp to the<br/>
gathering? I have to re-amass my stamp count, since I've been knocked back to<br/>
zero, my boyfriend has more stamp images than I do now (grrr).  <br/>
Oh, I'll still be coming up with my dog, but the closest we could get was<br/>
Salem, CT.  The campground across the street allows dogs, but only if you have<br/>
an RV.  They apparantly think I can cook my dog in my tent, but not in a<br/>
pop-up.  So, I'll see everyone Saturday.<br/>

What a total bummer!!!  That really stinks!<br/>
<br/>
As to the stamps, I know that for the one YOU found in the old jalopy (sp?) across the street, Susan modified the stamp image somewhat, and Erik hid it up in the woods.  I think the pub stamp is still in the pub.<br/>
<br/>
You could get color copies of Royce's stamp images, maybe...<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing you, Royce, the dog, and all other letterboxers this weekend.<br/>

<br/>
Very sorry to hear about the break-in and the loss of your <br/>
letterboxing materials, but am glad you still have the car! So we'll <br/>
see you in just two days.<br/>
<br/>
The killington stamps are all still hidden down there as far as I <br/>
know - I haven't done a spring check on them yet. But I wouldn't be <br/>
able to get down there to get them before heading off tomorrow for <br/>
CT. I guess we'll just have to have a VT reunion soon!<br/>

the car break in bozo also be the letterbox vandal who has <br/>

foreign accent and a big mustachio?<br/>

Re: Salem, are you staying at Witch Meadow? The whole town is quite <br/>
close by.<br/>

Re: Your "count" of P4F0. I don't think you have to erase all your <br/>
finds just because the stamp images have moved to Hoboken. I'll check <br/>
my LBNA rulesbook, but I think that once found, never lost is best.<br/>
