I was the one arguing with Ryan about whether or not to count this as <br/>
One Box or Three boxes!  I am waiting for an official ruling... I had <br/>
a feeling that you might have intended it to be only a single <br/>
letterbox---but those two "clues" are stamps too and Ryan wants to <br/>
count everything!!<br/>

<br/>
WEll, this is what we did...even though there was no logbook to sign <br/>
in on in the first two "clue" stamp/boxes, we created "logbooks" with <br/>
paper we had along and left them in the boxes for future seachers.  <br/>
So there was the EXCHANGE of stamp images. And a record of it for <br/>
future seekers.<br/>

&gt; I am interested in the opinion of several more of the founders on<br/>
&gt; this issue.<br/>
<br/>
I like the decentralized approach to implementing letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
It only follows, then, that decisions such as this be made in a <br/>
decentralized way, which is what happens everytime someone finds an <br/>
artifact in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
I think the FAQ is a decent guideline on this issue but not the <br/>
be-all-end-all.  Do what feels right.<br/>
