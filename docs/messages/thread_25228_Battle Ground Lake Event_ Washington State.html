                    <div class="plaintext-content">That pretty much sums up my knowledge of Karl. I think this was his one and only contribution to the hobby. When LbNA converted over to become database-driven, there was no longer anyone to contribute this clue to. Rather than delete it or put it in the Letterboxing Basement, Wes Garrison and Jay Drew apparently decided to assign it to me, since it was a follow-up of one of my clues. Once I realized what had happened, I decided that I might as well adopt it officially.<br/>
