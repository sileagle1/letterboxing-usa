They are not allowed in several areas that we will be in like Avalon (17 year ick box) McKeldin, Hollofield (camp loop only, no trails). I am definatley still coming but I will probably leave me faithful companion, Dude the Wonder Dog, at home. I don't want to be restricted as to where I go and I can't leave him at the site. So I thought anyone else with dogs would want to know. I am not sure how strict they are with the rules but some parks have pretty hefty fines. I am a very poor person so can't risk it. See you tomorrow!<br/>
