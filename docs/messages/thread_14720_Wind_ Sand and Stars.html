                    <div class="plaintext-content">I hope this is ok to ask if anyone is familiar with the book, "Wind, Sand<br/>
and Stars" by St Exupery, Antoine de. I am doing some research for a series<br/>
of letterboxes.   If you have read it, did you like it and why. Why did you<br/>
read it? How old were you when you read it and how hard was it to read?<br/>
Would you recommend it?  The same author wrote, "The Little Prince".<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Chris <br/>
