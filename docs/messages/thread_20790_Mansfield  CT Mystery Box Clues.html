There were other boxes planted by individuals which are welcome but we have nothing to do with them. The mystery box in question, I don't even know who planted it or how long it is going to be out. I do have a copy of the clues and here it is.....Chuck and Molly<br/>

We were thinking about how much money you will be<br/>
spending to mail back the boxes to their owners. We<br/>
would be happy to mail you some $$ to offset the cost<br/>
of mailing our box home.<br/>

That goes for me too!  And, if you need help retreiving all those Monsters, I'd be happy to help out.  Maybe, once all those Monsters are gathered, we could kind of informally meet up somewhere (those of us who live nearby) to pick up our boxes and save Chuck some time and postage?  Just a thought.
