park today and were fortunate enough to have met Spacy Holly's<br/>
sister in the process. We were there for a quick reconn--there are<br/>
a handful of picnic tables around the park--lots of open fields for<br/>
frisbee/football type action and plenty of sandy/rocky/boulder edged<br/>
beachfront. We plan on packing some goodies for a picnic--<br/>
you're welcome to join us!  dvn2r ckr<br/>

Brown's Point Lighthouse Mini Meet<br/>
<br/>
Hi--for anybody out there who is interested in joining us, a few<br/>
letterboxers from the region will get together from 2-4 pm (may last<br/>
longer if the kids want to play for a while) on 31 July 04 at<br/>
Brown's Point Park (Lighthouse), WAY-WAY North Tacoma (practically<br/>
Federal Way at this point) to meet with Spacy Holly and her<br/>
letterboxing family from Southern California for exchanges.<br/>
<br/>
We plan on meeting at the flag pole in front of (West) of the<br/>
lighthouse keeper's cottage. The park offers expansive and<br/>
incredible views of the Olympic Mountains, Puget Sound, Vashon &amp;<br/>
Maury Islands, and depending on the tides lots of opportunity for<br/>
beachcombing and boulder scrambling. There's even<br/>
enough 'greenspace' to throw a football or frisbee. We plan on<br/>
bringing some picnic items, too.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know if you plan on joining us then.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we'll see you there?<br/>
