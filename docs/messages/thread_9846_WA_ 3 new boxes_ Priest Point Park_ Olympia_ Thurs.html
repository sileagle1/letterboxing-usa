Placed: 12-26-02 <br/>
Location:  Priest Point Park in Olympia, WA, Thurston County<br/>
Difficulty:<br/>
	Trek: Easy walk on mostly level well maintained trails, a few <br/>
steps but nothing rough.  Good location for kids and dogs.  <br/>
	Clues:  Easy with some compass use.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Priest Point Park:  From I-5 Northbound or <br/>
Southbound take Exit #105 to Port of Olympia.  This exit will put <br/>
you onto Plum St. headed northward.  Continue on Plum St to <br/>
intersection with State St.  Cross State and Plum becomes East <br/>
Bay Drive.  Follow East Bay Drive appx 1 1/2 miles and there will <br/>
be an entrance road on the right to Priest Point Park.  If possible <br/>
park on the East side of the park at the first parking lot (a bridge <br/>
is provided over East Bay Drive to the other parking lot).  <br/>
<br/>
About the Park:  Priest Point Park is the site of a former catholic <br/>
mission that was given to the city of Olympia many years ago.  <br/>
There is a nice playground for the kids, several covered picnic <br/>
shelters, lots and lots of outdoor picnic tables, beach access, a <br/>
very nice rose garden and miles of walking trails.  Being less <br/>
than 4 miles from the state capitol grounds, this park gets lots of <br/>
visitors throughout the year.  Best to visit on a weekday or earlier <br/>
in the day on any weekend in the peak summer season.  <br/>
<br/>
Other letterboxes in the park:  There are a total of 3 other <br/>
letterboxes hidden at Priest Point Park listed on the LBNA site.  <br/>
The Lost Loon Series by Trial and Error and the First Annual <br/>
Thanksgiving Day Letterbox ( we are not certain of the owner of <br/>
this box).  These were the first boxes that our family ever went out <br/>
to find.  We started with the Thanksgiving Day box but was <br/>
unsuccessful in finding this box.  We were rather discouraged <br/>
and decided after about an half hour of searching to give up and <br/>
try the Lost Loons.  We were further discouraged by the <br/>
non-specific clues to these boxes but after much `trial and error' <br/>
we did finally find the boxes.  We were immediately hooked.  We <br/>
then decided that we would place our own boxes in this beautiful <br/>
park.  However, family activities, the lure of other letterboxes, and <br/>
fatigue kept us away from this park until now.<br/>
<br/>
The Letterboxes:<br/>
We have named these boxes the "Nail Family Fun and Games <br/>
Series" because they are all based on games our family plays at <br/>
family gatherings.  We made these stamps to be placed in <br/>
Oregon this last Thanksgiving but were too stuffed to make it out <br/>
to a hiding location that holiday.  Boxing Day afforded us another <br/>
reason to plant boxes (as well as find some others recently <br/>
placed in our area).  Hence, there are now 3 new letterboxes at <br/>
Priest Point Park for enthusiasts to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
42 Letterbox<br/>
42 is a dominoes game that our parents and grandparents have <br/>
been playing at family gatherings like Christmas and <br/>
Thanksgiving for over 30 years.  It is a fun game that anyone who <br/>
can count to five can play.  If you find the box, email us and we <br/>
will send you the rules for this family favorite.<br/>
<br/>
Start at the upper parking lot (on the east side of East Bay Drive).  <br/>
Locate the Rose Garden.  Walk to the center of the pavilion and <br/>
take time to enjoy the flowers.  (We originally visited in August <br/>
and the roses were very beautiful and fragrant)  Move under the <br/>
atrium and continue past the memorials.  Pass some large logs <br/>
on your right and cross the wooden bridge.  Take the trail <br/>
between the shelter and the knobby tree and continue to the road <br/>
ahead.  Cross the road and hit the trail.  At the Y take 190 <br/>
(magnetic, of course). At the large fir, dont pass the divided log <br/>
and go down the slippery slope, but rather walk to the right along <br/>
the fallen log 7 steps.  42 rests beneath holly and huckleberry on <br/>
the opposite side of the log.  Rehide well as the color of this box <br/>
is very easy to see in the greenery. After you rehide the box, <br/>
return up the trail to the Y.<br/>
<br/>
Farkle!<br/>
Farkle is a dice game that can be lots of fun.  We have heard <br/>
people call it Farkle, Zilch, 5,000,  10,000, and other names we <br/>
dont let our children say.  It is a very simple game and can be <br/>
played by any number of players.  Find the box and we will email <br/>
you the rules.<br/>
<br/>
Start at the Y and take the trail you have not seen yet.  See the <br/>
knobby 12 ft dead tree on the left?  This is the tree that stumped <br/>
us on the 1st Annual Thanksgiving letterbox (never did find that <br/>
box). Continue on the trail to the next Y.  Stay right and go up the <br/>
incline.  There will be a large nurse stump on the right with a <br/>
toppled sapling.  You are on the right path.  Next find a giant fir <br/>
with a couple of smaller cedar friends in front on your left.  Turn <br/>
right  on the side trail going 80 degrees.  Go 16 steps on this <br/>
path over the small logs and on to the next Y.  Right then 20 <br/>
paces and a log will block the path.  Slide over the log and move <br/>
on to the Big Leaf Maple on the left that is covered with ivy.  Farkle <br/>
hides at its base behind some ferns in a little cubby that faces <br/>
the trail.  Hide it well as this box is brightly colored too.  If you <br/>
want the rules to Farkle please email us.  <br/>
<br/>
Nail'em!<br/>
Nail'em! is a card game that our patriarch, Robert Nail invented <br/>
for us to play at our family gatherings.  Robert was the most <br/>
intense gamesman I and most everyone else has ever met.  He <br/>
loved to play fun and competitive games.  For the rules to this <br/>
great game for 3-8 players, email us after you have found the <br/>
box.<br/>
