<br/>
There's a Pumpkinhead box by her at Mansfield Depot.  Is this the box that <br/>
you're referring to, or did she make two seperate Pumpkinhead stamps?  I'm <br/>
wondering if it was originally going to be at the Grist Mill but was instead <br/>
planted at Mansfield Depot?  The one at the Depot is still there, or at least was as <br/>
of Sunday morning.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I'm wrong.  Just trying to shed some light...<br/>
