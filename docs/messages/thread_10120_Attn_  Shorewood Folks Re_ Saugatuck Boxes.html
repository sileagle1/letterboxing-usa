The clues for Mt. Baldy indicate after climbing the 282 stairs, to <br/>

begins at the two posts does not go south, rather in a westerly <br/>
direction.  I did follow this for A LONG WAY up and down sand hills <br/>

lake.  There was snow on the ground so I may have missed it, but I <br/>
didn't have a feeling I was even on the right trail.  At the top of <br/>
the stairs, the only thing I could take south is to immediately go <br/>
down a steep hill, but this isn't really a trail or by the two <br/>
posts.  Nevertheless, I did try this route, nearly killing myself <br/>
sliding down the frozen sand dune, but nothing matched the clues once <br/>
I got to the bottom, even though I followed that path about a mile to <br/>
a road.  So, I climbed back up the frozen sand hill, and then down <br/>
the 282 steps to my truck.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I looked for these last September. I too was stumped by Mt. Baldy Jr. I spent half an hour pacing back <br/>
and forth on the beach in the rain debating whether I wanted to trespass on church camp property in <br/>
hopes that Mt. Baldy Jr might be back there in the trees. The two trails that seemed fit the clues (one <br/>
from the parking lot, the other from the beach) both lead directly to cabins occupied by campers, so I <br/>
gave up on this one. Anyone else been successful?<br/>
<br/>
Mt. Baldy was easier for me. I can't remember the exact compass direction, but the trail from the two <br/>
posts was a path wending southward along the ridge top. It was a gentle up and down trace,  <br/>
definitely not the trail dropping over the edge of the dune.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; From here I headed over to the beach for Mt. Baldy Jr. Despite the <br/>
&gt; huge waves and frigid lake wind, I bundled up and started down the <br/>
&gt; beach to the south, only to find that the park property ends and <br/>
&gt; private property begins before reaching any cottages.  I did see <br/>
&gt; cottages ahead, but did not see a large sand hill to the north of <br/>
&gt; them.  Frustrated and frozen stiff, I turned around rather than <br/>
&gt; proceeding past the park boundary.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any input would be appreciated on either of these boxes...  Thanks!<br/>
