<br/>
We visited the Native Plants LB series on Tiger Mountain in Issaquah <br/>
today.  What a great series with a nice hike.  Absolutely the <br/>
perfect distance for the company with whom I was hanging today.  All <br/>
three boxes were in place and in great shape--dry and plenty of <br/>
space left in the logbook.  The bag for the third LB was torn, <br/>
however, and unfortunately I didn't have a large enough replacement <br/>
bag on me at the time. For the next LB who attempts this series, <br/>
please bring a zippered plastic bag with you on the trek to help out <br/>
the Sitka Columbine box in this 'orphaned' series.  By the comments <br/>
in the logbook, I understand Buckaroo (the placer/owner) resides in <br/>
MA?<br/>
<br/>
A tad bit of confusion was listed in the logbook regarding the clues <br/>
to box #2.  There has been a lot of recent wind damage in this <br/>
region (fresh fallen trees all around the forest portion of the <br/>
hike) which probably adds to the confusion.  Perhaps the <br/>
word 'steep' when the trail gets much steeper should be emphasized <br/>
and that the mostly-deal (I think this should read 'dead') tree <br/>
covered in moss is more of a 'multi-trunked mostly dead moss covered <br/>
tree'--this might help lead you to the 2nd box.  It was actually 6 <br/>
steps off the trail as opposed to 6 paces (1 pace=2 steps) in <br/>
orienteering terms.  This was a great hike for kids and I'd <br/>
recommend this to anyone who has some kids who need some exercise <br/>
especially during these awesome sunny winter days we're having!!!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Buckaroo, thanks for a great letterbox series in a beautiful <br/>
location!!!<br/>
