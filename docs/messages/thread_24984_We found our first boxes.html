about it is we all had our own stamp and they all fit on one page.  <br/>
A couple were hand made and a couple were store bought.  My reasoning <br/>
behind everyone having their own stamp is so that when my kids grow <br/>
they can continue Letterboxing and taking their own stamp when they <br/>
move out (who know's when that will be, they tell us now they will live <br/>
with us forever).  So they all had their own 5x5 paper to make their <br/>
own books with.  <br/>
Whoever stamped before us was pretty cool.  They had gold ink!  And it <br/>
looked terrific. <br/>
The other cool thing was we were the first one's to stamp the book in <br/>
the new year so my girls haven't stopped talking about it.  <br/>
Punky did an excellent job at hiding these boxes and we made sure they <br/>
were sealed and back in their place, hidden.  THANKS! <br/>

<br/>
Did your first find happen to take place on your first search?  It <br/>
took me 3-4 searches before I found my first letterbox -- <br/>
fortunately, when I took friends this week for their first search, <br/>
they managed to find a letterbox I'd failed at, a year ago, when I <br/>
was a newbie.  I keep (halfway) joking that all I needed was a new <br/>
brain (my friend's), in order to find that letterbox.  (Helps if <br/>
you're looking in the RIGHT clump of trees!)<br/>
<br/>
Again, congratulations -- it's always fun to get outdoors for the <br/>
search, but a lot more fun when you actually find the box.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>

P.S. (Your Lake Perris on the Rocks -- is that in Perris, CA -- or <br/>
somewhere else entirely?  Also, I like your reasoning behind your <br/>
kids developing their own trailnames and stamps -- we'll have to do <br/>
that, too.)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes we found it on the first hunt.  I'm sorry you didn't find your first.  I can just imagine how that must have been a bummer.  I think it has alot to do with knowing the area too.  We knew most of the area that we went too.  Today we are going for about 6 of them.  But this time just two of my girls and myself.  So we'll be minus two brains lol.  We are actually leaving as soon as the girls are ready.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll let you know the outcome.  Covina!  That's down the road lol.  Yes Perris Lake, it starts at the back entrance.  But even though the weather was perfect for this you should still bring a bottle or two of water, pants, and snack bar.  Bikes would be ideal.  It states it's 1.2 miles from one point to another but I walk on a daily basis and that 1.2 was more like 2 miles.  I told hubby I'll have to go back with my mileage meter and clock it.<br/>
