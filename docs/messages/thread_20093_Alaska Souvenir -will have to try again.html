                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I went up on Mt. Roberts on the tram today with<br/>
friends who are in town on a cruise ship.  We had two<br/>
little ones plus one of the gals has bad knees and a<br/>
limp so we just did the big easy loop and didn't go on<br/>
the cross trail itself.<br/>
<br/>
I was sad but couldn't really break away as the kids<br/>
were hungry and crabby by then.  We hightailed it back<br/>
down the mountain and ate lunch at the Twisted Fish. <br/>
A fantastic meal of wild Alaskan salmon!  <br/>
<br/>
We saw blueberries and watermelon berries and false<br/>
hellebore (poisonous!) and many other things while on<br/>
the mountain.  It was a great short and easy hike.<br/>
<br/>
My mother-in-law is coming up next month and I am<br/>
hoping to get one more chance to go up.  Otherwise it<br/>
may have to wait till next year.  : (  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry Brett and Penny,<br/>
So close but yet so far, LOL.<br/>

Okie in Alaska<br/>

cranky, I've certainly done the same!<br/>
