Subject: Great boxing day in MD!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello!  The Basses had a very productive boxing day today!  We found <br/>
the Box On and Zodiac series in Black Hill park.  Except we <br/>
accidently skipped over the directions for Deanno's Capricorn, so <br/>
we'll have to go back sometime.  Still have to get the Birder Series <br/>
anyway.  We also found the Blair Letterboxing Project box.  We got 8 <br/>
stamps in all.  While hiking back to the car, from finishing the <br/>
Zodiac series, a huge owl swooped out in front of us, landing in a <br/>
tree.  You just never get to see (at least I don't!) owls out there, <br/>
so it was incredible to watch this thing in action!  He kept flying <br/>
fron tree to tree so close to us.  It was amazing that he never made <br/>
the smallest sound.  They are so silent.  It wasn't a horned owl, we <br/>
could see there were no "horns," but he was huge.  His wing span had <br/>
to be at least 4 feet.  It was very cool!<br/>
Keep an eye out for a new MD mystery box, coming soon.  I am also <br/>
working on an idea for an Artemis Fowl series.  Can't wait to get <br/>
started on it.  (hands rubbing together, maniacal smile...)<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
I am curious about how many people will end up finding the entire<br/>
series, and just how many boxes people end up with if not finding<br/>
every one. The letterbox senders must be VERY curious!!<br/>
So, the week on Nov. 1st, please e-mail me with your final tallies.<br/>
I'll post the results on the talklist and also submit the numbers to<br/>
Chuck for his webpage. It'll be a basic count, such as so-and-so many<br/>
people found them all, so-and-so many people found 75 to 100. Well,<br/>
you get the point.<br/>
May The Force be with you.<br/>
Catlover/gardener/teacher..plodding along with a pitifully low<br/>
MMM "found" count so far (loving this glorious fall weather though)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The family and I enjoyed a too quick weekend trip down to eastern<br/>
Tennessee this weekend.  We viewed the magnificent foliage and found<br/>
the Gatlinburg letterbox as a bonus.  It was great to get to view so<br/>
many signature stamps from folks around the country that we usually<br/>
don't cross paths with.  Very nice box - dry and in good condition -<br/>
and a very nice stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, we didn't have as good a luck with the Smoky Fir box. <br/>
Despite very good clues and a thorough search, we were unable to find<br/>
any sign of it.  We suspect the rangers may have got it.  Too bad. <br/>
The Park Service needs a more enlightened policy about this.  Hope you<br/>
all had a good weekend!<br/>

That goes for me too!  And, if you need help retreiving all those Monsters,<br/>
I'd be happy to help out.  Maybe, once all those Monsters are gathered, we<br/>
could kind of informally meet up somewhere (those of us who live nearby) to<br/>
pick up our boxes and save Chuck some time and postage?  Just a thought.<br/>

Subject: Survey responses requested!<br/>
<br/>
Hello, I am a college student who is doing an ethnographic fieldstudy on the<br/>
culture of letterboxers. I am seeking responses to my short 12-question<br/>
survey from any and all letterboxers. Most questions are in a "choose one<br/>
from the list" format while a few are in short answer form. It should not<br/>
take more than 10 minutes of your time to complete. Your responses may be<br/>
used in the final paper; I will email you directly to request your<br/>
permission if I wish to quote you. This survey is for educational purposes<br/>
ONLY. You may remain anonymous if you wish. I thank you in advance for<br/>
completing this survey. This will be a HUGE help with my fieldstudy!<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

This is a scam. I got a similar response from another group I was in. It <br/>
asked for a simple survery for  a grad student to complete a project. It<br/>
turned <br/>
out to be a marketing ploy. At the end of the survey you are asked  if you<br/>
would <br/>
be willing to be on a mailing list to receive sales information on a subject<br/>
<br/>
common to the group. The person who makes the request to complete the survey<br/>
<br/>
get money for each name who completes the bogus survey and gets targeted <br/>
marketing. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. <br/>

&gt; This is a scam. I got a similar response from another group I was <br/>
in. It <br/>
&gt; asked for a simple survery for  a grad student to complete a <br/>
project. It turned <br/>
&gt; out to be a marketing ploy. At the end of the survey you are asked  <br/>
if you would <br/>
&gt; be willing to be on a mailing list to receive sales information on <br/>
a subject <br/>
&gt; common to the group. The person who makes the request to complete <br/>
the survey <br/>
&gt; get money for each name who completes the bogus survey and gets <br/>
targeted <br/>
&gt; marketing. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. <br/>

I did the survey and there was no mention of mailing lists, etc. I have read<br/>
previous emails from Mystique and believe this is legitimate.<br/>
