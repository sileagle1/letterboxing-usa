I have mounted stamps to wood using the Donutz method of gluing the rubber to the wood and putting some weight on top of the rubber/wood to set the glue.  A couple of times, when checking the stamp, I would find that the wood slid and the rubber was partially off of the wood.  Still wet, I was able to adjust it and everything worked out ok.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband just got a clamping table and I was wondering if anyone clamps the rubber to the wood while allowing the glue to dry.  I would image that you would need to affix the rubber to the wood and then put another piece of wood on the face of the rubber so that your image wouldn't be compromised.  Any thoughts?  <br/>

I clamp the rubber to the wood and do use a second<br/>
piece of wood on the front.  It can still slide, so be<br/>
careful when positioning the stamp.  I just use<br/>
Crafter's Goop...seems to work find so far.<br/>
