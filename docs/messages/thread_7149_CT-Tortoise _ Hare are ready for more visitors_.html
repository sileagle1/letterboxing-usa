full logs books with new ones just ready and waiting for more <br/>
visitors!  I also carved a new "Hare" since a previous message <br/>
mentioned that his ear had come off.  That must have made a silly <br/>
stamp without the ear, sorry to all of you that have an image of an <br/>
earless hare!  Thank you to everyone that has visited these boxes, we <br/>
enjoyed reading all the kind words written in the full logbook.  <br/>
Letterboxers are a kind hearted group! <br/>
