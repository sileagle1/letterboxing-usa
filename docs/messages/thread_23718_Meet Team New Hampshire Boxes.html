Hampshire boxes. as we celebrate our 1 year anniversary, at home <br/>
recoverying still from a long invasion of Pennsylvania, we look <br/>
forward to many more years of boxing and meeting others. we have met <br/>
so many nice people and hit some bumps in the raoad as well. but it <br/>
sounds like we all do once and awhile. so we are fitting in just fine. <br/>
i know this post is a week late and we accually celebrated our 1 year <br/>
last week, but better late than never i suppose.<br/>
<br/>
if anyone wants a check out a review of our first year, check out my <br/>
blog at http://teamnewhampshire.blogspot.com<br/>
