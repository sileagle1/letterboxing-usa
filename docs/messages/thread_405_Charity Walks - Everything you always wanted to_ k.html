Thanks for compiling this information ! Very interesting.<br/>

At 02:54 PM 4/9/99 EDT, you wrote:<br/>
&gt;I queried privately about this subject with Rob and Graham,<br/>
&gt;and they were kind enough to reply in detail! We thought it might<br/>
&gt;be helpful for others as well, to see their answers compiled into<br/>
&gt;one post, so...<br/>
&gt;Following are some of the questions I asked and their answers,<br/>
&gt;which they have so graciously given me permission to share!<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;         *********<br/>
&gt;What is a charity walk?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And for me, the real question was what _isn't_ a charity walk!<br/>
&gt;I was getting confused thinking that the "walk" part was like<br/>
&gt;Walk/Runs for Charity in the US, where lots of people start<br/>
&gt;at the same place and time and end up at a finish line somewhere.<br/>
&gt;So, thanks to Rob and Graham, I now know that a letterboxing<br/>
&gt;charity walk is an event in which clues for a specific number of<br/>
&gt;letterboxes which are hidden for a certain amount of time along<br/>
&gt;a  specific route, and the people who purchase the clues go<br/>
&gt;a-hunting at their own time and pace.<br/>
&gt;&gt;From Graham:<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;...a set of clues usually in a circle or figure of eight ...<br/>
&gt;  from a good car park..ideally with a diner / coffee stop ...and<br/>
&gt;  you just have a ready made afternoon or days outing...<br/>
&gt;  and if the  planner has done a good job..it will take you<br/>
&gt;  (typically) between 5 and 10 miles over some nice countryside../ <br/>
&gt;  locations..and you'll find between six and 26 stamps ..! ...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  The charity thing is that the organiser charges say $3  for a copy<br/>
&gt;  of the list to raise money for some good cause...You usually get<br/>
&gt;  a special extra stamp..on a post card as the "bonus" stamp...<br/>
&gt;  The Scouts do it quite a bit..also one last season was for a <br/>
&gt;  Marching Band to get new instruments.often its for Health<br/>
&gt;  things like childrens care..or cancer research etc...&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;From Rob:<br/>
&gt;   &gt;&gt;In the UK there are loads of Dartmoor charity letterbox<br/>
&gt;   walks and many of them will be on sale at the six monthly<br/>
&gt;   meeting of the Letterbox Club...<br/>
&gt;   At the last meeting, I sold about 200 copies of the walk, <br/>
&gt;   so it can be very good for charities.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	******<br/>
&gt;I asked Graham about what goes into making a good walk...<br/>
&gt;and he replied with several factors that should be considered to<br/>
&gt;make the walk successful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Who?<br/>
&gt;    The walk should be designed with a specific participant in mind,<br/>
&gt;     or at least with consideration for the groups/people that might <br/>
&gt;     be most interested in participating.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     &gt;&gt;*maybe just for kids.. (If it's for kids they need success <br/>
&gt;           and if the boxes are too hard then they'll get disillusioned.)<br/>
&gt;         *maybe family groups ..<br/>
&gt;         *maybe cryptic hounds..<br/>
&gt;         *maybe mobility disadvantaged folk...<br/>
&gt;         *maybe its a "rainy day walk"..so the clues are / can <br/>
&gt;           be done from a car ..only a short distance from legal <br/>
&gt;           parking spots..say..  or<br/>
&gt;         *maybe its for real top of the tree smarty boxers.....<br/>
&gt;           who are really into a long trek with difficult finds and a<br/>
&gt;           great whole day out in wind and rain and all !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2.) Once you've decided which participants will most enjoy<br/>
&gt;the walk, you must decide other factors based on this decision....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  A. How long? (distance, time needed)<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;  B. Where? What terrain?<br/>
&gt;    &gt;&gt;If you like a long walk in the open air a two mile walk is poor...<br/>
&gt;        if you have arthritis it's a good effort!&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;    &gt;&gt;If its a rainy day walk ..well it must actually work and be<br/>
&gt;        fun from a car too !  &lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  D. Refreshment stops?<br/>
&gt;    &gt;&gt; I have done one walk that is all in local shops !..<br/>
&gt;        Not actually *counted* in Moor stamps though !!!! <br/>
&gt;        It's done for the local tourist board and you get a free <br/>
&gt;       coke or ice cream if you get three shoe shops or two pubs <br/>
&gt;       or similar..its a fun idea for the week of the local county show...&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  E. The letterboxes?<br/>
&gt;       With the prospective participants in mind....<br/>
&gt;       &gt;&gt;...how are they hidden...<br/>
&gt;	    are they plugged or stone covered or just plain <br/>
&gt;          in funny places..&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  F. The clues?<br/>
&gt;      &gt;&gt;are they easy, cryptic, with grid references or without..<br/>
&gt;          written as a "recipe" for kids to follow or some other <br/>
&gt;          dimension...&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3. What other considerations or options are there?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   A. Themes for boxes and clues<br/>
&gt;        &gt;&gt;...you need a theme and all the stamps need to comply..<br/>
&gt;           eg I'm putting out a "Creepy Crawl"  of insects on Dartmoor<br/>
&gt;           this week, also an "Easter Bunnies Hop"  with silly rabbit <br/>
&gt;           cartoons..only for the holiday 2 weeks that one..there are <br/>
&gt;           boxes in pairs..one at 90 degrees to the other...hence "HOP"..<br/>
&gt;           but clues to only one and no suggestion which 90 degrees <br/>
&gt;           it is !  eg N-S-E-W...My son is doing "Little Lost Sheep"...all<br/>
&gt;           the stamps are sheep in various reposes....cartoons again ...&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;          (The description for this one of Graham's is not for a walk.... <br/>
&gt;           but I thought the theme and the "process" for letterboxing <br/>
&gt;           in general so fascinating I repeat it here!) <br/>
&gt;          &gt;&gt;I am working on a history of the "Dartmoor Ponies" for a<br/>
&gt;	    summer *set* in August when I check all my boxes eg...<br/>
&gt;          with pit ponies and those working pulling trains and those <br/>
&gt;          going around and around all day working stone crushers  etc <br/>
&gt;          etc..I expect to build this up over say 3 years and then <br/>
&gt;          collect em in... &lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   B. A reward for completion<br/>
&gt;       &gt;&gt;Is there a prize?!   maybe if you send in all the stamps<br/>
&gt;        on a special card you buy with your own stamp you will get<br/>
&gt;        a patch...some do that too ! and maybe a special bonus <br/>
&gt;        stamp in the centre of your own card which is returned...&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   C. Length of time boxes are out<br/>
&gt;       &gt;&gt;Time is a dimension because the Moor will get worn <br/>
&gt;       if they are out too long..so 3 to 6 months is average..though<br/>
&gt;       there are Easter walks and Christmas walks just out for a few <br/>
&gt;       days..12 days of Xmas walk for example...<br/>
&gt;           Also if the walk is limited the stamp values are quite <br/>
&gt;       special...not in money only rarity value to other boxers to look<br/>
&gt;       at and go ooohh ! the famous 1999 L-USA set.... &lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  C. The fate of the stamps<br/>
&gt;        &gt;&gt;...they are nearly always taken in ...and destroyed !&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  D. The pitfalls and some solutions<br/>
&gt;        Rob wrote: &gt;&gt; ....charity walks are not always plain sailing.<br/>
&gt;       There are some individuals over here who take delight in <br/>
&gt;       stealing one of the boxes on a walk.  I guess it's to ensure<br/>
&gt;       that no one else ever completes it.  I've already heard that one <br/>
&gt;       of my boxes is missing after only 2 weeks on the moor. <br/>
&gt;       I'll be out this weekend to verify it.  It pays to have 2 copies<br/>
&gt;       of each stamp so that you have a backup if any go missing.<br/>
&gt;        At the very least, we keep hard copies of each so that we can<br/>
&gt;       send one to anyone who hasen't completed a walk.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;	*********<br/>
&gt;Here is an excerpt from a description for a current walk<br/>
&gt;organized by Rob that he sent as an attachment to those<br/>
&gt;who asked (I left out the locale and the clues):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;...ICE SKATING CLUB WALK  SPRING 1999...<br/>
&gt;....about 2 miles long and is suitable for children.<br/>
&gt;The boxes have all been hidden in existing holes or natural <br/>
&gt;places of concealment with minimal extra camouflage in order<br/>
&gt;to protect the environment. The boxes are not near any Hut Circles,<br/>
&gt;Cairns or other monuments in the area.  Please avoid over zealous<br/>
&gt;searching and replace boxes where you find them.  The bearings<br/>
&gt;were all taken using a hand compass so may not be accurate.<br/>
&gt;All  proceeds from this walk will go to....&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;[There are a total of 20 boxes]<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Thank you for your support.  This walk will be taken off the <br/>
&gt;moor in October... If you have any problems please contact... &lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;About the walk, Rob later wrote to me to say that they had made<br/>
&gt;for the club almost 300; which translated into 150 groups going out<br/>
&gt;on the walk with more to come after advertising in a weekly Letterbox<br/>
&gt;Newsletter.<br/>
