<br/>
Its only 9 days away from Saturday 8-10-02 and time for our Pacific NW <br/>
Letterboxing event.  Woohoo!   I'm getting excited about it!   <br/>
<br/>
Funhog said I could be the direction gal.  I've not been there myself, which <br/>
is why I've done a bunch of research.  I'm checking the park out this weekend <br/>
and will let you know if I discover anything new.  Below is what I know (and <br/>
Funhog confirms that I am on the right track):<br/>
<br/>
Upper Macleay Part is part of the much larger Forest Park.  Its the far south <br/>
map you want to look at.  (There are 5 maps total.)  Please note that the map <br/>
is oriented with North in the upper left corner: <br/>
<a href="http://explorepdx.com/forpark5.html">Forest Park far south</a><br/>
<a href="http://explorepdx.com/forpark.html">Forest Park Index Map</a> <br/>
<br/>
One possible route is:<br/>
--First find directions to W Burnside and NW 23rd.  <br/>
--From there head North on NW 23rd.  The street names in this area of NW <br/>
Portland are all alphabetical.  (i.e. Burnside, Couch, Davis, Everett etc.)<br/>
--Turn left on Lovejoy, the "L" street.<br/>
--Lovejoy automatically becomes Cornell.  (See this area in the "Far South" <br/>
map).  <br/>
--The park is on the left!<br/>
<br/>
Remember, we are meeting at UPPER Macleay Park, which is to the right of <br/>
Cornell when you look at the map. (Don't confuse it with Lower Macleay Park <br/>
which is more well-known.)  Funhog says, "Also, the Audubon House is just <br/>
west of Upper Macleay Park.  Many trails diverge from this point and that's <br/>
why we picked it instead of the lower one which has but one."  Sounds good to <br/>
me!<br/>
<br/>
Please ask if you have any questions.  Hope to see you there.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay!  I made it to Upper Macleay Park.  Its a perfect spot for a <br/>
letterboxing event next Saturday!!  (Y'all picked good.)<br/>
<br/>
Just to give anyone who hasn't been there some additional observations:<br/>
<br/>
NW 23th Ave will take you through a very popular part of uptown Portland with <br/>
lots of shops, cafes and pubs.   Its a walkers paradise.  On Cornell Road <br/>
notice the beautiful houses.  Everything looks like it was build at least 100 <br/>
years ago.  Lots of stone work along the road.  You will pass under two <br/>
tunnels.  Don't be like me, so busy looking at the beauty around me that I <br/>
missed the turn-in to the park.   The Upper Macleay PARK is on the RIGHT side <br/>
as you come from downtown Portland, but the Upper Macleay TRAIL is on the <br/>
LEFT side.   (Hence my original confusion). <br/>
<br/>
The park itself sits along Cornell road, about 200 yards long(?).  There <br/>
appears to be only two picnic tables, one at each end.  So, heed Funhog's <br/>
advice and bring a chair or two.  Throw a folder in the back of the trunk if <br/>
you can!  <br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to see everybody who will be there!  Funhog, lets have a roll <br/>
call.  Who all is coming??<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Ack!  I have been corrected!  Funhog says, "Looks good except for one <br/>
pesky detail. The park is on the right as you come from downtown. eek!!!"  &gt;&gt;<br/>
