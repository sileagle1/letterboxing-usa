Dearest John,<br/>
<br/>
My heart is with you at this very moment as I sit down to write this<br/>
letter. I hope that you will take this opportunity to articulate the<br/>
importance of this day.  I am also relieved that despite the previous<br/>
events leading up to your speech that your address can take place in<br/>
Philadelphia rather than having to move the legislature.  I do wish<br/>
that those who have been afflicted have been privy to better wellness.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you that although the current discussion with the French<br/>
has taken a direction towards progress, I believe we must remain<br/>
focused on the state of our commerce in this country. As I read<br/>
through your words that you have prepared for the State of the Union<br/>
address, the thoughts you spoke regarding the established Indian lands<br/>
resonated.  I do believe that the recent events of the Passamaquoddy<br/>
Bay meeting last October have resulted in a resolution of the St.<br/>
Croix river survey but you are correct to allow more time for the<br/>
commisssioners to complete this analysis.  Furthermore, it is a wise<br/>
decision to postpone the next meeting until June in Providence.  The<br/>
weather is starting to turn much colder and I fear that many of our<br/>
fall crops might not sustain us through the winter months.<br/>
<br/>
As I also think towards the long, dark and lonely nights ahead I wish<br/>
that we were together on this day, my birthday. I do long for the<br/>
quiet times where we were able to discuss these matters in<br/>
confidentiality. Please remember that you have a duty to fulfill your<br/>
position as our leader, however as I look back on the last fifty three<br/>
years that I have experienced, I count each blessing for it has<br/>
provided me with the wisdom and insight that I need to continue.<br/>
<br/>
I think of you always.<br/>
Most fondly, your faithful wife -<br/>
<br/>
Abigail<br/>

Oh no, not another "Dear John" letter!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I heard 'he plays the violin' even 'tucks it right under his <br/>
chin'...<br/>
<br/>
On a more serious note, thank you John for your myriad sacrifices <br/>
during your lifetime that helped birth this great nation.  May your <br/>
separation from Abigail be short lived.<br/>

P.S.  Did Abigail ever get the saltpeter that she requested in <br/>
previous letters???  What about the sewing needles &amp; pins?  ;)<br/>

Yes, thanks for the correction.  Realized that later on (after a long <br/>
day of cooking a T-day meal a day early just so we'd have leftovers <br/>
because we're heading elsewhere for Tday)--hey, if we said what <br/>
everybody really wanted John to do (sit down) we'd probably be <br/>
encouraged to go elsewhere with the chatter, eh?  So, did John write <br/>
back?  ;)  Wonder if this is tied to a LB?  Can't wait to find out...<br/>
