<div>I read an interesting article in a magazine called Outdoor 
Retailer. This is a magazine for the people who run and work in the outdoor 
retail market (such as myself). The front cover of the most recent issue of this 
magazine focuses on Geocaching and how it is growing by leaps and bounds and how 
there are some big names coming out to support it. Garmin, who makes the E-Trex 
line of GPS units is supporting Geocaching in a big way. The producers of the 
new movie coming out called Planet of the Apes are placing some of the movie 
props in Geocaches around the U.S. for the taking. Also mentioned in the article 
was a company called Brunton. Brunton makes a few electronic instruments similar 
to GPS and they also make some precision high-end compasses and measuring 
instruments as well. They are extremely interested in Letterboxing and from what 
the article says, they will be supporting it soon. I work for Eastern Mountain 
Sports who also sells Garmin and Brunton products. I will be seeking support 
from EMS to include Letterboxing in as many stores as possible. It has been 
great for our store and it will open  up more clue possibilities for many 
states in the US.</div>
