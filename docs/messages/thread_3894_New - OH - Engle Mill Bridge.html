Difficulty: 1 (Drive by)<br/>
Near Spring Valley, Greene County, OH<br/>
Placed 7 December 2001 by<br/>

<br/>
This is the 5th and last covered bridge in Greene County.  If you <br/>
have covered the boxes named "Covered Bridge," Massies Creek <br/>
Bridges," "Ballard Road Bridge" and this box you have the entire <br/>
set.  <br/>
<br/>
To get to the bridge, take 380 south out of Xenia for several miles <br/>
until it intersects with Spring Valley  Paintersville Road.  Turning <br/>
east, proceed 1.9 miles to Engle Mill Road.  As you approach the <br/>
bridge, there is a turn off just before the bridge on the left side <br/>
of the road.  <br/>
<br/>
The box is on the other side of the bridge.  Walk over the parallel <br/>
modern bridge and cross the grass to the south end of the covered <br/>
bridge.  Turn to 140 degrees and take 4 paces.  At the foot of the <br/>
tree, the box is under 2 rocks.  <br/>
