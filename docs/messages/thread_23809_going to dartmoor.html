I am certain that these kind folks would be more than happy to share <br/>
some of their experiences.  Mark even wrote up his crew's adventure <br/>
in his blog, pointing out some of the subtle differences in boxing <br/>
hither and tither.  Be prepared for very high box concntrations in <br/>
specific areas.<br/>

If you only have time to do one thing, and the weather is good, I<br/>
would say do Cranmere Pool. After all, it is the original letterbox. A<br/>
bit of history. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to scramble all over a tor and find a bunch of letterboxes<br/>
by scavenging, then Pew Tor was our most successful day with 44<br/>
letterboxes found in that area alone!<br/>

Cranmere because of the firing schedule.  That day, of course, was<br/>
incredibly foggy and wet...it was quite an adventure.<br/>
