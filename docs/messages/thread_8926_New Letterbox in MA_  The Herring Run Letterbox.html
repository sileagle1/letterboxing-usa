The HERRING RUN LETTERBOX: Bourne, MA (Barnstable County)<br/>

Most of us do not consider the alewife part of our regular diets <br/>
today, but in Colonial times they were a prize catch.  Native <br/>
Americans taught the early colonists to use them as fertilizer in <br/>
their gardens.  It is said that colonists used a "barrel per <br/>
household" over the course of a year.  In addition to being used for <br/>
fertilizer, they were also used as bait, and were smoked and dried<br/>
for eating over the long winters.  Alewives, or Alosa psuedoharengus, <br/>
are members of the herring family, and have traditionally been among <br/>
the most abundant fish in the world.  Some people believe that their <br/>
name came from the fact that their large bellies make them look like<br/>
female tavern keepers of Elizabethan England - hence "alewives".  They <br/>
are anadromous fish, meaning that although they live in the ocean for<br/>
most of their adult lives, they return to the fresh water stream or <br/>
pond in which they were born to spawn.  In order to do so, they must <br/>
travel upstream, not only fighting the direction of the water's flow, <br/>
but in some cases jumping up over fish ladders and rocks.<br/>
<br/>
When they reach their home ponds, the female alewives will lay up to <br/>
100,000 eggs.  Any adults that survive the trip home, and any <br/>
predators along the way (such as gulls and man) return to the sea.  <br/>
After hatching, the fry live in the freshwater ponds until fall, when <br/>
they follow the path of the adults and got to the sea.  The<br/>
definitive book about the migration of these anadromous fish is "The <br/>
Run", by John Hay of Brewster, MA.<br/>
<br/>
The Bournedale Herring Run, in Bourne, MA is an artificial<br/>
watercourse created by local engineers after the building of the canal <br/>
destroyed the natural run into Herring Pond.  Park in the large lot at <br/>
the Herring run Recreation Area on the mainland side of the Canal, <br/>
which is roughly halfway between the Bourne and Sagamore Bridges on <br/>
Route 6 at the traffic light.  The fish ladder lies to the west of the<br/>
Visitor Center (and rest room) facility here.  At the base of the <br/>
ladder next to where it leaves the canal and begins its climb up to <br/>
Herring Pond, there is a descriptive sign with a lot of information <br/>
about man's historical and present day uses of alewives.  <br/>
<br/>
After boning up on alewife information, travel west on the canal <br/>
access path for a short distance to the entrance of the Bournedale <br/>
Interpretive Nature Trial, which leaves the paved access path to the <br/>
right.  The first interpretive sign that you'll pass describes the red <br/>
cedar tree.  After passing this sign, the trail navigates a bend with <br/>
a lookout over the canal to your left.  When you spy the trunk of a <br/>
small pine tree in the center of the trail, look to your north for a <br/>
fallen log. Your prize lies under the northeastern end of the log.  <br/>
<br/>
After stamping in, you can continue westward along the trail for <br/>
several miles enjoying periodic views of the canal and learning about <br/>
a number of different local plant specimens.  The trail eventually <br/>
ends at the Bourne Scenic Park just before you reach the Bourne <br/>
Bridge.  Return to the parking lot as you came from any point on the <br/>
trail, or climb up to several scenic vistas, or down to the canal <br/>
access path and turn eastward for your return.<br/>
