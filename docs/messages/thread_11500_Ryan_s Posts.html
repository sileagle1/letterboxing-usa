Out of curiosity, I just did a search of Yahoo Groups for any board <br/>
with "Letterbox" in the title, and found the following boards:<br/>
<br/>
letterbox-oki (Ohio Kentucky and Indiana Letterboxing)<br/>
letterbox-ak <br/>
letterbox-ct <br/>
letterbox-fl<br/>
letterbox-ky<br/>
letterbox-me<br/>
letterbox-vt<br/>
letterbox-co<br/>
letterbox-al<br/>
letterbox-ca<br/>
letterbox-mo<br/>
letterbox-nc<br/>
letterbox-oh<br/>
letterbox-md<br/>
letterbox-ma<br/>
letterbox-ny<br/>
letterbox-ut<br/>
letterbox-wa<br/>
letterbox-vw<br/>
letterbox-technical (whatever that means)<br/>
letterbox_travellers<br/>
letterboxing-curious <br/>
Mischief_wa_lb (Looks like Mischief already has a <br/>
     "Master of Her Domain" place on the web!  =)<br/>
<br/>
There's a few others that popped up about rock bands and places to <br/>
meet pen-pals and such, but I've only listed the ones that I think <br/>
really do have something to do with our form of letterboxing.  =)<br/>
<br/>
It looks like most of those groups have VERY little activity--less <br/>
than five members and all the posts are junk mail from the couple <br/>
I've looked at.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow....  Food for thought.  =)  <br/>

These are ancient, and were set up when the original web site was set<br/>
up.  In practice, no one thought they were a good idea, or at least<br/>
very few people signed up for them and used them at the time.  Of course, <br/>
in those days, there were about 20 people or so total in Amercian <br/>
letterboxing.  I believe Mitch was the owner of some of them, and various <br/>
people around the country are the owners of the rest of them, people who <br/>
may no longer be active.  I was the owner of the -pa one, but gave that <br/>
over to someone else years ago.<br/>

<br/>
This was the old webmaster list that was open to anyone who wanted to<br/>
contribute technical ideas to developing the website.  For historical <br/>
reasons, this fell into disuse.  Its prolly still open, and has a <br/>
handful of boring messages, or perhaps its active (yahoo generally <br/>
deletes groups after some period of inactivity, so either these groups <br/>
are getting spam, or someone is keeping them alive).  I believe Mitch <br/>
is the owner of this one as well.<br/>
