The info on my hitchhikers tells both placer and finder to ensure that the LB it resides is/is dropped off in places that stamp in it.<br/>

  *This message was transferred with a trial version of CommuniGate(tm) Pro* Hi all, Newbie here.<br/>
<br/>
  Found a hitch hiker my first day, second box.  I'm such a newbie, <br/>
  that when I found the HHiker I shoved it in my pack. I figured all <br/>
  that needed to be done should be done elsewhere.  Like I should try <br/>
  to keep it a big secret.  So I drove a mile away (couldn't take it <br/>
  anymore), opened it up and saw that it said to put the LBox stamp in <br/>
  the HHiker log.  So went back to LBox.  Now with further <br/>
  thought/research I realize I need to put the HHiker stamp in the LBox <br/>
  log.  It's quite a public place too and I'll be on my third visit to <br/>
  the Lbox.  Feel like I need a flowchart to remember all the steps ;)<br/>
<br/>
  I have a question about the next step, regarding who should do the <br/>
  exchange of stamps, the dropper offer or the picker uper?  I'm the <br/>
  3rd to receive the HHiker and noone has put the stamps from the <br/>
  LBox's in there, (not even the creator).  They've only put their <br/>
  personal stamps in there.<br/>
<br/>
  A FAQ said that the one who drops off the HH should do the exchange <br/>
  but my HHiker says who finds it should do the exchange.  Also should <br/>
  I put my stamp in the LBox log on the SAME page as the HHiker stamp, <br/>
  showing I found it?  Likewise, do I put my stamp along with the LBox <br/>
  stamp on the SAME page in the HHiker log showing I found it at ----- ?<br/>
<br/>
  It's very addictive and time consuming to start this LBoxing project <br/>
  up.  Between researching clues, FAQs, listserv posts and making <br/>
  materials.  <br/>
<br/>
  Today we found Paddle to the Sea, N. Windham, CT.  Should of taken <br/>
  1/2 hour but totting little ones around took 1 and 1/2 hours.<br/>
