                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>I've got a question for the list on the subject of hitchhikers. We went out again today, and during our travels, we came upon our second HH. Are we supposed to stamp the box that we found it in into it's log, as well as our stamp, or just our stamp? We've found two HHs so far, and neither of them had the stamps of the box they were in, or where they had been, but most of the people who found them also wrote on the logbook where they found it. So which way is it supposed to be?

<br/>
Why not both?  Why not just have a stamp frenzy?  I've never come across a <br/>
hitchhiker myself, but that each log would get 2 stamp images seems <br/>
reasonable:  You get two, the hitchhiker gets two and main letterbox gets <br/>
two.  Works for me.  <br/>
<br/>
What is it that Funhog likes to say, "Remember, there are no rules."  I think <br/>
of that being tempered with a sense of reasonableness, but I like the intent. <br/>
 So, if it feels right, do it!<br/>
<br/>
Hah!  Maybe mine is not the best advice . . .   I've only been letterboxing <br/>
since April!<br/>
<br/>
happy boxing!<br/>

planted, that's what we where looking for.  For the person to stamp <br/>
both their personal stamp and the box stamp they took it to.  When we <br/>
start a hitchhiking letterbox, we stamp the launch box into it as a <br/>
guide for future finders to follow.  But hey that's just how we did <br/>
it, other people may have set up their boxes diffrently.  Have fun.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, please please please stamp both the hitcher into the host box <br/>
logbook and the host box stamp into the hitcher logbook, as well as <br/>
your own personal stamps into both boxes! That way there is a  record <br/>
of not only who has found a particular hitcher, but also where each <br/>
hitcher has managed to get to in its travels, which is often very <br/>
interesting  both to its owner and to any others who enjoy following <br/>
hitchers past travels. We try to keep up on this on our hitcher <br/>
tracking list at the bottom of our webpage, but it is very difficult <br/>
to maintain with any accuracy, what with the limited info we get from <br/>
postings,etc.,so we appreciate any additions, corrections, or <br/>
whatever that folks send us! Thanks,<br/>
