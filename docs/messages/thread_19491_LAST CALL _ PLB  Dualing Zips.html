There are currently 50 requests --- and since this is only a test, <br/>
the list will be halved and TWO SETS of Mr. ZIPz will be issued to <br/>
expedite the completion of the test (hopefully within one year).<br/>
<br/>
I hope to have these on their way next week.<br/>

&gt; While chatting with sewsowbizzy about her PLB Apologies . . . , she <br/>
&gt; asked how important the ZIP+4 was in the mailing addresses, since <br/>
&gt; only one other person had provided those extra 4 digits.   I was <br/>
&gt; intrigued that folks expecting a POSTAL Letterbox would not think <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; insure its speedy delivery by providing a full and complete mailing <br/>
&gt; address.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Alas, I could not give her a specific response.  But I can test the <br/>
&gt; system with a new dual PLB.  That's correct, two PLB's mailed <br/>
&gt; simultaneously to each person requesting entry on to the mailing <br/>
&gt; list.  <br/>
&gt; They will be named : <br/>
&gt;       PLB Zip-a-dee-do-dah  (with ZIP+4) <br/>
&gt;       PLB Zip-a-dee-ay      (with just the ZIP  - 5 digit)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only requirement is that ALL requested entries must include the <br/>
&gt; address with ZIP+4.  If you do not know yours, you can go to <br/>
&gt; www.usps.com and click on "Find a Zip Code" --- or just check your <br/>
&gt; bulk mail, it should already be in the address.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When each box is received enter in the log book both the date it <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; received and the date it is mailed on to the next recipient.  Wait <br/>
&gt; until BOTH PLBs are received before mailing them both out at the <br/>
same <br/>
&gt; time.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Each PLB will be in a Large Envelope and weigh 9oz or less so it <br/>
can <br/>
&gt; be sent via FIRST CLASS MAIL - no Priority Mailings please.  <br/>
&gt; www.usps.com shows a cross country run should take 3 days and cost <br/>
&gt; $2.21 per PLB (DC to CA or DC to VA, the price is the same.)  But <br/>
&gt; feel free to put six - $0.37 stamps on each envelope.  That is <br/>
still <br/>
&gt; less than a gallon of gas in some states - and can go much <br/>
further.  <br/>
&gt; But I will try to make it as light and sturdy as possible, so it <br/>
may <br/>
&gt; come in at under $2.21.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This request list will be open thru July 17, 2004.<br/>
