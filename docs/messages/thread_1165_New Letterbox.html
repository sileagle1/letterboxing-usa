<div> <strong>[Webmaster</strong>: 
please add these clues to LBNA website, this box was placed on 8/27/00 by Debbie 
Cade, Annie Burton, and Evelyn Mckenna ...aka.."the elements of hiking"..I 
believe that Branford is in the New Haven area, along I95..thanks so much for 
you help<strong>]</strong>
<p><strong>Golden Thread 
Letterbox</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>* Difficulty: one 
letterbox on an easy stroll in a somewhat quite commercial area.</p>
<p>* Location:<span>  
</span>Branford, Connecticut.</p>
<p>* Directions:<span>  
</span>Take Route 95 to exit 54.<span>  
</span>Follow signs to Route 1 South.<span>  
</span>From the intersection, drive 2 miles to<span>   </span>the Branford Hill Plaza parking 
area on the left (across from McDonald’s).<span>  
</span>Your stay should be a short one so parking here shouldn’t be a 
problem.</p>
<p> This letterbox was brought about by an assignment given 
to a student of the Branford Hall Career Institute, and inspired by the 
following poem:</p>
<h1>The Plan of the Master Weaver</h1>
<p align="center"> <em>Our lives are but fine 
weavings</em></p>
<p align="center"><i>That God and we 
prepare,<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = 
"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Each life becomes 
a fabric planned<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>And fashioned in 
his care.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>We may not always 
see just how <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>The weavings 
intertwine,<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>But we must trust 
the Master’s hand<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>And follow His 
design,<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>For He can view 
the pattern<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Upon the upper 
side,<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>While we must look 
from underneath <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>And trust in Him 
to guide…</i></p>
<p align="center"><i><o:p></o:p></i> </p>
<p align="center"><i> </i><em>Sometimes a strand 
of sorrow</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>Is added to His 
plan,</em><o:p></o:p></p>
<p align="center"><i>And though it’s 
difficult for us,<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>We still must 
understand<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>That it’s He who 
fills the shuttle,<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>It’s He who knows 
what’s best,<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>So we must weave 
in patience<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>And leave to Him 
the rest…<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i> <o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Not till the loom 
is silent<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>And the shuttles 
cease to fly<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Shall God unroll 
the canvas<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>And explain the 
reason why—<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>The dark threads 
are as needed<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>In the Weaver’s 
skillful hand<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>As the threads of 
gold and silver<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p align="center"><i>In the pattern He 
has planned.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p> Your quest today begins at the entrance to the Halls of 
greater learning.<span>  </span>From this point, 
take a bearing of 240<span><span></span></span> 
and proceed beyond the hallowed Halls of Branford.<span>  </span>Ascend the steps of higher 
education.<span>  </span>Bearing 110<span><span></span></span>, 
stroll past 13 guardians to the twins.<span>  
</span>If this hasn’t drained you too much, head in that direction to a warmer 
climate.<span>  </span>Proceed along the path 
lined by more guardians to a place where you could be pointed in either 
direction.<span>  </span>Look toward the rising 
sun to find a lone sentinel.<span>  </span>Your 
goal is resting, nestled at his feet under a trap door.<span>  </span>Take a moment and weave this golden 
thread into the tapestry of your life.</p></div></body></html>

<br/>
<br/></b></p><p align="LEFT"></p>(This trail can be done as ashort bike ride, or a nice hike on paved walkways)
<br/>
<br/>Make your way to the GeneseeValley Park, just northeast of where I-390 crosses the Genesee River.  Start your letterbox adventure from the“Roundhouse” Pavilion.  Stand in thecenter of the pavilion and look towards the Genesee River.  Make this direction 12 o’clock.  Now make your way towards 9 o’clock and goto the “Canalside” Pavilion.  Continuepast the pavilion and go towards the Erie Canal and you’ll see your firstbridge, just a short distance away. Cross this bridge, but pause at the top and look left.  You will see an abandoned railway bridge (2)and after that a lock on the canal. (You may wish to visit later.) Finish crossing this bridge, take a hard right at the end, and then aquick left to go under the two I-390 bridges (3&amp;4).  After going under these, take your firstright and cross the bridge (5) over Red Creek, which flows into the ErieCanal.  Continue straight and go backunder the two highway bridges.  Looktowards your right for a trail that goes back over the Erie Canal.  Cross this bridge (6).  At the end, continue straight ahead, and ina few paces you will see a bridge that goes left and across the GeneseeRiver.  Take this bridge (7) and pauseat the top – look left and you will see the crossroad of the Genesee River andthe Erie Canal!  At the end of thisbridge, turn left and proceed down the Genesee River Trail.  In 1/10th of a mile, the pathwill “T”; turn left.  In a short way youwill see your next bridge (8).  At thetop of this bridge, look right and you’ll see another old abandoned bridge (9)and the new Scottsville Road Bridge (10). At the end of the bridge you are standing on, begin counting your paces,starting at the three yellow iron posts. Walk straight for 60 paces.  Stopand turn left, walking off the path and towards the river.  In the brush, you will see several largeconcrete blocks.  Look between thecracks and you will find the letterbox – <b>Have a great day!</b>

Location: Washington County, Pennsylvania<br/>
Closest Town: Wind Ridge (Greene County)<br/>
Submitted By: Sarsaparilla<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Road Directions:<br/>
To get to Enlow Fork Natural Area from I-79, take Exit 14 (old Exit 3),<br/>
then follow Route 21 West through Waynesburg to Wind Ridge. At the eastern<br/>
edge of Wind Ridge, turn north to follow Nebo Ridge Road for about 3 miles.<br/>
Make a right onto Walker Hill Road, then left onto Smokey Row, a gravel<br/>
road that winds down into the valley. Keep to right until you come to<br/>
roads end at creek side. Park in grassy lot. Motorized vehicles are<br/>
prohibited beyond that point. Enter emergency roadway on foot.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Hike or bike the old roadway.<br/>
In field or wood, do not stray.<br/>
In spring of year, you may see<br/>
Flowers wild: blue-eyed Mary,<br/>
Larkspur, phlox, geranium,<br/>
Fire pinks, Bluebells, and trillium. <br/>
Keep the course and you will find<br/>
A bridge, the iron-grated kind.<br/>
In twenty-two paces cross<br/>
Or the cache will be a loss.<br/>
Start to count to 219<br/>
Or the spot will go unseen.  <br/>
In "S"-shaped curve, look to right<br/>
But do not tread or you might<br/>
Step on Jack-in-the-Pulpits<br/>
Resting neath rock precipice.<br/>
At the end of 219,<br/>
Look to your right, being keen<br/>
To behold the twin-trunked tree<br/>
With knothole base forming the<br/>
Chamber for the treasure chest.<br/>
25 paces will end your quest.<br/>

  [mailto:Beaverpeople@aol.com]<br/><b>Sent:</b> Friday, July 12, 2002 2:48 
  PM<br/><b>To:</b> letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com<br/><b>Subject:</b> New 
  Letterbox<br/><br/></div><br/>This box was placed by "The Beaver People" on 
  Thursday, July 4, 2002. It is located on the Bristol Hills Spur Trail of the 
  Finger Lakes Trail System in the town of South Bristol, Ontario County, New 
  York. The nearest village is Naples, NY. <br/>The box is accessible from two 
  directions; one is challenging but rewarding; the second is shorter and is 
  over terrain that is less difficult. <br/>The "Scenic Route": <br/>Drive to 
  ONTARIO COUNTY PARK located on NY Route 64 near the hamlet of Bristol Springs. 
  Drive about 1 mile from the park sign on Rt. 64 . Turn right into the park and 
  drive past the camping area. You will come to a parking area with a sign in 
  the middle of the road indicating PICNIC area to the left and the Finger Lakes 
  Trail and "Jump OFF" to the right. Park here and take the ORANGE blazed trail. 
  You will very soon come to a water spigot in the middle of the trail where you 
  can fill your water bottle. You will pass some spectacular views of the valley 
  below, pass lush vegetation including wild blueberry bushes and hike through 
  cool deciduous forest through hilly terrain for about 2.5 miles. The ORANGE 
  blazed trail is intersected by many other trails in this area so stay alert. 
  After you come to an intersection with a BLUE blazed trail going to a camping 
  area, you will stay on the ORANGE blazed trail and cross a footbridge over a 
  small stream. You will shortly see a large Beaver Pond on the right. Look for 
  a large hemlock tree on your right, right on the shore of the pond. There is a 
  trail register box on this tree. It is your reference point to find our 
  letterbox. <br/>THE EASY ROUTE: <br/>Get on WEST HOLLOW ROAD (County Road 33) 
  where it intersects with County Road 34. Take it about 2.1 miles south. You 
  will pass an abandoned ski area on your right. There is a parking lot about a 
  mile beyond the ski area. Walk from the parking lot and cross the road. 
  Proceed south (right) about 60 paces. You will see a green and yellow FLT 
  sign. There is barn red flat roofed shed in the field next to it. Take this 
  trail for a bit less than a mile. You will first cross over an extensive board 
  walk and then skirt a large meadow. The trail meanders, eventually turning 
  down a fairly steep but short hill to a small stream. Cross the stream on the 
  footbridge and follow the ORANGE blazes to your left. You will soon see our 
  Beaver Pond. The large hemlock with the Trail Register is about 100 paces down 
  the trail beyond the Beaver Dam. It is your reference point for finding our 
  letterbox. <br/>FINDING THE BOX: <br/>Facing the Trail Register, walk on the 
  trail to your left about 18 paces. You should be between a large oak tree with 
  old beaver chewing on your left, and a small elm tree on your right. With your 
  back to the oak, go 110 degrees up the slight hill toward a maple tree about 
  8-10 inches in diameter. At its base is a large split rock. Within the split, 
  covered with leaves and twigs is our Treasure Box. <br/><br/>Gary and Penny Shaw

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello!  We're brand new to letterboxing and hopefully we wont make <br/>
any glaring errors as we start out.  <br/>
<br/>
While we were looking at the letterboxing.org site, we noticed that <br/>
there werent any boxes listed in our area - so we decided to start <br/>
placing our own in the hopes of inspiring our local homeschooling <br/>
community.  So, here goes:<br/>
<br/>
Allerton Letterbox <br/>
<br/>
This box is located at Allerton Park <br/>
(http://www.conted.uiuc.edu/allerton/) just outside of Monticello, <br/>
Illinois.<br/>
<br/>
Help finding landmarks can be found at the Visitor Center.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Put your back to the Buddhas and walk through the hall of Fu Dogs to <br/>
the forest path.  Travel the trail until you reach the fork and veer <br/>
left around the fish pond.  Sit on the right side of the bench facing <br/>
the pond.  Look to your left between the forked tree.  Spy the <br/>
singular tree with the oblong knothole.  Stand up and go look behind <br/>
the singular tree for the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!!<br/>

<br/>
Established: Sept. 21, 2002 by Frank Ierardi<br/>
<br/>
Location:<br/>
The Seneca Creek Trail letterbox is located in Montgomery County, MD.<br/>
<br/>
Nearest Town:  Darnestown<br/>
<br/>
Parking:  Park at Black Rock Mill located on Black Rock Road between Rt. 118 <br/>
and Rt. 28 where the road crosses Seneca Creek.<br/>
<br/>
Clue:<br/>
The Seneca Creek Trail runs upstream and down<br/>
To determine the way, the first clue is found<br/>
By using your head and solving this cipher,<br/>
Then hitting the trail, like a seasoned hiker.<br/>
<br/>
23 23 23 . 19 5 14 5 3 1 20 18 1 9 12 . 15 18 7 / 12 9 14 11 19 . 8 20 13<br/>
<br/>
I hope you like hiking, there's a mile to go<br/>
So tighten you boots and enjoy nature's show.<br/>
<br/>
Finally you've made it to the house of the troll<br/>
It's the 5th one, if you've been keeping a toll.<br/>
You must pass the troll, of that there's no question<br/>
Say, if he eats you he'll get indigestion.<br/>
<br/>
I thought you liked hiking when you started the day.<br/>
So onward you go, it's too late to say nay.<br/>
Climb up the steep hill, you'll huff and you'll puff<br/>
Till you stand on the top.  Have you had enough?<br/>
<br/>
Now look for the ring, it's not far from the trail<br/>
Or if you're too tired, why sit on your tail.<br/>
The ring is found by taking fifteen paces<br/>
Find the heading on the decimal bases<br/>
<br/>
The length of the troll's home multiplied by 10<br/>
Then perform a subtraction of 10 again.<br/>
