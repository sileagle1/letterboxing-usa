the number of *listings* in a state and expand upon that...<br/>
<br/>
Click on Search for Boxes, select a state, click Search.<br/>
You get the non-Mystery listings for that state.<br/>
Dump that to a .CSV file.<br/>
Open that in Excel. <br/>
Set the first "clean" cell in column H to equal the SUM of all the<br/>
H-column cells above it, and you have the number of BOXES.<br/>
