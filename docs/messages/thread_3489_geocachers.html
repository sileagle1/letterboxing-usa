<br/>
I'd say, "go for it" with certain conditions.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a seasoned Geocacher trying to get Letterboxing going in my area.  I've <br/>
placed about five geocaches in the Omaha area, two of which are also <br/>
letterboxes.  I'm hoping that the dual listing (listed on both <br/>
letterboxing.org and geocaching.com) will pique the interest of some other <br/>
geocachers.<br/>
<br/>
My idea is that geocaching appeals to the "geek nature" of people, while <br/>
letterboxing appeals to the "artistic nature."  I'm attracted to each for <br/>
similar and different reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I think as long as you (or the geocacher acting on your behalf) make sure <br/>
that the listing on the geocaching.com web site states that the site is a <br/>
letterbox and that there is no "stash" in the cache, and that a logbook and <br/>
stamp is all that will be found, you will be fine.  You might even win some <br/>
converts. :)<br/>
<br/>
With any new letterbox/geocaches sites, you could even include a stash, as <br/>
well as a stamp.  The seeker could either trade stash items or swap stamp <br/>
images, or even both.  You'd get the best of both worlds.<br/>
<br/>
On my letterboxing page (http://interbug.com/letterboxing), I give <br/>
traditional letterboxing clues to my letterboxes.  On the geocaching.com <br/>
site, my letterbox/geocache listings omit the clues, so as not to give away <br/>
the location (they have to use the geographic coordinates for that).  On <br/>
both places I link to the other, giving the seeker a choice as to which <br/>
manner he might seek the box.<br/>
<br/>
It's been a couple of weeks since I placed these new letterboxes, and <br/>
neither a geocacher nor letterboxer has informed me of its discovery.  I <br/>
may check up on them next week to see of someone found them but didn't <br/>
email me or log the finds on the web site.<br/>
<br/>
Regards...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is the point of my message, too, but I wanted to add that I still <br/>
think there's many occasions to have a stash-only geocache (with no stamp) <br/>
in the event that the terrain or theme is not suitable for letterbox <br/>
clues.  Conversely, I could also see when a letterbox-only site would be <br/>
more appropriate when you've got something extra special or mysterious <br/>
you'd want to reserve for letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
For standard geocaching/letterboxing, I will probably continue to combine <br/>
mine and list them on both sites.  My area (Omaha, Nebraska) doesn't have <br/>
any other letterboxes, and geocaches, too, are not as plentiful as in other <br/>
areas.<br/>
