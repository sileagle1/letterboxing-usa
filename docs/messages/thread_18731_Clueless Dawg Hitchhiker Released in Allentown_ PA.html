                    <div class="plaintext-content">The 'Clueless Dawg' Hitchhiker has been released in the Allentown, PA <br/>
area.  Think of the Clueless Dawg not as a normal Hitchhiker, but as <br/>
a loyal `Traveling Companion.'  That is, at least until he gets to <br/>
rest at your next Letterbox!  At that point, he'll be tired from <br/>
traveling and need to rest up in this Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The Clueless Dawg is known to be partial to Fishes and Planets in our <br/>
Solar System, but would be tickled pink to see more of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Please let the Clueless Dawg's buddy, Lightning Bug, know that you <br/>
have enjoyed his company and where he accompanied you.<br/>

Howdy....<br/>
<br/>
The Clueless Dawg jumped from my backpack at the first stop for <br/>
finding planet and fishes, as he so much wanted to get out!<br/>
<br/>
Hoping he finds a new traveling companion.....<br/>
