  Re: CT - ticks<br/><br/></div><tt>Megan Thompson writes ("RE: [LbNA] Re: 
  CT - ticks"):<br/>&gt;I had heard that the vaccine had been removed from the 
  market because there <br/>&gt;wasn't enough demand for it.  That was from 
  a friend who heard it on the <br/>&gt;news.  Can anybody verify 
  that?<br/><br/>It was pulled off the market in February, and "poor sales" was 
  indeed<br/>given as the reason.<br/><br/>However, there were also allegations of 
  Lymerix causing arthritis, and<br/>a rather large number of lawsuits, but the 
  FDA found no evidence<br/>supporting a link.  It probably contributed to 
  it being pulled from<br/>the market (because of litigation costs, if nothing 
  else).  Here's one<br/>article:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.sciam.com/explorations/2000/070500tick/">http://www.sciam.com/explorations/2000/070500tick/</a><br/><br/>Also, 
  sales were lagging since a lot of doctors were recommending<br/>against it, 
  either because of the above controversy, or because of a<br/>CDC 
  epidemiological study that said it wasn't economically effective<br/>unless it 
  was just given to very high risk individuals[1]<br/><br/><br/>[1] Of which I know 
  a few.  Field biologists who spend most of the<br/>year outside doing 
  fieldwork in areas with a Lyme risk have a<br/>substantial risk factor.  
  At least now they are getting better at<br/>recognizing the symptoms 
  early.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-- <br/>Richard W Kaszeta<br/>rich@kaszeta.org<br/><a href="http://www.kaszeta.org/rich">http://www.kaszeta.org/rich</a><br/></tt><br/><br/><tt>To
