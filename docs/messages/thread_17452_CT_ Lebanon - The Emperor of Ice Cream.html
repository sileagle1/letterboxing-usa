                    <div class="plaintext-content">The original planting of this box was on private land.  The land owner was upset and the box was moved to another location.  It is still being searched for in it's original location though.  If you have the original clues printed, please recylce/toss them.  <br/>
<br/>
Also regarding the second location.  It was planted under a bridge and is now missing.  It may have disappeared because of flooding.  If you have those clues you will want to recycle/toss them too.  The letterbox was in a large plastic bottle so if it did float away, there may be hope of finding it again someday.  It may have just started an interesting adventure.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone found it under the bridge since it's relocation, the owner (see letterboxing.org) would like to know.   I am not the owner, they are not a member of this listserv.  I'm just passing on the info.  <br/>
