down I carved a Mardi Gras stamp and made a little microbox. Clues <br/>
are on the main site, it was meant to be magnetic but I forgot glue <br/>
and had no way to attach the magnet.<br/>
<br/>
Mardi Gras, by the way, is great!!!It was so warm, I have a little <br/>
sunburn, and the kids had a blast dancing for beads. DH and I shared <br/>
some chairs with some locals, who gave us beads, cups, beer and just <br/>
that amazing southern hospitality. Go,go,go if you have the chance. <br/>
