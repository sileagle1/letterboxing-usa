"The African Queen" is a box planted in honor of the actress <br/>
Katharine Hepburn who costarred With Humphrey Bogart in the 1951 <br/>
movie "The African Queen." This box has been placed at the home of <br/>
fellow Thespian William Gillette. This is my first stamp and box, I <br/>
hope you enjoy it. - Pink Trotters.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the path along the stone wall from the parking lot towards the <br/>
Castle. Enter the trail under the stone archway, before you get to <br/>
the house or the depot. Go past the brick building and down the <br/>
trail. Follow the trail to the covered bridge. Walk through the <br/>
bridge and around a small bend. Observe the knee high stone ledge. <br/>
Walk up the embankment to the Oak tree. Where the dead stump is <br/>
sticking out of the ground at the base of the tree there is a pile of <br/>
rocks. The box lays beneath it. This is a VERY busy trail so please <br/>
be discrete. <br/>

the exact path you are talking about. Funny story... about a week ago I<br/>
tried setting up a family letter boxing day at Gillette, unfortunately my<br/>
sister couldn't make it and I couldn't get the clues from the website. I<br/>
guess it was lucky I didn't because now I get to hunt The African Queen too!<br/>
