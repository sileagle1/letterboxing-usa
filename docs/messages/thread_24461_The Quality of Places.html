I don't think every location has to be the most beautiful place.  While <br/>
I like a nice long hike, sometimes a clever clue or stamp in a little <br/>
local park is just the trick and can be just as enjoyable.  Further, <br/>
some people can't take that long hike to far off places, so those <br/>
"Little Boxes" are perfect for them as well.<br/>

I have to disagree. There are boxes out there that are fabulous, that have<br/>
absolutely nothing to do with where they are placed. Boxes have different<br/>
qualities, the location is only one of them.<br/>

I'm not really defining a quality place as one that has to end with a <br/>
long hike. I think that a nice park or a historical place that <br/>
happens to be right off the road are examples of a quality place. The <br/>
ones that I don't like are ones that are just hidden for the sake of <br/>
hiding a box. <br/>

Is this a tradition?  I tend not to think so.  There are many, many <br/>
older boxes out there that have nothing to do with their location at <br/>
all.  Nor do they need to.  A great box does not have to have any <br/>
connection at all to its location to be a great box.  Clever clues, a <br/>
great stamp, the company you keep when boxing can all attribute to a <br/>
great box.  I don't think it is totally dependent on one thing.<br/>

comes in, doesn't it?<br/>
<br/>
I think it's pretty much a temporary problem until new boxers figure out<br/>
what makes better spots.  Here a few months ago we had some new boxers in<br/>
our area who were very prolific and planted a lot of boxes, most of them<br/>
drive-bys and/or short-lived boxes.  I think those who have been boxing<br/>
awhile can compensate for the problem by upping the level of their own<br/>
boxes - that's what I did while these newbies were planting.  I planted a<br/>
couple of puzzle boxes, something new and challenging fo me, AND it provided<br/>
some new more difficult boxes to offset those easy ones that were cropping<br/>
up.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great points! I have really learned a lot this week from this <br/>
discussion and from finding some really great places. I really have <br/>
thought about my places and how they have changed over the past two <br/>
years and they have gotten better. You are right there is a learning <br/>
curve, and some people like myself will read and think about things <br/>
sometimes so long that I never get out and do them. Others are more <br/>
spontanious and go out and do and learn from what they do and improve <br/>
themselves. <br/>
<br/>
What I like is finding a box that was place by a newbie say a year <br/>
ago and then finding one that they placed recently to see the <br/>
changes. In fact, I learned somethings from their placement. <br/>
<br/>
I think that I jumped the gun a little about micro's I am a <br/>
traditionalist, but not everybody is and that is they way things <br/>
should be.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all for putting up with me during this discussion.<br/>

It's amazing how much better we've gotten at the hunt and spotting errors others have made in placement (resulting in ransacked and missing boxes) and construction/weatherproofing (sometimes so 'well' that they are soaked from holding the moisture from a terrible placement).  <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully I will not eat these words in the next year or so!  We will be placing our first toward the end of October to commemorate the 25th anniversary of our friendship near the place where we met while working together. There are several others planned but (for you Baker) with thought as to place/stamp tie-in. :)<br/>

Happy boxing - I'm lovin' it!<br/>

If I can get ses to concentrate on the placing rather than the finding. She's pretty much into the hunt.  Hopefully once we plant the first one in October, I will convince her that we should make plans to do a bit of carving over the winter!  We shall see come next spring.  <br/>
<br/>
If she doesn't, I will for sure. I've got a bunch of ideas swirling around in the grey matter. It's not like we're joined at the hip!  <br/>
