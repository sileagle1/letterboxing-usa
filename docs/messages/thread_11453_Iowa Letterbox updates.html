I am glad to hear that Black Angel is still alive too, as I was the one who pressured Amanda into planting it, even though she didn't have her tools on her.  I think the angel is kind of cool, and actually looks like something one of us would have carved.  I actually did not even want to go near the statue myself in broad daylight as it had a decidedly sinister cast about it - I could feel it from 200 yards away!  And I guess it just goes to show that they never clean up around those cemeteries<br/>

I created a stamp last year to replace the missing one in <br/>
Riverside.  I just think the future birthplace of Captain Kirk <br/>
really needs a stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad I didn't have it out there for you to stamp.<br/>
Here's a picture of the image.  Maybe you can print it off and tape <br/>
it in your book.<br/>
