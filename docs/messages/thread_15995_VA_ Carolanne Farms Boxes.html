devastation from Isabelle has been cleaned.<br/>
<br/>
ARA Cowboys: Great shape though we had to pull a tree off it to get to it.<br/>
All the clues still relevant.<br/>
<br/>
The YIN and The YANG boxes: Still there and in breat shape. Your can no<br/>
longer count the paths though, as the hurricane flattened most of the<br/>
defining landmarks. Take the path after the "6" marker to find them now.<br/>
<br/>
The Jolly Rodger: Still there and in good shape, but the rating for the box<br/>
has changed! Three big trees are fallen across the path. One you can duck<br/>
under, two you have to climb over, one of those is all wrapped in a thorn<br/>
bush, so beware!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to check our Redwing boxes tomorrow,<br/>
Lone Pony<br/>
