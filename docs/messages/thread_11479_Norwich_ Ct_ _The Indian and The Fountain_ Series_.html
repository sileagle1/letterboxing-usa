(At long last the first box has been replaced and moved to a slightly <br/>
more hidden spot.  Unfortunally, none of these boxes are really in <br/>
private areas so please use the utmost caution when hunting for the <br/>
series. Patrick and Amy)<br/>
<br/>
  Place: Mohegan Park, Norwich, Ct.<br/>
  Rated: Easy 1 mile loop.  Trail is handicap/wheelchair accessable, <br/>
unfortunally the boxes are not.  All the boxes are slightly off <br/>
trail.  The park has a playground and swimming area for the kids, so <br/>
if you bring little ones, plan on spending some time.<br/>

  From Hartford, take Route 2 East to the end of the expressway in <br/>
Norwich.  At the intersection go straight to Route 169.  At the light <br/>
take a right on to Ox Hill Road.  Round the rotary to Wilderness <br/>
Road, then right onto Mohegan Park Road.  Go through the stop sign at <br/>
the swimming area and continue to the parking area on the right <br/>
marked by a sign that says "to Picnic Pavilion." As you enter the <br/>
parking lot take notice of a path on your right that will be your <br/>
start point.  Park at the first place you find on the right.<br/>
  Walk back towards the road and take the first paved path on your <br/>
left, (this is the path you passed as you entered the parkinglot).  <br/>
Follow the path to a small bridge (just a very short way).  On the <br/>
left side of the bridge AFTER YOU CROSS IT, under a large flat rock <br/>
that sits half under the bridge and behind two small rocks, you will <br/>
find the first of your four rewards.  Stamp in as descreatly as <br/>
possible this is a very busy part of the park.<br/>
  Continue on the path at the "Y" intersection go left and follow the <br/>
path along the brook and the backside of the parking lot.  At the <br/>
Next "Y" intersection go right, keeping the parkinglot on your left.  <br/>
At the next "Y" intersection go right and then a very quick left. <br/>
Strait through the next intersection, and follow the path around the <br/>
pond.  (For a very nice view, take a quick strool down the bridge but <br/>
that's not part of the quest.) Keeping the water to your left, you <br/>
will come to a chainlink fence follow the fence along the water and <br/>
road.  After the fence ends go left closer to the water.  Continue on <br/>
the paved path past the bouys (swimming season) or bouy anchor (non-<br/>
swimming season) until you come to a bench on your right.  Rest here, <br/>
and enjoy the ducks.  (They were very hungry when this was planted.)  <br/>
