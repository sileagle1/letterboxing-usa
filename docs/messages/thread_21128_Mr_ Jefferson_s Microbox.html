I got this from the Wayback Machine.  The Forest Frogs have probably <br/>
moved on from the hobby.  I couldn't tell you whether it is still <br/>
there or not.  Scarab<br/>

Difficulty     Half hour easy flat hike, mostly on paved walkway, <br/>
with some walking through grass. There are many places to stop and <br/>
rest along the way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions     Park in the lot behind the Jefferson Memorial at the <br/>
south end of the Tidal Basin. This is a microbox, so please either <br/>
bring a small stamp or use only the most significant part of your <br/>
stamp. While there is more than one path from the start to the box, <br/>
we have chosen what we believe to be the most scenic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues     Start your journey at the feet of the third U.S. <br/>
President. All around you are some of his famous words. You will <br/>
need to note which wall (NE, NW, SE, or SW) contains the following <br/>
words: "As new discoveries are made ... institutions must advance <br/>
also to keep pace with the times." You will need this information <br/>
later in your journey.<br/>
<br/>
With this information in hand, proceed to the north side of the <br/>
memorial. Take a walk along the Tidal Basin in a clockwise <br/>
direction. Cross the inlet bridge and stay by the water's edge past <br/>
the Japanese Pagoda and the FDR Memorial. Continue on the same path <br/>
past the Japanese Lantern and over a second, longer bridge.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately as you leave the bridge, you will come to a fork in the <br/>
sidewalk. Continue straight, no longer following the water's edge. <br/>
Just past the stoplight, notice the Library before you. Between the <br/>
sidewalk and the large tree is the main path (the widest one) <br/>
through the Library. From the start of this path, walk 45 paces (1 <br/>
pace = 2 steps) to the exit on the opposite side. Next, walk 55 <br/>
paces at 160 degrees to a large tree; be sure to wave "hi" to Mr. <br/>
Jefferson along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Do you remember which wall the quote was on? Head that direction for <br/>
32 paces to another large tree, and 30 additional paces in the same <br/>
direction to a third and final large tree. Forage ahead into the <br/>
shelter of two large pines. From the base of the second pine, walk <br/>
three paces due south, where you will see a gathering of sticks and <br/>
bark in the ivy at the base of a small tree. Beneath this cover is <br/>
the (very small) object of your desire.<br/>
<br/>
To return, head to the water's edge and continue in a clockwise <br/>
direction back to the memorial.<br/>

It was still there in Feb 04--although the logbook was sopping wet--<br/>
we were still able to carefully sign in.  We added a plastic bag to <br/>
it and improved the camouflage a bit.  Hopefully, it's still there.  <br/>
It has a neat stamp with excellent clues!<br/>
