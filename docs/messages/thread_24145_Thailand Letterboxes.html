daelphinus (last but not least) ..... we are going to Thailand in a less<br/>
than a couple of months and wanted to check with you all to  gather any<br/>
info that my be of help. Good possibility that we can check on the status<br/>
of those lb's  while we are being dazzled by all the new sights. Been<br/>
cold for too long and looking for some HOT weather, Ha! ...i guess we<br/>
will be going to the right place for sure. Very curious about whether you<br/>
rode the SKY TRAIN or tried tje subay system in Bangkok.   Do that have<br/>
and did you try buying things from a grocery store (floating market)? <br/>
One of my other enjoyments is to try the TEA and local  HONEY (i wonder<br/>
if honey is a common product, they must have bees there) for whereever we<br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any information .........<br/>
<br/>
 Peace &amp; Love ... budster of the Catskills ......<br/>
