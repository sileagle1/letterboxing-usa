Boxes they put out freely for the unwashed common folks like me.<br/>

Sure, it hurts to think my really spiffy A Major Award hitchhiker got trashed right after I put it out, and no one even got a chance to see it!  Heck, I thought it was my best effort so far.<br/>

Life's like that.  As long as I'm not deployed to Iraq, I can take anything else in stride.  Have some sense of proportion.  My parents sent nine children out into the world - we can show some fortitude putting out boxes of stamps.<br/>

I've been reading all these angry posts bashing newbies and I'm wondering what's the big deal? Yes, "newbies" tend to ask annoying questions, but get over it. It's life, it happens all the time, or do you live in a plastic bubble people? Everybody asks stupid questions, and a lot of people probably perfer a "one-on-one" teaching of sorts than reading it on the FAQ's. It gives it a better sense of connection, which isn't that what this list is about? <br/>

first joined this list (won't say I STUDIED them,<br/>
because I didn't, but I did look and read), and I<br/>
listened for a bit before I posted, but I was excited<br/>
about getting started and I still had questions.  I<br/>
had no frame of reference to understand some of what I<br/>
read in the archives.  The FAQ was great, but it was<br/>
still sometimes difficult to get a dynamic picture of<br/>
what letterboxing is about.  Think of it kind of like<br/>
a textbook - you can hand a student an algebra book,<br/>
and they can maybe figure out how to do algebra, but<br/>
if you hand them the book AND you have a dialog with<br/>
them about algebra, they will truly learn to<br/>
UNDERSTAND algebra.<br/>
<br/>
As it happens, I joined the list in the middle of a<br/>
huge heated debate that disintegrated before my eyes<br/>
into a flame war.  It was not conducive to a newbie<br/>
who wanted to learn about letterboxing, so I kept my<br/>
questions to myself.  I also didn't advertise myself<br/>
as a newbie for fear of being squashed like a bug!<br/>
<br/>
Shouldn't there be some tolerance here?  I mean, this<br/>
is a community of sorts, and a good old adage is "you<br/>
are only as strong as your weakest link".  A newbie<br/>
asking a "dumb" question today maybe a seasoned pro<br/>
placing great boxes in a sparsely populated area next<br/>
year.  If we are patient and tolerant of the new ones,<br/>
we become a larger stronger community.  <br/>
<br/>
For those of you who consider yourselves to be the<br/>
elite, I applaud you.  You are striving to be the best<br/>
of the best in letterboxing.  You are giving me<br/>
something to look up to and strive for myself.  Thank<br/>
you for that.  But consider this:  you can get to the<br/>
top of the heap in two ways:  you can chop away at it<br/>
and run people off so they don't want to be a part of<br/>
the heap and then what are you the elite of?  Or you<br/>
can build the heap up by helping to raise the lesser<br/>
ones like me to a higher level and then, instead of<br/>
being the top of the heap, you can be kings of the<br/>
mountain.<br/>

IMHO the best possible way to learn about the ways of boxing is just by going out <br/>
there and seeing what others have done...the good, the bad, the ugly, the amazing <br/>
- it is all out there for you to enjoy. That is one of the best qualities about this <br/>
hobby - that it gives everyone a chance to participate in some way whether they are <br/>
an expert bookbinder and restore antique books - and make the most incredible <br/>
hand-crafted logbooks that I've ever seen, or maybe they are an incredible clue-<br/>
crafter....or an amazing carver...or perhaps they are just good at sharing special <br/>
places with others.<br/>
<br/>
I think that despite all the quote: "perfectionsim and elitism" that I really enjoy each <br/>
and every single box I've found for one reason or another. Besides, if there weren't <br/>
differences then there would be no gossip at the gatherings, and everyone knows <br/>
that I'm just there for the gossip ;-) right mark?! <br/>
<br/>
I hardly consider myself a "seasoned" letterboxer. Others might disagree or agree, I <br/>
don't really care. All I know is that when I started there were NO boxes in Portland <br/>
(Maine that is) and now there are new boxers, and amazing fun new boxes and I'm <br/>
having a blast. Thank you to all the cool letterboxers in Maine. Rock on!!<br/>

I think that's an element of one of the points I<br/>
didn't make very well.  How do you know how to go out<br/>
there and do it if you don't get a little education<br/>
about it first?  I'm the sort of person that will<br/>
read, read, read, then do.  I had a stack of books<br/>
about childbirth that I read before I gave birth.  I<br/>
learned a lot by reading, but there was no way those<br/>
books could have prepared me for the real thing!  Lots<br/>
of people aren't like that - they don't want to read,<br/>
can't read, aren't comfortable with the internet<br/>
maybe?  But they might be artists and naturalists who<br/>
will make excellent letterboxers, if allowed to get<br/>
familiar with it in their own way.<br/>
<br/>
Newbies have heard about letterboxing somehow. <br/>
They've found our list and see there are lots of other<br/>
letterboxers out there and some of them are obviously<br/>
really, really into it and have lots of experience - a<br/>
wealth of resource to tap into!  They are excited to<br/>
get out and go - they just want to do it - but they<br/>
don't quite know how.  They just want to ask a few<br/>
questions and hit the trail.  So they post a question<br/>
and get blasted for not reading the archives and FAQ. <br/>
Maybe they decide this big intimidating list isn't for<br/>
them, but they are still intrigued by letterboxing, so<br/>
they find some clues and they just get out there and<br/>
go.  But they haven't read or heard about etiquette<br/>
issues like rehiding or contacting placers or<br/>
whatever.  They are letterboxing, but they aren't<br/>
letterboxing well.  And then other letterboxers get<br/>
upset with them.  And there goes that vicious circle<br/>
again!<br/>
