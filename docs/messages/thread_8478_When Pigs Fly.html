                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last August when Tom Noone (many thanks, you and I know who you are!) posted the cryptic clue for The <br/>
Mystery Gathering, my curiosity was piqued. Inquiring minds want to know and all that... So, I proceeded <br/>
to figure out date, time and place just for fun, as funhogs are wont to do. When I was asked to make an <br/>
appearance for business in the Boston area on October 16, I looked at my calendar and figured it was a <br/>
synchronicity made in heaven: go to the Gathering, make money AND unfold the next phase of the <br/>
KMartha/faux Martha prank (sorry, Wanda, you weren't expected to be the finder of the April Fool's <br/>
opus. Denial changes nothing.)  What more could a pig ask for?<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely loved meeting the gang that showed. I got to add a number of wonderful hand carved stamps <br/>
to my logbook/gallery. I consider this hobby a form of folk art and love it all, from primitive to Picasso. <br/>
Mad Mary's signature stamp is a masterpiece but then I adore Alicia's Boo stamp as well. Store bought or <br/>
hand made, it was great fun exchanging stamps with everyone there, getting faces to match names and <br/>
making the acquaintance of the Eastern Clan. Commodore Drew and Ms. Alafair made my day with their <br/>
warm welcome and willingness to collaborate. <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, we will meet again. Perhaps it will be on the trails of the Pacific Northwest. Funhog<br/>

Uh-oh! Looks like an actual admission that the K-Martha hitcher we <br/>
came across in Oregon late last May was not intended to be found by <br/>
US!!! We were also told that we were not even supposed to have the <br/>
clues to the particular box where we found it, but somehow we did! <br/>
Oh,well, we certainly did not intend to foil anyone's special plan, <br/>
but the fact remains - due to false assumptions or whatever (and <br/>
denying it definitely does not change anything!) - there are now 2 <br/>
nearly identical K-Martha stamps! Actually, we think it's kind of <br/>
funny! Just like we're now going to count 10 ants instead of just 1, <br/>
we now get to count 2 K-Marthas, as does anyone else lucky enough to <br/>
find both the original hitcher and the event stamp, as we did! So, <br/>
best of luck to all of you in your various searches, and don't forget <br/>
that there are still a whole lot of really neat letterboxes out <br/>
there, as well as hitchers, that sometimes have to wait even longer <br/>
than 4 months before they are found!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
