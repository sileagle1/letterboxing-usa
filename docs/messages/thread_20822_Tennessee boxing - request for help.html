BigGuy - thanks for the report on my Gatlinburg box and for the <br/>
lovely compliment!  <br/>
<br/>
I understand that the first logbook is full and that someone was <br/>
kind enough to put a second one in which now is also nearly full.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone nearby who might retrieve the full logs and mail <br/>
them to me?  I'll glady reimburse for postage and send a new HH as a <br/>
bonus.<br/>
<br/>
Please email me offlist if you can help.  If I don't hear from <br/>
anyone soon, I'll update the clues with the same request so new <br/>
finders will be ready.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and happy hunting,<br/>
Zed<br/>
<br/>

&gt; The family and I enjoyed a too quick weekend trip down to eastern<br/>
&gt; Tennessee this weekend.  We viewed the magnificent foliage and <br/>
found<br/>
&gt; the Gatlinburg letterbox as a bonus.  It was great to get to view <br/>
so<br/>
&gt; many signature stamps from folks around the country that we usually<br/>
&gt; don't cross paths with.  Very nice box - dry and in good <br/>
condition -<br/>
&gt; and a very nice stamp.<br/>
