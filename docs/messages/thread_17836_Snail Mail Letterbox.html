on our way out of town for what should have been a romantic B&amp;B getaway to <br/>
the gold country. We had 2 boxes ready to plant and everything. Poor Old Blue <br/>
had the sniffles and a cough and we'd thought about canceling the trip but <br/>
forged on. After one night of coughing enough to worry about waking our neighboring <br/>
B&amp;B'ers, and what is surely a sinus infection coming on, we had to curtail <br/>
our trip and come home. Didn't get to plant or find! SOOOOO glad we have the <br/>
postal box to feed our habit!<br/>
<br/>
Actually, after getting home and tucking the sickie into bed for a nap, I <br/>
snuck out and placed "Cupid's Arrow" in our own home town. <br/>
<br/>
Will get the box off to the next lucky recipient on Monday! Thanks for the <br/>
great stamp and for including us in the fun!<br/>

Letterboxers take nothing and leave nothing<br/>
but good impressions. Sir B<br/>
