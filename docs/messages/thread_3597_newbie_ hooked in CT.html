<br/>
We first heard of letterboxing over a year ago, did a couple of boxes<br/>
this spring, and have worked ourselves into a definite love of<br/>
letterboxing by now.  In October alone, we've done the Rev. War box on<br/>
Lebanon green, Curious George in Haddam, Gnomelet series in Lyme, Ashford<br/>
Oak, Merrow Park, Stars and Stripes at Nathan Hale Homestead, BenE at<br/>
Creaser Park, and today the Bird Walk in Storrs.  I can't tell you how<br/>
many people I've told about letterboxing and what a great response I've<br/>
had from them -- some of whom are browsing clues and searching lately<br/>
too.  My kids (6 and 3 y.o.) call it treasure hunting, not letterboxing,<br/>
and I tend to agree with them that it does feel like finding a treasure<br/>
each time we nab one.  We homeschool and are thrilled with the way the<br/>
clue styles and/or locations tie in with all sorts of history and events<br/>
and notable people, places, and things, not to mention learning to<br/>
identify trees along the way, use a compass, and generally having a great<br/>
time in the sunshine together.  Ah, but you folks already know how great<br/>
it all is....    <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just wanted to pop in and say hi and thanks to all of you for<br/>
providing such a challenging and fun letterboxing environment for newbies<br/>
in the CT area!  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, we'll be visiting Portugal this xmas and were thinking that might be<br/>
a good place to plant our first box.  I wanted to see if there are any<br/>
boxes already there to find as well, but have been unable to get<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.com to load for the past week (I get a timed out<br/>
error each time).  Anybody know what's up with that, or is it just me?<br/>

something.  ;-)<br/>

and we started in April. From the letterboxes that you've done, it sounds<br/>
like you're in eastern Ct. like us.  What I love is that although I've lived<br/>
here all  my life, I've learned so m uch about places and their history and<br/>
stories right here that I never knew.  And the kids learn alot along the<br/>
way, (mine are 10 and 7 by the way.)  Anyways, try www.letterboxing.org,<br/>
instead of com.  Another good thing about letterboxing, it hasn't gone<br/>
commercial yet!  Good luck planting your first.  That's a bunch of fun too!<br/>
