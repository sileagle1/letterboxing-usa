adventure in Damascus, Virginia.  If you like to hike, bike, <br/>
horseback ride, camp, swim, and fishthis is the town for you!  While <br/>
I was there I hid three boxes.  My family had fun hunting them  I <br/>
hope you do, too!<br/>

This one is so different from the others on the trail<br/>
Had to be rebuilt because of an awful morning gale<br/>
Between 17 and 18, age I not discuss<br/>
You will find the Finest Family in Virginia, <br/>
lead by a man named Gus.<br/>

Over the river and through the woods<br/>
to the Creeper Trail Cottages we go.<br/>
The bike knows the way <br/>
to the best place to stay in Trailtown USA.<br/>
<br/>
Look for the tan, brick duplex closest to the trail<br/>
watch your step!<br/>

At the end of the train, as opposed to the end of the trail, <br/>
you'll find you have miles to go regardless of which way you hail.<br/>
You'll find Whoa Nellie tucked in a box; <br/>
underneath you'll have to look as smart as a fox.<br/>
