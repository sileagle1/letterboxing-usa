that Ryan will be in Monson ME on September 16th, hanging out near Shaw's Boarding <br/>
House.  His pocketmail gadget is still busted so he can't communicate with the <br/>
letterboxers who had planned to meet him - if you were one of them, please just <br/>
show up there tomorrow!<br/>

Thanks So Much to Princess Lea for posting that previous message for <br/>
me! Ryan is out of touch. He is currently in the 100-Mile Wilderness <br/>
and Hopefully I will meet with him at Baxter State Park on September <br/>
22nd. He plans to summit Katahdin on the 23rd. If any Maine <br/>
letterboxers still want to meet. Perhaps we can get together on the <br/>
24th. I will not be able to answer emails after Sept. 19th. So if you <br/>
want to make plans, we need to do it now. <br/>
<br/>

PS: from Maine, Ryan will be flying to Boston and staying with his <br/>
cousin there for several days. So if Boston is more convenient for <br/>
you, then he will be there from Sept 25th-Oct...<br/>
