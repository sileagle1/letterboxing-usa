Rumor has it that a particular clique has chosen to control<br/>
circulation of these boxes that I created.  I am not associated<br/>
with, nor do I approve of this decision, but my philosophy is<br/>
that once I create a box, it is at the mercy of the elements<br/>
(whatever they are), which, over time, add to the challenge<br/>
of solving any box created.<br/>
<br/>
As a separate aside, cliques ruin letterboxing, tho they are<br/>
part of the art for some (JMHO ...)<br/>

I'm not sure if anyone has said anything about this yet, but I did have that box about 8 months ago I think.  I don't know if that helps anyone but I did pass it along.<br/>

Never knew you to deal in rumors, Randy! :o) <br/>
<br/>
Many things can happen over years, I wouldn't be quick to listen to <br/>
listen to rumors as they are often just the petty murmurs of those <br/>
who have bones to pick with others.  Believe half of what you read <br/>
and nothing of what you hear I think the adage goes.<br/>
<br/>
As far as letterboxing- lots of things ruin it.  No respect for the <br/>
secrecy of the game, competition, numbers above the experience, <br/>
miscreants who target individual's boxes, blabbermouths announcing <br/>
whereabouts of mystery boxes, ...could go on, but you know as well as <br/>
I know what takes the fun out of things- overall disrespect for other <br/>
boxers.<br/>
<br/>
I hope the boxes are found, perhaps someone has them in a backpack <br/>
having meant to send them on ages ago and is too embarassed to do so <br/>
now?  Either way, perhaps this will jog them loose from wherever they <br/>
may be so those who are interested can log in.<br/>
<br/>
~A<br/>
who has no clue what the count is in my book, but knows what <br/>
letterboxing used to be and laments the loss.<br/>
