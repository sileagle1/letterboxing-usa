                    <div class="plaintext-content">   Yesterday, Christine and I went to do a few letterboxes.  First <br/>
was Queen of a River.  On the drive in to the parking area, we saw a <br/>
large wasp nest!  Right above a mailbox.  As we were in the car, not <br/>
a big deal.  <br/>
   Then proceeded to attempt Pow-Wow at the Caves.  On the trail in <br/>
(180 holds the better tally) we saw an even bigger nest ahead of us, <br/>
situated on a branch, right next to the trail!  We decided to turn <br/>
around and try the other trail.  As that trail looked to include <br/>
some tricky footwork and our minds being on wasps nests at head <br/>
level, we gave it a pass. <br/>
    Just a heads up to anyone coming after us.  I just keep thinking <br/>
of walking head first into a nest!  Is there a "wasp season"?  <br/>
Hiking for years and have never seen such nests.  2 in one day even!<br/>
    Went on to find Giants of Crandall Field.  There was a craft <br/>
fair at the field which was an unexpected surprise.  <br/>
<br/>
Watch Out For Wasps!!<br/>

Usually after the first killing frost, the wasps are gone...except the queen <br/>
and a few workers who will overwinter....unlike the bumble bees that I stirred <br/>
up yesterday in my yard! Yowch!<br/>
<br/>
Wasps/hornets die off in winter.<br/>
Honey Bees and bumble bees remain inside their hive. (there are also <br/>
carpenter bees and miner bees but I'm not sure where they go in winter)<br/>
<br/>
Bees= fuzzy<br/>
Wasps/hornets = smooth bodies /often dangling legs<br/>
<br/>
So probably by the end of October/start of November the wasps should have <br/>
been frozen out by frost.<br/>
