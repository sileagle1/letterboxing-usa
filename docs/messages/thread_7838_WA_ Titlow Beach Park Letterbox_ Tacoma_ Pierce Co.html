Titlow Beach Letterbox, University Place area of Tacoma, WA, Pierce County<br/>
<br/>
Access: Moderate to easy. Short walk along paved trail.  To access the box a<br/>
little negotiating of rocks is necessary.<br/>
Clues:  Very easy.<br/>
<br/>
Placed 9/21/02 by the Nail Family<br/>
Commemorates Robert Nail, deceased patriarch of the Nail Family and avid scuba<br/>
diver whose cremated ashes were scattered in the waters of Puget Sound near the<br/>
Narrows Bridge on this day.  Robert had logged in over 1000 dives in Puget Sound<br/>
and the Narrows was by far his most frequent dive location.  His is missed by<br/>
many.<br/>
<br/>
Titlow Beach is located along Puget Sound just south of the Narrows Bridge. <br/>
Titlow Beach is well known locally as a great place for scuba divers to take a<br/>
'shore dive'. In fact, many area scuba schools utilize this beach as a teaching<br/>
area because of its close proximity to urban Tacoma as well as the abundant<br/>
underwater wildlife.  This was the location of Robert's first dive.  He also<br/>
brought many of his dive buddies here to test their skills before taking them<br/>
out to the waters under the bridge.<br/>
<br/>
To get to Titlow Beach from I-5:<br/>
Northbound or Southbound--take Exit #125 to Bridgeport Way.  Go West onto<br/>
Bridgeport Way and follow several miles thru Lakewood and into the town of<br/>
University Place.  Turn left onto 19th St and follow down the hill to near the<br/>
waterfront.  Just before the railroad tracks, turn right onto Shorefront Drive. <br/>
Shorefront Drive will bring you to a stop sign at 6th Ave.  There will be a<br/>
parking lot to the left.  Turn onto 6th and cirle around into the parking lot on<br/>
the left.  Titlow Beach Park is directly accross the railroad tracks along the<br/>
waterfront.<br/>
<br/>
Titlow Beach is a small urban waterfront park with a short paved walkway between<br/>
Burlington Northern Railway and the waterfront.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Start at the railroad crossing on 6th Ave and head down the paved<br/>
walkway between the railroad tracks and the beach.  Keep watch for a madrona<br/>
tree on the left.  From madrona take 10 paces Northward.  The box lies under a<br/>
square concrete slab that overhangs the breakwater rocks above the beach. <br/>
Please be careful replacing the box to insure that it cannot be seen by beach<br/>
walkers.  We have initially placed a small rock in front of it to hide it. The<br/>
box is wooden and may wash out with the first storm this winter.  If so, I will<br/>
replace with another more durable and less boyant box if needed.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the park and thank you for helping to remember our patriarch, Robert Nail.<br/>
