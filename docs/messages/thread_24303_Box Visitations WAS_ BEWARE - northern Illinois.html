I also don't think that it's totally inconceivable that we could find this<br/>
type of stuff happening here and there, altho in probably very very rare<br/>
situations, as the media brings the idea of letterboxing to more and more<br/>
people. I don't about your neck of the woods, but no boxes around here have<br/>
to go for "days and weeks, even months or years" before having finders. Not<br/>
if they're posted on LbNA or atlasquest. Around here, it's a matter of<br/>
hours, sometimes minutes, of when the box is posted on LbNA or atlasquest<br/>
that boxers start working the clues. :-) Boxes planted in 40 below zero<br/>
weather with 3 feet of snow on the ground, yeah, those might sit a bit<br/>
waiting for nicer weather to come along.<br/>

Boxes like mine, which are only on my own website (and there's a link on<br/>
Silent Doug's site) can go without even a first finder for ages -- there's<br/>
one I placed last summer that hasn't had a first finder yet, tho I haven't<br/>
gotten around to doing Spring Cleaning on it yet, so I may be surprised when<br/>
I get there.  First Finder Certificate and gift just might be gone.  :-)<br/>
But a lot of my boxes, while not necessarily total mystery boxes, do have<br/>
some figuring out to do ahead of time, especially to find the starting<br/>
locations.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes around here that are on LbNA and atlasquest and that are<br/>
straightforward in their clues seem to get plenty of visitors tho, often a<br/>
large flurry at the beginning, then it seems to slow down.  By the time I<br/>
get around to finding any of 'em a couple of months down the road, there are<br/>
usually a lot of stamps in the logbook already.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are a lot more newbie letterboxers around this area than<br/>
veteran boxers, and the more straightforward clues seem to be preferred, by<br/>
what I see in the logbooks.  I think possibly we have more boxers in this<br/>
area who box with young children so they don't want to take the time to<br/>
navigate difficult clues.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the box that the lady whose car was broken into was looking<br/>
for -- those clues wouldn't be bad for me at all.  Yes, it appears there may<br/>
be various ways to read the clues.  I see those clues, not as vague, but as<br/>
ambiguous.  I'll just try every combination I can think of until I find the<br/>
right one.  :-)  Someone with young children might not figure they have that<br/>
option since children will have neither the attention span nor the patience<br/>
for that.  Elmer, my big ol' boy hounddawg, on the other hand, has endless<br/>
patience when we're boxing.  Altho his patience is even more endless if I<br/>
remember the baggie of cut-up fried chicken.<br/>
<br/>
But I think that's one reason why people in this area might stamp into<br/>
logbooks with straightforward clues a lot more -- because there might be<br/>
more people boxing with children.  Not to say that there aren't plenty of<br/>
adults who seem to prefer totally straightforward clues too tho.<br/>
