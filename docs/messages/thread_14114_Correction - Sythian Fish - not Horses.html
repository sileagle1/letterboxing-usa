that I had listed our Sythian Fish as Sythian Horses which surely <br/>
would have confused folks who found the box.  The corrected listing <br/>
is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Sythian Fish<br/>
Difficulty: easy<br/>
Terrain: moderate (not too bad)<br/>

This letterbox is located in the Scioto Trails State Park South of <br/>
Chillicothe, OH.  Enter the park from U.S. Route #23 (south of <br/>
Chillicothe  north of Waverly) and drive past the fire tower to Park <br/>
Road #1.  After a short distance on Park Road #1, turn right on Park <br/>
Road #4.  Follow Park Road #4 about 1 tenth of a mile to a parking <br/>
area on the right.  Park your vehicle and admire the fabulous view of <br/>
the southern Ohio hills then make your way to the most northerly end <br/>
of the bench that is placed at the front of the parking area by the <br/>
large rocks.  Standing behind this bench, take a bearing of 308 and <br/>
go about 17 paces (1 pace = 2 steps).  You should find yourself at <br/>
the edge of the woods where a small trail leads into the woods.  <br/>
Follow this trail about 16 paces to a blackened stump right beside <br/>
the trail.  From this stump, take a bearing of 240 and go about 4 <br/>
paces to a small pile of sticks and leaves that conceals our Sythian <br/>
fish.  Have fun and if you find it email us at bigguy9210@yahoo.com <br/>
and let us know how it's doing.<br/>
