                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK....  I seriously didn't think that this mystery was too hard, considering <br/>
the resources of the internet.  However, when I checked on the box this past <br/>
weekend, no one had stamped in since March.  :-(<br/>
<br/>
I have already narrowed the search down to SE CT, however, I'm wondering if I <br/>
need to narrow it down to a town.  For those of you who have already found <br/>
it.... any ideas????   I'm starting to feel bad for the business that the box is <br/>
in, since its my favorite place in CT (besides Campbell Falls) and I was <br/>
hoping to enjoy it with the rest of you!  (I'm hoping to get True Soccer Fan there <br/>
within the next couple of weeks....  We went right by the place this past <br/>
weekend, but he REALLY wanted to go to the beach....  sigh....)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, those of you who have located the box... any ideas????<br/>
