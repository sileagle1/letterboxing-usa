                    <div class="plaintext-content">This letterbox adventure, 4 boxes in all, is especially suited to children ages 4-12.  It has been made with the purpose of sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ in mind.  Adults may enjoy it as well. <br/>
<br/>
(Note, these clues originally were printed and given to children in my church.  Each clues sheet had a cover sheet printed with a box formed of various shapes that fit the different stamps inside the letterboxes.  The shapes gave the children the idea of where to stamp the images on the paper and when all stamps were found, a completed picture was made.  I do not have the means to scan the image of the stamp boxes for use on this clues list.  However, the first stamp is in the shape of a isocolese triangle  and should be in the center of the paper with the equal sides angling up to the center (like the peak of a roof).  The 2nd stamp is polygon with an angled side that aligns with the left side of the triangle.  The 3rd stamp aligns with the right side of the triangle.  The 4th and last stamp is a rectangle and should be stamped under the triangle. The stamps were originally all one large stamp and then cut to form the various shapes to allow the formation of the final picture. Due to the overall size, a small notepad will not be sufficient for these stamps unless the images are squeezed together. Further note, the stamps were made from a hard plastic cutting board material and do not stamp well.  It is best to place the paper over the stamp rather than stamping the paper.  I may remake the stamp images with a more traditional stamp making material at a later date.) <br/>

Location:  Wonderwood Park, Lacey, Washington.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From I-5 north or southbound, take Exit #108 to Martin Way in Lacey.  Head West on Martin Way to the next intersection, College Street.  Turn left onto College St.  Go thru several lights and turn left onto Lacey Blvd.  Turn right at the next light, Ruddell Rd.  Follow Ruddell for appx 2 miles and Brentwood Drive will be on the right.  There will be a church on the left and a small brown sign on the right directing to Wonderwood Park.  Turn right onto Brentwood and follow up the slight hill and around the curve to the right.  Please drive slow as there are many children living in this residential area.  The park is to the left about 1/10 of a mile up Brentwood.  Park in the main parking lot in front of the baseball fields.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added to you. Matthew 6:33<br/>
Start at the  cedar tree next to the main parking lot in front of the baseball fields.  Follow the paved path between the fields.<br/>
<br/>
Pass by the dugout at 1st base and visit the dugout at 3rd at the other field too.  <br/>
While at home plate get yourself a drink of water at the fountain.  This water will fill you once but there is water that you can drink and never be thirsty again.  Jesus promises springs of living water gushing from our inmost being when we believe and follow Him.<br/>
<br/>
While you are at the fountain use your compass and take the path that leads to the west thru the forest.  (Your compass needle will always point to the North, West is to the left of North)<br/>
<br/>
When you see the bench on the left, have a seat.  You havent found the treasure yet, you have fallen short of your quest.  That goes to show that the Bible is right when it says that All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.,  Romans 3:23. That means that everyone has done something bad or wrong in their life.  There is no one who has not lied, cheated, stolen, disobeyed or just plain had a bad attitude.  Everyone has done it. The Bible also says that The wages of sin is death...  Romans 6:23a.  That means that since we have done bad things we deserve to die.  But dont despair because the Bible says in the same verse that  ...the gift of God is eternal life thru Christ Jesus our Lord., Romans 6:23b.   The treasure can still be found!  Here is a another clue:<br/>

neat forum to introduce letterboxing ... to your congregations youth group.  <br/>
I noticed it is very kid friendly.  I like your note to the new letterboxer:<br/>
<br/>
"The trick is to remember that the inked part of the stamp faces the paper. "<br/>
<br/>
If we are ever in that area ... we'll be sure to visit.  what state is it <br/>
