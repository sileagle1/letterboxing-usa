I'd do what you want and not worry about it. Who is going to know or <br/>
be harmed? I don't think stamping 2 cards is "transmitting" anyway.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Warrior Woman, you have my permission to send images from <br/>
any of my letterboxes to Pandora.  I think it's a nice gesture.  I'm <br/>
sure she's not going to publish them anywhere.  I sent her a tiny <br/>
HH I found recently (it fit in a film canister!) as well as a <br/>
brand-new microbox I made that she can either use as a postal <br/>
box or hide as an HH once she is able to get outside and box <br/>
again. (Altoids tins make great microboxes if you make your own <br/>
logbooks to fit in them.)<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad her request was posted on the LBNA site.  It was fun <br/>
putting together a package to send her and it made me <br/>
remember how lucky I am. It's easy to take for granted being able <br/>
to get out and about.<br/>

P.S.  I won't get into the P,F,X, etc. fray.  Looks like there are <br/>
almost as many ways of counting as there are letterboxers!<br/>
