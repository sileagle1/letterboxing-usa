&gt;  (Incidently, Mitch and all,<br/>
&gt;  I have tons of stamps, too, and even though I am married, <br/>
&gt;  adoration [at the very least], would be appropriate and acceptable!<br/>
<br/>
Deborah,<br/>
Why didn't you say so.  Please consider my love, adoration, and proposal to be<br/>
meant for you just as much as anyone else!!  Same rules apply, though.  After<br/>
the break-up (which is inevitable, considering that I'm already married) I get<br/>
all the rubber stamps.  Aren't I a hopeless romantic?  (OK... maybe just<br/>
hopeless!!)<br/>
<br/>
you also wrote<br/>
&gt;  I think _The Rubber Stamp Album_ was my first intro to RS, too!)<br/>
<br/>
Isn't it just the coolest book?  I've found several other good books related<br/>
to the artform, but none that quite capture so many aspects of it as this one.<br/>

&gt; Not to worry Deborah. He only loves me for my Harley and my stamps. Anyhow,<br/>
&gt;  there's always room for one more ingredient in the biker sandwich!!!<br/>
<br/>
I think our sandwich has turned into "pot luck".  But it's unfair to say I'm<br/>
only in love for the stamps... I had assumed there were some nice multicolored<br/>
ink pads involved, as well...<br/>
<br/>
Love and laughter to all of you...<br/>

Oh... well .... this I can count tonight....<br/>
 okay... I think I have 27 rainbow and multi-color inkpads...dye<br/>
or pigment, your choice! some of them might need re-inking...<br/>
but I've still got 'em!<br/>

<br/>
Uhoh, we are gonna start emumerating our dowry now, LOL.. I'll tell ya,<br/>
Deborah has me beat in the rainbow pad department, but I DO still have that<br/>
Harley to run me around to find and plant the letterboxes in style. So I guess<br/>
I'll have to be happy with a shorter line, LOL. Really, all I NEED is one good<br/>
one, and I was lucky enough to find that about 10 years ago! <br/>

Kisses and hugs to all "sandwich ingredients", and to all he wannabees.<br/>

Hmmmm... True. I'll have to see if I can memorialize this thought in rubber.<br/>
