I found another album or so of hers, but I think they were gospel songs.  The only place I was finally able to find another  reference to this work was by doing a search on "Robbie Robertson".  He is the one who asked Bonnie Jo Hunt to record the stuff for him.  He's done a lot of work with Native music.  It didn't mention a CD, but did speak of the TV show I mentioned, which sounded like it would air this fall sometime.  I believe it was called "The Native American" and was to be on TBS.  I don't know if it is supposed to be one program or a series. Good luck, and if I find any more I will certainly let you know.  Let me know as well if you find anything. Thanks!  --lunaryakketyact<br/>

Hi again Anna Lisa,<br/>
<br/>
I'm replying on list rather than privately in case anyone else was <br/>
interested in the Bonnie Jo Hunt music...<br/>
<br/>
It is on an album by Robbie Robertson called, "Music for Native <br/>
Americans," and you can get it through Amazon.com. You can also <br/>
listen to song clips to decide if you like the rest of the album.<br/>
<br/>
If I ever have any more little grifflets, maybe this album will come <br/>
to the labor room with me. It sounds very "earthy." =)<br/>
