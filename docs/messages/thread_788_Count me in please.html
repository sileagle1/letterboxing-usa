Country). I've been following the dialogue since catching the Country<br/>
Journal article.I was smitten and charmed by The Lure of Letterboxing!<br/>
Many thanks to Wendy! I am also keenly interested in attending The<br/>
Gathering. Since I am not so adept at the computer as most of you seem<br/>
to be, I thought I'd better try to get counted "In" through the e-mail<br/>
of which I am more familiar with. I will however try to join the chat<br/>
meeting once I've figured out what to do...<br/>
Robin  P0F0X0...but I've got the box,a pad and a small pile of erasers!!<br/>
