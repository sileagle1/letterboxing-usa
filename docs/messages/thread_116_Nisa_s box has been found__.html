My boyfriend, Mike, and I went to find your box on Monday.  Boy were we in for<br/>
a surprise!  We got there and started to figure out the clues when we couldn't<br/>
figure out the giants of the forest clue.  So we spent 2 hours roaming around<br/>
Shieling Forest before we ran into a local man walking his dog.  He clued us<br/>
in right away to what the giants were and we found the box just before dark.<br/>
On the wait out though, we got side tracked onto the "flower" trail and almost<br/>
got lost at dusk.  But we figured it out and made it home safely.  The mailbox<br/>
at the trail head didn't have any maps in it, so several times we went back to<br/>
the head to read the map on the board then returned to the hunt.  Maybe you<br/>
would consider putting a map of the forest on the web site in case this<br/>
happens to anyone else.  At any rate, we enjoyed the hunt ( even Mike did, I<br/>
dragged him out on a broken ankle [and he did curse me a lot along the way] )<br/>
but if it wasn't for him I may have given up sooner and not have found it<br/>
then. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yay!  You found it, Danielle!  I was worried that maybe you got lost and<br/>
couldn't find your way out!  I work at the hospital just down the road,<br/>
so I was checking out the parking lot in Shieling Forest for abandoned<br/>
cars.  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Good idea re:  the map.  Eric (my husband) wanted to make a map of the<br/>
trail to go with the clues so now I can put him to work!  I'll scan it<br/>
up and put it on my website and give it to Dan'l to put with my clues<br/>
(if that's okay!)by this weekend. on the L-USA website.<br/>
<br/>
If the weather is still cooperative this weekend, there just may be yet<br/>
another letterbox in Peterborough - this time on the Fit Trail by the<br/>
hospital!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Danielle for being my first visitor!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Nisa, for providing the focus for a lovely morning outing. <br/>
Another early start, and a chance to try out another diner breakfast: <br/>
the bacon, tomato, and cheddar cheese omelet at Caron's Restaurant <br/>
in Hillsborough was scrumptious.<br/>
<br/>
It's a real treat to walk through parks at this time of year; you <br/>
have them completely to yourself. Shieling Forest is lovely.  I'd <br/>
brought my Sorels just in case, but didn't need them. It was cold <br/>
enough to warrant gloves, though, and my hands were almost too cold <br/>
to scribble a note in your journal. The Giants were impressive, and <br/>
your box was just where it should have been. I stamped our journals <br/>
at 7:30, and headed back to Vermont.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
