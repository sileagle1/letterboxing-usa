We, the Elba Onions, found your Letchworth stamp in June and thought it was wonderful.  We're also planning some "lord of the Rings"-like stamps to put at the other end of the park.  If this Groveland Lunatic is seriously stealing boxes I'm going to be afraid to plant anymore!  I'm wondering if he really found it by accident or already had the clues.  It seems unlikely he found it by accident unless he witnessed someone else replacing it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, 2 things: 1)this is one more reason to use WOM clues, which I'm leaning toward more and more, and 2)if the Elba Onions are needed to hunt this guy down and shake him up a little, e-mail me off-list.  I know alot of farmers.........who have alot of manure................;)<br/>
