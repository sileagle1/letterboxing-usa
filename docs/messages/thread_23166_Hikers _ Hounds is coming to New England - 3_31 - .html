<br/>
  I am coming to NE for work and play the weekend of the 31st. Friday I will be Norton, MA all day as my company is opening another warehouse there. Friday evening I am hoping to dine in Boston and pick up a couple boxes there. Saturday evening I will be in Manchester, NH at "Strange Brew" with some friends to see an old favorite band of mine play there, Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen. You're welcome to put on your rockabilly dance shoes and stop on by. Sunday is open until about 2 then I've gotta boogie back home. I would love to meet up with people for exchanges if your schedule and location permit. Please email me off-list. Thanks!<br/>
