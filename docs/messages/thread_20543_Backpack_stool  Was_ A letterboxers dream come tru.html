How do they feel when you wear them, are you aware of the frame?<br/>
Are they heavy?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I should jump in here and tell you that these packs/chairs, albeit<br/>
really cool and convenient, do not hold up to big folks. I am 6'4"<br/>
tall, weigh in around 280, wear a 13EE boot, and, for some unfortunate<br/>
reason, intimidate a lot of people. I used one of these pack stools<br/>
once. Once was enough after I had to pack it out in pieces. Understand<br/>
that I'm not "out of shape" or obese, just plain big. My wife has a<br/>
folding stool like the one referred to without the pack and she loves it.<br/>
<br/>
Alright, enough from me. <br/>
