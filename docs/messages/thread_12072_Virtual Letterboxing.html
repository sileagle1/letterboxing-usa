not done anymore of them. Plus websites change and I think you need <br/>
to verifey the clues all the time if you do an online virtual box. <br/>
And yes, I did print out the different stamps on my color printer <br/>

accomplished and makes people who look through the book want to go <br/>
find them!<br/>
All I did was cut them down to size and use a glue stick to affix <br/>
them.<br/>

First of all, my name is David Salley, not Shelly.  No offense taken, <br/>
just correcting the mis-spelling.  I've been signing logbooks as "The <br/>
Pirate of Otter's Cove", a phrase which has significance only to <br/>
me. :D<br/>
<br/>
I received a Unicorn Journal <br/>
[http://www.runningpress.com/bookstore/product.asp?sku=754] as a <br/>
birthday present from a friend of mine several years ago.  I didn't <br/>
know what to do with it until I started letterboxing.  As Kat <br/>
mentioned, it's a complete journal, not just a stamp repository.  My <br/>
eventual goal is to have something like Indiana Jones' father had in <br/>
the third movie. :D  If I've used a map, it's in the journal.  <br/>
Drawing?  In the journal.  Cracked a secret code?  In the journal. <br/>
(Never know when you might need it again, right? :D)  Weather notes, <br/>
virtual letterboxes, commentaries on the hunt, etc.  It's all in <br/>
there.  I can't be the only one.  What do you folks put in your <br/>
journals?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Virtual letterboxes kept me sane when the snow kept falling outside!  I <br/>
think they are a lot of fun. But, I do agree that sometimes the websites <br/>
change and the clues get out of date.  I know this happened on one virtual <br/>
box.  I could never get past the second entry because the words they said to <br/>
look for were no where to be seen!<br/>
<br/>
We also just print out the stamps and glue stick them in the logbook.  We <br/>
keep a journal of all the clues too.  The virtual clue pages are my <br/>
favorites because they are covered with notes, trials and errors (especially <br/>
the MooMahh series [Deb is very helpful and understanding!])<br/>
<br/>
It's cold and rainy outside today.  I wish there were more virtual boxes to <br/>
hunt!  BeMa<br/>
