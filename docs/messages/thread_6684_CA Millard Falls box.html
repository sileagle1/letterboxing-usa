&gt; On Saturday 8/3 we found the Millard Falls box.  One of the landmarks<br/>
&gt; is greatly altered but we managed to find the box despite that.  It<br/>
&gt; was a lovely hike and we enjoyed discovering a part of Los Angeles we<br/>

The clue makes reference to a sign ("no shortcutting") which we did <br/>
not see at all.  We did see a post which probably once had a sign on <br/>
it and we used the post to find the box.   Jane<br/>

with no lettering on it.  But it's the only thing there that appears <br/>
to be added by humans.  We did plant Thompson Creek!  I want to plant <br/>
another one at the far east end of that trail but I must say that the <br/>
hike to Millard Falls is much prettier than our little trail.  I'll <br/>
get my family to check the Thompson Creek box and I won't tell them <br/>
there's been a visit so they'll be surprised.  Thanks for the info.<br/>
