Kathy thanks for your comments and well wishes for recovery of my dislocated <br/>
elbow. I now know what true physical pain is. <br/>
<br/>
I do hope that if you are any one else solves a mystery letterbox that they <br/>
will shout it from the roof tops. Not the solution of course but the fact <br/>
that they solved it. I can imagine my brain saying, "well, it is solveable, <br/>
I'd better work a little harder". Success of others can be encouraging. <br/>
<br/>
Valarie, I thought you had a very good and generous idea about guest room <br/>
sharing. I acknowledge that your area in now the letterbox "HEAVEN" but keep <br/>
your eyes on the mid-Atlantic Region. I think we are beginning to make a <br/>
serious challenge to that claim. : ) Hummm, I wonder how many letterboxes per <br/>
letterboxers we have? ; ) <br/>
<br/>
We could have a National letterbox day where each region hides as many as the <br/>
can and see who won,  or a letterbox Christmas count to see which region can <br/>
find the most in one day (but they would have to be new for the finder, you <br/>
couldn't find one you already found.) These are just fun thoughts to spark <br/>
more creativity.<br/>
<br/>
See ya out there,<br/>
