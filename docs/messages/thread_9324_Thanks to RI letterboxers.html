out looking for letterboxes.  I know that we have sometimes missed a <br/>
box that was really there -- it is quite easy to make mistakes when <br/>
tired.  I still appreciate other people mentioning that they didn't <br/>
find boxes, however, so that we plan alternative hunts in case boxes <br/>
suspected missing really aren't there.  It can be really <br/>
disappointing to hunt for hours for a box that everyone else knows is <br/>
missing, but it always helps to have another box in the area to find <br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
So good hunting to everyone headed out tomorrow in RI/CT/MA -- it <br/>
looks like good weather for once!<br/>
