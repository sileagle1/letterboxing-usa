I've always liked the long tall jar from American Science and Surplus<br/>
because it seals well and is transparent.  The one drawback is the<br/>
diameter is too small (at 2 1/2") for some of the larger stamps and you<br/>
need to find a rather narrow log book also.  It is more than tall<br/>
enough.  Its just a little too narrow.<br/>
<br/>
So at different times I've thought to myself, "I wish they had that<br/>
same jar, just shorter and wider.  That would be perfect."  Well, guess<br/>
what?  The long tall jar has been replaced by one that is shorter and<br/>
wider.  Instead of 5 3/4" X 2 1/2" dia. it is now 3 5/8" X 3 5/8" dia.<br/>
and its called the Honest Jar.  Do you suppose God heard me?  Why not?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the blurb says exactly this:<br/>
"Get 'em while they last, this kind goes fast." <br/>
ITEM NAME: Plastic Jar, 16 oz.<br/>
PRICE: $2.00/pkg(4)<br/>
STOCK NUMBER: 27109<br/>
<br/>
I ordered a bunch of 'em.  Some of you may want to do the same.  They're <br/>
feather light if you want to mail 'em to someone else it won't cost much<br/>
in postage.  Tupperware containers are usually around $2.50 so<br/>
this is a way better deal and IMO they work better.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the ordering info if you want to try these:<br/>

Within the Continental U.S., the charges for shipping and handling are<br/>
as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Merchandise Total  S&amp;H Fee<br/>
$00.00 to $20      $4.95<br/>
$20.01 to $35      $5.95<br/>
$35.01 to $50      $6.95<br/>
$50.01 to $75      $8.95<br/>
$75.01 to $100     $10.95<br/>
$100.01 and up     $12.95<br/>
<br/>
Outside the Continental United States (Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S.<br/>
Territories), payment must be by credit card only. Shipping and handling<br/>
will be actual cost plus $3.00 handling fee.<br/>
<br/>
Special conditions apply for bulk orders and all special handling. Call<br/>
(847) 982-0874 for informa<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with these if you try 'em.  I think even the old ones work<br/>
great.  These will work even better.  I like the fact that they are<br/>
transparent.  I'm thinking of putting a label on the inside facing out<br/>
that says something like, "Please do not disturb if you are not a<br/>
letterboxer."  Or maybe something like the label at<br/>

Have you tried this container yet?  I wonder if it's prone to cracking in really cold weather or under rocks?  It certainly looks like it's well sealed.<br/>

Yes, I put two of them out around November of last year.  I had to
dig them out of the ice
<br/>to check them and they are fine so far.  I realize this is not
very scientific and they may
<br/>yet fail some way, but so far so good and they are in a harsh environment. 
Our average
<br/>temps thru January are around 0 degrees F.  These containers are
made of a very durable
<br/>clear plastic material with plastic screw on lids.  They have
a little flex to them so it
<br/>is very unlikely that they will get brittle or crack IMO.
