boxes. Thanks for the idea!!!<br/>
<br/>
My husband loves Pirates and we do Renissance faires as Pirates sooo <br/>
he has taken this Pirate thing to a new level. <br/>
<br/>
Here is the new box clues called Cap'n Scarneck's Ahoy Matey!! Box. <br/>
<br/>
North Middleton Park, 1701 Waggoners Gap Road, Carlisle, PA 17013 <br/>
<br/>
Ahoy ye Scurvy Dogs! T' Dreaded Cap'n Scarneck has hidden some of his <br/>
booty on shore fer ye t' find. <br/>
<br/>
Now, I's know yer wonderin' who's Cap'n Scarneck an' what kind of <br/>
booty did he be hiden'?!? Well, he be a shameless Pirate who travels <br/>
all along the east coast hiden' his wench's carvins'. We don't know <br/>
too much else `bout him, `cept he's got a scar on his neck from a <br/>
firey battle and 3 salty sea dogs that help him pillage and plunder <br/>
everything in sight. Ye never know when `t Cap'n will show up!!! <br/>
<br/>
Now, `t first box - o - loot t' Cap'n Scarneck hid is in t' Ol' Town <br/>
of Carlisle. On `t outskirts of town, `t Cap'n an his Wench docked <br/>
their boat. ( Arrg....t' Cap'n wasn't pleased t' see t' No Pets <br/>
sign... `t salty dogs had to stay at home). He got out of his boat an <br/>
walked 40 paces from t' waters edge along t' wooded side, on his <br/>
starboard side ther' be a row of trees. He be walkin' 5 steps from t' <br/>
blacktop toward t' tree with a small V that starts about 3 feet up. <br/>
Behind that tree on t' ground be t' treasure, under some bark. Then <br/>
t' Cap'n quickly ran back to his boat an' they took off down t' <br/>
creek. Now, be careful ther' be a lot of other pirates launchin' <br/>
their boats an' they might be lookin' t' steal ye treasure!! <br/>
<br/>
Happy Treasure Hunting!! <br/>
