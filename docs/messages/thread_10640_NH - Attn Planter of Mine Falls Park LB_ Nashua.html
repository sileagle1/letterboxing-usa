Hi,<br/>
I am chairperson for the Mine Falls Park Advisory Committee in <br/>
Nashua, NH.  I just discovered posted on your website a Letterbox for <br/>
Mine Falls Park and there is no contact person.  I was delighted to <br/>
find your website and to see some of the very high quality <br/>
clues...but the one for Mine Falls Park does not meet that standard.  <br/>
I would appreciate knowing who posted this letterbox to work with <br/>
them for an improved letterbox set up in the park.  Could you please <br/>
give me the contact information?<br/>
<br/>
If you chose not give the contact information; could you please <br/>
remove this letterbox and allow the committee to create one that <br/>
matches the standards of others on your webiste?<br/>
Thank you very much for your help,<br/>

looked different and would make quite an interesting challenge.  <br/>
Looks like a clever use of landmarks and presents a bit of a map <br/>
reading task for some.<br/>
<br/>
The box owners information appear there clearly.  I might be nice if <br/>
one of the web masters drops them a note.  The box owner can then <br/>
visit with the committee and explain what his goals are by setting <br/>
this box ( intro for newbies, a step up in challenge from the usual <br/>
trail right trail left clues?) <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the victim here is the committee and someone with an agenda <br/>
against them? <br/>

The stamp is wonderful!<br/>
I do know the park is scheduled for major work. They  are planning to change <br/>
some of the water pathways for a fish ladder. The box must have been "found" <br/>
accidentally.<br/>
Too bad to lose this nice LB. I hope it can be relocated.<br/>
