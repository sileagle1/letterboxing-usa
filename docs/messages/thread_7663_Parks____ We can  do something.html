<br/>
As someone who works at a wildlife sanctuary, I can certainly say that most <br/>
parks and preserves are there so that people can find a place in nature,so <br/>
that they will fall in love with it and realize why it is so important to <br/>
preserve it. Unfortunately, because people seek out these areas as the few <br/>
places that are wild and natural, there is the very real risk of <br/>
"over-loving" a landscape.<br/>
<br/>
By spending time volunteering to help the staff out occasionally, <br/>
letterboxers can not only do wonders for their reputation, but also go a very <br/>
long way in preserving the places they love.<br/>
<br/>
If I may give an example...I work at a 2,200 acre sanctuary with 11 <br/>
buildings, three vehicles and a calculated 25 miles of trails....and only two <br/>
property workers to take care of it all. We had a group of 15 students come <br/>
in from Boston University for two days to do community service before the <br/>
semester started. In that time they cleaned, weeded and pruned all the formal <br/>
gardens, rebuilt stone walls, filled the dumpster with bags of trash picked <br/>
up from the roadsides and on and on. This would have taken our staff months <br/>
and months to have gotten time to do all that while simultaneously trying to <br/>
teach educational  programs, run summer camp, fix trucks, paint the building, <br/>
fund-raise etc. They were like angels.<br/>
<br/>
I really would encourage people to give a bit of time alone or in LB groups. <br/>
My colleagues already knows that most letterboxers try very hard to tread <br/>
lightly (and I have suspicions that some of my colleagues at other <br/>
sanctuaries have taken up LB too), but we do need to build a stronger <br/>
reputation of being responsible so that other wild areas are not closed to us.<br/>
<br/>
May I suggest a possible LB gathering at my sanctuary sometime to discuss it?<br/>

<br/>
This is an excellent idea! At the same time letterboxers can learn <br/>
how the park service trys to protect and perseve the park for all to <br/>
enjoy. Another option is volunteering a couple of times a year. We do <br/>
this and my kids enjoy helping out at the local park.<br/>

</p><p>I think a combination of a work party and a "mini-summit" at your wildlife sanctuary would be a great idea. I know many letterboxers participate in trail and park maintenance already. A day of putting ideas on the table for all to consider while giving something substantive back surely sets the tone for other efforts in the same positive direction that can take place anywhere. Grassroots efforts like this can't help but reinforce the fact that letterboxers are also good stewards of the environment. Please keep us posted.
