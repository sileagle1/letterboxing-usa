&gt;The origional intent of<br/>
&gt;the HH exchange was sort of like a grab bag. You bring a HH, toss it in a<br/>
&gt;basket and take another in exchange to hide where ever your letterboxing<br/>
&gt;travels bring you.<br/>
<br/>
I'm generally against event box proliferation and promiscuous hitchhiker <br/>
stamping, but I think the idea of having a hitchhiker hostel at gatherings <br/>
is great. The problem is that most people don't understand how a hostel <br/>
works -- or they choose to disregard the instructions. In a hitchhiker <br/>
hostel, you can only exchange a hitchhiker you've brought with you for <br/>
another. If you don't leave one, you can't take one. When hitchhikers are <br/>
in a box or laid out on a picnic table at a gathering along with the event <br/>
stamps, it's easy for people to get confused.<br/>
<br/>
I think that a good way to approach it is to hide a hitchhiker hostel <br/>
somewhere nearby just for the day, and then distribute clues to it (along <br/>
with the explanation of a hitchhiker hostel). The planter of the hostel <br/>
just needs one HH to seed the box (make one if you don't have one, or just <br/>
ask Amanda from Seattle to send you one <g>).<br/>
<br/>
And here's a thought about event stamp proliferation: there's no reason <br/>
that the gathering's organizers can't hide some of the special stamps that <br/>
have been getting mailed around to various events. A letterbox is a <br/>
letterbox, whether it's permanent, private or only hidden for a single day. <br/>
You don't have to create elaborate clues -- try writing a clue in a single <br/>
sentence or as a haiku or some other minimalist form. It takes a bit of <br/>
additional planning and effort, but I think it would make it a lot more fun <br/>
for everyone.<br/>

Thanks Silent Doug for your thoughts on that.  Since we're gathering <br/>
at my place this weekend, you've given me some great ideas.  All <br/>
righty!!!  I've got the event stamps &amp; a bunch of hitchhikers and <br/>
will try to be creative with them.  Thanks for the ideas.  =-)  I had <br/>
been stamping all those hitchhikers in my book at events, but just <br/>
only counting the one I exchanged.  So now it'll be even more fun, <br/>
well hopefully.  =-)  <br/>
<br/>
A-Bear and so excited about Saturday =-)<br/>

around concerning gatherings and such.....<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think part of the problem that causes these<br/>
'misunderstandings' is the 'No Rules' concept of Letterboxing as a whole.<br/>
I'm not saying that's a bad thing, I'm just saying that without, at least,<br/>
accepted guidelines, people can not really be faulted for doing what they<br/>
do. How can you chastise a person for bringing 25 boxes to an event and<br/>
causing a feeding frenzy by doing so?  How can you chastise someone for<br/>
bringing a bunch of hitchhikers to a gathering and passing them out to<br/>
others to plant?  How can you chastise anyone for anything is people are not<br/>
taught this hobby, but beaten over the head with the 'Stoopid' club when<br/>
they do something against 'Accepted practices'? What is common accepted<br/>
practices now a days was not common accepted practices 4 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I think, personally, (And this is my opinion and we all what know opinions<br/>
are like right? Everyone's got one and they usually stink.) that we need to<br/>
have a little more control and a lot less flying off the handle.<br/>
<br/>
I personally love the idea of a Hostel at an event for Hitchhikers and I<br/>
think it should be handled by someone at the event.  A 'deck clerk' if you<br/>
will.  Just like the boxes at an event. I, myself, prefer to have them<br/>
hidden, much like we did at Fright Fest '03 and not spread all over a table<br/>
to everyone to just stamp into, unless they are traveling event stamps, or<br/>
other special stamps.<br/>
<br/>
But, as I always say, these are just my opinions and not meant as a 'You<br/>
Must Do It This Way!'  (grin)<br/>

It would save so much time...the last few events we've been to, we have <br/>
literally spent hours exchanging and stamping in to everything on a table, and then <br/>
never get to go out and find the local boxes!<br/>
