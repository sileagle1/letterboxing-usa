<br/>
Thank you for sharing your day with us - it sounds absolutely ideal. <br/>
This is not the first time I've said I wished I lived on the west <br/>
coast. (I did spend four years at Berkeley long ago.) But then. I'd <br/>
miss out on all the great east coast letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
This is starting to sound like the Beach Boys' song California Girls. <br/>
There it is - you get to be middle-aged and instead of girls, you're <br/>
babbling away about east and west coast letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
Oh well! We take our pleasures as we can. I drink a glass of stout <br/>
with you and toast your adventures in the Columbia River Gorge.<br/>

Excelsior,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings, Friends!!<br/>
Thought I'd try and share a bit of my beautiful day w/ you... It was a <br/>
Gorgeous day here in the 'Silicone Forest'... and I had nothing on my agenda.<br/>
<br/>
What could be better to do on a Gorgeous afternoon in Portland, than to visit <br/>
The Gorge?  So, I headed out to the magnificent Columbia River Gorge, a quick <br/>
30 miles East on I-84, to Multnomah Falls.  I quickly verified the survival <br/>
of my letterboxes at Multnomah and Wahkeena Falls.  Both are safe and sound <br/>
and still undiscovered.  I know some have tried and failed to find them, but <br/>
they ARE there.  The clues are a bit harder than my others, but they are easy <br/>
to get to.  (Conversely, the boxes that I make you sweat for are easy to find <br/>
if you make the effort.)<br/>
<br/>
Multnomah Falls Letterbox is in a nice place with a great veiw of the <br/>
falls... close enough that the roar of the falling water is very prominent... <br/>
yet, it is usually secluded and private... no small statement considering <br/>
that over 2 million people visit this magnificent 620-foot double-tiered <br/>
waterfall each year!!<br/>
<br/>
Wahkeena Falls Letterbox requires you to hike up about a 10th of a mile or so <br/>
to the bridge that crosses over about 10 yards from the very base of the <br/>
largest drop in this 242-foot multi-tiered fall that zig-zags its way down <br/>
the cliffside.  The facefull of cool spray you'll receive as you look up into <br/>
the torrent is guaranteed to provide a rush!!<br/>
<br/>
After visiting these two letterboxes, I was warmed up for a real adventure!!  <br/>
And I had just the plan...  I followed the Historic Columbia River Scenic <br/>
Highway a couple of miles to Horsetail Falls.  I paused a moment at the base <br/>
of this beautiful 176-foot plummit and then hiked up to my Horsetail Falls <br/>
Letterbox  Then, I continued on to Pony Tail Falls.<br/>
<br/>
At Pony Tail, the trail goes back behind the falls.  It's a very magical <br/>
place!!  Continuing down the trail, I reached the area where you can look out <br/>
off the cliffs into The George.  It's a breathtaking view, but be <br/>
warned...there are no guardrails!  Young children should stay on the main <br/>
trail.  As a reminder, there is a monument to a young man who fell to his <br/>
death nearby.  It is near this area (away from the cliffs, close to the main <br/>
trail) that I've located the Ponytail Falls Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
This is as far as I had ever gone along this trail.  It's nearly a mile and a <br/>
half of gradually inclined hiking, so I'd been glad to get this far, in the <br/>
past.  I've been hiking quite a bit over the last year, though, in no small <br/>
part due to the fact that I've become a letterboxer!!  I realized that the <br/>
trail seemed much easier now than it had when I placed these boxes last <br/>
summer.<br/>
<br/>
So, today I continued on.  I wound my way down into the breathtaking Oneonta <br/>
Gorge.  Here, the pleasant little Oneonta Creek has flowed since prehistoric <br/>
times, cutting a narrow valley through the mountainous basalt flows.  It's a <br/>
beautiful hike through the lodgepole pines and ferns to a little bridge that <br/>
crosses over the creek near a small waterfall.  Then I began working my way <br/>
back up the other side.<br/>
<br/>
I won't pretend that I made it to Triple Falls with much dignity.  I was <br/>
breathing heavily and covered in sweat.  My hair must have looked as though <br/>
I'd just been through a car wash!!  I was now nearly 3 miles uptrail from <br/>
Horsetail Falls.  The second I came up over that last hump, however, I knew <br/>
it had been worth the effort.<br/>
<br/>
I looked down onto this stunning segmented waterfall, and forgot all about my <br/>
aching feet and my sweaty backpack.  There are not three falls here, as the <br/>
name might suggest, but a single fall of triplet form... having worn three <br/>
distinct grooves into the basalt which spout 100 to 135 feet into a pool <br/>
below.  <br/>
<br/>
Over the falls, a narrow wooden bridge allows access to the creek above.  <br/>
Here, the water flows gently over a huge bed of beautiful, rounded, <br/>
moss-covered boulders.  I quickly found my way out onto them and splashed my <br/>
face with the clear, ice-cold water.  It tasted pure and fresh, and was so <br/>
invigorating that I had to take off my shoes and socks and dip my aching feet <br/>
in, as well.  I was tempted to go wading, but the water was too cold, even on <br/>
such a warm, sunny day... consisting as it does of snow-melt from nearby <br/>
Larch Mountain mixed with fresh spring water.<br/>
<br/>
This would have been the perfect place for a picnic, had I brought one.  <br/>
Instead, I settled for some mixed nuts and Gatorade (and a few more sips of <br/>
Oneonta Creek water) and began looking for a spot to hide the TRIPLE FALLS <br/>
LETTERBOX....<br/>
<br/>
I soon found the perfect hiding place and jotted down a few notes.  I'm <br/>
usually hesitant to use a rotting tree stump as a primary landmark... but <br/>
since this one was about four feet in diameter and twenty feet tall, I <br/>
figured it wasn't going anywhere soon.<br/>
<br/>
By now, I was well rested... refreshed, even.  For fun, I lied to myself, <br/>
thinking I could almost make it another 5 miles to Larch Mountain from here.  <br/>
Instead, I took one last sip of the icy water and headed back down the way <br/>
I'd came.  Naturally, the way back was easier than the way up... at times I <br/>
even jogged down the path.  (Must have been the water!!)<br/>
<br/>
I'm safely at home again, now... sipping on a bottle of Bridgeport Black <br/>
Strap Stout in celebration of today's accomplishments.  I have confirmed that <br/>
each box of the Columbia River Gorge Waterfall Series is still in place, and <br/>
have added a fifth box to the series for those who are willing to take the <br/>
5.5 mile round-trip hike to Triple Falls.  I'll try and get the clues posted <br/>
tomorrow.  I'll keep them easy... I wouldn't want anyone to take this trek <br/>
and return empty-handed.  There is plenty of room for growth in this series <br/>
of letterboxes.  I've been told there are a total of 77 waterfalls in the <br/>
area.  I hope you can forgive me if I don't live long enough to make a <br/>
letterbox for each of them...<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing...<br/>

My $0.02USD: Hikers:  Be careful where you drink untreated/unfiltered water<br/>
nowadays.  If you pick up giardia or some parasite, the water *will* make<br/>
you jog...and not in a good way.  I know it's tempting to drink from an<br/>
ice-cold stream, but it's sort of like playing an "intestinal disfunction<br/>
lottery!"  You could do it for quite a while before you hit the malady<br/>
jackpot!  There aren't usually a lot of viruses in North America's water,<br/>
but there are other things (like the aforementioned giardia) that are<br/>
fairly common that can knock you out for the count.  It's prudent to<br/>
consider bringing your own water and/or filter local water if you're going<br/>
to be out hiking for multiple days, etc.  Folks who are getting up there in<br/>
age, and those with impaired immune systems should be especially careful.<br/>
OK...enough "filter it" preaching!<br/>
<br/>
On topic, however, that sounds like a great hike!  I'm usually stuck in the<br/>
office on gorgeous days. :(  And there are no waterfalls of that splendor<br/>
nearby.  I'm jealous!  Very jealous!<br/>
