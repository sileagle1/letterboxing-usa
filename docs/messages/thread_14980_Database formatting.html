Thanks for taking the initiative on this.  I think this is a great <br/>
idea and hope it catches on with the group so that it becomes truly <br/>
useful.<br/>
<br/>
One question I have is whether the table is intended to record <br/>
individual visits to a letterbox, or the current status for each <br/>
box.  (i.e. should the Letterbox name be a key for the table?)<br/>
<br/>
With this first use, each new box visitor would locate (or add if not <br/>
present) the record for the box they visited and update this record <br/>
with the latest status.  The advantage would be that there is one <br/>
record to find for the most recent status of the box you are <br/>
interested in, on the downside we'd lose the history of the comments <br/>
section, and people might conflict on concurrent edits to the same <br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
With the second use, any given box could have multiple entries.  This <br/>
avoids conflicts (entries would rarely be edited by multiple people <br/>
at the same time), and keeps the history (which is nice).<br/>
<br/>
My personal opinion is that this latter use is the more interesting <br/>
as it will serve to also illustrate how active the boxes. <br/>
<br/>
This use though will place more of an emphasis on the date column.  <br/>
We're currently using quite a mixture of date formats. I think it <br/>
will make the data much more useful if we standardize on a date <br/>
format.  Unfortunately it looks as though the Yahoo table columns are <br/>
just test strings.  This doesn't lead to good sorting behavior for <br/>
dates.  Here are a couple of ideas:<br/>
<br/>
 o Standardize on a date format like:  YYYY-MM-DD<br/>
<br/>
   + This will sort the dates in a reasonable fashion in Yahoo.<br/>
   - In practice though it will be nearly impossible to keep all the<br/>
     records consist.<br/>
<br/>
 o Periodically download the data, scrub it, then upload the scrubbed<br/>
   data.<br/>
<br/>
   + This approach could be used to enforce consistency in other<br/>
     columns as well.  For example, the Status column you mentioned.<br/>
   o I'm not sure whether Yahoo will support this or not.<br/>
   - Updates made while the data is being scrubbed might be lost<br/>
     if one isn't careful.<br/>
   - It's a periodic maintenance task to make this happen.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?  BTW, I'd be happy to help with the maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

easy or hard for young children. Were the clues clear or hard to <br/>

should be saved for the talk list. For the database, it's "just <br/>

<br/>
Please do not include hints (or spoilers) to clues that the <br/>
placer has made intentionally vague. If you visit a mystery box<br/>
in conjunction with other boxes you should probably just list <br/>
the year and month and not the date for the mystery box.<br/>
