                    <div class="plaintext-content">Located in Chillicothe, Ohio (Ross County). The general area where <br/>
this letterbox is located offers a beautiful view of the city and the <br/>
Paint Creek and Scioto River valleys. It is also the final resting <br/>
place of four of Ohio's governors: Thomas Worthington, Duncan <br/>
McArthur, Edward Tiffin, and William Allen. The letterbox was placed <br/>
on 8-26-02 by Salamander. DIFFICULTY: EASY.    CLUES: Begin by <br/>
finding a large, square, stone-walled enclosure. From this <br/>
enclosure's northwest corner, go 43 paces (1 pace=2 steps) at 7 <br/>
degrees. You should be standing at the top of a set of stone steps. <br/>
At the westernmost edge of the bottom step,take a bearing of 338 <br/>
degrees and go 21 paces. Are you standing beside a large stump? If <br/>
you were to look inside this stump, you would find what you are <br/>
seeking (please check to make sure that no wild critters are calling <br/>
the place home; none were when the box was placed).<br/>
