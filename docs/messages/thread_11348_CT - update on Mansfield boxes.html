Mansfield meca of letterboxing today. We visited the Pink Panther series <br/>
(all in good shape - beautiful area to hike in), Air Mail (hey Chuck, you're <br/>
log book is almost full!), Tiger Cubs at Mansfield Middle School, Plane <br/>
Spotter (pretty wet, we dried it out, this log book is also almost full), <br/>
and Bed Rug (also wet and now dried out). We had a great time, though we <br/>
were sad not to have found any hitchhikers. Some day! Be sure to visit the <br/>
new box in Hebron at Gay City - it was planted by Jessie and Wandering Frog <br/>
for my 21st b-day. Have a great weekend everyone, it's finally time to take <br/>
advantage of this beautiful weather!<br/>
