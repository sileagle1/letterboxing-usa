<br/>
Someone once said something like:  "the future is uncertain -- eat dessert <br/>
first!"<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry that you missed out on the cookies 'cause it is an extremely yummy <br/>
recipe!<br/>
<br/>
You can find it in the Sweet Potato Queens Book of Love or their latest, The <br/>
Sweet Potato Queens Big A** Cookbook and Financial Planner.  For those of <br/>
you who are unfamiliar with the Sweet Potato Queens you are truly missing <br/>
something!  These books are a riot!  This is what they mean by laugh out <br/>
loud funny.  I should know.  I was listening to one on audio book while <br/>
working out at the gym and I surely did laugh out loud.  Now, I may be <br/>
easily influenced, after all, I've gotten funny looks when I listen to the <br/>
romance novels too, but, I've recommended these books to both my book clubs <br/>
and they've loved them!!<br/>
<br/>
I'm even thinking of dedicating a series of boxes to the Sweet Potato Queens <br/>
basic food groups:  sweet, salty, fried and au gratin.  I, of course, would <br/>
add chocolate to that list.  I will not, however, under any circumstances be <br/>
making a box representing the sweet potato queen "promise".  Those who have <br/>
read the books will know what I mean....  That doesn't mean I won't try and <br/>
use it one day -- I just won't carve a picture of it!...<br/>
<br/>
So, after you all run out and buy the books -- you will have a great time <br/>
and some really delicious recipes!!  Having said all that -- I can sneak the <br/>
recipe to you off list if you would like it.  But, if you know the words of <br/>
Jill Conner Brown -- she didn't write these books so people could swap them <br/>
with their friends.  You need to buy, buy, buy them and keep these poor <br/>
women in glitter, flowing red wigs and up to date on all their plastic <br/>
surgery needs!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!  And, once you eat all these cookies (the recipe makes several <br/>
dozen!) I will see you on the trail where you will be busily trying to work <br/>
off all the calories to make room for the Chocolate Stuff and knock you <br/>
naked margaritas!  BeMa<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  This book will give you inspiration!  Once you see what these gals fit <br/>
in their purses to bring to the movies (freeeetos, dip and margaritas) you <br/>
will never look at your backpack the same way again!  The possibilities are <br/>
endless!...<br/>

&gt;Dear BeMa,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We had a great time, too. We can put names to about a half<br/>
&gt;dozen names and faces--pretty good for me! Hope to see many<br/>
&gt;familiar faces on the trail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I heard great things about your Butterfinger cookies, but they<br/>
&gt;were all gone by the time I got around to dessert :-( Can you post<br/>
&gt;the recipe or share it with me off list?<br/>

&gt; &gt; What a great time we all had at the Riverbend gathering!  It was<br/>
&gt;so nice to<br/>
&gt; &gt; meet everyone and to see that they were truly excited to meet<br/>
&gt;us too (that's<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Sally Fields part "they like me, they really like me!"<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I will admit -- we were a little nervous about going.  We were<br/>
&gt;already<br/>
&gt; &gt; running late 'cause of Da's tennis (the second match of which<br/>
&gt;got rained out<br/>
&gt; &gt; -- poor Da!)  We parked in the lot where everyone else had not<br/>
&gt;parked and<br/>
&gt; &gt; wandered across the field.  At first we didn't see anyone.  And<br/>
&gt;then -- the<br/>
&gt; &gt; migration began.  We saw a column of people making their<br/>
&gt;way over.  Did they<br/>
&gt; &gt; seem letterboxerish?  Did they have backpacks?  Ah heck --<br/>
&gt;they were all<br/>
&gt; &gt; carrying lots of food so we figured we were going to join that<br/>
&gt;picnic no<br/>
&gt; &gt; matter what!  With a tentative "are you all boxers" we joined the<br/>
&gt;melee!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So many logbooks and so many stamps -- the ink was flying!<br/>
&gt;Be took a moment<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get over his shyness but Ma got right in the mood.  Once<br/>
&gt;again, off she<br/>
&gt; &gt; went, introducing herself to lots of adults I probably didn't even<br/>
&gt;get to<br/>
&gt; &gt; meet.  For all those she spoke to -- believe only half of what<br/>
&gt;she tells<br/>
&gt; &gt; you!  Unless it's about Ha, and then it is probably true!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now, I am one who is normally really bad at remembering<br/>
&gt;names and faces.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And now it was names, faces, trail names, stamps, boxes<br/>
&gt;placed.....HELP!<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, for those I met on Saturday (and forced to smell my new<br/>
&gt;leather logbook<br/>
&gt; &gt; -- just like the stable minus the manure--) please don't be<br/>
&gt;offended if I<br/>
&gt; &gt; walk right by you on the trail or try and introduce ourselves<br/>
&gt;again.  It's a<br/>
&gt; &gt; problem -- and I'm working on it.  I can guarantee though, if I<br/>
&gt;meet you and<br/>
&gt; &gt; you offer me a yodel, hoho, or any other chocolate covered<br/>
&gt;confection --<br/>
&gt; &gt; your face will forever be imprinted in whatever Mommy brain<br/>
&gt;cells I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; left!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As others have said -- it was a great experience!  Just like<br/>
&gt;meeting people<br/>
&gt; &gt; you feel you already know through posts and log book entries.<br/>
&gt;But now you<br/>
&gt; &gt; get to see what they really look like and how they really are<br/>
&gt;(now be honest<br/>
&gt; &gt; -- were we louder than you expected?!...)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The camaraderie was wonderful!  The event stamps beautiful!<br/>
&gt;The food was<br/>
&gt; &gt; plentiful.  Thank you to those who remembered to bring<br/>
&gt;utensils -- it could<br/>
&gt; &gt; have been very messy!  Thank you to whomever brought the<br/>
&gt;KFC -- something Be<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually ate (did you see how skinny he is?  He eats nothing!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We didn't get a chance to find the new Riverbend boxes or to<br/>
&gt;snag the ones<br/>
&gt; &gt; we have yet to find.  We'll save that for another day!  We were<br/>
&gt;grateful to<br/>
&gt; &gt; make it back to the car before the rain. Ever since that fateful<br/>
&gt;trip to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Statue of Liberty in that tremendous downpour Miss Ma has<br/>
&gt;panicked at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought of heavy rain (and refuses to visit anymore national<br/>
&gt;monuments...)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So thank you to everyone and Gaabriel for organizing the whole<br/>
&gt;thing.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; had a great time!  BeMa<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
