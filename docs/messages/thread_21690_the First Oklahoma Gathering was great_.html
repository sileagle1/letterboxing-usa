I wanted to brag a few minutes on Mandy.  She planned our Cabin <br/>
Fever Gathering last Saturday.  It was great.<br/>
<br/>
There were at least 22 actual letterboxers there and 15 or more <br/>
others.  Not bad for a first try.  We even had visitors from Rhode <br/>
Island, Wanda and Pete traveled down.<br/>
<br/>
There were aprox. 50 boxes hid for the event, food, prizes and a lot <br/>
of visiting.<br/>
<br/>
Mandy had done so much planning and preparing.  She had many <br/>
surprises and had solicited some of you for boxes.  Thanks for those <br/>
that sent them.  They were fun.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was very encouraging and we're pumped to "get out there <br/>
and box."<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again Mandy, it wouldn't have happened without you!<br/>

I'm so glad our neighbors to the north had a fun<br/>
and successful Gathering.  Maybe next year some<br/>
of you can make our Texas Event and we can make yours.<br/>
