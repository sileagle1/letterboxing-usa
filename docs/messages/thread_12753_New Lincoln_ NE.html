This saint was a fisherman and became one of the twelve apostles. Jesus said<br/>
to him "You are a rock &amp; I'll build my church upon you. I will give you the<br/>
keys to the kingdom of heaven." Do you know who it is?<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Take 33 to Prescott. Go to Bishop Heights Park. From the sign<br/>
follow the sidewalk passed the playscape. As you see the blue stairs take<br/>
the dirt path on your right. The box is in the base of the tree on the left<br/>
