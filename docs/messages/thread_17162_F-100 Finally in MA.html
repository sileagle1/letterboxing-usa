<br/>
The box finally arrived this week. I've got to work<br/>
early Saturday morning, so the only day I am available<br/>
for exchanging and whatnot is this Sunday morning,<br/>
before 11 AM. After 11, Rachel will be home until<br/>
about 1. To all of you that tramped out here last week<br/>
to discover that it wasn't here yet, please do come<br/>
back, and to all of the rest that got my message in<br/>
time, come on down! My time being limited, I'm going<br/>
to invite y'all to our house. Seeing as how it was<br/>
full of letterboxers last week, with no ill effects,<br/>
and the weather is going to be horrible, this seems to<br/>
be our best option. :-) If you want to attend, send me<br/>
an email, I'll send you directions. I'll be sending<br/>
the box out to the next on the list early next week.<br/>
<br/>
Mike S.<br/>
