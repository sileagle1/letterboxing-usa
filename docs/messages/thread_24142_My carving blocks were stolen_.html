Right, Mosey.  It occurs to me that maybe the delivery person is an<br/>
addicted letterboxer and is hiding all packages!  Is there a 12 step<br/>

I have called Fedex and the company and they will ship another one with a<br/>

I got PZcut and mastercarve. The company said it was in a brown box. <br/>

porch, in our yard (front or back) It is pretty clear of anything except<br/>
grass and sopme flowers and shrubs. he said it was definitely the frnt porch<br/>
but it was my neighbors porch. I was able to get with this neighbor and she<br/>
had it for me. I did get it back. Yay!<br/>
