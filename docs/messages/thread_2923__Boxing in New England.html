Wanda just called from NH to say she is fast approaching the 400 mark on her letterbox F count (probably spurred on by my having told her I passed that mark myself - a bit of spousal rivalry!).  In addition to her recent "serendipitous" letterbox visit with the Kuzyks in Bethel, ME, she just yesterday took another sidetrip from hiking on the Appalachian Trail to get the Tuckerman and Scout letterboxes in NH which are in fine shape but lonely from lack of visitors - they are in a great place to visit if you get the chance.<br/>

I recently enjoyed visiting Bonnie's boxes closeby I91 in MA while traveling to Northfield, MA and before that The Proposal in Sutton, MA and 4 Cousins in Pomfret, CT.  Many thanks to all who have made the effort to place these boxes in such interesting places to visit!<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing,<br/>
