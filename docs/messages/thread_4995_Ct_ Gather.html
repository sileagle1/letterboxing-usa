three boxes on a Hike around the Head but wish to ask if anyone else has <br/>
already planned it, I can do a different loop. I plan to put the clues <br/>
here for all to copy  a week before the gather and the boxes out on that <br/>
morning, so don't even go looking before !!<br/>

would have been Bla!!! Grin<br/>
Really a great big thanks to Chuck and Chickabirdie for getting <br/>
everything so well put together. I know others helped plant and you guys <br/>
did a wonderful job on all three trails. The beautiful new stamps that <br/>
seemed to pop out of no where are breathtaking. The Kiwi's both their <br/>
'farewell ' stamp and the one Jay did in their honor,  ahh wish I could <br/>
do that !!  Loved Maddy's butterfly scarf.  woof woof .<br/>
For me, it was perfect, and the friendships get stronger.<br/>
Happy butterfly days,<br/>
