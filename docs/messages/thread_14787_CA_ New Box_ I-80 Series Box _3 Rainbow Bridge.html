Clues: Pretty easy<br/>
Difficulty: The toughest of the 5 in this series. You'll need to climb up <br/>
some big boulders but it's totally doable even in sandals (but NOT in winter when <br/>
the road will probably be closed.)<br/>
<br/>
After getting Box #4 at the Donner Lake Overlook Vista Point, take the Donner <br/>
Lake exit. Go right and proceed downhill. Go right at the stop sign. Take the <br/>
nice, curvy road and enjoy this beautiful view. If you went to Lake Tahoe <br/>
before Interstate 80 was built in the late 60s, this is the road you would have <br/>
taken and you would have crossed the Rainbow Bridge. If you look to your left <br/>
and up the mountain as you proceed, you will see its beautiful curves in the <br/>
distance along with the train shed which protects the trains from winter <br/>
avalanches even today.<br/>
<br/>
Turn into the Vista Point immediately before reaching the bridge and park. <br/>
After enjoying a momentous view of Donner Lake--to the box: From the parking <br/>
lot, proceed to the southern end. On your right is a natural black rock wall that <br/>
peters out to nothing in front of you. Make your way up and to the right <br/>
climbing up the large rocks to the glacier-flattened granite where you'll see a <br/>
single pine. From this pine, look back towards Donner Lake. Now, turn around 180 <br/>
degrees and you will see, what appears to be a bush. It is, in fact, a <br/>
hearty, old, craggy, low-spreading pine up on the rocks. Make your way to this pine, <br/>
revearing its ability to have withstood the harsh weather of this site. Take <br/>
care not to disturb it. On the south side of this pine, on a level, sandy <br/>
ledge, under the edge of the tree's branches are 3 or 4 rocks hiding the <br/>
letterbox.<br/>
