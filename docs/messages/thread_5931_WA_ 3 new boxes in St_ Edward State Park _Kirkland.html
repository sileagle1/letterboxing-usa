Notes about the park:<br/>
This site was once used by Native Americans while fishing the area. <br/>
In the late 1920s, the archbishop of Seattle donated the property to <br/>
the Diocese of Seattle for use as a seminary by the Sulpician Order <br/>
of Catholic Priests. In 1931, St. Edward Seminary was constructed. In <br/>
the fall of 1977, because of declining enrollment and changes in the <br/>
education of seminarians, the diocese sold 316 acres, including the <br/>
seminary, to the state for use as a state park. In 1978, the property <br/>
was dedicated and received its current name.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Letterbox Clues:<br/>
Park near the pool, and then head to the visitor kiosk to pick up a <br/>
map. The kiosk is located roughly west of the pool parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
 From the kiosk, head north through a parking lot and find the <br/>
signpost for a trail. It has a map of the park, a sign indicating you <br/>
should clean up after your dog, and a "pack it in, pack it out" sign.<br/>
<br/>
Follow that trail, and soon you will find a small trail sign that <br/>
indicates you are on the North Trail. You will walk quite a <br/>
distance...<br/>
<br/>
When you see logs on the ground, bordering the trail's right side, <br/>
watch for a tree with a hollow center. From that tree, take 30 steps.<br/>
<br/>
Look to your left, there should be a log, slightly off the trail in <br/>
the woods. The One Legged Duck letterbox is on the far side of that <br/>
log, covered by a piece of rotten wood.<br/>
After stamping in, go back to the trail and continue on in the <br/>
direction you were going.<br/>
Eventually, you will come to a point where you can see the water, and <br/>
the trail does a mild branching off -- just stick to the main trail. <br/>
You will be walking along the lake for quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
The trail will make a left turn away from the water, and go up a <br/>
slight hill. There will be 2 trees together on your left, and then 2 <br/>
steps past that will be another tree like those, but this one has a Y <br/>
trunk. Keep going, and keep an eye out for more logs bordering the <br/>
right side of the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after the logs along the right side, you will see a trail <br/>
that branches to the right. Don't take it. 39 steps from there, on <br/>
the main trail, is a big tree on the left. Behind it, at the base, is <br/>
the Butterfly Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
When finished stamping in, return to the trail. Eventually you will <br/>
come to a place where you can see shoreline, and play in the water. <br/>
Nearby will be another sign post, similar to the one at the top of <br/>
the North Trail. Stand with the post to your back. Almost directly in <br/>
front of you is a trail heading off at 30 degrees. Take that trail. <br/>
You should pass between two small buildings (toilets).<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after those 2 small buildings, there is a right turn onto <br/>
Grotto Trail. Take that trail. It's fairly steep. You could take the <br/>
other trail, but I don't have directions from the top of it to the <br/>
final letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
At the top of the Grotto Trail, take a right. You will then be on the <br/>
Perimeter Trail. Follow that until you are passing through the <br/>
orchard, and eventually you will see a sign for the Orchard Loop.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the Orchard Loop trail a short way. There will be mossy logs <br/>
on the right, and then on the left is a mossy, multi-trunk tree. At <br/>
its base, in the ferns, is the Hummingbird Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
You can retrace your steps to the Perimeter trail, and then follow <br/>
your map back to the parking lot.<br/>
