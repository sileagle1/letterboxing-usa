Looks like Countess Aisling Mason Newton MacIntosh D'Art, nee Morey and Lady Prisspot Hydranga nee Hedge are about to start tearing off each others tiaras! Why, the Countess practically insinuated that the Prisspot China is....melmac!! Now here in Philly when we gals "throw down" well put our hair in a rubberband, kick off our flip flops and make sure our rings are facing straight out. How do you suppose the upper crust does it? Do they assign a servant to fight for them? Is it like "Upstairs-Downstairs" except it's all downstairs-downstairs and the upstairs folks are on the patio overlooking the formal gardens drinking sherry and watching the action? I've seen what Lady P did to a nosy Private Investigator who ticked her off. The dude couldn't see out of that eye for a month! The Countess better watch out! But she's from Texas (probably oil money, bet she BOUGHT<br/>
 that title) and you know what they say, don't mess with Texas! So, who will the victor be? Our bejeweled, beloved Lady P, or that up and comer from the Lone Star Star, Countess A? Stay tuned....<br/>

I said my piece, and see no reason to continue the argument. This list <br/>
should be about letterboxing! Please let the ladies scratch and claw <br/>
over the rudiments of letterboxing and the value of a handcarved <br/>

Our counterpart to mud wrestling takes place, of course, in a<br/>
porcelain tub filled with caviar... but only the very best imported<br/>
caviar, dahling!<br/>
