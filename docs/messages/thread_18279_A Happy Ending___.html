HH being lost to the world of geocaching...<br/>
<br/>
By following the cache logs and e-mailing a few folks over there I <br/>
was able to track down the lizard, and the guy who had him has <br/>
placed him in a letterbox in Eastern TN where the little guy is <br/>
visiting with a certain five-armed Echinoderm and eagerly awaiting <br/>
his next letterboxing adventure.<br/>
