                    <div class="plaintext-content">Add to that list the occasional letterboxers Mary (RI) and Dan the Safari Man, who have booked a tent site at the park.  Be advised that we may need someone to come shake us and wake us because we'll be arriving very late on Friday.  I'll send you our site number and tie a string to our toes.  We'll think of something to bring.  Most important, I think, will be cold drinks to share, maybe a few packs of iced soda.<br/>
<br/>
I may go buy a quick-set tent.  This old cabin tent from Sears is wonderfully large, but went to several outdoor concerts and such with my daughter and has all the holes to prove it.  Not only that, but the poles have to be fit together by color-code, not my favorite thing to do, especially at night.  It will be... AN ADVENTURE!  We wanted to sleep late on Sunday but we gotta be out by 12noon, as some concert is rolling in and they wouldn't let us book one more night. :::sigh:::  Hope the weather is good.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't seen much of Maine.  Went to Moosehead Lake once in early spring.  Ayuh. Saw a moose with no antlers and we dipped in river water that had been snow a week before. Moose was pretty silly looking.  I was pretty numb from the ice cold water, and nearly bit to death by black flies.  Pretty place, though.  <br/>
<br/>
Boy, I feel so outta the loop. I don't know too many of the other attendees.  Have I met any of you before...?<br/>
<br/>
Mmmmmm... Blueberries...<br/>

You know me and Kim (Rustypuff).  We plan to drive up Saturday <br/>
morning, stay a few hours, and head back.  Unfortunately, our total <br/>
away time is dictated by the bladder of the Nina-dog, who will have <br/>
to remain at home -- unless we can find someone to watch her, which <br/>

My old boy doggy is in chronic renal failure, but my daughter will be checking in on him.  Nice, though, that this time of year he can stay outside for very long periods with fresh water and shelter, and I really don't have to worry much about him. What concerns me mostly is meds, food, and fluids.  He really rather prefers outdoors.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you two can make it!<br/>
