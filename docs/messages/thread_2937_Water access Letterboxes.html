<br/>
Plant your letterboxes where you will!  In my Columbia River Slough<br/>
Series, down here in Portland, Oregon, 4 of the letterboxes are<br/>
accessible only by paddlecraft.  Another one I planted last month in<br/>
Ahjamawi State Park in North Central California can be reached by either<br/>
motor boats or paddle craft.  I think Don and Gwen have placed a box<br/>
down near Long Beach, California that can only be gotten by kayak/canoe.<br/>
Carolyn Stearns (Leader of the Pack) and her bunch placed a<br/>
water-accessible only letterbox as well, I believe on the East Coast not<br/>
too long ago.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't think it's too restrictive to place paddle-craft accessible<br/>
letterboxes.  That's my opinon.  It is biased, though, since I am a<br/>
die-hard paddler.  In fact, John and I just got back from the annual<br/>
Columbia Slough Regatta and it was a delight!  <br/>
<br/>
I will be reposting clues for letterbox #2 of the Columbia Slough series<br/>
soon, as the original spot the box was placed became too hazardous to<br/>
safely get to.  It seems to be in a good place now.  We replaced it<br/>
Wednesday evening.  <br/>
<br/>
I encourage you to place boxes of this nature in the Pacific NW so I can<br/>
go paddling in new and exciting places and do letterboxing at the same<br/>
time!!!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>
