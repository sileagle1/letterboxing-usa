with all of the recent attention the Washington DC letterboxes are <br/>
getting from the recent Washington Post article I wanted to know if <br/>
anyone out there has been there recently, within the last week.  I <br/>
have read that a person has attempted to find it and was <br/>
unsuccessful, has anyone attempted to find it recently and found it? <br/>
If so, please let me know!  Thanks<br/>
