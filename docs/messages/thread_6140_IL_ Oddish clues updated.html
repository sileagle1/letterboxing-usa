Oddish : PokeyMan # 43 <br/>
by SpaceDAW &amp; MJlikePink <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
N 38 40.760 W 089 57.980 (WGS-84)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
State: Illinois [state map]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The last location was a wet one &amp; was nearly wiped out by construction. <br/>
We moved it on 7/10/02 <br/>
The container: two small tupperware like containers (one contains the <br/>
cache..take something, leave something). <br/>
THIS IS AN EASY , KID FRIENDLY, FIND!<br/>
And there is a nice little playground.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Included, along with other goodies, is a water proof camera. Please only take <br/>
your photos with it and we will post them when the film is used up. <br/>
<br/>
At my kids request: if you see other kids in the area, please don't tell them <br/>
what you are doing. Be very very IN-CON-SPIC-U-OUS. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You will need the clues: <br/>
<br/>
Sweet Gum Tree. <br/>
<br/>
You are at the correct tree if, while standing between the tree and the <br/>
walking path, a small maple tree splits your view of the new children's <br/>
climbing wall. <br/>
<br/>
A skating rink will be located to the left of the playground.<br/>
<br/>
Find Oddish approx three feet into the brush line opposite your tree behind <br/>
the base of a small scrub tree. <br/>
<br/>
When done, recover well with branches especially in the Fall &amp; Winter. <br/>
<br/>
This is a PokeyMan letterbox...contains two hand carved stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting<br/>
<br/>
