&gt; Services like cingular offer GPS enhancements but its not that <br/>
easy, <br/>
&gt; because the responders need the GPS features to find you!<br/>
<br/>
I've been wondering about that because of The Sopranos. Seems that <br/>
Tony and all the bada-bingers steal a new cell number every day <br/>
because supposedly the Feds can track where they are when the cell <br/>
phone is on. Kinda like onstar for waste disposal execs.<br/>
<br/>
So, this mother's day weekend we were shopping on 5th Ave in the <br/>
great NYC, and as we walked by The Gap, M's cell rang. It was (gasp!) <br/>
an automated advertisement from The Gap. Too freaky!<br/>
<br/>
Now, how can I get your cell phone to ring when you're near my newest <br/>
mystery box?<br/>
