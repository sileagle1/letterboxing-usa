The signature stamps were flying up and down the table. There were also 18 stamps brought or sent for the gathering that were also flying up and down the table. I think the waiter/waitresses thought we were nuts! Oh yeah, we are :-) Hopefully those that took pictures will post them soon :-) It was great to meet some new faces and to greet the known faces. Thank-you all for a great time! The F-100, F-500 &amp; P-100 boxes will go in the mail tomorrow. <br/>
