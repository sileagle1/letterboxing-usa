                    <html><body>Planted August 16, 2002 by Geri who calls herself Chapuline (grasshopper) because she lives part of the time in Oaxaca, Mexico, where grasshoppers are a prized menu item. This Chapuline hops between her homes in Lebanon, N.H. and Oaxaca (pronounced Wah-HAH-kah) and would love to hear from you by email: geri@mexconnect.com.<br/>

Directions: Take Exit 18 from I-89 to the Lebanon Green (the rotary) and go down Campbell Street by the Esso Station to the Rail Trail entrance. There's parking and a trail map.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: This hike is 1.5 miles each way along a former railroad track turned into a popular hiking/biking trail, so the terrain is smooth and flat.  After 1/2 mile, you'll come to a street. Go straight across to your first bridge. The trail follows the river. On this hike, you'll see a dam, pond and will enjoy both shady areas and sunny spots.  About 95 steps BEFORE the fourth bridge a path on your right heads down to the river's edge. Head up the hill over the rock pile to a fire pit and a tree with a V-shaped trunk. Standing to the right of the tree with your back to the river, walk up the slope to two rotting logs and the V they form spells victory for you. Stamp in and replace carefully, taking caution not to be seen.</body></html>
