                    <div class="plaintext-content">Some boxes go missing because they are poorly hidden in the first <br/>
place.  Read the Faqs about good hiding spots.  Refer to Randy Hall's <br/>
Letterboxer's Companion, especially pages 28 - 31.  Find a few first <br/>
if possible- actually, more than a few. Another recommendation to <br/>
beginners is not to place your first few boxes in an urban setting.  <br/>
<br/>
Hiding Boxes from the LBNA FAQs<br/>
In the field, locate the specific hiding place for your box and work <br/>
backwards. Find the hiding place first because good hiding places are <br/>
difficult to find, but clues and directions can be written in pretty <br/>
much any circumstances. If you start off at the "start" and write <br/>
clues, you may end up in an area where there is no suitable place to <br/>
hide the thing. The goal is to make sure someone without the clues <br/>
has a zero chance of discovering it accidentally. It is important <br/>
that only people who understand what letterboxing is find your boxes. <br/>
<br/>
Hiding it under rocks and natural rock ledges seems to work the best, <br/>
followed by downed, hollow logs. Less ideal are makeshift piles of <br/>
sticks and bark, but that will do in a pinch, if the location is <br/>
protected from wind and storm water run-off. I recommend against <br/>
burying the thing, because you don't want people digging in parks, <br/>
many of which have artifacts buried and restrictions against digging -<br/>
- such activity will give the hobby a bad name. In Dartmoor, they use <br/>
a technique called "plugging", which the moorland terrain is suited <br/>
for. I do not recommend this in the States unless you and the people <br/>
who have your clues are familiar with the technique, and the terrain <br/>
lends itself to such. <br/>
I recommend hiding the thing in areas where there are rarely any <br/>
passerby. Boxes that are well off-trail are more likely to not be <br/>
accidently discovered, but they run the risk of having a social trail <br/>
develop to them if they have alot of visitors. Some parks require <br/>
that any boxes placed be right on the trail to prevent this, so know <br/>
the area and the rules first. Consider how many people will be in the <br/>
area of the box during high season. Make sure wildlife cannot move <br/>
the thing (but I am personally against tying it down, for fear of <br/>
wildlife getting tangled). When hiding it in grass or bushes, <br/>
consider what the vegetation will be like in the dead of winter (i.e. <br/>
gone possibly). I made the mistake of hiding my first box under a log <br/>
in thick grass in the summer, only do discover the grass completely <br/>
gone in winter, and the box visible from 50 meters away! <br/>
