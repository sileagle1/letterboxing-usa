  Here is a letter I got this morning. It's from a CINCINNATI park about <br/>
letterboxing.  They Removed my Sith Box #5 (Which is a park of 10 boxes) with <br/>
out you can not finsh the challange.<br/>
<br/>
  They say it's in a Dangerous curve.  This is a small and has no places to get <br/>
up to any kind of speed, and as long as I have been hiking in this park I have <br/>
never heard of ANYONE being hit here, ALSO it's a road that people jog on ALL <br/>
OF THE TIME!!!! so it's not like people do not travel/WALK this road.  (NOTE) <br/>
what the end of there letter says<br/>
<br/>
  ( We have a couple and we feel more than three or four could harm the fragile <br/>
ecosystems here) <br/>
<br/>
This is the same statment that the Hamilton County parks are now saying.<br/>
<br/>
 Damn, They want OUR tax money to run the park BUT HEY we can only do what THEY <br/>
say.  Sound like Big Brother to me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 "I will also go on record. I have tracked the Tri-State area for 22 years <br/>
now.  I have been doing letterboxing for about 8 months now and I have yet to <br/>
see any type of REAL damage. Most letterboxes see about 5-10 visits per<br/>
box per year (In the tri-state area) We do not HURT any parks. This is just a <br/>
Control issue and it's Sad VERY VERY sad.<br/>
<br/>
 This is your chance to say something. The Number to the park is in the letter, <br/>
Pick up your phone and give the number a call. (DO NOT BE NASTY) be nice and <br/>
let them know that as a Letterboxer/Tax Payer or better yet<br/>
<br/>
     naturalist<br/>
<br/>
 You are not happy with the park system and removing the letterboxes as <br/>
LETTERBOXES DOES NOT HURT the ecosystem. it brings people with your Young ones <br/>
out INTO it and teaches them about the ecosystem.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am a naturalist at California Woods Nature Preserve. I want to let you<br/>
&gt; &gt; know that because of the location of your geocache sith # 5 we had to<br/>
&gt; &gt; remove it.  The place it was located is the most dangerous part of our<br/>
&gt; &gt; preserve.  Many cars come around that bend and do not see anyone in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; road until it is too late.  We like the existing geocaches, but we already<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a couple and we feel more than three or four could harm the fragile<br/>
&gt; &gt; ecosystems here. The items of the cache are here at our office. We are<br/>
&gt; &gt; normally here M-F from 8-4:30. Please call us at 231-8678 if you have any<br/>
&gt; &gt; questions.<br/>
