This change will go into effect this afternoon.  Webmaster, sorry if <br/>
you've updated the page already.<br/>
<br/>
The section that reads:<br/>
<br/>
To find the box, stand next to the pillar with the number 4 on it <br/>
with <br/>
the pillar at your right hand. Look across the shade to the pillar <br/>
directly in front of you. Walk to it and turn left. Walk past 4 <br/>
pillars <br/>
and at the 5th, look up. Log in and have a great time!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Should now read:<br/>
<br/>
To find the box, stand next to the pillar with the number 4 on it <br/>
with the pillar at your right hand. Look across the shade to the <br/>
pillar directly in front of you. While facing that pillar, turn left. <br/>
Walk past 4 pillars and at the 5th, look up. Log in and have a great <br/>
time!<br/>
<br/>
I thought about it and realised that if a letterboxer is smart they <br/>
would see it from a distance.  Gotta change that.  :)<br/>

It <br/>

&gt; Backwards Bob wanted to fly a kite, so he went to the most <br/>
&gt; popular place in Virginia Beach to do so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He parked right in front of a lighthouse and walked up a flight of <br/>
&gt; steps.  "Whew, I havent done that in a while, I need to sit down."  <br/>
&gt; He found a stone bench and sat a while to catch his breath.  The <br/>
&gt; bench was in front of a large tree, planted by a woman's society.  <br/>
&gt; As he looked at the tree, he heard the sounds of laughter and <br/>
&gt; playing to his left.  He looked a saw children playing in a wooden <br/>
&gt; cove.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "That looks interesting"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He got up and walked down the mountain, heading for this cove <br/>
&gt; that isnt a true cove.  He wandered around this fun place and <br/>
&gt; noticed another playground a distance away that didn't seem as <br/>
&gt; popular.  "How sad."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He decided to swing on the neglected swings a bit discovered a <br/>
&gt; shady spot with a number 4 on it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "It's getting hot, I think I will go sit in the shade"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To find the box, stand next to the pillar with the number 4 on it <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; the pillar at your right hand.  Look across the shade to the pillar <br/>
&gt; directly in front of you.  Walk to it and turn left.  Walk past 4 <br/>
pillars <br/>
&gt; and at the 5th, look up.  Log in and have a great time!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you see the stamp you will understand the "Backwards" <br/>
&gt; Part of the title.<br/>
