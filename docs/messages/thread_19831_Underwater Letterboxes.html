IDEA: Using a plastic container -- that passes the submarine test in <br/>
the kitchen sink -- put it in a net that is held down with a weight --<br/>
 one of those round donut shapes for weightlifting.  Use one of those <br/>
quick click rings (from the hiking store or Target) so the finder <br/>
doesn't drown trying to untye the thing -- I know how focused some of <br/>
those CT boxers can get!<br/>

Hmmm.  Having just come from the Bay of Fundy, and being a coastal type, I'd advise considering tidal actions, too.  In a lake or such it'll be uniformly submerged.  Elswhere, there may be exposure twice per day or a lot more depth.  Just a thought...<br/>
