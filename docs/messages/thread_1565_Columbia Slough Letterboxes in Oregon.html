<br/>
<br/>
It's time to get excited, folks!  Six more letterboxes have been <br/>
placed in the Portland, Oregon Metropolitan Area.  This time we go to <br/>
East Multnomah County for a wet and wild time!  Please note:  The <br/>
first four letterboxes of this series can only be accessed via a <br/>
canoe or kayak.  The final two are handily located for hikers to <br/>
seek.  All can be reached from the same starting point.  Please dress <br/>
appropriately for dampness and some definite intimate contact with <br/>
blackberry brambles for boxes 1-4 and 6.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:  From the I-205,Veteran's Memorial Freeway heading North, <br/>
take exit 24B Airport Way East.  If you miss this exit, have a good <br/>
time in Washington and check out Der Mad Stamper's letterbox at <br/>
Battleground Lake!  AnywayTake the 24B, Airport Way East exit.  <br/>
Continue on that road East for three miles.  Shortly after you pass <br/>
the large pale blue water tank to your right you'll make a right turn <br/>
in the next driveway and then veer left to the Columbia Slough Canoe <br/>
Launch/Trailhead parking.  This is located at approximately NE 165th <br/>
and Airport Way.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
ON THE WATER<br/>
LETTERBOXES 1 - 4: <br/>
CLUES:  PRETTY EASY, I THINK.  <br/>
DIFFICULTY: MUST USE PADDLECRAFT TO ACCESS. ALSO, DEPENDS ON HOW WELL <br/>
YOU CAN MANEUVER YOUR CRAFT, BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO TOUGH. YOU MIGHT <br/>
HAVE A LITTLE  CONTACT WITH BERRY BRAMBLES AND BUSHES, BUT NOT MUCH.<br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA SLOUGH LETTERBOX 1:  The Simple Fish<br/>
Put your boat in at the canoe launch.  Paddle beneath the bridge and <br/>
continue.  When you reach a large, distinct fork in the waterway, <br/>
turn right.  Keep paddling.  At the next spot where cars go over and <br/>
you go under watch for a culvert on your Port side.  Pass by a <br/>
cyclone fence post, which is also Port side.  On Starboard a small <br/>
lone standing tree is on the bank.  Directly across from that on Port <br/>
side is a stump sticking sideways out of the bank.  The simple fish <br/>
in Letterbox 1 is above it there for you to stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA SLOUGH LETTERBOX 2:  The Canoe &amp; Paddle<br/>
Keep on going.  After you go under the high bridge, there is a big <br/>
rock on the Starboard side.  The canoe and paddle in Letterbox 2 is <br/>
lurking just behind on the Southwest side.<br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA SLOUGH LETTERBOX 3:  The Waterfowl<br/>
You'll paddle underneath the next low bridge.  Just before you get to <br/>
the islands, if you're lucky, nutria might swim by to check you out.  <br/>
Veer to the right of the islands on the main waterway for the rest of <br/>
your journey. Sometimes it may feel as if you're poling more than <br/>
paddling. The water can be shallow in this area, but you will get <br/>
through. If you choose to go your own way, though, you will probably <br/>
get stuck. Keep paddling past the rocky drainage and stay just to the <br/>
left of that.  You'll probably see plenty of ducks here.  You will go <br/>
under a log with pipes attached and a wire hanging down.  Lots of <br/>
nutria live around here.  You will probably have to duck or do the <br/>
canoe limbo to get beyond this, but please do it.  Once you've passed <br/>
beneath, go 15 strokes, turn your head and look aft.  Letterbox 3 <br/>
should be very obvious from this viewpoint.<br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA SLOUGH LETTERBOX 4:  The Great Blue Heron<br/>
You know, as Vanessa Williams sings, you go and save the best for <br/>
last.  Truer words could not be spoken about Letterbox 4.  This is <br/>
the last letterbox you have to access by water and, in my not so <br/>
humble opinion, it is the best.  Go all the way to the end of the <br/>
slough as far as you can paddle.  You'll be under a large concrete <br/>
pipe and water will probably be flowing from the culvert on the North <br/>
side.  Straight ahead and just above is a light green pipe.  A <br/>
concrete pipe is right behind it.  The Great Blue Heron is tucked <br/>
away in Letterbox 4 between these two pipes near the U clamp.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA RIVER SLOUGH LETTERBOX SERIES<br/>
(CONTINUED)<br/>
<br/>
ON THE TRAIL<br/>
<br/>
LETTERBOXES 5 &amp; 6: <br/>
CLUES:  VERY EASY. <br/>
DIFFICULTY: NOT MUCH.  GRAVEL &amp; MULCH PATH. A COUPLE INSTANCES WITH A <br/>
SMALL AMOUNT OF STEPS AND A BRIDGE.  DEFINITE BLACKBERRY ALERT FOR <br/>
LETTERBOX 6.<br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA SLOUGH LETTERBOX 5:  The Pine Cone<br/>
At the parking lot, follow the trail down to the canoe launch and go <br/>
under the bridge and up the stairs.  Continue on and enjoy the sights <br/>
and sounds of the slough environment (not to mention the more than <br/>
occasional airport traffic).  Keep meandering along.  Soon you will <br/>
pass by a blue water structure on your left, then a picnic area.  <br/>
There will be a green sign just past here on your right that says: <br/>
"HIKERS ONLY" From this point go down the path 33 steps.  On your <br/>
left will be several trees clumped together, two that are kind of <br/>
broken off.  One of those has a hollow-looking stump.  Behind these <br/>
trees the pine cone is nestled in the roots.<br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA SLOUGH LETTERBOX 6:  The Dragonfly<br/>
Once you're over the thrill of discovering the pine cone keep on <br/>
trucking down the trail.  Go over the bridge and keep going.  When <br/>
you see the beige building with teal and gray accents, and four pine <br/>
trees on the East side you are nearly there.  Walk forward.  Just <br/>
before the bend in the path and at the end of the cyclone fence, <br/>
please look at 8:00 O'Clock.  Do you see that wispy-looking tree <br/>
closest to you?  At the base of this the dragonfly can be found, <br/>
though not without effort. Some blackberry branches will snag you in <br/>
an effort to protect.<br/>
