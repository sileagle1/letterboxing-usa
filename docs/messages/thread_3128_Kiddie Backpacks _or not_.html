                    <div class="plaintext-content">The first time Bruce's daughter Erin was put in a backpack, we took <br/>
her to a fair (she was just under 3 y.o.). She grabbed everything she <br/>
could reach and either held on or pulled...caught me quite by <br/>
surprise the first time.  Then we decided it was better to have her <br/>
walk unless we were in a crowd--to encourage her self-confidence and <br/>
ease Dad's aching shoulders. Now she's not quite 5 and she usually <br/>
carries her own pack (a mini-backpack we got at EMS which looks just <br/>
like a grown-up pack only it's meant for camera equipment) with her <br/>
letterbox stuff &amp; snack, and generally walks 3-4 miles before needing <br/>
a ride.<br/>

&gt; I agree, the Snuglis are great.  For your older child I recommend <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; Kelty kidpack.  It's expensive but well worth the money.  You may <br/>
&gt; have a problem keeping her in it.  Some kids who haven't spent much <br/>
&gt; time in kid packs aren't thrilled when introduced at that age.  If <br/>
&gt; she doesn't take to it at least you have it for the next one.<br/>
