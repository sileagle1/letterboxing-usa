                    <div class="plaintext-content">I thought of doing a similar thing with Styrofoam. Just chunking it off<br/>
around the edges, carving a spot for the container and spraying it with the<br/>
"fake rock" paint that is available at the craft store. I just haven't had a<br/>
moment to try this though. I don't know if it would look 'real' enough to<br/>
pass for a rock out in the wild or if it would stick out like a fake rock<br/>
:-) If I get a chance to try it, I'll definitely share how it works out. I<br/>
know someone else posted (sorry don't recall your name) about a lightweight<br/>
landscaping rock that is easy to carve. I think it's called feather rock? or<br/>
something like that. I was going to try that if my Styrofoam didn't work.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to see pictures of your fake rocks when they are done.<br/>

Subject: Fake Rock Makers?<br/>
<br/>
Hi from Central Coast of CA (Region 6),<br/>
<br/>
I have had some problems finding nice safe places to put my<br/>
letterboxes so I thought why not make fake rocks?<br/>
<br/>
I got some material kind of like papermache' but with a plaster base.<br/>
2 parts dry for one part water got it kind of goopy. I then lavished<br/>
it over three film cannisters and one small tuppertype container. The<br/>
four are drying now. Their openings are on the bottoms and yes, I did<br/>
make sure the lids could come off and go back on.<br/>
<br/>
Next comes the painting. I am spray painting them first with a dark<br/>
granite spackly paint and, after that dries, a clear sealing coat.<br/>
Once they are ready, I will take pics and send them to anyone<br/>
interested. Let me know.<br/>
<br/>
I am also considering boring holes in drift-type wood but might be<br/>
disuaded if the wood might be in a place for a bonfire. We are on the<br/>
beach, afterall.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, anybody else out there making rocks for boxes? What do you<br/>
use? How well have they lasted?<br/>
<br/>

woodland creatures would like the taste of styrofoam as much as they like<br/>
plastic? Hmmm. Teeth marks might give it away, ya think? :-)<br/>

Why not use the real ones?<br/>

to intentionally use the culprit material in this way, not to mention <br/>
styrofoam can create intestinal problems for animals when eaten.<br/>
