Thank you so much for planting those boxes up by Haystack in <br/>
Wilmington/West Dover, VT!! I had only been up there in the winter <br/>
previously and never realized what a beautiful drive that was down <br/>
route 9 in the fall :) The leaves have maybe another week there to <br/>
peak, and probably 2 in western Mass where I am, but definitely a <br/>
good excuse to get out and take a drive (and maybe pick up a few <br/>
letterboxes on the way. :)). Mountain View and Freedom Series boxes <br/>
were all intact and fine. And posted this public to maybe con <br/>
someone into driving through this beautiful area if they hadnt <br/>
already planned on doing so. Loved the box at Mountain View, <br/>
creative :) Happy boxing everyone.<br/>
