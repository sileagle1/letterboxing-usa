Even though we've travelled the road through Napa numerous times, we <br/>
never realized such a pretty and historical spot existed!  It was a <br/>
nice break in our trip to northern California.  <br/>
<br/>
Note to Webmasters--The clue sheet indicated you needed to know who <br/>
owns the letterbox.  The record book indicates it was placed by Chris <br/>
from Iowa.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be spending some time here in the north and hope to get busy <br/>
doing some carvng, stamping and placing!  We're new to the sport and so <br/>
far have found nine and placed one while visiting in Indiana.  Carving <br/>
that first stamp was interestang!<br/>
