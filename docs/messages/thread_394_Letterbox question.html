<br/>
Tammy, I believe I used a whole page when I stamped Tom Cheney's<br/>
Rock Creek letterbox in Oregon last year.  I believe I also printed<br/>
my name, my hometown and the date.  I think its OK if you want to<br/>
leave a little bio but you certainly would not want to take up<br/>
a whole lot of space in the logbook that might otherwise be used<br/>
for stamp images, esp. if it is a small book.  My Split Rock<br/>
logbook at Minnesota's north shore has lots of paper in it, so<br/>
it would not bother me if people use a whole sheet or even two<br/>
front and back.  Let common sense dictate.  If the letterbox is<br/>
remote and only gets visited once every 3 years or so and it has<br/>
ample paper in it I would say write a little journal in it if you<br/>
feel like it.  Otherwise use paper more sparingly and just put<br/>
your stamp, name, date, etc. in it.  Hope this answers your<br/>
question.<br/>

wondering if it was ...hmm.... proper "etiquette" to also write<br/>
your name as well as stamping the stamp.  Or if the log book<br/>
was to have stamps only.  <br/>
<br/>
There I go trying to make rules again.<br/>
<br/>
Then it seems it would be OK to stamp my stamp and at least write <br/>
my name, maybe the date and a few other words.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I have my first letterbox ready to go - just have to travel<br/>
to my destination and hide it and write the clues.<br/>

<br/>
If an ol' Wizard may respond..do let me give my 2c worth...<br/>
<br/>
The rule, imho, is ; " There are no rules  "<br/>
<br/>
Some folk write a short message about the day, date, weather and how they<br/>
found the place..(date is really minimum imho)<br/>
<br/>
Certainly why not say who you are...or rather your 'boxing name"..eg<br/>
Have-feet-will-travel, or The Moorland Wizard..<br/>
<br/>
Some folk write a little poem..quite common actually....a response about<br/>
the image found is very common...be yourself..be spontaneous..er ..I<br/>
believe the expression in the USA is "Enjoy"....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do you use one whole sheet per stamp?  Or do several people<br/>
&gt;stamp on the same page?  Assuming it is a small book like 3.5 x 5.<br/>
<br/>
Many on a page or few..depends on the size of your stamp, the<br/>
log-book..what message you feel like leaving..etc etc..<br/>
<br/>
Remember ..sometime later YOU will be readin a book "full" of personal<br/>
stamps and messages..what would you like to have read from your soul-mate<br/>
letterboxers ?....maybe that's the answer to all the questions<br/>
really...The messages and stamps are for the next finder to read..so make<br/>
em something that delivers a nice message to your colleagues in<br/>
boxing...(does that sound OK ?)<br/>
<br/>
It's a letterbox..leave a short letter if you wish...relax and be yourself<br/>
;  Seems fine to me...<br/>
<br/>
Most of all enjoy it !<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing<br/>

Hi Tammy,<br/>
<br/>
I like to sign &amp; date my entries.  My personal stamp has changed a few<br/>
times &amp; still doesn't contain even one carved letter.  Besides name &amp;<br/>
date, I usually jot a comment or two, about the stamp, the location, any<br/>
difficulty in finding, or just a hello.  It is a little bit of a<br/>
momentous occasion &amp; I choose to celebrate it with at least a line or<br/>
two.<br/>

my own boxes have one or more stamps per page and it is preferable to<br/>
only use the facing page so that the stamps or messages remain clean<br/>
from images on the reverse side (did you follow that?).  As for what to<br/>
write, anything goes.  I've seen real names, initials, just comments or<br/>
just personal stamps, I don't think it really matters as long as you do<br/>
the same each time.  It's always nice to see the date, though; it's<br/>
always nice to find a box no one has visited for a while.<br/>
