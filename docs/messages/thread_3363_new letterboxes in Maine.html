<div><b>Subject:</b> [LbNA-WM] new letterboxes in 
  Maine</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Well here I go again.  I've been having 
  internet problems, I don't know exactly what to do, but I hope this is right 
  and gets posted on your website.  My family and I planted three 
  letterboxes a month ago in Maine, and there they sit while I get frustrated 
  over technology. Oh well.....this will be the third time I've typed up these 
  directions, and God willing, you'll receive them!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My family vacations every summer in Aroostock 
  County, Maine and we were bummed to discover that letterboxes are scarce in 
  Maine, let alone Aroostock County.  So we planted three letterboxes with 
  the hope that the locals might pick up on this and plant some for us to find 
  next summer. So here they are.....</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>*****************************************************************************************</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>ECHO LAKE LETTERBOX</strong>, 
  Presqu'isle, ME.  Aroostock County</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Follow Rt. 1 South from center of Presqu'isle 
  to Aroostock State Park.  Follow signs.  Stop at the entry gate and 
  pay the park ranger a minimal entry fee and be sure to pick up a brochure and 
  map of the park.  This is a lovely park where for a mere dollar or two, 
  you can enjoy a picnic area, swimming area (with lifeguard in season), and 
  great hiking trails.  There also is a campground and X-country trails for 
  winter activities.  Bring a picnic lunch and enjoy some time in this 
  great park.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>To get to what you're looking for, park in the 
  parking lot by the swimming area, and head SW onto the Quaquahog Nature 
  Trail.  Take time to find out what "Quaquajo" means.  At fork, head 
  to North Peak, 1 mile.  Be careful not to follow X-country ski 
  trail.  Follow the blue blaze up and up.  This is a wonderful steep 
  trail.  Can you just imagine what this would be like in the winter?  
  You would need ice picks attached to your shoes!!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>At the T, head North (duh) up the trail to the 
  North peak.  When you almost at the end, look for an overlook opening on 
  the left.  Immediately after this opening, take a small path off to the 
  right, 120'.  Go 15 paces SE.  On the left, spot a small grove of 
  lovely white birch.  Find what you seek hidden in the rocks to the 
  left.  Please stamp up and rehide carefully.  Enjoy the view of 
  Presqu'isle from the North peak and rest a moment.  Go ahead and shout 
  from the top and maybe you'll hear your echo.  The day we were here, 
  there was a whole family of kids shouting.  It was funny actually because 
  we could hear them all the way up the trail.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Head back down the way you came, or head 
  towards the South peak.  Follow the sign.  There is a trail that 
  heads down the mountain from the South Peak that will lead you to the camping 
  area, which connects to the parking lot and your car. We hope you enjoy your 
  visit at Aroostock State Park as much as we did. </div>

<div> </div>
<div><strong>Haystack Mountain 
  Letterbox</strong>,  Castle Hill, ME, (between Ashland and Mapleton, ME) 
  Aroostock County</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Follow Rt. 163 West from Presqu'isle for 
  approximately 15 miles.  Haystack Mountain is on the right.  Or 
  follow Rt. 163 East from Ashland for approximately 9 miles.  Haystack 
  Mountain is on the left, just past the Haystack Mountain rest area.  Turn 
  up drive and park at base of mountain.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Take a NW trail up.  At a medium sized 
  boulder in the middle of the path, take a left at 270'.  This is the 
  easier way up, a blue blazed trail.  Continue in a northerly direction 
  picking your way up the rocks.  Take care here with children and 
  pets.  This is kinda tricky.  Carefully find your way to the top of 
  the mountain.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At the highest point, notice the tallest lone 
  pine.  Facing South at the pine tree, walk 6 paces at 200' to Maine DOT 
  survey control marker.  Walk 18 paces down at 90'.  In an old set of 
  lichen and moss covered roots, you will find what you seek.  Please 
  rehide carefully and cover up when done stamping in. (If you think you may be 
  one of the first to find this letterbox, could you please take a ziplock bag 
  with you to put our pad and stamp in.  This was the first letterbox we've 
  ever planted and we forgot the plastic bag.  I can't imagine what an 
  Aroostock winter might do to an underprotected letterbox!! Many thanks to 
  you!!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Enjoy the view from the top.  There are 
  potato and grain fields to see in the summer, like checkerboards intermingled 
  with forests.  I can imagine the fall foliage views are worth the short, 
  but steep hike too.  Every year we hike this mountain (elevation 
  1,341')  and we love it.  It's short and sweet!!</div>
<div> </div>

  letterbox, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:pineknoll@snet.net">pineknoll@snet.net</a>.</div>

<div><strong>Portage Lake Letterbox</strong>, 
  Portage, ME. Aroostock County</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Take Rt.11 North from Ashland to Portage, ME.  At 
  center of town by hotel and general store, turn left over the railroad 
  tracks.</div>
<div>Stay to  the left and the Portage Town Beach will be on 
  your right.  Pull in and park.  This is a wonderful little town 
  beach open to the public.  It offers a beach area, covered picnic area 
  with grills, perennial flower gardens, an occasional duck or goose, and a 
  playscape for the little ones. The logging trucks that rumble by provide 
  entertainment, especially for big and little boys.  My son loves 
  them.   Take a swim, grill some burgers, and relax.  You also 
  might want to do some letterboxing.  While you're discovering all that 
  there is at this little beach, look for the pair of populars.  Go in and 
  over, then left and look under.  Find the box and stamp up 
  secretly.  Please rehide carefully.  And continue to enjoy your day 
  at Portage Lake. If you stay late enough, you may get to see a wonderful view 
  of the lake at sunset.  It's worth waiting for.  And you could 
  always get dinner at the hotel.  They have good home-cooked food.  
  Our family just loves Portage and we know you will too!</div>
