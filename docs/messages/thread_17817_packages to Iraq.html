Iraq.  Some of the packages we sent her got there in a week, others <br/>
took much longer to reach her.  She never received my Christmas <br/>
package to her before returning to the US so hopefully it will catch <br/>
up with her eventually.  So I recommend emailing him directly and <br/>
asking him about your packages otherwise he might not know they're <br/>
coming or came.  <br/>
