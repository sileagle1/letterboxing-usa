                    <div class="plaintext-content">Currently, as of 9:30 am this morning, Sunday Nov 16th, 2003 there are 32<br/>
registered participants in the Aztec Gold Postal Letterbox.  The response<br/>
has been overwhelming and I wish to thank each and everyone of you, both<br/>
publicly and privately, for requesting this box. I only hope that the stamp<br/>
is as good as you are hoping it to be.<br/>
<br/>
This box will consist of the stamp and a URL to a private online website<br/>
that will contain the clues to my first Virtual Letterboxes. Again, since<br/>
this is really meant for those that can not make it to Washington to get<br/>
these stamps themselves, I am making the images of the rest of the stamps in<br/>
the series as virtual letterboxes for those that wish to<br/>
view/capture/grab/whatever those boxes as well.<br/>
<br/>
You may ask what will make the real stamps any better than this? Let me<br/>
explain the concept here.  First off, the Aztec Gold stamp is broken into 5<br/>
pieces and each part is hidden individually.  That in and of itself is a<br/>
kewl prize, if you will, in my mind, but, since I am a very enthusiastic<br/>
letterboxer, I added more.  There are also six pirate flags hidden as well.<br/>
Some of these are hidden using treasure maps, parts of which are missing and<br/>
the missing parts must be found in order to complete the clues for the<br/>
flags.  Once someone has found the flags and has completed the Aztec Gold<br/>
piece and shows me those images, we have a copy of the famed 'Black Pearl of<br/>
Manila' necklace, reputedly made for Queen Isabella of Spain but never<br/>
delivered due to a Pirate raid (Imagine that!), for each and every one that<br/>
completes the series.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, please let me know privately, don't want to clog the lists<br/>
with replies here, what you think of this idea of the 'prize' for those that<br/>
complete the entire series.  Please reply to this address:<br/>
XrayvenhausX@XmyndworxX.XcomX (remove the X's) and not by clicking on the<br/>
reply button, otherwise it will go to the mailing list.<br/>

Thank you Laurette for your kind words... Rayvenmom and I spent many hours<br/>
making that one and then sent it out, fearing that it would not be up to par<br/>
with the other PLB's that have gone before us.  based on this response, we<br/>
are planning another one, we'll announce it here when we're ready to take<br/>
names on it, plus, I have the Letterbox that I used to propose to Rayvenmom,<br/>
a few have mentioned wanting to get a look at it as well, so, we'll announce<br/>
that one when it is ready too.<br/>
