never seen, despite being an OC resident for the last 35 years.  I had<br/>
no idea there was open land anywhere in OC.<br/>
<br/>
We trudged through a bit of mud, due to the recent rains, and then<br/>
mistakenly followed the chain link fence a bit too long, going to the<br/>
right of the BMX hills.  Upon finding nothing, we doubled back, found<br/>
the trash can on the left, ddged a few bikers (literally) and<br/>
13-year-old Kate found the 5-trunks and the box.  Although I must say<br/>
that those were 8 very LONG paces from where we entered the thicket.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, we were both thrilled and stamped in.  Thanks for a<br/>
challenging hunt and a pleasant walk!  We'll send a postcard.<br/>
