                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great job, Nisa! Can't wait to get back up your way. Tom is going to<br/>
need some back up as webmaster of the Dartmoor of North America. And<br/>
don't pooh-pooh your numbers: I know from experience that your boxes,<br/>
while few, are exceptionally high quality!<br/>
<br/>
And along those lines, we've (more or less) completed our Conanicut<br/>
Island Series, with 4 boxes on Jamestown in Rhode Island. All have<br/>
beautiful views of Narragansset Bay and several scenic lighthouses, and<br/>
all are quite easy both for clues and for hikes. One of the boxes may<br/>
disturb, due to it's position on "nonpublic" land, which is sort of a<br/>
letterbox rule breaker....but the site is just too breathtaking to<br/>
leave out of the series. We may plant 2 more in this series this<br/>
winter, but it's good to go as is.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of other new boxes with views of the spots on<br/>
Jamestown as well, all on the "clues" map at letterboxing.org and at<br/>
our homepage,<br/>
