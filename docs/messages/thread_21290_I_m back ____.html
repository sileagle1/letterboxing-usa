Well heres a big 2005 hello to all my friends in the group.<br/>
"Where have you been?" I hear you all cry, well, sit back and i shall <br/>
explain all.<br/>

In the month of December 2004, sadly, my dear and trusted computer <br/>
went terminally pear shaped!  Dont ask me why or how, alls i know is <br/>
that it was a metal box full of thingys which went poof !<br/>
<br/>
I have now taken delivery of a new shiny metal box of thingy's which <br/>
seems to be working well.<br/>
<br/>
As you can imagine i have a lot of catching up to do and will be <br/>
making a start this week.  I have lots to tell as I have now started <br/>
University too.<br/>
