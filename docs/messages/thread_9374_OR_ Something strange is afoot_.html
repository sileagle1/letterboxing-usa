                    <div class="plaintext-content">It has come to my attention that strange items have been left in <br/>
certain letterboxes in the Portland area. Further items may possibly <br/>
be left in more boxes in the near future. I am currently in <br/>
possession of one such item. I do not know the significance, if any, <br/>
of these objects. I presume that the objects may contain information <br/>
of interest to the letterboxing community but that is speculation on <br/>
my part and if true I have not yet had the wits to decipher any such <br/>
information. I believe the items to be identical, but am not <br/>
certain. I am instructed to inform finders of the objects that, <br/>
after studying the object, it should be given to another letterboxer <br/>
or placed into a letterbox. I am further instructed to pass on the <br/>
following:<br/>
<br/>
Stumped, are you Willard? Perhaps you should visit Jack. He is <br/>
lonely having only had a few visitors since I last saw him quite a <br/>
while ago. He is apparently tired of fast food, asking me,<br/>
"What's for Dinner?" It may be wise to head to the<br/>
metallic mountain via the path of seven, but be careful; the count <br/>
may be off as the fallen alder leaves have obscured the way.<br/>
<br/>
Please make no attempt to elicit further information from me. I am <br/>
not at liberty to disclose the little additional information about <br/>
the item I possess. I will not return email.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too have had a similar dream. But in my dream I also saw an <br/>
elusive, daring odd hen in the distance. As I ran by, twice, where I <br/>
thought the hen was, I found neither the hen nor her platter. After <br/>
awaking I visited a friend, a ready source of wisdom, always <br/>
reliable, A number one. She said, "Seek high and low for what you <br/>
desire, but be careful in determining which bit of information is <br/>
true and which is false." I went to an area I thought may be of help, <br/>
but found that the two bits, one large and one small, had already <br/>
taken the information. I had the strange feeling that this was eerily <br/>
appropriate. Perhaps they are even related to the quintuplets. <br/>
Conquered, I felt in my soul the need to retire to a place of <br/>
refreshment. Arriving there I was flattered to be asked, "Are you <br/>
21?" Perhaps I shall try again, off and on, in the future until I <br/>
find what I seek.<br/>
