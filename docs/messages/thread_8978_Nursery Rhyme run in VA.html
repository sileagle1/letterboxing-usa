What a great day (and it's just noon!).  First wonderful teacher conferences <br/>
and then a fun jaunt to an adorable park we never knew was there!  This is <br/>
one of my favorite things about letterboxing -- fun outdoors for the family <br/>
discovering all these great treasures!<br/>
<br/>
The kids had a great time with the nursery rhymes and I'm glad they were <br/>
there to look under the little places they sometimes need to look!  They <br/>
bend a lot more easily than the older members of BeMa do and their a lot <br/>
more discrete.<br/>
<br/>
We had to keep good track of our little ones because it must have been <br/>
fieldtrip day for all the local elementary schools!  Kids everywhere!!  No <br/>
dogs, sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you all would have been there to see the "spectacular" show the <br/>
littlest BeMa put on in the Gazebo (Brittany Spears watch out!)<br/>
<br/>
We didn't find Peter Peter until the very end because that back exit was <br/>
mobbed with field trippers and we couldn't go out that way.  I'm glad we <br/>
found it though because it is an adorable spot!<br/>
<br/>
We will definitely go back when the weather is a little nicer.  I'm sure it <br/>
is beautiful with all the flowers in bloom!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for leading us to this wonderful place!<br/>

Yay!  We're glad you liked it.  It's a great field trip with small ones, at any season but definitely in the spring and summer.  If you're into indigenous landscaping they have a great VA native plants trail.  In the spring and summer the air over the shade garden is full of zipping hummingbirds, like little missles flashing around.  </body></html>

If you don't mind, and any others who find the Greenspring Gardens Mother Goose Box in Annandale VA, I would like to put your email into a thank-you book for the park staff, along with an intro to letterboxing, to show them what fun this was for park visitors, and how it brought people to their park.  <br/>
