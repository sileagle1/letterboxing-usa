soon and attempt to find the letterboxes.  By the time I understood <br/>
the trails well enough to decipher the clues, fingers and toes were <br/>
getting numb.<br/>
<br/>
My question is about part of the trail that took us through two rows <br/>
of very tall pine trees.  It was just amazing.  All of our mouths <br/>
dropped open when we saw them.  I've searched the net and Rock Spring <br/>
literature for information about them but can't find anything.  Can <br/>
anyone share anything about them with me?  <br/>

a half tall.  They were bare on the bottom 3/4, the tops had greens.  I just<br/>
sent some film off to Mystic, maybe I'll be able to upload a photo to yahoo<br/>
next week so you can see. :)<br/>

&gt; Haven't been to the site myself but my guess is that what you saw may<br/>
&gt; have either been some sort of controlled forest planting (or tree<br/>
&gt; farming)  many years ago.... or perhaps the lining of an old<br/>
&gt; cartway?  Thats typically the only way you will see straight<br/>
&gt; plantings in Conn. How old were the trees? Or more like...how big<br/>
&gt; were they?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi.  I uploaded that photo of the tree pathway I was asking questions about.  Of course the photo doesn't do it justice.  The picture is a bit dark.  You can see my "family" hugging the trees.  I hope to get a box planted in the general area soon.  Maybe entice a few people to see it for themselves.<br/>
