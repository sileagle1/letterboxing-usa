of the Ruffner Mountain Nature Center. I understand why many<br/>
letterboxers don't want to verify permission before planting, but<br/>
sometimes this leads to land managers becoming hostile to letterboxing<br/>
and even removing them.<br/>

Orignal Message:<br/>
Recently, I found out that well-intentioned people are placing<br/>
letterboxes wherever they like, without even advising the owner that<br/>
they had done so, much less obtaining prior permission.<br/>
<br/>
As land steward for a privately owned publicly accessible nature<br/>
center, I find this unacceptable, just as I did for other activities.<br/>
<br/>
We must be appraised of any intentions to place letterboxes, and their<br/>
proposed locations, to determine acceptability. I have contacted, via<br/>
the website, a couple of placers and asked them to remove their<br/>
letterbox from our property &amp; the corresponding hints from the website.<br/>
<br/>
While I absolutely approve of the motivation &amp; intentions, I totally<br/>
disapprove of the approach of placement without first obtaining<br/>
permission. If indeed the activity is to have any "legitimacy", I urge<br/>
you to consider getting the letterboxing community to adopt a<br/>
different approach.<br/>
