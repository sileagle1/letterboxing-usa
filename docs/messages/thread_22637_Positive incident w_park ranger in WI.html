Hello<br/>
<br/>
I am a park ranger, I was patrolling Naga-Waukee Park<br/>
looking for evidence of cougars when instead I found<br/>
your box on the ground. I assume it was supposed to be<br/>
in the large fallen tree that it was under, so I put<br/>
it back there. First I took it back to the ranger<br/>
station to check it out and read the literature. I<br/>
don?t have a home made stamp so I used my ranger logo<br/>
stamp instead.<br/>
<br/>
You have a neat hobby. It seems to be harmless as long<br/>
as everyone follows the rules in the instruction<br/>
sheet. After dealing with drunks, litterbugs, and<br/>
vandals it is nice to see some positive recreation<br/>
going on in the parks.<br/>
<br/>
What sort of maintenance is done on these boxes? Does<br/>
the owner check on them periodically? Do they pick<br/>
them up after they get old? If they just get left<br/>
behind I could see that being an issue with a park<br/>
manager.<br/>
<br/>
Has this ?letterboxing? really been going on since<br/>
1854? What sort of waterproof box did they use back<br/>
then? I don?t think they had Tupperware!<br/>
<br/>

Enjoy your county parks!<br/>

If what we've read about the history of letterboxing is correct, wasn't <br/>
the original letterbox a calling card in a bottle with a cork on it?  <br/>
That would suffice to keep not only the liquid in but also the moisture <br/>
out.  At least the myriad billion dollar grossing and centuries old <br/>
wine industry has 'banked' on that fact for ages.  ;)<br/>

I've been re-reading my Dartmoor books and web sites to prepare for <br/>
our trip there next month, and I've seen the original container at <br/>
Cranmere pool variously described as a "stone jar" and a "jam jar," <br/>
among others. I interpreted the "stone jar" reference as "stoneware," <br/>
a kind of pottery -- I have a couple of antique pieces of this kind <br/>
of container used for foodstuffs during that same period, so that <br/>
seems to make the most sense to me. It probably was corked.<br/>

In CT we have a letterbox placed by the forest rangers in each of our state<br/>
parks.  Once you have found five you email them and they'll go out to<br/>
confirm and then send you a patch.  If you find all 30 you will get a<br/>
walking stick.<br/>

  Hello<br/>

  I am a park ranger, I was patrolling Naga-Waukee Park<br/>
  looking for evidence of cougars when instead I found<br/>
  your box on the ground. I assume it was supposed to be<br/>

  You have a neat hobby. It seems to be harmless as long<br/>
  as everyone follows the rules in the instruction<br/>
  sheet. After dealing with drunks, litterbugs, and<br/>
  vandals it is nice to see some positive recreation<br/>
  going on in the parks.<br/>
<br/>
  What sort of maintenance is done on these boxes? Does<br/>
  the owner check on them periodically? Do they pick<br/>
  them up after they get old? If they just get left<br/>
  behind I could see that being an issue with a park<br/>

<br/>
  Has this ?letterboxing? really been going on since<br/>
  1854? What sort of waterproof box did they use back<br/>
