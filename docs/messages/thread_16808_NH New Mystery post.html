somewhere in New Hampshire. The box is a memorial to a fascinating, <br/>
colorful character who lived part of her life where the box is <br/>
hidden. The box is called "The Extravagant Mme. S."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The webmasters are currently working on the New Hampshire pages to <br/>
make them ever more user-friendly (Thanks!!). I am going to risk a <br/>
faux-pax by posting the clues to this box here on the Talk List <br/>
because the NH Mysteries are hard to find on the website right now.<br/>
<br/>
The Extravagant Mme. S.<br/>
<br/>
NH Mystery<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hiking: about a mile round trip; hilly.<br/>
Clues: moderate<br/>
Note: Not recommended when there is snow on the ground, because the <br/>
trail would probably be impossible to follow in such conditions. Keep <br/>
track of where you have been in order to avoid getting lost, even <br/>
without snow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Heads turned, eyebrows lifted, and jaws set more firmly when the <br/>
French widow of the Italian immigrant arrived in the small New <br/>
Hampshire town in the 1920s. Who was this woman? Why did she dress so <br/>
flamboyantly? What was she doing on her trips to the big town across <br/>
the river in her fancy chauffeured car? How had she become so rich? <br/>
Why had she changed her name? What made her decide to move from Paris <br/>
to New York, and then to New Hampshire, of all places? Who were all <br/>
the glamorous young ladies and gentlemen who drove up from New York <br/>
to stay at Madame's castle in her forest? What kind of unimaginable <br/>
debauchery went on up there anyway? These are some of the mysteries <br/>
that persist, even to this day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Find your way to the ruins of Madame's castle, which burned in 1962, <br/>
in the forest that still bears her name. If you feel compelled to <br/>
climb the tallest remaining structure, be very careful to avoid <br/>
personal injury. You may find yourself singing strains of the famous <br/>
8-minute long Led Zeppelin song. From the highest point, or much more <br/>
safely from the zone of warmth in the middle of the castle's ground <br/>
floor, sight a large tree at 260 degrees. Take the trail to the left <br/>
of this tree and follow it uphill. The trail isn't blazed, so pay <br/>
attention. After a streambed crossing followed by several downed <br/>
trees across the trail, look for a bend to the right where the trail <br/>
becomes much smaller and less distinct. A little further along, you <br/>
will come to a walled square structure which might have been a <br/>
cistern or well. 200 more steps will bring you to a T in the small <br/>
trail. Go left to scale a close-by hill with a thick-trunked pine <br/>
tree on top and a nice view to the northeast. From the pine tree, <br/>
sight 194 degrees to a black birch (dark colored bark with upside-<br/>
down Vs). The letterbox is at its base.<br/>
<br/>
Planted by Curious Crane and Latte Man in memory of Mme. S., who died <br/>
in 1965 at the age of 87.<br/>
