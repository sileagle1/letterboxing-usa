Eric at EMS.   I told him about the box and that the log was intact <br/>
and he's going to make an effort to replace the stamp sometime soon. <br/>
Dunno when that may be, but soon.  Also suggested he move the box a <br/>
little bit and make it a less suspicious hiding spot.   Apparently <br/>
the box got vandalized last August too and was replaced then.  Thats <br/>
disheartening though!<br/>
<br/>
Also, last time I was in EMS in Waterford, the clues book had NO <br/>
copies of pretty much ANY clues.   I brought it to their attention <br/>
and have not been back yet to check and see if it has been taken <br/>
care of.  If you have boxes that are in the EMS clue binder, you may <br/>
want to pop in sometime soon and just check up on them and make sure <br/>
there's copies.   Also, I am looking for copies of United We Stand <br/>
and Ground Zero.... both missing from EMS logs....<br/>
