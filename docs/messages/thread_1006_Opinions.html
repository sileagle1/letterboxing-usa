I, for one, am really glad you stepped up and offered your opinion.  I would encourage all (127 at last count) who subscribe to this list, to speak up more often.  It's that exchange that allows our little community and hobby to grow and evolve.<br/>
<br/>
As to your opinion, I agree.  While I have no objection to rest stop boxes (although I'm afraid they'll get trashed rather quickly), I prefer boxes that take me and the boys out in nature, a historic park (Valley Forge), or a beautiful town (Mystic, CT) for a while.  Then, in addition to the joy of findign the box, there's been a whole experience built around the process of finding it.  At some level, the letterbox has become an excuse/motivation to go out and discover a new area.<br/>
<br/>
I also have to agree with Randy and would like to see more "challenging" boxes/clues.  There are some clues out there that I've been working on for over a year now, and that's a lot of fun.  Can you imagine my joy, when I actually find one of these!!!!  They don't have to be super difficult either.  sometimes just a ltitle twist to the clues is all that';s neede to make a real neat clue.  A further motivation for more challenging clues, is the decreased likelihood that the box will get thrashed.<br/>

Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
it's been awhile, but colin and i have been plugging away at the<br/>
letterboxes posted around connecticut and rhode island.  slowly but<br/>
surely!!  have not found one yet that is not a drew clan letterbox!! boy<br/>
are you guys active.   <br/>
<br/>
i do want to put my two cents in about the rest stop letterboxes.  part of<br/>
this "game" is the walkabout in the woods, and the communing with nature.<br/>
i relish the times that colin, the dog and i can take a quiet few hours and<br/>
tromp along.  we really use the time to explore the natural environment and<br/>
to discuss issues that are on my eight year olds mind.  to be able to walk<br/>
in the woods, get closer to each other and then find a treasure at the end<br/>
of the path is what attracted us to letterboxing in the first place.  i<br/>
think the hustle and bustle of rest stops does not lend itself to the<br/>
"game", plus it seems to be just to "get a stamp", not the actual hunt of<br/>
it.  also, i really like the idea of people stumbling into  letterboxing,<br/>
like it seems most of us have, through reading, or word of mouth.  i know<br/>
this sounds elitist - i don't mean it to (please everyone, don't take me to<br/>
task for it!) - but it's a delicious secret!!  <br/>
<br/>
anyway, that's how i feel. i know i haven't been doing it as long as some<br/>
others, so maybe i shouldn't offer an opinion.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you are referring to my post, you took it the wrong way.<br/>
<br/>
In my 5 years of letterboxing, I've written that opinion many times<br/>
and in many forms.  I admitted at the top that it was unpopular, but<br/>
never once has it generated such a response.  (in fact, nothing I <br/>
have _ever_ wrote has elicited a response such that I may have to<br/>
worry about who I meet on the trails or at gatherings).  Quite frankly, <br/>
I feel that that was my most lucid attempt at that opinion, and had <br/>
no intent to inflame anyone.  Moreover, as I stated at the top, I <br/>
was responding more to the general idea than your specific idea anyway, <br/>
and moreover at the bottom, I wrote "and I'm not trying to say "bad <br/>
idea" -- just present some words from a different point of view about <br/>
where I derive fun in this game".<br/>
<br/>
It seems clear that the "fermentation/distillation" metaphor generated<br/>
confusion.  Unfortunately, I'm aware of no better way to explain it.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

Are you sure it wasn't the bit saying "in such a way that _he_ would be able<br/>
to find the box" (with "he" even underscored)?<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I found your post fascinating - I hadn't thought about<br/>
boxing from that viewpoint.<br/>
<br/>
As for the original topic of discussion - I like the idea of having contact<br/>
details with the clues so I can let the owner know about the status of the<br/>
box. But I'm also wary of having a system where anyone can flag a box as<br/>
"missing" unless the flag is set by the box owner.  We have found a number<br/>
of "missing" boxes, but, ironically maybe, I'm less inclined to go hunting<br/>
for a box if I think it might not be there. Go figure. <br/>

Of course, no hard feelings.  E-mail is tough.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Are you sure it wasn't the bit saying "in such a way that _he_ would be able<br/>
&gt; to find the box" (with "he" even underscored)?<br/>
<br/>
"He" refers to the generic hider earlier in the point, and is emphasised <br/>
because it would seem odd to care how the hider would find the box, but <br/>
that is the idea of treasure maps (sorry if that was the source of trouble):<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hider interacts with place<br/>
&gt; and creates textual representation of place and location of box (what I<br/>
&gt; call "the map"), in such a way that _he_ would be able to find the box<br/>
&gt; (pirates didn't write treasure maps for others to find -- the idea was to<br/>
&gt; jog _their_ memory, but be _obscure_ to others (we, of course, take some<br/>
&gt; liberties to make the game playable).<br/>
<br/>
