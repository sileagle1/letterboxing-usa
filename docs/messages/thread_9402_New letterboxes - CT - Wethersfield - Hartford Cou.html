Difficulty - not too hard<br/>
Time - 40 minutes including stamping in<br/>
Directions to starting place - Find a map with route 175 on it.  <br/>
Between routes 15 and 99 is the section of 175 (aka Wells road) in <br/>
which you are interested.  Turn north on Folly Brook.  Wintergreen <br/>
woods is quite near Wethersfield high School.  You can park in the <br/>
gravel area.  <br/>
<br/>
Details you should know - Christi, Jeff and Liam's George Washington, <br/>
Buttolph-Williams House, and Red Onion Letterboxes are also in this <br/>
town and they are terrific. <br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Adam' Rib Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Head from your object of conveyance to the blue trail.  The green<br/>
gate is the wrong way.  You will want to turn right on the blue trail <br/>
when the opportunity presents itself.  Enjoy this gentle stroll in<br/>
the woods.  In a few minutes you will come to a bridge, the first of<br/>
many.  Under the eastern end of this bridge lies Adam's Rib.  Well, <br/>
not the actual rib, but the letterbox is there.  <br/>
<br/>
The Good Investment Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
I imagine this place could be quite buggy in warmer months.  Lots of <br/>
standing water.  Keep going along the blue trail until you cross the <br/>
curved bridge.  The trail begins to turn back after this.  In a very <br/>
few minutes the trail will come to a lovely pond.  Look, enjoy, turn <br/>
around and head back the way you came for a minute.  On your right<br/>
you will see what looks to be the old blue dot trail (as compared with<br/>
the blue rectangle trail you are currently walking).  It's a fairly <br/>
obvious place to turn.  Walk 30 steps at 120 degrees.  At 75 degrees <br/>
you will see four trees fairly close together with a lot of woods <br/>
debris on the ground in between.  One of the trees has a small tree<br/>
of a different kind growing quite close to it. Underneath some of the <br/>
debris you will learn what I think is a good investment in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and enjoy this pleasant spot in the midst of suburbia.<br/>

I found your Good Investment letterbox, and I was the first one.  <br/>
This is my first first :-).<br/>
<br/>
I looked for Adam's Rib, but I did not want to disturb the 4 to 5 <br/>
inches of snow.  That could lead to unwanted attention to the <br/>
location by those who may disrespect our efforts. I will come back <br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
n.b. The old blue dot mark may not be renewed in the future. It will <br/>
fade out or the bark of the tree may fall off, leaving searchers <br/>
without a reference point.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a nice stamp.<br/>
