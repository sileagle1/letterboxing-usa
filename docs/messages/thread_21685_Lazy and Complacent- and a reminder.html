Reminder first, as I am absolutely sure some will not<br/>
want to hear what I have to say afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
REMINDER: It is considered proper and good netiquette<br/>
to cut and paste ONLY the portion of any email you are<br/>

Guilty as charged, but more for a lack of netiquette knowledge, <br/>
thanks for the lesson!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm glad I have taken my children with me to search<br/>
&gt; for some elusive boxes-sometimes making up to 4 trips,<br/>
&gt; gasp! <br/>
<br/>
Kudos, I agree. I go boxing with my son and he likes the more <br/>
difficult boxes. We have spent hours rooting around in the woods <br/>
looking for those mysterious treasures and trying to solve the <br/>
puzzles, sometimes coming up empty-handed. It never daunts him, it <br/>
just makes him more determined to solve the mystery. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She also says that was the most memorable time she has<br/>
&gt; had in her life.  Why?  "'Cause we got to spend time<br/>
&gt; together" she said.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Priceless.<br/>
<br/>
Not only is time spend with your child priceless, the look on their <br/>
faces, and their sense of accomplishment is something you don't soon <br/>
forget!!<br/>

<br/>
That just happened to me and I have absolutely no idea why.<br/>
<br/>
I was posting from the yahoogroups site, something I don't usually do.  But <br/>
this time I wasn't on my own computer, so I was reading the group from the <br/>
website.<br/>
<br/>
When I hit reply, it put a big loooooooooong quote in the reply box, so I <br/>
deleted 90% of it and only kept the paragraph that I meant to reply to, and then <br/>
I typed my reply under that.<br/>
<br/>
I hit preview, it looked fine, so I hit submit.<br/>
<br/>
And when it showed up, the post was the 90% that I had *deleted* from the <br/>
original post, *not* my reply along with the 10% I had meant to keep!  I don't <br/>
get it, but I guess I'll stick to replying from my own computer from now on.  My <br/>
apologies to anyone who had to read the post I sent because it was just a <br/>
loooooooooong quote and no actual reply.<br/>

&gt; I can tell you!  At least on my part.  I've done it a couple <br/>
&gt; of times, and it <br/>
&gt; was because as I was reading the email and hit reply, my cat <br/>
&gt; stepped on the <br/>
&gt; keyboard and sent it off before I was able to type anything.  <br/>
&gt; I love her, but <br/>
&gt; she hasn't mastered the Internet yet.  ;)<br/>

Someone really ought to design a "cat controls" setting, somewhat like<br/>
"parental controls," that would put your computer into sleep mode when it<br/>
receives input from the keyboard that constitutes "statistically improbably<br/>
keystrokes." Such as dfg42509bsdvkj. <br/>
<br/>
(ref. "statistically improbable phrase," from Amazon.com's "search inside<br/>
the book" feature: an "interesting, distinctive, or unlikely phrase .. that<br/>
occurs a large number of times in a particular book relative to how many<br/>
times it occurs across all Search Inside books.")<br/>
