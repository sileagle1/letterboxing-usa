                    <div class="plaintext-content">Was a Great Day Indeed.  Along with what the Head Nail said above, <br/>
there was Flutterby in attendance.  I felt honored to obtain famous <br/>
Ledger de Maine stamps and finally put some faces on the stamps I see <br/>
all over our great area.<br/>
<br/>
The day was perfectly blue and crispy.  Plenty of fallen leaves to <br/>
keep those of use who cannot resist "shoofeling" through leaves.  <br/>
Good eats with plenty of Cocoa for all.<br/>
<br/>
I failed to note who was wearing purple socks, though I did wear mine.<br/>
<br/>
Plenty of boxes left unfound by our group so a return trip is due <br/>
tomorrow.  I finished off up in the woods with Ryan, Amanda, Jodobird <br/>
and Quentus at Sunseekers "finish line" box.  Two or three Great <br/>
Horned Owls talked about the prospect of a tasty snack in the form of <br/>
Jodobirds sweet Mini Manchester Terrier.  Just about perfect when <br/>
birding and LB's come together.<br/>
<br/>
Learned some great ideas for stamping using multiple color stamps and <br/>
pens.  Some of the log books were works of art, especially Ryans and <br/>
Mischiefs from Seattle.<br/>
<br/>
A tender Hello / Goodby to Eliza B as she goes forth on her Great <br/>
Adventure.  Fare Well and I hope you find joy at every bend.<br/>
<br/>
Ryans Event stamp was also the clue sheet to his box.  Vaguely tricky <br/>
at the end, I am not sure I wuld not have found it on my own.  It is <br/>
however a work of art that he will, he says , post to his web site.<br/>
<br/>
This was a great time instigated as you know by dvn 2 skr.  To <br/>
Bethany and family ...Thanks for the Great Time.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'll put in my two honks for a job well-done by Devin Rocker (a.k.a. <br/>
Adventure Seeker).  I had a great time picking up 12 new letterboxes <br/>
along the way (and it STILL got dark before I could find them all!) <br/>
and exchanging I don't know how many stamps.<br/>
<br/>
The women of Seattle didn't have fangs nearly as long as I <br/>
suspected.  ;o)  I might even suggest that some of them were kind of <br/>
cute--but I better not.  I've learned my lesson!<br/>
<br/>
I dropped off a new hitchhiker for Funhog since, while she wasn't <br/>
able to make it, still wanted to be there "in spirit".  Her flying <br/>
pig hitchhiker certainly had the spirit!  The Canadian Goose and <br/>
family picked it up for destinations unknown.<br/>
<br/>
It also came to my attention that several people had thought my <br/>
signature stamp to be store-bought.  I'd like to thank all those <br/>
people for the back-handed compliment, because I'm happy to say that <br/>
my cute little turtle is, in fact, hand-carved.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I had a great time out there, and it was wonderful meeting <br/>
all you newbies and seeing all you oldies all over again.  Thanks for <br/>
the great time!<br/>

But Ryan...you should know it's not the size of the fangs, it's the <br/>
strength of the bite! :)<br/>
<br/>
Ahem.<br/>
<br/>
But really, we women of Seattle were just as surprised to find out <br/>
your head was not -really- embedded in your posterior and that you <br/>
were, in fact, quite nice.<br/>
<br/>
And the event stamp was a -masterpiece-, I must say.<br/>
<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Bethany, for putting this thing together!<br/>
