<br/>
Location: State: Rhode Island   County: Bristol     Town: Barrington<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Planted by: Tweety, Jessica Rose and Mr. Coon  10/14/02<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Easy. Flat walk through a complex of trails with an <br/>
interesting overall design. <br/>
                  (Be sure to notice the signboard). Good for kids. <br/>
<br/>
Driving directions:  <br/>
	From the Nockum Hill Turtle letterbox   --   drive straight <br/>
out George Street from the refuge gate between the horse pastures and <br/>
turn right (south) on Warren Road. After a half mile bear right at <br/>
the intersection onto New Meadow Road. Follow this past the Hampden <br/>
Meadows school and take the next right turn onto Massaasoit Avenue. <br/>
After crossing the river turn right at the light to head north on <br/>
County Road (Rt 114). The Osamequin Sanctuary parking area comes up <br/>
immediately after the road curves to the right the better part of a <br/>
mile along County Rd.   <br/>
	From Providence take I 195 east to Rhode Island exit 1 and <br/>
take Rt 114 the Wampanaug Trail south to Barrington. Follow this to <br/>
the traffic light in front of Barrington High School and the big <br/>
white church where you can turn around in the park and ride lot and <br/>
head back north or use the turnaround break in the center island just <br/>
before the big white church to get headed north on Rt 114.  The <br/>
Osamequin Sanctuary parking area comes up immediately after the road <br/>
curves to the right the better part of a mile along County Rd. (Rt <br/>
114) from the church (and bridge and high school )  <br/>
<br/>
Directions to the box:<br/>
	Be sure to check the signboard at the entrance gate to orient <br/>
yourself. You can bear off to the right on the yellow trail as soon <br/>
as you encounter it, or as we did go straight back out to the shore <br/>
on the green trail and turn right along the shore before turning in <br/>
to intersect the yellow trail. <br/>
At any rate stroll out toward the end of the yellow tail (Did I say <br/>
tail? I meant trail of course!)  Eventually you will come to a <br/>
culvert that brings water in and out of some flats off to your <br/>
right.  It was almost empty up in this inlet when we were here last. <br/>
Take another 14 steps past the middle of the culvert and look for a <br/>
partly overgrown singletrack side path. 7 or 8 steps along this path <br/>
is a log with a big square chunk of concrete leaning on it. The box <br/>
is tucked well in under the right hand edge of the concrete.<br/>
After returning to the midsection of the trail network you may want <br/>
to head out on the blue trail. Directly across the Hundred Acre Cove <br/>
from here is the Doug Rayner Wildlife Refuge wherein lurks the Nockum <br/>
Hill turtle letterbox. <br/>
