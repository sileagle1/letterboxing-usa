All,<br/>
<br/>
It is with some regret that I must announce I <br/>
am pulling out of the LbNA project.  Unfortunately, <br/>
my wife was recently diagnosed with Lyme disease<br/>
(early stages fortunately but because of the rash<br/>
she cannot walk -- never believe what they say about<br/>
the rash, BTW) and this is an added concern on <br/>
top of a very hectic schedule in the first place.<br/>
I do not feel I have the time or the concentration <br/>
to press on with managing the parts of the site that <br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
On July 29th, all LbNA material will be deleted <br/>
from the pil.net server.  I do not know if other <br/>
arrangements will be made to find a host for the <br/>
material or not.  I sincerely hope that they are<br/>
so that the hobby can press on without any <br/>
interruptions.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, Dr. Mings has privately (to me) offered <br/>
to host letterboxing materials; I do not know if <br/>
that offer still stands or not or if people are <br/>
comfortable with his database approach as opposed <br/>
to the geographical approach we use now.  I know I<br/>
was not and perhaps let my personal preference <br/>
cloud my judgement.  Also, I believe other of the <br/>
LbNA webmasters may be attempting to make <br/>
arrangements.  Finally, I've even recommended going <br/>
without a web site as has been successful elsewhere, <br/>
and using a more decentralized webring approach to <br/>
clue distribution.<br/>
<br/>
My clues and FAQ and the like will still be <br/>
accessible at the usual places.  I would ask <br/>
that any webmasters that arise to take over the <br/>
project in my absence link to this material rather <br/>
than copy it, or not link to it as they see fit.<br/>
I do hope to get a few more boxes out over the <br/>
coming months, and they will be on my site at<br/>
mapsurfer.com if you are interested.  I will remain<br/>
on the talk list, of course, which is fortunate<br/>
if you like long-winded e-mails ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Its been alot of fun and I wish for the strong <br/>
growth of this hobby in this country (continent :-).  <br/>
Perhaps if I have more time in the future I will<br/>
be able to contribute again, and again I apologize <br/>
for this inconvenience.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<br/>
I am very sad to hear about this situation. Best wishes for you and your<br/>
wife. I am not very knowlegable about lyme disease but hopefully she will<br/>
make a good recovery. Obviously everything else is secondary to that, but<br/>
perhaps then you may be able to return to the hobby. Even during some of<br/>
the days in the distant past where there were heated arguements about<br/>
various issues you have always been a moderating influence.<br/>
<br/>
As for my previous offer to host the site on my servers, it still remains<br/>
intact. If people should decide they are interested you can let me know.<br/>
That does NOT necessarily mean any changes to the site (i.e. geographical<br/>
versus database for the clues). I should be able to set it up so that<br/>
whomever is wants to maintain the site can have access as needed. I have<br/>
however been working on a system where people could submit clues to the<br/>
database catalog directly by email. It is a simple no maintenance<br/>
approach meant to _complement_  (NOT replace) any other clue<br/>
repositiories (such as the more eloquent map based approach that LBNA has<br/>
developed). It was my intention to offer it to be available through LBNA<br/>
or any other site that wanted to use it in addition to my site. If the<br/>
decision is made to take me up on my offer all hosting services will be<br/>
completely free. Anyone who has questions is welcome to post here or<br/>
contact me directly. Regardless of what is done, the LBNA site needs to<br/>
continue to grow and I am willing to contribute in whatever way to that end.<br/>
<br/>
Again, best wishes, and hopefully you may be able to return to the hobby<br/>
as soon as your situation permits. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">People who have read Randy's posting of yesterday are doubtless <br/>
wondering what will happen to the site after July 29. Those of us who <br/>
have helped manage the site over the past year, Mitch, Randy, John, <br/>
Jay, Erik &amp; Susan, and myself, have been discussing options over the <br/>
past two months - since letterboxing.org was redirected to Randy's <br/>
server.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us have realized for a while that hosting a site on an<br/>
individual's own web page, which usually contains other files and to <br/>
which he or she is unlikely to want to provide a password, poses a <br/>
lot of problems. It puts too much responsibility on one person to <br/>
always be there on watch. Having a site that belongs to a group, and <br/>
to which a number of managers have access, makes a lot more sense. <br/>
But there are legal, financial, and organizational issues involved <br/>
that are tough to work out.<br/>
<br/>
Our morale is a bit low right now, but I don't think any of us wants <br/>
to see all the work that everyone on this list has contributed go for <br/>
naught. We hope to have some suggestions and be getting input from <br/>
the list before the time runs out.<br/>

 I am very new to both this list and letterboxing, but<br/>
I thought I might say a couple of things...<br/>
<br/>
 One, I am very sorry to hear about the illness of the<br/>
current Webmaster's wife. I hope she's feeling better<br/>
VERY soon!<br/>
<br/>
 Two, my husband and I found out about letterboxing<br/>
because of the site. I was excrucuiatingly bored one<br/>
day and was surfing around Yahoo, looking for any<br/>
ideas for outdoor activities, and I saw<br/>
"Letterboxing". I had NO idea what letterboxing was,<br/>
so I clicked on the link, and voila! Now we've built<br/>
our first stamp and are planning to place MANY<br/>
letterboxes around the SF Bay Area during this summer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Without that site, we would have been sunk. I don't<br/>
normally subscribe to mailing groups, and having a<br/>
centralised clue location on the web facilitiates a<br/>
growing hobby, as far as I can see. If I had to hunt<br/>
and search various websites in a desperate search for<br/>
the few letterboxes in California, I don't think we<br/>
would have become half as excited about letterboxing<br/>
as we are now.<br/>
<br/>
 My idea was, why not put the site onto a public<br/>
server? There are quite a few around, and one even<br/>
offers 100mb of space for the site, which should be<br/>
enough?? It's free, and that way there wouldn't be any<br/>
private areas to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
 I'd be happy to contribute my time to work with a<br/>
team to categorize clues and place them on the site..<br/>
I do have a small amount of HTML experience and can<br/>
muddle my way through most HTML and some JAVA<br/>
coding...<br/>
<br/>
 Anyhow, I want to say it's been wonderful becoming<br/>
involved with this, and I very much enjoy reading all<br/>
of your letters!<br/>

&gt; &gt; It is with some regret that I must announce I <br/>
&gt; &gt; am pulling out of the LbNA project. <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, <br/>
&gt; &gt; my wife was recently diagnosed with Lyme disease<br/>
&gt; &gt; (early stages fortunately but because of the rash<br/>
&gt; &gt; she cannot walk -- never believe what they say<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; the rash, BTW) and this is an added concern on <br/>
&gt; &gt; top of a very hectic schedule in the first place.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I do not feel I have the time or the concentration<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; to press on with managing the parts of the site<br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; I do.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; On July 29th, all LbNA material will be deleted <br/>
&gt; &gt; from the pil.net server.  I do not know if other <br/>
&gt; &gt; arrangements will be made to find a host for the <br/>
&gt; &gt; material or not.  I sincerely hope that they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; so that the hobby can press on without any <br/>
&gt; &gt; interruptions.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In the past, Dr. Mings has privately (to me)<br/>
&gt; offered <br/>
&gt; &gt; to host letterboxing materials; I do not know if <br/>
&gt; &gt; that offer still stands or not or if people are <br/>
&gt; &gt; comfortable with his database approach as opposed <br/>
&gt; &gt; to the geographical approach we use now.  I know I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was not and perhaps let my personal preference <br/>
&gt; &gt; cloud my judgement.  Also, I believe other of the <br/>
&gt; &gt; LbNA webmasters may be attempting to make <br/>
&gt; &gt; arrangements.  Finally, I've even recommended<br/>
&gt; going <br/>
&gt; &gt; without a web site as has been successful<br/>
&gt; elsewhere, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and using a more decentralized webring approach to<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; clue distribution.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My clues and FAQ and the like will still be <br/>
&gt; &gt; accessible at the usual places.  I would ask <br/>
&gt; &gt; that any webmasters that arise to take over the <br/>
&gt; &gt; project in my absence link to this material rather<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; than copy it, or not link to it as they see fit.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I do hope to get a few more boxes out over the <br/>
&gt; &gt; coming months, and they will be on my site at<br/>
&gt; &gt; mapsurfer.com if you are interested.  I will<br/>
&gt; remain<br/>
&gt; &gt; on the talk list, of course, which is fortunate<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Its been alot of fun and I wish for the strong <br/>

How glad I was to see your post!  truly, we need people to step forward with ideas and offers of assistance to maintian this ever growing endeavor.  Thank you for sharing your experience with the website.  It's heartwarming, and renews my faith that it deoes indeed serve a worthwhile purpose.<br/>
As to your idea about putting the site on a public server, we have shyed (sp?) away from that in the past because of the ads.  They do drive me nuts.  But I think given our current situation, a public website might very well be the best solution.<br/>
<br/>
Thabnk you for stepping forward.  I have no dobt your offer of assistance will be picked up very very soon.<br/>

annoying.  But, I think the fact that our site is about a hobby is clear to<br/>
visitors--we're not a slick, for-profit dot-com, we're a hobby contributed<br/>
to voluntarily by lots of different people with different interests. I<br/>
personally wouldn't be surprised to see a Web site for a hobby on a public<br/>
server.  I hope visitors would realize that the ads are simply a necessary<br/>
evil on a "free" space.<br/>
<br/>
I'd just like to vote "no" on Geocities, however.  I have friends with<br/>
Geocities Web sites, and quite often when I try to access their pages, I<br/>
get a message saying the page couldn't be found.  Then, next time, for no<br/>
apparent reason, the page downloads without a hitch.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a friend with a site on Tripod.  Never had any problems<br/>
accessing his Tripod pages - for what it's worth.<br/>
