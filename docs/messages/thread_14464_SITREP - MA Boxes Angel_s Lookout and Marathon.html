Duckie'sFamily waddled by these two boxes today...<br/>
<br/>
here are my reports for them :)<br/>
<br/>
Angel's Lookout - Great site, pretty buggy, but the kids liked it :) Alan <br/>
(my 3 and 1/2 year old), wanted to climb to the top...we didn't let him <br/>
cause we didn't want him to fall off...<br/>
the box was in great shape, no problems finding it and the stamp and log <br/>
book were in good shape.... it was a blast to find this one...Thanks <br/>
warrior woman for this one!<br/>
<br/>
Marathon - Neat site, missed it at first, went in, found it...it was in <br/>
great condition...the box was a little damp inside but the book and stamp <br/>
were dry as a bone...it was very pretty site!<br/>
                  thanks again to warrior woman....<br/>
<br/>
these two boxes were a lot of fun....we were going to do piece of cake, but <br/>
decided the kids had enough excitement for one day...so we came home...<br/>
