Sure would save a lot of duplication in posting questions on the <br/>
website status to multiple message boards not affiliated with the AQ <br/>
website.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I'm sure Ryan has an email address and would be happy to <br/>
answer questions about his website directly.<br/>

&gt; The server was being twitchy and he needed to do some <br/>
maintenance.  It <br/>
&gt; should be all good today.<br/>

news about letterboxing is okay?<br/>
 Frankly I'm glad that AQ has so many different boards as it keeps <br/>
some of the inane off of this one.(last comment not directed toward <br/>
anyone, just an opinion of some of the AQ chatter)<br/>
