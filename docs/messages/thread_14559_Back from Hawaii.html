Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I have been very busy and not even reading most of your list, sorry! <br/>
(You see us in HONOR LIBERTY HH) but I tried to do many letterboxes <br/>
on Vacation, Attempts where  hard since I really did not want to <br/>
move an inch and had my 2 bitty children with me. We were only <br/>
successful on one on Oahu. Even that one was pretty tough. Thus the <br/>
reason for my post: <br/>
<br/>
I would love to see more of the letterboxes _clues_ or _ablilty to <br/>
ask_ the box manager the following - 1) walking miles or incline, 2) <br/>
if and what kind of stroller friendly (sport or travel), or at least <br/>
kid friendly, 3) shoe type (slippers or boots). 4) A padded attempt <br/>
time from parking and 5) driving time from near by places? <br/>
<br/>
I know I am asking alot but It would make my attempts which I have <br/>
to squeeze in better planned since we are usually on vacation and <br/>
with hardy children. I have bad RA arthritus but can still walk/hike <br/>
pretty far, but kids have limits even if previously tortured. We <br/>
only had slippers(flip flops) on island and we needed real shoes for <br/>
some attempts.<br/>
<br/>
I am probalby going to get flamed for asking for soo much but we <br/>
love finding them and it is so disappointing when we fail.  We can <br/>
not all be wandering super-wandas!  some of us are LAMO-mommie-<br/>
forced me up a really hot cliff for nothing! Perhaps some other achy-<br/>
broken people may support some of these clue info addons? Or <br/>
suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>

We did not find either at the lighthouse - Makapuu point and we did <br/>
not even finish the attempt at Lanikai it is very very steep. But <br/>
the one in the botanic gardens was very nice - not really great for <br/>
the stroller, but we made it. Take a bunch of water!  I have <br/>
contacted the placers of the Makapuu Point and never heard back...<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps?<br/>

O'ahu LB 'stroller assessment' rundown:<br/>
<br/>
Silent Sentinel/Celestial Beings--stroller friendly for the most <br/>
part (except you'll have to carry it around one locked gate and <br/>
possibly a boulder on the side--otherwise it's paved almost the <br/>
entire way, although entirely uphill one direction, downhill the <br/>
other)<br/>
<br/>
Lanikai Bunker--not stroller friendly, steep, gravelly/dirt trail <br/>
with jagged cliffs on either side at point--I took two little ones <br/>
up there but would have preferred to have another adult with me at <br/>
the time--it drizzled the entire time but the view at the top was <br/>
sooooo worth the effort. I carried the little one in a baby backpack-<br/>
-I would only recommend this for very strong &amp; sure-fitted hikers--<br/>
spent some time climbing the trail on my 'bottom' at points<br/>
<br/>
Koko Crater--relatively flat, gravel trail, all-terrain wheeled <br/>
stroller friendly but umbrella handled type strollers I would never <br/>
even consider taking--no water in the area &amp; quite hot but an <br/>
absolutely incredible spot--especially if you're into plants and <br/>
seeing things from other parts of the world that you'd never see in <br/>
the US except for in Hawaii!!!<br/>
<br/>
'Awapuhi-'ula'ula (Wild Red Ginger)--dirt/gravel trail--not terribly <br/>
stroller friendly--could possibly take an all-terrain wheeled <br/>
stroller but otherwise I would only recommend hikers and baby-<br/>
backpacks<br/>
<br/>
Falling Mauna*wili --dirt/gravel trail, steep at times, muddy alot, <br/>
stream crossing required--hikers only, baby backpack<br/>
<br/>
Monk Seal--dirt/gravel/deep sand trail--one steep point that <br/>
requires boulder scrambling while holding a steel cable otherwise <br/>
flat the entire way--could bring a stroller but I'd leave an adult <br/>
with the child in stroller at the trail prior to the cable (trade <br/>
off to stamp into the box--approx 1/2 mile from that point)--<br/>
otherwise, the hike could be completed with a stroller if you <br/>
attempt it from the North side--much milder trail<br/>
<br/>
Pueo--gravel, grass, dirt, pine-needle, mango pit covered trail <br/>
throughout--a few steep parts of the trail although a short hike <br/>
with incredible views--I'd bring kids if they were able hikers--I <br/>
wouldn't recommend a stroller unless you're used to pushing up dirt <br/>
trails and carrying it down 'trail steps' at points<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Barring any letterboxes placed on O'ahu since 23 July 03--this is my <br/>
best assessment of currently existing letterboxes in the region.  <br/>
Hope this helps in your plans!<br/>

Boy shure wish we had this chatty chatty before we flew - but we <br/>
will be back next summer we are Oahu regulars.  We usually do <br/>
Makapuu lighthouse hike any way so the letterboxes where just going <br/>
to be extra gratification. This was around Transpac (the boat race) <br/>
so July 20th or so? We went up and down counting 6 times from <br/>
Celestial Beings last clear starting point, looked under everything <br/>
but we felt we where just trampling so we moved on..The next one, We <br/>
then went up the trail then counted several times and got seriously <br/>
spiked, but I did find a case of unused 35mm film! so hows that for <br/>
the other sentinel. We also are pretty aware of the problems of <br/>
Hawaiian extremes so we where ready. OUr 6yr old did not like the <br/>
wind at Makapuu pooooint but that was funny anyway.  I aggree the <br/>
koko crater is amazing but seriously hot - this would be good in the <br/>
morning. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we could chatty offline before we come next time - seems <br/>
like we need extra guidance-- ha ha ...between diapers and snacks, <br/>
whinning it is sometimes hard to read directions. Our 2 year old is <br/>
too large for the backpack, well at least for my back, and we <br/>
already haul to much stuff on island for the boat event.<br/>
