and have to say we really enjoyed those few days of glorious <br/>
warm sunshine before having to head back to the ice and snow <br/>
of New England!  We only had enough time to visit a couple of <br/>
places, namely Pasadena, San Luis Obispo and Kernville, but <br/>
that was sufficient to give us a good sampling of what's out there <br/>
 some very beautiful areas indeed!  We particularly enjoyed <br/>
camping at Montaa de Oro near SLO, and visiting some of the <br/>
other local "haunts", but most of all, we loved getting to visit with <br/>
Don and Gwen on our side trip to Kernville.  Not only have they <br/>
done a wonderful job covering the whole area with letterboxes, <br/>
but they cook some fantastic barbeque and tell some great <br/>
stories, too!  (Ask them about "the groover!")  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone who possibly can, should really try to get to Kernville for <br/>
that gathering they're hosting next month.  Wish we could be <br/>
there, too, but since we can't, maybe the few hitchers we left <br/>
behind can represent us "in spirit"!<br/>
<br/>
The gathering is April 24th and details including the free <br/>
whitewater raft trip and Saturday night BBQ may be found at<br/>
