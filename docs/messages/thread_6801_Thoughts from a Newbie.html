                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>&lt;&lt;1. Isn't it cool? I have been to places I never would have seen without
<br/>boxing. I also have gone up hills (Rattlesnake Ledge, moderate my tush) I
<br/>would have never attempted if not for a box hidden there.&gt;&gt;
<br/>
<br/>I've got to agree on this one. We've been hikers in our family for years, but we had a tendency to only go to the same places that we liked. Since a friend of ours turned us on to this hobby last month, we've been to a large variety of trails and parks in three states, most of which we'd never been to before, and a few of which we hadn't been back to in years. We're putting together our first few boxes, and I can't wait to place them out at some of my favorite spots for others to enjoy.
<br/>
<br/>I suppose none of the strangeness of the posts this past week should surprise me. Every Internet group, no matter what, always goes through periods like this. I know it won't scare our family away from this hobby, and I certainly hope that it won't drive anyway else out either. Don't let the trolls win! :-)
<br/>
<br/>On the subject of P counts, and the new designations that have started showing up, I think some of them are pretty cool (I like the "V" for virtual boxes, for example), some are silly/funny, and some don't seem to belong. But I don't think it really matters all that much what people choose to count or how they do it. That doesn't mean that I think we should run out and update the FAQ with an "L" count, but if it doesn't affect you, who cares? Live and let live, I say.
