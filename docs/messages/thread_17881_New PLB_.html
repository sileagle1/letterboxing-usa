                    <div class="plaintext-content">  Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
      I just wanted to say that I have started my<br/>
first PLB! I have made it to be geared towards kids<br/>
and their families! I have three little ones ages 7yrs<br/>
and under and we love to get PLBoxes! So I thought I<br/>
would design one specifically for kids to do with<br/>
their parents! So I have made a letterbox that is<br/>
going to have a few coloring books and other little<br/>
games to play for kids or even the kids at heart! <br/>
<br/>
      We just had a big crisis here at my house my<br/>
littlest(20 months) fell out the window Tuesday night<br/>
the 4th, about a 10 foot drop! I was at Walmart when<br/>
it happened getting supplies for this PLB and her dad<br/>
was watching the kids! When I returned home I found<br/>
granddad here with our other two kids(7yrs and<br/>
3.5yrs)! :-( Aubrey is fine no injuries except bruises<br/>
they kept her overnight at the hospital! We are<br/>
soooooo lucky! So my point is, I want to name the box<br/>
after my Dare Devil jump out the window little girl!<br/>
So the name of the box is Kamikaze Aubrey! <br/>
<br/>
      It will have some activities in it that will<br/>
require mom or dad and will be a little messy! So keep<br/>
that in mind when you sign up! I do not mind if other<br/>
people are added to this list, what I mean by that is<br/>
if you are on the list and you have a friend that<br/>
lives near you that you can exchange the box with and<br/>
then get it back quickly then that is not a problem! I<br/>
would prefer not to add extra mailing addresses after<br/>
the box is closed though! I would also like this box<br/>
to travel with delivery confirmation! Any mail service<br/>
is fine with me as long as it has delivery<br/>
confirmation! I am going to have to restrict this box<br/>
to only 50 people or families! Also I need to know how<br/>
many kids or people will be participating per family<br/>
so I make sure I have enough coloring pages!:-)<br/>
<br/>
I am rather new to letterboxing so my carving skills<br/>
are not wonderful so I hope my hand carved words are<br/>
somewhat easy to read! :-) LOL<br/>
<br/>
       Thanks so much! So please sign up if this<br/>
sounds like something you would like! ;-) My email is<br/>

This is purely my opinion...This is a web based talk list. You might not want to post <br/>
the ages of your young children for open viewing on the web. I'm not saying that <br/>
anyone on this list might be mailicious, just that it might not be a good idea. Email <br/>
can be read by anyone and everyone that wants to get their hands on your info.<br/>
<br/>

   Thanks so much! I had not given much thought to it!<br/>
I have read your "General Hardass" LOL version and I<br/>
completely agree! Thanks so much for pointing those<br/>
things out to me! I will be more careful! :-) <br/>
