                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ft. Canby Lighthouse Letterboxes were placed by Amanda Briles (aka The<br/>
Paisley Orca) and John in Ilwaco, Washington (Pacific County) on<br/>
3/3/2001.  The way to both lighthouses is wheelchair accessible, but the<br/>
letterboxes are not.<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
North Head Lighthouse<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From Ilwaco, Washington, follow signs to Ft. Canby State<br/>
Park on Loop 100.  Once on this road follow signs to the North Head<br/>
Lighthouse.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Easy.  Compass readings courtesy of John.<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  Easy.  Very short distance from the parking area to where<br/>
the letterbox is and to where the lighthouse is.  The path to the<br/>
lighthouse is flat compacted gravel.  The letterbox path is grassy and<br/>
uneven with an uphill incline to start off.<br/>
<br/>
North Head Letterbox:  Park in the parking area and take the Lighthouse<br/>
Trail.  Go past the Lighthouse keeper residence.  Just after the bench<br/>
take the immediate path to your right and up.  Keep following this path<br/>
straight through clearing areas with "Big Bonzai" to your left and let<br/>
the top of the lighthouse be your guide.  Go forward as far as you can<br/>
until the bushes stop you.  At 70 degrees magnetic North, what do you<br/>
see?  Go around the tree.  The lowest branch on the ocean side harbors<br/>
the Northhead Lighthouse Letterbox.<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------- Cape<br/>
Disappointment Lighthouse<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Go out the way you came on the North Head Lighthouse Road.<br/>
When you reach Loop 100 go right and follow the signs to the Lewis and<br/>
Clark Interpretive Center.  Follow signs that say Spur 100 once you're<br/>
in Ft. Canby State Park.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Easy to Moderate.  Compass readings courtesy of John.<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  Easy to Moderate.  Trail is 1-1/2 mile round trip.  Up and<br/>
down dirt path.  Some small sets of stairs along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Cape Disappointment Letterbox:  From the Lewis &amp; Clark Interpretive<br/>
Center parking area walk in the direction that Lewis &amp; Clark are<br/>
pointing.  This is the Cape D Lighthouse trailhead.  Take this trail all<br/>
the way to where the lighthouse is.  <br/>
<br/>
When on these grounds one of the first things you will see is a<br/>
microwave tower surrounded by a brown fence.  From the middle pole on<br/>
the West side of this fence, look 270 degrees.  Halfway up the first set<br/>
of stairs you come to at the base of the lighthouse, look to 15 degrees.<br/>
The spot you see from these two viewpoints is the destination you seek.<br/>
Python will snake you toward the Cape Disappointment Letterbox.<br/>
