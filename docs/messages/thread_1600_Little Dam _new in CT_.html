                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, V&amp;V! We did indeed redo the Little Dam letterbox in <br/>
Ledyard, CT. Here's the clues:<br/>
<br/>
Little Dam <br/>
<br/>
(Vandalized in July '00 and then expanded into a four-box series in <br/>
November '00)<br/>
<br/>
A quietly pretty hike on the Narragansett Trail in Ledyard CT, <br/>
leading to a small scenic dam. Cover an easy 3.5 miles total, up and <br/>
along Wintechog Hill, with an elevation of about 400 feet, on an out-<br/>
and-back route. This hike is just west of the Tribal Nation <br/>
letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: On CT Rte. 2, just south of the Mashantucket Pequot's <br/>
Foxwoods Casino, turn west on Wintechog Hill Rd. Travel 0.8 miles, <br/>
passing the trail and parking area for the Tribal Nation letterbox at <br/>
Lantern Hill, to the town dump entrance on your right. Flip a u-turn <br/>
and park in a little pull out spot on the right (south) side of the <br/>
road. On foot, backtrack 100 feet to the blue blazed trail.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the trail on the south side of the road generally southeast. <br/>
You'll dip and climb gently in hardwood and mountain laurel until you <br/>
meet a stone wall on your left that abruptly ends. Slip around behind <br/>
on the east side to find the Abrupt End letterbox hidden in a chink <br/>
in the wall.<br/>
<br/>
The trail turns eastward along the hill. After about 1/4 mile, cross <br/>
an open area like an old forest road (it's a natural gas pipeline, <br/>
and is worth a short detour up the hill to the south for a peek if <br/>
you'd like). After the open area, the trail passes through a north-<br/>
south running wall. Turn north to a corner in the stone to find the <br/>
Junkyard View letterbox in the wall under a quartz marker rock. <br/>
Careful of the barbed wire!<br/>
<br/>
Continuing along Wintechog Hill, cross another wall with a similar <br/>
corner to the left, and then pass through a lower, tumbled wall. The <br/>
trail suddenly bends right and uphill on a small rocky scramble. Next <br/>
climb gently to the south before turning west. At a wall, bend to the <br/>
left again and come to a rocky, steep, short drop-off pointing to <br/>
150ï‚°, where you might even need to use your hands a little for <br/>
balance. Before going down, look to the north behind a tree for the <br/>
Sunny Outcrop letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Now scramble down and continue eastwards on the trail, passing a <br/>
classic (and beautiful) glacial kettlehole. In about 1/2 mile, the <br/>
trail descends Winchetog hill and exits into a pretty field crossed <br/>
by a power line. In the stone wall just before leaving the woods into <br/>
the field, take about seven steps to the left to find the Gallup Pond <br/>
letterbox low in the south face of the wall.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the hill and the forest behind, emerge into an old field and <br/>
follow the trail to Gallup Pond, right next to busy Rte. 2. Explore <br/>
the small dam and spillway, and enjoy the views of the pond with its <br/>
dark, tannin-rich waters. You could turn north on Rte 2 for two miles <br/>
to your car, but with the congested casino traffic, we do not <br/>
recommend it. Far better to enjoy the walk back on the trail, <br/>
returning the way you came. Thanks for sharing this hike with us!<br/>
