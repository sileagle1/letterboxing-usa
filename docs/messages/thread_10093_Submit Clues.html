<div>CURVES IN NATURE</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By: GinJax2</div>
<div>Date Placed: November 13, 2002</div>
<div>Location: Near St. Helen, Roscommon Co. 
MI</div>
<div>Difficulty: Easy, may be a little more challenging 
in the winter</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Begin by driving approximately 2.5 miles south 
on F-97 (Maple Valley Road) from Old M-55. You will turn onto the road just 
before the cemetary. Park on the south side of this road next to the cemetary. 
Walk up the hill on this wooded road and at the top of the hill look to your 
right and find a large moss covered stump with its roots pointing to the sky. 
Stand by the center of the stump and take a compass reading of 170 degrees. 
Follow the curve of the clearing on the right to the gathering of young pines. 
Stand at the southern end of these trees and take a compass reading of 44 
degrees. Walk 13 paces to the time-worn and weathered curved stump. New growth 
from old is just beyond your reach and it is there that you will find your 
prize.</div></body></html>
