Just got back from Las Vegas. We had planned on hitting about 20 letterboxes but of course we only got to one. We rented a car for one day while we were in Las Vegas and headed out to Red Rock Canyon. This is a beautiful area!! I would highly recommend getting off the strip and seeing the nature side of Las Vegas. We found the Lost Lizard Box in excellent shape. We were the first finders even though the box was planted three weeks ago!! (That would never happen here in the midwest!) Lizard girl picked a great spot for this box. If you are in Las Vegas, take the time to find this box. It is well worth the time.<br/>
