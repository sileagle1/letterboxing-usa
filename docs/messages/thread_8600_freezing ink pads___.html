                    <html><body><p>Ken,
</p><p>I have a letterbox (unpublished at this point) with pigment ink stamp pad in the Adirondacks in NY where night temps have been below freezing off and on for the last few weeks. I am wintering it over to see how the whole box holds up in the 120"+ snow fall  and -30F temps that area receives....not to mention bears and other curious critters.
</p><p>I am going there (from CT) this weekend and if the weather cooperates, I plan to check on it to see how it's faring so far. If it survives there, South Carolina would be a piece of cake. 
</p><p>You could also put a stamp pad in your freezer for a time, thaw it and see what happens.
</p><p>Also, don't forget that letterboxers carry their own stamp pads too!

                    <html><body><p>Hi, I've only gone through 1 winter letterboxing in CT. It was rather mild but was well below freezing. The stamp pads did not break. At times they looked fine but the ink must have been frozen. All you have to do to use them is to open it up and blow on the pad. The warmth of your breath will thaw out enough to get enough ink for a stamp. After winter was gone the stamps were fine and had no problems. .....Chuck and Molly in CT
