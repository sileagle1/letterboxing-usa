<p>The Habitat Trail Letterbox <br/>Burr Oak Woods <br/>Blue Springs, MO <br/>Jackson County <br/>Placed on August 1, 2002 
</p><p>Burr Oak Woods Conservation Area is located in Blue Springs, Missouri. From I-70, go north on Highway 7 and turn left at Park Road. Stay on Park Road until you reach the first parking lot on the left. Access to two trails begins here. Enter the Habitat Trail at the south end of the parking lot. </p>
<p>The ice storm of January 2002 drastically changed the landscape of  Burr Oak Woods.  As you walk the trail you will see many trees that either fell during the storm or had to be cut down afterwards.  One such tree will lead you to our letterbox.</p>
<p>Follow the Habitat Trail past the small pond until you reach the Glade, Missouri's driest habitat.  There you can read about "Only the Tough Can Survive" on a signpost by a splitrail fence.  Start at the last rail and walk about 240 paces and you should see about ten hollow tree logs lined up to the right.  From there count 85 paces further along the trail you will see a small thorny tree to the right.  Now walk about 64 paces and stop.  Look to the right for 6 hollow tree logs (about 2 ft. in diameter) that are in a fairly even line and are situated about 12 ft. from the path.  There is a much longer log just beyond these six.  Step off  the trail and start looking for our letterbox in a nearby hollow tree that is very close to this last log.</p>
