As promised, I removed the "moderate group" feature for this list.  The only <br/>
address we continued to moderate was the one that had previously been sending <br/>
long argumentative messages to the list.<br/>
<br/>
The next message from that address began, "This is an angry post!..."<br/>
<br/>
The post was returned to the sender with an explanation that we would not <br/>
publish angry posts.  Of the two moderators who were in place at the time the <br/>
message was sent, it was I who chose to return the questionable message to <br/>
its sender.  It is my responsibility as the creator and manager of this <br/>
listserv to protect its 64 members from angry, destructive posts of this <br/>
nature.<br/>
<br/>
This person has continued to send angry messages to many of our group members <br/>
personally.  There is nothing I can do about this except recommend that you <br/>
contact him individually and ask him to stop.  I'm very sorry for this <br/>
unfortunate situation.<br/>
<br/>
I want you all to know that at this point in time, there are ABSOLUTELY NO <br/>
MODERATION parameters in place for this talk list.  If the previous list <br/>
abuser or anyone else should again decide to start flooding this list with <br/>
angry, argumentative posts, then it will become necessary to apply moderation <br/>
parameters again.  In the future, such decisions will be discussed on the <br/>
letterbox-vision talk list, and decisions will be made in a democratic <br/>
fashion.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your patience and understanding in this difficult time.<br/>
