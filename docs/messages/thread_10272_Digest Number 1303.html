&gt; I know that you can just leave the hitchhiker for someone else to<br/>
&gt; deal with, but I find that hitchhikers are the Lazy Man's letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Which is a good point.  I've always thought the world (or at least<br/>
letterboxing) would be better off if we all just ignored what we didn't<br/>
like.  I mean, I ignore the "geojunk" I find in geocaches and letterboxes<br/>
(that I believe geocachers leave in them) and that seems to work out<br/>
(sorry, I just love that word, and had to find a way to use it ... I<br/>
really have nothing against geocaching, but ain't that a pretty word ...)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, onto the specific point -- I wish everyone was as "lazy"<br/>
as to create something like the Hatbox Caper and the 9 hitchhikers<br/>
that are part of the bargain.  It took me alot of effort to do that,<br/>
and I never considered it lazy.  I really think its kinda cool, and an<br/>
example of a way to turn the putative ubiquitous hitchhiker lemons into<br/>
lemonade (putative, ubiquitous, or otherwise).  As with all things,<br/>
there is the good, the bad, and the ugly (the sentence before being an<br/>
example of the "ugly"), and sometimes "in moderation" makes sense,<br/>
sometimes geojunk dilutes the beauty, but we all agree that unagi is<br/>
the best sushi.<br/>
<br/>
So, thats my final answer in this thread.  Can't wait to download my<br/>
mail on the morrow ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

I can see how if your are finding one in almost every box<br/>
then "mystic" is gone. I hear complaints of too few also. I've only<br/>
found a few but it doesn't bother me. I wonder if there is a third<br/>

I think what you're seeing is a case of geographic displacement. I did some <br/>
writing on hitchhikers on my site recently<br/>
(http://www.letterboxing.info/articles/00000010.shtml) and I figured that<br/>
as of November 2002, there were approximately 280 hitchhikers in<br/>
circulation in the United States. With more than 2,500 letterboxes in the<br/>
U.S., you ought to find a hitchhiker in every ten letterboxes you find (on<br/>
average). I expect that the average is actually lower since a number of<br/>
those hitchhikers are often in someone's backpack or sitting on their desk<br/>
for stretches of time between letterboxing excursions, and another number<br/>
are almost certainly lost since there's no way of knowing for sure if<br/>
they're still in existent. (Of course, there may also be more hitchhikers<br/>
that have never been announced publicly, as well.)<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I've found 4 hitchhikers and 81 letterboxes, or half of what<br/>
you'd expect from the raw numbers. When I was in Nebraska, I found 8 boxes<br/>
(just about all of the boxes in existence in the greater Omaha/Lincoln area <br/>
at the time) and no hitchhikers; I've found 17 boxes in PA and no<br/>
hitchhikers; 12 boxes in Michigan and no hitchhikers; but 20 boxes in New<br/>
Jersey and 2 hitchhikers.<br/>
<br/>
Judging from the talk on the LBNA list, lots of people have never found<br/>
hitchhikers, and they get very excited when they finally do. From that, and <br/>
from the numbers themselves, I'd<br/>
<br/>
But if your neck of the woods is oversaturated with hitchhikers, then I'd<br/>
agree that it's the right thing to do for 'boxers in that area to hold off<br/>
on planting new hitchhikers, and to make an effort to move the hitchhikers<br/>
outwards, away from the epicenter of 'contamination' <g>. There are a lot<br/>
of 'boxers out there who would be thrilled to find just one!<br/>

Maybe we need a Hitchhiker Transport Service (HTS) to move them from West <br/>
to<br/>
East and East to West, not to mention the overseas and downunder cycle.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any UPS or FedEx couriers out there?<br/>

I'd like to address Amanda's comments about too many hitchhikers and <br/>
calling<br/>
them lazy man's boxes.  I've only planted two.....of which to my knowledge<br/>
have yet to be found a single time since August.  I'll admit that it was<br/>
easier to put them in a ready made box.....but the stamps I carved were<br/>
labor intensive and are well done in my opinion.   I also haven't found a <br/>
single hh, maybe it is a more regional thing? Sue<br/>

I found this amusing article on the web at<br/>
http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?<br/>
tmpl=story&amp;ncid=573&amp;e=6&amp;cid=573&amp;u=/nm/20030114/od_nm/lavalamp_dc<br/>
<br/>
Basically, it says some folks are interested in building a 60 foot<br/>
high lava lamp in the center of downtown to help draw tourists<br/>
and 'save' the slowly diminishing town.  I have to admit, I'd be a<br/>
sucker for it to.  If there was a 60 foot tall lava lamp within a<br/>
hundred miles of me, I'd be on it in a heartbeat!  =)<br/>
<br/>
But you've got to wonder--why don't the residents hide a few dozen<br/>
letterboxes?  It's a heck of a lot cheaper, and that would get me out<br/>
there as well!  But you got to give them credit, they definitely<br/>
think big!<br/>

Oops--I totally forgot, I found one of my own HHs on a recent<br/>
letterboxing trip (My Favorite Things) last week.  I only took it so<br/>
I could fix it at home (maintenance reasons--another reason to NOT<br/>
use Speedball's white carving medium from Michaels--it falls apart<br/>
almost instantly!!!) otherwise it would have stayed there for the<br/>
next lucky finder instead.  Still need more sleep...but still<br/>
looking forward to finding other folks' hitchhikers, too!  ;)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings from the Secret Gardeners in Canada ! The weather up here is<br/>
perfect for letterboxing, so come on up ! We travelled to Victoria, on<br/>
Vancouver Island, last weekend - the flowering cherry trees are flowering<br/>
and bulbs are up. While there we checked on Canada Goose's "20 Bucks" It is<br/>
high and dry and has seen visitors from all over North America. We also<br/>
picked up a couple of boxes, as well as planted a couple of micro boxes, "<br/>
Beacon &amp; Jester" - see attached. Looking forward to a spring gathering -<br/>
maybe up here?<br/>
Happy Hunting, the Secret Gardeners<br/>
