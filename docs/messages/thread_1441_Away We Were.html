Couple of replies here. Cock-A-Doodle-Moo has asked  people to send <br/>
back a full book so we can display it at our 4-H fair. We will send a <br/>
letterboxing suprise to anyone who does so.  In the box I just <br/>
planted in Kentucky I added spare books as it may be a long while <br/>
before I could service those boxes. <br/>
  Also I sent in clues awhile ago for 2 new Canadian boxes but <br/>
noticed our Canada site has not been updated and says there is only <br/>
one. I  know someone else said he planted one at PEI and Cape Breton <br/>
so there should be 5 now.  Realize you may all be busy but the busy <br/>
hiking season is quick to wrap up , just hoping someone might get out <br/>
there before the weather is completely discouraging. <br/>
  We look forward to our patches hope the order process goes smooth , <br/>
it is a great way to promote our hobby.<br/>
   Lastly the 50 in 2000 ( states) I saw people from all our missing <br/>
states and gave them packets asking them to plant a box or pass it to <br/>
someone who would. These are all Agriculture students I saw ,so I <br/>
asked for it to go to a Natural Resource or outdoor education teacher <br/>
if they  couldn't help us themselves. So now we can wait and see if <br/>
it works.  I'll keep my fingers crossed! I included my email so I'll <br/>
let the group know if I get a response. So much for today, check out <br/>
the clues for two new boxes I planted while in Kentucky. Carol ,in -<br/>
lots of unpacking to do, glad to be home in Ct. <br/>
