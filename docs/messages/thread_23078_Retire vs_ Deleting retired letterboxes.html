                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sometimes missing (and retired) boxes do reappear!  I have no idea why <br/>
but I've had several of my missing boxes come back to life with no help <br/>
from me after a LONG while.  I figure somebody found the box, took it <br/>
home with them, had no idea what they had until they researched it a <br/>
bit, when they figure it out sometimes it takes a while to return back <br/>
to the area to replace it and eventually it returns.<br/>
<br/>
One letterbox in the Seattle area hidden by a lady who didn't live in <br/>
the area was picked up by another lady who, while visiting the area, <br/>
went for a hike, found the letterbox, took it home, threw it in her <br/>
suitcase, took an extended trip to Japan, researched what it was and <br/>
eventually returned it to the original hiding spot (perhaps by way of <br/>
the owner who lives in New England?)--months and months later.  It <br/>
happens!  You just never know!<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I had a mystery box that I received multiple missing <br/>
reports on.  I went to its hiding spot two different times and <br/>
confirmed it was missing both times.  Returned again just for some <br/>
exercise and lo &amp; behold found it alive &amp; well on the opposite side of <br/>
the structure under which it was hidden.  Turns out a geocache was <br/>
later hidden in the area in a similar manner and the geocachers kept <br/>
finding and rehiding the letterbox in a slightly different location <br/>
causing many of the letterboxers to report it missing (including the <br/>
box owner!!!).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good points about keeping the retired boxes with the clues/descriptions in the database. There seems to be quite a few LBers who feel that letterboxing is about the hike and discovering a beautiful place more than it is about finding the box. They might enjoy hiking out to spots that used to have a box. And some may even plant a new box where the retired box once lay - something they might not have done if they didn't know about the spot.<br/>
<br/>
I like the counting feature and I like to look back at and re-read the clues to boxes that I've found, so I'd be disappointed to see a retired box removed from the site. <br/>
<br/>
I wonder how difficult it would be for the webmasters to suppress boxes marked retired but still keep them in the database and make them searchable.<br/>

<br/>
Having just adopted (why oh why did I do this?) about 30 abandoned <br/>
letterboxes, I believe I'd like to keep the clues posted for the boxes <br/>
I can't find because 1) they may actually still be out there, and B) I <br/>
like the historical aspect of the cool early boxes planted circa 2001.<br/>
