Regarding the NPS morning report that was reposted here - it is <br/>
inaccurate. When it came out there was quite a bit of discussion on <br/>
the geocaching forums and it turns out if I remember correctly, that <br/>
the 'caches' weren't buried at all. The author just assumed <br/>
that 'cache' meant 'buried'. The idea that most 'caches' <br/>
or 'letterboxes' are buried is something that just isn't true but <br/>
keeps floating around like a bad urban legend. (The author also makes <br/>
an assertion about "the damage geocaching has and can cause to <br/>
historic, archeological and natural sites" without any facts to <br/>
support the claim. "HAS" not "might". That slanted statement really <br/>
boils my blood.) For anyone who wants to see the original NPS report <br/>
in its entirety, it is at <br/>
http://www.nps.gov/morningreport/msg00806.html<br/>
<br/>
I also agree with Randy about the way land managers are going to look <br/>
at letterboxing and geocaching. To them, it doesn't matter what you <br/>
put in the little containers you hide, only that you're hiding them <br/>
on the lands that they are responsible for overseeing.<br/>
<br/>
One more point in defense of geocachers I'd like to make is that far <br/>
from being oblivious to these issues, many of them are prone to <br/>
talking them to death. If you would like to get in on discussions <br/>
about how to deal with the issues of environmental impact, dealing <br/>
with land agencies, getting permission to hide containers, how to <br/>
deal with the degenerates within your group, how to combat <br/>
misperceptions about your activity, whether or not to organize, and <br/>
all of the other issues that infrequently pop up on this mailing <br/>
list, you only have to go to the forums at <br/>
http://opentopic.groundspeak.com/ or check out the usenet group <br/>
alt.rec.geocaching for thousands of posts on these subjects. <br/>
Geocachers are not that different from letterboxers, there just <br/>
happen to be so many more of them that they attract the attention of <br/>
the land managers first.<br/>
