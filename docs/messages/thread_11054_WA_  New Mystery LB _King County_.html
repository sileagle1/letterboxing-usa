Note:  visit during July or August for a 'berry' sweet treat; <br/>
however, it's a nice place any time of the year--especially for <br/>
children.  Don't forget to look for Bald Eagles while you're there, <br/>
too!<br/>
<br/>
CLUE:  There is something very special about Pacific Northwest <br/>
blueberries.  So much so, that our finned friend just HAD to get a <br/>
taste of them for himself.  One gorgeous, sunny Pacific Northwest <br/>
day, while surfing the ferries' wakes in the Strait of San Juan de <br/>
Fuca as they crossed from British Columbia to the US, our friend <br/>
overheard ferry passengers talking about this U-Pick blueberry farm <br/>
near a slough over by Ole' Man Winter's house on the Eastside.  <br/>
Apparently, according to the passengers, the blueberries there are <br/>
close to Heaven on Earth!  Well, he hadn't the foggiest idea what or <br/>
where they were talking about since he was of the finned type, but <br/>
he just KNEW he had to try those berries.  So our little mammalian <br/>
friend followed his nose in search of those berries.  <br/>
<br/>
     He swam into Puget Sound, past Discovery Park's bright shining <br/>
light at West Point.  He ventured into those famous Locks (boy, he <br/>
sure missed the bagels &amp; cream cheese there) but his smell was now <br/>
honing in on blueberries these days.  He found himself in Lake Union <br/>
and then Lake Washington's Ship Canal.  He was starting to grow <br/>
weary and quite hungry at this point.  Boy, were thos berries <br/>
smelling better &amp; better all the time!  He next found himself in <br/>
Lake Washington heading Southeast around Mercer Island.  The berry <br/>
scent was drawing him closer and closer to Enatai Beach.  He found <br/>
the beach but no berries.  He then swam under the bridge nearby and <br/>
continued Northeast up into a slough.  Wow!  What an adventure--he's <br/>
never been in a slough before!  Then, he continued swimming through <br/>
the slough's canoe trail and eventually found himself under a large <br/>
footbridge not terribly far from the blueberry fields.  He quickly <br/>
swam up onto a nearby floating deck/dock (he wasn't quite sure what <br/>
it was called) not too far South of the bridge.<br/>
<br/>
That blueberry smell was incredible!  From the dock, he flopped up <br/>
the ramp.  At this point, he was terribly weary and needed to take a <br/>
rest for a bit.  The blueberries, however, were still a bit further <br/>
away to the left of his seat.  He was SOOOOOOO hungry now!!!  He <br/>
gathered all of the strength that he could and managed to flop <br/>
across 7-8 planks.  Then, POOF!!!, the sweet smell of berries <br/>
overcame him!!!  He slipped and squished right down between the <br/>
planks and landed on a middle-ledge on the Southern side.  But, <br/>
alas, he wasn't too disappointed anymore, for lo &amp; behold, right <br/>
there on that ledge happened to be a pint full of the sweetest, <br/>
plumpest, bluest berries that he ever saw (which was a first for <br/>
him).  He thinks some of the local critters (coyotes, beavers or <br/>
muskrats) must have brought them by.  He devoured them with glee and <br/>
yes, he definitely agrees that they are Heaven on Earth (or in the <br/>
sea for him)!  He remains there to this day waiting for more <br/>
blueberries to drop by...<br/>
