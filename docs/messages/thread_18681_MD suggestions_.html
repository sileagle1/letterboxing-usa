<br/>
I was in Maryland on business last month &amp; my husband joined me for a weekend of letterboxing.  He filed a report on our finds (and misses).  You can go to the message archive and search for message #40061 to get the full list (35 found and a bunch of "not found")<br/>
<br/>
Since you mentioned Laurel &amp; Columbia specifically, I'd recommend the Supplee Lane Series, Stanley's Surprise and Turtle's Gift.  I wouldn't recommend the Riverfront Park series since the trail area has been cleared in places and most boxes seem to be missing and/or in areas that are now posted as private property.<br/>
<br/>
Another recommendation would be Scot's Cove and Rocky Gorge sereis.  They are both in the same area so you can hunt for them simultaneously.  2 of the boxes are actually very near each other.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

&gt; I am going to be in Laurel and Columbia, MD for a few days next <br/>
&gt; week <br/>
&gt; for work. I noticed several listings in Columbia and a few in <br/>
&gt; Laurel <br/>
&gt; but I will only have a short period of time for 'boxing in the <br/>
&gt; evening.  Any suggestions?  <br/>

If you're looking for bang for your buck, I'd like to suggest <br/>
"Turtle's Gift to Stanley"  "Stanley's Surprise" and "Centenniel Lake".  <br/>
They're all very close together (last I checked, #2 of Stanley's Surprise <br/>
was missing).  Lots of fun.  They are in Columbia and were MY first LB's.<br/>
<br/>
I've planned to go looking for the Laurel letterboxes for some time <br/>
but haven't actually gotten out there.  If you'd like to take a chance on a <br/>
complete stranger off the internet as a trail buddy, we could try for them <br/>
together.. Don't know when you're actually here and whether<br/>
 I'd be free (mom of three.. I do a lot of driving to activities) but it could be fun.<br/>
<br/>
Please email me offlist if you'd like to try meeting in some very public place<br/>
and heading off to the trail. (werewulfmom at hotmail dot com)<br/>

Well I finally got to meet another letterboxer on the trail!<br/>
Trish and I met on a lovely hot Maryland day and found all <br/>
the boxes in the Supplee Lane at Rocky Gorge series.  It <br/>
was fun and I had a good time looking though her book at <br/>
all the fabulous stamps she'd collected.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Trish for the experience!!  I had a GREAT time!<br/>
