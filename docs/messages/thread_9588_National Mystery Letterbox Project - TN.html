Interstate 65 runs North-South through Nashville.  In the downtown area<br/>
there are several interchanges and the exit numbers are somewhat misleading.<br/>
I think that area is actually numbered based off I-40.  These instructions<br/>
assume you have worked your way through the chaos and are on the section of<br/>
I-65 south of Nashville.  Take exit 78, Harding Place.  Head east using an<br/>
enormous American flag as a landmark.  Pass this.  At the first street light<br/>
(Franklin Road) the name of the street you are on will change to Battery<br/>
Lane.  Follow this street 1.7 miles to Granny White Parkway (there is a<br/>
street light).  Turn right.  There is a very large building dedicated to the<br/>
Girl Scouts here you can use to know you are on the right path.  Follow<br/>
Granny White 1.8 miles and turn left on Clifton (no light, but you really<br/>
can't miss the statue).  There is an immediate right turn into the parking<br/>
lot of the Battle of Nashville Memorial.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After taking a moment to read the beautiful tributes on the memorial take<br/>
notice of the tree line separating it from the neighborhood.  From the edge<br/>
of the fence behind the statue (the other edge is near the main road) head<br/>
toward the tree line.  The first leg will be 57 heel-toe steps of my size 8<br/>
boots headed toward a large tree.  It kind of stands out as being the<br/>
closest one to the treeline while still in the grassy area and the largest<br/>
one in that area.  You really don't even need to count paces.  From the<br/>
tree, the treeline straight ahead (keeping alignment with the fence edge) is<br/>
20 of my heel-toe steps.  Just inside the tree line is a mound of dirt that<br/>
looks something like a fresh grave.  At the right edge of this mound is our<br/>
small pile of rocks with the Tennessee National Letterbox Project stamp<br/>
inside.<br/>

War seems to be the order of business for this planting today.  I was in<br/>
Nashville for my National Guard duty where we are dealing with our current<br/>
war.  Saddam Hussein issued an apology to Kuwait for the last war.  It is<br/>
the anniversary of Pearl Harbor.  The box was planted at a Civil War site<br/>
established by families of soldiers who died in World War 1.  I am glad this<br/>
national project exists to show that the freedom fought for so many times<br/>
still works.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Located and stamped into the National Mystery Letterbox Project - TN this last Sunday afternoon. What an amazing stamp! We had to do a little maintenance on the box...water had seeped in, and the journal was just a little damp. We dried it out, put everything into fresh ziploc bags, and sealed it up tightly before replacing it. I only wish we could have let the journal airdry a bit more before packing it back up. Hope it won't mildew! This seems to be a well-visited box...people from all over the country have stamped in!<br/>
