Just jumped out of bed ... jumped in the shower ... started to get <br/>
dressed ... and then something outside my window caught my eye ... <br/>
SNOW!!!!!!  Well I am pleased to say that I have just extended my <br/>
Thanksgiving Vacation by one whole day and I am going to make the <br/>
most of it.  I am already up ... there is no point in going back to <br/>
bed! :)  So I'm off to letterbox in North-Western Connecticut on <br/>
wonderful trails done up in their finest winter garb.  Hope to meet <br/>
people up there. (wink wink nudge nudge)<br/>

p.s. - I'm going to hit Berlin, Burlington, Bethlehem, Harwinton, <br/>
Litchfield, and Torrington ... to name a few.    :)<br/>

And, no, I'm not going to tell you how old I am!  Too bad I can't go out boxing today Alan... would have liked to see you again on the trails!  I have to clean the house for Thanksgiving dinner.  However, I'm going letterboxing on Friday and if you haven't gone and done the 21 musical boxes in Mansfield yet, I could use a buddy to go with :-)  I don't want to be out there on my own, and fall off a cliff....
<br/>
<br/>Happy Boxing!
