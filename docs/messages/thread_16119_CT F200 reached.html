I have been boxing about a year now and I want to thank all you <br/>
wonderful people for carving such beautiful stamps and hiding them <br/>
in such nice out of the way parks and fun places to visit.  I would <br/>
not know of these nice places otherwise.  I hope to see many of you <br/>
at the DEP gathering Saturday and get more X's.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing to all and to all a good F, P, A, X, HH, D, Z, W, L, <br/>
and all the letters you use. ;-)<br/>
