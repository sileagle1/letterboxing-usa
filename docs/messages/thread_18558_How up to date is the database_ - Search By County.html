&gt; Some letterbox-placers, myself included, add a "verified" note to <br/>

&gt; What isn't up to date, tho - and I've so far protested in vain - <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; the shading-in of counties where the boxes are located.  When I'm <br/>
&gt; planning an auto trip, I like to examine the states involved to <br/>
see <br/>
&gt; where letterboxes may lie along the route.  Few of us know the <br/>
&gt; location of counties other than in our home state, so it can be <br/>
&gt; difficult to zero in on the readily available boxes when this info <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; incomplete.<br/>
&gt; Anyone else think this is important?  I'd volunteer (again)to lend <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; hand in this task, if it were possible to parcel the work out.<br/>

I agree that being able to search by county would be nice.  The<br/>
graphic of the state is divided up by region, so even if that<br/>
was correct it would still be a large area.  I would love to<br/>
see County added as a search criteria on the Search For Boxes<br/>
page, if that is possible and not too much trouble.<br/>
