Seattle and see when they could make a gathering in the SLO area.  I think<br/>
the SLO area is a grand idea for a gather.  Now if you all plan it in<br/>
September as Sir Balthazar said I will probably already be relocated to<br/>
Portland.  However if you plan it in October or later I would be inclined to<br/>
come back and visit just to go and letterbox with my dear friends of<br/>

I would like to come to any gathering. I am in San Diego and would love <br/>
another excuse to go to Kernville and or San Francisco. SF is just about <br/>
doable in a w/e if I have the Friday off work. It would help to know camp <br/>
grounds in the area in advance.<br/>
<br/>
The last time we went to Kernville, we were birdwatching and camping by the <br/>
river and did not manage to do any lbs.<br/>
<br/>
We have just had a w/e in SLO and it's a favourite of mine, we were only <br/>
able to do 3 lb so there are many more for us to do!<br/>
<br/>
The furthest I have travelled to a geocaching gathering was Monterey!! That <br/>
was great fun.<br/>
<br/>
We would be willing to give a ride to Cadenza(or 1 or 2 others) if dates and <br/>
times work out!<br/>
