This box is located near Salmen Scout Reservation, also known as Camp<br/>
V-Bar.  Some people also call this Camp Salmen, but this is<br/>
technically incorrect, as Camp Salmen was the old Camp located near<br/>
Slidell, LA.   Please note that you will NOT need to enter the camp<br/>
property to locate the box.  Scouts are reminded to talk with their<br/>
leaders before seeking the box since they will need to LEAVE the camp.<br/>
