                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know which box you refer to ... and it was in suprisingly great<br/>
condition when found in late July.  No real evidence of being<br/>
underwater.  A testament, perhaps, to the carefulness of the box<br/>
placer and subsequent finders to make sure that everything was<br/>
properly sealed.<br/>
