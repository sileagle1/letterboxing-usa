Just wanted to let you know that the Bluffs Box (one of the Moose Hill <br/>
letterbox series) was found by a hiker and turned in at the Nature Center. I <br/>
work at the Sanctuary and am a letterboxer. I will re-mark the box "Not trash <br/>
- please put back where you found me" and return it to its hiding spot. It <br/>
may be a week or two before I get a chance to get it out there, and I will <br/>
post when I do, since I'm usually either teaching classes or trapped at my <br/>
computer at work.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the Moose Hill box is truly missing...I think the dutiful people who <br/>
work at that specific, particular spot cleaned up the area and happened upon <br/>
it. It was not the Sanctuary staff, since we like letterboxes :)<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
