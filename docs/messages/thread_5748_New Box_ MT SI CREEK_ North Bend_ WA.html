I wanted to place one at the summit, but there were just too many people <br/>
there. This is one of the most popular conditioning trails in the <br/>
Northern Cascades, so be careful when finding/replacing boxes.  Other <br/>
cautions:  Both bears and cougars have been sighted on Si. If you stay <br/>
on the trails, though, they're so heavily traveled that you should be fine.<br/>
<br/>
This is on a spur trail from the first Mt. Si Trail box.  You can get <br/>
them both at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
To get to Si:  Take I-90 East from Seattle to exit 32.  Turn left over <br/>
the overpass, then left again where the road T's.  Take a right on Mt. <br/>
Si Road, over a bridge, and veering slightly right.  Follow the road for <br/>
2.5 miles, and the enterance to the park is on your left, in some trees. <br/>
  The trailhead is marked, near the rest rooms.<br/>
<br/>
TO FIND THE BOX:<br/>
Half-way up, through the snag flats, there is a place where the trail <br/>
diverges.  Take the Creek path.<br/>
<br/>
Go across the small wooden bridge and up the small hill.  It turns <br/>
right, next to the roots of a downed tree.<br/>
<br/>
 From the turn, take approximately five-six steps.<br/>
<br/>
On your right will be two trees, one larger than the other in diameter. <br/>
  Immediately to your left, maybe one more step, is a pile of rocks on <br/>
the ground.  The box is there, under the grey rock with moss on half of <br/>
it, under some piled bark and evergreen.<br/>
<br/>
If you go on to summit Si, be careful to bring enough water -- I ran out <br/>
half-way up, and if it wasn't for a good samaritan near the top, I would <br/>
have been hard-pressed to get out of there un-dehydrated.  (Not that <br/>
water isn't a hiking basic, but it bears repeating.)<br/>
<br/>
I have some pictures of the top here:<br/>

How long did it take you to climb the whole way up?<br/>
<br/>
I assume it's faster coming down... (:<br/>
