                    <div class="plaintext-content">The weather was just a little tooo nice this weekend...  I printed out<br/>
Cara's clues in Oxbow Park and threw a bag full of stamps &amp; inkpads into<br/>
the truck (my compass and stampbook are ALWAYS in the truck).  Brian<br/>
decided to forego a morning of Pokemon to join me.<br/>
<br/>
We live west of Portland, behind the West Hills.  As such, we miss a lot<br/>
of the cold wind that blows out of the Gorge.  When we got within 5<br/>
miles of the mouth of the Gorge the wind was HOWLING.  Fortunately Oxbow<br/>
Park sets back into the foothills of the Cascades enough to provide some<br/>
shelter.<br/>
<br/>
The trail to Oxbow #1 runs right along and above the Sandy River.  We<br/>
have seen salmon spawning on past trips to this park, but none today.  A<br/>
few Steelhead fishermen were working the gravel bars and we waved to 2<br/>
different drift boats as they floated by.  It was brisk out, but dry. <br/>
We did some rockhounding along the bank of the river, but not much to<br/>
find and keep, just tumbled basalt and volcanic stone urped from Mt.<br/>
Hood.  We puzzled over the clues a little.... but were successful in the<br/>
end and stamped up on a damp log nearby!!<br/>
<br/>
We got near box #2, but impending birthday party commitments made us<br/>
abandon the search for another day!<br/>
<br/>
Question to Cara.... box 2 begins with instructions to start on trail <br/>
"D" on the RIGHT side of the road.  Does this mean the right side of the<br/>
road as you drive IN to the Park or the right side as you drive back<br/>
from the amphitheatre??  We assumed the latter &amp; the first clue or two<br/>
seemed to support that decision.... however, we couldn't find the long<br/>
downed log nor the wood &amp; rope handrail.  HELP!!<br/>
<br/>
letterboxing... alive in Oregon!!!!<br/>
