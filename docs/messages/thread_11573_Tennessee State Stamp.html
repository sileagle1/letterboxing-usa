Directions: On RT 97 (Pudding Hill RD.)in Scotland it will be the same<br/>
starting point as the Rock Springs Wildlife Refuge Letterboxes.If you<br/>
are on 97 heading south it will be on the left side of the road it will<br/>
be just a small parking area with a small sign stating Rock Springs<br/>
Wildlife Refuge.On 97 heading North it will be on the right a little<br/>
ways down the road from the James V. Spignesi Wildlife Management Area.<br/>
Pull in and park,enter the trail and you will come to a bulletin board<br/>
as soon as you go past it there will be a trail on the left.(You need to<br/>
take this trail to do our Tennessee Letterbox or you can go straight and<br/>
do the Rock Springs Wildlife Refuge letterboxes first and you can hook<br/>
up with our box towards the end at the promising views.But if your here<br/>
just to do the Tennesse box then take the left,right past the bulletin<br/>
board.) Go in a ways and you will be walking along a stone wall keep on<br/>
the trail and follow the white dots.you will soon pass through a stone<br/>
wall continue on and you will cross a small stream.And then you will<br/>
come to another stream bed and cross it to,you'll be heading down hill<br/>
for awhile twisting and turning and then yet another stream keep going<br/>
and soon you will come to a T with a much wider trail.Take a left and<br/>
head up the hill,when you get to the top you will come to a fork in the<br/>
trail.Take the smaller trail on the right marked in yellow and white<br/>
dots.You will soon pass through a stone wall and then you will come to<br/>
another stream keep following the dots and there will be another small<br/>
stream.Cross over and you will start going up hill and you will pass<br/>
through another STONE WALL keep going up some more and you will come to<br/>
a clearing that has THE MOST PROMISING VIEW.There will be a bench made<br/>
out of stone for you to sit and look at the beautiful view.You need to<br/>
sit on the bench,now stand and go straight 6 paces and stop take a<br/>
reading of due North and there will be a faint path near the edge that<br/>
leads to a stone wall.(DO NOT TAKE THE BIG PATH BEHIND THE BENCH) Make<br/>
your way to the stone wall.Now walk down the wall a little and you will<br/>
come to a small tree and there will be a break in the wall just<br/>
after.From the break keep going 5 paces and their will be a skinny<br/>
little tree in the wall near that skinny tree behind a stone door is the<br/>
Tennessee Letterbox.To return follow the trail back the way you came<br/>
until you get to the wider trail,go down the hill a ways and there will<br/>
be a trail on your left with a sign that says over look.Keep going down<br/>
the wide trail 13 paces and there will be a trail on the right with a<br/>
tree with a white dot and a tree near a stone wall that says<br/>
Entrance.take that trail back to your car.The NeeDeeps      <br/>
