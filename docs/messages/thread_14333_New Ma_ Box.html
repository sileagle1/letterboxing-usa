Quabbin Reservoir, Gate 16, Shutesbury Ma.<br/>
<br/>
*  Note: There is no actual gate or sign.<br/>
<br/>
The Quabbin Reservoir was created in 1939 in the evacuated Swift River <br/>
Valley, in order to provide a supply of water for the city of Boston. The <br/>
construction of the Quabbin required the building of two dams and the <br/>
destruction of the towns of Prescott, Dana, Enfield, and Greenwich. By 1946, <br/>
the reservoir was filled, creating one of the largest bodies of untreated <br/>
drinking water in the world. The reservation also serves as a wildlife <br/>
sanctuary and offers numerous hiking trails on the nearly 40,000 acres that <br/>
are open to the public. It is one of my favorite places to go hiking and <br/>
fishing.<br/>
