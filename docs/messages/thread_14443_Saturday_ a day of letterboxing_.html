We went to Seattle on business and decided to bring the letterboxing supplies with us, yust in case. (Grin)  Well, to make a short story long, the thing we were there to do did not pan out, so we were free at 9:00am to go in search of letterboxes!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
We started at Carkeek Park, searching for Candlelight's Carkeek Park Series.  The weather was beautiful, the place quiet and the bird singing. We started off in the lower part of the park, searching for The Unicorn Letterbox, and bingo, discovered it!  First find of the day.<br/>
Next comes The Pixie Witch and there she was, doing just fine! Score two for the day.<br/>
However, bad news, The Sand Castle is no more. We found the location, and the hollow is there, things had been moved aside as if there was a letterbox there at one time, alas, it is MIA. Bummer.  :-(<br/>
<br/>
Next, we headed up the road to the top of the park, looking for the Carkeek Salmon Series.<br/>
Off we go, searching for the IDA box and, after finally tearing ourselves away from the beautiful vista that was seen from the beach, off we went to discover is in fine shape! Score three for the day.<br/>
Continuing on, we wandered around, following the clues and watching the beautiful views, we came across the King Salmon box! Score four for the day.  And in this box, to our wonderment was a second stamp. I at first thought, having read something in the clues about a multi colored stamp, that this was it, but NO! It was our First Hitchhiker! We discovered, in the King Salmon box, the Lost Hitchhiker Box, from Nebraska! She's doing fine and is with us now, being cleaned and stamped and then will be sent off on her way. Score five for the day.<br/>
Continuing one we followed the clues to the Salmon Run box and discovered it alive and well. Score six for the day.<br/>
<br/>
Departing Carkeek Park and stopping at Dick's for lunch (What a treat!) we headed over to Lincoln Park.<br/>
Following the clues of the Seattle Muddle Puddle Trotters, we discovered the Clover Box, however, he's not feeling well. The box was wet inside, we took everything apart, cleaned and dried as best we could. Stamped in and put everything back in place after cleaning and drying the box as well. Also to note, the stamp for this one is broke in 1/2. Score seven for the day.<br/>
Moving on we found The Stump Box doing well, very clean and dry, stamped in and re-hid it. Score eight for the day.<br/>
Searching for the last box was a heck of a hike and, alas, for nought, it also is missing in action. We discovered the logs as indicated in the clues, following the necessary path to the forked mossy tree, however, in the hollow, no box could be found. Bummer!<br/>
<br/>
Returning to the BLuf trail, we followed the clues for Amanda of Seattle's Lincoln Park Letter Boxes.  Coming out of a trail, we settled on a bench and started reading clue to familiarize ourselves with where we needed to go... After resting awhile, we got ready to move when Kris asked if the clues said something about a bench with a plaque. I said yes and she pointed at our feet were the plaque mentioned in the clues lay.  Reading the clues again, for the Vashon Ferry Box, I looked over to the right and there was the tree!!!  It took me a few minutes to find the box though as Amanda has hidden it reather cleverly!  Score nine for the day.<br/>
Moving down the trail, we went after the Lincoln Park Box. After a good trek, we discovered him alive and well. Score ten for the day.<br/>
<br/>
Since we had found ten boxes today, we decided to head home with one stop... In SeaTac to try and finish the Flight Path letterboxes of Amanda from Seattle's. WE were able to return, armed with a clue or two from Amanda herself and were victorious in finally finding the Northwest Airlines box and the beautiful, awesome Alaska Airlines box. Score eleven and twelve.<br/>
<br/>
With that, we headed home to soak weary feet and relax, happy of a very, very successful day!<br/>
