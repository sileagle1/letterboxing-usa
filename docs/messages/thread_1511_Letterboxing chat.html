&gt;I'll chat, but I don't feel like downloading another client when<br/>
&gt;e-groups, yahoo, and others already have chat set up.<br/>

Perhaps a little background might persuade you or some others to <br/>
consider jabber. Historically AOL, Yahoo, MSN and the other big <br/>
players have tried to gain a captive audience for their advertising <br/>
by (among many other things) creating instant messaging clients that <br/>
do not play well with each other. This is similar to what e-groups <br/>
does with lists such as this to get an advertising audience. Jabber <br/>
is an opensource server (meaning no one owns it or controls it) that <br/>
anyone with a linux server (and a little patience) can setup. All the <br/>
users need is a instant messaging client. Jabber clients are free and <br/>
simple to setup (not to mention don't require disclosing personal <br/>
info for advertising databases).  I can also (with a little more <br/>
patience) setup jabber so that you can continue to communicate with <br/>
anyone using AOL, or MSN instant messaging clients (which is <br/>
generally not possible using one of their servers because they don't <br/>
like you to be able to do that). When I do that you could chat with <br/>
me on my jabber server using your current AOL,  or MSN instant <br/>
messaging client ( I think that Yahoo is not ready yet). However, I <br/>
do _not_ think that AOL, Yahoo, or MSN clients are able to <br/>
participate in group chats hosted by a jabber server (though I am <br/>
investigating whether this is accurate).<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in finding out more about it try <br/>
http://www.jabber.com , or for more technical info try <br/>
http://www.jabbercentral.com . For the real computer geeks (yikes I <br/>
guess that means me!) http://www.jabber.org gives info for people <br/>
wanting to run a jabber server.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to download a jabber instant messaging client to try <br/>
it out, for Windows I suggest WinJab at:<br/>
http://winjab.sourceforge.net/<br/>
For Macintosh I suggest:<br/>
http://jabbernaut.sourceforge.net/<br/>
<br/>
I have setup a letterboxing jabber server who's address is:<br/>
<br/>
jabber.letterboxing.com<br/>
<br/>
and to create/join groupchats it is:<br/>
<br/>
conference.letterboxing.com<br/>
<br/>
Anyone contact me directly if you download a client and I can help <br/>
you get it setup very easily. If there is enough interest I will post <br/>
public instructions. We can setup a letterboxing groupchat next week <br/>
after the holidays if people want to try it out.<br/>

I was referring to http://www.egroups.com/chat/letterbox-usa, which<br/>
anyone on the list with a java-enabled browser (most modern browers are)<br/>
can use for chat without having to download and install more software.<br/>
(I'm not sure if the above url works directly, but you can drill down <br/>
to it from your egroups home page).  We've had letterboxing chat using<br/>
this facility before.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to get into a weenie war as to which chat application, (etc)<br/>
is better :-)  I fear such might be a bit off-topic for the list.  I was <br/>
referring to the e-groups chat as a possible common denominator that is <br/>
quick and easy for everyone.  If people want to schedule regular (or <br/>
ad hoc) letterboxing chat, choose the time and the software (if they <br/>
don't like e-groups or other already set up ones), and if I can make <br/>
it and feel like dealing with the software, I'll be there.  If everyone <br/>
else is using the jabber software, fine.<br/>
<br/>
[Like I said, I work in the internet business so I understand some of<br/>
the issues you brought up.  I block banner ads and e-group ads at my<br/>
linux server so that is not an issue for me.  I'm not a Luddite, only a <br/>
letterboxing Luddite :-)]<br/>

Ok now you have used that word several times and I am suffering a <br/>
bout of ignorance. In great fear that I might suffer from Ludditism <br/>
without knowing it, I consulted my old Websters and it is no where to <br/>
be found. Is it treatable? Are there different strains of Luddite <br/>
which are more serious than others? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
More seriously, I can probably setup a webpage interface to <br/>
letterboxing chat I was suggesting. There is one available for jabber <br/>
but I am not sure the bugs are worked out yet. After the holiday I <br/>
will offer up the opportunity and anyone cares to join will be <br/>
welcome. Hopefully you might decided to participate. Later.<br/>
