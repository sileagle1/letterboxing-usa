scheduled for 6:30 PM tonight. They will hope to have another soon. <br/>
They are still a great source for MasterCarve "Carves like butter."<br/>
<br/>
I am dropping off a flyer for our October 4th event with the owner <br/>
tonight. Not sure that flyers are a good idea but since they are <br/>
helping sponsor the raffle, I figured why not? <br/>
<br/>
And yes, JugglerMouse, the flyer does say that one of the events will <br/>
be cheese racing. That does not mean that there WILL be cheese racing <br/>
(especially if there are children there). <br/>
<br/>
Oh, the humanity!<br/>

that hasn't made it this far east?  An inside joke?  Some really <br/>
cool, slightly naughty activity that we behind-the-times hillbillies <br/>
here in Appalachia haven't discovered yet?  The mind boggles with <br/>
possibilities.  Waiting to find out with bated breath...<br/>
