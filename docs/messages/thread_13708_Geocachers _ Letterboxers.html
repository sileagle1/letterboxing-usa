Can I offer a positive note on this subject?  I went searching for a <br/>
letterbox last week, and most of the journal entries were along the <br/>
lines of "I was searching for xyz geocache and discovered this <br/>
letterbox by mistake".  The geocachers were kind enough to log in and <br/>
rehide the box very well.  When I found the box, I logged in and <br/>
rehid it.  Although curious about the geocache that was apparently <br/>
just a few degrees bearing off from this letterbox, I did not go <br/>
scrambling around to find it.  Why?  I don't geocache, I don't have <br/>
the equipment.  The geocachers respected the letterbox, and I, as a <br/>
letterboxer, respected the geocache.<br/>
<br/>
See?  Sometimes we actually can all get along :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been letterboxing and geocaching for about a year and a half. <br/>
I enjoy both. Letterboxing appeals to my artistic and literary <br/>
interests and I like the fact that you don't need any special <br/>
equipment to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Geocaching, on the other hand, appeals to my technical interests. I <br/>
love computers and shortwave radio and GPS and all the neat things <br/>
that you can do with them.<br/>
<br/>
Both hobbies appeal to my lifelong interest in maps and navigation. <br/>
Also, like all kids (young or old) I love a treasure hunt.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that it may be human nature to put down someone else's <br/>
hobby, in fact I have done it myself at times, but I would hope that <br/>
most letterboxers don't despise geocachers.<br/>
<br/>
And I DO know how to use my compass though that pesky Compass <br/>
Letterbox in Westfield MA still eludes me! <br/>

When we took the kids out to South Dakota,   there were very few letterboxes <br/>
we could search for but TEAM FAMILY AFFAIR hid some very awesome and <br/>
worthwhile geocaches.  Our favorite of which was the Presidential View box...which was <br/>
very true to its name.<br/>
<br/>
Of course we did hide a few combination boxes while we were out there.<br/>
<br/>
There are all kinds of people.  I've had "run-ins" with a few geocachers in <br/>
the St.Louis area that considered my letterboxes to be "trash".  TO each his <br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun<br/>
