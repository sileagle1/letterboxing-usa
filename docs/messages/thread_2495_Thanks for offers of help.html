    Our group has always sought to keep the site strictly in the<br/>
non-profit mode.  That is why the patches and decals are handled by a<br/>
volunteer.  That is why we do not publish clue books for a fee.  That is<br/>
why we do not have an entrance fee or registration.  It is why we do not<br/>
sell our list.   It is also why we have been self-funded and jointly<br/>
funded, although some individuals have certainly carried a heavier<br/>
financial burden than others.  Also, some have carried  significant<br/>
creative and/or technical burdens.<br/>
<br/>
    I have endeavored to be a peacemaker.  Sometimes this has worked<br/>
more smoothly than at other times.  I do not feel I can post the names<br/>
of the Webmasters, current or former, but perhaps some of them will<br/>
choose to identify themselves.  You must realize that not everyone<br/>
wishes to expose themselves to the comments of the group.  Praise can be<br/>
scant at times, criticism can be barbed.  Let us all strive to keep<br/>
discussions in the civil mode.<br/>

I am on the webmaster list.  My name is Thom Cheney.  I got started in<br/>
letterboxing in 1998.  At the time it was pretty scant offerings.  I planted<br/>
a box here in Oregon and wondered if anyone would ever show up and find it.<br/>
I have been through all the ins &amp; outs of this list as it has evolved.  When<br/>
Eric Mings was moderating the original list, I supported his idea of<br/>
commercializing the list to help offset his costs.  The group decided<br/>
otherwise and split off to form a new letterboxing list.  I followed that<br/>
group and have since embraced the idea that this group should be<br/>
non-commercial.  When it evolved to the current state, I asked to be a<br/>
member of the webmaster list.  I am a graphic artist by trade, but web-work<br/>
is not my deal.  I am allowed to monitor the list and participate in<br/>
discussion.  Since I don't provide ANY of the clue maintenance or web<br/>
design, I abstain from voting on any procedural or design related decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Before any more ludicrous discussion of a "secret society" persists, let me<br/>
assure you all that the webmaster list exists to handle the housekeeping<br/>
chores and nothing else.  There is no secret agenda and these VOLUNTEERS<br/>
certainly don't spend their days at the computer calling anyone names.<br/>
Shame on those who would suggest otherwise.<br/>
