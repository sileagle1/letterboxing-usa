enjoyed perusing his log book and checking out all the letterboxes in <br/>
the North East that I want to try to find.<br/>
<br/>
And it was also great fun to meet with some of the other folks here <br/>
in the Pacific Northwest (although I was the only representative from <br/>
Washington State).  Always nice to be able to place a face on that <br/>
cryptic call sign. :-)<br/>
<br/>
And I got to add an Exchange Count to my stats!  Hurrah!<br/>
Let's don't be strangers!  I'm looking forward to a possible Spring <br/>
Gathering!!<br/>
