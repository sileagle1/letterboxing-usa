for our Madeleine. In the French (Montreal) version the name is <br/>
spelled Madeleine. <br/>
I do feel I have condemned her to a life of hearing her name <br/>
mispronouced and having to spell it out at every turn.<br/>
We meant well...<br/>

&gt; dime store goodie with her name on it...  Poor thing!  Critical <br/>

&gt; neglects to consider when naming one's child...&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I named my daughter 'Chandler' which has been worsened by naming <br/>
her older and younger brothers Jake and Ben.  At 5 going on 20, she <br/>
is very aware of how many things DON'T say Chandler.  I can be a <br/>
small comfort since I am an 'Esther' and the only thing I ever saw <br/>
with my name on it was a fat little spoon-holding woman smashed flat <br/>
(for easier hanging) that said, "Esther's Kitchen" across her apron.  <br/>
I hate cooking.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She says that since I knew of the name problem already, I should <br/>
have named her 'Sarah' and she could have her name on a pencil.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Madeleine and Chandler can both take heart in the wonderful world <br/>
of mail-order and on-line merchandise where one can-for an additional <br/>
$3.95-have their name put on darn near anything.  You should get her <br/>
one of those custom books that features her name as the main <br/>
character!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay, that got off-topic.<br/>
