for Ladybug and Jolly G-Man.<br/>
New Orleans, LA<br/>
(Orleans Parish)<br/>
<br/>
Prior to seeking this box, you must locate a Louisiana Quarter Dollar.<br/>
 You will need to gather information regarding the historic event<br/>
referenced on the reverse of the coin.<br/>
<br/>
Step 1.		Get a quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Step 2.		Go to the Quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Step 3.  	Find the building where documents related to this even were<br/>
signed.  This building is called The <br/>
<br/>
___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___.<br/>
<br/>
Step 4.		Find the building next door.  This building is known as <br/>
___  ___  ___  ___  ___     ___  ___  ___  ___  ___     <br/>
<br/>
___  ___  ___  ___ ___  ___  ___  ___  ___.<br/>
<br/>
Step 5.		Find the nearby statue depicts Andrew Jackson holding his <br/>
<br/>
___  ___  ___ <br/>
in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
Step 6.  	Travel towards the direction where the man in number 5 fought<br/>
the British.  Stay on Charters until you reach Esplanade.<br/>
<br/>
Step 7.  	Find the ?plant? where a similar object from Step 1 could have<br/>
come from in earlier times.  This place is known as a <br/>
<br/>
___  ___  ___  ___.  <br/>
The letter ?O? was their mark.<br/>
<br/>
Step 8.		Travel away from the water that drained the subject on the quarter.  <br/>
<br/>
Step 9.		You will eventually reach another body of water known as <br/>
<br/>
___  ___  ___  ___ ___  Saint ___  ___  ___  ___.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Step 10.	The larger than life man you see is P. G. T. <br/>
<br/>
___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___ ___  ___  ___  ___.<br/>
<br/>
Step 11.	Go to the nearby place that has or had (depending on when you go<br/>
on this expedition) a display related to the event which is referenced<br/>
on the coin.  This building was originally named for Isaac <br/>
<br/>
___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___.<br/>
<br/>
Step 12.	Return to Pierre Gustave and travel in the general direction<br/>
indicated by the 3rd letter you filled in during Step 7.  Continue<br/>
until you reach a street named for a president whose name begins with<br/>
the first letter you filled in during Step 5.<br/>
<br/>
Step 13.	Travel on this road in the direction of the neighboring parish<br/>
named for the president who was involved in the event we have been<br/>
speaking of.<br/>
<br/>
Step 14. 	Stop at the Arboretum.  <br/>
<br/>
Step 15.	The location you seek is spelled with the 14th letter in Step 4,<br/>
the 4th letter in Step 3, the 5th letter in Step 3 and the 3rd letter<br/>
in Step 11.  This is located in the Arboretum.<br/>
<br/>
Step 16.	Your goal is at hand.  The general direction Lewis and Clark went<br/>
to explore the land of this event was in the could be indicated by the<br/>
last letter in Step 9 and the opposite direction indicated by the 2nd<br/>
letter in Step 10.  Look under the wood and on a support in this<br/>
corner and you will have completed you quest.<br/>
<br/>
Warning:<br/>
Unfortunately, the criminal element is at large.  I recommend against<br/>
walking the entire route on Esplanade, as it passes through a high<br/>
crime area.  The locations specifically mentioned should be safe to<br/>
visit as these are normal tourist attractions.  If you exercise normal<br/>
precautions, this should be an interesting outing.<br/>
<br/>
Note:<br/>
	It is not necessary to travel the entire route if you know your history<br/>
and landmarks.<br/>
