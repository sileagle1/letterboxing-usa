I have a really cool letterbox and stamp that I tried to get placed at the<br/>
downtown library, but they denied it. I'd love for it to be in a book<br/>
related place downtown to make it easy for out of towners to find it as well<br/>
as people from both sides of the city.<br/>

Try a Local Branch Library.  Downtown Librarys are stuff BUT the About of <br/>
people coming and going I can see their point.  Like our library, The <br/>
Traffic is low and there is almost always the same clerk Unlike Downtown.<br/>
