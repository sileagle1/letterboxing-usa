Has anyone noticed the messages are listed without identifying <br/>
message number's now?  This is going to make it hard to find things <br/>
in the archives.<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed the member list is now ordered by join-up date and not <br/>
alphabetically, all 2462 members.<br/>
<br/>
Any chance of finding a way around these new changes?<br/>

Looks like the message number is up at the top right.  It's odd that <br/>
they've reversed the order of messages--from the most recent always <br/>
appearing at the bottom to now always appearing at the top no matter <br/>
how you're viewing the list.  Hey, it does allow you to search 400 <br/>
messages at a time now--as opposed to the 20 or so previously.  ;)  Of <br/>
course, that bodes both well and not so well for folks...<br/>

I looked through some of the administrative functions and can't find<br/>
anything that would allow me to change these changes.  I have to<br/>
admit, I'm not too happy with the changes.  I used to think anything<br/>
would be an improvement over the Yahoo Groups, but they actually<br/>
managed to make it WORSE!  Astonishing!<br/>
<br/>
The biggest irony--for me, at least--I'd been updating the message<br/>
boards on Atlas Quest to look and feel more like Yahoo Groups, then<br/>
they go and pull this on me.  *rolling eyes*  <br/>
<br/>
I'm most unhappy with the fact that the messages now seem to be listed<br/>
backwards and that when I click on the "Messages" link in the menu,<br/>
it's cluttered up with the first line of each message.  I like just<br/>
seeing the subject titles and not the clutter that's there now. <br/>

Some of us just don't like a bunch of e-mails cluttering up our<br/>
mailbox quota.  And with a dial-up connection, it can take a long,<br/>
long time to download lots of e-mails that you may never end up<br/>
reading.  E-mail also isn't always reliable.  Sometimes they don't<br/>
show up due to a spam catcher, the e-mail account was down for updates<br/>
or maintenance, etc, etc.<br/>

There's lots of reasons to view the list online, but it's not for<br/>
everybody!  I'm half tempted to deal with the e-mail probably just to<br/>
avoid these changes, though.  Ugh!<br/>

Just double check the info. If there's a typo in the from or subject info (or whatever one you chose to use) it won't send the message into that folder. I have folders for a lot of stuff, like pending ebay or stuff I want to keep and drag it into those. Makes the mailbx a much friendly place. <s><br/>

&gt; it's cluttered up with the first line of each<br/>
&gt; message.  I like just<br/>
&gt; seeing the subject titles and not the clutter that's<br/>
&gt; there now. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do the same thing. That's one of my favorite features of Outlook Express. I've got filters set up for most of my regular mail coming in . . . one for each of the Yahoo letterboxing groups, one for my Women of Faith stuff coming in as well as areas set up to put stuff I want to keep or to read later when I have time. I love it . . . it saves tons of time and keeps the clutter to a minimum. <br/>
<br/>
I usually set up my filters so that it matches against the subject line and the message body. If it picks up a match in either place, it automatically sends it to that folder. Also good for setting up filters to auto-delete any mail that comes in with x-rated or offensive words. <br/>
<br/>
And it lets me set up several "accounts", so even though it's coming out of my personal email, I have it set up that the name that appears on it is Letterbug (that is, when I remember to switch it in my emails before I hit send <gg>).<br/>
<br/>
Checking mail online drives me crazy since they all have totally different formats and they all seem so ungodly slow to get through. Just so much easier for me to do all my email "offline" in my own format and at my own speed. :-)<br/>

<br/>
  woo-hoo! Somebody likes my way. LOL <br/>
<br/>
  Just double check the info. If there's a typo in the from or subject info (or whatever one you chose to use) it won't send the message into that folder. I have folders for a lot of stuff, like pending ebay or stuff I want to keep and drag it into those. Makes the mailbx a much friendly place. <s><br/>
