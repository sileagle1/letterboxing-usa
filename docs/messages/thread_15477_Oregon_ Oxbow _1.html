Park in Troutdale Oregon please let me know. It's an unclaimed box - <br/>
looks like it's been there since the 60's. I was out there for hours <br/>
today searching with no luck. I swear I was in the right place too. <br/>
I'm not sure if I was just off-track or if the box is no longer <br/>
there. I found another box in the park (the Riverbend box) and there <br/>
were signatures in there from last year that indicated people had <br/>
found the Oxbow #1 box as well - so maybe I was just looking in the <br/>
wrong place. Any help would be much appreciated. If it's there I'll <br/>
go back and find it. I hate being thwarted  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing!<br/>
