Flagrant Plagarism? So, ripping off the Int'l Artgirls Letterboxing <br/>
Cabal again, are we? No.....but on that most creative list of all <br/>
~Mischief promotes a great idea for a Random Acts of Kindness thing. <br/>

<br/>
Margaret and I are involved with Random Acts of Genealogical Kindness <br/>
(http://www.raogk.org), a group that does free research and <br/>
photographs old cemeteries  and other stuff for others and we have <br/>
loved it. Mischief at IALC gives me an idea for Random Acts of <br/>
Letterboxing Kindness that would be fun for some and would really <br/>
help out the "webmasters." We've talked about it a little and thought <br/>
we'd toss it out to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
What if the technologically adept among us (you know who you are!) <br/>
were to offer to create and host clue pages for the folks that <br/>
couldn't make a web page to save their lives? Perhaps some of the <br/>
members of the letterboxing webring would be willing to post clues <br/>
for other letterboxers on their websites? Then the LbNA pages could <br/>
point to those, instead of creating and maintaining "courtesy pages." <br/>
That would save a mountain of energy for the three people who are <br/>
doing that part of the LbNA workload: we are currently making over <br/>
100 web pages a month for people.<br/>
<br/>
We could start this informally, with people who live near one another <br/>
just contacting each other and volunteering. On a more formal basis, <br/>
I would be glad to create a clearing house site on LbNA (or maybe <br/>
even a yahoogroup) to help organize this effort.<br/>
<br/>
We are still exploring the possibility of changing to a database-<br/>
driven website that would let people fill out a "form" and then <br/>
automatically post and maintain their clues. Anyone who uses <br/>
www.geocaching.com or www.bookcrossing.com knows that the features <br/>
available in that medium are amazing. But for now, how about RAOLK?<br/>

I would be willing to set up personal geocities websites for people <br/>
to maintain.  It is really a piece of cake and it is free for those <br/>
that don't want to be tied to a certain ISP.  Once it is set up even <br/>
the "techno-illiterates" in the group can easily add pages by copying <br/>
the initial page and adding new info.<br/>

I need help with this webpage thing.<br/>
I actually tried to set up my own web page about a month ago, but couldn't figure out how to link my files.  I'm willing to try again.  I need to know every little detail  because I'm computer illiterate.  I do have all my clues in a Word file.  It's the link thing.  Someone lend me a teenager.<br/>
