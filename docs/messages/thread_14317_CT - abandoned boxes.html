                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to Woodchuck who let me know what was going on in the emails. <br/>
I've been on the trail for several years now but I had to stop the <br/>
emails back when SNET merged with Yahoo. After the merge there was no <br/>
way to stop the incoming emails for the summer. They were relentless! <br/>
They continued no matter what I did. Somehow the pref's were tangled <br/>
up and no one could get me out of the problem I found I was in. I <br/>
emailed webmasters and the like. I had first elected to not have <br/>
emails, then I quit, EVEN after quitting I still received emails <br/>
daily!<br/>
So, now I've decided to join again, but not for emails, I have <br/>
elected to to read them on the web. <br/>
I have let the webmaster know that I would like to claim my boxes, <br/>
"The Woodelves" Hampton, Windham County, CT  and "jurneez Crescent <br/>
Moon, Scotland, Windham County, CT.<br/>
BUT for those folks who do not receivve the daily Load of emails, <br/>
isn't it possible they don't know about the discussion of Abandoned <br/>
boxes and someone else adopting them?  Thank You anyway to Teach and <br/>
Preach for the concern.<br/>
Thank You Woodchuck for bringing this to my attention.<br/>
I will restock the boxes very soon!<br/>

We're encouraging everyone to try and trace and contact owners to let them<br/>
know about the changes and to help them register with the new website if<br/>
necessary, before worrying about adopting the boxes. Doing this has had a high<br/>
success rate so far :-)<br/>
