                    <div class="plaintext-content">I checked up on this box while on my lunchtime walk today.  I'm sorry <br/>
to say it's in terrible shape.  The logbook is soaked, the box is <br/>
leaky and has two critter bites in the lid.  I rehid and recovered <br/>
the box as much as I could, but I didn't have any paper towels with <br/>
me to do any repairs.  I forget who the owner of the box is, the <br/>
clues aren't on the web page anymore?, but I thought someone would <br/>
like to know.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, it's an easy box to get and hasn't had many visitors... I'd <br/>
recommend it as a drive-by if anyone's looking!  Once it's repaired, <br/>
of course!<br/>
