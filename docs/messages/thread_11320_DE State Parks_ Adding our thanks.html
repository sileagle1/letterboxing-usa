                    <html><body>We would like to second Curious Crane's note of appreciation to Superintendent Patrick Cooper and the Delaware State Park authorities.  Mr. Cooper went out of his way to contact us initially regarding the status of our letterbox and to discuss the pros and cons of letterboxing in Cape Henlopen State Park.  He then safeguarded the removed boxes and kept in touch with us while the policy-makers decided whether or not to allow them.  We are grateful for his efforts and for the final decision of the park authorities, which we hope may set an example for other parks.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, also, to Curious Crane's parents for replacing our box, to DrewClan for retrieving our original clue for Henlopen Tower, and to Witchiepoo for contributing to our discussion with Superintendent Cooper about letterboxing.  Let's hear it for Delaware!<br/>
