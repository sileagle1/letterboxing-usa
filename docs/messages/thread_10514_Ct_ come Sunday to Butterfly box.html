                    <html><body>oohhh... I would love to, but wouldn't be able to get to Chaplin until 1:30 or so, since church gets out at around 12:10 or so.  (I talked about this to Butterfly today while boxing).  Any chance on delaying it an hour or so?  If not, that's ok.... I can catch up with you all another time.  Perhaps, you can find a different box then meet for Butterfly's birthday?

Hello<br/>
I hope it is still a go for tomorrow.  Gathering together in the woods at
such a pretty place and having a dog such as Molly to hug would be most healing
for me. Thank you Chuch for saying you are planning to go.<br/>
