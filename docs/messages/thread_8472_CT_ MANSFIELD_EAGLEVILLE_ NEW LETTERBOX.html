<br/>
PLACED: 10-17-02<br/>
<br/>
RATED: Easy, short walk <br/>
<br/>
LOCATION: Eagleville Dam (East Side) <br/>
          Mansfield,CT <br/>
<br/>
PLACED BY: Fireman2B (with help from Irish Mum) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Leader of the Pack's Letterbox "Sit and Relax, and <br/>
Cock-A-Doodle Moo's 4H Letterbox "Eagleville Preserve" are across the <br/>
street at the Eagleville Preserve.<br/>
<br/>
This is the first box Fireman2B has planted. He is very excited! He <br/>
drew a picture of the Dam and carved the stamp himself. He also <br/>
helped with the clues! This is one of his favorite places to visit. <br/>
Jake "the big yellow dog" loves to swim here too! <br/>
<br/>
At the intersection of Rte.32 and Rte.275 in Eagleville, turn onto <br/>
275 heading west toward Coventry. Follow down the hill and under the <br/>
railroad pass. Park in the dirt lot on the right. <br/>
Climb the large stone staircase to the top. Stop to look at the <br/>
beautiful view, especially in the fall with the colors of the leaves <br/>
mirrored on the lake. Listen to the sound of the water rushing over <br/>
the dam. Imagine what it was like back in the day when the Eagleville <br/>
Mill was here. The mill was built in 1814 and stood here on the East <br/>
Side of the dam. It was the first mill in Connecticut to weave cotton <br/>
cloth. The mill housed several manufacturing businesses over a 130 <br/>
year period. Sterling Fiber Co., which manufactured shoe supplies, <br/>
was the last occupant. They closed after World War II. The mill stood <br/>
vacant and in disrepair for many years. Finally, the mill was to be <br/>
burned to get rid of it. The Eagleville Volunteer Fire Department <br/>
intended on burning the mill in stages, to provide training for the <br/>
firefighters, but the mill was old and saturated with various <br/>
chemicals from its manufacturing days, which caused the building <br/>
to "flash over" and burn furiously. The Firefighters certainly got <br/>
some training that day in July of 1956. If you know any "old timers" <br/>
who are members of the Eagleville Fire Department, ask them if they <br/>
remember the day the Eagleville Mill burned down. They are sure to <br/>
have a story to tell! <br/>
<br/>
Now turn, and walk across the grass toward the train tracks and <br/>
around the wooden railings of a lookout point. Walk over to the dry <br/>
hydrant protruding from the ground. Face the water and walk down <br/>
the hill and stop at the large flat rock. Look to the right. Sneak <br/>
into a little path. There is a small stone wall in there on the <br/>
right. Tucked inside the middle of the wall behind a medium sized <br/>
rock is your treasure. Please stamp and re-seal the box tightly. Hide <br/>
it again and be sure no one can see it. This is a busy place and it <br/>
may be difficult to be discreet. Please take it back to your car and <br/>
stamp it there if you see there are people around. While we were <br/>
there placing the letterbox we saw the 2 resident swans on the lake. <br/>
We also saw geese and we were there just in time for the train! <br/>
<br/>
