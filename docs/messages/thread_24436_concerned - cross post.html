 yesterday i played hookey from work and climbed a particular mountain to<br/>
find my holy grail. this elusive letterbox is one of the first boxes in new<br/>
hampshire, been there for over 4 years now. this is the 4th year in a row<br/>
that i have climbed that mountain in search of it. i knew where i was going<br/>
and with much excitement went to the spot where i believed it was. i was<br/>
correct, it was there, sitting out in plain sight. in plain sight! talk<br/>
about deflation, i was no longer excited, i was shell shocked. in plain<br/>
sight here sat a piece of letterboxing history. in this case you would not<br/>
even have had to "hide it better than you find it", you had only to put it<br/>
back in its rightful place. i did not recognize the last 3 finders, and 2 of<br/>
these did not have a stamp. it has been said before but i am saying it again<br/>
 hide the letterboxes well. be a concerned letterboxer. <br/>
<br/>
sadly, <br/>
uneksia<br/>
