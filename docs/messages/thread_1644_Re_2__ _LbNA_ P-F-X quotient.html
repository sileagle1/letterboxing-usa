<br/>
I know I am just an old Brit...but can I offer you my 2c worth about PFX<br/>
and the Dartmoor model..cos I like your X count but maybe you'd like to<br/>
hear about how we do it...<br/>
<br/>
To make em clear here's a basic list of types of stamps we have....there<br/>
are a few other oddities..but broadly...<br/>
<br/>
On the wild moor of Dartmoor we have normal boxes and those "moving boxes"<br/>
...what LbNA calls hitchhikers (a much better name imho)..<br/>
<br/>
These are just the same (roughly) as US boxes ... so far so good...(?)<br/>
<br/>
We count these as "score" boxes...F count to the LBNA members.<br/>
<br/>
If you place one / put one out, LbNA counts a P rating..(we don't count<br/>
P's in the UK).<br/>
<br/>
We also have boxes in buildings like<br/>
pubs/restaurants/churches/hotels/garages even non-buildings like vending<br/>
vehicles ..selling, say ice cream. <br/>
<br/>
( I even know one very famous University which has a secret box at the<br/>
Porters Lodge !..but that is an "extreme site" so do beware !...sticking<br/>
alligators dangerous ? pah ! try prodding a UK University Porter ! <lol>)<br/>
<br/>
There is an agreement (unwritten) that to "Join" the 100 club these latter<br/>
building boxes  aren't counted ... initially at least...ie after the first<br/>
100 then "maybe"....Some folk keep a separate count of these building<br/>
types. (I do)<br/>
<br/>
These are not very common in the US I believe, but there are some book<br/>
boxes (or were) ..I recall some in Vermont I believe...I haven't checked<br/>
lately..they were a nice idea too.. jmho.<br/>
<br/>
But we also have "travellers"...<br/>
<br/>
No not travelling or moving boxes (hitchhikers) but boxes carried by<br/>
letterboxers to give to other boxers when meeting them on the moor....like<br/>
the X (E) count..<br/>
<br/>
But we "don't" use our personal stamp...we use a special "exchange<br/>
stamp"..some folk even change em from year to year and there are some that<br/>
last only over say the Christmas/New year holiday.<br/>
<br/>
It's a debate if these are "specials" like the Meet Stamp (Special event<br/>
stamps)..but my view is if they are on the move with a boxer then that's a<br/>
"traveller".<br/>
<br/>
We keep a separate catalogue of "travellers" and they can be much more<br/>
ornate than other stamps..the nearest idea I can compare them too is QSL<br/>
cards issued by radio hams.<br/>
<br/>
It is not uncommon for a boxer to carry a set of prepared cards with<br/>
his/her traveller ready stamped up on some 6 x 4's , often multicoloured<br/>
and with stylish extras like embossing and stuff. <br/>
<br/>
The basic "rules" (if there are any ) is that you do "exchange".. ie<br/>
one-for-one.. and only if they are asked for ..and only on the moor....The<br/>
question "Are you carrying a traveller ?" may result in a card or an odd<br/>
look <grin><br/>
<br/>
These are the nearest to LBNA X counts I think, but the idea of giving<br/>
your "personal" to someone is a bit odd, when viewed from my side of the<br/>
pond...<br/>
<br/>
Finally a little tale from when I was a newby boxer with my even younger<br/>
son, then about 6years old  I guess.  We were setting off from a remote<br/>
car park and as we put on our boots another intrepid couple of hikers<br/>
drove up and parked nearby.  My young son told em we were going "boxing"<br/>
but sadly that he hadn't got a 1000 yet !  They smiled...and I was sure<br/>
they didn't know what the Dickens he meant and so we went merrily on our<br/>
way.  On our return,  under the wiper blade was a zip lock bag with two<br/>
lovely travellers and a note "To Leo, to help you to your first 1000".<br/>
<br/>
Boxers are cute ..and secretive...we discovered later that they were<br/>
10,000 plus count hi-rolling boxers !<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally I keep separate indices for:<br/>
<br/>
M=moor boxes<br/>
T=travellers (=X in LbNA land)<br/>
B=buildings <br/>
W=walk sets (planned walks on the moors)<br/>
S=specials (non outside / event stamps etc)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
M+W = my true boxing score..Because I used my skill <? >,judgement <??>,<br/>
and effort <???>, to find those "on the hoof" so to speak !<br/>
<br/>
And of course M+W = "Moorland Wizard" after all ! <lol><br/>
<br/>
That's a Brits 2c about T or X counts ..there's lots of room for even more<br/>
stamp categories in letterboxland I feel. <g><br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays.<br/>
Enjoy many good boxing outings and keep scoring...Mind those P's and X's<br/>
<grin><br/>

PS one day I plan to add a "F" category myself in honour of LbNA but so<br/>
far my US F count = 0 <sob>...<bigger grin=""><br/>
