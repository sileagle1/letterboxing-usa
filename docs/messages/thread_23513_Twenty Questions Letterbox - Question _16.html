Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Assume the next question (#17) will pinpoint the city, let's start  <br/>
discussing what our options are for the next question. <br/>
<br/>
We could continue to divide it geographically, but I'm not sure we could  <br/>
slice it up small enough in 3 questions.<br/>
<br/>
We could start assembling a list of types of areas where it might likely be  <br/>
hidden, such as parks, audubons, cemeteries, historic buildings, conservation  <br/>
areas, businesses etc. You get the idea. Keep in mind we still need to find a <br/>
 wall.<br/>
<br/>
Any other thoughts?<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Once we pinpoint the town, then I think looking at what parks, wildlife<br/>
areas, nature preserves, etc are in the area is a good idea.    You could<br/>
ask a general question like "Is the box located within or near to a local<br/>
park or conservation land?"    You could also ask "Is the box in or near a<br/>
cemetary?"     "Is the box located somewhere easily seen by the public?<br/>
Seen from a road?"<br/>

One other question that could be asked  "Is the stone wall near a named or<br/>
numbered (marked) trail?"<br/>
