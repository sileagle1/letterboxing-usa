                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry you couldn't find Harriman Tracks #5.  Truthfully, I don't know whether <br/>
or not it's there ... it's been awhile since I've checked, but I'll find out <br/>
soon and let you know.  I can tell you that as of yesterday (Monday, April <br/>
28th) #s 1, 2 and 3 were.  I led a hike to that area and the group found them <br/>
all without a hitch. (That's the day you should have planned your hike in <br/>
Harriman Park.  It was a beauty.) <br/>
<br/>
#4 was present and accounted for last November, but I haven't been there <br/>
since nor heard anything one way or the other.   The clues for number 4 are <br/>
especially straight forward and therefore the box should be easy to find, <br/>
assuming it is still there.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
