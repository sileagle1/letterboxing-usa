Hybrid geocache/letterbox<br/>
By Flyfisher (geoflyfisher@yahoo.com)<br/>
<br/>
Here is a letterbox that requires you to visit the USAF Museum (free) <br/>
and use a GPS among the outdoor exhibits.  Plan 2 hours or so to get <br/>
this one. Fair warning: I believe this one may be nearly impossible <br/>
unless you or someone with you has a GPSR.<br/>
<br/>
START this fun by going to the USAF Museum.   I'd suggest parking at <br/>
the small parking lot at N 39 46.974 W 84 06.508. If you have never <br/>
been to the museum, this is your chance to explore some of the <br/>
exhibits. It takes about a day to look at the displays inside. For <br/>
this geocache/letterbox, you will concentrate on the outdoors <br/>
exhibits where a GPS works.<br/>
<br/>
Question A: What is the tail number (look at the tail) of the <br/>
aircraft south of N 39 47.016 W 84 06.540? <br/>
Question A answer is ____________ <br/>
<br/>
Question B: What is the maximum speed in knots of this beast to your <br/>
south when you are at N 39 47.128 W 84 06.392?<br/>
Question B answer is ____________ <br/>
<br/>
Question C: What is the wingspan of the aircraft nearest you when you <br/>
are at N 39 47.161 W 84 06.359?<br/>
Question C answer (nearest foot) __________ <br/>
<br/>
Question D: Go to N 39 47.041 W 84 06.537. What year was this Tank <br/>
dedicated?<br/>
Question D answer ____________ <br/>
<br/>
Calculation: Add A +C: Answer __________<br/>
Subtract 60158<br/>
Result XXX is ___________ <br/>
<br/>
Calculation: Add B + D: Answer ___________<br/>
Subtract 1477<br/>
Result YYY is ____________ <br/>
<br/>
NEXT STEP: Go to the parking coordinates for a nearby park.  (N 39 <br/>
47.135 W 84 08.006) and then find the cache at N 39 47.XXX and W 84 <br/>
07.YYY. <br/>
<br/>
Have fun. If you use some common sense (which is not very common) you <br/>
need not leave the paths until you get within 30 feet of the cache.<br/>
Hint: When you reach the obstruction on the path, there is a forked <br/>
tree to the east. The cache is under a small locust tree (thorns) <br/>
fifteen feet further east. <br/>
