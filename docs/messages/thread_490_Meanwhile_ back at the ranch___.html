Here in Portland, Oregon, Letterboxing lives on.  I took my mother-in-law <br/>
letterboxing this weekend.  This is no small statement, considering that she <br/>
has chronic asthma w/ complications and is confined to an electric wheelchair.<br/>
<br/>
A perfectly beautiful Oregon day was reason enough for our adventure.  We set <br/>
out from my own back yard with a couple of stamps, a pad of paper, and a set <br/>
of clues.  She has a spare cart, like the kind that the supermarkets provide, <br/>
so I chose this as my trusty steed.  This made her feel more comfortable than <br/>
if I would have walked along beside her... and my feet didn't argue a bit.<br/>
<br/>
About an hour later, we were stamping into Thom Cheney's Rock Creek Letterbox <br/>
Number 1.  "Mom" found the location by her self (I helped pull it out of its <br/>
hole) and thoroughly LOVED the whole outing.  She's been calling all her <br/>
relatives, telling them she's a "Letterboxer"!!!<br/>
<br/>
Loved the new stamp (Number Three) in the box, Thom!!!!  It is the cutest one <br/>
you've done, yet.  Hope to see your artwork appearing soon on the new <br/>
website!!!<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Love,<br/>
Der Mad Stamper<br/>
