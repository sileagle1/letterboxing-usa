                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a standard small certificate that I make, approx. 3 x 4".  It's a <br/>
combination of a clip art frame with some word art that prints out the following <br/>
information along the inside contour of the oval opening of the frame:  "First <br/>
Finder Certificate" and location of box.  In the center of the oval, I include <br/>
the name of the box, and my nom de stamp.  I like to use nifty fonts when I <br/>
make the certificates.  Often use Carla font, since I think it has an "official <br/>
look" to it.  Centered within the oval, behind all the text, I place a <br/>
watermark of the stamp image.  <br/>
<br/>
Since I tend to make small boxes, I use a small certificate.  Sometimes the <br/>
stamp image is a bit too big to stamp directly into the oval frame and have a <br/>
nice, neat fit.  Plus, I figure that the finder gets an official stamped image <br/>
in their journal anyway.  Since I always scan my final carved images before <br/>
placing a box (posterity sake, just in case the box ever goes missing, etc.), <br/>
it's just as easy to use that scanned image, turn it into a watermark, size to <br/>
fit the opening in the certificate, and drop it in the center.<br/>
<br/>
I print out the certificate in color, tuck it into the front of the logbook, <br/>
and plant the box.  I think the certificate is small enough so it can be <br/>
somehow incorporated into someone's journal, if they wish.  If I were to ever find <br/>
a certificate, I would somehow want to affix it in my journal, either through <br/>
creation of a pocket I can slip it into, or by adhering it to a journal page <br/>
with adhesive, or eyelets, or brads, etc.  Can you tell I'm originally a <br/>
stamper who fell into letterboxing?  I like to cut and paste!  LOL<br/>
