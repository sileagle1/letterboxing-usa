to this addictive hobby, but My Compass find puts me at 46, and I <br/>
will reach 50 tomorrow, woohoo!again! <br/>

Just wanted to add that my 100th find was at the 100 mile wilderness (totally <br/>
not planned) but unique coincidence that happened recently! <br/>
<br/>
Started out this year thinking ok... 50 boxes would be a nice goal... didn't think <br/>
100 boxes was possible but I've had a great time hunting and meeting all you <br/>
nice people out there! Thanks for making it a rewarding adventure! <br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!<br/>
