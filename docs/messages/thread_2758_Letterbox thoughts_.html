<div>Squirrel and I have been 
musing lately, wishing there were some "new" boxes and boxers in our area 
(Mid-Atlantic) (I know there are a few but "we" haven't seen much of an 
increase of planted boxes) I have noticed lately, a lot of summertime 
vacation travel and several out of state boxers traveling through "our" 
area and doing some letterboxing at the same.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Don't be shy. Feel free to 
drop a couple of <strong>your</strong> letterboxes along the way. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>They don't always have to 
match the park or trail. They can be generic stamps (flowers, animals, 
birds) just waiting for a new home. Both Squirrel and I started in this 
area with the idea of "find one leave one" That is why we have several parks and 
areas with one of hers and one of mine, and why I have so many of her stamps in 
my log.  It is also why I have boxes in 6 states. As you may have seen 
lately, maintenance of your boxes is not really a problem. There is always 
someone local and willing to keep an eye on things and make any needed repairs. 
The nice benefit also of the eList.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>An example is an upcoming 
business trip I am making to Denver. I have found at least 2 large parks near 
where I am staying. I won't have time to hit the high mountain trails, but I am 
still planning on taking a hour or two after work and plant a couple of 
boxes. Place a few here and a few there and that is how the fun 
spreads.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for 
listening.</div>

<div>PS    One of 
these days I will get a hitchhiker and add a X to my count.......</div>

people might wonder if we're pushy, but we love to add a box or two <br/>
to a trail already "taken" by someone else.<br/>

I even thought of carving a stamp and planting a box when I was down, but, I <br/>
had given my carving material to a fellow boxer for her to make some stamps <br/>
for boxes she wanted to plant in New Jersey and did not make the time to go <br/>
out and get more carving medium :(<br/>
Lockmaster and I have enjoyed our Maryland letterboxing this year, two trips <br/>
to visit family and 11 stamps to show for it....<br/>
We promise that the next time we are down we will plant two, one for him and <br/>
one for me!!(LOL)<br/>
Thanks for all the fun you have given us Squirrel!! And we loved seeing the <br/>
Drew Clan's stamps in some of the boxes we found!! :)<br/>
<br/>
As always, Happy 'boxing !!  See Joy<br/>

Hey Jay...and Squirrel,<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering..have either of you ever tried for my Scrabble Mystery <br/>
box?...there's one and 3 more placed along with it not too far from <br/>
home for either of you.  I've never heard from you two or anyone else <br/>
about those.  I almost hated to make those a mystery since I like <br/>
those stamps the best of all I've carved.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be in SC for a few days this month while my daughter attends <br/>
soccer camp at USC.  I've searched out some trails around Columbia <br/>
and Sumter and plan to hide a few boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
As for getting you "X'd", guess maybe it's time we started to plan a <br/>
letterboxing day that suits our schedules...What do you two think?<br/>
<br/>
