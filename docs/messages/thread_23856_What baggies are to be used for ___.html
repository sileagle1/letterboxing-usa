For the record, those plastic baggies that you see in most <br/>
letterboxes are there to keep things DRY.  Let's think a moment about <br/>
what the critical items are in a letterbox that might need to be dry.<br/>
<br/>
1. The letterbox itself.  Well, not really.  It is plastic, and if <br/>
you're planting responsibly, you're using solid, reasonably <br/>
watertight containers such as Rubbermaid or Lock-n-Locks anyway, and <br/>
not some flimsy throw-away Glad Ware. Besides, a plastic bag outside <br/>
the letterbox doesn't really do much anyway is it pretty much is <br/>
guaranteed to be torn almost instantly.<br/>
<br/>
2.  The stamp and ink pad.  Well, stamps are made of rubber, and <br/>
exposure to the elements can ultimately damage them, or at least <br/>
allow fungus to grow on them, but they are fairly hardy.  They won't <br/>
be ruined by getting wet.  The ink pad, if included, is a little more <br/>
fragile, although most ink pads are surrounded by plastic which <br/>
generally resist water.  It's a good idea to put these in a bag, <br/>
though, to help protect them.<br/>
<br/>
3.  The logbook.  Easy.  At least one would think.  Unless someone is <br/>
out there using some space-age water-resistent kind of material for <br/>
their logbook, generally logbooks are made of PAPER.  And paper is <br/>
certainly most susceptible to being damaged when wet.  You'll <br/>
definitely want to keep that logbook dry ... and a solid, non-zipper <br/>
freezer bag, preferably double bagged, does the trick.<br/>
<br/>
OK -- so what have we learned?  When discovering a letterbox where <br/>
baggies are missing, or where only one bag exists -- it is the <br/>
LOGBOOK that needs to be covered.  Let me repeat.  If only one bag is <br/>
available, for whatever reason -- cover the LOGBOOK.  Again, the <br/>
LOGBOOK.  OK, one more time for good measure.  The LOGBOOK needs to <br/>
be in the bag.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.  Perhaps now I will stop finding letterboxes who've lost <br/>
all but one baggie, only to find that the last finder decided that <br/>
the stamp and inkpad was a better candidate to put in a bag, leaving <br/>
the logbook to just sit there exposed.  Or -- in the case of one of <br/>
my boxes I just checked on for which one bag for the stamp/ink pad <br/>
and one for the logbook was instead replaced with the stamp/ink pad <br/>
in one bag and the letterbox itself jammed into the other -- again, <br/>
leaving the logbook open and exposed. HELLO!<br/>

you might have been unclear.<br/>
<br/>
Just kidding...and I completely agree.  I have even found lock-and-<br/>
locks that have gotten moisture inside them, so the baggies are very <br/>
important.  I hope everyone carries extra baggies with them when they <br/>
are out letterboxing - I do.  I try to make sure when I leave a box <br/>
(especially if someone has used one of those cheapie disposable <br/>
containers) that the logbook is in one bag, the stamp is in another <br/>
bag, and both of those bags are in a third bag.  This seems to help.<br/>

So it is the logbook we want dry then? (LOL) Actually , I do put mine in a baggie inside the box and then put the box in a big heavy duty baggie , just to be sure. I image over time my big baggie will get some holes though :)<br/>

This is known as the Letterbox Moisture Retention System (LeMoRS). <br/>
Since the outer baggies are guaranteed to tear, puncture or unseal <br/>
within days of planting, all the system does is ensure that any fluid <br/>
that reaches inside the baggie will remain in contact with the <br/>
letterbox into perpetuity, which is does with a near 100% performance <br/>
record....<br/>

Excuse me, what about the logbook? Shouldn't that be in a bag?<br/>
<br/>
Did you say put the logbook in a bag?<br/>

&gt; For the record, those plastic baggies that you see in most <br/>
&gt; letterboxes are there to keep things DRY.  Let's think a moment <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; what the critical items are in a letterbox that might need to be <br/>
dry.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. The letterbox itself.  Well, not really.  It is plastic, and if <br/>
&gt; you're planting responsibly, you're using solid, reasonably <br/>
&gt; watertight containers such as Rubbermaid or Lock-n-Locks anyway, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; not some flimsy throw-away Glad Ware. Besides, a plastic bag <br/>
outside <br/>
&gt; the letterbox doesn't really do much anyway is it pretty much is <br/>
&gt; guaranteed to be torn almost instantly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.  The stamp and ink pad.  Well, stamps are made of rubber, and <br/>
&gt; exposure to the elements can ultimately damage them, or at least <br/>
&gt; allow fungus to grow on them, but they are fairly hardy.  They <br/>
won't <br/>
&gt; be ruined by getting wet.  The ink pad, if included, is a little <br/>
more <br/>
&gt; fragile, although most ink pads are surrounded by plastic which <br/>
&gt; generally resist water.  It's a good idea to put these in a bag, <br/>
&gt; though, to help protect them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3.  The logbook.  Easy.  At least one would think.  Unless someone <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; out there using some space-age water-resistent kind of material <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; their logbook, generally logbooks are made of PAPER.  And paper is <br/>
&gt; certainly most susceptible to being damaged when wet.  You'll <br/>
&gt; definitely want to keep that logbook dry ... and a solid, non-<br/>
zipper <br/>
&gt; freezer bag, preferably double bagged, does the trick.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OK -- so what have we learned?  When discovering a letterbox where <br/>
&gt; baggies are missing, or where only one bag exists -- it is the <br/>
&gt; LOGBOOK that needs to be covered.  Let me repeat.  If only one bag <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; available, for whatever reason -- cover the LOGBOOK.  Again, the <br/>
&gt; LOGBOOK.  OK, one more time for good measure.  The LOGBOOK needs <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; be in the bag.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you.  Perhaps now I will stop finding letterboxes who've <br/>
lost <br/>
&gt; all but one baggie, only to find that the last finder decided that <br/>
&gt; the stamp and inkpad was a better candidate to put in a bag, <br/>
leaving <br/>
&gt; the logbook to just sit there exposed.  Or -- in the case of one <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; my boxes I just checked on for which one bag for the stamp/ink pad <br/>
&gt; and one for the logbook was instead replaced with the stamp/ink <br/>
pad <br/>
&gt; in one bag and the letterbox itself jammed into the other -- <br/>
again, <br/>
&gt; leaving the logbook open and exposed. HELLO!<br/>

  &gt; This is known as the Letterbox Moisture Retention System (LeMoRS). <br/>

  Too funny!! I initially made the mistake of placing the first few <br/>
  boxes I planted INSIDE a large bag, thinking it would protect them <br/>
  better. WRONG!! Moisture retention is exactly what it does. In <br/>
  addition, it makes it much easier for an animal to drag off and also <br/>
  much more "visible" to a passing muggle. Once I realized this, I went <br/>
  back and removed the outer "box bags" (and of course they were <br/>
  punctured and retaining moisture).<br/>

How do people forget the baggies?  They get excited.  They're with <br/>

Also, for the habit of people putting the whole box in a bag (this <br/>
spells disaster in the rainy part of the Pacific NW):  Mark your <br/>
baggies with "Logbook outer bag" "Logbook inner bag" "Rubber stamp <br/>
bag", etc.  Might help those people realize anew, as CPAScott said so <br/>

&gt; Yes, but it is frustrating how often I go to check on a box that I <br/>
did not have inside an outer bag and somebody has *kindly* placed it <br/>
in an outer bag for me.  This past weekend we checked in on about 8 <br/>
letterboxes and 2 were found inside bags that should not have been.  <br/>
Several others were missing inside bags and/or had either the stamp <br/>
or the logbook exposed and not in a baggie.  One had no baggies in it <br/>
at all.  So where do these baggies go?   I doubt that a critter came <br/>
along looking for a spare baggie to bag his leftover lunch and nicely <br/>
placed everything back inside my rubbermaid container after swiping <br/>
the bag.  No, more likely a *person* put it back like that...  how <br/>
can you put everything back into the container and not notice that <br/>
you forgot the baggies?<br/>

&gt;   From Silent Doug <silentdoug@...> <br/>
&gt;   &gt; This is known as the Letterbox Moisture Retention System <br/>
(LeMoRS). <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Since the outer baggies are guaranteed to tear, puncture or <br/>
unseal <br/>
&gt;   &gt; within days of planting, all the system does is ensure that any <br/>
&gt;   &gt; fluid <br/>
&gt;   &gt; that reaches inside the baggie will remain in contact with the <br/>
&gt;   &gt; letterbox into perpetuity, which is does with a near 100% <br/>
&gt;   &gt; performance <br/>
&gt;   &gt; record....<br/>

&gt;   Too funny!! I initially made the mistake of placing the first few <br/>
&gt;   boxes I planted INSIDE a large bag, thinking it would protect <br/>
them <br/>
&gt;   better. WRONG!! Moisture retention is exactly what it does. In <br/>
&gt;   addition, it makes it much easier for an animal to drag off and <br/>
also <br/>
&gt;   much more "visible" to a passing muggle. Once I realized this, I <br/>
went <br/>
&gt;   back and removed the outer "box bags" (and of course they were <br/>
&gt;   punctured and retaining moisture).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Typical "newbie" error!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; For the record, those plastic baggies that you see in most <br/>
&gt; letterboxes are there to keep things DRY.  Let's think a moment about <br/>
&gt; what the critical items are in a letterbox that might need to be dry.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. The letterbox itself.  Well, not really.  It is plastic, and if <br/>
&gt; you're planting responsibly, you're using solid, reasonably <br/>
&gt; watertight containers such as Rubbermaid or Lock-n-Locks anyway, and <br/>
&gt; not some flimsy throw-away Glad Ware. Besides, a plastic bag outside <br/>
&gt; the letterbox doesn't really do much anyway is it pretty much is <br/>
&gt; guaranteed to be torn almost instantly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.  The stamp and ink pad.  Well, stamps are made of rubber, and <br/>
&gt; exposure to the elements can ultimately damage them, or at least <br/>
&gt; allow fungus to grow on them, but they are fairly hardy.  They won't <br/>
&gt; be ruined by getting wet.  The ink pad, if included, is a little more <br/>
&gt; fragile, although most ink pads are surrounded by plastic which <br/>
&gt; generally resist water.  It's a good idea to put these in a bag, <br/>
&gt; though, to help protect them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3.  The logbook.  Easy.  At least one would think.  Unless someone is <br/>
&gt; out there using some space-age water-resistent kind of material for <br/>
&gt; their logbook, generally logbooks are made of PAPER.  And paper is <br/>
&gt; certainly most susceptible to being damaged when wet.  You'll <br/>
&gt; definitely want to keep that logbook dry ... and a solid, non-zipper <br/>
&gt; freezer bag, preferably double bagged, does the trick.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OK -- so what have we learned?  When discovering a letterbox where <br/>
&gt; baggies are missing, or where only one bag exists -- it is the <br/>
&gt; LOGBOOK that needs to be covered.  Let me repeat.  If only one bag is <br/>
&gt; available, for whatever reason -- cover the LOGBOOK.  Again, the <br/>
&gt; LOGBOOK.  OK, one more time for good measure.  The LOGBOOK needs to <br/>
&gt; be in the bag.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you.  Perhaps now I will stop finding letterboxes who've lost <br/>
&gt; all but one baggie, only to find that the last finder decided that <br/>
&gt; the stamp and inkpad was a better candidate to put in a bag, leaving <br/>
&gt; the logbook to just sit there exposed.  Or -- in the case of one of <br/>
&gt; my boxes I just checked on for which one bag for the stamp/ink pad <br/>
&gt; and one for the logbook was instead replaced with the stamp/ink pad <br/>
&gt; in one bag and the letterbox itself jammed into the other -- again, <br/>
&gt; leaving the logbook open and exposed. HELLO!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <rant off=""><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Remember -- protect the LOGBOOK.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your cooperation is appreciated.<br/>

<br/>
Those are Lock &amp; Locks from Target or Walmart (thus far). I love them. I did actually find one with the top on backwards; still snapped. And the inside bag not sealed. Fortunately I was right after her adding more Mystery Clue slips to that box. The box had the clue taped inside it (which was now outside and readable). Would have thought that would have been a hint. Busy area, probably trying to be quick! All 3 others in the series were perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Pirates, if you come across any of my other Lock &amp; Lock boxes, feel free to remove the "LeMoRS" for me. I'll replace any cheap containers as I go. I'm guilty of early outside bagging. And I did just find someone's LB with at least 2 inches of water inside. The box was perfectly dry and a gladware container. More shocked I couldn't have been!<br/>
<br/>
Loving the topic; very educational!<br/>
