Planted 9/8/02<br/>
By Leader of the Pack ,Purple Cow and Flower Child<br/>
At Wapping Fair grounds  -  Rye Street Park<br/>
( home of Cute Cluckers Letterbox also)<br/>
Rated easy<br/>
<br/>
    The date of Sept 6 found 4-H members busy with the job of body <br/>
clipping their 4-H cow projects in preparation for the fair. Many <br/>
hours of  beauty treatment go into preparing these bovine beauties <br/>
for their few minutes in the show ring.  This is hard work  if you <br/>
ever saw a little kid with a first haircut you know  IT TICKLES!  So <br/>
imagine these beauties and their ticklish tummies being clipped. All <br/>
the 4-H kids learn  so much about management and time mangement while <br/>
preparing the project for the fair. Wapping Fair on Sept 7&amp;8, was the <br/>
second fair so the experience paid off and the kids and their  calves <br/>
came out of the ring with ribbons of Blue, red , white and yellow. It <br/>
was a very good day!<br/>
    Another yellow item was in everyone's view that weekend. In fact <br/>
quite a lot of round yellow items. Our cow tent was right near them <br/>
and so is your new Letterbox. Go to where there are round yellow <br/>
things aplenty. Between 2&amp;3  on the rise where the tent was erected <br/>
you will find a low home to the Cream of the Crop in honor of those <br/>
beauties who paraded here at the Dairy Show. <br/>
   This is a busy little park so camoflage your activity with another <br/>
like frisbee catch then take a snack break to  cover your stamping <br/>
activity if anyone is around. Don't give away the secret home of the <br/>
letterbox. Thanks and as always Be Safe and Have Fun<br/>
