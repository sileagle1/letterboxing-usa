I would recommend reading the FAQ on the letterboxing.org website and make <br/>
sure you take lots of water when you get out to hike. Oh, and perhaps you might <br/>
enjoy thinking about a trail name (certainly not necessary, but is fun).... <br/>
Those are my tips. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your first outing. You're in good company. We're all a bit obsessed <br/>
about those elusive rubbermaid containers. <br/>

Now that the letter has gone out, I'd like to say something else....<br/>
<br/>
I actually know Pandora in real life, she's the one that made mention of Letterboxing to Kris and that's what got us started.  I just wanted to show that it is so very easy for others to take what is said out of context others to react to them.  Those types of words are read in the frame<br/>
of mind that the recipient is in, not in the frame of mind the sender is in as we are missing two very vital aspects of  human communications, Tonal qualities and Body language.  With those missing, perception is reality. In other words, no matter how I meant what I typed, you'll read it in your frame of reference.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that ar to often, people are getting their (insert appropriate form of undergarment here) in a wad over things that really are not that important. I mean, come on, a war in Iraq still going on, troops perhaps heading to Liberia, The national Debt, the jobless rate, layoffs without warning, the crime rate climbing, near drought conditions in 3/4 of the world and water shortages only over the horizon, starving people all over the world, crude oil prices rising meaning higher pump prices, etc, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I do letterboxing because it's fun, I do it for relaxation, I do it because it allows me to complete with the one person I can compete with and not get angry if they win.... Myself. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
My hope is that we'll all go back to what this once was, according to those that have been here the longest... A place where we can all have fun, and were we can exercise our right to delete that which we don't want to read. As simple as that.  I know I do and I receive this list in individual emails. Not a digest.  I'm a masochist guess.<br/>

Hello There Kerjin =P<br/>
<br/>
Okay well let me clear up the confusion -- Yeah your a pain in the butt. I<br/>
mean who introduced you to letterboxing and who is not getting to go on all<br/>
those hikes and boxes you and Kris are going on because she is home working<br/>
and too far away to leech her way?  On the letterboxing scope of things that<br/>
says PITA to me!<br/>
<br/>
Now since I know you so well real life I know that your making an example<br/>
here.  I always love being your example, and I think your example came off<br/>
just right, at first you sounded like the grumpy pooh head I know you to be<br/>
sometimes and then you come back with age old wisdome! I just luv it when ya<br/>
do that!<br/>
<br/>
As for being a twice over pain in the butt because your a twice over<br/>
newbie --- umm can we call it even now? I do believe I was in your shoes<br/>
about a year ago in your relam, on your list being a pain in the but because<br/>
I was new? <giggle><br/>
<br/>
No need to apologize to me Kerjin you always know that --- if anything make<br/>
it a little more inconvient and make it hurt just a little more and I will<br/>
just luv having you around.  I know -- I'm twisted.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone else should probably ignore this thread if you can't find the humor<br/>
value in it....<br/>
But then again -- if you don't ignore it I can be a PITA too!<br/>
<br/>
To quote catbead<br/>
<br/>
I'm a PITA,<br/>
You're a PITA,<br/>
wouldn't ya like ta be a PITA tooooo...<br/>
beeee a PITA,<br/>
yeah beeee a PITA,<br/>
beeee a PITA,<br/>
yeah beeee a PITA,<br/>
wouldn't ya like ta be a PITA tooooo...<br/>

SNL is standing for?<br/>

But seriously, yes, he is... I can personally attest to that...  Who else would continue to search for a letterbox well after the sun has gone down in a well-treed forest to the point of not even being able to read the words on the clue page he brought with us??? It was all I could do to keep from falling flat on my face from tripping over a silly tree root that decided it was going to hide in my path of walking, all because he just HAD to find one last box!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Masochist?  yes... PITA?  No doubt about it!  Wait..... don't these two go hand in hand?????<br/>
