I think it needs a little clarification. I copied this from the <br/>
original post....<br/>
<br/>
"It's called the Letterbox Boredom Buster. Besides having a<br/>
stamp and a logbook, it also has some goodies to keep those confined<br/>
and unable to box busy for a spell. It kind of runs along the same<br/>
lines as the Purple Heart box. Anyone who is confined and not able to<br/>
get out and box for one reason or another is welcome to request the<br/>
box. This could be someone who's had surgery, broke a body part, is<br/>
confined to a wheelchair and not able to get to alot of boxes, or<br/>
even if you're just having a *really* bad winter and the snow has<br/>
kept you from going anywhere, etc...etc...etc. (I think you all get<br/>
the picture.) ;)"<br/>
<br/>
About 10 people have asked to be on the list, but only 3 of them are <br/>
actually on it since they were the only ones with legitimate reasons <br/>
for wanting the box. I'll reply to the people who aren't on the list. <br/>
So if you asked for the box and don't hear back from me, you can <br/>
assume that you're on the list. <br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone understands about this box. It's not just your <br/>
average postal box. You must, in some way, not be able to get out and <br/>
box. <br/>
<br/>

I thought about applying for this box, but decided I wasn't quite <br/>
there yet.  It's not that I'm not able to get out and box.  It's that <br/>
there aren't that many boxes around here.  I live in a box-poor <br/>
environment.  I envy the folks in Conn. and RI, who think nothing of <br/>
planning a ten box afternoon.  I've exhausted all the boxes in the <br/>
county I live in, plus in all the counties that touch my county.  <br/>
I've letterboxed in cities I've visited.  Now I find myself planning <br/>
all-day trips to counties that touch counties that touch my county.  <br/>
I'm planning longer and longer travel times to the cities that I <br/>
visit just so I can letterbox along the way.  I'm going to a party <br/>
this evening in Pittsburgh (roughly 200 miles) being held by an old <br/>
friend.  I'll be leaving before noon today.  Why?  Because I've <br/>
already found all the boxes in the vicinity of Pittsburgh, so now I'm <br/>
going to be letterboxing all the way there?  Is there anybody else <br/>
who does this sort of thing?<br/>

Yep!   I just got back from a 300 mile round trip, just for boxes.   There <br/>
were 4 of them available, and I only got two of them, due to delays and time <br/>
constraints, so I guess I'll have to go back and do it again when I can.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also planting boxes like mad, and hoping it's true when they say, "If you <br/>
plant them, they will come."<br/>

Even in the letterbox heaven that is New England, we<br/>
do that too. Whenever we're going anywhere, we include<br/>
time to box if at all possible. For exmaple, we went<br/>
to Boston last month to see Eddie Izzard in concert<br/>
(he's a transvestite comedian from Britian, for those<br/>
that don't know who he is), and specifically went very<br/>
early in the day so we could get three boxes that are<br/>
in the downtown area. Letterboxers do this because we<br/>
never pass up a chance to box, whether or not there<br/>
are lots of local ones left!<br/>
