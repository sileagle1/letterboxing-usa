Where is Paul of the cold Canfield Woods, our fab four is incomplete!<br/>
How many letterboxs have you placed? Have you managed to make a living of<br/>
this or is it still a hobby?<br/>

Just kidding!!! For some reason, that stamp has been the hardest of <br/>
the mop tops to find for lots of folks. I'm hoping to go back with a <br/>
friend and watch her search it out to discover what's wrong with the <br/>
clues. Also, keep an eye out for our carved-but-not-yet-placed <br/>
Rolling Stones series that should go in to the same park soon.<br/>
<br/>
I think we're at P290, and since we get a postive karma voucher for <br/>
each letterbox visited, we're at "Nirvana." Oh, hahahahahahahahaha<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking!<br/>

Don't worry about Paul. He is alive and a joy to find as he is to listen<br/>
to. If Lobster Lady and I can find him [on the second try ] anyone can.<br/>
!! don't change a thing.!!<br/>
