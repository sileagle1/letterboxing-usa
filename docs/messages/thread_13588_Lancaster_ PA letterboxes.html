letterboxing.org site that there are 2 boxes hidden.  Are there any <br/>
more sites out there that list boxes so as I can see if there are <br/>
more boxes to find.  thanks<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We were recently in Penn and got a few boxes. Don't know how far astray you <br/>
can go from Lancaster but here's what we got: High Rocks in Pipersville, Pa was <br/>
an amazing place with a view unsurpassed. The Doylestown Monrovian Pottery <br/>
and Tile works was a wonderful walk in the forrest. We did the covered bridge <br/>
tour in Lancaster County all the way through (a VERY special day with wonderful <br/>
scenes and countryside) but, alas, failed to get the box for some unknown <br/>
reason. We still recommend trying for it though. The owner checked and it was <br/>
there as of about a month ago.<br/>
GOOD LUCK!<br/>
