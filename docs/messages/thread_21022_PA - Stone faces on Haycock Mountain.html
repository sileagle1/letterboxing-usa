                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since there is no "contact placer" on the page . . . .I want to ask a question. We looked for the first box for half a day and couldn't find it. I think the right onto Stony Garden Road should be a left . . . as the road only goes the one way. I think though we were in the right area as we found the trails marked as described and had quite a fun day. Our confusing came in as it was not clear where the path ended. My question is . . . .is the boulder in the photo the one we should be looking for?<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, Rosie River Cat.  I live quite near Haycock Mountain, PA and could hopefully help you a bit with two of those boxes. We didn't look for the third yet--ran out of time.  I know someone who has found it though. I don't want to say stuff that I shouldn't say on the list, though, so if you'd like to email me privately at annalisa@fast.net that would probably be best.  I think the placer, Space Traveler, still "listens in" on this list now and then, and I have had the pleasure of meeting her.  I think the boxes were planted in the "early days" of boxing, and some of the clues have disappeared or are hard to locate during certain seasons.  They are findable and have nifty stamps and make a great hike, but I would agree they're not easy ones and we probably only found them because someone gave us a few additional notes.  I guess I could at least answer your question about the rocks photo. You could potentially find these boxes without ever seeing that particular "face", although I happened to see it first and it helped me know I was in the right area. Yes, I think you are right about the Stony Garden Rd. turn. Anyway, please email me and also you might want to try searching the archives for "Stone Faces on Haycock Mt." or "Mountain" and you might find the email in which I described the wild stuff that happened on our search for them!  I would say this is a good time of year to try, if you can stay out of the way of hunters and the sloshy areas.  In the summer the rock outcrops were quite hidden, as they are pretty far off the trail.  --Lunaryakketyact  (Anna Lisa) <br/>
