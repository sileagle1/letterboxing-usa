                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone.  Today I hid two new boxes on the scenic Loop Trail that <br/>
circles around Ruggles Pond at Wendell State Forest.  I also checked <br/>
onmy three boxes on the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail, two of which are <br/>
now three years old.  All were intact and have been getting visitors <br/>
steadily.  I substituted newer containers for a couple of them that <br/>
had been leaking and rewrote the clues to make the Saint-Exupery <br/>
Letterbox and Letterbox Vincent less difficult to find.  My apologies <br/>
to anyone who has looked for these two unsuccessfully!  I've decided <br/>
the locations are just fine but the clues needed improvement.<br/>
<br/>
This means there are now FIVE boxes at Wendell State Forest.  It may <br/>
not be Dartmoor, but it's a start!  The clues are here:<br/>

Thanks to all of you who have written such nice notes in the logbooks <br/>
and/or left little gifts.  I was excited to see a couple of <br/>
hitchhikers have passed through the El Corazon box.<br/>
<br/>
Happy letterboxing in Massachusetts!<br/>
