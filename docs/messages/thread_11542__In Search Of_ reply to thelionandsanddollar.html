The dinosaur in the Congo is Mokele-Mbembe. Actually that box is already and waiting to be planted. Glad you like the idea. I was always was interested in this kind of stuff. In each one, I try to give a description of what it is and will always offer links to sites about the subject. I'm hopin the carvings are ok.To this point I mostly used store bought stamps. Really got into carving over this long winter.Hope to see you guys again .....Chuck and Molly<br/>

  What a great Idea!  I had been thinking of something similar but ya <br/>
beat me to the punch.  These are great, and I can't wait to get out <br/>
and do them.  And you hit my two favorite to start off with. I hadn't <br/>
heard of Caddy befor but sounds neat.  <br/>
  Have you heard about the rumored Dinosaur in the Congo?  I can't <br/>
remember the name of the animal however it got a lot of press in the <br/>
late 80's.  It's rumored that a large suarapod type dino is there.<br/>

This sounds like alot of fun and we can't wait to get to it.  We're <br/>
really looking forward to seeing you guys on the trail again, and I <br/>
know that Ruth would like to meet Molly.  I loved the links, and the <br/>
info that they contain. And don't worry about caryings we're sure <br/>
they will be wonderful,(besides they can't be as bad as mine, Amy <br/>
does all the good work).       ;)<br/>
