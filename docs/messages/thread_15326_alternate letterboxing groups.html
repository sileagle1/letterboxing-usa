After the database debate, there was yet another group started. For <br/>
more info, email me directly at NeverEnuff1969 at yahoo.com.<br/>
<br/>
Just so everyone knows before they email me, this new group does <br/>
allow the use of a database as well as "sitreps". We do not, however, <br/>
give away any clues or mystery box locations, and we do not state if <br/>
a box has a homemade stamp or logbook. We just post and have fun. :)<br/>

How many groups are going to be made, how many times are we going to fragment ourselves into smaller and smaller groups because we took what someone said without a grain of salt?<br/>
<br/>
Truthfully, I grow tired of the repetition. Every group that I have ever been involved in has had the same growing pains, the same troubles, the same responses to posts, etc, ect, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I personally, and this is my opinion, not anyone else's, nor is it meant in anyway to influence anyone else, nor make fun of their own opinions (Standard Disclaimers apply (Go ahead, laugh, it can't hurt that bad!)) am not going to join any more letterboxing groups of purists that have had enough with whoever or whatever on the current lists.  A search at Yahoo of 'letterbox' returns 24 groups and a search of 'letterboxing' returns 15 groups.<br/>
<br/>
I belong to the National list and the regional list for the area I reside in.  That's enough for me.<br/>
