I have no idea where one would have to insert a carriage return in order to have the <br/>

Well I'm glad to hear that it's not just me.  Obviously it must not bother me as much <br/>
when I read OTHER people's posts since I'd never noticed it happening to anyone else.    <br/>
I'll try to make a real point in the future to put in manual carriage returns, but for this <br/>
one I just HAVE to try unchecking that line wrap box that I'd never actually noticed <br/>
before.<br/>
