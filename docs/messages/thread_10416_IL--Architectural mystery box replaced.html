ARCHITECTURAL MYSTERY BOX <br/>
Somewhere in the Chicago suburbs, Cook County, Illinois<br/>
Accessible by public transportation (CTA or Metra)<br/>
Easy, great for families. No poison ivy. No snakes. <br/>
Box: not a mini, but maybe a tiny. You can use a stamp up to about 1" <br/>
across.<br/>
Placed October 6, 2002, by yooperann wfisher47@attbi.com, replaced <br/>
1/20/03  <br/>
<br/>
In 1898 the man who would become the world's most famous architect <br/>
established his first studio in his home in this leafy suburb. Before <br/>
he left town for more famous studios in Wisconsin and Arizona, he <br/>
designed more than 25 buildings, leaving the town an architectural <br/>
legacy that draws tens of thousands of visitors every year. <br/>
One of the architect's most beautiful buildings, only a block away <br/>
from the Home and Studio, is the Frank W. Thomas House, built in <br/>
1901. Across the street from the Thomas House is this town's only <br/>
statue of this famous son. Although the architect was very short (and <br/>
unappreciative owners of his buildings sometimes complained that <br/>
doors and ceilings were built more to his height than to theirs) it <br/>
still hardly seems fair that the bust is set in a rock only about <br/>
three feet off the ground. Your search for the letterbox begins with <br/>
this statue.<br/>
Just to the right of the statue a wrought iron gate leads into a <br/>
park. Go into the park and take the path to your right. Follow the <br/>
path past the wildflower gardens. You will come to a majestic tree, <br/>
of the species obvious for the community (and no, it's not a gingko). <br/>
The tree rises five or six feet from a huge trunk, and then divides <br/>
into two before continuing skyward.  Near this tree you'll find a <br/>
bench. Have a seat and admire the tree. When you're ready to <br/>
continue, turn around and locate the light pole immediately behind <br/>
the bench. You might think the letterbox would be under the base of <br/>
the light pole, but you'd be wrongthat's where it used to be and <br/>
where it disappeared.  So instead cast your gaze further north to yet <br/>
another bench and a light pole near that bench.  That scrunched up <br/>
New York Times bag under that light pole?  Don't just assume it's <br/>
trash.  <br/>
	Please be very discreet removing and replacing the box.  <br/>

Sounds like a neat hunt and I am a fan of that architect's work ... even if he was a crabby old man.<br/>
<br/>
We will be up there in the next year ... hope the box holds out that long!!!<br/>
