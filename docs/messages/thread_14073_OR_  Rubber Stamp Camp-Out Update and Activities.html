Camp-Out this coming weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Also...If you have letterboxes that you have planted at Milo McIver Park<br/>
prior to the gathering, please print off lots of copies of the  clues<br/>
and bring them along.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
A. Rose has bestowed upon me some fine gathering items that will be<br/>
making an appearance!  <br/>
<br/>
First off, her roving event stamp that was debuted last year at the<br/>
August 2002 Pacific NW Gathering will join us.  You may use this event<br/>
stamp to stamp into your logbook.  The logbook for this stamp, however,<br/>
only allows the event stamp in it.   <br/>
<br/>
A little birdie told me we'll be having a gathering stamp from<br/>
SpringChick in Michigan gracing us with its presence. Once the event<br/>
stamp is stamped in, attendees may also stamp into its logbook.<br/>
<br/>
The Hammerin' Hank hitchhiker is rumored to be set free in a letterbox<br/>
within the gathering vicinity so be on the lookout for him and his<br/>
mechanical bull this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
And...Just when you thought she was jailed and it was safe to attend a<br/>
letterboxing gathering again you find it just ain't so.  That's right,<br/>
folks...The infamous K-Martha has made her way West once again.  Be sure<br/>
to get her personal stamp in your letterboxing journal this weekend!<br/>
<br/>
