Larrabee became Washington's first state park in 1915 and is <br/>
officially named in honor of Charles Xavier Larrabee.  The Larrabee <br/>
family donated 20 acres of land to the state for the specific purpose <br/>
of developing a park.  <br/>
Larrabee State Park is a 2,683-acre camping park with 8,100 feet of <br/>
saltwater shoreline on Samish Bay near Bellingham in northwest <br/>
Washington. The park features two freshwater lakes, coves and <br/>
tidelands. Sunsets are gorgeous. A variety of non-motorized, multiple-<br/>
use trails wind through the park.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Located six miles south of Bellingham, WA on the state's northwestern <br/>
side.<br/>
