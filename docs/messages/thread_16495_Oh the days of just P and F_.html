H is included in F<br/>
A is included in F (Found before adopted, - when adopted before <br/>
found, you'll have to find it to tend to it - it would then count as <br/>
F.)<br/>
<br/>
T, E, X, still remain independent counts - <br/>
but I believe should be a subset of F - because you had to come <br/>
across or 'find' them somehow.<br/>
<br/>
P, of course, I'll only count if I had a part in making AND hiding AND<br/>
clue-ing the box.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't it be nice to go back to just P and F?<br/>
Then I'd simply be P5-F123<br/>
<br/>
However - until an 'Official' ruling is made, and to keep as <br/>
undisputed an F count as possible, I will refrain from that <br/>
philosophy and count only F's and H's in my F total. That means three <br/>
more to F100.<br/>

<br/>
Love the name BTW.  You know there is some merit to what you say...<br/>
<br/>
Personally I would agree with counting HH's as F's and P's depending <br/>
on whether you found or planted....<br/>
<br/>
I would agree about the A counts -- seems a little redundant to me.<br/>
<br/>
I however sort of disagree with E's and X's <br/>
<br/>
-- I don't think you get a find for showing up at an event where they <br/>
just hand you a stamp. <br/>
<br/>
-- The idea of "finding" exchanges makes me think of playing hide and <br/>
go seek.<br/>
<br/>
I also count T's for Travelers - I didn't "find" anything I just <br/>
opened my mail box and there it was.  I *could see counting them as <br/>
Hitchhikers* but then you would still need a HH count because they <br/>
would not all be *finds* either.<br/>
<br/>
I bet the Lizard counts and Snake counts really annoy you huh <giggle><br/>
<br/>
I don't do it, but hey I think it's sort of cute.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a new count starting though -- I've categorized it as <br/>
a "FT" - "Fair Trade" -- It is something WarriorWoman and I started - <br/>
sort of a letterboxing by proxy sort of thing.  She goes boxing on <br/>
the Right Coast and I go boxing on the Left Coast, and since neither <br/>
of us will probably ever hit the other coast we swap back and forth <br/>
on a one for one basis and count them as Fair Trades -- doesn't <br/>
effect our "F" count cause that would be cheating, and everyone would <br/>
freak, but also lets us see the images we would never get a chance to <br/>
see.<br/>

Hello TeamGreenDragon --<br/>
<br/>
Okay so before the war on this topic starts let me first say that <br/>
while I can understand your strong feelings about this, and will <br/>
totally defend your right to have those strong feelings, and to <br/>
disagree with what I am doing.... I am not "publishing" anything.  To <br/>
publish something would be to make it public and this is just some <br/>
friendly exchanging going on between friends.  Secondly WarriorWoman, <br/>
who either owns the letterbox or has visited it herself, is visiting <br/>
these boxes.  I'm sorry but I really do not see anything wrong in <br/>
what we are doing and honestly it is really no different than if I <br/>
sat down at a table with Iron`Bear and looked through his log book or <br/>
him mine, since we don't have all the same boxes.  I'm sorry the <br/>
whole thing at all offends you, I do understand feeling strongly and <br/>
passionately about something, thankfully however sometimes we can <br/>
just agree to disagree.  I personally think that in the case of re-<br/>
transmitting -- I may be way off, but I am taking transmitting to <br/>
mean e-mailing- scanning images- posting them on your own website, <br/>
and so on and so forth, not some friends innocently swapping and <br/>
sharing adventures and images back and forth through US Mail.<br/>
<br/>
It's okay though, I can see the flame war coming now -- let me just <br/>
get my nomex suit on first guys okay??<br/>

Oh, brother.  I read Pandora's Dilemma in What's New.  I don't have <br/>
postal letterboxes.  But I do have planted boxes.  So far, I have <br/>
sent Pandora one set of 3x5 index cards with my signature stamp image <br/>
and my own letterboxes stamp images on them.<br/>
<br/>
So, technically, I haven't broken any rules.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm about to, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't publish".  I'm not publishing anything anywhere online or in <br/>
book form for the masses to see.  I'm sending a 3x5 index card to one <br/>
individual.<br/>
<br/>
"Re-Transmit".  Okay, define this for me.  "Transmit" evokes images <br/>
of technology, like a .jpg in an email that could be easily forwarded <br/>
to every computer in the world.  I'm sending a 3x5 index card, <br/>
nonreproducible, to one individual by US mail.<br/>
<br/>
If the webmasters saw fit to publish Pandora's plea in the What's New <br/>
section of the official website, what do you think the average <br/>
letterboxer who reads it will do?  Get creative!<br/>
<br/>
Now, you guys know me, you've met me on a number of occasions.  Do <br/>
you *really* think I'm out here deliberately trying to do something <br/>
wrong, on purpose, to say "neener neener" to the spirit of <br/>
letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
I will post to all letterbox placers in the MA and RI area that if <br/>
they do *not* want me to letterbox by proxy their letterbox images to <br/>
Pandora, I will abide by their individual decisions.<br/>

We at Team Rayvenhaus use the following:<br/>
<br/>
P = Planted. Boxes we have personally created, carved and placed.<br/>
A = Adopted.  Boxes that someone else created that we first found (Counting as a F count) and then took over as the maintainer if it was/is abandoned.<br/>
F = Found.  Boxes that we have researched the clues on, gone hiking to find and have personally found planted in their original location. Not traded or passed on, nothing else.<br/>
X = Exchanged. Personal signature stamps that belong to another letterboxer. Each unique signature stamp counts as a 'X'. And why not? It's a stamp image, no?<br/>
E = Events.  These are Event stamps. If the stamp is designated as an event stamp by the creator, then they count as an Event. Since I am not independently wealthy and can not get to events from coast to coast, I consider myself lucky to have a chance to 'capture' these otherwise 'uncatchable images for my log book.<br/>
HH = Hitchhiker stamp. How they came to us, matters not, if they are designated as a Hitchhiker by the creator, then they count as a Hitchhiker and not in any other category.<br/>
T = Travelers. These are fairly simple as well. If they are traveling, moving from place to place and are NOT designated as a Hitchhiker by the creator, they are a Traveler.<br/>
<br/>
SNL and PL are a personal set of numbers only.<br/>
<br/>
We, as Team Rayvenhaus, have some other personal, significant numbers that we keep track of, and to be truthful, the simple fact that people have taken the time to write to me and, for lack of a better term, gripe about these 'other' numbers, telling me how silly it is to do so, and one to even mention that I was very rude for trying to 'force' others to add unneeded numbers to their counts, is a waste of time on their parts.  The numbers that I use, that are for MY personal usage, are just that. Mine. Not yours, nor am I advocating that you or anyone else must adopt this way of counting or these 'extra' numbers.  Count the way you want to count. It's as simple as that.  <br/>
<br/>
Please don't get upset by my words. I'm not trying to dictate anything to anyone.  I'm just sharing what I do with the group and have one goal in mind and, not, it's not to be the Kahn of Letterboxing (grin), it's to simply have fun at this hobby.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to meeting you all on the trail one day.<br/>

  P, of course, I'll only count if I had a part in making AND hiding AND<br/>
  clue-ing the box.<br/>
<br/>
  Wouldn't it be nice to go back to just P and F?<br/>
  Then I'd simply be P5-F123<br/>
<br/>
  However - until an 'Official' ruling is made, and to keep as <br/>
  undisputed an F count as possible, I will refrain from that <br/>
  philosophy and count only F's and H's in my F total. That means three <br/>
  more to F100.<br/>

You provided me with valuable information.  You took the time to <br/>
research and give me this information.  For this, I thank you.  And I <br/>
have followed up on this information by doing a public post to all MA <br/>
and RI letterbox placers.  And I will abide by their individual <br/>
decisions.<br/>

Thank you for writing such a humble note to the group and to me.  I <br/>
am always truly impressed by Men that can admit faults and stand up <br/>
and say "Hey I'm sorry I was wrong".  I admire such traits.  It says <br/>
a lot more than beating someone over the head with your ways of doing <br/>
things and haranguing them for their personal opinions.  You have my <br/>
gratitude and appreciation.  <br/>
<br/>
Since I have not been out on the trails to do this Fair Trade thing, <br/>
I will also follow WarriorWoman's example and make a post to all OR <br/>
and WA letter boxers offering the same courtesy and I too thank you <br/>
for bringing your opinion to our attention.<br/>
<br/>
The wonderful thing about opinions and suggestions is that we can <br/>
hear them, and take them into consideration before we do something.  <br/>
Then choose to act on them or not.  I will act on yours as I would <br/>
never want to offend or upset those that have been wonderful enough <br/>
to plant letterboxes for me to go find.  I think sometimes it is all <br/>
in presentation, and I thank you for the way you handled this.<br/>

<br/>
Hey Warrior Woman, you've got my vote.  Please me share a bit of my philosophy here....<br/>
<br/>
Why do I carve stamps and plant letterboxes?<br/>
<br/>
Several reasons.<br/>
<br/>
The first reason is to return to this hobby in kind. In other words, if I don't plant any, no one else can enjoy more letterboxes. I look at it as a catalyst. Creating more boxes by creating more boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Second is because I want, as most people want, others to appreciate my work, to comment on it.  I don't create the to hide them and refuse to let others see them.  Does the fact that someone might take an image of a stamp that I made and send it to someone that couldn't get to it bother me? Nope.  What of the groups that letterbox together? Do they always work as a group and everyone does their part in finding the stamp, or does, from time to time, one or two get 'carried' along and get  a stamp they might not have found themselves?<br/>
<br/>
I certainly have better things to worry about concerning my letterboxes than whether or not someone get an image of the stamp without actually expending the physical energy to locate the place of the boxes hiding.<br/>
<br/>
I for one see it as a chance for more people to see my work and either hate it or appreciate it. More the last than the first I hope.  (Grin)<br/>
