for anyone coming from out of the area for the May Day Gather in <br/>
Connecticut. I carved this personal event stamp in honor of the <br/>
Nipmuc indians,whose ancient fishing grounds were located at the <br/>
gathering's location. To receive this stamp, tell me the name of the <br/>
Nipmuc indian chief killed in 1619. This stamp will be altered after <br/>
the event and planted as an ongoing box for all to search for.<br/>
