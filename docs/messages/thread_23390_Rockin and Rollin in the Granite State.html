                    <div class="plaintext-content">So i have come up with a plan for my blogsite. Every Tuesday, i will <br/>
be posting a new location in New Hampshire in a segment i <br/>
call "rockin and rollin in the granite state." My plan is to bring <br/>
people to places throughout the state that no one has ever thought <br/>
about going to or just can't. i will give a little bit of history <br/>
about the town and list boxes in the area. it is my hopes that it <br/>
could/will draw some attention to our wonderful part of the country <br/>
and maybe bring some visitors. i hope that everyone enjoys this <br/>
segment and others i have planned for my blogsite. thanks.<br/>
<br/>
monday through sunday - team new hampshire boxing review<br/>
