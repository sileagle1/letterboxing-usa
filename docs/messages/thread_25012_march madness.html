Not sure if there are any letterboxers who are college<br/>
basketball fans or not.  If so, I will be running a<br/>
college basketball pool for pride, a chance to get hints<br/>
to my boxes, and possibly other stuff, with one of those<br/>
online bracket manager thingies.  (And besides, in my<br/>
office, both the boss and staff are morons, so we can't<br/>
have one).<br/>
<br/>
If you want to play, e-mail me (the way it works is that<br/>
I have to invite people by e-mail address) by March 17<br/>
(picks can be entered anytime between the evening of<br/>
Mar 15th thru noon Mar 19th).<br/>
<br/>
I'll do this, I guess, if I get at least 5 people who want<br/>
to do it.  Here is some info below --<br/>
<br/>
==========================================================================<br/>
<br/>
For every 5 players who sign up, I will offer a mapsurfer <br/>
letterboxing-related prize (up to three such prizes).  The prizes will <br/>
be a WOM clue, a "big hint" on one of my boxes, and a yes/no question on <br/>
one of my boxes (all expiring 4/30/09).<br/>
<br/>
Others can offer prizes if they want to as well (just e-mail me or post <br/>
the the LbNA list).  Since most of my boxes are in the Mid-Atlantic <br/>
region, and most (including, I imagine, many of those in the <br/>
Mid-Atlantic region) are uninterested in them, it would be cool to have <br/>
more or different prizes in other geographies in the unlikely event alot <br/>
of people sign up.<br/>
<br/>
The winner has 24 hours to draft the prize they want from the list of <br/>
any such prizes.  2nd place may then draft, and so on.  I'll probably <br/>
put up a web site of such (in the unlikely event that anyone besides me <br/>
contributes prizes).  I am not responsible for delivery of prizes not <br/>
contributed by me, should any exist.  That is between the claimant and <br/>
contributer (contributer is requested to provide some sort of contact info).<br/>
<br/>
Please don't register more than once.  Please be cool.  While it is <br/>
trivial to game the system, please don't.  I reserve the right to change <br/>
the rules as I feel like.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, like everything free in this world, there is a cost.  If I win, <br/>
everyone who enters has to send me a hand-carved stamp.  (Just sort of <br/>
kidding, but it would be cool, wouldn't it).<br/>

Not sure if there are any letterboxers who are college<br/>
basketball fans or not.  If so, I will be running a<br/>
college basketball pool for pride, a chance to get hints<br/>
to my boxes, and possibly other stuff, with one of those<br/>
online bracket manager thingies.  (And besides, in my<br/>
office, both the boss and staff are morons, so we can't<br/>
have one).<br/>
<br/>
If you want to play, e-mail me (the way it works is that<br/>
I have to invite people by e-mail address) by March 17<br/>
(picks can be entered anytime between the evening of<br/>
Mar 15th thru noon Mar 19th).<br/>
<br/>
I'll do this, I guess, if I get at least 5 people who want<br/>
to do it.  Here is some info below --<br/>
<br/>
==========================================================================<br/>
<br/>
For every 5 players who sign up, I will offer a mapsurfer <br/>
letterboxing-related prize (up to three such prizes).  The prizes will <br/>
be a WOM clue, a "big hint" on one of my boxes, and a yes/no question<br/>
on <br/>
one of my boxes (all expiring 4/30/09).<br/>
<br/>
Others can offer prizes if they want to as well (just e-mail me or post <br/>
the the LbNA list).  Since most of my boxes are in the Mid-Atlantic <br/>
region, and most (including, I imagine, many of those in the <br/>
Mid-Atlantic region) are uninterested in them, it would be cool to have <br/>
more or different prizes in other geographies in the unlikely event alot <br/>
of people sign up.<br/>
<br/>
The winner has 24 hours to draft the prize they want from the list of <br/>
any such prizes.  2nd place may then draft, and so on.  I'll probably <br/>
put up a web site of such (in the unlikely event that anyone besides me <br/>
contributes prizes).  I am not responsible for delivery of prizes not <br/>
contributed by me, should any exist.  That is between the claimant and <br/>
contributer (contributer is requested to provide some sort of contact info).<br/>
<br/>
Please don't register more than once.  Please be cool.  While it is <br/>
trivial to game the system, please don't.  I reserve the right to change <br/>
the rules as I feel like.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, like everything free in this world, there is a cost.  If I win, <br/>
everyone who enters has to send me a hand-carved stamp.  (Just sort of <br/>
kidding, but it would be cool, wouldn't it).<br/>

<br/>
You have to at least know what a bracket is, and how to fill one out :)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, there are about 25 or so people who have responded.  I'll be<br/>
sending  the invites out this weekend, so if you are thinking about<br/>
it, it would be helpful if I knew before then, although people can<br/>
always be added later (I think, anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Also, being a Villanova fan for the last 30 years, we will be<br/>
instituting a new rule.  Anyone who picks "UConn", or other Big<br/>
East schools, to win it all, will be ineligible for prizes.  Since<br/>
I don't think there is much interest in my southern New England<br/>
boxes, this should not be too big a restriction (ok, only kidding :-))<br/>
<br/>
