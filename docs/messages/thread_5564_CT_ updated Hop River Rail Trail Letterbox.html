<p>The trail runs along the East side of <i>Bolton Notch Pond</i>, then under 
the junctions of Routes 6, 44 and <b>I</b>384 in Bolton Notch. A commuter 
parking lot is located off of Routes 6 and 44, next to the old Drive In movie 
theater near the <b>I</b>384 entrance ramp. At the back right corner of the 
parking lot, you will find a path that leads you to the rear of the old movie 
screen. Here, take a right until you run into the old Drive In theaters 
entrance road and go left. You will come upon a sign on your right reading 
<i>Freja Park</i>. This trail will take you around <i>Bolton Notch</i>
<i>Pond</i> to the junction of Valley Falls and Hop River Rail Trails. Be sure 
to follow the green arrows along the path, as there are many side trails. This 
path is only about a  mile long, but hilly.</p><b>
</b><p>To start at Bailey Road in Andover:</p>
<p>Take Route 6 past Andover Center towards Bolton and make a left onto Bailey 
Road. This road is located directly across from the road to the <i>Channel 3 
Country Camp</i>. Where the road turns from paved to gravel is where the trail 
crosses over. Park here and take the trail South towards Andover Center.</p><b>
</b><p>To start at Kings Road in Columbia:</p>
<p>Take Route 66 to Flanders Road (located between Route 6/66 junction and 
Willimantic, near the U-haul rental business). Take a Left down Kings Road and 
park by the yellow gate at the start of the trail.</p></dir></dir></dir></dir>
<p>The <b>Hop River Rail Trail</b> is part of an old abandoned railroad bed that 
goes from Willimantic to Bolton, where it becomes the <b>Valley</b> <b>Falls 
Rail Trail</b> and goes into Vernon, with a spur into Rockville (see 
<b>Rockville Spur Letterbox</b>). The Valley Falls section consists of stone 
dust, while the <i>Hop River</i> section is stone dust and crushed stone with 
occasional sections of trap rock (left over from the railroad beds). A lot of 
new work has taken place along the <i>Hop River</i> section; new bridges, new 
stone dust installed and new drainage, so I find more improvements every time I 
ride it. Along the trails you will see plenty of reminders of its history, such 
as old telephone poles, old railroad ties and an occasional old granite whistle 
stop marker (big <i>W</i> carved into the stone). <b>In Bolton</b>, you have an 
opportunity to collect two additional Letterboxes. Check out the <b>Valley Falls 
Rail Trail Letterbox</b> for its reference to <i>Freja Park</i> and just two 
miles down the Valley Falls trail, is the trailhead to the <b>Valley Falls 
Letterbox</b>. </p>
<p>Take the trail to the right alongside <i>Bolton Notch Pond</i> and soon 
youll be passing through a tunnel underneath <b>I</b>384. You emerge in a rock 
lined gorge that soon gives way to steep drops on both sides of the trail. You 
go alongside a hilly ridge with Route 6 below in the distance. Most of this 
section is all new stone dust. You cross over <b>Bailey Road</b> at about the 4 
mile mark. After about 4  miles the trail detours around an old railroad bridge 
of iron rails over a stone embankment. This bridge is currently being rebuilt. 
After you reach the other side, youll notice how the stones form steps down the 
embankment. Walk down the steps to the bottom, turn around and find your prize 
hidden beneath the stones. Back on the trail, you may continue onwards. You pass 
by the <i>Andover Fin, Fur &amp; Feather Club</i> along the left. You then cross 
over Burnap Brook Road. Here, you can take a quick side trip down to <i>Burnap 
Brook</i>. A beautiful brook, flowing through a scenic gorge, which then flows 
through an old stone tunnel underneath the rail trail. Just take the trail to 
the right, after you cross over the road. After about 6  miles the trail runs 
parallel to Route 6 and your in <b>Andover Center</b>. You pass through the 
parking area of <i>Protech Services</i> <i>Center</i> and will come to a halt 
above Route 316 where the bridge was removed. If you wish, you can continue on 
to Columbia, at an additional 7 miles. You can go down the steep embankment or 
take a detour around it from the <i>Protech Services</i> parking area. Center 
Street is next to the <i>Protech</i> parking lot. You may also park at the end 
of Center Street to access the trail. Head down Center Street to Route 316 and 
cross over. You can access the trail behind the old <i>Andover Town Hall</i> 
along Route 6. There is a brand new tunnel that passes underneath Route 6, as 
well as many new bridges built along this section. After about 8 miles, you will 
finally see the <i>Hop River</i> along your left. Theres a couple of short 
sections with some rough trap rock, but forge ahead, because you pass through a 
beautiful area with the <i>Hop River</i> on your left and a scenic pond on your 
right. The trail then crosses over a wide section of the Hop River after about 
10  miles. This is a brand new bridge that was completed in the spring of 2002, 
using the original iron trestle as its base. After about 12 miles youll pass 
through a gravel pit that has filled in with water. We spotted about a dozen 
wild turkeys off in the underbrush. You pass underneath the Route 6 expressway 
and at about the 13 mile point you come across two sets of power transmission 
lines. If you look to your right you can see the <i>Hop River</i> and Route 66. 
Between the two sets of transmission lines, you will notice an old railroad 
telephone pole on your right. Pass by this pole and go to the next pole up on a 
small ridge. Take a compass reading of 130 degrees and look behind the large oak 
tree. Under a pile of rocks is the prize you seek. The trail continues on for 
another  mile until you come to <b>Kings Road</b>. Another bridge crosses over 
the<i> Hop River</i>, but, as of this date it is not passable.
