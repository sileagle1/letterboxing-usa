Mohmer's, thanks for adding the extra fun of letterboxes to a trip to <br/>
the ST Louis zoo.  We had a good time on Sat 9/1/01 at the zoo.  We <br/>
only found 2 out of the five boxes.  Being new at this and needing <br/>
two tries at the Turtle park box, I dare not say that I think they're <br/>
missing!  We found Teddy and Close it tight.  We really think we were <br/>
in the right spots for the others, but couldn't find them.  I'll wait <br/>
to hear if someone else finds them. <br/>
I hope to find Lettercacher's Letterbox before we move.  I've tried <br/>
twice (dodging golf carts and golfballs) so far, even did research <br/>
and found better maps before the second attempt. <br/>
I also want to get a few of your boxes in IL before we move.  I hope <br/>
to have enough time to squeeze more letterboxing in while packing up.<br/>

  Glad you had fun at the zoo!  ROAR! &amp;  RAJA  have been the hardest to find <br/>
for other boxers so far too.  Don't feel bad.  :o)  The Longest Neck's <br/>
location was the most precarious but all were there the last I heard.   If <br/>
you check out the geoaching page for comments from other hunters, that might <br/>
help next time.  We'd be happy to give you any help off list.  :o) <br/>
  When we found LetterCachers box we had to use the clues.  They lead you <br/>
away from the lagoon!  We didn't have to cross the golf course at all. I <br/>
think I'm safe to say that much.  :o)<br/>
  Hope to see you in the parks in IL, my kids would love to exchange stamp <br/>
marks!!<br/>
