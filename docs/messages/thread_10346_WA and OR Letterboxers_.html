                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey you guys. I was just out to Washougal and Skamania (along the<br/>
Washington side of the Columbia River Gorge) today and found two<br/>
GORGEOUS letterboxes. Easy, drive-by boxes and they have been there<br/>
since November. <br/>
<br/>
I was the FIRST person to sign in!!<br/>
<br/>
I could not believe it! You guys should RUN NOT WALK out to get these<br/>
boxes tomorrow.  Alaska Bound and Tundra Traveler. They are very much<br/>
worth your while....and Alaska Bound is supposed to leave in the<br/>
Spring for Alaska, so you should really make an effort to get it soon. <br/>
<br/>
Or not, you know there are no rules and I wouldn't want to tell you<br/>
what to do or anything :-)<br/>
