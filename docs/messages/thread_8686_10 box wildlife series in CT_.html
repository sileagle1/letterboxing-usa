                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow been busy,we were going to put out a 9 box wildlife series but changed it to a 10 box series.they will all be spread thru out the Connecticut Audubon at the Bafflin Nature Sanctuary in Pomfret CT.they will mostly be on separate trails but they're not all out yet, but i will post the three that are you can either go stamp them or wait until they are all out.hopefully we will be done by sunday,between work and every day life time is of the essence.sorry no horses or motercycles allowed but i checked and dogs are.trails are open sun up until sun down. we hope you all will enjoy the beautiful country side.Lenny/Kathy<br/>
