Accotink Park, Fairfax County<br/>
Annandale, VA<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Park has a lake and lots of people fishing.  This looks like a popular spot<br/>
for the mountain bikers and hikers as well.  I also noticed the birds are<br/>
loud and leave generous droppings, so watch out.<br/>
<br/>
The access road to the park is on the old railroad bed (called right-of-way<br/>
or ROW for short) for the Orange &amp; Alexandria Railroad (now Norfolk Southern<br/>
RR).  Today the railroad runs on the tall trestle bridge next to the dam.  I<br/>
saw an westbound Amtrak train cross it at 11:21 AM Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
Start on the trail in front of the dam and head west.<br/>
The trail goes around the lake so this will be "clockwise".  You will pass<br/>
counter-clockwise milepost (MP) 3.5.  At clockwise MP.5, bear right at<br/>
intersection with Carrleigh Parkway Entrance Trail.  Proceed past a single<br/>
section split rail fence on the right.  When you come to a five section<br/>
split rail fence, take the next trail on the left (approx 130 degrees) for<br/>
about 25 steps.  This should put you on a small ridge relative to the trail<br/>
you turned from.  Straight ahead you can see present NS RR tracks (in<br/>
winter).  From there look at about 280 degrees for a level path along the<br/>
top of the ridge and proceed.  You are on the old O&amp;A Railroad right-of-way<br/>
(ROW) called a "fill" in RR terms.  It is constructed with earth removed<br/>
from "cuts".  Cuts are man-made valleys dug through natural ridges to allow<br/>
a level path for the railroad.  As you proceed on this fill, you can look<br/>
ahead to see the approaching cut.  At the end of the fill, go down the very<br/>
steep bank on the right (or back-track) to the main trail.  Continue through<br/>
the cut.  You should pass a three section split rail fence and<br/>
counter-clockwise MP 3.  After the cut look for a dip in the otherwise level<br/>
ROW.  From the dip head 240 degrees for 80 steps, (again you can see the<br/>
active railroad in winter) looking for the first noticeable valley on the<br/>
left.  Proceed up the valley past a tree with moss on its trunk.  Look past<br/>
the fallen tree and see an old lawn mower looking thingy.  Go back to the<br/>
moss tree and then head 295-300 degrees for 13 steps.  Look in the hollow<br/>
tree trunk, covered with leaves, bark and twigs.<br/>
