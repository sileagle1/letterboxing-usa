the means of ordinary web surfers to repair so if anyone needs/wants <br/>
to contact me please use mccoys1988@yahoo.com for the email address.  <br/>
I hope you all are getting in some successful boxin' over the holiday <br/>
weekend.  CardinalMom,the kids, and I spent Thursday planting some <br/>
new boxes in a formerly box free area of southern Ohio.  Friday we <br/>
started out with high hopes but were able to locate and stamp in on <br/>
only 2 of the 6 boxes we attempted before being defeated by the <br/>
brutal July heat and humidity.  Some days you get the bear and some <br/>
days the bear gets you.<br/>
