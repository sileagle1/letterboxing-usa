Planted by The NeeDeeps 3-15-03<br/>
Hi this is the very first box planted from our State Stamp collection.On<br/>
the Ct. state quarter it features a charter oak so we thought it would<br/>
only be fitting to plant this box near one.On south st. in Coventry go<br/>
past the Hale homestead,down the road a little more is the Strong Porter<br/>
House directly across the street is the place to pull in and park.The<br/>
same starting place as some of the best Letterboxes around like Charter<br/>
oak's Great Grandson,Women of the Revolutionary War and Pumped up. After<br/>
you park your car walk down the trail soon you will see a stone wall on<br/>
your right,follow the wall until it comes to a corner.Take a moment to<br/>
look at the big charter oak off to your right.Now on your left you will<br/>
notice that there is another stone wall that also came to a corner,in<br/>
the corner of the stonewall on your left behind a stone door is the<br/>
CT.State Stamp.please rehide well.The NeeDeeps  <br/>
