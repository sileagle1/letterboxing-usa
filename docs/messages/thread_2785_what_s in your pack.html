                    <div class="plaintext-content">We pack some extra items, although not essential, they can make the<br/>
hike a little more enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
1) A pocket knife - If you need one, YOU NEED ONE.<br/>
<br/>
2) A small lightweight camera - We love to take pictures <br/>
   of the beautiful sites and interesting things we pass along<br/>
   the trail.  We use a very lightweight digital camera so we can<br/>
   transfer the images to our computer. <br/>
<br/>
3) A small foldable pair of field glasses - I love wildlife and<br/>
   have spotted some interesting birds along flyways and such.<br/>
<br/>
4) An extra pair of reading glasses - Well, they're lightweight and<br/>
   if something happens to the original ones, you'll be hard pressed<br/>
   to read that compass won't ya.<br/>
<br/>
5) A pocket tissue packet -  If nature calls along the way, and <br/>
   you're not prepared, well, you know what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
6) A glove - we carry one leather glove for reaching up into those<br/>
   out of way places like tree stumps.  You never know what critter<br/>
   likes to snuggle up to your letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I don't know much about them and if we should carry one - a<br/>
snakebite kit.  Is this something I should know more about in New<br/>
England?<br/>
