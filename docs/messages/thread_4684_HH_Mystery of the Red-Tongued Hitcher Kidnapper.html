Sorry,folks - this is not a mystery box, but another hitcher story. <br/>
Delete if necessary.  Hopefully, however, telling this story will <br/>
explain some of the recent bad karma in our area and will clear the <br/>
air of those remaining noxious little fumes!<br/>
<br/>
Just about a month ago, when hitcher complaints first surfaced on-<br/>
line, little red faced stamps with tongues sticking out and the <br/>
words "the Hitchhiker Kidnapper strikes again HAHAHA!" began popping <br/>
out at some of our boxes. Since we already knew that the person who <br/>
started the complaining had found and taken 3 hitchers from our boxes <br/>
in December, when 3 red-tongued hitcher kidnapper faces appeared at <br/>
several other of our boxes on Feb.15th, and the very next day, we got <br/>
a report of that person finding 6 hitchers at her last 10 boxes, we <br/>
assumed we had found our red-tongued culprit!<br/>
<br/>
Well, so much for assumptions.  We feel just terrible that now it <br/>
turns out we may have been suspecting the wrong person all along!<br/>
We also feel terrible that people we had formerly trusted have <br/>
apparently been willing to let someone else take the rap for their <br/>
own intentionally nasty behavior for almost a month now! At least <br/>
when WE make a mistake or unwittingly hurt someone else's feelings, <br/>
we try to make a correction or explanation as soon as possible!<br/>
I guess, despite undergraduate degrees in psychology and human <br/>
services, certain aspects of human nature will just always remain <br/>
puzzling to me!(I suppose that's why I don't work in those fields!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm glad that this whole red-tongued episode has turned out <br/>
to be not something truly pathological, as we had feared, but more on <br/>
the order of garden variety resentment or jealousy. Now perhaps we <br/>
can get back to putting out the Burlingame area boxes we had felt <br/>
obliged to temporarily remove, and to cleaning up some of the trash <br/>
deposited recently near some of our box sites. Sorry that this recent <br/>
vandalism has already unfortunately affected quite a few folks. We'll <br/>
let you know when the problems seem to have been resolved.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, we're off to the "sunny land of no letterboxes" for our <br/>
annual desert hiking expedition. Hopefully, when we return, the <br/>
climate here will have improved as well, and we can get back to <br/>
updating all those joyful travelers!<br/>
