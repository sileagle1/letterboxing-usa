"Hot in Idaho"<br/>
We were all sweating from the HEAT of the day.  Thanks to all who <br/>
joined us from near and far.  <br/>
Silver Eagle, Baby Bear, CW Sunseeker and Jazmine Girl, Lori Darlin <br/>
and Kelly &amp; Alex joined J&amp;A-Bear....of course we only had a few <br/>
sightings of J-Bear since we weren't fishing.  <br/>
I LOVE meeting other letterboxers and hearing about everybody's <br/>
adventures.  =-)  Thanks again.<br/>

See you on the trail and keep the boxes coming.<br/>

a few days ago and I wanted to thank A &amp; J-Bear for hosting<br/>
this event.  It was great getting to meet other boxers and<br/>
find a few of their letterboxes.  I was very impressed with<br/>
the Boise area and Idaho in general, so if you have a chance<br/>
to go, I highly recommend it.  And be sure to let A-Bear know;<br/>
she is a very gracious host!<br/>
