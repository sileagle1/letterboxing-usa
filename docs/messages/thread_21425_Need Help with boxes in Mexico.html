Where (on the LbNA site) are the boxes for Mexico listed? If I click <br/>
on "How Many Boxes are There?" it tells me there are 13 in Mexico but <br/>
won't give me the clues. Am I doing something wrong?<br/>

I thought I already emailed her about how to find them (we're "thinking" of making a diversion to Oaxaca to find her box in early March).<br/>
<br/>
Here's at least one way I know of to find International boxes on letterboxing.org:<br/>
<br/>
1. Go to "Search for Boxes"<br/>
2. Click on "View all Boxes" (near bottom left of page)<br/>
3. Scroll through list to find the country you are looking for.  The countries are listed alphabetically, but are interspersed with the U.S. States.  That means Mexico shows up between Massachusetts and Michigan.<br/>

I'm absolutely no help with the problem but want to say that I just added a box in <br/>
Mexico last week. It shows up in my list of boxes in the 'your letterboxes' link but is <br/>
nowhere to be found using the map or Mexico link on LbNA. This box is hosted on <br/>
Atlas Quest as are three others and can be accessed using that website. Funhog<br/>

Hey, this really works. I never knew that this is where all those <br/>
internatioal boxes were hiding. <br/>
Thanks Wisconsin Hiker, <br/>
