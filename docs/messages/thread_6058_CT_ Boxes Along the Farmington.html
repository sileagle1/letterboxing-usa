<br/>
After spending far-too-many weekends these last couple of months renovating <br/>
the apartment half of my two-family house, I finally treated myself to a <br/>
well-deserved (and productive) Sunday afternoon of letterboxing along two <br/>
segments of the Farmington River in nearby East Granby and Windsor, CT. The <br/>
two "Fun in Spoonville" boxes in East Granby afford great views of the Class <br/>
III rapids favored by experienced area kayakers, while the "Keep on Rollin'" <br/>
and "Bully" boxes along the Windsor Center River Trail offer equally <br/>
picturesque glimpses of the Farmington as it flows leisurely towards its <br/>
confluence with the Connecticut River about a mile away. The clues for each <br/>
pair of boxes are relatively simple and straightforward, the boxes are <br/>
well-hidden (and currently intact!), and each hike I would consider to be <br/>
kid-friendly. <br/>
<br/>
Also highly recommended: a stop at Bart's (diagonally across the street from <br/>
the Windsor Center River Trail) for hot dogs, burgers, fries, and similar <br/>
fare! Bart's is a classic eatery, a local institution; it's the first place <br/>
my boss took me for lunch when I went to work for the Town of Windsor in <br/>
1976, and the last place I ate at before moving on in 1979. If you consider <br/>
yourself a carnivore, be sure to check it out! (But be warned: Bart's is not <br/>
open on Sundays (much to my dismay!).)<br/>
