<br/>
The Fat Dawg, modeled after Rocco, the world's fattest Jack Russell <br/>
terrier was released today to get him some well-needed exercise.  Fat <br/>
Dawg is more of a traveling companion that needs to move from <br/>
letterbox to letterbox in order to shed some fat and become a trim <br/>
dawg.  We could think of now better place to release the Fat Dawg <br/>
than the Bob Rodale Fitness Park in Trexlertown, PA.<br/>
<br/>
Please let Fat Dawg's former owner know his progress and appetite for <br/>
junk food.<br/>
