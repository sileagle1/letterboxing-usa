We were pleasantly surprised to find the Boxcar Hitchhiker at Moore Woods <br/>
(her 5th hostel) on Friday the 13th.  Definitely not bad luck!  She trekked <br/>
all over with us on Saturday before finding a nice cozy spot to stop for a <br/>
while!  She was missing her turquoise stamp, and all we had were brand new <br/>
Crayola markers, so we stuck one of those in.  (We did trials with the <br/>
marker, and it really works quite well...hardly tell the difference!)<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail!<br/>
