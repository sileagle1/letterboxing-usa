<p>The<i> Minuteman Bikeway</i> follows the former route of a railroad line 
between North Cambridge and Bedford. Built in 1846 and extended in 1874, the 
rail line was finally discontinued in 1981. The bikeway was then constructed 
between 1991 and 1993. The 12 foot wide, paved surface is divided by a yellow 
line for its entire length. Road crossings are well marked with signs and 
crosswalks. Starting May 28, 2002, some sections will be repaired near the 
Arlington area and you may encounter some detours. For more information, check 
out the website; <i>www.MinutemanBikeway.org</i> </p><b>
</b><p>Starting in <b>Bedford</b>, be sure to check out the old <i>Bedford Depot 
Freight House,</i> if its open. It has railroad related items and some 
refreshments. Across the street, next to an old<i> Boston &amp; Maine 
Railroad</i> passenger car, is a bike shop. Also from this point, you can access 
the <b><i>Bedford Narrow Gauge Rail Trail Spur</i> Letterbox</b>. From Bedford, 
the trail has a generally, slight uphill grade to Lexington and then a slight 
downhill grade to Arlington. After a couple of miles you cross over <b>I</b>95 
via an old railroad bridge. After 3  miles, spot a grassy area on your left 
with a long granite bench suspended between two rocks. Another rock has a 
memorial dedicated to Albert Lester. To the left is a small path through the 
woods. Go up the path to a sign that reads "Lexington Conservation Land" and 
look to your left. Youll see three large Maple trees in a row. Behind the third 
tree, under some sticks is the prize you seek. This is close to the bike trail, 
so please be discreet. Continuing along the trail, at the 4 mile mark you will 
enter <b>Lexington Center</b> and pass by a Visitors Center and the old<i> 
Lexington Depot</i>. The Depot is currently undergoing some restoration and 
plans call for converting the old "ticket windows" for use selling drinks and 
snacks to trail users. A parking lot is located here. You can take a quick 
detour here to check out the historic sights, such as <i>Lexington Common</i>, 
the site of the first battle of the<i> Revolutionary War</i>. There are also 
shops and restaurants. After 9 miles you reach <b>Arlington Center</b>, where 
the trail takes a detour through town via two crosswalks. The railroad used to 
cross the street at this point and they have preserved some of the old tracks in 
a small park. Shops and restaurants here as well. Another  mile will bring you 
past <i>Spy Pond</i> on your right. You then come to<b> Thorndike Field</b> 
after about 10 miles.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Another  miles will bring you to the <b>Alewife T Station</b>, a stop on the 
commuter rail line into Boston. From here you may take a  mile detour to<b> 
Fresh Pond</b>, where a 2  mile paved trail encircles the pond. This is a 
public water supply area. To reach the pond, go around the station to a large 
metal circle with a <b>T</b> cut out, sitting on the sidewalk. Cross over the 
road at the crosswalk and head straight down the path. This sidewalk brings you 
alongside the Alewife Brook Parkway, which then crosses over a railroad freight 
yard. You come to a traffic circle, which is currently being repaired and cross 
over the road to the right of the circle. Please use caution as the crosswalk is 
currently being installed. Turn left and head down the sidewalk along the 
traffic circle. You will soon come to a right turnoff and the start of the 
<b>Fresh Pond Loop</b>. Following the loop to the right, the pavement is a bit 
old, but navigable. A wire fence encircles the pond and has a lot of poison ivy 
growing up it, so please dont touch. You then encounter a short unpaved 
section. If you look to your right, you will see some old railroad tracks. You 
then come to newly paved asphalt, as the trail brings you around the water 
purification facility. A detour to your left takes you up a small hill into a 
shaded area with two stone overlooks. It then loops back down to the trail. You 
then pass by the <i>Cambridge Water</i> <i>Works</i> building and continue 
around the pond back to where you entered. I was going to plant another 
Letterbox somewhere around the pond, but forgot to bring a second box, so if 
anyone wishes to hide a box here while visiting, Ill be glad to add it to these 
clues.</p>
