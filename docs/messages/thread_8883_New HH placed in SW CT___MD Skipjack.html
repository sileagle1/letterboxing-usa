                    <div class="plaintext-content">We wanted to leave behind a little touch of Maryland's Chesapeake Bay <br/>
on our first Connecticut roadtrip. We spent 2 1/2 busy days in <br/>
beautiful CT, visiting boxes from Danbury to Guilford and many towns <br/>
in between. We totaled 16 new finds. So...in one of those boxes, the <br/>
Maryland Skipjack Hitchhiker has a temporary home. Please help it <br/>
sail along!<br/>
<br/>
Donna (aka Tempus Fugit P2 F41), Claire, Matt and Chuck (without whom <br/>
we wouldn't have been able to lift some of those heavy CT rocks!)<br/>
<br/>
PS: I believe the Lock 12 box is MIA; Celtic Miniature box #2 is <br/>
totally waterlogged and beyond our help; and we found frog "Prince"'s <br/>
personal stamp on a rock by a Guilford box (where we stashed it for <br/>
you to collect)<br/>
