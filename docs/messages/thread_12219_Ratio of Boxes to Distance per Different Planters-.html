this sport continues to grow, the number of boxes do too...<br/>
<br/>
Well, with the recent small ink in BP magazine and the possibility of <br/>
a book going into print on Letterboxing, it now seems to me that <br/>
things may begin to get hairy. (I believe I even heard mention of <br/>
letterboxing or geocaching [one] on the talk show Sunday Morning on <br/>
CBS this past winter) The number of boxes we may wish to plant in any <br/>
one area may be put into question.<br/>
<br/>
For instance , my first plants were in a very small park.  Looking <br/>
back at my choice to put 2 boxes in this one park seems a bit absurd <br/>
(but my eagerness to plant more than one got in the way of my common <br/>
sense). Along with the notion that geocachers may be planting in this <br/>
same park there is always the possibility of another box being <br/>
present. I love being able to travel to an area and know there are <br/>
10 -12 boxes available in the area.  This is not my concern<br/>
<br/>
 What I am trying to say is we would benefit the 'sport' if we were <br/>
to 'police' the per centage of boxes planted in any certain park. <br/>
Being sure to get permission, and having knowledge ahead of time of <br/>
what may or may not already be planted, is a must for bettering the <br/>
sport.  Maybe this has all been said before, and if it has, Kudos to <br/>
those who have said it. I just think it needs to be mentioned (or re-<br/>
iterated one). Other things to take into consideration of course is <br/>
always the size of the park, the difficulty to the seeker (clues and <br/>
terrain), and if any special skills are needed (scuba diving and <br/>
climbing walls); I would think the harder the trip the more the <br/>
boxes; likewise the easier the trip the fewer the boxes.  However, <br/>
what seems easier for one may be difficult for others.  And what <br/>
seems like common sense to me may seem like nonsense to others.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are always hitchikers which make for more fun and because <br/>
they move from place to place are the ideal situation. Alas, if it <br/>
weren't for the "stay put" boxes these could not exist....or could <br/>
they...do they?  Hmmmm!   <br/>
<br/>
Any opinions?<br/>

You know, this weekend we did the Critters of Ennisbrook. The walk <br/>
was pleasant and easy. There are seven (plus 1 HH) boxes along about <br/>
a two mile walk. It was not crowded, at all.<br/>
<br/>
I think my idea of where to put a box is based upon what I wish to <br/>
show others. I am usually very gratified to find a couple boxes in <br/>
one day. Eight in one is my new record. <br/>

<br/>
I have had geocachers trying to liken themselves to us. While we are <br/>
both following clues, I tend not to want to get involved with <br/>
geocaching. They are lugging objects out to put into a cache, objects <br/>
that I do not care about retrieving. Geocaching in National Forests <br/>
has really gotten some rangers up in arms. I think in Letterboxing, <br/>
we try to take and leave a good impression. (Might be a bumper <br/>
sticker in there somewhere *G*) We carve our own stamps (for the most <br/>
part), which encourages artistic impulses. We also write clues that <br/>
challenge the mind as well as the body. <br/>

BTW, last night my daughter carved her first stamp and is placing her <br/>
first solitary letterbox today. Ask me if I am proud.<br/>

boxes. I think more people should plant boxes that take some effort<br/>
(scuba diving  &amp; wall climbing - great idea!) If you are worried about<br/>
too many people overrunning your favorite park, just make your clues<br/>
harder to screen out all those who aren't serious puzzlers!<br/>
<br/>
Actually, increasing publicity and increasing traffic should be a<br/>
concern at most letterboxes. Its another reason to be very careful<br/>
about how far off the trail you hide it. My boxes don't get too many<br/>
visitors, yet I've noticed faint paths appearing in the 10 feet from<br/>
the trail to the boxes. I'm sure the plant life will be fine in time,<br/>
but its making it easier to guess where the box is hidden. I'm also<br/>
worried that vandals may follow the trails and discover the boxes by<br/>
chance. I'm not sure how to remedy that.<br/>

not been officially posted yet but that is being worked on. The North<br/>

The next closer ones are 15 to 20 miles away ......  Do you think  this<br/>
