how you accounted for the data skew associated with the following <br/>
three influences:<br/>
<br/>
1) The study participants were garnered from online solicitation of <br/>
forum members, who have ready access and facility with computers, <br/>
which may account for the higher educational level of the <br/>
participants. Many letterboxers may not have regular access to <br/>
computers or participate in online chat discussions; <br/>
<br/>
2) The willingness of study participants to readily contribute may be <br/>
a sign of their own enthusiasm (fanaticism), which may account for <br/>
the statistic related to fairly high participation in gatherings. <br/>
Many casual letterboxers do not attend gatherings and simply would <br/>
not care to spend much time contributing to your study;<br/>
<br/>
3) Midwesterners may have been more willing to contribute to the work <br/>
of another midwesterner, accounting for the high ratio of Illinois <br/>
participants.<br/>

rigorously defend her thesis shortly.  While Rick in Boca's questions are<br/>
valid, it might be more appropriate to send them off-list until her final<br/>
work is done.  I wouldn't want to see an explosion of negative opinions at<br/>
this point.  I do recall her request for survey participants was open to<br/>
all.  Those having an opinion should have responded.  Kinda like politics,<br/>
if you don't vote, you can't complain about the results.  Please don't<br/>
flame me for my opinions.  I am fascinated how closely I fit the profile<br/>
of a stereotypical letterboxer.  Since her area of study is communication,<br/>
our social behavior and how we communicate through letterboxes would be<br/>
just as interesting to study who we are demographically.<br/>

Remember that reliance on self-selected polling was a large factor in <br/>
the decision of the networks calling Florida for Al Gore in 2000.  <br/>

trying to say the first time is that we (the letterboxing community, in<br/>
some form of reality) should not jump to criticize the work before it is<br/>
complete.  That is the job of the panel.  For all we know at this point<br/>
... the demographics of the letterboxing community may not be the major<br/>
focus of this dissertation ... and that was all I intended to convey. <br/>
Clearly, self-selected respondents, with no reliable method for assuring<br/>
accuracy of response, is poor research methodology.<br/>
<br/>
And perhaps my comparison was not the best choice, but I do have the<br/>
opinion that you must speak up politically if you want have a voice for<br/>
change.  I do not understand why someone might feel it is okay to complain<br/>
about "the way things are," but will not take the time to vote when it<br/>
counts.  And on this subject, I will stop.  I don't want to get into that<br/>
can of worms.<br/>

&gt; &gt; a sign of their own enthusiasm (fanaticism), which may account <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; &gt; the statistic related to fairly high participation in gatherings. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Many casual letterboxers do not attend gatherings and simply <br/>
would <br/>
&gt; &gt; not care to spend much time contributing to your study;<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 3) Midwesterners may have been more willing to contribute to the <br/>
&gt; work <br/>
&gt; &gt; of another midwesterner, accounting for the high ratio of <br/>
Illinois <br/>
&gt; &gt; participants.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Back in November you were invited to participate in a web-based <br/>
&gt; &gt; survey<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about letterboxing as part of a doctoral dissertation. Well, I <br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; now completed the data analysis and written the report of my <br/>
&gt; &gt; findings.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  To take a look at what I learned about the 355 participants in <br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; study, check out my blog at www.letterblogger.blogspot.com.  I <br/>
am<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; adding new information to the blog every day for the next two <br/>
&gt; &gt; weeeks.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Thanks again to those who participated and supported me.  Your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; comments on the blog are encouraged.  Be well and do good <br/>
things.<br/>

someone has recognized letterboxing as an interesting cultural <br/>
phenomenon and has decided to study it.  There are lots of aspects of <br/>
letterboxing that are worthy of study, including communication, <br/>
community-building, folk art, etc, etc.  I was not at all bothered by <br/>
the sampling limitations -- all research is just a snapshot of whatever <br/>
was being examined at the time and must always be read critically and <br/>
with the limitations in mind.  Since I haven't seen any other studies <br/>
about letterboxing, it looks like our friend at Ball State has provided <br/>
us a great service as well as a platform for further study.  Any <br/>
takers?  :-)<br/>
