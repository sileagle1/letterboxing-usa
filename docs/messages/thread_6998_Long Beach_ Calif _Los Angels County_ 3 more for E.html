<div># 3  Elvis of El Dorado</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Park at the northern most perimeter road in Area 
III.  You may be hounded by hungry geese and ducks as you walk south along 
the western side of the lake.  You will see airplane hill up ahead on your 
right and you will pass by a shaggy palm island on your left.    
Did you see the movie "Tremors"?  Well, look for the green tremor critter's 
hump coming out of the ground.  From where the back of the critter emerges 
from  the ground head 101 paces at 200 degrees towards the critter's 
tail.  It is yellow with 3 forks and a middle stinger.  You will be 
passing by the King's green power box about 30 paces at 230 
degrees.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> From the yellow tail walk 72 paces at 90 
degrees towards and into the canopy of the laurel like tree, then 4 paces at 20 
degrees.  Elvis is hiding under the south side of 
a horizontal trunk/limb under grass and sticks.  The correct 
trunk/limb prevents you from walking into the lake.  Probe carefully.  
If you have walked too far from the tail you may come to a bridge.  Stop 
and return approximately 130 paces from the north east corner of the bridge 
following the  tree line along the waterway which should bring you to the laurel 
like tree.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div># 4  El Dorado Lady</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In Area II go by place where William Tell and Robin Hood could be at 
home.  Then you will come to a stop sign,  Go straight and soon turn 
left at Snake Road just before the stream crossing. Just before Snake Road 
joins the western perimeter road note 3 power line towers.  Park near 
by and start your foot hunt. Go to the south eastern corner of the 
chain link fence that surrounds the eastern most tower of the trio.  Pace 
off 52 at 140 degrees to a big tree with a trunk that branches off into 7 big 
limbs about 10-12 feet up.  <span id="__#Ath#SignaturePos__"></span> The box is in a cavity on the east side of 
the tree six feet up.  Bring a tall friend or a box </div>
<div> to stand on if you are short!</div>
<div> </div>
<div># 5  The Search for El Dorado (&amp; what is the meaning of life?), a 
semi mystery box.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>*The place name is a card game Omar Sharif plays and that uses four 
directions.</div>
<div>*The place is located on the north end of an area</div>
<div>*There are 2 of them here, try the north one where bikers can go</div>
<div>*A lake can be seen to the south</div>
<div>*Across the great divide are boats and a train</div>
<div>*A stream bed is close by.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Once you zero in on the site, the black micro box will be found on the 
inside of the north I beam just above the concrete under the northwest 
corner. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>El Dorado Park is the biggest park in Long 
Beach.  Bring along bikes, skates,  lunch and plan on spending a 
relaxing afternoon.  If you are from out of town, you can get 
a deli lunch at the markets or  fast 
food near the intersection of Spring and Palo Verde west of the park 
entrance.  Please let us know if any of the boxes are missing or need 
maintenance.</div></body></html>
