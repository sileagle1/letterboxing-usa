With more and more boxers each week, (hurrah!) when I sit down to check my e-mail, I'm overwhelmed by the number of posts.  I wondered if there could be a way to split the list between letterboxing clues -vs- socializing posts?  Both important to those involved, but honestly 7 or 8 posts a day from two or three people add up add that to the clues and I too find myself deleting without being able to read every post...I'm sure I'm missing good schtuff.<br/>
<br/>
Just wondered how the group as a whole feels about two different lists...or something in the memo line that defines what's to follow....or my least favorite idea, ...taking the multiple posts off list unless they are clue related.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts from others lurking?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>

the number of posts, I have shifted back and forth<br/>
using digest mode. <br/>
<br/>
What would save alot of time is for folks to try to be<br/>
much more clear in the subject line. For example, a<br/>
comment about "A Good Day Boxing" would be easier to<br/>
read or pass on if it began with the state<br/>
abbreviation. The region would be nice as well, but<br/>
the state, IMHO, should always be included.<br/>
<br/>
If the thread gets away from the initial subject, to<br/>
something off topic or of general interest, then<br/>
change the subject to reflect that.<br/>
<br/>
I know the webmasters ask us to ID the state for a new<br/>
box due to their own time crunch. I think many of us<br/>
who love to read posts for our specific areas are also<br/>
in the same position and so a state ID would help<br/>
greatly. Just my 2 cents.<br/>

e-mail format.<br/>
<br/>
I try to always keep on top of my e-mail, whereas this is something I <br/>
do when I have time.  To have all of the group messages mixed up in <br/>
my e-mail seems that it would be messy.  The way I see it, this is <br/>
really just Yahoo's form of a newsgroup, but instead of getting the <br/>
newsgroup messages in my regular e-mail program, I just hop onto <br/>
Yahoo and get them...  they are all there with subject, etc. any time <br/>
that is convenient for me to log on and read them, and I never have <br/>
to make a decision whether to delete a message or not just to clean <br/>
up my e-mail inbox.<br/>
<br/>
When I only have a few minutes, I scan subject lines for my state or <br/>
anything else that looks pertinent.  When I have more time, I go back <br/>
and read some of the messages I skipped, depending on time <br/>
available.  Although not organized quite as efficiently as a <br/>
newsgroup (with related messages threaded under each other), it is <br/>
still quite easy to pick out subject lines that are new boxes, new <br/>
issues or just follow-ups on previous messages.  <br/>
<br/>
I would agree with Linda though...  more concise subject lines would <br/>
certainly be helpful, particularly state abbreviation.  And I think <br/>
it is not uncommon for a thread to wane from general interest to a <br/>
conversation between two or three people, perhaps when that happens, <br/>
the individuals involved should take it offline and reply to <br/>
individuals rather than the group.<br/>
<br/>

ALthough I enjoy reading all too, I actually only read clues from my area, and delete all others.....but I do enjoy the stories and save them till a later time when I can relax and enjoy.....<br/>
<br/>
I think people should somehow label subjects: CLUES, CHATS or UPDATES......<br/>
