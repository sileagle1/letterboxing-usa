This is an often thankless job that requires a surprising amount of <br/>
dedication. I suspect most people on the list would be surprised at <br/>
the amount of spam and pornography these folks deflect, while they <br/>
also work diligently to ensure a comfortable place for us to talk <br/>
about our favorite subject.<br/>
<br/>
I think the link Choi provided to the updated list policies is <br/>
excellent and appreciate the thoughtfulness and work that went into <br/>
making it. At the same time, I happen to disagree with one of the <br/>
policies:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<related <br="" and="" hitchhikers,="" hobbies:="" letterboxing="" postal="" virtual="">
letterboxing are separate hobbies that evolved from traditional <br/>
letterboxing and posts related to those hobbies should usually be <br/>
made into lists or forums related to those hobbies.&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I've never been a fan of the fracturing of letterboxing lists into <br/>
smaller and more focused groups. I personally think that discussion <br/>
of hitch hikers, personal travelers, cooties, mosquitos, cuckoos, <br/>
postals, virtuals, exchanges, gatherings, and whatever creative <br/>
concept comes next from the mind of a happy letterboxer should be <br/>
completely welcome here on the big list. <br/>
<br/>
These aren't "related hobbies" the way geocaching, stone stashing, <br/>
benchmarking, bookcrossing, found art, freecycling, confluencing or <br/>
ecoscavenging are. These are Letterboxing, and this is letterbox-usa. <br/>
Now I'm not going to start posting 20 times on hitch hikers as a <br/>
protest, but I think it is perfectly okay to discuss all letterboxing <br/>
topics on this list. <br/>

My two boxing daughters and I then sat down and carefully carved our respective stamps. I put them aside for our first outing with them as our mark. Lo and behold the puppy ate mine before I ever go to use it. Sounds like a story the kid tells the teacher right. So it's back to the drawing board for me. And more carving practice.<br/>
