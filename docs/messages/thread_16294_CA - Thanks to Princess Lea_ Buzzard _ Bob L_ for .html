Princess Lea and Buzzard were here for the event on October 4th and <br/>
planted three boxes in the area. I am proud to say that we now have a <br/>
spooky Halloween, a Beach Grover, and a stinky cheese box located in <br/>
our county. Ash Raven was first find on the Halloween one - something <br/>
about birds of a feather, Mr. Buzzard. I was first in on Beach <br/>
Grover. And we still need to get up to Paso to get the next in the <br/>
Nancy Drew boxes, Stinky Cheese. Hmmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Bob L. of Stamp Luis planted a really cool two-part stamp, the <br/>
Caboose, recently. It is well-carved, despite his protestations of <br/>
being new to carving. And I think it was Watermelon who left a red <br/>
ink in the box with the black. You were right: it does look best in <br/>
two colors. <br/>
<br/>
Stamp Luis also is keeping their beautifully carved raven's head <br/>
stamp available at their store. So if you are in town, be sure to <br/>
stop by and ask for it. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, Lance (the guy who took the group photos) has started talking <br/>
about placing a stamp at his fire station. He is also a fire captain, <br/>
you see. In order to get it, you would need to show that you are a <br/>
blood donor, designated organ donor, CPR trained, or some such. I <br/>
told him that it would be a great thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
Off to work to warp the minds of a few,<br/>

Wooo who!  And I just donated blood yesterday!  Where do I go for <br/>
this box?  =)<br/>

Well if that isn't melodramatic enough, you could try setting <br/>
yourself on fire!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, though, ALL letterboxes have restrictions--some more than <br/>
others.  A challenging clue could be called "kid unfriendly".  A box <br/>
at the end of a strenuous hike could be called "couch potato <br/>
unfriendly".  A Connecticut box could be called "redundent".  (Sorry, <br/>
couldn't help myself.  *wink*)  My Guatemala boxes could be <br/>
called "traveler unfriendly".<br/>
<br/>
But...so what?  <br/>
<br/>
Not all boxes are meant for everyone, and it's a little presumptuous <br/>
to complain that everyone within a certain radius should be hiding a <br/>
letterbox specifically with you in mind.  There are a bunch of <br/>
letterboxes out there that I have absolutely no desire to get.  <br/>
Zilch.  I wasn't part of the intended audience, but that's okay <br/>
because there are plenty of other letterboxes that are my style.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I know some of you out there hide boxes thinking you have <br/>
EVERYONE in mind, but think about it.  Is your box wheelchair <br/>
accessible?  Very, very few I've found would qualify on that count.  <br/>
If you've tried to make your box "kid friendly", it'll probably be a <br/>
box I'm not interested in.  Kid friendly boxes need simple clues with <br/>
very short walks, but I like more complex clues and longer hikes.  <br/>
The simple fact of "dumbing down" a letterbox to make it kid friendly <br/>
inherantly causes it to be "adult unfriendly".  Don't get me wrong, <br/>
though, I'm sure many adults will appreciate the boxes--especially <br/>
those with kids--but I'd usually rather pass for bigger and better <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
See how your hands are tied?  You can't win by making EVERYONE happy.<br/>
<br/>
I think a stamp that you can only get if you donate blood is a GREAT <br/>
idea!  Not only does it provide a letterbox that blood donors can <br/>
get, but it might convince some non-donors to donate and provide a <br/>
life-saving pint of blood for someone that really needs it.  Shooting <br/>
down such a noble goal is, well, very un-noble.<br/>
<br/>
You know--I might be able to get a letterbox at a blood bank now that <br/>
I think of it.  I've donated over 70 times, and the folks there know <br/>
me VERY well.  (My name is even on the "over 40 donations" list they <br/>
have hanging on the wall--hopefully I'll make the 100 donations list <br/>
within a few years!)  I might be able to get something done there.  <br/>
But let me tell you, the only people who can get that box will be <br/>
those that donate!  If you can't for whatever reason, spend your time <br/>
looking for some other box.<br/>
<br/>
Ho ho ho....<br/>
