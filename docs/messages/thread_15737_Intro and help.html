fun I can't wait!  I actually went out last evening to look for a <br/>
box, but I couldn't find it. :(  I'm afraid that part of the clue has <br/>
been cut away.  More on that in a moment...<br/>
<br/>
My name is Natalie and I live in Watertown, MA, a suburb of Boston.  <br/>
A friend told me about letter boxing and I spent a good deal of time <br/>
at work yesterday reading about it!  I'm 28, opera singer by <br/>
training, admin by necessity.  I can't wait to place a box of my <br/>
own.  I'm not very handy with the drawing, so I'm not sure how great <br/>
my stamp will look, but I'm going to give it a shot!<br/>
<br/>
So back to the box I was trying to find, I was wondering if someone <br/>
could help me out.  It was the Rock Meadow box in Belmont, MA.  I <br/>
followed all the directions fine up to the concrete slab.  But then <br/>
my paces were *way* off from the placers, so I just took the next <br/>
trail on the right.  I was supposed to step over a large tree trunk, <br/>
but I never saw one.  What I did see though were alot of wood <br/>
shredding, like something had been cut up with a chain saw.  I poked <br/>
around the rocks all up and down that trail, but to no avail.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone been to this box who can give me a clue to help me out?  I'm <br/>
going to go out this weekend and find a couple of others that are <br/>
close to me, but I want to find this one too!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>
Natalie<br/>
