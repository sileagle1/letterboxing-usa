&gt;While visiting relatives in Pennsylvania this weekend we were disappointed <br/>
&gt;to find that there were no Letterboxes in their immediate area.  I pulled <br/>
&gt;out my carving tools and got to work.  We planted this one in the pouring <br/>
&gt;rain Saturday morning.  We hope you enjoy it.   We will be back in <br/>
&gt;Pennsylvania the end of next month and hope to plant several more, <br/>
&gt;probably in Wayne county since there are none there.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I carved a stamp for Promised Land at the end of last week and <br/>
will be looking to place it soon, perhaps this week, along with several <br/>
other stamps for the Pike/Monroe/Wayne County areas. I also helped place a <br/>
box last week in NY state just above the NE PA border (clue coming soon) <br/>
and have a couple of stamps ready to place in the Scranton/Wilkes Barre <br/>
area, too. There will soon be plenty more in the Pocono and Endless Mountains!<br/>

<br/>
     Sorry I never replied to you about the Pinebrook box.  We had a change<br/>
of schedule and weren't able to go look for it while we were down there.  It<br/>
is still on our list of ones to stomp into, though.<br/>
