Check the yellow pages for "Rubber and Plastic Stamps"  That should help to<br/>
bring the price down closer to $10...<br/>

&gt; Subject: [LbNA] Source for Commercial Stamps?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Looking at the LbNA site, it says somewhere that a 2x3" commercially made<br/>
&gt; rubber stamp should cost about $10. Around Scottsdale AZ, they are quoting<br/>
&gt; me $33-$35 for this. They haven't seen the art - I just told them it's<br/>
line<br/>
&gt; art with some type.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anybody have clues on where to get these stamps made for $10 or so?<br/>
I'm<br/>
&gt; going to Kinkos and another quick-print place for prices.<br/>

One supplier I've used is "The Creative Mode":<br/>
<br/>
A price list is available at:<br/>
http://www.creativemode.com/custom.htm<br/>
<br/>
A 2"x3" is $19, plus reasonable shipping.<br/>
<br/>
It's still more expensive than $10, but his quality is very good, and<br/>
if you can send him a B&amp;W computer image file, he'll make the stamp<br/>
from it.  He's done some *very* elaborate ones for me.   (I used to<br/>
have a nice set of .jpg's showing what I emailed him, and what the<br/>
resulting stamp looked like, but I can't find it, sorry).<br/>
