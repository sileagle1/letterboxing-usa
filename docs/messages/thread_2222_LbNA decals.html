<br/>
You deserve an explanation about the decals. It is<br/>
unfortunate that I need to do this on the list, but I<br/>
dont want anyone to think I made any changes or<br/>
unilateral decisions regarding what we ordered.<br/>
<br/>
When I received the order, I called the embroidery<br/>
shop in IL and told them that the decals were not what<br/>
we ordered.<br/>
<br/>
The shop told me that Kay Mohmers(who did the first<br/>
patch order) made the changes to the design after we<br/>
sent in the order. To my knowledge, the group was<br/>
never consulted on this. Believe me, I would not dare<br/>
make a change like that without first taking a group<br/>
consensus and receiving everyones permission!<br/>
<br/>
Because of that change, I could not use the postage or<br/>
envelopes that everyone generously sent and I did not<br/>
want to fold the decals to make them fit. That is why<br/>
most of you got your orders in a different (oversize)<br/>
enveloope.<br/>
<br/>
Kay Mohmers, if youre out there...did the embroidery<br/>
shop tell me correctly? Did you change the decals and<br/>
not check with any of us who sent in money?. If so,<br/>
shame on you. If not, do you know who did then?<br/>

I was kinda wondering about the decals  but wasn't about to bring it <br/>
up.  Some times things get alittle crazy on this list.  My only <br/>
reason for speaking up now is the fact that you took on this project <br/>
for all of us and for that I am greatful.  Then get stuck having to <br/>
get new envelopes and repostage them I hope you were able to salvage <br/>
the old postage stamps. Well, thanks again for taking on this order. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If these don't fit on your car you could:<br/>
<br/>
1) Include one as a first finder reward for a new box (do they fit in a<br/>
sandwich box?)<br/>
<br/>
2) Place them on the inside of your newest box to identify the contents.<br/>
<br/>
3) Include one in a geocache and try to convert a few souls over to join<br/>
the letterboxing effort. :)<br/>
<br/>
4) Mount and frame it on a plaque to add to your office.<br/>
<br/>
5) Or give one to your parents (which in my case would stick anything on<br/>
their car.)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry that you footed out the postage and envelope cost for this<br/>
mysterious mistake.  Hopefully it did not dip to deep into your<br/>
letterboxing supply fund.<br/>
<br/>
But most imporantly I want to thank all of you at the top for such a<br/>
wonderful job with these Patches/Decals/Website projects. I sometimes<br/>
enjoy doing this kind of organization, but I would rather be outside in my<br/>
spare time (when I get it.) I am quite thankful for all of your efforts.<br/>

decals are a little big but I don't care there going on my car!(and my<br/>
