                    <div class="plaintext-content">Elizabeth Cady Stanton was born Nov. 12, 1815 at Johnstown, NY. In <br/>
her sixteenth year, by her own account, she was already a believer in <br/>
women's rights.  Meeting Lucretia Mott at an anti-slavery convention <br/>
in London - on her wedding trip, it appears, she (they) soon issued a <br/>
call for a women's rights convention.  It was subsequently held in <br/>
Seneca Falls, NY in 1848.  Later she often joined forces with the now <br/>
more celebrated Susan B. Anthony to promote - and very effectively <br/>
so - this very just cause. It came to its ultimate fruition in 1920 <br/>
with the passage of the XIXth Amendment. Today's New York Times <br/>
Headlines on-line took note of her death in New York City on October <br/>
27, 1902 and provided a link to the obituary published then by the <br/>
Times.<br/>
The Women's Hall of Fame was established in Seneca Falls in 1969, and <br/>
of course Mrs. Stanton was an early inductee.  Today, in honor of <br/>
this extraordinary woman, a letterbox was placed nearby.  Clues will <br/>
soon be provided in the LbNA Website.<br/>
