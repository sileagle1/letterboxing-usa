I was looking at AQ a while back and saw a tutorial about covering freezer bags with duct tape to make a letterbox pouch (or a pouch letterbox?)  I was thinking about giving it a try, but now I can't find the tutorial.  Does anyone know where it went, or have any thoughts on this type of "box" that they'd like to share?  My thought was that a regular duct tape covered bag could possibly be attached to a guard rail with a magnet and somewhat camouflaged...<br/>

 Black tape works just as well, the object is to not let the bag stand out as well as toughen the plastic.<br/>
<br/>
I have three bags made by MrWndl, one was made with red tape.? You make them to fit the surroundings plus you can use the harder to find Camo tape on one side and the cheaper black on the other.<br/>

Cool!  By the way, where are people finding camo tape?  I've seen it a few places on-line, but not actually in any stores.  Though I've been meaning to check out the hunting &amp; fishing dept. at Wal-Mart.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Black tape works just as well, the object is to not let the bag stand out as <br/>
&gt; well as toughen the plastic.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have three bags made by MrWndl, one was made with red tape.? You make them to <br/>
&gt; fit the surroundings plus you can use the harder to find Camo tape on one side <br/>
&gt; and the cheaper black on the other.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This is almost all I use for letterboxing.  I use a quart sized <br/>
freezer bag, <br/>
&gt; &gt; covered with cammo tape.  You have to be careful around the <br/>
edges, because the <br/>
&gt; &gt; tape will sometimes come loose.  Make sure the tape on the edges <br/>
is secure.  You <br/>
&gt; &gt; can put the tape up to the very lip of the closure end, making <br/>
all but a very <br/>
&gt; &gt; tiny edge covered in tape.  If you put the log book in a plastic <br/>
bag, the stamp <br/>
&gt; &gt; in a plastic bag, and both in another bag inside the cammo pouch, <br/>
there is just <br/>
&gt; &gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; zero possibility that your work will become exposed to the <br/>
weather.  These are <br/>
&gt; &gt; very convenient to hide because their are flexible.  They are <br/>
also inexpensive.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;  was that a regular duct tape covered bag could possibly be <br/>
&gt; attached <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  to a guard rail with a magnet and somewhat camouflaged...<br/>

was in a totally open and urban spot.  Next time I'd tape the magnet  <br/>

Sometimes we don't bother with any magnets as most guard rails have a <br/>

Sometimes we attach a string to the end of the container so that the <br/>
only thing showing is the string end. See the string-Pull the string.<br/>

We have never used a duct taped ziplok as we find that usually the zip <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The problem with the "plasticized" camo tape is that it does not stick <br/>
to *itself* very well. So when you are covering your container with it <br/>
you must be very careful not to have the tape overlap itself. Instead <br/>
you must cut the tape exactly to fit sides and ends with no overlap.<br/>
<br/>
The tape still sticks well to the container; it's just that the "can't <br/>
overlap" problem makes it take much longer to cover the box as you are <br/>
attempting to exactly fit the tape to the container. It really is a <br/>
pain.<br/>

&gt; The problem with the "plasticized" camo tape is that it does not stick <br/>
&gt; to *itself* very well. So when you are covering your container with it <br/>
&gt; you must be very careful not to have the tape overlap itself. Instead <br/>
&gt; you must cut the tape exactly to fit sides and ends with no overlap.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The tape still sticks well to the container; it's just that the "can't <br/>
&gt; overlap" problem makes it take much longer to cover the box as you are <br/>
&gt; attempting to exactly fit the tape to the container. It really is a <br/>
&gt; pain.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope that makes sense. ---wood thrush<br/>

 Could the offending tape have been the removable 'no mar' tape from the hunting section that is made from cloth that is intended to come off as needed?<br/>
<br/>
Avoid plastic tape as mentioned as well as stretching the material tightly over the object where it will contract with time and weather.? Bags taped with the material can be folded or rolled up and placed anywhere with low profile ease hence the attractive concept.? I've switched to spray painting Lnl boxes over using expensive tape.? The paint job is fast, easy and if done correctly, durable.? <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I get my camo tape at Walmart, and I've never had a problem with  <br/>
&gt; &gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sticking - to plastic containers, to baggies, or to itself. I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seen other camo duct tape that didn't stick, but I don't know  <br/>
&gt; &gt; where<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they bought theirs. Maybe there are different varieties available,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; either in different locations or different seasons? Anyway, just  <br/>
&gt; &gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience - I love my Wal-Mart duct tape!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An experienced boxer has suggested to me to NOT use the camo  <br/>
&gt; &gt; tape<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from Wal-Mart. In their opinion, the camo tape did not hold (or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stick)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well in our cold/wet weather (central Ohio). They suggested camo<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tape<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from other stores. You can find it in the hunting section - I  <br/>
&gt; &gt; found<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mine at K-Mart, and have had no problems with it so far. I only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boxes out in the wild, and they've only been there for about 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; months.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this helps!<br/>

<br/>
I am back from my box maintenance tour, where all my boxes are freezer <br/>
bags covered with cammo tape, and they have held up very well.  Some <br/>
went out in the spring of last year, some in the fall.  We had a <br/>
terribly hot summer last year, and a horrid ice storm this past <br/>
winter.  I must say, all the boxes seem to be in excellent shape.  No <br/>
tearing, no faulty tape, the logs were nice and dry (yes they've all <br/>
been double bagged), no musty smells in the bag.  I am in Oklahoma, and <br/>
we tend to see extremes in weather here.  But all the boxes are fairing <br/>
well.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; The problem with the "plasticized" camo tape is ...<snip><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That the covering of synthetic, petroleum based products with more<br/>
tape, paint and other non-natural materials not only makes them even<br/>
more obvious, but that those choices seem like a poor cover-ups for a<br/>
poor hiding spot. <br/>
<br/>
If you have to do that much to cover it up, then perhaps it begs the<br/>
question of whether or not it is a suitable hiding spot for a box, and<br/>
perhaps you ought to look for another one. Once you've taken the time<br/>
to find the right hiding spot, you need only let the spot do the<br/>
hiding and not your tape.<br/>
