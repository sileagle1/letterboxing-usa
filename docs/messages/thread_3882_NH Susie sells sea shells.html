Ahh...too cool.  I read the message from the officer in yesterday's<br/>
digest and was thinking it interesting (as we were letterboxing in<br/>
Branford) that the message was posted to the talk list because that means<br/>
the person took the time to check it out and subscribe.  I was wondering<br/>
how this would play out.  Glad to know it's a story with a happy ending!<br/>
