&gt;  I was reading the end of "Song of Myself" over the<br/>
&gt;  weekend and got to wondering, was Walt actually<br/>
&gt;  the first American letterboxer?  What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;     I bequeathe myself to the dirt, to grow from the grass I love;<br/>
&gt;     If you want me again, look for me under your boot-soles.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     You will hardly know who I am, or what I mean;<br/>
&gt;     But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,<br/>
&gt;     And filter and fibre your blood.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Failing to fetch me at first, keep encouraged;<br/>
&gt;     Missing me one place, search another;<br/>
&gt;     I stop somewhere, waiting for you.<br/>
<br/>
I think we each plant a piece of ourselves and then grow...<br/>
not that we lose ourselves in the dirt but that we go forth.<br/>
The fruit of our labor is fun.  Walt gets my vote for first<br/>
American letterboxer, the first to understand he could be<br/>
planted and bring forth to others (once they would find<br/>
him...) even from his stationary place in the ground --<br/>
witness the joy we yet receive from him.<br/>
