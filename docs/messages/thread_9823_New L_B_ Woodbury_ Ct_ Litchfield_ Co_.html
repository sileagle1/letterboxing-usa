Planted by Rubaduc<br/>
Christmas morning 2002<br/>
<br/>
Easy, less than one hour.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: heading into Woodbury on Rt.6, from the junction of Rt. 64 &amp;<br/>
6 drive 0.6 miles and turn right onto Orenaug Rd. If you miss it, the<br/>
very next right is Orenaug Ave. and they both go to the same place. At<br/>
the stop sign you will see the Orenaug Park sign straight ahead of you,<br/>
this is where you will be starting  your hunt. Turn left and park along<br/>
the edge of the road by the pond, room for 4 or 5 cars.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: walk up the woods road at the park entrance and notice almost at<br/>
once a picnic table on a knoll to your right. This over looks a really<br/>
neat farm with some incredible animals, it's worth the time to take a<br/>
look.  The trail is blazed with silver metal strips over white paint, all<br/>
the way to the tower so keep your eyes on these. There will be a few log<br/>
benches along the way and then on your left an unmarked path to the left<br/>
leading to an overlook where (I'm told) some rock climbing is done. Soon<br/>
you encounter a major fork in the trail where the orange trail goes left,<br/>
down a hill and into the center of town, but you need to stay on the<br/>
silver to your right and watch ahead of you for a glimpse of the tower.<br/>
This is the second tallest fire tower I've ever seen and not for the<br/>
faint of heart to climb. After climbing it to what must be an incredible<br/>
view (no, I didn't go up) head north on the Blue blazed trail, to the<br/>
right of the tower, going down a small hill and turn right at the double<br/>
blaze. If you look part way up the hill ahead of you, you can see a small<br/>
tree with a blue blaze and a fallen tree leaning against it, when you get<br/>
to that tree take 8 steps north to a pile of rotted logs, reaching to the<br/>
left to claim your treasure.<br/>
Stamp in carefully and if you'd like more hiking, the blue trail is a<br/>
loop bringing you back to this point, or go back and take the orange into<br/>
town, shop and walk back to your car along Main Street.<br/>
Have Fun <br/>
