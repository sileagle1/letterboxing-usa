visit Long Island this holiday weekend. He was playing in a baseball <br/>

Unfortunately, rain postponed Saturday's action after only 4 innings of his <br/>
1st game. They continued play on Sunday, but were eventually eliminated <br/>
before they reached the finals. This left Monday wide open. Since we were <br/>
to catch a 2 pm ferry at Orient Point, we left our Inn early and headed for <br/>
the Point. But how were we to find the letterboxes? I had forgot to print <br/>
out the clues for the boxes at Orient Point before I left and it was <br/>
Memorial Day Monday and I had no computer. Fortunately, an Office Max was <br/>
open. I sweet talked a lady, or maybe they just let customers do it anyway, <br/>
into letting me access the website, where I printed out Ladybug's and <br/>
LoneMassWolf clues. The game was afoot. Matthew had brought his school <br/>
binder to complete his project and he had colored pens in it, so we could <br/>
recreate our stamp. With a pad of small paper from the hotel we were ready. <br/>
Alas, we could not find Ladybugs Orient Point letterbox. We found 3 "I"s, <br/>
but never could figure out which was the great gray rock. Thwarted, we went <br/>
after the Orient Point Light Letterbox very recently planted by Wolf and <br/>
Spirit. We found that one. Inspired as we were, we went back to looking for <br/>
the 1st one, but still with no luck. So, finally we set out for the other <br/>
box, which we realized we had not enough time for as we had to eat first <br/>
and all of a sudden it was 1 pm and it cost $7 just to enter the State Park <br/>
and the guy wouldn't let us in for a half hour without paying. So we went <br/>
and had some ice cream, and got an early spot in the Ferry line.<br/>
<br/>
Some failures, some successes. Life in a nutshell, on a baseball <br/>
letterboxing weekend. It was great fun for us, especially since an IHOP was <br/>
right next door to the Inn!<br/>

I, too am sorry my OP Ferry Letterbox eluded you.  It's always a <br/>
disappointment if the prize isn't realized when boxing with <br/>
children.  I'm happy lonemasswolf and YIMS had added one to the Point <br/>
to make your rocky walk worthwhile.  Good thing you didn't pay the <br/>
attendant to get into the Park to look for Turtle Crossing as it has <br/>
been reported probably missing.  I'll be up that way in a few weeks <br/>
and hope to check on them.<br/>
<br/>
I received an email this morning from Clayton who reports finding the <br/>
OP Lighthouse letterbox in what appears to be the spot described in <br/>
my clues to the OP Ferry Letterbox.  It will be good to take a walk <br/>
to get to the bottom of this little mystery.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
If I recall correctly, Connecticut is an Algonquin word for "wide <br/>
river" or "big river." I'm not sure if a tribe also existed with that <br/>
name, though one living by a big river would earn such. No Native <br/>
American language was ever written before the 1800s so spelling could <br/>
be variable.<br/>
<br/>
Another bit of trivia: a woodchuck is so called because the Native <br/>
Americans' word for the animal kinda sounded like "woodchuck" so <br/>
that's what the white guys started calling it. Obviously, ground hogs <br/>
don't chuck wood. :)<br/>
