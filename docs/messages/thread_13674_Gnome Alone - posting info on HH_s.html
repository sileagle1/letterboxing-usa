ensure that she will never, ever find a key chain, set of stickers or other <br/>
dime store goodie with her name on it...  Poor thing!  Critical issues one <br/>
neglects to consider when naming one's child...&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I named my daughter 'Chandler' which has been worsened by naming her older and younger brothers Jake and Ben.  At 5 going on 20, she is very aware of how many things DON'T say Chandler.  I can be a small comfort since I am an 'Esther' and the only thing I ever saw with my name on it was a fat little spoon-holding woman smashed flat (for easier hanging) that said, "Esther's Kitchen" across her apron.  I hate cooking.<br/>
<br/>
She says that since I knew of the name problem already, I should have named her 'Sarah' and she could have her name on a pencil.<br/>
<br/>
Madeleine and Chandler can both take heart in the wonderful world of mail-order and on-line merchandise where one can-for an additional $3.95-have their name put on darn near anything.  You should get her one of those custom books that features her name as the main character!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that got off-topic.<br/>
