for a comedy sitcom because I always read your post to my family and <br/>
we laugh til we cry!<br/>
<br/>
We were at Wintergreen on July 26!  So close to meeting you again!<br/>
<br/>
Personally I love newcomers (I don't like the term newbie either - <br/>
reminds me of shoebies on Rocket Power - yep I have little ones <br/>
too!) to the sport of Letterboxing - their enthusiasm gives me <br/>
another jolt of adrenalin!  (and they don't bellyache!) (much) <br/>
<br/>
My favorite posts are the ones like be ma's that blithely ignore the <br/>
negativity and simply report on the joy Letterboxing brings them.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that Paisley Orca's post really put my feelings into <br/>
black and white.  If you don't like it don't use it - visit now and <br/>
then to zap your boxes off and pretty soon it will just be a tool <br/>
about those boxes whose owners like the idea.  And it will be used <br/>
by folks who want to use it.  Isn't it sort of like the answer grid <br/>
in the back of the crossword puzzle book?  (I admit I've used that <br/>
now and again to get me over a tough word and I still use a pencil!)<br/>
But there are those who wouldn't be caught dead looking up an answer <br/>
or really just a hint... <br/>
<br/>
If you don't like "shopping lists" of reports of found and not found <br/>
boxes just skip over them til you find an "important" post.  What is <br/>
sad is when people have to stop and think about whether or not what <br/>
they have to report is good enough to post.  Thank heavens be ma <br/>
doesn't do that!  All the fun things we hear about - makes me wish I <br/>
were one of her kids!  sucking the marshmellow off the chocolate bar <br/>
ROTFL!! <br/>
<br/>
Have fun everyone!<br/>
