<br/>
I went up yesterday to check on the letterboxes that I planted over a year<br/>
ago in Palos Verdes, CA, and was very pleased to find them both still in<br/>
very good shape and where they belonged.  I was especially suprised to find<br/>
that they have been visited by more than the Lone Wolf (he who I planted the<br/>
boxes for to begin with, to give him something to do while he was out here<br/>
on a business trip) and my family.<br/>
<br/>
So who is Clyde and Elizebeth?  <br/>
<br/>
