second half got lost. Please don't go out with out the second half. the<br/>
part that got you to the first box is only half way and leaves you in<br/>
the woods.  I'll do another e-mail with both halves latter. I've got to<br/>
get to church I just wanted to stop as many people as I could, before<br/>
they get stuck in the woods.<br/>
