                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone, <br/>
<br/>
Before I start this little tale of woe let me say first of all that I do not<br/>
mean to point fingers at anyone, nor do I mean to blame anyone for my recent<br/>
misfortune while letterboxing.  However, last time I checked we were all<br/>
supposed to be having a good time and I thought I would share with the group<br/>
some things that will probably make the new letterboxers that were with me<br/>
never letterbox again.   <br/>
<br/>
So to begin my little story, I had decided to introduce my Aunts to<br/>
letterboxing.  Sir Balthazar was kind enough to design some stamps for me,<br/>
and I start carving their personal signature stamps.  Now one of my Aunts is<br/>
an avid rubber stamp collector, so the idea of letterboxing was really neat<br/>
to her.  So we are up and at it at 8am on a Tuesday morning. Our first stop<br/>
is Griffith Park in the Los Angeles Area.  There are two supposedly three<br/>
boxes located in this part, two as a part of Two Cats and a Troll and then<br/>
Mount Hollywood.  I don't know about other letterboxers but I look at the<br/>
difficulty clues and terrain comments to know whether or not I am going to<br/>
attempt to find a letterbox.  I count on the person/people who planted it to<br/>
give me a good idea of what I am getting into.  <br/>
<br/>
So we get the first box in the Two Cats and a Troll letterbox and we<br/>
basically figure that the second box that is supposed to be there, is not<br/>
really there, or the listing of two boxes is a misprint, if there is another<br/>
box in that area it is hidden so well that we could not find it.  <br/>
<br/>
Next we headed up to Mount Hollywood.  Now this is not the same as Mount Lee<br/>
where you are climbing the mountain that has the Hollywood sign on it, this<br/>
mountain is across from that one, though nearly as high.  So it is the<br/>
beginning of summer, and we start this hike out with a bottle of water each.<br/>
 It is so hot by the time we get up there we have already drank two bottles<br/>
of water between the three of us.  I am getting sunburned something fierce. <br/>
The sun and me don't get along on a normal basis, but in the direct sunlight<br/>
for prolonged periods of time at high temperatures, I dont burn I blister. <br/>
My Aunts were getting sun burned.  But we were determined to find that box,<br/>
heck we had climbed all the way up to the top.  Our clues for this letterbox<br/>
were at the end centered on pipes that came out of the ground and went in<br/>
different directions.  Well I hate to say this but interpretation is a<br/>
strange thing.  When one might thing a pipe crosses the path just high<br/>
enough to trip you that might mean it is an inch of the ground, or it might<br/>
mean it is three feet off the ground.  Either way the clues for this letter<br/>
box where in my opinion less than helpful.  There was no difficulty level<br/>
listed in the clues, no terrain guide, and worse yet, there was nothing<br/>
warning you that the only and I mean only shade you would find on the entire<br/>
mountain was one little tree at the very top.  I say this only in the hopes<br/>
of other people not getting hurt and burned and blistered but this is<br/>
suppose to be fun people, when planting a box like this you should warn<br/>
people of the heat conditions, the lack of shade, perhaps suggest they wear<br/>
sun block and take extra water.  We left Mount Hollywood without finding the<br/>
letterbox, giving up after four miserable hours in that heat.  My Aunts were<br/>
almost delirious from the heat at that point; you should have heard my Aunt<br/>
when she thought we were out of water. Thanks a lot you two you drank all<br/>
the water, now I am going to have to survive on my own saliva My Aunt<br/>
dropped the last water bottle on the way down the mountain and as I looked<br/>
back, there they were my Aunt on her hands and knees reaching over the side<br/>
of the mountain to try and reach the water bottle.  It was that hot that<br/>
they were scared to hike down the rest of the mountain without any water.  <br/>
<br/>
Next we headed to the LA Arboretum.  This was sort of cool because we got<br/>
there way past the time that we were supposed too. After spending all that<br/>
time up on Mount Hollywood and then getting some lunch and of course the<br/>
drive in miserable LA Traffic we got there at about 4:30 and didn't even<br/>
have to pay to get in.  We started rushing through the part and found the<br/>
first box that was hidden in there. The LA County Arboretum boxes.  This<br/>
letterbox had great clues, great location and a good job hiding the stamp. <br/>
The other one that was located in this area we didn't have as much luck with<br/>
  The clues hinted that the box is hidden in some place that might be 700<br/>
degrees. So we checked the surrounding ovens and barbecue.  We finally<br/>
guessed that it might have been hidden in one of these and then remove later<br/>
 we were not sure, but finally gave up on that one.  <br/>
<br/>
Next we headed toward Pasadena and to the Millard Falls letterbox.  Don &amp;<br/>
Gwen I apologize ahead of time for the things I am about to say, but<br/>
unfortunately I think they need to be said.   We arrived at the starting<br/>
point for the hike up to the falls at six o'clock that gave us at least two<br/>
hours of daylight.  This letterbox is listed as an easy  mile hike. There<br/>
should have been no way that this letterbox would take us more than two<br/>
hours. Don and Gwen do warn you that you will be on rocks and crossing a<br/>
creek, but honestly the clues never gave me the impressing that practically<br/>
the entire hike was going to be on rocks and boulders. The waterfall is way<br/>
more than a half a mile in and you are surrounded by large rock cliffs that<br/>
offer a lot of shade but also take light away very quickly.  We reached the<br/>
falls itself at just a little after seven.  We should have headed back a lot<br/>
earlier, but we were determined to find this box.  The clues had you looking<br/>
for a red and white sign that no longer exists, so deciding what massive<br/>
tree this box was at the bottom of was not easy.  This is where things<br/>
started to get dangerous.  There was one tree that was huge, and had at its<br/>
roots lots of moveable rocks.  As we started climbing around the tree moving<br/>
rocks to try to find the letterbox the rocks started falling.  This is<br/>
probably where I broke the first side of my ankle.  One of the good size<br/>
rocks rolled down the hill that the tree was on, slammed into my ankle and<br/>
pinned my foot against the root of the tree.  It took me holding on to the<br/>
tree and my Aunt moving the rock to get my foot out.  Right after that I<br/>
finally noticed a wooden pole at the bottom of this tree and thought just<br/>
maybe the sign use to be there.  So thinking my foot was just bruised I<br/>
hobbled north of that sign to another massive tree.  This was the right<br/>
tree all right, but again the tree was located on a incline, and incline so<br/>
steep that I had to hang on to the branches of the tree to get from the base<br/>
of the tree where I had found the letterbox.  Well of course I have the<br/>
letterboxing sickness and there was no way I was leaving without stamping in<br/>
  By the time my two Aunts and I quickly stamped into the letterbox and I<br/>
put it back we had about 15 minutes of light left to get back down.  I will<br/>
admit that this was a bad call on my part; I should have left without the<br/>
letterbox way earlier when I had the light to get down, but I wanted that<br/>
letterbox!  About five minutes down the hill my already weak ankle slipped<br/>
on a rock and down I went. I knew when I hit the ground that something was<br/>
broken it just hurt too badly.  As bad as this sounds I have a really high<br/>
tolerance for pain, and for me to be crying over pain, I knew that something<br/>
was really wrong.  At this point my Aunts insisted I get up and we get out<br/>
of there.  Darkness had hit buy this point and here we are, trying to make<br/>
our way out of this cove over rocks, boulders, crossing back and forth over<br/>
the creek with me crying hysterically, and none of us being able to see much<br/>
farther than our hands in front of our face.  Cursing ourselves all the way<br/>
down for being so determined to get that box.  But also really upset, once<br/>
again we had followed the difficulty and terrain guides on the clues.  There<br/>
is no way this was a easy half mile hike. This hike should have been<br/>
listed as at the minimum a medium there should have been a more clear<br/>
warning that you would be on rocks and water the entire length of the hike<br/>
and there is no way this hike was half a mile. It took us damn near two and<br/>
a half hours to get out of that cove in the dark, scooting our feet and me<br/>
walking down on a bad ankle.  I had no idea yet that my ankle was chipped<br/>
and fractured on both sides; I just knew it hurt worse than about anything I<br/>
had ever felt.  <br/>
<br/>
We had lost light completely, it was pitch black, there was even no<br/>
moonlight out this night when luckily a guy who had saw us go in but not<br/>
seen us come out came looking for us with a flash light.  He found us right<br/>
and the exit of the cove.  An exit that has about 4-5 really long but really<br/>
narrow steps you have to get down.  With this guy holding the light my Aunts<br/>
began to try and help me get down these steps.  Oh I should add also that I<br/>
don't know who in their right mind covers steps in chicken wire, but these<br/>
steps were covered in chicken wire!  On the right side of the steps coming<br/>
down was about a ten-foot drop off.  The guy moved the flashlight for a<br/>
moment and my Aunt that was behind me took one step and down she went, all<br/>
ten feet crashing to the bottom. My Aunt in front of me, scared senseless at<br/>
hearing her fall leaves me on the second step down, throws me all the bags<br/>
and goes to help my Aunt.  What do I do? I drop my butt down to the steps<br/>
and slide down.  I have no other choice I can't step down by myself and I<br/>
can't stand there on one leg.  By the time I reach the last step I have<br/>
completely ripped not only the seat out of my pants, but what was under them<br/>
too, and my plump little toosh is hanging out the back of my jeans for<br/>
everyone to see.  All scratched up I might add. I would just love to get my<br/>
hands on the person that covered those steps in chicken wire.  That has to<br/>
be about the most dangerous thing I have seen yet.  My Aunts get back up and<br/>
now; we still have to hike out of the park.  But hey at least there are no<br/>
rocks or creeks to cross now.  We finally get to the car and since it is my<br/>
new car, there is no way I am letting someone else drive it, So I drive home<br/>
from Pasadena to Los Angeles using my bad ankle to drive with. (It had to be<br/>
my right ankle right?)<br/>
<br/>
I finally get back to my parents house were I was staying, and get myself<br/>
something to eat and then go to sleep.  In the morning my foot hurt so bad I<br/>
could hardly walk, but at that point I manage to get myself in the car again<br/>
and drive myself to the emergency room.  After x-rays that contort your foot<br/>
in ways you should never move a broken ankle and three hours the doctor<br/>
finally says to me Your one tough cookie girlie, I have no idea how you<br/>
walked out on that ankle. You would not walk a quarter of a mile flat today<br/>
if I paid you a million dollars. You know what? I hurt so bad he was right.<br/>
 I know this is already a long little tale but I just have to add a couple<br/>
more things.  This all happened two days before Iron`Bear flew in from<br/>
Portland to spend a week in California with me.  This little adventure put<br/>
me in a wheel chair and on crutches, my ankle was so badly broken that I<br/>
could not even get a cast put on yet because the swelling was too bad.  I<br/>
might get a cast finally this Thursday if the swelling has gone down enough.<br/>
 If Iron`Bear was not such a good guy and so willing to take care of his<br/>
girl this probably would have ruined our entire trip.  There were a lot of<br/>
plans we had to change, but it all turned out fun and okay.  <br/>
<br/>
Again let me say that I made mistakes during this adventure. I should have<br/>
been more prepared, more water, better shoes, a flashlight, things I won't<br/>
ever forget again, and I promise that no letterbox will keep my hiking when<br/>
I know I wont have time to come down, no matter how cool it is.  But also, I<br/>
think we, as groups need to look at what happened to me and take some time<br/>
to be more responsible in what we say in our clues.  Be more detailed and<br/>
honest about the terrain, the climb, the hike and the length of the hike. <br/>
Had I known the true details of some the Mount Hollywood and Millard Falls<br/>
hikes, I probably would not have attempted Mount Hollywood at the hottest<br/>
time of day, during early summer with too little water and no sun block. <br/>
And with the true details of Millard falls I probably would not have<br/>
attempted it so late in the day.  We all make stupid mistakes; this one cost<br/>
me a broken ankle, a cast for 6-8 weeks, and a long vacation from my<br/>
favorite sport.  The saddest part of the whole thing for me is that I am<br/>
moving to Portland to be with Iron`Bear in August, and 6-8 weeks in a cast<br/>
means that I will probably be too busy packing when this cast comes off to<br/>
do anymore serious boxing in California while I am here. <br/>
<br/>
So that is my little adventure.  I hope everyone takes the time to be more<br/>
detailed with their clues and remembers poor pandora and her broken ankle<br/>
when having fun letterboxing in the next two months <laugh> <br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well <br/>

<br/>
Letterboxing, like any outdoor sport, carries the risk of unforeseen <br/>
hazards.  "Letterboxing North America" supports a policy of not <br/>
knowingly placing letterboxes in areas that will create undue risk <br/>
to the letterbox hunter.  However, as conditions may vary, it is the <br/>
responsibility of the letterbox searcher to become thoroughly <br/>
familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to <br/>
adequately prepare for those conditions, and to conduct oneself <br/>
safely and responsibly with respect to those conditions and with <br/>
respect to his or her personal abilities and <br/>
limitations.  "Letterboxing North America" and the individual <br/>
letterbox sponsors assume no liability for events which may occur <br/>
related directly or indirectly to one's searching for a letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
I also noticed that the website has more up to date clues for Mt. <br/>
Hollywood than you used. Those may have helped you. Always check for <br/>
updated clues before hunting.<br/>

I think, sir, that you might need to read the lady's post one more <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
She did not offer to sue anyone; she did take responsibility for her <br/>
own actions and decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Now then, what she did plea for, and I concur, is ratings for sites <br/>
commensurate with the difficulty of the terrain and other hazards <br/>
local.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a competition. It is not a contest. It is, I hope, a <br/>
gentle sport that encourages art, beauty, nature, puzzle-solving and <br/>
adventure. Telling someone who is hurt in pursuit of this sport that <br/>
they "should read the disclaimer" seems a tad cold and discouraging. <br/>
Obviously, you did not mean it that way; but it might be nice for you <br/>
to reaffirm that to the lady.<br/>
<br/>
I shall take the lesson to heart, myself, in posting clues. If there <br/>
is a local hazard or danger I can foresee, I will post that with the <br/>
clues. We have everyone from great-grandmothers to infants going <br/>
along on some of these hikes. Surely we owe them the common courtesy <br/>
to warn them if the hike is very strenuous for them. I know I would <br/>
appreciate the same warnings in that I limp along on a knee destroyed <br/>
by torture in service to my country. Though some of us may start life <br/>
as mountain goats, most of us do not so end our lives that way.<br/>
