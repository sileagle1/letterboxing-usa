<br/>
and I see a lot of stamps have not been "star'd" in.  It was my <br/>
understanding they were due in Chuck's hands by Sept 1.  Unless you <br/>
are planning to mail these via Express Mail (and as always I <br/>
appreciate the additional funds)I think there are a lot of folks that <br/>
need to get carving this week!!<br/>
<br/>
I just hope they weren't lost . . . <br/>
<br/>
And if you are coming to Mansfield and have figured out who I am <br/>
please ask descretely and I will bestow upon you my personal traveler.<br/>
