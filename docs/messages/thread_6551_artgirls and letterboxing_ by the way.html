    Why not contribute your log-making stamp carving and fashion<br/>
skills to this site?  Several of us got into boxing through an<br/>
interest in carving, not hiking.  We can certainly benefit from<br/>
diversification.<br/>

Seattle got together initially (we're all female and all friends through <br/>
an art -group-, thus, "artgirls"), and it's just evolved.  It's no <br/>
different than regional groups getting together and having their own <br/>
lists or their own websites.<br/>

Plus, you'll note in my original posting that anyone's welcome to join, <br/>
gender irrelevent.  It just started that way, we have a logo, and <br/>
*shrug*, no biggie.<br/>
<br/>
About it not being appropriate here, I'm sure that it isn't expressly <br/>
forbidden or anything, but I did get the feeling, when anything is <br/>
posted other than clues/gatherings info/functional postings, that there <br/>
are a lot more of the people on this list who prefer the hike to the <br/>
stamp, which is FINE and there is NOTHING wrong with, of course, it's <br/>
just a different focus.  And rather than bore the heck out of those <br/>
people who would prefer this to be a more functional list, or just sit <br/>
around and complain privately, we made our own space.<br/>
<br/>
People are free to join if that suits them, if it's not their thing, <br/>
that's fine too -- we're all letterboxers. :)<br/>

I don't think Eliza said it was ONLY for women, though it is implied in the name. I suspect that even it if is, like-minded men would probably be welcome. However, I don't personally know very many men who would want to spend an entire day chatting about peanut butter ice cream and how to get it to the top of a mountain without it melting. Also, I doubt that this list wants to delete 20 messages devoted to that topic. <br/>
<br/>
&gt;2)  I don't want to have people stop posting things about their stamps and <br/>
&gt;notebooks and such to THIS sight just because someone decided that "poof" its <br/>
&gt;not appropriate here.  I LIKE talking about the fun stuff related to <br/>
&gt;letterboxing and assume that its SUPPOSED to be posted here.<br/>
<br/>
No one said they'd stop talking about stamps, notebooks, etc. on this list. I have seen lots of posts regarding other things here, and I don't think there actually many rules about what can or cannot be discussed here. But I do not think I'd ask people on the letterboxing list for help with the peanut butter ice cream issue, or about whether REI sells purple wool socks. Those two things are not exactly letterboxing-related, and so I would figure they were not appropriate for this list. If I wanted to know about how to make my own logbook, this is one of the first places I would ask, though. Letterboxers tend to be very artsy, and very creative. (:  <br/>

<br/>
I think there's room for more than one letterboxing<br/>
list.  I can see the point in the second list--ice<br/>
cream on the trail just isn't a topic I've seen<br/>
brought up here yet. ;o)  However, if you'd like to<br/>
know my solution for the urge for ice cream on the<br/>
trail, I'd be happy to share, it's really not a<br/>
secret. :o)<br/>
