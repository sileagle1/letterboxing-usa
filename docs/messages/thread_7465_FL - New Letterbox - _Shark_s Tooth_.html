Placed by: The Tortoise and the Hare<br/>
Located in: Florida, Sarasota County, City of Venice.<br/>
Easy, Almost a drive-up box.<br/>
<br/>
Venice, FL is the Shark's Tooth capital of the world.  One couple told mentioned that they had picked up 457 teeth in one day!<br/>
<br/>
To find this particular "Shark's Tooth" in South Brohard Park, follow Business 41 into Venice.  Turn LEFT at the first intersection after you cross the bridge, onto Ave. Del Circo.   Turn RIGHT onto Airport Rd.  (you will pass the infamous Florida Flight School along this road.)  Turn LEFT onto Harbor Rd.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on Harbor Road past Sharky's (you may want to come back for a drink later!)  You will see one of the few public golf courses in SW Florida across the street as well.  Continue past Brohard Paw Park.  Turn RIGHT into the parking area for South Brohard Park.   This park is part of the Sarasota Co. Parks and Recreation Dept.  There are no animals permitted at this particular park, but the box won't take you very long to find - so you can bring Fido back to the Paw Park when you are finished if you want.<br/>
<br/>
When you enter South Brohard Park you will see two different wooden walkways which will access the beach.  Shark's Tooth is hidden beneath the handicap access wooden walkway - closest to the handicap parking, and furthest from the road.   It was placed as close as possible to the parking area, but still under the wooden walkway.  As always, take care when reaching into dark areas and be cautious of local wildlife.  Please make sure to tuck the box back up under the ramp to keep it out of view (and hopefully up out of flood range.)<br/>
<br/>
While in the area you should take the time to walk along the beaches and look for sharks teeth.   I particularly enjoyed the area near "Sharky's" - a resturant/bar with a wonderful sunset view.    Sit down and enjoy a frozen drink (with or without alcohol as appropriate and desired) after you find the Shark's Tooth box plus all the teeth along the beach.<br/>
<br/>
Because we are not local to the area, we would appreciate any information about the condition of this box when you visit.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
