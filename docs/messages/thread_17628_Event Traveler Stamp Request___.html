I haven't requested any, since just about all the traveling event <br/>
stamps I have ever seen I have seen multiple times at the last three <br/>
New England Gatherings.<br/>
<br/>
There will be an Event Stamp, carved by Brian of Team Green Dragon, <br/>
a "Post Event" Stamp, if anyone wishes to carve one (the name of the <br/>
restaurant is "Tweeds" if anyone needs inspiration ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, at the POE Event in MA, I will be harboring a hitchhiker hostel <br/>
rather than having hitchhikers all over the stamping tables which <br/>
takes up much time.  Anyone who has a hitchhiker in their possession <br/>
can bring it to the event, stamp the Event stamp into it, and place <br/>
it in the hostel.  For every one hitchhiker you place into the <br/>
hostel, you may take one out and bring it with you on your travels.<br/>
<br/>
And don't forget to bring something for the potluck luncheon table.<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least - bring clue sheets for the area letterboxes!  I <br/>
have just recently placed an additional six this past weekend (clues <br/>
to be forthcoming next week).<br/>

Thanks to the efforts of WarriorWoman, who has done most of the groundwork; Phyto &amp; Isoceles, who had a sit-down with Farmer Harvey and Brian of TeamGreenDragon who will expertly carve the event stamp.<br/>
The location is the same place as the Peace on Earth letterbox in a very letterbox-rich part of MA. Hopefully there will be huge turnout to celebrate this new talk list. See ya there!"<br/>
