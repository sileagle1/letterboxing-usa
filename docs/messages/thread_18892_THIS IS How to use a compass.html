&gt; Some of the clues to boxes involve using a compass.  For example got <br/>
&gt; to point A and take a reading of 160 degrees.  How do I do this?  Do <br/>
&gt; I have the compass point to North and then see where 160 degrees is <br/>
&gt; and go that direction?  Thank you!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

If you have a compass with a base (usually see-through with an arrow down the <br/>
middle) Get it out and do this.<br/>
<br/>
A.<br/>
"Put Red Fred to Bed"  by turning the entire compass until the red needle <br/>
fits within the red-needle-outline.  That is the direction of north.<br/>
<br/>
B.<br/>
Look for an arrow drawn onto the compass base - outside the degree dial. <br/>
For clarity, call the arrow on the base your bearing arrow or your walking <br/>
arrow.<br/>
Turn the base until the walking arrow is lined up with your degree bearing. <br/>
160d would be from North.  If it said 20d southwest then it would be 200d from <br/>
North.<br/>
The trick is that while turning the base, keep "Red Fred in bed." or keep the <br/>
red north arrow pointing at north at the dial.  <br/>
<br/>
C.<br/>
This is what we tell the kids: Hold the compass so that the tail end of the <br/>
walking arrow  (or the place where the lanyard is tied to the compass base) is <br/>
at your belly button.  Point your feet and your nose in the direction of the <br/>
walking arrow.  <br/>
<br/>
D.<br/>
Be sure that "Red Fred is still in bed" and your walking arrow is at the  <br/>
correct degree.  If it is not then redo steps B &amp; C.<br/>
<br/>
E.<br/>
Now, with your nose and toes pointing in the direction of the walking arrow - <br/>
start walking the distance given.<br/>
<br/>
F. If you need to turn around and come back just put "White Wally in Fred's <br/>
Bed"  which means line the white South arrow up in the red outline.  Follow the <br/>
steps above.  You'll be headed in the opposite direction.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you don;t have a compass with a base - get one.<br/>
Otherwise - use an index card with an arrow draw down the middle of it <br/>
(lengthwise).  This will be your walking arrow.  Set the compass on the index card <br/>
and follow the directions above.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't have orienting arrows or outlines (i.e. the red outline for <br/>
north or the black outline for south), use the N on the dial or the little red <br/>
triangle on or within the dial  or draw one on the compass.<br/>
