<br/>
When Meriwether Lewis and William Clark returned from their <br/>
expedition, they found that Connecticut was just too crowded ffor <br/>
them. They had to get back to the woods. In those woods, which <br/>
happened to be in Woodbridge, Connecticut, they left mementos <br/>
of themselves and were reminded of an absent friend.<br/>
<br/>
Three letterboxes placed in the Alice Newton Street Park in <br/>
Woodbridge. The hike is suitable for children and dogs <br/>
(leashed) and takes about fifty minutes exclusive of stamping <br/>
time. It includes a lovely stream and a small waterfall, the <br/>
Wepawaug Falls.<br/>
<br/>
To reach the park, take exit 59 of route 15, which is the exit for <br/>
routes 63 and 67. Take 63 toward Woodbridge, turning left at <br/>
route 114. Continue on 114 until reaching a fork. Bear right at the <br/>
fork (Newton St.), then make the first possible left (Meetinghouse <br/>
Lane). Park on Meetinghouse Lane beyond the church.<br/>
<br/>
The entrance to the Alice Street Newton Park is between the <br/>
church complex and town hall. There is a large trail map at the <br/>
entrance. Your trail is the blue trail.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the blue trail until you cross a footbridge. About 22 paces <br/>
from the far end of the bridge, turn left onto a red-orange blazed <br/>
trail. You should be near the stream, but above it (a smaller path <br/>
goes right beside the stream). Continue on this trail until you <br/>
come to a stone wall. Turn right off the trail and walk about 18 <br/>
paces along the far side of the stone wall. You should see two <br/>
strikingly white hunks of quartz. Your first box is in the wall a few <br/>
feet beyond the second hunk of quartz, but before the fallen log. <br/>
Stamp in, replace the box carefully, and retrace your steps to the <br/>
blue trail.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on the blue trail through a meadow and over three <br/>
more footbridges. When you reach the fork that is posted for the <br/>
falls, bear left toward the stream and the falls. Go upstream until <br/>
you come to a large fallen tree lying just to the left of the trail. At <br/>
this point you should be standing on bare rock. To your right <br/>
locate a projecting rock at about knee height. Standing beside <br/>
this rock, take a bearing of 280 degrees. You will see a tree that <br/>
has a hollow at the far side of its base. The second letterbox is <br/>
under a trapdoor on the near side of the tree.<br/>
<br/>
To reach the third box, continue upstream on the blue trail. Take <br/>
a minute or two to stop and admire the waterfall. If you've packed <br/>
a picnic lunch, this is a good place to have it. After the waterfall, <br/>
the trail veers away from the stream, eventually looping around to <br/>
the right. Stay on the blue trail--it's easy to get off onto another <br/>
trail.<br/>
<br/>
After the trail loops around, keep an eye out on the right side for a <br/>
large fallen tree with a significant boulder--really a small <br/>
outcropping--under the base. The third box is hidden under a <br/>
trapdoor at the north end of the boulder/outcrop. When you have <br/>
stamped in and replaced the letterbox, you can continue on the <br/>
blue trail for the most direct route back to the beginning, or you <br/>
can take the red trail at the meadow and curve back on the <br/>
orange-red trail along the stream for a slightly longer walk.<br/>
