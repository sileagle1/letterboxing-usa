                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, if I could go back in time I would post about<br/>
religion or politics, because that would be less<br/>
offensive.<br/>
<br/>
The following tirade is for only a select few. Not a<br/>
mass condemnation. You'll know who you are within<br/>
seconds of reading ahead.<br/>
<br/>
This will be my last post, so you can spare me more<br/>
hate e-mail and save yourself time writing rebuttals.<br/>
I'm off the subscriber list. You can rejoice now.<br/>
<br/>
I think by the number of posts against my position,<br/>
ironically, to me at least, my point is proven. To the<br/>
people of my counter point- you know you are right. I<br/>
won't waste our time trying to show you a different<br/>
viewpoint in the future. Apparently, that is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I certainly didn't mean to emotionally castrate any of<br/>
you who cling to numbers. I really wasn't trying to<br/>
start a huge urinating contest either.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't remember writing anyone's name either. Curious<br/>
isn't it? -People seem to have an idea who I was<br/>
talking about anyway...latent guilt or subconscious<br/>
realization there is some weight to what one single<br/>
person thinks that's not apart of your clique?<br/>
<br/>
God as my witness, I just wanted people to forget<br/>
about the stupid numbers for 10 seconds. It was that<br/>
simple and innocuous. Of course people need them as a<br/>
reference and as a matter of pride. I get it. I do it.<br/>
Just not to the extent others do. I never said throw<br/>
the stats away; I was simply tired of seeing certain<br/>
people stuffing them down our throats. <br/>
<br/>
No, I wasn't talking even about the people that feel<br/>
the need to validate their letterboxing careers with a<br/>
signature of numbers, just the ones who every post<br/>
have to tell you how great they are. If you think I'm<br/>
imaging this, you're fooling yourself or you're no<br/>
different then the people I'm criticizing.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I, philosophically, am a more humble person.<br/>
I realize in the SUV McWorld we're in, that is a flaw.<br/>
Again, this resulting situation, which I will wash my<br/>
hands of for the good of the sport, proves how clingy<br/>
some of us are towards numbers (status) as<br/>
letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone seriously thinks I was trying to "push<br/>
around" anyone...Get a grip. (I have more of your<br/>
stamps than anyone else's and was always grateful for<br/>
your efforts to the extent of which my girlfriend and<br/>
I left dog biscuits in one of your boxes for your dog.<br/>
Thanks for jumping in with everyone else, buddy.)<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, I know all of you are right; you must be,<br/>
because there are more of you than me. You win. :)<br/>
I quit. This isn't how I understood letterboxing to<br/>
be.<br/>
It seemed more innocent to me than what all the posts<br/>
have indicated. <br/>
<br/>
Again, I never advocated banning stats. I'm just sick<br/>
of certain people being in your face about it. If some<br/>
of you construe this as political correctness, you're<br/>
high!<br/>
<br/>
Since it would seem apparent that I'm the pariah, the<br/>
only one who thinks this way, and according to the<br/>
letterboxing clique-I'm wrong- I'll remove my boxes as<br/>
to not litter up your forests.<br/>
<br/>
Remember the April fool's joke on us that Martha<br/>
Stewart was going to invade letterboxing? Well, guess<br/>
what? She didn't but her way of thinking and attitude<br/>
did.<br/>
<br/>
Before I go, just two points you should try to take<br/>
with you:<br/>
1. My point was REALLY misunderstood! I can honestly<br/>
say, everyone knee-jerked over it, but I'll take the<br/>
blame for that. Obviously, I wasn't clear enough.<br/>
<br/>
2. Try reading Socrates.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to collect peaks instead of stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>
