HORSETRAP TRAIL LETTERBOX<br/>
Fish Hatchery Park<br/>
Grants Pass, Josephine County, OR<br/>
Dropped April 14, 2002<br/>
By Mark, Jeanne, Jade, Matt, Shan and Annette<br/>
<br/>
(Directions and clues written by Mark. If you find any problems with this <br/>
letterbox, please email Annette at nehnie@aol.com).<br/>
<br/>
Trail length: About 1.5 miles roundtrip if you stay on track.  <br/>
Clue Difficulty: Easy.<br/>
<br/>
    In 1999 two kids named our route Horsetrap Trail and in 2002 they dropped <br/>
a letterbox there. No one but them (and now you) calls it Horsetrap Trail, <br/>
so don't look for any signs that say that. As they hiked, the kids would <br/>
find sticks and dig holes with them. They had seen a guy riding a horse out <br/>
there, and it scared them, so the holes were horsetraps. Now you know.<br/>
    The trick in finding this letterbox is finding Horsetrap Trail itself. <br/>
Go to Fish Hatchery Park, 8 miles south of Grants Pass, Oregon. (Go south on <br/>
Highway 238 to New Hope Road, right on New Hope Road 3 miles to Fish Hatchery <br/>
    Road, right on Fish Hatchery 2 miles to Wetherbee Road just before the <br/>
bridge  over the Applegate River. Go right again half a mile to the end of <br/>
the road, and stay left. In 2002 when this letterbox was dropped, there were <br/>
no signs for the park until we actually entered it.)<br/>
    From the parking lot head west (i.e. downriver) on the main trail, an old <br/>
wagon road that parallels the river. After 600 meters, the wagon road veers <br/>
right, away from the river, and a narrower trail appears on your left. <br/>
(Because there are other trails veering to the left, the kids will give you <br/>
another clue: There are a bunch of posts with numbers on the top throughout <br/>
the park, signifying the location of different tree species that are part of <br/>
a guided nature walk. The junction of which we speak is right next to a post <br/>
with the number 19 on top).<br/>
    You could go to the left at this junctionit is a nice side route that <br/>
pops out on a sandy river bar before looping back to the wagon road. <br/>
    But to find the letterbox stay on the wagon road. Horsetrap Trail begins <br/>
where the sandbar trail loops back to the wagon road 200 meters farther <br/>
west. Horsetrap is the continuation of the wagon road, but this is a tricky <br/>
junction, so be careful. Generally speaking, you want to be staying to the <br/>
right here. There is a post with the number 16 on top, and you want to <br/>
stay well to the right of that. Horsetrap Trail changes from a wide path to <br/>
a single track path where it dips down to cross a rocky creek bed before <br/>
going uphill 300 meters. If the trail you are on doesn't have this long <br/>
hill, it isn't Horsetrap.<br/>
    There is some poison oak in here, so stay on the trail. Additional clue: <br/>
Half way up the hill is a post with the number 15 on it.<br/>
    Near the top, another trail comes in from the right (across from a post <br/>
with the number 14 on it). This other trail is an alternative way back to <br/>
your car. It just isn't as pretty because it is out of view of the river.<br/>
    To find the letterbox keep going west (i.e. downriver). You are high <br/>
above the Applegate here, and it is quite pretty. 80 meters from post 14, <br/>
Horsetrap crosses a cut 3 feet deep that requires hikers to go down then <br/>
steeply up. <br/>
    Go to the bottom of that little gully, and look directly (not left, not <br/>
right) up the hill. Twelve meters above the trail (as it crosses the base of <br/>
the gully) is a cedar tree with a small rock pile at its base. Hidden behind <br/>
the rock pile is the Horsetrap Trail Letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
(Woohoo! This is our first dropped letterbox. Please email us with your <br/>
