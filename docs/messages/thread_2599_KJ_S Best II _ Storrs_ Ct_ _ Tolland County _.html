spring it was stolen. Here are clues  to the new box in a new place. <br/>
We hope you enjoy a little adventure and a lot of ice cream. <br/>
    KJ'S is Kathy Johns ice cream shop  it is at the intersection of <br/>
Rte 44 and  195 just north of the University of Connecticut  campus <br/>
in Storrs a section of Mansfield.It makes a great stop on a day of <br/>
letterboxing in the area.  Enter the ice cream shop and your senses <br/>
explode. The smell of cheeseburgers, the colorful decorations hanging <br/>
from the ceiling dazzle your eye, bins of Beany Babies await a cuddle <br/>
, and somewhere amidst all this a letterbox. We recommend  you turn <br/>
right ,pass the candy and take another right into a letterboxers <br/>
dream world. Millions of rubberstamps...... so many images ,imagine <br/>
all the great box ideas. We begin shopping not with purpose but <br/>
reckless abandon the kid let loose in the candy shop. A stamp of this <br/>
and two of these. This would make a series. Then on the wall to the <br/>
left we spy little eliptical inks all in rows. Then there are those <br/>
excellent color markers. Which color for which stamp? to the right is <br/>
a shelf or two filled with cats and dogs. They are so cute we drop to <br/>
our knees. There are specialty papers stacked too. Deep in a dark <br/>
recess here, near the floor is a letterbox. When you find it retreat <br/>
to a booth and ponder all the choices of stamps. The new stamp was <br/>
donated by the kind folks at KJ's as well as the bold colored ink.  <br/>
Stamp in the book leave a note and return it  to its den. Please try <br/>
not to let anyone see you  taking or returning the box. As check out <br/>
your purchases and think about the wonderful flavors. Plan  another <br/>
letterbox too. <br/>
