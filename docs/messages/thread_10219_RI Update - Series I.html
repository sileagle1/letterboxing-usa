<br/>
Dad and I braved the bracing winds Saturday and headed back to Bristol to the East Bay Bike Path.  This time we started with Series I - The Jogger, The Chair Wheeler,The Rollerblader, and The Coffee Break (with a little Starbuck's in hand)were all in good condition.  <br/>
<br/>
Can someone confirm that The Tired Cyclist is still in existence.  We couldn't find him, but that doesn't mean it wasn't there.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally the Walker was a bit waterlogged.  The box was not covered at all and inside there was water with a thin layer of ice.  The stamp and stamp pad were dry, but the log book was wet.  We dried the box out, replaced the bag that the log book was in and were able to squeeze out the book enough to actually stamp in.  <br/>
<br/>
Tweety and Mr. Coon may want to go check it out.  We did cover it over with the available materials, but other than leaves there was little available.  <br/>
<br/>
After finishing off here we headed back to The Letterboxer of Series II.  This time we found it, no problem and everything was in good condition.  All in all a good but blustery day.  See you all next week.<br/>
