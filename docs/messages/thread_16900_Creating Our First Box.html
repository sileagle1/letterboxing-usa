  We have a theme and a stamp idea.  We have now found 5 boxes, so we <br/>
have a good idea for the container and such.  However, I would like to <br/>
solicit any input from the "expert" placers for hints and tips on <br/>
creating a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
We want to include a First Finders certificate.  Is there any standard <br/>
for what these look like?<br/>
<br/>
Besides the stamp and journal, what else should we include in the box?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Congrats!  =)  It's a lot of fun hiding your own boxes.  I know <br/>
Mischief of Seattle created a great webpage about the first box she <br/>
placed with pretty pictures and everything.  It's at <br/>
http://home1.gte.net/res0fpfm/letterboxes/tips.htm#first%20box<br/>
<br/>
I also created a webpage for how to create "Great Letterboxes" at <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/Docs/GreatBoxes but mine isn't <br/>
nearly as pretty as Mischief's.  Still need to add pictures and snaz <br/>
it up a bit.  However, you probably won't be interested in most of <br/>
what's on my website since it's more of an "advanced techniques" kind <br/>
of page.  For a first box--especially one in an area that's lacking <br/>
letterboxes--simple is best!  Simple clues, simple location, simple <br/>
everything.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!  =)<br/>

<br/>
In my first boxes I tried to include everything (inkpad, logbook,<br/>
stamp, pen, email slips, letterboxing info. sheet, etc.).  After<br/>
doing several and having some go missing, I decided to just<br/>
include the logbook, stamp, letterboxing info. sheet and my<br/>
email included in the logbook.  Now, to have less impact and<br/>
increase my chances of the box not going missing, I almost<br/>
exclusively make microboxes using the white film canisters<br/>
and narrow strips of paper stapled into a logbook.  This has<br/>
the advantage of being small and waterproof, but the <br/>
disadvantage of the log being to small to allow very many<br/>
visits.  However, since there are so few letterboxers in<br/>
Texas, this is not a problem at this time.  Glad to have<br/>
you join the ranks and I look forward to finding your box!<br/>
