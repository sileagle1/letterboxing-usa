exchange, and met the wonderful "spy" from CT (Darren). Even our <br/>
waiters were into the action! <br/>
    My PFX count went way up and we didn't have to freeze our na-nas <br/>
off to get them!<br/>
    You'll in CT have to be hardcore to venture out in the cold. It <br/>
was in the upper 20's and way too cold for me! I'm a wimp and proud <br/>
of it.<br/>
     Congrats to all who hit their 100th that day. Princess Turtle <br/>
was especially happy that it had occurred at one of her boxes. She <br/>
has pasted the stars in our logbook.<br/>
     Happy hunting to all!<br/>
