                    <div class="plaintext-content">My wife and I placed an 'easy' letterbox on Prince Edward Island a <br/>
few days ago.  It is located off a short (&lt; one hour) nature trail in <br/>
a provincial park.  It should be a perfect diversion for families <br/>
with children, or just for a quick hike for those on vacation.  The <br/>
other box will be planted tomorrow, probably near Antigonish, Nova <br/>
Scotia.  We had intended to place one on Cape Breton Island, but the <br/>
weather didn't look great today.  This letterbox will be a longer <br/>
hike, maybe two hours.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues will follow within the next week or two.  <br/>
<br/>
Are any of you planning to visit Atlantic Canada anytime soon?  If <br/>
not, then perhaps these boxes won't be found until next year.  But <br/>
that's OK.  Both boxes will have my email address, in case whomever <br/>
finds the box wants to contact me. <br/>
<br/>
Tonight we're going to a Celtic music concert in Louisbourg, on Cape <br/>
Breton Island.  We'll be leaving in a few hours.  Then tomorrow, we <br/>
plant the second letterbox as we begin our drive home.  <br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned for the clues!<br/>

Chris, in CT <br/>
