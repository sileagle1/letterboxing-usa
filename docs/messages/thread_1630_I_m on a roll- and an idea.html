Sounds like one heck of a trip!  I understand the wild boars can be quite<br/>
dangerous (not to mention alligators!)<br/>

It sounds like you're on to something with the picture clue idea.  I was<br/>

&gt;dangerous (not to mention alligators!)<br/>
<br/>
Boars are infamous for having an "attitude", but like most wild <br/>
things down here generally won't attack unless they feel cornered or <br/>
protective of something (like baby boars). This one was definitely <br/>
more scared of me than I was of it.<br/>

Actually I was thinking of taking a placing a letterbox under a <br/>
particular alligator and taking a picture of it. I was then going to <br/>
give instructions to poke every alligator you find that resembled the <br/>
picture with a stick until either you found the box or were eaten, <br/>
whichever comes first. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I was thinking about taking pictures of some distinctive <br/>
landmarks with addition clues from those landmarks. The aerial idea <br/>
sounds good too, but much more difficult than what I in mind.<br/>

Not really---www.terraserver.com. <br/>

I'll already used it for some of my letterboxing and geocaching, to<br/>

About the photo as clue idea, I say GO FOR IT!  Why not be innovative?<br/>
After all, you're a pioneer on the frontier of North American Letterboxing!<br/>
The suggestion about aerials that someone suggested sounded interesting, but<br/>
a little too complicated for my simple mind.  But, hey, I guess the sky's<br/>
the limit...literally in this case!!!<br/>

<div><b>Subject:</b> [LbNA] I'm on a roll- and an 
  idea</div>
<div><br/></div>Today I was again checking out a place where I am planning to 
  place <br/>some new letterboxes. It is a park on the flood plain of the St. 
  <br/>Johns River (on the other side from where I placed the Canaveral 
  <br/>Marshes letterbox). I expected to see a lot of alligators (down here 
  <br/>anything larger than a mud puddle supports at least one alligator). I 
  <br/>was not disappointed as I saw at least a dozen of various sizes. What 
  <br/>I didn't expect, and was really excited about was that I came across <br/>a 
  wild boar! I did get one picture before he disappeared into the <br/>tall 
  grass.<br/><br/>Now for the idea. Has anyone posted clues that include pictures 
  as <br/>part of the clue? I am thinking about making a couple of boxes that 
  <br/>would use a picture of something distinctive that would need to be 
  <br/>found as part of a clue. Since most everyone has a printer of some 
  <br/>sort hooked up to their computer I think this might be a neat idea. I 
  <br/>can hear the Luddites moaning already ;-)<br/>-- <br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Eric

In the UK we give a heap of bearings for our boxes (and precious little<br/>
else) .  Those with the most 'vivid' sense of humour often add a bearing<br/>
to "a sheep", or "my rucksack" or perhaps in more reliable British<br/>
tradition a bearing to "that large grey thundercloud on the horizon"...The<br/>
funniest (most extereme ?) I've read in the UK was the bearing to "the<br/>
Devon bull charging at us right noooooooow!"<br/>
<br/>
But certainly Eric's alligator clue is a winner by a big margin ! <er very<br="">
big grin&gt;.  Eric that would make a good subject for a stamp imho...!<br/>
<br/>
There is currently a Dartmoor walk series out with stamps representing<br/>
some "standard letterboxing terms " eg 'lone tree on horizon', and 'under<br/>
large stone" <chuckle> ..and of course the clues match the stamp image and<br/>
the location....but Eric, you dont actually need to match that part too  !<br/>
