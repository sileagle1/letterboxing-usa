<div><span class="900062823-21092002">HI!    We went out and fought the 
mosquitoes today and found this series (in route to a birthday party. I never go 
anywhere anymore with out thinking 'Is there a letterbox in that area') we are 
sad to tell you that all three of these boxes were soaked! The log books are 
just damp thanks to the baggies but everything was floating in these boxes. We 
dried them out the best we could but I really think you should consider 
replacing the boxes with something a bit sturdier (rubbermaidish) the lids are 
all warped &amp; don't fit on the boxes well. </span></div>
<div><span class="900062823-21092002">Sorry 
for the news!</span></div>
