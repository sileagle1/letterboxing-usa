<br/>
First, the turnout for this meeting is going to be great! From what I've seen on <br/>
the postings and in my emails, there are some new letterboxers who will be <br/>
joining us veterans! It should be quite a bit of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Second, it seems that everyone has pretty much decided on the date of March <br/>
2nd, which is perfect for us. So, unless anyone has any severe objections, let's <br/>
hereby decree that Saturday, March 2nd, will be the official date.<br/>
<br/>
Third, we've gotten a lot of good suggestions for places to meet. The <br/>
Raubsville Tavern in Raubsville, PA and the Ship Inn (Milford, NJ) seem to be <br/>
the most popular choices, both within about 15 minutes of each other. <br/>
<br/>
I've been to the Ship Inn a number of times before, and I know that they have a <br/>
separate dining room in the back (along the glassed-in room with the <br/>
beer-making thingies). And, I must admit, the idea of the English Pub ties into <br/>
letterboxing's roots rather nicely (and their cheese &amp; onion pie is the <br/>
cheesiest!). <br/>
<br/>
Other people have said that the Raubsville Tavern has a larger room available, <br/>
but since I've never been there, I can't say. It looks like it's up for sale, but I <br/>
don't know if that would make any difference for our plans. So, I'll defer <br/>
opinions on the Raubsville Tavern to those who have more experience with the <br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion is that we use the AYH Hostel at Lake Nockamixon (near <br/>
Quakertown, PA). They have a room that is open for the use of residents of <br/>
Bucks County, and it can accomodate 30-40 people. So, the option exists that <br/>
we can gather there first and show off our stamp collections, and then those <br/>
who are interested can go have dinner somewhere a few hours later.<br/>
<br/>
So, everyone, chew on the above info for a while and let me have your thoughts <br/>
and opinions! Oooh, this is going to be fun--I can't wait until March 2!<br/>

get-together since we're newcomers and driving up from<br/>
South Jersey, but since it looks like you've decided<br/>
on a convenient date and area for us, we can most<br/>
likely be there.  So if you're taking a head count,<br/>
lease count us in.<br/>
