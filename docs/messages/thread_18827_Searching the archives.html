                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't know who posted about searching the archives of 40,000 posts, but I know I had kinda the same reaction to some of the insinuations earlier in the past week's maelstrom.  Yes, on the surface the yahoo archives can be very handy at times, but there are plenty of huge obstacles to reading them, and to actually finding what you need if you do.  I'm able to read these posts in my email while being offline.  However, if I go to the archives I have to stay online for very long periods of time, which I can't do for several reasons.  The posts take forever to come up (yeah, sorry, I don't have the latest fastest computer), and when they do it can be nearly impossible to follow the threads even if they are what I might need.  For instance, a bunch of the posts entitled "Lemony Snicket" and "And then There were None" mostly had nothing to do with either of those titles.  When I suggested earlier mentioning states in the subject, I wasn't trying to be smart or elitist or lazy or make some edict that everyone has to follow. But I sure do thank the people who do think it's a helpful idea, because that's all I hoped for.. to be helpful.  One other reason it is practical is that lots of states have landmarks with similar or identical names and I have often been mistaken about what state was being mentioned. Peace Valley Park.  Licking Run.  The Falls Trail.  Letterboxing mysteries are awesome, but that doesn't seem the right kind of mystery, because it is not intended to be a mystery. If someone is trying to be informative, why turn it into a mystery? <br/>
<br/>
All I know is that if I'm going to search archives of 40,000 messages and can't stay online long to do it (and I imagine plenty of others have this dilemma), I'd like to make it a somewhat worthwhile activity precisely so I and everyone else can go out and get exercise and do real searches rather than cyber ones.  I spent eons one day before I joined this list trying to figure out what the original thing about "April Fools" was, so I could understand all the subsequent posts.  I never was able to find it and had to give up. I still wish I knew what it was, if anyone wants to enlighten me.  Sure, I'm very curious and tenacious and will search and search like many others, especially if it has to do with searching for actual clues. And I read FAQs diligently. But if it's useless and non-productive, and I have 4 others to share this machine with and a telephone as well, forget it.  All those ancient posts is more than I can deal with.  Some, yes... 40,000, no. The question of whether to include examples of carving on the LbNA site is a similar one to me.  If it's so easy to click on a link to some other website that has some samples, but at the same time we all admit that carving is at the very core of letterboxing, why not just simply have some on the site?  It's not as if it's exactly more mysterious, just because we make newbies click on some links to find some samples instead of having some there on the best-known Lb site.  The site should have all parts of the core letterboxing stuff, then send people on from there to the less crucial parts and to all the other lovely links.  Otherwise newbies are just always going to wonder why sample stamps are missing, when it's such an excellent site.  Also, we will continue to get repeated questions (starting more wars) about where to find samples. The simple fact is that people who don't surf much don't always take notice of links or may worry about clicking on them.  Don't get me wrong, I do love the mystery though and agree that there are boxes for everyone.   Heck, I agree with Mark... let's just get out there and box.  Thanks to all who have been creative and are trying some new solutions.    --lunaryakketyact<br/>

&gt; I got that what she's saying here comes down to "If you send a <br/>
newbie to the archives, give them some idea of where to start" - they <br/>
weren't there for the conversation and would have no idea how it <br/>
went. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THAT!!!  Anyone out there know ASL??  I'm frantically doing <br/>
the 'that' sign over here.<br/>
<br/>
I was the poster who first mentioned 40,000 posts.  I'm also a <br/>
college computer instructor and the owner of 3 other lists almost as <br/>
old as this one.  I'm no idiot on the computer.  I don't want to be <br/>
spoonfed or have clues immediately dropped in my lap.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm just speaking up for all the other people who aren't and <br/>
saying 'let's be cool and give'm some idea!'  Let's give newbies a <br/>
CHANCE to figure it out on their own (which is what everyone wants) <br/>
by politely giving them a direction or starting point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that the REAL emotional reaction in some of these <br/>
posts is anger and frustration about wishing the hobby was back where <br/>
it used to be-- small and isolated from the world at large.  <br/>
Unfortunately that's the way of life guys.  "Call someplace paradise, <br/>
kiss it goodbye" (with apologies to Billy Joel).  It's a given that <br/>
it will happen eventually to everything that was once 'secret'.  Make <br/>
a movie about Dalmations, the world 'discovers' them and suddenly <br/>
shelters are brimming with unwanted dogs.  :-(<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, Dave, for trying to understand rather than attacking.  I do have huge appreciation for the history and genuinely want to know about it, and have been reading as much as I can without going to the point of having my family think I suddenly went off the deep end and hauling me off to a therapist!  I surely never said a thing about "not liking it" (reading archives).  That's actually quite funny, if you knew my very shy, bookworm-ish past. Au contraire-- If I lived in a vacuum, I could read back to 1998 or whenever in the archives, online, to my heart's content... just as I could also dive into a pile of library books for a decade. I probably "like it" way too much!!  My real point was that for a whole host of reasons, archives which must be read while online will be helpful to some people in a big way, and to others only in a smaller way, no matter how terrific all those posts were.   I realize not everyone has to share their computer, or their phone line.   My appreciation in fact grows by the day, the more I read on here and elsewhere, and it somehow even transcends all the inflammatory statements, because I fortunately hear a lot of wisdom and grace here as well and have never been one to give up on the human race so quickly!  I guess that too I will attribute to being the oldest of 8. <br/>
<br/>
So, just because I have kids, I (and they) don't plan on, and have not been doing any bulldozing.  I feel there's enough of that going on already!  Around here, it takes enough time to get to one small gem of a box, that anyone would be foolish to not take the extra minute to re-pack it well and re-hide it, vultures or not... which we did.  My kids (and spouse!) are old enough to have a little fear their mother may temporarily forget she has offspring when she gets involved w/ something like poring over clues, but young enough to get fascinated &amp; caught up in it too, and above all to keep their minds open.  Our middle one amazes us with her artwork and has really enjoyed carefully sketching possibilities for her stamp and dreaming up a handle.  I've no doubt she'll plant some great ones someday for all of you experienced boxers.  The oldest has learned respect for all creation-- the hard way.  And the youngest, well, he's a peer mediator at school, so someday we may need his peacemaking services if this list is to survive into the coming decades!  I'm going to try to continue reading posts &amp; truly listening rather than jumping to a false assumption about the person behind the posts. Hope you'll all do the same.  We all have something to contribute, if we do indeed respect this hobby. Let's give people a chance, and maybe even a second and third one.      --lunaryakketyact<br/>
