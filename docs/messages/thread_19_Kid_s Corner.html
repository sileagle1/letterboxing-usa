&gt; Kid's Corner:<br/>
&gt;  I wonder if it should be separate to discourage<br/>
&gt;  kids from wandering into some of the clues on<br/>
&gt;  this page that may take you into remote and/or hazardous places.  Or<br/>
&gt;  would it be good to just put a note on the clue like "Good for Kids." <br/>
&gt;  Perhaps the kids corner could represent special instructions geared for<br/>
&gt;  kids and then point them only to the "Good for Kids" clues???  I'm just<br/>
&gt;  thinking out loud.<br/>
<br/>
As always, just my 2.5 cent's worth... I am hopeful that most of us are not<br/>
setting out boxes that are terribly hazardous, although many do require adult<br/>
supervision.  Most of these types have tended to be very remote or have had<br/>
difficult clues (compass positions, for example.) so I don't really see any<br/>
reason to keep the Kid's Corner completely seperate.  But it would be nice to<br/>
have a special page containing links to all the clues that are suitable for<br/>
young 'uns.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, as you suggest, a simplified set of instructions would be good.<br/>
Many of the kids will not have the freedom to go out and find the boxes that<br/>
we list on the website, so I think we should show them how to make simplified<br/>
letterboxes that they can hide in their neighborhood for other kids to find.<br/>
They will not need a website to advertise clues on... just word of mouth will<br/>
do, I'm sure.<br/>
<br/>
All they need is a box, a book, and a stamp.  If we can put together a set of<br/>
instructions for making a stamp using relatively "safe" tools, I think that<br/>
would be a fun aspect of it, as well.  (By relatively "safe" tools, I am<br/>
referring to a beginner's set of wood carving knives, or even a wooden pencil<br/>
with the eraser pulled out leaving the metal cylinder intact.)<br/>
<br/>
We could even provide a page of simple designs they could print off, darken in<br/>
with a lead pencil, and then burnish onto an eraser.<br/>
<br/>
Kids wouldn't necessarily even have to have an ink pad.  They can color the<br/>
surface of the stamp with a felt-tipped, water-base marker, and then start<br/>
stampin'.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we might want a simple guide to writing kid-friendly clues, and an<br/>
explanation of what to do when you find a box (i.e. - "stamping in").<br/>
<br/>
The neighborhood letterboxers of today are the world-class letterboxers of<br/>
tomorrow!  (and orienteerers, and artists, and architects, and teachers, and<br/>
map-makers, and computer programmers...)<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Der Mad Stamper<br/>
