<p>Local man, Robert Smith, has been caught and convicted on several counts of 
burglary. Smith was arrested last week at Viets Taven, owned by prison warden, 
John Viets, after creating a drunken distubance. Smith admitted to stealing his 
neighbor’s horse last month. </p>
<p>When authorities went to his barn to retrieve the horse, they also found 
jewery and money stashed beneath the hay and under floorboards. </p>
<p>Robert Smith is also suspected in the robbery of Blacksmith Higley’s 
copper coins, but the coins have yet to be recovered.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>Robert Smith has been sentenced to 20 years at the Old 
        New-Gate Prison in Turkey Hill where he will join other Tories, thieves, 
        and debtors working in the copper 
mines.</blockquote></blockquote></div></body></html>
