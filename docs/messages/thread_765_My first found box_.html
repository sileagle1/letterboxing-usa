that I finally had a chance to get out and find my first box last<br/>
weekend!  And what a thrill it was!  I stumbled across one of the<br/>
letterbox sites a few weeks ago, and have been collecting my tools, and<br/>
trying to get some time to go searching since then.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to the Drew Clan, the clues for the Cherry Blossom box were<br/>
excellent -- I plan to return to that area this spring when the<br/>
blossoms should be in bloom.  It really is lovely down there.  <br/>
<br/>
And since I live in the Washington, DC area, keep posted for a bunch of<br/>
new letterboxes in the area!  We are planning to place several by<br/>
spring, so when you travel here, you will have plenty to keep you busy.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays and "Boxing Day" to all!<br/>

Good for you! I remember the thrill of the first 'find" - Tom Cooch's<br/>
panther, and a fun day with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can add a few boxes when the weather turns right. As a side<br/>
thought, might seem to be pushing the envelope, so to speak, to be<br/>
'letterboxing' around significant national crowd-filled monumnets over<br/>
the next weeks or so. There are enough suspicions floating around<br/>
already - no need to have our safe hobby caught up in anything.<br/>

Erik, you are so right. When we were boxing DC, we were mightly tempted<br/>
to place a box or two in the woods to the south of the Lincoln Memorial<br/>
and in a favorite fountain just north of the Viet Nam Memorial, but<br/>
were absolutely convinced that we would be rounded up by lurking secret<br/>
service agents. And then, to confirm our suspicions, we actually saw an<br/>
agent outside the British Embassy while placing the Kid Gloves series<br/>
and asked him for directions! We think that any cute little boxes<br/>
hidden in the bushes would seem more ominous there in that town than<br/>
perhaps elsewhere.<br/>
