yesterday amid drizzles arriving at a socked-in peak. It was a <br/>
wonderful hike.  I found Moon Over Pumpelly Pines.  Box intact, but <br/>
ink pad watery. I must get sensible and stamp a few times on a piece <br/>
of paper before stamping in my journal. It was drizzly so I laid out  <br/>
my journal, then the letterbox logbook, in my packpack so I could <br/>
stamp in and keep everything dry.<br/>
  From there we hiked down to #2 of the Grand Monadnock series.  <br/>
Intact, with a really nicely carved stamp. I replaced the ziplock the <br/>
logbook was in. Our final stamp of the day was #5 of the series. The <br/>
stamp is so detailed, it is incredible! There was no ink pad so I <br/>
used my moss green one which came out awesone. No pen either by the <br/>
way.<br/>
  It was so nice to see stamps of (new to me) letterboxers.  I <br/>
recognized Pete and Wanda's stamps of cours as well as Melissa, Don <br/>
and Max. The weather skunked us today. We shall return!<br/>

Thanks so much for posting on our Monadnock letterboxes. I am always <br/>
amazed that the park rangers sign in and let them live, since this <br/>
treasure of a rock pile is so lovingly maintained. Kudos to the New <br/>
Hampshire Park Service!!!<br/>
