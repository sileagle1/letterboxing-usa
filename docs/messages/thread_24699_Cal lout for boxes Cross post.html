for a buddy :)<br/>
<br/>
I am having a gathering in April, and I plan on planting 3 series for it.<br/>
The First will be at my house, right next to Sudbury Valley Trustees <br/>
connecting by a trail<br/>
Probably a Farm theme for this one. It could stay in place as a WOM <br/>
after the event.<br/>
<br/>
The Second will be at the SVT headquarters.<br/>
Nature and Conservation themes great<br/>
<br/>
The Third will be at King Philip's woods. These will have to be WOM <br/>
because of the fact that the gathering is being held on SVT property <br/>
they want me to get permission. I don't know if I can, or want to, <br/>
because if I did go ask, then all my boxes might have to be pulled!<br/>
The place is called: King Philip's Woods and here is their description:<br/>
<br/>
The abandoned Old Berlin Road, historically an important stagecoach road <br/>
from Boston to Lancaster, is now a dirt road running through the upland <br/>
side of the parcel from Water Row to Old Sudbury Road. A short distance <br/>
in from Water Row, on the right of Old Berlin Road, you will see the <br/>
foundation of an old tavern. This was a 2'/2 story structure about the <br/>
size of the Wayside Inn. It was here that the stagecoaches stopped to <br/>
renew both man and beast before continuing their journey. It became a <br/>
popular spot in the middle of the 18th century for certain unsavory <br/>
"Gentlemen of the Road~ namely highwaymen and horse thieves who were <br/>
led by the notorious Captain Lightfoot. The Captain and his friends had <br/>
plied their trade on the highways of England too successfully and for <br/>
reasons of personal health were forced to leave their native land. <br/>
Subsequently it was noticed that several travelers who left by stage for <br/>
Lancaster failed to arrive at their destination, and warnings were <br/>
posted advising travelers of the hazards of stage travel. With suspicion <br/>
leveled at it, the tavern became unpopular as a stopping place and <br/>
gradually fell into disrepair. A later owner investigating a stone in <br/>
the basement unearthed 13 skeletons  apparently the unfortunate <br/>
travelers who never made it to Lancaster. Some have said that when the <br/>
moon is over the river and the mist creeps in, if you listen carefully <br/>
you can hear the stagecoach rolling along and who knows  maybe even a <br/>
hoarse voice calling "stand and deliver.<br/>
<br/>
On April 21, 1676, Sudbury, Lancaster, and Marlborough were burned to <br/>
the ground by marauding Native Americans under the command of the <br/>
Wampanoag Chief, King Philip. A feeling of impending crisis sent the <br/>
Sudbury settlers to their six garrison houses. By 6:00 a.m. that fateful <br/>
day, a force of 1,000 to 1,500 Native Americans under King Philip <br/>
infiltrated the woods, burned the isolated farmhouses, and attacked the <br/>
garrisons. None of the garrison houses remain today, but the foundation <br/>
of the Haynes Garrison House can be seen on the adjacent town-owned <br/>
parcel. It was to the Haynes Garrison House that the two Concord <br/>
survivors of the Native American massacre at the Four-Arch Bridge (at <br/>
the Sudbury River in Wayland) fled for refuge. Here, the defenders <br/>
showed such courage and fierce determination to defend their homes, that <br/>
by 1:00 p.m., the Native Americans gave up and faded into the woods. <br/>
Perhaps the increasing frequency of musket fire from the direction of <br/>
Green Hill drew the discouraged Native Americans over Goodman Hill to <br/>
the main engagement. There, King Philip and his warriors finally <br/>
overwhelmed the colonials that afternoon, but failed to consolidate <br/>
their victory and began the slow descent into final defeat of the Native <br/>
American peoples in southern New England.<br/>
<br/>
I already have 4 boxes here, my Yggdrasil series, but there are lots of <br/>
nooks and crannies!<br/>
