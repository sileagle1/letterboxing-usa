How nice to have a brand new letterbox at the Sanbornton Rest Area on <br/>
I93 south in Tilton, NH.  We've been stopping there for years to <br/>
stretch our legs on the long trip home to RI, and can now hardly wait <br/>
for our next NH trip to have the added bonus of looking for a letterbox <br/>
there as well.<br/>
<br/>
The giant erratic at the southern end of the nature loop is actually <br/>
quite "famous".  Called Sanbornton Boulder, also nicknamed "Paul <br/>
Bunyan's Paperweight", and measuring some 25 feet tall and 93 feet <br/>
wide, it is one of the largest free-standing boulders in NH, outdone <br/>
only by Madison Boulder and perhaps a few others.  Definitely an <br/>
interesting stop for kids of all ages - especially now with the new LB!<br/>
