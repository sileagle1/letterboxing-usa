I'm just waking up after an EXCELLENT weekend get away to Moab Box on <br/>
the Rocks in Moab, Utah.  Thanks to all for the excellent fun and all <br/>
the great boxes placed for our searching pleasure.  I loved meeting <br/>
all of you.<br/>
<br/>
If you plant them, I will come....who travelled 600 plus miles one way <br/>
to see all of you great people.  We are addicted for sure.  Thank you <br/>
so much KAT, Kennamtn, Rivergeek and Y-Nought for putting this show on <br/>
and all the others too.  I'll email you all updates over the next week <br/>
or so.  Good times.<br/>
<br/>
Keep the boxes coming.<br/>

I wish I could convey how much we enjoyed this get-together.  Just <br/>
going to Moab is always great, but to combine it with the largest <br/>
number of letterboxers to ever gather in this entire region of the <br/>
country, well, you just can't beat that.<br/>
<br/>
There are some amazing letterboxers and impressive carvers around these <br/>
parts.  You should all come check these people out.  I so enjoyed the <br/>
exchanges.  That alone would have been worth the 9 or so hours of <br/>
driving to get there.  <br/>
<br/>
I was also impressed with the lengths and dedication of those in the <br/>
group.  We had letterboxers from Utah, Colorado, Arizona, Idaho, and <br/>
Oklahoma to name a few.  <br/>
<br/>
My only regret is knowing there are probably newly planted boxes that I <br/>
couldn't find b/c the clues couldn't have been posted yet.  I will have <br/>
to go back and find some more later.  Shucks! (:<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for an amazing time!<br/>
