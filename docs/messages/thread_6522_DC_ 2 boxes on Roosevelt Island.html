Washington, DC.  Several people had stamped in them over this <br/>
weekend, and we found them on July 28 in the very hot afternoon.  <br/>
The "Roosevelt Island" box is a little crunched and no longer <br/>
waterproof, but the book is in a baggy and seems to have stayed dry.<br/>
<br/>
The "Teddy's Box" book was full, and another letterboxer (not the <br/>
owner) had kindly placed a new book in the box.<br/>
