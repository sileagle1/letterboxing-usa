called "Beside The Bayside Band Shell" is really missing in Warren.<br/>
<br/>
I planted the box June 15, knowing that it would be in a place where <br/>
kids playing might find it although adults passing by probably would <br/>
not. The first such group of four boys signed in and re-hid the box <br/>
in a respectful manner, although they didn't get the idea about <br/>
secrecy and tried to draw attention to the box. The second coed <br/>
twosome was not so nice and wrote vulgar comments in the book in <br/>
addition to their names. I thought things had settled down once <br/>
school resumed, but sometime in September the box vanished, except <br/>
for the lid and the note about letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to wait a few weeks for the weather to get colder and the <br/>
time change to take place. Then I'll re-plant the box with a new <br/>
stamp like the old one. The clues and hiding place will stay the <br/>
same, although I'm looking for a better wedge rock.<br/>
<br/>
Dissapointing though it is to have a box go missing, it was worth it <br/>
beacuse a number of letterboxers came to visit- thanks everyone. I'll <br/>
post again when the new box is out there and hopefully the winter <br/>
will be more peaceful for it. If it disappears again it won't seem <br/>
worth it to try again in that place. Meanwhile, Latte Man and I are <br/>
planning a pair of boxes to plant on the quiet side of Warren and <br/>
we'll try to post them at the same time as Band Shell.<br/>
