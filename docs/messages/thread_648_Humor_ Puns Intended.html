                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everybody.  I realize that people have strong feelings about Email humor, <br/>
but I am offering these puns to the LBNA list in good conscience, because 1) <br/>
one of them has to do with compasses, and 2) another has to do with a Viking <br/>
(hi Erik!).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!  And if you really do object to my posting them, well---let me <br/>
know!!!!!!<br/>

Bonnie<br/>
In muggy muggy Massachusetts<br/>
P6F3<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Evidence has been found that William Tell and his family were avid<br/>
&gt;bowlers.<br/>
&gt;However, all the league records were unfortunately destroyed in a fire.<br/>
&gt;Thus<br/>
&gt;we'll never know for whom the Tells bowled.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A man rushed into the doctor's office and shouted, "Doctor!  I think I'm<br/>
&gt;shrinking!"  The doctor calmly responded,  "Now, settle down.  You'll<br/>
&gt;just<br/>
&gt;have to be a little patient."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Back  in the 1800's the Tates Watch Company of Massachusetts wanted to<br/>
&gt;produce other products, and since they already made the cases for pocket<br/>
&gt;watches, decided to market compasses for the pioneers traveling west.  It<br/>
&gt;turned out that although their watches were of the finest quality, their<br/>
&gt;compasses were so bad that people often ended up in Canada or Mexico<br/>
&gt;rather<br/>
&gt;than California. This, of course, is the origin of the expression, "He<br/>
&gt;who<br/>
&gt;has a Tates is lost!"<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A thief broke into the local police station and stole all the lavatory<br/>
&gt;equipment.  A spokesperson was quoted as saying, "We have absolutely<br/>
&gt;nothing<br/>
&gt;to go on."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;An Indian chief was feeling very sick, so he summoned the medicine man.<br/>
&gt;After a brief examination, the medicine man took out a long, thin strip<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;elk hide and gave it to the chief, instructing him to bite off, chew and<br/>
&gt;swallow one inch of the leather every day.  After a month, the medicine<br/>
&gt;man<br/>
&gt;returned to see how the chief was feeling.  The chief shrugged and said,<br/>
&gt;"The thong is ended, but the malady lingers on."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A famous Viking explorer returned home from a voyage and found his name<br/>
&gt;missing from the town register.  His wife insisted on complaining to the<br/>
&gt;local civic official who apologized profusely saying, "I must have taken<br/>
&gt;Lief off my census."<br/>
<br/>
&gt;A skeptical anthropologist was cataloging South American folk remedies<br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;the assistance of a tribal brujo who indicated that the leaves of a<br/>
&gt;particular fern were a sure cure for any case of constipation.  When the<br/>
&gt;anthropologist expressed his doubts, the brujo looked him in the eye and<br/>
&gt;said, "Let me tell you, with fronds like these, who needs enemas?"<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There were three Indian squaws.  One slept on a deer skin, one slept on<br/>
&gt;an<br/>
&gt;elk skin, and the third slept on a hippopotamus skin.  All three became<br/>
&gt;pregnant, and the first two each had a baby boy.  The one who slept on<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;hippopotamus skin had twin boys.  This goes to prove that the squaw of<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;hippopotamus is equal to the sons of the squaws of the other two hides.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;Thanks, Bonnie!  No objections at all. I printed out your list and<br/>
&gt;took it into breakfast. Sandy was serving up bagels with some Nova<br/>
&gt;Scotian smoked salmon! The first ones were a little off, but the next<br/>
&gt;batch was great, and  I read your e-mail as we ate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
