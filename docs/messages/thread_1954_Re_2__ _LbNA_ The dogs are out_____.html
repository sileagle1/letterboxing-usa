<br/>
What a wonderful posting !<br/>
<br/>
I loved the tale of your adventure taking Travis discovering<br/>
Letterboxing...The whole bit, the excitement, the learning of new words,<br/>
and the opening up of awareness and understanding of the world that<br/>
brings, (EG I assume that the new word "Serpentine" was either when you<br/>
found a sample of the mineral , or maybe a big old winding  S shaped<br/>
valley): <br/>
<br/>
Don't you think, that in that special moment when we are able to identify<br/>
and name new things and realise that we can see and appreciate stuff on<br/>
our old planet which was there all the time, but we just didn't see it ;<br/>
is like a special gift and so much joy ?; especially for kids ..of all<br/>
ages ? <g><br/>
<br/>
I learn new stuff from each letterboxer I meet on every outing !<br/>
<br/>
Your story captured that sense of discovery so well for me !<br/>
<br/>
Just a wonderful tale imho<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed reading of the other discoveries you made on your outing too,<br/>
like finding out what are Travis' favourite things at school.  It made it<br/>
a purely delightful tale.. Once again I remember why I enjoy this simple<br/>
naive old hobby...<grin> <br/>
<br/>
These are magic moments and you recorded em so well !<br/>
<br/>
Many many thanks for sharing them.<br/>
<br/>
...But just one thing more !!!....................!!<br/>
<br/>
All this "cloak and dagger" seems to me to be a sad, lost "Letterboxing<br/>
moment",  imho !!  <br/>
<br/>
Please let me explain !  !! ! <br/>
<br/>
Saying , .."Are you kind of a tall guy with a beard?"..and  "I have short<br/>
dark hair and glasses,and I was wearing a dorky hat" .... is all a great<br/>
missed opportunity....imho !!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On Dartmoor we'd be saying " Hi are you carrying a Traveller ? ", and<br/>
suddenly you'd know if you'd met another boxer ...and hey presto "up goes<br/>
your X count"...(We call it a T count of course ! <grin>) <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you all need a better "password" or "pass-phrase" than our one<br/>
<lol>..Down deep in Portland letterboxland, the kids yelling out , "Hi are<br/>
you carrying a Traveller ? " might sound just too weird, and scare away<br/>
the locals ! !!<br/>
<br/>
But if you do invest in a "group question" all over LbNA land it would<br/>
make the connection between letterboxers "in the wild" just so much easier<br/>
!  jmho <g><br/>
<br/>
Just a thought from across the water ! <br/>
<br/>
Once again....a tale of a great outing....Just the most golden times of<br/>
Letterboxing imho!<br/>
<br/>
Savour em well ....They are magic moments imho !  Thank You !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing !<br/>

I feel so honored that The Moorland Wizard responded to my comments<br/>
about letterboxing for dogs with Travis. <br/>
<br/>
This is such a new and exciting deal for me and in all honesty I'm<br/>
absolutely SHOCKED this hasn't caught on as big for us out here as it<br/>
has for those on the East Coast of the USA.  I think Der Mad Stamper and<br/>
Thom Cheney have done a great job of stoking the embers out here for the<br/>
past three years.<br/>
<br/>
I was on the website checking out clues for those New England states and<br/>
little old Rhode Island seems to have 72 letterboxes.  I'm generally not<br/>
good at numbers, but looking at a map and seeing how big Rhode Island is<br/>
compared to Oregon (not to mention the Pacific NW as a whole) just makes<br/>
me realize what really wonderful opportunities lie ahead for us out here<br/>
and those who visit!<br/>
<br/>
As for missed opportunity on the trail, that's no joke!  We're just<br/>
stumbling along out here, not really expecting to meet up with fellow<br/>
letterboxers, as a general rule, I think. So to think we'd meet up on<br/>
the trail the way people seem to in Dartmoor and parts East of here must<br/>
means we're progressing.  Maybe it's time for me to carve up a<br/>
"Traveller" and carry it with me always or something and consider<br/>
trading images with fellow letterboxers the way you all do in the UK.<br/>
What's the etiquette on that?  I'd better get reading.  <br/>
<br/>
Graham...will you be coming to our letterboxing summit here in the<br/>
Portland area in April?  It will probably be a terrific event if Thom is<br/>
working on it.  <br/>
<br/>
I really hope we get a good showing of letterboxers from all over for<br/>
this Earth Day thing.  We'd get the privelege of meeting you all, and<br/>
you would (if you haven't already) be introduced to one of the most<br/>
beautiful urban and suburban areas of the USA -- I'm not bragging, now,<br/>
it's true.  If you don't believe me, then I dare you to come out here<br/>
and prove me wrong!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the kind words.  Happy Letterboxing to all!!!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
