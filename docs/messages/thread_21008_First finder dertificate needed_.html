Can anyone e-mail me a copy of a first finder certificate that I can <br/>
print.  I have a box going out Monday and am in need of a printable <br/>
certificate to include in the box.  I tried the files section, but <br/>
they printed fuzzy.  Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!<br/>

There isn't any 'official' first finder's certificate. In fact, there was no such thing until a <br/>
couple of years back. I have never used them but those that do have made up their <br/>
own versions. Feel free to create something of your own. Funhog<br/>

sometimes I have an extra special one, sometimes it's super simple. It all<br/>
depends on how much time I have available, how much effort I've put into the<br/>
box, and whether it's a box I'm putting out by myself or if it's a Brat Pack<br/>
box. Sometimes the firsties has to do with the theme of the stamp, sometimes<br/>
it has to do with my "signature", and sometimes it just has to do with<br/>
what's available.<br/>

Do what feels right to you!<br/>
