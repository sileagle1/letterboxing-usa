<br/>
For those of you that don't remember a couple months ago I broke my ankle<br/>
and foot letterboxing.  Yesterday I received in the mail The Purple Heart<br/>
Letterbox, awarded and sent to those that have been injured in the line of<br/>
duty (letterboxing duty).  I've stamped in at this point and the letterbox<br/>
is ready to send off to the next recipient.  Unfortunately I was away for<br/>
awhile and I think I missed the post about who was in line to receive it<br/>
next.  So if you would gladly stand up and wave your hands in the air I will<br/>
toss The Purple Heart Letterbox your way.<br/>
<br/>

That would be me. I got bit by a spider while out<br/>
checking on a box, and my hand blew up so badly that I<br/>
couldn't use it for most of a week. The list decided<br/>
that I was sufficiently injured enough to earn a<br/>
Purple Heart. <br/>

Certainly sounds like it to me. Could you tell us more<br/>
about what happened to you? What does the rest of the<br/>
list think?<br/>

  My daughter and I had collected our stamp from a Wildcat Canyon hike and were on our way back.  We had about 1 1/2 miles to go.  I turned around to look where we had been and stepped off an edge of the path.  It was only about a 3" drop, but enough for the ankle to totally collapse.  It was a very long, painful hike back to the van.  Then a long drive home (my daughter's only 12, although she would have loved to drive).  Then used the R.I.C.E. method until the next day and went to the Dr. with x-rays, no fracture.  It's been a long healing process but I just started running again today.  Took my first hike last Thursday, back in business !  Linda<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Can the Purple Heart Letterbox be awarded for an injury <br/>
suffered "ante-awardum"?  In January of 2002 (see posting #9802), <br/>
during my lunch hour I hurried over to the parking area for Bowers <br/>
Springs Letterbox in Harvard,Ma. That winter was a mild one with <br/>
frequent thawing temperatures that turned snow cover to ice sheets.  <br/>
With compass and clues in hand, only 50 paces from the car, I lost my <br/>
footing on the ice.  Bracing myself with my free hand, I took a slam-<br/>
dunk, breaking both arm bones in my wrist. Harvard is about 12 miles <br/>
from the nearest hospital but I figured it would be quicker to drive <br/>
myself than to seek help to get me there.  So I drove with my right <br/>
arm on the arm rest. After two shots of morphine the orthopedic <br/>
surgeon reset the bones. Three and a half weeks later, arm in cast, I <br/>
returned to Bowers Springs with The Lazy Letterboxer to claim the <br/>
letterbox. Since then, I've equipped myself with clampons, if needed, <br/>
for icy conditions. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this doesn't open up a whole new can of worms for debate. <br/>
Just asking.<br/>

Heck yeah, I'd say that breaking both wrists (even prior to the creation of <br/>
the Purple Heart) qualifies you for receiving the stamp that no one hopes to <br/>
get.  I've lost track--who currently has it?  Unless someone else is currently <br/>
waiting, maybe gbheron can send a snail-mail address to you off-list, and the <br/>
Purple Heart will wing its way to its next victim...er, winner.<br/>
