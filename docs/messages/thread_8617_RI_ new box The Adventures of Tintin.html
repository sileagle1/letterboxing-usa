THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN LETTERBOX<br/>
West Kingston, RI<br/>
Washington County<br/>
<br/>
Box by: Laurette<br/>
Placed by: Laurette &amp; Wanda <br/>
Date: October 10, 2002<br/>
Rating: long walk on old forest roads (about 4 miles)<br/>
Etc: make sure to wear blaze orange during hunting season<br/>
<br/>
Driving directions: From 138 in West Kingston, RI turn west on Liberty Lane.  Follow Liberty Lane to its end at the railroad tracks.  Go left on the dirt road past the HQ (where trail maps for the Great Swamp may be available) to the end of the road where there is a spacious parking lot. The trail begins beyond the barred gate at the far end of the lot.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Follow the trail beyond the gate to the first major fork at the Dr. John Mulleedy marker.  Take a right.  Continue on this trail until the next major fork at which you will go left.  This trail will lead under the power lines and along some fields.  You may be able to see the impoundment off to the right.  At the next convergence, take the trail to the left, which will eventually lead down to the George McCahey marker.  At the marker, go right and follow this trail down to Worden's Pond.  At the water's edge, you will see an old seaplane hangar.  Across from the hangar is a big rock under a beech tree.  Climb up on the rock and stand next to the beech tree.  Go 12 steps due north and peek under a rock (on the hangar side).  The view of the pond is lovely.  It is a good spot for a snack and some exploration.  When you are ready, head back up the trail the way you came.  This time when you pass the McCahey Marker, keep straight.  You will pass through a large cluster of American holly, back under the power lines and end up back at the Mulleedy Marker.  Take the path to your right back to your car.<br/>
