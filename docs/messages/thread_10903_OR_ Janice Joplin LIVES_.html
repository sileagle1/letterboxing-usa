Forest Park Musician Series, west of Portland, Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
For those fans of Jancie Joplin who thought she was gone, think <br/>
again!  She is alive and well living in a little box along the Leif <br/>
Erikson Trail (old defunct road) in northern Forest Park.<br/>
<br/>
We were surprised to see that we were the 1st to bag this series, but <br/>
I'm sure there will be others now as the stamps all make a nice <br/>
addition to our log book and will to yours too.<br/>
<br/>
If you are having problems solving some of the clues, as Janis would <br/>
say, just "Try A Little Harder"!  ;o)<br/>

&gt; On December 8, 2002 I (Brett) went for a hike with Simon &amp; <br/>
&gt; Garfunkel, BB King, Lyle Lovett, and (very oddly since I thought <br/>
she <br/>
&gt; was dead) Janis Joplin in Portland's Forest Park, Multnomah County, <br/>
&gt; Oregon. Apparently my company wasn't that good since they kept <br/>
&gt; disappearing everytime I turned around. I think they are still out <br/>
&gt; there in the park. Perhaps the clues at this URL will help you <br/>
track <br/>
&gt; them down.<br/>
