                    <html><body><p>Cara,
</p><p>I have done a fair amount of woodcarving using larger gouges and carving knives.No matter how well you practice proper techniques for using these tools, when you are working on a small piece, it is much easier to get in trouble. Are you familiar with inserting an appropriately sized "stop cut" with a knife at the point where an area you are carving ends? This helps to prevent the tool from slipping beyond where you intended to stop and into your hand. I have never carved linoleum so do not know if that makes practical sense or not. Some wood carvers also attach a "handle" to their work. This can be anything from a dowel rod that you hold with a screw in one end that screws into the carving piece rather than holding the piece itself. I believe there are also specialized devices you can buy that do this.
</p><p>With regard to cutting yourself, below are two links to products that may be very helpful to you.

Here is a link for you for hand guards pertaining to woodcarving.  I've used<br/>
the finger guards, they're cheap and work well when carving wood.  I'm sure<br/>
they'll work fine with the linoleum!<br/>

For wood carving, there are leather finger guards that you can wear.  I'm<br/>
sure that they would also work well for carving linoleum.<br/>

 They're 'pull' type cutters, so they're less likely to cause a nasty cut. <br/>
The blades will probably fit your existing handle.  You can check them out at:<br/>
