You may want to get on the talk list if you are not already.<br/>
For this go to http://www.pclink.com/elf/mail.htm and follow<br/>
the instructions for joining the discussion group on the<br/>
left side of that page.<br/>
Also, landmark clues are what I use too, so that sounds good<br/>
to me.  In fact, I think those are the easiest to deal with<br/>
(and perhaps the easiest for kids.  But bearings and some of<br/>
the other methods can be interesting and fun.  Choose your<br/>
favorite way to describe the location.<br/>
<br/>
We have an input form at http://www.poclink.com/elf/inform.htm<br/>
you can also get to it at the main page http://www.pclink.com/elf<br/>
by clicking on the masthead.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, good to have you aboard.  Keep asking questions.<br/>
Spokane is in eastern Washington?  Mountainous?  Big City?<br/>
Rural?  Population?  Too many questions?  Talk to you later.<br/>

&gt; simply send them to you and you stick them on the map?<br/>
&gt;     What i plan to do is a simple one or two here in Spokane at points<br/>

&gt;     I don't plan to use compass bearings or fancy pacing instructions,<br/>
&gt; but rather sightings from visual landmarks.  I guess that's ok from some<br/>
&gt; of the clues i've read on your map.<br/>
&gt;     I'm sure i'll have more questions as i stumble along, but i'm sure<br/>

&gt; What do you want to know Jim?  I'll help you any way I can if<br/>
&gt; you want to get started.  We don't have any boxes placed in<br/>
&gt; Washington yet.  You would be the first I am aware of.<br/>

&gt; &gt;    I'm not much of a hand at this computer stuff, and consequently<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; reasons i don't fathom, the map on the net page for "Letterbox USA"<br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn't tell me what if any boxes or clues were available in my<br/>
&gt; area<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Spokane Wa.).<br/>
&gt; &gt;    I've been thinking for some time (since reading the Smithsonian<br/>
&gt; &gt; article) that leterboxing would be a fun thing to do.  Maybe i can<br/>
&gt; &gt; gather enough info from this group to either get involved here, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; figure out how to start a group up.<br/>

Welcome aboard, Jim:<br/>
	If you have any questions, just float them over the talk-list, and<br/>
someone (or many) will offer suggestions.  Raad through the "Getting<br/>
Started" and "FAQ's: on the web page, which cover many of the aspects.  <br/>
<br/>
	Do you plan to hand-carve stamps? If this is new to you, Mitch Klink<br/>
has done a nice bit about it, also within the web site. And, check out,<br/>
if you haven't already, a site called "Carving Consortium" for great<br/>
examples of carved stamps, where to get supplies, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Yup, you are the "pioneer" for the NW corner of the US. The letterbox<br/>
"Field of Dreams" motto - "Put out a Letterbox, and they will come" is<br/>
apt - just get started and it will grow around you.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>
<br/>
Erik Davis<br/>

     I can't take enough time to answer all your questions, but perhaps<br/>
you might gain some Spokane insight from our office Website at<br/>
http://www.wsrgm.com.<br/>
 There's a bit in there about me too, thought its seriously outdated. <br/>
     If you check out the pictures, you'll see a river runs through it<br/>
(Spokane) and that there a pretty noisy and wet falls in mid-town.  I'm<br/>
probably going to be placing a box at an appropriate falls view point<br/>
(tis all a part of "Riverfront Park" the home of the '74 World's Fair).<br/>
     Say, let me tell you what i'm thinking.  I'm thinking i'll place<br/>
the two boxes (Rubbermaid sammich boxes i picked up yesterday) with<br/>
stamps marked with consecutive numbers, then continue the order as i<br/>
make more.  Your hints at stamp making are well taken.  I prefer<br/>
original artwork and hope to do something worthy.  <br/>
           Do you know if there's a sister organization in Canada eh?  <br/>
         Thanks again Dan          Jim<br/>

Your an attorney.  Cool.  I browsed your business site.  Very<br/>
professional looking.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   There's a bit in there about me too, thought its seriously outdated.<br/>
<br/>
Can I ask are you married or have kids?  Is that too personal?<br/>
Its OK if you don't want to say.  What were your Boeing illustrations<br/>
like?  Do you have a plan for a 747 stamp or anything like that?<br/>
<br/>

That sounds good to me.  I'm doing something similar with a<br/>
baseball series.  Let me know when you have something to post<br/>
(either by email or you can use the input form at<br/>
http://www.pclink.,com/elf/inform.htm)  It'll be nice to see<br/>
something in Spokane cuz its a different sort of place... seems<br/>
to me you're right on the edge of Montana if memory serves me<br/>
right...  I made it to the eastern edge of Montana once but<br/>
never entered in more than a mile or two.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Do you know if there's a sister organization in Canada eh?<br/>
<br/>
Eh, Canada no letterboxes are there from that I know.  But we<br/>
have room on the map for them.  If you know somebody from there<br/>
who is interested I'll see what I can do to broaden the map so<br/>
they can be on our site.  I actually have a world map ready<br/>
to try, but I need a reason to apply it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your enthusiasm and your interest in what we're<br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
