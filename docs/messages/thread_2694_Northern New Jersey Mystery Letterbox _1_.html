Somewhere in Northern New Jersey<br/>
<br/>
Clues:      Difficult<br/>
Terrain:    Easy<br/>
Time:       15 Minutes from the start point <br/>
<br/>
Notes: This is a rather large stamp that requires at least a 2x3 inkpad.  You <br/>
will need to press very firmly (it was the second stamp I did, so please <br/>
don't expect a work of art.) on all parts of the back of the stamp for the <br/>
image to come out.  <br/>
<br/>
The "Continents of the World" is the place to be.<br/>
Africa at Cornu (1682) is a statue you will see.<br/>
Birds in winter head in the direction you need to go.<br/>
At the gravel road, you'll go left, that's something you'll need to know.<br/>
A small trail on the right will appear.<br/>
You'll take that trail and a small stream you will hear.<br/>
A large rock bridge you will then cross.<br/>
Go to the right or you will be at a loss.<br/>
Follow the trail until you cross another viaduct.<br/>
Underneath the span on the left is what you're searching for, good luck.<br/>
