evening, after a -- let us say -- "persistent" search!<br/>
<br/>
 From the initial starting point, the clues are a bit vague. There are so <br/>
very many benches and signs in the area, and one can't read any of the <br/>
signs from a distance. After several false starts down the hill in various <br/>
directions, trying to reach a bench on the correct number of paces, I gave <br/>
up and just looked for the "sorry" sign. Once I had that, finding the <br/>
correct location was not difficult -- but the box was EXTREMELY well <br/>
hidden. After poking about in the gorse, brambles and thistles with a bit <br/>
of driftwood for a good 15 minutes I moved some pieces of wood under a good <br/>
deal of dried cut grass and thistles and was elated to see a plastic lid <br/>
peeking up at me.<br/>
<br/>
I never did make the first set of paces from the Beacon to the rest stop <br/>
match up. I suspect the number may be wrong on the clue. A compass <br/>
direction to the "sorry" sign might be easier; I had little trouble from <br/>
that point on.<br/>
