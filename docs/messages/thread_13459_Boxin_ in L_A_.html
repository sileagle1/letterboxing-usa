Incredible stamps and the Marina Pacifica Plumbing Problem hiding <br/>
spot is genius! Naples Canal Conundrum stamp also very, very nice!<br/>
Gwen &amp; Don's signal hill in good shape, what a view!<br/>
We went to our new plants Strange Stamps series and the second box <br/>
was out of it's hiding spot and thrown all over the ground. We <br/>
retrived the stamp and log book and have taken it in for repairs. <br/>
Hope to get it back in place before next weekend. The tree it was <br/>
hidden in might be a popular place for kids to play so we may move <br/>
the spot. The other two boxes are alive and well.<br/>
Our Lizards Crossing in Whittier, the first box you need to find the <br/>
1 mile marker to get to the box, some one has removed the one mile <br/>
marker. We will re-work the clues, second and third boxes are fine.<br/>
It seems the second box has been missed by alot of people, we are <br/>
going to re-work the clues. For those of you who have found it our <br/>
hats are off to you.<br/>
Box on,<br/>
