                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would hope that no one frowns upon this but I wanted to give it a <br/>
try. With all the hush hush business we do to keep letterboxing off <br/>
the radar as much as possible, this would not interfer with the inner <br/>
working of what we do. Once a year, starting this past year, I have <br/>
brought letterboxers and community together for Project White Sands. <br/>
Letterboxers were welcome with open arms. Now I have taken on another <br/>
cause. If there is anyone out there that thinks all we do is litter <br/>
the woods, lets show them other wise. <br/>
<br/>
The cause is called - Help Giovanni!<br/>
<br/>
Baby Giovanni was born July 24, 2006 an apparently healthy baby to <br/>
Christina M. Poulicakos and Michael A. Guglielmo. After six-weeks <br/>
home, Giovanni had an elevated fever and was taken to his doctor. He <br/>
was sent home under the belief he simply had a cold. After several <br/>
days his temp persisted, he wasn't eating and he was very irritable <br/>
so he was taken back to the doctor. Since then he has been in and out <br/>
of the hopsital, on different drugs to try and kick this illness he <br/>
had, but to no avail. Soon he would be transfered to Boston <br/>
Children's Hospital in Massachusetts. He is in need of a bone marrow <br/>
transplant in which the insurance company will not pay. The family of <br/>
baby Giovanni has reached out to the community for help raising money <br/>
for the surgery.<br/>
<br/>
This holiday saeson, my employer at Sal's Pizza in Concord, NH, had <br/>
come up with an unusual idea this year. He had done this before, but <br/>
he had given each of his employees $100 dollars to donate to someone <br/>
or a family we do not know. After some searching, I found my cause. <br/>
For most of you that follow my blog, I lost a son a few years ago. He <br/>
had become ill and spent time at Boston Children's Hospital as well, <br/>
but for a heart condition. When I saw the news report on WMUR, I knew <br/>
what I had to do. For me, it was a no brainer. My money went to a <br/>
worthy cause.<br/>
<br/>
With the permission from the parents, I am allowed to post this in <br/>
hopes to draw in more donations for the family. They live in Belmont, <br/>
NH and it is a 1.5 hour drive to Boston everyday. You don't have to <br/>
if you don't want to, but it doesn't hurt for me to try. Anything you <br/>
have to donate will be enough. All the information about baby <br/>
Giovanni and where to donate, will be on the website <br/>
www.helpgiovanniguglielmo.org<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
