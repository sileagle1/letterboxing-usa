I went to check on the boxes today after reports of missing boxes.  <br/>
Sadly, the first shield was gone.  However, the other one was there, <br/>
not exactly where I had placed it.  It had been found by one boxer.  <br/>
I placed it back where it was originally and have revised the clues <br/>
slightly.  My apologies to those who searched in vain for those <br/>
shields.<br/>
