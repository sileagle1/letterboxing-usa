only to find it stark raving GONE.  Not wishing the same fate upon #2 <br/>
(a much harder stamp to replicate), we made the decision to pull it <br/>
from Cantigny Park altogether.  We are currently searching for new <br/>
l.b. homes as we re-carve #3.  <br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to this question: Does anyone know of any parks in <br/>
Chicagoland that are host to beehives and/or lots of flowers?? We'd <br/>
like to put our bees in as natural a habitat as possible!<br/>

The Chicago Botanic Garden in Glencoe has a beehive exhibit in the <br/>
fruit and vegetable garden area. That's a pretty high traffic area, <br/>
but you might be able to write up clues that would direct people <br/>
first to the bee exhibit, and then lead them on a tour through the <br/>
gardens out to a less-central spot (like along the river). If you <br/>
decide to check out this possibility, I'd definitely clear it with <br/>
staff--among other things, I'd imagine even the more "natural" areas <br/>
of the gardens receive more attention and grooming/maintenance than <br/>
your typical semi-feral state park, for example. Another possibility <br/>
would be to plant the box itself a little further south in the <br/>
Skokie Lagoons area, which is accessible by the North Branch bicycle <br/>
path, which runs all the way south to the city, for avid <br/>
hiker/biker/boxers.<br/>
