County, Ohio (Chillicothe). Difficulty: Easy. This letterbox can be <br/>
found in Grandview Cemetery in Chillicothe, Ohio. CLUES: Follow the <br/>
entrance road into the cemetery. Making no turns, at about .1 mile <br/>
past the entrance gate, you should be able to look to your left and <br/>
see a gray monument with 8 columns a short distance away. From this <br/>
vantage point, you can also see a large monument in the shape of a <br/>
tall white cross ,which appears to the right of the other monument. <br/>
You need to go to the monument with the 8 columns. At its <br/>
southeasternmost corner, take a reading of 183 degrees. Go 15 paces <br/>
at that heading to a large Maple tree. Check out the base of the <br/>
tree on its western side.<br/>
