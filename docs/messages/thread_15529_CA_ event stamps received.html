of them in my snail mailbox today! Let it be known that I have received from <br/>
Turtle Mc Q the following: Kmartha, The Roving Pacific Northwest Event Stamp and <br/>
Spring Chick's A Little Birdie Told Me event stamp.<br/>
<br/>
They will be well taken care of, brought to the Nor Cal gathering on Saturday <br/>
(where they will surely be oohed and aahed over) and then mailed to Tom Noone <br/>
(I'LL NEED HIS ADDRESS, OF COURSE!) for his September 20th event. They will <br/>
next go to Sir Balthazar for the <br/>
So. Cal event on October 4th.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for getting the parcel to me in time!<br/>
