It does make me wonder about the people who have pictures to enter your order, and _still_ can't do it right.  Are they graphically challenged??  Or do we need to provide interpreters to explain what I want so they can find the right picture? <s><br/>
<br/>
But honestly, picture menus can't do special orders unless they have pictures for every type of order, every contingency. I can't imagine the array on the keyboard for a hamburger well-done with no salt, no pickles, light on the onions, extra mayo, add mustard, or any other combination we could think up to "have it our way."  That's just one item and some options. Somewhere along the way, words would have to be the more appropriate choice.  <br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I've read a bit of this thread, and just can't resist chiming in.  Those of you who know how I blather on but are still reading may opt to delete now.<br/>
<br/>
Just to add my additional 2 cents plus tax:<br/>
<br/>
My school system was a very good one.  I'm sure they followed all the state regs and curriculum. Many a grad became a successful professional. But I was never taught to make change. Never.  Making change is different than adding and subtracting money on a ditto.  Luckily, I had someone show me the register who could explain it well and I picked it up quickly.  That probably had more to do with her ability to explain how to count up to the next largest increment than with my ability to do math operations in my head. (I'm intelligent but math does not come easy for me.) Smooth, fast cashiering had a  lot had to do with rote memory, too. Long before the days of combos and value meals, people ordered the same groups of foods all the time, so once you knew the prices of the most common orders, one could amaze customers with fast accuracy.  As someone mentioned, the 5% tax seemed a bit easier than some other tax rates.  And the menus were much more simple.<br/>
<br/>
There were no items listed on the register, there were no pictures, and tax required you to figure it out or consult the chart, enter it manually and hit TAX instead of ITEM.  There were no itemized receipts. If a customer challenged you and your math, you had to do the math out on a scratch pad.  Most of us cashiers (they called us "counter girls") were rarely wrong; the customer was either dense, or argumentative, or needed to see it in black and white.  Some were out to bilk or flim-flam you.  There will always be people trying to get something for free.  The job was fast and physically demanding.  I think it was easy compared to jobs I had after that with more complicated machines.  And I wouldn't want to try to do it at my age now.  I forget more than I retain.<br/>
<br/>
But nowadays it seems you can be slow and relatively dim-witted, have no people skills, lack basic understanding of American English, have questionable hygiene, poor grooming, and still keep your job in fast food services.  You might even get to be Employee of the Month.  I still wouldn't want to do it!  It's just one of those fast turnover places that make entry into the job market easier.  I try to remind myself that even the worst clerk is at least trying to _earn_.<br/>
<br/>
This does not imply that people who like to use technology to keep track of things are dumb.  If you are the sort who likes to know exactly how many of what type of boxes you have found or not found, but don't feel like figuring it out with pencil math, a tool to do it for you is a great idea.  I don't think, however, it's anybody's job to provide that tool for you.  But someone probably will!  Someone will step up to the plate and figure out a new spread sheet or computer program that has everything you could want, and will tweak it for you when you hit a snag.  They will do so because there is a "need" and they have the skill. They like the challenge and have the smarts to do it.  They will probably do so graciously and quickly, in their free time. <br/>
<br/>
It will be yours to use or not to use, free of charge. Why?<br/>
<br/>
Cuz some 'boxers and tech geeks and bean counters are cool like that.<br/>
<br/>
There is so much talent here that people share freely it makes me wonder what it is about letterboxing that draws such extraordinary people.<br/>
