                    <html><body><div><div>     Tried the suggested vinegar transfer technique last night, and got good results with it.  This is <em>really </em>great, because not only does it save a trip to the copy shop (you can use your inkjet prints), but acetone is a hazardous solvent.  I'm happy to have found a benign alternative.  Don't want to come off as a street preacher, but if you are using acetone, read and follow all the directions.  It is highly volitile (will flash if a spark is present) and is readily absorbed directly into the body through the skin.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>     The only problem I had was that the vinegar ate the paper.  Trish's suggestion about using a thicker paper might help, but rubbing quickly reduced it to mush.  I wet the Mastercarve with vinegar, set the transfer sheet on, gently blotted the back with vinegar to saturate the paper... then pressed it with a flat wooden block for about a minute.  the results rivaled what I get with the acetone method.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>     Worth a try... half the fun is experimentation, anyway.</div>
