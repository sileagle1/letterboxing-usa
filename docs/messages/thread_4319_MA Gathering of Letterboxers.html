I'd like to propose a Saturday night dinner at Barbers Crossing in <br/>
Sterling MA, which is at the intersection of Rts 12 and I-190, two <br/>
minutes from Rt 2, and ten minutes from Rt 495 or the Pike. They have <br/>
a wide selection of foods, and reasonable prices. I would like to <br/>
propose February 16th as the date, with Feb 23 as the "snow date" in <br/>
case of inclement weather. <br/>
<br/>
Please RSVP to me directly at Khatru24@yahoo.com by Feb 14th and I <br/>
will call the restaurant for the final reservation. I would like make <br/>
a preliminary reservation this week if I receive enough responses to <br/>
make this event a "go", so please reply early if possible.<br/>
<br/>
If this date is not good for you, I'm sure there will be other <br/>
gatherings soon, as other local boxers have expressed interest in <br/>
hosting one. <br/>
