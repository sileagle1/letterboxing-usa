<br/>
I received you email regarding the difficulties you are having <br/>
finding this box, but was unable to return mail to you at the address <br/>
provided.  If you sent the message from work, they may have some sort <br/>
of firewall that my email cannot penetrate.  At any rate, below is my <br/>
response to you.<br/>
<br/>
 I think I read before that you already found the 1st and<br/>
2nd stamps.  The combination of these two clues used together,<br/>
lead you to the letterbox.  The first stamp shows the number of<br/>
paces you need to take at the "mystery degree" heading.  The<br/>
mystery degree, comes from the second stamp.<br/>
<br/>
 If you are ending back up at the bench, it sounds to me like<br/>
you are using the wrong heading after finding the second stamp.<br/>
<br/>
 Does this make sense and do you think it will help you?  Please<br/>
let me know.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
 Mark<br/>
