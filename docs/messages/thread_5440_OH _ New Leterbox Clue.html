<br/>
Location: Lunken Airport Walk/Bike Track<br/>
<br/>
Address: Wilmer Road,  Between SR125 and Kellogg Ave in Mt. Washington<br/>
<br/>
Level: 1 Easy<br/>
<br/>
Need: Stamp Pad, Pen<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Well, You use to feel like a MillionAIR when going to the trail BUT because of 9-11, You get to park in a<br/>
gravel lot that looks like a 5 year old built it with his tonka truck. <br/>
<br/>
 Once you park your car, You head up the hill to the trail. You will want to go right on to the trail.<br/>
<br/>
 As you walk you will notice that you are on top of a Earth Flood wall. You will walk till you come to a tree stump on your right side, You will note it's the only one that is about 5 feet tall.<br/>
<br/>
 This Stump is 11 Paces (pace=2 steps) behind a white 270 marked on the black top on the left hand side of the trail.<br/>
<br/>
 From that stump you will want to walk Dead North 0' About 11 paces. You will see a tree in the shape of a V,  The Lunken Letterbox is under the tree.<br/>
