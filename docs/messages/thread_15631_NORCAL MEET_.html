accolades!! My family and I had an absolute blast at this event! We <br/>
were indeed fortunate to meet some of the West Coast "luminaries" in <br/>
the letterboxing world, who spared nothing in immediately making us <br/>
welcome, and bringus into the fold! <br/>
<br/>
As a result, my kids have their own stamps now! We also were <br/>
fortunate to be able to pick up 11 of the 15 boxes (including <br/>
Princess Lea's infamous Schoolhouse Rock #4!) We had a super time <br/>
with Esmecat and JavaLord (thanks for the lattes!!) and with Todd and <br/>
Pam. We had a lot of laughs and have some wonderful memories!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all the organisers! We hope to run across you guys <br/>
again from time to time!<br/>
