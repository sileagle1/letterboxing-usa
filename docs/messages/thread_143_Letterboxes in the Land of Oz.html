I hope you all enjoyed the holidays as much as I did.  I made it back to my<br/>
childhood home in Kansas to visit family for two weeks.  It was a wonderful<br/>
visit, and I even managed to place two letterboxes while I was there.  Got<br/>
them out in the afternoon of December 31.  Maybe they were the last two US<br/>
letterboxes of the year?  At any rate, they are certainly the first<br/>
letterboxes in Kansas.<br/>
<br/>
The Kirwin Lake letterboxes are relatively easy to get to, but they are in a<br/>
very remote part of the country near the tiny (population 276) lakeside town<br/>
of Kirwin, in Northwest Kansas.<br/>
<br/>
The clues are at:<br/>
<a href="http://members.aol.com/letterboxr/kirwin.htm"><br/>
http://members.aol.com/letterboxr/kirwin.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Dan, the coordinates for the Kirwin Lake letterboxes are:<br/>
39.66982 N, 99.12277 W<br/>
<br/>
PS - Wouldn't it be great to have letterboxes in every state by the end of the<br/>
century?<br/>

Way to Go! Good concept for the rest of us to remember - no need to<br/>
limit letterbox locations to those near home - most of us go someplace<br/>
else during the course of a year - why not leave a trail of letterboxes<br/>
in your wake.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the image did not come up when I used the location from your e-mail<br/>
post - are you aware? Because, I'm anxious to see more work of "Der Mad<br/>
STamper"<br/>
<br/>
Yup, I agreee - all 50 states by YK2, and, maybe, 200 boxes? Actually,<br/>
I'll bet that we top 200, but 2000 is unlikely (that's about 50 for each<br/>
person on this mailing list )<br/>
<br/>
I sent out 5 "kits" for Christmas gifts - included a description, plus a<br/>
few pages from the web page, a container and several stamps, and to<br/>
those unlikely to have cutter tools, a basic lino cutter set. Haven't<br/>
heard back yet, however.<br/>
