<p>Route 63 parking lot to Letterbox; 3 miles</p>
<p>Route 64 parking lot to Letterbox; 1  miles</p>
<p>Meadowview Park to Letterbox;  mile</p><b>
</b><p>Difficulty: Moderate. Hilly, road crossings and paved except for a  mile 
of packed gravel. </p><b>
</b><p>Directions: Take exit 17 off of <b>I</b>84.</p>
<dir>
<dir><b>
</b><p>Westbound; the exit brings you right onto Route 64 West. When you reach 
the junction </p>
<p>of Route 63, continue straight on Route 64 for 1.3 miles and turn left onto 
Chase Road for </p>
<p>the <b>Chase Road parking lot</b>. Continue along Route 64 until you reach 
the top of the hill </p>
<p>above the entrance to <i>Quassy Amusement Park</i> on your right. The 
<b>Route 64 parking lot</b> </p>
<p>will be on your left. Its gravel and has a large sign board. <b>Meadowview 
Park</b> is located </p>
<p>South on Route 188, just past the junction with Route 64. Dont take the 
first turn onto</p>
<p>Route 188 off of Route 64, as this is the Northern junction.</p>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>To reach the <b>Route 63 parking lot</b>, turn left off of Route 64 at the 
Route 63 junction. Before you cross under the<b> I</b>84 underpass, you will see 
where the trail begins in front of the <i>Maggie McFlys Restaurant</i> on your 
right. Turn right at Service Road and go behind the restaurant. You will see a 
sign that says "additional parking" up a small hill.</p><b>
</b><p>Eastbound; Take a left off the exit onto Route 63. Proceed underneath the 
underpass to the <b>Route 63 parking lot</b> on your left. See above 
directions.</p></dir></dir></dir></dir>
<p>The<i> Middlebury Greenway</i> follows the rail bed of a former trolley line 
which ran from the city of Waterbury Woodbury. It was built in 1908 by the 
<i>Connecticut Company</i> and closed in 1930. In 1992, the route was turned 
into a multi-use trail and has been improved upon yearly. It is now almost fully 
paved, except for a short  mile section. For the most part, it parallels Route 
64, with extensive landscaping, fencing, granite benches and a babbling brook. 
Most road crossings have crosswalks, but there are some steep inclines along the 
route.</p>
<p>Starting from the <b>Route 63 parking lot, </b>the trail heads Northwest away 
from Route 63 and soon parallels Route 64 in a more or less east-west direction. 
After a mile youll come to a nice brick patio area with benches for a quick 
rest. Another  mile brings you to the <b>Chase Road parking lot</b>. After 
traveling 2  miles you come to a newly completed tunnel underneath Route 188. 
Next to the benches is a stone opening, circa 1907, that I believe to be an old 
trolley stop. Proceed through the tunnel and up an incline. As your descending 
down the other side, look for a grassy area with a granite bench on your left. 
If the trail turns to gravel, youve gone too far. From the bench, take a 
reading of 120 degrees. Sight a large, fern covered boulder on the hillside. A 
dead tree is lying across the top of the boulder. Go to the dead trees base and 
look under a rock for the prize you seek. Continuing along the trail, the 
pavement ends at the 3 mile mark and turns to packed gravel for  a mile. Along 
this stretch, you pass by <b>Meadowview Park</b>, where they are presently 
building a rest room pavilion. You go along the ballfields and the alongside 
Route 64 again. Down to your left is<i> Lake Elise</i>. You descend down, then 
up a hill and as you are going around a curve, look to your right across the 
road to spot another old trolley stop. As you crest this hill, on your left will 
be the gravel, <b>Route 64 parking lot</b>, along with a sign post. You may 
descend down the hill for another 3/10 of a mile to the Quassy Ball Fields, 
where the trail ends. Across the road is the <i>Quassy Amusement Park</i>, 
fronting <i>Lake Quassapaug</i>.</p><b>
