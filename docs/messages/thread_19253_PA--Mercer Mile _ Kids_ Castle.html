                    <div class="plaintext-content">Could anyone tell me the nature of the Mercer Mile and the Kids' Castle Park area in Doylestown, PA? (Bucks County)  I'm aware that there are a few letterboxes there and have the clues printed out.  If you think it will be uninteresting info. for the whole group, please email me at annalisa@fast.net. I've been in Mercer Museum many times, and on the Tile Works grounds, and to the Michener Art Museum, and to the other house that Mercer built (forget the name offhand)  But I need to plan a possible outing for a group of people that is a kinda strange mix for this Thurs.... kids, adults, some who love to walk long distances and some who are unable, a few who may want to just have a nice spot to sit and talk while others look for the letterboxes and others play.  Does this sound like a possible spot for such a thing?  I'm not sure how these areas connect with eachother... in other words, is the Mercer Mile really a mile? Is it a loop or a straight line or neither?  And is Kids' Castle on this "Mile" and/or within easy walking access of Mercer Museum?  I wondered too if the new Booktenders shop is close by.  These are strange questions, and I thank anyone with willingness to share answers!  --lunaryakketyact<br/>
