They may be right. We have no trouble with Earthlink when we are in <br/>
Seal Beach,Ca., but here in Kernville we have a heck of a time with <br/>
connections. I believe it could be the "hick" factor or maybe we <br/>
just have some lousy phone lines.<br/>

I have checked the phone line &amp; modem - exactly as Earthlink told me<br/>
too... And there is no interference on my side. The problem is that I<br/>
can't get logged on. When it connects to verify my password something<br/>
stops responding and I get the unable to connect message. Once I do<br/>
connect, I am lucky if it is at 28kbps. There is major lag time where<br/>
there is nothing rec'd or sent. Now, not all of their numbers are this<br/>
way... If I dial long distance (Colorado Springs) I don't have this<br/>
problem... Only with the majority of my local numbers.<br/>
<br/>
I have had earthlink for a long time. In fact, I used to be a mindspring<br/>

anything on their side could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I hate the thought of having to change my email address... That is such<br/>
a pain.. But I am also really tired of it taking me forever (up to an<br/>
hour sometimes) to connect. Once I do connect I stay on all day because<br/>
I don't want to go through the whole process again.. And that means my<br/>
phone line is tied up all day.<br/>
