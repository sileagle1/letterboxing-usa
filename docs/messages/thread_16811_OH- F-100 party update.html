There are also some traveling event stamps on the way to me &amp; I am now in possession of the Dancing at Bougival HH!! (thanks to Seeker of Flags and Reporter at Large who passed through the area yesterday) which will go home with some lucky attendee to be handed on to another letterboxer. <br/>
<br/>
It's shaping up to be quite a party! So far, I have:<br/>
<br/>
Team Mad Dawg - 1<br/>
Howling Crow - 2 adults, 1 kid<br/>
Bigguy &amp; family - 2 adults, 2 kids<br/>
Franzsolo - 1<br/>
Mama Stork - 1 adult, 1 kid<br/>
CrappieFisherGirl - 1<br/>
Mr Bloodhound - 2<br/>
Cave Cricket - 1<br/>
Me - 1<br/>
<br/>
Total= 12 adults, 4 kids<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else? Please let me know if you will be attending. I'll get to the restaurant about 4:15-4:30 to reserve us a big enough table/area &amp; enough seats. I called them and they don't take advanced phone reservations. :-(<br/>
