I just found out this morning that I will be traveling to Williamsburg<br/>
VA by bus tomorrow (Friday) to attend a fife and drum tattoo/parade.<br/>
I'm staying at the Governor's Inn and won't have a car or much free<br/>
time.  Does anyone know of boxes hidden close to the park that should<br/>
not be missed?  I found a few boxes but won't know the distance from<br/>
my motel til I get there.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help you can provide.  Sorry this is short notice but I<br/>
couldn't pass up the adventure.<br/>

Wait a minute, you can't throw that out there with no explanation. I<br/>

Dearest Azobox, Thank you for the kind flattery however her Ladyship<br/>
is too embarassed to attempt humor now that her Ladyship has looked up<br/>
tattoo in the dictionary. One feels rather stupid. <br/>
<br/>
That said if there ever is a tattoo parade of the sort her Ladyship<br/>
was imagining please promise that you would deign to be her Ladyship's<br/>
escort, it would be quite interesting....<br/>

  If you and Sir Azobox ever do find or organize a tattoo parade of the fleshy kind, please let me know. I will be glad to show off all 10 of mine. Many in places that require the removal of a ladys undergarments....good thing I ain't no lady! Woo-hoo!!!<br/>
