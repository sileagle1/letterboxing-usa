laugh at how different our problems are. Although no less real to each<br/>
of us.<br/>
Where I live now in Washington state it is much better than Utah was<br/>
but still in my town, which is in Eastern Washington, there are only 5<br/>
letterboxes close by and 3 of those are posted by us. If I got upset<br/>
and pulled my boxes from the LBNA site I can't imagine that anyone<br/>
would ever care to hunt them down. I have had a box posted here for<br/>
more than a month and not one person has visited it yet and that was<br/>
in the summer months.<br/>
My two cents,<br/>

&gt; &gt; This latest thread has convinced me to turn off the status of my boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; as displayed on the site.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, this thread has prompted me to reconsider how my boxes are listed <br/>
&gt; also.  I have always had the status disabled because I think it <br/>
&gt; detracts from the intrigue of the box to have a log of who was there <br/>
&gt; (and when) before you.  I am now at the point of seriously considering <br/>
&gt; completely removing all of my boxes from both LbNA and AtlasQuest and <br/>
&gt; just leaving the clues posted on my personal web site.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If this means less people look for them, so it is.  The clues are out <br/>
&gt; there, available to anyone who cares to venture to my web site for <br/>
&gt; them.  As I see it, there are a couple of other positives about this -- <br/>
&gt; I feel like I am encouraging another aspect of the game that many do <br/>
&gt; not understand or appreciate -- the hunt for the clues themselves, and <br/>
&gt; also I suspect that although the boxes may see fewer overall visitors, <br/>
&gt; those who do bother to hunt down the clues will tend to be more serious <br/>
&gt; and seasoned letterboxers, which seems to directly correlate to fewer <br/>
&gt; missing boxes.<br/>
