Hey we went looking for this one today (and on other occasions) but have had <br/>
no luck with finding the first clue either.  We haven't been as shy looking <br/>
through shrubbery either, but still nothing.  I have emailed the placer again, <br/>
we'll see if he is around.  I'll let you know if I hear anything.<br/>
