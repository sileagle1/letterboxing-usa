next Thursday. Though they keep our schedule pretty well packed (8 am<br/>
to 9 pm  chock full of stuff- YUCK!), I might be able to slip out in<br/>
the early mornings to find a box or two. Are there any ones right in<br/>
the area that are quick hikes and relatively easy finds folks would<br/>
recommend? I also am not sure whether I'll be able to get my hands on<br/>
transportation or not. We'll see what I can cook up, but want to know<br/>
if there are boxes in the area I should try going for. E-mail me<br/>
off-list if you want. Thanks!<br/>
