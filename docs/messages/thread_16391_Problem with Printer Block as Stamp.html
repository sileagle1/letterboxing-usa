I've recevied a few mails today asking about the printer block.<br/>
I wish the blocks would work as "regular" stamps, but so far no luck.<br/>
1. inkpad ink is not thick/gooy enough to adhere to the brass design <br/>
the block is made of.<br/>
2. imprint comes out very light and sometimes incomplete.<br/>
3. printing inks dry slowly and smear and.... well i dont think they <br/>
are very feasible for toting around in any weather condition.<br/>
So, I will attempt to make a stamp version and continue to search <br/>
for ways to apply ink in the field.<br/>
There has to be a good quality, fast drying, portable <br/>
printing/inking system out there somewhere. I hope so, as i have a <br/>
few other blocks i'd like to put into service.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to give you hints as to what the block is of, but...do i <br/>
dare???Hint 1. any classic auto buffs out there??<br/>
<br/>
Cruis'n in Ahhs<br/>
