<p>Barrows Pond</p></b>
<p>Placed: 1-5-02</p>
<p>Placed by: C. Straub, and my dog Molly</p>
<p>Location: Mansfield, CT Tolland County</p>
<p>Rated: Easy</p>
<p>Take Rt. 195 in Mansfield Center to Clovermill Road. This will be a left hand 
turn. Follow this road to the gravel parking lot on the right. This is 
Schoolhouse Brook Park.Cross the road to the only trail which is Barrows Trail. 
Go about 20 feet and quickly come to a Y in the path. Take a left and walk 
alongside Barrows Pond’s NE shore. Come to a Y in the trail of Barrows Trail and 
Ski Trail. Here you will see a man made dam taken over, and the level raised by 
active beavers. Bear left and take the ski trail. You will come to cross a very 
small bridge. Keep following the white blazed trees which mark the trail. Follow 
the trail uphill until you come to a four way intersection of paths. The paths 
that converge here are Heritage, Barrows and Ski Trail. Take out your compass 
and go down the trail which is at 300 degrees. The trail goes down hill to the 
waters and dams edge. Go left along the shoreline staying about twenty feet from 
the shore. Quickly you will come to a bit of a clearing where the beavers have 
been very active chewing the trees. Look for a tree with an aluminum square 
nailed to it by 4 nails. The square is about five inches by five inches. From 
this tree go South 57 steps to a tree in which two oaks seem to come from one 
base. In the Y of this tree covered with sticks is the Barrows Pond letterbox. 
Backtrack from here to get to the parking area. </p>
