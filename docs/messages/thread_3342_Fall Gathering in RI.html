                    <div class="plaintext-content">Time is quickly fleeting and Oct 6 will be here before any of us are <br/>
ready for it.  The other date we had considered was Sep 15 and I have <br/>
to admit that with the tragic events of last week I am glad that the <br/>
Oct date was chosen.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those that have volunteered their efforts for activities.  <br/>
We should have lots of boxes in the area to keep busy that day but a <br/>
few quickies in the immediate area would be nice (hint, hint).  Wanda <br/>
and Pete have several in Burlingame, there are some across Rt 1 in <br/>
Ninigret and I have yet to write up the clues for the series I <br/>
planted over a month ago in North Burlingame.  <br/>
<br/>
No one volunteered for the event stamp so I will do that.  I will <br/>
have to actually take my time and try and create one worthy of the <br/>
occasion (mine are usually slap-dash).  We will try and make an <br/>
estimate of those coming as time gets closer to ensure that we have <br/>
enough paper goods for dinner, etc.  Let Shannon or I know what you <br/>
would like to do for dinner (potluck, pizza, ?).  Now is the time to <br/>
speak up.  <br/>

I won't be able to make the outing, but if you want I<br/>
will do the event stamp for you... I am becoming a<br/>
fairly apt carver! Let me know if you would like me to<br/>
do that, as you have enough to do already! And if you<br/>
want me to do it, let me know what you had in mind for<br/>
a design and I can do my own rendition of your<br/>
theme... I figured if the theme of the weekend was<br/>
"wizard of oz" have a stamp with the yellow brick road<br/>
leading up to the castle of the wizard in the<br/>
background..<br/>

I just wanted to wish you all a wonderful time this weekend at the Fall<br/>
Gathering in New England.  I wish I could be there letterboxing with you.<br/>
It would be great to meet such legendary letterboxers!  What a thrill.<br/>
Alas...I have to pack all weekend to get ready to move from my apartment.  <br/>
<br/>
HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME!!!!  I'LL BE THERE IN SPIRIT!<br/>
