<br/>
Thanks so much for the lovely welcome!  This seems like a wonderful<br/>
board and I'm happy to be here!<br/>
<br/>
I wrote that I was planting my letterbox, unfortunately, the same day,<br/>
there was a car accident that killed two of my relatives and their<br/>
friend.    They were all very young, it's been a sad time for us. <br/>
We're ready now though, to get going with our box!   <br/>
<br/>
Ruthann - I'm going to take the LB info to my local support group<br/>
meeting the first week of September.  I know a few there who will just<br/>
*love* this!<br/>
<br/>
Tau - I didn't realize it was in HEM Magazine.  I've been meaning to<br/>
subscribe since we started hsing but just haven't.  Can I subscribe<br/>
online?  Could you send me the link?  <br/>
<br/>
Ellen - Thank you SO much for pointing us in the LB direction over on<br/>
the FIAR board.  This is a perfect fit for us!  We're going to try to<br/>
include a LB adventure with some of the books we do.<br/>
<br/>
Carol - we *just* returned from Louisville on Monday!  We went to the<br/>
World Championship Horse Show at the state fair.  We didn't have time<br/>
to do any of the LB hunts :(  but we definitely want to return there<br/>
soon.  My 13yo is just quivering to go to the new milliion-dollar<br/>
all-cement/steel skateboard park that was erected in Louisville, so<br/>
we'll do some LBing then.  I'll let you know how long of an adventuure<br/>
our LB turns out to be after we plant it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again everyone!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Roxanne<br/>
