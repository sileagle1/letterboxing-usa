As usual,we have added more hikes, but this time we were<br/>
asked to add a hike from one of our readers. When<br/>
we started this Website, we said that it would become<br/>
whatever was needed by the general letterboxing<br/>
community - You ! We have decided that we will post<br/>
graphics and verbage from your letterboxing experience<br/>
for everyone to share.<br/>
<br/>
We ask for the following consideration -<br/>
<br/>
Do not ask us to post anything that would give away<br/>
clues or otherwise compromise any of the fun in a<br/>
given letterboxing hike. We have previously had to<br/>
tailor photographs of our own to accomplish this. The<br/>
idea here is to share and entice more participants <br/>
without diluting any of the experience.<br/>
<br/>
Submissions should be made by Email to<br/>
Bill@LetterboxingCentral.com<br/>
Please allow us a week to process and post your photos.<br/>
