<p align="center">I'm trying the suggestion of coping and pasting my Letterbox to 
the site. I'm also sending an attachment in case it doesn't work. I tend to 
spend a lot of time on my clues and to put them into a form that lets other 
boxers know exactly what to expect. If I were more computer literate, I would 
post them to my own site . I may try that in the future so that all my Hike It 
or Bike It clues are together. Here goes.</p>

<p>With a campus map you can start just about anywhere along the tour route I 
made up.</p><b></b></dir></dir></dir></dir>
<p>Difficulty: Easy. Paved sidewalks throughout the campus.</p><b>
</b><p>Directions: From <b>I</b>84, take exit 68. Head South down Route 195 to 
Storrs, CT and the UCONN </p>
<p>Campus. As you head down the hill into the campus, youll pass by the 
<i>Towers Dorms</i> on</p>
<p>your right, then the yellow <i>Dairy Barn</i> on your left. Normally you 
would take a left after </p>
<p>passing the <i>Agricultural Biotechnology Building</i> also on the left. 
However, at present they </p>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>are adding on to it, so you take the next left and proceed down the road, 
taking another left at the <i>White Building</i>. This brings you to the 
<i>Dairy Bar</i> parking lot. If you wish to shorten your journey to the 
Letterbox, you may park near the <i>Visitors Center</i> or simply pick up a 
campus map from there before you get started. To get to the <i>Visitors 
Center</i>, continue down Route 195 until you come to North Eagleville Road and 
take a right. You will see plenty of campus signs directing you to the 
<i>Visitors Center</i>.</p></dir></dir></dir></dir>
<p>.</p><b>
</b><p>Note: Parking is tight on campus, especially during the semester. 
Weekends are better. There is a </p>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>parking garage near the <i>Visitors Center</i>, but parking at the <i>Dairy 
Bar</i> is free, although there is a time limit during the weekdays. All the 
buildings on campus have blue signs in front of them with there names. The 
campus map is excellent and is also displayed</p></dir></dir></dir></dir>
<p>on blue sign boards throughout the campus. </p><b>
</b><p>Dendrology is the scientific study of trees. As a Forestry and Wildlife 
major at the <i>University of Connecticut</i>, I had to learn how to identify 
trees and shrubs from their leaves, buds, bark and even their smell. This 
allowed me to be able to identify trees in the middle of winter. As the years 
have progressed however, I find myself having a harder time identifying the tree 
species. So, in order to refresh my memory, what better way then to devise a 
Letterbox that identifies trees and shrubs along the route to the Letterbox. If 
you have kids, theyll love to learn the tree names. Ive also devised the clues 
to reach the Letterbox, as a tour of the campus and its buildings.</p><b>
</b><p>Note: The campus has been adding new buildings left and right and will be 
continuing to do so for years to </p>
<p>come, so detours may spring up every now and then. Ill try to update these 
clues as often as possible</p>
<p>when new buildings arise or old ones are torn down. This includes the trees. 
Enjoy the beauty of </p>

</b><p>Starting from the Southeast corner of the <i>White Building</i>, find 
the<b> American Sycamore</b> tree (no tag). Head South between the <i>Young 
Building</i> (<i>College of Agriculture</i>) and the <i>Ratcliffe Hicks 
Building</i>, passing by a <b>Crab Apple </b>tree (tag #2065) on your right. </p></div></body></html>
