                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're back in Virginia having spent a very rainy week in Jamestown, <br/>
Rhode Island.  In spite of the weather, we were able to do some <br/>
hiking and stamping.  We're happy to have added 6 stamps to our <br/>
journal.  Misery Loves Company was our first find, and Katybug's <br/>
first compass reading lesson from a very patient fellow letterboxer <br/>
who'd already found all of the boxes we searched for, but allowed us <br/>
to enjoy the hunt for ourselves.  Our second search was at <br/>
Wickaboxet, where we added the Firetower Ledge stamp, but discovered <br/>
the Rattlesnake Ledge box missing.  The information sheet was found <br/>
on the path, and after a pretty exhaustive search, we weren't able to <br/>
find any other pieces of the box.  We were already clued in to the <br/>
fact that the Fort Wetherill box was missing, but took the walk to <br/>
the spot anyway.  It's a great spot and hopefully a replacement box <br/>
will reside there soon.  The other four stamps we added before coming <br/>
home were the Beavertail Lighthouse, Island Sanctuary, Stepping <br/>
Stone, and Breaking Hearts.  We love Rhode Island for a lot of <br/>
reasons.  The great trails and fun letterboxing is just one more!<br/>
