Bluebird will be with me during the morning of the 30th, since she <br/>

day.  <br/>

Please go to atlasquest and sign up on the events page, or e-mail me <br/>
via AQ mail if you want to get together for breakfast or something on <br/>
the 30th!  I'd love to meet the letterboxers from the area!<br/>

I'm not sure who is listed on AQ from San Diego. I've on recently been posting and reading the messages here. I know a few people who letterbox but they never bother with reading these posts or even recording their finds. I only know two ther letterboxers from San Diego and I'm not sure either one of them is particularly active at this time.<br/>

<br/>
You might want to post something on the SoCal list. Another thing you <br/>
might try would be to go to the Gathering listing at AQ for SD, and <br/>
send out some individual notes. Many of the folks in SD are fairly new, <br/>
have small kids and a lack of time to devote to reading chatlists.<br/>
