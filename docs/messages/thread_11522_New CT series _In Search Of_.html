                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I have posted 3 new letterboxes which start my new series "In Search<br/>
of". The subject matter of this series is the unexplained, myths, legends,<br/>
and the supernatural. The first 3 boxes are "In Search of Nessie" (The Loch<br/>
Ness Monster),  'In Search of Caddy" (The Cadborosaurus sea monster of the<br/>
Pacific Northwest), "In Search of Sasquatch" (Big Foot). The series will not<br/>
be in any particular town. There will be boxes placed in many different<br/>
areas as Molly and I do our hikes.  I don't have any set number of boxes<br/>
planned and expect I will still be posting them well into 2004 if not<br/>
longer. Three boxes have just been posted, others are planted but the clues<br/>
not released. Some have only been carved and there are still some just in<br/>
the planning stage. The following are going to be the some of the subjects<br/>
in this series.<br/>
In Search of Mermaids, In Search of  Sasquatch, In Search of the Nessie, In<br/>
Search of Caddy, In Search of Ogopogo, In Search of The Grays, In Search of<br/>
The Mongolian Death Worm, In Search of Champ, In Search of The Abominable<br/>
Snowman, In Search of The Giant Sloth, In Search of Mokele Mbenbe, In Search<br/>
of The Cottingley Fairies, In Search of Spring Heeled Jack, In Search of The<br/>
Black Dog of Bungay, In Search of a Yowie, In Search of The Australian Drop<br/>
Bear, In Search of a UFO, In Search of The White Horse of Uffington, In<br/>
Search of The Tasmanian Tiger, In Search of The Big Cats of England, In<br/>
Search of The Mothman, In Search of The Chupacabra, In Search of The Jersey<br/>
Devil, In Search of The Gloucester Sea Serpent, In Search of The Bunyip of<br/>
the Billabong.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy them as much as I am enjoying making them......Chuck and<br/>

We cannot wait to see if the Sasquatch will reveal himself to the <br/>
kids today!  Maybe I'd better hang back so I don't spook him :o)<br/>

  What a great Idea!  I had been thinking of something similar but ya <br/>
beat me to the punch.  These are great, and I can't wait to get out <br/>
and do them.  And you hit my two favorite to start off with. I hadn't <br/>
heard of Caddy befor but sounds neat.  <br/>
  Have you heard about the rumored Dinosaur in the Congo?  I can't <br/>
remember the name of the animal however it got a lot of press in the <br/>
late 80's.  It's rumored that a large suarapod type dino is there.<br/>
