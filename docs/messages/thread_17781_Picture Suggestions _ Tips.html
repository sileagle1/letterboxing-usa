few ideas:<br/>
<br/>
* Crop your photos a little bit. Include the pertinent "image" you'd <br/>
care to share with the world, but try to keep the image a bit smaller.<br/>
<br/>
* When taking pictures, consider using a resolution that is a bit <br/>
more coarse and less compression of the image. Digital cameras have <br/>
excellent user-applied settings. If the image takes up a lot of your <br/>
memory card, it will certainly take up a lot of the database.<br/>
<br/>
* Weed out some of the pictures that are "older".  Perhaps the <br/>
moderators can thin out the herd and take out some of the images that <br/>
are say.... 6 months old? <br/>
<br/>
*  Geocities allows for free web hosting and has a very easy and very <br/>
basic program called pagebuilder. We use it for our homepage. Try it <br/>
out!  Drop a link to your page in the "links" section. If you put <br/>
something really cool on there....or pictures from a certain <br/>
event....then post it to the list and we'll check it out!<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to post other tips...that's what this list is <br/>
about... helping each other and perhaps showing others a "better" way <br/>
of doing things. No, we're not trying to reinvent the wheel....just <br/>
keeping it round so life rolls better!<br/>
