afternoon (around 1:30), and must have missed See Joy<br/>

I'll head for the 3rd box later this week - we had a<br/>
young borzoi training with us and didn't want her out<br/>
for too long, so we didn't finish today :(<br/>

<br/>
My new friend Lydia and I were out and found all three boxes on the 13th<br/>
too.  We accidentally wrote the 11th.  We were out there from 11:00 to<br/>
12:00.  Sorry we missed you all.<br/>
