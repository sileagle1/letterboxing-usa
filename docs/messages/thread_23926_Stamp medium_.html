Welcome to this fun hobby!  I don't know that you will find the exact <br/>
size that you want, but Hobby Lobby carries Speedy Stamp (pink stuff) <br/>
in a 3x4 (I think) sheet.  It is easy to cut into whatever size you <br/>
need.<br/>
<br/>
Since you are new, have you joined the newboxers group?  <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/   People there are very <br/>
receptive to all questions.<br/>
<br/>
I live in NW Indiana and hope to see you at a gathering sometime in the <br/>
future. <br/>

&gt; The Hobby Lobby in Bridgeview/Burbank area and in Orland, carry the<br/>
&gt; pink speedball medium in a 4 x 6 sheet and then a beige color, a<br/>
&gt; little thicker medium, in a 8 x 10 sheet, and they also have small 3<br/>
&gt; x 5 white medium as well.  <br/>

&gt;           Hi there!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Welcome to this fun hobby! I don't know that you will find the exact <br/>
&gt; size that you want, but Hobby Lobby carries Speedy Stamp (pink stuff)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; in a 3x4 (I think) sheet. It is easy to cut into whatever size you <br/>
&gt; need.<br/>
