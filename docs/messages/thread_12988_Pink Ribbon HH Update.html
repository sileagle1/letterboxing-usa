As requested by TeamGreenDragon, we're updating folks<br/>
about the Pink Ribbon HH.<br/>
<br/>
Two letterboxers found it on 4/14/03 at Turkey Trot,<br/>
but they did not leave their names in the book, only<br/>
their stamps. They also did not write down or stamp in<br/>
where they left it.<br/>
<br/>
Pink Ribbon was then found and dropped off somewhere<br/>
on 4/23/03 by Susan A. from Leominster. She also did<br/>
not say where she found it, so it's location between<br/>
Turkey Trot and Pig Pen is unknown.<br/>
<br/>
On 4/25/03, Trickster, Thunderbird, E-man, and The<br/>
Dawn left it at Pig Pen Ledges. They also did not<br/>
write down where they found it.<br/>
<br/>
On 5/17/03, Fuzzy's Friend found it at Pig Pen Ledges,<br/>
and moved it to the Northampton Bike Path. True to the<br/>
spirit of the HH, Fuzzy told us where he put it, so it<br/>
could continue it's travels.<br/>
<br/>
TehutiKa, AsetKa and the kids picked it up on 5/20/03,<br/>
and we will let everyone know where we bring it next<br/>
once we do.<br/>
<br/>
So, since it's last update, 12 people have found this<br/>
HH, and it's been to at least 3 boxes. <br/>
<br/>

True to the wishes of TeamGreenDragon, we reveal the<br/>
new resting place of the Pink Ribbon HH to be The Tree<br/>
Box at Holcomb Farm in West Granby CT, on 6/3/03! We<br/>
got it at Northampton Bike Path on 5/20/03. <br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting everyone.....<br/>
