little boxing:<br/>
<br/>
Trolley Car: there's a no-tresspassing sign part way down the trail to the<br/>
first box so we were very good and turned around. Second box was noted as<br/>
missing, so we headed back and watched the osprey babies for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Shoreline Stamp: sign on door saying "Retiring" and the shop is only open in<br/>
July for stock-taking.<br/>
<br/>
Golden Thread: heavily waterlogged - logbook is trashed and covered in rust.<br/>
Couldn't read contact details. Box was not hidden either and we couldn't<br/>
find where it should have been. Stamp is still fine though. Listed as<br/>
abandoned on website.<br/>
<br/>
Beacon Hill #1 - interesting walk though trail is overgrown and a bit<br/>
treacherous in places (I wouldn't do it with kids). Found Rememberance HH<br/>
too! We bailed on #2 because we were getting too hot and tired!<br/>
<br/>
A Letterboxers Paradise - box was A-OK - great store so we stocked up on<br/>
letterboxing essentials<br/>
<br/>
Buteo Jamaicensis - saw the nest and heard the hawks but didn't see them.<br/>
<br/>
Jonathan's Birthday - A-OK<br/>
<br/>
Norwalk Historical Society - neat stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Disc Golf - couldn't find either box but played all 18 holes (first game in<br/>
over 6 years) and we both even made par on a couple. Lovely course. Still<br/>
recovering! Forgotten how much I love frisbee sports :-)<br/>
<br/>
Also did some mystery boxes, some more successfully than others :-)<br/>
<br/>
All in all - a great weekend!<br/>
