                    <div class="plaintext-content">Most of you probably remember my recent postings about concerns <br/>
regarding some happenings at the letterboxing.org site. I have no <br/>
desire to bring up any of it again, except to say that I agree with <br/>
Randy Hall that the situation is intractable. Instead, I have decided <br/>
to instead offer an additional resource to letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
After encouragement from  several people, I have decided to resurrect <br/>
the letterboxing.com site that I have owned for a very long time. <br/>
Some might remember that earlier this year I was working on making it <br/>
a database/catalog site for letterboxes with input from several <br/>
people on this list. I halted the project in March due to a variety <br/>
of issues including liability concerns. Despite my continuing <br/>
concerns in that area, I decided that I feel it is important to offer <br/>
the community an additional resource for letterboxing. The site is <br/>
intended to be complementary to the letterboxing.org site (not in <br/>
competition or conflict) and, as before, I offer to cooperate with <br/>
them in any way possible.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the brief info. I am intending for the site to be 100% open <br/>
community resource for letterboxers. What does that mean? Everyone <br/>
who is interested in contributing ideas to the development is invited <br/>
to participate. All discussion and debate is _public_ and open to <br/>
view of everyone who chooses to participate. Almost all site <br/>
development decisions will be made based upon a vote of those who <br/>
want to participate. There are only two exceptions I wish to <br/>
maintain. One is the right to veto ideas which I believe would have <br/>
adverse legal implications for me as the owner of the domain name. <br/>
The second is simply that I expect everyone to respect the right of <br/>
others to disagree without engaging in personal attacks.<br/>
<br/>
As I see it now the primary purpose of the site will be to provide <br/>
letterboxing news, stories, and clues that can be _easily_ added by <br/>
the participants themselves. Anyone will be able to submit news <br/>
stories and clues at their leisure. Whether or not any additional <br/>
aspects will be added (e.g. letterboxing merchandise such as patches, <br/>
hats etc..) will be up to the vote of participants. The news and <br/>
stories portion of the site is currently functional. The clues <br/>
database/catalog is in development and I am seeking input about <br/>
features.<br/>
<br/>
All you need to participate is a desire and your ideas, _no_ <br/>
technical knowledge needed! However, if anyone out there is a <br/>
computer geek (like myself) with knowledge of html/php/mysql <br/>
programming, your assistance would certainly be appreciated as well.<br/>
<br/>
_Everyone_ who is interested in participating or asking questions <br/>
about the project is invited to join the mailing list. You can <br/>
subscribe or unsubscribe at any time. Please don't burden this main <br/>
list with extensive discussion. To subscribe to the new list for <br/>

development of this new letterboxing resource!<br/>

<br/>
Utter nonsense. What is lacking on letterboxing.org other than you not being<br/>
in control?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Here is the brief info. I am intending for the site to be 100% open<br/>
&gt; community resource for letterboxers. What does that mean? Everyone<br/>
&gt; who is interested in contributing ideas to the development is invited<br/>

&gt; view of everyone who chooses to participate.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds wonderful. Let's have weeks of debate concerning what color the<br/>
background of the clue page. Let's discuss the merits of a solid fill North<br/>
America outline over that of a striped outlined  North Amerca outline.<br/>
Nonsense<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Almost all site<br/>

Get a lawyer and quit playing this liability game.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The second is simply that I expect everyone to respect the right of<br/>

<br/>
Who will decide? You?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; As I see it now the primary purpose of the site will be to provide<br/>
&gt; letterboxing news, stories, and clues that can be _easily_ added by<br/>
&gt; the participants themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Just like letterboxing.org and this list does now. What are you giving to<br/>
letterboxing other that a second source of the same information? Now I get<br/>
to go to two pages to make sure I have all clues. Nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Anyone will be able to submit news<br/>
&gt; stories and clues at their leisure.<br/>
<br/>
As it is on this list and the letterboxing.org site. What are you<br/>
offeringthat is NEW or IMPROVED other than you being in control?<br/>

&gt; aspects will be added (e.g. letterboxing merchandise such as patches,<br/>

&gt; database/catalog is in development and I am seeking input about<br/>
&gt; features.<br/>
<br/>
Don't do it. What is broken in the letterboxing.org site that makes you feel<br/>
you need to do the clues on your site?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; All you need to participate is a desire and your ideas, _no_<br/>

<br/>
Bullsh*t. Thisis the MAIN list and you have yet given a reason why we need a<br/>
duplicate site. All because "encouragement from  several people"? Well in<br/>
the spirit of openness who are these several people that feel we need<br/>
another site to post clues and who are these "several people" that feel we<br/>
need a second mail-list? Where are you going to post these communications of<br/>
"encouragement from  several people" so we all can see them? After all we<br/>
don't want any secret communications, right?<br/>

&gt; That is a worthwhile contribution, even if that's all that<br/>
letterboxing.com<br/>
&gt; provides. Choice spurs innovation. Innovation is good.<br/>
<br/>
It isn't innovation. It is a person that for some reason has an axe to<br/>
grind. Look at Eric's tagline.<br/>
" Letterboxing International: http://www.letterboxing.com The 100% Open<br/>
Letterboxing Community"<br/>
No axe? A very immature jab at whom he says he isn't in competition or<br/>
conflict with. SOUR GRAPES ERIC!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Eric says "As I see it now the primary purpose of the site will be to<br/>
provide<br/>
letterboxing news, stories, and clues that can be _easily_ added by<br/>
the participants themselves. "<br/>
<br/>
How is that innovation? What does this ADD to letterboxing in NA that we<br/>
don't already have? It let's Eric feel he has control and newcomers can find<br/>
it more and more confusing as to where to go for clues and what information<br/>
is what. I don't see how this is a positive to the hobby. HOBBY!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have planted 3 boxes in Tacoma and have planned at least 6 more in the<br/>
near future. Until Eric is 100% open with the communications that encouraged<br/>
him to open a duplicate letterboxing site, until Eric can explain how his<br/>
site is innovative and not in competition or conflict with letterboxing.org<br/>
I DO NOT want any of my clues on his site. I hope others will follow and ask<br/>
Eric not to post their clues either. We don't need to fix what isn't broke<br/>
and having two sites for clues is not a very well thought out!<br/>

If the .COM site shows to be an innovative site, people will go to it as<br/>
needed. It could be very useful as an international LB or News site, which<br/>
I would suggest Eric to look into. But I personally discourage the<br/>
cataloging of the same information in two places, (Talk about<br/>

Choice. Choice spurs innovation. Innovation is good.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;It let's Eric feel he has control<br/>
<br/>
If you think "control" is a bad thing, why advocate the status quo where <br/>
monopoly control is vested in one Web site? And if "control" is a good <br/>
thing, why deny some of it to someone else?<br/>
<br/>
Consumers do very well with choice in automobiles, television shows, <br/>
toothpaste, hobbies and sports. Letterboxers will do all right with choice <br/>
in Web sites, too.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;What does this ADD to letterboxing in NA that we don't already have?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Choice. Choice spurs innovation. Innovation is good.<br/>
<br/>
What CHOICE? A site that merely duplicates and dilutes doesn't cause<br/>
innovation.  Eric hasn't stated ONE new idea only what he will duplicate.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;It let's Eric feel he has control<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you think "control" is a bad thing, why advocate the status quo where<br/>
&gt; monopoly control is vested in one Web site? And if "control" is a good<br/>
&gt; thing, why deny some of it to someone else?<br/>
<br/>
"monopoly control"? What does that mean? All I see is a site with clues and<br/>
some other tips. What is the monopoly controlling? You folks talk your stuff<br/>
but never seem to back it up with real life examples.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Consumers do very well with choice in automobiles, television shows,<br/>
&gt; toothpaste, hobbies and sports. Letterboxers will do all right with choice<br/>
&gt; in Web sites, too.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't over choices and you know it. Read the last few posts from Eric<br/>
and supporters and tell me its choices. It is sour grapes and you know it. A<br/>
few of you seem mad because you didn't get your way.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I don't want my clues on the 100% OPEN axe to grind letterbox<br/>
site. I sure hope others see the light too. No reason for the duplicity and<br/>
no reason to support a page that can only claim possible innovation and<br/>
choices but no examples of what they mean. Grind away!<br/>
<br/>
I will voice my opinion on this as long as you boys want to use this list to<br/>
promote Erics page. I am still waiting for Eric to post the communications<br/>
leading to the reopening of his page. Seems MR. Eric 100% OPEN doesn't want<br/>
to be open with this?<br/>

&gt; Glenn, if you aren't interested in another Web site, that's fine. Don't<br/>

<br/>
Yes I can do so and so can others but it isn't that simple and you know it.<br/>
If you don't care to hear my opinion then quite with your BS about this new<br/>
website. It's that simple.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Anything more is your own ax grinding.<br/>
<br/>
I have no axe to grind but your cheap shot replies without quoting anything<br/>
I say is quite telling. I didn't advertise on this list that I was opening a<br/>
new and different website that doesn't conflict or compete it just<br/>
duplicates what is already present, which I don't like 'cause they wouldn't<br/>
do what I wanted. That was Eric, try and keep it straight please.<br/>
<br/>
You don't want to debate the issue you just want to make generic comments<br/>
and act like this new website is just so good for all. It isn't in my<br/>
opinion and I will state my opinion as long as you, Eric and the rest play<br/>
pretend with your phony 100% open letterboxing sight. It is a fraud from<br/>
Eric very first post in this thread.<br/>
<br/>
Spare me your simple clichs and just answer a few of my questions you so<br/>
quickly ignored or don't answer at all.<br/>

Glenn, no clues will be included on the site without the permission <br/>
of the clue owners. As Randy has suggested, any hostile comments you <br/>
have are welcome to come to me directly, but I won't discuss it on <br/>
the list except to clear up a misconceptions such as you had that I <br/>
would include your clues without permission. I will post information <br/>
periodically about the project just as I would expect (and <br/>
appreciate) anyone else to do regarding other letterboxing projects. <br/>
Obviously you have hostility towards me but I still wish you the best.<br/>

I would like to encourage you to develop your site for whatever reasons you <br/>
choose and despite the less than civil response you may have received from <br/>
some on this list. I will submit my clues to your page when you get that <br/>
functionality.<br/>
I also fail to understand why there is such obvious hostility displayed <br/>
towards the idea of there being more than one letterboxing resource <br/>
available. I've enjoyed the convenience of having the LbNA site be the main <br/>
resource for clues and this list being the only one focused on 'boxing, but <br/>
do not think that there is any sort of divine mandate for a single site or <br/>
list. I am perfectly capable of looking around at multiple sites and don't <br/>
expect that anyone owes me the convenience of one stop shopping for <br/>
information or news. I should hope that most people would realize that <br/>
buying a Dr Pepper does not mean I am an enemy of Pepsi or Coke.<br/>
Best wishes for your endeavor!<br/>

Thanks much for the words of encouragement! As for me, I like Dr. <br/>
Pepper, Pepsi, and Coke at different times. Maybe I'm just a sucker <br/>
for sodas ;-)<br/>
<br/>
On a unrelated note, I hope to plant a couple new Florida boxes this <br/>
weekend on one of the most beautiful spring fed rivers I have seen. <br/>
They likely only be accessible by kayak or canoe.  They will be combo <br/>
letterboxes and geoboxes, as I have recently bought an new gps toy :-)<br/>
