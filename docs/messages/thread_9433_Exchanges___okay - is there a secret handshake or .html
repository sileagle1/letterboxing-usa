<br/>
If I see someone on the trail - how, exactly, so we know if they are a fellow <br/>
boxer?  Given the desire to keep covert when stamping, how do we know?<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to exchange, but I don't know the secret handshake...  Short of adding<br/>
"I am letterboxing" to my blaze orange hat - what's a new boxer to do?<br/>
<br/>
Or...is the point to spread the word about letterboxing while chatting on trail -<br/>
but away from finds?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Letterboxers are pretty obvious.  Who else is walking in the park <br/>
reading directions off a piece of paper and looking around?  <br/>
<br/>
Here is some simple ettiquette:<br/>
<br/>
"Excuse me are you letterboxers?"  <br/>
<br/>
No -- "Sorry.  My mistake."  This may or may not lead to other <br/>
conversation.  If they don't seem like letterboxing types there is <br/>
no need to explain the hobby in depth and 'give anything away'.<br/>
<br/>
Yes -- "So am I.  Would you care to exchange stamps?"<br/>
<br/>
Just knowing what to say ahead of time can make all the difference.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly it's just a matter of having the nerve to talk to strangers.  <br/>
When we saw the Apple Dumpling Gang coming down the trail to our <br/>
first box (which happens to be near our house) we so much didn't <br/>
know what to do we ran and hid.  "Don't let them see us."  At the <br/>
time we didn't know about exchanges yet.  Is that shy and silly or <br/>
what?  My daughter spoke to them though.<br/>
<br/>
You can make yourself really obvious by pulling out your directions, <br/>
log and compass and looking around lost.  :-)<br/>
