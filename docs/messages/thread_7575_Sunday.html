I just wanted to tell you that Odilio, Irishtinker, French fox, Rosiebunny,<br/>
and Ladybug98 are declaring Sunday RTRW day. We are hunting the 5 at your<br/>
new plant and Elizabeth Park. We are also going to send FF over to<br/>
Jonathan's Dream since he hasn't gone there yet.<br/>
<br/>
We also might hit the Phoenix tree. Is that still there? I have read<br/>
conflicting reports.<br/>

<br/>
I don't know what your time frame on Sunday is like, but the Rocky Hill<br/>
based "Walk through geologic time" and Cherieph and my "native flower"<br/>
are at dinosaur state park.  I would guess it's probably a 10 minute<br/>
drive down 91 from Cedar Hill.  Native flower is a real quickie and the<br/>
trilobite box is at the farthest corner of the park.  Bring bug spray,<br/>
too.   I was told/read somewhere that the other geologic box is gone.  A<br/>
heads up, Native flower is not hand carved, but trilobite is gorgeous<br/>
and is hand carved.  Very cool stamp, I thought.<br/>
<br/>
Cherieph is looking forward to meeting you at the gathering.  It's funny<br/>
how we feel like we know each other from our boxes and the talk list.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have a great day.<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Hello Rebecca &amp; All -
</p><p>Rumors are correct about the "Walk Through Geologic Time" boxes.  Plan to perform maintenance on these boxes this weekend if I can get out of a Sales Meeting for work.  Trilobite will receive a new log book (reported full) and larger ink pad (thanks for the carving comment). Eubrontes has been recarved and will be replaced and probably relocated.  An add-on box is also planned - stay tuned!
