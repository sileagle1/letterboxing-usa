Great work on the database site!<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if it's been thought of or discussed, but it occurred to <br/>
me that if the site can now track who's logged in, and which boxes <br/>
belong to them, it could also track which boxes they've found.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine it wouldn't be too difficult to add a checkbox next to <br/>
every listed box, and add buttons at the bottom of the page that <br/>
say "Show all unfound boxes," "Show all found boxes," and "Show all <br/>
boxes."  The user checks off those boxes they've found, clicks "Show <br/>
all unfound boxes," and viola! they're presented with a list of boxes <br/>
they have yet to find.  It would make it easy to take note of new <br/>
boxes, rather than having to search through the list trying to <br/>
remember which ones they've already found.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought!<br/>
