<br/>
Sorry for the delay getting my monster boxes to you.  The stamps have actually been carved for a while now.  Took some time to gather the other "ingredients" - boxes, ink, etc.  Trying to get to the post office taody with them.  What else should I send you? Return address for return of boxes? Return postage?  Anything for the gathering?  Let me know.<br/>
