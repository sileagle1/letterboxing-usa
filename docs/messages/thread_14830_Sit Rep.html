A SitRep is a military non-word meaning "Situation Report".  Since I spent 10 years in the military it came across as a natural way for me to share my exploits with the list.  SitRep is the same as [STATE] Box Report, or whatever subject the person cares to use in my NOT so humble opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm not to sure if that's even wanted any more as it appears that some care to not read the status of other boxes.  Or they feel that the reports are cluttering the list.  When I came to this list, that was one of the first things I read and I wanted to share my enthusiasm. <br/>
<br/>
I shall endeavor to curb that in the future and not clutter the lists with such a frivolous waste of bandwidth.<br/>

<br/>
Actually, the whole anti-sitrep thing was a joke for me and don't be so <br/>
serious everyone!  For some reason I can't ever remember the definition, no matter <br/>
how many times I get it.  Anyone can say whatever they want, as long as they <br/>
put the state in the re line so we can delete if we don't have time to read <br/>
them.  I like people's stories about boxing and I like to read them all when I <br/>
have time, but alas that it is not often.  So, no offense meant to anyone from <br/>
this quarter.<br/>

I for one hope that you and everyone else that cares<br/>
to do so will continue to post their boxing<br/>
adventures. Before I became a mod, the only posts I<br/>
used to read were for new boxes in my area, and<br/>
reports from folks that had been out boxing, no matter<br/>
where they lived. For me, those boxing reports,<br/>
regardless of the subject line or title, is still my<br/>
greatest single pleasure in reading this list. I hear<br/>
what the folks I've met on trail, or through email,<br/>
are up to, and learn about boxes that are in far-flung<br/>
places that I may never get to. I certainly don't<br/>
intend to stop posting our letterboxing adventures to<br/>
the list. Where else can I go to gush about the latest<br/>
great stamp, or complain about spider bites in the<br/>
line of duty? :-)<br/>

Well, who's to say what clutters up the list and what doesn't?  I for<br/>
one enjoy reading your sitreps Team Rayvenhaus and hope you continue<br/>
to post them.  In fact I enjoy reading just about all of the reports<br/>
posted on the list and I fail to see why anyone would suggest that<br/>
only certain posts could be made. And I am really sorry that there are<br/>
posts that have turned ugly to the point of hurting feelings over a<br/>
subject so trivial as which words to use in a header. <br/>

I say potato you say pahtato,<br/>

Very few did not post in good-natured jest and ribbing.  That thread was a lot of fun if not read through grumpy eyes.<br/>
<br/>
And that thread is nothing like a "good" newsnet flame war. Yikes!  Those things will have people really running for cover!<br/>
<br/>
:::shudder:::<br/>
<br/>
Most of the people here are great.  We can agree to disagree and not too many get their panties in a bunch until someone starts bellyaching for the sake of bellyaching.  Now, can someone please tell me who are these posters who left because of the posts?  Ah, no, fuggedabouddit.  I can't believe that anyone worth his or her salt ever left because they didn't like what some others were posting about.  I don't miss them, if they ever did exist. Can't say I know who these people are, never mind miss them.<br/>
<br/>
I'm with you, bigguy, when you say if you don't want to read it, don't read it!  We have delete keys, and filters, and good ol' common sense.  I try to use these things as needed.  :-)  No one here is forced to read a thing.  <br/>
<br/>
And I want to add that, yes, as suggested by others, the state posted *first* on the subject line really does make sense.  It sure makes skipping the unwanted stuff much easier. JMHO<br/>

As a newcomer to this list, it seems to me that the ones going on and <br/>
on about something they don't like are the elder members. Maybe I'm <br/>
wrong?? But I agree with someone who stated that this is a semi-<br/>
closed list. Maybe it would be a good idea to start a new list for <br/>
people who are interested in hearing about letterboxes in their area <br/>
and letting the elders have at it. Purple Iris.<br/>

&gt; I have to concur with SpringChick and recent posts by Funhog and <br/>
&gt; TrishKri. Sadly, this list has become a place that has evolved far <br/>
&gt; from its original intent. Even in Digest mode, the amount of chaff <br/>
&gt; and vehemence is overwhelming and has taken on a life of its own. <br/>
It <br/>
&gt; is becoming more and more frustrating to find useful information to <br/>
&gt; respond to. The list is mostly consumed by the same people posting <br/>
&gt; over and over discussing matters that minimally require one or two <br/>
&gt; responses or initiating discussions that belong off list. I found <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; instance where one person posted 44 times in a three week period. <br/>
No <br/>
&gt; wonder so many have fled. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Moderators might urge newcomers to the list to read the FAQs. If <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; did this, a great deal of redundancy might be eliminated. I realize <br/>
&gt; that moderators have their own lives and are not charged with <br/>
&gt; monitoring the list 24/7/365, but with several new moderators, <br/>
&gt; perhaps it might be possible to attempt to actually moderate the <br/>
&gt; direction the list is going while maintaining moderator neutrality. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As co-moderator of another Yahoo list, I am notified when new <br/>
members <br/>
&gt; join. I also discovered that Yahoo provides a way to auto-send or <br/>
&gt; auto-post information periodically. A message sent automatically to <br/>
&gt; new members or a weekly message posted to the list suggesting that <br/>
&gt; those new to the list take some time to read the FAQs and do some <br/>
&gt; research BEFORE asking questions might be a good idea. Trying it <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; a few months could demonstrate whether this works or not. The FAQs <br/>
&gt; for letterboxing are very good and cover most everything that <br/>
&gt; concerns the activity, including references to its history and the <br/>
&gt; way the the game is intended to be played, not to mention some <br/>
&gt; discussion of and links to sites where the interested can learn <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; the artistic side. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At the risk of being inundated both on and off-list by those in <br/>
&gt; disagreement...or agreement... I see the bottom line in this way. <br/>
The <br/>
&gt; letterboxing talk-list has lost some of its most colorful and <br/>
&gt; creative souls. Some have expressed their reasons and their <br/>
&gt; frustrations before going; others have just disappeared, perhaps <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; reasons that have nothing to do with this list or letterboxing. <br/>
Still <br/>
&gt; others will join the disenchanted and continue to leave. Maybe we <br/>
&gt; should not care, but herein lies a message. Perhaps, as in all of <br/>
&gt; life, "the only thing constant is change." People naturally enter <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; leave groups such as this, but when essence, the reason for being, <br/>
&gt; the game becomes so diluted as to be unrecognizable, then all we <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; left with are "instructions" that point us to little plastic boxes <br/>
&gt; and then recountings ad nauseam of having followed <br/>
&gt; the "instructions"...all of this in between one uproar after <br/>
&gt; another.Is this what we really want this list to be like?  Think <br/>
&gt; about it. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Yeh, how about all 1200 of us post about every letterbox we find <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; every time we go out letterboxing because somebody out there <br/>
might <br/>
&gt; &gt; want to read about it and live vicariously through us.  I'm sure <br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone's ISP will be terribly appreciative of the huge volume <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; e-<br/>
&gt; &gt; mails coming through.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I finally understand why most of the people whose posts I enjoyed <br/>
&gt; &gt; reading back when I first started reading this list -- posts that <br/>
&gt; &gt; were actually about things other than a laundry list of boxes <br/>
&gt; found, <br/>
&gt; &gt; are no longer around this list.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; A hobby that enticed me because of its shroud of mystery has been <br/>
&gt; &gt; stripped of a good part of that alure.  Mystery boxes that were <br/>
&gt; hush-<br/>
&gt; &gt; hush subjects are discussed openly on list.  Posts that at one <br/>
time <br/>
&gt; &gt; contained hidden snippets of clues have been replaced by routine <br/>
&gt; &gt; sitreps, to the point that the truly interesting adventures, <br/>
&gt; accounts <br/>
&gt; &gt; of breathtaking views and hikes and praise of wonderfully crafted <br/>
&gt; &gt; stamps and cunningly ingenious clues, end up buried knee-deep in <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt; pile...  Useful and friendly discussion on ancillary topics <br/>
&gt; pertinent <br/>
&gt; &gt; to letterboxing more often than not end up as flame wars and a <br/>
&gt; battle <br/>
&gt; &gt; of "educated" opinions.  Jest and lighthearted banter can no <br/>
longer <br/>
&gt; &gt; fly casually back and forth without a handful taking things out <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; context and spouting off in a defensive huff...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Not to mention I am about nauseous with repeated mentions <br/>
of "being <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; moderator" and "as a moderator"...  who cares? and what is the <br/>
&gt; point?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am disappointed, truly disappointed, but finally I understand <br/>
&gt; where <br/>
&gt; &gt; (or more accurately -- why), they have gone.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used to read were for new boxes in my area, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reports from folks that had been out boxing, no matter<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where they lived. For me, those boxing reports,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regardless of the subject line or title, is still my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; greatest single pleasure in reading this list. I hear<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what the folks I've met on trail, or through email,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are up to, and learn about boxes that are in far-flung<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; places that I may never get to. I certainly don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intend to stop posting our letterboxing adventures to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the list. Where else can I go to gush about the latest<br/>
