                    <div class="plaintext-content">The state of letterboxing today saddens me. Having had the pleasure <br/>
of recently visiting several out of the way letterboxes I noticed <br/>
that letterboxes which require more than a mile or two of hiking get <br/>
very few visitors. Now this wasn't a surprise to me but what I did <br/>
notice is that the older boxes used to get visitors but no longer <br/>
do. The obvious reason is that once upon a time there were very few <br/>
boxes and letterboxers tended to seek out all the boxes available. <br/>
Nowadays, there are so many drive-by boxes few letterboxers seem to <br/>
bother looking for anything else. I find this distressing. <br/>
<br/>
Hiking is an integral part of the letterboxing tradition. The <br/>
original letterbox at Dartmoor required a significant walk to <br/>
obtain. Even today while pub boxes are all over Dartmoor, the real <br/>
letterboxing remains out on the moors (pub boxes do not count <br/>
towards the Dartmoor 100 club). When letterboxing started in the <br/>
United States, boxes were placed in special places, usually <br/>
requiring at least a short stroll. Even with the advent of drive-by <br/>
boxes, they still were placed in special places where you would - by <br/>
choice - linger for a good while to enjoy the scenery or learn some <br/>
history. I remember one of the first drive-by boxes I ever found. It <br/>
was a box hidden near a lighthouse. The clue was clever, the stamp <br/>
wonderful, and the location incredible. Not only was there a <br/>
lighthouse to visit, but there was also a short walk down to a rocky <br/>
beach where we stayed for a good hour enjoying the tide pools, <br/>
spotting seals in the water, and watching birds on the offshore <br/>
rocks. Today it seems that boxers quickly simply stamp in at one non-<br/>
descript playground and drive on to the next for another box. I hope <br/>
that at least they are enjoying the stamp images and not just <br/>
looking to raise their F counts.<br/>
<br/>
The proliferation of postal letterboxing also distresses me. There <br/>
is nothing wrong with the exchange of art by mail. Indeed, the <br/>
first, to my knowledge, postal letterbox was Flutterby. But with <br/>
Flutterby, it came to you by surprise: it wasn't something you <br/>
competed to sign up for before the list closed. You were grateful to <br/>
receive it, and you didn't consider it a letterbox find. Postal <br/>
letterboxing is not letterboxing, it is simply an exchange of art by <br/>
mail. By all means participate if you like, but please don't confuse <br/>
it with letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
I wish dearly that everyone would take a few minutes to think about <br/>
what letterboxing is. The stamp exchange is integral of course, as <br/>
is the clue. However, what many people are missing is that the <br/>
location of and the journey to the box are also integral. In our <br/>
eagerness to share our stamps by planting boxes, we've come to the <br/>
point where we've forgotten about the location and journey. In our <br/>
eagerness to collect as many stamps as possible, we've come to go <br/>
after the easiest boxes to find and thereby missing the beauty of <br/>
the locations of and journeys to the more time consuming boxes.<br/>

I cannot believe how many there are and how over-saturated CT is with boxes. Mansfield is of deep concern to me. I also Geocache and have recently mapped every geocache in CT. If you take away the map features, all of the boxes make the shape of CT on the software program. Again, distressing at how oversaturated it is. What are we to do? Should we go pick up our litter? Back then it wasn't considered litter but it seems that over density is making many boxes and caches a meaningless venture. Meaningless to me and to others could spell litter. I think regulation is in order.<br/>

<br/>
What I'm "hearing" from this post is that you are saddened that not everyone<br/>
likes letterboxing for the same reasons you do.<br/>
<br/>
There are still plenty of boxes being placed in great places, and there are<br/>
plenty of boxes that require a hike or take you to a special spot. If this<br/>
is what you want, then you have it. I don't see a shortage of these.<br/>
<br/>
If you are short on time, or can't afford the gas to get far away to some<br/>
scenic area, or it's too hot (or too cold or too wet or too icy), or you are<br/>
physically not up to a hike because of health issues or small children in<br/>
tow, there are drive-bys, urban boxes, and postal boxes.<br/>
<br/>
If you like the challenge of mysteries or you like straightforward<br/>
directions, you can have it, and you can create more for others to seek.<br/>
<br/>
One of the beauties of boxing is that it has different aspects that appeal<br/>
to different people.  If this distresses you, I can't understand that, but<br/>
would urge you to plant and seek more of the boxes you prefer, and let<br/>
others enjoy what they like. If you want more boxes for longer hikes or<br/>
whatever you feel is good and right about boxing, then create them and seek<br/>
them.  Letterboxing is constantly evolving.  To think that your style of<br/>
letterboxing is somehow superior or more pure than what others have come to<br/>
enjoy is obviously your prerogative, but it seems a little elitist and<br/>
intolerant.  There's plenty of room out there for all different types of<br/>
boxes for all kinds of boxers.<br/>
<br/>
There may be places where the concentration of letterboxes might get to be a<br/>
concern, but if so, I'd hope that you'd be specific about your concerns,<br/>
such as where the congestion is and what harm you see being done.  The fact<br/>
that CT has lots of boxes does not mean that there's a problem. Regardless<br/>
of what anyone has said tongue-in-cheek, you cannot walk out your door and<br/>
trip over letterboxes, AFAIK. Connecticut is still beautiful and I haven't<br/>
see litterboxes strewn about. It seems to me that you are automatically<br/>
assuming that a lot of boxes means that little thought or care has gone into<br/>
their creation and placement.  Again, you can think or feel whatever you'd<br/>
like, but I disagree.  Plentiful does not mean poor "quality."<br/>
<br/>
If any of us finds that we don't like a cerain type of box or boxes placed<br/>
by a certain placer, we can easily choose to not seek these letterboxes. I<br/>
don't think we necessarily need a renewed interest or emphasis on the<br/>
journey and destination because I see plenty of boxes out there that fit the<br/>
bill.  People will create and seek that kind of box that they enjoy. That is<br/>
how it should be, IMHO.  Maybe you are not using enough discretion choosing<br/>
the boxes you go after.<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully yours,<br/>

to different people. If this distresses you, I can't understand that, but<br/>
would urge you to plant and seek more of the boxes you prefer, and let<br/>
others enjoy what they like. If you want more boxes for longer hikes or<br/>
whatever you feel is good and right about boxing, then create them and seek<br/>
them. Letterboxing is constantly evolving. To think that your style of<br/>
letterboxing is somehow superior or more pure than what others have come to<br/>
enjoy is obviously your prerogative, but it seems a little elitist and<br/>
intolerant. There's plenty of room out there for all different types of<br/>
boxes for all kinds of boxers.<br/>
<br/>
There may be places where the concentration of letterboxes might get to be a<br/>
concern, but if so, I'd hope that you'd be specific about your concerns,<br/>
such as where the congestion is and what harm you see being done. The fact<br/>
that CT has lots of boxes does not mean that there's a problem. Regardless<br/>
of what anyone has said tongue-in-cheek, you cannot walk out your door and<br/>
trip over letterboxes, AFAIK. Connecticut is still beautiful and I haven't<br/>
see litterboxes strewn about. It seems to me that you are automatically<br/>
assuming that a lot of boxes means that little thought or care has gone into<br/>
their creation and placement. Again, you can think or feel whatever you'd<br/>
like, but I disagree. Plentiful does not mean poor "quality."<br/>
<br/>
If any of us finds that we don't like a cerain type of box or boxes placed<br/>
by a certain placer, we can easily choose to not seek these letterboxes. I<br/>
don't think we necessarily need a renewed interest or emphasis on the<br/>
journey and destination because I see plenty of boxes out there that fit the<br/>
bill. People will create and seek that kind of box that they enjoy. That is<br/>
how it should be, IMHO. Maybe you are not using enough discretion choosing<br/>
the boxes you go after.<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully yours,<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Saddness<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The state of letterboxing today saddens me. Having had the pleasure<br/>
&gt; of recently visiting several out of the way letterboxes I noticed<br/>
&gt; that letterboxes which require more than a mile or two of hiking get<br/>
&gt; very few visitors. Now this wasn't a surprise to me but what I did<br/>
&gt; notice is that the older boxes used to get visitors but no longer<br/>
&gt; do. The obvious reason is that once upon a time there were very few<br/>
&gt; boxes and letterboxers tended to seek out all the boxes available.<br/>
&gt; Nowadays, there are so many drive-by boxes few letterboxers seem to<br/>
&gt; bother looking for anything else. I find this distressing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hiking is an integral part of the letterboxing tradition. The<br/>
&gt; original letterbox at Dartmoor required a significant walk to<br/>
&gt; obtain. Even today while pub boxes are all over Dartmoor, the real<br/>
&gt; letterboxing remains out on the moors (pub boxes do not count<br/>
&gt; towards the Dartmoor 100 club). When letterboxing started in the<br/>
&gt; United States, boxes were placed in special places, usually<br/>
&gt; requiring at least a short stroll. Even with the advent of drive-by<br/>
&gt; boxes, they still were placed in special places where you would - by<br/>
&gt; choice - linger for a good while to enjoy the scenery or learn some<br/>
&gt; history. I remember one of the first drive-by boxes I ever found. It<br/>
&gt; was a box hidden near a lighthouse. The clue was clever, the stamp<br/>
&gt; wonderful, and the location incredible. Not only was there a<br/>
&gt; lighthouse to visit, but there was also a short walk down to a rocky<br/>
&gt; beach where we stayed for a good hour enjoying the tide pools,<br/>
&gt; spotting seals in the water, and watching birds on the offshore<br/>
&gt; rocks. Today it seems that boxers quickly simply stamp in at one non-<br/>
&gt; descript playground and drive on to the next for another box. I hope<br/>
&gt; that at least they are enjoying the stamp images and not just<br/>
&gt; looking to raise their F counts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The proliferation of postal letterboxing also distresses me. There<br/>
&gt; is nothing wrong with the exchange of art by mail. Indeed, the<br/>
&gt; first, to my knowledge, postal letterbox was Flutterby. But with<br/>
&gt; Flutterby, it came to you by surprise: it wasn't something you<br/>
&gt; competed to sign up for before the list closed. You were grateful to<br/>
&gt; receive it, and you didn't consider it a letterbox find. Postal<br/>
&gt; letterboxing is not letterboxing, it is simply an exchange of art by<br/>
&gt; mail. By all means participate if you like, but please don't confuse<br/>
&gt; it with letterboxing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wish dearly that everyone would take a few minutes to think about<br/>
&gt; what letterboxing is. The stamp exchange is integral of course, as<br/>
&gt; is the clue. However, what many people are missing is that the<br/>
&gt; location of and the journey to the box are also integral. In our<br/>
&gt; eagerness to share our stamps by planting boxes, we've come to the<br/>
&gt; point where we've forgotten about the location and journey. In our<br/>
&gt; eagerness to collect as many stamps as possible, we've come to go<br/>
&gt; after the easiest boxes to find and thereby missing the beauty of<br/>
&gt; the locations of and journeys to the more time consuming boxes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Will anyone else join me in a renewed emphasis on the location and<br/>
&gt; journey?<br/>

I do miss the "old days" but as a realist - those days are gone!<br/>
<br/>
With the advent of publicity - Time Magazine, Family Fun, etc., etc. - this hobby has grown by leaps and bounds. And with that growth has come families and non-hikers and people from many walks of life with different views as to how this game should be played. <br/>
<br/>
With that much diversity of personalities, there was no choice but to see changes in what we once knew. Enter postal letterboxes, drivebys, mega gatherings. It's easy to see why some veterans long for the days of old. <br/>
<br/>
But it's important to look forward as well. There is some excellent, new talent out there. We've seen some great creativity by groups of new boxers - like the Capers, who readily come to mind.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, our addiction is changing - but sometimes for the good! Let's remain positive and box in our own style with those of like mind. And don't forget the basics . . . <br/>

JUST HAVE FUN &amp; GET OUT THERE &amp; BOX!!!<br/>

We letterbox with a 3 year old and sometimes with a 62 year old.  This<br/>
limits our hikes.  Longer hikes are ok as long as they are flat.  But mostly<br/>
we like to go to drive bys to new places we have never experienced and on<br/>
walks about 1 mile or 2.  This is about all we can expect from a 3 year old.<br/>
<br/>
Boy do we have fun!  The clues, the interesting places we learn about, the<br/>
excitement of the find.  We don't need to hike half a day to the middle of<br/>
no where.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot tell you how much letterboxing has enriched our lives.  It makes<br/>
every place we go magical.<br/>
<br/>
As our child gets older, we will be able to do more difficult letterboxes.<br/>
For now, easier ones are perfect for us.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it's not what was intended, but the way letterboxing is now has<br/>
brought us so much joy.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can certainly relate to Pungent Bob's dismay. There are so many<br/>
wonderful letterboxes here in the PNW that are rarely visited because<br/>
they are located on long hikes. Some of them are historical, e.g.<br/>
Green Tortuga's first stamp carving at Ramona Falls or the very first<br/>
letterbox ever hidden in Oregon by Green Hornet. Others are on<br/>
not-to-be-missed scenic hikes, such as the Eagle Creek Trail.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, not everyone is able to make these treks but few have even<br/>
tried! Searching for some of these letterboxes is the very thing that<br/>
has allowed me to build up my abilities as a longer distance hiker. I<br/>
certainly wasn't fit enough to do them when I first started boxing but<br/>
can do them today. Encouraging folks to rack up their number of finds<br/>
in order to be listed on a website or receive a patch seems to<br/>
aggravate the problem. If you "need" to get your F count to 500 you<br/>
will naturally seek all the easy boxes and pass on the ones that might<br/>
reward you with only one during a day's outing. <br/>
<br/>
I read the commentary on Postal boxes not as criticism of the practice<br/>
but as pointing out that this is a variant of the time honored hobby<br/>
of mail art. It's a mystery to me how one of these ever came to be<br/>
called a "letterbox." The definition of a letterbox in the LbNA FAQs<br/>
clearly states that a letterbox must consist of a clue, a stamp and a<br/>
log. One of the three is clearly missing with the postals. It's a<br/>
great hobby for those who participate but isn't letterboxing at all in<br/>
my book.<br/>
<br/>
Pungent Bob has hidden some of the most creative of letteboxes to be<br/>
found. Few of them are on exhausting mega-mile hikes. The locations<br/>
are always interesting and the journey both mental and physical are<br/>
always good fun. He has created a couple of series that encourage<br/>
other boxers to add on their own creations. You should see the<br/>
wonderful collection his Musician's Series has become! He has never<br/>
been elitist or exclusive in any way, quite the opposite.<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, will answer his call to pay attention to the location and<br/>
journey. That doesn't mean I will be hiding many boxes on far distant<br/>
trails but I will continue to try to hide all my letterboxes in<br/>
locations that are significant in some way. I like to consider<br/>
letterboxing as physical exercise, a grand alternative to the gym. As<br/>
long as I'm lucky enough to have the health to allow, I will be on the<br/>
trail to those distant boxes others have hidden for us to find. Keep<br/>
'em coming! Funhog<br/>

better; not worse. I personally cannot do the long hikes I love -- at least not in this phase <br/>
of my life. I really look forward to them when I retire, however; and I know the boxes will <br/>
be there. In the meantime, I'm very grateful that there are all these short-hike or drive-by <br/>
boxes: We hunt the close-to-home boxes, the ones that only take an hour or two's outing <br/>
time, and have as much fun as we can fit into our busy schedules. I also PLACE my boxes <br/>
in similar spots (parks, areas where the kids and I frequent,) because that is what works <br/>
for me now.  Later, when I have more time, I'm sure my plants can become more elaborate <br/>
and further out in the woods, so to speak. <br/>

There's boxes for everyone out there and we can pick and choose them as it suits us :-)  <br/>

&gt; Hi, Pungent One, <s><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I'm "hearing" from this post is that you are saddened that not everyone<br/>
&gt; likes letterboxing for the same reasons you do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are still plenty of boxes being placed in great places, and there are<br/>
&gt; plenty of boxes that require a hike or take you to a special spot. If this<br/>
&gt; is what you want, then you have it. I don't see a shortage of these.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are short on time, or can't afford the gas to get far away to some<br/>
&gt; scenic area, or it's too hot (or too cold or too wet or too icy), or you are<br/>
&gt; physically not up to a hike because of health issues or small children in<br/>
&gt; tow, there are drive-bys, urban boxes, and postal boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you like the challenge of mysteries or you like straightforward<br/>
&gt; directions, you can have it, and you can create more for others to seek.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the beauties of boxing is that it has different aspects that appeal<br/>
&gt; to different people. If this distresses you, I can't understand that, but<br/>

&gt; &gt; receive it, and you didn't consider it a letterbox find. Postal<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing is not letterboxing, it is simply an exchange of art by<br/>
&gt; &gt; mail. By all means participate if you like, but please don't confuse<br/>
&gt; &gt; it with letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I wish dearly that everyone would take a few minutes to think about<br/>
&gt; &gt; what letterboxing is. The stamp exchange is integral of course, as<br/>
&gt; &gt; is the clue. However, what many people are missing is that the<br/>
&gt; &gt; location of and the journey to the box are also integral. In our<br/>
&gt; &gt; eagerness to share our stamps by planting boxes, we've come to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; point where we've forgotten about the location and journey. In our<br/>
&gt; &gt; eagerness to collect as many stamps as possible, we've come to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; after the easiest boxes to find and thereby missing the beauty of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the locations of and journeys to the more time consuming boxes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Will anyone else join me in a renewed emphasis on the location and<br/>

with longer or energetic hikes (many of the older boxes), or those <br/>
boxes involving a mystery (such as any of the Maprsurfers we have <br/>
found), the finds are accompanied by a much greater sense fo <br/>
accomplishment than others.  We do try to plant some more mentally <br/>
and physically challenging boxes to accompany what I call "family <br/>
boxes".  That way, our little neck of the woods will have a variety <br/>
of opportunities for boxers of all levels and desires to be able to <br/>
satisfy their boxing wants.<br/>
<br/>
As I think we can all agree upon, variety is the spice of life.  <br/>
However; do not fear the classic box that may push you beyond your <br/>
pre-perceived limitations mentally and physically.  You may just <br/>
surprise yourself and be greatly rewarded.<br/>

&gt; The state of letterboxing today saddens me. Having had the pleasure <br/>
&gt; of recently visiting several out of the way letterboxes I noticed <br/>
&gt; that letterboxes which require more than a mile or two of hiking <br/>
get <br/>
&gt; very few visitors. Now this wasn't a surprise to me but what I did <br/>
&gt; notice is that the older boxes used to get visitors but no longer <br/>
&gt; do. The obvious reason is that once upon a time there were very few <br/>
&gt; boxes and letterboxers tended to seek out all the boxes available. <br/>
&gt; Nowadays, there are so many drive-by boxes few letterboxers seem to <br/>
&gt; bother looking for anything else. I find this distressing. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hiking is an integral part of the letterboxing tradition. The <br/>
&gt; original letterbox at Dartmoor required a significant walk to <br/>
&gt; obtain. Even today while pub boxes are all over Dartmoor, the real <br/>
&gt; letterboxing remains out on the moors (pub boxes do not count <br/>
&gt; towards the Dartmoor 100 club). When letterboxing started in the <br/>
&gt; United States, boxes were placed in special places, usually <br/>
&gt; requiring at least a short stroll. Even with the advent of drive-by <br/>
&gt; boxes, they still were placed in special places where you would - <br/>
by <br/>
&gt; choice - linger for a good while to enjoy the scenery or learn some <br/>
&gt; history. I remember one of the first drive-by boxes I ever found. <br/>
It <br/>
&gt; was a box hidden near a lighthouse. The clue was clever, the stamp <br/>
&gt; wonderful, and the location incredible. Not only was there a <br/>
&gt; lighthouse to visit, but there was also a short walk down to a <br/>
rocky <br/>
&gt; beach where we stayed for a good hour enjoying the tide pools, <br/>
&gt; spotting seals in the water, and watching birds on the offshore <br/>
&gt; rocks. Today it seems that boxers quickly simply stamp in at one <br/>
non-<br/>
&gt; descript playground and drive on to the next for another box. I <br/>
hope <br/>
&gt; that at least they are enjoying the stamp images and not just <br/>
&gt; looking to raise their F counts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The proliferation of postal letterboxing also distresses me. There <br/>
&gt; is nothing wrong with the exchange of art by mail. Indeed, the <br/>
&gt; first, to my knowledge, postal letterbox was Flutterby. But with <br/>
&gt; Flutterby, it came to you by surprise: it wasn't something you <br/>
&gt; competed to sign up for before the list closed. You were grateful <br/>
to <br/>
