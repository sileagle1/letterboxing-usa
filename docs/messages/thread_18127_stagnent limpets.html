                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been thinking about this, too.  Just today I placed a LB and on <br/>
my way home I checked on another LB that is not mine, but was right <br/>
on the way.  I had originally found it in the middle of September, we <br/>
were the second finders and we left a HH there. <br/>
<br/>
No one has visited this LB since then!!!  Six months and no one!!  <br/>
The little HH was still sitting there waiting to be picked up.  I <br/>
left him there, hoping that boxing would pick up in Southeastern <br/>
Massachusetts now that the sun is out.  I also know of another HH <br/>
that has been waiting for a ride for about 2 months...If anyone wants <br/>
some hints let me know!!<br/>
