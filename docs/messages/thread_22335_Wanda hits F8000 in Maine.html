Just heard from Wanda up in Maine where she found her 8000th letterbox <br/>
along the Appalachian Trail between the Crockers and the Bigelows. <br/>
Apparently, she got stuck in the "Back Kingdom" yesterday when a big tree <br/>
crashed, bringing down the electric wires and blocking the dead end road <br/>
during a torrential downpour.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm glad to hear that she's safely headed home, and will be planting a <br/>
few boxes in NH on her way back.  Maybe she'll writeup something about her <br/>
trip on our web page next week.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

An unbeatable record?  Who knows, but I think in order to do it<br/>
someone is going to have to start this hobby at a young age!!<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I just crossed the F250 mark on Sunday -- and that's after a<br/>
year of letterboxing.  Geez, I better get busy!<br/>
