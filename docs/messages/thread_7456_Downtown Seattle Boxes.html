                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not sure of any letterboxes in the heart of downtown Seattle but a <br/>
few in the relative vicinity that would not be too difficult to <br/>
reach with adequate transportation would be:  the boxes in Discovery <br/>
Park (a few miles NW of downtown), several in the parks in West <br/>
Seattle, the Kubota Gardens box (SouthEast) &amp; possibly the Mercer <br/>
Island boxes (due East on I-90 &amp; over the bridge).  These would <br/>
require having access to a vehicle or a knowledgable &amp; understanding <br/>
taxi driver.  :)<br/>
<br/>
As for downtown Seattle, I've been trying to figure out locations to <br/>
place them that wouldn't be found quite easily.  Most of the gardens <br/>
in the area are meticulously maintained and I'm sure the box would <br/>
be discovered rather quickly.  Still trying to come up with ideas, <br/>
though...<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your trip to Seattle.  The weather has been awesome of late!<br/>
