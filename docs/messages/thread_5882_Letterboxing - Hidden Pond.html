Letterbox hidden on 6-24-02 at 2pm by J&amp;G with nephew Stevie <br/>
<br/>
Distance one way: 2.78 miles<br/>
<br/>
Terrain Difficulty: Moderate and Tricky - 3/4's of the way follows the<br/>
Sander's Kill stream passing several pools of water and slippery rocks.<br/>
<br/>
No drinkable water along the way without filtration.<br/>
<br/>
Optional Equipment: Step Counter<br/>
<br/>
Bug Repellent may be needed!<br/>
<br/>
Directions /Clues:<br/>
<br/>
1) We parked our Caravan in first loop on the Long Path at Jenny Lane on<br/>
44/55<br/>
2) Walk for one mile 40 degrees True North first passing the last parking<br/>
loop and two little fields followed by a high grass covered path  for a<br/>
total number of  2465 steps. If you see a sign at about 1900 steps you<br/>
are doing fine. [41 45 04N , 74 14 24W on a GPS]  a few more 100 yards to<br/>
 the next point { in the past we have actually bushwhacked here to the<br/>
stream with our dog  "BUD" , it is a more difficult way to go}<br/>
3) After continuing on shortly  you will be at a grassy clearing, make a<br/>
sharp right and go down the hill  southerly for 0.1 (tenth) of a mile. <br/>
4) At the bottom you will be by the stream again and by a hunters cabin.<br/>
5) Continue around the back of the cabin and head downstream for a half<br/>
of a mile.<br/>
6) Within the next few hundred feet , cross over stream. ( total steps<br/>
now about 3826)<br/>
7)Walking  down the right side of the steam for another 1/2 mile you will<br/>
pass posted land on the other side.<br/>
8) At about 5181 steps or about 2.1 miles make a sharp right up tributary<br/>
stream up to falls. (150 yards)<br/>
9) At the top of the falls make a sharp left (over a log) and continue a<br/>
few hundred feet to another fork. <br/>
10) Do not go down the path into the woods! At this second split take the<br/>
right path by the  flat rock area , <br/>
go to the  left edge of the flat rock field , There is a path here into<br/>
the mountain laurel heading uphill in a southerly direction.<br/>
11) Here is where it gets tricky!  Head to the top of the mountain (SE<br/>
140 degrees) and keep to the middle path. Watch out for false side paths.<br/>
At about 6185 steps you will go over a small 2 foot rock wedged on trail<br/>
being used as a bridge over a small crevice. About another 300 yrds to<br/>
Hidden Pond!<br/>
12)Letterbox is under a  loose 14inch by 7 inch rock ,  75 feet  uphill<br/>
(190 degrees South) from the  flat rocks on waters edge where its a good<br/>
place to have a snack.  There is something special about this rock ledge <br/>
, two special features about 10 feet  or so apart form each other on two<br/>
seperate rocks here, one big one  small...................you will know<br/>
when you see it!.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck and have fun finding it!</div>
