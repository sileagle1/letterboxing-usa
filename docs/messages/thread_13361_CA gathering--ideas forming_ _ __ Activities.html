I wouldn't worry about how many get togethers are going to be set up." Plant them and they will come". Also not to worry about how far, heck we are 200 miles from LA and 200 miles from SLO. We may be setting up a spring time get together here in Kernville as it may be the only opportunity to have our 20 boxes hit plus we have another activity "Letterboxing on the river". Don<br/>
