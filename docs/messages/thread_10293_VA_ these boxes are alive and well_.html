                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all:  just wanted to let you know that these boxes<br/>
are alive and well in Virginia:<br/>
<br/>
The Fort Hunt letterbox <br/>
The Runway Box<br/>
  *and*<br/>
The Knowhatdamean Fern? box.<br/>
<br/>
  It was a C*O*L*D day in Northern Virginia, but that<br/>
doesn't stop us crazy letterboxers!<br/>
<br/>
The Fort Hunt box has inspired me to maybe do a series<br/>
on the Fort Hunt batteries. While I was down there, I<br/>
was scouting out possible sites. That place has some<br/>
great history, and it would be fun to tie that in.<br/>
<br/>
The Runway box is well-hidden and there is a great<br/>
view of the planes (and a cold wind blowing off the<br/>
Potomac)<br/>
<br/>
The Knowhatdamean Fern box is still there, despite the<br/>
new boardwalk.  Follow the updated directions and it<br/>
should be easy to find.  Bring your compass! I finally<br/>
understood the name of this box.  On the clue list, it<br/>
says "knowhadamean" - which I broke up into<br/>
know-had-a-mean fern - I'm thinking: you had a mean<br/>
fern?  I didn't get it until I found the box, and<br/>
realized the 'T' was left out.  Oh, Now I get it!  <br/>
Duh!<br/>
<br/>
My next forays will be for the Riverside box, and I'm<br/>
going to attempt to find the other box on Teddy<br/>
Roosevelt Island. Musings from this list cause me to<br/>
think it is still there, and I just wasn't in the<br/>
right place.<br/>
<br/>
I've been lucky enough to be able to look for boxes<br/>
during the week when park visitation is low (and it's<br/>
been so cold lately that know one in their right mind,<br/>
except us die-hard LBers would be out)so I've had the<br/>
leisure to spend time reading the logs.  It was good<br/>
to see Amanda from Seattle's stamp in the runway box.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry I won't be able to make the DC gathering.  I<br/>
work on weekends (that's why I can track down boxes on<br/>
Mondays and Tuesdays), and am only free after 4:30. <br/>
Next time if the gathering is a weekend, maybe it<br/>
could be later in the day? -  because I'd love to meet<br/>
all the folks around here.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
<br/>
