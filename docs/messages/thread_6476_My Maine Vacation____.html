                    <html><body>While letterboxing is fun, my first love is shopping so I know all about it! While you're exploring L.L. Bean in Freeport, there's a great store you won't want to miss if it's Moose you're after. About a block from L.L. Bean on the other side of the street is "The Mangy Moose", with everything "moose" from boxer shorts to Xmas ornaments.
<br/>
<br/>I've only been to the coast as far north as Bar Harbor, which might be everyone's idea of the place to go, but I found it rather tacky, expensive and touristy. However, Mr. Desert Island and Acadia Park are definitely worth it! Camden, another coast town was much more quaint. Augusta, the capital, is not worth going to at all. Basically, off the beaten path you'll find what you expect in Maine.
<br/>
<br/>Have a great time!

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would have to second the Acadia and Bar Harbor<br/>
suggestions.  Really great places to visit.  The Old<br/>
Port section of Portland is a neat place to walk<br/>
around, too.  Agusta could definitly be by-passed (I<br/>
use to live up that way, so ;oP)<br/>
<br/>
As for actually seeing a moose, you probably will need<br/>
to head north.  If you are into hiking and the<br/>
out-of-doors (along with a few misquitos) Baxter State<br/>
Park is a great place to visit, too.  Some really<br/>
wonderful hiking up there.  It is at the Northern part<br/>
of the state, about 1.5 - 2 hours north of Bangor, 30<br/>
min from Millinockett.<br/>
<br/>
If you enter at the parks sothern gate (the one near<br/>
millinocket), there is a short hike to place called<br/>
Sandy Bottom Stream Pond (I think it is about a mile<br/>
each way).  Anyway, it is cute little pond that almost<br/>
always has several moose hanging out.<br/>
<br/>
To get to the trail head, you will need to go to the<br/>
Roaring Brook parking lot.  This is a popular place,<br/>
however, and you may find that the lot has been closed<br/>
at certian times of the day because of to many people<br/>
being there.  The rangers at the gate are very helpful<br/>
thouogh.  Also be sure to visit the ranger station at<br/>
Roaring Brook to check in and set the "moose dial"<br/>
before setting out on your hike.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Baxter State Park is a wonderful spot, and Katahdin is my favorite mountain<br/>
in the northeast. Some people park on the outskirts of the park (e.g. the<br/>
previously mentioned Roaring Brook campground, hike in (3.3 miles to Chimney<br/>
Pond), climb Katahdin, and hike out all in one day. This is very arduous!!<br/>
You need many hours and have to be in great shape. Most folks will try to<br/>
get campsites at places such as Chimney Pond, and take two or three days.<br/>
Many of these campsites, however, must be reserved months in advance.<br/>
<br/>
So if you are really interested in spending time in Baxter, you will need to<br/>
get some maps, do some planning, and make some contacts in advance.<br/>

A lontime favorite of our is the fort at Bucksport. Again it is North <br/>
some say maine doesn't start til after Boothbay harbor.  Another nice <br/>
spot is Campobello Island  home to the Roosevelts for a time. My <br/>
family waited for the ferry one day and  the pilot of it had an <br/>
argument with another ferry pilot and he went home mad!  _ Only in <br/>
maine!  My favorite camping place is  Cobscook state park but I <br/>
haven't been in years. My famly is in to rustic vacations Have a <br/>
great vacation whatever you do! Leader of the Pack<br/>

great for picnics and beach.  We camped last year outside of Bath, had a<br/>
wonderful time going to the Maine Maritime Museum, seeing the ships being<br/>
build at the Bath Iron Works, and going up to Pemaquid Lighthouse.  Boothbay<br/>
Harbor was way too touristy for us, but we did go to the Lobster Coop for<br/>
some steamed lobster and clams, corn on the cob.   Another good place for<br/>
lobster is the restuarant on the LEFT hand side as you cross the historic<br/>
Cobwork Bridge going to Bailey Island (Get to Brunswick, Rte 24 out on the<br/>
peninsula).  The rest. on the right has been featured in Visa commercials,<br/>
the prices on the menu showed it.  The other rest. is a great one to really<br/>
dig into your lobster, and its great to bring kids to!  Enjoy your<br/>
tion!     - Kittlekatz<br/>

                    <html><body><p> Living in the most Eastern part of the state, I'm not that objective, but I can tell you that when all the relatives descend in the summer (not too many in the winter, tho I can't imagine why!), I put on my tour guide hat.  For letterboxing vacations, My Two Cats and Legerdemaine have provided enough for a weeks worth of vacationing in the Bucksport/Bar Harbor area alone!  The area is about a  two hour drive from Rockport. You'll discover some lovely, interesting towns,too.  For the real Downeast feel tho, I'd head a little further down RT 1, making sure you stop at the lesser visited Acadia National Park site in Winter Harbor called Schoodic Point.  The Schoodic Arts festival is going on that week too, so it'll be well worth the trip.   Keep on going east for another couple hours, and you'll end up at Quoddy Head, in Lubec, which is the easternmost point in the continental USA.  Just a short trip over and you'll be able to visit Campobello, Canada.  You'll probably increase your chances of seeing a moose the further north you go. They'll occassionaly wander onto I-95 into Bangor.  Guess they want to see where Stephen King lives too.  If seeing a moose is your priority, I'll have to concede the eastern side of the state (tho they've wandered through my yard), and say your chances definitately increase in Baxter State Park.  I guess you're going to have to take 2 weeks off.
</p><p>BTW, we were just up at Cobscook Bay.  It's beautiful.  It could use a letterbox.  
</p><p>Let me know if you have any more questions.  I'll be in the laundry room, ironing my tour guide uniform!

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My husband and I have been vacationing in Maine for 20 years. We started<br/>
with an article from Better Homes and Gardens outlining a trip up the<br/>
coast. We spent a week finishing up in Acadia. I really love the area<br/>
between Boothbay and Lincolnville Beach on Rt. 1. We wound up spending<br/>
the next years at a great little motel on Rt. 1 in Camden, though. It<br/>
was central to most of the places we wanted to see and when we wanted to<br/>
hang it was great. The name of the place is Beloin's. If you go there,<br/>
get one of the cabins on the bay. They are right on the rocks, little<br/>
kitchenette, clean. Built in the 30's or 40's. Towels are thin, but very<br/>
clean. Next door is Mt. Batty State Park. It's on both sides of the<br/>
road. Mountain with lookout on the inland side and park going down to<br/>
water on the other.<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to go to Rockport just south of Camden. They have a great art<br/>
gallery. Camden is busy. Many sailing adventure boats leave from Camden.<br/>
Lots of good restaurants and great shopping. Then back to the woods and<br/>
water at the motel.<br/>
<br/>
Not affiliated with the place. Just love to go and hang out by the<br/>
water. :-)<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] My Maine Vacation!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I am leaving on Sunday, July 28th for a week long vacation to Maine. <br/>
This is the first vacation I have taken in 12 years.  The problem is <br/>
I have never been to Maine.  I have always wanted to go ... but never <br/>
found the time.  I decided to let the Maine letterboxes lead me <br/>
through my travels.  I also found some interesting activities that <br/>
are scheduled for this weekend such as the Maine Festival, Lobster <br/>
Fest, and a Beach Exploration.  Other than that I would like to visit <br/>
L.L. Bean in Freeport and I'd die to see a moose!  :)<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping some letterboxers would give me some suggestions as to <br/>
where I should go.  Maybe some lone letterboxer will be in Maine at <br/>
the same time ... an exchange would be excellent.<br/>
<br/>
Hope all is well in everyones lives.  L8r-  Letterboxer2002 (alan)<br/>

<br/>
While in Freeport, you can also check out Wolf Neck<br/>
State Park, which is suppose to be wonderful.  There<br/>
were letterboxes there, but they have since gone on<br/>
walk-about.<br/>
<br/>
And the Fort in Bucksport is called Fort Knox.<br/>
<br/>
A great resource, for parks, campsites, historical<br/>
places, hikes, in DeLorme's Maine Atlas.  The front<br/>
few pages are full of really great info!!<br/>
<br/>
As for one day hikes up Katahdin and back - you have<br/>
to be at the gate when they open, and bring a<br/>
flashlight for the way out ;o).  I have done the trip<br/>
described by Mr Cooch about 7 times, and it generally<br/>
takes about 12 hours round trip (and I am not in the<br/>
greatest of shape).  I think we figured it to be<br/>
around 20 miles round trip.  Lots a fun though, and<br/>
great geology!!<br/>
<br/>
Have a great trip!<br/>

The fort it is located at is beautiful!  It is not<br/>

The Rings of Heaven box is also a great one to check<br/>

the coast or head out to Popham or Baily Island.<br/>

<br/>
It's a BIG state, I don't think you'll have time to see it all. Better <br/>
plan on going back a few times. Summer is a blast anywhere along the <br/>
shore.<br/>
<br/>
This fall or winter, go back and head up north. Take your bike <br/>
&amp;/or skis. That's when you'll see moose. Be careful on those dark, <br/>
winding roads at night -- moose are too tall for their eyes to reflect <br/>
headlights like other animals.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't mind seeing a captive moose, then the state has a Game <br/>
Farm in Gray (Exit 11 off the Turnpike, follow signs to Rt 26 North, <br/>
watch for it on right, see troopers barracks you've just past it). <br/>
They also have a trout hatchery and many other native animals.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!! ~ Aili<br/>
