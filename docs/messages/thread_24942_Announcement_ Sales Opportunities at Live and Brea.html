                    <div class="plaintext-content">While we will not be providing a formal vending area during the We <br/>
Live and Breathe Letterboxing Gathering, we do recognize that some <br/>
letterboxers have merchandise for sale and would like to take this <br/>
opportunity to show others their wares.  For that purpose, we will <br/>
make available a bulletin board for sellers to place a flyer of their <br/>
own design.  Please include any information you would like for others <br/>
to know about your items, including when they can try to find you <br/>
during the gathering and what you will have available.  We do ask <br/>
that you please keep things low-key, to avoid interfering with other <br/>
gathering activities and to help us maintain a casual, non-commercial <br/>
atmosphere throughout the event.  Please send any questions to: <br/>
mail@weliveandbreathe.com.  <br/>
<br/>
Suggestions on Content:<br/>
--Keep the size of your flyer only as large as it needs to be so we <br/>
have room for everyone, with a maximum size of 8.5" x 11."<br/>
--If you would like for others to find you at your cabin, you may <br/>
want to design a flyer that has blanks that can be filled in when you <br/>
know your cabin assignment.<br/>
--If you would only like to be available during public gathering <br/>
times, such as the Friday night campfire, mealtimes, or the Saturday <br/>
Masquerade Ball, please refer to the Schedule of Events on <br/>
www.weliveandbreathe.com for a general timetable.  <br/>
--Consider including a photograph or a physical description of <br/>
yourself, or a description of something you might be wearing, so that <br/>
others can pick you out of a group.<br/>
--If you do not want to bring your merchandise with you but would <br/>
still like to advertise, feel free to only include contact info or a <br/>
web URL, or even just a note to let others know that you have price <br/>
lists and/or order forms with you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For Those Not Attending:<br/>
Feel free to make up a flyer that includes your contact information <br/>
and anything else you think people would want to know about your <br/>
items and we will be happy to print it out for you to include on the <br/>
board.  Please keep the size to 8.5"x11" or smaller and send this <br/>
information as an attachment in Microsoft Word or PDF format to <br/>
mail@weliveandbreath.com.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks!  RaqsEnigma<br/>
