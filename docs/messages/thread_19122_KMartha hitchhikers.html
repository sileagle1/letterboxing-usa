<br/>
  a.. KMartha is a hitchhiker stamp whose travels have spawned some of the most creative and entertaining self-deprecating humorous writing and insight into our own messy lives complete with mud, unruly and wondrous kids, unmatched silverware, chipped plates and the kind of discordant but dry costumes one wears home after camping in the rain for a few days. <br/>
  b.. there are several KMartha hitchhikers<br/>
  c.. Martha Stewart gave us some of the best interior print and texture materials and accessories available to the everyday budget - no small feat in an ever moving to mediocrity design selection at real world prices. Martha's shows and magazines helped us celebrate some of the best things in our existence: home, family, safe haven, treating oneself and friends well, good food, beautiful surroundings.  We all understand that capturing some sense of this fantasy world is the best we can do.<br/>
  d.. Her shows are entertaining on several levels, including humor.<br/>
  e.. I, personally, did not participate in any of the writings on KMartha but I did find them funny and creative.  They did poke fun at her AND at ourselves.<br/>
  f.. There are things on this list that sometimes you just need to  let go but if you venture into the discussion, all bets are off.<br/>
  g.. I do not remember much discussion on the pros and cons of the court case.<br/>
  h.. It's all inappropriate, insider trading, whether it is Enron or Martha's $10,000<br/>
  i.. The trial was a morality play for the public in the best sense of the word - it is a parable demonstrating right and wrong.  In such cases a central figure is required, Martha was the unlucky central figure;  a case of luck or bad luck.  It is also a case demonstrating right or wrong; to debate the relative dollars involved is immaterial when one considers the lesson.<br/>
Thank you for listening and please consider that different persons can react in divergent ways to the same information.   A truce would be a wonderful thing to hear from all of you.<br/>

With deep appreciation for all your passion - particularly letterboxing.<br/>

No, she never did a show.  That first post was actually an April <br/>
Fool's joke.  (Sure, that post is dated March 31st, but it was posted <br/>
late in the day and most people probably didn't get on the board to <br/>
read it until April 1st.)  So far as anyone where knows, the real <br/>
Martha Stewart has never even heard of letterboxing, nor anything <br/>
about the long-running joke associated with her.  =)<br/>

Sometimes, us old-timers forget that new letterboxers aren't familiar <br/>
with the long-standing inside jokes and may misinterpret some of the <br/>
posts.  But rest assured, the joke started long before Martha had any <br/>
of her legal problems.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Now that is funny!  I must admit some of the posts leave me <br/>
scratching my head.  I figure it is either an insider joke or "old <br/>
timers" finding ways of placing messages that the newbies won't <br/>
understand so keep some of the earlier "pureness" or "secretiveness" <br/>
of the sport.  I figure if I am around long enough and prove myself <br/>
worthy enough someone will eventually let me in on how to find <br/>
unposted boxes etc.  Until then, I'll box and learn and read and <br/>
learn.<br/>
