by The Duffy's and it came from the"Bay Bridge Landing" in Brunswick, <br/>
Me. Oh such great memories I have of The Maine Event in Brunswick and <br/>
here this HH has followed me home :-)<br/>
I also met a dad with two kids in tow doing the Dep box in Nathan <br/>
Hale Forest but he didn't know about letterboxing so he got a quick <br/>
briefing on it trailside, the little ones were quite excited.<br/>
And then I got to do an exchange with Humming Bird and Biker Boxer at <br/>
the John Wayne Series.<br/>
