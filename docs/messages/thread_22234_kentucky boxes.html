&gt; which ones in KY are missing? <br/>
<br/>
We found Fuzzy Bat in Cave City and Red River gorgeous. The Visitors <br/>
Center in Bardstown has moved to a new location and no one we found <br/>
could remember where the old location was. We went to the best guess <br/>
but there was no more stone wall. The Dog run box in Lexington is <br/>
missing, Letterboxing 101 the clues led no where. I think it was a <br/>
prank because the grassy trail we found was loaded with booby traps; <br/>
fishing oine tied to baseballs and sharp sticks.<br/>
We tried Oldtown covered bridge. No box and someone had used the guard <br/>
rail as a toilet. 2 out of 3 boxes at Greenbo lake are missing and <br/>
then we could not find the right cemetery in Huntington, WV,<br/>
It made for a very bad day.<br/>
