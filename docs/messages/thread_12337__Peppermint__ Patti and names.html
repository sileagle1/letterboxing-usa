I have had so much fun learning the reasons behind everyones names.  I feel like I know you all better.<br/>

Cadenza<br/>
<br/>
ps. I explained why I chose my name but not the meaning, which is a huge part of why I chose it.  A cadenza is the section in a concerto where the orchestra drops out and the soloist is left alone to show their virtuosity.  It is the moment they stand alone and shine and really show what they are made of.  I liked it because even though I am a social worker by trade, I play the violin in my local symphony.  It is my way of escaping from the world and doing something that brings me joy and yet, serendipitously, happens to also benefit the community.  I like the symbolism of the cadenza standing out while the others step back.<br/>
