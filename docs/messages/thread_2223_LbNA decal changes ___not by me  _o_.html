 The shop told me that Kay Mohmers(who did the first<br/>
 patch order) made the changes to the design after we<br/>
 sent in the order. To my knowledge, the group was<br/>
 never consulted on this. Believe me, I would not dare<br/>
 make a change like that without first taking a group<br/>
 consensus and receiving everyone’s permission!<br/>
<br/>
 Because of that change, I could not use the postage or<br/>
 envelopes that everyone generously sent and I did not<br/>
 want to fold the decals to make them fit. That is why<br/>
 most of you got your orders in a different (oversize)<br/>
 enveloope.<br/>
<br/>
 Kay Mohmers, if you’re out there...did the embroidery<br/>
 shop tell me correctly? Did you change the decals and<br/>
 not check with any of us who sent in money?. If so,<br/>
 shame on you. If not, do you know who did then?<br/>

Hi Valerie,  There must be some confusion.  I haven't done anything with or <br/>
for the decals since I made the first order.  <br/>
  Believe me, I was happy not to do the second order and kept my little <br/>
fingers out of it.   <br/>
   By the way ... I am expecting to pick up the first merit badge order <br/>
Friday which would be tommorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Are the decals way too big?<br/>
<br/>
Waiting to here from you,<br/>
<br/>

I know it's more work for you, Val and Kay, but do you think if you <br/>
both went back to the company and showed them that it was their <br/>
mistake that they would make us the decals the correct size?  They <br/>
are really too big to be useful.  I would be more than willing to <br/>
send stamps and another envelope (plus pay you the extra you are out, <br/>
Val).<br/>
