Planted by Will (age 11)<br/>
easy half hour walk<br/>
<br/>
Find the Malerbo Soccer Field at 441 Emmett St. in the Forestville<br/>
section of Bristol off Rt. 72.  Enter the driveway and park straight<br/>
ahead near a sign board. Take the path to the right of the sign that says<br/>
Pine Lake Challenge Course. At the first fork stay left and follow the<br/>
main trail, cross over a wooden bridge, ignoring the path on the right<br/>
and climb over a log to cross over another wooden bridge. Stay straight<br/>
on the main path and soon you'll see glimpses of the challenge course on<br/>
your left. Investigate if you wish (if it's not in use) but the treasure<br/>
lies ahead of you.. When you come to a gravel path, turn right and cross<br/>
over a cement pipe bridge built by Pepin Steel and Iron Works (the sign<br/>
says so). Once over the bridge, the gravel way goes straight you want the<br/>
wood chips path on your right and ahead of you, you will see logs on both<br/>
sides of the trail. At the far end of the log on the left, you will find<br/>
The Mutant Swamp Frog Letterbox. Stamp in, carefully re hide the box and<br/>
retrace your steps back to your car.<br/>
<br/>
Now head towards the soccer fields, taking a moment to read the plaque at<br/>
the flagpole, then follow the fence to the right. At the next corner turn<br/>
left, being considerate if a game's in progress, and soon you'll be on a<br/>
sandy path. At the next corner turn left once more and watch for the<br/>
place where the fence becomes lower, also marked by a pine tree on the<br/>
right. Here on the right you'll see a path and 11 steps into the woods on<br/>
your left you'll find the Soccer Challenge Letterbox (the stamp was my<br/>
first signature stamp) in an upright log. <br/>
Be careful not to be seen. Hope you had a good time.<br/>
