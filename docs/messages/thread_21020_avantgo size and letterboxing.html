Hi, I read with great interest the saving of states clues on the <br/>
pda.  I too have avantgo (free account of 2 MB)  How much space does <br/>
the letterboxing take.  I know it would be more for some states, (I <br/>
would need eastern CT, a large amount!)  Would I need to upgrade to <br/>
8 mb...and would that be enough?  Thanks for all your help.<br/>

Here is the amount of room I currently leave for each of my channels -<br/>
 every now and then I need to go in and bump one up - you'll just <br/>
need to experiment at first to see what size you'll need for each <br/>
channel. If you can't link to some clues, just try increasing the <br/>
size allowable, and perhaps bumping up the link depth.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Pennsylvania Letterboxes 800k <br/>
New Jersey Mystery Letterboxes 450k <br/>
Northern New Jersey Letterboxes 650k <br/>
Pennsylvania Mystery Letterboxes 250k <br/>
Southeastern New York Letterboxes 400k <br/>
Southern New Jersey Letterboxes 200k <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
