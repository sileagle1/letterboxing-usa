I just sent this exact answer to the Newboxers list, so I'll repost <br/>
it here, while it's handy!   You may want to join that Yahoo group... <br/>
they're really good about answering <br/>
questions.  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how in-depth the magazine you saw was, but there's a ton <br/>
of information that they probably didn't cover.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the most important aspects are to be stealthy so that people <br/>
do not see you retrieve or replace the boxes; put the box back in the <br/>
same place you found it and cover it up really well to make sure it's <br/>
not visible to people who do not letterbox; be nice to the <br/>
environment; close up the baggies and boxes tightly to protect from <br/>
water damage...<br/>
<br/>
The best thing to do is read a lot about it first.  Here are a few <br/>
good places to start...<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/GettingStarted/<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/aboutlb/<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/files/<br/>
<br/>
Once you've read up on things and poked around those two first sites, <br/>
you'll be able to search for clues in your area.  A lot of planters <br/>
list their clues on both of the sites so there is some overlap, but <br/>
there are also plenty who only use one site or the other.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
