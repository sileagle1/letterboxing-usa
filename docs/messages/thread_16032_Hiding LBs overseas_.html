I REALLY want to send letterboxing supplies to Kris, and at the same<br/>
time have a fear of something going horribly wrong down the line. <br/>
This way it'll still be fun, in fact it could even be more fun and<br/>
involve a lot more plotting &amp; cleverness. <br/>

A very interesting idea! Can you give me more details?<br/>
<br/>
The way I read it is:<br/>
<br/>
1. An actual person has control of the box at all times....<br/>
2. You decipher the clues which then lead you to a particular location...<br/>
3. Then the clues lead you to the "box keeper"...<br/>
4. Who in turn then allows acess to the box...thus a successful exchange between boxer and box...<br/>
<br/>
Sounds rather interesting....and much safer for reasons that many have previously addressed.<br/>
<br/>
What does everyone think of this idea.......?<br/>
<br/>
I think that it will work well!<br/>

I think that sounds like a great idea!  And I like the postcard idea <br/>
too, and would like to participate in that. Sign me up!  :)<br/>

I think this is a much better way to cover/deal with the potential problems<br/>
that could exist in hiding letterboxes in a warzone or other inappropriate<br/>
places.  I am so glad that someone came up with this simple idea.  Shows<br/>
what can happen when adults discuss something and think it through.<br/>
