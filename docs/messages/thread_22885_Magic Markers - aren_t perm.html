images of the letterbox stamps, that look great in your logbook, I<br/>
would  remind you that most markers use a water-based dye ink and will<br/>
not stand up to a soggy logbook.  It's likely that signature stamps<br/>
made with markers will be some of the ones that the box owner never<br/>
gets to see if the logbook gets wet for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking as a placer ... that would dissappoint me.<br/>

&gt; I carry a magic marker with me for my signature stamp to stamp in the <br/>
longbooks I find it works very well.  (snip) I also have other colors<br/>
I carry just in case I may need them for the books that have no ink<br/>
pads or markers or the stamp ink dosn't work, the magic markers are<br/>
rather cheap too. &lt;<br/>
