When replying to Joe's post, it isn't necessary to include every single <br/>
word that he wrote for his clues. The waste of bandwidth speaks of an <br/>
amateurism I know not to exist in a couple of you "veterans".<br/>
<br/>
If you must make smart ass remarks to people, just don't include the entire <br/>
text of the original. Go ahead, fire away at me. I can take it.<br/>

Amateurism? What do you call sending your message to the whole list when it<br/>
was addressed to 4 people?<br/>
<br/>
Hypocritical.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, excuse me for MY waste of bandwidth. Yahoo can handle it considering<br/>
the graphics crap they tag to each post and you can handle it by kill<br/>
filtering anything with my name on it. Pretty simple, ehh rookie?<br/>

<br/>
Let me spell it out for you.<br/>
<br/>
I receive this list in digest form. The four of you are only the latest on <br/>
this list to make that error. There are some who have included the entire <br/>
digest (!) in their response.<br/>
<br/>
I felt that replying to you four on the list would cause a lot more people <br/>
than you four to look at how they respond to e-mail lists and digests.<br/>
<br/>
Glenn, if you had even a slight bit of fairness and understanding of others <br/>
in your seemingly eternally mean bones, you would understand that not <br/>
everyone has enough time at work to waste their companies resources and T1 <br/>
connections surfing the Internet. I'm not suggesting you do, but please <br/>
remember that some of us still connect at 28.8 or 33.6 or if we're real <br/>
lucky at 36.2.<br/>
<br/>
Next time, when someone points out that you made a basic e-mail etiquette <br/>
mistake, don't attack them. Learn from your mistake. Being mean is easy. <br/>
Attacking my signature by mimicking it was childish, by the way.<br/>
