<br/>
This box is a little more of a hike (at least coming back) and with less<br/>
explicit directions. From the last box, find your way to the bluff and head<br/>
down to the beach (look for signs to the Colman Pool). From the Colman pool,<br/>
head down the path, along the beach, North. Follow the path until you are a<br/>
little ways past the end of the sea wall. You will see a path on the right<br/>
that heads up the steep bluff. Go only a short distance up the path and you<br/>
will see a few logs on your right and a less distinctive path that goes to<br/>
the right. You will find a large mossy tree on your right. The box is hidden<br/>
at the base.<br/>
