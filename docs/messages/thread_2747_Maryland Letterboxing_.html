We had a great trip to Maryland, and a fun adventure taking the Metro from <br/>
Greenbelt to DC !! I got motion sick (didn't chuck, just felt yuck), on the <br/>
Metro and had to close my eyes the whole way down...thankfully the trip back <br/>
was better...<br/>
It was wonderful to see the Memorials again as an adult. For some reason the <br/>
Air and Space Museum seemed a little smaller then I remember...must be the <br/>
span of time between 8 and 45 yrs.old!!!<br/>
We stamped into 4 of Squirrel's letterboxes and were the 1st to stamp into <br/>
"Hughes Hollow Pine Grove" in Potomac, Md.!!! What an interesting place...I <br/>
started looking for transient alligators as we walked along!<br/>
Thanks to those who e-mailed with ideas for our journey :)<br/>
<br/>
See Joy and Lockmaster<br/>
