Squirrel's Hughes Hollow box was my 100th find.  I had to dodge the hunters' bullets to get it, but I escaped safely.  Good thing I remembered to wear orange.<br/>
<br/>
On my way to Hughes Hollow I hid a box at Seneca School House.  Clues to follow.<br/>

Many thanks to all the MD, VA, DC, and DE letterboxers who were kind enough to hide 100 boxes for me to find!<br/>
