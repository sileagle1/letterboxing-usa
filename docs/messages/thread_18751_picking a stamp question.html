   Picking a personal stamp is entirely arbitrary. Here's just a few <br/>
select examples of what the locals around here use:<br/>
* We carved a stamp featuring an actual image of our pride and joy - <br/>
our labrador retriever. <br/>
* Butterfly uses...a butterfly! With her name on it!<br/>
* Bluebird - A bluebird house with her zip code.<br/>
* Sadie and Russ - A carvng with their names and a shore scene (and a <br/>
fine carving!). <br/>
* LobstaLady - One guess..its red, and ya find it in Maine. <br/>
<br/>
Ultimately you will find something that fits you well. Off the self <br/>
stamps are wonderful initially and you can ALWAYS change your stamp. <br/>
Some change yearly.  One nice thing to do if/when you carve your own <br/>
is to include your trail name on it. It definately saves time writing <br/>
it out. We've also seen one clever 'boxer make her stamp small enough <br/>
to fit on blank address-type labels. She can then just peel and stick <br/>
as she goes.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps?<br/>

<br/>
Just think about what you like and ideas will come.  I LOVE turtles <br/>
so our first stamp was a store-bought box turtle stamp.  Over time, I <br/>
started carving stamps to place in letterboxes so I carved my own sea <br/>
turtle stamp and my boyfriend LOVES Chevelles (they are a type of old <br/>
muscle car - he has a beautifully restored '68 SS) so I carved Jay an <br/>
image of a Chevelle.  <br/>
<br/>
It helped me to know that whatever you pick is not permanent.  You <br/>
CAN change your stamp image!  Just a few days ago, we found a <br/>
hitchhiker that we had found months ago.  It had our old box turtle <br/>
stamp in it, so we re-stamped in with our new more personal hand-<br/>
carved stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this inspires you to make a choice and get carving!<br/>

<br/>
If you are going for a store-bought stamp, you'd be surprised at the variety <br/>
of images there are - especially with scrap-booking becoming as popular as it <br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to carve your own stamp, you could combine some images to <br/>
make your stamp a true reflection of you.<br/>
<br/>
Try to get to a LB gathering if you can. You'll see such a variety of images, <br/>
it might help give you inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, there's nothing wrong with changing your mind later on.<br/>

I have actually thought of the *perfect* idea for me.  I think I'm <br/>
starting over, that does it! lol.<br/>
I'm gonna do a stamp of that optical illusion that looks like a young <br/>
woman if you look at it one way and an old lady if you look at it <br/>
another.  I'm 25 and look like a young woman to everyone, but feel <br/>
like I'm about 85.  My husband always jokes that I'm really a little <br/>
old lady because I have all of these health problems and I sit and <br/>

likeminded people in the SCA.  And, being of German descent (As in ancestry, not as in falling down, though I do a darn good<br/>
impression of  'Bratwurst unt Beer @ Oktoberfest!!!') I took the Raven wings and the fmaily unit and chewed it up a little and came<br/>
up with the Rayvenhaus (No, I didn't typo it either, I meant to smell it that, er, spell it that way!)<br/>
<br/>
And that Tommy, is how the imfamous Team Rayvenhaus came to be. And there was much gnashing of teeth and wailing and the heavens did<br/>
burst open and pour dow.............. Wait, wrong story, forget I said that last part!!!<br/>

I am a corporate trainer by profession and when I am stuck on a project or have no clue where to begin I do something called mind mapping. Write what it is you are trying to do in a circle in the center of a piece of paper, in this case PERSONAL STAMP. Then just write ideas all over the paper as they come to you. Don't judge or discard any of them, just let the ideas flow. As many have already told you, think of hobbies, favorite places, pets, TV shows, cars, music, people, personality or physical traits, etc. Just write the words down as they come to you whether they make sense or not. When you've run out of words look at what you have written down and start to puzzle it together. You might figure out something you really like. Or not. This is just something I find helpful when I am stuck for ideas or have too many floating about in my head to be able to get started. Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
Personal stamp ideas come from all directions.  Pets, hobbies, <br/>
names, occupations, interests.  Or just an image you really like and <br/>
think you could carve.  Lots of people start with store-bought <br/>
stamps and then carve later.  Some folks keep the bought stamps <br/>
forever.  Some people change stamps; some change often.<br/>
<br/>
My personal stamp is the logo of my consulting company.  I designed <br/>
it nearly 15 years ago - it's just a stylized version of my surname <br/>
initial.  Very easy to carve, which was good since it was my very <br/>
first carving!<br/>
<br/>
If I were HomemakingMommy, I might do a silhouette of Betty Crocker <br/>
(one of the older models), or the Betty Crocker spoon logo.<br/>
<br/>
If bread baking were my homemaking forte, I might carve a loaf of <br/>
bread, or a sheaf of wheat, or both together somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you'd like to meet at one of the Baton Rouge coffee <br/>
shops for a carving lesson!  I'm also available from time to time as <br/>
a substitute grandmother. :-)<br/>

Tara!  In a short time I've come to really look forward to your posts...  I started<br/>
reading this one and thought. "Hmmm who ELSE would be recarving yet again<br/>

&gt; I'm gonna do a stamp of that optical illusion that looks like a young <br/>

Well Timmy you don't have to buy one ,just sport on down to the <br/>
worst part of town wearing your "Get a Clue" tee shirt, stick out <br/>
your thumb and you be one. When some one stops just make sure you <br/>
tell them that you are a"newby" and ask them to show you <br/>
the "ropes". Now to get that tee shirt you must do your home work <br/>
and find Silent Doug's web site, and when you do check out all the <br/>
other info listed. Otherwise you will remain a "newby" <br/>
