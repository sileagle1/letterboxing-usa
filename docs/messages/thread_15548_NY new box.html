BIG SLICK AND THE ACE OF DIAMONDS:<br/>
<br/>
Big Slick walked along the path that led into the woods, silently<br/>
cursing Dalliance for getting him into this whole mess.  Could she<br/>
have rented a boat, nah, she always had to walk, always had to hike. <br/>
If it wasn't for that danged female and her dumb wartime mystery<br/>
fantasies he wouldn't be stumbling along in the hot, humid August<br/>
night.  So here he was miserable, tired, thirsty and "WOULD SOMEONE<br/>
PLEASE JUST TELL ME WHERE THE ACE OF DIAMONDS IS . . . PLEASE!" <br/>
Sheese, no one around but the deep green waters, the trees and a lot<br/>
of dirt.  What are these things anyway Big Slick thought as he stared<br/>
down at what he stood on.  Thing looks like a bunker in fact this was<br/>
the second one he came upon.  Now what was it that Dalliance was<br/>
saying about this bunker thing, something about giant double snakes,<br/>
22 steps, "snakes, snake eyes, that woman's nuts" he muttered out<br/>
loud, how'd she say it "Snake eyes by the look of things - those trees<br/>
by the lay of things" or something stupid like that.  Yeah, all right,<br/>
got it.  Nice skeeters he thought swatting and hopping around trying<br/>
to find a place in the night air that held no blood sucking bugs.  Big<br/>
Slick, wishing he remembered his flashlight, snorted at the thought of<br/>
Dalliance stinking up a room with her "Eau du Cutter" as she called<br/>
it, but secretly wishing he brought his.  What'd that daffy dame say<br/>
about the "Count" what does he have to do with it?  The Count Black<br/>
Jack . . . no . . . it's count black jack.  Count black jack?  Big<br/>
Slick pondered this for a while, then he smiled and a nosee-um stuck<br/>
to his gums. <br/>
<br/>
Off to his right in the dark he could vaguely see a what could loosley<br/>
be termed a natural  walkway leading through the trees.  Dalliance<br/>
said it looked like the trees parted just for her and opened a path to<br/>
11.  Leave it to her to bring a little romance into it, probably<br/>
pretending to be Ingrid Bergman hiding from the Nazis.  Maybe she sat<br/>
on that stump waiting for Bogey.  Squinting he thought he could see a<br/>
better route up, if he retraced just a few steps.  So Big Slick left<br/>
the path, and walked straight up between the trees.  Knowing Dalliance<br/>
and the way her mind worked  7 &amp; 11 kept bouncing around in his mind.<br/>
 So he stopped when he thought he had taken 7 steps in what might be<br/>
Dalliance's stride.  It didn't look quite right, even in the growing<br/>
darkness, so he took four more and could see he had completly passed<br/>
between two clumps of trees that she said he needed to pass. <br/>
<br/>
She had said 7 &amp; 11 were her lucky numbers and was sorry this didn't<br/>
turn out this way too.  "Ooohkaaaay" he thought to himself, that makes<br/>
a lot of sense.  Trying to remember something else she said or did<br/>
when she babbled the instructions to him as she tore through the<br/>
kitchen in her haste to meet Johnny South Paw.  Yeah, he recalled, it<br/>
was really stupid.<br/>
<br/>
"Eight don't be late." <br/>
<br/>
Guess it wasn't 7 after all he laughed.  Something bit him through his<br/>
shirt, he slapped it hard, sure the itch would drive him insane<br/>
later.  <br/>
<br/>
Not much to see in the dark, turning around he could see the moon<br/>
reflecting off the lake. As he turned back something caught his eye to<br/>
his left.  There was just enough moonlight beyond the trees to see the<br/>
 silouette of a pine and note that something was funny about the shape<br/>
of it's trunk.  Then he heard something moving.  It didn't sound big<br/>
and he couldn't smell it, which was good at least it ruled out bears<br/>
and skunks, he hoped.  Just the same this whole thing was making him<br/>
jumpy and he wanted to get the Ace and be done with it.  So he counted<br/>
off the 8 steps keeping horizontal to the lake, and found his left<br/>
shoulder against a tree.<br/>
<br/>
On the forest floor hidden in the shadows was the remains of a tree on<br/>
the ground, worn smooth with age.   Slick's boot caught , he fell,<br/>
getting a mouth full of dried twigs, dirt and something soft, bitter<br/>
and moving.  Vigorously he spit this out as he stood and surveyed his<br/>
surroundings.  Well, that certainly took care of all the forest sounds<br/>
he thought let everyone know where I'm at too.<br/>
Hurriejdly he brushed himself off eleven more steps and I've got you<br/>
he thought as he looked at that funny bent pine.  So he went for it. <br/>
<br/>
"Where the forest gently begins, under a rock, by a mossy thin old<br/>
log, resting on the ground by a split trunk. Three of a kind will<br/>
always beat an ace"  Dalliance says.<br/>
