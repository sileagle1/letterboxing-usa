Having attended my first event this past weekend, I am wondering <br/>
about counting event stamps.  We had 1 stamp that was made <br/>
specifically for our event -- the official event stamp.  This one is <br/>
easy, it is counted as an "E".  In addition to this, there were a few <br/>
roaming "event" boxes/stamps/HH.  These I am not so certain how to <br/>
count.  Specifically I am referring to the K-Martha box, the <br/>
Letterboxing Nebraska visiting box and the Mark Twain visiting box.  <br/>
The K-Martha was not hidden, rather available in the stamp exchange <br/>
area.  The other two were hidden boxes.  Instinct tells me only to <br/>
count the official "carved for this event" stamp(s) as "E", and the <br/>
others as "F".  How do you seasoned event attendees do this?<br/>

Hi Deb,<br/>
<br/>
You are probably more seasoned than I, but I'll tell you how I count <br/>
mine.  If anyone out there wishes to correct my counting procedures, <br/>
I welcome them.<br/>
<br/>
Event Stamps:  If there is an Event Stamp for the Event, I count it <br/>
as an Event Stamp.  At one Event that I went to, the Roving Pacific <br/>
NW Event Stamp was there.  Since it was specifically marked "Roving <br/>
Pacific NW *Event* Stamp, I counted it as an Event Stamp.<br/>
<br/>
At Events:  If folks bring Hitchhikers along with them, and they are <br/>
specifically labeled "Hitchhikers", I count them as Hitchhikers.  If <br/>
folks bring a) hidden boxes for the Event (Thumbthing for Everybody <br/>
as an example), b) have Travelers with them (Bosun's Box and (I think)<br/>
Kiss Kiss are examples), or c) have a secret stamp on them that you <br/>
only get if you ask a specific question or whatnot (Alewife and <br/>
Matrioska (?sp) and Bad Joke Fairy are examples), I count them as <br/>
Finds.  KMartha showed up at an Event and I marked it as a Find.  All <br/>
others I count as eXchanges.  Boxes placed in the surrounding area <br/>
specifically for the Event that are either left there permanently or <br/>
retired after the Event, I count as Finds.<br/>
<br/>
Have I confused you?  I think I just confused myself. ;-)<br/>

A HH or event stamp count as a find. An exchange has to be someones personal stamp. I think we almost all agree on how to count planted boxes....Chuck and Molly<br/>

bit of a challenge, but Spring Chicks directions were right on and we<br/>
made it.  Actually, finding my way BACK to 96 was the bigger challenge,<br/>
but I didn't travel too far out of my way before realizing I'd messed<br/>
up..    But to me, that isn't what "finding" is all about.<br/>

I was leaning toward putting the 'traveling' event stamps in with the<br/>
event, but that seems misleading, too..  I've only been to 1 event, why<br/>
do I have 2 event stamps?  Maybe we need a new category?<br/>
