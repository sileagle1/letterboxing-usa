Pam , I don't think Lori intended to give you or anybody " the shaft "<br/>
she just thinks of you as a friend and would not want anything to <br/>
happen to you or anybody else . <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I hike alone 99.9% of the time.  It was a total pleasure to meet <br/>
other boxers at the Molly's Day Gathering this spring (including <br/>
Music Woman).  However, living where I do, when the mood seizes me to <br/>
fetch a box, I just head out on my own.  I spent 3 hours on a rainy <br/>
Sat. a few weekends ago at a preserve and never saw another human. <br/>
The fairly  recent discussion on what one carries when letterboxing <br/>
has prompted me to add a few things to my bag. One cannot live a full <br/>
life if cloaked in fear about what is around the next bend in the <br/>
trail or down that next alley. I'm vigilent..aren't all of us boxers? <br/>
And careful and appreciative of the beautiful sights, scents and <br/>
sounds of nature.  A book entitled The Gift of Fear has made me more <br/>
aware about paying attention to one's animal intuition about <br/>
potentially dangerous situations. I trust my instincts and relish my <br/>
freedom.<br/>
