Chambers Creek Park, Steilacoom, WA, Pierce County<br/>
by Nailhead of the Nail Family<br/>
Placed 3/30/03<br/>
<br/>
The Nail Family placed this box along the route between <br/>
dvn2rckr's 2 boxes at Chambers Creek Park in Steilacoom, WA.  <br/>
We did this to allow a third box in this very nice park that could be <br/>
had while looking for the other two.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Chambers Creek Park (copied from dvn2rckr's <br/>
clues)<br/>
<br/>
This is the direct route (I recommend the scenic route, <br/>
though): From southbound Interstate 5 south of Tacoma, take <br/>
Exit <br/>
129 (stay in the right-hand exit lane) and turn right (west) onto <br/>
South 74th Street. From Interstate 5 northbound, take Exit 129 <br/>
and <br/>
turn left on South 72nd Street (which soon becomes South 74th). <br/>
About a half mile after South 74th Street turns into Custer Road <br/>
West, turn right on Bridgeport Way West. Turn left on Chambers <br/>
Lane <br/>
West, which turns into Chambers Creek Road West. Across <br/>
from a <br/>
cemetery, turn left to follow Chambers Creek Road West down <br/>
into the <br/>
stream valley. After you cross the road over the bay, park on the <br/>
shoulder, and the trailhead is across the road. <br/>
<br/>
Scenic Route directions: From North or South Interstate 5, take <br/>
Exit 119 Steilacoom/DuPont. Head West over railroad tracks, <br/>
then <br/>
turn right on Steilacoom Highway. Take this road for about 6 <br/>
miles. You will drive through parts of North Fort Lewis that will <br/>
eventually take you through the quaint seaside village of <br/>
Steilacoom. Continue on the same road until you approach the <br/>
line <br/>
for the ferry, turn right on Lafayette Street and continue through <br/>
downtown Steilacoom until the road appears to leave the village <br/>
area. It will veer down toward Sunnyside Beach. Continue on the <br/>
same road past a large/closed recycling plant on the right side of <br/>
the road. About  mile from the recycling plant, you will notice <br/>
the Chambers Creek Fish trap on your left (the West side of the <br/>
road). There will be a large lake like area with a dam, fish <br/>
ladder, gravel parking area, picnic table and a sign that <br/>
describes <br/>
the various fish that spawn in the area. Park here or on the other <br/>
side of the street. Chambers Creek Park is pretty well hidden <br/>
from <br/>
traffic so keep your eyes posted for this. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL CROSSING THE ROAD HERE AS <br/>
CARS TRAVEL QUITE <br/>
QUICKLY ALONG THIS ROADalthough it's posted as 35 mph. <br/>
IT'S ALSO A <br/>
BLIND CORNER FOR VEHICLES COMING FROM THE NORTH <br/>
NEAR THE BRIDGE SO <br/>
BE EXTRA CAUTIOUS AS YOU CROSS THE STREET.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Difficulty- very easy <br/>
Terrain- easy with a short steep section of trail and some off trail <br/>
walking<br/>
Quality of Stamp- crude, carved on site while 2 tired and hungry <br/>
boys tried to distract their father<br/>
<br/>
To the Letterbox.<br/>
Since we were so impressed with this park after having found <br/>
dvn2rckr's Chambers Creek Letterboxes, we decided to place <br/>
another to encourage others to visit this beautiful area.  <br/>
<br/>
First locate the Chambers Creek Duck Letterbox ( find the clues <br/>
here:  http://www.letterboxing.org/wa/DVN2RCKR.htm#chambers  <br/>
) <br/>
