                    <div class="plaintext-content">Have you found a plastic square/rectangular mint/candy type container <br/>
that is waterproof?  I've tried the plastic Sucrets boxes, and <br/>
although a nice size, they are not waterproof.  Have also tried a few <br/>
different small plastic cosmetic containers, and have not yet found <br/>
anything waterproof.<br/>
<br/>
The tube M&amp;M containers are waterproof, but I would prefer square or <br/>
rectangular.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody had any luck?<br/>

&gt; We pretty much exclusivly do micro boxes now.   The container weve <br/>
been using <br/>
&gt; is basicly a pocket mint tin, thanks to advice from the mobots.   <br/>
Its small <br/>
&gt; and sturdy, and easy to hide.  As for books Ive been making them by <br/>
hand, and <br/>
&gt; using standard paper and wire(for necklaces) to bind it, but the <br/>
other day <br/>
&gt; while getting baggies at the craft store, I found like little <br/>
rivets (I think <br/>
&gt; used for scrapbooking), next book i make im gonna try these.<br/>

These have a wide neck `snap secure' or screw lid, come in a variety <br/>
of diameters and lengths. <br/>
Used for many applications, but most commonly seen in drug stores.<br/>
New plastic pill pots can be obtained from a number of manufacturers <br/>
such as Securitainers or Snapsecure but they do have a minimum order <br/>
quantity.<br/>
<br/>
I obtain used pots from my local Veterinarian (pill pots that would <br/>
otherwise be thrown away) and make a small donation to the animal <br/>
charity box.<br/>
<br/>
Always `double pot' to ensure that the log and stamp remain <br/>
completely dry ( just place the box into another pot the next size <br/>
up) <br/>
Happy micro boxing<br/>
