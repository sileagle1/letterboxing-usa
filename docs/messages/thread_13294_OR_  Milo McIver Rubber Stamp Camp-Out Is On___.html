<br/>
Thanks to a certain slab of bacon we all know and love we are set to<br/>
have our Portland area gathering at Milo McIver State Park in Estacada,<br/>
Oregon.  <br/>
<br/>
We've got Group Camp H2 and, per Funhog,  the name it's under is "Rubber<br/>
Stamp Camp Out".  We've got the group camp for Friday, July 11th from<br/>
4:00 pm that day to Sunday, July 13th at 1:00 pm, I believe.  This is a<br/>
tent area that can take 25 campers.  It ought to be lots of fun and even<br/>
though Ryan says that camping is overrated, I bet it will be just fine<br/>
and dandy for us all on that weekend. <br/>
<br/>
The camping facility is paid for.  Just bring yourr fine selves and all<br/>
the food and drink you can pack with you!  For those not camping there<br/>
is a Day Use Fee of, I believe $3.00.  Campers can just tell them at the<br/>
booth that they are part of the Rubber Stamp Camp Out at H2 and you<br/>
shouldn't have to pay to get in at all.<br/>
<br/>
So there's the latest. Please use a search engine to look up Oregon<br/>
State Park's website which has details about the park itself and<br/>
directions that will take you straight there.  This is going to be a<br/>
great time!!!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
