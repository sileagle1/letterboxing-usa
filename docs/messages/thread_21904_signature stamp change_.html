We have changed ours twice actually.  We debated for a long time <br/>
before changing from our original stamps, for just the same <br/>
reasons.  But we also wanted to go from individual store-bought <br/>
stamps to 1 handcarved family stamp.  The change has worked well for <br/>
us, and we changed again this year when our family grew to include <br/>
the new baby in the stamp.  We were still using the same names at <br/>
first, so most people didn't have any trouble recognising that it <br/>
was still us:-)  We know many people who have changed their stamps, <br/>
and few who have had any problems with it.  Just our 2 cents!<br/>

Nope, we still use the very first stamp I carved with a sharpened <br/>
letter opener. I have eliminated the original flower and replaced it <br/>
with a new one, but it still resembles the original. We of course have <br/>
added a "Hunter" stamp for me, a"Penguin" stamp for Gwen(Do you have a <br/>
pen Gwen?), and each dog has her own stamp. One of the coolest <br/>
functions that Ryan has at AQ is the ability to post your personal <br/>
stamp on your profile page, so if you would like to see a stamp carved <br/>
by a sharpened letter opener you can go to our page.<br/>
<br/>
Keli if you are reading this the Flower is a very big hint.<br/>

After a few weeks we decided upon a trail name and carved three <br/>
versions of our signature stamp, each a different size.  The largest <br/>
has been put into a letterbox and the other two we use on the trail.  <br/>
We never hesitated to change the original stamp.  The newer image <br/>

I had an ideal.  Something similar happened to me.  What if we started <br/>
a PLB to commemorate mistakes made when carving stamps.  And use the <br/>
messed up stamps as the box stamp.  What do you think?<br/>

carved after only a handful of boxes so that wasn't really a big <br/>
deal.  The second change was after the first 100 boxes -- in box <br/>
#100, I stamped both the old one and the new one.  I had intended to <br/>
do this at every 100 box milestone, but didn't keep up with the <br/>
numbers really well and found myself at box #200 while up in the <br/>
U.P. on vacation without a new stamp or proper carving stuff, so I <br/>
didn't make a change.  My trail name is on my stamp though so the <br/>
identity thing isn't such an issue.  I also have another stamp that <br/>
is very small which I use for micro-boxes (w/o trail name).<br/>
<br/>
I say if you're ready for a change -- change it.  It can be kind of <br/>
fun seeing people's different stamps from one box to another.  <br/>

Also, because there is a lot of repetition in PLBland, I switch up on that too - keeping the same one for rings, but using different stamps - especially some about to be planted - for random or one timer PLBs.<br/>
