                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's was a great letterboxing weekend for us.  We placed and found boxes<br/>
in Southwest Washington.  Two we placed Saturday at Ft. Canby State<br/>
Park, and today we were the first ones EVER to stamp into the new<br/>
LaCamas Lake letterbox placed by Der Mad Stamper recently.  Great clues,<br/>
but not the gimme I thought it would be.  Still...Mitch is a<br/>
Letterboxing Master and I just knew that box HAD to be there.  It was.<br/>
I just had to try to think like Mitch and finally we scored!  It is<br/>
doubtful I'll ever achieve the new Warrior Rock letterbox with its<br/>
cryptogram to drive me bonkers, but finding the one at LaCamas Lake was<br/>
certainly satisfying.  And what a beautiful day for it.  Great place for<br/>
a picnic and a hike, too I might add!  We were going to go kayaking on<br/>
the lake, but by the time  we finally achieved success with the box it<br/>
was getting chilly and the sun decided it was about time to go.  We're<br/>
looking forward to more.  P.S.  Thom -- place some easy ones, will ya,<br/>
guy!  Mitch is too cerebral for me.<br/>
