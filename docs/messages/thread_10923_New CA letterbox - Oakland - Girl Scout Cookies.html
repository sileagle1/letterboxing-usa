City:  Oakland<br/>
(Alameda County, CA)<br/>
<br/>
planted by PrincessLea and Audrey the Brownie on February 24, 2003<br/>
this is a "drive by" letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  880 freeway exit Hegenberger Ave.- proceed east on Hegenberger toward the Bay.  Take first right onto Edgewater and travel to 7700 Edgewater which is a business park.  Go to the second driveway for 7700 and you will see a shop run by the Girls Scouts of America.  Incidentally, this is a good place to buy merit badges for your backpacks.  Park in the lot.<br/>
<br/>
Across the street from the Girl Scout shop is a median strip - cross to it.  Standing on the grass, looking at the foliage you will see two low concrete benches.  The box is behind some of the ivy below the one on the right, sort of near the left footing.<br/>
<br/>
This is a trafficked area as you are in the middle of several business parks, but there is not much pedestrian action.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox was planted in honor of the annual sale of Girl Scout Cookies.  If you see a Girl Scout out selling cookies during February or March every year, please consider buying a box.  It?s the only time of year you can get them, and you are surely helping a good cause.  Thanks for your support, from every girl, everywhere!<br/>
