One thing that stubbornly stays traditional in letterboxing is this rich <br/>
history of mean spiritedness. Some letterboxers forget that there are actual <br/>
people on the recieving end of these bad manners. It seems that no matter how much <br/>
time, energy, and resources are put in to making letterboxing.org a place <br/>
where every common letterboxer can play for free, we're still considered <br/>
"elitist." But to show that even us old curmudgeons can learn a new trick, we have <br/>
posted a beta version of online logging for our boxes. Please see if you like them <br/>
more than the old fashioned, elitist ones at:<br/>

 I think too many forget that the letterboxing.org website is there for <br/>
them free for the taking, without doing anything in return for the many <br/>
hours put in by the webmasters keeping it going and the funds put in by <br/>
someone who shall remain anonymous (unless he/she wishes not to).<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't cost you a thing and is done out of the generosity of a <br/>
relative few who aren't trying to make a buck from you, in fact, spend <br/>
their own time and money to make it fun and free for you.<br/>
<br/>
Where else in this world will you find suchs gifts of a website giving <br/>
you clues to boxes created by someone who wants to share something with <br/>
you?<br/>
<br/>
I think it's great and I'm very grateful.  I even have a new <br/>
letterboxer in my town.  Granted, he's homeless and finds clues at the <br/>
library, but he really likes the game and is trying to get things <br/>
together so he can put out his own box.<br/>
<br/>
I think that's cool.<br/>
<br/>
And you're cool, too, Jay, as are all our webmasters and our anonymous <br/>
benefactor.  Waaay cool!  :o)<br/>
