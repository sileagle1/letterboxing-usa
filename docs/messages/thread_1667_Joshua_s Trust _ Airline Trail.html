&gt;Mark,<br/>
&gt;     I got my copy of the Joshua's Trust Walk book at the Denison Peqotsepos<br/>
&gt;Nature Center in Mystic.  I have also seen them at a store in Lebanon I<br/>
&gt;think it's called Lebonon Sports Center.<br/>
&gt;Where did you get the map for the Airline Trail?  I haven't had a chance to<br/>
&gt;find the boxes there yet, but it would be great to have a map when I do get<br/>
&gt;out there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Melissa (in chilly, will we have snow this weekend? CT)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sheesh, now I feel really stupid. I live about 5 minutes from the Lebanon <br/>
Sports Center. I live even closer to the Granny Austin's Tavern letterbox, <br/>
like 500 yards as the crow flies.<br/>
<br/>
I got the Airline Trail map from the Hebron Town Hall Recreation Dept, but <br/>
it was the last (or only) copy she had on hand. It sounded like she could <br/>
get more though. I've been told that both Colchester and East Hampton's <br/>
Parks and Rec Depts should have them too. I know that the lady who had them <br/>
made up is planning on updating it for next year too.<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking of trying to get the Lebanon Recreation Commission to <br/>
fund sprucing up the Lebanon section of the Airline Trail, from where they <br/>
left off at the Hebron line to Willimantic and see if Columbia wants to <br/>
help as it runs along the border. Then if Willimantic/Windham can fix their <br/>
portion, we would really have something grand.<br/>
<br/>
We've noted your first arrival at many of the letterboxes we've found this <br/>
past summer. Anxious to meet you all and others from this list in the <br/>
future. A happy new millennium to all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mark, of the 4-hearted Fittons <br/>
