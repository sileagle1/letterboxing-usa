<br/>
Directions:  Take Route 6 to Marconi Area and park in the lot. <br/>
Take the Atlantic White Cedar Swamp Trail, which starts from the <br/>
parking lot west of the Comfort Station building. Follow the trail to <br/>
the swamp and, where the boardwalk forks, go right if you're in a <br/>
hurry, left for a longer and more interesting walk. You might <br/>
reflect on the fact that, 30 years ago, this swamp was full of <br/>
water. It has been drying steadily over the years. When you exit <br/>
the swamp, go to the "walking man" sign that directs you to the <br/>
right, back to the parking lot. Instead, turn left and walk 12 paces <br/>
from the sign to a sand trail on the right. Walk 37 paces on the <br/>
trail to a double-trunked oak tree (be careful: it's not the first <br/>
double-trunked oak you pass) about 12 steps off the trail on your <br/>
left. Standing in front of the oak, take a bearing of 348 degrees <br/>
and walk about 32 steps to a double-trunked pitch pine. <br/>
Standing on the right side of the pitch pine, walk about 15 steps <br/>
due North to a very short stump. Cooks' Tour Letterbox is hidden <br/>
behind the stump, under a bunch of leaves and a rock.<br/>
Difficulty: A pleasant hike; requires a compass and knowing the <br/>
difference between a pace and a step.<br/>
