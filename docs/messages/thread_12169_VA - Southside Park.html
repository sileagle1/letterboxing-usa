Sunvalleysu with Dragonjake and Soccerjessie (their names will <br/>
probably change everytime we go out!) and DH in tow (to read the <br/>
clues) took a detour to Vienna on our way home to the Shenandoah <br/>
Valley from McLean.<br/>
<br/>
We decided to check out the Two-by-two series in Southside Park <br/>
placed by the Daughter of the Old Dominion.  All three boxes were in <br/>
great shape and may I say the clues were really well written.  There <br/>
were lots of trail checks to reassure you that you were on the right <br/>
track.  <br/>
<br/>
When hubby read the name of the third box as the "two left behind" <br/>
kiddies were so excited to see if they had guessed what the third <br/>
stamp would be...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a super way to spend a pretty spring afternoon DOOD!<br/>
