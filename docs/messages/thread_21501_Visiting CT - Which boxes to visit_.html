Hi, I will be visiting my parents in the New Haven area (they live in <br/>
Guilford, to be exact) starting next week through the end of the <br/>
month. I am looking for letterboxes that are accessible now (weather-<br/>
wise) and are under 2 hours hike in my area. Any suggestions? <br/>
<br/>
Also, are there any can't-miss boxes that I should know about - like <br/>
with a truly great stamp, a heavily-visited logbook, or just been <br/>
around since the beginning of time - within a two hour drive of my <br/>
area? I began to research this myself by looking on lbna, but with so <br/>
many letterboxes its overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!!  Thanks, Q<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
