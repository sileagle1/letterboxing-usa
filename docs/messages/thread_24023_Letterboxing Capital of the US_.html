I believe Mansfield, Connecticut is considered the "Letterboxing <br/>
Capitol of the U.S.".  I think some of their town brochures even make <br/>
this claim.  Perhaps someone from that area can confirm and see if <br/>
they still retain that title.<br/>

I am fairly new to letterboxing, but both myself and my family have <br/>
greatly enjoyed the scores of lbs hidden in our backyard, Stone <br/>
Mountain Park, Georgia. This has lead to my question, is there a <br/>
letterboxing capital of the US? Which one area has the most <br/>
letterboxes hidden in such a small space? <br/>
<br/>
I am the director of a non-profit agency in Stone Mountain Village, <br/>
Georgia and I would love to tout my area as the Letterboxing Capital. <br/>
Can anyone confirm or deny my hopeful claim?<br/>

with the entire metro Houston area, but we do have a whole lot of <br/>
letterboxes in a very small geographic area, so maybe I just need to <br/>
be creative with my marketing.  Also, I plan to place a bunch in the <br/>
Village to add to the count.  I'll message the board sometime early <br/>

Uh..... lol. I didn't mean it to be a negative thing. It's possible  <br/>
to promote the area as a good one for letterboxing without some sort  <br/>
of title. My guess is that most letterboxers would head to an area  <br/>
because they found boxes listed that they were interested in and it'd  <br/>
be the rare person who headed there because it had been given some  <br/>
sort of 'title'......<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you promote it in a general way, you put yourself right  <br/>
in the middle of the debate on that whole issue and risk exposing the  <br/>
boxes to muggles.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think you'd get a few arguements if you made such a claim. I <br/>
&gt; have no<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; idea how many boxes you have hidden in the park but the state of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Connecticut is the one spot usually recognized as having the <br/>
most<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes. The city of Portland, Oregon has hundreds,too. I'm so <br/>
glad<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you're pleased to host letterboxes in your park. Some <br/>
curmudgeonly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; park officials are not nearly as accommodating. Many thanks, <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've used both in my searches and so far all that I've looked for <br/>
have been there.  Again, I appreciate all of the comments and my <br/>
original posting was regarding a comparison of like geographical <br/>
areas.  As I said in a later email comparing this small area to a <br/>
state or metro-urban city would not be an accurate comparison.  <br/>
<br/>
Rather than use any sort of grandiose language about us, I think I <br/>
will just encourage all of you in your travels not to miss the <br/>
Village of Stone Mountain or the Park.  Both offer many opportunities <br/>
and the Village will be sprouting some new boxes soon.<br/>

Thank you again,<br/>

On Atlas Quest, at least, Houston ranks as the city with the most<br/>
letterboxes listed at 130 active letterboxes. Portland (OR) comes in<br/>
#2 with 113 active boxes. Stone Mountain checks in third with 89<br/>
active boxes. The rest of the top ten include: Rochester, NY;<br/>
Glastonbury, CT; Kingston, ON; Columbia, MO; Syracuse, NY; Avon, CT;<br/>

Of course, those are just boxes listed on AQ. <br/>

you will find Houston has many more.  Plus is you add in the Houston <br/>
Metro area (as many of us use the smaller township names just to <br/>
make it easier for people to find locations) you will find that <br/>
number will probably double.   From 10 boxes in the whole state 5 <br/>
years ago, I believe Houston and Texas have come a long way.  Come <br/>
