                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday Mingo, Wolfie, Pine cone and Pine Tree completed the Jumble Series. <br/>
while we were admiring the Wolf Den cave we saw a blue box out in the open.  <br/>
We opened it and it was planted by Lone Mass Wolf in 2001. Many people that we <br/>
have never seen before had signed in .  We tried to rehide the best we could. <br/>
So last night I looked for this box on the web site but could not find it . <br/>
Can any one help ????  Wolf Den Letterbox but not of the Jumble Series by the <br/>
way this was fun and challenging .we did find #22.....<br/>
