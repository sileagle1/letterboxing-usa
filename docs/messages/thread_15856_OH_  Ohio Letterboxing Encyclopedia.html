<br/>
I have been quite derailed from letterboxing of late.  <br/>
<br/>
I am about to close up much of the flyfisher-kayaks domain.  The Ohio<br/>
Encyclopedia is out on that server.<br/>
<br/>
No one has made a change or used it much since July.<br/>
<br/>
Any great objections to closing up the thing?  Anyone want the files<br/>
to put on a CGI server and modify the files to work there?  You will<br/>
need to know a little about cgi programming to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I'd especially like to hear from franzsolo, as I know he put a lot of<br/>
work into the encyclopedia in the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
If there is a great whoop and cry, I will spend the time to figure out<br/>
how to put it on my new and bigger server...  but it will probably<br/>
take me most of 3-4 hours to do so and I hate to make that committment<br/>
if no one cares.<br/>
<br/>

I thought the Encyclopedia  was helpful to get the groupings of all the<br/>
boxes in an area but I was helpless in adding the URL .<br/>
So now that the LbNa  can be modified I would mostly just use that to<br/>
get my new clues listed / revised. Thanks !<br/>

All is going well, however one thing led to another and I have been<br/>

<br/>
I'm doing hammock camping, the Appalachian Trail, sewing packs,<br/>
designing little wood burning stoves, and the like.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the new letterboxing site is handling what we needed in<br/>
the Cincy area back a year ago.  Unless I get a ton of responses to<br/>
the contrary, I will just dump the Ohio Encyclopedia.  <br/>

This was posted at just the right time for us!  Our family is <br/>
planning a short trip to Ohio soon with the sole purpose of <br/>
letterboxing. I was just wondering how to figure out which boxes we <br/>
should target when I saw this post.  I think we have decided to head <br/>
for John Bryan park.<br/>
