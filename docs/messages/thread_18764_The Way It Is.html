easily found in the FAQ or elsewhere. They may do this out of <br/>
laziness or ignorance (and here I mean to imply NO negative <br/>
connotation).<br/>
<br/>
For folks that are lazy, we should not reinforce their behavior by <br/>
directly answering the question. For folks that are ignorant, we <br/>
should educate/guide.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunatly there is no need to determine which crowd the question <br/>
asker is in as a proper response for both is simply to point the <br/>
person to the FAQ or google or wherever appropriate. <br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
Q: What is a hitchhiker?<br/>
A: The answer to that, and many other questions can be found in the <br/>
FAQ: http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html<br/>
<br/>
We must strive as a group to respond this way. Even one well meaning <br/>
person who directly answers such simple questions reinforces the <br/>
undesired behavior.<br/>
