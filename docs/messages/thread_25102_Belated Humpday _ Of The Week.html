This was back in '07 when Cyclonic &amp; I were boxing together a lot. One of us would say "hey, why don't we go box out in ......?" (State College, or New Jersey, or NYC, or wherever). And the other one would say "Yeah, sure--we could do that...." So Cy finds out that Schizokeet's going out to visit friends in San Francisco, and then she's going to this gathering in Sacramento....and next thing I know, I get a call: "Hey, you've got a week's vacation, why don't we go box out in California?" And I said, "Yeah, sure--we could do that...." =)<br/>
