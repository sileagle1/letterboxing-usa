My family and I (Rabbit's (Friends and) Relations) are making a trip <br/>
from Poughkeepsie to Cleveland, Ohio at the end of the month to attend <br/>
a function on Sunday.  We plan to go out on Friday (and that all day <br/>
drive with four kids won't be a picnic!) and are meeting old friends <br/>
from Ann Arbor in Cleveland.  I'd like some advice on a park we can <br/>
spend the day at on Saturday - picnic tables, playground, ideally a <br/>
letterbox or two... ?<br/>
Thanks in advance for any suggestions! (the kids range in age from <br/>
three to ten - our four are avid hikers, but our friends' are more the <br/>
ambling type...)<br/>

Nearby is "Weekend Getaway" - fits the bill?<br/>
