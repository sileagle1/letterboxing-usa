Just heard from Wanda last night that she found her 5000th box on top of <br/>
Tumbledown Mountain near Weld, one of her all-time favorite mountain hikes <br/>
in Maine!  She also choose that opportunity to plant two little gems, Beryl and <br/>
Garnet along the way, bringing us up to a total of 100 boxes planted.  <br/>
Wanda's been really busy lately.  She reached F4000 at the Laudholm <br/>
gathering in Wells, ME on March 16, PFX5000 in RI on May 10 and now <br/>
P100/F5000 on July 25, again up in Maine.  That's 1000 boxes found in just <br/>
the past four months, and 100 boxes in just the past four days (and not in CT <br/>
either :-)  )<br/>
<br/>
Now looking forward to her coming back down from the mountains so that we <br/>
can plan some trips together and get our clues updated.<br/>

Wanda's been really busy lately.  She reached F4000 at the Laudholm <br/>
gathering in Wells, ME on March 16, PFX5000 in RI on May 10 and now <br/>
P100/F5000 on July 25, again up in Maine.  That's 1000 boxes found in just <br/>
the past four months, and 100 boxes in just the past four days (and not in CT <br/>
either :-)  )<br/>
<br/>
Now looking forward to her coming back down from the mountains so that we <br/>
can plan some trips together and get our clues updated.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
