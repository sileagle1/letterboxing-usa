It is supposedly from Microsoft, alerting you to update your programs by running<br/>
the included attachment.<br/>
<br/>
Possible From: names are:<br/>
MS Security Services<br/>
Microsoft Program Security Division<br/>
Microsoft Corporation Security Section<br/>
<br/>
Subjects for this email could be:<br/>
Latest Internet Security Upgrade<br/>
Latest Net Critical Patch<br/>
Microsoft Security Update<br/>
<br/>
In some cases, the email looks very authentic, because they've used the format<br/>
of the Microsoft website.<br/>
It may even come from an email address that ends in @microsoft.com.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, never run programs that are attached to your email.  <br/>
Even if it's from your best friend, wife, husband, child, cousin, or dog, that<br/>
doesn't necesarily mean that<br/>
they actually sent it to you.  <br/>

Norton caught and quaranteened a couple of things from my mailbox <br/>
this morning. Then I found a note (supposedly from Microsoft) <br/>
announcing an attachment that wasn't there. I thought it was strange <br/>
that would forget an attachment, and went to the website to see what <br/>
new announcements there were and assured myself that all needed <br/>
updates were done.<br/>
Hooray for Norton.<br/>
