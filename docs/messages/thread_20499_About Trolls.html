<br/>
troll: (v.) (1) To deliberately post derogatory or inflammatory <br/>
comments to a community forum, chat room, newsgroup and/or a blog in <br/>
order to bait other users into responding.<br/>
<br/>
http://isp.webopedia.com/TERM/T/troll.html<br/>
<br/>
In any large public forum like this there are all kinds or people <br/>
and postings.  There are trolls, there are flame wars, there are <br/>
good people, not so good people, everything.  Welcome to politics.  <br/>
Some smaller groups manage to avoid this stuff but a large public <br/>
group is bound to experience it all.  <br/>
<br/>
The best response is to ignore/delete trolls and not fan any flames <br/>
with more attention.  What trolls and flamers want more than <br/>
anything is the attention.  Ignore them and they go bother someone <br/>
else.  <br/>

Quote from above link:<br/>
"Conclusion  <br/>
Next time you are on a message board and you see a post by somebody <br/>
whom you think is a troll, and you feel you must reply, simply write <br/>
a follow-up message entitled "Troll Alert" and type only this:<br/>
<br/>
The only way to deal with trolls is to limit your reaction to <br/>
reminding others not to respond to trolls.<br/>
<br/>
By posting such a message, you let the troll know that you know what <br/>
he is, and that you are not going to get dragged into his twisted <br/>
little hobby.<br/>
<br/>
The Internet is a splendidly haphazard collection of both serious <br/>
and silly material. Because it is so free, there are bound to be <br/>
problems. I think that we can best enjoy it if we deal with <br/>
everything that happens online with a wry grin and a ready shrug."<br/>
