                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, I concluded the paddling poll and I would say there was an <br/>
overwhelmingly positive response towards the idea of paddler friendly <br/>
boxes.  Now I just need to carve my first stamps and figure out where <br/>
to put some boxes at!  I have a few ideas such as Great Island in Old <br/>
Lyme, Selden Island, Powers Lake (East Lyme).  ALso considering Great <br/>
Swamp and possibly some of the smaller rivers in RI along Rt 138 that <br/>
are paddle-able in the spring time flows.  If anyone has ideas, feel <br/>
free to email me privately and I am open to sugestions. <br/>
<br/>
  I think the first thing will be letting mother nature warm up and <br/>
trying out some areas to check for safety and making sure the boxes <br/>
will stay put and not get flooded out! More to come in the following <br/>
months....<br/>

PS - I finally added up my totals and have in the area of P0, F26,X48 <br/>
and 4 virtuals (all 4 by COdybcleo!).  Shooting for 100 total this <br/>
spring. <br/>

are wonderful parents but if they are disturbed by anyone, including <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the reply and yes I am aware of it. Actually, I do have a <br/>
B.S. in Wildlife Biology and Management, with focus on Wetland <br/>
Wildlife Management..... so I am fairly "up" on that topic.   The <br/>
place to set the box would definately be out of that area and not in <br/>
the preserve.  The southern section is more open and I hunt it <br/>
regularly, so it would likely be down that way....<br/>
