Rayvenhaus has the same old sig stamp that TGD has also - perhaps that has changed, <br/>
but it is posted on his site along with his clans. TGD has since carved their own original <br/>
stamp. This is why it pays to CARVE YOUR OWN STAMPS....especially the signature stamp, <br/>
you wouldn't want millions of phytos running around - wait, there are millions of <br/>
phytos....oh, never mind!<br/>

Yup, I meant Rayvenhaus. Are you still lurking??! :D Anyway, my point was that TGD has <br/>
since re-carved, I had their new sig stamp a long time ago. It's better to carve your own <br/>
individual stamp than get lost in the muddle of commercially made dime-a-dozen stamps.<br/>

&gt; We all can't get along because every time someone who actually <br/>
cares <br/>
&gt; about the game makes a remark they are called an elitist and <br/>
deemed a <br/>

yet <br/>
&gt; seldom post anything. When they do post it is usually about <br/>
something <br/>

manner <br/>
&gt; and it is usually taken as being rude or condescending to the <br/>
newer <br/>

&gt; work in real life. If nobody says anything that isn't "nice" what <br/>
&gt; will that do but lead to stagnation. I've about given up on this <br/>
list <br/>
&gt; because I can't even make a joke about myself without causing <br/>

for <br/>
