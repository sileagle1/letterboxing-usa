area) black bear was hit yesterday on I-95 in North Stonington. They <br/>
said it was up over 100 pounds. <br/>
<br/>
I guess science prevailed as it was turned over to environmental <br/>
protection once the trooper figured out what it was. <br/>
<br/>
We used to get lots of calls from the Litchfield area when I worked <br/>
for the state. They seem to have a strong attraction to that nice <br/>
birdseed that we all like to put out. <br/>
<br/>
And now back to letterboxing....<br/>
