                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a very successful letterboxing weekend in Southern California, <br/>
not only did I plant another letterbox in my Other Canyons Series in <br/>
Eaton Canyon, but I found five other boxes:<br/>
<br/>
The "#2 stamp of the Strange Stamp Series" by Jam n Jelly. I finally<br/>
got back to this stamp, which was missing the first time I went for<br/>
the series. All three stamps are still in place.<br/>
<br/>
The "Easter Bunny Letterbox." My first ever Amanda from Seattle <br/>
stamp! This LB was also missing the first time I attempted it, but <br/>
Amanda has since re-planted and moved it to a new nearby location. As <br/>
Amanda mentioned in a post, the logbook was full, so I brought along <br/>
another logbook to leave in the box.<br/>
<br/>
"Warm Fuzzy," planted by AsianMary. Double-Saj and Old Blue were the<br/>
first stamps here 3 days before me. I didn't know they were in town.<br/>
<br/>
"The Hunt for the Borg Cube," planted by moderndulcinea. Interesting<br/>
hike into the fire-charred hills above the city of Claremont.<br/>
<br/>
"The Morbid Tour: The Jack Letterbox," planted by Q. This letterbox<br/>
is actually located in South Pasadena, not Los Angeles. This is an<br/>
easy grab for a fantastic stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Even with all the new additions, I'm starting to run outta<br/>
letterboxes down here. So I'm starting to make plans to revisit San<br/>
Luis Obispo and Kernville and have a letterbox orgy.<br/>

You've been busy!!! I planted four more to the Morbid Tour today, all <br/>
of which are in Los Angeles. I guess I could have just given South <br/>
Pasadena its own Morbid Tour, but I didn't want Jack to be lonely so <br/>
I just included him in the Los Angeles one. Anyway, hopefully these <br/>
will keep you from running out of boxes too soon :)  -Q<br/>
