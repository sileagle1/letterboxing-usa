                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday I thought I sent a help message to the archive but I do not <br/>
see it today.  I hope this works.  I have a letterbox which I removed <br/>
from the woods, I need to get it off the list of clues.  I have read <br/>
all the info on letterboxing.org but I just can't seem to figure it <br/>
out.  Also I want to edit some other clues in my other letterboxes <br/>
and I do not know how to do that either.  I would appreciate any help.<br/>

the names of your letterboxes and hit "delete" under the name of the box.  Then <br/>
follow the directions (can't tell you definitively how to do this since I've <br/>
never deleted a box before!).<br/>
