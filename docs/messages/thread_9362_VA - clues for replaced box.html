Hi Mary!  Nice new website!  We are looking forward to finding the new box <br/>
#2.  We are famliar with this park and SHOULDN'T get lost, though you never <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
We need to get back in the saddle again.  I'm bummed to find out that we <br/>
must have just failed to find the first Froggy (and the third).  We looked <br/>
all over that path and under all of the single trees it could have been. We <br/>
even found a big pile of sticks (most of the ground is just pine needles) <br/>
but no box.  Did you all locate this one?  You are good at giving hints.  <br/>
Thanks!  BeMa<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Last month, Box 2 of the In the Park series went missing.  It's been<br/>
&gt;replaced.  It's in the same park, but with a new location, new clues,<br/>
&gt;and a variation of the original stamp.  I'm counting it as a new plant<br/>
&gt;so those of you who found the original box, can count this<br/>
&gt;replacement as a new find.<br/>
