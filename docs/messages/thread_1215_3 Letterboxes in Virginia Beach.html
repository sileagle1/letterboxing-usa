of the Ocean and the Bay.<br/>
<br/>
Fort Story, located on Cape Henry next to Virginia Beach, is off US <br/>
60.  An active military installation, open to the public, offers <br/>
visitors sandy beaches and lots of history.  The Old Cape Henry <br/>
lighthouse holds it place next to the Fort Story Lighthouse.  Spend <br/>
some time on O'Keefe's Lookout, looking out over the Atlantic.  A <br/>
short walk over to the Cape Henry monuments will bring you closer to <br/>
this letterbox.  Check out the stone map depicting the French/British <br/>
engagement off the Virginia Capes on September 5, 1781, and the cross <br/>
monument to the English colonists whose First Landing was at this <br/>
site on April 26, 1607.<br/>
<br/>
The Fort Story Lighthouse Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
On the grassy knoll of monuments, you'll encounter Admiral Francois <br/>
Joseph Paul de Grasse.  With the sun at your back, facing the <br/>
Admiral, your prize is below the wooden path at the shadow's head.  <br/>
If there's no sun to guide you, 10 paces behind the statue will lead <br/>
you to the spot.  A post to your right keeps this box hidden.<br/>
<br/>
Stamp in, enjoy more of the great views at Fort Story, and head down <br/>
the road a piece to First Landing State Park.<br/>
<br/>
First Landing State Park is a short drive from Fort Story on US 60 <br/>
heading back to Virginia Beach.  A right turn on 64th Street leads <br/>
you to the entrance.  Once through the contact station ($3 parking <br/>
fee), park in the first Wayside Parking area.  I chose the Long Creek <br/>
Trail and the Osprey Trail Circuit.  I chose to begin the Long Creek <br/>
Trail at it's midpoint to join with the Osprey Trail for a 4 mile <br/>
hike.  To access the Long Creek Trail for this segment, hike down the <br/>
paved road approximately one mile, which on most days is a more <br/>
pleasant walk, as the access from the Cape Henry trail is very <br/>
crowded with hikers and bikers.  Randy Johnson's "Hiking Virginia" <br/>
describes the Long Creek and Osprey trails as the less crowded trails <br/>
in the park, and both lived up to this description.  <br/>
<br/>
Box #1 - Long Creek Seahorse<br/>
<br/>
Your reward comes early on the Long Creek Trail.  But, don't let that <br/>
stop you from cotinuing on for #2, or you'll miss a wonderfully <br/>
peaceful and scenic trail.  Enter the trail from the paved road <br/>
through a fence barrier to begin the orange blazed trail.  Just 12 <br/>
strides down the trail, look to the left.  You'll see a fallen tree <br/>
which has formed a natural shelf.  Tucked under the shelf is the Long <br/>
Creek Seahorse.  Stamp in and continue your walk to where the Osprey <br/>
Trail connects.<br/>
<br/>
Box #2 - Broad Bay Shells<br/>
<br/>
Walking along the peaceful Osprey Trail, you'll hear the toads <br/>
popping in and out of the creeks that line both sides of the path.  <br/>
As the Broad Bay first becomes visible on your left, leave the trail <br/>
for an easy scramble on the right hand side of the trail.  You'll see <br/>
a tangle of fallen trees.  At the base of a tall pine still standing, <br/>
dig through the twigs and branches to find the Broad Bay Shells.  <br/>
After stamping in, tuck the box in as deeply as possible and rehide <br/>
with the branches and twigs.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on, as the best of this trail is yet to come.  A short <br/>
distance up the trail on the left is a sandy path.  Take that path <br/>
and what you'll find is a narrow strip of secluded sandy beach where <br/>
you can rest on the shore and listen to the water lap onto the sand.  <br/>
If you're prepared with your swimsuits, it's a great spot for a swim <br/>
or even just to cool your feet or pick up a few shells to take home.<br/>
<br/>
I continued on the Osprey trail as far as I could, but found a bridge <br/>
washed out and could not continue to loop back onto the Long Creek <br/>
Trail and had to double back the way I came to reconnect with the <br/>
Long Creek Trail.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck and happy hiking!<br/>
