Covered Bridge Letterbox Clues<br/>
Planted on July 12, 2001<br/>
State:  Maine<br/>
County:  Oxford<br/>
Town:  Bethel<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is located near the beautiful village of <br/>
Bethel, Maine.  We are nestled in the Western Mountains, near <br/>
the White Mountain National Forest.  There are tons of <br/>
opportunities for hiking, biking, canoeing, kayaking and the like, <br/>
in case your letterboxing takes you far enough away from home <br/>
to want to stay the night.  There are inns, motels, bed and <br/>
breakfasts and camping areas to stay at as well as several <br/>
eateries.  We are going to plant more letterboxes in this area, so <br/>
please stay posted!<br/>
<br/>

Your first job is to find your way to Bethel, Maine.  <br/>

&gt; Covered Bridge Letterbox<br/>
&gt; Your first job is to find your way to Bethel, Maine.<br/>
&gt; From Bethel, find your way to Route 2 East.  About four miles<br/>
&gt; from Bethel, take a left onto the Sunday River Road.  Drive<br/>
&gt; "straight" for about two miles.  Bear right at the fork.  The left<br/>
&gt; will take you to the Sunday River Ski Area, so don't take that<br/>
&gt; road (at least for the letterboxing adventure).  Go about one mile<br/>
&gt; and you will come to another fork.  Keep bearing right to the<br/>
&gt; Covered Bridge (a sign will point that out).  A little less than a<br/>
&gt; mile from that point, you will come upon the Covered Bridge,<br/>
&gt; which will be on your left.  Park your car on either side of it.<br/>
&gt; Take the footpath that is on the left side of the Covered<br/>
&gt; Bridge.  Walk a ways, keeping the Sunday River on your right.<br/>
&gt; After a bit of a walk, the river makes a sharp bend.  Stop here<br/>
&gt; long enough to take in the beautiful view of the mountains in the<br/>
&gt; distance.  Continue on your quest.  The path takes a sharp curve<br/>
&gt; to the right.  After a bit more walking, you will notice two trees,<br/>
&gt; one on either side of the path, that have orange surveying marks<br/>
&gt; painted on them.  Continue on until you come to a sign that says<br/>
&gt; "Camp Ella."  You will see the camp ahead of you.  At the<br/>
&gt; location of the sign, take the path to the left up the hill.  At the<br/>
&gt; crest of the hill, look to your right and you will see a huge<br/>
&gt; boulder that's about fifteen adult paces off the path.  At the base<br/>
&gt; of the boulder you will find your treasure.  :-)<br/>
