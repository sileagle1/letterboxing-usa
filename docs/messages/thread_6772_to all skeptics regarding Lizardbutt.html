&gt;   As stated before in one of my previous posts Lizardbutt is real and<br/>
&gt; is truly 5 years old.  A new 5 yr. old. He is a very bright, high<br/>
&gt; energized, spirited child.  Some of the things he says makes me think<br/>
&gt; twice.  It just comes naturally for him.  Of course it's his Mom or<br/>
&gt; older sister that is doing all the typing. Duh!!! As you can see<br/>

Hello Letterboxers!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Meet my dog Hump-n-BumpButts. I take her letterboxing with me. She told me<br/>
she loves it and if she had hands she would carve a stamp. Here she wants to<br/>
type you a message now!<br/>

Oh, isn't that cute!  Hump-n-BumpButts's paws are too big. Looks like I will<br/>
have to type for her! Hump-n-BumpButts says<br/>
<br/>
"I loves to letterbox. I gets to run free when nobodys is looking and chase<br/>
small creatures. I gets to smell all kinds of different and interesting<br/>
things. BadgerButt-Dad is lots of fun, except when Hump-n-BumpButts<br/>
Hump-n-Bumps BadgerButt-Dad's leg when he is trying to stamp in the book.<br/>
What really gets to BadgerButt Dad is I am a bitch (that is dog talk for a<br/>
female not the bad word DadButt calls MomButt) yet I love to Hump-n-Bump<br/>
legs. Us silly dogs! We don't care!"<br/>
<br/>
That is all for now. I love this hobby and Hump-n-BumpButts says next time<br/>
she will discuss why Christians are the true Evil in the world, fun<br/>
children's games to play with Catholic Priests and the reason God is truly<br/>
the opiate of the masses. Hump-n-BumpButts says:<br/>
<br/>
"I should know! Dog is God spelled backwards!"<br/>
<br/>
Isn't Hump-n-BumpButts just so cute!!!!<br/>
<br/>
It is so nice not to be bridled by subject content anymore! I love to live<br/>
and to share everything!<br/>

BabyButt (he is an old 3 years old and we will post his thoughts soon! He<br/>
can type but he cut his two typing fingers performing brain surgery.)<br/>
