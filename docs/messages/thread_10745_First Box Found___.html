We found our first box this weekend and LOVED IT! "Sorry dear, won't <br/>
be able to fix the roof, got a letterboxing roadtrip planned! We <br/>
always wanted an indoor pool anyhow!"<br/>
<br/>
Dragged the kids from in front of the tv, packed up the dog and wife, <br/>
and took off to Saluda Shoals Park. Found the one there easily and <br/>
spent a couple of hours exploring the park. We decided to get <br/>
adventurous and head out to Harbison Forest in search of Ladybug's <br/>
boxes. Found the first and then spent another hour or so wading <br/>
through the mud trying to find the second. Had to leave without it <br/>
due to the gate closing, but we'll be back! The kids had a blast and <br/>
it only took an hour or so to clean the mud out of the wife's car!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ahh,  the captivating power that finding a 'first' box has.  We are <br/>
like fish that swallow the bait - hook, line and sinker!  Initially <br/>
we are caught unawares, casually musing about when and where we might <br/>
go to look for our first letterbox.  Even after the first bite, we <br/>
think we are free to come and go as we please.  But beware! Before <br/>
long, each unplanned weekend, day or even hour becomes prey to plans <br/>
for letterboxing hikes.  An excursion to visit Mom or Dad becomes <br/>
another quest and looses it's original purpose (If I just make this <br/>
one little detour, I'll still have 1/2 an hour left to visit my <br/>
folks). Finally, on one fine day while driving to work, we suddenly <br/>
find ourselves in a beautiful but remote wooded area, eternally <br/>
trapped in the clutches of letterboxing.<br/>
Enjoy your captivity!<br/>
