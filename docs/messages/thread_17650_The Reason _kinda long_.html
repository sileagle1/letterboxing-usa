                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know, I'd rather forgotten one of the points of all this:  Admiring a well-crafted stamp.  Let me explain...<br/>
<br/>
    I'd been gathering the impression (mostly unfounded) that there's some folks that are only interested in "getting their numbers up" - that is, power-walking through areas, ignoring the rgeat places, to get as many finds in an hour as possible just for the bragging rights of a big F#.  I thought it'd be a shame to dis' such appreciation of what others have put together for our enjoyment.  I had similar thoughts about the hitchhiker "feeding frenzy" described in a previous posting.  Just another way to "get my numbers up".<br/>
    That whole line of thinking totally ignores a few things.  Firstly, some people enjoy the thrill of the hunt.  The object is almost irrelevant to the speedy conclusion of the puzzle, thus giving the same feel as one who can finish a crossword puzzle before others - it's just a goal that some folks enjoy.  Whether it's my cup of tea or not is irrelevant!<br/>
    Secondly, some folks only get a small amount of free time.  Goodness knows I've had my letterboxing time cut short by Uncle Sam having the nerve to keep scheduling Reserve drills (the nerve!).  They collect stamps and appreciate them at home when they can.<br/>
    Thirdly, the areas described are often old terrain for many letterboxers.  If Schmedley Park has thirty letterboxes in it, and you've been there twenty-eight times, then the glamour has probably worn a bit thin.<br/>
    Then in re: the hithhikers at gatherings, well, I still would avoid those.<br/>
<br/>
BUT!  After seeing the LOVELY crafting of Mad Mary's Bass (in the 'Just Bass' LB), I'm all in favor of collecting impressions of as many stamps as possible out of the sheer appreciation of the artwork.  I may not count a hitchhiker from an event pile on a table as a real Find (until I really Find it), but I'd sure like to take an impression to show my family and friends!  They get as much of a kick out of them as I do, and some of my family can't get outdoors.<br/>
    So I'm going to be kinder of thought in the future.  I'll happily accept that others' strange ways are their way of enjoying a game with no rules, anyway.  And I'm going to enjoy the fruits of others' labors, try to emulate them, and thank them for the wonderful places they lead me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, guys!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for sharing those words Dave, I really appreciate hearing that<br/>
someone else feels as I do.  Yes, I post my PFX count, but that's not why we<br/>
do this hobby.  And our reasons for doing this are way different that yours<br/>
or anyone else's, but, the basis is the same as what you just said... I love<br/>
seeing places others have found and I love seeing their stamps.  I consider<br/>
myself to be on the low end of the carving ability and certainly not an<br/>
artist at all, I can barely hold a pencil, let alone draw and create<br/>
something from a blank piece of paper. My abilities in creating things<br/>
laying with the wood I work with, the clocks and other items I make.  Even<br/>
the stained glass RayvenMom and I do comes from a pattern.  But to see some<br/>
of the images that others make... To have the pleasure of seeing a stamp<br/>
hand carved by ScoutDogs or by Chuck and Molly (As we did when they sent<br/>
boxes down here for Fright Fest '03) or, more often, to see the stamps of<br/>
the wonderful carvers we have in this area is such a treat.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for sharing your thoughts, they were greatly appericated<br/>
this early sunday morning.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I totally agree. Living in Georgia, I knew a long time ago that I would <br/>
never be in the big leagues as far as PFX numbers go, unless I <br/>
travelled around the country. Since that's not possible, I decided to <br/>
simply accept the limitations on the number of boxes available and to <br/>
create the best stamp images I could. Like others, I wasn't the world's <br/>
best stamp carver naturally, so I had to work on it. But I was <br/>
determined to "upgrade" the artistry level of the stamps I planted. I <br/>
figured that if, again here in GA, you would only get maybe 2 boxes a <br/>
month (b/c you don't want to exhaust the entire state too quickly), <br/>
they better be worth it. Each stamp I carve for a letterbox gets better <br/>
and better. I would rather have one great stamp than 20 so-so stamps. <br/>
Quality, to me at least, is better than quantity.<br/>

Dear Dave,<br/>
<br/>
This is the reason why I am so anxious to "adopt" those so very <br/>
special boxes when the original placer has either gone on to bigger <br/>
and better things, or is too busy to keep up with their boxes (as is <br/>
the case with Mary - future plumber to be!).<br/>
<br/>
I have the pleasure of being the maintainer of both of her boxes <br/>
(Just Bass and Point Judith).  I have had to replace the container, <br/>
the log book, the ink pads, just about everything on Point Judith <br/>
about four times in the last year.<br/>
<br/>
And, as you know, how can you *not* stop at Just Bass?  The location <br/>
is absolutely spectacular and the image stamp is beyond compare.<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad that you enjoyed this box.<br/>
<br/>
And I agree with your philosophy.  At the upcoming New England Event, <br/>
I am deliberately hosting a hitchhiker hostel so that all the <br/>
hitchhikers that are brought are not all over the table.  You bring <br/>
one, you get to take one - no stamping frenzy.<br/>
<br/>
And I now have a very *very* special personal traveler that I carry - <br/>
a hand carved gift from Funhog.  And who will get the image of this <br/>
stamp?  Those folks that *truly* appreciate hand carving, not just <br/>
someone who wants to up their X count.  My signature stamp will have <br/>
to do.<br/>
