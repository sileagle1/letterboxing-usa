    This is Susan Davis, one of the Webmasters.   I wanted to reassure<br/>
you that the Webmasters DO NOT advertise offers of any kind.  I suggest<br/>
that you immediately delete anything that says reply to:<br/>
letterboxing-usa@yahoogroups.com if it contains anything that isn't<br/>
obviously relevant to letterboxing.  We all need to be watchful<br/>
regarding worms and unsolicited email (we all get enough of the<br/>
"questionable" type already).  I always empty my recycle bin right away<br/>
as well.<br/>

Are the settings for the LbNA list such that one must be a member of the<br/>
list in order to post?  While I understand that it might not be set as such<br/>
so that non-list members can post letterboxing clues to the list, it is that<br/>
setting above all else that keeps this kind of junk mail out of my many<br/>
other mailing lists.  I wonder if that setting would be a possibility...then<br/>
anyone sending unsolicted mail of that type could be unsubscribed by the<br/>

Randy Hall is the owner of this list, which is not actually a formal part of<br/>
LbNA, but serves all letterboxing interests. Randy has mentioned several<br/>
times the possibility of making this a 'members only can post' list. There<br/>
are pros and cons. He would possibly be willing to try it if a majority of<br/>
the list members voted in favor.<br/>

Good idea IMHO. Perhaps we should also address the attachments issue <br/>
in a poll while we are on the subject. I personally see no problem <br/>
with a members only list and it will cut the spam. Very few spammers <br/>
will bother to join a list, they only use targets that require very <br/>
little effort on their part. Anyone casually interested in <br/>
letterboxing can still read the messages on the yahoo site but would <br/>
have to be inspired enough to join the list to post to it.<br/>

I finally got a little pad to go with your HH Time Machine and placed them<br/>
in the Mercy Brown Vampire box.  Sorry it took a while. My LB partner<br/>
loathes hot weather.  Any more boxes in PVD to report? She hates hot weather<br/>
but she loves the city and any box that is practically a drive-by.<br/>
