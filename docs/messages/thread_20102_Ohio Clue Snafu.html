                    <div class="plaintext-content">Alright, I'll bite on this issue of someone<br/>
retaliating against another boxer because of a clue<br/>
snafu.....I can see both sides of this issue....<br/>
<br/>
....as I ALSO spent a lot of time looking for<br/>
"Miniature Golf". I ALSO went through the bushes,<br/>
through the poisonous plants, etc. It is not the<br/>
PLACER'S fault that I printed the clues as soon as<br/>
they came out and failed to look for updates. It is<br/>
not the PLACER'S fault if you encounter poison ivy,<br/>
hillbillies, snakes, aliens or any thing else that may<br/>
bring you harm. Why? BECAUSE WE BOX AT OUR OWN RISK!<br/>
The very idea of someone taking their anger out on<br/>
innocents (who are not even involved) and ruin their<br/>
boxes...is just unfathomable and poor sportsmanship.<br/>
<br/>
You will never find 100% of the boxes you look for. It<br/>
is part of the game. When we couldn't find "Mini<br/>
Golf", we packed up and moved on to the next box. It's<br/>
nothing to get angry over. This happens all the time.<br/>
Would it have been any different if some bratty<br/>
children decided to take the box and throw it in the<br/>
lake...and then you couldn't find it? NO. Because it<br/>
happens all the time. I know you (the person<br/>
threatening retaliation) are on this list, and I know<br/>
you're "smart" enough to understand this. It's time to<br/>
let bygones be bygones and start looking for your next<br/>
box....<br/>
