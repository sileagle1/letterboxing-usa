<br/>
Pandora carved a series of boxes devoted to Peter Pan. The first one <br/>
of the series was Tink's Wand. It was quickly lost (sigh). Pandy left <br/>
the area and left me in charge of the rest of the plants.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I am placing the boxes with the aid of other Googled members. <br/>
The first one of the new plantings is Peter's Shadow. <br/>
<br/>
These are very high quality carves and I think well worth hunting. My <br/>
goal in planting them is to 1) associate the stamp with some physical <br/>
location around the Central California area, and 2) make the boxes <br/>
accessible for folks with smallish children or trouble walking. I am <br/>
not encrypting the first clues but may make some of them harder as <br/>
the mood strikes me. *GRIN*<br/>
<br/>
I hope to have the whole series out and ready for our October 4th <br/>
Letterboxing Get-together. <br/>
<br/>
Would appreciate feedback as you look for them,<br/>
Sir Balthazar<br/>
