                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello there, <br/>
as most of you in the Pacific Northwest already know--Schmitz Park #3 <br/>
seems to always be missing.  I have moved the box to a better <br/>
location.  The stamp has remained the same, so if you already have <br/>
it, no need to go back a second time. <br/>
<br/>
Here are the revised clues.  The only change is for #3.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Schmitz Park,  Seattle, Washington<br/>
Directions:  From I-5 take the West Seattle Bridge to SW Admiral <br/>
Way.  Follow Admiral Way uphill, through the business district, and <br/>
downhill to SW Stevens (watch for the "rainbow" park sign on the <br/>
left, just before Admiral Way crosses a bridge over the ravine). Turn <br/>
left at the sign and keep right, following the road down to the <br/>
parking area.  Park in the parking lot.Difficulty:  easy<br/>
Clues:  From the parking lot, start at the sign that says "Leash Pets <br/>
and Obey Scoop Laws".<br/>
Take the main path to the right past a rock commemorating the <br/>
bicentennial planting of fir trees.<br/>
You'll come to a fork in the path, take the right fork upwards.   <br/>
Further along the trail, there will be a small wooden bridge to your <br/>
left.  Take the bridge and at the second section of bridge, there <br/>
will be on your left a tree with fallen trees on either side of it.  <br/>
You can step off the bridge onto one of these fallen trees.  At the <br/>
base of the standing tree, within the roots is the letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now for Schmitz Squirrel (#2):<br/>
<br/>
Get back on the 2nd Bridge and continue to a 3rd Bridge, a 4th Bridge <br/>
(with railings), a 5th Bridge!! and finally a small concrete bridge <br/>
(#6) After crossing the concrete bridge, you will be in a small <br/>
clearing.  Directly ahead of you is a large Cedar Tree.<br/>
In the back of the tree at its base is another cubby hole with the <br/>
2nd letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
For Schmitz Creek Letterbox (#3):<br/>
<br/>
Continue on the path just to the right of the Large Cedar <br/>
Tree...(remember, the cedar tree is in front of you)<br/>
When this path forks, take the left fork.<br/>
Just ahead is a Large Stump take approximately 14 steps past the <br/>
stump and you will be at the end of a large log (on your left) that <br/>
is parallel to the path.  Underneath the end of this log<br/>
is your 3rd Letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
Hurrah!  Just follow this path back to the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
You can continue to Enjoy your day in Seattle by driving down Admiral <br/>
Way to Alki Point.  The Beach there is lovely (views of the Olympics <br/>
and Downtown Seattle) and there are lots of places to eat.<br/>
