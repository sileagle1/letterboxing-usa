I just noticed your addition to Marty's Letterbox Ring this afternoon <br/>
- the Letterbox Series site. Did you announce this while I was <br/>
sleeping, or did you modestly let this go by unheralded? It is a <br/>
spectacular addition!!!!!!! The two series you have started with are <br/>
great choices, and I am sure we will all come up with many more.<br/>
<br/>
Beautifully conceived, beautifully executed.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

Thanks.  I guess I figured it didn't need a separate e-mail to announce<br/>
it, that people would find it eventually.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to group letterboxes by different people into series that<br/>
have a common thread, and then people may want to collect the series.<br/>
Its sort of another dimension on the idea of collecting all the stamps<br/>
of a particular artist (do we call someone who hides boxes an "artist"<br/>
or a "hider", or is there some cool Dartmoor term for this, or should we<br/>
make one up?).  In any case, it is sort of an unplanned thing, but if<br/>
people want to work on creating a series I'll put it on the page when it<br/>
has a few boxes in it (this idea is also sort of different than individual<br/>
series that people have done, but if people want me to put individual<br/>
series on it mabye I will).<br/>
<br/>
The two series now are "first in each state", (since the Smithsonian<br/>
article anyway), and "those on the Appalachian Trail" (a series I have<br/>
completed, for now anyway :-)).  You can find the page at<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/series.html or through the webring if you<br/>
want.<br/>

<br/>
Sheila (Bob Woodruff Park box) and I  had a conversation about this not too<br/>
long ago...which box was first in Texas?...and we concluded that it was<br/>
actually the first one in the Duck Creek series in Garland.  I had thought<br/>
that it was hers and said so on the list, but she corrected me!  (Sadly it<br/>
was one of the 3 that went missing earlier this year.)<br/>

<br/>
p.s.  I really like your idea to list boxes this way--it's very interesting<br/>
and easy to read.<br/>

Randy,<br/>
I also think your new page is a great addition to the webring!!<br/>
<br/>
I was contemplating how the series that individuals have done would fit into <br/>
this scenario, but decided that most of the individual series boxes are <br/>
already linked together on the clue pages, so there's no need to add them to <br/>
your page.<br/>
<br/>
You spoke of inventing a word for letterboxing artists/placers... maybe there <br/>
should be a special term for the sorts of cross-continent series that your <br/>
page is devoted to (besides the word SERIES, which Dartmoorians seem to like <br/>
to use for the individual variety).  Chain?  Train?  String?  This seems to <br/>
be something new that doesn't really apply to UK letterboxing, which is <br/>
mostly confined to Dartmoor.<br/>

I agree with Tom - its a great way to fold  together boxes by different<br/>
individuals that have a common location. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps sometime along, there could be a Long Trail Series, (VT's, which<br/>
preceed the Ap. Long Trail!) There will soon be half a dozen boxes in<br/>
this series! And, I'd like to suggest a Lake Champlain (a really GREAT<br/>
lake!), after I get a few more (now 3) out this summer.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, things just keep getting better!<br/>
