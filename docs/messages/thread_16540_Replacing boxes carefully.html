includes zipping up all ziploc baggies and making sure the box seals.<br/>
<br/>
We had a gully-washer a couple of weeks ago.  When we went to check on our boxes, <br/>
we found that one (out of the water's way) had been left open.  It was not harmed, but <br/>
another in the same series was scattered in little pieces all up and down the <br/>
creekside.  We recovered most of it, but the stamp seems to be gone for good :(  <br/>
Everything that was inside a sealed bag survived just fine, but unfortunately most of it <br/>
seems not to have been in a sealed bag.<br/>
<br/>
Another box at a different location washed downstream, but was still intact since it <br/>
was sealed well.<br/>
<br/>
So, finders, please take care to pack everything up well after stamping in.<br/>
