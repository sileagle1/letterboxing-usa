                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is one of my pet peeves, so I have to add my own two cents on the <br/>
issue of cleaning stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, of course you should *always* clean the ink off a stamp before you <br/>
replace it in a letterbox. But NOT with a baby wipe....<br/>
<br/>
The most significant risk to the longevity of a letterbox in the wild <br/>
(IMHO) does not come from intentional vandals, or careless, sloppy <br/>
letterboxers (though they may be from closely related genuses and we can <br/>
only hope that they'll breed themselves out into extinction sooner rather <br/>
than later), but from nature itself. Letterboxes have been destroyed by <br/>
rain, snow, ice, flooding, fire, falling trees, rockslides, humorless parks <br/>
officials (and so on). Most letterboxers are conscious of doing what we can <br/>
to protect our letterboxes from these hazards, by packing them in <br/>
watertight containers, avoiding hollows in rotting trees, not planting <br/>
boxes streamside when water levels are low, avoiding national parks, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But the single biggest risk comes from the critters that live in the great <br/>
outdoors. Racoons, bears, otters, mice, squirrels, chipmunks and other <br/>
four-legged varmints spend their days foraging through forests and parks, <br/>
sniffing out interesting smells and potential food sources. With their <br/>
extra-sensitive noses, they can find a letterbox with no trouble at all -- <br/>
and then chew through it or get the lid off without any problem at all. <br/>
(Over the winter, squirrels chewed holes in the lid of my Rubbermaid <br/>
Toughneck 30-gallon trash can, so some puny plastic letterbox container is <br/>
no problem for them. Bears have made off with my trash cans twice now, too.)<br/>
<br/>
These critters don't read clues to find letterboxes, and they don't find <br/>
them by sight -- they find them by smell. Anyone who camps in bear country <br/>
knows about bear bags -- putting all of your food and scented items <br/>
(including deodorant, detergent, hand lotion, soap) in a duffel bag, and <br/>
then hoisting the bag 15 or 20 feet into the air using ropes strung over a <br/>
tree branches at some distance from your campsite. The idea is not only to <br/>
protect your food from the bears, but to keep the bears from getting <br/>
curious about interesting smells in and around your tent.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, letterboxers should be careful to keep letterboxes as <br/>
odor-free as possible. Don't use containers that once held food unless <br/>
you've carefully cleaned, sterilized, disinfected, aired out and <br/>
decontaminated them to remove trace odors. Don't use scented inks. Never <br/>
leave food or candy in a letterbox. (If anyone ever finds food in a <br/>
letterbox and even thinks about consuming it, didn't your mother ever teach <br/>
you about taking candy from strangers?)<br/>
<br/>
Baby wipes are usually heavily scented -- after all, their intended use is <br/>
to clean up a stinky mess! But even the "unscented" variety baby wipes <br/>
still may have a smell -- it's just that the manufacturer doesn't add any <br/>
perfume to the soap on the wipes. Using any baby wipe to clean a letterbox <br/>
stamp leaves a smell that's not much better than leaving a bag of Purina <br/>
Grizzly Chow next to the letterbox, inviting all creatures in the area to <br/>
come have a bedtime snack.<br/>
<br/>
I think that a better alternative is to simply to put some damp paper <br/>
towels in a baggie and use them instead. Or just use a paper towel and some <br/>
water from the bottle you carry with you for drinking.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the rant, but I've seen too many letterboxes mangled by animals <br/>
and I think we should all be extra careful in our letterboxing practices.<br/>

<br/>
I couldn't agree more on not using baby wipes or any kind of soaped <br/>
or scented towelette on stamps, both in terms of being bad for stamps <br/>
and attracting animals.  Having had a couple of boxes ripped to <br/>
shreds by curious critters within the past few weeks, any precaution <br/>
that can be taken to prevent it, is worthwhile.  I like the idea of <br/>
carrying both wet and dry, unsoaped toweling in baggies.<br/>
<br/>
And I am not a fan of pigment ink because it tends to be goopy and <br/>
messier than dye ink if not properly cleaned from the stamp..<br/>
<br/>
But, as far as the toothbrush goes...  I'm sure there might be <br/>
validity to this being a great way to clean the tiny little crevices <br/>
of rubber stamps -- store bought stamps cut from hard rubber.  But <br/>
please don't use a toothbrush, or any other rubbing cleaning method, <br/>
to clean delicate hand-carved stamps.  Most of the carving material <br/>
that we use for stamps is not the same composition as store-bought <br/>
rubber stamps; it is much softer.  Just normal use can cause these to <br/>
deteriorate and tear over time, the abrasiveness of a toothbrush <br/>
would only be helping that along.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are stamp scrubbers out there that have a surface a lot like a baby hairbrush cut short.  They do a great job of getting ink out of crevices.  It also helps to carry a piece of scrap paper and to stamp multiple times to get as much ink off as possible before you begin actually cleaning up the stamp.  Hope this is helpful.<br/>

Yo Doug!  What's this "Silent" stuff!?!  Love your boxes and carvings, by <br/>
the way.  One additional "anti-babywipes" comment: over time they WILL <br/>
gum-up stamps.  The last few boxes we've found have had stamps in fairly <br/>
"nasty" condition, primarily due to pigment ink use.  We carry wet paper <br/>
towels with us and clean all stamps before and after use - and we've been <br/>
wiping out stamp bags pretty regularly now, too.  Dye inks clean up much <br/>
easier - the best way to clean up after pigment ink is with a toothbrush, <br/>
dish detergent and running water, especially with intricate stamps.  We're <br/>
considering carrying an old tooth brush loaded with a little detergent, <br/>
then using our drinking water bottle to rinse stamps off.  I know folks <br/>
really like the look of pigment ink pads, and perhaps they haven't had any <br/>
trouble cleaning up after their use, but over time it really builds <br/>
up.  Adding baby-wipe residue can just make matters worse.  Maybe most <br/>
people don't really care if their stamped image has ink from other's stamp <br/>
pads, but our "team" is completely obsessed with having our images look <br/>
EXACTLY like we want them (I've mentioned before we carry 6 different <br/>
Kaleidacolor dye ink pads so we can pick just the right color combinations <br/>
for each stamp we find) - also, as rabid rubber stampers, we can't STAND <br/>
dirty stamps.  Yes, we should get some therapy.<br/>

&gt;This is one of my pet peeves, so I have to add my own two cents on the<br/>
&gt;issue of cleaning stamps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes, of course you should *always* clean the ink off a stamp before you<br/>
&gt;replace it in a letterbox. But NOT with a baby wipe....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The most significant risk to the longevity of a letterbox in the wild<br/>
&gt;(IMHO) does not come from intentional vandals, or careless, sloppy<br/>
&gt;letterboxers (though they may be from closely related genuses and we can<br/>
&gt;only hope that they'll breed themselves out into extinction sooner rather<br/>
&gt;than later), but from nature itself. Letterboxes have been destroyed by<br/>
&gt;rain, snow, ice, flooding, fire, falling trees, rockslides, humorless parks<br/>
&gt;officials (and so on). Most letterboxers are conscious of doing what we can<br/>
&gt;to protect our letterboxes from these hazards, by packing them in<br/>
&gt;watertight containers, avoiding hollows in rotting trees, not planting<br/>
&gt;boxes streamside when water levels are low, avoiding national parks, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But the single biggest risk comes from the critters that live in the great<br/>
&gt;outdoors. Racoons, bears, otters, mice, squirrels, chipmunks and other<br/>
&gt;four-legged varmints spend their days foraging through forests and parks,<br/>
&gt;sniffing out interesting smells and potential food sources. With their<br/>
&gt;extra-sensitive noses, they can find a letterbox with no trouble at all --<br/>
&gt;and then chew through it or get the lid off without any problem at all.<br/>
&gt;(Over the winter, squirrels chewed holes in the lid of my Rubbermaid<br/>
&gt;Toughneck 30-gallon trash can, so some puny plastic letterbox container is<br/>
&gt;no problem for them. Bears have made off with my trash cans twice now, too.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;These critters don't read clues to find letterboxes, and they don't find<br/>
&gt;them by sight -- they find them by smell. Anyone who camps in bear country<br/>
&gt;knows about bear bags -- putting all of your food and scented items<br/>
&gt;(including deodorant, detergent, hand lotion, soap) in a duffel bag, and<br/>
&gt;then hoisting the bag 15 or 20 feet into the air using ropes strung over a<br/>
&gt;tree branches at some distance from your campsite. The idea is not only to<br/>
&gt;protect your food from the bears, but to keep the bears from getting<br/>
&gt;curious about interesting smells in and around your tent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As a result, letterboxers should be careful to keep letterboxes as<br/>
&gt;odor-free as possible. Don't use containers that once held food unless<br/>
&gt;you've carefully cleaned, sterilized, disinfected, aired out and<br/>
&gt;decontaminated them to remove trace odors. Don't use scented inks. Never<br/>
&gt;leave food or candy in a letterbox. (If anyone ever finds food in a<br/>
&gt;letterbox and even thinks about consuming it, didn't your mother ever teach<br/>
&gt;you about taking candy from strangers?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Baby wipes are usually heavily scented -- after all, their intended use is<br/>
&gt;to clean up a stinky mess! But even the "unscented" variety baby wipes<br/>
&gt;still may have a smell -- it's just that the manufacturer doesn't add any<br/>
&gt;perfume to the soap on the wipes. Using any baby wipe to clean a letterbox<br/>
&gt;stamp leaves a smell that's not much better than leaving a bag of Purina<br/>
&gt;Grizzly Chow next to the letterbox, inviting all creatures in the area to<br/>
&gt;come have a bedtime snack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think that a better alternative is to simply to put some damp paper<br/>
&gt;towels in a baggie and use them instead. Or just use a paper towel and some<br/>
&gt;water from the bottle you carry with you for drinking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry for the rant, but I've seen too many letterboxes mangled by animals<br/>
&gt;and I think we should all be extra careful in our letterboxing practices.<br/>
