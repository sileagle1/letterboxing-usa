<br/>
Sorry if this has been asked and answered and/or explained already, <br/>
but I was wondering what the plan was in moving clues from the old <br/>
site ot the new site if the original poster does not move them <br/>
themselves.  Perhaps the poster planted the box a couple years ago or <br/>
so and no longer letterboxes (parish the thought!) or maybe they just <br/>
don't read the board so they aren't aware that they need to move <br/>
their clues.<br/>
<br/>
There are a bunch of boxes in my area that haven't moved yet and I'd <br/>
hate to lose them when the old site finally shuts down.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone enlighten me as to what the plan is?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
