                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all!  Melinda and Vesta are having another carve your own rubber stamp <br/>
class!  Here are the details:<br/>
<br/>
April 16 (Wed) 6-8 p.m.  at Stamp Studio in Manchester, CT<br/>
<br/>
Back again by popular demand!  In this class you will learn how to create and <br/>
transfer images onto rubber and how to carve those images into usable stamps. <br/>
 Unlike other "carve your own" classes, we will cover techniques like <br/>
shadowing, shading and texturing.  It's easy and fun for all levels.  This is <br/>
a great class for those that have discovered letterboxing.  Carving rubber <br/>
will be supplied, however you will need to bring carving tools if you have <br/>
them, or purchase them the night of the class.  $22.<br/>
<br/>
Call Melinda at 860-432-1087 to reserve your space!  Space I believe is <br/>
limited to nine people... and last time, there was a HUGE waiting list!  <br/>
BTW.... if any letterboxers do decide to go to the class, let me know, I'll <br/>
stop in (since I live up the street) and exchange with you :-)  Also, don't <br/>
forget, I have a house box, and the STamp studio has a letterbox as well, so <br/>
BRING THE CLUES!!!!<br/>
