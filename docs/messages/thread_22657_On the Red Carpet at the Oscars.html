more worthy than others. <br/>
<br/>
It is a healthy, humbling experience -- the affirmation that you are <br/>
less than others.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad letterboxing is not like those self-esteem soccer groups <br/>
where all the children go home with a trophy just for playing and <br/>
being good sports.<br/>
<br/>
I do hope that folks will take the time to recognize and accept their <br/>
caste and strive diligently for something better the next year. <br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, here are some apologies for the unqualified boxers:<br/>
<br/>
1. For those who've just begun this hobby, sorry, you have five years <br/>
to go before you become a blip on the sonar, but it's good to learn <br/>
your worth before come to enjoy the hobby too much. Let me spell it <br/>
out for you - You don't matter just now.<br/>
<br/>
2. Sorry also to any of you who simply carve and plant for the <br/>
enjoyment of others - you need to attend gatherings and up that X <br/>
count!<br/>
<br/>
3. Anyone limited in mobility or in "dry" counties - good luck <br/>
achieving the minimum required PFX - we'll review your stats in <br/>
another 10 years.<br/>
<br/>
4. Any of you who've retreated to a more clandestine way of <br/>
letterboxing in order to prevent those boxes from being abused -- oh <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
5. Anyone who boxes without counting - you should've been keeping <br/>
track and publicly bragging about your PFX.<br/>
<br/>
6. If you can't carve worth a whistle (3 or below on Poison Ivy's <br/>
Letterbox Rating System), or perhaps a condition prevents you from <br/>
carving - well, shucks. Perhaps this hobby isn't for you.<br/>
<br/>
7. If you've ever been the tiniest bit abrasive and offended even the <br/>
most thin-skinned - sorry - you're understandably off the list of <br/>
nominees.<br/>
<br/>
8. Finally - my personal and sincere apology to anyone who reads this <br/>
and wonders that letterboxing is not worth the effort because of the <br/>
remarks of one. Letterboxing is NOT this Yahoo Group of yahoos. I <br/>
really enjoy this hobby. I enjoy the artistic side, the treasure <br/>
hunt, sometimes the hike, the creativity and some of the attempts at <br/>
creativity. I like the eagerness of (some) new letterboxers and <br/>
looking at their first stamps and improvement with time. I really <br/>
enjoy meeting folks on the trail, commiserating with like-minded <br/>
boxers and plotting mischievious fun. I applaud the effort that more <br/>
established or more willing boxers have put forth to create enjoyable <br/>
experiences. If the bulk of this note has given you pause to wonder <br/>
whether boxing is for you - please hit delete and go experience <br/>
boxing before you decide.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oooh, I am SO hesitant to jump into this discussion. I've enjoyed the<br/>
relatively flame-free conversations that this board has had lately.<br/>
<br/>
But here goes -- my attempt at being a diplomat.<br/>
<br/>
The idea by Wanda and Pete -- that is, to highlight some of this<br/>
hobby's most noted individuals -- is a good one, IMHO.  But perhaps,<br/>
as people like Poision Ivy point out, the approach is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I also post on some boards at the Motley Fool (www.fool.com).  It's a<br/>
financial website that has a number of financial-related boards, but<br/>
also a fair number of social boards as well.<br/>
<br/>
Each year, the Motely Fool awards its "Feste Award".  This award is<br/>
bestowed annually on "one member of the community that best<br/>
exemplifies our mission of Learning Together" (based on the Motley<br/>
Fool's mission).<br/>
<br/>
As the award is a community award, the Fool asks for nominations,<br/>
reviews them internally, and comes up with a list of 10 "finalists". <br/>
This list is then voted on by the community at large.<br/>
<br/>
As The Motley Fool is a commercial site, the winner receives<br/>
recognition and some monetary gain (in the form of free subscriptions).<br/>
<br/>
So, what if we here in the letterboxing community meet in the middle<br/>
and adopt a similar approach?  Rather than having Wanda and Pete<br/>
arbitrarly determine who should win the "Oscar", let's consider<br/>
opening up the floor to recommendations for this Lifetime Achievement<br/>
Award ... we could collect nominations for a period of time and, as we<br/>
don't have an selection committee, send the nominations through two<br/>
rounds of voting ... one to narrow the list to the finalists, and one<br/>
to pick the actual receipient.<br/>
<br/>
Might this approach be a reasonable compromise?  Heck, maybe even<br/>
Poision Ivy will be nominated!<br/>

Would that you knew our dear Ivy as I do. Would that she were not<br/>
given to the reductio ad absurdum argument. Her Ladyship nearly<br/>
snapped her strand of perfectly matched Mikimoto's as she clutched<br/>
them upon reading your appraisal of Ivy rhetorical skills. While she<br/>
is not incapable of being clear and articulate she is perhaps the<br/>
Goddess, not queen, not empress, but omnipotent, ne plus ultra of the<br/>
art of reductio ad absurdum. Thank you indeed for a hearty laugh. Now,<br/>
if you'll excuse her Ladyship she must find her logbook so that<br/>
Bartleby can begin counting.  Her Ladyship has never done this but<br/>
just to confirm, if someone accidentally touched her Ladyship's hand<br/>
bound Moroccan leather logbook at a crowded gather and left a smudge<br/>
of stray ink that still counts as an F, correct?<br/>
