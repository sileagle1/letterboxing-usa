I have been lurking for about a month - found Tom's virtual LetterBook<br/>
a couple of weeks ago and have been attempting to read maps and <br/>
practicing with a compass since then! I went out today determined to <br/>
find my first box and was treated to a wonderful experience in the <br/>
Commecticut College Arboretum with a positive result! Thanks Melissa <br/>
and Dan!. I am sister to another new letterboxer who is hoping to <br/>
spark more enthusiasm in Michigan - Mirkwood. <br/>
<br/>
I was first introduced to letterboxing a while back as a mother and <br/>
son came to my place of business looking for their signature stamps. <br/>
Sounded fascinating but only recently did I come acrosss the LbNA <br/>
website and now I think I am hooked. I carry Staedler MarsCarve <br/>
carving blocks and Speedball tools should anyone want to carve their <br/>
own images and need a source for the basics. I carved my first,<br/>
second and third stamps in no time - what fun! Hope to continue the <br/>
quest on a regular basis- its just hard working 6 and 7 days. <br/>
<br/>
To Chip at EMS: Will be out searching Old PepperBox soon! Thanks so <br/>
much for your help.<br/>

for you because Connecticut has a zillion and one boxes -- until I <br/>
can get others in Michigan interested, I'll have to satisfy myself <br/>
with only placing them here!<br/>
