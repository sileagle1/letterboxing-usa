Was I happy to see your post!  I'm not in Montana, but down in Eastern ID<br/>
and it sounds like you are on the side that I can get to of Montana.  There<br/>
may not be many up there, and there aren't here either, but I am excited<br/>
about LBing and willing to travel.  The other ID boxer is in the west, but<br/>
also travels well.  I'm sure we can be talked into some trips north.<br/>
<br/>
I am also planning on some plants a little closer to you in addition to the<br/>
few I have planted here in my area.  I want to do a whole series in the West<br/>
Yellowstone/Island Park area, which is quite close to home, and I have to go<br/>
up to Salmon, ID on business this month and hope to make some plants then.<br/>
That isn't too super far from Missoula.<br/>
<br/>
Let's keep in touch and band together.  I just gasp at the possiblity of<br/>
these PFX500 types back East and some in the far west.  I have letterboxed<br/>
every weekend this month, gone to three states, and am still at a whopping<br/>
P4.  I laughed after I typed in some of my clues telling people that they<br/>
should continue on from one of my boxes to the next because they were close<br/>
together and it was only on further reflection that I realized that they are<br/>
still an hour's drive apart with one in ID and the other in Wyoming!  I<br/>
guess the west is a little different.  Anyway, I will be just happy to trek<br/>
up your direction for some boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
