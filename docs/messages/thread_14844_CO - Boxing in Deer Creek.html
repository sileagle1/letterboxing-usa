Creek and Soar feet.  What wonderful spots!!  Both boxes are in good <br/>
shape and I put the stamp from the Deer Creek box into a new ziploc <br/>
baggie, just in case it has to see snow before it sees another <br/>
visitor.  I will e-mail the planter individually and let them know <br/>
how their boxes are fairing.  You can count on some coming from me <br/>
soon!!<br/>
<br/>
Talk to ya'all soon!!<br/>

PS:  Trinity Jah made this 4 mile hike with us and did beautifully!!  <br/>
She only had one fit as we were starting back down.  What a <br/>
soldier!!  She can't wait to go and do more!!<br/>
