my way home from Boston and found three great boxes planted by phyto.<br/>
The stamps were just gorgeous and the clues were spot on. I suggest<br/>
bringing markers and or an ink pad with you, beacuse two of the boxes<br/>
don't have ink pads. Wish I'd had markers in a variety of colors for<br/>
one of the stamps... it would have been beautiful! It was a great walk<br/>
and as the first finder there was an extra treat in the fairy houses<br/>
box... pretty shells etc. with glitter for the first finder! Thank you<br/>
phyto and isoceles for more nice boxes relatively local to me! Can't<br/>
wait to find some more this weekend.<br/>
