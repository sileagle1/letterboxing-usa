                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been asked to do a short program about letterboxing at the Bangor Public Library <br/>
(Maine)  this summer for kids aged 4 through 10. I've been boxing for over 4 years now <br/>
and am a librarian myself (and have letterboxing kids) so I thought it would be fun. Any <br/>
ideas on what I should do? There is a box hidden in the library already. I was thinking of <br/>
compiling a list of clues to a few local kid-friendly boxes for everyone to take home and <br/>
maybe make up a sample trail kit for the kids to look at. I would give a brief intro into it <br/>
and then talk about all of the great skills and learning opportunities it incorporates. With <br/>
an age range of 4 to 10, however, it will be interesting to make it interesting to everyone. I <br/>
was thinking of getting permission to hide 2 temporary boxes in or around the library in <br/>
addition to the one already there so that three different age groups would have a chance <br/>
to search.  <br/>
<br/>
I would love thoughts and comments and ideas on this from anyone and those who have <br/>
done a program like this before.<br/>
<br/>
I am certain to emphasize responsibility in the search and to the natural area around the <br/>
box, as well as gaining the proper permission to hide boxes. I will also make sure I have <br/>
plenty of spare baggies and paper towels in my trail pack to encourage the on the fly <br/>
repair aspect of it all too.<br/>

I'll include links to letterboxing.com and atlasquest too.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings! I have taught classes for a Parks and Recreation program. These are family <br/>
programs, with parents involved. I believe an adult should always be present when <br/>
letterboxing with kids. Most young 'uns can always use supervision when learning leave no <br/>
trace ethics and with hiding letterboxes well. Stealth does not come naturally to most.<br/>
<br/>
I would never distributed clues to any existing letterboxes. Most letterboxers would not <br/>
appreciated their creations being used in such a program. I have enlisted the aid of several <br/>
local boxers who hid new boxes specifically for these classes. The websites where other <br/>
clues could be found were given in the class materials so that those who had more than a <br/>
passing interest could follow through on their own. <br/>
<br/>
The most important part of such a class in my book is to pass on the information found in <br/>
the LbNA and Atlas Quest educational materials. Comb those FAQs and tutorials. Including <br/>
the parents is the best way to ensure survival of any letterboxes you use in this program. <br/>

<br/>
LOL--too funny!<br/>
<br/>
I agree about making it a parent/child endeavor for liability issues, <br/>
but also because the 4 year old is going to need a lot of hands on help.<br/>
Does your library have a reading theme for the summer?  Perhaps tying <br/>
it into that would be fun.<br/>
<br/>
In creating program for kids before, one of the things I've learned is <br/>
not to pack so much into the activity that you get pressed for time.  <br/>
Sometimes it's better to just whet their appetites and leave them <br/>
curious for more. Certainly this will be true with such a diverse age <br/>
group.  I would also be careful to keep it at the kid level even though <br/>
parents will be there.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck--sounds like fun!<br/>
