Why when I use the "back" button when on letterboxing.org, even very <br/>
quickly, it says it has expired? I "refresh" and  hit "yes" and I'm on <br/>

Is this to throw off search engines somehow?<br/>

It's really Web Sites 101 -- many parts of the site are dynamic, which<br/>
means that the pages are generated on the fly when you navigate<br/>
through the site (particularly the search pages). As a result, the<br/>
pages don't actually exist on their own and so if you try to display<br/>
them again using the back button, the page has to be rebuilt from<br/>
scratch. Your browser is just asking if you want to do that. You can<br/>
circumvent it somewhat by opening a web page by right clicking and<br/>
choosing to open the link in a new window, or a new tab (if your<br/>
browser is tab-enabled).<br/>
