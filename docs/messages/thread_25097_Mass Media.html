                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to agree.  Without the Family Circle article years ago, Silver Eagle and I would not have started this crazy game.   I have been asked to do multiple interviews, but have been very selective in doing so, making sure all the facts are given and that the article will direct the reader to LBNA to get more facts before starting.  We had no idea what we were doing when we went for our first box, but after finding it, we got on the website and learned enough to get us going.  Hard to believe it has almost be 7 years.  So far I have done 2 articles, in regional publications.   I like the smaller format for discussion of letterboxing, and feel the bigger outlets will not spend enough time on the subject to do it justice, but that is just me.   I guess my personal belief is that if you give an interview, you are responsible for the outcome, thus I am very careful about doing so. <br/>

&gt; You know, I felt this way, too, always do, for a moment when I hear about<br/>
&gt; national exposure for Lbing.  But then I have to stop and remember that the<br/>
&gt; reason I've been doing this for five years straight is because of the Time<br/>
&gt; Magazine article.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,665043,00.html<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I chopped that article out of that magazine so fast, and I was off finding<br/>
&gt; letterboxes within a week.  I did all the stupid n00b things -- I didn't<br/>
&gt; read the history before I went out searching, didn't realize I needed my own<br/>
&gt; stamp (had to find my first box twice), asked for help with clues online<br/>
&gt; instead of digging through my brain to find the answer, whined at people<br/>
&gt; when things were *too hard*, etc etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But July 18th will be my fifth year anniversary.  I've probably found 300<br/>
&gt; boxes.  I've placed maybe 5.  I've been to one gathering, and while the<br/>
&gt; people there were super nice (props, Wisconsin), it just wasn't my thing.  I<br/>
&gt; box alone, or with my husband.  I don't rate my success by my PFX count -- I<br/>
&gt; rate it by the fact that I've explored southeastern Wisconsin, Las Vegas,<br/>
&gt; Moab, Phoenix, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and soon Seattle and Vancouver with<br/>
&gt; other people's boxes as my tour guides.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I have repaired, re-bagged, and re-hidden everything I've ever found,<br/>
&gt; and always leave it better than when I found it.  And seeing the state of<br/>
&gt; some of these boxes, not everyone can say that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, yeah, we'll get another influx of n00bs, families, kids, more boxes will<br/>
&gt; go missing, lame boxes will show up, something that annoys everyone will<br/>
&gt; eventually show up, but you know, maybe 5 years down the line we'll have<br/>
&gt; whittled the influx down to another core generation that loves this game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers to anyone else out there of the Time Magazine Generation.  Happy<br/>
&gt; Fifth Anniversary.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: [LbNA] NBC's Today Show - letterboxing mention<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Today Show just had a brief mention of letterboxing during a segment on<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; things to do." They showed the main page of the LbNA web site, as well as<br/>
&gt; &gt; the U.S. map on the Clues page, but I didn't catch all the audio. Perhaps<br/>
&gt; &gt; the clip will be up on the website in the next few days (<br/>
&gt; &gt; http://today.msnbc<br/>
&gt; &gt; msn.com) In the meantime, those of you in the western timezones might<br/>
&gt; &gt; still catch it this morning... it was about 37 minutes after the hour.<br/>
