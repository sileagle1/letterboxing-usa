I set out with my friend sunvalleysu, her two children and my husband <br/>
to go letterboxing in Richmond, VA. I have to say that we lucked out <br/>
with a beautiful day. We first tried to find a letterbox planted by <br/>
mlgainey@yahoo.com and had no luck. We are fairly confident that we <br/>
found the directions exactly and could not find it. The clues were <br/>
vague when it says, "the box is hidden 46 paces from the light pole <br/>
on your right".  We went every way we could think of and were <br/>
unsuccessful. Does anyone know if this box is still there? There was <br/>
one place we thought it could be but it was overgrown with poison ivy <br/>
so we didn't investigate too much. On a much happier note we went to <br/>
find the "Spyder" and found that in good shape. We also found a <br/>
hitchhiker which took some of the blues away. If anyone goes to find <br/>
the "Spyder" box it could use some more stamping pads. When we <br/>
finished there we took an excursion to Maymont which has a lot of <br/>
exhibits with animals etc and a tram which goes around the whole <br/>
grounds. I'm sure there is somewhere there a letterbox could be <br/>
planted. The last box we found was "Belle Isle" which was a great <br/>
spot. I highly reccommend doing this box when it is dry unless you <br/>
have shoes with great traction because again I was out in my little <br/>
Keds. I got up the hills okay but coming down I was a little <br/>
squimish. However, I have a great hubby and he told me to wrap my <br/>
arms around him and hold on. He got me down the hills safe and sound. <br/>
The day turned out to be a beautful and successful outing. <br/>
<br/>
I am going to the Hampton Roads area this weekend to see my parens <br/>
and was wondering what boxes were missing. I hope to get to out but <br/>
again it looks like it is going to rain. <br/>

The box was there around March. I'll check on it in the very near<br/>
future. Sorry you found the clues vague; if it's any consolation, when<br/>
I checked around March, lots of people had stamped in. <br/>

I would really appreciate it if you would go and check on it. We <br/>
didn't want to mess up the plants looking for it. The only clue we <br/>
found vague was which way to take the 46 steps.  Thanks again.<br/>
