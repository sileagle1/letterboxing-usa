fall day.  <br/>
Hope everyone had a chance to take advantage of this great<br/>
weather.  <br/>
The day was perfect as well as the clues. <br/>
The first box was found safe and sound with a really neat<br/>
stamp.  The second box we did not find.  I know we were in<br/>
the correct place as the directions were very good.<br/>
  Has anyone had a problem with this box being missing?  <br/>
Thanks for the lovely hike.<br/>
