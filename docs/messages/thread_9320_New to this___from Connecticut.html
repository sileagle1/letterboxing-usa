amazed.  Found several challenges witing a short drive from my home in <br/>
Central Connecticut.<br/>
<br/>
Plan to have my dog be my partner in all of this.  He'll enjoy the hiking as <br/>
much as I!<br/>
<br/>
If any folks have suggestions - I'd welcome them!<br/>

Until later.<br/>

Welcome aboard. I am Leader of the Pack I live in eastern Ct. Most of <br/>
us adopt trail names some just go by their own. You and your dog <br/>
should have a stamp to mark the log books. There are several rather <br/>
popular dogs in the area. Max, Molly to name two.  Plan for safety <br/>
orange clothing, flshlight tell someone where you will be ,first aid <br/>
kit, watch the sun it sets so early this time of year.  If you follow <br/>
baseball then you know about stats, well letterboxers keep stats too, <br/>
well some do any way. F =  a box or hitch hiker box that you found, <br/>
P=  a box you plant or hide regular or hitchhiker, X= exchange with <br/>
another letterboxer you meet on the trail or at a gathering  E= <br/>
event ,we have gatherings which usually sport a special one time only <br/>
stamp. There are a few other  stats folks keep for fun like bench <br/>
marks and lizards.  Anyway it is lots of fun and you will find some <br/>
great new places via clues to other peoples favorite spots.  There is <br/>
a continual  story of boxes and  clues popping up here every day. So <br/>
give it a try you'll be hooked after your first box found! <br/>
