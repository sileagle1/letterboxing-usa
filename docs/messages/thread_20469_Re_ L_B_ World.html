I cannot speak for the LbPNW list, as I do not know the situation there.<br/>
<br/>
As for speculation as to whether or not a member of this community is <br/>
responsible for the problems with LBWorld, unless you have direct proof to<br/>
back up the accusations, let's give it a rest. Unfounded accusations serve<br/>
no one's best interest.<br/>
<br/>
There's room enough for everyone's site. And while I personally don't spend <br/>
much time on LBWorld, I wish them all the luck in getting everything back <br/>
up and running. I would hope everyone here feels similarly.<br/>

<br/>
Point taken.  Thanks for the clarification.  But to me, it kinda <br/>
seems like splitting hairs to differentiate between moderating his <br/>
messages in order to reject them all, and banning them altogether.<br/>
<br/>
Seems like it would have been better to just make sure the LbNA site <br/>
was better than his, rather than to moderate him and ban any messages <br/>
that mentioned his site.<br/>

<br/>
Steve had been on moderated status on the LbPNW list, though I had <br/>
lifted it before he unsubscribed from all the talk lists.<br/>
<br/>
It was only a couple of weeks ago he tried to resubscribe to the <br/>
Pacific Northwest board, which left me in somewhat of a dilemna.  In <br/>
all honesty, I liked the board much better when I knew I wouldn't <br/>
have to read his posts on it.  But in all fairness, what to do?  <br/>
Steve has been very divisive in the letterboxing world, which I don't <br/>
really like.  Differences of opinions are one thing, but he seems <br/>
really big on splitting letterboxing into two competing groups which <br/>
just runs me the raw way.<br/>
<br/>
I've deliberately stayed away from Steve's website to give him space <br/>
free from me.  He seemed happy over there, and I liked it that way.  <br/>
Let him have his space, and let me have mine.<br/>
<br/>
It might be selfish, I suppose, but I know darned well if he joined <br/>
the Pacific Northwest board again, it would only be a matter of time <br/>
before we butted heads again which wouldn't make the board fun for <br/>
*anyone*.  Under the protective flag that Steve had his own soapbox <br/>
with lots of friends and supporters to discuss all things <br/>
letterboxing, and after several days of debating the issue with <br/>
myself, I finally told him no, I'd rather him not come back.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn't actually outright ban him from the Pacific Northwest board, <br/>
however.  I just didn't allow him to post to the board.  Last I knew, <br/>
he's still a member and can read all the messages unless he chose to <br/>
quit himself.<br/>
<br/>
While I think hacking his site was a dispictable act--both because it <br/>
is an unethical, vile thing to do, but also because it gives him more <br/>
sympathy than I think he deserves.  He posts about somebody taking <br/>
advantage of a security hole on September 19th when the security <br/>
issue was published online on the 16th.  Why did he leave his site <br/>
vunerable to serious, crippling attacks for three precious days?  <br/>
What happened to his backups so he wouldn't have to recreate the site <br/>
from scratch again?<br/>
<br/>
It may not be politically correct to tell a victim of a home robbery <br/>
that it was stupid of them to leave their front door unlocked, but my <br/>
sympathy only goes so far.  But then to allow it to happen a SECOND <br/>
time?!<br/>
<br/>
I hope they catch perp who did this, but I have a really difficult <br/>
time feeling much sympathy for the data that was lost.  Once, shame <br/>
on you.  Twice, shame on me.<br/>
<br/>
I hope he gets his site back up soon so this thread will die.<br/>

Yeah, I guess cross-posting and mentioning one's own letterboxing <br/>
