Subject: [LbNA] Thanks to all who participated in the letterbox <br/>
research - the results are in!<br/>
<br/>
  Back in November you were invited to participate in a web-based survey<br/>
about letterboxing as part of a doctoral dissertation. Well, I have<br/>
now completed the data analysis and written the report of my findings.<br/>
 To take a look at what I learned about the 355 participants in my<br/>
study, check out my blog at www.letterblogger.blogspot.com.  I am<br/>
adding new information to the blog every day for the next two weeeks.<br/>
 Thanks again to those who participated and supported me.  Your<br/>
comments on the blog are encouraged.  Be well and do good things.<br/>
