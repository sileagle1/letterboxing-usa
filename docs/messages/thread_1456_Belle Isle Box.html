is a wonderful diversion surrounded by conflicting sights and <br/>
sounds.....the footbridge over the James with views of the skyline, <br/>
interstate overpasses, CSX freight trains thundering by, and the <br/>
serene monuments of Hollywood Cemetery off in the distance.  <br/>
Following the clues to the Belle Isle box leads you through some <br/>
surprisingly interesting wooded trails....many more walks to explore <br/>
in the future.  The intersections and forks are many, but if you pay <br/>
close attention to the clues, you'll have your reward.  Allow enough <br/>
time to enjoy this one...and bring a buddy if at all possible...the <br/>
woods are a little spooky alone.<br/>
<br/>
And, to the next "Voyager" who "treks" to Belle Isle, a surprise <br/>
waits docked behind the Belle Isle box.<br/>

and will take her out to sea soon.<br/>
