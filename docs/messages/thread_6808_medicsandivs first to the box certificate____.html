i think the "FIRST" certificate is a neat idea, but as far as <br/>
encouraging other boxers, if the nifty "things to do" article in the <br/>
local paper and encouragement from friends arent enough, the only <br/>
thing that will do it is a cash reward. it is a strange world and <br/>
time we live in. i was a little dissapointed to plant my first box <br/>
and 4 days later my husband and kid were the first to find it... (AND <br/>
I MADE THEM INTERPRET THE CLUES)<br/>
but it would be really neat to get a certificate for a "first".<br/>
best of luck, hope i can get it,<br/>
