Thanks for your input.  You've got some good ideas, even if you were just<br/>
being silly.  This is the sort of co-ed search party I had in mind.  We could<br/>
have one wise, though short-sighted, inspector-type main character along with<br/>
several "sidekick" characters without whom the search would fail.  Not so much<br/>
for the sake of being politically correct, but just to convey the idea that<br/>
everyone can cooperate and enjoy this hobby together.  After all, this isn't<br/>
something that one kid should go off and do alone.  It's something for the<br/>
whole family or a group of friends.<br/>
<br/>
As for the erasers, I have also made small stamps by carving into pencil<br/>
erasers (firmly attached to the pencil).  But I think you missed the topic of<br/>
discussion.  We were referring to the idea of using empty pencil eraser<br/>
casings as a safe carving tool for kids.  This came from the pages I've been<br/>
preparing for Kids Corner.  Take a look, if you haven't already:<br/>

LOL yep, I missed that completely. My apologies!  I mean, actually, I remember<br/>
reading that now, but by the time I replied to later notes, I had forgotten<br/>
the actual topic. Sorry :-D<br/>
