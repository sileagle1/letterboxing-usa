                    <div class="plaintext-content">RIBNAG has planted its first box in Maine, and as two members<br/>
recently moved there, you can expect many more in the future.<br/>
Yes, we considered changing the name to "NEBNAG", but since<br/>
one of the people who moved also maintains our web-pages (namely,<br/>
myself), we decided that laziness dictate that the name not<br/>
change.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the box:<br/>
<br/>
Dust To Dust Letterbox<br/>
Bangor City Forest, ME<br/>
1 box (hopefully more to come), at least 2km hike.<br/>
<br/>
The clue lives at:<br/>
http://entropy.tmok.com/~ribnag/lb-dusttodust.shtml<br/>
<br/>
And of course, as always, you can access it through the main page:<br/>
http://entropy.tmok.com/~ribnag/index.shtml<br/>
<br/>
Don't let the name of the location fool you... Bangor City<br/>
Forest has very litle "city"-like about it, other than the<br/>
name and its proximity to Bangor (which also doesn't look<br/>
very city-like).<br/>
<br/>
Also, a small request... We have confirmed the "Wilcox Park"<br/>
box as missing.  Unfortunately, it seems that by some bizarre<br/>
oversight no RIBNAG'ers actually kept a copy of the stamp image<br/>
(I say "bizarre" due to the OCD-like nature of this webmaster...<br/>
you should see my spreadsheet of found boxes, I probably have<br/>
more data about each box than the people who planted it <g>).<br/>
So, if anyone managed to get it during its very short life<br/>
(first report came in within a month), could you email a scan<br/>
of the stamp image to ribnag@users.tmok.com?  We would like to<br/>
replace it.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, at least one person has asked permission to use the<br/>
"standard disclaimer" RIBNAG has at the top of each clue.  We<br/>
don't mind this at all, just give us credit (a link to the<br/>
RIBNAG homepage would suffice) and realize that none of us<br/>
have a law degree, so it "just sounds good" but probably has<br/>
no legal validity at all.<br/>
