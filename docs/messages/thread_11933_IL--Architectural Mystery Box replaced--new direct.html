Somewhere in the Chicago suburbs, Cook County, Illinois<br/>
Accessible by public transportation (CTA or Metra)<br/>
Easy, great for families.  No poison ivy.  No snakes.  <br/>
Film canister microbox.  You must bring your own stamp pad and pen.  <br/>

<br/>
In 1898 the man who would become the world's most famous architect <br/>
established his first studio in his home in this leafy suburb.  <br/>
Before he left town for more famous studios in Wisconsin and Arizona, <br/>
he designed more than 25 buildings, leaving the town an architectural <br/>
legacy that draws tens of thousands of visitors every year.  <br/>
One of the architect's most beautiful buildings, only a block away <br/>
from the Home and Studio, is the Frank W. Thomas House, built in <br/>
1901.  Across the street from the Thomas House is this town's only <br/>
statue of this famous son.  Although the architect was very short <br/>
(and unappreciative owners of his buildings sometimes complained that <br/>
doors and ceilings were built more to his height than to theirs) it <br/>
still hardly seems fair that the bust is set in a rock only about <br/>
three feet off the ground.   Your search for the letterbox begins <br/>
with this statue.<br/>
Just to the right of the statue a wrought iron gate leading into a <br/>
park.  Go into the park and take the path to your right.  Follow the <br/>
path past the wildflower gardens.  You will come to a majestic tree, <br/>
of the species obvious for the community (and no, it's not a <br/>
gingko).  The tree rises five or six feet from a huge trunk, and then <br/>
divides into two before continuing skyward. Continue past the tree to <br/>
the northeast corner of the park.  <br/>
As you leave the park turn and walk with the fence on your right.  Go <br/>
past an intersection of two fences.  Your fence will then make a <br/>
right angle turn to the north.  Stop and tie your shoe, or look for <br/>
whatever it is you dropped, right at that turn.  The box is fastened <br/>
to the underside of the bottom fence rail just after the turn.   THIS <br/>
PARK IS HEAVILY USED.  PLEASE BE DISCREET AS YOU FIND AND REPLACE THE <br/>
BOX!!!!!   <br/>
