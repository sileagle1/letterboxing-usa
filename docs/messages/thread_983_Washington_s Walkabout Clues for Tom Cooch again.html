<div>Tom,</div>
<div>    Let me know if you got the 
complete clue this time.</div>
<div><b><i>
<p>Washington’s Walkabout</p></i></b>
<p>We’ve upped the ante in the Presidential series since "<i>Lucky 
Penny."</i> This quest takes place in the George Washington Memorial State 
Forest found on Rte 44 in Glocester, RI and begins near the beach of the 
campground.</p>
<p>Following the "R.O.B." blazes be sure to check out the cool rock 
pile at a "quarter" mile from the start. The trail continues along the 
shore of Bowdish Reservoir with some nice views and vantage points before 
turning in a northeasterly direction. Continue to follow the "R.O.B." 
blazes as the trail skirts the edges of primitive and luxury campsites before 
the "B." splits to the right and you continue to "R.O." 
upstream to the Mt. Vernon of Vistas overlooking Wilbur Pond. Stand with your 
feet on "solid" ground with the next "R.O." markers at 330 
degrees. The trail you came in on is at 170 degrees. Take a third heading of 240 
degrees. Step off in this direction the number of years George Washington was 
President of the United States. Look directly below and "heads up" you 
win!</p>
<p>Reunite "R.O." with "B." whichever way you choose. Not 
long after the reunion of "R.O.B." keep your eyes peeled for a rather 
interesting knee high boulder with a split resting on the left edge of the 
trail. Venture further along the trail counting out your steps equal to the age 
of George Washington when he took his oath of office as the First President of 
the United States. Bushwhack from this point to the top of the feature before 
you at 240 degrees. Take a heading between two trees equal to the sum of the 
digits in the year George Washington died and spot the rock with a reminder of a 
tree fallen long ago. Here’s where you’ll find your 
"fill."</p>
<p>Head back to the trail and in a few minutes your "walkabout" will 
be complete.</p></div></body></html>

<br/>
I got the Washington Walkabout clues in the mail today, and have <br/>
reposted them in full. Sorry about my screwy e-mail system, Sarah!<br/>
<br/>
It's a great walkabout with nice trivia questions in it and I urge <br/>
any of you down that way to go for it. Most of you undoubtedly have, <br/>
as you all are not a bit dependent on our electronic bulletin board! <br/>
I can't remember if I told you, Sarah, how much I enjoyed walking <br/>
into your store and looking through your Letterboxing display! A nice <br/>
guy found a reference book out back so I could look up GW's date of <br/>
birth!<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
<br/>
