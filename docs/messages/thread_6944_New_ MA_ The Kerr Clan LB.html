Chesterfield Gorge, Chesterfield MA<br/>
(Hampshire County) <br/>
<br/>
Placed: August 13, 2002 by TehutiKa, AsetKa and kids! <br/>
Distance: 1/4 mile, if that<br/>
Time: Under a half hour, but you might want to stay a lot longer<br/>
Difficulty: Easy walk, some rough terrain.<br/>
<br/>
Take Rt 9 West through Northampton to Rt 143 in Williamsburg. Take Rt 143 <br/>
until you see the sign for Chesterfield Gorge on the left, just after you <br/>
cross over a bridge. Follow this street until you see the second sign for the <br/>
Gorge, and drive up to the parking lot. On weekends in season, there is a <br/>
$2.00 parking fee, but members of the Trustees of the Reservations are free. <br/>
You can get more information about this park, and the Trustees of the <br/>
Reservations at http://www.thetrustees.org.<br/>
<br/>
Chesterfield Gorge, in addition to being one of our favorite places to visit, <br/>
is also a very important place to two of our family members. Gary and Susan <br/>
Kerr, my wife's parents, were married here in 1994 in a private ceremony. So <br/>
private that it was just the two of them and the justice of the peace who met <br/>
them there!<br/>
<br/>
The stamp here is placed in honor of their wedding. The stamp itself is the <br/>
symbol and motto of the Clan Kerr. The Clan Motto is on the stamp, "Sero sed <br/>
Serio", which means, "Late but in earnest". I leave it to you to puzzle out <br/>
the meaning.<br/>
