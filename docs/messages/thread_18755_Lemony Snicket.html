I don't consider this drivel of any kind. It's a person, new to this hobbie,<br/>
potentially a great carver, hider, enthusiast, that wants to know. Just<br/>
because a person has made their way to the chat list does NOT mean they are<br/>
computer experts. As someone just the other day pointed out this is an<br/>
OUTDOOR hobby. It is a hobby that appeals to people that like to hike, solve<br/>
puzzles, and be OUTSIDE. No where in that description, or in any description<br/>
I've EVER seen does being a computer expert show up. What in the world does<br/>
it hurt for someone to say.. a hitchhiker is blah blah blah.. and to find<br/>
out more take a look at this link. It takes someone what, about 3 seconds.<br/>
Heck a discussion on hitchhikers might remind someone that's been doing this<br/>
a while that he has a hitchhiker he needs to get on its way, or that they<br/>
need to let the creator know it's been moved.. This is a hobby that involves<br/>
people sharing a piece of themselves with others, which should be done in a<br/>
safe and supportive manner.<br/>

Subject: Re: [LbNA] Lemony Snicket<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Since the topic of "Lemony Snicket" has come up I thought I'd throw<br/>
  my two cents in. Why a major buzz about these boxes hasn't started on<br/>
  this list is just beyond me. When something worthwhile comes up it<br/>
  seems to be just passed by and overlooked, instead we get the same<br/>
  old drivel and questions that have all been answered in the past or<br/>
  can be answered by simply doing a search of old posts or checking out<br/>
  the FAQ section of the website. "What's a hitchhiker?" Why does this<br/>
  question need to be addressed here when the answer to the question is<br/>
  so readily available to anybody who has a serious yearning to know.<br/>
  It's all right there in easily accessible areas, of not just the main<br/>
  website, but also on various other sites such as "Silent Dougs" great<br/>
  website. Maybe a few clicks of your mouse can answer these questions<br/>
  in a lot more timely and considerate manner than posting them to this<br/>
  list. As you know, I'm just a grumpy old man who has been "pissed<br/>
  off" about the way this game has been going in the past, and just to<br/>
  let you all know, I ain't changing anytime in the near, or distant<br/>
  future. Why anybody would begin a post with the statement " I'm sure<br/>
  this has been answered in the past" is in my eyes just idiotic. If<br/>
  you know it's been answered, go search for the answer, be self<br/>
  reliant, don't count on someone holding your hand and leading you<br/>
  along. Hell, that's the whole idea of letterboxing isn't it? Some of<br/>
  the best and most sought after boxes never even make it to the clue<br/>
  pages, you have to actually search for and discover these on your<br/>
  own. Which brings me back to the Lemony Snicket boxes, go find these,<br/>
  yes, they can be troublesome as you actually have to search the<br/>
  messages here on the talklist for the clues instead of just easily<br/>
  looking on the webpage for what is new in your area. But,believe me<br/>
  you, these boxes are well worth any extra effort you may have to take<br/>
  on your part. The one we found in FL was magnificent and well worth<br/>
  the battle we had with angry boars, gators, and armadillos. The best<br/>
  box, with the best stamp, and the best logbook I've ever seen.<br/>

  P.S.<br/>
<br/>
  If you are letting your kid stick his hand into dark scary places,<br/>
  God bless ya, Darwin spent a life time coming up with a theory aimed<br/>
  directly at you. Our future depends on people just like you ridding<br/>
  the world of stupid kids who don't know enough to keep from getting<br/>
  themselves killed by even stupider reptiles.<br/>
<br/>
  One other thing:<br/>
  Anybody asking any stupid questions at the carving class I'm giving<br/>
  in CT next month will just cause things to go horribly wrong and<br/>
  should be avoided at all cost.<br/>

Since Brian was clever enough to print off the clues when they were <br/>
posted, we can never use the secret words "Lemony Snicket" anymore?<br/>
<br/>
Many people who are new to the list don't know that they aren't <br/>
allowed to speak of letterboxing. Heaven forefend they post a message <br/>
without the proper state prefix. Someone might read it that doesn't <br/>
want to. Or mention "the Dark Side of Letterboxing" where children <br/>
find the boxes before the parents catch up.<br/>

I think we are forgetting that to the rest of the world "Elite <br/>
Letterboxer" is an oxymoron. It's not like we are doing anything <br/>

Maybe we should listen to Mark and "just get out there and box".<br/>

<br/>
  I don't believe that following a link from www.letterboxing.org to the FAQ or<br/>
searching the message list archives or just typing "letterboxing hitchhiker"<br/>
into Google makes me a computer expert.  That's all it would take to find the<br/>
answer.<br/>
<br/>
  As more and more people discover the internet, we (the current users) have the<br/>
right to hold our community to high standards of posting.  All of us only have<br/>
24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week. Shooting off a message without doing any<br/>
research isn't very considerate of the thousands of people that read the list.<br/>
<br/>
In RFC 1855, the standards of netiquette say:<br/>
  "Read both mailing lists and newsgroups for one to two months before you post<br/>
anything. This helps you to get an understanding of the culture of the group."<br/>
(If you're interesting in the whole thing:<br/>
http://www.dtcc.edu/cs/rfc1855.html )<br/>
<br/>
  Now that we have list archives, maybe waiting two months is a little extreme.<br/>
Maybe reading the last month's posts to familiarize yourself with the way things<br/>
work would be sufficient.  Obviously, it depends on volume.<br/>
<br/>
  In short, we need to be welcoming to new users, yet they need to be respectful<br/>
of the way things work.  If we tolerate ignorance, it will proliferate.  If we<br/>
create lots of crappy boxes*, then that's what people will expect.  On the other<br/>
hand, if we hold our art to a higher standard, then newcomers will as well.<br/>

It's not drivel!! Many times people don't have the time to sit and <br/>
sift through the various files of the various websites devoted to our <br/>
hobby! So they ask their questions when they join this list. <br/>
<br/>
I didn't see a disclaimer on the group page when I considered joining <br/>
this group that stated no one is allowed to ask the same question <br/>
twice, nor did I see a directive informing us that we are required to <br/>
read the entire archives prior to posting any questions.<br/>
<br/>
So...sorry if you feel that this is all drivel and repetitive <br/>
questions to you but to many it is a goldmine of information. If you <br/>
don't want to read the same stuff over and over..just hit the delete <br/>
button...after all it's not like we all know who reads every single <br/>
post and who doesn't. I know that I hit the delete button lots and in <br/>
fact I've been known to delete and entire digest because I don't have <br/>
time. I can always go back to the group page if needed to find out <br/>
what everyone is ranting/raving about later on.<br/>
<br/>
I also am aware that this is a huge group with many personalities and <br/>
that sooner or later there will be disagreements. Hopefully the <br/>
majority of listmembers are mature enough to sit back and shake their <br/>
collective heads as a minority makes absolute fools of themselves <br/>
nitpicking the smallest details over and over!!<br/>
<br/>
We all need to realize that sooner or later there will be the <br/>
opportunity to meet one another somewhere along the line and we will <br/>
most likely have a somewhat preformed opinion about that person. Most <br/>
likely directly caused/affected by our actions here on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I've just probably put myself on the top of the flame list <br/>
by even stooping to reply to this whole thread. Oh..well...I'll just <br/>
hit the delete button a little more....its not like anyone would know.<br/>
<br/>

being a computer expert is not a requirement, it does not take too <br/>
much expertise to make your way to the LbNA web site and read the FAQ <br/>
section.  On the home page of this list there is a link for list <br/>
etiquette which takes you to the LbNA website.  The very first item <br/>
on this page states, "Newbie questions are most often anwsered in the <br/>
FAQ or archive; your best bet is to check there first before posting, <br/>
as the list is very high volume."<br/>
<br/>
You are right, it is an innocent question, but there are over 1500 <br/>
members on this list and if everyone asked innocent questions without <br/>
taking the time to do some searching for answers on their own, the <br/>
volume of posts would be 100 times what it is now.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we were all new at one time, and I am sure I asked some stupid <br/>
questions back then also, but I am being totally honest when I say <br/>
thay I read every word of the LbNA FAQ and read back several months <br/>
in the list messages (at least scanned subject lines) first.<br/>
<br/>
There are countless resources available to new letterboxers -- <br/>
information on finding boxes, information on planting boxes, stamp <br/>
carving info and pictures, ideas for types of clues, definitions of <br/>
words and terminology -- in multiple places.  There are links to <br/>
these places in the files section of this and most of the regional <br/>
lists and most member informational sites belong to the letterboxing <br/>
web ring -- one has only to spend an evening surfing the web ring to <br/>
have the majority of all questions answered.<br/>
<br/>
I am tired of hearing that we need to make it "easier" for newbies.  <br/>
How much easier do you want it to be?  Part of the whole philosophy <br/>
of this game is NOT having everything spelled out in black and white.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your honesty Brian, and Phyto you were right on in your <br/>
response.<br/>

&gt; I don't consider this drivel of any kind. It's a person, new to <br/>
this hobbie,<br/>
&gt; potentially a great carver, hider, enthusiast, that wants to know. <br/>
Just<br/>
&gt; because a person has made their way to the chat list does NOT mean <br/>
they are<br/>
&gt; computer experts. As someone just the other day pointed out this is <br/>
an<br/>
&gt; OUTDOOR hobby. It is a hobby that appeals to people that like to <br/>
hike, solve<br/>
&gt; puzzles, and be OUTSIDE. No where in that description, or in any <br/>
description<br/>
&gt; I've EVER seen does being a computer expert show up. What in the <br/>
world does<br/>
&gt; it hurt for someone to say.. a hitchhiker is blah blah blah.. and <br/>
to find<br/>
&gt; out more take a look at this link. It takes someone what, about 3 <br/>
seconds.<br/>
&gt; Heck a discussion on hitchhikers might remind someone that's been <br/>
doing this<br/>
&gt; a while that he has a hitchhiker he needs to get on its way, or <br/>
that they<br/>
&gt; need to let the creator know it's been moved.. This is a hobby that <br/>
involves<br/>
&gt; people sharing a piece of themselves with others, which should be <br/>
done in a<br/>
&gt; safe and supportive manner.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Since the topic of "Lemony Snicket" has come up I thought I'd <br/>
throw<br/>
&gt;   my two cents in. Why a major buzz about these boxes hasn't <br/>
started on<br/>
&gt;   this list is just beyond me. When something worthwhile comes up it<br/>
&gt;   seems to be just passed by and overlooked, instead we get the same<br/>
&gt;   old drivel and questions that have all been answered in the past <br/>
or<br/>
&gt;   can be answered by simply doing a search of old posts or checking <br/>
out<br/>
&gt;   the FAQ section of the website. "What's a hitchhiker?" Why does <br/>
this<br/>
&gt;   question need to be addressed here when the answer to the <br/>
question is<br/>
&gt;   so readily available to anybody who has a serious yearning to <br/>
know.<br/>
&gt;   It's all right there in easily accessible areas, of not just the <br/>
main<br/>
&gt;   website, but also on various other sites such as "Silent Dougs" <br/>
great<br/>
&gt;   website. Maybe a few clicks of your mouse can answer these <br/>
questions<br/>
&gt;   in a lot more timely and considerate manner than posting them to <br/>
this<br/>
&gt;   list. As you know, I'm just a grumpy old man who has been "pissed<br/>
&gt;   off" about the way this game has been going in the past, and just <br/>
to<br/>
&gt;   let you all know, I ain't changing anytime in the near, or distant<br/>
&gt;   future. Why anybody would begin a post with the statement " I'm <br/>
sure<br/>
&gt;   this has been answered in the past" is in my eyes just idiotic. If<br/>
&gt;   you know it's been answered, go search for the answer, be self<br/>
&gt;   reliant, don't count on someone holding your hand and leading you<br/>
&gt;   along. Hell, that's the whole idea of letterboxing isn't it? Some <br/>
of<br/>
&gt;   the best and most sought after boxes never even make it to the <br/>
clue<br/>
&gt;   pages, you have to actually search for and discover these on your<br/>
&gt;   own. Which brings me back to the Lemony Snicket boxes, go find <br/>
these,<br/>
&gt;   yes, they can be troublesome as you actually have to search the<br/>
&gt;   messages here on the talklist for the clues instead of just easily<br/>
&gt;   looking on the webpage for what is new in your area. But,believe <br/>
me<br/>
&gt;   you, these boxes are well worth any extra effort you may have to <br/>
take<br/>
&gt;   on your part. The one we found in FL was magnificent and well <br/>
worth<br/>
&gt;   the battle we had with angry boars, gators, and armadillos. The <br/>
best<br/>
&gt;   box, with the best stamp, and the best logbook I've ever seen.<br/>

List etiquette and conventions are at:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html<br/>

<br/>
By following the indiacted link, you will find this advice:<br/>
<br/>
Policy: The list is not moderated... Newbie questions are most often <br/>
anwsered in the FAQ or archive; your best bet is to check there first <br/>
before posting, as the list is very high volume. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pretty clear if you ask me.  As for a newbie "not having time" to <br/>
check the FAQ and/or archives before asking questions -- so, what <br/>
instead they will waste everyone else's time?  If you don't have time <br/>
to educate yourself about the hobby and instead are expecting the <br/>
group to do it for you -- you have taken up the wrong hobby.<br/>

&gt; It's not drivel!! Many times people don't have the time to sit and <br/>
&gt; sift through the various files of the various websites devoted to <br/>
our <br/>
&gt; hobby! So they ask their questions when they join this list. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn't see a disclaimer on the group page when I considered <br/>
joining <br/>
&gt; this group that stated no one is allowed to ask the same question <br/>
&gt; twice, nor did I see a directive informing us that we are required <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; read the entire archives prior to posting any questions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So...sorry if you feel that this is all drivel and repetitive <br/>
&gt; questions to you but to many it is a goldmine of information. If <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; don't want to read the same stuff over and over..just hit the <br/>
delete <br/>
&gt; button...after all it's not like we all know who reads every single <br/>
&gt; post and who doesn't. I know that I hit the delete button lots and <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; fact I've been known to delete and entire digest because I don't <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; time. I can always go back to the group page if needed to find out <br/>
&gt; what everyone is ranting/raving about later on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also am aware that this is a huge group with many personalities <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; that sooner or later there will be disagreements. Hopefully the <br/>
&gt; majority of listmembers are mature enough to sit back and shake <br/>
their <br/>
&gt; collective heads as a minority makes absolute fools of themselves <br/>
&gt; nitpicking the smallest details over and over!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We all need to realize that sooner or later there will be the <br/>
&gt; opportunity to meet one another somewhere along the line and we <br/>
will <br/>
&gt; most likely have a somewhat preformed opinion about that person. <br/>
Most <br/>
&gt; likely directly caused/affected by our actions here on the list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course I've just probably put myself on the top of the flame <br/>
list <br/>
&gt; by even stooping to reply to this whole thread. Oh..well...I'll <br/>
just <br/>
&gt; hit the delete button a little more....its not like anyone would <br/>
know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; LOL,<br/>

all <br/>
&gt; been answered in the past or can be answered by simply doing a <br/>
search <br/>
&gt; of old posts or checking out the FAQ section of the <br/>
website. "What's <br/>

Wes you wrote:<br/>

&gt;   Now that we have list archives, maybe waiting two months is a little<br/>
extreme.<br/>
&gt; Maybe reading the last month's posts to familiarize yourself with the way<br/>
things<br/>
&gt; work would be sufficient.  Obviously, it depends on volume.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know Wes I actually did read the messages for about a month or so before<br/>
I joined this list so I could see how things worked.  It was quite<br/>
enlighting, so much so that I came within a hair's breath a couple of times<br/>
of swearing off letterboxing forever.<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons that I didn't was because I realized that very few<br/>
members of this group actually post a message here on the group itself and<br/>
they couldn't all be mean people.<br/>
<br/>
I mean do the math, at present there are 1655 members on this list<br/>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/), I do not believe I have ever<br/>
seen even 10% of those members post all at once.<br/>
<br/>
It would be interesting to see 165 newbie posts in one night, might give<br/>
some people heartburn.<br/>

&gt;  Which brings me back to the Lemony Snicket boxes,...... The one we <br/>
found in FL was magnificent and well worth <br/>
&gt; the battle we had with angry boars, gators, and armadillos. The <br/>
best <br/>
&gt; box, with the best stamp, and the best logbook I've ever seen.<br/>

That good, eh? That is saying a lot coming from someone accustomed to <br/>
the work of RTRW. <br/>
<br/>
I am not too surprised, given the quality of the clues. I remember <br/>
printing a copy of The Reptile Room when they were posted to show my <br/>
kids an example of a well concieved letterbox. It is like they were <br/>
pulled straight from the books.<br/>
<br/>
If I ever get to Florida I will have to handcuff the kids and go <br/>
looking for that one.<br/>

I have to echo you on that statement!  I have studied the clues and <br/>
the various LS websites, including that supposedly of the author, <br/>
and I am awed and impressed at the genious of these clues and the <br/>
authenticity of their mimicry.  I even ordered the first 6 books in <br/>
the series and cannot wait for a chance to delve into them.<br/>
<br/>
I wait on the edge of my seat for the next clue from the birlliant <br/>
Mr./Ms. Snicket, and am keeping my fingers crossed that the <br/>
locations will continue to traverse the country.<br/>
<br/>
Now this...  this is how the game should be played!<br/>
