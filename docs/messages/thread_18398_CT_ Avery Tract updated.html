shape, all are still there. Clues have been updated to reflect the <br/>
new color coded trails. If you've not been to these boxes, its a very <br/>
good place to spend a few hours!  <br/>
<br/>
If you HAVE been here, thank you for rehiding well. All of the boxes <br/>
were in excellent condition, hidden adequately, and the land has been <br/>
kept pristine. Thanks!!! <br/>
