Tumwater Falls Letterbox:  <br/>
<br/>
At the end of the ship's plank, is where you begin, head toward the <br/>
big (fenced) tank, the Chinook are kept in.  Walk around toward the <br/>
falls, oh my what a thrill!  Look for the totem pole and the <br/>
petroglyph near the building before you head down the hill.  Render <br/>
your respects to Old Glory, and continue on down, to a marker that <br/>
celebrates the 1st American colony settlers in town.  Continue to <br/>
the `arc-ed' bridge, which you'll cross when you may, follow along <br/>
the trail, toward the very distant Budd Bay.  Neat little path, <br/>
cross stepping stones you must, if the little box is a goal, in me <br/>
you need trust.  Head down to the trestle bridge, and cross with <br/>
great care, turn right to the steps and continue down if you dare.  <br/>
Look at the quiet lake, roaring falls and make a wish for good <br/>
luck.  Head back up the stairs and take the trail back toward the <br/>
park.  Over a boardwalk bridge ever so lightly do tread, for don't <br/>
worry, dear friend, your quest is just ahead.  Look for the `tree <br/>
stump seat', and oh, just beneath it, how neat?  Locate the box, <br/>
stamp in and say hi.  Be careful to rehide it when you're set to say <br/>
good-bye!<br/>

I apologize profusely for the poorly &amp; hastily carved replacement <br/>
stamp--in this case, the original was definitely much better than <br/>
the sequel!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm dvn2r ckr and I'm addicted to LBing, too.  At least this park is <br/>
one of those places WORTH returning to (I forewarn you that the <br/>
stamp is very poor this time around--I was running off of less than <br/>
2 hours of sleep before we headed down there)!  We've visited the <br/>
park at least 5 times in the past 3 weeks (and we spent one of those <br/>
weeks on the East Coast).  The salmon were running up it like mad a <br/>
week ago and it was such great entertainment for the kids.  I think <br/>
the gardener came across this box, too.  They had cut the pesky ivy <br/>
away and must've come across the box in the process.  At least, they <br/>
had the presence of mind to attempt to rehide the box along the way <br/>
and did a fantastic professional letterboxer job in their <br/>
attempt!!!  Unfortunately, somebody made off with the 'nicer' stamp <br/>
before then.  :( <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your trip to the park, that's the true prize in the <br/>
process!!!  We saw a few chinook in the area but nothing like the <br/>
run a week and a half ago!  There are roe all over the place, <br/>
though.  Keep your eyes open for little surprises along the way!<br/>
