<br/>
As we are in the midst of consumptiual consumerism in the days after<br/>
Thanksgiving, I propose a NEW (that's right NEW, never before seen on TV!)<br/>
branch of letterboxing. . .  MALLERBOXING!<br/>
<br/>
You see, you approach a store in a mall and tell them about MALLERBOXING<br/>
which is just like letterboxing except in the safe, indoor, no poo on your<br/>
nice mall-walking shoes, no hiking boots, no bugs, weather-free, fresh-air<br/>
free mall. These MALLERBOXES will bring more people into their stores. The<br/>
stamp of course would be the store logo (GAP, Lord and Taylor, Spencers,<br/>
Cinnabun, etc.) and the journal could have a few bonus coupons or something<br/>
too, maybe an ad for a special sale item. The box will be placed in an area<br/>
where they have prime merchandise of course.<br/>
<br/>
The store will pay you to have the box placed and maintained, maybe $75.<br/>
KAH-CHING in your pocket for MALLERBOXING.<br/>
<br/>
Than you go around to all the stores to have boxes placed. Than you make a<br/>
web site . . . MALLERBOXING.ORG or MALLQUEST.COM - for the international<br/>
boxes once this really takes off.  You would of course get the stores who<br/>
have boxes placed in them to pay for an ad on the web site. More KA-CHING in<br/>
your pocket.<br/>
<br/>
Who says you can't make money off of letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
Anybody who does this idea (or some horrible variation) will be banished<br/>
from all letterboxing activities and letterboxing web sites, and if we ever<br/>
find you at an event (hmmmm... a MALLERBOXING EVENT? . . . ) you will be<br/>
pummeled with all the dog poo that is stuck on our well-worn, mud-covered<br/>
hiking shoes.<br/>

Indeed our dear Randalstik must surely be delirious with fever. Her<br/>
Ladyship couldn't possibly think of a more vulgar and crass<br/>
commercialization of an egalitarian outdoor activity. No need to<br/>
collect any poo to fling at her Ladyship, there's not a chance in the<br/>

Pray, dear teacher, do not be overly distraught over condition of poor Randelstik. I am quite convinced that this delirium was brought on by an overdose of tofurkey which, if I recall correctly, was never mentioned in the "Holiday Dining, l01 (or 102)" at Lady Prisspot's School for Pristeens.<br/>

I already have two boxes that are pretty close to<br/>
this.  They are in stores with permission of the<br/>
owner, and the rubberstamp is a rendering of the store<br/>
logo.  I plan to do more as soon as I can find more<br/>
stores that are appropriate (quaint little knickknack<br/>
stores are perfect) with owners that are agreeable and<br/>
logos that are carvable.<br/>
<br/>
Didn't charge any money, though.  I was happy enough<br/>
they were willing to host my letterbox and keep an eye<br/>
on it for me.<br/>
