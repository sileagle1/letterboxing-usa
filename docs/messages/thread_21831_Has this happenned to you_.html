We checked the log book in one of our boxes and found it had been <br/>
stamed with an HH that we had found in Maine and brought to MA and <br/>
placed rather far away from home. Very neat to see it a second time <br/>
still travelling around so now we have it in our personal journals and <br/>
one of our log books as well...<br/>
