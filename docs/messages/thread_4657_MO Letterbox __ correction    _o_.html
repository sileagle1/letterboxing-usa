The cache is a (roughly) Harry Potter themed cache. The Fort ZumWalt Park <br/>
(just off of Veterans' Memorial Parkway) and the cache are great for the <br/>
kids! So bring the kids and after you find the cache, go explore the <br/>
"castle". As of 3/7/02 this cache is also a letterboxing cache! Enjoy! Thanks <br/>

<br/>
One day, Jared was visiting with Harry before a Quidditch match. "Oh no!" <br/>
said Harry, in the middle of the conversation, "I forgot to retrieve my lucky <br/>
magic ring!" He looked at Jared, "Could you go and find it for me if I give <br/>
you the clues?" Jared replied, "Certainly, Harry!" Harry sighed in relief, <br/>
"Thank you, Jared, this very scroll you are reading provides you with enough <br/>
clues to find my secret wizard cache. Just take your wand and say the magic <br/>
words -Jeepy-ess- and your wand will lead you to my hidden wizard cache. Once <br/>
you are there, you may need a spell or the help of a friendly giant to move <br/>
the stone that marks the hiding spot."<br/>
So, Jared set out on his adventure. His wand led him to the enchanted forest <br/>
near the Lake of Whetsel. Inside the forest, he followed his wand. Along the <br/>
way, he saw the towers of a nearby castle, "Hmmm" Jared thought, "I'll have <br/>
to go explore the castle, it's just over the creek and across the roadway at <br/>
the top of that hill (NE). But first, I'll have to find Harry's secret wizard <br/>
cache." Lo and behold it was not long before he found the spot. Fortunately, <br/>
Jared asked a giant friend of his to accompany him, and the stone was easily <br/>
moved, revealing the hidden cache. "Hooray!" shouted Jared as he recovered <br/>
Harry's magic ring. Before he left, Jared decided that he would pass Harry's <br/>
clues to others and leave many prizes for others to find. So, now the clues <br/>
are yours; will you find Harry's Secret Wizard Cache?<br/>
