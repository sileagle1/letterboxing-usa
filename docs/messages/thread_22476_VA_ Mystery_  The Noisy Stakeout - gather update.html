11:01pm<br/>
<br/>
I was keeping the Boddy mansion under close survelience.  Trying to lay low and keep quiet to avoid discovery.  I don't know why I bothered. <br/>
<br/>
"Ow! Dang sticker bushes. I should never have given up my day job."<br/>
<br/>
"Hush. Please keep it down over there."<br/>
<br/>
"Me? Keep it dow... hey, these are my sticker bushes. Go find your own pesky thorns. Who the heck are you anyway," I grumbled.<br/>
<br/>
"Bond. James Bond.[stamp by Yuri Nahl]  Don't be A Study in Scarlet [by Sewsoobizzy] and hand me that shaker will you please."  <br/>
<br/>
"Some stake out this is."<br/>
<br/>
"Hey mister. Do you know where the next trail marker is?"<br/>
<br/>
"Aren't you kids supposed to be in school or something?!"<br/>
<br/>
"We're doing the kids scavenger hunt at the Mystery! gather while our folks are boxing. We're looking for The Cat Who... Hid in a Letterbox." [by Ladybug]<br/>
<br/>
"Get lost ya little monsters. And that's not part of your scavenger hunt anyway. This isn't a quiet stake out, it's a busman's convention."  <br/>
<br/>
"When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth," said an old fashioned voice.  <br/>
<br/>
"Who's the guy in the natty suit, pipe, and funny hat?" I whispered..<br/>
<br/>
"Deerstalker," Bond replied. "You mean...?"  "Yes."  [Sherlock Holmes by Chuck Straub]<br/>
<br/>
I gave up the night and headed back for a scotch.  "There are so many detectives here in this woods you can walk across the channel on them. I think I'll go out for a steak."<br/>

- Stamps from all over on a Mystery! detective theme.<br/>
- Clue Exchange Game - "Death of a Salesman" on a product logo theme.<br/>
- kids scavenger hunt<br/>
- prizes<br/>
<br/>
"Hey Bond, aren't you a spy? I thought this was a detective show?" "Spies, mysterys, detectives. We're all alike. Shadows, running, gunshots, you know."<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly out of the shadows I heard running.  Then shots.  Blang, blang!<br/>
