about seeking boxes!  Mansfield:  While following clues to Chuck and <br/>
Molly's "Spring heeled Jack" l.b. I met letterboxers Bill and Craig. <br/>
The black bag of supplies and intent staring at the huge rock <br/>
formation (clue) by the side of the trail gave me away, for sure.  <br/>
They were just returning from being the very first stampers-<br/>
inners!    We exchanged stamps and I proceded on to be the second <br/>
stamper in at a typically well executed l.b. by Chuck and Molly.  <br/>
then on to the "Bunyip of Billabong" lb., part of Chuck and Molly's <br/>
In Search Of series.  What an adorable creature despite his bad <br/>
reputation.<br/>
  East Haddam/Haddam: I finally got to the Drew's "Ct. Yankee" l.b. <br/>
smack dab across the river from my hometown of Haddam Neck. Logbook <br/>
soaked and full. I dried things out, left blank journal pages and <br/>
will mail the logbook to the Drew clan once it finishes drying out on <br/>
my radiator.  On to a new favorite stamp! "The Grinch in CT." had all <br/>
of the finest elements a letterboxer could want:  Awesome colorful <br/>
stamp, creative poetic clues and a handmade stamp pouch and logbook <br/>
to boot. Be sure to vist if at all possible. While at Gilette's <br/>
Castle, I met a family of brand new letterboxers stamping in at the <br/>
first box of the Drew Clan's "Sherlock's Home" series. They <br/>
graciously allowed me to tag along as we hunted down the second in <br/>
this series. Both logbooks are chockablock full.  We stamped on one <br/>
of the sheets someone else placed in the book .  Happy letterboxing!<br/>
          Cat lover/teacher/gardener. Now it's time to count up my <br/>
finds..looking towards 300th find:-) <br/>
