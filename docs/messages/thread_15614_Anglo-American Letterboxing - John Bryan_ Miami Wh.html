                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finished my first letterboxing excursion on this side of the Atlantic <br/>
and found my first American Letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
I went with my friend Gale (some of you know her) to Ohio. I spent <br/>
the whole journey from Indinapolis to John Bryan State Park <br/>
translating Shavian clues!!  After two hours I was pretty much <br/>
fluent. Anyway, translated clues in hand we set off into John Bryan <br/>
for a bit of frog hunting.  And we found a few of the little <br/>
critters.  A few were elusive though, but on the whole they seem <br/>
quite happy hiding under rocks and in trees.  Them there tree frogs <br/>
are tricksters.<br/>
<br/>
Moved on later that day to East Fork and found quite a few more.  <br/>
It's nice to see a lot of familiar names in the log books.  And to <br/>
see we were following the same path as a few have trod (although not <br/>
necessarily in the same order)<br/>
<br/>
Finally moved on to Miami White Water and did a few of the trails <br/>
there.  The Harry Potter series is one of my favourites so far. (Well <br/>
done ScoutDogs)<br/>
<br/>
So 26 boxes over two days.  Not too shabby at all. And the weather <br/>
just made it a perfect couple of days.  I will post some pictures on <br/>
my website at some point (once I get back to the UK), but don't want <br/>
to give extra clues or anything.  www.drawbridge.org.uk<br/>
<br/>
So, for those that are interested (and to let you know the ones we <br/>
think are missing), here's a list....<br/>
<br/>
All three Valley of the Frogs boxes (Genesis)<br/>
All three Proto Tree Frogs boxes<br/>
Two Valley of the Frogs Episode 5 (no luck finding box #1)<br/>
Proto Cave Frogs - Valley of the Frogs Episode 3 (couldn't <br/>
find "chest high")<br/>
USMC Team Jedi<br/>
Up a Tree<br/>
Nine Eleven<br/>
In Flight<br/>
Little Lady<br/>
Zoo Box<br/>
Raccoon Ridge<br/>
East Fork<br/>
Happy 2003<br/>
All four Harry Potter Series in MWW<br/>
Colorful Castle Pileated?<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I'm counting the stamp in the John Bryan Visitor centre <br/>
too.  On Dartmoor a lot of boxes can be found in pubs and museums and <br/>
shops and visitor centres and they are all counted as true boxes, <br/>
even though you don't have to go traipsing over moors amongst sheep <br/>
droppings and putting your hand in spider and/or snake infested holes <br/>
to find them.<br/>
<br/>
We had a wonderful time.  Thank you all that suggested the places to <br/>
visit.  I'm sorry we couldn't meet any of you.<br/>
Thank you America for making my trip even more special.<br/>
<br/>
Look out for out signatures in the books.  A Crown for Beau (Gale) <br/>
and a dragonfly for me - DrawbridgeP<br/>
<br/>
I WILL be back.<br/>
