<br/>
The first was completely waterlogged.  Have taken it to do some first-<br/>
aid.  I have an email out to Flyfisher, but haven't heard back.  The <br/>
logbook is almost completely illegible (although I could read <br/>
something from a CT letterboxer and a few others), so it will be <br/>
replaced.  I will also put a new inkpad in it.  I hope to have it <br/>
back in its hiding spot sometime this week.<br/>
<br/>
The second is in good shape.  There was no rock covering it, so I <br/>
lugged one up from the creek.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, the clues for these boxes take you to the first bridge then <br/>
proceed across the bridge from there.  When I got to the road leading <br/>
to the first bridge, I encountered a "Road Closed" sign.  You can get <br/>
to the parking spot at the bridge just fine, but the bridge itself is <br/>
closed.  So, if you want to do these, bring a map to find a detour to <br/>
the second box!<br/>
