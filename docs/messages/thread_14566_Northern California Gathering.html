So far we have commitments for 10 boxes at Kennedy Grove, with "maybes" from 2 <br/>

<br/>
I would like to introduce the "You've Got Mail" mailbox at the No. CA <br/>
gathering. The mailbox will be a drop-off, and/or pick-up for HHs. It <br/>
will be left on one of the picnic tables for all to enjoy exchanging <br/>
HH stamps, etc. This is the standard, average size US mailbox, which <br/>
in the future will be hidden somewhere in the East Bay area. So, <br/>
bring your HH for an exchange.  <br/>
