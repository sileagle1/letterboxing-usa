<br/>
The clues mention mound 72 ... When we found it we didn't use the GPS.  We <br/>
just used a map from the museum and the clues.  So,yes.  <br/>
  My understanding was that if there is a stamp and log book and clues (even <br/>
if they are just coordinates), then it is a letterbox.  Is that incorrect?    <br/>
A geocache requires coordinates but not necessarily a cache (despite the <br/>
name).  :o)<br/>

It is a letterbox, at least that is what the FAQ says (and since I wrote<br/>
the FAQ, I think I agree :-))<br/>
<br/>
I guess we all have to decide what is and is not a duck for ourselves,<br/>

a letterbox -- I think the stamp and the logbook do seem to be <br/>
requirements, at least to most people).<br/>
<br/>
(As an aside, I have yet to read a geocaching clue that requires a<br/>
GPS to find -- that doesn't mean there aren't any of course, but <br/>
even if they do require that tool, big deal.  Some of my boxes<br/>
require use of the GNIS database or antique maps, for example, <br/>
for you to have any chance at all.  Those who do not have access <br/>
to, or dislike, the best tools to find the box have other <br/>
opportunities ... either in other boxes or alternative tools).<br/>

&gt; The problem is that geocachers take the stamp!  I had this problem<br/>
&gt; when I found a geocache/letterbox in St. Louis.  I found the thing<br/>
&gt; and it had a lot of junk in it!  But NO Stamp. <br/>
<br/>
I suppose that is a risk of listing them as combinations.  They<br/>
can become un-letterboxes pretty quickly.  Perhaps the thing to<br/>
do is remove the junk from the next geocache and replace it<br/>
with a stamp :-)<br/>

Amanda,  Sorry your hunt wasn't successful for you. :o(   .   We visited the <br/>
Forest Park Pentacache  (even though it was not hidden by us) after your note <br/>
and did find the stamp in the box but among the geocache stash items ... it <br/>
was carved on a red and yellow eraser.  <br/>
  Usually we don't loose the stamp to geocachers .... Our boxes are always <br/>
heavily laden with requests not to take the stamp ... It is for letterboxers <br/>
to stamp up with.  We have even gained quiet a few new letterboxers from the <br/>
geocache side of the hunt by hiding combo boxes.  :o)<br/>
  We have lost more contents to not properly closed ziplocks and containers <br/>
than anything else.  I think hunters should also  cnsider washing their hands <br/>
before handling a letterbox if they have just eaten or smoke, especially <br/>
cigars!  :o)<br/>
Raccoons must love the smell of cigars!  I can count on losing a box or have <br/>
animal chew marks on it after a certain cigar smoking boxer visits one of our <br/>
boxes. :o(<br/>
