fox landing...And I could have not done letterboxing anyway but n my <br/>
curiosity (being a teenager, i have lots of curiosity,don`t all teenagers) I <br/>
checked and there were only two letterboxes in catalina,(I believe it is <br/>
still that way I have to check,altough it probably is.)Anyways there should <br/>
be more, I wanted tohide one at fox landing,but I thought it is a camp in <br/>
which you are so busy that you couldn't have time to find a letterbx,I went <br/>
there for marine SCI,We did NOT HIKE! Anyway I encourage people all over The <br/>
United States, the USA to hide letterboxes in or about Catalina <br/>
Island.....May the fish be with you! 2+<br/>
