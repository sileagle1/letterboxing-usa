were checking up on our Herrick Lake box today, they surprised us <br/>
with just this greeting.  If we weren't stunned into stupefication, <br/>
we might have shot back a snappy response of some sort, but oh well.  <br/>
It struck me as a very good way of breaking the ice without having <br/>
the preamble of explaining what letterboxing is, where it came from, <br/>
and why on God's green earth you do it.  Depending on the degree of <br/>
curiosity on the face of the individual, you could take a deep breath <br/>
and follow up with the preamble, or you could just say "Sorry.  Never <br/>
mind."  There's also a wide variety of off-putting crackpot comments <br/>
at your disposal, too, if you're so inclined. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...we'd never met fellow LBers before (since there are probably <br/>
about 5 of them in IL), and so it was a pleasant surprize to meet <br/>
someone else with this mania.  Nice folks.<br/>

That's so funny, because this JUST happened to me today!  Was out letterboxing on the other side of the state, papers and compass in hand, muttering about my, I believe the words were, "Mule headed husband who doesn't listen to me about clues even though I'm always right" (he'd insisted a trail we needed to take wasn't the right one), and I passed a man going the way I'd come from.  He asked me if I was looking for something, and I, still in the heat of a one-sided conversation with my husband, and not wanting to reveal a letterbox to someone who wasn't looking for it, said, "No, no thanks."<br/>
<br/>
Turns out that very nice man was the owner of the box we were looking for!  We met up with him again, and exchanged stamps.  Now that I know the secret phrase, (and I do like "Are you looking for what I'm looking for?")  I'll be able to answer (and ask) correctly!<br/>
