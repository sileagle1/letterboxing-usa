<div>COME TO THE DOG SCOUTS OF AMERICA THREE 
DAY LETTERBOXING AND GEOCACHING EVENT!</div>
<div align="center">(please cross-post this 
information)</div>
<div align="center"> </div>
<div><strong>WHAT:</strong>  We are planning an 
event in Michigan, tentatively in the Muskegon area, which will include 
everything you always wanted to know about letterboxing and geocaching with your 
dog!</div>
<div><strong>WHEN:</strong>  November 9-10-11 
(Veteran's Day weekend) Saturday will be Geocaching seminar/searches, Sunday 
will be letterboxing seminar/searches &amp; Monday will be open for both 
activities</div>
<div><strong>WHERE:</strong>  Muskegon (?)  
Close enough to Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, all parts of Michigan, and Chicago, 
too!</div>
<div><strong>WHY:</strong>  We want to teach 
everyone how to do letterboxing/geocaching in their own area--it's a great 
excuse to get outdoors with your dog and have fun!</div>
<div><strong>WHO:</strong>  This is for 
everyone!  All dog owners (&amp; dog owner wanna be's) are invited, so 
share this information with your dog friends and other dog clubs (please 
cross-post).</div>
<div><strong>COST:</strong>  FREE for DSA 
members!  Free for Dog Scouts!  $20.00 fee for non-members for the 
seminars, fun, games, and competitions .  (We will probably charge a 
materials fee of about $5.00 or so, to help us defray costs of 
providing you with a "getting started" kit, if you are new to this fun 
activity).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By the end of this weekend, we will have completed 
the following:</div>
<div>Learn how to enjoy letterboxing (orienteering with 
a twist) with our dog(s): get clues, follow compass headings, find letterboxes, 
carve our own stamps, put together and plant letterboxes  see <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org">www.letterboxing.org</a> for more 
info</div>
<div>Learn how to enjoy geocaching withour dogs: get 
coordinates, use a GPS (Global Positioning System) computer, find caches 
with a GPS, put together and plant geocaches see <a href="http://www.geocaching.com">www.geocaching.com</a> for more 
info</div>
<div>Have fun playing skill-building games to help us 
with our searching, box-building and planting skills.</div>
<div>Participate in contests and win prizes that will 
help us on our way to being experienced letterboxers/geocachers.</div>
<div>Complete the requirements for the new Letterboxing 
1 and parts of the Letterboxing 2 merit badges!  </div>
<div>Complete the requirements for the new Geocaching 1 
and parts of the Geocaching 2 merit badges!</div>
<div>You'll be finding at least 5 letterboxes and 5 
geocaches and planting one of each over the weekend.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What to bring:</div>
<div>Your Dog, leash, collar, backpack, hi-vis bandana 
or other visable clothing (read: Orange)</div>
<div>Your Dog's stamp and geocache trade 
items</div>
<div>A dish to pass for Saturday evening 
dinner</div>
<div>Your letterboxing stuff (if you don't have your 
"stuff" yet, you can get it at the event, but here's a list of stuff you'll 
need):</div>
<div>Stamp (ink) pad</div>
<div>Rubber Stamp (your own personal one that you will 
use to "sign in" at the letterboxes you find)</div>
<div>Pen or Pencil</div>
<div>Compass</div>
<div>Your own log book (small notebook with unlined 
pages to log the stamps you "collect")</div>
<div>Stuff for building a letterbox (this will be in 
your kit if you pay the materials fee:  Small resealable waterproof plastic 
container, log book, pen/pencil, stamp pad, stamp, large and small zip loc 
baggies)</div>
<div>Your Geocaching stuff (if you don't have the stuff, 
you can get it there, and you can share a GPS with someone)  Besides a GPS, 
you'll need "trade" items to leave in geocache boxes when you take something 
out.</div>
<div>Stuff for building a geocache (this will be in your 
kit if you pay the materials fee:  Medium resealable waterproof container, 
an assortment of trade items, small lined notebook for log, pen/pencil, large 
and small zip loc baggies)  </div>
<div>A bag to keep all your "stuff" in.  (the dog 
is required to carry the stuff in his pack to get the merit badge, so think 
"pack size" when you select a bag.  I keep my letterbox materials in one of 
those zippered 3-ring notebook pencil holders.  I keep my geocache trade 
items in a little Dog Scout canvas bag (which would also fit in my dog's 
pack--but I usually just take a few items at a time).</div>
<div>Your own personal camping equipment or overnite bag 
for the motel stay.</div>
<div>Warm clothing (high visibility clothing, 
preferably)</div>
<div>Your own food and snacks for the 
weekend.</div>
<div>If you have a set of exacto knives or a linoleum 
carving tool, that will be very handy for the stamp carving class.  Large 
nylon erasers or PZ-Cut would be handy to have, too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>WHAT ELSE?:</strong>  We're planning 
some really fun games and contests with really cool prizes.  If your dog is 
a scout, you can pay the badge fee and get checked out for this badge 
on this weekend.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Please let us know in 
advance if you are coming</strong>.  We need to know how many people 
to plan for.  To sign up for this event, please contact Lonnie via phone or 
email:  989 389-2000 <a href="mailto:lonnie@dogscouts.com">lonnie@dogscouts.com</a>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We want this event to be HUGE.  We couldn't 
contain ourselves until warmer weather.  You guys are going to LOVE this 
activity.  It is very relaxing and truly addicting, and your dog will love 
the time you spend with him or her.  This info will be in the DSA 
newsletter, but the newsletter may not arrive in time for you to get this 
information.</div>
