<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm okay with a compass, but not fabulous.  
So, if it's simple directions ("walk 40 paces NNE," for example), I'm 
fine.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If it's going to get technical ("face 137.5 degrees 
and turn slowly to look at what Nature has provided at exactly 97.1415 
degrees"), I appreciate some additional landmarks ("look for the big tree with 
the pink polka dots, with a triangular rock at its base").</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Of course, I've looked for nine letterboxes and 
found seven so far (I believe that Two Hearts/Lincoln, MA and Adam's 
Point/Durham, NH are missing), I'm not exactly a world authority. *grin*  
But I'm probably representative of the average newbie.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That's my two cents.  Or degrees of insight, 
anyway.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cheerfully,</div>

I think the compass adds something to the "hunt".  I like it best when<br/>
there are both compass bearings and trail information (such as: head 330<br/>
degrees (or NNW) 14 paces to the 2 dead trees) so I don't have to rely on<br/>
only one clue to get where I am going. Since I happen to letterbox with my<br/>
9 year old son, it also lends an educational aspect to our search, and also<br/>
makes the search a little more interesting for older children.  Once we did<br/>
forget the compass, but luckily it was a sunny day and in the afternoon. So<br/>
we relied on the sun and figured out the degrees with a pencil and a circle<br/>
and found our way anyway. Even though its a little thing, it made me feel<br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
I don't mind boxes without the compass bearings though. I enjoy walking<br/>
through the woods, and this hobby/sport is a wonderful way to get us out<br/>
and discovering what's around us!<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting!<br/>

Hi there,<br/>
RE: Compass useage.<br/>
<br/>
We love it. It adds another demension. However, we<br/>
still like a clue or two such as the "big tree" or the<br/>
"fallen down stone wall" to double check ourselves.<br/>
Vinnnie the dog does very well on the compass.<br/>
 :-)<br/>
Always fun.....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a thought about compass usage ..and how it is in the UK<br/>
<br/>
There is really not any clue I have ever seen for Dartmoor which didn't<br/>
have a whole host of cross bearings...<br/>
<br/>
As to accuracey of the measure, well they are on the whole very good...<br/>
<br/>
Lets be real though... no-one would use less than half a degree. <br/>
<br/>
Less than half a degree is just not readable !<br/>
<br/>
I must say that bearings from multiple points are part and parcel of the<br/>
clue...I wonder how you can determine a "fix" without at least three ?<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate that there are big differences between clues in the UK and<br/>
the US..Dartmoor Letterboxers don't give the copious directions that LbNA<br/>
members are used to seeing..<br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple of  typical UK Dartmoor clues...<br/>
<br/>
Monarch Butterfly	   67** 73**<br/>
Lone tree in field 26  Corndorn Tor highest point 80   <br/>
Another obvious nose shaped rock on Yar 333 White Gable End 355<br/>
<br/>
Babbling Brooks 3 - Snowdon Brook<br/>
(680 678)<br/>
Hollys on brook 331 &amp; 350, church tower 98, church spire 106, nearest<br/>
dead tree stump 165 <br/>
Box in split of rock high above brook LHS going up<br/>
__________________________________<br/>
<br/>
For the technically minded:<br/>
<br/>
The 67 73 and 680 678 bit are a "grid reference". <br/>
This is the UK mapping standard (called OS) <br/>
..you can use your GPS for this..<br/>
<br/>
It will locate the boxes to being within a grid square ..<br/>
These are sized 1 kilometre by 1 kilometre for Monarch Butterfly..<br/>
and 100 metres by 100 metres for Snowdon Brook (about 100yds by 100yds)<br/>
respectively!<br/>
<br/>
Easy eh !<br/>
<br/>
Without a compass you'd be lost I fear !<br/>
<br/>
For the very technical..and if  my grid system maths holds up ..<br/>
The second box is approx.1 km East and just over 5 km South of the first<br/>
shown here.<br/>
<br/>
The only problem I have is that I have no idea what a kilometre is <grin> <br/>
___________________________________<br/>

Finally though....I can't imagine anyone going out into the wild without a<br/>
compass..?<br/>
