<div>Bring a flashlight to guide your feet, the path 
is smooth  and secrets of the night deep. </div>

A  Night on Lebanon  Green</div>
<div> </div>
<div>   Park  at the Brick church on 
the side of the church where the shadow of the steeple falls ,2 with wheels plus 
10.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Stand so a lit Betsy is on your far right , a dark Betsy near 
right and the barn where George Washington's horse slept on your 
left.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Leave the church behind, head into the darkness on a path 
smooth and stony.The  moon is behind you and a great many stars line the 
dome overhead.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>" There's a call for troops sir"  They've 
started a war at some place outside of Boston , called Bunker Hill!" 
</div>
<div>  " Gather the militia on the green we will  
muster there before  dawn tommorow."</div>
<div>Pass by five stately trees  who in their infancy may of 
heard such words uttered beneath their branches.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>" Sir,  General Washington requests provisions for 
the troops gathered east of the great river."</div>
<div> " We will meet at the usual place, 
send a rider see if Mr. Huntington will join us." </div>
<div>" This office will see 
many a meeting before  George and his taxes are history."</div>
<div>Pass the evergreens spaced on the 
right.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Stay on this path toward a beacon in the 
street.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>" Psst, I hear a carriage approaching, get up..." 
" Halt! Who goes there? "</div>
<div>" Evening boys, it is only I ,Dr. Bixby, a late 
night  and a new patriot to show for it. I'll be heading  on 
home  now, only a little sleep  before I meet with  the Govenor 
for breakfast , he'll be heading back to Hartford tommorow. " " You 
may pass sir. "</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The street beacon draws closer and now the fascade of the 
Lebanon Baptist Church comes into view far in the distance. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>" General Washinton, how do you think the troops will do 
this coming winter?"</div>
<div>   " The winter will test our 
resolve for freedom from tyranny, it will be with courage and  good 
provisions that we pass through  with the strength to defeat the 
Brittish.  Their camps grow in number and the ships bring more Hessians and 
provisions each day. Pray now for  a great many beasts will be sacrificed 
to feed the soldiers gathered in the name of Liberty." </div>
<div>" Saint Francis , we 
see your guiding light,  hear General Washinton and  provide for these 
men, Amen. "</div>
<div> </div>
<div>" A rider comes sir!"</div>
<div>" I hear the   hoofbeats, the horse is tired 
and   straining, the ride has been long."</div>
<div>" Sir ,  Greetings from  General Rochambeau of 
the French Army, he sends you word that his troops are now camped at a place 
called Bolton near the great notch in the rocks. They will march with haste 
toward Windham tommorow. He will ride on ahead to meet with you at dawn, he 
presumes that Mr. Huntington has been sent for. "</div>
<div> " Great news , thank-you, set a camp for yourself 
by that windbreak to the right , pines and decidous trees will take the bite out 
of this chill wind."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Two small gaurds stand to the left, you may pass them at 
will."</div>
<div>The beacon is in the distance ,one passed another comes, but 
we will not reach it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>March by the ten great ones in a row then two babies . 
</div>
<div>Now  the  path is darkest, dim light  from 
windows on the  left, if anyone is home , must be quiet here for they stand 
gaurd over  all you hold dear.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now  to the right and hidden in the core of Johnny's 
legacy your goal!</div>
<div>Take it to your car to stamp, up the way you came or around 
the greens tip and up the other side. With luck you will see a shooting star as 
I did. Or maybe hear the voices of the past echo  down the 
green.</div>
<div>After you stamp  drive down the green, stop your car, put 
a signal on, hop out and replant the treasure as you found it. Be sure it is 
covered with natures blanket. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Sir , I hear they  voted General Washinton as 
President." </div>
<div>" Yes that's right he proved a great leader in the war 
and will lead us well as a   nation. Many a time he came here  to 
meet and plan  for our safety. How long will these freedoms stand, what 
will time  remember of the deeds of these great men who gathered here, only 
time will tell, only time will tell......." </div>
