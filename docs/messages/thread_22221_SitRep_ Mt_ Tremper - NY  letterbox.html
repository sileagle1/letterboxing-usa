J &amp; G (me)  just climbed to the top of this mountain to check on the LB<br/>
this 4th of July and found the LB to be in good shape. A few of the "give<br/>
away"  maps  found new homes so the next time we will have to restock<br/>
with more. Placed four "Special Maps" (the ones that are made for the<br/>
Overlook Hotel" area in the letterbox. Will have to make it back up there<br/>
in the Fall again. We made it up there in about 1.5 hours.<br/>
	Only PHYSTER sticks in my mind for the LB hits because she have been<br/>
there about one year age on 7/03/04 and I am sorry to say I did not<br/>
recall any of the others because we were hurried into replacing the LB in<br/>
it's hiding spot inside that tree!  About 25 or more people made it to<br/>
the top shortly after we got there so it was a quick check looking at the<br/>
stamp-ins and then a quick rehide.<br/>
	Out friend "the budster" stayed cool at home in the valley far below.  <br/>
The trip would be too hot and humid for him to handle. He's a cold<br/>
weather dog. The days are past when he climbed up to the top of that<br/>
mountain. Maybe in the Fall , when I have a lot of time, I will bring him<br/>
to the top of Overlook, and then cart him back down. It's tough to be<br/>
blind and deaf  and in your 80's (in dog years) He probably will have no<br/>
problem hiking to the Hotel because he knews he gets feed there. And when<br/>
he gets there and is feed  he probably will not  want to move anymore.<br/>
Kind of like how I get on a full stomach. Ha!<br/>
