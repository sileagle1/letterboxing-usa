&gt;meeting" attachment that I sent out yesterday?  A coiuple had problems, <br/>
&gt;others went thru OK<br/>

&gt;LETTERBOXING<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Name: "One by Land, One by Sea"<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Placed by : Friends of Mansfield Hollow<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Location: Mansfield/North Windham<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Rated: Moderate, (easy if you know the area!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This can be found in two ways--by water in a canoe, kayak or fishing boat, <br/>
&gt;by land from a parking lot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Mansfield Hollow is a huge area, fed by three rivers and divided into <br/>
&gt;sections according to the DEP's use: this section is open to hunting, and <br/>
&gt;part of the Field Trail Area for hunting dogs. Be aware that on many <br/>
&gt;weekends it will be in use by the field trail folks, and that during the <br/>
&gt;hunting season walkers must be cautious. Sunday is a good day--no hunting <br/>
&gt;allowed. With all that said, it's one of our favorite spots for exploring <br/>
&gt;and admiring a place emptied of residents by flood control<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;By land: heading east on route 6 in North Windham turn left at intersection <br/>
&gt;of 203(traffic light). A sign points to Mansfield Hollow. Cross the bridge <br/>
&gt;over the Natchaug River and immediately take a left on N. Windham Rd. In .3 <br/>
&gt;mile park in dirt lot at the yellow gate. Go back, pass the gate, walk down <br/>
&gt;the old paved road (closed in 1949), down hill, then up. On the right, when <br/>
&gt;the foliage is off, there is an old barn foundation. At the top of the hill <br/>
&gt;the road follows an esker, with land dropping off on each side-another <br/>
&gt;glacial sign--a kettle hole down on the left. On the right is the remains <br/>
&gt;of a retaining wall built by some roads crew long ago. Now is the time to <br/>
&gt;look carefully for a cart path turning to the left; turn here, follow to <br/>
&gt;the edge of the river. There is an open space here, and signs of a <br/>
&gt;well-worn path along the banks (save this for another day). A ghostly <br/>
&gt;fireplace stands in the clearing; look for evidence that once there was a <br/>
&gt;lean-to built into it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, stand with your back to the fireplace, with your left shoulder toward <br/>
&gt;the river; take out your compass, set it at 340 degrees. Step off 30 <br/>
&gt;steps/15 paces toward a big oak tree that resembles a fielder's mitt. (4 <br/>
&gt;fingers, one dead), circle it, look in the pocket where the box may be <br/>
&gt;found. Cover me up well--lots of pine needles etc. nearby, say goodbye, go <br/>
&gt;back to the paved road. Right back to your car.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you want a different way back, cross the paved road to a rough path--it <br/>
&gt;will take you up and down, back past that old barn foundation to the <br/>
&gt;parking lot. Warning--lots of brush, thorns and briars. It's used by the <br/>
&gt;dog trail folks, but is a favorite of mine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, By Sea:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Put your boat in at the boat launch, head south past the beach area where <br/>
&gt;the Canoe club hangs out, keep to the left (eastern) shore. You are in the <br/>
&gt;widest part of the lake, but soon will curve left, with the dike on your <br/>
&gt;right, and enter the Natchaug River. Continue to follow the left bank--you <br/>
&gt;will see that it is high, covered with pine trees. The river makes a <br/>
&gt;gradual curve to the left, then to the right, and looks the way the river <br/>
&gt;must have pre-flood control. Watch carefully for two large, dead trees, <br/>
&gt;first one on right, then left. Here the river bank is shallow, and there is <br/>
&gt;a rocky shore, with an old stone wall on its side. Beyond the bank becomes <br/>
&gt;a marsh--if you got this far, turn around. Beach the boat, look ahead in <br/>
&gt;the clearing and there's that chimney. Follow the by-land directions. This <br/>
&gt;spot in the river was in the Courant recently. It's a great picnic stop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
