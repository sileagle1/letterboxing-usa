<br/>
I thought this sounded kind of cool so I decided to check it out <br/>
(especially since it was kind of a rainy Sunday afternoon). Their <br/>
letterboxing chat room was really a lot of fun!<br/>
<br/>
It took me a little while to figure out how to get into it -- MSN <br/>
wanted me to choose a nickname but everything I tried was already <br/>
taken.  Well, I finally got in.  I didn't always understand what <br/>
they were talking about, but it was still a lot of fun!  They have <br/>
it every Sunday (evening for them, but afternoon for us).  Check it <br/>
out if it ever happens that you're not out boxing at this time of <br/>
day!<br/>
