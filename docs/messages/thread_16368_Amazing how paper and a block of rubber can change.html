Fly Doc, The Mollusk and I went for a hike last Friday in Jamesville,<br/>
NY and while there why not check on my "It's Good For a Dog, Walk"<br/>
letterbox to see who's visited.  The box wasn't there - gone!  This<br/>
was too much, after having a really bad week (a spinal tap on the 3rd.<br/>
with the usual 4 day brain throbber and just as it was leaving the<br/>
evil migraines shouted "hey mom what about us" and jumped in picking<br/>
up the slack - the nasty devils finally left this morning.  Plus our<br/>
internet connection / modem started popping in &amp; out and then finally<br/>
quit.  Aarggggh!)  In a voice that just couldn't take it any more, I<br/>
bleated to Fly Doc: "It's gone!"  Completely bummed we turned &amp;<br/>
started back, then wait!  Maybe an animal got it!  Quickly we hurried<br/>
back to check the area, and while Fly Doc stood guard I went in, but<br/>
before I got too far Fly Doc drew my attention to a young couple<br/>
looking suspicious not too far down the trail in the other direction.<br/>
 Hunkered down by a rock, looking like they might be doing something .<br/>
. . stamping in perhaps?  Excitedly we retraced our steps, our mood<br/>
(certainly mine) completely on the other end of the dial than 4<br/>
minutes earlier.  Trying to look nonchalant and interested in the<br/>
landscape, soon the young couple passed by.  As soon as they were out<br/>
of sight we hurried back and again Fly Doc stood guard.  This time the<br/>
box WAS in place and well hidden.  After withdrawing it I noticed it<br/>
had more inside than what was originally put.  Oh!  This time there<br/>
was no plaintive bleating cry but a thrilled announcement as I hurried<br/>
over with the goods.  Inside we found "The Honeymoon Hitchhiker<br/>
Letterbox" HH.  It's just amazing how a little baggie with some paper<br/>
and a block of rubber can change a day.    <br/>

all and that you got a HH to boot. :)  <br/>
We checked on our only planted box yesterday (we've also started 3 <br/>
HH's) and it was still there, very well hidden, and still not found <br/>
by anyone but ourselves. *sigh* It's been out there since early <br/>
August, but I don't think many people come to DE to letterbox. Maybe <br/>
one day someone will find it. As an added incentive, I'll let <br/>
everyone know that a HH awaits the next finder. I'm not tellin' which <br/>
one though. ;)<br/>

I for one can attest to the ability of a simple block of carved material and<br/>
a logbook can change the way that a day is going.  So much more than the<br/>
arrival of letters here in the mailing lists at times.  (Grin)<br/>

Thank you for sharing that story!<br/>
