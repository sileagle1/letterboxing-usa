Michigan on May 31, 2003, I am coordinating a project called <br/>
the "Visit Michigan" Letterbox Series.<br/>
<br/>
This will be a series of boxes, created by letterboxers across the <br/>
country, that will "Visit Michigan" for the gathering and then be <br/>
returned to the creator to be placed in the location of their <br/>
choice.  This will create an exciting, widely dispersed series of <br/>
letterboxes that have "Visited Michigan."<br/>
<br/>
I have e-mailed a few individuals, shamelessly soliciting <br/>
participation -- these are primarily folks whose boxes I have found, <br/>
whom I have exchanged e-mails with, or just am familiar with via this <br/>
talk list.  This is by no means an exclusive, "invitation-only" <br/>
thing -- if you were not included in the mailing and are interested <br/>
in participating, you are more than welcome to do so!<br/>
<br/>
Details and information can be found here:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.confessionsofdecember.com/extras/lb_visit_michigan.asp<br/>
<br/>
The only hard and fast rule is that the stamp must be hand-carved.  <br/>
Also note that participation is limited as there is a limit to the <br/>
number of boxes I can manage for the event and get mailed back <br/>
afterward.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me.  If you would like <br/>
to participate, please e-mail me offlist!  Thanks!<br/>
