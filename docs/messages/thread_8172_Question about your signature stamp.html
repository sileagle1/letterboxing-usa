&gt;I have a question for everyone about the stamp that you use to stamp the <br/>
&gt;log<br/>
&gt;book when you find the letterbox.  Have you had a custom stamp made with<br/>
&gt;your name on it?  I have a few of those, but most of them are "stamped by"<br/>
&gt;or "artwork by" type stamps.  Do you simply use a favorite symbol/image<br/>
&gt;without your name on it?  Stamps and ink are not a problem, as I am a <br/>

&gt;stamp artist and own thousands of stamps and many ink pads.  I just <br/>
&gt;wondered<br/>
&gt;what was appropriate -- or is the stamp simply chosen by personal<br/>
&gt;preference?<br/>

<br/>
As far as your question regarding signature stamps...  it really is <br/>
personal preference.  Most people use just an image of something that <br/>
is significant to them.  Some have their name or "nickname" also on <br/>
the stamp.  These are generally hand-carved or commissioned stamps.<br/>
<br/>
There really is no right or wrong as to what is on your signature <br/>
stamp, the color ink you use, how big it is, etc...  whatever moves <br/>
you.  Once you find a few boxes, you will be able to see what other <br/>
people are using for signature stamps as you browse through the <br/>
logbook.<br/>
<br/>
It is okay to change your signature stamp at any point if you think <br/>
of something more appropriate or decide to carve your own, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>You should find an image that is special for you, for whatever reason. Some folks have a store bought stamp, others have carved their own out of block cutting rubber or out of art erasers. It should be an image that you would like to be "known as" since most of us get to know these familiar stamps after a while.
<br/>
<br/>I found it very interesting at an lbna gathering to see how other letterboxers go about 'stamping in' ...some get very into using lots of different colors, others don't make much of a deal of it at all.
<br/>
<br/>Have fun with it.
