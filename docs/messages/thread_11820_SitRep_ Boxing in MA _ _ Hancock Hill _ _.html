some of the boxes that had eluded us thru the winter .<br/>
And we started with the three excellent stamps ( these are really <br/>
great  Russell !! ) in the " Noanet " Series in Dover MA . We also <br/>
picked up the <br/>
" Blue Hills Birthday " box on Sunday . Concerning the " Hancock <br/>
Hill " box , the clues note it as having gone missing some time in <br/>
Oct of 2001 , but<br/>
we found this box last November . I was going to check on it again on <br/>
Sunday but did not have the clues in hand and could not locate the <br/>
right tree .<br/>
I will definitely check on it this coming weekend . Has anybody else <br/>
been to this box recently ?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to All<br/>
