&gt; Are all these infected attachments driving everyone else nuts?!?  <br/>
My mailbox is filled with messages that I can't even delete.  I've <br/>
been trying to get on the site to stop having e-mails sent, but with <br/>
no success.  Is anyone else having trouble accessing letterboxing. <br/>
org?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Although I am guilty myself of sending my clues as attachments, I <br/>
am ready to vote NO to accepting attachments.<br/>

Dear Melissa, You can change the status of your mail by going to the <br/>
groups.yahoo.com site and then chose my groups and edit the way mail <br/>
is sent. I have always just read the letters on the web, rather than <br/>
have them delivered to my email. A safe way to avoid the <br/>
attatchments. I would vote no attatchments. Painterly<br/>
