Title: "Shell Game #2".Location: Paint Creek State Park, Ross County, <br/>
Ohio.Placed 3-2-03 by Salamander. Difficulty: Easy. This letterbox is <br/>
hidden near the picnic area and playground at the Paint Creek State <br/>
Park spillway. To get to the park, take US Rte. 50 (east from <br/>
Hillsboro or west fron Bainbridge) to Rapid Forge Road. Follow Rapid <br/>
Forge Rd. 2 miles to the park entrance on your left. The road to the <br/>
spillway parking area is about .5 miles from the entrance-- you will <br/>
be making a left turn off the entrance road.There is a large parking <br/>
area at the bottom of the hill. CLUES: Go up the slope to the top of <br/>
the long metal slide. Standing about 3 feet to the southwest of the <br/>
railroad tie "entrance platform" of the slide, take a reading of 165 <br/>
degrees and go 13 paces to a tall tree, which leans slightly to the <br/>
southwest and which has very few lower branches.Then go 9 paces from <br/>
the tree at a heading of 165 degrees. The letterbox is hidden in a <br/>
small "cave" formed by several moss covered boulders.<br/>
