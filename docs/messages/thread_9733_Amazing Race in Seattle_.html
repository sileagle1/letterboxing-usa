line and they had to run all around it including such famous <br/>
letterboxing places as Lincoln Park.  Was one of the roadblocks <br/>
finding the letterboxes there or something?!!!!  =)<br/>
<br/>
I've wanted to hide one at Gas Works Park, although I wasn't sure I <br/>
could find a place with it being so manicured and all.  But if a <br/>
backpack with a gun could hide out there for several months without <br/>
being discovered, I'm sure there's hope for a letterbox!  That was <br/>
way back in January of 2000 when a killer ditched his weapon in the <br/>
park.  And the only reason I know it much less remember it was <br/>
because I spent the night there the day before it was found while <br/>
watching the fireworks around the Space Needle to ring in the New <br/>
Year.  If I had heard of letterboxing then, *I* could have been the <br/>
one that found the weapon while beating bushing looking for a place <br/>
to hide one!<br/>
<br/>
Alas, I missed my fifteen minutes of fame.  Anyhow, I still thought <br/>
it was pretty cool to know they were running around the famous <br/>
Lincoln Park letterboxes, even if they didn't know it.  =)<br/>

Did anyone in Seattle know that the finish line was in their city?<br/>
