(which you find by sighting the boathouses, etc.) been determined to be in <br/>
place, or missing?<br/>
<br/>
We spent over an hour - and ran into Go Against the Flow, who were also <br/>
looking - and none of we five could find it.  My first defeat - bummer!    <br/>
Found Teddy's box - fabulous stamp!  The island was very busy - Sunday <br/>
afternoon, but we think it's still a secret :)<br/>

who we realized were letterboxers - tried to find that box.  We saw both <br/>
rockpiles, and figuring the compass readings could be fudged "to fit," tried <br/>
every path that met the clue descriptions, and scoured the ivy.  No luck.  <br/>
We did find Teddy, though - great stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone found it since?<br/>
