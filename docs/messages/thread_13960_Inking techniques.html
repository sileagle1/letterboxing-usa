I have been using a "Fresco" chalk finish dye inkpad. <br/>
I have had it for a few months and used it with no problems. <br/>
But the last few times I have used it the ink seems to be bubbling on my<br/>
stamp .<br/>
I am wondering if it could be <br/>
the humidity ?<br/>

I was wondering what inks the group would recommend?  It seems like the<br/>
"color box" pads I use bead up on my stamps.  I'm using the speedball pink<br/>

try a dye-based ink....the color box are a pigment ink....pigment ink <br/>
takes forever to dry and bleeds thru on thin paper.....<br/>
<br/>
i do not know how it would work with the pink carving material <br/>
tho...i have used the grey carving stuff when ive ATTEMPTED to carve <br/>
(it didnt work) and i used dye based ink with it and it seemed to <br/>
work fine...i use store bought stamps and i dont think ive ever had <br/>
the pigment ink bead up on me.(i could be wrong)......<br/>
<br/>
hope u find a suitable ink.....<br/>

I agree with another poster -- sounds like you're using pigment-based<br/>
ink. I've had this happen to me with pigment based but never with dye<br/>
based.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I'm using the speedball pink stuff as a medium.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've had the beading and clumping happen with pigment-based ink on the<br/>
pink stuff, on erasers, and on PZ Cut. It's the pigment in the ink,<br/>
not the carving material, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
But I wouldn't stop using pigment-based pads. Maybe you'd want to use<br/>
them when you do the initial stamp in the logbook of a box you're<br/>
placing, but maybe you'd rather box with a dye-based pad. That's the<br/>
method I often use. The stamp images from the pigment-based inks are,<br/>
IMO, lovelier looking.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Another thing you may want to try if your stamp has large black <br/>
spaces, which is where ink tends to bead up and adhere less the <br/>
perfect, is to very gently go over the black areas with a fine <br/>
sandpaper after you have finished carving.  This will get rid of the <br/>
shiney surface and the ink will take better.  Just be really careful <br/>
when using sandpaper on an already carved stamp, especially if there <br/>
is fine detail.<br/>
