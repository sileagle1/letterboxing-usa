                    <html><body><b>OHIO FOSSIL LETTERBOX</b>
<br/>West Lafayette, IN  Tippecanoe County
<br/>Happy Hollow Park
<br/>Difficulty: easy walk on path, road and grass field.
<br/>Placed: March 9, 2002 by Team Boji (ZAX31@AOL)
<br/>
<br/>Driving Directions:  Happy Hollow Park is off Happy Hollow Road between State Route 52 and County Route 43 near the Wabash River.
<br/>
<br/>Clues:  Park in the first parking area next to Shelter House #1.  Look for the Trolley Line Trail and proceed up the steps.  Walk along the trail until it comes to an asphalt road.  A heading of approx. 270 degrees will take you across the road and a bridge.  On the other side of the bridge take a heading of approx. 280 degrees to a small picnic shelter with a grill in front.  From the grill walk a heading of approx. 345 degrees for 17 paces along the woods edge.  One pace equals two steps or approx. five feet.  Turning to your left, you may see a fallen tree lying in a general east - west directions. At the stump of this tree you may see a flat rock containing fossils.  Under that rock may be the <b>OHIO FOSSIL LETTERBOX</b>.  Both box and rock came from Cincinnati.
