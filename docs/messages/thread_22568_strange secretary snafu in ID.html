Okay, so I had a new experience this week.  I came to work on <br/>
Tuesday and the secretary at my office told me that it was too bad I <br/>
wasn't with them that weekend.  She then proceeded to tell me that <br/>
they went camping in Swan Valley, ID and saw a piece of tupperware <br/>
on the picnic table in their campground site.  When she got in, she <br/>
was surprised to see it was a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, they had no way of knowing where it was supposed to be <br/>
hidden, so she said she just left it sitting there on the picnic <br/>
table!  She thought it was really funny that they found one and she <br/>
took down the name of the box to tell me about it in case I hadn't <br/>
found that one yet.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, I have found that one before (A Camping We Will Go) and <br/>
unfortunately, I don't have time to go rescue the box right now.  It <br/>
is making me sad to know there is a box that could be saved, but <br/>
will probably be lost.  The planter can't get out there either.  I <br/>
can't believe that the thought didn't occur to them that someone <br/>
would do something to the box, and maybe they should bring it back <br/>
to me instead of leaving it on the table.  It sounds as if <br/>
everything is intact in the box.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen stamps in a few logbooks from a couple of letterboxers <br/>
around this area that haven't made themselves publicly known or <br/>
planted any boxes.  If any of them are reading the list and can make <br/>
it to Swan Valley, feel free to rescue a LB for us.  Other than <br/>
that, the planter and I are the only active letterboxers on this <br/>
side of the state that I know of.<br/>
