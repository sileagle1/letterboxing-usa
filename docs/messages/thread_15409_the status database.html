I (or more accuratelly the moderators) have been asked to make an "immediate" <br/>
decision on the matter of the status database.  The choices presented are <br/>
"kill it" or "lock it down".  I'm not reading the list presently; hopefully <br/>
these terms mean something to those who have an interest in this issue (and<br/>
hopefully this post will not look too awkwardly out of context :-))<br/>
<br/>
First, let me say that I had nothing to do with the creation of this thing,<br/>
and thus am hesitent to walk into the resulting morass.  Why me?  Not really<br/>
fair to me and the moderators to be asked to make a decision that will piss<br/>
half the people off (those who's position is decided against).  We're <br/>
innocent on this one; the moderators' jobs are to deal with list trolls, spam, <br/>
and off-topic/offensive content, not make gamemaster decisions -- i.e., <br/>
desisions that impose the way the game is played on the list.<br/>
<br/>
I've thought about this a great deal.  Some observations come to mind --<br/>
<br/>
* I've been told "[t]he vast majority is silent".  If so, I question why it is <br/>
so hot?  If only a few care, why all the hubbub.  Lets revisit it in<br/>
a year or two, when more people care.  I mean, letterboxing is gone since 1859<br/>
without this, since 1989 or earlier in North America without this, and since<br/>
1998 on this list.  Need we decide this week?  Jay has made an excellent <br/>
argument for deferring this decision a while.  I'd like to do that -- I _will_<br/>
decide further on, but feel free to maintain the status quo if you feel <br/>
deferral would be a better idea.<br/>
<br/>
* If I decide to kill it -- this is a form of censorship, and a form of <br/>
gamemastering, dictating the way the game is played.  Those who "really like"<br/>
it will hate _me_, an innocent in the debate.  I don't want to be hated.<br/>
<br/>
* If I decide to lock it down -- I am sanctioning it, and those who "hate"<br/>
it will hate _me_, an innocent in the debate.  I don't want to be hated.  <br/>
Moreover, locking it down would further erode the rights of those who do <br/>
not wish their boxes in the database -- now they can remove them, under <br/>
the lock it down idea, they must pester a single db volunteer or one of <br/>
the volunteer moderators (more work) to get their thing out of there.  <br/>
(I'll admit that I'm not too keen on the present setup where those who <br/>
don't want their boxes there have to do the work of monitoring a db they <br/>
are uninterested in, then do the work of removal).<br/>
<br/>
Now, its not the moderator's job to protect the rights of other letterboxers<br/>
in the game of letterboxing, as much as they may empathize with the feeling of<br/>
trespass on these rights.  (We would hope that simple common courtesy would<br/>
mitigate trespass, but I'm told boxes are being added against the wishes of<br/>
their creators).  Moreover, we lock down posts that could contain<br/>
the same content on the e-mail portion of the list, isn't the db simply <br/>
another medium?  Shouldn't the same protections be extended to it?  Yes, <br/>
they should, despite the fact that one is fermentation, and one is <br/>
distillation.  In other words, not locking down is akin to letting Joe Schmoe<br/>
delete any _message_ on the list.  But this is a very legalistic reading<br/>
of things, one is stronger that the other (this is not a black and white<br/>
world).  <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, it is the moderator's job to uphold the list charter <br/>
(http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html).  One of the violations is <br/>
"spoilers" -- spoilers are defined differently than percisely what the <br/>
database contains, but that does not mean the database content does <br/>
not contain spoilers.  Of course it does.  We're volunteers, not lawyers, <br/>
and can't help if the charter defintion of spoilers doesn't cover all <br/>
sorts of spoilers.  The simple fact of person X indicating they found <br/>
box Y is a spoiler.  Thus nuking this thing is perfectly justifiable <br/>
under the no spoilers clause, tho a more appropriate response would be <br/>
to nuke only those boxes in the db where spoilers matter (this is not a <br/>
black and white world).  Who judges what is a spoiler?  Moderators?  Do<br/>
we want this?<br/>
<br/>
So, the right thing for me to do is to not decide this.  Hated either way.<br/>
I really don't want to, and don't feel I should be put in a position to.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, if I don't decide, I'll prolly be hated by everyone (or the vast <br/>
minority who care) for being wishy washy.  So, knowing I will be hated by <br/>
someone no matter what I do or don't do,  I will decide what I feel is <br/>
right and represents an opt-in compromise --<br/>
<br/>
The status database can be locked down, provided permission from the box<br/>
creator is obtained before listing that individual's boxes in the db, or<br/>
provided the box is listed as abandoned, unowned, has a foster parent, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
If this is unworkable, that is not my problem.  Anything is workable with<br/>
enough time and money.  I'm not going to sanction something that further <br/>
erodes the rights of those who do not wish to participate in this thing.  <br/>
Nor am I going to nuke the freedom of those who do want to use this list <br/>
tool, provided others' rights are respected.  Sometimes protecting others' <br/>
rights is alot of work if you want to make progress.  Just try building <br/>
a smokestack factory near a subdivision.  Under this decision, those who <br/>
like it can use it, those who don't can ignore it, and who better to decide<br/>
whether they think the fields in this database will spoil their boxes than<br/>
the creator?  Also, under this decision, those who are offended by this<br/>
idea and are resorting to wanton removal of records have no reason to be <br/>
any longer, they can rest assured that all boxes are there by permission<br/>
and people are playing the game as they wish to play it. <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your understanding in the position I've been put in to <br/>
decide an apparently contentious issue under an immediate time frame.  <br/>
If you must hate me, an innocent in this debate, please do so in silence.<br/>
Life is too short to spend more time on this.<br/>
