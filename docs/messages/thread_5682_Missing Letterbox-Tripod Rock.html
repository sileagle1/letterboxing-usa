Most likely the Tripod Rock letterbox is gone for good this time.  I <br/>
always thought I planted it too close to the trail, but after it was <br/>
moved and left out in the open for over a month with folks signing in <br/>
to it after 9/11, I thought it would be safe.  If someone finding it <br/>
by accident read all the notes, I really didn't think it would go <br/>
missing.  However I will check on it soon, but for now I would <br/>
consider it missing.  <br/>
<br/>
Glad you enjoyed the other two boxes, there are two more on Turkey <br/>
Mountain if you are so inclined.    <br/>
