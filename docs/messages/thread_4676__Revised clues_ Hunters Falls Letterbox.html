Easy clues and terrain<br/>
<br/>
The fashion statement for today is orange. From Route 495, take Exit <br/>
21B.  Continue straight through the light and have the luck of the <br/>
Irish as the road rises to meet you.  Desert glimpses on the left are <br/>
followed by vistas of inland seas on both sides.  Continue your <br/>
journey heavenward, and just after mile one, a celestial being will <br/>
mark the place to take a left.  Follow this road past the harvest of <br/>
gold and Bo Peep's charges and later, a pint-sized Ponderosa.  Look <br/>
for the Sentry Post on your right - it is your signal to slow down.  <br/>
Watch for the Tribe's Crimson Fortress on your left and park near the <br/>
picnic bench.<br/>
<br/>
Sit down for a spell at the picnic bench as you listen to the Hunters <br/>
Falls on your right and gaze forward at another inland sea.  Glance <br/>
over your right shoulder to spot the entrance to the pink ribbon <br/>
marked trail.  Enter the trail, careful to follow the pink ribbon <br/>
trail.  Cross over the bridge and take in the full beauty of the <br/>
Hunters Falls on your left.  Continue along the pink flagged trail to <br/>
where the trail forks at a large boulder next to a freshly cut tree.  <br/>
If you look inland toward the right trail, you will see Target One.  <br/>
Instead, follow the left trail along the water.   Fifteen paces from <br/>
the freshly cut tree along the water trail, you will find yourself in <br/>
front of a pine sapling.  Reach below the ledge rock beneath the <br/>
sapling to bag your catch.<br/>
<br/>
Be *sure* to take my fashion advice and wear bright orange.  Enjoy!<br/>
