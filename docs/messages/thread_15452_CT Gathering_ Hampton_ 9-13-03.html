Both will be retired soon after this event. There will also be about 10<br/>

&gt;Alright a gathering in Hampton on Sept,13 "hey" you know we will be there,summer will be over before you know it,and theres alot of people that we have not met yet.So for a good time,lets all get together in Hampton and give Ginger a great send off.Were putting extra ink in our ink pad for all the exchanges that we hope to get.I,m pretty sure that there will be more than 10 boxes to find,but you will never know unless you come.And don't forget about the "FREE"FOOD and DRINK that will be there,and all those Hitch Hikers to collect,see you then,cuz now were off to go letterboxing.Lenny/Kathy The NeeDeeps  <br/>
