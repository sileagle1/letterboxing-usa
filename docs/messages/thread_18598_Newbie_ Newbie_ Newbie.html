<br/>
My wife and I just got into LB on the advice of one of her friends on LiveJournal.  I have to say, I really like it.  It's a chance to get the three of us (19mo old baby girl in a backpack) out and about.  We have already found a few and even dragged my parent out to a medium difficulty (oops.  Gotta read that part before taking aging parents).<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I look forward to talking with lots of you in the coming years.  We pare planning a trip to my out-laws (sorry dear, in-laws) this weekend and we have already scoped out all the LB.  We will even drag them out on a few (but I will make sure they are easy difficulty).<br/>
<br/>
Looking for other LB in the Philadelphia/Baltimore area to chat.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
