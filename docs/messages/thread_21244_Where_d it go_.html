The post from Flamethrower seemed to disappear but her Ladyship must<br/>
still unburden herself. <br/>
<br/>
Flamethrower, responding to the coment about the burgers and a local<br/>
establishment went something like;<br/>
"Don't live near an In And Out yadda yadda I never found the divine in<br/>
ground meat but you did once find her Ladyship in a taco"<br/>
<br/>
Dearest Thrower of Flames,<br/>
<br/>
That image of her Ladyship in the taco was not an instance of a<br/>
miraculous revelation, although not unlikely; her Ladyship has often<br/>
offered words of inspiration to religious leaders around the world.<br/>
No, that was an ersatz tribute to her Ladyship.<br/>
<br/>
We had been on holiday in Mexico purchasing some hand crafted tiles to<br/>
remodel the pool house at the Manor in an hacienda style for a Mexican<br/>
themed party and checking on the children, I mean workers, at the<br/>
linen factory where her Ladyship has all her monogrammed table linens<br/>
and lace hankies custom made for all her many dinner parties and do's.<br/>
Well, while passing through the dusty little factory town it seems her<br/>
Ladyship caught the eye of one of the taco fryers at the taco factory<br/>
next door to the linen factory. It seems this poor fellow's vision was<br/>
a bit hazy from repeated conjunctival scaring from hot oil splattering<br/>
in his eyes. Well, he mistook the glint of the hot Mexican sun on the<br/>
Prisspott diadem for a halo and fell to his knees asking the Virgin to<br/>
bless him. It was a bit confusing at first but her Ladyship quickly<br/>
realized his mistake. It took some doing but her Ladyship finally<br/>
convinced the poor boy that her Ladyship, although oft described as<br/>
divine, was merely mortal. One thing lead to another and well, let us<br/>
just say that Miguel was left with no doubt that her Ladyship was not<br/>
the virgin he first thought.<br/>
<br/>
Miguel continues to worship her Ladyship nonetheless, it seems her<br/>
Ladyship left a broken heart in Mexico. Miguel worked through his<br/>
sorrow by chiseling her Ladyship's visage in his taco press and well,<br/>
suddenly her Ladyship likeness was staring out from Taco Bell tacos<br/>
all over North America fried in tribute on corn tortillas by a<br/>
heartbroken factory worker south of the border.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately Miguel's blurred vision meant the likeness was not quite<br/>
picture perfect and few recognized it as her Ladyship. Those who<br/>
questioned her Ladyship about it were easily convinced that they were<br/>
selected to recieve a message from the BVM. Admissions went up a bit<br/>
at the local home for the bewildered but the director does send a<br/>
lovely gift basket every year.<br/>
<br/>
There now, her Ladyship feels much better to finally have out with it.<br/>
