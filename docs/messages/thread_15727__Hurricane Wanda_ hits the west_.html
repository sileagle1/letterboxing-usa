Yes, Psychomommy, Wanda does seem to get around.  She <br/>
even got caught up in a blizzard out in Colorado, where she is <br/>
right now, just having coming down from "14er" Mt. Sneffels in <br/>
two feet of new snow.  She actually could have made the <br/>
Colorado gathering, had it been a week or two later, but instead <br/>
she did get to add half a dozen new states to her letterboxing <br/>
count on the drive out, and dropped off a few more of RTRW's <br/>
boxes in the midwest, too.   Now she's getting ready to do some <br/>
trail work projects along the Continental Divide.  One of her long <br/>
term goals has been to try to help build a few more miles of trail <br/>
out there each year or whenever she can, to make up for the <br/>
1000 miles of "trailess" sections that existed when she hiked the <br/>
CDT years ago.  Many people don't seem to realize that Wanda's <br/>
5 times through on the AT constitute less than half of her total <br/>
backpacking mileage, with 3 times through on the Pacific Crest <br/>
(Mexico to Canada), the CDT, and goodness knows how many <br/>
other trails comprising by far the larger bulk of her trail <br/>
experience.  Anyway, she'll be out of the letterboxing circuit for a <br/>
while, as she goes about her trail work and maybe gets to climb <br/>
a few more "14ers" in between.  She sends her greetings to the <br/>
folks at Chuck's gathering and hopes to see some of them later <br/>
this fall.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Pete<br/>
