                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dear Investigator Bacon, <br/>
<br/>
     Surely you must be jesting! I have never been so<br/>
insulted in my entire life. A broad? I am a lady, sir!<br/>
Might I also add that I am the one responsible for<br/>
your bread and butter, and I do hope you have that<br/>
butter knife correctly placed in your setting!<br/>
<br/>
     Odd as you are, I would still expect you to grasp<br/>
the concept of manners. A woman is a lady, not a<br/>
broad. I implore you to keep this in mind,<br/>
Investigator Bacon. Just as a woman is a lady, a man<br/>
is a gentleman. Mr. Mark Pepe certainly seems to have<br/>
seen the error of his ways and is striving to become<br/>
an exemplary gentleman. <br/>
<br/>
     Lack of proper etiquette, is indeed, a misfortune<br/>
upon society. Have you forgotten for what you were<br/>
employed? Just how do you propose to solve this crime<br/>
when you, yourself, are a contributor to the<br/>
atrocities of improper etiquette?<br/>
<br/>
    Vandalization of the English language will not be<br/>
tolerated. Broad indeed! A lady must always be<br/>
referred to as a lady. <br/>
<br/>
    Enlivening the vocabulary is not an impossible<br/>
task, even for one of your nature. Perhaps a class on<br/>
how to cultivate an agreeable speech would be in<br/>
order?<br/>
<br/>
Truly, <br/>
<br/>
Ms. Emily Post<br/>
<br/>
