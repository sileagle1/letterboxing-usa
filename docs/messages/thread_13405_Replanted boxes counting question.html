Glad to see this box is back. The trails there are<br/>
quite nice. An interesting question came to mind,<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
What is the counting etiquette on hunting a box that<br/>
has moved from one hiding spot to another, but the<br/>
stamp is unchanged? Can someone that previously found<br/>
this box refind it and count again, almost like if you<br/>
find the same HH twice in two different boxes, or<br/>
would you not count it again in your F count?<br/>

This is in the faq<br/>
<br/>
&gt; A box can be counted as Found more than once if the preceeding apply, <br/>
&gt; and its clue, location, and stamp<br/>
&gt; image have all changed since Found the first time. <br/>
<br/>
So ...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; What is the counting etiquette on hunting a box that<br/>
&gt; has moved from one hiding spot to another, but the<br/>
&gt; stamp is unchanged? Can someone that previously found<br/>
&gt; this box refind it and count again, <br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; almost like if you find the same HH twice in two different boxes, or<br/>
&gt; would you not count it again in your F count?<br/>
<br/>
No, unless the HH stamp has changed.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you can always count however you please ... but the principle<br/>
is ... you've solved a problem, you've found a new place, and have<br/>
collected a new image (at least that's my principle, which I based the<br/>
faq on).  In most cases, tho, opinion seems to have run along these<br/>
lines, more or less.<br/>
<br/>
(Of course, there are interesting wrinkles this simple rule can't cover,<br/>
yours to discover :-))<br/>
