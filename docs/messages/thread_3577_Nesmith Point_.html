<br/>
John went up on Friday and nabbed your water buffalo on Nesmith Point.<br/>
Another beautiful stamp!  That whole safari series is wonderful!  I've<br/>
only got the hippo but he has them all!!!  Also, now he's contemplating<br/>
hiding Hannah somewhere in an existing letterbox, possibly.  He wanted<br/>
to do a Lava Canyon letterbox, but has procrastinated and thinks he<br/>
ought to get <br/>
Hannah out there for others to enjoy.  Do you want to know when and<br/>
where he hides it?   <br/>
<br/>
Also, what about LoneMassWolf's visit?  I haven't heard anything from<br/>
anyone.  Maybe someone can arrange something for Saturday night and that<br/>
will be more popular.  Unfortuately, I'm booked solid Saturday night. <br/>
<br/>
Hey...Did you get a job at Intel again?  It's almost November.  I hope<br/>
you got to have tons of fun but are now or soon to be gainfully employed<br/>
making the big bucks again.  <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing from you!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
