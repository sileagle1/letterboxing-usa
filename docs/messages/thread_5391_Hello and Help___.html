<br/>
I read an article about letterboxing this past weekend in the <br/>
Hartford Courant (CT).  I was immediately excited about letterboxing <br/>
and went onto the Letterboxing.org website to find out more.  I was <br/>
hooked.  I went out &amp; bought everything I needed, carved a stamp<br/>
(which is amazing in itself, not having even a touch of artistic <br/>
talent), and decided to take my dog and letterbox on the next nice <br/>
day.  Well that was on Sunday, today is the first nice day since and <br/>
I decided to go for the Favorite things in nearby Somers CT.  The <br/>
problem is I cannot get onto the website,  I've been trying all <br/>
morning.  If anyone has the clues for the Favorite things boxes in <br/>
Somers CT  would you please E-mail them to me.  I would be very <br/>
grateful for any information.  My e-mail address is tevppets@aol.com.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
