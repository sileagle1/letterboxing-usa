Shake your head in disgust, make a few comments to yourself, and ignore <br/>
them.<br/>
Self-moderating seems to be the best idea yet. I see no reason for this <br/>
list<br/>
to be "moderated" or censored.<br/>
<br/>
If you ignore most of the intentional<br/>
inflammatory "rhetoric" and take a dose of   netiquette, all will be <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Lighten up, don't take every word thats written as face value, the <br/>
wording<br/>
of some statements were probably not meant the way you read them.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to be easily offended, and also try not to easily offend others.<br/>

We all need to learn some respect<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Moderate (was)Re: over rated!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I think it is time to request that the moderators of this group<br/>
consider moderating the posts of gingerbreadjunk. It is obvious that<br/>
this person is goading others with incendiary language and personal<br/>
attacks. It is also obvious that the opinions of others, whether shared<br/>
by other newcomers or those who are long-time letterboxers, are not<br/>
being heard and valued by this person. He is not interested in<br/>
collaberating or respecting the well-intentioned thoughts of those who<br/>
have a great deal more experience. Rather, he is more invested in<br/>
arguing and listening to his own inflammatory rhetoric and being<br/>
offensive. As a long time member of this list, I am asking for some<br/>
kind of intervention from the Moderators in order to restore peace<br/>
here. Thank you.<br/>

&gt; Gee, why is it that some things/people are inappropriate but others<br/>
&gt; don't seem to be?<br/>

&gt; Why is gingerbreadjunk allowed to tell people to shut up, berate the<br/>
&gt; owner of the HH in question and demean another member here,<br/>
&gt; demanding they be "put in their place", but few people call him on<br/>
&gt; it, but here we are jumping all over someone who gives him right<br/>
&gt; back a portion of what he's handing out?<br/>
