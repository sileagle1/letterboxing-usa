                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ahh...It was I who planted these boxes about a month ago...the clues are <br/>
like many other sets that I've encountered...deliberately ambiguous to <br/>
allow for more exploration of this area, and to make the search a little <br/>
harder!  Did you try the hunt from both of the stone walls that you <br/>
saw?   We didn't intend for the clues to be frustrating, just a little <br/>
harder. (i.e. not spelling out every step of the hunt)<br/>
Anyone else find these boxes?<br/>
