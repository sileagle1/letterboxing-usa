Yes, and although it is tempting, I do not hide things out at the <br/>

As much as I would like to say bravo for trying to bring a bit of sport to our brave men and women in Iraq (or, as one T-Shirt I saw at the fair, "Who's your Baghdaddy?"), I would have to agree with Sir B. on this one...  <br/>
<br/>
We all know that our sport is harmless enough (as long as we continue to "leave things better than they were")... But in this, our time of trial in this continuing unstable country of Iraq, serious thought must be given to how someone that is unfamiliar with our hobby/sport would react to seeing a container, seemingly well hidden, on a military installation?  Put yourself in their shoes... what would you do??  Is it worth possibly sending an entire base into a "lock-down" because of a piece of 'tupperware' and a stamp?  And, what would be the repercussions of said action if you were the one that planted it?  Not being a military veteran myself, but being the other half of an ex-Navy man, I can only say that I would pity the person that stood before a possible court-martial because of a harmless hobby.....<br/>
<br/>
Let us not forget the many "devices" such as toys that various groups have used to hide bombs and other type of things... The bottom line is this:  If someone innocently hides a letterbox in or around an area where terrorists attacks are taking place on almost a daily basis, I can guarantee you that someone who has no idea what a letterbox is will see it, report it, and cause somebody to at least lose a stripe over it...  Case in point... Athens, GA City Hall recently... "Random act of kindness" middle school kid hiding a bag of candy in the barrel of a ceremonial cannon caused City Hall and a 1-square block radius to be shut down while the bomb squad detonated a bag of Jolly Rogers....<br/>
<br/>
And the last thought to ponder on this?<br/>
<br/>
The simple fact that this innocent sport could be turned against the very people who enjoy it.... Ponder that....<br/>

Everyone knows that in many normal situations, not even to mention the current situation over here in Iraq, people get spooked when they see things out of the ordinary. At least I know that I would.<br/>
<br/>
That is why I would NEVER place a box in this environment without the knowledge and full support of the person(s) responsible for maintaing and providing security for that such area.<br/>

I understand that completely, and in my not so humble opinion, I don't feel<br/>
that this type of entertainment is appropriate for that area.  That is why<br/>
Kris and I wrote that letter last night.  Pleas understand we are NOT in any<br/>
way condemning anyone for wanting to do that, and, having been in the<br/>
military for quite a few years, I myself am well aware of how overwhelmingly<br/>
boring it can become at times when away from home, family and friends.<br/>
<br/>
I would no sooner plant a box here on McChord AFB property, even if I have<br/>
the permission and knowledge of the Base Commander, unless it was a one time<br/>
event, that would be removed at the end of the event, than I would in the<br/>
middle of a war zone..  Even if you get the permission from the building<br/>
maintainer/supervisor, there will always be a chance that he'll not be<br/>
around the one time that someone, who knows knowing about letterboxing,<br/>
stumbles across it and there ya go, the bomb squads on the way.<br/>
<br/>
Please understand, we are not condemning this idea in anyway. If you want to<br/>
plant unknown boxes in a war zone, you of course, have that prerogative, and<br/>
far be it from me to tell a fellow military person that they can not have<br/>
some entertainment. I just don't think this to be appropriate with the<br/>
situation there.<br/>

1. Does is sound like a decent, if not a great, idea...?<br/>

2. Does is sound like an idea that is asking for trouble and wasting precious resources and man/woman hours?<br/>

1)  I suppose since WE are not in Iraq we must rely on YOUR good judgement <br/>
when it comes to letterboxing.  The fact that YOU are there would make me <br/>
think you would most likely not put yourself or others in danger and would <br/>
have given this a good deal of thought before hand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2)  I have spoken with a couple of people I know and we are hoping to send <br/>
not only stamp carving supplies but a couple calligraphy sets as well. I <br/>
would be willing to purchase some supplies wholesale to ship to you(if <br/>
anyone would like to contribute please let me know). MY THINKING was if <br/>
carving and sketching helped to make some soldiers time away from home a bit <br/>
more endurable it was time and money well spent on my end.<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not a letterbox ever gets placed I think helping in anyway we can <br/>
is the least us lucky ones at home can do for those of you away from your <br/>
homes right now.<br/>
<br/>
MAYBE we can include sase postcards with each carving kit and the <br/>
letterboxer who  contributes $5.50 the wholesale cost of a carver and piece <br/>
of pink stuff in a kit) The solidier who carved the stamp could send the <br/>
image back home to the letterboxer......hmmm I could be on to something <br/>
here? Iraq exchanges...how would we have to count those?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for listening to me ramble.....I think this is the least we <br/>
can do for OUR Troops stationed in Iraq and trust Kris knows what he's <br/>
doing!!<br/>

Please don't misunderstand me Beth.  Your intentions are of the best nature<br/>
and I applaud you, however, the original conversation is not about sending a<br/>
care package to troops in Iraq or anywhere else for that matter, it is about<br/>
the planting of items that could be mistaken for, at the very least, F.O.D.<br/>

<br/>
Again, in my not so humble opinion, I feel it wrong to attempt to plant<br/>
something of this nature on a military base, let alone on a base in a war<br/>
zone.  I do feel that it should be our duty to do whatever we can to support<br/>
our troops overseas and here at home, lord knows how much I appreciated<br/>
those care packages when I was in.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't think me a spoilsport at all, just one who has seen the best of<br/>
intentions go awry and in this case, that could end up with someone<br/>
court-martialed or worse.<br/>
<br/>
If were talking about setting up a stamp exchange with the troops, then by<br/>
all means, sign Rayvenhaus up!<br/>

P.S.  I am sure that Kris is a very intelligent, competent person who has<br/>
thought this out as completely as he can. I'm not worried about him, I'm<br/>
thinking of the other people that are there that don't have a clue what a<br/>
letterbox is, or why that package is buried under those rocks.<br/>

&gt; 1)  I suppose since WE are not in Iraq we must rely on YOUR good judgement<br/>
&gt; when it comes to letterboxing.  The fact that YOU are there would make me<br/>
&gt; think you would most likely not put yourself or others in danger and would<br/>
&gt; have given this a good deal of thought before hand.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2)  I have spoken with a couple of people I know and we are hoping to send<br/>
&gt; not only stamp carving supplies but a couple calligraphy sets as well. I<br/>
&gt; would be willing to purchase some supplies wholesale to ship to you(if<br/>
&gt; anyone would like to contribute please let me know). MY THINKING was if<br/>
&gt; carving and sketching helped to make some soldiers time away from home a<br/>
bit<br/>
&gt; more endurable it was time and money well spent on my end.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Whether or not a letterbox ever gets placed I think helping in anyway we<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; is the least us lucky ones at home can do for those of you away from your<br/>
&gt; homes right now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; MAYBE we can include sase postcards with each carving kit and the<br/>
&gt; letterboxer who  contributes $5.50 the wholesale cost of a carver and<br/>
piece<br/>
&gt; of pink stuff in a kit) The solidier who carved the stamp could send the<br/>
&gt; image back home to the letterboxer......hmmm I could be on to something<br/>
&gt; here? Iraq exchanges...how would we have to count those?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, thanks for listening to me ramble.....I think this is the least we<br/>
&gt; can do for OUR Troops stationed in Iraq and trust Kris knows what he's<br/>
&gt; doing!!<br/>

&gt; &gt;Point well taken. Each person is entitled to his/her own opinion on the<br/>
&gt; &gt;matter. Some may say that it is a good idea, whereas others may tend to<br/>
&gt; &gt;think it not such a good idea.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So....LetterBoxers of the list.....What do you all think?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;1. Does is sound like a decent, if not a great, idea...?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2. Does is sound like an idea that is asking for trouble and wasting<br/>
&gt; &gt;precious resources and man/woman hours?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I would like to hear the masses ideas on this one....<br/>

  As a Navy wife, who has had her car searched at the gate due to random<br/>
searches, and questioned about it's contents.<br/>
<br/>
  "Ummm, Maam, what is that? Or what did it used to be?" "Welllll, I have no<br/>
clue, but I wouldn't let your bomb sniffing dog eat it..."<br/>
<br/>
  I think this would have a great deal of downsides. It's harmless, and we<br/>
all know it, but not everyone is going to, and if it is construed as<br/>
suspicious, there will more than likely be ramifications from it. I hate to<br/>
see anyone get in trouble from it. Another downside to this is if an<br/>
aggressor heard about it and later placed a Tupperware containing a bomb<br/>
rather than a stamp and everyone was complacent about it, and people got<br/>
hurt or worse.<br/>
<br/>
  A suggestion would be if you want to try to gain support for letterboxing,<br/>
hold an event. One day where everyone can carve, place and find boxes, then<br/>
have them all picked up. My 2 cents,<br/>

Thanks again for all of your support. I like your Iraq stamp exchange idea...that sounds really good.<br/>
<br/>
There is anoher yahoo groups list called IALC where they do somethink called "Random Acts of Kindness", or RAK. Somewhat the same thing, a person creates a piece of artwork (postcards usually) and mails them out randomly whenever they feel the urge to members on the RAK list.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we can do the same type of thing here...instead we would follow your suggestion. As the "Carvers" over here would send postcards with the images to you all back in the states...becasue anything under 16 ounces is free for us to send via the US Postal service...<br/>
