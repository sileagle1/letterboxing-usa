<div>Another newbie from MA checking in.  We found our first two 
letterboxes, Gray Reservation and Bolton Quarry, over the 
weekend.  We all have our own personal stamps now (even the dog) and we got 
a kit and have started carving a special stamp for a letterbox we plan to plant 
in the near future.  We need to work with clues a little more before we 
write our own.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We looked for Two Hearts when we were at the sculpture garden a couple of 
weeks ago but it was very crowded and some really obnoxious people got 
in the way and we could not be discrete so we gave up.  My friend wants to 
try East Point Lighthouse, that one sounds like a challenge.</div>
