I've made some great friends through letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
In case anyone is interested, I posted a photo from our gathering <br/>
in Boise, ID on the Rocky Mountain letterboxing site, which I <br/>
believe allows public access to archives.  This was such a fun <br/>
day for us.  A few came from WA, but other than them, this picture <br/>
shows you every single letterboxer in the state of Idaho!!  We've <br/>
more than doubled our numbers in the last six months, but when <br/>
you consider that there were only two of us before, it isn't quite <br/>
such a feat!<br/>
<br/>
I will also do one of the  Salt Lake gathering as soon as I get my <br/>
film back.  We held both inside due to very cold temps and snow, <br/>
but somehow A-Bear and I ended up tromping out in the snow <br/>
looking for boxes after both gatherings.  I guess we're gluttons <br/>
for punishment!<br/>
<br/>
anyway, here's the reference for the Rocky Mountain group:<br/>

<br/>
have a great day boxing!<br/>
