Alder Box<br/>
<br/>
Placed on October 6, 2002 by hoofandspoke<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION: Taylor Mountain County Park<br/>
Nearest City: Hobart<br/>
County: King<br/>
State: Washington<br/>
Country: USA<br/>
<br/>
NOTES<br/>
I hope to have all of my boxes be accessible to<br/>
equestrians, hikers and mtn. bikers.<br/>
<br/>
TREK AND WEATHER FACTORS<br/>
Moderate. Could be wet in the winter in quite a few<br/>
spots. Wheelchair access not available for this<br/>
series, sorry.<br/>
<br/>
RESTRICTIONS<br/>
It's a county park, so dogs should remain on leash at<br/>
all times. Obey all trail closures. Report wildlife<br/>
(bear and/or cougar) sightings to the County.<br/>
<br/>
TIME TO COMPLETE<br/>
A few hours? I can't really judge by foot for humans.<br/>
Please let me know and I will update this section.<br/>
<br/>
CLUE DIFFICULTY<br/>
Fairly easy is my guess.<br/>
<br/>
STAMP QUALITY<br/>
Fair. Not carved on site, but done pretty hastily.<br/>
<br/>
GETTING THERE<br/>
Coming from I-90 in Issaquah, take the Front St. Exit<br/>
and head south. Go almost 9 miles. When you reach the<br/>
stoplight at SR-18 which is the on ramp to head over<br/>
Tiger Mountain to North bend, go through the light and<br/>
park in the parking area just to the left.<br/>
<br/>
Coming from the south/west (Tacoma/Federal Way/Auburn)<br/>
Take SR-18 to Hobart Exit, at the stoplight, take a<br/>
right and park in the area just to your left.<br/>
<br/>
Coming from the east (North Bend; from over Tiger<br/>
Mountain) Take SR-18 to Hobart Exit, take a left at<br/>
the stop sign onto Issaquah-Hobart Rd. Just past the<br/>
stoplight, park in the parking area on your left.<br/>
<br/>
The parking area is NOT designated with any signs.<br/>
Occasionally you will see horse trailers or other<br/>
vehicles parked here. it's a popular spot for mountain<br/>
bikers to park at as well.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES<br/>
Start at the County gate just south of the parking<br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
Head east on this logging road for appoximately 20<br/>
minutes as a horse would briskly walk, but not trot.<br/>
<br/>
You will see a sign for Hobart Trail off the right<br/>
hand edge of the road.<br/>
<br/>
Take this trail. Stay on the main trail unless<br/>
otherwise directed.<br/>
<br/>
You will encounter an area of burnt logs and stumps.<br/>
Take the trail that goes DOWN from here (southish).<br/>
<br/>
After approximately 4 to 5 minutes, you will come to a<br/>
very small clearing after blue and yellow streamers.<br/>
Take the trail that goes to the right.<br/>
<br/>
After approximately 6 minutes, you will come to<br/>
another gravel access road. Take a left and head up<br/>
the hill.<br/>
<br/>
After about 6 minutes of getnly winding to the north<br/>
and east, the grade starts to steepen.<br/>
<br/>
When you come to another gravel road that is marked<br/>
"Trail," follow it to the right (east).<br/>
<br/>
When you reach a pile of gravel, the road changes into<br/>
a trail. Follow the trail<br/>
<br/>
About 3:20 from the gravel pile, you will come to a<br/>
small snag/cut tree on the right edge of the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Go about 15 human paces further down the trail.<br/>
<br/>
On the right side of the trail there are rocks edging<br/>
the trail. Across from the rocks on the left side of<br/>
the trail is a cluster of 3 alder trees.<br/>
<br/>
Your treasure is in the crook of the trees under the<br/>
leaves.<br/>
<br/>
Please make sure the box is well hidden under the<br/>
leaves after you have logged in.<br/>
<br/>
Look for clues for my next box to start from Alder<br/>
Box.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
i just found out yesterday that the county has closed<br/>
the trails for the winter.<br/>
<br/>
this box is still accessible, though, without<br/>
violating the trail closure too much.<br/>
<br/>
all of the roads in the park are still open.<br/>
<br/>
i will post "winter" clues to get to the box later<br/>
this week. i just need to ride the route to get<br/>
appoximate times.<br/>
<br/>
you will have to use one small secion of trail towards<br/>
the end, but it is a nice gravel trail and will be<br/>
fine for pedestrian traffic.<br/>
<br/>
the major modification will be where to park. this<br/>
will significantly shorten the amout of time it takes<br/>
to get to the box, as well.<br/>
