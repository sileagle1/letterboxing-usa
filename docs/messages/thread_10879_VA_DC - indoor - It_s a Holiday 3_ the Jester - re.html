It's a Holiday 3: the Jester <br/>
Confirmed MIA Feb 9, 2003 <br/>
<br/>
Placed by Scarab of the Doubtful Guests <br/>
December 13, 2002 <br/>
New Valentine stamp 1/14/2, MIA 2/9/3 <br/>
Replaced with the Jester 2/21/3 and clues altered. <br/>
Arlington County <br/>
Arlington, Virginia <br/>
Hand made stamp <br/>
Easy, indoors <br/>
<br/>
Twas the nightmare before Christmas <br/>
And all through the mall <br/>
Anxious shoppers were rushing <br/>
Praying Pentagon City had it all. <br/>
I arrived by the Metro <br/>
And went straight to the top <br/>
To consult with the Wizard <br/>
And visit his shop. <br/>
Puzzling place. Puzzling Wizard. <br/>
"Which it's the number of brown tiles between our doorway you wants." <br/>
"For what, want for what?" <br/>
"Only Santy Claws and that Scarab fellow know and neither one of them <br/>
is telling me. <br/>
Go ask that Joseph at the bank around the corner. <br/>
That's the place to look if he deposited somethin' int it?" <br/>
Joseph, I discovered, was full of hang ups. <br/>
"I haven't a clue," he answered to my enquiries, <br/>
"but you remind me of that puzzling fellow I saw the other day. <br/>
He walked away from our window around the curve of the balcony <br/>
counting the small potted  trees. <br/>
Did it several times like he was trying to be sure of something. <br/>
I don't know how long those trees have been there myself, <br/>
Nor how long they'll stay." <br/>
One, two, three ... Finally I sat on the right side of a long white <br/>
bench with a fine view. <br/>
Behind me immediately over my right shoulder was a mall map. <br/>
Across the wide atrium from me the glass elevator rose and fell. <br/>
Almost directly below me I gazed down the tree at Santa on his golden <br/>
chair. <br/>
"Wow, a natural Santa." <br/>
"What's an unnatural Santa, Dad?" <br/>
I reached down between my knees as if I was pulling up my sock, <br/>
And surreptitiously reached under the frontof the bench. <br/>
"May I help you?" asked the guard suspiciously. <br/>
"OH, um, I thought I lost my keys" I said while holding the fuzzy <br/>
velcro covered, black, dual film cannisters in one hand, <br/>
"Wait, here they are in my other pocket." <br/>
"Alright then, happy holidays to you." <br/>
"And to you." Whew. <br/>
I spent a pleasant time recording in the scroll and enjoying the <br/>
expansive view. <br/>
Then I went all the way around and all the way down to celebrate in <br/>
the food court. <br/>
Merry letterboxing to all, and to all a good hike. <br/>
<br/>
It's now long after Christmas but who wants to let go of the <br/>
holidays. Now when you look  down at the food court below, the <br/>
Christmas tree is gone; instead you are looking at the  center of an <br/>
octagonal tile pattern. But hey, there is always another holiday <br/>
coming up. I  have made "It's a Holiday" a seasonal box with changing <br/>
stamps.  The Royal French Court Fashion Valentine went M.I.A.  I <br/>
placed a new microbox with the next holiday stamp and changed the <br/>
location slightly. Now showing: "It's a Holiday 3: the Jester". <br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet. Please do not turn over benches or look like <br/>
you're searching all over if you're not sure. It may go M.IA. again. <br/>
I will note so here. If you find this letterbox  missing or damaged <br/>
or are puzzled about the clues write theDoubtfulGuests@yahoo.com. <br/>
