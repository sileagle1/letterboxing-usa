                    <div class="plaintext-content">Found a great art supply store in Richmond, VA, this week that <br/>
carries lots of Speedball stuff, including some stuff I'd never seen <br/>
anywhere else. You probably already go there, but in case you <br/>
don't . . .<br/>
<br/>
It's called Plaza, and it's in the VCU area at 927 W. Grace St. The <br/>
phone number is 359-5900. Hours are something like 8:30-6 Monday thru <br/>
Friday and 12-5 on Saturdays. A sign at the register said art <br/>
students and professional artists got a 15% discount on their entire <br/>
order, yet the woman that rang me up said that everyone gets the <br/>
discount because "you must be an artist of some type if you're <br/>
shopping here!"<br/>
<br/>
Plaza had all three sizes of the pink stuff. It also had all the <br/>
sizes of blades I'd seen before plus a no. 6 that the package says is <br/>
for fine details. Haven't tried it yet, but it was only like $2.65 <br/>
for two, so I snatched that up. And I was stoked to see a package <br/>
containing a blade assortment paired with a plastic handle. The <br/>
unfamiliar no. 6 was in this set, along with the more common nos. 1 <br/>
and 2 as well as one or two others, I think. (Wish I'd seen this set <br/>
last year when I first became addicted!) And the starter kits that <br/>
we've all probably seen at Michael's are also there.<br/>
<br/>
Another sweet area is the paper aisle. Plaze had lots of the 3x5, <br/>
yellow, spiral-bound sketch books that folk like to put in their <br/>
boxes for logbooks. The larger versions that I've seen a lot of <br/>
boxers using as their personal logbooks were also abundant. But the <br/>
special paper! It was too much! Great heavy card stock in all colors <br/>
and patterns that could be used to make handmade logbooks. The <br/>
pricier but even lovelier sheets of handmade paper were also a sight <br/>
to behold. And are you sitting down? There were even sheets of fur <br/>
and fake animal skin in case you wanted to give your logbook that <br/>
tactile feel!<br/>
<br/>
Plaza also has a clearance section, and until June 1, a lot of stuff <br/>
throughout the store is 25% off. (None of the Speedball stuff <br/>
unfortunately.)<br/>
<br/>
What's not to love?<br/>
