Clothespin Box in Hanover County, Virginia. I visited this box today<br/>
with the clues from letterboxing.org in hand and found it no problem<br/>
strictly by following the clues. I feared that I had written "right"<br/>
when it should have said "left" or something like that, but I hadn't. <br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry that several of us have had trouble locating the box; take<br/>
heart, because two boxers have found the box since it was planted in<br/>
late January. The box is most definitely within public park boundaries<br/>
and NOT on private land, as some boxers have wondered.<br/>
<br/>
I want my boxes found often and to have their logbooks filled to the<br/>
brim, and I was very concerned when I kept hearing that boxer after<br/>
boxer couldn't find it. Contact me if you have any other questions,<br/>
and good luck! <br/>
