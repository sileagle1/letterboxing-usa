<br/>
  I apologize in advance for this post, I am not trying to offend anyone of any particular political leaning, I promise. But I felt that since we all spend our time outdoors, enjoying the woods, this impacts each and every one of us. There was an article in the national section of my paper about a proposal by the current administration in DC to put over 300 thousand acres of National Forests up to sale. The money raised would supposedly go to local schools and municipalities to offset shortfalls due to gov't budget cuts. I am appalled by this. I will not go into all of the things I feel our gov't should have or could have done to better manage the Nat'l budget. But I think this proposal is not the right answer. If you are concerned as well, contact your state representative and let them know. Fortunately, lawmakers in the western and northwestern states are already up in arms over this. Hopefully this will not pass. I understand the need to find creative ways to keep the country<br/>
 running, but there are so many other things that can be done. I will not list them here, again I do not want to offend. Yes, I am an unabashed tree-hugger. But seriously, if we leave no places left to play, if we sell off and develop everything, what's left? I will not list all of the reasons forests are good for the environment, our air and animal populations. What about the sheer joy of hiking in a tall green wood in the summer, or the same forest ablaze in the fall? Small municipal "pocket parks" are simply not enough. Anyway, I am done, now back to your regularly scheduled program.... <br/>
