The Fisher King Letterbox<br/>
Planted by GBHeron<br/>
On November 10, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Location: Connor's Pond, Petersham, MA (Worcester County)<br/>
<br/>
Trail: even-leveled path, easy<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Fairly easy but not explicit<br/>
<br/>
Getting There from points North:  From exit 17 off Rte 2, take Rte <br/>
32S for 6 miles to Petersham center or from exit 21 off Rte 2, take <br/>
101S for about 7 miles to 32S to Petersham center.  Just past <br/>
Petersham center, 122S joins 32S.  Take a left here staying on 32S <br/>
and 122S (Barre Rd).  Continue on this road for 2 miles until you see <br/>
a pond on your left and the "Swift River Reservation" sign on your <br/>
right.  Take the immediate left at the end of the pond onto Pat <br/>
Connor Rd. [Continue straight onto the dirt road passing the large <br/>
brown "Enjoy Connor's Pond" sign to your left.  Park in first or <br/>
second parking area by the pond on your left.]<br/>
<br/>
Getting There from points South:  Take the Mass Pike to Exit 8 in <br/>
Palmer or take Rte 9 to Ware.  From either, take Rte 32N up through <br/>
the villages of Gilbertville and Wheelwright to Barre.  (From Barre <br/>
center continue on 32N towards Petersham for about 5  miles.  Take a <br/>
right onto Pat Connor Rd immediately before the pond. Continue with <br/>
directions in brackets above.)<br/>
<br/>
Getting There from Worcester:  Take 122N to Barre.  Continue with <br/>
directions in parentheses above.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Onward and northeastward<br/>
Through this quest you will prevail<br/>
Your treasure will lie hidden<br/>
Near the dotted blue shore trail<br/>
<br/>
Kingfishers tunnel deeply<br/>
Into banks both dark and dank<br/>
But Fisher King is nestled<br/>
Midst nine tree trunks by the bank<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  And don't forget to read the Waiver of Responsibility and <br/>
