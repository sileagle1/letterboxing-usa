Oh, gosh, I see that you are *way* down on the list to receive it.  I <br/>
can see your point.  I can feel your pain.  Heck, I can feel *my* <br/>
pain.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I<br/>

<br/>
Two words - Delivery Confirmation.  I have found that in my <br/>
experience, if Delivery Confirmation is used when sending PLBs, they <br/>
get there.  If it is not used, maybe it will get there.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the Boo Boo box was a 10" by 14" by 3" Sterilite plastic <br/>
container inside a cardboard box filled with packing peanuts, so it <br/>
isn't as if it could have slipped behind a sofa cushion.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
I am still dumbfounded as to why the Boo Boo Box took so long to go <br/>
from person to person before it finally disappeared.  Since it was <br/>
launched in March, I would have thought it would have made it through <br/>
the rounds by now - but I guess that didn't happen.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, well.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yep, Delivery Confirmation was one of our better ideas.  :-)  A whole <br/>
lot fewer "Oh, I never received it!"s when for the price of a little <br/>
more than a couple of quarters, the sender can say "Oh yes you did."  <br/>
Tends to keeps a lot more people honest these days.  I'd say close to <br/>
90% of the packages I deliver nowadays are Delivery Confirmation.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm not saying that the occasional package doesn't go astray.  <br/>
With the millions we handle, a few are going to either go astray or <br/>
get damaged.  But it's sure surprising how many fewer packages are <br/>
reported going astray these days when the receiver knows that a click <br/>
on a website will show the sender if the delivery was made. :-) <br/>
