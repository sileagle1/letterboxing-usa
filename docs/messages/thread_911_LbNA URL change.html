Our Letterboxing North America website has changed its location, and <br/>
you may need to make a change in your bookmarks/favorites files.<br/>
<br/>
The new host site address is<br/>
<br/>
http://pil.net/~malenkai/lbna/clues/<br/>
<br/>
If you have www.letterboxing.com bookmarked as the address, you don't <br/>
need to make a change; that address points to the new site.<br/>
<br/>
This change of the main host site is from Mitch Klink's server to <br/>
Randy Hall's server. A group of us decided this change was necessary <br/>
because Mitch has been so busy this year and has been unable to keep <br/>
up with posting clues and links. We were afraid people would get <br/>
discouraged with the site when their clues weren't posted promptly.<br/>
<br/>
Randy has already done a lot of work getting unposted clues and links <br/>
in place. John de Wolf, Jay Drew, and I are going to help with the <br/>
remainder. Erik and Susan David are participating in our discussions <br/>
of what kind of system we need to establish to make our site work <br/>
more smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
If you are aware of clues that should be posted and have not been, or <br/>
find mistakes in our links, please let any one of us know and we will <br/>
try to get them up and right.<br/>
<br/>
A recurring problem for our site is that the main pages and <br/>
supporting state and regional maps are hosted on individual sites - <br/>
first Dan's, then Mitch's and mine, now Randy's and mine. People <br/>
usually don't want to give out their own site's password to other <br/>
people, and that means that no one else can really update the pages. <br/>
It becomes a very large burden for the person responsible.<br/>
<br/>
A solution we are discussing is the establishment of a host site <br/>
just for LbNA. The password could be shared by a larger number of web <br/>
managers. We are currently thinking about the financial and legal <br/>
implications of that solution. Your feedback would be welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, for the time being, we think you will like the speed of <br/>
Randy's site, and the fact that clues are being posted in a more <br/>
timely fashion.<br/>
<br/>
We tried to involve Mitch in this decision, but could get no response <br/>
from him. All of us are hoping that he has not lost interest in <br/>
letterboxing and that he will be able to rejoin us as a web manager <br/>
when his studies are over. There are few people who have done more <br/>
for our site than he has.<br/>

&gt; Our Letterboxing North America website has changed its location, and<br/>
&gt; you may need to make a change in your bookmarks/favorites files.<br/>
<br/>
Just some notes.  If you have clues (or links) on the site and want <br/>
them modified or removed from the site, just e-mail the list.  The<br/>
assumption I guess was that if they were ok on one server they'd <br/>
be ok on a different one for the time being, while we sort out hosting<br/>
and webmastering resources, but that may not always be the case.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you want clues added to the site, e-mail the text or a link<br/>
to your site to the whole list.  This is a better approach because an<br/>
archive of the clue remains in e-groups, in case the server is down or<br/>
the webmasters are awol.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I guess the assumption has always been that if you post clues<br/>
or links to the list then it was ok to put them on the LbNA site.<br/>
If this is untrue let somebody know (a note to this effect should<br/>
prolly go on the site) and somebody will remove the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Rights to the clues of course are always assumed to be owned by<br/>
the author.<br/>
