Park and Rick's Farm Series (both hidden in the park) was about a <br/>
month ago.  I didn't check ALL of them, but these are the statuses I <br/>
know about:  (Note: I have found these in the past, so I do know the <br/>
correct places to look.  If the boxes are still there, they're no <br/>
longer in their original hiding places.)<br/>

<br/>
What have I found that you thought was missing?  =)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of difficult to find letterboxes....  I finally found <br/>
Possum's Penthouse of the Rock Creek Neighborhood Series today! *honk <br/>
honk*  Didn't find it my first time around, but I found it this time, <br/>
darn it.  I still didn't find the Coon's Cache letterbox, though, and <br/>
I'm SURE I'm looking in the right spot for it.  Any reports on <br/>
whether it's missing or not?<br/>
<br/>
And finally, the Dragon Box of the Rock Creek Neighborhood <br/>
Series....  I went with a friend who was looking for it today and she <br/>
got to the right spot, but neither of us were able to find it.  I've <br/>
found it before, so I know it's the right location, but the "branch <br/>
pile" mentioned in the clue has become a "branch graveyard" several <br/>
inches thick over a very wide area.  It looks like they've been <br/>
pruning the trees out there and left all the old branches behind.  <br/>
(The needles on them were still green, in fact!)  So I strongly <br/>
suspect the box is still there, but it's a LOT harder to find under <br/>
the tons of branches and needles recently showing up there.  Bring <br/>
plenty of gloves and friends (to help!) when you go looking for this <br/>
box!  =)<br/>

PS. As a general rule of thumb, if you're certain you're looking in <br/>
the right place for a box and you don't find it within 5 minutes, <br/>
you're probably either looking in the wrong spot (despite how <br/>
absolutely certain you are you've got the right place) or the box is <br/>
missing.  Nine times out of ten, one of those two things explains why <br/>
it took longer than 5 minutes for me to find the box.<br/>

Well this helps a lot.  We found #1 but we were looking in the wrong spot <br/>
for #2.  That trail is closed till the end of September now though.<br/>

We'll have to try and find these ones too.<br/>

Great.  Thanks for the helpful hints.  I am excited to go out and try again.<br/>
