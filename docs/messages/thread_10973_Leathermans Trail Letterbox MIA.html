I made my way up to the Leathermans Cave, where it all began and it <br/>
appears he is either MIA or wintering over in Florida!! <br/>
I crawled under the ledge with a flashlight and explored inside and <br/>
around the cave just incase he was just moved around. No luck. Maybe <br/>
he will turn up again in the spring.<br/>
I was so looking forward to adding him to my book. <br/>
I even tried finding the "chunk o' quartz" letterbox so I didn't go <br/>
home empty handed but after almost sliding head first down the cliff <br/>
I thought I better come back in the spring for that one too. <br/>
<br/>
It was a great trek however, and mine were the only footprints on the <br/>
blue trail!<br/>
