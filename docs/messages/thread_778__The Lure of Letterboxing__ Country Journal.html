 What about the Year 2000?  According to the Bible there was approximately <br/>
4000 years between Creation and Jesus' Birth (approx. 1000 from Creation to <br/>
the Flood then 3000 to Jesus' Birth)... There is a lot of hype about the new <br/>
millennium; can we expect the apocalypse?  Check out this site to answer <br/>

Wendy Williams and I went out to find my letterbox this past summer.  I<br/>
haven't seen the article.  It actually came out during the holidays and by<br/>
the time I got to the book store to get it, they were sold out.   Wendy is a<br/>
wonderful writer who has gained recognition in the travel, ecotourism.<br/>

couple of books on best bike paths in New England and has had numerous<br/>
articles.  Look for her in Audubon soon on a fascinating piece on ocelots in<br/>

I find this quite common these days.  We usually supply the<br/>
reporter/editor or whomever with a fact sheet just to be sure.<br/>
<br/>
I went looking for Country Journal at B&amp;N yesterday.... didn't see it,<br/>

<br/>
If you know that someone is writing about Letterboxing USA or about your own <br/>
boxes, it's a good idea to ask them to run their copy by you before they submit <br/>
it to their editor. That way, you can correct errors before they get into print.  <br/>
You'd be surprised how little fact checking gets done on a tight deadline!<br/>

are you the logical one to do it? <br/>

&gt; I have requested permission to reproduce this article from the magazine.<br/>
It's a lovely little article written by Wendy Williams.  I think this may be<br/>
Rae's friend.  If it is, my thanks to Rae.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hopefully, in a matter of days, we'll get permission to reproduce the<br/>
article (Country Journal does not seem to have an online presence yet) and<br/>
we can create a page to share the article with our com&gt;<br/>

Sounds good, John. Thanks for following up on this!<br/>

&gt;  Since it does contain those couple of errors, I'll transcribe the article and make a page out of it (with correct URL's).  I should be able to get it posted by Tuesday morning.  (I'd do it this weekend but the magazine is at the office.<br/>

Thanks, John. The magazine (Country Journal) USED to be published in VT<br/>
- -not sure of where, nor how far it it distributed.  Nice t make it<br/>
available to all.<br/>
<br/>
Also thanks to Rae, for getting it published in the first place, then<br/>
following up with the corrections to the author.<br/>
<br/>
Brrr  ..  too cold for letterboxing. Enjoy the sunshine!<br/>

Happy New Year<br/>
<br/>
Just a quicky ..As I've been in (and out of ) hospital with pneumonial<br/>
influenza since 18th Dec...( England is in the grip of an epidemic .. Just<br/>
in case it's not news in the US ..many 100's died..but luckily not me ) <br/>
so I've missed a lot of LbNA stories...<br/>
<br/>
Did the "Lure of Letterboxing" item get put up on egroups? ..have I missed<br/>
it ? or is it on the web site..I'll go look-see! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Also do pls tell ..what is the X in PF rating...<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes <br/>

Below is an excerpt from http://www.egroups.com/group/letterbox-usa/247<br/>

<br/>
&gt;X????  One of the things I enjoy most about this hobby is the ability<br/>
&gt;to both give (P) and take (F) as we place and find boxes.  Now I've<br/>
&gt;found a third dimension: meeting fellow letterboxers and exchanging (X)<br/>
&gt;personal stamps, among other things.<br/>

Hi Thom...best wishes to ya !<br/>
<br/>
(I actually meant to send this "off list" ..I apologise to have sent this<br/>
"sick note " to all)<br/>
<br/>
I do, however, sincerely hope you ( and all in the USA ) miss this<br/>
particular variant of the nasty littlt flu bug !...it is not funny at all<br/>
<br/>
I'm a relatively healthy sorta person...and ...I'd never had the flu<br/>
before...I thought it was just a "bad cold"..Well you can believe me, "It<br/>
aint " :-((  <br/>
<br/>
Well thanks for the kind thought...and as they say ..I've now "been there<br/>
..done that ..." so never again !<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What do you hear from Adrian?  He hasn't checked in lately.<br/>
<br/>
Adrian has quite vanished...<br/>
His web site is still there...<br/>
His email pop/smtp pair are still alive at his ISP...but ...<br/>
I am "informed" that no messages have originated there for some time....!<br/>
His phone number is now disconnected....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
No reply to Xmas cards and earlier letters and emails..<br/>
Dont know what else I can add here ..sadly...<br/>
Am down in Dartmoor in the spring ..I may get a moment to call in at<br/>
Okehampton then<br/>
<br/>
I do hope he is well ... and equally to all..."A healthy 2000" <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes<br/>
<br/>
Graham Howard<br/>
