realized it was opening day of firearm season for deer hunting.  Even <br/>
though we were headed to a state nature area, it borders lots of <br/>
private land/timber.  We decided it wasn't a good idea to be tromping <br/>
through the woods.  Probably nothing would have happened, but it isn't <br/>
worth the risk.  Later when I mentioned this to my father (after he <br/>
returned from hunting) he said we did the right thing.  Most hunters <br/>
are careful but accidents do happen. <br/>
<br/>
You might want to keep tabs on hunting season in your area as a <br/>
precaution. <br/>
