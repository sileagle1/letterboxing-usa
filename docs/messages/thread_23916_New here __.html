It's fine, but you may also want to carry some larger paper or <br/>
cardstock with you.  We've run across some very large stamps that <br/>
wouldn't fit on an index card.  There are also some series of stamps <br/>
that fit together like a puzzle to form a larger overall image that <br/>
wouldn't fit on a 3.5" x 5" card.<br/>

I always stamp on 3x5 cards.  I think they are easier to deal with <br/>
than a book, and if the impression doesn't come out quite right, you <br/>
can just throw the card away and start over.  And if the stamp is <br/>
large, you don't have to worry about the crease in the book, which <br/>
can get in the way sometimes.  Also, you can arrange the cards any <br/>
way you want - by state, chronologically, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see you at a gathering sometime in the future - I live in <br/>
NW Indiana.  Also, if you haven't done so, you should join the Great <br/>
Lakes group: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/<br/>

&gt;   Hello all.<br/>
&gt; Found my first letterbox today... even got a hitchhiker letter box<br/>
&gt; as a bonus... not bad for a first one. Stamp I found was large and<br/>
&gt; very well done. I waited to hunt until I had lurked the site a bit<br/>
&gt; and had a chance to make my own stamp. Got the stamp done last<br/>
&gt; night and went out to get an easy firstie on lunch from work today.<br/>
&gt; I have quite a history as an active geocacher... but... have only<br/>
&gt; been superficially aware of letterboxing as its honorable parent.<br/>
&gt; I like the stamp collecting appeal of letterboxing and the craft<br/>
&gt; side of making my own stamp. I have a plan in mynd for my first<br/>
&gt; letterbox hide. I have hidden and maintain approx 30 geocaches, so<br/>
&gt; I think I have a good idea as to what I am in for here...<br/>
&gt; I will wait to do my first placment until I have found a few and<br/>
&gt; am "experienced".<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Question?<br/>
&gt; My idea is to collect my stamps on 3 1/2 X 5 index cards that I can<br/>
&gt; put in am album as opposed to carring around a journal with ALL<br/>
&gt; my "found" stampings in it... I would record info about the hunt,<br/>
&gt; date, location, etc. on the card next to the stamp... What is the<br/>
&gt; community thought on this?<br/>
&gt; TY all.<br/>
&gt; Hope to meet a few of you on the trail... from the listings, I know<br/>
&gt; a few of you already from the caching community in my area (N<br/>
&gt; Chicago suburbs)<br/>
&gt; eyesseit... also my profile name on GC.com<br/>
