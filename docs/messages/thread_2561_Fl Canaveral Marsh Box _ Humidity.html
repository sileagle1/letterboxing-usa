Well since I hadn't been responsible enough to use zip-locks I can't <br/>
answer that question completely. However, both boxes I used are <br/>
tupperware type containers and had moisture in them. I don't think it <br/>
is likely a direct rain leak, but humidity in the air that is <br/>
managing to get inside when they are opened or through small leaks in <br/>
the seal. I will likely be in SW Florida over July 4th holidays and <br/>
plan to try to find your boxes. I'll report on their condition.<br/>

Hey Eric,<br/>
<br/>
Definitely double bag in ziplocks...  Virtually ALL off my letterboxes are<br/>
in rubbermaid type containers.  Even though they appear to be weatherproof<br/>
and remain sealed, they still end up with a noticeable amount of water when<br/>
I check in the them.  The added protection of the ziplocks has kept all<br/>
contents very dry.<br/>

Thanks for the suggestion. I guess you guys up that way are the rain <br/>
experts for sure. Seems to almost always be raining in the Northwest <br/>
from what I hear. I will zip-lock from now on. However, I think I'll <br/>
try the silica in case someone fails to seal everything back in the <br/>
bag when stamping in.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just returned from a cache (sister sport) I placed in October last year.<br/>
They're a bit larger but ammo boxes work quite well out in the rain. This<br/>
cache had been sealed in October and didn't have a drop of water inside.<br/>
Even made a whoosh noise when I opened it.<br/>
<br/>
There are smaller ammo boxes so it's a good option for a letterbox. I also<br/>
use a zip loc bag since, like Portland, it does get quite rainy in and<br/>
around Seattle. In my case it's more for the time when folks are retrieving<br/>
the logbook than when it's sitting inside the box.<br/>
<br/>
I've heard of folks using silica in their caches but I believe it's only<br/>
really good for minor moisture and mildew. Probably a good idea for the<br/>
logbook Zip-loc, but I wouldn't plunk it in a tupperware container.<br/>

I'd be curious to find about how that works out. I purchased some silica at<br/>
a local craft store. It is packaged for preserving flowers.  I guess the<br/>
challenge would be putting this bulk stuff into a semi-permeable bag....<br/>
<br/>
...hmmm...<br/>
