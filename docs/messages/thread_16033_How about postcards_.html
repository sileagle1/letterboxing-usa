                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a thought that occured to me reviewing the 'letterboxing in a <br/>
war zone discussion.'  How about an effort for letterboxers anywhere <br/>
to send postcards with their personal stamp images to interested <br/>
soldiers in a war zone???  Sort of like was done for the Vermont <br/>
Viking before his death.  I'm all for sending carving supplies or <br/>
anything else to make life nicer for our guys over there but the <br/>
thought of terrorists planting exploding letterboxes here, there, and <br/>
everywhere scares me to death.  Maybe the soldiers could carve their <br/>
stamps and send the images to someone back here who could scan them <br/>
and post them where we all could enjoy them?  Just thinking out loud.<br/>
