Connecticut.   (MY second visit - but first with family)  My daughter <br/>
located it - and was as excited as could be.  Just one comment is <br/>
that is wasn't very well hidden - and given the traffic, those who <br/>
visit in the future may want to put a little more into covering the<br/>
box.  <br/>
<br/>
Condition was good - with stamp/pad and ink all in fine shape.<br/>
<br/>
A recent "boxer" appears to have used fingerprints (I have a suspicion<br/>
that they "found" letterboxing by noticing the box uncovered.) <br/>
Pretty neat<br/>
approach - certainly better than keeping the stamp or tossing it.  <br/>
<br/>
Also - noticed we "just missed" a couple of hitchhikers...maybe next<br/>
time!<br/>
Peace,<br/>

Hi Aili<br/>
Just a note to tell you that on Thursday morning at about 9:30  all the rocks
and twigs were in place. Three of us walked the trail and I went to make
a quick check--it was fine then and I could not see the box.  Do you think
the animals are using your stash for their nests<span class="moz-smiley-s3"><span> ;-) </span></span><br/>

and make no mistake - I was able to clearly see it beside the tree -    <br/>
I found myself thinking "Where the heck did all the rocks go?!"  <br/>
