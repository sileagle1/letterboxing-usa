I am finally recovering from my cold and am eager to get out and <br/>
box!  The rain has put a definite damper in that activity - so I <br/>
console myself by carving instead.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Grumpy and I are about to embark on another cross-country road trip <br/>
with lots of letterboxing thrown in for good measure.  Crossing I-10 <br/>
to Florida then up to New Hampshire where we will linger for <br/>
awhile.  It should be interesting to search for boxes in the snow.  <br/>
I can't believe that we lived there for over 11 years and didn't <br/>
know about letterboxing.  So many boxes that might have been found...<br/>
<br/>
We will maintain our contact through this group and look forward to <br/>
the late March (or early April) gathering.  In the meantime, happy <br/>
letterboxing New Year to all of you.<br/>

My Apologies - this was intended for the Northern California List.  <br/>
However, we'd love to hear from other boxers in New England with <br/>
advice, suggestions on boxing in the snow.<br/>

Hey Grumpy Grinch<br/>
<br/>
   I see you'll be coming through my neck of the woods, New <br/>
Orleans,LA, on your trip.  Just wanted to let you know that we have <br/>
alot more boxes in Louisiana than the LbNA site shows.  They are in <br/>
the data base but don't show up on regular searches.  I'll be glad <br/>
to walk you through the process of finding our clues, it's not hard <br/>
but is different than all the other states.  If you want we could <br/>
hook up for a drink in the French Quarter and do an exchange.  I'm <br/>
sure a few other boxers would be glad to meet up also.  Feel free to <br/>
email me off list Subject:  N O Trip.<br/>
