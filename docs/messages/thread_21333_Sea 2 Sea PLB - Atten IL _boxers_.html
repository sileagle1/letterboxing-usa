Well the Sea 2 Sea box has arrived in IL. This PLB is going to all<br/>
50 states but is only stopping in one location at each state. I am<br/>
the lucky recipient for IL. I am willing to have a mini-gathering on<br/>
Saturday, February 5th (a day before my birthday - yahoo) for all<br/>
those that want to stamp in to the PLB.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like to meet Saturday afternoon, please email me off list at<br/>
mlbarrick@y... and I'll set up a time and location. I live in<br/>
Chicago so I'd like to limit the location to the Chicagoland area.<br/>
Those who'd like to travel in are more than welcome. Please respond<br/>
by Friday so I can let all those who want to stamp in know.<br/>
<br/>
