                    <div class="plaintext-content">Eric Eurto mentioned hoping to get to Dartmoor someday. I think, for all of <br/>
us American letterboxers, that would be the holy grail. Which leads me to a <br/>
suggestion. Perhaps, through this Board, some of us could coordinate and <br/>
make a trip there together. As with all things of this nature, a date <br/>
pretty far in the future should be picked so that people can make plans. <br/>
Not to mention save for it. Even if only 3 to 5 people went, it would still <br/>
be a fun time. Keeping the itinerary over there flexible would probably <br/>
work better too.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt I would have the chance to get over there for a few years, but <br/>
others might be more inclined. It sure would make for some good reports <br/>
too, when you all got back. An idea, maybe a stupid one, but there you have it.<br/>

Perhaps a trip to Hawaii as well? Maybe our next LBNA Gathering could be in<br/>

Hello All
<br/>    The Space Travellers are going on a Christmas pilgrimage
to Dartmoor. (Is this some kind of religous mixed metaphor?) Graham has
been an invaluable help in suggesting a good place to stay and how to get
the correct map of the park, as well as lots of other important details.
Unfortunately, we will only be there for about two and a half days, but
we hope to score a good number of boxes, and perhaps even place one. You
may be sure that I will give the list a full report when we return.
<br/>    When we made plans to travel last summer, I didn't
even know about letterboxing. Now we are going on a Haj.

</p><p>BTW do Dartmoor boxes count in my P/F tally?
