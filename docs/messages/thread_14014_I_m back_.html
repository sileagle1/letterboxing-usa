I am so glad I went.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who posted on my debate on an international plant.  I can't<br/>
write right now, but to let you know . . . Paris was a total bust as far as<br/>
letterboxing goes.  I thought it would be easier since I found several<br/>
listings for letterboxes on a urban letterboxing page.  The locations were<br/>
awful and one in particular nearly got me in trouble.  And as for Jerusalem,<br/>
I had pretty much decided not to make a plant, but I took a microbox just in<br/>
case and carried it with me.<br/>
<br/>
Well . . . I am excited to say that I found a place to plant that is<br/>
perfectly safe for all involved and  should hopefully last!  I was so<br/>
happy-it's my first international plant and may well have been the first box<br/>
in the country.  I haven't been able to find listings for any others.<br/>
<br/>
I will write again later and share more details, but I need to run for now.<br/>

ps. I was sorry to read about Erik's passing.  I lost an uncle to melanoma<br/>
last year.  I know that it can be devastating.  My thoughts and prayers go<br/>
out to his family. <br/>
