letterboxes at Goddard Park, in Warwick, RI.  <br/>
<br/>
The history of Rhode Island is closely tied to some of the most famous pirates<br/>
of the late 17th century.  Famous pirate captains such as Blackbeard and Kidd<br/>
were known to frequent the area.  Captain Kidd, in particular, was known to<br/>
hide his ill-gotten gains from the colonial government and his crew.  It has<br/>
come to our attention that he might have hidden both a map and a treasure at<br/>
Goddard Park.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!  Make sure that you bring your spyglass and cutlass, and keep an<br/>
eye out for the ghost of Captain Kidd.<br/>
