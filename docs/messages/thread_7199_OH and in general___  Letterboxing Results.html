                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am doing some maintaining of several of my Ohio letterboxes. I have <br/>
learned a few things during the last week:<br/>
<br/>
1. A box placed in the winter may be covered with lots of green <br/>
leaves and harder to find in the summer.<br/>
<br/>
2. Those leaves may be on vines with redish stems and grouped in 3s. <br/>
(poison ivy)<br/>
<br/>
3. The trails of Ohio are filled with cobwebs and spiders that like <br/>
to crawl up the back of my neck here in late August.<br/>
<br/>
4. 90 degrees and 90 percent humidity puts a damper of how far I can <br/>
run through the woods to and from letterboxes. (And a 2 liter bottle <br/>
of diet coke does not last a full afternoon.)<br/>
<br/>
4. Having a colocated geocache/letterbox is a mixed blessing.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the numbers of letterboxing visitors to several of my boxes:<br/>
<br/>
Leave Only Footprints: 4 in 11 months<br/>
<br/>
Adena Mound: 3 in 10 months<br/>
<br/>
Hooked on Phonics (Shavian clue) 0 in 8 months, though I <br/>
corresponded with one seeker.<br/>
<br/>
Lost Fishie (Ohio Mystery) 1 in 7 months<br/>
<br/>
Eagle Pass (Geocache/Letterbox) 18 letterboxers among 41 total <br/>
visitors in 11 months<br/>
<br/>
Narrows and NarrowsII (Geocache/Letterbox) Logbook and stamp taken <br/>
from cache. One letterboxer left their stamp on a piece of paper <br/>
since the log was taken. 4 geocachers wrote their name on the piece <br/>
of paper.. The internet shows 57 visitors to this letterbox/cache. <br/>
<br/>
Geocache LBNA - a geocache where you need a clue from a letterbox to <br/>
find the geocache - 7 letterboxers<br/>
<br/>
... Geocaching may open the letterbox to new finders, but <br/>
increases the vapor pressure of the stamp. <br/>
