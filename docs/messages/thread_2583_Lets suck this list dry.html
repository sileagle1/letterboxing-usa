Frankly, I asked people to respond to me off list only to avoid this <br/>
kind of behavior from you. Had I asked for responses on list, I am <br/>
sure I would have been accused of something else. Anyone is welcome <br/>
to view the links I have collected on my site and obviously can use <br/>
them anywhere else they wish (including LbNA or any personal site). <br/>
The concept that I would try to monopolize the knowledge of links to <br/>
other letterboxing sites is beyond ludicrous. You will not stop me <br/>
from posting to this list by attacking me at every opportunity. I <br/>
will leave it to the list moderators and others to decide how to <br/>
react to your vehemence. I will only correct the misconceptions.<br/>
