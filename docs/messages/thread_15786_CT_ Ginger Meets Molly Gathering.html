                    <div class="plaintext-content">Rustypuff, the Nina Dog, and I would like to add our thanks to the <br/>
chorus of praise heaped upon the organizers of this event.  Chuck, <br/>
Molly, and Chickabirdie did a stupendous job.  It was great to meet <br/>
so many new people and to renew old acquaintances.<br/>
<br/>
Although we didn't have the time to try for any of the established <br/>
boxes on this, our first foray into Connecticut, we did three event-<br/>
only box series and were very impressed with the many quality <br/>
variations on the theme contributed by NeeDeeps, Music Woman, <br/>
Butterfly, Teach &amp; Preach, Irish Tinker, Leader of the Pack, <br/>
Scoutdogs, and Chuck, Molly, and Chickabirdie themselves.  Great <br/>
stamps!<br/>
<br/>
We brought along three hitchhikers (Hourglass, Fingers Crossed, and <br/>
Hairless Troll), and left with Funhog's Ramblin' Rose.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, does anyone know the origin and name of the big stamp <br/>
that was on the table with the hitchhikers?  It depicted a couple of <br/>
rabbits in warrior garb, brandishing swords.  Kim thinks it might be <br/>
a scene from a sci-fi / fantasy book series that features rabbits, <br/>
moles, mice, etc as the main characters.  We'd love to attribute this <br/>
cool stamp to the proper artist.<br/>
<br/>
See y'all at the next gathering!<br/>

to ask him a certain question to obtain this stamp.  But just like <br/>
my "Cootie", it seems to have gotten away from him to run around out <br/>
on it's own for awhile at the gather.  :O)<br/>

Ah!  Thanks!<br/>

You know, that thought crossed my mind, but I never voiced it to <br/>
Rustypuff, so I guess I can't now claim credit for being so astute!<br/>
