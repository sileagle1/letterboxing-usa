<br/>
Baker's Dozen returned tonight from a magical visit to Dartmoor and<br/>
London. Our week went slower than any vacation in recent memory with<br/>
full days boxing on the moors or site seeing in London and wonderful<br/>
pubs at night. We all need a vacation from our vacation!<br/>
<br/>
Our main objective was to visit Cranmere Pool on it's 150th<br/>
Anniversary and we did that on Tuesday. A bonus would have been to<br/>
find and qualify for 100 Dartmoor letterboxes to be eligible for the<br/>
Dartmoor 100 club. <br/>
<br/>
We not only hit the 100 mark, but almost hit the 200! Our Dartmoor<br/>
count is 185 boxes and we had more fun than you can shake a tor at.<br/>
Many more details to come - I was earnest in keeping a journal and<br/>
have daily reports to start posting to our website, beginning Sunday<br/>
evening.<br/>
<br/>
Sue and I hope to take a trip like this again in 2 or 3 years, but I<br/>
think all of those attending have already signed up for the next trip!<br/>
The chemistry and comraderie of this group was nothing short of<br/>
amazing. We have many stories and tons of pictures to share and hope<br/>
you stop by.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
