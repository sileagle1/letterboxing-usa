I've swapped out the video file for Empire (AVI to MPG).  The new format is <br/>
bigger, with a larger file size and download time, but is probably more <br/>
compatible with most players.  Try it and let me know off list if there are <br/>
any more problems with this.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a fifth box in NYC which I haven't finished the clue for yet <br/>
(it's fish, not fruit).  I'll try to get it up tomorrow night.<br/>
<br/>
I should note that security at some of these sites exceeds airport TSA <br/>
standards.  Discretion is imperative.  It's quite possible that some of <br/>
these will have a short shelf life, so act quickly if you want to pluck <br/>
them.  If you get arrested for letterboxing, don't call me for bail.  If <br/>
you're looking for a walk in the park, try Newbie1's NYC box.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, careful out there... the letterboxing police are a minor peril <br/>
compared with other big city dangers.<br/>
