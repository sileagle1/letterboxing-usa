support any library system.  Our county doesn't have a county library.  So<br/>
anyone who lives in an unincorporated area doesn't pay a single dime of<br/>
taxes, either thru their own property tax or thru a landlord paying property<br/>
taxes, that goes to support a library.<br/>
<br/>
In our area, if a person has a library card for one library, they can walk<br/>
into a ton of other libraries in the area and check out books with the card<br/>
they have from their own town's library.  It's a reciprocal service type of<br/>
thing.  They can walk into my town's library, and I can walk into their<br/>
town's library.   But these are people who live in unincorporated areas so<br/>
they have absolutely no library card to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
So if I'm paying to support the library thru my property taxes or thru the<br/>
rent I pay my landlord, why should I be happy if a family who doesn't<br/>
support any libary at all is able to take books out of my town's library?<br/>
<br/>
If the people could afford to live in town, they do.  A lot of them rent in<br/>
unincorporated areas because there are more slumlords in the unincorporated<br/>
areas with cheaper rents and with far less restrictions on occupancy<br/>
numbers.   Right now it's actually occupancy numbers more than rent that are<br/>
THE big thing in our area.  There are poverty level families that will<br/>
squeeze an extended family of 15 or 16 people or more into a two bedroom<br/>
apartment or townhouse.   Or poorer families who own their own homes will<br/>
turn those homes into "boarding houses" for extra weekly cash, something<br/>
that tends to be strictly controlled by towns and villages but not so much<br/>
by the county if the house is in an unincorporated area.  Altho the county<br/>
does at least come down on people who turn their unattached garages into<br/>
"boarding houses" -- if they find out about it.<br/>

$400 a year for a flippin' library card? That's insane! I've gotten<br/>
library cards for all the different library networks in the metro<br/>
Atlanta area, including a university library, and I've never been<br/>
charged anything.<br/>
<br/>
That's insane. I'd relocate just based on that insidious treachery.<br/>

This isn't really LBing, but in the state of Pennsylvania, you can get <br/>
a library card from ANY county, as long as you show them a card from <br/>
your own county.<br/>
