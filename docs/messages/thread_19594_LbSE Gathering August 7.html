<br/>
The 2004 SouthEast Gathering is less than two weeks away - August 7! Everyone <br/>
from everywhere is welcome to attend. It's looking to be a big event, and <br/>
very exciting.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who haven't yet made plans to attend but think you might <br/>
like to come, please check out the Gathering's homepage at <br/>
http://hometown.aol.com/redbng/2004SEG.html for all the details.<br/>
<br/>
The traveling event stamps have arrived, and they are beautiful!<br/>
These stamps have probably seen more gatherings than any of us ever will. <br/>
Some very well-known trail names appear in the logs.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see y'all there!<br/>
