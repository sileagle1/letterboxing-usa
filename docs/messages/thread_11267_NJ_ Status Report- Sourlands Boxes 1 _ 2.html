Box 1 is soaked through.  It might be saved for nostalgic purposes, but the <br/>

Box 2 we didn't find it.  But in all honesty, muddy conditions kind of <br/>
turned us off, call us wimps. :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Those two boxes have been orphaned (We moved from NJ to CA).  Box 1 was <br/>
reported missing some months ago but I guess the news of its demise was <br/>
premature.  We won't be back to NJ anytime in the forseeable future.  <br/>
At one time some kind souls offered to adopt some of my east coast <br/>
boxes.  If anyone wishes to adopt Sourland 1 and 2, (neither box is <br/>
considered to be missing but the condition of box 1 is suspect) please <br/>
contact us.  Thanks. <br/>
