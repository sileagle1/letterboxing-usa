&gt; Wow, whose the one bothered?  Personally I agree with Lori's <br/>
&gt; request.  There is a separate group for postal letterboxing -- use <br/>
&gt; it.  There is no need to post here to try and include everybody.  <br/>
&gt; People who want to be included in postals are at the postal group, <br/>
&gt; the rest of us couldn't give a flying rip about postals.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With a rant like that, all I can say is it's a good thing I didn't <br/>
&gt; accept that moderator job when I had the chance because you'd be <br/>
&gt; gone.  There is absolutely no reason to post like that to anyone, <br/>
&gt; let alone one of the moderators who politely asked you to take <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; business to the group where it belonged (twice).<br/>

 Lori sent one email to you and it was anything but hostile. Stop <br/>

day or so.  I have not at any point insulted you or called you <br/>

I am apalled at the tone that this situation has taken.  Number 1 I <br/>
did not crawl out from under a rock and I hope everyone sees the way <br/>
that you truly are.  I cannot believe this latest email that you <br/>
have sent.  Yes her emails to my personal email were hostile and by <br/>
the way I am not trying to prove a point.  I simply posted an email <br/>
and this is what has happened.  <br/>
