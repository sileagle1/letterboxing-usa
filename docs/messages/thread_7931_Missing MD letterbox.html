&gt; It was around the 14th of August that I found the first 2. This <br/>
was the 3rd and last, the one near the Nature Center. I skipped it <br/>
and just went back to find it yesterday. The clues were clear and <br/>
the site was, I thought, clearly spelled out. It should have been at <br/>
the base of a tree behind the bench, but there was nothing there.<br/>

We didn't find it this past Sunday (22nd), though we were pretty sure <br/>
we were in the right place (tree behind bench with nook, rocks in <br/>
front, etc).<br/>
