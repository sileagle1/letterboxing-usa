&gt; Hi fellow LetterBoxers. We are from Oregon and have gone crazy with <br/>
&gt; this for the last month - it's a great activity to get out and keep the <br/>
&gt; kids busy during the summer!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, my son is spending a week there with his Dad and it would be <br/>
&gt; neat if he could find a couple in another state!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any tips here!<br/>
