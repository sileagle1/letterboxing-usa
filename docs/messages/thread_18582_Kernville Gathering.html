                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to Don and Gwen fun was had by all. This was my first <br/>
gathering, but I can't imagine having more fun. Whitewater rafting, <br/>
great people, great hosts, TONS of letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, as Buzzard reports, I did spill my guts at the Sign Bite site, <br/>
but hey, we got the stamp! Thanks for letting me tag along Buzzard.<br/>
<br/>
Found 16 in all which included 3 hitch hikers (Including a car key <br/>
from a famous letterboxer) The Kernville Dragon slayed me though. <br/>
<br/>
AND.... Got a great shirt made by Don himself.<br/>
<br/>
Don and Gwen you're the best. <br/>
Thanks Again<br/>
