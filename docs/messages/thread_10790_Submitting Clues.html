Name: Erfellie<br/>
Name of Letterbox: Endangered Wildlife<br/>
Placed: January 28, 2003<br/>
State and County: Oregon, Josephine County<br/>
Town: Grants Pass<br/>
Difficulty Level: Very Easy<br/>
<br/>
How to Get there: If your traveling on I-5, get of at exit 55 into Grants <br/>
Pass, at the end of the exit, turn right. You will be traveling on Redwood <br/>
Highway, a large 4 laned beast lined with Applebees, Walmart, Fred Myers, <br/>
Mcdonalds, etc. Follow this highway, do not turn off of it, follow for <br/>
approximately 5 miles until you are near Rogue Community College (Signs from <br/>
I-5 and the exit will direct you there). Turn left at Demeray Drive, there <br/>
will be a large sign that says "East College entrance". Follow this road a <br/>
short distance, maybe a mile, then turn right onto College Drive. Follow <br/>
this small, windy road (being wary of kamikaze squirrels please) a short <br/>
distance and you will reach the campus parking lot. Park.<br/>
<br/>
Finding the Box: After you have parked you car, walk a short distance back <br/>
down College drive (the direction you came from), on the left side of the <br/>
road is a small one lane road leading into campus, there are several yellow <br/>
metal posts lining this road, stand near these posts. To your right, and a <br/>
small distance down the road, is a wooden sign post saying "To Ruckman <br/>
Memorial" with an arrow poiting down a trail. Follow this trail to where it <br/>
forks off, go to the left and when the trail forks again, keep to the left. <br/>
You will go up and down a series of small hills, after approximately 1/4 <br/>
mile you will go up another hill. There will be a large madrone tree bending <br/>
like an archway over the trail about 8 or 9 feet overhead. The madrone forks <br/>
its branches in the middle of the "archway" and there is a large, mossy, <br/>
dead branch that has fallen between its fork, completeing the archway. When <br/>
you are standing under the archway, look to your right, there will be a <br/>
small, twisted madrone tree, to its left is a large mossy, dead tree with <br/>
only 5 small branches. To the left of that is another madrone tree which at <br/>
its base forks into 3 large, healthy branches/trunks so it appears to be <br/>
three seperate trees. At the base of this tree, on the other side of it, you <br/>
will find the box buried beneath debris and sticks. If it is re-hidden <br/>
carefully by letterboxers, there will be a good sized Y shaped branch <br/>
leaning against the madrone over the box. The Y of the branch is directly <br/>
above the box. Happy Hunting :o)<br/>
<br/>
To report the conditions of the box, or to just share stories, or let me <br/>
know the box is missing, or whatnot, feel free to contact me at <br/>
