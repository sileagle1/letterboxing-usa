Minnesota did have some of the earliest letterboxes in the USA, planted by<br/>
Daniel. They have been orphaned for quite a while, and clues to them were<br/>
removed from the site a few weeks ago at Dan'l's request. I don't know of<br/>
any other boxes in the state other than the one we have up.<br/>

&gt; Heading out to Minnesota next month, we are shocked to see only  one<br/>

Well, I was in Minnesota this weekend and placed<br/>
another box in Minneapolis, so at least there is again<br/>
more than one lonely one there. I wish some<br/>
Minnesotans would place more letterboxes! I used to<br/>
live there, but now I feel a little like an outsider<br/>
coming up from Chicago to hide letterboxes when there<br/>
are so few there.  Minnesota has so many interesting<br/>
places that would be perfect for hiding letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
Here are the clues to the new box:<br/>
---------------------------------------<br/>
45th Parallel Letterbox<br/>
Minneapolis, Minnesota, Hennepin County [dear<br/>
webmaster - Hennepin County is actually the one under<br/>
the letters "POLIS" on your map, not the one you have<br/>
highlighted...]<br/>
<br/>
First, take the freeway south to the Equator exit.<br/>
Take a left and then another left. From the Equator,<br/>
start walking toward the North Pole. When you are<br/>
exactly half-way there, you'll come to a place worth<br/>
stopping, at a street intersection overlooking a<br/>
golden valley with a park way off to your left. <br/>
<br/>
Sitting on the boulder here, look back where you<br/>
walked from. Just 30 paces away you'll see three tree<br/>
trunks which come together at the place where the<br/>
letterbox is hidden behind a rock.<br/>
<br/>
As this is an urban location, please camouflage the<br/>
box well when you are putting it back in its hiding<br/>
place, so that it will remain completely hidden from<br/>
passersby and curious neighbors.<br/>

Has it actually been removed?  I know it was still there in November 2000.<br/>
<br/>
The two Pike Island ones were long gone by fall of 2000.<br/>

<br/>
I did my part in 2001, but alas, vandals destroyed my box shortly<br/>
after I placed it.  Unfortunately, being in NH now it's hard to<br/>
replace it.  Next time I'm out I'm recycling the stamp from the<br/>
destroyed box as a hitchhiker.<br/>
