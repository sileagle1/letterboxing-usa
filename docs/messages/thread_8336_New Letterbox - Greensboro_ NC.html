Name of Letterbox:  The Hagon-Stone Letterbox<br/>
Date:  October 12, 2002<br/>
State &amp; County:  North Carolina &amp; Guilford<br/>
Nearest Town:  Greensboro<br/>
<br/>
About 7 miles south of Greensboro on US-421 is Hagan-Stone Regional <br/>
Park named in honor of Annie Hagan and Joseph Stone, leaders in land <br/>
conservation in the Greensboro area.  As you enter the park, you will <br/>
pass an owl statue and a little church on the left side of the road.  <br/>
Follow the sign to Shelter 4-5-6 as you pass the old log cabin.  As <br/>
you pass the playground on the left, look to your right to see <br/>
several peacocks roaming wild around a gray-blue house, and park at <br/>
the end of the paved road.  Start your travels at Chatfield Trail.  <br/>
At the split in the trail, look to your right.  There is a very small <br/>
trail that leads to a quiet small lake.  Enjoy the lake for a while <br/>
before heading back to the trail split.  Take the trail to the left.  <br/>
The forest is full of overhanging oaks, maples, cedars, and pine <br/>
trees and the trail is fairly flat, well groomed, and wide, perfect <br/>
for walking.  As you continue on your way, you will pass two very old <br/>
outhouses (thankfully not in use) and a fork in the trail.  Follow <br/>
the trail to your right.  Stop at the bench and take a rest while <br/>
enjoying the scenery.  As you continue, you will enter a grove of <br/>
cedar tress and a small brook running under the trail.  At the trail <br/>
junction, turn right and follow the path for a distance noticing <br/>
several new houses on the right.  At the next trail junction, <br/>
continue straight (west) until you come to another trail junction.  <br/>
Turn right onto the smaller trail and you will soon see a signpost.  <br/>
Turn left at the sign (a place where you learned as a kid) and climb <br/>
over several fallen trees.  You will see an old log building where <br/>
you will soon find the letterbox you seek.  At the northern corner of <br/>
the building, head north (10 degrees on a compass) for 15 single <br/>
paces to a large stump.  The letterbox is hidden behind the tree's <br/>
roots.  To head back to your car, go to the front of the building and <br/>
head straight (220 degrees) on the trail and over a wood bridge.  <br/>
Continue to the parking lot and then to the paved road.  Turn left <br/>
onto the road and walk to its end where you started.  Finding the <br/>
letterbox will be easy and should take about 60 minutes through a <br/>
very nice quiet park.<br/>
