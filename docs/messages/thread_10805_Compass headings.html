<div>As I was following some directions today that used 
heading (e.g. 20 paces at 300), I kept missing where I was aiming for.  I 
wondered what I was doing wrong when I remembered that my compass has a magnetic 
declination adjustment.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was wondering if the compass headings given in 
directions to boxes are adjusted for magnetic declination or not?  Or does 
it just depend on who is giving the directions.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As a side note, for the first time using a compass, 
I had nearby metal give me a false heading.  I had taken a compass reading 
and moved a few feet closer to a fire hydrant when I noticed that the compass 
had changed direction and was pointing towards the fire hydrant, almost 90 
degrees off north.</div>

<br/>
Almost always the clues are assuming magnetic north and if they <br/>
don't, they'll typically state that in the clue.  Of the hundreds of <br/>
boxes I've tracked down, only two have adjusted for declination and <br/>
in both clues it was explicitly stated.<br/>

Gotta be careful with that.  I had trouble figuring out which corner <br/>
of a bridge was southwest because every corner I went to claimed one <br/>
of the others was the real southwest corner.  *rolling eyes*  Kind of <br/>
makes you want to get a GPS, huh?  *wink*  =)<br/>
