                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the cards from Eaglevile Preserve. We went out today with <br/>
a young friend he found it then we  serviced the box. It was only in <br/>
need of postcards, but Gemma added some of her biscuits as Captain <br/>
had enjoyed the initial  offering. The dogs need to enjoy this too, <br/>
now there is more than squirrels to add excitement to the search. <br/>
<br/>
If not to rainy tommorow I will service the box at Shelter Falls as I <br/>
was sent a card saying the journal was gone. Should have a new one <br/>
there at least by the end of the weekend. Hope you are all having a <br/>
great fall boxing this is sure the weather to enjoy it in. <br/>
