&gt; Following the most spectacular sunset I'd seen in a long time on <br/>
&gt; Friday, <br/>
&gt; Saturday was too nice a day to pass up a hunt in Buffalo for one of <br/>
&gt; JeLyBean's beautiful stamps. <br/>
<br/>
Agreed.  I was checking on "Earth Day" at the time.  Gorgeous sunset <br/>
and a full double rainbow over the pond.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; I noticed that no one had adopted it <br/>
<br/>
*Ahem!*  I've adopted JeLyBean's boxes in WNY.  If you go to my <br/>
website, (http://www-cs.canisius.edu/~salley/Letterboxing) you'll see <br/>
it on my Adopted list.  If you drop a note to JB, I'll get a forward <br/>
from her.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; so I <br/>
&gt; knew the chance of finding it was iffy at best. Although I'm quite <br/>
&gt; (but not totally) sure we followed the clues accurately and were at <br/>
&gt; the right location for the box, we couldn't find it. <br/>
<br/>
It's not an easy find. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; The area looked like it had <br/>
&gt; flooded recently, so the box might be MIA. Does anyone recall <br/>
&gt; seeing <br/>
&gt; this around lately? This is one of three I need to complete this <br/>
&gt; series.<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Ron<br/>
<br/>
I plan on checking all my adoptees over the next couple of weeks,  <br/>
I'll check on it, but it may be awhile, Grad School is keeping me <br/>
busy.<br/>
