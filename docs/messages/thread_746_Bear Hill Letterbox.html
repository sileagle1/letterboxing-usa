Bear Hill Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
A pair of letterboxes on a moderate 5 mile hike, connected just to the<br/>
north of the Seven Falls clues. From CT Rte. 9, take exit 10 in<br/>
Middletown. Head south on Rte. 154 briefly to the first left onto<br/>
Freeman Rd. About 0.8 miles east on Freeman Rd, park off the road at<br/>
the blue-blazed trail crossing. The Seven Falls hike goes south on the<br/>
blue trail while this search heads north. Please wear a blaze-orange<br/>
vest or hat from November-February, as there is hunting allowed all<br/>
along your path.<br/>
<br/>
Following the blue blazed Mattabesset trail northwards from the parking<br/>
area, walk up and over a small hill and then cross Aircraft Road with<br/>
the blazes. Continue with the blue trail to a signed junction, and head<br/>
straight on the rectangularly blazed Crossover Trail. As with the Seven<br/>
Falls hike, we'll follow the main rectangular blazes out and then take<br/>
the circular blazed Loop Trail back.<br/>
<br/>
On the main trail, hike over several slickrock pathways before dipping<br/>
down a little, spotting a crag on your right. Head northeast through<br/>
mountain laurel shrubbery with a sharp ridge dropping away on your<br/>
right. At the prominent lookout, before the trail gradually drops down<br/>
again, find the Great Wall Letterbox on your left, to the northwest.<br/>
Look for an inconspicuous flat-rocked cairn on the cliff's edge to the<br/>
right (placed to help mark this one particular spot in the woods), and<br/>
a split, chest-high boulder on the left. Pass northwest, to the left of<br/>
the boulder, a few steps into a small clearing where the box is hidden<br/>
on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Now continue about 2 miles along the rectangular blazed main trail, up<br/>
and over the summit of Bear Hill, noting several circular blazed Loop<br/>
Trail crossings along the way. This is handsome, classic Connecticut<br/>
woods walking. Eventually make your way to a downhill through a<br/>
wonderful laurel tunnel, and cross under a first set of power lines. A<br/>
wide slickrock trail brings you under a second power line. From here,<br/>
follow the middle prong of a three-trail fork, which continues the<br/>
rectangular trail blazes. About 30 steps from the fork, find the Bear<br/>
Hill Letterbox on the right, behind a clump of multi-trunked maple.<br/>
<br/>
Now return to the power lines and fork right with the circular blazed<br/>
Loop Trail for your return. Follow this trail as it loops back and<br/>
forth over the main trail, crossing the Bear Hill Summit, and leading<br/>
back to that first intersection and the Aircraft Road crossing before<br/>
your car. A long walk, but worth it.<br/>
