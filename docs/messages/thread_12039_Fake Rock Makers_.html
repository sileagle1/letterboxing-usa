<br/>
I have had some problems finding nice safe places to put my <br/>
letterboxes so I thought why not make fake rocks?<br/>
<br/>
I got some material kind of like papermache' but with a plaster base. <br/>
2 parts dry for one part water got it kind of goopy. I then lavished <br/>
it over three film cannisters and one small tuppertype container. The <br/>
four are drying now. Their openings are on the bottoms and yes, I did <br/>
make sure the lids could come off and go back on. <br/>
<br/>
Next comes the painting. I am spray painting them first with a dark <br/>
granite spackly paint and, after that dries, a clear sealing coat. <br/>
Once they are ready, I will take pics and send them to anyone <br/>
interested. Let me know.<br/>
<br/>
I am also considering boring holes in drift-type wood but might be <br/>
disuaded if the wood might be in a place for a bonfire. We are on the <br/>
beach, afterall.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, anybody else out there making rocks for boxes? What do you <br/>
use? How well have they lasted?<br/>

Why not use the real ones?<br/>
