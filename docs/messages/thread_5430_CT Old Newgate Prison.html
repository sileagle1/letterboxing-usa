                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, we indeed found the four Newgate Prison boxes in our <br/>
attempted wrapup of all the boxes in CT a couple of weeks ago.  <br/>
The stamps from boxes 1 and 3 had somehow gotten reversed <br/>
with the coins stamp that went with the clues for box 3 appearing <br/>
in box 1.  So, as several people ahead of us had suggested for <br/>
the next letterboxers to do, we took the time to put them back in <br/>
the proper order.  It was an interesting series, but we think that <br/>
the paces are of the two steps per pace variety.<br/>

<div>Confirmed that "clothes,compass.food" was still there,.  We found

<div>How strange that the stamps were 
  reversed.  Glad to hear that they are back the way they should be 
  now.  A pace is counted as two steps.  Hope this helps.  By the 
  way, was the silver ink pad in the last box?  One person told me it was 
  missing, but then recently I heard it was still there.  Hope you enjoyed 
  your hike.</div>
