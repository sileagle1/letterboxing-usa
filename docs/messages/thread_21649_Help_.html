<br/>
I need a computer wiz for this one!  I have two problems with getting my mail<br/>
and sending mail out, that I am hoping someone can help direct me how to fix,<br/>
as my mailbox is being inudated with letterboxing mail! *Smiles* <br/>
<br/>
I have two ways to check my mail....I can either use Outlook Express or I can<br/>
use webmail with Microsoft Internet Explorer. On my computer at work,(this is<br/>
not happening on my computer at home) when I am using Outlook Express, I can<br/>
read my emails, but can't reply to anything...I get this error message:<br/>
<br/>
Your server has unexpectedly terminated the connection. Possible causes for this<br/>
include server problems, network problems, or a long period of inactivity.<br/>
Account: 'GypsyPyrates.com', Server: 'gypsypyrates.com', Protocol: SMTP, Port:<br/>
25, Secure(SSL): No, Socket Error: 10053, Error Number: 0x800CCC0F<br/>
My webmaster and server cannot figure out why its doing this, but it has been<br/>
for months, even after running virus scans and checkups, etc.  Anyone have any<br/>
idea how to fix this?  Its very frustrating to read the emails and hit reply<br/>
thinking that they will go through and then they don't.  So instead, I have<br/>
been having to go online to webmail and check my mail and respond through<br/>
there...Which leads me to the second problem:<br/>
<br/>
Since I am now on two letterboxing yahoo groups, I am getting SOOOO much mail in<br/>
my mailbox...which I enjoy mind you....but sometimes its over a 100 messages a<br/>
day.  I know I could go to the websites and read the messages there, but its<br/>
not the same. So what I want to do, is set up "folders" for this email to go<br/>
directly into, then I know its in one folder and I can open at my leisure<br/>
instead of having to sort through all of these emails to get to my regular<br/>
non-letterboxing mail (yes, there is such a thing! *Smiles*) I have heard there<br/>
is a way to do this, but I am unfamilar with this process.  I would like to set<br/>
up one for letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com and one for<br/>
postal_letterboxing@yahoo.com.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone out there know how to do this and can give me step by step<br/>
instructions in an email?  You can write to me personally off list,<br/>
LetterBoxer@GypsyPyrates.com, or if you think this information would help<br/>
others also, then reply to the groups.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I want to know how to do this for Outlook Express as well as Internet<br/>
Explorer.  Anyone got an idea?  THANKS!<br/>

Having had this happen before, I can tell you that either your email <br/>
server and/or your email applications are getting overloaded from <br/>
all the messages you're getting. It's probably both.<br/>
<br/>
Having all those messages will clog up your inbox on the server. <br/>
You're only allowed a limited amount of space. If your IT guys don't <br/>
know that, you need new IT guys. On your own PC, too many messages <br/>
in your inbox will cause the subroutines you don't want to know <br/>
about to choke on themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what to do:<br/>
<br/>
1. Close out all your programs and open only your browser. Access <br/>
the groups of which you're a member and change your Message Delivery <br/>
Preferences to "Special Notices" or "None". If you really don't want <br/>
to have to access the groups to read the messages, then choose one <br/>
of the Digest options.<br/>
<br/>
2. Access your online email and select messages to delete. Make sure <br/>
you empty the trash!<br/>
<br/>
3. Close your browser and open Outlook. Select messages to delete, <br/>
delete them, and empty the trash.<br/>
<br/>
4. Both your online email and Outlook have options for retaining <br/>
messages on the server. You want both to delete messages from the <br/>
server after they've been emptied from the Trash. You also have <br/>
options for how long messages will be retained on the server if they <br/>
are not deleted. One week is enough. Two weeks is more than enough.<br/>
<br/>
This will keep your email flowing nicely!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you Steve, I will look into this and try this...however, my IT and I have<br/>
already been through something like this, and I empty out the cache everyday,<br/>
almost every hour just to keep up!  Perhaps I am not emptying it correctly. <br/>
Anyway, on Outlook Express, I don't have a problem getting the mail, just<br/>
sending it back out, and there is nothing in the inbox or outbox at the times I<br/>
am trying to do this.  Also, this has been going on for MANY months, before I<br/>
joined the news groups that I am now getting lots of mail from.  <br/>
<br/>
In regards to the filters...that is hard to do, because I am the guildmaster of<br/>
a renaissance faire guild, and our email is advertised on our traveling bus as<br/>
well as on our website.  So I am never sure who I am going to get mail from,<br/>
and can't really tell the system that all mails not from so and so are<br/>
considered spam...as I don't know all the "so and so's" that might contact us!<br/>
*Smiles* Everything I know of computers has been self taught with the help of<br/>
people like you responding to my pleas for help, I am still learning, so thanks<br/>
for responding.  I will check these things out and see if it helps to fix<br/>
things.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you're using Outlook Express, you can set up folders for each incoming Yahoo group that you are subscribed to.<br/>
<br/>
Using my system as an example, I've set up a subfolder under my Local Folders called Backup 1. Under Backup 1, I've made subfolders for each type of email I want to separate. I have subfolders called Keep - LB, LB - Boxheads, LB - Newboxers, LB - Southeast, LB - USA and LB - Virtual. <br/>
<br/>
Using my LB - USA an an example:<br/>
<br/>
Under TOOLS, choose MESSAGE RULES and MAIL. This brings up your MESSAGE RULES screen. Click on NEW. I've marked an X next to WHERE THE SUBJECT LINE CONTAINS SPECIFIC WORDS and next to WHERE THE MESSAGE BODY CONTAINS SPECIFIC WORDS. Then place an X (or check mark) next to MOVE IT TO THE SPECIFIC FOLDER.<br/>
<br/>
As you click on these, you'll see the variables showing up on the bottom area of the screen. It defaults to putting an AND in it. Just click on where it says AND and change it to make it an OR. When you click on the variable for the subject line or the message body, it brings up a subscreen where you can add what you want it to look for. For the subject line, add LbNA. For the message body, add http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/<br/>
<br/>
After that, click on the variable for where you want to move the message. It brings up a "file directory" type screen. Choose with "directory" or folder that you want them to go into. <br/>
<br/>
Once these are all done, give it a name at the bottom. I used the same name as what I called my folder. From that point on, any messages that come in with either the subject line showing LbNA or the message body shows http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa, will be filter and moved to your LB - USA folder for easier reading.<br/>
<br/>
You can pretty much use this same method to set up subfolders for any type of mail you have coming in. You can also use this same method to filter/delete junk mail you don't want to see...i.e., anything offensive, etc. I also have made subfolders in order to put messages I'd like to keep or even a folder for "HOLD - READ LATER" or whatever you want to call them. I have subfolders for Tips, Recipes, Disney Stuff, Sims stuff, etc. . . . however you want to organize things. <br/>
