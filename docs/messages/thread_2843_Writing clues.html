                    <div class="plaintext-content">This morning, an 11-year old son-of-friends and I planted my first box in <br/>
the Joyce ("I think that I shall never see, A poem lovely as a tree...") <br/>
Kilmer Memorial Forest.  I never meant to write the clues as a poem, but <br/>
they just seemed to want to be seen that way.  My hobbit genes come out when <br/>
I'm in the woods...<br/>
<br/>
It's not good poetry, by any means, but I hope that the clues are fun and a <br/>
wee mysterious, and that by keeping the compass readings to a minimum and <br/>
the visual clues descriptive, like-minded people will enjoy the walk and <br/>
find the box.<br/>
<br/>
We found the right spot, then made notes on landmarks back to the start, <br/>
making sure to view them from the approach, not the return.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, a retired Naval aviator, then "checked" our clues (pre-poem), <br/>
and whizzed by some of our more creative descriptions, hoping to zero in on <br/>
that crucial compass reading.  In this case, I had to tweak that last <br/>
description, as he zeroed himself right past the target!<br/>
