Placed: October 2003, by Mark &amp; Beth Bendickson <br/>
Nearest City: Portland <br/>
County: Multnomah<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Drive west or East on West Burnside<br/>
to NW Barnes Road, turn north and follow the signs<br/>
up the hill to the Pittock Mansion's main parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
This series lies in an out of the way place.  Public<br/>
access is reduced, though not prohibited.  Still, <br/>
there are private houses around so keep a watchful <br/>
eye out and please take care to rehide the boxes<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES: *all heading degrees calculated at magnetic north.  <br/>
<br/>
Box 1<br/>
<br/>
  Proceed to the SW corner of the parking lot.  A section<br/>
of the Wildwood Trail is very near here.  Step over the <br/>
"chain-gate" between posts-of-blue and walk up the lane.<br/>
Before reaching the top, spy and stand even with the <br/>
"leaning roots".  Pace 16 steps forward at a heading of 320.<br/>
Turn abruptly right and go 5 paces more, then look deep <br/>
into the heart for what you seek.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Box 2<br/>
<br/>
  From box 1, go to the double blue doors, but don't <br/>
stand too close.  Walk at a heading of 70, continuing <br/>
on around the big tank.  Find and stand on the SW corner <br/>
of an old wooden grate.  Count the number of slots, minus <br/>
two, and take large paces this number at 40 degrees.  <br/>
Step around to the back but don't get spooked. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Box 3<br/>
<br/>
  Starting back at the grate, walk 30 paces at a heading<br/>
of 260 to a small side trail.  Walk down this trail to <br/>
its end.  Here, backtrack 11 steps more, then look down<br/>
and locate a small hidden door.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Box 4<br/>
  Return towards the large white tank.  "No swimming please!"<br/>
Take an immediate right turn and continue 32 paces.  Here,<br/>
spot the trail leading into the "Haunted Forest".  Beware<br/>
of an old "ivy gargoyle" that guards this entrance.  To <br/>
find what you seek, reach carefully between the gargoyle <br/>
and a north leaning tree.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Box 5<br/>
  As you enter the Haunted Forest the trail curves right,<br/>
be careful not to trip on the root.  Step over and walk<br/>
4 paces more.  You are now standing in the heart of the<br/>
"Haunted Forest".  Stay alert and listen, for there are<br/>
strange sounds in here.  Ahead in the distance spy what<br/>
mistakenly appears to be a "tree-of-three", and make your<br/>
way to it.<br/>
<br/>
"Yikes What was that sound???"<br/>
<br/>
A flash of something dashes across your trail disappearing<br/>
ahead of you.  <br/>
<br/>
"Oh me-oh-my, is there something up in that tree?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Box 6<br/>
<br/>
  Return back up the trail to the forest heart and stop<br/>
at the two "skinny sentinels".  On your left spot a distant<br/>
"leaning spear".  Go to it crossing through the<br/>
"Land-of-the-Spiders".  From the spear's NNW point, spot<br/>
a cleft in a distant tree at a heading of 270.  Go to<br/>
this place where you will find two sister trees, one<br/>
ivy wrapped and one completely free.  Together they <br/>
hold what you seek.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Box 7<br/>
  Now leave the forest back the way you came in.  At the<br/>
gargoyle, take a sharp right and walk to a large white square.<br/>
Look to your right for a very faint trail.  Walk in and <br/>
step over, turn around and look under, for your terror <br/>
waits down below.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your series is complete -- Happy Halloween!  <br/>
