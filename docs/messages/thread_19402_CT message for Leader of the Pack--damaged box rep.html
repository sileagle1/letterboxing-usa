                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry to stick this on the general list, but I thought I ought to <br/>
report in about the Puzzles Double The Fun box series (CT). I went <br/>
out today to do the series, and got through the first three with no <br/>
problems. The third box, however, had clearly been tampered <br/>
with...the box was sitting out in plain view, was not completely <br/>
shut, had a small amount of water inside, and was missing a couple of <br/>
key pieces to the puzzle inside. The stamp pad was dry, though the <br/>
stamp itself was fine. I stamped in and rehid the box as best I <br/>
could, but without the complete puzzle, the fourth box proved <br/>
impossible to find--hopefully, it's still out there wherever it's <br/>
supposed to be and in good shape.<br/>
Another letterboxer (I believe her name was "mommy of three") had <br/>
stamped in only yesterday, and there was no mention of any problems <br/>
in her entry, so it's possible this happened only in the last day or <br/>
so.<br/>
Anyway, I enjoyed the series as far as I was able to get with <br/>
it...let me know if there's anything I can do to help!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did this series just last evening.  I posted a message to Leader <br/>
of the Pack last night to contact me as I wanted to report the same <br/>
issues/damages with the box as you had mentioned.  I tried to email <br/>
Leader of the Pack thru her website but am not sure if she is <br/>
getting the emails.  I had rehid the third box just as I had found <br/>
it although I did add a rock to sit on top of it.  Box 1 (both the <br/>
box and the clues box) both had water in it.  Box 2 was ok.  Box 3 <br/>
had water in it, part of the clues were missing and the ink pad was <br/>
dry.  Box 4 (yes I found it) also had water in it.  <br/>
<br/>
Another box planted by Leader of the Pack - called "Daybreak" is now <br/>
out in the open.  The tree that it was hidden in has now been cut <br/>
down and is just a stump.  The box is still there but is very <br/>
visible.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows Leader of the Pack it would be appreciated to let <br/>
her know of this. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It sounds like someone (or something--lots of fauna in that area)<br/>
knows where the third box is and is fiddling with it, since there was <br/>
no indication that the third box had EVER been hidden--the box was <br/>
completely out in the open and apparent to anyone walking by. There <br/>
were rocks in the area, though (possibly the same ones you used <br/>
yesterday)--I used them to hide the box just as you did, with some <br/>
sticks and leaves thrown on for good measure (the first and second <br/>
boxes were exactly as you describe them, though--perhaps the <br/>
locations of those are still unknown to whoever's messing with the <br/>
third one). Unfortunately, after what you've told me, I don't hold <br/>
out much hope for the box being safe even with the new concealment.<br/>
<br/>
I second your call--if anyone knows Leader of the Pack, please let <br/>
her know about this problem.<br/>
<br/>
Three cheers for you, by the way, for finding the fourth box without <br/>
the full clue--I was completely flummoxed without it. It was rather <br/>
disappointing, but still a nice afternoon's walk.<br/>
