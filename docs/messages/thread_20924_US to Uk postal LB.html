The Bonny Anne is almost ready to begin her maiden voyage and I still<br/>
need boxers from the UK/Ire/Scot area to send her to.Please sign up<br/>
if you are from these areas I have spent a lot of time and effort (5<br/>
days)on this stamp and i'm sure you all will love it!Email me and I<br/>
will put you on the list.I am leaving this list open to UK/Ire/Scot<br/>
boxers until Jan.1st because the box will be going to US boxers first<br/>
and then to your area so that we may view each others stamps.Also I <br/>
still have 5 spots open to US boxers that would like to recieve the <br/>
precious.<br/>
Thank You and Happy Letterboxing! Kreepy Kelli S.I.C.C.<br/>
