humidity, and ravenous mosquitos this evening to find 4 boxes in the <br/>
Bainbridge area.  <br/>
<br/>
First we found franzsolo's Rest Area and Java (2 stamps - a bonus!).  <br/>
Both dry, in good shape, and wonderful stamps as always.  Only the <br/>
ever-present Wanda from RI fish stamp in the logs ahead of ours.  Is <br/>
there anywhere she hasn't been?  Does she ever sleep?<br/>
<br/>
Then, on to Paint Creek S.P. to ferret out Salamander's Mallard <br/>
Fillmore and Bearfoot In The Park.  Pack Rat was most happy to be <br/>
stamped in as first finder for these.  Both boxes are dry and in good <br/>
shape with really nice hand carved stamps.  The Mallard Fillmore <br/>
stamp is somewhat of an optical illusion - you can turn it ninety <br/>
degrees and it still looks like what it's supposed to only it's <br/>
facing the other way?  How'd they do that??? <br/>
<br/>
These were all our favorite type boxes - short to moderate walks, <br/>
nice stamps, lovely places, and good clues.  Keep up the good work!<br/>
