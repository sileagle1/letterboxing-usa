Tried to post an intro message earlier, but it doesn't look like it went through...so...once again...I just discovered Letterboxing today while surfing the 'net! I'm totally intrigued and can't wait to get started. We are in Johnston County, North Carolina and I wasn't able to find too many boxes on the web site near here. Are there more sources for clues in this area? Anybody have any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Welcome to letterboxing, Shellie.<br/>
<br/>
The overwhelming majority of letterbox clues are posted on the LbNA site. <br/>
There are occasionally clues to be found in other locations, but they're <br/>
generally not listed on the LbNA site for a reason!<br/>
<br/>
But don't despair -- one amazing truth about letterboxing is that "if you <br/>
plant them, they will come." Someone has to introduce Johnston County, <br/>
North Carolina to letterboxing -- and it looks like you're nominated! Once <br/>
you start planting a few letterboxes, you'll be helping the activity to <br/>
grow, and pretty soon other letterboxes will start finding your boxes, and <br/>
then those letterboxers will start planting their own, and pretty soon <br/>
you'll have a thriving community of letterboxers in your own neck of the wood.<br/>
<br/>
I see that there are a couple of letterboxes in Wake County, so you may <br/>
want to take a little road trip to find your first few letterboxes. I'd <br/>
suggest that you try to find a couple before planting your own, just to get <br/>
the hang of how letterboxes are hidden, how they're put together, etc. (You <br/>
can learn lots by checking out the various web sites about letterboxing <br/>
that provide all kinds of tips, but there's nothing like searching for a <br/>
couple to really help you get the hang of it.)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
