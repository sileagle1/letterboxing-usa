                    <div class="plaintext-content">Do any of you Garden-Staters know which, if any, letterboxes are close to Ocean City? Given the driving times peculiar to the coastal regions, it's hard to tell by the clues which are the closest.  Within 1/2 hour would be great, or within an hour (especially South of Ocean City) may work too.  Or if there are any boxes close to the A.C. Expressway or the Parkway South of the expwy, I could look for them on the way home.  Also, does anyone know if Swamp Thing has been replaced? As far as I could tell, that might be the closest one to O.C.  I'll be in O.C. for 4 days with a friend who's never letterboxed.  Doesn't sound real interested, but I may be able to get her intrigued, or at least find some close ones myself.  We'll have bicycles as well as a car. I'm pretty familiar with the beach towns from O.C. South to Cape May, but not the inland ones.  I'd love to stop in Phila. on the way home and look for the new Franklin ones, but don't know if we'll have time.  Thanks, folks!   --lunaryakketyact<br/>
