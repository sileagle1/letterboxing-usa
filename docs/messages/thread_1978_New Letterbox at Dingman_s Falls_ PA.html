<br/>
Dingman's Falls is in the Delaware Water Gap area of the Poconos, and is<br/>
a nice falls that is accessible via a 1/2 mi long handi-cap accessible<br/>
ramp.  It is run by the National Park Service and is open year round<br/>
(though you may need to hike a mile or so in if the access road has not<br/>
been plowed).  There may be a small fee in the summer.  When we were<br/>
there in the winter we ran into cross country skiers and some ice<br/>
climbers!  The road to the falls is a stone throw south along Rt 209<br/>
from Rt 739. <br/>

accessible boxes (bigger orienteering meets offer wheel chair routes). <br/>
Maybe list them under their state but also under a special page listing. I <br/>
imagine a friend or family member would have to come along to "dig" up the <br/>
box and put it back but they'd probably do that anyway...<br/>
