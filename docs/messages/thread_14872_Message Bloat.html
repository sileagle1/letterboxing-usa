I for one don't think we need another group. I'm already a member of two and wouldn't want to keep up with another one as well.  I've been posting my SitRep/Updates/Flippityjibbity/ThingAMaJig/Report's to both lists I am on.  If the national list feels that reports are a waste, I'll stop posting them there.  I try to be interesting and funny with the exploits of the newbie Rayvenhaus's.  Life's to short not to have fun. <br/>
<br/>
But that's just my two cents worth.<br/>

no no no no no no no no no no no no....waaaah! (temper tantrum)<br/>

I love this site just the way it is. I love the chat and the updates and the <br/>
people. I hope that we DON'T start compartmentalizing ourselves...and I really <br/>
don't want to receive TWO letterboxing lists. Sure, I delete a lot of stuff <br/>
that I don't even bother reading, but mostly it's the out of state stuff (and <br/>
if anyone suggests having a different site for each state I will come to your <br/>
house and pinch you). There are threads I read and threads I don't. No one says <br/>
you have to read everything on the list.<br/>
<br/>
And did I thank the webmasters today?  Thank you!!! You are all angels!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If anything, I think having the board split into regions might help <br/>
with the volume of posts. I really enjoy having a Pacific Northwest <br/>
group. It is small enough that the volume of posts is not what it is <br/>
on the National Board. You guys in other states might consider that. <br/>
New England could probably handle a group all to themselves. <br/>
<br/>
For those of us that travel region to region frequently, we could <br/>
check up on that region's board for the latest SitReps. :-)<br/>
<br/>
And you could chat with folks who are primarily in the same area that <br/>
you are...without having to wade through posts about Letterbox XYC in <br/>
Timbuktu (no offense meant to those of you who live in Timbuktu)<br/>
