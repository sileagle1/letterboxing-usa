&gt; Even though the box has a new stamp, I say that because it stays in<br/>
&gt; the same location and retains the same name, it counts as a find only<br/>
&gt; once.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
That's how I'd count it, too.   Or rather, not count it.   Or something.<br/>

&gt; 5 boxes<br/>
&gt; all of which have their own set of clues, and the first four have<br/>
&gt; stamps only, while the fifth has the logbook. One find or five?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
That one could go either way, I guess.   I'd count it as five, though.<br/>

I think if you follow the clues, find the box, and are ready and willing<br/>

thus fulfills the requirement.  But hey, what do I know?  My handle is<br/>
