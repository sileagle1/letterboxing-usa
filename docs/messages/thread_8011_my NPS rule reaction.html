don't post much to the group in terms of comments.  I usually just submit 
clues to boxes I have hidden....some of which are probably on National Park 
property...can't say for sure because I never knew there would be a problem with 
it.  I've hidden quite a few along Blue Ridge Parkway, and a lot of those 
are probably on NP land.  I am deeply saddened by the issues the NPS have 
taken with letterboxing.  The entire concept of hiding letterboxes on Blue 
Ridge Parkway was born of a great sentimental notion.  Someone "rehiding" 
these boxes would only serve to void the sentimentality the box held when 
planted in the first place.</span></div>

is because it isn't understood.  Letterboxing seems to appeal to only a 
minority of people, which serves the sport well.  But, in this instance it 
puts us against the wall.  The NPS is a lot bigger than we are and can make

Yes, but....let me play Devil's advocate. State, county and <br/>
National parks were mostly established for a reason: To <br/>
preserve open space, or green space in or around a city, or an <br/>
endangered or threatened plant/animal/ecosystem. I'm new to <br/>
the sport, and when I was first looking for boxes I found that I <br/>
often didn't need that last clue because I could see a parth <br/>
already established leading to the hiding place. That's not a <br/>
problem in every park, but it could grow to be a serious one in <br/>
more fragile areas, and the folks charged with protecting those <br/>
areas need to make decisions about how much damage a <br/>
particular area can tolerate. I don't think letterboxers will ever be <br/>
on a par with off-road motorized vehicles like dirt bikes and <br/>
snowmobiles, but as our numbers grow (and I hope they do) we <br/>
need to think ahead and eliminate problems before they become <br/>
such. Someone has already suggested some positive steps like <br/>
offering to help clean up litter and such -- introducing ourselves <br/>
to park personnel and asking what we could do as volunteers in <br/>
our local parks -- presenting ourselves as positive forces rather <br/>
than destructive ones. Because once rules are established <br/>
concerning our sport  they will be hard to change, and the bigger <br/>
the government agency the more remote from reality the rules <br/>
may be. And the more mindlessly they will be enforced. If I <br/>
remember right, the Davises in Vermont had some useful <br/>
thoughts on this subject. Maybe they could respond.<br/>
