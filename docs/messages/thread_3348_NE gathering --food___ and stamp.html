   I think the easiest way to do this will be to ask everyone that plans to <br/>
come to the gathering to bring some food item to share. Please email me <br/>
(sdon4373@postoffice.uri.edu) to let me know what you would like to bring. <br/>
This way we don't end up with ten pasta salads! Thanks!!!<br/>
<br/>
Regarding event stamps, RIBNAG will prepare a stamp of the witches of east and <br/>
west. Trish, when will we plant these?<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing from you. <br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Thanks for taking care of the food, Shannon.  If everyone could post <br/>
or email Shannon or I with the number of people expected then we will <br/>
make sure that there are sufficient paper goods, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the event stamp, Wanda and Pete.  I agree.  Why not two?  I <br/>
have to admit that I already had one in mind so I would be happy to <br/>
share the task with Chip Goss.<br/>
<br/>
Carolyn Stearns had asked me if everyone was just coming for the day <br/>
or if people were staying additional days to get more 'boxing in.  I <br/>
believe that she has a commitment on Saturday night and has to leave <br/>
early and was wondering if it would be worth coming back the <br/>
following day.  I thought that I would ask on the message board to <br/>
see anyone planned to stay on.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see many of you in two short weeks!<br/>

Hi Trish and all,<br/>
    Dan and I are planning on coming and camping out on Friday and Saturday<br/>
nights, so we will be around for much of the weekend.  Will let you know<br/>
what we are bringing for food soon.  We are also planning on placing a box<br/>
for the event.<br/>

was pregnant and could not make the trip up.  For the 2nd one, my<br/>
daughter had just come home from the NICU, for the 3rd one - my dad had<br/>
passed away and we were up in Canada.  And now for this 4th one (have<br/>
there been more?), my husband will be away overseas and I'm not so sure<br/>
a drive to RI from NH is one I want to make by myself with a 1.5 year<br/>
old kidlet...After 3+ years of this, I've only met Erik and Susan Davis<br/>
(not that that's a bad thing).<br/>

I think we're destined never to meet any of you.  How sad that fate<br/>
would be.<br/>
