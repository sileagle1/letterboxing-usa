                    <div class="plaintext-content">" Boxing Day " greetings from a Newbie!  My sons have<br/>
just introduced <br/>
me to <br/>
your Sport. I'm hooked in a Big Way!  Tom was the<br/>
first to discover it, <br/>
and <br/>
then he told his brother Dick about it ( Dick likes on<br/>
the west coast, <br/>
which <br/>
is probably good, because he and his brother fight<br/>
about everything ).  <br/>
Now <br/>
its a family affair.  I got a new compass from Dick<br/>
for Christmas, and <br/>
Tom <br/>
made me a letterboxing kit.  What do you keep in your<br/>
kits ??  Now I'm <br/>
ready <br/>
to go out and catch them all (As my grandson Josh<br/>
Noone likes to say <br/>
about <br/>
Pokemon).<br/>
<br/>
There are so many to catch !  How do I decide which<br/>
ones to go after ??  <br/>
I <br/>
get confused by the number of clues.  What I'd like to<br/>
see is a " Top <br/>
Ten <br/>
Page ".  Since its the end of the year, how would<br/>
people feel about <br/>
voting <br/>
for your Favorite Boxes of 2002 ??  It would be much<br/>
more interesting <br/>
to <br/>
fight over than some of the things Tom and Dick have<br/>
told me that <br/>
letterboxers fight about  We could make categories- "<br/>
Best Overall ", " <br/>
Best <br/>
Clue ", " Best Stamp ", " Best Location ", " Best<br/>
Hitchhiker ", " Best <br/>
Hidden ", and since some people here seem to be in a<br/>
compitition to <br/>
create <br/>
the Crappiest Stamp , " Crappiest Stamp " .  Dick (<br/>
He's a computer wiz <br/>
kid <br/>
out in WA ) showed me that there is a way that you can<br/>
set up things to <br/>
vote <br/>
on.  People could nomminate their favorites for the<br/>
next couple of <br/>
weeks, <br/>
and then we could all vote!  I love democracy!  Then,<br/>
a top ten list <br/>
for <br/>
each of the categories could be posted on the LBNA<br/>
sight.  This would <br/>
be <br/>
Very Helpful to Newbies like me who are wondering<br/>
which boxes are " Not <br/>
To <br/>
BE Missed ".  It would be easy to evaluate the clues,<br/>
because they're <br/>
all on <br/>
the sight.  Maybe it could be made easy by making a<br/>
page that listed <br/>
and <br/>
linked to the nomminated boxes (What does that mean? <br/>
Dick told me to <br/>
say <br/>
it) .  Maybe the Nominated Stamps ( both good and<br/>
crappy ) could be <br/>
posted <br/>
by their Owners so that we can see them before voting.<br/>
 Pictures of <br/>
locations could even be posted if we want to get fancy<br/>
!  Think of the <br/>
fun <br/>
this will be in January !  It could ever turn out to<br/>
be an annual post <br/>
Boxing Day event !<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing and Happy New Year !  I look forward to<br/>
meeting you all on <br/>
the <br/>
trail.<br/>

Dickie, show some respect for your mother.  There is nothing I can do <br/>
about the Alzheimer's. I'm still at my sister's in Sarasota.  The RV <br/>
is running fine.  I'll putter around here for a couple months and <br/>
then set out in your direction, letterboxing across America.  I hear <br/>
that Ryan is a hottie !  Do you think I can meet him when I get to <br/>
Washington ??<br/>
<br/>
love, Mom <br/>
