"pay us something" was not my response to the EMS<br/>
representative.  (I have not responded to them and I<br/>
don't intend to.) It was my way of stressing the fact <br/>
that any money that may be offered on behalf of what<br/>
is done with this site I consider to be offered to<br/>
us corporately.  But the truth is I don't want to get<br/>
into that at all and I hope we don't get that. Let's<br/>
keep it simple and low profile.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this makes it more clear.  That statement was a <br/>
little confusing I know.<br/>
