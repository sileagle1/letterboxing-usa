&gt;the new one? Funhog This will probably a duplicate answer since yahoo commited my first one to the ether... We will be maintaining both websites for a period of time during the conversion.  The webmasters will transfer over all the boxes on the current site to the new one.  We are encouraging all those with clues to transfer their boxes over to the new site so that they will own the clues and don't have to "claim" them after conversion.  This will enable you to list and maintain your own clues on the LbNA website without going through the webmasters.  Anyone who chooses not to do so or is no longer active in letterboxing will have theirs done automatically.  Boxers with clues on their own websites will notice that they can still link to their own webpage and maintain creative control that way.  New boxes placed during the conversion will be listed on both sites. Trish<br/>
