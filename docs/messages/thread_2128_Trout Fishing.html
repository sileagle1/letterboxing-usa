in America.  The lake was rising steadily yesterday and I fear it <br/>
will quickly be inundated if we get more rain this weekend. If it <br/>
looks threatened I will pull it for a couple days until the water <br/>
recedes on second thought I could just move it to join Watermelon <br/>
sugar  then move it back. The lake at Mansfield Hollow is a flood <br/>
control facility and is occasionaly very high, enough to close off <br/>
the road for days at a time.  You will see the yellow gates for such <br/>
purpose when you visit the area. I don't mind tending the box at all <br/>
as I work near there and keep an eye on the rising water on my daily <br/>
commute.  I'll let you all know what we find.    Carol - in haven't <br/>
we had enough wet?<br/>
