Erik Davis I decided to include a trip to Bristol this weekend while <br/>
visiting my sister in VT.  Hope everyone finds the opportunity to <br/>
come to the birthplace of North America letterboxing. I found myself <br/>
sitting by the river, enjoying the solitude and contemplating how <br/>
much my life has changed since I started letterboxing. A worthwhile <br/>
visit on many levels. <br/>
While in VT I also visited the Man in Stone letterbox and West <br/>
Arlington letterbox - both in good shape and both near nice water <br/>
attractions.<br/>

  After a year off of letterboxing, because of work schedules,  the Trailin' Taylors are finally back.  We're planning on camping in Winhall Brook, VT next week, and were wondering about any letterboxes we should not miss.  We'll be near Londonderry and West Townshend, VT.<br/>
  If anyone has any suggestion please email me at laura9193@yahoo.com.<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you,<br/>
<br/>
  Mama Bear of the Trailin' Taylors<br/>
