                    <div class="plaintext-content">I actually heard of geocaching (btw it is www.geocaching.com if you are interested) long before I heard of letterboxing.  I consider myself a letterboxer but have found a couple caches and use the same trail name.  I dated a guy for awhile that was heavy into geocaching, and I have learned a bit about GPS when selling them and via my father as well.  The ex-boyfriend also looked for Benchmarks, which are fascinating.  I have found a few of those by chance now that I know what they are! :)<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of the "treasure hunt" and have seen themed items and interesting trinkets as well as "junk" in caches.  It is a very fast-growing sport, and perhaps it is more appealing to the masses because of the gadget factor.  I cannot honestly say it is any different in terms of its aim or its problems.  Geocachers (hopefully!) subscribe to similar rules of respect and law, and practice "Cache In, Trash Out" gentleness witht he environment.  Even the toughest of puzzles or simplest directions can still leave you empty-handed.  Waypoints or not, you still have the possibility that boxes or caches are lost, missing, damaged, stolen, vandalized, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Even though there are FAR more caches than letterboxes in my area (25ish LB's in the entire state of Iowa versus almost a THOUSAND caches!), I choose to remain primarily a letterboxer.  I love the "naturalness" in using the area's contours, vegetation, and landmarks with a compass and my stride (paces, steps) to locate what we are borrowing for our own pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong:  GPS can be quite handy devices, especially useful when hiking, fishing, driving, etc.  I just appreciate the simplicity of the compass which relies upon the earth, not batteries.  No amount of precision in tools can account for problems in clues, location, or outside factors.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel similarly in many of my other hobbies and interests - fancy gadgets, computers are merly tools that can never replace the old school methods! :D<br/>

I'm a letterboxer and an avid GPS user.  I use the GPS as a mapping <br/>
tool with the Nordic Ski Patrol.  However, I prefer letterboxing as <br/>
a pastime.  Actually, within letterboxing I prefer the challenge of <br/>
mystery boxes to regular ones.  <br/>
<br/>
You're right about the need to know how to use a compass.  You <br/>
should always know where you are and be prepared to navigate without <br/>
GPS.<br/>
