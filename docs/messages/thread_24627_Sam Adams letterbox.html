<br/>
The boxer who placed this letterbox is the well-known Silver Eagle who lives in TX by the way. Many of us place boxes while on vacation or traveling for work. There isn't a guarantee that evey box you seek will be there. Hope you enjoyed the sights, which for some, is reward enough. The box is considered a bonus.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the hunt,<br/>

The response you received was a personal reply back from your report <br/>
post that you sent to the planter. Posting of someone's personal <br/>
replys isn't very good form. You didn't just hit the reply button, <br/>
you had to copy and paste their response onto your public posting.<br/>
While there was nothing troubling in the private response, you action <br/>
was troubling. If you had a problem with the response you received <br/>
why not take it up with the writer.<br/>
<br/>
Having received similar messages from finders unable to locate our <br/>
(Don &amp; Gwen) letterboxes, I thought that it was not written with <br/>
anything other than "Sorry", and "Thank you for sending it".<br/>
Many times planters receive notices that their letterbox is gone, <br/>
when in fact the finder just couldn't figure out clues, or followed <br/>
clues properly.<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand your "What can we do?" question. You wrote, you <br/>
received an answer, and apparantly the clues were changed.<br/>

I can see why the original poster thought that he hadn't, since he didn't mention that he would in his reply. Although there was a bit of a misunderstanding it actually shows how finders and hiders can work together to maintain letterboxes. Even if someone plants while on vacation they can still update their clues with information they receive from finders. Kudos Donna for contacting the planter and kudos to Silver Eagle for updating the status.<br/>
