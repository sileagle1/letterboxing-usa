                    <html><body>here are clues for a new box i placed in Florida while on vacation in June.  
<br/>i have actually lost the clues i wrote out at the time of the hike but have a 
<br/>pretty good idea about where the box is. if someone goes to find it please 
<br/>write to me and let me know how the directions worked i would appreciate 
<br/>that. thanks AmyB p2 f12
<br/>
<br/>Question: I took a group hiking at sleeping giant state park where we looked 
<br/>for the box up at the tower but had no luck. We did not have a compass -- is 
<br/>that really necessary to find the box? please email me if you have found the 
<br/>box before with or without a compass.
<br/>
<br/>Hillsborough River State Park
<br/>
<br/>Florida Christmas Box #2
<br/>
<br/>Easy walking
<br/>
<br/>2 hours if looking for both boxes (there was one there already)
<br/>
<br/>the park is located in Thonotassa, FL and is one of the most beautiful parks 
<br/>i have ever been to. my niece and i saw two alligators swimming in the river 
<br/>there.   there are also a lot of things to do here. there is a really nice 
<br/>pool if you want to take a swim after the hike.  when you get to the park 
<br/>there is a fee to enter about $3 i believe.  start the trail by looking for 
<br/>the first letterbox hidden there.  after finding the first box turn around 
<br/>and head back over the bridge. at the bottom of the bridge turn right and 
<br/>continue along the trail following the river.  the trail will come out to a 
<br/>picnic grove area continue walking past until you reach another bridge.  go 
<br/>over this bridge and walk into the wood.  the sandy trail forks off -- take 
<br/>the left fork.  after walking a few minutes you will see the trail splits 
<br/>again.  there is a sign where you can take the trail to the left or go 
<br/>straight.  take the left (i believe it is the florida trail - but im not 
<br/>sure)  as you walk along this trail soon you will see a small path that leads 
<br/>off  the trail on the left side.  walk off the trail onto this path.  at the 
<br/>top of the path look left you will see a large tree up on a small hill (i 
<br/>believe an oak tree -dont really remember)  at the base of this tree is the 
<br/>2nd Florida Christmas Box. Good Luck. Please email me whoever finds the box 
<br/>first! abandy420@aol.com </body></html>
