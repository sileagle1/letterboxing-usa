School Street<br/>
Hillsboro, New Hampshire<br/>
planted on 9-20-02 by ARK and CERK.<br/>
architechturally beautiful, easy and quick<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  A new bypass has curled around Hillsboro, and my Yahoo <br/>
map feature has not caught up.  That said, sorry for the somewhat<br/>
lame directions.  Find your way to downtown Hillsboro.  At the traffic <br/>
light where route 149 turns toward Deering, you want to head in the <br/>
opposite direction, northwest up School Street.  The library will soon <br/>
be on your right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to Hillsboro, New Hampshire, birthplace of Franklin Pierce, <br/>
and home of Governor John Smith.  The Fuller Public Library was <br/>
once the Governor's Mansion. Currently the building houses not only <br/>
the library, but also the town offices.  To see a bit more of the <br/>
building, we hope you will look around and discover all the adornment <br/>
within, or even ask the librarians if you might be able to see <br/>
upstairs (there is a ballroom and billiard room as well as a<br/>
fantastic <br/>
DAR museum).<br/>
<br/>
Library hours are: <br/>
Monday and Friday  Noon to 5:00 p.m.<br/>
Tuesday and Thursday  9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.<br/>
Saturday    9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
Walk up the granite stairs and across the broad front porch which <br/>
wraps around the facade. Upon entering the heavy carved doors, notice <br/>
the mosaics on the floor.  Then allow your eyes to scan the wood <br/>
carving at the top of all the pillars and moldings in the rooms. <br/>
Each is different though they appear to all work well together.  Make <br/>
an immediate right and walk along the front of the non-fiction<br/>
stacks. <br/>
The umbrella stand at the far end of the fireplace is a true work of <br/>
art, and one of my favorite pieces of wood carving.  Continue on and <br/>
pay attention to the curved glass windows in the periodical section.  <br/>
When you arrive at the open doorway, look up to the ceiling and find <br/>
the room with the cherubs and hunting scene painted above.  Within <br/>
that room hangs a Bicentennial Quilt over the mantle.  To the left of<br/>
the quilt is a diagram explaining each of the squares.  Identify the <br/>
Smith Memorial Congregational Church square, and reach under the<br/>
quilt (handling it as little as possible, please) to find the letter <br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the librarians are aware of the box and its location.  If you <br/>
find that it has been tampered with, or is missing an element, please <br/>
either notify me at ahandabsmom@hotmail.com or let one of the <br/>
librarian's know and they will contact me.  We hope you enjoy our <br/>
Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Credit for creating this box and the stamps therein go to Butterbaby <br/>
ARK of Hillsboro, NH and rtrw of Hartford,CT.  Continuing up School <br/>
Street several miles will bring you to the Town Pound Letterbox.<br/>
