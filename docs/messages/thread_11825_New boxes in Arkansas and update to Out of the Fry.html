                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry it took so long to get these posted!  Sarah was out in <br/>
Arkansas on a business trip not too long ago and planted 4 boxes.  <br/>
The clues for three of them can be found at:<br/>
<br/>
http://wildwinds.tripod.com/adg2.html#trio<br/>
<br/>
Clues for the fourth box will be available shortly.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I changed the clues to the Out of the Frying Pan and Into the <br/>
Fire series.  They can still be located at the same place on our <br/>
website but they now include several hints.  I am finding out that I <br/>
need an editor because what I think is pretty straight forward turns <br/>
out to be pretty vague to just about everyone else!  <br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all at the Postal Museum this weekend!<br/>
