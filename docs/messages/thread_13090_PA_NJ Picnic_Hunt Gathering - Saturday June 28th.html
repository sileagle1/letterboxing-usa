                    <div class="plaintext-content">One month to go! Plan on arriving around 11 am. A full kettle of <br/>
veggie chili will be waiting for you. For those not familiar with <br/>
the area, the Moravian Pottery &amp; Tile Works is located on Route 313<br/>
(Swamp Road), Doylestown, Pa. (on the right heading southeast from <br/>
the 611 by-pass). Plenty of parking. We will be in the picnic area in <br/>
back of the Pottery Works. E-mail Ed if you need additional <br/>
directions. Look for the LbNA sign.<br/>
<br/>
A new stamp has been carved for the event, and new box planted on the <br/>
site (this makes three). Bring your own goodies and drinks. (sorry! <br/>
no alcohol - county park rule).<br/>
<br/>
We have ordered sunshine for the event! :o)<br/>
<br/>
It would he helpful to hear from those who plan to attend so enough <br/>
space can be staked out. It's first come/first served at this site; <br/>
so someone will be there early to lay a claim.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: If it's raining buckets, there is some limited shelter by the <br/>
Pottery Works; however bring your umbrellas and ponchos anyway.)<br/>
