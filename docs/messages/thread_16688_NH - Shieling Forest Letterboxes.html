Mark Pepe - it looks like the "white pearl" that's referred to in <br/>
the clues for Shieling Forest box #1 was obstructed by a fallen <br/>
birch tree.  My husband moved the logs aside and so now the pearl <br/>
can be readily seen.  The last person logged in the book in mid-<br/>
October of this year.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Cinco d'Emma Maija box - that's still intact as well and <br/>
the last person logged in September, iirc (but it could have been <br/>
October as well).  I'm going to flesh out the clues a little more <br/>
today so it's not so cryptic.  I want people who go looking for my <br/>
boxes to be able to find them, but I want to give them a bit of a <br/>
challenge at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
I have plans for one more Shieling Forest box, but we probably won't <br/>
get to it until the spring.<br/>
<br/>
Jay - thanks for transferring the boxes over to me on the big <br/>
letterboxing site.<br/>
