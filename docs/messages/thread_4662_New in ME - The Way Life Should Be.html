New letterbox on Streaked Mountain in Paris/Hebron Maine.
</p><p>This is one of my favorite places, as I think it shows off the Maine
mountains so well with a minimal effort - it's a short hike of only 1.5
miles round trip with a vertical gain of about 750 ft. to an elevation
of 1647 ft.  About half way up, the woods give way to open granite,
offering panoramic views of farms and hills. This area was first settled
in the 1730s by the English ancestors of yours truly. Unfortunately now
there are several microwave towers (Mainers like their 79 TV channels and
cell phones) and the old fire lookout tower is closed off, but don't let
it put you out.   Be sure to pack a jacket even on hot summer
days. There always seems to be at least a cool breeze, more often a stiff
cold wind, at the top, and shivering may smudge your stamping.
</p><p>While placing this letterbox, we discovered another! I picked out a
rock under the stump's twisted roots, and found a film canister. In the
canister was a note saying: "We were here 6/14/91 Ray, Nate, Kyle &amp;
Laura." Pretty cool, eh? Just like on old Dartmoor!
</p><p>Enjoy,

<br/><b>Paris/Hebron Maine</b>
</p><p><b>A beautiful hike through dense conifers and across bare granite up
Streaked (thats two distinct syllables: Streak-ed) Mountain, on the Paris/
Hebron/Buckfield town lines.</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>Distance: 1.5 miles</b>
<br/><b>Time: 1-2 hours depending on conditions</b>
<br/><b>Difficulty: I would say moderateits a short and steep walk up,
but no scrambles.</b>
<br/><b>Lower part tends to be muddy when wet and upper part icy when cold.</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>Directions: From the Junction of Routes 26 &amp; 117 (Market Square)
in South Paris, Maine, follow Rt. 117 towards Buckfield. A few miles up
the road you will see Streaked Mountain (with its unfortunate communications
debris) looming ahead. Take a right onto Streaked Mountain Road. Just after
the cemetery on the left, park roadside left side of street and find the
trailhead just past the stream.</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>At the true summit, find the date 1770 carved in the stone. Standing
on the date, look 298 degrees to a small group of evergreens. Under these
trees is a twisted old stump. The Way Life Should Be is under the roots
of the stump.</b></p></body></html>
