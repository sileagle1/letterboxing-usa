temporarily down. Sorry, we're working on it!<br/>
<br/>
There is worse news for the few of us lazy folks who kept clues (or <br/>
other web content) on the free America Online service. I didn't realize <br/>
it, but they've been planning for a month to drop the service <br/>
permanently. Eeek! All the aol-based clues are gone forever. Luckily <br/>
for us we have backups. If you need any Drew Family clues in the next <br/>
few days, please use the wayback machine to drudge them up.<br/>
