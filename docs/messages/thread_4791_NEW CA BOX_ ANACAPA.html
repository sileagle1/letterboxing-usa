<div>Ron  Don't expect this box to remain long .The 
NPS is removing boxes as soon as they find them on our web site. The box at 
Joshua Tree is gone. The only way a box might survive is by utilizing 
mystery clues or by cloaking its title or where it is located .By listing the 
box at Anacapa it will be only a matter of time until it is discovered by NPS. 
My guess is that when it hits "Whats New" that is when it will be in jeopardy.

I bet if you hide it in a place so remote and difficult to get to, <br/>
they won't bother to pull it.  =)  For instance, if someone hid a box <br/>
at the top of Mount Everest, what are the chances someone will go up <br/>
there to retrieve it?  Exactly!  =)  (It's an extreme example, but <br/>
I'm pretty confident my Nesmith Point box in the gorge won't be <br/>
walking away anytime soon!  Torturous, freakin' hike that it is.  <br/>
*smile*)<br/>
<br/>
In related news, I've hidden three boxes at the John Day Fossil Beds <br/>
National Monument close to a year ago.  It's not a National Park, but <br/>
I think they're run by the same people, and all the boxes are alive <br/>
and well the last I've heard.  <br/>
<br/>
So it could also be a regional thing where only some parks are <br/>
pulling them.  I've done volunteer work at the Channel Islands, <br/>
Sequoias, and Yosemite National Parks, and I know darn well they <br/>
don't talk with each other a whole lot.  (As an aside: The smaller <br/>
and less visited the park is, the less red tape there is to cut <br/>
through.)<br/>

Actually, it would be rather hypocritical of the NPS to remove it, <br/>
considering all the JUNK they have laying around their buildings on <br/>
the island. If they do decide to go get it, their excuse will have to <br/>
be something like, "we have far too much time on our hands, so we <br/>
decided to remove your box today".<br/>
If some NPS bureaucrat is actually monitoring LbNA &amp; sending people <br/>
out to remove boxes, then they ought to post a note to this list <br/>
explaining their actions.  We all know that this hobby has virtually <br/>
no negative impact on the parks, &amp; it's actually a healthy, positive <br/>
activity which PROMOTES enjoyment of the outdoors.<br/>
I'm a nature photographer, &amp; a few years ago the NPS tried to place <br/>
absurd regulations on "professional" photographers visiting the <br/>
parks.  Photographers stood their ground, &amp; eventually the park <br/>
service backed off.  Hopefully letterboxers won't be subjected to <br/>
that same sort of nonsense from our government!<br/>
Thanks for the heads-up, Don.<br/>
