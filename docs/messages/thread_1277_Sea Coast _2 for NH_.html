                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's a couple of letterboxes we placed on our recent trip to the <br/>
New Hampshire coast:<br/>
<br/>
Sea Coast<br/>
Location: Odiorne Point State Park in Rye, New Hampshire. Seasonal <br/>
fees: sorry, no dogs allowed. This little slice of the mountainous <br/>
Granite State doesn't know if it's Massachusetts or Maine, and is <br/>
insistently marketed as the "Sea Coast," as though saying it twice <br/>
reinforces that it is indeed New Hampshire. It's beautiful, but we <br/>
wish it was a little more thoughtfully developed.<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: easy 2 miles with one steep and overgrown scramble. One <br/>
or two hours over a counterclockwise shoreside loop.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: On NH Rte. 1A just outside Portsmouth. Park at the main <br/>
state park entrance by the Science Center.<br/>
<br/>
Between the parking lot and the Science Center, climb the stairs over <br/>
the Battery and follow the trail northwards down, across the road, <br/>
and into the woods. The trail follows beautifully northwest along the <br/>
coastline. Stick with the wide main path when it curves left a <br/>
little, away from shore. At an amazing row of sugar maples, fork <br/>
right to a large bunker. Exploring this relic, climb to the top for <br/>
views, then turn north again on the path along the "hill." Pass a <br/>
smaller, house-like concrete gun emplacement and a bit farther along, <br/>
on your left/northwest, find a concrete pier with a sealed steel vent <br/>
shaft. The Rye Beach Letterbox is hidden behind.<br/>
A short way further is a second, identical vent, but not well-sealed, <br/>
and a few yards farther is an open grassy area with views just right <br/>
for stamping in. Please replace the letterbox carefuly in this <br/>
popular spot as the local party crowd are likely to use it for <br/>
kindling if they stumble upon it.<br/>
Now you can either turn back, or continue on for some lovely flat <br/>
hiking. If you continue north and downhill you'll find a sandy point, <br/>
rocky shore, a wonderful jetty, more bunkers, and a boat ramp before <br/>
turning south back to the Science Center on the paved roadside bike <br/>
trail.<br/>
Back at the beginning, continue east past the parking lot to the <br/>
picnic area on the point. Follow the path to several ring-shaped gun <br/>
sites in line, which point at an overgrown, shoreside, curved stone <br/>
bench. The Odiorne Point Letterbox is under a big square flat rock on <br/>
your right as you walk up, at the benches' western end.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you get a chance to stamp in to these boxes!<br/>
