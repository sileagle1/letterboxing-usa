Muskegon Beach Box in Muskegon, MI (Arbo) via e-mail and posts to <br/>
this list have proven unsuccessful.  This box is in need of <br/>
maintenance, specifically the stamp has been missing for quite some <br/>
time.  It is in a great location near Lake Michigan and I would like <br/>
to see it back in service by spring.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore I am trying this one last time to make contact with the <br/>
owner before I adopt the box and give it a new stamp.  Arbo, if you <br/>
are reading this and are still involved in letterboxing, please <br/>
contact me offlist and I will be happy to help you get the box fixed <br/>
up as it is only a few minutes from my house.  Thanks!<br/>
