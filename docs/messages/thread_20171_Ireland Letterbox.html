My sister and Brother in law live in Athy, Ireland, here now until <br/>
Oct visiting, they may not mind caring for it.  they're actually <br/>
letterboxing later this week on the Cape.. i printed up the clues for <br/>
them!  If they get hooked, I was thinking of asking her to plant one <br/>
for me. <br/>
