With Christmas being one of our favorite times of the year, we are excited to celebrate with whomever wants to come out and play! We will start the day by meeting at the public parking area behind Main Street at E. Moore Avenue and S. Church Street at Mooresville, NC. From there we will split up into teams for a letterboxing race around downtown Mooresville. <br/>
<br/>
Then we will meet for lunch (location TBA when we get a bit of an head count), followed by other activities games, giveaways, exchanges, and area boxing for those who want to do more hunting. More details to follow, but we wanted to get the event posted now for people to have notice.<br/>
<br/>
*We are looking for people to donated stamps with the theme loosely being Christmas trees. Loosely meaning that it can be a Christmas tree or something in the shape of a Christmas tree or...be creative! Please contact us if you would like to contribute a stamp or a letterbox. Thank you, thank you bunches!<br/>
