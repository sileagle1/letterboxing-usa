We all, as a group, agree to report or remove boxes on NPS land that<br/>

<br/>
Yes, the idea of removing boxes was a joke.  I wasn't a participant in<br/>
that part of the thread (I tend to bail as soon as I realize that it's<br/>
a troll), but it was so outrageous a suggestion, I was laughing like<br/>
crazy here.  But, I'm active in the rubber stamping and art journaling<br/>
communities (I run two very large lists) so I'm accustomed to jokes<br/>
about cute stamps.<br/>
<br/>
And, I agree with Joy about swapping out stamps.  I carve my own<br/>
stamps and while I'm sad when boxes vanish, I knew that it was a risk<br/>
when I planted them.  I also tend to figure that a high-risk box<br/>
should include a stamp that I won't sob for hours about if it goes<br/>
missing.  I keep my original artwork for each stamp, and--if the stamp<br/>
or box goes missing--I often recarve &amp; replace.  (Now that I live in<br/>
Texas, it's not so easy to replace boxes in New England, though.)<br/>
<br/>
But honestly, I've had Official Park Staff be so encouraging and<br/>
helpful, they've sometimes let me put a letterbox IN their visitors'<br/>
center.  In fact, a State Park in Washington was very enthusiastic<br/>
about this, because it gave them a chance to give each letterboxer a<br/>
sheet that advised them of the park's rules.  And, their head ranger<br/>
went on the trail with me to visually check where each box was, to be<br/>
sure that I was planting in an area that wasn't at risk for<br/>
significant environmental damage.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I run or help moderate several lists.  Trolls don't just hit one<br/>
list.  If you see a troll on one list, there's a good likelihood that<br/>
he or she will turn up on others--or try to, anyway--and be playing<br/>
similar games.  That was the case this past week, not just here and on<br/>
the geocaching list.<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>
