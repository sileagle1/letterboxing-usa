<br/>
I received an email from Turtle McQ who saw we were planning to <br/>
attend the ME gathering later this month. She asked if we made it up <br/>
to Rockport before or after the gathering, would we be able to <br/>
replace her tupperware container at Bull Frog Box, or drop it into a <br/>
new zip lock bag as a favor. Apparently, she must have received an <br/>
email that water was leaking through a hole in the top of the <br/>
tupperware container.<br/>
<br/>
That got me to thinking - could we use a resource where all <br/>
letterboxers who have a few long distance boxes that might need some <br/>
attention could email and ask for help from the boxing community?<br/>
<br/>
Well . . . <br/>

Ta da - visit our new Box Maintenance Page, check out to see if a box <br/>
is nearby that need some help and give a hand to a brother or sister <br/>
letterboxer. If you too have a box in need of some help, email me <br/>
from the link on that page.<br/>
<br/>
And, as always . . .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there and box!!!<br/>

What a neat idea!  Thanks!  You can be sure I will check before my travels<br/>
to see if I can do a bit of foster-care for anyone....<br/>
