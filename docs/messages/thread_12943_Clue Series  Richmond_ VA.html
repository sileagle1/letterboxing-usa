set in, but today we weren't so lucky.  Despite waking up to heavy <br/>
rain we decided not to spend another day indoors rather than getting <br/>
wet and we went back to Richmond in search of the Rooms.  We have now <br/>
become pros at keeping logbooks dry while stamping in.<br/>
<br/>
Found all however the Dining room was floating in a huge pool of <br/>
water in it's hiding spot.  It already had a bit of water damage so <br/>
we piled up rocks/bricks where it should be and placed the box on top <br/>
of them.  You can't see the box so you'll have to reach on top of the <br/>
stones to get to it, but it's still exactly where it's meant to be..<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately we couldnt get down to the weapons today as well, but <br/>
soon!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a fun day out!  <br/>
