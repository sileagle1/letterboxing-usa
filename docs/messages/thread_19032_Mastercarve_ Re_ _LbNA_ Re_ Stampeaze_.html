 Not at the smaller Joann stores, but the big superstores do carry it.  They <br/>
also carry the Mastercarve carving tools.  My store puts these items in the <br/>
rubber stamping aisles, usually near the embossing powders, heat guns, powdered <br/>
pigments, and so forth.  The 2.5" x 5" x .75" block of Mastercarve is $4.99 <br/>
regular price.  The UPC code is 0 3190193615 0.  The Joann store code listed on <br/>
one of my store receipts is 6597363.<br/>
<br/>
Join the Joann mailing list, and you'll get sale flyers every two weeks or <br/>
so.  They almost always have a 40% off one regular price item coupon in the <br/>
flyers.  Sometimes the coupon is worth 50% off.  I use my coupons to buy it.  On <br/>
occasion, our local Sunday paper will have a Joann sale circular with a coupon <br/>
in it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

&gt; I am personally a very big fan of Mastercarve.  You can get it in <br/>
&gt; several sizes and it is a bit more expensive, but I think that for <br/>
&gt; the detail it allows you it is well worth the price.  Most the time <br/>
&gt; people only find Mastercarve in the really thick form, but they have <br/>
&gt; a thin form too which is just a tad bit thicker than PZ Cut – but <br/>
&gt; quite a bit more expensive.  I get a 4x4 sheet for about $2.50 when <br/>
&gt; I buy it in bulk. (A tip I got from Funhog – Thanks Funhog!!)  There <br/>
&gt; is also a website where you can join their VIP list for $25 for a <br/>
&gt; year and get a 30% discount off the regular price, making it just <br/>
&gt; $1.82 a block for the 4x4 ½ thick.  I have also used the Dick Blick <br/>
&gt; EZ Cut that you asked about and found that it was not as easy to <br/>
&gt; carve for fine detail but worked good for things that didn't require <br/>
&gt; fine lines and tiny carve out areas. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The website I mentioned earlier for the Mastercarve is located at<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://www.misterart.com/store/view.cfm?<br/>
&gt; group_id=5908602&amp;store=001&amp;AID=10273655&amp;PID=1117139&amp;afsrc=1<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They also have the Mastercarve carving tools, which I have found to <br/>
&gt; be much easier to handle than the speedball handle ones for detailed <br/>
&gt; design.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope this answers your questions, if not just holler again!<br/>
