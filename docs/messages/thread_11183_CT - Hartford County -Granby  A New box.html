<br/>
Planted by Bookworm and rtrw sometime in the early winter of 2002<br/>
It should be easy to find<br/>
<br/>
After finding the Honey Bucket, continue following the directions<br/>
back place you began on the purple trail.  <br/>
A while after the junction with the light blue trail you will find <br/>
yourself near a very skinny tree, blazed with the lovely purple, on <br/>
the right side of the trail.  From this pathetic little tree, count 3 <br/>
more purple blazes.  After the 3rd blazed tree you will see a double <br/>
trunked deciduous tree with a log at its foot.  <br/>
Be careful.  The Lion is waiting to ambush you there.  Subdue the<br/>
lion by stamping into the log book, and continue on your merry way.  <br/>
Thanks to the Grandbees for bringing us to this wonderful game refuge <br/>
with room for so many boxes.<br/>
