<div>Wow, this is real late but I had an error drawn to my 
attention from my previous posting of the hike coming up on SUNDAY the 11th of 
March NOT saturday the 11th. I wholeheartedly apologize for clarifying so late 
but we will be there on Sunday at the Lanter Hill parking pull off (if there is 
one with all this snow). If you have snowshoes, bring em as they will only 
benefit you. It is unclear as to whether we will traipse all the way out to the 
Little Dam boxes as it is a good distance without the snowshoes. I am currently 
thinking of placing a group box on or near Lantern Hill at the hike that is 
heavily laden with orienteering. We will however find the two boxes on Lantern 
Hill and possibly the new Panic if anyone is brave enough to to up the 
'alternate' route with all the ice and snow. EXTREME CAUTION recommended!! It's 
a long way down. But 10 am Sunday the 11th. This is will be a joint venture with 
the Connecticut Forest and Park Association so there may be a nice little group 
showing. Hope to see you there, and once again, sorry for any 
confusion.</div>
