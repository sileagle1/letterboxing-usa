                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday JugglerMouse, Ash Raven, and I went out to Los Osos Oaks to <br/>
look for a new box placed by The Three Furies. The directions are <br/>
given from Ryan's Butterfly Box in the Los Osos Oaks series. We found <br/>
the Crone Tree box, as advertised.<br/>
<br/>
We went back to the Butterfly Tree box location. We have been there <br/>
quite a few times. The series is a good introduction for new <br/>
letterboxers. The box and stamp are very seriously missing. Not a <br/>
matter of "we could not find it." Heck, we had found it several <br/>
times! It is gone.<br/>
<br/>
I have the logbook from the Oak Tree box (stamp missing) and will <br/>
give or mail it to Ryan whenever he would like. The box is chewed up <br/>
very heavily. Most have been one of us on Atkins. Grrrrr. <br/>
<br/>
I am now investing in short, wide PVC pipe male threaded on both ends <br/>
and a screw on cap for both ends. It may not stop wolverines or <br/>
badgers but it might slowdown a squirrel (or a cheese racing mouse).<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing you down in San Luis Obispo, CA on October <br/>
4th. Once is not enough for events! I can see how we will start <br/>
having them yearly and probably in at least three locations in CA. <br/>
<br/>
Keep 'boxing and remember to use a stick and glove when reaching into <br/>
holes,<br/>
