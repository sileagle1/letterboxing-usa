Hello.  I've been reading about letterboxing here and there since I <br/>
first saw information posted about it on a rubberstamping site.  I'd <br/>
really like to start some more boxes here in CA.  But I think I'll do <br/>
a bit more research and just hang around before I jump right in.  <br/>
It sounds like a fun hobby I'd really like to be a part of. <br/>
Does anyone know if the Boys Scouts involve themselves in this?  It <br/>
sounds like a great learning experience for the children w/ hiking <br/>
already included in the package.  Just curious...<br/>
