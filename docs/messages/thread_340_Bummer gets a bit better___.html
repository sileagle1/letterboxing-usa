As you know, Thom and I each lost a box in the Rock Creek area recently.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't think to notify you earlier, but I replaced my Coon's Cache Letterbox<br/>
this last weekend.  It is exactly where it was before.  The new stamp is<br/>
similar to the original, but is bigger and more detailed.  I have included it<br/>
(as well as the Rock Creek Dragon stamp) at the bottom of my personal<br/>
webpage...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Please note that the original Coon's Cache stamp was never published, and only<br/>
6 people collected its imprint.  Also, please note that anytime I publish my<br/>
letterbox stamp images, they have been altered in regard to size.  They are<br/>
accurate representations of the stamp image, but are not to scale, so that a<br/>
copy printed off the internet could not possibly be mistaken for an original<br/>
imprint of the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your interest,<br/>
Der Mad Stamper<br/>
