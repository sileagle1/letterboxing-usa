I'm a bit taken back by this.  I realize that this is a free country, <br/>
and that many people don't see the danger in witchcraft, but is a <br/>
letterbox that glorifies the Occult proper for a family oriented <br/>
hobby?  I'm particularly concerned that this letterbox is <br/>
a "hitchhiker".  If I understand correctly, they are a surprise form <br/>
of letterbox that travels around.  At least if it was fixed, those of <br/>
us who did not want to be subjected to Satanic influences could avoid <br/>
it.  If it is a surprise, it could show up in any letterbox.  I would <br/>
like to suggest that this letterbox be withdrawn, or at a minimum be <br/>
made a fixed letterbox.<br/>

I'm sorry, but I must respond to this... First and foremost, I do not mean to attack anyone for whatever beliefs that they may or may not have. I was raised as a Southern Baptist.  I've read my bible from cover to cover.  I no longer attend church or organized religion in any manner because of knee jerk reactions such as this letter.  I'm sorry, please do not take any offense at what I am saying here, I try not to offend anyone with my words, but where did it say that you were being subjected to anything?  The name of the stamp is "The Witchcraft Hitchhiker".  I fail to see the satanic influences that a name can carry.  Without seeing the stamp, you've no idea what it even looks like.  I doubt very seriously that it depicts a Coven in a ritualistic circle, or naked people dancing in the moonlight, though that is a possibility as well as a pentagram.<br/>
<br/>
Please understand that I refuse to allow others to detract from my fun.... I too bring my family with me, hence the name "Team Rayvenhaus" and RayvenDad, RayvenMom, and the RayvenKids. We have a blast and I'll share a few things with you here.... I've seen more on these wondrous trails of America than a hand carved stamp could represent as far as human nature, both the good, and the bad.<br/>
<br/>
Before you go running around screaming satanic influence and devil worshiping here, perhaps we need to step back and remember that we are ALL god's children.  And I seriously doubt that he is as upset over this "Witchcraft Hitchhiker" stamp as you are.<br/>
<br/>
We're all here to have fun. I do this because I want to exercise, but walking around the block is boring. My family does it to spend quality time together. And if I come across a hitchhiker or any other stamp for that matter, that I find to be offensive to me, I'll stamp the original box, ignore the hitchhiker and move on. I suggest you do the same.<br/>
<br/>

Yes This "Witchcraft HitchHiker " was placed in a letterbox with a<br/>
Halloween theme called :<br/>
" Legend of Sleepy Hollow "<br/>
  (the headless horseman) letterbox.<br/>
(BTW the best carved stamp I have ever seen)<br/>
<br/>
I didn't sit down and think of who it would offend....sorry. <br/>
