                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday was a beautiful day in Virginia and I took off to <br/>
Fountainhead Park (Fairfax Co) to look for the Scooby Series aka The  <br/>
Creature of Fountainhead Park.  This is a series of 5 boxes.  The <br/>
first 2 boxes are kid-friendly.  Then you have to cross a creek - you <br/>
can almost hear the scary music as you approach the creek, take a <br/>
left, and see that the place you are supposed to cross is under water. <br/>
Even the wobbly pipes aren't there.  Two joggers showed me an <br/>
alternate crossing to the right as you approach the creek.  The scary <br/>
music was still playing in my head as I made it across the pointy tops <br/>
of rocks that were barely above the water surface.  Then I was on the <br/>
other side and needed to head left and had to cross a side creek that <br/>
comes into the main creek.  I easily jumped across this little creek - <br/>
the opposite bank is about 3 feet lower than the bank I was on.<br/>
<br/>
The real trouble came on the way back to the car.  I couldn't go <br/>
across the pointy rocks because I couldn't get up the little creek <br/>
bank to make my way back to the pointy rocks.  There were no other <br/>
rock crossings.  What to do, what to do?  Aha - there are mounds of <br/>
pea gravel in the creek rising barely above the water.  There are foot <br/>
prints in the gravel!  Eureka!  I could jump across the water to the <br/>
mounds of pea gravel.  Joyful tunes were playing in my head.  Until I <br/>
stepped on the pea gravel.  And sunk in pea gravel soup about 8 <br/>
inches. Then I knew why the other footprints were about 4 inches deep.   <br/>
I pulled my feet out (shoes stayed on!) and dragged pounds of wet pea <br/>
gravel to the opposite shore.  Fortunately, I had another pair of <br/>
socks so I could shed the gritty pair.  But I still had to walk about <br/>
a half mile back to the car with wet shoes and muddy wet ankles.<br/>
<br/>
So the warning is this:  Do not try to cross the creek with children.  <br/>
Don't even go to the creek because it is a vigorous climb back up the <br/>
hill to get back to your car.  The only time it might be possible to <br/>
cross the creek is after a summer of drought so that the flat stones <br/>
at the crossing place are above water.  Or just take off your shoes <br/>
and socks, roll up your pants legs, and wade across.  You might not <br/>
want to try this in March.<br/>
<br/>
Mary, glad no one saw me sink in the creek<br/>
