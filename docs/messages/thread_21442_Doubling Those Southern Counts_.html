Recovering at last from a bout of the flu and a twisted ankle that swelled up <br/>
like an orange a week or so ago, but is now mostly just a painful patch of <br/>
purple, I'm finally getting a chance to write up my long overdue Southern trip <br/>
report. Originally Pete and I had planned to just fly down to Florida for a 5-day <br/>
cruise to the Bahamas at the end of January, but then I decided I might as well <br/>
drive down and stay awhile to visit friends, letterbox, folkdance, attend a <br/>
gathering or two, and do hurricane relief work in the Punta Gorda area with a <br/>
team from our church in RI.  So, that's just what I did, and it turned out to be <br/>
quite a good month, with over 300 new letterboxes found along the way, and <br/>
with some of my personal state counts getting doubled (VA,MD), quadrupled <br/>
(FL), or even sextupled (NC,SC)!!! (The inside joke here being that my GA <br/>
count also doubled - from 1 to 2, but -hey- there just aren't that many boxes <br/>
along the I-95 corridor in Georgia, so that's all I could do without going too far <br/>
out of my way! Don't worry, though - I definitely hope to make another foray <br/>
down to the more boxious parts of some of those states sometime soon, so <br/>
we'll just have to wait and see what happens then!) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'd have to say that we were pretty pleased overall with the quality <br/>
and quantity of boxes we found this trip. There were many more boxes than <br/>
when Pete and I last drove down that way a couple of years ago, so we <br/>
obviously didn't have time for them all, but we tried to do a fair sampling of <br/>
both older and newer planters, Our favorite boxes, naturally, were those like <br/>
"Myakka River Critters" and  "Bitter Orange Cracker Shack" in the larger <br/>
preserves. We even managed to plant a couple of boxes ourselves, with <br/>
stamps by Scarab of VA ("Nosey Bee") and RTRW of CT ("Boardwalk <br/>
Beebop"), in parks where we saw whole families of wild boar, armadillos, and <br/>
baby alligators! I also enjoyed watching the manatees, letterboxing with Irene, <br/>
folkdancing with Ralika, Annie, Andy, and the "Gotta Dancers", painting <br/>
John's formerly devastated house sea turtle green, and attending DebBee's <br/>
Fabulous Florida Flamingo Fiesta, which kept its theme all the way through to <br/>
the flamingo-shaped cookies and other things that went so well with those <br/>
flamingo lawn ornaments!  A big "thank-you" to everyone involved, and <br/>
especially also to the Doubtful Guests for their hospitality, for taking me on <br/>
"drive-bys" in MD after I'd fallen and twisted my ankle in VA following a long <br/>
day of letterboxing in Richmond, and for the impromptu little "Bee Gathering" <br/>
that really lifted my spirits! I think everyone would be amazed at how many <br/>
boxes I still managed to hobble to on my way home in the rain even with my <br/>
leg taped up, but I just kept going until a nasty flu finally did me in just as I was <br/>
getting back to RI!  I spent several days in bed, then Pete took me to the <br/>
Dance Flurry in Saratoga Springs, NY over the past weekend, and now he's <br/>
sick, too! Oh, well... hope we all feel better soon, so we can get in a bit more <br/>
skiing and winter 'boxing before the season's over! <br/>
<br/>
 At least now after visiting the Southern states, I can feel that I have a little <br/>
leeway before all those CT boxes once again try to gobble up almost half of <br/>
my total F-count, as they seem to have been trying to do for almost my entire <br/>
letterboxing history! When I saw my CT state count creeping up to 3000 found <br/>
boxes late last year, all I could think was that I'd have to start 'boxing more <br/>
systematically in other states just to keep CT at "half bay", so that is exactly <br/>
what I intend to do! (Unless, of course, I decide to leave letterboxing <br/>
completely behind for a while as I quietly slip off to hike the "King of Trails" <br/>
again - and for those who don't know, that's not the AT or the PCT, but the <br/>
grand old Continental Divide!) Meanwhile, thanks again to all those folks who, <br/>
instead of just keeping boxes in private circles, have at least in theory, placed <br/>
boxes out there to share with everyone - and that even includes the mapsurfer <br/>
boxes, 44 of which we got a long while back before "hitting the wall", but at <br/>
least they're all supposedly still out there for anyone interested!  Cheers to all <br/>
the great "equal opportunity planters" everywhere! <br/>
We love you!<br/>

I just love hearing about the adventures of Wanda and Pete.<br/>
<br/>
I hope your ankle is feeling better. I can totally relate as I managed to<br/>
twist my ankle two weeks ago before I had even gotten in the building on my<br/>
first day of work with Audubon Rhode Island (who actually have a formal<br/>
no-letterboxing/geocaching policy...don't worry, I will be trying to gently<br/>
convince them otherwise).<br/>
<br/>
I really admire all you manage to fit in to all your trips, from community<br/>
volunteering, to helping friends to doing trail work etc. (I am also jealous<br/>
of all the critters you managed to see). Your generosity is a rare and<br/>
wonderful thing.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully Christopher and I will get out to box soon. We are a bit<br/>
embarrassed to say the winter weather leaves us rather reluctant to leave<br/>
the warm house. Christopher doesn't like x-country skiing or snowshoeing, so<br/>
we are a bit limited there. But I am working on a new mystery box, so that's<br/>
keeping me in the loop.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, stay well and hopefully we'll see you soon.<br/>
-Kim and Christopher<br/>
(Rustypuff and CSCM)<br/>
