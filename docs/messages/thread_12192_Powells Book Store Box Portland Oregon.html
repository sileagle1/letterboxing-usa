<br/>
Here is the deal .... seems like Powells rearranged the seating in their book store here recently and low and behold a letter box dissapeared....<br/>
Well well.. that just is not smurfy... sooo here is what we have done. I've been pretty sick recenlty but managed to carve a replacement stamp.  I put it in the mail to Iron`Bear yesterday.  He should recieve it and then he will go back to Powells (since he lives so close) and we will find a new and hopefully more permanant location for the letterbox... we will using the same clues, however, we will be posting additional clues to get you from where the letterbox *was* to where it *is* .... be on the lookout for more... clues to come in the next week or so...<br/>

my family in Portland this summer and take my sons, who've never been there, <br/>
on a pilgrimage to world's greatest book store and we'll look for the box.  <br/>
Thanks very much for putting one there!  Mother of Crickets<br/>
