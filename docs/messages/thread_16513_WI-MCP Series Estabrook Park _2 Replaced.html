Thanks to all of you that wrote me about its disappearance!  I had carved a<br/>
replacement a while ago, but I was so involved in the Packers game, I carved<br/>
part of it backwards!  It took me a while to find time to carve it again.  I<br/>
hope the new stamp fits the puzzle okay.  If any of you that emailed me go<br/>
and find the new stamp, please let me know how it fits!  Thanks!<br/>

BTW - the clues and hiding spot was not changed.<br/>
