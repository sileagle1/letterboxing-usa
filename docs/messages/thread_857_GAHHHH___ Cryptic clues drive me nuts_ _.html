box, and I really think you should check on it.  The area took extensive flood<br/>
damage, and it seems part of your clue is no longer there.  I found it last<br/>
time, so I know what I was looking for, the four and two score.  Also, the<br/>
entire area was under at least a foot of water, so I'm not sure if the box<br/>
location is secure, being that I never found it :)  So, Randy, if you could<br/>
let me know if you ever check on it, and if the clue is going to change or<br/>
anything.  Thanks!<br/>

Actually, I like the fact that the starting point is ambigious.  Some sort<br/>
of checking scheme would be nice (to eliminate being in the wrong<br/>
state.)  Perhaps something like, "Enter_the_name_of_the_state_park".html<br/>
would be useful for those who wish to have the verification.  <br/>
<br/>
Not for me though, considering that I just started research on "Merlin's<br/>
Pre-columbian," and the research itself is very exciting.  Randy, I wish I<br/>
knew how you came up with this stuff, it is great!!!  I figured out 2 or<br/>
three visions, and hope to find the third soon.  I like the challenge,<br/>
especially if I am able to beat the Drew clan or Sara to the box...<br/>

&gt; Hey folks.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can those with mystery letterboxes at LEAST give a STARTING POINT?<br/>
&gt; Even something like... "start in FLORIDA".... or... "all these clues <br/>
&gt; are from Sherlock Holmes books".... at least we would know if we have <br/>
&gt; a CHANCE of ever finding the dang thing.<br/>
