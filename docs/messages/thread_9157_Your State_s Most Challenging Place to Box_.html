Park near Fredericksburg, Virginia recently, and it took us about four<br/>
hours to find most of the boxes there. Admittedly, I needed a break<br/>
here and there, so I'm sure other boxers wouldn't need four hours per<br/>
se, yet there's no denying that the distances are rather great between<br/>
each box at this park, and judging by the comments in some of the<br/>
logbooks, I wasn't the only boxer who found all the footwork in this<br/>
large state park challenging.<br/>
<br/>
Large distances between individual boxes is also true for another<br/>
Virginia state park, Pocahontas. And there seem to be a lot more hills<br/>
at Pocahontas, too.<br/>
<br/>
In my limited boxing experience, Pocahontas would seem to be the most<br/>
challenging spot in Virginia to look for boxes. Anyone agree? Disagree?<br/>
<br/>
What about other states? And is this spot difficult because of the<br/>
terrain, the sheer number of boxes there, the complicated clues, or what?<br/>
<br/>
BTW, daughteroftheolddominion and I found 5 of the 6 Lake Anna boxes,<br/>
and they were all intact. We also found Jolly G-Man's Mr. Lee and Mr.<br/>

safe Mr. Lee will be in the future because houses are being built all<br/>

Hi Marsha,<br/>
<br/>
In Ohio, we have two all day affairs:<br/>
<br/>
John Bryan SP and Glen Helen Park(Which have a common border) have a <br/>
total of 35 boxes, including the 27 box Valley of the Frogs.  <br/>
<br/>
East Fork Lake State park has at least 23 boxes scattered in 3 major <br/>
areas of the park.  <br/>
<br/>
Worthy of mention are several other parks with about 8 boxes apiece.  <br/>
Those Cincinnati boxers are really busy little boxers. <br/>
<br/>
See <br/>
http://www.flyfisher-kayaks.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl<br/>
for a catalog of the boxes by park. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I can't speak from my own personal experience in finding boxes in <br/>
Michigan, but from comments I've gotten back regarding boxes I've <br/>
placed here, those up in the sand dunes of Hoffmaster and Muskegon <br/>
State Park seem to draw the most "you really made us work for this <br/>
one" reactions.  I agree they can be grueling climbs, especially when <br/>
it is 95 degrees out, but the view is so incredible once you get up <br/>
there, it is certainly worth it, even without a box as a prize!<br/>
<br/>
Again, I think everyone has their own angle...  some are in for the <br/>
hike, some for a challenge (physical and/or mental), others just want <br/>
to collect stamps.  They all have their place.  When I read trail <br/>
reports of finding 15-16 boxes in a day, I am in awe...  as I would <br/>
consider 4-5 boxes to be a productive day.  Of course, a big part of <br/>
it is where you live.  The boxes on the East Coast are much closer to <br/>
each other simply because there are so many of them, just like the <br/>
concentration in the Cincinnati area.<br/>
<br/>
I like it when the hike is not too long and there are many boxes in <br/>
one place when I am traveling, but for the most part -- I want a <br/>
challenge, mentally and physically and would much prefer spending 2 <br/>
hours hiking 5 miles to get one box that tested me, than several <br/>
boxes that were all waiting in a row, waving their hands as I walked <br/>
by.<br/>

<br/>
"Blurred Borders" is an excellent series and I highly recommend it.<br/>
<br/>
We where thinking about doing "Feathers in your Cap" this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
"The Phantom" at the Blue Hills in Milton MA is a very challenging <br/>
find<br/>
also.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">i have found the most challenging box to be the nelson<br/>
county box. im not sure we ever actually found it, but<br/>
we did get one (i think by accident) near the end of<br/>
the clues called spy rock, which i cannot find listed<br/>
otherwise. we were huffing and whimpering at the top<br/>
of the FIRST hill, and a few directions could be added<br/>
as a lead-in to what is posted, but determined to come<br/>
home with something. woof, what a hike. <br/>
<br/>
i WANT to place one in a wierd little place not<br/>
accessable by foot, but open to the public, but i<br/>
think a $15 fee per person might be a turnoff. (thats<br/>
for public transport to the spot, not to visit<br/>
independantly) any thoughts? i got all excited and<br/>
carved the stamp before i researched that far.<br/>
<br/>
i got all 8 at pocahontas in one day. i must admit i<br/>
was gritting my teeth at pocahontas/powatan/john<br/>
smith, but i finally located them- and the treasure<br/>
was a nice reward once i had finally found those 3-<br/>
but it was worth the jaunt. i was WITHOUT child(ren)<br/>
and spouse expressed displeasure at spending ALL DAY<br/>
alone out of town, but it wasnt that tough to me.<br/>
<br/>
i live in tidewater and still havent gotten them all<br/>
at seashore- the day we went child(ren) and spouse<br/>
became whiny and we had to give up.<br/>
<br/>
i think legnthy instructions to one box would almost<br/>
have to be more challenging than a bunch in one park-<br/>
but i hate to see people tuck and run after one box<br/>
instead of seeing the whole park. i want to research<br/>
before my next jaunt the permission recieved at<br/>
specific parks... to plant a second box while i am<br/>
there. there are alot of beautiful places in virginia<br/>
that go unexplored/unenjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
remember, its (usually) free, its not fattening, and<br/>
its fun.<br/>

<br/>
Why, there was a series that Don and Gwen hid here in Oregon <br/>
which required a TWENTY-FIVE mile to get.  Paradise Lodge.  <br/>
Practically hiked non-stop from sunrise to sunset to nab those <br/>
boxes.  Even brough a water filter with me figuring I'd probably <br/>
run out long before I made it back to my car.  And boy were my <br/>
feet sore getting back.<br/>
<br/>
One of the letterboxes I placed requires a 12 mile hike <br/>
(more-or-less) with a nearly 5,000 foot elevation gain, which is a <br/>
pretty tough hike too.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm planning to hide a couple that nobody has a prayer of <br/>
reaching unless they do some backpacking to get to them.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you're talking about cryptic clues that are tough to <br/>
solve, I spent about six months working out Spirit of Dartmoor.  <br/>
And many people still haven't figured out Around the World in 80 <br/>
Days.<br/>
<br/>
I've though hiding one half way up the face of Half Dome might <br/>
be kind of cool too, but I'm not really a rock climber so I'll have to <br/>
let somebody else do that one.  I'll be happy to carve a stamp for <br/>
it, though!<br/>

Guilty as charged, psycomommy.  The time I'm able to devote to hiking <br/>
and letterboxing is scarce, so when I'm out, I'm usually out for the <br/>
day and try to make the most of it.  I equate challenging hikes with <br/>
elevation because that's what challenges my body the most, and <br/>
challenging letterboxing with boxes that take several attempts to <br/>
find.  In that regard, I'd have to count Nelson County as the most <br/>
challenging I've attempted...the elevation was more than I was <br/>
prepared for at the time and I came away without the box.  On the way <br/>
to spy rock we were turned back by a huge rattler lying across the <br/>
trail, so that hike/box is on my list to revisit the next time I've <br/>
got time and am up for the challenge.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the mountains in the east....you only have to drive through <br/>
southwest Virginia and the Smokies in Tennessee to answer that one.  <br/>
Two recent trips to Tennessee have made a believer out of me!  The <br/>
mountains there took my breath away...and I wasn't even hiking at the <br/>
time!  Anyone in the area of Davy Crockett State Park outside <br/>
Greeneville TN should visit and snag the Davy Crockett box...it's an <br/>
awesome hike along a ledge following a river and a very unusual stamp <br/>
as reward.<br/>
