                    <div class="plaintext-content">As more letterboxes are planted along with even more geocaches, it <br/>
is a matter of time before they get mixed up. This actually happened <br/>
to me. There is an Lb up near Inlet, NY called Cathedral in the <br/>
Pines. It is a nice solemn place. When I found the Lb, it had stuff <br/>
in it other than the stamp and notebook. I don't remember specifics, <br/>
but I couldn't figure it out. <br/>
<br/>
Well, recently we are going back into the area for more Lb's and a <br/>
few Geocaches as I recently began that hobby. When I looked up Inlet <br/>
on Geocaching.com I found one near the above Lb. When I read through <br/>
some of the recent finds, I found one that said that he wasn't able <br/>
to find the GC, but found a letterbox and put a Travel Bug in it <br/>
(Something akin to a hitchhiker). Now for the Lb'er what are they <br/>
supposed to do with a travel bug? The part that bothers me is that <br/>
person knew that what he found was an Lb and that he wanted to place <br/>
the TB, so he put it in the letterbox. That is not fair for the <br/>
letterboxers as they are not going to know what to do with a TB and <br/>
may just take as a souvenir. It isn't fair to the owner of the TB as <br/>
it may end up out of circulation before it accomplishes its goal.<br/>
<br/>
Do any of you have similar experiences? I think that GC'ers and <br/>
Lb'ers need to be aware of one another and need to give one another <br/>
some space, which is difficult for the letterboxer who doesn't have <br/>
a GPS. I see this problem increasing, and I am  worried for the <br/>
stamps getting traded for geocaching swag.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Random Thought 1. I once found a box in Vermont (Kent Pond? Busy <br/>
Beaver?) That was found by the Geo crowd. They were very confused, <br/>
left a few trinkets and signed the log. Luckily they did not take <br/>
anything. It amazed me how far away the geo cache was and they <br/>
stumbled across the box. I think this is one reason why some boxes <br/>
disappear, the finder has no interest doing a good job rehiding. (But <br/>
then again I think some boxers are not great in that category either!) <br/>
I found the Geo cache later because it was totally un covered in the <br/>
roots of a tree, within sight of another closer box.<br/>
<br/>
Thought 2. I just had two geocachers log into a box of mine because <br/>
they were way off tract looking for a new cache. I knew one of the two <br/>
and would call him an accidental boxer. He tried boxing, but loves the <br/>
geo thing. So he stamps in a box he finds by accident. The second guy <br/>
called the box a "Letterbox cache" and signed in. Everything was in <br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>
Thought 3. A Geocacher e-mailed me if it was alright to use one of my <br/>
boxes (in Norwalk, CT) as a part of the clue to find his geocache. I <br/>
had no problem. In fact, I thought it was a great idea. <br/>
<br/>
Thought 4. I have a PFX of 257 and about 30 geocaches, does that make <br/>
me only a little evil? :)  <br/>
<br/>
Which leads me to ask--What percentage of boxers are geocachers?<br/>
<br/>
Thought 5. Keep your boxes a good 40 feet away from any geocache if <br/>
you can, it will be found if it is less then this. Geocaches are many <br/>
times in green containers that are hard to spot. Letterboxes are <br/>
usually in containers that are easier to see. I once was actually <br/>
sitting on a geocache in Cranbury park Norwalk, CT. thinking that the <br/>
spot would make a good placement spot for a box and looked down. It <br/>
was more then a little bit of a shock to see my foot on the ammunition <br/>
container!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm a boxer who geocaches also.  I mainly cache when I don't have time to<br/>
make the trip to find boxes I haven't found yet and it gives me a hunting<br/>
fix.  I'm not very good at it though.  My LB success rate is somewhere<br/>
around 95% or a little better, where my GC success rate is about 25%.  There<br/>
is a mindset thing I haven't ironed out yet I think.<br/>
<br/>
Here in Texas I've noticed that GC'ers are getting a whiff of LB'ing and are<br/>
getting interested or at least aware.  The ones who have taken the time to<br/>
learn about it are respectful of LBs.  Of course, those are also the ones<br/>
that seem to place pretty good caches.  I've noticed that folks who do sorry<br/>
caches also seem to blow through LBs when they find them by accident and<br/>
toss them aside.  Anyway, I love to see accidental finders sign my logs to<br/>
let me know they were there.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started learning about GC'ing, I tended to think of it as an<br/>
artless imposter - after all, in LBing, we put a lot more into the making of<br/>
our boxes by the time we put the log together and carve the stamp, where<br/>
they generally put strips of paper in a box for the log, chunk some trinkets<br/>
in on top of it (assuming it isn't a micro, as most of them around here<br/>
are), hide it and post coordinates.  What I finally realized is that their<br/>
art is in the hide.  I once found one that was hidden in a hollowed out pine<br/>
cone placed in a pine tree.  What made me finally spot it?  I have no<br/>
earthly idea!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as I've learned more about and done more GC'ing, I've come to<br/>
respect it more, even though I still much prefer LB'ing.  But I also see my<br/>
friends in the GC world learning more about LB'ing and developing a<br/>
reciprocal respect.  I think that as more of us on both sides of the fence<br/>
become more aware, it can only be a good thing.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am not personally a geocacher, but have had mostly positive experiences with them in this area (West Michigan) and there are several teams that do both.  I have three different letterboxes that have been within 6 feet of geocaches for a couple of years.  In one case, the log had more sign-ins from geocachers than letterboxers.  The cachers had flipped the book over and began signing in from the back and the letterboxers continued stamping in from the front.  There never seemed to be any conflict or problem with these particular boxes/caches.  Cachers often noted the finding of the letterbox in their online logs, which probably alerted less informed cachers to its existence.  All of these letterboxes are still in place, although two of the caches are now gone.<br/>
<br/>
In one other situation, a letterbox I maintained was actually sharing space with a geocache -- it didn't start out this way, but no matter how many times I moved the box back to its intended spot, when I would stop to check on it, it was back in bed with the geocache.  They co-existed like this for a couple of years until the cache went missing, and then mysteriously the box went missing within a few weeks after that.  I have my suspicions on that one, but who really knows...  <br/>
<br/>
In one other situation I have a letterbox that was located very near a cache.  It was closer to the trail than the cache was and for this reason the cachers were always finding it first.  This box was frequently left out in the open, uncovered, even unopened a few times -- even though the other 3 boxes in the series were always very well rehidden, etc.  I moved the letterbox to another hiding spot -- only a few feet away, although further away from the trail than the cache.  It has been fine ever since.<br/>
<br/>
I think more geocachers are aware of letterboxing now than they were only a couple of years ago.  With the exception of a few, the majority of cachers respect letterboxes they come across (and we have those bad apples who call themselves letterboxers also).  I think the two can co-exist with a little forethought and common sense -- 1) be sure to label your letterbox well so that it is not as easily mistaken for a cache by those who perhaps are not as familiar with the difference, 2) as a placer be aware of the caches in your area and in the places where you are planting boxes -- keep your boxes out of the direct line of traffic that a cacher would take when looking for his prize, and 3) monitor the geocache logs for those caches located near your letterboxes (you can sign up to have them e-mailed to you).<br/>

I had been hoping for years to plant a box in a Sunken Garden in<br/>
Maine. I was recently in the area and decided to investigate. I didn't<br/>
have a box to plant, rather I was just soaking up the beauty and<br/>
scouting out a spot for future planting. After having many adventures<br/>
planting in urban spots (especially gardens) I know some of the<br/>
pitfalls to those tricky locations. After spending at least a 1/2 hour<br/>
in the same small garden I came upon the only spot that would make sense.<br/>
<br/>
I carefully moved aside the objects to reveal the proposed hiding spot<br/>
and putting my hand inside the crevace found a small container! I was<br/>
utterly surprised and delighted. It turns out that the container held<br/>
the contents of a geocache. I felt as though I had truly encountered a<br/>
treasure in a secret garden, the same feeling that I hope others have<br/>
when the visit some of the places that I lead them to in my own<br/>
letterbox clues. It was after this moment that I realized there would<br/>
be no need to plant a letterbox here - I had enjoyed the spot in a<br/>
different way despite the fact that I wasn't a geocacher.<br/>
<br/>
I do not usually follow caching, but there's something to be said for<br/>
this person's ability to find a discrete spot and have a letterboxer<br/>
pick up on it - as I like to say, great minds think alike. I really<br/>
had to give this person credit for such a sweet location and just<br/>
chalk up my idea for planting one as too late.  <br/>
<br/>
This was the second time that I had ever stumbled across a cache, but<br/>
in the most interesting and magical way. <br/>

There is no way to be 100% sure there are no caches. Part of the problem is  <br/>
that there are many different types of caches. Most of them are standard <br/>
caches  but there are some multi caches. With multi caches you are given a  <br/>
coordinate and when you get there you are given another coordinate and so on.  You <br/>
wouldn't know where the actual cache is without going through all of the  stages.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, you could create an account on geocaching.com (you may not  need <br/>
an account but I don't recall) and look up all caches by zip code. The  <br/>
resulting list will be sorted by distance from the zip code you entered. You  could <br/>
then click on each one and there will be links that will show you a map of  <br/>
where the cache is located (or starting point in the event of a multi cache).  <br/>
There are other links that will show "nearby caches" also.<br/>
<br/>
One other option is to try to get in touch with one of the local cachers  and <br/>
ask if there are any located in the area in which you would like to plant a  <br/>
box. Chances are that cacher has already found the ones nearby and can tell <br/>
you  specifically if one is close by.<br/>

shocked, because there are so few Lb's in the state.  This is one <br/>
reason I am also getting into geocaching.<br/>
<br/>
One neat thing about the geocaching site is they have a cache category <br/>
called Letterbox Hybrid.  It is set up like a letterbox AND a <br/>
geocache.  There is a logbook and stamp, as well as the little trading <br/>
trinkets.  I think this is what I will do when I start planting <br/>
boxes.  Hubby likes having coordinates.<br/>

I'm thinking of converting some of my letterboxes to hybrids.  I probably<br/>
won't do it with my boxes that I'm strongly attached to though, not so much<br/>

letterboxers and for a letterboxer's appreciation of the art.  I don't think<br/>
they would hold the same appeal for geocachers.<br/>

Eowyn and I found it by headlamp. Enjoyed the nice place to log in. <br/>
As a letterboxer I was disappointed that there was no stamp. I <br/>

another <br/>

&gt; as <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; it may end up out of circulation before it accomplishes its goal.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Do any of you have similar experiences? I think that GC'ers and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Lb'ers need to be aware of one another and need to give one<br/>
&gt; another <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; some space, which is difficult for the letterboxer who doesn't<br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; a GPS. I see this problem increasing, and I am  worried for the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; stamps getting traded for geocaching swag.<br/>

I would say that the major difference is that geocaching is high tech in that a GPS unit is needed to find a hidden box. The hider posts latitude/longitude coordinates on the web so that a seeker can enter the coordinates into their GPS unit in order to find the box. Often extra clues are provided by the hider because coords take you to, at best, a 5 meter radius of the hiding spot. Letterboxing is lower tech, the hider gives the seeker directions to the hidden box (often online, sometimes word-of-mouth). <br/>
<br/>
They are similar because they are both hide 'n seek treasure hunting games. The goal in both games is to find a hidden container. <br/>
<br/>
The treasure in geocaching are trinkets - take a trinket and leave a trinket. The treasure in letterboxing is a stamp image - take an impression of the box's stamp for your personal logbook and leave an impression of your signature stamp image in the box's logbook.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to really understand the similarities and differences is to get out there and find a variety of letterboxes and geocaches. <br/>
<br/>
Happy trails to you. :)<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, recently we are going back into the area for more Lb's and a<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; few Geocaches as I recently began that hobby. When I looked up<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Inlet <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on Geocaching.com I found one near the above Lb. When I read<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; through <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some of the recent finds, I found one that said that he wasn't<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; able <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to find the GC, but found a letterbox and put a Travel Bug in it<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (Something akin to a hitchhiker). Now for the Lb'er what are they<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; supposed to do with a travel bug? The part that bothers me is that<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some space, which is difficult for the letterboxer who doesn't<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; have <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a GPS. I see this problem increasing, and I am worried for the<br/>

&gt; hider<br/>
&gt; &gt; because coords take you to, at best, a 5 meter radius of the hiding<br/>
&gt; spot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Letterboxing is lower tech, the hider gives the seeker directions to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; hidden box (often online, sometimes word-of-mouth).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; They are similar because they are both hide 'n seek treasure hunting<br/>
&gt; games.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The goal in both games is to find a hidden container.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The treasure in geocaching are trinkets - take a trinket and leave a<br/>
&gt; trinket.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The treasure in letterboxing is a stamp image - take an impression of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; box's stamp for your personal logbook and leave an impression of your<br/>
&gt; &gt; signature stamp image in the box's logbook.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The best way to really understand the similarities and differences is to<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt; out there and find a variety of letterboxes and geocaches.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; August 2 by theDoubtfulGuests (52 found)<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What a great hide. Lots of fun to find, especially in the Dark.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Eowyn and I found it by headlamp. Enjoyed the nice place to log in.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As a letterboxer I was disappointed that there was no stamp. I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; assume there was one and a cacher mistakenly took it in trade. Will<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cachers ever learn?? Eowyn stamped in with her fab stamp. That will<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; show you cachers what stamp art is all about.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for the fun.<br/>

To find out what geocaches are near you, type your zip code (or postal code if you live in Canada) into the "Search for caches..." zipcode box. It's at the top right corner of the homepage.<br/>

To find out what geocaches are near you, type your zip code (or postal code if you live in Canada) into the "Search for caches..." zipcode box. It's at the top right corner of the homepage.<br/>

&gt; I am both a letterboxer and a geocacher.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would say that the major difference is that geocaching is high tech in that<br/>
&gt; a GPS unit is needed to find a hidden box. The hider posts latitude/longitude<br/>
&gt; coordinates on the web so that a seeker can enter the coordinates into their<br/>
&gt; GPS unit in order to find the box. Often extra clues are provided by the hider<br/>
&gt; because coords take you to, at best, a 5 meter radius of the hiding spot.<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing is lower tech, the hider gives the seeker directions to the<br/>
&gt; hidden box (often online, sometimes word-of-mouth).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They are similar because they are both hide 'n seek treasure hunting games.<br/>
&gt; The goal in both games is to find a hidden container.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The treasure in geocaching are trinkets - take a trinket and leave a trinket.<br/>
&gt; The treasure in letterboxing is a stamp image - take an impression of the<br/>
&gt; box's stamp for your personal logbook and leave an impression of your<br/>
&gt; signature stamp image in the box's logbook.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The best way to really understand the similarities and differences is to get<br/>
&gt; out there and find a variety of letterboxes and geocaches.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy trails to you. :)<br/>

been geocaching for over 4 years now. One of the major geocaching <br/>
websites is www.geocaching.com , (this has hundreds of thousands of <br/>
geocaches worldwide), and another we belong to is at <br/>
www.terracaching.com .  The second one is not as user friendly, and <br/>
is much smaller.  For example, within 100 miles of my house is over <br/>
2700 caches (of different types) posted on the geocaching.com <br/>
website, but there are probably only about 75 within that same <br/>
radius on the terracaching site.  There is no fee required for <br/>
either site, but you can help support the websites by purchasing a <br/>
premium membership ($30 a year), which also gets you some other <br/>
benefits.  You can browse the site, copy the coordinates, etc, <br/>
create a member name and log finds with no charge.  Unfortunately, a <br/>
website of that magnitude and detail has to be supported financially <br/>
some way, and a membership does help some.  Let me know if you have <br/>
any other questions, and I would be happy to help.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; August 2 by theDoubtfulGuests (52 found)<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What a great hide. Lots of fun to find, especially in the <br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Eowyn and I found it by headlamp. Enjoyed the nice place to <br/>
log in.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As a letterboxer I was disappointed that there was no stamp. I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; assume there was one and a cacher mistakenly took it in <br/>
trade. Will<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cachers ever learn?? Eowyn stamped in with her fab stamp. <br/>
That will<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; show you cachers what stamp art is all about.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is a matter of time before they get mixed up. This <br/>
actually<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; happened <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to me. There is an Lb up near Inlet, NY called Cathedral <br/>
in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Pines. It is a nice solemn place. When I found the Lb, <br/>
it had<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; stuff <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in it other than the stamp and notebook. I don't remember<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; specifics, <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; but I couldn't figure it out.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Well, recently we are going back into the area for more <br/>
Lb's and a<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; few Geocaches as I recently began that hobby. When I <br/>
looked up<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Inlet <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on Geocaching.com I found one near the above Lb. When I <br/>
read<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; through <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some of the recent finds, I found one that said that he <br/>
wasn't<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; able <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to find the GC, but found a letterbox and put a Travel <br/>
Bug in it<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (Something akin to a hitchhiker). Now for the Lb'er what <br/>
are they<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; supposed to do with a travel bug? The part that bothers <br/>
me is that<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; person knew that what he found was an Lb and that he <br/>
wanted to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; place <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the TB, so he put it in the letterbox. That is not fair <br/>
for the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; letterboxers as they are not going to know what to do <br/>
with a TB<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; may just take as a souvenir. It isn't fair to the owner <br/>
of the TB<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it may end up out of circulation before it accomplishes <br/>
its goal.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Do any of you have similar experiences? I think that <br/>
GC'ers and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Lb'ers need to be aware of one another and need to give <br/>
one<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; another <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some space, which is difficult for the letterboxer who <br/>
doesn't<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a GPS. I see this problem increasing, and I am worried <br/>
for the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; stamps getting traded for geocaching swag.<br/>

"When a Geocacher finds a letterbox by mistake AND DOES NOT REALIZE<br/>
IT, the Geocacher will very commonly take the unique, handcarved<br/>
rubberstamp as a swag item and they leave a cheap dollar store trinket<br/>
in it's place.<br/>
<br/>
This destroys the letterbox because there is no longer a way to<br/>
"login" to the box if you don't have the stamp.... <br/>
<br/>
"Letterboxers generally dislike geocachers because of the confusion<br/>
and damage caused by errant un-informed geocachers. Handcarving stamps<br/>
is pretty difficult &amp; time consuming &amp; these stamps can be pretty<br/>
intricate.<br/>
<br/>
Please if you ever find a "geocache" with a rubber stamp in it. DON'T<br/>
TAKE THE STAMP!!!!! Look very carefully at the box and the log and see<br/>
if it is labled as a geocache or a letterbox."<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
Lot's of similar posts, too. I'm a geocacher who has stumbled across<br/>
several letterboxes. So far, all of them specifically stated "This is<br/>
not a Geocache!"  I have to say, most of the stamps are works of art.<br/>
Sometimes, I've just flipped through the LB log admiring the different<br/>
imprints.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, this and similar posts at geocaching.com will get the word<br/>
out to cachers and help the LB cause.<br/>

<br/>
I have a letterbox that sits in the exact same hiding place as a <br/>
geocache.  They've sat side by side off and on for about 4 years <br/>
without any problems.  I did it this way to limit the social trails <br/>
in the area, figuring each hobbyist could use the same trail.  It's <br/>
been great and I've had no problems of someone finding my box and <br/>
mistaking it for a geocache.<br/>

I check on his geocache and he checks on my letterbox.<br/>

I even found a picture of Mark and Sue in the geocache!  Now that was <br/>
