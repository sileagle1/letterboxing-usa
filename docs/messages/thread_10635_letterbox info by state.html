Click on the book and go crazy.  Enjoy!  <br/>

Some people maintain lists for their own state or region privately.  <br/>
You will find them with time.  Sometimes, because they are less busy <br/>
than our kind Web Volunteers, the clues show up faster.<br/>
<br/>
As I read the daily posts I copy and paste to WORD, clues for my <br/>
region.  I then throw them into a folder on my desktop. That way I <br/>
have clues ready for that weekend, without having to search back.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I miss one, but between our Web master and Mischief who <br/>
keeps a washington state page, we are well covered.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome, it is a very addicting activity.<br/>

I don't know what mail program you use, but Yahoo<br/>
allows me to filter emails to different folders. No<br/>
reason why you couldn't filter every email that has<br/>
"SC" in the header, or something like that. Be aware<br/>
though, that if you make the filter too broad, you'll<br/>
get emails filtered through to the wrong folders.<br/>
Using "SC" and "LbNA" would work better.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, for all the boxes already posted, just go<br/>
to the letterboxing.org website.<br/>
