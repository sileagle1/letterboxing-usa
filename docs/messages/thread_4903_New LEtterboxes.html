3 boxes in the Danbury area:<br/>
<br/>
Box 1 is in Putnam State Park.  At the intersection of routes 58 and 107 in Redding find the<br/>
enterance with the horse then head up the hill. Then keep the spire on your right then past the<br/>
pond on your left. Then from the junction near the pump and stream look for the side trail heading<br/>
NE to the monument to the unknown. Then continue 47 paces on the same trail to a huge boulder on<br/>
the left then 15 paces at 140 degrees to a rock group with three points. Then reach into hole in top.<br/>
<br/>
Box 2 is just down the road. After crossing the Bethel town line turn right into the park and then<br/>
into the first parking lot. Then from the swingset find the building across the road to the southeast.<br/>
At the building the the right path of the trail and keep the building on the right then go upstairs<br/>
to the clearing then downhill and across the road. Then go 30 paces to an evergreen to the north.<br/>
Then 13 paces at 325 degrees from the evergreen to a flat rock.  Then look under the NE end of<br/>
the rock<br/>
<br/>
Box 3 is at WCSU Westside campus in Danbury. The entrance is about 2 miles from exit 2 of<br/>
I 84. Turn right past the big circle into the parking lot for the football field. Then look for a trail <br/>
into the woods and a stone wall. Follow the wall to a junction and look under a pointy rock.<br/>
<br/>
Get there First!<br/>
