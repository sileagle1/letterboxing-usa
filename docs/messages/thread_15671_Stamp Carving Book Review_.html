I have that book and it's not bad. There's lots of detailed pictures and <br/>
instructions for several demo projecs. FYI- She prefers a rather <br/>
"rustic" style of carving, as opposed to a finished appearance. I'm not <br/>
sure it's worth the money though. I read it through once and have maybe <br/>
glanced at it once since then. If you can find a copy at your local <br/>
library or arrange to get it through interlibrary loan that's probably <br/>
your best bet. If not, maybe split the cost with a friend. If you're <br/>
going to be at the Mystery Gathering, I'd be happy to bring it and you <br/>
can take a peek and maybe borrow it for a while if it strikes your fancy.<br/>
