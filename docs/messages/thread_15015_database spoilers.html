                    <div class="plaintext-content">One drawback of such a database would be if the box is just plain <br/>
difficult to find (be it due to a great hiding spot, incredible <br/>
camouflage or excitingly vague clues).  <br/>
<br/>
For Example:  We recently found a box in a remote location that was <br/>
considered 'missing' by multiple letterboxers--even pronounced <br/>
missing on the list by someone other than the 'placer' themselves.  <br/>
That message discouraged many future letterboxers from even <br/>
attempting the trek.  The only reason we even continued to visit the <br/>
area was the allure of a nearby waterfall (avid photographer) and to <br/>
see a new part of the area we hadn't yet visited on many previous <br/>
visits to the region.  We went on the trek, sought out the letterbox <br/>
(the clues were vague--just like we like) just in case and found the <br/>
box alive &amp; well--with no visitors in over a year!  We truly think <br/>
that 'false missing report' discouraged other letterboxers from <br/>
attempting the quest.  How do you prevent false 'missing' reports on <br/>
such a database?  <br/>
<br/>
On a personal note, we've also had numerous letterboxers report to <br/>
us that our letterboxes were missing--we carved a replacement box, <br/>
hiked out to the hiding spot only to find the letterbox safe and <br/>
sound.  False missing reports are quite common--we've personally <br/>
received several dozen said reports.  We're even guilty of <br/>
such 'false missing reports' for treks we've ventured on ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
As for tracking the status of our myriad 'placed' letterboxes, we do <br/>
it on our own website (either we post it as we visit them, receive <br/>
comments on them or others can post their comments who've sought out <br/>
the letterboxes).  Of course, we retain the right to edit/delete <br/>
such comments if we feel they disclose too much of the <br/>
mystery/solution to the clues.  Perhaps that's something the box <br/>
placer could decide to do on their own?<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm...just some thoughts for discussion.<br/>

vague clues!  LOL<br/>

I originally did have the date and comments, but changed all my <br/>
entries after everyone made a big stink. The only comments on that <br/>
box were that it was wet and we rebagged it. I didn't think that <br/>
could give away anything, but who knows? <br/>
