I considered this long and hard last November when I came across<br/>
Letterboxing via a classroom curriculum. This is how I was introduced<br/>
to this hobby - I spent about several months reading the talk list in<br/>
silence and researching into the hobby on my own. <br/>
<br/>
In March I gathered some things for an environmental "Earth Day -<br/>
Going Green" Fair in the area. I had letterboxing out in the open -<br/>
right next to the local water district and talked to them about their<br/>
trails, they were interested...etc.  <br/>
<br/>
The reason that this hasn't been openely debated as of yet, is because<br/>
it is such a specific hobby - think about it... you have to be willing<br/>
to get wet, dirty, disappointed, and on top of that - be fairly adept<br/>
at map reading if not *at least* car navigation - compass use- web<br/>
search engines - like hiking at least in some small way - love an<br/>
adventure and being outside. <br/>
<br/>
I think it's a unique combination of interests that really defines a<br/>
"Letterboxer"....<br/>
<br/>
In speaking with David Sobel earlier this summer, I concluded that<br/>
"it" (letterboxing) really is a good activity for children. He has<br/>
authored the book (and several others) "Mapmaking with children"... I<br/>
have read through this book and also done several of the mapmaking<br/>
exercises. Although I have no children, I can understand how this<br/>
hobby might spread through other means in addition to the newspress<br/>
articles and TV skits. <br/>
<br/>
There ARE curriculum guides out there that have letterboxing/questing<br/>
as part of the focus... <br/>
<br/>
There ARE nature centers (ie: Maine Audubon) that are experimenting<br/>
with the QUEST idea.<br/>
<br/>
You and everyone else has no control over anyone else and what they<br/>
choose to write/carve/publish/not-publish. As Memlili said, as soon as<br/>
you place a box out there- you relinquish your control over it. You<br/>
either love this, or you spend all your free time (like NO-one I<br/>
know...) checking up on your boxes and tweaking the finer points.<br/>
<br/>
As with many other unique interests, only time will tell how it<br/>
changes, but I like this thought - <br/>
"If you don't like something - change the way you think about it."<br/>
