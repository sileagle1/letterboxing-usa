Do most letterboxers really feel this way? I enjoy geocaching AND <br/>
letterboxing,but I find geocaching much more challenging than <br/>
letterboxing whether the clue is used or not. Most of the thirty or <br/>
so letterboxes I have found have been nice walks in interesting <br/>
places, but pretty straightforward. E.g., "follow the yellow blazed <br/>
trail, turn left at the second bridge, take the trail at 75 degrees <br/>
for 20 paces and look under the fourth tree on the right". <br/>
<br/>
In fact it has been my experience that geocachers who cannot find <br/>
a hybrid cache/letterbox with their GPS often resort to using the <br/>
letterbox clue.<br/>
<br/>
As the writer points out, there are many more caches than boxes. I <br/>
have made it a point to place hybrid caches/letterboxes so that <br/>
letterboxers would have INCREASED opportunities. But why waste the <br/>
time and effort of carving stamps etc. if they are not appreciated <br/>
or if I am "creating letterboxes that few people will enjoy" or <br/>
that "everybody hates". <br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any feedback from letterboxers before I start <br/>
carving again!<br/>

you <br/>

I haven't been at this long but I don't understand what the problem is.  They couple of geo-caches I've found were fun and I love looking for letterboxes.  If someone destroys or trashes someone else's box, of either kind, they're just an anti-social a**hole, correct?  Aren't we all basically having the same fun?  </body></html>

Thank you thank you for your note:<br/>
Please don't stop making your hybrids.<br/>
I wish you lived near me!  <br/>
<br/>
I am a duo-boxer also.  To me they are practically the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
LBNA even states that the clue to the boxes may be just coordinates.<br/>
<br/>
THis little debate will never end ... there will always be those letterboxers who will never touch a geocache and visa versa .<br/>

mine!  But all you folks who replied because you were upset at my <br/>
post, don't kill the messenger!<br/>
<br/>
The poll with 39 votes is pretty straight-forward: Most people don't <br/>
like hybrid boxes.  It's a fact, pure and simple.  I'll grant you <br/>
that some people DO prefer them (12% or so, in fact!), so if you're <br/>
one of those people, by all means, hide them and find them.  However, <br/>
knowing for a FACT that most people do NOT like those boxes, I'd make <br/>
sure the clue included the fact to people who'd prefer not to look <br/>
for them don't inadvertantly do so.  Your audience is people that <br/>
like to find hybrids, so you better make sure the clue reflects the <br/>
fact if you don't want to disappoint a lot of people.  And I don't <br/>
think anyone is out to disappoint others--this hobby is all about <br/>
having fun.<br/>
<br/>
To reply to remarks others have had:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If someone destroys or trashes someone else's box, of either kind,<br/>
&gt; they're just an anti-social a**hole, correct?<br/>
<br/>
I'd tend to agree, but who said anything about destroying or trashing <br/>
someone else's box?  Just because someone doesn't like a particular <br/>
box doesn't mean they're going to destroy it!  I suppose that sort of <br/>
stuff can happen, although I haven't heard of anyone deliberately <br/>
destroying another person's box or geocache because they didn't like <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have made it a point to place hybrid caches/letterboxes so that<br/>
&gt; letterboxers would have INCREASED opportunities. <br/>
<br/>
Strange how that works, huh?  You try to cater to a LARGER audience, <br/>
and fewer people appreciate the effort.  Sometimes I just love irony <br/>
and the psychological reasons for it.<br/>
<br/>
There are letterboxers who will appreciate your efforts, but it's a <br/>
matter of quality vs. quantity.  You can hide more boxes this way, <br/>
but it looks cheap and half-hearted (at least to me) and I generally <br/>
won't go out of my way to find them.  I will if I'm in the area, but <br/>
I won't go out of my way for them.  *shrug*  That's just a personal <br/>
perference, though, and nothing that should upset you or anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
But look at the facts--letterboxers voted overwhelmingly that they <br/>
don't want hybrids.  If you really want to cater to the largest <br/>
possible letterboxing audience, it would be best to keep them <br/>
separate.  You don't have to like it, but that's the way it works.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But why waste the time and effort of carving stamps etc. if they<br/>
&gt; are not appreciated or if I am "creating letterboxes that few<br/>
&gt; people will enjoy" or that "everybody hates". <br/>
<br/>
It's a bummer, I know, but don't kill the messenger.  If it's any <br/>
consolation, though, a few letterboxers WILL appreciate the effort.  <br/>
But most of them won't.  If you decide to hide hybrids, at least you <br/>
should know the facts.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I find geocaching much more challenging than <br/>
&gt; letterboxing whether the clue is used or not. Most of the thirty or <br/>
&gt; so letterboxes I have found have been nice walks in interesting <br/>
&gt; places, but pretty straightforward. E.g., "follow the yellow blazed <br/>
&gt; trail, turn left at the second bridge, take the trail at 75 degrees <br/>
&gt; for 20 paces and look under the fourth tree on the right". <br/>
<br/>
If it's any consolation, I tend to agree.  I prefer much more <br/>
challenging clues than the ones that lead you directly to the <br/>
letterbox.  That's not really a good reason to say geocaching is <br/>
more 'challenging' than letterboxing, though.  It just depends on the <br/>
clue maker.  Many of my favorite letterboxes are my favorites for no <br/>
other reason than especially clever and challenging clues, and I do <br/>
wish more people would create them.  There ARE alternatives to the <br/>
straight-forward clues you mention.<br/>
<br/>
On the other side of the coin, are most of your letterboxing clues <br/>
straight-forward like you describe?  If so, it would be very <br/>
hypocritical to blast letterboxing for those dull, straight-forward <br/>
clues when you're partly responsible for creating them yourself!  <br/>
<br/>
If you want something more challenging, give my Around the World in <br/>
80 Days mystery box a try.  I get LOTS of e-mail from people asking <br/>
for hints about that box!  You don't have to actually go out and find <br/>
the box to enjoy figuring out where it's actually located.  If you're <br/>
ever in Portland, give the Wonderful Tour Series a try.  Reading the <br/>
clues I didn't think those boxes would be especially difficult to <br/>
find, but YIKES!  You want a challenge, give that series a try!<br/>
<br/>
A letterboxing clue is only as good as the effort somebody puts into <br/>
it.  It's astonishing that people will spend so much effort carving <br/>
stamps and finding incredible locations for them, then virtually no <br/>
effort into a clever/imaginative/challenging/whatever clue.  That's <br/>
not a reflexion on letterboxing, though, but more a reflection on the <br/>
letterboxer who hid it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Given the acrimony and rudeness I have seen in letterbox-usa posts <br/>
&gt; over the past few weeks, it would seem that lack of finesse, <br/>
&gt; thoughtlessness, and inconsidate behavior is not limited to <br/>
&gt; geocachers!.<br/>
<br/>
Who said it was limited only to geocachers?  There's always been a <br/>
certain degree of acrimony and rudeness on EVERY board.  If you get a <br/>
group of hundreds of people together, not all of them all be as <br/>
wonderful and thoughtful as myself.  *wink*  =)  But seriously, <br/>
there's bound to me very emtional opinions being thrown back and <br/>
forth in any large group of people.  But keep in mind, most people on <br/>
this board are wonderful people you'd love to invite into your homes, <br/>
even those 'jerks' that would dare to express an opinion contrary to <br/>
your own.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Most of the boxes we hide are letterboxes ... we have just doubled <br/>
&gt; them as a geocache in order to get more visitors.  <br/>
<br/>
There's nothing wrong with that--just keep in mind that not everyone <br/>
will appreciate your efforts.  You mean well--I think most people <br/>
do!  They just don't realize how unpopular hybrids are among most <br/>
letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Some dislike letterboxers as much as some letterboxers dislike them.<br/>
<br/>
I *think* most letterboxers are of the opinion of letting geocachers <br/>
do whatever they want--as long as it doesn't interfere with our <br/>
letterboxing.  =)  I have no ill-well against geocachers, but it <br/>
doesn't mean I want to be a part of it--even in the form of hybrids.<br/>

Jeremy Irish in response to Amanda Briles:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I'm not sure what the motive was for this topic except to raise the ire<br/>
&gt; of combo letterbox/geocachers. "trash" "tramping over the landscape" and<br/>
&gt; "anti-cache" are strong wordings in your original post. Perhaps they do<br/>
&gt; come off as "holier than thou" in email form, and not meant as strongly<br/>
&gt; in your original post.<br/>
<br/>
I believe Jeremy is confusing "Amanda from Seattle", with "Amanda Briles<br/>
The Paisley Orca", as "Amanda from Seattle"'s opinion contained the quoted<br/>
words above ...<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure Jeremy's mistake was honest.<br/>
<br/>
And to refresh, I believe the motive for the topic was an observation <br/>
that a letterbox was possibly replaced by a geocache (followed by other<br/>
possible explanations for what was observed in nature).  Hopefully the<br/>
person with the most information (the one who placed the geocache), will<br/>
respond to the inquiry (but its sort of like going to the island of<br/>
truthtellers and liars, and asking the first native: "are you a <br/>
truthteller"? ...).<br/>
<br/>
As for the rest of the thread, I would say the information content presented<br/>
is already in the archives, but that's just my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as some of you know, most of my posts to this list contain a clue <br/>
(just like there is always "superman" in _Seinfeld_).  I'm at a loss<br/>
this time, tho ...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It's not the creation of letterboxes that's the problem--it's the <br/>
hybrids!  Why do you prefer to stop creating letterboxes instead of <br/>
geocaches?  Create letterboxes instead!  Come to light side!  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, though, it's an easy problem to solve.  When you go on a <br/>
hike, take a letterbox AND a geocache to hide.  Why not?  It takes <br/>
maybe one extra minute to whip together a box specifically for the <br/>
letterbox--you've already been making clues and carving stamps, so <br/>
it's not like you'll be adding MORE time.  Stick it in another box.  <br/>
Heck, hide them in the same tree!  I've seen geocaches and <br/>
letterboxes live harmoniously in the same tree before!<br/>
<br/>
A person can enjoy both letterboxing and geocaching without chasing <br/>
hybrids.  The only reason for the two hobbies to overlap as hybrids <br/>
(as far as I can tell) is because someone is too lazy to put the <br/>
stuff into two different containers.<br/>
<br/>
So don't stop hiding letterboxes--just put the stamp and the notebook <br/>
in a different container!  Letterboxers will be happy.  Geocachers I <br/>
don't think really care one way or another.  (Most don't seem to even <br/>
know what letterboxing is in the first place, which is why hybrids <br/>
have stamps that go missing all the time.)  Everyone's happy, and all <br/>
you're out is maybe one minute of your time and a cheap, Ziplock <br/>
container or something.  =)<br/>

<br/>
*hehe*  I tend to agree that online surveys are a joke, but have you <br/>
got a better method?  And assuming a random assortment of people from <br/>
this board had voted on it before the issue blew up on the talk list, <br/>
I suspect there's some degree of validity to it.<br/>
<br/>
But from the minute I made a reference to it, I wouldn't take any <br/>
additions to it worth a grain of salt, because people like you might <br/>
turn the tide of the poll in a day just to make a point.  The point <br/>
would have been better made if you turned the tide BEFORE I pointed <br/>
the poll out.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody had an agenda to screw around with the poll until after I <br/>
brought it up to the table, so I suspect while it's not <br/>
scientifically highly accurate, it's a pretty good sentiment about <br/>
the general consensus.  But you only have to talk to a few <br/>
letterboxers to figure that out without a poll.<br/>
<br/>
For what it's worth, when I started letterboxing, I didn't see the <br/>
harm in having hybrids.  Why NOT?!  What do I care who goes looking <br/>
for my letterboxes?  The only reason I didn't was because I didn't <br/>
have a GPS.  Ah, I was certainly nieve in my beginning days.  =)  <br/>
Anyhow, after a little letterboxing experience (and finding a couple <br/>
of geocaches as well), it's really not in the best interest of a <br/>
letterbox.  And, in fact, it's not even really necessary since it's <br/>
just as easy to hide a geocache and letterbox in separate containers.<br/>

I regret that this has driven you away from a fun hobby.  Hopefully we can all get along a little better and not let that happen again.<br/>
