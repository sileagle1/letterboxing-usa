                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know, Brian, we've been friends for a long time but I'm done! How<br/>
can you stand there and point the finger at me as the culprit in this<br/>
PZ Kut theft? I'm sick and tired of being a goody two shoes while<br/>
bearing all the ill will that you veterans send my way. In the last<br/>
month, I've been accused of perpetuating the K-Martha joke, being an<br/>
elitist (Yes - I said the "E" word!) and was even blamed for the<br/>
latest round of exorbitant gas prices on an AQ post!<br/>
<br/>
Peperazzi, huh? I've worked hard on our blog, which, by the way, is an<br/>
online letterboxing newspaper, filled with truths not garbage like<br/>
some sleazy supermarket tabloid! How can you even equate my surname<br/>
with those despicable reporters that hound Hollywood stars and<br/>
beautiful people? Plus - I can't think of a single letterboxer who<br/>
even resembles a screen star or a beautiful person. Have you guys<br/>
looked in the mirror lately? What a sad bunch of losers you really<br/>
are. Yeah, I said LOSERS! Try to be nice all the time and what does it<br/>
get you? Accused of taking some karaoke-singing, crying left coater's<br/>
carving media. Give me a break! You people really need a life!<br/>
<br/>
OK - I lied. I wasn't home dealing with the hot water heater problem<br/>
like I stated earlier. That was handled by Sue since I was out of the<br/>
country. Sure - you saw me at PDX being hassled by the airport<br/>
gendarmes, but that wasn't white PZ Kut that was protruding from my<br/>
bags - it was white letterboxing band material!<br/>
<br/>
I'm sick of just being just a letterboxer and putting time into a<br/>
website that brings us no profit and only grief from people like you.<br/>
Since our "Get out there &amp; box" letterboxing bands have been selling<br/>
off the shelves, I pondered a method to save some money in their<br/>
production so Sue &amp; I would yield a larger profit and be able to<br/>
retire to the woods of VT - away from the likes of you!<br/>
<br/>
Disguising my voice, I called our supplier of the boxing bands and<br/>
acted like a shipping agent in charge of their raw material rubber.<br/>
After they fell for my ruse, they rolled over like someone begging for<br/>
my personal traveler and spilled the name of the manufacturing<br/>
facility in Saiphora, Japan. So, my dragon-breathed friend, you were<br/>
not the only US letterboxer trying to make their fortune in the Land<br/>
of the Rising Sun. You better watch yourself, Brian. I know you now<br/>
live in Soprano-land. All I have to do is make one phone call to my<br/>
cousin Benny Two Fingers and you'll be singing sotto falsetto, if you<br/>
know what I mean!<br/>
<br/>
My alibi? Just talk to Wes Garrison. I took the boxing band material,<br/>
after an exhausting 2 hour delay at the airport showing all of our<br/>
importing paperwork to prove this was material for manufacturing wrist<br/>
bands, to Kansas. Yes - that's right, Kansas. Why? That's where the<br/>
manufacturer of our wrist bands has their facility and is where we<br/>
brought the rubber so they could speed up the manufacturing process.<br/>
With the upcoming bevy of gatherings, we wanted to make the most of a<br/>
captive bunch of newbies who, like lambs to the slaughter, wave their<br/>
$5 bills at us to purchase these cheap little sorry bands that we pay<br/>
10 cents for - or did! With our latest trip to Japan - the bands now<br/>
cost us one stinking penny. How's that for profit? Vermont and<br/>
retirement here we come!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While there, I knocked on Wes' door and asked if he and his lovely<br/>
wife would like to go to dinner with me. Wes has helped us out over<br/>
the years on our website and I felt it was time to repay our debt,<br/>
being in town and all. We had a wonderful sushi dinner at Johnny's<br/>
Sushi House in Topeka on the night in question. If you need further<br/>
proof, I will gladly fax my dated American Express receipt for that<br/>
night that the actual PZ Kut disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
Find another victim, Brian - I'm innocent. <br/>
<br/>
Oh - and have a good life. I hear there's an opening for a sotto<br/>
falsetto in the New Jersey Women's Choir.<br/>
<br/>
Mark<br/>
<br/>
PS. DON't have fun and DON't get out and box. Losers!<br/>
<br/>
PPS. I am still convinced that Don is the culprit. I saw him lurking<br/>
in a dark corner at PDX and he was alone. That would explain how those<br/>
boxes got planted in that far away place since Gwen took care of that<br/>
portion of their alibi. Who better than someone with all the proper<br/>
tools and an encyclopedic knowledge of security alarms? <br/>

<br/>
Well it is time to set all our my accusers straight. As I stated <br/>
before I have an iron clad alibi.<br/>
 I really can't believe that such friends I have. Just keep on pushing <br/>
my name out there just so you can divert attention off of yourselves.  <br/>
What a bunch of ingrates. I try to keep all of those newboxers <br/>
informed on the newboxer list,and no one really appreciates the <br/>
control I keep over my sometimes nasty personality. Well to heck with <br/>
you Mark, and you Barefoot Lucy you can take your foot over to the <br/>
fetisher Mr. Stamper. Red shoes indeed.<br/>
 Now there is really some justification for Der Mad Stampers loss. Has <br/>
there ever been anyone that carries boxes of stamps when he stamps in <br/>
a logbook? Yep, Ol' Mr.Stamper. Good heavens he can fill up a microbox <br/>
log faster than anyone around. I think that he probably ticked off <br/>
some other placer that just got tired of seeing view after view after <br/>
view of Alfred E Newman in their logbook and they just wanted him to <br/>
stop carving.<br/>
<br/>
In any case here is my last post on my alibi.<br/>
<br/>
Yes we were in San Diego the entire week around the time of the theft.<br/>
I spent the early afternoon on the day of the theft at the Mira Mar <br/>
shooting range. My 5 stand scores were 19, 22, 23, and 23. The Trapper <br/>
would surely remember me for the huge $4 tip I gave him.<br/>
 On the night in question Gwen &amp; I were out to dinner with some <br/>
of "HER" relatives in Poway. There were a couple of birthdays being <br/>
celebrated. One being one of her relatives and the other was mine. Now <br/>
I see these folks very seldom and while they are nice folks, they <br/>
aren't "MY" relatives. Enuff said? It really wasn't "MY" idea to go <br/>
out to dinner with them, but this is one of those little things <br/>
spouses do regardless if it is your birthday or not.<br/>
 Well as I recall the chicken ceasar salad went well with several San <br/>
Adams (Der Mad Stamper has now reawakened and perked up his ears)and <br/>
we left just a few hours prior to the theft which made it impossible <br/>
for us to be envolved. Gwen drove back to our trailer. <br/>
 So I have many eye witnesses for the early evening, later evening, <br/>
posted records of our three planted letterboxes, logbook entries for <br/>
those we found (yes we both signed our names), and I even have the <br/>
birthday card. OOps I might have tossed it for lack of sentimentality. <br/>
We were pulling our trailer to and fro so there will be many over <br/>
priced gas tickets that we can produce if necessary. You even have <br/>
seen Gwen's statement and while some of my background is gray, she on <br/>
the otherhand was one of those goody goodies in school, and would <br/>
never tell an untruth.<br/>
<br/>
But the most important thing I can say about my being not guilty is <br/>
that I'm buying the next round for Der Mad Stamper the next time I see <br/>
him. What say you Mr. Stamper?<br/>

I resemble Mr Pepe remarks but his words are true.....I do play a <br/>
different game yet our goals are the same!<br/>
<br/>
and I note that there was no hint of a denial regarding the <br/>
involvement with DMS's medium!!!<br/>
<br/>
I would urge caution when dealing with these shady <br/>
characters "Milady" as their intentions are less than honourable!<br/>

I am sure you realize that when I spoke about not knowing a beautiful letterboxer that you were a shining exception to the rule, along with my lovely wife, Sue. At no time did I ever mean to include you or Sue in those generalizations. After all, those words I whispered in your shell-like ear at that mysterious rendezvous in Rhode Island were all true.<br/>
<br/>
As far as this new mouse character, I fear he is up to no good; trying to win your heart. Did you know that a mouse can fit into a hole the size of a pencil's width? They have no backbone, I've read. That is not what you seek in a man - or a letterboxer - for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
This mouse is a crafty one - moor or less. We have seen him in action. He even tried to lure poor Rubaduc away from us at one point. And we all know what an innocent person the Duc is. He tried to lure her with a certain well-known dessert whose name left Rubaduc speechless. <br/>
<br/>
We want to warn our letterboxing friends. This is a sly and cunning mouse.<br/>

Why Mark, how sweet. You're jealous! This dear Annonymous one has only<br/>
been kind to her Ladyship yet I cannot say the same for you. Sadly I<br/>
feel that I must be wary of your intentions.<br/>
