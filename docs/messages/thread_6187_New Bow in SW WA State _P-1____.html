<br/>
This is the first box placed by DrFruit &amp; AnnaGun.  We just <br/>
learned about letterboxing - a great way to combine creativity &amp; <br/>
exercise!<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox Name:  Battle Ground Lake #2<br/>
State:  Washington<br/>
Region:  Southwest (same as Vancouver, USA)<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Easy<br/>
Hike:  Easy<br/>
<br/>
Our first find was BG Lake, by Der Mad Stamper.  Since this <br/>
beautiful park is so close to our home, we decided to place our <br/>
first box here as well.  You may want to find his box first, and then <br/>
continue around the lake to ours - we have written the directions <br/>
both ways.<br/>
<br/>
Directions from BG Lake box, placed by Der Mad Stamper:<br/>
<br/>
After finding his letterbox, return back along the horse trail until <br/>
you rejoin the Upper Rim hiking trail again.  Continue south <br/>
(counterclockwise) around the lake, enjoying the beautiful <br/>
woods.  When you are SE of the lake, you will come to an <br/>
intersection of several trails:  head down to the Lake.  You will <br/>
notice soon that a concrete monster has left droppings along <br/>
this trail - he even numbered them!  When you see the HUGE <br/>
cedar tree next to the path on your left, pace downhill the number <br/>
of the members of the Fellowship (=Ringwraiths).  You should <br/>
find our box behind a rock, covered by some decayed wood.<br/>
<br/>
Directions from the maain parking lot:<br/>
<br/>
Follow the paved driveway down to the lake, boat launch, &amp; <br/>
fishing dock.  You will find several paths near the water heading <br/>
south (clockwise) around the lake.  Take any of them - they will <br/>
merge into one.  After a short hike, you can sit on a bench next to <br/>
concrete dropping #12.  Head up toward the Upper Rim Trail, <br/>
and watch out for the big cedar tree (on your right).  Pace back <br/>
down as above to find our box.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for getting us started, Karl!<br/>
