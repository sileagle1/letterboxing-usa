The CO is new. They've already started off on a bad foot with poor coordinates, didn't post the hours of the park, then on top of it blantantly removed your letterbox and assumed his trumped yours because he has an official gc sticker.

I saw one similar message in a log book in Washington,  and wonder what makes a person think they own a spot or can take over a spot.  You could play games like "take my box then I'll go back and take yours", but what's the point or fun in that?<br/>

<br/>
There are two points that I want to make...<br/>
<br/>
1) The cache owner states that he *did* write to the box owner, and told him that the box was damaged.  I assume that this is correct.  In reading his comments, he had not intended to "take over" the spot.  His hope was that both the cache and the box could share the same spot; this is why he mentions the geocaching sticker; it would identify the cache as the cache; the other box is *not* the cache.  He has since decided that it is better if the two things don't share the same space.  To be honest, I find his original thinking to be refreshingly disarming.  It is sad fact that the vast majority of humans refuse to act in a way that would make his hope a reality.<br/>
<br/>
2) Letterboxers are not perfect.  I have Found two boxes hidden within a couple of feet of geocaches *that were there first*.  In one case, the box owner just didn't look hard enough at the spot, and was quick to move the box when I told him/her about it.  In the other case, the boxer refused to move the offending box, then, when the stamp was taken as swag, s/he broke the geocache in a fit of pique.  It is incumbent upon each of us (boxers, cachers and others) to make a good effort to avoid getting in the way of other peoples' games, and to react quickly and positively when we still goof.<br/>
<br/>
I will say this much; being an active geocacher sure makes it a lot easier to be a letterboxer.  Having access to all that information is a real bonus.<br/>

I assumed that the stamp was still in the damaged box and that the geocacher had removed the box with the stamp and did not intend to share the spot. Well you know what they say about assuming something...doh .<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think the stamp survived and log was wet.  The Geocacher emailed me back saying they would return my box to its location this weekend and move their Geocache, so then I can fix my box.  Hopefully Geocachers won't continue to go to that spot and mistake my box for the cache since the stamp would eventually be taken by mistake.  That is the main reason letterboxes and geocaches can't occupy the same spot.  It is too bad that Geocaching involves taking something from the cache, otherwise the two hobbies could co-exist better.  Thanks for help resolving this issue.<br/>

&gt; Thanks Jim for more of the story. I'm glad that the new CO was so easy to deal with. I'm wondering how damaged the letterbox is. Silver Eagle, did the geocacher tell you whether the handcarved stamp survived?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I assumed that the stamp was still in the damaged box and that the geocacher had removed the box with the stamp and did not intend to share the spot. Well you know what they say about assuming something...doh .<br/>

Man I had to go read the notes on that geocache....some really rude people...not all of us are like that!  I respect any boxes or caches that make it 3 years in the wild. I hope mine will...have had to replace geocaches but so far none of my letterboxes. Glad you all set him straight.<br/>
