Roosevelt Island box near the rocks with the view of Key Bridge.<br/>
<br/>
I saw in an office a framed b&amp;w photo that clearly showed some civil <br/>
war soldiers standing around that very rock with the very same view <br/>
of Key bridge (or its predecessor).  <br/>
<br/>
Was my first thought, "Wow, letterboxers"?<br/>
