                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not knowing that the sun was going to be coming out (and still not quite <br/>
believing it when I see it!) Be and Ma, under the watchful eye of Na, of <br/>
course,(sounds like an Egyptian deity or something) headed off in the <br/>
drizzle to the playground at the Grange.<br/>
<br/>
We brought two big towels to wipe off the slides and all the other <br/>
equipment, but, somehow both kids ended up with very wet bottoms and very <br/>
big smiles on their faces!  "We're wet and dirty and we love it" they <br/>
remarked, mimicking a line from the Fairly Odd Parents (in that episode the <br/>
main characters were disguised as fish and swimming around in a toilet bowl, <br/>
so I should consider myself lucky!...)<br/>
<br/>
After the required amount of bribery playground time was reached (a very <br/>
tricky determination -- too much playground time and they are too tired and <br/>
therefore whiney, too little playground time and they are extremely <br/>
reluctant to leave and therefore whiney...  As a parent, you must judge the <br/>
moment juuuuuuuust right!) we donned the pack, slathered on the bug spray <br/>
and pulled out our clues.<br/>
<br/>
We were very intrigued by this set of clues because Rich had the very cool <br/>
idea of using photographs to lead to the box in lieu of words!  Pretty neat! <br/>
  We followed the pics (17 in all, #6 being the group of trees behind which <br/>
the kids used to pee 'cause the porto potty was really stinky at that time) <br/>
into the woods!  We got to the fence with little problem, viewing two homes, <br/>
neither of which was ours, but I can tell you which of the two I would <br/>
choose if I had to....<br/>
<br/>
Be was a trooper.  Miss Ma was a little sensitive having decided that all <br/>
encounters with anything remotely "prickly" be announced with shrill <br/>
screams.  I am sad to announce that even the poor little holly trees have <br/>
been unjustly placed in this category (sorry Mary, that eliminates a bunch <br/>
of clues to your boxes!)<br/>
<br/>
The trees were wet, the plants were wet, the long grasses and ivy were wet.  <br/>
Drip, drip in the woods.  At the fence, perhaps under the pressure of <br/>
nature's "Chinese water torture" Mom neglected to carefully study the photo <br/>
and sent us following the fence down the wrong way.  It was a long fence.  <br/>
Having realized our error, we retraced our steps, carrying Miss Ma back over <br/>
the many holly trees and other perilous vegetation, until we found the logs <br/>
at the end.<br/>
<br/>
It was Miss Ma's turn to actually "find" the box.  Now, normally, I scout a <br/>
little ahead, hoping to see the box and gently point her in the right <br/>
direction.  But, that afternoon -- she found it before anyone else all on <br/>
her own!  You go girl!  What fooled me where the sticks on top.  In the <br/>
photo they look nice and light gray.  In reality, they were a deep brown, <br/>
saturated from the weeks of rain.<br/>
<br/>
We were even happier to discover that we were the first ones to find this <br/>
box (happy dance in place 'cause the logs were slippery!).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Rich for this fun and innovative set of clues!!  BeMa<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  I have to mention that some of the thousand words these photos are <br/>
worth have to include the names of the people who contributed money to <br/>
refurbish this playground.  It is a lot of fun to read the names of <br/>
playmates and their folks.  It is even a comforting moment of reflection to <br/>
recognize those memorialized on benches etc.  That is what it feels like to <br/>
be part of a community.<br/>
