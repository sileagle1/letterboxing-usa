                    <div class="plaintext-content">Specific questions about Atlas Quest should be directed to me.  =)  <br/>
I've been on vacation and out of touch for the last several days, and <br/>
it's easy for me to miss a message on the talk list.  If it wasn't <br/>
for the great title, I'd have missed it completely!  (There's over <br/>
250 new message to wade through!)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have tried the contact us and received a reply but it was not<br/>
&gt; helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I do my best!  Really!  But as much as my reply may not have been as <br/>
helpful as you wanted, nobody else can fix these issues.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Why would one box and not the other 41 record-not all one series.<br/>
&gt; As well as 7 HH that won't record!<br/>
<br/>
Could you e-mail (no reason to clog up this list) me the names of <br/>
some boxes you want to record as a find so I can try it too?  <br/>
Sometimes, it helps to figure out a problem if I can recreate it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have also noticed that someone-not Warrior Woman-is claiming to<br/>
&gt; have planted the Blade Runner Series in Westerly, RI.<br/>
<br/>
I can find no record of this series on Atlas Quest.  Presumably, the <br/>
person who added it has deleted it.<br/>
<br/>
Any boxes that are listed without the owner's permission will be <br/>
deleted.  I cannot personally verify every letterbox that is entered, <br/>
so it's up to people like you to keep them honest.  =)  If you see <br/>
boxes listed that should not be, let me know.  I'll investigate and <br/>
either delete the box if it shouldn't be listed, or leave it if the <br/>
author of the box okays it.  Atlas Quest assumes any box you list was <br/>
created by the person who entered it--which may not be the case for <br/>
adopted boxes, so sometimes you might see a mismatched name but it's <br/>
still okay.  (For the record, the website DOES distinguish between <br/>
the author of a letterbox and the owner of a letterbox, and I can <br/>
manually change one or the other as necessary.  I'm working on an <br/>
interface so users can do that themselves, however.  So for those of <br/>
you who have adopted boxes listed on AQ, let me know and I can change <br/>
the author to the proper person--or to nobody at all if the user <br/>
doesn't have an account.)<br/>
<br/>
Hope I've helped a bit more this time, but if not, please e-mail me.  <br/>
There's not much anyone else can do to help, as I'm the sole creator <br/>
of the website.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>
