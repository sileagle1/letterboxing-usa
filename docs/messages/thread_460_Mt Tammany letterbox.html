It would not be the first, we've had a few other letterboxes that were<br/>
likely stolen.  The only way to verify for sure though is to to have<br/>
Marty Chamberlain check on it.  Since the clues for the Tammany box<br/>
are a bit involved I would recommend that you not automatically<br/>
assume you have found the spot.  I was sure I had found the spot<br/>
for the Multnomah Falls box in Oregon but I did not and later Mitch<br/>
Klink, the placer of the box verified for me that I had missed it<br/>
because I was trying to find the bearing from within the park instead<br/>
of by the parking lot outside the park.  So, even when bearings are<br/>
involved there can be some amibiguity.<br/>

&gt; for magnetic declination)? <br/>
<br/>
A harder question (for me anyway) is what is a pace? :-)<br/>
<br/>
I have attempted to clarify both questions with boilerplate <br/>
language on all of my clues:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;          NOTE 4:  [...] All bearings magnetic unless otherwise<br/>
&gt;          noted. A pace is a long stride counted on a footfall of <br/>
&gt;          either foot, i.e. two paces are counted each time<br/>
&gt;          the right foot hits the ground.<br/>
<br/>
At least for my clues, hope that clarifies.  As for when this information<br/>
is not specified in a clue, I assume magnetic bearings because declination<br/>
varies with location, and I'm too lazy to look it up unless the clue <br/>
explicitly specifies true bearings (if I feel I need to, I assume a decl<br/>
of 15 deg, which seems close enough for use in the lower 48 -- from my<br/>
experience, you can generally be within 10 degrees of a bearing and still<br/>
hit the box or next clue leg).  I use the magnetic assumption because it is<br/>
likely that the clue writer read the bearing right off of the compass<br/>
after writing that leg of the clue (at least that is how I do it).<br/>
<br/>
I find pacing much more difficult to handle in the field.  I have to<br/>
guess is it one or two paces each time the right foot hits the<br/>
ground, is it a long or normal stride, is it a tall or short person,<br/>
etc.  On this one, I hope the hider used a pace calibration leg in<br/>
their clue; when they do not, I try all of the above combinations<br/>
and still don't hit it sometimes :-)  I have found variations of<br/>
50% or more in pace counts between me and the hider, and when you <br/>
start talking about 100 paces, turn left, then 200 paces, etc, the<br/>
error can add up (especially if there is intervening vegatation and<br/>
other forest clutter/terrain), and can be quite a challenge.<br/>

Boy, don't I know it.  Can't wait to have a conversation with you in person about E. Shore :-) <br/>
<br/>
I agree with randy totally about the assumption that all bearings are magnetic unless otherwise specified.  It gets way too complicated otherwise, esp. for kids.<br/>

&gt;  other forest clutter/terrain), and can be quite a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Most people that I've observed pacing a distance seem to use a 3-foot<br/>
measure, which I always found a bit odd. A short person has to really<br/>
stretch to do this, and I feel very inaccurate.<br/>
<br/>
I am tall, but I've found that a 2 1/2 pace is an easy saunter, able to<br/>
be corrected by dead-reckoning when going around/over obstacles, etc.<br/>
And, the math is easy - every left (or right) foot equals 5 feet.<br/>
<br/>
To get the "calibration" right, I practice from time to time with a<br/>
known distance (say, 1 or 2 hundred feet). Its worth the effort. <br/>
<br/>
However, rather than feet (excepting Prayaer ROck, which goes over some<br/>
rough spots), I use "paces" in the clue, being 2 1/2' paces. <br/>
<br/>
This is in the "for what its worth" catagory - I'm certainly not<br/>
advocating any hard-and-fast rule.  But, I'm glad it was brought up.<br/>
<br/>
I also think magnetic bearings make more sense, and I try to be clear<br/>
about using them.  Declination can be east or west, depending on<br/>
location, and, frankly, having to think it thru is just one more chance<br/>
for an error.<br/>
