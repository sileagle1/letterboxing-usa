                    <html><body>The Bear Claw Hitchhiker has made its way across the USA from Washington to Connecticut this week! Â However, not by traditional means.... the hitchhiker was sent via snail mail to help aleviate the overcrowding of hitchhikers in the Pacific Northwest, and to help the hitchhiker starved letterboxers in the Northeast.
<br/>
<br/>A Special THANK YOU to Amanda in Seattle, who was very thoughtful to send me the hitchhiker!
<br/>
<br/>The Bear Claw should be out on the trail sometime this weekend, if the snow has receded in southern CT.
<br/>
<br/>Happy Trails everyone!
