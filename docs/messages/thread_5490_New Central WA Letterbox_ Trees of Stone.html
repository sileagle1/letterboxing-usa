nearest town: Vantage, WA, USA<br/>
county: Klikittat (don't hold me to that spelling)<br/>
<br/>
 From I-90, east or west bound, take the Vantage exit.  Follow Highway <br/>
10 (main road) through town to the Ginkgo Petrified Forest State Park. <br/>
Stop at the Interpretive Visitor Center and pay a dollar to learn all <br/>
about why you should be really impressed on the trails, and to talk to <br/>
the lady behind the counter who is a font of information on the ice age <br/>
and on the native american petroglyphs behind the building.  For a <br/>
quarter, you can pick up a map of the interpretive trails, as well, <br/>
which I'd highly recommend.  It gets a little confusing out there.<br/>
<br/>
 From there, load up on water and head the 2 miles north to the parking <br/>
lot for the interpretive trailhead.  (There's only one trailhead, you <br/>
can't miss it.)  Follow it south, past the ranger station and exhibits <br/>
1, 2, and 3.  Continue on straight before taking a sharp left and going <br/>
up a massive hill.  Stay on this trail until you hit a "Y" in the road, <br/>
and take the right fork, heading up even further.  Over the top of the <br/>
hill is an unnumbered display on your right of a petrified redwood.<br/>
<br/>
Go off the path and around to the top side of the redwood display. <br/>
Hidden in the sagebrush bush just above the display, under a pile of <br/>
rocks, is the letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
Please make sure to cover the box -completely- with rocks when you're <br/>
done, or it can be easily seen in this desert wilderness.  Also, please <br/>
please PLEASE be VERY careful when reaching in -- there are Western <br/>
Rattlesnakes all over this area, and it's a long way down the hill if <br/>
you get bitten.  Poke the rocks first and listen for a rattle before <br/>
reaching near them.<br/>
<br/>
This trail gains about 300 feet of elevation over 3 miles round trip, <br/>
and is quite suitable for older children.<br/>
<br/>
If you continue on the trail to the north (veering to the west), you'll <br/>
be able to see the rest of the displays, some of which are pretty <br/>
interesting.  This path will also lead you back around the parking lot, <br/>
past a Western Meadowlark nesting ground.<br/>
<br/>
(I'm planning on coming back here to put in a series of boxes, one near <br/>
each display, if I can.  This is because I'm an overachiever and I have <br/>
to make up for the fact that I proceeded to mis-carve the lettering on <br/>
this stamp so that it's in reverse, since I carved it in the parking <br/>
lot.  *sigh*)<br/>
