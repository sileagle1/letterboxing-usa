Turtle and I went together on a search. We went back to Squirrels <br/>
Mystery Box and STILL came up empty handed. It wasn't a total loss as <br/>
I encountered another Agkistrodon Contortrix, yes that's right! <br/>
Another one! Also got stung on the arms and legs by Urtica Dioica. <br/>
What a pain in the....!  For those that don't know what I'm talking <br/>
about; The first was a copperhead snake and the second were those <br/>
bleeping stinging nettles. We did as Squirrel suggested and had a <br/>
nice visit with the new Lockmaster. She said to be vary carefull of <br/>
the copperheads, as it was breeding time and for some unusual reason <br/>
this year the little devils were real aggressive.<br/>
    We then went to find two more mystery boxes. This would be the <br/>
first time we all used our homemade stamps. <br/>
     It looks like my back pack is turning into a walkabout pharmacy. <br/>
I have Epi-pen, Benadryl, Benadryl cream, baking soda, bandaids, <br/>
anticeptics, ice/hot packs and on and on. Geesh! Now I need a snake <br/>
bite kit too! <br/>
     I have to agree with Springchick NOTHING is going to stop me!  <br/>
Well maybe a bear. Haven't seen one yet. Since starting this hobby I <br/>
must say I've learned alot. I'm having a fun time too!<br/>
     Tomorrow I'm off to do some serious hunting. The End<br/>
