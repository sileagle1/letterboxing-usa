                    <div class="plaintext-content">We found this box yesterday and it was, as Uncle Mikey reported back <br/>
in September, a waterlogged mess with a puddle of goo for a <br/>
logbook.  According to a post in the book, the contets of the box <br/>
may have been soaking in water for over a year.  Ewwwwwww!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we hated to see Squirrel's work in such sad shape, so we <br/>
took the box home, dried out any recognizable stamped pages of the <br/>
logbook, and replaced the contents with a new logbook in a new box.  <br/>
We plan to put the new box back in its hiding spot later this <br/>
afternoon, so come out after today to find Hal and his Magic <br/>
Mushroom!<br/>
<br/>
Mama Frog, and the rest of the Forest Frog Family<br/>
