The Island Fox Letterbox<br/>
(Two Harbors, California)<br/>
<br/>
There once was a little Island Fox that was born on an island full of <br/>
change. This island once had only fox, lizards, snakes and birds.  Now <br/>
it was an island full of people, buffalo, pigs, goats and invasive <br/>
feral cats.  Feral cats are bigger than the little fox and are more <br/>
aggressive hunters.  Feral cats and pet dogs passed distemper to the <br/>
fox family and almost everyone was gone now.  She was a lonely and <br/>
curious little fox and she decided to visit town.<br/>
<br/>
Little fox started at Doug's Harbor Reef Saloon patio bar where she <br/>
had a Buffalo Milk drink to muster her strength.  Sitting there, she <br/>
realized that this is not where a little fox should be so she left <br/>
town.  She walked out of the patio bar, past the restrooms and towards <br/>
Catalina Harbor. The little fox walked a path past the little school <br/>
and the old barracks, now called the Isthmus Yacht Club, and along an <br/>
oiled dirt road.  When she "left" the pavement, she headed towards the <br/>
palm tree side of the backside harbor called Catalina Harbor.  The <br/>
other side of the harbor was lined only with eucalyptus trees along <br/>
the oiled dirt road.<br/>
<br/>
The little Island Fox followed that palm tree lined road past a yacht <br/>
club facility and then she spied something. Out in the distance, she <br/>
could see two benches on an over look. She headed on toward those <br/>
benches. When she reached a branch in the road at the California Yacht <br/>
Club facility, she decided to go up and "left" the trail to reach the <br/>
benches. The first bench was old and woody but the other was fine and <br/>
newer and dedicated to someone from the 4th of July Yacht Club. The <br/>
little fox sat down and had a cold drink from her knapsack.<br/>
<br/>
It was a windy view from where she sat, and as little fox looked out <br/>
over the great Pacific Ocean she decided to sail to Hawaii to look for <br/>
more fox.  When she stood up from the bench she spied a survey marker <br/>
down about twenty feet and towards the inlet, marked DY3019 HARBOR <br/>
LAT=N331540 LON=W1183020.  Little fox decided to leave a little <br/>
reminder of herself on the island before heading for Hawaii.<br/>
<br/>
About 200 man-sized paces at 100 degrees from the marker will take you <br/>
up a single track trail close to the edge of a landslip.  Along the <br/>
way, veer to the inland trail only a wee bit. There, as you can see <br/>
even from the bench, are large fire-burned posts marking what is left <br/>
of a fence.  At the base of the largest post, held down by old wire <br/>
fence and grass is her mark!  Beware of snakes and cactus!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the view and donate some love to the fox foundations below!<br/>
