&gt;&gt; I would like to know who tipped them as you put it. I did not give my<br/>

&gt;&gt; I just let it go to the Smithsonian. I DO NOT BELIEVE IN ANY ONE WITH<br/>
&gt;&gt; FINANCIAL INTERESTS BEING INVOLVED WITH BOXING<br/>

&gt;Adrian is referring to the Somerset Studio article mentioned by Sheila<br/>
&gt;Cunningham recently.  Do we know that they excerpted anything but<br/>
&gt;general letterboxing info?  And do we know that their interest is<br/>
&gt;anything but a general interest in letterboxing?  They were likely just<br/>
&gt;doing us a favor -- to help the hobby get exposure, generate interest<br/>
&gt;and the like.  That's my take on it.<br/>
I've seen the article in Somerset magazine and it's basically a shorter<br/>
version of the article that appeared in Smithsonian.  There are some lovely<br/>
photos of the moors and also of Adrian and Tegan.  How the business end of<br/>
it worked, I have no idea.  Would a small magazine pay Smithsonian for the<br/>
privilege of a reprint?  I don't know, but I was glad to see the hobby get<br/>
more exposure before I realized that it might bug Adrian.<br/>
<br/>
On another topic, the Duck Creek letterbox #2 has been hidden as per clue<br/>
#2 dictates--I got everything dried out or replaced and it's in hiding once<br/>
again.  Box #3 is ready to go, but I wasn't all that happy with the<br/>
locations I visited yesterday so I'm not sure when it will be out there.<br/>
But ya'll will be the first to know!!<br/>

Want to buy a book?  I'm trying to make a life-long dream come true and<br/>
open a bookshop.  It's tiny, but it grows now and then.  Come see!<br/>
