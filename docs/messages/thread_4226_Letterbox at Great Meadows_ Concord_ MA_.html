<br/>
    This letterbox was placed by Walden Run with a very clear clue sheet,<br/>
yet, my hubbie and I failed to find it yesterday.  We checked all the<br/>
multi-branched trees in the area, and didn't find it.  This area, as Walden<br/>
Run mentions, could be under water in the spring.  Also, we noted that there<br/>
were poison ivy vines growing up some of the trees.<br/>
<br/>
    Since this one was placed recently, it seems unlikely that is has<br/>
disappeared, so I will go back there again.  Anyone else been there?<br/>
<br/>
