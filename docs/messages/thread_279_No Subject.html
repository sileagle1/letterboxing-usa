	To get an overview, take a look at www.letterboxing.org and browse<br/>
through the site.  How did you find the email group?  Where are you?  My<br/>
husband, Erik, and I are up in Vermont.   The most common way for people<br/>
to get involved is to take some clues off the web page, find a box and<br/>
brag about the experience on the e-group.  We also make and hide<br/>
letterboxes and post them to the site (you don't need to be a techie, we<br/>
have some great volunteers).<br/>
<br/>
We have a few simple guidelines such as:<br/>
	No politics, no profanity, no religion, no chain letters, no<br/>
solicitations, no personal profits from letterboxing.  We admire<br/>
innovation, consensus building, puns, art, puzzles, supportive<br/>
criticism, helpful suggestions, sharing triumphs and, sometimes,<br/>
tragedies like lost boxes.  We all love Mother Nature and we come from<br/>
all kinds of backgrounds.  Some boxers participate regularly and some,<br/>
alas, are heard from infrequesntly.<br/>
<br/>
	Just join in, we welcome you!<br/>

Gary,<br/>
	Thanks for your timely reply.  I have visited www.leterboxing.org and the <br/>
page for clues.  Although I clicked New Jersey and New York, I did not <br/>
receive a response.  I have just addressed an e-mail to both NY and NJ <br/>
which I believe will be answered by someone in this area.<br/>
<br/>
	Thanks for your input.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hiya: here are some clues for Liberty park in NJ. They sound a little<br/>
hard for kids though. Maybe, if there is nothing close to you, you<br/>
could sneak out a day or two early, and plant a box in a nearby park<br/>
yourself. Then, you'd be sure to "find" it and keep the kids<br/>
interested!  Jay<br/>

<br/>
Well, here's the clues to my first box.  I know the whole rhyming thing<br/>
is a little corny, but as my mom always said, it's original too :) Oh,<br/>
and your hunt begins at Liberty State Park.(14B of the NJ Turnpike ) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where once there were tales of hardship and woe,  <br/>
A hunt now begins on the Isle of Bedloe. You start from the highest<br/>
point in the land, and remember there is no way into the lady's hand.<br/>
Gaze down upon the ramparts of the ol' Fort Wood, view it from the<br/>
fifth window, you should. Don't forget the point of the star you see<br/>
right below, Now head back down to the soil of Bedloe. From the tip of<br/>
that star look out toward the sea, in a northerly direction is where<br/>
you wish to be. Before your feet carry you into the harbor, you will<br/>
notice three machines that help you see farther. Now you ask yourself,<br/>
"Which one can it be?" Well, if you originate from Brobdingnag, a<br/>
problem finishing the clue I forsee. Give this machine your hard earned<br/>
two bits, and scan the horizon for where Old Glory sits. You'll know<br/>
you're looking in the correct place, when you see double right before<br/>
your face! Now you must use all of your powers, and get yourself in<br/>
between those two towers. Here is where the tricky pieces start, Will<br/>
you be able to advance to the next part? "Which path from here?" begins<br/>
your plight, That's easy, follow your inalienable right. Search down<br/>
this path for your next mark,  a circle of red surrounding one that is<br/>
dark. From the center of this spot look out toward the sky, a group of<br/>
tall trees to the north you will spy. Get as close to this grove as the<br/>
state will permit, walk as quickly to the yellow marker as you see fit.<br/>
At 90 degrees you notice the next step in your quest, when you reach it<br/>
pull up a bench for a quick rest. Now you need to know which of the<br/>
three paths to choose, follow where the three boats point and you can't<br/>
lose. Follow this path to your 54th pace, LEFT FACE! Now off the path,<br/>
walk towards the sea, in the cairn between two trees is where your<br/>
treasure will be.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I hope everyone has fun with it! <br/>

server.  The new URL is http://www.crocker.com/~bsennott/letterbox.html<br/>
<br/>
Tom, I set up internal links near the top of the page to each town within<br/>
the page.  I thought you had asked me to do that a while back.  Let me know<br/>
if this is what you wanted.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I had to move the page because I left my old job, where I had a<br/>
free Internet account.  But it's a very happy change!  I'm now the copy<br/>
editor in the Office of Communications at Mount Holyoke College.  And I<br/>
love it!<br/>

your site from the southern New England map. The targets you put in <br/>
