                    <div class="plaintext-content">After my last post I got to thinking about the little silica gels <br/>
paks, wondering if there was any environmental impact or danger to <br/>
animals if the bag should break open.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out that "non-indicating" forms of silica gel (the little white <br/>
pellets) is non-toxic, biologically inert and safe for both pets and <br/>
landfills. (It returns to sand when added to soil). Silica Gel is the <br/>
only dessicant approved by the FDA for use in food application.  <br/>
There is also an "indicating" form that is colored; this is not <br/>
considered safe for animals.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested, there is some good information at this site:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.geejaychemicals.co.uk/default.htm<br/>
<br/>
including how it works to prevent moisture damage and also how to <br/>
rejuvenate spent substance.  I also checked and they are available on <br/>
E-Bay, for about .25/unit.<br/>
