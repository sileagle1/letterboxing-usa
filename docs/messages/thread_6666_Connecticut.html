    Please don't even think of moving!  There is a serius "drought" <br/>
here in MD. You are doing a wonderful job of sprinkling Howard Co.  <br/>
Now that the weather has changed I hope to add a few dewdrops to the <br/>
environment.<br/>
    Thanks for rewriting the Cascades Letterbox. Hope to find it <br/>

<br/>
It was 60 and sunny, a beautiful day for driving a LeMans Blue Metallic Corvette Convertible. I packed up and drove on down to Plainville, Connecticut. <br/>
<br/>
Nothing much happens in Plainville; there isn't even a famous person born here. But, it does hold the Annual Plainville Fire Company Hot Air Balloon Festival. This year it had over 35 balloons, live entertainment, a car and motorcycle show, fireworks, your usual booths of soothsayers and peddlers, and, of course, the typical crappy carnival food. Booking a sunrise balloon ride was the best deal of the whole fest. Landing, I noticed there was quite a commotion in the booth area. Approaching the midway, I was stunned to see Mark Pepe giving a spiel on "You Too Can Change." Fascinated, I listened to the details of his former life of crime and how he is now making amends in the field of teaching. There was even talk of him opening a non-profit museum. Not sure the audience was buying what he was saying, but we all had great fun cheering him on.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who thought P.T. Barnum was only a shyster, think again. Visit The Barnum Museum and you will find that P.T. opened one of the first museums in America, was responsible for the famous "Swedish Nightingale" touring the states, and developed Bridgeport into an industrial leader. I personally enjoyed seeing a piece of Tom Thumb's wedding cake and Pa-Ib.<br/>
<br/>
Bear Mountain is not the highest point in Connecticut. However, it is the highest summit. With a fairly moderate trail it took about 4 hours to reach the top. In spite of being a popular trail, there was plenty of wildlife to be seen. The collapsed pyramid at the top is a bit strange and interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Being a fan of Indiana Jones, I was not leaving Connecticut without visiting The Essex Station. I was pleasantly surprised to find I could take a trip on the Essex Steam Train to the Chester/Hadlyme Ferry. From the Ferry I could then hike to the Gillette Castle. A treat to see Sherlock Holmes sitting room. But, I did not come here to talk about balloons, wedding cake, pyramids or trains; I came to talk letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Connecticut is the Mecca of letterboxing. With almost 3,000 letterboxes that pretty much puts them over the top. A little over 300 mysteries gives a percentage of about 11 percent. I wish it was more, but hey, not bad. It is true that you can stumble over the letterboxes in Connecticut. Not a good thing! Letterboxes are meant to be hidden. If you don't know how to recover a letterbox, then maybe you should not be letterboxing. It is quite disappointing to go walking along a trail and see one sitting on top of the log. Again, I must stress good sturdy containers, camo if you like, and covering well. Hiking in Connecticut is a pleasure. If hiking in high areas, beware of eroded trails and drop offs. If hiking in the wetlands, do not feed the waterfowls. You will do more harm than good. <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
<br/>
Investigator Francis Bacon<br/>
