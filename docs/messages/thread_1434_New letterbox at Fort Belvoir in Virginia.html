Accotink Bay Wildlife Refuge, Fort Belvoir, Virginia<br/>
October 21, 2000<br/>
Easy, Dogs on leash ok, bathrooms available<br/>
Hid by Squirrel and McCoy<br/>
<br/>
Enter the refuge from U.S. 1 and Backlick Road trough the Tully gate. Pass a <br/>
small parking lot on the right and proceed to the second parking lot on the <br/>
right. It is larger and has bathrooms. <br/>

This summer I bought a box of books from an estate sale. They were old and <br/>
dusty and lot of fun to look through. One was a diary and below is a most <br/>
curious entry, maybe you can discover what it is all about. Don't ask and <br/>
don't tell others if you figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
Dear Diary,<br/>
Today I commemorate my love to Mary. Should she ever return she will know how <br/>
I feel. I went on the walk we used to take to the Beaver Pond. My left foot <br/>
leading the way. Up and down and up the familiar steps we took. I stopped and <br/>
looked for the beavers in the pond to the left side of the trail. We envied <br/>
those beavers their lack of concern for society and its rules. I passed the <br/>
little red maple tree we watched grow from a seedling. When I came to the <br/>
crossroads as we did a season ago, I wondered did we take the right road? <br/>
After that first barrier was crossed you had only 15 days to decide. Then <br/>
steps were taken. So here, I rightly sit next to this large gray tree on the <br/>
side of the trail. The answer to my destiny must be buried somewhere here or <br/>
on these pages or in my mind. The bugle calls.<br/>
<br/>
Mary has been gone for a while now and I must go back to work. I will mark <br/>
the spot of our first kiss on the way back to the car with these words of <br/>
love to my dear Mary.  I must keep my chin up as I find that spot. <br/>
<br/>
My Dear Mary,<br/>
Once we were here as one.<br/>
Now apart we know why.<br/>
Forever in my mind is that love.<br/>
For you see I too believe in you.<br/>
Indeed we were real, very real.<br/>
How could I forget.<br/>
Love, ADL<br/>
<br/>
