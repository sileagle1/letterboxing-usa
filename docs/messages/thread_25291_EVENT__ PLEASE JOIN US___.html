                    <div class="plaintext-content">Join us for Richard's Walk!!! There will be a number of boxes to find and we will be hosting a table all about letterboxing.  Box details will be available soon!! The Walk will be held in Voluntown, CT at the Constitution Field and we will be walking through the Pachaug State Forest. There will be a family fun day afterwards with bands, activities, vendors, and a PIG ROAST!!! <br/>
<br/>
We would like to have hitchickers in every box so that our event can "travel" ;) If you are interested in a placing a hitchiker please let me know!! Right now we will need 10!!! <br/>
<br/>
The theme of the boxes will be sports and voluntown related!! As we are trying to encourage a sense of community and youth athletics!! <br/>
<br/>
We would like to encourage boxers to hide boxes around Voluntown for the event!! We will be having a hitchiker hostel and we are also looking for someone to do a demo on stamp craving. There will be prizes for the boxer who traveled the furthest, who's the newest ect.  <br/>
<br/>
PLEASE RSVP so that we know how many name tags, and clue sheets to have on hand!! If you plan on hiding a box in town please let me know so I can add it to the clue sheet!! Hope to see you all there!! <br/>
This is a paid event ($5per person for the fun day $10 max a family if you want to walk it's $25 entry fee to walk $50 max per family and all children under the age of 18 are free and that includes the fun day!!)and is open to all not just "Us Letterboxers" ;) The fee includes a T-shirt and a bottled water for two participants. You can also get a pledge form ahead of time and get pledges for the event. Pre-registration is prefered but you can register on the day of and you don't have to get pledges to walk. There are great prizes including a 42" flat screen TV!!!! for the person who gets the most in pledge money. To win the prizes you must have your pledge forms post marked by Sept. 10th. The entry fee gets you into the family fun day free!! If you would like to just attend the family fun day although you won't be able to get all of the boxes it is $5 and $10 max per family. The Pig Roast is $10 for a sm. and $15 for a Lg. <br/>
<br/>
The boxes along the walk will be left out for the day only. You don't have to particapate in the walk to get the boxes you can go after the walk and find them they will be left out until the following day but you will have to pay the $5 fun day fee in order to get the clues for the boxes that were placed along the walk! We hope that you will walk with the group as the money goes for a great cause! <br/>
