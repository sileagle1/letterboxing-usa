seriously folks, this outing sounds like such a fun day.  Chuck has <br/>

  Don't forget to bring your letterbox to contribute to Irishtinker's <br/>
Childrens' Book series.  I've got my "The Secret Garden" L.B. <br/>
(almost) all put together and ready to go.<br/>
  Wherever you may be, happy hiking/l.b. hunting this weekend.<br/>
