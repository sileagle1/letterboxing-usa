                    <div class="plaintext-content">I finally got out in this beautiful weather to go boxing.  Since I <br/>
was short on time, I decided to do Walk Up Reservation in Westborough <br/>
(which, by the way, is in fine shape).<br/>
<br/>
I usually like to letterbox on weekdays so there is less likelihood <br/>
of "discovery" by other non-letterboxing hikers.<br/>
<br/>
Hikers were out in droves today!  My five year old son was with me.  <br/>
When we finally got to the box, we had to figure out a quick <br/>
distraction.  I remembered Chuck and Molly and the infamous "pooper <br/>
scooper baggie" routine, and I had to think quick.  What would <br/>
McGyver do?<br/>
<br/>
Since I had just come from the gym, I had an oversized sweatshirt on, <br/>
and I was wearing a fanny pack for my gear.  I slid the fanny pack <br/>
around so the "pack" was on my stomach, and I pulled the sweatshirt <br/>
over it, put my hands on my lower back, and put that "I've been <br/>
pregnant *forever*" look on my face, meanwhile saying to my son, <br/>
loudly, "Do you really have to pee right now?"<br/>
<br/>
I tell you, it worked like a charm!  The hikers went right on by, <br/>
doing their very best *not* to make eye contact!<br/>
<br/>
We had to repeat the routine about three times before we got all <br/>
stamped in and got the box back.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails!<br/>
