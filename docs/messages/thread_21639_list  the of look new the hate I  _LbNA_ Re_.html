Maybe this new yahoogroups look is just part of an early April Fools' <br/>
Day joke?  We'll all awake on 2 Apr and everything will be back to the <br/>
old, tried &amp; true, just as user-unfriendly interface we all got so <br/>
used to.  Same old awful message search capabilities and all.  ;)  <br/>
Still wondering why they flipped the messages from oldest to newest at <br/>
top.  Yuck--it doesn't make sense logically...  dvn2r ckr<br/>

This actually ran thru my mind.  :-)<br/>
What other reason would they have to take ONLY the important <br/>
components and delete, reverse, change the meaning of, or make <br/>
frustratingly time consuming to use (and so many unimportant things <br/>
left alone)?<br/>
-a change was wanted, so someone who didn't understand how it worked, <br/>
made all the decisions.<br/>
-a non-English speaking person did it...someone who does NOT read <br/>
from left to right.<br/>
-They were in a rush to get it out and didn't (have time to) test it.<br/>
-It fits the same layout as "Yahoo! News" and they figured they would <br/>
consolidate.<br/>
-April Fools!...please, please, please, Please let me wake up and let <br/>
it be.  If it is, I might believe there really is a bunny that lays <br/>
chocolate eggs.  :-)<br/>
