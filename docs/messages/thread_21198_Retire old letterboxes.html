I am all for retiring letterboxes. I have retired several of my <br/>
boxes. And I have gotten negative feedback about it! But I will <br/>
continue to retire them. <br/>
<br/>
I tried to recall my Alfred Hitchcock hitchhiker. But the people who <br/>
had him would not tell me where they placed him.  They put him in a <br/>
letterbox somewhere and now he is missing, probably never to be <br/>
found again. It makes me crazy, because I was begging these people <br/>
to mail him home to me. <br/>
I wanted to have the stamp and see the logbook with all his travels. <br/>
But these people thought they knew better. They thought the <br/>
hitchhiker should continue to travel. Even though I was the original <br/>
carver and creator of the hitchhiker, they did not respect my <br/>
wishes. <br/>
<br/>
I have also heard from people who want me to replace letterboxes <br/>
that I have retired. I tell them that if they want a letterbox to be <br/>
in that location, then perhaps they should plant one themselves!<br/>

But having people actually plant would defeat their perception that <br/>
planters such as yourself exist to serve them!  ;-)<br/>
