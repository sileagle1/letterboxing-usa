                    <div class="plaintext-content">I decided to "duck" out at lunchtime and snag a nearby<br/>
letterbox. The paved path is rough having been made uneven by roots <br/>
pushing up. This is the second box I have successfully located <br/>
without a compass when the directions contained bearings. But at the <br/>
junction there was a path going roughly the direction I had estimated <br/>
I should go and I was successful on my first attempt and did not have <br/>
to backtrack. <br/>
<br/>
Puddle Duck is an apt description. With all the rain we have been <br/>
getting there was standing water on the right side of the path. The <br/>
paces (two footfalls) counted out just right. When it came time to <br/>
leave the trail the ground was squishy mud. I took a tentative first <br/>
step and did not sink up to my ankles so decided to try another step. <br/>
When I could pull my foot up for a step and not leave my shoe behind <br/>
I whooped for joy. I hadn't quite figured out how I was going to <br/>
return to work muddy and shoeless. <br/>
<br/>
The contents were dry and snug in their box.<br/>
<br/>
I did not see another person on the trail although they were coming <br/>
and going at the library. On my trek out, a nearby squirrel ignored <br/>
me, but I disturbed a chipmunk that proceeded to run along the trail <br/>
and was sure I was after him. When I finally turned toward the <br/>
parking lot he stopped still, stood, and watched me closely as I <br/>
retreated. <br/>
<br/>
That's when I discovered that although I had made it out with<br/>
both my shoes, I had still managed to splash mud up my slacks. But I <br/>
had my stamp so I was happy!<br/>

stamps. Thank you!<br/>
