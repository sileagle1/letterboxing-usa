<div>This letterbox is at the Greenway Farms, 
Hixson Tn. (Hamilton County) .   Greenway Farms is a lovely part of 
the City parks system and an easy place to spend the day. There is a quarry 
there, several trails, a couple of canoe put-ins (bring yours if you are making 
a special trip) and  tennis courts to use if you like. The box was 
placed there in July by Girl Scout troops 121 and 470 as part of an orienteering 
exercise. </div>
<div>Here is how to find it:<br/>Go to the 
carport behind the house. Beside the road is a "no vehicles" sign. Count your 
paces as you head between the oak and the spruce (mostly westerly) to the 
tallest gravestone in the cemetary.  It belongs to Mary Russell, born 1794. 
When you arrive at her stone, consider it took me 100 paces exactly. This be 
easy once you relate your paces to mine!<br/>With Mary's stone at your back and 
facing west, you will see a ridgetop in the distance with towers on it. Multiply 
their number by 11 and walk that many paces. Stop here and look around- you will 
see chesnut trees that are here as a growing experiment by the Tennessee 
Aquarium and UTC. Take their number (don't miss any!) and multiply it by 10. 
That many paces SSW and you will take the third of six alike and search that 
letterbox out of it! Please hang it back off the ground, as the mowers might hit 
it accidentally. <br/>Don't forget pace 
conversion!<br/></div></body></html>
