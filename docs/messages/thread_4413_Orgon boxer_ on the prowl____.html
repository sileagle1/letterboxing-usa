                    <div class="plaintext-content">Rood Bridge Park box: Beautiful stamp!  There's been some debate <br/>
whether to count the box as one box or three.  I'm in favor of <br/>
counting it as three.  If it looks like a box, smells like a box, and <br/>
has a stamp, it must be a box!  Right?  The fact there was no <br/>
notebook in two of the boxes to stamp into isn't much of a handicap <br/>
either.  Just stamped in on a piece of paper and add it to the box.  <br/>
See, it's a BOX!  Even exchanged stamps!  =)  Speaking of this box, <br/>
that's a clever little mechanism you designed for the second "clue".  <br/>
Have you guys been taking hiding lessons from Mitch?<br/>
<br/>
Ace of Fun: Stupid letter games, but the box has finally been found.  <br/>
However, the stamp will have to forever be secret except to those <br/>
who've found the box since it has the location of the box on the <br/>
stamp.  Speaking of which, Funhog, didn't you learn not to do that <br/>
with the Spirit of Dartmoor fiasco?!  If you must carve letters on a <br/>
mystery box, carve the name of the box, not where it's located!  I <br/>
take no responsibility if someone inadvertantly catches sight of the <br/>
image in my book and it gives away the location.....  =)<br/>
<br/>
I also hunted for the PCC Sylvania series.  Despite all the compass <br/>
directions and pace counting, I didn't find the clues too difficult.  <br/>
Just follow the directions and they lead you right to the right place <br/>
every time!  However, box #2 does seem to be missing.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which....  I'm anxious to pick up more stamps, and if <br/>
Mitch doesn't rehide some missing boxes, I might have to take the <br/>
liberty of rehiding them for him.  I've got sources for the images of <br/>
the missing stamps to recarve them.  ;o)  In particular the PCC <br/>
Sylvania #2, Ponytail Falls, and Wahkeena Falls letterboxes.  Then I <br/>
can rehide them and count them as founds.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Other boxes to note:<br/>
<br/>
The Maryhill Museum box has a BEAUTIFUL stamp in it!  Definitely a <br/>
must catch if you're in the area.  I missed out on the Horsethief <br/>
Lake box since the park was closed (and they GUARD the place so I <br/>
couldn't sneak in easily!), so I'll be back in the area eventually.  <br/>
Perhaps hiding a box near Stonehenge.  The place is begging for a box!<br/>
<br/>
Bishop's Close: Nice stamp, why isn't anybody visiting it?!  It's in <br/>
a very nice garden, easily accessible, requires no real hiking, no <br/>
tromping through mud, and I'm amazed nobody else has gone out to hunt <br/>
for it yet!<br/>
<br/>
Columbia River Slough Series:  Only box #5 still remains....  But I <br/>
have it under good authority all of the missing boxes will be <br/>
replaced or rehidden at some point in time....<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow....  that about exhausts my Portland area supply of boxes to <br/>
find.  Guess I'll have to start expanding my "territory" to <br/>
Washington and California or places farther out in Oregon!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Farewell!<br/>
