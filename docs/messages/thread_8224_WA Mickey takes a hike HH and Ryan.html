I wouldn't count the same hitchhiker twice, but you can make a good <br/>
argument for it.  Especially if you find it in a different state than <br/>
from where you hid it!  =)<br/>
<br/>
If I found one a second time, I'd probably be thrilled to death, but <br/>
I probably wouldn't pick it up to move again unless I had a good <br/>
reason for it.  (Can't think of an example off the top of my head, <br/>
but I hate making all-encompassing comments like I'd NEVER pick it up <br/>
if I found it a second time.)<br/>
