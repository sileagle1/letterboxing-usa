Dawes Arboretum series<br/>
4 boxes<br/>
Difficulty: easy to moderate<br/>
Distance: 3.5 miles, accessible by car, bike, or foot<br/>
Willowanderers pace count is 53 per 100 yards<br/>
<br/>
	Dawes Arboretum is located on Ohio SR 13, about 3.5 miles north of <br/>
I-70 exit 132.  It comprises several hundred acres of rolling fields <br/>
and woodlands.  The arboretum has many native trees and other plants <br/>
natural settings, also many popular and more rare landscape plants in <br/>
formal and semiformal settings.  There is a nature center, picnic <br/>
shelter, trails, bonsai collection, and many other features which we <br/>
will leave for your own discovery.  All the boxes in this series are on <br/>
the auto tour route.  Maps are available in the foyer of the visitor <br/>
center, which is open whenever the gates are open.<br/>
	Gates open early, between 7 and 9 AM, depending on sunrise, and close <br/>
at dusk, which may be as early as 6:45 PM or as late as 9:30.  Call for <br/>
hours if thats an issue.  the visitor center and nature center are <br/>
open more regular hours, 8:30-4:30 or so.  Dogs are allowed on leash.<br/>
	The city of Newark and village of Granville are nearby, with many <br/>
attractions both natural and manufactured, including more letterboxes.  <br/>
a favorite stop for lunch is Clarks restaurant in Jacksontown at the <br/>
intersection of SR 13 and US 40.  Dont miss the family style dinner on <br/>
Sunday.  Please report problems with any of these boxes to <br/>
WilloWanderers (tburkett@laca.org)<br/>
<br/>
Please note: The arboretum is well tended and heavily visited.  Be <br/>
especially careful when collecting and replacing boxes, as when <br/>
stamping in.<br/>
<br/>
Nakamuras Vision<br/>
	One of the highlights of the park is the work of Makoto Nakamura, who <br/>
designed a garden in 1964 and returned to oversee its development and <br/>
completion.  Find the entrance to this garden, near its own parking <br/>
area, and look for the sign describing its features.   Note especially <br/>
the Iwagumi (manicured rock garden) to your left.  From the sign, <br/>
proceed 32 paces (1 pace=2 steps) at a bearing of 190 degrees.  At this <br/>
fork, bear off south along the path for an additional 75 paces.  Step <br/>
thirteen stones and find a place to sit with forty holes at your back.  <br/>
The object you seek will be below your left hand.  Look around, be <br/>
discreet.  This is a popular area!  Stamp in, then continue around the <br/>
path to enjoy the stepping stones, arch bridges, and bamboo garden as <br/>
you return to your starting point.<br/>
<br/>
Commanding View<br/>
	Passing pilots can not only see the arboretum, but know what it is.  <br/>
Once you know how this is possible, youll be on your way to solving <br/>
this set of clues:<br/>
<br/>
Fourteen it has that can be read, elevens the one for you<br/>
Stand at the tip of the center prong, look a spell, enjoy the view.<br/>
Turn north and south and east and west, at a hundred and ten degrees<br/>
Youll see afar the thing you seek, standing among the trees.<br/>
Pace off on that heading as best you can, counting a hundred and nine<br/>
Then turn to your right and count again, forty one steps up this time.<br/>
Three hundred and ten degrees and down, youll see a lonely shrub,<br/>
Uncle Jack Fogy is his name, beneath him you must grub.<br/>
Still hes in a spot that may be seen by those both far and near,<br/>
So quiet and quick your work must be, to use whats hidden here.<br/>
<br/>
Trees Knees<br/>
	Dawn-redwoods, members of the cypress family, were thought to be <br/>
extinct until a grove of them were discovered in the 1940s in China.  <br/>
These ancient and fascinating trees have a beautiful orange bark and a <br/>
unique conical shape.  You will find one, with a plaque dedicating it <br/>
to Dorothy &amp; Stanley Rowe, near its cousins (the ones with knees).  <br/>
Cypress trees grow knees to help them breathe, as their roots are often <br/>
completely submerged.<br/>
	Find the dedicatory plaque and look to your left for a series of red <br/>
painted boards.  Cross 123 of these, taking every available turn, and <br/>
youll arrive at a point where wood meets stone and earth.  Step off 21 <br/>
paces at 160 degrees and look for your prize among the humus in the <br/>
center of a large rotting stump.  Step lightly, as the area is rife <br/>
with wildflowers.  Note, too, that you are easily visible from the road <br/>
and a number of other areas where people tend to congregate.<br/>
<br/>
Wood, Water, &amp; Stone<br/>
	Stand at the top of the observation tower and look off at 310 degrees. <br/>
  Spy a tree with white bark close to a picnic table or two?  Go there, <br/>
and sit on the stone bench near the white barked tree.  Take a bearing <br/>
of 40 degrees, and move 5 paces, then 8 paces more with your left hand <br/>
on a rail.  Look below your feet.<br/>
<br/>

TJ Evans Bike Trail Series<br/>
3 boxes<br/>
Difficulty: easy to moderate<br/>
Distance: varies from .5 to 1.5 miles, accessible by bike or foot<br/>
Willowanderers pace count is 53 per 100 yards<br/>
<br/>
	The TJ Evans Bike Trail runs from Newark to Johnstown along an <br/>
abandoned rail line.  It is asphalt paved and accommodates biking, <br/>
hiking, blading, scootering, wheelchairs, and strollers.  Parking is <br/>
available at almost every road crossing, with lots in Newark (Cherry <br/>
Valley Road), Granville (Main Street and Wildwood Park), Alexandria <br/>
(off N. Liberty street), and Johnstown (Jersey Street).  All towns have <br/>
food and other services.  Newark has bike shops.<br/>
<br/>
Mastodon<br/>
	The most complete mastodon skeleton ever discovered was unearthed near <br/>
Johnstown in 1926.  Celebrate by finding this box, made somewhat <br/>
challenging by the uniformity of terrain and flora.  Begin by finding <br/>
the 13 mile mark on the bike trail, located between Windy Hollow and <br/>
Concord Roads, a bit more than a mile east of Johnstown.  From this <br/>
point, count 174 paces (1 pace= 2 steps) NW along the trail.  Turn to <br/>
220 degrees and count six paces from the edge of the trail.  Your goal <br/>
is a tree with four trunks, growing along the fenceline.  Your prize is <br/>
in the crotch of the tree.  Be sure to camouflage it well when <br/>
replacing it, as it may be visible from the trail if you dont.<br/>
	As this may be a tough find, here are some landmarks.  There is a fair <br/>
sized rock along the fence 4 paces NW of the tree.  Two large square <br/>
wooden posts are set in the fence 22 paces NW of the tree.  From <br/>
Concord Road, the posts are 170 paces SE.<br/>
<br/>
Clemons Station<br/>
	If you are not starting from somewhere else on the bike trail, you may <br/>
choose to start at the West Broadway crossing, less than a mile south <br/>
of OH 161 on the west end of Granville.  Take the trail west a bit more <br/>
than a mile, past the 5.5 mile marker.<br/>
	At the turn of the century the Toledo and Central Ohio Railroad ran <br/>
through all the little towns in the Raccoon Valley.  It might be hard <br/>
to imagine that there was a rail station between Granville and <br/>
Alexandria, as the two are only six miles apart.  Still, the <br/>
foundations of it are here for you to see.  Find the  historical marker <br/>
on the south side of the trail.<br/>
	Stand directly between the marker and the foundation, turn to 320 <br/>
degrees and step off 26 paces along the trail.  Turn to 40 degrees and <br/>
go 3 paces from the edge of the trail.  Look for two old railroad ties <br/>
just to the right of a large sycamore tree.  The top tie is rotted out <br/>
and covered with moss.  Look beneath it.<br/>
<br/>
Interurban<br/>
	All the little towns in this valley had both rail and interurban <br/>
service.  One of the large manufacturers of interurban cars, Jewett <br/>
Company, was located in Newark.  You can see a restored car and learn <br/>
more of its history at The Works, a technology museum in downtown <br/>
Newark.  The eastern terminus of this trail was once called Central <br/>
City, and was home to many railroad workers and railroad facilities.  <br/>
Now its home to an ice cream shop, a pizza shop, a smoothie store, a <br/>
coffee shop, and a mini mart.<br/>
	Travel northwest on the trail, past the .5 mile marker, and look for a <br/>
wooden bench on the south side of the trail, just at the point where <br/>
Raccoon Creek veers away to the north.  Standing on the trail even with <br/>
the bench, proceed 14 paces at 320 degrees.  Look for a long moss <br/>
covered fallen tree parallel to the trail on the south side.  Two paces <br/>
off the trail at 230 degrees is the root end of the tree, in a tangle <br/>
of shrubbery, a small tree, and some old fencing.  Look beneath a large <br/>
flat rock on the other side of the fallen tree.  (About halfway along <br/>
the trunk a bluebird house is attached to a fence post.)<br/>
