At the end of the 3rd age, when 1000 years of peaceful isolation threatened <br/>
to end for our ancient homeland (called in those days "Shire"), my <br/>
great-great grandfather (thrice removed), Peregrin Took passed down the story <br/>
through family history of his great journey with the reluctant ring master <br/>
Frodo Baggins. For all the Hobbits in the diaspora since those heroic days, <br/>
the story has been considered more legend than fact.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to visit the ancient garden of Galadril and see for myself if the <br/>
old words were true, and there I found, hidden under a light in a beautiful <br/>
garden, a treasured memory of Frodo's Dream. Although the garden had been <br/>
carefully tended since the time of Frodo and Sam, and even though the secret <br/>
spot was now wreathed in ornamental lights for the winter celebration (and <br/>
with equipment placed but inches away), the ancient artifacts were intact and <br/>
had no evidence of having been visited since the days of yore. I carefully <br/>
returned the treasure to it's place, just a few scant feet from the well <br/>
traveled path, thinking that it was surely of elvin workmanship, being the <br/>
most beautiful of all the old images I have collected.<br/>
<br/>
It appears that the stories of old contained in the Red Book are true.<br/>
