                    <div class="plaintext-content">    Diane and I took a long weekend to wander around.  Last Thursday, the 3rd, we found The Vermont Tree and The Brownsville Cemetary in good condition.  We couldn't stay around Brownsville, though, for the others.  We went camping in Quebec to visit the old Poutine letterbox (more about that in another post!) and to plant a letterbox on the Ile d'Orleans.  I'll post the clues when I get my backlogged work caught up!  If you're going by Quebec City this weekend, let me know!<br/>
    Sunday the 7th we carefully avoided the moose on Route 201.  Later on that road, we passed a crowd gathered around a bashed-in truck that foolishly didn't avoid the other moose.  Evening found us around Skowhegan, ME.  We visited Canoe Portage and the awesome Wire Bridge on Monday, then meandered off to the Snow Falls Snowflake.  You've all picked great spots, and the stamps were very well done!  Thanks again!<br/>
