Assawoman WMA<br/>

Finding the letterbox is not nearly as difficult as finding Assawoman WMA but <br/>
it is well worth a visit. There are lots of ponds and places for birds to <br/>
hang out and for you to find when you are not looking for letterboxes. Stop <br/>
at the tower (duh!) and begin your search. Go to the tower leg on the right <br/>
side that is closest to the water. From there you will see a faint trail <br/>
leading into the woods. Just after you enter the woods take 13 steps at 340 <br/>
degrees to a tree. Look to the base of that tree down deep under the pine <br/>
needles for the letterbox. <br/>
