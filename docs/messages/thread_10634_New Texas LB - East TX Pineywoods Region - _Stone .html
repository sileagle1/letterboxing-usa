Texas History Letterbox Series<br/>
<br/>
The "Stone Celt" letterbox is located at the southernmost ceremonial <br/>
center of the great Mound Builder Culture, which spanned the length <br/>
and breadth of the woodlands of eastern North America for over 2,500 <br/>
years (1,000 BC  1500 AD).  The site's visitor center has exhibits <br/>
and an audio-visual program, as well as a  mile self-guided trail.  <br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
Located six miles southwest of Alto, on highway 21.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Pick up a trail map in the visitor center, then exit out the back.  <br/>
Go right (Northwest) on the loop trail, past "the Burial Mound", <br/>
turning South, for a total of about 200 yards.  Just after the "low <br/>
Temple Mound" sign, take the spur trail to the right (West) for 30 <br/>
paces to the viewing platform for "The Burrow Pit".  At the beginning <br/>
of the wood railing, step off the right side of the path and walk <br/>
along the outside of the boardwalk platform, heading West for 4 <br/>
paces.  Where the cement ends, and the wood planks begin, the box can <br/>
be found on the ground up against the cement wall, below the 1st wood <br/>
plank.<br/>
