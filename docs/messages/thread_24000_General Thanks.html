on each of the 4 days of this holiday weekend.  Although the actual <br/>
Thanksgiving Day has officially passed by, we'd like to take this <br/>
opportunity at the end of the weekend to give some thanks.  In <br/>
addition to all the major things we're thankful for (health, family &amp; <br/>
friends, our jobs), we're also thankful for all the pleasure <br/>
letterboxing has provided us.  So here's a short list of some <br/>
letterboxing thanks:<br/>
<br/>
1. Thanks to all of you hide boxes and thereby give us the <br/>
satisfaction of solving the clues, enjoying the places you have <br/>
chosen to share with us, and appreciating your creative stamps.<br/>
<br/>
2. Thanks to all of you who have put the time and energy into <br/>
planning a letterboxing event.  We've been able to attend several <br/>
over the past 3 years and really appreciate the creativity and hard <br/>
work that goes into putting these together.<br/>
<br/>
3. Thanks to all of you that have taken the time to meet with us for <br/>
a hike and/or a meal when we are traveling in your area.  It's great <br/>
to meet "the locals" when we are away from home.<br/>
<br/>
4. Thanks to all of you who send us an email after finding one of our <br/>
boxes or hitchhikers.  We're greatful to get the updates and enjoy <br/>
hearing a bit of your adventures in finding them.<br/>
