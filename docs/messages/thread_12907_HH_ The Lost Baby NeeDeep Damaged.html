We had time so we went after the Pine Barrens, again we had success <br/>
and got a hitchhiker for the gathering, The Lost Baby NeeDeep.  Both <br/>
the Dancing Men and the Pine Barrens boxes were in very good shape, <br/>
only five blank pages left in the log for the Dancing Men.  <br/>
Unfortunatly The Baby NeeDeep didn't fair so well.  All parts were <br/>
recovered although they were loose on the ground.  The stamp was <br/>
detached from the wood but is in good shape.  The log and the <br/>
tupperware container have teeth marks in them, the log isn't too bad <br/>
we will replace the container.  As I remarked above we will bring the <br/>
Lost Baby to the gathering tomorrow so the NeeDeeps can reletter the <br/>
new box.<br/>
