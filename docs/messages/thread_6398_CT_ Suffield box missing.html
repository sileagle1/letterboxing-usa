CT is; but the box appears to be missing!  We had logged in many <br/>
months ago and this past weekend were passing through town and wanted <br/>
to have a friend of ours find it.  We went to the same location as <br/>
previously found and the box was not there.  Anyone seen it recently <br/>
or know who the owner is?<br/>

 I , leader of the Pack planted Winter Gather in Suffield after many  <br/>
recieved the stamp image at our Tolland Ct. gather. I'm soory to hear <br/>
it has gone astray. Since the report came from someone who had been <br/>
there before I do believe it is gone. There wasn't really a way you <br/>
could miss that one. So webmaster could you note missing on its page <br/>
or pull it.. thanks<br/>

This may warrant another look, as I found it on Saturday, July 20.  <br/>
I'm not sure where it normally is, but I found it pretty deep <br/>
underneath and so returned it there....  Granted, it was my first <br/>
letterbox, but I think it is certainly possible to miss it (at least <br/>
where I found it!) - required getting on my hands and knees and <br/>
getting a face full of shrubbery to see it.... <br/>
<br/>
I live locally and will check on it soon.<br/>
