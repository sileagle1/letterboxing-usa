<br/>
You ever have one of those days out on the trail?<br/>
Today was one of those days for us.<br/>
<br/>
The day started off well. Got an early start, good<br/>
weather, good coffee. The trail is a couple hundred<br/>
yards from our house. We've been meaning to plant on<br/>
it for months. Finally carved the stamp last night. We<br/>
planned on planting two today, to make it to PFX 300. <br/>
<br/>
We park at the trailhead, which is in the middle of<br/>
the trail, and head out downriver. The trail runs<br/>
along a flood dike. Which makes for very poor cover,<br/>
and virtually nowhere to hide a box. And the only<br/>
place we found that was likely the stupid box didn't<br/>
fit under. We quickly turned back to the van, and<br/>
drove to another end of the trail. <br/>
<br/>
The trail ends, on the upriver side, near a nice park<br/>
right along the river. Again, we find no place to hide<br/>
the stupid box. Beginning to think we should have<br/>
gotten a smaller tupperware, we drive to the other end<br/>
of the trail, about 1.5 miles across town.<br/>
<br/>
Guess what we didn't find at the other end of the<br/>
trail? That's the kind of day we're having. At this<br/>
point, between all the walking around, scouting and<br/>
driving, we've been out on this trail for about three<br/>
hours. You'd think it would be hard to spend three<br/>
hours on less than two miles of trail. Apparantly not.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally enough, my wife thinks this is hillarious.<br/>
She seems to think that me jumping up and down and<br/>
swearing at the trail is funny. I failed to appreciate<br/>
the humor at the time.<br/>
<br/>
We eventually end up back at the parking lot. At this<br/>
point, we've checked under a railroad bridge, numerous<br/>
rocks and logs, and found nowhere to plant. We walk<br/>
along the trail again, to where a nature trail is<br/>
supposed to be. There is one, sort of. In an area that<br/>
floods every year.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
We decide, on a last minute whim, to walk the trail<br/>
again from the parking lot, and go just a tad bit<br/>
farther than the first time. And we finally find it.<br/>
The perfect spot.<br/>
<br/>
And it's nearly three, almost four hours later, and<br/>
we've got to go pick up the kids at school. <br/>
<br/>
Back to the car, pick up the boys, and back to the<br/>
hiding spot. Finally plant it. Four hours after we<br/>
started. Thankfully, the second plant went much more<br/>
smoothly, and we made our goal before dark. <br/>
<br/>
So you people better like this box, or so help me....<br/>
