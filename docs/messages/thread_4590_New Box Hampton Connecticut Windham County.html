<p>Location: Hampton Connecticut, Windham County</p>
<p>Rated: Easy</p>
<p>Easy walk and parking. Although the letterbox is located only 6-10 feet up a 
hill it is difficult going up the steep hill to the box. Go east on route 6 from 
North Windham towards Hampton, take a right hand turn onto South Brook Road. Go 
a short distance on S Brook Road until you see Parker Road. Park near this 
intersection. Take the old Air Line railroad East of the intersection. Proceed 
down the tracks under the old wooden bridge. Very few of these bridges are left 
standing. You will be walking down the old rail line between cut ledge on both 
sides. When you come to a stone retaining wall on your left, follow it to its 
end. You will see a small curve in the wall at the very end. It points about 6 
or 10 feet up a steep hill, to 3 trees growing from one trunk, and two trees 
that grow from one trunk. In between these trees there is a small rock you will 
need to move to reveal a large cavity in the rock. Remove the small stone and 
reach in to the right and you have found the Clarks Corner Letterbox. The walk 
to this box is about 5 to 10 minutes.</p></div></body></html>
