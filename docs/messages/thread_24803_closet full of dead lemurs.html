                    <div class="plaintext-content">Box #2 of South Mountain Trinity is still in place.  I<br/>
took the sodden logbook home one week and dried it<br/>
out.  The landmarks getting to the box are a bit<br/>
different, but the final resting spot is the same.  <br/>
<br/>
I've looked for several other ADG boxes, but had only<br/>
one other success.  <br/>
<br/>
Let us know if you find others of yours still out<br/>
there!<br/>
<br/>
I recommend Wood Thrush's Serpentine Barrens in the<br/>
greater Baltimore area.  A good hike!<br/>

  We were talking about you at a gather awhile ago, wondering what you were up to! There's a gather in May "Celebrate-Campin' &amp; Stampin'" that I sure hope you'll come to!<br/>
