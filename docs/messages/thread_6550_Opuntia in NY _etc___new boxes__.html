have been out there for a while have now been posted on our webpage:<br/>
<br/>
   http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html<br/>
<br/>
#37 is Opuntia in NY, located on Sugarloaf in the Hudson Highlands <br/>
across the river from West Point, and #20 is Part 2 of the Polish <br/>
Series "Dwa Polakow slynnych", which I had so much trouble trying to <br/>
get permission to place last October that I ended up planting it <br/>
elsewhere! Unfortunately, Part 1 of that series now seems to have <br/>
gone missing, as reported by CSCM a while back and recently confirmed<br/>
by a quick box check. Perhaps it will turn up again,like our "Dancing <br/>
Men" did last October, but meanwhile please don't go looking for Part <br/>
1 unless we report that it has been replaced. In the meantime we <br/>
wonder who will find Part 2! Have fun - baw sie dobrze!<br/>
