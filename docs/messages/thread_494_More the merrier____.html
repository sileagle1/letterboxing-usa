Since my Letterboxer quotient is currently P0/F0 (placed zero, found zero<br/>
(yet!) this may seem to be continuing the long-hanging list/site<br/>
discussion, but I enjoy this list and am glad to be a part of it and want<br/>
to contribute an opinion... <br/>
<br/>
I like looking for, finding and comparing websites. I love seeing lots of<br/>
different ideas and styles on the web. I also think that uber-sites<br/>
(umbrella sites) are an important need, especially for the reasons Deborah<br/>
mentioned. In addition to any and all official, group run, organizationally<br/>
focused sites (commercial or not) I would love to see gobs and gobs of<br/>
personal letterboxing sites, regional sites, tools and techniques sites,<br/>
etc.. Nothing thrills me more than seeing sites proliferate in celebration<br/>
of a wonderful hobby or pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it would be a good tack to let as many types of sites pop up as<br/>
possible, and then any interested ubersite  can scan and surf and collect<br/>
them for linking, and if the ubersite has some magnificent techno-engine<br/>
that helps it to be the most efficient and traffic-generating site for the<br/>
hobby (as has already been displayed by the mapping technique) people will<br/>
chose to be part of it, either by linking or posting clues or being linked,<br/>
rather than feel some sense of pressure, or think that there is only one<br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the successful resource sites I know of put a lot of effort in<br/>
keeping current with new sites, and linking to them. Usually this means<br/>
that whoever(s) are developing the resource site know a heck of a lot about<br/>
the web landscape and this creates an expertise that is evident in the<br/>
resource site. These are the sites that I trust and return to often. <br/>
<br/>
I think that there are letterboxers out there that are not yet using the<br/>
web as a resource, and as the online letterboxing community gets bigger and<br/>
bigger, then more sites and more lists and most importantly, *more boxes*<br/>
enrich the whole deal.<br/>
<br/>
After all, to get good ideas, you have to have *lots* of ideas!  %^)<br/>

I appreciate your thoughtful comments - the organizational "structure"<br/>
(or perhaps, lack of it) seems to me to be the most dynamic model to<br/>
follow. Like the hobby itself in the US, the organization, whether one<br/>
or many sites, will evolve in whatever works best for those using teh<br/>
resource. I don't think we need to plan every last detail to have viable<br/>
ways of getting info available and distributed.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps some see it an anarchy - but in a way, that is the web.<br/>

Thanks for the thoughts, Kate! I'm turned head over heels as for some<br/>
reason I never too much thought of the site looking for the letterboxer<br/>
rather than the letterboxer looking for the site.... still new at this, I <br/>
guess. The funny thing ~ your view of being thrilled at tons and <br/>
tons of new sites ~ I guess I would find that exciting, too, and I<br/>
like exploring sometimes, but mostly I groan when I see that <br/>
sentence.... you know, the one that says "AltaVista has found <br/>
985388 web sites for you". (As you may have guessed, I'm terrible<br/>
at finding what I'm looking for....)<br/>

Kate...Hi!  Don't feel bad about your Letterboxer quotient (hereafter LBQ).<br/>
 My LBQ was P0/F0 for a long time.  It's currently P6/F1, but I really hope<br/>
to get the "F" up soon.  As more people place boxes I'm sure I'll have the<br/>
opportunity. I'm certainly glad you're a part of the hobby!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I like looking for, finding and comparing websites. I love seeing lots of<br/>
&gt;different ideas and styles on the web. I also think that uber-sites<br/>
&gt;(umbrella sites) are an important need, especially for the reasons Deborah<br/>

<br/>
I agree with you 100%.  The nature of "the web" is, by design<br/>
de-centralized.  Uber-sites (great word, BTW) like Letterboxing-USA are<br/>
very important for cataloging centralized information about a hobby and<br/>
providing links (either local or off-site) to other info.  I'm all for<br/>
keeping things informal and letting letterboxers do their thing.<br/>

  In reading the posts on this topic I was reminded of the web ring sort of<br/>
structure that I have seen used to link a number of different sites on the<br/>
same topic.  I could envision the letterboxing presence on the net evolving<br/>
into a similar format.  Just a sort of semirandom musing.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I think this is a really good idea. I've seen lots of other web rings that<br/>
are on the web, and this burgeoning hobby (with it's many and varied<br/>
personalities and opinions) seems to be an excellent candidate <br/>
for the webring idea.  <br/>
