                    <html><body><div>I was wondering if the person in charge of the Pyramids at Giza section of this journey could answer a question for me. My husband and I have already found the stamp, so it won't be giving anything away and you can email me personally...we were just wondering what B. M. L. stood for. We never could figure it out, even after we found the stamp. </div> <div> </div> <div>Also, just thought we'd let you know the container was getting very moldy and, unfortunately, we had nothing to clean it with. The paper inside was damp as well. Just thought we'd let you know so you could check on it and replace if necessary.</div> <div> </div> <div>Thanks,</div> <div>Jill aka Lillbit<br/><br/></div></body></html>
