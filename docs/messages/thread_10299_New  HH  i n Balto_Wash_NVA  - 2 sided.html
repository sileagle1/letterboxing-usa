<br/>
Reading back on what I wrote so long ago, I guess it probably sounded <br/>
more harsh than I wanted, but I've had conversations with multiple <br/>
people about certain people (who will rename nameless!) about their <br/>
volume of posts.  And it seems at least one person has written under <br/>
an assumed name to Psycomommy thinking that very thing about her, so <br/>
I'm obviously not the only person thinking such thoughts!<br/>
<br/>
Others on the board might think every one of her posts are incredibly <br/>
inciteful and interesting, though, and may want to read it.  It <br/>
doesn't really bother me much one way or another--I don't read all of <br/>
the posts on this board--there's too many to keep up with on a <br/>
regular basis.  I just scan the titles and skip ones that don't look <br/>
like they'd be of any interest to me.  (Usually anything regarding <br/>
the east coast because, well, I live on the west coast.  Nothing <br/>
personal!)<br/>
<br/>
I actually missed the 2-sided HH joke until it was pointed out to me <br/>
because I didn't realize it had anything to do with me just reading <br/>
the title!<br/>
<br/>
And, as the one anonymous e-mailer claimed, they put psychomommy on <br/>
their "ignore" list, so it's not as if the posts should be bothering <br/>
them very much--he (or she) doesn't get them in the first place.  (I <br/>
know of at least one person who put me on their 'ignore' list, but I <br/>
suspect there's probably several, at least!  =)  Which is another <br/>
perfectly reasonable way to cut down on the number of posts if one <br/>
doesn't want to read them all.<br/>
<br/>
It's not much of a hassle to skip posts that don't interest you <br/>
(either because of who's posting them or otherwise).  But I guess you <br/>
should be warned--some people may not like to read 30 posts about <br/>
every tiny detail of every letterboxing outing you make.  It's not a <br/>
rule.  It's not even really meant to be a suggestion, but rather an <br/>
FYI--not everyone will appreciate it if you're a serial poster.  But <br/>
hey, it's your right to do so if you choose to!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I hope the 2-sided HH and the serial poster threads die a <br/>
quick death.  The first was meant as a joke (which I kind of enjoyed--<br/>
thanks for having the guts to post it!) and the second one isn't even <br/>
worth the effort to argue because, who cares?  Skip the posts you're <br/>
not interested in and move on!<br/>

PS. Do you need a better image of me than I have on my website to <br/>
carve that 2-sided HH?  =)  It's not going to be a CRAPPY hitchhiker, <br/>
is it?  If I'm going to be immortalized on a stamp, I want it to be a <br/>
GREAT stamp!  ;o)<br/>
