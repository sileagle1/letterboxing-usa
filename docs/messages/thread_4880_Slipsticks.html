                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was taught to use a slipstick way back in the early 1960's when I was <br/>
either 7 or 8 years old. My grandfather felt it was my right to know how to <br/>
use a slide rule. This guy was teaching me logarithms at the age of 10 too.<br/>
<br/>
I got one of those new calculators for a high school graduation present <br/>
from my father. It ran about $100 back then. It was one of Texas <br/>
Instruments earliest models. It only did basic functions. I never trusted <br/>
it. I always feared pushing the wrong button.<br/>
<br/>
I don't use a slide rule anymore, but I imagine I still could. I'll bet <br/>
it's like riding a bike.<br/>

I personally think that bike-riding myth is just that! The last time I <br/>
tried to ride my daughter's bike it was, well, lets just say I did not <br/>
take to it like a duck to water <grin>.<br/>
<br/>
As for sliderules, I remember my oldest brother used one, but I never <br/>
learned how. I suppose it would be an interesting skill to learn, <br/>
kinda like using a drop-spindle to make yarn.<br/>
