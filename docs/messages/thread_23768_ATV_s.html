I do use a compass ( prefer not to). I don't take very long hikes anyway.<br/>

The ATV's are a big pain on Long Island , particularly in our Pine Barren <br/>
Region.  If law enforcement catches them they are fined and their ATVs are <br/>
impounded.  But they still ride in the woods.  There are some plans for a ATV Park.  <br/>
We have one in Riverhead, I think it cost $10 and is too much and too far for <br/>
the under 18 year old who should not be driving without a driver's license <br/>
anyway.<br/>

<br/>
In answer to your question about GPS.  I see this as just another way to provide varied clues.  While not everyone will have a GPS, not every box is for every person.  There are some boxes that require a boat and not everyone has access to a boat.  There are some that require one to be a master diver and not everyone qualifies for that.  I would seek a letterbox that uses GPS coordinates for clues.  My disinterest in geocaching is not the GPS, rather it is primarily the trade trinkets versus the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Go for it!<br/>

other hand, some seldom used trails are only kept open by ATV riders. I <br/>
don't have a problem with moderate ATV use by responsible riders, but I <br/>
believe they should have their own trail system, not use hiking trails.<br/>
<br/>
I've thought of combining a letterbox with a geocache - use the GPS <br/>
coordinates to find the initial position to start following clues to the <br/>
box. Maybe someday - I don't have a GPS and am unlikely to get one soon! <br/>
