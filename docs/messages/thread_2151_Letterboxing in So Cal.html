Hello everyone, just a newbie here wanting to say hi to all and say a few <br/>
comments.<br/>
<br/>
I just recently started looking for these letterboxes with my mother and my <br/>
boyfriend.  It's really exciting to be so thrown off at first to where it <br/>
might be, and then suddenly you figure it out and see it!<br/>
<br/>
I've found all 3 left by Gwen and Don in Long Beach.  It was pretty exciting <br/>
wandering nearby Shoreline Village late at night in search of the letterbox <br/>
(Dan and I were quite awake after finding it!).  I only wish that there were <br/>
more nearby that we could find(we live in Glendale).  It'd be nice if it <br/>
also didn't involve being within a park that's closed at night, since <br/>
looking for them at night seemed so fun (and discreet too ;).<br/>
<br/>
I hope that more will pop up for us to find.  Dan and I are considering <br/>
making one...soon as we improve our stamp making skills :)<br/>
<br/>
