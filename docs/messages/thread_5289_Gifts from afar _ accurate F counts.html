&gt; &gt; Our legerdemaine count has now passed our mapsurfer count (both <br/>
in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; double digits),<br/>

is<br/>
&gt; accurate ;-)<br/>
<br/>
All you have to do is come visit us in RI and check it out yourself!<br/>
We have an entire filing cabinet full of "done" clue sheets - all <br/>
stamped, dated, and filed by month in reverse order! Of course, I <br/>
also keep a numbered F count list with me when I go out letterboxing <br/>
so I can update it by state as I go along. If you ever want to look <br/>
at it, you can see that almost half our F's are from CT! (Hurray for <br/>
those prolific CT planters! It is now possible to join the PFX 500 <br/>
Club without ever having to plant a single box, meet a single other <br/>
letterboxer, or even leave the state of Connecticut! We still happen <br/>
to think the other way of letterboxing, to get out and meet people is <br/>
more fun, though, and hopefully eliminates some of that "competitive <br/>
edge" that is not supposed to be what letterboxing is all about!!!)<br/>
At any rate, I'm sure both the mapsurfer and legerdemaine know <br/>
exactly how many of their respective boxes we have found! We may not <br/>
be able to show off ALL our stamps, because some of them <br/>
inadvertantly give away mystery locations, but you can be absolutely <br/>
sure we've found any we either SAY we've found or have been sworn to <br/>
secrecy on! As for logbooks, Pete is on his 5th, and I don't even <br/>
keep one - I'm only in it for the filing cabinet and the numbers!<br/>
(that's supposed to be a joke!)<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
