                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was not my intent to create paranoia.  I guess I was putting out a <br/>
plea for people to be a little more compassionate to those who are <br/>
less capable or well oriented. When I had my little mis-adventure I <br/>
was embarrassed about the bad descisions I made to get me into the <br/>
situation.  If I had to be rescued, you can be assured that I <br/>
wouldn't have even mentioned letterboxing.  It's a little bit <br/>
disturbing to see the sparring match this has created and the way <br/>
that people have taken it as a personal attack. <br/>
<br/>
First let me say that there's a difference between being a bleeding <br/>
heart and a compassionate person.  I get just as annoyed as anyone by <br/>
being weighted down by people who have no business doing certain <br/>
things.  That even goes back 20+ years to my scout leader days when <br/>
I'd had to stay back with a kid who wasn't capable of being on the <br/>
trail. (I was a summer camp counselor and didn't have much choice who <br/>
they gave me)  However, we have to find a happy medium.  I've heard <br/>
many people say that they won't compromise their enjoyment for some <br/>
idiot who doesn't know enough to come out of the rain.  Well, I won't <br/>
compromise human life for a lousy hobbie.  However, read on because I <br/>
think there's a way out of it. <br/>
<br/>
Read my suggestions below and think about this.  Also, check out the <br/>
below mentioned thread from April (circa 4/25).  We're going to have <br/>
to work together on this one. We'll need a little brainstorming. <br/>
<br/>
I think that there's an underlying issue we need to look at.  I <br/>
alluded to this in April in the "Letterboxing in National Parks" <br/>
thread.  We need to look at other outdoor organizations like the <br/>
Sierra Club and some of the trail organizations that are actively <br/>
doing things on public land.  If a trail club builds a shelter or a <br/>
bridge, what protects them from liability?  Their structure and <br/>
operating procedures need to be studied.<br/>
<br/>
Here's some possibilities for the sake of brainstorming:<br/>
<br/>
*If a non-profit corp. were created, it's address and phone number <br/>
could be where all the contacts go. <br/>
<br/>
* For right now placers could put this group's email address in the <br/>
box as a contact.  The person it was meant for could get the message <br/>
without a direct connection.<br/>
<br/>
Do you see where I'm going with this?  Now pick up the ball and run <br/>
with it.  <br/>

No disrespect intended, but methinks this is not the group to civilize into<br/>
a non-profit organization.  The type of organization you mention would<br/>
require capital, and oodles of bureaucracy.  We can't even manage to scrape<br/>
together enough donations to pay the bills, let alone to finance an 800<br/>
number "manned 24 hours a day for your letterboxing convenience."<br/>
<br/>
I think in this over-regulated, over-stimulated, over-paid, over-hyped<br/>
society letterboxing should be left pretty much as it is (a "lousy hobby"...<br/>
remember?).  If we allow corporations to donate (Tupperware?  Uncle<br/>
what's-his-name?), then we sell our souls for their advertising.  I'll tell<br/>
you with GREAT certainty... it ain't gonna happen!!<br/>

Speaking of this, how are the bills paid?  I assume the web site must
cost something.  Is there a mechanism in place to accept donations
to cover these costs?
