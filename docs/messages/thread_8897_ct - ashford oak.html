couldnt find it. it might have been the short time that we had for <br/>
letterboxing or the leaves that were on the ground which makes it <br/>
hard to find the tell tale blue of most letterboxes. so if anybody <br/>
knows if it has been removed or we just were good lookers at 8am <br/>
could you help us out?? and just a quick note.. we got the nipmuck <br/>
natchuag junction box today and it was in great condition. thanks... <br/>
