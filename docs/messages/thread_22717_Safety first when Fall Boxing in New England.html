attending our event or planning to box this Fall in Maine (and New <br/>
England) to be aware of the hunting seasons &amp; wear appropriate bright <br/>
attire when boxing in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
We recently became aware that some of the parks around Southern Maine <br/>
may have some limited access to hunters. One such place is the Town <br/>
Farm Forest in Kittery.It allows access to hunters in some parts. <br/>
People just should take precautions to have necessary outerware,just <br/>
in case!!<br/>
<br/>
WE want everyone to be smart &amp; safe during this Fall boxing season!<br/>
