On January 23, 1903, Connecticut purchased the first tract of land of what<br/>
was to become Connecticuts State Forest System.  In 2003, in honor of the<br/>
Centennial of the State Forest System, Connecticut DEP's Division of<br/>
Forestry invited the public to visit these State Forests, by placing a<br/>
series of letterboxes throughout the State Forests. <br/>
In 2005, due to strong public support for this first set of letterboxes, DEP<br/>
Forestry initiated a second series of letterboxes on the State Forests.  As<br/>
these second set of letterboxes are put out in the forests, they will be<br/>
placed in new locations but in the same forests.  The new boxes will<br/>
gradually replace the old boxes.<br/>
<br/>
We hope people will use these new letterboxes as a reason to come back out<br/>
to the State Forests and explore some more, and learn more about what a<br/>
valuable resources the State Forests are! <br/>
