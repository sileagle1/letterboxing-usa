Letterboxers came to Maine &amp; enjoyed each other and some FUN!<br/>
<br/>
Pictures should be up shortly. If anyone has some pictures they can<br/>
share I would love it if you can email me offline...<br/>
<br/>
On a personal note I want to thank Cooties, Oceanwytch, The End and<br/>
the always supportive Nautilus &amp; Culex....<br/>
Also those who contributed stamps, event boxes etc....Heart felt<br/>
kudos to you as well!<br/>
<br/>
Most of the boxes planted will be online shortly for people to log<br/>
in. If you have any questions please email me<br/>
<br/>
Again thank you all sooooo much!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You folks did a great job. Lots of boxes, but, most importantly, you<br/>
were friendly, welcoming, and well-organized. We enjoyed meeting those<br/>
we hadn't met before and seeing those we had.<br/>
<br/>
The amount of effort that goes into putting on events is impressive.<br/>
Carving is a great art, and so is organizing and hosting an event.<br/>
Congratulations.<br/>
