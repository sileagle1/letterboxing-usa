                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think this is a very good tool.  It certainly presents some things <br/>
to think about.  It is a good starting place.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I would use it with clarifications.  I try to make people <br/>
aware of how the trail goes and how they might fare.  We have people <br/>
here how LB with elders or very young people.  I think pointing out ( <br/>
in the rating exercise) the need to be aware of vegetation at all <br/>
levels was illuminating.<br/>
<br/>
I will try add the rating scores to my boxes along with my usual <br/>
advice.  I think LB's should be able to judge themselves what it <br/>
means to tackle a box in a rocky ravine or a 5 mile hike based on <br/>
their own self knowledge of their abilities.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I kind of appreciate knowing before I venture out what I might be<br/>
getting into.  Some days I can climb a sand dune, others I can't.  I<br/>
don't hesitate to turn back when/if I am uncomfortable with the terrain,<br/>
or anything else about the area, but it sure is disappointing.  It's<br/>
especially so, if you don't have time or energy to try another instead.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I guess I'm just a poor sport.  I enjoy the puzzle and the hike, but I<br/>
darned well expect something for the effort!  :-)  I suspect I'll<br/>
'mature' once I'm in the sport for awhile.  I'll come to appreciate even<br/>
more a stamp that took me two or three tries to find.  <br/>
