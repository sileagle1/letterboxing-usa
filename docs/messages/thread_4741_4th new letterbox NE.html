                    <div class="plaintext-content">On March 15, 2002 Funhog placed the Cottonmill Park letterbox near Kearney,<br/>
Buffalo County, Nebraska. Every year in the spring birdwatchers from all<br/>
over the country come to this town to encounter huge flocks of waterfowl,<br/>
field after field filled with hungry Sandhill Cranes and to see the show of<br/>
courting Prairie Chickens. These birds can occasionally be seen on a small<br/>
tract of native prairie land at Cottonmill Park,  just west of town. <br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: From Kearney go west on Highway 30 to Cottonmill Road.<br/>
Turn right and drive a short distance to the park entrance. Inside the<br/>
park, go to the East Shelter parking area. The Prairie Trail begins across<br/>
the road.<br/>
<br/>
to the letterbox:  Keep barbed wire on your right until you see a shelter<br/>
with a covered wagon parked beside it. One hundred fifty years ago the<br/>
travelers along the Platte River Road all had to choose between the<br/>
short-lived gold fields of California, or the long term security of the<br/>
fertile Willamette Valley of Oregon. Here you have a similar choice to<br/>
make. If you want to find this letterbox, you're in for the long haul. When<br/>
you reach the next resting place along the trail, the letterbox is perched<br/>
in a cedar tree twenty-nine steps due North.<br/>
