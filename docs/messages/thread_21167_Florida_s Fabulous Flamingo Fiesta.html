anyone who might be interested gets the word.   To those of you who wind up <br/>
getting it two or three times, I'm sorry!<br/>
<br/>
Florida's Fabulous Flamingo Fiesta, a picnic gathering for letterboxers, will <br/>
take place on February 5, 2005, at Tree Tops Park in Davie, FL.   (Fort <br/>
Lauderdale area)   For directions to the park, see the "Top o' the Trees" letterbox <br/>
on LbNA.<br/>
<br/>
Someone will be there starting at about 9 am, to hold our spot, so anytime <br/>
you want to get there after that is fine.   I think 10:30 or 11 will be our <br/>
official start time, but there are boxes in the park (and will be more for the <br/>
event) so you might want to stop by, check in, and then go hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Bring your own main course and also a dish to share, if possible.   I'm going <br/>
to make every attempt to have a grill there, so folks can cook burgers or <br/>
whatever if they want, but that's not confirmed yet.<br/>
<br/>
If possible, it'd be great if you could let me know you're coming, so I'll <br/>
have SOME idea of numbers.   If you're bringing kids, let me know that, too.   <br/>
We should have a couple of boxes carved and hidden by kids, for kids (though <br/>
adults are welcome to search for them, too!)   If, however, at the last minute, <br/>
you suddenly find out that you can come after all, come on.   Don't NOT come <br/>
just because you didn't RSVP!<br/>
<br/>
After lunch, we'll do a mass exchange, hopefully a group photo, and maybe a <br/>
few surprises.<br/>
<br/>
Any questions, I'm at: StDebb@aol.com.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to meeting all who can come!<br/>
<br/>
