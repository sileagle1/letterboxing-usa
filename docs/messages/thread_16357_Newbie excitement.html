posted that a kind geocacher who found my box emailed me and said there were <br/>
already 2 or 3 stamps in the book.  So of course I had to race over there to <br/>
see.  Since she was there, two more lovely letterboxers have visited, and one of <br/>
them says he (or she) is going to plant some more boxes in the area!  I'm <br/>
thrilled!  Not only a visit to my very first box, but more boxes for me to find <br/>
are in the works!!!<br/>

That is great news!  I wish I knew the feeling.  We have planted 3 <br/>
boxes now, but as far as I know they have not had any visitors <br/>
(except my sister and her family who we forced to find our first <br/>
box!).<br/>

I posted the above yesterday, and what do you know, I received a <br/>
message via the 'contact placer' function of the Letterbox site that <br/>
someone found our Turkey Run box!  I am so excited!!  I had better <br/>
get working on our next box . . .<br/>
