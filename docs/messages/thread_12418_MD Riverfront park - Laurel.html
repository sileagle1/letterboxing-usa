series box to it's original position.  So everyting is back the way it should <br/>
be!<br/>
<br/>
The stamps are so fun.  I did all nine boxes in the park today.  The Dam <br/>
Trail series stamps are wonderful!  And I really enjoyed the hike too.  I was <br/>
wishing that I had brought my bike for the Easter series.  That's a nice <br/>
trail.  I'll have to go back.<br/>
<br/>
People searching for these boxes should be VERY careful of poison ivy.  It is <br/>
everywhere.  Especially the last box of the Easter series - the tree that the <br/>
box is hidden in is literally COVERED in poison ivy.  Of course, I wasn't <br/>
really paying attention when I found the box - I only noticed when I went to <br/>
put the box back.  I am going to be very sad if I get poison ivy again!  I'm <br/>
just recovering from a recent run-in with the evil plant!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Chessie for some great boxes!<br/>
