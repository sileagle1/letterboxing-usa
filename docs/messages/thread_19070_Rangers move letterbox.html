We just received a contact the placer note regarding our letterbox at the Tule Elk Reserve in Kern County, Ca.(area 5)  It seems as though the letterboxer was following our original clues but things had changed. A kindly Ranger went up to her and advised that do to construction our letterbox was moved. We have since changed clues to reflect the clue change in Jenny's note as well as the Rangers' good deed. No,this is not a National Park, it is a California State facility.<br/>
