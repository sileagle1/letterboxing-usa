                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings to all who read this! I love reading through the posts <br/>
about folks adventures out there, especially since it's only every so <br/>
often that folks come to Idaho and find my boxes close to me. I <br/>
guess I live vicariously through those of you near LOTS of boxes and <br/>
even enjoy reading about adventures you share of boxes that I've <br/>
found too in the past. I say keep posts coming about your adventures <br/>
and if you're not into reading about those then you don't have to at <br/>
all. The bottom line is I want to be out there letterboxing and <br/>
learning more ideas from all of you on this site is awesome. <br/>
<br/>
I guess what I'm trying to say is I don't like all the negative stuff <br/>
or mean words written recently back and forth between some folks, but <br/>
I'm choosing to not read that stuff and LETTERBOX and hope other <br/>
folks will feel welcome as they adventure into this great sport. <br/>
<br/>
If you plant them, they will come...thank you franzsolo and cadenza <br/>
and Amanda from Seattle &amp; Ryan and DVNRCKR and Don &amp; Gwen, Silent <br/>
Doug, Heather &amp; gang, and all the <br/>
great folks I've met along the way and the ones I'll meet in the <br/>
future. Keep them coming!!! One day more folks in Boise will enjoy <br/>
this great sport too and plant some more for me to find. =-) <br/>
<br/>
All righty off to letterbox.<br/>
