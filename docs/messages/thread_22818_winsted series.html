                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to say that this series is now done and today I spoke with <br/>
the owner of the Winsted News and asked why he mentioned where the <br/>
boxes were hidden in his article and I`m happy to say that he didn`t he <br/>
was so excited about letterboxing that all he did was called the paper <br/>
to say how happy he and other merchants were about brining people to <br/>
the Laurel City. The newspaper then went on the website and after <br/>
research wrote the article. I guess you can call it freedom of speech. <br/>
I apoligize if this has hurt anyone no harm was ever intended. But then <br/>
too I don`t see where any big harm was done.   PATRIOTIC GIRL<br/>
