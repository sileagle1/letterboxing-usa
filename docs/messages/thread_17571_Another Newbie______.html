  Hello all!  Another newbie here!  I'm Melissa in WA state.  I learned about letterboxing several months ago, got all my gear, made a stamp, and have yet to go on a hunt.  Time and life events have just not allowed me too.  I'm getting antsy though, and keep searching for ones in our area (Bremerton), and noticed that there are at least 2 new ones near by.  I have 2 little boys, and they are just as excited as I.  I'm hoping, if weather permits, to go one day this week.  <br/>
