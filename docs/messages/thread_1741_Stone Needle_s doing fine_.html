Needle letterbox.  It's doing quite well under a lot of snow.  The <br/>
gift certificate is doing alright too.  It's just waiting for some <br/>
hungry soul to spirit it away to a local restaurant.  <br/>
<br/>
If you like winter sports, this is an ideal one to go for.  There's a <br/>
cross-country ski and snowshoe rental facility right nearby and the <br/>
trails are maintained.  I guess you could consider this a few more <br/>
hints.  There's not too many places like this in NJ.<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget, the 2nd to last instruction is 50 paces, not 60.  I <br/>
used true north with a 11.5 degree west declination.  When I was in <br/>
the US Forest Service I did some pacing on snowshoes.  It works <br/>
pretty well.  However, you can probably get away without them.  It's <br/>
not too far from the trails head<br/>
Try giving me a call if you get it.  My info is in the box.  If I'm <br/>
available I'll join you for a drink.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

I've been wondering about the "Needle".  Vic and I were going to <br/>
visit it on Christmas day but the snow and cold were a bit much. If I <br/>
still lived in NJ I'd have that box (and prize) by now!!<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning a trip to South Jersey next month for visiting and to <br/>
plant a box or two in Camden and Atlantic counties (weather <br/>
permitting). But yours has been haunting me---I know where to go; <br/>
just missed the opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
If I do get it, you'll be the first to know!<br/>
