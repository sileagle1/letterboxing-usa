My favorite boxes are always the Russ Clan boxes. The newspaper down here (I<br/>
believe, it was a while ago)wrote of them and that's how we were introduced<br/>
to letterboxing. They are very inventive and talented people. Their stamps<br/>
are excellent, their hiding places ingenious. They have taken us on tours of<br/>
places we never even knew existed! They also include goodies for the kids in<br/>
most boxes. If you ever make it down to southern VA you should definitely<br/>
try their boxes. The spot Green Tea is in just made us ohh and ahh in wonder<br/>
at it's beauty, and astounded us that we had never been there before!<br/>

P.S.  200 accomplished or 2000 accomplished is a really neat thing,<br/>
but I would rather hear about your top 10 letterboxing locations so I<br/>
could go visit them and share the experience you had.<br/>
