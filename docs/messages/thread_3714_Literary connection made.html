                    <div class="plaintext-content">My 7-year-old letterboxing son Dune Dude (we're a letterboxing <br/>
family) just discovered The Magic Treehouse books at the school <br/>
library.  He came home and said "Guess what, Mum?  There are books at <br/>
school *named after letterboxes*."  I had to explain that it was <br/>
actually the reverse.  He brought printouts of the letterboxes/clues <br/>
to school to tell the class about our hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Just had to share that.  Now he's psyched about finding all of them <br/>
during our annual summer interment in Narragansett.<br/>
<br/>
Conversely, my dinner companion the other evening, a native <br/>
Darmoorian, never heard of letterboxing.  Go figure.<br/>
