Welcome!  If you enjoy the outdoors, like the elements of hunting <br/>
for "treasure" and enjoy solving puzzles, then you'll like <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of things you need to get started.  The first two <br/>
are a personal journal and a signature stamp.  Most letterboxers that <br/>
I'm aware of carve their own signature stamp, but many start out with <br/>
a store-bought stamp that "defines" them, and then carve their own at <br/>
a later date.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have that, you'll need clues.  The LbNA database <br/>
(www.letterboxing.org) has the greatest source of them, but there are <br/>
plenty of other sources as well -- individual websites, word-of-<br/>
mouth, talk groups like this, etc.  Sometimes clues are handed out at <br/>
gatherings, too.<br/>
<br/>
Then, simply head out and find that letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
Before you begin, spend some time with the Letterboxing FAQ at the <br/>
LbNA website (again, www.letterboxing.org)then peruse Silent Doug's <br/>
Letterboxing site at www.letterboxing.info (note the two websites <br/>
have identical names but different domains (.com versus .info).  <br/>
Silent Doug has a great collection of articles and links that provide <br/>
a ton of information on letterboxing -- finding and placing boxes, <br/>
terminology, how to carve stamps, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Once you've looked at both of those sites, then head over to the New <br/>
Boxers group here at Yahoo! <br/>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/) where you can ask all the <br/>
remaining questions you have.  This alternate group was set up to <br/>
provide an open forum for new letterboxers to ask questions without <br/>
clogging this talk group (known as the "main" group).<br/>
<br/>
Most of all, enjoy yourself!<br/>
