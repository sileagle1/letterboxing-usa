This was our second event in western New York. The first was <br/>
informal and only had 2 teams at it. Dagonell and us. The gathering <br/>
today was a far cry from that. We had a turn out that surprised me. <br/>
At the event we had letterboxers that were out for the first time. <br/>
We also had some that were working on their count in the Thousands. <br/>
We have been letterboxing for just a year now, it is nice to see it <br/>
take off in this area. We want to give everybody a big heart felt <br/>
THANK YOU for your attendance. For those who were not able to <br/>
attend, we are sorry that we missed you. We look forward to meeting <br/>
you at the next gathering. The gathering goes down in our book as a <br/>
RED LETTER DAY. Pat and Michelle 2/5ths of Team Dakota<br/>
