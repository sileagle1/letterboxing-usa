                    <div class="plaintext-content">Rustypuff and I had a great day boxing in southern Rhode Island <br/>
today.  We didn't rebuild any stone walls or have a close encounter <br/>
with a deer (waves to Warrior Woman), but we're pretty satisfied with <br/>
our results anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Unless otherwise noted, all of the following were in place, dry, and <br/>
intact.<br/>
<br/>
Ghost Town at Sundown: Rustypuff snagged this one.  I had it already.<br/>
<br/>
Viking Ships at Sunrise: Although I'd found this box before, we both <br/>
upped our counts because the box contained a new stamp.  And quite a <br/>
stamp it is!  Nice job!<br/>
<br/>
Fast Track to Your Degree: Again, Rustypuff got the first two stamps <br/>
while I looked on.  The third box, as previously noted on the list, <br/>
is long gone.<br/>
<br/>
Green Trails Language Quest: We took a quick look around for this <br/>
one, not really expecting to find it, and were not surprised.  To the <br/>
best of my knowledge, no-one has ever posted finding it, and I <br/>
suspect that it disappeared at least two years ago.  If anyone has <br/>
found it "recently," we'd love to hear about it.<br/>
<br/>
Great Swamp Monument: We both got this and the bonus box.  ATVers <br/>
began coming up the road as we were stamping up, but immediately <br/>
turned around and ran away.  They knew they weren't supposed to be <br/>
running around back there.<br/>
<br/>
South County Bike Path: Again we praise the wisdom of Mr. Haalck in <br/>
providing multiple distance options.  <br/>
<br/>
Asa Pond: The first box needs a new silver ink pad  the one that's <br/>
there is dried out.  We were "enchanted" with the winding paths <br/>
through the shiggies.<br/>
<br/>
Coffee Break: "East is East and West is West and never the twain <br/>
shall meet," to paraphrase John Lennon, except in this clue, where <br/>
East is West.  But we found the box nevertheless.  Laurette is lucky <br/>
to have such a place to go on her coffee breaks.<br/>
<br/>
Billions of Blistering Blue Barnacles: An easy close to our <br/>
letterboxing day, and so enticingly close to Jim's Dock that we had <br/>
to stop for a dinner of chowder, clam cakes, stuffies, grilled <br/>
salmon, and Scollops Nantucket.  Yum!  The sea of beach rose on the <br/>
way to the box was fragrant and full of bunnies.<br/>
<br/>
That's it!<br/>

Woo Hoo!  I remember finding that one.  Another excuse to climb the <br/>
mountain!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the updates!  I'll be moving down in a week.<br/>

Can't wait can't wait can't wait<br/>

I snagged that one yesterday and met up with some old charterboat <br/>
captain friends.  Ahoy, matey!<br/>
<br/>
Also found Just Bass.  Now there's another gorgeous spot.  Unless Mad <br/>
Mary surfaces soon, I'll adopt Just Bass and Pt. Judith (as soon as I <br/>
figure out *where* to replant PJ).<br/>
