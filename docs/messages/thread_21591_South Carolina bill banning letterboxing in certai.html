I say this knowing full well that letterboxes (in particular) aren't<br/>
supposed to be buried and are supposed to be placed responsibly.  And<br/>
it's been my experience that placers are extremely responsible in<br/>
natural environments--but an archaeological environment is very<br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I find it sad that they'd also outlaw it on<br/>
historic sites and cemeteries that are already protected and<br/>
maintained, especially given the number of letterboxes that introduce<br/>
people to their local history and tie in to the sites where they are<br/>
placed.<br/>

geocaching.com placement rules (so are buried caches). Of course, as<br/>
some other sites have started their own geocaching databases, their<br/>
placement rules could vary by website. Letterboxing, since it doesn't<br/>
have a localized organization with a set of rules, probably is more<br/>
vulnerable to this kind of legislation.<br/>
<br/>
I think trying to outlaw these games from public cemetaries and<br/>
historical sites is a bit short-sighted, though. These are<br/>
already-prepared sites that get thousands of visitors already, not<br/>
delicate archaeological sites that are still in the process of<br/>
discovery. I know that I wouldn't have ever visited our local historic<br/>
cemetary and learned a bit more about my city if there wasn't a cache<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, few congresspeople do either, so it'll take some real<br/>
coordinated efforts to get the bill changed.<br/>

Has there been some problems with letterboxing activity in South <br/>
Carolina?  Usually a bill won't be introduced unless someone has <br/>
experienced problems and wants it stopped.  All those cosponsors <br/>
could represent districts where some organized anti-letterboxing <br/>
campaign has been run.  Who is behind the lobbying?<br/>

The cachers have been chewing on this one for a few days on their <br/>
forum. South Carolina has an active geocacher group and they are <br/>
trying to find out more info.<br/>

Apparently the author of the bill, Rep Catherine Ceips, has the <br/>
impression that geocachers and letterboxers are vandalizing  <br/>
cemeteries and archaeological sites by digging them up and removing <br/>
headstones. This came from one of the co-sponsors of the bill who is <br/>
backing it based on information received from Rep. Ceips.<br/>
<br/>
Of course we all know this is hogwash, but misperceptions like these <br/>
can severely restrict geocaching and letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
The South Carolina Geocaching Assn is working on this and they have <br/>
contacted several legislators to discuss this and dispell these <br/>
misconceptions about our sports. Its probably a good idea to hold off <br/>
on any letter writing campaign until we see how their efforts pan out.<br/>
<br/>
Its important that we nip this one in the bud, because the other <br/>
states tend have copycat legislatures and if the South Carolina <br/>
thinks something is worth legislating against, they are likely to <br/>
follow.<br/>

Nah... That'd be too logical. My question is how they would expect to enforce the <br/>
penalty, given that people rarely put their real names and addresses in the boxes.<br/>

The vandalism laws wouldn't apply because neither letterboxers nor <br/>
geocachers commit acts of vandalism. The bill exists only because a <br/>
state legislator mistakenly believes otherwise. Once a large enough <br/>
enough group of legislators learns the truth, the bill should die.<br/>
<br/>
Steve and Heidi's suggestion (teaching legislators about the hobbies)<br/>
is great and I think the local cacher group is already working on it.<br/>
