<br/>Not knowing exactly where you live, I'll tell you about some boxes in Western MA.
<br/>
<br/>The Keystone Bridge Letterbox in New Salem, MA is very nearly a drive-by. The walk to the box is very quick, over level ground. The two boxes in Bear's Den, also in New Salem, are very short walks, but the terrain is not level. There is a box at Mill River Park in Amherst, MA that is very easy, over level ground, and finally, there is a box on Mt. Pollux, also in Amherst, that is pretty easy, but the box site is covered in poison ivy, and the owner of the box recently contacted me offlist about this box, and indicated that it might be pulled out of the field for replacement.
<br/>
<br/>Good luck!

Yea - I crawled around and found the Mt. Pollux box last Sunday, and<br/>
besides the stamp I received my first case of poison ivy! It was bound to<br/>
happen now that I've started this hobby!<br/>

Not knowing exactly where you live, I'll tell you about some boxes in<br/>
Western MA.<br/>
<br/>
The Keystone Bridge Letterbox in New Salem, MA is very nearly a drive-by.<br/>
The walk to the box is very quick, over level ground. The two boxes in<br/>
Bear's Den, also in New Salem, are very short walks, but the terrain is not<br/>
level. There is a box at Mill River Park in Amherst, MA that is very easy,<br/>
over level ground, and finally, there is a box on Mt. Pollux, also in<br/>
Amherst, that is pretty easy, but the box site is covered in poison ivy,<br/>
and the owner of the box recently contacted me offlist about this box, and<br/>
indicated that it might be pulled out of the field for replacement.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>

Hi. I don't see the Keystone Bridge Letterbox directions on the site. Do<br/>
<br/>
you have them handy, or did I just miss them?<br/>

<br/>
Another drive-by letterbox, which I do not think has been mentioned yet, is<br/>
the "Tangled Woods" letterbox/cache in Upton, MA.  We just found this one a<br/>
few days ago, so I know its there.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you are going to be on Cape Cod, some of the lighthouse letterboxes<br/>
are drive-ups.  These are beautiful locations and beautiful stamps, and<br/>
would make for a memorable day! (Highland Light in Truro falls into this<br/>
category.)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!  Blue Moon<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] drive by/short walks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; A dear friend is coming to visit me next week and I would love to<br/>
&gt; introduce her to letterboxing.  However, she has had double knee<br/>
&gt; replacement surgery and has difficulty walking.  Does anyone know of<br/>
&gt; any drive by or short walk boxes in the RI/MA/CT area? It is my hope<br/>
&gt; that she'll love it, and as her knees continue to improve she'll be<br/>
&gt; able to walk greater distances.  Thanks for your help!<br/>
