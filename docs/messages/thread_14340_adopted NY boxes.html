Deliverance 05 July 03, and it was in good shape. We were in the correct <br/>
area for Monster Tamer but as it was noon and I had left my compass home, we <br/>
had no idea in which direction 70* was. I have since bought a compass just <br/>
for LBing. I hope this helps. <br/>

&gt; I've adopted the following NY boxes with permission of their owners: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Buttermilk Falls (Downstream Deliverance and Monster Tamer)<br/>
&gt; Taughannock Falls<br/>
&gt; NY Box at the Glen <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've also adopted these two Ithaca boxes, at least temporarily until the <br/>
&gt; owner claims them (no contact info is available and the owner no longer <br/>
&gt; appears to be active): <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Plantations<br/>
&gt; Sapsucker Woods <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm going to try to visit all the boxes at some point this summer to make <br/>
&gt; sure they're still in good shape. If you've been to any of these boxes in <br/>
&gt; the past few months, I'd appreciate any sort of status update you might <br/>
&gt; have. The "last reported found" date will be updated on the clue pages <br/>
&gt; after I've checked in on the boxes: <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to Jay for deleting the older clue pages for these boxes for me. <br/>
