Thank you for your 7/15/01 reply concerning the Carillon letterbox at Fort<br/>
Ti.  Sorry it has taken so long for us to reply.  Tonight was the first<br/>
night since the beginning of July that we have searched for your message.<br/>
We look forward to returning to Fort Ti to try to find the letterbox again.<br/>
<br/>
Next week our family heads up to Acadia National Park and we noticed that<br/>
you placed some letterboxes there, too!  We plan to try to find at least<br/>
three of them.  I (Lisa) grew up on Mt.Desert Island, so I know the area<br/>
well.  However, I'm not sure I'll be able to figure out the Beehive!  We<br/>
will let you know how successful we are at finding them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your reply.<br/>

Thanks for your message. Good luck with the Acadia boxes. Thunder Hole is<br/>
missing; Beehive is very hard. Cadillac and Sand Beach are not hard if you<br/>
work out the cryptic parts in advance. You may have noticed that there is a<br/>
way to check your trivia answers to Cadillac on-line; you can look at that<br/>
page without having answers given away, and I definitely recommend you do<br/>
this before you try for Cadillac.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again. Let me know how you fare.<br/>
<br/>
Tom<br/>
