Cape Cod, Massachusetts: Oyster Island.  Was it called Oyster Island <br/>
for its oyster shape or because of the local oyster industry?  I <br/>
don't know but I heard the town of Oysterville was changed to <br/>
Osterville when the fancy set moved in.  Osterville is now a pretty <br/>
little town west of Hyannis.  <br/>
<br/>
Two letterboxes.  Not a breathtaking view or spectacular park, just a <br/>
walk in the woods and nice little town.<br/>
<br/>
Drive east on Main Street past Broken Grounds on the right (maybe the <br/>
best coffee you'll ever have) and the Wimpy burger restaurant on the <br/>
left.  "I'd gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today."  Just <br/>
outside of town turn left on Old Mill Road.  After a short way on <br/>
your left is a cemetery.  Pull in and drive all the way up the hill <br/>
and park. <br/>
<br/>
Walk along in the same direction as the road and it will lead you to <br/>
a path into the woods.  Last I was there they had made dirt mounds in <br/>
front of the path to discourage vehicles.  Take the path into the <br/>
woods.  You'll continue past a smaller trail to the left and on down <br/>
to the bottom of the hill to a large intersection.  Turn left.  <br/>
Follow this to the pond.  Continue on the path around past the edge <br/>
of the pond and back into the woods.  You'll pass two large wood <br/>
bollards stuck in the path to discourage vehicles.  Just past these <br/>
is a small trail going to the left.  Stop at this intersection and <br/>
look behind you to the left.  There is a large pine there behind <br/>
which you should look under leaves and a rock.<br/>
<br/>
After stamping in, walk back and enjoy the pond.  Throw sticks in the <br/>
water for the dog.  Wander through the cemetery.  For extra credit <br/>
see if you can find Pilot, and Little Pilot the dog's white <br/>
headstones in the center of the area.<br/>
<br/>
Oyster Pearl<br/>
<br/>
Drive back towards Osterville and turn into Armstrong-Kelly Park on <br/>
the right.  Grab a snack and a drink from the market across the <br/>
street.  Enjoy walking the Trails in the back of the park.  TakeAWalk <br/>
to Heather's Hillside.  Follow the path around to the Critter's <br/>
Christmas Tree area.  Look in the back behind a small gray tree at 2 <br/>
o'clock under a rock and leaves.  This park has a lot of gardening <br/>
going on and is work in progress subject to change.  If you can't <br/>
find these letterboxes call 202-441-5412.<br/>
