Near Circleville, Ohio, Pickaway County. Difficulty: Easy.    This <br/>
letterbox was inspired by a framed print which has hung in the <br/>
living room of a dear friend for many years. The picture depicts <br/>
many "fancy" things, such as flowers, ribbons, bows etc., but what I <br/>
really like is the message it contains: that each day offers us many <br/>
gifts, but it is up to each of us to "untie the ribbons".  CLUES: Go <br/>
to the Logan Elm State Memorial Park on Rt. 361 in Pickaway County. <br/>
Start at the "Regulations" sign which is just past the gate. <br/>
Starting from a point in front of the sign, take  26 paces due north <br/>
to an oddly shaped tree. From here, go 14 paces at 15 degrees to a 2-<br/>
trunked Sycamore which has had one of its trunks broken off. The <br/>
letterbox is hidden in the hollowed out part of the broken trunk <br/>
under some bark and a few rocks.<br/>
