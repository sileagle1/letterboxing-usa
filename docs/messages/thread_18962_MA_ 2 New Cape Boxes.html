I'm so bummed I didn't know about letterboxing when our family camped in CT &amp; MA 2 summers ago, incl. Cape Cod all the way to Ptown... esp. when I hear you all going on about lighthouse boxes.  We camped right by one-- Highland Light.  I don't even want to know if there was a box there!   I climbed and photographed every one I could, and never knew there were boxes hiding amongst them as well.  Aaaargh.  Well, I'll be back!  --lunaryakketyact<br/>

Those sound like some cool stamps! I had no idea it had been that <br/>
long. You've got to hand it to Ernie, 35 years of oatmeal and paper <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Those sound really cool.  Also, your explanation makes sense of my <br/>
confusion.  I couldn't figure out why someone would carve two stamps <br/>
of their own relationship that had two start dates.  Unless your <br/>
including re-incarnation or being born again or something.  Anyway, <br/>
hopefully we'll make that far down the cape this summer.  After the <br/>
long drive with kids just to reach the cape, we don't usually make <br/>
it much past Falmouth or Mashpee.  I found some clues for boxes in <br/>
those areas so I can't wait for our next trip.  I think we will <br/>
escape the chaos of Motorcycle weekend in NH and find some <br/>
letterboxes on the cape.  Congrats again.<br/>
