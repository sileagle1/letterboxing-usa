I had such a good time finding your Long Beach State letterboxes (on <br/>
7/5/03).  The first two, "49er Mascot of CSULB," and "Catching Some <br/>
Sun In The Quad," at over two years old are by far the oldest <br/>
letterboxes in my stamp book.  When I pulled the "Catching Some <br/>
Sun..." letterbox from its hiding place, it was covered by snails.  <br/>
As for your newer (planted 10/29/02) Cal State letterbox, "The Real <br/>
49er," I'm proud to say that after more than 9 months planted, I'm <br/>
the first stamp.  The clue to this one is very tricky, but that makes <br/>
it all the more fun to find.<br/>
<br/>
Last Sunday, I went after your "Seal Beach Town Tour."  Decoding your <br/>
clues was brutal; I'm sure it was just as brutal writing them.  But I <br/>
can't think of a better place to be sitting in front of historic <br/>
plaques for 20 minutes at a time on a sunny day in August then in <br/>
this lovely beach town.  I spent all day and found all of your LBs, <br/>
and even had time to take a side trip to find a nearby Mystery Box <br/>
planted by another LBer (mums the word).  This after arriving at the <br/>
pier at 7:30 AM, and having a mid-day break in an Irish Pub on Main <br/>
Street.  I was 2nd stamp in all of your letterboxes save one, in <br/>
which I was 1st stamp"Fish In The Reads"!  Congratulations on your <br/>
100th place!!  Your "Smooth Sailing On 101" was my 50th find.<br/>

I hope that someone has not taken some pages out of "The Real 49er" <br/>
log book. When Jelly and I found it it in May it had a couple of <br/>
LBers who had found it before us?<br/>
<br/>
Hey have you checked out California Bears new group for So.Cal boxers?<br/>
Check back in recent threads he has the link in a past post.<br/>
We have had a hard time keeping up with this group, so we changed our <br/>
setting and are getting a digest of the posts from this group. We are <br/>
also getting the posts from the other group. We feel we stay better <br/>
informed on our area and are able to keep up with the USA group.<br/>
<br/>
Seal Beach Town Tour was brutal, we loved it, just wish we had more <br/>
time. We are going to attempt the rest. Good job on your efforts.<br/>
Take care, Jam n Jelly<br/>
<br/>
