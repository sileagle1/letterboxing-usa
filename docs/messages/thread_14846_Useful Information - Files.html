                    <div class="plaintext-content">I created a couple of quickie documents, one with some basic terms <br/>
and acronyms, and the other with information regarding carving <br/>
materials and sources.  I uploaded these files to a folder called "A <br/>
Folder of Useful Information."<br/>
<br/>
These certainly are not meant to take the place of the FAQ, and I <br/>
directed people to the FAQ section on the letterboxing.org site for <br/>
more information.<br/>
<br/>
Just thinking this might help with some of the more redundant <br/>
questions to the list from new members.  If anyone is opposed to <br/>
these files, let me know and I will delete them. <br/>
