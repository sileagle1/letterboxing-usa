<br/>
The response have been fantastic and I have put the names into the database, getting everything ready to go... I've not received any responses requesting the peoples trail names not be associated with a state.  In that vein, please, if you do not want the state indicated on the interactive map tracking the progress of this PLB, please, please send me an email, offlist at XrayvenhausX@XmyndworxX.XcomX (Remove the 'X's from that address) and let me know before Dec 1st, 2003.<br/>
<br/>
Now, off to the question........  What do you folks think of these two possibilities?<br/>
<br/>
The first is to send to box of, helter skelter across country by the order of the receipt of the request to be placed on the list. In other words, I create the list of names, in the order that I received the request which means the box could go from one coast to the other coast, back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
The second is to group the names together by state and start in one area of the country and send it off to that 'state' to each person residing in that state, one after the other, then on to the next state, to each person in that state, one after the other, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
I'm building the list now and adding the finishing touches to the box and getting everything ready to ship, creating the logbook and making a permanent shipping box for the letterbox to be housed in so that all anyone has to do it rewrap it in, plain paper or whatever, address it and send it off.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know which way you think it should be sent out!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to your response.<br/>

I like hte helter-skelter idea.  HTat way Iget to see stamps that i might<br/>
not otherwise.  Heck, how often do I get out to the Pacific Coast?  OR the<br/>
Atlantic Coast for htat matter?  I am much more likely to see local stamps.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion, lol.<br/>
