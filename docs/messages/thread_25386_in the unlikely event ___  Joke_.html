                    <html><body><p>Now that I have looked at the Event, methinks Sir Randy is playing a delayed April Fools joke on us.  For those of us who have been around awhile you know this wouldn't be the first time (see 2004 archives of this List).  It is a sad indication of the state of this List that we did not even notice the joke (or post about it here) and had to be prodded by the perpetrator.  Please forgive our complacency.<br/><br/>Of course it could be legit, or even a clue to a new Mapsurfer letterbox.  I hope some people that live close do go and report back to us.  Tom, if you go, have a beer for me and toast the good old days!<br/><br/>Silver Eagle</p></body></html>
