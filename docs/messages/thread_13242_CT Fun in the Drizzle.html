to Coventry today despite the gray skies to get boxes we were <br/>
missing. Got everything but the DEP. It was a good thing that my <br/>
neighbor has good "Irish Roots" and could translate for us for <br/>
Irish Tinker's good new one!<br/>
Katie got 17, which is great for a new letterboxer.<br/>
Our final stop was Eagle Eyes where it POURED on us, but it <br/>
was still fun (of course!). See you all on the trails.<br/>
