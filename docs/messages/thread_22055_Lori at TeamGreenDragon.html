Actually, it is Lori's place as group moderator to make exactly that<br/>
type of request. I have nothing against PLBs - I'm in 3 rings right<br/>
now, but I agree that other than occasional posts directing new<br/>
members to visit the PLB group to sign up for a new ring, we would<br/>
prefer not to have PLB posts on the main list.<br/>

Thanks for your email.  I respect your position, however, the problem with emails is that the tone is never heard - so a mail recipient can only interpret an email on its face value.  That being said, Lori's emails appear to be somewhat condescending.  There is a much nicer way to entice people to move their emails, if Lori is so particular about booting off any PLB messages on this list.  How about something like "Although this list is letterbox-usa, perhaps your goal might be better served listing PLBs on the postal_letterboxing list?"  It's all about manners and being polite in my book.  But I do have to ask - what is the harm of posting on this list?  Doesn't a person have the right to post on whatever list they choose?  After all, this is America.<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice day.  Betsy Ross<br/>

&gt; in 3 rings right<br/>
&gt; now, but I agree that other than occasional posts<br/>
&gt; directing new<br/>
&gt; members to visit the PLB group to sign up for a new<br/>
&gt; ring, we would<br/>
&gt; prefer not to have PLB posts on the main list.<br/>

&gt; the tone is never heard - so a mail recipient can only interpret an<br/>
&gt; email on its face value.<br/>
<br/>
To a degree, this might be true, but I thought Lori's e-mail sounded<br/>
polite and didn't think twice about it. Rather, in this case, the<br/>
problem sounds like someone is taking the suggestion far too<br/>
personally and is feeling defensive. It happens--it's human nature.<br/>
It's also, sadly, human nature to think the worst in people, and<br/>
whenever someone sees a post, they tend to read the worst into it<br/>
instead of the best.<br/>
<br/>
If I wanted to, I could even read into your post a very condescending<br/>
message. When people say "I respect your position", it usually means<br/>
just the opposite. It sounds condescending--like you're trying to make<br/>
an extra effort to be polite but don't really mean it just to show<br/>
everyone else up. "Neener, neener, neener, I'm better than you because<br/>
I 'respect' your position. Take that!"<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How about something like "Although this list is letterbox-usa,<br/>
&gt; perhaps your goal might be better served listing PLBs on the<br/>
&gt; postal_letterboxing list?" <br/>
<br/>
That's just ambiguous. It sounds like a suggestion. Annoucements for<br/>
postal boxes DO NOT BELONG on this board. There's already a board for<br/>
such messages and it should be used. With a vague statement like that,<br/>
someone is likely to think it's okay to post announcements on both<br/>
boards. Why is beating around the bush considered polite? I'd rather<br/>
someone be direct and to the point. I don't have time to waste with<br/>
wishy-washy statements that never actually get to the point in question.<br/>
<br/>
And, in fact, it didn't even work. The person continued posting about<br/>
postal boxes in the incorrect location. Perhaps a more sternly worded<br/>
message would have made the concept more clear--just the opposite of<br/>
what you're suggesting.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But I do have to ask - what is the harm of posting on this list?<br/>
<br/>
Because there's a lot of people here who care nothing about postal<br/>
boxes and don't want to be bothered with posts about them. If you<br/>
think there's nothing annoying about someone pushing their views onto<br/>
you, think about that the next time someone tries preaching to you<br/>
about something you do not believe in.<br/>
<br/>
Using logic like that, I could post about how I think the Tailban is<br/>
"misunderstood" and the attack on the World Trade Center was<br/>
justified. What's the harm of posting here? It's a free country and we<br/>
have the right to post whatever we want on the list. As you said,<br/>
after all, this is America.<br/>
<br/>
The problem, though, is such a topic does not belong on this board.<br/>
Perhaps on another board it IS an okay topic, but on this board it is<br/>
not. Same thing goes for postal boxes. There's an appropriate place to<br/>
post announcements of new postal boxes--and this isn't it.<br/>
<br/>
There's always someone who'll line up to post an inappropriate<br/>
message, however, and that's an excellent opportunity to educate that<br/>
person and anyone else reading the board about the correct location<br/>
for the topic in question. But then to keep posting about something<br/>
even after a moderator says--rather politely, I thought--that the<br/>
subject is better discussed on another board is like a slap in the<br/>
face to the person who's just trying to help.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm following this thread and thinking it's just so stupid.<br/>
Someone posted to the wrong board--so what? They've been corrected and<br/>
we can get on with a happy, uncluttered life. Why are people dwelling<br/>
on *how* something was said. The content of a message is always more<br/>
important than *how* it was said. It's not personal and never has been.<br/>

And, in fact, it didn't even work. The person continued posting about<br/>
postal boxes in the incorrect location. Perhaps a more sternly worded<br/>
message would have made the concept more clear--just the opposite of<br/>
what you're suggesting.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But I do have to ask - what is the harm of posting on this list?<br/>
<br/>
Because there's a lot of people here who care nothing about postal<br/>
boxes and don't want to be bothered with posts about them. If you<br/>
think there's nothing annoying about someone pushing their views onto<br/>
you, think about that the next time someone tries preaching to you<br/>
about something you do not believe in.<br/>
<br/>
Using logic like that, I could post about how I think the Tailban is<br/>
"misunderstood" and the attack on the World Trade Center was<br/>
justified. What's the harm of posting here? It's a free country and we<br/>
have the right to post whatever we want on the list. As you said,<br/>
after all, this is America.<br/>
<br/>
The problem, though, is such a topic does not belong on this board.<br/>
Perhaps on another board it IS an okay topic, but on this board it is<br/>
not. Same thing goes for postal boxes. There's an appropriate place to<br/>
post announcements of new postal boxes--and this isn't it.<br/>
<br/>
There's always someone who'll line up to post an inappropriate<br/>
message, however, and that's an excellent opportunity to educate that<br/>
person and anyone else reading the board about the correct location<br/>
for the topic in question. But then to keep posting about something<br/>
even after a moderator says--rather politely, I thought--that the<br/>
subject is better discussed on another board is like a slap in the<br/>
face to the person who's just trying to help.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm following this thread and thinking it's just so stupid.<br/>
Someone posted to the wrong board--so what? They've been corrected and<br/>
we can get on with a happy, uncluttered life. Why are people dwelling<br/>
on *how* something was said. The content of a message is always more<br/>
important than *how* it was said. It's not personal and never has been.<br/>

No, I spent about a page dwelling on how utterly useless it is to to<br/>
dwell on how things are being said. I also provided examples for why I<br/>
thought it's such an idiotic thing to be concerned about--in an<br/>
e-mail, just like real life, you can read almost anything between the<br/>
lines. Instead of trying to read between the lines, I think focusing<br/>
on the lines themselves would be more advantageous.<br/>

And that's why Lori politely pointed to the postal letterbox board.<br/>
This thread only started to get out of control when people didn't take<br/>
kindly to the advice. Moderators expect off-topic posts on occasion<br/>
and won't hold grudges about it--but a good moderator will take<br/>
corrective action to ensure everyone is properly educated when such a<br/>
mistake happens so it won't happen again.<br/>

&gt; Hi Choi.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Thanks for your email.  I respect your position, however, the <br/>
problem with emails is that the tone is never heard - so a mail <br/>
recipient can only interpret an email on its face value.  That being <br/>
said, Lori's emails appear to be somewhat condescending.  There is a <br/>
much nicer way to entice people to move their emails, if Lori is so <br/>
particular about booting off any PLB messages on this list.  How <br/>
about something like "Although this list is letterbox-usa, perhaps <br/>
your goal might be better served listing PLBs on the <br/>
postal_letterboxing list?"  It's all about manners and being polite <br/>
in my book.  But I do have to ask - what is the harm of posting on <br/>
this list?  Doesn't a person have the right to post on whatever list <br/>
they choose?  After all, this is America.<br/>

that<br/>

&gt; now, but I agree that other than occasional posts directing new<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; To a degree, this might be true, but I thought Lori's e-mail <br/>
sounded<br/>
&gt; polite and didn't think twice about it. Rather, in this case, the<br/>
&gt; problem sounds like someone is taking the suggestion far too<br/>
&gt; personally and is feeling defensive. It happens--it's human nature.<br/>
&gt; It's also, sadly, human nature to think the worst in people, and<br/>
&gt; whenever someone sees a post, they tend to read the worst into it<br/>
&gt; instead of the best.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I wanted to, I could even read into your post a very <br/>
condescending<br/>
&gt; message. When people say "I respect your position", it usually <br/>
means<br/>
&gt; just the opposite. It sounds condescending--like you're trying to <br/>
make<br/>
&gt; an extra effort to be polite but don't really mean it just to show<br/>
&gt; everyone else up. "Neener, neener, neener, I'm better than you <br/>
because<br/>
&gt; I 'respect' your position. Take that!"<br/>

&gt; &gt; How about something like "Although this list is letterbox-usa,<br/>
&gt; &gt; perhaps your goal might be better served listing PLBs on the<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; That's just ambiguous. It sounds like a suggestion. Annoucements <br/>
for<br/>
&gt; postal boxes DO NOT BELONG on this board. There's already a board <br/>
for<br/>
&gt; such messages and it should be used. With a vague statement like <br/>
that,<br/>
&gt; someone is likely to think it's okay to post announcements on both<br/>
&gt; boards. Why is beating around the bush considered polite? I'd <br/>
rather<br/>
&gt; someone be direct and to the point. I don't have time to waste with<br/>
&gt; wishy-washy statements that never actually get to the point in <br/>
question.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; Well Ryan, you spent about a page dwelling on *how* things are being<br/>
&gt; said.<br/>
<br/>
No, I spent about a page dwelling on how utterly useless it is to to<br/>
dwell on how things are being said. I also provided examples for why I<br/>
thought it's such an idiotic thing to be concerned about--in an<br/>
e-mail, just like real life, you can read almost anything between the<br/>
lines. Instead of trying to read between the lines, I think focusing<br/>
on the lines themselves would be more advantageous.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; In looking at the description of this list at the yahoogroups site,<br/>
&gt; maybe I'm totally missing it, but I see no easily found information<br/>
&gt; that postal boxes *must* be restricted to their own group and not<br/>
&gt; discussed here.<br/>
<br/>
And that's why Lori politely pointed to the postal letterbox board.<br/>
This thread only started to get out of control when people didn't take<br/>
kindly to the advice. Moderators expect off-topic posts on occasion<br/>
and won't hold grudges about it--but a good moderator will take<br/>
corrective action to ensure everyone is properly educated when such a<br/>
mistake happens so it won't happen again.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I also see no clearly identifiable information right on the<br/>
&gt; yahoogroups homepage for this list as to just who the moderators<br/>
&gt; are.<br/>
<br/>
If you click on the "Members" option on the group, then select the<br/>
"Moderator" tab, you'll see a list of all the moderators.<br/>
