P and I (we are M&amp;P when we box together, and either M or P when we box <br/>
separately) spotted them in NJ. We two duos were hiking the same 5-box <br/>
loop, but never got close enough to say hello. Anyway, by checking log <br/>
books and license plates, we figured out who we all are. Consequently, Pete <br/>
and I, and maybe Priscilla and Wanda, have been listing "sightings" or "S". <br/>

Isn't it nice to play a sport that has such flexible rules.  Mary, M of M&amp;P<br/>
