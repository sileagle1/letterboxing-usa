Good to hear from you! You know me, if you title the email "No <br/>
comments please" I just have to comment ;-)<br/>
<br/>
After hearing Randy and your arguements about the possible abuse of <br/>
allowing open commments on a listing of letterboxes, I tend to agree <br/>
that the risks outweigh the benifits. The problem I was trying to <br/>
address is what I perceive to be the exponentially increasing <br/>
difficulty of getting some idea what boxes are still live out there. <br/>
I remember Graham spoke of this problem in the UK and I would be <br/>
interested in finding out what they are currently doing about it <br/>
(apart from assuming boxes over X numbers of years of age are dead).<br/>
<br/>
For the moment let's take the case of people who plant letterboxes in <br/>
areas they will not soon visit again (such as my South Carolina <br/>
letterbox). If someone were to ask me next year whether it is still <br/>
alive after a big storm comes close to the coast, I would have no <br/>
idea. It is in such a remote area of the country that someone would <br/>
have to expend considerable effort to go there unless they were <br/>
locals. There is no certain way to know any box is there at any given <br/>
time. However, I think that status updates by the box owner would be <br/>
very helpful. For example, although I might not visit my SC letterbox <br/>
again soon, I have placed postcards in there and could update my <br/>
listing when someone sends me one or tells me they have found it. <br/>
Upon reflection, in the future I think I will include a request in <br/>
all my clues for people to send me an email note whenever they look <br/>
for my boxes and let me know what happened. I can then choose to <br/>
update the status of any of my boxes based upon the feedback I <br/>
receive. The essential point being that the box owner chooses whether <br/>
to make the status info available and updates it themselves. Thoughts?<br/>

Lets be clear.  The clue writer is free to add any comments, data, content,<br/>
revisions, etc, they wish about _their_ box.  I hope this issue was never<br/>
in debate.<br/>

We agree completely on this point!<br/>

Now while we are on a roll, if we could only just get Bush and Gore <br/>
