Horsetail Falls at Sugarloaf Ridge State Park<br/>
Placed April 2001.<br/>
1 easy mile: our children loved it. Sorry, no dogs or mountain bikes.<br/>
Sugarloaf Ridge is a terrific park with varied landscape and habitat.<br/>
<br/>
On California Rte. 12 east of Santa Rosa, turn north on Adobe Canyon <br/>
Rd at Landmark Vineyards.<br/>
<br/>
Park on the left just inside the park 2 miles from the highway and <br/>
hike east uphill on the park road for 1/4 mile to the Canyon Trail on <br/>
your right.<br/>
<br/>
Follow through redwood and over bridge to a fork by some steps. Head <br/>
a short way south to enjoy the waterfall, and then return to the fork <br/>
and head east. Climb up 18 steps to pass between sentinel redwoods <br/>
and check the south side for your reward.<br/>
<br/>
Valley of the Moon<br/>
In February of 2003, we were fortunate enough to add to the Sugarloaf <br/>
Ridge letterboxes. This new loop will add another 5 miles to the <br/>
Horsetail Falls letterbox. The hills are moderate but the distance <br/>
isn't really appropriate for your younger kids. Again, sorry, but <br/>
dogs and bikes are too hard on these sensitive trails. Best wishes <br/>
and many thanks to the informative and very friendly park ranger <br/>
(sorry, we've forgotten your name!) who gave us permission to <br/>
letterbox here.<br/>
<br/>
After stamping in at the sentinel redwoods, continue up to the top of <br/>
the Canyon Trail. A short way further up the road, you'll find the <br/>
ranger station and a wonderful visitor's center. Bear right to the <br/>
campground and walk all the way through to the eastern end. <br/>
<br/>
Cross a bridge and walk past the amphitheater on the Creekside Nature <br/>
Trail. Crossing another bridge, connect with the Hillside Trail, and <br/>
bear right for a counter-clockwise loop around the lower part of the <br/>
park. (If this bridge is closed, as it was during our visit, you can <br/>
find the Hillside Trail east of the park buildings on your left). <br/>
<br/>
Hike up the Hillside Trail, bypassing the right-hand return loop of <br/>
the Creekside Nature Trail. You'll pass the prettiest little picnic <br/>
spot with views west. <br/>
<br/>
About one mile along, find the junction of the Meadow Trail and the <br/>
Bushy Peaks Trail. Bear left on the Meadow Trail. Passing by the Gray <br/>
Pine Trail, cross the creek on a substantial bridge and pass some <br/>
picnic benches to find the next culvert that passes under the trail. <br/>
<br/>
Look in the upstream side, in the southeast edge at trailside, under <br/>
a pumice-y basalt stone for the Valley of the Moon letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Wilikos<br/>
Continue west down the Meadow Trail to the Ferguson Observatory. <br/>
Cross the front porch to find the Meadow Trail continuing up a little <br/>
rise. Bear north onto the Lower Bald Mountain Trail and climb. We saw <br/>
deer, coyotes, Cooper's Hawk, and not another soul. It was wonderful. <br/>
<br/>
About  mile through chappral, California Black Oak, and Manzanitas, <br/>
you'll find the paved Bald Mountain Trail. <br/>
<br/>
Have a seat! The Wilikos Village letterbox is just behind you: take <br/>
three steps down the rocks to find it.<br/>
<br/>
Pony Gate Gulch<br/>
It's almost all downhill from here. Head west downhill on the Bald <br/>
Mountain Trail to the T, then south on the Stern Trail to a wonderful <br/>
benched overlook. <br/>
<br/>
Turn west onto the Pony Gate Trail and soon bear northwest on the <br/>
main path, away from a connector trail (leads to the visitor's center <br/>
at the top of the Canyon Trail). Continue downhill for about 1/3 mile <br/>
to the seasonally substantial Pony Gate Creek. <br/>
<br/>
To find this watercourse, you'll come out from cool shady California <br/>
Bay Trees (crush the long slender leaves in your hand and inhale them <br/>
for a delight: I have carried the leaves from the trees on this trail <br/>
in my wallet for 30 years, replenishing the supply annually) into an <br/>
open field with black oak on the north-northeast. <br/>
<br/>
One hundred yards later you'll step down some eroded 4X4 steps to a <br/>
switch-back that crosses a rivulet, turning from north to west-<br/>
southwest.<br/>
Immediately down some better steps, you'll find another switchback <br/>
(north to south) and the often-swiftly flowing creek. <br/>
<br/>
Cross over and then look in the center ring of a many-trunked bay <br/>
tree just off trail on the right for the Pony Gate Gulch letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing, the Pony Gate presents one last little hill climb before <br/>
spilling out onto the park road. A short way downhill, your car <br/>
awaits. Thanks for visiting our hometown trails! <br/>

another reason to visit the wine country (besides visiting family in <br/>

You picked a great time to go back home! I measured the melting snow <br/>
and it's still 6 inches deep. <br/>
    I get depressed reading this board with everyone listing their <br/>
successful finds. I NEED TO GO HUNTING! (Much need for a l'box fix)<br/>

can start planting some letterboxes later this year. I've lived here <br/>
