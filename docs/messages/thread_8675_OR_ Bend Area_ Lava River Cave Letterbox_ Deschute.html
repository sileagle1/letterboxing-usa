<br/>
Level of Difficutly:<br/>
Clues- easy<br/>
Trail- moderate, some rocks and tricky stepping at times. Most of the trail is on hard packed sand.  We must mention this disclaimer, however:  THIS ADVENTURE IS NOT FOR THE CLOSTERPHOBIC OR THOSE WHO FEAR THE DARK.  This letterbox is hidden over 100 feet underground and appx 1/2 mile down a trail in a lava cave.  If you fear small spaces or have  a great fear of the dark this is not for you.  However, it is a wonderful adventure for those who dare.<br/>
Distance- appx 1 1/2 mile round trip if you go all the way to the end of the cave.  The cave actually continues further for those who dare to crawl under the low hanging ceiling beyond walking areas.  Again, not for those who fear dark closed in spaces.<br/>
<br/>
Advice-  TAKE FLASHLIGHTS OR LANTERNS AND EXTRA BATTERIES/FUEL.  This cave is pitch black, blacker than black, not a hint of light, darker than dark, dark, DARK!!! Kind of spooky for adults, really scary for children (although our kids enjoyed it as long as they were close to the flashlights).<br/>
Also, take warm clothes as the temperature stays a constant 42 degrees underground.<br/>
<br/>
Cost:  12 and under- FREE<br/>
13-17 $2.50<br/>
Adults $3.00<br/>
Lantern Rental $2.00<br/>
Open from mid April (depending on ice) thru mid October<br/>
