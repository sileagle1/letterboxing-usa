&gt; If you want kids to use water-soluble ink, you don;t need to worry about the<br/>
&gt;  durability of the PAPER or the INK. YOu need to worry about the water-<br/>
&gt;  tightness of the CONTAINER!!!!!!  If the container is adequate, the rest is<br/>
&gt;  cake!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Hoggie Dearest makes a very valid point.  It's the containers that matter most<br/>
of all.<br/>
<br/>
Of course everyone is free to use whatever paper, inks, and containers they<br/>
prefer.   Personally, I haven't given up on Deborah's idea of using recycled<br/>
coffee and peanut butter jars.  Granted, the smell will probably be impossible<br/>
to wash completely away, but I doubt that anything short of a bear will be<br/>
able to do much damage to them.  I at least intend to put the idea to the<br/>
test.  Since Western Oregon is populated by bears, coons, cougars, and other<br/>
wild critters, and I have a tendency to like to hide my letterboxes in wooded<br/>
areas, I'm sure I will soon discover the worst that Ol' Mama Nature can dish<br/>
out.  In particular, I thought this idea would make a good container<br/>
suggestion for the Kids Corner.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the wild critter test, another container test that I have no trouble<br/>
conducting is the rain test.  We don't get much in the way of freezing temps<br/>
up here in Portland, but, by God, we do get plenty of rain.  It rains for a<br/>
hundred days at a time up here... in fact, it rains for about 2/3 of the<br/>
year!!  This winter has been one of the wettest.<br/>
<br/>
I've had several letterboxes out all through our monsoon season.  All my boxes<br/>
are rectangular Rubbermade containers varying in size from about 4x6 to 6x10<br/>
inches.  The contents are always sealed in ziplock bags, and then placed in<br/>
the boxes.  Actually, I have 3 boxes that haven't been checked recently, and<br/>
another one that disappeared.  But of the other three that I've checked, there<br/>
has been absolutely NO damage from water or humidity.  Two of these, in<br/>
particular, have been directly exposed to the rain, in that they are lying on<br/>
the ground with minimal cover.  One (which is in the vicinity of a large<br/>
waterfall) even had moss growing on the outside, but there wasn't a trace of<br/>
moisture on the book or the info sheets I had included.  No mold, no smeared<br/>
ink, no condensation.<br/>
<br/>
I plan to check the other three soon.  One of these, in particular, has also<br/>
been exposed to direct rainfall, and likely has had several days where it was<br/>
under water.  I'll let you all know what I find.  Thus far, however, I'm very<br/>
pleased with the performance of the Rubbermaid/Ziplock combination.  I believe<br/>
Erik once mentioned that he had a box of similar construction that survived a<br/>
flood.<br/>

&gt;  Those [containers] that are a hard crystal<br/>
&gt;  clear plastic are probably made of polystyrene, <br/>
&gt;  and that is the bad kind of plastic that with time<br/>
&gt;  will react with [vinyl] erasers and cause them to<br/>
&gt;  desintegrate. The word is that shielding the stamp<br/>
&gt;  with paper is enough to protect it, though. <br/>
<br/>
Or... say, maybe... a Ziplock bag??  (No, I don't work for the Ziplock<br/>
people!!... but maybe I should...)<br/>

Peace and Love,<br/>
