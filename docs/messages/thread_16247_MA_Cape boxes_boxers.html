this weekend as a leader for the Boy Scout's MassJam event, (be <br/>
forewarned ... LOTS of SCOUTS) and have already received the OK from <br/>
the scoutmaster to steal away on Sat and/or Sunday to go boxing for a <br/>
few (4-5 heehee) hours:) so time will be at a premium.  I HATE to <br/>
single out any boxes because I'd love to do them all.. but.... if <br/>
anyone had any favorites, ie, beautiful sights, quiet trails, I'd <br/>
love to hear from you(off-list of course;). And also, if anyone wants <br/>
to do a "trail exchange" maybe we could work something out?     Kstar<br/>

  Too bad that you missed the Caper.<br/>
     It seemes that there will be a lot of boxers out and about this <br/>
weekend. But I would say that any Cape Box is a good box. Theer are <br/>
a few boxes that have been recentally planted that I myself might go <br/>
on a hunt for. Catch you on the trails....<br/>
