<br/>
We were up to Mt. Pistapaug yesterday to look for the Forget me Not Letterbox and believe it may have been taken.  We saw an obvious pile of rocks (it sort of looked like a little well!) next to a four branched tree, but when we looked inside we only saw a frozen glass jug and bottle!  We hesitated to try to pry the bottles loose to look under them for obvious reasons, but suspect there was nothing there anyways.  If there was another pile of rocks we didn't see it under the snow, but will get back out there sometimes after snow melt.  However, if that was the right pile, we, naturally won't bother--unless, of course, you replace it!  It was a really nice spot in either case, very pretty--<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

correct as we bring two compasses with us to make certain. I will, <br/>
indeed, check it out and post to the site and if it is missing-it <br/>
will be replaced for sure. I have more to put up there :-) Many <br/>

<br/>
Thanks for responding.  Oh, it sounds like it may still be there, then.  We don't use a compass (not as yet, anyways!) so we can never be sure we are at the "exact" point; the proof is in the found box!  But, of course, this time of year, the exact point cannot always be seen or often found under several inches of snow!  We will plan to get out there again sometime after the spring then, unless we see that you have posted otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

   Aili and I found the Forget me Not box today. We also found the <br/>
"bottle cache", you missed the box by about six feet. <br/>
