We're new to letterboxing, just found it and haven't actually had <br/>
time to go out hunting yet (hopefully this weekend!).  <br/>
<br/>
What is a hitchhiker?  I've tried looking in the archives, but <br/>
haven't found anything that explains what they are and how they work <br/>
(?)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks from yet another newbie!  (we hope to plant our own letterbox <br/>
once we figure out a good spot).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Thanks!   I hadn't had a chance to read the whole website so of <br/>
course I hadn't seen this yet (and sorry to clutter the group with <br/>
yet another redundant question!  guess I'm a product of our impulsive <br/>
society wanting an immediate answer!).  We'll keep our eyes open for <br/>
HHs - now we know what they are!   <br/>
