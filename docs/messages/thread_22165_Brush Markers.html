                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I am new to letterboxing and still learning, but I have now <br/>
learned one lesson I think should be platered across all the FAQ's <br/>
and websites and Tips lists.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is out there and I somehow just missed it, but I'm not <br/>
sure.<br/>
<br/>
When I started I went out and bought an ink pad.  So, for a few <br/>
months now everything has been getting stamped in black ink.  I do my <br/>
best to clean the stamp, but even after my best efforts some black <br/>
residue remains.  Maybe I'm using the wrong kind of ink or the wrong <br/>
pad or not the right cleaner, who knows.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I received a PLB the other day and it included something called <br/>
a brush marker.  I used that to color the stamp and voila, a great <br/>
image in a color other than black.  Then, using just water I wiped <br/>
the stamp and it came completely clean.<br/>
<br/>
I rushed out and bought 6 of these markers in the rainbow colors and <br/>
tried them out on some new stamps I carved.  Great images and <br/>
absolutely no residue.  This is great!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure all of you old hands already know all of this, but no one <br/>
told me, or if they did it wasn't obvious enough for me to not miss <br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
So for all you newbies and all you people advising and mentoring, <br/>
IMHO I think we should tell everyone about ink and marker options <br/>
ASAP.  This will protect some stamps out there as well as make their <br/>
lives easier.<br/>

They get real expensive when your 2 year old continues to find them and uses them to color on the driveway and hardwood floor when you are not looking.  I will be the first to say that markers do not last long when used on concrete or most any floor surface.<br/>

what is the difference between a brush marker and a (cheaper) felt-<br/>
