<br/>
Last week I heard about Letterboxing in an article in the Attache magazine <br/>
that you find on most US Airlines flights. I was immediately interested and <br/>
last weekend I hand carved my own personal stamp and went in search of my <br/>
first letterbox (one of only two in the Jacksonville, FL area). I pulled up <br/>
the clue for the Bald Cypress Letterbox on the LBNA website and started <br/>
hunting. Much to my dismay, it was missing. I'm almost certain I found the <br/>
correct location as the clues were very straight forward. I also tried to <br/>
alert Jeff and Juliana who placed the box May 20th, 2001 that their box may <br/>
be missing but their email address is no longer active.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone please let me know if the Bald Cypress Letterbox in <br/>
Jacksonville, FL is indeed missing or if I just couldn't find it? Right now, <br/>
all I have from my first search is a picture of an animal hole where a box <br/>
should be and at least 20 mosquito bites.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for the St. Augustine Lighthouse letterbox (which is the only <br/>
other letterbox in my area) this weekend, hope I can find it!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you &amp; Happy Hunting!<br/>
<br/>

be missing (I can't confirm that, since I had not hunted for the Bald <br/>
Cypress box yet).<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have better luck in St. Augustine.  If you get over toward <br/>
Orlando or Tampa, there are quite a few boxes. (I planted 2 in the <br/>
St. Petersburg area) and I know that Mountain Scorpia hid a whole <br/>
bunch near Deland, Florida just a month or two ago!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Megan, I think you won't have trouble finding the St. Augustine box if it's <br/>
still there.  Cleverly hidden, but not difficult to find.  A box called <br/>
Flapjack went missing at DeLeon Springs (near DeLand) almost as soon as it <br/>
was placed, and those who planted it never responded to my posts, so I fixed <br/>
up a "Son of Flapjack" box and took it deeper into the trail.  You might <br/>
like to do likewise with the Bald Cypress... If you go to Hontoon, be sure <br/>
to spray your clothing as well as your exposed skin - the skeeters are <br/>
relentless when you stop to stamp up!<br/>
