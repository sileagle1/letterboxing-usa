Wendy has not remained in letterboxing which is unfortunate. Her clues <br/>

A fellow butterfly enthusiast and I decided to try combining our butterfly walks with letterboxing (we call it Leps &amp; Letterboxing).  We had a lovely, if somewhat steep, hike, found the butterflies we were seeking (the Falcate Orangetip), and were delighted to find that our first letterbox contained a butterfly stamp!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We did our first LBing in June 2007 while on vacation.  The first box <br/>
we found (which was the second box we looked for) was  the Barview <br/>
Jetty Letterbox in Twin Rocks, OR.  I just looked it up and it is an <br/>
orphan and needs a new logbook.....so if anyone is going to the Oregon <br/>
Coast, maybe you'll want to give this box a new logbook---a small one, <br/>
if I remember correctly.<br/>
<br/>
As for where I was when Kennedy was shot----I was in my typing (yes, <br/>
typing, not keyboarding :o)class in the 9th grade.  They announced it <br/>
over the loudspeakers and the class was so silent you could hear a pin <br/>
drop.  Everyone was so upset we never did get back to work.  <br/>

stuff in it!!<br/>
