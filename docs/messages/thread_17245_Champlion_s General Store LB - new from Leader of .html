In the Eagleville section of Mansfield on Rte 275 heading toward the "dam".<br/>
Find Champlions on your right, but remember Mon. - Sat. 9-5 and Sunday 11-4<br/>
. If you come any other time you are out of luck the door will be locked and<br/>
and the boxed is inside tucked. <br/>
With my apologies to Mr. Moore, <br/>
Twas the night before Christmas and all through the store.<br/>
Not a customer was stirring , none jingled the door.<br/>
When out on the porch there arose such a clatter..<br/>
Letterboxers had arrived I could hear their feet patter!<br/>
They came in through the door with their bags, packs clues and inks.. <br/>
I knew they would find it and gave them a wink.<br/>
As they took in the scene like 100 years ago. <br/>
they turned toward the Regulator and walked that way slow.<br/>
Their eyes how they twinkled , anticipation was hot..<br/>
The excitement encircled the whole boxing lot.  <br/>
They got straight to their work solving clue after clue <br/>
and stood here  by  the minute figuring next what to do.<br/>
The odor was that of fresh ground peanut butter <br/>
And the clue said to look careful not attracting another.<br/>
When what to their wondering eyes did appear? <br/>
A miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.<br/>
It was there on the shelf -Just south of the butter <br/>
and they had it in a moment, relief they did utter. <br/>
I heard them exclaim ere they drove out of sight, <br/>
"that was a great box, it will keep us for tonight!"<br/>
