<br/>
JugglerMouse and I started in April the Camelot Series that Ryan <br/>
Carpenter placed out by El Chorro Park. We were flummoxed by the <br/>
clues for the Goblet of Eternal Life and finally gave up. On July 3rd <br/>
we went back (along with Ash Raven), walked up to Eagle Rock the <br/>
wrong way but found the Castle box. The view was nothing short of <br/>
breathtaking. We were second only to Gwen (of Don and Gwen). We <br/>
traced the clues backwards and found the Shield of Mortimer and then <br/>
the Goblet of Eternal Life really made sense. As Gwenn put it with <br/>
her stamp on the book, "Oh, THAT first checkpoint!"<br/>
<br/>
There was an enormous sense of accomplishment in finding the rest of <br/>
the stamps. Sometimes having things a little tough adds enourmously <br/>
to their value. I can see why Ryan is proud of these stamps: they are <br/>
tiny and very well carved. Really worth your time (notice you have <br/>
not been there yet, Amanda) and the very gentle climb.<br/>
<br/>
This is not to say we have not all, at one time or another, cursed <br/>
under and over our breaths at Ryan for what we preceived as "flaky <br/>
clues." We all get frustrated. What seems obvious to the planter may <br/>
not be to the would be finder.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those who plant, thanks to those who find,<br/>
Sir Balthazar<br/>
