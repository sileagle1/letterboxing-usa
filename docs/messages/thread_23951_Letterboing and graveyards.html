Hi Baker<br/>
<br/>
Rather than posting my reply on your blog I would rather post it here.<br/>
Gwen and I just finished a letterboxing road trip to Morro Bay, Ca. <br/>
and one of the letterboxes was located at a graveyard. We chose <br/>
Saturday 11/11 to search for the box. Not only did we find the <br/>
letterbox but was moved by the ceremony for Veterans Day. All of the <br/>
Veterans' sites were marked with small American Flags and the VFW had <br/>
a program honoring the Vets. The program ended with a 21 gun salute <br/>
and taps. Letterboxing in a graveyard? You bet!!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We find ourselves drawn to graveyards when thinking of planting a box.  <br/>
Some of the older cemeteries have the best hand carve stones and some <br/>
great history.  We try to be very respectful of the area and those who <br/>
are there.  <br/>
<br/>
When writing clues for the cemeteries, we usally do some research on <br/>
some of the residence and use them in the clues.<br/>
<br/>
We planted a box on 11/11/06, "Veterans Day Dedication" as a reminder <br/>
of Veterans every day.  If anyone visits it, we hoped you enjoy it.<br/>

for a box.  It reminds me of all the people who came before me that I must thank <br/>
for their part in this country of ours. The regular  people you don't get to <br/>
read about in your history books.  It is a great way to learn about the <br/>
community in which you live or are visiting.  <br/>
I always say a prayer for them and their families when I visit the cemetry. <br/>
So yes, I support boxes in graveyards. <br/>
