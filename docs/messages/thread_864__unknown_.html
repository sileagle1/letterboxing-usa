I tried to send this to you directly, but it kept getting bounced back, so here goes...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for putting this together.  I am having trouble with the map though, as well as trying to print this out.  Any chance you could e-mail me the map and legend?  That would be really helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.  Looking forward to meeting you, your family, and other letterboxers.<br/>

It's starting to sound like we'll have a great turnout for our <br/>
weekend get together, May 12-14 at Rocky Neck State Park in East Lyme <br/>
CT. We're really looking forward to meeting everyone and enjoying the <br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the address for a "planner" we put together to help you decide <br/>
on which letterboxes to visit:<br/>
<br/>
http://freepages.outdoors.rootsweb.com/~drewclan/gathering.htm <br/>
<br/>
Sorry it's not the most reliable web page we've ever put up...but <br/>
it's a way to start thinking ahead about all the choices you'll have. <br/>
We plan on bringing a stack of Drew family cluesheets, and are hoping <br/>
that Sarah and Bob will do the same with the other local boxes, so <br/>
you won't have to print out a bunch from your computer if you don't <br/>
want to. And, following past tradition, we're carving a gathering <br/>
stamp that'll be hidden just for the weekend get together. See you <br/>
soon!<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] (unknown)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; On NPR's Morning Edition last week, Nina Tottenberg<br/>
&gt; said that if the<br/>
&gt;  Supreme Court supports Congress, it is in effect the<br/>
&gt; end of the<br/>
&gt; National<br/>
&gt;  Public Radio (NPR), NEA &amp; the Public Broadcasting<br/>
&gt; System PBS).  PBS,<br/>
&gt; NPR<br/>
&gt;  and the arts are facing major cutbacks in funding. In<br/>
&gt; spite of the<br/>
&gt; efforts<br/>
&gt;  of each station to reduce spending costs and<br/>
&gt; streamline their<br/>
&gt; services,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  some government officials believe that the funding<br/>
&gt; currently going to<br/>
&gt; these<br/>
&gt;  programs is too large a portion of funding for<br/>
&gt; something which is seen<br/>
&gt;  as not worthwhile. Currently, taxes from the general<br/>
&gt; public for PBS<br/>
&gt; equal<br/>
&gt;  $1.12 per person per year, and the National Endowment<br/>
&gt; for the Arts<br/>
&gt; equals $.<br/>
&gt; 64 a year.  A January 1995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll<br/>
&gt; indicated that 76%<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt;  Americans wish to keep funding for PBS, third only to<br/>
&gt; national defense<br/>
&gt;  and law enforcement as the most valuable programs for<br/>
&gt; federal funding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  The Senate and House appropriations committees each<br/>
&gt; have 13<br/>
&gt; subcommittees<br/>
&gt;  with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies.<br/>
&gt; Each subcommittee<br/>
&gt;  passes its own appropriation bill. The goal each year<br/>
&gt; is to have each<br/>
&gt;  bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year,<br/>
&gt; which is October 1.<br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt;  only way that our representatives can be aware of the<br/>
&gt; base of support<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt;  PBS and funding for these types of programs is by<br/>
&gt; making our voices<br/>
&gt; heard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Please add your name to this list and forward it to<br/>
&gt; friends who<br/>
&gt; believe<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt;  what this stands for.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  This list will be forwarded to the President of the<br/>
&gt; United States and<br/>
&gt;  the Vice President of the United States. This<br/>
&gt; petition is being passed<br/>
&gt;  around the Internet.  Please add your name to it so<br/>
&gt; that funding can<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  maintained for the NEA, NPR &amp; PBS.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  HOW TO SIGN &amp; FORWARD: IT'S EASY: Please keep this<br/>
&gt; petition rolling.<br/>
&gt; Do<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  not reply to me. Please sign and forward to others to<br/>
&gt; sign. If you<br/>
&gt;  prefer not to sign, please send to the e-mail address<br/>
&gt; indicated below.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  DON'T WORRY ABOUT DUPLICATES. This is being forwarded<br/>
&gt; to several<br/>
&gt;  people at once to add their names to the petition. It<br/>
&gt; won't matter if<br/>
&gt;  many people receive the same list as the names are<br/>
&gt; being managed. This<br/>
&gt; is for<br/>
&gt;  anyone who thinks NPR/PBS is a worthwhile expenditure<br/>
&gt; of $1.12/year of<br/>
&gt;  their taxes, a petition follows.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  If you sign, please forward on to others. If not,<br/>
&gt; please don't<br/>
&gt;  kill it-send it to the email address listed here:<br/>
&gt;              wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  NOTE: If you happen to be the 150th, 200th, 250th,<br/>
&gt; etc., signer of<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  petition, please forward a copy to:<br/>
&gt;         wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  This way we can keep track of the lists and organize<br/>
&gt; them. Forward<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;  everyone you know, and help us to keep these programs<br/>
&gt; alive. Thank<br/>
&gt; you!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  NOTE: It is preferable that you SELECT (highlight)<br/>
&gt; the entirety<br/>
&gt;  of this letter and then COPY it into a new outgoing<br/>
&gt; message, rather<br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt;  simply forwarding it. In your new outgoing message,<br/>
&gt; add your name to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;  bottom of the list, then send it on. Or if option is<br/>
&gt; available, do a<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please note, the road directions on the White Rock at<br/>
&gt;Black Rock (Block Island box) were incorrect.  Here is<br/>
&gt;the corrected directions, sorry for any inconviences.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;White Rock at Black Rock<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Block Island, Rhode Island<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Directions from Old Harbor and the Pt. Judith/New<br/>
&gt;London Ferries:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;           Take a left out of the parking lot and up<br/>
&gt;to the Rebecca statue, at the fork in the road go<br/>
&gt;straight onto Spring Street.  You will pass the<br/>
&gt;Southeast Lighthouse and the road will become the<br/>
&gt;Mohegan Trail.  Stay on this road and follow until you<br/>
&gt;see a painted  rock. The road will make a sharp right,<br/>
&gt;at that point it becomes Lakeside Drive.  After a big<br/>
&gt;pond,Fresh Pond, there will be a left(Cooneymous<br/>
&gt;Road). Take it and follow for about 1/4-1/2 mile. On<br/>
&gt;your left will be Rodman's    Hollow, enter at the<br/>
&gt;second Rodman's Hollow sign.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;           Enter the trailhead and continue on past<br/>
&gt;the info board. Go past Old Mill Road and enter the   <br/>
&gt;  turnstyle on your left. Follow the sign for the<br/>
&gt;"Short Loop". Go through the stone wall and then take<br/>
&gt;your immediate right. Go through that stone wall and<br/>
&gt;take a left. You will follow the length of that stone<br/>
&gt;wall, even when you don't see it. You will now be on a<br/>
&gt;dirt road/trail. Follow the 'ez' markings painted on<br/>
&gt;rocks along the trail. Go straight, past several side<br/>
&gt;trails and a 4-way intersection. Continue on until you<br/>
&gt;see the water. From the rock at the end of the trail<br/>
&gt;line up the flag pole at 100 degrees. Follow the trail<br/>
&gt;that heads towards the house for 20 feet. Turn around<br/>
&gt;and look under the white rock in the wall.<br/>

<br/>
  Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
  I wanted to be the first to publicly thank<br/>
  letterboxingbee for putting together the NJ gathering today. We had a<br/>
  great time and can't wait to head back to Jersey for more boxes. We<br/>
  got 6 event only boxes, found a HH, got I forget how many other event<br/>
  boxes, and a ton of exchanges. I think all together we got 29 new<br/>
  stamps (although I only got 27 in my book since I somehow managed to<br/>
  miss getting DnA's stamps.) **smacks self in head**<br/>
<br/>
  Letterboxingbee did a great job organizing everything (and everyone)<br/>
  and planting the event only boxes. She should be very proud of <br/>
  herself. I know I am.  :)<br/>
<br/>
  If we're still here next year, we hope to do it all again! <br/>
<br/>
  Thanks again,<br/>
  NeverEnuff and Team PresSinOn <br/>

Well, where I grew up in NH, it was a frappe, but here in CT it is a<br/>
milkshake.  I don't believe I have ever had a drink from a bubbler<br/>
but have used a water fountain many times.  I've had funnel cake in<br/>
PA and fried dough in MA and CT.  They don't look alike although they<br/>
may be about the same composition.  I thought a doughboy was a<br/>
soldier. ;-)<br/>

&gt; Well, where I grew up in NH, it was a frappe, but here in CT it is a<br/>
&gt; milkshake.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in NJ and PA on milkshakes. Mom grew up in MA on frappes. <br/>
When I moved to RI, I discovered the 'Awful Awful'<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I also started life thinking the long sandwiches were called <br/>
grinders. They weren't subs or hoagies or heros or I'talians (with a <br/>
strong *I*..... up in Maine) until years later.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmm, new food series? COuld be fun. :-)<br/>

Hmmm.....milkshakes, water fountain and fried dough! :)<br/>
<br/>
I've never had funnel cake or a doughboy! And I've never ever heard a<br/>
milkshake called a cabinet! Too strange!<br/>

&gt; Well, where I grew up in NH, it was a frappe, but here in CT it is a<br/>
&gt; milkshake.  I don't believe I have ever had a drink from a bubbler<br/>
&gt; but have used a water fountain many times.  I've had funnel cake in<br/>
&gt; PA and fried dough in MA and CT.  They don't look alike although <br/>
they<br/>
&gt; may be about the same composition.  I thought a doughboy was a<br/>
&gt; soldier. ;-)<br/>

KINDLY REACH ME IN MY PRIVATE EMAIL <br/>
 (mrmikeade@netscape.net) <br/>
FOR MORE DETAILS OF THE TRANSACTIONS.<br/>
 BARR.MIKE ADE.Tel:234-8034432750<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dear Beloved in Christ,<br/>
<br/>
It is by the grace of God that I received<br/>
Christ,knowing the truth and <br/>
the truth have set me free.Having known the truth, I<br/>
had no choice than <br/>
to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for<br/>
eternal life and <br/>
in the sight of man for witness of Gods mercy and<br/>
glory upon my life.<br/>
I have the pleasure to share my testimony with<br/>
you,having seen your <br/>
contact from the Internet. I am BARRISTER MIKE ADE,the<br/>
legal adviser to <br/>
late Mr. and Mrs. Bright Williams,a British couple<br/>
that lived in my <br/>
Country Nigeria for 25 years before they both died in<br/>
a plane crash <br/>
late last year. These couple were good Christians,<br/>
they were so <br/>
dedicated to God but they had no child till they died.<br/>
Throughout their <br/>
stay in my country, they acquired a lot of properties<br/>
like lands, house <br/>
properties, etc.<br/>
<br/>
As their legal adviser, before their death, the<br/>
husband Mr. Bright <br/>
Williams instructed me to write his WILL. Because they<br/>
had no child, <br/>
they dedicated their wealth to God. According to the<br/>
WILL, the <br/>
properties have to be sold and the money be given out<br/>
to a ministry for <br/>
the work of God. As their legal adviser, all the<br/>
documents for the <br/>
properties were in my care.<br/>
<br/>
He gave me the authority to sell the properties and<br/>
give out the fund <br/>
to the Ministries for the work of God.<br/>
<br/>
To cut the story short, I sold all the properties<br/>
after their death, as <br/>
instructed by my client,Mr. Bright Williams before his<br/>
death.<br/>
And as matter of fact, after I sold all their<br/>
properties,expectedly, I <br/>
realized a huge amount of money that runs into<br/>
millions of dollars,and <br/>
what supposed to be the percentage interest of my<br/>
right legal fee was <br/>
firstly deducted by me out of the total amount<br/>
realized from the sold <br/>
properties, this was based on the initial agreement<br/>
between me and the<br/>
owner of the properties before his death. <br/>
<br/>
Therefore,the total amount left to be invested into<br/>
God's work as <br/>
instructed by the owner is $20,000,000.00 (twenty<br/>
million US dollars) <br/>
only. But Instead of giving the main fund out for the<br/>
work of God as <br/>
instructed to me by my client before his death.<br/>
<br/>
I converted the fund to myself with the intention of<br/>
investing the fund <br/>
abroad for my personal use. I was afraid of putting<br/>
the fund in the <br/>
Bank, because I have to give account to the bank on<br/>
how got the money. <br/>
I then packaged the fund in consignments and deposited<br/>
the consignments <br/>
with a security company. I did not want the management<br/>
of the Security <br/>
Company to know the content of the consignments,<br/>
therefore I registered <br/>
the content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the<br/>
security company <br/>
believes that what I deposited with them was Gold<br/>
Bars. <br/>
<br/>
I had encounter with Christ when Pastor Benny Hinn was<br/>
preaching on <br/>
television concerning Ananias and Saphira in Acts<br/>
5:1-11. After hearing <br/>
the word of God, I gave my life to Christ and became a<br/>
born again <br/>
Christian.<br/>
<br/>
As a born again Christian, I started reading my bible<br/>
and one day, the <br/>
Lord opened my eyes to Ezekiel 33: 18 and 19. From the<br/>
scripture, I <br/>
discovered that the only way I could have peace in my<br/>
life is to do <br/>
what is lawful and right by giving out the fund as<br/>
instructed for the <br/>
work of God by my client.<br/>
<br/>
I have asked God for forgiveness on my initial thought<br/>
concerning the <br/>
money,and I know that God have forgiven me. But I have<br/>
to do what is <br/>
lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the<br/>
fund to the <br/>
chosen ministry for the purpose of God's work as<br/>
instructed by my <br/>
client before his death.<br/>
<br/>
After my fasting and prayers, I asked God to make his<br/>
choice and direct <br/>
me to a honest Christian or the chosen ministry that<br/>
deserves this fund <br/>
by his Grace.<br/>
<br/>
I then came across your address on the Internet as I<br/>
was browsing <br/>
through a Christian site, and as a matter of fact, it<br/>
is not only you <br/>
or your ministry that I picked on the Christian site<br/>
initially, but <br/>
after my fervent prayer over it, then you were<br/>
nominated through divine <br/>
revelation from God, so that was  how I received such<br/>
a divine <br/>
revelation from the Lord, how I got your contact<br/>
information, and I <br/>
then decided to contact you for the fund to be used<br/>
wisely for things <br/>
that will glorify the name of God.<br/>
<br/>
I have notified the Security Company where I deposited<br/>
the consignments <br/>
that contained the fund, that I am moving the<br/>
consignment abroad and <br/>
the security company has since been waiting for my<br/>
authority for the <br/>
consignment to leave my country and be moved abroad.<br/>
So if you know <br/>
that you will use this fund honestly and wisely for<br/>
things that will <br/>
glorify God's name,then do contact me back,ASAP.Then<br/>
you send to me in <br/>
your reply,YOUR FULL NAMES,YOUR PERSONAL ADDRESS,YOUR<br/>
TELEPHONE AND FAX <br/>
NUMBERS.These informations are required by the seurity<br/>
company to<br/>

hitchhikers aren't "finds."  To me, a "find" would have to have a set of<br/>
clues, a logbook, and a stamp.  Thus three boxes in a series of clues where<br/>
all three boxes had a stamp and logbook would be three finds to me.  But if<br/>
there were three boxes in a series but only the last box had a logbook, then<br/>
it would only be one find to me.  Hitchhikers have no clues of their own, so<br/>
to me, they're no more a "find" than a personal traveller would be, or than<br/>
doing an exchange out on the trail if two boxers happen to meet each other,<br/>
etc.  These things to me wouldn't be "finds."<br/>
<br/>
But there are no real rules on it -- it's definitely a ymmv thing.  For<br/>
every 100 boxers out there, there are probably 102 different ways to<br/>
"count."<br/>

rule that they HAVE to be counted in your F count.  As with so many other<br/>
letterboxing things, it's up to you.  I suggest you think through what each<br/>
element of your counts means to you, and then consisitently count according<br/>
to those guidelines.<br/>
<br/>
As an example, for me, F count means I followed the clues to find the box.<br/>
It's boxes I put out an effort to find, applied skill to.  I don't count<br/>
postal boxes in my F count because I didn't put anything into finding them,<br/>
other than adding my address to a list, which most days doesn't really<br/>
require skill.  I count HH's separately as well for the same reason.  This<br/>
isn't to say I don't enjoy getting a postal every now and then, or that I<br/>
think HH's are less meaningful than regular boxes, and I do love to look at<br/>
the stamps from the games we've played at gatherings, but none of these adds<br/>
to my F Count because - to me - F stands for EFfort.<br/>
<br/>
Count isn't everything - your logbook is.  It should give you pleasure to go<br/>
back through it, and hopefully it brings back memories of places you've gone<br/>
that you wouldn't have visited before, or people you've met along the way,<br/>
or adventures you've experienced.  In the end, you still have the same<br/>
number of stamps in your logbook, no matter how you count them.  So enjoy<br/>
them, every one of them.<br/>

over the "F-count" conceptually, i.e.: just what constitutes a <br/>

Somewhere between F-170 and F-178; your milage may vary... <br/>

&gt; to add a few things to the previous post:<br/>
&gt; i live in new london county, connecticut. there is a 2 box set <br/>
&gt; called letter from a traitor.  on LBNA its listed as 1 box even <br/>
&gt; though you have to go to 2 different locations and get 2 different <br/>
&gt; boxes.  also there is one named the ledyard oak.  there is a <br/>
ledyard <br/>
&gt; oak stamp and on the page with the ledyard oak clues are clues to 2 <br/>
&gt; more boxes on the same trail however the list has it listed as 1 <br/>
box <br/>
&gt; (3 total in that location).  our book is like 10 higher than our <br/>
&gt; online count because of things like this and bonus boxes.  WOMs <br/>
also <br/>
&gt; increase your count but not your online count.  here is my question <br/>
&gt; to everybody.  we have found 98 different letterboxes.  we have <br/>
&gt; found 4 hitchhikers on our travels.  on our PFX count, is our F 98 <br/>
&gt; or 102?  i was told only 1 stamp per box counts however somebody <br/>
&gt; else told me hitchhikers count towards your finds as well.  still <br/>
&gt; trying to figure this out.  thanks, chris<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Folks sometimes place clues in a box that leads to another <br/>
&gt; nearby. The 'bonus' box will not be listed so you may find 5 boxes <br/>
&gt; but only get online credit for 4..IE. My log book is currently 2 <br/>
&gt; boxes over my credits due two bonus stamps.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;  Also many more folks find boxes from the sites but do not record <br/>
&gt; them on the internet. IE..You may see 5 listed finders on the web <br/>
&gt; but there could be 10 folks who stamped in.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;  Many other examples may also apply.<br/>

&gt; &gt;      * We understand that you may have found or placed MANY more <br/>
&gt; boxes than you've registered on LbNA. :D <br/>
&gt; &gt;  That is the message that I received after posting the clues for <br/>
&gt; my first letterbox. Did I miss something when I signed up? How do <br/>
&gt; I "register" the boxes?<br/>
