day for a great "between the rains - window of opportunity" hike and <br/>
super evening of letterboxing camaraderie!  Sue and Joie have simply <br/>
some of the best smiles around, and it was such a pleasure being in <br/>
their company! Between bites of barbeque, we even got to doodle on the <br/>
tablecloth with the crayons provided and to discover that we just <br/>
happened to be sitting at the table next to another customer's drawing <br/>
of "Dancing Men"! (hints to which are always available upon request!) <br/>
 We also managed to find one more Mapsurfer box the next day, and a <br/>
few more NJ boxes on the way home, plus See Joy gave us a beautiful <br/>
new phoenix hitcher("From ashes we rise")to start on its journeys,too! <br/>
What a great weekend!<br/>
Thanks again,guys!<br/>
