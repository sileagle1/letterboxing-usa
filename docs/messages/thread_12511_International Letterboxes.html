I did a work around by doing a Search All Boxes and scrolled through<br/>
the list. I did not see any for Sweden, with the closest being in<br/>
Germany. I tried Google to no avail. Sorry I couldn't help more.<br/>

Thanks we will check out the sites listed. At first glance it looks <br/>
like we will have the first planted letterboxes in Sweden.<br/>

We recently posted 3 letterboxes in Sweden and used "Sweden" in the titles. This allows them to be pulled up by going to LBNA Search for boxes and typing in "Sweden" in the Word/phrase in box name. Google has them listed also, but that link goes to What's New, but hopefully that may change. If you are planning on planting a letterbox out of the country you might want to use the country's name in the title.<br/>
