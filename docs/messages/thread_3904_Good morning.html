There is a list for CT 'Boxers. It's pretty new so low volume so far.<br/>

Thank you! We drove by last weekend to a swim meet in Meriden, but <br/>
were unable to stop in. We always mean to get back up to that awesome <br/>
place and do a box in "the camel's hump" further along the trail. <br/>
Can't wait to see your clues!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am learning, still new at this. I notice that others have found wet<br/>
letterboxes. The Grinning Ninny was so wet that many of the pages just<br/>
fell out. I dried it but it is very mouldy  I  can go back and remove<br/>
the book and replace it with a new one, if the owner would speak up,<br/>
then I would mail the book off to them Also there is no stamp pad in the<br/>
box and Iwould be happy to place one there, what color would you<br/>
want.The stamp is a great one and looks as if the pad might have been<br/>
green at one time. I used mine -red - sorry. . How could I find out who<br/>
the ower is.? Also the box at Seldon Creek [the point one] is megga wet<br/>
and the box is cracked.. We did replace a silver stamp pad for<br/>
Resolution as it was cracked and dried out and an easy one for me to<br/>
return to the next day. It would seem that one must carry lots of exta<br/>
things to save the day.!! Still fun<br/>

Selden Point and Resolution are both ours: thank you so much for <br/>
fixing them up! We get to Resolution periodically to check it but <br/>
haven't been back to beautiful Selden as much as we'd like. <br/>
Pete&amp;Wanda had mentioned that both the original and the replacement <br/>
boxes were there and we haven't been able to get back and see for <br/>
ourselves. Weird!<br/>
<br/>
We've had many kind people repair, rescue, and even recarve-and-<br/>
replace letterboxes for us and it is very much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
We also carry blank letterbox fixin's with us and repair/replace on <br/>
the trail when we're seeking other's boxes. You never know when a <br/>
ziplock or a tupperware will help. Too bad blow-driers don't work in <br/>
the woods!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
