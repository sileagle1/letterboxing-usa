Never be embarassed about your stamps.  We all started with simply <br/>
carved stamps, and that only after using a commercial one for a <br/>
while.  There were several people there who said they were new and <br/>
some with commercial stamps for their personal stamp.  One in <br/>
particular of which I thought was really cool.  <br/>

Hope to see you on the trail or otherwise.  There is always the <br/>

Ever since finding our first box last weekend (thank you Team Kelly!) and reading all of the emails we have been stressing about the importance of the stamps. While my son is a gifted artist and drew some phenominal artwork the carving has been a pain and the erasers are just too darn small. We are dying to plant boxes and have some great box ideas based on our other hobbies (caving, bats, hiking, dogs, guitars and the Grateful Dead) but have been stressing about the stamps. This email helps us relax and just enjoy the hobby, and not focus excessively  on stamp carving. We ordered some materials on line and will do our best but we'll probably use lot's of commercial stamps. Hope everyone enjoys them anyway. Can't wait to start planting boxes and posting clues,<br/>

Your post cought my eye and I wanted to encourage you to not be embarraced<br/>
aobut the paucity of your stamps!  Its not about the count, its aobut<br/>
enjoyign the  sport!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have a chance to get to another gather sometime--you will meet<br/>
the nicest people there! (and if you are lucky--you might find a master<br/>
carver to carve your stamp--I did, lol!)<br/>

Don't stress!   This is supposed to be *FUN*!<br/>
<br/>
I used a store-bought stamp in one of my boxes.   I mentioned it in the <br/>
clues.   That way, if it's really an issue for someone, they don't have to hunt <br/>
that box.   (Which would be a shame, because the hike is really nice!<br/>
