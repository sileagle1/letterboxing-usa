it, replaced what we could find, made a temp log book, and put it in <br/>
its home. No stamp. <pout>. We saw a lot of deer, as usual. Also a <br/>
fox,, my prime suspect, lol, he was at the sceene of the crime when <br/>
we arrived. My 3 year old daughter had a great time and got to lay <br/>
her first mark!! She is a trooper. We look forward to going back <br/>
again for the rest of them, and that one if it is restored. To <br/>
anyone that maybe in the area, GREAT time to goto the park, the buck <br/>
have full antlers and youll see quite a few. :) <br/>
<br/>
Ps look out for that fox!!!!<br/>
