get a couple drive by's in the rain.  First stop was Brandi's <br/>
memorial box, not really a drive by, but the rain let up and we <br/>
lucked out.  Then to the blue goose of Lebanon.  We found the first <br/>
box of the Lebanon Loop then got the Capt. Gray box.  Stopped for <br/>
lunch at Uncle D's Italian restaurant for a couple sandwiches.  Very <br/>
good, quiet atmosphere.  Then found the rest of the Lebanon loop <br/>
boxes.  All boxes were found in very good condition.  Next time it's <br/>
raining we're heading for Mansfield!!!  All in all, the area is full <br/>
of history and good boxing! The two person, one holding an umbrella <br/>
over the one doing the stamping method works quite well-- everything <br/>
was dry except our legs from the knees down  Oh Well!! Better than <br/>
staying home any day-- Box On people!!!!!! Sunshine+Swamp Yankee<br/>
