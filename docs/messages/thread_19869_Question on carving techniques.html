Hi All...<br/>
<br/>
I was surfing the net for carving pointers and stumbled onto a site <br/>
that showed a different tool <other carvers="" speedball="" than="" the=""> that I <br/>
thought someone might know about.<br/>
<br/>
After having to run out of the house for awhile, I found that I didn't <br/>
bookmark the page. Now, of course, I can't find it (even with my <br/>
'history' feature!)<br/>
<br/>
The carving tool(s?) looked like it burned or electrically etched in <br/>
the image? Something like that?  Anyway... as I carve my first stamp I <br/>
wonder if there is something different for very fine details other than <br/>
the "#1V shaper liner" tool that I'm using. Any suggestions would be <br/>
appreciated :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Sounds like a wood-carving type of thing.  I've noticed stuff like <br/>
that while wandering the aisles at Michaels out of curiosity.  Wood <br/>
workers might now more about it, but they won't be very useful for <br/>
carving stamps as we do it.  =)<br/>

<br/>
Some people have been known to use hypodermic (sp?!) needles to <br/>
carve, though I'll be darned how they can do it.  I just can't seem <br/>
to master that technique!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a great idea!  The tip of a needle is shaped ike a gouge( that's a pleasant thought is'nt it). I think a very large gauge would work very well.  I'm taking big not what you would use to inject anything into a person. In hospitals we use a real large gauge to draw up contrast media in 50cc syringes. I think I'll give it a try.  <br/>
