Placed: 3-8-03<br/>

Location: Putnam Ct.Windham County<br/>
Rated: Moderate<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Go 171 west in Putnam.  Turn left onto Wicker St at the <br/>
stop lights.  Park at the Putnam Track Field parking area.  Walk past <br/>
the Putnam National Guard Armory and go right so the Armory will be <br/>
on your right and the baseball fence on your left.  At the end of the <br/>
fence go left.  You'll see a sign on the right that says "Putnam <br/>
Fitness Trail"  go unto the path.  As soon as you cross a bridge, <br/>
look for a 3 sister tree on your left.  The Dragonfly Letterbox is <br/>
behind the tree under some sticks.  Take the trail heading N.  Soon <br/>
you'll come to a Y go left.  You'll notice alot of pine trees around <br/>
this area.  When the trail comes to another Y about 15-20 yards up<br/>
(There will be a small tree with an inappropriate word on it-small <br/>
warning for those with children) Go left to a tree that woodpeckers <br/>
like to use.  Take a reading of 140 degrees to a stump about 51/2 <br/>
feet tall.  The Bumblebee Letterbox is on top covered with sticks and <br/>
bark.  Head back to the main path and continue walking.  As you walk <br/>
along the path you'll notice the river gets closer.  You'll soon pass <br/>
the Putnam Football Practice Field with the Putnam Middle School in <br/>
view up the hill on your right.  You will cross another tiny bridge.  <br/>
When you see the stairs heading up, stop.  Take the small path on <br/>
your left.  A short ways down the path, look for a dead tree lying in <br/>
3 sisters with 2 red arrows on the tree.  The Butterfly Letterbox is <br/>
in the middle of the 3 sisters.  Back to the path and up the stairs.  <br/>
(This part of the hike is the Putnam Middle Schools.  Please be very <br/>
respectful, thank you) You have to get over to the pine trees behind <br/>
the metal backstop at 40 degrees.  The path continues there.  Look <br/>
for 2 orange and 1 yellow ribbon hanging from trees, that were the <br/>
path is.  Soon, you'll head up a hill into a forest of pines.  Just <br/>
past 4 big rockson your left is a fallen pine tree.  The far right <br/>
side of the base is The Ladybub Letterbox.  <br/>
We put 2 stamps in each box because we used to run this trail for <br/>
cross country in pairs for practice.  This is where I met Teach for <br/>
the first time.  Hope you enjoyed your hike.<br/>
