                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings to all you letterboxers in Maryland from Martini Man, a <br/>
Wisconsin letterboxer! My spouse, Wisconsin Hiker, and I took up <br/>
letterboxing last summer on the advice of a friend. We have been avid <br/>
hunters and we also have started to place some in our area. Wisconsin <br/>
Hiker was recently scheduled to go out of town to the Baltimore area <br/>
on business for a couple of weeks. She had a great idea and asked if <br/>
I could come out over the weekend for some letterboxing in Maryland. <br/>
Well I agreed and it was a great experience. From Saturday, April17, <br/>
till Sunday, April 18, we boxed until we dropped. Here's the<br/>
blow-by-<br/>
blow of how we did. We thought this would be of interest to our <br/>
Maryland colleagues in regard to the status of their boxes. For the <br/>
ones we could not find.well, it might be us, but we looked HARD.<br/>
<br/>
