fine and right where it was supposed to be on the afternoon of April <br/>
19th.  It had the "Longhorn hitchhiker" sharing it's box which we <br/>
removed to put somewhere else.  There were a couple of yours in <br/>
Yocktangee Park we couldn't find but it was very crowded and we <br/>
didn't want to be too obvious.  We'll try for them again another day.<br/>
