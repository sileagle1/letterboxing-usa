                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't think it matters.  Remember, the smaller it is, the easier <br/>
it is to hide at various locations (especially if you have to co-<br/>
locate two large containers).  Some folks think that if the HH is <br/>
only in a ziploc bag that the stamp might be more likely to become <br/>
separated from it's log book.  I've found both types in my <br/>
experiences and don't really prefer one over the other.  Both <br/>
methods seem to work quite nicely.  If you go the ziploc bag <br/>
approach, make sure that EVERY COMPONENT is well marked that it is <br/>
part of a hitchhiker set!!!  You might want to include an info sheet <br/>
specifically written for hitchhikers as some folks may not know what <br/>
they have when they find it!<br/>
