Due to the growing pains you are having, it seems that the best thing to<br/>
do is to move towards a web-based discussion forum. That way you could<br/>
spread topics around to specific categories, but keep the cohesion of<br/>
discussions in one location on the web.<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong. An email discussion group is great but once it<br/>
achieves a certain number of users, the system tends to break down.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just offering a suggestion from experience that you can feel free to<br/>
digest or discard. I haven't looked recently, but there are various<br/>
companies that supply free forums applications you can use without much<br/>
difficulty. <br/>
