I see the new letterboxes being placed into the LbNA's "What's New" page, but I'm<br/>
curious if they are being rotated into the map that is searchable by state?<br/>
<br/>
It would seem newcomers would start off by clicking on their home states before<br/>
searching a text list of archived "What's New" pages.<br/>
<br/>
I know this sort of thing is hard work, and it's surely appreciated by the users.<br/>

At this time, there are four of us who have responsibility for posting new<br/>
boxes to the state maps. I think that is happening relatively quickly. Jay<br/>
Drew maintains the What's New page, and is also very quick there; he had<br/>
some computer problems for a few weeks, but I think those are now resolved.<br/>
<br/>
If you think that there has been a new box posted to this list that has not<br/>
been put up on either the What's New page or the appropriate state map after<br/>
a few weeks have gone by, please just post a reminder to us all.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the response.  I added two for the Omaha, Nebraska area back in <br/>
late September and early October.<br/>
<br/>
One appears on one What's New page and they both appear on this one: <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/lbna/010931.htm<br/>
<br/>
So far there is only one on the map for Nebraska, and it looks so lonely. <br/>
:)  I was hoping to give it some company and try to get letterboxing going <br/>
in my state.<br/>
<br/>
Regards...<br/>
