                    <div class="plaintext-content">You really should just run a virus scan. If anyone got an email that  <br/>
looked like it came from you, it might have actually come from  <br/>
somewhere else. Also, you may have sent one that looks like it came  <br/>
from someone else in your address books. Some viruses grab an address  <br/>
out of your address book and spoof that as the From address, so  <br/>
that's not a reliable indicator of who does and does not have it......<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't opened it, chances are you're good, but you never know  <br/>
what else has gotten in, so regular scans are pretty much a necessity.<br/>
<br/>
And wow, this thing spread fast. I'm getting it in every group except  <br/>
the fully moderated ones and it's spoofing some weird addresses......<br/>
