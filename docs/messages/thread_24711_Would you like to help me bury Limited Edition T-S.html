                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, everyone. I've been involved in Letterboxing for a long time and <br/>
I just love it and I've been trying to think of ways to get more and <br/>
more people involved. So I printed 100 Limited Edition T-Shirts with <br/>
a cool design on them. I've gotten a bunch of people helping me, but <br/>
I would like to bury at least 1 shirt in every state. (I also have a <br/>
few being buried in other countries)<br/>
<br/>
My plan is for people to find them, take a photo holding the T-Shirt <br/>
up, put their signature stamp on the back of the T-Shirt, and then <br/>
replace the T-Shirt for others to find. Everyone can then e-mail me <br/>
the photos that they took of the shirt and at the end of the year <br/>
I'll give away some cool prizes or something. <br/>
<br/>
Thoughts? Want to help?<br/>
<br/>
I'll e-mail you a T-Shirt. Your job would be to come up with some <br/>
awesome clues and maybe some ciphers and riddles, etc. to make it a <br/>
bit more interesting.<br/>
<br/>
To keep anyone from walking away with a T-Shirt, I had the shirts <br/>
printed extra small. Believe me, no one will be able to fit into one <br/>
of these little fellahs. Besides, why would anyone want to take one <br/>
anyway, and ruin the adventure for others? Also if they just find it <br/>
and replace it, there's a chance of winning a prize.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah, and for helping me do this I can offer you a free T-shirt, <br/>
too, or something. As if the fun of doing it wans't enough! <br/>
<br/>
So ... what do you think?<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to e-mail me directly and let me know what state you are in <br/>
and what ideas you have for clues, etc. and we'll try to work <br/>
something out.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'm koo-koo, but my heart's in the right place, so that counts <br/>
for something; right?<br/>

That's a really cool idea. Especially the part where you ship a t-shirt via e-mail. :-0<br/>

I'm in Michigan and I would love to do this. I am planning an event that deals with fairies, sprites, and nymphs and one if the things I am doing is making a tiny opening  to go with clues to the hidden fairy world. This little shirt would be perfect. I would love to represent Michigan. Email me directly for more as I don;t want to give away to much on the boards.<br/>

Letterboxing simply by talking about this idea, so once again ... if <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Hey, everyone. I've been involved in Letterboxing for a long time and <br/>
I just love it and I've been trying to think of ways to get more and <br/>
more people involved. So I printed 100 Limited Edition T-Shirts with <br/>
a cool design on them. I've gotten a bunch of people helping me, but <br/>
I would like to bury at least 1 shirt in every state. (I also have a <br/>
few being buried in other countries)<br/>
<br/>
My plan is for people to find them, take a photo holding the T-Shirt <br/>
up, put their signature stamp on the back of the T-Shirt, and then <br/>
replace the T-Shirt for others to find. Everyone can then e-mail me <br/>
the photos that they took of the shirt and at the end of the year <br/>
I'll give away some cool prizes or something. <br/>
<br/>
Thoughts? Want to help?<br/>
<br/>
I'll e-mail you a T-Shirt. Your job would be to come up with some <br/>
awesome clues and maybe some ciphers and riddles, etc. to make it a <br/>
bit more interesting.<br/>
<br/>

Oh, yeah, and for helping me do this I can offer you a free T-shirt, <br/>

So ... what do you think?<br/>

something out.<br/>

shirts. That's all.<br/>
<br/>
Second, a lot of people are already excited about it. Many of whom never<br/>
even heard of Letterboxing until I told them about it when I mentioned my<br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
Thirs, what do you mean, "it ain't T-Shirt boxing." When was the last time<br/>
you saw a "Letter" in a Letterbox. Fact is, everyone is entitled to have fun<br/>
with this. Putting the T-SHirt in there is no different than anything else.<br/>
Thereason for the shirt is to give people something they can hold up to take<br/>
a photo with, and be big enough that people can put their signature stmap<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, can you kindly contribute something constructive or positve?<br/>
Insulting people doens't reflect well on the source.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey, everyone. I've been involved in Letterboxing for a long time <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; I just love it and I've been trying to think of ways to get more <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; more people involved. So I printed 100 Limited Edition T-Shirts <br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt; a cool design on them. I've gotten a bunch of people helping me, <br/>
but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would like to bury at least 1 shirt in every state. (I also <br/>
have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few being buried in other countries)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My plan is for people to find them, take a photo holding the T-<br/>
Shirt<br/>
&gt; &gt; up, put their signature stamp on the back of the T-Shirt, and then<br/>
&gt; &gt; replace the T-Shirt for others to find. Everyone can then e-mail <br/>
me<br/>
&gt; &gt; the photos that they took of the shirt and at the end of the year<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'll give away some cool prizes or something.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thoughts? Want to help?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'll e-mail you a T-Shirt. Your job would be to come up with some<br/>
&gt; &gt; awesome clues and maybe some ciphers and riddles, etc. to make it <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bit more interesting.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; To keep anyone from walking away with a T-Shirt, I had the shirts<br/>
&gt; &gt; printed extra small. Believe me, no one will be able to fit into <br/>
one<br/>
&gt; &gt; of these little fellahs. Besides, why would anyone want to take <br/>
one<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyway, and ruin the adventure for others? Also if they just find <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; and replace it, there's a chance of winning a prize.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh, yeah, and for helping me do this I can offer you a free T-<br/>
shirt,<br/>
&gt; &gt; too, or something. As if the fun of doing it wans't enough!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So ... what do you think?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Feel free to e-mail me directly and let me know what state you <br/>
are in<br/>
&gt; &gt; and what ideas you have for clues, etc. and we'll try to work<br/>
&gt; &gt; something out.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, the shirts will be removed in 6-12 months and cna be replaced <br/>

Perhaps, we can carve a stamp to go with it and we can make it an "official"<br/>

&gt; Would incorporating some of this little packages of silica gel, or<br/>
&gt; whatever it is, that you find in new shoe boxes and the like? Maybe<br/>
&gt; also in a storage bag with a seal. Probably not totally air tight to<br/>
&gt; allow it to breathe.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Good point. Any ideas on how to keep that from happening? Either <br/>
&gt; &gt; include an air freshner or maybe keep the shirt sealed in a <br/>

&gt; &gt; freezer bag?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, the shirts will be removed in 6-12 months and cna be <br/>
replaced <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;             <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey, everyone. I've been involved in Letterboxing for a long <br/>
time <br/>
&gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I just love it and I've been trying to think of ways to get <br/>
more <br/>
&gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more people involved. So I printed 100 Limited Edition T-Shirts <br/>
&gt; &gt; with <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a cool design on them. I've gotten a bunch of people helping <br/>
me, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to bury at least 1 shirt in every state. (I also <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; &gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; few being buried in other countries)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My plan is for people to find them, take a photo holding the T-<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shirt <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; up, put their signature stamp on the back of the T-Shirt, and <br/>
then <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; replace the T-Shirt for others to find. Everyone can then e-<br/>
mail me <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the photos that they took of the shirt and at the end of the <br/>
year <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll give away some cool prizes or something. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thoughts? Want to help?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll e-mail you a T-Shirt. Your job would be to come up with <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; awesome clues and maybe some ciphers and riddles, etc. to make <br/>
it a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bit more interesting.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; To keep anyone from walking away with a T-Shirt, I had the <br/>
shirts <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; printed extra small. Believe me, no one will be able to fit <br/>
into <br/>
&gt; &gt; one <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of these little fellahs. Besides, why would anyone want to take <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyway, and ruin the adventure for others? Also if they just <br/>
find <br/>
&gt; &gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and replace it, there's a chance of winning a prize.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, yeah, and for helping me do this I can offer you a free T-<br/>
&gt; &gt; shirt, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; too, or something. As if the fun of doing it wans't enough! <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So ... what do you think?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Feel free to e-mail me directly and let me know what state you <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; &gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and what ideas you have for clues, etc. and we'll try to work <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; something out.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe I'm koo-koo, but my heart's in the right place, so that <br/>
&gt; &gt; counts <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for something; right?<br/>

Yes! Now THAT'S cool! Yes, the SHIRT is the LOGBOOK. You get it and <br/>
you got it. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So the shirt would basically BE the logbook?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Perhaps, we can carve a stamp to go with it and we can make it <br/>
an "official"<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey, everyone. I've been involved in Letterboxing for a long <br/>
&gt; time <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just love it and I've been trying to think of ways to get <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more people involved. So I printed 100 Limited Edition T-Shirts <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a cool design on them. I've gotten a bunch of people helping <br/>
&gt; me, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to bury at least 1 shirt in every state. (I also <br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; few being buried in other countries)<br/>

            Would incorporating some of this little packages of silica gel, or<br/>
<br/>
whatever it is, that you find in new shoe boxes and the like? Maybe<br/>
<br/>
also in a storage bag with a seal. Probably not totally air tight to<br/>
<br/>
allow it to breathe.<br/>

&gt; Good point. Any ideas on how to keep that from happening? Either <br/>
<br/>
&gt; include an air freshner or maybe keep the shirt sealed in a seperate <br/>
<br/>
&gt; freezer bag?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Also, the shirts will be removed in 6-12 months and cna be replaced <br/>
<br/>
&gt; by a photo or sticker that represents the shirts.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hey, everyone. I've been involved in Letterboxing for a long time <br/>
<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; I just love it and I've been trying to think of ways to get more <br/>
<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; more people involved. So I printed 100 Limited Edition T-Shirts <br/>
<br/>
&gt; with <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; a cool design on them. I've gotten a bunch of people helping me, <br/>
<br/>
&gt; but <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would like to bury at least 1 shirt in every state. (I also have <br/>
<br/>
&gt; a <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; few being buried in other countries)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; My plan is for people to find them, take a photo holding the T-<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Shirt <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; up, put their signature stamp on the back of the T-Shirt, and then <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; replace the T-Shirt for others to find. Everyone can then e-mail me <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; the photos that they took of the shirt and at the end of the year <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'll give away some cool prizes or something. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thoughts? Want to help?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'll e-mail you a T-Shirt. Your job would be to come up with some <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; awesome clues and maybe some ciphers and riddles, etc. to make it a <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; bit more interesting.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; To keep anyone from walking away with a T-Shirt, I had the shirts <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; printed extra small. Believe me, no one will be able to fit into <br/>
<br/>
&gt; one <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; of these little fellahs. Besides, why would anyone want to take one <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyway, and ruin the adventure for others? Also if they just find <br/>
<br/>
&gt; it <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; and replace it, there's a chance of winning a prize.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh, yeah, and for helping me do this I can offer you a free T-<br/>
<br/>
&gt; shirt, <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; too, or something. As if the fun of doing it wans't enough! <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; So ... what do you think?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; Feel free to e-mail me directly and let me know what state you are <br/>
<br/>
&gt; in <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; and what ideas you have for clues, etc. and we'll try to work <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; something out.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe I'm koo-koo, but my heart's in the right place, so that <br/>
<br/>
&gt; counts <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; for something; right?<br/>

In your original post you wrote "Thoughts? Want to help?, "So...What <br/>
do you think?"<br/>
<br/>
Now you want to eliminate any negative responses!<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me you want to get only the input you want!<br/>
<br/>
Posting on this board does require a bit of realization that you may <br/>
not always get the answers you like.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry but I think the idea is pretty lame, and your only wanting <br/>
those positive replys is pretty naive.<br/>
<br/>
 This is after all  a Letterboxing Chatlist geared toward <br/>
communication regarding letterboxing. That "communication" doesn't <br/>
necessarily mean only "positive" communication.<br/>

She was pretty explicit that she wanted some input. Then changed that <br/>
to only positive input. That is being pretty naive. Particularly on <br/>
this list.<br/>
 Letterboxers are probably the most independent and oppinionated bunch <br/>
of folks I know. If you ask "What do you think about_____?" you are <br/>
going to get a wealth of responses on both sides of an issue about <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
Being too PC on some subjects just doesn't seem to fit. <br/>
Calling the idea "Lame" may not be PC, but atleast she has a clear <br/>
understanding of my viewpoint.<br/>

 &gt; Maybe HIDE is a better word?<br/>
<br/>
"Plant" seems to have been the jargon settled upon, at<br/>
least in my small, perhaps out of touch view of this<br/>
world and its linguistic evolution.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Geez, we can go over these definitions forever.<br/>
<br/>
We could.  Or, we could spend more time discussing the<br/>
discussion of the idea than the idea.  Whether or not the<br/>
fact that we are doing so speaks to either the quality of<br/>
the idea or the quality of the discussers is left to the<br/>
role of the reader.<br/>
<br/>
I'll admit that I am personally always taken aback by the<br/>
suggestion that this idea or that idea is not "letterboxing",<br/>
keeping in mind that the original letterbox didn't even<br/>
contain stamps, much less the boundaries some people like to<br/>
draw around hand-carved, bespoke, or otherwise.  Me, I hate<br/>
boundaries, but that's just me.  Why is Jan 12th, 2008, the<br/>
right date to bound the game on this line?  Perhaps Jan 12th,<br/>
1860 should have been the day to bound it that it shall<br/>
contain nothing but a logbook :-)  (That would have helped<br/>
people like me who don't really care all that much about<br/>
stamp art or creating it, yet still want to find a way to<br/>
enjoy this sort of activity anyway).<br/>
<br/>
The meme market will mercilessly kill lame ideas on its<br/>
own -- no need to arbitrarily draw boundaries; doing so makes<br/>
one come off as narrow-minded, self-important, and parochial,<br/>
at least to me, and being snooty or nasty in the process only<br/>
makes it look even sillier.  JMHO, of course.  How's that for<br/>
not being PC?  (One thing I hope we all can agree on is that<br/>
we need less PC BS and more frank discourse;  Human linguistics<br/>
makes being PC impossible anyway (both the literature<br/>
and the archive of mapsurferspeak will demonstrate from a<br/>
linguistics point of view why this is so -- at least if one<br/>
accepts the general gist of the arguments from the "East Pole"<br/>
school of thought, or, perhaps, even not, but they are so<br/>
compelling, how can you not?)).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I try to avoid terms like "letterboxing" and<br/>
"letterboxes" just for these reasons -- modern "letterboxers"<br/>
have bounded them with so much baggage and boundaries.  Avoid<br/>
those terms, and you can do what you want, and no one will<br/>
get in your face about it.  That's my experience, anyway.  Call<br/>
them "shirtboxes", and people will leave you alone for sure,<br/>
since it seems clear that negative, non-constructive answers<br/>
are not desired; yet sometimes, in some peoples' minds,<br/>
negative, non-constructive answers are warranted (but, IMHO<br/>
these generally play better off-list).  I mean, I think it<br/>
is ok to say -- "I really don't like the idea, and don't really<br/>
have any suggestions, sorry.".  Most people, however, tend to<br/>
keep to themselves when they have such opinions, or find a<br/>
nice or subtle way to convey them.<br/>
<br/>
And furthermore, I would avoid the term "bury", because it<br/>
ain't PC :-) despite the fact that there seems scant<br/>
difference between moving rocks around and moving dirt around,<br/>
and 99% of the environmental damage done is placing<br/>
non-biodegradable trash in the environment, regardless of how<br/>
it is concealed.  Of course, the arguments for bury, which<br/>
you never hear, are that it is less prone to becoming visible<br/>
trash, and less likely to result in visibly destructive<br/>
"hack searches".  But I will not even hint a pro-bury platform<br/>
here, as doing so will generate more flames than walking into<br/>
a dungeon full of red dragons, and lord knows, the list don't<br/>
need that, does it?<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, it wouldn't be a mapsurferspeak post without<br/>
mentioning the word semiotics.<br/>

intelligent and well-intentioned reply.<br/>
<br/>
OK, well, it does seem impossible that anyone in the world can make <br/>
everyone happy, so I guess I can just keep changing the words that I <br/>
have used that people don't seem to like, so, if ayone would like to <br/>
be part of "planting" T-Shirt boxes, where the T-HSirt is the actual <br/>
log book and wants to be part of somehting a little different (that <br/>
includes sharing this idea with others and you yourself following <br/>
clues and maybe finding one .... then everyone is welcome to keep in <br/>
touch with me, or just check in and see how it's comng along ... and <br/>
let's see if we can all do continue to try to different things to <br/>
keep the adventures fresh and exciting for all. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, everyone for their feedback. And as for those who have kindly <br/>
touched base and offered to help --- I'll e-mail ya in a day or so, <br/>
OK?<br/>

&gt; world and its linguistic evolution.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Geez, we can go over these definitions forever.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We could.  Or, we could spend more time discussing the<br/>
&gt; discussion of the idea than the idea.  Whether or not the<br/>
&gt; fact that we are doing so speaks to either the quality of<br/>
&gt; the idea or the quality of the discussers is left to the<br/>
&gt; role of the reader.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll admit that I am personally always taken aback by the<br/>
&gt; suggestion that this idea or that idea is not "letterboxing",<br/>
&gt; keeping in mind that the original letterbox didn't even<br/>
&gt; contain stamps, much less the boundaries some people like to<br/>
&gt; draw around hand-carved, bespoke, or otherwise.  Me, I hate<br/>
&gt; boundaries, but that's just me.  Why is Jan 12th, 2008, the<br/>
&gt; right date to bound the game on this line?  Perhaps Jan 12th,<br/>
&gt; 1860 should have been the day to bound it that it shall<br/>
&gt; contain nothing but a logbook :-)  (That would have helped<br/>
&gt; people like me who don't really care all that much about<br/>
&gt; stamp art or creating it, yet still want to find a way to<br/>
&gt; enjoy this sort of activity anyway).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The meme market will mercilessly kill lame ideas on its<br/>
&gt; own -- no need to arbitrarily draw boundaries; doing so makes<br/>
&gt; one come off as narrow-minded, self-important, and parochial,<br/>
&gt; at least to me, and being snooty or nasty in the process only<br/>
&gt; makes it look even sillier.  JMHO, of course.  How's that for<br/>
&gt; not being PC?  (One thing I hope we all can agree on is that<br/>
&gt; we need less PC BS and more frank discourse;  Human linguistics<br/>
&gt; makes being PC impossible anyway (both the literature<br/>
&gt; and the archive of mapsurferspeak will demonstrate from a<br/>
&gt; linguistics point of view why this is so -- at least if one<br/>
&gt; accepts the general gist of the arguments from the "East Pole"<br/>
&gt; school of thought, or, perhaps, even not, but they are so<br/>
&gt; compelling, how can you not?)).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I try to avoid terms like "letterboxing" and<br/>
&gt; "letterboxes" just for these reasons -- modern "letterboxers"<br/>
&gt; have bounded them with so much baggage and boundaries.  Avoid<br/>
&gt; those terms, and you can do what you want, and no one will<br/>
&gt; get in your face about it.  That's my experience, anyway.  Call<br/>
&gt; them "shirtboxes", and people will leave you alone for sure,<br/>
&gt; since it seems clear that negative, non-constructive answers<br/>
&gt; are not desired; yet sometimes, in some peoples' minds,<br/>
&gt; negative, non-constructive answers are warranted (but, IMHO<br/>
&gt; these generally play better off-list).  I mean, I think it<br/>
&gt; is ok to say -- "I really don't like the idea, and don't really<br/>
&gt; have any suggestions, sorry.".  Most people, however, tend to<br/>
&gt; keep to themselves when they have such opinions, or find a<br/>
&gt; nice or subtle way to convey them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And furthermore, I would avoid the term "bury", because it<br/>
&gt; ain't PC :-) despite the fact that there seems scant<br/>
&gt; difference between moving rocks around and moving dirt around,<br/>
&gt; and 99% of the environmental damage done is placing<br/>
&gt; non-biodegradable trash in the environment, regardless of how<br/>
&gt; it is concealed.  Of course, the arguments for bury, which<br/>
&gt; you never hear, are that it is less prone to becoming visible<br/>
&gt; trash, and less likely to result in visibly destructive<br/>
&gt; "hack searches".  But I will not even hint a pro-bury platform<br/>
&gt; here, as doing so will generate more flames than walking into<br/>
&gt; a dungeon full of red dragons, and lord knows, the list don't<br/>
&gt; need that, does it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And, of course, it wouldn't be a mapsurferspeak post without<br/>
&gt; mentioning the word semiotics.<br/>

Personally I am not really sure I understand what this has to do with letterboxing?  If I understand it, there would be some t-shirts buried without logbooks and without rubber stamps.  Okay correct me if I am wrong, but I see a few problems here...<br/>
<br/>
-  letterboxers do not bury things<br/>
-  letterboxes contain logbooks<br/>
-  letterboxes contain rubber stamps.<br/>
<br/>
In some sense of creativity this might be a fun idea of some kind, but where exactly does it fit into letterboxing?  And all these people that have become involved in letterboxing because of this, do they understand that letterboxing is about looking for plastic containers with logbooks and rubber stamps, not running around with a shovel looking for buried t-shirts?<br/>

  But that's not what the original poster complained about. Amber said:<br/>
<br/>
  "By the way, if you have nothing nice to say, please don't say<br/>
  anything at all. I already generated a great deal of interest by a<br/>
  whole bunch of people, and I personally got 14 NEW people involved in<br/>
  Letterboxing simply by talking about this idea, so once again ... if<br/>
  you have nothing nice to say .... say nothing.<br/>
<br/>
  On the other hand, positve ideas and suggestions are always welcome."<br/>
<br/>
  This is basically saying that if a person is going to post a reply with<br/>
  ANYthing negative, regardless of delivery, they shouldn't post it. Nice try<br/>
  but that ain't gonna happen on this list. :-)<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe try the newboxers list?<br/>
<br/>
  I was rather shocked myself with the idea of "burying" t-shirts since<br/>
  "burying" isn't what letterboxing is really about. In my opinion. But then<br/>
  I wouldn't want to be called elitist by those who may now be into carrying<br/>
  around shovels for burying and unburying letterboxes and t-shirts. :-)<br/>
<br/>
  My Cockapoo (The Princess) and Pug (Her Pea) are both excited about the idea<br/>
  tho...........of course, being rather small in stature, they're figuring on<br/>
  just stealing the t-shirts since I refuse to buy them any fancy doggie<br/>
  fashionwear. So I'll be busy trying to explain to them that t-shirts are<br/>
  not the latest thing in first finder certificates. They respectfully<br/>
  suggest that you consider also burying a knucklebone or two. They figure<br/>
  that if they get the t-shirt, Elmer the Redbone Coonhound should get<br/>
  something good too and a buried knucklebone is the best kind of knucklebone.<br/>
  They add that, of course, whatever box they go in search of will have to<br/>
  contain TWO t-shirts because while The Pea doesn't mind sharing at all, The<br/>
  Princess does NOT do sharing.<br/>

&gt; Hey, everyone. I've been involved in Letterboxing<br/>
&gt; for a long time and <br/>
&gt; I just love it and I've been trying to think of ways<br/>
&gt; to get more and <br/>
&gt; more people involved. So I printed 100 Limited<br/>
&gt; Edition T-Shirts with <br/>
&gt; a cool design on them. I've gotten a bunch of people<br/>
&gt; helping me, but <br/>
&gt; I would like to bury at least 1 shirt in every<br/>
&gt; state. (I also have a <br/>
&gt; few being buried in other countries)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My plan is for people to find them, take a photo<br/>
&gt; holding the T-Shirt <br/>
&gt; up, put their signature stamp on the back of the<br/>
&gt; T-Shirt, and then <br/>
&gt; replace the T-Shirt for others to find. Everyone can<br/>
&gt; then e-mail me <br/>
&gt; the photos that they took of the shirt and at the<br/>
&gt; end of the year <br/>
&gt; I'll give away some cool prizes or something. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thoughts? Want to help?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll e-mail you a T-Shirt. Your job would be to come<br/>
&gt; up with some <br/>
&gt; awesome clues and maybe some ciphers and riddles,<br/>
&gt; etc. to make it a <br/>
&gt; bit more interesting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To keep anyone from walking away with a T-Shirt, I<br/>
&gt; had the shirts <br/>
&gt; printed extra small. Believe me, no one will be able<br/>
&gt; to fit into one <br/>
&gt; of these little fellahs. Besides, why would anyone<br/>
&gt; want to take one <br/>
&gt; anyway, and ruin the adventure for others? Also if<br/>
&gt; they just find it <br/>
&gt; and replace it, there's a chance of winning a prize.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, yeah, and for helping me do this I can offer you<br/>
&gt; a free T-shirt, <br/>
&gt; too, or something. As if the fun of doing it wans't<br/>
&gt; enough! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So ... what do you think?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feel free to e-mail me directly and let me know what<br/>
&gt; state you are in <br/>
&gt; and what ideas you have for clues, etc. and we'll<br/>
&gt; try to work <br/>
&gt; something out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I'm koo-koo, but my heart's in the right<br/>
&gt; place, so that counts <br/>
&gt; for something; right?<br/>

stating that she only wanted positive feedback.   How many "positive" ways<br/>
are there for a person to say they feel an idea is lame?  There's not really<br/>
a "nice" way to say that.<br/>
<br/>
On another note.............my problem with the use of the word "bury" lies<br/>
in the fact that Amber seems to be very excited that she's turning on new<br/>
people to this pasttime right and left.  Is she carefully explaining the<br/>
fact that her definition of "bury" might not fit the dictionary definition<br/>
of "bury"?  My dictionary has "bury" meaning "to put in the ground and cover<br/>
with earth."  "Bury" is  synonymous with neither "hide" nor "place".  Maybe<br/>
someone else's dictionary is different than mine however.<br/>
<br/>
She might not care enough to be careful with her words but given the fact<br/>
that fewer and fewer landowners and land managers are ecstatic about having<br/>
letterboxers and geocachers hiding or placing boxes and caches on their<br/>
property, and slowly more and more are confiscating and sometimes destroying<br/>
boxes and caches, and passing rules or ordinances against them, it's not a<br/>
bad idea to be careful with words so that we have the least amount of<br/>
irresponsibility as possible out there.  A landowner or manager might feel<br/>
that digging a hole to put something underground isn't quite the same as<br/>
hiding something in an old rotten tree stump.  And newbies might not realize<br/>
that.  As the game becomes a lot more popular, it's just my opinion that<br/>
players have to begin becoming a lot more responsible since we're both more<br/>
and more in the public eye and we're attracting more and more newbies.  The<br/>
two kinda go together, eh?  And the more a face is out there front &amp; center,<br/>
the easier it is to catch a black eye or even two, as some of the political<br/>
candidates could affirm right now.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I assumed that there was going to be a stamp made for the box and that the<br/>
t-shirt would be the logbook, thus it would be a letterbox.  And really, why<br/>
not?  Anything can be a logbook if it can be stamped, I would think.<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn't interest me because I imagine it being more than a little messy<br/>
and it's unlikely the t-shirts are going to stay dry and thus will end up<br/>
full of mildew in a short time, and along with that also comes a rather<br/>
unpleasant smell.  It doesn't sound like a letterbox I'd really want to open<br/>
unless I found it fairly quickly after it was hidden.  Unless the plan is to<br/>
hide these at indoor sites.<br/>
<br/>
I don't see any advantage to perusing sig stamps stamped on a t-shirt over<br/>
perusing the sig stamps in a regular logbook.   What's so exciting about<br/>
looking at them stamped on a t-shirt?  And a t-shirt that, in the long run,<br/>
the placer isn't even going to be able to wear.<br/>
<br/>
Now that would be kinda cool..........a large enough t-shirt so that the<br/>
placer could eventually wear it........it would solve the question that gets<br/>
asked every so often on the list about what does one do with their filled<br/>
logbooks.  Wear them of course!  :-) But would they be washable?  And a lot<br/>
of markers and inks that work nicely on paper or cardstock don't work so<br/>
well on fabric. (Stazon works well on fabric.)  Of course, that could mean<br/>
an awfully large lock 'n' lock.  :-)  Again, it might work nicely with a box<br/>
placed in, say, a retail store where the employees knew what was going on.<br/>
<br/>
As far as someone's comment about letterboxing here in the U.S. not being<br/>
anything like it began in the U.K. anyway, who gives a rat's blank?  In my<br/>
opinion what would count is how letterboxing evolves in the U.S. since the<br/>
"original" idea of "how to letterbox" didn't ever show up on American shores<br/>
anyway.  So, in my opinion, it's never actually been the same game.  To me,<br/>
that's like comparing baseball and cricket.   And if anyone looks at what a<br/>
huge amount of the clues in the U.K. are like, booooorrrrring (in my<br/>
opinion.)  U.S. clues are rarely written similarly to U.K. clues.  Of<br/>
course, I find cricket dreadfully boring too.  Now rugby tho...........I'll<br/>
take rugby over football any day.  Football players are wusses.  (I'm<br/>
talking American football, not soccer.)<br/>

Of course when you ask for input, it isn't all going to be<br/>

 Personally I am not really sure I understand what this has to do with letterboxing?  If I understand it, there would be some t-shirts buried without logbooks and without rubber stamps.  Okay correct me if I am wrong, but I see a few problems here...<br/>
<br/>
 -  letterboxers do not bury things<br/>
 -  letterboxes contain logbooks<br/>
 -  letterboxes contain rubber stamps.<br/>
<br/>
 In some sense of creativity this might be a fun idea of some kind, but where exactly does it fit into letterboxing?  And all these people that have become involved in letterboxing because of this, do they understand that letterboxing is about looking for plastic containers with logbooks and rubber stamps, not running around with a shovel looking for buried t-shirts?<br/>

 But that's not what the original poster complained about. Amber said:<br/>
<br/>
 "By the way, if you have nothing nice to say, please don't say<br/>
   anything at all. I already generated a great deal of interest by a<br/>
   whole bunch of people, and I personally got 14 NEW people involved in<br/>
   Letterboxing simply by talking about this idea, so once again ... if<br/>
   you have nothing nice to say .... say nothing.<br/>
<br/>
 On the other hand, positve ideas and suggestions are always welcome."<br/>
<br/>
 This is basically saying that if a person is going to post a reply with<br/>
   ANYthing negative, regardless of delivery, they shouldn't post it. Nice try<br/>
   but that ain't gonna happen on this list. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe try the newboxers list?<br/>
<br/>
 I was rather shocked myself with the idea of "burying" t-shirts since<br/>
   "burying" isn't what letterboxing is really about. In my opinion. But then<br/>
   I wouldn't want to be called elitist by those who may now be into carrying<br/>
   around shovels for burying and unburying letterboxes and t-shirts. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 My Cockapoo (The Princess) and Pug (Her Pea) are both excited about the idea<br/>
   tho...........of course, being rather small in stature, they're figuring on<br/>
   just stealing the t-shirts since I refuse to buy them any fancy doggie<br/>
   fashionwear. So I'll be busy trying to explain to them that t-shirts are<br/>
   not the latest thing in first finder certificates. They respectfully<br/>
   suggest that you consider also burying a knucklebone or two. They figure<br/>
   that if they get the t-shirt, Elmer the Redbone Coonhound should get<br/>
   something good too and a buried knucklebone is the best kind of knucklebone.<br/>
   They add that, of course, whatever box they go in search of will have to<br/>
   contain TWO t-shirts because while The Pea doesn't mind sharing at all, The<br/>
   Princess does NOT do sharing.<br/>

&gt; Hey, everyone. I've been involved in Letterboxing for a long time <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; I just love it and I've been trying to think of ways to get more <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; more people involved. So I printed 100 Limited Edition T-Shirts <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; a cool design on them. I've gotten a bunch of people helping me, <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; I would like to bury at least 1 shirt in every state. (I also have <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; few being buried in other countries)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My plan is for people to find them, take a photo holding the T-<br/>
Shirt <br/>
&gt; up, put their signature stamp on the back of the T-Shirt, and then <br/>
&gt; replace the T-Shirt for others to find. Everyone can then e-mail me <br/>
&gt; the photos that they took of the shirt and at the end of the year <br/>
&gt; I'll give away some cool prizes or something. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thoughts? Want to help?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll e-mail you a T-Shirt. Your job would be to come up with some <br/>
&gt; awesome clues and maybe some ciphers and riddles, etc. to make it a <br/>
&gt; bit more interesting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To keep anyone from walking away with a T-Shirt, I had the shirts <br/>
&gt; printed extra small. Believe me, no one will be able to fit into <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; of these little fellahs. Besides, why would anyone want to take one <br/>
&gt; anyway, and ruin the adventure for others? Also if they just find <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; and replace it, there's a chance of winning a prize.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, yeah, and for helping me do this I can offer you a free T-<br/>
shirt, <br/>
&gt; too, or something. As if the fun of doing it wans't enough! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So ... what do you think?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feel free to e-mail me directly and let me know what state you are <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; and what ideas you have for clues, etc. and we'll try to work <br/>
&gt; something out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I'm koo-koo, but my heart's in the right place, so that <br/>
counts <br/>
&gt; for something; right?<br/>

Well, maybe "Sue" did, but I didn't do any technical research.  It just<br/>
seemed like your kind of shenanigans.  Then what made me even more<br/>
suspicious was the comment "Beside,s I have ten people in Chicago that<br/>
already offered to help."  I know a lot of boxers in that area and I found<br/>
it hard to believe they'd get involved with something as silly as burying a<br/>
t-shirt.<br/>

&gt; logbooks and without rubber stamps.  Okay correct me if I am wrong, but I see a <br/>
&gt; few problems here...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -  letterboxers do not bury things<br/>
&gt; -  letterboxes contain logbooks<br/>
&gt; -  letterboxes contain rubber stamps.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In some sense of creativity this might be a fun idea of some kind, but where <br/>
&gt; exactly does it fit into letterboxing?  And all these people that have become <br/>
&gt; involved in letterboxing because of this, do they understand that letterboxing <br/>
&gt; is about looking for plastic containers with logbooks and rubber stamps, not <br/>
&gt; running around with a shovel looking for buried t-shirts?<br/>

&gt; Hey, everyone. I've been involved in Letterboxing for a long time <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; I just love it and I've been trying to think of ways to get more <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; more people involved. So I printed 100 Limited Edition T-Shirts <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; a cool design on them. I've gotten a bunch of people helping me, <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; I would like to bury at least 1 shirt in every state. (I also have <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; few being buried in other countries)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My plan is for people to find them, take a photo holding the T-<br/>
Shirt <br/>
&gt; up, put their signature stamp on the back of the T-Shirt, and then <br/>
&gt; replace the T-Shirt for others to find. Everyone can then e-mail <br/>
me <br/>
&gt; the photos that they took of the shirt and at the end of the year <br/>
&gt; I'll give away some cool prizes or something. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thoughts? Want to help?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll e-mail you a T-Shirt. Your job would be to come up with some <br/>
&gt; awesome clues and maybe some ciphers and riddles, etc. to make it <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; bit more interesting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To keep anyone from walking away with a T-Shirt, I had the shirts <br/>
&gt; printed extra small. Believe me, no one will be able to fit into <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; of these little fellahs. Besides, why would anyone want to take <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; anyway, and ruin the adventure for others? Also if they just find <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; and replace it, there's a chance of winning a prize.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, yeah, and for helping me do this I can offer you a free T-<br/>
shirt, <br/>
&gt; too, or something. As if the fun of doing it wans't enough! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So ... what do you think?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feel free to e-mail me directly and let me know what state you are <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; and what ideas you have for clues, etc. and we'll try to work <br/>
&gt; something out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I'm koo-koo, but my heart's in the right place, so that <br/>
