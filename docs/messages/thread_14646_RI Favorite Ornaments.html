I'm in RI and was lloking for your ornanment series. I found Mushroom but <br/>
due to Max whining and the mosquitoes I left after wandering around the <br/>
junkyard for a while. I'm thinking maybe the path is a bit more overgrown or <br/>
something......could you help me out? I really want your broken heart <br/>
ornament!<br/>
<br/>
Also Java Man HH was seen wandering around Burlington Camping Park!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

&gt;i was just thinking.....and this has probably been thought of by<br/>
&gt;someone already ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;on the rest stop boxes how about when they are posted/reposted that<br/>
&gt;at the beginning of the name a designation RS--YOUR LETTERBOX<br/>
&gt;NAME....or RS__YOUR LETTERBOX NAME.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;that way scrolling thru the lists it would be easy to spot a rest<br/>
&gt;area box without having to go in and out of all the different clues<br/>
&gt;looking for them???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;just a thought and maybe already addressed....<br/>

TeamGreenDragon and the Pepe's began looking for this series<br/>

&gt; Hi Beth,<br/>
&gt; TeamGreenDragon and the Pepe's began looking for this series<br/>
&gt; on Saturday. The Path is VERY overgrown and if if wasn't for<br/>

&gt; the snakes for us - we would have missed the trail. However,<br/>
&gt; once you get past that grassy area, the path becomes lovely<br/>
