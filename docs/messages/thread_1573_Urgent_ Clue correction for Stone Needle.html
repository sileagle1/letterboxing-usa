place a gift certificate in it towards a meal at a local restaurant.  <br/>
The box was in good condition after its first week out there. We got <br/>
heavy rain and snow since I left it last Saturday.  While walking to <br/>
it I checked my pacing on the second to last course.  To my horror I <br/>
found that I was off by 10 paces.  The distance should be 50 paces <br/>
instead of 60.  I use a "2 step" pace.  I count them while walking <br/>
with a casual gate.  I'll be updating my clue page later today.<br/>
<br/>
Well, anyway, the box weathered quite well over the last week.  The <br/>
spot I put it in seems like it was made for it.  There's snow up <br/>
there and the local ski areas are making their own already. <br/>
<br/>
After a few thaws and refreezes you may have to chop the ice away to <br/>
get into it, but the box itself should be secure.  Don't forget that <br/>
the gift certificate is only good for a year. When the snow gets <br/>
deep, you're going to have to do a lot more hiking, x-country skiing <br/>
or snowshoeing to get close to it.  They don't plow all the roads in <br/>
this area in the winter.<br/>
<br/>
I'm anxious to hear about the first attempt.  The gift certificate <br/>
already has the letterbox stamp on it.  <br/>
<br/>
good luck,<br/>
<br/>
