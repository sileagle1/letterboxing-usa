A <br/>
&gt; &gt; few months ago, I learned about letterboxing and was extremely <br/>
&gt; &gt; excited to start participating in the adventure.  Over the past <br/>
&gt; &gt; couple of months I have placed and located several boxes in my <br/>
&gt; &gt; area.  I received a message from Glenn (of Tacoma) the day I <br/>
placed <br/>
&gt; &gt; my first letterbox (in July, I think) that included a video of <br/>
&gt; their <br/>
&gt; &gt; antics at my letterbox that I placed in my hometown near the <br/>
&gt; Seattle <br/>
&gt; &gt; area.  I perceived the 15 second video clip they included as <br/>
&gt; &gt; something pretty jovial and sort of a gentle 'hazing' to welcome <br/>
me <br/>
&gt; &gt; into the sport of letterboxing.  I took it as a friendly gesture <br/>
&gt; not <br/>
&gt; &gt; as a threat or intimidation.  The video suggested that they found <br/>
&gt; &gt; the box and simply tossed it in the general location of its <br/>
actual <br/>
&gt; &gt; hiding place and left without putting it back.  This was just a <br/>
&gt; &gt; joke, upon further inspection, the letterbox was actual re-hidden <br/>
&gt; &gt; safe and sound in its intended hiding place.  I'm not sure what <br/>
&gt; else <br/>
&gt; &gt; has transpired in this community regarding the various men in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Seattle/Tacoma area.  I just want to defend Glenn in this <br/>
&gt; particular <br/>
&gt; &gt; case as I never felt threatened or intimidated by his antics in <br/>
&gt; this <br/>
&gt; &gt; case.<br/>

     I apologize for bringing this up again.  This whole NUCLEAR <br/>
BOMB event on this website almost made me want to quit this sport <br/>
entirely a few weeks ago!!!  I am defending Glenn in this instance <br/>
because apparently a video clip of him finding my box was sent to <br/>
somebody else involved in this sport (I have no idea to whom--<br/>
because I never sent it to anyone--I have an antiquated and slower <br/>
than Heinz Ketchup dialup connection) and they interpreted it as <br/>
threatening.  If my box was the only one involved with the videotape <br/>
and there are comments that this action was threatening or <br/>
intimidating to me, I am here to say that I wasn't threatened or <br/>
intimidated in the least.  I knew it was a joke from the outset and <br/>
thought I was merely being 'welcomed into the world of letterboxing'-<br/>
-these sorts of jokes are often played on people who join new <br/>
organizations (ex:  rookies in major league baseball--Ichiro had ALL <br/>
SORTS of jokes played on him in the Seattle lockerroom/flights <br/>
during his rookie year with the Mariners).  I don't condone whatever <br/>
else Glenn or anybody else has done or said on the board that was <br/>
spiteful or vindictive, I am just defending him in this case with <br/>
the video footage--when we received the video we literally fell out <br/>
of our seats laughing so hard that we couldn't continue doing <br/>
anything else for the evening!!!<br/>
<br/>
    I don't remember all of the trash that transpired on this <br/>
message board during that awful time a few months back, but I don't <br/>
condone any mistreatment of anybody involved in this sport or on <br/>
this message board.  If he was unkind or threatening to you during <br/>
that time, then I hope he is man enough to stand up and apologize.  <br/>
That's what I would expect of my children, husband or friends, too. <br/>
I personally believed that Lizardbutt (or his mom) were indeed who <br/>
they suggested they were in their messages (and I still do). <br/>
<br/>
     I think that some folks are purists about the sport of <br/>
letterboxing and hope that it would continue to follow the rules or <br/>
the 'spirit of the founding fathers of letterboxing'.  Perhaps he is <br/>
one of those individuals?  No clue, since I don't know him other <br/>
than an email with a video attached to it of him finding 2 of my <br/>
letterboxes and jokingly tossing them to the side.<br/>
<br/>
     I personally know, however, that sarcasm/pessism/cynisism <br/>
(whatever it is) doesn't convey well through emails/messages (that <br/>
is why I use emoticons whenever I can).  I, too, am a sarcastic <br/>
person and often times things I say are misinterpreted.  My own <br/>
family often doesn't get my jokes.  People are just different!  My <br/>
own two children are EXTREME OPPOSITES with the same 2 parents!!! <br/>
Hopefully, this whole episode will just settle itself because I want <br/>
to continue on with this really cool hobby. <br/>
<br/>
     I hope I have properly conveyed my feelings here.  It is quite <br/>
late at night and I'm not thinking very clearly as my children and I <br/>
are all sick right now with some sort of flu.  Perhaps I'll think <br/>
more clearly in the morning?  <br/>
