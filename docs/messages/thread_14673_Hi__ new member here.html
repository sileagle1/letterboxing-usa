Welcome to a wonderful hobby!  You are going to love it.  I was hooked last<br/>
spring and have become a woman obsessed since :-)  Some resources that I<br/>
found helpful are the getting started link on the LBNA website<br/>
(www.letterboxing.org) and a letterboxer named Ryan has a page that he did<br/>
that has some of the straight up as far as answering some of the questions<br/>
that some don't always dare ask as newbies.  It is located at<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/Docs/Newbies/  Ryan is currently hiking<br/>
the Appalachian Trail, so if you see references to Ryan or "the Green<br/>
Turtle"  that's who they are talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you on the trail.  Oh, and while I'm here I'll put in a<br/>
shameless plug. If you ever make it out to Idaho, let me know.  If you are<br/>
still interested in ghost towns, I am planting a series next week in a ghost<br/>
town here in ID.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
