I just wanted to share something that you all may know but that I <br/>
learned about this past week while letterboxing with my small <br/>
children.  Baby wipes make a wonderful stamp cleaner.  I have a small <br/>
flat container that is for a diaper bag that holds wipes, it also fits <br/>
perfectly into the small backpack that we keep our letterboxing stamps, <br/>
logbooks, and ink in.  After stamping I now wipe off my stamp as well <br/>
as the stamp of the letterbox that I am visiting.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In previous posts on this and other letterboxing lists, the general <br/>
consensus is that baby wipes are not appropriate for use on hand-<br/>
carved stamps since they contain ingredients that may penetrate <br/>
and/or react to the carving medium.  Note also that there are alcohol <br/>
based stamp cleaners available specifically for cleaning commercial <br/>
stamps  that come in small "dauber" type bottles. <br/>
<br/>
If you must clean a hand carved stamp before/after you use it, simply <br/>
carry a cloth or paper towel moistened with water and wipe it off as <br/>
best as you can. That way there is no lingering scent or harmful <br/>
chemicals present that could compromise the letterbox location vis a <br/>
vis animals or cause its stamp to deteriorate.<br/>

the problem is that if you smell them, you will see that stamp cleaners <br/>

However, as a suggestion, I've found that when I place boxes, I wrap<br/>
my carved masterpieces in a piece of felt or a sturdy cotton to soak<br/>
up the ink over long-term boxing usage. I find that it also eliminates<br/>
the nasty soggy paper towel syndrome.<br/>

I'm sure you were already aware of this, but - <br/>
DHMO is dihydrogen monoxide... di meaning "two" and mon meaning "one", <br/>
so it's more common chemical symbol is H2O... or better yet, <br/>
just "water".  The website you cited is a chemist's idea of a joke...<br/>
