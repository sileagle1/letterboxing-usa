Make Money NOW ** This Really Does Works just read  **<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have been on the Internet for 10 years now, and have received in my <br/>
e-mail many many times letters referring to making money, and like <br/>
most of us I have ignored them  anyway a few weeks ago I decided to <br/>
see what would happen, so as an experiment, as I had heard quite good <br/>
reports about this scheme over the last few years. <br/>
<br/>
A little while back I was browsing through newsgroups, just like you <br/>
are now, and came across an article similar to this, that said you <br/>
could make thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial <br/>
investment of $12.00. So I thought " Yea right this must be a scam," <br/>
but like most of us I was curious, so I kept reading.<br/>
Anyway it said that you send only $2.00 dollars to each of the 6 <br/>
names, and addresses stated in the article.<br/>
You then place your own name, and address in the bottom of the list <br/>
at number 6, and post the article in at least 100 newsgroups. [There <br/>
are hundreds of thousands of them] no catch, and that was it.<br/>
<br/>
So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, <br/>
[especially the legal issue.] I thought about trying it. I figured <br/>
what have I got to loose except 6 stamps, and $12.00 right!!!<br/>
Then I invested the measly $12.00. Well GUESS WHAT!! Within 7 days. I <br/>
started getting money in the mail I was shocked !! I figured it would <br/>
end soon, but the money just kept coming in.<br/>
In my first week I had made about $70.00, and by the end of the <br/>
second week I made a total of over $1000.00. In the third week, I had <br/>
over $10,000.00, and it is still growing. <br/>
This is now my fourth week, and I have made a total of just over <br/>
$42,000.00, and it's still coming in rapidly<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you how this works, and most importantly WHY it works. <br/>
Firstly make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so that you <br/>
can get the information off as you need.<br/>
I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly, that you <br/>
will start making more than you ever thought possible, by doing <br/>
something so easy.!!<br/>
Read this entire message carefully. Print it out or download it.  <br/>
Follow the simple directions, and watch the money come in. It's easy <br/>
IMPORTANT: This is not a rip off, it is not indecent, it is <br/>
completely LEGAL, and it is 99% no risk  it really works.!! If all <br/>
of the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive <br/>
extraordinary dividends.  <br/>
<br/>
PLEASE NOTE: Follow these directions EXACTLY, and $50,00.00 or more <br/>
can be yours in 20 to 60 days. This programme remains successful <br/>
because of the honesty, and integrity of the participants.  Please <br/>
continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions.  You <br/>
will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business <br/>
your product is not sold, and tangible, it's a service. You are in <br/>
the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many large corporations are <br/>
happy to pay for quality lists, however the money made from Mailing <br/>
Lists is secondary to the income which is made from people like you, <br/>
and me asking to be include in that list. Here are the 3 easy steps <br/>
to success:<br/>
<br/>
Step One: Get 6 separate pieces of paper, and write your name, and <br/>
address plus the following on each piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON <br/>
YOUR MAILING" LIST" <br/>
Now get 12 US $1.00 dollars, and place TWO inside each of the 6 <br/>
pieces of paper so that the $2.00 will not be seen through the <br/>
envelope [ to prevent thievery. ] Next place one of the sheets of <br/>
paper in each of the envelopes, and seal them. You would now have 6 <br/>
sealed envelopes each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, <br/>
your name, and address, and TWO $1.00 NOTES. <br/>
What you are doing is creating a service, and you are paying for it. <br/>
Like most of us I was sceptical, and a little worried about the legal <br/>
aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office Tel: <br/>
1-800-725-2161, and they confirmed that it was indeed legal. NOW mail <br/>
the 6 envelopes to the following addresses:-<br/>
<br/>
1.	Mark Coll / 45 The Leys / Bishopbriggs /Glasgow / G64 1PP /   <br/>
        U.K.<br/>
<br/>
2.	Manuel Tinajero / 542 Hernandez / Laredo / Texas / 78046 / <br/>
        U.S.A. <br/>
<br/>
3.	R.C. Falk / 7509 NE Van Mall Dr. C-13 / Vancover / <br/>
        Washington / 98662 / U.S.A.<br/>
<br/>
4.	Ray Burrus / 383 Hill Street / Waterbury / Connecticut / <br/>
        06704 / U.S.A.<br/>
<br/>
5.	Fitzgerald Johnson / 203 Flannery Ct/ Fountain inn sc 29644<br/>
<br/>
6.	Noel Reid / 4 Lynnehurst Park / Comber / Newtownards /   <br/>
        N.Ireland / BT23 5LW/  United Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
Step Two: Now take the No. 1 name off the list that you see above, <br/>
and move the other names up the list so that 6 becomes 5, and 5 <br/>
becomes 4, etc, and then add your own name, and address as number 6 <br/>
on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Step Three: Change anything that you think needs to be changed, but <br/>
try to keep this as close to the original as possible. Now post this <br/>
amended article to at least 100 newsgroups. [ there are close to <br/>
450,000 groups on Yahoo Groups alone. ]  All you need is 100, but <br/>
remember the more you post, the more money that you make!  You won't <br/>
get very much unless you post like crazy!!<br/>
This is perfectly legal. If you have any doubts refer to Title 18 <br/>
Sec., 1302 &amp; 1341 of the International Postal Lottery Act.<br/>
Keep a copy of these steps for yourself, and whenever you need money, <br/>
you can use it again, and again. Please remember that this programme <br/>
remains successful because of the Honesty, and Integrity of the <br/>
participants, and by their careful adhering to the directions.    <br/>
Look at it this way, if you have Integrity, the programme will <br/>
continue, and the money that so many others have received will come <br/>
your way.<br/>
<br/>
Note: You may want to retain every name, and address sent to you, <br/>
either on your computer or hard copy, and keep the notes that people <br/>
send to you. <br/>
This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service.  [ Also it <br/>
might be a good idea to wrap the $1.00 bills in a dark paper to <br/>
reduce the risk of mail theft ] So as each post is downloaded, and <br/>
directions carefully followed. Six members will be reimbursed for <br/>
their participation as a List Developer, with $2.00 each. Your name <br/>
will be moved up the list geometrically so that when your name <br/>
reaches the Number 1 position you will be receiving tens of thousands <br/>
of dollars in CASH !!<br/>
What an opportunity for only $12.00. [ $2.00 for each of the six <br/>
listed above ]  <br/>
Send it now, and add your name to the list, and your in business.<br/>
<br/>
Note: Send only US dollars  in this programme as the US dollar always <br/>
has a stable exchange rate, and is easily available to people outside <br/>
the US. If you live outside the US then please exchange local <br/>
currency into $12 single US Dollar bills. Exchanging money into US $ <br/>
is cheap, and easy, and can be done at most Banks, Post Offices or <br/>
Embassies, and even some Super Markets. It will all be worth it when <br/>
you start receiving thousands of Dollars in the mail. Also letters to <br/>
places other than your own country. It is a good idea to send them <br/>
airmail, and not by Land, there is not a lot of difference in price <br/>
for this.<br/>
<br/>
*******POSTING TO NEWSGROUPS*******<br/>
<br/>
STEP ONE: You do not need to type this entire letter to do your own <br/>
posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter, drag <br/>
your cursor to the bottom of this document, and select copy from the <br/>
edit menu. Open a blank note pad file, and place the cursor at the <br/>
top of the document, and then select paste from the edit menu.<br/>
Then delete the first name, and address at number 1, make the second <br/>
name, and address  number 1, and so on. Then add your name, and <br/>
address to number 6. Then save the file as a TXT file so that you <br/>
have the file to go back to.<br/>
<br/>
STEP TWO: Using Netscape or Internet Explorer try searching for <br/>
various newsgroups <br/>
[ on - line forums, message boards, chat sites, discussion boards, <br/>
etc ]  One of the largest newsgroups can be found at Yahoo Groups <br/>
http://groups. Yahoo.com and ListBot at<br/>
http://listbot.com.   Also if you use Outlook Express, and Netscape <br/>
Messenger you will have access to hundred of thousands of newsgroups <br/>
worldwide. Visit these newsgroups, guestbooks, and message boards <br/>
etc, and post this article as a new message by highlighting the text <br/>
of this letter selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the <br/>
subject header, and do try to think of something that a curious <br/>
person can't resist from checking, and that's all there is to it so <br/>
keep posting in the newsgroups it only takes a matter of seconds.<br/>
There is a faster way, if you use Microsoft Outlook or Outlook <br/>
Express to select newsgroups rapidly. You only need a one time copy, <br/>
and paste to send to all of them automatically.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
REMEMBER THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST THE MORE YOU GET<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You have to post a minimum of 100, and that's it.  You will then <br/>
start receiving money from around the world in a matter of days.<br/>
You may want to rent a P.O. Box due to the large amount of mail you <br/>
will receive. If you want to stay anonymous you can invent a name to <br/>
use, as long as the postal service will deliver it.<br/>
Get all your work colleagues or school friends involved, also talk it <br/>
over with all your friends or simply post it to everyone in your e-<br/>
mail address book.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here Are Some Useful Links, But Remember There Are Thousands More<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo Groups         http://groups.yahoo.com<br/>
Smartgroups            http://smartgroup.com<br/>
Yahoo Clubs            http://clubs.yahoo.com<br/>
Listbot                      http://www.listbot.com<br/>
MSN Communities http://communities.msn.com<br/>
Bravenet Forums    http://www.bravenet.com<br/>
Ezboard                   http://www.ezboard.com<br/>
<br/>
REMEMBER: This programme relies on the Honesty and Integrity of the <br/>
People Involved. We are in a WIN WIN situation basically what we are <br/>
doing, is helping each<br/>
Other to get enough money to afford those basic things that we <br/>
desperately want with a lot more extra cash.  <br/>
So you have posted this message on at least 100 newsgroups you, get 5 <br/>
responses to begin with. Each of the 5 persons sends you $2.00 . <br/>
These 5 people now make the MINIMUM 100 postings each with your name <br/>
at number 5, and 5 people respond to each of the original 5 that is <br/>
another $50.00 for you, now those 25 each make 100 MINIMUM posting <br/>
with your name at number 4, and only 5 replies each, this will bring <br/>
in an additional $1250.00, and you can see it just goes on and on.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck everybody this works, and I am sorry that I have been a <br/>
sceptic for all these years, and now I am kicking myself for ignoring <br/>
those e-mails, because by now I could have been very, very wealthy.<br/>
