Saturday, but here's the official reminder about the gathering.  We are so excited <br/>
about the response we have received - it's clear that there is a lot of interest in our <br/>
wonderful hobby in these parts.  To whet your whistle, here's what we know will be <br/>
there on Saturday for sure:<br/>
<br/>
12 planted letterboxes (one is transient)<br/>
<br/>
1 event stamp for that day only<br/>
<br/>
3 traveling event stamps<br/>
<br/>
between 20-25 letterboxers who have RSVP'ed so far, including dignitaries coming in <br/>
from Pennsylvania, Idaho, Seattle and San Luis Obispo - the "X"s will be flying!<br/>
<br/>
several hitchhikers that I know of, plus the "You've Got Mail" hitchhiker exchange <br/>
mailbox<br/>
<br/>
carving and stamping demonstrations<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For all the details, here's that link one more time:<br/>

<br/>
Please remember that food and refreshments are BYO, but we'll provide the coals and <br/>
the entertainment!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing everyone there.<br/>
