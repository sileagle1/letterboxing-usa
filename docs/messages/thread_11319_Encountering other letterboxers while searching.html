I would like some advice about what to do if you meet others while <br/>
out searching for clues. I think this happened to me this winter. I <br/>
was concentrating on my compass readings, looked up and saw 2 people <br/>
mere yards ahead of me.  I quietly left.  The references to stamping <br/>
in seem to indicate it is o.k. make contact. As a fairly new <br/>
letterboxer living in the letterbox-rich area of Mansfield, I am very <br/>
likely to run across other folks. In fact, while out hiking, carrying <br/>
my letterboxing gear, I am always on the lookout for fellow hikers <br/>
with  ink stained fingers and crumpled maps. How do others deal with <br/>
chance encounters?<br/>

O.K. to approach them.... just don't feed them! <grin>  All kidding <br/>
aside, and as a new letterboxer I would definately say hi.  You'll <br/>
probably put a name with the face and get a stamp in exchange.  I <br/>
think if i came away with one thing from Patrick and Amy bringing us <br/>
to the CT Kids day last October, its the fact that pretty much <br/>
everyone is extremely friendly and equally excited to meet people on <br/>
the trail!  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else share this sentiment???<br/>

                    <html><body>Hi Elaine!  I've had some success finding other letterboxers on the trail and I thought that I would share some "secrets" with you!  (actually, they are not secrets.... just things that I have heard before, and that I use :-)
<br/>
<br/>When you are out boxing, look to see if the people have pieces of paper in their hands.  That would be a huge tip off, since ordinary hikers probably wouldn't have this in their hands.
<br/>
<br/>Also, check to see if they have an LBNA patch on their backpack (I do, and I know Butterfly has one on her pouch), or when you are parking in the lot, take a casual glance at the other cars parked (if there are any) to see if you see a LBNA bumper sticker or clingie.  If they get there after you however, this won't work!  ;-)
<br/>
<br/>When I'm out on the trail and at a particular spot notated in the clues (Like a trail intersection or particular rock), and someone who perhaps is a boxer is approaching, I stop and sit or lean against a tree, take a sip of water, or take a quick bite of snack, and observe.  Sometimes you can figure out if they are a boxer by how they approach.  For example, I met Bonsai and Little La (and crew) this way.  I was checking out two large flat rocks for a box, and when I saw them approaching, I stopped and sat on the rocks, took a sip of water, and waited.  When they saw me, they stopped approaching.  When Bonsai took out his clues, that was a major tip off!
<br/>We never found the box due to all of the snow... but it was great to get five exchanges from it!
<br/>
<br/>The other way I've meet people on trail is when I was stamping into a box they were looking for.  That's the most obvious and requires no detective work on your part.  I've met Letterboxer2002, Wanda and Pete this way!  I go up to the boxer and say "I'm SO glad you found it for me!"  LOL  Actually, when I met Letterboxer2002, I was the one stamping into the box and he was the one coming down the trail, however, he had already gotten the box.  
<br/>
<br/>Hope this helps you... and hope to see you on the trail this summer!  I'm going to be VERY busy in Mansfield this year!
