I case you-all didn't know ......... If you enter this list from the <br/>
Letterbox North America site, you don't need to be a member.  If you enter <br/>
from Yahoo! Groups you do.<br/>
<br/>
----  Maybe that explains why I can't go "home" as was suggested - I came in <br/>
through LbNA.  ...and Glenn...I caught that crack about if some of us can't <br/>
find our way around a computer we might be inept trying to follow <br/>
clues...but I followed yours, didn't I?  :o)  I'm much handier in the woods <br/>
than I am at a desk...<br/>

The one time I show a bit of compassion for my fellow man Lucy comes along<br/>
and slaps me down with a cheap shot! Ouch!<br/>
<br/>
Fine! Fry the newbies with a virus and feed them to the worms!<br/>
Hmmm......maybe a theme for a letter box for someone special.<br/>
Lucy, if you come back to Washington let me know ahead of time.   :-)<br/>
