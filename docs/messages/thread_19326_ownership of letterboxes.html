well-being.  But who's definition of accountability will be used?  Perhaps the placer <br/>
only checks the box once every couple of years.  Maybe they have a new e-mail <br/>
address and haven't bothered to list it with the on-line letterboxing site.  <br/>
Perhaps they don't recognize your address or intentions and delete your message <br/>
w/o reading it.  Maybe the placer doesn't subscribe to any email carrier.  <br/>
After all letterboxing is not about computers.  It isn't about email.  It isn't <br/>
about talk list.  There are so many boxes these days, I think a little variety <br/>
in the findability is OK.  I also think that boxes should only be adopted <br/>
with the original placer's permission.  That's not to say that you can't offer a <br/>
little TLC.<br/>
