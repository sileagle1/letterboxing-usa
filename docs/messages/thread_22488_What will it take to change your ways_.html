At what point will the higher gas prices affect your letterboxing <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I filled the tank on the minivan yesterday.  The cheapest around that I<br/>
could find was $2.68 a gallon and the fill-up came to $52.00.  Not a<br/>
pleasant experience.<br/>
<br/>
I'm noticing a lot more people in this area pulling in and "filling up" when<br/>
they're down maybe 3 or 4 gallons or so.  It's like nobody trusts that the<br/>
price won't just another 20 cents before the hour is out, so might as well<br/>
slip into the station as long as they're going past it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it's definitely affected my boxing this summer.  The prices in the<br/>
spring weren't high enough yet for me to really feel it, but by summer they<br/>
were.<br/>
<br/>
I bicycle to work, so I save money that way and I bicycle around town to run<br/>
various errands -- library, meat market, etc.  But I've always done that my<br/>
entire life, nothing new there.<br/>
<br/>
With boxing, I'm not interested in carpooling because generally it's just<br/>
not convenient.  I usually can't match schedules well with other people.<br/>
But the price of gas has definitely cut down on how far I'll travel and how<br/>
many times I've been travelling.<br/>
<br/>
I used to take a week's vacation at a time and head someplace with a lot of<br/>
boxes, stay in a motel and snag some of the boxes in that area while doing<br/>
some sightseeing.  I'm audiovoyant, often I'm being "pulled" in one<br/>
direction or another for travel, so while I'm in that area I sightsee and<br/>
box.  This summer, the furthest I've gone so far is about 2 1/2 hours away<br/>
(from Chicago, IL to Freeport, IL), and that was only one trip, and only for<br/>
3 days.  I'm planning on taking another trip in mid-October.  That too, will<br/>
likely only be 3 hours away or so, and only for 3 days.  The family that<br/>
wants me to come and check out an old Civil War cemetery in the area will be<br/>
paying my motel expenses and my gas expenses between my house and their<br/>
town.  I don't expect them to pay any gas expense I incur from driving<br/>
around searching for boxes.  It'd be nice if they volunteered to but I don't<br/>
think that's gonna happen. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I've had folks call me, asking me to fly to their area, and in the past I'd<br/>
do that, have them pay the airfare and I'd pay for the rental car and gas<br/>
because I'd box and sightsee at the same time.  But it's just been too<br/>
expensive lately.<br/>
<br/>
So yep, I've pretty much been restricting myself to boxes that are much<br/>
closer to my home or just not boxing at all.  As a Postal worker, my<br/>
mortgage, utilities, and veterinary expenses take a big bite.  And the<br/>
forecast for natural gas heat doesn't look any too good for this winter from<br/>
what I understand.  Even tho I have a fairly energy efficient house, I'm<br/>
still putting money away for this winter's heating bills.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing, hiking, camping, etc. -- those are, unfortunately, *very*<br/>
unfortunately,  expendable-when-necessary activities.<br/>

<br/>
Besides not being the type to box alone all that often, other factors such as the heat and ozone, deerflies, and bumper crop of poison ivy in RI this year have kept me out of the woods. I've boxed very little. Dan has boxed even less.  When I have a real urge to go get a box alone, a nice easy or seems real safe type of box that's not too far away, I talk myself out of using the gas. I have an SUV and it uses up too much gas for unnecessary jaunts.  I need that gas and the money it costs for more necessary things. If I can combine a box with an errand, then we do.  Otherwise, out-of-state trips like Fear Faketor and Boxing by the Bay will be the bulk of our boxing this summer. That way, we get away together, see a new place, get to meet or reunite with boxers, and get a few boxes we would never just drive that far to get if there had been no gathering to lure us.  And a planned trip is the best way to get Dan out to box. His job and commute have been sucking the life out of him and he's very conscious of gas usage.  When we plan a trip, we plan on buying the gas for it, and it doesn't seem as frivolous as just driving around after boxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The exorbitant gas prices these past few years have DEFINITELY affected <br/>
our letterboxing outings.  I can't justify spending that kind of money <br/>
on fuel to get from points A to B along the way just to hunt tupperware <br/>
in the woods.  Many of our 'unlocated' boxes in the area are dozens of <br/>
miles away from home so any outing is usually quite expensive.  As an <br/>
attempt to limit our fuel expenses, I've resorted to squeezing in some <br/>
letterboxing hunts during previously 'planned' non-letterboxing trips.  <br/>
Yesterday, I saw gas prices on Whidbey Island, WA (about 20 miles from <br/>
Seattle as the crow flies) at $4 a gallon (they're hovering around <br/>
$2.75 a gallon in/around our neighborhood) so that's a big reason why <br/>
we've cut back substantially on our letterboxing pursuits this year.  :<br/>
(  We're pursuing some other 'financial' goals at the moment so once we <br/>
attain those then hopefully we'll dive back into letterboxing with the <br/>
same enthusiasm we experienced pre-gas price surge.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay maybe it is just because we returned from a two month <br/>
trailer/letterboxing trip and we have to justify gas prices in our <br/>
own minds, but you have to consider that gas prices are relative to <br/>
every other thing that is effected by inflation. Compare gas prices <br/>
in the 80s to home prices in the 80s. I used to get a cup of coffee <br/>
for 25 cents, and now you pay a whole lot more. We are spoiled by <br/>
the price of gas and Europe laughs at us when we complain about $3 <br/>
plus per gallon. Heck they don't even get it by the gallon, they buy <br/>
it by the liter and pay a heck of a lot more. We complain, but then <br/>
don't want any drilling for resources that might bother some <br/>
caribou. Some folks blame the car makers and building those SUVs,but <br/>
they wouldn't build them if they didn't sell. We might change our <br/>
ways but it won't be until gas gets a heck of a lot higher.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, when we were in Oregon hanging out on the coast it <br/>
seems like there was an expresso/coffee drive thru about every mile <br/>
or so. Do Oregonians drink THAT much expresso? Now at $4 or $5 per <br/>
cup that could take our truck almost 20 miles on unleaded regular at <br/>
$3 per gallon.<br/>

shelling out money for a theme park, or a movie, or some expensive <br/>
summer camp, or Chuck E Cheese's (god forbid), we are spending the <br/>
money on gas to find out fascinating details about the state we live <br/>
in, and take healthy hikes in the great outdoors.  We try to pinch <br/>
pennies by packing our own lunches but letterboxing is a nice hobby in <br/>
the low cost of accessories.  I am not thrilled about the cost of gas <br/>
but we try to combine trips to find a few boxes at the same time to <br/>
help out with that.  On balance, I think we have spent less this <br/>
summer than other ways to pass the time, and we certainly have spent <br/>
more time using our noggins and getting outside.<br/>

*****I guess we could always look at it this way: <br/>
Coffee is a WHOLE lot more than gas by the gallon!<br/>
<br/>
But then, if you squint with the other eye, you have<br/>
to remind yourself that it IS still possible to get a<br/>
bottomless cup of coffee (but not at Starbucks)...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Believe it or not, higher gas prices have actually<br/>
enhanced my letterboxing this summer.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, we live in a small town so we have to go<br/>
to the next town bigger to get things a couple of<br/>
times a week usually.  It used to be nothing to make a<br/>
flying trip to pick something up.  We've made<br/>
ourselves smarter about those trips, so we've saved<br/>
ourselves some drive time and some gas.<br/>
<br/>
Second, we've incorporated letterboxing and other<br/>
forms of entertainment into the necessary trips, so<br/>
the letterboxing has piggy-backed on necessity.  <br/>
<br/>
Thirdly, we've thought outside the box and looked at<br/>
other towns we could go to instead to get what we<br/>
need, and even though they are all a little further<br/>
away, the fact that we are combining work and play has<br/>
minimized the additional expense of the few extra<br/>
miles.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, we've changed our mindset - it used to be<br/>
work first, play last.  If the work got done, the play<br/>
could happen.  Now we think more along the lines of<br/>
how much can we pack into a trip to best justify the<br/>
gas.  Because we weren't as wise as we could've been<br/>
about our drive time, we often had less play time. <br/>
We've combined trips into one so we have much less<br/>
drive time, and we wound up with more play time in the<br/>
bargain.  <br/>
<br/>
It doesn't change the fact that gas is just too darned<br/>
expensive, but at least we haven't yet had to cut out<br/>
our entertainment.<br/>

There has GOT to be more to life than working and paying bills or really, what's the point? Like Don said, it would have to get a heck of a lot higher for me to change my ways. The only thing that keeps me from boxing is the summer heat and humidity. But September is right around the corner....Dude and I are ready.<br/>

I could not justify using gas to drive 30 miles from here to get boxes. It<br/>
just makes me mad. And after grocery shopping today I guess I'll give up<br/>
eating too!<br/>

better than watching TV or just sitting around eating all day when you are <br/>
