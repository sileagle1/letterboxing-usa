                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, regarding the Ants Go Marching series that we planted 9/29 in <br/>
Goodwin State Forest in Hampton, CT, we would like to change the way <br/>
to count the stamps.  We didn't take into account the fact that a <br/>
person could figure out where the last one is then sign in and get <br/>
the same amount of finds as someone who takes the time to search for <br/>
the complete series.  We were thinking that for some boxes, one has <br/>
to hike a complete trail before getting the one box at the end, which <br/>
is sort of what we were doing, except with nine other micro boxes to <br/>
find on the way.  We think it is a good idea to change the count from <br/>
one to ten, and hopefully with that, more people will go out and find <br/>
these guys. However, we will not be changing the placement or the <br/>
setup of the boxes.  The micro boxes just don't have any room for a <br/>
log book or a writing utensil, and if we included these, we would <br/>
have to rehind many of them, as some of the hiding spots are very <br/>
small. We are sorry for any discouragement or confusion this may have <br/>
caused.  Thanks to all for bringing this up.<br/>

&gt; I think that every box found should count as a find but they all <br/>
should have books in them as well as stamps. I saw that the planter <br/>
said to find the 10 boxes but count it as 1 find. I didn't care too <br/>
much for that idea and never bothered to get out to them even though <br/>
I am familier with the area. I would hope the planter makes <br/>
adjustments even if it means redoing the clues to make each box a <br/>
find. That's just my thinking on the subject and I mean no disrespect <br/>
to the planter or anyone who does not mind the original <br/>
idea.....Chuck and Molly<br/>

&gt; Glad to say that despite the wet weather, "Walking Weekend" in <br/>
&gt; CT was definitely not a complete wash-out for us this year! We <br/>
&gt; took in quite a few of the nature and history walks, slipped back <br/>
&gt; to RI briefly for the mystery gathering, and even managed to <br/>
&gt; squeeze in a bit of letterboxing between walks on Sunday and <br/>
&gt; Monday! The most fun walk of all, though, was probably taking <br/>
&gt; Pete on the trail of the "Ants Go Marching" yesterday in Hampton, <br/>
&gt; CT. I'd gone up there a few days earlier and was just charmed by <br/>
&gt; those cute little ant stamps! Now, Pete wants to count them as a <br/>
&gt; series of 10 (instead of just 1), since we did manage to find all <br/>
&gt; 10 ants, and it does seem sort of unfair that someone who might <br/>
&gt; find just 1 or 2 of the ants and then sign the logbook at the end <br/>
&gt; would get the same count (1) as someone who takes the time to <br/>
&gt; find more or all of them! I maintain that just getting the whole <br/>
&gt; stamp collection of the cute little fellows doing all those strange <br/>
&gt; little things is its own reward, but I would also be curious to <br/>
hear <br/>
&gt; other people's opinions. At any rate, don't miss checking out <br/>
&gt; those cool ants!  I also have to say I got the biggest charge <br/>
&gt; thinking about those revolutionary women baring arms for the <br/>
&gt; cause of freedom at Irishtinker's great new series in Coventry, <br/>
&gt; CT! We're certainly lucky to have so many talented carvers and <br/>
&gt; planters in our neck of the woods! Thanks again, guys!<br/>
