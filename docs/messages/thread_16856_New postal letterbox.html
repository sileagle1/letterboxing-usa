We'll send this letterbox on it's way in 2 weeks, Dec 1st, 2003.  One of the requirements of this postal box is that each person is to email me and let me know when it has arrived at each stop so we don't lose track of it. This is all that I ask.<br/>

We hope that you will enjoy this stamp and it's Treasure Box.<br/>
