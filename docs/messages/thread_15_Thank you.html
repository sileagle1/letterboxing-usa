<br/>
Thank you very much for your positive comments about the getting started<br/>
page.  Please direct your salutations to Erik for content.  I just<br/>
copied it onto the web.  I will take credit for the layout though.<br/>
<br/>
Getting Started afterthought:<br/>
I'm wondering if the very first item ought to be for the letterbox<br/>
searcher rather than the the letterbox creator.  I think we're kinda<br/>
focused on the creation of boxes right now because we are in the early<br/>
stages of the hobby and feel that we need to promote the creation of<br/>
boxes in order to keep the game going.  But certainly at some point we<br/>
will want to focus more on the searching aspect and perhaps then a<br/>
"search kit" description.<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank those of you who are creating boxes.  Its a lot more<br/>
involved to create a box than to just go find one.  I don't think its<br/>
less exciting though.<br/>
<br/>
Kid's Corner:<br/>
I saw at least one positive comment on the Kid's Corner idea.  I wonder<br/>
if it should be a separate site or page mnaybe.  I wonder if it should<br/>
be separate to discourage kids from wandering into some of the clues on<br/>
this page that may take you into remote and/or hazardous places.  Or<br/>
would it be good to just put a note on the clue like "Good for Kids." <br/>
Perhaps the kids corner could represent special instructions geared for<br/>
kids and then point them only to the "Good for Kids" clues???  I'm just<br/>
thinking out loud.<br/>

Now a question how many of you homeschool? I think this is a great idea for us. We homeschool,and we like to hike often,and to younger children just going for going is tedious.But I think that if they know the will be something cool like a stamp for their very own book it will make all the more desireious to go!<br/>
<br/>
So do family have family stamp or do each of your children have there verey own hand made stamp? I am so into this.... <br/>

enough that we can fit everyone's stamp plus a little handwritten <br/>
note on one logbook page (so we don't hog up the logbook with one <br/>
stamp per page).  We also have a family mini-stamp that we use for <br/>
microboxes, just one little stamp to represent all of us.<br/>
<br/>
We started out with separate logbooks but quickly found it to be too <br/>
much of a pain.  It can be difficult enough stamping in discretely <br/>
without trying to juggle multiple books on the trail.  All kids <br/>
agreed that we would just keep one for the entire family and no one <br/>
has a problem with that (amazing...)<br/>
<br/>
I think this would be great for homeschooling!  It gets you out to so <br/>
many cool sites, and you learn so much incidental information along <br/>
the way (especially when trying to figure out mystery boxes).  Have <br/>
fun!<br/>

just so excited to get their book stamped they weren't thinking about <br/>
their bodys.  My four year old is usually stamped with something at <br/>
all times.  <br/>
We all have our own stamps and books and it is near impossible to be <br/>
discrete.  However with 5 people it really wouldn't matter because <br/>
there is always a crowd.  :-)    We do have a family stamp, but <br/>
haven't used it yet.   <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We homeschool!  We learned about letterboxing on an email homeschool<br/>
group.  Someone just casually mentioned it as their family hobby and I<br/>
checked it out and we ran with it as a family.  We have always been<br/>
day-trippers looking for interesting things to do and see, so<br/>
letterboxing was a perfect fit for us.  This spring we took our first<br/>
letterboxing-camping vacation and had lots of fun; saw lots of<br/>
interesting things.  One of our first few letterbox finds took us on a<br/>
very unexpected adventure.<br/>
<br/>
We were looking for Pioneer Village near Saukville, WI.  Upon entering<br/>
the park, we realized that the weekend we happened to search for that<br/>
box there was a Revolutionary War re-enactment taking place.  While the<br/>
main part of the Pioneer Village was closed to visitors after a certain<br/>
hour, the rest of the park was not.  We drove on past the encampment and<br/>
followed the gravel road to find the trail we were looking for.  As we<br/>
drove along the gravel road, we came upon a company of Redcoats marching<br/>
down the road!  What do we do?!  We held back in the van a bit as the<br/>
soldiers marched on.  They ignored us!  As we hung back and inched<br/>
along, they eventually marched off into a clearing and we drove on.<br/>
Finding the trail, we parked and headed off on our search.  The box was<br/>
easy to find, but the hike seemed all too short, so we decided to hike<br/>
further on.  To our further surprise, we came upon a man dressed in<br/>
minuteman clothing.  He greeted us cordially, asked if we were well and<br/>
if we had seen any Redcoats in the area.  I tried to joke, suggesting<br/>
maybe we shouldn't be there at that time, to which he responded that he<br/>
didn't understand why we would think that.  The thing was that he wasn't<br/>
going to break character and acknowledge we were not in the 1700's.  We<br/>
caught on and we told him about the Redcoats on the road.  He thanked<br/>
us, told us to stay safe and moved quietly on toward the road.  By this<br/>
time the kids were a tad spooked, but we hiked a bit further and then<br/>
started to hear men shouting and gunfire in the distance.  The kids were<br/>
really getting spooked and it was becoming too real for them.<br/>
<br/>
We decided to turn back, but back on the road the Redcoats were swarming<br/>
all over the place.  We stayed back until they cleared out and then made<br/>
a beeline to the van.  As we drove out of the park, we saw one farm boy<br/>
captured and set down in a field with a guard and then two unsuspecting<br/>
farm women walking in that direction.  Who knows what happened to them?!<br/>
<br/>
You should have heard the conversation in our van all the way home!  We<br/>
all have very fond memories of that letterboxing adventure!  I can't<br/>
tell you how many cool things we have seen or done because of<br/>
letterboxing.<br/>

&gt;  Ok after I posted I went a searched all the link,databases,and<br/>
&gt; files... I have some understanding now.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now a question how many of you homeschool? I think this is a great<br/>
&gt; idea for us. We homeschool,and we like to hike often,and to younger<br/>
&gt; children just going for going is tedious.But I think that if they know<br/>
&gt; the will be something cool like a stamp for their very own book it<br/>
&gt; will make all the more desireious to go!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So do family have family stamp or do each of your children have there<br/>
&gt; verey own hand made stamp? I am so into this....<br/>
