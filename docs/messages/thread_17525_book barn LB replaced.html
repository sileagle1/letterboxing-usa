missing, thank you.  Today I finally was able to replace it.  I carved the same <br/>
image but it is in a new place.  These are the clues that I posted on the LBNA <br/>
website.<br/>
<br/>
As you enter the grounds of Book Barn go up the stairs on your left into the <br/>
main building. Enter the building, head up the stairs, watch out for sleeping <br/>
dogs and cats.  At the top of the stairs look right toward the children's <br/>
section.  Notice the corner in front of you.  Reach up at the top of it to find <br/>
the newly carved book barn letterbox.  (It is the same design as the one that <br/>
went missing but in a new location)<br/>
