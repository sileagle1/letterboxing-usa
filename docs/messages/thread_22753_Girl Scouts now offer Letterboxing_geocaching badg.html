Hmm. Some folks may argue with that text. Maybe the website editor <br/>

<br/>
I was introduced to Letterboxing at a  Girl Scouts leader training weekend<br/>
this Fall.  The Spar and Spindle council (which covers Merrimack Valley and<br/>
North Shore of Massachusetts) is aware of letterboxing and beginning to<br/>
promote it within it's council.  I have found through this group and the<br/>
girl scout groups that there are some of us who are  girl<br/>
scouts/letterboxers.  It is a great way to get our girls hiking and to teach<br/>
them about problem solving.  I will be working on letterboxing with my troop<br/>
this year.  I have a troop of 8 + 9 year old girls.<br/>

Hello all from a new (so new we've not actually done it yet)<br/>
letterboxer and leader of a Cadette troop. The badge mentioned above<br/>
is what got me interested and we have found one listed that is only<br/>
about 20 minutes from us that I'll use to introduce the girls to. I'm<br/>
always looking for new things to get my 8th graders out of the house<br/>
and away from their cell phones, gameboys, tvs, and ipods and I hope<br/>
this goes over well!<br/>
<br/>
I'll be searching the archives for a while to ensure I don't ask<br/>
questions that have been asked dozens of times and I hope our first<br/>
search is as fun as it sounds.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to letterboxing, Elaine.  You would probably do well to poke<br/>
about the archives of the "new boxers" yahoogroup.  Here is a link:<br/>

Newboxers group is the place to ask ANY of those 'newbie' questions<br/>
without fear of being thought of as an annoyance.<br/>
<br/>
Also.. I wanted to thank you for your responsible attitude with regard<br/>
to finding out more info before you begin.  It's really important that<br/>
you understand some of the guidelines for this activity ... to help<br/>
preserve not only the hiding place of the letterboxes, but to<br/>
appreciate the effort it took to place and maintain boxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As a former Girl Scout leader and Cub scout den<br/>
mother, a few words of caution when boxing with<br/>
scouts. You might want to find the box you speak of on<br/>
your own first. Being discrete is part of boxing and<br/>
somtimes kids don't  get that. I do think 8th graders<br/>
just might. I also wounldn't take more than 4 or 5<br/>
girls at a time, stamping in with a group can be<br/>
chaotic. One stamp for the troop might be an idea. <br/>
Before you turn them lose on a box you might want to<br/>
plant one just for them to find for practice. When you<br/>
create your own box you find the care you take in<br/>
preparing the box makes you more repectful of the time<br/>
and care taken by others when they plant. Letterboxing<br/>
is a great activity for scouts when done with care.<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
************I would like to second this idea - and<br/>
tell you how I'm handling it.<br/>
<br/>
There have been several discussions over the last<br/>
couple years about scouts who letterbox in numbers. <br/>
Sometimes boxers get frustrated by problems with<br/>
scouts failing to replace properly or taking up the<br/>
whole logbook or leaving litter about or leaving a<br/>
telltale trail to the box.  Personally, I think these<br/>
problems reflect more on leaders than on the scouts,<br/>
who take their cue from their leaders.  Elaine, since<br/>
you are being diligent in doing your homework in<br/>
advance, I doubt seriously you will fall into that<br/>
category and you can be instrumental in creating<br/>
goodwill between scouts and letterboxers by teaching<br/>
your scouts to be responsible and respectful with the<br/>
creations of others.<br/>
<br/>
As a Cub Scout leader myself and a letterboxer, I've<br/>
always hated to read those threads about other boxers'<br/>
bad experiences with scout groups.  I've also had a<br/>
fair number of scout leaders in my local area express<br/>
interest in letterboxing.  I think letterboxing has a<br/>
lot to offer scouts and vice versa, but I think it's<br/>
important that scouts get the right framework before<br/>
they ever hit a box in the wild, so I'm in the process<br/>
of planting a "Scout Training Series" in a park near<br/>
me.  I've got the stamps carved and the boxes made and<br/>
I plan to plant them next week while I'm off work. <br/>
I'm going to test the series with my Webelos den next<br/>
month before I open it up to other scout groups.  In<br/>
preparation we just carved personal stamps as part of<br/>
our Artist activity pin to help them understand some<br/>
of the work that goes into a box.  <br/>
<br/>
The box stamps are simple versions of six Cub Scout<br/>
icons and the boxes will be planted with compass<br/>
readings and paces and visual landmarks, and will be<br/>
Leave No Trace-friendly.  The clue pages will also<br/>
emphasize to observe good letterboxing practices by<br/>
giving them specifics on how to replant and leave<br/>
hiding places undetectible.  Hopefully by the time<br/>
they finish the series, they will be capable of<br/>
exploring other boxes and representing the scouting<br/>
community proudly to letterboxers whose boxes they<br/>
find.<br/>
<br/>
All of this to say, I really think it's a good idea<br/>
for you to try planting a box of your own.  Aside from<br/>
it giving you an idea of the sense of pride in<br/>
creation that letterboxers feel about their boxes, you<br/>
can exert some control over your group's first boxing<br/>
experience by providing clues that will give them a<br/>
wide range of outdoor skills in searching and will<br/>
demonstrate good scout principles like LNT.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck in your first endeavors and I hope your<br/>
girls get hooked on letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My own experience -- letterboxing has been popular with Connecticut <br/>
Trails Council girls since 2000 (thanks to Annie B) -- kids get caught <br/>
up in the excitement and they tend not clean up or re-hide boxes well. <br/>
Excitement breeds excitement, and larger groups of girls can get very <br/>
enthusiastic, but smaller groups do this too.  I have followed troops <br/>
on trails to find they have left the box were they were stamping, not <br/>
remembering even to put it back in its hiding spot, or recovering it <br/>
so poorly it may as well not be.<br/>
<br/>
An experienced adult MUST fall back from the group and tidy up and <br/>
make sure the box is properly covered (no peeking corners!!!) after a <br/>
troop has done their thing.  It is best to appoint a "sweeper" for <br/>
this so responsibilities are clear. Leaders can forget or not notice <br/>
when their primary concern is accounting for all the scouts.<br/>
