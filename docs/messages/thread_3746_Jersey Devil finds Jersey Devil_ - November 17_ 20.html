<p><b>... </b>and what a find it 
was, being the first to stamp in.<span>  
</span>Our group has been researching this box since it was placed back in 
February 2001, choosing this box as our first.<span>  </span>We searched the area three times 
throughout the year, but needed to defer from the search from time to time, 
locating other boxes, so not to lose our enthusiasm with 
letterboxing.</p>
<p> We all sat around the box, 
in what you may call a slight depression.<span>  
</span>Researching the box was a long and very enjoyable venture, and now 
knowing the search was complete, we felt we were losing a long time 
friend.</p>
<p> We are now off and running 
to Randy Hall’s next two NJ boxes, Time Traveler and Calico.<span>  </span>We hope these boxes are just as 
rewarding as the first, and since they are rated more difficult, I’m sure we 
will again be using a lot of expletive words towards Randy as we begin our 
research for the boxes.</p>
<p>Thanks to all you New Jersey folks 
who are broadening the letterbox list.<span>  
</span>We look forward to finding the boxes throughout the coming years, and 
hope to place some boxes ourselves.</p>
