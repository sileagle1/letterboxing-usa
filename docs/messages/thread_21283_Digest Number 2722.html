                    <div class="plaintext-content">Back in 2001 I did a cross Geo/Letterbox.  I placed 11 total boxes. The <br/>
first 10 boxes had anywhere between 4-6 word stamps. You printed out a sheet <br/>
with numbers on it and went on your way. Each box had GPS waypoint and <br/>
Letterbox Clues. Each stamp in each box had numbers on the back. You stamped <br/>
that stamp on each number on the sheet you printed out. When you found all <br/>
10 boxes the sheet was a letterbox clue to get the 11th box or (cache with <br/>
goodies)<br/>
<br/>
At the end of 2003 I had 103 Geocachers and 86 Letterboxers do the 11 boxes.<br/>
<br/>
You are right Jay in the fact that Geocaching is getting so hard to get <br/>
something<br/>
approved because of the type of approver's they recrute. Here in  Cincinnati <br/>
they<br/>
got Web-ling from the OKIC group to be an approver. He's from the smaller of <br/>
the<br/>
two groups we have here in Cincinnati and the president of OKIC. There was <br/>
an article<br/>
from the Cincinnati post talking about how OKIC helped get the permits in <br/>
the Hamilton County<br/>
park System. Members of CACHE Club have worked hard over the years as we <br/>
have many<br/>
letterbox members that were around way before Geocaching started. We worked <br/>
hard to<br/>
keep the permits out of the parks and they were because Letterboxers showed <br/>
they could<br/>
be trusted.  All of that trust changed in a two week spain last year by the <br/>
OKIC officers.<br/>
<br/>
Geocaching.com made Web-ling and Approver even thought most people here in <br/>
Cincinnati<br/>
are very upset about the permits.Then again that has been Geocaching's thing <br/>
to do. Even thought<br/>
Letterboxing was in the parks first, They think they are doing the right <br/>
thing when in fact<br/>
we all have seen what's going on and it't not fun.<br/>
<br/>
I will say that I am a big time Geocacher as well as a Big time Letterboxer. <br/>
I love to do both!<br/>
as my real hobby is just being out of the house and hiking. So one hobby <br/>
feeds another hobby<br/>
and the best thing I  got from all the hobby's is all the friends I have <br/>
collected from all of them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway the real question is what do you do about this problem?  Fist of all, <br/>
I do want to<br/>
point out that YES! I know this is a letterbox board and you haveto think of <br/>
the letterboxing<br/>
hobby as a part of the Circle of life. What Geocaching does WILL affect <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, By the way, Here is the Article I was talking about that was in the <br/>
Cincinnati Post just<br/>
so you can read it for yourself.<br/>

Subject: Re: Geocache cross addiction<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I am wondering how many of us are cross addicted to geocaching?<br/>
<br/>
We've done a couple, and it was really fun, but it didn't "take." I<br/>
think the reason for us is that the thing is so regulated, so<br/>
actively managed. Maybe they have to do that since it's so BIG, but I<br/>
think it's more to do with them being commercial. The managers (can't<br/>
think of the name they use, maybe "facilitators?") have to approve<br/>
your clues and will edit them before allowing them on the website.<br/>
They will also delete your clues, even if you ask them not to. At<br/>
letterboxing.org, a crucial (and often overlooked) difference is that<br/>
you maintain the creative rights to your letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Still, come April 1st, we hope to do some more boxcaching! ;)<br/>

Doc, good to hear from you! I remember those days and your Sith <br/>
Impossible jaunt. That one was incredible...seems so long ago. Glad <br/>
to know you're still addicted. Mark should talk to you in one of <br/>
his "interviews." Jay in CT<br/>
