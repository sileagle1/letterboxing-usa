	Your Quahog Hitchhiker is currently in the possession of S.Pike and<br/>
Frogger in CT.  We picked it up at the "Duality of Nature" letterbox at<br/>
the Fall Gathering in RI.  Unfortuanetly, we have not been very active<br/>
on the trails lately and have yet to find a new home for it.  We'll try<br/>
to let you know when it goes back into circulation but not where.<br/>

I just wanted to know if the little mollusk was alive and had been spotted,<br/>
and now I know he's in good hands.  I also, regretably, have a HH that needs<br/>
to be placed but my partner is back to work now and hasn't felt like<br/>
'boxing.  I may just go on my own one day after the snow and squishy soil is<br/>
gone and send him off rather than keep any longer.<br/>
<br/>

~thinking of a non-woodsy spot to send this HH off...<br/>

just read you need someone to go with and I know the feeling. I am<br/>
retired and am really into this hobby and have 'tired' out most of my<br/>
friends. Would love to meet up with you if you are in driving range!!<br/>
Where are you ?  I am in Ct.<br/>

Connecticut is a 'boxing goldmine, from what I can see!  Betz and I only<br/>
ventured across the state line once.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Warwick, RI, not far from T.F. Green airport (erroneously called<br/>
the Providence airport).  Want to talk about this in private email?  Betz<br/>
might even be dragged across the state line. :-)<br/>
