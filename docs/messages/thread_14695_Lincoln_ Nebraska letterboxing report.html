                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today my daughter, Emily, and I went to the Prairie Peace Park to<br/>
check up on our two letterboxes and one geocache.  All was found well<br/>
and dry.  We enjoyed looking at the stamps of visitors.<br/>
<br/>
We then went to Lincon and sought:<br/>
<br/>
1. Journey of the Saints #1<br/>
2. Son of Cornhusker<br/>
3. Beetle Box<br/>
<br/>
"Journey of the Saints 1" was found in good order.  The wording about<br/>
which sidewalk to take regarding picnic tables, etc, was a little hard<br/>
to follow, but once we got on track, we had no problem at all finding<br/>
the box.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't research well enough to get a good map for "Son of<br/>
Cornhusker".  I ended up going to a park near Antelope Circle and none<br/>
of the clues matched up.  I will have to try this one again at a later<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't find "Beetle Box" where I though it should go.  I loved the<br/>
"swinging" clue, but was unable to find the box under the tree.  The<br/>
park seemed to be a very busy spot, with kids entering near a<br/>
makeshift entrance near what I assumed to be the box's resting place.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm glad to see letterboxing is gaining some ground in Nebraska, and<br/>
we hope to get back to Lincoln soon to find the rest of them.  I also<br/>
have my eye out for more Omaha hiding spots.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
