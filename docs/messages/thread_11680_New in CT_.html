HOPE<br/>
Planted by Butterfly<br/>
April 2 , 2003<br/>
Quinnipiac Linear Trail<br/>
Wallingford, CT. New Haven County<br/>
<br/>
HOPE<br/>
Hope Springs Eternal<br/>
Hope you have a nice day.<br/>
Hope it doesnt  rain  / snow !!<br/>
Hope you come again .<br/>
<br/>
Hope comes from Feelings  big and small, and from everyone. So~~~<br/>
I hope you enjoy finding this letterbox and<br/>
I hope you like the stamp I carved  and<br/>
I hope it brings you nice feelings  and<br/>
I hope you walk the labyrinth.!! Enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Clues. While here, check out  Double Happiness  and  Light the Way<br/>
letterboxes on<br/>
this same trail.<br/>
The walk begins at the far end of the parking lot and is a paved path<br/>
enjoyed by bikers<br/>
and walkers.  Stop soon at a clearing on the right side of the trail.<br/>
Here are benches to sit<br/>
and a Labyrinth  to ponder. Information about the Labyrinth is printed<br/>
there for you to<br/>
read.  From the center of the Labyrinth take a reading of 80 degrees.<br/>
Notice a small pile<br/>
of soil with a chunk of cement from an old wall. A large piece of quartz<br/>
sits on the top.<br/>
Still standing in the center ,  left of the quartz at 60 degrees is a<br/>
tree of many trunks. The<br/>
HOPE letterbox is waiting there under some stones.  Please honor other<br/>
folks if they are<br/>
walking the Labyrinth for it might be a spiritual journey for them.<br/>
When you are alone,<br/>
stamp in and please replace and cover well with the stones.<br/>
I hope you have had a pleasant time.<br/>
