San Diego, CA<br/>
Planted 11/30/02<br/>
Difficulty: Easy<br/>
Distance: 1/2 mile<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Lake Murray is in Mission Trails Regional Park, one of the <br/>
largest urban parks in the country.  This box is located at the <br/>
northeast end of the lake.  Enter the park at the intersection of <br/>
Murray Lake Drive and Belle Glade Avenue.  Follow the one-way <br/>
driveway to the lake.  As you enter the parking lot there will be a <br/>
softball field on your right.  Park as close to this field as <br/>
possible and walk along the driveway towards the lake.<br/>
        As it turns into the bike path you will pass several <br/>
informational signs and a large blue-grey restroom on your right.  <br/>
Continue along the paved path as it loops around the corner of the <br/>
lake.  As you start travelling along the opposite shore you will see <br/>
a sign identifying Del Cerro Bay.  If you bring some bread along you <br/>
can take a break here and feed the ducks.  <br/>
        At the second telephone pole past the sign.  To find the box, <br/>
look under the rock next to the south side of the pole.  This is an <br/>
easy hike for children or strollers.<br/>

DESCANSO GARDENS SERIES (3 BOXES)<br/>
Los Angeles County<br/>
Near La Canada, CA<br/>
Planted 12/1/02<br/>
Difficulty: Easy<br/>
Distance: About 1 mile for all three<br/>
General Info: #1 and #2 are easy for children and strollers, for #3 <br/>
very young children might need to be in a backpack.  Admission to the <br/>
garden is $5 for adults, less for others.  Directions and info can be <br/>
found at www.descanso.com.  The gardens can be quite busy on <br/>
weekends, so you might need to be careful in your searching.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#1: FEATHER FALLS<br/>
        For all of the boxes, getting a map at the entrance will be <br/>
helpful.  When entering the gardens, go to the right.  Continue past <br/>
the very old clock (check the map if you're having problems finding <br/>
it) to the first trail on your left.  Follow this trail.  After <br/>
crossing the bridge, stop at the wishing well.<br/>
        Facing the wishing well, take the trail that branches off at <br/>
an angle of 200 degrees.  Just before the first of the two Feather <br/>
Falls, turn right and go behind the rocks of the waterfal.  Look <br/>
straight ahead for a large clump of tall grass.  The box is hidden in <br/>
the west end of the clump.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#2: CAMELLIA FOREST<br/>
        Winter and very early spring are the best times to look for <br/>
this box, as the Garden's many camellias will be in bloom.  Head <br/>
toward the west end of the main lawn (near the Garden's entrance) <br/>
until you find the Camellia Information Center.  Facing the sign, <br/>
take the trail to the left of the Information Center.  At the first <br/>
fork go right.  Just past the enclosed seating area on your left, <br/>
turn left at the fork.  You will immediately see a wooden bench.  <br/>
Stop and sit so that you are facing the diagonal tree.<br/>
        Get up and go six paces at 300 degrees to the large, angled <br/>
tree stump.  Go around the stump and look at its base (near the <br/>
irrigation pipe) for the box.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#3: CHAPARRAL NATURE TRAIL<br/>
        From the main entrance follow the path to your left, passing <br/>
the main lawn on your right and the Japanese Tea House and Japanese <br/>
Garden on your left.  At the four-way intersection, turn right.<br/>
        Just past the bridge over Fern Canyon, turn right and follow <br/>
this trail a short distance uphill until you come to the Chaparral <br/>
Nature Trail Trailhead.  Follow this trail uphill.  Along the way you <br/>
will see several signs identifying common California mountain flora, <br/>
and when you reach the top of the hill you will have an excellent <br/>
view of the western San Gabriel valley.  <br/>
        Continue along the trail, and just after sign 13 you will <br/>
enter a plateau of wild sage.  Turn right as you enter the sage and <br/>
sit at the wood bench.  Follow the path directly in front of you17 <br/>
paces to a small circle of rocks set in the ground.  Turn left and go <br/>
down a slight hill to where two pieces of lumper are lying on the <br/>
ground.  The letterbox is concealed where the two pieces of wood <br/>
intersect.<br/>
        After finding the box you can easily take any of the paths <br/>
down to the main paths of the Gardens.<br/>
