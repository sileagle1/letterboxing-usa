                    <div class="plaintext-content">DVN2r CKR rest assured that the THREE HH's I found on Sunday have <br/>
been transported out of the park and will be placed with careful <br/>
consideration in Western Washington.<br/>
<br/>
Amanda took my Busy as a Bee HH and who knows where she will land it.<br/>
<br/>
Rest assured Head Nail that the Math Box is alive and well.  The <br/>
prank pulled by Amanda / Ryan was all in good fun but had all of us <br/>
pace counting and returning up and down the trail.  Some going up <br/>
while the others going down made it sort of a Keystone Kop routine.  <br/>
Some concerned about their knowledge of leap years ( ahem) SOME <br/>
concerned with the clue writer not making proper use of Math symbols  <br/>
<br/>
( :-P  ).  <br/>
<br/>
I thought what a tough blow for a kid to have his box go missing.  <br/>
But no, safe and sound in its home.<br/>
<br/>
And Ryan, on my image of your fab map the Arrow looked more like a <br/>
Burning Bush.  We were slogging and prodding around in every scrap of <br/>
shrubbery, I don't think any of us paused to think that we should <br/>
look at other options.<br/>
<br/>
By Golly we were going to Make It Work!<br/>
<br/>
I'm still smiling!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, everyone!  After finding all of the new boxes at that park, I <br/>
still feel like I have barely scratched the surface there!!!  I have <br/>
a few more ideas for boxes up my sleeves.  Perhaps I should wait for <br/>
the 2nd annual S. Sound LB Quest Fest???  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Before then, however, I will sleep!  ;)  But, if you drop any hints <br/>
about hitchhikers in the great Pac NW maybe I'll awake from my deep <br/>
slumber for a tad...  ROTB(ed)L  :)  Or, if you post any sightings <br/>
about Waughops in the area.  I'd love to see one of those with my <br/>
own two eyes!!!  Are they friendly if you find them in the wild?<br/>
<br/>
***Warning slightly off topic here:  Oh, BTW--who brought that <br/>
scrumptious sandwich to the big event?  The one with the luncheon <br/>
meet, pesto (I think) &amp; roasted red peppers!  It was incredible and <br/>
I'd love to have the recipe, hint, hint so I can re-crEATe it at <br/>
home!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for everybody's help in making Sat such a successful <br/>
event!  Your stamps were all incredible works of art and your clues <br/>
exciting and refreshing.  It truly was a great adventure!!!  Can't <br/>
wait to see you all during other LB events in the future!!!<br/>
<br/>
God Bless,<br/>
