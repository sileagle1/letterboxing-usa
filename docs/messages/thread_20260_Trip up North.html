                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just back recently from  another trip up to northern New England <br/>
with another whole bunch of stamps to show for my letterboxing <br/>
efforts! I know, I'd said earlier that once I reached F5000 I'd try <br/>
to cut back and only do those hikes and climbs that really appealed <br/>
to me, but with all the boxes cropping up along the way nowadays, <br/>
what's a gal to do? Too hard not to stop as I'm driving by, right? <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I passed the F100 mark for both Vermont and New Hampshire a <br/>
while back, but picked up a few more boxes this trip with a day in <br/>
the Northeast Kingdom, a day in the Whites, and a weekend with Pete <br/>
on Mount Monadnock, recreating one of our earliest dates! Then I <br/>
headed back north to plant a couple of the Dawnlanders' "CT Symbols" <br/>
boxes in an area that I'd been wanting to get to for the longest <br/>
time. It was well worth the trip, and at the time there probably <br/>
wasn't another letterbox around for 100 miles using paved roads, <br/>
although there may now be some closer if you go as the crow flies! <br/>
<br/>
After a quick drive through Canada, I headed back to Maine for the <br/>
National Folk Festival in Bangor. What fun! - 3 days of music to <br/>
which I did authentic Gypsy, Romanian, Hungarian, African, Armenian, <br/>
and other types of dancing, and nearly passed out in the 90* heat! <br/>
<br/>
Rain cooled things off by the end of the weekend, so I took one day <br/>
to do the drive-ups in Aroostook County, one day for the Katahdin <br/>
area, one day for MDI, and one day for the Midcoast on my way home. <br/>
I ended up with a grand total of 349 boxes for Maine, which has now <br/>
ousted Ohio from 4th position in our personal state-by-state counts! <br/>
(And that certainly doesn't include any WOM's either, because the <br/>
only WOM's WE've ever gotten were for a couple of series in CT!!) <br/>
Who would have guessed there were so many boxes up in Maine? It <br/>
really is a treasure trove if you just get out there and search! I <br/>
couldn't possibly list all the boxes I found without annoying <br/>
someone, I'm sure, so I'll just name a few of my favorites for this <br/>
trip:  Mepanj's "Muhammad Ali Series" for one of the best <br/>
collections of mushrooms that I've ever seen in a small area - <br/>
especially between boxes 2 and 3; Ben and Lora's "Great Pond <br/>
Mountain" for a nice climb; Hockamock's "Brady Gang" for a bit more <br/>
adventure than I had originally anticipated; Amymisha's "Mr/Ms <br/>
Potato Head for pure whimsy; and the big surprise, "Just Opus" for <br/>
just cracking me up! Wonderful job up there, all you planters both <br/>
old and new! Thanks for a terrific vacation!<br/>
