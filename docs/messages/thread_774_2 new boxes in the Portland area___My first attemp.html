send them to Mitch soon to be added, along twith the clues.  These are the<br/>
first clues that I've written, and are not all all poetic or epic, but I<br/>
think they'll do the trick!<br/>

First two in the Oxbow Series:<br/>
<br/>
Take I-84 east to Troutdale exit 17.  Go past the truck stops until the<br/>
light.  Turn right onto 257th and go 3.5 miles to Division St.  Turn left<br/>
onto Division.  Follow the signs for 8 miles and then turn left, downhill<br/>
into the park.  Entrance fee is $3.00 per vehicle, and there are maps of the<br/>
parks available there.  Happy Hunting!<br/>
<br/>
#1 Find the Ampitheatre and take the trail to the left of it, towards the<br/>
river.  Head down the wooden steps. Now, proceed ahead with a bearing of 320<br/>
degrees.  Turn right at the trail closest to the river.  When you find<br/>
yourself betwixt the M&amp;M, head 9 paces (or slightly less if you are way<br/>
taller than 5') at 170 degrees. Now you should be directly in front of your<br/>
prize!  <br/>
<br/>
#2 Take the D trail, to the right of the road. Head to the right, and stay<br/>
to the right past the Woody Woodpecker home, and past the hollow tree.  At<br/>
the longest downed tree on the left, there is a sharp turn in the trail,<br/>
with a wood and rope railing.  If you suddenly find yourself able to  sit<br/>
down to a picnic, you've gone astray, instead, you should have leaned to the<br/>
left (it's the only way!). Now, there is a post in the ground near the turn<br/>
in the trail, from there head forward 19 paces. Look all around you and<br/>
enjoy the greenery, but what you seek is at 180 degrees...It may be easier<br/>
to find me if you can get down on your knees.   <br/>
