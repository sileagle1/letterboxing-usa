Thanks for all of your work. We are enjoying our new hobby, and have <br/>
been out many times this winter looking for boxes. We always wonder <br/>
what people might think seeing two adults digging around in the woods <br/>
in the snow in 15 degree weather!!.  We also disguise our tracks -no <br/>
fear! Tommorow I will go out with some hiking friends to introduce <br/>
them to letterboxing. I noticed that our "Tolland, Penquin Puzzle" <br/>
was not listed (Tolland was not listed). I hope that you get to try <br/>
it out during your upcoming get-together. The hand carved stamp is <br/>
quite nice.<br/>
