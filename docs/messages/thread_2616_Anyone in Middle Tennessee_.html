<br/>
Because there are more geocaches in my area and my husband and kids enjoy <br/>
them , We have been visiting geocaches around our area and leaving stamps in <br/>
the cache with notes that they are for letterboxers to stamp up with.  <br/>
Several times we have drummed up interest in letterboxing that way and have <br/>
had a few geocachers start planting letterboxes.<br/>

<div>Welcome 
Darrin...    A bit scarce in TN, but remember..... If YOU hide 
it, they will come. </div>
<div> I marvel at the 
past year and how far VA has come from maybe 1 active LBer (she was in MD I 
think) to now 3-4 and the box count from single digits to 57 now. It was a bit 
frustrating at first having to travel 1-2 hours to the nearest boxes, but it was 
worth it. </div>
<div>Hang in there and have fun.

If you make it over to the Smokey Mountains park, please let me know <br/>
if my boxes are still there and the condition of them. I had planned <br/>
to go back this spring but likely won't make it until November.<br/>

 What is a geocache?<br/>
  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<a href="http://www.geocaching.com/">Geocaching - The Official GPS Cache <br/>
Hunt Site</a><br/>
<br/>
It is similar to  letterboxing only the clues are usually the coordinates <br/>
with a few encrpted hints AND the box usually has a cache in it.  Leave <br/>
something ... take something.  A treasure hunt I guess but you need a hand <br/>
held GPS to find the coordinates.  We have been making letterbox geocaches <br/>
with clues, a stamp and coordinates.<br/>
