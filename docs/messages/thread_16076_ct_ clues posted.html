Sorry: overlapping emails. We should get out from in front of these <br/>
screens and enjoy this glorious day! To answer your question, the <br/>
clue part of the listing was blank. You know I love ya, so I hate to <br/>
say it, but it was probably "inexplicable pilot error." Anyway, the <br/>
clues were still in this archive so I pasted them in for you at LbNA. <br/>
Might I suggest that when you post new clues to the letterboxing.org <br/>
site you click the "announce" box so that your clues are safely <br/>
backed up in that other yahoogroup? I still like to post new box <br/>
clues here as well, although I know that's redundant. Just seems like <br/>
the central Gathering here. xoxox<br/>
