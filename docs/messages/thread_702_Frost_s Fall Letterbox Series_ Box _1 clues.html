Placed:  October 16, 1999<br/>
Box Owner/Author:  Nisa &amp; Eric Simila<br/>
Location:  path by Noone Falls, Peterborough, NH<br/>
Parking:  any available spot at Noone Falls<br/>
Clue Difficulty:  moderate<br/>
Terrian Difficulty:  easy (accessible by foot, bike, wheelchair,<br/>
stroller, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
In the days of old, steel iron giants travelled to and fro<br/>
But by foot is how you'll find this first letterbox<br/>
Walk 500 paces mean, more if you're hampered by snow,<br/>
Turn to the right and find your prize under the rocks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------<br/>
The stamp doesn't mention the area, but for the stamps of the future<br/>
boxes in the series, I'll remember to put that info on.  If you plan on<br/>
looking up this letterbox, I'd recommend you go in what's left of<br/>
October, just to get the full effect of it.  :)  You can go anytime of<br/>
year, though, because the trail is open year-round, I believe.  If you<br/>
go in the winter, you'll have to dig through the snow, however.  <br/>
<br/>
Tom, please put this up on the letterboxing clues page!<br/>
<br/>
This will be my last letterbox this year placed or found, but I'll be<br/>
working on more during the winter.  I won't be able to participate in<br/>
the November get-together due to personal reasons (so mysterious!), but<br/>
hopefully in the summer I'll be able to finish this series.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

Congrats on your new box. I've posted it on the same clue page as the <br/>
Shileing Forest boxes. Can you look at the map at the top of the page <br/>
and tell me where I should locate the Noone Falls red dot? Thanks.<br/>

P.S. Sorry you won't be able to make the gathering!<br/>
