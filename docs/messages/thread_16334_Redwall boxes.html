&gt; Magiz the Crow, the eleventh box in the Redwall series was planted on <br/>
&gt; Thursday, and this morning<br/>
<br/>
Old Blue and I were so proud of ourselves when, beginning with only 1 of the <br/>
Redwall Series stamps, on the weekend of the Stamping in the Meadow event, we <br/>
were able to record ALL the rest of the Redwall Series in our respective <br/>
journals save ONE. Arriving home, patting ourselves on the back and making a pact <br/>
to return for that one last mammal of a brilliant stamp, now we find there's <br/>
yet another to find????!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bring them on!! the more the merrier!! these stamps are the most wonderful <br/>
you'll find anywhere and we encourage all who haven't tried to locate one. <br/>
You'll be hooked!<br/>
