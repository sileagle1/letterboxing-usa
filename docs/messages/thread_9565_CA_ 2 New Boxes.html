Placed by: Threedigs<br/>
Placed on: 12/3/02<br/>
County: Los Angeles<br/>
Nearest City: Altadena<br/>
Distance: 3/4 mile<br/>
Difficulty: Easy<br/>
<br/>
     This box is located at the Eaton Canyon Nature Area in Altadena <br/>
(near Pasadena).  For specific directions you can go to the park's <br/>
website at http://www.ecnca.org/.  Admission is free, and the hike is <br/>
quite manageable with children or infant joggers.<br/>
     When you arrive, park in the second parking lot and walk past <br/>
the yellow gate at the north end of the lot.  Follow the main path <br/>
past several picnic areas, downhill, and across the creek bed.  At <br/>
the fork, turn left.<br/>
     You will go up a steady incline at the top of which is a large <br/>
clearing.  Continue going straight.  You will pass two large trees, <br/>
one on either side of the trail.  Continue to a large five-trunked <br/>
tree on your left.  Make a left turn here (where the rock is) and <br/>
head off the main trail.  You will see a patch of prickly pear on <br/>
your left.  <br/>
     Continue 37 paces to a rocky area in fron of a large grove of <br/>
trees.  There is some poison oak here, so be cautious.  From the <br/>
beginning of the rocky section, head 28 paces south to a large five-<br/>
trunked tree.  The box is hidden in the center of the trunks.<br/>

ANOTHER WATERFALL LETTERBOX<br/>
Placed by: Threedigs<br/>

County: Los Angeles<br/>
Nearest City: Monrovia<br/>
Distance: 1.5 miles (half that if you don't go all the way to the <br/>
falls)<br/>
Difficulty: Easy/Moderate<br/>
<br/>
     This box is located in Monrovia Canyon Park, a wilderness are in <br/>
the foothills above Monrovia, Arcadia, and Duarte.  Directions to the <br/>
park can be found at <br/>
http://www.ci.monrovia.ca.us/city_hall/public_works/canyon_park/canyon<br/>
_park.htm.  Parking is $2 per vehicle.  The trail can be hiked with <br/>
children or with infants in backpacks.  It can be done with a jogger <br/>
(we have), but it's difficult.<br/>
     Once paying at the park's entrance, follow the road up as far as <br/>
it goes.  At the top will be the Nature Center.  The Canyon Waterfall <br/>
Trail begins behind the Nature Center.  It initially goes downhill, <br/>
where you will come to a fork.  At the fork, turn right.  From here <br/>
the trail will go uphill to the waterfall, about 1/2 a mile away.  <br/>
There are no other forks or trail intersections, so enjoy your hike <br/>
at the 30 foot falls at the end.<br/>
     On your way back from the waterfall, stop at the top of the log <br/>
stairway and face east.  You will be looking along a cement erosion <br/>
barrier.  Head north and work your way east through the clearing, <br/>
staying as close to the barrier as possible.  If you are searching <br/>
for this box in early spring this may involve crossing the creek.<br/>
     At the eastern end of this barrier (about 30 feet from the <br/>
stairs) you will see where the creek flows down the canyon.  However, <br/>
if you look further east, you will see one more small section of the <br/>
wall sticking out from the east rock face.  You will need to reach <br/>
this section of wall.  When you get there, examine the north side of <br/>
the wall.  There is a large rock leaning against it, with a couple of <br/>
small rocks in the crevice between it and the wall.  Remove these <br/>
small rocks to find the box.  As always, be careful when reaching <br/>
into crevices and potential critter holes.<br/>
