	I'd say that part of the simple fact that some people are<br/>
teachers and some are not. And those that are not just won't or can't.<br/>
Trust me, it's hard to learn the right and wrongs things, the do's and<br/>
don'ts, that what's acceptable and what's not when no one will tell you<br/>
until after you've tried something.<br/>
<br/>
	Thanks for sharing your words Paul, can't wait till we can get<br/>
back to San Francisco and search for your boxes!<br/>
