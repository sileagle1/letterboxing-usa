am asking for info on the boxes in the states listed above.  I have <br/>
not set a firm route yet, but have some leeway in my travel plans!!  <br/>
I can't stand to drive back the same way I came when I take a real <br/>
road trip!!  I am interested in easy, semi-kid-friendly (if I can do <br/>
it, my daughter can too!!) and preferably not missing boxes (aren't <br/>
most  (; ).  I would greatly appreciate any info any of you can give <br/>
to me.  Please e-mail info to my e-mail address (at the bottom of <br/>
this post, also at the top) as I don't want to clog up the list.  I <br/>
will let everyone know what my "plan" is just in case anyone wants to <br/>
do an exchange!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all in advance!!<br/>
