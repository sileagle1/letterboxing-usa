                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I decided that since I had about  hour of free time I could 1) Clean my house or 2) Run out and get the Peace letterbox in Windham and check on my Windham Jail Break box. The latter idea won out. I strapped three-year-old Rosie Bunny in the car and headed out. Got to the cemetery and found PEACE. I brought it back to the van to stamp in. As I am stamping away and trying to write a clever little note I noticed a car pull up behind me and then to start to back out of the path I am parked on. The car parked a little further down and a man let his dog out to run around the cemetery. I began putting everything back into the box and tried to think of how to get the box back in place without drawing attention to myself and the hiding place. I look up and there is a different man looking in my window. So not to look suspicious I let out a blood curdling "BLAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!" and tossed the box to the floor. Looking confused and very curious he peddled away on his bike but continued to keep an eye on my van. I decided Peace would have to take a ride with me until the coast was clear. I drove around for 15 minutes and return to find people still there. So I drove off again. Long story short Peace visited Windham, Sprague, and Scotland before returning to Windham an hour later. The three-year-old was less than thrilled. The cemetery was empty when I returned but I became a total freak darting to the hiding place and leaping back into my car in record time. I never did check on Windham Jail-break. Anyway the Peace box is fine except the baggie it is in has a broken zipper and it was pretty exposed when I got there but that may be from spring thaw. <br/>
