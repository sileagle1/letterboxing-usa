                    <div class="plaintext-content">Speaking of hitchhikers, I'm reminded that I neglected to report that over the weekend "Rubythroat" HH finally found a box to hover in 'til found again.  My family had a fun time over Memorial weekend biking, hiking, and observing cicadas in Green Lane Park, PA.  We had time to access a couple of the several boxes there-- the trees, to be exact, and were happy to finally be able to squeeze that HH in.  Very nifty spot for one of the tree boxes.  If someone on this list happens to get there soon and find Rubythroat HH,  we forgot to stamp it into the tablet in the host box, so we'd be grateful if you could do that. We felt bad when we remembered that on the way home.  HikersnHounds, we loved your stamp in the book!  My kids love MC Escher, and thought of the resemblances. It was great to finally see a lot of stamps.  One more lesson learned on that trip-- don't put clue sheets in your back pocket when biking!  As a seasoned cyclist, I should have known better.  Or maybe my bum has grown-- the clues dropped out of my back pocket, and we did the loop around the lake again to look for them.  Luckily found them.  I was so bummed at first that I considered asking the camp office staff if I could use their computer!  Now I wish I could tell you if we were at the reservoir or the lake, but that park is such a convoluted place that they are mixed up in my mind.  If someone wants to know, email me and I'll find out.  We failed to find the mystery box; the road name we thought was the right one was not where it was supposed to be on a mapquest map.  Big shocker there--mapquest is often useless in this area where the roads change names every 1/2-mile.    --lunaryakketyact<br/>
