I don't have an answer for you.<br/>
<br/>
I have only recently started to letterbox. In that time, I've found 2<br/>
hitchhikers. I moved them along and emailed the owners about were their<br/>
HH's had been. But I never got any response from them. It's as if they<br/>
didn't care to hear any updates. So it's kind of the flip side to your<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
One can only do so much. Then it depends on other kind folk to keep the<br/>
ball rolling (or is it keep the hitchhiker hiking?).<br/>
<br/>
I haven't placed any Hitchhikers yet, and am not really very excited to<br/>
plant any, anytime soon.<br/>

initially heard about them regularly as they moved around the<br/>
country, I have heard nothing for almost a year now.  What is<br/>
amazing is that 3 of them were last released in big letterboxing<br/>
areas (Northeast, Mid-Atlantic &amp; Pacific Northwest).  I enjoy<br/>
hearing from people when they find my Hitchhikers because I<br/>
have web pages for each with all their travel history.  I guess<br/>
there are several possible reasons I have not heard anything:  <br/>
they were placed in boxes that went missing, they were placed in <br/>
boxes nobody visits, they are in somebody's possession or they <br/>
are doing fine but not being reported on.  When I find a HH I <br/>
always report it to the owner and the Travelers Talklist so<br/>
Wanda &amp; Pete will also know about it, so I would hope everyone <br/>
else does the same thing.  I know this probably isn't the case<br/>
but I will continue to hope for the best and keep waiting for<br/>
my little vagabonds to resurface, and possibly send out a few<br/>
more to look for them.  Hang in there!<br/>

<br/>
The ADG has placed at least 10 hitchhikers and most of them are <br/>
probably long gone.  However we did receive 2 back in the mail.  Let <br/>
me tell you, those were some pretty good days!  Keeping the logbook <br/>
small seems to help since the hitcher won't be out quite as long and <br/>
a small stamp means that the hitcher will fit comfortably in all but <br/>
a micro box.  Putting stamps and a return address in a small <br/>
envelope in the back of the hitcher will help you guarantee its <br/>
return.  Surprisingly we received both hitchhikers back with the <br/>
postage still in the envelope.  (see, letterboxers are decent people <br/>
we just don't want everyone to know it!)<br/>
<br/>
Plus in the world of "buy one, get one free" a hitcher seems only <br/>
natural.  Free, good word.  <br/>

Oh Jay - sweet delight for sharing - thank you! <br/>
Sun Ra Orchesktra for other folks is a sort of funky fusion jazz experimental group <br/>
around since the 70's and I just love them.  http://www.missioncreep.com/mw/<br/>
sunra.html  <br/>
<br/>
I made that hitchhiker on a whim so it is just nice to know that others have found <br/>
it. I should have included more info in the lobgook cover about the origins of the <br/>
group and the stamp itself. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the ever-so-timely-update! <br/>

We have also not seen our share of HH's in our wanderings. We've not heard from the Troll or his hair and A Major award fell off the face of the earth just after planting.<br/>
One possible reason the HH's are not moving about is that when 'we' plant boxes, the actual boxes are not large enough to accommodate the original LB and a HH. One of our first boxes was a prime example - we have since fixed that problem - new box with plenty of breathing room. <br/>
Also, since Dave and I have started boxing (only a year ago!) many boxes were removed from the LBNA website - some are still out there. A fine example are the two boxes on the Long trail at the Appalachian Gap. Perhaps the HH's don't get moved around because they're sleeping in one of these "unclaimed" boxes.<br/>
We are going to do our best to send the Great Pumpkin HH on it's way this weekend. We picked it up at Enigma Stone in VT. I'll be sending an official update to Wanda and Pete for their HH website.<br/>

  Ooops....I must admit I'm guilty...I must not have e-mailed you <br/>
that I picked up "The Troll's Hair" at the May Day Gathering in CT on <br/>
5-2-04...so sorry, Dave &amp; Diane :(<br/>
  It has been sent on its way again though.<br/>
<br/>
  Myself, being pretty new at letterboxing, at first, it was a great <br/>
novelty to pick up a HH and send it off again, but now it seems like <br/>
it's too difficult to find a roomy enough box to put it in, or a <br/>
roomy hiding place to fit it in, and it takes me way too long to do <br/>
all the exchanging of stamps once I do find a good host for it.  <br/>
Another factor for me is that I try to find a host box that seems to <br/>
get a lot of visits so that the HH moves on quickly.  All in all, the <br/>
HH could be sitting in my pack for quite a while (not forgotten) <br/>
until the ideal spot for it has been found.  So...now I feel I'm <br/>
doing it a favor by not picking it up!!!  Ideally, a HH should be <br/>
small enough to fit inside another Box, (in just a baggie, rather <br/>
than a container) then part of the problem would be solved.  (Troll's <br/>
Hair was a nice small one though, if I remember correctly)<br/>
<br/>
  Any suggestions, please?.....thanks....Sue<br/>

 I was having the same problem here in Oregon, trying to find a box that was<br/>
big enough to leave a hitchhiker in, so I took it upon myself to do two<br/>
things. #1, I planted boxes big enough for hitchhikers to be left in, and<br/>
#2, I started adding a line to my clues that tells whether the box is<br/>
hitchhiker friendly. That way people know before they head out whether they<br/>
can leave a hitchhiker there. I know several times I've gone out with the<br/>
specific purpose of getting a hitchhiker on it's way and not been able to.<br/>

 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Ideally, a HH should be<br/>
small enough to fit inside another Box, (in just a baggie, rather<br/>
than a container) then part of the problem would be solved.  (Troll's<br/>
Hair was a nice small one though, if I remember correctly)<br/>

  Any suggestions, please?.....thanks....Sue<br/>

    Ooops....I must admit I'm guilty...I must not have e-mailed you <br/>

  5-2-04...so sorry, Dave &amp; Diane :(<br/>
    It has been sent on its way again though.<br/>
<br/>
    Myself, being pretty new at letterboxing, at first, it was a great <br/>
  novelty to pick up a HH and send it off again, but now it seems like <br/>
  it's too difficult to find a roomy enough box to put it in, or a <br/>
  roomy hiding place to fit it in, and it takes me way too long to do <br/>
  all the exchanging of stamps once I do find a good host for it.  <br/>
  Another factor for me is that I try to find a host box that seems to <br/>
  get a lot of visits so that the HH moves on quickly.  All in all, the <br/>
  HH could be sitting in my pack for quite a while (not forgotten) <br/>
  until the ideal spot for it has been found.  So...now I feel I'm <br/>
  doing it a favor by not picking it up!!!  Ideally, a HH should be <br/>
  small enough to fit inside another Box, (in just a baggie, rather <br/>

I believe it's done to get us to go out and find more boxes in hopes of maybe finding another bonus. One of our first mystery boxes that we found here in RI had a 'piggy-back' bonus box - the clues to another box were tucked inside to 'lure' you into another search. "Gotta get 'em all".<br/>

&gt; My son and I just found the Troll's hair over the weekend.  His <br/>
hair has been transplanted :-) as of this afternoon.  Hopefully, we <br/>
will meet the troll himself.  This was our second HH we've come <br/>
across in 27 finds.  The hair was found in the Ansonia Nature Center. <br/>

&gt; We have also not seen our share of HH's in our wanderings. We've <br/>
not heard from the Troll or his hair and A Major award fell off the <br/>
face of the earth just after planting.<br/>
&gt; One possible reason the HH's are not moving about is that when 'we' <br/>
plant boxes, the actual boxes are not large enough to accommodate the <br/>
original LB and a HH. One of our first boxes was a prime example - we <br/>
have since fixed that problem - new box with plenty of breathing <br/>
room. <br/>
&gt; Also, since Dave and I have started boxing (only a year ago!) many <br/>
boxes were removed from the LBNA website - some are still out there. <br/>
A fine example are the two boxes on the Long trail at the Appalachian <br/>
Gap. Perhaps the HH's don't get moved around because they're sleeping <br/>
in one of these "unclaimed" boxes.<br/>
&gt; We are going to do our best to send the Great Pumpkin HH on it's <br/>
way this weekend. We picked it up at Enigma Stone in VT. I'll be <br/>
sending an official update to Wanda and Pete for their HH website.<br/>

&gt;   I would like to take this time to state my feelings on <br/>
hitchhikers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I haven't done very many. Three Maine Shells and Sun Ra <br/>
Orchesktra.  I don't ever <br/>
&gt;   see anything online about them. I don't know where they are. I <br/>
don't know where <br/>
&gt;   thye've been. Frankly, I think they are gone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Where do hitchiikers really go? Why do they stay in people's <br/>
backpacks - or on their <br/>
&gt;   kitchen tables - or whathaveyou? What is the point?!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   There was some recent clammering about this subject on Mark <br/>
Pepe's page asking <br/>
&gt;   about hostels and the like. What came of this? Yes, Wanda and <br/>
Pete maintain a <br/>
&gt;   fabulous log of them, but as for the original parents of these <br/>
little guys? Well, I'm a <br/>
&gt;   terrible parent, no news of these guys makes me very sad :-( <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   What do you folks think? What about the future of hitchhikers??! <br/>
