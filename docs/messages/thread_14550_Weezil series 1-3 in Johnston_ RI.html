State: Rhode Island<br/>
County: Providence <br/>
Nearest city: Johnston<br/>
Number of boxes: 3<br/>
<br/>
Clues<br/>
This set of boxes begins the Weezil series- a series of boxes <br/>
commemorating the joys of ferrets. <br/>
Location: Nature Trails across from Johnston Memorial Park (where you <br/>
can also find the missing mascot)<br/>
<br/>
Weezil 1 -----------------------------------------------------<br/>
Park in the small lot on the left side of the road, rather than the <br/>
park's lot on the right. Scamper down the main entrance trail to <br/>
reach the red trail. Follow the red trail NW, passing the Duck Plaque <br/>
and crossing several dried stream beds. Stop at the last red-blazed <br/>
tree before getting too close too the water- if you come to where the <br/>
large logs dump out into the bubbly brook, you've gone too far. From <br/>
the tree with the red blaze, take 13 paces headed SE, in the <br/>
direction you came from. Weasle your way to the box on your left.<br/>
Weezil 2 ------------------------------------------------------ <br/>
Head back the way you came. Take a left onto orange where orange and <br/>
red blazes intersect at a T. At the next T intersection, go north on <br/>
yellow. Pass Chipmunk plaque. Before reaching Raccoon plaque, follow <br/>
orange trail at fork on right. At fourth tree blazed in NEW orange <br/>
(disregard old and faded bands of orange), scurry SE to sparse <br/>
remains of a stone wall. Ferret the box out here. Either finish the <br/>
orange loop or skedaddle back the way you came.<br/>
Weezil 3 ------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Scutter back on yellow towards beginnings of trails. Return to where <br/>
your car is parked, and steathily wiggle to the west corner of this <br/>
small lot. Hunker down on the last large rock on the western end of <br/>
the stone wall, view the waterfall, and inconspicuously reach under <br/>
your seat. Finally, you've rounded up all of the day's weasles. <br/>

Was heading out for a little letterboxing this morning and decided to visit your Weezil series.  I was the first and enjoyed the hike with my golden. Saw one of the largest Great Blue Heron I've ever seen in the pond by the dam. Beautiful carved stamps. (I've got 3 ferrits living in my house) I also brought the Celtic Ring of Karma HH Home with me. It's fitting, my llama is named Karma.<br/>
