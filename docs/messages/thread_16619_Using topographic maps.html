I see at least one person has suggested GPSes, but that's a wussy way <br/>
of figuring out the latitude and longitude of where you are.  REAL <br/>
men (and women) figure such stuff out the old fashioned way.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, an easy way to figure out your latitude (at least if <br/>
you're in the northern hemishere) is to measure how far above the <br/>
horizon Polaris (the North Star) is located.  The number of degrees <br/>
it is above the horizon is what your latitude is.  Very easy to <br/>
measure.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't figured out an *easy* way to measure longitude on the <br/>
trail, but Lewis and Clark--if I recall correctly--would do stuff <br/>
like find the position of the moon's of Jupiter at a certain time and <br/>
after returning back to civilization could look up what the <br/>
longitutde was based on such measurements.  Even that famous duo had <br/>
trouble measuring longitude while on the trail.  But perhaps with <br/>
today's maps, at least you can make sure you're "close enough" and <br/>
not need to be as precise as that.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!  =)<br/>
