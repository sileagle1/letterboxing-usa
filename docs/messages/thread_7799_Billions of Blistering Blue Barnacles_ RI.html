A GREAT multitude of VERY HUNGRY mosquitos zoomed in on <br/>
us, so we cleared out of there as fast as we could!!   I have <br/>
experienced mosquito problems in other areas but that evening <br/>
must have been their Feast Day or something.<br/>

Nevertheless, we'll be back to stamp up after a frost gets 'em!  <br/>
We often go shopping in nearby Narragansett which also has a <br/>
nice library and some good restaurants.<br/>

&gt; The box was well hidden, but easy to find.  Given my recent <br/>
work history, I<br/>
&gt; got a real chuckle out of the stamp.  I wasn't the first to find this <br/>
box,<br/>

been in such a<br/>

summer of almost no rain in the south part of town this summer seems to have<br/>
brought a season's worth of mosquitoes all in one day.  Folks, don't even<br/>
think about boxing around here without mosquito repellent, and if you are in<br/>
frail health you might want to give the wetlands areas a pass, what with the<br/>
threat of West Nile.  I doused myself with Off, including under my shirt,<br/>
and they still found a couple of spots to nip me.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>Just returned from our 8 days on the east coast. Only had so much time but went looking for 14 letterboxes and ended up with 9 which I'm happy with (NONE of the ones on Nantucket were there. . .bummer as I biked 25+ miles for them!!)
<br/>
<br/>Billions of Blistering. . . .was great although when we were there (Sept. 25) it was more like Billions of Fiesty Mosquitoes!! Also got Pt. Judith (my favorite stamp so far) May Basket, A Trip Through Town, Old Mansfield Cemetery and KJ's Best, where my husband finally jumped on the bandwagon and bought himself a stamp to enjoy the hunting even more with me. Seems you 2 where one step ahead of us the whole time!! Fun. 
<br/>
<br/>Wish we hadn't had a plane to catch as I would have loved to take advantage of the Mecca that Mansfield/Coventry is!! Next trip!
