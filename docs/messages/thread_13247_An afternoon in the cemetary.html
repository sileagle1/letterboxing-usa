up on that hill, CardinalMom, the kids, and I ventured up to <br/>
Grandview Cemetary in Chillicothe, OH and located 4 of Salamander's <br/>
boxes.  We started with "Mistletoe &amp; Holly", then "Governor's Rest" <br/>
(Adina tried really hard to be inconspicuous to the walkers in the <br/>
area as she retrieved this one from a rather exposed position.), <br/>
then "Luna Verde" (where we were rewarded with the "Legends Live <br/>
Forever" hitchhiker), and finally we were privileged to be First <br/>
Finders of "Lonesome Pine".  All boxes were dry and in good shape and <br/>
Salamander's stamps are great as always.  An added bonus was the <br/>
spectacular view from the ridge.  I'll bet many a developer has shed <br/>
bitter tears that the best views in the city belong to those who <br/>
don't get much benefit from them.<br/>
