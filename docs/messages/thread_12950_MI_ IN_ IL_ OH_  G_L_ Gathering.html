have sent out a couple of e-mails with detailed information regarding <br/>
the Great Lakes Letterbox Gathering being held at Waterloo Rec Area <br/>
(Chelsea, MI) on May 31, to everyone who had e-mailed me expressing <br/>
an interest to attend, and a few others I was aware of in the area.<br/>
<br/>
If there are any letterboxers out there in or out of the Great Lakes <br/>
region, who were not on my mailing list, and are interested in <br/>
further information, please e-mail me at:<br/>
<br/>
springchick at letterbox-mi.com<br/>
<br/>
You can also check out the event information page here:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.confessionsofdecember.com/extras/lb_gather.asp<br/>
<br/>
There are only a couple of spots left at the carving workshop and the <br/>
log books workshop, so if you have not already contacted me about <br/>
attending these and would like to do so, please e-mail me soon.<br/>
<br/>
And also, I would like to say a huge thank you to those you <br/>
contributed Visit Michigan letterboxes for the gathering.  There is a <br/>
great variety of themes and all the stamps are great!  Thanks for <br/>
your part in making our first event sure to be a success!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing everyone there!<br/>
