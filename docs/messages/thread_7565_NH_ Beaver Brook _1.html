<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks to those who provided additional clues &amp; 
encouragement to Beaver Brook #1 in Hollis, NH.  We found it yesterday, on 
a sizzling hot hike that was well worth the perspiration!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We laughed out loud at all the others who'd left 
notes in the letterbox commenting about how many times they too thought they'd 
found "the" cliff... as we did.  </div>
<div><br/>But oooooooh, victory is VERY sweet when a challenging box is 
found!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I wouldn't rate these clues easy, because there are a bazillion smaller 
boulders and rocks split by trees that look sort of like hands.  And I 
think we passed five rounded cliff-type locations before we reached the right 
one.  My advice is, if you aren't sure if the rock you're looking at is the 
one that's pointy on top, like a ^, then you're not at the right cliff yet. 
*chuckle*</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was a very worthwhile hike for a hand-carved stamp, and we had a 
glorious time, even in yesterday's heat.  Thanks!</div>
<div><br/>Cheerfully,<br/>Ais</div></body></html>
