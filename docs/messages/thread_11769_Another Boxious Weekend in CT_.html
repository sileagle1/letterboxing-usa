be a boxious weekend in CT!  Once the rain died down at around 4:30 on <br/>
Saturday afternoon, I was able to (finally) get The Red Men at Holbrook Pond <br/>
and the new Peggy Dow, both in Hebron!  Red Men was where I expected it to <br/>
be, however, the first time I went out to look for it, it was frozen solid in <br/>
a block of snowy ice!  Peggy Dow is in a really cool, old cemetery, so if you <br/>
are into those kinds of things (like I am).... definitely go and check it <br/>
out!  Irishtinker did a great job on the stamp too!<br/>
<br/>
Sunday proved to be a better boxing day!  Though I was in church until 12:30, <br/>
I still was able to pick up 18 boxes and one Hitchhiker by 6 pm!  I started <br/>
off by grabbing the fifth box in the Women of the Revolutionary War series, <br/>
since I couldn't find it the first time in the huge amounts of snow we had <br/>
this winter!  I also picked up the Connecticut State Stamp by the Needeeps!  <br/>
Nathan Hale Forest is becoming a boxing mecca!  Then off to find Watership <br/>
Downs and Presidential Animals.  In the third box of Presidential Animals, I <br/>
found the Lantern Light Hitchhiker!  I'll replant it sometime soon!  I want <br/>
to put it into a second baggie since the pen doesn't really fit very well in <br/>
the present baggie.  Then off to Mansfield to grab the two new Vinton <br/>
Elementary School boxes: Winterfest and Chico y Frio Hermano, followed by the <br/>
"Puzzles are Double the Fun" letterboxes in Mansfield Depot.  Oy.... every <br/>
box required the letterboxer to solve a puzzle..... I'm just lucky I found <br/>
them all!  Then I went over to KJ's and grabbed some ice cream (I already <br/>
have the box), then went over and stamped into the Queen of Hearts, Cupid's <br/>
Letterbox and Cupid's Arrow.  Finally, I went and found Fireman2B's box, <br/>
Eagleville Dam.  All boxes were in semi good condition (some in better <br/>
condition than others).<br/>
<br/>
Just a note on the boxes themselves.  I found that many boxes in the woods <br/>
today were made from the thin Glad boxes and such.  I can already tell you <br/>
that these boxes won't last.  The Queen of Hearts box has a crack in it, as <br/>
does Eagleville Dam, if I remember correctly.  I would check on these boxes <br/>
often, since they are easily crackable. (is that a word????)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hope everyone had a great boxious day!<br/>
