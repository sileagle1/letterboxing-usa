                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well ,I'm sorry. How could I possibly know that there could be other letterboxers lurking about the Kernville area. No one has checked our plethora of letterboxes in a while so I figured I would sneak one up to Boone Meadow for Gwennies birthday and plant  letterbox # 127. I put it out on June 22, but didn't post the clues til July 4 after she found it. She didn't get any "First Finders" certificate as we don't put those things in any of our letterboxes. She did spend a great day on a fairly short hike with our son, daughter-in-law, grandson#1, and me. The meadow  was green and lush,with the little creek full of little fish and uninhabited by people, and for California that is really something on a holiday. All in all it was the type of day and experience that we hope one has while chasing after one of our letterboxes. So if someone is upset when they check on this letterbox and find that someone beat them to it, please except this apology ahead of time and just look around at what your search has brought you and enjoy the moment because that is the best part.<br/>
