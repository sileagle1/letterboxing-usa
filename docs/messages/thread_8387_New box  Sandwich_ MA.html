<br/>
Location:  State: MA   County: Barnstable   Town: Sandwich  <br/>
       Scusset Beach Reservation<br/>
<br/>
Planted by: Tweety and Mr. Coon  10/13/02<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Easy 20 minute walk with a gentle grade but a great view. <br/>
<br/>
Driving directions: From Rt. 195 east go south on Rt.25 towards the <br/>
Bourne Bridge. Turn off at the last exit before the bridge, go around <br/>
the rotary (past the landlocked tugboat) and go around the rotary and <br/>
follow Rt. 6 under the bridge to parallel the canal. There are two <br/>
scenic turnoffs on the right side of the road, the second of which <br/>
gives spectacular views of the canal, its valley, and the glacial <br/>
moraines that form the part of Cape Cod next to the canal on the <br/>
other side. At the bottom of the hill lies the Herring Run Recreation <br/>
Area in Bournedale where there really is a  herring run and there is <br/>
also a nature trail that leads from here. <br/>
If you continue on Rt 6 to the Sagamore Bridge rotary ( intersection <br/>
with Rt. 3 coming down from Boston)  take the second turn paast the <br/>
bridge ( Scusset Beach Road) from the rotary  and follow it to the <br/>
end it takes you to Scusset beach and camping area, a place worth <br/>
investigating. Before the campground there is a large parking area <br/>
right next to the canal where there are restroom facilities, snack <br/>
bar and tables overlooking the canal. The docks here are a popular <br/>
fishing spot. Park here and walk across the street away from the <br/>
canal to find the trail entrance for Sagamore Hill. <br/>
<br/>
Sagamore Hill Coastal Artillery Camp.  According to the signs there <br/>
native people once used this as a council gathering spot. Throughout <br/>
World War II this was the location of Battery C of the 241st Coast <br/>
Artillery. A level area just below the hilltop was the site of the <br/>
camps barracks and building and near the summit are the remains of <br/>
the gun mounts and ammunition storage bunkers. The hilltop commands a <br/>
sweeping view of Cape Cod Bay and the entrance to the canal. The 155 <br/>
mm coastal guns located here had a range of 20 miles. <br/>
<br/>
Directions to the box: <br/>
Head up the right hand trail to the top of the hill. This leads up to <br/>
a small clearing remnant of the area where the camp was. Continue up <br/>
a trail to the left and after a very short and easy incline you'll <br/>
reach the ammo bunkers. To your right lies the first of the gun <br/>
mounts. Continue to the summit. Another gun mount lies on the <br/>
downslope beyond the top. Stop and read the Changes Through Time <br/>
sign. Do an about face and, looking almost due west ( 244 degrees by <br/>
our reckoning) spot a sickly multi-trunked cherry tree about 20 steps <br/>
away. Amidst the base of its trunks the box should lie under some <br/>
sticks and debris.  <br/>
On your way back down the hill you may choose to follow the trail <br/>
(the old camp road) that branches to the left after the camp clearing <br/>
to have a different return route. If you do take the left hand trail <br/>
(a slightly longer walk back) be sure you bear to the right when you <br/>
come to a fork in that trail in order to return to the starting gate. <br/>
You'll know you're on the right track when you pass by a building and <br/>
some storage tanks enclosed in a fence.<br/>
There are several other letterboxes in the vicinity of the canal.   <br/>
