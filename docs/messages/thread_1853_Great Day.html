                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to Jay Drew  and his Trout Fishing in North America and <br/>
Watermelon Sugar, and  Deb Perry's Special Snowflake we added 3 to <br/>
our count today. It was such a nice sunny day and both parks were <br/>
very pretty in the new dusting of snow.  Have a new  speedball <br/>
carving set and I'm very busy with it. where will I put all the <br/>
boxes? I'm sure I'm going to find a lot of new parks through spring. <br/>
 So thanks Drews and Perry for helping our count thats 3 Drew boxes <br/>
down and hundreds to go!    Carol <br/>
