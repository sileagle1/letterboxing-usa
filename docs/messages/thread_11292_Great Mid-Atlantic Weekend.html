Just wanted to say what a great time we had in PA the other day - <br/>
our first mid Atlantic letterboxing weekend in almost a year!  <br/>
Seems we went down with winter and came back with spring!  <br/>
Boxes we spent hours digging for in vain under piles of snow on <br/>
our first day out began miraculously appearing during the next <br/>
day or two under logs and rocks whose existence we would not <br/>
even have previously surmised!  In all we found about 2 dozen <br/>
boxes, including a few more mapsurfers.  They were all in good <br/>
condition.  We also dropped off a bunch of hitchers who had <br/>
been traveling with us for a while.  The high point of the trip, <br/>
however, was meeting up with the mapsurfer again, and also <br/>
making the acquaintance of a fun group of fellow mapsurfer box <br/>
enthusiasts.  The "Wasabi Gathering" featured not only fine <br/>
cuisine, interesting conversation and 2 wonderful event stamps, <br/>
but also a host of nested hitchers, including the cutest <br/>
imaginable micro hitcher with cuckoo!  Thanks again to the <br/>
mapsurfer and everyone else who helped make the weekend so <br/>
special!<br/>
