coolness.  In the winter they will den up in rocky areas in large <br/>
numbers.  It is recommended that you try to poke around with a stick <br/>
before putting your hand into small spaces.<br/>

The snake was probably more frightened than you were.<br/>

I haven't run into any snakes yet (at least not in letterbox hiding places, <br/>

did lift a rock off a geocache in Florida and find a large wolf spider <br/>
waiting for me. I'm not a big fan of spiders or snakes....<br/>

I probably would have fainted. I have "SNAKE PHOBIA"<br/>
me &amp; Brian have a very strict snake ritual when we go out<br/>
First, I make HIM look at the little nooks and crannies that<br/>
I think the box might be in. (He's my hero) and if we're in<br/>
snake territory, I set the pace, which is usually fast (I do <br/>
this little hop, skip and jump step with a waving of my arms<br/>
that must look like have some kind of palsy)<br/>
and I hum and he tells me stories. If I actually SEE a snake<br/>
(or even a twig) I run right into his arms and he holds me<br/>
til I stop shaking. All in all, I spend most of my letterboxing<br/>
time terrified that I'll even see a snake, but since I havent<br/>
gotten bit yet, I've decided that 'boxing just may help me<br/>
get my terror under control.<br/>

<br/>
Before we learned about letterboxing, we were hiking out<br/>
in Arcadia State Park in Bar Harbor, Maine.<br/>
<br/>
Brian looked up and said to me "What the heck is that?" as he<br/>
pointed to the strangest looking creature that I have ever<br/>
seen outside of captivity.  I said "It's a monkey" to which<br/>
he replied "Ya think?"  We cautiously walked closer to the<br/>
animal in question. We speculated that it couldn't possibly<br/>
be a monkey. We observed it picking leaves from the tree in which<br/>
it was sitting in and putting the leaves in its mouth. The animal<br/>
never acknowledge us and as we came (very cautiously) closer<br/>
to the animal, we were able to detect spines and a long tail and <br/>
agreed with each other that it was a porcupine. The little guy<br/>
looked like he could use a shower but he allowed us to just watch<br/>
him eat his leaf snacks for about 5 minutes from 5 feet away. We <br/>
speculated that he was unconcerned about us because of his defense<br/>
mechanism (ouchy spines).  Finally, we decided to let him finish<br/>
his meal in peace and we walked along talking about how we really<br/>
should bring a camera with us when we go out. <br/>

very interested in letterboxing. I've never run into anything scary, <br/>
but then again, I find it fun to go looking for snakes and such.<br/>

&gt; Well, I do know that if you meet a nocturnal animal moseying about <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the daytime and if it's not because you've disturbed it, then it may<br/>
&gt; have rabies.  When a raccoon was out one afternoon, we were warned <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; turn around and leave the area until the ranger could assess the<br/>
&gt; situation.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I don't worry about snakes, but has anyone ever had an encounter<br/>
&gt; with a porcupine, raccoon or other nocturnal animal?  I'm not sure <br/>
how<br/>
&gt; to tell where they live or what I'd do if I disturbed one.  Just<br/>
