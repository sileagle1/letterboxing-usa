Saturday afternoon was gorgeous, and we decided to take advantage of it and<br/>
finish our search for Irelands Four Provinces in the Patuxent River Park at Jug<br/>
Bay. We had found two in early November, only to be frustrated because we<br/>
werent sure how to triangulate. Now, we decided to return, having boned up on<br/>
Wilderness Navigation and Randy Halls The Letterboxers Companion.<br/>
<br/>
It was great walk, with a good thumbnail history of Ireland  including some<br/>
comparative topography. The Four Provinces come together by solving clues that<br/>
range from relatively simple to challenging. Make sure you bring your<br/>
waterproofed hiking shoes  rather muddy in parts. This is also a good set of<br/>
stamps to use your colored markers  thats all well say.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Celtic Pride  theyve given us another great series.<br/>
gg<br/>
P.S. We were first finds on all four!<br/>

<br/>
Not trying to rag on anyone, by the way--one of my favorite trail-running<br/>
trails was marked closed for 2 months after the hurricane, but I ran on it<br/>
anyway, just had to climb over an inordinate number of downed trees. We've<br/>
all got our weird phobias that may not have any relation to actual risks.<br/>
I'm probably more likely to get shot out running at 11 pm at night in an<br/>
area where the occasional murder does take place, than I am out boxing on<br/>
public hunting lands. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I stuck the kids in day camp for the day and took the day off from<br/>
work to go do some mad boxing on my own. Found 7 boxes on 5 trails in 4<br/>
separate parks--logged about 8 miles on the trails! Both Wheaton Regional<br/>
Park boxes are soaked, but I was in a hurry to wrap up before the kids'<br/>
program ended at 4 pm so I couldn't do much about it. They really ought to<br/>
have new everything--new log books, ziplocks, and new container for the<br/>
first one.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;     The problem now is how to identify which boxes<br/>
&gt;   are missing, since they no longer say Abandoned on the new<br/>
&gt;   site (they are just gone), and it would be difficult to<br/>
&gt;   compare the new list with the old one.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   What if several different people worked on this....each <br/>
&gt; doing 1 state or area.  And then sent them<br/>
&gt;   by email to whomever will be doing the website.  I could <br/>
&gt; easily do Colorado (of course we dont have<br/>
&gt;   as many boxes as many other states do)...  Dont you just <br/>
&gt; look on the old site and if it isnt on the new one<br/>
&gt;   then those are your boxes?<br/>

&gt; We went to do these boxes last Saturday, and the trail I thought they were<br/>
&gt; on was marked as closed for the hunting season? There were also hunters<br/>
&gt; parked in the lot, so I just didn't want to risk it. I e-mailed Celtic Pride<br/>

&gt; <br/>
We're not sure that "braver" is the right word.;-) We were there last Saturday<br/>
too - sorry we missed you! We only had the last two boxes to go, and went down a<br/>
different trail than the one you were probably starting on. Out of the corner of<br/>
my eye, I saw a sign that said "managed hunting", but nothing about being<br/>
closed. We did hear two gunshots way off in the distance, which was a little<br/>
creepy. On both days we were in the park with hikers, bikers, equestrians, and<br/>
Boy Scouts. So we didn't feel too vulnerable. And we spoke with several Park<br/>
employees who did not mention anything about hunting - one was actually running<br/>
a front loader and rebuilding a trail.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully "Closed for Hunting" is a temporary state - we think you'll really<br/>
enjoy the series. <br/>
Maybe someday we'll actually meet on the trail.<br/>
happy trails,<br/>
