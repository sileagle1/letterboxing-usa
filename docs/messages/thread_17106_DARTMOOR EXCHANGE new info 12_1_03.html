                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings all Dartmoor Exchangees:<br/>
<br/>
I've been going over a nice email from Graham Howard "The Moorland<br/>
Wizard" tonight, and am posting some of his thoughts here about our<br/>
Dartmoor Exchange for the Spring 2004.  This is what he and his son<br/>
"Dancing Dragon" are thinking of doing for the boxes their sending to<br/>
us.  All I have to say WOW!<br/>
<br/>
So here are some snippets from his letter:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We "would like to set out a (say) one-for-one box for your<br/>
&gt; contributors...and we thought a series to commemorate 400 years of<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing and the mutuality of the US and British boxing spirit...."<br/>
<br/>
&gt; "....but the idea would be to ask each one of them to place<br/>
&gt; and look after one of our boxes as a loose series which if all found <br/>
&gt; made up a complete set.....and ask you / and them to promote them <br/>
&gt; using LBNA and/or NewAge....database is OK !!.......or their own web <br/>
&gt; sites etc....and just see how they went...."<br/>
<br/>
&gt; "...might even draw up a collectors booklet for the (say) half dozen<br/>
&gt; stamps explaining what they depict and why.....These can be posted <br/>
&gt; as a printable file on any website..."<br/>
<br/>
&gt; "Does that sound OK ?"<br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
catbead here: OK? It's FANTASTIC!!!<br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
<br/>
&gt; "Each image would be unique but say within an ornate frame which <br/>
&gt; had the same border style to link the series... (a brand or similar<br/>
style) <br/>
&gt; ...The wording and design of the border would define and describe the <br/>
&gt; series idea....(EG 400th Anniversary...US and UK boxing traditions..or <br/>
&gt; similar idea) and also say "box 1 of 6"  on the first ...and then ..<br/>
"2 of 6"<br/>
&gt; etc....etc."<br/>
<br/>
&gt; "We thought of twin images on each stamp...crossed diagonally so<br/>
there is<br/>
&gt; one image top left and a second bottom right...linking the two global<br/>
&gt; worlds of Letterboxing..."<br/>
<br/>
&gt;"Stamps would be hand drawn / computer aided maybe and made by<br/>
&gt;commercial stamp makers ..(The British way <lol>)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;About 4 inches by "2 and a half inches" roughly rectangular ...landscape"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the end of Graham's letter.<br/>
* * *<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a question here, is 4" x 2 1/2" to big for a stamp?  Without <br/>
losing the Dartmoor essence of the box, would a stamp this size fit in<br/>
most people's log book?<br/>
<br/>

I say let's go for it. Sign Sue &amp; I up to host a box - in fact, we will<br/>
take 1 for VT and 1 for CT if there are some left over!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for spearheading this project!<br/>
<br/>
Relative to the size of the stamp - it seems as most logbooks I have<br/>
seen over the years are roughly 4" x 6" although there may be some<br/>
exceptions.<br/>
<br/>
Sue &amp; I still want to take a trip to the Moor, possibly in the fall of<br/>
2004.<br/>
