                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm happy to see others with my opinion speak up.  Wordsmithing is an art, and some are better at it than others.  I'll never know what causes people to type words of high emotional strength in lieu of other, gentler words when they appear to seek a gentler reproof.  Emotions escalate over the use of a single, unfortunate word very often.<br/>
<br/>
Re-reading one's  own post *before* hitting 'send' can help keep the flames down.  Try putting yourself in the place of someone reading the words without knowing your intended emphasis.  I know - it takes a lot of mental discipline to make the time to edit, and it's just easier and quicker to 'send'.  And then you have to live with the thirty or so follow-up posts.  So do we, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, some folks may be *trying* to be more offensive than corrective.  They may well be thinking "I must stop this heinous action, RIGHT NOW!".  Flaming and shaming someone is a poor form of motivation.<br/>
<br/>
Or, maybe, they just have a poor vocabulary.  A thesaurus is cheap enough.<br/>

  "The unpleasantness baffles me, too.  Why such vehemence?  Why throw the<br/>
  whole book at someone for the whole list to read?  If others of you are<br/>
  tired of people being humiliated here, please speak up.  I'm tired of it and<br/>
  I haven't even been here long.  I think it makes the newer people wonder<br/>
  whether it is related to some kind of past history on here, and yet part of<br/>
  me doesn't even want to know." <br/>
<br/>
  very well said! my sentiments also. a lot of the posts here either are or<br/>
  are on the verge of humiliation. and i also am tired of it. i hesitate to<br/>
  recommend this group to anyone seeking out information on letterboxing.<br/>
  there are some marvelous posts on here and i have gained a lot of insight. i<br/>
  like to think it is only a select few and not the majority that speaks this<br/>
  way. it is a big world out there plenty of room for all of us. let the past<br/>
  die and enjoy the mystery, suspense, elation (feel free to put in your own<br/>
  adjective) of letterboxing and life itself. <br/>
