Just wanted to shout out a warning to any who intend to try for the <br/>
Hughes Hollow box in the McKee-Beesher Wildlife Management Area.  If <br/>
you try for this box, WEAR ORANGE!  Sarah and I were there over the <br/>
holiday weekend and had quite an experience.  We could hear the <br/>
gunshots coming from a short distance but didn't see anyone in the <br/>
area of the letterbox.  Imagine our surprise when we came back out of <br/>
our secluded stand of pines to find a hunter taking aim on the area <br/>
we had just vacated.  He assured us that we were fine, but we are <br/>
glad we weren't wearing beige and olive!  Since I am not a hunter, I <br/>
am not sure how long hunting season lasts but be careful if you visit <br/>
and they are still shootin 'em up.<br/>
<br/>
The area where this box is located is stunning and the stamp is well <br/>
worth the trip. Just be vewy, vewy quiet. <br/>
