                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was in Plymouth this past Thursday for a business retreat and I <br/>
took advantage of the opportunity to finish tracking down the Bunny <br/>
in a Briar Basket.  Once I located the correct property the box <br/>
parctically jumped out at me, but I made extra sure it was well <br/>
hidden when I left.<br/>
<br/>
On my way home on Friday I attempted to find the Scituate Light <br/>
letterbox, without success.  I'm sure it's there, but with the sun <br/>
going down, and me needing a bathroom, I just didn't have the <br/>
patience and concentration that were required.<br/>
<br/>
Kim and I spent part of Sunday and Monday in the Moose Hill Wildlife <br/>
Sanctuary in Sharon, MA.  We found The Bluffs, Moose Hill, and The <br/>
Boulders letterboxes on Sunday, and Hobb's Hill on Monday.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, thanks to Lonemassworlf and You Inspire My Spirit for <br/>
getting us out into the open spaces of Eastern Massachusetts!<br/>
<br/>
Kim and I plan to be at the Big E in Springfield on the 30th, where <br/>
we hope to come across Leader of the Pack's letterboxing booth.  <br/>
Maybe we'll see some of you there as well.<br/>
