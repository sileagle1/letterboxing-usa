                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had fun finding some boxes in Charlotte.  Unfortunately we didn't <br/>
have much time so were only able to look for the 2 in Southwest <br/>
Charlotte: The Visitor and Father's Day/Octopus.  THey were both in <br/>
great shape.  Thanks for hiding them.<br/>
<br/>
We also went to COL Beatty's Park in search of Max's Birthday, but we <br/>
got there at 7:30pm and the gate was closed.  We did go in through <br/>
the exit gate, but found the park ranger on the way in so we had to <br/>
turn around to not be locked in.  <br/>
<br/>
We hid a letterbox in Matthews and will post the clues this week.<br/>
Enjoy.  Thanks again.<br/>
