Wonderful place. I seem to remember being able to see Limerick Nuke Plant cooling towers from there.    So that leads me to believe that you (Katy of Hoodlehead) would be pretty near all the boxes in Green Lane Park.  I've only found 2 of them, but the spot is a nice one overall and there are lots of boxes.  The ones I found had store-bought stamps.  I think some are hand-carved.  If Lansdale is close, that's another idea.  Haven't looked for that box.  Giant Peach in Sellersville shouldn't take long once you find the park, but take boots.  It's been wet around here &amp; that's a low area.  I believe there is also at least one box in Evansburg St. Park.  Haven't looked for it yet either.  It's a forgotten little park with charming walks and interesting history.  Closest towns to that one would be Collegeville, Creamery, Skippack.  I'll keep thinking, and look at a map.  Good Luck!!   --lunaryakketyact<br/>

Camp Hill is where I live. I've been trying to find clues for boxes in this <br/>

I've noticed there are very few boxes listed for anything West of Philadelphia area in PA.  We need more planters out there.  West of you, there are even less.    --lunaryakketyact<br/>
