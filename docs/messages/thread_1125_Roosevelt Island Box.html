                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
The two gray squirrels managed to finally get to Roosevelt Island and look for the letterbox there. Would you believe we had never been there before. We had lots of fun and it was a nice easy walk for us and a beautiful day. We thought we found it and didn't and then we searched some more and couldn't find it. I was stomping all around the ivy and thinking this box must has washed away in one of the high river days so we truned around and were giving up. I reread the clues one last time and there it was, a new clue I had over looked.  So back we went and I went right to the box. YES! there it was and very securely planted I might add.  Nice and dry inside and muddy on the outside. Thank you for another box in the Mid Atlantic Region. The island is very nice and while we were there we hid a box of our own. I will post that soon.<br/>
Thanks for the fun afternoon.<br/>
Squirrel<br/>

I couldn't find the Teddy's Box also on Roosevelt Island.  We found <br/>
what we thought was the grapevine and Large Rock, but no letterbox. <br/>
Squirrel assures me that it is still there, so I am planning to go <br/>
back and try again.<br/>
<br/>
And there is a TON of Poison Ivy in the DC area! Hikers Beware!<br/>

&gt; Hey Everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Was in Washington, D.C. in the beginning of June, and discovered the<br/>
&gt; Roosevelt Island box has gone missing.  I think we followed all the <br/>
clues<br/>
&gt; exactly, we found the old pier and the rock formation with the <br/>
correct<br/>
&gt; bearings, but the box was nowhere to be had.  We did "beat the <br/>
bush" in the<br/>
&gt; surrounding area quite extensively - so I am pretty sure we didn't <br/>
miss it.<br/>
&gt;  The area is a pretty spot with well marked trails and a monument - <br/>
it is a<br/>
&gt; shame the box is gone.  Also, as a sidebar - the clues said the box <br/>
is<br/>
&gt; (was) located in ivy (meaning i guess the common variety ground <br/>
cover ivy)<br/>
&gt; - watch out for some super duper poison ivy mixed in!!!  We <br/>
definitely took<br/>
&gt; home "souvenirs" from that trip!!<br/>

I'm guessing you went out there yesterday, DC was a mess traffic-wise!<br/>
<br/>
I should know, I was one of the cyclists tying up the traffic :)<br/>
<br/>
For those not familiar with what I'm talking about, yesterday an event<br/>
called "BikeDC" was held. It was a 36 mile 100% traffic free ride through<br/>
Downtown DC and the Surrounding Area. 10,000 riders cruising through the<br/>
George Washington Parkway, Whitehurst Freeway and other major DC roads while<br/>
the cars sat and waited for us to finish.<br/>
<br/>
I did debate pulling off the tour for a bit when I saw the signs for<br/>
Roosevelt Island, but decided it might take too long...<br/>
<br/>
Besides, my "Partner in Crime" wasn't with me anyway...<br/>

getting there was a pain.  The good news was it made for excellent <br/>
conditions for Lb'ng, as there wasn't anyone else on the island (almost <br/>
anyway).  The TR stamp is in a most exposed place, and having the island <br/>
clear of folks made it nice. I'll have to tune into the DC Bike day next <br/>
year though.<br/>
