Terrific tour of the park, nice clues, beautiful stamps. Thank you! I <br/>
hate to admit that I've ridden my mountain bike a hundred times there <br/>
and still have never seen Canopy Rock or the lovely trail afterwards <br/>
down by the cove...weird! I liked it so much that I went back and <br/>
planted a letterbox at the end today, and who did I see coming down <br/>
the trail but Pete and Wanda! Great to see you guys again!<br/>
<br/>
Canopy Rock<br/>
We had so much fun at Karen's Haley's Farm letterboxes that we placed <br/>
a tag-along at the end of the trail. Follow Karen's clues from the <br/>
second Haley's Farm letterbox under the railroad tunnel and through <br/>
the wall to Canopy Rock. Continuing down the trail along the cove, <br/>
you'll cross through a major stone wall. Turn north along the stable <br/>
top of the wall to a section of smooth stone. Just beyond, where the <br/>
wall resumes at a sharp-angled corner, find the Canopy Rock Letterbox <br/>
tucked into the north side of the large flat rectangular rock on the <br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
If you're on the CT shore, be sure to enjoy this easy-lovely hike!<br/>

<br/>
I'm so happy that you liked my boxes at Haley's Farm! <br/>
They are my first two, so I was wondering if people<br/>
would like them.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I hate to admit that I've ridden my mountain bike a<br/>
&gt; hundred times there <br/>
&gt; and still have never seen Canopy Rock or the lovely<br/>
&gt; trail afterwards <br/>

<br/>
Funny, the same thing happened to me when I went to<br/>
hunt for your boxes at Rocky Neck. I have been going<br/>
to Rocky Neck about once a week for a couple of years,<br/>
and yet your directions led me to several beautiful<br/>
spots that I had never been to before!  Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I liked it so much that I went back and <br/>
&gt; planted a letterbox at the end today<br/>
<br/>
That's great!  It will give me a reason to go back<br/>
there to hunt for your box!  Thanks!<br/>
