<br/>
I am sorry to make double work for you.  In my haste to get the clues <br/>
posted before the Mystery Gathering I posted the short clue version <br/>
that does not have driving directions and background.  Could you <br/>
please replace the clues with these updated clues?<br/>
<br/>
thank you very much,<br/>

Ninigret's Take It Easy Letterbox<br/>
Ninigret National Wildlife Refuge<br/>
Charlestown, RI<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Both the hike &amp; clues are easy.  Walk on flat well marked <br/>
trails approximately 2 miles round trip.  This is an excellent <br/>
letterbox to do during hunting season as there is not hunting allowed <br/>
in the refuge.  Bring lots of insect repellent as the mosquitoes and <br/>
ticks can be a problem during certain times of the year.<br/>
<br/>
Background:  Ninigret National Wildlife Refuge is one of five <br/>
national wildlife refuges in Rhode Island.  It consists of 409 acres <br/>
of diverse upland and wetland habitats.  The refuge, formally part of <br/>
the Charlestown Naval Auxiliary landing Field, provides visitors with <br/>
over four miles of hiking trails.  The refuge borders on Rhode <br/>
Island's largest salt pond, Ninigret Pond.  <br/>
<br/>
Driving Directions:  This hike starts at the east entrance to the <br/>
Ninigret National Wildlife Refuge.  From US Rt 1 in Charlestown <br/>
follow signs to the main entrance of Ninigret Park.  Upon entering <br/>
the park continue past the Frosty Drew Nature Center.  Follow signs <br/>
to "refuge parking."<br/>
<br/>
Clues: From the parking area walk south to the information kiosk.   <br/>
Take the trail on your right (when facing the kiosk.)  Shortly you <br/>
will come to a Y in the trail. Head right.  Follow the trail onto a <br/>
dug up runway.  Turn left onto the runway.  The trail soon crosses a <br/>
larger runway.  When you enter the woods on the far side of this <br/>
runway take a right onto the Interior Trail.  You will follow this <br/>
trail for about 1 mile to cross another runway.  When you reenter the <br/>
woods stay straight on the Foster Cove Nature Trail.  Walk until you <br/>
come to a bench overlooking Foster Cove.  This faces west and has a <br/>
beautiful view at sunset.  Follow trail 25 paces beyond the bench to <br/>
see a faint path on your right.  The treasure you seek is behind the <br/>
large tree on the right of this path.  Continue down the trail a <br/>
short way to another runway.  Here is the west parking lot and <br/>
another kiosk.  Turn right and follow the runway trail approx.  mile <br/>
back to your car.<br/>
