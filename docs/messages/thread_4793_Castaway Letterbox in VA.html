Date Placed: 26 March 2002<br/>
Location:  First Landing State Park, Virginia Beach, Virginia<br/>
Difficulty: Easy<br/>
<br/>
Enter First Landing Park from 64th street and park in the first <br/>
wayside parking lot after the contact station.  Cross the paved road <br/>
and start on the Cape Henry Trail.<br/>
<br/>
As you hike the trail take the time to smell the clean air and enjoy <br/>
the beautiful scenery.  As you walk down the trail you should notice <br/>
some impressive nests in the trees to your left.  When you pass mile <br/>
marker 4 heading toward marker 5 you know you're getting closer.  Not <br/>
long after marker 4 you'll come to a spot on the trail where a fallen <br/>
tree had blocked the path.  This tree that once was complete is now <br/>
cleanly two.  From there 27 footfalls will bring you to a small side <br/>
path on the right side of the main trail (marked by a tall and short <br/>
set of evergreens).  Take this path through the bamboo shoots for 31 <br/>
footfalls and enjoy the scene from the crest of the path.  For those <br/>
of you who brought their compass, take a magnetic bearing of 345 <br/>
degrees and land 7 footfalls.  There lies a twisted log and behind <br/>
it, well hidden in pine needles and leaves, is where the friend of <br/>
Chuck the "Castaway" Noland now lies.<br/>
