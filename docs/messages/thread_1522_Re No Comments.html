<br/>
I agree wholeheartedly with your "no comments please" message..I do hope<br/>
it wasn't me musing on the UK systems that caused all this flurry...<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you about skills and abilities viewpoint ..I often can't find<br/>
a box ..and very rarely believe it is missing...Heck that's a huge part of<br/>
the challenge..your US clues seem easy peasy compared with ours but I am<br/>
often "box crazy" when I can't find em...If it were all so easy what would<br/>
be the point ?<br/>
<br/>
But... I do ask the owner though...<br/>
<br/>
In the UK we have mobile phones much more than in the US ..in my sons<br/>
classroom at school there are 30 kids and at least 40 mobes !<br/>
<br/>
So I even call the owner from the (unfound) box if I am in doubt ..Not<br/>
that they always help <grin> <br/>
I do call though esp if the box is wet and or trashed...<br/>
<br/>
The other side of UK boxing is that many boxers do carry a "repair kit" of<br/>
blank new books, zip lock bags, post cards etc and even some empty<br/>
tupperware/pill-boxes to restore cracked or damaged containers ...<br/>
<br/>
..I've never replaced a stamp in a box before though but I liked that<br/>
idea..I could make some "couldn't find it", or "Missing in Action" stamps<br/>
which would be nice idea!<br/>
..but see below..<br/>
<br/>
I still haven't gotten over to your green State yet ..is it really a whole<br/>
year boxing possibility then, no real bad weather times ?<br/>
<br/>
It looks more and more tempting each month on the postings ...maybe next<br/>
year I'll be there..<br/>
<br/>
..and you say <br/>
Finally, I would like to suggest that the most important thing about a <br/>
letterbox is not the box or the stamp or the logbook.  The coolest thing<br/>
is <br/>
that someone has written a set of clues that lead to a private little<br/>
hiding place in the wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
Bravo ..That is what it is all about ..Bravo Encore !<br/>
<br/>
and again you say..<br/>
<br/>
Rather than publish info online about missing boxes, I would rather<br/>
encourage <br/>
this sort of personal communication.<br/>
<br/>
That is exactly what has happened in the UK ..we call em WOM ..word of<br/>
mouth boxers / boxes...<br/>
<br/>
All things go in cycles methinks...you recall I am sure in the very first<br/>
communications when there was only Erics site (even before Daniel's site )<br/>
that UK boxers were saying that keeping the secret is a key<br/>
component...and now as the scale of US boxing has begun to reach good<br/>
levels that secret part of the hobby is becoming more significant...Its<br/>
really about private rather than secret in US speak maybe...but you are<br/>
speaking the truth that spoiling is no fun...Rather hunt and fail that<br/>
just pick up stamps..not to say a "find by chance" isn't cool either !<br/>
<br/>
Oh and finally and CONFIDENTIALLY !..we have a new box wrecker about in<br/>
the UK atm...he has had some cheap stamps made up saying..."You've been<br/>
robbed"..all the same ! , all boring ! and he swaps out your hand mades<br/>
etc..very nasty that imho...I wouldn't advertise this publicly because<br/>
it's not a good idea to "advertise and explain how to be stupid" imho !<br/>
<br/>
Keep on boxing...best wishes <br/>
<br/>

	Wow, your words are exquisite! I sometimes dream of letterboxing at<br/>
Dartmoor. I do hope to get over there sometime within the next year. I feel<br/>
that I must make my letterboxing "Mecca" journey.<br/>
