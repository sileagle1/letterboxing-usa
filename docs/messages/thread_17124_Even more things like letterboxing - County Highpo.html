letterboxing.  Everyone should pick up a cheap GPS and give it a try.<br/>

But maybe you do not know about the County Highpointers!!  These are a<br/>
splinter sub group of the Highpointers Club<br/>
<br/>
see http://highpointers.org/<br/>
<br/>
The County Highpointers have a group discussion here on Yahoo Groups as  <br/>

Basicaly you travel to the highest point in each county.  It is very<br/>
interesting to see the little towns in the area of each county<br/>
highpoint.  Everything is so unique and a small town (many times).<br/>
