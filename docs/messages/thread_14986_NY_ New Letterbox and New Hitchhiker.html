Meetcha Hitchhiker near Swain, NY, Allegany County.  Have fun!<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Born Mikolaj Kopernik in Poland in 1473, Copernicus moved the center <br/>
of the universe. By 1514, Copernicus was already producing small <br/>
booklets which would eventually become his masterwork, De <br/>
Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, published on 1541. It stated that <br/>
the planets revolved around the sun and the Earth was not the center <br/>
of the universe. Though this had been proposed by scientists before <br/>
Copernicus, he was the first one known to correctly explain the <br/>
retrograde motion of the outer planets, forever changing the face of <br/>
science and astronomy.<br/>
<br/>
Terrain: Moderate to difficult. About a mile of hilly, muddy, rocky <br/>
overgrown paths. High whine factor from our five year old.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Hard!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Notes:<br/>
- No ink pad in the box, make sure you bring your own.<br/>
- Although a map is not required for this hike, I recommend getting <br/>
Finger Lakes Trail Conference map M8, which is available here:<br/>
http://www.fingerlakestrail.org<br/>
- As an added incentive for this difficult box, first finder also <br/>
gets the Pleaseta Meetcha Hitchhiker.<br/>
- Please email me with notes about the box: jelybean@stny.rr.com<br/>
