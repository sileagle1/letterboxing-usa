Your right though, it is hard to control yourself once you start. <br/>
<br/>
As soon as we're done letterboxing for the weekend, I'm planning what <br/>
box/boxes to go for the following weekend!<br/>
<br/>
I'm dreading the coming winter. How will I cope without finding a <br/>
letterbox for weeks on end? I'm hoping that creating my first few <br/>
letterboxes, to be planted in the spring, will get me through!<br/>
<br/>
I got it bad huh?<br/>

Box all winter!  I boxed all winter last year, with the exception of about <br/>
two weeks (when we had those 25 inches of snow!).  It does get addicting!<br/>
