address does not work. I was at their Old Man Letterbox in NH and the <br/>
book was full. I took it upon myself to replace the book with a new <br/>
one and I now have the Full Original Letterbox Log in my possession. <br/>
I would like to snail mail it to them, but have not been able to <br/>
contact them!!<br/>
<br/>
It is a neat Log full of great signature stamps! (2 years worth!!)<br/>
