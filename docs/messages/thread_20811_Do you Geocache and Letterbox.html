I have done a few geocache spots in my area, because it is a good <br/>
way to get my young daughter out and hiking, she gets excited <br/>
thinking about trading something of hers for something else. But I <br/>
don't enjoy it, it lacks something for me that letterboxing <br/>
provides. I love everyone's creativity and feel closer to the people <br/>
that letterbox when we e-mail. Maybe because of the time people <br/>
spend on carving and the thought that goes into placing that I <br/>
appreciate letterboxing more. Even if the stamp isn't carved well, I <br/>
still love them and always look at the carve lines etched in the <br/>
stamp and sometimes I am disappointed when I find a storebought <br/>
stamp.<br/>
