<br/>
Clues: Easy<br/>
Terrain: Long hill, but paved most of the way  overall easy.<br/>
Time: 60-90 minutes<br/>
<br/>
Directions: <br/>
 	From Route 2 East, exit 10.  Right onto Manchester Road.  Left at stop<br/>
sign onto New London Turnpike.  At fork, bear right onto Wassuc Road.  At<br/>
next fork, bear left (away from Route 2 signs) and go over Route 2. <br/>
Follow curve around to the right and park at the yellow pole gate.<br/>
 	From Route 2 West, exit 11, Thompson Street.  Right at end of ramp. <br/>
Park at yellow pole gate.<br/>
<br/>
Head east through a big sandy area where you can park if the yellow gate<br/>
is unlocked.  Old Tollgate Road is a paved road going up, up the hill,<br/>
parallel with Route 2.  Continue past the shooting range entrance (on<br/>
your left) and over the top of the paved hill, where you'll see the<br/>
concrete pillars and pad remains of something in this road's history (a<br/>
toll booth maybe?).  The white trail bears left, but you go straight,<br/>
staying parallel with Route 2 all the way.  Down the hill and to the end,<br/>
where there's a boulder in your path.  At this point you'll cross over a<br/>
little streambed, often dry, onto a blue trail, which starts between two<br/>
rocks.  The Dragonfly Dance letterbox is behind the rock on the left,<br/>
nestled down low between the rock and a tree.  Looking back toward the<br/>
way you came, the tadpole pool is a short distance back down the stream,<br/>
to the north of the trail. In the spring, this little pool is FILLED with<br/>
froggy eggs and tadpoles.  In the winter, the long hills are great for<br/>
sledding!<br/>
