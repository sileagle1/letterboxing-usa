I need to buy a whistle.  I keep "meaning" to, but still haven't and that is<br/>

deep in the woods where I am most likely to have trouble (and I can't use<br/>
that darn GPS anyhow!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While I do box alone, I try to limit those trips to short, easy hikes in<br/>
"safer" locations and  have learned to trust my instincts and be much more<br/>
alert to my surroundings-something easy to forget when wandering along<br/>

lead to some dangerous situations.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My reaction was posted to the newboxer list -- I didn't crosspost it here --<br/>
but for me, my reaction came because of the way the original post was<br/>
worded.  Yes, I was a *little* offended at the wording -- it smacked of a<br/>
parent/child relationship.  Being ordered *not* to do something under *any*<br/>
circumstances.  And the person giving the order wasn't my parent, wasn't my<br/>
spouse, and wasn't my boss.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would have been less rude if the poster had just said "Here's<br/>
something that happened to a single boxer the other day, so I'm putting out<br/>
a heads-up to everyone."  There may be some children on the list, but I<br/>
think by far the majority of folks here are adults.  Putting out a warning<br/>
using a current example goes further in my opinion than one adult giving<br/>
another adult an order -- unless maybe they happen to be their boss, spouse,<br/>
or parent -- people that *sometimes* one has to give more leeway to.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I realize that quite possibly, since the person in<br/>
trouble chose to call the poster and the poster was likely upset about the<br/>
person being in trouble with no way for the poster to really assist -- that<br/>
maybe the subject line and post were worded a bit strongly due to the<br/>
poster's emotions at the time.  Which is why I was only a *little* offended.<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
I think it was definitely a good idea to post what happened.  And I don't<br/>
think people necessarily posted because they were offended. I didn't.  I<br/>
posted to explain why I *do* box alone and the precautions I take.  The same<br/>
as I would tell my parents, if they were still alive, and gave me such an<br/>
order.  I'd say "Dad, Mom, I'm 50+ years old now, here's why I box alone and<br/>
here are the precautions I take to be as safe as possible. I love you both."<br/>

My post was made in haste due to the circumstances. Those that know me, know that I would never force my will or dictate to anyone. That's just not me.<br/>

While a certain group of friends [Baker's Dozen] call me The Daddy, I realize that ultimately the decision rests on the individual.<br/>

When I read your post, I read your urgency, not<br/>
rudeness.  Most folks have been around long enough to<br/>
know that you aren't the dictator type.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when my friend's son died in a 3 wheeler<br/>
accident.  He was 10 years old and doing something<br/>
foolish (let's not go off into the wisdom of his<br/>
parents, or 3-wheelers, or anything else - this is<br/>
JUST a comparison) and he lost his life.  It was so<br/>
incredibly frustrating to know that a little caution<br/>
would have changed the whole scenario, and instead we<br/>
buried a little boy on a New Year's Day.  I yelled at<br/>
my kids all day the day it happened, until one of them<br/>
said, "Why are you so mad at us?  We haven't done<br/>
anything wrong!"  When I stepped back, I realized I<br/>
was reacting to the fact that kids in general do<br/>
foolish things and my own kids could just as easily be<br/>
the victims of their own foolishness.  When something<br/>
tragic or potentially tragic happens, you want to<br/>
protect everyone else around you from making a similar<br/>
mistake.  It's natural and normal, and I, for one, was<br/>
glad for the wake up call because I know I could be<br/>
guilty of getting lax.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm glad your friend is okay, and I'm glad you posted<br/>
the message you did.  It's made me, and everyone else,<br/>
think again about our safety when we are out there.<br/>

&gt; When I read your post, I read your urgency, not<br/>
&gt; rudeness.  Most folks have been around long enough to<br/>
&gt; know that you aren't the dictator type.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I remember when my friend's son died in a 3 wheeler<br/>
&gt; accident.  He was 10 years old and doing something<br/>
&gt; foolish (let's not go off into the wisdom of his<br/>
&gt; parents, or 3-wheelers, or anything else - this is<br/>
&gt; JUST a comparison) and he lost his life.  It was so<br/>
&gt; incredibly frustrating to know that a little caution<br/>
&gt; would have changed the whole scenario, and instead we<br/>
&gt; buried a little boy on a New Year's Day.  I yelled at<br/>
&gt; my kids all day the day it happened, until one of them<br/>
&gt; said, "Why are you so mad at us?  We haven't done<br/>
&gt; anything wrong!"  When I stepped back, I realized I<br/>
&gt; was reacting to the fact that kids in general do<br/>
&gt; foolish things and my own kids could just as easily be<br/>
&gt; the victims of their own foolishness.  When something<br/>
&gt; tragic or potentially tragic happens, you want to<br/>
&gt; protect everyone else around you from making a similar<br/>
&gt; mistake.  It's natural and normal, and I, for one, was<br/>
&gt; glad for the wake up call because I know I could be<br/>
&gt; guilty of getting lax.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm glad your friend is okay, and I'm glad you posted<br/>
&gt; the message you did.  It's made me, and everyone else,<br/>
&gt; think again about our safety when we are out there.<br/>
