Did Choi or somebody change something on letterboxing.org or was the <br/>

I hate not getting the joke. <br/>
Almost as much as asking for the joke to be explained to me.<br/>

Later I went into LBNA to look up some clues and saw that my login name was backwards.  My guess is that a moderator made the subtle change.  I believe some of the posts were pranks as well...<br/>
<br/>
  Just wanted to wink at whoever did it.  Very entertaining...<br/>

  Thanks and Enjoy!<br/>
