Clan Jiggs made another foray into Tilden Park in Berkeley (spelled <br/>
it right this time!!) and can report on the following...<br/>
<br/>
Haunted Carousel - in fine shape and well-visited - book just about <br/>
full though.<br/>
<br/>
Pony Ride - also in good shape!<br/>
<br/>
Wildcat Summit #2 (Peace Grove) - nice hike! Box was fine, if a <br/>
little soggy (book was new - replaced?)<br/>
<br/>
Wildcat Summit #3 (LUD) - trail was soggy but passable (and miserably <br/>
muddy to reclimb!!) box was a little damp, but readable. First <br/>
vistors since July!!)<br/>
<br/>
Wildcat Summit #1 - will remain a mystery as time (and daylight) were <br/>
in very short supply.<br/>

We tried for the Wildcat boxes last Sunday too but had to cut our <br/>
trip short. My little letterboxing buddy, Sako, wanted out of the <br/>
stroller after seeing all the other kids on the path. But as soon as <br/>
we unbuckled the straps she took off running down the trail, tripped <br/>
and split her lip open. Her dad had to carry a full mile back to the <br/>
car with her tears streaming and blood gooshing.<br/>
<br/>
Well...guess I'll just have to try again another day. Maybe when the <br/>
trails aren't so muddy too<br/>
<br/>
how about a purple heart for my little girl? She's got a pretty good <br/>
purple lip going to match.<br/>
