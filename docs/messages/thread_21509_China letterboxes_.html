Just wondering...we're putting together plans for a 'pleasure' trip <br/>
to China in a couple of weeks and were only jokingly considering <br/>
planting a letterbox there.  Then, curiousity sent me over to the <br/>
geocaching website 'just to see' and lo &amp; behold there were dozens <br/>
of 'real live non-virtual' caches there.  Who knew?  Now, can I <br/>
rustle up enough courage to plant a letterbox in China or not?  <br/>
(there are some underlying personal reasons why doing so wouldn't be <br/>
the smartest thing for me to do--but perhaps an alter-ego can plant <br/>
one there with our gentle behooving???)  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, does anybody know of any China LBs by any chance?<br/>
