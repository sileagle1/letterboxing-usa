                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many thanks to all who have been posting letterboxes! We web hosts <br/>
for LbNA are very excited to see the positive spirit and the growth <br/>
in this wonderful pastime. Everyone has been great about posting <br/>
boxes with the info that makes our lives easier and we truly <br/>
appreciate it. The LbNA links and courtesy cluepages are done the old <br/>
fashioned way, by hand, one at a time, by volunteers: anticipating <br/>
ever-increasing quantities of letterboxes with spring, I hope you <br/>
don't mind if I mention some reminders of what helps us get your <br/>
letterboxes posted from the yahoogroup to the LbNA links pages: these <br/>
are not meant to be didactic "do it our way" rules, but rather <br/>
suggestions for what helps us help you. Some letterboxes with more <br/>
mysterious natures won't fit this little model and any letterboxer <br/>
can always post any way they desire. We're totally open to new ideas, <br/>
so if you've got one, please let everyone know.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that helps the most is having everything all up <br/>
front in the post: please consider putting the state name in the <br/>
subject line of your email, and then open it up with something like:<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox Name: "No War on Iraq"<br/>
Placed by: The Peaceful 'Boxers<br/>
Number of boxes: 2<br/>
Date: March 14, 2003<br/>
City: Cincinnati<br/>
County: Washington<br/>
State: OH<br/>
LbNA regional page URL:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/oh/midwest.htm<br/>
My webpage URL:<br/>
http://peacefulboxers/geocities.com<br/>
Clues as follows: take a left at the Peace Memorial and walk...<br/>
<br/>
For Mystery clues, give us as much or as little as you want people to <br/>
know: they will show up either on the state or the national mystery <br/>
pages depending on how you instruct us.<br/>
<br/>
Another format that we can easily work with goes something like "on <br/>
Feb 14th WasabiGal planted the Spicy Sushi letterbox in Florence, <br/>
Pinal County, AZ."<br/>
<br/>
We're working on a new automated website design that will let you <br/>
post and update your own letterboxes without having to wait for a web <br/>
manager to do it for you (a-la geocaching.com and bookcrossing.com). <br/>
Hopefully this new system will be up for test runs soon. Since we're <br/>
firmly committed to a dot-org, noncommercial venture, this is taking <br/>
a while and not nearly as sophisticated as those more professional <br/>
websites. Still, we're pretty proud of it and looking forward to a <br/>
grand opening. Maybe we should make the site a virtual mystery box at <br/>
first.<br/>
<br/>
One of the less-often-used tidbits folks add in their clues are the <br/>
regional page it should go on at LbNA. It's never been hard in the <br/>
past for us webmasters to remember what goes where, but with the <br/>
amazing growth in letterbox plantings this year it's getting harder, <br/>
for me at least, to remember these things. Letting us know which TX <br/>
page your clues should land on is a huge help.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, if you have one of the personalized pages at LbNA <br/>
(i.e., "Squirrel's, VA Letterboxes") please mention that the new clue <br/>
should go there, as opposed to getting it's own separate cluepage, <br/>
and give us your pages' name/url.<br/>
<br/>
Having your own outside webpages that we can link to is heaven for <br/>
us: if you're not comfortable with creating and uploading them, check <br/>
out the Random Acts of Letterboxing Kindness page at<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/raolk/raolk.htm<br/>
<br/>
to find a volunteer who'll help out. If you are using RAOLK <br/>
volunteers, it's a big help if you post the clues directly to them <br/>
first, so that they can post the yahoogroup with the clues and your <br/>
webpages, the way the Psycho Kiwis do for Leader of the Pack. That <br/>
way we don't have to do those links twice.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like to include your own email address in your clues so <br/>
Finders can contact you, please type your email address in with <br/>
spaces (i.e., drewclan at aol.com). None of the LbNA web hosts are <br/>
yahoogroup moderators, which means that we cannot see your complete <br/>
email address. Cluesheets often get posted with the useless <br/>
yahoogroup truncation "drewclan@a..." in the text. Dot dot dot just <br/>
doesn't connect...<br/>
<br/>
"Attachments" to email overwhelmed us with virus problems. We <br/>
discourage them whenever possible but of course there may be reasons <br/>
people would want to use them (like for graphics or formatting). So <br/>
if you must, please send them directly to webmasters@letterboxing.org.<br/>
<br/>
You can track the amazing growth in  letterbox plantings each month <br/>

Thanks so much for your patience with this overly-long posting (hint: <br/>
there are no mystery letterbox clues imbedded....this time).<br/>

Which considering all the other inept security in the yahoo system, it<br/>
amazes me that they bother to do this ...<br/>
<br/>
In any case, this reminds me that I meant to make Jay a moderator a <br/>
while back and it got lost in the shuffle.<br/>
<br/>
One request to add to Jay's post ... if you need to send mail to the<br/>
webmasters along the lines of: why isn't my clue on the website? or,<br/>
I forgot the county or there are these spelling errors, please send this<br/>
directly to the webmasters.  OTOH, if your post along these lines is<br/>
about a substantitive typo in the clues, like the bearing should be "east",<br/>
not "west" (or the spelling errors matter ;-)), please send these to the <br/>
list.  <br/>
<br/>
The idea is -- if the error will give the hunter grief, send it to the<br/>
list; if its cosmetic, send to to whomever is hosting (or should be)<br/>
your clues.  There are many more of these types of messages than I <br/>
think people are interested in, IMHO.<br/>
