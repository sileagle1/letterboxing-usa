Since so many people seem to be celebrating letterboxing <br/>
anniversaries or milestones lately, I figured we might as well join <br/>
the crowd.  Yesterday we celebrated our 2nd letterboxing <br/>
anniversary with over 2000 found boxes for Wanda and over <br/>
1500 for myself! (Not bad for two years of letterboxing, right?) To <br/>
be sure, Wanda and I had stumbled upon quests/letterboxes <br/>
earlier on separate hiking trips to VT and CT, but somehow back <br/>
then I just couldn't seem to get Wanda interested in looking for <br/>
tupperware containers on little local walks that she had already <br/>
done many times.  I finally managed to find out about a box in a <br/>
place she hadn't been to before, but wouldn't you know she got a <br/>
bad case of poison ivy there, and that set the interest level back <br/>
for another long interval.  It wasn't until I discovered the talklist in <br/>
January of 2001, found out about the Tolland Winter Gathering <br/>
that year on "Super Letterboxing Sunday", met the nice folks <br/>
there (Carolyn, Alan from Axtown, See Joy,etc), caught the buzz <br/>
about mysteries like "Summer Music" that we hadn't heard of <br/>
before, and added the challenge of trying to find the boxes under <br/>
lots of snow that we then became "hooked" on the hobby!<br/>
<br/>
The rest is history.  Every available day after that we were off to <br/>
look for boxes.  Those first few months were really snowy, so we <br/>
got to ski up things we normally wouldn't have been able to (like <br/>
rocky Mt Misery), and then often couldn't find the boxes under the <br/>
snow when we got there, but still had a blast trying, and still <br/>
managed to find literally hundreds of boxes anyway in just a <br/>
couple of months (and that at a time before many of the quick <br/>
series and drive-ups currently available!)  By the time spring <br/>
rolled along, Wanda was off again for her "serious hiking" (AT <br/>
#5, etc.), but still managed to find time for some of the boxes <br/>
planted near her planned trail routes.  By the end of that first year <br/>
we had each worked hard to find nearly 800 boxes and thought <br/>
our interest in the hobby might go the route of last winter's snow, <br/>
but - no - legerdemaine and mapsurfer mysteries served to <br/>
spark our second winter's letterbox fascination and got us <br/>
through that next snowless winter.  By our second spring, boxes <br/>
were cropping up everywhere around us by the dozens it <br/>
seemed, so picking up a bunch at a time was no longer such a <br/>
novelty.  However, even if you call this past year's bounty "easy <br/>
pickin's" (which certainly not all of them were!), the sheer effort of <br/>
collecting over 1200 boxes in one year is still a remarkable feat, <br/>
so I wanted to plant a special box to commemorate Wanda's <br/>
achievement (2000 boxes in 2 years!), and also to honor our 2 <br/>
sweet cats, Choolie and Ondra (Ciuleandra). I'll try to get the <br/>
clues for that and the Favorite Ornaments (including a new <br/>
surprise from Michigan!) added to our web page soon.  For now, <br/>
congratulations, Wanda, and I'd also like to think that letterboxing <br/>
may have helped to keep you happy closer to home these past 2 <br/>
years than you might otherwise have been!<br/>
<br/>

Congratulations, guys!  Keep it up and I'm sure you will forever <br/>

Does anyone know what the Dartmoor record is for most boxes found?  <br/>
Maybe W&amp;P even have a shot at the world record!<br/>

<br/>
The Dartmoor 100 Club has more than 12,800 members, according to the <br/>
"official" Dartmoor letterboxing site (http://walk.to/letterboxing/). They <br/>
have merit badges for finding 100, 200 and 500 boxes, and more elaborate <br/>
badges for those who have visited 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 &amp; 4,000 different <br/>
boxes. It doesn't stop there -- they have a "rather special" badge for <br/>
people who find 5,000 boxes!<br/>

Congratulations! Heck, we're just honored to have seen your stamps and names in 3 of the letterboxes we got last fall when we traveled to RI and CT. Our stamps were right next to yours on the same days--it's a wonder we weren't able to "X"!<br/>
