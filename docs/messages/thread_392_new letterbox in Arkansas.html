<div>Well our trip to Arkansas was successful except 
we got rained out last Sunday.  We had two teenagers with us that we 
totally exhausted on the Hemmed in Hollow hike.  So with the rain and the 
winey kids we headed back to Springfield for of course the Bass Pro shop (guys) 
and Battlefield Mall (gals).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On Saturday we did set out Arkansas' first 
letterbox (March 27)  the location was</div>
<div>Hemmed in Hollow, a boxed in canyon with a 175 
ft waterfall.  It was officially placed</div>
<div>by my teenagers Andrea (16) and Kyle 
(13).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Trail from Compton and hwy 43 was in excellent 
condition and recommended.</div>
<div>Hiking down to the falls was easy but difficult 
and exhausting saving yourself back out (all uphill, few level or downhill 
surfaces).  It is a 2.8 miles oneway hike.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To record into our Websitie the map and clues 
please use the following....</div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="http://www.ozarkmountainvacation.com/trailsmap.htm">www.ozarkmountainvacation.com/trailsmap.htm</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>terrain: good trail from hwy 43 or from river 
via float.  </div>
<div>difficulty:  must be in good phyiscal 
condition allow four hours ....extreme.</div>
<div>recommend float and hike to falls but it easy to 
miss trail from water, no sign</div>
<div> </div>
<div>accessibility: land or water, three trails 
available via Compton on Hwy 43 (blink and you'll miss it!), three mile hike 
from either Steel Creek or Kyle's landing (longer but easier if you're less in 
conditioning). </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Clues:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All trails lead to box inside the canyon.  
Obvious resting or lunch rock (flat) is your starting point at the falls.  
With falls being magnetic north on the lunch rock, spin 160 degrees relative, up 
hill within 20 paces is a HUGE rock pited with water holes.  Atop is a 
medium tree with hole at base.  Remove cover from hole and box is 
inside.  PLEASE look for critters first before reaching.  Probe with 
stick if you like.  Please replace box and cover as previous found.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>NOTE:  This is a very public place and it 
is unlikely you will have the area to yourself.  So please be discrete to 
your activity, you may have an audience.</div>
<div>Enjoy the hand carved stamp as it will dictate 
Hemmed in Hollow, a well earned</div>
<div>stamping!  Best regards and happy 
letterboxing!  Greg, Ginny, Andrea and Kyle</div>

Nice map, challenging letterbox hunt!  Way to go Greg, Ginny and kids.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's 20 down, 30 to go for 50 by Y2K.  Technically we could<br/>
call it 22 down and 28 to go as technically New York and North<br/>
Carolina do have letterboxes, they just show up on bordering<br/>
state's maps right now.<br/>
