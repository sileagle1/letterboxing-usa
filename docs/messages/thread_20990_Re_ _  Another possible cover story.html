What a well written fungi laden tale! I truly did encounter some <br/>
mushroom hunters one  day while hiking to a local hitchhiker hostel. <br/>
An older couple accompanied by their dog (perhaps it was an incognito <br/>
pig) came merrily traipsing down the hill.  "Mrs." carried 2 huge <br/>
glorious mushrooms, shaped rather like elves umbrellas. aloft in each <br/>
hand. If they were indeed letterboxers I was totally convinced of the <br/>
varacity of their innocent fungi hunting  actions and missed an <br/>
exchange on the trail.<br/>
