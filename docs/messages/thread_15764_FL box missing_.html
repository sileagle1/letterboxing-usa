We went out today looking for them and found no trace of them. Three <br/>
hours we hiked and looked and back tracked to make sure we had the <br/>
correct spots.  There is no doubt that we did.  But no boxes :(  My <br/>
two partners (4 &amp; 9) were dissapointed.  However if no one has found <br/>
them, I thought we would place new boxes with the old clues.  Hope <br/>
everyone is having a good weekend finding LBs.<br/>
<br/>
:)<br/>
Thanks<br/>
