                    <div class="plaintext-content">Found the Down Under Series yesterday in Wayne, NJ [my hometown].  Very nice <br/>
hike, some beautiful views of the putrid brown New Jerey air from the summit <br/>
of High Mountain [which isn't high at all at a walloping 850'].  Some of the <br/>
worst bugs I've ever seen in my entire life on the "white trail" section.  <br/>
It's in a valley, we've been receiving lots and lots [too much] of rain and <br/>
I was killing about 10 misquitos per minute!  Anyway all of the boxes are <br/>
intact and doing fine, except I couldn't find the Emu box.  Hell short of <br/>
that, I couldn't even find the tree that has "Art is Beautiful 4Ever" carved <br/>
into it!  So I'm gonna have to go back and try to find it again.  Oh well.<br/>
