<br/>
I am making T-shirts and Sweatshirts with the event stamp image on them for the Mansfield Monster Mash Gathering!<br/>
<br/>
The prices will be $10.00 for the t-shirt and $15.00 for the sweatshirt.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to place an advance order for one you will need to email me off list with your name, shirt style and size.  You may pay me at the event when you pick up your shirt.  <br/>
<br/>
If you order a shirt and find you are unable to make the event please email me ASAP in advance to let me know so that I can either not make yours or you can mail me payment plus an additional $5.00 for shipping!<br/>
<br/>
We will also have a few hand made hiking sticks available for $15.00.  There are a limited number of these so if you'd like one you can let me know that also.  If you are not there to pay and pick it up by 5:00 pm it will be sold to someone else.  These can NOT be shipped.  If you miss out we will have more in the spring.<br/>
<br/>
See you all in 3 weeks!<br/>
<br/>
