It's pretty thick, so I'm thinking I can have twice as much carving material if <br/>

  We cut our Mastercarve block in half using a butcher knife...but I'm <br/>
  sure someone has a better idea...  It came out alright though, <br/>
  despite the knife needing to be sharpened.<br/>

I used my cheese slicer for cutting the Mastercarve block in half and <br/>
it worked. Cuts like butter!<br/>

What about a bagel slicer?  I have a handy one where the bagel sits <br/>
in a bit of a craddle and there's a large blade (like a guillotine) <br/>
that you push through the bagel to slice it in half.  It might be <br/>
more rugged and cut through the block a bit better than a cheese <br/>
slicer.<br/>
