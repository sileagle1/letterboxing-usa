Oh Boy!  Oh Boy!  Oh Boy!  We can't wait!  11 boxes will certainly set us on <br/>
the way to 200F!  Sometimes it is nice when they are in different parks <br/>
because, as you said, you can tackle them a couple at a time.  This is <br/>
easier with little ones who don't have the stamina (or attention span) to do <br/>
too many boxes at once.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I would say that if you have to DRIVE from one box to the next, you<br/>
&gt; &gt; should post them as separate boxes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; From what I can tell, series are usually listed as boxes where<br/>
&gt; &gt; you can hike from box to box.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Can anyone think of an exception?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;You're right, usually when you see series, they are all in one park.<br/>
&gt;But I have a series of 3 boxes in VA called In The Park that is in 3<br/>
&gt;neighborhood parks within about a 1 sq mile area.  The clues have<br/>
&gt;directions on how to drive from one park to the next.  Anyone reading<br/>
&gt;the clues can see that the boxes can be done in a different order.  I<br/>
&gt;have a big series of 11 boxes coming up (if I ever get the initiative<br/>
&gt;to actually place the darn things) that will be in a bunch of<br/>
&gt;different parks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, I'd say you could post them either way - as a series or as<br/>
&gt;individual boxes.<br/>
