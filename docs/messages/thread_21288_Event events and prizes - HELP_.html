Can anyone give me some ideas for making an event more interesting, i.e. drawings, raffles, types of demonstrations/classes, etc.  What about prizes and give-aways?  What are some fun items for this?  HELP!!!<br/>

I have always found that the social aspects of an event were the biggest draw for me. <br/>
I don't feel the need for much of anything else. However, some gatherings feature all <br/>

I would agree with Funhog -- the social aspect is the biggest draw <br/>
for me and the opportunity to do a little boxing at a place I may not <br/>
have otherwise been to.  Event boxes and time for folks to seek them <br/>
are also a primary draw -- perhaps you could place a few little <br/>
goodies inside some of them (i.e. coupons, etc.) or make up a game or <br/>
some kind of a riddle for finding the boxes (i.e. kind of like a <br/>
scanvenger hunt) if you are looking for something more than routine.<br/>
<br/>
Too much stuff going on can be overwhelming and chaotic, especially <br/>
once you get a couple dozen people attending.  In general people want <br/>
time to visit and exchange stamps with one another and do some <br/>
boxing.  Workshops are nice and at the events I have attended, they <br/>
have always been well received.  At the first Great Lakes Gathering, <br/>
one of the attendees did a workshop on micro/urban letterboxes.  This <br/>
was really fun because it was out of the ordinary.<br/>

I'm only there for the Pepe gossip. (just kidding)<br/>
Actually, I really enjoy seeing other people's stamps, and visiting a<br/>
new area. I'm not fond of large gatherings and after a while, I shirk<br/>
away from exchanging. <br/>
<br/>
One very big no-no at a gathering (IMHO) is running up to someone and<br/>
shouting the question/answer/number to their personal traveler in<br/>
their face as if... <br/>
<br/>
my most favorite gathering experience hands down was this fall's<br/>
mystery gathering. Nice. Good location, nice small crowd, and nice<br/>
time of the year despite the drizzlies. Good planning and company all<br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, I'd personally like to see less emphasis on the hoards<br/>
of boxes at events. It puts some folks on the spot to produce ten<br/>
million event stamps. not really cool in my book. <br/>
<br/>
Just meeting folks and enjoying the day is quite enough for moi.<br/>

<br/>
Number Uno:<br/>
Location location location<br/>
<br/>
Need I really say more?<br/>
<br/>
They element of an un-stated "mystery" gathering was divine. Really,<br/>
it is quite tantalizing. I enjoyed the excitement leading up to the<br/>
gathering, the clue hints posted to the talk list. Just plain fun!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, the stamps that were carved related to the location. I<br/>
enjoyed that very much, and the historical elements incorporated into<br/>
the seasonal gathering.  Well done!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the intrigue of just "who" might attend. In the northeastern<br/>
states, I always have to wonder if Legerdemaine is amongst. <br/>

We made a super sized stamp out of styrofoam, coated it with some <br/>
stenciling ink and stamped some tee shirts with a very large LBNA <br/>
logo. Sierra Sally was one of the only courageous letterboxers to <br/>
recieve the stamp.<br/>

&gt; So can you say what about the planning<br/>

&gt; (Thus speaketh someone who's planning <br/>
&gt; a gathering in two weeks!)<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the tips mentioned (location, small crowd, good <br/>
season) I'd like to add a tip or two to help the planning part of it <br/>
go well. These are things I wish I had done right when planning a <br/>
largish gathering (and remember, even if you plan for it to be a <br/>
small gathering, it can and probably will grow huge without much <br/>
effort).<br/>
<br/>
* Figure out how long each item on the "schedule" ought to take, then <br/>
multiply by 3. That's how long it will actually take. Then throw away <br/>
the schedule. Who wants to look at their watches?<br/>
* Look at your list of "scheduled" items, and remove half of them. No <br/>
one will have time to do all of them, and if they try it'll just make <br/>
the mood frantic (and not the casual, laid-back get-together that <br/>
everyone really loves). If you're really adventurous, remove all of <br/>
the "scheduled" items and just let things happen spontaneously. This <br/>
actually works very well! <br/>
* Load the car the night before. Try not to do anything else that <br/>
evening and get lots of sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Wish I could be there!<br/>
