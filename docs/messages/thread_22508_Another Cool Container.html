I just got the coolest containers!  At a recent fund raiser, someone <br/>
had brought Country Time Lemonade drink mix.  We used two containers up <br/>
and I took them home.  They have screw on lids, plastic and once I <br/>
covered them with camo duct tape, they are the coolest!  They will hold <br/>
everything - even a large stamp.  Now I just have to get carving.<br/>
<br/>
I really like to find unusual containers - on one of my plants I have <br/>
containers shaped like dog bones and another has a bejeweled stamp <br/>
box.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else got into unusal containers?  What fun things have you <br/>
found?<br/>
