                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just placed a letterbox in Minnesota to mark the<br/>
mysterious 45th Parallel. I'd like to make a series of<br/>
letterboxes for other locations along the 45th<br/>
parallel, and I'm wondering if anyone else would like<br/>
to collaborate on the project. The imagininary line<br/>
runs all the way from Lincoln City, Oregon, across the<br/>
Idaho panhandle, the northern border of Yellowstone,<br/>
through the Twin Cities, Door County, Traverse City,<br/>
the nothern border of Vermont, to Perry, Maine and<br/>
back into the ocean. (And of course, it also crosses<br/>
France, Italy, Romania, Mongolia and the northern part<br/>
of Japan, to name just a few places.) Far too much<br/>
territory for me to travel in search of good letterbox<br/>
locations. <br/>
<br/>
But maybe you know of a good hiding place near this<br/>
line. I'm mostly interested in hiding boxes which make<br/>
some reference to the many interesting historical<br/>
markers and monuments placed to mark the 45th<br/>
Parallel. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone would be willing to collaborate on this<br/>
project, I will provide you with a unique rubber stamp<br/>
(which will tie the whole series together) and various<br/>
other materials about the 45th Parallel to include in<br/>
the box. You will have to find a good hiding spot,<br/>
provide the logbook and box, and write the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Please write to me off-list if you are interested. <br/>

I know there's a sign along I-5 in Salem saying "You are now halfway <br/>
between the equator and the north pole".  And I've been to Lincoln <br/>
City before.  So my hiding boxes out there is a distinct possibility.<br/>
<br/>
However, right NOW I'm wondering around Central America (near the <br/>
15th parallel) and it's not very practical.  Maybe later in the year <br/>
when I return to Oregon, though.<br/>
