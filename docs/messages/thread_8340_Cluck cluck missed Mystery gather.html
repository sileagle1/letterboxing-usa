                    <html><body>We missed you too Carolyn!  Even though it was raining all day, it was a great day!  I  was able to pick up approx. 35 exchanges and about six boxes, including the Dancing Men!!!!!  I'm hoping to go back to Ninigret tomorrow to finish up on the boxes there.....  we wanted to get to Dancing Men before dark!!  We may get back to DM tomorrow to get the Pine Barrens stamp, since the daylight didn't last!  Chuck and Chickabirdie went with us for DM, since they were also on the right trail with the clues.  What a great day indeed!!!!!
