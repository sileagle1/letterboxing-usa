&gt; Hi --<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I checked out your home page and realized, when I saw the picture of you<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; Coyote, that I'd met you at Dog Scout Camp the past two summers. Your<br/>
article<br/>
&gt; in the Dog Scout newsletter and your replies to me when I started trying<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; place boxes as well as the activities with my own D.S. Troop 108 certainly<br/>
&gt; have been a help to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I really like your stamps -- and hope that I can develop my own skills so<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; to make some that are comparable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope I'll see you at Scout camp in June.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Grace (Triscuit is my Golden Retriever who comes with me.)<br/>
