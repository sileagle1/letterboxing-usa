Oak" letterbox in the Burr Oak Conservation Area in Blue Springs, MO.<br/>
 The box was in good shape with several stamp-ins.<br/>
<br/>
The online clues at letterboxing.org seem to have an error, though,<br/>
and others made note of it in the letterbox logbook.  The final clue<br/>
sending people looking for a oak tree-V to the SW should really read SE.<br/>
<br/>
I am stubborn and didn't want to look on the opposite side of the<br/>
trail, but by wife insisted and my son found it.<br/>
<br/>
Mmm... humble pie. :)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, we didn't have time to seek any other Burr Oak LBs, but<br/>
we really enjoyed seeing the rock formations, old pioneer house<br/>
foundations, etc, on the Bethany Falls trail.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the hide!<br/>
