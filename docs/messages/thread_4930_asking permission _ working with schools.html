<br/>
We have three publications--beyond the Quest book--<br/>
which might help you.<br/>
<br/>
The Cemetery Quest is a series of eight lessons which<br/>
focuses on mapping small community cemeteries &amp; making<br/>
Quests as a method of teaching local history.<br/>
<br/>
The Village Quest is a series of eight lessons which uses<br/>
historic maps and on-site drawing &amp; investigation to teach about the<br/>
"lost pedestrian villages" hidden within our communities--<br/>
settlements that may have included features like one room<br/>
school houses, churchs, cemeteries, blacksmith shops, mills.<br/>
<br/>
The Valley Quest teacher's guide focuses on making Treasure<br/>
Hunts as part of a year-long curriculum exploring a community's<br/>
sense of place.<br/>
<br/>
The first two are appropriate for 4th - 8th grade.<br/>
The latter best suited for elementary teachers.<br/>
<br/>
The first two are $8 plus postage ($10 total)<br/>
The latter is $10 plus postage ($12 total)<br/>
<br/>
They are available by sending a check made out to<br/>

I had to introduce several park, DEP and State Forest ,and Army corp <br/>
Engineers Reps to letterboxing the othernight. I sure was nervous <br/>
about leaving the right impression.<br/>
<br/>
Carolyn, <br/>
 You are so brave!! I wanted to ask for suggestions on who to ask<br/>
for permission. Our 5th graders at Salem have been working with the Old<br/>
State House to learn about their town. As a culminating activity for<br/>
the program, each child needs to come up with a project to show students<br/>
in Canterbury and Brooklyn, as well as other Salem students some aspect<br/>
of Salem history. The students are free to do absolutely anything<br/>
creative they come up with, so I through out the letterboxing idea to<br/>
one of our social studies teachers. I showed her the Valley Quest book<br/>
and explained how it all worked. She thought it was a fantastic idea,<br/>
and thought it would be really neat if our students could make their own<br/>
mini-quest book.<br/>
 I introduced the idea to two of the classes today and got quite a<br/>
list of interested students. We have found several places, such as old<br/>
buildings, historic cemeteries, and parks that we would like to use, but<br/>
I would like to get permission to hide the box there before we get too<br/>
far. So, my question for you is, who would you go to to ask permission<br/>
to place a box in an historic cemetery, or on town land?<br/>
 I am planning on using some of your ideas for convincing them as<br/>
well as the educational benefits given in the Valley Quest teacher's<br/>
guide. <br/>
 Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you,<br/>
 Melissa<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Trish and Butterfly are planning another vacation hike for April<br/>
break. We are going to Fisherville Brook in Exeter RI on Thursday April<br/>
18th around 10 if you and Timmy are interested. If we do both sides, we<br/>
will be able to find 6 boxes. Hope you can make it.<br/>
