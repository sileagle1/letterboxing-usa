<br/>
Clear (or otherwise) nail polish might help protect some of the exposed <br/>
edges of the metal, or maybe epoxy spray paint might be worth a try if you <br/>
want to cover the entire surface.<br/>
<br/>
A certain amount of rust is probably inevitable, for instance near the <br/>
hinge where there's no good way to seal the metal or where friction will <br/>
eventually wear away the paint, such as where the lid closes.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Sucrets now come in a plastic case that's about the same size as an <br/>
altoid tin. It's not likely watertight, but it's probably no worse than an <br/>
Altoids tin.<br/>

If your tin has rust already I would start with a fresh one and DO NOT was <br/>
anything metal in bleach. The bleach corrodes the tin immediately and you <br/>
won't be able to stop the rust.<br/>
I think a good washing with dishsoap is probably enough. Then try some sort <br/>
of clear coating, like clear nail polish, to avoid future rust.<br/>
