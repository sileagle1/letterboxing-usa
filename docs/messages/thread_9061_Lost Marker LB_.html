The rocks were still around the base of the tree. There are more there now. The tree is not a huge oak but medium or a bit on the small size. It's about a foot or so off the path. The rocks are not huge either but a size that can be carried. It does stand out more now. Good luck the next time you try it.....Chuck and Molly
