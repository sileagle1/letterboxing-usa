today.  The Barb of the Hook was in good shape; the Buggy Box was very wet <br/>
inside, though the stamp and log were dry in their baggies. The baggy with <br/>
the "About Letterboxing" pages was outside the box, though, and the pages <br/>
were soaked throughout and unsalvageable, so I removed the soggy mess entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Both had hitchhikers, which I'll be dropping off in the next couple of weeks.<br/>
