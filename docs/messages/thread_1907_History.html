"from: "Eric J. Eurto"  To: Letterbox Egroup 6 Jan 2001 ...I was thinking<br/>
just now. We have the history or at least how letterboxing began in<br/>
Dartmoor, England. Eric J. Eurto AKA ~The Ram~"<br/>
<br/>
actually the Smithsonian article was a little vague. I wonder if the name<br/>
of the original Dartmoor challenger is known?  When exactly? Comments<br/>

<br/>
" Perhaps we should document the history of how it began in the United<br/>
States?"<br/>
<br/>
 A digest of the posts would give a fair documentation of much of it.<br/>
What number now 4 or 5 thousand someting?<br/>
	When the Smithsonian article came out I was immediately intrigued. I<br/>
emailed the magazine and received a reply that there was already an<br/>
internet link. I thought I must be really slow because no matter how I<br/>
tried that link all I got were errors. I came back to the bookmark after<br/>
a year finally actually connected to a web page. However, all my attempts<br/>
to connect to the group seemed to fail. It was very frustrating, so I<br/>
vented and sure enough got a reply right away! So I guess the moral for<br/>
me was 1. be polite, 2. stick to it. <br/>
	I have not been disappointed. I have stamps from Illinois, Oregon,<br/>
Michigan,  and attempts in Minnesota, Wisconsion, and I keep thinking<br/>
about the ??? in Ohio!. My travels do not yet take me east, heavy sigh,<br/>
someday....<br/>

Last year I wrote an article on Letterboxing, which you can read on <br/>
my Web site. It provides the name of the first <br/>
Dartmoor "Letterboxer," and other information that the Smithsonion <br/>
article did not.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the email...I replied to the January posting at the time by<br/>
talking about some new stamps that I was drafting for a history of US<br/>
letterboxing...I also had some off-list chats to Susan and The Drews  etc !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;"from: "Eric J. Eurto"  To: Letterbox Egroup 6 Jan 2001 ...I was thinking<br/>
&gt;just now. We have the history or at least how letterboxing began in<br/>
&gt;Dartmoor, England. Eric J. Eurto AKA ~The Ram~"<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;actually the Smithsonian article was a little vague. I wonder if the name<br/>
&gt;of the original Dartmoor challenger is known?  When exactly? Comments<br/>
&gt;Graham?<br/>
<br/>
The story of Dartmoor Letterboxing beginnings is very well known...and the<br/>
names of the early letterboxers looks like a "who's who" in literature,<br/>
the arts and aristocracy ..Including Charles Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle,<br/>
and The Prince of Wales (Later to marry Wallace Simpson abdicate the<br/>
throne and become the "Duke of Windsor" in exile in Paris and never again<br/>
to return to Dartmoor)<br/>
<br/>
Conan Doyle even describes Letterboxing in "The Hound of the<br/>
Baskervilles".....<br/>
<br/>
Only last year I was privileged to both exchange emails, and meet up with<br/>
one of the latest and equally venerated visitors to Dartmoor...Judi (Space<br/>
Traveller ) Space.<br/>
<br/>
I must say that I met up with Judi and her partner Mike not on Dartmoor<br/>
but in the comfort of a London bookshop cafe.<br/>
<br/>
Space Traveller is an active LbNA member from Pennsylvania and was at the<br/>
last US meet..Check out the photos on the LbNA site !!.<br/>
<br/>
She has placed a box in a wonderfully evocative site which is also roughly<br/>
where Sherlock Holmes was placing his Letterboxes on Dartmoor..though they<br/>
were for Dr Watson only of course ! <br/>
<br/>
Even Judi doesn't know it yet, I'm sure, but her box has just this week<br/>
appeared in our own British Dartmoor catalogue update ! (yesterday<br/>
actually ie 13/02/2001).<br/>
<br/>
It will appear in print in book form with all the other extant Dartmoor<br/>
boxes on 25 March 2001...(that's clock change day for us !)  Place your<br/>
orders now <grin>!!<br/>
<br/>
You'll notice that we don't use all this hi-tech web based stuff. <lol> <br/>
Obviously we can't get the quality of web-mastering that you have in LbNA<br/>
land !  And, well, we like to be quaint...  hiking along with a nice fat<br/>
letterboxers "bible" in your pocket has a nice solid feel to it ... The<br/>
"lap-top" with the mobile phone modem link, seems a bit out of place on<br/>
the moor imho <big grin=""><br/>
<br/>
The entry for Judi's box "Dartmoor Style" says "Grimspound Goddess" (?---<br/>
---) No. 31,802 . 70p from the SE gate, bearing 150 degrees to a rocky<br/>
nose just above a large flat rock.<br/>
<br/>
[Note that is Dartmoor letterbox, thirty-one thousand, eight hundred and<br/>
two ! ..What's the US count ?  I often wonder why you don't number yours ?]<br/>
<br/>
We also number our "moving boxes" , or what LbNA call "hitch-hikers" !  We<br/>
count those separately ie M-counts ..ooh dear not another code ...P,F,X,<br/>
now M ....But then there are T's ..and B's and even W's ......<br/>
...and another variety of "P".......<br/>
.....................er help !! <lol><br/>
<br/>
I would be very pleased write a longer piece about Dartmoor history for<br/>
LbNA if you wish..but the raw data is ..<br/>
<br/>
The First Letterbox was placed by<br/>
<br/>
" James Perrot " (with an e)<br/>
<br/>
Who lived in what is still today a wonderful town, lost in time, called<br/>
"Chagford" !<br/>
<br/>
The first Letterbox was<br/>
<br/>
.. at a place called "Cranmere Pool" <br/>
...............(the box is close by)<br/>
...............(Cranmere Pool is a remote place !) <br/>
...............(It isn't actually a pool at all !)<br/>
<br/>
..the year was 1854...<br/>
<br/>
Or more simply ..this year marks 147 years of letterboxing..<br/>
<br/>
Or 2004 is our 150th anniversary !  <br/>
<br/>
Not bad ..a ready made tradition (in a box <g>) ! <lol><br/>
<br/>
The location is now marked on all the (Official and Govt) Maps as<br/>
"Letterbox Memorial" <br/>
<br/>
......and for no reason I can fathom it is "Letterbox No 12" !! <eh?><br/>
<br/>
(Yep we Brits are crazy!)<br/>
<br/>
The official clue is <br/>
"Cranmere Pool" (603? 858?) No 12. Shown on map.<br/>
<br/>
..It is maintained in a very very very special letterbox..by volunteer<br/>
boxers ... It has to be seen to be believed !<br/>
<br/>
All the visitors books are maintained and are on public display ...<br/>
<br/>
It is a top-collectors "must have stamp" to put in your book...and it<br/>
changes too !!! <br/>
<br/>
Arghhhhh!  So you just have to make the pilgrimage across the quaking bogs<br/>
and bottomless mires more than once !!! <br/>
<br/>
Shock !!   &gt;:-o  <g><br/>
<br/>
Hope that "potty history" is what you were after Eric...<br/>
<br/>
and whilst I am musing...I was thinking that a meet of LbNA members on the<br/>
"original" moors might be nice..and given enough time to plan I can gain<br/>
access to a nice big house on Dartmoor with with a dozen bed rooms<br/>
suitable for a "modest" gathering ..so should you wish to visit .. and we<br/>
can discover enough equally crazy LbNA enthusiasts ...It could be arranged<br/>
that James Perrot's "Cranmere Pool" stamp could be in your book too... !<br/>
<br/>
Is that a plain F count or maybe a D count for Dartmoor I wonder ?<br/>
<chuckle chuckle=""><br/>
<br/>
Finally you say :<br/>
<br/>
&gt;When the Smithsonian article came out I was immediately intrigued. I<br/>
&gt;emailed the magazine and received a reply that there was already an<br/>
&gt;internet link. I thought I must be really slow because no matter how I<br/>
&gt;tried that link all I got were errors. <br/>
<br/>
When I first came into contact with US letterboxers we communicated using<br/>
a long CC list in our emails ..and so I guess not many ..if any of these<br/>
exchanges survive...<br/>
<br/>
Then Eric (Doc Mings) in Florida began the ILC and the first group<br/>
addresses began...subsequently Danl ran a group and now the all amazing<br/>
and sparkling LbNA site is a wonder with yahoo/egroups and lotsa brilliant<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to compare it to the first few months of excited personal<br/>
exchanges...<br/>
<br/>
I am amazed to hear you spent a year in the wilderness !  It was red hot<br/>
boiling exchanges on the boxing sites in them thar days ! <g> ...Some days<br/>
at my terminal it seemed the emails were written in blood and bile ..as<br/>
some 'oldies' will recall !!!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I came back to the bookmark after<br/>
&gt;a year finally actually connected to a web page. However, all my attempts<br/>
&gt;to connect to the group seemed to fail. It was very frustrating, so I<br/>
&gt;vented and sure enough got a reply right away! So I guess the moral for<br/>
<br/>
&gt;me was 1. be polite,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Well .."Polite".. was not the only way it went in the earliest days...<br/>
<br/>
Its seems to me that the LbNA "web-marshalls" have tamed the Wild West of<br/>
Letterboxing now <lol><br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2. stick to it. <br/>
<br/>
Oh yes do keep hunting and trying..it is a crazy and frustrating hobby at<br/>
times..but worth it ! imho !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have not been disappointed. I have stamps from Illinois, Oregon,<br/>
&gt;Michigan,  and attempts in Minnesota, Wisconsion, and I keep thinking<br/>
&gt;about the ??? in Ohio!.<br/>
<br/>
The spirit of the true boxer is obviously with you..you are as we in<br/>
Dartmoor say "boxious" !<br/>
<br/>
There is no cure now ! <lol><br/>
<br/>
&gt; My travels do not yet take me east, heavy<br/>
&gt;sigh,someday...._____________________________<br/>
<br/>
You're very welcome as far East as Dartmoor anytime !<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing <br/>
