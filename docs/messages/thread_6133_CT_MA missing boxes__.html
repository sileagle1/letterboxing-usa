<div>My husband and I started letterboxing a few months 
ago, and since then we've found 38 boxes, placed 2, and missed 5.  I was 
wondering how we should go about notifying others of lost boxes.  It looks 
like people post their misadventures here, but are we also supposed to contact 
the owners of the box?  What if we don't have contact info?  Do we 
contact the webmasters?  When we place boxes, should we give an email 
address with the clues so folks can contact us with problems?  Just wanted to figure out the most expedient way of notifying 
others about problems.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We've had a great time letterboxing thus far, with 
relatively few bad experiences.  Even when we couldn't find the box, it was 
still worth it for the nice walk.  The boxes we had trouble with 
were:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>--Bunny in the Briar Patch (mystery box in MA... I 
think this got pulled off the website after we went looking for it)</div>
<div>--Fairy Pool (Glastonbury, CT)... I know the box is 
there, but we couldn't find it and I sprained my ankle on the slippery rocks 
(hazard of the sport, I suppose!)</div>
<div>--Mt. Higby (Middletown, CT)... I'm fairly certain 
we found the spot it should have been... there was a pile of suspicious looking 
rocks, but no letterbox.</div>
<div>--"George" (part of the Beatles series in Essex, 
CT)...we found all the others of this series, but couldn't find Georgie after 
searching for quite a while.</div>
<div>--the "Witches Treasure" (follow the clues from 
several letterboxes at Chatfield Hollow, CT)... searched and searched in what 
appeared to be the correct spot, but couldn't find it... found all the others at 
this park... maybe the treasure was simply exhausted?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To all you fellow letterboxers:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for all the fun!</div>
<div>Check out my two boxes in Chester, CT (Pattaconk 
Reservoir Walk... posted on the newsgroup, but not up on the site 
yet).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To the webmasters:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for the lovely web pages!  I think the 
LBNA web page is very well done, with nice graphics.</div>

<div>Laura,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are able to contact the owner of the box, 
that is the best method. Otherwise, post it to this list. I'd suggest putting 
the name of the missing box in the subject to maybe get the owner's 
attention.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sending it to the webmasters won't help. They will 
only remove clues or put up notices on the clue page at the owner's 
request.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for the feedback about my questions.  You're all such nice 
folks...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Aili-- I absolutely adored your Black Knight and Guinevere boxes.  The 
stamps are beautiful.  Nice research and story, too.  Both boxes were 
in good order when I visited them on 6/21/02.</div>
