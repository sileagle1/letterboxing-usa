                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since I was spending Thanksgiving with my son and his family, they had to<br/>
be introduced to letterboxing. On Wed. we started at Emory University<br/>
with a nice walk around Chandler Lake in Lullwater Park and got the<br/>
Easter Egg. Then we headed for Stone Mt. to see how many of those 4 we<br/>
could get before we ran out of time. Picked up Jolly G-Man's Strength<br/>
pretty easily (the 10 year old actually found it) and started around the<br/>
Mt. to Ryan's Stone Mt. box. Because of our schedule we had to turn back<br/>
before we got there, not knowing where "there" was exactly and the 10 yr.<br/>
old was wearing out. Prior plans included a hike on the A.T. in northern<br/>
Georgia (mother and son deal) but my son decided he wasn't going to be<br/>
out done by letterboxers, so off we go back to Stone Mt. and nabbed  The<br/>
Stone Mt. box, Eagles Home and Whiskers not all of them easily. The<br/>
distances there were much longer than in Ct. but good planting and lots<br/>
of fun. I may have convinced my son to plant some and next time I'm there<br/>
I'll definitely bring along a couple to leave behind.<br/>
Thanks for the boxes.<br/>
