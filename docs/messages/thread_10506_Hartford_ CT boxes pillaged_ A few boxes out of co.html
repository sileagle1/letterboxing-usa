<br/>
missing.  I will probably have them replanted in different locations <br/>
<br/>
with different stamps soon after the snow melts.  They were an early <br/>
<br/>
attempt and some of the locations are little obvious.  I will post to <br/>
<br/>
the list when the whole group is in good working order again.<br/>
<br/>
And Autumn Club, also in Hartford, has been stolen.  Here's the wierd <br/>
<br/>
part.  All signs of the box are completely gone, but lying on top of <br/>
<br/>
the newly fallen snow (from Sunday)in the hole where the box rested <br/>
<br/>
are<br/>
<br/>
1. a frozen neon pen on a string<br/>
2. 3 one dollar bills<br/>
3. the last piece in a starburst type candy pack with outer wrapper <br/>
4. a homemade tape that was labeled WHCN - Blues<br/>
and<br/>
5. a tiny little dog bone<br/>
<br/>
So odd.  At first I thought maybe it was a confused geocacher, <br/>
<br/>
but now I'm thinking a kid.  And not one of those good letterboxing <br/>
<br/>
type kids, either.  Nice of them to pay for my supplies. Autumn Club <br/>
<br/>
was also in a high traffic area, so I will probably not replant until <br/>
<br/>
I can find a safer place on that side of the park.  Again, it will <br/>
<br/>
probably be spring.<br/>

</p><p>I was still waiting to do Autumn Club as my 100th box.  I am  stuck at 99 since the Sharon gathering.  I've been swamped with work and studying and thought I would be able to just run down the street this weekend to get Autumn girls.  i guess she who hesitates is lost.   I hope we can go boxing soon with Irishtinker and gang.  Odilio
