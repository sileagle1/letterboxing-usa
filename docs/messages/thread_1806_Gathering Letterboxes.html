Trout Fishing in America<br/>

"In watermelon sugar the deeds were done and done again as my life is done in <br/>
watermelon sugar."<br/>
Richard Brautigan, 1968<br/>
<br/>
Two easy letterboxes on a one mile out-and-back hike by the southern lake.<br/>
<br/>
On CT Rte. 195 in Mansfield Center, turn east on Bassette's Bridge Road. Pass <br/>
the main entrance to Mansfield Hollow Park, and then pass the boat ramp. <br/>
After crossing over the lake, park on the right in the pull out.<br/>
<br/>
Walk east-southeast on the blue blazed Old Mansfield Hollow Trail above the <br/>
northeast side of the lake. Not far along, the trail decends gently and <br/>
subtley turns leftwards (southeast), away from the lake. With the water still <br/>
in sight, cut right (southwest) abut 100 feet to a large multi-trunked white <br/>
pine and look in the southern base for the Trout Fishing in America letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Continue a short way further down the trail to turn sharp left (northeast) <br/>
and meander to a stone wall. Heading north about 20 steps, find the In <br/>
Watermelon Sugar letterbox in the western face at a better stacked/less <br/>
tumbled section of wall.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy!<br/>

&gt;and might someone find "The Galilee Hitchhiker" in either of these?  <br/>
If not this time, perhaps the next Brautigan Box?<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes from a "Southern State" boxer who's wishing she could <br/>
come play in the snow with all you Southern New England boxers who'll <br/>
gather tomorrow.  Have fun and be safe.<br/>

My wife and son and I went out Saturday and located all three of the boxes<br/>
on BocaChica boulevard. I especially liked the Clarksville stamp!  We<br/>
stamped them and now have a better idea of how to do this. I had never been<br/>
out that far on that road before, so it was a nice drive. We plan to plant<br/>
some around this end of the valley, as soon as I can get some stamps carved<br/>
and get some boxes for them.  By the way, I love your stamp. Did you carve<br/>
it yourself?  How do you get those great colors?<br/>

I'm glad you found and enjoied my boxes!  Yes, I carved my stamp<br/>
myself.  I get the colors from a tri-color ink pad.  Color box makes<br/>
some really great raised pigment ink pads.  I look forward to finding<br/>
your boxes when I go back down there (hopefully this summer).<br/>
