                    <div class="plaintext-content">My Fellow Letterboxers, <br/>
<br/>
Saying a fond farewell to the VW Microbus, I boarded an early morning flight for the great state of Texas. Texas - the land of big hair, big hats, and big cars. Not having big hair or a big hat, I went for the big car and rented a brand new shiny silver Lincoln Towncar. <br/>
<br/>
Exploring the sights, I drove down to South Padre Island just in time for the Annual Sand Castle Days. I arrived in the middle of a most perplexing mystery. Seems the faces kept disappearing off of the sculptures. Didn't take me long to solve the crime. Sorry, Safari Man, you should have been a bit more discreet, not to mention on the ball. The Missing Store of Good Manners was already solved, and I don't believe those innocent sculptures were doing any accusing. The show was now able to continue, much to the relief of the sponsors, and all had a good time. <br/>
<br/>
Los Colores del Muerto Annual Day of the Dead Celebration in Port Isabel was an event not to be missed. Food, drink, music, decorations, alters, all to welcome the dead home for a few brief hours. Not wanting revenge from my esteemed forefathers, I purchased the best sweets and breads for their arrival. They must have been pleased as I live to tell the tale. <br/>
<br/>
It only makes sense that Texas, being the land of big cowboys, is where The World Championship Ranch Rodeo can be found. Packing up the brand new shiny silver Lincoln Towncar, I headed for Amarillo. This rodeo is the real McCoy. Not weekend pretend cowboys, but rather the real down on the ranch working variety. It is not easy to milk a wild cow. The Thompson Ranch boys showed how to do it right, taking the event winner prize home with them. But, I did not come here to talk about sand, the dead or milk; I came to talk letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxes in Texas; yup, they got um. Lot and lots of them; as of this writing about 1,800. But, Texas, just where are your mystery boxes? I hope you aren't considering 70's in the big numbers. For a state that does things in a big way, you are sadly lacking. The good news is Texans know their containers. Mostly lock n locks out there. Thumbs down on those still using the cheap containers. When hiding boxes, might be a good idea to make sure your coverage won't fly away; doesn't seem to be a lot of rocks in the area. Watch where you're putting your hands; rattlers don't like being disturbed anymore than I do. <br/>

Really now.  I cautioned the members of the Texas list to look out for you<br/>
and your penchant for finding yourself followed by missing things.  We DO<br/>
have valuable boxes in our state that we want to keep close to us!<br/>
<br/>
Upon reading your message, Boots Tex - a noted Texas letterboxer of<br/>
integrity and high regard, not to mention outstanding counting abilities -<br/>
pointed out your deficient counting skills.  We have over 2,400 boxes on<br/>
LBNA alone, and that doesn't count any of the ones that are on AQ and not on<br/>
LBNA.  Perhaps you have miscounted mystery boxes too?  Perhaps you haven't<br/>
looked everywhere the clues might be stashed away?<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm???  Sometimes mystery clues find themselves in mysterious places!<br/>

Inspector Gadget! I do believe I am much more handsome than he is. Not to mention, I don't wear a silly hat. <br/>
<br/>
Your valuables are safe with me. I find objects that are lost, not lose them. You, of all letterboxers, should have discovered this. Must I remind you of your missing sock?<br/>
<br/>
How good are you with dates? Must I also remind you that I was in the great state of Texas way back in October of 2007? Yes, you have increased the number of your letterboxers since that time. Now you are up to approximately 3,387. It saddens me to point out that your mystery boxes have not increased proportionately. So therefore, my dear shoeless one, you may inform the notable Boots Tex that my counting skills are not deficient. I only wish I could say the same as to your labeling skills. <br/>

My apologies on the name - it was purely a slip of the tongue...a Freudian<br/>
slip even, I assure you.<br/>
<br/>
Please note - I didn't say you lose items, but that items come up lost when<br/>
you are around.  And on that point, that's interesting in itself.  How<br/>
better to provide for one's livelihood than to drum up business.  Who ARE<br/>
your associates?  Could they be the very folks who have a way of coming up<br/>
with missing things?  Was Mark your minion before he reformed himself?<br/>
Could that be why he now has such an aversion to you? Hmmm?<br/>
<br/>
As to the sock - take no credit for that!  That soiled putrid pink thing was<br/>
back on my foot next to the vibrant purple one before you ever knew there<br/>
WAS a sock.  I found it myself through no help of yours!  And I didn't have<br/>
to ask directions to find it...<br/>
<br/>
I think it's time we Texans call out our own mysterious man who is a<br/>
character - Gryzzled Gryphon.  What do YOU make of this, oh Gryzzled One?<br/>

&gt; &gt; The real mystery is why you drove all the way from South Padre Island to Amarillo (almost 1000 miles) without stopping in the beautiful Hill Country, currently alive with wild flowers. We may not have many Mystery Boxes, but the ones we have are bigger! <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Letterboxes in Texas; yup, they got um. Lot and lots of them; as of this writing about 1,800. But, Texas, just where are your mystery boxes? I hope you aren't considering 70's in the big numbers. For a state that does things in a big way, you are sadly lacking. The good news is Texans know their containers. Mostly lock n locks out there. Thumbs down on those still using the cheap containers. When hiding boxes, might be a good idea to make sure your coverage won't fly away; doesn't seem to be a lot of rocks in the area. Watch where you're putting your hands; rattlers don't like being disturbed anymore than I do. <br/>

A letterbox in every county is indeed a worthy mission. An even worthier mission would be a mystery in every county. Why not start toward that goal in your two remaining virgin counties? Kill two birds with one stone, so to speak.<br/>

&gt; Actually, one of the big reasons there are so few Mystery boxes in TX is because for the last 2.5 years we have been on a mission to populate every county in TX with at least 1 box so that the LBNA clue page can be completely colored in.  With 254 counties spanning almost 270,000 square miles, you can imagine the effort this has taken, but I am happy to report that we are down to just 2 virgin counties left.  So don't let the lack of Mystery boxes stop you from visiting our letterbox-rich state!<br/>

You seem to be making the same point I just made. Of course, one can certainly think of addresses where a satisfying "mystery" could be constructed. One can also think of circumstances where an address, or a city, or even a county, would divulge too much information given the context of the rest of the clue.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't see "all cases," now, did I?<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, the point is that the author of a clue should be entitled to put just as much information into it as she sees fit, no more, no less, rather than altering her vision just to satisfy an arbitrary exercise. If that means using an entire state, continent, or globe as a canvas, so be it. If that means disclosing a county, or a city, or a neighborhod, or a stadium as a starting point, so be it.<br/>

The discussion of mystery vs county has evolved from the original premise that LBNA requires a county to be listed if you want it "colored" in.  If a 100% colored state map is your goal [as was the original premise Post 63598, then 63632], and the only box in the county is a mystery, the county must be identified.  Otherwise the discussion of mystery vs county is mute and up to the placer.<br/>

&gt; "I suppose, if you really wanted to, you could give the address. However, would that really be a mystery?" Is that a rhetorical question? You seem to be making the same point I just made. Of course, one can certainly think of addresses where a satisfying "mystery" could be constructed. One can also think of circumstances where an address, or a city, or even a county, would divulge too much information given the context of the rest of the clue.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn't see "all cases," now, did I?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At any rate, the point is that the author of a clue should be entitled to put just as much information into it as she sees fit, no more, no less, rather than altering her vision just to satisfy an arbitrary exercise. If that means using an entire state, continent, or globe as a canvas, so be it. If that means disclosing a county, or a city, or a neighborhod, or a stadium as a starting point, so be it.<br/>

&gt; Dear Otis' Friends,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I suppose, if you really wanted to, you could give the address. However, would that really be a mystery? From what I have experienced, most counties are large. I am sure, that those with imagination, could very well name a county and still be quite elusive as to the actual location. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sincerely, <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; In many cases, that sorta defeats the purpose. I suppose the "mystery" could give street address and detailed instructions as well, but then it's not much of a mystery, is it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; By the same token, many boxes coded as "non-Mysteries" by LBNA and Atlas Quest are quite mysterious.<br/>
