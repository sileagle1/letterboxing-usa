Since my wife doesn't work on Fridays and can watch the children - <br/>
and since I am hanging around Braintree tomorrow in anticipation of <br/>
your visit! - I took the day off today and drove down to Quabbin.<br/>
<br/>
It is truly an awesome place. The water level is down three to four <br/>
feet, I would say, but Boston still has a lot of water in reserve. I <br/>
don't know about the rest of Massachusetts - things were looking <br/>
pretty parched. We're not so bad off just a little farther north, <br/>
as you will see.<br/>
<br/>
Your clues and directions were just perfect. I loved the spot just <br/>
above the water and your salamander stamp. I was struck by its three <br/>
colors on the image in the box journal, and as I just happened to <br/>
have three shades of green with me, I tried the gradation too. Sweet! <br/>
I'm going to do more of this.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I only took two hours for the circuit, but I didn't get started <br/>
until late and I was hustling.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck tomorrow. Hope we get a chance to meet.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Hi Tom!  I'm using my brand-new computer purchased just this morning.  It <br/>
&gt; was so nice meeting you and your wife and kids, and the new kitten too!  It <br/>
&gt; was very gracious of you to invite me to your home.  Though we talked about <br/>
&gt; a number of things, I realized after I left that I never asked what you do <br/>
&gt; for a living!  I figure it cannot be 9-5 work if you're able to letterbox on <br/>
&gt; a weekday....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Real nice to meet you  too, Bonnie. I'm a school teacher, which is <br/>
how I have manage to have some days off during the summer. Since my <br/>
wife works four days a week, it really only amounts to one week-day a <br/>
week when I have the theoretical possibility of absconding from my <br/>
familial responsibilities. You probably noticed yesterday that <br/>
although the grass was still relatively green here in Vermont, the <br/>
yard itself was looking a bit neglected, the children a tad unwashed, <br/>
the house a mite dusty? BUT .. daddy had two new stamps in his <br/>
journal so everything is sweet.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Real nice to meet you  too, Bonnie. I'm a school teacher, which is<br/>
&gt;how I have manage to have some days off during the summer. Since my<br/>
&gt;wife works four days a week, it really only amounts to one week-day a<br/>
&gt;week when I have the theoretical possibility of absconding from my<br/>
&gt;familial responsibilities. You probably noticed yesterday that<br/>
&gt;although the grass was still relatively green here in Vermont, the<br/>
&gt;yard itself was looking a bit neglected, the children a tad unwashed,<br/>
&gt;the house a mite dusty? BUT .. daddy had two new stamps in his<br/>
&gt;journal so everything is sweet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Best,<br/>
