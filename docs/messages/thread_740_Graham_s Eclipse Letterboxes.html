letterboxes off the list, and I hope he doesn't mind that I forward his<br/>
gracious reply for all to see. This is the model for LBNA!!! These<br/>
folks in Dartmoor really understand letterboxing: thanks, Graham.<br/>

&gt;Graham, great to hear your voice again on the list. So how did your<br/>
&gt;marvelous sounding eclipse boxes go over? Could you post the stamp<br/>
&gt;images for all to see, or would that be cheating?<br/>
<br/>
Its hard to believe I've not been waxing lyrical since the 11<br/>
August...(e-day) ....<eclipse day=""> &lt;<grin>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes "God turned off the sun" <br/>
<br/>
It was awesome beyond my limited imagination to have appreciated in<br/>
advance !<br/>
<br/>
I have already booked a trip to Africa to see the next one in 2001....<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly in the middle of the day 11:20 ish ...the stars came out !<br/>
<br/>
My son and a good Letterboxing pal  and I were awaiting this event...it<br/>
began almost insignificantly...The sun was cut with a curved black<br/>
crescent..."OK" we thought  "it's got interesting" ...but we all agreed<br/>
that we were surprised what all the fuss was about..and surely no<br/>
medieval<br/>
farmer would even look up from his toil in the fields.....<br/>
<br/>
THEN....it got cold..about 10 degree drop in temperature..no small<br/>
change..a big drop !...<br/>
then all the birds landed and all the animals went quiet..it was a total<br/>
silence..even we went quiet..<no feat="" mean=""><br/>
<br/>
THEN it went BLACK !<br/>
<br/>
A huge and slow hand moved across my whole being...a simple, silent, and<br/>
effective gesture of cosmic authority....a small voice had just reminded<br/>
me of the power of the universe in which we live and the insignificance<br/>
of<br/>
us mere mortals....It wasn't at all malevolent..just so potent and<br/>
without<br/>
any hesitation or debate.<br/>
....and the stars looked down and winked in cheerful collusion...<br/>
<br/>
We found ourselves cheering and clapping..it was without precedent and<br/>
the<br/>
single most significant sight and sense of the skies I have ever<br/>
experienced.......<br/>
<br/>
I hear some folk have seen it dozens of time...now I know why.....It<br/>
was a<br/>
wonderful and ecstatic few minutes...and the sense of relief ..simple<br/>
and<br/>
happy relief when the sun and warmth and sound returned...then we could<br/>
all breathe again.....we danced about whooping and yelling like<br/>
teenagers<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
As to any special stamps ?...Sorry....They are no more..all gone ...Like<br/>
the eclipse...they are best seen live...No TV rerun can even begin to<br/>
capture them....<br/>
<br/>
So if you want to see e-stamps...come visit with me in Africa in 2001<br/>
for<br/>
the next time it happens......I will be there..the guy in the funny<br/>
purple<br/>
suit !<br/>
<br/>
See you there <br/>
