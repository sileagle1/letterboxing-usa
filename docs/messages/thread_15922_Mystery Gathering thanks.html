                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, Tom, for getting us all together.  :-)  How wonderful to have boxers from all over come to our gathering!  (Heaven knows most of us in RI hate to drive very far.)  It was a very good day, although it was almost all inside for Dan and myself.  Not only meeting new people and reacquainting with others, we made two nifty little books under Alafair's guidance. The lodge was great, and it would have still been a terrific (and dry) time if we had been hit with a storm.  With a late start due to family matters we didn't get much boxing in, but we did find a Corn Maiden and some new faces, mostly in the dark after the event.  So sad that we missed Chuck and Molly the wonder dog.  Maybe next time!!  <br/>
<br/>
Bon Voyage, Kiwis!  Keep in touch on the list!<br/>
<br/>
If you ever need assitance with gathers or in any way, Tom, let us know.<br/>
