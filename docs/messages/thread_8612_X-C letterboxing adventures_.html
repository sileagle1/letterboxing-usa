Greetings to all letterboxers.  I was sorry to have to have missed the mystery<br/>
gathering, but life, packing, and moving got in the way...<br/>
<br/>
After I had planned my route for X-C travel, I hopped onto the letterboxing<br/>
site to find myself some interesting diversions.  I'm happy to report that I<br/>
located 4 letterboxes (out of the 6 I searched for) in 4 different states, and<br/>
planted two of my own. (Both in North Dakota.  The poor state was just crying<br/>
out for more boxes. Details to come.)<br/>
<br/>
I began the letterboxing at Starved Rock Lodge in Illinois, where I found<br/>
Starved Lodge Box #1.  It was really neat, I enjoyed the place where it was hid<br/>
very much!<br/>
<br/>
In Iowa City, I encountered the Black Angel.  Spooky and cool.  The letterbox<br/>
seems to be fairly well visited.  <br/>
<br/>
Just South of Iowa City, in Riverside, IA, I had a very unsucessful search for<br/>
the Star Trek letterbox.  The site appears to have been vandalized, as the<br/>
cairn rocks were scattered and the box was nowhere to be found. :( <br/>
<br/>
In Minneapolis I searched for, but did not find the Rock of Racial Harmony Box.<br/>
 I did, however, enjoy my walk along the river. :)<br/>
<br/>
As I drove through North Dakota, I placed one box (quite precarious location)<br/>
in Fargo, and one by the Sweet Briar Lake.<br/>
<br/>
I then found the Burning Coal Vein/Columnar Cedars (1st box in N.D.) in what<br/>
has to be the most fantastical place this hobby has taken me yet, and I'm not<br/>
sure it could be topped.  I highly reccomend finding the box to everyone.  Yes,<br/>
it's in the middle of nowhere, but the directions are clear and concise, and<br/>
the box has had a mere three visitors in a year and a half.  It's worth the<br/>
drive.  Although I hear it's a bit snowy there now. :)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I located the microbox in Dinosaur Park, Rapid City, S.D. A neat<br/>
location, with a GREAT view of the city surrounding.<br/>
<br/>
After that, I was sick of driving, so I just tore thru the rest of the states<br/>
in two days.  I am enjoying my rest now that I have arrived in Seattle and I<br/>
suppose I will meet some of the leftcoasters quite soon!<br/>
