thanks to everyone who has agreed to put together a 'Visit Michigan' <br/>
letterbox for the event.  I've received a great response and even <br/>
have gotten a couple of the boxes mailed to me already!  They are <br/>
great and I can't wait to see the others.  It's exciting that so many <br/>
of our letterboxing cohorts across the country will be a part of our <br/>
first gathering in this way.<br/>
<br/>
There is still room for a few more if anyone else is interested in <br/>
contributing.  Details here:<br/>

Thanks again!<br/>
