<br/>
Took a few of my friends out for their first boxing trip today.  We had a <br/>
great time finding Amanda's boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone got a real kick out of the whole experience.  They especially <br/>
enjoyed looking at the log book and seeing the stamps and (funny) comments <br/>
from previous visitors.<br/>
<br/>
Amanda, your Schmitz Park boxes now have 6 new stamps each!  Oh, and by the <br/>
way, we all particularly liked your box 3 stamp.  =D<br/>
<br/>
As we returned to the parking lot, folks were talking about the next trip <br/>
and tossing around ideas for places to hide their own boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Wheee!<br/>
