<div>Hey everybody,</div>
<div>    We finally finished our clues to our 
2 new boxes at Rock Springs Wildlife Refuge in Scotland, CT.  
Enjoy!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p>Rock Springs Wildlife Refuge</p>
<p>Two letterboxes can be found on this easy, 3.3 mile hike along the Little 
River in Scotland.</p><b>
</b><p>The Directions: From 395 take exit 89 Route 14. Follow rte. 14 west for 
about 10 miles to 97 north (Pudding Hill Rd). Pass the James V. Spignesi 
Wildlife Management Area on your right. Then, look for a small parking area 
along the side of the road with a somewhat camouflaged sign reading Rock Springs 
Wildlife Refuge.</p><b>
<p>The Clues:</p></b>
<p>Check in at the bulletin board if you like</p>
<p>Then take the trail at 110</p>° to begin your hike.
<p>Pass twice through the place where Humpty sat</p>
<p>Then zig and zag downhill after that.</p>
<p>Then again- deja vu</p>
<p>Zig- zag again is what you will do.</p>
<p>At the intersection</p>
<p>Choose your direction.</p>
<p>Take the trail at 190</p> degrees
<p>Soon you’ll pass through small white pine trees.</p>
<p>Go up and down over glacial moraine</p>
<p>On the white is where you should remain.</p>
<p>At the "T" take the trail at 160</p>° of course
<p>Here you will find a Native American H2O source.</p>
<p>The Old Indian Spring is protected by stone now</p>
<p>But in the stream, smaller springs still bubble up- Wow!</p>
<p>Re-trace your steps past your last trail</p>
<p>Continue up over the esker, you will not fail.</p>
<p>At the junction, 42</p>° is 
the way to go.
<p>Stop when you find the tall soldiers standing in a row.</p>
<p>March up to the 18th soldier on the right</p>
<p>One wearing a patch of white.</p>
<p>At a bearing of 293</p>°
<p>Sight three trunks from just one tree.</p>
<p>(You will see it’s actually 4 as you get closer)</p>
<p>Run to this tree, quick as a fox</p>
<p>Down low you will find your first letterbox.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve found it, leave the soldiers behind</p>
<p>Along the Little River the trail will now wind.</p>
<p>You’ll come to bridge, trip trap over the planks</p>
<p>While looking for beaver in the river and on the banks.</p>
<p>260</p>° at the 
"Y", no need to worry
<p>Continue, cross a bridge hurry, hurry.</p>
<p>Up, up, and away... from the river you bend</p>
<p>Follow this path to the junction at the end.</p>
<p>At the junction take the path promising views</p>
<p>At the next split, the trail at 30</p>° you choose.
<p>Follow Jack and Jill till you find a great throne of stones</p>
<p>Enjoy the views and rest your weary bones.</p>
<p>166</p>° your compass should 
read
<p>At the 1st stone wall stop to succeed.</p>
<p>Follow the wall like the setting sun</p>
<p>18 paces, almost done.</p>
<p>Behind small mica covered rocks</p>
<p>You will find the Little River 
Letterbox!</p></div></body></html>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!!! 9 letterboxers (with a total of 20 legs between us) spent a <br/>
great afternoon at Rock Springs in CT yesterday. Sometimes the kids <br/>
are really "on," and this is one of those memories that I think we'll <br/>
share for a long time! They were so intrigued to discover what <br/>
the "soldiers" were, and when I heard the delighted screaming from <br/>
way ahead I knew it must be something marvelous. When I got down the <br/>
esker and caught up with them they were just smiling and pointing in <br/>
awe at their discovery. We spent an hour at the Stone Throne picnic-<br/>
ing and throwing branches off the cliff (8 year old boys along....), <br/>
and necking (16 year old teenagers along as well.....). Thank you so <br/>
much, Melissa and Dan!<br/>
<br/>
And, by the way, EXCELLENT work on the hand cut stamps!!! By far some <br/>
of the best images we've collected!<br/>
<br/>
Jay and the drew-crew, extra legs, throwing sticks, and boyfriends <br/>
included.<br/>
