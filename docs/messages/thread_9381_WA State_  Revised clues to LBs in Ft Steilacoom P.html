If you spook easily at cemeteries, you might want to bypass this <br/>
one, I recommend that you select a different letterbox to undertake<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  Start in the cemetery.  Find gravestone marker #89.  Add 111 <br/>
to its number to get the degrees that will lead you to a fir with <br/>
a `ghostly' neighbor.  At its base and `buried' under some bark lies <br/>
the box you seek as it rests in peace (hopefully).<br/>

Purple Pumpkin Letterbox<br/>
Placed:  31 October 2002, Clues Revised:  26 November 2002<br/>
<br/>
Park in the parking lot near Barn #2.  Have you ever seen a purple <br/>
pumpkin???  This just might be your chance!!!<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  From the road N of Barn #2, head along the gravel road at <br/>
about 120.  At the chunky wooden bench, turn R until 3 firs on your <br/>
L you find.  Turn L, then when concrete meets you perpendicularly <br/>
turn R and continue along the concrete and sandstony path.  At the <br/>
intersecting dirt path, turn L, continue along it and stay on the <br/>
main wide dirt path as you head up a small hill.  Cross the gravel <br/>
path and continue straight on the narrow path (approx 145), R at the <br/>
next `T', then L at the following `T', R at the next `Y' toward the <br/>
treeline, L at the `Y' and R at the `T' following along the trail <br/>
that borders the treeline.  Head up a slight hill and L at next <br/>
small dirt trail uphill into the woods (you see, odd purple pumpkins <br/>
are only found in odd little places).  R at the `T', R at `T' <br/>
downhill, L at `T' uphill.  From the cut tree in the trail, 13 steps <br/>
to a log R of trail.  The purple pumpkin is nestled on the uphill <br/>
side among the brambles and bark.  You see purple pumpkins can grow <br/>
anywherethey're just difficult to find!!!<br/>
