at Salmon Falls, near the town of Washougal, Clark County, Washington.<br/>
This is a Migratory Letterbox that began life on the rocky shores of<br/>
New England. It has since made its way west, with a sojourn in<br/>
Southern California and is now making a stop in the Pacific Northwest.<br/>
It will be here until late spring when it will leave on the last leg<br/>
of the northern journey to its redd in Alaska. <br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: Your destination is the bridge over the Washougal<br/>
River at the intersection of Washougal River Road and Salmon Falls<br/>
Road. This can be reached from downtown Washougal (12 miles) or from<br/>
the first left after mile marker 25 on Highway 14 (4 miles.) There is<br/>
parking at either end of the bridge. <br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Walk upstream along the road until you reach a<br/>
yellow metal gate. Go through the gate, down the gravel road until a<br/>
band of cement crosses your path. Backtrack eighteen steps. Before you<br/>
unearth the letterbox, be sure to look back at the bridge to be sure<br/>
no one is watching. In season there may be people standing there<br/>
watching the salmon jumping the falls or gathering in pools<br/>
downstream. The box is nestled at the foot of the forked tree to your<br/>
left.<br/>
