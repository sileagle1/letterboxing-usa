                    <html><body><p>Hi, I don't have anything against responsible hunters. I'm a NRA member myself but I personally don't hunt. You are right about a few bad apples. Those are the ones I worry about. we had a couple bad experiences here in Eastern CT. One person was shot in Coventry by a person who had so many violations he was denied a hunting license. This man went anyway, on a Sunday, (which is illegal in CT) with no license and shot a man he thought was a deer. He did go to jail but still, a man died. I have seen many hunters in the woods over the years with no problems at all. It is the one bad apple with a gun or bow that you don't want to run into. I do admit that most hunters are responsible, have the right to hunt, and should have the right. Just everyone out there be careful.....Chuck &amp; Molly

They are held on with velcro and work <br/>fairly well. For the deeper woods I also have a bell  that I can <br/>attach to her collar. You can get a package of them at Walmart in the <br/>crafts section for a couple bucks. Yes, I have a story of  2 coyotes <br/>attacking my dog. Different dog about 20 years ago in Lebanon. Long <br/>story but a human shooting a colt .38 revolver over their heads while <br/>they are tumbling around with my dog and rushing at them with a 4 <br/>inch knife blade works well in scaring them off. They didn't believe <br/>in coyotes in CT at that time except for some farmers. The dog did <br/>need to get some stitches and the vet wrote it off as wild dogs. <br/>Coyotes go to rip open the belly. I now have a letterbox in Lebanon <br/>within a mile of where that happened. It's called "In Memory of <br/>Brandi". She died years later of natural causes.  We also were both <br/>almost shot in Hebron by kids shooting in the fish and game club but <br/>the some bullets were going through the woods and making a whizzing <br/>sound as they passed by us before they made thud as they hit trees. <br/>Then I have my snake stories huge snapping turtles, dirt bikes, dogs <br/>falling through ice, sinking in mud, all sorts of fun.  My view is <br/>that my dog is hiking with me as a friend and fellow hiker, not to <br/>protect me. I am there to protect her. Molly sounds a lot like Ozzy. <br/>She is a big coward and loves everybody and everything. Some sort of <br/>weapon may be in order on some trips. Thats more of a personal choice <br/>of what you are comfortable with. My point is that yes you do take a <br/>chance when taking a dog out into the woods. I pay more attention to <br/>protecting Molly than myself. This is the first year I am considering <br/>wearing orange myself. Some of these guys out there don't deserve the <br/>right to hunt when you hear about their behavior. If you want any <br/>more info on hiking with a dog, I'd be glad to help if I <br/>can.....Chuck and Molly <br/><br/>I'm a hunter.  I found my first letterbox last week while I was <br/>hunting.  Most hunters are responsable.  We have a good ethic.  But a <br/>few rotten apples always spoil the barrel.  You should always wear <br/>orange during hunting season.  It's a good idea to put orange on your <br/>dog to.  Cool club you have here, who made it?  I'd like to find some <br/>more boxes, but I like to hunt more, and you can only do that now <br/>(legally).  But now I have something to hunt during the off season.<br/><br/>Lurty<br/><br/></tt><br/><br/><tt>To unsubscribe: mailto:letterbox-usa-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br/>List etiquette, info, etc: <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html">http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html</a><br/></tt><br/><br/><tt>Your use of Yahoo!

Used to shoot in competition with a local handgun club and just kept <br/>
renewing membership. Sounds like you found a home made stamp. There <br/>
are also store bought ones available. Not sure in your area where <br/>
they are sold. Letterboxers use both store bought and they also make <br/>
their own. Someone from your state could better tell you where they <br/>
can be bought or where the material to make them can be bought. I get <br/>
mine at a local store. They are not part of a chain or anything like <br/>
that. Good luck with your hunting this season and hope you continue <br/>
letterboxing also.....Chuck<br/>
