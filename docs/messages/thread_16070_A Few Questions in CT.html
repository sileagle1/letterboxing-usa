Hi. Always willing to help a newcomer.<br/>
1) The interesting thing is to identify a letterboxer.  If you see <br/>
them on the trail look for tell tail signs, walking with clues in <br/>
hand, wandering aimlessly, looking at a compass, ink on fingers, <br/>
etc.  I met Chuck &amp; Chickabirdy &amp; Molly when Chuck said "LBNA?".  <br/>
When I responded with knowledgeable grunts, I was identified.  At <br/>
the gathering you will see lots of inky fingers.<br/>
Then you stamp each others log book and write a nice note, like <br/>
stamping in at a box.<br/>
2) Yes, this comming Saturday.  Not everybody will be on the Cape.<br/>
3) The web site is not up to date on the regailia.  Go to the web <br/>
site of the talk list(groups.yahoo.com/letterbox-usa), click on <br/>
messages, enter "LBNA patch" or "LBNA badge" in the box next <br/>
to "search archive", and click on the button.  The latest info is in <br/>
messages by Kay Momhers.<br/>
Hope to see you Saturday.<br/>
