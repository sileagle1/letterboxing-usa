                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's a tough question, actually.  Hitchhikers should be smallish.  Letterbox stamps are always grand and easier to detail when they're big, but to be considerate, one doesn't really know if the finders have a goodly-sized notebook on the trail.  Diane and I started with a little one before we saw the size of some stamps.  There are a few early stamps in our collection that are continued on another page, I'm afraid.<br/>
<br/>
Still, the big ones truly can be impressive.  I tend to stay not much larger than one or two inches by up to three inches.  I also back the stamp, and I don't want the box to fill up too much.  I like leavin room for hitchikers!<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I'd say that the canvas depends on the picture.<br/>
