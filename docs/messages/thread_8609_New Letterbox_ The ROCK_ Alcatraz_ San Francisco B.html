<p>The ROCK
</p>
<p>Alcatraz, San Francisco Bay, CA
<br/>Placed 10/20/02 by Thleen F1 P1 &amp; Le Saint de M.V F3 P4
</p>
<p>Terrain: Steep but paved.
<br/>Clues: Easy
<br/>Cost: Min. $9.25, more with the Audio Tour at the time of this posting
<br/>Check www.blueandgoldfleet.com/abcsc.htm for details.
</p>
<br/>
<p>The residents came from many walks
<br/>Some were smart but all were caught.
<br/>One way in and two ways out.
<br/>One's alive the other's naught.
<br/>Over the days and years I'm told
<br/>Some grew weary some grew bold
<br/>But never the less they all grew old
<br/>Some were strong and some were ill
<br/>Some lived long and some were killed
<br/>Those that couldn't walk out the gate
<br/>Were lain to rest but not in state.
<br/>Visit this place of silent din
<br/>where mortals past are interred in.
<br/>Look to your left and see what may rise
<br/>They don't go to heaven in anyone's eyes
<br/>Look beneath, for that's where it lies
<br/>Make sure you're not seen by any spies
<br/>There are some boards there is no ledge
<br/>It's behind these that The ROCK is wedged
