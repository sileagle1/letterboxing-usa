didn't know "Wellston" and "Zaleski"<br/>
were in Vinton Co.--LOL.<br/>
<br/>
So, a tree indentification series might be useful?<br/>
Sounds like I may have volunteered. :-)<br/>
I'll need to brush up a bit myself.<br/>
Mind if I check out the pre-carves?<br/>
For placement stamps, I mean.<br/>
I'm much much more into the hiking aspect &amp; I'm<br/>
sure I lack the talent to carve, say, even a maple leaf!<br/>
<br/>
And yes, an exchange sounds exciting--maybe before school starts?<br/>
My dragons would love to meet Mama Stork--<br/>
They get very excited when they find your logo!<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Well Hi there Froggiebaby!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am excited to see a new S. Ohioan--tho I must confess I am in the SW<br/>
Ohio<br/>
&gt; area.  BigGuy and Mr. Bloodhound  kindly let us sneak East to box every<br/>
now<br/>
&gt; and again!  Both are great people--as are BigGuys family.  I am planning a<br/>
&gt; trip out your way soon; perhaps we can meet up for an exchange?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mr. Bloodhound's clues are on the LbNA site.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as I know, there is not a specific series on trees, tho I have come<br/>
&gt; across an occasional plant such as you describe.  I personally would enjoy<br/>
&gt; such a series as I am striving to learn to distinguish amongst trees now<br/>
&gt; that I am out and about in nature  (My first challenge is to accurately<br/>
&gt; identify poison ivy tho!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Looking forward to finding some of your boxes eventually, and of course,<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; meeting you on the trail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mama Stork<br/>
&gt; aka Pam in Cinci<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Good advice Mama Stork. Funny about the "visible corner," too!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have a question for Southern Ohio boxers:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is there a "tree identification" series out there any where? You know,<br/>
&gt; &gt; perhaps an oak leaf stamp placed by an oak tree, ect.?<br/>
