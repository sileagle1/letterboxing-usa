The South Rim Trail is one of the most scenic hikes in the Oak <br/>
Mountain system.  To find the letterbox, begin at the North Trailhead <br/>
and follow the South Rim Trail.  This is a moderately strenuous hike <br/>
with many inclines early and easier hiking later.  Take your time to <br/>
enjoy the wonderful overlooks along the way.  Follow the trail until <br/>
you find a wooden trail sign indicating that Peavine Falls is 3.2 <br/>
miles ahead.  A side trail arises at this point which leads east to <br/>
the south ridge of Double Oak Mountain.  Follow this trail to the <br/>
ridge and continue along this ridge trail as it curves to the north.  <br/>
You will reach a stone fire circle on the west side of a large rock <br/>
formation.  The rock formation has a shallow cave on its south end.  <br/>
Circle around the south end of the rock and continue to its east <br/>
side.  Here there is another stone fire circle.  Standing in the <br/>
center of this circle, take a 290 facing.  Step 2 paces to the<br/>
base of the rock formation.  Directly ahead, at eye level, a vertical <br/>
crevice in the rock points downward to The South Rim Letterbox.  <br/>
Climb the rock to uncover it.<br/>
This is a great site for a picnic lunch.  I recommend that you <br/>
obtain a trail map from the park office before searching for this <br/>
box.  The search can be incorporated into several possible loop hikes <br/>
from the North Trailhead.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if the letterbox is missing or damaged.<br/>
