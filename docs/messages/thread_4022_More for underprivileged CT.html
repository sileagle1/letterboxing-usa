Town: Essex<br/>
County: Middlesex<br/>
State: Ct<br/>
Placed: 12/29/01 by the Drew Family<br/>
<br/>
And Then There Were Three<br/>
(A tag-along letterbox)<br/>
<br/>
"Three score twice is a century and twenty<br/>
To be together that long, there must be love aplenty."<br/>
<br/>
If you don't get LOTS finding your way aCROSS<br/>
To a certain PRESERVE you'll think you're the boss:<br/>
<br/>
Stroll back up to the lane and walk on down<br/>
the lower path, heading SSW.<br/>
Drop downhill past a big glacial erratic<br/>
and through the wood-pile field.<br/>
<br/>
Then straight you'll go<br/>
through another, smaller field.<br/>
Pass through the large-stoned wall<br/>
to an old orchard,<br/>
and just to the east<br/>
spot an abandoned gate<br/>
and Alexis' Stone.<br/>
<br/>
Now, inside the stone fenced corner,<br/>
11 GIANT steps south<br/>
to the multi-trunked swamp maple<br/>
(there are 7 trunks this winter and<br/>
the whole place has the fragrance of candles).<br/>
<br/>
In the top of this stone wall:<br/>
And Then There Were Three.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy!<br/>
