missing. My parents were visiting from NY and thought<br/>
they'd stamp in but he was no where to be found.  I<br/>
don't know if he was picked up by park personnel or if<br/>
he washed away with our torrential rains on Friday.  I<br/>
will be checking the park a little further but fear<br/>
that he's gone for good.  I'll post to the list when<br/>
he is replaced.  <br/>
<br/>
On another note they found their first hitchhiker in<br/>
the Ft. Story box--Tom the Turkey.  I'll let you know<br/>
when Tom finds a new box to reside in.<br/>
