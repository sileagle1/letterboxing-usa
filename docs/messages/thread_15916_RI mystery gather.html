credit him for the weather, which was spectacular, but for the lovely meeting spot <br/>
and accomodations for the day.  Food, as always, was excellent.<br/>
thanks, too, to Alafair for the instructions on book making.  Now if I get <br/>
brave enough to try it on my own...<br/>
Great to meet new and old friends and<br/>
I got my 500th find in Wickford!<br/>
A very successful day!!<br/>
