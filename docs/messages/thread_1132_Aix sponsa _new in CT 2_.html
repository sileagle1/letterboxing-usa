Here's an easy 1-1/2 mile dabble with a brace of letterboxes near the <br/>
duck pond at Pequot Woods in Mystic, CT. Perfect for the hatchlings <br/>
in your brood, this short and level flight might sometimes give <br/>
waterfowl slightly damp webbed feet.<br/>
<br/>
Flyway: From I95 in Mystic CT, take exit 89 (Allyn Street) and turn <br/>
south from the ramp towards Mystic. Bank right at the first street <br/>
and follow Sandy Hollow Rd 0.2 miles to the nesting area on your left.<br/>
<br/>
Migration: Take wing southwards around the gate and follow the stone <br/>
wall past wetlands on your right to a junction with a nice trail map. <br/>
Migrate straight south for a clockwise loop. At the southern turn of <br/>
your journey, bank left on 250 degrees toward Stone Bridge. After a <br/>
few flaps of the wing, watch on your left for a waist-high boulder <br/>
split in three like a deck of cards. Behind it is a maple and behind <br/>
that is a single clutch in a nest.<br/>
<br/>
Your V formation can continue down this path to Rte. 1 and back if <br/>
you'd like. Then fly back up to the main migration route and bank <br/>
left to continue your clockwise loop. You'll pass a clearing and an <br/>
old farm site. At the end of the east-running cobblestone walkway, <br/>
soar over the wall to your left just before a chestnut tree and quack <br/>
loudly when you spot the second nestling of the day.<br/>
<br/>
Now fly your flock down to the original trail junction and point your <br/>
pinfeathers left, north, to return to your incubator. <br/>

As I recall, my Mud Pond box also featured Aix sponsa on the wing. <br/>
