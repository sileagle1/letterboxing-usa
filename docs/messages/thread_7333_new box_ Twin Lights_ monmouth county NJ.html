                    <html><body>This is the beginning of a series of boxes in NJ lighthouses-I hope.  Box #1 is yet to be planted since the SAndy Hook Lighthouse is under some renovation and I wasn't sure if I could get out there.  So, this is #2<br/>
Name: Twin Lights Box<br/>
Location: Highlands, Nj (Monmouth County)<br/>
Difficulty: Easy; the lighthouse museum is wheelchair accessible, nicely paved walkways<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
Take the Garden State Parkway to exit 117.<br/>
Follow the signs to Route 36 and the Twin Lights Historical Museum (sorry, I don't have any idea of the mileage.  I came in from my parents' house the other direction)<br/>
Once locating the park take a look at the lense-Isn't it magnificent?  And those life saving boats!  I'm glad I'd never have to be in one.<br/>
Check out the museum inside.  This is where Marconi sent his first radio message.  You can go to the top of the north tower and look out at the view.  You can't see Ct from there, but a lot of Long Island is visible.<br/>
Follow the red brick path to the 'water side' of the building.  What a view, even on a cloudy day!<br/>
Find the Twin Lights mystery.  With your back to the mystery, take a compass reading of 94 degrees (my Dad is very specific!)<br/>
Below the wall is your treasure.<br/>
Follow the path around the building-don't trip over the bollard-and you will find a picnic grove if you want to rest there a bit.<br/>
Be careful that no one is peaking over the wall when hiding the box.<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
