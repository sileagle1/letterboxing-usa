                    <div class="plaintext-content">This morning A.I. &amp; myself arrive at the Moki Woki whatever Trailhead <br/>
to seek out Ryan's new box &amp; determine whether it had fallen prey to <br/>
the Malibu fire.  2 vehicles are in the lot, both of which had their <br/>
windows smashed out.  Called rangers, &amp; while awaiting their arrival, <br/>
one of the victims returns from his hike.  He isn't overly bothered <br/>
by the situation, as he is a NBC News producer &amp; leaves for Iraq next <br/>
week, to cover the big show.  Apparently the prospect of spending the <br/>
next few months in Iraq puts ones priorities in order...<br/>
By the time Ranger Girl arrived &amp; we finished trading war stories, it <br/>
was well past noon &amp; I had visions of Donuts dancing in my head, so <br/>
we aborted our quest for the box.<br/>
But at least I can report to you that 1), this trailhead is not a <br/>
good place to leave valuables in your car, &amp; B), the fire didn't get <br/>
within a mile of this letterbox, so it should be fine.  Will return <br/>
soon.<br/>
