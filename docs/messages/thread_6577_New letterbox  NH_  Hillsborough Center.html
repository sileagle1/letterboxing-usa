Hillsborough Center, New Hampshire<br/>
<br/>
Planted July 20, 2002 by rtrw and HEA (inspired and motivated by CERK)<br/>
<br/>
Distance - a stone's throw <br/>
Time - ten minutes?<br/>
Difficulty - not as easy as I had planned, but easyish.<br/>
<br/>
In 1769, Colonel John Hill, a masonian proprietor, "granted forever" a <br/>
tract of land in and around this triangle plot of land to the first <br/>
settled minister Reverend Jonathan Barnes, providing locations for the <br/>
church, meeting house, minister's homestead, school, town pound, <br/>
training field, and burying ground. Worthy of note is that descendants <br/>
of the original grantee still occupy many of these 18th and 19th <br/>
century homes.<br/>
<br/>
To find the starting point, go to downtown Hillsboro where Routes 149 <br/>
and 9 intersect.  At the traffic light, head north for 3.3 miles.  You <br/>
will pass the schools and some lovely farms.  At approximately 3.1 <br/>
miles you will have an opportunity at a fork to veer left onto East <br/>
Washington Road.  Please do that.  The town pound is the stony <br/>
structure just beyond the schoolhouse on the left.  <br/>
<br/>
Hop out of your car and check out our cool town pound.  Imagine the <br/>
unclaimed livestock waiting to be redeemed by their owners.<br/>
<br/>
Standing right next to the southeastern point of the pound, head 20 <br/>
paces (40 steps) at 210 degrees.  You will need to step around several <br/>
obstacles, so keep that in mind as you go.  You are looking for a tree <br/>
that resembles a quirky bunny with very long, thick ears, an antelope, <br/>
or an upside down lower case "h".  The planters could not reach <br/>
consensus as to what this interesting tree looked like. There is <br/>
currently an old log resting between the ears/antlers.  You will know <br/>
it when you see it.<br/>
<br/>
Now head at 235 degrees from the creature tree for 6 paces.  You are <br/>
looking for a rock that could be a ramp. <br/>
