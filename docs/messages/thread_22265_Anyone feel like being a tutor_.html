Similar to my last post, any worthwhile carvers in the southern MA <br/>
area willing to get together with me for a little carving lesson?  I'm <br/>
primarily interested in image transfer ...<br/>
<br/>
If you've mastered the technique of transfer and carving, I'd love to <br/>
learn.  Reading an article about it isn't quite as effective for me as <br/>
hands-on instruction.<br/>
<br/>
E-mail off line if you're willing to help.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks!!<br/>

<br/>
I'll be teaching a free class to letterboxers in the Houston area,<br/>
early in August.  My free workshop will be about carving your own<br/>
stamps, and making easy handbound logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
My illustrated class notes and handouts will be online (and free) in<br/>
PDF format, around that time.  I know that it's not the same as an<br/>
in-person workshop, but I'll do the best that I can.<br/>
<br/>
I'll post the URL of the free ebook when it's online.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I hope that you find someone in the So. MA area.  Having<br/>
recently moved from that area to Texas, I know that there are many<br/>
talented artists near you.<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>
