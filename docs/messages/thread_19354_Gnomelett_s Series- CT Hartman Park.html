<br/>
We went out to find the Gnomelett's Series today.  The kids, myself <br/>
&amp; some friends set out &amp; easily found box number 1.  It's had some <br/>
water damage &amp; the log books are a bit soggy, but we sealed the bags <br/>
well before we left &amp; hopefully they'll be fine.<br/>
<br/>
Box number 2 was located, but the stamp is missing.  Boo hoo.  We <br/>
stamped in anyway &amp; put the box back (I've contacted the keepers of <br/>
the series, fear not).<br/>
<br/>
We could not locate box number 3, but I think that we stopped a <br/>
little too soon &amp; were looking at the wrong boulders now that I re-<br/>
read the clue from the comfort of my couch.  We'll have to go back &amp; <br/>
search for that one again.  <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to warn you that box number 2 is stampless &amp; remind you <br/>
to seal the baggies when you finish please...especially if the clue <br/>
isn't in a sealable container.<br/>
<br/>
In all a beautiful day for a little hike with the wee ones.  We'll <br/>
be back at it again next weekend!<br/>
