I am new to letterboxing, found 2, hid 1.  Went to check on my box "Sanibel Island Letterbox" today and it wasn't there.  I'm hoping someone had it away from the site stamping and logging in.  I will check on it again tomorrow and if it's not there, I will have to pull it BUT I won't give up.  <br/>
<br/>
This one was very special (and well hidden, I thought) as I had taken 4 friends to it yesterday and they all stamped and signed it.  I didn't get a chance to read what they had individually written so I went back today to read them.  <br/>
<br/>
I will keep you posted.<br/>
