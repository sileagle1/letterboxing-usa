                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last week I went to the California State Fair.<br/>
I took my youngest (she's four) to see Smokey the Bears ranger station, <br/>
while the oldest (she's eight) went to ride roller coasters.<br/>
In a pine grove on the fairgrounds, they set up several (six) buildings.<br/>
each was a differnt fire safety house. (stop drop, roll,) how to dial 911, <br/>
smokeys ranger station, First you got your smokey the bear passport, (a <br/>
small coloring book with a page for each house. In each house there was a <br/>
little presentation. after the presentation you got your smokey the bear <br/>
passport stamped. (the stamps each had to do with the presentation )<br/>
and you went on the next house, If you got all six<br/>
stamps in your passport, you could go get the final stamp (smokey the <br/>
bear)and you got a prize bag with neat stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest came back with a bag full of goodies, a book full of stamps and <br/>
a woodsy owl hat.<br/>
I was right back doing it again with the oldest. Now they want to go letter <br/>
boxing for real....<br/>
<br/>
I need to put up some kids boxes locally.<br/>
