I am excited about scouting this 4000+ acre venue near Mt Rainier.  <br/>
In their e mail they expressed pleasure at being able to introduce <br/>
their site to as many visitors as possible.  Some of the woods are <br/>
classed as Old Growth.<br/>
<br/>
It is my understanding that the site should be available year round.  <br/>
They rarely get snowed out, which is news that amazed me, given their <br/>
proximity to Mt Rainier.<br/>

&gt; Hey Hoopoe, Sun Seeker here!  Pack Forest is in my old stompin' <br/>
grounds!  I was thinking about placing a box on the Hugo Peak trail <br/>
there.  The trail is open year round.  Good job getting permission, <br/>
but sometimes its easier to ask forgiveness than permission!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Isn't it wonderful!  They responded the next day and very <br/>
enthusiasticly too.  I would like to place a few on the shorter loops <br/>
and one out on the long trail.  That would give week day visitors an <br/>
option to use their car and weekend warriors a good stiff hike.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly if you would like to make it a team effort I am open to <br/>
that!<br/>
