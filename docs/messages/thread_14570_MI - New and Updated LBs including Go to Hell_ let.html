I also finished the webpages for the clues to the three boxes I planted<br/>
along the way, two in the UP and one in Hell.  (I still can't believe<br/>
someone hadn't beaten me to placing one in Hell.)  Well anyway, MI<br/>
letterboxers, thanks for all the great boxes around your state and now<br/>
please (with all due respect) Go to Hell!  ;-)<br/>

BTW- I'll be posting the status of the boxes I found or didn't find soon if<br/>
MI people want to know the status of their boxes.<br/>
