	 I feel like I just crawled out from under a rock!  Since my CB <br/>
experience is from the middle 60's (KOD 6603) I have definitely lost<br/>
touch with whats going on. We will have to wait for the future upgrades<br/>
in the wireless realm to allow us to mobile phone through our<br/>
laptops,palms,whatever while on-the-road.  Anyway for what its worth, <br/>
with my Radio Shack Micro CB on channel 22  , I will try  to signal out<br/>
to "letter box land".  Probably a waste ot RF energy! Ha!<br/>
<br/>
Just too cold to be letterboxing here in the Catskills right now!    -5<br/>
degrees last night.  Even a coat for my four legged friend "BUD" is not<br/>
good enough!<br/>
