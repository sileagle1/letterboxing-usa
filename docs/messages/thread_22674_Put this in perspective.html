(Why did I choose to visit this group today -- for the first time in<br/>
several months? Because there was an inordinate number of new<br/>
messages. I just knew that something was going on over here to have<br/>
the message count approaching the traffic on the AP wire after a<br/>
disaster of some kind... turns out it was a five-alarm fire in the<br/>
middle of a damn hurricane. Good grief.)<br/>
