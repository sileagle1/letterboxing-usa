I'm about a week behind in my Lbna mail and just came across this post.<br/>
Does anyone have a copy of the brochure that tells all about shading, texture &amp; shadowing ?<br/>
<br/>
Since I'm in SE Indiana, I won't be able to get to this class. Is there any way I could get one of the brochures?<br/>

The Stamp Studio in Manchester, CT is having a carve your own rubber stamps <br/>
class on August 20th from 6-8 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
In this class, you will learn how to create and transfer images onto rubber <br/>
stamps.  Unlike any other "carve your own" classes, we will cover techniques <br/>
like shadowing, texturing and shading.  It's easy and fun for all levels.  This <br/>
is a great class for those who have discovered letterboxing.  (I did not add <br/>
that... it's in the brochure :-)  Carving rubber will be provided, however, you <br/>
need to bring carving tools if you have them, or purchase them the night of <br/>
the class.  The cost for the class is $22.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions or if you would like to sign up for the class, call <br/>
Melinda at 860-432-1087.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Carving!<br/>
