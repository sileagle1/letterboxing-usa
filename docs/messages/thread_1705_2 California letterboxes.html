                    <div class="plaintext-content">We love letter boxing!  We just discovered this activity, having heard about it from Rotary Int. Magazine article. We visited the 3 boxes in So. Cal, the last one was Point Magu on 1/6/01.  A brutal climb but fabulous view!<br/>
<br/>
While in  the area around Kernville, Ca we placed 2 boxes with easy access. We hope to create more So. Cal. locations.<br/>
<br/>
Bull Run Box, placed December 30, 2000.  In  Kernville, Ca. from Kernville Rd. and Burlando Rd., drive past Forest Service Office 2 miles to Whiskey Flat trail (GPS N 35 deg 46.572, W 118 deg 26.741)  Park in turn out at road's end, and hike down the trail.  At 1/8 mile,  to your right, you will see a barb wire fence, then beyond that a dirt road and beyond that a white fence.  Staying on main trail,  soon  you will come to steepest part.  After this section look for a house to your right at 60 deg. There is a wide trail to your left, but stay on  narrow right hand trail.  Soon you will see Bull Run Creek.  From this spot just where you can see the creek, look back on trail from where you came at 180 deg.  Walk back towards boulder group 29 paces (a 6 ft male pace), take small trail at 270 deg.for 36 paces.  You will see a fish hook shaped dead tree.   Continue 24 paces with the fish hook tree at 180 deg.  Leave trail and look under fallen log laying on west side of fish hook tree.  Move a couple of rocks that are covering the box.  This trail is a popular one on weekends so be discrete when approaching location and move away from site to stamp.  Watch out for snakes, using a stick to locate box.   <br/>
Bull Run Creek, Fish hook GPS N 35 deg 46.973, W 118 deg. 26.890  <br/>

This next box is a 3 season box.  We call it the Anniversary/Western Divide Box, as we placed it on our 37th Anniversary (12/27/00) at one of our favorite spots.  Winter weather brings icy, snowy roads so be careful if this is attempted during the winter!  We suggest use of a Forest Service map of the Lower Sierras.  The location is near the Western Divide Highway and is accessible from via Camp Nelson but we drive up via Kernville, Ca and so the directions are from Kernville.<br/>
