                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I sought out, and indeed did find, Jolly G-Man's "Knowhadamean <br/>
Fern?"  Unfortunately, the box was full of water, the baggies were <br/>
full of water, the log book is a sodden mess, and there was even a <br/>
worm in the box.  The stamp is the only thing that survived.<br/>
I've taken the box away to try to dry it out.  <br/>
<br/>
Jay - When I put the box back, it will have a new log book; the first <br/>
one is full anyway.  Do you want me to put back the first book, too, <br/>
or send it to you?  You can reply off-group.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the info on the box for whoever notates these things on the <br/>
Clues list:<br/>
<br/>
Virginia<br/>
MVT Series - Mt. Vernon - Fairfax Co.<br/>
Knowhadamean Fern?<br/>
Mount Vernon Trail Series #3<br/>
Dyke Marsh Wildlife Habitat<br/>
Belle Haven Park and Marina<br/>
<br/>
I'll let the group know when I've put the repaired box back.<br/>
