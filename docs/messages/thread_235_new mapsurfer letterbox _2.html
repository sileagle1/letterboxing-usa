&gt; A new letterbox is hidden somewhere on Maryland's Eastern Shore.<br/>
&gt; Its sort of with a pirate's treasure map theme.  Map can be found<br/>
&gt; at http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box2.html . Its not as hard as it<br/>
&gt; first appears.  There is some carved Uncle Walter's in it, so we can <br/>
&gt; see how well that holds up :-).  If anyone has trouble accessing the<br/>
&gt; map or the image, e-mail me (warning may be slow).<br/>

This looks like great fun! I grew up in Delaware, and have been <br/>
planning to go to Valley Forge to look for your first box the next <br/>
trip I make that way. Now I have a double incentive!<br/>
<br/>
I think I would have a hard time using the small image of the map on <br/>
your page. Is it possible to get a larger version, or one with better <br/>
resolution. Or is this map really all I ned?<br/>
<br/>
I love the pirate theme! <br/>

That's supposed to be part of the challenge.  Those old maps where just<br/>
as impossible to read :-)<br/>

Your Valley Forge box is doing well.  My boys and I had a great time hunting it (our 1st).  I loved your clues and they were able to figure them a out (except the bearings, I get to do that). The boys (6 &amp; 8) are asking for more, with clues "that are a little more difficult but not too much".  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, I know the way to grow this hobby is for me to put some boxes out there too.  So I'm planning some in the area.  Would you give me the honor of contributing to "50 BY Y2K" by allowing me to be the first to hide a box in Delaware? (Or are you the real competitive kind?) :) <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hunting your second box, now that I've figured out where to go!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for getting this going in PA,<br/>

P.S.: Do you (or anyone else?) know anything about letterboxing in Europe (outside of UK)?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Terribly competetive :-)  (I'm not sure how to make letterboxing competetive<br/>
&gt; unless there is a race to 100 stamps or something.)  To answer your question,<br/>
&gt; I do have one planned from last year for Delaware, but prolly will not get<br/>
&gt; to it 'till mid spring, so I'll give you 2 months head start :-)  Just don't<br/>
&gt; put it where I had planned :)<br/>

Where in Delaware are you thinking of putting a letterbox? (My old <br/>
home state)<br/>
