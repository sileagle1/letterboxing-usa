City?  <br/>

Difficulty 2 <br/>
<br/>
Morels in April are a little taste of heaven.  This letterbox is <br/>
placed right in the midst of one of the best morel patches I have <br/>
found.  A morel hunter will never just tell you where his favorite <br/>
patch can be found.  So you will need to do a little work to find <br/>
this one, and even then you will only be close (to the morels).<br/>
<br/>
The starting point for this hunt is where I have worked as a judge <br/>
with the West District Science Day for the last several years.  It is <br/>
also the building where the Raiders play their basketball games.  <br/>
Begin where you would purchase your admission to a ball game.  You <br/>
can park nearby (when there is not an event) and begin your morel <br/>
hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Put your back to the building and pass the flagpoles on your right.  <br/>
Cross the road and follow the asphalt path along the edge of the <br/>
woods as you head generally west.  Opposite the golden arches turn <br/>
north into the grassy clearing.  At the head of the field, past a <br/>
dam, you will find a sign denoting the woods a biology preserve.  <br/>
Taking a vector of 40 degrees, follow the path along the creek for 2 <br/>
centuries.  Arriving at a three trunked tree, take a course of 80 <br/>
degrees for another quarter century until you arrive at another<br/>
<br/>
The morels are all about if it is the season.  The letterbox is there <br/>
regardless.  For more morels continue to walk about the preserve.<br/>
