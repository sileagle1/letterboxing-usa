Planted March 22, 2003<br/>
by: jessie <br/>
Rated: short easy walk<br/>
Location: Gay City State Park Hebron CT<br/>
<br/>
This box was placed by Jessie in honor of her sister, Small Bear, on <br/>
her birthday. Small Bear got her nickname from her dad many years ago <br/>
because of her love for the Berenstein Bears story books. Small Bear <br/>
is an active letterboxer. From her name most people might think she <br/>
is a young child, but on March 23, 2003 she will turn 21 and will be <br/>
graduating from college in May. Please sign in and write your <br/>
birthday wishes to Small Bear<br/>
<br/>
Gay City State Park is located on Route 85 in Hebron. <br/>
