<br/>
Here are the directions for the first box I placed...<br/>
sadly about a month ago... I'm a college student and<br/>
have been very busy with exams, etc. so this is the<br/>
first chance I've had to put the clues up... sorry!<br/>
<br/>
My brother also placed a box on this trail, so with<br/>
any luck he will send his clues out soon, too.<br/>

&gt; This is a nice place to take a bike ride) Just a<br/>

&gt; far)  Follow Old Colchester Road for 1.8 miles until<br/>
&gt; you see Grayville Rd on your right.  The parking area<br/>

You found a spot I planned to plant one at in the future. How did you <br/>
find out about Grayville Park and the Airline Trail right there? Did <br/>
you read about it in the Courant under Peter Marteka's byline? Or <br/>
have you known about it from before? <br/>
<br/>
I ask because I think an effort to recruit Mr. Marteka would be a <br/>
good thing for the growth of letterboxing. He obviously likes to <br/>
hike. What do we call this? A sport? A recreation? An activity?<br/>

<br/>
I call it a pastime.  I don't call it a sport.  <br/>
<br/>
As both an amateur athlete and letterboxer, I feel the former <br/>
word better captures the cerebral, artistic, laid-back, or <br/>
family-oriented aspects better, while the latter word would <br/>
tend to inappropriately conjure images of competition, rankings, <br/>
training, physical prowess, and the like.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we don't know how it will end up evolving, (and <br/>
sport-like elements are present), but words often do matter.<br/>
<br/>

I have lived nearby for a long time and have taken<br/>
bike rides there for years.  I decided the bridge<br/>
would make a really neat stamp, so I placed it!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Beth, Wonderful job on your first letterbox! I put the clues up on <br/>
the website: click on CT and then Colchester to navigate to them.<br/>
<br/>
I also had the opportunity to blow off a meeting (I HATE meetings!), <br/>
grab my children, and enjoy the hike. Thank you so much for a <br/>
wonderful fall afternoon! I do have a couple of minor suggestions, <br/>
not meant to be critical at all but to help out a little:<br/>
<br/>
-The trail that breaks off into the evergreen cathedral just before <br/>
the second bridge goes "left," not "right." Mind if I edit your clues <br/>
for that minor typo? (We try not to change anybody's clues without <br/>
permission when we post them).<br/>
<br/>
-I think that spot under the bridge by the river is just gorgeous! <br/>
But I also think that there were plenty of signs of high water around <br/>
your letterbox. It might survive the spring better if it was on <br/>
higher ground...maybe in the evergreen cathedral or up on the sides <br/>
of the bridge structure higher?<br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you so much for an absolutely wonderful hike!<br/>

Please feel free to edit my clue- I'm very stressed<br/>
out this week so I didn't catch that mistake while I<br/>
was typing it.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I'll think about moving it to higher ground... I'm not<br/>
sure when/if I'll get a chance in the future, but I'll<br/>
try.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
