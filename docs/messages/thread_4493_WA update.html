Mountain in Issaquah, WA.  (King County)  My helpers were Geek and <br/>
Abigail.  I have these clues up on my website already, but they still need <br/>
a link on the WA page at LbNA.  Here is the link to the clues:<br/>

Thanks for updating the west coast!<br/>

&gt;A thousand apologies to the West Coasters who haven't seen an update<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tom Cooch in VT and I are going to go through and update the CA, OR,<br/>
&gt;and WA pages this week, and we could use your help if figuring out<br/>
&gt;which boxes need links.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If folks could please post, here to the list, with an  "update" tag<br/>
&gt;in the subject line, the:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;box name<br/>
&gt;owner's name<br/>
&gt;date planted<br/>
&gt;city, county, state<br/>
&gt;yahoogroups message number<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;--or--<br/>
&gt;repost the whole clue<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We'll start plugging away at getting things right.<br/>

<br/>
Found Farrell's Marsh in Steilacoom in great shape.  <br/>
<br/>
Checked on Saltar's Point LB in Steilacoom.  Doing well with several <br/>
visitors. <br/>
<br/>
Found Little Happiness LB in Kelsey Creek Park with a few friends <br/>
yesterday.  It's doing well.  Checked on 2 of the 3 other boxes in <br/>
that park and they're doing well.  Couldn't find the 3rd one in the <br/>
series (did find Mischief's and the Horse one--but didn't have the <br/>
clues on me and wasn't able to 're-find' the other one without the <br/>
clues).  For some reason now, I really want to go out for some great <br/>
Dim Sum...  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Found the Bond, James Bond mystery LB.  What an incredible letterbox <br/>
with great clues, nice hike and a great stamp, to boot!!!<br/>
<br/>
Found the Table Mystery with no problem; instantly knew which table <br/>
was referenced in the clues while reading it.  It's such a lonely <br/>
little table these days...  Loved the box--wish I had a great <br/>
workshop...  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Checked on Eliza B's Heart of Lake WA (Mercer Island) a few weeks <br/>
ago and it's doing well.  Several visitors with a few HHs, too!<br/>
<br/>
Found Cougar Mountain LB and it's doing quite well with a few <br/>
visitors well.  If you're looking for a good, hearty workout--that's <br/>
a great hike!  Absolutely gorgeous when the weather's good (which it <br/>
has been lately).<br/>
<br/>
Placed a new LB yesterday but the clues will have to wait until I <br/>
can return home to my own computer.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this update helps some of you with your LB maintenance!  Have a <br/>
great week &amp; keep finding (&amp; placing) those boxes!<br/>
