hunting for my boxes in Wendell State Forest.  Marty, I've tried to reply<br/>
to the email address on your card but I can't get the message to go to that<br/>
address.  I'm pretty sure you read this list though, so here is my reply<br/>
(and my apologies to the rest of the group, although there is a hint here<br/>
for one of my boxes which might interest some).***<br/>
<br/>
Hi Marty!  Got your postcard.  Glad to hear you found the first of my three<br/>
boxes at Wendell State Forest.  The other two are well hidden and require a<br/>
good eye even in summer.  I don't think it would be possible to find them<br/>
when snow is on the ground.  You'll just have to wait for spring or summer!<br/>
<br/>
For the Saint Exupery box, one of the main elements of the clue (hundreds<br/>
of pale fungi on a fallen log) would be completely covered at this time of<br/>
year.  Anyway, since you tried, I'll give you a hint for that box (which is<br/>
the hardest to find for most people):  Recently a sign has been erected on<br/>
the M-M Trail announcing that you are in the "Hidden Forest" (or some such<br/>
name).  When you see that sign back up a few feet and look for the log I<br/>
just mentioned.<br/>
