things are picking up in states other than CT.  The What's New page was a<br/>
great idea.  Nice job!!<br/>
<br/>
Jay thanks for getting the Rock Spring letterbox clues posted they look<br/>
good!  It stinks that there are so many missing letterboxes.  Luckily there<br/>
are still plenty to be found.<br/>
<br/>
Ram- Looking forward to your new 12-part series.  A mystery sounds like a<br/>
lot of fun.  We are always up for a challange!!   Your last box was great.<br/>
We really enjoyed the historical aspect of it.<br/>
<br/>
All the changes to the LBNA site look great!  Thanks to everyone who is<br/>
working hard on it.  Keep up the great work!<br/>
<br/>
Melissa &amp; Dan  in it's finally summer CT<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] What's New?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;In our continuing efforts to improve the site and to make access to<br/>
&gt;Letterboxing information easier, we've put up a kind of reference-<br/>
&gt;page called "What's New?" Until we figure out how we want to link it<br/>
&gt;to the main LBNA page, you can access it directly at:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;www.letterboxing.org/whatsnew.htm<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is just a "beta" version: please don't hesitate to drop any<br/>
&gt;suggestions you have for improving it, spicing it up, and updating it!<br/>
