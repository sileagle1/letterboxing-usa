 I am a graduate student in Anthropology at Colorado State <br/>
 University.  I am studying letterboxing for my thesis topic and was <br/>
 wondering if anyone would be willing to answer a survey about <br/>
 letterboxing for me.  It should only take around five to ten minutes <br/>
 and will help me understand the letterboxing culture from a variety <br/>
 of perspectives.  Please let me know if you would prefer the survey <br/>
 as an attachment or as part of an email.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you for your time<br/>
