In one of my logbooks I used regular copy paper and the ink on some of the<br/>

"chalk" type.  The letterbox container was pretty tight, so I don't think<br/>
moisture was a contributing factor.  The ink dye stamps didn't run or<br/>
fade.  The dry time on pigment inks is probably longer and, if not<br/>
completely dry, I can see that causing a mess.<br/>

I changed my sig stamp this year and I now use a archival ink (sepia<br/>
tone).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Pigment ink dries much slower than dye base inks, which causes smudging.  It is great for card making when embossing - using a heat gun and embossing powders.  Pigment ink comes in a better variety of colors, so I think that's why people use them in letterboxing.  I do put it in my PLBs, because I use a lot of gold and silver.  I figure that when the person stamps in, they can blot it or leave their logbook open until it dries.  That is not so convenient when hiking out in the woods.  <br/>
<br/>
  I always carry several colors of dye base ink with me when I go letterboxing.  If there is pigment ink in the letterbox, I use my own.<br/>

<br/>
Oh, I have a LOT to say on this subject, but remember, it is *ONLY MY <br/>
OWN PERSONAL OPINION!*<br/>
<br/>
I use pigment ink exclusively.  I wish everyone did.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it takes a bit longer to dry.  About 3 or 4 more seconds longer <br/>
than dye based.  Blow on it.  It's worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it can get smudgy.  And the problem is ????<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it bleeds through thin paper.  If I encounter a logbook with thin <br/>
paper, I make sure that I place an index card under the page before <br/>
stamping in and make sure that the image is dry before I close the <br/>
logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it can sometimes give off a pebbly looking image if used on <br/>
textured card stock.  I think it looks cool.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it can clog fine lines on stamps.  That's why I clean the stamp <br/>
after I use it.  Doesn't everyone? (rolls eyes)<br/>
<br/>
Now *WHY* do I wish everyone in the universe used pigment ink?<br/>
<br/>
BECAUSE IF THE LOGBOOK GETS WET, THE IMAGES STAY INTACT.  Any sig <br/>
stamps with dye inks just bleed away.  I've got about 40 or so boxes <br/>
out there, and sometimes they get wet.  I've lost so many precious <br/>
entries because of the prominent use of dye based ink pads.<br/>
<br/>
So that's my experience with pigment ink pads.  I'm strong in my <br/>
*opinions*, but they are my *opinions*.  I don't expect anyone to <br/>
actually read them as *directives*.<br/>
<br/>
YMMV.<br/>

Do you have glossy pages?  Pigment ink never dries when stamped on glossy <br/>

&gt; Yes, it takes a bit longer to dry.  About 3 or 4<br/>
&gt; more seconds longer <br/>
&gt; than dye based.  Blow on it.  It's worth it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, it can get smudgy.  And the problem is ????<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, it bleeds through thin paper.  If I encounter a<br/>
&gt; logbook with thin <br/>
&gt; paper, I make sure that I place an index card under<br/>
&gt; the page before <br/>
&gt; stamping in and make sure that the image is dry<br/>
&gt; before I close the <br/>
&gt; logbook.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, it can sometimes give off a pebbly looking<br/>
&gt; image if used on <br/>
&gt; textured card stock.  I think it looks cool.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, it can clog fine lines on stamps.  That's why I<br/>
&gt; clean the stamp <br/>
&gt; after I use it.  Doesn't everyone? (rolls eyes)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now *WHY* do I wish everyone in the universe used<br/>
&gt; pigment ink?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BECAUSE IF THE LOGBOOK GETS WET, THE IMAGES STAY<br/>
&gt; INTACT.  Any sig <br/>
&gt; stamps with dye inks just bleed away.  I've got<br/>
&gt; about 40 or so boxes <br/>
&gt; out there, and sometimes they get wet.  I've lost so<br/>
&gt; many precious <br/>
&gt; entries because of the prominent use of dye based<br/>
&gt; ink pads.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So that's my experience with pigment ink pads.  I'm<br/>
&gt; strong in my <br/>
&gt; *opinions*, but they are my *opinions*.  I don't<br/>

OK.  However, having found quite a few wet log books<br/>
in my time (especially geocaches), I'd have to say<br/>
that if it gets wet, it's ruined, regardless of<br/>
whether the ink runs or not.  I've found some that<br/>
were a solid mass of wet cellulose, no discernable<br/>
pages.  I suppose if it just gets a LITTLE damp and<br/>
you manage to dry it out, the pigment stamps might<br/>
have an edge.  But it seems as though a log book is<br/>
rarely merely damp; it's usually either dry or<br/>
completely waterlogged.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I love that pigment inks are waterproof, but in Humid Houston, they <br/>
take days and days to dry.  And of course dye inks dry fast but fade.<br/>
<br/>
My alternative when letterboxing is to combine the best of both worlds <br/>
with a hybrid ink.   It is a waterproof dye inkpad.    I use Ancient <br/>
Page (made by clearsnap) but I'm sure there are many other <br/>
manufacturers as well.   The pads come in many bright vibrant colors <br/>
and can be found at most stamping or craft stores.   The package says <br/>
archival quality and it driest lightning fast.   What more can you ask <br/>
for in an inkpad.   (Do put a rubberband around it though when tossing <br/>
it in your pack or the lid will probably come off and your stuff will <br/>
be oh so colorful)<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I tried the hairdryer trick but the cord wouldn't reach far <br/>
enough into the woods. *grin*<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, I think StarSaels and Kirby made some excellent points. <br/>
Having found almost 200 boxes and having planted over 100, I have <br/>
definately learned something.<br/>
<br/>
I am annoyed at people who put bags around the outsides of boxes! It <br/>
just makes the water problem worse. I now use Lock n- Lock containers <br/>
covered with camo tape and hunter green or black plastic spray paint<br/>
(Fusion by Krylon. I use pint size Ziploc freezer bags except for my <br/>
micro boxes. I separately bag the logbook. I no longer provide ink or <br/>
pens in my boxes...unless a specific ink or pen is required, such as my <br/>
Glow-in-The-Dark Box, The Haunting. After having 2 boxes near streams <br/>
being carried away....I no longer hide boxes low along a creek edge. I <br/>
will hide them in a tree or up a slope.<br/>
<br/>
I have found boxes with the logbook double bagged, the stamp double <br/>
bagged, then everything in a bigger outer bag, and then the outer <br/>
container. I think this is overkill. While I am careful to close all <br/>
that stuff up, I wonder if an boxer in a hurry (we all know they are <br/>
out there) would take the time to close all of that stuff? And doesn't <br/>
that negate the whole idea behind all the extra bags? It's one reason I <br/>
switched to the Lock n-Lock...you KNOW when they are <br/>
sealed...no "burping" the edges or other stuff required. They are <br/>
completely air and watertight once closed and they are EASY to close. <br/>
Even children will close them! As for the Ziploc, the freezer style <br/>
bags are easier to close than the regular ones and are thicker to boot. <br/>
They also have an area to write on with a marker. I have been told the <br/>
Zip "tab" style can break and will force people to tear open the bag, <br/>
so I no longer use that type. Basically...make it EASY for boxers to do <br/>
the right thing. Easy to close containers and plenty of hiding material <br/>
nearby.<br/>
<br/>
As for disappearing ink, I have a soaked logbook right here that was <br/>
returned to me. It had been muggled and strewn about, but a few pages <br/>
were recovered. The stamp image from SpudHund was clear as could <br/>
be...while WINK's and Tarheel's signature stamps were <br/>
obliterated....except for the "tar" spot on Tarheel's image. I will <br/>
find out what each of them used.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

Hey Lock Wench,<br/>
<br/>
Never bet your life away on people closing those Lock'n'Lock <br/>
correctly! Yeah, it seems easy, even obvious... BUT...and I kid you <br/>
not, Girl Scout's honor...I found one of Crafty Mouse's boxes with <br/>
the Lock'n'Lock lid latched UP SIDE DOWN!!! Even though we found it <br/>
less than 24 hours later it already had water in it! No harm was done <br/>
since the contents were double bagged but MtnMan and I had to remove <br/>
the seal to dry under it and then reassemble it! I can only surmise <br/>
that the previous boxer had been in a hurry...probably letterboxing <br/>
in the drizzle like we were! Our best defense is still a well sealed <br/>
and even doubled bagged ziplock !!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to shake your faith! I do agree that Lock'n'Locks come the <br/>
closest to fool proof I've seen...provided those latches hold! <br/>
<br/>
Nothing like a good old North Country (NY) winter to put that to test!<br/>

I would never doubt a Girl Scout *grin* ..but despite your <br/>
experience, I will take my chances with the Lock n'Locks. I can't <br/>
believe someone managed to get a lid on upside down!! lol   Mine are <br/>
pretty obvious because the camo tape is on the outside, but...never <br/>
underestimate the one oddball.  In general, I would rather take my <br/>
chances with L &amp; L. I have found almost 200 boxes and I've seen <br/>
multiple Rubbermaids not sealed all the way...screw lids with pine <br/>
needes in the grooves, rendering them useless...lock n lock "rip <br/>
offs" with hinges that don't close all the way.... I'll stick with <br/>
what I know and not worry about the one oddball that can't close a <br/>
Lock n'Lock...and then hedge my bet with Ziploc freezer bags and <br/>
regular maintenance. :)<br/>

<br/>
Don't worry...my faith is not shaken. I have found Lock n'Locks that <br/>
have been hidden through Central NY winters for over two years, and <br/>
have been visited countless times and are still working great! I know <br/>
there are no absolutes...but I'll stick with these until I discover <br/>
something better. <br/>

pretty poor containers.  We had found some boxes with<br/>
bags on them, so we thought it might be a solution to<br/>
protect our boxes better.  As stated before, they are<br/>
pretty useless.  Tearing and trapping water is about<br/>
all that happens.  Fortunately most of these boxes<br/>
have been replaced with boxes that seal better. We<br/>
just go with the camo tape and hope they survive.<br/>
