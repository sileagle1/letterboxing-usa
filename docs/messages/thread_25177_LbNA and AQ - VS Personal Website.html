                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are some advantages to storing your clues on a personal website, but there are some disadvantages, too.  I started out with my own site on Geocities with clues and other letterbox information, but I also posted links to the clues on LBNA so people could find them easier.  Then last year Geocities discontinued free websites and I had to find another host for my website.  I moved all my pictures and letterbox information to the new site, but I decided to post my clues directly on LBNA this time to avoid going through the same process if this host gets discontinued in the future.  The other advantage of posting directly on LBNA or AQ is that your clues should outlive you, assuming future webmasters keep them going.  You can even use HTML and Javascript to dress up your clues in LBNA (maybe AQ, too).  It can be tricky, but I have gotten good results.  About the only thing I no longer have is pictures in my clues, and I could have that if I wanted to store them on my own website.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, if you want your clues accessible to everyone for a long time, I recommend posting them directly on LBNA or AQ or both.<br/>

&gt;If I could do it I would have my clues on my own website but I don't have the skill for that - I use AQ to list my boxes, that is a service it provides but I also list them on LBNA.  &gt;<br/>
