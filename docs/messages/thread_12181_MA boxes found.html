in Dover and Milton, MA.<br/>
<br/>
A Tree For All Seasons: Spring at Chase Woodlands in Dover is in <br/>
place, dry, and intact.  While the log is by no means empty, we're <br/>
surprised more people haven't hunted up this sequential series.<br/>
<br/>
We bit off a little more than we could chew with TeamGreenDragon's <br/>
Time Travels series in Milton's Blue Hill Reservation, but we feel <br/>
four out of the six is a respectable haul.  The hand-carved stamps <br/>
are awesome, and if Brian doesn't submit some of his work for the <br/>
Smithsonian collection, we'll... well, we'll pout!<br/>
<br/>
We got Weena, Time Traveler's Return, Into The Future, and Back To <br/>
The Lab, in that order.  All were in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
We also set the Happy Trails Hitchhiker free... somewhere.<br/>
