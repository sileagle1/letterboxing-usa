"Catch up" with the rest of your friends.<br/>

Catch Up Letterbox<br/>
Brooklyn, CT<br/>
<br/>
Rating:Very easy, one very small hill.<br/>
Good for any age from 5-75.<br/>
Need compass for one reading.<br/>
Time:15 minutes round trip<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From route 6 or 169 in Brooklyn center, take road in front<br/>
of Town Hall and Heirloom Antiques. (Wolf Den Road) The Green will be on<br/>
your left. After passing Costello Dr. on your right, turn on your left<br/>
signal. The Extension Service is right there. Park in the rear.<br/>
<br/>
The metal gate marked "Stewiship Forest" is your starting point. <br/>
Walk on Road straight behind it. <br/>
Before the field take road at 250' to the right.<br/>
At the T with another road continue on the same straight path.<br/>
You will go up a hill. The field and wall will be on your left.<br/>
Then white pines on your right.<br/>
Watch for stone walls which are history of a cattle farm.<br/>
When the stone walls on your left form a T, start looking for an opening<br/>
in the wall.<br/>
Count 18 single foot falls to another break.<br/>
10 Guards will be watching over your prize in the wall.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the map origionally made for this area are no longer<br/>
valid, so you must turn around and trace your steps back to your<br/>
vehicle.<br/>
