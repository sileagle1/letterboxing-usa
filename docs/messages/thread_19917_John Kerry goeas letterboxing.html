While campaiging in Portland, OR, Democratic Presidential candidate<br/>
John Kerry took some time off the campaign trail to hit some local<br/>
hiking trails to pursue some letterboxing, a hobby he recently read<br/>
about in TIME magazine. While on the trails, Kerry happened on a<br/>
local letterboxing celebrity who calls herself Funhog. After giving<br/>
Kerry a ride on her Harley-Davidson motorcycle, Funhog pressed the<br/>
democrat on the National Parks System's letterboxing and geocaching<br/>
policy. Kerry promised that if elected he would work to ensure<br/>
letterboxing would be allowed and that the penalty for geocaching<br/>
will be elevated to a federal capital offense. Getting back to the<br/>
trails, Kerry was particularly pleased to have found a "hitchhiker"<br/>
in one of the boxes. This hitchiker, Rosie Ruiz, is apparently in a<br/>
race of her own, attempting to travel from Los Angeles to NYC. Said <br/>
Kerry, "I wish Rosie well in her pursuit. I was unable to help her <br/>
move much towards her goal, but to help her as best as I can, I made <br/>
sure to leave the Boss Hogg letterbox I moved her to well out in the <br/>
open to ease finding the box by the next hunter."<br/>
