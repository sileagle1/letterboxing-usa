&gt; There is a term "the ugly american" (this has nothing<br/>
&gt; to do with the war or anything like that).  It refers<br/>
&gt; to the way that many US citizens act when traveling. <br/>
&gt; We have a reputation among international travelers as<br/>
&gt; people who take little regard for local customs,<br/>
&gt; language etc. and expect everything to be as easy for<br/>
&gt; them as it is in the states.  <br/>
<br/>
Amen. Of course I would not speak to the Dartmoor group not honoring <br/>
any stamps NOT found at Dartmoor. I think we have some antecedents <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Difficult clues or not, letterboxes are placed so that<br/>
&gt; they can be found.  If I go around placing boxes in<br/>
&gt; the most remote areas I can find with clues that are<br/>
&gt; over cryptic and no one finds them.  <br/>
<br/>
Remote and overly cryptic seem to be matters of perspective. Cases in <br/>
point, Ryan Carpenter's placements and my latest response. What he <br/>
considers easy terrain (height gain of 650 ft) darned near kills me. <br/>
Okay, I am horizontally gifted with a bad knee. Now those stamps he <br/>
places are well worth getting. A couple of them are carved by Amanda <br/>
from Seattle and are gems. The reward is there. <br/>
<br/>
Ryan also put out a box called Walking Tour, where we had to go from <br/>
plaque to plaque in downtown San Luis. At each place we had to go <br/>
down so many lines, over so many words, and then in so many letters <br/>
to decipher the clues. It was truly something for a Hardy Boys or <br/>
Nancy Drew fan to decrypt. The stamp was nice but it was really an <br/>
accomplishment solving it. Yep, we got mad because some of the first <br/>
words were misspelled, leaving us to doubt our methods. Oh well. We <br/>
got the box in the end.<br/>
<br/>
What I really and truly hate are vague or misleading clues. And clue <br/>
writers, everyone writes them that way at first. You have to go along <br/>
with someone or a couple separate folks who have not been to the box <br/>
and watch them try to puzzle the clues out. Some folks who write <br/>
clues honestly do not know their right from left. Play testing clues <br/>
and then refining them might be something we all try occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my response to Ryan? The Middle Earth series <br/>
(http://webpages.charter.net/astroweaver/letterboxing/middle.html) I <br/>
am planting has clues written in Morse code, Tolkein Elven runes, <br/>
Ogham, Masonic code, Braille, Futhark, and (maybe) in Tengwar. I do <br/>
give help with the Elven runes because they are hard to find in <br/>
letter by letter decryption. I have had members of Googled (our <br/>
boxing group here in SLO county) not cut in on the plants. I want to <br/>
watch them decrypt and find the things. Are my clues too vague? Heck, <br/>
I want the clues to be something to work for but not vague. <br/>
<br/>
All of my boxes, however, are easily gotten to. Most are wheelchair <br/>
accessible. And "Return of the King" is a tribute to and a spoof of <br/>
Ryan. The clues will be planted in his "Walking Tour" box. And while <br/>
he has Amanda carving some, I have an equally gifted JugglerMouse <br/>
carving some of mine.<br/>
<br/>
And in foreign countries like Kuwait planting boxes? Hmmm. Might be <br/>
interesting but being a Vietnam vet, I would worry about landmines in <br/>
some of these vacation parts. And in paranoid countries, these look <br/>
awfully like dead-drops for spies. Hopefully our new Czar <br/>
of "Homeland Security" won't think that! <br/>
<br/>
BTW, who is this guy putting spam up in our files and links areas? <br/>
Can we do something to him? Maybe that came out wrong; maybe it <br/>
didn't.<br/>
<br/>
Keep on boxing out there,<br/>
