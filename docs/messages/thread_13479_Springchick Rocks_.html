My sentiments exactly! WOW! What a nice surprise when I got my <br/>
snailmail today! Thanks! Springchick, you DO rock! Since I frame alot <br/>
of stamp art, and this one is definitely to-be-framed, I'm trying to <br/>
decide which side of the "card" to display since they both have <br/>
fabulous carvings. <br/>
