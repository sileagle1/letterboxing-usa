Today three friends went out and planted three letterboxes on a three <br/>
mile lollypop hike.<br/>
We trudged through the snow , slipping and sliding not able to wait for <br/>
the promise of a<br/>
meltdown. Please add to the hiding places if the letterboxes are peeking <br/>
out when the<br/>
snow melts.<br/>
Place: Middletown , CT<br/>
Planted March 9, 2003<br/>
By the three : Bluebird, Lobsta lady and Butterfly.<br/>
Rated ; moderate with a few short climbs.<br/>
Boxes by Butterfly<br/>
<br/>
Hills , Rocks and Trees, Oh My!<br/>
. The stamp is a three part stamp with a few letters on the top edge of <br/>
each stamp. When<br/>
all boxes are found the picture and word is the name of this hike. Each <br/>
log book has the<br/>
completed stamp image for you to see..<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From Middletown or Old Saybrook-take Route 9 to exit # 10. <br/>
At the end of<br/>
the ramp turn left [north] on Route 154. At .07 miles turn onto Dripps <br/>
Road [gravel].<br/>
Immediately the road bends and the entrance to this hike is at a gate on <br/>
the left. Park at<br/>
the gate or continue up to a small parking space on the right.<br/>
Back at the gate, the trail follows a white blaze.<br/>
At the top of an easy climb, the road/trail levels out and leads East. <br/>
Watch for a Spur trail<br/>
on the right leading out to an overlook.Take this short spur trail to a <br/>
great rock outcrop of<br/>
feldspar and quartz . Stand there and then face North to notice several <br/>
cedar trees and a<br/>
large rock on the East side of the trail. The first letterbox SPI is <br/>
in a home made cave<br/>
built by Bluebird and Lobsta Lady on the North East side of that large <br/>
rock by the cedar<br/>
trees. Add a rock if you wish.!<br/>
Return to the main trail and head East again. Notice massive rock <br/>
outcrops. Now the trail<br/>
goes down hill beneath a series of parallel ledges. Cross a stream dry <br/>
only in summer.<br/>
Travel along stone walls , and this same road once continued to the CT. <br/>
River.<br/>
Watch for the double blaze that indicates the loop trail. Continue now <br/>
to follow in a<br/>
counter clockwise direction , taking the right way. The forest is <br/>
awesome here at all<br/>
seasons. The tulip trees are huge and soon you come to a four sister one <br/>
, stop and then<br/>
count 10 steps along the trail and look on the south side of the stone <br/>
wall. The Letterbox<br/>
DER lives behind a large trap door. Careful not to move or remove <br/>
stones in the wall.<br/>
The trail soon climbs steeply through rock outcrops and mountain laurel, <br/>
blooming here<br/>
in May. What is that just ahead?? Another four sister Tulip tree !! With <br/>
your back to the<br/>
tree, return back on the trail 8 steps , then turn south and take 8 more <br/>
steps to a very<br/>
young tree in 2003 ! Letterbox  WEED is hiding in the base of the tree <br/>
behind a trap<br/>
door.<br/>
Now if you have stamped all the letters from the top side of each stamp, <br/>
you have the<br/>
name of your hike.<br/>
Continue on the white blaze trail and soon reach the beginning of the <br/>
loop. Keep right<br/>
and follow the white blazes back to your car.<br/>
Have a great hike.<br/>
