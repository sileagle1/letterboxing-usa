off I was going to plant a hitch hiker and i lost my stamp! <br/>
I still had a great time , that was the best trail system I have been to<br/>
yet and I had a blast . I went 260 from the gazebo and 80  plus 6 for our<br/>
dec. and without 6<br/>
i was sure i found the spot also. but like I said it sure was fun<br/>
looking,<br/>
