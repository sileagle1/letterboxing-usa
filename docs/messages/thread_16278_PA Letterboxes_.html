Why?  It was reading an article about letterboxing that got me started, and I <br/>
don't think I'm the wrong crowd. <g>  People can't start boxing if they don't <br/>
know about it.  And I suspect if they're not the right kind of person for <br/>
boxing, it won't pique their interest even if they read an article about it.<br/>

<br/>
Seriously, I think a well-done article would be nice, especially if thsi is<br/>
an area that needs more letterboxers--emphasizing the need to respect the<br/>
environment, use discretion, familiarize oneself with the hobby and the<br/>
conventions before crashing through the brush....<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, even planting a box specifically for the article, much as some are<br/>
doing for the Scouts.<br/>

topics raised and belabored that might cause you to think you are. But <br/>
.... when the subject line is about a topic that, in your mind, has been <br/>
carried too far, you have the choice of deleting that/those message(s) <br/>
unopened. One benefit to this is that you won't glare at your screen and <br/>
go Grrrrrr! as often.<br/>

 If you treat boxing as an adventure, each box as a treasure placed or <br/>
found, and an opportunity to interact with your kids and have fun, it <br/>
should be enjoyable for all of you.<br/>

<br/>
Of course!  "We're the people our parents warned us about!" <g><br/>
<br/>
Sorry.  I couldn't resist.<br/>
<br/>
I can see both sides, here.  The more publicity the hobby gets, the more <br/>
likely that some cretin with no respect will barge in with nothing but destruction <br/>
on his/her mind.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm infinitely grateful for the article in Family Fun, without which, I <br/>
may never have discovered letterboxing.  Can I really deny someone else that <br/>
same chance?<br/>
<br/>
There are some parts of the country (I live in one) which pretty much won't <br/>
have letterboxing to speak of, unless we get some "new blood," and it's a <br/>
really slow process to do it by word of mouth.<br/>
