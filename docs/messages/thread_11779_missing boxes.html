I'm not sure if this is where I report missing boxes.<br/>

In Northern Virginia (Fairfax), we couldn't locate  "Get into the Game" or<br/>

I checked the Thompson Creek and Botanical Gardens boxes this morning.<br/>
The good news is the Botanical Gardens is there and in great <br/>
condition. I was shocked to see the area around the Thompson Creek <br/>
Box. Being as it was near homes I didn't think it would be damaged, <br/>
but the fire went right up to the back yard fences of these homes. <br/>
The sycamore Canyon box is probably gone, as that whole area is <br/>
burned, but the fence was closed to traffic so will have to wait <br/>
until someone can get up there to see.<br/>
We did find the plastic bag for the Thompson Creek box. It was just <br/>
sitting there without any sign of fire on it. The immediate area <br/>
where this box had been was not burned or scorched, so maybe it was <br/>
disturbed when they tried to put out the fire. These fireman did a <br/>
magnificent job. Purple Iris<br/>

While most letterboxers would agree with what you have said and in general, most letterboxers do try to keep up with their boxes, it is not always possible to stay on top of everything -- once you have planted your own boxes, you will understand this.<br/>
<br/>
Missing boxes (and blisters) are a part of letterboxing -- the sooner you can accept that and find other ways to derive satisfaction from a letterbox outing other than *just* the stamp, the more enjoyable you will find the hobby to be.  You mentioned you found 6 boxes today -- that's not a bad day and I hope you had a great time with those finds.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've debated whether to address any of your comments more <br/>
specifically and decided that I will.<br/>
<br/>
1. How do you know that the placers do not check their boxes? Not <br/>
expecting a reply, just trying to draw your attention to an <br/>
assumption on your part. I for one check on mine when my "real life" <br/>
allows me time to.<br/>
<br/>
2. If you don't find a box, don't automatically decide it must be <br/>
missing. There is such a thing as "newbie error". This comes through <br/>
misinterpreting clues, misreading compass headings, etc. It's up to <br/>
you to contact the placer, give as much info as possible about where <br/>
you were and where you thought the box should be. Leave it up to the <br/>
placer to let you know whether you were in the right spot IF they <br/>
care to.<br/>
<br/>
3. Fact: Some placers may not acknowledge e-mails about box <br/>
conditions. That's their way of playing the game. There are no rules <br/>
in letterboxing other than rehiding well, basically. If they can <br/>
tell that you were completely off in the directions, they might give <br/>
you a gentle hint--or they might not, and that's OK too.<br/>
<br/>
4. Your kids were looking forward to a nice family time. Did they <br/>
get it? Did they have fun anyway???? That's a heck of a lot more <br/>
important to me than finding the box. When you didn't find the box, <br/>
did YOUR disappointment color their experience? So often the way we <br/>
react influences the way our kids respond. If you show you are <br/>
disappointed, they will show the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
5. You found 6 out of 10. That's 60%. A baseball player would love <br/>
to have that average. It's all in how you look at it. You can see <br/>
the lemons or see the potential lemonade.<br/>
<br/>
This got a bit long and I'm not trying to flame you or anything. <br/>
It's just before you go further into letterboxing you may need to <br/>
figure out just what you want out of it. If you expect to find every <br/>
box every time, you're likely to be disappointed. If you want to see <br/>
fun, new places with your family and maybe find a box or two on the <br/>
way, then welcome to the addiction. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

It seems you've had some preconceived ideas and assumptions about<br/>

blisters heal.  It really is a great hobby with the right attitude.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, but...... if you're going to keep letterboxing, well, this is  <br/>
part of the game. The box may have been missing for just a few hours  <br/>
after being dragged away by a curious squirrel or it may even be that  <br/>
the searcher looked in the wrong place (happens a lot) - or it may  <br/>
have been missing for ages and not reported or a hundred other  <br/>
things. The first time DD and I went boxing, we drove 40 minutes out  <br/>
to a state park and didn't find the box. We looked and looked and re- <br/>
interpreted the clues several times in case we'd gotten them wrong  <br/>
the first time through, going over the same ground several times. No  <br/>
luck. DD and I had a quick talk about how letterboxing is about the  <br/>
journey and that we'd had a nice walk in a beautiful place and that  <br/>
was a great day. That was almost 3 years ago when she was just 6 and  <br/>
even now, when I sound a little frustrated at not finding a box, she  <br/>
reminds me that it's all about the walk and the together time. I do  <br/>
the same for her and it's all good. Sun, rain, finds, no-finds..... I  <br/>
can't think of a single time we went letterboxing that either of us  <br/>
would describe as a negative experience.<br/>
<br/>
Finding the box is great. It can even feel like "The Point" of  <br/>
letterboxing. However, not finding a box is a great teaching moment  <br/>
and having a good attitude towards the outings that don't result in a  <br/>
Find is a great way to enjoy the activity long term and get in some  <br/>
great family time. Most kids will get it when the time you spend  <br/>
hunting also lets them check out a new flower, watch a salamander  <br/>
skitter away, skip rocks, talk to Mom about what's on their mind, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If it's not for you, it's not for you. No biggie. If it is for you,  <br/>
have fun and we'll see you out there! :-)<br/>

<br/>
First... Let me join with Spring Chick in giving you a warm Welcome <br/>
to Letterboxing.  and yes, it can be tough in the beginning... but <br/>
it does get easier! You will be a pro in no time.... <br/>
second.... "Duck!"... this particular forum is not<br/>
tolerant of newcomers complaining without doing some research first. <br/>
This is a national forum. You should find a group forum in your home <br/>
state or near your home town... the local groups will be sure to <br/>
help you get started...  third... Check the placement date! After <br/>
you gain some experience you will get a feel for which boxes are <br/>
likely to be alive and well and which are unreliable. With time... <br/>
you will become familiar with the conventions of hiding and clue <br/>
writing... your success rate will be 80 ... 90 even 100 % most days <br/>
you go out... and you will find yourself mentoring a newcomer a year <br/>
or so from now!<br/>
<br/>
I taught myself how to letterbox too. I went searching four<br/>
different days before I finally found my first letterbox. I was<br/>
furious that the bad clues I followed were posted by someone who had<br/>
become inactive and really didn't care that the letterboxes were<br/>
long gone. Finally I saw a post that someone just reported finding a<br/>
series of boxes in a park I knew... well I ran right out and found<br/>
them too... now I try to be first finder<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">1.  You might want to join the newboxer list at yahoogroups;<br/>
<br/>
2.  Possibly consider dropping the all-caps shouting -- you're generally<br/>
preaching to the choir here -- if placers care enough to belong to and read<br/>
this list, they probably also care enough to attempt to maintain their<br/>
boxes;<br/>
<br/>
3.  No placer is responsible for your children having a good time -- as a<br/>
parent, I would consider it *your* responsibility to make sure your children<br/>
get something out of the experience even if they don't find the pot of gold<br/>
at the end of the rainbow;<br/>
<br/>
4.  The box might not be missing -- you may have misread the clues, someone<br/>
else may have found the box and taken it to another area to stamp in when<br/>
you came along to search for it, etc.<br/>
<br/>
5.  A lot of boxes are placed by people who don't live near the area of the<br/>
box and they rely on people contacting them if something about the box is<br/>
amiss;<br/>
<br/>
6.  The box may have been alive &amp; well even up to a hour before you went<br/>
looking for it and then some muggle came along and found it and made off<br/>
with it or an animal decided to make off with it, etc.<br/>
<br/>
7.  6 outta 10 ain't really all that bad.  I just went out the other day and<br/>
found 4 out of 7 and didn't consider *that* too bad at all either.  Two of<br/>
them I couldn't figure out a way to get to because of the rains we've had<br/>
here because I didn't think to drag a boat along with me :-) and another one<br/>
had clues so vague and generic that I just plain threw in the towel and gave<br/>
up.  But I still considered it a verrry good day because I'm the only one<br/>
responsible for making my time a fun time.  Every single time I go out, I<br/>
either always learn something about the area or the history of the area, or<br/>
I learn something about myself.  The time is never wasted.<br/>
<br/>
It's not a bad idea to check the date and location before you set out<br/>
searching.  The older the box or the more urban or more popular the<br/>
environment where it's placed, the more likely it is that the box might be<br/>
missing.  Or you can always try contacting the placer a few days *before*<br/>
you set out searching to inquire about when the box was last found or last<br/>
checked.  Some placers will answer you, some won't.  But if your family's<br/>
time is valuable, you can restrict your search to those boxes where the<br/>
placer has replied to you affirming that the box has been recently found or<br/>
recently checked.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are many folks who would be happy if they could have 10 sets of clues<br/>
to look for in their area on their first day out, and would consider it<br/>
golden to have found six.  You are so much luckier than many, many boxers to<br/>
have had the opportunity to search for ten in one day!<br/>
<br/>
Your post makes it sound as if you think letterboxers are careless,<br/>
thoughtless folk, and we aren't.  The vast majority of us are quite the<br/>
opposite.<br/>
<br/>
Many of us box with kids (or physical or mental handicaps, or unbearable<br/>
schedules, or financial hardships, or legal woes, or ...) and we all<br/>
understand your frustration, but we learn lessons from the disappointments<br/>
that are inevitable in letterboxing.  Some of those lessons are:  1) we<br/>
don't always get what we want, 2) how we do something is often more<br/>
important than what we get out of it, 3) empathy - "I really hate having to<br/>
tell joe boxer his box is missing because he is going to be disappointed".<br/>
What a great opportunity to teach these same lessons to your kids - in<br/>
something that, in the grand scheme of things, doesn't change their world!<br/>
<br/>
Further, rather than accusing planters of being irresponsible in not keeping<br/>
clues updated, thank them for taking the time, money, and energy to plant on<br/>
your and other finders' behalf.  True, you may not have found the box - and<br/>
that could be for a variety of reasons, not all related to the planter's<br/>
ineptitude - but thank them for the journey and their willingness to offer<br/>
it to you.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, before you make judgments, participate with us.  Letterboxing<br/>
is not an "Us against Them" type of game - it's a cooperative game in many,<br/>
many respects.  It is also not a game you learn in one day.  Take the time<br/>
to get to know it, and you will understand that while your comments in many<br/>
respects are quite correct, the tone and implication behind them are not.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you will stick with letterboxing, and I hope your blisters heal<br/>
quickly.<br/>

<br/>
We haven't been boxing long, but we got into it for the adventure and <br/>
to spend time together as a family.<br/>
<br/>
We have come across missing boxes as well as non-missing boxes.<br/>
<br/>
We found a box that all thought was missing, but the park put in a <br/>
new trail.  There is no way a placer would know that, and this placer <br/>
received several notices about being missing.  We knew this park like <br/>
the back of our hand and thought there was no way the clues <br/>
conected.  We went were we thought it would end up and surprise there <br/>
it was - not the fought of the placer, just a change in the lay of <br/>
the land.  The placer was happy it was found and we are giving him <br/>
the info so he may update his clues.<br/>
<br/>
The second non-missing box was actually there, but another boxer was <br/>
on cruches moved up the trail to sit and stamp, and arrived back as <br/>
we were rereading the clues for a 5th time.<br/>
<br/>
If you come across a "missing" box come back another time and look <br/>
again.  Your mind will be clearer and you may find it.  If not try <br/>
contacting the placer.  Some are more than happy to give extra clues <br/>
if there are any. Some don't want their boxes to go missing since we <br/>
wouldn't see their beautiful work.  Others as stated earlier, it's <br/>
part of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Don't give up, take a deep breath and smell that wonderful Autumn air <br/>
and remember, children are only little once, make the most of it!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">chilichirpysmommy welcome to letterboxing! I read your post and <br/>
thought back to when my family first started letterboxing.  We went <br/>
and looked for the same box 3 different times.  After the first and <br/>
second time I was SURE the box was missing.  I contacted the placer <br/>
after each time and she reassured me each time that the box was still <br/>
there.  We started to look for the box in Oct. '04 tried again in <br/>
Jan. '05 and finally found the bugger in April.  What was the <br/>
problem? Each time we had been there previously due to leaf cover, we <br/>
could not find the path she was referring to on top of a waterfall.  <br/>
So we basically kept moving forward looking for an area where the <br/>
ground opened up into crevices and had a island in between.  <br/>
Unfortunately, those were all over this area.  Pluse I had a pre-set <br/>
idea in my mind where I thought it was.  When we finally found the <br/>
path, and followed the clues, that lead us to the island with the <br/>
box, my preset idea wasn't even close.  So as you can see, sometimes <br/>
not findng the box is due to a problem with the hunt.  <br/>
<br/>
I also found it ironic that your post showed up the same day my post <br/>
about adopting a box.  I had gone into the letterboxing basement and <br/>
found clues for boxes that are assumed abandoned and purpously set <br/>
out to find them expecting them to be missing.  I set out with the <br/>
idea of hey, if I do find them, its like a bonus! These boxes were <br/>
not listed on letterboxing.org or atlasquest.com.  As it turned out <br/>
one was still there, one was missing.  While walking back through the <br/>
woods with my husband, both of up pondering about the box we couldn't <br/>
locate we had the most beautiful deer step out onto the path in front <br/>
of us.  She stopped, we stopped, we stood and looked at each other <br/>
for a minute and she walked on her way.  I wouldn't trade that moment <br/>
for anything.  So even though we were leaving empty handed because of <br/>
no box, we were still rewarded by nature.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally, and I'm trying to think of how to ask this in a way that is <br/>
not confrontational.  Being brand new, please ask yourself this <br/>
question.  Did my family make sure that we re-hide the boxes as well <br/>
or BETTER then we found them?  Are we sure that the 6 our 10 boxes we <br/>
found will not be discovered by non boxers?  If you can honestly <br/>
answer yes to that question then you're doing a great job.  If you <br/>
can't answer yes, then please adjust your habits before you scold the <br/>
habits of others.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree here.  I have 5 kids and pregnant with #6, and we go out with my parents one day over the weekend. (My kids ages are 11, 9, 8, 5, and 15mos) The kids love going, and we try to hit one area and get as many as we can.  Some may take only 15-20 min, some may take almost 2 hours!!!  Yes, the kids get tired, so do I, but we believe determination helps.  We usually try to email the person if we can't find the box just to be sure we were inthe right area.  Sometimes we find out we got turned around, or that we didn't go far enough down a path.  We enjoy letterboxing very much, and times we get discouraged when we can't find a box, but the kids always tell us, there's another one we can try to find next.  They look at it as finding a "buried treasure", and I guess if we don't find it, they think someone else found it before us and took it without sharing.  LOL  We just started in July 2006, and we have lots of fun.  I wouldn't give up.  My mom got poison ivy on one trip,<br/>
 she went to the doctor, got medicine for it, and was out the next weekend looking for more!!! My mom also faced alot of fears on letterboxing as well.  He HATES snakes, and we've come across at least 1/2 dozen so far, baby ones, and she goes on. There was one where she had to cross over a bridge over the interstate, 6 lanes long, and she's scared of heights, but she did it!!!  She has fits on the 2nd floor of a mall and she walked this bridge.  Dad said she was whie as a ghost when they got done, but she was determined to get that box!!! =)  <br/>

          I usually stay away from responding, but I just have to say "are you<br/>
kidding?" You found 6 out of 10 boxes today and you feel disappointed or<br/>
cheated? Is you glass always half empty, or do you rejoice in it being<br/>
half full (or 60% full)?<br/>
<br/>
It seems you've had some preconceived ideas and assumptions about<br/>
letterboxing. I would encourage you to take a deep breath and let your<br/>
blisters heal. It really is a great hobby with the right attitude.<br/>

&gt; Yes, but...... if you're going to keep letterboxing, well, this is  <br/>
&gt; part of the game. The box may have been missing for just a few <br/>
hours  <br/>
&gt; after being dragged away by a curious squirrel or it may even be <br/>
that  <br/>
&gt; the searcher looked in the wrong place (happens a lot) - or it may  <br/>
&gt; have been missing for ages and not reported or a hundred other  <br/>
&gt; things. The first time DD and I went boxing, we drove 40 minutes <br/>
out  <br/>
&gt; to a state park and didn't find the box. We looked and looked and <br/>
re- <br/>
&gt; interpreted the clues several times in case we'd gotten them wrong  <br/>
&gt; the first time through, going over the same ground several times. <br/>
No  <br/>
&gt; luck. DD and I had a quick talk about how letterboxing is about <br/>
the  <br/>
&gt; journey and that we'd had a nice walk in a beautiful place and <br/>
that  <br/>
&gt; was a great day. That was almost 3 years ago when she was just 6 <br/>
and  <br/>
&gt; even now, when I sound a little frustrated at not finding a box, <br/>
she  <br/>
&gt; reminds me that it's all about the walk and the together time. I <br/>
do  <br/>
&gt; the same for her and it's all good. Sun, rain, finds, no-finds..... <br/>
I  <br/>
&gt; can't think of a single time we went letterboxing that either of <br/>
us  <br/>
&gt; would describe as a negative experience.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finding the box is great. It can even feel like "The Point" of  <br/>
&gt; letterboxing. However, not finding a box is a great teaching <br/>
moment  <br/>
&gt; and having a good attitude towards the outings that don't result in <br/>
a  <br/>
&gt; Find is a great way to enjoy the activity long term and get in <br/>
some  <br/>
&gt; great family time. Most kids will get it when the time you spend  <br/>
&gt; hunting also lets them check out a new flower, watch a salamander  <br/>
&gt; skitter away, skip rocks, talk to Mom about what's on their mind, <br/>
etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If it's not for you, it's not for you. No biggie. If it is for <br/>
you,  <br/>
&gt; have fun and we'll see you out there! :-)<br/>

&gt; hey..we DID find salamanders..i thought they wouldve been gone by <br/>
now..we DID have fun..no-one seems to get that..Im not going to stop <br/>

When ever caps are used in a post it comes across as yelling. I would <br/>
suggest that whenever you think that you need to write everything in <br/>
caps. you take a breath, relax, and go to a tutorial such as the one <br/>
Ryan has at AQ.<br/>

posters mean much to you now but if you continue with it you will come to know them. It <br/>
helps to have a strong ego here. Everyone here was a newbie and onetime and alot of first <br/>
posts don't seem to go well. I had my delicate little feelings stomped on a few times but <br/>
here I am.<br/>
To comment to your original post as counterintuitive as it is for some of us it's not about <br/>
the box anymore.I don't even count anymore. We here in the mid-atlantic region are <br/>
reeling from the loss of a young boxer and as we come together during this time of <br/>
tragedy we realize what boxing has brought to our lives. There is a community here that <br/>
includes people I have never even met but I feel a conection to them though boxes they <br/>
have placed and log enteries in my boxes.<br/>
I hope you'll give it a chance to become a part of you life.<br/>

   I hope I didn't come across as judging you or critizing your venting.  I can understand about getting frustrated over not finding a box.  I was just letting you know we all have been there, and still there at times.  =)  <br/>

<br/>
I wasn't the one who was venting.  That's was chilisomebodysmommy or<br/>
something or other.  With 3000 people on this list, I can't begin to imagine<br/>
what the list might be like if everyone decided to vent after a "bad" day.<br/>
:-)  Everybody who didn't have a bad day suddenly *would* be having a bad<br/>
day.  An awful day.<br/>
<br/>
If she was legit tho, it's a shame tho that she didn't stick around to share<br/>
some of her *positive* experiences.  I did myself proud today.  The other<br/>
day I only managed to find 4 out of 7.  But I headed out to St. Charles, IL<br/>
today and actually managed to find 4 outta 4.    YES!  Some very nice<br/>
stamps.  And the fall colors along the Fox River were amazing.<br/>
Unfortunately, Elmer the not-always-so-bright Coonhound decided to go for a<br/>
swim in the Fox River when we were looking for Nuts4Mice's "Wonder Where the<br/>
Rabbits Went" box and I was playing with him and not-always-so-bright me<br/>
ended up falling in myself.  So we left a little bit wetter than we arrived.<br/>

There is a very good life lesson in this you know.  Sometimes you may <br/>
try something and be met with failure, but if you are persistant you <br/>
will eventually succeed.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot begin to tell you how many boxes I have failed to find, be it <br/>
they were missing or I simply missed them.  Last summer I visited <br/>
Seattle and went for a series of 10 boxes.  I found only two of them. <br/>
They were very nice stamps, and I am sorry I did not find the rest, but <br/>
I was happy to have tried, the park was beautiful, and I was out in it, <br/>
and that alone made it worth it.  It is all what you take from it.<br/>

Have you tried geocaching?  You may enjoy that hobby more than <br/>
letterboxing as there is often more current 'feedback' on caches <br/>
that are out in the wild.  Check it out at www.geocaching.com<br/>
