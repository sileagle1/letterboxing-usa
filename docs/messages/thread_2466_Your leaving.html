<br/>
I may continue to pursue it occasionally.  It's really putting out the<br/>
letterboxes that involves the risk I'm referring to.  I don't mind taking<br/>
physical risks myself.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the  encouragement.<br/>

Subject: Your leaving<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sad to see you go. In the context of everything that has occurred<br/>
&gt; since letterboxing got started in the US, the heat you received for<br/>
&gt; bringing up issues people didn't want to face was not that bad. Trust<br/>
&gt; me on this, I have been the center of some very heated issues in the<br/>
&gt; history of letterboxing in the US. Unfortunately some people get way<br/>
&gt; too defensive when someone has views that differ from their own. Your<br/>
&gt; concerns are, IMHO, valid and ones I have publicly discussed from the<br/>
&gt; first days of letterboxing. Hopefully you may come back for the value<br/>
&gt; of the recreation and learn to ignore those who don't know how to<br/>
&gt; "agree to disagree" without making it personal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here's an example similar to the recent situation. You can find my<br/>
&gt; post about it last fall if you are interested. I went to Tenn for<br/>
&gt; vacation and hoped to find some boxes. The only one close to me was<br/>
&gt; maxpatch and I read the clues and decided to go after it with the<br/>
&gt; wife. Turns out the 8 mile "logging" road was an extremely narrow<br/>
&gt; winding path along the side of the mountains with no shoulders and<br/>
&gt; sides that dropped to certain death if any mistakes were made.<br/>
&gt; Because of my desire to find this one box near my vacation area I<br/>
&gt; drove about 1 mile up the mountain before coming to my senses and<br/>
&gt; managed to find a place I could turn around. It had rained the night<br/>
&gt; before for the first time in weeks and the tire tracks in the path<br/>
&gt; had turned from dirt to a slippery mud. I was very nervous until I<br/>
&gt; reached the bottom.  It was in my opinion extremely dangerous and I<br/>
&gt; posted about it.<br/>
