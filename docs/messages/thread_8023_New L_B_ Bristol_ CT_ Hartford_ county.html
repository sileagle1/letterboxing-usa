planted 9-27-02 by Rubaduc<br/>
pretty easy..maybe an hour<br/>
<br/>
This box is planted as a tribute to my summer letterboxing companion, my<br/>
grandson Will. <br/>
Thank you, Will for all the good times.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet William (according to Webster) is a biennial plant having bracteate<br/>
heads of brightly colored flowers.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From Rt.6 in Bristol turn East onto Hill St. go 0.8 mi. to<br/>
James P. Casey Rd. and go right. After 0.6 mi. you'll see the Chippens<br/>
Hill Middle School on your left and shortly on your right, a parking<br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
 Clues: From your car walk down the paved road till you come to a path on<br/>
the right, follow this through an open meadow, watching the hill in front<br/>
of you. There are several trails leading up the hill but you want the one<br/>
furthest to the left (you will have to cut across the grass to achieve<br/>
this). At the top, at the tree line there's a white blazed trail going<br/>
both ways, follow it to your right. This area is known as "The Hoppers"<br/>
because of the "kettle holes" left 12,000 years ago during the ice age.<br/>
As the ice receded over the gravel ground, it left huge depressions<br/>
called hoppers, which  you can see on both sides of the trail as you<br/>
start walking into the woods. Staying on the white trail the whole way<br/>
you'll soon see a blue trail enter and join the white for awhile. Going<br/>
down a sandy slope you'll see a white arrow pointing right as the blue<br/>
leaves us. Some of this area has been devastated by motorized vehicles,<br/>
but used to be beautiful hiking trails, I did scare up a deer however.<br/>
After a while you can start looking for a cement marker close to the<br/>
ground on your right. X marks the spot (almost) from this marker count<br/>
off 20 steps and find a path on your left. 15 steps down this path leads<br/>
you to a small, fallen tree and at it's base you'll find the Sweet<br/>
William plant. Stamp in, rehide carefully and return to the path. Just<br/>
ahead is a pretty decent overlook with some houses below but I'd suggest<br/>
returning the way you came unless you know the area. When I got back to<br/>
the blue trail I took that straight ahead and came out to the same<br/>
hilltop but took a different path down.<br/>
