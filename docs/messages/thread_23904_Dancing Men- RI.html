This is my all-time favorite box!!  Finding the box has definitely been the<br/>
highlight of my boxing career. <br/>
<br/>
Part of  that satisfaction came from solving it.  It is definitely one of<br/>
those clues where all becomes clear-eventually.  I encourage you to<br/>
persevere; it is well worth it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also encourage anyone who might be inclined to give hints etc. to do so<br/>
off-list so as not to accidentally spoil it for others on the quest.<br/>

We have just started into the realm of torture known as Dancing Men. <br/>
We solved the cryptogram, but those of you who have already solved it,<br/>
knows it doesn't do much. Can anyone here tell us something? We are<br/>
