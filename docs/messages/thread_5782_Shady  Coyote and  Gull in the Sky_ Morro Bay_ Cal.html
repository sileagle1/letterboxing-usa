Placed by Don and Gwen on June 6, 2002 at Montana de Oro on the Bluff Walk,<br/>
(San Luis Obispo County).  Easy level hike, (no dogs). <br/>
<br/>
Near Spooner's Cove and the Visitor's Center at the start of the Bluff Trail look for a cluster of Eucalyptus trees off to your left in the distance towards the ocean.<br/>
Take the trail along the Bluffs until you reach the trail near Corallina Cove<br/>
that heads east to the small Eucalyptus grove. Follow the cove trail away from the ocean until you come to what appears to be a single  Cypress tree but upon closer inspection is actually 2 Cypress trees.  Enter the canopy of the tree nearest the trail and you will see a Y shaped branch hugging the ground heading west towards the ocean.  The Y branch is about 3 feet from the tree trunk. The Shady Coyote box is under the Y and under some movable rocks, sticks and tree duff.  Be careful poking around and be discrete in the area as the trail gets heavy use.<br/>
