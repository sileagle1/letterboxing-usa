                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well Sneaky Armadillo consider it kicked softly. In your post you mentioned the location of a letterbox . This area is policed by the NPS and they have specific rules against letterboxes. I'm not sure that this box is still available if it is the one with the location in the title(Our son had one in that location and it was confiscated some time ago) Please consider what info is put in chat list posts as the placer may  not want it posted. Putting some information on the list can put some letterboxes at risk.<br/>
