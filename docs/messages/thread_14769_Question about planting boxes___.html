1) As far as public places, if it is a open park type of place, then, in my not so humble opinion, no. If it is a park where there are rangers and such, then I would check with them first so they don't think there's a bomb or something there.<br/>
<br/>
2) Register at the website from the member services page and when registered, you are then able to add/edit your boxes from there.<br/>

  *This message was transferred with a trial version of CommuniGate(tm) Pro* do you have to ask permission to plant a box somewhere if it's a <br/>
  public place?  We've thought of a place to plant a box, but wanted to <br/>
  make sure it's ok.<br/>
<br/>
  Also, how does one get clues posted on the letterboxing site once a <br/>
  box is planted?  <br/>
