There is no better time to visit New England than the<br/>
fall. Foliage in Vermont starts in early September,<br/>
and is over by early October. The daytime weather can<br/>
sometimes get a little below 60, but not by much. All<br/>
of the parks are worth visiting, but the ones in the<br/>
Green Mountains, along the western edge of the state,<br/>
are among the best.<br/>

Gifford Woods State Park in Killington is also very nice.  We've been there twice and planted a box in July!<br/>

You probably want to go during the summer months, last time at Jamaica it got quite cold.  Of course that was in October!  It was quite a beautiful time to be there though!<br/>

We're trying a new one this October, Quechee State Park.  We've never camped there but we've driven through.<br/>

If you need phone numbers email me off list and I'll be happy to help you out.<br/>

<br/>
We own a second home in West Dover, VT and would suggest a ziplock bag<br/>
around the plastic container for the letterbox. Last winter brought huge<br/>
amounts of snow and the extra protection couldn't hurt! Sue &amp; I just<br/>
planted our first series in West Dover on the Valley Trail near Mount<br/>
Snow. If you are in the area, check it out.<br/>
<br/>
Townshend Dam in Townshend, VT is a great facility and home to 2 [1 is<br/>
missing]boxes. Grout's Pond near Stratton Mountain has great trails and<br/>
is a beautiful wildife area. Sue &amp; I canoe there and hope to plant some<br/>
boxes there in the near future. Another great spot is Harriman's<br/>
Reservoir/Lake Whittingham which is located just south of Wilmington, VT<br/>
center. <br/>
<br/>
If you need help with maintaining these boxes that you plant, email me<br/>
offline. We are up there often and I would be glad to help.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
