On Sunday, I planted der Lacamas Creek Letterbox in Camas, WA (just 12 miles <br/>
east of Vancouver, WA). Expect more of der boxes to appear in this area soon. <br/>
Meanwhile, clues for this one can be found at this URL....<br/>

<br/>
Monday, I climbed to Council Crest, der highest perch in Portland. It was a <br/>
mild, clear, sunny day, and I could see everything from Mt. Ranier to Mt. <br/>
Jefferson. I planted two new boxes: der Marquam Trail Letterbox and der <br/>
Council Crest Letterbox. Clues for both are at this URL....<br/>
<br/>
http://members.aol.com/letterboxr/usa/marquam.htm<br/>
<br/>
The latter of these two was one of those where der planter of der box ALMOST <br/>
deserves credit for a F(ind), as well as a P :-)   It's as if our friend <br/>
upstairs has already provided der ideal spot to hide der blasted thing, but <br/>
we gotta go out and find it.... and we don't even have any clues ta go by!!!  <br/>
I wandered around for over an hour looking for the perfect spot to hide der <br/>
box at Council Crest. Wouldn't I be surprised if one of these days I reached <br/>
my hand under a rock and discovered that God had already left a letterbox <br/>
waiting there for me :-)<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
