are interested.<br/>
<br/>
This one is themed as "a salute to Valentines day" ... it's <br/>
not "adult" in the naughty way, but it probably wouldn't be of much <br/>
interest to our younger members (who already have 3 VLb's sort of <br/>
aimed for them in this series) <br/>
<br/>
This one is "stand alone" ... meaning you don't need to have solved <br/>
any of the other VLb's in the series to complete this one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One additonal thing I need to note for those doing the series.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry to change the rules in the middle of things, but there are <br/>
so many participants that I'm going to suspend sending the <br/>
individual 'virtual stamps' for logbooks. Instead, we're going <br/>
to "PLAN B".<br/>
<br/>
I will upload all of the 'virtual stamps' to the Picture Trail site <br/>
in a locked album.  When all 10 of the series has been posted, I <br/>
will unlock the album and you can download the 'virtual stamps' of <br/>
the VLb's in the series which you've completed.  <br/>
<br/>
I shall continue updating the Honor Roll pages for all of the boxes, <br/>
just as I have been doing. (Whatever you sign your email with, is <br/>
what I copy and paste to the Honor Roll)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
