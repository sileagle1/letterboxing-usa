NAME:  Double NINE (Eye No Your Wandering)<br/>
       Third Box in the Nolde Forest Series<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION:  Nolde Forrest Environmental Education Center, located on<br/>
           PA Route 625 south of Reading, Berks County, PA.<br/>
<br/>
DATE PLANTED: October 2002<br/>
<br/>
Nolde Forest Environmental Education Center is designed and <br/>
maintained to promote environmental education.  Bicycles and <br/>
motorized vehicles are not allowed. Please hike only on designated <br/>
trails. All route choices use existing Fire Roads, Trails, or Paths <br/>
(FR/T/P).  All boxes in this series are located close to trailsides. <br/>
All routes involve elevation changes. Maps of the center are not <br/>
entirely accurate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
START HERE:  From the location of Double Eight, return to the point<br/>
(P). In this area locate a wooden structure and a water source. Stand <br/>
facing the water source so that the wooden structure is directly <br/>
behind it. Head right, following this named (FR/T/P) through the rows <br/>
of Double Pines to a water source on the right. Locate and note the <br/>
Heading of the Double Outlets (HDO) at the base. Continue on the same <br/>
named (FR/T/P) until it meets another. Zig right, zag left, and <br/>
continue on the same named (FR/T/P) passing the Laurel PP on your <br/>
left, until you reach some macadam. Follow a heading of 40 degrees to <br/>
a stone structure. Find a sign of --TT--  --SS  --FF-TT and then <br/>
find --TT--  --SS  --FF-TT above a clock.  Note the number of the <br/>
hour hand (NHH) on the clock. Stand with the clock at your back and <br/>
note the heading(CH). Go from nearby brass to nearby shiny silver, <br/>
then 205 degrees to an area where   -cC-NN-LL --LL is at 300 degrees, <br/>
shiny silver is at 40 degrees, and a light post is at 280 degrees. <br/>
Follow heading 160 degrees to a (FR/T/P) entrance on the right <br/>
located before EE 15 and across from a water source. Follow this <br/>
(FR/T/P), ignoring both the first (FR/T/P) coming in on the right and <br/>
the next coming in on the left until you reach a Y. Go left until <br/>
this (FR/T/P) crosses another at an X. Go left, almost DOUBLING Back, <br/>
and continue to Netless (Nt) standing on the left. From (Nt), follow <br/>
heading CH for (six times NHH) paces, then follow heading HDO for <br/>
(three times NHH) paces to Double Nine.<br/>
