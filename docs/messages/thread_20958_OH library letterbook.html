We are currently working on creating a letterbook to plant in our library.  <br/>
Our thoughts are to leave clues throughout the library leading to a hollowed <br/>
out book on the shelves.  One question is what kind of luck/experience have <br/>
people had with hollowing out books.  Inside the hollow, we would have the <br/>
log, stamp, and ink pad, pencil, whatever.  How would you keep the contents <br/>
from falling out when being pulled off the shelf?<br/>
 Second question... does anyone have experience in library programs <br/>
explaining letterboxing.  We are planning one for March/April to teach the <br/>
history of letterboxing and how to do it.  We will then have a craft to <br/>
create a stamp, practice orienteering/pacing, etc. and then set them loose <br/>
on our letterbook and also a box we will plant outdoors near the library.  <br/>
Our target audience is 4-6 grades, but we may have an adult session in the <br/>
evening.  We are already developing a powerpoint presentation and want to <br/>
include examples.  We are trying not to divulge too much information that <br/>
would give the example boxes away, but we want to give enough info in order <br/>
to teach.  How much is too much (flyfisher, in particular)?<br/>
 Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to get this all in one post rather <br/>
than several.<br/>
Thanks for any help,<br/>

Scoutdogs has a very nice letterbook in the Harrison Library in Harrison OH.<br/>
You can find the clues under the box of that name (Harrison Library) in the<br/>
Southwest OHio/hamilton County listings.  She has also  developed some very<br/>
nice brochures for presentation and would probably share if you contacted<br/>
her.  Also, a search on topics such as  "letterboxing and scouting" should<br/>
turn up some good threads on this.  I know the topic has been discussed<br/>
before!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and keep us posted.<br/>

You can also contact greenowl -- who might have some ideas -- check the Indiana boxes.<br/>
