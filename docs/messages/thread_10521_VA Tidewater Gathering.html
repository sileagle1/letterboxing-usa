<div><span class="570310218-30012003">I'd like that, but I only know 4 letterboxers in Tidewater, VA. 
I'd be happy to sponsor a kayak trip to find my NC box. Do you think folks would 
like to rent boats for that? Maybe I'll have planted kayakers boxes in VB and 
Norfolk by the time we could arrange a gathering. I must be very honest though 
and say that I cannot be an organizer of the entire event. I can show up with a 
trailerload of boats somewhere, but I am unable to be the major contact for the 
gathering. Your thoughts? How many locals are there?

<p>Time:<span>  </span>3-4 hours by bike, 
    round trip, with stops<br/>Location: Virginia Beach, VA<br/>Difficulty: 
    Serious walk; fun, easy bike ride.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>You won’t have to work on Maggie’s Farm no more…</p>
<p>If you follow Maggie’s Family . . . . .<span>  </span>to the shore.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Our first box we’ve stashed in a beautiful place,</p>
<p>Where people are scarce, yes, hardly a trace.</p>
<p>It’s not easy to get to, in fact quite a hike,</p>
<p>So may we suggest that you dust off your bike.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Load up the car and head “Back” to the “Bay,”</p>
<p>You’ll pass through the “bridge” of “Sand” on your way.</p>
<p>Follow Sandpiper south to the Refuge gate,</p>
<p>When you get to the Station, there’s no need to wait.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>You’ll see lots of birds, and horses, and maybe a wild 
    boar,</p>
<p>So pay the five dollars and be glad it’s not more.</p>
<p>Unload all the bikes and start down the path.</p>
<p>You’ve got four miles to go, because we did the math.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Take your water, your camera, your lunch, and embark,</p>
<p>Go down the main path and head for the park.</p>
<p>You’ll come to a fork, both trails well-traveled.</p>
<p>But go left on East Dike; we hope you’re not baffled.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And whatever you do, don’t take the Dune Trail,</p>
<p>You’ll end up on the beach and you will have failed.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>You’ll pass by a sign with a date and a duck.</p>
<p>You may think it’s there, but oh, no such luck!</p>
<p>We hid it there first, but we did all agree,</p>
<p>It was too easy to find, and there’s much more to see!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Peddle on to the park and don’t miss the boat,</p>
<p>Veer to the left and be sure to take note.</p>
<p>You’ll come to a platform, “22” it is marked,</p>
<p>Stop for a rest, you’ll be glad that you parked.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Soon you’ll be at the Station, in a moment or so,</p>
<p>It’s quite clean and tidy in case you’ve “Got to GO!”</p>
<p>You’ll see a small shop and tables (if you’ve brought something to 
    eat)</p>
<p>Inside’s a nice man who we think you should meet.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Look all around at this blissful location,</p>
<p>It’s a nice place to camp should you be on vacation.</p>
<p>But since you’re on a real quest, turn left at the sign,</p>
<p>That reads, “Ocean/Beach Camp.” You’re close to the find!!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Past the ramp on the left (but what is it for?)</p>
<p>NO! Don’t turn right to Washwoods - keep on to the shore.</p>
<p>The trail’s a bit sandy. It’s a little hard going,</p>
<p>We saw horses there -- their manes all aglowing.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>When you get to the walkway (it’s wooden) just park,</p>
<p>Time to walk a ways now… so get on your mark.</p>
<p>Step on to the planks and count out your paces,</p>
<p>Fifty, sixty, or more if you wear little shoelaces.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Pass “Delicate Dunes” and glance right for our riddle,</p>
<p>You’ll see some bushes with a dead branch in the middle.</p>
<p>Reach down in the sea grass, but look ‘fore you grab,</p>
<p>You’ll discover our prize, and we hope not a crab!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Now once you’ve “stamped in” you can do what you likes,</p>
<p>But may we suggest that you get back on your bikes.</p>
<p>Head over the dunes, and we hope it’s low tide.</p>
<p>Because if it is you are in for a ride!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And even if the tide is a little bit high,</p>
<p>Just follow the beach with the ocean right by.</p>
<p>It’s a beautiful site, unspoiled, like a myth,</p>
<p>Must have looked much the same to Capt. John Smith.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Head back whence you came and try not to roam,</p>
<p>NOW take the Dune Trail and find your way home.</p>
<p>So ends your adventure. The day is now done.</p>
<p>Good luck on your next quest. We hope you’ve had 
    fun.</p></div><br/><br/><tt>To unsubscribe:

<div></div>&gt;You may think its there, but oh, no such luck! 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;We hid it there first, but we did all agree, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;It was too easy to find, and theres much more to see! 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Peddle on to the park and dont miss the boat, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Veer to the left and be sure to take note. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Youll come to a platform, 22 it is marked, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Stop for a rest, youll be glad that you parked. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Soon youll be at the Station, in a moment or so, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Its quite clean and tidy in case youve Got to GO! 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Youll see a small shop and tables (if youve brought something to eat) 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Insides a nice man who we think you should meet. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Look all around at this blissful location, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Its a nice place to camp should you be on vacation. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;But since youre on a real quest, turn left at the sign, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;That reads, Ocean/Beach Camp. Youre close to the find!! 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Past the ramp on the left (but what is it for?) 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;NO! Dont turn right to Washwoods - keep on to the shore. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;The trails a bit sandy. Its a little hard going, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;We saw horses there -- their manes all aglowing. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;When you get to the walkway (its wooden) just park, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Time to walk a ways now so get on your mark. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Step on to the planks and count out your paces, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Fifty, sixty, or more if you wear little shoelaces. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Pass Delicate Dunes and glance right for our riddle, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Youll see some bushes with a dead branch in the middle. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Reach down in the sea grass, but look fore you grab, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Youll discover our prize, and we hope not a crab! 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Now once youve stamped in you can do what you likes, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;But may we suggest that you get back on your bikes. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Head over the dunes, and we hope its low tide. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Because if it is you are in for a ride! 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;And even if the tide is a little bit high, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Just follow the beach with the ocean right by. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Its a beautiful site, unspoiled, like a myth, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Must have looked much the same to Capt. John Smith. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Head back whence you came and try not to roam, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;NOW take the Dune Trail and find your way home. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;So ends your adventure. The day is now done. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Good luck on your next quest. We hope youve had fun.

  <div></div>&gt;I'd like that, but I only know 4 letterboxers in Tidewater, VA. 
  I'd be 
  <div></div>&gt;happy to sponsor a kayak trip to find my NC box. Do you think 
  folks 
  <div></div>&gt;would like to rent boats for that? Maybe I'll have planted 
  kayakers 
  <div></div>&gt;boxes in VB and Norfolk by the time we could arrange a 
  gathering. I must 
  <div></div>&gt;be very honest though and say that I cannot be an organizer of 
  the 
  <div></div>&gt;entire event. I can show up with a trailerload of boats 
  somewhere, but I 
  <div></div>&gt;am unable to be the major contact for the gathering. Your 
  thoughts? How 
  <div></div>&gt;many locals are there?

  <div></div>&gt;I also checked out your website and thought it was great too. I 
  live in 
  <div></div>&gt;Norfolk. Maybe all the locals should start thinking about a 
  gathering 
  <div></div>&gt;here in Tidewater. I think that there's a bunch of us here. 
  What do you

  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Hello Trish, 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;My family is new to Letterboxing and planted our first box in 
  Virginia 
  <div></div>&gt;Beach 
  <div></div>&gt;last September. It then took us until early December to get the 
  Poem 
  <div></div>&gt;written and up on the site. But I am afraid it has gotten lost. 
  It 
  <div></div>&gt;actually showed up on the What's New page for awhile but has 
  now 
  <div></div>&gt;disappeared 
  <div></div>&gt;(or at least I cannot find it). Then, when I saw your e-mail 
  that the 
  <div></div>&gt;VA 
  <div></div>&gt;webpage had been updated, I didn't see it. So I am afraid the 
  clue 
  <div></div>&gt;itself 
  <div></div>&gt;has disappeared - hope the box is still there. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;I am attaching the original e-mail with the clues. Since then, 
  I have 
  <div></div>&gt;placed it in a webpage at http://mysite.verizon.net/vze2jt4p/ - 
  can you 
  <div></div>&gt;put 
  <div></div>&gt;it into the webpage the next time you update and, since it does 
  not 
  <div></div>&gt;appear 
  <div></div>&gt;in What's New, should I republish it in the Group as if it was 
  new? We 
  <div></div>&gt;will 
  <div></div>&gt;publish a second one this spring and will place it in the web 
  page as 
  <div></div>&gt;well 
  <div></div>&gt;as that seems to work best. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Lastly, do you have a background called "scroll.gif" that I can 
  have to 
  <div></div>&gt;use 
  <div></div>&gt;a the background for the clues on the page? 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Many questions - thanks for your help.

  <div></div>&gt; &gt; The VA webpages have been updated. I have created 
  "master" webpages 
  <div></div>&gt; &gt; for some of those who place boxes in VA. If you would 
  like a single

  <div></div>&gt;This is our first box posting and I hope we've done it right. 
  We 
  <div></div>&gt;probably will add more boxes so you could call the page

  <div></div>&gt;Date Placed: 09/16/02 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Time: 3-4 hours by bike, round trip, with stops 
  <div></div>&gt;Location: Virginia Beach, VA 
  <div></div>&gt;Difficulty: Serious walk; fun, easy bike ride. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;You won’t have to work on Maggie’s Farm no more… 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;If you follow Maggie’s Family . . . . . to the shore. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Our first box we’ve stashed in a beautiful place, 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Where people are scarce, yes, hardly a trace. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;It’s not easy to get to, in fact quite a hike, 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;So may we suggest that you dust off your bike. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Load up the car and head “Back” to the “Bay,” 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;You’ll pass through the “bridge” of “Sand” on your way. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Follow Sandpiper south to the Refuge gate, 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;When you get to the Station, there’s no need to wait. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;You’ll see lots of birds, and horses, and maybe a wild boar, 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;So pay the five dollars and be glad it’s not more. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Unload all the bikes and start down the path. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;You’ve got four miles to go, because we did the math. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Take your water, your camera, your lunch, and embark, 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Go down the main path and head for the park. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;You’ll come to a fork, both trails well-traveled. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;But go left on East Dike; we hope you’re not baffled. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;And whatever you do, don’t take the Dune Trail, 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;You’ll end up on the beach and you will have failed. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;You’ll pass by a sign with a date and a duck. 
  <div></div>&gt;

&gt; I also checked out your website and thought it was great too. I <br/>
live in<br/>
&gt; Norfolk. Maybe all the locals should start thinking about a <br/>
gathering<br/>
&gt; here in Tidewater. I think that there's a bunch of us here. What do <br/>
you<br/>

&gt; Hello Trish,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My family is new to Letterboxing and planted our first box in <br/>
Virginia<br/>
&gt; Beach<br/>
&gt; last September.  It then took us until early December to get the <br/>
Poem<br/>
&gt; written and up on the site.  But I am afraid it has gotten lost.  It<br/>
&gt; actually showed up on the What's New page for awhile but has now<br/>
&gt; disappeared<br/>
&gt; (or at least I cannot find it).  Then, when I saw your e-mail that <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; VA<br/>
&gt; webpage had been updated, I didn't see it.  So I am afraid the clue<br/>
&gt; itself<br/>
&gt; has disappeared - hope the box is still there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am attaching the original e-mail with the clues.  Since then, I <br/>
have<br/>
&gt; placed it in a webpage at http://mysite.verizon.net/vze2jt4p/ - can <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; put<br/>
&gt; it into the webpage the next time you update and, since it does not<br/>
&gt; appear<br/>
&gt; in What's New, should I republish it in the Group as if it was <br/>
new?  We<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; publish a second one this spring and will place it in the web page <br/>
as<br/>
&gt; well<br/>
&gt; as that seems to work best.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lastly, do you have a background called "scroll.gif" that I can <br/>
have to<br/>
&gt; use<br/>
&gt; a the background for the clues on the page?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many questions - thanks for your help.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The VA webpages have been updated.  I have created "master" <br/>
webpages<br/>
&gt; &gt; for some of those who place boxes in VA.  If you would like a <br/>
single<br/>

the<br/>

&gt; Webmaster:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is our first box posting and I hope we've done it right.  We<br/>
&gt; probably will add more boxes so you could call the page Maggie's<br/>
&gt; Family's Boxes or something like that.  Here we go.  Thanks.<br/>

&gt; Placed By:  Maggie's Family<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; E-mail:  <mailto:maggies.family@v...> maggies.family@v... <br/>
&gt; Date Placed: 09/16/02<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Time:  3-4 hours by bike, round trip, with stops<br/>
&gt; Location: Virginia Beach, VA<br/>
&gt; Difficulty: Serious walk; fun, easy bike ride.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You won't have to work on Maggie's Farm no more<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you follow Maggie's Family . . . . .  to the shore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Our first box we've stashed in a beautiful place,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where people are scarce, yes, hardly a trace.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's not easy to get to, in fact quite a hike,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So may we suggest that you dust off your bike.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Load up the car and head "Back" to the "Bay,"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You'll pass through the "bridge" of "Sand" on your way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Follow Sandpiper south to the Refuge gate,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you get to the Station, there's no need to wait.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You'll see lots of birds, and horses, and maybe a wild boar,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So pay the five dollars and be glad it's not more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unload all the bikes and start down the path.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You've got four miles to go, because we did the math.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take your water, your camera, your lunch, and embark,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Go down the main path and head for the park.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You'll come to a fork, both trails well-traveled.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But go left on East Dike; we hope you're not baffled.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And whatever you do, don't take the Dune Trail,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You'll end up on the beach and you will have failed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You'll pass by a sign with a date and a duck.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You may think it's there, but oh, no such luck!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We hid it there first, but we did all agree,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was too easy to find, and there's much more to see!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Peddle on to the park and don't miss the boat,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Veer to the left and be sure to take note.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You'll come to a platform, "22" it is marked,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Stop for a rest, you'll be glad that you parked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Soon you'll be at the Station, in a moment or so,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's quite clean and tidy in case you've "Got to GO!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You'll see a small shop and tables (if you've brought something to <br/>
eat)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Inside's a nice man who we think you should meet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Look all around at this blissful location,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's a nice place to camp should you be on vacation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But since you're on a real quest, turn left at the sign,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That reads, "Ocean/Beach Camp." You're close to the find!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Past the ramp on the left (but what is it for?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; NO! Don't turn right to Washwoods - keep on to the shore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The trail's a bit sandy. It's a little hard going,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We saw horses there -- their manes all aglowing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you get to the walkway (it's wooden) just park,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Time to walk a ways now so get on your mark.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Step on to the planks and count out your paces,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fifty, sixty, or more if you wear little shoelaces.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pass "Delicate Dunes" and glance right for our riddle,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You'll see some bushes with a dead branch in the middle.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Reach down in the sea grass, but look `fore you grab,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You'll discover our prize, and we hope not a crab!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now once you've "stamped in" you can do what you likes,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But may we suggest that you get back on your bikes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Head over the dunes, and we hope it's low tide.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because if it is you are in for a ride!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And even if the tide is a little bit high,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just follow the beach with the ocean right by.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's a beautiful site, unspoiled, like a myth,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Must have looked much the same to Capt. John Smith.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Head back whence you came and try not to roam,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; NOW take the Dune Trail and find your way home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So ends your adventure. The day is now done.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck on your next quest. We hope you've had fun.<br/>

  Station, there's no need to wait.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  You'll see lots of birds, and horses, and maybe a wild boar,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  So pay the five dollars and be glad it's not more.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Unload all 
  the bikes and start down the path.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; You've got four miles to 
  go, because we did the math.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Take 
  your water, your camera, your lunch, and embark,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Go down the 
  main path and head for the park.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; You'll come to a fork, both 
  trails well-traveled.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; But go left on East Dike; we hope 
  you're not baffled.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; And whatever you 
  do, don't take the Dune Trail,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; You'll end up on the beach and 
  you will have failed.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; You'll pass by 
  a sign with a date and a duck.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; You may think it's there, but 
  oh, no such luck!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We hid it there first, but we did all 
  agree,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It was too easy to find, and there's much more to 
  see!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Peddle on to the park and don't 
  miss the boat,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Veer to the left and be sure to take 
  note.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; You'll come to a platform, "22" it is marked,<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; Stop for a rest, you'll be glad that you parked.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Soon you'll be at the Station, in a moment or 
  so,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It's quite clean and tidy in case you've "Got to 
  GO!"<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; You'll see a small shop and tables (if you've brought 
  something to <br/>eat)<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Inside's a nice man who we think you 
  should meet.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Look all around at this 
  blissful location,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It's a nice place to camp should you be on 
  vacation.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; But since you're on a real quest, turn left at the 
  sign,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; That reads, "Ocean/Beach Camp." You're close to the 
  find!!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Past the ramp on the left (but 
  what is it for?)<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; NO! Don't turn right to Washwoods - keep on 
  to the shore.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The trail's a bit sandy. It's a little hard 
  going,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We saw horses there -- their manes all 
  aglowing.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; When you get to the walkway 
  (it's wooden) just park,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Time to walk a ways now… so get on 
  your mark.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Step on to the planks and count out your 
  paces,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Fifty, sixty, or more if you wear little 
  shoelaces.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Pass "Delicate Dunes" and 
  glance right for our riddle,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; You'll see some bushes with a 
  dead branch in the middle.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Reach down in the sea grass, but 
  look `fore you grab,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; You'll discover our prize, and we hope 
  not a crab!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Now once you've "stamped 
  in" you can do what you likes,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; But may we suggest that you 
  get back on your bikes.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Head over the dunes, and we hope it's 
  low tide.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Because if it is you are in for a ride!<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; And even if the tide is a little bit 
  high,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Just follow the beach with the ocean right by.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; It's a beautiful site, unspoiled, like a myth,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Must 
  have looked much the same to Capt. John Smith.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; Head back whence you came and try not to roam,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; NOW 
  take the Dune Trail and find your way home.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; So ends your 
  adventure. The day is now done.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Good luck on your next quest.

  I'd be happy to sponsor a kayak trip to find my NC box. Do you think folks 
  would like to rent boats for that? Maybe I'll have planted kayakers boxes in 
  VB and Norfolk by the time we could arrange a gathering. I must be very honest 
  though and say that I cannot be an organizer of the entire event. I can show 
  up with a trailerload of boats somewhere, but I am unable to be the major 
  contact for the gathering. Your thoughts? How many locals are there?

<p>I also checked out your website and thought it was great too. I live in

    in Tidewater. I think that there's a bunch of us here. What do you think?

you'd drive all the way to go kayaking and letterboxing? I definitely have to 
get busy and hide some more boating boxes. Come on down! I'll add you to the

<div><span class="570310218-30012003">I'd like that, but I only know 4 letterboxers in Tidewater, 
    VA. I'd be happy to sponsor a kayak trip to find my NC box. Do you think 
    folks would like to rent boats for that? Maybe I'll have planted kayakers 
    boxes in VB and Norfolk by the time we could arrange a gathering. I must be 
    very honest though and say that I cannot be an organizer of the entire 
    event. I can show up with a trailerload of boats somewhere, but I am unable

<p>I also checked out your website and thought it was great too. I live in 
      Norfolk. Maybe all the locals should start thinking about a gathering here 
      in Tidewater. I think that there's a bunch of us here. What do you think?

        Trish,<br/><br/>My family is new to Letterboxing and planted our first box 
        in Virginia Beach<br/>last September.  It then took us until early 
        December to get the Poem<br/>written and up on the site.  But I am 
        afraid it has gotten lost.  It<br/>actually showed up on the What's 
        New page for awhile but has now disappeared<br/>(or at least I cannot 
        find it).  Then, when I saw your e-mail that the VA<br/>webpage had 
        been updated, I didn't see it.  So I am afraid the clue 
        itself<br/>has disappeared - hope the box is still there.<br/><br/>I am 
        attaching the original e-mail with the clues.  Since then, I 
        have<br/>placed it in a webpage at <a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/vze2jt4p/">http://mysite.verizon.net/vze2jt4p/</a> 
        - can you put<br/>it into the webpage the next time you update and, since 
        it does not appear<br/>in What's New, should I republish it in the Group 
        as if it was new?  We will<br/>publish a second one this spring and 
        will place it in the web page as well<br/>as that seems to work 
        best.<br/><br/>Lastly, do you have a background called "scroll.gif" that I 
        can have to use<br/>a the background for the clues on the

        fun, easy bike ride.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>You won’t have to work on Maggie’s Farm no 
        more…</p>
<p>If you follow Maggie’s Family . . . . 
        .<span>  </span>to the shore.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Our first box we’ve stashed in a beautiful 
        place,</p>
<p>Where people are scarce, yes, hardly a 
        trace.</p>
<p>It’s not easy to get to, in fact quite a 
        hike,</p>
<p>So may we suggest that you dust off your 
        bike.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Load up the car and head “Back” to the 
        “Bay,”</p>
<p>You’ll pass through the “bridge” of “Sand” 
        on your way.</p>
<p>Follow Sandpiper south to the Refuge 
        gate,</p>
<p>When you get to the Station, there’s no 
        need to wait.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>You’ll see lots of birds, and horses, and 
        maybe a wild boar,</p>
<p>So pay the five dollars and be glad it’s 
        not more.</p>
<p>Unload all the bikes and start down the 
        path.</p>
<p>You’ve got four miles to go, because we 
        did the math.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Take your water, your camera, your lunch, 
        and embark,</p>
<p>Go down the main path and head for the 
        park.</p>
<p>You’ll come to a fork, both trails 
        well-traveled.</p>
<p>But go left on East Dike; we hope you’re 
        not baffled.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And whatever you do, don’t take the Dune 
        Trail,</p>
<p>You’ll end up on the beach and you will 
        have failed.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>You’ll pass by a sign with a date and a 
        duck.</p>
<p>You may think it’s there, but oh, no such 
        luck!</p>
<p>We hid it there first, but we did all 
        agree,</p>
<p>It was too easy to find, and there’s much 
        more to see!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Peddle on to the park and don’t miss the 
        boat,</p>
<p>Veer to the left and be sure to take 
        note.</p>
<p>You’ll come to a platform, “22” it is 
        marked,</p>
<p>Stop for a rest, you’ll be glad that you 
        parked.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Soon you’ll be at the Station, in a moment 
        or so,</p>
<p>It’s quite clean and tidy in case you’ve 
        “Got to GO!”</p>
<p>You’ll see a small shop and tables (if 
        you’ve brought something to eat)</p>
<p>Inside’s a nice man who we think you 
        should meet.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Look all around at this blissful 
        location,</p>
<p>It’s a nice place to camp should you be on 
        vacation.</p>
<p>But since you’re on a real quest, turn 
        left at the sign,</p>
<p>That reads, “Ocean/Beach Camp.” You’re 
        close to the find!!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Past the ramp on the left (but what is it 
        for?)</p>
<p>NO! Don’t turn right to Washwoods - keep 
        on to the shore.</p>
<p>The trail’s a bit sandy. It’s a little 
        hard going,</p>
<p>We saw horses there -- their manes all 
        aglowing.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>When you get to the walkway (it’s wooden) 
        just park,</p>
<p>Time to walk a ways now… so get on your 
        mark.</p>
<p>Step on to the planks and count out your 
        paces,</p>
<p>Fifty, sixty, or more if you wear little 
        shoelaces.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Pass “Delicate Dunes” and glance right for 
        our riddle,</p>
<p>You’ll see some bushes with a dead branch 
        in the middle.</p>
<p>Reach down in the sea grass, but look 
        ‘fore you grab,</p>
<p>You’ll discover our prize, and we hope not 
        a crab!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Now once you’ve “stamped in” you can do 
        what you likes,</p>
<p>But may we suggest that you get back on 
        your bikes.</p>
<p>Head over the dunes, and we hope it’s low 
        tide.</p>
<p>Because if it is you are in for a 
        ride!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And even if the tide is a little bit 
        high,</p>
<p>Just follow the beach with the ocean right 
        by.</p>
<p>It’s a beautiful site, unspoiled, like a 
        myth,</p>
<p>Must have looked much the same to Capt. 
        John Smith.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Head back whence you came and try not to 
        roam,</p>
<p>NOW take the Dune Trail and find your way 
        home.</p>
<p>So ends your adventure. The day is now 
        done.</p>
<p>Good luck on your next quest. We hope 
        you’ve had fun.</p></div><br/><br/><tt>To unsubscribe:

And there are many Richmond-area boxers who would surely attend a<br/>

Williamsburg last week. It was huge, with lots of trails, nice<br/>

<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>You wont have to work on Maggies Farm no more</p>
<p>If you follow Maggies Family . . . . .<span>  </span>to the shore.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Our first box weve stashed in a beautiful place,</p>
<p>Where people are scarce, yes, hardly a trace.</p>
<p>Its not easy to get to, in fact quite a hike,</p>
<p>So may we suggest that you dust off your bike.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Load up the car and head Back to the Bay,</p>
<p>Youll pass through the bridge of Sand on your way.</p>
<p>Follow Sandpiper south to the Refuge gate,</p>
<p>When you get to the Station, theres no need to wait.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Youll see lots of birds, and horses, and maybe a wild boar,</p>
<p>So pay the five dollars and be glad its not more.</p>
<p>Unload all the bikes and start down the path.</p>
<p>Youve got four miles to go, because we did the math.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Take your water, your camera, your lunch, and embark,</p>
<p>Go down the main path and head for the park.</p>
<p>Youll come to a fork, both trails well-traveled.</p>
<p>But go left on East Dike; we hope youre not baffled.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And whatever you do, dont take the Dune Trail,</p>
<p>Youll end up on the beach and you will have failed.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Youll pass by a sign with a date and a duck.</p>
<p>You may think its there, but oh, no such luck!</p>
<p>We hid it there first, but we did all agree,</p>
<p>It was too easy to find, and theres much more to see!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Peddle on to the park and dont miss the boat,</p>
<p>Veer to the left and be sure to take note.</p>
<p>Youll come to a platform, 22 it is marked,</p>
<p>Stop for a rest, youll be glad that you parked.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Soon youll be at the Station, in a moment or so,</p>
<p>Its quite clean and tidy in case youve Got to GO!</p>
<p>Youll see a small shop and tables (if youve brought something to eat)</p>
<p>Insides a nice man who we think you should meet.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Look all around at this blissful location,</p>
<p>Its a nice place to camp should you be on vacation.</p>
<p>But since youre on a real quest, turn left at the sign,</p>
<p>That reads, Ocean/Beach Camp. Youre close to the find!!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Past the ramp on the left (but what is it for?)</p>
<p>NO! Dont turn right to Washwoods - keep on to the shore.</p>
<p>The trails a bit sandy. Its a little hard going,</p>
<p>We saw horses there -- their manes all aglowing.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>When you get to the walkway (its wooden) just park,</p>
<p>Time to walk a ways now so get on your mark.</p>
<p>Step on to the planks and count out your paces,</p>
<p>Fifty, sixty, or more if you wear little shoelaces.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Pass Delicate Dunes and glance right for our riddle,</p>
<p>Youll see some bushes with a dead branch in the middle.</p>
<p>Reach down in the sea grass, but look fore you grab,</p>
<p>Youll discover our prize, and we hope not a crab!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Now once youve stamped in you can do what you likes,</p>
<p>But may we suggest that you get back on your bikes.</p>
<p>Head over the dunes, and we hope its low tide.</p>
<p>Because if it is you are in for a ride!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And even if the tide is a little bit high,</p>
<p>Just follow the beach with the ocean right by.</p>
<p>Its a beautiful site, unspoiled, like a myth,</p>
<p>Must have looked much the same to Capt. John Smith.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>

<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;I'd like that, but I only know 4 letterboxers in Tidewater, VA. I'd be 
<div></div>&gt;happy to sponsor a kayak trip to find my NC box. Do you think folks 
<div></div>&gt;would like to rent boats for that? Maybe I'll have planted kayakers 
<div></div>&gt;boxes in VB and Norfolk by the time we could arrange a gathering. I must 
<div></div>&gt;be very honest though and say that I cannot be an organizer of the 
<div></div>&gt;entire event. I can show up with a trailerload of boats somewhere, but I 
<div></div>&gt;am unable to be the major contact for the gathering. Your thoughts? How 
<div></div>&gt;many locals are there?

<div></div>&gt;I also checked out your website and thought it was great too. I live in 
<div></div>&gt;Norfolk. Maybe all the locals should start thinking about a gathering 
<div></div>&gt;here in Tidewater. I think that there's a bunch of us here. What do you 
<div></div>&gt;think?

<div></div>&gt;Hello Trish, 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;My family is new to Letterboxing and planted our first box in Virginia 
<div></div>&gt;Beach 
<div></div>&gt;last September. It then took us until early December to get the Poem 
<div></div>&gt;written and up on the site. But I am afraid it has gotten lost. It 
<div></div>&gt;actually showed up on the What's New page for awhile but has now 
<div></div>&gt;disappeared 
<div></div>&gt;(or at least I cannot find it). Then, when I saw your e-mail that the 
<div></div>&gt;VA 
<div></div>&gt;webpage had been updated, I didn't see it. So I am afraid the clue 
<div></div>&gt;itself 
<div></div>&gt;has disappeared - hope the box is still there. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;I am attaching the original e-mail with the clues. Since then, I have 
<div></div>&gt;placed it in a webpage at http://mysite.verizon.net/vze2jt4p/ - can you 
<div></div>&gt;put 
<div></div>&gt;it into the webpage the next time you update and, since it does not 
<div></div>&gt;appear 
<div></div>&gt;in What's New, should I republish it in the Group as if it was new? We 
<div></div>&gt;will 
<div></div>&gt;publish a second one this spring and will place it in the web page as 
<div></div>&gt;well 
<div></div>&gt;as that seems to work best. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Lastly, do you have a background called "scroll.gif" that I can have to 
<div></div>&gt;use 
<div></div>&gt;a the background for the clues on the page? 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Many questions - thanks for your help.

<div></div>&gt; &gt; The VA webpages have been updated. I have created "master" webpages

<p>You wont have to work on Maggies Farm no 
        more</p>
<p>If you follow Maggies Family . . . . 
        .<span>  </span>to the shore.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Our first box weve stashed in a beautiful 
        place,</p>
<p>Where people are scarce, yes, hardly a 
        trace.</p>
<p>Its not easy to get to, in fact quite a 
        hike,</p>
<p>So may we suggest that you dust off your 
        bike.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Load up the car and head Back to the 
        Bay,</p>
<p>Youll pass through the bridge of Sand 
        on your way.</p>
<p>Follow Sandpiper south to the Refuge 
        gate,</p>
<p>When you get to the Station, theres no 
        need to wait.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Youll see lots of birds, and horses, and 
        maybe a wild boar,</p>
<p>So pay the five dollars and be glad its 
        not more.</p>
<p>Unload all the bikes and start down the 
        path.</p>
<p>Youve got four miles to go, because we 
        did the math.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Take your water, your camera, your lunch, 
        and embark,</p>
<p>Go down the main path and head for the 
        park.</p>
<p>Youll come to a fork, both trails 
        well-traveled.</p>
<p>But go left on East Dike; we hope youre 
        not baffled.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And whatever you do, dont take the Dune 
        Trail,</p>
<p>Youll end up on the beach and you will 
        have failed.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Youll pass by a sign with a date and a 
        duck.</p>
<p>You may think its there, but oh, no such 
        luck!</p>
<p>We hid it there first, but we did all 
        agree,</p>
<p>It was too easy to find, and theres much 
        more to see!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Peddle on to the park and dont miss the 
        boat,</p>
<p>Veer to the left and be sure to take 
        note.</p>
<p>Youll come to a platform, 22 it is 
        marked,</p>
<p>Stop for a rest, youll be glad that you 
        parked.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Soon youll be at the Station, in a moment 
        or so,</p>
<p>Its quite clean and tidy in case youve 
        Got to GO!</p>
<p>Youll see a small shop and tables (if 
        youve brought something to eat)</p>
<p>Insides a nice man who we think you 
        should meet.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Look all around at this blissful 
        location,</p>
<p>Its a nice place to camp should you be on 
        vacation.</p>
<p>But since youre on a real quest, turn 
        left at the sign,</p>
<p>That reads, Ocean/Beach Camp. Youre 
        close to the find!!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Past the ramp on the left (but what is it 
        for?)</p>
<p>NO! Dont turn right to Washwoods - keep 
        on to the shore.</p>
<p>The trails a bit sandy. Its a little 
        hard going,</p>
<p>We saw horses there -- their manes all 
        aglowing.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>When you get to the walkway (its wooden) 
        just park,</p>
<p>Time to walk a ways now so get on your 
        mark.</p>
<p>Step on to the planks and count out your 
        paces,</p>
<p>Fifty, sixty, or more if you wear little 
        shoelaces.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Pass Delicate Dunes and glance right for 
        our riddle,</p>
<p>Youll see some bushes with a dead branch 
        in the middle.</p>
<p>Reach down in the sea grass, but look 
        fore you grab,</p>
<p>Youll discover our prize, and we hope not 
        a crab!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Now once youve stamped in you can do 
        what you likes,</p>
<p>But may we suggest that you get back on 
        your bikes.</p>
<p>Head over the dunes, and we hope its low 
        tide.</p>
<p>Because if it is you are in for a 
        ride!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And even if the tide is a little bit 
        high,</p>
<p>Just follow the beach with the ocean right 
        by.</p>
<p>Its a beautiful site, unspoiled, like a 
        myth,</p>
<p>Must have looked much the same to Capt. 
        John Smith.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Head back whence you came and try not to 
        roam,</p>
<p>NOW take the Dune Trail and find your way 
        home.</p>
<p>So ends your adventure. The day is now 
        done.</p>
<p>Good luck on your next quest. We hope 
        youve had fun.</p></div><br/><br/><tt>To unsubscribe:

We have the same situation with little ones and kayaking...but maybe we could just do a Hampton Roads "gathering" of all ages and then those interested in kayaking could sign up at that time.  I'm thinking that's killing two birds with one stone...a gathering for everyone and it takes some of the coordination effort off of Lillie's shoulders.  Of course I haven't had my mornin' cup of joe yet so this may very well make no sense.  <br/>

				actually showed up on the What's New<br/>
page for awhile but has now disappeared<br/>
				(or at least I cannot find it).  Then,<br/>
when I saw your e-mail that the VA<br/>
				webpage had been updated, I didn't see<br/>
it.  So I am afraid the clue itself<br/>
				has disappeared - hope the box is still<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
				I am attaching the original e-mail with<br/>
the clues.  Since then, I have<br/>
				placed it in a webpage at<br/>
http://mysite.verizon.net/vze2jt4p/ - can you put<br/>
				it into the webpage the next time you<br/>
update and, since it does not appear<br/>
				in What's New, should I republish it in<br/>
the Group as if it was new?  We will<br/>
				publish a second one this spring and<br/>
will place it in the web page as well<br/>
				as that seems to work best.<br/>
<br/>
				Lastly, do you have a background called<br/>
"scroll.gif" that I can have to use<br/>
				a the background for the clues on the<br/>
page?<br/>
<br/>
				Many questions - thanks for your help.<br/>

<br/>
				&gt; The VA webpages have been updated.  I<br/>
have created "master" webpages<br/>

VA.  If you would like a single<br/>

offline with the names of the<br/>

				Webmaster:<br/>
<br/>
				This is our first box posting and I hope<br/>
we've done it right.  We probably will add more boxes so you could call<br/>
the page Maggie's Family's Boxes or something like that.  Here we go.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<mailto:maggies.family@verizon.net> <br/>
				Date Placed: 09/16/02<br/>
<br/>
				Time:  3-4 hours by bike, round trip,<br/>
with stops<br/>
				Location: Virginia Beach, VA<br/>
				Difficulty: Serious walk; fun, easy bike<br/>
ride.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				You wont have to work on Maggies Farm<br/>
no more<br/>
<br/>
				If you follow Maggies Family . . . . .<br/>
to the shore.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				Our first box weve stashed in a<br/>
beautiful place,<br/>
<br/>
				Where people are scarce, yes, hardly a<br/>
trace.<br/>
<br/>
				Its not easy to get to, in fact quite a<br/>
hike,<br/>
<br/>
				So may we suggest that you dust off your<br/>
bike.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				Load up the car and head Back to the<br/>
Bay,<br/>
<br/>
				Youll pass through the bridge of<br/>
Sand on your way.<br/>
<br/>
				Follow Sandpiper south to the Refuge<br/>
gate,<br/>
<br/>
				When you get to the Station, theres no<br/>
need to wait.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				Youll see lots of birds, and horses,<br/>
and maybe a wild boar,<br/>
<br/>
				So pay the five dollars and be glad its<br/>
not more.<br/>
<br/>
				Unload all the bikes and start down the<br/>
path.<br/>
<br/>
				Youve got four miles to go, because we<br/>
did the math.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				Take your water, your camera, your<br/>
lunch, and embark,<br/>
<br/>
				Go down the main path and head for the<br/>
park.<br/>
<br/>
				Youll come to a fork, both trails<br/>
well-traveled.<br/>
<br/>
				But go left on East Dike; we hope youre<br/>
not baffled.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				And whatever you do, dont take the Dune<br/>
Trail,<br/>
<br/>
				Youll end up on the beach and you will<br/>
have failed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				Youll pass by a sign with a date and a<br/>
duck.<br/>
<br/>
				You may think its there, but oh, no<br/>
such luck!<br/>
<br/>
				We hid it there first, but we did all<br/>
agree,<br/>
<br/>
				It was too easy to find, and theres<br/>
much more to see!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				Peddle on to the park and dont miss the<br/>
boat,<br/>
<br/>
				Veer to the left and be sure to take<br/>
note.<br/>
<br/>
				Youll come to a platform, 22 it is<br/>
marked,<br/>
<br/>
				Stop for a rest, youll be glad that you<br/>
parked.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				Soon youll be at the Station, in a<br/>
moment or so,<br/>
<br/>
				Its quite clean and tidy in case youve<br/>
Got to GO!<br/>
<br/>
				Youll see a small shop and tables (if<br/>
youve brought something to eat)<br/>
<br/>
				Insides a nice man who we think you<br/>
should meet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				Look all around at this blissful<br/>
location,<br/>
<br/>
				Its a nice place to camp should you be<br/>
on vacation.<br/>
<br/>
				But since youre on a real quest, turn<br/>
left at the sign,<br/>
<br/>
				That reads, Ocean/Beach Camp. Youre<br/>
close to the find!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				Past the ramp on the left (but what is<br/>
it for?)<br/>
<br/>
				NO! Dont turn right to Washwoods - keep<br/>
on to the shore.<br/>
<br/>
				The trails a bit sandy. Its a little<br/>
hard going,<br/>
<br/>
				We saw horses there -- their manes all<br/>
aglowing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				When you get to the walkway (its<br/>
wooden) just park,<br/>
<br/>
				Time to walk a ways now so get on your<br/>
mark.<br/>
<br/>
				Step on to the planks and count out your<br/>
paces,<br/>
<br/>
				Fifty, sixty, or more if you wear little<br/>
shoelaces.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				Pass Delicate Dunes and glance right<br/>
for our riddle,<br/>
<br/>
				Youll see some bushes with a dead<br/>
branch in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
				Reach down in the sea grass, but look<br/>
fore you grab,<br/>
<br/>
				Youll discover our prize, and we hope<br/>
not a crab!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				Now once youve stamped in you can do<br/>
what you likes,<br/>
<br/>
				But may we suggest that you get back on<br/>
your bikes.<br/>
<br/>
				Head over the dunes, and we hope its<br/>
low tide.<br/>
<br/>
				Because if it is you are in for a ride!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				And even if the tide is a little bit<br/>
high,<br/>
<br/>
				Just follow the beach with the ocean<br/>
right by.<br/>
<br/>
				Its a beautiful site, unspoiled, like a<br/>
myth,<br/>
<br/>
				Must have looked much the same to Capt.<br/>
John Smith.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				Head back whence you came and try not to<br/>
roam,<br/>
<br/>
				NOW take the Dune Trail and find your<br/>
way home.<br/>
<br/>
				So ends your adventure. The day is now<br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
				Good luck on your next quest. We hope<br/>
youve had fun.<br/>
