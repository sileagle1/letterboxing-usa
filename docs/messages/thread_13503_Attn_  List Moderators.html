transferred from Egroups, and many of my members don't even have Yahoo ID's<br/>

This info is from the Help desk at Yahoo Groups.  I can explain how to set<br/>
it up if you're interested.  You can email me off list at<br/>

&gt; I moderate an email list at Yahoo.  I added unsubscription info which<br/>
&gt; appears at the bottom of each message that is sent out on the list.  There<br/>
&gt; are still people who send a message to the list asking someone to<br/>

<br/>
There used to be such a footer.  It didn't reduce the number of these <br/>
messages.  I removed it as it was bothersome to some regulars, while not<br/>
achieving its purpose at the cost of this bother.<br/>
<br/>
There were messages that literally looked like this:<br/>
<br/>
unsubscribe<br/>
<br/>
to unsubscribe [...]<br/>
