grandson along. Have them all excited about LBing. <br/>
We went first to the Thompson Creek Trail #1. Sorry to say this <br/>
letterbox was very, very, sick. In fact the box was terminal and so <br/>
was the beautiful log book inside. Everything was totally soaked. I <br/>
brought the box home to let it recuperate overnite. The stamp is <br/>
absolutely a work of art. This box has been listed as abondoned and I <br/>
will ask the webmasters if I may adopt it. I will be replacing it <br/>
with a new box and logbook tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
WE also went to the Rancho Santa Ana Botanical garden. WEll, this is <br/>
really nice if you can read clues. DUH!! WE started off by passing <br/>
the first turn off and wound up somewhere in the middle of the clues. <br/>
It took us about an hour but we did find it. It is in great shape. <br/>
and loved the box for this one. Along the way we say a jackrabbit, <br/>
lots of squirrels, some turtles and plenty of lizzards. We had Great <br/>
day. Purple Iris<br/>

Well, I'm afraid I'm a little embarassed. When I first saw the clues<br/>
for the Thompson Creek Box It was abandoned. But Upon returning home<br/>
I find that it has an owner. So, I have e-mailed the owner and hope<br/>
they will excuse my ignorance. But the box is absolutely busted up,<br/>
so I will replace the logbook after having dried it out and<br/>
everything else that was in the box, putting it in a new box. I hope<br/>
I haven't broken too many rules. Purple Iris<br/>
