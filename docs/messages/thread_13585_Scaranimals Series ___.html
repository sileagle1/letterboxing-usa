Did you find the one under the trellis?  If so, you're doing great!  Just <br/>
wanted to let you all know that we did locate the Mangorilla a little <br/>
farther back from the playground than anticipated.  We refused to give up!  <br/>
As Gaabriel mentioned, there was a lot of construction around the spot.  <br/>
It's a cute series, isn't it?  We loved that the poems were included at the <br/>
start of each log book!  BeMa<br/>

Hi Gaabriel!  I saw from an earlier post that you were making more stamps to <br/>
add to this series.  We've been gone for a week and I had to unsubscribe to <br/>
the announce list 'cause it was generating so many emails (I signed back up <br/>
again now that I am back!)  I looked in the what's new and saw the really <br/>
cool box at the Grange and the Frankenstein ones in Falls Church.  Did I <br/>
miss any other local ones?  Did you post some other Scranimals boxes?<br/>
<br/>
So, there putting in a putt-putt course at Burke Lake Park.  That should be <br/>
neat!  We thought they were just expanding the parking lot (mini-golf is <br/>
much better than more parking in our book!)<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all are doing well!  Nancy (BeMa)<br/>

Hey, Nancy - mini or disc golf is what I heard but I havne't been able to get <br/>
out there.  My car is in the shop and I'm hoping to go as soon as it's out.  <br/>
I have one box done to add to the series and another that I'm doing.<br/>
I don't know that there were others but check the site cause I'm short on <br/>
short-term memory ("ow!  thinking hard....)  I hope you're all well and that you <br/>
were out of town on a great vacation or something cool like that.<br/>
