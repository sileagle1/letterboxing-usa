                    <div class="plaintext-content">Would you please post these clues on the Letterboxing North America <br/>
website? Thanks! TITLE: "EERIE, EERIE, ERIE." DIFFICULTY; EASY. <br/>
LOCATION: CHILLICOTHE, OHIO. (ROSS COUNTY). The general area where <br/>
this letterbox is hidden was once part of the route of the Ohio-Erie <br/>
Canal. In the 1930's-40's, my father and his friends used to shortcut <br/>
through the area on the way home from the movie theater. Invariably, <br/>
one or two of the boys would slip off from the rest of the group, <br/>
circle around ahead and jump out from behind a tree, scaring the heck <br/>
out of the others. While today I can find nothing at all menacing in <br/>
this place, I can imagine how it may have seemed to several <br/>
youngsters walking through it in the dark many years ago, after <br/>
viewing a horror movie double feature.  CLUES: Parking is available <br/>
on Water Street, between Walnut and Paint Streets. Take the steps <br/>
which go from the north side of Water Street down to the lake in the <br/>
city park. Proceed down the sidewalk to your left, until you come to <br/>
a very large Sycamore tree. Standing on the sidewalk in front of the <br/>
tree, take a reading of 295 degrees. Walk in that direction until you <br/>
reach a tall pine tree with a semi-circular wall around it. The <br/>
letterbox in hidden somewhere in the wall.HINT: Look for a place <br/>
which looks different from the rest.<br/>
