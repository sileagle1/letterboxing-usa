                    <div class="plaintext-content">I posted this at the HH group and see that this group has a lot more<br/>
visitors/posts, so I am posting question again here.  I had asked<br/>
whether a very strong industrial-strength plastic zip-lock container<br/>
that when folded once holds my stamp and log book to the tune of 4 1/4<br/>
x 3 1/2, about a half inch thick (container is designed for keeping<br/>
credit cards, money, etc. dry - I use it while snorkeling) as opposed<br/>
to a rigid container as small as I can find would be best method of<br/>
travel for my first such experiment.  I'm anxious to "launch" the HH<br/>
and want it to move well.  In the few boxes I've encountered, some<br/>
have been too small and tightly packed to accept anything the size of<br/>
mine, others have had no room in the hidey hole for another box - any<br/>
opinions from experienced LBers?  I got the following response at the<br/>
other smaller group specifically geared towards HH issues and wonder<br/>
if any of you agree or disagree:<br/>
"In general it is easier to find places to leave HH if they are just<br/>
in the baggie and not in their own rigid container. --SpringChick" <br/>
I don't have enough experience to argue with that response, and a kind<br/>
soul might be more likely to replace the baggie if it were worn than a<br/>
damaged box, but I wonder how many boxes actually have enough room for<br/>
a traveler like mine.  Do you ever run across travelers that have been<br/>
just stuck next to a box without benefit of a box, just in the baggie?<br/>
 I don't think I would want that.  Maybe I'm obsessing too much about<br/>
the whole thing, as is my habit.  The only HH I have come across was<br/>
in a box.  Anyway, I'll welcome opinions. <br/>

created a HH that was carved to fit into the lid of  film canister. I glued<br/>
it in so it would remain there and used the rest of the canister to hold the<br/>
log book. I happen to find my own HH about 6 months later and someone had<br/>
pried the stamp out and put it and the log book into a baggie. I was NOT<br/>
happy.<br/>

  it is your hitchhiker pack it how you want. there is benefits to a baggie<br/>
