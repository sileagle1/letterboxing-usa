and Phyto for stirring the pot. I agree that those who are new to the hobby owe it to <br/>
themselves and the rest of us to do a lttle homework before they jump into the brew. <br/>
There's tons of great info on the LbNA alone not to mention all the other wonderful <br/>
sites to be found. Perhaps there should be a note at the top of the Talk List directing <br/>
newbies to the FAQs???<br/>
<br/>
As for scout troops on the hunt, I have followed in the footsteps of such groups <br/>
several times. On more than one occasion I have found the boxes rehidden with a <br/>
telltale pile of neatly placed, freshly broken, sticks concealing them. Granted, they are <br/>
out of sight but hidden in such an obviously manmade manner that they draw <br/>
immediate attention. In addition, each scout has taken a whole page with their stamp <br/>
even if three quarters of the previous one is empty. Many logbooks do not have <br/>
enough pages to handle this many entries. Once again, it's up to the leaders to teach <br/>
their charges courtesy and no trace ethics.<br/>
<br/>
Then there's Mr. Snicket's oevres... this is the best thing to hit the List in ages. I do <br/>
hope that they get the attention these amazing boxes and clues deserve. Funhog<br/>
