Mama Bear and Cubs have planted our first letterboxes<br/>
on 08/05/01. They are located in Storrs CT, (Tolland<br/>
County). Here are the clues:<br/>
<br/>
Bird Walk Letterboxes (2)<br/>
<br/>
Rated: Easy, 1.5 to 2 hour hike on flat terrain,<br/>
suggest long pants (ticks, poison ivy)<br/>
<br/>
Take Gurleyville Rd. from Rte 195 at UConn.<br/>
<br/>
At 1 mile youll pass where fireflies light.<br/>
Look for a double blue blaze on a pole at the right.<br/>
On the left youll find the trailhead and a place to<br/>
park<br/>
For the Bird Walk Letterboxes are quite a lark!<br/>
<br/>
The mighty Fenton River runs clean and true<br/>
The blazes youll follow are painted in blue<br/>
Quiet now, for if you hush<br/>
You may hear a Water thrush.<br/>
<br/>
The trial turns left, the river does, too.<br/>
Still all youll do is follow the blue.<br/>
Youll come upon a wooden bridge to cross.<br/>
Then on your left a half-fallen oak, clad in moss<br/>
<br/>
And in its base, hidden from view<br/>
THE GREAT BLUE HERON waits for you.<br/>
But youre not finished, theres more hiking to do.<br/>
Pick up your backpack and follow the blue.<br/>
<br/>
Blue goes on, another bridge is crossed.<br/>
Then a pumphouse on the left (youre not lost).<br/>
But Blue jogs left onto a street<br/>
Then dives back again after 100 feet.<br/>
<br/>
Through thick Mountain Laurel youll go<br/>
Enjoying the view of the river below.<br/>
Chickadees sing and Chickadees play,<br/>
If you follow the blue trail youll be OK.<br/>
<br/>
After a while on the right youll see<br/>
A little house called UC-B.<br/>
Then cross a street, you will know<br/>
The blue blazes show you where to go.<br/>
<br/>
Through some boulders and over a brook. <br/>
Step into a field and take a look.<br/>
Wild flowers and butterflies abound <br/>
And a dirt road invites you down.<br/>
<br/>
Follow this road till it comes to a fork <br/>
Pull out your compass and look due north.<br/>
A tree with an arrow you have found.<br/>
Walk to this tree and look around.<br/>
<br/>
For here is a favorite spot for Mama Bear <br/>
To rest by the river and enjoy cool air.<br/>
While she sits on a rock or a fallen log, <br/>
Bear cubs splash and look for frogs.<br/>
<br/>
But for our next treasure, put the tree to your back<br/>
And pull your trusty compass right out of your pack.<br/>
At 260 degrees, a campsite is spotted<br/>
Nestled next to a small ledge, with moss it is dotted.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the ledge, Up, Over and Under<br/>
And soon youll find a treasure to plunder<br/>
A BARN SWALLOW is waiting for you.<br/>
Stamp in in secret, now you are through.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
