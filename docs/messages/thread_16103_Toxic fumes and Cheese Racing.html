eat these racers after meltdown? and how do you declare a winner? Is <br/>
it the person getting hit by Martha Stewart? Is the cheese all <br/>
purchased at the same place or do can some nameless individuals <br/>
cheat and use cheese that has been stored at the local atomic power <br/>
plants?<br/>
