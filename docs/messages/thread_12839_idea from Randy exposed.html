Maybe I'm part of the minority, too, but I wholeheartedly agree that<br/>
the mystique is the essential thing. Lets hear it for the golden<br/>
triangle of treasure hunting! For me, the stamp and logbook in my hand<br/>
is a surprise and reward for the journey. It isn't as much fun when<br/>
I've seen them online even before I've even left the house.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise I prefer the minimalist clues that make you do a little<br/>
homework to find the box instead of spelling out every freeway exit<br/>
and cross street just to get to the parking lot where the trail<br/>
starts. Its all part of the thrill of the hunt, to pull out the<br/>
roadmap and find the way to that park or that trailhead, not really<br/>
knowing what to expect there. I think its possible to make an elegant<br/>
and straightforward clue without cluttering it up with unnecessary<br/>
information. Whether its an easy or hard clue, it can still be written<br/>
simply and clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thats just what I find enjoyable about these kinds of treasure<br/>
hunts. What does everyone else think?<br/>

<br/>
This is resonating with me, too. Some of the better<br/>
boxes we've searched for were ones with vague clues,<br/>
or were in parks that weren't well known or had<br/>
incomplete directions. One of the first boxes we did<br/>
is on a reservation in western Mass with so many<br/>
interconnecting trails that you can come up on the box<br/>
from no less than four different routes. Another great<br/>
example of this is the Tree For All Seasons in eastern<br/>
Mass. You've got to find a tree with a specific number<br/>
on it, but that's the only clue you get.<br/>
<br/>
Thus far, though, all of our boxes, with one<br/>
exception, have been fairly direct, with simple walks<br/>
and directions. Although we're only a half hour from<br/>
the letterboxer heaven that is Mansfield CT, there are<br/>
very few boxes, comparatively, in our part of<br/>
Massachusetts. So we decided to make our boxes simple,<br/>
to encourage folks to get involved.<br/>
<br/>
But that is going to change verra soon. We're planning<br/>
our first mystery box.... :-)<br/>

L'ger's boxes were the first I found, so were my introduction to this whole thing.  I love figuring out the riddles for myself.  Even when I have had to go back 2 or 3 times to find it, I've loved puzzling things out.  And I do tend to feel that any comments about the status of a box really should come from the person who created it.  If I have a question or comment about a box, I email the creator personally - if that information is available.  Just my thoughts<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Matt the Rat<br/>
<br/>
I would have to agree...  I much prefer clues that require me to do <br/>
some research ahead of time and/or to consult the map or other <br/>
sources to find where I am going.  Even when on the trail, I like <br/>
riddles and puzzles and non-direct clues...  would love the one where <br/>
you have to look for a tree with a certain number on.<br/>
<br/>
I think you have to expect that landmarks are going to change, trees <br/>
fall and trails get rerouted, etc.  You have to take the clues as an <br/>
overall.  I think with the direct clues -- turn here, look for this, <br/>
etc. you tend to take one little step at a time and get thrown off <br/>
when something doesn't fit or the terrain has changed since the <br/>
person wrote the clues.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that irks me is obscurity once I am at the spot where <br/>
the box should be.  Once I have reached the end of the clues and am <br/>
at the place, I want it to be rather obvious where the box is so I <br/>
don't have to go hunting around, disturbing the surroundings, under <br/>
every fallen log and pile of sticks.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I have written a variety of clues, many very direct <br/>
and easy, primarily because there were no boxes here and the easier <br/>
ones seemed a better way to get things off the ground.  But I am <br/>
certainly having a lot more fun doing the ones of late where the <br/>
clues are much less straightforward.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; [...]<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the mapping becomes more imperfect.  This represents two sides <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; what <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I call the golden triangle of treasure hunting.  The thrill of<br/>
&gt; &gt; discovery <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; occurs when these imperfections are experienced.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  [...]<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; To make a long story short, it removes the mystique.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe I'm part of the minority, too, but I wholeheartedly agree <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; the mystique is the essential thing. Lets hear it for the golden<br/>
&gt; &gt; triangle of treasure hunting! For me, the stamp and logbook in my <br/>
&gt; hand<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a surprise and reward for the journey. It isn't as much fun <br/>
when<br/>
&gt; &gt; I've seen them online even before I've even left the house.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Likewise I prefer the minimalist clues that make you do a little<br/>
&gt; &gt; homework to find the box instead of spelling out every freeway <br/>
exit<br/>
&gt; &gt; and cross street just to get to the parking lot where the trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; starts. Its all part of the thrill of the hunt, to pull out the<br/>
&gt; &gt; roadmap and find the way to that park or that trailhead, not <br/>
really<br/>
&gt; &gt; knowing what to expect there. I think its possible to make an <br/>
&gt; elegant<br/>
&gt; &gt; and straightforward clue without cluttering it up with unnecessary<br/>
&gt; &gt; information. Whether its an easy or hard clue, it can still be <br/>
&gt; written<br/>
&gt; &gt; simply and clearly.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, thats just what I find enjoyable about these kinds of <br/>
&gt; treasure<br/>
&gt; &gt; hunts. What does everyone else think?<br/>

&gt;I like em' easy. I go for the hike (physical workout) not the mental <br/>

I would definitely have to agree!  I like the thrill of finding all boxes, <br/>
however, there seems, as my choir director says, that "it is a very <br/>
satisfying thing" when I find an especially difficult box.  Mystery boxes <br/>
especially have this thrill for me, especially ones like Dancing Men in RI, <br/>
Going Downhill in RI, Some of Jay Drew's mystery boxes...(if I could spell <br/>
them correctly, I would name them, however the website for CT is down and I <br/>
can't get the correct spellings), legerdemaine boxes etc....  When I found <br/>
Dancing Men, I felt like I won the lottery!<br/>
