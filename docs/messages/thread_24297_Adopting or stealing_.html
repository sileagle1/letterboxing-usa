A letterbox is an ephermal, fleeting piece of art created with the <br/>
intent to impart a certain experience.  That experience changes every <br/>
time someone comes to visit.  Part of that experience is that you <br/>
never quite know what you will find. (or if you will find it) <br/>
Sometimes you will see some new flora &amp; fauna or some fascinating <br/>
wildlife along the way.  Different seasons make the same box new.  <br/>
New signatures, comments or a HH get a new reaction.  Sometime a <br/>
letterbox has been ill-treated and will need a little TLC.  That can <br/>
be part of the experience too.  A letterbox is created with intention <br/>
from the artist and we can never fully know what was intended.  We <br/>
can only surmise.  Perhaps the intention was that it will only last a <br/>
little while.  So if you adopt a letterbox and you change any part of <br/>
it, then the creators intentions are lost to your intentions.  <br/>
<br/>
If a box has touched you so deeply that you feel it must be <br/>
perpetuated, I would much rather that someone place a new box of <br/>
their own creation, with a new logbook and new clues.  If it is in <br/>
the same area, so be it. Some places are meant to be seen.  But to <br/>
take any part of someone else's letterbox and call it yours is <br/>
stealing.  To change it in any way without permission, by moving it, <br/>
reworking the clues, or changing the stamp or logbook is an <br/>
infringement of the creator's ideas.  That is why we have copyright <br/>
laws.<br/>

in the<br/>

intact.  But<br/>
&gt; after going back to the location we determined that the spot was <br/>

I don't disagree about an owner's ownership of the box.  However, I'd <br/>

<br/>
In Texas recently, we had a case of a newbie who decided that she <br/>
didn't like the park where a couple of long-time letterboxes had been <br/>
placed (she believed it dangerous).  She persuaded the webmasters to <br/>
archive the boxes, claiming they were damaged, and then went a step <br/>
further and pulled the boxes.  I think most of us can aqree this is not <br/>
what we want.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, in my hometown, we have a boxer who planted 80 boxes <br/>
and then abandoned the hobby 18 months ago.  She doesn't respond to <br/>
emails, doesn't maintain her boxes and never updates the clues.  At <br/>
this point her boxes are just litterboxes, which I find more than a <br/>
little troubling too.<br/>
<br/>
On AQ, as her boxes go missing, I temporarily adopt them, change the <br/>
status, and then reassign them to her.  I don't feel comfortable <br/>
adopting them permanently, but I do want to try and keep the status as <br/>
current as possible. <br/>
<br/>
Where should we draw that line about old, seemingly abandoned boxes?  I <br/>
know this is an old topic, but this may be a good time to rehash at <br/>
least part of it.<br/>

<br/>
  I'm starting to warm up to the idea of archiving abandoned boxes, rather than adopting them out. <br/>
<br/>
  * archiving a box allows the owner to maintain all claims to their clues <br/>
  * archiving a box opens up the spot to other letterbox hiders. <br/>
  * should the owner return to the hobby they can easily re-activate the archived box(es)<br/>
<br/>
  Adopting a box<br/>
<br/>
  Perhaps adoption could be left to the owner of the box i.e. they transfer ownership to someone rather than the webmasters doing it. <br/>
<br/>
  Deleting an abandoned box<br/>
<br/>
  Some of the problems with deleting a box from the database:<br/>
<br/>
  * there no longer is a historical record of the box<br/>
  * people who like to keep a record of their finds lose that find from their online count (but, I've been told, LBNA logging feature was never meant to be an online record of finds, so this point is moot)<br/>
  * the box may be abandoned by the owner, but it may not be missing. Deleting or archiving the abandoned box could result in the box becoming litter. Hopefully the letterboxing community does not shrug off the potential litter issue. Consider how land managers would feel if we told them...if a hider loses interest in the game their letterbox will be removed from the database but the actual box may never be retrieved and could end up abandoned on the property. <br/>
  * if a box is deleted can the owner get the LBNA clue back i.e. would the webmasters be able to retrieve a deleted file?<br/>

A letterbox is created with intention from the artist and we can never fully<br/>
know what was intended. We<br/>
can only surmise. Perhaps the intention was that it will only last a little<br/>
while. So if you adopt a letterbox and you change any part of it, then the<br/>
creators intentions are lost to your intentions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
******Let me first say that because I haven't had the pleasure of finding<br/>
one of Kim's boxes and I don't know all sides of that particular situation,<br/>
I am not applying my comments to Kim's situation specifically.  I believe<br/>
the merits of that situation are best dealt with by the parties involved,<br/>
and not by all the onlookers who aren't privvy to all that has been said or<br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  I could buy into the whole intent thing, except that I don't by any<br/>
means believe that every letterbox is created with intention.  I can believe<br/>
that the good ones are.  It would be nice if they all were.  But they<br/>
aren't.  There are far too many boxes that are mediocre or worse stamps with<br/>
pocket spiral notebooks for logbooks, shoved into cheap containers, and all<br/>
but tossed out on the side of the road, with clues written from memory after<br/>
the fact.  What was THEIR intent?  There are even some nice decent boxes<br/>
that were done in earnest by reasonably talented letterboxers that were<br/>
caught up in the moment of their discovery of a new location or whatever,<br/>
who didn't develop a vision for that box - they just knew they wanted to<br/>
plant a box somewhere so that someone else could enjoy the same moment they<br/>
had.  What was THEIR intent?<br/>
<br/>
But even considering only the cream of the crop boxes, what is the intent of<br/>
someone who has thoughtfully created a box "with intent" and then left it to<br/>
exist on its own when they are no longer able to care for it for whatever<br/>
reason?  Hasn't their intent already been lost?  Or did they intend that the<br/>
box become trash?  Would they prefer it become trash as opposed to being<br/>
adopted by someone else who may be able to recreate some sort of vision for<br/>
the box?  I think that if someone has applied that much thought and<br/>
consideration to placing a box, they need to also see it through to the end<br/>
and if they reach a point of not being able to care for their box, they need<br/>
to bring it to a dignified end and pick it up if they don't want to see<br/>
someone else assume responsibility for it rather than let it become litter.<br/>
<br/>
This is NOT a commentary against the whole idea of "intent" (I like the idea<br/>
of intent).  I just have to wonder, if the artist has abandoned the box,<br/>
what does their intent matter really?<br/>
