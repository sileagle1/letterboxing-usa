<div>Hi All</div>
<div>        Well 
the new year is upon us once again. The weather is really bad as usual. We have 
had non stop gales for over a week now. Lots of Christmas stamps out over here. 
I normally get out on boxing day for a few but the weather was terrible. Went 
out this morning to get a series which on a hill overlooking my house but when I 
reached the top I could hardly stand up so I backed up and went home spent the 
day doing some filling, which always seems to get left. Entered all my found 
boxes on to my computer. Then stuck all the stamps in my binders. 
3.00pm   came and I had to get out. Found the clue to a box up the 
valley from me so off I went with the two dogs. Much to my delight I found it. 
One of the king and queen of Java's boxes. Walked back home down the lane in the 
dark. Tomorrow is a big day. It is the new years day meet. Hopping to get to Fur 
Tor weather permitting. For the last five years it has been bad normally 
snowing. Non forecasted for tomorrow but anything can happen and it usually 
does. Will let you all know.</div>
<div>Any way I would like to wish you all a happy and 
prosperous new year. Glad to see the compass bearings appearing in 
clues.</div>
<div>All the best to you all</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My daughter(16)and I have been letterboxing since Sept. 2002.  This <br/>
is a great bonding experience for us.  I just want to thank all my <br/>
fellow letterboxers for planting such an interesting and diverse <br/>
group of stamps.  We have been all over the State of CT. and in towns <br/>
I never heard of.  This hobby gives us a chance to work TOGETHER for <br/>
a common goal.  I cherish the time we are out and about looking for <br/>
treasures.  I hope everyone has a Happy, Healthy New Year full of <br/>
wonderful stamps. <br/>
Keep smiling, Reach for the Stars.<br/>
