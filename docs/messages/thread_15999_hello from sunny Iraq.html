                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to drop you all a note saying "hello from sunny Iraq".<br/>
<br/>
I know that I haven't posted to the list in quite some time now, as <br/>
things have been a little hectic here.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, now I do have the ability to get online somewhat regularly <br/>
and look forward to chatting with you all again in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to ask the group a question...if I am going "out of the <br/>
rules" here please let me know and I will stop.<br/>
<br/>
As one would expect there is not a bunch of involvement in the <br/>
letterboxing community here in Baghdad; at least not on the <br/>
local "Baghdadians" side of the fence. However, I have gotten quite a <br/>
few of the people in my unit here interested in the letterboxing <br/>
idea. My idea is to start off by creating a few boxes to hide on the <br/>
various bases and installations that we have here in Baghdad; then <br/>
see how far throughout other bases in Iraq I can help it spread. That <br/>
way, there is no harm and danger involved while hunting for the <br/>
boxes, while still being able to get more people involved in the <br/>
sport.<br/>
<br/>
Well given that this is a combat zone I did not think that I would <br/>
have an opportunity like this, thus I did not bring any of my boxing <br/>
gear with me.<br/>
<br/>
So here lies my question...<br/>
<br/>
Do any of you know of any local or chain stores that may be willing <br/>
to donate some letter boxing supplies to my unit over here in Iraq? <br/>
That way we can have some sort of stress free activity to do when we <br/>
do have a few minutes of down time. Maybe some erasers, exactos, <br/>
carvers, pencils, little notbooks for the logs, ziplock bags, <br/>
etc...Anything at all would help.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all upfront for your help and support. Any and all <br/>
information that you may be able to provide me with on possibly <br/>
getting some donations to start up an Iraqi Letterboxing group would <br/>
be greatly appreaciated.<br/>
<br/>

Good point. Yes, people are a little freaked out when they find "new packages and items" that they do not recognize on the various installations. However, I would be careful to place them in an environment that would minimize this panic. Probably place them in buildings, and let the person(s) in charge of those respective buildings know that they are there. That is of course once I explain to them the sport and get their permission to place the box(es) there.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a similar debate when I really wanted to leave a letterbox in<br/>
Jerusalem this summer.  It became a matter of some debate with some from the<br/>
list.  I was really excited about the possibility of being the first person<br/>
to plant a letterbox in a new country, but I was very aware of the security<br/>
risks it could pose not only for me and the box, but also for anyone else<br/>
who looked for it later.<br/>
<br/>
In the end I decided that I would probably not be able to safely leave a box<br/>
since the few places people could think of that were safe to leave things<br/>
were not as respectful of religious/cultural locations.  I ended up making<br/>
the decision to carve a nice dove stamp still that I took just in case of a<br/>
miracle, but I went with no expectations of actually being able to use it<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
My pleasant surprise came as I got to know a certain shopkeeper (who goes by<br/>
Baghdadi) who was just wonderful and had many connections with past visitors<br/>
from my university.  When I noticed that he had a wall that he kept business<br/>
cards and wedding invites from past customers, I gathered my courage and<br/>
explained letterboxing to him and asked how he felt about leaving a<br/>
microletterbox behind his counter or on the wall.  He was very happy to be<br/>
involved, so now I have the honor of being the first planter in Israel.<br/>
<br/>
Just a little while ago, I received a letter from Baghdadi talking about how<br/>
there is no tourism there now because of the hostilities and that he has<br/>
decided to sell some of his olive wood nativity sets to anyone that is<br/>
interested by mail (if anyone is interested contact me off-list, I would<br/>
love to help this sweet man) the thing that made me smile was that he<br/>
stamped my dove stamp on the top of the letter he sent me, so I know that he<br/>
still has the box there.<br/>
<br/>
I think you would be fine leaving letterboxes; you just need to be extra<br/>
careful about how you do it.  I wouldn't assume spots are okay.  Make sure<br/>
you get permission and the location is safe, or you can find a cooperative<br/>
businesskeeper like I did.  Then your boxes don't become a litter spot or<br/>
nuisance left in a strange land.  If they no longer wish to keep it, they<br/>
don't have to.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you!<br/>

I was so worried from the safety point of view should someone observe<br/>
you in the act of planting the box, and the box itself.  I thought<br/>
there was a good chance those actions would not be understood and be<br/>
perceived as a threat.  When you returned I read your post and found<br/>
your adventures in Jerusalem and with meeting the shopkeeper Baghdadi<br/>
delightful, but I never told you so and I'm sorry I didn't.  I'm so<br/>
glad you did what you did.      <br/>

somewhere near the 'triangle'.  I'll drop her a note to let her know <br/>
