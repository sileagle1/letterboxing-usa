                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Yes finally the weather and trail at Diana's Pool is somewhat <br/>
improved!  So save April 13 - Sunday at 1 p.m. to Meet the famous <br/>
Molly Dog and folow her on the trail to 3 boxes in her honor. For <br/>
those not familiar with  Molly's good deed. We had a winter gather at <br/>
Diana's Pool in honor of Butterfly's birthday.  The weather was <br/>
freezing and there was over a foot of snow.  At the end Butterfly had <br/>
lost her car keys. We searched and searched. Myself and  several <br/>
others. Then Chuck took Molly out to have another look and that <br/>
little dog walked right up and put her nose on those keys in the deep <br/>
snow! What a good dog and faithful letterboxer! So we put out 3 boxes <br/>
to  thank Molly and Chuck and Chickabirdie.  Of course they will have <br/>
the only clues that day and they will be posted after the event. So <br/>
join us on the trail.  We will have to park tightly and double up  if <br/>
there is over flow we will van pool others from the commuter lot <br/>
where  Paddle to the Sea and Falling Stars begins.  Come for the <br/>
three boxes and event stamp and all those wonderful exchanges. <br/>
   Directions: Diana's Pool is a well known eastern Ct. fishing spot <br/>
with scenic rapids deep in the Hemlocks.  Take Rte 6 to Chaplin  turn <br/>
onto Rte 198 Diana's Pool is down 198  1/4 to 1/2 mile on the right <br/>
note there is room for maybe 6-8 cars if we double up 12-14 and I <br/>
will van pool others to the site when we reach capacity parking. <br/>

have off together before the birds fly north for the summer and we <br/>
are hoping to have lunch at the Inn with the vulture and the other <br/>
birds. Sooooo if we can get up at a decent time and hit those, and <br/>
make it to Chaplin then Molly and Maddie can be the chocolate wonder <br/>
dogs!<br/>
<br/>
If not.... I'm sure there'll be other gatherings this year and we'll <br/>
catch up with those of you whom we did not meet at Kids day last <br/>
year.  <br/>
