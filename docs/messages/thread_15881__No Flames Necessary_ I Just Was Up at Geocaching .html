<br/>
I was reading their boards. I searched for the word "letterbox."<br/>
<br/>
The geocachers seem a tad confused about the difference between <br/>
letterboxing and geocaching. This of course is obvious since the <br/>
Catalina Fox stamp was taken by a geocacher. Some folks up there <br/>
think that a letterbox is simply a geocache without good GPS <br/>
coordinates. <br/>
<br/>
To my amazement, they also report that within about a yard of most <br/>
geocaches there is a letterbox. "Only so many good places to hide <br/>
something," they report. <br/>
<br/>
So, of course, I did a search by my zipcode. Sure enough, there are <br/>
over 300 geocaches within 50 miles of my house. I was horrified, to <br/>
say the least. That means that locations I have boxes, geocachers are <br/>
walking around in.<br/>
<br/>
When I saw that Princess Lea had written on her letterboxes "This is <br/>
NOT a geocache!" I thought it was in fun. Not anymore. I am now <br/>
writing that on every one of my plants in big, bold letters. I spend <br/>
too long designing, carving, placing, and writing clues for someone <br/>
to swap my stamp for a Walmart teddybear. I urge you to clearly label <br/>
your letterboxes similarly. <br/>
<br/>
I know that some of you indulge in both activities. If you do, please <br/>
take some time to explain to your geocaching compatriots that <br/>
letterboxes are different.  Yes, I know they complain that we do not <br/>
put our clues up easily (some had problems getting on this board and <br/>
others had trouble in the old days with the letterboxing dot org <br/>
site), and that we do not necessarily want everyone to find our <br/>
boxes. Right now in (area name removed) the park folks are kicking <br/>
geocachers and letterboxers out of public land. It is for all our <br/>
best interests that we are kind to each other, cooperative, and <br/>
discreet about our hobbies.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought, and it was supported on an earlier poll, keep <br/>
letterboxing separate from geocaching. Do not list our boxes over on <br/>
their site even if you do know the GPS location for it. There are <br/>
many more of the geocachers than there are of us. There seem to be <br/>
many more geocaches than there are letterboxes. Like it or not, we <br/>
have to cope with geocachers in the environment.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Sir Balthazar<br/>

Interesting timing there Sir Balthazar!<br/>
<br/>
    I was just over there this AM and wrote a bit about it on the PNW Forum.<br/>
For those that care to take a look, it's at:<br/>
http://www.myndworx.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;p=16#16<br/>
<br/>
But I agree.....  I am going to make sure that all of my boxes are clearly<br/>
labeled as to what they are NOT.  I do worry though, that it will not be<br/>
enough.  One shall never know.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As a couple, we like both letterboxing AND geocaching.  Therefore, <br/>
not ony do we find both, we hide both.  Most of our boxes are both as <br/>
only two beginner's caches have stamps, therefore theoretically, you <br/>
find the cache and stamp in you can claim it as a box.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there is a problem with stamps being traded out and we've have <br/>
had one traded for a State quarter!  I'm a new-age carver, instead of <br/>
chisels and redrubber--which I do have and know how to use--I use a <br/>
laser engraver.  My stamps are one-off, detailed stamps which I can <br/>
duplicate if needed.  Also, a trademark of ours is a custom acrylic <br/>
keyfob with the same image as the stamp for the First Finder.<br/>
<br/>
How we've pretty much solved the problem of trading out of stamps is <br/>
to put a note in the logbook which reads, in part, "Please use the <br/>
stamp to stamp YOUR logbook (Not this one) if you would like.<br/>
The stamp and inkpad are not trade items. They are for people who <br/>
collect ink impressions."  Probably should put a letterboxing sheet <br/>
in there, as well. :(  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we also mark the stamp and stamp pad with "THIS IS NOT A <br/>
TRADE ITEM!"  It's worked well so far.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don't care for this war between geocaching and <br/>
letterboxing.  I'm a techie, therefore I like gadgets.  I also bore <br/>
easily with walk-right-up-the-cache type of caches.  I like <br/>
challenging without having to feel like you're taking a Mensa test.<br/>
<br/>
While some people want to keep letterboxing and geocaching seperate, <br/>
if you read the FAQ at http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html -<br/>
 "Get the container itself and the logbook, and any other goodies you <br/>
want to put in the box," at least I get the sense that geocaching is <br/>
actually a sub-set of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing, and this is not a dig at geocachers, if you want to <br/>
hide a box near a cache, just make the hide very hard.  The vast <br/>
majority of cachers like easy.  The ones that like hard are either <br/>
already boxers or will soon be one. ;)<br/>
