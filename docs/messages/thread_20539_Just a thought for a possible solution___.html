                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all ...<br/>
I've been following the various threads over the past couple of <br/>
weeks, and have been honestly discouraged over the way things have <br/>
been going.  I came close to unsubscribing, then I realized that <br/>
with a group this big, you're bound to have differences of opinion.  <br/>
What matters is that we share a love of letterboxing, and want to <br/>
encourage responsible participation.  This may be the only common <br/>
thread we have in some cases.  I applaud all of you for holding firm <br/>
to your beliefs, no matter what side of the fence you're on.  And <br/>
I'm hoping with my idea that I'm not adding to the problem, but <br/>
maybe offering the idea for a solution???<br/>
<br/>
I belong to another group (medically-based) that has split into two <br/>
seperate but interconnected groups.  One is strictly for <br/>
information, while the other is more social/support oriented.  Most <br/>
people belong to both groups.  Or they select the group they're most <br/>
interested in.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm wondering (in my naivite) is that maybe something like that <br/>
would work for this group?  Have one group that deals strictly with <br/>
the release, locations, etc ... of letterboxes.  The other one would <br/>
be more for discussing issues relating to letterboxing in general.  <br/>
No specifics on individual boxes.  This way if we get into <br/>
other "discussions" where there are disagreements, there would be a <br/>
place for this seperate from the straight factual locations stuff.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a post designed to "split" any group by any means, or <br/>
undermine this group.  If this isn't practical, it won't offend me <br/>
in the least.  All I ask is that I not get large amounts of angry <br/>
mail - I though long and hard before posting this.  ;)  But I <br/>
thought I'd put the idea out there.  This is a great group, LbNA and <br/>
WoLB are both great sites and I'm proud and honored to be a member <br/>
of all of these.  My heartfelt thanks to the moderators and <br/>
webmasters for allowing us the chance to get to know each other and <br/>
express our views. <br/>
