But seriously folks...Bruce and I pick sites for a variety of reasons. <br/>
We are both history buffs, and there's so many historical sites around <br/>
here, that we've chosen a few for the interesting stories that can be <br/>
told. We've chosen some just because they're just cool, and with some <br/>
of the Camelot series, told some non-local stories with them. <br/>
And...well, that's been our particular focus, so that's about it...I <br/>
guess it's not a very wide variety of reasons with us...<br/>
<br/>
Let's ask Jay, he's the Master!<br/>
