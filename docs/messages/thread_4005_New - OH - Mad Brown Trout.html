Difficulty: 2 (Hard not to fish on the way to the letterbox)<br/>
Near: Urbana, Champaign County, OH<br/>
Placed 28 December 2001 by<br/>

There are only two rivers in Ohio that support trout populations.  <br/>
The spring fed Mad River is one's choice in southern Ohio.  The <br/>
section of the river you walk along for this letterbox is a very nice <br/>
trout environment.  This is where I caught my first ever brown trout. <br/>
<br/>
I have never been here when I did not see someone fishing.  Today, it <br/>
was 20 degrees and snowing.  There were 3 other cars in the lot.  I <br/>
saw one other fisherman wading the stream, one other besides me!  <br/>
Water temperature was in the mid 40s, and the waders kept me snug as <br/>
a bug in a rug. <br/>
<br/>
Parking is on the Northwest side of the US 36 bridge across the Mad <br/>
River about 3 miles west of Urbana.  Walk under the bridge and along <br/>
the path on the west side of the river.  Keeping your eyes open, you <br/>
are very likely to see flyfisherfolk regardless of weather or <br/>
darkness.  Walking down stream, south, about a half mile, you reach <br/>
an abandoned railroad bridge.  Just before the bridge, several <br/>
improvements have been made in the stream to make it easier for the <br/>
river to support our local trout population.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to dip your line.  Remember your fishing license (they <br/>
check) and the legal limits.  Even better, just release the purty <br/>
lil' feller you catch and I'll catch him too.  <br/>
<br/>
Abandon the path under the bridge and work your way to the northwest <br/>
corner of the bridge.  On the top of the stone headwall, under a <br/>
circular steel disk and 3 rocks, lies the maddest trout you will ever <br/>
see.  <br/>
