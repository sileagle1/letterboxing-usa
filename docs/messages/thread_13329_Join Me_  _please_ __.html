<br/>
It has been a long time since I have done anything related to <br/>
letterboxing.  Dartmoor seems so long ago!  Since then I might have <br/>
found 10 letterboxes.  I have been stuck a little below 500F since <br/>
January!  It has been a very slow spring in terms of letterboxes.  I <br/>
was hoping to get back into the swing of things this Saturday.  I am <br/>
planning on starting in the early morning this Saturday to find some <br/>
boxes and enjoy the beautiful spring foliage.  I havn't planned where I <br/>
will start, but I was thinking the eastern side of CT is looking pretty <br/>
tempting.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone of my CT buddies would like to join me, please drop me a <br/>
line.  I would love to catch up with a few of my long lost friends over <br/>
an afternoon of hiking and searching for letterboxes!  I hope everyone <br/>
is safe and enjoying life.<br/>

Man are you going to be bombarded.  Hope I get my 2 cents in first.  I<br/>
would greatly suggest you come east of the river.CT. There are more<br/>
boxes in R.N now that you do not have [I checked !] then on to Salem /<br/>
Montville to meet at the mimi gather at the Cancer Walk that Steve ,<br/>
Heidi and Madras are walking , We have a new Nature Preserve now in<br/>
Salem , the Walden Nature Preserve by name, and there are already boxes<br/>
there and on Sat at the Cancer Walk, I am handing out the clues to five<br/>
more boxes [with a secret hint of another ]. From there a hop skip and<br/>
jump are the new ones in Bozra . Groton and etc.  At Five o'clock there<br/>
is a pot luck dinner [$4.00] hosted by the A.M.C. many of you may<br/>
already know about.It is off the Berlin Turnpike  As you also might<br/>
know, June 7 is CT. Trails Day  The program is all about Letterboxing in<br/>
the State Forests and I am hoping to have a bunch of us letterboxers<br/>
there as a show of support to the State Forest Program.  As far as I<br/>
know A.M.C. does not host hikes for letterboxing, but you know , we can<br/>
change that .!! Come on over Alan, we all miss you.<br/>
