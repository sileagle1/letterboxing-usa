                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a question about this unclaimed box.  We attempted it this <br/>
weekend, but ran into a few snags.  I am sure that we got the starting <br/>
clue right, but we had trouble with the second clue:<br/>
<br/>
2. east side of creek, about 180 paces downstream from the top of the <br/>
rapids.<br/>
<br/>
The problems we had were that the creek was dried up and not flowing at <br/>
all.  So, we couldn't tell which direction was "downstream", nor could <br/>
we tell where the "rapids" were to find the "top" of the rapids.<br/>
<br/>
Any further clues for us from someone that has visited this box?  We <br/>
looked around a bit for any other clues, but without the right starting <br/>
point, our searches were in vain.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
