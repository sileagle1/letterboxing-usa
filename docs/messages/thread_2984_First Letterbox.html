<div><strong>I planted my first letterbox today.  
( August 1 2001)It is in Goodwin State Forest, Hampton CT. in Windham County. 
Goodwin State Forest is on Potter Road in Hampton, 3 miles east of the 
intersection with Route 198 and !.4 miles west of the intersection with  
Route 97.</strong></div>
<div><strong>One day the Bear Family decided to go for 
a walk in the forest to have a picnic. Uncle Grizzly and his son Brown decided 
to join them there. Papa Bear led the way. Mama Bear and Small Bear followed 
him. They walked deep into the forest and found a lovely spot to have their 
lunch. After playing and relaxing all afternoon, they decided to head for home. 
Grizzly and Brown headed off in one direction and Papa, Mama, and Small Bear 
headed off in the other direction. Papa Bear decided to take a shortcut. After a 
short while they realized they were hopelessly lost. Papa Bear told his family 
not to worry because there would probably be some letterbox enthusiasts that 
were in the forest. A friendly little mouse tried to help them but he never 
really ventured too far from his home in the stone wall, so he didn't know which 
direction they should go. He did know where a computer was located and offered 
to go to it and post instructions on the internet so someone could find there 
bear family. Here is what he wrote: Turn on Potter Road from Route 6, park in 
the first lot on the right. Head down the path, past the information board, 
toward Pine Acre Pond. Go to the left when you spot 2 outhouses, down through 
the field and enter the Natchaug Trail. As you enter the woods, cross over 2 
crumbling stone walls. As you walk through a field of ferns, the trail bends to 
the right toward the water. Stay with the blue dotted trail as you enter an open 
space with a fallen tree. Head left along the waters edge. Cross over 3 small 
wooden bridges in a row. Walk past a small gray building on your right. Looking 
out at the water you will see a beaver home. Continue along this trail past a 
tree with a green "6" posted on it. When you see the clearing near the tree with 
a green "7" on it, you have arrived where the Bear Family had their picnic. 
Cross another small wooden bridge and be on the lookout for a place to learn 
about how lightning affects the habitat. When you find this information, head 
left with the water behind you. As you cross the first old wooden bridge, look 
to you left for the roots of a tree that has fallen down. There are a couple of 
trees that have fallen. look for the one closest to you. Go behind the roots to 
the base of the tree and look in the crevice to find the Bear Family Letterbox. 
Although it is a nice easy hike taking about 15-20 minutes to reach the 
letterbox, be cautious of the roots and rocks on the 
trail.          Wandering
