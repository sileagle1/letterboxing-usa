<br/>
So I am thinking of venturing out for this event....<br/>
Can someone please tell me what "house hidden" letterboxes are..<br/>
Was also just wondering who was planning on attending and what is on the<br/>
agenda for the day.<br/>
Are there any boxes hidden at this park already? Is anyone carving an event<br/>
stamp yet?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

One letterbox in the park (about 30 in a 10 mile radius)<br/>
<br/>
Exchange signature stamps, meet with other letterboxers, if you want <br/>
to exchange carving ideas/hints/clue writing ideas, etc. you're more <br/>
than welcome to...<br/>
