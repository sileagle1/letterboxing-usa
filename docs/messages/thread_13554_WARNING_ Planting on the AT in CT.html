                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been hiking and camping since I was a little child (at 25 some <br/>
people say I still am!).  The stretch of the AT that runs through <br/>
Connecticut is one of my favorite places to hike!  I think planting <br/>
letterboxes here would be a great idea ... however ... take this story <br/>
to heart before you go off planting boxs.<br/>
<br/>
A few summers ago I invited my little brother Jonathan (Eagleboxer2002) <br/>
to use my maps and plan a hike on the AT.  He selected a nice stretch <br/>
of the AT that begins at 'Pine Knob Loop' and ended after 20 miles.  <br/>
The day was beautiful and we were hiking hard with Jonathan setting the <br/>
pace.  Suddenly I heard something and screamed for Jonathan to stop <br/>
moving.  Six inches from his leg was a very large rattle snake curled <br/>
up showing it's fangs and rattling it's tail as hard as it could.  <br/>
Using my hiking stick to distract it, Jonathan snuck back a good <br/>
distance and we sat to watch it leave.  This snake was more than 4 feet <br/>
long.  We warned all the hikers we saw along the way.  One guy told us <br/>
he had seen as many as 10 others along the trail that same morning.  <br/>
While (Thank God) nothing actually happened, I saw the life of my <br/>
little brother flash before my eyes.  There was no way I could have <br/>
carried him the remaining 5 or 6 miles to my car.  That experience is <br/>
burned in my head as the scariest of my life.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE ... consider where you place letterboxes in this area ... No <br/>
Rock Walls ... you would reach in and come out with a very different <br/>
suprise than you were looking for!  The 'Purple-Heart' letterbox is one <br/>
stamp you don't want in your journal!!!<br/>
