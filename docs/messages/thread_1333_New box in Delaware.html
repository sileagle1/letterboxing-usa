When Katie Burton was but a wee lassie her father sailed off to the new world in search of riches.  Whenever Katie would ask about him her mother would reply, "Nothing ventured, nothing gained." After her father found his fortune he hid it on an island on the Delaware seashore where he soon became ill. On his dying bed he sent his family a letter with directions to the treasure he had saved. He wrote that they should begin their search in the ocean city in the land of Mary. So after scraping together the fare to the new country they sailed off in search of their inheritance. His instructions were to go north on the number one road and cross over the Indian River Inlet and proceed around to the west side of the route past fishing vessels docked at the water's edge and stored on land.  They continued on to the end where they could leave their carriage and begin their quest on foot. Katie's mother pointed to a footbridge and declared "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it." !<br/>
After passing the fishermen on t<br/>
he bridge and walking through the sand they came to a fork in the trail. Once again in her wisdom the mother said. "You take the high road and I'll take the low and I'll get there before ye." So Katie, took the road to the right and her mother set off to the left. As Katie followed the path through to marsh and woods she crossed over a boardwalk where she saw an Osprey overhead. Continuing on she spotted a Golden Crowned Kinglet and thought this must surely be a sign. So she followed it over the second boardwalk. At the end of the boardwalk the Kinglet landed and began to hop 65 paces ahead on the trail. There it stopped and flew up into a curious looking tree on the left side of the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Katie's mother was a few feet up the trail resting against a very large tree. Katie called her mother to join her to look at the curious tree with the large arch coming out from it about waist high and a large tangle of exposed roots at its base. The little bird kept hopping up and down inside the tree at about chin height. Katie reached inside and lo and behold she found the treasure, where upon, her mother declared "a bird in hand is worth two in the bush."<br/>
