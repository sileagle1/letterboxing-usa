Here Comes the Sun<br/>
Placed: August 25, 2002, by Cattales<br/>
Location: Seneca Creek State Park, Germantown, MD (Montgomery County)<br/>
Difficulty:  Moderate (about 3/4 mile walk to the letterbox mostly in <br/>
the woods; some parts hilly and sunny)<br/>
<br/>
Note: Although the day use area of the park has an entrance fee, you <br/>
don't go to the entrance booth for this letterbox.  The search starts <br/>
at the Visitor's Center at which there is no fee.<br/>
<br/>
Bring a small backpack with a light picnic lunch and some water.  Take <br/>
a break and eat by the creek before the return journey.<br/>
<br/>
About Seneca Creek State Park: The park, about 7,000 acres, extends <br/>
along 12 scenic miles of Great Seneca Creek, as it winds its way to <br/>
the Potomac River.  The Day-Use Area (fee required) contains many <br/>
scenic areas, including the 90-acre Clopper Lake, surrounded by <br/>
forests and fields.  Picnicking, boat rentals, trails and a tire <br/>
playground are just some of its recreational opportunities.  Part of <br/>
the trail is marked for Volksmarchers.<br/>
*********************************************************************<br/>
Directions to Here Comes the Sun<br/>
<br/>
Go to Seneca Creek State Park in Germantown, Maryland.  Enter Seneca <br/>
Creek State Park from Clopper Rd.  Immediately after entering the <br/>
park, make the first right turn to the Visitor's Center (no fee).  <br/>
Park in that parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the "Old Pond" path that starts behind the left side of the <br/>
Visitor's Center.  After crossing the first wooden foot bridge, turn <br/>
right at the "T" intersection.  Follow the gully and continue over the <br/>
second bridge through the woods to the third bridge.  By now, you are <br/>
under the sun and the towers of power and maybe at the "Old Pond."<br/>
<br/>
Turn left and follow the path over the fourth bridge up the hill until <br/>
the main path veers left back onto the woods.  Continue by taking the <br/>
side path on the right down to the steep hill.  Close to Great Seneca <br/>
Creek, there is a large V tree with a red trail marker.  To the right <br/>
are a couple of large rock outcrops-a lovely place to picnic after <br/>
finding the box.<br/>
<br/>
To the left, along the creek bank, you should see two beaver-chewed <br/>
tree stumps, about 10 to 20 feet apart, or so, more or less.  You're <br/>
almost there.  Walk along the path to just past the second stump.  On <br/>
the left is a path going uphill to nowhere.  But, there at the end, at <br/>
the base of a large rock (about 3 by 6 feet), under leaves and a small <br/>
rock, there you will find the sun.<br/>
