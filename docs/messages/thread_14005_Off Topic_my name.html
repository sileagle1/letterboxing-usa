name. I know of several other Ailis, at least 2 others in my very own <br/>
state of Connecticut (I'm not part of Mary &amp; Aili's Restaurant in <br/>
Colchester), and several more in Maine, Florida and Minnesota (all <br/>
places you'd find a concentration of Finns). Also, out of about 10 <br/>
known Ailis, only one is related (the aunt I was named after...that'd <br/>
be Auntie Aili).<br/>
