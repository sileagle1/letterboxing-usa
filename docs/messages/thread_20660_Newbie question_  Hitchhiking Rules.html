Hey, I'm a newbie to this, and I just found my first hitchhiker.  It <br/>
was an AWESOME find, but I'm struggling with an etiquette question.  <br/>
Maybe somebody can help me out.<br/>
<br/>
The hitchhiker (HH) has a request that it end up in Hawaii.  (It is <br/>
in memory of somebody's Aunt, so it's a noble request.)  I know of <br/>
some friends of mine that are going to Hawaii soon, and I can <br/>
probably ask them to drop off the HH.  They don't letterbox, but they <br/>
are REALLY nice people.  However, I was the one who found the HH and <br/>
I do plan on going letterboxing pretty soon.  All stuff about Hawaii <br/>
aside, is it bad etiquette to "fix" the next plant for a HH?  Are <br/>
there rules out there that the HH must travel from place to place vs. <br/>
from place to person to person to place?  <br/>
<br/>
I looked up a few hitchhiker sites and couldn't get a clear answer to <br/>
my question.  I want to do this by the rules, so please respond in <br/>
the next week or so; my next letterboxing trip is coming up soon!<br/>

The only rule is that there are no rules! <br/>
<br/>
Do what you feel comfortable with.  If you wish to have someone <br/>
deposit it in Hawaii, then that's fine! <br/>
<br/>
Your other option is to email the HH owner and ask their opinion <br/>
directly and determine their wishes....<br/>

Personally, if time allows, I would e-mail the placer. They may want <br/>
the HH to travel to as many places as possible before getting to <br/>
Hawaii.<br/>
