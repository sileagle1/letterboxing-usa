<br/>
We were all very happy to have found her and will be depositing the HH some <br/>
where special in another east coast location soon!<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, Miss Ma had handed the HH back to me before she went &gt;splat&lt; in the <br/>
big (I mean big) mud puddle at the bottom of the field.  It was a true I <br/>
Love Lucy moment!  Never a dull moment but the pearly whites still shone in <br/>
a smile through the muddy little face!  Gotta love em both -- they've got <br/>
spirit (just as long as they ride their muddy selves home in Daddy's car...) <br/>

Can't do our counts yet 'cause we're too busy adding up all our exchanges <br/>
from yesterday  :-)<br/>

&gt;an opinion.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have found hitchhikers in my letterboxes while checking them out. I do <br/>
&gt;all the necessary stamping, count them as finds, take tem and leave them at <br/>
&gt;another box. I do write in the log book that I found it while checking my <br/>
&gt;boxes. Sometimes I even put them in another one of my own letterboxes. So, <br/>
&gt;my answer is yes count it as a find but you do have to get the stamp image <br/>
&gt;in your book and your stamp image in the HH book. That's what I do <br/>
&gt;anyway.....Chuck and Molly<br/>

&gt;question.  While checking the status of one of my own letterboxes, I<br/>
&gt;found, to my surprise, that the last finder had planted a Hitchhiker<br/>
&gt;in my letterbox.  I've never found a Hitchhiker before, and am<br/>
&gt;thrilled at this discovery, and very covetous of the stamp, but I'm<br/>
&gt;not sure this find qualifies.  After all, I certainly didn't discover<br/>
&gt;this letterbox, and I didn't have my stamp and logbook with meI was<br/>
&gt;just checking on one of my letterboxes.  Is it okay for me to claim<br/>
&gt;the Hitchhiker, stamp it into my stampbook as a found LB, and plant<br/>
&gt;it in my next discovered LB??  I'd like your opinion.  As of now, I<br/>
&gt;left the Hitchhiker in my LB for the next person to find.  (Am I<br/>
&gt;being too serious for even asking this question??)<br/>

Sounds like you had a great kids day! Thanks for sharing.:)<br/>
