first finder of their box.  I have found boxes that contained gift <br/>
certificates for a local coffee shop or local ice cream shop and I <br/>
have found little "FunHogs" from boxes by FunHog out here in the <br/>
Pacific Northwest.  I also have put little gifts in my Lewis and <br/>
Clark Mystery Boxes for the first finders!<br/>

<br/>
&gt; As for first finders...  perhaps once you have reached the point of <br/>
&gt; finding several hundred boxes the thrill of being the first one to <br/>
&gt; stamp into a box loses it's excitement, but as a newbie, I got a <br/>
bit <br/>
&gt; of an extra rush when I came upon a clean log book in the 3rd box I <br/>
&gt; hunted, and proudly noted this in the brief comments I left.  I <br/>
like <br/>
&gt; the idea of a First Finders Certificate, and am toying with this <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; a future plant.  Is this making changes to the hobby?  I don't <br/>
think <br/>
&gt; so, rather it is playing with creativity and every box already has <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; differing level of creativity -- themes, hand-carved stamps, custom <br/>
&gt; made and designed log books, etc.<br/>
