You could also try checking the old site (the link can be found on the landing page of the current site) to see if any are listed there.  I would also try searching the Yahoo! group archive to see if there are any clues posted there.<br/>

&gt;   Yes, but ...I know there are mystery boxes in Virginia, yet none are<br/>
&gt; listed in the<br/>
&gt;   mystery section.<br/>

Where in VA are you located? I'm near Fredericksburg. I haven't found them, <br/>
but I think I have at least solved some of the puzzles for a few boxes in <br/>
Virginia. I just hope they are still out. I found the clues to VA mystery boxes at  <br/>
<a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxByRegion.asp?region=Mystery">letterboxing.org - Mystery Letterboxes</a> . You have to page down to the VA <br/>
section, since it lists all the letterboxes together (I think) .<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps~!<br/>
Happy Letterboxing!<br/>

We haven't been at it very long either, only about a week. The kids and I are <br/>
hoping to come down that way this fall, after the crowds slow down some, and <br/>
camp and do some boxing in the Virginia Beach area. Perhaps we could meet and <br/>
exchange stamps! <br/>

    Did you have any success in Redwing Park? That was the first place we <br/>
tried and of the 3 that were supposed to be there we found one and the stamp was <br/>
missing. There were some disgruntled notes from others looking for the "Metal <br/>
Bridge" which apparently no longer exists, in the box but no stamp.<br/>

yesterday, with not much success. The rain held off just enough for us to<br/>
finish. That was the only plus. We could not find little diva, though we did<br/>
some serious rock removal and replacement, and imagine our great surprise to<br/>
discover that not only was garden gnome 2 gone, but also the entire bridge!!<br/>
Redwing was there alas with out the stamp, and the box was soaked, and<br/>
rather smelly. I saved the stamped papers and have them laid out to dry, and<br/>
plan to replace them shortly in baggies. To bad about the stamp though, as<br/>
it was a great location, with good clues. I hope to find the boxes owner and<br/>
ask them about replacing the stamp, or if they prefer, we could adopt it,<br/>
and attempt the stamp ourselves. We were thinking we were so clever when we<br/>
found it too! LOL! We have been working on flying valentine too, but we<br/>
don't get past the first hint, before the bickering starts between my 13 &amp;<br/>
10 year old! LOL! We did attempt First Landing, but we made the mistake of<br/>
taking our elderly dog, and we couldn't even make it to the 2 mile marker on<br/>
cape Henry with her. We were doing hot spot. So we will have to attempt it<br/>
again at a later date, after tropical storm who ever goes by! LOL! Hope you<br/>
have a fantastic day, Lone Pony<br/>
