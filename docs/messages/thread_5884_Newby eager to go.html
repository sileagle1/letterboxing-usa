                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well Sunday I was working at our club horse show.  The ranger asked <br/>
me "Did you know we have a letterbox in the park?"  (Bridle Trails SP <br/>
Kirkland WA)<br/>
<br/>
I had read the Smithsonian magazine article but never thought beyond <br/>
it.  I was instantly eager to go find the box.<br/>
<br/>
She gave me the directions and I could go right to it.  I meet the <br/>
woman who placed the box on my way back down the trail.  Having no <br/>
book with me I stamped a name badge I had on.  She saw the stamp and <br/>
said "I see you visited my box"<br/>
<br/>
I am thrilled to become absorbed in this activity.  As an avid <br/>
birdwatcher and ex-orienteer I find this just the right combination.  <br/>
I was never really very good at Orienteering as I was always <br/>
distracted by the birds.<br/>
<br/>
So I just finished my stamp and will visit my neighborhood park where <br/>
there are two boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I sent the web site link to my brother and I am sure he and his wife <br/>
will soon be Letterbox devotees.<br/>
<br/>
I am already formulating an idea for a series of Hitchikers.<br/>
<br/>
So Cheers everyone and I hope to meet you on the trail.<br/>

I just recently visited the Bridal Trails box myself.<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to see the boxes you put out.<br/>

Enjoy!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not to "toot my own horn" but this " Hidden Pond" hike is one of our<br/>
favorites. Too bad the pond is a dead one. ( I think I have heard<br/>
something like) "The surrounding rocks take the oxygen out of the water<br/>
and so it goes" We searched for this place many times before we found it.<br/>
Not an easy place to find , it is at about a 900 ft  elevation. The other<br/>
day it was about 75 degrees there with nearly no flys or insects of any<br/>
kind while it was in the  high 80's at the bottom of the mountain.  You<br/>
will be traveling through a tremendous amount of flowering mountain<br/>
laurel ( white &amp; red)  , way over your head ,  Enjoy!<br/>
