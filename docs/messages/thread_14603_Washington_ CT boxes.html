She was kind enough to assist me in finding The Unicorn Forest; The Bee Brook Box; Steep Rock Box and the last box of the Shepaug Serpent.  What a beautiful area!  I had found Fred the day before.  All boxes were in great shape.  Irishcod- thank you again for your help.  It was an enjoyable time.  Let us know when you plan to come to Mansfield.   Katie<br/>
