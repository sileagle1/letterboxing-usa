                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Tom, I'll cross the Split Rock box off my list.  Not too much <br/>
to choose from up this way...  Earlier this summer we were on <br/>
vacation in Door County, WI, which would have been a veritable <br/>
letterbox feast (in mid-western terms), particularly since we visited <br/>
all of the places and trails where boxes are planted!  If only we had <br/>
become familiar with the hobby before the trip and not a week after <br/>
our return.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we are just going to have to do something about the lack of <br/>
boxes around here ;-)  What's that they say, "If you build it, they <br/>
will come?"<br/>

and find those.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, your Chicago letterboxes were our initiation -- our first two <br/>
boxes while visiting last weekend.  Great locations.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
And as an aside...  I have just finished carving my first stamp, and <br/>
at the risk of sounding totally arrogant, am quite pleased with the <br/>
effort, primitive though it may be.  Anyone who thinks they are <br/>
hooked on this just hunting and planting boxes, try your hand at <br/>
carving a stamp...  you will be hopelessly obsessed!<br/>

Which one is Fumee Creek?  I remember looking a good long while at a<br/>
rest area June 2001 with no luck (and lots of poison ivy), but found<br/>
the other two in the area with no problems.<br/>
