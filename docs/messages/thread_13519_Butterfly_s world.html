I was intrigued by Butterfly's comment on being deaf (because I know a little <br/>
American Sign Language--ASL) and had sent a message offline.  Here's the very <br/>
interesting answer:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wild Woman<br/>
Yes, I live in a lovely quiet almost silent world., punctuated by sound<br/>
via aids !!  However, as a word of caution, I lip read even across a<br/>
crowded room !!!<br/>
Yes, I too sign somewhat from classes in ASL although with no one to<br/>
sign with, it quickly falls short.  Twice on the trails I have encounter<br/>
Deaf [hearing impaired-2003 !!] folks. Once was great fun as it was a<br/>
man with a wonderful black lab.  He was so happy to bump into someone<br/>
who could sign. We did the usual 'what is your name ' kind of talk, but<br/>
it was interesting.  Another time a young boy [could mouth words] with<br/>
his Mom who only signed , they were lost on the Quinnipiac trail - lost<br/>
in the sense they were going the wrong direction from what they<br/>
intended. That was a nice feeling to get them on their way. ASL is a<br/>
wonderful tool that is taught more and more because it is a universal<br/>
language. I was told by one teacher, that it is the third most used<br/>
language in the world .<br/>
Thank you for asking. Now more folks will understand and not think I am<br/>
ignoring them if they speak to me and I do not answer.<br/>
Hope I bump into you on the trails.<br/>

My daughter chose to take ASL as her 'foreign language' in high <br/>
school/college. She had always been fascinated by it and found that our jr. college system <br/>
(in the Sacramento CA area) gave several classes in it including 'Deaf <br/>
Culture". When she first suggested this 'deaf culture', I was confused. How could <br/>
there be a whole other 'culture' of, I don't know. . .Americans? Over the months <br/>
of these classes, I've learned a great deal and I am now fascinated too with <br/>
the differences of 'your' world. My daughter attended 'deaf events' where there <br/>
are people signing all over the place and has happened upon 'signers' in her <br/>
travels and is always excited when she can translate and speak with them.<br/>
<br/>
It only goes to show you, there are so many things to learn about and think <br/>
about right under our noses in this world!! I know my daughter (one month shy <br/>
of 18) would love to try out her ASL on you if we should ever meet. She plans <br/>
to join a sorority at CSU Fullerton whose emphasis is on the hearing impaired <br/>
and to continue studying ASL in hops of working at Disneyland some day using <br/>
ASL as they are sorely lacking in  deaf translators.<br/>
<br/>
More than you wanted to know, I know, but . . .had to share.<br/>
