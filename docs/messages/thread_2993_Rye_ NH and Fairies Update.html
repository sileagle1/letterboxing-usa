Yesterday I went to find the Fairies of Borderland. What great clues <br/>
and hike! Serenity has had a lot of visitors; Love and Peace have had <br/>
a few.  I was unsuccessful in finding Hope and Joy. I thought I was <br/>
at the right spots but found nothing. Has anyone found them lately? <br/>
Still, I was happy to find serenity, love and peace. Thanks for a <br/>
nice day!<br/>

We have to do that trip again because we couldn't find 2 of them! 
I'm happy to know that it was just us and the boxes weren't missing. 
I don't know what our problem was that day, but we'll try again. 
We planted a 4th box there, but I haven't gotten around to writing the
clues.  Someday...

<div>Hi Betsy</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Fairies are one of my series. The last time I 
checked was in early April. At that time they were all there.</div>
<div>Hope and Joy were hidden among medium sized stones. 
Joy would be the one that might go missing due to its proximity to a popular 
site. I do hope they are not missing, will try to check soon.</div>

Yes, Joy may very well be missing.  My friend Kim and I found the <br/>
other four this past Sunday.<br/>
