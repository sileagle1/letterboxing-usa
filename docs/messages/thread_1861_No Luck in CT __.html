came up empty handed.  We started at the Rensalear Box in Glasonbury,<br/>
what a terrific park, the first park we've encountered with tons of dogs<br/>
(and their owners) but none of the droppings (probably because of the<br/>
big sign and the stock of baggies at the entrance. We had no problems<br/>
following the clues and suspect the box is hidden under the frozen<br/>
earth, although if there's anyone out there who has found this box, we'd<br/>
appreciate a hint about how far and which side of the trail the tree<br/>
with the 'v' is :) From Glasonbury we headed to Waterford (it was a nice<br/>
day for a drive), searched for "The Wall", feel like we definitely found<br/>
the WALL (WoW!!!), but couldn't find the box, however we did attract<br/>
some attention!  Then we gave "Summer Music" a twirl, thought we had a<br/>
good lead on it, but again no luck.... No boxes but good company and<br/>
fresh air and exercise.  Annie B (1/4 of the Elements of Hiking vowing<br/>
to search only for boxes that were planted after the ground froze and<br/>
the snow fell in CT)<br/>

    We too have tried for the wall, though not too hard because of the<br/>
location.  We felt a little strange poking around there for too long!  Good<br/>
luck on Summer Music, we are still pretty clueless :)  By the way thanks for<br/>
the idea you guys gave us on Ray's.  We think we've found the spot, but<br/>
still came up empty handed.  Does anyone out there know if it's still<br/>
there??<br/>
<br/>
    This weekend we went up to Pomfret to find the camera and film and the<br/>
table.  What a great place to hike!!  The first box was very frozen in.  If<br/>
anyone had seen us chipping away at the rock and then Dan tossing a log on<br/>
it to loosen it up they would have thought we were nuts.  Luckily no one<br/>
did, so the secret is still safe!  Dan and I, and Dan's sister were the<br/>
first visitors since Debbie's mom back when it was planted.  More people<br/>
should head up that way, it's a great place.  Although I would recommend<br/>
4-wheel drive for the snowy road it.  They don't plow it.  We also checked<br/>
out the Wolf Den-very cool-a great place for a letterbox!<br/>
    Today we opted for a shorter hike in RI.  Since we got a new puppy last<br/>
night we wanted to find a hike that wouldn't be too tough, but would get him<br/>
used to walking on a leash.  We visited the Kurdziels' Dolphins at Daybreak.<br/>
Another really great place.  We hiked out to the point and noticed several<br/>
people looking out at the water with binoculars.  So we were curious and got<br/>
out ours.  Guess what we saw!!  Two seals laying on the rocks!  What a<br/>
sight!!  We definitely haven't seen anything like that around here before.<br/>
Our puppy Max loved all the dead leaves!!<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone had a great letterboxing weekend,<br/>

I am glad that you were lucky enough to see the seals.  It is an <br/>
amazing location that even local residents don't know about or have <br/>
never visited.  I just hope that RI is able to buy it and turn it <br/>
into a state park before it is all lost.  It is definitely a gem.  <br/>
Also, there are several trails through there that are good for <br/>
mountain biking and hiking, and you can rent kayaks in Wickford and <br/>
paddle down to it.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I have to ask, didn't you like the story?  I will never be able <br/>
to make my living as a writer but I was rather proud of the tale...<br/>

Yes!!!  We thought the story was great and very funny too!  I have to admit<br/>
