<br/>
What an amazing day.  If you had told me that forty to fifty people would<br/>
show up, in the rain, for an outdoor event -- the invitation to which<br/>
required more than a few firing neurons to decifer -- I might not have<br/>
believed you.  Yet the proof is in my stamp log in the form of 35<br/>
exchanges (several folks who came had exchanged with me on previous<br/>
occasions).<br/>
<br/>
Even before I arrived at the gathering I managed to bag Dancing Men, Pine<br/>
Barrens of RI, and Li'l Rhode-ster.  Once there, I and most everyone else<br/>
got Alicia's Boo! box, Jay Drew's Nibiru, and Laurette's<br/>
beautifully-carved Canonicus.<br/>
<br/>
Alas, Rustypuff (aka Kim) was unable to come as she had to work, but she<br/>
did send along the Traveling Matrioshka, which was produced for anyone<br/>
who knew the magic words.  There were at least two other travelers at the<br/>
gathering, but I will refrain from describing them, as they belong to<br/>
other letterboxers and may show up again at a later date.<br/>
<br/>
Alafair's Mystery Gathering event stamp was another highlight of the day,<br/>
as was a visit from the famous Flutterby and K-Martha stamps, which I<br/>
understand were sent along by Legerdemaine.  The Roving Pacific Northwest<br/>
Event Stamp mysteriously appeared on the table in front of me at one<br/>
point.  I don't know where it came from, but I was happy to take an<br/>
impression of it.<br/>
<br/>
Even now that it's over, I'm not sure if I should reveal the secret<br/>
identities of the event organizer and the "mysterious visitor," so I<br/>
won't.  I'll just leave that for someone else.  But I would like to<br/>
extend a big thank to the one and express my pleasure at having met the other.<br/>
<br/>
Again, a great day!  Now for a nice, hot shower!<br/>

We finally made it back up north after stopping off for dinner and to <br/>
warm up, but I finally looked in my log book and counted 37 stamp <br/>
exchanges :) Yeah!<br/>
I was asked by Tom No One to make a human traveler stamp, which <br/>
started out as the Letterbox Fairy. It quickly turned into the "Bad <br/>
Joke Fairy" and I think she might be flitting along to other areas. <br/>
Just wanted to say thanks for the food and company! And, remember <br/>
Warrior Woman, we are laughing WITH you...not at you :) <br/>

I cannot believe that I actually got 2 Event Stamps, 8 Found stamps <br/>
(boxes and travelers, and I only did the boxes at the event! - I <br/>
guess I was lucky with many magic words, including lettuce alone ;-)),<br/>
and 42 eXchanges.<br/>
<br/>
And to those of you who did meet me, I have plenty to laugh at myself <br/>
about, and I am good at it!  But laughing with me is even more fun!<br/>
<br/>
A fabulous time for all!  I even found a home for all that leftover <br/>
Indian Pudding!<br/>
<br/>
I still feel like I just went to the greatest rock and roll event <br/>
ever, and I got the autographs of many many many letterboxing "stars".<br/>
