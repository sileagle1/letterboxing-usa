                    <html><body>Hi everyone!<br/>
We are new to this sport and already are hooked.  We live in Florida.  We learned about it during the recent Michigan Dog Scout Letterboxing Event, and are trying to find all the ones near us.  This past weekend, we were down in South Florida and had the opportunity to hunt for the "Shh - It's a Secret" box, which we found.  It's in good condition, and in a beautiful spot.  The stamp is really cool!<br/>
We also looked for the "Loggerhead" letterbox, which we were not successful at locating.  Could the Terrapin Travelers contact me privately?  I have a question about this one.  <br/>
Anyway, it is exciting to read about all the activity in the north.  I hope we can get many more boxes down this way!<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

<br/>
welcome to the addictive sport of letterboxing.  I am going down to <br/>
Florida in March and hope to do some letterboxing while I'm down <br/>
there.  I live in Rhode Island &amp; take my 3 black labs out with me all <br/>
the time.  The pups are staying home though during my vacation so it <br/>
will just be me &amp; Mr. Grumpy Turtle (aka my boyfriend) down in FL.<br/>
<br/>
happy trails,<br/>
