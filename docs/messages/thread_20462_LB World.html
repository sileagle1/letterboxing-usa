This assumption that it's coming from some rival faction here is just<br/>
as despicable. There is indeed a lot of history that I won't and don't<br/>
want to recall here but perpetuationg what has only been an opinion<br/>
and/or speculation that the attacks come from here serves no purpose<br/>
unless that purpose is to promote divisiveness and suspicion. There<br/>
are thousands of random attacks on web sites every day and leaping to<br/>
the conclusion that someone is out to destroy WOL out of some<br/>
malicious intent only fuels factionalism and suspicion. Pillory the<br/>
offender when and if one is found but don't bandy about erroneous<br/>
speculation and false accusations.<br/>

This is exactly what I was refering to, I know you enjoyed the WOL<br/>
site and were a frequent poster there so I understand that your upset,<br/>
but could you please offer evidence instead of saying that you "think<br/>
some of the powers to be around here think they own letterboxing." The<br/>
implication in this can hardly be denied. The fact that you don't<br/>
explicitly make an acusation doesn't make this any less an accusation.<br/>
As I said earlier you can pillory the offender when they are<br/>
identified but this speculation will never help heal any wounds.<br/>

<br/>
We don't know who those destructive people are, so lets not start<br/>
hinting around that we do.  Just because there was some animosity in<br/>
the past is no reason to point fingers in accusation.  There is a huge<br/>
jump from angry words, to willful destruction of property.  And I want<br/>
to suggest to those who are thinking just that, to stop and ponder for<br/>
a moment all the implications.  Suppose you had harsh words with your<br/>
neighbor and the next month their house burned down under suspicious<br/>
circumstances.  Does that make *you* automatically guilty of arson<br/>
because of those angry words?  No.      <br/>

*grunts = have you ever watched John Wayne walk, especially in his<br/>
younger movies?  He looks like he has a massive wedgie.  We always<br/>
called him "Grunts" or "Old Grunts", although I can't remember why.<br/>
So undies became "grunts".   <br/>

This type of response is unfortunate, but not surprising.<br/>

This is probably a good time for someone who runs letterboxing.org to chime<br/>
in and inform the other users that they have good backup plans in case<br/>
something (heaven forbid) happens to their web site. Although hackers are<br/>
definitely one unfortunate occurrence on the 'net, a simple hard drive going<br/>
bad can wreak havoc on a web site without proper backup. Unfortunately far<br/>
too often, backup plans are overlooked until after the inevitable crash<br/>
occurs.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the rebuild. From experience I know how frustrating it can<br/>
get.<br/>

<br/>
I'll let Wes handle that since he knows more about the backup plans <br/>
for LbNA than I do.<br/>
<br/>
For Atlas Quest, I run nightly backups of all the data on it. I store <br/>
backups for the last 30 days, so if somehow the data was corrupted <br/>
for a few days--or even up to 29 days--I'd still have the latest copy <br/>
of good, clean data.  In theory, the hosting service it runs on is <br/>
supposed to be backuping up my account (including the backups!), but <br/>
I hate trusting someone else to do such a critically important thing, <br/>
so I download a copy of it every week or two and burn it to a non-<br/>
rewriteable CD at least once a month.  Which I never throw away.  I <br/>
can't imagine a worst-case scenario that would require me to use <br/>
backup data more than a month old, but heaven forbid if it ever came <br/>
to that, I'll be prepared.<br/>
<br/>
I can't guarantee Atlas Quest is safe from hackers--in fact, nobody <br/>
can guarantee a website is safe from hackers.  There are ALWAYS <br/>
vunerabilities.  However, the hosting service I use is very good <br/>
about installing newly released patches with 24 hours of when they <br/>
come out.  And because most hackers use already known vunerabilities <br/>
that any teenager can surf the web to learn about, the fact Atlas <br/>
Quest uses custom-made scripts is a great discouragement.  It's a <br/>
*lot* harder to find a vunerability when you actually have to figure <br/>
it out yourself than it is to use one that's publically announced on <br/>
the Internet.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, all sensitive information (such as passwords) are <br/>
encrypted before it's stored in the database, so if a hacker ever did <br/>
gain access to it, they'll still be left with a bunch of worthless <br/>
data.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, Atlas Quest pretty darn solid, but I still look for <br/>
weaknesses and vunerabilities.  It's a never-ending game, and you <br/>
lose if you get caught with your pants down.  I've logged more than <br/>
one attempt at someone trying to hack into Atlas Quest, but so far <br/>
nobody has succeeded in the attacks which I wrote off to random <br/>
attacks that happen all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, given enough time, someone will probably succeed.  <br/>
Statistically speaking, it's guaranteed.  Every website out there <br/>
will get hacked eventually.  Depending on the severity and timing of <br/>
the attack, Atlas Quest might lose anywhere between one day to two <br/>
weeks of data.  But I'll never have to start over again from <br/>
scratch.  I'd rather throw in the towel completely than start over <br/>
again from scratch, so I've taken extensive measures to make sure <br/>
such an event will never happen to Atlas Quest.<br/>

Backups by ISP every night.  I have a local copy of all the code, so <br/>
I just copy the database down every night.  Shoot, I think I've got a <br/>
copy of every night since we've started in December '02.  <br/>
<br/>
Our ISP doesn't seem to have problems with hackers.  Now, DNS servers <br/>
are a different story...<br/>
