If I read it right, I  think newsup8 was calling for a moratorium - a <br/>
temporary voluntary ban on talking with the press until the effects <br/>
of the current press can be evaluated.<br/>
<br/>
Since so many of us were brought into letterboxing by radio, tv or <br/>
newspapers, I think it would be silly to never do press.    But as <br/>
those of you who are familiar with marketing and publicity know, <br/>
these things have a way of snowballing.  A Time article leads to <br/>
a few dozen small newspaper articles, which leads to some TV <br/>
coverage and suddenly the cast of The Real World goes <br/>
letterboxing and a beer company is giving away free Rubbermaid <br/>
containers featuring their new lo-carb logo.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I would support temporary "cooling-off."  In fact, I will.<br/>
Is that Access Hollywood on the phone?  They want me to take <br/>
J-Lo letterboxing for a feature?  Sorry.  Not Interested.  <br/>
Letterboxing?  Isn't that when they put those black bands on <br/>
movies on my TV screen? <br/>
