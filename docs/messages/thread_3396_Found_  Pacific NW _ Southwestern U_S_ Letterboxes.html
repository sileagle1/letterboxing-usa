                    <div class="plaintext-content">My husband &amp; I have just returned from a 3-week travelling adventure <br/>
in OR, ID, UT, CO, and NV.  We had the pleasure of combining some <br/>
letterboxing with our other adventures.<br/>
<br/>
On 9/7, in Snake River Canyon, Idaho, we found Der Mad Stamper's <br/>
Raptor letterbox, and at dusk no less.  I said to Mark, "Did you <br/>
stick your hand in there?"  He said, "Yes."  But he stuck it in again <br/>
under my watchful eye and voila, he found our treasure.  We never did <br/>
see any raptors though...we got there too late in the day.<br/>
<br/>
On 9/8, in Promontory, Utah, we found another of Der Mad Stamper's <br/>
boxes - his Golden Spike letterbox.  We hiked the loop trail and it <br/>
was very interesting.  It looked like there had been a recent fire, <br/>
but we are happy to report that your box is safe &amp; sound.<br/>
<br/>
On 9/19, in Glenwood Canyon, Colorado, we found the Drew Clan's <br/>
Hanging Lake letterboxes (2).  We were the first to find these boxes <br/>
that were placed in July of 2000.  Hanging Lake &amp; the Spouting Rock <br/>
Waterfall are both very beautiful.  I'd recommend these hikes if you <br/>
ever get out that way. <br/>
<br/>
On 9/27, in Frenchglen, Oregon, we found Paisley Orca's Donner und <br/>
Blitzen letterbox.  We were the first letterboxes to sign in.  There <br/>
was a previous entry by some geocachers.  The hike along the river to <br/>
get to it was very peaceful &amp; green.  We had just been travelling in <br/>
the heat of the deserts throughout Utah &amp; Nevada and were quite happy <br/>
to walk in the shade and feel the pleasant coolness of the air. <br/>
<br/>
So...thanks to all for placing these letterboxes so that we could <br/>
enjoy them!!<br/>

What a great letterboxing adventure you've been on!  Such a variety of<br/>
stamps planted by different folks.  WAY COOL!  <br/>
<br/>
I'm glad someone has been down there to check out the Donner &amp; Blitzen<br/>
letterbox.  Not for the reason of stamping in so much as to get people<br/>
to go to this beautiful place, eh?  I'm glad you enjoyed yourselves!<br/>
New Zealand next for you guys still, eh?  We'll be heading there just<br/>
after Thanksgiving.  Got my passport in the mail just last week.<br/>
YIPPEE!!!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
