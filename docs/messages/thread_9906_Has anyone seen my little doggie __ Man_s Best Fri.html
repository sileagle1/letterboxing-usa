                    <div class="plaintext-content">Has anyone seen the hitchhiker --  Man's Best Friend lately?  I <br/>
launched this hitchhiker 9 months ago.  There were 2 reports on him <br/>
in April and no reports or postings on his whereabouts since April <br/>
28, 2002. Either he is missing in action or has been left in a really <br/>
cool spot that doesn't get many visitors.  If you have seen him <br/>
lately please email me at moonstone_baby@yahoo.com.<br/>
<br/>
thanks.<br/>
<br/>
a concerned mom.<br/>
