Seattle, WA<br/>
<br/>
 From downtown, take I-5 North to exit 170 (Ravenna Blvd).  Turn right <br/>
at the light onto Ravenna, and drive east.  After about 3/4 mile, turn <br/>
left on 20th Ave NE.  The street dead-ends in 1 block at the bridge over <br/>
the park and the entrance is at the right.<br/>
<br/>
(If you miss 20th ave NE and park at the playing fields, you can just <br/>
trek up the path north until you get to the main parking area.)<br/>
<br/>
 From the parking area, find the bathrooms.  On the northeast corner of <br/>
the grassy area are 2 picnic tables with two trails between them.  Take <br/>
the north trail, which is the one WITHOUT wood stairs.<br/>
<br/>
At the bottom of the ravine, go left, under the iron giant bridge to the <br/>
stairs just past, on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Down the wood stairs and across the wood bridge, and past the <br/>
heeeeeeyooooge boulder, cross the small wood bridge to your right, and <br/>
stop at the post on your left.  Go left onto the "north trail" up the <br/>
stairs, and take the left fork of the "Y".<br/>
<br/>
At the next Y, take the left path, and duck through the low foliage <br/>
tunnel into the clearing.  Pass the picnic table on your right and go <br/>
straight through the clearing past the old wrinkly tree.  See the post <br/>
ahead?<br/>
<br/>
Cross the service road to the post marked either 6a or 6d (depending on <br/>
which side you're looking at).  Follow the "NE 62nd" path north, up the <br/>
hill.<br/>
<br/>
As you approach the street, the main path goes left, with a smaller path <br/>
to the right, between two trees.  Take the right, smaller path, and <br/>
follow it up the VERY STEEP hill.<br/>
<br/>
When I say Very Steep(tm), I -mean- it.  Be careful.<br/>
<br/>
To the right of the path, nearly ten paces from the top, is a set of two <br/>
trees with about a large man's width between them.  Step between them <br/>
and forward about three paces ahead of you is a small tree that's <br/>
leaning over with all its bark stripped off.  At its base, nestled near <br/>
the root ball, is a grey stone.  Behind the stone and under some leaves, <br/>
is the letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
I'm a little worried about this one.  Let me know if you find it at <br/>
gypsy@moderngypsy.com.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And for those of you who aren't going to just drop everything and hop a <br/>
plane to Seattle, there are pictures of the boxes and stamps here:<br/>
