Just when I think it's really too hard to place lasting letterboxes <br/>
in urban areas I go to D.C. and see how many great ones have lasted <br/>
there, despite how busy their locations often are.  That being said, <br/>
I was mostly shunked.  I couldn't find Year of the Ram--but far be it <br/>
from me to say it's not there.  I know other people have commented on <br/>
how tricky the location is.  But I am quite convinced that <br/>
Independence is missing.   The directions were very clear, and the <br/>
grass where I'm sure it was supposed to be had been recently cut, so <br/>
I'm betting that one's just gone.  But it's a beautiful park I <br/>
othewise would have never visited.  On the other hand, what a great <br/>
location for The Inventor!  It was exactly where it was supposed to <br/>
be--with only one page left in the log.  Even though tour buses are <br/>
passing it every minute, I really think it will continue to stay <br/>
safe.  <br/>
      Then I went out to Bethesda and did some more with my sister.  <br/>
Lily of the Valley is right where it belongs and the stamp is a lot <br/>
of fun.  Thanks D and Shoo.  But we missed both of the Climber <br/>
Escapes boxes.  I think an extra tree has fallen in the first <br/>
location, making it hard to figure out where the original directions <br/>
were leading, and I'd left my compass in the car, so it's no surprise <br/>
that we missed the second one as well.  But it was a beautiful walk <br/>
and we talked about our father's love of fly-fishing.  He'd always <br/>
insisted that it wasn't about catching the fish--it was about being <br/>
in beautiful places.  A great philosphy, if not always 100% <br/>
workable!  <br/>
