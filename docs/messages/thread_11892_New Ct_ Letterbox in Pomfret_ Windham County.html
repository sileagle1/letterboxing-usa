<br/>
Planted by: Teach &amp; Preach (help from Little Piggy &amp; Nappy Kitty)<br/>
Location: Pomfret Ct.  Windham County<br/>
Rated: easy<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From the intersection of Rt. 101 &amp; Rt. 169 go north 169.  <br/>
Follow for .3 miles and turn into grassy parking area on the right.  <br/>
<br/>
Walk the grassy trail with the stream being on your right.  You'll <br/>
pass a tree house.  Walk over wooden plank and then a wooden bridge.  <br/>
Up a little hill.  At the T go left.  You'll walk through a stone <br/>
wall.  At that T go right.  Follow the path with a stone wall on your <br/>
right.  As you walk and the stone wall and path turn towards the <br/>
left.  There is a hugh (I think Oak) tree with a great big hole in <br/>
it.  The We The People Letterbox is behide the tree under 2 bricks <br/>
and sticks.  Be careful there is barbwire behind the tree.  <br/>
<br/>
