<div>Hi. My nieces and nephews just moved to Nebraska 
(southeast) Can anyone tell me the status of the boxes on the site? Are any 
missing that have not been taken off  yet? I thought this would be a neat 
way for them to learn about their new home. They just moved completely across 
the country. They don't have access to a computer right now so I am going to 
print them out. </div>

<p>Irishtinker,</p></div>
<p>     As far as I know all boxes listed on the site are still active with two exceptions. 1- Jewell Park is no longer out, I pulled that one earlier this spring. 2- Cornhusker box in Lincoln has been hunted unsuccessfully and is presumed missing. It is great to hear about more boxers moving to our state. Letterboxing is really starting to take off here in eastern Nebraska.</p></div>
<p>For a very up to date list visit Scott Redd's Wiki Site. I don't have the address handy at the moment, but if you go to my site shown below and go to the links page there is a link to his site there. It doesn't get more up to date than that, trust me.<br/></p>

As Erich posted earlier, letterboxing is starting to take off in <br/>
Nebraska.  It's great to know we may have added a couple more.<br/>
<br/>
All known Nebraska letterboxes, as well as some near Nebraska are <br/>
listed on a special Letterboxing Nebraska web site at <br/>
http://interbug.com/letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
The site is very "printer friendly", by the way.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few letterboxes around Lincoln, and many in Omaha.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I know myself and some of the others here in Omaha are <br/>
working up new boxes as we speak. *nudge nudge*<br/>
