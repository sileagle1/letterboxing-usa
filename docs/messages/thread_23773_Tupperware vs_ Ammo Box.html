                    <div class="plaintext-content">An ammo box can cause a no'xer to get bent out of shape because it is <br/>
just plain scary to them. Then they report the box to the Ranger <br/>
rather than just leaving it alone. <br/>
<br/>
For your first box, I'd stick with a container that blends into <br/>
surroundings as much as possible; select a dark colored, smallish <br/>
box. Don't re-use food containers; no odors. Do what you can to make <br/>
it less visible when exposed. Employ camouflaging techniques such as <br/>
camouflage tape, and wrap in burlap. <br/>
<br/>
Place the box far from any public area, deep in the woods, far off <br/>
the beaten path, away from the view of passers-by.<br/>
<br/>
The finder may not re-hide the box correctly, and leaves can blow <br/>
away. Begin with adequate coverage: e.g., wedge the box under a <br/>
boulder. Bushes can serve as a natural canopy; the finder should have <br/>
to get through brush to find the box. Don't be obvious, i.e., piling <br/>
a bunch of sticks in a straight row at the base of a tree.<br/>
<br/>
Try to hide the box in such a spot where the finder is comfortable <br/>
enough with the spot so that they don't have to be too hasty about <br/>
rehiding and do a poor job of it. Cover with a rock or burlap; the <br/>
finder should be able to understand how to use these to re-hide. Make <br/>
sure that any rocks used to cover the box are big enough and numerous <br/>
enough to do the job.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content"> The thing with ammo cans is that they are probably too large to be hidden properly unless placed in a correct location. Piles of sticks and rock cairns can stand out too much and will lead to missing boxes. After several boxing trips and experience, you can often walk right up to the exact spot when your eyes are trained to look for standouts in the woods. <br/>

     I am preparing my first box for placement. What is your opinion for the best <br/>
 letterbox container? Ammo boxes seem very sturdy and waterproof, but are <br/>
 they mostly used for geocaching? I've found a few tupperware boxes lately but <br/>
 the contents inside were soggy and messy? Just bad packaging? Your opinions <br/>
 would be appreciated.<br/>

<br/>
The critical issue for container selection is protecting the stamp and<br/>
logbook.  If you bag each of those and then place the two bags in a<br/>
heavy, double lock zip bag then you can put the "box" inside anything.<br/>
 I've used pieces of hollow log, mint boxes, cheese crocks and fake<br/>
rocks made of concrete.  I also like to build wooden boxes.  And don't<br/>
forget that all this started with a jar.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I think Rubbermaid/Tupperware boxes are boring.<br/>
<br/>
I would, however, never use an amunition box.  It is too big and looks<br/>
like an explosive device.  It will also attract every geocacher for 50<br/>
degrees around.<br/>
