  Unless, of course, you attempt to tackle Ryan of Portland's infamous <br/>
  &amp; sadistic Applegate Trail Rest Area Letterbox near Grants Pass, <br/>
  Oregon.  Then, you'll need a several thousand dollar nuclear powered <br/>
  military lensatic compass with laser guided precision, a GPS for <br/>
  back up accuracy, a full flood light since your hunt will take you <br/>
  well into the night regardless of when you begin &amp; numerous <br/>
  bottles/tubes of Zanfel/Technu for the almost assured miserable case <br/>
  of poison oak you'll catch when you give up 'dead reckoning' the <br/>
  various azimuths in the clues and then you surrender to the hunt &amp; <br/>
  peck method of finding the letterbox!  Truly sadistic, he is...  <br/>
