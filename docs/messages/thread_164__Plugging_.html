&gt;  Clues...what to do with clues?  Haven't really decided.  Even though I<br/>
&gt;  think it's unlikely that vandals seached the web for malicious ways to do<br/>
&gt;  mischief, I don't think it's impossible either.  I'd like to make it easy<br/>
&gt;  for interested people to get clues, but not so easy for others...still<br/>
&gt;  thinking about how to make that happen.<br/>

Julie,<br/>
There has been some real useful information from Adrian recently.  Some of it<br/>
you may have overlooked.  I'll recap it here:  A lot of the letterboxers in <br/>
Dartmoor are doing something called "plugging" in which you dig out a small,<br/>
circular piece of sod (a "plug") just larger than the letterbox to be placed<br/>
inside.  After placing the letterbox in the hole you replace the plug of sod<br/>
to form an almost invisible seam.  This lowers the likelihood of the<br/>
happenchance find.<br/>
<br/>
I plan to adopt the plugging method and I hope others will do this also.  I hope<br/>
we do this because "plugging" will lessen the likelihood of lost boxes due to<br/>
people stumbling upon them.  Then we will have a better chance of knowing if<br/>
the web problem is real or perceived, and if its real we will have a better<br/>
idea of knowing the extent.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I liked the plugging idea, too, but then there would have to be sod,<br/>
wouldn't there?  Mostly we have lots of mud, or dry dusty dirt, along Duck<br/>
Creek.  Maybe it's time to find a new location...<br/>
<br/>
The one box of mine that is still out there is under a pile (small one) of<br/>
rocks--maybe I could use one large rock as the plug...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As interesting as it sounds, I am concerned about the idea of "plugging"<br/>
- I had thought, from what I'd read about Dartmoor Letterboxing, that<br/>
there is an unwritten code that forbids hiding a box anyplace that might<br/>
engourage destructive activity in the search, i.e., don't tear apart any<br/>
rock walls or cairns, dig  any holes, etc. <br/>
<br/>
We have discussed in the past whether or not to seek 'permission' from<br/>
landowners, park services, etc, prior to placing boxes. As I remember,<br/>
it was generally agreed that Letterboxing was a non-destructive sport<br/>
that could in fact, facilitate and encourage an attitude of stewardship<br/>
of the land upon which we hike and within which we hide boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Someone out there, carrying a shovel, looking for a letterbox, and not<br/>
very good at deciphering a clue, might due the sport a great disservice<br/>
in the search as evidenced by a lot of holes left behind.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps LetterGophering is an apt desccription? <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought<br/>
