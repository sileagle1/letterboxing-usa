You may want to send an update to Pete so it's travels can continue to <br/>

P.S. My opion is that only the creator of a HH should decide to list it <br/>
on any particular site.<br/>

Does anyone know Corrina, who released this hitchhiker around 2003? I <br/>
found it, and released it with a new log book. I'd like to mail her the <br/>
origianl one, but she did not reply to my email.<br/>
<br/>
Please let her know. Also, if I do not hear from her, can I enter it <br/>
onto LBNA or Atlas Quest to keep track of it? Or does that violate <br/>
letterboxing ettiquette? (It is obviously not currently listed on <br/>
either website.<br/>
