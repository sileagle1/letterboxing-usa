to make the trip. Thank you Sir B and Jugglermouse for hosting such a fun <br/>
event. Unfortunately we were not able to locate all the boxes in the meadow due to <br/>
our limited time frame, we still had a great time. And the cheeseracing...well <br/>
Turtle Leader won! Wow! He was so excited. The event stamp was definitely a <br/>
work of art and the 4 president's were  equally great. How do we find the other <br/>
president's stamps?<br/>
<br/>
We met wonderful people, old friends and new friends - we even tracked down <br/>
AshRaven. It was a pleasure meeting Ryan, since we had been following his AT <br/>
adventures and we had been hiking vicariously thru him - it truly was the icing <br/>
on the cake.<br/>
<br/>
The prizes were terrific and now we have no excuse not to plant a box. Turtle <br/>
Leader plans to plant one in our area and maybe we'll see plenty of <br/>
letterboxers out our way. We're looking forward to your next event. We're already <br/>
talking about a return trip. <br/>

Snail Lady, Turtle Leader, and Lock Dude<br/>
