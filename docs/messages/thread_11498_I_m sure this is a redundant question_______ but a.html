That would be nice in theory, although I'm not sure how well it would <br/>
work out in practice.  But if you want to create your own <br/>
little "club" for your area--there's certainly nothing wrong with <br/>
doing so!  I know of a few offshoots from this board that were <br/>
created to avoid some of the 'clutter' on this board.  Like the <br/>
hitchhiker board so information about hitchhikers won't clog up this <br/>
board quite as much as it used to.  I've never actually read the <br/>
board--but I know it exists and gets at least some action.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what part of the country you're from, but feel free to <br/>
create your own "Pacific Northwest Letterboxing" board or "New <br/>
England Letterboxing" board or whatever.  If you want to make sure <br/>
new and updated clues are added to the LbNA website, you'll have to <br/>
arrange to make sure one of the webmaster 'patrols' that board or <br/>
else post the clue to this one as well.<br/>
<br/>
For now, most people try to begin their posts with the area of the <br/>
country it's pertinent to (the two-letter abbreviation for the <br/>
applicable state).  It's not really a bad idea, I think, but nobody <br/>
has picked up the wand and ran with it.  So go for it if you want <br/>
to.  =)<br/>

   With most people putting their region or state abbreviation in the subject of the post, its possible that you could create a filter in your email program that would move the posts that interest you into a certain folder.<br/>
   For my own part, as there is very few letterboxes in my area, I am enjoying reading about all the other parts of the country that I hope to visit sometime. <br/>
