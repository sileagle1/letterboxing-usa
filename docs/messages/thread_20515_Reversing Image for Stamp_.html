<br/>
I'm new to this list...and the hobby. I'm working on my signature <br/>
stamp before going out hunting, but I've run into a snag. I'm hoping <br/>
someone here can help jog my memory. I was trying to be tricky and <br/>
plan ahead, but instead I think I outsmarted myself. =)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my problem is that I have letters on my stamp.... Now, I <br/>
knew they needed to be inverted before being rubbed onto the carving <br/>
medium, so I went ahead and drew them mirror-image. So, I got <br/>
everything ready, scanned the image into my computer, got <br/>
it "cleaned up," and planned to use the xylene-pen transfer method. <br/>
Oooops! I guess I didn't need to invert the letters to do it that <br/>
way. So, now I'm looking at an image that needs to be turned around <br/>
backwards (in addition to the letters being correct, I would like my <br/>
signature to be "looking" the opposite direction.)<br/>
<br/>
I thought there was an option in a program like Adobe Photoshop to <br/>
reverse an image. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I tried <br/>
invert, but all that does is make a negative of my image. What I <br/>
want to do is flip it as if you were looking at the correct side of <br/>
a film negative, then turned it over and looked at the other side. <br/>
All of the objects would be on the opposite side. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this makes sense to someone (it IS nearly 2 in the morning <br/>
here =) and that there is an option to do this. I don't want to have <br/>
to go back to Kinko's to use the scanner. It is no fun with my 15 <br/>
month old in tow. Plus, I want to get this carved and go find my <br/>
first stash! =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>

Now I just have to finish backfilling some sprinkler trenches, plant <br/>
my new landscape plants before they die in the pots, make dinner, <br/>
and find some quiet time after the baby is in bed to get started! =)<br/>
~ Oh, and manage not to stay up too late in the process. Did that <br/>
last night. Bad for mommy.<br/>
<br/>
So thanks to everyone for your very speedy responses! Jayme, I <br/>
hadn't thought of using my photo printer options, but I see that is <br/>
a possibility. I will have to remember that. And DebBee, THANKS for <br/>
the "flip horizontal" reminder. That is exactly what I was looking <br/>
for. I can't believe it was literally the next command on the menu <br/>
from "invert" and I didn't see it! CapeCod, thanks for your response <br/>
too. That is definitely how I will do things in the future. The <br/>
problem is, this time I got my image drawn and scanned, and THEN <br/>
decided my signature was "looking" the wrong way. I just changed my <br/>
mind. Not a problem if I had a scanner here, but I don't. <br/>
Hmmm...maybe for Christmas. Except I was planning on getting a GPS. <br/>
But if I'm letterboxing, how will I ever have time for  <br/>
geocaching? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And since you're all so brilliant, I'm sure you know about this <br/>
already, but I thought I'd pass on a tip that works in Adobe <br/>
Photoshop that might help with carving. If you go in under Filter-<br/>
Stylize-Emboss it makes a great picture of what your carved stamp <br/>
will look like. I'm not sure it would make a good transfer image (I <br/>
will try) but it is good to see what things will look like and if <br/>
there are any glaring mistakes. Also, Filter-Sketch-Stamp seemed to <br/>
smooth the edges around my hand-drawn image nicely.<br/>
<br/>
OK, done for now. I'll try not to make all of my messages so long in <br/>
the future.<br/>
<br/>
A Very Grateful Grifos<br/>
