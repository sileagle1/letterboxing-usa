Dearest Uncle Richard,<br/>
<br/>
The events in my previous missive transpir'd almost a fortnight ago.  I hied <br/>
up Pequot Path to the Market in Kings Towne and had almost reached the site <br/>
of Roger William's trading post in Cocumcussuc.  Not only was it the day <br/>
before the Sabbath but five days hence was the annual Celebration with the <br/>
heathen, Canonicus and his tribe.  I would have missed Uncle Thomas and the <br/>
furtive ilk had my horse, Patience, not requir'd refreshment.<br/>

<br/>
In your recent letter you enquir'd about the Nature of the strange acts of <br/>
Uncle Thomas.  Though the Sun was full up; it was not yet nigh on noon.  A <br/>
full two hours to midday Victuals.  I stopped for Respite and to slake my <br/>
horse's thirst at the Cold Spring near where the town elders erected the <br/>
building for the Villagers to recreate.  There in the clearing in front of <br/>
the structure I saw Uncle Tom skulking about with Strangers, acting in a <br/>
manner most mysterious.<br/>
<br/>
These questionable characters carried India ink, letter seals and Journals.  <br/>
I ventur'd inside the building and beheld a table groaning with Dishes that <br/>
appeared most Savoury.  Even though it was not yet time for Food I became <br/>
quite peckish.  Several of the rank kind were bearing Pelts and woolen <br/>
Coats, as well as new Muffs and warm Bandeaus to leave for the Penurious.<br/>
<br/>
It was most Unusual but I fear this is all I can relate for now.  Please <br/>
contact me, dearest Uncle, if you need more Enlightenment.<br/>
<br/>
Your obedient niece,<br/>
Tabitha Noone<br/>

Fellow Travellers,<br/>
<br/>
The Days draw Short and Chilled.  It appears that Winter is soon upon us.  I <br/>
beg your kind Consideration in the upcoming Event.  Several fellow Colonists <br/>
are unprepared for the Cold and need warm Pelts and Outergarments to survive <br/>
the upcoming Winter.  I will make Containers available.<br/>
