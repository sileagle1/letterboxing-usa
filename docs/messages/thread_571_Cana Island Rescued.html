replanted.<br/>
<br/>
Following Deborah's suggestion, I went out armed with<br/>
a long stick and a wad of chewing gum.  Alas, the gum<br/>
was not strong enough to pull the letterbox free, but<br/>
the stick did help me prop the box up to a position<br/>
where I could grab it finally.  (Nearly wedging myself<br/>
irretrievably into the tree the box was hidden in.  A<br/>
potentially embarrassing situation as I was there by<br/>
myself and no other people were even on the island!) <br/>
However, the tree consented to let me and the<br/>
letterbox go after a small struggle and a minor scrape<br/>
on the arm.<br/>
<br/>
The contents of the box are in excellent condition<br/>
after a winter, spring, and now summer in a terribly<br/>
damp and often stormy location.  (Yay for tupperware<br/>
and ziplocs!)  It was also, unfortunately, unvisited<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
The clue for the new location should now read: "From<br/>
the nautical parking brake, look toward the setting<br/>
sun.  Now subtract from that compass bearing the<br/>
number of cards you play solitaire with.  Follow the<br/>
new heading to the letterbox."<br/>

I guess you can always bring a laptop and a cell-phone modem, and post a<br/>
clue as to where you are stuck.......<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget to carry a stamp, in case your rescuer wants to stamp their<br/>
own book <grin><br/>
Anyhow, glad the box was intact and safe!<br/>
