the Main Talklist.<br/>
<br/>
The first original Letterbox Difficulty Rating System is now up and running<br/>
at The National Letterbox Consortium Website. I invite everyone to take a<br/>
look at it and let me know what you think and what else you'd like to see on<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
In a brief synopsis, it uses a code, much like the PFX count. I call it the<br/>
LbRS count and it looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
M1 T2 L3 A4 C5 D1 H0 S1<br/>
<br/>
It's very easy, once you get the hang of it.<br/>
<br/>
"M" stands for "Modifier" in other word's, how that person (The one that<br/>
entered the LB Rating) rates themselves as a hiker in a 1 to 5 scale, 1<br/>
being the worst, 5 being the best.<br/>
"T" stands for the Terrain in a 1 to 5 scale, 1 being the easiest, 5 being<br/>
the hardest.<br/>
"L" stands for the Location in a 1 to 5 scale, 1 being the easiest, 5 being<br/>
the hardest.<br/>
"A"stands for the Accessibility in a 1 to 5 scale, 1 being the easiest, 5<br/>
being the hardest.<br/>
"C" stands for the Clues in a 1 to 5 scale, 1 being the easiest, 5 being the<br/>
hardest.<br/>
"D" stands for Dog friendly with a 1 meaning yes and a 0 meaning no.<br/>
"H" stands for Handicap friendly with a 1 meaning yes and a 0 meaning no.<br/>
"S" stands for Stroller friendly with a 1 meaning yes and a 0 meaning no.<br/>
<br/>
It resides at http://www.myndworx.com/modules/lcas/diff_gen.php and is mean<br/>
to run from inside the NLC Database system, however, if you wish, you can<br/>
use the form to generate the code for your letterboxes and use it elsewhere.<br/>
I think this will make it easier for all concerned if this format is used as<br/>
it resembles the current format for PFX counts and it is easily<br/>
understandable.  It doesn't leave much to the imagination and the Modifier<br/>
tells you that the hike that person rated as easy, may be a bit more than<br/>
easy for you if you are a novice.  It doesn't give anything away about the<br/>
letterbox, it just helps you make an informed decision about whether or not<br/>
you want to try for that letterbox.<br/>
