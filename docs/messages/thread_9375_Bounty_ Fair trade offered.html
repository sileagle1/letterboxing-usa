Whereas, a certain friend of mine, a letterboxing recluse to be<br/>
sure, is in dire need to deliver a certain payload to a certain<br/>
place, has charged me with obtaining the services of <br/>
"Flutterby", an object I know by name but otherwise know <br/>
very little of.<br/>
<br/>
Whereas, it is well known that such objects are in high demand,<br/>
he has authorized me to offer a bounty for the delivery of<br/>
said object: choice of either a WoM clue that very few have <br/>
seen, or the key to a certain unsolved mystery on a certain <br/>
"Wachusett Mountain", a place I've never seen but have heard <br/>
wonderous things about.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, he has authorized me to offer _both_ bounties should<br/>
said object be delivered by December 7th, as there is great<br/>
urgency in this matter.  He has further requested that all <br/>
further communications in this matter be taken off-list, and <br/>
that all such communications be made through me.<br/>
