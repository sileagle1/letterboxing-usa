                    <div class="plaintext-content">Start at the intersection of Belle Terre Parkway and RT 100.<br/>
Turn in the direction of the Atlantic Ocean and the rising morning <br/>
sun.<br/>
Travel 4.1 miles on RT 100(East) passing the base of the high flying <br/>
machines on your right and further along, the pink home of the angels <br/>
of mercy on your left. <br/>
At Colbert Lane, turn left and proceed 3.1 miles.You will know you <br/>
are headed in the correct direction when you pass the two giant <br/>
concrete sentinels on your right and Graham Swamp further on your <br/>
left. After passing the new Palm Coast Plantation turn right at the <br/>
unmarked street, but identified by the Herschel King Park sign <br/>
opposite the turn. Venture on to the park entraance, enjoying the <br/>
huge water fountains on on your right.<br/>
Park anywhere in the lot to the left. Follow the sidewalk to the <br/>
immediate right of the boat launch for the intercoastal waterway. <br/>
Stay on the walk past the pavilion and restrooms to where a crushed <br/>
seashell path turns off to the right. Take that path, veering to the <br/>
left, continue until you see a paved road to your left. Look to your <br/>
right, you will see an extremely large tree with a short stumpy palm <br/>
tree right next to it. The box lies behind the trunks; it is covered <br/>
by two long stemmed palm branches. To play it safe, in case  <br/>
something  has decided to keep the box  company, carefully pick up <br/>
the branches by the  stem end. While you are in the park you may want <br/>
to ennjoy 1.) the walk out to the edge of the intercoastal waterway <br/>
and  2.) the trail at the far end of the parking lot where you parked <br/>
your car.  <br/>
