just recieved an e-mail from two young ladies who found a journal full <br/>

Aug. '04 about a stamper's journal I found with my e-mail, so the <br/>
ladies contacted me about the journal they found. I highly suspect that <br/>
they have found the letterbox journal for Rusted Butterfly in the Goose <br/>
Creek series, but I haven't yet been able to ascertain if they found <br/>
the rest of the box or not.<br/>
   Are the box's placers still active? Is there a Lost Box Journal <br/>
procedure? I'm going to try to recover the journal, and I'm really glad <br/>
my contact info was in it and the journal didn't simply vanish!<br/>

I know there is 2 in that series, and I know that one has been missing for some time.  I think "Rusted Butterfly" is the one that WAS left alive...I have taken over a series for the planter of that series in another park, and she is kinda retired from letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
  Let me know if I can help....I mailed her old books back to her before...or I can go check on the box this weekend<br/>
