We found all in good condition:<br/>
Skull and Bones,The Inventor, Orion, &amp; Independence.<br/>
As well as Mr Jefferson and Cherry Blossom (still a bit damp, but we <br/>
put everything back, double bagged)<br/>
By the time we headed home again one to VA the other to MD, a cup of <br/>
hot chocolate and shelter from the wind was a warm welcome. <br/>

It was the Space Travelers, Mike &amp; Judi from PA. We followed the Virginia<br/>
Waterbird all day. We can also report that the Ram, Mr Taft and the Egypt<br/>
Explorer were AOK. It was so nice to be outside without a heavy coat! I<br/>
loved the micro boxes - I felt like such a spy :)<br/>
