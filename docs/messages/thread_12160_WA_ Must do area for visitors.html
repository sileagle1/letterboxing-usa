wonderful collection of boxes in the Olympia ( Thurston County) area.<br/>
<br/>
Today I visited McLean Creek yet again for Trial and Errors three new <br/>
boxes ( as well as a bonus box)  What a wonderful venue.  Swamp and <br/>
marsh deep woods and running creek.  You will see some of the largest <br/>
tree stumps ever to nurse new growth.  In the Fall the salmon run.  I <br/>
guess 15 miutes from the state capitol.  <br/>
<br/>
Also further west is Kennedy Creek, to the north is Tolmie State park <br/>
and all around in Tumwater, Lacey and points west of the intersection <br/>
of I-5 and Hwy 101 are plenty of multibox venues.<br/>
<br/>
It was such a perfect day that I have to encourage you to not <br/>
overlook our state capitol as a hot bed of boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Hoopoe feels mighty happy to have done all three of Trial and Errors <br/>
boxes without a hitch.  Things like that just don't happen to me.<br/>
