                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh DebBee, you brought back memories with that one.  I was just getting over a 3-week flu, still weak as a kitten when I tackled that one.  Parked way before the road split and flagpole and walked (meadered would be a more apt term), pausing to speak to the many mini-dachshund owners.  The lack of physical health prompted me to stop three or four times - but the photos are pretty from that beautiful October day, multi colored leaves strewn at random.  At the top of the steps, I looked back to where the Durango was parked and reached in my pocket to discover the clues not there.  A moment of epiphany, remembering putting the printout on the passenger seat.  So I tried anyway, stepping over a scantily-clad college aged couple engaged in intimacy, but resulted in no find.  A very funny day.  I did find the Mystery box that trip though, so that was a plus too.<br/>

There used to be one, Steeplechase, in Nashville, that had a bunch of stairs <br/>
to climb!<br/>
