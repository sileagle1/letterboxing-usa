                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there!  I made it to F100 on October 23rd.  My 100th stamp was the <br/>
Octopus placed by Funhog out here in the Pacific Northwest.  It was a <br/>
very rainy weekend for letterboxing, but I was so close to the 100 <br/>
goal, that I did not let a little bad weather deter me.<br/>
<br/>
I also picked up Horsetail Falls, Who Let the Dogs Out, PCC Sylvania <br/>
#1, Rock Creek Dragon, Bronson Creek, Cedar Hills Twins #2 (Thanks <br/>
Ryan for the inspiration), the Tryon Creek Orphan, and Beaver Creek <br/>
Letterbox #1.<br/>
<br/>
Funhog---I hunted for, but did not find the Oak Bottoms and the <br/>
Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden boxes.  Which I thought was odd, <br/>
since they were just placed! I'll try to contact you off the list, to <br/>
discuss the clues, maybe I am just dense.  I also wimped out on the <br/>
PCC Sylvania boxes #2 and #3.  It was just too rainy to balance the <br/>
compass and the umbrella for so many paces!!  I also came up empty <br/>
handed at the Rock Creek Troll and the Blue Lake letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Whew!  It was a busy 3 days in Portland!! But thanks to everyone down <br/>
there for placing such terrific stamp images.<br/>
