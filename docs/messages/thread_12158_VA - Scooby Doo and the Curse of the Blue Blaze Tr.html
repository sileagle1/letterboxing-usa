                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was all starting to seem familiar...  Team BeMa tired, trudging, lost <br/>
somewhere in the woods on a blue blaze trail...looking....looking for some <br/>
type of road - except this time it was an abandoned one to the left instead <br/>
of the Vestal Trail at Claude Moore.<br/>
<br/>
Yes -- Froggy -- this time Shaggy -- strikes again and the curse is back!<br/>
<br/>
I don't know why it always happens to us.  Perhaps we are so busy looking <br/>
down at all the roots in the path, holding tight on to Miss Ma so she <br/>
doesn't go &gt;splat&lt; like she normally does.  In any event -- we somehow <br/>
missed the abandoned road and kept walking and walking WAY the Heck out of <br/>
our way.<br/>
<br/>
So, here is our hint -- if you're looking for Shaggy and you pass the mile <br/>
marker -- turn around -- you've gone too far!  If you somehow continue on <br/>
and you find a path with power lines -- turn around -- you've gone too far!  <br/>
If you somehow continue and you go under and over any trees blocking the <br/>
path -- you've gone too far -- turn around and go back!  If you somehow keep <br/>
going and you come to lots and lots of mud and the path gets really skinny <br/>
-- turn around -- come to a river (with a really cool box turtle with an <br/>
orange head)... well, you get the picture!<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad we finally decided that the blue blaze path wasn't a circuit and <br/>
headed back.  A long time later, back at the map board we neglected to check <br/>
out before we confidently hit the trail, we discovered it was a 17.5 mile <br/>
trail heading in one direction!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have to say, the kids were great, only moaning a couple of times and Da <br/>
with his pulled groin muscle kept a smile on his face...<br/>
<br/>
The smile on my face appeared somewhere after the lake when I realized that <br/>
the man I yelled to who was bushwhacking off the path behind a tree was <br/>
probably not a boxer and possible exchange that I had hoped, but some poor <br/>
guy relieving himself in nature....  Whooops!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway -- We had a great time with the rest of the Scooby gang!  The kids <br/>
loved guessing which member we would rescue next.  Scooby gave us a bit of a <br/>
hunt (the clue at the bottom of the page really helped).  Everyone else was <br/>
right where they were supposed to be.  Our theory is that Shaggy got jealous <br/>
of the mini oreos we ate while stamping into Fred and ran out of his hiding <br/>
place somehow obscuring a whole road in the process!...<br/>
<br/>
Fountain Head Park -- we will return and solve your final mystery!  We think <br/>
we know where the road is now and we still have two other non-Scooby boxes <br/>
to find there!  But for now, I think we'll just take a little nap - we're <br/>
pooped!  BeMa<br/>
