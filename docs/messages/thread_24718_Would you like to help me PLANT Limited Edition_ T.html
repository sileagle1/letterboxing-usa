Perhaps the best thing to do would be to create a seperate yahoo chatlist for those who are interested and then direct them there for further discussion. I sure would love to see this thread go away... ambercodered <ambercodered@yahoo.com> wrote: Wow, what a sewing circle this has become!!!I had no idea there were so many nagging old ladies here. As mentioned previously, I'll contact everyone who is interested .... and anyone else who is interested in the future can continue to contact me. Fact is, this is going to happen anyway so .... if anyone is confused about anything, I'm the person to ask, so feel free to e-mail me directly. Otherwise if any more old ladies keep nodding their heads back and forth, they just might unscrew and I'm afraid a bunh of heads might just fall off and roll away, right under the table and out the door or someplace ..... and I wouldn't want to think I was responsible for that.
