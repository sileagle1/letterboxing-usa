<br/>
If a "letterbox that finds you" gets damaged in the mail, does it qualify for the ubiquitous Letterboxing Purple Heart? <br/>

Meanwhile, I keep coming back to the idea of a letterbox that arrives in your letterbox!  hehe!  That is ... a letterbox that finds you by mail.<br/>
It's a tricky idea, and Im not sure how to pull it off yet - but I'm thinking (and open to hear your thoughts and suggestions) about sending a<br/>
&gt; log book and stamp to someone (CodyBCleo has volunteered on my short list of folks so far).  Then you'd stamp in as you would with any other <br/>
box, and then mail it along to someone else.<br/>
The trick is keeping the box moving, being willing to pay the postage for the item to move along, and including addresses of willing letterboxers who<br/>
want the box.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Thoughts and suggestions?<br/>

something as stupid, in the future, to warrant it. <br/>
   I kind of like the idea that it stays in the same mailing box. Not <br/>
only do you stamp into the letterbox you put your stamp on the <br/>
outside mailing box. That would look so cool!<br/>

It would be like reviving the old time travel stickers on travel trunks <br/>

Please add my name to the list of people interested in getting the letterbox by mail. <br/>
<br/>
If we just list people's names (and maybe email's) on a webpage, people that get the box, can then use the list to contact someone else to send the box to. It could even be used for more than one 'by mail' letterbox if more people want to create them. <br/>
