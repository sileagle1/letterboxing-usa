 But, could you please turn off your caps lock? In internet speak,<br/>
 right now you are screaming at all of us for no reason. I'm usually<br/>
 pretty live-and-let-live in terms of emails and posts and whatnot --<br/>
 typos and chatspeak and all doesn't really bother me. But, it would be<br/>
 easier to read without all the capitalization, and I do want to read<br/>
 what you have to tell us! Thanks!<br/>

 &gt;  "JOHN PENNEKAMP STATE PARK"<br/>
