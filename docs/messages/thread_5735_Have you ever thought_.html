                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Eagleboxer,<br/>
<br/>
I too am an Eagle Scout.  <br/>
<br/>
Lets look at this issue from a scouting perspective.  What skills <br/>
would a scout be gaining by earning this badge that he can't already <br/>
get with existing badges.  <br/>
<br/>
There's already orienteering and several art related badges.  Many of <br/>
the skills I've learned in Scouting I've applied to letterboxing as <br/>
well as (and more importantly) to life.  <br/>
<br/>
There was a discussion going on a while back by several scout leaders <br/>
regarding doing letterboxing as a troop activity.  One of the big <br/>
sticking points was the Scout rule of leaving and area better than <br/>
you found it.  Some consider leaving a letterbox as going against <br/>
that rule.  I personally don't agree with that.  A letter box is not <br/>
a piece of refuse.  Just like a trail shelter or a picnic table, it's <br/>
something that is in use.<br/>
<br/>
As long as it is well hidden and in a non-sensitive area it should <br/>
not create a problem.  I believe that letterboxing in North America <br/>
is going to be coming to a crossroads soon.  Public land managers <br/>
have a responsibility to knowing what's on their land and how it's <br/>
being used.  That's for both the protection of the area as well as <br/>
the users of that area.  If there's a lost hiker, he's got to know <br/>
all the places that that hiker might be, which includes letterbox <br/>
locations.  <br/>
<br/>
Up to this time it's been a rather casual sport.  The only way that I <br/>
believe letterboxing can exist on public land openly is for there to <br/>
be a non-profit organization representing the sport.  Otherwise it <br/>
would have to be clandestine.<br/>
<br/>
So, in conclusion, the jury's not in on whether letterboxing can be <br/>
considered a legitimate past-time in this country.  If in the end, it <br/>
can't be done openly, I would vote "NO" for its appropriateness as a <br/>
merit badge subject.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>
<br/>

In that light, we should all be somewhat careful how/where/when we <br/>
choose to promote this pasttime. An occasional magazine article, <br/>
lacking specifics, isn't likely to make a bunch of park rangers hunt <br/>
us down. But the right word in the wrong company could have us losing <br/>
more boxes and boxing places than we have so far.<br/>

<br/>
Just thought that I'd chime in as an Asst. Scoutmaster.  At first <br/>
thought it seems like a fun idea but I'd have to agree with one of <br/>
the other 'boxers that stated you have to look at what the other <br/>
merit badges accomplish.  They are in large part designed to <br/>
introduce a boy to an activity or profession that he may want to <br/>
pursue in greater detail at his own pace after earning that badge.  <br/>
They also give the scout skills to be applied to his scouting <br/>
experience as well as life in general.  Again, something that several <br/>
other badges accomplish that lead to letterboxing.  Essentially, <br/>
would something new be learned that would assist the scout in the BSA <br/>
or his life with the creation of a letterboxing merit badge?<br/>
<br/>
To the question of wether or not a scout can wear a non BSA merit <br/>
badge on his sash.  According to what I've read, no.  But that <br/>
doesn't mean that an enterprising young scout can't find a way to <br/>
display it while in uniform.  I've seen some VERY interesting <br/>
neckerchief slides.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.<br/>

I think you miss my point.  I would like to see it as an open <br/>
activity that has the approval of public land managers.  The issue <br/>
isn't just about losing boxes or getting in trouble.  It's about <br/>
understanding the responsibilities of land managers and seeing their <br/>
side of the story.  They're understaffed as it is and they can't be <br/>
worried about maintaining things such as letterboxes on their land.  <br/>
I'm telling you that the answer lies in having some kind of entity to <br/>
deal with.  As I've said before in this group, nobody can just walk <br/>
onto public land and build a trail shelter.  However, Mountain and <br/>
trail clubs build them and maintain them since there is a group that <br/>
the land managers can contact.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that can't happen with letterboxing.  I don't know. I know, as  <br/>
a result of our last intense discussion on the topic a year ago many <br/>
people began listing the terrain difficulty and off road time <br/>
required.  I appreciate that and would go further to say that the <br/>
clues should encourage the searcher to use the same precautions that <br/>
any outdoors enthusiest (or scout) would use.  Not just "take <br/>
precautions" but, rather, be specific regardless of how simple it <br/>
seems!  If they don't follow them, that's their problem.  When the <br/>
box involves a long hike, they should be advised to check with the <br/>
ranger to tell him where they're going, even if they don't mention <br/>
letterboxing.  In all my years of hiking I've seldom followed the <br/>
rule I learned in Scouting of telling somebody where I was going.  <br/>
However, nobody else was sending me out there but myself. No need to <br/>
open up last year's can of worms.  Just think of this as another <br/>
suggestion and I'll end it there.  <br/>
<br/>
My other suggestion, is to keep unacknowledged boxes on public lands <br/>
as drive-bys and short walks.    <br/>
<br/>
I just believe that somebody needs to approach public land management <br/>
agencies at a higher level than the local ranger station.  If we go <br/>
individually to our local rangers, some of us will have success and <br/>
some won't.  However, if the ruling comes down from above it won't <br/>
matter what the local guy thinks.  It will be out of his hands.  <br/>
<br/>
There could be a lot of advantages for public land if letterboxing <br/>
were done on it.  There already is.  Many of you have done a <br/>
wonderful job of placing natural and historic interpretive <br/>
information in your clues.  They need people using their lands in <br/>
order to get more funds for improvements and land acquisition.  If <br/>
this could be presented in the right way, it could blossom into a <br/>
wonderful symbiotic relationship.  <br/>
<br/>
I would prefer to do letterboxing openly, because I sympathize with <br/>
the plight of the public land manager.  Unfortunately, I don't have <br/>
the time or the resources at this time to be the organizer of a <br/>
letterboxing organization.  I wish I could.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure there are some public land managers lurking.  They're the <br/>
ones I'd really like to hear from.  There needs to be a dialog.  <br/>
Maybe, in a later message I can list a number of guidelines that I <br/>
would suggest if I were a public land manager.  We've got to get a <br/>
discussion going.  <br/>
<br/>
Here's an analogy.  Some underage teenagers go into the woods all the <br/>
time to drink.  They think it's such a great thing and that they're <br/>
so free when they're out there.  They'd laugh at any of their peers <br/>
who might suggest that they're doing something wrong and could get in <br/>
trouble. Yet, when they get caught by a ranger they're so surprised <br/>
and indignant.  In my previous discussions, some of the attitudes <br/>
displayed reminded me of those 'pre-caught' teens.  <br/>
<br/>
You say you want letterboxing to be free.  I would like it to exist.  <br/>
The only people who should be solving mysteries are the searchers, <br/>
not the people charged with managing the land they're hidden on.<br/>

also, I agree with the idea of a non profit<br/>
organization for letterboxing as well, but then you<br/>
have the issue that it would have to be seperate<br/>
organizations for each region because letterboxing is<br/>
spread over great distances. Since we would be<br/>
needing several organizations we would have to find<br/>
people to run them and people to work for it, that<br/>
would be very difficult. I would say that a non<br/>
profit organization is a little beyond us right now<br/>
but we should keep it in mind for a later date when<br/>
letterboxing is more 'public'.<br/>

<br/>
I don't know of anyone involved from the Boy Scouts side but there <br/>
are several people in CT and RI involved with the Girl Scouts.  There <br/>
have been organized lessons on stamp carving and letterboxing with <br/>
letterboxes being placed on Girl Scout property (with proper <br/>
permissions.)<br/>
