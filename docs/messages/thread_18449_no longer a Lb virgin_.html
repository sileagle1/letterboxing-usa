                    <div class="plaintext-content">Use your artistic skills, by all means.  That will leave most of us <br/>
jealous.  There are many of us that are good carvers, but not <br/>
many of us can creatively design our own stamps well.  When I <br/>
was beginning to carve I found that my best stamps started with <br/>
bolder, more solid patterns.  They could still be artistic, but they <br/>
were simpler to carve.  Now I can carve much more intricate <br/>
designs.  <br/>
<br/>
The other nice aspect is that if you don't like your stamp after a <br/>
while, you can carve a new one.  My first sig stamp was the first <br/>
stamp I ever carved.  I love it because of my history with it, but I <br/>
did end up changing it by the end of the year when my carving <br/>
was much better.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
