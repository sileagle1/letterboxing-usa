Hi everyone!  Despite the yucky snowy/slushy weather here, we decided that we just had to go letterboxing!  The children have been pestering me all week to go find another box (even without dad!)...so we happily obliged them by seeking Bridges of Lancaster and the Buggy boxes, which were great because they mostly involved driving and that we could do in the slush!  Dh couldn't find the Briges box initially and had to get my son and daughter (both 7) to help him find it (I was stuck in the car with the babies - sigh!).  Finally found it, everything was in great shape and the stamp was absolutely beautiful!  But still the children were not satisfied....wanted to find another box.  Luckily I had a binder full of PA letterbox clues (I am a little obsessive about organization) with us - all divided by county, of course - and there was another that really involved just driving and a really short walk.  It was not really raining or anything when we got there, just a little spit of snow here and again, so dh got out once again to have the satisfaction of finding the box (it keeps him interested!) and another great stamp was added to our log book....now we have a whole three found!  (don't laugh too much).  Hubby said that there was a lot of runoff from the road washing around the box and it was muddy (we cleaned it up) but contents were safe and dry.  Well, even though the children were begging for more (I can't believe that they are so interested), we had to call it a day, but promised that we would try again maybe next weekend and maybe venturing up into another close by county.  So thanks for two great boxes - they saved us from being stuck indoors on such a dreary day and kept the kids in good spirits (for at least most of the trip)!<br/>

Glad to hear the Bridges of Lancaster box is alive and well, and that <br/>
your family had such a wonderful outing finding it!  Thanks for the <br/>
report.<br/>

       Glad you found my Buggy Box I won't get to check on it for <br/>
months yet as we live in Ct. but visit Pa. once or twice a year. <br/>
Being farmers  we love to come to God's green acre!  Be sure that I <br/>
will place another the next time I'm there. We are thinking of going <br/>
to the Doylestown gather enroute to  Bird in Hand in June. Maybe we <br/>
will meet and get an exchange . I will have Cowboy my 9 year old with <br/>
me. Happy boxing glad the kids liked it. Leader of the Pack - carol<br/>
