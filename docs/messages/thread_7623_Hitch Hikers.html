It's an awesome idea for a HH.  I'm sure it will see plenty of action <br/>

Hey, I have a question for all of you vets out there.  I am getting <br/>
ready to send out a couple of hitch hikers into the real world and <br/>
was wondering if anyone has a set script that they put with hitch <br/>
hikers to explain them to the finders and what to do.  I can <br/>
certainly make something up on my own but want to make sure that I <br/>
don't forget something.  Who knows....maybe they will be planted in <br/>
a box near you???!<br/>

Silent Doug has a great article on Hitchhiker Etiquette:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/articles/00000011.php<br/>
<br/>
The section on "Logging a Hitchhiker" would be perfect for a HH <br/>
explanation script.<br/>
