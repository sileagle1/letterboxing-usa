<br/>
Here's a quick update:<br/>
(we have posted this message on the geocaching.com list and sent it to<br/>
those that have signed up to our event.  Our apologies if you receive<br/>
this twice.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have obtained interim prizes!<br/>
--------------------------------<br/>
There are now daily prizes for the top three scores for each day. A<br/>
player can choose to "Accept" the daily prize and lose all points gained<br/>
that day, or "Pass" on the prize, retaining their points. If the prize<br/>
is "passed" on, it roll over to the 2 and 3 place prize for the final<br/>
day, thus, increasing their sizes.<br/>
Day 1: $75 (1st), $50 (2nd), $25 (3rd) to the top three players.<br/>
Day 2: $100 (1st), $75 (2nd), $50 (3rd) to the top three players.<br/>
Day 3: $125 (1st), $100 (2nd), $75 (3rd) to the top three players.<br/>
Day 4: $5000 to top player, $200 to second place, $150 to third place.<br/>
(Remember, if previous daily prizes are not used during the first three<br/>
days, they roll over and are added to the 2nd and 3rd place prize on<br/>
this day)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Discount to participants that order their tickets via the web:<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
If you order your ticket via the web, you can use this code "geobuck" in<br/>
the Foxhall Bucks area of the online store to receive $5.00 off your<br/>
purchase of $20.00 or more.  Please visit the ticket page and make your<br/>
purchase today: https://www2.strickland.com/fh_store/<br/>
<br/>
The 4-day Pass is the ticket that will cover the basics of getting into<br/>
the event for all days.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Setting the Caches.<br/>
------------------<br/>
We've received a few questions on what we plan to use when we hide the<br/>
caches.  We are using 3 Garmin Etrex Vista's and will get three readings<br/>
from each (9 readings total) of each cache.  We will provide the average<br/>
coordinates based on our readings.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Camping?<br/>
--------<br/>
Just out of curiosity... can everyone that would be interested in<br/>
camping out, particularly out-of-towners, let me know.  I know that<br/>
traveling and finding a room gets a little expensive and I might be able<br/>
to get the Boy Scouts, who have some property nearby, let us camp out<br/>
there. (Unfortunately, the nearest park that I know of is quite a<br/>
distance away)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Loopholes?<br/>
----------<br/>
An excellent question has recently come up about what happens if two<br/>
guys sign up and are secretly on teams.  The problem is if someone goes<br/>
to a cache and grabs two envelopes, and gives one to his buddy, and when<br/>
his buddy is assigned that cache, he just turns in the envelope without<br/>
having to find it.<br/>
<br/>
We can ensure that the 'buddy' has to at least find the cache.  Along<br/>
with the coordinates to the cache, you will be given a randomly<br/>
generated code.  You must write this unique code in the logbook for your<br/>
points to be confirmed.<br/>
<br/>
We also know which participants are going after which caches. <br/>
Occasionally, we will "turn off a cache" and go and check it ourselves. <br/>
We know the number of envelopes in each cache and the number of people<br/>
that have visited.  If we start getting unbalanced figures, we can<br/>
narrow it down to whom the culprit may be.  The same is true for it's<br/>
location, if someone decides to "move" the cache.<br/>
<br/>
We will perform cache checks often through the day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Junior Tickets:<br/>
---------------<br/>
The age range for Junior Tickets is: 7 to 16<br/>
Children 6 and under can enter free of charge.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please reply directly to me if you have any questions... as the event<br/>
nears, I do not have time to read the geocaching list as much as I'd<br/>
like to.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
