I'd look into it if I were you. <br/>
The NPS gendarmes are watching this list.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This may be a dumb question but does a National Historic Park fall in that category. <br/>
<br/>
I would think so, but that's just me.<br/>
Also - are you thinking of the national register of historic places? That's somewhat <br/>
different also. For example - it might be a private house that is designated under this <br/>
category- but no public access - or it could also be a public park with that designation.<br/>

<br/>
Here in TN, we have several "National Battlefields" and "National Battlefield Cemetaries" which reside on historical sites of Civil War fame. I've often wondered if they're out of bounds for letterboxing.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My guess is that if it falls within the National Park Service's properties, it works like a <br/>
national park. (Like I said, that's a guess, but it would make sense.)<br/>
<br/>
You can find out what sites are theirs here:<br/>
http://www.nps.gov/parks.html<br/>
<br/>
If in doubt, I would contact the specific park and ask.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
