                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey all!  I finally have the dates of my trip to CA.  Unfortunately, <br/>
I'll really only have one day - maybe two for meeting to exchange or <br/>
box.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm flying into Santa Ana on 9/4 and will have that whole day (I <br/>
think its a Thursday) available to box, meet for an exchange, <br/>
whatever!  I might be able to sneak away from work on friday the 5th <br/>
as well, but that would be much harder to schedule.  <br/>
<br/>
I'd love to hunt for some of the boxes in the greater Los Angeles <br/>
area, if anyone is interested in spending a day with a Colorado girl! <br/>
<br/>
Email me off-list!  :)<br/>
Best,<br/>
Autumn<br/>
