Planted by Rubaduc on 9-10-02<br/>
<br/>
This box was planted for all the little people among us, to honor my<br/>
littlest letterboxing  grandson, Timothy (age 3). The stamp was carved by<br/>
his talented Uncle Robb.<br/>
<br/>
You can find Timothy Grass in Norton Park in Plainville, Ct. located on<br/>
South Washington St. just south of the jct. of  Rt. 372 and 177.<br/>
<br/>
After exploring the park where the Farmington Canal was once an active<br/>
part of Plainville life, and after playing on the playground, head west<br/>
towards the last of the picnic areas. You'll come to a brown cement<br/>
building with restrooms and drinking fountain. Going diagonally from the<br/>
building towards the woods, you will find a pretty well traveled path and<br/>
not far down this path is a path to the right with a fallen tree across<br/>
it. Going along the log to the right end will bring you to the end of<br/>
your hunt. <br/>
<br/>
Be careful of poison ivy and be cautious about being seen stamping in.<br/>
This is an active park.<br/>
