                    <div class="plaintext-content">As with many discussions on this list, I believe this discussion has gone WAY <br/>
out of hand.  I believe that the first person who sent the post did not do it <br/>
in a tactful manner.  That person should have notified the moderators <br/>
directly.  I sure they would have immediately taken the offensive material off the <br/>
site.<br/>
<br/>
The moderators can not and do not sit all day monitoring this list.  They <br/>
have lives, just like you and me.  They can't be everywhere at once, nor do I <br/>
expect them to be.  I think a little level headness is required here, which is <br/>
something that many don't seem to have in this case.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I would hate to see this group go.  I really enjoy reading many <br/>
of the posts I read every day, and hearing from many of the letterboxing <br/>
friends that I have made since I joined a year ago.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel, personally, that you would like to leave the chat group due to <br/>
this, then fine.  Quit the group.  However, there are more than 1000 members of <br/>
this group and shutting down the site for the rest of us would be down right <br/>
wrong.  I feel that a person (like a spam mailer) joined the group to get his <br/>
information into the group.  Just like many of us get spam in our e-mail, spam <br/>
may get into file folders.  Do you quit AOL (or any other e-mail program) <br/>
because you received spam?<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong, I am not for pornographic material in any form.  I just <br/>
feel that some level headness needs to happen here before people start shutting <br/>
chat groups down.<br/>

Three cheers for your level-headed reply to this little problem.  <br/>
It's just a problem, and problems get solved, no need to get <br/>
hysterical.<br/>
