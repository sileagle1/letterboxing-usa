My Peterborough boxes (Shieling Forest and Noone Falls) are about an hour
away from Manchester.  I think you're pretty central to where many
of the letterboxes are in NH - if you go about an hour east, you'll be
in the Rye Beach area where there are several as well.  If you visit
the Peterborough boxes, give me a call and maybe we can get together for
a cup of coffee?  I've yet to meet more letterboxers after my initial
visit with Susan and Erik Davis almost 4 years ago.
</p><p>Right now, the roads are pretty wet, there's some snow, but it's a little
dense due to the precip. today.  It's not that cold either.
