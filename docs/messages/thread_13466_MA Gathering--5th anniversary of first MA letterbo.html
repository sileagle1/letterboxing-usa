The gathering will be held at Wendell State Forest in Wendell, MA (where the first l'box was placed by Bonnie Sennott).  We have reserved the pavilion for this event. We are open to suggestions on how to make this a fun and interesting gathering for all. The park is open from 8am-8pm, we plan on starting at ll:00. At present there are 5 letterboxes in the park but we hope to add more. Would love to hear from anyone interested in attending or participating in any way.<br/>
