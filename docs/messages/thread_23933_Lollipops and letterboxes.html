became very enthusiastic in placing boxes and made nice logbooks, and put<br/>
cool first finder's prizes in her boxes, and wound up being a pretty good<br/>
carver.  The first of her boxes I found was on a warming Spring day, and the<br/>
FF prize was a chocolate bar!  What a good thing I found the box soon after<br/>
she planted it and not months later as wasn't unusual at that time.<br/>
