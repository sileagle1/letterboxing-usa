                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad to see that the argument part of this discussion was short and was able<br/>
to end well. I've met Lenny a few times. I think of him as a good man. He<br/>
was upset by a bad day. Emails were taken the wrong way and he posted some<br/>
unfortuneate statements. It looks to me like he soon realized his mistake.<br/>
When you do something wrong there is only one thing you can do to make it<br/>
right. He did this. He apologized. His first statements were made publicly<br/>
and so were his apologies. Lenny, I hope you are reading this. In my book,<br/>
you proved my first impressions of you correct. You are an honorable man.<br/>
Glad to see that all concerned were able to work this out. I'm glad I was<br/>
out away from the computer all day. (I'm on vacation). I remember a few good<br/>
arguments on the list that I wish I hadn't gotten into. It was nice to see<br/>
one end quickly and with everybody happy.....Chuck and Molly<br/>
