                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, after buying Randy's book, Team PresSinOn was determined to <br/>
find one of his boxes. So we spent the day yesterday trying to find <br/>
two, but came up empty handed. :(<br/>
We got a late start and had a somewhat long drive in front of us. (I <br/>
have to be vague since being more exact "could" give away the <br/>
location of the boxes.) So we got to our destination after stopping <br/>
for lunch first, and ended up walking around for about an hour <br/>
without finding the box. We were trying for "Witness:The Lost <br/>
Footage". We *think* we were in the right town, but can't be sure. <br/>
It's possible that it could be in one other town. We had a nice time <br/>
wandering around anyway, and saw alot of interesting things.<br/>
The second box we tried for was "Speaking in Ancient Tongues". We <br/>
know where it is (approximately) but can't figure out how to get to <br/>
that point. We spent about an hour walking through the woods on this <br/>
one, and didn't find anything we were looking for (landmarks or the <br/>
box). We didn't want to turn around and walk back to the car on the <br/>
same trail we were on, and it didn't loop around either. So I ended <br/>
up leaving the team in a clearing by the side of the road, while I <br/>
went back for the car. I walked along the road, which wasn't a good <br/>
idea since there was no shoulder and hills on both sides. I had to <br/>
stop a few times to let cars pass, so when it was clear, I ran the <br/>
rest of the way. WHEW! <br/>
We spent alot of the time yesterday saying "Curse you, mapsurfer" but <br/>
it was all in fun. We're not cursing him. He's just very frustrating. <br/>
LOL<br/>
We're still determined to find at least one of his boxes, but we <br/>
think we need to email him to see if we're lookin' in the right town. <br/>
Hmmmm......<br/>
