make a fine 99,100 outing.  We have really enjoyed coloring them.<br/>
<br/>
I like counting "all" the stamps so I'm working on 250 FPX.  Though <br/>
I'm not going to get overly concerned about the numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to "Peace of DC".<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting and hope to see you on the trail,<br/>

&gt; It should have been a dark and stormy night when we set out to <br/>
find the Dr. <br/>
&gt; Frankenstein's boxes.  There should have been lightening, thunder <br/>
and heavy <br/>
&gt; rains.  But, since we'd been experiencing that for the entire <br/>
Spring, we <br/>
&gt; were happy to set out under the sunshine!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After boxing for almost a year (anniversary in Sept), team BeMa <br/>
was in <br/>
&gt; search of our 100th Find (boxes or HH -- we count exchanges <br/>
separately)!!  <br/>
&gt; We were at number 98 and Dr. Frankenstein (cleverly hiding under <br/>
the name <br/>
&gt; "Rich") had placed two boxes at Providence Rec center.  The ground <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; familiar for it was here that the infamous Ha had basically failed <br/>
her puppy <br/>
&gt; obedience course (before it was cancelled due to the sniper).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We parked in the lot and searched for the paved path.  Ironically, <br/>
we parked <br/>
&gt; right in front of where we would end up, but, ended up making a <br/>
circuit of <br/>
&gt; the whole lot looking for the paved path and then following right <br/>
back!  <br/>
&gt; Hate when that happens!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The search was amazingly uneventful for our crew!  At Frankenbox, <br/>
Be decided <br/>
&gt; to poke the nice log we were sitting on to stamp.  Out from a <br/>
little hole <br/>
&gt; came a torrent of ants, swarming all over the log sending Miss Ma <br/>
screaming <br/>
&gt; and ink pads flying!  O.K.  -- so that was a little exciting...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We headed back on the path toward Bride of Frankenbox optimistic <br/>
that number <br/>
&gt; 100F was at hand!!  What a nice clear clue -- cut logs on both <br/>
sides of the <br/>
&gt; path -- you don't miss that too easily!  After circling around the <br/>
logs the <br/>
&gt; wrong way, we found the box.  Lo and behold -- within Bride of <br/>
Frankenbox <br/>
&gt; was an old friend -- the Cooties HH!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, some people get really nice, almost poetic boxes to mark <br/>
major <br/>
&gt; milestones such as the 100th find (or in the case of CT boxers -- <br/>
100th for <br/>
&gt; that afternoon...)  We get the choice of Bride of Frankenbox <br/>
(which I refuse <br/>
&gt; to take personally being the closest thing to a bride on the team -<br/>
- Miss Ma <br/>
&gt; is way too young although she has her future fianc picked out <br/>
already  -- <br/>
&gt; and a back up one just in case....) or a case of the Cooties!!  <br/>
The choices <br/>
&gt; may not be romantic or inspirational, but, we were extremely <br/>
excited to <br/>
&gt; reach 100 and start on the next 100 right away!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you to Rich for some more great clues.  We loved seeing all <br/>
the boxes <br/>
&gt; from which you borrowed directions!  You are very creative!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We look forward to putting our LBNA patch on our backpack so you <br/>
can all <br/>
&gt; look for it if we pass in the woods!  Although, knowing us, it <br/>
won't be the <br/>
&gt; first thing you'll see or hear if we are anywhere close by!!  BeMa<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; P9 (Peace of DC will be replanted soon)  F100!!<br/>
