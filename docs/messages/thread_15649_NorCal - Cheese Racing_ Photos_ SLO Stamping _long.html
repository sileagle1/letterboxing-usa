<br/>
I cannot remember a finer time than we had at the Norcal Event, Sept <br/>
16, 2003. As I told Double Sag as we left, "You folks set the bar <br/>
pretty darned high!" That goes for everyone who was there. <br/>
<br/>
An event like that takes planning, coordination, and service from the <br/>
folks who "run" it. From securing the park site to getting that <br/>
mailbox, carving and planting the boxes to making sure there was <br/>
charcoal, med kits, and water there, all those things needed the <br/>
locals' attention. Further, all the folks who showed up we so darned <br/>
friendly and helpful, too. That was evident. We had toddlers to <br/>
seniors out there enjoying the day. <br/>
<br/>
As JugglerMouse put it, "It was like we were at a family reunion with <br/>
cousins we had never met." I put in, "Yeah, but nobody got drunk, <br/>
mad, or made inappropriate come-ons to anyone." <br/>
<br/>
Okay, we did not feel free to cheeserace there. You have seen the <br/>
polls (posted in the polls section of this site.) You know how split <br/>
the vote is. If only more of you had voted! IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO <br/>
VOTE, you know. You may vote even if you have no intention of cheese <br/>
racing and none of being at the SLO Stamping in the Meadow, Oct 4th. <br/>
It is like the California Recall election: it is free to the voters <br/>
(okay, not true about the recall), it has a lot of silly choices, and <br/>
will probably be meaningless overall. See? You should vote or you <br/>
will have no excuse for complaining - and no one wants that!<br/>
<br/>
I put some photos up in the Photo section on the site (the Nor Cal <br/>
folder had already been created.) Surely there were more pics of <br/>
individuals. Come on, folk! I apologize for forgetting the names of <br/>
the lovely trio wearing the black hats (and the blonde baby). Can <br/>
someone help me there? I will ammend the caption under "Group with <br/>
Double Sag" once I get that.<br/>
<br/>
Here are somethings to look for at SLO Stamping, Oct 4th:<br/>
<br/>
Easier terrain - if hard hikes are your thing, we do have some stamps <br/>
nearby that will challenge you, but the event site is wheelchair <br/>
friendly.<br/>
<br/>
An Event Stamp - Emily Rose has promised us a double-sided one, too. <br/>
I understand that the other event stamps will get here, too. <br/>
<br/>
Randomized Clue List - since the park is so small, we will most <br/>
likely have the boxes in differing orders so more folk can get the <br/>
thrill of decoding them by themselves. <br/>
<br/>
Food - we are still encouraging potluck fare but we will have at <br/>
least hot dogs (probably chicken dogs) and a few veggie entres. Those <br/>
attending should consider bringing other things. There are soda <br/>
machines on site.<br/>
<br/>
Fake rock display - I will bring some examples and may well carve <br/>
some for you.<br/>
<br/>
Juggling lessons - JugglerMouse has promised to teach anyone <br/>
interested. She is a very good teacher and very encouraging.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of Exchanges<br/>
<br/>
A local list of boxes fairly close to the site - now if they are <br/>
boxes which need decoding, such as my Middle Earth series, I would <br/>
advise you to have them worked upon already. No gimmes; you would not <br/>
respect me for that, would you?<br/>
<br/>
BTW, if you can show me two of the Redwall series, I have Urthstripe <br/>
the Badger to stamp in your book. If you can show JugglerMouse two <br/>
from Redwall, she has a new Martin the Warrior. Both are countable as <br/>
finds.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, again, to the NorCal gathering. Y'all come on down South to <br/>
San Luis (pronounced "Lewis") Obispo on October 4th.<br/>
<br/>
Merriest of Meetings,<br/>
