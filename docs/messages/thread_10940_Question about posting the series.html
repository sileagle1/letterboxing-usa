                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, against Butterfly's advice, I went letterboxing instead of <br/>
studying yesterday.I sprung Aaron early from school and dragged him <br/>
along. Hows that for a bad influence. Had a great time and planted 4 <br/>
more boxes. Aarons Birthday Box and three additional presidents( for <br/>
a total of 4, that makes 6 @ Hop Brook thus far )<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my question is should I post each box seprately or run it as <br/>
a long series? Keep in mind there are 43 presidents and maybe 44 by <br/>
the time I have finished carving all these stamps. Also how would I <br/>
add to the previous clues so people would know I added new boxes. <br/>
Should I not post clues until I have more boxes placed? Sorry if I am <br/>
confusing you. <br/>
<br/>
I will try to place as many as I can over the next couple of weeks <br/>
then I will have to be content to simply carve as I found out last <br/>
night I will need another operation on my legs...this will be three <br/>
in 1 1/2 years, it's sort of getting old(sniff sniff).<br/>
<br/>
So I would sure appreciate any clue posting advice you can offer!!<br/>

have opined that 43 stamps is too much for one park (unless you live <br/>
in CT then it's just about right! teehee)  But I wouldn't assume that <br/>
all of them would be planted in one park - why should they be?  I've <br/>
seen series spread out in different parks. And I don't think you <br/>
should hold up planting until all the stamps are done.  Plant as you <br/>
go along.  It would be like the state quarters - they are being issued <br/>
over about 10 years.  <br/>

Check out Ryan Carpenter's African Safari series. These stamps are <br/>
hidden in the Columbia River Gorge in Washington and Oregon! He has <br/>
been working on this series for 2 years and is still adding to it!! <br/>

Some of the hikes are all day affairs and others are drive-bys. It is <br/>
a series of variety. <br/>

Definitely post to the board as you go along. It will be easier on you<br/>
certainly, and it will probably be easier on the webmanager of your<br/>
region.<br/>
<br/>
 Also how would I <br/>
&gt; add to the previous clues so people would know I added new boxes. <br/>

<br/>
I would just write at the beginning of each new box you post that this<br/>
is number whatever in your Presidents Series. And presumably your<br/>
webmanager will add it to the ones that have already gone up on<br/>
letterboxing.org, so boxers can see them all together in the same<br/>
section of the site.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will try to place as many as I can over the next couple of weeks <br/>
&gt; then I will have to be content to simply carve as I found out last <br/>

I hope your operation goes well and that this is the last one! <br/>
<br/>
&gt; So I would sure appreciate any clue posting advice you can offer!!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps. A series of 43 stamps will be an impressive body of<br/>
work, not to mention a mountain of Rubbermaid! You go, girl!<br/>

I <br/>
&gt; add to the previous clues so people would know I added new boxes. <br/>
&gt; Should I not post clues until I have more boxes placed? Sorry if I <br/>
am <br/>
&gt; confusing you. <br/>

My preference is that a series be posted by the area where the box<br/>
(es) are located.<br/>
<br/>
Usually I decide on where I would like to go for a walk on a day, <br/>
and I look on the web site for boxes that are in that park or <br/>
recreation area.  If you post together on one page all the boxes <br/>
that can be reached by walking from one parking lot, that would be a <br/>
good way to organize them.<br/>
<br/>
Another way would be to post together on one page all the boxes that <br/>
are within one town.  That way a boxer could take a driving tour of <br/>
the town to look for part of a series of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations on going for a long series of boxes.  I will be out <br/>
searching for boxes again after snow melt.<br/>
