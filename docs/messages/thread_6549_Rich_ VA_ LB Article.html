I first heard about letterboxing.)<br/>

Letter Perfect <br/>
Letterbox enthusiasts enjoy the thrill of the hunt.<br/>
by Earl Swift <br/>
July 24, 2002 <br/>
<br/>
They find the treasure in a fallen tree: a small, waterproof box <br/>
wedged deep in the log's hollow core, the hole capped with a river <br/>
jack, the rock obscured with the forest's leafy mulch. <br/>
<br/>
"I got it," Rhett announces, an arm elbow-deep inside. They have <br/>
hiked a half-hour to the spot, across a footbridge spanning the James <br/>
in downtown Richmond, up a sharp rise and into the woods, their <br/>
course planned with the help of clues they carried: "Go up the trail <br/>
no car can travel," and "At the four-way fork, take the path at 320 <br/>
degrees," and "At the next intersection go right down the `Jurassic <br/>
Park'-looking trail. You should be able to hear the river." <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They have followed the clues, all 15 of them, carefully. They have <br/>
little doubt that their quarry lies inside the log. Even so, as 12-<br/>
year-old Rhett pulls the Belle Isle letterbox from its hiding place, <br/>
Amy utters a gasp: "Oh my God." <br/>
<br/>
"Whoa," the Mer-man murmurs. <br/>
<br/>
"Look at it," Nature Barbie says. <br/>
<br/>
It is an almost mystical instant, the sort of shared revelation at <br/>
the heart of an old English pastime, "letterboxing," that combines <br/>
the scavenger hunt, visual art and orienteering, and now promises to <br/>
become an outdoors craze throughout the United States. <br/>
<br/>
Thousands of waterproof boxes are hidden in public places in all 50 <br/>
states  places like Richmond's Belle Isle, St. Paul's Church in <br/>
downtown Norfolk, and the summit of Virginia's highest peak. <br/>
<br/>
In each is a small log book and a rubber stamp, the latter usually <br/>
homemade and designed to evoke the box's location. The hobby's <br/>
faithful carry ink pads, their own logbooks and stamps they carve <br/>
with their personal marks. Following clues posted on the Web, they <br/>
hunt down the hidden caches, stamping their own books with the <br/>
letterbox stamp and the box's book with their own. <br/>
<br/>
Over time, the letterbox logbooks become records of the intrepid <br/>
souls who've trod through the woods and worked out the clues to find <br/>
them, and a letterboxer's book: a catalog of his travels, a passport <br/>
bearing the stamps of places he might otherwise not have ventured. <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is said to have started at Southwest England's Dartmoor <br/>
National Park in 1854. Over the decades that followed, boxes were <br/>
hidden by the hundreds in the park, and a small army of enthusiasts <br/>
sprang up to find them. <br/>
<br/>
It didn't cross the Atlantic in any large-scale sense for 144 years  <br/>
not until April 1998, when Smithsonian magazine ran a feature on <br/>
Dartmoor's latter-day letterboxers. Within weeks of the story's <br/>
appearance the hobby had gained a foothold in a half-dozen, far-flung <br/>
American towns.That April 26, a box appeared atop Max Patch on the <br/>
Appalachian Trail near Hot Springs, N.C.,. <br/>
<br/>
Max Patch is a majestic, windswept place an hour's drive from <br/>
Asheville, and so became a model for the settings that followed it: <br/>
Hiding places tend to be difficult to reach, points of great beauty, <br/>
or both. They're almost always worth visiting. <br/>
<br/>
Within a year, letterboxes were drawing people off the beaten path to <br/>
90 more such places. At last count, the number of boxes with Web-<br/>
posted clues had grown to 2,312. Ninety-three clues lead to sites in <br/>
Virginia. <br/>
<br/>
Those clues can make the hunt a mental, as well as physical, exercise.<br/>
<br/>
Some are straightforward directions. Some require the use of a <br/>
compass. Some, like the Russ Clan's clues to the St. Paul's <br/>
Cannonball letterbox, are sheer poetry: <br/>
<br/>
Find sweet John who was only seven, <br/>
<br/>
he's next to Fredrick, they are both in heaven. <br/>
<br/>
Next to the two, grows an unusual tree <br/>
<br/>
and there inside is the gift from me. <br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the hand-carved stamps stashed inside the boxes range from <br/>
florid to stick-figure. The Belle Isle stamp discovered by Rhett and <br/>
company was a Confederate battle flag. The St. Paul's box is <br/>
represented by a headstone, a church's rose window and the lodged <br/>
cannonball. The Ovals of Cassini stamp, hidden in the woods at First <br/>
Landing/Seashore State Park, is a minimalist combination of arcs and <br/>
lines. <br/>
<br/>
Many letterboxers jot observations about locale, weather or mood in a <br/>
box's logbook, but most remain anonymous, adopting a nom de plume or <br/>
letting their stamps serve as their signatures. <br/>
<br/>
So they devote great care to designing and carving the stamps that <br/>
will speak for them. Itty Bitty Kitty, a 43-year-old Norfolk <br/>
corporate vice president, marks her visits with the hand-carved image <br/>
of a curled cat. Nature Barbie, a Virginia Beach 8-year-old, is <br/>
represented by a smirking platypus. Rhett leaves behind a wriggling <br/>
diamondback. <br/>
<br/>
With a little practice, carving even a complicated design isn't hard. <br/>
And among the hobby's many attractions  along with its mystery, the <br/>
rush of discovery, nature's sounds and smells  is that it's cheap. <br/>
To get started, a letterboxer needs only a notebook, ink pad, and the <br/>
tools and rubber-carving medium needed to make his or her stamp  a <br/>
one-time outlay of less than $15. <br/>
<br/>
Then, one need only log on to the Letterboxing North America Web <br/>
site, the country's readiest source of clues, at <br/>
www.letterboxing.org. Clues are organized by states and regions <br/>
within each, making it easy for families planning auto trips to <br/>
incorporate letterboxing into their travels. <br/>
<br/>
"It seemed like an adventurous thing to do with the kids," says Itty <br/>
Bitty Kitty, who learned of the hobby from friends. "When I went on <br/>
the Web site, I was excited by the fact that enough people thought it <br/>
was cool that there were a lot of boxes hidden locally." <br/>
<br/>
On Belle Isle, the foursome ink their stamps and press them into the <br/>
pages of the letterbox log  the snake, the platypus, Amy's steaming <br/>
cup of coffee, the Mer-man's primitive sea creature  they take turns <br/>
stamping the flag into their own books. <br/>
<br/>
Then they carefully repack the letterbox's contents into Baggies and <br/>
seal them inside the plastic storage container. Rhett eases the box <br/>
back into the log. Nature Barbie replaces the rock. <br/>
<br/>
They leave no hint of treasure. <br/>
<br/>
But carry away proof that they'd found it. S<br/>
