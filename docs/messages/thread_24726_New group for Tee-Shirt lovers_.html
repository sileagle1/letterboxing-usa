Unpleasant, negative lunatics with sever psychological problems who <br/>
lash out at others and throw insults around simply are not welcome. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry, but that's just he way it is. Everyone is in a position to <br/>
CHOOSE who they spend their time with. <br/>
<br/>
Me? I choose pleasant, happy, motivated people who encourage others <br/>
to try new, positive things. <br/>
<br/>
If that describes you then come on over! You are welcome!<br/>
<br/>
No need to ever mention this in THIS group ever again. Just move on. <br/>
Inject your venom on something or someone else. after all, I'm <br/>

I think this post is really a great one! I'm not tossing out any <br/>
slurs to stargazermomma as I realize this is written scastically.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Looking back over the most recent thread (now defunct)all of the <br/>
folks that post regularly or have posted in the past here stayed <br/>
pretty civil. Yeh I could have been more PC, but I wasn't calling <br/>
anyone any names nor was anyone else that posted opposing views to <br/>
the T-shirt deal. We merely voiced opposition to the concept, or <br/>
needed further explanation.<br/>
<br/>
New ideas come and go. Ideas should be challenged, and in doing so <br/>
can become great ideas or sometimes get dumped. Challenging an idea <br/>
is not challenging the person personally nor is it an an attack on <br/>
the person's character. Defending that idea can be difficult, but if <br/>
it is your idea then don't take the challenge personally.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the T-shirt poster, and a few others, didn't understand <br/>
that the challenge wasn't a personal one and that is when the slurs <br/>
were tossed out. <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately Randy used his perogative in a timely manner, and the <br/>
list has calmed down.<br/>
