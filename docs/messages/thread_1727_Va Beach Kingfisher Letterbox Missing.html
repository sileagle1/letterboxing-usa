<div>I was checking on my letterboxes today and found 
Kingfisher disturbed by an animal.  The lid was closed but the 
box was 20 feet from where I hid it and covered with teeth marks.  This is 
apparently the second time.  Someone must have found it opened before 
because there were teeth marks on the notebook and the pen, it was wet inside, 
and the bag had been replaced.  Thanks to whomever replaced it the first 
time!  Everything was inside but the wood backing on the stamp was wet 
and had warped.  I've taken it out of action until I can get it 
repaired. I think I'll replace the container too.  It was brand new and had 
never been used for food.  The only thing I can think of that would attract 
the animals is the paint I used to camouflage it.  My other two boxes are 
painted also but I used a different paint for this one. Must have been what 
attracted the animals. Anyone else ever have a problem with 
animals?</div>

Mark, got your email....Isn't it fun finding and rehiding those <br/>
hitchhikers.  My hunt for Kingfisher and Fox Run was cut short last <br/>
week...I ran out of daylight.  I started the Cape Henry trail from <br/>
the back parking lot trailhead and realized I'd run out of light <br/>
before I reached the area of the trail your clues included. I'll look <br/>
forward to trying for them again when you fix up Kingfisher.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you have a great visit to Richmond.  I'd suggest the Meadow Farm <br/>
box...it's an easy walk and the girls will love the live animals <br/>
which are always out. Don't miss the hogs in the back...they are good <br/>
at hiding behind their fence.  The Pocohontas boxes are good with <br/>
kids as well.  Try for those and you may just find another <br/>
hitchhiker. The Belle Isle box is lots of fun, but the walk over the <br/>
river on the bridge might be a challenge with triplets.  There are <br/>
great sights to see down there though.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and have a great rest of the weekend!<br/>
