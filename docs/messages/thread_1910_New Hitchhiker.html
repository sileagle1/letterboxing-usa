                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday I added a new hitchhiker into the letterboxing population.I <br/>
call it "My Favorite Groundhog." It's pretty unique because it has a <br/>
two sided stamp. One side depicts a groundhog emerging from his hole, <br/>
and the other, birthday wishes to my daughter, born 2/2/89. The <br/>
stamps were cut by good friend Ladybug, (Kathy, in Va.) and as far as <br/>
I know it's the first double sided stamp to hit the population. What <br/>
to do when and if you find it is entirely up to you folks, choose <br/>
your favorite or stamp both into your journals. Ponder over wether to <br/>
add one, or two to your "F" count. Anyway, enough said, enjoy the <br/>
stamp. Credit for putting the box together goes to Katybug and Boop. <br/>

Keep in mind there's a lot about letterboxing that is not necessarily <br/>
posted or discussed on this list, or even on any of the letterboxing <br/>
websites, so one needs to be cautious when making such statements.  I <br/>
know for a fatc of al teast one such double-sided stamp out west <br/>
somewhere, and it's been around for over a year :-)<br/>

<div>I have a DBL sided ready to

image and one the text. I counted it as one box.</div>

I think it would be a mistake to be too cautious about making <br/>
statements concerning what it is personally unique and special about <br/>
each stamp or letterbox.  Keep in mind that each person's experience <br/>
of something new and different is no less special and worthy of <br/>
comment simply because there may be others out there.  One thing for <br/>
certain, sharing excitement and impressions about new experiences <br/>
will bring forth others who want to share their like experiences.<br/>

Besides, he did say "As far as I know". So, there was absolutely nothing <br/>
wrong with what he said.<br/>

daughter. I could have taken it out and found it a permanent home <br/>
nearby so Renee and I could periodically check on it, but another <br/>
gift, given to my daughter, by the same friends at Christmas time has <br/>
already been planted in that manner. (See Gift to Renee) I really <br/>
couldn't see two such boxes in the same area, so I decided to make <br/>
this a Hitchhiker. Inside the journal of this hitchhiker is a note to <br/>
those finding it. It is my hope the one of you finding it after it's <br/>
been in circulation for awhile would mail it back to Renee, so she <br/>
could see who has left her BDay wishes. Perhaps the solution to the <br/>
problem of over populating hitch hikers is to give them a time limit <br/>
where after the limit is reached the next finder of such box could <br/>
send it to it's owner. That way the owner could see where it's been <br/>
and we wouldn't need the hitch hiker page to keep track off them.<br/>
