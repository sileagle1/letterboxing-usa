in it for the numbers (though I do keep a tally). Many of the boxes I place<br/>
are mysteries (most not very hard) but we love the mental challenge of<br/>
solving and coming up with cryptic clues (better than watching TV). We also<br/>
do lots of regular boxes, because I love finding a beautifully carved stamp,<br/>
a surprise hitchhiker, and also love the variety in exercise (I get bored<br/>
with exercise very quickly) because we get to go to so many different<br/>
wonderful places. For me the more difficult challenges have been physical,<br/>
rather than mental, but I've surprised myself a number of times by being<br/>
able to walk further than I thought I could, or tackle a steep hill, etc.<br/>
Some of the bigger letterboxing challenges ahead of me are actually<br/>
non-mystery boxes that take more effort to get to. I'll probably be just as<br/>
thrilled at getting them!<br/>
<br/>
What's neat about this pastime is that there is something for everyone<br/>
(mentally, physically, esthetically, creatively, hard, easy). I tend to<br/>
place the types of boxes that I like to find. And in answer to your<br/>
question - we'd search out both boxes - probably enjoy both - but would be<br/>
most satistified with the difficult one (but difficult doesn't just mean a<br/>
difficult clue).<br/>
<br/>
OK, I better stop avoiding work now....<br/>

easy boxes - instant gratification. We enjoy looking for boxes easy and <br/>
difficult. A few of our outings have been fruitless due to missing <br/>
letterboxes so we're going after the newly planted boxes instead. We've been <br/>
thrilled to discover areas we would never have ventured out to and that <br/>
itself is a great reward.  Whenever we go out of town we first check the <br/>
letterboxing website to get clues for that area. I'm sure this will become a <br/>
lifelong hobby for us and are appreciative of those taking the time to plant <br/>
the boxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Difficult boxes can also mean different things to different people.  <br/>
I for one (and Butterfly can attest to this) totally suck at mystery <br/>
boxes.  Could be because I am a concrete random thinker and I like <br/>
to find new ways to do things, where as an abstract random or <br/>
sequential thinker may think a mystery is "easy". <br/>
<br/>
Others find orienteering difficult and may think a set of clues with <br/>
nothing but paces and bearings are difficult, whereas I think its a <br/>
snap.  <br/>
<br/>
Even my wife and I have different ideas of difficult... she's got a <br/>
bit of asthma and I find myself having to slow up on long hills to <br/>
let her catch her breath. Of course if Madras and I are out <br/>
together, she pulls me up the hill by her leash and I'm trotting <br/>
after her.  <br/>
<br/>
I think as far as difficult vs. easy boxes: you know going into the <br/>
hike that you're getting a stamp as a reward. If you want more, try <br/>
geocaching!  I think the best reward someone can give is a view and <br/>
an education.  As I place more boxes I'm borrowing an idea from <br/>
someone...including a tidbit of information that the average person <br/>
might not know.  And If I can take you through an area that you <br/>
might never have seen, then a bonus for you!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are so many things that factor in...  While traveling, I like <br/>
it when there are a few easier, shorter boxes along my route...  or a <br/>
mystery box that I can figure out before I leave (i.e. via the web or <br/>
library).  While boxing in my own area, it just depends on the day.  <br/>
Usually I prefer mental challenges -- where I have to research, solve <br/>
a puzzle, think abstractly, use deductive reasoning.  This is not to <br/>
be confused with obscure clues, which are those that get you out on <br/>
the trail and provide scant information on which way to go or where <br/>
to find the box once you've reached the end of the clues.  Those are <br/>
just plain frustrating.  One stamp can certainly be a worthwhile day <br/>
if the box was challenging.  Other days, I just want to go out and <br/>
collect some stamps without too much thinking.  As far as the <br/>
likelihood of finding a HH being greater at a more frequently visited <br/>
box, that would not affect my decision one way or another.  I am not <br/>
really all that big on finding HHs.<br/>
<br/>
As far as creating boxes...  I've done both, some very easy ones <br/>
because this area is very new to letterboxing and it is nice for <br/>
newer letterboxers to have the instant gratification of finding a box <br/>
right off the bat.  Now that the hobby is picking up around here, I <br/>
have been trying to do more variety, challenging clues and mystery <br/>
boxes.  These are really my preference to plant...  sometimes coming <br/>
up with the clue can be as challenging as solving it!<br/>
<br/>
It really is a great hobby, and there really is something for <br/>
everyone.<br/>

to work for it, either mentally or physically.  It's not just having <br/>
that rare stamp in the book, but joining that elite group in the box's <br/>
log book. One of my favorite boxes so far was the Salmon River Trout <br/>
Box, an "add on" to Covered Bridge &amp; Verde, in East Hampton CT.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it doesn't really disappoint us too badly if we <br/>
come up empty handed. Half the fun is in the hunt, and we still hike <br/>
just for the pleasure of it, even when the letterboxes are done.  <br/>
<br/>
We also like hiking in the snow, and when there is snow, our success <br/>
rate has been just under 50%. We don't mind, we do it anyway. When we <br/>
miss a box, we go back sooner or later, and it's nice to see the same <br/>
place in a different season. Nature is always a fresh show.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Peronsally, I love the challenging clues where I have to figure out riddles and beg for hints.  I live in Legerdemaine country and very few (if any) of those boxes are straightforward and simple.  I enjoy any boxes I find but there is a certain extra thrill in finding a box on the third time.  I can't imagine finding more than 2 or 3 boxes in one day.  I guess I enjoy the challenge. (And I'm really bad at firguing some things out so it's a good thing I DO enjoy the extra challenge.  I've gone back 4 times on some boxes before finally nabbing them!)Memlili<br/>

Assume there's two letterboxes within a convienent distance of your<br/>
house, neither of which was placed by you.  <br/>
<br/>
The first is incredibly straight forward.  "Start here, walk this many<br/>
paces, turn left, follow trail, turn right, letterbox is behind the<br/>
rock."  Your reward is a stamp in your journal.<br/>
<br/>
The second is murderously impossible.  The clues are written in<br/>
cipher, if not a foreign language.  Even after you have the clues,<br/>
they're nearly impossible to solve.  After multiple trips to the<br/>
library, sleepless nights with paper and pencil and multiple<br/>
unsuccessful excursions, you figure out where the letterbox is.  Your<br/>
reward is a stamp in your journal.<br/>
<br/>
Are "bragging rights" sufficient compensation for the additional<br/>
effort?  You spend far more time searching for one box when you could<br/>
be acquiring multiple stamps from easier boxes.  Your chances of<br/>
finding a hitchhiker are greatly diminished simply because the book is<br/>
visited less often.  Was it worth it?  Are you prouder of that stamp<br/>
in your logbook?  What about the box maker?  You have to realize that<br/>
your box will be visited far less often.  Is knowing that success will<br/>
be sweeter for those who find it, make up for the additional<br/>
frustration of those who don't?<br/>

&gt; Wow! I'm thrilled to hear that there's a solution to that one! I keep<br/>
