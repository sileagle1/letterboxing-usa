html-ignorance, but I think it points to a page that the template<br/>

can leave a note on a page's server). I'll try manually removing it<br/>
from the source code and see what happens.<br/>

for Enable style sheets, I could no longer access Jay's pages at AOL.<br/>
<br/>
Randy and Bonnie, you might want to see if that feature is checked on <br/>
your settings, and if so, disable it.<br/>
<br/>
This may not be the problem, as I was still able to load Jay's saved <br/>
pages, and Randy could not.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, Jay's removing the offending line from all his pages <br/>
would be the best solution.<br/>
