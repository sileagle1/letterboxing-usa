run of the mill letterboxes are good....i often box with my daughter and her<br/>
5year old and 10 month old, not to mention my 9 and 13 year old so the<br/>
easier ones are good for them. (and yes we do try to be responsible<br/>

 Welcome to the group!<br/>
I just couldn't help and respond to your post. It's great to see the<br/>
excitement that this hobby brings to people.<br/>
The first mystery is the best!! Now, you may not want to do the normal, run<br/>
of the mill letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

I'm so excited i found 3 letterboxes this weekend and i even carved <br/>
a stamp.I did see that there were baggies in the letterbox so i took <br/>
them out after reeding all of the letters on this chatlist. This is <br/>
such great fun. This so much more fun than geocaching. I love it. <br/>
Thanks for all the help i have been getting.I have a question about <br/>
the count thing and i think the f is for finds, and the p is for <br/>
placed? is the x for former, like in x husbands? or does it stand <br/>
for something else? Wher do you keep tract of your finds? Is there <br/>
many others letterboers in LA?<br/>

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br/>
<br/>
If the bags were *inside* the box, protecting the logbook and protecting the <br/>
stamp, they were definitely likely meant to be there.  I always double-bag the <br/>
logbook in each of our placed boxes, single-bag the stamp separately, and <br/>
then if I include an inkpad (which I haven't been doing lately) that's also in <br/>
it's own separate baggie.  So my boxes will actually contain 4 bags.<br/>
<br/>
And some placers *do* bag the box itself and want it that way.<br/>
<br/>
A good rule of thumb might be, rather than change anything drastically, when <br/>
you get home go to the letterboxing.org website and click on "contact placer" <br/>
on that particular box's page and let the placer know when you found the box <br/>
and what condition it was in.  Then they can decide if there's a problem or <br/>
not. <br/>
<br/>
I used to think it might be better to just put it at the end of the clues as <br/>
to how the box should be put together.  I know sometimes after stamping in <br/>
it's hard to remember exactly how the placer might have had something, and one <br/>
never knows if the boxer before them put it back together properly or not <br/>
anyway.  So I thought it might be better to put it on the clue sheet.  But when I <br/>
did that, a lot of folks didn't seem to pay much attention to it anyway.<br/>

I'm so excited i found 3 letterboxes this weekend and i even carved <br/>
a stamp.I did see that there were baggies in the letterbox so i took <br/>
them out after reeding all of the letters on this chatlist. This is <br/>
such great fun. This so much more fun than geocaching. I love it. <br/>
Thanks for all the help i have been getting.I have a question about <br/>
the count thing and i think the f is for finds, and the p is for <br/>
placed? is the x for former, like in x husbands? or does it stand <br/>
for something else? Wher do you keep tract of your finds? Is there <br/>
many others letterboers in LA?<br/>

&gt; I'm so excited i found 3 letterboxes this weekend and i even carved <br/>
&gt; a stamp.I did see that there were baggies in the letterbox so i took <br/>
&gt; them out after reeding all of the letters on this chatlist.<br/>
Eek! Those little baggies need to get back to their homes right away, before the next <br/>
storm. They were certainly meant to be there to protect the logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I have a question about <br/>
&gt; the count thing and i think the f is for finds, and the p is for <br/>
&gt; placed? is the x for former, like in x husbands?<br/>
When you meet another letterboxer, it's customary to exchange the image of each of <br/>
your signature stamps.  I, for one, have never kept count and don't have a clue how <br/>
many I have but some folks keep a runnung tally of these exchanges and call them <br/>
their X count.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  or does it stand for something else? Wher do you keep tract of your finds? <br/>
Once again, this is optional. If do you choose to keep a record of the boxes you've <br/>
found, you can officially log them on Atlas Quest. Only boxes which are posted on <br/>
that site will show up in your count. Otherwise, it's up to you to keep the count in <br/>
your own logbook. <br/>
<br/>
Be sure to have a look at the FAQs on several of the excellent sites to be found on the <br/>
web regarding letterboxing, such as: www.letterboxinging.info , www.atlasquest.com  <br/>
, www.letterboxing.org  Good luck, Funhog<br/>
