                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
On Monday, I took my 73 yr old mother-in-law letterboxing. I had been telling her about it and she really seemed interested (&amp; she likes to walk), so I carved her a sig stamp that says "Rusty" (the nickname she's had since she was little - a shortening of her maiden name) and off we went. For the first boxes, I helped her out with the clues because it was my Harry Potter series and the clues are a bit cryptic for a newbie that is unsure of herself. <br/>
After that, she found 3 boxes more all on her own. She is definitely 'infected' with the letterboxing bug! It was so cute watching her get excited when she found 'the bridge' mentioned in the clues, then she found the 'large tree' from the clues and when she got to the first box she found without my help I thought she said "I found it!" loud enough to draw the attention of anyone else within a mile! It was great to share her enthusiasm. <br/>
After we left the woods, we went straight to Hobby Lobby to get her a journal (since I only had plain paper for her to stamp on &amp; I didn't know ahead of time if she would like the hobby or what kind of log book she would want). She picked out a nice leather covered one and we also looked at stamps. Based on the ones she liked, I downloaded the images of similar things that I can carve for her, but haven't had a chance to see if she likes any of them. <br/>
So it looks like I'll have another boxin' partner for the weekday mornings when Franzsolo has to work :-) Don't worry Franz, we won't go to Chilo without you.<br/>
Rusty doesn't have computer access, but if she gets hooked enough to plant some, I'll be happy to help her out.<br/>
<br/>
Box on!<br/>

That is just too cute for words!<br/>
It's so important for people of all ages<br/>
to keep active and what better way to do so<br/>
then strolling through the woods with a <br/>
letterboxing partner and finding those boxes!!<br/>
Good for you and good for Rusty - a warm welcome to her from <br/>
TeamGreenDragon - ;)<br/>
