<br/>
I lost my hiking stick on October 27 while hiking the Metacomet blue blazed trail across from the Penwood Park parking lot.  I'm fairly certain I had it when I got up to the powerlines.  I put it down somewhere along the grasses where the powerline trail goes to the left.  It is stained brown, has a black rubber tip on the bottom, is a twisted design, and has a rawhide loop near the top of the stick.  <br/>
<br/>
I've gone back twice to look for it and a fellow letterboxer also scoured the area and didn't find it.  If you see it, please let me know and I will pick it up.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and Enjoy!<br/>
