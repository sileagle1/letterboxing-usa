                    <div class="plaintext-content">Some interesting facts. In an endemic area 85% of the ticks will be pos for <br/>
lyme disease. It takes between 24 and 48 hours for an infected tick to infect a <br/>
person once attached. The person is infected when the tick has gorged itself <br/>
and regurgitates,(pleasant thought) so if ticks are removed within a few hours <br/>
of one's outing no testing or treatment is required unless a rash or <br/>
unexplained symptoms develop. The Park workers on Long Island check each other at the <br/>
end of each shift and have very low rates of infestation. There is a vaccine <br/>
for lyme but unfortunately it is only 50 % effective. <br/>

<br/>
    All you have to do is get some Vaseline on your finger, a good bit of<br/>
it, and slather it over the tick.  Cover it completely.  Wait a few minutes<br/>
and the Vaseline will make that tick back out of your skin, then you can<br/>
just pull it out easily.  I'm not sure what about the petroleum jelly makes<br/>
them do that, but maybe it cuts off their air supply or such as that.  Works<br/>
like a charm.  Works on pets, too.<br/>

pull them out when they start to back out.  Tweezers work fine too, but you<br/>
have to be extra careful to grab them as close to the skin as possible, or<br/>

Can you all help a city girl out?  I've seen photos of<br/>
ticks online, but in real life, how big are they<br/>
really?  Are they easy to spot if they've attached<br/>
themselves to you as you're doing your tick check<br/>
after the hike?  If they bite, do you feel it, or is<br/>
it more like a mosquito where you don't know you've<br/>
been bit until you see a bump after the fact?<br/>

hairline on the neck and they will clamp down anywhere.  Ticks can be <br/>
really tiny like John said, especially Deer Ticks, the kind that <br/>
spread lyme disease.  The adult bodies are 1/15 inch in diameter and <br/>
the nymphs are even smaller.  Dog ticks and Wood ticks are much <br/>
bigger, with bodies about 1/8 inch on diameter.  All ticks have 8 <br/>
legs, and unlike spiders, the legs look 'curly'.  You will not feel a <br/>
tick's bite, but you can feel the bigger ones crawling along on you.  <br/>
That's how I've noticed a few.  So, prevention is the best cure <br/>
and 'tick checks' are very important as well.<br/>
<br/>
The tickiest times of the year in eastern PA are May-July, but you <br/>
can get ticked on (pun intended) any time that the temps are above <br/>
freezing.<br/>
<br/>
Do not let this deter you from boxing fun, just be a little diligent <br/>
to reduce risks.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Deer tick nymphs (babies) can be very tiny -- even smaller than a pin<br/>
head. They are easy to not see at all, and even then they look a bit<br/>
like freckles. Adults are a little larger, a like a 1/16th of an inch.<br/>
See pic with ruller: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/images/4ticks_cm.jpg<br/>
<br/>
Their bite isn't noticable, no pain, no itch, no bump -- but they hang<br/>
on for two or three days making a small pool of unclotted blood then<br/>
when they're ready, they take a big suck and their body swells up (and<br/>
that's when they're most likely to inject you with the Lyme spyrochete<br/>
IF they carry it). I usually find them when I feel them crawling or my<br/>
husband will find them during the "tick check."<br/>
<br/>
So, if you are bit, you remove the tick and tape it to a card, write<br/>
your name, age, address, where on the body you were bit, and the<br/>
location you think you picked up the tick. Take it to your town health<br/>
department and they will send it to be tested and inform you by mail<br/>
of results (at least, that's how it works in CT).<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, the lab used to scrape out the guts of the tick &amp; look<br/>
for the spyrochete under a microscope, but now they mash up the whole<br/>
tick and get a DNA profile, looking for the markers indicating the<br/>
lyme germ. Pretty cool, eh?<br/>

I've found tick spoons work the best for removal. They look like a<br/>
very small spoon with a tapered slot in the end. You slide it between<br/>
the tick and the skin and pull - it usually removes the head as well<br/>
as the body. They sell them in drugstores and sporting goods stores.<br/>
<br/>
Deet works fairly well but has to be renewed often.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is the US Marine Corps solution - pantyhose! Haven't tried<br/>
that yet, but it would likely be effective but hot. And it only covers<br/>
half your body.<br/>

  Yep, pantyhose would be a really, really uncomfortable solution, but thanks for the visual of USMC tough guys (A Few Good Men in Tights?)<br/>
