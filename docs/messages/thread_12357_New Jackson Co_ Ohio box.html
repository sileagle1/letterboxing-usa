Jackson County Pride<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time, Jackson County was renowned for this.  We were told <br/>
in school that a man named Chapman (John was it?) played a big role <br/>
in promoting this here and other places across the frontier.  We <br/>
don't have much of it anymore but we've held onto the symbol as <br/>
anyone who looks over our county seat can easily see.  You'll be the <br/>
apple of our eye if you find our box, use our stamp, and leave your <br/>
stamp in our book for us to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
To find Jackson County Pride, go to Manpower Park in the city of <br/>
Jackson.  Manpower Park is located on east Main St. across from the <br/>
Jackson Square Shopping Center.  Once in the park, find the brown <br/>
historical marker for the Kanawha Trail.  At the marker, take a <br/>
compass bearing of 60 and walk 30 paces (2 steps = 1 pace) to the <br/>
Ridgeway tree.  At the tree, take a compass bearing of 30 and walk <br/>
13 paces to Old Glory.  At Old Glory, take a compass bearing of 340 <br/>
and walk 8 paces.  Look under the tall pine at the west end of the <br/>
Chamber of Commerce sign and you should find Jackson County Pride <br/>
hiding in the mulch.  Bring a stamp pad and a pencil!  Please be <br/>
discrete as there is a lot of traffic nearby.  After you find it, <br/>
please send us an email at bigguy_45640@yahoo.com and let us know if <br/>
it's needs any attention.  Thanks and happy hunting!<br/>
