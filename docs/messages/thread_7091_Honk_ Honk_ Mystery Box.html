<div>Our name: Sissy 
and CR<br/><br/>Box name: Honk! Honk! Mystery Box<br/><br/>Place: 
Secret<br/><br/>Placed: 8-18-02<br/><br/>Clues:<br/>- This place is billed as "the 
only place on earth that you will find all<br/>eight species of swans living 
together."<br/>- You must find a particular bench on which to sit yourself.<br/>- 
This bench is on a secluded grassy trail.<br/>- You will have enjoyed the sights 
and crossed a great bridge.<br/>- You will have then walked along a raised wooden 
trail.<br/>- You will have then come to the end and circled around again.<br/>- As 
you come to the end of the clearings you either must climb slighty to 
a<br/>gravely trail or choose two grassy ones further to your left.<br/>- You will 
also see a bench with it's back to the short rise--walk to it,<br/>but rest 
not.<br/>- Continue past the bench into the woods--woods to your left and the 
rise to<br/>your right--onto the narrow grassy trail.<br/>- The bench you seek 
will be the next one. Rest there.<br/>- Directly in front of you is "The Tree of 
Three," the largest tree you can<br/>see.<br/>- The Tree guards the 
box.<br/><br/>Take care when approaching "The Tree of Three" as people may be able 
to<br/>observe you above on the rise--you MUST look all around you before 
entering<br/>the woods.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy the area and the 
hunt.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>CR<br/><br/>PS:  Is the clues too hard?  
Please send feedback.  I've tried to write the<br/>clues so that when you 
are there, they are fairly obvious.
