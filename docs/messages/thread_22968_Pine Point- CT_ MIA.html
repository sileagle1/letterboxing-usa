                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all!  I know that Pine Point LB was visited successfully a month<br/>
ago, but between then &amp; now the box has vanished.  If anyone was there<br/>
after Nov. 28 &amp; saw the box could you let me know.  If anyone found<br/>
the box, but took it home for some TLC would you please let me know<br/>
(it's possible I included an old email address in the logbook).  <br/>
There's a hole in the Earth/stone where the box used to be, so it's<br/>
definitely gone; I'd like to salvage any of it that I can.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch!<br/>
The Family<br/>
