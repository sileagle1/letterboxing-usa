The "Cougar" Letterbox can be found near the campus of University of <br/>
Houston  Clear Lake.  The campus is tucked away in the trees near <br/>
many popular attractions, such as NASA's Space Center Houston, Armand <br/>
Bayou Nature Center, and the Kemah Boardwalk.   Armand Bayou Nature <br/>
Center is open daily from 9am  5pm.  The 1,800 acre park preserves <br/>
local plant and animal life, and includes the Jimmy Martyn Farm (a <br/>
working turn of the century farm).  Activities in the park include <br/>
hiking, canoeing, and birding.  What better place for a Cougar (or <br/>
Shasta as the mascot is named) to roam.   <br/>

&gt; The "Cougar" Letterbox can be found near the campus of University of<br/>
&gt; Houston  Clear Lake.  The campus is tucked away in the trees near<br/>
&gt; many popular attractions, such as NASA's Space Center Houston, Armand<br/>
&gt; Bayou Nature Center, and the Kemah Boardwalk.   Armand Bayou Nature<br/>
&gt; Center is open daily from 9am  5pm.  The 1,800 acre park preserves<br/>
&gt; local plant and animal life, and includes the Jimmy Martyn Farm (a<br/>
&gt; working turn of the century farm).  Activities in the park include<br/>
&gt; hiking, canoeing, and birding.  What better place for a Cougar (or<br/>
&gt; Shasta as the mascot is named) to roam.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Directions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From Houston, go South on I-45 to Bay Area Blvd.  Exit on Bay Area<br/>
&gt; Blvd East (you will loop around and cross over I-45) and stay on past<br/>
&gt; the University of Houston  Clear Lake campus on the right.  Armand<br/>
&gt; Bayou Nature Center will be on your right, after Bay Area Park, about<br/>
&gt; 4 miles from I-45.   Turn in at the entrance, and proceed to the<br/>
&gt; parking area.  Park, and go in to the fee station on your right ($3<br/>
&gt; entry fee).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To the letterbox:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From the Entry building, exit on the boardwalk, going west past the<br/>
&gt; Red Hawks cage (take a look at these beautiful birds).  Now follow<br/>
&gt; the boardwalk as it snakes through the swamp area.  You will pass<br/>
&gt; signs for "Wildlife", "Poison Ivy", "Raccoon", "Signs of<br/>
&gt; Wildlife", "Animal Tracks", then arrive at the pond with a big sign<br/>
&gt; with heading of "Wetlands".  With your back to the "Wetlands" sign,<br/>
&gt; walk 3 paces at 50 degrees to the boardwalk corner overlap (upper and<br/>
&gt; lower platform).  The box is tucked in the corner under the top<br/>
&gt; boardwalk.  Be very careful due to snakes in the park and this can be<br/>
&gt; a crowded area.  Now enjoy the rest of this park..<br/>
