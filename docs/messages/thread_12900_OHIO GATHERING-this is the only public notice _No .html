  We are almost to the Gathering Date and I think everyone thinks I'm Dead, <br/>
Well, Just half Dead.<br/>
<br/>
I have had an idea, Because my Wall Idea came down like the Berlin Wall, I <br/>
will bring the blocks to the gathering,  Next Weekend I will spend the day <br/>
placing these stamps all around the park, I will then (Like Last Year) bring <br/>
a copy of the clues for everyone and have a SUPER Hitch Hiker placing.  This <br/>
to say, You will have to find them and take them with you (Yes, More Trash <br/>
for your Car)<br/>
<br/>
I have Replaced the Log Books and made them into (Stand Beside Dinkets or <br/>
SBD for short) "Hey, I came up with the Idea so I get to name it, Haa!  You <br/>
will not place these in other Letterbox BUT beside the letterbox in it's own <br/>
little home. (Unless you set it next to a micro box and it's a Big home with <br/>
a round black dog house in the back yard) ( Hey Dog Scouts, Made you smile <br/>
with that one!) Funny, Dog House, You know, like Dog in Dog Scouts,  House, <br/>
Dogs, Okay, Not that Funny...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, That's my Story and I'm Sticking to it  :O)<br/>
<br/>
  Hope to see everyone their!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well folks,<br/>
&gt;We're not too far away from the date of the Ohio gathering!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;PLEASE LET ME KNOW (OFF LIST) IF YOU WILL BE ATTENDING<br/>
&gt;***Note***I'll send the detailed directions to the meeting spot (&amp; any<br/>
&gt;updates) to only those who say they are attending, so that the list is not<br/>
&gt;'clogged'.<br/>
&gt;  DogScouts@hotmail.com<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When: Sunday June 15th.<br/>
&gt;Time: I'll be there very early to reserve us a spot<br/>
&gt;Where: Just West of Cincinnati in Miami Whitewater Forest.<br/>
&gt;     (Let me know if you need directions)<br/>
&gt;Who: All are invited! (Dogs and 2 legged kids too)<br/>
&gt;Cost: There is a $1 day fee or $3 yearly fee for the park pass<br/>
&gt;What to bring: Yourself, friends/family, your letterboxing gear, log books<br/>
&gt;(past &amp; present), bug spray, drinks (no alcohol allowed in the park), food<br/>
&gt;for yourself or to share.<br/>
&gt;Event Stamp: I've carved an event stamp, but if anyone else would like to<br/>
&gt;carve one also, feel free! The more the merrier!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This will be a laid back gathering. No set schedule. We hope to meet, eat<br/>
&gt;and do exchanges before noon and then spend the afternoon letterboxing.<br/>
&gt;There are several boxes already placed within walking distance of the <br/>
&gt;picnic<br/>
&gt;area I plan to nab and more a short drive away (within the park). The Sith<br/>
&gt;Impossible game will be the day before &amp; there is camping available in the<br/>
&gt;park (call (513) 367-9632 for reservations). If you plan to camp- <br/>
&gt;definitely<br/>
&gt;get reservations because there is a big dog show going on in the park that<br/>
&gt;day too &amp; the camp ground could fill up. There are 46 sites with 30amp <br/>
&gt;elec.<br/>
&gt;If anyone has any talents they would like to share (log book making,<br/>
&gt;carving, stamp protector making <franz hint="">, etc.) Let me know.<br/>
&gt;I hope to see you there!<br/>
