LETTERBOX<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = 
"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p align="center"><span>Liverpool (Onondaga County), New York<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span><span>          
</span></span><span> </span>“Please pass the 
salt.”<span>  </span>Often as not when we make 
that request we give little thought to the white seasoning that has long been 
known to man and fills that saltshaker on our dinner table.</p>
<p><span> </span>First mentioned in a 2700 B.C. Chinese 
treatise on pharmacology, salt has been the subject of poetry, fables and 
folklores; a medium of trade; the basis for tax revenue; a building material; a 
source of military significance; a description of character; a locator of place 
names; in religious use; a preservative; an essential of life, and on, and on, 
and on. In addition to seasoning our food, salt seasons our language: with a 
grain of salt; salt of the earth; pillar of salt; tears of salt, salty language; 
a salty character, a nickname for Syracuse, NY (Salt City).<span>  </span>Without a doubt, salt is the spice of 
life!</p>
<p><span>            
</span>Native Americans knew of the Onondaga County salt springs and avoided 
them because of their bitter taste, but it was not until 1654 that the Europeans 
became aware of the springs following an account rendered by Father Simon 
LeMoyne after visiting the Onondaga people.<span>  </span>It was during the tenure of the Jesuit 
priests at the Sainte Marie mission that the Native Americans, under the 
tutelage of the Jesuits, learned how to produce and use salt. </p>
<p><span>            
</span>During the late 1700s, Revolutionary War veterans settled in the area 
and, assisted by the people of the Onondaga, began commercial production of 
salt.<span>  </span>In 1788<span>  </span>the Salt Springs Reservation, on land 
surrounding Onondaga Lake, was set aside by the state of New York for the people 
of New York.<span>  </span>It is reported that in 
1790 over 600 bushels of salt were produced, and<span>  </span>in 1797, 1  million pounds of salt had 
been produced.<span>  </span>In 1856 Stephen Van 
Alstine built ‘Salt Block 56,’ later lost to Sampson Jaqueth via a default on 
the mortgage, and it is around the remaining chimney of Salt Block 56 that the 
Salt Museum has been constructed.</p>

</span>Since this is a county park, letterboxers are asked to be discreet by not 
disturbing other visitors to the park or revealing the nature of their 
activity.<span>  </span>It is also requested that 
when you have completed your quest you return the letterbox to its hidden site 
to the best of your ability. Prior to your search you <b>must</b> notify the 
attendant that you are a letterboxer, and to show your appreciation to the 
county park system it is suggested you stipulate ‘letterboxer’ after your name 
when you sign the guest book.</p>
<p> <span>    
 </span>I wish to express my appreciation to Valerie Jackson Bell, Museum 
Curator, for her assistance.</p>
<p>     This letterbox is #5 placed by “St. 
George.”</p></div></body></html>
