FisH Although my situation is unique, many students face the question <br/>
of whether to live in the dormitory or to commute to school from <br/>
home.   Sometimes I miss parts of the college experience, I am not <br/>
sure if living in the dormitory is the missing piece. Rather, each <br/>
student must make the most of the experience that he or she has at <br/>
college.  There is a place for everyone if they look for it and <br/>
become active. Becoming active in the Dairy club, the Block and <br/>
Bridle club, and the honors agricultural fraternity Alpha Zeta has <br/>
all helped me find my place at the University of Connecticut.  Living <br/>
at home has given me the benefit of staying close to my family and <br/>
our farm, but also receiving a great education.  I recommend that <br/>
people do whatever possible to attend college, just make the best of <br/>
your situation.o Fish, Fuzzy Wuzzy, <br/>
