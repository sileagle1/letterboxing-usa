or Peace mystery box.  The setting was very appropriate and beautiful <br/>
on a summer evening with the sun down low for dramatic lighting.<br/>
<br/>
Once I had guessed the general location it didn't take me long to <br/>
confirm some of the clues before we set out.  Once there the clues <br/>
were fun to follow.<br/>
<br/>
We were the first finders, somehow beating Mary from Virginia who is <br/>
usually just before us everywhere.  :-)  As the first finders Acorn <br/>
chose peace over war but Cozy decided we should takes pictures and <br/>
leave the first finders prizes for others to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
When I replaced the box I covered it a little with leaves and such <br/>
for fear of it being discovered by fireworks partyers tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Knit-wit-Mom for the fun boxing evening, the art, and the <br/>
very nice stamp.<br/>
