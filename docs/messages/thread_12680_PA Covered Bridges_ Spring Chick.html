                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not sure where it went wrong...  The clues definitely match one <br/>
of the bridges, quite straightforward, not tricky.  I suppose it is <br/>
possible the 'no parking' sign could have been taken down, but the <br/>
purple martin house and the split rail fence looked quite permanent.  <br/>
It was found as recently as 3/30/03 by the Harshbarger Bunch...  no <br/>
mention of landmarks not matching or changing.<br/>
<br/>
I am a little confused by your mention of seven bridges.  I know the <br/>
driving tour directions specify seven, but if I recall at least one <br/>
of those no longer was there (actually I think two)...  Did you do <br/>
the right tour?  There are several, but only one begins in Reamstown.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what your schedule is like, but if you have time to go <br/>
back to the area, I can tell you which bridge it is at (since you <br/>
technically did the driving part already).  E-mail me off list if you <br/>
would like.<br/>

Alas, I flew back to CA today so I'm going to have to leave your box for <br/>
another trip. . .I'll tell you the saga. . .<br/>
<br/>
We had a lot of driving to do last Sunday and didn't really want to spend 3 <br/>
hours looking for this box so, clever as we thought we were, we started with <br/>
bridge #3 and I'm thinking Bad JuJu got us for cheating.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up doing the whole thing and having a wonderful time ("Oh, let's <br/>
just do one more") but it sure would have been cool to get the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Next time, I guess.                     (BTW--how do I contact you<br/>
                                                off this site?)<br/>
