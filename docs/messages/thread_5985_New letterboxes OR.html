                    <div class="plaintext-content">On July 3, 2002 Funhog placed two letterboxes at Smith Rock State Park near<br/>
Terrebonne, Jefferson County, Oregon. Volcanic action and water erosion<br/>
joined forces to create spectacular multi-hued rock formations in this<br/>
breathtaking park. The sheer cliffs and ledges attract rock climbers from<br/>
all over the globe and are perfect sites for eagles to build their<br/>
gargantuan nests. In season, lovely wildflowers can be found along the<br/>
trails. Come in early June to see nesting,eagles and early July for<br/>
Mariposa Lilies.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: The small town of Terrebonne is located between Redmond<br/>
and Madras on Highway 97. There are signs here to direct you east to the<br/>
park entrance. You will find vending machines where you can purchase your<br/>
day use pass. Binoculars will be a big help in locating box #1 and water is<br/>
essential when hiking to box #2. You should be able to find both of these<br/>
boxes in a couple of hours.<br/>
<br/>
To letterbox #1, The Golden Eagle: Park at the very end of the road, at the<br/>
viewpoint turnaround. Find the interpretive sign about nesting eagles and<br/>
head down the short gravel path to the cliff rim overlooking the Crooked<br/>
River Canyon. Nearby, find a rocky bowl where you can stand on a carpet of<br/>
juniper needles about 6 feet back from the cliff edge. There are eagles'<br/>
nests on the rock face across the canyon at 345 and 315 degrees magnetic<br/>
and the turn of a switchback trail at 65 degrees. A pair of junipers about<br/>
six feet apart are at your back and the letterbox is at your ankles.<br/>
<br/>
To letterbox #2, The Mariposa Lily: Park at the picnic area where you can<br/>
usually pick up a trail map. Head down the trail and cross the footbridge<br/>
over the Crooked River. There is a trail map posted here. Go left towards<br/>
Monkey Face, keeping on the Riverside Trail until you spy the simian<br/>
monolith. Soon you will meet a ponderous pair of Siamese twins on the left<br/>
side of the trail. Keep walking until you meet their solo brother standing<br/>
right in the middle of the path. Walk 60 more steps to the beginning of a<br/>
small retaining wall where the letterbox lives about 5 feet before a<br/>
juniper tree. If you feel like you want a serious aerobic workout, and have<br/>
plenty of water, you can complete a loop back to your car by continuing on<br/>
to the right fork in the trail which takes you up, over the top of Misery<br/>
Ridge. Otherwise, double back and enjoy the scenery in reverse.<br/>
