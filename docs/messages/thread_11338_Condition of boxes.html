                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went to Timberland North today, found all 6 boxes which were in good<br/>
shape except Kissing Rock. It was wet inside but everything was o.k. so<br/>
after drying it out, I put in all new baggies and moved it a few inches<br/>
closer to one of the boulders on a little higher ground. It had been<br/>
sitting in a puddle of water. After that I went to Bittner Park. The West<br/>
River was raging, in fact I had to wade to get to one of the bridges. The<br/>
Playground box was very wet and the log book cover was saturated. I dried<br/>
everything, put in new baggies and wrapped Kleenex around the log book<br/>
cover hoping to absorb some of it.<br/>
