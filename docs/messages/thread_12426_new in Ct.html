Where : Hadlyme<br/>
Name, Soaring Above the Falls<br/>
Planted on April 29 , 2003<br/>

Rated, you choose ~~ easy or super great !<br/>
<br/>
                          SOARING  ABOVE the  FALLS<br/>
<br/>
High above the falls, the soaring hawk rests.  Your quest to find him <br/>
may take you on a<br/>
most wonderful hike over ridge walks and spectacular rock formations.  <br/>
Or : if you so<br/>
choose, a short hike over the falls and up to his resting spot.<br/>
 He soars above the Matabesett Trail in the Seven Falls section.<br/>
To enjoy  a great hike to find him , print off the Drew Clans clues for <br/>
Seven Falls<br/>
beginning in Hadlyme and park on Freeman road.  It is a hike you will <br/>
remember.<br/>
If you choose  to take the short route and then miss the Mattabesett <br/>
showing off its proud<br/>
trail, [and the other letterboxes planted by the Drew Clan ] then, park <br/>
on the Middletown<br/>
/Hadlyme boarder on Rte 154 aka old rt. 9A at the Road Side Park  just <br/>
where the<br/>
beautiful Bible Brook cascades into the seven falls ,south of Freeman Road..<br/>
Either way, you will climb from the falls , now on the Blue Dot blaze . <br/>
Up ,  you go,<br/>
passing a glacier erratic on your right, then up up and  the trail <br/>
twists to the right   Just<br/>
before the power lines, stop.  Look left, off trail for a large lumpy <br/>
boulder, larger than a<br/>
dishwasher. It is looking at you.  The Soaring Hawk letterbox is resting <br/>
there. Look under<br/>
the smaller rock lying east of Lumpy<br/>
Stamp in and look up, you may see him soaring.  If you have chosen the <br/>
wonderful Seven<br/>
Falls Hike of the Drew Clan, just continue on the blue dot  trail , if <br/>
you chose to miss the<br/>
cliffs and take the short hike,  just return down the trail to your car.  <br/>
Have a wonderful day.<br/>
