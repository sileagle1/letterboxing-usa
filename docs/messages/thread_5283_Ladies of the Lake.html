Yahoo has a files section<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/files/<br/>
where anyone can upload files, pictures, etc. (in fact, a set of <br/>
pictures is there already--but upside down!)<br/>
<br/>
There is supposed to be a setting where non-Yahoo members can access <br/>
the files (up to the list moderator/owner to make that choice) but I <br/>
am not sure how it works.  Anyway, all Yahoo! members could open a <br/>
file at the above URL.<br/>

Found your letterboxes in Southern Nevada--thanks for placing them; <br/>
it was fun--and you must be something of a mystic.<br/>
<br/>
Since the one box was in a populated area, I assumed there was no <br/>
need for secrecy.  My friend was a little more aware and while I was <br/>
tripping back and forth to the box, he was watching to see how much <br/>
interest my actions generated amongst the locals.  He was totally <br/>
amazed to see none.  In fact, everyone was staring at the same <br/>
location in the sky 180 degrees from the box.<br/>
<br/>
Turned out there was a California condor circling up there.  It flew <br/>
away immediately after we replaced the contents.<br/>
<br/>
We were the first to find that one and the second (and third) to find <br/>
the other one.  Sad to say, the drought this year may put an end to <br/>
your marker.  The cactus looked pretty dead and no rain in sight.  We <br/>
discovered an interesting 4-wheel trail to explore, so that was a <br/>
great find for us also.<br/>
<br/>
We will be checking out the Mid Hills box soon and, hopefully, get to <br/>
Moab before the NPS discovers that one!  What a great hobby.<br/>
