<br/>
Kewl!  I was assigned the Lion's Den box that had been listed as <br/>
abandoned.  I'm excited!  Now I just need to know what I should do... <br/>
I will be visiting the box VERY soon, so as yet I do not know what is <br/>
there.  Do I replace it with my own box?  Do I just add my stamp <br/>
inside the box?  How does this work exactly?  What do I do to make <br/>
it "mine"?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for not asking about this sooner, but I didn't receive any <br/>
notice that it had been assigned to me.  I just happened to be <br/>
looking through the NJ clues and noticed that my name is on it <br/>
now.  :O)<br/>
<br/>
This is my first "venture" with letterboxing and I can't wait to get <br/>
down there and show my kids!  I've been so excited to do this with <br/>
them, but I want to do it right.<br/>
<br/>
We will also soon be placing boxes, as soon as we get stamps made.  I <br/>
think for now I'll take the Lion's Den one, and make a box for each <br/>
of my kids.  Then we'll go on from there.<br/>

Whoo Hoo!!<br/>

The boxes that I have adopted are left as they originally were, all I am doing is providing maintenance. First I go and find them to see if they are still alive. If they are, then I get an impression of the stamp for future reference, and I restock all the materials.  Then I just sit and maintain it. if it should go missing, then I will recarve the original stamp and replace it.  If, however, the box has gone missing before I am able to get it, then I try to get in touch with someone who found it before it disappeared and first verify that I am in fact looking in the right spot for it, and if I am and it is in fact missing, then I see if I can get a copy of the stamp to recarve.<br/>

<br/>
Congratulations on your new adopted "baby."  I would agree with what <br/>
Steve said as far as what to do with an adopted box.  Just check it <br/>
out and see if it needs anything.  If so, fix it up; if not, just <br/>
keep and eye on it now and then.<br/>
<br/>
The Cape May Zoo box has a fantastic stamp in it!  My friend, <br/>
PrincessCharming, and I were the first finders last fall and the <br/>
placers did a wonderful job carving so I hope that it is safe and <br/>
sound.  If you have any problems finding it, feel free to drop me an <br/>
e-mail as I can kind of picture where it was.<br/>
