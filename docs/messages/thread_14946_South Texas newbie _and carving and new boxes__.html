                    <div class="plaintext-content">Baby Bear, Thanks for the welcome! We really do need more <br/>
letterboxers in Texas. Hopefully more will join soon. <br/>
<br/>
I have been carving stamps like mad lately. And although my first <br/>
ones were shockingly bad, I am happy to say I am improving rapidly. <br/>
Still nothing too fancy, but they are easily recognizable now. ;) <br/>
LOL! I had used only the Speedball handle and gouges at first, but <br/>
found out that it is much easier and quicker for me, personally, to <br/>
carve stamps with an exacto knife, then add details with the <br/>
Speedball. That's when my carving took a huge turn for the better! :)<br/>
<br/>
I have already planted two boxes, and have quite a few more ready to <br/>
plant. I am waiting to post them to the Clue board, though, until I <br/>
have them all (or almost all) in place. These boxes are pretty far <br/>
from any others or from any special trails or anything, so I felt <br/>
like it should be a situation where anyone letterboxing would <br/>
probably be able to get quite a few in the same day.<br/>
<br/>
I greatly enjoyed my first find too, and am planning to go <br/>
letterboxing again very soon. I am trying to wait until my <br/>
granddaughter returns from summer visits, so she can go too. My <br/>
grandson went with me the first time, and he loves it. The nearest <br/>
boxes to us are about an hour's drive in various directions. I <br/>
noticed that one of them we are planning to find was planted by <br/>
you. :) <br/>
<br/>
Well, time to move on. Again, thanks for the welcome. <br/>
<br/>
Busy Bee<br/>
