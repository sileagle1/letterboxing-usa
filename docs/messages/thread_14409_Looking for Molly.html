<br/>
7/28/03: Left my temporary home; arrived Barre, VT.  Wow!  A motel with A/C.  I thought St. George said we were tenting!<br/>
7/29/03: Crossed in to Quebec, Canada.  St. George hid me in the back of the car since I had no license or proof of shots!  Arrived 4 PM at Montmagny, Quebec on the southern shore of the St. Lawrence River.  Aha!  now I see the tent.  Am sharing it with St. George.<br/>
7/30/03: Another night in the tent!  At Mont St. Pierre on the Gaspe Peninsula in the foothills of the Chic Chocs.<br/>
8/1/03: A long day - 475 miles to Jacques Cartier Park on the western end of Prince Edward Island (PEI).  I slept most of the way!<br/>
8/02/03: O'Leary Potato Letterbox found at O'Leary, PEI.  (Letterbox stamp in HH log).  Thank God St. George didn't leave me here.  It's too far from CT and no one has been here in a year's time.<br/>
8/03/03: Cavendish Letterbox, Cavendish, PEI.  (Letterbox stamp in HH log).  St George told me to get in the car cuz I'm still too far away from CT.  I kind of like her way of thinking!  One thing I'll say - the mosquitoes are fierce on PEI.<br/>
8/04/03: Greenwich Letterbox, PEI National Park (Letterbox stamp in HH log). First to visit since August 14, 2002.  St. George decided to not leave me here.  Winters are long.<br/>
8/05/03: Today we went back to Greenwich, the PEI National Park where archaeologists have found evidence of Aboriginal people living in the St. Peters Bay area as far back as 10,000 years.  St. George liked this quote from one of the brochures:  "From a traditional Aboriginal perspective the relationship between people and places is conceived fundamentally in spiritual rather than material terms.  The Earth is a sacred place.  People are part of the living landscape, one spirit among many."<br/>
8/06/03: Kinkora Letterbox, Kinkora, PEI (Letterbox stamp in HH log).  Kinkora Country Inn was once the home of M. J. McIvor, potato king of PEI.  Broke camp at Campbell's Cove in the pouring rain.  A dry place tonight!<br/>
8/07/03: Let PEI at 8:15 AM. Arrived Augusta, Maine at 4 PM.  Trip odometer says 2700 miles since leaving my temporary home.  Still with St. George, but I fear tonight is my last night with her.  I'm going to miss her.<br/>
8/08/03: 10 AM - entered witch country; 1 PM - St. George told me goodbye and dropped me off close to home with childhood friend, Peter.<br/>
                                                                                        Ginger<br/>
