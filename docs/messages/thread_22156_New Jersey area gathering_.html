<br/>
There are several gatherings coming up, none in NJ that I know of, but two real close to each other in Sept. One in VA and one in PA. So...go to both! I know I am! Letterboxingbee did a great gathering in S. NJ last year at Palmyra Cove, haven't heard from her much this year. So anyway, two coming up in Sept. that I know of that I consider local. There is one in NY in July. Go to Silent Doug's website www.letterboxing.info and he lists them all there, regardless of what area of the country. Maybe you could shoot for later in the year if you wanted to host one? Whatever works for you! <br/>

Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I have not been on this list for a REALLY long time, but in the past <br/>
few days I started getting digests to it again, so I am catching up <br/>
fast! I have been letterboxing since 2002, usually collecting boxes <br/>
when I travels for other reasons. One thing I have not done at all in <br/>
my three years of letterboxing though is to come to a gathering or LB <br/>
event of any kind. I read in log books and now on here of people having <br/>
so much fun at these, and I would like to check one out sooner rather <br/>
than later. I mean really, for as long as I have been letterboxing an X <br/>
count of X3 is really sad (especially when one is from your mother)! I <br/>
live in central Jersey. So my question is whether anyone knows of <br/>
anything in the area in the works or even if someone is interested in <br/>
putting something together in the area (I'd be willing to help out, <br/>
though I don't know much about how to put a letterboxing gathering <br/>
together). Thanks in advance for your responses and happy hunting!<br/>
