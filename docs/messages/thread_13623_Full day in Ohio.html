We found in Miami Whitewater:<br/>

Happy Dog #1#2 #3<br/>
Bonus Box<br/>

Then went to Winton Woods for:<br/>

King Fisher Trail box<br/>
KQII - ants have made a nest in this Geocache/letterbox!<br/>
Thunder Bird - Good thing it was before the trail went down hill! The trail<br/>
ended in a lake at that point! The tree it is in is covered with HUGE poison<br/>
ivy vines. I've never seen them so large (about 4" in diameter!). Several of<br/>
the trees in that area have big vines on them. Some are poison ivy &amp; others<br/>
are not. Needs more log book pages - I added a few.<br/>
Wings of Peace<br/>
Great Oak<br/>
Hammel Pond #2 (see below)<br/>
Four!<br/>
Lost Fisher - needs more log book pages! I added a few. The hill was really<br/>
slippery!<br/>
Harrison Library<br/>
<br/>
We could NOT find:<br/>
<br/>
Once Upon a Pond - we think we had the right trees (It was hard to tell),<br/>
but didn't find any box near any of the big trees in that area.<br/>
<br/>
Blue Willow - The Map Sign Post had been broken off at ground level and<br/>
there was no box at any of the posts<br/>
<br/>
Hammel Pond #1 was under several feet of water (If it was to the left of the<br/>
sign as you were facing the sign). The water was almost all the way up to<br/>
that sign! HPII was also right at the waterline (which had receded), but it<br/>
was safe. We could not cross the bridge due to the high water, but we<br/>
managed to get around the pond on the loop trail right before the bridge.<br/>
