<br/>
I just went through four personal log books and five filled letterbox <br/>
log books looking for this image (just in case it wasn't actually a <br/>
letterbox, but a hitchhiker or an exchange) and I didn't find <br/>
*anything* that remotely looks like it.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I couldn't help you!<br/>
