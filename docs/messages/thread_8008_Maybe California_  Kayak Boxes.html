Tinman " box in Long Beach is only reachable by kayak at high tide in<br/>
Alamitos Bay." Parsons Landing" box near Two Harbors in Catalina is also a<br/>
kayak reachable box.We also have two boxes on the Rogue river in Oregon that<br/>
can be reached by river kayak . Ron is absolutely right some of the most<br/>
pristine sea kayaking is at our Channel Islands<br/>
