                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was another gorgeous day yesterday, and I decided to combine a <br/>
hike up Mt. Cardigan with a search for Danielle's Welton Falls <br/>
letterbox. Her clues begin on the east side of the mountain, whereas <br/>
I live to the west. Rather than spend an extra hour driving way <br/>
around to the other side, I decided I would just hike up and over.<br/>
<br/>
It's a pretty quick hike up from the west, and I was enjoying the <br/>
summit, with about 30 other people, by 10:30. But it was another two <br/>
hours back down before I reached Welton Falls. What a beautiful spot <br/>
you picked, Danielle! I searched for about 1 1/2 hours, with no luck, <br/>
I'm afraid. Then the time constraint began to make itself felt, as I <br/>
thought of the three hour hike back, my already tired state, and my <br/>
rash promise to provide my family with a cook-out that night. (Oh no <br/>
you don't! You're not going off letterboxing again, you grass-combing <br/>
bugger, God damn your eyes!) sigh.<br/>
<br/>
I did make it back, barely in time, but I was dragging. It was a <br/>
lovely day: I heard hermit thrushes, saw a black bear, and felt <br/>
well exercised. But next time I go to Welton Falls, I'll take the <br/>
short way.<br/>
