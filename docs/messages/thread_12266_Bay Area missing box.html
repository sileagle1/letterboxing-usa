EBP's Dry Creek Regional Park today.<br/>
A lot of folks have stamp into the logs. Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
For the Meyer's Ranch series the box by the tractor is missing the <br/>
stamp. I will be replacing it in the next week or so.  <br/>
<br/>
I also noticed that the tractor had been moved a couple of feet.  <br/>
Two of the East Bay Park service folks discovered the box, and they <br/>
logged into the logbook. I am assuming that they moved the tractor <br/>
and found the box, then they were kind enough to place the box next <br/>
to the tractor. Thank you!<br/>
