Come to think of it, that might not be so tongue-in-cheek :)<br/>

&gt; Hello all. I am a journalist in Meriden, CT and I am looking for a <br/>
few <br/>
&gt; people from the towns listed in the subject to interview for a <br/>
story I <br/>
&gt; am writing on letterboxing. I figure I may as well write about <br/>
&gt; something I like to do and it is an opportunity to spread the hobby <br/>
&gt; even more. I know I learned about it from a newspaper article a <br/>
long <br/>
&gt; time ago.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If there is anyone out there who would be willing to chat with me <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; letterboxing who is from those areas I would appreciate it. Thank <br/>
you.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">what an interesting debate this is. so many mixed feelings, pros, cons,<br/>
facts and opinions. <br/>
<br/>
smithsonian magazine, the publication that started letterboxing in the<br/>
united states. and just how many years ago was that? time magazine, how many<br/>
years ago was that? <br/>
<br/>
perhaps not so long ago in terms of years, a long time ago in terms of the<br/>
need for publicity. <br/>
<br/>
is not the need for publicity over? why does anyone feel a need to tell the<br/>
masses about letterboxing? secrecy, stealth, the joy of discovery. let those<br/>
that will be attracted discover letterboxing, or let letterboxing discover<br/>
them! <br/>
<br/>
the information is already out there, in various forms of print, on the web,<br/>
and in various parks and organized group activities. we spoonfeed the masses<br/>
and then wonder why the masses want to be spoonfed. <br/>
<br/>
yes, i am protective over who i share this wonderful hobby with. well, it is<br/>
more like obsession, but that is a different story. the same way i am<br/>
protective over anything that i consider special and full of wonderment. i<br/>
am selfish, i want my children and grandchildren to experience the wonder of<br/>
nature, the joy of discovery, the art of creating. i do not want a future<br/>
with a disney style letterboxing theme park. therefore, i believe in the<br/>
secret nature of letterboxing. secret does not equal mass publicity no<br/>
matter which way you look at it. well, with maybe the exception of that idea<br/>
on writing the article in cryptic form.<br/>
<br/>
i am now rambling so will go to bed. <br/>
