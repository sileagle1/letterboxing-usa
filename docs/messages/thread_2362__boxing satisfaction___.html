letterboxing adventure with my good friends, Floater,Floating Feather and my <br/>
side kick Lockmaster<br/>
Headed out to the "Hawk Mountain Sanctuary" in Eastern PA. to hunt down <br/>
Space Traveler's Hawk Mt. Letterbox.This was no "drive by" <br/>
box!!!(personally, I enjoy a good drive by...)<br/>
This is a box I highly recommend! Lot's of rock scrambling with several <br/>
fantastic views! A couple back tracking the trail we were on made mention of <br/>
seeing a "BIG BLACK BEAR!" at the entrance of the Yellow trail,with eyes as <br/>
large as saucers they went by us in a flash and we headed in the direction <br/>
of their retreat with great anticipation !! Rats! It wasn't our day, we <br/>
missed the bear but found the box.Hooray!! Wonderful location,beautiful <br/>
stamp,great day...I love 'boxing!<br/>
<br/>
See Joy<br/>
