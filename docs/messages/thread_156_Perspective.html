proliferation of letterboxing news throughout many circles of<br/>
people whether we know them or not and whether they have a<br/>
genuine interest in the hobby or not.  We would not only <br/>

not they were predisposed to this or had any interest.<br/>
<br/>
Extreme #2 - The clandestine operation<br/>
<br/>
With this you would require people to be on the inside for <br/>
clues information.  You would probably NOT post them in the<br/>
public domain.  People would have to contact us directly,<br/>
perhaps swear to an oath of secrecy, etc.  It would evolve<br/>
into a small, exclusive group.  You'd have little or no<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I think the middle ground is precisely where our vision is:<br/>

hand we do not have commercialism or rampant (overly-energetic)<br/>
promotion of the hobby.  This is a real good place to be I think.<br/>
And I think it is where we were bound to end up in order to make<br/>
a success of this, while keeping it open and inclusive by (wisely)<br/>
using the inernet and the free e-mail list.<br/>
<br/>
But more importantly we have people of character here.  We're <br/>
getting to know each other.  That will go a long way I think.<br/>
Its a testimony to the ability (even of the internet) to accomodate<br/>

First let me offer my sympathy to you, Julie, on your vandalized <br/>
boxes. I do urge you not to lose heart, and to keep carving. You may <br/>
find it easier, at the present time, to move on to new boxes, rather <br/>
than recarving the old stamps. I don't know. But I am sure we will <br/>
all be thinking about ways to avoid having our boxes simply stumbled <br/>
upon.<br/>
<br/>
I thought Adrian's comments on 'plugging' were fascinating. The boxes <br/>
I've hidden and found to date have all been concealed under stones. <br/>
Hiding them under earth definitely adds a new level of difficulty <br/>
for both the clue writer and the solver. Real buried treasure now. I <br/>
love it. But I don't think we _have_ to do this in order to keep our <br/>
boxes from being found accidentally.<br/>
<br/>
IMO, Dan is certainly right when he states that our present <br/>
course steers between the extremes of rampant promotion and <br/>
clandestine operation. As several others have said, I think it <br/>
extremely unlikely that Julie's boxes were deliberately sought out <br/>
and vandalized by someone who found the clues on the Internet.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that your cyber-vandals are the virus-writers who <br/>
enjoy proving their potency and cleverness without having to get off <br/>
their butts.  I don't see them tramping around the moor (or the <br/>
urban park), compass in one hand, trowel in the other. The enjoyment <br/>
of encoding and decoding is there in both the hacker and the <br/>
letterboxer, but I think there are important differences in their <br/>
mentalities.<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine that a box might be sought out and vandalized <br/>
deliberately by someone local who knew and had a serious grudge <br/>
against the hider, but not by anyone else. Far more likely that the <br/>
box was found accidentally. We just have to work at ways of hiding <br/>
them better - which is what we should all be doing anyway. Those <br/>
discussions on our list have been the most interesting to me all <br/>
along.<br/>
<br/>
The clues, like the boxes, are really out of our hands once they have <br/>
been given to anyone - list member, password-holder, trusted friend, <br/>
whomever. We can slow down the rate at which they proliferate - and <br/>
we may want to do that, for a variety of reasons, at some point in <br/>
the future. But ultimately, we can't control their spread. We <br/>
have to trust in the basic good will of people in general (and <br/>
of we letterboxing types in particular!)<br/>
<br/>
There is no fail-safe security system. The more we might concentrate <br/>
on computerized protection schemes, the more attractive we would <br/>
become to the dreaded cyber-stalker. But, as I say, I don't really <br/>
believe in that bogyman in our case. The persons we need to guard <br/>
against are those who stumble upon our boxes in or near the path, not <br/>
on the web. <br/>
<br/>
Best to all,<br/>
<br/>

<div>Hi All</div>
<div>        I 
might be wrong here, but it seems to me that your boxes are in mostly very 
public areas. Dartmoor although public has very few visitors except for a few 
well know areas. As boxers we tend to put ours away from these 
areas.</div>
<div>Plugging a box is now one of the most common 
ways of hiding a box over here. </div>
<div>This consists of making a hole in the ground 
(normally a bank) the size of the box by cutting a hole out of the grass 
(keeping this part) putting the box in and then covering with the turf. I took a 
friend to cranmere last Sunday and I told them there was a box by a lone rock, 
They could not find it and were amazed when I pulled up the turf. </div>
<div>If you cut your turf deep enough the grass will 
stay alive.</div>
<div>Summary</div>
<div>I think you need to get your boxes of the beaten 
track a bit.</div>
<div>Adrian</div>
<div>Hoping not to be taken the wrong 
way.</div>
<div>P.S I have an idea who is going to get out the 
first State Box. I.E the letterbox of Vermont. Just a copy of the state emblem. 
Is Dan keeping numbers for the boxes in the order they go out. May not seem 
important now but it will be i assure you it will be.</div>
<div>Who had the first box was it Eric\Susan.Should 
it be box No. ONE</div>
<div>Could then have your first series. The State Box 
of Vermont, Texas,Alaska etc etc----- Original Message -----

&gt; This is a thought that came to me after watching the last couple<br/>
&gt;  day's posts:  It seems to me there are two extremes to avoid.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Extreme #1 - Rampant promotion of the hobby....<br/>
&gt;  Extreme #2 - The clandestine operation....<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Where is the middle ground?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I think the middle ground is precisely where our vision is:<br/>
&gt;  We have an open group with an open philosophy.  On the other<br/>
&gt;  hand we do not have commercialism or rampant promotion....<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  But more importantly we have people of character here....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In other words, what we have here are LETTERBOXERS.<br/>
People of distinction and character.<br/>
People with manners.  People with a sense of adventure.<br/>
People with imagination; with respect for tradition...<br/>
and for nature.<br/>
<br/>
These are the kinds of people who will seek out this hobby.<br/>
That's why we all click so well.  Despite our different back-<br/>
grounds, we all share similar qualities which have drawn us<br/>
to Letterboxing.  I get the impression that this holds true in<br/>
the UK, as well.<br/>
<br/>
I think we can relax and go about our business knowing that<br/>
most of our potential foes would find our hobby too boring to<br/>
even bother with.  As long as we don't sensationalize our hobby<br/>
and try to 'sell' it to the mainstream public, most ne'r-do-wells<br/>
will not even notice that we exist.  Our openly shared maps<br/>
and clues will be effectively hidden in the vastness of cyberspace<br/>
just as our letterboxes are hidden in the vastness of nature.<br/>
<br/>
There will continue to be random acts of destruction that we must<br/>
accept as part of the game.  But these will be isolated incidents.<br/>
We can't let them discourage us.  By far, most of our letterboxes<br/>
will be successful.  So says my crystal ball.<br/>

I thought these comments of Mitch's were pithy and bore repeating.<br/>
