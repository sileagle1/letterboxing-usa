<br/>
     I have come across the CT Forestry website, <br/>
http://www.dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/letterbox.htm, <br/>
which features their new CT Forestry Letterboxes that the rangers <br/>
have planted as part of their Centennial Celebration of the State <br/>
Park System. There are presently 13 letterboxes in as many state <br/>
parks, with a total of 30 scheduled to be planted by year's end - <br/>
which will be one in each of the 30 CT state parks. This is one of <br/>
their methods of celebrating their centennial and encouraging <br/>
awareness and visits to the State's parks system. <br/>
<br/>
     Once you have completed at least 5 of these boxes, you email <br/>
them via a link on the above website with your name, address and <br/>
description of your letterboxing stamp. They will verify your 5 <br/>
visits [which must be completed by the end of 2003] and mail you a <br/>
custon-designed special CT State Forests Centennial Patch. How cool <br/>
is that - a reward for letterboxing!!!<br/>
