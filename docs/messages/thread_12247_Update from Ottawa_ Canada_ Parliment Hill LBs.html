<br/>
The area is under construction and my friends and I were unable to find the start of the clues for the 3 box set on Parliment Hill - however after much walking and some great luck found the match for the 3rd box in that set.  <br/>
<br/>
We found the third box (GREAT hiding spot!) and the first box (we rehid better than we found it, it was partially exposed), but not the 2nd box.  I am not willing to say that the second was MIA, because we were out of time and I wasn't able to focus my full attention on a careful search for it.<br/>
<br/>
We also did not have time for searching out the "10 bucks" box - maybe next trip.<br/>
<br/>
We also found the bonus left by Legerdemaine (spelling?)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the Secret Gardeners and the Canadian Goose (and Legerdemaine) for a fun adventure!<br/>
