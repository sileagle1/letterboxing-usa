Maybe a limit for Connecticut, but remember the rest of the states are<br/>
relatively barren!<br/>
Kind of like living in NY City and wishing that all the people would<br/>
go away. Enjoy what you have even if it is getting crowded. It has<br/>
allowed you to do this hobby without ever leaving your hometown area!<br/>
If I don't "P" then there are no "F's".<br/>

&gt; My "better half" keeps me in check by not allowing me to over due my<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So maybe there is the perfect Letterbox ratio.   P" to F's  , 1:10,<br/>
1:20 <br/>
&gt;  Reading the posts suggests that  there may be too many LB's out<br/>
there to<br/>
&gt; be  maintained properly and may be there should be someway to limit the<br/>
&gt; time of a letterbox to a particular spot. Like an Experation date!  <br/>
&gt; Exclude the spot and retire it to LB Heaven....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This will push some buttons I'm sure. Maybe someone can put some<br/>
light on<br/>
