<br/>
Just an update on the NW Letterboxing Summit held this weekend at the<br/>
Tualatin Hills Nature Park.<br/>
<br/>
It was great!  Thom Cheney did an excellent job of having<br/>
scratch-foam-ready-to-create stamps and rubber toys as incentives.  At<br/>
one point there were 12 groups out on the trail and more waiting for ink<br/>
pads to return.  What a hit.  I think we got some converts! <br/>
<br/>
Der Mad Stamper showed up and we had a grand time at the booth carving<br/>
and explaining how this hobby goes.  There were lots of interested<br/>
people.  We met Gary Brown who has checked out the web site and was<br/>
raring to go at the Nature Park.  He's a Volkswalker and now he's a<br/>
Letterboxer, too!  <br/>
<br/>
All in all I think everyone had a pretty good time, despite some wet<br/>
weather.  Thanks Thom for being so organized and making this thing such<br/>
a blast for all.  Thanks Der Mad Stamper for your help, support and<br/>
tips!  The event stamp was of Mt. Hood with the LBNA logo below it.<br/>
Maybe we can get together and do something in the summer.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

Just wanted to say thanks to Amanda, John and Mitch for toughing it out with<br/>
me!  We were all overwhelmed at the response we got!  The Nature Park was<br/>
pretty busy &amp; several times the 4 of us were simultaneously explaining<br/>
letterboxing to different groups or individuals.  It was a great surprise to<br/>
meet Gary &amp; learn that he knew of us before the event.  I also met a guy<br/>
named Ryan.  He has also been "lurking" on the l-box list and had been out<br/>
during the week to get 16 of the 18 letterboxes at the Park!<br/>
<br/>
One lady waited a half hour to get a stamp pad.  She was there with a 4-5 yr<br/>
old and a very young baby in a sling carrier.  She hit the trail &amp; I thought<br/>
she would return shortly with a token stamp.  As we packed up later, she<br/>
STILL had not returned.  I waited for quite awhile because I had loaned out<br/>
ALL of my stamp pads &amp; was hoping to get some of them back!  As I was<br/>
finally leaving, she comes dripping into the Park Center.  She and BOTH kids<br/>
were SOAKED but Glowing!  They had gotten many of the boxes.  Great<br/>
dedication!  It's funny how some people "get it" &amp; some just don't!<br/>
<br/>
Amanda carved a GREAT event stamp and it was pretty cool to stamp up and<br/>
exchange our personal stamps.  Our location at the event was a LOT more<br/>
public than I envisioned, but the Park Ranger wanted us front and center.  I<br/>
didn't get the time to observe Mitch's letter carving technique, nor to hunt<br/>
the 10 boxes that Amanda placed.  I also forgot to bring my camera to record<br/>
the event!!<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is ALIVE in Oregon!!<br/>

Yep, that would be me.  Guilty as charged.  =)  However, it seems <br/>
there was an event stamp which I also missed out on.  O'ell....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all of you folks who've hidden letterboxes for me to <br/>
find.  (So far, that includes Mitch, Thom, and Amanda.)  Eventually <br/>
I'll get a couple out there for you to try.  After all, it's probably <br/>
not much fun trying to find letterboxes you've hid yourselves!  =)<br/>
<br/>
I've got all of Amanda's Rick's Farm series stamps on one page of my <br/>
notebook.  Very nice looking collection of animals you've got there.  <br/>
However, my favorite part were the names each of them had.  Very <br/>
cute.  =)<br/>

<br/>
Glad to have you on board the Pacific NW Letterboxing Express!!!  I'm<br/>
glad you nabbed all of Rick's Farm.  Good for you.  If you want to get<br/>
someone else's besides Thom's, Mitch's and Mine try for Cara and Kevin's<br/>
boxes at Neahkahnie Mountain at Oswald West State Park on the coast or<br/>
they also have one at Oxbow Park in Gresham.  I've got Neahkahnie, but<br/>
haven't been out to Oxbow yet.  <br/>
<br/>
We're looking forward to the first letterbox you plant.  SPECIAL<br/>
REQUEST:  Hey...can you make it an easy one?  Mitch has been planting<br/>
too many "challenging" ones lately and puzzles drive me bonkers.  HA!<br/>
HA!  I've got to get back to the Nature Park and get Thom's other four<br/>
to add to my collection.  YIPPEE!!!  I'm sure glad we had this summit.<br/>
Hopefully, this will get more people involved.  Thanks!<br/>
