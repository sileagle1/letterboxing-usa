all. (grin).  I'm not saying I wish I was a Raven, just that I needed a symbol for the "Darkwings" and Rayvenhaus <br/>
sounds a lot better than Crowhaus!  And infinitely better than raven hoos (soft smiles).<br/>

only a 401(k) but, your own choice of a spot in the woods to go poop in.  Cause we all know only Bears poop in the <br/>
woods.  Also, if you are a Bear, who is caloric challenged, with an attitude AND you are honeyless (We are talking the <br/>
product created by bees and not as in lacking a partner, that is a different demographic and not within the scope of <br/>
this program) you are eligible, with the HFP (Honey First Program) for one full pot of honey every week.  This is not <br/>
to be confused with the BIC program (Bears, Insects and Coyotes), which provides one roadkill carcass each week to the <br/>
recipients.<br/>

&gt; I am the overweight bear with an attitude problem.  Does this zoo <br/>
&gt; offer 401K?  And are lemurs allowed?<br/>
