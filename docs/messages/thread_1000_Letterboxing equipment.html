<div>When my family and I located Squirrels "Glad" 
boxes, in Wheaton, MD we had to pour off rain water sitting on the lid, yet 
everything inside was dry because of the zip lock bags. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I bought two boxes from Food Lion, generic 6" 
x 6" x 3"  plastic storage containers. I think they were a $1 each. I used 
one to place my NC beach box last week but found I had a bit of a hard time 
fitting the log book, so next time I will look for a rectangular shaped box of 
similar size. I am a ham radio operator and a bit of a scrounge and pack rat. 
(Just ask my wife) I came across 4, discarded, 6x9x4 inch, water resistant, 
electronic equipment, storage and shipping cases just waiting for a good home. 
Well, I just found a good use for them.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When I bought my 6" x 9" Strathmore sketch book 
(100 pages of 60 lb un-ruled paper) to make it my personal log book, I also 
bought 2, Strathmore 3.5 x 5" 400 series sketch pads. (I think under 2$ each) 
They have 100 sheets of 60 lb unruled paper. By clipping and removing the 
metal binder, I split each into 3 separate pads of 33 pages each. I figure that 
is more then enough pages to start. I then made my own covers and backing and 
used light colored nylon string to "bind" the pad back together again. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I guess my biggest challenge has been the 
stamps. I have picked up some Speed-ball equipment that has made everything much 
easier. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>One more time on "Used" food 
containers.  Does anyone have experience with used food containers? 
Some Qt and Gallon, plastic, ice cream containers have a very deep, snap-on lid. 
I just wonder if the food smell would be still there after a few runs through 
the dishwasher???</div>

<div>P.S. diabolical minds do think alike.... look for 
some highway rest stop boxes from me very soon....</div>

<div>OOOOh..... I am having so much fun with another new 
hobby.</div></body></html>
