Funny you should ask I just found the perfect picture to carve into a <br/>
stamp and plan on planting it on June 17.  I am also trying to figure <br/>
out how to keep it in place; due to the rising river water a box <br/>
could just float away.  Once I can be sure they won't float away in <br/>
the rising water I'm sure I'll place more.  Living in Louisiana I am <br/>
totaly surrounded by water (when we have enough rain).  Check the box <br/>
placed in Alabama it was placed on a river accessable by tube.<br/>
I hear the rain.....<br/>

Carolyn and her gang may have hidden one somewhere on the water recently<br/>

<br/>
    There are five Lake Champlain letterboxes that are accessible only<br/>
by water.  Two are on the New York side at Valcour Island and were<br/>
placed in 1998 by Erik &amp; myself.  We placed another on the Vermont side<br/>
at Butler Island during the same cruise (sailboat).  In 2000 two more<br/>
boxes were placed on the Vermont side at Knight Island and Woods Island<br/>
by someone else.<br/>
<br/>
    Lake Champlain is a sizable piece of water with some memorable<br/>
storms, one night we took two hour watches to keep an eye out on the<br/>
dragging anchors.  This was in August.  Best of luck.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Susan<br/>

&gt; Has anybody ever tried setting a letterbox that can only be reached by<br/>

<br/>
Indeed I have.  I bet you cannot guess which one :-)<br/>

=====================================================================<br/>
<br/>
As for the other topic of the day,  I had decided this morning to <br/>
steer clear of it, despite my strong feelings as a former webmaster. <br/>
<br/>
However, I've been asked off-list to talk about it.  No matter what <br/>
I do, don't do, say, or don't say, let it pass, how I say it, etc., <br/>
someone, perhaps an old or new friend or potential friend or the <br/>
list, will be unhappy about my actions.  I doubt anyone on the planet <br/>
will be happy with them.  I doubt I will be.<br/>
<br/>
I do feel that funding a non-profit letterboxing website, as well as <br/>
discussing free (or commercial) alternatives that may exist, as well<br/>
as "secret society" issues w.r.t. to the webmasters, are on-topic for <br/>
this list (and should not precipitate rancor), but that most of the <br/>
list does not care, so I've collected my thoughts at the following url. <br/>
http://www.pil.net/~malenkai/lmri.txt (warning, it is long, and boring,<br/>
and not meant for most).<br/>
<br/>
Please don't flame me on-list for what I feel are honest thoughts -- <br/>
I don't have it in me to deal with it.  As far as further debate on<br/>
my thoughts or others on this topic, feel free to post them on-list or <br/>
off, but try to be sensitive to the wishes of the majority of the <br/>
subscribers whilst weighing the long-term importance of your comments<br/>
to the enjoyment of the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
That is to say, they are important issues and should not be stifled,<br/>
but 95% of the list don't want to deal with it, so be sensitive.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Randy<br/>

Why don't you try an ammo box that's weighted down.  They're <br/>
waterproof and sturdy.  Just don't plant it near a military <br/>
installation.  They might think it's ordinance.<br/>
