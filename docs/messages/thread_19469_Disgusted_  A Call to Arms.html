This tuppermonger really gets around...  just this past weekend I <br/>
found one of my boxes snugly in its hiding spot, covered well, <br/>
completely empty.  No trace of logbook or stamp.  I asked myself the <br/>
same questions -- who? why? would somebody do that?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a very tidy critter?<br/>

Each there own horror stories! I wish I had found this many before <br/>
encountering the habits of some little box eating monsters. We <br/>
recently went for the MD-Arbologoy boxes. Absololutely the perfect <br/>
boxing experience for us. A team of two parents, a 12 yr old boy, and <br/>
11 month baby girl in a stroller, with only limited time for easy <br/>
strolls and nice hikes and more love for the wildnerness than time to <br/>
enjoy. Very beautiful set of woods, wild and some old growth. We <br/>
decided it was our favorite boxing site so far in our limited exp. <br/>
(We are only P2 F6 X4) The 1st two boxes in the series had been very <br/>
obviously vandalized. No box and water strewn bits of journal down <br/>
the trail. #2 missing and simlar journal treatment, though this time <br/>
we found the Stamp! We walked another 1/2 mile, peeling bits of <br/>
journal pages off the paved trail, looking for stamp images. Couldn't <br/>
help our selves saving the bits with partly patterns on them. I <br/>
figure we will paste them into our journal. Last box was right where <br/>
it was supposed to be, hidden a little harder than the other two. The <br/>
team called me in to find it. I noticed that the 1st box was in a <br/>
spot sometimes known to men as "Standing Room Only". That is, a good <br/>
spot to take a pee. Little trail to a creek edge and overhang. Box <br/>
location right next to it. I noticed some beer bottles right there. <br/>
(NOTE to lady box placers: Consider if your location, just behind a <br/>
tree for instance, might stand a chance of being a place of relief <br/>
for a Man. Dirty creatures aren't we!)I guess the clues for the 2nd <br/>
box were in the 1st, and they were too lazy to find the 3rd. Oh well. <br/>
I consider this as much a part of the hobby as finding them. <br/>
Certainly not the best part, however, the best part for us is the <br/>
visiting areas we haven't been before. We will return again and again <br/>
to this park, and thank the placer for takeing us there. <br/>
