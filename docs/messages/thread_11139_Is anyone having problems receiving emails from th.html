I have a Yahoo account, and had the same trouble a week ago or so. <br/>
But I do not get the posts emailed to me anymore, I read them online. <br/>
But I do know that my yahoo account and everything with Yahoo was <br/>
running very slow this morning. I wonder if the problem is with Yahoo <br/>
and not you.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, Thank you for giving me hope for the Bull Run Library <br/>
boxes. They are next on my list of searches. :) <br/>

<div>I think it is Hotmail that is having issues with 
Yahoo! Groups.  Someone on another group was complaining about the same 
thing.  She also had her posts showing up 2-3 times even though she only 
sent them once.</div>
