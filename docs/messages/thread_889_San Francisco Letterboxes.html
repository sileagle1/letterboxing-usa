	I remember when the 90's seemed "just pleasantly warm to me".  Just keep in<br/>
mind the AZ 	state motto "But it's a dry heat" ;)  I cant blame your for<br/>
heading to SF.  <br/>
Next boxes I plant in AZ will be in the north around the Mogollon rim.  I<br/>
would love it if you found your way to planting some other AZ boxes (desert or mountain)<br/>
