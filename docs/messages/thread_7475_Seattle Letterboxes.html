                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you are going from Seattle to Vancouver via I-5,<br/>
you'll be passing through Bellingham about twenty<br/>
miles south of the border.  There is a series of<br/>
letter boxes in Larabee Park, over on the water.  I<br/>
haven't looked for them yet, but know the park well<br/>
enough to think they should be easy to find.  There<br/>
are two more nearby, but the Fragrance Lake box<br/>
involves several miles of a stiff climb up a trail.<br/>
<br/>
As for Vancouver, last Sunday we found eight boxes<br/>
[two series] in Derby Reach, a large park somewhat to<br/>
the east of the city.  Lots of walking, but it's<br/>
mostly flat and the park is both lovely and<br/>
historically interesting.  The clues are on the<br/>
letterboxing Canada site.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting.<br/>

&gt; involves several miles of a stiff climb up a trail.<br/>
<br/>
It's all a matter of perspective.  I'd say it was a few miles of a <br/>
slight climb.  =)  If you want a stiff climb, I can show you some <br/>
stiff climbs!  But Fragrance Lake isn't one of them.  =)<br/>
<br/>
I might also point out that the Seattle area seems to have a large <br/>
percentage of pretty ugly looking stamps, and if you decide to go <br/>
out to hunt them down to make a distinction between "quality" <br/>
versus "quantity".  Decide which class of stamps you want to nab <br/>
and focus on those.  <br/>
<br/>
As for quality, there's a Cougar series at Discovery Park with <br/>
absolutely GORGIOUS stamps, although one was missing <br/>
when I looked for them.  (I've heard that it's since been replaced, <br/>
though.)  The Snoqualmie Falls series is also famous in the <br/>
area for the incredible artwork.<br/>
<br/>
The Washington Wolf Mystery box, Briddle Trails, and Lost Loons <br/>
letteerboxes are store-bought stamps, if that makes a difference.  <br/>
(Although Wolf Mystery is so quick to pick up, it's almost a crime <br/>
not to--even if it's midnight while you're driving by the area!)<br/>
<br/>
The First Annual Thankgiving letterbox has a wonderful carving.<br/>
<br/>
The Halloween series is simple, but the stamps are adorable.  <br/>
=)  The Lynn Canyon boxes (disclaimer: I hid one of them) near <br/>
Vancouver are especially good stamps too.<br/>
<br/>
The Point Defiance Sports series is pretty simple too, but I love <br/>
the carvings.  The characters depicted on them are just too <br/>
darned cute.  =)  I especially liked the clues to boot.  Very <br/>
different, and a nice change from the usual "take 385 steps and <br/>
look behind tree" kind of clues.<br/>
<br/>
I've heard rumors about a lot of new great stamp carvers <br/>
inhabiting the Seattle area since I last past through (about six <br/>
months ago), so there might be more worth adding to the list.  My <br/>
list is certainly not complete, but they're boxes I've nabbed which <br/>
I thought were especially well-carved.  That, and since "quality" is <br/>
subjunctive, I'm sure there are plenty of people who'd look at the <br/>
same stamps and say, "That's crap!"  (Or vice-versa, where I <br/>
think it's lousy but others think it's wonderful.)<br/>
<br/>
If you'd rather go for quantity than quality, then just look at the <br/>
number in the series and off you go.  Point Defiance seems to <br/>
be littered with tons of boxes from several series!<br/>

     If you want a neat history lesson during your hunt, look for <br/>
the DuPont series of letterboxes.  The start point is about 1/8 mile <br/>
off of I-5 Exit 119 (just 14 miles North of Olympia or 14 miles <br/>
South of Tacoma) and will lead you through the historic area of <br/>
DuPont and the original site of Fort Nisqually (which is pretty <br/>
important in Pacific Northwest history).  The clues are pretty <br/>
simple and the trail is perfect if you have small children traveling <br/>
with you.  It doesn't require a WHOLE lot of time to find these <br/>
three boxes, either and is a good opportunity for a rest break <br/>
during a long day of traveling.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your trip!<br/>

I'm new to the sport/hobby - I'm certainly no artist.  To think that my<br/>
letterboxes are somehow less desirable because of my lack of artistic skills<br/>
is not an enjoyable thought.  I was under the impression that the hunt and<br/>
exploring new areas were the primary factors, and the quality of the stamp was<br/>
something that was way down on the list of "important" factors.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that's not what you were saying, and I've simply misinterpreted your<br/>
remarks.  If so, please set me straight!<br/>

&gt; I'm new to the sport/hobby - I'm certainly no artist.  To think that my<br/>
&gt; letterboxes are somehow less desirable because of my lack of artistic skills<br/>
&gt; is not an enjoyable thought.  I was under the impression that the hunt and<br/>
&gt; exploring new areas were the primary factors, and the quality of the stamp <br/>
&gt; was something that was way down on the list of "important" factors.<br/>
<br/>
There is no "primary factor".  To each his or her own.  I'm in it for the<br/>
clues, and if clues are not the primary factor of the rest of the world, so<br/>
be it -- I don't let it bother me and I continue to enjoy the aspects of the<br/>
hobby I enjoy, and ignore the rest.  I like to think that is a good attitude<br/>
in something as subjective (as opposed to subjunctive ;-)) as this ...<br/>
<br/>
I think you have to accept that all letterboxes will have a different <br/>
"desirability", for any number of factors, as some people are in it for the<br/>
stamps, hike, place, clues, jacking up the PF numbers, etc, and lets face <br/>
it, most people would enjoy a two mile hike thru breathtaking wilderness <br/>
over a 10 mile slog thru a toxic sludge dump, so to deny desirability isn't <br/>
realistic.  As the demographics of the group change, tho, the "desirability" <br/>
will change anyway, so it seems obvious, at least to me, to ignore this aspect <br/>
(and this paragraph :-)).<br/>
<br/>
My stamps are really lame.  They are worse than yours.  It doesn't bother<br/>
me, and I don't care if no one looks for them.  I put my boxes out for people<br/>
who see the hobby the way I do.  So, some people will ignore your boxes if<br/>
the stamps are lame, but that is a silly reason to not enjoy the hobby and <br/>
not to put boxes out.  BUT: even tho the world knows my stamps are lame,<br/>
lots of people still look for them.  I think what it comes down to is <br/>
people enjoy something special, be that a stamp, cool new place, etc., <br/>
but most people won't disparage stuff that doesn't measure up (and most<br/>
doesn't), SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT :-)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, there are ways to make lemonade, tho, which is what I've managed <br/>
to do in some cases.  If a stamp can't be a work of art, make it something <br/>
else of value for those with eyes to see.  Or, befriend an artist and have <br/>
them do this for you, if you are really self-conscious about it.  And, of <br/>
course, you will get better at it, if you take the time to try.  You don't <br/>
really have to be an artist, as there is plenty of quality, public domain <br/>
(or otherwise useable) art available, you just have to be somewhat handy with <br/>
a carving knife (or handy with a checkbook at a custom stamp making place, <br/>
which as I understand it, is certainly not taboo across the pond).  But this <br/>
paragraph can be ignored also.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">To clarify a few things in my post which, based on the posts here <br/>
and the e-mails I've gotten, needs some serious clarifications!<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing wrong with crappy stamps.  I've hidden them <br/>
myself--knowingly and deliberately hidden crappy stamps, and <br/>
even on my website I tell people straight up the desireability of <br/>
the stamp.  It's not so much that crappy stamps aren't worth <br/>
getting, but ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL, I'd prefer the better stamp.  <br/>
If time permits, I'd like to get all the letterboxes, though.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, on my website I try to tell people several things about the <br/>
letterbox including how difficult the clue is, how difficult the terrain <br/>
is, how good/bad the stamp is, and even describe the area a bit.  <br/>
These are all aspects that affect the desireability of a stamp.  <br/>
Most people mention stuff like how hard the trail is, but neglet to <br/>
say if the stamp is any good.  This is very important to me if time <br/>
is limited, because if I have the choice between a good stamp <br/>
and a bad one, all else being equal, I'd prefer the good one.<br/>
<br/>
The poor guy going through Seattle doesn't sound like he has <br/>
time to nab ALL the letterboxes in the area, and I wanted to point <br/>
him out to particulary noteworthy letterboxes.  All else being <br/>
equal, I figured he'd prefer the better stamps.<br/>
<br/>
And while there's a certain amount of subjectivity involved in <br/>
saying a stamp is good or not, there's a certain amount of <br/>
objectivity too.  It's like comparing Rosanne Barr with Meg Ryan.  <br/>
While *some* people might think Rosanne Barr is the hottie <br/>
between the two, there's no contest between who'll win that <br/>
beauty contest.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I never intended to imply a letterbox is only worth <br/>
acquiring only if it has a well-carved stamp.  It's the whole <br/>
package.  Different people have different preferences.  I like <br/>
clues that are interesting or witty.  I absolutely loved hunting <br/>
down the Shakespeare letterbox in Ashland despite finding <br/>
store-bought stamps in them.  The clue totally made the <br/>
experience great.  I've heard rumors that the Davis box has an <br/>
absolutely awful stamp (I can say this only because I've heard it <br/>
second-hand, and I'm not the one judging the quality), but I'm <br/>
DIEING to find the box because I've heard so much about the <br/>
"ballsy" place it was hidden.<br/>
<br/>
Living in Portland, all else being equal, I'd be more likely to nab a <br/>
box in the Columbia River Gorge than a park right next to me, <br/>
because I like the gorge better.<br/>
<br/>
All else being equal, I'd prefer fantastic stamps than cruddy <br/>
ones.  All else being equal, I'd prefer cruddy stamps to <br/>
store-bought ones.  And all else being equal, I'd prefer store <br/>
bought stamps than no letterboxes at all.<br/>
<br/>
But if time permits, I'd rather get all the letterboxes, cruddy and <br/>
store-bought stamps included.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, while I never pointed out pricisely which stamps I <br/>
thought were cruddy (while it's okay to point out particularly <br/>
well-done stamps, the opposite never seems to be the case), <br/>
many cruddy stamps do exist in the Seattle area.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone takes offense at that observation, do something <br/>
about it.  Take carving lessons, keep practicing new techniques, <br/>
ask other carvers how they did a particular stamp, etc.  Then start <br/>
hiding better ones.  There's a world of difference between the <br/>
first stamps I started to place (mediocre, at best) to the ones I <br/>
place today (some of which surprise even myself in how good <br/>
they are).  But even today I still place cruddy stamps <br/>
occasionally.  Usually it's when I carve something right at the <br/>
place I intend to hide it so I don't have time to do a careful, <br/>
well-carved stamp or am under some other time constraint.  But <br/>
I'll still hide the cruddy stamp under the protective flag that a <br/>
cruddy stamp is better than none at all.<br/>
<br/>
For me there's three parts to creating a great letterbox: The clue, <br/>
the location, and the stamp.  Any one of those can make a box <br/>
worthwhile, but the best boxes combine the best of all three.  <br/>
Everyone always seems to post the clue and location with their <br/>
clues, so I helped provide information about the stamps <br/>
themselves to help narrow down which boxes to hunt for first.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing should be fun, and I was trying to help that by <br/>
providing more information about the Seattle-area boxes.<br/>

Good points, of course, but intelligent people can disagree about the<br/>
details :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Everyone always seems to post the clue and location with their<br/>
&gt; clues, so I helped provide information about the stamps<br/>
&gt; themselves to help narrow down which boxes to hunt for first.<br/>
<br/>
I post the clues to my boxes.  The stamp, route, and location are to <br/>
be discovered along the way ...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing should be fun, and I was trying to help that by<br/>
&gt; providing more information about the Seattle-area boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Fun can also be in the thrill of discovery.  I think over-discussing<br/>
what is to be discovered (and how to discover it, viz. the incessant <br/>
chatter about how to solve clues from previous finders that we've seen on<br/>
the list lately) can ruin the fun for others.  To some extent, the<br/>
cataloging which stamps are Meg Ryans and which are Roseanne Barrs is<br/>
part of that ...<br/>
<br/>
Most people (apparently) disagree with me, and with the internetization<br/>
of the pastime, I guess this sort of spoilage is inevitable.  All I can<br/>
ask is to not do it with the boxes I've placed.  (Yes, I know I've<br/>
said this a million times, but we keep getting more newbies to say it<br/>
to ... :-))<br/>
<br/>
I guess this has strayed off the original topic :-)<br/>
<br/>
One thing that has been missed, tho, in the desirability thread, and <br/>
certainly in the altoids thread, is the appearance of these store <br/>
brand tins of "strong mints".  I assure you that if you use one of <br/>
these, rather than a bona fide altoids tin, that your box will fall <br/>
off the desirability chart :-) (tho the new circular altoids tins <br/>
may have the reverse effect ...)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And while there's a certain amount of subjectivity involved in <br/>
&gt; saying a stamp is good or not, there's a certain amount of <br/>
&gt; objectivity too.<br/>
<br/>
Its with super-human restraint that I lay off this one :-)  Such would<br/>
be too off-topic even for this list, if that were possible, (tho much<br/>
more interesting, at least to me)<br/>
<br/>

your previous post.<br/>

My main concern was, "is it the majority view of letterboxers that the<br/>
quality of the stamp is of primary, or even high importance?"  This is not<br/>
the case, as you and several others have pointed out.  So, I'll let my<br/>
carving skills improve with use, rather than take a 'crash course' in<br/>
carving! :-)<br/>
<br/>
My intent was NOT to start a flame war, so I'm hoping that those who are the<br/>

boorish postings should be.  Choose from the following:<br/>
<br/>
A - Quit while you're behind<br/>
<br/>
B - Have you reached China yet?<br/>
<br/>
C - Didn't your mother ever tell you that if you don't have anything <br/>
nice to say don't say anything at all<br/>
<br/>
D - Plead temporary insanity and apologize to the letterboxing <br/>
community of Seattle<br/>

Hi...I may be new at this...but I thought that Letterboxing was like <br/>
treasure hunting....<br/>
<br/>
You never know what the treasure is until you uncover the actual box.  <br/>
Sometimes the treasure is fantastic....sometimes not as fantastic...but it <br/>
is all treasure, nonetheless!<br/>
<br/>
And besides...treasure is in the eye of the beholder...what you may not like <br/>
about the stamp...someone else will love!  I enjoy the surprise of waiting <br/>
to see what the stamp is...store bought or hand carved...intricatlly carved <br/>
or someone's first time effort...there are no bad stamps!!!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Everyone always seems to post the clue and location with their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clues, so I helped provide information about the stamps<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves to help narrow down which boxes to hunt for first.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi...I may be new at this...but I thought that Letterboxing was <br/>
like <br/>
&gt; treasure hunting....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You never know what the treasure is until you uncover the actual <br/>
box.  <br/>
&gt; Sometimes the treasure is fantastic....sometimes not as <br/>
fantastic...but it <br/>
&gt; is all treasure, nonetheless!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And besides...treasure is in the eye of the beholder...what you may <br/>
not like <br/>
&gt; about the stamp...someone else will love!  I enjoy the surprise of <br/>
waiting <br/>
&gt; to see what the stamp is...store bought or hand <br/>
carved...intricatlly carved <br/>
&gt; or someone's first time effort...there are no bad stamps!!!<br/>

<br/>
Oh, heck.  I totally forgot about writing that part, and I'll admit to it <br/>
being not appropriate.  I said that in passing without even <br/>
considering the ramifications it would have.  It was an honest <br/>
opinion of mine, but the type of thing I know always raises <br/>
heckles and I generally try to avoid.  <br/>
<br/>
The point of my post was to point out the letterboxes I thought <br/>
were particularly good, because--and I'm faced to admit my <br/>
secret thoughts in public now--I was frankly disappointed in the <br/>
quality of the stamps I found the first time I tried finding them in <br/>
the Seattle area.  Maybe I was spoiled because there's a large <br/>
percentage of excellent stamp carvers in the Portland area and <br/>
my frame of reference is tweaked, but I was pretty bummed <br/>
about the first ten or so stamps I found in the Seattle area.  I <br/>
loved most of the hikes.  The clues weren't especially <br/>
challenging, but that didn't bother me.  But I wanted to show off <br/>
my new stamp collection after my "Seattle Tour", and the stamps <br/>
really weren't worth showing off.  Frankly, I was disappointed.  I <br/>
expected better.  Maybe it's not the polictically correct feeling to <br/>
have, but I had it.  It's true.  I'm an awful person and should be <br/>
blindfolded and shot.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't mean to let it slip out that I thought a large percentage of <br/>
stamps in the Seattle area were lousy.  I apologize the slip came <br/>
out, but it's my honest opinion.  I'm also sorry if you don't agree <br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
On a brighter note, on my second pass through Seattle, I thought <br/>
the quality of stamps has steadily been improving.  And since my <br/>
last visit six months ago, I've heard there are some fantastic new <br/>
carvers in the area who've taken up letterboxing and these are <br/>
MUST GET boxes because the stamps are so good.  I'm anxious <br/>
to get out and check some of them out.<br/>
<br/>
But the stamp is only one part of the entire letterboxing <br/>
experience, which is why I still go after boxes even if I think the <br/>
stamp is lousy.  At the end of the day, though, I still prefer to find <br/>
a stamp that I can look at for hours and think, "How did they DO <br/>
that?!  I've got to write this person and get some tips!"  The art of <br/>
carving is just as fun as the art of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
All stamps are not created equal.  Everyone, and I mean <br/>
EVERYONE, has favorite stamps.  Just like people have favorite <br/>
movies, favorite colors, favorite TV shows, favorite anything.  And <br/>
some letterboxes are more popular than others.  For those who <br/>
place letterboxes, consider the reasons for this: Location, clever <br/>
clues, many other boxes nearby, stamp quality--all of these <br/>
factors make up the desireability of a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
If you think the quality of the stamp doesn't make a difference in <br/>
whether people visit a box or not, you're wrong.  When a person <br/>
like Funhog or The Paisley Orca hides a letterbox here in the <br/>
Portland area, I immediately want to jump out and nab it.  I can't <br/>
WAIT to get my hands on it.  I'm like a trained dog.  When they <br/>
hide a box, I'm out there as soon as possible to nab it.  The Mark <br/>
and Beth team hid one of my favorite all time stamps at Rood <br/>
Creek Park, and I'm just waiting to see what they can do next.  <br/>
Mark and Beth tend to like their stamps to be a surprise for <br/>
people who find them, so I won't describe the stamp at all except <br/>
to say that it inspired me to make even better stamps.  And it <br/>
generated all sorts of new ideas for how to do that.  It helped me <br/>
to break out of the "mold" my stamps were in.  (Note to Portland <br/>
area carvers: This is not a complete list by any stretch of the <br/>
imagination of the wonderful carvers in the area--just the most <br/>
prolific ones and what I would call my favorite stamp of all time.  <br/>
Mark and Beth aren't prolific, but they are GOOD!)<br/>
<br/>
I love admiring the art of a good stamp, and it does sometimes <br/>
make a difference in what boxes I will go after.  Or if I plan to get <br/>
them all, it might make a difference in the order I try to nab them.  <br/>
And I KNOW I'm not the only person who likes a well-carved <br/>
stamp at the end of a hunt, because I do hear about about <br/>
"so-and-so" who's new and creating wonderful stamps, and <br/>
they'll tell me that I have to make a point of nabbing some of their <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
If somebody thinks they carve lousy stamps, that's okay.  Do your <br/>
best and hide them anyhow.  It will still bring fun and happiness <br/>
to many people.  But if you can carve an incredibly good stamp, it <br/>
will bring even more fun and happiness to those who find it, and <br/>
possibly bring in others who may not have otherwise have made <br/>
the time to get it in the first place.  The stamp quality alone won't <br/>
make a letterbox a ten on a scale of 1 to 10, but it'll bump the <br/>
letterbox up a couple of notches.<br/>
<br/>
On totally different note--and these are NOT my observations, but <br/>
rather what I've heard from multiple sources--letterboxes on the <br/>
east coast are less desireable (as a whole) than those on the <br/>
west coast because so many on the east coast are store bought.  <br/>
I've never found a letterbox outside of the western states of <br/>
California, Oregon, and Washington, so I have no opinion on the <br/>
matter myself.  But I've heard lots of people (okay, four or five or <br/>
so) who have visited the east coast to nab a few boxes say how <br/>
disappointed they were with all the store bought stamps.  It's a <br/>
generalization, to be sure, because I have seen wonderful <br/>
carvings returned from that area, but that's the image many <br/>
west-coasters have of east-coast letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
And if I get around to visiting the east coast, you can rest assured <br/>
I'll be polling my sources to learn which letterboxes have the best <br/>
hand-carved stamps out there.  I know I won't have time to find all <br/>
of the boxes out there, so if I'm gonna look for a box there, I want <br/>
to focus on the genuine hand-carved stamps.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I mention this is because it's another example of <br/>
why the stamps ARE important to the desireability of a letterbox.  <br/>
Anyone who hides a hand-carved stamp--even a lousy one--on <br/>
the east coast already has a leg up on the "better" letterbox from <br/>
what I hear.<br/>
<br/>
But, to get back to the original point about a large percentage of <br/>
Seattle boxes being lousy and your questions regarding such a <br/>
vague generalization:<br/>
<br/>
* It's a large percentage compared to the percentage of "lousy" <br/>
stamps in Portland.<br/>
<br/>
* Quality as defined by myself, common sense, and based on <br/>
what I hear others say.  (Not necesarily in that order.  In one <br/>
case, I even recommended a stamp as a "good" one because <br/>
so many others have said how much they liked it, even thought I <br/>
don't!)<br/>
<br/>
* I never wanted to be a self-proclaimed UN-official Seattle area <br/>
Letterbox Stamp Critic, but if you start throwing that label on my <br/>
head it might go to my head.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
* I apologize to those people who are wonderful carvers in the <br/>
Seattle area that may have felt I considered their stamps cruddy <br/>
in my hasty generalization.<br/>
<br/>
* I apologize that all of my thoughts are not polictical correct.<br/>
<br/>
* I apologize that I let one of my politically incorrect thoughts slip <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
* And sheeze, lighten up.  Who cares if the stamps around <br/>
Seattle aren't as nice as the ones in Portland?  It's not a contest!<br/>

PS: For the upset person who threw me into the group of "rude <br/>
men of Tacoma", I'd like to point out that I've never lived in the <br/>
entire state of Washington much less Tacoma.  I'm technically <br/>
homeless at the moment, but I consider Portland my home and <br/>
should be properly placed in the group of "rude men of Portland, <br/>
Oregon."<br/>
<br/>
PPS:  For all the people complaining about how rude it was to <br/>
say my vague, general opinion of Seattle area stamps, I'm <br/>
amazed at how you feel it's okay to publicly attack an individual <br/>
and not feel hypocritical or ashamed of yourself.<br/>

Hey now, that's *not* my opinion.  I've never found any boxes out <br/>
east, and I'm not qualified to make such judgements.  Don't <br/>
shoot the messenger.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, east coasters, I'm just passing on information.  Interperate <br/>
and use it however you wish.  If you don't like it, stop hiding store <br/>
bought stamps.  *shrug*  It's no sweat off my back either way.  <br/>
It's not like I'll be looking for those stamps anytime soon from a <br/>
couple thousand miles away.<br/>
