                    <div class="plaintext-content">  Thanks for posting on list regarding my best stamp and l'box's <br/>
demise. I live about 1 mile from that box. The good news is that you <br/>
saved the logs and stamps. Thanks so much. <br/>
  I would like to have them. The story and stamp are very special to <br/>
the Princess and me.<br/>
