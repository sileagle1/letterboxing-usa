                    <div class="plaintext-content">We visited West Virginia at the end of June and searched for these two<br/>
letterboxes.  We quickly found the Seneca Rocks letterbox, although it<br/>
was very wet ("a swamp," as a recent LBer wrote).  So - we hope we did<br/>
not violate LBing ettiquette here - we took the stamp book back to our<br/>
cabin, dried it out and peeled the pages apart again.  The next day we<br/>
went back, dried out the box, swapped the old ziplocs for new ones,<br/>
and added a new stamp book (the old one we also returned to the<br/>
letterbox, but left a note that folks should stamp in the new book -<br/>
the old one is just too fragile now).  Hope we have improved the<br/>
situation without doing anything wrong!<br/>
<br/>
As for the Dolly Sods letterbox, despite an hour of diligent searching<br/>
we never found it.  And I checked the WV list tonight and notice that<br/>
it is no longer listed.  Anybody know what happened to it?<br/>
