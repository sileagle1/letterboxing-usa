                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone!  I just subbed yesterday evening after reading a great article in Family Fun Magazine!! <br/>
I am so thrilled to say, today we (ok, my 10 month old baby and i) found our first Lb!!  We had to pick an "easy" one because i had him in the "over the shoulder baby holder" LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I emailed the placer of this Lb via the letterbox.org website but i want to mention it here just to be sure.<br/>
It was the Father's Day Lb in Steele Creek, NC... <br/>
The container was cracked and the books (two of them) were in a plastic baggie but they were soaked to the core.  They'd never get dry in there so i did take the liberty of taking them out and putting some sheets of my book in a dry plastic  baggie to take it's place until i can get out there again with another container. Now, here's where the question comes in.. do i try to find the placer of the box and return the books, hopefully dry but still readable in some places.. they were pretty bad so i'm not saying they'd be much more than a couple of stamped images readable. or do i just dry them out and return them to the Lb??  The stamp was in good condition, but the pen didnt write.  (I will leave a pencil when i return).<br/>
<br/>
It was an exciting day even if the books were soaked.  We did look for the other one in that area but had no luck.  me thinks someone moved a pile of sand that was a marker.. LOL.  <br/>
<br/>
oh, and a little about me (us).  I'm Carol Ann   (also known as AlysonWonderland) just turned 37, married to Roger for 7 years this October.  Receptionist/Assistant/Gofer/Indentured servant at a Retirement Apartment Complex. Closet rubber stamp artist, scrapbooker and traveler (isnt Lb'ing the other perfect 'hobby' for me?)  My aforementioned Lbing "partner" today is my beautiful son, James.  ;-D (of course, i would never be biased about such a fact.) who dutifuly left his inky green thumbprint on the Lb papers too!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here i am. ;-D  any other Charlotte area Lb'ers wanna get together ?<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>

  I picked up Mr. Coffee from the "mailbox" and can either make a book for him.  Or if <br/>
  you prefer, you can mail me a book to place with the HH (please contact me off list)<br/>

  &gt; Mr. Coffee made an appearance at today's gathering in Northern California <br/>
  &gt; -- I brought him from the Barb of the Hook box in Gettysburg. I'm not sure <br/>
  &gt; who picked him up to take him to a new destination, but I think most of the <br/>
  &gt; people at the gathering will see your message here on the list and so <br/>
  &gt; hopefully they'll respond.<br/>

I am so glad you were still excited even thougth your first find was soggy.<br/>
<br/>
Usually if we find a log that is that soggy, we usually try to dry it out and <br/>
gently separate the pages from being stuck together as it dries so they don't <br/>
become one big block of paper when it's completely dry. I try to contact the <br/>
placer so I can get the log to them.<br/>
<br/>
So, to answer your question, yes, you are doing the right thing. If you don't <br/>
get a reply, you might post to the list to see if anyone is likely to meet up <br/>
with that person at all and maybe they could ferry it to them.<br/>
<br/>
Again, Welcome! If we are ever down  your way we'll be sure to look you up.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
