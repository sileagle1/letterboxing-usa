&gt; trouble than to drag <br/>
&gt; my 4 kids out in 90 degree/90 percent weather on an<br/>
&gt; iffy treasure <br/>
&gt; hunt with huge thunderboomers threatening?<br/>
&gt; Fortunately, the red caps <br/>
&gt; were at the suggested bearings and the thermocline<br/>
&gt; was marvelously <br/>
&gt; refreshing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Stan and Angus (and Murray?), that was a terrific<br/>
&gt; job! <br/>
<br/>
Only glad to give alittle back to the Drew clan for<br/>
all of thier efforts!  Yes, it is Murray, that's my<br/>
dad's nickname, we took him out for the hike of the<br/>
placement and to grab a couple of otherones, I think<br/>
we have hime hooked.  He is going to carve his own<br/>
stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I do have to <br/>
&gt; mention, though, that as a born and bred San<br/>
&gt; Franciscan, "Bear Cave" <br/>
&gt; has ***other*** furry cultural connotations that add<br/>
&gt; a pleasantly <br/>
&gt; edgy mystery to your already intriguing clues (if<br/>
&gt; you're not "in," <br/>
<br/>
That's too funny!<br/>
<br/>
And I<br/>
&gt; loved your terrific <br/>
&gt; hand-cut stamp! Do you mind if I email it to Tom to<br/>
&gt; insert into the <br/>
&gt; online clue page?<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of changing the stamp, because I was<br/>
not too sure how well the artgum would hold up to<br/>
repeated stamping.  If the general concensus is that<br/>
the original stamp should stay then I will let it be,<br/>
otherwise I already have another stamp carved up and<br/>
ready to go.  If I do not use it than it was just some<br/>
practice for future stamp carving.  If we decide to<br/>
keep it by all means go ahead and send the immage to<br/>
Tom to put it with the clue.<br/>
<br/>
Take it easy:<br/>
Stan<br/>

Hey stash,<br/>
I too carved up a new stamp for the bear cave.. I got<br/>
some of those stahdtler erasers from staples and<br/>
carved up a couple new stamps, a new one for me<br/>
too.... Oh and I was thinking of completing the "cub<br/>
scout" series.... Since we have one for bear I found a<br/>
place for bobcat, wolf and lion all in the state of<br/>
CT...now I just need one for the arrow of light......<br/>
