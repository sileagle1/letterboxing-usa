for putting on a great event - our first one!  We traveled up with <br/>
Curious Crane and Latte Man - and our day long letterboxing spree was <br/>
great! We arrived at about 9:50am and didn't leave until after 7pm!  <br/>
I think we got 20-25 stamps, if not more.  Went out and planted one <br/>
with Curious Crane and Latte Man, and came back and started <br/>
exchanging, as well as stamping into the Wandering Ghost HH, the <br/>
Witch's Broom HH, and the Girly &amp; Cromag HH.  Then we went on to the <br/>
day boxes (5), and MartianMaggot (as well as her dog Duke) met up <br/>
with us.  We also saw Solor and Binx on the trail as well.  We came <br/>
back and did a little more exchanging - then went off to find the <br/>
Flax Pond series - all First Finds!  On the second LB of the three we <br/>
picked up Harriet's HH - and on the third we met up with <br/>
MartianMaggot again.  Finally, we headed to Cliff Pond to look for <br/>
the Yurt LB and the Fly Guy at Cliff Pond LB - lucky for us, we just <br/>
missed being stuck in the dark forest during a thunderstorm!!<br/>
<br/>
All in all we had a great time - thanks again to Mary Manatee and The <br/>
Yachtsman who put on a great event - and I was glad to see so many <br/>
people there!  Hope to go to another event soon!<br/>
<br/>
