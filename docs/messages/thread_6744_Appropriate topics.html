I'm on a couple of lists that are STRICT about on-topic content ("no, <br/>
you can only discuss meade refracting telescopes with gps drive <br/>

they are BORING.<br/>

collecting 3 stamps and 1 was MY FIRST exchange!!!  Oh what a fun <br/>
sport this is.  Get execise, see beautiful sights, meet interesting <br/>
people and get on line to read WHAT WAS THAT - Grief?  <br/>
    I like to read about the red socks or where they purple?  If it <br/>
wasn't for letterboxing I probably would never have known what a <br/>
benchmark was.  I do believe this is supposed to be fun.  If I wanted <br/>
to here about rules and regulations and proper this and that, than I <br/>
would enter politics.  No, that doesn't work either!  A lot of dirt <br/>
and mudslinging there too.  <br/>
    Needless to say I LOVE THIS WEBSITE.  Letterbboxing is fun so <br/>
everyone relax and have fun.  <br/>
<br/>
    to pairomedicsandthieves:  I love your idea of certificates. <br/>
That's what makes this hunting fun.  There are alot of creative <br/>
people out there and I hope someday to get a First Certificate.<br/>

Well said.  But I do have to say...and I'm gonna get it for this...and perhaps deservedly so...I cringe when I see the Lizardbutt posts, knowing that a 5 year old isn't having the discussion, mama is.  But I do have to add...I love the nickname "Lizardbutt" I laughed when I heard how he got the name.  OK I'm done, will try and wake on the right side of the bed tomorrow.<br/>

Besides how would we get to be friends if we only talked about one <br/>
thing? If excessive mail bothers you, switch your preferences to <br/>
"digest" or "no mail" and read it from the Yahoo site.<br/>
