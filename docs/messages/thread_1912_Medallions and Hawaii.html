                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello to all!! Just wanted to put my own two cents in about the hiking staff <br/>
medallions.I would be thrilled to have one and can think of at least four <br/>
others who would too!Sounds like the set up fee could throw alittle water on <br/>
the fire but I would pay "more" to help cover that if it was a one time <br/>
cost.Also my great friend Sue Clausen, who drove Space Traveller, along with <br/>
my son and I to the Ct. gather,is in Hawaii as I type with "letterbox in <br/>
hand" to plant!! She said she packed it before her swim suit! We are very <br/>
excited and are keeping our fingers crossed that hers will be a first in <br/>
that state!!It was she who introduced me to 'boxing and I have met so many <br/>
fine folks because of her sharing her "joy" with me..Best regards to all <br/>
Happy 'Boxing!!! see joy<br/>
