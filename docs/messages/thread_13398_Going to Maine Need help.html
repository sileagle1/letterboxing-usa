       We are going to a family reunion in Jonesport, ME in July.  I remember <br/>
looking at the old LBNA website when we found out we were going and there <br/>
were many letterboxes in the Bar Harbor Area as well as  Annabelle's Walk <br/>
Letterbox- Campobello Isl.  Now on the new site I am having trouble finding boxes.  I <br/>
even thought there used to be one in Machias.  Can anyone please help me by <br/>
emailing me links or clues to any letterboxes in Down East Maine<br/>
that are no longer on the web site.  I am so bummed that I didn't save the <br/>
clues before the change over to the new site.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Christi<br/>
