Just thought we would let everyone know that, according to the surveillance <br/>
as presented on the CBS movie concerning the mole, he did exit and enter the <br/>
park the same way as indicated by the clues.  Of course, they have him <br/>
parking along the side of Creek Crossing which would never have happened.  <br/>
If he had parked there, someone would have driven around that curve and <br/>
slammed right into the car.  There is no shoulder there.  I still think it <br/>
was his car I saw in that little cul de sac when I went to walk the dog.  <br/>
Always got an eerie feeling....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we got a kick out of it.  Just goes to show that our lives are <br/>
pretty dull!!!  Guess we need to do more boxing!...  BeMa<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Hope for clear skies this weekend so we can finally plant our new box <br/>
(over three weeks and still waiting!)<br/>
