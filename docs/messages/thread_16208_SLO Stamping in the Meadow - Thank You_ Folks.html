                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am sure that JugglerMouse will add her own thanks here in a moment, <br/>
but I wanted to thank all the participants, the senders of special <br/>
stamps, the sponsors, and especially those who worked so hard to make <br/>
this seem effortless.<br/>
<br/>
First the participant list that I think may need an addition or two:<br/>
<br/>
(in alphabetic order, sorta)<br/>
Buzzard<br/>
California Bear<br/>
Double Saj &amp; Old Blue<br/>
Doubtful Katherine <br/>
Donut, Watermelon, Jelly Bean, Moody Cat, G String<br/>
Emily the Rose<br/>
The Furies (2 of the 3)<br/>
GSD (3)<br/>
Jane &amp; Simon (from San Diego  and nonboxing son)<br/>
Jiggs Clan (Pete, Erin, Erica and Sarah)<br/>
Turtle Leader, Snail Lady &amp; Lock Dude<br/>
Princess Lea (without Aunt Judy)<br/>
Maddog BMW (and company)<br/>
McKenna Sampley (and her three lovely friends)<br/>
The Metlzers - Pat and Don <br/>
The Millions (Kylie &amp; Chase &amp; Lance)<br/>
Ryan Carpenter and Amanda from Seattle (surprise guests!)<br/>
<br/>
Afterall, the whole event was about you folks having fun. Thanks for <br/>
being so discreet in your searches in such a public venue. Thanks for <br/>
bringing food and chipping in with your very gracious and unlooked <br/>
for donations. No, I do not think I will attempt to do this <br/>
professionally but your donations did help enormously! Hope you had a <br/>
good enough time to want to come back soon.<br/>
<br/>
Ryan and Amanda, what can we say that has not already been said so <br/>
many times? You got us started in letterboxing. You have planted <br/>
beautiful and infuriatingly challenging boxes. And then you fly clear <br/>
across the US to support us in our first big event. We are truly in <br/>
your debt.<br/>
<br/>
Emily Rose's event stamp is unique and beautiful. The two-sided stamp <br/>
portraying the essence of fun and the location is something the <br/>
participants will treasure forever. Thank you, too, for taking <br/>
precious time out to be at the event and to run food to Ash Raven. <br/>
Your time is greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Just Beth in Connecticut, your presidential stamps were and are <br/>
appreciated enough to make you blush. You set a high standard, lady. <br/>
And yes, I did win one cheeserace against JugglerMouse, but Turtle <br/>
Leader was the ultimate victor of the day in that dance of flame and <br/>
faux food.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Buzzard for his early check enabling us to rent the <br/>
facility. You turned out to be great company and a very fun <br/>
conversationalist. You bet, we will be coming down to plant and hunt <br/>
in the Pasadena and LA area.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Stamp Luis for donating two blocks of Master Carve and a <br/>
stamp pad for the raffle. Thanks to JugglerMouse who donated uncarved <br/>
boxes and a compass.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Lance Million for taking the group photos and bringing <br/>
Kylie and Chase to the event at the last minute. You are a good daddy <br/>
and a great friend.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to Ash Raven for carving and planting boxes, then when you <br/>
were worn out from a day at work/school for retrieving most of the <br/>
entire event boxes. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks most of all to the best partner in crime, cheeseracing, and <br/>
letterboxing a badger could have, JugglerMouse, who put up with my <br/>
worries, who carved beautiful stamps, who hid them artfully (how many <br/>
did find Rollo the Bank Vole?), who was there from the first to the <br/>
last. JugglerMouse, you are a wonder!<br/>
<br/>
Tired, knee slightly throbbing, and a little sunburned, but as the <br/>
Googled motto says: "I'm Feeling Lucky!"<br/>
