Here is a new letterbox for Northern Virginia. I have more hidden than I have written up. I'm still working on a couple others. <br/>
Enjoy,<br/>

This one is at Clark's Crossing in Vienna, Virginia<br/>

This is a great place for biking or roller blading along the trail. Or you can enjoy the meadows along the lower gravel trail. I spotted lots and lots of butterflies and wildflowers and some grasses. This area has not been disturbed much so there are lots of native plants and very few invasives. However, the letterbox is in the woods, not along the bike path where the great meadows are. I was too late in the afternoon for birding but I did see a red shoulder hawk. <br/>

Clark's Crossing can be reached from the Capital Beltway (I-495) by taking the exit for VA-123 south for almost three miles to Vienna. Watch carefully for the stop light at Beulah Road where you will turn right. Continue on Beulah Road 1.5 miles, then take a left on Clark's Crossing road. Continue for one mile to the end of the road and a small parking lot. The parking lot often fills up quickly, so you may need to park along the road in the neighborhood near the lot. There are no restroom facilities here. Pets on leashes are allowed.<br/>
