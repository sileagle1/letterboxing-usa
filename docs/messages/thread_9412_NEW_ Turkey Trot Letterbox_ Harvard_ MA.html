Each year our families gather at our home to celebrate the blessings <br/>
we have received and feast on a cornucopia of assembled offerings. <br/>
In a post-prandial haze, the gang ventures out into the cold and <br/>
typically rainy(although we did get snow yesterday) weather to walk <br/>
off the turkey-bloat and make room for the pumpkin pie.  This <br/>
letterbox, in honor of Thanksgiving 2002,has been planted as a <br/>
surprise for my family at a local conservation area where we make our <br/>
annual trek.  Perhaps we shall meet you along the route after your<br/>
own holiday indulgence. <br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
Route 495 Exit 28 (Rt. 111 heading west).  Take first left onto<br/>
Codman Hill Rd and follow it to the end.  At the stop sign turn right <br/>
onto Stow Rd.  Take first left (approx .4mi) onto Westcott Rd and <br/>
follow to the end.  (Note:  Westcott Rd. appears to fork at the top<br/>
of <br/>
the hill; veer to the left to stay on Westcott.)  At the stop sign <br/>
turn left onto East Bare Hill Rd.  Powell-Reed-Abbot Conservation<br/>
Area <br/>
(approx .6mi) is on the right side.  The trailhead is immediately <br/>
after mailbox number 117.  A wooden fence blocks an opening in the <br/>
stone wall on the side of the road.  There is no sign or  parking<br/>
area <br/>
at this trailhead; pull off to the side of the road in front of the<br/>
fence as best you can.  There are no facilities at this area.  Dogs <br/>
and horses are allowed.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
The old tom knew he was lucky to have escaped with his wattle intact. <br/>
The dog, with his two-legged companion had flushed out some of the <br/>
other turkeys nearby and the explosion of gunfire had almost startled <br/>
him from his lair.  He held his ground patiently waiting to see if<br/>
the pair was satisfied with their bag.  The big black dog lifted her <br/>
nose to the air, took several quick sniffs and with a ferocious bark, <br/>
lunged straight at the tom's hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
In a flurry of feathers the old bird leapt over the wooden fence and <br/>
took to the air for as long as he could.  He fluttered straight back <br/>
through the field, passing on his right stands of trees that the man <br/>
would cut and sell for decoration in the dead of winter.  As he <br/>
followed the curve of the path and through a screen of trees and <br/>
undergrowth he could barely see the tiny pond where he had drank <br/>
earlier that day.  The furious bark in pursuit pushed him to amazing <br/>
speed.  Darting into the wood he agilely scrambled through the stone <br/>
wall keeping it to his right as he followed the low road through some <br/>
large pines.  The turkey wished that the three-leafed plant that the <br/>
men avoided would deter his four-legged pursuer, but knew that it <br/>
wouldn't.  He ignored two trails coming in from the right knowing<br/>
they led to other dangerous man dwellings.  Breathing heavily as the <br/>
trail had become steeper, he chose to stay on the main trail when <br/>
another entered on the left..  In his haste to find a new hideout he <br/>
did not notice the small white-striped shape meandering down that<br/>
side <br/>
path.  At the fork near the top of the hill he veered right and <br/>
straight ahead saw the ancient double maple tree nestled in the<br/>
corner <br/>
of a stone wall.  He dashed right, around the pine tree with the <br/>
man-markings on it, through the stone wall and crept slowly 10 steps <br/>
back along the wall before settling in behind the stones.<br/>
<br/>
He heard a mournful yelp and soon a familiar and very potent scent <br/>
wafted through his hidden spot.  It wasn't so bad really; the <br/>
whimpering retreat more than compensated for the smell.  The old tom <br/>
was safe for now.<br/>
