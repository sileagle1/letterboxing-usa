great job!!!<br/>

Ryan, it's true most Seattle girls don't have fangs <g> and it was nice to <br/>
know you don't have little pointy horns <g>.  However, your halo did seem a <br/>
bit tarnished after the Math Letterbox incident.  ;-)  (Just teasing!!)  <br/>
Your Event Stamp / Letterbox Clue was truly inspired.  I had a great time <br/>
following an *actual* Treasure Map to the hidden Booty!!  =D<br/>
<br/>
Hoopoe, to my great pleasure, agreed to be my hiking buddy.  I really <br/>
enjoyed chatting with her.  She's simply a font of outdoor knowledge... and <br/>
even laughed at my corny jokes.  Besides, how can I not like someone who <br/>
enjoys a good shuffle thru the leaves too!<br/>
<br/>
Quentos and Jodobird (&amp; Constanza) joined us by the lake.  We had great fun <br/>
getting to know each other and scratching our heads looking for the hidden <br/>
treasure.  I was particularly taken with Constanza and kept threatening to <br/>
slip her in my pocket and take her home with me.<br/>
<br/>
Amanda and Amanda, it was great to meet you both.  I've enjoyed getting to <br/>
know each of you via Email.  It's nice to have faces for the names!<br/>
<br/>
Eliza, it was great to see you one last time before you begin your Grand <br/>
Trek south.  I'll be counting the days till your return to Seattle.<br/>
<br/>
All the kids were great.  I especially enjoyed watching them play in the <br/>
leaves.<br/>
<br/>
I still haven't stopped to count my stamps yet.  I didn't get all the stamps <br/>
that were hidden at the park, but I've already told my Mother that we have <br/>
to take a trip down there together.  She'd love it.<br/>
<br/>
Whew, well time for bed... what a weekend!<br/>

<br/>
I'd just like to clarify, it was Amanda from Seattle who ran off with <br/>
the Math letterbox, not me!  Of course, I could have stopped her, but <br/>
I was kind of fond of the idea myself.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I've uploaded the "official" event stamp to my clue <br/>
page--correct spelling and all.  The clue is at <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/WA/Treasure  (It hasn't <br/>
changed from before.)<br/>
<br/>
The stamp image itself is at <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/WA/Treasure/eventstamp2.jpg<br/>
<br/>
I'd also like to point out, if you take a REALLY close look at the <br/>
event stamp (use the second link to see it better), you can clearly <br/>
see the arrow pointing ACROSS the trail to where X marks the spot.  <br/>
While the X itself is on the wrong side of the trail, that's only <br/>
because I couldn't fit it on the correct side but the arrow does <br/>
point to where the correct location of the X is.  =)  <br/>
<br/>
Sheeze, people accusing me of making a mistake.  I *never* make <br/>
mistakes.  ;o)  (Ahem, nevermind about the fact that I did have to <br/>
carve the event stamp twice.  *coughing*)<br/>
