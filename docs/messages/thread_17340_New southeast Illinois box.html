<br/>
Albion Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Azroadie<br/>
Placement date: December 21, 2003<br/>
State:  Illinois<br/>
County:   Edwards<br/>
Nearest city:  Albion<br/>
Difficulty:   Clues &amp; walk   easy<br/>
<br/>
The box is in the Albion City Park.  From I-64 or U. S. Hwy. 50, take<br/>
State Hwy. 130 to Albion.  Go west on Main St. (St. Hwy. 15) to the<br/>
300 block and turn into the park on the south side of the street. <br/>
Park at the south end of the parking lot near the north end of the<br/>
lake.<br/>
<br/>
Walk east past north end of lake to a gravel park road. Go south on<br/>
gravel road, cross paved city street, and continue south on paved park<br/>
road.  The road will turn west at two large tires.  At the next turn<br/>
go south on a white gravel road which curves around to a small covered<br/>
picnic area.  At water faucet face east and go at about 150 degrees<br/>
for about 20 paces to two moderate size trees with rough gnarly bark<br/>
close together.  The box is between the two trees under some rocks,<br/>
twigs and leaves.<br/>
<br/>
This is a public and visible site; so, please be discreet when<br/>
retrieving and re-hiding the box.<br/>
<br/>
I will not be able to check on this box; so, please let me know if you<br/>
find it.  Also, let me know if it is missing so that I can delete the<br/>
clues:<br/>

 Looks like you were on a road trip!<br/>
