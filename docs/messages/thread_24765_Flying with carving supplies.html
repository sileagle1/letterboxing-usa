tempting the sceener to determine if they were okay or not.<br/>
It would be better to keep them in your stowed bags. There are some <br/>
prohibitions on the things you can keep in your stowed bags but pointy <br/>
things aren't on the list.<br/>
<br/>
I travel with shotguns, stowed in a locked and secured case, but if I <br/>
tried to place live ammo inside the case not in its original container <br/>
then it would be against the rules.<br/>
