<br/>
As a list owner, I know the traffic often gets heavy.... I personally was planning to e-mail the owners on Sunday, figuring they'd gotten too bogged down.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just glad to know it's being taken care of.  Now that I know things like this happen, I'll be checking the files section periodically myself.... when the kids are NOT around.<br/>
<br/>
This too shall pass...<br/>
