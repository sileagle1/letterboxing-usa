the Vt State Coin box and the Rock Climber letterboxes today. The 180 degree<br/>
clue is wrong. 180 degrees takes you over the edge. Over the edge of the<br/>
cliff that is. The stone wall is North. I looked at that cliff and said oh<br/>
no, not again. Actually it wasn't a problem. I know the area well and there<br/>
is only one wall that it could have been. Just thought I'd tell you so you<br/>
can change it. It was kind of funny though with me and cliffs. Good job with<br/>
the box. I thought your carving was fine. Actually it is a very hard subject<br/>
to carve. I would never have even tried to carve it. Very good job.....Chuck<br/>

I took the reading from the overlook looking over the cliff at the valley below. The spot you stand in would matter but the way you face wouldn't. The compass will point the same way. I remember that the reading was completely opposite and recall it being North, so that would make sense. The wall reading should be 360 degrees. I would rewrite the clues and send it in again. Title the post Atten:CT web master, revised clues. In this way he can just replace the clues instead of having to read it and look where to make word changes. Saves him work......Chuck and Molly<br/>
