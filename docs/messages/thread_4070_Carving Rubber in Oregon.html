<br/>
As for carving rubber, in the Portland area, Michael's usually has<br/>
Speedy Stamp (the pink stuff).  Art Media (downtown Portland by the<br/>
library and I think there's one in Beaverton) has some crumbly white<br/>
rubber called Nasco Saf T Kut.  I use it all the time because it holds<br/>
ink well and doesn't need to be mounted.  A lot of people don't like it<br/>
because it can be hard to do really super fine detail with it.  You can<br/>
also get Staedtler Master Carve blocks at craft stores, such as Craft<br/>
Warehouse, I think and some rubber stamp stores carry them.  I know<br/>
First Impression does.  They are a dream to carve with.  Regular white<br/>
art erasers work well, too, but you're limited to the small size they<br/>
come in.<br/>
<br/>
Some other possibilities are PZ Cut, which can be mail-ordered, and<br/>
Plumber's Gasket, which can be purchased in sheets at hardware-type<br/>
stores like Home Depot, etc.  PZ Cut is probably the easiest medium to<br/>
cut and carve with, but it doesn't hold ink well at all unless you prime<br/>
it by either sanding the surface or going over it with Scotch Brite<br/>
first.  Plumber's Gasket really needs to be sanded good to take the ink,<br/>
and it is a medium that prefers a sharp tool.  The other downfall of<br/>
these two mediums (in my opinion only, though, I'm sure) is that they<br/>
tend to be quite floppy (Speedy Stamp, as well) and make better stamps<br/>
if they are mounted.<br/>
<br/>
It is good to be a well-rounded carver and give all mediums a shot so<br/>
you can find the one you like the best and also, so that if you are in a<br/>
bind and don't have you favorite type of rubber around, you can be<br/>
versatile and carve on something else, if need be.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps you out!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

cut.  I'm wondering if I inked it first...would the contrast between the <br/>
surface and the white underneath be easier to see?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have tried several different mediums, and like the<br/>
rubber erasers for small, stuff.  For larger images,<br/>
however, I really like the plumber's gasket, but you<br/>
are right in that it really doesn't hold ink to well.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any technique I can use on an<br/>
already carved stamp to help it hold ink better.  I<br/>
would think that sanding the gasket after carving<br/>
would damage the detail on my stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
