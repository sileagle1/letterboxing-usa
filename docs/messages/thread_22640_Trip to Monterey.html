<br/>
I'm going to be attending a conference in Monterey, CA from Oct. 23-<br/>
27.  I don't know that I'll have a car (still undecided ... they won't <br/>
reimburse for that part).<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions for good boxes in the area?  Of <br/>
course ... good is subjective ;^) but I figure any box that's where <br/>
it's supposed to be, is good!<br/>
<br/>
Also, if anyone has any suggestions for seafood restaurants, I'd <br/>
LLLOOOVVVEEE to hear about those, too!!<br/>

(about 15 miles North of Monterey).  Awesome!!!  We go there EVERY <br/>
SINGLE TIME we visit!<br/>
<br/>
Lots of cool letterboxes in the area.  Not sure which ones are still <br/>
active.  We were last there in Feb 05. <br/>
