You bring up something that has been bothering me since I started letterboxing. Shortly after I joinied there was a post about ingenious places to plant and the word caves was included. As a newbie I had yet to learn "Who's who in Letterboxing" (as someone stated yesterday) and I was too intimidated to say anything. Now that I do know I don't care and I would like to speak up on this subject. But please, I do not mean to give offense or sound preachy. I humbly apologize in advance if I do.<br/>
<br/>
My first and foremost love, way before letterboxing, is caves. I am a member of the National Speleological Society which is dedicated to the preservation and exploration of caves. I am also a member of the Pennsylvania Cave Conservancy and donate regularly to the WV Cave Conservancy. Caves are incredibly dangerous places for non-cavers. When cavers explore caves they go in teams, have the proper equipment and make sure other people not on the trip know where they will be should they not return on time. They also have cave maps to navigate. Even the smallest cave can be dangerous for the reasons Anna Lisa stated below. It could be an animals home, snakes, hidden drop off, bad air, etc. Go to caves.org and read up on the NSS. Cave deaths are not uncommon. They are more common among non-cavers but even cavers have fatal accidents due to equipment failure or plain human error. Also, caves take millions of years to form and many caves are still forming. An innocent placement of a hand can<br/>
 damage a formation that took millions of years to form. Caves are often home to Bats. I am a member of BCI - Bat Conservation International. Bats are a very useful mammal in that they eat thousands of pounds of bugs a night. A nursery colony that gets disturbed can be irreparably harmed.<br/>
<br/>
When I first came to letterboxing I was really impressed by the warning on the website about being careful of delicate ecosystems and taking care of the locales where we chose to plant. I love the taglines some folks use on their emails "Letterboxers leave nothing but good impressions". The NSS motto is "Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints, kill nothing but time"<br/>
<br/>
I can't stress enough that caves are not a good place to plant, for your own safety and the safety of those hunting your box, as well as for the environment. Thanks for listening and do what your conscience tells you to do,<br/>
<br/>

OOPs, I forgot to include the moral to my story:  I'm wondering how many other boxes are in caves, and if people should think twice before placing a box in a cave.  Around here, anyway, caves are almost guaranteed to be in high demand by the animal &amp; bird population, since they are not all that common.  We may have the kind of adoptive families we hadn't planned on for some of these boxes!  Also, when I said in my former post that I'd tried to contact the placers, I mis-spoke.  I tried to email the "Stone Faces" placer and also "Rubythroat" HH's creator and heard nothing back.  Stone Faces #2 is a nice one.  I have not tried to email "Giant Peach" placer, but that box was in good shape.   --lunaryakketyact<br/>

Not all caves are created equal.  Some caves are so large they bring <br/>
people through in large tour groups.  Others are so small that you <br/>
need to wiggle through like a worm--after taking off most of your <br/>
clothes to makes sure you can fit through.  Some caves have delicate <br/>
formations, while others such as talus caves don't really have much <br/>
of anything that's delicate.<br/>
<br/>
Ape Cave--a lava tube--near Mount St. Helens probably gets a <br/>
thousand people a day going through on busy days.  It's probably the <br/>
easiest, safest 'wild' cave I've ever been in, and I think it would <br/>
be an excellent place for a box.  I did that one by myself, but it <br/>
wasn't really a big deal.  I've been on outdoor trails that were <br/>
harder and scarier than this one.<br/>
<br/>
Greenhorn cave--near Bakersfield--I wouldn't recommend anybody do <br/>
that alone nor without a helmet.  It's not *especially* dangerous--<br/>
except for perhaps the exit.  But why take the chance?  It probably <br/>
gets a few people in a week, and if the worst were to happen while <br/>
you were in it, help would be a long way off.  And there's some very <br/>
tight places where things could go wrong or hit your head.<br/>
<br/>
One cave I visited (Paradise Cave near Yosemite) hadn't had a single <br/>
person log into the logbook at the entrance for three months.  If <br/>
something bad happened in there and you couldn't get out--they'd be <br/>
finding a corpse!<br/>
<br/>
But you know, I'd still be for hiding a letterbox in the cave.  But <br/>
you have to remember who your audience is.  Especially for that last <br/>
cave--where there are delicate cave formations and gets a visitor <br/>
every few months--I'd never put it on the main letterboxing site.  <br/>
That's not who my intended audience is.  My intended audience would <br/>
be other cavers, and I'd share the clue with those people.  People I <br/>
knew would take proper safety precautions and treat the cave <br/>
formations with respect.  And in the clue, there would be a special <br/>
warning about cave dangers--just in case the clues got into the <br/>
wrong hands.<br/>
<br/>
So I hope you don't discount the idea of hiding letterboxes in caves <br/>
*completely*.  =)  They certainly do have a place in letterboxing, <br/>
but there are 'special considerations' to be made in hiding boxes in <br/>
caves.<br/>
<br/>
On an unrelated note, I still dream of hiding a letterbox a hundred <br/>
or two feet up in a tree.  I haven't figured out how to get up there <br/>
yet, but one of these days.....  However, such a box would be for <br/>
experienced tree climbers only!  =)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">"Not all caves are created equal"!!! Oh the blasphemy! Don't let the NSS hear that one!! Actually, I do agree. There are caves and then there are CAVES. That's why folks should let their conscience, and common sense guide them. But I was really serious about the dangers. There is a whole group of volunteers, the National Cave Rescue Corp, who do nothing but pull people from caves. Often locals or "flashlight" cavers who did not have a map and did not know what they were getting into. There was just a death recently of a bunch of teenagers who were partying in a cave, a local hangout that everyone knew and used all of the time, and were killed by bad air (carbon monoxide). The NSS does not get involved with the show caves, they are privately owned, nor caves in Nat' Park usuually because they are federally protected. But we raise a lot of money every year to buy and protect private caves. So just BE CAREFUL. The cave you thought you knew really well could turn out to be your last. By<br/>
 the way, since many are talking about their animal "totems" mine is a bat, well a dancing bear bat. Which combines my two great loves, the grateful dead and caving (the bat is the international symbol of the caver). Take care and as we say in the caving community "Happy Holes" or "Cave Softly"<br/>

if necessary--as long it took to get her free!  (I think he was just <br/>
trying to calm her nerves.)  He eventually found another route to <br/>
the other side of the hole and took off her pants, which was enough <br/>
to get her loose.<br/>

I descended through a corkscrew squeeze which was very tight. When it was time to ascend, gravity (and my rather larger bottom) worked against me. What I was able to squeeze together on the way down would not squeeze as well on the way up. They tried everything, even pulling on me until I thought my arms were gonna pop out of their sockets. Finally we tried one last thing before we called the NCRC (National Cave REsecue Corps). Instead of pushing up and forward facing front, I turned around on my back and and pushed up and backwards. I got to use all of my back and leg mucles and had much better purchase. I popped out like a baby being born. When I agreed to back into another cave the next day (it was a camping and caving weekend) my then boyfriends caving club declared me "a keeper". Boy the things women will do for love!<br/>

jokingly took her not to worry, they'll bring down food to feed her <br/>
if necessary--as long it took to get her free!  (I think he was just <br/>
trying to calm her nerves.)  He eventually found another route to <br/>
the other side of the hole and took off her pants, which was enough <br/>
to get her loose.<br/>

We had a lot of fun with that story after the fact, but it wasn't <br/>
funny at the time!<br/>
