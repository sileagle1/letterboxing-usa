And you thought "It's a Holiday" meant a crudely carved eraser. Meet <br/>
Sassy Val. She may not be appropriate for the kiddies.  She is the <br/>
direct descendent of last year's valentine. Very few saw that stamp <br/>
before it went missing. I doubt if anyone got the reference to the <br/>
valentine's heart's origin. <br/>
<br/>
I just had to make Sassy Val tall. Originally she was meant to bend <br/>
over to fit into the microbox (like the Queen Mary II). But Night <br/>
Owl just couldn't bare to watch me saw the lady in half. "Just make <br/>
the box bigger." Hence tall Sassy Val now lays in the <br/>
first "extended" microbox. I recommend bringing red and black <br/>
markers. Please be extra careful replacing her, centered on the <br/>
velcro so she won't fall.<br/>

P.S.  Yes, this means you've missed the Saturn V moon rocket in <br/>
three parts I had there for the Icebreaker.<br/>
