It may not be a bad idea if you are SURE that someone did something <br/>
bad.  I'm just concerned that people will get blamed for somethings <br/>
that weren't they're fault.<br/>

How do you search what boxes someone else found recently?<br/>

unless you check on the box the same day or maybe the next day there is no<br/>
way to know absolutely certain who was there last.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tammy makes an excellent point here. Many boxers don't log their finds on AQ, or are even members of the National or regional talk lists. I see so many stamps in my boxes from boxers that aren't found online anywhere. <br/>
<br/>
  Yes, there are knuckleheads out there and I get as pissed off as the next person when a box goes missing, but we use word of mouth in my area, and only if we are absolutely sure about it. I read someones post yesterday that they had just replaced a box or stamp for the 3rd time or something like that and if it goes missing again they were going to pull it and find another spot. I think that's probably the lesson to be learned there. It took me awhile to admit I had planted a box too close to a geocache and simply had to move it as I was tired of the problems.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For me, it sort of depends on the box placer.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started finding boxes, I *always* contacted the placer<br/>
afterwards to let them know I'd enjoyed finding their box, I always found<br/>
positive things to say about the search and the find.  (I've never yet<br/>
contacted a placer asking for additional clues or anything.)<br/>
<br/>
But after I began placing boxes, I noticed that many of the people finding<br/>
my boxes were the  same people who I had contacted in the past about *their*<br/>
boxes.  Had they contacted me at all after finding my boxes?<br/>
Nooooooooooooooooo.  Only maybe one or two.<br/>
<br/>
So now I'm a little more selective about how I spend my time.  If it's a new<br/>
placer whose box I find, I contact them, in hopes that it will encourage<br/>
them in boxing and encourage them to contact placers themselves for boxes<br/>
they've found (if they're not already doing so).  For more seasoned placers<br/>
out there, if they've never contacted me, then I contact them *if* I have<br/>
spare time on my hands that day.  Otherwise, I frankly don't see why I<br/>
should feel obligated if they don't feel obligated.  Why isn't my time as<br/>
valuable as theirs?  That's the way I see it.<br/>

Some people, when looking for clues use the evidence that the box is still<br/>
active. If you are searching for a box, and no one has logged it for a<br/>
year, then some people take it as evidence that it may not be there. And<br/>
then won't go look for it. I am not saying it's a correct assumption, butI<br/>
am glad when people log, even though I appreciate a note more. And<br/>
honestly, unless you find 10 boxes a day, it really takes no time at all<br/>
to do it.<br/>

Everyone who takes part in this hobby has the right to play it any way <br/>
they want to. I prefer to have the record of finds or attempts available <br/>
so boxers can decide if they want to try for the box. Others prefer to <br/>
not even have that feature activiated. I like to send a note along with <br/>

&gt; Recently we<br/>

&gt; Recently we<br/>

&gt; they<br/>

&gt; Subject: [LbNA] Bad boxer repository?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here's a thought - how about a running list of "bad letterboxers" <br/>
&gt; somewhere on file?  I went to check on my series of 8 boxes (two of<br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt; have recently gone missing) this morning, and found yet another one<br/>
&gt; missing<br/>
&gt; that had been reported found over the weekend.  <br/>
&gt; I only had time before work to check on one other, and it was not<br/>
&gt; hidden<br/>
&gt; properly.  So I'm pretty sure I know who is to blame.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm planning to contact the placers (via AQ) of the other boxes whom<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; person has visited recently (a noob visiting from the Chicago area -<br/>
&gt; only a<br/>
&gt; few finds to his/her credit) to warn them to check on their plants,<br/>
&gt; unless<br/>
&gt; they are listed as having been found after the noob's visit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone have an opinion on this?  I've already taken the "kid-<br/>
&gt; friendly" icon<br/>
&gt; off, and the "drive-by" one, and plan to re-write the clues to make<br/>
&gt; them a<br/>
&gt; little harder.  But seriously - planters get to know who is causing<br/>
&gt; problems<br/>
&gt; with their boxes; shouldn't we be able to share this info, so if we<br/>
&gt; get a "I<br/>
&gt; found your boxes" email we can say "uh-oh, better check on those".<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S.  I know, I know - I'm just irked.  The one that disappeared most<br/>
&gt; recently was my favorite!  Plus, I'd rather work on my new series<br/>
&gt; than on<br/>
&gt; re-doing this one...<br/>

top of the clues and keep it updated as to when the box was last found.<br/>
That's IF it's important to the placer that folks not reject looking for the<br/>
box because it hasn't been found lately.  And there's not just ONE site to<br/>
"log" into -- there's both LbNA and atlasquest.  Or do they combine efforts<br/>
in that department so that what's logged in on one site automatically gets<br/>
logged in on the other site if the box is listed both places?<br/>
<br/>
2.  If there are folks that won't go looking for a box because they assume<br/>
it's not there since it hasn't been "logged in" recently, then then that's<br/>
THEIR loss.  I guess, as a placer, I'm just not out to please that sort of<br/>
finder.  I actually keep the note at the top of my clues updated, if I<br/>
remember to do it, for ME, so that I know when I might need to go out and<br/>
check to see if any maintenance is needed.<br/>
<br/>
Just because somebody "logged in" to my box really would tell me little tho.<br/>
A note actually saying the box was found alive &amp; well would mean something<br/>
to me.  Trouble is, just because a person "logs in" doesn't mean the person<br/>
actually did find the box.  There are more than a few folks out there who<br/>
cheat.  :-)  Back when I WAS listing my boxes on LbNA, a lot of folks<br/>
"logged in" that had either never stamped into the box's logbook (unless<br/>
somebody around here is stealing stamp pages out of logbooks) or that had<br/>
actually found the box long ago but were just logging in recently.  And just<br/>
because someone "logs in" for a box also wouldn't tell me that they might<br/>
have left the box in bad enough shape that it'll end up missing at some<br/>
point in the very next hour.  :-) So if some potential finder is making the<br/>
assumption that because the box was recently found that it's still there and<br/>
in good shape that seems a pretty dumb assumption in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
3.  "It really takes no time at all to do it" IF that's what ya wanna do<br/>
with your time. :-)<br/>
<br/>
For example, I spend a lot of time logging books onto librarything.com<br/>
because the poverty level folks in my area who live in an unincorporated<br/>
section of the county will then be able to go online to see what they might<br/>
be able to come over and borrow from me.  They can't afford the $400 a year<br/>
charge for a library card that our town charges non-residents, so they'll go<br/>
to the library and use the library's computers to see if I have the book<br/>
they might want to read, then come over to my house.  Or, if their children<br/>
have online access at school, the children will use the school computer to<br/>
check my site.  So in MY mind, it really takes no time at all to log in a<br/>
new book on the site because that's what I WANT to do.  So even tho, to me<br/>
it takes no time at all to enter a book, I've had friends who absolutely<br/>
cannot understand why I'd spend the time to do that.  THEY'D probably rather<br/>
go to LbNA and atlasquest and log in finds. :-)  To each his/her own.<br/>

Some people, when looking for clues use the evidence that the box is still<br/>
active. If you are searching for a box, and no one has logged it for a<br/>
year, then some people take it as evidence that it may not be there. And<br/>
then won't go look for it. I am not saying it's a correct assumption, butI<br/>

&gt; &gt; I'm not quite sure I understand.  Is there some sort of "contest"<br/>
going on<br/>
&gt; &gt; as to what placer can get the most finders for their boxes or<br/>
something?<br/>
&gt; &gt; :-)  If a placer wants to merely have the date available for other<br/>
boxers<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; see the last date a box was found, all they need to do is put a<br/>
note as to<br/>
&gt; &gt; last date found at the very top of their clues and keep it<br/>
updated.  If a<br/>
&gt; &gt; finder contacts me or if I go out to check a box, I just write<br/>
something<br/>
&gt; &gt; like:  "This box was last found to be alive and well on such-&amp;-such a<br/>
&gt; &gt; date."<br/>
&gt; &gt; Or if there's been no first-finder yet that I know of, I'll say at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; beginning of the clues and give the date.  Seems easy enough to me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some people, when looking for clues use the evidence that the box is<br/>
still<br/>
&gt; active. If you are searching for a box, and no one has logged it for a<br/>
&gt; year, then some people take it as evidence that it may not be there. And<br/>
&gt; then won't go look for it. I am not saying it's a correct<br/>
assumption, butI<br/>
&gt; am glad when people log, even though I appreciate a note more. And<br/>
&gt; honestly, unless you find 10 boxes a day, it really takes no time at all<br/>
&gt; to do it.<br/>

<br/>
I'm in the same camp as DEF. <br/>
<br/>
As a hider I really appreciate a log, it lets me know there was a<br/>
visit, and it let's others know it's still there and findable.<br/>
<br/>
Logbooks go missing and get damaged by the environment. When this<br/>
happens it's nice to have an online log of visits to the box. And<br/>
online logs are an incentive - when I see there was a visit I often<br/>
head out to the box to get a look at the new stamp. Which in turn<br/>
is a good thing because I also do some maintenance while I'm there (if<br/>
it's needed).<br/>
<br/>
I especially appreciate a note from a finder, it inspires me to keep<br/>
hiding. If I never received online feedback I would take it as a sign<br/>
that my boxes don't inspire finders to contact me and say thanks for a<br/>
nice experience. When I don't get a note and then check the paper<br/>
logbook and see a stamp but no comment I wonder if it means the finder<br/>
thought the box was ho-hum, not worthy of a thank you or note. <br/>

&gt; 1.  I would say in that case that the placer should just put a <br/>
note at the<br/>
&gt; top of the clues and keep it updated as to when the box was last <br/>
found.<br/>
<br/>
We do that if there are some "attempted" listings and if the box is <br/>
in place. Thus the "attempted" listing is more of a reflection of <br/>
the letterboxers acumen than the viability of the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
We have some letterboxes that have not been found in two years, so <br/>
if letterboxers are using the logging function to try to figure out <br/>
if the box is still there.......they really don't have a clue.<br/>

&gt; 3.  "It really takes no time at all to do it" IF that's what ya wanna do<br/>
&gt; with your time. :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For example, I spend a lot of time logging books onto librarything.com<br/>
&gt; because the poverty level folks in my area who live in an unincorporated<br/>
&gt; section of the county will then be able to go online to see what<br/>
they might<br/>
&gt; be able to come over and borrow from me.  They can't afford the $400<br/>
a year<br/>
&gt; charge for a library card that our town charges non-residents, so<br/>
they'll go<br/>
&gt; to the library and use the library's computers to see if I have the book<br/>
&gt; they might want to read, then come over to my house.  Or, if their<br/>
children<br/>
&gt; have online access at school, the children will use the school<br/>
computer to<br/>
&gt; check my site.  So in MY mind, it really takes no time at all to log<br/>
in a<br/>
&gt; new book on the site because that's what I WANT to do.  So even tho,<br/>
to me<br/>
&gt; it takes no time at all to enter a book, I've had friends who absolutely<br/>
&gt; cannot understand why I'd spend the time to do that.  THEY'D<br/>
probably rather<br/>
&gt; go to LbNA and atlasquest and log in finds. :-)  To each his/her own.<br/>

Oh yes, of course I would!  That's not the point for me to either<br/>
letterboxing OR offering the library.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the library goes, I love books and I truly feel the future of this<br/>
country rests in education.  They might never say thank you until they're 90<br/>
years old and realize what a good education meant to them during their life,<br/>
and then I won't be around for them to say it to anyway.  Or they may never<br/>
ever say thank you.  I'm totally fine with that.   There are a lot of times<br/>
when I'm not even home when people drop by to get a certain book.  They'll<br/>
call me, I'll leave the book on my enclosed backporch, and when they're<br/>
finished, they'll leave the book back on the backporch with maybe a note of<br/>
what they'd like to read next.  It's worthwhile to ME to offer the service.<br/>
I don't need somebody else to validate it for me.<br/>
<br/>
With letterboxing, I place because the box I'm placing means something to me<br/>
or the site I'm placing it at means something to me or both or there was a<br/>
particular occasion or circumstance that meant something to me, or it means<br/>
something to somebody else that I'm close to (for example the idea behind my<br/>
"Reverence" box means a lot to the family I planted it for plus I thought<br/>
the windmill on the property and the history behind it was really cool) or<br/>
ALL of the above. :-) Now how's that for a run-on sentence?  Sure feedback<br/>
is nice.  Would it stop me from planting boxes if I didn't get feeback?<br/>
Not. at. all.<br/>
<br/>
My Judge Judy boxes are waiting to get planted out at N.I.U. until I have a<br/>
chance to get out to DeKalb and search for a couple of superduper sites.<br/>
It's not going to be easy -- I want the boxes to be on campus because of the<br/>
way I want to write the clues.  There will be a trick to the clues.    I<br/>
made the boxes because I love Judge Judy, because I got my undergrad degree<br/>
at N.I.U., because N.I.U. now has a law school, because I loved N.I.U.'s<br/>
library, and because DeKalb is home to my favorite kid, Gus, that I babysit<br/>
whose parents have a serious connection to N.I.U.'s library, and because I'm<br/>
going to have a lot of fun writing the clues.  Once I plant the boxes, if<br/>
nobody comes to find them or people find them but give me no feedback, I<br/>
planted them for MY reasons for planting them.  Feedback is kind of like<br/>
icing on the cake.  It's nice but it's extra calories that won't kill me if<br/>
I don't get them.<br/>

everybody shares their love of that particular aspect of LbNA or atlasquest.<br/>
So I reply as a courtesy.<br/>
<br/>
So basically you're saying that it's OK for a placer to badger (no offense<br/>
to any badgers out there) a finder to log in because it'll take the finder<br/>
less time to log in than to reply back to them, meaning there's a chance the<br/>
finder will say OK! OK! If you leave me alone I'll go log in the find?<br/>
Guess maybe I shouldn't bother taking the time to EITHER log in OR explain<br/>
myself to placers.  Yeah, that's not a bad idea......just ignore the<br/>
placer's email completely.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I keep a record of boxes I've found also, but I keep a verrry simple list<br/>
right on my own computer.  Mine isn't for counting -- it's so that I know<br/>
what page of my scrapbooks my notes are on for that box in case I need to go<br/>
back and refer to them -- but it just as easily could be for counting if I<br/>
was into counting.  There would still be absolutely no reason for me to feel<br/>
a need to do it online.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe my memory just isn't as bad as yours?  I've never had a problem<br/>
remembering how many boxes I've found.  But then I'm not a big-time finder<br/>
either.  I'd say I have a little less than 300 finds right now.  I'm sure my<br/>
memory will be able to hold at least a few more than whatever number of<br/>
boxes I find.  :-)  I'm 54, and to some folks' way of thinkin', that's<br/>
ollllld, but to me, I'm just gettin' warmed up!  My memory isn't shot YET.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of goes back to that ol' question:  If a person finds a box twice<br/>
but doesn't remember the first find, can they count it as two finds?  :-)  I<br/>
guess when I'm 55, I'll say yes yes yes!<br/>

It takes you longer to write back to them telling them you are not<br/>
going to log in your find than it would to actually log in your<br/>
find.  And as a placer, I appreciate it when people log in their<br/>
finds.  And as a finder, I log them in so that I have an accurate<br/>
list of the boxes I have found.  That way, in a couple of years, I<br/>
don't have to try to remember "did I find that one?"  I can just go<br/>
look at my list and there it is.<br/>

I am getting kind of confused here I think. Is there another place to find the clues besides on LBNA or on AQ ? <br/>
<br/>
So we all have a log in name and then look up the clues and then search out the boxes but people do not want to log in and mark the box as found? Isn't that part of it all?

  I respond back to a placer as a courtesy. I could say, I guess, that if<br/>
  they didn't waste my time by emailing to request it that I wouldn't have to<br/>
  waste my time replying to their request. :-) I could say, I guess, that if I<br/>
  didn't log in then it wouldn't be hard for a placer to figure that I'm not<br/>
  interested in logging in. I don't consider myself under any obligation to<br/>
  reply. But yes, it might not be a bad idea for placers to know that not<br/>
  everybody shares their love of that particular aspect of LbNA or atlasquest.<br/>
  So I reply as a courtesy.<br/>
<br/>
  So basically you're saying that it's OK for a placer to badger (no offense<br/>
  to any badgers out there) a finder to log in because it'll take the finder<br/>
  less time to log in than to reply back to them, meaning there's a chance the<br/>
  finder will say OK! OK! If you leave me alone I'll go log in the find?<br/>
  Guess maybe I shouldn't bother taking the time to EITHER log in OR explain<br/>
  myself to placers. Yeah, that's not a bad idea......just ignore the<br/>
  placer's email completely. :-)<br/>
<br/>
  I keep a record of boxes I've found also, but I keep a verrry simple list<br/>
  right on my own computer. Mine isn't for counting -- it's so that I know<br/>
  what page of my scrapbooks my notes are on for that box in case I need to go<br/>
  back and refer to them -- but it just as easily could be for counting if I<br/>
  was into counting. There would still be absolutely no reason for me to feel<br/>
  a need to do it online.<br/>
<br/>
  Or maybe my memory just isn't as bad as yours? I've never had a problem<br/>
  remembering how many boxes I've found. But then I'm not a big-time finder<br/>
  either. I'd say I have a little less than 300 finds right now. I'm sure my<br/>
  memory will be able to hold at least a few more than whatever number of<br/>
  boxes I find. :-) I'm 54, and to some folks' way of thinkin', that's<br/>
  ollllld, but to me, I'm just gettin' warmed up! My memory isn't shot YET.<br/>
<br/>
  This kind of goes back to that ol' question: If a person finds a box twice<br/>
  but doesn't remember the first find, can they count it as two finds? :-) I<br/>

  It takes you longer to write back to them telling them you are not<br/>
  going to log in your find than it would to actually log in your<br/>
  find. And as a placer, I appreciate it when people log in their<br/>
  finds. And as a finder, I log them in so that I have an accurate<br/>
  list of the boxes I have found. That way, in a couple of years, I<br/>
  don't have to try to remember "did I find that one?" I can just go<br/>
  look at my list and there it is.<br/>

As for the bad boxer repository [my 11 year old's vocabulary word <br/>

is causing the initial [valid] frustration.<br/>

<br/>
I think the reason most people put their boxes on online sites is so that other letterboxers can access the clues to find them. While it is true that some are also looking for feedback, that is not a fair assumption to make across the board.<br/>
<br/>
And no -- logging the box is not necessarily a part of it -- it can be, but for some people it isn't and that is their choice to make.  Although I don't feel there is any obligation whatsoever on the part of a finder to contact the placer or record a status when they find a box, I do agree that it is courtesy to thank the placer when you find their box.  I very much appreciate this and I think most people are in that camp, but logging the find is only one way to do that.  Personally I liked it much better before LbNA had the ability for people to log their finds because I received many, many personal e-mails from people telling me of their adventure.  I loved reading their comments about the way they interpretted the clues, the condition of the box or how they enjoyed the location, etc.  This is the kind of feedback I prefer, so this is the type of feedback I choose to give.  I try to contact the placer and write a short note with every box I find rather than just enter some impersonal, non-informative status into LbNA.  What they choose to do with the information after that is up to them -- use it to manually keep a status on their clues or enter a status log update themself, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I actually have the LbNA status feature turned off on my boxes because I think knowing the history of who was at the box and when detracts from the intrigue of finding the box and encourages people who are just out collecting stamps as quickly as possible.  Likewise I seldom look at the status log of a box before I seek it.  Why would I want to know if the last 3 people  to look for the box were not able to find it?  Does this mean the box is missing?  Not necessarily.  Does this mean I will not enjoy the journey to the box and the time spent deciphering the clues?  Definitely not.<br/>
<br/>
I do provide a status date on all of my clues, which I manually maintain based on seeker reports and my own visits.  If having the status logs turned off on my boxes deters people from looking for them, as Mosey said, it doesn't really bother me and they probably weren't the types of folks I want looking for my boxes in the first place.<br/>

  if someone finds a box and the next person to search for that same box cant find it, then you go to look for it and cant find it yourself, does that person who last found it get to go onto your naughty list? it seems that the naughty list you talk about is flawed.<br/>

boxer like yourself probably would get a total of 100 on both sites<br/>
after a while.  I don't think letterboxing.org has a way of restricting<br/>
clues by F-count, does it?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; if someone finds a box and the next person to search for that same<br/>
&gt; box cant find it, then you go to look for it and cant find it<br/>
&gt; yourself, does that person who last found it get to go onto your<br/>
&gt; naughty list? it seems that the naughty list you talk about is<br/>
&gt; flawed.<br/>
<br/>
That seems to be the general consensus.  Still, based on checking the<br/>
rest of the logbooks in this series, I have a strong suspicion as to<br/>
the 'culprit' in this particular case.  If it was a stand-alone box,<br/>
well then, not so much, because there would be nothing to check<br/>
against!  For me personally, if this person comes back to get the rest<br/>
of the boxes (once I replace the two that were ALREADY missing) or any<br/>
of the new series I'll be putting out soon, I will RUN to the park to<br/>
check on them upon notification of their find.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   dont forget about chip and dale! they maybe cute but they are<br/>
&gt; suspect too!<br/>
<br/>
LOL!  But they're so CUTE!!!<br/>

Hey - any word about Gingerbread Jim?<br/>
