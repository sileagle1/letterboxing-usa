"Weyanoke Sanctuary -- Nestled at the end of Gates Avenue.<br/>
The land for this bird and wildlife sanctuary was a gift of Norfolk Southern <br/>
Railroad to the Cape Henry Audubon Society."  There is a small window of <br/>
opportunity to gain access to this letterbox since this park is only open to <br/>
the public on <b>Saturdays from 9-12</b>. It's manned (&amp; womaned) by a small but <br/>
dedicated group of folks who work hard to keep it lovely. It's a magical little park.<br/>
Wander around until the following makes sense....<br/>
<br/>
Bird house, outhouse on the left.<br/>
behind a rustic bench, you'll find a cleft.<br/>
in back of a log, at the base of a tree<br/>
under pine straw hides "Weyanoke Sanctuary".<br/>
