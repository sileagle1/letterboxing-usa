Planted by Cherieph and rtrw on August 8, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Distance -  Maybe  a mile in and out<br/>
Time -  30 minutes <br/>
Difficulty - Easy.  The only tough part is knowing which trees we mean<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Brodie Park is located on the corner of West Hill and Niles Road. On <br/>
the lake side, there are 50 acres which can be used for soccer, <br/>
picnicking, swimming, boating and other<br/>
outdoor activities; across the road there are an additional 150 acres <br/>
on which you can hike on the trail set up by the Conservation <br/>
Commission, horseback ride, or take a<br/>
leisurely stroll.<br/>
