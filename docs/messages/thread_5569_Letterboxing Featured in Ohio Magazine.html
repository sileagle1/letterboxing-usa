Well...it's something of a catch-22...if there's an article about <br/>
letterboxing in a largely distributed magazine...more poeple are <br/>
going to go to the web site to see clues and we've got to figure <br/>
that, along with introducing more poeple to LBNA...it's also going to <br/>
increase chances of vandalism, complaints, and missing boxes.<br/>
Some small amount of publicity is ok.....but, in my opinion, the more <br/>
visible this sport becomes, the problems we'll have. I'm not sure if <br/>
articles like this are a boon and a bite.<br/>

Relax Campers....I did not blame the problem on you or on that <br/>
specfic article. I mearly stated an opinion that publicity is a <br/>
double edged sword....if you don't agree with me that's a pefectly <br/>
accetable resposne and this group is a good forum for stating your <br/>
veiw.<br/>
 Come out of the cave...it's a nice day.<br/>
