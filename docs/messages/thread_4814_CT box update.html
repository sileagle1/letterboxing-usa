JLR and I went hunting for a few boxes today down in CT.  The weather was <br/>
spectacular!  But we have a few missing/broken boxes to report.  We <br/>
successfuly found both Sunshine Daydream boxes.  Wonderful stamp!  The <br/>
trouble began when we started at JB Williams park, also in <br/>
Glastonbury.  When we found Santa's Playground #1, the contents were all <br/>
over the ground, and the container had lots of water in it.  The stamp pad <br/>
was leaking all over the place.  We looked and looked, but couldn't locate <br/>
the logbook.  It looked like the tree that this box might have been hidden <br/>
in got knocked apart in a recent storm.  We put everything back in the <br/>
container and left the box at the location, so the Varrell family could go <br/>
and retrieve it.  Santa #2 was alive and well.  The other box in the park, <br/>
Rennsalaer at Hartford, is also missing.  We're almost positive we were in <br/>
the right place, but there was no box to be found.  Anyone found this one <br/>
lately?<br/>
We had a good time despite this, though...it was hard not to be happy what <br/>
with the 60 degree and sunny weather!<br/>
