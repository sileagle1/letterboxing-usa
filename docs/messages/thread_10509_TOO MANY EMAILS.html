CLICK on the "EDIT MY MEMBERSHIP" link toward the top right of the <br/>
letterbox group page and scroll down to the "MESSAGE DELIVERY" <br/>
section, choose the last option "NO EMAIL-- I'll view the messages on <br/>
the list".  That should eliminate the problem---the messages don't go <br/>
to my email account, and that is how I have it set up--This is a <br/>
great list that is VERY active, I can see how it could clog up your <br/>
email!<br/>
Good luck!  Irish Mum : )<br/>
