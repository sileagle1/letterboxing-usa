So, in my "free" time I have the following updates to report:<br/>
<br/>
BIRD WALK - has had 2 more visitors. This box is in fine shape - the trail is <br/>
quite grown in. Although I have managed to trim it here and there, it's still <br/>
crowded. It's best to wear thin pants for this box - or perhaps wind pants.  A <br/>
bird watcher left a unique stamp behind - a beautiful blue jay feather! <br/>
<br/>
SECRET GARDEN- Maine Geneologist reported in as the first finder. This box <br/>
has also passed the scrutiny of the local gardening club -phew!  If you locate <br/>
this mystery box, please take a postcard to report on the current condition and <br/>
also remember to leave your personal stamp as an added treat!<br/>
<br/>
BAXTER WOODS SERIES - Meandering Mermaid reported in with all boxes <br/>
found as well as a wonderful suggestion for the Box #2 - Ash. Changes have <br/>
been made to the clue - Thank you!  <br/>
<br/>
KEY TO THE CITY - alive and well, visited by Meandering Mermaid and <br/>
several others.<br/>
<br/>
MT. A - I'm happy to report that a visitor from Tokyo, Japan has found this box! <br/>
<br/>
Finally, "HERE COME THE TICKS" Hitchhiker is still in our possession, so <br/>
please look for it at the gathering. A new log book is being created since it will <br/>
probably be full after that event!!!<br/>
<br/>
As of August 1st, Phyto &amp; Isosceles will be moving to the Bangor area, if there <br/>
are any people that would like to step up to take care of some boxes, please <br/>
email me off-list and I would be happy to discuss. We planted several boxes <br/>
down this way in the hopes of generating some interest in this part of Maine <br/>
that would translate to others by the time that we move. Hopefully it has <br/>
worked. Looking forward to the 9th gathering!<br/>
