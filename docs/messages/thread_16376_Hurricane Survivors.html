hurricane just fine.<br/>

The Music Man (one of the 4 Faces of Wickford) was totally destroyed <br/>
because the ink pad "exploded" and the last finder (letterboxer or <br/>
civilian) did not put the ziplocks on the logbook or ink pad.  <br/>
Miraculously, the stamp was still there.  I replaced the box, log <br/>
book, pen, ink pad, and put the original stamp back in there. The <br/>
original log book in on my kitchen table drying.  I have contacted <br/>
Trish already.  So if you go searching for "The Music Man", it is <br/>
still there, just repaired.<br/>
