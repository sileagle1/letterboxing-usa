Thanks, Jerry and Andy for another letterbox down south.  I was <br/>
wondering if you anticipate any confusion among boxers/cachers by <br/>
combining the two activities.  Specifically, the difference in <br/>
letterboxers exchanging stamps in logs and cachers exchanging items <br/>
from the cache.  I had a letterbox on Long Island and was puzzled to <br/>
find some odd items left by a visitor.  Later I found that the <br/>
location also had been planted with a geocache, so I'm assuming the <br/>
hunters mistook the letterbox for the cache.  It might also cause <br/>
some unwitting cacher to exchange his trinkets for a stamp.  Do you <br/>
leave behind in your letterbox/cache any clarification of the <br/>
difference?  I don't hink we can assume that all cachers/letterboxers <br/>
are familiar with the others' etiquette. <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Kathy..<br/>
Thanks for noticing a new letterbox in SC. We are in need of LB`s <br/>
this way.<br/>
I am new to LB`ing,but been geocaching a year now. I find both <br/>
fastinating.<br/>
I only have 1 find in LB`ing. We went on vacation to Myrtle Beach an <br/>
we found the Sunset LB  in Sunset Beach. I was like a kid at <br/>
Christmas.<br/>
I have planted my 1st LB at Tybee Island Georgia.(Railroad <br/>
Trail/Cache) an Yes....my stamp was taken by a cacher. I had both <br/>
sets of instructions printed an in folders,but he didn`t read them. <br/>
He liked the stamp,so he took it. I had to replace it.<br/>
I will see how long it lasts.<br/>
Hope you get this way sometime to visit. I hope to plant more LB`s <br/>
soon.<br/>
Thanks for the reply an hope you all had a Happy 4th.<br/>
Jerry<br/>
