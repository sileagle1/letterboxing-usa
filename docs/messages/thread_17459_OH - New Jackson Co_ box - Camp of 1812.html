This is the 10th box in our `Legends of Jackson County' series.<br/>
<br/>
During the War of 1812 against the British, large numbers of troops <br/>
were marshaled to meet the threat including here on the western <br/>
frontier.  (I know  it's hard to imagine Ohio being the western <br/>
frontier of the United States!)  Ohio was a key strategic area and a <br/>
military camp was established in Jackson County to recruit, train, <br/>
and make available soldiers to oppose and British or Indian <br/>
offensives in the area.  During the long, tedious encampment, many of <br/>
the men carved their initials into a large boulder at the edge of the <br/>
camp.  The area has been known as the Camp of 1812 ever since.  <br/>
Sadly, the boulder was dynamited for use for bridge abutments by the <br/>
highway department in the 1930's.  (We forget sometimes that <br/>
environmental and historical impact statements are a product of the <br/>
late 20th century!)  The only visible reminder that the Camp was here <br/>
is a sign in a yard across the road and east a couple hundred yards <br/>
from this letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
You'll have no trouble solving this cipher if you remember the name <br/>
of the general who won the Battle of New Orleans after the war was <br/>
officially over.<br/>
