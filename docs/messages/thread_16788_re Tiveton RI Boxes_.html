                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh yah, Fort Barton hike was great. We started out at around 2pm on <br/>
Sunday.  We were *way* off on our first hunt for the 1st box, that <br/>
took up some time.  Then we did find the burled tree and the <br/>
declaration of love, so up the hill we went...poking and poking with <br/>
sticks in the stone wall, and recovering with leaves ( many, many, <br/>
many layers of fallen leaves, could be why we didn't find it??), so <br/>
when we looked up, there goes the sun....down... so rest of hike was <br/>
*very brisk* walk out of darkening woods. Now we will wait until <br/>
Springtime at 10 am. :-)  But this is why we like letterboxing - at <br/>
the very least, we get a great walk in the woods!!  Thanks.<br/>

Jay, The Yachtsman and I promised to perform maintenance on that box,<br/>
but haven't gotten back there yet.  We'll do it very soon.  I'm pretty<br/>
sure it is probably still there, as long as you interpret the clues<br/>
the right way.<br/>
