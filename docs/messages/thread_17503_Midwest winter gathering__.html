I'm relatively new to letterboxing myself -- but I've personally enjoyed stamp carving and suggest you just jump in!! You may surprise yourself.<br/>

Don't be too disappointed if you don't get a lot of response about <br/>

<br/>
I must say that SpringChick is being very humble about the FABULOUS job she <br/>
did organizing the Great Lakes LB Gathering last spring!  Yes, I'm yelling, <br/>
because the gathering was sooooo much fun. :)   All of the attendees were so <br/>
kind, gracious, and talented - including the canine ones!  Despite the wet, <br/>
30-some degree weather on that last day of May, the gathering was a wonderful <br/>
success.  Carving demos, journal-making, sharing of ideas, good food, searching for <br/>
boxes, and much more.  I just can't say enough about what a positive <br/>
experience it was.  <br/>
<br/>
I would be very interested in attending a gathering, and I'm sure some of my <br/>
stamping/LBing friends would be interested, as well.  Some live in SE Mich, <br/>
some are in the Lansing area.  <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the hobby!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd like to second StampinPam's comments about the Great Lakes <br/>
Gathering last May -- and to encourage Enders Angel.<br/>
<br/>
SpringChick's incredible planning made the GL Gathering happen so <br/>
smoothly. As one who has had some experience with event planning, I <br/>
wholeheartedly agree with the comments about the thoroughness of <br/>
SpringChick's detail work. From creating an email list of interested <br/>
letterboxers in the Great Lakes region, to scouting a site, to <br/>
securing workshop leaders and planning workshops, contacting <br/>
prospective event-stamp carvers, hiding a number of event-specific <br/>
boxes.the list goes on and on.<br/>
What a great time it was! <br/>
It would be wonderful to have another gathering and see some of the <br/>
newer Michigan (and beyond) letterboxers as well as those who <br/>
attended last year.<br/>
I often look in my logbook at the stamps of people we met last spring <br/>
and review on SpringChick's website the photos of that chilly day.<br/>
<br/>
I'd enjoy meeting some of the folks whose stamps have shown up in my <br/>
west Michigan boxes.<br/>
So, Enders Angel, StampinPam, et al, go for it!<br/>
