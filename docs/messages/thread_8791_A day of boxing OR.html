Movie clue for Brett's latest creation. We did drive a wee bit slower than the breakneck speed shown in <br/>
the movie. The box has a wonderful stamp in it and the hitch hiking puppydog that was inside was grateful <br/>
for a breath of fresh air. I also got a good laugh watching Ryan as he attempted to find the Little People's <br/>
Letterbox. It was in plain sight but the fellow just couldn't see it. And I thought I had bad eyesight!? <br/>
Thanks for the good time, Funhog<br/>

Too bad you didn't get Ryan at the Little People box on video - I'm <br/>
sure lots of folks would have liked to see that!<br/>
<br/>
Make sure Ginger gets a good home!<br/>
