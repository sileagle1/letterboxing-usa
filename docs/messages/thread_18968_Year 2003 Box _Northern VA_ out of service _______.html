                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm sure I'm not the first boxer this has happened to, but I've<br/>
certainly never heard of it.  Feel free to beat me up (virtually) if I<br/>
did the wrong thing, but I couldn't think of any other solution.<br/>
<br/>
I rode my bike home from work today, and feeling insufferably healthy<br/>
and adventurous, decided to stop off to look for the two boxes in<br/>
Lacey Woods Park.  I looked for the Year 2003 box first.  As I rode<br/>
up, I noticed a pickup truck parked at the picnic pavilion with one or<br/>
two people around, but thought nothing of it.  I found the box exactly<br/>
where it was supposed to be.  It was in pretty good shape - a bit<br/>
waterlogged, but the book itself was dry.  I was the first boxer there<br/>
this spring.  I carried the box down near the road (and away from<br/>
mosquitoes - and it's only May!) to stamp in.  When I was finished, I<br/>
took the box back up the path, only to notice that three more vehicles<br/>
were now at the picnic area, and a host of people in gray uniforms<br/>
were gathered around.  Sure enough, I now saw that all the cars said<br/>
"Park Ranger" on the side.  The site of the box is in full view of the<br/>
picnic pavilion, and several of the dozen or so rangers were watching<br/>
me suspiciously.  (As a former prosecutor, I can tell you that law<br/>
enforcement officers tend to look askance at lone men in parks, for<br/>
more reasons than just the obvious one.)<br/>
<br/>
Rather than replace the box while they were watching me, I tucked it<br/>
under my arm, got on my bike and rode through the picnic area to see<br/>
what was up.  Charcoal grills were lit, hotdogs were cooking . . . <br/>
Unbelievable.  The rangers were having a picnic!!!  They were<br/>
obviously planning on being there for the long haul.  And they were<br/>
watching me.<br/>
<br/>
There was no way I could replant the box without the rangers seeing<br/>
me.  And I wasn't about to ask permission because, at best, I foresaw<br/>
a long, long discussion with lots of skeptical stares ("so you hide<br/>
this thing in the woods, and other people come looking for it, and . .<br/>
.").  It's possible that I could have persuaded them.  It's also<br/>
possible that the box would have been confiscated.<br/>
<br/>
So . . . I tucked the box in my bag and took it home with me.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I did the wrong thing, but I couldn't think of anything else.<br/>
 At least this way I can dry it out and replace the bags.  I`ll<br/>
replant it when I ride by next week, probably on Tuesday.  Apologies<br/>
to Schizokeet (the planter) and anyone else who might have been<br/>
planning to search this weekend.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Under the circumstances and I'm assuming that the box is very close <br/>
to your home/work and convenient to return to I'd of done the same <br/>
thing. On the plus side...as you pointed out...you are also going to <br/>
be able to do some maintenance on the box in the process. You have <br/>
notified everyone here that the box is temporarily out of commission <br/>
and I'd assume that you notified the placer also.<br/>
<br/>
So I'd just get the box back in place asap and I'd assume that it <br/>
should be by the end of the weekend...unless those were real hungry <br/>
park rangers or they decided to "camp out" for the holiday weekend!<br/>
