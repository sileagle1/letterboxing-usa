This has been a great weekend for letterboxing here in Oregon.  Friday I<br/>
kidnapped John and we were able to scout out some new spots for stamps I<br/>
want to place (stamps are now carved, just have to get the LB's together<br/>
and then place them...) probably sometime in August when every weekend<br/>
on my calendar is not booked solid.  <br/>
<br/>
We were able to nab a couple of dvn trckr boxes at the coast:  Sitka<br/>
Spruce just outside of Seaside and Ecola Letterbox right in the heart of<br/>
Cannon Beach!  At both those we came across geoboxes first, but<br/>
eventually found the letterboxes we were seeking!  The Ecola Letterbox<br/>
is totally adorable.  It really got a smile out of us.  What a sweet<br/>
little stamp!  We also managed to score a couple mystery boxes this<br/>
weekend, which was a great bonus! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who place letterboxes in the Pacific NW.  We are very<br/>
grateful for the wonderful art we come across in our travels.  What a<br/>
blast!!!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
