<br/>
The Today Show just had a brief mention of letterboxing during a segment on <br/>
things to do."  They showed the main page of the LbNA web site, as well as<br/>
the U.S. map on the Clues page, but I didn't catch all the audio.  Perhaps<br/>
the clip will be up on the website in the next few days (http://today.msnbc<br/>
msn.com)   In the meantime, those of you in the western timezones might<br/>
still catch it this morning... it was about 37 minutes after the hour.<br/>
