                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Fingers Lakes are a most pleasant place to spend a weekend. Being <br/>
a Northern California boy, I'm a bit of a wine snob, and while our <br/>
local Connecticut wines are laughable, the Finger Lakes region boasts <br/>
some of the finest I've ever tasted. It's amazing how we could <br/>
squeeze in wine tasting, motorcycle touring, my business <br/>
responsibilities, and letterboxing into one weekend, but the <br/>
wonderful folks of the Finger Lakes made it easily possible.<br/>
<br/>
You MUST go letterboxing there! The countryside is postcard beautiful <br/>
and the letterboxes are perfect. We were lucky enough to find several <br/>
in the Ithaca region, both easy ones and hard, and they were all very <br/>
nicely done with excellent and fun clues, great hikes, and marvelous <br/>
stamp art. Plus it is always a treat to see the personal stamps of <br/>
letterboxers we only "know" on the list.<br/>
<br/>
We had a great time finding The Plantations. This is an exceptionally <br/>
fine botanical garden (no surprise, since it's part of a little <br/>
university called "Cornell"). Sapsucker Woods and the Index Finger <br/>
were also terrific. We were also lucky enough to find an exquisitely <br/>
done mystery box.<br/>
<br/>
There is a Gathering planned for tomorrow in the Finger Lakes: wish <br/>
we could be there with you!<br/>

Hi, Jay, curious about the mystery box - is it one of the seven NY <br/>
mystery boxes published on the LbNA site, or is there possibly a box <br/>
in the area I don't know about?<br/>
