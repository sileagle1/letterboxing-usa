                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good Morning All,  Just came back from checking on my letterbox that <br/>
i planted on May 4, 2005.  I made a booklet for the stampers out of <br/>
acid free paper and held it together with yarn.  It is just about <br/>
filled up so i replaced it with a new one.  I want to thank all the <br/>
letterboxers for taking care of the Forefather's Letterbox in <br/>
Plymouth, MA<br/>
Everything was replaced in the ziploc bags, container sealed <br/>
airtight, and rehidden well.  I really appreciate it with the <br/>
nor'east rainstorms and now T-storms we have been having i was happy <br/>
to see all was dry and well cared for.<br/>
My plan for my first stampers on the Forefather's Letterbox is; I am <br/>
going to make a framed collage out of the stamps.  They are so nice!<br/>
eyebob, team smievens,K&amp;M Enterprises, beachcombers,grammy &amp; bumper,<br/>
JD Squirell, BorisDM &amp; peanut, pathfinder, Nash, Heath, Tracy, and <br/>
Janae.  Your stamps will be in my first collage. :)<br/>
We were out yesterday letterboxing and had a ball, the weather was <br/>
perfect for it.  It is wonderful discovering places I never even knew <br/>
existed.<br/>
Those not in the New England area if you would like to see the <br/>
Forefather's monumet just click on image and type in forefather's <br/>
monument.  It should come up!   HLB<br/>
All have a safe and fun holiday<br/>
