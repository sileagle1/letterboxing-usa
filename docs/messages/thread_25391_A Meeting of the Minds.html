<div class="moz-text-flowed" lang="x-unicode">Had a nice day yesterday. 
      Schizokeet and I ventured north to Penns Woods to catch up with a 
      few letterboxers and old friends in Downingtown.
      <br/>
<br/>
      On the way we did grad a couple of drive-bys en route and find one
      on an 3½ mile hike, though we looked for several others.  I think
      we have been doing so little letterboxing that we have just simply
      gotten out of practice in finding them, that and they were old
      boxes that have not likely been found in a while.  The hike was
      nice though, and it was a great day to get out on the trail and
      stumbling over many a rock.
      <br/>
<br/>
      Victory Brewing was our chosen meeting place, set in motion by
      Mama Wolf and the lovely female half of the Seekers from North
      Carolina. They are on a whirlwind trip of their own, letterboxing
      and visiting friends in Philly and then Pittsburgh.
      <br/>
<br/>
      We had a great mix of folks, from states far and wide.  Lightning
      Bug did the footwork of putting it together, and he brought along
      Dingus Dufus, who happened to be in town.  I think I actually met
      him years ago at the gather in Groton when Hikers and Hounds and I
      did a whirlwind trip of our own.
      <br/>
<br/>
      Sheba and Psyker rolled in.  I had not seen Psyker in more then a
      few years, and it was great to catch up in person.
      <br/>
<br/>
      Sir Braemoor, as he is being called now,  meet us at the door, as
      he was there early and already taking on a few pints.  I am not
      sure he actually paid for any more drinks himself that afternoon.
      <br/>
<br/>
      Finally, I got to meet Aiphid, the eeeevil genius, and the quiet
      Crafty Lobster.  I had had a traveling box of his that fell into
      the black hole of my down stairs room for sometime, which I think
      Sheba had pawned off on my, and I got the chance to pawn back to
      him, so the circle is now complete.
      <br/>
<br/>
      We all talked about everything under the sun, life, beer politics,
      letterboxing, and more letterboxing.  I had not been doing much at
      all, having not planted a box in over a year, which I still have
      to write clues for, and not really finding many of late either. 
      Heck, we were in Florida for two weeks a few months ago and only
      walked away with one box on a short walk.  It really kinda
      reinvigorated me.  I have clues to write, boxes to find, and ideas
      to implement, and it was great to get together with other folks,
      some of whom are a little burned out to, and get the juices
      flowing again.
      <br/>
<br/>
      Afterwards we set out to slackbox Stone Soup, a close by Lightning
      Bug box.  There we old first, second and third generation
      letterboxers showed to he true meaning of stealth, compass
      coordination, and and respect for parkland that had been trod upon
      and dug up a thousand times before.
      <br/>
<br/>
      It was a great day, long, with a lot of driving for us, but it was
      wonderful to get out and enjoy the company of some great friends,
      as well as make a few new ones.

What a great day! It sounds like an old-fashioned gathering, instead of an event. I'm glad to hear of friends having fun and being reinvigorated. <br/>
