In response to requests from others at the Winter MA Gathering, The<br/>
Yachtsman and I are offering to sponsor a spring gathering on Cape Cod<br/>
and are interested in floating a potential date out there to see what<br/>
the response might be.  Currently we are looking at Saturday, May 3rd<br/>
as a potential date, and the event would probably be at Nickerson<br/>
State Park in Brewster, MA.  The Yachtsman is currently checking the<br/>
availability of a picnic pavilion (in case of rain).  The park opens<br/>
