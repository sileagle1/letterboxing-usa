<br/>
Southeastern Pennsylvania, Delaware County, near Gradyville, PA, <br/>
placed by Arbo on 6/12/02 <br/>
A 2-3 hour hike located in the outer Philly suburbs in beautiful <br/>
Ridley Creek State Park.<br/>
Getting there: From I-476 South, Take exit 3 (Rt.1 South). Turn right <br/>
onto PA 352 North. Pass by Granite Run Mall. At 4th stoplight turn <br/>
right onto Gradyville Rd. At stop sign turn right. Continue on that <br/>
road past the park office to picnic area #14. From there the game's <br/>
afoot. <br/>
<br/>
Clues<br/>
<br/>
Blue is a color you should know, follow this trail Northeast bound <br/>
you go.<br/>
<br/>
Through tunneled foliage lush and green, across hard pavement where <br/>
cars careen.<br/>
<br/>
Past a settler house old and crumbled, treasure you seek be not <br/>
humbled.<br/>
<br/>
At the juncture with an end, go by a tree that once had been.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on down blue pathway, around many turns along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Up a hill with blue and yellow, your time is short with this cowardly <br/>
fellow.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on with Mr. Blue, the shiny loot calls to you.<br/>
<br/>
Cross a road man has built, pass a pole with blue-white hilt.<br/>
<br/>
Over the bridge across the stream, then up the hill a hiker's dream.<br/>
<br/>
Up the hill first left then right, Mr. Blue's here do not fright.<br/>
<br/>
At the top a green grass ocean, continue right around the commotion.<br/>
<br/>
Find the path the color of light, "Not much farther", Mr. White knows <br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
Down the hill and to the arrow, continue on down the 360 degree <br/>
narrow.<br/>
<br/>
Past the trees with carvings askew, soon Ridley Creek will come into <br/>
view.<br/>
<br/>
At the bottom where rapids flow, with the current you will go.<br/>
<br/>
To the second fallen tree, a bridge Mother Nature built for free.<br/>
<br/>
Across this sidewalk you will go, to find a letterbox a secret to <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
Here the path is hard to see, you will pick it up at One-ten degree.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on down the way, along the angler's pathway.<br/>
<br/>
Spy a bench on a boulder, continue along the water's shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
Three boulders you come to on a turn, turn right through the pathway <br/>
your feet do yearn.<br/>
<br/>
Watch the stream along the way, many rocks you might say.<br/>
<br/>
But you'll find these rocks with two large trees, your compass will <br/>
work from one of these.<br/>
