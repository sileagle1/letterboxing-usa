Letterboxing supplies:  the "pink stuff, tupperware, ziploc bags, 3x5 cards <br/>
(spiral), carving supplies etc.  Kristopher asked if we could send a supply so <br/>
that some of the soldiers could box while there, to pass the time when not on <br/>
duty.  These letterboxes will not be "in the field" but on military <br/>
installations, I'm guessing.<br/>
<br/>
Anything the boxers from CT could donate would be greatly appreciated!  <br/>
E-mail me privately if you would like to add any items to the box!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">After being rejected after hauling a 14 lb. box and standing in line<br/>
at the Post Office, I discovered that one thing you cannot do is<br/>
mention anything related to "knife" or "blade" on the customs list. <br/>
You cannot ship X-acto knives &amp; blades. For the speedball cutting &amp;<br/>
carving blades I strongly suggest not calling them as such (and this<br/>
was strongly hinted to me by the woman in the Post Office because she<br/>
couldn't come right out and say it).  So I took them out of the<br/>
package and put them into a baggie and labeled them as "nibs" (they do<br/>
look like pen &amp; ink nibs).  The holders I called "nib holders", easy<br/>
since that was what they were called on the order form from Stampeze.<br/>
 The problem it turns out is shipping dangerous "knife/blade" things,<br/>
and the package might be stolen before it reaches its destination<br/>
simply because of the words: "knife" and "blade" on the customs list.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
