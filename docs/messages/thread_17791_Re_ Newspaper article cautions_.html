                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Laurie Doobie's gentle comments match my sentiments to a T! We all <br/>
learned about letterboxing somehow, and for most of us it was not on <br/>
Grandpappie's knee, it was from the printed word. Denigrating <br/>
comments about "Family Fun" magazines are uncalled for. After all, <br/>
this is an ideal hobby for families and gets kids, moms and dads out <br/>
into nature. Too many of our nation's children  sit isolated and <br/>
uninvolved in human interaction  in front of a T.V., cruising the <br/>
internet or playing video games.  Yes, of course it is important to <br/>
be discrete and thoughtful while being interviewed by a reporter. <br/>
However, let's not become gate keeping elitists about who should and <br/>
should not be privy to this healthy wholesome harmless hobby. <br/>

Trail .&amp;nbsp; It interested me, so I checked&amp;nbsp; the web.&amp;nbsp; Found a clue <br/>
for a letterbox in my area that I happen to have been to before and found my <br/>
first letter box.&amp;nbsp; Haven't founded many on LI but checked out some in CT <br/>
when I visited my son.&amp;nbsp; I think word of mouth is the best way to learn <br/>
about letterboxing &amp;amp; of course the web site.&amp;nbsp; It worked for me.<br/>
