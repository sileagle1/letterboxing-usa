<br/>
A couple weeks back it was reported that the Tripod Letterbox, which <br/>
is part of the Pyramid Moutain Series in New Jersey was missing.  <br/>
Today I finally got a chance to go and check on it.  I was surprised <br/>
to find it was still there, exactly where placed.  <br/>
<br/>
Apparently at some point in November someone found the box and placed <br/>
it by a makeshift memorial to the WTC disaster.  Dozens of folks <br/>
(mostly non-letterboxers) used the notebook to jot down their <br/>
thoughts and prayers to all those who were affected by the events of <br/>
9/11.  Then sometime in early December a letterboxer (I can't <br/>
remember who, sorry) placed the box back at it's original hiding <br/>
spot.   <br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty much amazed that this box was out in the open for at least <br/>
a couple weeks and not one person thought to trash it.  Just goes to <br/>
show you how much this country has changed since those events in <br/>
September.<br/>

PS The box is back in it's original hiding spot for anyone who wants <br/>
to search for it.<br/>
