Is there a new 'plastic baggie rule'???<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if there's a new 'unwritten' rule on the books <br/>
somewhere that encourages folks to put letterbox containers 'inside' <br/>
of 'zippie' plastic baggies?  On a recent letterboxing binge of <br/>
ours, we noticed that increasingly boxes in entire regions were <br/>
planted 'inside' of zippie plastic bags.  Familiar with a few of <br/>
these letterbox planters and knowing that planting <br/>
letterboxes 'inside' of plastic bags wasn't a typical trait of <br/>
theirs, I'm now wondering if kindly folks are 'fixing' boxes they <br/>
visit along the way by bagging, double-bagging and in one instance <br/>
even 'triple-bagging' letterboxes they visit?<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if this was the original letterbox planter's intent or <br/>
not.  Of the 190+ letterboxes we've planted around the world, only <br/>
one was planted 'intentionally' inside of a plastic bag for <br/>
camouflage sake (and nobody has yet visited that particular <br/>
letterbox as it's on another continent--not known much for <br/>
letterboxing).  Reason being--bags on the outside of letterbox <br/>
containers usually negate any attempts to camouflage the container <br/>
itself--as their shiny signature generally reflects light <br/>
exceptionally well in outdoor environments. Well-intentioned folks <br/>
who accidentally stumble across a 'full' plastic bag along a trail <br/>
usually don't examine what's in the bag, instead they may just pick <br/>
it up as litter and discard it--oblivious to the true treasure that <br/>
actually resides inside the well-intentioned 'baggie'.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, we recently came across two plastic bags in a certain <br/>
famous park in that gorgeous city by the bay.  One contained drug <br/>
parapharnelia (YUCK, YUCK, YUCK says Mr Yuck!--so I'm dating myself <br/>
here) and another contained animal excrement (YUCK!)--had the <br/>
letterbox we were looking for around that tree actually been there &amp; <br/>
not missing, we would never even have investigated these other <br/>
disgusting baggies in the first place--instantly assuming they <br/>
contained gross things.<br/>
<br/>
Wonder if there's any confusion out there about the 'double bag' <br/>
concept--regarding double-bagging the logbook itself 'within' the <br/>
letterbox container &amp; not actually 'double-bagging' the letterbox <br/>
container itself?<br/>
<br/>

I have come across a hand full of letterboxes placed in ziplocks. <br/>
Usually these bags have been rendered useless as watertight protecton <br/>
due to tears and nonfunctioning "zippers". I carry large ziplocks and <br/>
a couple grocery store bags to use in triage cases.  When a box is <br/>
totally compromised by cracks or breaks I'll clean out contents, <br/>
rebag, then enclose the entire box in plastic in an attempt to <br/>
preserve its contents until more permanent repairs can be made.As an <br/>
aside, Chuck and Molly used black rubber pool liner material to wrap  <br/>
boxes hidden for the Mansfield Monster Mash.  This treatment offered <br/>
great camo. plus protection from rain.<br/>

Certainly not in my personal rulebook! Those exterior bags tend to fall apart in short <br/>
order, attract attention and hold moisture next to the box long after the surrounding <br/>
areas are dry. At that point, they cause more harm than good.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, I checked on a very special letterbox that I had hidden on Maui for <br/>
Legerdemaine. Someone had removed all the inner bags and used one of them to encase <br/>
the entire box. This fit was so tight that I had to shred the bag to open the box! I am so <br/>
pleased that I got there to replace the double bags around all the contents before <br/>
everything was destroyed. <br/>
<br/>
For future reference, the contents of my letterboxes are always double bagged.<br/>
If you find that the inner bags in any of my letterboxes are damaged I would be forever <br/>
grateful if you replaced them but PLEASE do not put an exterior bag around any of my <br/>
boxes. <br/>
<br/>
This same topic has had some lively discussion on the Atlas Quest boards. I am glad it <br/>
had migrated over here too. It's an issue that affects the longevity of all of our planted <br/>
treasures. Funhog<br/>

I use the gallon ziplocks for additional protection to the letterbox <br/>
BUT with exterior camo burlap -- I've even had a hard time finding my <br/>
own boxes.  The burlap may end up rotting away - but even the shreds <br/>
can serve as camo and meanwhile it protects the ziplock.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure about changing the appearance of someone elses box <br/>
unless they new I was going after it and would do maintenance.<br/>

I'm not advocating that anybody add outer bags without permission, <br/>
but there have been times when people have wrapped a letterbox for me <br/>
and I've appreciated it. <br/>
<br/>
I used a lot of the rubbermaid sandwich containers with the white <br/>
plastic lid before I realized that they tend to leak. One example is <br/>
a letterbox under a bridge in the Utah desert during a drought. Seems <br/>
the condensation of vapor from the river kept getting into the box. <br/>
The logbook was well bagged, but I was still worried because every <br/>
report I got told me they had to dry out the inside of the box. So <br/>
when someone was kind enough to wrap it in a large baggie, I was very <br/>
thankful.<br/>
<br/>
That letterbox doesn't get enough traffic to wear out the bag. And <br/>
it's well covered enough so that the bag doesn't show to passersby. <br/>
So I think there are some instances when an outer bag may end up <br/>
saving a journal.<br/>
<br/>
Just my dos centavos,<br/>
y-nought<br/>

I got mine in the hunting and sporting goods section of Walmart.  They<br/>
have two types and unfortunately, I can't remember exactly what they<br/>
are made of.  I was cautioned to not use the type that is like a<br/>
burlap because it disintegrates too quickly.  <br/>

I'm fairly new to letterboxing in the past yr. and have fournd aprox 25 bx's. I live in the north east and have picked up boxes in a few states. All of these boxes but maybe one have been bagged. Maybe it's the enviorment you live in. I did grab a box in Fl. last month and it was not bagged and it was soaked. There is usually enough cover to hide and rehide around here so as not to accidently spot a baggie.<br/>

Is there a new 'plastic baggie rule'???<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if there's a new 'unwritten' rule on the books <br/>
somewhere that encourages folks to put letterbox containers 'inside' <br/>
of 'zippie' plastic baggies?  On a recent letterboxing binge of <br/>
ours, we noticed that increasingly boxes in entire regions were <br/>
planted 'inside' of zippie plastic bags.  Familiar with a few of <br/>
these letterbox planters and knowing that planting <br/>
letterboxes 'inside' of plastic bags wasn't a typical trait of <br/>
theirs, I'm now wondering if kindly folks are 'fixing' boxes they <br/>
visit along the way by bagging, double-bagging and in one instance <br/>
even 'triple-bagging' letterboxes they visit?<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if this was the original letterbox planter's intent or <br/>
not.  Of the 190+ letterboxes we've planted around the world, only <br/>
one was planted 'intentionally' inside of a plastic bag for <br/>
camouflage sake (and nobody has yet visited that particular <br/>
letterbox as it's on another continent--not known much for <br/>
letterboxing).  Reason being--bags on the outside of letterbox <br/>
containers usually negate any attempts to camouflage the container <br/>
itself--as their shiny signature generally reflects light <br/>
exceptionally well in outdoor environments. Well-intentioned folks <br/>
who accidentally stumble across a 'full' plastic bag along a trail <br/>
usually don't examine what's in the bag, instead they may just pick <br/>
it up as litter and discard it--oblivious to the true treasure that <br/>
actually resides inside the well-intentioned 'baggie'.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, we recently came across two plastic bags in a certain <br/>
famous park in that gorgeous city by the bay.  One contained drug <br/>
parapharnelia (YUCK, YUCK, YUCK says Mr Yuck!--so I'm dating myself <br/>
here) and another contained animal excrement (YUCK!)--had the <br/>
letterbox we were looking for around that tree actually been there &amp; <br/>
not missing, we would never even have investigated these other <br/>
disgusting baggies in the first place--instantly assuming they <br/>
contained gross things.<br/>
<br/>
Wonder if there's any confusion out there about the 'double bag' <br/>
concept--regarding double-bagging the logbook itself 'within' the <br/>
letterbox container &amp; not actually 'double-bagging' the letterbox <br/>
container itself?<br/>

Rainy, soggy, miserable Pacific Northwest and I never 'outer bag' a <br/>
letterbox because double-bagging with the logbook &amp; stamp with <br/>
freezer bags on the 'inside' of letterboxes generally does this <br/>
trick.  I guess what my point here is that folks are putting other <br/>
people's letterboxes inside plastic baggies without telling the <br/>
letterbox planter in the first place.  Then the boxes are more <br/>
difficult to camouflage well (especially in a situation with limited <br/>
camouflage materials--unlike our case here in the Northwest) but my <br/>
recent experience in an arid part of the country (with limited <br/>
camouflage materials lying around) sort of proved to me that folks <br/>
haven't been spending much effort in 'recamouflaging' these boxes <br/>
now planted inside of plastic bags.  Not sure if this explains it <br/>
clearly or not?  I'm just wondering if there's a new rule or note in <br/>
a letterboxing FAQ or discussion board somewhere encouraging folks <br/>
to 'outer bag' letterboxes that they visit (and not just necessarily <br/>
the ones they plant themselves)?<br/>

Outer plastic bags can also give critters something easy to grab onto with <br/>
teeth or paws/claws. I've found a decent number of outer-bagged boxes <br/>
pulled away (or so I assume, from what look like teeth marks puncturing the <br/>
bags) from their hiding places and left out in the open. Also, once an <br/>
outer bag gets any kind of small hole or tear in it, water leaks in and the <br/>
outer bag then traps the water around the box instead of protecting the box <br/>
from the elements as intended.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is a regional thing, but I see far more reasons to avoid outer <br/>
bags than to include them. I'd be very unhappy if some finder chose to add <br/>
an outer bag to one of my boxes without checking with me first (unless the <br/>
box itself was damaged and that was the only way to protect it until it <br/>
could be replaced).<br/>

Hey Turtle McQ, you must be talking about my boxes.:-)  That's one <br/>
of the reasons I stopped using the outter bag.  Living in the bayous <br/>
of Louisiana little critters are everywhere and I don't want to give <br/>
them an edge.  Since water is always present around here, liquid and <br/>
gaseous, the double bag log is a must.<br/>

For a short while when I first began placing boxes I used an outer <br/>
bag, but soon realized they were more harm than good.  It doesn't <br/>
take too long for even a heavy-duty freezer bag to become torn as it <br/>
is taken in and out of a hiding spot -- tree bark, sticks, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than keep water out, the bag tends to hold moisture and keep <br/>
the box continually damp.  I have also found that the boxes in bags <br/>
seem to be more of a curiosity to critters, not to mention the bag <br/>
gives them an easy way to drag it off.<br/>
<br/>
As a general rule, a letterbox should be left as it was found -- <br/>
unless you are replacing a damaged baggie, and would rather not have <br/>
my boxes placed inside outer bags.  Thanks!<br/>

I haven't done it with a wooden box painted to look like stone, but we're in <br/>
the process of putting together a box using an unused stone cremation urn to <br/>
hold the stamp and logbook because I think it'll blend in well with the <br/>
environment.  The only thing that worries me is that those types of urns aren't <br/>
exactly cheap, and I'd hate for someone to steal it should they come across it.    <br/>
