  Subject: [LbNA] The Wonder of it All<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you sooooo much to those who replied to me both on and off <br/>
  list. It seems that letterboxers are a nurturing crowd. I realize <br/>
  now, with some embarrasment at the foolishment of some of my original <br/>
  inquiries (blush).  However, I have been perusing the resources found <br/>
  on the LBNA website as well some of the wonderful private websites.  <br/>
  I am amazed at the depths of this hobby. <br/>
<br/>
  The best part is that even my husband, who thought that this would be <br/>
  a passing fancy for me and our girls (as I'm chagrined to say has <br/>
  happened in the past - <grinning>) has expressed an interest in <br/>
  Letterboxing<br/>
  .<br/>
  Wasn't I surprised to come home from a bible study last nite to find <br/>
  him and our son hunched over the dining room table which was covered <br/>
  in maps. Each had a compass in hand, walking around the maps mumbling <br/>
  something about "triangulation".<br/>
  Apparently, they had stumbled upon clues for a "mystery box" that is <br/>
  local to us. I was somewhat overwhelmed, but delighted at how much <br/>
  fun they were having.  At one point, my son literally jumped up, <br/>
  exclaiming "I know, Dad". He ran to his room, shortly to return with <br/>
  an armful of books. One in particular "Johnny Tremain" seemed to hold <br/>
  deep interest for them. As I said, it was a little beyond me, but I <br/>
  know how this weekend will be spent (LOL). <br/>
<br/>
  The girls and I have been discussing trail names and I think we are <br/>
  close to choosing one. We all want it to be "just perfect". We're <br/>
  also excited about carving our first stamp.<br/>
  (Any tips here?) and a trip to our local Michaels has been planned <br/>
  for this evening.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks :)<br/>
