list: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/message/2624  led me to <br/>
finding one of my most treasured spots on the web. The homepage of the American <br/>
Bungalow magazine. Ah the days of periodical shelving at the bookstore when my <br/>
hands ran over the smooth cover of this well known publication. Yes, these homes <br/>
now "historic" are some of my most favorite designs.<br/>
<br/>
In keeping with this bit of nostalgia I would like to share a story. I'm not much for <br/>
history, I hated it in school and always lucked out with terrible professors. Boring <br/>
and not inspiring subject matter for me. Being the young whippersnapper that I <br/>
have been called before, I went through years where history was nothing but a bore <br/>
to me. <br/>
<br/>
Until I discovered letterboxing. A small waterfront park, early 1900's architecture, <br/>
all of a sudden I developed some sort of crazy interest in local history. In art <br/>
history, architecture, landscaping and plants. Where did this evolve from you ask?  <br/>
It is some of this history that is inside each of these treasured boxes that I place. I <br/>
have lately been gravitating towards historical locations, architecture and people. <br/>
After all those years of hating history it is nice to know some things come full <br/>
circle. <br/>
<br/>
Wes, thanks for keeping post-archives. <br/>

Phyto, thank you so much for that happy jaunt down memory lane on one <br/>
of my own most treasured spots on the web! I spent a few moments <br/>
reading the posts from that week and they were kinda....sweet. Those <br/>
were some good days and I miss the folks that were involved in that <br/>
string: Mapsurfer, Erik, LoneWolf, Tom, and Thom. (no Harry back <br/>
then). I particularly enjoyed this innocent thought from Randy:<br/>
<br/>
<looks 300="" 35="" <br="" and="" at="" close="" clues="" got="" least="" like="" states,="" to="" we've="">
accessable on-line, at least 1 person whose found 100 and one<br/>
whos planted 100 (almost?), and at least 1 region where letterboxing<br/>
has really taken root. Not bad.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, history!<br/>
