(while my previous response focused on cheap. easy. and chemical free <br/>
and kid friendly, I am only 27 and definitely 'new school' enough to <br/>
know that there are a phenomenal amount of ways to get a stamp image on <br/>
a stamp for carving (from blenderpens, to paperless lithography, to <br/>
packing tape transfers, to going to an office supply store and saying, <br/>
"make me a stamp"), and there is plenty of time, and plenty of rubber <br/>
to figure out what works for you)<br/>
<br/>
Without further ado:  An Inkjet Transfer Method:<br/>
<br/>
A) get print out of high contrast image/black and white image on inkjet <br/>
windowclings (I believe inkjet transparencies will work here as well) <br/>
Text/image should not be backwards.<br/>
<br/>
B)Print it out on the proper side/as per directions. (if you print out <br/>
small images, be sure to cut off with a straight line, so that you can <br/>
run it through the printer without using the whole sheet at once.<br/>
<br/>
C)take the carving medium and some elmers glue and put a *very* thin <br/>
coating on the medium  (think almost invisible -- there shouldn't be <br/>
enough to squish at all.<br/>
<br/>
D) on a flat surface, press the glue side of the carving medium to the <br/>
duller/printed side of the window cling/transparency.  Don't shift the <br/>
image when you press.  Allow this to sit for a few minutes. (a bit of <br/>
pressure helps here.<br/>
<br/>
E) carefully peel off the transparency... voila!  image transfered!<br/>
<br/>
F) let the glue dry before carving... you should be able to soak/rub <br/>
off any trace of glue if you like when you are finished carving -- but <br/>
the glue membrane may peel up as you carve tiny details, so be sure to <br/>
outline with a razor blade, work carefully, and resist the urge to peel <br/>
up the glue until you are done.  Other more flexible water-based glues <br/>
should work as well.<br/>
=-=-=-=<br/>
Another option is:<br/>
Print out on whatever paper you have, and glue it (or use sticker <br/>
paper) directly to the carving medium. then using a pointy razor blade <br/>
out-line all the edges that would be carved.  This time the print-out <br/>
should be backwards.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of my stamp images, including one made (quickly!) with <br/>
the transfer method above.<br/>

<br/>
Anyway, Happy Carving!<br/>

there is another way besides the one that was mentioned, but I <br/>
don't remember exactly what it was.  There is a chemical that <br/>
transfers the ink like acetone does with toner based printouts.  I <br/>
don't remember what the chemical was.  If it isn't in the archive of <br/>
this list, it might be in the carving consortium.  If I find it, I will <br/>
send a reference to the list.<br/>
