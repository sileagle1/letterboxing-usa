the hill for the permanent boxes will just have to go back for those <br/>
but  with the help of Allan from Axtown had a great time finding all <br/>
the event boxes.  It was a terrific gathering!  So much effort and <br/>
organizing was evident in how well it all came together. <br/>
   Pink Trotters hit her 100 th box happily and is still smiling <br/>
about it. A couple of hitch hikers made their way to us and will pop <br/>
up in unexpected places.  We enjoyed seeing old friends and new . <br/>
Can't wait to see you all again . On the trail ....Leader of the Pack<br/>
