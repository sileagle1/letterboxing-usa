Directions: From the intersection of RT66 and RT.85,Take 85 north for<br/>
0.7 of a mile and turn down the road with the boat launch sign,this is<br/>
the entrance to Holbrook Pond.Drive down a little ways and park in the<br/>
parking area on the right before the pond.(This is the same starting<br/>
point as Red Men at Holbrook Pond.) Enter the trail and walk over the<br/>
wooden bridge you will see the dam on your left.Continue down the trail<br/>
( some muddy areas but you can walk around them) soon you will see a<br/>
trail going off to the right but you keep going straight.You will pass<br/>
by a stone wall off to your right and you will come to a small stream<br/>
cross over and keep on the main trail.Then you will come to another<br/>
stream that feeds into the pond (DO NOT CROSS) follow up stream a little<br/>
bit and you will see a big rotted tree that has fallen,in the end of<br/>
this tree opposite side of the stump under some dead pieces of wood is<br/>
the letterbox.return the way you came.The NeeDeeps. <br/>
