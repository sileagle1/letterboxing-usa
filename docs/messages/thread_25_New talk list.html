For those of you who are not on the Other list, I wanted to let you know<br/>
that I finally found my first letterbox!  It was a big moment (almost as<br/>
big as the mosquitoes).  I can hardly wait to do it again!  (So, Shannon,<br/>
do you have a box out there yet?)  Texas letterboxers exist!  Yay.<br/>

Want to buy a book?  I'm trying to make a life-long dream come true and<br/>
open a bookshop.  It's tiny, but it grows now and then.  Come see!<br/>
