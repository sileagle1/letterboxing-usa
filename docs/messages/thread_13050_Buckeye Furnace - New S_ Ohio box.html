Buckeye Furnace<br/>
<br/>
Come out into the boonies and marvel at this restored relic of our <br/>
mid-19th century forefathers' industrial might.  The beautifully laid <br/>
stone stack of this old charcoal blast furnace looks sturdy enough to <br/>
light back up any time.  We placed this microbox (please bring stamp <br/>
pad and pencil with you!) to bring you up close to our fire breathing <br/>
past.<br/>
<br/>
To get there, take State Route #32 to the intersection near Wellston <br/>
where State Route #124 separates from State Route #32.  Take State <br/>
Route #124 east about 4 miles and look for the brown and white sign <br/>
pointing to the Buckeye Furnace State Memorial 3 miles down Buckeye <br/>
Furnace Road.  Follow the signs to the memorial.  (If you look <br/>
carefully, you may see a beaver or two in the wetland along the road <br/>
to the furnace!)  When you get to the furnace (it sits right beside <br/>
the road), make your way into the casting shed at the base of the <br/>
furnace (it has a huge wooden wheel in it.) and walk up to the mouth <br/>
of the beast.  Below the big stone engraved with the builder's name, <br/>
the opening features a series of big iron ledges that the fire brick <br/>
of the furnace liner rests on.  Look on the right side of the lowest <br/>
of these for a small dark stone behind which you'll find the memento <br/>
of your trip that you seek.  Please email us at <br/>
bigguy_45640@yahoo.com if you find it and let us know how it's doing.<br/>
