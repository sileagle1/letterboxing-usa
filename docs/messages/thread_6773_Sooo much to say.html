<div></div>I usually don't post to the list except to put out clues but there has been a lot flying around the last couple of days I've decided to chime in. First of all about micro boxes. I think Scott Redd has what is probably the smallest box I've heard of. His micro box is a film canister. Tough to find too. Second, Who cares if LizButt is 5 or 50, I think we are all children at heart (why else would we be out looking for hidden treasure?) Third, I personally think that the stats are OK (Obviously, since I have them in my signature) so keep track and be PROUD! And Fourth, I like to hear about first finds. Granted I don't have many boxes out right now, (I've got about 6 waiting to go), but I like to know when my boxes have been found with out having to go back out and check them. As far as the "First Finder Certificates" I think that that is a great idea! Maybe I will begin to incorporate that in my boxes. Lastly, I see off topic subjects as a means to help the sport/game evolve. Sometimes new ideas come from the strangest places. Anyway, that is just my 2 cents worth. So can we all just get back to enjoying each others company and doing some boxing and creating?<br/><br/>
