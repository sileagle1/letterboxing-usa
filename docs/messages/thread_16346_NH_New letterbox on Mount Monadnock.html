the most hiked mountain in the world -  Here's one that's on a trail <br/>
less traveled:<br/>
<br/>
HERON HIKER HEADS HOME LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Planted: 10/11/03  by Ginger Blue<br/>
Location: Mt. Monadnock  Jaffrey/Marlborough, NH<br/>
Trail Difficulty: Depends on how you get there<br/>
Clues: Easy<br/>
Length: Again  it depends on how you get there, but see "Getting <br/>
There"  below.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
	Stand where the intersection of the Marlboro and Marion <br/>
trails meet, marked by white arrows. Take 18 steps to a small (in <br/>
2003) Spruce tree at a bearing of 320 degrees.  Take another 14 or 15 <br/>
steps along this same bearing being careful to stay on the rocks and <br/>
not step on the lowbush blueberry bushes. Two steps away, at 25 <br/>
degrees, is a loose flat slab of granite about 1  ft. by 2 ft.  The <br/>
Heron Hiker is taking a rest under the NE side of this slab before it <br/>
heads home.<br/>
<br/>
Getting There:<br/>
	There are many starting points and therefore many roads to <br/>
get to Mt. Monadnock.  If you are looking for the shortest way to get <br/>
to this box take Shaker Road off Rte 124 in Marlboro (about 7 miles <br/>
from the State Park sign in Jaffrey).  The trailhead to Marlboro <br/>
Trail is on the right about  mile down Shaker Rd. with parking area <br/>
on the left.  If you start here it is about 2.1 miles and two hours <br/>
to the summit (one-way).  You must be especially sure-footed if you <br/>
descend by this trail and a strong-seated pair of pants will help <br/>
coming down the faces of the many large granite rocks on the steep <br/>
upper half of this trail.<br/>
<br/>
Note: If you want to include some of the several other boxes planted <br/>
on the mountain by the Drew Clan and Lonemasswolf and YIMS, you may <br/>
want to choose another starting point.<br/>
