It will go first to the person who signed up for it first (Yeah! Grey Crazy!), and will then make its way through the country by section, based on zip codes. Watch your mail boxes and enjoy!<br/>

YAY!!!  This is the first PLB I'll receive, and I'm first on the <br/>
list.  I know, I know....I won't get to read everyone else's <br/>
entries....that's alright, there will be more boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait!  :-)<br/>
