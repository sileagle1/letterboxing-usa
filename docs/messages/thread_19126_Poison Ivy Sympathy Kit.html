I've never had poison ivy. I've never even seen poison ivy! But after the Woe Is Me posting, and subsequent stories, I have begun to educate myself...because I don't want to get poison ivy! It has been suggested that those who get a bad case of PI should receive the Purple Heart...that traveling stamp for LBNA members suffering injury in the line of letterboxing. Well, I would like to create the Poison Ivy Sympathy Kit...which will travel to anyone who is willing to sign up by sharing their poison ivy horror story with the group. No case too small! <br/>
If you want to receive the Poison Ivy Sympathy Kit, post your story if you haven't already done so, then send my your mailing address privately...I'm at SheWhoPlants at aol dot com.<br/>

have two lines of it up the back of my legs (not anywhere else, but two lines <br/>
up the back of my legs!  I think that's odd....)  Then, which could have made <br/>
matters worse, I went to Cape Cod, which is littered with poison ivy!  Many of <br/>
the boxes were right in the middle of poison ivy patches, but much to my <br/>
surprise, the salt water helped, and I didn't get any new patches of poison ivy on <br/>
my body!<br/>
<br/>
Let's hope that this is my LAST outbreak of the season!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A few weeks ago, I went to check on one of my<br/>
letterbox placements to see whether or not the vines<br/>
covering is in March were indeed poison ivy.  I<br/>
discovered that some of them were.  I had my gloves on<br/>
and a hand pruner to cut back some of the offensive<br/>
growth from the vicinity of the box.  I must have used<br/>
my glove later to flick away pesky insects for, a<br/>
couple of days later, I had poison ivy on my ear lobe,<br/>
the tip of my nose, one eyelid and at one corner of my<br/>
mouth.  Fortunately it wasn't a bad case and I very<br/>
intentionally did not touch or rub the areas except to<br/>
daub on Calodryl lotion.  It was gone in a week and a<br/>
half.<br/>
