                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh, my esteemed Mr. Pepe, I can surely vouch for your good deeds.  Was<br/>
it only 1 year ago that your behavior shocked the letterboxing world?<br/>
 Just look how far you have come from that dirty deed.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I lobbied for my own Cape Cod as a location for the<br/>
Pinecone Museum of Splendid Stamped Creations, I gladly supported Mr.<br/>
Pepe in his endeavor to bring it to Connecticut.  He has very<br/>
graciously handed over a percentage of the money he has collected from<br/>
this patch.  With this we have been able to procure a stamp from some<br/>
mysterious and elusive letterboxers and a compass believed to have<br/>
been used to seek out the earliest letterboxes in the United States<br/>
for our displays.  We even have a hitchhiker that has been found by<br/>
Wanda and Pete 11 times and a cootie that went unfound in the depths<br/>
of a backpack for many years before being unearthed.  How wouldn't<br/>
travel far and wide to see these remarkable items?  None of this could<br/>
have been done without the valiant efforts of Mr. Mark Pepe.<br/>
<br/>
Not only has Mr. Pepe started this remarkable undertaking, I have<br/>
personally witnessed that he also never fails to contact the box<br/>
owners with pleasant and grateful notes about boxes.  He always lets<br/>
them know when there is any problem with a box and makes sure to say<br/>
something positive and supportive to the letterboxer.  I have even<br/>
seen him do this when he could not find the box and when it contained<br/>
the dreaded store bought stamp.  How could such a model letterboxer<br/>
even be suspected in this crime of the highest order?  Yes, he stole<br/>
some PZ Kut, but he would never go after the Store of Good Manners.<br/>
<br/>
Surely my word is good enough to exonerate the formerly wayward Mark<br/>
Pepe.  He has changed his unruly PZ Kut stealing ways and is in no way<br/>
responsible for the missing Store of Good Manners.   <br/>
