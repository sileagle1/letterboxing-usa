<p>We are trying to encourage friends of ours to LB with us.  As a house warming gift, we gave them a log book for each child and colorful stamp pads, plus, a selection of truck stamps (they are too little to carve) from which to choose their sig stamp and a collection of BeMa tried and approved clues!  That was before the winter began.  We know they found one of our boxes close by.  They all had a good time and the Dad was really happy about the together time they had peacefully exploring nature.  We'll have to see if they go back out now that the weather is warmer...  I always show our stuff to people who I think would like to LB.  They always think it is a great idea, but, no steady converts to date!  Oh well!  We'll keep trying and in the meantime, having a great time ourselves!  BeMa  </p></div>

<div></div>&gt;I was up in Nashua, NH over the weekend for a Bonspiel (Curling) and was able to find directions (tricky tricky!) from a local to the Gilson Road area to find the Gilson Road and Ghosts in NH letterboxes. 
<div></div>
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>
<div></div>&gt;Both are in great shape and the Gilson Road box has been visited quite often in any season except winter. (to much snow, I'm guessing.) The Ghosts in NH box has had less frequent visitors - I'm wondering if the cemetery was just toooo spooky. 
<div></div>
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>
<div></div>&gt;Very neato place! I was glad I was able to spare an hour out of my trip to go find them (I had to drag the rest of my team, 3 non-letterboxers, with me to do it - which is why I didn't get more boxes while I was there.) 
<div></div>
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>
<div></div>&gt;On another happy note, I think 2 out of the 3 non-letterboxers were intrigued enough that they may try it themselves some day. Any suggestions for how to rope them in? Maybe a gift of some pink stuff and basic carving tools, or a print out for the clues of a fun local box for them? 
<div></div>
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>
<div></div>&gt;Any suggestions are welcome.. thanks!
