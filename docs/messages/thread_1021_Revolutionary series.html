Chip and I were talking on the phone last night about<br/>
the revolutionary wasr series.  I think it would be a<br/>
great idea for hime to do a few in the S.E. CT area. <br/>
As a matter of fact I was saying to him that it would<br/>
be nice to have a series of letterboxes made up of<br/>
historical Revolution sites, that is it need not be<br/>
batlle related.  My feelings were that people were<br/>
thinking along the lines of famous battle sites, but<br/>
it could be so much more all up and down the east<br/>
coast.  For example I was thinking of the town green<br/>
infront of  Lisbon Town hall was a site where Gen.<br/>
Washington camped with his troops for a night.  <br/>
Maybey inorder to tie such a series together we could<br/>
put something onto the sytamps designating that they<br/>
are part of the series.  Something as simple as a R.W.<br/>
or a musket or maybe some sort of symbol used back<br/>
then to distiguish us from the Brits.<br/>
The Highway series sounds like fun, I can see how it<br/>
would breakup a trip, it would also force someone like<br/>
me, a power driver to stop more often and take it<br/>
easy.  Technically there is already at least one<br/>
highway box that I can think of, though it is a little<br/>
bit of a hike off of the rest area.  I would say more<br/>
but it is better kept a "mystery".<br/>
That's all, I hope everyone is having a letterbox<br/>
filled summer.<br/>
<br/>
Take it easy:<br/>

To all,<br/>
<br/>
As Stash indicated by his email, my intention by this<br/>
series was to expose people to the local historical<br/>
aspects of the Revolutionary War, starting with a<br/>
school yard in Waterford, going to historical housing<br/>
in New London (Hempstead) to a local Govenors Mansion<br/>
to a Battle field to the homestead of a Soldier in the<br/>
Battle. I intend to track down the original homestead<br/>
of Benedict Arnold in Norwich, because he plays a<br/>
major  role in my "story".<br/>
<br/>
As far as the highway series goes I am in complete<br/>
agreement with those on the affirmitive side. A good<br/>
way to break up a long trip, not just another stamp!<br/>
Plus, you never know how well they can "stump" you!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
<br/>
Chip<br/>

Feel free to include my Valley Forge boxes in such as series,<br/>
although as we know no battle was fought there and the boxes<br/>
themselves do not have a particularily historic theme.<br/>
