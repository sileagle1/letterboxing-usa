for this: while boxing in Alabama in July, I got something stuck up into my<br/>
foot. I don't know what it is- maybe a bit of wood or stone. Anyway, hurts<br/>
like the devil. It is so far up in the ball of my foot that it will have to<br/>
be cut out- it is really, really deep. I have crummy insurance, and it will<br/>
be 3 more weeks before I can get in to see a podiatrist, which my insurance<br/>
company says is the person I have to see. My assigned family doctor can't do<br/>
it, and I'm not injured enough to rate a referral to a sports medicine<br/>
surgeon. I was tempted to go to the ER, but I would have to pay a $500<br/>
deductible, unless I were to be admitted. So, if there is a boo boo box,<br/>
maybe I could get it after Sandy......at that point, I'll probably still<br/>
have the boo-boo <laughing crying="" instead="" of=""><br/>
