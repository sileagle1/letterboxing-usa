One of the Nail Boys was at a sleepover birthday party last night <br/>
and I, Nailhead got elected to do pickup duty.  I got the directions <br/>
to the house where the boys had the party and realized that it <br/>
was very near the Woodard Bay Trailhead.  Since DVN3R CKR <br/>
has so tempted me with a great set of clues to her new box at <br/>
the Woodard Bay Nature Trail last night, I thought this would be a <br/>
great little diversion.  I drove out and picked up the said Nail Boy <br/>
along with one of his siblings and Ginger the Dog.  We drove <br/>
directly to the trailhead and got all ready to tackle the box.  Then <br/>
we realized that this particilar trail is off limits to dogs.  No <br/>
problem, I will just lock her in the camper of the truck, I thought.  <br/>
Not a chance!  Once Ginger knows we are going on a hike she <br/>
HAS to come along too, to protect the boys from vicious <br/>
squirrels, of course. <br/>
She actually ripped off the screen from the window and broke it <br/>
out right in the parking lot.  I got mad and scolded her (like that <br/>
really helps, silly how people talk to animals like they understand <br/>
what they are being told).  I then tied her to the spare tire in the <br/>
back of the truck and headed off again.  This time she almost <br/>
hung herself from her leash as she jumped out the broken <br/>
window while still tethered to the tire.  Oh well, theres always the <br/>
Baseball Letterbowl/box at the Chehalis Western Trail just <br/>
across the Woodard Bay Bridge.  We missed that one about a <br/>
month back when it got too dark to finish the 2 box series at that <br/>
location.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, we bagged the baseball box/bowl with Ginger scouting <br/>
squirrels for us and made it back home before Happy Mom go <br/>
suspicious.  Still, I would have liked to get firsties on the new <br/>
box.  Was half hoping to meet other locals like Fudrick or <br/>
Hoopoe out there too, I know how you guys cant pass up a new <br/>
box in our area.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, maybe we could make a little detour on the way home from <br/>
church tomorrow ..hmmm.<br/>
