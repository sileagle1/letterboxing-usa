If the link doesn't work, here's the URL:<br/>

<br/>
Would you assume that this answer would also hold true for letterboxing, since the concepts are so similar?  <br/>
<br/>
Thought this information fits in with the current list thread of placing boxes on gov't land.  Does anyone know if other states have established an official opinion on the subject?<br/>

email form. But I found the answer on their site, so here's the text:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Question What is the DNR's policy about using state lands for playing the <br/>
&gt;new game of geocaching (www.geocaching.com)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Answer The DNR has no problem with individuals playing geocaching on State <br/>
&gt;land, as long as the activity does not become an event with large numbers <br/>
&gt;of players. An event would require a DNR permit and include permit fees. <br/>
&gt;We are especially pleased with the Cache In, Trash Out policy advocated by <br/>
&gt;the official web page www.geocaching.com.<br/>
<br/>
You can go to http://midnr.custhelp.com/ and enter "geocaching" as the <br/>
search text to find the answer page directly.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, I would assume that they're fine with letterboxing, as well.<br/>
