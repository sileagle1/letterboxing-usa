go to read the clues and go back to the list of boxes, i have to <br/>
refresh the page everytime. it didn't do it before, and was wondering <br/>
if it will be fixed in the future? i don't mind doing it, but when i <br/>
read clues only to find the box is missing, it starts to get a bit <br/>
frustrating refreshing all the time. please don't hate me for <br/>
mentioning this.<br/>
