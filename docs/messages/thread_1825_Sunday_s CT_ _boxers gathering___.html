contingent of four representing PA. and N.J. letterboxers enjoyed the <br/>
Drew Clan's "Trout fishing in America" boxes,event boxes,ice cream <br/>
shop box and the "gold rush" stamp exchanges!! I was excited to match <br/>
faces with on-line names and messages but will admitt to being <br/>
greatly disappointed to have missed the Drew Clan..next time..we also <br/>
missed the first two boxes at Lake Compounce which we hunted on our <br/>
way up to Vernon.If you could have seen us on our hands and knees <br/>
digging up the snow for 30min. on the top of the "fish head" you'd <br/>
have had a good laugh!!! We are a determined bunch but snow does make <br/>
a difference! Carol, thanks for the fun games!! The adults were <br/>
alittle slow "coming round" but we all had a blast!! My thanks to one <br/>
and all!! joie and austin christenten aka "see joy" and "lockmaster"<br/>
