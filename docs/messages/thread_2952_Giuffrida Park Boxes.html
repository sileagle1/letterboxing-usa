Meriden, CT. Prior to hunting these boxes, try visiting a really cool site <br/>
for information pertaining to Giuffrida Park. There you can learn about the <br/>
history, land usage, rules and regulations and even take a "virtual hike."<br/>
The site is http://www.ctparks.net/meriden <br/>
<br/>
To get to Giuffrida Park, travel along I-91 either North or South. Take Exit <br/>
20 and proceed West (left off exit from North or left then right from South) <br/>
At this point you will be on Country Club Road. You will drive under a quarry <br/>
conveyor and approx. 1/2 mile after that there will be an entrance to the <br/>
park on your right just at the top of a short steep incline and at a sharp <br/>
left bend in the road. Park in a designated space and check out the map board <br/>
at the dam. There are no maps available but if you took the virtual hike you <br/>
will be familiar with the surroundings somewhat. Allow 20-30 min. to the <br/>
summit and 1 1/2 to 2 hrs for the entire hike. Longer if you gawk at all the <br/>
views. The difficulty is at the beginning of this hike and ends pleasantly <br/>
for which you will be grateful.<br/>
<br/>
Walk below the dam and take the stairs up on the other side. From here the <br/>
trail gets steeper with every step. Stay on the main trail and follow the <br/>
blue arrows to the right. Once arriving at the main rocky wide path, go left <br/>
up and up to the summit called "Cauncey Peak." This climb gains elevation in <br/>
a hurry. Once you get to the top, veer right to the highest point to enjoy <br/>
the view. Look west to Craig's' Castle and the radio towers atop the Hanging <br/>
Hills of Meriden. (Seems there is a legend of a Black Dog out there <br/>
somewhere) To the South there lies the Sleeping Giant who holds many <br/>
letterbox secrets within his grasp. To the Southeast there is Barb and <br/>
Larry's Ledge of which letterboxes are known to sleep awaiting their next <br/>
visitor.<br/>
<br/>
"Chauncey Peak Letterbox"<br/>
Go back to where you first arrived at the top prior to turning right to the <br/>
highest point. Go Northwest on an unmarked trail straight from where you came <br/>
up. Go down a few steps to a small valley. Look along the left side wall for <br/>
a tree that has doubled at its base and then has doubled again at mid point. <br/>
At this tree there is a slab of rock about 6 feet above ground. Hidden way <br/>
back under this slab is the "Cauncey Peak" Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
"Timber Letterbox"<br/>
Continue up the other side of the small valley until you find the blue blazed <br/>
trail. Go left at this point and follow along the ridge for spectacular views <br/>
of  Crescent Lake. Sooner or later you will come upon two trees that have <br/>
been uprooted by wind and have been cut to make way for foot traffic. These <br/>
are located just short of the "Poisoned Hemlock Forest."  Behind one of these <br/>
cut trees you will find the "Timber" Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
"Nosebreaker Letterbox"<br/>
Continuing generally North on the blue trail you will start to go downhill <br/>
fairly quickly. At the second decent, find the red bare-barked dead hemlock <br/>
on the left side of the trail. At its base, there you will find the <br/>
"Nosebreaker" Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Continue down the trail and over the footbridge. At the flat wide trail go <br/>
left and stay generally South until you come to the Pine tree forrest. Go <br/>
left towards the water and enjoy the cool walk among these giants back to <br/>
your car.<br/>
