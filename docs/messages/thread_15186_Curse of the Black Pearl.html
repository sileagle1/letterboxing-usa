Apparently rumor has it that the map that Captain Cavendish made has surfaced somewhere on the PNWLb site at http://www.myndworx.com<br/>
<br/>
This map is a 8x11 sheet or parchment, however there are parts missing.  It is, overall, in bad shape, but people say that Cavendish himself tore up the map to keep it from falling into the hands of Pirates who desperately wanted the Black Pearl.  Apparently the clues needed to find all of the map must also be deciphered.  Apparently Cavendish was being pursued by pirates as he hide the Black Pearl.<br/>
<br/>
Keep tabs on this continuing story ay the PNWLb site!<br/>
