&gt;There's a feature<br/>
&gt;to "moderate", which I thought was basically a yes-or-no option, but<br/>
&gt;it turns out there's a yes, no, and new members only option.  I'm not<br/>
&gt;exactly sure what counts as a "new member" and the help screens are<br/>
&gt;woefully inadequit for answering such simple questions.  After the<br/>
&gt;first post are they no longer a new member?  Or after they've been a<br/>
&gt;member for a month?  I don't have a clue!<br/>
<br/>
I *think* (but, as you say, Yahoo!'s documentation is woefully lacking in <br/>
this section) that a "new member" is anyone who joins the Yahoo! group <br/>
after the administrator turns on the "moderate posts by new members" <br/>
setting. But I don't think there's any provision for making those <br/>
"new"members "old" members -- unless you manually go in and turn off the <br/>
moderation setting and then turn it back on again, which is pretty lame.<br/>
