Today Jay and I decided to try finding the three letterboxes of the <br/>
Massachusetts Mystery series "1a2b"-9072code.  <br/>
<br/>
We got to where we thought the first LB would be and after a quick <br/>
search we found an empty Tupperware box and a ziploc bag.<br/>
<br/>
We persevered and went to where we thought the second box would be <br/>
and we found it.  Jay retrieved the box from under the rock, took out <br/>
the damp logbook and handed it to me.  There was nothing else in the <br/>
box.  I started to flip through the log and saw only three images:  a <br/>
drawing of a swaztika, some male anatomy, and a horrible racial <br/>
slur.  This took about five seconds and then I realized (smelled) <br/>
that the logbook was damp because someone had urinated on it!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
EW, EW, EW, EW, EW!!!  I screamed "Jay, someone peed on it!" and <br/>
dropped it to the ground and proceeded to gag uncontrollably - <br/>
totally thought I was going to throw up!  Jay came to the rescue with <br/>
a box of Wet Ones that we carry in our backpack and we used about 50 <br/>
of them to sanitize our hands.<br/>
<br/>
We left everything like that - we didn't pick up the letterboxing <br/>
stuff because we didn't have anything to carry the gross stuff out, <br/>
but I contacted the Placer and let him know where the stuff was and <br/>
to bring latex gloves to retreive them.<br/>
<br/>
This has been the grossest day of Letterboxing I have ever <br/>
experienced!  Way worse than the time Jay stepped in a huge pile of <br/>
dog poop that a Saint Bernard must have left behind!<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully none of you experience a letterbox like this.  Hopefully <br/>
our next excursion will be very uneventful!<br/>

I can out gross you on this one! I once found a box in Hawaii that<br/>
someone had done #2 on.... then there was that one in Oregon with<br/>
pages and pages of porn hidden in a nearby hidey hole. Oh well, there<br/>
have been scores and scores of wonderful, sanitary ones and they<br/>
outnumber the gross ones by far. Funhog<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  This took about five seconds and then I realized (smelled) <br/>

Jay and Amy,<br/>
<br/>
I thought I was going to pipe in with my own "worst experience ever," <br/>
but I think that one took the cake (and mine was pretty bad, I <br/>
thought).<br/>
<br/>
You have to wonder about the sick level people will sink to <br/>
sometimes.  I hope the profaner of this box was just a random find <br/>
and not someone looking on the site for boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Here's wishing you better boxes ahead!<br/>
