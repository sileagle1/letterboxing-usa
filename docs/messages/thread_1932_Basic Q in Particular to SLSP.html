Giant was still in place.  Has it been serviced since?  I'm planning <br/>
on introducing some newbies to LB, and SL is where I had in mind.  A <br/>
disappointment is not a great intro...I'll avoid it if there is still <br/>
a question.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's OK. I've only visited the Chin and Chest so far anyway. And <br/>
I'll gladly go by those again anytime. I've grown up in the Giant's <br/>
shadow, and never tire of crawling all over the old guy.<br/>
<br/>
I confess that our first time out, we got a little off trail and <br/>
looked for a long time in the wrong area. But then, some other LBers <br/>
showed up and showed us the way.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of friends already went out without us, and they are rather <br/>
inexperienced hikers with small children. They were unsuccessful <br/>
looking for the Grinning Ninny--which is not the easiest box anyway. <br/>
I figured I'll take them out this time, to be sure they aren't <br/>
disappointed again. They need as much encouragement in trail walking <br/>
as LB hunting. <grin><br/>
