<br/>
3 boxes placed on the Chatfield Trail in Killingworth, CT.<br/>
Placed by Bluebird on July 14, 2002.<br/>
Moderate, some challenging, terrain on a one-hour loop through <br/>
beautiful Connecticut woodlands.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: This blue trail begins on Route 80 in Killingworth, CT. <br/>
Parking is 8/10 mile beyond Chestnut Hill Road, on the right, if <br/>
coming in from the 79/80 circle in North Madison. It is well <br/>
marked by a blue oval. The parking and trail will be on your left if <br/>
you come in from the east, from the 81/80 circle in Killingworth. <br/>
In that case it will be just beyond Chatfield Hollow State Park <br/>
(look for treasure there!).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Park by the large rocks and head south on the dirt road. Soon <br/>
you will see the blue trail on your left; take it! You will loop back <br/>
later on the road to this very spot.<br/>
<br/>
Travel down the lovely laurel-lined lane. At the next rock climb, at <br/>
about the 10th rock step (blue rectangle will be straight ahead) <br/>
look to the right. Take 6 steps to the right and find the Rock <br/>
Climb letterbox under the west side of an angled rock. Your first <br/>
box in less than 10 minutes!<br/>
<br/>
Continue up and over the big bald spot, then descend. There will <br/>
be a cute cliff on your right. Next comes a big boulder bonanza <br/>
on the trail. Soon see a tilted rock on our left. Look behind from <br/>
the south to find the Tilted Rock letterbox. Re-hide carefully so it <br/>
is not seen in non-leafy seasons. That took just another 10 <br/>
minutes!<br/>
<br/>
You will see lots of beauty before the third box. Foster's Pond will <br/>
be lingering on the left for a while. You will pass through fern <br/>
frond fields. There will be an area of spindly stick trees. There <br/>
are quaint cliffs to climb and lovely laurel to note. See the boldly <br/>
balanced boulders? Stay on blue. Have fun in the squishy <br/>
squeezes through rock passages.<br/>
<br/>
Continue until the trail comes to a T. Blue goes left; you go right, <br/>
on the unmarked trail (it is fairly wide and road-like in spots). <br/>
Eventually sights and sounds will clue you in that the end is <br/>
near. You will note a blow-down on the left, and a large rock and <br/>
two birch trees (Butterfly, I hope I'm right!) next to it. Look under <br/>
the north edge of the boulder for the Chatfield Loop letterbox. <br/>
Straight on to home! Wasn't that a well-spent hour on this <br/>
Chatfield circuit?<br/>
