We always have room for more letterboxers. There is no proper time to start placing - just jump in - the boxing's fine!<br/>
<br/>
The fact that you are carving already is a plus. We started with bought stamps which we will replace now that I have the carving bug.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

Diane and I started finding letterboxes, and after a few I started to gather materials.  Placement was easy - my town has a small artillery fortification that we were all fixing up.  By the time I'd carved the stamp and placed the box we'd had about twenty finds.<br/>
    I guess it depends upon your level of interest in either aspect of the game!  Some folks get a real kick out of carving stamps, or pointing out great spots to us others (and even Rhode Island seems so much bigger now that we've hiked so much of it), but others prefer the getting out and solving clues.<br/>

I sure hope you don't have to be "seasoned" to place them, because <br/>
I've only found 2 but I've placed 8 so far and have 4 or 5 more to <br/>
place this weekend.  <br/>
<br/>
There is only one in my city placed by someone else, and only one <br/>
other within 30 miles, which I haven't been able to find in 2 <br/>
attempts.<br/>
<br/>
I've not been able to travel to more heavily-boxed areas since I <br/>
started the hobby.  (That was in November.) I made one trip to <br/>
Oakland, CA at Christmas with my family but they are not boxers so I <br/>
only got to search for and find one box.  It may be Spring before I <br/>
get to really go "hunting" but I'm not waiting - I decided it could <br/>
be just as fun to plant as to find.<br/>
<br/>
I've carved about 25 stamps so far, including about a dozen which <br/>
won't go in letterboxes.  I carved them for a a project for teenage <br/>
girls in a juvenile detention center.  We wanted to help them make <br/>
note cards as a Christmas gift for their mothers or grandmothers.  <br/>
Since they are in jail they can't shop and don't have money.  Store-<br/>
bought stamps are expensive, so I volunteered to carve Christmas-<br/>
themed stamps for them.  They were a hit - and great practice for me.<br/>
<br/>
I can testify that practice really improves one carving ability!  My <br/>
first boxes had pretty lame stamps, but they are getting better <br/>
every time.  Even having some luck with letters...<br/>
<br/>
So, plant away!<br/>
