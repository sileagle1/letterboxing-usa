had yesterday in Golden Gate Park! There were nearly 20 boxes planted for <br/>
especially for the event and we had people from as far away as San Luis Obispo <br/>
(Sir B and Jugglermouse graced us with their friendly presence--complete with <br/>
Cheese Racing!!) and Seattle (the infamous Green Tortuga, aka Ryan Carpenter of <br/>
AT fame!). <br/>
<br/>
The overcast weather was a lovely change from the 95 degree heat most of us <br/>
in the Valley have been subjected to, the food was yummy (Mimulus' treacle <br/>
tarts were a treat as were LbNA cakes by Tara!) we were honored to have borrowed <br/>
Just Beth's (from CT) Herbert Hoover stamp as we were next to "his" tree, and <br/>
several HHs were present. Did I mention the fabulous event stamp depicting a <br/>
golden, Golden Gate Bridge on one side and a big pink Heart on the other carved <br/>
by my own, sweet Old Blue?<br/>
<br/>
The attendance list included:<br/>
The Hiker (Lizzardbutt's mom)<br/>
Jetlag and Bookworm<br/>
The Jiggs Family<br/>
Ryan Carpenter<br/>
Carrie and Nate<br/>
The Letterboxspector and his family, Goddess, On The Hunt and Box Hopper<br/>
Mimulus<br/>
Alien Explorers<br/>
Toucan Carol (a TIME newbie)<br/>
NancyAnne and Talkative Doug<br/>
Sierra Sally and Mutau Paul<br/>
Art Diva and Peace Scout<br/>
Cellissimo<br/>
ASQ and Jack <br/>
and our host and hostesses:<br/>
PrincessLea<br/>
Tara<br/>
Paul from S.F.<br/>
Doublesaj &amp; Old Blue                (Hope I didn't miss anyone)<br/>
<br/>
I have photos but will need assistance from someone more computer-literate <br/>
than I to post them--soon, though)<br/>
<br/>
Chalk up another success for Letterboxers everywhere!<br/>
