Thanks for putting the photos and stamps up, but for some reason the<br/>
Cana Island one looks like about half of it got cut off.  Maybe it's<br/>
just my computer doing it, I'll try again later, but do take a look<br/>
yourself if you would.  It should also be noted that the Mink River<br/>
clues start in Sister bay, and that's where the marker is, but the<br/>
actual river (and letterbox) is to the north and east of that town, on<br/>
the other side of the penninsula.<br/>
<br/>
As for terrain for these letterboxes:<br/>
Cave Point - Difficult if not dangerous.<br/>
UWGB - Medium<br/>
Cana Island - Easy, except for a rocky causeway<br/>
Mink River - Easy<br/>
<br/>
For the Dartmoor L-USA walk, all the stamp images for Wisconsin are<br/>
already on the Web, but let me know if there is anything else you<br/>
need.  This is a pretty exciting idea, and if possible we should have<br/>
a sort of stamp gallery of the ones that will be on the walk.<br/>
<br/>
Those images I just sent you are also hand-carved.  Cana Island was my<br/>
first attempt at one.  I actually like doing letters for the stamps,<br/>
because you can start with a kind of blocky font and whittle away to<br/>
get curves going.  I haven't yet tried anything more than an exacto<br/>
knife either, but the dremel tool sounds fascinating.<br/>
