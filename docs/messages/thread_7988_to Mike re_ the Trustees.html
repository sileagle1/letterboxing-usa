<div>Mike,</div>
<div>When I planted Native Son Bernard Doyle at Pierce Park in 
Leominster I contacted the head of the Trustees location in Leominster to see if 
it could be okay.  He thought it sounded great and even gave me the idea of 
dedicating the box to Bernard Doyle (I was originally thinking of dedicating it 
to the Tapioca King).  I didn't seek permission to plant the one at 
Bear's Den but I think it's under the same jurisdiction as Leominster so, 
hopefully, it's okay too.</div>

<div><b>Subject:</b> Re: [LbNA] Re: Recent National 
  Park Service "rule"</div>
<div><br/></div>Greetings, <br/><br/>On 
  the subject of hunting, the NPS requires special permits for the right to hunt 
  their land. Since they have an economic interest, banning the practice would 
  be detrimental to them. This is above and beyond the licences that hunters and 
  fisherman need from the state in which they live. <br/><br/>As for National 
  Monuments, I am currently working with the Springfield Armory, which is run by 
  the Park Service, to get permission to place two boxes on their property. One 
  will be inside the old armory building itself, the other out on the grounds. I 
  think we must try to engage the people that actually work at these sites, and 
  get permission on a case by case basis. If we can do this, and show that we 
  are responsible folks who are an asset to the park system, we'll have a better 
  chance of getting this ban overturned. <br/><br/>Incidentally, does anyone know 
  where this official policy is recorded? <br/><br/>As a final question, to those 
  of us in the Massachusetts area, does anyone know if the Trustees of the 
  Reservations have an official policy regarding letterboxes? I know we've 
  already planted on some of their reservations (I've done one myself), but now 
  I'm wondering if we'll have this problem with them as well. <br/><br/>Mike S.
