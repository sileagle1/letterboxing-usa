                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just an FYI...  I closed out the location poll since today.  The <br/>
votes are spread, but it does seem that most people would prefer a <br/>
central location to alternating regions from year-to-year.  On the <br/>
other hand, a lot of people said they would try to make it either <br/>
way...  Considering the areas that have expressed interest in coming <br/>
(Chicago, Cleveland, all areas of MI), Ann Arbor/Jackson is centrally <br/>
located to all, and would be about 3.5 hours from the outer edges. <br/>
<br/>
I liked Ruthann's suggestion about Hudson Mills MetroPark as a <br/>
central location, but am wondering about the size of the park?  I was <br/>
there last fall, looking for the April Fool's box and it didn't <br/>
appear the park was very large.  Of course, I stopped only to find <br/>
the box and made a beeline in the direction of the clues from the <br/>
parking area, so I could have missed a lot...  Just wanting to make <br/>
sure there will be ample space for hiding boxes.  Also...  was there <br/>
a shelter of any kind there?  <br/>
<br/>
I am not real familiar with the Ann Arbor/Jackson area, so any other <br/>
suggestions as to location would be welcome.<br/>
<br/>
And just to reiterate, or in case you missed the earlier message -- <br/>
the date is Saturday, May 31, 2003.  Mark it on your calendars!<br/>
<br/>
Within the next week or so I will be creating a web page for details <br/>
and information about the gathering as we go forward...  If you have <br/>
any ideas or suggestions about activities, etc., please don't <br/>
hesitate to speak up!<br/>

</p><p>Thanks. If camping is not available, I do live close enough to return home after a day of events at the Gathering. I hope to be able to come with my 8-year-old Golden Tristcuit and my Leader Dogs for the Blind puppy, a Golden named Dewar who will be about 7 months old in May.
