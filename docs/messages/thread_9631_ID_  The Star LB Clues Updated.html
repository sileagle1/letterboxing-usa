Please replace THE STAR LETTERBOX clues with the<br/>
following as we checked the box the other day and it<br/>
was missing.  So here are the new clues for the new<br/>
box.  Thanks so much.  =-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Star Letterbox <br/>
<br/>
Placed by A-bear (jedaryn02@yahoo.com) on 10 December<br/>
2002 <br/>
Star, ID <br/>
Ada County <br/>
<br/>
Directions: Off of Highway 44 at the Star MERC head<br/>
south on Main St to the southern most point where you<br/>
can park on the dirt near some large boulders. You<br/>
will be able to see a rope swing and a bridge from the<br/>
parking spots.<br/>
<br/>
Description: Easy walking or you can float down the<br/>
river for this letterbox. If you choose to float to<br/>
this box, beware of the rapids along the way (they're<br/>
bordered by concrete structures and large rocks so you<br/>
probably want to exit RIGHT before them).<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Swing off the rope swing and float to the<br/>
bridge or walk from the rope swing in search of the<br/>
three large water turn keys. Continue West on<br/>
whichever trail you want and under the bridge (beware<br/>
of all the cobwebs). Under the Northwest side of the<br/>
bridge there is a small opening under the concrete<br/>
with more spider webs hiding the STAR letterbox. <br/>
Actually I had to replace it since its no longer<br/>
there.  From that spot head west about 10 paces<br/>
(pace=2 steps) where youll find three big trees<br/>
intertwined together with a fourth tree fallen in the<br/>
river.  Inside those trees on the west side youll<br/>
find what youre looking for.  <br/>
<br/>
Please replace the sticks and leaves to hide the<br/>
letterbox out of sight. Go back to the rope swing and<br/>
hang out with the locals swinging into the refreshing<br/>
Boise River, one of our favorite hangouts.  Of course<br/>
it snowed today so you might want to wait until summer<br/>
to opt for the rope swing route. <br/>
