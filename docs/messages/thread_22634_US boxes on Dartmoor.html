                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just returned from our Dartmoor/Scotland trip and I told Andy <br/>
that I would post an update on the US boxes that Catbead sent him <br/>
some time ago. Before that I wanted to let everyone know that Andy <br/>
was super, he spent two days with us cruising several of the tors, <br/>
and added to our experiences tremendously. If anyone has an <br/>
opportunity to go to Dartmoor don't hesitate,and I wouldn't hesitate <br/>
to contact him before going.<br/>
Back to the planting of US boxes. Andy is still trying to finish <br/>
some schooling so while the stamps have been registered, they <br/>
haven't been planted. He doesn't want to plant them in easy to find <br/>
locations as he is worried that they could go missing. When the <br/>
project was proposed originally, I think Andy thought he might get <br/>
up to 4 or 5 stamps to plant, but I think the total increased to a <br/>
more daunting number.<br/>
 If you were one of the carvers that submitted a stamp, just give <br/>
him some time and it should get planted when he finds time.<br/>
<br/>
If you are planning a Dartmoor trip try to fit in a good amount of <br/>
time in Scotland also. You won't be disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, it was rather cool to stamp in after the Bakers Dozen had <br/>
already put their mark down.<br/>
