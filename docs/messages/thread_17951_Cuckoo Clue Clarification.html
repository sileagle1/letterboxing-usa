One, from the Letterboxer's Companion by Randy Hall, says that a cuckoo clue<br/>
travels from box to box like a hitch hiker.<br/>
<br/>
The definition on Silent Doug's website says:  A clue to a secret letterbox<br/>
that's only found inside another letterbox, usually in the same general<br/>
location. A cuckoo clue is not published on the Web, and is not to be<br/>
publicly discussed. Also known as a bonus box.<br/>

Hello people...I haven't discussed where I was when I discovered this <br/>
Cuckoo Clue!! My weekend consists of Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I <br/>
was boxing in three different areas this past weekend with a <br/>
geographical spread between them of over 150 miles!! I never <br/>
mentioned the area where I found it nor where it was leading to. <br/>
<br/>
HEck...I"m assuming that it was a Cuckoo clue and it may really be a <br/>
bonus box clue since I've never seen one of them either. I had <br/>
already refered to the LEtterboxing.org website before posting my <br/>
question. <br/>
<br/>
I'm just looking for clarification as to what constitues a cuckoo <br/>
clue and whether or not it can be limited to a specific area. If I <br/>
cannot ask a question (in general) online about cuckoo clues and how <br/>
they work or what constitutes a cuckoo clue then what is the point of <br/>
asking for help! I'm not quoting a cuckoo clue, I'm not revealing <br/>
where a cuckoo clue can be found and I'm not telling where the <br/>
resulting box could be found! Because ....GUESS WHAT!! I don't know <br/>
those things! I left the clue (whatever kind it may be) in the box <br/>
where I found it!!<br/>
<br/>
I'M ASKING ABOUT THEM BECAUSE I'M CONSIDERING CREATING A CUCKOO CLUE!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh and thanks to the two people who tried to help me without <br/>
reprimanding me for bringing up the subject in general!<br/>

site, the book "The Letterboxer's Companion", Silent <br/>
Doug's website and many others have done before you.   <br/>

the others have posted:<br/>

-"A Folder of Useful Information" by Spring Chick:<br/>

If the e-mail had been "help with a Cuckoo" or "Cuckoo <br/>
Question", then I'm sure the list would have been flooded with <br/>
helpful replies. But there was a potential spoiler in that someone <br/>
mentioned that they found a Cuckoo and mainly people <br/>
responed so that the clue wouldn't be spoiled. <br/>
<br/>
I can't attest for off-site remarks though, and it might have been <br/>
nasty. I just wanted to point out that Cuckoo clues shouldn't be <br/>
discussed on the list, here are some sites to check out to <br/>
educate yourself on the process, and that's it.<br/>
<br/>
People can be confrontational on the list, but that doesn't mean <br/>
everyone is out to get someone.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I sure wish I'd find a Cuckoo clue once in a while.<br/>

Have fun,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just in case you never received a straight answer to your question <br/>
here is what I understand about Cuckoo Clues.<br/>
<br/>
Someone hides a box and does not post the clues in a normal <br/>
fashion.  Instead they write up a set of clues and hide them in <br/>
another box, somewhere on the web, anywhere where another <br/>
letterboxer could stumble upon the clue.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is that the cuckoo clue travels from box to box or from <br/>
letterboxer to letterboxer but the cuckoo box remains planted in the <br/>
same place.  We found it helpful to actually explain the rules about <br/>
Cuckoo Boxes on our Cuckoo Clue so that people would know what to <br/>
do.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess it is possible for a Cuckoo Box to move as well but each <br/>
person who moves it would need to release a new set of clues.  I <br/>
would not pursue this course of action unless you receive permission <br/>
from the original placer.  It is possible that this is the intent of <br/>
some Cuckoo Boxes but if those instructions are not explicitly <br/>
listed with the box then don't move it. <br/>
<br/>
I am sorry that you had to go through so much crap to get this <br/>
answer.  This list tends to over react sometimes.  I find that being <br/>
extremely sarcastic, slightly off-kilter, and strange beyond belief <br/>
helps me cope with the rudeness that pervades this site at times.  <br/>
My philosophy has always been to listen to the rules and then <br/>
completely ignore them.  I encourage you to subvert and flout the <br/>
rules with mocking disdain.  <br/>

&gt; Normally I don't take exception to replies but I am with this <br/>
thread.<br/>

&gt; Several people have emailed me offlist..one was helpful and the <br/>
rest <br/>
&gt; have pointedly told me that this is not to be discussed online! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello people...I haven't discussed where I was when I discovered <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; Cuckoo Clue!! My weekend consists of Friday, Saturday and Sunday. <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; was boxing in three different areas this past weekend with a <br/>
&gt; geographical spread between them of over 150 miles!! I never <br/>
&gt; mentioned the area where I found it nor where it was leading to. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; HEck...I"m assuming that it was a Cuckoo clue and it may really be <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; bonus box clue since I've never seen one of them either. I had <br/>
&gt; already refered to the LEtterboxing.org website before posting my <br/>
&gt; question. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm just looking for clarification as to what constitues a cuckoo <br/>
&gt; clue and whether or not it can be limited to a specific area. If I <br/>
&gt; cannot ask a question (in general) online about cuckoo clues and <br/>
how <br/>
&gt; they work or what constitutes a cuckoo clue then what is the point <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; asking for help! I'm not quoting a cuckoo clue, I'm not revealing <br/>
&gt; where a cuckoo clue can be found and I'm not telling where the <br/>
&gt; resulting box could be found! Because ....GUESS WHAT!! I don't <br/>
know <br/>
&gt; those things! I left the clue (whatever kind it may be) in the box <br/>
&gt; where I found it!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'M ASKING ABOUT THEM BECAUSE I'M CONSIDERING CREATING A CUCKOO <br/>
CLUE!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh and thanks to the two people who tried to help me without <br/>
&gt; reprimanding me for bringing up the subject in general!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Til next time,<br/>
&gt; (That is if I still have any head to lop off)<br/>

&gt; &gt; OKay..we found our first Cuckoo Clue this past weekend. Of <br/>
course <br/>
&gt; we <br/>
&gt; &gt; didn't have time to decipher it and hunt the box down. I need a <br/>
&gt; &gt; clarification on cuckoo clues.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Do they stay in the box that they are found in? Can a cuckoo <br/>
clue <br/>
&gt; be <br/>
&gt; &gt; confined to staying in boxes within a set area? <br/>
