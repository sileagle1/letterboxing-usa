We  really appreciate everyone coming out. It added a great dimension <br/>

   Our club has been asked to  display our booth and do public <br/>
demonstrations at the Big E ( New England State Fair ) in Sept. We <br/>
will be there on the 27 th and 30 th  in the 4-H building. More <br/>
details to follow.  Imagine how many new letterboxers we can  enlist <br/>
at that fair! <br/>
   Thanks to Bill and Val at letterboxing  central for bringing <br/>
goodies to share, for taking pictures to share, and for sharing their <br/>
enthusiasm at the fair. <br/>
  Human Travellers  were a fun addition to our boxes. Anyone running <br/>
an event, this makes a great mixer with questions and clues to a <br/>
particular person. So everyone was assuming the travellers date was <br/>
human and named Tammy were pleasantly suprised to find her to be a <br/>
Jersy Calf! The Cowboy enjoyed his notoriety during the fair. When <br/>
successful with the clues they would ask him " Are you with Tammy?" <br/>
He would bashfully pull a packet from his pocket and stamp the <br/>
recipients book. <br/>
  Thanks again to everyone   Leader of the pack _ All tired out!<br/>

Hello there 4-H Eventers..<br/>
<br/>
Where are all the pics of the event then ? <big grin=""><br/>
<br/>
I want to see the first letterboxing Jersey Calf ! <br/>
<br/>
I know one Dartmoorian who took his pet Chicken (Rooster) with him<br/>
letterboxing..on a lead ....but he was exceptionally eccentric....<br/>
<br/>
Another I know takes his pet toad in an nice damp box !  (much easier to<br/>
carry and makes a dandy foot print in the visitors books! )<br/>
<br/>
But a cow ..now that is a big beastie...must take up most of the back seat<br/>
in the BMW I guess !<br/>
<br/>
How do you get her in the rucksack ?<br/>
<br/>
<lol><br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Carol,  We had a great time at the fair!  Not only adding more finds to<br/>
our count than we have done the whole summer, but the fair itself was the<br/>
best one I've been to in years.  It didn't cost an arm and a leg to get<br/>
in, and all the food purchased was for some type of fund raising<br/>
organization.  It looked like you had a good turnout, I hope everyone<br/>
made out well.  My kids loved the pigs, and got to pet some cows, even<br/>
Tammy.  The human boxes were a great twist..."you can't yell at me I'm a<br/>
volunteer". <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the effort you put into this event, it was great.  <br/>
