the wonder beagle &amp; I went out to check the Bethany Lake bunch of<br/>
l-boxes since we may get a visit from across the state this week.  2 of<br/>
the 4 are gone without a trace.  One of mine &amp; one of Mitch's.  I called<br/>
&amp; left word with him and have since received e-mail acknowledging.<br/>
<br/>
Not bucking for pity here, Mitch has several other boxes out there &amp; I<br/>
still have 3 left (big assumption, Brown's camp is undoubtedly under<br/>
quite a bit of snow right now).<br/>
<br/>
So, being the stalwart l-box pioneers that we are, we will tough this<br/>
out &amp; hustle to replace the missing boxes ASAP.  A good opportunity to<br/>
carve a new stamp, although the logbook in RC#1 had Dan'l's stamp &amp;<br/>
comments and will be missed.<br/>

But you know what they say... You can't keep a Madman down!!<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to whip up another stamp and put it exactly where it was before.<br/>
If that one comes up missing... I'll replace it again.<br/>
And again.  And again.  And again.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, the little punk will either grow bored with the whole thing or<br/>
grow up!!<br/>
<br/>
They don't call me Der MAD Stamper for nothing.<br/>
<br/>
(PS -- the new stamp may not be EXACTLY like the original.  I know at least<br/>
six people collected the limited first edition, and I want it to be obvious<br/>
which is which)<br/>

right... I can afford a few more containers &amp; my stamp carving can use<br/>
further perfection anyway.  Have an idea for a new stamp for Rock Creek<br/>
#1... too bad the Craft store isn't an all-nighter.... need some<br/>
erasers......<br/>

I always keep a cellar full of both Red and White...<br/>
White goes nicely with waterfowl,<br/>
But I prefer Red with raccoon.<br/>
<br/>
(inside joke, in reference to the design/material of missing stamps)<br/>
<br/>
PS - Actually, I've been known to make midnight runs to the 24-hr Rite Aid<br/>
school supply aisle.  No jumbos, but I don't mind glueing several small ones<br/>
to a block of wood.  They also have a copy machine (and polish remover, and<br/>
rubber cement).  When inspiration hits, there will be little sleep until the<br/>
MADsterpiece is completed!!!<br/>
