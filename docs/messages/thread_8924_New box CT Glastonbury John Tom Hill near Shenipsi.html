                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Actually had the chance to place a box even though<br/>
work has taken over my life.<br/>
Placed: Oct 25th? By John and Jen of Hebron.<br/>
liberumarbitrium@yahoo.com<br/>
Town: Glastonbury, John Tom Hill.  <br/>
County: Hartford<br/>
Time: 20-30 minutes one-way.<br/>
Difficulty: My knees are shot, so for me I'll say<br/>
moderate, otherwise, not that bad. It is hilly.<br/>
Features: Awesome view or two if you have a map of the<br/>
Shenipsit trail.<br/>
Directions: Get to Birch Mountain Road in Glastonbury,<br/>
off of Route 94\Hebron Avenue.<br/>
<br/>
Once on Birch Mountain Road drive maybe a mile and<br/>
you'll pass under a set of power lines.<br/>
<br/>
Continue past the power lines for a short distance and<br/>
on the left (East) side of the road you'll see several<br/>
large boulders  blocking the entrance to the trail and<br/>
enough room to park. Park there.<br/>
<br/>
(FYI-Across the street is a trailhead to Gay City<br/>
State Park.)<br/>
<br/>
All directions (i.e. north , south, etc. are<br/>
approximate)<br/>
-Go up the stone steps, cross a dirt road, enter the<br/>
woods.<br/>
-After a short distance youll come to a fork of the<br/>
BLUE\WHITE trail, which is marked on the trees. GO<br/>
RIGHT (North).<br/>
-Continue on the trail and walk over rock outcroppings<br/>
as you descend.<br/>
-Youll bottom out in a cool little valley and pass a<br/>
huge oak on the left (East).<br/>
-The trail will take an obvious turn to the right<br/>
(West) as you ascend then it cuts left (North) up a<br/>
rock outcrop.<br/>
-Keep on truckin on a modest overgrown ridge line and<br/>
you will come to the vista. You can see Hartford.<br/>
-Relax<br/>
-Continue past the vista for a short distance and<br/>
youll come to what appears to be a small outcropping<br/>
of rock the trail cuts through.<br/>
-There will be a tree in the dead center of the trail<br/>
just before you descend (a natural step) and it is<br/>
marked with the BLUE\WHITE trail marker. <br/>
-Walk up to the tree and stand about a foot away<br/>
facing it. Look about 90 degrees to your left away<br/>
from the tree and youll see two small fallen trees.<br/>
-One of the fallen trees is a white birch and both<br/>
fallen trees are side-by-side and small in diameter.<br/>
They point towards the box.<br/>
-Both fallen trees are fairly short. Follow them up<br/>
the side of the ledge and at the end of these two<br/>
fallen trees youll find a small pile of foot long<br/>
birch and other tree branches covering a large flat<br/>
rock.<br/>
-Lift the rock and score the box.<br/>
-Turn back and head home OR: If you had the<br/>
Connecticut Walk Book you could make a loop and see<br/>
another vista and ultimately arrive back at the<br/>
original start point. It would be under the Shenipsit<br/>
trail section. DO NOT ATTEMPT without the book, there<br/>
are several trails that run through here.<br/>
