It was such a beautiful warm day here in RI. My whole family had a <br/>
blast as we searched and found all 5 boxes we had set out to find <br/>
that afternoon. We found 2 mystery boxes!!! And had just missed a hh <br/>
a couple of days before at one box.<br/>
Since finding out about LB's I have gotten 2 friends and my in-laws <br/>
involved. <br/>
I planned on spending my mother's day out lb'ing but the weather is <br/>
not cooperating. <br/>
