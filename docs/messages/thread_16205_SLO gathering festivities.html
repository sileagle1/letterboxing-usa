attempt to reach SLO before the Great SLO Gathering.  As much as I'd <br/>
love to have visited all you folks at Cape Cod, but hey, the first <br/>
annual letterboxing gathering in my hometown?  Nope, I couldn't miss <br/>
that....<br/>
<br/>
So I found myself Friday morning, packing up all my worldly <br/>
possessions, running through the Boston subways, to the airport.  <br/>
First flew to Philly, where I met up briefly with Amanda from <br/>
Seattle.  (And, despite finding her, while she was at WORK!, I didn't <br/>
get her "working letterbox" stamp!  *shaking head*)  Then I dashed <br/>
off to another plane headed to LAX.  After landing there, I browsed <br/>
around in the bookstore reading selected passages from A Walk In the <br/>
Woods and a few hours later, wouldn't you know it, I bumped into <br/>
Amanda again.  Bizarre coincidence, if you ask me.  =)<br/>
<br/>
As it was getting late, we were on east coast time, and tired, we <br/>
slept a few hours at a hotel before driving up to SLO the next <br/>
morning, arriving in town a mere 20 minutes before the letterboxing <br/>
festivities were to begin.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Everyone seemed quite shocked to learn I was there--mostly since I <br/>
didn't tell anyone and they assumed I'd be at the Cape Cod gathering <br/>
instead.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the times we had....  I don't know if anyone made an official <br/>
count of how many boxers showed up, but it seemed like hundreds.  Or <br/>
at least a couple of dozen.  =)  We laughed, we told stories, <br/>
exchanged stamps.  A few presidents visited, sent by Just Beth, and I <br/>
got to say, "Yeah, I met Just Beth once upon a time in my younger <br/>
years.  Interesting and classy lady....  The woman that made the <br/>
presidents possible."  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
A couple hours later, we broke up into groups to hunt down the <br/>
letterboxes hidden within the park.  Oh, the stamps that we found!  <br/>
Beautiful carvings!  At times, twisted and wicked clues!  The fun <br/>
didn't end until hours later, when we were tired and sunburnt on this <br/>
beautiful, sunny day.<br/>
<br/>
After the official gathering, Amanda from Seattle, Princess Lea, and <br/>
I went off to eat dinner then hunted down a few more drive-by boxes <br/>
around town before calling an end to our day and breaking up.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a great time, everyone!  And a special thanks to Sir B, <br/>
Juggler Mouse, and anyone else that helped to organize the event!  <br/>
You did a great job!  =)<br/>
