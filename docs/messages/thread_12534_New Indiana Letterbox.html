<br/>
We have just recently discovered letterboxing and this is our first <br/>
letterbox placement--done when visiting family nearby and introducing <br/>
them to our new hobby.  Even though it is far from our California home, <br/>
we will be able to check it several times a year.<br/>
<br/>
Name of Letterbox...Our Indiana Letterbox<br/>
Placed...April 29, 2003<br/>
Place...Indiana--Hendricks County<br/>
Nearest Town...Plainfield<br/>
<br/>
This is a pleasant and easy 20 to 30-minute walk along a wide, paved <br/>
trail.  It is a popular place to bicycle, jog and walk the dog.,  In <br/>
the spring we enjoyed wildflowers, the rippling sounds of the creek, <br/>
trees bursting into purple bloom and the songs of many birds.  In the <br/>
creek we spotted magnificent Canadian geese as well as several <br/>
fishermen.<br/>
<br/>
Plainfield, IN....From the intersection of US40 and Center Street, <br/>
proceed south on Center.  Pass the old library and count 27 houses on <br/>
the right.  Turn right and park in the lot at Friendship Gardens.  <br/>
<br/>
Go to White Lick Creek Trail.  Walk over the green bridge and turn <br/>
right when you see the circle inside of a circle.  Continue on, passing <br/>
a large mound of white/gray rock on the right.  Walk to the bridge <br/>
ahead and go under it.  Stop and take time to read the Historic <br/>
National Road marker on the right.  Pass a pond on the left.  The trail <br/>
goes over a drain with white/gray rock on both sides.  Where the trail <br/>
curves, you'll find a lone tree next to the trail before the wide, open <br/>
space.  Make a 90-degree turn to the left.  You will see two tall trees <br/>
with a curvy tree in between them.  The object of your search is <br/>
concealed by rocks behind the tree on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Please be very discreet when retrieving the box and doing your stamping <br/>
as this trail can be quite busy at certain times.  Also, please <br/>
remember to observe all the usual cautions for your safety.<br/>
<br/>
We would love to hear from you when you find this box!<br/>
