<br/>
I have recently created a newsgroup for LetterBoxes that have been <br/>
planted around the world. I know on the LBNA site, on many <br/>
occasions, poeple have asked if there are any LetterBoxes in <br/>
foreign countries. I have never really found anything definitive <br/>
on this. Hence, I have created a list and website to inform people <br/>
of various LetterBoxes throughout the world. I would like to <br/>
invite everyone to join the list, so that we can spread the <br/>
LetterBoxing bug to other parts of the world!<br/>

"This list was created to be an outlet to spread the sport of <br/>
LetterBoxing to all corners of the globe. LetterBoxing started in <br/>
Dartmoor, England in the mid 1800's, moved to the USA in 1998, and <br/>
will hopefully continue to spread around the world. I invite you <br/>
to use this forum to spark your artisitc side, test your stamina <br/>
for the outdoors, and enjoy nature as mother nature intended us <br/>
to. "<br/>
