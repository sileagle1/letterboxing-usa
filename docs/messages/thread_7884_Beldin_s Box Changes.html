                    <html><body>Beldin I awoke with a start.  Confused, he shook his head as if to loosen the cobwebs.  "I feel so strange.  As though I'm not quite myself", he thought.  Then he remembered the spell he had cast to split his self in two.  "That is never a good idea, he scolded himself.  You'd think I'd learn from past experience.  Ah, well.  The deed is done.  Now where did that other half get to?  We can't have two of me walking around here.  I might confuse the wild life."  And so he set out to find his other half.  Backtracking to the trail, he headed back to the beach to which he had teleported.  Once at the beach he took the dirt trail north west of the beach.  This trail merges with a gravel trail with green and gold blazes.  Beldin followed the trail in a south-south westerly direction to where it forked   with a dirt trail.  Follow the dirt trail back to the bridges of three.  20 paces past the third bridge, then look to the right.  Find the tree of three.  "Perhaps my other half has taken all the sense with him, because I am no closer to finding my other half than when I was sleeping.  I will rest here and ponder on where he may be."</body></html>
