                    <html><body>Greetings!
<br/>
<br/>With a few spare hours before having to go to work yesterday, we went to Suffield CT to bag a couple boxes. 
<br/>
<br/>The Out of This World letterbox was easy to find. The logbook was damp, and some pages were damaged. Considering that it has only been in the field for less than a month, we were sorry to see it damaged already. We dried it off as best we could before rehiding it. 
<br/>
<br/>We also stopped by the Winter Gathering letterbox as well. This box is a drive by, but it wasn't easy to get in and out without attracting a lot of attention, as it is in a very busy public area. In fact, there was an entry in the logbook from someone who just happened to find the box earlier this summer, so he signed the book. No damage to the logbook, but the stamp could stand to be replaced.
<br/>
<br/>We also picked up our third hitch hiker, The One Ring. We are now faced with a very important question: Do we take it with us to Maine next week, or drop it off again nearby? 
<br/>
<br/>Decisions, decisions......
