Question for you...<br/>
<br/>
Will attendees to the gathering be able to stamp their personal logs <br/>
with the stamps from the PLB as well?  Also, are 'secret traveling <br/>
stamps' allowed for stamping in?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; As previously announced, this PLB list was to close today (I'm back <br/>
&gt; home from Denver CO)  However, since it was requested that I bring <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; to the Jul 9-10-11 gather, Bucks County PA, before mailing I think <br/>
&gt; that made the list a little shorter than usual - only 19 requests.  <br/>
&gt; So I will leave the list open until Jul 11 and the PLB will arrive <br/>
&gt; with a lot of stamp-ins to make it interesting for the first on the <br/>
&gt; list (Mr. High Point NC).<br/>

YES - attendees will be treated as mailees - for this my very first <br/>
PLB -- then I'll see what kinda mess I've gotten myself into before I <br/>
agree to that again %^)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Also, are 'secret traveling stamps' allowed for stamping in?<br/>

WILL it still be a secret?  IF you can get away with it, I'm not the <br/>
one that will be stopping you.  Although I don't know if I'll be <br/>
wanting anyone taking Martha (or Mr. PotatoHead) off into the woods <br/>
to be alone with her (or Him).<br/>
