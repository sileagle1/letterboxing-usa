Wanda &amp; pete have done for Hitchhikers.  You can get up to<br/>
15 MB free space at geocities.yahoo.com, where my web site<br/>
is located.  The problem now is how to identify which boxes<br/>
are missing, since they no longer say Abandoned on the new<br/>
site (they are just gone), and it would be difficult to<br/>
compare the new list with the old one.  If nobody else<br/>
volunteers to do this, I could try if I get the time, but<br/>
without a list of Abandoned boxes I'm afraid it would be<br/>
a challenging task.  Better yet, maybe Steve Rayvenhaus could<br/>
add them to his database?<br/>

  What if several different people worked on this....each doing 1 state or area.  And then sent them<br/>
  by email to whomever will be doing the website.  I could easily do Colorado (of course we dont have<br/>
  as many boxes as many other states do)...  Dont you just look on the old site and if it isnt on the new one<br/>
  then those are your boxes?<br/>

<br/>
It would be a long process in some states to weed out the truly<br/>
missing, but the only way to know for sure is to go and look as<br/>
Lisa/TDG suggests.<br/>

Steve, since you're already set up and are willing to do this....<br/>

most of my surrounding area will be easy because we were <br/>
careful to make sure no boxes went unclaimed in our area and <br/>
it's surrounding states.  I could double check, just to be sure,  I'm <br/>
