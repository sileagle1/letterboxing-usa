I'm so glad that you stepped in and posted that eloquent response to<br/>
Jay Drew's comment and the ensuing frenzy. I posted the brief reply<br/>
yesterday at least alluding to the fact that there was more going on<br/>
than met the eye. I should have known that it would be of little use.<br/>
At least one person had the courtesy to ask the circumstances. The<br/>
rest of the group, mob?, as expected began lecturing and condemning<br/>
the placer without knowing any of the particulars.<br/>
<br/>
This morning, I decided to check and see if that comment had quietly<br/>
slipped to the next page or become another big board brouhaha. As I<br/>
read through the responses, I realized that something more should be<br/>
said; some explanation or clarification. I was glad to see that you'd<br/>
stepped in and taken care of the matter. OK, it saved me from having<br/>
to do it. I hate to post over there as much as you do.<br/>
