They may have received a report or two where someone could not find it and they decided the reporting boxer(s) were somewhat reliable sources and the owner hasn't had a chance to go look for themselves. So they may temporarily marked it as unknown.<br/>
<br/>
Another possibility is the box may not have been found in a long time (or ever) and again the owner hasn't had time or an opportunity to go check on it.<br/>

What if they only live three miles from their box? Would there be another<br/>
reason for placing an unknown status on it??? I guess I should have been<br/>
more specific with my original question, but it was very early in the<br/>
