your 1st letterbox or your 100th<br/>
a find in which you fell off a cliff <br/>
met another boxer. <br/>
found a really prestigous box, etc.<br/>
Finding the box itself is expected and therefore not that interesting, but <br/>
finding a huge orange mushroom or a dead gerbil might be.  Not finding a box <br/>
might be of interest (at least there was some adventure).  Funny reparte is <br/>
usually OK.  However, if you posted every find, especially if you find lots, I <br/>
would most likely just skip those messages as too pedantic. <br/>
<br/>
Off Limits (IMHO)<br/>
any discussion of mystery boxes, where to find certain hitchhikers, cukoos, <br/>
or other hints on the list that do not come from the placer, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Individuals are easy to contact.  The email address appears at the top of <br/>
every post.  The new contact the placer feature at the top of the clues makes it <br/>
a cinch for you to go directly to the source.  Many of the posts (MIA, status <br/>
reports, etc) could be rerouted in a more effective manner.<br/>
<br/>
I do not generally read the laundry lists of sitreps.  I do not generally <br/>
read most of the list anymore.  I get my mail in digest and scan it for messages <br/>
in which I'd be interested.  However, if I didn't have to wade through 200 <br/>
messages to find 1 or 2 of interest.  So, I would be grateful if someone created <br/>
a new list for sitreps.  That way you all could have your cake, just leave me <br/>
the ice cream.<br/>

&gt; I came back from my first boxing excursion today, eager to tell <br/>
&gt; about it, but I see from posts while I was gone that that is <br/>
&gt; probably not a good idea either. Goodness, will someone please let <br/>
&gt; me know exactly WHAT is okay to post here????? And if anything in my <br/>
&gt; previous (what... 8 or so????) posts was objectionable, please copy <br/>
&gt; it and email it to me, so I will know.<br/>
