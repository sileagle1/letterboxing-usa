me this afternoon!  It's certainly been the largest single turnout <br/>
on my behalf--so far.  But I'm sure the overwhelming Vermont <br/>
letterboxers can do better than that.  Right, Vermonters?  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
It was great meeting all of you crazy Connecticut people, despite <br/>
what we say on the Pacific Northwest board.  =)  And it was <br/>
wonderful meeting all those folks that met me on other days to take <br/>
me letterboxing or give me a shower to clean up with or whatever the <br/>
case may be!  Thank you to everyone!  I'll have to replace my <br/>
logbook soon with a new one with all the new exchanges I've gotten <br/>
in Connecticut.<br/>

Do you have any idea what your progress through MA, VT<br/>
and NH is going to be like? We'd love to meet and do<br/>
an exchange with you if possible. Unfortunately, my<br/>
"weekends" are Mondays and Tuesdays, which is why we<br/>
didn't come to the CT meeting today. We live near<br/>
Springfield, MA, and getting to various points along<br/>
the AT is relatively simple. Thanks, and happy hiking!<br/>
<br/>

I figure I'll hit MA on or by Wednesday.  After that, it'll probably <br/>
take a week or so to get through each of those three states--roughly <br/>
speaking.  I'll try to send updates about where I am once or twice a <br/>
week to this board, but anyone wanting to meet me should e-mail me <br/>
directly since I won't be able to read this board most of the time.<br/>
