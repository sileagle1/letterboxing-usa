Ad Astra; a new letterbox clue<br/>
Placed 12/28/01<br/>
By: Bayboxer and TCR<br/>
Location: NY; Macedon;  Wayne County; Canal Park<br/>
Difficulty: easy  Pace=1 step for long legs.<br/>
Cautions: Poison ivy, open water (watch young children along canal)<br/>
Time: short walk to clue, many miles of available trails for your use.<br/>
<br/>
Drive SR31 to SR 350 north to Canal Park. Parking by fire station, and<br/>
walk to lock 30.<br/>
<br/>
Take the towpath along the north side. Stop and view the display about<br/>
the canal. Put yourself back in 1835. It is a beautiful summer's night. A<br/>
boat is tied up for the night. The stars shine brightly and a full moon<br/>
casts shadows over the woods and farmlands.  A young lad named Thomas<br/>
jumps off the boat to shore to stretch and walk a little. Looking up he<br/>
sees ruddy Arcturus shining brightly . The bright red glow leads him down<br/>
the path. He heads west along the towpath. At about 400 yards the moon is<br/>
shining silver on the bare silver wood of a dead tree on the north side<br/>
of the trail. He walks on 290 yards more, passing another dead tree<br/>
surrounded by sumac. Its branches overhang the path. Sixty steps beyond<br/>
out in the canal is marker number 791. After another 350 yards from the<br/>
2nd dead tree and past a third large dead tree an owl hoots and flies<br/>
past. Tom is a seasoned woodsman and is not startled easily. He has seen<br/>
the owl well before approaching the tree. <br/>
A terrific winter storm has blown down a large cottonwood . The 25' of<br/>
stump left is covered by shelf fungi. Starlight seems to gleam from the<br/>
end of a fallen portion of the cottonwood. Tom takes about 20 steps down<br/>
the bank to see what shines so. It is the reflection of the stars on the<br/>
fallen portion of the cottonwood. He muses on what celestial creatures<br/>
may traverse the limitless reaches of heaven. On a whim he decides to<br/>
leave a calling card hidden in the trunk. He pulls a small blue box from<br/>
his jacket, placing his card in the box, wondering if it will ever be<br/>
found and who might have a reason to wander off the towpath in this<br/>
wilderness. It is very quiet on the walk to the boat. It is a silent<br/>
night. <br/>
<br/>
Watch for poison ivy (3 to 5 leafs, hairy rope, there's lots of it along<br/>
the towpath), bees, spiders or other insects, snakes and small animals in<br/>
this area. Watch small children near the canal. There is no fee to enter<br/>
this park. Be prepared for the weather conditions, and take note of your<br/>
starting point. The walk described is only a very small portion of the<br/>
canal towpath park. Bicycles are permitted.<br/>

you and dispose of it properly. Do not harm wildlife or any living thing,<br/>

woods and fields better than you find them. Remember this is for fun! God<br/>
