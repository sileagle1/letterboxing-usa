Silent Night, &amp; Teddybear Picnic were fine but Ladybug98s Melted was broken<br/>
in 3 but we mounted it and it is as good as new and back in place.<br/>
<br/>
We hid 4 boxes and found Otter See This Box in Windham. Great spot, great<br/>
fun.  We had planned on getting Paddle to the Sea too but 1) my foot was<br/>
hurting by then 2) The park was packed yesterday and we just didn't know how<br/>
we could get it without drawing attention to the box.<br/>
<br/>
It was great to be in the fresh air! Hope ti see all of you on the trail.<br/>
I Tinker<br/>
