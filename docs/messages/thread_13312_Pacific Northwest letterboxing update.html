                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey there,<br/>
Princess Lea and I just got back from Vancouver, Canada where we were <br/>
able to find some great letterboxes! The Aldergrove Lake Regional <br/>
Park series of 3 were alive and well. Cute little microboxes. We also <br/>
got the Gardener's Box in Abbotsford, BC, but the Mill Lake box <br/>
eluded us--could be missing. And at Derby Reach, we got the <br/>
Explorers, Fort to Fort and the Gillnetter, before we had to leave <br/>
(as it was getting dark)--We searched in vain for the Wood Box and <br/>
believe it to be missing. <br/>
<br/>
On the drive, we picked up the Padden Puppy Trove which is a <br/>
letterbox/geocache hybrid (very well executed with an <br/>
entire "letterbox" within the geocache so folks cannot mistake it for <br/>
just another toy to exchange)<br/>
<br/>
The Starfish and the Clam at Larrabee State park were alive and well <br/>
and we picked up the Tacobet Mystery box too!<br/>
