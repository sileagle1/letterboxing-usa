<p>Take Route 44 East from Ashford, Phoenixville, or Abington until 
it joins with Route 169 North. You immediately see a gravel area to pull into to 
park your car on the right. This is part of the old rail line. Be careful 
crossing the street and go to your first left which is Railroad Street. You will 
see on your left the remains of the Pomfret Railroad station which still stood 
into the late 1990s, when it was destroyed by fire and leveled. Go to a clump of 
trees in a circle with many initials and hearts engraved into them. Take a 
bearing of 190 degrees and go to the fork of two paths. Take the one on the 
left. This is the old rail line. As you walk, you will pass what appears to be a 
storage area or lumber yard on your right. Walk along until you pass a trail 
going off to your left. Keep going and see that both sides of the rail line go 
down hill. This area is very short. Look on the south side of the rail bed for a 
lone white birch tree. Just past this point on the rail bed is another path that 
enters your trail at an angle. Go to that birch tree and take a bearing of 
directly north which points to a clump of trees. You go over a small depression 
and uphill about eight feet to the trees. Behind the trees the box is hidden 
under leaves and sticks. On top of that is a rectangular piece of iron about the 
size of half of a brick. This was found on the slope and must have something to 
do with the railroad. Under this you will find what you seek. From the car to 
the box should take about 15 to 20 minutes of 
walking.</p></div></body></html>
