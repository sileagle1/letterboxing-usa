<br/>
(((Kat))), and several others who asked. Here is how our first day <br/>
of letterbox hunting went:<br/>
Our grandson, Zachary, and I started off this morning around 10:15. <br/>
On the way to the Fred Jones Nature Sanctuary, near Portland, to <br/>
search for Funpig's P-3 letterbox, we discussed cotton farming. <br/>
There were cotton crops all along the way in all states of harvest. <br/>
Some were bare stalks, from already being picked, some had been <br/>
sprayed with defoliant and were turning brown, while others had <br/>
already lost their leaves and were awaiting the picker. Others were <br/>
still unsprayed and still others were being covered by the crop <br/>
duster as we watched. There was quite a bit of picked cotton on the <br/>
roadside that had been lost from the trucks. Zach wanted to stop and <br/>
get some, so we did. He got a piece for himself and a piece for me, <br/>
so we could add them to our logbooks, since ours have a scrapbooking <br/>
slant as well. <br/>
Once we got to Portland, we had some little bit of mix up finding <br/>
the right road, but found it shortly. Then we drove out of town and <br/>
taking a wrong turn, pulled alongside two historical markers. One <br/>
was about early farming in the area, but the other was about the <br/>
hurricane of 1919. It had been a summertime weekend and the storm <br/>
had been out in the Gulf building strength for two weeks. The <br/>
lodging along Corpus Christi Bayfront, just across the way, was <br/>
filled with vacationers. They were warned that the storm might be <br/>
bad, but many were unwilling to cut their last summer weekend short. <br/>
On Sunday, September 14 the storm made landfall there and demolished <br/>
all structures. The marker said that "It is estimated that as many <br/>
as 1000 were killed, although only around 284 bodies were ever found <br/>
or noted on official accounts of the time. Many of the bodies were <br/>
never identified as whole families perished and so there was no one <br/>
to identify them. Nearby oil tanks were breached and the bodies were <br/>
also covered in oil, hampering identification.<br/>
 Many of the bodies washed up near the area of Portland, and so they <br/>
were brought to the schoolhouse located at the site of the <br/>
historical marker. There they were first buried in what is now a <br/>
cotton field. Later the bodies were moved to Rose Hill Cemetery in <br/>
Corpus Christi. <br/>
 I found two interesting webpages about the 1919 hurricane if anyone <br/>
wants to learn more. <br/>

<br/>
After that we turned around to go to the Nature Sanctuary. It was <br/>
noon and very hot, but the trail was very thick with trees, bushes <br/>
and many other plants and vines that grew overhead as well as all <br/>
around us, so the sun did not beam down on us all that much. We <br/>
hiked several trails and saw anagua trees, bamboo thickets, Turk's <br/>
cap, Spanish olive trees, cat tails, yellow daisies, and many more <br/>
interesting plants. I noticed that the Turk's cap bushes were all as <br/>
eaten up by White Skipper butterfly larva, as mine are at home. <br/>
There were some tall flowers that had dried and gone to seed <br/>
sticking out from the path in many places. I wish I could have seen <br/>
them when they were growing in the spring, because I would really <br/>
like to know what they are. Even dead and gone to seed, they have a <br/>
nice form.  Many of the trees had identification markers beside <br/>
them. As for animals, we heard so many birds calls, and saw two <br/>
varieties of butterfly and lots of coyote spoor. There were benches <br/>
along the way also. When we came to a bridge, following our second <br/>
trail, the first having ended in a dead end, we were both so <br/>
excited!  We crossed as per the clues and found our first letterbox <br/>
 P-3, a `Nimble Pig collaboration'. <br/>
  We sat on a bench to examine the contents. There was a nice <br/>
logbook with a rough homemade paper look cover, and a wonderful <br/>
stamp inside. I was amazed at the skill and `cleanness' of Funhog's <br/>
stamp carving! You might remember that so far, the only hand carved <br/>
stamps I had seen were my own! ;) His was truly a beautiful stamp. <br/>
 Zach and I both stamped ourselves in to the P-3 book, then stamped <br/>
the box's stamp into our log books. I also took Zach's photo with <br/>
the box.<br/>
 After a little more hiking and looking at the great variety of <br/>
plant life, we headed back to the van and went back into town for <br/>
some lunch. THANKS Funhog, for a great first letterbox! :) <br/>
  We started back towards home, stopping at another location where I <br/>
hoped to plant the `normal' sized letterbox I prepared. That hike <br/>
was much hotter, as it was partially on a cement paved hiking trail, <br/>
and the plant life was mowed in wide swaths back from the sides of <br/>
the path. Eventually, we ran out of sidewalk, and continued on for <br/>
45 minutes in the blazing sun halfway around a lake. There were <br/>
several piers into the water, but still, we found no place suitable <br/>
for the letterbox. <br/>
  We came upon a large flock of snowy egrets, resting along the <br/>
water and in the trees, which flew up and around after we startled <br/>
them, eventually settling back down where they had been.  As for <br/>
other animals, we saw a cardinal and a frog and again lots of coyote <br/>
spoor. <br/>
 The heat and sun got to us, and when we got back to the car with <br/>
the prepared letterbox still with us, we again started down the <br/>
highway for home, not stopping in the park to look for hiding places <br/>
for the micro-boxes that I had also hoped to hide there today. <br/>
  After getting some distance away, I pulled off the road to a rest <br/>
stop to a place I had also thought about checking for a hiding spot <br/>
for one of my letterboxes. There was another historical marker in <br/>
that area, and we were fascinated by what it said. I had better luck <br/>
in that area as far as finding hiding places for my micro-boxes, and <br/>
so planted my first too. Zachary took my picture by the historical <br/>
marker, and then we sped home, tired but happy. <br/>
  Tomorrow my son and I are probably going to a different area to <br/>
hopefully plant the rest of my letterboxes. As soon as I get them <br/>
all planted, I will post clues. <br/>
<br/>
 So how did your day go, Kat? <br/>
