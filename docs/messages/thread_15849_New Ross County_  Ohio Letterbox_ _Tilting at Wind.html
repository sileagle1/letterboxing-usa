Chillicothe, Ross County, Ohio. Difficulty: Easy.   If my memory <br/>
serves me correctly, I believe the phrase "tilting at windmills" <br/>
refers to a pointless pursuit. But I am hopeful that you will find <br/>
that this quest is not at all pointless and that you will be pleased <br/>
will the results.  CLUES: Go to the upper parking lot near the <br/>
gymnasium at Ohio University- Chillicothe. A stairway leads from <br/>
here to the street below and to a lower level entrance to the <br/>
building. Go down the stairs. At the bottom of the stairway, turn <br/>
left and walk 14 paces. Stop. You should be standing at the end of <br/>
the sidewalk, with the westernmost edge of a brick wall immediately <br/>
to your left. The letterbox is hidden under the rocks at the base of <br/>
the opposite side of the wall, about one foot in from the edge.<br/>
