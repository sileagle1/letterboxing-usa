                    <div class="plaintext-content">Stonestashing was an idea that came out of a conversations on alternatives<br/>
to geocaching. Someone had the idea of creating rock cairns that folks would<br/>
come and place a rock on the pile as they visited it.<br/>
<br/>
I personally object for many reasons, including the fact that the intent is<br/>
never to remove this pile from the spot. With geocaching the idea is<br/>
nonpermanence and low impact, as is letterboxing. A rock cairn in the forest<br/>
could really get out of hand.<br/>

 There really isn't anything to object to... The<br/>
theory is to hide these in much the same way as<br/>
current letterboxes/geocaches. Not to create "massive<br/>
cairns" small carved rocks, in the same way of carved<br/>
stamps are hidden in areas and clues are given to the<br/>
location of these "stamps"... There is no need or<br/>
desire for a logbook at the site... just the rock,<br/>
which can easily blend in with it's surrondings... The<br/>
"cairn" problem develops when people start leaving new<br/>
stones, if they want to... Dr. Mings can correct me if<br/>
I have this to far afield.<br/>

Actually there had been some discussion of the possibility of <br/>
visitors leaving personal stones at sites. However, I think the <br/>
consensus among the few of us discussing it  was that may not be such <br/>
a good idea. The idea of stonestashing as I envision it is detailed <br/>
on the site. The site needs a lot of additional development that I <br/>
haven't had a chance to do this past month. I will be getting back to <br/>
it very soon. I am curious what other objections you might have had? <br/>
I have placed stonestashes in Florida and West Virginia though not <br/>
all the clues are up there yet. I have also placed a blank stone <br/>
someone can use for carving in a geocache (as my contribution to the <br/>
catch) somewhere in West Virginia ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else besides Scott is having trouble accessing the site <br/>
please let me know. The bulletin board needs a bug fixed so rather <br/>
than sign up on the site please contact me directly (not on this <br/>
list) if you want to participate in the discussion boards. I hope to <br/>
have that fixed in the next week or so.<br/>

Hi Chip<br/>
<br/>
Now that was a good film (imho)<br/>
<br/>
....and it was certainly honest to goodness Letterboxing in that long walk<br/>
along the stone wall to the box under the tree !  ( very Dartmoor like !)<br/>
<br/>
It's a great letterboxing advert !<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing by bus is very tough though !<br/>
<br/>
Sure it had a nice stone on top ...But...No stones in the box eh ! (So its<br/>
not stone stashing) <br/>
<br/>
..but it did have another clue in the box...even more letterboxing like.<br/>
<br/>
I think you should plant that box in a field in Maine ..sounds cool!<br/>
<br/>
It's a film that deserves a letterbox tribute <grin><br/>
<br/>
Best wishes <br/>
<br/>

I do have a field in Maine picked out, but every time<br/>
I go near it it breaks my heart, it was the site of my<br/>
families farm, 1000 acres in Sabattus, rolling green<br/>
hills dedicated to potatoes and a little corn (for the<br/>
cows) the barn is in shambles and the fields are<br/>
overgrown. I suppose I may need another field!<br/>
<br/>
Note to those planning their estates: when passing<br/>
land don't give it to the lazy son who cant get off<br/>
his bum, give it to the son or daughter who worked the<br/>
land for many years and can enjoy it!<br/>
<br/>
Just a note, and with each passing minute I can feel<br/>
me wanting to go north.<br/>
