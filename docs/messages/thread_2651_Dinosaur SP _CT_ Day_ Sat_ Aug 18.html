                    <div class="plaintext-content">We visited Dinosaur SP in Rocky Hill, CT this weekend, found the GREAT boxes <br/>
and even made a cast of one of the dino prints!  I think we were the only <br/>
ones there without kids!  The Exhibit Center is pretty fascinating, too.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we picked up a Dinosaur SP Day flyer while we there, and I thought <br/>
I'd share the details:  Saturday, August 18, 10am-3:30pm, rain or shine.  <br/>
Music, kids activities, magicians, refreshments, grab bags, treasure hunt <br/>
(we know ALL ABOUT treasure hunts :), balloons, face-painting.  Outdoor <br/>
activities are free, the Exhibit Hall has a small admission fee.  (It was $2 <br/>
for adults.)  It sounds like a great time for the kids!<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
