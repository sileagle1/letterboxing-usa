<br/>
We attempted to find the Lost Loon boxes yesterday (22 Jul) with no <br/>
luck after LOTS of searching!!!  We left no stone unturned.  Did <br/>
notice a lot of damage to the trail at different areas and MANY, <br/>
MANY passersby.  Is it possible that they were removed?  Also, <br/>
noticed that there is a 'trail group' that cleans up the trail <br/>
weekly so wonder if they came across it?  We, too, found the 1st <br/>
Thanksgiving quite readily.  Also, found the Tacoma Nature Center's <br/>
yesterday, too--without a hitch!<br/>
