Name of the Letterbox: Letterbox on the Ridge<br/>
<br/>
Date placed: November 3rd, 2001<br/>
<br/>
State/County: Ohio/Cuyahoga County<br/>
<br/>
Nearest Town: Cleveland<br/>
<br/>
Directions to the area of the Letterbox: Take I-480 to the Great Northern Blvd.(RT. 252) exit (depending when you look for it, it might be changed to Columbia Road). At the end of the exit, turn north. Take a right onto Brookpark Road (east). Take a left onto Mastick Road. Follow Mastick Road down into the Rocky River Reservation of the Cleveland Metroparks. Cross the Valley Parkway and find Mastick Woods Golf Course on your left hand side. Park in the parking lot near the golf course.<br/>
<br/>
Clues to find Letterbox: Along the left side of the golf course, left when facing East (same as facing the golf course), and alongside the Rocky River, is a bridle trail.  Follow this trail beyond and away from the golf course.  You'll go by an area with a bunch of cut logs.  Further along the trail you will find a small pile of stones and pebbles on the right.  Continue following the trail until you reach the next semi-steep hill.  After that, look for the longest set of guard rails you have seen so far while walking on the trail (its pretty obvious), they should keep you from falling off either side of the trail and into a little run-off creek, which may or may not be dry.  It might be possible to see some a tire or two in this creek.  Don't worry if you can't see any tires, because the big clue is the longest guard rails on both sides of the trail after the hill.  If you end up by where the trail splits into 2 you've gone to far.  Walk up to the guard rails, and turn to your right.  You should see the point where a narrow ridge starts to climb.  Do you like how high it goes?  Well, good, because now you get to climb it.  As you ascend the ridge, stay on the narrow "path".  Its more like an old deer trail.  One of your early obstacles will be to climb up the roots of a tree to be able to continue on the path.  Proceed up the ridge with caution, and notice a group of tree roots that more or less resemble a hand on the right.  We noticed when we placed this Letterbox that there were many beer cans spread down the right part of the ridge near the "hand".  Continue past this strange site and begin to look under the raised roots of trees on the left side of, but still on, the ridge.  These roots are above the ground you're walking on. One set of them is the home to our Letterbox. Look for a plastic box with a purple lid that is approximately 8 by 14 inches.  Please stamp the book on a blank page and take something from the Letterbox, while putting something of your own in it.  Also, BYOSP (bring your own stamp pad).  Please remember to leave a message with your stamp and copy down the email addresses in the front of the notebook and email us so we can learn more about your adventure.  Make sure you get a look at the surroundings.  Its an awesome sight.  Hope you have fun looking for (and hopefully finding) our little Letterbox.  Thanks!!! ~ David &amp; Ben ~<br/>
