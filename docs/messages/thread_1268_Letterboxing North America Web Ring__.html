<br/>
The Letterboxing North America Web Ring is up and running, and is a <br/>
replacement for the previous Web Ring, which Marty maintained. I have <br/>
had only about 20-percent of the sites from the previous Ring contact <br/>
me -- we can't lose this resource! Without it, finding the various <br/>
Web sites devoted to Letterboxing would be nigh impossible!<br/>
<br/>
Without the old Web Ring, people will not have a clue that sites such <br/>
as Kids' Corner and the wonderful Letterbook in Vermont are out there!<br/>
<br/>
If you have a site to add to the new REPLACEMENT Web Ring (yes, the <br/>
old one is GOING AWAY!), the URL is <br/>
<br/>
http://nav.webring.yahoo.com/hub?ring=letterboxingnort&amp;id=1&amp;hub<br/>
<br/>
Go there and click on "Join This Ring." It's easy!!!<br/>
<br/>
Please, if there is anything I can do to help maintain any sites, let <br/>
me know. I build Web sites for a living, so I have a pretty good idea <br/>
of what to do, and I am ready and willing to step up to the plate!<br/>
<br/>
I just got interested in this wonderful pastime and want to spread <br/>
the word.<br/>
