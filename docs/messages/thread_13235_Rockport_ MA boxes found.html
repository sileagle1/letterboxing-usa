Star  boxes today. They were both found with little difficulty, which <br/>
was nice :) We also found the Little Wings HH and plan to listen to <br/>
the CD before setting it on its way.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes were both in good condition even after allll the rain we've <br/>
had here the last 2 weeks and we tried to hide them well<br/>
