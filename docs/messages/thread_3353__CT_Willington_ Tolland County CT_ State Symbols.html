Town of Willington in 1994 to be maintained as the Fenton-Ruby Park and<br/>
Wildlife Preserve.  Managed by the Willington Conservation Commission,<br/>
it contains about 225 acres of forests, grassy fields, marshes, and<br/>
ponds. Wilbert Ruby bought the land in 1908 he was also the owner and<br/>
operator of the Ruby Lumber Company, an important part of the town's<br/>
economy at the time. This was left to his son Clarke who was born in the<br/>
house, which has sense burned down. You can see a bit of the foundation<br/>
across from the Parking lot.<br/>

&gt; "The State Flower" Letterbox #1<br/>
&gt; From the parking lot take a right onto Burma Road you will see the<br/>
&gt; trailhead on the right for Ridge trail. This is the White trail it <br/>
is<br/>
&gt; .93 miles and has steep places along the way.  Follow the trail up <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; hill and on your right there is a large rotted tree that was cut <br/>
down<br/>
&gt; and landed precariously on to its stump. The trail bends to the <br/>
left and<br/>
&gt; to the right continuing up the hill thru the dense mountain laurel<br/>
&gt; gradually turning back and forth over dead trees. You will twist and<br/>
&gt; turn going up and down working your way to the top of the hill.  As <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; rise to your right you will see some ledge out of the hill and to <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; left is an oasis of Mountain Laurel. It gets steeper here. When you <br/>
are<br/>
&gt; about to reach the top on your left there is a tree with a large <br/>
waste<br/>
&gt; line. As you continue, you will come to a steep knoll and to your <br/>
right<br/>
&gt; there is a drop off down into the valley.  You will go down off that<br/>
&gt; knoll.  Keep going until you start walking thru ledge out cropping <br/>
on<br/>
&gt; top of the ridge. On your right you look over the valley.  On your <br/>
left<br/>
&gt; look for the under side of a fallen tree, with stones in and around <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; roots, go around the left side to find what you seek. Continue down <br/>
off<br/>
&gt; the ridge, there will be a large out cropping of ledge on your left.<br/>
&gt; Follow around it and you will now get a glimpse of Taylor Pond on <br/>
your<br/>
&gt; right. You are really going down off the mountain now twisting and<br/>
&gt; turning until you reach the road. You can go right to Letterbox #2 <br/>
or go<br/>
&gt; left back to your car.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "The State Tree" Letterbox #2<br/>
&gt; From the parking lot take a right onto Burma Road, you will see on <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; left the trail head for Taylor pond which is the Yellow trail it <br/>
is .73<br/>
&gt; miles long. Take this trail and as you go you will come to a very <br/>
nice<br/>
&gt; wooden bridge made by the boy scouts. From the bridge you can see <br/>
Taylor<br/>
&gt; pond, continue following the ponds edge.  When you come out of the <br/>
white<br/>
&gt; pine grove there will be a bench with a view of the pond, what a <br/>
great<br/>
&gt; place for a drink and a snack. Continue on and look for a white <br/>
pine on<br/>
&gt; your right that looks like it was hit by lighting. You'll come to an<br/>
&gt; open field with a glimpse of the pond on your right the trail will <br/>
turn<br/>
&gt; left and enter the woods again. Here you will see a three sister <br/>
pine<br/>
&gt; where the trail bares right stay on the yellow trail and follow the<br/>
&gt; stonewall. The trail leaves the stonewall and you enter a grove of <br/>
Iron<br/>
&gt; wood trees. Start looking for a very old White Oak on you're left <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; behind this is what you seek. Now continue through the grove you <br/>
will<br/>
&gt; come out to a small field moving toward the pond for another look.<br/>
&gt; Follow the trail away from the pond and back into the woods where <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; will walk between two white pines and along a stonewall, that is on <br/>
your<br/>
&gt; left. Watch your head for the low overpass. You'll now cross over <br/>
two<br/>
&gt; sets of plank bridges. Then cross over a stonewall and keep going <br/>
until<br/>
&gt; you reach an intersection with a sign that says "Connector to Ruby<br/>
&gt; trail" take a right and continue on. You will cross a dry stream <br/>
and a<br/>
&gt; pair of wood bridges. The trail turns right and then you will go up <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; small hill and thru a stonewall opening. As you go you will see a <br/>
marker<br/>
&gt; that shows you an Ironwood tree (carpinus caroliniana) and then <br/>
after<br/>
&gt; that there is a marker for a Black Cherry tree (Prunus serotina) <br/>
also on<br/>
&gt; the right. Continue on over another stonewall and wood bridge and <br/>
back<br/>
&gt; to the dirt road. Take a right to return to your car or go left to <br/>
do<br/>
&gt; the next letterbox.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  "The State Animal" Letterbox #3<br/>
&gt;  Take a right out of the Parking lot on to the dirt road. Go past <br/>
white<br/>
&gt; and yellow trails in and out's. Stay on the dirt road looking for <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Ruby trail which is the red trail on your left it's a little over a <br/>
1<br/>
&gt; mile long and has steep places. Enter at the very large Maple go <br/>
until<br/>
&gt; you come to an intersection take a right here. You will walk <br/>
between 2<br/>
&gt; glacial erratics and work your way up the hill. Then you will <br/>
descend<br/>
&gt; down and pass more glacial rocks. You will enter a grove of Ironwood<br/>
&gt; trees.  Keep going you will be gradually climbing the hill. When you<br/>
&gt; reach the very top look for a medium size 2 sister pine on your left<br/>
&gt; it's very, very close to the trail. Off in the distance there is a <br/>
very<br/>
&gt; large 3 sister pine on your right. Start looking on your right for a<br/>
&gt; large rock which looks to me like the mouth of a whale here is box <br/>
# 3.<br/>
&gt; Continue on, you will now go down thru some Mountain Laurel. (This <br/>
area<br/>
&gt; is very icy in the early spring).  The trail bends left, and then <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; will cross over the stonewall.  On your left is a very large rock. <br/>
You<br/>
&gt; will now be walking along side a stonewall. Start looking for a <br/>
rock on<br/>
&gt; your left and here is box # 4 "The State Bird" it's behind it. You <br/>
will<br/>
&gt; wish you brought your camera for this one. Black and White would be<br/>
&gt; best. Continue on down a hill and be careful you are going to need <br/>
sure<br/>
&gt; footing. There will be a wood bridge to cross then go up and turn <br/>
to the<br/>
&gt; right. Follow along side the stonewall until it disappears. On your<br/>
&gt; right there will be a grouping of glacial rocks, the trail turns <br/>
left<br/>
&gt; away from them. You will come to a wood bridge with a <br/>
sign "Connector to<br/>
&gt; Taylor Pond" this is a blue trail. Don't go over if you need to get<br/>
&gt; back. (If you're ready for Box # 5 go over the bridge and follow <br/>
the Box<br/>
&gt; # 5 direction from this point.)   Ok, to get back you will go by a <br/>
tree<br/>
&gt; marker on your left for a White Oak (quercus alaba). On your right<br/>
&gt; another tree marker for Red Oak (quercus rubra) and then on your <br/>
right<br/>
&gt; again another tree marker for White Ash. The trail bends to the <br/>
right<br/>
&gt; and you will come to the end of a stonewall turn left after you <br/>
pass it<br/>
&gt; and now you are walking between two stonewalls. As you follow these<br/>
&gt; walls you come to the intersection where you started. Take a right <br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the dirt road back to your car.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "The State Insect" Letterbox # 5<br/>
&gt; Take a right out of the Parking lot on to the dirt road. Go past <br/>
white<br/>
&gt; and yellow trails in and out's. Stay on the dirt road looking for <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Ruby trail, which is the red trail on your left. Enter at the very <br/>
large<br/>
&gt; Maple go straight thru the intersection (don't take the right) you <br/>
will<br/>
&gt; be walking between two stonewalls, the wall to the right will end <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; the trail will turn to the right. Continue on, the trail will bend <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the left and you will see a tree marker for White ash on your left. <br/>
The<br/>
&gt; next tree with a marker will also be on your left it's a Red Oak. <br/>
There<br/>
&gt; will be one more marker for a White Oak it's on your right. A little<br/>
&gt; further there will be a bridge on your left with a sign "Connector <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; Taylor Pond trail" it's a blue trail. (If you continued on from box <br/>
# 4<br/>
&gt; here is where you pick up the directions) Go over the bridge go up <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; embankment turn right it's like walking on a dike. You will go up<br/>
&gt; another embankment where it levels off and you will see a tree <br/>
marker on<br/>
&gt; your left for a Black Oak tree (quercus velotina). You are at the<br/>
&gt; beginning of  a large stonewall.  On your right will be a tree <br/>
marker<br/>
&gt; for a White Pine (pinus strobus). On your right you will be looking <br/>
for<br/>
&gt; a tree with 5 fingers reaching up to the sky. This is where Box # 5 <br/>
is.<br/>
&gt; The trail goes down and then bends to the right continue on until <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; come to an intersection and take the left. You will cross a dry <br/>
stream<br/>
&gt; and a pair of wood bridges. The trail turns right and then you will <br/>
go<br/>
&gt; up a small hill and thru an opening in a stonewall. As you go you <br/>
will<br/>
&gt; see a marker that shows you an Ironwood tree (carpinus caroliniana) <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; then after that there is another marker for a Black Cherry tree <br/>
(Prunus<br/>
&gt; serotina) also on the right. Continue on over the stonewall and wood<br/>
&gt; bridge and back to the dirt road. Take a right to return to your <br/>
car.<br/>
