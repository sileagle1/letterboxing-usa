experience to yours when she was 2. She walked out onto a Beaver dam and then 
walked off the edge into the water. Well the water was only a few inches deep 
and about 5 feet of mud. Of coarse her dad had to get out on the dam and pull 
her up by her collar. Her advice to you is to always have someone with you 
and wear a dam collar or necklace so someone can pull you out by your neck. It 
worked very well with her. .....Chuck and Molly

                    <html><body><p>Glad you are ok from your ordeal. I can understand how you couldn't get out. It's nasty stuff and after trying to get out for awhile then you get tired out. At least you didn't panic. That would have made it much worse. Glad to see another "dog person" in letterboxing. I've saved a few dogs over the years. I feel their life is valuable just as a persons. About the dog rolling in stinky stuff, if yours is like Molly, it's shoulder first then a good roll. Spreads around nice. They love it. If you get a chance, take a look at my website under dog-isms. Lots of good quotes about dogs. It's <a href="http://www.chuckstraub.com">www.chuckstraub.com</a> Good luck and stay away from that mud.....Chuck and Molly
