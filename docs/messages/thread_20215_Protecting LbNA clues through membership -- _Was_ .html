Subject: [LbNA] Protecting LbNA clues through membership -- (Was:<br/>
How?????)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The answer is easier than that, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
With no disrespect to database sites like WoL or AtlasQuest, if we <br/>
accept that the LbNA database is as close to the "official" source <br/>
of letterboxing clues that we have, then it could be password <br/>
protected.<br/>
<br/>
In order to get clues, you'll have to register as a letterboxer and <br/>
receive a username and password.  The owners of the site -- and <br/>
indeed the community at large -- would have to discuss the best way <br/>
to administer this and how to ensure that those who have access are <br/>
true letterboxers, etc. (so that this person couldn't simply <br/>
register himself).  Perhaps an annual membership fee (something <br/>
reasonable like $25 or $30) could be instituted to help with the <br/>
cost of the administration.<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone care to discuss this idea farther?<br/>

&gt; We really enjoy this and are scared that it will lead to a WOM <br/>
&gt; activity. This is my question. How will we get clues if we are not <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; a loop with others? How about a snail mail newsletter or a monthly <br/>
&gt; subscription site? This might keep the jackals away.<br/>
