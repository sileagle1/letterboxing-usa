Gentle Readers,<br/>
<br/>
In the words of Rodney King, "Why can't we all just get along?"<br/>
<br/>
This summer, while hot on the trail of our first find, my little "herd" and I <br/>
came across another group of 'boxers on the trail (you know who you are!).  <br/>
While we were exchanging stamps, an experienced boxer in the other group asked <br/>
me if I was subscribed to the LbNA list.  When I told her I had just signed up <br/>
that morning, she said cryptically, "That's the angriest group of people I <br/>
have ever come across." I thought (silly me!), "What an odd thing to say!  What <br/>
could people pursuing so a genteel hobby POSSIBLY find to fight about?" <br/>
<br/>
Well, after having spent the past 4 or 5 months watching villagers run to and <br/>
fro with pitchforks and blazing torches, I know what she meant. I have kept <br/>
silent while 'boxers who have added a great deal to US letterboxing were being <br/>
burned at the stake or driven from the list. However, I have come to find the <br/>
ever-present smell of smoke in the air tiresome--and waving pitchforks have <br/>
often have unfortunate consequences.<br/>
<br/>
My Christmas (or Hanukkah or Kwanzaa or winter solstice or whatever!) wishes <br/>
for all of the folks on the list:<br/>
<br/>
~May you not take offense where no offense is intended.<br/>
~May you not give offense deliberately.<br/>
~May you not fan the flames when a spark is struck or when embers are <br/>
a-dying.<br/>
~May you not continually seek to have the last word--especially in so public <br/>
a forum.<br/>
~May you channel your pique at other 'boxers into carving lovely stamps or <br/>
burn off your irritation in long hikes planting new boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and best wishes to all.  'Nuff said.<br/>
<br/>
~Doughnut<br/>
