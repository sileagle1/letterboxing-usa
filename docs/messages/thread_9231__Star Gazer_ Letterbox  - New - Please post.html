The "Star Gazer" Letterbox can be found at Brazos Bend State Park, <br/>
where Texas colonization was begun by Stephen F. Austin.  The park <br/>
preserves habitat for many species of birds, and contains many <br/>
American Alligators.  Also in the park is the George Observatory, <br/>
which is open to the public from 3pm to 10pm on Saturdays.  Call 979-<br/>
553-3400 for more information.   The "Star Gazer" letterbox is near <br/>
the observatory, but can be found on any day.<br/>
