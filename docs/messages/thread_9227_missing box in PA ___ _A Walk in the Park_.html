<div>We checked on our letter boxes ("A Walk in the 
Park") yesterday only to find that the 1st of our 2 boxes at Zuck Park in 
Erie, PA was missing. I don't know what happened ... we had them very securely 
(or so we thought) hidden and didn't expect any problems with critters or 
passerby's disturbing them. We decided to pull the second box until we can make 
a new set of stamps. It would be difficult to recarve the 
missing half. It may be a while before that happens ... if we can 
remake our stamps before the snow gets too deep we will try to rehide it before 
Christmas. If the weather doesn't cooperate we will probably wait until spring.

<div>Letterboxing hasn't caught on well in our area yet ... I'm 
hoping to change that next summer. It is taking me time to get permission for 
some of the sites we would like to hide some new boxes, so keep watch for them 
in the future. </div>
