<br/>
<br/>
Lately, there has been talk of letterboxing in the nude. This idea creeps me<br/>
out. <br/>
The ink pads don't last that long anyway, I mean the tacky thumb prints are<br/>
bad enough but, that is the only body part I would want to see stamped into<br/>
my logbook.<br/>
<br/>
So, I respectfully request that anyone seeking The Covered Bridge series in<br/>
NH to do so with clothes on. At least until you rehide the box, then I don't<br/>
care if you run through the briar patch with no loin cloth on.  :)<br/>

Oh, and some of my grotto members now box with me. Hmmmmm.....could make for a very intersting event stamp.<br/>

<br/>
I've never found a box in the nude, but I did plant one while in the <br/>
buff at the Arizona Hot Springs.<br/>
<br/>
But there's a lot of nude people running around that place, so I <br/>
didn't feel too out of the ordinary.  =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Lately, there has been talk of letterboxing in the nude. This <br/>
idea <br/>

&gt; &gt; The ink pads don't last that long anyway, I mean the tacky <br/>

&gt; would want to see stamped into my logbook.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, I respectfully request that anyone seeking The Covered <br/>

patch <br/>
&gt; with no loin cloth on.  :)<br/>
