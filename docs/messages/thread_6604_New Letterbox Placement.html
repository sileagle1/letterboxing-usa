<div>The name of this letterbox is "Get in to the 
Game".  It was placed on 1 August 2002 by my son, Elvis and me.  My 
name is John Miller.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Instructions:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This box is placed just outside the I495 Beltway in 
Fairfax County Virginia.  It is located in the Accotink Stream Valley Park 
which is one of many parks which lie along the Cross County Trail.  
Accotink Stream Valley Park is located between Routes 50 and 236 (Little River 
Turnpike), and Woodburn Road and the I495 Beltway.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To reach the letterbox, park at the Eakin Community 
Park.  The parking lot is located on the east side of Prosperity Ave. 
between Routes 50 and 236.  After parking, walk east along the Cross County 
Trail (CCT) about 3/4 miles until you reach Woodburn 
Road.  Cross Woodburn and continue east along the CCT about 1/2 
mile.  The trail will change from asphalt to gravel, and then back to 
concrete.  You're pretty close when the trail turns back 
to concrete.  Shortly after that, there will be a trail information 
sign on the right titled "What Is a Watershed?".  50 to 75 yards after the 
sign, there will be a low retaining wall on the left.  At the beginning of 
the retaining wall, a trail will go up and to the left on a 50 degree 
bearing.  Go approximately 30 feet up the trail.  Stop and turn 90 
degrees to the left (this should have you facing a 320 degree 
bearing).  About 25 feet away, you will see a large, very tall tree, 
approximately 2 feet in diameter.  Just a few feet to the right of the tree 
you will see four much smaller very close together.  Just in front of the 
large tree there are several large gray rocks.  "Get In To The 
Game" is place in a cavity to the right and below one of the larger 
rocks.  The cavity is concealed by a section of log about 2 feet long and 8 
inches in diameter.  I hope you enjoy this park.  My son and I have 
enjoyed many long walks and bike rides there.  Keep your eye out for the 
deer and owl which can often be seen there.  Also, there are several places 
where the work of beavers can be seen, however, we have never seen the 
beavers.      </div></div></body></html>
