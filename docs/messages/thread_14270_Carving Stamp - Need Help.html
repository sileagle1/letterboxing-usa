How do you clear the large areas around the stamp that need to be smooth? I have shaved this area away but it isn't very smooth and when I stamp it leaves marks on the paper. <br/>

<br/>
When I carve a stamp I first do the fine lines with a Speedball # 1 "V"<br/>
linoleum cutter. Then for clearing out large areas I go to my handy<br/>
dandy Speedball # 5 (Gouge) .<br/>
But you have to be very cautious and not wipe out your fingers ,or parts<br/>
of the stamp you would like to keep.<br/>
I always try to carve away from the image .<br/>
PZKut is the best material have found so far. It cuts like butter.And<br/>
you don't limit your stamp size.and the cutter can be used for months<br/>
without sharpening!<br/>
<br/>
After you have most of your stamp carved  I will take a light blue ink<br/>
pad and just touch it to the stamp to bring out the material that still<br/>
must be removed.<br/>
<br/>
If you are doing letters I would cut out the inside of the letter first<br/>
.It is more stable that way.(Cut out the inside of the "O" first,then<br/>
the outside.)<br/>
<br/>
The MOST IMPORTANT TIP <br/>
 is have a CD playing through your headphones ! RELAXX &amp; ENJOY !!  LOL<br/>

<br/>
To get rid of the extra space, continue to outline the image with the <br/>
#4 nib. Test ocassionally with the ink to see which spot need more <br/>
attention. To "finish" the outside areas you can use a number of <br/>
different methods. By examining a stamp for about an hour, I learned on <br/>
of Ryan's methods and it works great. So as to not ruin his carving <br/>
style, or my interpretation of it, I'd say Vertical cuts, outside <br/>
carve, horizontal cuts ridge tops.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
