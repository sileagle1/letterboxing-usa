I hope all is well for you and the others in S. Cal.  My sister is in <br/>
San Diego and is just a few miles from one fo the fires that has <br/>
finally been nearly contained.  The situation she describes to me <br/>
as she has called each day is just insane.  What a terrifying <br/>
thing.  Our thoughts are with you all.<br/>

&gt; you all.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, most of us letterboxers here in So. Cal. are OK except <br/>
for bouts with bad air (probably worse for Purple Iris, Buzzard and <br/>
Doughnut than for me as they are closer than I am).  The whole thing is <br/>
just mind-blowing to think about. The sheer number of acres burned and <br/>
homes lost (over 2800 so far) is staggering.<br/>
<br/>
Once the Santa Ana winds stopped blowing to the west, the on-shore flow <br/>
started blowing to the east and are fanning the fires just as much as the <br/>
Santa Anas despite bringing in more moisture.  The good news is that is <br/>
looks like rain is in the forecast for this weekend, anywhere between 40- <br/>
90% chance depending on where you are located.<br/>
<br/>
It almost seems insensitive to bring this up in light of the homes and <br/>
lives that have been lost in the fires so I apologize in advance to anyone <br/>
who may be offended: It appears that we may have lost a few letterboxes to <br/>
the fires.  I am pretty sure the one I planted near Julian is gone as it <br/>
was in the middle of the biggest fire in So. Cal. and it seems that many of <br/>
the boxes near Lake Arrowhead have been burned as well.<br/>
<br/>
We are all hoping for rain this weekend to help put an end to the fires.  <br/>
Thanks for your concern and thoughts for us!<br/>

We have also been watching with horror the fires burn where we once<br/>
lived and walked and could not believe it.  We hope and pray they are<br/>
put out soon and you all will have your lives returned to some sort of<br/>
normalicy.<br/>
