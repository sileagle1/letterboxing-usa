Forest Environmental Education Center to check out the Nolde Forest <br/>
Series.  What a great series!!  This series was placed in October of <br/>
2002 and we couldn't believe we were only the 5th group to stamp in <br/>
the first box of the series and the SECOND to stamp in at the other <br/>
two!! (Of course, Wanda and Pete had been there!)  Nolde Forest is <br/>
really a neat, beautiful place to visit - great history and great <br/>
trails, too.  (And we saw about 3 bugs in contrast to the MILLIONS <br/>
we encounter here in CT recently.)  The series involved a lot of <br/>
walking and a lot of thinking outside of the box, but it was great - <br/>
really leaves you with a sense of accomplishment!  Why haven't YOU <br/>
been there yet?<br/>
