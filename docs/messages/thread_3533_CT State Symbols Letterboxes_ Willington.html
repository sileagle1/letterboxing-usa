loved this set because there were surprises in each box!  Just right for <br/>
5-year-olds.  The clues were excellent, the stamps are really nicely carved <br/>
and using the directions you could easily break this set up into 3 hunts of <br/>
about a mile or less.  It sure was a beautiful day to be letterboxing!  <br/>
Thanks to the Willington Gang for a great series of boxes.<br/>

are 5 and 12 love the boxes. My 12 year old said what a great way to <br/>
learn a school lesson about our state symbols. Without being in <br/>
school.<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
