                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've read with interest some of the recent discussions regarding<br/>
setting up a database to track letterbox status, etc.<br/>
First, although I'm one of the 'old timers', for various reasons, I've<br/>
not been doing the 'heavy lifting'' that has kept the site and the<br/>
hobby growing, so kudos to the many that do, and I agree that they all<br/>
have enough to do just keeping up. If it ain't broke,,....etc. So this<br/>
is NOT intended to induce any 'boat-rocking'.<br/>
<br/>
So this post is for the database-folks who are looking for ways to<br/>
channel their enthusiasm for the hobby in helpful directions. Others<br/>
lacking this interest might choose to skip the rest of this<br/>
post.........<br/>
<br/>
The database discussion echoes a similar vein of about a year and a<br/>
half ago, both on-line and at a small gathering in southern VT.  At<br/>
that, translating clues into a database format seemed unnecessary<br/>
cumbersome for that time and scale of things, and likely to encumber<br/>
what was then a pretty smooth process of clue-posting by an ad-hoc<br/>
regional division of responsibility.  At that time, I didn't even have<br/>
a database program. But we pretty much agreed that any large explosion<br/>
of letterbox population might become a burden to those that have taken<br/>
on the work under the system then in place.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, I was envisioning linking a database with GIS software<br/>
(specifically, ESRI's "Arc-View"-which I have, and licensed for use<br/>
with my local planning commission, but with which am not particularly<br/>
facile). While there are other programs out there, ESRI's software is<br/>
the software of choice for most geographic-base planning as far as I<br/>
know. They have a web-site for those interested. http://www.esri.com/<br/>
<br/>
This software, if purchased for legal LBNA licensed use, is about<br/>
$1,000. What it would offer is easy conversion from database info into<br/>
a variety of geographic-based graphic formats, say for example, a red<br/>
dot on a world or US or state or county map(s) hyperlinked to the<br/>
database page(s) or clue page for each letterbox. It was pretty much<br/>
agreed then that as nice as this in theory, getting it up and running<br/>
would be onerous, fraught with unknowns, and expensive to get a legal<br/>
software license that could be shared among the LBNA Webmasters. With<br/>
which I agreed then, and probably still do now.<br/>
<br/>
However, and the point of this lengthy post, is to suggest  (1) that<br/>
any database work done for LBNA be translatable (now or in the future)<br/>
to the Arc-View platform, which translates now to using (or something<br/>
convertible into) Microsoft Access as a (Windows) database platform.<br/>
ArcView has its own internal database software, but can easily import<br/>
Access although it may accept others as well.  And, (2) it needs a<br/>
geographic locator in one (or more) fields, for each letterbox in<br/>
order to generate a map. It will read (within the US) all<br/>
municipalities, all counties, all US zip-code districts,<br/>
latitude/longitude points, plus lots of other map objects. It can read<br/>
and plot terrain models (topo at the scale appropriate to the map,<br/>
road networks, and all kinds of things that go beyond our likely<br/>
needs. It will accept (I believe) 'either/or' searches, so having the<br/>
same locator field for ALL clues is not necessary, as long as at least<br/>
one exists. It places a marker (or several evenly distributed) equally<br/>
within the locator field (say, a municipality), or, directly on the<br/>
letterbox site in the case of lat/longitude  or other more specific<br/>
info availability.<br/>
<br/>
I AM NOT at all suggested publishing letterbox clues to the degree of<br/>
specificity available with GPS hardware - save that for the<br/>
geo-caching folks. I am saying that (1) most clues now have something<br/>
to give a general-enough location for the database, and (2) several<br/>
locator options are available to give new clue-writers several options<br/>
that will work.<br/>
<br/>
My point to all this is to keep the long view in mind if someone<br/>
undertakes building a database, whether or not it becomes part of the<br/>
clue-submittal process now.  Please consider setting it up for future<br/>
GIS-compatibility early-on.<br/>
<br/>
At some point, clue-submittals could be sent in via a template form,<br/>
which in turn integrates automatically into the database. The<br/>
webmaster(s) running the software then repost the appropriate map(s),<br/>
which are automatically updated with new info. This might then easily<br/>
be scheduled at some more predictable interval (each month? Each two<br/>
weeks?). File size and where it will be hosted will always present a<br/>
problem, as I am sure it does now.<br/>
<br/>
This is all very utopian I know, and my apologies to my fellow<br/>
webmasters who toil quietly and are saying (gad - not Erik and this<br/>
old saw yet again). LBNA is a great thing, obviously bringing lots of<br/>
happiness to lots of families, which has always been the main point.<br/>
Long may you run!<br/>

As a new-timer, I've been reading these web enhancement and database<br/>
discussions with great interest.  Being a web nerd myself, I think it<br/>
would be useful to get something going so that people don't walk out<br/>
their first time, only to search for a box that doesn't exist anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that looking is part of the game and all, but I think that<br/>
would be easily solved by including a difficulty option, so that people<br/>
know what they are getting into.  If you know it's supposed to be an<br/>
easy box and you follow the clues and it isn't there, you can then move<br/>
on, whereas if you know it's supposed to be hard, then you'll search<br/>
a little more.<br/>
<br/>
Not knowing how the LbNa website is set up in terms of hosting, I don't<br/>
have any concrete ideas on languages and such.  However, as Erik pointed<br/>
out, if we ever would like maps to display locations of letterboxes (or<br/>
starting points of letterbox clues) then it'd probably be wise to stick<br/>
to a Windows based platform with MS Access as a database system. To me,<br/>
that would suggest using ASP for dynamic page generation.  Does our hosting<br/>
plan include ASP?  I haven't the slightest.  I guess we could use PHP, as<br/>
well, which a lot of people find easier. So, does our hosting plan include<br/>
PHP?  I dunno!<br/>
<br/>
So, as for general design, I'd love to hear comments on the potential work<br/>
flow of a new system.  In general, what do you think about:<br/>
<br/>
- User accounts?<br/>
- Templates for new box submission?<br/>
- Mapping of boxes?<br/>
- Comment ability?<br/>
<br/>
If this were an ideal world, what would such a system include?  I think<br/>
it's be great for each clue to have a "last found" date so that new users<br/>
could<br/>
make sure that they went to a box that still existed.  Luckily, my first<br/>
find a<br/>
week ago was there (soaking wet, but still there!)<br/>
<br/>
Some of these ideas are probably a lot harder to implement than others, but<br/>
I<br/>
don't think that a basic prototype would be tough to put out so that people<br/>
could<br/>
comment on it.  How are we going to get the current boxes into a new system?<br/>
<br/>
I've said a lot, so I'm going to sit back and listen for a couple of days so<br/>
that<br/>
everyone gets their say on this. I'm not going to take it personally if you<br/>
think<br/>
my ideas stink, so speak up.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi and thanks for your very knowledgeable input!  After reading your <br/>
ideas, I have a couple thoughts/questions:<br/>
<br/>
1) Many clue writers already do indicate the difficulty of a clue.  I <br/>
would encourage everyone who writes clues to indicate whether it is <br/>
easy, moderate, or difficult.  As you say, it helps a person to decide <br/>
how much effort to put into finding a particular box.<br/>
<br/>
2) How do you envision a "last found" notation working?  Who would be <br/>
the individual responsible for updating that information--the person <br/>
who finds a box or the person who "owns" it?  I myself do not want to <br/>
have to update my clue pages each time someone notifies me that they <br/>
have found one of my boxes.  I just don't want to spend that much time <br/>
on what is just a hobby--a very part-time hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when I hunt letterboxes, I don't want to have to report each time <br/>
I have a found a box.  Again, it's just more time at the computer, <br/>
which, for me, makes the hobby less appealing.<br/>
