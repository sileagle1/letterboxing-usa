                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been searching through the posts here and I don't think that <br/>
this has been discussed, or at least my take, but if I am merely <br/>
echoing what previous posters have said, I appologize in advance.<br/>
<br/>
I actually do both. My kids like to geocache better than letterbox, <br/>
but I love to box more than cache. For me it is about getting <br/>
outside and both activites offer a twist to the hike. And I have <br/>
found that both hobbies will sometimes take you to some new <br/>
discoveries.<br/>
<br/>
I find so far, that the quality of locations with geocaching is <br/>
lacking. Many are just dropped into a so so area, that isn't really <br/>
special. Someone just wanted to hide a GC somewhere. I find that <br/>
Letterboxers tend to be more selective in the placement and I have <br/>
not yet found a bad placement. I think that if one is going to take <br/>
time to hand carve a stamp, they have invested more into the box, <br/>
than someone who fills a plastic cantainer with household leftovers <br/>
and sticks it in the woods. There of more of these kind of geocaches <br/>
out there, However, there are some really nice ones too. Some take <br/>
the time and put nice objects in them, which when your exchange <br/>
encourages your to recipicate in kind. Some of the more experienced <br/>
hiders, really do a good job, by making puzzles and <br/>
other "waypoints" that you have to in order to find the main cache. <br/>
So it to is fun.<br/>
<br/>
Here though is the main difference for me. When you go to an area to <br/>
find a letterbox more often than not you are led down trails, by <br/>
landmarks and can experience the area, making the search and finding <br/>
the Lb almost secondary to the experience of the walk. Conversly, <br/>
with the use of coordinates, you can make a bee line for the cache <br/>
and the whole flavor of the experience becomes the treasure hunt, <br/>
and after you forund your booty, you then look up and realize that <br/>
you are in a beautful spot.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, even though, both have log books, the whole procedure of <br/>
exchanging stamps make the Lb experience more personal. You stop and <br/>
say, "Hello, thank you for taking me to this wonderful spot and <br/>
allowing me to stamp this beautiful stamp that you spent your time <br/>
carving, and in return here is mine, I hope that you like it."<br/>
<br/>
Well, that is my take. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do both also, although I have to say I don't seem to be as good at GC'ing<br/>
as I am at LB'ing.<br/>
<br/>
I much prefer LB'ing for the same reasons you say, but when I need a hunting<br/>
fix and there aren't any boxes close enough to me to be able to find them in<br/>
the time I have available, I fall back on GC'ing.  I do enjoy it, although<br/>
it frustrates me greatly because I don't seem to be able to home in as<br/>
quickly as you describe and I have to do a lot of guesswork.  I have found I<br/>
like caches that give me coords but also visual clues, so that even if my<br/>
GPS is off from the placer's, I can still get where I'm going.<br/>
<br/>
I agree about the places caches are hidden vs where boxes are hidden.  Boxes<br/>
have much more appealing spots on a general basis; however, caches have much<br/>
more creative placements in their spots (hanging in trees, that sort of<br/>
thing).<br/>
<br/>
One thing I distinctly like about GC's is that they have to be approved and<br/>
they can't be closer than xxx feet from one another.  This is the same thing<br/>
I dislike about it.  I really don't advocate requiring approval for boxes,<br/>
but I do wish sometimes that boxers wouldn't pile up a bunch of boxes in one<br/>
small area.<br/>
Another thing that's kind of cool about GC'ers is that they hand out their<br/>
cell phone numbers like it's nothing - they call them lifelines.  I was<br/>
amazed to pick up three cell phone numbers in the first month or so and it<br/>
was nice to be able to use them when I got out there and got stuck on a<br/>
cache.  LB'ers do the same, but they aren't nearly as quick about handing<br/>
them out, but I think it's more because they don't think about it than that<br/>
they are less friendly.<br/>
<br/>
GC'ers are more competitive, I've found.  And they seem to like to hunt in<br/>
groups.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have been geocaching about 3 years and letterboxing for 1 1/2 years.  The perceived <br/>
'either-or' attitude, and some animosity between LB'rs and geocachers is unfortunate and <br/>
counter-productive.   Both are fun and have their pros and cons.   The main commonality <br/>
is the 'treasure hunt' aspect. <br/>
<br/>
Many good points already made; we will try to add rather than repeat... <br/>
<br/>
It is an over-generalization, but we have observed that while letterboxers are more <br/>
creative, both with the personal stamps and the clues,  geocachers tend to be more <br/>
devious and varied in the choice of containers and style of hides (urban lamppost hides <br/>
excluded!)   Lots of people in both get competitive, but most in both are also very sociable <br/>
and helpful.  <br/>
<br/>
The quality versus quantity issue is clear.  Right now, there are tons of way too easy, <br/>
urban, drive-by geocaches.  Now, there certainly should be some, for handicapped people, <br/>
and little kids and so forth, but the pendulum seems to be far to the quantity side.   <br/>
Whatever we are hunting, with or without a GPS or other high-tech equipment, we like to <br/>
get to off-the-beaten-path places, or an interesting location we would not have found <br/>
otherwise.   One excellent example of that is 'FFFF', just outside the city limits of <br/>
Chattanooga, but I doubt we would have found it without a letterbox there. <br/>
<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue.html?gBoxId=13651.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, there are other sites that post coordinates for hunting with a GPS.  The main one <br/>
besides Groundspeak.com/Geocaching.com is Terracaching.com, which encourages much <br/>
more difficult hides and hunts.  <br/>
<br/>
The geocaching community seems to be more organized, which is of course a two-edged <br/>
sword.  If you want to know the current rules, guidelines, etc for use of a park or any <br/>
public area, the geocaching sites are a good source of information.  <br/>
<br/>
Hiding any kind of container in a National Park is generally forbidden by the NPS without <br/>
specific permission from a park superintendent, and the GC community has set some <br/>
useful precedents for this.  Likewise in some state parks.  <br/>
<br/>
That's our 4 cents worth (there are two people in Team Bear-Cat!) anyway; happy <br/>
hiding,hunting and hiking! <br/>
