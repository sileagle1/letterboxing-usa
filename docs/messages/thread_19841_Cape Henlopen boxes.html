Friday.  We found the Lighthouse series all in good<br/>
shape.  When I got back to the car I found the bag for<br/>
the log book of #4 in my back pack!  I'm going to try<br/>
to get back out there in the next few days, if any one<br/>
gets there before me please take an extra zip-lock<br/>
bag.  The box is hidden in a place where I think it<br/>
will be OK even if it rains.  We also checked on the 3<br/>
other boxes listed, all were OK.  I thought there was<br/>
one more box out on the point but the clues are not<br/>
listed anymore. Did it go missing?  I had tried to<br/>
find it once before and came up empty.  I'm not sure<br/>
if I held onto the clues or just thought I'd look them<br/>
up, but now they are gone.<br/>
