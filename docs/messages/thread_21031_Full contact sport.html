Hi LipstickChick,<br/>
<br/>
Who says you never have anything to write in a logbook?  While I wish all my <br/>
visitors a safe and enjoyable experience, such tales would make for great <br/>
reading when I'm too decrepit to get out on the trail.<br/>

I didn't tell Acorn I never had anything to write, to the contrary.  I  <br/>
always have plenty to write, just nothing beautiful and flowery like she  does.  <br/>
She practically writes poetry in other logbooks.  I, on the  other hand, can't <br/>
keep my tongue in cheek sense of humor under control.   Rather than finding <br/>
beauty in nature, I seem to stumble upon comedy in  nature.  If I have found one <br/>
of your boxes, I probably have shared it with  you.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer when people write more than just their name in my logbook.  I  know <br/>
that sometimes you are on a quest to find a particular number of boxes in a  <br/>
day. I get it, I get it, so then just write QUEST next to your name!<br/>

LipstickChick, hope you have time for a visit to one of my boxes next time <br/>
you're in town.  I like to laugh long and often.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to hear from others about interesting logbook entries.  We recently <br/>
came upon a book in which a police officer had written that this was "an <br/>
interesting find, but not what we were looking for."  In the same book, <br/>
someone without a pen had carved a message with his knife--Yikes!  (was <br/>
this who they were looking for??) In this box's sister, some Navy sailors on a <br/>
training mission found the box and signed in.<br/>

I have friends who work with Search and Rescue dogs.  Once a month or<br/>
so, they have a 'practice' get together in a park and make a day of<br/>
it.  Dogs, food, friends, etc.  Someone goes to hide in the woods and<br/>
the dog  handlers track him down.  While on a practice search in New<br/>
York State (Yes, I know where, but that would be telling!) the dog<br/>
turned ninety degrees off course (the leader of the group knew where<br/>
the 'body' was hiding) and went off in a different direction.  The dog<br/>
indicated a 'find' and the searchers found a tupperware box. :) <br/>
Thinking they had found lost property, they opened it.  It was a<br/>
letterbox.  They got the idea of the game from the instructions inside<br/>
and had the dogs 'stamp in' by putting their paws on the inkpad and<br/>
then on the notebook.  All the humans signed in as well and wrote<br/>
"Thanks for the extra practice session!  -- NYS Search and Rescue" :D :D<br/>

Do you happen to know whether that box is still in play?  I think i<br/>
might have to try and find it (assuming the logbook didn't fill up and<br/>
go away between then and now...).<br/>

I've been inactive since going back to Grad School this fall, but as<br/>
of this summer the box was still in play and the logbook only half<br/>
full.  Good luck!<br/>
