I am not sure about the Canaveral marshes rules, but I think it would <br/>
be OK. There is a board at the entrance with rules posted as I <br/>
recall.   It is a _very_ primitive park, no facilities of any kind. I <br/>
have only seen a ranger there on one occasion. I certainly would keep <br/>
her on a leash though, too much to get into out there. If you go to <br/>
Blackpoint while you are in the area it is a wildlife drive so that <br/>
shouldn't be an issue. There is a hiking trail there too, but I don't <br/>
recall what the rules are. The Blackpoint letterbox is on the drive, <br/>
not the hiking trail.<br/>
