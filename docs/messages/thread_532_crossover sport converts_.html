                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all...I'm the newbie here, but I was wondering if anyone has<br/>
tried bringing in folks to letterboxing from orienteering and/or<br/>
volksmarching?  One of the clues I saw on the site was posted<br/>
by an orienteering group at least.  It seems orienteers would<br/>
be great recruits for letterboxing--and they have extraordinarily<br/>
detailed (usually 1:10K, 1:15K, or 1:20K) topographic maps of <br/>
parks in their areas.  The other group--volksmarchers--are keen<br/>
on stamps.  They use them to register their participation in <br/>
their events in personal log books and earn awards based on how<br/>
many they complete.<br/>
<br/>
I'm working on a volksmarcher to get her to go with me to attempt<br/>
the closest box to our area.  I'm trying to lure her with the promise<br/>
that we can do the nearby year-round-event 10K volksmarch the same day!<br/>
<br/>
Kudos to everyone for all the stuff on the NAmerica page--I'm really<br/>
enjoying "reading in" and can't wait to hunt my first box!!!<br/>
