Background<br/>
Quietly hidden under the northern side of the Mt. Hope<br/>
Bridge, the Bristol Ferry Lighthouse was commissioned<br/>
in 1855 to light the narrow passage between Mt. Hope<br/>
Bay and Narragansett Bay.  In 1916, the light's<br/>
original wooden lantern was upgraded to an iron one<br/>
that was originally used in lighthouse in the Hudson<br/>
River.  The light was also raised 6 feet from it<br/>
original height of 28 feet.  <br/>
<br/>
In 1927, the light was replaced by an automated light,<br/>
which was then made obsolete just 3 years later due to<br/>
the construction of the Mt. Hope Bridge and subsequent<br/>
discontinuation of the ferry service that connected<br/>
the East Bay to Aquidneck Island.  In 1928, the<br/>
government removed the lighthouses light and the<br/>
property was sold.  The light has remained in private<br/>
hands since that time.  It most recently changed hands<br/>
again in 2000, when it sold for over $400,000. <br/>

&gt; From the southern side of the Mt. Hope Bridge, turn<br/>
&gt; onto Boyd's Lane, headed towards the Mt Hope Bridge<br/>
&gt; on/off ramp of Rt 24.  Before arriving at 24, turn<br/>
&gt; left, across from Mello's Flower Center, turn onto<br/>
&gt; Anthony Rd towards Common Fence Point.  Follow Anthony<br/>
&gt; Rd, past the Country Club, and under the railroad<br/>
&gt; bridge.  Go past VFW Post 5390, and take a left onto<br/>
&gt; Common Fence Blvd.  Follow Common Fence Blvd to a<br/>
&gt; sharp left turn at the waters edge.  Park here in a<br/>
&gt; small dirt turnout with a blue trash can and "No<br/>
&gt; Dumping" sign.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Follow the path to the beach and proceed south.  Take<br/>
&gt; time to read about the Common Fence Point Salt Marsh<br/>
&gt; Restoration project, and then jump over a small<br/>
&gt; channel from the lagoon to the sea.  This channel is<br/>
&gt; not deep, or to wide  even at high tide.  At 26 paces<br/>
&gt; to the south, you will find a well-weathered piece of<br/>
&gt; granite guarding the beach.  Standing at the bay side,<br/>
&gt; sight a rock in the bank at 62 degrees magnetic. <br/>
&gt; Under the southern corner, you will find that which<br/>
&gt; you seek.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Enjoy collecting some shells on the beach and the view<br/>
&gt; of Mt. Hope Bridge and the lighthouse nestled beneath<br/>
&gt; it.  Once you have stamped in, please carefully<br/>
&gt; re-hide the box from view and you can return to your<br/>
&gt; car the same way you came.  Continue to follow Common<br/>
&gt; Fence Blvd to its end and take a right.  At the next<br/>
&gt; end of the road, turn left.  At the end of this road<br/>
&gt; you will find the Canvas Loft  the VFW post you<br/>
&gt; passed on the way in.  Turn right here and you are<br/>
&gt; back on Anthony Rd.<br/>

designing and planing it.  It really can be addictive<br/>
;o)<br/>
<br/>
As for the stamp, I just use stadler erasers (in that<br/>
case) or somtimes the speedball pink stuff and carve<br/>
with speedball cutters.  I am not all that artistic,<br/>
so I compose the stamp image on the computer from<br/>
pictures and clipart, and then transfer it to carve.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>
