                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for the welcome.  I can definitely see the potential for a<br/>
letterboxing group in our homeschool group, too.  I thought my friends would<br/>
think I'm crazy, but they actually thought it was a neat idea!<br/>
<br/>
I saw the article in on letterboxing in Practical Homeschooling a few issues<br/>
back.  I guess it took the idea a while to germinate in my little head.<br/>
We're off to a good start now!<br/>

Welcome Kaycee from another homeschool family.  Boxing with me are my<br/>
children 9,7, and 8 months.  I started a letterboxing club with our local<br/>
homeschool support group.  We meet twice a week to hunt for a box and then<br/>
usually picnic at the same place.  Currently there are 4 other families<br/>
involved. <br/>
<br/>
Which magazine had the letterboxing article?<br/>
