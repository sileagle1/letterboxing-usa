Favorite toys from the childhood of many of my contemporaries were the acti=<br/>
on figures <br/>
and animals from the Marx Johnny West and Best of the West series.<br/>
<br/>
These 12" figures included our hero, Johnny, Jane his wife...daughter Josie=<br/>
 (and later <br/>
Janice)...his boy Elroy (no wait, that was somebody else)...his boys Jay an=<br/>
d Jamie...bad man <br/>
Sam Cobra, and noble Native Americans Geronimo, Chief Cherokee, and later F=<br/>
ighting <br/>
Eagle and Princess Wildflower. Later came Custer and the Calvary, a couple =<br/>
of Sheriffs, and <br/>
a variety of UK, Canadian and Mexican versions. These figures exhibited ful=<br/>
l articulation <br/>
and molded on clothes, and came with a host of vinyl and poly-plastic acces=<br/>
sories. The <br/>
series ran from 1965 to 1975. Somehow my parents neglected to buy these for=<br/>
 me at the <br/>
time, but like a good boomer, I am happily acquiring them now.<br/>
<br/>
This series of stamps (five so far) celebrates these figures and takes them=<br/>
 down off the <br/>
collector's shelf and puts them back into the Western landscape they love. =<br/>
Yee-haw!<br/>
<br/>
Our story continues as the cowardly bad man, Sam Cobra, flees with his boot=<br/>
y to his <br/>
hideout deep in the Spring Mountains. The aptly named trail to Robbers' Roo=<br/>
st, is accessed <br/>
from the junction of Highway 95 north and Highway 157 west, north of Las Ve=<br/>
gas about <br/>
19 miles. Go west approximately 17.5 miles to the junction with Highway 158=<br/>
, Deer Creek <br/>
Canyon Road, and travel up the mountain approximately 3.2 miles to a paved =<br/>
turnout on <br/>
the side of the road. The trail head is across the road, so be careful cros=<br/>
sing. The trail <br/>
steeply climbs about 870 feet as it hugs sheer rock cliffs leading to a ser=<br/>
ies of caves.<br/>
<br/>
At the landing point directly below the largest cave overhang on your right=<br/>
, you may <br/>
encounter rock climbers doing their acrobatics. Pick your way up and around=<br/>
 the largest <br/>
cave on a rock and gravel trail about 100 steps. You will arrive at a dirt =<br/>
trail leading off at <br/>
a bearing of 45-50 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Take this trail about 12 paces towards this bearing and arrive at a pine tr=<br/>
ee with severly <br/>
exposed roots forming steps up to another series of caves, one which kind o=<br/>
f looks like an <br/>
angry gorilla. Go up these organic steps about 13 paces and take a bearing =<br/>
of 70 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
You will notice two ways of heading towards a cave with a prominent rock in=<br/>
 front of it <br/>
forming a negative space triangle with the cave lip. Go 12 paces at 70 degr=<br/>
ees and <br/>
squeeze through a tight, thigh-high passage between two rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Enter the deepest part of the cave, and using a flashlight, examine the sma=<br/>
ll landing at its <br/>
very back. You can capture Sam Cobra who is hiding under three medium sized=<br/>
 rocks.<br/>
<br/>
If you exit the cave, there is a good spot to sit and stamp in directly acr=<br/>
oss from the <br/>
opening.<br/>
<br/>
BONUS: Marx Toys Logo Intra-Series Hitchhiker<br/>
Keep your eye out for a lil' extra stamp of the Marx Toys logo to complete =<br/>
the Best of the <br/>
West series. When you find it, stamp the logo on your Best of the West imag=<br/>
e, as shown on <br/>
the cover of the log book, and count that box as one "f" and one "hh." You =<br/>
may take the <br/>
stamp with you and leave it in the last Best of the West series box you vis=<br/>
it, otherwise <br/>
leave it for the next finder, thanks!<br/>
