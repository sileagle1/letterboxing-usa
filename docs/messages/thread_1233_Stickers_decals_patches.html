Did this question about decals/patches get answered? I would be interested in purchasing too, if the opportunity arises.<br/>

&gt; Did this question about decals/patches get answered? <br/>
<br/>
There is inertia on the issue.  First of all, who is there to ask?<br/>
I think the issue of using the LbNA logo on a patch is who owns the<br/>
rights to it.  I think Mohmers alluded to this issue when dealing<br/>
with whoever produces these things (and hit this stumbling block).<br/>
<br/>
AFAIK, Mitch and Michelle designed the logo.  Neither is on the <br/>
list now, AFAIK.  Contact info can be found in the archives, or <br/>
perhaps one can assume that it is public domain (perhaps that <br/>
is in the archives too as Jay D mentioned off-list).  The bottom <br/>
line is that someone has to research this issue in the archives <br/>
if they wish to use that logo, and no one has, AFAIK.  I, nor<br/>
anyone on the webmaster team can give that permission, I don't think<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
An alternative is to design original artwork for the patch.  The<br/>
patch need not be associated with the LbNA web site in the first<br/>
place -- there are plenty of non-LbNA linked letterboxes out there<br/>
that are just as legitimate, and a generic "letterboxing" patch may<br/>
be more appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
I guess whoever is paying for it will have to think about both <br/>
of these issues, and basically take the bull by the horns and deal<br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
