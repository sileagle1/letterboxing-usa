You make a very good point.  I don't think telling<br/>
someone to either take the list in digest form or<br/>
telling them to read it on the site is a valid<br/>
solution as it seems that the problem created by a few<br/>
shouldn't make the many resort to changing how they<br/>
receive information.<br/>
<br/>
Other lists I belong to handle this problem in various<br/>
ways.  One list limits each list member to two posts a<br/>
day.  Makes one think long and hard how they choose to<br/>
use their two posts and clears up list clutter.  That<br/>
is not a super-sized group- not much larger than this<br/>
group is. <br/>
<br/>
This causes those whose posts really are private<br/>
conversations and not pertinent to the grand scheme to<br/>
take them to private email.  To aid in this the list<br/>
is set up so that when you hit the reply button the<br/>
reply goes only to the poster you are replying to. I'm<br/>
not sure that Yahoo offers any of this to yahoogroups<br/>
listowners but it's easy to cut and paste an email<br/>
addy.<br/>
<br/>
Others do as Sandy suggests(I believe it was Sandy, my<br/>
apologies if I'm wrong) and use a sort of code to mark<br/>
the messages so that those with limited time can scan<br/>
through.  Some of the headings might be:<br/>
<br/>
CHAT:<insert specific="" topic="">, <br/>
CLUES:<insert and="" box="" name="" state="">, <br/>
QUESTION: <insert ?="" about="" and="" ins="" lb="" of="" outs="">,<br/>
LOOKING FOR: <insert are="" box="" looking<br="" or="" person="" you="">
for&gt;<br/>
NEWBIE:--great introductions or newbie questions<br/>
<br/>
could go on and on and we'd probably want to have a<br/>
majority consensus to agree on pertinent topic<br/>
headings so that we don't have a bunch of "QUESTION:<br/>
What does this topic heading mean?".<br/>
<br/>
Of course, all of this is a moot point because how the<br/>
list is run is solely up to the list owner.<br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion for those who have formed "groups"<br/>
who like to chat and discuss issues pertaining to<br/>
their groups/area/mutual interests/ personal<br/>
relationships- things generally that others might not<br/>
care to have to wade through- is to make your own<br/>
group.  It's very easy to start a yahoogroup and you<br/>
can make it as private or public as you like.  This<br/>
has been done on other occassions and so far that's<br/>
helped those who have common interests, including but<br/>
not exclusive to LB, to have a place to talk about<br/>
those things in addition to LBing.<br/>
<br/>
 My concern is that we are losing valuable members and<br/>
their insight to the minutia due to the time crunch we<br/>
all feel.  Again, only my opinion- take it or leave it<br/>
but at least consider the ideas within.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't think anybody was trying to "tell" anyone to take the list <br/>
differently, merely sharing solutions that have made it easier for <br/>
them and offering suggestions.  Many people are not aware that the <br/>
list can be received in digest form or that it does not have to be <br/>
received via e-mail at all.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone has a little different angle on what they are looking for <br/>
here...  some want to see only new boxes and clues, others are <br/>
interested in productive discussion and ideas, still others find all <br/>
of it of interest.  That is the nature of an e-mail list.  It really <br/>
is up to each individual member to find the way that works best for <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I am skeptical of imposing limits for number of posts, etc.  In <br/>
instances where I have seen this implemented, it became "all about <br/>
business" -- discussions were seldom in depth and the group lost it's <br/>
personality.  Very few posts received comments, suggestions or <br/>
replies because people were saving their allowed posts for new <br/>
threads of their own.  It would also make it difficult to "catch up" <br/>
if you have been on vacation or just not able to get to the list for <br/>
a few days.<br/>
<br/>
That's not to say there isn't room for improvement.  As already <br/>
mentioned, more concise subject lines would help, and off-line <br/>
discussions between individuals or groups would also help.  <br/>
Unfortunately Yahoo only provides a "reply" link, which replies to <br/>
the entire group.  But if you open a message, and click on the <br/>
sender's email, the reply will be sent only to them.<br/>
<br/>
As for losing valuable members...  In my opinion no member is more <br/>
valuable than another, and if someone chooses to go, that it <br/>
certainly their option.  I think Paddle2See just summed it up very <br/>
nicely in the previous message:<br/>
<br/>
"However, I love the sport of letterboxing and I love reading about <br/>
people's adventures while letterboxing. So I'm willing to put up with <br/>
the foolishness and will just learn to ignore it. It certainly isn't <br/>
worth getting worked up over."<br/>

&gt; Of course, all of this is a moot point because how the<br/>
&gt; list is run is solely up to the list owner.<br/>
<br/>
Its run pretty autocratically, as we know :-)<br/>
<br/>
Actually, list policy is that if you want to change the way the<br/>
list is run, you should to show me a poll that shows broad-based<br/>
support for your proposed change, then I'll decide ... and this <br/>
even works ... even something that I am totally against: <br/>
censoring non-members, has been implemented.  (There are a couple<br/>
of sacred cows, like moderation and attachments, but even that<br/>
is negotiable, I suppose).<br/>
<br/>
As for subject lines -- we've had the state abbr thing for two <br/>
years or so, and some people still don't use it.  People are <br/>
free to propose more of these things, but I would question their <br/>
effectiveness, and whether there will be a mountain of messages <br/>
requesting explanations, just as there are now a mountain of <br/>
requests for the state abbr thing even tho it is _already_ requested<br/>
etiquette.  I think further codes are totally unnecessary -- I can <br/>
always tell from the subject line and the poster what the general <br/>
gist of the message is, (tho I've been on the 'net for a long <br/>
time) ... <br/>
<br/>
... but don't let me discourage implementation of this idea <br/>
if people think it will be profitable ...<br/>
<br/>
As for the default reply-to:, I have no patience for people who<br/>
cannot look at who their mail is going to, and make a conscious<br/>
decision to change that if they don't like the default.  Most<br/>
of the oldbies wanted the default reply-to: to go to the list.<br/>
If your message is better sent off-list, then do it.  There are<br/>
mountains of messages on this list that, IMHO, should be off-list.<br/>
No matter how this is set, some people will want it set the other<br/>
way.  And it is only a DEFAULT.<br/>
<br/>
Some other comments --<br/>
<br/>
Some people (who shall remain nameless :-)) send way too many messages.<br/>
Show some restraint ... I'm not going to enforce a two message <br/>
limit, tho.  If you think someone sends too many messages, send them<br/>
a message off-list asking them to show restraint.  The list is<br/>
supposed to be self-moderating ...<br/>
<br/>
People overquote way too much.  Don't topquote.  Quote the piece <br/>
of the message you are replying to, and cut the rest.  The reason<br/>
for this is that top quoting makes the digest much harder to <br/>
read, and wastes bandwidth.  (and bandwidth is real -- there is<br/>
a limit to the archive space we have, and topquoting unnecessarily<br/>
eats away at this, with repeated content in the archive).<br/>
<br/>
If your message is intended for the webmasters, just send it to<br/>
the webmasters.  There are tons of these sorts of messages,<br/>
with WEBMASTERS in the subject line.  That's like sending a message<br/>
to me on the list with RANDY in the subject line.  IMHO this is <br/>
silly :-)<br/>
<br/>
So many messages are followed immediately with another message, like,<br/>
whoops, I forgot the state in the subject line, or the bearing in<br/>
my clue is wrong.  Please take the time to attempt to get your <br/>
message right the first time.  Again, this sort of thing is the many <br/>
paying for the carelessness of the few.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, all of this and more is spelled out on the page that is in<br/>
the trailer of every message.  The fact that its there, and people<br/>
ignore it, says more on this topic than I ever could ...<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, the list is self-moderating and self-organizing.  There<br/>
isn't gonna be any sort of centralized policing of the etiquette ...<br/>
<br/>
