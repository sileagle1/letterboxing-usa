                    <div class="plaintext-content">1. We just spent a few days in the San Francisco Bay area, where we completely struck out on the SF Wildlife Refuge boxes (3) and the Byxbee boxes (4). I <br/>
know that some of these have been found fairly recently, but their planters should go out and have a look for them so that their status can be updated. <br/>
The Wildlife Refuge is a national site, so I'm not sure the boxes are allowed there, anyway. I didn't look as hard as usual because of time limitations. We <br/>
met a couple hunting for the Wildlife Refuge boxes and got to make an exchange, so not a total loss.<br/>
<br/>
2. Webmasters should note that the link to the Presidio boxes is down or maybe dead. Couldn't even get directions for those.<br/>
