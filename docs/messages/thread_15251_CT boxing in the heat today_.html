three we were after, it was time to go home and hit the pool.  Music <br/>
Woman's new "Holy Cow..." is great and it is QUITE a rock <br/>
indeed!!! "Books" was a hard find, but we did it, and Freestone was <br/>
right where it's supposed to be. We had an added challenge in the <br/>
form of our grandson in his stroller. He is now stamped into 7 boxes- <br/>
and he's only 21 months old!, so for anyone following us at these <br/>
boxes, "BOO" is him. Happy Boxing Everyone from Sunshine, Swamp <br/>
Yankee, the Toad Dog, and Boo!!! <br/>
