friends.  Their last visit was the year we were married, fondly <br/>
remembered.<br/>
<br/>
We have 3 cicada stamps already: Brood X by Tempus Fugit, 17 Year <br/>
Ick by Firefly, and the great Patapsco gather event stamp by <br/>
SewSooBusy.<br/>
<br/>
Because they may not have obvious names on the listing I would be <br/>
grateful if anyone would reply or write with known Cicada carving <br/>
placements.  thedoubtfulguests at yahoo dot com  I would be very <br/>
intersted in photos of those too far to travel to (I dont' want to <br/>
start a flame war if anyone objects though).  Send privately.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who color you may be interested to know I stamped <br/>
the 17 Year Ick as a blue eyed rare.  Yes, apparently a precious few <br/>
of the critters have blue eyes.<br/>
