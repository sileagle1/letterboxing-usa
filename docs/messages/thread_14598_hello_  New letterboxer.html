                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings from Virginia!  My name is Rev. Aloysius Hoyden.  We read <br/>
about Letterboxing in Family Fun Magazine, and went out after church <br/>
today to try it out.  Tried some of the local Harrisonburg boxes, and <br/>
went 2 for 4, which would be a pretty respectable batting average.  <br/>
Found Stargazer and Charge!, but couldn't find Wild Flower or Wild <br/>
Butterfly.  Does anyone know if these are there?  They may well be, <br/>
for we are new at this.  Family Fun, indeed!  It is increasingly rare <br/>
to find a good, wholesome activity like this that the whole family <br/>
can have fun doing together.  We think we're hooked!  Now all we have <br/>
to do is get a stamp (we just found the boxes, but haven't had time <br/>
to get a stamp, we just got the current issue of the magazine a few <br/>
days ago.)  We'll return to stamp in, and we'll go back and try the <br/>
others again, if they're there.<br/>

were out that way recently and barely avoided a run-in with poison <br/>
oak.  Why do the woods have to be over-run with such unfriendly <br/>
plant species?  Wouldn't you prefer a lovely stroll through a forest <br/>
of bamboo?<br/>

Gotta run....I promised the co-workers I would buy a dozen Krispy <br/>
Kreme donuts and they are chomping at the bit.  Hope to meet you on <br/>
the trail.<br/>
