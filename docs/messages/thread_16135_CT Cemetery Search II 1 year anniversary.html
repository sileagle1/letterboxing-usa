<br/>
    1 year of letterboxing is probably equal to 5 years in any other<br/>
pastime!!<br/>
<br/>
     We loved the Gerbil Gathering, having run up against Anon at the<br/>
gathering and in his new home at the Cemetery Search 1. Cannot wait to<br/>
see what the Great Gerbil Reunion brings!<br/>
<br/>
     Hope to see you at the DEP gather on Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
     Have fun and get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

think our actual first day out letterboxing was at <br/>
Acadia Mgmt in RI looking for Jay's "Blurred Borders"<br/>
on October 5 of last year.  It never fails to amaze me<br/>
what can happen in a year. We had a great time at the<br/>
Gerbil Anon and look forward to the Reunion!<br/>
Happy Anniversary girl! and many more to come!<br/>
