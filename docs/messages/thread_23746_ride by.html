I have spent more time in the park on bike paths etc. I am not a <br/>

with my mother who loves searching for the box. The problem I have is <br/>
that she has a heart disease. So I don't feel comfortable taking her <br/>
far off the beaten path. I notice that a lot of Letterboxers are not <br/>
of the 20 yo group. neither am I. I'm not saying anyone is old. You <br/>
are as young as you feel.  Maybe others also have medical conditions <br/>
that are limiting thier ablility to make the long hikes. There must be <br/>
a reason for boxers not wanting to make the long hike. It is also <br/>
dissapointing to make a hike and the box is gone. The box is still <br/>
listed but the box is missing or retired and not reported. I don't see <br/>
how a drive by boxes makes letterboxing any less of a great adventure. <br/>

We try to do ones that the kids can go on without complaining of getting tired of walking, and ones everyone can enjoy.  Ones that have a pretty long hike, we just plan on taking the older kids, and leaving the younger ones at home.  But, with me being pregnant, some of the long ones I have to sit out as well cause of past health issues.  NO think a aranger wants to deliver a baby in the woods, or even my parents at that!! LOL  We love them all but the shorter ones are great for the younger kids who don't like long walks.  =)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all! I am a newbie to this sport and too am addicted. I can understand everyone's point of view on this topic. I actually research all the LBs in an area and plot my path to see as many as possible. If I can go to a drive-by then a short hike, ending the day with a long one... that's perfect. My side kick (2 yo) tends to sit and count rocks or ends up being carried so I like to do only 1 long hike a day. It's nice to have variation and options. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday was rainy and I NEEDED to get a LB, so I hunted the list for a drive-by. It was still exciting to sneak to the Cat Clinic in Lakewood, OH and nab the box without being seen. I've also done the Gates Mills library in Mayfield Hgts., OH. That was so cool searching the clues to locate a hollowed out book. Although I love the parks and scenic trails I've taken, those 2 also stand out as great adventures.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see some N. Ohio LBs out and about some time!<br/>
