Frankly, I think YOUR post is even less welcome than Bethany's.  No <br/>
where in that post did I see anything about whether she personally <br/>
supports the war or not, but rather she supports "that a <br/>
resolution to this conflict is fast, efficient bringing with it <br/>
peace to the region with minimal casualties on both sides."<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I think with this step the United States lost all over the world<br/>
&gt; their face<br/>
<br/>
Since YOU brought up the topic, I'll throw in my two cents that the <br/>
United States lost a lot of its credibilities years ago with such <br/>
blatent land grabs as the Mexican War or Spanish-American war.  The <br/>
United States has bullied weaker countries for over 200 years now, <br/>
and that'll probably never change.  Which, I might add, is NOT a <br/>
policy I agree with.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; In all european countries are the people this time on the street<br/>
&gt; and demonstrate against the United States, the US President and the<br/>
&gt; attack to a indipendent country.<br/>
<br/>
There are many people who protest the war but still pray for a quick <br/>
end to the war, with minimal casualties on BOTH sides, and ultimately <br/>
more stability and happiness in the world.  They may disagree with <br/>
how the United States is going about it, but I truly have a difficult <br/>
time believing that "Old Europe" is praying for a long, drawn-out war <br/>
with hundreds of thousands of casualities (on both sides) and <br/>
additional instability in the region.<br/>
<br/>
If that's really your opinion--which I'm sure it's not but your post <br/>
sounds suspiciously like it might be true--nobody on this board is <br/>
going to welcome you here.<br/>

  9 years of breaking UN laws (Iraq was doing)  When do you stop<br/>
drawing lines in the sand and take him out?   3-18-2003 that's when.<br/>
<br/>
Also you wrote,   aginst the United States????  Who cares any more as<br/>
someone somewhere 365 days a year has a demonstration against the United <br/>
States.<br/>
<br/>
  the real Facts:  The United States has given more to the World than ANY <br/>
country on the Face of this Planet 100 times over, It's the only Country <br/>
that has 28 Religions and NO ONE IS KILLING each other in the name of their <br/>
religion. (Name another country that enjoys that)<br/>
<br/>
  Every Country in the world sends their brightest students here to learn <br/>
from our schools so they can go back and help thier county (Yes even A-Holes <br/>
who learn how to fly, Learned here) so they can fly a plane into the World <br/>
Trade Center.<br/>
<br/>
    By the Way, "demonstrating" is where you gather and hold signs and maybe <br/>
sing or chant, "demonstrating" is NOT bruning down the city. That<br/>
is just a bunch of people looking to lot for themselfs and not the cause. So <br/>
when I watch the news and see people in france burning down a McDonalds I <br/>
have to laugh at them and how stupied they are.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Oh Yea, That's right, you do have the Right to burn down a city, Throw <br/>
things at the police to get your point across.  Hummm, Sounds like talking <br/>
does not work in getting your point across so you have to BURN and DESTROY <br/>
the city (I.E. how may times again was it that the UN told Iraq to give up <br/>
their arms Over the last 9 years??)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Please show your ass,  Burn the Citys down.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Love Live the USA,  And I THANK all of those country's who will at least <br/>
stand beside us during this time even if it's the right or wrong thing to <br/>
do.<br/>

I am curious to wonder why this tread is blatently posted to a chat group <br/>
devoted to letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
While I support as one poster put it...Constitutional Rights...one has the <br/>
right to "Responsible and Appropriate Freedom of Speech"...That does not <br/>
mean that one can yell Fire in a crowded movie house...nor can one intrude <br/>
on the peaceful actions of others...<br/>
<br/>
And in this case...posting political comments to a hobby chat group...<br/>

&gt;I find the tone (and insinuation) in your message both inappropriate and<br/>
&gt;offensive.  How dare you claim to speak for the entire population of the<br/>
&gt;U.S. and how dare you insinuate that those who don't believe as you do are<br/>
&gt;somehow inferior and "don't know how to think."  You are in the vast<br/>
&gt;minority in this issue - remember that.  Disagree with the current course <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;events, protest if you wish, express your opinion as often as you like, <br/>
&gt;it's<br/>
&gt;your right - but don't you dare make apologies on behalf of this country,<br/>
&gt;and don't you dare belittle those who don't "think" like you do.<br/>
