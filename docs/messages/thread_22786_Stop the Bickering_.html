<br/>
Have y'all forgotten that this is supposed to be a FUN hobby with NO<br/>
RULES (more like guidelines), and it's all what you personally make of<br/>
it? If someone wants to count finds and put them in a database and<br/>
have a find history for the boxes posted on whatever site and would<br/>
like to know if the last ten letterboxers who attempted to find a box<br/>
succeeded or didn't because it might mean a 2-hour drive, one way, and<br/>
a 1-hour hike, one way, to find a box or two that are not even there<br/>
and there isn't a lick of any civilization anywhere nearby where you<br/>
can rest your weary legs and drown your sorrows in a pint, then so be<br/>
it. If you want to use the feature, go ahead. If you don't, ignore it.<br/>
It's all what you personally make of it. For the record, I would<br/>
rather have the information available than not. This IS the 21st<br/>
Century and we have the technology.<br/>
<br/>
But really, all this incessant bickering... How does it look to<br/>
someone who just discovered letterboxing, wants to get involved and<br/>
comes here because the group is listed on numerous sites... and<br/>
finds... this infighting? I find it rather interesting that the people<br/>
who voice the negative opinions are the loudest ones of all.<br/>
<br/>
I say if you want to shout at somebody, at least have the common sense<br/>
and decency to "take it outside," so to speak, and let the rest of us<br/>
get on in relative peace. In other words, if you're going to flame<br/>
somebody like this for intruding upon your beliefs, email them off list.<br/>
<br/>
There. I'll be back in a couple of weeks to make sure y'all are<br/>
fighting again...<br/>
