We put on our shoes and socks<br/>
and went searching for a letter box<br/>
<br/>
We were in no particular hurry,<br/>
but then it started to flurry.<br/>
<br/>
Before the snow got any deepa,<br/>
we found where the box did sleepa.<br/>
<br/>
We took a stamp of the bananaconda,<br/>
an image we're rather fond-a<br/>
<br/>
Under a blanket of leaves and sticks<br/>
we bid good bye to find twenty-six.<br/>
<br/>
On the trail we had felt rather hot,<br/>
'cause we'd even found a Jackpot!<br/>
<br/>
As the snow turned into sleet<br/>
we headed home for something to eat.<br/>
<br/>
As to this terrible poem I'd....<br/>
better stop before you head for the bromide!<br/>
<br/>
We'll never replace Jack Prelutsky (sp?) that is for sure!!!  Thanks for the <br/>
fun box in the cute little park.  We can only imagine how nice it is in the <br/>
summer when the leaves hide the houses!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the snow and happy holidays!  BeMa<br/>
