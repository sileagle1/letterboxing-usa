                    <div class="plaintext-content">We placed our first letterbox today (we have found four and all of our<br/>
family, except perhaps the baby, have been greatly enjoying this new<br/>
game). This is quite an easy hunt, as befits a letterbox hidden by<br/>
several small children and their parents who are far too silly to<br/>
really qualify as grownups -- but though the hunt is not too<br/>
challenging this will make for a pleasant cool and splashy hike for<br/>
a warm summer day. These clues will be mirrored at our family website<br/>
http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/mac47/letterbox.html but please do<br/>
put them on the letterboxing website too. Thanks! The Colvin family <br/>

TAUGHANNOCK FALLS LETTERBOX:<br/>
<br/>
Taughannock Falls is located in Ulysses, NY, part of the popular<br/>
Finger Lakes Region of central New York. The falls is part of<br/>
Taughannock State Park located between the Village of Trumansburg<br/>
(part of the Ulysses Township), and the city of Ithaca. <br/>
<br/>
The falls are formed by a rock bed creek entering the lake and<br/>
surrounded by a glen with walls climbing to 400 feet (120 meters). The<br/>
cataract has a drop of 215 feet (66 meters), one of the highest east<br/>
of the Rocky Mountains slightly higher even (25 ft., 8 m) than Niagara<br/>
(American side), but they cannot be compared because it has much<br/>
(MUCH) smaller volume. Taughannock is interesting year round - the<br/>
falls and gorge create a natural amphitheater with dense spray rising<br/>
from the bottom often shrouding the lower part of the cataract in<br/>
mist. The name "Taughannock" originates either from that of the<br/>
Delaware Indian chief Taughannock or as the Delaware word taghkanic<br/>
("great fall in the woods"). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Park is open all year Mon-Fri, 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM; nights and<br/>
weekends during summer with camping from March to mid October. The Rim<br/>
trail closes in winter.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  The park is located about 8 miles North from Ithaca or 4<br/>
miles South from Trumansburg along Route 89. From the New York State<br/>
Thruway, take Exit 41 to 318 East for 4 miles. Head South on Route 89<br/>
for 35 miles. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(This information came from a website describing the park,more details<br/>
can be found at http://www.taughannock.com/ )<br/>
<br/>
There is a fee for using the parking area nearest the Gorge Trail. You<br/>
can avoid this by parking at the Falls overlook and hiking down<br/>
(consult map at the parking lot, this will add about two extra miles<br/>
to your hike) -- we do not suggest  you do this with many small<br/>
children. <br/>
<br/>
Come prepared to do a bit of wading. Water shoes are highly<br/>
recommended.<br/>
<br/>
When you enter the park, change diapers, dole out snacks, put on water<br/>
shoes and bathing suits if you haven't already, and confine children<br/>
under two to backpacks. Start upstream along the Gorge Trail, crossing<br/>
the meadow and passing the first, smaller waterfall with the no<br/>
swimming sign at the foot of the stairs. We would tell you how many<br/>
paces this is, but we weren't sure whether to use daddy-sized,<br/>
mommy-sized, or child-sized paces, and everyone was trying to count at<br/>
once, and the baby was making noise in the backpack -- so everyone<br/>
lost track of their paces, except for the four year old. He says it<br/>
was 1002 paces, but we don't believe him.<br/>
<br/>
Continue along the Gorge Trail, heading upstream with the stream on<br/>
your right. There will be a steep drop with a stone wall between the<br/>
trail and the stream. The wall ends just before trees obscure your<br/>
view of the stream. Cut through the trees and descend to the stream<br/>
bed. You will notice that some of the water is not moving, because it<br/>
is carved out of stone. (At least, this was the explanation of one<br/>
member of our expedition.)<br/>
<br/>
Wade through the stone water or the running water -- whichever you<br/>
think will be easier -- until you find five in a row on the south side<br/>
of the stream. This is a good place to wade across to the opposite<br/>
bank. Continue upstream, travelling on the north side The trail will<br/>
still be obscured by trees on the opposite bank.<br/>
<br/>
You are getting close when the trees end and a stone wall appears<br/>
again on the south bank, with the trail above it. Continue as far as<br/>
you can on the rock flats of the north bank, then climb the gentle<br/>
rocky slope into the trees at your right. You are in view of the trail<br/>
here, so be discreet. Remember, "a rolling stone gathers no moss."<br/>
<br/>
Now that you have added your stamp, continue upstream to enjoy the<br/>
falls!<br/>

Our family was going to place at Taughannock in the next few weeks, but you <br/>
beat us to it!<br/>
<br/>
Now we have another box near home to go look for. The kids will be so happy <br/>
(especially after driving for hours to find two today). Thanks!<br/>
