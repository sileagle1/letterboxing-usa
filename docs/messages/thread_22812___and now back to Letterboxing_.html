<br/>
we went looking for a 5 box series in Hopkinton St Pk  MASS<br/>
took us 2 1/2 hours to find 3 boxes<br/>
<br/>
the PLANTER had noted that box 3/4 had been "reported" missing<br/>
and we tried to find them "JUST IN CASE" the searchers had not looked hard enough<br/>
but they seem to be gone<br/>
<br/>
we appreciated the missing notice and enjoyed our "SEARCH" anyway<br/>
what a great day to be out in the autumn woods<br/>
<br/>
hope everyone had the chance to get out<br/>

We did not get out as early as I'd hoped--but that was because I was off snagging First Finder for hexacat's new Lenape Indian boxes (very cool, evil clues, great stamps).  So instead of the major hike, we opted to go to Palmyra for Silent Doug's The Cove.  Didn't go as far as stamping in, but he was pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
He even agreed to another "I can keep up with you" outing.  (I just have to decide which mountain.)  But he only put up with getting the one box &amp; was not fooled by the suggestion of a drive-by farther north/"on the way home"....<br/>
