What more could you ask forgreat beaches, marshes, dunes, <br/>
cemeteries, lighthouses, cedar swamps, bike trails, bridges, herons, <br/>
unusual towers, and abandoned drive-in movie theaters!  Thanks to all <br/>
the oh-so-creative hiders/carvers.  There were many more I hoped to <br/>
find, but ran out of time or energy, so I will just have to go back. <br/>
For those who asked me to report, all of the following boxes are in <br/>
place and in good shape:<br/>
<br/>
Buzzard's Bay: Bourne Bridge<br/>
Bourne: Belmont Rock, Herring Run<br/>
Wellfleet/South Wellfleet: Long Pond, Tandem Mates, Wizard of the <br/>
Waves, Cook's Tour, Stonecroft<br/>
Eastham: Nauset Light, Three Sisters Light<br/>
Brewster: Spruce Hill, Water Boatman, Window on the Bay<br/>
Dennis: Black Crow at Quivet, Forgotten Road, Kraken in Cape Cod Bay, <br/>
Ghost Train, Lady Slipper, Scargo Tower, The Dead Drive-In<br/>
Yarmouthport: A Very Gorey Letterbox, Heron's Haven<br/>
Sagamore: The Glassworks, Gateway to the Cape Cod Canal, Sagamore Hill<br/>
<br/>
There were only three boxes I looked for but didn't find:  Chatham <br/>
Light (it was cold, raining, and windy, and after searching in the <br/>
designated spot for nearly a half hour and getting soaked I gave up<br/>
too many rocks, too little time).  Chatham Rooster 2: Deanne, I saw <br/>
only one yellow pipe (the clue mentions two).  Ended up at a spot <br/>
where the trail forked; it dead-ended in both directions shortly <br/>
thereafter. Gave up! So the town of Chatham was a bust for <br/>
letterboxes, not to mention overrun with tourists.  Got out of there <br/>
and had a great time in Dennis and Yarmouthport! <br/>
<br/>
There was also a "bike it" box on the CCRT that was supposed to be <br/>
1.2 miles from Nickerson State Park.  At that point I was on foot, <br/>
not on my bike, and walked for 25 min. without seeing the <br/>
boulder/plaque specified. It was the last box of a VERY long day, my <br/>
legs were killing me, so I decided to turn around. I don't remember <br/>
the name of this one (I gave away a bunch of cluesread on), but it <br/>
was in the same series as Tandem Mates, Scooter Boy, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I met letterboxers on the trail twicefirst Kstar and her friend <br/>
Andrew on Saturday, as we converged on the Ghost Train box in Dennis. <br/>
I had the clue for the Lady Slipper, which they didn't know about, so <br/>
we all three hunted that one together.  By then the rain had stopped, <br/>
but the fog nearly caused us to miss the bridge mentioned in the clue!<br/>
<br/>
Today I met two very new letterboxers, Mike and Lucinda of <br/>
Hubbardston, MA, at the Gateway to the Cape Cod Canal box in <br/>
Sagamore.  They have the whole coming week on the Cape but had just a <br/>
few clues, so we went back to my car and I handed them a big stack of <br/>
all the clues/boxes I had found.  They knew about LBNA but had not <br/>
heard about gatherings or hitchhikers or this list, so I gave them <br/>
the rundown.<br/>
<br/>
And that's the end of my Cape Cod report!  Thanks to everyone who <br/>
sent me suggestions before I left. There were some boxes that were <br/>
highly recommended that I didn't get to, so I know I will be going <br/>
back.<br/>
