                    <div class="plaintext-content">They sure as heck felt like boats, those boots.  But with the proper <br/>
socks I was ready to roam (as long as it wasn't too terribly far from <br/>
the car).  The moors, when we were out there, were densely misted and <br/>
we were too chicken and too cautious to really get out there.<br/>
<br/>
The map, actually, is a necessity though you have to know how to <br/>
decipher it for it to be of help.  It did have two letterboxes listed <br/>
but they're permanent fixtures.  One is a monument kind of thing to <br/>
the first letterbox ever placed.  We did not wander that far into the <br/>
moor though.  (You have to wander through a firing range to get to it <br/>
and that was WAY over our heads).  But thanks for the tip . . . all <br/>
future maps will be tucked away discreetly.  :o)  <br/>
<br/>
So I take it that no maps are allowed in the States?  Tell you one <br/>
fantastic difference between what we experienced in Dartmoor and what <br/>
I've seen on the LBNA website.  Americans give CLUES!  In the UK you <br/>
don't get written clues until you've found 100 boxes.  That's a HECK <br/>
of a lot of pub crawling!  But it was great.  I'll do it again in a <br/>
heartbeat.<br/>
<br/>
Even still we did find 8 boxes on the moor just by wandering around <br/>
on our own.  A fantastic experience that I look forward to <br/>
perpetuating here in the States as soon as my English partner gets <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;     Nice Boots! Or should I say Boats! When you come to the US <br/>
you've <br/>
&gt; got to have the map discretely hidden. Otherwise you scream NOVICE!<br/>
&gt; If you're from GB then we'll let it slide. But if you're from the <br/>
USA <br/>
&gt; then I'd say you are delightfully cheating! Have fun wherever you <br/>
&gt; land. <br/>
&gt;     The moors look ominous. I'm not to sure I'd feel comfortable <br/>
&gt; there. I'm for the pub crawling. The only thing that's scary there <br/>
&gt; are the leering drunks!<br/>

&gt; &gt; How cool is it that this sport (is that what we call it?) <br/>
satisfies <br/>
&gt; &gt; my love of riddles and snooping and rubberstamping!    <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, here I am.  I am a neophyte Letterboxer but I had the <br/>
great <br/>
&gt; &gt; experience of cutting the first of my babyteeth on the moor.  <br/>
First <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox found in a Museum (is that cheating???) in Okehampton, <br/>
&gt; &gt; Dartmoor.  We found our next in the Plume &amp; Feather . . . a pub.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Gotta love that.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We eventually wandered out onto the moor even though it was misty <br/>
&gt; as <br/>
&gt; &gt; heck and the squish under our boots was NOT the marsh.  Hey, it's <br/>
&gt; &gt; gotta be love when a priss like me doesn't mind wading through <br/>
&gt; horse <br/>
&gt; &gt; and sheep poodey looking for tupperware!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; All tolled we walked away from Dartmoor with 40 stamps in our <br/>
&gt; &gt; journals.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Next stop?  AMERICA!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; PS  The mail letterboxing idea is fab!  I'd love to join in.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; PPS  BTW, there was a box under that rock to the left.  :o)<br/>
