Your points are quite valid, of course, and have caused me to re-consider my <br/>
earlier statement.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, I will not be so quick to recommend that all letterbox visits <br/>
be followed up with an acknowledgement from the visitor. Such <br/>
acknowledgements could, indeed, provide undesirable hints to the location of <br/>
the box... especially when posted to the entire list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your comments.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

&gt;  &gt; Any time a box is found, the finder will be doing a great service to <br/>
&gt;  &gt; the entire letterboxing community by either contacting the author of<br/>
&gt;  &gt; the box or posting a note about their find on this list. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Now this is a matter of personal choice. Not to mention the list<br/>
&gt;  volume this would generate, I think keeping silent is more fun.<br/>
&gt;  Keep some secrecy going. I think its cool to go out in the _field_<br/>
&gt;  and discover who has visited your box rather than a e-mail to the<br/>
&gt;  whole world. I certainly never send notes when I find boxes for<br/>
&gt;  this reason (except once in a while a personal note to the author,<br/>
&gt;  or a very cryptic note that only those with ears to hear will pick<br/>
&gt;  up on :-)). Its just more fun this way.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Another problem with this is it can give away mystery boxes. If <br/>
&gt;  I say "wow, I found mystery box X", that gives away to the astute<br/>
&gt;  more information about the box then they otherwise would have had.<br/>
&gt;  Its a spoiler. These things matter to the people hunting and hiding<br/>
&gt;  these boxes. All someone would have to do is look at the USOF A <br/>
&gt;  meet schedule to see where the mystery boxes be in my case :-)<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Its interesting that the armchair treasure hunting folks will<br/>
&gt;  actually try to backdoor finds by researching travel itineraries,<br/>
&gt;  etc, of the hiders. The hiders have to make bogus travel plans and<br/>
&gt;  trips to avoid this. Its interesting how much can be given away<br/>
&gt;  by these comments when playing at the cryptic box level. <br/>
&gt;  Unfortunately, I've backdoored a couple of boxes myself due to <br/>
&gt;  careless comments on this list. I wonder how many I've given away ...<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Loose lips sink ships :-)<br/>
