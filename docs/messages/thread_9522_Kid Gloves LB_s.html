let the planter of Kid Gloves in DC know the condition of their <br/>
boxes. I did some letterboxing in DC on October 22 and found Kid <br/>
Gloves #'s 2 and 3. #3 was in great condition and had an addition, as <br/>
someone left their stamp behind (not as a hitchiker though). #2, <br/>
however, was wet and soggy and the book was all runny with water. <br/>
Sorry. I am from Texas and was leaving the next day, so I couldn't <br/>
help the situation. Just wanted to let you know.<br/>
