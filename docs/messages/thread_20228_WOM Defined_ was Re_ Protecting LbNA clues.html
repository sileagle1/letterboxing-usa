[We wanted to offer a further explanation of WOM (Word Of Mouth) <br/>
letterboxes and clues.  We've gone out of our way to keep a reference <br/>
of "underground" clues. Partially because we ask very nicely, and <br/>
partially because we've become friendly with several of the pioneers <br/>
in CT.....no, don't ask for copies, these kinds of clues seek you <br/>
out!]<br/>
<br/>
Here goes!:    Word of Mouth clues take on many forms. They can be <br/>
entirely verbal (i.e. look under X tree by Y Lake).   They can <br/>
be "unpublished" which means they are in print but not listed on <br/>
letterboxing.org and not open for discussion on lists.  They can be <br/>
also be a bonus clue...for example we just received a WOM clue as <br/>
thanks for reporting on someone's box condition for one series. <br/>
<br/>
Essentially word of mouth is a wide open topic that will go as far as <br/>
the imagination can take you.  The only limits are that they don't <br/>
get posted online and discussed online. Of course, we've seen certain <br/>
WOM's talked about extremely subtly so you would not even know <br/>
someone was referring to a box. Its truly a fascinating aspect of the <br/>
game and the secrecy is indeed one of the neatest parts of it!<br/>
