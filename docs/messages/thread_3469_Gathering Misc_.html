                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks again to everyone who helped out last Saturday.  It was <br/>
definitely a group effort.  I cannot thank RIBNAG, Carol, Wanda and <br/>
Pete enough for all they did.  Special thanks to whomever ordered the <br/>
fantastic sunset.  I can hardly wait to see ESAK's pics.  Camping was <br/>
fun but cold.  Dan and Melissa, Jay Drew, Tom Cooch and my family had <br/>
three prime spots together overlooking the water.  Burlingame is a <br/>
wonderful place to be after the summer crowds leave. <br/>
<br/>
Alan from Axtown suggested that we try and have two Gatherings per <br/>
year in New England, which I think is a great idea.  Aili, Sleeping <br/>
Giant would be a wonderful location.  (of course I will go to <br/>
northern NE any chance I get - except black fly season).  I haven't <br/>
been in that area of CT in years.  Just let me know when, where and <br/>
what I can do to help.  To paraphrase the K. Costner movie, "Have it <br/>
and they will come."  And, no, it was Wanda who remarked that she <br/>
assumed you were blonde.<br/>
