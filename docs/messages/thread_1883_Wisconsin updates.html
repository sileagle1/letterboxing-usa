                    <div class="plaintext-content">At long last I've compiled the latest on letterboxes<br/>
in Wisconsin.  Quite a few are missing and will need<br/>
to be replaced in the spring, but anything not noted<br/>
here as missing or moved is still out there where the<br/>
current clues say they are.<br/>
<br/>
1. Madison Rocky Horror Letterbox is gone.  It would<br/>
need replacing anyhow, as the Majestic Theater it<br/>
commemorates the closing of is open again!  (Whether<br/>
they'll play RHPS on Saturday nights is not known<br/>
yet.)<br/>
<br/>
2. Aztalan Letterbox is reported missing as well.  It<br/>
too will be replaced this summer.<br/>
<br/>
3. Twelve Foot Falls has been reported missing, but it<br/>
could just be a terribly vague clue.  Letterboxers<br/>
from the UP of Michigan have tried and failed to find<br/>
it thus far.<br/>
<br/>
4. Sherwood Point Lighthouse Letterbox is definitely<br/>
gone.  (It was one of my best stamps too!) I'll<br/>
replace it this summer.  In the meantime, Dierdra<br/>
placed a letterbox in the same general area: "Cabot<br/>
Point Letterbox.  Follow the road to the end of Cabot<br/>
Point.  There in the rocks to the right is the<br/>
letterbox."  Cabot Point is the end of the same little<br/>
penninsula that is Sherwood Point near Sturgeon Bay.<br/>
<br/>
5. The La Salle Park Letterbox, just north of Algoma,<br/>
is gone.  It will be replaced in summer.<br/>
<br/>
6. Dierdra has placed another letterbox for the<br/>
Sturgeon Bay Shipping Canal on the opposite shore from<br/>
mine.  The clue is currently just a link to her<br/>
message on the talk list, so here it is again: "From<br/>
the 10+00 marking on the west side breakwater, go<br/>
towards the bunch of trees at the end.  26 steps to<br/>
the right on the beach brings you to the letterbox."<br/>
<br/>
7. The Chanticleer Guest House Letterbox has a slight<br/>
clue change as the box has been moved since its<br/>
original placement: "Follow the path starting at the<br/>
gazebo and into the woods.  Go over the little bridge<br/>
onto the trail.  After a woodpile and a few beautiful<br/>
trees, there will be a circle of stones on the right<br/>
side of the trail along the edge of the trees. <br/>
Nestled in this circle you will find the letterbox."<br/>
<br/>
8. UWGB Arboretum #1 has been moved from its previous<br/>
location, and thankfully rediscovered.  (I didn't move<br/>
it, and I don't know who did, but I'm grateful to<br/>
those who found it again.) I'll be putting it back in<br/>
it's proper place soon, so there's no need to change<br/>
the clue at this time.  The temporary clue is as<br/>
follows: "Take the south trail to a double trunked<br/>
cedar tree on the right of the path.  Behind it is a<br/>
9-trunked cedar tree.  The box is between the two<br/>
trees."<br/>
<br/>
9. UWGB Shorewood Golf Course Letterbox and Bay Shore<br/>
Letterbox are reported missing.<br/>
<br/>
10. Finally, the Green Isle Park Letterbox went<br/>
missing quite a long time ago, but was replaced by 8<br/>
new letterboxes which, when stamped in the right order<br/>
on your paper, make a larger picture.  Unfortunately,<br/>
quite a few of these 8 have already disappeared!  (The<br/>
dangers of suburban letterboxing.)  The "letter" of<br/>
each box tells you where on your page to place the<br/>
stamp for the larger picture.  Here are all the clues<br/>
anyway, with notation for the missing ones.<br/>
  A. On the corner of E. River Dr. and St. Joseph St.<br/>
there is a street lamp.  With your back to the post,<br/>
walk foreward to the trees.  (Lonewolf tried to find<br/>
this one and states it is gone.)<br/>
  F. From Box A follow E. River Dr. to Allouez Ave. <br/>
Turn left onto Allouez Ave.  To your right, before the<br/>
bridge, is a small parking lot.  Park there for the<br/>
remainder of the boxes.  (You *can* park in other<br/>
places if you want, but then you miss the point of<br/>
walking the trail.) Walk to the first bench on the<br/>
path.  Right behind the bench is the box.  (Or not, as<br/>
it too is reported missing.)<br/>
  B. Follow the path further.  You will cross a few<br/>
more wooden plank paths.  When you are on the last<br/>
planks before the pedestrian bridge you will see some<br/>
trees on your left.  Just before these planks end the<br/>
letterbox is under your feet.<br/>
  G. (This one is definitely missing, and needs a<br/>
better hiding spot anyway.)<br/>
  E. Keep walking through Green Isle Park southward. <br/>
Once under the first of two highway overpasses look<br/>
for a group of rocks where the top rock is slightly<br/>
up.  There protected is the box.  Continue under the<br/>
highway for the next letterbox.  (This one possibly<br/>
missing too.)<br/>
  D. When the lone pine tree is on your right just<br/>
after the wooded area, walk toward the food and<br/>
lodging sign near the highway.  Just before the sign,<br/>
in a big brush pile, is the box.<br/>
  C. When coming to a wooded section of the path, you<br/>
will find two trees that form a U.  There underneath<br/>
it facing the water is the box.  (Lonewolf says this<br/>
one is missing too.)<br/>
  H. Coming up on the next overpass at Hoffman Rd, on<br/>
the right side is a huge boulder with a surprise for<br/>
you.  Move the smaller stones to find the prize.<br/>
<br/>
Place the stamps for this series in the following<br/>
order to form a larger picture:<br/>
  A  B<br/>
  C  D<br/>
  E  F<br/>
  G  H<br/>
<br/>
I realize that a great many Wisconsin letterboxes are<br/>
missing, but they'll be replaced before too terribly<br/>
long, and with new ones to keep them company.  I'll<br/>
keep you updated on when these get replaced.  In the<br/>
meantime, Dierdra has sent a letterbox to be hidden by<br/>
a friend of hers in Koln, Germany (Or Cologne for<br/>
those of us who prefer the English spelling.)  That's<br/>
going to be one of those orphan boxes that doesn't get<br/>
checked very often by her I think.<br/>
Thanks so much for updating the Wisconsin map with<br/>
these clues.  The new web page design looks fantastic!<br/>
