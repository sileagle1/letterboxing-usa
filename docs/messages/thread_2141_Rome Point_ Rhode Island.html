                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good news for southern New Englanders.  Rome Point, site of the <br/>
Dolphins at Daybreak LB, was just donated to the state of Rhode <br/>
Island by the local power company, Narragansett Electric.  The area <br/>
will named the John Chaffee Preserve, after the late senator who was <br/>
an environmental activist.  It is a wonderful 230 acres of land with <br/>
close to two miles of shoreline on Narragansett Bay.  <br/>
<br/>
Previously it has been officially closed to the public but <br/>
unofficially those that knew about it would hike down to enjoy one of <br/>
the last undeveloped pieced of shoreline on the Bay.  In the winter <br/>
as you are returning to your car people heading to the beach will <br/>
stop and ask you if the seals are out.  On sunny days they like to <br/>
sun on the rocks and talk loudly.  It truly is a wonderful location <br/>
and I am glad that it will officially be available for all to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Now I will have to re-write my story, though...<br/>
