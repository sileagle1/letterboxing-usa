&gt;&gt; A BILL TO AMEND THE CODE OF LAWS OF SOUTH CAROLINA, 1976, BY ADDING<br/>
&gt;&gt; SECTION 16-17-605 SO AS TO DEFINE THE TERMS "GEOCACHE", "GEOCACHING",<br/>
&gt;&gt; AND "LETTERBOXING", TO PROVIDE THAT IT IS UNLAWFUL TO ENGAGE IN<br/>
&gt;&gt; GEOCACHING OR ETTERBOXING IN CEMETERIES, ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES, OR ON<br/>
&gt;&gt; THE HISTORIC PROPERTIES OF THE STATE, AND TO PROVIDE A PENALTY.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From reading responses, I'd like to point out that this is really<br/>
&gt; rotten grammer.  It's vague.  Does that mean that only state-run<br/>
&gt; cemeteries, archeological sites, and historic areas would be outlawed?<br/>
&gt;  Or all cemeteries, archeological sites, and historic areas IN the<br/>
&gt; state would be outlawed?  Federal or private cemeteries, archeological<br/>
&gt; sites, and historic areas might still be fair game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But because of the crummy grammer (which you'd think lawyers and such<br/>
&gt; would be VERY picky about), it's not really clear which it refers to.<br/>
&gt;  It's an important distinction!<br/>
