already has a letter box (thanks to the Drew clan).  My question is <br/>
this...  The trail system is large and could easily support another <br/>
box.  Is it ok to add one of our own in another location?  It could <br/>
easily be a good 45 minutes hike from the existing one so it's not <br/>
like you would be tripping over one, trying to find the other.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
