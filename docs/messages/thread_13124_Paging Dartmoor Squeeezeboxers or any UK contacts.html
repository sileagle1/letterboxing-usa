<br/>
I'm returning to live in England after 2 1/2 years in the US where I <br/>
discover the fun of letterboxing. Can you give me any pointers as to <br/>
how I can get started boxing on Dartmoor. If I have to find 100 <br/>
boxes before I can obtain clues, how do I go about it?<br/>
<br/>
e-mail me off-list if you prefer Jampotsii@yahoo.com<br/>

Thanks<br/>

Ireland in the middle of June.  We'll be spending almost a week in <br/>
the New Forest area, and I'd love to do some letterboxing while we're <br/>
there, if there are any boxes in that area.  The only contact for New <br/>
Forest boxes has evidently changed email addresses though; my email <br/>
to him was bounced back.  If anyone has any experience in this <br/>
location, or hints where to find clues, I'd really appreciate it! <br/>
Unfortunately, I don't think we'll have time to get to Dartmoor this <br/>
trip, so if anyone has any links to England/Ireland/non-Dartmoor <br/>
boxes, I'd really appreciate them! Thanks!<br/>
