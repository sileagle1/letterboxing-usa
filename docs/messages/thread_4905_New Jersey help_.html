Princeton is just five minutes south of the point where Somerset, Middlesex, <br/>
and Mercer counties all meet. The Rutgers Garden boxes (which were fun to <br/>
find!) are just under a half-hour's drive north from Princeton on Route 1 North <br/>
(20 minutes if you drive with a lead foot), so it's quite easy to go up there.<br/>
