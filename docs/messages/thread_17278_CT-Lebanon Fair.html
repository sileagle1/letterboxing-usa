&gt; I was wondering if there would be enough interest in a series of <br/>
boxes at the Lebanon Fair in August. <br/>
<br/>
We have done series at Tolland County 4-H fair twice with great <br/>
success.( 50 boxers stamped guest book) Last year we didn't do one so <br/>
we wouldn't conflict with a gathering in Mass or Maine can't remember <br/>
which now. Anyway we had planned to do one again this year but if <br/>
your doing yours maybe we won't our fair is usually the same weekend. <br/>
It worked really well and each box we did brought them to a different <br/>
part of the fair. Clues were in plastic pages in our tent and  there <br/>
was only the one set for each box so folks wouldn't be hunting when  <br/>
others had the box out. When finished they returned the clues to the <br/>
tent and picked up a new set. We had an event stamp there and guest <br/>
book as well and a few HH's passed through that weekend as well.   <br/>
Have fun with it if you need any other ideas or help just contact <br/>
me.  carol - Leader of the Pack<br/>
