Norfolk Va with family.  We were able to do some letterboxing.  We <br/>
found the Hermitage's Hermit, Oceanview, The Constant Trees, Green <br/>
Tea, St. Paul's Cannonball, and Kermit's Cousins Letterboxes.  All <br/>
were in great shape and in beautiful spots.  We drop the Creepiest <br/>
Hitch Hiker off, and released the Scardy Cat Hitch Hiker.  We also <br/>
got an exchange with new letterboxers Hands &amp; Feet.  Norfolk was a <br/>
great place to relax for the weekend, we should be going there again <br/>
maybe in July.  Special thanks to Robin of the Russ Clan for all your <br/>
help.  God Bless Teach &amp; Preach (Little Piggy &amp; Nappy Kitty also)<br/>
