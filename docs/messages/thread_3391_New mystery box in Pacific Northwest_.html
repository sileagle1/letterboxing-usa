a "dark and creepy" box for it.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, my newest letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Name: Temple of Terror<br/>
Placed: September 29, 2001<br/>
Location: Somewhere in the Pacific Northwest<br/>
URL: <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Letterboxing/templeOfTerror.html<br/>
<br/>
This is probably the most difficult clue I've ever created for a <br/>
letterbox, so if anybody actually finds it, I'd LOVE to hear about it <br/>
and what you thought of the clue!  =)<br/>

Okay, the clue might be a little corny, but it's certainly not boring!  <br/>

I doubt this box will be found for a very, very long time, but if <br/>
anyone can prove me wrong, I'd love to hear about it!<br/>

one?<br/>

This is only my 81st find.  If you counted ALL of the boxes on my <br/>
website, not all of them are mine.  Some were planted by <br/>
Amanda (from Seattle!) but we combined ours into a single <br/>
series.  The African Safari Series shows up twice--both in <br/>
Oregon and Washington since the series spans two states.  And <br/>
the Columbia River Scenic Hwy Falls boxes I don't really count <br/>
as placed either, since they were originally created by Der Mad <br/>
Stamper and I just copied his stamp images.<br/>
<br/>
But I've found 203 boxes now, and I meant to carve a new <br/>
signature stamp to celebrate my 200th stamp like I did for my <br/>
100th, but never got around to it.  Maybe I should just wait until <br/>
250, which is a nice rounder number when you consider isn't a <br/>
quarter of 1000, which is much cooler than saying it's a fifth of <br/>
1000.  =)<br/>
