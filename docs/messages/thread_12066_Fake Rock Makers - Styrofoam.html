Tonight at Michael's Craft Store, I bought some "Ovencraft Clay" and <br/>
will be trying it out for microboxes first. It supposedly fires at <br/>
350F in the oven. Obviously, I have to make sure to take out the film <br/>
cannister first before firing. Then I have to see if the cannister <br/>
will fit back in the hole. This stuff again warns of needing sealer <br/>
if it is going to be exposed to water. It is terra cotta colored but <br/>
can be painted. We shall see.<br/>

I spray painted the first two coats of the granite paint on the <br/>
celluloclay boxes tonight. Not very convincing yet. Then again, folks <br/>
see what they want to see. I think this will come with practice. When <br/>
I get a final spackle and then the sealer, I shall post the pics up <br/>
here. I think I also want to experiment with picking up some real <br/>
rock dust and coating the outside of the ovencrafted clay. Make some <br/>
terrain specific rocks to blend in.<br/>
<br/>
Or is this all just crazy? I am going to a lot of trouble designing <br/>
stamps and writing esoteric clues for my Middle Earth series. I would <br/>
rather not have yahoos find them by mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Any more info on carvable stone would be appreciated.<br/>

I would definitely not use styrofoam for anything out-doors. Its<br/>
trashy stuff, and there's far too much of it out there in the woods<br/>
and streams already.<br/>
<br/>
It probably would be a lot easier just to gather a few real rocks and<br/>
stack them up to hide the letterbox. But if you're willing to take the<br/>
time to put it together, there's something very clever about a<br/>
realistic fake rock that could make for a fun letterbox!<br/>

I agree with the business of no styrofoam. The fake rock company is <br/>
cool. Sorry, but the rodent control squicks me out to the max, maybe <br/>
because my Fool is a Mouse. We badgers do take care of mice, you know.<br/>
<br/>
$10 for one rock is a bit much but they are better looking than my <br/>
first attempt. Still, we COULD buy commercial stamps, too. I think I <br/>
shall keep rocking on.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow we are doing the Nojoqui Falls and the Medicito series. We <br/>
are also planting the Isla Vista Juggling Festival box then. And I am <br/>
just about to start planting my Middle Earth series.<br/>
<br/>
