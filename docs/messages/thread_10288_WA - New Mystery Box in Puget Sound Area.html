<div>I've planted a new box somewhere in the Puget Sound area:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>Mystery Box: "Forest Runner"<br/>City: ???<br/>County: 
???<br/>Washington</div>
<div>Placed by: Sun Seeker<br/><br/>Location:  This box is placed in one of 
my favorite places to go running.  Its on private property that has public 
access, so I thought I'd make it a ( W ) mystery 
box.  Besides, letterboxers are no-impact, right?  There are many 
trails (HQ) in this place which criss-cross through forested areas near 
I-5.  Its a popular area (FW) for runners, walkers, and dog lovers.  
There is a lot of pretty (TREES) scenery and even a lake.  Still can't 
figure it out?  Are you (STUMPED)?   Best do some 
(RESEARCH)!</div>
<div><br/>"Forest Runner" clues:  <br/><br/>This stamp is actually 
based on a photograph I took of my daughter while planting the Spanaway Lake 
box.  (OK, so I omitted the little duckies in the background)  I had 
intended to plant it when she ran in the state cross country meet last November, 
but I couldnt find much of a forest in Pasco.  So, I brought it back 
home.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just east of the freeway on 336th, you'll find ample parking on both 
sides of the road.  At the crosswalk, there are trails that head both north 
and south of the road.  Take the gravel trail on the south side, 
heading about 160.  Stay to the right twice, and then look to your 
left for a tranquil view of Corporate America.  Stay by the lake at the 
next intersection and don't feed the waterfowl!  Head uphill past a 
memorial and cross the road.  Find the trail again and go left at the 
triangle.  At the next intersection, go away from the freeway, but almost 
immediately veer right.  At the next conjunction, go left and 
count about 15 paces.  On your right will be two hemlocks.  Check 
the dead stump just right of the northern one.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The return trip?  Just wander a bit!  Its hard to get lost with 
the drone of the freeway's less than melodious song nearby.    
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While searching for a place to hide this box, I found many other good 
places for boxes, so to quote Arnold Schwarzenegger:  
I'll be back!  Or hey, what if some other local boxers want to find 
this one and add to the cache?</div>
