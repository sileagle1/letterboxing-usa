Where is the council you are from?  We are in Virginia Skyline.  <br/>
I hooked my girls on letterboxing when I placed 5 boxes in the park <br/>
where we had our end of season picnic/recognitions for our troop.  <br/>
This kept them busy while the adults set up the picnic.  I sent them <br/>
out two at a time each group starting at a different box and then <br/>
going to the next in line number-wise until they found them all and <br/>
came back to the picnic shelter.  They were all placed so one group <br/>
wouldn't see where the others were going easily.  They were all <br/>
within a short distance from the picnic shelter so we could keep <br/>
track of them.  This hooked a few of the girls when I told them there <br/>
were some in nearby cities.  So that summer we took two trips to find <br/>
letterboxes.  We had some we found and some we never found.<br/>
For a camp-in our troop set up a letterboxing trail around the camp.  <br/>
This was only for the weekend and we picked it up at the end of the <br/>
weekend.   It was successful.  <br/>
The next time we set up a trail was at a Cadette/Senior Council Wide <br/>
weekend.  The camp was quite a distance from our town and we had to <br/>
go once to scout out where to lay the trail and clues.  The weekend <br/>
before the camp we went to set out the boxes figuring we wouldn't get <br/>
there until late on Friday.  Then picked them up on Sunday before we <br/>
left.  It wasn't as successful as the ones in charge didn't get out <br/>
our instructions, just the clues and the other troops were not <br/>
informed as to what the whole thing was about.<br/>
One of our girls is planning to do this as a Gold Project in the <br/>
community. We'll see.<br/>
This has gotten quite long.  If I can be of more detailed help mail <br/>
me off-list.<br/>
Good-Luck,<br/>
