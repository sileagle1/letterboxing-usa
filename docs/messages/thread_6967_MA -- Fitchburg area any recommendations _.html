<br/>
I am going to Fitchburg, MA on Saturday and I would like to do some <br/>
letterboxes while I am up there.  I am not familiar with the area at <br/>
all.  Can anyone recommend some letterbox hikes for me in that area?  <br/>
I will have my dog with me so they must be dog-friendly.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

I have planted 6 letterboxes in Leominster, which is the next town over from <br/>
Fitchburg.  I am sorry I will not be in town this weekend as I would have <br/>
loved to be your guide to our area. 2 of the boxes are extremely easy to find <br/>
(Native Son Bernard Doyle, basically a drive-up and Native Son Lou Little just <br/>
a short hike around a pond)the other four are longer hikes, each about an hour <br/>
to an hour and a half).  I hope you enjoy your visit.  We met at the gathering <br/>
at Sleeping Giant, my stamp is the 3 Wise Men.<br/>

<br/>
yes I remember meeting at the Gathering.  I saw your Native Son boxes <br/>
on line when I looked in the Fitchburg area.  I will definately try <br/>
to hit some of them on Saturday.  Thanks for the reply.  It is <br/>
sometimes hard to tell how long a hike is just from the description.  <br/>
It is always better to hear from someone who has done it.<br/>
<br/>
I will let you know how I make out.<br/>
