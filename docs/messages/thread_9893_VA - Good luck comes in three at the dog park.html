Thank you to Daughter of the Old Dominion for giving us a reason to try the <br/>
dog park again.  We had a very happy and luck morning!<br/>
<br/>
First:  We are very happy to announce that pup DID NOT spend all morning on <br/>
her back in the mud being humped by all the other dogs in the dog park (this <br/>
time).  There were fewer dogs and they were all very friendly (but not too <br/>
friendly).  She had a wonderful time frolicking with two little doggies and <br/>
trying to win the interest of one really huge doggie.  One of the dogs was <br/>
this adorable Jack Russel Terrier who is the best soccer player I have ever <br/>
seen (Ma was studying his style for use on next year's team).  The little <br/>
dog would roll the ball very quickly all over the park, successfully <br/>
avoiding trees and other obstacles.  Every once in a while he would throw <br/>
the ball up in the air and spin it on his nose like a canine Meadowlark <br/>
Lemon!  I told the mom that she should video tape him for the Discovery <br/>
Channel funny animals show.  he was a riot!!  The whole BeMa team came away <br/>
from the park very, very muddy but with a big smile!<br/>
<br/>
Second good luck:  While kind of obviously rooting around in the bushes and <br/>
trying to untangle the dog from a stand of trees -- we met two other Boxer <br/>
teams for our first exchanges!!  Thanks to the Knights of Columbo and <br/>
Witchiepoo who kindly informed us we were focusing on the wrong sewer (it's <br/>
that tricky knowing your right from your left again!)!  We normally really <br/>
hide from other people due to some misplaced sense of weirdoness or <br/>
embarrassment, but, this time we didn't and I'm really glad we met them!  <br/>
It's a lot of fun to put faces with the emails and the boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Third:  Having made our way to the correct sewer -- (now we know how to look <br/>
in the direction of Fairfax) -- we actually found the box!  Very cute stamp. <br/>
  Rusty must have been adorable!  We are also sorry for your loss!  We lost <br/>
our two old pets this past year to old age.  That is hard enough.  I imagine <br/>
anyone losing someone or something before its time is even more devastating. <br/>
  We will have to look for MK next.  I may be over sentimental, but, I think <br/>
this kind of honoring or remembering is very sweet!<br/>
<br/>
We hope everyone is enjoying this beautiful day!  Who knows, after Da wakes <br/>
up from his nap, we may just head out again!!  BeMa<br/>
                                                    P3 F27 X2 (whoohoo!)<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Is Witchiepoo the character from H&amp;R Puffenstuff?  I have this odd way <br/>
back of the head memory of that show...<br/>

Yes! I chose Witchiepoo from the HR Pufnstuf TV show of ages ago. In <br/>
fact, if you go to my website: <br/>
http://wildwinds.tripod.com/witchiepoo.html, you can see her lovely <br/>
picture at the top. :)<br/>
<br/>
I saw the soccer dog as we first came in, and I thought he was <br/>
amazing, too! :) But then again, I'm a sucker for all dogs...<br/>
