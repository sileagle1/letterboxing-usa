                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you to everyone who responded to my special birthday gift.  I will<br/>
begin putting the postcards together tonight and will mail them within the<br/>
next couple of days.  Specific directions will be included and I will send<br/>
a friendly reminder in January.<br/>
<br/>
an elated and eternally grateful,<br/>

<br/>
PS - I did not put your mailing addresses in my yahoo address book.  I<br/>
created an Excel SS to make labels much easier - and to keep up with the<br/>
flurry of response.  After January 18th I will delete all the email<br/>
addresses from my yahoo address book and delete the spreadsheet.  Privacy<br/>
is important to me and I want to respect yours as well.<br/>
