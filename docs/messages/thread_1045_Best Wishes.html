                    <div class="plaintext-content">I truely appreciate Tom Cooch taking time to post about the behind the<br/>
scenes deliberations concerning which way to go with the LBNA site move.<br/>
I also appreciate the considerable support that I received on the list<br/>
regarding my offer to host the site. However, given that there are<br/>
apparently viable alternatives to me hosting the site on my server, I am<br/>
withdrawing the offer. <br/>
<br/>
The fact that it apparently has been necessary to engage in behind the<br/>
scenes debate about whether to  publicly go over "bringing up past<br/>
disagreements with Eric" leaves me to believe that there is at least one<br/>
person (or perhaps more) involved with the future LBNA development with<br/>
whom I would continue to have difficulty working. I attempted to address<br/>
this issue by posting the core issues about which there have been prior<br/>
disagreements, as well as clearly (again) stating my position on the<br/>
future of my ILC site. I tried to address this in as low key a way as<br/>
possible with my posting about why there may be some hesitation about my<br/>
offer. I have NO intention of getting into a rehash of old issues again<br/>
on the list. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone else really cares (which I rather doubt), I have a complete<br/>
archive of the letterboxing-talk list from the first posting by Dan on 5-<br/>
1-98 to the present time. It includes all the  debate about<br/>
"disagreements" in the past. I have been very open about my opinions and<br/>
have nothing to hide. I will provide the url to access the archive if<br/>
anyone is interested. However, I am done with it. <br/>
<br/>
I am still intending to launch an online letterboxing catalog on my ILC<br/>
site where people can post clues by email and they will be available for<br/>
searching on the web the same day. I also will still offer it to be<br/>
accessible from the LBNA site (and others) if people wish to do so. <br/>
However, I am only going to proceed with it if there is sufficient<br/>
interest. Yesterday I posted a note to the letterboxing-talk list with an<br/>
address where people could send clues if they wanted to help be with the<br/>
final testing. I was going to wait a little longer before making the<br/>
posting address public on this list. However, because I am unsure of<br/>
whether there is going to be sufficient interest for me to proceed, I<br/>
decided to go ahead and post it now. If you are interested in trying it<br/>
out, you can send any clues to clues@letterboxing.com . If you have any<br/>
questions about the details, and are not on the letterboxing-talk list,<br/>
please contact me directly and I will answer your questions. Assuming I<br/>
get sufficient interest to proceed, I will publish the web page where you<br/>
can try out seaching the database within the next week. If I don't get<br/>
sufficient interest to proceed, then I am pretty much done with that as<br/>
well. I enjoy the technical aspects of creating letterboxing web<br/>
resources, but I have way too much  work on some other sites that needs<br/>
to be done to waste time on things that are not of interest to others. <br/>
<br/>
I wish the best for the LBNA site wherever it may move.  Regardless of<br/>
whether I continue with the ILC site development, I'll likely  continue<br/>
some involvement with letterboxing. Thanks again for the kind comments by<br/>
numerous people on the list. I really appreciate it!<br/>

It is unfortunate you came to these conclusions.  "Behind the scenes debate" has been going on since well before your offer, and has thankfully NOT centered around "whether to  publicly go over "bringing up past disagreements with Eric". FWIW.<br/>

shame he withdrew it so abruptly.  I feel confident that you and the other<br/>
webmasters are thinking carefully about where we place the LBNA site, so<br/>
that its continued existence and growth cannot be adversely affected by the<br/>
decisions or actions of only one person.  From the very beginning (a few<br/>
years ago now!), it's been obvious that you all have the best interests of<br/>
LBNA at heart. SO--a big thanks!  Many happy letterboxers could not have<br/>
found boxes and had a great time without your efforts.<br/>
