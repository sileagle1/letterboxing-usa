Here in South Texas, Hobby Lobby has been my only source for <br/>
MasterCarve. I have not been able to find the 'thinner' MasterCarve <br/>
for quite a few months now. In fact, I am lucky to be able to find <br/>
even the very thick kind. <br/>
<br/>
I didn't think I could cut it in half very well, and not wanting <br/>
to 'waste' such a thick chunk of it on one stamp, I started making <br/>
multi part stamps. For instance I will carve maybe a tree on one <br/>
side of the stamp, a person on the back side of it, and maybe a <br/>
small bird on one edge and the name of the letterbox on the other <br/>
edge. Stamped all together they make a scene. ...Just an alternative <br/>
idea...<br/>
