this "letterboxing" by chance and never have heard about it before.  <br/>
I'm from Seattle, WA, USA and am a single Mom with three teenager <br/>
boys (12,13,15).  I've been taking them on road trips (an unwritten <br/>
goal of mine is to take them to as many National Parks as possible <br/>
before they all leave home).  We're also involved with Boy Scouting <br/>
and love to hike and backpack and camp and all that fun stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
This sounds so cool to me because I think it would add another <br/>
dimension to our outings.  And I think will keep my boys interested <br/>
even more!  Well, okay, me too!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Where can I go to learn more about it?  And where to "hunt" for these <br/>
hidden treasures?  I don't suppose there would be any in North Idaho-<br/>
Northwestern Montana, would there?  I'm taking a short week camping <br/>
trip there this summer!  ;)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">there are indeed boxes in N. ID and MT.  Just look on the LBNA webpage<br/>
(www.letterboxing.org), go to the clues then click on the states on the map.<br/>
Depending on where you are in ID, you may want to check the Central Idaho<br/>
section as well as Northern.  There are some boxes in the north/central ID,<br/>
Salmon River area.<br/>

If you click on FAQS on our home page you will probably find sufficient info to get started. To locate letterboxes in various areas, other states, etc. click on the book, then click on where ever you wish to go. Please jump in with both feet! In case you found the chat list and not our home page go to--- www.letterboxing.org/.  The National Parks are basically off limits for any published clues . Don    <br/>
