I know that new things on my computer are sometimes an improvement so<br/>
I try to reserve judgement at first. (while gritting my teeth<br/>
usually.) And sometimes once I get used to it I am happier. But I<br/>
don't seem to be getting over this. I still hate it. I don't like the<br/>
way only 5 of my groups are listed on my list. I don't like how I feel<br/>
like Alice in Wonderland where everything is backwards. First is<br/>
really last, previous is really next etc. I am still not used to the<br/>
teeny tiny font as I write this.<br/>
The only redeeming thing I have found now is that you are less likely<br/>
to  accidentally post to the list instead of the author.<br/>
Can we all band together and give Yahoo frequent feedback to at least<br/>
let us have the old version available?<br/>

Yeh, what is the problem with that first/last/previous/next stuff <br/>
anyway?  It is completely backward -- must have a left-handed dyslexic <br/>
doing their programming (now don't flame me on that -- it is meant <br/>
sarcastically, I have nothing against left-hand people or dyslexics).<br/>
<br/>
I also don't like the way when I am typing a message, the last few <br/>
letters of a line disappear off the edge of the editing window until I <br/>
do a hard return.<br/>
<br/>
I sent several feedback messages both about the list appearance and <br/>
the administrative features.  I am certainly not against change, but <br/>
this does seem like a change for the worse.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody mentioned e-mail and I do have some of the regional LB groups <br/>
on e-mail, but there are just too many messages coming from this list -<br/>
- even to direct them into their own folder in my inbox, it would just <br/>
be a lot of clutter.  Also it is much harder to follow a thread up the <br/>
line using e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
On the positive side..  I do like the "clean" look it has by using a <br/>
leaner, non-serif type face for the sidebar and adding more white <br/>
space.  Just don't like the additional advertising on the home pages <br/>
and the extra fluff you get in the message list and on the My Groups <br/>
page.  Now if they really wanted to add something useful to the My <br/>
Groups page, they could take away the picture and add "last message" <br/>
time.<br/>

I sent in my $0.02 to Yahoo as well -<br/>
<br/>
1.  Put the message numbers back next to the messages!<br/>
2.  All we need is the headers, please.<br/>
3.  Put it back into "order" again.<br/>
<br/>
Thankyouverymuch.<br/>
