This is a special opportunity for letterboxers to<br/>
receive two original stamp images by mail in the form<br/>
of holiday postmarks. <br/>
<br/>
I have carved and donated two unique stamps to two<br/>
Georgia post offices for use in Holiday Postmark<br/>
Re-mailing Programs. Details on how to get the<br/>
postmarks and how to count them as Letterbox<br/>
F-counts are here described. <br/>
<br/>
The cities are Dublin, GA all set for St Patricks Day<br/>
re-mailing, and Lovejoy, GA (a little late) but ready<br/>
with their St. Valentines Day postmark.<br/>
