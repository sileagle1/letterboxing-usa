Help find the missing rings!  The bride and groom are<br/>
to be married this evening at Stanley Park in<br/>
Westfield, Massachusetts.  However, the ring bearer,<br/>
an adorable little boy named Jeffrey, lost the rings<br/>
during the rehearsal yesterday.  Apparently, Jeffrey<br/>
doesn't know where they are, but thinks they must have<br/>
fallen out of his pocket somewhere during his<br/>
wanderings.  Here's what Jeffrey had to say when asked<br/>
where the rings might be:<br/>
<br/>
"I had fun at first, when we drove in the main<br/>
entrance and drove down the gravel path that went<br/>
across the field, where we parked.  And it was okay<br/>
when we walked down the stone pathway towards the<br/>
fountain, but then everyone stopped where the paths<br/>
crossed and started talking.  I was getting bored<br/>
while everyone was just standing around talking, so I<br/>
snuck away to find something fun to do.<br/>
<br/>
First, I went towards the big bell tower and played on<br/>
the big map, but I don't think the rings are there.<br/>
<br/>
Then I went back towards the fountain and found the<br/>
dinosour tracks just to the right.  The rings could be<br/>
there, but I'm not sure....<br/>
<br/>
So I continued along the stone path a few steps and<br/>
turned right, and followed the flowers to the end. <br/>
They smelled so pretty!<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the flowers, I went a little to the left<br/>
and down the big stairs towards the pond.  About<br/>
halfway down the stairs, there's a big pine tree on<br/>
the left with a neat hole in its roots.  The rings<br/>
might be there....<br/>
<br/>
At the bottom of the stairs, I went right, along the<br/>
pond, to the covered bridge.  I had fun climbing<br/>
around along the right-hand side of the inside of the<br/>
bridge, but then some geese came and chased me out, so<br/>
you might wanna check there for the rings....<br/>
<br/>
Then I went right and checked out that cool old water<br/>
mill with the big spinning wheel, but I don't think<br/>
the rings are there.  Umm... let me think...  Oh yeah.<br/>
 From there, I didn't go back over the bridge, but<br/>
instead went straight along the pond.  At the top of<br/>
the stairs along the pond, there is a bench with a<br/>
little triple-trunk tree behind it.   Maybe the rings<br/>
are there...<br/>
<br/>
I continued on down the path and came to a little pond<br/>
with a stone bridge, where I found some big frogs! <br/>
