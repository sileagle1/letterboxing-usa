                    <div class="plaintext-content">Eric, you're ("they're?") right that letterboxers purposfully leave a <br/>
trace. I think we've got a pretty clear statement on the subject <br/>
at...well now that I surf around I can't find it... I thought it <br/>
might be under the "join" button or on Randy's faq. Webmasters, <br/>
shouldn't that be right up front somewhere?<br/>
<br/>
We've also been called to task in the past for bushwacking off trail. <br/>
Some areas are more sensitive to that than others (the alpine heights <br/>
in the White Mountains in NH come to mind, I'm sure you can think of <br/>
others).<br/>
<br/>
The folks I've met letterboxing (both on and off line) all share a <br/>
glory in the outdoors and have a fine respect for conservation and <br/>
the ideals of limiting our impact. I don't think our small treasures, <br/>
carefully placed, and searched for by enthusiastic conservationists <br/>
have a negative impact on the environment.<br/>
<br/>
Jay in tiny congested overdeveloped CT that has more trails than any <br/>
other state except NH.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. It has been thought that Letterboxing does not comply with the <br/>
Leave No Trace ethic of outdoorsmanship. We leave plastic with stuff <br/>
in it outside buried or stuck somewhere thereby leaving behind some <br/>
evidence that man has been there.(how do you all fee about this?)&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
And not to rant and rave, but who are the exclusionary homophobic <br/>
cubscouts to preach anyway?<br/>

<div>The bushwhacking also comes to 
mind in the Frederisksburg and VA because several boxes have been placed on 
battlefields. One has to be very careful not wandering off the trail and 
trampling on the civil war earth works. It makes hiding the box more of a 
challenge, within a step or two of the trail yet well hidden.</div>
