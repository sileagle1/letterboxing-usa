Thank-you for all the positive feedback!  After reading the comments I <br/>
realized a third criteria was needed for an Octopus letterbox, <br/>
Environmental Impact.  Some people thought I was suggesting "turn over <br/>
every rock" to find the letterbox or clue.  An ideal placement would <br/>
have no environmental impact.  The clues would lead you straight to the <br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The new criteria for an Octopus letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
1. The clues refer to an area, not the exact route to the letterbox.  <br/>
Clues (or additional letterboxes) are planted, in the defined area, to <br/>
lead people to the main letterbox.<br/>
2. The area is well defined.<br/>
3. Environmental impact. (none if possible)  Another usual statement <br/>
here would be "Do not leave the trails until a clue tells you where to <br/>
go."<br/>
<br/>
This placement is ideal for small areas.  It can be used in larger <br/>
parks by making the defined area smaller; example, "look for clues on <br/>
the Acorn Trail" or "Look for clues within 75 feet of Round Pond".<br/>
<br/>
Several other comments compared the "Octopus" type LB to Geocaching. I <br/>
don't Geocach, so I am not sure what they are referring to. If they <br/>
meant having a series of clues planted, then - "Good", that is one way <br/>
to do it.  If they meant a random search in a 30 or 40 foot diameter <br/>
circle somewhere, that is not at all what I meant.<br/>
<br/>
I am now planning one set of three Lbs for my first Octopus, with a <br/>
rhyme giving clues. Each of the three, will have clues to help with the <br/>
others. <br/>
<br/>
For a second Octopus LB I am planning the main clue will be: "Go to the <br/>
Indian Grinding Stone".  (Octopus clue, since they may have to search <br/>
the park to find it.)  For people who don't know the park, (or don't <br/>
want to spend a lot of time there) I will post additional clues online <br/>
(here?) and at my other letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
While it is usually much quicker &amp; easier to write clues for the <br/>
Octopus type, it can also require more work.  I searched an entire park <br/>
for twenty foot cliffs, to use as Octopus sites, but there was only one <br/>
such cliff &amp; it had a geocache there already.  Usually the Octopus <br/>
requires less effort. On my first difficult placement, I think the long <br/>
directions took over 4 hours to write, check &amp; recheck.  Octopus clues <br/>
are very easy to write.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
