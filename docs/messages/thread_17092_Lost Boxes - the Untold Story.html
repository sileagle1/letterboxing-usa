The Rock That Ate My Letterboxes<br/>
The Case of the Vanishing Letterboxes<br/>
Cloning Boxes<br/>
The Re-Appearance of the Missing Letterboxes   or<br/>
Never Believe Reports of Missing Boxes<br/>
<br/>
One of the first boxes that I ever planted three years ago was Viking Ships at Sunrise at Pettaquamscutt Rock in South Kingstown, RI.  You have to climb up a very large rock rich with history and a wonderful vista and search under a glacial erratic (a chest high rock) for the box.  I have received several reports over the last few years that the box is missing. <br/>
<br/>
Almost two years ago someone reported it being lost so I decided to check it out.  I glanced under the rock, and didn't see it so I carved VSAS #2 and replaced the box.  Then over last summer I again got a report for someone who had previously found it that box #2 was missing.  I promptly carved a new (and better) stamp and proceeded to not replace it.  Box #3 has been sitting in my car for a couple of months waiting to be placed.<br/>
<br/>
Enter Warrior Woman into the story.  After the Mystery Gathering, WW told me that she was buying a house in the area of VSAS and I asked her if she would mind replacing the box for me.  (Not that I have an excuse for not doing it myself as it's less than 1/2 an hour from my house...)  So the day after Thanksgiving she stopped by my house and picked up the new box.  <br/>
<br/>
Enter Mary (RI) and Dan into the story.  On Saturday they were supposed to go hiking with WW who bowed out but asked them to place box #3 under the rock for me.  Mary and Dan proceeded to climb the rock and started to place box #3 when they noticed that box #2 was already there!  Inspired by their find they decided to get a stick and poke under the rock farther when they saw a hint of blue and discovered box #1!!!<br/>
<br/>
They took all three boxes back to Warrior Woman's house to go over their finds.  They ended up putting logbook#3 and stamp #3 into box #1 and returning it to Pettaquamscutt Rock.  Dan put some smaller rocks under the big rock first so that the box can't go so far under this time.  <br/>
<br/>
Since then, however, Dan, Mary and Warrior Woman have been poring over the Hitch Hiker list to see if there are any missing HH's last reported as being dropped off at Viking Ships never to be seen from again.  They have narrowed it down to two (Hitchhiker with a Twist and another one) and are determined to go back with a flashlight and a long stick to see if the rock has consumed any other boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much to Warrior Woman, Mary and Dan for helping me with my boxes and giving me the biggest laugh relating to letterboxing that I have had in a long time.  <br/>
<br/>
So, don't believe all the missing reports you hear (even from the owners!).  Now I just have to claim my refound logs from WW.  (plus if I take off early from work I have a flashlight in the car and some duct tape I can put on the end of a ski pole that's in the back of the car...  Hmmm, which HH's are missing and can I get there before dark?)<br/>

That is so priceless.<br/>
<br/>
I think that is why I seldom say a box is missing--but freely admit that I<br/>
can't find it.  I know myself well enough to admit that I am prone to<br/>
errors.<br/>

That is one of my fears when placing boxes in stone walls and crevices. I'm <br/>
so glad it all came out for the best.<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of CSCM and Warrior Woman's Crossways Crossed Paths box...you <br/>
go to replace a box and lo and behold, there is the original!<br/>

Thanks for the story!<br/>

<br/>
You are most welcome to any help we can provide you and your boxes.  You have provided us with great hikes, new favorite places, and a headache-producing mystery box or two.  Back scratching at its finest.  <s><br/>
<br/>
So tell us, what are ya going to do with numbers one and two? Make 'em hitchhikers and hope that if they disappear, they have the karma to resurface again?<br/>
<br/>
And yes, your VSAS stamps are great, the newer always outshining the previous.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone finds a hiker under that rock, please post.  <br/>

Argh!  This is what I get for not reading all the previous posts <br/>

I'll drop them off to you either sometime in December, but definitely <br/>
during Christmas School vacation when we'll be at the house for the <br/>
week.<br/>
