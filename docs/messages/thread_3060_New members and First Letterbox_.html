                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!  We're the Lac Family--LL,Rosewood,Yin yang and Butterfly.  We <br/>
found our first letterbox as a family today here in ST. Louis, MO.  <br/>
The first one we looked for was missing (Turtle Park Letterbox).  We <br/>
moved on to a second letterbox that was actually close by to Turtle <br/>
Park and found it--it was exciting.<br/>
     We were introduced to letterboxing by Ladybug in VA--she <br/>
actually took Yin yang and butterfly for their first letterbox and <br/>
stamp.  I think letterboxing is a great family activity, it combines <br/>
several interesting things.  <br/>
     LL is active duty Army and of course we move alot.  Letterboxing <br/>
helps you learn about the area where you live and encourages you to <br/>
get out and see it.  We are due to move to Colorado Springs, CO in <br/>
Nov or Dec 01.  Before we move we plan to find the other letterbox in <br/>
ST. Louis and a few in Illinois.  Also, we want to plant at least one <br/>
in each of these states.  We are going to plant our first letterbox <br/>
tommorrow here in South ST.Louis County.<br/>

Great Job guys!  That's so exciting.  Have fun and I'll look forward <br/>
to some great hikes and letterboxing with you all when we visit you <br/>
in Colorado.  Miss you all.  Papa, Riana, Katy and Maggie send love.<br/>
