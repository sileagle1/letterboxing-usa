   I posted once about a letterboxer's journal that I found in Loudoun<br/>
County, but I figured I'd post again just in case the first post got<br/>
lost in the mass. :) I found a stamp journal in Northern Virginia with<br/>
the name "Savannah" on it. Does anyone know this letterboxer? I would<br/>
really like to get the journal back to its owner! (From following the<br/>
trail of stamps from boxes this person has been to, it looks like a<br/>

<br/>
   That's the first thing I did with MY journal after I found this<br/>
one! I put my contact info in some empty space on the very first page.<br/>
I included my e-mail, because I know I'll have the same e-mail (I've<br/>
had this account since 1997) and it might be more stable than even a<br/>
phone number!<br/>
