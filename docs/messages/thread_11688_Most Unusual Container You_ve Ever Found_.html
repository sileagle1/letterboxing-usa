&gt; container you've ever stamped into besides a Rubbermaid Sandwich<br/>

<br/>
Oooh! Oooh!  *raising hand*<br/>
<br/>
The 'container' is actually an altered book!  I stumbled upon this <br/>
idea while leafing through a book called "Altered Books 101" at a <br/>
stamp store and the idea hit me like a brick.  Cutting a cavity into <br/>
a book and hiding the logbook and stamp in it, hidden in plain view <br/>
in a bookstore!  <br/>
<br/>
So I went out, bought an appropriately boring book that hopefully not <br/>
many customers will actually look in (the box still needs to stay <br/>
hidden!).  Sewed the pages together, glued the back over into place, <br/>
and cut out a cavity large enough for a logbook and stamp.  To make <br/>
sure the cover doesn't accidentally open if it was being moved around <br/>
from one shelf to another or whatever reason, I cut out room for <br/>
magnets in the pages and washers in the cover which I then glued in <br/>
place.  Then pasted paper over them so you can't see them.  Looks <br/>
very nice.  The paper explains what letterboxing is and to be <br/>
discreet, since the employees there may not know about it!<br/>
<br/>
Then I smuggled the book into the bookstore and planted on the <br/>
appropriate shelf.  =)  Kind of the opposite of shoplifting, I <br/>
suppose.  I'm sneaking books INTO a bookstore.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, that's the coolest container I've ever used!  It's hidden in <br/>
plain view!  Best job of camaflage (sp?) I've ever seen!  =)  One of <br/>
my proudest moments....<br/>

Well, shoot, man--that's what I've got on my desk right now, waiting to be <br/>
delivered to a bookstore here in Portland, OR.  My book is not NEARLY as <br/>
fancy/clever as yours, tho.  I won't be sneaking it in tho--I know the <br/>
bookstore owner and got her permission to do this before I even began carving <br/>
the stamp.  I've been planning this book-box for many weeks but was <br/>
interrupted by regular life--but it's ready to go &amp; I'll be dropping it ASAP. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And here I thought I was so darn clever, and I'd be the first to do this.... <br/>

for certain microboxes I have been using these little boxes that you use to hide a spare key on your car.  THey are about 3" long, 1" wide and less than 1/2" deep.  They have magnets on the back so they will stick to things.  I have a bunch made that I have to place.  They're not perfectly waterproof though, so you have to think hard about where to place them.  To wrap the things up inside, I wrap them tightly in plastic and fold it over a few times, sometimes with a rubber band, because the zipper part of a sandwich bag is too thick to fit in the box folded.  <br/>

<br/>
Well, I don't want to ruin the joys of figuring out the clues, so <br/>
I'll just say that yes, the book is still there.  And because it's <br/>
fairly new, it hasn't gotten many logs yet.  As for the new or used <br/>
bookstore--you'll just have to come out to California and figure out <br/>
the clue yourself.  =)<br/>

<br/>
I've used film canisters with magnets attached to get that same <br/>
effect, but they seem to be pretty waterproof as well.  I've hidden a <br/>
couple of those cannisters outside without any bags to protect it or <br/>
the contents from the elements, and they've been staying dry just <br/>
fine.  It might depend on the film canister you use, though, since <br/>
they aren't all created equal.<br/>
