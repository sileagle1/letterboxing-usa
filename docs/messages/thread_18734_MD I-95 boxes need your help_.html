<br/>
Last year we planted two boxes at the Maryland I-95 reststops: Gas-N-Go at <br/>
Cheapeake House and Pit Stop at Maryland House. Since then, we've moved <br/>
to CA so need to do a bit of long-distance maintenence...<br/>
<br/>
I got a report that Gas-n-Go is missing. If that's true, I'd love to mail out a new <br/>
one to someone to replant.<br/>
<br/>
Pit Stop has a full log. It's a film canister microbox that had a scroll wrapped <br/>
around a pencil. If someone could replace the scroll, that would be great. If <br/>
you send us the old one, we'll even send a little reward your way!<br/>
<br/>
If you can help, please let us know by emailing us at <br/>

these microboxes (May 7 - MD House &amp; May 14 - Chesapeake House).  SO <br/>
GAS-N-GO was there at 12:30 this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is going to the May 22 gather in Ellicott City - maybe <br/>
they can post their intention to fix them -- with new paper scrolls <br/>
(1-1/2" wide stripes of 11" lenth, about 12 strips I think.  Staple <br/>
to a pencil stub -- or just together and roll up to fit in film <br/>
canister.)<br/>
