Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
My new company, Eons, has just launched a contest where we are giving<br/>
away $15,000but there is a twist.<br/>
<br/>
The contest is limited to only people aged 50 and over. If you're over<br/>
50, great, if not, please do me a huge favor and forward this on to<br/>
everyone you know over the age of 50.  Here's how our contest works:<br/>
<br/>
   1. Go to www.eons.com and enter in prize code 80412. This will get<br/>
you into the site<br/>
   2. Enter in four or more of your goalsthe things you want to<br/>
accomplish between now and when you turn 100 , as well as your email<br/>
address so we can notify you if you win.<br/>
   3. Forward this invitation to everyone else you know who is over<br/>
the age of 50.<br/>
<br/>
Entering the list is a pretty cool self-learning task in and of<br/>
itself, but once you enter your list, on an ongoing basis you'll be<br/>
able to come back to Eons to edit your list of goals, gather<br/>
customized information that will help you achieve your goals, connect<br/>
with others who have the same goals or who have already completed the<br/>
goal, and access special deals to help you go out and actually<br/>
accomplish your goals. We're very excited about this!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're having a contest internally to see who can get the most people<br/>
to enter their list, so thank you very much for your assistance in<br/>
forwarding this emal on. And if this was forwarded to you, please feel<br/>
free to re-forward this!<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>

&gt; Greetings,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My new company, Eons, has just launched a contest where we are <br/>
giving<br/>
&gt; away $15,000but there is a twist.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The contest is limited to only people aged 50 and over. If you're <br/>
over<br/>
&gt; 50, great, if not, please do me a huge favor and forward this on to<br/>
&gt; everyone you know over the age of 50.  Here's how our contest works:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    1. Go to www.eons.com and enter in prize code 80412. This will <br/>
get<br/>
&gt; you into the site<br/>
&gt;    2. Enter in four or more of your goalsthe things you want to<br/>
&gt; accomplish between now and when you turn 100 , as well as your email<br/>
&gt; address so we can notify you if you win.<br/>
&gt;    3. Forward this invitation to everyone else you know who is over<br/>
&gt; the age of 50.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Entering the list is a pretty cool self-learning task in and of<br/>
&gt; itself, but once you enter your list, on an ongoing basis you'll be<br/>
&gt; able to come back to Eons to edit your list of goals, gather<br/>
&gt; customized information that will help you achieve your goals, <br/>
connect<br/>
&gt; with others who have the same goals or who have already completed <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; goal, and access special deals to help you go out and actually<br/>
&gt; accomplish your goals. We're very excited about this!<br/>
&gt;                                                                     <br/>
<br/>
&gt;                                                                     <br/>
<br/>
&gt;              <br/>
&gt; We're having a contest internally to see who can get the most people<br/>
&gt; to enter their list, so thank you very much for your assistance in<br/>
&gt; forwarding this emal on. And if this was forwarded to you, please <br/>
feel<br/>
&gt; free to re-forward this!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best Wishes,<br/>
