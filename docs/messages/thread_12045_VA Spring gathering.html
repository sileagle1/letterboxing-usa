thing about it lately and I'm very, very sorry and wish to most earnestly beg <br/>
all your pardon, but I want to announce that the PA/DE/MD/DC/VA/WV/NC/SC and <br/>
anyone else who wants to come spring 'boxing gathering will be at Riverbend <br/>
Park in Fairfax Co. VA (www.co.fairfax.va.us/parks/nature.htm) on Saturday, <br/>
May 31, exact location in the park to be announced.  We will start very <br/>
informally at 10:00 a.m. and go until everyone is ready to be done or the <br/>
park closes, whichever comes first.  'Boxers of all ages and species welcome!<br/>
<br/>
Persons willing and able to do boxes for this gathering, an event stamp and <br/>
anyone willing to speak on a related subject or show others how to do <br/>
something are urgently solicited.  This event is potluck, so if you can bring <br/>
something please let me know and anyone RSVP ASAP.<br/>

I'll add a new box to the park and will be sure to post the clues <br/>
before the 31st so everyone can print them off before they come.  I'm <br/>
going to decline on trying to make the event stamp but I'm sure <br/>
someone will volunteer to carve one.  I don't think I have any topic <br/>
or subject to teach others.  <br/>
<br/>
For potluck - can we just bring anything or are you trying to plan a <br/>
menu?  Usually if enough people come, there is variety and you don't <br/>
have to worry that everyone will bring brownies.  I promise not to <br/>
bring brownies (although my brownies are very good).<br/>

&gt; Do you want people to carve stamps and hide them before hand or do we use <br/>
&gt; the stamps for something else?  I know it sounds like a very dumb question, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; but we have missed all the previous gathers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I think everyone can handle this as they please - hide and post clues on the <br/>
website in advance, hide and hand out clues at gathering, carve and bring <br/>
personal travelers, whatever!  Experienced gatherers (as I am not), please <br/>
enlighten us with how you have done this at past events!<br/>

Yay, Bema!  It will be great to meet you all!  Yes, trailer trash macaroni <br/>
salad sounds awesome and I'm sure many people will want it.  That name gives <br/>
me a particular mental image picture of the salad and we'll see if it's the <br/>
same.  I hope the Happy Homeschoolers will also come and lots of people with <br/>
kids.  I've met a few other boxers only in person and none with children and <br/>
I'm eager to meet some other families and compare fun-creating ideas for us <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what you put in your salad but if it has mayo, I wanted to give <br/>
you an idea: last summer I went to a barbecue with some southern potato salad <br/>
I made which included mayonnaise in the recipe and people got sick as it was <br/>
sitting out on the picnic table for hours so I now use Nayonnaise, which is a <br/>
soy-based "mayo" and doesn't include the raw egg.  I love potato salad and <br/>
macaroni salad and that seemed to make it safer for outdoor gatherings, which <br/>
to my mind must include potato and macaroni salad.<br/>

We would love to come! Count us in for some kind of food--after <br/>
enough food and chocolate today to feed a small army (do 12 <br/>
adults and 7 kids constitute a small army?), I can't even think <br/>
about what type, but will figure out something closer to the <br/>
