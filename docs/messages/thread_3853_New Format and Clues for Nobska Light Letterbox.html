<p><span>Park in the small Lighthouse Viewing 
Only parking lot on the side of the road in front of the lighthouse. There is 
room for about five cars here with one hour parking. (I imagine this is strictly 
enforced in the summer). Make your way up to the plaque fixed to the tower. From 
this point turn around 180 <sup>o</sup>, looking out over the sound towards 
Woods Hole. From here, due West, across the road you will see a small bluff. At 
the edge of this bluff you will find a Defense Mapping Agency Survey Marker. (a 
small round brass disc embedded in concrete) From this point, take the path in 
front of you down to the rocks. Seek out and find the National Ocean Service 
Benchmark. From this spot take ten paces forward and twelve paces left. Look for 
MOM at this point. The Nobska Light Letterbox is hidden beneath a large salmon 
colored rock to your left as you face MOM. The box was placed in early March, 
when all the stickers and other vegetation were dormant. Keep this in mind if 
you seek the box in warmer days. <span>[I later found out all 
of those vines were POISON IVY. BEWARE!!!!] </span><span>{New Note. Due to excessive vegetation, this box is 
accessible only in the winter}</span></span></p>

<p><span>Letterboxing, like any outdoor sport, carries the risk of 
unforeseen hazards. Letterboxing North America supports a policy of not 
knowingly placing letterboxes in areas that will create undue risk to the 
letterbox hunter.  However, as conditions may vary, it is the 
responsibility of the letterbox searcher to become thoroughly familiar with the 
conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately prepare for those 
conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly with respect to those 
conditions and with respect to his or her personal abilities and 
limitations.  "Letterboxing North America" and the individual letterbox 
sponsors assume no liability for events, which may occur, related directly or 
indirectly to one's searching for a 
letterbox. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Do not 
let children hunt for letterboxes 
unsupervised. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
