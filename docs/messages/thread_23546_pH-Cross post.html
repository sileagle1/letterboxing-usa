Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone has heard from pH, or knows how to get in <br/>
touch with him.<br/>
All his boxes are up for adoption on Atlasquest as he hasn't posted in a <br/>
year.<br/>
There is one particular box, Vinland Ship, that I would be interested in <br/>
adopting. One of the compass points is missing a number, which means <br/>
that it is very hard to find.<br/>
(I found it accidentally on my way out) I would like to repost the <br/>
correct clues, but  I don't want to swipe anyone's box who is just <br/>
taking a breather.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

I think that the boxes on AQ are put up for adoption if the user hasn't <br/>
logged in in a year. Just like you say, though, I am hesitant to adopt a <br/>
box without speaking to the person whose box it is, or at least <br/>
ascertaining that they are no longer interested in the box in the way <br/>
that is normally done. (I don't know how that would be actually, but <br/>
presumably since adoptions occur there must be some method)<br/>
I don't know exactly what Arcane Mandala is supposed to mean, but at <br/>
least one person commented about the compass bearings being one number <br/>
short. Another mysterious boxer (Camera Obscura) commented that pH <br/>
needed to get a new compass!<br/>
Anyway, I thought I would inquire to find out if anyone knows about him.<br/>
I do think it is in the interest of the hobby to maintain the boxes if <br/>
possible. I know that I am disappointed when a box is gone, and it's not <br/>
noted etc.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&gt; in my own opinion i would rather see the boxes get deleted from<br/>
&gt; atlas quest before i saw them go up for adoption.<br/>
<br/>
I did consider this idea, but finally abandoned it because without<br/>
clues, any boxes still left out there would essentially become trash<br/>
with nobody to look for them or maintain them. If a box has been<br/>
abadoned, someone else can take care of it, retire it, or do what they<br/>
want, but the one thing I don't want to happen to it is to have it<br/>
stay out in the wild and abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I am hesitant to adopt a box without speaking to the person whose<br/>
&gt; box it is, or at least ascertaining that they are no longer<br/>
&gt; interested in the box in the way that is normally done. <br/>
<br/>
I definitely encourage people to try to contact the planter of a<br/>
letterbox that's been abandoned, and Atlas Quest will automatically<br/>
attempt to e-mail the planter to let them know the box will be up for<br/>
adoption a week or so before it officially ends up in the 'orphanage.'<br/>
Unfortunately, it seems that most of the listed e-mail addresses of<br/>
planters of seemingly abandoned boxes no longer work, and thus many<br/>
planters may never find out about their box going up for adoption. If<br/>
you can find additional contact information to let them know about the<br/>
status of their boxes, however, I'd definitely encourage people to do so. <br/>
<br/>
As for how adoptions work on AQ--everyone is expected to maintain<br/>
their boxes and those that are thought to be abandoned will go up for<br/>
adoption. For now, at least, that line is anyone who has not logged<br/>
into the site for at least a year will be considered as having abanded<br/>
their boxes. It's subject to change if it turns out that criteria is<br/>
too long, too short, or not specific enough--but so far it seems to be<br/>
working well and I don't have any intention of changing it anytime soon.<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned before, AQ will attempt to contact the registered owner<br/>
a week or so before the boxes go up for adoption, but historically,<br/>
most such attempts in failure. (It's definitely worth while to make<br/>
sure you keep your e-mail address up-to-date on Atlas Quest!)<br/>
<br/>
As for boxes listed on AQ but the clues are hosted elsewhere--I can't<br/>
do much about the remotely hosted clues. If the clue is hosted on<br/>
LbNA, I suggest that the person try to adopt the listing on LbNA as<br/>
well. Contact an LbNA webmaster to do that, since I don't think<br/>
there's any automated method for adopting boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of that, the only option left is to host your own version of<br/>
the clue--either on AQ or a website of your choice that you can link<br/>
to--and let the old clue wallow in whatever corner of the web it<br/>
stands until whever the old clue is swallowed by time and cobwebs.<br/>
<br/>
If a box is listed on both LbNA and AQ but the clue is hosted on AQ,<br/>
it's not so critical to adopt the version on LbNA. At least the clue<br/>
will stay up to date since you'd be able to access the version on AQ.<br/>
Ideally, though, it would be a good idea to adopt the listing from<br/>
both sites if possible.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, if the original planter of the box does come back and<br/>
wants to reclaim the adopted boxes, they'll be able to do that at any<br/>
time. AQ still saves the original planter and authors of the box<br/>
(which cannot be changed by someone who adopted the boxes), and<br/>
they'll always have the power to transfer ownership of their boxes<br/>
back to themselves at any time.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to make it as fair and simple as possible, but the moral of<br/>
the story is--don't abandon your boxes! If you decide to quit<br/>
letterboxing, find others to take care of your boxes or remove the<br/>
ones you planted completely, but it's really bad taste just to leave<br/>
abandoned boxes and leaves an awkward situation in its wake that<br/>
doesn't have any perfect solutions.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I still don't understand, however, how not checking into your website in a<br/>
year or having changed their email address means that the original owner<br/>
"abandoned" a box.   Do these boxes where the owner hasn't checked into<br/>
atlasquest in a year still have their stamp and logbook?  Is the container<br/>
still in OK condition?<br/>
<br/>
And if a box is on both LbNA and atlasquest, by deleting it from atlasquest,<br/>
how do the boxes become "trash" with "nobody to look for them or maintain<br/>
them"?  They're still on LbNA for boxers to get the clues and do maintenance<br/>
if they wish to.<br/>
<br/>
By suggesting that folks contact the LbNA webmaster to adopt a box that<br/>
you've deemed abandoned on atlasquest, it kinda seems to me as if you want<br/>
to change a tradition and you're hoping to make LbNA change also.<br/>
<br/>
Your last paragraph just doesn't make sense to me.   With your new system,<br/>
you don't know that anybody *is* having the "bad taste" to abandon their<br/>
box(es).  Aren't you deciding that for yourself with no evidence from the<br/>
box itself?<br/>
<br/>
Even if a placer is out of letterboxing, whether permanently or temporarily,<br/>
someone else could be maintaining that placer's boxes.  When Pippi and Keith<br/>
left the U.S. for a few years, they left a couple of other local boxers who<br/>
volunteered in charge of their boxes until I could get supplies together to<br/>
maintain the boxes myself.  So if the two of them had not removed the boxes<br/>
from atlasquest, the boxes would still be listed even tho they hadn't<br/>
checked in to atlasquest and even tho their email addy has changed.  Can't<br/>
get comcast cable where they're staying now. :-)  And the boxes would not<br/>
have been abandoned -- I keep the clues up to date and the boxes well<br/>
maintained.  But you would have decided to call the boxes abandoned.  I just<br/>
guess I'll never figure that's proper.<br/>
<br/>
I could even understand if you set up some sort of "damaged box report"<br/>
where finders could log in to state that they found the box but the stamp<br/>
was missing or the logbook missing or the contents strewn all over the<br/>
place.  And then that finder or other finders checked back in a month or two<br/>
and confirmed that the situation hadn't been corrected, thus the box would<br/>
be going up for maintenance adoption.  In other words, using some sort of<br/>
field observation to suppose that a box has likely really truly been<br/>
abandoned.  That, in my personal opinion, seems a little bit less like<br/>
stealing someone else's property.<br/>
<br/>
I could even see doing the adoption bit with newly listed boxes if the first<br/>
thing it states when a placer goes to list a box on atlasquest *now* is that<br/>
the placer must check in at least once a year or the box will be deemed<br/>
abandoned.  Then at least a person is warned right upfront.   I can't see<br/>
changing the requirements for already listed boxes.<br/>
<br/>
But you're the site owner and as such you surely can do what you want -- no<br/>
matter who agrees or disagrees with your policy, it's your website.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; in my own opinion i would rather see the boxes get deleted from<br/>
&gt; atlas quest before i saw them go up for adoption.<br/>
<br/>
I did consider this idea, but finally abandoned it because without<br/>
clues, any boxes still left out there would essentially become trash<br/>
with nobody to look for them or maintain them. If a box has been<br/>
abadoned, someone else can take care of it, retire it, or do what they<br/>
want, but the one thing I don't want to happen to it is to have it<br/>
stay out in the wild and abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I am hesitant to adopt a box without speaking to the person whose<br/>
&gt; box it is, or at least ascertaining that they are no longer<br/>
&gt; interested in the box in the way that is normally done.<br/>
<br/>
I definitely encourage people to try to contact the planter of a<br/>
letterbox that's been abandoned, and Atlas Quest will automatically<br/>
attempt to e-mail the planter to let them know the box will be up for<br/>
adoption a week or so before it officially ends up in the 'orphanage.'<br/>
Unfortunately, it seems that most of the listed e-mail addresses of<br/>
planters of seemingly abandoned boxes no longer work, and thus many<br/>
planters may never find out about their box going up for adoption. If<br/>
you can find additional contact information to let them know about the<br/>
status of their boxes, however, I'd definitely encourage people to do so.<br/>
<br/>
As for how adoptions work on AQ--everyone is expected to maintain<br/>
their boxes and those that are thought to be abandoned will go up for<br/>
adoption. For now, at least, that line is anyone who has not logged<br/>
into the site for at least a year will be considered as having abanded<br/>
their boxes. It's subject to change if it turns out that criteria is<br/>
too long, too short, or not specific enough--but so far it seems to be<br/>
working well and I don't have any intention of changing it anytime soon.<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned before, AQ will attempt to contact the registered owner<br/>
a week or so before the boxes go up for adoption, but historically,<br/>
most such attempts in failure. (It's definitely worth while to make<br/>
sure you keep your e-mail address up-to-date on Atlas Quest!)<br/>
<br/>
As for boxes listed on AQ but the clues are hosted elsewhere--I can't<br/>
do much about the remotely hosted clues. If the clue is hosted on<br/>
LbNA, I suggest that the person try to adopt the listing on LbNA as<br/>
well. Contact an LbNA webmaster to do that, since I don't think<br/>
there's any automated method for adopting boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of that, the only option left is to host your own version of<br/>
the clue--either on AQ or a website of your choice that you can link<br/>
to--and let the old clue wallow in whatever corner of the web it<br/>
stands until whever the old clue is swallowed by time and cobwebs.<br/>
<br/>
If a box is listed on both LbNA and AQ but the clue is hosted on AQ,<br/>
it's not so critical to adopt the version on LbNA. At least the clue<br/>
will stay up to date since you'd be able to access the version on AQ.<br/>
Ideally, though, it would be a good idea to adopt the listing from<br/>
both sites if possible.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, if the original planter of the box does come back and<br/>
wants to reclaim the adopted boxes, they'll be able to do that at any<br/>
time. AQ still saves the original planter and authors of the box<br/>
(which cannot be changed by someone who adopted the boxes), and<br/>
they'll always have the power to transfer ownership of their boxes<br/>
back to themselves at any time.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to make it as fair and simple as possible, but the moral of<br/>
the story is--don't abandon your boxes! If you decide to quit<br/>
letterboxing, find others to take care of your boxes or remove the<br/>
ones you planted completely, but it's really bad taste just to leave<br/>
abandoned boxes and leaves an awkward situation in its wake that<br/>
doesn't have any perfect solutions.<br/>

&gt; website in a year or having changed their email address means that<br/>
&gt; the original owner "abandoned" a box.<br/>
<br/>
If they are not logging into the site, then they are not reading any<br/>
reports by finders who might report that maintenance is needed or that<br/>
the box may be missing. And I won't sit by and let AQ get clogged with<br/>
lots of old, abandoned boxes planted by people it's no longer possible<br/>
to contact and who no longer letterbox or maintain their boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, logging in at least once a year may not be a perfect<br/>
solution--I'll grant you that--but if you have a better suggestion,<br/>
I'd be willing to listen. How can I determine systematically if a<br/>
letterbox has been abandoned when I cannot contact the person? That's<br/>
the rub.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do these boxes where the owner hasn't checked into<br/>
&gt; atlasquest in a year still have their stamp and logbook?  Is the<br/>
&gt; container still in OK condition?<br/>
<br/>
Does it matter? Some boxes that have been abandoned are in perfectly<br/>
good shape, and others are not. Eventually, they'll all degrade over<br/>
time and if they aren't yet missing a stamp or have a soaked logbook,<br/>
eventually they will without someone around to maintain them.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And if a box is on both LbNA and atlasquest, by deleting it from<br/>
&gt; atlasquest, how do the boxes become "trash" with "nobody to look for<br/>
&gt; them or maintain them"?<br/>
<br/>
Not all boxes on Atlas Quest are also listed on LbNA, and AQ does not<br/>
have a systematic way of determining how often people log into LbNA<br/>
or--even it did it--which accounts on LbNA can be linked to the same<br/>
person on AQ.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; By suggesting that folks contact the LbNA webmaster to adopt a box<br/>
&gt; that you've deemed abandoned on atlasquest, it kinda seems to me as<br/>
&gt; if you want to change a tradition and you're hoping to make LbNA<br/>
&gt; change also.<br/>
<br/>
To be perfectly honest, it's in Atlas Quest's best interest for LbNA<br/>
*not* to remove and purge old, abandoned letterboxes. It clutters the<br/>
results with a lot of missing and damaged letterboxes and if Atlas<br/>
Quest can provide a better set of clues that people can be certain are<br/>
more up-to-date and maintained than LbNA, more people will start using AQ.<br/>
<br/>
If you think trying to get people to take responsibility for their<br/>
letterboxers or give them to someone who will maintain them is a bad<br/>
thing, well, you are entitled to your opinion. And that's okay, I<br/>
don't mind. I can't make everyone happy, so I don't really try.<br/>
Instead, I try to do what I think is right and best for everyone<br/>
involved (which does include people *looking* for boxes as well as the<br/>
people who planted boxes).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Your last paragraph just doesn't make sense to me.   With your new<br/>
&gt; system, you don't know that anybody *is* having the "bad taste" to<br/>
&gt; abandon their box(es).  Aren't you deciding that for yourself with<br/>
&gt; no evidence from the box itself?<br/>
<br/>
There is evidence--they've stopped using the website for an entire<br/>
year and they've stopped maintaining information to contact them or<br/>
ignored warning that their boxes will be put up for adoption. It's<br/>
circumstancial evidence, to be sure, but if it walks like a duck and<br/>
quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Even if a placer is out of letterboxing, whether permanently or<br/>
&gt; temporarily, someone else could be maintaining that placer's boxes. <br/>
<br/>
That's fine--then the planter should transfer ownership of the<br/>
letterbox to the person who is maintaining it. How can someone<br/>
maintain a clue if they can't log in and change it? How can a<br/>
maintainer get reports of damage or problems if they aren't the<br/>
registered owner of the box.<br/>
<br/>
I think you're confusing what exactly an 'owner' of a letterbox means<br/>
on AQ. That's the person who maintains the letterbox and keeps it<br/>
going. If someone plants a letterbox far from home, they'll still be<br/>
listed as the planter and the author--they'll ALWAYS be listed as the<br/>
planter and author and ALWAYS be able to access their boxes regardless<br/>
of how long its been since they last logged in. The "owner" is just<br/>
the day-to-day maintainer of the letterbox. I suppose I could have<br/>
called it a "maintainer" rather than "owner", but "maintainer" is such<br/>
an awkward word. But a maintainer also needs all the same access to<br/>
the box's listing as the person who originally listed it, so they<br/>
essentially become a co-owner of the box. It allows people to maintain<br/>
another person's letterbox without the original owner having to give<br/>
up any rights to their own letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And the boxes would not have been abandoned -- I keep the clues up<br/>
&gt; to date and the boxes well maintained.<br/>
<br/>
How can you keep the clues up to date if you can't access the box listing?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; That, in my personal opinion, seems a little bit less like<br/>
&gt; stealing someone else's property.<br/>
<br/>
And please don't forget--the person who planted the letterbox--they<br/>
will *always* have full access to the clue and the right to take back<br/>
any boxes that have been adopted by someone else. Ultimately, the<br/>
person who planted the letterbox trumps all else on Atlas Quest--even<br/>
after the box has been adopted by someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Most of your complaints, I fear, are more a result of not fully<br/>
understanding how the system works on Atlas Quest rather than <br/>
<br/>
&gt; I could even see doing the adoption bit with newly listed boxes if<br/>
&gt; the first thing it states when a placer goes to list a box on<br/>
&gt; atlasquest *now* is that the placer must check in at least once a<br/>
&gt; year or the box will be deemed abandoned. Then at least a person is<br/>
&gt; warned right upfront.<br/>
<br/>
People are warned upfront--before they're even allowed to create an<br/>
account on Atlas Quest, they must accept the terms of service which<br/>
include:<br/>
<br/>
1. You agree to maintain a valid contact e-mail address, associated<br/>
either with your clues, account, or website where your clues are hosted.<br/>
<br/>
2. You accept that the webmasters may remove or assign your clues to a<br/>
"caretaker"<br/>
<br/>
I don't explicitly state when that might happen since I don't want to<br/>
update the TOS every time there's any tiny modification in the<br/>
criteria, but I make no secret of how it's determined.<br/>
<br/>
And, based on the feedback I've gotten, most people are pretty happy<br/>
with the policy.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But you're the site owner and as such you surely can do what you<br/>
&gt; want -- no matter who agrees or disagrees with your policy, it's<br/>
&gt; your website.<br/>
<br/>
That's true to a certain degree, but it matters very much to me what<br/>
others think about the various features and policies on AQ. There are<br/>
some features I put in then later pulled back out after a lot of<br/>
protest. There are some features where a couple of people might<br/>
protest loudly but most people are supportive of, and I'll leave those<br/>
in place.<br/>
<br/>
I might be the site owner, but the website isn't just for me and I<br/>
know that. There are a lot of features on the site I personally don't<br/>
like, but I put them there for others who do. There are a lot of<br/>
features I'd like to include but don't because most people don't seem<br/>
to want it.<br/>
<br/>
So I don't think it's really fair to suggest that I don't care about<br/>
what others think, because that's not true.<br/>

understand what is meant by adoption on atlas quest, and feeling quite dumb<br/>
i might add. if i had really thought about it i would have understood just<br/>
what the "owner" thing was referring to. <br/>
<br/>
maybe the confusion comes from the term adoption. <br/>
<br/>
the first definition of adoption means "to take by choice into a<br/>
relationship; especially : to take voluntarily (a child of other parents) as<br/>
one's own child".<br/>
<br/>
the first definition of foster means "affording, receiving, or sharing<br/>
nurture or parental care though not related by blood or legal ties".<br/>
<br/>
now what you are describing how atlas quest works in my feeble brain it is a<br/>
foster care system. much different than an adoption. <br/>
<br/>
being involved in adoption and fostering of real children i was confused by<br/>
the whole proccess. ryan's explanation works for me. <br/>
<br/>
lbna works for me, atlas quest works for me, all in all both are great sites<br/>
and i thank both sites for the work that they do and for trying their best<br/>
to prevent abandoned boxes from becoming litter. <br/>
