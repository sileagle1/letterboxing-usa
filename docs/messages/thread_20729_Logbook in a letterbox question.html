Greetings.<br/>
<br/>
I am a new letterboxer in a county with very few letterboxes, but I'm hoping to change that.   <br/>
My quandary is this:  I am about to place my first box this weekend. I bought a special logbook <br/>
and then discovered a really nice carved wooden box in which to place it, but it turns out the <br/>
logbook won't fit.  I was originally going to use a regular plastic container, but because this <br/>
letterbox will be inside, I was inspired to use the wooden box after finding the beautiful boxes <br/>
in the Mansfield General Store last weekend.  The letterbox will be in a safe place and I could <br/>
just put them together.  How essential is it that the logbook be IN the letterbox?  Is this <br/>
totally against the "rules"?  I know, I can just buy another logbook, but I thought I'd get some <br/>
feedback from those of you more experienced with the etiquette.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
<br/>
