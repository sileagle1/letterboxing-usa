Maryland Road Trip<br/>
Planted Nov. 16th, 2001<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Northwestern Maryland, Four miles east of Boonsboro, 1 1/2 miles <br/>
North of alternate RT. 40 on "Monument Road". Look for the brown sign with a <br/>
white arrow painted on it that says "one mile". We missed it the first <br/>
time...<br/>
<br/>
Type: Easy<br/>
<br/>
Terrain: Short uphill hike on a well maintained trail.<br/>
<br/>
"Spirit Walk"<br/>
<br/>
Head towards the "Monument" which includes a wonderful view of the <br/>
Cumberland Valley's migratory bird flyway. The "AT" winds through the park, <br/>
and that is always a plus!<br/>
Take note of the tidbits of info on the way up hill, that "George" was such <br/>
a busy guy!!<br/>
When you have soaked it all in, enjoy more by stamping into Squirrel's <br/>
letterbox "Washington Monument".<br/>
On the way down to the parking lot with the "Monument" behind you, look <br/>
towards "Valley Forge" to the east.<br/>
Behind the "Post" at "Valley Forge" locate your destination east of  the <br/>
"rock" in concrete.<br/>
We were there off season so I do not know how busy this area gets. Take care <br/>
in finding and re-hiding the box!! There is a well made shelter in sight of <br/>
this location where you could sit down spread your<br/>
boxing stuff out and stamp up a storm!!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy Life! 'Box On!!<br/>
