We read what you are saying... but since the people who "inhabit" this list,<br/>
and those attracted to the site and letterboxing in general, all seem to<br/>
have the same mentality (self reliance and responsibility), are you<br/>
suggesting that we are poised to be overrun with armchair namby pambies who<br/>
are ill equipped to navigate their SUV's in mall parking lots, let alone in<br/>
an actual "wilderness?"  Why are you so sure they will want to letterbox in<br/>
the first place?  There is no gratification other than a dorky little stamp<br/>
and sore feet.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think there is liability.... no, I don't think it is so great that we<br/>
need to seriously alter the way we choose to participate.<br/>

I hear what you're saying and finally here's my prediction:  A few of <br/>
you will have their lives destroyed and the rest duck into the <br/>
shadows and will abandon them like wounded comrades on the <br/>
battlefield.  I'm not pushing fear.  I'm talking about responsibility <br/>
and compassion. <br/>
