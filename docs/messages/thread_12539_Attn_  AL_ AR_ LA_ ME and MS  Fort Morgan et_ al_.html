I've finally had the chance to make it to Ft. Morgan and check on the <br/>
letterbox there and I am happy to report that it is alive and well.  <br/>
<br/>
It's a nice fort and I'll be more than happy to adopt it and possibly <br/>
plant some more there.<br/>

Glad you found it.  When I drop off boxes out of town, I tend to make<br/>
the clues rather simple due to the short time I have to plant them.  <br/>
Could you tell me if you were the first visitor?<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing,<br/>
