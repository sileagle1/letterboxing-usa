just though I'd pass along a bit of info...<br/>
<br/>
They have a new web site:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.stampeaz.com/<br/>
<br/>
*** Also, they will be closed from July 10 through August 6, thus no <br/>
orders after July 9, so order up this week ***<br/>
<br/>
They have also gone to PayPal for Credit Card orders, which is no big <br/>
deal if you already have a PayPal account or don't have a problem <br/>
getting one.  If you aren't comfortable with that, they still accept <br/>
check or money order for payment also.<br/>
