cool here in New England.<br/>
<br/>
We had a couple of false starts on Saturday: We set out for the <br/>
Battle Road Trail Lbx in Concord only to find a revolutionary war re-<br/>
enactment taking place that morning with hundreds of people around! <br/>
Then we proceeded to the Great Meadows Refuge to find "Moments to <br/>
Celebrate" only to discover that the whole area around where the box <br/>
is supposed to be is still flooded (we hope the box is OK!). We did <br/>
almost stumble across a goose nest with a couple eggs right next to <br/>
the trail on the "causeway" though.<br/>
<br/>
Things got better from there. After a late lunch, we went back to <br/>
get "Battle Road Trail" (still a bit of pedestrian traffic so we took <br/>
a long "water break" on the side of the trail trying to look <br/>
inconspicuous). Box is in good shape. Then we headed over to <br/>
Estabrook Woods, a gem of land in Concord that we can't wait to <br/>
revisit. We found "Limestone Quarry" (next to a "spooky <br/>
residence"...can you find it?) and "Henry's Sawmill Site", both in <br/>
fine condition.<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, we headed down to the coast area and picked up "Toxic <br/>
Tack", "Sins of the Flesh" series, "Great Blue", and the "Trees" <br/>
series. Box #1 of the "Sins..." series was cracked and had bad water <br/>
damage. We repaired as best we could. I can definitely see why people <br/>
recommend against the Glad containers! The other boxes were fine and <br/>
well. We went to New Bedford in search of "Clark's Point Light" with <br/>
no luck. I think the lighthouse bearings in the clues are reversed <br/>
but even still we had no luck...has anybody found this box recently?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who planted these boxes...we had fun!<br/>
