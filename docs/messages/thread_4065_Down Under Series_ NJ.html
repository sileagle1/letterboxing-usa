<br/>
<br/>Went for a walk in High Mountain Preserve today.  I started from WPU and did the red/yellow/red loop which took me by EMU and DINGO, so I checked in on them  both.  DINGO is just fine ... well hidden, warm and dry.  EMU, on the other hand, was a little damp.  I dried out the box and baggies as best I could and put everything back, but thought you should know that the notebook is pretty damp.
<br/>
<br/>Great day to be up top of High Mountain ...  I could see from bridge to bridge to bridge.  It sure gave me a rush and a lump in my throat to see the flag that's been recently planted waving high above as I approached the summit.

Thanks for the information.  I had planned to check on the series <br/>
later this winter, but I will have to move my time frame up so as to <br/>
replace the notebook.  I'll take care of that shortly.   <br/>
<br/>
It's definately a great view from up on top of High Mountain and it's <br/>
great to see patriotism in action.<br/>
