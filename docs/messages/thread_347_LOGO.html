                    <div class="plaintext-content">Very nice work, Michelle.  These are exactly the types of logos we need to be<br/>
considering.  For what they're worth, here are my initial reactions, and some<br/>
random thoughts, just to get the conversation going...<br/>
<br/>
I like the map symbol for the letter A, especially as it appears in #2.<br/>
I also like the postmark symbol, as used in #5b.<br/>
<br/>
These symbols capture the orienteering and rubber stamping aspects of<br/>
letterboxing, which IMO pretty much captures the essence of the hobby.  I<br/>
would love to see both of these symbols (or at least something similar to<br/>
them) incorporated in the logo.  Do these symbols work for the rest of you?<br/>
Is the symbolism obvious?<br/>
<br/>
I know color is a secondary factor at this point, but I wanted to say that<br/>
something about the coloration of the second sketch in #5b... the blue to<br/>
green fade... appeals to me.  Very natural looking.  I no sooner write these<br/>
words, when another thought crosses my mind... does the blue/green look too<br/>
much like water?  Maybe this distracts from the idea that the wavey lines are<br/>
symbolic of a postmark, as opposed to representing my favorite sign of the<br/>
zodiac (Aquarius).  When I think of it this way, the red version looks more<br/>
like a postmark.  (I'm really bad at talking myself in circles, sometimes!!<br/>
Sorry!)<br/>
<br/>
When I think of a generic postmark, I think of a circle with writing in it,<br/>
and the wavey lines (as many as 6 or 7) out to the right hand side.  Would it<br/>
strengthen the symbolism to put the wavey lines out to the right?  Would<br/>
putting a circle around the letters be pushing it too far?  Could such a<br/>
circle lend itself to represent a compass?<br/>
<br/>
I'm very fond of the postmark symbolism, because<br/>
 (1)  a postmark is a rubber stamp<br/>
 (2)  a postmark appears on a letter... as in LETTER-boxing<br/>
<br/>
Something even less meaningful to ponder... when we were deciding how best to<br/>
shorten our name, Erik Davis pointed out that a simple websearch found several<br/>
organizations calling themselves LUSA.  The tag line for our talk list<br/>
messages contains a dash between the L and the U.  To me, this dash represents<br/>
the missing 11 letters.  Would anyone else be in favor of adding a dash to<br/>
make it L-USA?  Or is this just silliness??<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure others will have more meaningful comments regarding Michelle's<br/>
fantastic logo ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch<br/>

Liked the motifs / logos...<br/>
<br/>
As a British tutor I guess my ideas are a bit academic..<chuckle><br/>
<br/>
My favourite was the 5b..I like the franking mark...also its very clean<br/>
and tidy...The graduated cyan/turquoise shading is cool too..would this<br/>
still show in black and white or as a wallpaper as an embossed paper too ?<br/>
<br/>
Might even look good engraved on a drinking vessel....oops there goes the<br/>
other letterboxing secret .! <g><br/>

Loved the flying A though too..looked very mappish....<br/>

<br/>
I cannot believe how active this group is, and how fast thinbs happen.  I'm still trying to get the clues written for my CA box and just trying to keep current on the list, and we've got mastheads &amp; logos flying all over the place!  Very exciting stuff.<br/>
<br/>
First, my impressions before I read anyone's comments.  <br/>
<br/>
1. Absolutely loved the symbol used for the A in 1 and 2.  I saw it more as a representation of the needle in a compass (w/o which we couldn't do our thing).<br/>
2. Was confused about the wavy lines in 5b.  Thought they represented water and didn't get the connection.<br/>
3. Wondered if the discussion about the USA part of our name has been put to rest.  I'm not too sure how important the issue is to me, but some in the group made some strong points for including at the very least our northern neighbors.  For this reason, wasn'ttoo sure about using just 4 letters, with 3 of the 4 representing a limiting geography.<br/>
4. favorite was 1.<br/>
<br/>
Now, after others' input, mu thoughts (I'm sure they'll change again...hopefully)<br/>
<br/>
1. Like the symbol for A in 1 and 2 even more.  I think it's a lock!<br/>
2. Still confused about the wavy lines, but like the idea.  would be a lot less confused if they preceded the letters to the left (as in a postmark)<br/>
3. If USA is to be a part of our name (not a bad thing, just limiting), then I would definitely put a dash between the L and USA, or start a wavy line at the L which continues through the USA.  I'm rambling now:  How about 5 or 7 wavy lines starting on the left; the top and bottom ones continue trough the end, all others stop bofore the L, and the middle one(s) pick up after the L and continue through the USA. (I can see it, but I don't know if I can write it)<br/>
<br/>
Great work Michelle!<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to see where we go next!<br/>

Mitch goes on to consider water and waves....<br/>
<br/>
I guess the grass and sky is what I am seeing.......again  a domain of<br/>
Letterboxing....<br/>

<br/>
I guess the compass is ok..but would it expand and contract well on all<br/>
uses...?<br/>
<br/>
Certainly the generic postmark double ring would work too.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I'm very fond of the postmark symbolism, because<br/>
&gt; (1)  a postmark is a rubber stamp<br/>
&gt; (2)  a postmark appears on a letter... as in LETTER-boxing<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The video image name....(also on movie film..anyone remember that !)<br/>

<br/>
The dash could be another wavy line...and even run through the USA letters<br/>
like they'd been franked...or even a number of wavy lines..less distinct<br/>
than the bottom ones but ranging from top to bottom of the image.<br/>
<br/>
For this old Brit I like the clean lines of 5b maybe with the flying A<br/>
too....<br/>
<br/>
But I have trouble when I delve into imaging varying what Michele has done<br/>
.. its a bit tricky...<br/>
<br/>
I guess I still like 5b best of what I've seen.....so far <g><br/>

I like the LONG version (is this a size thing, ya think?) in blue, but see<br/>
the shortened one with the wavy postal cancellation lines as much more<br/>
practical in the long run and very nice on their own.  In the long version,<br/>
I wondered how a heavy L would look (a subtle way to indicate the LUSA<br/>
abbrev.).  Just a thought.<br/>

modified to fit each state by just adding the state name in a curve at the<br/>
bottom.  This could be cool.  It could also work for any other N American<br/>
countries, states, providences I think?  It would be easier to brainstorm<br/>
around a table, but this is pretty fun.  Are we driving you nuts Michelle?<br/>

Thanks so much for coming up with the new designs so quickly.  All of them are<br/>
fabulous in their own right!!<br/>
<br/>
Like Julie, I dig the postmark images.  I think #6 is cool, but the name is<br/>
probably too minimal.  My favorite, at this point, is probably #7, though I<br/>
also like #12 a lot.  For that matter 8a &amp; b are pretty cool, too.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at #7, I am wondering how it would look to break the circle on the<br/>
left hand side, and have the letters extend out of the circle, to the left, so<br/>
that the A ends up being in the center of the circle like a compass needle.<br/>
Maybe this would be too broken up or look unbalanced.  Still, as much as I<br/>
love the postmark symbolism, I don't want to minimize the equally important<br/>
orienteering references.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts... everything you've done looks marvelous!!!  I hope this<br/>
group approach isn't too exasperating for you.  I think it's working<br/>
wonderfully, myself.<br/>
