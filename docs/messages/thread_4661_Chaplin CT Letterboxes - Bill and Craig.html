                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm sure Bill and Craig are really wondering what happened to us on <br/>
Friday in Chaplin, so here's the short version!  We went out with our <br/>
usual group of 5, my father and two cousins he was babysitting and <br/>
another family.  There was a total of 5 adults and 6 kids.  The <br/>
oldest kid was 8 and youngest 1 year.  I may have a little bit of a <br/>
different approach to letterboxing in that I almost never read the <br/>
whole directions through before I set out.  I like the excitement of <br/>
finding out what is coming next while we are in the hunt.  I also <br/>
like to let new people try to figure it out themselves rather than <br/>
give too much direction.  This was my downfall today!  So here we all <br/>
are, we have 2 sets of clues with us for both boxes (Forgotten <br/>
Woodpile and Black Spruce Pond).  To make a long story short, we <br/>
began with one set of directions and somehow shifted to the other set <br/>
so we were looking for Forgotten Woodpile on the wrong side of the <br/>
road!  We finally figured out what we had done over an hour later (I <br/>
know, I'm a little slow!) and found Black Spruce Pond.  We came back <br/>
the next day to do Forgotten Woodpile.  Gramma Gramma is still <br/>
chuckling about the note in the Black Spruce box from Bill and Craig <br/>
wondering where Mama Duck and crew are!!!  It was a beautiful day and <br/>
we had a great hike.  The clues are excellent if you stay with the <br/>
correct set for each box!!!  <br/>
