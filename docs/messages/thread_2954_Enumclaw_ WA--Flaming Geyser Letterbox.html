Flaming Geyser State Park is a 480-acre day-use park with more than <br/>
three miles of freshwater shoreline on the Green River. The park's <br/>
most unique feature is its "geysers" (methane seeps). Park activities <br/>
include whitewater rafting, tubing, and model airplane flying.<br/>
<br/>
Located between Auburn, WA and Black Diamond, WA on the state's <br/>

I can't wait till we find the time to get up toward Seattle and get some<br/>
of the boxes up there.  Flaming Geyser has such an awesome visual image<br/>
in my head.  I look forward to finding the letterbox and achieving the<br/>
stamped image someday.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Located between Auburn, WA and Black Diamond, WA on the state's<br/>
&gt; western side.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From SR 18:<br/>
&gt; Take the Auburn-Black Diamond Rd. exit. Travel east on Auburn -Black<br/>
&gt; Diamond Rd. approximately 1/8 mile to Green Valley Rd. Turn right<br/>
&gt; (southeast) onto Green Valley Rd. Continue on Green Valley Rd. about<br/>
&gt; nine miles to park entrance. Turn right into park.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Flaming Geyser State Park has existed on this location since the<br/>
&gt; 1920's. Operated as a private park into the 1960's, it fell into<br/>
&gt; bankrupcy. State Parks rescued it from conversion to home development<br/>
&gt; and has operated it as a park ever since.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Flaming Geyser burned significantly higher before the 1960's, and<br/>
&gt; was featured in "Ripley's Believe It or Not." The park is actively<br/>
&gt; looking to obtain an original copy of the Ripley's publication that<br/>
&gt; features the geyser.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To find the letterbox, Take the Trail to the Flaming Geyser. There is<br/>
&gt; an interpretive display located at the geyser explaining how it<br/>
&gt; works. It isn't very big, but it is still impressive.<br/>
&gt; Go past the geyser on the trail to the Bubbling Geyser.  Cross over a<br/>
&gt; bridge and there will be a large fallen tree parallel to the path.<br/>
&gt; This tree points to where the letterbox is hidden!  From the<br/>
&gt; Southeastern end of the fallen tree go approx. 12 steps or 6 paces<br/>
&gt; and there will be a large tree with no top on your left.<br/>
&gt; Behind this topless tree in a cubby hole at it's base is the Flaming<br/>
&gt; Geyser Letterbox!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can continue on to see the Bubbling Geyser and/or retrace your<br/>
&gt; steps to the parking lot and picnic area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; WAIVER OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLAIMER<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing, like any outdoor sport, carries the risk of unforeseen<br/>
&gt; hazards. "Letterboxing North America" supports a policy of not<br/>
&gt; knowingly placing letterboxes in areas that will create undue risk to<br/>
&gt; the letterbox hunter. However, as conditions may vary, it is the<br/>
&gt; responsibility of the letterbox searcher to become thoroughly<br/>
&gt; familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to<br/>
&gt; adequately prepare for those conditions, and to conduct oneself<br/>
&gt; safely and responsibly with respect to those conditions and with<br/>
&gt; respect to his or her personal abilities and limitations.<br/>
&gt; "Letterboxing North America" and the individual letterbox sponsors<br/>
&gt; assume no liability for events which may occur related directly or<br/>
&gt; indirectly to one's searching for a letterbox.<br/>

 I didnt want to put that in the letterbox<br/>

not dangerous to do it yourself...the day we were<br/>
there to plant the box it was flaming and it really is<br/>
pretty.<br/>
