Hi boxers:<br/>
<br/>
I received an email from Don of Don and Gwen in CA. While many of you<br/>
may not know them, they are responsible for keeping CA full of<br/>
letterboxes! Their P count is at about 200. They also run a security<br/>
business and Don has been very vocal on the main talk list about<br/>
safety and letterboxing in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Don has emailed and I have posted some safe letterboxing hints.<br/>
Please be sure to read them. They are important to all - veteran and<br/>
newbies alike. I have ignored normal posting guidelines and will<br/>
cross-post this also on the main list - I think it's that important!<br/>
<br/>
We thank Don for taking the time and initiative to be sure we are all<br/>
aware and safe. This is an example of how veteran letterboxers<br/>
continue to give back to this pastime and are very interested in our<br/>
new recruits.<br/>
<br/>
Go to our webpage, under Special Features in the right column, click<br/>
on Letterboxing 101, and Don's security article will be linked from<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! [and be SAFE!]<br/>
<br/>
