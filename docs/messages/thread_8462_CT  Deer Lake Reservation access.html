having I've been heard about Fat Man Squeeze from the summer camp hikers.<br/>
<br/>
The ranger greeted us by saying that the property really isn't open to the<br/>
public, its for Scouts only.<br/>
<br/>
"B-b-but we're letterboxers!" I replied with my lower lip trembling. At<br/>
first he regarded this with some suspicion but then recalled someone else<br/>
saying the same thing recently...and also someone telling him about the<br/>
boxes and the website (maybe the person who planted them is my guess) but he<br/>
never really had time to followup on it...so sizing us up as looking<br/>
wholesome enough he let us head out into the woods.<br/>
<br/>
Then our big hairy dog Gordo jumped out of the car, and he told us no dogs<br/>
are allowed on the property! I promised him that we'd pick up after and he<br/>
said OK but to let other letterboxers know that positively no dogs allowed.<br/>
<br/>
He seemd to be OK with letterboxers showing up as long as we behave<br/>
ourselves nicely. (Scouts honor!;-) So leave your dogs at home for this one!<br/>
Also, I'm sure this won't be accessible when they have camp going on next<br/>
summer.<br/>
<br/>
It'd be a very good idea to check in with the ranger when doing these<br/>
trails, as a point of good will.  And, anyway, we found the trail map he<br/>
gave us essential, in some places we couldn't find blazes to let us know if<br/>
we were on the right trails otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Fat Man Squeeze lived up to my expectations and beyond, really a fun<br/>
climb/hike/scramble after we stamped in -In our family its been re-named  Yo<br/>
Mama's Been Squeezed.<br/>

                    <html><body>When we hiked in for Hermit's Grave, also on a Scout reservation, all we did was check in with the ranger in the office.  Actually, we found him on the trail and got quite an education on the Hermit and the property.  All the adult Scouters were very cordial.  But, the Hermit had been around longer than the Scout camp, so that may have been the difference.  Summer might not be the best time to go if camp is in session.<br/>
