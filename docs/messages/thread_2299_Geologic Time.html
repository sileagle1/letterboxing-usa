<div>Thank you very much S. Pike and Frogger for the 
Walk Through Geologic Time LetterboxesÂ at Dinosaur State Park in Rocky 
Hill, CT. A very pleasant walk of the surrounding trails within the park offered 
exceptionally carved stamps. Especially the "Trilobite". WOW - what a beautiful 
and large stamp. We had the distinction of being the very first visitors to 
these two new additions. We were missing the S part of our group but never the 
less we enjoyed every step. Its nice to see an "easy" letterbox or two once in a 
while to keep the kids interest. Thanks again.</div>

<br/>
Thanks for taking the time to search out our boxes.  Much thanks to <br/>
Keith for pointing out the error in the directions.  Webmaster:  <br/>
please make the correction from I-95 to I-91 before posting our clues. <br/>
  Thanks also for your great praise of the "Trilobite" stamp.  It <br/>
turned out much larger than I had originally intended (just fits a 3 x <br/>
5 index card); it may be a problem for those of you with smaller <br/>
journals.  Have many more stamps carved - just need to get our act <br/>
together and plant them.  Thanks again for the feedback.<br/>
