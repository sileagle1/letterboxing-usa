A short time ago a letterboxer named Glenn rocked the LBNA boat (again).<br/>
Randy Hall declared a Poll to see if Glenn should be banned but a the same<br/>
time unannounced he banned Glenn. Glenn won the poll 51% to 49%. It didn't<br/>
matter, seems it was a Randy Hall dog and pony poll!<br/>
<br/>
This was followed by Monica, A.D. and a few others catty types accusing Bill<br/>
Burk of evil.  A.D. posted a message Bill had sent another user in jest and<br/>
twisted it into an evil threat to others. A.D. now knows what she posted was<br/>
not true but doesn't feel the need to right her misinformation Monica spent<br/>
a week showing the true hateful person she is by kicking the dead horse<br/>
again and again.<br/>
<br/>
The end result, Glenn and Bill's clues have been pulled off the LBNA site.<br/>
Bill still has access to the LBNA group (??) but his clues aren't allowed on<br/>
the LBNA site. It is odd that a site claiming to be the "official"<br/>
Letterboxing site would blacklist users clues due to their group politics or<br/>
personality. It was one thing to ban Glenn from the talklist after Bill is<br/>
really a sorry situation. To remove all of their clues from the website is a<br/>
bit much. Now they have taken the away the pleasure many could have received<br/>
from looking for these Washington boxes. The clues caused no harm yet it<br/>
seems everyone must be punished. Bill is punished because he is Glenn's<br/>
friend. Pathetic<br/>
<br/>
Neither Randy Hall or his webmasters will respond to any mail or posts<br/>
seeking more information on this issue. At least to those that question what<br/>
happened. I wonder why? Randy had no problem making a public condemnation of<br/>
Glenn why not do the same to Bill if he has done something wrong?  Something<br/>
in LBNA land stinks!<br/>

<br/>
BTW: Since Glenn rocked the boat I see no more channeling through 5 year<br/>
olds, few if no discussion of turning Letterboxing into something else and<br/>
only moderator's pets using profanity towards others (Ryan) without<br/>
repercussions. Pretty "shitty" deal, isn't it?  Nothing worse than a group<br/>
of catty women scorned,  but their true personalities came out very clear in<br/>
the end.<br/>
<br/>
Life's a bitch sometimes! Happy boxing!<br/>

No one has asked me anything, actually.  But ...<br/>
<br/>
As I said previously, I'll let the archives speak for Glenn's (and my) <br/>
actions.  In my judgement, Glenn is a list troll who has violated the <br/>
list etiquette several times, and has violated Yahoo's terms of use.  <br/>
He was first warned, then moderated, then banned.  All of these actions<br/>
occurred as a result of _other members_ asking me to deal with him.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone on the list is free to question my judgement on this (or any) <br/>
matter, but please read the relevant archives before doing so. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, I wouldn't spin 49% of those with an opinion (and the figure was <br/>
actually higher) wanting you banned from the list, as a "win".<br/>
<br/>
(and yes, I've banned Glenn's 5th e-mail account)<br/>
