Spanish-speaking countries.  I see that some people,<br/>
have taken the initiative to place letterboxes in<br/>
other countries.  Again, admittedly, we haven't really<br/>
analyzed the clues really thoroughly, but we were<br/>
saying it's kind of a shame that although the<br/>
letterboxes are outside of the country, for all<br/>
intents and purposes, access to them is limited to<br/>
foreign tourists and English speakers.  We think this<br/>
is really unfortunate, but we had an idea.  <br/>
<br/>
Between the two of us, we can only really cover<br/>
English, SPanish, and Portuguese (my French is<br/>
terrible!)   but (not necessarily right away) We could<br/>
translate clues located in Spanish-speaking countries<br/>
into Spanish.  But then we were thinking that a Native<br/>
Spanish speaker is still not terribly likely to wander<br/>
upon letterboxing as the site is in English.  Now,<br/>
we're both educators so our free time tends to fall in<br/>
the summers, but I think we could also volunteer to<br/>
translate some parts of the LBNA page to Spanish.  We<br/>
figure if it really is to be LBNA and not LBUSACAN, it<br/>
probably should promote letterboxing to Non-English<br/>
speakers.<br/>
<br/>
If the clues are really only accesible to foreign<br/>
tourists, it seems like the environmental impact might<br/>
outweigh actual usage for a foreign-placed letterbox. <br/>
Once finished, we could pursue maybe getting a link to<br/>
the site in some of the Spanish language search<br/>
engines.  <br/>
<br/>
Is this a good idea or are we barking up the wrong<br/>
tree???<br/>
<br/>
Jim and Jen<br/>
