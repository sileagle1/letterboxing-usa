                    <div class="plaintext-content">in 2 weeks i will be taking a few of my friends out letterboxing with <br/>
me and i would like to make a signature stamp for them. Gary and Becky <br/>
are thier names and i wanted to come up with a cute stamp for them. <br/>
the first thing that came to mind was a railroad card from monopoly. <br/>
with all the different monopoly games out there, i am having a hard <br/>
time looking for an original railroad card. i know that the closest i <br/>
would come would be B&amp;O Railroad, but i plan on changing that to B&amp;G <br/>
Railroad. is there anyone out there that can take a picture of the <br/>
railroad card and send it to me?any help would be great help. thanks.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sure, I can scan one in for you if no one has already.  If you like, I could probably even <br/>
change the text to B&amp;G so that you could transfer it immediately to the stamp medium.  <br/>
Would you like a grayscale JPEG file?<br/>
<br/>
Not a big deal to do--I have to use PhotoShop all the time for my job, so it won't take <br/>
more than about two seconds to do.  If you get me the specifics quickly enough, I can <br/>
probably get you a file tomorrow.<br/>

never answered my last offer (sent to you off list) to send you the<br/>
photo, so I assumed you already had it.  Most likely the assumption<br/>
everyone else made.  Choose one of the folks who offered and e-mail<br/>
them personally off list and ask for it.  I get a digest of this board<br/>
once a day, but I check my personal e-mail all throughout the day as<br/>
I'm working.<br/>
