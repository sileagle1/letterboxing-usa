2 days ago my disc golfing letterboxing boyfriend was at Burke lake <br/>
playing Disc Golf.  He is pretty good and just turned Pro in <br/>
January.  He was near one of the baskets and saw something unusual <br/>
so he went over to investigate (he was also picking up trash at the <br/>
time).  Turns out it was a The kiwi letterbox. He asked me to see if <br/>
it was posted yet.  It was sitting out not under any sticks or <br/>
leaves or anyting and he said it was a fairly large box.  I havn't <br/>
seen this one posted so I hope I haven't spoiled anything here.   <br/>
<br/>
He didn't stamp in, but did rehid it where he thought it might have <br/>
been and was sure to put alot of sticks and leaves on it. He said <br/>
where he thought the box was hidden is in the middle of the Disc <br/>
Golf course and people are constintly throwing very close to this <br/>
location.  Just to let you know During the past month over 2000 <br/>
people sighned in and played disc golf at Burke Lake park.<br/>
<br/>
Both of us know that Disc Golfers can be very distructive and he was <br/>
concerned that the box might not last too long where it is. I think <br/>
his biggest concern was that one of the disc golfers would destroy <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping not to offend anyone<br/>

PS Burke Lake is a great park and needs more Letterboxes there :^)<br/>
