<br/>
But I thought the original poster wasn't asking that sort of question since<br/>
they didn't ask what made a poor quality box but, rather, they asked what<br/>
made a poorly *planted* box.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of that is going to depend on the qualities of the finder, in my<br/>
opinion.  I think the better hidden boxes are in places where it's unlikely<br/>
they'll be discovered by muggles and even where it's unlikely that box<br/>
searchers will be seen by muggles since more and more boxers are using less<br/>
and less discretion.<br/>
<br/>
And possibly, using hiding spots that seem the most likely to still be<br/>
around for awhile.  To the best of the placer's knowledge at least.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
A poorly planted box might be one that's smack dab in the middle of a patch<br/>
of poison ivy.<br/>
<br/>
A poorly planted box might also be one that's smack dab in the middle of a<br/>
sensitive patch of woods that's home to endangered or threatened plants or<br/>
animals.<br/>
<br/>
A poorly planted box might be one that's placed in an airport or near a<br/>
power plant, etc., in other words, someplace where security might be a<br/>
little more sensitive since 9/11.<br/>
<br/>
A poorly planted box might be one covered in camo-tape and placed too near<br/>
to a government building.<br/>
<br/>
A poorly planted box might be one attached to, say, the underside of a<br/>
Postal collection box.  (I know some folks like to do this with letterboxes,<br/>
but it's actually not at all allowed and us postal workers are trained to<br/>
panic if we see something like this, and with the lack of discretion<br/>
nowadays on the part of finders, I'd be too worried about the<br/>
lack-of-discretion issue to plant a box there.)<br/>

<br/>
  Being totally new, the boxes I've planted have been with store bought stamps.  Although they don't necessarily reflect the area they've been planted in, they do follow a them.<br/>
<br/>
  I'm thinking of eventually replacing the store-bought stamps with hand made ones, but that will probably not happen until I'm more experienced and some magic fairy comes along and endows me with more spare time than I have!<br/>
<br/>
  At any rate, I really appreciate y our answer, and the answers of the others.  Anything you say is a learning experience for me :)<br/>

A poorly planted box might be one attached to, say, the underside of a<br/>
Postal collection box. (I know some folks like to do this with letterboxes,<br/>
but it's actually not at all allowed and us postal workers are trained to<br/>
panic if we see something like this, and with the lack of discretion<br/>
nowadays on the part of finders, I'd be too worried about the<br/>
lack-of-discretion issue to plant a box there.)<br/>

Ok, what is considered a poor quality stamp? Are all store bought stamps<br/>
considered<br/>
of poor quality?<br/>

Those that have no relation to the area that they are planted.<br/>
Those that are planted to to "have" a box planted (in other words, no<br/>
thought put into it.)<br/>

For me, it's not so much "poor quality" as it is disappointing.  I'm just not interested in hiking through the woods and following clues to find something that sits on a shelf at Michael's or A.C. Moore.  I usually don't bother to find a LB if I know it has a store-bought stamp.  I prefer the most hacky kid-carved stamp to a store-bought stamp. :)<br/>
