                    <div class="plaintext-content">I spent the last week in Biloxi, Miss visiting family.  Had the chance to try <br/>
to box in Gautier (Jackson county) and Saucier (Harrison county).  Neither <br/>
box locations were available.  Not because the boxes werent there-they very well <br/>
may have been. but FEMA has taken over the state and national parks as <br/>
'parking places' for their relif trailers and the parks are off limits for 18 mos to <br/>
3 year.  That was according to a ranger/caretaker we met at one of them.  so, <br/>
that shot my boxing time there.  And we werent in New Orleans in daylight <br/>
long enough to even attempt to box so I can't really report on any of those.  I <br/>
did see in the paper that the golf course in City Park was to open in 2 weeks.  <br/>
Just thought you'd like to know...<br/>
BookWorm in CT again<br/>
