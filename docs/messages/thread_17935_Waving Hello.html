<br/>
I am always excited to see more famlies invovled!  What part of the coutnry<br/>
are you located in?<br/>
<br/>
Onething you will learn quickly--there are no rules, but lots of opinions,<br/>
lol, so here are my thoughts in response to your questions...<br/>
<br/>
Yes you can place a box in a place that requirs admission.  Many of hte<br/>
parks  here in my area require a yearly pass.  OF ocurse, if hte admission<br/>
is steep, people may choose not to find htat particular box and I would also<br/>
consider seeking permission otherwise the box will most likely be removed by<br/>
"personell"/  Oh--be sure to mention admission at the top of your clues to<br/>
avoid any nasty surprises!<br/>
<br/>
My personal rule on journals/.stamps:  My older two chldren (ages 6 and 4<br/>
when we started) got their on journals and stamps right away.  My baby  did<br/>
not.  I told hte older two that until she could stamp in on her own, she<br/>
couldn't have one.  Now that she si nearly two she has been practicing<br/>
stamping and will get her own set this spring.  I will use discretion when<br/>
stamping into otehrs logs--I don't wnat her carelessness to rin it!  And,<br/>
for what it is worth, I often stmap into my older daughters log even when<br/>
she is not with us as she really loves the images.  I do not stamp her into<br/>
the placers log tho. And I keep a master log of who was with me when, for<br/>
"count" puposes.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I think the logo stamp is really great.  Hopefully, someday I will<br/>
come across it!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello to all.  I am new to Letterboxing and have a few<br/>
&gt; questions.  I did read the FAQ's and hope these have not been<br/>
&gt; asked too often.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A link was posted on our local homeschool support group email<br/>
&gt; loop.  There was some interest, so we started a "club".   So<br/>
&gt; far this club has 4 families and with 12 kids (aged 5 mo to<br/>
&gt; 10 years).  We are meeting  twice a month.   Our first<br/>
&gt; meeting we had everyone design and carve their personal<br/>
&gt; stamps.  Next meeting we are going to hunt our first box.<br/>
&gt; Then we are going to start placing them once we get the<br/>
&gt; "feel" of the sport.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here are my questions:  Can  we place a box in a place that<br/>
&gt; requires admission price,  such as a local zoo? Also, if we<br/>
&gt; come up with a box as a group, and all go out and place<br/>
&gt; it.... do all members present get to count as a "P"#?    We<br/>
&gt; also have some very young members- from infants to toddlers<br/>
&gt; who are basically 'along for the ride'.  Their older siblings<br/>
&gt; want them to have their own journals/stamps.  Would it be<br/>
&gt; improper to stamp them in the journals- as they did not<br/>
&gt; actively help with the discovery/planting?   And lastly, the<br/>
&gt; kids voted on a "logo" for our group and are making a stamp-<br/>
&gt; can we put this logo stamp above all our signature stamps- or<br/>
&gt; is it limited to "real" people?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you for your time, and I am looking forward to learning<br/>
&gt; more here.<br/>

The first rule of Letterboxing Club is No One Talks About Letterboxing Club, the second rule of Letterboxing Club is No One Talks About Letterboxing Club!<br/>
Oops, wrong club!<br/>
<br/>
The first rule of Letterboxing is that there are no rules! Even if Ryan is doing his best to get them all written down. ; -)<br/>
<br/>
You certainly can feel free to place a letterbox in a fee area. There are many in parks that require an entrance fee. Just be sure to note it in the clues so people are prepared.<br/>
<br/>
I think that many families use one log book, but again, it is entirely up to the individual. If each child wants their own log book and stamp, I say go for it.<br/>
<br/>
I like your idea of a group logo stamped above everyone else's stamp in the log book. Just keep in mind that crowds draw attention and try not to give away a box location to non-letterboxers that may disturb the box later. And also, the idea of many boxers is to make as little impact on the surrounding environment as possible, so be careful about what your group might be trodding on.<br/>
<br/>
I think this can be a great group activity and teaching tool for showing kids respect for their environment and all the life in it. (Sorry, not to get too tree huggy on you.) <br/>

Have Fun<br/>

We are also new to letterboxing, only since January. My son, my sister, myself and three dogs comprise "Hikers and Hounds". We do have a team stamp with that name on it and an image, but we also each have a personal stamp. Since the three of us can't always get together and each of us prefers different aspects of this hobby this is what we've found works for us. Whenever we find a box we stamp it with the team stamp and then the personal stamps of whoever was there that day. I love to hike and hunt so I am out there the most, (but have great difficulty finding any boxes.)  My son Carmen loves to carve and hide, which I hate, so he will not be stamping as many logs as I but the team stamp (which he carved) is there. Also, we've decided not to count. We are a lazy group by nature and not at all competive so the counts mean nothing to us. Plus, we're not really good at counting anyway, the hounds are much better at it than we are. And the cool thing is, we don't have to! This is the<br/>
 type of hobby that you can really make your own, in whatever way suits you best. Have fun with it, we're having a blast!<br/>

Nice to see other families joining.  From personal experience boxing with a large group can be fun but taxing.  There are 7 children ages 4 - 13 and two moms in the Alphabet Bandits and after a year and a half of individual stamps were are now carving a Team Stamp....  Even though we had it down to a science and could stamp in an out in under 10 minutes (down from 25 the first couple of times LOL), we have since opted for a team stamp and are debating small individual stamps to go underneath.<br/>
<br/>
We've chosen to place stamps in our kids/family series in free places and have a couple of general stamps planned for places with entrance fees.  We've decided not to place family or kid oriented boxes in places where you have to pay, since our two familis are on a strict bugdet and entrance fees would be prohibitive for us.<br/>

As many have already said before, yes, you can hide letterboxes that <br/>
require admission prices.  Many, many boxes are tucked around the <br/>
country that require admission prices (including Disneyland, it <br/>
seems!)  As for zoos, the Portland Zoo (the one in Oregon, at least) <br/>
is (was?) home to several letterboxes.  But keep in mind, in such <br/>
high traffic and well-manicured areas, letterboxes in such locations <br/>
tend to suffer VERY short lifetimes.  If you want a box that will <br/>
last for years and years, amusement parks and zoos are NOT a good <br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Also, if we come up with a box as a group, and all go out and place<br/>
&gt; it.... do all members present get to count as a "P"#?    <br/>
<br/>
That's probably up to the individual person and if they feel they <br/>
deserve a P for their effort.  Generally, the person or persons that <br/>
put effort into writing the clue and physically go out to hide the <br/>
box are the ones that have a good claim for a P.  Those that just <br/>
watch others plant the box don't.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And lastly, the kids voted on a "logo" for our group and are making<br/>
&gt; a stamp-  can we put this logo stamp above all our signature stamps-<br/>
&gt; or is it limited to "real" people?<br/>
<br/>
If you are going out as a large group with more than a few people, <br/>
I'd even go so far as to recommend using ONLY a logo stamp for <br/>
stamping in!  With a group of five or ten people, it can take <br/>
freaking forever to log in if every single person needs to do it.  <br/>
It's not a rule, certainly, but from a logistics standpoint, it's <br/>
very beneficial to use a group logo when you're out with a group.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, many logbooks are limited in size, and a party of ten <br/>
dropping by could fill the book to capacity much quicker than <br/>
planned.  A non-intrusive logo stamp would help insure there's plenty <br/>
of room for others that come after you to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

<br/>
We are a family of 5, and I had never thought of a Family Logo Stamp.<br/>
We each have our own stamp... well, the kids have theirs and my husband<br/>
and I have one.  My 13 year old stamps in herself and has her own log<br/>
book.  My 2 younger kids (18 months and 3 years) have their own books,<br/>
but we stamp in for them.  At this time, my husband and I don't have a<br/>
log book - we just get to look back at the kids books =]<br/>
<br/>
So, all in all, we make 4 stamps in the LB log book and we have 4 log<br/>
books of our own to stamp in to.  Our stamps are small (1" x 1"), so<br/>
when we do stamp in, we do not take up too much space.<br/>
<br/>
I will have to reconsider the family logo stamp... and then just those<br/>
that go could use their individual stamp too....<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the ideas! =]<br/>

Hey there!<br/>
<br/>
As many have already said before, yes, you can hide letterboxes that <br/>
require admission prices.  Many, many boxes are tucked around the <br/>
country that require admission prices (including Disneyland, it <br/>
seems!)  As for zoos, the Portland Zoo (the one in Oregon, at least) <br/>
is (was?) home to several letterboxes.  But keep in mind, in such <br/>
high traffic and well-manicured areas, letterboxes in such locations <br/>
tend to suffer VERY short lifetimes.  If you want a box that will <br/>
last for years and years, amusement parks and zoos are NOT a good <br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Also, if we come up with a box as a group, and all go out and place<br/>
&gt; it.... do all members present get to count as a "P"#?    <br/>
<br/>
That's probably up to the individual person and if they feel they <br/>
deserve a P for their effort.  Generally, the person or persons that <br/>
put effort into writing the clue and physically go out to hide the <br/>
box are the ones that have a good claim for a P.  Those that just <br/>
watch others plant the box don't.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And lastly, the kids voted on a "logo" for our group and are making<br/>
&gt; a stamp-  can we put this logo stamp above all our signature stamps-<br/>
&gt; or is it limited to "real" people?<br/>
<br/>
If you are going out as a large group with more than a few people, <br/>
I'd even go so far as to recommend using ONLY a logo stamp for <br/>
stamping in!  With a group of five or ten people, it can take <br/>
freaking forever to log in if every single person needs to do it.  <br/>
It's not a rule, certainly, but from a logistics standpoint, it's <br/>
very beneficial to use a group logo when you're out with a group.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, many logbooks are limited in size, and a party of ten <br/>
dropping by could fill the book to capacity much quicker than <br/>
planned.  A non-intrusive logo stamp would help insure there's plenty <br/>
of room for others that come after you to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
<br/>

Others have answered some of  your questions, but I just wanted to say that <br/>
it is not uncommon for 'little ones' and pets to have their own stamps (heck, <br/>
at the Molly-Ginger gathering this past year I think I had almost as many dogs' <br/>
stamps as I had human stamps!). Additionally, there are some families that <br/>
have a family stamps AND individual stamps ( some of which are highly coveted as <br/>
"exchanges" at gatherings).<br/>
<br/>
As we always say, there are no rules, so do whatever makes you happy (as the <br/>
little ones get older, they'll probably appreciate - in their own way- that <br/>
they were included all along).<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

We also have some very young members- from infants to toddlers who are <br/>
basically 'along for the ride'.  Their older siblings want them to have their own <br/>
journals/stamps.  Would it be improper to stamp them in the journals- as they <br/>
did not actively help with the discovery/planting?   And lastly, the kids voted <br/>
