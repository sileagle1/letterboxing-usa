 I just got home from our local wally world and thought I'd pass this along.  In the craft area they had a big bin of (what I suppose are) discontinued rubber stamps.  All sizes were $0.20.  I originally passed by the box thinking "discontinued stamps - probably hideous designs" but then the lightbulb went off....  Wow - 20 cent mounting blocks (once I peel the old rubberstamps off).  Some of these were as big as 3x4 inch stamps.  Also in this .20 bin were "name" rubberstamps with their own stamppads - sized to fit the stamp.  These were odd shaped being an inch or so wide and 3-4 inces long depending on the length of the name.  Still - I thought it an interesting idea for 20 cents - So you might check in with your local wally worlds to see what their sales bins have.<br/>
