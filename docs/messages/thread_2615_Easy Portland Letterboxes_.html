<br/>
I'm going to be visting Portland in a couple weeks, and thought I might look <br/>
for my frist letterbox(es) while I'm there.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone recomend some that can be done in street clothes?  I dont know <br/>
the city at all, but Im pretty good finding my way around with enough time <br/>
and a street map.<br/>
<br/>
I thought the 'PCC Sylvania Campus' boxes looked doable.  Any others?<br/>

Some of the boxes at the Tualatin Hills Nature Park are located very near<br/>
paved paths.<br/>
<br/>
The Rock Creek series are mostly on dry ground.  You can definitely bag them<br/>
without serious hiking gear.<br/>
<br/>
I have hunted several of Amanda's boxes.  "Who Let the Dogs Out" is a fairly<br/>
easy hiking path.<br/>
<br/>
You might get a little dusty, a blackberry bramble or two and dirty knees,<br/>
but beyond that, I can't imagine too much trouble in street clothes....<br/>
depending on your definition of street clothes!<br/>
