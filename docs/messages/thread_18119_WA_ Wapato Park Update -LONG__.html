                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well...some are missing and a couple that were reported to be missing <br/>
aren't! But overall the letterboxes in the park have done some <br/>
languishing. It seems to me that the boxes that are "out in the open" <br/>
are all fine yet the ones that are really hidden back in the <br/>
trails/forested areas have suffered the greatest! I don't know if its <br/>
because they are in "secluded" areas that the local "ner-do-wells" <br/>
hang out at or what. <br/>
<br/>
But here is an update..we tracked down every box in the park. There <br/>
were only two that we haven't found before but I didn't have all the <br/>
stamps in my logbook so that's why we "powerboxed" the whole shebang. <br/>
<br/>
FUDRICK'S:<br/>
Red Squirrel is completely missing! Along with the hitchiker we <br/>
deposited there back in December. So unless anyone has visited the <br/>
box since December they both are gone. No traces of anything and we <br/>
searched all around the general area.<br/>
<br/>
Dive On In is alive and well there was even a visitor there earlier <br/>
this month! Some names I didn't recognize and I saw that Amanda from <br/>
Seattle had visited just recently.<br/>
<br/>
El Gaucho has departed to whom knows where. The entire area has been <br/>
recently "camped" in from what it looks like. IT may of been cleaned <br/>
out when the "transient" that apparently camped there was "evicted" <br/>
by the parks dept and Tacoma Police Dept. I know that on Jan 2nd it <br/>
was alive and well as we launched a hitchhiker there. <br/>
<br/>
SCOUT DOGS:<br/>
Evil Yoda has been kidnapped! He was there on Jan 2nd but was not to <br/>
be found anywhere. We went round and round the three trees digging <br/>
and looking and scoured the general area. Alas this one really "chaps <br/>
my hide" as it was a wonderfully carved stamp! One would of sworn <br/>
that it was machine made because the detail work on it was awesome!!!<br/>
<br/>
CHUCK STRAUB:<br/>
Wolfman was reported as missing a couple of months ago when Silver <br/>
Eagle was here. He is most definetly gone but the string that he was <br/>
hanging by still remains!! We said a breif prayer for his safety and <br/>
hope that whomever captured him appreciates him and had better hope <br/>
that the Wolfman doesn't rise and bite him/her.<br/>
<br/>
RAYVENHAUS:<br/>
Casper's Cousin Carl was pillaged earlier this winter and to my <br/>
knowledge hasn't been replaced.<br/>
<br/>
Trace Bats: ALIVE AND WELL...the fourth time was a charm. I found it <br/>
today after three previous attempts. I actually had to abandon my <br/>
attempt around 11am this morning since some kids were fishing right <br/>
by where we thought the box may be. So we came back around 1pm and <br/>
after two trips to the "twins" and back to the bench to consult the <br/>
compass I found the proper set of "tombstones". THis box is in great <br/>
shape ...albeit...a little lonely ...most likely the result of <br/>
several "missing" reports.<br/>
<br/>
Grim Reaper: Alive and well...has been found by more "Geocachers" <br/>
than "Letterboxers". We pulled our "Snow Daze 2004" HH out of it <br/>
since there hasn't been a visitor there since Jan. 2nd when we <br/>
launched it. The HH was carved to celebrate the "Week of Snow" we had <br/>
at the beginning of 2004!<br/>
<br/>
Evil Jack O. Lanturn:  I think that he has probably ended up <br/>
somewhere with ElGaucho. Since they were in the same "glade". This <br/>
was another one of the ones we had found back in Nov/Dec so we knew <br/>
exactly where it was.<br/>
<br/>
Mummy Dearest: Been missing for a long time! Wierd thing is that it <br/>
is probably in the most remote area of all!! Heck I grew up playing <br/>
in this park and I didn't even know this trail existed.<br/>
<br/>
Singing for my Supper: Was reported missing but is ALIVE!! In fact I <br/>
had to carry the box around for 30 minutes because a family had <br/>
settled in at the picnic table and volleyball court nearby as we were <br/>
at the bench stamping.<br/>
<br/>
Finally...I had heard a rumor of another box hidden in the park but <br/>
couldn't find any clues to it. So...dvn2r skr...decided after we had <br/>
met up and she stamped in the "Hearts Across America" PLB that she <br/>
needed to check on a certain "Scaredy Cat" to see if it was still <br/>
hiding..sure enough! The kitty was still there all snug behind the <br/>
rock!<br/>
<br/>
All in all it was a fun afternoon of boxing and I am happy to report <br/>
that all is not lost int he park and if you talk to the right person <br/>
you can get a clue to a "secret" box aka a "Scaredy Cat".<br/>
<br/>

OOOhhh...thank you for the update! Since I've moved out of area, it's <br/>
nice to hear about my box. Kudos on finding "Trace Bats"-I never did! <br/>
And "Wolfman" was AWESOME!! I hope whoever stole it gets really, <br/>
really bad nightmares about werewolves. I even planted an "inspired <br/>
by" box based on it's unique placement in Missouri this winter. <br/>
<br/>
And best of all, my box is secret, neener neener neener! Thats kind <br/>
of exciting.<br/>
