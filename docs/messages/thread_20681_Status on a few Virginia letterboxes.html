Hello,<br/>
<br/>
"P-U Letterbox":  Well hidden and easy to get to--especially if you <br/>
don't mind heights...If you have to drive on I-81 past Edinburg, it's <br/>
worth the quick stop.<br/>
<br/>
"Where the Poison Ivy Leaf Grows":  A little trouble finding the <br/>
correct boxwood, and lots of sticker covered runners.  Box was dry <br/>
and in good shape.  Logbook slightly damp, but OK.<br/>
<br/>
"In the Park--Sports Series #3":  Wow, this one is well-bagged.  Nice <br/>
box, stamp and a good park.  Everything dry and in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
"Clark's Crossing":  Be careful getting this one.  Part of the trail <br/>
that run's by the creek looks like it's been seriously eroded during <br/>
last rash of big storms to come through.  Parking lot for the park, <br/>
as of this evening, it completely torn up as new curbs and street are <br/>
going in.  Lot's of "Do Not Enter" signs...;-).  It's a quick scamper <br/>
though to the park behind the construction though.  The box is in <br/>
decent shape, dry, but logbook is a touch damp.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
