                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a great time we all had at the Riverbend gathering!  It was so nice to <br/>
meet everyone and to see that they were truly excited to meet us too (that's <br/>
the Sally Fields part "they like me, they really like me!"<br/>
<br/>
I will admit -- we were a little nervous about going.  We were already <br/>
running late 'cause of Da's tennis (the second match of which got rained out <br/>
-- poor Da!)  We parked in the lot where everyone else had not parked and <br/>
wandered across the field.  At first we didn't see anyone.  And then -- the <br/>
migration began.  We saw a column of people making their way over.  Did they <br/>
seem letterboxerish?  Did they have backpacks?  Ah heck -- they were all <br/>
carrying lots of food so we figured we were going to join that picnic no <br/>
matter what!  With a tentative "are you all boxers" we joined the melee!<br/>
<br/>
So many logbooks and so many stamps -- the ink was flying!  Be took a moment <br/>
to get over his shyness but Ma got right in the mood.  Once again, off she <br/>
went, introducing herself to lots of adults I probably didn't even get to <br/>
meet.  For all those she spoke to -- believe only half of what she tells <br/>
you!  Unless it's about Ha, and then it is probably true!<br/>
<br/>
Now, I am one who is normally really bad at remembering names and faces.  <br/>
And now it was names, faces, trail names, stamps, boxes placed.....HELP!  <br/>
So, for those I met on Saturday (and forced to smell my new leather logbook <br/>
-- just like the stable minus the manure--) please don't be offended if I <br/>
walk right by you on the trail or try and introduce ourselves again.  It's a <br/>
problem -- and I'm working on it.  I can guarantee though, if I meet you and <br/>
you offer me a yodel, hoho, or any other chocolate covered confection -- <br/>
your face will forever be imprinted in whatever Mommy brain cells I have <br/>
left!<br/>
<br/>
As others have said -- it was a great experience!  Just like meeting people <br/>
you feel you already know through posts and log book entries.  But now you <br/>
get to see what they really look like and how they really are (now be honest <br/>
-- were we louder than you expected?!...)<br/>
<br/>
The camaraderie was wonderful!  The event stamps beautiful!  The food was <br/>
plentiful.  Thank you to those who remembered to bring utensils -- it could <br/>
have been very messy!  Thank you to whomever brought the KFC -- something Be <br/>
actually ate (did you see how skinny he is?  He eats nothing!)<br/>
<br/>
We didn't get a chance to find the new Riverbend boxes or to snag the ones <br/>
we have yet to find.  We'll save that for another day!  We were grateful to <br/>
make it back to the car before the rain. Ever since that fateful trip to the <br/>
Statue of Liberty in that tremendous downpour Miss Ma has panicked at the <br/>
thought of heavy rain (and refuses to visit anymore national monuments...)<br/>
<br/>
So thank you to everyone and Gaabriel for organizing the whole thing.  We <br/>
had a great time!  BeMa<br/>

We had a great time, too. We can put names to about a half <br/>
dozen names and faces--pretty good for me! Hope to see many <br/>
familiar faces on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
I heard great things about your Butterfinger cookies, but they <br/>
were all gone by the time I got around to dessert :-( Can you post <br/>
the recipe or share it with me off list?<br/>
