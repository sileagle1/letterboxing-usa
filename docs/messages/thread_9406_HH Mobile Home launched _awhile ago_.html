letterbox 'Mobile Home' was launched during the South Sound <br/>
Letterbox Quest Fest on 2 Nov 2002 in Lakewood, WA.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is dedicated to children of US military <br/>
servicemembers known as 'service brats' who move quite frequently <br/>
throughout their childhood and get used to moving from home to home <br/>
(the quintessential 'mobile' home) every couple of years as their <br/>
parents are stationed at military installations around the world <br/>
defending their country.<br/>
<br/>
Happy &amp; safe travels 'Mobile Home'.<br/>
