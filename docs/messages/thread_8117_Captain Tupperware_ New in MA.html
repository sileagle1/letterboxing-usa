<br/>The Captain Tupperware Letterbox
<br/>placed September 11, 2002
<br/>Turners Falls, Hamden Co, MA

<br/>
<br/>Placed in honor of <a href="http://www.chris.piloot.com"> Christoffer Carstanjan</a>, who shared our love for a fabulous cult bike, the Honda Pacific Coast. Chris was an avid motorcyclist and a standout among <a href="http://www.pc800.net"> IPCRC</a> members for years.
<br/>
<br/>The Pacific Coast was one of the first fully-faired motorcycles, completely encased in smooth shiny plastic withno unsightly mechanical bits showing. There are wonderful aftermarketstickers available for this bike that read "Body By Tupperware."
<br/>
<br/>Chris was sometimes known as "Captain Tupperware" and was on his way to the annual Great Pacific Coast Motorcycle Ride on September 11th, 2001, when he was lost at the World Trade Center.
<br/>
<br/>Chris built his home and lived in Turners Falls, Massachusetts:OnI-91, take exit 27 and follow MA Rte. 2. Just east of Turners Falls, enterthe Barton Cove Natural Area. This spot is a wonderful peninsula in the Falls River with a campground and a nature trail. It's a perfect place for paddle sports, and the letterbox can easily be found by canoe or kayak. We rode in on our Pacific Coast and hiked it: figure about one mile and one hour using these directions. The park closes for snow and some trails may close during the wet season. There are also orienteering maps available ifyou're interested.
<br/>
<br/>Park at the first Natural Area spot, before the turn-off to the campground. Walk southwest up the road a short way to the silver diamond trail and head west to a terrific observation platform. The trail continues south, steeply downhill and then up a stairway to some great ledges. Turn right, then right again on the campground road. Pass by a Nature Trail sign and soon find the silver diamonds again, turning right off the road. Follow the trail up and down, over some more stairs and then westwards along the peninsula. At the "T" go right, downhill, then turn left at the "Y" and again walk westwards with the river off 100 yards to the right (this part of the trail was in poor repair with lots of downed trees at the beginning).The westwards trail ends at the river and a stone fireplace (we hauled out a big bag of fisherman's garbage: you might consider doing the same kindness).
<br/>
<br/>Just south of the fireplace is a triple-trunked beech (look for the smooth bark to identify this one). The Captain Tupperware letterbox is just behind.You can return as you came. We also explored the well-marked nature trail,which was a real treat.
<br/>
<br/>Ride on, Chris!
