                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't usually like to get involved in these little domestic <br/>
squabbles, but I don't take well to being told to SHUT UP either,so <br/>
here's my three cents:  <br/>
<br/>
1.  In just a little more than one year of letterboxing, we have <br/>
found well over 800 boxes and only 30 of them have been hitchers.  <br/>
That's LESS THAN 4%, folks!  (Doesn't exactly sound like the market <br/>
is flooded yet to me!)<br/>
<br/>
2. Vic and Val, after what I presume to have been several years (?) <br/>
of letterboxing, actually seemed quite content JUST A FEW SHORT <br/>
MONTHS AGO to find their VERY FIRST HITCHER at one of our boxes.  <br/>
(Yes, we check!)  Now that they have grabbed a couple more, suddenly <br/>
they feel like COMPLAINING?!?!?!  Well, all I can say is that if <br/>
certain folks do not like finding hitchers without the big bang <br/>
surprise element, then we would prefer that they either not come to <br/>
our boxes or that they leave any hitcher that might be found there <br/>
for other more appreciative letterboxers.  We WANT our boxes to be <br/>
known for hitchers!( but mostly for newcomers, not for opportunists!)<br/>
<br/>
3.  We just LOVE finding hitchers, whether we find them by accident, <br/>
by hunch, by hint, or by dint of diligent research!  We also love <br/>
hearing about other folks placing and finding hitchers - even those <br/>
we'll probably never see - as that has been a good way for us to <br/>
share vicariously in their joys and journeys.  We'd hate to lose that <br/>
just because some folks might get annoyed, frustrated, or even <br/>
envious hearing about hitchers that they may or may not find.  For <br/>
those who would complain about lack of secrecy or surprise, I still <br/>
like Laurette's suggestion that they simply delete offensive <br/>
messages,avoid known haunts, and MONITOR THEIR EXPECTATIONS!!!  It <br/>
seems to me that folks who go out letterboxing nowadays EXPECTING to <br/>
find hitchers (either because they think there are too many or think <br/>
that they know where they are) are much more likely to end up <br/>
GRUMBLING, DISAPPOINTED and UNHAPPY, no matter how many they find, <br/>
whereas, for US, hitchers will always remain a DELIGHTFUL and <br/>
PRECIOUS SURPRISE, no matter how many there are or how much we know <br/>
of their whereabouts!  I like to think of hitchers as little good <br/>
will ambassadors that encourage kindness, sharing, responsibility, <br/>
and cooperation.  It's so nice to see people working together to keep <br/>
those hitchers moving for EVERYONE'S enjoyment.  If fact right now I <br/>
can only think of one instance where someone personally kept a <br/>
hitcher out of circulation for OVER SIX MONTHS!  (Yes, Tom, that <br/>
would be you with BURR from Nov 00 - Jun 01--- definitely not a good <br/>
way to keep the game afoot for others!   :-)  )  Anyway, it's great <br/>
to see so many people  that are willing to share and spread the JOY <br/>
of hitchers, so I sincerely hope that we can all keep it up!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
