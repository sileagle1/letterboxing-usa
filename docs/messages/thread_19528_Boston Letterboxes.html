The Boston Harbor Islands are run by both the National Park Service <br/>
and by the Massachusett's Department of Conservation and Recreation.  <br/>
I'm not sure which Island's are run by which group.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe www.bostonharborislands.org will tell you that.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, I was just out on Thompson Island for three days in <br/>
June...it was GREAT!<br/>
