                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings all, I'm new to letterboxing and so ofcourse, I haven't <br/>
been through the frustrations that knowing your letterbox is missing <br/>
must cause you.  Having said that, however,  on my first letterboxing <br/>
excursion, several weeks ago, I did run across a location with a <br/>
missing box.  My first thought was, hey, I bet some two-legged rat <br/>
stole it.  After joining this message board, I can see that this is a <br/>
recurring problem.  If it is happening here in the United States, I <br/>
bet it has also happened either in the past and/or present in <br/>
England.  Does anyone know how it has been handled there?  We may not <br/>
have to re-invent the wheel if someone (or a group) has found <br/>
something before us that works.  Just a thought!  <br/>

I figured this might be a topic of conversation when our little group meets with Dartmoor 'boxers in England in a couple of weeks. We can ask them.<br/>
