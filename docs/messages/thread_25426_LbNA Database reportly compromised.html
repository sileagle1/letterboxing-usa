They contacted me first thinking it was a breach on Atlas Quest along with a link to the data that was dumped. So I've seen the link, but I'm not posting it publicly for obvious reasons. The data didn't come from AQ, though, it was definitely from LbNA. Besides being labeled "letterboxing.org", I use different passwords for every website and my account information was in this list including my password used ONLY on LbNA.

I still think it's a good idea for everyone to change your LbNA password along with any other websites that use the same password, but until Choi or someone can be certain that the database is secure again, don't use the same password on LbNA that you would use on other websites. <br/><br/>The file I saw included everyone's trail name, email address, last IP address, and password (in plain text), but that was it.<br/><br/>-- Ryan</p></body></html>
