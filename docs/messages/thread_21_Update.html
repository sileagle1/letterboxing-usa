This is a model.  Please have a look.  I'm sorry I'm changing<br/>
things so frequently.  I'm learning as I go.  The separation<br/>
on your screen on the new page is called a frame.  The upper<br/>
part stays there the whole time so you can always refer back<br/>
to the main areas no matter where you're at.  The list thingy<br/>
I would have had to copy onto every page and then I would have<br/>
had to update all of them every time it changed.  This is much<br/>
better!<br/>

<br/>
I had to change the location of my letterbox.  I didn't want to do it, but I<br/>
had to.  Dan'l suggested I changed it due to lack of interest, etc.<br/>
(privately), well, not exactly.  Frankly, I thought I saw a rat down by my box<br/>
the other day when I was visiting it, and I just can't stand the thought of<br/>
having an out-of-towner seeing rats in Evanston.  Besides, I HATE rats.  Can't<br/>
stand them.  I really liked the old location, but I had to change it.  (I'll<br/>
try not to change again, I really view it as bad letterboxing practice to be<br/>
moving your box).<br/>
<br/>
So here's the new clue...<br/>
It's better anyways...<br/>
Ready...<br/>
Here goes...<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------<br/>
Go to Dempster and Lake Shore Blvd. (one block East of Forest).  Turn left and<br/>
park.<br/>
Follow the large wall to the 28th cement parking block.<br/>
Do 17 jumping jacks while looking at the Lake.<br/>
It's 3 feet behind you.<br/>
---------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Isn't it AWESOME???  Actually, no, it's  not.  Too easy, and the location kind<br/>
of sucks, I think.  BUT there is a method to my madness.  You stamp my book at<br/>
that location, and IN THE BOX is a map to the box's stamp for your book.  And<br/>
believe you me, that is MUCH harder.  Ah Hah.  The map's in the box, but I'll<br/>
place the stamp by the end of the week.  (and I know you were all about to<br/>
rush out to it, too, right?)  Now that, my friends, is what we call cool.  I'm<br/>
so excited.  Can't wait for someone to visit it-hint,hint.<br/>
<br/>
Rachel.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.-I'll be visiting the Madison box(es, perhaps) in Dec. I think.<br/>
P.P.S.-Thanks Dan'l (he knows what I mean).<br/>

<br/>
Now that I have settled into my dorm, I have been able to actually <br/>
make the stamps. Each box will contain 2 stamps. Together, these <br/>
stamps portray the scene of one of the wackiest holidays that I have <br/>
ever heard of. You can guess if you want but the only clue that I <br/>
will give is that this holiday is in August. By chance, this was <br/>
around the day that I first got the idea for these boxes. I expect to <br/>
have these boxes mailed out to their respective destinations by <br/>
Wednesday, September 8th. Postage should cost no more than $3.00. Any <br/>
questions can be posted on the list or sent directly to me.<br/>
<br/>
Happy and safe boxing!<br/>

&gt; I'm sending you a partial copy of one of the discussions<br/>
&gt; taking place(not my post, but I'm trying not to identify<br/>
&gt; others without permission).  The statement that was<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; UH-OH!  ..  I just looked at the Missouri State<br/>
&gt; Park policy and they lump<br/>
&gt; geocaching &amp; letterboxing together, including this<br/>
&gt; statement that you are<br/>
&gt; supposed to  include in your cache/box:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ...  It is part of a worldwide game. You have found a<br/>
&gt; Geocaching or<br/>
&gt; Letterbox site. These<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; games basically involve a player to hide a "treasure" (this<br/>
&gt; container and<br/>
&gt; its contents) and<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; publish the exact coordinates or directional clues on the<br/>
&gt; appropriate Web<br/>
&gt; page so users can<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; go on a "treasure hunt" to find it. The only rules are: if<br/>
&gt; you take<br/>
&gt; something from the cache,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; you must leave something for the cache, and you must log<br/>
&gt; your visit in the<br/>
&gt; logbook. Hopefully, the person that hid this container<br/>
&gt; found a good spot<br/>
&gt; that is not easily found by uninterested parties.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes, a good spot<br/>
&gt; turns out to be a bad spot, though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IF YOU FOUND THIS CONTAINER BY ACCIDENT:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Great! You are welcome to join us! We ask only that you:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; . Please do not move or vandalize the container. The real<br/>
&gt; treasure is just<br/>
&gt; finding the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; container and sharing your thoughts with everyone else who<br/>
&gt; finds it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; . If you wish, go ahead and take something. But please also<br/>
&gt; leave something<br/>
&gt; of your<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; own for others to find, and write it in the logbook.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It seems to me that this is an open invitation to remove a<br/>
&gt; stamp from a<br/>
&gt; letterbox.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello Irish,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Perhaps I'm missing something here but I'm not clear<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; what you are referring to as far as a notice that is<br/>
&gt; &gt; supposed to be placed inside your boxes?  We have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; requirement that the Special Use Permit number be on<br/>
&gt; or in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the container, whether it be a geocache or a<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox.  This is how a Conservation Agent would<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; able to tell if the container was "legal" meaning that<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Special Use Permit had been obtained and was valid.<br/>
&gt; Anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; obtaining a special use permit for anything in our<br/>
&gt; agency<br/>
&gt; &gt; must somehow have either the permit displayed (for<br/>
&gt; instance<br/>
&gt; &gt; if they were using a picnic shelter) or have the<br/>
&gt; permit<br/>
&gt; &gt; number displayed, as valid proof of permission having<br/>
&gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; granted for that activity.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We understand that clues lead people directly to the<br/>
&gt; box<br/>
&gt; &gt; and that the area around the container is generally<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; disturbed as it might be from people searching for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; geocache.  Our permit system would not involve<br/>
&gt; anything<br/>
&gt; &gt; being added to or removed from the letterbox.  The<br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; &gt; issue that might arise from geocaching or letterboxing<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; be a well-worn path being created from point A to<br/>
&gt; point B,<br/>
&gt; &gt; at which point after the permit expires a manager<br/>
&gt; might<br/>
&gt; &gt; request that the location be changed.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Am I missing something?  I am not clear on what is<br/>
&gt; &gt; causing the upset reactions.  I can tell by looking<br/>
&gt; &gt; online that there appear to be many letterboxes on<br/>
&gt; MDC<br/>
&gt; &gt; property.  However, some of them may not be in<br/>
&gt; &gt; appropriate locations.  Area managers will work with<br/>
&gt; &gt; folks to agree on locations that will not interfere<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; other area users or with the primary activities for<br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt; &gt; our conservation areas are managed.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Ms. Kight,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thank you ever so much for your effort to reach the<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing community.  We often have nasty<br/>
&gt; encounters<br/>
&gt; &gt; with officials who don't understand our hobby. How<br/>
&gt; nice to<br/>
&gt; &gt; have someone reach out in such a pleasant way!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Your letter was shared with one of our listserv<br/>
&gt; &gt; opportunities.  Unfortunately, many of us are having<br/>
&gt; &gt; upset reactions after researching further on the<br/>
&gt; state<br/>
&gt; &gt; website.  Applying for permits isn't the problem.<br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt; &gt; problem is that whomever wrote the notice that is<br/>
&gt; supposed<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be placed inside our boxes, doesn't understand our<br/>
&gt; &gt; hobby.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We strongly support 'leave no trace' behaviors in our<br/>
&gt; &gt; self-identified community and believe firmly in<br/>
&gt; keeping our<br/>
&gt; &gt; clues so specific that there is no need to disturb<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; placement area fruitlessly searching. Geocaching is<br/>
&gt; _very_<br/>
&gt; &gt; different from letterboxing in one particularly<br/>
&gt; important<br/>
&gt; &gt; factor: Letterboxers take/leave nothing but an image<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; they visit a find. Geocachers 'swap' out swag from<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; caches. If someone swaps or takes an item from a<br/>
&gt; letterbox,<br/>
&gt; &gt; they have effectively destroyed that box. Losing the<br/>
&gt; stamp<br/>
&gt; &gt; removes a box from the game.  Losing the logbook<br/>
&gt; &gt; removes our history from the box.  Both are<br/>
&gt; essential<br/>
&gt; &gt; components.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If it would be possible to recognize the difference<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a separate statement made available for<br/>
&gt; letterboxes,<br/>
&gt; &gt; that would go a long way to soothe the fears of our<br/>
&gt; &gt; hobbyists. Perhaps you would know where to start in<br/>
&gt; &gt; contacting the appropriate person?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Your help is much appreciated and I hope you will join<br/>
&gt; us<br/>
&gt; &gt; on the trail at some point!<br/>
