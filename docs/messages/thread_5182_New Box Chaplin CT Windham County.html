<p>Fairy of the Falls</p></b><b>
<p>Placed: 4-27-02</p></b><b>
</b><p>Placed By: Chuck Straub and Molly</p>
<p>Location: Chaplin Connecticut, Windham County</p>
<p>Rated: Moderate</p><b>
<p>This box is actually easy to find but is rated moderate due to 
the terrain. There is a long uphill walk on a rocky trail. Although a beautiful 
series of many small falls, the beauty of this stream is not very well known 
even among people in this area. </p>
<p>Proceed north from the intersection of Route 6 and 198 in 
Chaplin. Travel down route 198 4 miles and take a right onto Morey Road. Upon 
entering Morey road, travel 5 tenths of a mile over a bridge crossing the 
Natchaug river to find a blue blazed tree on the left and right sides of the 
road. This is hard to see and not easy to find so look closely. You can park 
along side of the road. Not much traffic here. Walk over to the blue blazed 
Natchaug Trail on the left side of the road. Follow the blue blazed trail over a 
small stream on a two plank bridge. Continue on and keep following the blue 
blazed trail up along a rocky hill along a stream. On your way up the hill, you 
can view all the small waterfalls on the stream. When the local rivers and 
streams are running a bit high, you will see the best views of these mini falls. 
They continue all the way up the hill. On top of the hill the blue trail starts 
going away from the stream and then turns and comes back to it. You will come to 
a wooden bridge built as part of an Eagle Scout project in 1991 by Jeremy Lucas 
Troop 1033. Standing on the first board of the bridge, go 120 degrees 19 steps 
to the east side of 3 trees growing from one base. Under some rocks you will 
find the Letterbox. </p></b>
