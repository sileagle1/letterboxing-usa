What constitutes Easy?  Yesterday I went looking for a letterbox <br/>
that was classified as "Easy".  I walked almost a mile upa and down <br/>
hills deciphering the clues which were somewhat cryptic, and then <br/>
when I got to what I thought was the end, the box wasn't there.  Of <br/>
course I'll correspond with the placer, but I just wondered what <br/>
most everyone thinks is "easy".  I'm new to the hobby, but I've <br/>
found 5 boxes.  Of the 5, all but 1 were within a quarter mile or <br/>
so; one was only a few feet; the longest was about a mile and a half <br/>
round trip on flat ground.  All of those had pretty explicit clues.  <br/>
The one that I DIDN'T find with the hard clues over a mile up and <br/>
down hills I would hardly classify as "easy".<br/>
<br/>
Are there any "rules" for classifying a box?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering, <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
There is really no accepted set of guidelines for classifying box<br/>
difficulty. This is not to say that people have not tried: <br/>
<br/>
Take for instance this one on Silent Doug's site:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/rating/<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps the Mapsurfer:<br/>
http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/mrating.html<br/>
<br/>
Then there's Poison Ivy:<br/>
http://poisonivyrules.blogspot.com/<br/>
(okay, that's a bit different)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that the difficulty of a letterbox depends on a wide<br/>
variety of factors, like distance, steepness, altitude, clue<br/>
difficulty (the hike might be twice as long as necessary if the clue<br/>
is vague), weather, and so forth. Determining the relative<br/>
contribution of each factor is highly subjective. <br/>
<br/>
Plus, the difficulty of boxes varies greatly by region. A hard box in<br/>
Connecticut might be more like a medium box in Colorado. So a box<br/>
rating system would have to take into account the relative difficulty<br/>
of other boxes in the same area. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, letterboxer placers are a cantankerous bunch, so getting them<br/>
to agree to a particular rating system, or even include any rating at<br/>
all can be a challenging endeavor. Your best bet is to read through<br/>
the clue to try to get a feel for how long the hike is, do some<br/>
research on the area to decide what the terrain is like, then make an<br/>
informed decision, which could include choosing not to look for a box<br/>
that _might_ be out of your league.<br/>
<br/>
If in doubt, you could also contact the box placer and ask about<br/>
distance, terrain, etc. Most will answer your questions if you ask<br/>
nicely. <br/>

<br/>
All boxes are easy, unless otherwise noted by someone else. =)<br/>
<br/>
Unless it's a MapSurfer box then the clue will be devilishly tricky,<br/>
but quite possibily labeled as "moderate". ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Or one of my boxes, in which case I'll label it as "moderate", but<br/>
most people think it's a crime to call it anything less than "impossible".<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, there is no standard definition of what is "easy." You<br/>
know the saying about one man's trash being another man's treasure.<br/>
It's like that with rating the difficulty of a box. One man's easy is<br/>
another man's impossible. Best bet: ignore any indicates of easy,<br/>
moderate or hard and look for more objective measures such as<br/>
elevation gain or how long the trail is. And if that information isn't<br/>
in the clue, look it up yourself on the Internet, in a guide book, or<br/>
on a map. When it comes right down to it, you have a better idea of<br/>
your abilities than anyone else in the world and it's up to you to<br/>
decide if a box is easy, moderate, or difficult--NOT the person who<br/>
planted the letterbox.<br/>
