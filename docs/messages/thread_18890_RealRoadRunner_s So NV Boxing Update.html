too hot here in Southern Nevada to even think about going hiking. <br/>
<br/>
We found Ryan's Petroglyph Series #1 with no problem.  The log book is full up.  We have <br/>
to remember to start packing extra logs with us so we can help out in this situation.<br/>
<br/>
Petroglyph #2 is verified missing.  Don and Gwen's Rock Art aka Petroglyph Series #3, is in <br/>
great shape.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we went to the Cabins and picked up Pony Express.  Again, the log book for this <br/>
microbox is at capacity.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven't been out to this state park in a long, long time so it was wonderful to visit.  I was <br/>
glad to see new letterboxers Gronilot and crew had already visited.  There's a couple new <br/>
reasons to visit this site...hope top hear from you when you do.<br/>
<br/>
I will be planting more of the Johnny West Series in the next couple of weeks...stay tuned.<br/>
