Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
     My name is Madeline Gere.  I am a Smithsonian Associate, and own <br/>
a <br/>
small art gallery in Nashville.  Folk art is my passion and area of <br/>
expertise.   I am thrilled to have been made aware of this new genre <br/>
of <br/>
self taught art.  Many of you may be thrilled to know that the <br/>
Institution sees what you are doing as an important new folk art <br/>
movement.  We are interested in collecting and preserving some of the <br/>
art and artifacts from this nascent period of American letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
     Next month will be the five year anniversary of our magazine's <br/>
article on letterboxing in Dartmoor, England.  A few months ago, we <br/>
became aware that the article had precipitated an American version of <br/>
letterboxing.  As you know, we contacted one of your members, who <br/>
goes <br/>
by the name Legerdemaine, and the Smithsonian letterbox project was <br/>
initiated.  Legerdemaine brought some of his work to the Smithsonian <br/>
and showed it to us, and encouraged us to make a broader collection <br/>
of <br/>
the works being done.  I'm pleased to say that we have decided to do <br/>
this.  I have been asked by the curator to oversee this collection <br/>
process.  <br/>
<br/>
     I have spent some time perusing the Letterboxing.org website, as <br/>
well as other letterboxing websites affiliated with the Letterboxing <br/>
Web Ring.  I am excited by the vitality and breadth of your growing <br/>
community.  I'd like to work with this group to identify, collect, <br/>
and <br/>
preserve a good cross representation of the work being done.  At this <br/>
time, the Institution has no plans for a display of this material, <br/>
but <br/>
this may well happen at some time in the future.  We feel that it <br/>
would <br/>
be expedient to collect and preserve this work before it disappears.  <br/>
Subsequent additions to our collection may be made as time goes on.<br/>
<br/>
    The first step in the process is to identify the important work <br/>
that has been done to date.  I'd like the help of this community in <br/>
doing this, as it will be impossible for me to evaluate several <br/>
thousand  letterboxes.  Could you work together to come up with a <br/>
list <br/>
of fifty to one hundred of your best works?  The best fifteen to <br/>
twenty <br/>
from these will be selected to include in our collection.   The <br/>
emphasis of the collection is on physical items that can be <br/>
displayed, <br/>
so we are most interested in the stamp artwork, journal, and <br/>
container.  The clues will have less weight, but artful clues are <br/>
part <br/>
of the ideal package.  Please do not include stamps that do not have <br/>
original artwork (from a source such as clip art) even if they are <br/>
well <br/>
executed. All items donated will become property of the Institution, <br/>
so <br/>
please include only those items which people are willing to donate.  <br/>
<br/>
      I look forward to working with this group to collect and <br/>
preserve <br/>
its heritage.  Unfortunately, I do not have time to correspond <br/>
directly <br/>
with all the members of a group this size.  I've never worked with an <br/>
internet based group such as this before (nor one so large), and I'd <br/>
like to proceed by having the group self-identify what it believes to <br/>
be a representation of its best work for the Institution to make a <br/>
final selection from.   We would like for this collection to be a <br/>
broad <br/>
representation, and therefore we will not include more than three <br/>
works <br/>
by any individual in our final selection.<br/>
<br/>
     Finally, I'm sure that most of you are aware by now that the <br/>
letterbox set up for us in the Castle by Legerdemaine has <br/>
unfortunately <br/>
disappeared.  As much as we were enamored with this concept, it is <br/>
apparent that such a letterbox cannot be safeguarded.  Given our <br/>
connection with this activity, and the popularity of this letterbox, <br/>
we <br/>
would like to have an official letterbox for visitors to stamp in. It <br/>
will now be kept behind the information desk and will be available to <br/>
those who know to ask for it, but it will not leave the information <br/>
desk.  It will not be part of the collection.  We have asked <br/>
Legerdemaine to make another one, but he has suggested  that we <br/>
should <br/>
have a design competition to allow everyone to have a chance at it.  <br/>
I <br/>
have decided to leave this in up to you, and Legerdemaine has agreed <br/>
to <br/>
coordinate the contest and supervise the selection of an official <br/>
stamp <br/>
from within the group.<br/>
<br/>
     I look forward to working with you and learning about your art.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cordially, <br/>
<br/>

     Sarah from Appledumpling Gang has by far the best carvings and <br/>
elegant logbooks in the mid-atlantic. I don't know how you plan on <br/>
judging but please do consider her work.<br/>
     Looks like we get to go back to the Smithsonian and do another <br/>
stamp. It won't be the same because I felt like a spy the last go <br/>

<br/>
A logistically difficult undertaking.<br/>
<br/>
One way to handle it is for prospective donors to upload their work<br/>
to the "Files" area.  If there are more than 100 submissions, then perhaps<br/>
the group can vote.  (It appears people can't be "nominated"; the <br/>
artists must promote their work themselves).<br/>
<br/>
I have created a folder called "Smithsonian" for this purpose in the <br/>
Files area.  My suggestion is for people who want their boxes considered<br/>
to submit pictures or scans of them there.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there may be a better way to handle this.  Since none of<br/>
my work will be in the running, I have no stake in it -- I just figured<br/>
I'd take a stab at the logistical problem.  Feel free to offer alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
(I estimate there is space for at least 200 stamp scans, without deleting<br/>
anything, and without moving stamps from some of the other folders.  If<br/>
you need _pictures_ (for unique journals or containers), then perhaps<br/>
including an off-site url in that folder will make more sense).<br/>
<br/>
