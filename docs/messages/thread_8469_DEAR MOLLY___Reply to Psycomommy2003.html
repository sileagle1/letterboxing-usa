Hi, It gets even better, when I do meet other letterboxers, They <br/>
say, "oh, you;re Chuck and Molly" even if Molly isn't there. Molly is <br/>
my main hiking partner so when I got into letterboxing about 11 <br/>
months ago she became my main letterboxing partner. My wife, <br/>
Chickabirdie has lately been getting more into letterboxing but not <br/>
the real long or tougher hikes. So you now start to find all 3 of our <br/>
stamps in the same book. She is the one that put my web site together <br/>
for me. I just give her the content. There are a few pictures of <br/>
Chickabirdie and Myself on the site , but Molly gets a page. Thats my <br/>
buddy.....Chuck<br/>
