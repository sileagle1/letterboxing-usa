&gt; Silvercreek Trail Letterbox<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In Guelph, Ontario. From the 401 take either exit 299 (Brock Rd 46) <br/>
<br/>
&gt; or exit 295 (Hanlon Hwy 6). From Edinburgh Road (north/south)and <br/>
&gt; College Ave (east/west). Drive north on Edinburgh. From Edinburgh <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; Wellington. Drive south a few yards to the parking areas. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3 parking options. <br/>
&gt; Driving north on Edinburgh, just before the pedestrian lights: <br/>
&gt; Option 1) turn right into the park. <br/>
&gt; Option 2) turn left onto Manor Park Crescent <br/>
&gt; Option 3) drive over the Speed River, turn right into park just <br/>
before <br/>
&gt; Wellington Road. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The letterbox is 350m from the first parking lot listed above.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the parking lot take the path to Edinburgh Road. Walk SW along <br/>
&gt; the river with the river to your right. Cross at the pedestrian <br/>
&gt; lights. Continue along the path with the Speed River to your right <br/>
&gt; until you get to a small patch of asphalt over a bulrush-lined <br/>
ditch. <br/>
&gt; Stop here. Look left (South). You should see a birdhouse. Walk to <br/>
it. <br/>
&gt; From the birdhouse walk SE 140 degrees for 17 paces toward a large <br/>
&gt; pine with another small young pine very close to it. The LB is under <br/>
&gt; the opposite side of the tree. Please return it to the same spot and <br/>
&gt; cover it well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please leave everything in the letterbox, do not trade out.  Stamp <br/>
our <br/>
&gt; logbook with your stamp and stamp your logbook with the Silvercreek <br/>
&gt; Trail  letterbox stamp.<br/>
