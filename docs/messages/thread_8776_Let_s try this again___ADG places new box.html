After locating Mary Jane Rathburn's Find in Firefly's Maryland, My <br/>
Maryland series, take a right onto the purple and white blazed <br/>
trail.  As you take this right onto the trail, start counting the <br/>
blazes and count the blaze at your turn as number one.  At the fourth <br/>
blaze, take a bearing of 355 and eyeball the cave with the curved <br/>
tree at its entrance.  Proceed across the field and up the hill to <br/>
the entrance of the cave of Caerbannog.  (thank you Tempusfugitmd for <br/>
the name and correct spelling)  Be very quiet while retrieving this <br/>
box as beyond the cave lives a foul creature, a great huge monster <br/>
with big nasty teeth.  Don't be fooled by the white fluffy tail, this <br/>
vile creature will bite your kneecaps off.  While peering into the <br/>
opening, quaking with fear, make the rational decision and stay out <br/>
of the cave.  Instead, look to the left and find the flat rock <br/>
leaning up against another large rock.  The box is underneath the <br/>
flat rock beneath the international letterboxing symbol of neatly <br/>
arranged rocks and sticks.  Quickly pantomime remounting your horse <br/>
but do not begin banging your coconuts together until you are out of <br/>
earshot of the killer bunny.  Then take a moment to debate the load <br/>
bearing capacity of swallows.<br/>
