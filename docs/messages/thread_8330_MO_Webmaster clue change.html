<br/>
After my last conversation with the Rockwoods Reservation Rangers I have decided NOT to  turn this box into a a geocache combination.  Several of the geocachers in my area seem to bush wack straight to the coordinates and not take time to read the clues or warnings.  &lt;DISCLAIMER &gt; That doesn't go for all geocachers by any means just some in this area.  &lt;DISCLAIMER&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Could you please remove the red note about bringing a GPS from the Rockwood Reservation page?<br/>

As always be discrete when letterboxing. It is a good idea NOT to announce what you are doing to strangers. Some people get a kick out of tearing things up or keeping things for themselves. Be careful of the surrounding vegetation and be sure to put everything back...especially closing ziplocks carefully. For this box it wouldn't hurt to bring an extra freezer ziplock - just in case. For some reason the animals like to chew on notebook paper.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of room there...why not take a box with you to "plant" after you stamp up "Rock Woods."<br/>
<br/>
<b>If anyone brings their GPS, please send us the coordinates and I'll post them here. :o)<br/>
