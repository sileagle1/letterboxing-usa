&gt;  I have come up with a few from the LBNA map, but I was wondering whether <br/>
&gt; any of you could add to my list. I would like to pick up some letterboxes <br/>
&gt; along the way!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Denny Creek boxes near Seattle are all less than ten miles away from <br/>
the place the PCT crosses I-90 at Alpental.  (The only reason I know this, <br/>
in fact, is because I had an utter happyfreakout when I found the PCT <br/>
signs.  I'm sooooo jealous of the thru-hikers!  One of these days, this <br/>
letterboxer's going to just take off and GO GO GO, I tell you! :&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck on your thruhike!  Keep a journal, wouldja?  I need to live <br/>
vicariously. :)<br/>
