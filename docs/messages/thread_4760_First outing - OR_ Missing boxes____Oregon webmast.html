we had a great time. I'm 99% sure we found the right location<br/>
for both Greenway Park, and Fanno Creek letterboxes, but could<br/>
not locate either box. Will try another one next week.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The Willard's Elephant box of the zoo is also missing.  That box <br/>

<br/>
Fanno Creek was still there as of a month or two ago, and it's VERY <br/>
unlikely it's missing.  It's wedged in pretty deep and is tough to <br/>
reach even when you know it's there, so it's understandable if you <br/>
missed it.  If you go back, reach REALLY deep.  As far as your arm <br/>
will stretch.  It's there.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on other boxes!  It must have been frustrating hunting your <br/>
first boxes and not finding either of them.  Most of the other boxes <br/>
in the Beaverton area are still there.  Several of the Tualitin Hills <br/>
Nature Park series is missing.  A couple of the Rick's Farm series.  <br/>
And the first few of the Rock Creek Neighborhood series have a <br/>
tendency to go missing.  <br/>
<br/>
In any case, most of the boxes are there--just some of the series is <br/>
missing.  And just because it's there doesn't mean it's in a tricky <br/>
spot that's hard to reach or find!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
