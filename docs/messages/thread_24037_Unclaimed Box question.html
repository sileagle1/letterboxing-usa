http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=15619&amp;boxname=Smith's_Castle<br/>

The box is listed on LB.org as Unclaimed.  I assume that means that<br/>
somewhere along the way the placer has gotten lost.  In the clues it says<br/>
this box was hidden by Quilter.  I have contacted the person with that Trail<br/>
Name and she says it is not her box.<br/>
<br/>
We were not able to find the box.  The clues are simple and it was very<br/>
obvious where the box should have been.<br/>
<br/>
Given that it has a status of Unclaimed and the box appears to be missing, I<br/>
am willing to adopt this box.  Am I correct in my judgement of the<br/>
situation?  Am I correct that this box is adoptable?  And, how do I go about<br/>
the adoption?<br/>
<br/>
Any info appreciated!<br/>

You are correct. If a member deletes there membership when they have letterboxes, those boxes become owned by Unclaimed and may be adopted. Please make the request through the Contact the Webmasters link.<br/>

<br/>
The way the clues are written suggests that the box was placed there by the people who work at Smith's Castle.  I'd inquire by calling. It may actually have gone missing, or brought indoors "off-season."  Anyway, this box is right on the grounds and you would probably want their permission to replace it, anyway.  It's near a mass burial site. I found it and I thought that the box would not last long at all unless the staff kept close watch on it.  IIRC, it was at the base of the monument and very loosely covered with rocks so it could easily become exposed by visitors. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helped in some way.<br/>
