Forgot to cross post this yesterday....<br/>
<br/>
Patrick and Amy contacted us to mention that their computer is toast. <br/>
They're evaluating either getting it fixed and/or getting a new one. <br/>
Of course both are a bit pricey and its close to the holiday. If you <br/>
DO need to contact them; drop us a line and we'll arrange putting you <br/>
in touch with them somehow.<br/>

Happy Thanksgiving!<br/>
