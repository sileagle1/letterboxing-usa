                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to the Girl Guides for reporting Candy Cane City in Chevy <br/>
Chase, MD as being MIA. It is gone, and I removed the clues <br/>
from the website.<br/>
<br/>
Also gone now is Meadowbrook stables; I removed the clues <br/>
from the website previously as the stables are under <br/>
construction and the area indicated by the clues are off limits. I <br/>
was able to retrieve the box and may carve the back of the stamp <br/>
and hide it elsewhere as "Ghost Horse."<br/>
