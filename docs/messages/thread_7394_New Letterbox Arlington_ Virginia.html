<div>Drive all the way into the park and park near the bathrooms. Find a trail that starts near a billboard with information and a map of the park.  You are close to the Nature Center here, but you can't see it.  At the beginning of this trail, a sign says the Overlook has been removed.  Take this trail to where the Potomac Overlook used to be.  You will see another sign that says it has been removed.  At this sign, follow the trail to your right.  After you pass a trail that goes off to your left toward some houses, continue to the right until you reach a sharp left bend in the trail where trees roots make small steps in the trail. Count 80 paces (or steps) from these roots along the trail and stop.  There should be a large tree to your right just off the trail.  Behind this tree is an old rotted trunk that is about 10 feet tall.  Look behind and under some large pieces of bark.  Make sure it's hidden again when you leave. You can continue on this same trail and it will circle back to the trail you started on.  Good luck!   </div>
