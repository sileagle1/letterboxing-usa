I do not know what box in particular you are talking about, but as a general rule these are some of the things (questions I ask myself)I do to work on solving them:<br/>
<br/>
-does it list a county<br/>
-does it list a town<br/>
-are there misspellings (sometimes they are intentional)<br/>
-is there a play on words<br/>
-are some letters capitalized that should not be<br/>
-are there key words that can be googled<br/>
<br/>
sometimes in reading a mystery something jumps out at you, but generally you have to play around wit them and see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I helped you out a little.<br/>

This is in VT. we know th location as had passed ther many times and knew right where to go. <br/>
but jumbled letters (5) "(25)" can't make anything out of them, try as we may."Where Are We?" is the box and would love just a hint as to figuring it out, <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well,  mystery boxes are a bit harder to find because of the unknown location of them....  You need to interpret clues, search the internet, or perhaps really look at the wording for clues to where it might be.  Are you looking at angel1551us's mystery box?  Then you might convert the roman numerals to a standard number and then try that in a google search perhaps with some other words or clue ideas.....<br/>
