started a message board devoted to letterboxing:<br/>
<br/>
http://pub188.ezboard.com/bletterboxingnorthamerica<br/>
<br/>
On this board are forums for various areas of interest, including<br/>
general letterboxing information, new boxes, box reports by region,<br/>
and events, among others. Box reports and letterboxing stories are<br/>
welcome.  The forums allow you to read only areas that are interesting<br/>
to you, without having to wade through hundreds of messages. Also, the<br/>
message board format will allow for threaded topics, keeping related<br/>
messages together.  <br/>
<br/>
Getting the board going is a slow process.  While a number of people<br/>
have visited, a small (but growing) subset have posted.  I hope you<br/>
will try the board and make suggestions. I believe this could be a<br/>
major improvement in communication for the letterboxing community.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

Frog Dad,  <br/>
<br/>
May I be the FIRST one to congratulate you on your wonderful new LBNA <br/>
site.  It is put together well, easy to navigate and very <br/>
professional looking.  I will be visiting it every day, maybe even a <br/>
few times a day.  Ha ha.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A Job Well Done!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
:)<br/>
