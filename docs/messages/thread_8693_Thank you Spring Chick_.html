Thank you for all the letterboxes you have placed, especially the <br/>
ones in western Michigan. (Last time I counted you had placed 40 <br/>
letterboxes in Michigan and you started placing them in August 2002 I <br/>
believe! What are you averaging 17 letterboxes placed a month <br/>
including the ones you have placed out of state?) <br/>
<br/>
Your hand carved stamps are great and the locations you have picked <br/>
are wonderful. I love your latest logbooks, which are beautiful. Your <br/>
clues are creative and I enjoy the variety of styles you have used. <br/>
<br/>
I have had the pleasure looking for (and most of the time finding) <br/>
your letterboxes in the western Michigan area. My first letterbox <br/>
hunt was in August of this year and my first letterbox was Chinook <br/>
Pier, followed by Grand Haven Lighthouse. (Hey I noticed you moved <br/>
this one - if I find it again does it go in my found column <br/>
twice? ; ) Next were Seagull Shadows and Spirit of the Dunes. Of <br/>
course after the flush of those first finds came the box that has <br/>
stumped me after two separate outings, once in August and then again <br/>
in October  The Walk A Mile Letterbox or in my case "The<br/>
Walk Many <br/>
Miles" <br/>
<br/>
My next visit to Michigan found that you had been busy placing more <br/>
letterboxes. So with clues in hand I headed out for A Kind Of Summer <br/>
and Beautiful Things part of the Words in the Woods series you had <br/>
started planting. I returned to my home away from home in Michigan <br/>
only to find you had posted the remaining 6 boxes! Plans were quickly <br/>
made with my LB partner to return a few days later and find your <br/>
latest letterboxes. We found five of the remaining six  Common<br/>
Link, New Lands, Beauty of Dreams, See The Stars, and In Three Words <br/>
or in our case "In Three Tries" This is the one that slowed<br/>
us down <br/>
(well leaving all the clues at home and having to go back for <br/>
them did not help either!) but mostly it was a simple case of <br/>
misreading the directions and/or trying to force or make the <br/>
directions fit, one of us is very stubborn = ) and we ran out of time <br/>
and we weren't able to look for, For The Moment. = ( <br/>
<br/>
I will be back in November and I will be out there looking for Walk A <br/>
Mile and For The Moment and hopefully some of the other letterboxes <br/>
in the area, weather willing! (If you are out the same day on the <br/>
trails it will be easy to recognize me - I will be the one who is <br/>
bundled up in layers and layers of clothing when all the locals are <br/>
wearing t-shirts still!) <br/>
<br/>
Again thanks for all the work you have put into placing letterboxes. <br/>
I have enjoyed each and every search whether I have found the box <br/>
easily, ended up retracing my steps to find where I have gone astray <br/>
or even when I come up empty handed!<br/>

I don't think you get to count it again unless everything changes -- <br/>
stamp, clues, etc.  In this case, I just moved it to a more discreet <br/>
location because they had cut all of the brush on the backside of the <br/>
rocks there and it was visible from the parking lot if you looked in <br/>
the right spot.<br/>
<br/>
 Next were Seagull Shadows and Spirit of the Dunes. Of <br/>

&gt; Walk Many <br/>
&gt; Miles" <br/>
<br/>
Walk-A-Mile has been a tough one for a few others also, although it <br/>
has been found, which verified the clues... (I did make a couple of <br/>
modifications/clarifications from their feedback, so make sure you <br/>
print new clues).  Hopefully it won't be so elusive for you in <br/>
November.  E-mail me if there is anything you are unsure of...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I will be back in November and I will be out there looking for Walk <br/>
A <br/>
&gt; Mile and For The Moment and hopefully some of the other letterboxes <br/>

<br/>
You didn't mention if you had found the "Words in the Woods" Cuckoo <br/>
Clue (yes, there is a 9th box)...  I know which box I originally put <br/>
it in, but it may have been moved since then...  hopefully your <br/>
November trip will bring that your way too!  I was at Hofma Park the <br/>
day after you found some of the boxes and noticed that you had been <br/>
the lucky one to find the Backpacker HH!  That was cool...  hopefully <br/>
he will be headed for some new travels.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Again thanks for all the work you have put into placing <br/>

<br/>
It is nice to hear your feedback and I am glad you enjoyed finding <br/>
them all as much I have enjoyed putting them out!  I will look for <br/>
you on the trail next month...  would like to see an actual number <br/>
behind my "X" count!<br/>
<br/>
p.s.  Being a CA girl, and still adjusting to the MI cold, I don't <br/>
imagine you guys will be heading up into the U.P. any time soon, but <br/>
if you do...  there are some really fun ones up there too!<br/>

<br/>
I was just kidding about counting that one box twice  besides<br/>
how am I ever going to find all your new boxes if I go looking for <br/>
those I have already found What is it they say? So many<br/>
boxes so little time<br/>
<br/>
Re Walk-A-Mile;<br/>
<br/>
I am determined to find Walk-A-Mile... I will check the clues to see <br/>
if I have the latest one with the modifications!  <br/>
<br/>
Re Cuckoo Clue and The Backpacker HH;<br/>
<br/>
No we did not find the Cuckoo Clue. If it was in a box that we found <br/>
we did not notice it. Could we have overlooked it? I am not sure what <br/>
exactly we would be looking for... Maybe in November...<br/>
<br/>
Yes I was with the person who has the Backpacker HH... last I heard <br/>
he was still hanging out in Michigan... but I heard a rumor that he <br/>
enjoyed my tales of the wonderful weather in Southern California so <br/>
much he is thinking of heading out this way for the winter! He has <br/>
after all spent nearly two years on the east coast... I think he is <br/>
hearing that age old call "Go West Young Man! Go West!"<br/>
<br/>
Re crossing paths along the trail;<br/>
<br/>
Yes it would be fun to see you on the trail and then I would have my <br/>
first X too!<br/>
<br/>
Re The U.P.<br/>
<br/>
Yes my blood is a little thin being a CA girl. I am becoming well <br/>
acquainted with Polartec, Silkies, flannel lined jeans and hats, <br/>
gloves that actually serve a purpose (i.e. keeping you warm!) not <br/>
just as an accessory. The farthest North I have made it in MI is <br/>
Mackinac Island and that was a few years ago in October. It is <br/>
beautiful up there but time not the weather has kept me from going <br/>
back up north... hopefully in the spring... I would love to go <br/>
camping - letterboxing my way up to the U.P. - and then come back by <br/>
way of Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana. I love road trips, no <br/>
surprise growing up in California and I also love camping but I don't <br/>
think I am ready for snow camping any time soon... Learning to drive <br/>
in the snow is daunting enough thought for me right now!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>
