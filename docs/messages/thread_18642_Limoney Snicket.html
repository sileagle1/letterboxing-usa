so profound, we nearly forgot our stamp pads as we rushed to their aid way up <br/>
at that tall bridge. And, oh, it was a beautiful May Day! But, alas, as you <br/>
noted, the worst news comes on beautiful days.<br/>
<br/>
We hunted up (while looking down) we hunted down (while looking up) scoured <br/>
north and south (AND east and west) for over 2 hours, yes! Yet nary a pipe nor <br/>
tree held any hint of our lost waifs. That dastardly Count Olaf!! Curse him.<br/>
<br/>
We are so very sorry we could not locate the little ones. Perhaps if we <br/>
encountered another dropped note or other morsel of a clue we would be able to go <br/>
to their aid.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, dear, dear ones. We'll find you, hang on !!!<br/>
