Hi!<br/>
I am a letterboxer in Georgia who is new to the pastime- I have found 5 letterboxes <br/>
so far. This is so much fun! My husband and I have both carved stamps, and we <br/>
usually hike with our baby (turning one year old this month!). I look forward to finding <br/>
(and placing) many letterboxes in the future.<br/>
<br/>
I am curious: how did you find out about letterboxing? In my case, I was browsing at <br/>
REI (an outdoor sports store) and found a book on letterboxing. The more I read, the <br/>
more excited I got! Could this be true? Were there really little boxes with hand carved <br/>
stamps hidden in secret spots outdoors all over North America (and elsewhere, of <br/>
course!)?? Too cool! I was immediately hooked. It's a perfect hobby for me.<br/>
<br/>
What about you?<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>

&gt; I am a letterboxer in Georgia ... how did you find out about <br/>
&gt; letterboxing? In my case, I was browsing at REI (an outdoor sports<br/>
&gt; store)<br/>
<br/>
Wow!  Is that the one in Atlanta?  Because I think I purchased some<br/>
toilet paper for the AT there!  Small world, huh?  =)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I'm just joking.  I don't remember where I got the toilet paper,<br/>
but I did pick up fuel for my stove there (which I ditched after I<br/>
made the soda can stove) and a tarp that I carried the whole way.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, to answer your question....  I learned about letterboxing from a<br/>
small blurb, probably two inches long in length, in Backpacker<br/>
magazine over three years ago.  I was hooked the moment I read about<br/>
it!  Logged into letterboxing.org and spent the rest of the night<br/>
learning how to carve stamps and reading clues in the area.  I'd<br/>
probably be some loser with a job right now if it wasn't for<br/>
letterboxing.  ;o)<br/>

My family and I started about 2 years ago.  A colleague of my <br/>
husbands up in PEI, Canada told my husband about letterboxing.  We <br/>
went on the letterboxing.org website found a local one to search <br/>
for.  We told our kids (then 5, 5 and 2) that we were going <br/>
exploring like Dora the Explorer, and we've been boxing ever since.<br/>
