<br/>
<br/>
  Hey, I am new to this and I was wondering.  Is the only place to find <br/>
  out about letterboxes in your area at the letterboxing.org site?<br/>
<br/>
  That is the best place, but some folks do have some unpublished letterboxes in their areas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I saw it written about the booklets for the Cambridge ones.  I just <br/>
  wondered if there was anything like that for letterboxes in the U.S. <br/>
<br/>
  Not that I'm aware of.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Also, Do you report if the boxes is not found to anyone so that it <br/>
  can be "removed" from the sites if it has gone MIA? <br/>
<br/>
  You should report it , but how do you know is is MIA. Maybe you just couldn't find it.<br/>
<br/>
  Or is there some <br/>
  kind of rule to check on your own boxes every 6 months or anything <br/>
  like that?  <br/>
<br/>
  There are no rules! Sometimes people plant orphans.Most folks check on their boxes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I guess I am kind of wondering what the chances are that <br/>
  a box listed doesn't really exist.<br/>
<br/>
  If you are wondering about a specific LB you can request info on this list and sometimes you will get an answer.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks in advance for any answers to these questions!<br/>
