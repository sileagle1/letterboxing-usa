note in your clues if the area is handicapped accessible and/or pet <br/>
friendly.<br/>
<br/>
I run a greyhound adoption group, and encourage my folks to letterbox <br/>
too.  It's a really great thing to find boxes in areas where they can <br/>
go WITH their dogs-- it encourages family participation and all that <br/>
good stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Also, with a handicapped family member, there are precious few things <br/>
they can do from a wheelchair.  I realize it still takes someone with <br/>
them to get down and actually GET the box from it's hiding <br/>
place....but boxes that are placed in areas they can get too are <br/>
wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion if you guys haven't considered it.  :-)<br/>

System I created a few weeks ago and offer it once again to the Letterbox<br/>
Community.<br/>
<br/>
The generator and decoder are available at:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.myndworx.com/modules/LCAS/diff_gen.php for the generator<br/>
<br/>
http://www.myndworx.com/modules/LCAS/diff_decoder.php for the decoder<br/>
<br/>
It uses a letter system, much like the currently accepted 'PFX' count we<br/>
letterboxers use.  It covers just about anything you can think of in<br/>
describing the difficulty level of a given box, yet doesn't give anything<br/>
away. It has specific areas for Handicap, Stroller and Pet friendly, along<br/>
with clues, location, trail and accessibility.<br/>
<br/>
I encourage everyone to take a look at it and make use of it to rate your<br/>
own boxes with.  The interface is very easy to use and it creates a segment<br/>
of code you can paste on a webpage to create a link back to the decoder so<br/>
that people can instantly find out what your box is rated at.<br/>

My dear Mr. Haus,<br/>
<br/>
Lady Prisspott would like to take a moment to shamelessly point out <br/>
that immodesty and self-promotion are not flattering to one and <br/>
suggests, at best, a poor grasp of social graces. We must beg the <br/>
forgiveness of this vast audience, of course, for her Ladyship's <br/>
public admonition, which, as we have stated, is shameless, but <br/>
perhaps others are not dispossessed of similar sentiment. <br/>
<br/>
We are reminded of an earlier era in which social graces were more <br/>
important to ones standing and position in society and the words of <br/>
an English nobleman, the Earl of Roscommon who said; "Immodest words <br/>
admit of no defence, For want of decency is want of sense".<br/>
<br/>
Such quaint doggerel tripping easily off the tongue and delighting <br/>
the fancy of the enlightened intellect is effortlessly recalled and <br/>
provides a pleasantly received lesson that is well heeded by all. <br/>
Perhaps the Earl recalled the cunning words of Dear Mr. Shakespeare <br/>
who employed his prodigious wit in Falstaff to make a similar point <br/>
when he wrote:<br/>
<br/>
The Prince but studies his companions <br/>
Like a strange tongue, wherein, <br/>
to gain the language,<br/>
`Tis needful that the most immodest word<br/>
Be looked upon and learnt, which once attained,<br/>
Your highness knows, comes to no further use<br/>
But to be known and hated.<br/>
<br/>
With warmest regard and begging the most gracious indulgence of <br/>
those upon whos ears this unsolicited message has fallen,<br/>
Lady Prisspott<br/>
<br/>
