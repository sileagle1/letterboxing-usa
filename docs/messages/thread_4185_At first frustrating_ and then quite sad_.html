                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, my morning class was cancelled today so instead I went out in look of<br/>
the terrestrial gastropod. After a few wrong turns and forgetting my compass<br/>
in the car I ended up in the first boxes location. I couldn't find it. I<br/>
looked up, I looked down. I broke five different sticks before finding a<br/>
green one, soaked my feet trying every tree and cranny..... I didn't find<br/>
the first letterbox, but I did find someone's purse, wrapped in a clear<br/>
plastic bag. I poked at it many times with a stick, unsure if it was safe to<br/>
touch. Inside I only found a few other purses. (All of them were empty BTW)<br/>
<br/>
Dejected I went to find the second letterbox. I spent about an hour trying<br/>
to find the right "Trees of Three" I actually went into the forest from two<br/>
different trails, trying to find the right one. I don't know if I did, I<br/>
never found the second box. But, I did find the first. Sitting, out in the<br/>
open, next to a large grouping of cedars. It is currently sitting next to<br/>
me. Wet, empty, and very sad. The only way I even know its the first one is<br/>
that Beth and Mark were smart enough to secure a note to the lids container.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news. So, what should I do with the box? I<br/>
would be more then happy to hand it over to Beth and Mark, or return it to<br/>
its original hiding space. Whatever Beth and Mark (or the list if they don't<br/>
respond) feel is appropriate.<br/>
