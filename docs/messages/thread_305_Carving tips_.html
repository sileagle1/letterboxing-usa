As far as carving tools... I say WHATEVER COMES TO HAND THAT WORKS.  If<br/>
you use a blow torch, air ratchet and 3 bent bobby pins and your work<br/>
turns out as expected, you are ahead of the game &amp; moving towards<br/>
stardom.  For punching nice round holes, look for a Tandy leather<br/>
place... or similar &amp; get some leather punches.  They come in a bunch of<br/>
sizes and should do the trick.<br/>

have found a few uses for a needle with its head stuck into the end of a dowel<br/>
rod.  It can be used to prick out very fine details.<br/>
<br/>
Dan mentions having trouble removing little curved spots and holes.  The best<br/>
tip I have to offer here is to avoid the urge to keep the eraser motionless<br/>
while you maneuver the knife this way and that trying to whittle away the<br/>
pieces you don't want.  Instead, I prefer to to hold the knife still (at an<br/>
angle) and rotate the eraser around in my hand.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what kind of image you'd get by using a soldering iron on rubber,<br/>
but I can imagine what kind of SMELL you'd get... Yuck!!<br/>

I remember, many months ago, reading thru the Carving Consortium pages.<br/>
One stamp carver had found a way to get incredilby fine detail - she got<br/>
used drills from a dentist, and put the in a Dremel tool.I imagine other<br/>
things could be used in the Dremel - fine drill, wire brad, needle? I've<br/>
not tried this yet.<br/>

I find carving letters at an angle works best. If you carve an outward bevel from the letter, you can then carve another bevel inwards towards the level, creating a "v" that can easily be removed. This would also work for inside an "o". Your cuts don't have to be straight down. I use an Exacto knife as a carving tool.<br/>
<br/>
Another fun trick I have discovered is that you can offset some inks with fingernail polish remover. Print out our letters or image on your laser printer, face the print down on your eraser, then dab with a cloth soaked with polish remover. The image will transfer nicely to the eraser.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your carving. As with many things, I suspect it just takes practice.<br/>

PS I carved my first 3 stamps this weekend. The first one tooks hours! The second one took 30 minutes and the 3rd one took 20 minutes and looks pretty good!<br/>
