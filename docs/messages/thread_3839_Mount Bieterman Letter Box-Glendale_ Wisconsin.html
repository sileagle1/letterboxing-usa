Milwaukee County, Wisconsin<br/>
City of Glendale, Kletzsch Park<br/>
<br/>

first!)<br/>

Clues: Easy<br/>
Terrain: Easy, one hill, 30 minutes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This letter box has been placed in honor of Coach<br/>
Bernard Bieterman, teacher and cross country<br/>
running coach at nearby Nicolet High School. For<br/>
many years the Nicolet cross country athletes<br/>
trained in Kletzsch Park under his quiet but firm<br/>
and focused guidance. Coach Bieterman insisted<br/>
that training sessions regularly include "hill<br/>
work" on the largest hill in the park. During one<br/>
expecially challenging and character-building<br/>
session his runners unofficially christened the<br/>
hill, "Mount Bieterman" while doubled over,<br/>
gasping and hoping for recovery before the next<br/>
"hill repeat." In fact those hill training<br/>
sessions gave his team a significant competitive<br/>
advantage especially during home meets when the<br/>
course dictated that the runners make two ascents<br/>
of that very hill.<br/>
<br/>
Although Coach Bieterman probably never knew that<br/>
a "mountain" had been named in his honor, the<br/>
legend stands as a tribute and an expression of<br/>
gratitude from at least one of his former<br/>
athletes. His calm, honest and direct demeanor<br/>
created a supportive atmosphere that encouraged<br/>
his students to grow both in the classroom and the<br/>
athletic fields. More than two decades later this<br/>
tribute is gratefully placed by one of those<br/>
students and athletes who in fact is still running<br/>
for fitness and competition.<br/>
<br/>
Glendale is a community north of Milwaukee along<br/>
Interstate 43. Exit the interstate at the "Good<br/>
Hope Road" exit. At the end of the exit go east to<br/>
the first street, Port Washington Road and turn<br/>
right to continue Southward. At the next traffic<br/>
light, Green Tree Road, turn right and travel West<br/>
back across I-43. Immediately after crossing the<br/>
highway turn left onto Jean Nicolet Road. You'll<br/>
pass Nicolet High School on your right. Continue<br/>
for about a mile under a railroad bridge and turn<br/>
right (west) on Bender Road at the water treatment<br/>
plant. Follow Bender Road west across the<br/>
Milwaukee River, and turn Right (north) on<br/>
Milwaukee River Parkway. About a half mile later<br/>
after once again passing under the same railroad<br/>
tracks you'll come to the park pavillion on your<br/>
right. Mount Bieterman will be on your left<br/>
covered by evergreen trees. You'll find ample<br/>
parking in the area.<br/>
<br/>
To participate in this tribute and begin your<br/>
cross country challenge join the ranks of Coach's<br/>
runners and make an ascent of Mount Bieterman.<br/>
Upon your successful summit and while enjoying the<br/>
view consult your compass. From the summit travel<br/>
cross country on a bearing of 76 degrees. Your<br/>
course will take you across a road and past a<br/>
picnic area sign and then onward to a path into<br/>
the woods. Follow the path over painted roots and<br/>
past a stand of birch trees on your left. Continue<br/>
along the path as it curves to the left along the<br/>
top of a steep bank of the Milwaukee River being<br/>
careful not to fall over the edge. Stop at the<br/>
"Big V." (If you come to the end of the woods,<br/>
you've missed it; go back.) Consult your compass<br/>
once again and pace off approximately 60 steps on<br/>
a bearing of 290 degrees stepping over a log on<br/>
the way. You'll come to the trunk of  a large<br/>
standing tree. Check its opposite side, and you'll<br/>
find that it's hollow. Reach inside on your left.<br/>
Search deeply within yourself and the trunk to pay<br/>
tribute to a good man.<br/>
<br/>
After stamping up, please carefully return the box<br/>
to its hiding place and return to the "Big V."<br/>
Return by reversing your course on the woods path<br/>
or continue in your original direction to a road<br/>
that will take you back to the main road to the<br/>
left or to a large picnic area to the right. Feel<br/>
free to continue your hill work by performing<br/>
several more "hill repeats" on Mount Bieterman. If<br/>
you're not feeling athletic, enjoy a relaxing tour<br/>
of the park including the water fall in the river.<br/>
Perhaps a picnic lunch will be enjoyable. Thank<br/>
you for your visit. <br/>
<br/>
I'd appreciate email telling me of your visit and<br/>
the condition of the box.<br/>
