                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was out with friends on Saturday in a state park in New Jersey, and we <br/>
saw hunters in the area, and later heard gunshots in the distance. It was a <br/>
reminder that hunting season is now open in many states. It would be a good <br/>
idea now to exercise a bit of extra caution whenever you're out on the <br/>
trail. In many state parks and forests (not to mention state game lands), <br/>
hikers and hunters share areas around the trails, and you shouldn't entrust <br/>
your safety to the hunters.<br/>
<br/>
Before you head out on a trail, check to see if the surrounding area is <br/>
also used for hunting. (You can usually find this information on a state <br/>
park's web site.)<br/>
<br/>
A few states, such as PA and NJ, ban hunting on Sunday, so if you have a <br/>
choice of days, it might be better to choose Sunday rather than Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
It's always a good idea to wear blaze orange when you're out in the woods <br/>
at this time of year -- such as a hat, vest or jacket. Sure, it may not be <br/>
as fashionable as your favorite earth-tone togs, but it's definitely more <br/>
sensible.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is ABSOLUTELY the best posting I've read in a couple of days.  I <br/>
have friends who had a hiking/hunting mishap that ended very <br/>
tragically.  They were not letterboxing, and the hiker was wearing <br/>
orange, but as this post pointed out, you cannot always rely on the <br/>
hunters.  This particular hunter fired sight unseen and killed the <br/>
hiker.  PLEASE exercise caution especially when hiking with children <br/>
during the hunting season.  They are inquisitive, curious explorers <br/>
and may wander off while you're stamping in.  Thank you Silent Doug <br/>
for bringing this "important" reminder to the list.  Donna<br/>

<br/>
Technically true, but that could be a harmful over-generalization. Hunting <br/>
*is* permitted in some "National Recreation Areas"  and "National <br/>
Preserves" that are under the administration of the National Park Service. <br/>
These areas are often considered "national parks" in a general sense.<br/>
<br/>
Even so, since letterboxing is frowned upon by the NPS, you might not have <br/>
too many opportunities to find any!<br/>
