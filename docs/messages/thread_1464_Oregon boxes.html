                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got back in from my very first trip to the west coast.  I have a friend<br/>
who recently moved to Portland, so I decided to pay a visit.  We searched out<br/>
some boxes while I was there, and I have some to report missing.  Ponytail<br/>
Falls is definately not there.  There was a note in it's place, that read "You<br/>
are in the right spot, but the box was stolen".  Also, we believe, umm, the<br/>
last of the series, I don't remember the name :) , is also missing.  Triple<br/>
Falls had a school group visit that one, by far the most visits out of all of<br/>
them.  <br/>
The only other ones we attempted were the Rock Creek series, and number one<br/>
and three are missing.  We didn't attempt Bronson Creek.  I enjoyed the Troll<br/>
and Dragon, those were cute ideas :)  We were the first to visit the Troll!<br/>
Wahoo!<br/>
Needless to say, I have convinced my friend to place a few.  I think he was<br/>
just as enthused as me in searching for them.  So there should be new boxes to<br/>
search for out there soon!<br/>
I was thinking that you guys sure could pick beautiful places to hide your<br/>
boxes, but then I realized the whole state is like that.  It was an amazing<br/>
trip, nothing here really compares (not meaning to start a debate or anything<br/>
:) ). <br/>

My #1 Rock Creek has a weird history of appearing and disappearing. <br/>
Apparently it is currently in a missing mode.  I'll have to walk over<br/>
and take a look.  As you walked along the "lake," you could have waved<br/>
to me.  My home is across the field from the path along the lake!<br/>

ssshhhh... quiet about that.  We don't advertise the scenery much. <br/>
Everyone believes the grey and rainy (which it really is today!) story.<br/>
