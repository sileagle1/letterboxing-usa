<br/>
Went out last week and did the Mother Hubbard letterboxes. Bonnie did <br/>
a wonderful job carving the stamps! She's a very talented person. I <br/>
hate to report that the Milk Bone stamp was broken in half. I was <br/>
still able to get a good stamp by putting both halves together. <br/>
Someone prior to me did make a note in the log book about the stamp <br/>
being broken but I don't recall seeing anything posted to let you <br/>
know. Sorry to give you this bad news.<br/>
