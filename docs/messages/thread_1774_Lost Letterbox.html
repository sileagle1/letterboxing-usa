<div>Am sad to report that the Captain's Walk letterbox in Mystic is gone. Not

Since Captain's Walk is one of our favorites, I ran out after work to <br/>
check on it. Sorry to tell you we stumped you, but happy to report <br/>
that the letterbox is just fine. There were even a couple of <br/>
footprints in the snow indicating maybe someone else was checking on <br/>
it (Melissa &amp; Dan perhaps?). So if you're ever back in the area, <br/>
please try again!<br/>

I trust that we were on the correct Captain's Walk???? perhaps the flowerpot<br/>
is much more to the rear of the bench then we looked?  Anyway great site we<br/>
saw two swans while there and the other site in Mystic was wonderful ---<br/>
thanks for your attentiveness and great passion for letterboxing.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
