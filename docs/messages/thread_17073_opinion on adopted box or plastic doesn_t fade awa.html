compost. As 'Cock o' the Trail' noted, an unmaintained box is close <br/>
to becoming litter. Once the clues are gone the box cannnot be <br/>
found, the box has no useful purpose, so it does become litter.<br/>
<br/>
If the group doesn't want to have these maintained, perhaps the <br/>
group should ask for volunteers to pick up the litter?<br/>

Just thinking out loud.<br/>

&gt; You do well to seek input here, Loraxe, as we still lack generally <br/>
&gt; accepted policy or guidelines.  How did you come by the clues?  Is <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; still listed, tho unclaimed, or not? When was it last visited? Is <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; placer known, and has there been an attempt to contact him/her? <br/>
All <br/>
&gt; of these need to be considered.  If the box was placed more than a <br/>
&gt; year ago and shows no sign of maintenance, it is dangerously close <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; becoming 'litter'.  <br/>
&gt; But to answer your question . . . no, I don't think you should <br/>
&gt; replace the stamp, rewrite the clues, or even adopt the box, <br/>
unasked. <br/>
&gt; There's been a lot of controversy about that recently. It's better <br/>
&gt; that it be allowed to fade away.  Just my opinion . . . <br/>
