I am pregnant, so I can be excused for having crazy dreams....but<br/>
lately I have been having some funny ones concerning letterboxing. One<br/>
dreams involves a mysterious stranger calling me on the phone and<br/>
telling me to go search the Acadia National Park Visitor's Center. I<br/>
do and there, along the steps leading to the building, I spy a small<br/>
pile of stones and sticks. I wipe them away and find the box! I never<br/>
open it up to see the stamp or logbook (I don't know if I have reached<br/>
that level of obsession yet...it will come soon I am sure!)<br/>
<br/>
My question is: do I add this to my F count? Maybe I should have a<br/>
logbook in my dream and have subconscious dream stats too!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

This is very timely!  I am not pregnant so I cannot be excused for my crazy letterboxing <br/>
dream earlier this week. "I hopped out of my car when I spied a letterbox.  As I approached <br/>
the hiding spot, I stopped and could not go any further.  There was someone in the <br/>
distance rummaging through the reeds getting something.  I said, 'drats, I can't go for this <br/>
one, because he will see me and come and take away the letterbox.'  The urge to pull the <br/>
box was soo strong, but I didn't want to commit the letterboxing no-no of being found <br/>
out.  I resigned myself to the fact that I could not have this box at the cost of losing it <br/>
forever to other visitors."<br/>
<br/>
Now, if that isn't the most vivid dream I've had AND remembered the next day ... I am <br/>
already going crazy for warmer and drier weather.  Hello, my name is speedsquare.  I have <br/>
been letterboxing for 8 months and I have a problem.<br/>

Maybe I will become a dream placer too and you will have more boxes to<br/>
choose from if you ever find yourself in the same dream situation again!<br/>

I think I'll try to find a spot near reeds next summer!  The box will be titled "Only In My <br/>
Dreams."  It's good to have friends who understand.<br/>

about letterboxing a lot, i'm already up to 5!  I've only been <br/>

PS. I found another box today (real, not virtual or imagined).  It was flurrying snow all the <br/>
way to the location.  Once I found the box, the snow subsided long enough to get the <br/>
stamp without messing up.  Rehid the box and then the snow started up again.  Is there a <br/>
name for this heavenly letterboxing spirit?<br/>

That's an interesting idea for an eXtreme letterbox!  =)  I know we<br/>
normally don't get permission before hiding a letterbox, but I think<br/>
in this case it might be a good idea.  So?  Did you get permission in<br/>
your dream?  ;o)<br/>

LOL. No permission, I think the house was abandoned or something.  <br/>
I thought of you recently Ryan...when my husband and I were in Hawaii <br/>
for Thanksgiving, we went snorkeling out around this point, and he <br/>
said that up in the rocks would be a good place to hide a lb...and <br/>
people would have to swim or boat out to get it.  From what I hear <br/>
of  your boxes (never hunted one before) it sounded like something <br/>
you would do.<br/>

Yeah, that does sound like something I would do.  =)  I'd love to hide<br/>
a box that required getting over (or through!) a body of water to<br/>
acquire!  Especially if the water is perfect for snorkling in.  Seems<br/>
criminal NOT to hike a box in such a location when you can!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Sheeze, first planted boxes on people's roofs without permission, and<br/>
now not planting them that requires a swim or a boat to get to. <br/>
*shaking head*  Where will the disappointments end?!  =)<br/>
