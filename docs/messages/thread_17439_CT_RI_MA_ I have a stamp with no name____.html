                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK.... My New Year's resolution was to clean all of the physical clutter from <br/>
my life.  So... I decided to tackle my desk in my home office today.  I found <br/>
a piece of paper with a letterboxing stamp on it, but forgot to add it to my <br/>
logbook.  Its a blue cloud with a face in it, that is crying rain.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone recognize the stamp?  If so, would you be willing to let me know <br/>
the box that it belongs to?  Once I find out, I'll attempt to refind the box <br/>
in order to figure out when I was there!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
