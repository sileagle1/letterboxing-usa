   SnowAngel and I certainly had a good time searching eastern <br/>
MA yesterday, even while freezing our butts off tracking down the <br/>
mystery box at the end of the world.<br/>
    I am down in CT with Sis and the kids today.  We did <br/>
Hammonasset River and some of the Chatfield series.  I <br/>
remember seeing DrewClan in at least one of those boxes.  I <br/>
had pulled the clues off the Web site for both locations yesterday, <br/>
but today they seemed to have disappeared from the Eastern CT <br/>
listings.  Is there a simple explanation for this type of thing <br/>
happening?  I am really new at this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Waldenrun<br/>
