<br/>
The best way to do Mansfield is to start at North Adams, MA, and take <br/>
the Long Trail north to Canada. You could make a side trip on <br/>
the AT from Maine Junction to Hanover, pick up your 52 boxes, <br/>
and get back on the LT. But you'd probably need The Firebolt to make <br/>
it on time, and it has moved on!<br/>
<br/>
Coming up on I-89, you can approach Mansfield from the east or the <br/>
west. The former is probably a little easier in terms of your driving <br/>
and from directions. To make a nice loop, however, you would have to <br/>
hike up (or down) the Haselton Trail, which is a Stowe ski trail. If <br/>
you don't mind that, take exit 10 (Waterbury/Stowe), drive north on <br/>
100 to Stowe, turn left on the Stowe Access Road (RT 108) right in <br/>
Stowe Village. Continue to the ski area,  park, and hike up the <br/>
Haselton Trail. Hike the ridge south to north, come down the Long <br/>
Trail to Smugglers Notch, and hike about a mile (steeply) down RT 108 <br/>
to the ski area.<br/>
<br/>
The nicer hike, IMO, is from the west side. Continue on I-89 to exit <br/>
11. Go to Jericho Center, Underhill Flats, and Underhill Center. You <br/>
will need a good road map or atlas - I won't attempt to give <br/>
directions! <br/>
<br/>
Just out of Under hill Center, you will want to bear right towards <br/>
Stephensville (a village in name only) and then on to the trailhead. <br/>
You can take either the Butler Lodge Trail or the Frost Trail - the <br/>
former gives you a nice little exposed approach to the Forehead, but <br/>
either will get you up there. The ridge is great. Take time to <br/>
explore the Cave of Winds and do a little side trip on The Subway. <br/>
After going to the summit (The Chin), backtrack along the ridge, and <br/>
take the Sunset Ridge Trail down to the CCC cutover trail, which will <br/>
rejoin the Frost Trail and take you back to your car.<br/>
<br/>
I know you are strong hikers, so I would say you can do this hiking <br/>
in 4 to 5 hours. But you ought to allow more time if you want to <br/>
enjoy the summit and the side trips. OTOH, the weather is not <br/>
supposed to be great, so you may not want to play. The main ridge and <br/>
the sunset ridge trail are all exposed, but you have lots of ways to <br/>
get down off of them fairly quickly.<br/>
<br/>
I assume you will have a mp of the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't make the right turn just out of Stephensville, you will <br/>
end up at the Underhill State Park campground. You would then hike up <br/>
the Sunset Ridge Trail, go south along the ridge, come down the Maple <br/>
Ridge Trail, and cut back to Underhill on the CCC trail where it <br/>
joins with Maple Ridge and Frost.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you have a great week-end.<br/>

rocks, it will likely be some Vermont letterboxer trying to score a <br/>
couple of unethical firsts. heh heh)<br/>

    Thanks for the trail info!  The trail leading to the Cave of Winds<br/>
sounds great!  Hopefully the weather will cooperate with us.  We are<br/>
borrowing Jay's map (Thanks Jay!)  so we can check out the trails you<br/>
suggested.  Can't wait.<br/>
    Thanks again.<br/>

<br/>
Glad you had a good hike! Send me postcards and I will plant them <br/>
this fall.<br/>
<br/>
I had a nice hike Sunday on Monadnock. Found Jay's GM #1 &amp; #2. I can <br/>
see why he likes this rockpile so much. Rocks ain't in it!<br/>
&gt; Tom,<br/>
&gt;     We can't thank you enough for your awesome trail recommendations.  We<br/>
&gt; didn't think we could do the Long Trail from Mass. to Canada and still make<br/>
&gt; it back in time for work Monday, so we decided to take the slightly shorter<br/>
&gt; route.  Even though it was a dark, cloudy morning on Saturday, we decided to<br/>
&gt; brave the giant.  We took your advice and went up the Butler Lodge Trail to<br/>
&gt; the Long Trail.  The Long Trail was great!  Expecially climbing up the<br/>
&gt; forehead!  Although the wind and slippery conditions almost made me fall<br/>
&gt; off!!  For much of the hike we could see only dark clouds around us.  No<br/>
&gt; view whatsoever, but once we reached the chin, the skies opened up to the<br/>
&gt; west and we had an unbelievable view!!  We took some time to check out the<br/>
&gt; Cave of Winds!  That was really neat!  Skipped the subway this time as we<br/>
&gt; were getting tired and it was getting late.<br/>
&gt;     After a quick, cold visit to VT's highest point, we made our way down<br/>
&gt; the Sunset Trail (luckily it was a couple of hours before sunset) to the CCC<br/>
&gt; road, then to the Frost Trail.  The whole hike was great despite the<br/>
&gt; weather, which broke into showers just as the trail went into the forest on<br/>
&gt; the way down.  Talk about timing.  Well you certainly pushed us to our<br/>
&gt; limits.  We were exhausted, but all smiles when we finally made it back to<br/>
&gt; our car.<br/>
&gt;     We did place a letterbox up there!  While it was kind of tough to find a<br/>
&gt; good hiding spot, we did manage to find one before hiking down.  I will be<br/>
&gt; working on the clues and will send them to you soon.  If you get a chance to<br/>
&gt; go, I may ask you to do us a favor.  We meant to bring postcards to put in<br/>
&gt; the box, since we will not be up to check on it too often.  We remembered<br/>
&gt; the stamps and left those in the box with our address, but forgot to stop<br/>
&gt; and pick up some postcards on the way.  Maybe we could send you (or anyone<br/>
&gt; who might plan to go up) some postcards to leave in the box.  We would<br/>
&gt; really appreciate it!!!<br/>
&gt;     Anyway, thanks again for the great directions, we managed to find the<br/>
&gt; parking area on our first try!!<br/>

&gt;hike up (or down) the Haselton Trail, which is a Stowe ski trail. If<br/>
&gt;you don't mind that, take exit 10 (Waterbury/Stowe), drive north on<br/>
&gt;100 to Stowe, turn left on the Stowe Access Road (RT 108) right in<br/>
&gt;Stowe Village. Continue to the ski area,  park, and hike up the<br/>
&gt;Haselton Trail. Hike the ridge south to north, come down the Long<br/>
&gt;Trail to Smugglers Notch, and hike about a mile (steeply) down RT 108<br/>
&gt;to the ski area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The nicer hike, IMO, is from the west side. Continue on I-89 to exit<br/>
&gt;11. Go to Jericho Center, Underhill Flats, and Underhill Center. You<br/>
&gt;will need a good road map or atlas - I won't attempt to give<br/>
&gt;directions!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just out of Under hill Center, you will want to bear right towards<br/>
&gt;Stephensville (a village in name only) and then on to the trailhead.<br/>
&gt;You can take either the Butler Lodge Trail or the Frost Trail - the<br/>
&gt;former gives you a nice little exposed approach to the Forehead, but<br/>
&gt;either will get you up there. The ridge is great. Take time to<br/>
&gt;explore the Cave of Winds and do a little side trip on The Subway.<br/>
&gt;After going to the summit (The Chin), backtrack along the ridge, and<br/>
&gt;take the Sunset Ridge Trail down to the CCC cutover trail, which will<br/>
&gt;rejoin the Frost Trail and take you back to your car.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know you are strong hikers, so I would say you can do this hiking<br/>
&gt;in 4 to 5 hours. But you ought to allow more time if you want to<br/>
&gt;enjoy the summit and the side trips. OTOH, the weather is not<br/>
&gt;supposed to be great, so you may not want to play. The main ridge and<br/>
&gt;the sunset ridge trail are all exposed, but you have lots of ways to<br/>
&gt;get down off of them fairly quickly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I assume you will have a mp of the mountain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you don't make the right turn just out of Stephensville, you will<br/>
&gt;end up at the Underhill State Park campground. You would then hike up<br/>
&gt;the Sunset Ridge Trail, go south along the ridge, come down the Maple<br/>
&gt;Ridge Trail, and cut back to Underhill on the CCC trail where it<br/>
&gt;joins with Maple Ridge and Frost.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope you have a great week-end.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;rocks, it will likely be some Vermont letterboxer trying to score a<br/>
&gt;couple of unethical firsts. heh heh)<br/>
