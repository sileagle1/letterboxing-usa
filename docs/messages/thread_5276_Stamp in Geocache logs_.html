DH and I embarked on geocaching this past weekend.  As a stamper/letterboxer, I naturally took my journal and stamp image.  Also had DH take a stamp.  Caches have log books, and cache seekers carry their own log books, so it made sense to me to use the stamp in the cache book.  But the caches didn't have stamps in them.  I did anecdotal entries into my journal of each cache find.  It sure would have been nice to have a stamped image from the cache to accompany the entry.<br/>
