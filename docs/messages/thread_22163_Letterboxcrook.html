the letterboxes have been removed by him there is very little that can <br/>
be done other than to replace them.<br/>
<br/>
I believe this individual is longing for notariety otherwise there <br/>
would not have been several posts by him.<br/>
Many immature/sick folks need to garner attention any way they can and <br/>
without the attention then their game ceases to be fun and they lose <br/>
interest in continuing that particular game. The best thing we can do <br/>
is ignore any future post, and maybe he will go back to pulling wings <br/>
off flies so that his breakfast won't stick in his throat.<br/>
