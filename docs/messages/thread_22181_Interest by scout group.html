list I belong to has been discussing using<br/>
letterboxing and geocaching with their scouts today.<br/>
<br/>
I took the opportunity to post my own experiences with<br/>
teaching my cub scouts about letterboxing in what I<br/>
believe is a responsible way and to mention the<br/>
concerns seen among letterboxers with youth groups who<br/>
are careless and I encouraged them to be responsible<br/>
leaders.<br/>
<br/>
I really believe that scouts and letterboxing have a<br/>
lot to offer to each other, so hopefully any increased<br/>
traffic that is generated as a result of the recent<br/>
discussions will be good for all.<br/>
