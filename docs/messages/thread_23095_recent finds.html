letterboxing  and was it ever worthwhile!  <br/>
    In Arkansaw, on I 40 near Forrest City, we stopped  and re-found Wanda &amp; <br/>
Pete's Adding a Splash of Color - originally found it  last summer, and yes, <br/>
it's still there, many more visitors, nice rest stop and  break.  <br/>
    In Paducah, KY, I finally got to look for  roadsideguide's <br/>
Wacinton-Chicasaw Indian Tree (couldn't do it last summer, very  frustrating!).  Didn't <br/>
really expect it to be there since the last logged  find was over a year ago, but <br/>
there it was, many logbook entries and an amazing  stamp!  Enjoyed a brief <br/>
walk on a pretty nature trail in the park as a  bonus, plus admiring the <br/>
incredible tree sculpture there.  <br/>
    We crossed the Mississippi River on the little  Hickman Ferry (that was <br/>
fun!) to reach the tiny town of Matthews, MO to find APG  Greetings' The <br/>
Harvest Cafe, in, of course, the Harvest Cafe.  The cafe  owner was absolutely <br/>
thrilled when I asked for the letterbox because it had been  there several months <br/>
and no one had yet asked for it (well, it IS a little out  of the way but <br/>
definitely worth the detour).  We were excited to be FF, and  to share our <br/>
letterboxing adventures with the owner.  <br/>
    Thanks for placing these fun boxes out  there!  <br/>
