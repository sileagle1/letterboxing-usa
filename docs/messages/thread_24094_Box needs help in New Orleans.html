I am posting to see if anyone may be making a trip to New Orleans any <br/>
time soon. I live in New Mexico and I am unable to check on one of my <br/>
boxes in New Orleans. I received an email from another boxer and was <br/>
told that the place where my Six Feet Above box is now covered with a <br/>
silver tarp. I think the box needs to be moved to another spot before <br/>
it disappears. If there is anyone out in letterboxing land that may be <br/>
able to help I would appreciate it. Thanks, lionsmane63<br/>
<br/>
