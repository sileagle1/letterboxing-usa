                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, While I have 16 letterboxes on my table &amp; since many are my older, larger boxes, I decided to try something with the new smaller containers.<br/>
 I thought I'd try using the spray paint made specifically for plastic, namely American Tradition 'plastic enamel' which says in big letters on it "Bonds to plastic" no sanding or priming required. However, when I sprayed the boxes, the paint easily scraped right off. I got this brand, because I found it first. Later in my shopping excursion however, I saw "Fusion" paint. I think it's by krylon and it's supposedly for plastic too. I didn't get any of that &amp; now I'm wondering if I should bother. Has anyone tried it?<br/>
Of course, I just assumed it would work and sprayed all 16 new boxes, which I now have to peel the paint off of!! AArggg. <br/>
<br/>
Although the plastic paint is shiny/High gloss, I also got some "matte' spray that supposedly 'dulls' it. I didn't even use that, because the black paint isn't sticking. It's back to camo tape for me!!<br/>

 Why do you paint your rubbermaid? To hide it? <br/>
Shouldn't it be well enough concealed to begin with?<br/>

<br/>
During our limited letterboxing travels, some completely 'exposed' <br/>
letterboxes that we have come across that were still alive &amp; well <br/>
were the ones that were in containers that camouflaged well with <br/>
their environment.  For example, last year we came across a <br/>
letterbox that was completely exposed--just sitting next to a tree <br/>
in an area where a group of folks had recently been 'partying' as <br/>
evidenced in the numerous mostly empty beer bottles in the area--the <br/>
letterbox was still alive &amp; well--had it been in a bright colored <br/>
rubbermaid/tupperware container it's destruction would have quickly <br/>
become the main event of the party.<br/>

<br/>
Besides the usual problems that sometimes a box isn't rehidden as <br/>
well as it originally was, other factors could dislodge the letterbox <br/>
from it's original hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
But some letterboxes are designed to "hide in plain sight".  Book-<br/>
boxes are a classic example.  A hollowed out book in a bookstore or <br/>
library are frequently used--but they're left in plain view.  Their <br/>
disguise rests on the use of camouflage.  (I'll admit, that's a very <br/>
different form of camouflage than painting the container a certain <br/>
color, but the theory is the same.)  Theoretically, it doesn't matter <br/>
if a container hidden in the woods is in plain sight or not--just so <br/>
long as only people who are looking for it find it.  In practice, the <br/>
best way to make sure only those who are looking for it find it is to <br/>
make sure the box is out of view completely.<br/>
