                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went to check on the letterbox I planted at Central City Park <br/>
(Westland MI) today, and the box is missing. I found the two ziplock <br/>
bags lying nearby, both with somne holes in them, but no sign of <br/>
box, stamp, etc. I was very disappointed, especially because I know <br/>
several people had stamped into it, and I never got to see the log!<br/>
<br/>
Please remove the box from the Michigan lsiting, I will probably <br/>
place a new box in another location close to the previous one, and <br/>
will post the new clues.<br/>
