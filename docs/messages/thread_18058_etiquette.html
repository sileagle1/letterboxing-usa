Welcome to Letterboxing from a fellow Texas Letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
Ask. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the landmarks mentioned in the clues change.  I and my son went to look for the San Jacinto Letterbox and the concrete picnic tables had been removed by the park. The placer did not know that this had happened.  The letterbox has since been confirmed that it still exists and now new clues can be written.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes clues use the term pace which to one person means one step and to others two steps.  We just did a letterbox this weekend where we paced it off using 1 pace = 2 steps and could not find it.  We retraced our route using 1 pace = 1 step and were able to find it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, what is clear to the placer is not to someone not local to the area.<br/>
<br/>
Directions using a compass while straight forward, can be a challenge for someone not familiar how to use a compass.  (Including the difference between magnetic North versus true North).  <br/>
<br/>
Knowing whether you are looking for a regular size letterbox or a microbox (film canister) can also make a difference.<br/>
<br/>

  did learn from that, however, is that tricky boxes can be found by <br/>

I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that Cristy is a scrapbooker.  I saw the dh abbreviation in the scrapbooking newsgroups.<br/>
<br/>
If you are happy with him, it means dear (or darling) husband.  If you are unhappy with him, it means [large structure for the purpose of retaining or controlling a body of water] husband (censored for those with delicate sensibilities or small children <grin>).<br/>
