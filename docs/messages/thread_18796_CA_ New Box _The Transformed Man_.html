Here's the story behind this letterbox. "The Transformed Man" was an album =<br/>
recorded in <br/>
1968 by none other than Captain Kirk, aka William Shatner.  Although the so=<br/>
ngs <br/>
themselves, including a particularly disturbing version of Lucy in the Sky =<br/>
with Diamonds, <br/>
have caused many to shudder over the years, the cover art (a half-silhouett=<br/>
e of the man <br/>
himself) literally begged out to be a rubber stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, a slip of the knife unintentionally shaved 20 years or more =<br/>
from Mr. Shatner <br/>
and the image began to take the countenance of another transformed man, Ame=<br/>
rica's own <br/>
Geek-turned-Idol, Clay Aiken.  This stamp captures Clay in a moment of clar=<br/>
ity about his <br/>
new situation: the heartthrob of millions of middle-aged women across the l=<br/>
and. I decided <br/>
to plant this stamp where it largely all began, in Glendale, home of the Al=<br/>
ex Theatre, also <br/>
known as "Hollywood" as in the gleeful contestants cry "I'm going to"<br/>
<br/>
This hike will afford you great views of downtown and the  San Fernando Val=<br/>
ley,  if that's <br/>
your thing.  I have hiked this hike a zillion times since I was a kid.<br/>
<br/>
The box is located in Brand Park, which can be reached by exiting the 134 f=<br/>
reeway at <br/>
Brand Boulevard and heading east towards the Verdugo Mountains.  Follow the=<br/>
 blue signs <br/>
to the park and library until you reach a Morrocan-inspired white gate labe=<br/>
led "Miradero."  <br/>
Go through the gate towards the library and keep to the left.  Park in the =<br/>
uppermost <br/>
parking area.<br/>
<br/>
Start up the steep dirt trail that begins at the "Miss America of the Green=<br/>
 Cross" sculpture.  <br/>
When you reach a water tank, you want to take the trail  leading off to the=<br/>
 left. This trail <br/>
leads to a large covered reservoir and a paved service road.  Turn left at =<br/>
this reservoir and <br/>
continue along the service road until you reach a convergence of three road=<br/>
s and a set of <br/>
stairs leading up to an overgrown terrace.<br/>
<br/>
Take the trail at the farthest left that follows a stone-lined flood channe=<br/>
l.  Cross the flood <br/>
channel and be sure to look right towards a set of stairs leading to a fenc=<br/>
ed in pyramid--<br/>
presumably the final resting place of old man Brand.<br/>
<br/>
Stay on the dirt trail with the flood channel on your right.  You will pass=<br/>
 two sets of ruins <br/>
from the former Brand estate on your left, including a green cinder block b=<br/>
uilding.<br/>
<br/>
You will eventually reach a dam and a set of stairs crossing the flood chan=<br/>
nel which is now <br/>
on your left.  Cross the flood channel using these steps and continue up th=<br/>
e trail to a level <br/>
area at the top of the dam.<br/>
<br/>
There are six burned palm trees in the general vicinity.  Follow the trail =<br/>
and position <br/>
yourself where the trail leads between two of the blackened palms.<br/>
<br/>
Take a bearing of 180 degrees and walk 20 paces across the mouth of the dam=<br/>
 to a flat <br/>
rock propped against its lip.  The box is under this rock, weighted down by=<br/>
 another rock <br/>
and buried in sand.<br/>
<br/>
Please rehide and rebury well.  This hiding spot is almost too perfect that=<br/>
 I worry it's a <br/>
drug dealers' drop off.  I'm fretting as much as if I actually had left Cla=<br/>
y Aiken in this spot. <br/>
I am perfectly okay with someone taking this box to a new location (perhaps=<br/>
 further up the <br/>
trail) as long as you let me know so I can modify the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I will not be able to check on this box often, so updates are appr=<br/>
eciated.  <br/>
