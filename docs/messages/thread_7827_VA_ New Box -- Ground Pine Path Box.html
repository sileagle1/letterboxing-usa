                    <div class="plaintext-content">A new letterbox was planted on September 20, 2002, at Pocahontas<br/>
State <br/>
Park in the Richmond, VA, area by M. Gainey. Pocahontas is located in <br/>
Chesterfield County.<br/>
<br/>
Once you enter the park, stay straight on the main road.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the signs toward the Civilian Conservation Corps Museum.<br/>
Park in the CCC museum lot.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the trailhead behind the museum.<br/>
<br/>
Take the Beaver Lake Trail in the direction of the Ground Pine Path.<br/>
<br/>
At the second sign, go in the direction of the Ground Pine Path.<br/>
<br/>
At the next sign, take the Ground Pine Path.<br/>
<br/>
You will eventually see a large tree with a huge cavity in it on your <br/>
left.<br/>
<br/>
The box is coming up on your right.<br/>
<br/>
The box is hidden in a hollow log on your right.<br/>
<br/>
If you go as far as the wooden bench, you've gone too far.<br/>
<br/>
Please push the box far enough back inside the log so that it is <br/>
completely hidden from view because this log is not far from the<br/>
path. <br/>
Also cover the box with pieces of bark inside the log because <br/>
non-letterboxers might be able to see the box from certain points on <br/>
the path.<br/>
