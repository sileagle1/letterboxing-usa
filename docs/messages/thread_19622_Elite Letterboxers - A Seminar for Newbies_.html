                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, my name's Madam Tiste-Sknob, but you can call me Ellie, and I want<br/>
to welcome and thank you all for coming to this seminar.<br/>
<br/>
You may not realize it, but you have already accomplished one of the<br/>
most difficult parts of the process, and that's saying to yourself "I<br/>
don't want to be a Newbie anymore!" and coming to this workshop.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that some of you may have just realized you're in the wrong<br/>
room - if you wanted the "Bitter, Table for One" Hugfest, they're<br/>
singing Kum Ba Yah and talking about us down the hall at www.lb --<br/>
what's that? Oh, thank you...it seems some of you in the back couldn't<br/>
hear.<br/>
<br/>
Now, where was I?<br/>
<br/>
I like to begin this seminar by getting to know a few of you.  Hello,<br/>
you there with the unsightly rash on your forearms and knees...who are<br/>
you and why are you here? Now, don't be shy, stand up and speak as<br/>
clearly as you can so that we can misquote you later.<br/>
<br/>
   "Umm, oh, Okay, my uh name is CareBear, and I, uh...ah, I'm tired<br/>
of being a newbie."<br/>
<br/>
Well, thank you CareBear for sharing with us. Now if you'll just stand<br/>
there quietly baring your soul to everyone, . . .<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell CareBear what his first mistake was? You, in the<br/>
back........Yes. Absolutely. Yes that's exactly right.<br/>
For those of you that didn't hear, the lurker in the back said that<br/>
"CareBear" is a VERY stupid trail name.  It brands him, now and<br/>
forever as a Newbie.  Elite Boxers aren't cutesy with their trail<br/>
names.  They choose monikers that strike terror into the hearts of<br/>
boxers everywhere.  So ditch your  nimbly-wimbly names and get others.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, CareBear, you may sit down.  Would someone pass him a<br/>
tissue, please?<br/>
<br/>
Hi! You there, with the ink on your hands, cheek and thighs.  What's<br/>
your name and why are you here?<br/>
<br/>
   "My name is SUNSH1NEE and . . .I'm tired of being picked on for<br/>
asking questions."<br/>
<br/>
Oh dear.  It looks like we're going to have to work on your name too.<br/>
 BUT - let's get right to why you're here. <br/>
<br/>
By a show of hands, who here has heard and espouses the saying<br/>
"There's no such thing as a stupid question?" Right, keep your hands<br/>
up....you too SUNSH1NEE.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone look around you at all the people with their hands up.  THESE<br/>
are the stupid people.  Yes, without apology, you're all idiots. <br/>
Never ... EVER ask a question on the boxing list. That's the quickest<br/>
way to identify you as a newbie.  All questions on the list will be<br/>
deemed stupid by someone - and you'll catch hell from complete<br/>
strangers.  Here's what you do.  Just three words.  Everyone have<br/>
their pencils ready?  Write this down.<br/>
<br/>
Assert - In - Ignorance.  <br/>
<br/>
Say it with me....ASSERT....IN....IGNORANCE. <br/>
<br/>
Very good! There are NO rules to letterboxing, so you can't do<br/>
anything wrong.  When you don't know what to do, whatever you do is<br/>
right.  This also means that YOUR way is the BEST way. And you may<br/>
assert with ignorant confidence that the way you count your Fs and Ps<br/>
is the only moral and correct way.  So get online and push your way<br/>
over the swelling ranks of newbies. <br/>
<br/>
Yes? You in the back with the F10 patch, LBNA sticker, T-shirt, Hiking<br/>
Staff and Tupperware tattoo, what's your name and why are you here?<br/>
<br/>
   "My name is FUZZI......I mean, uh, GRIZZLYBEAR and I..."<br/>
<br/>
Good recovery there! Go on.<br/>
<br/>
   "Thank you, I'm afraid my F count is low because I live in a low<br/>
box area.  I worry that I'll never pass beyond Newbie because of the<br/>
scarcity of boxes in my area."<br/>
<br/>
Everyone, calm down, this is not a problem at all.  You can easily<br/>
boost your F count.  Just go online and make a list of all the missing<br/>
boxes - then add that to your F count.  No one ever checks.  There is<br/>
no panel or commission to investigate.  Boost that number!  You can<br/>
also simply take notepad and ink to the local crafts stores and make<br/>
impressions of the entire rack of industry made rubber stamps - then<br/>
claim you were on a boxing spree in Connecticut.  That could easily<br/>
push your F count up into the stratosphere.  Soon you'll be boasting<br/>
F5000 or more!<br/>
<br/>
Okay...one more before we take our lunch break.....<br/>
<br/>
Hello, welcome, the girl on the aisle with the Gothic t-shirt and<br/>
funny ears.  Who are you and why are you here?  <br/>
<br/>
No ma'am, your ears - and hair! - ARE funny but I was speaking of the<br/>
woman with the dark blue hair, multiple piercings and black lipstick<br/>
behind you.<br/>
<br/>
  "Oh, Hi, I'm DEDLYNITESHADE73....and I just get so pissed off at<br/>
online idiots sometimes, but I'm hesitant to speak up, because I don't<br/>
want to appear mean."<br/>
<br/>
You, sweetness, are already more than on the way to being an Elite. <br/>
Fear inducing name and holier than thou attitude will move you quickly<br/>
through the ranks.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh - please don't smile like that--the chain from your nose ring to<br/>
your collar pulls your face lopsided.  Anyhoo...we WILL be covering<br/>
nom de plumes, false identities and hiding your computer ISP address<br/>
in the afternoon session. <br/>
<br/>
So now we'll...<br/>
<br/>
   "Hello?"<br/>
<br/>
Yes? May I help you?<br/>
<br/>
   "I'm DAISYCHAIN82.  I just found out about letterboxing this<br/>
morning and was directed to this site to find more information."<br/>
<br/>
Well, DAISYCHAIN82, you're right on time, come right up here to the front.<br/>
<br/>
Ladies and Gentlemen.....Lunch is served.<br/>

Don't feel too bad.  Green Turtle doesn't sound quite as ferocious <br/>

Anyhow, I have a soft spot for snickerdoodles.  What evil creature <br/>

really--we'd be better off without him hanging around these parts!<br/>
