pulled so I could put wood backings on the stamps (now that I'm<br/>
profficient at it). They should be back in action by Monday. The<br/>
following boxes are temporarilly unavailable:<br/>
<br/>
Watery Grave<br/>
Sqwished Pennies<br/>
Cambridge Parkway 1 &amp; 2<br/>
Estabrook #2<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Glad to say all of my boxes in the area are in great shape. I am<br/>
concerned about Mathman 3 however. It seems they are clearing out<br/>
the trees and the tree with the box is next in line. I couldn't<br/>
pull the box out, because the workmen showed up just as I finally<br/>
spotted the box in the "new" surroundings. Hope it is okay!<br/>
