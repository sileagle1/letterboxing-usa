                    <div class="plaintext-content">Did anyone else happen to see the very nice article in the June 6th issue of <br/>
the New Haven Advocate entitled, "Tupperware Party in the Woods"? It was <br/>
written by Hank Hoffman, who chronicles his letterboxing experience at the <br/>
Letterboxing Gathering at Sleeping Giant State Park in Hamden, CT, in May and <br/>
explains some of the in's and out's of letterboxing in general. The article <br/>
mentions and/or quotes our fellow 'boxers Butterfly, Amanda from Seattle, <br/>
Wanda and Pete, Aili, and Jay Drew. It's accompanied by two photos: one, of a <br/>
"headless" Jay Drew displaying a notebook page of some of his hand-carved <br/>
stamps; the other, of Caitlin and Ariel Drew - two of Jay's daughters - <br/>
finding a letterbox at Hammonassett Beach. <br/>
<br/>
If you'd like a photocopy of the article, please contact me off-list <br/>
<axtowner@aol.com> and I'll make arrangements with you to put one in your <br/>
hands. <br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Alan from Axtown<br/>
