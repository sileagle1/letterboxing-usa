                    <div class="plaintext-content">Took the kids out this afternoon to try our hand at letterboxing. The <br/>
very first stamp we recieved was the Frederickburg Confederate <br/>
Cemetery one. My daughter loved the stamp. She thought it was soo <br/>
cool. The humidity was awful, and I thought for sure the kids would <br/>
be done for the day, but they wanted to do more. So we headed down I-<br/>
95 and picked up the Microbox at the 108 mile mark rest area. <br/>
<br/>
Then it was off to Kmart to pick up a compass and on to our 3rd stop <br/>
of Lorelia Park in Spotsylvania Virginia. Once we got to the park, I <br/>
accidently locked my keys in the van, and had an awful time breaking <br/>
in. Finally some nice man went home and got a coat hanger and <br/>
unlocked the door for me. I live 35 miles from the park. By the time <br/>
we got in the van, the news stated head for cover, tornadoes in <br/>
Fredericksburg, so we left with out a stamp. <br/>
<br/>
Oh well, the kids are already gearing up to head out tomorrow to look <br/>
for some more. Tomorrow we head to Lake Anna State Park. I'm not <br/>
sure, but if I solved the "mystery" right, we should be able to pick <br/>
up atleast 9 at the park. Guess we will find out tomorrow if I'm <br/>
right or not! :)<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting all!<br/>
Dee who has to change her trailname because she just found out there <br/>
is already a ladybug in the group. :(<br/>
