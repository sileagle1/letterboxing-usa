take advantage of the nice weather and do some much needed running to boot!)<br/>
Wisconsin Hiker says that the railroad tracks are overgrown, but I found a<br/>
nice path along the way to run on.  Unfortunately, someone placed a white<br/>
PVC pipe sticking out of the ground I didn't see (in the middle of the<br/>
tracks near the hiding spot) and I took quite a tumble.  But I found both<br/>
boxes in great shape and the spots and stamps are great!  Got to see a bunch<br/>
of trains too!<br/>
<br/>
On the way home I stopped to check on the progress of The Neverending Story<br/>
Letterbox. It was great to see that 4 letterboxers had already found it!<br/>
Thanks for your contributions!  The box is working out great!<br/>
<br/>
Also a note about my letterboxing webpages.  I keep uploading the new pages,<br/>
and road runner keeps reinstalling my old ones.  I have no idea why they are<br/>
doing this, but if it continues I'll probably move my webpages elsewhere.<br/>
If you try a link that doesn't work, just drop me an email and I'll see what<br/>
I can do.<br/>
