Comments: Our first placed box, very exciting!<br/>
Location: Cascade Park in Bangor, Maine (Penobscot County)<br/>
The Clues: <br/>
<br/>
Cascade Park is a small, scenic area just North of downtown Bangor.  The <br/>
frequent site of  various festivals and a favorite spot for picnics, Cascade <br/>
Park is named for an artificial waterfall and fountain that run during the <br/>
summer time.  The falls and stream are fun for watching or floating small <br/>
sticks (rescued before you leave of course).  Well-surfaced trails give <br/>
access to beautiful views of the Penobscot River and the old Waterworks <br/>
building.<br/>
<br/>
Getting There:  From Route 95, take exit 46 (Hammond Street, Route 2 and 100) <br/>
and go East towards Bangor on Hammond Street.  Continue to follow Hammond <br/>
Street for about one and a half miles until Hammond turns into State Street.  <br/>
Continue Northeast on State Street for another one and a half miles and look <br/>
for the Park on the left side of the street just beyond the Eastern Maine <br/>
Medical Center.<br/>
<br/>
The Letterbox:  From the parking lot, go to the gate on the Northeast corner <br/>
of the parking lot.  You will see a gravel path going up the hill on a <br/>
compass bearing of about 20 degrees.  Follow this path for a short distance <br/>
(12 paces or so) and take the first gravel path going to the left.  This path <br/>
is on a compass bearing of 300 degrees.  Follow the path up the hill until <br/>
you reach the intersection with the other gravel path coming up the hill.  <br/>
Continue 5 paces beyond the intersection and take a grass path going to the <br/>
left on a compass bearing of 330 degrees.  Go up the grass trail for about 30 <br/>
paces and stop.  Look for a fairly large (12 inch diameter at the base) <br/>
Scotch Pine off to the left of the trail on a compass bearing of 230 degrees. <br/>
 The tree is about 20 feet off the trail and is the first large Scotch Pine <br/>
visible on that side of the trail.  Your prize is hidden under logs and bark <br/>
on the Northwest side of the tree.  If you have comments or concerns about <br/>
the condition of the letterbox, please contact us at paddle2see@aol.com.   <br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
