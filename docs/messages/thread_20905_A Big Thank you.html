Dear Letterbxoing Ham and Lazyletterboxer!<br/>
<br/>
The pleasure was all mine having a chance to go letterboxing with <br/>
you!  ISn't it fun when you just meet people and you feel like you've <br/>
known them forever? I guess that is how it is with tribe members... I <br/>
haven't met a letterboxer I didn't like!<br/>
<br/>
Having out of town visitors helped me get over a slump in my <br/>
boxplanting.  Thanks to your visit, SOnoma COunty now has 7 more <br/>
boxes.  And I have ideas for many more, just stayed up late watching <br/>
The Birds so I can write clues for a letterbox.  And your stories of <br/>
Dartmoor has me cooking up another idea for 2 Dartmoor style boxes on <br/>
the West Coast.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your wonderful visit, <br/>
Mimulus<br/>
