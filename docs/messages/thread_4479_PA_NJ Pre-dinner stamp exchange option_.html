                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to say to any of the letterboxing folks in the NJ/PA area <br/>
who might not be able to make the March 2nd Raubsville Inn dinner for <br/>
whatever reason (kids, other plans, or even just feeling nervous <br/>
about eating in front of a whole big group of new people :-) ! ) that <br/>
we'd be more than glad to try to meet earlier at a neutral spot for <br/>
exchanging stamp images.  Since we will probably be staying at the <br/>
Best Western in Easton, PA, which is just up the road from Raubsville <br/>
anyway, I would like to suggest meeting at around 4PM at the fish <br/>
passageway (Guard and Weigh) parking area, just south of the <br/>
confluence of the Leigh and Delaware rivers (if the weather is nice) <br/>
or in the lobby of the Best Western just around the corner (if it's <br/>
raining cats or dogs or snowing shad!)  We really liked the earlier <br/>
suggestion of meeting at the youth hostel, but since we've heard no <br/>
follow-up on that and have no idea where it is, we'd probably just as <br/>
soon stick with this plan.  That way we should still be able to get <br/>
in some good letterboxing on our long drive down from RI!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The idea of meeting at the youth hostel sounds like a good one, especially <br/>
since the stamp exchanging can get rather frenetic. Is it too late to book the <br/>
room at the hostel, for two hours or so, starting sometime between 2 and 4 <br/>
o'clock? If we can't get the room, we can all barge in on the Best Western. <br/>
Then, afterwards, those who are interested can go out to dinner at the <br/>
Raubsville Inn.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; From what we've seen of stamp exchange sessions at the couple of <br/>
&gt; gatherings we've attended, it's sort of like a fish feeding frenzy <br/>
&gt; anyway, so perhaps this spot would be quite appropriate!  Then the <br/>
&gt; less frantic type of socializing can be left for those continuing on <br/>
&gt; to dinner at the Inn later.  We'll bring root beer, grapes, salsa and <br/>
&gt; chips, and hope to meet at least some of you at the shad ladder in <br/>
&gt; Easton at 4PM two weeks from today, unless someone comes up with a <br/>
&gt; better idea. (And please let's not have a null reunion like the one <br/>
&gt; at Ray's Dilemma a few weeks back, where we were the only ones to <br/>
&gt; show up!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>
