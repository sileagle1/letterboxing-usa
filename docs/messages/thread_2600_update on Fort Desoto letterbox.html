I was in the Tampa area on 6/16 and I had no problem finding the Ft. <br/>
Desoto letterbox.  The directions were great (and I wasn't even <br/>
dressed for hiking in the hot sun that day!)<br/>
<br/>
However, I couldn't find the box over in the Orlando area (Florida <br/>
Fish series #1...Help?  The ditches on either side of the path were <br/>
full of water and where I thought the oak tree with palms under it, <br/>
the water came right up to the palms on the back side of the oak tree.<br/>
But perhaps I had my 100 paces wrong.  I tried two different spots <br/>
and couldn't find anything<br/>

Canaveral Letterbox is in for repairs....This must be why I couldnt <br/>
find it on 6/15!! Duh!  Well, I was out of town and am behind on my <br/>
email.  It was definitely Muggy when I hiked out there and the Smoke <br/>
from the fires in Florida was very bad that morning.<br/>
<br/>
I definitely recommend the ziplock bags.  It helps tremendously to <br/>
keep things dry (I'm from Seattle and know about moist weather)<br/>
