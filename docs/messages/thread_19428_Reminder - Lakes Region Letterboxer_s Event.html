Lakes Region Letterboxer's Event <br/>
<br/>
Date: Saturday, July 24, 2004 <br/>
Time: 10:30AM - 1:00PM EDT (GMT-04:00) <br/>
<br/>
Date: Saturday, July 24, 2004<br/>
Time: 10:30am - 1:00pm<br/>
Location: Nathaniel Hawthorne House<br/>
Contacts &amp; RSVP: Debbie Blanchard, (207) 799-2754<br/>
<br/>
What to Bring:<br/>
something scrumptious &amp; a drink for a potluck picnic<br/>
Your own lawn chair or folding chair (we'll eat outside unless<br/>
it's raining)<br/>
Your letterbox notebook; personal rubber stamp, ink pad (copies<br/>
of the trailguides will be available for $1.00 as well as a<br/>
Lakes Region Letterbox Trail stamp book for $4.00)<br/>
Your Letterboxing spirit!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions From Portland, Maine take Route 302 West, heading<br/>
towards Bridgton. Continue through Windham &amp; Raymond. Go about 2<br/>
miles further and you'll see a sign for "Cry of the Loon" gift<br/>
shop on your left. Take a left onto the Raymond Cape Road and<br/>
proceed about 1/2 mil. Look carefully for a dirt road on your<br/>
right called, "The Captain Dingley Road." Take that right. Go a<br/>
short distance until the road forks. You'll see a ball field<br/>
area. You can part there. (You may wish to continue first about<br/>
another 1/2 mile down the Raymond Cape Rd. to see where the<br/>
Hawthorne House is located before you park to unload your stuff;<br/>
there just isn't much space for parking there so we've been<br/>
asked to park at the ballfield.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There will be 7 letterboxes within a mile of the Hawthorne House<br/>
that you can do by foot! <br/>
