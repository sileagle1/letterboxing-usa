<br/>
We flew down to SC from MA on Wednesday.  In the past 2 days, I've <br/>
found 7 letterboxes (yes, I'm an over-eager novice, F10).   I can't <br/>
tell you how beautiful the stamps have been!!   There are some VERY <br/>
talented people out there (The Wolf Family!)<br/>
<br/>
I'm curious as to how people get some of the more intricate carving <br/>
done?  I bought a Speedball kit and it came with a carving tool and <br/>
2 "ends" to use.   What other things should I look for to add to my <br/>
stash for carving fine details?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>

an xacto knife and tweezers with a point help me do the finer detail.<br/>

Monte of carving sets, is, imho one to have.  Xactos don't give me <br/>
enough control...but that's just moi....<br/>
<br/>
I'm a relative newbie as well...and a bit over eager too.. just found <br/>
my 50th yesterday, and only started on Labor Day '05, yet I've placed <br/>
2, and within the week, to place #3 (in Denver, CO), with plans for a <br/>
highly punny and involved series to come.<br/>
<br/>
The trick to carving, so far for me, is picking/finding/drawing an <br/>
image with which to begin.  Really look at it before you start.<br/>
<br/>
Think positive and negative space right (that's really all stamps <br/>
are), as well as size (esp viz what size box is appropriate for the <br/>
place..)<br/>
<br/>
..have patience.  Carving is WAY easier than I thought at first, even <br/>
if I was already "artistically inclined."<br/>
