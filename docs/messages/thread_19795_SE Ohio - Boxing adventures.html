                    <div class="plaintext-content">Team Bigguy took advantage of a glorious Saturday afternoon to venture<br/>
up to Vinton county and chase down Mr. Bloodhounds 4 recently placed<br/>
boxes there.  <br/>
<br/>
We pulled in to the parking area at Hope Furnace to find approximately<br/>
every Harley Davidson east of the Mississippi trying to check through<br/>
a check point in some sort of poker run.  Black leather clad burly<br/>
bikers everywhere.  Fortunately, the box was artfully placed well<br/>
enough that we were able to get it and stamp in in plain sight almost<br/>
completely unnoticed!  One down!<br/>
<br/>
The on to Celtic Knot after passing the road by 5 or 10 miles and<br/>
driving the wrong road through and back.  Finally found the right road<br/>
and then the box with no trouble.  I think only Dragon from Wisconsin<br/>
had been there before us.<br/>
<br/>
Then on to Haunted Moonville.  Really popular place on this day -<br/>
almost a parade of people up and down that hill!  Kind of surreal to<br/>
have all that activity out in the middle of nowhere where you'd think<br/>
there would only be a visitor or two in a years time.  We had to wait<br/>
for people to leave so we could park!  Turned out to be mostly<br/>
geocachers.  We found the cache too and I must say it had the best<br/>
stuff in it of any cache I'd seen.  Believe the clue when it says you<br/>
may want to have a 4x4 to drive up to the top.  The road is not really<br/>
that bad but it has some bottomless mud holes in it that are<br/>
impossible to drive around.  You need lots of ground clearance.  It's<br/>
not that far to walk anyway.  We managed to snare the letterbox<br/>
between geocachers and found that it has significantly fewer visitors<br/>
than the cache.  All in all a great box in a cool place.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, back down the road to the famous Moonville Tunnel.  A longer<br/>
walk than we anticipated but not a bad hike really.  Most of it is<br/>
down the old railroad bed so is basicly flat.  Another really surreal<br/>
experience.  The day is perfect - 75 degrees, impossibly blue sky, and<br/>
big puffy white clouds - and we're walking down what appears to be an<br/>
endless corridor of green with the trees arching over our heads and<br/>
joining in a continuous although perforated cover.  The view is the<br/>
same in either direction - a beeline straight single width path of<br/>
light gray stone down the middle of this green corridor.  There is no<br/>
sight or sound of human activity at all.  We're walking into the<br/>
setting sun and it's almost like peoples description of a near-death<br/>
experience - walking toward the light.  Then suddenly, in the middle<br/>
of this total immersion nature experience, appears this big, beautiful<br/>
tunnel.  About 250 feet long and beautifully laid up of bricks, the<br/>
Moonville Tunnel seems completely out of place here.  It's difficult<br/>
to imagine huge fire-breathing steam engines roaring along through<br/>
this tranquil wilderness pulling clattering strings of coal cars. <br/>
It's a special place and I hope the vandals don't completely ruin it.<br/>
 They've already managed to break off a few of the brick letters<br/>
spelling out Moonville over the entrances and there's no shortage of<br/>
graffiti.  Obviously the kids know where it is.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, a great afternoon.  Beautiful, special places and great<br/>
stamps - the best that letterboxing can be.  Thanks Mr. Bloodhound! <br/>
Hope you all are having fun too!<br/>

Weather in SE Ohio has been fabulous.<br/>
<br/>
So, I've been lurking a couple months now, but curiosity compels me to ask<br/>
where Mr. Bloodhound's Vinton County clues can be found . . . is there a<br/>
seperate site?<br/>
<br/>
We have been having a terrific summer with Bigguy's Letterboxes (first rate,<br/>
we're your biggest fans!), Salamander's (very fun, but a few seem to be<br/>
either missing or damaged), and Franzsolo's (such a smart, friendly chap).<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes to All--<br/>

Hi!  Welcome to southern Ohio letterboxing!  Thank you for your kind<br/>
words about our boxes.  Mr. Bloodhound's Vinton County letterboxes can<br/>
be found by going to the main LBNA site, selecting Ohio on the big<br/>
map, then selecting Southeastern Ohio on the Ohio map, and then<br/>
scrolling down the list to near the bottom where the Vinton county<br/>
boxes will be found since they seem to be alphabetized by county.  Or,<br/>
if you just want Mr. B's, choose search for boxes, click on his name<br/>
on the placer list, and click search.  If I can be of further help,<br/>
feel free to write at: bigguy9210 at yahoo dot com.  We'd love to meet<br/>
you for an exchange sometime.  Happy boxing!<br/>

I've lived in in this area for 8 years and would have never seen<br/>
some of the more spectacular views you guys have scouted<br/>
if it wasn't for boxing (even though we've always hiked--<br/>
just the more "touristy" trails I guess).<br/>
<br/>
Just as an update for a couple of your boxes:<br/>
Bee-gin Again--A&amp;W on 7/28<br/>
Script Ohio--A&amp;W on 8/1<br/>
Sythian Fish--A&amp;W on 8/5 [V. Nice location &amp; stamp!]<br/>
<br/>
Quilting Bee could simply be rather elusive (after all, I didn't notice that<br/>
Wellston and Zaleski were in Vinton) . . . .<br/>
<br/>
Cheers--<br/>
