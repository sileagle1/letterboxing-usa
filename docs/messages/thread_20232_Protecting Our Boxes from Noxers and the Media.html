                    <div class="plaintext-content">    Actually, during a discussion on this very list about this same subject<br/>
two weeks ago, that's exactly what several people chose to suggest -- that<br/>
reporters are low-lifes with nefarious aims, so as you can imagine I took<br/>
offense.  So, that's why I included the tag in my signature -- it was an<br/>
attempt to personalize these nebulous "media" people -- we're your next door<br/>
neighbors, too, and by and large don't have some evil plan.<br/>
    You're right, giving reporters the right information doesn't ensure it<br/>
will be reported correctly.  But purposefully avoiding answering their<br/>
questions can only increase the chance of that happening.<br/>
    As for someone giving up on a letterboxing story after several no's,<br/>
perhaps.  And perhaps not.  My main point and opinion remains --<br/>
purposefully avoiding reporters in the hopes that they'll go away is not a<br/>
good strategy, because by and large they'll probably find a way to write the<br/>
story without you.  So, the exposure part is unavoidable as far as I can<br/>
see.  That leaves damage control to be done on what sorts of things you want<br/>
to see emphasized in coverage.  So, in my opinion, in general, all silence<br/>
will get you is an increased chance at a story that you think sucks.<br/>
