Author Releases Book into the Wilds of Oregon<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mystery. Adventure. Exploration. Treasure. <br/>
<br/>
Books gone wild?<br/>
<br/>
That's the premise behind a new expedition called Trail of the Book, <br/>
which is set to kick off at mystery Oregon location in October.<br/>
<br/>
Trail of the Book is the brainchild of author Wayne Standiford of <br/>
Condon, OR. Standiford's book, Bury Me With Soldiers, a personal <br/>
account of his experiences as a Marine in Vietnam, was published <br/>
earlier this year by First Books Library. Since then he has been <br/>
looking for unique ways to promote it.<br/>
<br/>
He came up with Trail of the Book after learning about two new <br/>
pastimes sweeping the nation. One is called "letterboxing," the <br/>
other "BookCrossing." Standiford also used ideas from his own program <br/>
called The Trail of Bones. Trail of Bones is an educational program <br/>
he has developed and teaches at the local grade school. This endeavor <br/>
combines navigational skills and forensic science. The students study <br/>
these two subjects and then go on an expedition and solve a mystery.<br/>
<br/>
"I was searching for a way to introduce my book to the reading <br/>
public. Then I came upon www.letterboxing.org and <br/>
www.bookcrossing.com. These two sights gave me the idea for combining <br/>
my love of the outdoors and my background as a navigator," Standiford <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
If you've never heard of letterboxing, you're not alone. Although the <br/>
sport has been around some 150 years, it didn't reach this country <br/>
until April, 1998, following the publication of a Smithsonian <br/>
Magazine article on the craze in England. By the end of the year <br/>
2000, there were boxes in 47 of the 50 states. Today 5,000 <br/>
letterboxes are scattered throughout North America, according to <br/>
those in the know.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, BookCrossing is relatively new but quickly gaining in <br/>
popularity. Since its inception in 2001, over 500 thousand books have <br/>
been "released into the wild" by readers happy to share a good read <br/>
with a friend or stranger. <br/>
<br/>
So what is letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
Don't let the name fool you. This is not a sport for couch potatoes <br/>
or Victorian ladies with hours to spend on precisely drawn curlicues. <br/>
At the same time, you don't have to be a renowned mountain-climber or <br/>
world-class athlete to participate.<br/>
<br/>
All it takes is a good pair of walking shoes, a compass, and <br/>
protractor. (Don't let the compass and protractor scare you. They're <br/>
easy to learn. Just check out the NAVIG page on Standiford's web <br/>
site, www.rapidradio.us.)<br/>
<br/>
Basically, it works like this: Someone hides a waterproof box <br/>
somewhere. Generally the location is a scenic or remote, but public <br/>
area that people can easily access. The box contains a logbook, a <br/>
carved rubber stamp, and other goodies. The hider then writes <br/>
directions or "clues" to the box. The clues generally involve map <br/>
coordinates or compass bearings from local landmarks. The object, of <br/>
course, is to find the letterbox. Hunters keep track of their finds <br/>
by stamping a logbook.<br/>
<br/>
BookCrossing works in much the same way, but instead of letterboxes, <br/>
people hide books. First, the hider registers the book at <br/>
www.bookcrossing.com. The book is assigned a unique ID so that it can <br/>
be tracked from reader to reader. Whoever finds the book enters the <br/>
find at the BookCrossing website, reads the book, and releases it <br/>
into the wild for someone else to find.<br/>
<br/>
Ron Hornbaker, the concept's originator, explains it this way: "You <br/>
know the feeling you get after reading a book that speaks to you, <br/>
that touches your life, a feeling that you want to share it with <br/>
someone else? BookCrossing.com gives you a simple way to share books <br/>
with the world, and follow their paths forever more!"<br/>
<br/>
Trail of the Book combines the challenge of navigation with clues, <br/>
logbooks, and the promise of a good read at the end of the trail. <br/>
<br/>
"Hunters will navigate a course and follow clues that will ultimately <br/>
provide a final solution of a certain location or answer to a problem <br/>
presented. In this case the clues will be found in a city in Oregon," <br/>
said Standiford. <br/>
<br/>
The first clue is posted on his web site www.rapidradio.us.  After <br/>
determining the starting point, hunters must travel to the mystery <br/>
city where they will receive an official expedition logbook. "The <br/>
logbook is essential. You must use it to record your journey as you <br/>
navigate from point to point, and your solutions to each clue or <br/>
problem," Standiford said. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to a compass and protractor, participants should bring <br/>
the cardboard core from a roll of toilet paper.<br/>
<br/>
A toilet paper core?<br/>
<br/>
"That's my modern day version of a Spartan baton," Standiford <br/>
explained. "The ancient Spartan warriors would wrap a strip of paper <br/>
or cloth around a baton. The paper or cloth contained a coded <br/>
message. One lucky, or not so lucky soul, depending on your point of <br/>
view, was chosen to carry the baton through or around enemy lines and <br/>
deliver it to the officer in charge. The receiving officer would <br/>
remove the strip and wrap it around his own baton, which provided the <br/>
means for the deciphering the code. This code system was called the <br/>
scytale."<br/>
<br/>
The box at the end of the trail will contain a coded strip similar to <br/>
the ones used by ancient Spartans. This code, when cracked, will <br/>
enable the hunter to solve the final problem and be entered into a <br/>
drawing for prizes. In order to be eligible for the drawing, <br/>
participants must be at least 18 years old and have accurately <br/>
completed their official logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
The prizes that have been confirmed as of this release are:<br/>
 A television satellite system donated by the local phone company<br/>
 Merchandise from the local mercantile <br/>
 Three hardback personalized copies of Bury Me With Soldiers <br/>
 Free lunch for two at the local drive in<br/>
 More prizes to be added<br/>
<br/>
The local chamber of commerce is co-sponsoring the event.<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested in joining the Trail of the Book expedition, you <br/>

The expedition is slated to conclude Nov. 15. <br/>

I had never heard of this but it sounds great!  I am amazed<br/>
how many books are already out there waiting to be shared.<br/>
