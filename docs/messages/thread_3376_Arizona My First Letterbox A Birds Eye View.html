<br/>
GPS: N34.04.634 W122.34.239<br/>
<br/>
Distance: About 36 miles round trip. <br/>
Time: About 3-4 hours, including time to explore.<br/>
Features: Great desert scenery along the way, three separate mine ruins.<br/>
Driving Conditions: First (and last) 3 miles of trip is on paved  road from <br/>
Wickenburg. Remainder of trip on maintained and unmaintained unpaved  roads. <br/>
High clearance vehicle required; 4WD useful in some steep places. Not <br/>
recommended during rainy weather.<br/>
Equipment: Bring water, good hiking shoes (if you plan to go exploring), and <br/>
your camera. It's a good idea to wear long  pants, socks, and shoes when <br/>
exploring the ruins. <br/>
Warning: This destination includes many open vertical mine  shafts and <br/>
building ruins. Exploring mines and old buildings is dangerous.  Digging or <br/>
taking rocks away from mining claims is illegal. <br/>
***Pay extra attention around the buildings for snakes, scorpions and Bees.***<br/>
The Drive<br/>
Leaving Wickenburg going toward Phoenix on East Wickenburg Way, cross the <br/>
bridge over the Hassayampa and turn left at Constellation Road.  Continue on <br/>
past the rodeo grounds and beyond. The pavement ends after a few  miles and <br/>
becomes maintained unpaved road. It continued to be an easy drive, one that <br/>
any car could handle. <br/>
The first major turn was for Blue Tank Road. We knew from  experience that <br/>
making a left at this fork would eventually take us back to Rincon Road and <br/>
the Hassayampa River. <br/>
The road continues on relatively flat terrain for a while, with  glimpses of <br/>
bright yellow poppies and blue lupines along the way. There were  plenty of <br/>
turnoffs, on the left and right sides of the road. One led to a ranch.  <br/>
Others led to who knows where. The road gets hilly and winds through the <br/>
hills  for a while. You will come down a steep road to King Solomon Wash. The <br/>
road ran  in the wash for a short distance, past Sayer Spring, where some <br/>
people had set  up an impressive camp at Sayer or Gilbert, which was a half <br/>
way house for the  miners and travelers. The road seemed to fork after that, <br/>
but keep to the left,  and climb out of the wash to stay on Constellation <br/>
Road. A BLM mile marker and a  sign to the Williams family Ranch is at the <br/>
start of the road. As you climb the  hill, you can see that many people set <br/>
up camps in a flat area near the wash. <br/>
At the top of the hill in a saddle-like area climb out for a  look. Behind <br/>
you, back the way you come, is Wickenburg, barely visible as white  dots <br/>
nestled in a valley. Ahead was the mountainous terrain that was the foothills <br/>
of the Weaver Mountains. <br/>
Continue on driving down the side of a hill. To the left, you'll spot the  <br/>
telltale signs of mining -- huge tailing piles and the ruins of some stone <br/>
buildings.<br/>
Not far down the road you'll spot some old mining structures which are the  <br/>
remains of the Monte Cristo Mine. A few of the buildings are in remarkably <br/>
good  condition, although the housing the machinery for the mine shaft wasn't <br/>
 supported and would probably be extremely dangerous.<br/>

In the distance from the upper level you can see the Black Rock Mine on the <br/>
side of the hill.<br/>
On the road again, You'll cross Slim Jim Creek and just up ahead there is a <br/>
horse corral with water. Continue up the road approx. .53 miles and turn to <br/>
the  left stopping just after the your turn. <br/>
There will be a small hill in front of you.<br/>
Walk up the hill and on Top under the rocks you will find the letterbox.<br/>
[Unable to display image]<br/>
(This is a letterbox, geo-cache in one, please be sure to stamp the correct <br/>
book.)<br/>
Take plenty of time to enjoy the view remembering all those that have past <br/>
this way before you. <br/>
If you wish to explore more, continue on up the road and you will find The <br/>
Gold Bar Mine on the left. [Unable to display image]<br/>
Like the Monte Cristo Mine, this mine's buildings were built with wood and <br/>
corrugated metal. The building that housed the mine shaft machinery was in  <br/>
pretty good shape, although one end is caving in. Another building that is in <br/>
 pretty good shape is the garage or workshop. In the valley below, you can <br/>
see  signs of other shafts and the ruins of buildings that aren't in such <br/>
good shape.<br/>
