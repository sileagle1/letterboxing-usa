room we'll be needing!  You can just send me e-mail if you don't want <br/>
to post on the board, but it's good to know if a table for four is <br/>
all that's needed or if we'll need enough room for 20!  =)  Although <br/>
I'd be surprised if THAT many people showed up, I'd certainly be <br/>
thrilled if it did happen!  =)<br/>
