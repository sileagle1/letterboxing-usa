Howard Co. MD. We successfully slogged through the snirt to find all <br/>
of Firefly's boxes.<br/>
    Then we decided to look for Appledumpling Gang's "Out of the <br/>
Frying Pan and Into the Fire". You thought "Froggy" was tough, we <br/>
gave up. Nothing made sense. Scorpios, prisons and murals, Oh My!!!!!!<br/>
I understand some people have found them but we kept going around in <br/>
circles and NOTHING looked remotely like it would fit with the clues!<br/>
Could someone send me a wee clue to start us in the right direction. <br/>
Please!<br/>
