2/2/04. This was a great experience for me as I am new to <br/>
letterboxing, it was such a pleasure to meet so many new people and <br/>
to put faces with some of the stamps that I have seen earlier.<br/>
But sorry to say I lost my stamp &amp; ink pad it was a firecracker (red) <br/>
which stood for my path name Patriotic Girl. If anyone found it could <br/>
you please e-mail me.<br/>
 Thank_you All for a great time.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found an extra stamp while out boxing today. Does anyone know <br/>
anything about a hitchhiker called Birthday HayDay?  I found a stamp - <br/>
looks kinda like a balloon - but no matching log book.  The log for <br/>
the box it was in showed where someone had dropped off the HH (9/05) <br/>
and the following entry said someone picked it up and would take it to <br/>
Orlando to plant it.  I'm guessing those people took the logbook but <br/>
not the stamp, by accident or ignorance.  I would be happy to give it <br/>
a new log and send it out again, but would like to credit the original <br/>
carver/planter/owner.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone offer any suggestions?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
