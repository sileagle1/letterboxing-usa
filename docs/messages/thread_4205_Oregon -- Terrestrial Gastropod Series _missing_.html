It unfortunately appears our Terrestrial Gastropod Series (2 boxes) <br/>
have swam away into the great unknown.  <br/>
<br/>
After a quick check on their condition today, neither were to be <br/>
found and instead the area's in which they once lived were replaced <br/>
by yards of muck and mud.  It would seem that 30+ day stretch of rain <br/>
did indeed cause some havoc in the low lands.  In some areas, the <br/>
tree's had water marks two feet above their base.<br/>
<br/>
For others in this area, who have also placed boxes in area's near <br/>
bodies of water, you might want to check on their condition, as they <br/>
too may have been affected.<br/>
<br/>
If possible, Mitch, please put a note on our clue page that these <br/>
boxes are missing but to stay tuned for the rebirth of the series in <br/>
the near future.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
Apologies for missing your post.  Beth has sent you a private email <br/>
today regarding the empty box you have.  Thanks for notifying us!<br/>
<br/>
Noble Park is quite a bit nicer in the summer than the areas you had <br/>
to wade through, but we learned a good lesson.  We will work to find <br/>
a better suited location for the boxes and relaunch the series in the <br/>
near future.<br/>
