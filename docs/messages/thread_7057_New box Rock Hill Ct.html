                    <html><body>RTRW and I planted this box today while in Dinosaur State Park.  This is off Rt 91 about 1 mile east of Exit 23 in Rocky Hill Ct.<br/>
Closed Monday (except for the trails), the park is open other days from 9 till 4, I think.  You can bring plaster and make casts of dino prints-how neat is that!<br/>
There is another box planted here-Walk thru Geologic Time-if you want another quest.<br/>
<br/>
Clues for the Native Flower Box:<br/>
Seated in the Amphitheater (grab a trail map in the information booth) you will see several options for paths.  Chose the one most directly in front of you, which happens to be the blue trail.  Do not go over the Swamp Boardwalk (at least not on your hunt.  It is a neat place, but buggy).<br/>
There is a wildflower meadow on your right.  If you go in the winter you will have to take our word for it; it is lovely.<br/>
Find the hemlocks guarding the entrance to the blue trail.  From there go 12 paces (a pace is 2 steps) along the path.  Stop there and take a compass reading of 180.  4 steps off the path will take you to your treasure.  <br/>
Please be discrete; this is pretty visible to the other areas of the park.  Hide it well when you are finished.<br/>
