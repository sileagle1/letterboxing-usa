I get the digest form of the postings and typically delete them<br/>
right after reading them, but I remembered someone saying to<br/>
go back to the October archives for the patch order form and<br/>
information. I found some conflicting stuff in the archives(one<br/>
place said to make the checks to Valerie Gilson, another to Town<br/>
Hall Embroidery.) Could someone please clarify?<br/>
<br/>
Who does the check need to be made out to?<br/>
What address do I send the order to?<br/>
Are logo patches still $2 each?<br/>
How much tax?<br/>
What is the weight of each patch/How much postage is needed on<br/>
the SASE?<br/>
What is the deadline for this order?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Refer back to Valerie's post (#4936) dated January 19th.  That should <br/>
answer all your questions.<br/>
