&gt; from orienteering<br/>
<br/>
I have placed a letterbox (Hickory "O" Run, #10) based on the permanent <br/>
orienteering course in Hickory Run State Park (Carbon County - Eastern <br/>
PA).  Details can be found at http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box10.html<br/>
Hickory Run is a beautiful place, and the orienteering map there is one<br/>
of my favorites (and one of the most challenging in the area).<br/>
<br/>
I have also placed a second letterbox in Hickory Run (Hickory Trail Run, #11)<br/>
for folks who are there but don't feel like doing the orienteering, with<br/>
rather straightforward (for me :-)) (1 star) clues.  Details at<br/>
http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box11.html<br/>
<br/>
Finally, for those with too much time on their hands, I have placed a<br/>
mystery box (Merlin's Pre-Columbian Mysteries, #9), not in Hickory Run<br/>
with rather difficult (4 star) clues.  Details at<br/>
http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box9.html<br/>
<br/>
I know of 11 boxes now in PA, and feel pretty confident that we are gonna<br/>
catch those Oregon folks :-) (Of course, we're well ahead of them on boxes<br/>
per sq. mile, but I'm sure VT takes the lead on that one ...)<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting :-)<br/>
<br/>
[For the other webmasters, this affects the PA, NJ, and NY panels.  I have<br/>
generated new maps in the usual place with Hickory Run (the NY one is a <br/>
mess).]<br/>

I had best get busy - VT is (relatively speaking) losing our lead,<br/>
which, if I remember rightly, we led in per-capita only.<br/>

<br/>
I learned about orienteering and letterboxing at about the same time, <br/>
a little over a year ago.  During the past year, I've done much more <br/>
orienteering than letterboxing. I did get a few friends into <br/>
orienteering and took two of them to Hickory Run to look for your <br/>
boxes today. We found them! I've looked for you VF walk in the woods <br/>
box about five times. The last two times, I was in the right area, <br/>
but I still haven't found that one. <br/>
