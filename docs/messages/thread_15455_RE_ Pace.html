Well I'm 6ft. plus and Gwen is 5ft. some times we average the number of paces. Other times we have set up paces between two easily identifiable objects early in the clues so that a finder has a basis to work from. The finder then would know how far 10 paces is for example. We have also used the term "Big Guy" paces, when we are just using my paces. We used to try to figure out what the definition of a pace was, and I believe there is something written up in the FAQS, but for the last year or so we just call a pace a "foot fall", count them out and use that in our clues. If you are sending a finder to a specific identifiable object then an approx. distance works. If you are sending a finder to a series of coordinates then the method we use will not work. Don<br/>

It's late, what are we doing up this late thinking about silly <br/>
letterboxing?  Hey!  I just finished carving two new letterbox stamps <br/>
that I'm going to plant in The Los Angeles Coun--, Oh, never mind--<br/>
like I said, it's too late for this stuff!<br/>
