 Hi Mohmers!<br/>
<br/>
     No patches, yet, but I was one of the later ones to send you money.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi. Still no patches. I'll send another check and trust the mails will get <br/>
through this time if that's OK with you. Or, if no order is in the offing, <br/>
I'll wait until you tell me it's a good time to order again - that is, when <br/>
you'll be sending another order.<br/>
<br/>
I would still like five 2 x 2 patches at $2.15 each.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Should I make the check out to Kay Mohmers or Town Hall?<br/>
<br/>
Second time is the charm.  :o)   Mary Smock<br/>

 Haven't received patches yet. My request ( and check ) was for 6 decals <br/>
and<br/>
 5 2x2 LbNA patches. I received the decals about 2 weeks ago. No patches<br/>
 yet.  Mohmers, shall I let the mails flow for a few more days?   Mary <br/>

HI Mary,  I have you down for 5 patches.  They should have gotten to you by <br/>
now but, if you don't mind give them a few days and let me know.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,  Mohmers<br/>
