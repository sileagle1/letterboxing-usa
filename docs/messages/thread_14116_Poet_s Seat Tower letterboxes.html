Greenfield, Mass. One of them was stolen earlier, so I had to replace<br/>
it, at a new location. I've also added a fourth box. This one is in a<br/>
very public place so I doubt it will last the summer. So, find it while<br/>
it's hot. Limited edition, guaranteed. <br/>
<br/>
I put down the new boxes July 4, 2003. Unfortunately, there were two<br/>
people who came ahead of me that very day. So, they hit the missing<br/>
third box and went home without it. So, to Little Man and Curious Crane:<br/>
Thanks for the poems. I hope you can get back there someday. Cheers,<br/>
Adam<br/>
