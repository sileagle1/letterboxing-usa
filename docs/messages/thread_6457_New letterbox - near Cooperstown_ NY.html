Length: .7 miles to letterbox.  Loop trail is 3.2 miles.<br/>
Degree of Difficulty:  Easy.  Bring compass and bathing suits for a swim in the lake if you want.<br/>
<br/>
Located in Glimmerglass State Park, 8 miles north of Cooperstown, NY in Otsego County on County Highway 31.<br/>
<br/>
Glimmerglass State Park offers camping, fishing, hiking, and swimming at a life-guarded beach on Otsego Lake during the summer.  During winter, the park offers a great snow-tubing hill, ice skating, cross-country skiing and ice fishing.  There is a $6 per car entrance fee (free after 7 pm).  Hyde Hall Mansion, an historic property, is also located in the park.  The park offers summer concerts and a triathlon competition in August.  For more information, check out <b><a href="http://www.nysparks.state.ny.us/parks/">www.nysparks.state.ny.us/parks/</a></b> .  <br/>
<br/>
To find the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Park your car in one of the lots past the beach parking lot.  At the end of the paved road, you will find a dirt road which begins the trail.  (Hyde Hall Mansion will be to your right.)  Walk on this dirt road, the lake to your left, for a few minutes, until you reach an orange-blazed trail to the right.  Turn right onto this trail which will continue uphill for about .7 miles.<br/>
<br/>
At the top of the hill, there will be a view of the lake through the trees on the left.  You will come upon a large fallen tree with a large exposed root system to the right of the path.  Continue on the path about 40 steps to a large rock on the left side.<br/>
<br/>
About 45 steps after the rock there is a large dead tree, still standing, to the left of the path.  Caution: beyond the tree and on the left side of the path there is a sharp drop-off.  The opposite side of this tree has large orange arrow markings.  From this tree, take an easterly bearing of 110 degrees.  About 40 steps away in this direction, you will find an area with several downed trees.  There will be a 12 foot stump, and just beyond a 5 foot stump.<br/>
<br/>
To the right of the 5 foot stump is a large log.  You will find the letterbox behind the log under some bark.  Look out for chipmunks (and perhaps other creatures.)<br/>
<br/>
Return to you car by the way you came or continue on the orange-blazed trail for another 2.5 miles to complete a loop where you will return on the opposite side of Hyde Hall Mansion.</p></body></html>
