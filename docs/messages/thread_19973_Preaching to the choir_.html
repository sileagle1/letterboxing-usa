We went letterboxing today at Bird Park in Walpole, MA. The first box we found was fine. The second and third were exposed. The ferns around one were so trampled it was obvious there was a path leading to it and the box was not covered up behind the tree. We rehid it well but we couldn't really do too much about the ferns. <br/>
<br/>
The third box we found was behind its tree. Not a single leaf, rock or twig on top of it! It was totally exposed. We rehid this well also. <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to remind old and new alike to rehide very well. I know this has been written many times before but I have never experienced such blatant disregard for rehiding as I did today and it was very discouraging. The last person there was there yesterday! <br/>

P.S. I did notify the placers of all the boxes we found through the LBNA site. <br/>

about new boxers about to embark on a visit to some boxes I recently<br/>
planted. They wanted to know whether to re-hide in the same spot. I<br/>
confirmed that this was the case and that every effort must be made<br/>
to re-hide as well or better as how you found it. At least this<br/>
person took the time to contact me and ask. For that, I commend them.<br/>
