                    <div class="plaintext-content">Pam, it is usually a good idea to walk away from the hiding spot a <br/>
bit to do the stamping, just depends on where you are and how exposed <br/>
you are.  When you are out in the open and there are likely to be <br/>
people around, walking away is a good idea.  Out in the middle of the <br/>
woods where you are not so likely to encounter other people (or a <br/>
bench), just finding a convenient log nearby may be good enough.  <br/>
<br/>
Benches are always nice because they give you a good place to lay out <br/>
all your stuff...  I actually walked about 1/4 mile back up the trail <br/>
just to get to a bench one time because it had rained and everything <br/>
around was wet and dirty.<br/>
<br/>
I think more important than people seeing you stamping in is to be <br/>
careful that you are discreet when you retrieve and replace the box.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wouldn't say that you have to act like a secret agent or anything (play <br/>
"mission impossible music" here), but in very public areas I usually try not to <br/>
attract attention to myself. <br/>
<br/>
When we go boxing, our 'gear' resembles art supplies (sketchbook log, markers <br/>
etc) so if we take our time stamping in we probably look like folks doing <br/>
some sketching etc.<br/>
<br/>
With kids, it's a bit harder, since they get so excited when they find a box. <br/>
I have taken camp groups boxing and older kids (ages 7+) really love to be <br/>
secretive. It's very fun for them to try to act 'nonchalant' and keep it to <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
If you are seeking a box in a public building...like a library or museum etc. <br/>
be very careful. As you can imagine, in this day and age of terrorism etc you <br/>
can imagine that a person seen looking suspicious or sneaking around could <br/>
quickly attract the wrong kind of attention.<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, don't worry too much about it. It's supposed to be fun.<br/>
So....have fun!<br/>
