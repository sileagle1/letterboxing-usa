<br/>
I like LBing for the creative aspect and geocaching<br/>
for the high-tech fun. <br/>
<br/>
I'm up in Canada where LBing was just a tiny blip on<br/>
the radar a year ago but it's starting to grow. We<br/>
have 85 LBs in Ontario now. But compared to geocaches<br/>
(over 3000) it's still just a blip. <br/>
<br/>
I hope your family enjoys finding and hiding boxes as<br/>
much as we have.<br/>
