Found the Buffy box and it, as well as the search, were totally cool!  Had a<br/>
great time and loved it!  Picked up the hitchhiker, too, which we intended<br/>
on depositing in our next find...however, we attempted a couple of the<br/>
mathman series after that and came up unsuccessful on both -- very<br/>
frustrating -- math makes my  head hurt!!  But Blaze is pretty mathmatically<br/>
literate so we thought it would be possible to locate them. On the Port<br/>
Washington one, after solving the practice/sample matrix correctly, we were<br/>
unable to get the other matrices solved :-(  Attempted the same strategies<br/>
as outlined in the practice one, but they just wouldn't work.  We managed to<br/>
get halfway through the clues just on our personal knowledge of the area,<br/>
but came up short when finding the final hiding spot.  After a few hours we<br/>
just wrote it up as a wash -- cus i couldn't take it anymore :)<br/>
<br/>
Went to the West Bend one following that, and found what we believe is the<br/>
correct spot...but no box.  It does look like the hiding spot had been<br/>
ransacked, however, so it might be MIA already.  It seemed to be in a pretty<br/>
heavily teen populated area judging by the names carved in almost every<br/>
surrounding tree, so it might have just been discovered and taken.  Or we<br/>
were completely wrong in our location, but we double checked the math.  Who<br/>
knows...I was too tired at that point to try again :)<br/>
<br/>
With all the great old cemeteries in the area, maybe a Buffy box series<br/>
would be in order?  huh, huh?  :-)<br/>
<br/>
And Baby Jinks will find a new home before the week's end....after my head<br/>
stops  hurting from all the math :)<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] WI-New Box in Milwaukee - Buffy Box<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In honor of the final episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, my step-daughter<br/>
(Rua) who is a huge fan (me too), and my Vampire-loving wife, I have placed<br/>
a new box in Milwaukee - the Buffy Box!<br/>
<br/>
As an extra incentive, the first finder will also find my new hitchhiker -<br/>
Baby Jinks!<br/>
