I have a few reasons for this,<br/>
<br/>
One is that I need the money, usually $12 for a not too complicated<br/>
carving and I really enjoy carving.<br/>
<br/>
Two, is that when I go boxing I really like to find a hand carved<br/>
stamp in the box as well as read a log that contains cool carvings.<br/>
For someone like me who likes art as well as boxing it can be a<br/>
disappointment to go on a long hike only to find a stamp from Walmart.<br/>
[Please don't flame me for this, it is really just personal preference<br/>
not an ultimatum] But I do understand that some people might not want<br/>
to carve for whatever reason, so I feel that I provide a service.<br/>

So there you have it. [Been tiptoeing around this for a while, can you<br/>

is secondary. We just love the HUNT! It's like a modern day quest, so <br/>
the prize is finding the box (and seeing the location in many cases). <br/>
<br/>
I just don't feel right faulting someone who doesn't feel comfortable <br/>
with their artistic talent or who just wants buy a stamp so it LOOKS <br/>
right. I personally tried carving our signature stamp (a sprite <br/>
sitting on a claymore) but it just didn't turn out the way I <br/>
wanted...details were too muddy and didn't show the pic to its best <br/>
advantage. So, I put that stamp into our hostel (knowing how people <br/>
prefer the handcarved stamps) and sent the picture off to be made <br/>
into a stamp. <br/>
<br/>
Now we've got the best of both worlds and we STILL get to go <br/>
letterboxing! ;-) <br/>
