Located in NE CT <br/>

whacking <br/>
Difficulty of clues: Easy once figured out <br/>

I'm the mascot of a school that doesn't have a team. Yet <br/>
there are two homes for me. One has giant friends <br/>
nearby. The other is in a quieter corner. The "Main" <br/>
idea is to pick the right one. <br/>
<br/>
Parking past the furthest door. Walk to where you would <br/>
hear Pomp and Circumstance down the hill. Standing <br/>
alongside the plague sight 210' and head to a pine. I'm <br/>
under there. (Please be careful of my branches and hide <br/>
me well.) <br/>
<br/>
When you have replaced me walk 18 steps at 260' to a <br/>
trail. Follow to a clearing. <br/>
<br/>
Looking at the South Southeast side at about 140' to <br/>
160'. And looking about 10 feet into the air. Bush-whack <br/>
about 10 feet (or walk around) to the hemlock. My home <br/>
is under the rocks. (Please hide me well so no one will <br/>
find me.) <br/>
