Luther Burbank Park<br/>
Mercer Island<br/>
King County<br/>
Washington State<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:  Take I-90 E or W to Mercer Island.  Take Island Crest <br/>
Way exit, turn North, follow the "small brown" signs toward the <br/>
park.  Start at the SE 26th St entrance parking lot (not the main <br/>
entrance parking lot!!!).<br/>
<br/>
NOTES:  Park is open from 8am-9pm (this may be seasonal).  This park <br/>
is ideal for children &amp; pets.  There is an AWESOME playground (one <br/>
of the best in the area) and a nice little beach.  Be cautious along <br/>
a few parts of the trail near the water.  Roundtrip distance to the <br/>
box = 1-1/2 miles.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  From the metal trail post on the W end of the parking lot, <br/>
follow the trail at 25, next choice? stay 10.  When you cross <br/>
a 'rocky' portion of the trail, investigate "The Source".  Back to <br/>
the path, head 35 toward the beach.  From the sand, follow the trail <br/>
at 350.  A dock?  #9?  A red brick smokestack near a concrete <br/>
marina?  Look for the hands holding the chain.  Head to the <br/>
playground.  From beneath the purple circle, follow the 'red brick <br/>
road' to the checkerboard under the awning.  Take the trail at 335.  <br/>
Then take 240.  See the theatre?  330 trail, pass the b-ball court.  <br/>
Dog park on R, old building remains on L. From N tip of building, <br/>
head 20, "Who let the dogs out?", Head 290 to find them...  From #6, <br/>
head 315.  See a concrete circle on the ground?  What about 2 <br/>
benches?  Pick the one nearest the wet boulders.  270 to an old log <br/>
staked into the ground.  I am within--closest to Seattle.<br/>
