                    <div class="plaintext-content">Why don't you put in your own new boxes with new clues?  (written in <br/>
an encouraging manner) It sounds as if you think the park LBworthy.  <br/>
Adopting boxes w/o permission is pretty presumptuous and is likely to <br/>
tick off the original placer.  Many of the original placers like <br/>
KangamangusdaBull and Eric the Ram don't frequent the List anymore, <br/>
so it's hard to get in contact with them. <br/>
<br/>
I have a whole theory on adoption of boxes.  I actually believe that <br/>
a letterbox and its clues are the intellectual property of its <br/>
placer.  Further I don't really believe that adopting a box preserves <br/>
the original integrity.  So if you do not have permission to adopt a <br/>
box, it's tantamount to stealing. I don't see the need to retain <br/>
boxes against the placer's wishes or capabilities.  Maybe, their <br/>
intention is to check on it every 5 years.  It's true that some boxes <br/>
will disappear, but there are also so many more to find.   Simply <br/>
plant your own box.  That way you don't step on anyone's toes, or <br/>
alter someone else's artisic offerings.  <br/>
<br/>
However, adoption and maintenance are different.  When you follow a <br/>
clue and find a box, you have been entrusted to preserve its intent.  <br/>
This shows that you appreciate the effort of the placer.  Further <br/>
gestures of appreciation include keeping a letterbox intact and dry <br/>
by repackaging properly, rehiding carefully, double bagging the log, <br/>
resealing the lid, making sure it remains a secret from "noxers", <br/>
contacting the placer, not giving shortcuts on the list, etc...  <br/>
Doing these things will increase the longevity of a letterbox, so <br/>
that future finders (and placers) will not be discouraged.<br/>
<br/>
BTW- The big push for adoption came when we switched over to the new <br/>
format (many Kudos to Wes and co.) and some of the placers weren't <br/>
aware of the new format.  Therefore in order to be included in the <br/>
new format some boxes were temporarily adopted until the the original <br/>
placers could be reached.  Some of those placers were grateful but <br/>
others were none-too-pleased about the adoptions.<br/>

&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone knew if Bulldog and The Ram were around<br/>
&gt; here. I went to find their Wolf Neck Woods Letterboxes today and<br/>
&gt; they were missing. Aparently they have been missing for a while. I<br/>
&gt; was hoping to get in contact with them to either let them know, or<br/>
&gt; ask if I could replace the boxes and adopt them for them. Anyone<br/>
&gt; have any ideas what I should do? The clues are really great and the<br/>
&gt; spots were wonderful, too. I feel there should be boxes there.<br/>

There certainly is more than enough park to place a few boxes!<br/>

<br/>
I would ditto other folks' advice and say that 4 might be a bit young for <br/>
finding somebody else's boxes.  You don't mention how large the group of children <br/>
will be or how many parents will be along to help supervise, or what hazards <br/>
might exist at the preserved gardens.  <br/>
<br/>
Having done this a bit with small groups of children, the youngest age I'm <br/>
comfortable working with is around 9 or so, because they're very capable of <br/>
understanding what's involved and able to get caught up in the spirit of it.  <br/>
That's not to say adults don't do it very successfully with very young children, <br/>
but it's usually more of a one-on-one situation and it's not really with a <br/>
"party" atmosphere.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought the idea of planting boxes yourself, either in your own yard if you <br/>
have one, or at a local park frequented by children was a great one.  You <br/>
could even decorate the box more along the lines of what might attract a young <br/>
child with stickers and such.  And given the attention span of a 4 year old, <br/>
you'd be a lot less likely to run into problems.  Tell the parents to have <br/>
everyone wear their absolute grubbies and they can all have fun stamping each other <br/>
to death.   You could put little prizes or tinkets in each box as well.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Let me offer a better suggestion- for your daughter's birthday take <br/>
HER letterboxing but skip taking a group of 4-year olds AND their <br/>
parents.  Letterboxing is not an activity in which you want to <br/>
involve a group of 20 people.  The point is to be unobserved, <br/>
unobtrusive &amp; remain somewhat secretive which is impossible to do <br/>
with a gaggle of small children.  <br/>
<br/>
I box with a 2 year-old &amp; 6-year old.  On occasion we take 1 of my 6-<br/>
year old's friends &amp; parents &amp; that is more than enough people in <br/>
the group.  Sometimes it seems like too many.  Young children tire <br/>
easily- &amp; while your child may have the stamina to go 2 hours, I <br/>
assure you that many of her friends will tire &amp; bore after the first <br/>
20 minutes causing frustration &amp; disappointment all around.  <br/>
<br/>
Your intentions are wonderful, but think it through- this has <br/>
gallactically bad idea written all over it.  If your daughter wants <br/>
to get her friends involved, invite them to join you one weekend, <br/>
one family at a time.  Some will join in your adventure, others <br/>
won't have any interest at all (don't take it personally).  But <br/>
letterboxing is not a party activity.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; I recently learned about letterboxing and I am planning my daughter's<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4-year-old birthday party. I know of two letterboxes at our<br/>
&gt; &gt; local preserved gardens<br/>
&gt; &gt; and my husband and I would like to introduce the children to<br/>
&gt; &gt; this art. Does<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone have any ideas or experiences they would like to share<br/>
&gt; &gt; for such a<br/>
&gt; &gt; celebration? I thought others might have done this with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; group of small children and<br/>
&gt; &gt; would have some input.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; BTW, I am not planning on having them carve personal stamps<br/>
&gt; &gt; with their<br/>
&gt; &gt; parents, however, since they are only 4 and the gathering<br/>
&gt; &gt; will only be for 2 hours.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They will each receive a log book and stamp when they arrive.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Please let me<br/>
&gt; &gt; know if you have any ideas about this. Thanks,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, let's see.<br/>
First of all, it helps to note that the LBNA website (where the clues <br/>
are hosted) is a different site from the talklist.<br/>
<br/>
For several years, when LB was in its early stages in the US, people <br/>
posted their new clues directly to the talklist.  This was the mode <br/>
of choice for dissemination of clues.  After the clues were posted, <br/>
some kindhearted webmaster would magically get them to appear on the <br/>
LBNA web page in the clue section.  If there was a change in the <br/>
clue, or it went missing, you had to notify the webmaster and they <br/>
would then need to make the changes for you.  So the website and the <br/>
talklist were intergral to each other.  However, as the number of <br/>
boxes increased, being a webmaster became a Herculean chore.  So Wes <br/>
(and some of his elves) created a new format in which members of LBNA <br/>
could post clues directly to the website, eliminating the data entry <br/>
chore for the webmasters and giving the job of maintining clues <br/>
directly to the placer.  There are also new search functions.  This <br/>
is how it is done now.  Over the course of a few months (I don't <br/>
remember exactly when, but I think it was around early spring <br/>
2003???) the new LBNA replaced the old LBNA and all of the boxes in <br/>
the old site needed to be transferred, this time by the <br/>
owners/placers, to the new LBNA.  Any boxes that were not transferred <br/>
were archived.  Some people became temporary caretakers of a box <br/>
until its owner was able to be notified.  This is also why we know <br/>
boxes have not been missing for years and years, maybe just 1, if at <br/>
all.  ;)  <br/>

Sometimes the placer quietly decides to let the box slide from public<br/>
view even though it is still well maintained (and visited).  Perhaps<br/>
the placement was a tribute to a loved one who passed away, and when<br/>
first placed the clues were posted on the LbNA site.  Then, as time<br/>
passed, the family chose for it to be a more personal box and not as<br/>
public as before.  So technically the box is alive and well, it just<br/>
*looks* abandoned with no viable contact information.    <br/>
<br/>
In a situation where the *abandoned* box is clearly maintained, I'd<br/>
say leave it but keep an eye on it.  Replace baggies, etc. if ever<br/>
needed, and if at any time it looks like it really is in decline, then<br/>
step in....but not until then.<br/>

This past weekend, I went to the first box I ever found while letterboxing.  <br/>
Butterfly had a copy of the clues (she has copies of almost EVERYTHING in CT <br/>
that she hasn't done), so we ventured out.  When we got to the box, it was out <br/>
in the open, lid off, no logbook, and totally filled with water to the point <br/>
that it was almost overflowing and the stamp was totally ruined.  We decided to <br/>
pull the box and contact the adopter on Butterfly's clues (not knowing that <br/>
it had been taken off of the LBNA clue site).  We were notified by the former <br/>
adopter that the planter had gotten ticked off at the adopter for adopting the <br/>
box.  Planter name was attempted to be changed back to the planter, and <br/>
somehow the clues fell off the face of the website (fairly long ago I found out).  <br/>
Needless to say, if the planter was THAT worried about their box, they would <br/>
have kept up with it's upkeep.  Now, I'm trying to locate the planter to find <br/>
out what to do with the box, and I can't.<br/>
<br/>
In closing, I feel as though it is important to try to keep up with boxes <br/>
that you plant, even if they are planted out of state.  I don't mean that the <br/>
planter needs to have it adopted on the site, but at least have someone in the <br/>
area of your box to go back and check on it periodically.<br/>
<br/>
OK.... I'll stop venting now<br/>
