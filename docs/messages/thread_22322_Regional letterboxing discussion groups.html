&gt;I live in Downingtown, am not on the mid-atlantic talk list - is it<br/>

There are a number of vibrant discussion groups for letterboxers in <br/>
regions across the US. Many of these have a very strong community <br/>
feeling, where plans for gatherings of all types (both full-fledged <br/>
traditional letterboxing gatherings, mini-gatherings and just a few <br/>
folks getting together for a day of hiking and letterboxing) are <br/>
hatched, mystery and word-of-mouth clues are distributed and general <br/>
letterboxing-related conversations are held.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my list of discussion groups related to letterboxing. Some <br/>
are not very active, but others are bustle with activity. Because <br/>
they're all on Yahoo, you can join them but choose not to receive <br/>
email and just read the messages on the group's web site.<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/links/?id=16<br/>
<br/>
In general, the regional groups (such as the Great Lakes, Pacific <br/>
Northwest, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Rocky Mountains) are <br/>
the first places you should go. Many of the more-localized or <br/>
state-based groups don't have as much activity (with exceptions such <br/>
as Texas and Northern/Southern CA).<br/>
<br/>
AtlasQuest.com also has message boards for states and regions, and <br/>
these are often good for local discussions.<br/>
