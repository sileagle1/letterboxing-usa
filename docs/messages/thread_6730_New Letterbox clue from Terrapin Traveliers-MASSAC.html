Fox in the Forest<br/>
<br/>
Location: Douglas,MA  County: Worcester<br/>
Date of Placement:  7/26/02<br/>
Placed By:  The Terrapin Traveliers<br/>
Rating: Hike is moderate to difficult.  Be sure to bring water, and remember <br/>
your route.  There were no trail maps to take along with you at the <br/>
trailhead.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Take Interstate 395 to exit number 2, then head towards Douglas.  Just past <br/>
the Indian Ranch Campground take the left and follow Route 16 towards <br/>
Douglas.  Travel 1.5 miles past the Douglas town line and find the trailhead <br/>
on your right (southside).  This is where you will begin your search.  You <br/>
can count the blazes or step the paces.<br/>
1.  Take heading of 240 degrees from the trailhead map.  You may NOT take <br/>
your motorized vehicle on the trail.<br/>
2.  330 paces follow as trail bears to the left.<br/>
3.  Dirt road, 23 paces to trail marker at right (total 10 blazes).<br/>
4.  At 450 paces, look for Mid-State Trail marker on left.  Follow trail to <br/>
the left (13 blazes).<br/>
5.  At 200 paces to the final clue (8 blazes)<br/>
6.  You will see a hallway made of two large boulders.  The correct rock is <br/>
the one that wears the blaze as its badge.  On it's south side you will find <br/>
a small pile of rocks--the fox is hiding beneath!<br/>
<br/>
Note to Letterboxing.org webmaster--please correct your posting for Terrapin <br/>
Traveliers--It is not Travelers (which is how it was posted), which may <br/>
cause confusion if someone attempts to e-mail us looking for information <br/>
regarding our clues.  Thank you for your help!<br/>
