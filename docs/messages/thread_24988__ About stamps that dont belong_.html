I think I would be upset if someone placed their stuff in my box.  But than again I am extremely new and if it's the way things are than I would not be upset.  <br/>

<br/>
You sign the hitchhiker into the box where you found it (if it isn't<br/>
already)<br/>
<br/>
Then you take it with you.<br/>
<br/>
You sign into the hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
You find another box it will fit in and sign it into that box and leave it<br/>
there for someone else  to find.<br/>

owners things were there but someone else added their own. <br/>

Hey Now, Heather!<br/>
<br/>
What you most likely found is a "Hitch Hiker":<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/articles/00000011.php  Just another twist<br/>
on the obsession.  Maddening, ain't it? :D<br/>

I think once you place something in the wild, it is no longer yours.<br/>
