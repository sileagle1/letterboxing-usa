with Ryan<br/>
and Amanda yesterday at Hop Brook .The Mcgiver Stove is truly a work <br/>
of art<br/>
and function in one . Jay Drew also was there and spending time with <br/>
Jay is<br/>
always a pleasure . Thanks to Beth for the Pizza , even if it was " <br/>
store<br/>
bought " ; ) ! Rubaduc " No ____ Sherlock " seems to have gone <br/>
missing and<br/>
I won't get it replaced in time for you to get as planned , Sorry .<br/>
We are really looking forward to the ME event taking place this Sat . <br/>
We<br/>
are camping in the park both Fri and Sat night . We will probably <br/>
arrive in<br/>
the area around noon or so on Fri and then be off to find some of the <br/>
new<br/>
boxes ( and some old ones we missed on our way through earlier in the<br/>
spring !! )in the area . I'll post with our site number ( hmmm... ) <br/>
later<br/>
in the week . If anybody want's to visit just come on by .<br/>
As for the SitRep thing , I think a good witch hunt is in order . If <br/>
we can just<br/>
track down who started the whole thing we could give them what they <br/>
got<br/>
coming to em ! How dare they . Using an unauthorized term .<br/>
Lets give them a good flaming . Really put them in there place !!<br/>
