All letterboxes are in Alum Rock Regional Park in San Jose.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxes for:<br/>
Alum Rock Regional Park<br/>
16240 Alum Rock Ave. <br/>
San Jose, CA 95127-1307 <br/>

<br/>
Mineral Baths Letter Box --<br/>
Follow the path along the sulfur hill. <br/>
Pass by the bridge, rotten-egg smell in the nostrils fill.<br/>
First "shrine" on your left, at the base on the right.<br/>
Move the stones, you'll find the box wedged in tight.<br/>
<br/>
"Ohlone Glade" Letter Box --<br/>
Follow the path along the sulfur hill.<br/>
Cross over the bridge, rotten smell in the nostrils fill.<br/>
Pass the Grove of Sycamore and Living Oak, <br/>
On to the look-out point where Ohlone once spoke.<br/>
Rest here and enjoy the view, <br/>
For a little more is all you do.<br/>
A few more steps to complete this test,<br/>
You'll find the box where trolls lie to rest.<br/>
<br/>
Eagle Rock Letter Box --<br/>
Find your way to the eagle's peak.<br/>
The most difficult to place, the most difficult to seek.<br/>
Face the trees and shrubs and rock.<br/>
On the right grows a tree of good stock.<br/>
To it's left the Rock with first crevice not too deep,<br/>
At it's base, under rock piled `round, a letterbox at the Eagle's <br/>
feet.<br/>
