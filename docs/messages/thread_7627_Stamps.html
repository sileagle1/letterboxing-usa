The way I look at carving is this:<br/>
I get an image (usually from clip art), transfer it to the carving medium (I<br/>
also recommend PZ Kut), then use sharp carving tools (available at hobby<br/>
stores) to remove everything that is not ink.<br/>
This may seem over simplified, but it works for me :-)<br/>
Remember, if you want to do words, place the image face down on the carving<br/>
medium &amp; trace it from the back of the paper. This will automatically flip<br/>
the words, so that when you stamp, it will come out correctly. If it's just<br/>
a picture, you can put the image (face up) over the carving medium &amp; tracing<br/>
paper &amp; trace the picture. I usually go over the tracing paper color with<br/>
ink, so I don't smear it during carving.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

<div>Inkjets wont work but copiers are perfect.  
You want to use a medium that requires heat to "cook" the toner onto the 
paper.  Any thermal transfer printing device will work.  Copiers, 
faxes, laser printers.  Inkjets and bubblejets dont use thermal toner and 
just "paints" the ink onto the paper.  It wont transfer over 
ironing.</div>

Hi, Sandi,<br/>
<br/>
I teach soft-block carving and have a really detailed online tutorial:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.ruthannzaroff.com/carving/carvinghow-to.htm<br/>
<br/>
I, too, LOVE PZ-Kut, even over the Mastercarve. There is a detailed<br/>
evaluation of all sorts of soft blocks, including where to get them, and<br/>
detailed instructions on various forms of image transfer.<br/>

<br/>Cool site! Thanks for the link. I just finished carving a new series I'm going to plant this weekend, and I wish I'd seen your site first. All of the stamps I've done thus far were carved with exacto knives, and I was just complaining to my wife about how I wished I had a tool with a smaller blade that I could control better. 
<br/>
<br/>Got to go get me one of those lino tools!
