                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to all who responded to my quest for a good map.  I've found what I was looking for, and quite please about it as well.  My family is from a town called Topsham which as it turns out is about 17 miles ENE of Dartmoor. Just south of Exeter.<br/>
<br/>
I am so there... I've even gotten dh and my boxing partner and her dh in on the deal... I was quite prepared to go it alone if I had to!<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many boxes one can reasonably hope to get during the average 8 hour day on the moor in late March early May?!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>

Dartmoor letterboxing is quite different from the US variety, so you should <br/>
do some studying up before you go. Their clues aren't "puzzles" as ours <br/>
are, but compass bearings and map coordinates. A sighting compass is <br/>
essential, along with the appropriate map before you go (it's available at <br/>
Amazon.co.uk). You need to be able to use the compass as well as figure out <br/>
the map quads in order to find the letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
One problem is that most Dartmoor clues aren't published online, but in <br/>
books and printed updates. However, to get a copy of one of the books, you <br/>
have to have found 100 Dartmoor letterboxes first and join the Dartmoor 100 <br/>
Club. Kind of a catch-22, but with some diligent searching (and perhaps <br/>
some help from some UK letterboxers) you can find some clues online. Be on <br/>
the lookout for "charity walks," too -- these are limited time letterbox <br/>
series that are planted to raise money from the purchase of a guide that <br/>
tells you where they are.<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of helpful websites (check those listed here on my site: <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/links_info.shtml), and if you contact the nice <br/>
people in the Dartmoor Letterboxing Club <br/>
(http://groups.msn.com/TheDartmoorLetterboxingClub) I'm sure they'll be <br/>
more than hospitable.<br/>
<br/>
Having said all of that, because there are between 5,000 &amp; 10,000 <br/>
letterboxes in Dartmoor NP, it's possible to find a whole lot in a single <br/>
day. Almost like Connecticut! <g><br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the info, I've spent the past couple of days researching lbxing in Dartmoor.  Thankfully in addition to going into my 30th year as a Girl Scout, I'm a leader and summer Camp program Director.  I've laid out 3 Letterboxing Program Special for Brownies, Juniors and Cadettes, all based on their Orienteering badges.  My stamp going to Dartmoor is Robert, Lord Baden-Powell, founder of Scouting in the UK.  It was his friendship and influence with William Boyce and Juliette Gordon Low that brought Scouting to the US.<br/>
<br/>
Compasses I got, maps I'll get, clues, now that's another story.  I've been told that there are a number of boxes in the pubs surrounding Dartmoor... now that's where the dhs come in... it's out bargaining tool to get them on the plane... beers=boxes, sounds like a fair equation to them LOL<br/>
<br/>
I've also been told that the phrase of the day is "Ask and ye shall receive"... I can only hope boxers around the world are as giving and sharing as here in the states.<br/>
<br/>
I've tried the links, but neither worked... I worked around the first, maybe I can manhandle the second...<br/>

The problem is that all messages are filtered through the Yahoo Groups<br/>
message board.  The program automatically 'wraps' all long sentences.<br/>
 It also converts all URLs to links.  Unfortunately, the interface<br/>
between these two sub-routines doesn't work well.  If it's a long URL,<br/>
it will wrap the bottom portion and then try to convert the first<br/>
portion to a link.  You have to manually go to the letterbox-usa yahoo<br/>
groups home page and click on the links from there.  Sorry. :(<br/>
