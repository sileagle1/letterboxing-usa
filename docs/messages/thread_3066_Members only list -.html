"members only"...most of my other lists are set up so that anyone can read<br/>
messages (and archived messages, too), but in order for someone to post to<br/>
the list, they have to "subscribe" to the list.  By 'subscribe' I don't mean<br/>
that the moderator has to approve membership (though that is possible, too,<br/>
I don't think it necessary here) -- it's an instant kind of thing.  Then<br/>
there is virtually no difference in the list than how it is now, except that<br/>
if someone does start flooding the list with spam, the moderator can remove<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
If there was someone who *really* didn't want to register with Yahoogroups<br/>
(which I believe you must do anyway to read the messages currently, no?) and<br/>
wanted to post clues, I'm sure that some kind soul would step up and would<br/>
post that clue to the list for them.  It could easily be another email<br/>
address on the website if necessary.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Count me as a "con" as well. I don't care for the exclusivity<br/>
&gt; of "members only" lists on yahoo. There's a cool bay area<br/>
&gt; (california) hiking list that I wanted to browse, but it is members<br/>
&gt; only and that was enough to turn me off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All of the other less-handy, old-fashioned lists I also subscribe to<br/>
&gt; are email only and members only, and frankly, they're cumbersome. I<br/>
&gt; enjoy the interaction but wish I had more options on how I'm<br/>
&gt; bombarded. Although I hate the advertising, the yahoo group format is<br/>
&gt; pretty flexible: people can set it up however they want.<br/>
