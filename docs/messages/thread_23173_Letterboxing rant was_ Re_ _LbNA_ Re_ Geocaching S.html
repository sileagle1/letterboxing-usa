                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been interested in lboxing for a couple of years.  I, in the beginning, whole heartily wanted to be a letterboxer, wanted to be known as a letterboxer and be known by letterboxers.  I have found out that I am too paranoid to really enjoy the hunt.  I am also not creative enough (or cannot let myself make the time to be creative enough) to make a good hunt for others.  I box and place as I wish, which this hobby allows but... I feel sympathy for the die hards.  You don't come in and go crazy lboxing, then die out... you are still here creating and hunting at the same level of enthusiasm.  I wish for you that you get to keep letterboxing as mysterious, challenging and creative as you want.  You really deserve it.  If that means I miss out on a whole bunch of really cool peoples letterboxes, oh well, you all deserve your private company.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails to a truely cool treasure hunting hobby... Fisher<br/>
