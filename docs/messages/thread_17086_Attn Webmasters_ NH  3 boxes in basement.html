                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Old Man box is listed as "unclaimed" and is in your basement, but it has been somewhat maintained, IIRC, because there was a second log, I'm pretty sure ...  Dan and I stamped in last summer.  On the same list there are Tuckerman's Ravine and Tuckerman's Ravine II.  The bottom box at Tuck's ("II") was not found when we looked for it on Labor Day.  However, the place was mobbed with climbers so someone may have had the box out of its spot to stamp-in in a more secluded place.  The upper one was right where it was supposed to be but has very, very little traffic.  It didn't need any maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
I think I tried to email the owners of Old Man and Tuck's I &amp; II, but I don't recall ever connecting with any of them.  I'll try again if I can figure out how to, because the clues are no longer where I can try "Contact the Placer" option. <br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, do boxes that are still out there and appear maintained need to be in the basement?  Just because the placers don't frequent the website doesn't mean that their boxes are abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when we return to the area we can recheck whatever boxes we can.  I can't see adopting something that isn't officially abandoned, but I don't mind foster parenting any box out there.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, Mary, you make a good point about the distinction <br/>
between "unclaimed" and "abandoned".  The first is a matter of fact:  <br/>
the placers have not followed through, for whatever reason, in <br/>
claiming the box on the new website.  But the second is difficult to <br/>
establish, short of obtaining a confirmation from the placer that <br/>
establishes 'no intent to continue its maintenance'.  I don't think <br/>
that a box should be adopted just because it 'appears' to be <br/>
abandoned;  one certainly could be mistaken about that. And yes, I <br/>
agree with the webmasters that unclaimed boxes should be segregated <br/>
in the letterbox-basement until claimed by the original placer or <br/>
adopted with consent thereof. The clues are available there for <br/>
anyone interested, and I'm looking hard at all those NY boxes! <br/>
Failing that, after a suitably long period, let them fade from the <br/>
scene.<br/>
