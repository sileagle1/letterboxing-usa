<br/>
Soooo just went I felt I had  thought of a great way for others to <br/>
enjoy the Halloween craziness of letterboxing.. an innovative idea <br/>
emerged from the FN3 organizers crew at our meeting this last week...<br/>
<br/>
Since a number of folks are coming for most of the weekend and<br/>
included in that group are some mystery folks....<br/>
<br/>
AND there are some folks who cant attend the MAINE EVENT of Fright on<br/>
Saturday....<br/>
<br/>
We decided "Lets Turn it UP a notch!"<br/>
<br/>
So at the behest of the Frightnight crew You will now see that the <br/>
Triple Crown of Fright is listed currently!<br/>
<br/>
That means <br/>
2 unique mini events are now wrapped around the Main event<br/>
Frightnight 3....SO we now have a Frightnight Weekend.........<br/>
<br/>
Sooooo the question is<br/>
<br/>
ARE YOU CRAZY ENOUGH!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Any questions please email me directly on yahoo or AQ......<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We appreciate everyone's contribution to this year's extravaganza and <br/>
past Frightnight events! This is our way to insure maximum enjoyment <br/>
for all!<br/>
