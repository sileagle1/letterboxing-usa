I've been busy carving again.  Say, Funhog...is there anywhere in that<br/>

Otherwise, I may plant it somewhere on one of those trails anyway.  I'm<br/>
pumped.  This will be a good time had by all!<br/>

Can you provide directions to the park and/or nearby trailheads? <br/>
Also, are you going to make an event stamp?<br/>
