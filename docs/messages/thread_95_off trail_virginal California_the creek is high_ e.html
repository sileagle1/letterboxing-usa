                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Deborah... one more condolence on behalf of your missing letterbox. <br/>
I wonder if it will reappear at some point?  Other than the carved<br/>
stamp, the contents are fairly worthless to the casual thief or<br/>
ne'r-do-well.  Maybe a stirring of concience will effect a change of<br/>
heart.  We discussed this very theme a few months ago during the brief<br/>
foray into the idea of cyberboxing.  We all made bold statements about<br/>
putting out boxes come what may &amp; I intend to stick to that. Personally,<br/>
I believe it is okay to hide the boxes a bit off trail... of course with<br/>
the idea that we are not hiding them on pristine, endagered soil or<br/>
anything.  I have been putting off hiding my Audubon series for this<br/>
very reason.  I am concerned that the local pine needle police might<br/>
look down their noses even though the forest duff that will be disturbed<br/>
by letterboxers will undoubtedly be significantly less than the<br/>
multitudes of runners using these trails.  Being the good boy scout, I<br/>
follow with the old tradition of leaving an area better than I found it<br/>
(my family think I am nuts as I patrol our campsites, picking up gum<br/>
wrappers &amp; cigarette butts that the 40-11 campers before me have left).<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately... use common sense!<br/>
<br/>
I regret to report that my Shasta #1 letterbox did not go to ground this<br/>
past weekend.  Other family activities, wet weather &amp; the short duration<br/>
of the visit made it tough to find time to get out.  I really wanted to<br/>
place the box in view of Mt. Shasta, since the stamp is a picture of<br/>
same.  I left the box with my sister with instructions for its placement<br/>
and clue construction.  Alas, California remains untouched by<br/>
letterboxes.  Hopefully soon... right?<br/>
<br/>
Oregon has tried again to wash away.  Ms. Nia (El Nio's twin sister)<br/>
is doing her best out here (of course we will take a little rain, rather<br/>
than the 5.2 earthquake that greeted us immediately upon arrival in<br/>
Redding, CA).  I have not been out to check the boxes because Rock Creek<br/>
came over the bank &amp; made it difficult to cross the bridge without<br/>
swimming or at least some serious wading.  Rock Creek #1's first hiding<br/>
spot was at least 2' underwater as of last Wednesday.  I believe the<br/>
current hiding spot for all 4 of our local boxes are high and dry.<br/>
<br/>
end report <br/>

Never fear, Thom, I'm sure your letterbox will find a good home in due time.<br/>
I've been to Mt. Shasta a couple of times, and I absolutely love the area.<br/>
There's something magical about it that I can't explain.  Mt. Hood doesn't<br/>
affect me nearly the same way as Shasta.  Maybe I'm just loopy?  I will<br/>
definitely go hunting for any letterboxes you hide near Mt. Shasta.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, despite all the holiday activity, it seems a lot of letterboxes were<br/>
placed around the country this weekend.  I think it may have been a record-<br/>
setter!!  I managed to get two of them out, although my clues will be in the<br/>
form of a map, which I have not quite completed... stay tuned.<br/>
<br/>
My new boxes are, again, near Rock Creek and are suitable for families with<br/>
young children.  I had a spot chosen for one a week ago, but procrastinated...<br/>
good thing because the flooding that Thom mentioned would have left it well<br/>
below the water line!!  As a result, I explored a bit more and found a drier<br/>
spot that I like even more!!!<br/>
<br/>
I'll try and get my map ready by tomorrow night at the latest.<br/>
