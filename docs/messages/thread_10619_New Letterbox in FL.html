<br/>
<br/>Location:  Quiet Waters Park
<br/>401 S. Powerline Road
<br/>Deerfield Beach FL
<br/>Broward County
<br/>
<br/>Difficulty:  easy (about 0.2 mile round trip from parking)
<br/>This follows  "Mid-Atlantic" letterboxing customs:  you will need to bring your own ink pad and pen.

<br/>Planted by D and Shoo, January 30, 2003
<br/>
<br/>We figured all you Florida residents were jealous of all the snow we were getting up north, so we planted a letterbox with snowflakes falling in Florida!
<br/>
<br/>Quiet Waters Park has camping, water activities (in season), a marina, and more!  There is an admission charge on weekends and holidays ($1 per person), but it is free on weekdays.
<br/>
<br/>To get to the letterbox, drive to the camping area.  Park in the first campground parking lot (by sites 1-4).  Take the paved trail past sites 1-3 through the woods to a large clearing.  You will see two white posts that once apparently held a sign.  Stand between those posts and take a compass reading of 150 degrees.  Follow that direction to the edge of the clearing and you will find a fallen V log.  What you seek is in the V of the log.
<br/>
<br/>If the posts get removed, go to the palm tree in the middle of the clearing.  Stand on the side of the palm tree facing the direction where the trail enters the clearing.  Take a compass reading of 255 degrees to find the fallen V log.
<br/>
<br/>Since we won't be back to Florida for a while, we would appreciate anyone's maintenance of this box as needed.
