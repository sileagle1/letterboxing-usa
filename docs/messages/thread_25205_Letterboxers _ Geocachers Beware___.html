                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can agree but disagree with this site, for the simple fact that he does have a point, some folks who letterbox and geocache are not observant of their surroundings. I have met a few in my travels that do litter and don't care about the environment, they just care about finding the box. I have seen much damage around letterboxes, I personally have tried fixing what damage is possible, but anything helps right? Now because one person is out to get all these boxes, we shouldn't get mad or even upset. There are tons of us who no matter how many of our boxes are stolen or damaged we will continue to plant and search for those that are already taken. I stand strong in my ways of planting and finding. Its a great and healthy way to get outdoors and GET MOVING! If I do ever meet this guy all I would do is stop and smile and ask him how his find was. I would not flip out on him, or even say anything bad to him. This would bother them more then badmouthing them. <br/>
<br/>
So if they consider our boxes trash, let them. They are treasures to us, and I know we hate having our stuff stolen, but if we keep dwelling on it then they are getting what they want. <br/>
<br/>
Keep your heads up and enjoy the outdoors, whether or not you find the box you're looking for. Hope this helps some annoyed people, happy hunting!<br/>

<br/>
The best response to cache maggots is to ignore them, so posting topics about them is counterproductive. Ignore them, replace the containers when they are stolen, and they go away eventually. When they dont, arrest them for stealing, like what happened to Paul Repak: <br/>
<br/>
http://romesentinel.com/news?newsid=20100217-141107<br/>
<br/>
(Whether the charges stick or not is moot. Hes been publicly embarrassed which is punishment enough)<br/>
<br/>
Many of the caches stolen were placed with permission by the land managers, so this person has no argument worth sharing. They really dont have a point since they arent taking the high road with their arguments. We all know sugar is bad for you but we dont go around taking candy from babies.<br/>
<br/>
I figure that the cache maggot (or box maggot) is likely monitoring this list to see what kind of reactions they get from stealing caches and letterboxes. They arent really worth your time and energy, so I would suggest not feeding them.<br/>

Two thoughts come to mind:<br/>
<br/>
A - Here in the desert we would call what this person is doing theft. I would doubt that many would stand for it. Ammo cans are not cheap around here!<br/>
<br/>
B - I noted the beautiful scenery in that anonymous bloggers pictures. How did they get such beautiful photos without "tramping all over the sensitive ecosystem"?<br/>
<br/>
Going back to my box now.....<br/>
