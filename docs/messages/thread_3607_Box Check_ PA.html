Wow! Sure does get dark early with the time change<br/>
here on the east coast!! Checked on three of my<br/>
Delaware Canal letterboxes during the trip home <br/>
from work today. All are dry and in very good<br/>
condition. Two, "Lock 21" and "Gold Fish" are waiting<br/>
for their first visitors.  "Have Bike Will Travel" <br/>
has alittle adventure to share... The Park system is<br/>
going to great lengths to preserve the history of <br/>
the canal and alot of rebuilding is going on. "Have<br/>
Bike.." was hidden under a board of a bridge between<br/>
the canal and the Delaware River, a tight squeeze <br/>
and maybe alittle iffy, but I had already checked on<br/>
it once after planting and all was well. This<br/>
afternoon I was very surprised as I walked up to it's<br/>
location to see that a "new" wooden bridge had<br/>
replaced the previous, (one that had looked perfectly<br/>
good to me..), I thought, Oh well...one box down the<br/>
drain! Too bad I thought, I liked that stamp, but when<br/>
I reached down to see if there was any space to<br/>
possibily plant a replacement, there was the box!!<br/>
Whoever rebuilt the bridge had found the box and when<br/>
finished had tucked it back in, with more space and<br/>
better coverage...wow! Bless their open minded <br/>
hearts!!<br/>
Whoever and wherever you are, thankyou.<br/>
'Box On! Live Well<br/>
