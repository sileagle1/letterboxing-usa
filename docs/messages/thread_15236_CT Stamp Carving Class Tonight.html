tonight.  Eight of the 9 people in the class were letterboxers!!  What fun <br/>
meeting other people with this same obsession!!<br/>
<br/>
The best part was - we got our first 2 exchanges, and one more will be coming <br/>
in the mail!!!  The other planners in the group (those of us who thought to <br/>
bring our exchange stamps) were Green Heron and Rubber Soul.  Martha (the M in <br/>
JAM) promised to send us her stamp in exchange for ours.<br/>
<br/>
It really is a small community we play in.  Martha and her friend Jan (the J <br/>
in JAM) found the first hitchhiker that Tom and I released.  I carved it in <br/>
honor of Tom's 50th birthday and released it on his birthday (July 11th).  Jan's <br/>
birthday is also July 11th.  I guess she was a little spooked - and a lot <br/>
excited about it.  But, we didn't get to meet the J tonight, just the M!!  Maybe <br/>
we'll hook up on the trail sometime.<br/>
