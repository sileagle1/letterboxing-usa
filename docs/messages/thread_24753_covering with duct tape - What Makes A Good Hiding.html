&gt; more obvious, but that those choices seem like a poor cover-ups for <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; poor hiding spot. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you have to do that much to cover it up, then perhaps it begs the<br/>
&gt; question of whether or not it is a suitable hiding spot for a box, <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; perhaps you ought to look for another one. Once you've taken the <br/>
time<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree completely with Silver Eagle.  Perhaps covering a box, bag or pouch begs the question...what geographic area is the planter/box located?  I live in an area that is primarily prairie, with much of my county and surrounding counties in farm acreage.  It would be wonderful to have State and National Parks available for boxing; unfortunately, farmland does not lend itself to letterboxing.  We boxers in this area use what we have...cemeteries, community parks/playgrounds, and a few areas of local prairie preserves.  If you "get off the beaten path" in a prairie preserve you will find...more grasses!  If we don't use duct tape and camo tape, our boxes are prime targets for vandalism.<br/>
I beg the question, phyto, if you stood outside your door and could see only farm acreage for ten miles (supposing you could see at a distance of ten miles) what would you choose for a hiding place?  We use what we have available.<br/>
