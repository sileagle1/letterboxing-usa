<br/>
I got my copy (the 1999 edition) of the Joshua's Trust book directly <br/>
from:<br/>
<br/>
Joshua's Tract Conservation and Historic Trust<br/>
PO Box 4<br/>
Mansfield Center, CT 06250<br/>
(860) 429-9023<br/>
<br/>
This organization is truly a gem and a worthwhile cause. The book is <br/>
nearly 300 pages (287 to be exact) and is ONLY about $9.00. The <br/>
proceeds benefit the Trust. <br/>
<br/>
The book is easily available throughout the "Joshua's" towns of <br/>
Ashford, Chaplin, Columbia, Coventry, Eastford, Franklin, Hampton, <br/>
Lebanon, Mansfield, Scotland, Willinton and Windham and Tolland. (And <br/>
Mystic's Denison Nature Center, too!)<br/>
<br/>
The folks at the Trust are friendly and quite helpful. Also, if you <br/>
get the book directly from them, you may get a really nifty decal for <br/>
your car with the Joshua's Trust logo on it! Membership to the Trust <br/>
is also available at $10/year.<br/>
<br/>
Please consider *paying* for the book; it's not alot when you <br/>
consider the treasures it contains.<br/>
<br/>
