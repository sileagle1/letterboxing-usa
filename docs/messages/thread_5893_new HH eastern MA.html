                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have just returned from nine days of "work" in New England. Luckily, I<br/>
managed to squeeze in letterboxing all along the way, some boxes left, some<br/>
found. A Funhog has its priorities after all. The Perambulating Pig Hitch<br/>
Hiker was dropped off in eastern MA and is waiting for a friendly visitor.<br/>
I was consistently surprised by how LARGE the stamps were, much bigger than<br/>
most of the others I have in my book from out west. I was also surprised by<br/>
the number of store bought stamps I saw, both as signature stamps and in<br/>
the boxes. Prior to this trip I had found 103 boxes and all but 3 of them<br/>
had handmade stamps!<br/>
Following in the footsteps of Boxer Extraordinaire, Ryan C. from Portland,<br/>
0regon I carved a new signature stamp after finding 100 letterboxes. This<br/>
trip was the maiden run for the updated Hog. Many thanks to Tom Cooch, Doc<br/>
Science, GJ Journeys, Yellow Kitty, Lonemasswolf, Drew Clan, Leader of the<br/>
Pack and the Chatham HS Gals, WingClippedHeron, and Buckaroo for an excuse<br/>
to slog through mud, commune with deer ticks and to get sand between my<br/>
toes. Funhog<br/>
