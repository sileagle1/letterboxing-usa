                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a day we had!!  Started at the Bozrah boxes.  Both are in great <br/>
shape, the 2nd one took us a while to find the right stone wall, but <br/>
we did it!! The broken heart box in the Johnson cemetery was very <br/>
interesting- such a sad piece of history!! But the most amazing part <br/>
of our day was at the Hoffman Evergreen Preserve.  We were after the <br/>
Metamorphosis series and the Drewclan Evergreen boxes,too.  The 3rd <br/>
Met.. box wasn't where it was supposed to be- next to a pond in a <br/>
hollow of a tree.  Instead it was floating in the middle of the <br/>
pond.  The amazing,letterboxing, retriever, the Toad Dog, responded <br/>
to his master's command, and swam in and brought it back to shore!! <br/>
What a sight!!! There's a picture of him back on shore with it in his <br/>
mouth if you check out the photos under boxing doggies. The contents <br/>
were damp, but not totally trashed--amazing!!!! A very successful <br/>
week of boxing with a truly fabulous ending.  Happy Boxing Everyone--<br/>
Sunshine, Swamp Yankee, and the ever amazing Toad Dog  :0)      <br/>
