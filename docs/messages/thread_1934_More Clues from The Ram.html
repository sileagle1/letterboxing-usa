<br/>
Clue: Easty<br/>
Hike: Moderate<br/>
1 to 2 hours on a 3 mile max round trip<br/>
<br/>
    Did you find Little Dam?<br/>
    Look not far from that if you can,<br/>
    for three treasures with views here in this plan.<br/>
<br/>
Begin by finding where the Narragansett Trail follows Ryder Road. When the <br/>
trail turns into the woods, you'll find a spot where you can tie your steed. <br/>
Start here and follow the trail UP.... stop, remember to breathe, it's okay, <br/>
it's a good warmup, you'll be fine for the rest of the hike.<br/>
You'll reach a bit of a landing and continue along the trail with an only <br/>
slightlly obscured view of the valley below. Soon you will come to a large <br/>
ourcrop of rock on your left where the trail runs in front of it. You'll have <br/>
to make a decision here. You can either go between the rock and the tree or <br/>
between the trunks. Either way, it's a bit of a Tight Squeeze. Your first <br/>
treasure will be foundEspecially for an 11 year old boy scout on his first <br/>
hike with an overloaded backpack (memories).<br/>
