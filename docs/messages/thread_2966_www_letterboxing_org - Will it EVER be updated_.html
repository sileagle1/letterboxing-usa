If the Letterboxing.org folks spent less time with their family and friends<br/>
giving them more time to work on the www.letterboxing.org site these newbies<br/>
wouldn't be confused. Time these folks got their priorities straight! Maybe<br/>
they ought to PAY US to go to the site. Yes, they should sell all their<br/>

their desire to edify me and I thank them one and all.<br/>

Enjoy CT.  I was born and raised there, and the current heat wave <br/>
should be enough to prevent you from wanting to go back for a while.  <br/>
A pity you couldn't see it in the fall.  It can be breathtaking.<br/>
