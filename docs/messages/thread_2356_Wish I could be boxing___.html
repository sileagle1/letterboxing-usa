and kids' soccer schedules I haven't had much time for 'boxing.  I <br/>
did take my Brownie troop to Fisherville Brook for their first LB <br/>
outing.  They had a great time finding the Knight and the Mummy (no <br/>
time for Renee).  Fisherville Brook is close to where we live and I <br/>
was surprised that only two out of fifteen kids had been there <br/>
before.  Hopefully we will get a few new converts to letterboxing <br/>
from the outing.<br/>
<br/>
I have several boxes ready and waiting to be planted with more on the <br/>
drawing board.  Still waiting for someone to decipher Trish's Twist.  <br/>
