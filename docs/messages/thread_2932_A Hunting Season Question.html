Fowl season begins in the first weekend in October, same as bow <br/>
season for game animals and upland birds. It's not law to wear safety <br/>
orange at this time, but it's a good idea. Then, shotgun season for <br/>
deer opens first Saturday in November, and runs though New Years. You <br/>
must where orange then. Rifles are only allowed by special permit on <br/>
private land. No hunting on Sundays in CT, as Chip noted. I think <br/>
Sunday hunting is also banned in Mass, NH and Maine, but I know it IS <br/>
legal in VT. And there is no hunting at night either.<br/>
<br/>
In CT, hunting happens in designated areas (WMAs) and on private <br/>
land, and it is usually posted with "warning, hunting is permitted" <br/>
signs. I noticed these at Bear Rock in Durham. But to be on the safe <br/>
side, always where some blaze orange from September until January, <br/>
and talk constantly while out in the woods. And don't forget to put <br/>
something orange on Paddy!<br/>
<br/>
If by chance you see someone engaged in any illegal hunting or <br/>
fishing practice, such as un-tagged deer (a postcard sized tag <br/>
usually hung on antler or ear), or hunting in no-hunting areas, or on <br/>
Sundays or at night, then call 1-800-842-HELP, a 24 hour toll free <br/>
line to the CT DEP Law Enforcement Division. Note the violation, <br/>
time, date, vehicle, plate #, and physical description of the <br/>

<br/>
The season is different in every state -- sometimes widely different. Bow<br/>
season for deer starts in mid-September in NH, not until October in VT. It<br/>
may open even earlier in some other states. Some states allow old fashioned,<br/>
muzzle-loaded rifles to be used at the beginning of the season, others at<br/>
the end. There are seasons for things like squirrel and  rabbit that start<br/>
earlier. Many states have no closed season on some species (such at coyote),<br/>
so it is possible (though unlikely) you could encounter a person with a gun<br/>
at any time of year.<br/>
<br/>
In most states, hunting is allowed anywhere it is NOT specifically posted as<br/>
unallowed. Unless you specifically see postings for "No Hunting," you should<br/>
assume that you could be in the company of hunters.<br/>
<br/>
Hunting on Sundays is allowed in NH.<br/>
<br/>
Deer "tags" (the marker a hunter puts on a deer as soon as it is killed) are<br/>
also different in every state. Some states use an actual tag (like a paper<br/>
luggage tag), many others use a small sticker that is usually placed on the<br/>
ear or lower lip. Seasons for does and bucks are diferent in every state as<br/>
well. What weapons can be used is different in every state (no special<br/>
permission needed in NH, VT, ME to use a rifle, as opposed to a shotgun) <br/>
The requirement to wear bright orange is also different in every state.<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to know, any sporting goods store in your area will have<br/>
copies of your state's hunting and fishing regulations available. They are<br/>
all available on line, too.<br/>
<br/>
Just to put a little reality check on this, hunting is a safer activity than<br/>
most other outdoor activities. More people die doing things like skiing or<br/>
sailing than are injured in hunting accidents (it's just that hunting<br/>
accidents usually make the nightly news). It is wise to dress appropriately<br/>
when there are hunters in the woods (wear some orange...do not wear or carry<br/>
anything white), but don't let hunting season keep you out of the woods. <br/>

The problem stems from the fact that we here on the<br/>
east coast are in range of where the puritans stepped<br/>
foot on a little rock in a big ocean near Plymouth,<br/>
ma.<br/>
You should see the "rock" they have surronded by a<br/>
wrought iron fence, it's rather laughable to think a<br/>
ship pulled up that far inland. But anyways these<br/>
puritans set up laws, some of which are actually still<br/>
on the books today (you can't bathe with a pig on<br/>
Sunday's). These laws are prohibitive "Blue Laws", as<br/>
alcohol can't be bought in Connecticut after 8 p.m. or<br/>
on Sundays, hunting cannot be performed on Sundays,<br/>
the only thing permitted, even up untill the 70's in<br/>
connecticut, was the attendance of church. I can<br/>
remember as a child in the 70's wanting to do things<br/>
on Sunday, but nope, blue laws have the places closed.<br/>
It seems like they loved to roll up the sidewalk at 7<br/>
p.m. on Saturday night, and unroll it again at 6:30 am<br/>
on Monday.<br/>
<br/>
That's New England for you!<br/>
