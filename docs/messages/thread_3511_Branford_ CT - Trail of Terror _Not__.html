<body>Hi Everyone,
<p>About the Supply Pond (Trail of  Terror)
clues - guess the third box is a hard one!!  I could rewrite the clues,
but it really isn't that difficult to find.  Colin had no problem
when I took him through.  As far as standing at the tree - you know,
I don't remember if I was facing the tree or not.  The best thing
I have found in those situations is to do it from all directions. 
After all, you may only be wrong three times and it is a short 14 steps. 
At least you don't have to retrace steps for miles - which I have done
on occasion!  I think I will leave it the way it is for a while -
if people continue to have a lot of trouble - then I will rewrite or move
the third box.  After all, it shouldn't be THAT easy and I think this
makes up for boxes I was desperately hunting!  (Drew Clan - payback
is delicious!).

ALL!"

Maybe I'm not understanding this, but aren't these<br/>
compass bearings, and therefore while standing at the<br/>
tree you would find north, and travel 270 degrees from<br/>
north?  That would be the same no matter what side of<br/>
the tree you were on.<br/>

<body>Lisa,
<p>UMMMMMMMMM  Most excellent point!! 
And it's 250 degrees - not 270 degrees!

Its sort of a miracle that we've been able to find several other boxes in<br/>
the past month using the wrong approach.<br/>
<br/>
We'll go back with a compass this week for that third one.<br/>

Thanks Lisa!<br/>
