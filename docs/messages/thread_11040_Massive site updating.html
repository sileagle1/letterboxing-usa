                    <html><body>Whew! After a great trip to sunny California I think we've caught up with all the web hosting chores that built up. Over the last couple of days, we've uploaded 52 files to the letterboxing.org site. If your recent letterboxes for ct, ma, pa, dc, ca, az, nm, ut, and nv aren't done as you would like, please let Margaret and I know. Most of us webmasters use the whatsnew page, 
<br/>
<br/>http://www.letterboxing.org/lbna/whatsnew.htm
<br/>
<br/>as a to-do list, so if your stuff isn't done you can always look to see if it's been swept into that big pile. That way at least you know we're aware of it.

<br/>
Yeah, that sunny thing can be nice sometimes.  =)<br/>
<br/>
I looked around to make sure all my boxes are displayed <br/>
appropriately, and I could only find one mistake.  The Mexican Hat <br/>
letterbox has shown up in New Mexico, but it's really located in <br/>
Utah.  Other than being in the wrong state, though, it all looks <br/>
good!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the hard work!<br/>
