1724 in the wilderness of the Colonies.<br/>

"Damn good brandy!"<br/>
"And you thought camping with a surveyor would be uncivilized. Come. <br/>
Let me show you the secret around these parts. And the more brandy <br/>
you have the better you can see it. ... That hill yonder. See the <br/>
moat that swirls around its base? See among the trees its crown of <br/>
crumbling stones?"<br/>
<br/>
Straining to focus his misty eyes they slowly widened in wonder.<br/>
<br/>
1999 on the Orange line.<br/>
<br/>
Between West Falls Church and Balston I like to look north from the <br/>
train for the window cut through a chimney. Looking south one day in <br/>
the leafless winter, just east of East Falls Church, I saw a sharp <br/>
hill rising out of the middle of suburbia. "What is that?" <br/>
I gathered the troops: 9 year old boys and a girl armed with souvenir <br/>
flintlocks from DisneyWorld and wooden swords from the Renaissance <br/>
Faire. Crossing what looked like the remnants of a moat we stormed <br/>
the summit. In victory we examined the peak's crags of orangish rock. <br/>
Our minds spinned into...<br/>
<br/>
1366 A.D.<br/>
<br/>
All around us were the reddish orange battlements. Below lay large <br/>
pieces of the fallen tower, once gleaming of white quartz. <br/>
"What smells of elderberries?"<br/>
"You Father. Ever since lunch. Can we get a hamster?"<br/>
"Ask your Mother."<br/>
Suddenly the trojan rabbit hurled itself over the battlements. <br/>
Sprinting northeast down the path it jumped on a chunk of white tower <br/>
quartz stuck in the path. Puzzled, rabbit pulled from its waistcoat a <br/>
watch, or possibly a compass, and dashed off at 120 degrees. Only to <br/>
stop short on a another white rock. White Rock? Don't they make <br/>
ginger ale? Looking nervous and late rabbit dashed off again at 60 <br/>
degrees leaping some 40 giant steps to a very large tree. Also a very <br/>
small tree. Between them rabbit furtively searched under a six inch <br/>
square chunk of orange battlement and flashing its tale, <br/>
surreptitiously vanished.<br/>
"Curiouser and curiouser," I remarked.<br/>
"Because she's made of wood?"<br/>
"Ni!"<br/>
We walked down the hill to the Roman road to read all about it.<br/>
<br/>
Later as I pondered over brandy our adventures, the more I pondered <br/>
the more I came to believe we had found the ghostly ruins of a castle <br/>
lost in mists. May I recommend Irish Mist? <br/>
