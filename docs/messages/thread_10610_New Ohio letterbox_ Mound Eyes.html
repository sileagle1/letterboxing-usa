                    <div class="plaintext-content">Title: "Mound Eyes". Location: Great Seal State Park, near <br/>
Chillicothe,Ohio.(Ross County).Difficulty: Easy. Placed 2-2-03 by <br/>
Salamander. The title of this letterbox was inspired by a friend's <br/>
story of a great hiking trail he often walked on. It took me awhile <br/>
to discover he had actually been saying "Mt. Ives" and not "Mound <br/>
Eyes". You will not be on the Mt. Ives trail on this quest, but in <br/>
the same general area. CLUES: Go to the Ireland Picnic Area <br/>
playground. Starting at the westernmost leg of the (metal-framed) <br/>
swingset,go 17 paces at a heading of 262 degrees (1 pace=2 steps).You <br/>
should find yourself standing beside a cedar tree. From here,go 11 <br/>
paces at 225 degrees. Stop. From this point you will be able to see a <br/>
bright yellow, man-made object at a heading of 260 degrees. Go to <br/>
that object. From the object, if you take 14 paces at 217 degrees, <br/>
you can find the Mound Eyes letterbox hidden under a fallen log.<br/>
