A few weeks ago a letterboxer from Brown County (Ohio) area informed me<br/>
that the New Hope CB letterbox was missing .<br/>
He also said  that he had taken a digital camera pic and no letterbox<br/>
was seen.<br/>
(I hope you are subscribing <br/>
to the talk list )<br/>
<br/>
Well letterboxers there is "New Hope"... another boxer has just<br/>
confirmed that the letterbox is there with a pic showing the light blue<br/>
box and a clear plastic lid.<br/>
But she thinks it has fallen down a bit from its original position.<br/>
" Hopefully " not out of reach !!  <br/>
<br/>
The camera pic was a lifesaver ! Thanks <br/>
