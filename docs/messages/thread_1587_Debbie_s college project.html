drewclan letterboxes as well. If you wouldn't mind, it might be best <br/>
to just list the links to our "mystery" boxes, and not try to cut-and-<br/>
paste the clues or make maps to them (thanks!). It's probably easiest <br/>
to get those right off our own website at:<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also have another request to anyne who has placed letterboxes in <br/>
eastern CT. I'm making a website for a college internet class, it's <br/>
all about letterboxing. I think it's coming out really well. I hope I <br/>
don't step on anyones toes the Letterboxing .org is a great site. I <br/>
just wanted to localize it. I've been working on the research since <br/>
October, and have been working on the actual site for a few weeks. <br/>
The problem is that I don't want to duplicate anyones clues without <br/>
their permission, that's plagerism and my prof. would have a cow. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Future plans for the site include a road map with a mark placed<br/>
&gt; hopefully in the parking lot, helping people find their way easier. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also I've written a page for missing letterboxes, links to related<br/>
&gt; sites, (including letterboxong.org), and a FAQ page.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please e-mail me and let me know which boxes that you've planted <br/>
that I can and can't use on the site. I'll place the e-mail in my <br/>
portfolio for school. Thanks for putting so much out there, I know <br/>
that I'll never finish, but I'm taking internet 2 in the spring.<br/>
&gt; Thanks again, Debbie<br/>
