                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>With a rare weekend off, we seized upon the excellent weather in New England to visit some of the newer boxes in northern CT. 
<br/>
<br/>Hartland Blue Trail Letterboxes: Sleeping Giant and Rocky Brook were both in excellent shape. The Rocky Brook was more like a Rocky Trail. &lt;g&gt;
<br/>
<br/>The Streams of Living Waterbox: Easy in and out, even with the fields full of future soccer stars.
<br/>
<br/>Three Furry Friends: The pond here was almost completely dried up. I think it's one of the saddest things out on the trail that I've seen in a long time. It's clear from the trails (bridges, dams, etc.) that this was once a rather large pond. As for the boxes, the walk was easy, three cute little stamps, good clues. Just missed another group of boxers who came before us, so we missed out on getting that first "X" again.
