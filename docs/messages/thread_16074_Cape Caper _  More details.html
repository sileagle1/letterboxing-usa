on the "Upcoming Events" information page about the Cape Caper.  <br/>
Someone suggested that I also post it here so that some folks who <br/>
might decide at the last minute to come will see it.  Here goes:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi again folks.  The Yachtsman, Mary Manatee, Tweety &amp; Mr. Coon spent <br/>
a day at Nickerson State Park yesterday (Sep 26) planting boxes and <br/>
generally arranging the details for the Caper.  We will be camping at <br/>
area 7 in the back of the park, and hence the park supervisor has <br/>
agreed to let us set up our event tables at the parking lot for area <br/>
7.  We will have two large screen tents, tables, and a tarp set up to <br/>
cover all in case of inclement weather.  It would be a good idea to <br/>
bring some folding chairs if you want to sit, because we may only <br/>
have two tables with benches.  The permanent boxes are set out at <br/>
various places within the park (and off course in surrounding nature <br/>
friendly areas).  In addition there will be a 5 - box day only series <br/>
of stamps that will be set out around the area 7 campground.  We <br/>
chose to set up in this area because many of the other scenic areas <br/>
in the park have already closed their bathrooms for the season.  <br/>
There will be restrooms within easy walking distance of our gathering <br/>
site.  PLEASE NOTE:  We did not tell the park supervisor that we are <br/>
a "letterboxing" group because we were not sure whether or not he <br/>
would welcome such activities.  Hence if you have to ask for <br/>
directions, please tell him you are looking for the Cape Caper.  We <br/>
told him that we are a group of hikers and bikers that are meeting to <br/>
have fun in the park.  There will be a sign at the entrance directing <br/>
you to the correct place.  There is no fee to get into the park for <br/>
day use.<br/>
<br/>
So come one and all and partake of the festivities.  The event will <br/>
begin at 10 am, with the food and stamp exchange around noon, and <br/>
will continue till about 4 pm.  We will have one or several propane <br/>
stoves for heating things in pots, and one portable gas grill if you <br/>
want to really cook something.  Otherwise bring salads, sweets or <br/>
finger foods as you like.  We will provide cold drinks, plates, and <br/>
utensils.  Hope to see you there.<br/>
<br/>
