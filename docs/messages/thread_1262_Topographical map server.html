IMO, you get to count the hithchhker for your F's, but not for your <br/>
P's, unless you're the one who created it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was looking up information about hikes in Connecticut, and I <br/>
happened upon a site that will generate topographical maps for the <br/>
entire United States!  The link is below:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.topozone.com<br/>
<br/>
You can choose from four different scales  (1:25,000, 1:50,000, <br/>
1:100,000, 1:200,000), and three different sizes (small, medium, <br/>
large).  And the maps are in color!  I was able to generate a map of <br/>
the area around my property, bordering Devil's Hopyard State Park.  I <br/>
can use this to practice orienteering.  I didn't read much about it, <br/>
but I'm assuming that north on this map is true north, rather than <br/>
magnetic north.  It seems like it would have to be, since the <br/>
magnetic declination can vary from year to year.  <br/>
<br/>
To see the map I generated, click the link below:<br/>

I just thought this might be nice for some of you serious hikers.  <br/>
And for those of you that are curious to see areas you recently <br/>
hiked, from a topographical perspective.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, did I mention, the site is FREE?  That's the best part.  <br/>
<br/>
This past weekend I found two letterboxes, plus the 'Boxcar' <br/>
hitchhiker, in Scotland, CT.  I'll likely hide the Boxcar on my next <br/>
jaunt.  I guess that means I'm at P0F5 (placed none, found five)!  <br/>
Just out of curiosity, if one hides a hitchhiker, does one count that <br/>
as placed?  I wouldn't think so, but I was just curious.  <br/>
<br/>
My wife and I are hoping to place our first letterbox up in Nova <br/>
Scotia in a few weeks.  We're going up there on vacation, and would <br/>
love to be the first listed letterbox in Nova Scotia.  We're also <br/>
going to Prince Edward Island for a day, but we don't want to be too <br/>
ambitious.  <br/>

<br/>
I agree with Tom: you can "find" a hitchhiker, but you only "place" <br/>
the ones you create. We've seen a one of our own hitchhikers (boxcar) <br/>
while we were out checking on letterboxes, but we left it where it <br/>
was for someone else to find. Then, recently, we discovered another <br/>
of our own (Airstream) while searching for cockadoodle-moo <br/>
letterboxes, and we were so thrilled and surprised that we took it. <br/>
We haven't added it in to our "found" score yet, but the discovery <br/>
was so fun that we thought of counting it as both "placed" <br/>
and "found."<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations on your growing count! Hope to get up to Nova Scotia <br/>
next summer, so am looking forward to your clues.<br/>
