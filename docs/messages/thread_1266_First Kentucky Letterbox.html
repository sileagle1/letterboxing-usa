Kentucky First Letterbox clues<br/>
Red River Gorge area of the Daniel Boone National Forest. <br/>
It takes approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes to drive there<br/>
from the eastern side of Lexington, KY. <br/>
Placed September 2, 2000<br/>

<br/>
The letterbox hunt begins from the Bison Way Trailhead Parking. To get to<br/>
the Trailhead: <br/>
* Take I-64 approximately 16 miles east of Lexington from I-75 to exit 98 <br/>
"Mountain Parkway" <br/>
* Take Exit 33 off the Mountain Parkway to Slade/Beattyville <br/>
* Cross back under the Parkway and almost immediately, turn left onto Rte.<br/>
15/11 North <br/>
* After 1.5 miles, turn right onto Rte. 77  <br/>
* While on Rte. 77, you will reach the hand-hewn Nada tunnel. Open to<br/>
vehicular traffic (only one-way at a time), this tunnel is only 13 feet wide<br/>
and not lit!!   Be sure to pull over to the right of the road before<br/>
entering the tunnel and read the historical sign about the tunnel. <br/>
* Stay on Rte. 77 for a total of 5.2 miles till it turns left, then go<br/>
forward on Rte. 715 for another 3/4 of a mile. You will see the Bison Way<br/>
Trailhead parking lot on your left before going over a stone bridge. <br/>
<br/>
Hiking Note: This letterbox is located on the way to the scenic Indian<br/>
Staircase and a large rockhouse (cave).  If you are in the mood for a longer<br/>
hike, you might want to proceed to one or both of these sites.  They are not<br/>
officially maintained by the forest service, so they are not marked by<br/>
signs.  You might have a little difficulty finding them on your own, but if<br/>
you ask other folks along the trail they can probably direct you.<br/>
<br/>
Sightseeing Note: Before or after your letterbox adventure, be sure to drive<br/>
over the bridge just after the Trailhead parking lot and proceed 1/4 mile to<br/>
the Gladie Historical Site on your right. There is a ranger station there<br/>
with lots of info about the area as well as a historical log cabin and barn<br/>
with rustic implements. <br/>
<br/>
Difficulty Note: Our directions aren't too complicated for finding the box,<br/>
but be aware that the hike there is a true hike. It isn't so very long  -<br/>
maybe 1  miles each way - but it does have some steep elevation changes, a<br/>
creek crossing or two, and a sometimes rough path. Ladies, leave the<br/>
stilettos at home!! <br/>
<br/>
At last, the letterbox-finding info: <br/>
*  From the Trailhead parking lot, follow the sign for the Bison Way Trail<br/>
(Forest Service trail #210).   You'll stay on this trail for  of a mile.<br/>
At one point, you'll seem to be at an intersection with a narrower path<br/>
straight ahead of you and a wider path angling down to the right. Stay to<br/>
the right - that's still the Bison Way trail. <br/>
* Stay on the trail until it comes to a very clear T-intersection with<br/>
another trail. There will be a small Bison Way trail sign on your left, but<br/>
no indication of the trail that you are turning onto - it is the Sheltowee<br/>
Trace.<br/>
* Turn left onto the Sheltowee trace. <br/>
* Along this trail you may hear jungle screams and hollers. Those are from<br/>
youngsters rappelling off the rock face a ways in front of you. Do not be<br/>
alarmed. <br/>
* Cross over a creek on the washboard crossing of logs. <br/>
* Immediately turn right and walk by a "V" tree on your left that has two<br/>
trunks growing out of one base. Then walk to the second tree that is just<br/>
like it but larger, also on your left. <br/>
* From this second "V" tree, walk 10 paces ahead and then hop back over the<br/>
creek at the narrow point there. <br/>
* At a bearing of 130 degrees, you'll see a big sturdy tree. <br/>
* The letterbox is located at the base of this tree.<br/>
