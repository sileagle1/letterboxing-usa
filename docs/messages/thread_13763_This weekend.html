<br/>
     Sue &amp; I were away all weekend and glad we missed the bad vibes <br/>
circulating on through this group. Let's put this junk behind us and <br/>
get back to what we all care about - LETTERBOXING!! Randy - your <br/>
comments were right on target and MusicWoman - thanks for putting <br/>
into words what I was thinking as we caught up last night! <br/>
Letterboxers are the nicest people in the world, as far as we are <br/>
concerned.<br/>
<br/>
     With that said, we found Rubaduc's VT Tree at the Guilford VT <br/>
Welcome Center Friday night [Great stamp RTRW!] and found 2 of the <br/>
Valley Quests in Grafton, VT: Grafton Ponds and Grafton Cave. We <br/>
could not find the Rockingham Meetinghouse quest - solved the puzzle <br/>
but could not find the box. I have emailed them to see if has been <br/>
verified lately. The Valley Quest book is nicely arranged with a <br/>
chart in the back that has location, approx total time for the quest, <br/>
difficulty factor, whether the box is available all year around or <br/>
just April to November, etc.<br/>
<br/>
     It looks like we may be out of the rainy weather so get out <br/>
there and box!!<br/>
