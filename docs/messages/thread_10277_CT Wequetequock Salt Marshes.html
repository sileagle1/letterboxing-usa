Amy and I found these boxes on 7/5/2 if it's any help.  We had a very <br/>
hard time finding box #2.  It's acctually (sp) a funny story, we <br/>
ended up getting slightly turned around and had to follow Ruth, our <br/>
black lab who has an uncanny nack for finding trails, back to the <br/>
main trail (to make a long story short).  I don't know if it's seen <br/>
any visitors since then.  Sorry <br/>
Patrick and Amy<br/>
