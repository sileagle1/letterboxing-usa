plants trees birds and all sorts of critters.  If the plant is a non- <br/>
native you might have some challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Google searches often turn up pictures on the "Images" page.<br/>
<br/>
I like the Audubon regional guides as well .  They are handy and just <br/>
right for the car.<br/>
<br/>
For the Western half of Oregon and Washington I favor "Cascade <br/>
Olympic Natural History" by Daniel Mathews.  It doesn't get much <br/>
better than this handy book. <br/>
<br/>
 For plant intensive book  Plants of the Pacific Northwest Coast ( <br/>
includes BC and lower Alaska)  By Pojar.  All of Pojars books are <br/>
impressive.  There is one for the dry side that is on my wish list.<br/>
