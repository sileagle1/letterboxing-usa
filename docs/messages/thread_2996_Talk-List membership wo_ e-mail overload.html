&gt; Bob, am I understanding you to say that there's a way<br/>

<br/>
Yes! I never recieve any email from this list either, but visit it <br/>
daily on the web. <br/>
<br/>
-Go to http://www.egroups.com and<br/>
-"Sign in," an adventure in itself the first time you visit. Then<br/>
-Click "my groups" and<br/>
-"letterboxing"<br/>
-click on "Edit My Membership" and<br/>
-choose the "no email/read on the web only" option. Then<br/>
-click on "messages" and, voila!<br/>
<br/>
You'll see a nice list of all the posts and you can just click on the <br/>
ones you want to read. An added plus: no email means no viruses...<br/>
<br/>
I do think there might be a disadvantage to this option: I can never <br/>
see people's whole email address and can not post to them <br/>
individually off-list. But it's still a nice way to go.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
