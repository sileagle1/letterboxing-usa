<br/>
I'm fairly new to this letterboxing thing, but have fallen in love <br/>
with it already.  Rather unfortunately, I have so far been limited to <br/>
South Jersey.  Letterboxes aren't as sparse here as out in the <br/>
midwest, but they aren't as thick as in Connecticut, either.  Also, a <br/>
lot of them are mystery boxes...and not easy ones.  <br/>
<br/>
I did find an excellent resource for finding some of the more obscure <br/>
places in South Jersey, and thought I'd pass it along.  I also added <br/>
it to the links page: It's a group called "Ghost Towns of Southern <br/>
NJ - South Jersey and Pine Barrens history, ghost towns" and the url <br/>
is http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ghosttownsofsouthernnj/<br/>
<br/>
I was also curious about any other NJ letterboxers out there.  I'm <br/>
not comfortable tramping through woods alone, and my boyfriend will <br/>
doubtless eventually get tired of chasing tupperware boxes.   He's <br/>
not a LBer.  Anybody from NJ, especially the Cherry Hill area?  <br/>

What a great group! Funny part was halfway through the joining <br/>
process, DH comes in to hang over shoulder and says, in effect, oh <br/>
yeah sure, been there done that, already in group. So he is, and has <br/>
posted family pictures in the photo section, no less. Taken in the <br/>
PB, of course.<br/>
He says you may need a new boyfriend if the current one is not <br/>
willing to hike along.<br/>
(This from the loyal fellow who threw down a quick log bridge to get <br/>
to the Devil's Bathtub box and toss it to me, after we found it <br/>
stranded on a hummock of ... well, you know, one of those hummock <br/>
things at the base of a tree when the water rises, and rises, and <br/>
rises...... and the paths become streams, etc.)<br/>
