&gt; Wed May 7th and lasts the rest of the month.<br/>
<br/>
Could be retitled "Why CT rocks as a place to letterbox." Funny that <br/>
one of the first and most densley settled states would be turkey and <br/>
letterboxing heaven. A hundred years ago the whole thing was clear <br/>
cut farmland, with 50 mile views from the onion patches of Walingford <br/>
to Long Island Sound. The closest turkey was somewhere in Canada.<br/>
<br/>
It was too danged rocky to plow, so all the farmers moved to Ohio and <br/>
forest took over the fields. Affluent yankees got involved with <br/>
America's nascent conservation movement and land was set aside like <br/>
crazy. But there were no turkey in 'dem woods, so the DEP imported a <br/>
flock of 14 from New York. They liked the woods and bore many <br/>
children: nowadays around our neighborhood they're a traffic hazard, <br/>
especially this time of year with the toms all puffed up and blustery <br/>
trying to impress the gals.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxers came and soon became traffic hazards themselves. Just <br/>
try and buy a blue tupperware here: you have to reserve in advance.<br/>

Just some interesting CT Wildlife facts:<br/>
   -   CT currently has the most forest land in history since the <br/>
start of the industrial revolution<br/>
   -   CT's populations of turkey and deer are at the highest levels <br/>
in history ( with deer populations in Fairfield county being the <br/>
highest in the state!) <br/>
<br/>
Yes, i AM a bio-geek! (4 years of wildlife biology will do that to <br/>
ya!) <br/>

PS - The Wal-Mart in Groton had a bin of rubbermaid containers that <br/>
are perfect LB size for $0.88 each when I was in there Wednesday <br/>
night.   They weren't the nice rubbery-blue-topped ones, they were <br/>
the ones with the off-white plastic tops, but the squirrels don't <br/>
seem to have a preference in the last taste-test I saw!<br/>
