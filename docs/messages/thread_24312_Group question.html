<br/>
I know the placer you are talking about - Gryzzled Gryphon, right?  Some of<br/>
his clues are not in emailable format (and he doesn't do things<br/>
like scanners), so they have to be either hand-delivered or mailed.  By<br/>
putting a twist on distributing the clues, he is continuing his take on the<br/>
game.  Frankly, I'm amazed he's even put them online - they were WOM for the<br/>
longest!<br/>
<br/>
But with respect to your general question, not the specific one, it makes me<br/>
uneasy when I have to hand out my address too, especially in a situation<br/>
like that.  I usually use my husband's office, or have something mailed to a<br/>
friend's PO box.<br/>
<br/>
BUT - in the specific case, I'm betting you can work out some sort of<br/>
arrangement with him without giving him your address (just tell him you are<br/>
uneasy with that - he'll understand!) - you may just have to get creative!<br/>
It's never EASY dealing with him - but it is always INTERESTING!<br/>
