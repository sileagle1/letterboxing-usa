                    <div class="plaintext-content">Personally I say put whatever out there...  I love solving a good mystery<br/>
as much as I love to go out on a "simple" letterbox.  Each has their own<br/>
distinct quality.  Every letterbox is placed in a beautiful location for a<br/>
hike or view.  And I have been more amazed as to the ingenuity and artwork<br/>
that has been apearing since I first began.<br/>
<br/>
I can personally attest to spending a year (of my spare time of course)<br/>
trying to figure out some of Randy's awesome clues.  In fact I have been<br/>
learning some history along the way that I would have never looked up<br/>
prior to trying to decifer some the great mystery clues. Damn inferior<br/>
high school educational history course that I took!!!<br/>
<br/>
And clearly now that the hobby is starting to take off, you can find just<br/>
about find any kind of letterbox within a short drive here in New England.<br/>
And I am sure it will be the same across the country within a short amount<br/>
of time.<br/>
<br/>
I like writing good challenging clues as much as I like solving them.<br/>
However, I equally enjoy detailed walk throughs (otherwise I will never<br/>
find more than a handful. And besides I need some stamps to include in my<br/>
logbook other than my own artwork.)<br/>
<br/>
So in closing, IMHO place whatever kind of box you like out there.  I am<br/>
sure that most people will be glad when they find it.  Variety is the<br/>
spice of life. My only request is to indicate with your clues how<br/>
difficult you think it is (Terrain and Clue Decifering).  This way you<br/>
can plan your time and include youngones accordingly.  And if you drive<br/>
100 miles to find a difficult one and come up empty handed, that was what<br/>
you were expected for such a good challenge.<br/>
<br/>
If GB can place tens of thousands of boxes at Dartmoor, clearly there<br/>
is more than enough space in the entire North America for a few more<br/>
mystery, hitchhiker boxes, or whatever letterboxes.<br/>
