We have had reports back on Buffalo Jump and some of our others in <br/>
Montana and all are listed in place. Buffalo Jump keeps getting <br/>
found by non letterboxers that are Native Americans and I have had <br/>
some real interesting notes. All have been very supportive of our <br/>
hobby and this particular letterbox. We left a bunch in Cody, Wy. <br/>
and it seems as though a teacher in a third grade class has used <br/>
letterboxing in her class, so there is a bunch more there. Mtwalker <br/>
a new letterboxer in Mt. may be able to give you more precise info. <br/>
If you happen to hit any of ours please advise status.<br/>

Deadwood/Black Hills), but Karen and I just got back from that area <br/>
at the beginning of June.  The "President's Pick" and "Spearfish <br/>
Canyon" letterboxes were alive and well at that time (those were the <br/>
only wo we had time to look for).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
