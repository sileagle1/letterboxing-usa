&gt; Please take the time to go to the site and search for boxes by <br/>
placer.<br/>
&gt; In there is the choice of AbandonedBoxes. There are plenty! If you<br/>
&gt; want to adopt boxes in your area, you will be able to see which <br/>
boxes<br/>
&gt; are abandoned by this list. In some cases, the clues to the <br/>
abandoned<br/>
&gt; boxes have the original poster's e-mail address in them. You can<br/>
&gt; contact that person and see if they want to maintain their box, if<br/>
&gt; they want to box to disappear, of if they want to let you take <br/>
over.<br/>
&gt; That's what I'm doing for Georgia (we have 3 in this state). <br/>
&gt; If you can't find the e-mail of the person in the clues, you can <br/>
copy<br/>
&gt; and paste the clues to your computer so that you'll have them. At <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; point, I would say it is safe to take over maintaining the box if<br/>
&gt; that's what you want to do. <br/>
&gt; Be sure and search for all of the abandoned boxes. I can see why <br/>
Wes<br/>
&gt; and others want to clean up the database!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my 2 cents,<br/>
