I am looking forward to many many codes and boxes to show up soon.<br/>

I've been planning to carve the brands from the Da Vinci code.<br/>
<br/>
I'm in the midst of solving URU too (two ages down ? to go?).<br/>
<br/>
I'll wait 'till I'm done and go back to find the best things to carve.<br/>

One of the stamps I found in Pandora's CHAOS series is a Myst symbol, but I confess I <br/>
don't even know what that means!<br/>

Synchronicity!!  A friend of mine handed me that book not ten minutes <br/>
ago and said, "If you like clues , this book is for you". I love it <br/>
when events line up like that.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have seen your stamp where the corners meet.<br/>

(all you books lovers know what I mean) I got The DaVinci Code a <br/>
week ago, and finished it TODAY. How coincidental is that? It's got <br/>
to be one of my favorite books to date... not to mention so much of <br/>
the historical artifacture (is that a word?) is true! I'll be <br/>
carving up some related stamps and getting out with them when the <br/>
weather warms up.  I'm thinking something about Divine Proportion... <br/>
or something about iconography or particular symbols and their rise <br/>
or demise through history. Any ideas?<br/>
