                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's odd, Michaels is the only craft store I have been able to <br/>
find it in.  Are you sure you are looking in the right place?  Sales <br/>
clerks don't tend to know what it is when you ask for the pink stuff <br/>
or stamp carving materials.  It is usually located in the section <br/>
with pencils, erasers, and linoleum carving tools.  In short, look <br/>
in the art supply section because I have never found it with the <br/>
stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
If you don't like to do the online thing, they might be willing to <br/>
special order for you, or you can try an art supply store.  Just <br/>
make sure to ask for speedy stamp (the actual name of the pink <br/>
stuff).  Avoid Speedy Cut (the white stuff) like the plague.  It <br/>
crumbles something fierce.  The same company makes a nice <br/>
carving tool set that was cumbersome initially for me, but after <br/>
using it for just a short while, I rarely pick up my exacto knife <br/>
anymore.  Michaels usually carries that too.<br/>
<br/>
If you are willing to venture online.  I am finding that I love working <br/>
with PZ Cut from www.stampeaz.com so much more than the <br/>
pink stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you in your beginning ventures!<br/>
