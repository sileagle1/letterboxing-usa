My dad is visiting this weekend &amp; my hubby just finished our first <br/>

for the first time.  Any suggestions for good boxes to start with in <br/>
Northern Virginia?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Northern Virginia has a lot of boxes!  I haven't gotten to the eastern <br/>
part of the county so I don't know anything about those boxes.   <br/>
<br/>
If you are in the western part of Fairfax county, try the ones in <br/>
Ellanor Lawrence Park, off of Rt 28 on Walney Road.  There are four <br/>
there - Ellanor C. Lawrence Park (2) and Two Birders Letterbox are <br/>
both in the same park although one says it's in Chantilly and the <br/>
other says Centreville.  Bump on a Log is listed as being in Walney <br/>
park, but I think they mean Ellanor C. Lawrence Park, which is on <br/>
Walney Road.  This is a good place to start because you can get four <br/>
at one time.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a new series in Vienna/Oakton.  It's called In the Park. <br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>

All of the letterboxes in Richmond are easy to find. Here is a list <br/>
with time estimates:<br/>
<br/>
Bryan Park - 1/2 hour - easy stroll, need a compass<br/>
Reedy Creek - 15 minutes - by the river, may need compass<br/>
Forest Hill Park - 1  hour - park is beautiful, clues are very good<br/>
UR - 1/2 - beautiful campus, clues are good<br/>
<br/>
There are many more new boxes I have yet to visit. Hopefully this <br/>
weekend I will be able to hit the trail.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For a first time and guaranteed success, I recommend "Get Into the Game" at<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/va/getintog.htm which was placed with the "First<br/>
Timer" in mind.  There have been lots of people who have stamped in to it.<br/>
Half the fun of this is reading all the stamps of the other who have gone<br/>
before.  "Turning Over a New Leaf" at<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/md/dumpling.htm#leaf is in the same park and<br/>
only a short walk from where you parked to retrieve "Get Into the Game".  If<br/>
you look at both instructions together, it should be pretty easy to figure<br/>
out how to go from one to the other.  We did the "In the Park" series<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/va/dominion.htm last Sunday.  They were all<br/>
brand new and probably still only have our stamps in them.  The Oak Marr<br/>
park one was a bit difficult to find, and you had to drive to a different<br/>
location for each box.  We did the "Gulf Branch letterboxes"<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/va/gulfbran.htm several weeks ago and really<br/>
enjoyed the park and hike.  I would recommend them highly.  If you are in<br/>
the mood to try a mystery box and don't mind a bit of a drive, I recommend<br/>
"Scrabble/Be Prepared" at http://www.letterboxing.org/va/scrabble.htm and<br/>
http://www.1bigred.com/users/jayc/letterbox/misc.htm#Be.  They are in the<br/>
same location which we really enjoyed.  I will warn you that Scrabble itself<br/>
is difficult to find, however, failure there will not preclude you from<br/>
finding the other boxes in the series.  The other mystery box I would highly<br/>
recommend is "Paris" at http://www.letterboxing.org/md/dumpling.htm#paris.<br/>
Once again it was a beautiful location and we really enjoyed being there.<br/>
Take heed though, the hike to the box is straight up, just as describe in<br/>
the instructions.<br/>
