I think I read a goodly exerpt in Outside magazine some months ago... <br/>
very, very funny...  I'm looking forward to reading the entire book.<br/>
<br/>
...speaking of books, the first half of "The Road Home" (another<br/>
traveling title, although the book itself isn't) by Jim Harrison is<br/>
good.  I read it twice and would have used a highliter on my favorite<br/>
passages if it hadn't been a library book.  The second half was fair...<br/>

I've been ignoring Bill Bryson's new book, "A Walk in the Woods"<br/>
because of the goofy looking bear on the cover, figuring it was another<br/>
redneck take off, but finally thumbed through one evening while waiting<br/>
for my kids at the mall (I find all books irresitible). Has anyone else<br/>
read this great new book? It's a very different kind of Appalacian<br/>
Trail opus, "choke on your coffee funny" and very well written. With<br/>
secret dreams of someday doing the AT myself (or the Pacific Crest<br/>
Trail, or the Continental Divide, or, hell, walking all the way around<br/>
the world), I've read just about all the stuffy classics. Bryson is<br/>
wonderfully different. No techie which-ultralight-gear stuff but<br/>
chock-full of self deprecating revelation about the true challenge of<br/>
the hike, and with a modest, well put, running essay on land<br/>
conservation. I highly recommend this one for yourself or for someone's<br/>
holiday stocking stuffer.<br/>

I read the book last spring and absolutely loved it...  I've been<br/>
passing it on to all my hiking friendsand acquaintances.  Very funny<br/>
indeed.<br/>
<br/>
Well deserving of being the 1st title in our "virtual library"!<br/>

Thom, Jim Harrison is one of my neglected favorites! My brother James<br/>
and I had been passing him back and forth between us for years, with<br/>
Jamie generally swiping my copies and me replacing them as I found them<br/>
on the discount racks. I still play "Legends of the Fall" in my head<br/>
whenever I think of my honeymoon (which, come to think of it would make<br/>
a good addition to the book/video library). ("Legends," that is, not<br/>
the honeymoon tape...). But....I digress.....I hadn't heard of "Road<br/>
Home" and am now most eagerly awaiting Monday and the library. Thanks!<br/>
