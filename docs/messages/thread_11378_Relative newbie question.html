                    <html><body>well.... this is an interesting question.  Since I'm guessing that they are in separate boxes that you have to physically find, I would count them individually.  For example, I counted the Ants go Marching Series in Hampton, CT as 10.... even though when it was first posted, it was considered only one box.  Of course, after finding all 10 (which took days, since the clues were incorrect at the time) I counted them as 10 because it was such a production to find them!!!!!

<br/>Hope this helps!

if I have to follow separate clues to a box, I count each as a find. It<br/>
would be like doing a series of boxes that are all in different locations<br/>
(you just happen to get one image from them). However, if a box contains<br/>
multiple stamps, I count it as one. Except in the case of a hitch hiker. :-)<br/>
