I realize that it's been some time now but this is just a quick post to let everyone know that the Walk Through Geologic Time series at Dinosaur State Park in Rocky Hill, CT has been revised, repaired and expanded.  The Trilobite box is unchanged - wet log book was replaced.  A new addition - Archaeopteryx - has been added; please re-hide carefully.  Eubrontes II replaces the original with a new location and slightly new stamp.  Thanks to all who have visited.<br/>
