                    <div class="plaintext-content">We also had a great time at Wendell on Saturday . Thanks Deanne and <br/>
Ginger ! You really know how to throw a party . <br/>
It was nice to meet Bonnie and Betsy , and also hunt down and find <br/>
the great boxes in the park that Bonnie planted so long ago . And <br/>
just discussing with Bonnie about the beginnings of letterboxing was <br/>
not only enjoyable because of my own interest in this topic , but <br/>
because Bonnie is just so incredibly nice .<br/>
Hiking and finding boxes with Chris and Kim was great . Boy , does <br/>
that Rustypuff know her nature stuff , I don't think there was one <br/>
thing that she couldn't identify on the trail .<br/>
I'd never attended a gathering where there was singing and candles <br/>
getting blown out , but it sure was fun . I love my new LbNA hat that <br/>
I received and Lori is very excited about planting the great stamp <br/>
she won in the grab . Thanks RTRW ( you are amazing ! ) for <br/>
contributing this . <br/>
As  always it was great to see all the familiar faces and get to meet <br/>
some new folks too . We went out looking for and finding a couple <br/>
boxes in the area with Solar and Binx after the gathering and had a <br/>
great time . And finally hit F500 !<br/>
<br/>
Again Thanks to All for making " the game " so much fun to play !<br/>
