                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, <br/>
we didn't place the riverfront boxes but circumstances<br/>
dictated that we made a temporary adjustment.  As soon<br/>
as we sat down and got box #3 "Easter Egg" 2 teenagers<br/>
showed up and started fishing right in front of the<br/>
stump.  We waited around for a while to see if they<br/>
would leave but there was no way we could replace it. <br/>
We brought it with us the 4th box "Marshmallow Peeps"<br/>
and stacked it on top of the 4th box.  So, 3rd box may<br/>
seem MIA but is actually near the 4th.  We're sorry we<br/>
couldn't replace it but we were afraid that it would<br/>
turn up missing if we did.<br/>
<br/>
but on a side note.  THe easter stamps are Really cool<br/>
and we recommend them highly <br/>
<br/>
sorry about the alteration.  <br/>
<br/>
jen and jim<br/>
