                    <div class="plaintext-content">It should be a simple matter to replace the log for more stamps.  I <br/>
offer to do it if needed.  I do recommend expanding it with a another <br/>
film cannister so you would have two taped end to end.  Then the <br/>
stamp would fit in one side and a larger log in the other.  The <br/>
double cannister tube would still fit in the same hiding place.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yes, there was a message recently from, I think, legerdemaine <br/>
(who <br/>
&gt; placed it) <br/>
&gt; &gt; that the log had filled up and she had removed it temporarily but <br/>
&gt; planned to <br/>
&gt; &gt; put it back with a new log. So I guess don't bother to look for <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; until we hear it's <br/>
&gt; &gt; back.<br/>
