Search for the Golden Acorn: Ranger Toms Excellent Adventure (3)<br/>
A Trio of boxes in Greenbrier State Park<br/>
Near Hagerstown, MD in Washington County<br/>
8 October 2002<br/>
Placed by the Apple Dumpling Gang (adglbna@aol.com)<br/>
<br/>
Take Route 40 towards Hagerstown and the park will be on your left.  <br/>
You will need to pay a small admission to get in.  ( it varies from <br/>
$2.00 per vehicle off season to $3.00 per person during the summer)  <br/>
Take a left at the T intersection at the bottom of the hill and park <br/>
near the Visitors Center.  If it is open, pop in and pick up a trail <br/>
map.  There are over 10 miles of trails in this park but <br/>
unfortunately there are no pets allowed.  The trails are well marked <br/>
but the footing is uneven and rocky so wear good shoes.<br/>
<br/>
The Thorn in his Side- Box 1<br/>
<br/>
Ranger Tom Cooch knew he would be in real trouble if the other <br/>
rangers ever found out what he was doing.  He was supposed to be out <br/>
on the trail pulling the pesky boxes out of their leafy niches but <br/>
instead, here he was, book in hand, desperately trying to find the <br/>
Golden Acorn so he could be the first to stamp in.  He half wished <br/>
that he had never met Kel, Marsha, and the Lighthouse Lady on the <br/>
trail and been lured into this twisted double life.  <br/>
<br/>
Tom started his journey on the green blazed trail behind the <br/>
Visitors Center.  He knew these trails pretty well so he decided to <br/>
start at the end of the loop since it might be shorter.  He walked up <br/>
the trail between the two piles of wood and started up the hill, <br/>
reminiscing about the beautiful Dazyes that used to blanket these <br/>
woods.  He and his girlfriend Mary (from VA) used to come out here <br/>
when it was dark and watch the Fireflys dance among the flowers.  He <br/>
carefully walked around the fallen trees and continued up the hill <br/>
passing the Deer Tracks sign. (#11)  After Tom passed sign number 8 <br/>
(black bear) he noticed a small patch of white to his left.  Here, <br/>
where two trees on one trunk oozed over the white rocks, someone had <br/>
stashed a box!  Tom was one excited Newbe!  <br/>
<br/>
The Haunted House (aka The Leapfrog Incident)- Box 2<br/>
<br/>
Tom continued up the trail (still going the wrong way, which is <br/>
actually the right way, can you tell Tom was raised by a <br/>
Psychomommy?)  past sign #7  and parked it on a bench.  Some hippies <br/>
had obviously hiked this way and had taken a moment to <br/>
carve Healwar and Scott hugs trees into the bench.  One of the <br/>
other rangers had reported some paranormal activity on the yellow <br/>
blazed trail up ahead so he decided to check it out.  Supposedly, <br/>
Biki, a young Irish immigrant, had died out here while playing a <br/>
rousing game of Leapfrog.  Ashamed by his tragic (and quite <br/>
ludicrous) death, Bikis ghost had been seen jumping about the trails <br/>
desperately trying to regain his Celtic Pride.  <br/>
<br/>
Tom slowly made his way up the boulder strewn gully following the <br/>
yellow blazes.  Where the yellow blazed trail takes a hard left, Tom <br/>
noticed a new sign which reads,  Trail Closed for Habitat <br/>
Regeneration. On the sign was a cute little Ladybug napping between <br/>
the H and the A.. As he gazed to the left, Tom was astounded to see <br/>
thousands more ladybugs at the base of the large hipped, gnarled <br/>
tree.  Could these be related to Biki and the haunting?  He just had <br/>
to know!  Upon investigating this bizarre infestation, Tom found yet <br/>
another box under some leaves, sticks, and about 2384 ladybugs. (yes, <br/>
he stopped to count.)<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Acorn (aka Tribute to Squirrel)- Box 3<br/>
<br/>
Tom couldnt believe his luck!  2 boxes found and he hadnt even <br/>
snared the one he came forthe elusive Golden Acorn.  He headed back <br/>
down the yellow blazed trail until he reached the hippy bench.  <br/>
Seated on the bench were a Turtle and a Mountain Scorpia playing <br/>
canasta.  Carefully avoiding the bench, Tom headed down the green <br/>
blazed trail to the left.  The tribute box was supposed to be down <br/>
here somewhere near some piles of rocks that ran along the left side <br/>
of the trail. (if you reach sign #4, youve gone too far) He found <br/>
the area described and pinpointed the location of the white rock in <br/>
the middle of the grouping.  From that rock, Tom took a bearing of <br/>
25 and spotted the large fallen and decaying tree.  At the end of <br/>
the tree, just behind the stump, Tom finally found the Golden Acorn <br/>
under some bark.  With triumphant glee, he yawped his battle cry into <br/>
the woods..Boxitup!<br/>
<br/>
(note to Tom: The Maryland Chapter of Boxaholics Anonymous meets at <br/>
the 3rd tree stump on the left on alternate Tuesdays and Thursdays at <br/>
moonset. Rangers are welcome.)<br/>
