and was more than thrilled to find TWO postcards<br/>
that came from the Turville Point letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
  The first from Steven (of Door County) ~ that was the<br/>
one I was expecting as I knew that he was in town last<br/>
weekend for the teacher's conference and really hoped<br/>
that he had time to search for the box. Steven reports<br/>
that he found the letterbox after a bit of a search (because<br/>
there are several fire-charred tree possibilities in the area!).<br/>
I love your stamp and am honored to add the postcard as<br/>
the first of its kind in my journal! Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
  The second was from someone who evidently found the<br/>
box by accident, and was kind enough to write to me ~<br/>
This is what he or she wrote:<br/>
<br/>
"Interesting that the first 'letterbox' I come across<br/>
should be a memorial to David Crosby .... I knew him<br/>
well for 20+ years. I am a classical musician in the<br/>
Madison Symphony ~ as of 11/06/98 your letterbox<br/>
is well although devoid of a writing implement.<br/>
   What a neat thing to find on a cold fall walk!"<br/>
<br/>
This was exciting, too, (and SO cosmic!) but I felt<br/>
badly that I didn't have a pen in the box for someone <br/>
like this who came across the box accidently... <br/>
The person didn't leave a name, but maybe I'll send<br/>
a stamped image c/o the Symphony.<br/>
(Making another note to myself to take a pen with me <br/>
when I go back again....)<br/>
