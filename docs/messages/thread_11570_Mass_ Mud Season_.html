                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our crew went out to find the Angel Bear Letterbox (Wilson Mountain, <br/>
Dedham) and the Tree for All Season box (Chase Woodlands, Dover).<br/>
<br/>
We found both but the mud and water on the trails at Chase Woodlands <br/>
were daunting! We had a little trouble following the number signs on <br/>
the way to the box -- I think our eyes were focused on the ground to <br/>
watch for mud puddles. What are probably seasonal little streams are <br/>
flowing over the trail in several places. The pretty stamp was worth <br/>
the hike but I recommend wearing your old hikers if you go any time <br/>
soon!<br/>
<br/>
There is also some mud at Wilson Mountain park, but most of the time <br/>
it could be avoided by sticking to the side of the trail.<br/>
<br/>
You know it was a long winter when we're willing to slog through the <br/>
mud to enjoy the warming weather!<br/>
