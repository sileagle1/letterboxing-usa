I just checked the list- even though the page is called travelers, it <br/>
seems that the majority of the listings are hitchhikers not personal <br/>
travelers.  Maybe they should have 2 lists rather than one- one for HH <br/>
and another for PTS.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; FYI... I moved my personal traveler to the travelers page on LBNA.  <br/>
If you put your status in before, would you please do it again?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
I have been Dartmoor Letterboxing quite a bit and so here is the<br/>
explanation....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Traveller Stamps and Travelling Stamps ARE different !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Though they are likely to use the words interchangeably !!!<br/>
<br/>
The best is the Traveller though !!!<br/>
<br/>
I love em !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TRAVELLER !<br/>
<br/>
A Traveller stamp is a SPECIAL KIND OF "Personal" stamp...<br/>
<br/>
In England...You ONLY use your personal stamp in visitors books...in<br/>
the boxes themselves...<br/>
<br/>
YOU NEVER STAMP IT ELSEWHERE  eg you never stamp it in someone elses<br/>
collecting book at a meet ...<br/>
<br/>
So no X counts in England !!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What they will do ..and only SOME BOXERS....is that SOME boxers carry<br/>
a special stamp..often a very very ornate stamp called a TRAVELLER !<br/>
<br/>
You have to ASK FOR IT !!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Are you carrying a traveller ?"<br/>
<br/>
And they can eccentric <!-- --> ..ie you only get it if you are with your<br/>
dog..or wearing a hat etc !! (told you)!<br/>
<br/>
Often they carry these ready to EXCHANGE....you aren't likely to get<br/>
it if you don't exchange another TRAVELLER for it !<br/>
<br/>
But it varies...<br/>
<br/>
Just a thing about collecting...The Brits tend to use POSTCARDS<br/>
..blank cards about 3 x 5 to stamp their finds on...and carry a<br/>
special box with them to do this...(listen to the radio play..they<br/>
talk of cards there !)<br/>
<br/>
So a traveller is often a ready made up and often a hand colored<br/>
postcard with the stamp already impressed on it !!<br/>
<br/>
Very collectable...and quite rare and like in the radio play they are<br/>
often heirloom stamps ! Father to son sort of thing !!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A TRAVELLING STAMP....<br/>
<br/>
Yep that is a hitchiker !<br/>
It is very very very rare in Dartmoor...<br/>
<br/>
The most famous is Prisoner...<br/>
<br/>
Dartmoor itself is home to the most remote prison in England...and so<br/>
naturally the stamp is a prisoner on the run on the moor...<br/>
<br/>
The brits have a funny sense of humor !<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps...<br/>
