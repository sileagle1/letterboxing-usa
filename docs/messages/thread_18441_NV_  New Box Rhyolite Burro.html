Clues<br/>
The ghost town of Rhyolite is located approximately 4 miles west of Beatty off of State <br/>
Highway 374, the road that leads to Death Valley, California. Rhyolite is about 5 miles east <br/>
of the California border. Beatty Nevada is 115 miles north of Las Vegas on Highway 95. I <br/>
can't speak for the ghosts, but I do know that burros occassionally make an appearance <br/>
along the former main streets of this incredible desert ruin.<br/>
<br/>
At the top of the hill stands the former Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad Depot, and <br/>
excellent example of the mission-style depot of its time. From the depot's parking area, <br/>
you can either park your car and walk, or continue to drive, east on a gravel road leading <br/>
down into the desert.<br/>
<br/>
You will reach a junction of four roads, including the one you are on. If you look south, <br/>
this junction is nearly in alignment with a former hill affectionally known locally as the <br/>
"Semi-Step Pyramid of Zoser."<br/>
<br/>
Choose the north road, and follow it until it ends in a matter of yards.<br/>
<br/>
Facing north at the end of the road, scan the landscape for a wooden post pointing SW at a <br/>
60 degree angle. Walk directly towards this post 70 paces. Look left to a rock cairn with a <br/>
very large flat top.<br/>
<br/>
If you are at the correct spot, looking south from this cairn, the Step Pyramid will be on <br/>
the left and the Bullfrog Hill will be on the right of a U-shaped vista. Chloride Cliff in the <br/>
Amargosa Range in Death Valley National Park will be in the dead center of this vista.<br/>
<br/>
Remove the rocks carefully to reach your objective and be mindful of critters. Please rehide <br/>
well.<br/>

<br/>
NOTE: Always take adequate precautions (such as prodding with a stick and/or wearing <br/>
gloves) before reaching iunder rocks in the wild. Rattlesnakes do inhabit the area, and <br/>
particularly during the summer the temperature can reach well over 100 degrees. Be <br/>
prepared!<br/>
