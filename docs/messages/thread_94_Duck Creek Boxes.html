four of the Duck Creek boxes. Julie went with us but wouldn't <br/>
give any clues away.  First, of course, we had to have a North<br/>
Texas Letterboxing Summit(we missed Shannon! that will teach us to be <br/>
so spur of the moment!). Then it was off to the boxes.  We<br/>
found all four and had a great time. It was an absolutely <br/>
beautiful day - perfect for letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
We did talk about Deborahs' box and were sorry to hear of the<br/>
loss. We took extra care to make sure that people<br/>
had passed us before actually pulling a box out of hidding in<br/>
front of them - just in case(sad, isn't it?). Extra care was<br/>
also taken to replace so not easily seen.<br/>
<br/>
I am off to work on my stamps for a second and third box......<br/>
