to find that one of the clues is no longer there.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the evil troll has wreaked his revenge on the garden <br/>
gnome and tore down his new home (the metal bridge).  It appears <br/>
though that the gnome managed to make it to the other letterbox in <br/>
the park and hides there for the time being.  The log for the Redwing <br/>
stamp is filling up quite nicely in the meantime.<br/>
<br/>
The "Little Diva" letterbox is great!!  It's in a very scenic spot <br/>
(we sat and enjoyed the scenerey while we were there), and a good job <br/>
on the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for re-planting these fun boxes :)<br/>
