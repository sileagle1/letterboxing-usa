Boxes #22-24: Where? Oh Where?<br/>
Location: Somewhere in New Jersey<br/>
Placed: 03/10/2002<br/>
Difficulty: 3/5 stars; 1 1/2 hours of easy hiking.<br/>
Clue page: http://www.pcdx.com/pclg/clue22.htm<br/>
<br/>
We always headed out on our hikes in the early mornings and my Dad told me =<br/>
<br/>
stories about the place we were going to visit. My favorite story happens t=<br/>
o be <br/>
about the place we're going to today. He told me how very long ago this <br/>
beautiful high place was first bought from the Lenni-Lenape and then grante=<br/>
d <br/>
to settlers and how the Indian Princess Wetumka prevented its settlers from=<br/>
<br/>
being massacred because she was in love with one of them.<br/>
<br/>
Once we were out of that terrible traffic, we headed to the northern end of=<br/>
 the <br/>
big water following the way that Tracy led and stopped our car there to beg=<br/>
in <br/>
our journey.<br/>
<br/>
Today, our journey begins as soon as I jump out of the car. I can't wait to=<br/>
 get <br/>
going, but I'll try to be patient while you read up on some Dredging and th=<br/>
en <br/>
some Watershed facts. Now I'm anxious. Please take the trail at 336 degrees=<br/>
<br/>
and let's get started.<br/>
<br/>
You're looking confused, so I'll give you this one. After that, you're on y=<br/>
our <br/>
own. I'll tell the story-you follow along. Cross over that bridge and we'll=<br/>
<br/>
continue.<br/>
<br/>
It was quite wet the last time we were here and there were horseshoe prints=<br/>
<br/>
in the mud. Horses are big and big animals scare me. Lucky for me, we came =<br/>
to <br/>
a path that took us in reverse and away from the horses. Before we turned, =<br/>
Dad <br/>
stopped. He always stops at the red. Then, he made a call on his cell phone=<br/>
. Red <br/>
is my favorite color, by the way.<br/>
<br/>
We walked down this path. I lost count of how many paces I took, but Dad sa=<br/>
id <br/>
it was 75 as we came to the second step. It was here, when I looked away at=<br/>
<br/>
196 degrees, I saw a most horrifying sightthe Loch Ness Monster. Dad stood=<br/>
<br/>
there laughing at me and told me it was just a tree trunk in the water.<br/>
<br/>
I kept looking at that monster and saw that Dad was right. The trees here s=<br/>
ure <br/>
took on confusing shapes. "Then," I thought, "if that's not the Loch Ness <br/>
Monster, that other one over there to the West is not a Big Daddy holding h=<br/>
is <br/>
little baby either." Dad held me and called me his little sprout. Still lau=<br/>
ghing, <br/>
he reminded me that even the biggest, roughest, and towering man's heart <br/>
could be found whenever he held a baby in his arms, even if his heart was <br/>
hidden under a pile of rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Once Dad's heart was found and I was calm and most of all, the horses had <br/>
passed; we went back up to where we turned away from the horses and <br/>
continued on our way. I guess by now I should introduce myself. My name <br/>
is...W....<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I got sidetracked. We came to a Y and had to decide which way to go.=<br/>
<br/>
Being as willful as I am, I wanted to run up the hill, but Dad would not le=<br/>
t me. <br/>
It was a tug-of-war, but he won this time and we headed over the big water.=<br/>
<br/>
Now, where was I? Oh yes, my name...<br/>
<br/>
Another intersection. Oh boy. Decisions, decisions. The drainage ditch look=<br/>
ed <br/>
like a fun place, but Dad wouldn't let me go in it. Instead, we went over i=<br/>
t and <br/>
our decision was made.<br/>
<br/>
We continued on our way and the Blazen Foxes assured us we were on the righ=<br/>
t <br/>
track. We headed south 25 paces before what was left of a split rail fence.=<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We followed this winding path for a while. I jumped over logs and Dad went =<br/>
<br/>
around them. We separated a few times, but we joined up again and continued=<br/>
<br/>
side by side. When it seemed we could not go any further, Dad found a way t=<br/>
o <br/>
cross the creek. A good wide tree trunk was our bridge.<br/>
<br/>
They say a rolling stone gathers no moss and from the looks of this group t=<br/>
hey <br/>
had not rolled in a very long time. Three towering sentinels stood vigil ov=<br/>
er <br/>
them as they slumbered. A rest seemed in order for us too. So, I settled my=<br/>
self <br/>
in a little nook and decided to tell you my name.<br/>
<br/>
We continued South toward a fence that I think penned in those big, mean <br/>
horses. Dad said he would carry me, but I wanted to walk. Together we went =<br/>
up <br/>
to the fence and onto a path that led to an open field and then onto a dark=<br/>
 gray <br/>
gravel road. That was much better; at least it was not wet and muddy. I hat=<br/>
e <br/>
getting my feet wet and should have let him carry me.<br/>
<br/>
We could have gone in either direction and we looked to each other for <br/>
guidance. Dad flipped a coin and I called heads. Secretly, I was hoping we =<br/>
<br/>
would go in any direction that would get us away from that fence and the <br/>
horses. Luckily, I won. And we headed North West.<br/>
<br/>
We continued, unsure of where we were, but came upon a familiar sight. "Loo=<br/>
k" <br/>
He said. "That's where we parked." That meant nothing to me since I was on =<br/>
a <br/>
mission and had one last place to go. One road led to the car and two roads=<br/>
<br/>
would have taken us back to where the horses were. So, I did the only thing=<br/>
 I <br/>
could to complete my missionI headed south again and Dad tagged along.<br/>
<br/>
The end of my journey was near and I could see the long day coming to an en=<br/>
d. <br/>
The road was climbing slightly and I was I very tired. My gaze was to the <br/>
ground and I saw a tree to the East obviously agreeing with me and yawning.=<br/>
 I <br/>
had to investigate and it looked like a good place to curl up in. While I s=<br/>
niffed <br/>
around it, something suddenly caught my attention. Off I went at 240 degree=<br/>
s. <br/>
You'd think that with all these trees any dog would be in her glory, but li=<br/>
ke I <br/>
told you red was my favorite color.<br/>
