'mediums' (Im very new and am still learning and experimenting)<br/>
<br/>
I've grown fond of Magic Rub erasers.  My local Office Max sells a package <br/>
of 3 for ~$1.50.  This is great because as a beginner, I'll often go thru a <br/>
few 'drafts' before coming to a final stamp Im happy with.<br/>
<br/>
Often times my creativity is larger the my eraser, so then I use Speedy <br/>
Stamp (the pink stuff NOT the white).   It's a little 'tougher' to cut <br/>
(gotta use a very sharp blade) but it holds up well to wear... and I get <br/>
more size and dimention options for my work.<br/>

Hello everybody,<br/>
<br/>
I just started the art of stamp carving and carved my first image<br/>
from a Staedtler Mars Plastic eraser.<br/>
<br/>
What brand of eraser's do you other carvers out there recommend?<br/>
Also, where do you buy your supply and how much should they cost?<br/>
<br/>
I'd appreciate any information along these lines anyone would be<br/>
willing to share.  We are working on getting our first Letterbox<br/>
series out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

shortly available will be the link to my stamp carving<br/>
page. I do not show to much of my stamp art as I<br/>
prefer people to find them in the boxes that I place,<br/>
but it does have many helpful hints and a couple of<br/>
links for stamp carvers of all levels. Ill let you<br/>
know when the link becomes available.<br/>
