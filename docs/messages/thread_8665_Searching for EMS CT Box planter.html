We passed each other once and when passing again later on, I asked what he was doing with sheets of paper in the woods. I was told a little about letterboxing and that there was one in a wall nearby. I knew how long it was when I first saw him and I knew there were only a couple walls that came up to the trail. So I went to my first guess and found the box. The box had a letterboxing fact sheet. I took a copy and was letterboxing in a few days.Looking back, I kind of remember your stamp in the book, so I'm guessing it was you that got me started letterboxing along with Leader of the Pack's fact sheet.....Chuck and Molly
