Title:	Curtain Up Letterbox (an outdoor comedy/drama [that depends   on <br/>
you!] in four acts, featuring an easy walk and easy clues complete with <br/>
glossary of theatrical terms)<br/>
<br/>
Setting:	Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts, Vienna, VA.  <br/>
Mornings or matinees any day of the year as the park closes at dark.<br/>
(Please note that admittance to the park may be limited during actual Filene <br/>
Center or Theater in the Woods performances)<br/>
<br/>
Admission:	Free to letterboxers old and young.<br/>
<br/>
Playwright:	 BeMa<br/>
<br/>
Premiere:	November 20, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Prologue:	Wolf Trap is Americas National Park for the Performing Arts.  <br/>
The 100 acres of grounds is a nice place to picnic or roll down a hill.  It <br/>
is also home to the 6,800-seat indoor/outdoor theater, the Filene Center.  <br/>
During the summer, you can buy either the cheap lawn seats or the reasonably <br/>
priced indoor seats and listen to a wide variety of music, theater, opera <br/>
and multimedia presentations.  Wolf Trap also features a special theater, <br/>
dedicated to performances for children.  At the end of each summer, the <br/>
meadow is the scene for an international childrens festival, complete with <br/>
Bob from Sesame Street.<br/>
<br/>
Wolf Trap is right off the Dulles Toll Road.  There is ample parking <br/>
available in the lot.  You may also save yourself the walk up the hill by <br/>
parking in the limited spaces available by the box office.<br/>
<br/>
Act I:  The Set Up<br/>
Scene I<br/>
<br/>
Chorus:	You have all been cast in an adventure in search of the elusive <br/>
Curtain Up Letterbox.  There will be no techs to help you as you descend <br/>
mighty mountains, cross vast plains and forge great waters (o.k. so thats a <br/>
slight exaggeration).  The path is easy, the way is clear (and there are <br/>
lots of bathrooms along the way).  Go, hit your mark and break a leg!<br/>
Act II:  The Journey<br/>
<br/>
At the top of the hill collect the props you will need for this performance: <br/>
  a compass, the clues, the glossary and your other letterboxing <br/>
paraphernalia.  Pass by the Will Call box office on the left and enter <br/>
through the ticket gates toward the Filene Center.  Proceed to the left of <br/>
the outdoor theater lobby, passing the entrance for Section A.  Passing this <br/>
gangway, go down the set of stairs following the signs to the restrooms.  <br/>
Pass one set of bathrooms (mens room) on the left and continue down the <br/>
stairs following more restroom signs.  Continuing downhill, cut across the <br/>
little grass hill following more restroom arrow signs.  Go on the cement <br/>
path, which quickly leads to the asphalt drive toward the back of the Filene <br/>
Center.  Take a left and head across the grassy meadow, passing a whole <br/>
building of bathrooms (men, women and unisex).  Aim for the bridge ahead, <br/>
passing by birdfeeder #2.  Cross the bridge and take the gravel path to the <br/>
left.  Follow the path along the river a short distance until you see an <br/>
informational display sign, telling about the forests of Wolf Trap.  Face <br/>
that sign and take the path to your left.  Pass the following signs <br/>
identifying the following trees, acting as spear carriers along the path:  <br/>
the American Holly, Mountain Laurel, White Oak, Tulip Poplar, Northern Red <br/>
Oak, Chestnut Oak, Flowering Dogwood, Ironwood and Flowering Azalea that <br/>
line both sides of the path.  At the T, continue to the right.<br/>
<br/>
Act III:  The arrival at the Show<br/>
<br/>
In the clearing ahead is the Theater in the Woods.  Become part of the house <br/>
and let a member or two of your company entertain you upon the boards.  <br/>
There is no time for a dress rehearsal  beginners to their places.  Enjoy <br/>
the adlibs and asides, prompting the cast and cueing any special effects, <br/>
while they chew the scenery.  Once the run of their show has come to an <br/>
end, let the cast enjoy its curtain call.  When the echoes of all the bravos <br/>
and encores have faded away, join them on the stage and exit, stage left <br/>
through the wooden wings to the greenroom.<br/>
<br/>
Go out the imaginary stage door at the back of the theater, down the <br/>
backstage stairs and spot a tree to your right.<br/>
<br/>
Act IV:  The Denouement<br/>
<br/>
Starting from that tree, head off in a northerly direction for 29 steps, <br/>
into the woods.  There you will spot a natural version of the theater you <br/>
have just left.  The stage is a big piece cut piece of log, standing on its <br/>
end, mimicking a stage.  Before it are other cut sections of logs shaped in <br/>
a V reminiscent of the seats.  Look at the apex of the V in the SRO <br/>
section, if you will, under some smaller logs and leaves for the leading <br/>
role of the show, the Curtain Up Letterbox.  Curtain falls.  The cheering <br/>
is wild!  Take your bows.  Curtain falls.  Bring up the house lights.  <br/>
You've starred in another successful show and a stamp in your own special <br/>
Playbill to commemorate it.<br/>
