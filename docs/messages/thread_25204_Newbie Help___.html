Hey y'all.  I just discovered letterboxing, and I'm anxious to get<br/>
started, but I am having trouble with a trail name and a stamp design. <br/>
I want both to be original and "me", but I'm just getting started, so I<br/>
don't want to go to a lot of expense until I see if this is for me!  I<br/>
went to my local hobby store yesterday to check out stamps, but nothing<br/>
grabbed me.  Can I ask for some examples of stamps that you all use, and<br/>
the sizes?  As for the trail name, I guess I will ask for some<br/>
suggestions from my friends.<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated!<br/>
<br/>

My first stamp lasted about a year and then broke. My second stamp was made using a white eraser, about 1.5 x 2 in. I made a smaller one when I started making letterbox trading cards--it's also handy for smaller logbooks! <br/>

All of my stamps have been a simple cat face, using brown ink, because I'm <br/>

My trail name is pjynx because that's what I've used for years as my login for various messageboards (my first initial is P and our last name is jenks, which sometimes sounds like jynx). My stamp is a wine bottle and wine glass, because, well....i like wine ;o)<br/>

My daughter's trail name is Lulu because that's what we used to call her when she was little. Her stamp is a the happy/sad pair of drama masks with a crown above them because she's a drama queen ;o)<br/>
<br/>
When we first started out, we just used a couple of store-bought stamps that I had in my scrapbooking supplies, only because we weren't sure yet what we wanted our stamps to be and because I wasn't daring enough yet to carve one myself.<br/>
