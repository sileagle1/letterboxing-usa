POLL QUESTION: I think the list  <br/>
<br/>
CHOICES AND RESULTS<br/>
- is operating basically fine considering the number and diversity of members, 19 votes, 40.43%  <br/>
- could be better but what can the moderators do about 1400 different people, 4 votes, 8.51%  <br/>
- should be managed in a less laissez-faire manner, 1 votes, 2.13%  <br/>
- should be downright moderated by secret though police, 1 votes, 2.13%  <br/>
- would be fine if people would simply lighten up a bit, 21 votes, 44.68%  <br/>
- would be fine if certain people were voted off the island, and I have sent the list manager links to their offensive messages, 0 votes, 0.00%  <br/>
- would be fine if the moderators followed my suggestion which I have forwarded to the list manager, 0 votes, 0.00%  <br/>

- Plant letterboxes in areas where other recreation takes place so I can combine activities and save gas., 2 votes, 5.41%  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
POLL QUESTION: In a recent poll, 29% of repondents said high fuel <br/>

they would combine letterboxing with other activities to limit travel, <br/>
19% said they would letterbox closer to home, 8% said they would <br/>
letterbox less often, and 1% would use other forms of transportation.<br/>

Since fuel prices seem to be affecting the majority, how would you <br/>
prefer that those who plant letterboxes plant future ones to help you <br/>
out?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Y'know, the odd thing letterboxing has done in Caveman's and my lives is to<br/>
totally change our retirement plans just because of this.<br/>
<br/>
I'm one of those for whom it's been 90% all about the stamp.  Only about 10%<br/>
or so is about the clues, the hike, the history, etc (so shoot me).  On the<br/>
other hand, I don't consider postal letterboxing to be twue letterboxing (so<br/>
shoot me again).<br/>
<br/>
But, for me, there are very very very (can't put enough verys in there) few<br/>
places to plant boxes in northeastern IL where it can be said that "it's all<br/>
about the hike."   There are too many beautiful scenic places in this<br/>
country where it could twuly be said that, even if the box was missing, it<br/>
was well worth the hike anyway, and they make Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana,<br/>
look pretty dismal to Caveman and me.  Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Iowa,<br/>
Missouri, etal.......they're "pretty", sometimes "very pretty."  But there's<br/>
nothing "twuly awesome."<br/>
<br/>
I hit 55 last October, meaning I was eligible to retire last October.<br/>
(Caveman's already retired.) Problem is getting a decent price for the house<br/>
right now.  Real estate folks around here say that ain't gonna happen until<br/>
probably 2009, maybe even 2010.  But who knows?<br/>
<br/>
I haven't been able to get at all enthusiastic about planting new boxes this<br/>
year in Kane County, DeKalb County, DuPage County, Cook County.  And I'm not<br/>
getting burned out on boxing -- not in the least -- I'm getting burned out<br/>
on the fact that the Smokey Mountains have absolutely fantastic places to<br/>
plant boxes and I'm not in the Smokey Mountains!  Bummer!<br/>
<br/>
So we're horribly seriously looking into dragging ourselves, 4 dogs, 2<br/>
bunnies, and 3 Timbrado canaries down to the Smokey Mountains and retiring<br/>
there.  Or someplace close enough to them so that we can reach them in a<br/>
relatively short drive.  Caveman says he'd even be happy in a double-wide,<br/>
tho I have my doubts that the furkids would be happy with that arrangement.<br/>
Moving to Tennessee for the awesome letterboxing potential......for the<br/>
awesome letterboxing potential......the awesome letterboxing potential.<br/>
Makes total sense to us.<br/>

final results: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
POLL QUESTION: Since we can't seem to stop bickering about this, or at least let it go, how about we settle this once and for all. Vote on whether you would like to see a review feature similar to the geocaching site on LbNA. Then everyone regardless of which side they are on will be a grown up and quietly accept that the majority disagrees with them nor will the persons holding the opposing view gloat.<br/>
<br/>
Before voting take time to review this thread so that you are fully informed (and you will be) about both sides of this disagreement. Think about your vote and don't react emotionally to any percieved slights or petty nastiness on either side of the argument, how you feel about someone manners or personality is not the issue here. <br/>
<br/>
CHOICES AND RESULTS<br/>
- yes I would like to see a review feature similar to that on the geocaching site added to LbNA, 33 votes, 19.76%  <br/>
- No I would not  like to see a review feature similar to that on the geocaching site added to LbNA, 134 votes, 80.24%  <br/>
