letterbox).  We tried to make the clue/map easy.  Let me know if <br/>
anyone has troubled hunting...<br/>
<br/>
1. Anglers' Lodge Casting Pools (go there)<br/>
2. Find the aquaduct trail, between the doghouse and "horner's <br/>
corner" (hint: west side of pools, aquaduct starts about 10/15 feet <br/>
down trail, and trail follows it for most part)<br/>
3. Mosey down the trail, past and around the giant eucalyptus, to the <br/>
clearing where a fallen tree lies to your right (hint: this is about <br/>
90 paces/steps from the trail's start at the pool's edge)<br/>
4. At the clearing, turn to your left, following a trail southward.  <br/>
Go about 40 paces and vere left onto the trail leading up over a <br/>
small hill - groundswell, i'd call it.<br/>
5. Almost there... at the top of the mount there is a tree on the <br/>
very right edge of the trail.  Pass it.  The next tree on the very <br/>
right edge of the trail is home to "leafy" letterbox.<br/>
6. At the bottom of the tree trunk (a very tall one) is a hole.  <br/>
Stick your arm in and dig out a little dirt.  Grab the letterbox, too.<br/>
<br/>
We are going to add a few tiny swapping items today, and right now <br/>
there's just the box's stamp, inkpad and small notebook.  It's a <br/>
small box.  Swap anything except for the stamp, inkpad and notebook <br/>
(someone took the stamp from the last box we found, please don't take <br/>
ours!  Besides, I cut my finger making it so it'll bring bad luck if <br/>
you do.)    <br/>
