The Woodcraft store near me has the 0.5 mm Pfeil gouge in the catalog, but <br/>
not in the store.  They do carry the Flexcut palm tool in 1.0 mm gouge.  Can <br/>
anyone let me know whether they feel this tool is more accurate and gets better <br/>
detail than the Speedball size 1 gouge?<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm looking to hear about someone's experience with a 1 mm tool other <br/>
than the Speedball gouge, and anything about any brand of 0.5 mm gouge <br/>
(brand, purchasing source, satisfaction with blade?).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for helping out a new carver!<br/>

&gt; Dear Sir Balthazar, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   THANK YOU SO MUCH for your kindness! Your words, "Everybody has <br/>
&gt; the right to be new." really touched me! I was beginning to feel a <br/>
&gt; little like a untalented hanger-on, in a semi-closed group of <br/>
&gt; experts. ;)<br/>
&gt; I think it's either going to take a lot more practice, or else the <br/>
&gt; luck of finding someone nearby who makes stamps and be able <br/>
&gt; to 'carve with them' awhile - or BOTH! <br/>
&gt; I was wishing that it was more like the CT area, here... SO many <br/>
&gt; letterboxes all over the place, and so many letterboxers. That does <br/>
&gt; sound wonderful. But with the setback of my carving dissatisfaction, <br/>
&gt; it will take me awhile to be able to plant many boxes anyway... I <br/>
&gt; will have plenty to keep me busy!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks again for your help and wisdom.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; Dear Wanda,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Everybody has the right to be new. Some of the fun of this craft <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; improving in skill, as well as the art. Whatever it looks like <br/>
&gt; now, <br/>
&gt; &gt; make the next one better. Keep on trying. You are doing stuff that <br/>
&gt; &gt; very few folks ever attempt.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Correct tools is vital for this. Honestly, you skimp on tools at <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; risk of getting discouraged and quitting.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The Speedball carving set with about four gouges in it is fine. I <br/>
&gt; do <br/>
&gt; &gt; not know how other folks do it with Xacto Blades but the gouges <br/>
&gt; are <br/>
&gt; &gt; meant for the kind of work we do. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I recently bought a Two Cherries 0.5 mm gouge. It is immensely <br/>
&gt; &gt; satisfying to use. The tip is only a third as wide as the smallest <br/>
&gt; &gt; Speedball one. It is pricey, however; I spent about $32 on the one <br/>
&gt; &gt; gouge. <br/>

Mountain Heritage Crafters carries both the straight and the sweep <br/>
0.5 mm gouge. Here is the link for the sweep; I use the straight:<br/>

<br/>
Just google 0.5mm micro carving   and see what you can find. The <br/>
number one Speedball is 1.5 mm or so. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

im still bumping along with the number 11 exacto<br/>
blades... but i was an art major and am a penny<br/>
pincher and can get away with it.<br/>
in the tidewater area try eageltons on boush street,<br/>
norfolk va. in my browsings they have always had<br/>
everything to do anything with art, and those are more<br/>
traditionally linoleum block or wood block carving<br/>
tools, so they should have SOMETHING usefull. and<br/>
while in the area, the odu gallery has an exhibit<br/>
running "press the flesh" focusing on printmaking. i<br/>
havent been there yet, and i am kinda wondering about<br/>
the content (as fer as younger viewers goes) but it<br/>
might be interesting as far as technique and style. i<br/>
think it is running untill august 12th or 22nd, has<br/>
been mentioned in the entertainment section of the<br/>
paper. there are at least 3 boxes nearby.<br/>
fun boxing!<br/>
