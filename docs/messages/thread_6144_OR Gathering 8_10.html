The Gathering approaches! Hopefully some of you enthusiastic<br/>
letterboxers from the land of Microsoft and Designer Coffee will be able<br/>
to make it on down. Your names are familiar but faces nonexistent. We<br/>
will be meeting noonish for a picnic lunch at Upper Macleay Park in NW<br/>
Portland. Bring a blanket or chairs as tables are limited and there is<br/>
no guarantee that we'll get even one. A number of new boxes will be<br/>
hidden specifically for this event with clues available at lunch.  We<br/>
will also be in close proximity to the Who Let the Dogs Out? and What's<br/>
for Dinner? series. See you there. Funhog<br/>

Since we don't really know who or how many it seems as though it would<br/>
be a lot easier if we all brought our own brown bags. Now if you have<br/>
a fabulous Jello mold or tuna noodle casserole you're just dying to<br/>
share bring it on. Otherwise, just bring something that ants like.<br/>
They ARE mandatory at all picnics, aren't they? Funhog<br/>
