                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was re-watching the prison movie Shawshank Redemption, and I got to <br/>
a certain part where the main character, Andy, is talking to his <br/>
friend, Red.  He says, "Red, if you ever get out of here, do me a <br/>
favor. There's this big hayfield up near Buxton [Maine]....Got a long <br/>
rock wall with a big oak at the north end. Like something out of a <br/>
Robert Frost poem. It's where I asked my wife to marry me.... Promise <br/>
me, Red. If you ever get out, find that spot. In the base of that <br/>
wall you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine <br/>
hayfield. A piece of black volcanic glass. You'll find something <br/>
buried under it I want you to have."  <br/>
<br/>
Red replies, "What? What's buried there?"  <br/>
<br/>
Andy answers, "You'll just have to pry up that rock and see."<br/>
<br/>
Later on, when Red gets out of prison, he goes and finds the spot.  <br/>
Under the rock he finds a box.<br/>
<br/>
I won't tell you what was inside, or spoil the rest of the movie for <br/>
you if you haven't seen it (and you should see it; it's one of the <br/>
best I've ever seen).  If you have seen the movie, you'll remember.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose this qualifies as a "word-of-mouth" clue, doesn't it?  <br/>
Anybody up in Maine want to put together a "Shawshank" letterbox that <br/>
fits the clues from the movie?  There's already a box in CT <br/>
called "HOPE -- The Shawshank Redemption" but it doesn't quite follow <br/>
the movie's clues.<br/>
