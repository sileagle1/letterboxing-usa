                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just got back from Christmas vacation and tried to hit a few boxes along<br/>
the way.  We tried Pinnacle Mountain in Jasper, Arkansas on Dec 20th.  It<br/>
was no where to be found.  We spent about an hour and a half on top of the<br/>
mountain inspecting every clump of trees there was.  For the next intrepid<br/>
soul who attempts this one, the East trail is very difficult and you will<br/>
need pretty good shoes for either one.  We went up the East and decided to<br/>
go down the West side and walk around the mountain back to our car.  I was<br/>
foolish enough to think State park, handicapped accessible and wore my<br/>
sandals which turned out to have very slippery bottoms.  Huge mistake.  My<br/>
knees hurt for a week from all the times I landed on them.  The box owner<br/>
may want to go check on this one to see if I was just unlucky or if the box<br/>
is really gone.<br/>
