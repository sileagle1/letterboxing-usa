The "Comanche" letterbox is located in Old Fort Parker State <br/>
Historical Park.  This stamp pays tribute to the Parker Family <br/>
tragedy, and eventual blood line leader of the Comanche Indians.  On <br/>
May 19, 1836, Cynthia Ann Parker was abducted during an Indian raid <br/>
of her family's compound (or Fort) at this location.  She was raised <br/>
by the Indians, and eventually accepted their lifestyle, having <br/>
children with a Comanche chief.  In 1860, Texas Rangers captured <br/>
Cynthia and her daughter Prairie Flower, and returned her to the <br/>
Parker family.  He daughter soon died, and as did Cynthia.  Her son, <br/>
Quanah, eventually became chief of the Comanche tribe, and led his <br/>
tribe into its last battles with the Texans.  After surrendering, he <br/>
took on the sir name of his mother (Parker), and became instrumental <br/>
in conforming his band into the lifestyle of the white man.<br/>
