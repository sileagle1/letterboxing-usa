post before Thanksgiving! (I actually tried to post this message last<br/>
week while stopping off at the library in East Hampton,CT just before<br/>
it closed, but somehow couldn't get onto this talklist!) Anyway, I<br/>
just wanted to say that a while back Pete had posted a little<br/>
"wrap-up" of our past year's letterboxing adventures on our webpage.<br/>
In case anyone is interested in reading it, it's on the left side at <br/>
http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html<br/>
<br/>
We've also been hitting a few other milestones recently, in addition<br/>
to PFX 10,000 at "Trek to Destiny" at Hartman Park in Lyme,CT on<br/>
Oct.29th, including my 1000th "exchange", with Leafcutters of<br/>
Sellersville, PA, on Oct. 15th at "Boxtoberfest" in NJ, and my 9000th<br/>
"find", with "Clarence the Angel", while visiting with WarriorWoman<br/>
just this past Saturday!!! And hopefully we'll be reaching our 150th<br/>
"place" this weekend, as we go off to plant some "Holiday Leftovers"!<br/>
We truly are thankful for all the wonderful people out there who have<br/>
chosen to play this little game of ours with such open, generous,<br/>
warm-spirited camaraderie! (To think, it could long ago have devolved<br/>
into just little groups of "elitists" playing "keep-away",or jealously<br/>
guarding "exclusivity" in vain attempts to establish "superiority",<br/>
had it not been for the vast majority of you wonderful letterboxers!)<br/>
So, once again - a big thank you to all who have "played a good game".<br/>
Thanks for the boxes, thanks for the memories, and Happy Thanksgiving!<br/>
