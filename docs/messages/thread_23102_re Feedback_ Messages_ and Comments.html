We SO agree! All the comments you'd ever want are right there in your <br/>
logbooks, in the glorious wintery outdoors, just waiting for a visit. Online comments <br/>
are a geocaching thing. Letterboxing is meant to be a bit more elegant. You <br/>
know that old bumper sticker, "Kill Your TV?" Letterboxing means being creative <br/>
away from all the electronic noise we're surrounded by. It gets us together <br/>
with family and friends, carving, book binding, clue writing, and hiking. <br/>
Spending time all alone reading and writing online comments is just like staring at <br/>
the boob tube. Dump that TV mentality and do something refreshingly low tech! <br/>
If these are TV shows, geocaching is American Idol while letterboxing is <br/>
Masterpiece Theater. So, Kill Your Computer and just get out there and box ;)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As much fun as finding the letterbox for me is reading through the sign-in  <br/>
journals.  I have never met any of the people in the logs yet because I am  <br/>
relatively new to letterboxing but I just love sitting on a rock and reading the  <br/>
comments.  If people didn't write little messages into the logs because  they <br/>
knew that they were going to go home and do it on the computer , it would  <br/>
take something away from the whole experience.  <br/>
<br/>
I am really close to finding my 50th box, which is a big deal for me  because <br/>
I have a 2 and 4 year-old who go with me on a lot of my  adventures.  We are <br/>
going to have a party to celebrate and I am thinking of  creating a <br/>
family/friends "Letterboxing Day" this summer since I've gotten my  nephews hooked  on <br/>
this great hobby as well and it would be a great  day of getting the whole clan <br/>
together from different states to find some  boxes and share our journals.  <br/>
Is there any such thing as a National or  International Day of Letterboxing or <br/>
should I just pick a date?<br/>
Take care everyone....for you New England people...spring is just around  the <br/>
corner.  I boxed up in North Conway, NH at the beginning of the week  and <br/>
found a box frozen into it's rocky hiding place.  We really had to work  for it.<br/>

 I have finally gotten 100-- some from NH where my daughter lives and I have <br/>
planted some there too.  My daughters are 34 &amp;41 and they box with me too.  <br/>
Since they feel they must pick up the box and direct the signing in- process, I <br/>
sometime don't get to read the messages or look  at the sign in stamps.  That <br/>
is very annoying and disappointing.  That happens mostly when it is cold.  <br/>
It's good to have them with me to share this hobby.  I found it and passed it on <br/>
to all my children and grandchildren.<br/>
