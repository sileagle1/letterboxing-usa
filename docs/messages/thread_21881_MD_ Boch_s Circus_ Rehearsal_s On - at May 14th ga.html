                    <div class="plaintext-content">The train has been arriving full of wonders for our fledgling <br/>
Circus. A large crowd attracted my attention which I discovered <br/>
surrounded "Angelina, the Hirsute Beauty" (by TeamTiredFeet). <br/>
Beautiful, voluptuous, and um, such hair; the bearded lady exhibited <br/>
the most astonishing detail and attention in her costume and <br/>
appearance. <br/>
<br/>
Yet we also turned in awe at the commotion offloading the <br/>
magnificent, "Magical Liberty Horse" (by TeamTiredFeet). Her brushed <br/>
hair, her flying plumes, simply astounding. I promise you you have <br/>
never seen any performance finer. <br/>
<br/>
I turned around and thought I had walked into the jungle. I marvel <br/>
at the courage, fortitude, and skill attaining a great wild "Tiger" <br/>
(by Girlguides) for our nascent troupe. Men will gape, mothers will <br/>
gasp and grasp their small wide eyed children. "Gee boss, he sure <br/>
looks tame to me." "Shushhh." Be not fooled by this Tiger's friendly <br/>
and docile appearance. I assure you he has sharp teeth, stong legs, <br/>
and ripping claws. Such excellent guides. <br/>
<br/>
I, and my partner and elephant handler, the inimitable Tempus Fugit, <br/>
spent this past weekend escorting several of these performances to <br/>
their temporary home, planted in the forest of Black Hills Regional <br/>
Park where they are rehearsing even now.  Alas their accomodations <br/>
are not the best as there is no Douggerware to be had in this area <br/>
to my knowledge.  <br/>
<br/>
I have heard from some others who are finalizing their performances <br/>
or are in transit. It is with the greatest anticipation that I await <br/>
more arrivals. Many thanks for all efforts. <br/>
<br/>
Dress Rehearsals Soon! <br/>
<br/>
Yours most truly and sincerely, your humble Ringmaster, <br/>
