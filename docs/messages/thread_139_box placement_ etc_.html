                    <div class="plaintext-content">Please re-read below how Thom camouflaged his letterbox.  I dunno<br/>
about the rest of you but I think this is a great idea.  I have <br/>
2 of my boxes (at Ft. Snelling, MN) tied with fish line around<br/>
a tree trunk and a tree.  Then I threw a little dried grass and<br/>
leaves on top of them.  But I used that monofilament line that<br/>
sort of flouresces in the sunlight (easy to spot).  And I'm afraid<br/>
with a little wind the cover may blow away also.  Its also in a<br/>
flood plane so anything can happen.  My boxes are clear plastic<br/>
jars with colored lids.  They are water tight and that's an<br/>
advantage considering the location, but it would be much nicer<br/>
if the lids were more earth-toned rather than bright blue and<br/>
red.  Well, I guess there's a whole lot more to consider in box<br/>
design, placement, etc., esp. if we want them to blend better<br/>
with the environment. <br/>

&gt;  I tied a 2' length of 20# fishing monofilament with a good<br/>

&gt;  knot) a wood plug I whittled from a twig.  It doesn't have to be<br/>
&gt;  anything fancy, but it should blend in with the background &amp; have some<br/>
&gt;  kind of groove so the fishing line won't slip off.  On location, I drop<br/>
&gt;  the letterbox into the hole and hook the plug over a small branch<br/>
&gt;  growing nearby.  You might want to scout your intended spot before<br/>
&gt;  snipping your fishing line to any length.  Anyway, my box is suspended<br/>
&gt;  in the hole of this tree below eye level.<br/>

My personal concerns about monofilament is a) the possibility<br/>
of wildlife getting tangled in it, or b) the possibility of people<br/>
running through the woods off trail (like us orienteers) tripping<br/>
over it (this has happened to me with steel wire in the past twice<br/>
while orienteering).  I think I'll experiment with out of the way <br/>
hiding places for now and see how it goes :-)<br/>

just enough slack that you can position the box to be opened.<br/>
This is a good point you make though Randy.  So to all: Be sure<br/>
if you plan to use fish line that you do as I have done and NOT<br/>
create a tripping hazard.  Thank you for making that point Randy.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Responding to the question of suspending  a letterbox with monofilament,<br/>
inside something which (I assume) one can't reach to the bottom of...<br/>
<br/>
An anecdote from the past, if you'll pardon the diversion... <br/>
<br/>
Back in the mid 60's, my best friend and I were finishing high school,<br/>
and were planning grand life schemes, and decided, one night, to make a<br/>
sort of "brotherhood pledge" about these schemes, that we would come<br/>
back to in a couple of years. Well, we needed to assure ourselves that<br/>
it would be available to us no matter what happened (i.e., it had to<br/>
survive through flood, fire, family moves, etc.), so, we wrote and<br/>
signed this document, and sealed it in a glass cigar tube (like a test<br/>
tube), with cork and wax, and suspended it, by monofilament, under cover<br/>
of darkness one night, inside the pipe of a signpost on our town green.<br/>
	 Late one night a couple of years later, somewhat longer in hair and<br/>
scruffier in appearance, my friend decided to check on it, and was<br/>
standing on the seat of his motorcycle (this is about 1967,), having<br/>
pulled the sign off the top, peering down the pipe, when along comes a<br/>
cop (a former classmate of mine, trying to sound tough) in a cruiser.<br/>
"Young Man, what do you think you are doing?" says he. "Oh Officer, I'm<br/>
just checking on my time capsule" says my friend. Well, he was told in<br/>
no uncertain terms to put the sign back and leave.<br/>
	Several days later my friend sneaked back to repeat the quest - the<br/>
capsule was gone! It had been there just a few nights before!  Nothing<br/>
else was disturbed, and a flashlight showed that the capsuile had not<br/>
fallen down to the base of the post. <br/>
	We tried to figure out what could possibly have happened, and finally,<br/>
concluded that the same cop probably suspected we were really hiding our<br/>
"stash" there, told his superiors about it,  but, after recovering it,<br/>
was too chagrined to admit it, and so destroyed it. <br/>
<br/>
	Actualy, we never had a plan for retreiving the capsule, should the<br/>
monofilament indeed have failed and the capsule fallen to the base of<br/>
the post. I guess I'd be a bit concerned about a similar occurence<br/>
(minus the police involvement, hopefully), if a letterbox hunter didn't<br/>
quite get the knot right, etc. However, I do think it is a great concept<br/>
if it can be made fail-safe.<br/>
<br/>
	And, in the spirit of things past and present, I sent that friend a<br/>
letterbox kit for Christmas. So it goes full circle.<br/>
