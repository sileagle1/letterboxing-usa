were successful 2 out of 3 tries.  We were able to find the Paint<br/>
Works and Terra Cotta Tangram (with directions to the ruins from a<br/>
very nice policeman in the Wawa nearby).  What a wonderful concept! <br/>
We really enjoyed that series, as well as intriguing a few local<br/>
paintballers.  I also enjoyed popping all of the "unused" paintballs<br/>
laying around - of course spraying myself more than once in the<br/>
process.  Just like a kid stepping in puddles!  We then tried for the<br/>
box in Double Trouble SP, but were unsuccessful.  We thought we were<br/>
in the right spot, but it was raining and starting to get dark.  Has<br/>
anyone gotten that box recently?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
