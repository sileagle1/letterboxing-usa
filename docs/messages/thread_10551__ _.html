"High Flight"</p><br/>
<br/>
<b>Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of earth<br/>
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;<br/>
Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth<br/>
Of sun-split clouds - and done a hundred things<br/>
You have not dreamed of - wheeled and soared and swung<br/>
High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there,<br/>
I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung<br/>
My eager craft through footless halls of air.<br/>
Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue<br/>
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace<br/>
Where never lark, or even eagle flew -<br/>
And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod<br/>
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,<br/>
Put out my hand and touched the face of God.</b><br/>
