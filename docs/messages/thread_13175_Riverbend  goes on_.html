it after all! Missed out on the Gerbil Gathering  and Pete couldn't <br/>
take off time for the Great Lakes Gathering, or even just Friday to <br/>
get to VA, but perhaps I can still get myself down there for the get-<br/>
together on Saturday! Hope to meet a lot of you folks, and I'll bring <br/>
a hitcher or two! Just please realize that getting that close to a <br/>
city, out of the woods and without Pete, I'll probably be a "basket <br/>
case" myself, so I just hope someone points me in the right <br/>
direction!!!<br/>

dates I thought, oh no there goes my exchange with you. If you can <br/>
make from GA to ME than this should be a BREEZE :-) From DC/Dulles go <br/>
west. Balto. head south then west. <br/>
