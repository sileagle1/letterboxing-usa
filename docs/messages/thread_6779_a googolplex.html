 A Googolplex, Cool! Mom never told me about that. I keep on telling <br/>
her that after a googol there are a hundred googols and then comes <br/>
infinity. <br/>
<br/>
Now as you stated, there isn't a googol of ANYTHING out there. <br/>

F8 (soon to change)P2 B2 L a googol<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; i'm sure lizzardbutt knows for sure, but i think that if every bit <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; space in the known universe (and there is A LOT of empty space) <br/>
were <br/>
&gt; COMPLETELY filled with electrons (and they're pretty SMALL), the <br/>
&gt; total number of electrons would be quite a bit less than a <br/>
&gt; googolplex...<br/>
