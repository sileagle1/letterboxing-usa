I was checking on a number of the John Bryan Park boxes yesterday and <br/>
where I had expected to find the Blue Hole, I found a smashed box, 4 <br/>
quarters, a wet log, and a note.  <br/>
<br/>
The note is as follows:<br/>
March 19,<br/>
Searching for Amy - Sarah &amp; Hallie<br/>
P.S. we bought you stamp. Maybe some day we'll bring it back.<br/>
<br/>
The box was visited on 23 Feb by franzsolo, to whom I would not give <br/>
any clues about the shavian, and on 19 March by Zoe.<br/>
<br/>
I have updated the page for Blue Hole to note its absence.<br/>

<br/>
I was reminded about the vapor pressure of stamps...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Rick, Glad to see you have time to get  back in the woods to  letterbox<br/>
a little.<br/>
Man i looked all over that tree for the  #2 cocoon.But at the time the<br/>
sun was right in my face.! I must have looked for a half hour or more .A<br/>
good hide on that one. Glad it's not MIA.<br/>
<br/>
Oh Crap !!.....another stamp (box ) bites the dust. <br/>
That was a 2 hour labor of love ....But fun to carve. he he....<br/>
That's what I get for carving an elaborate stamp !!<br/>
<br/>
All the boxes by the river I had out are OK. Water didn't get to them.<br/>
<br/>
I think I must do a few Hybrid geo / letterboxes for the coming<br/>
spring.And see if I can sway a few geocachers to 'boxing ..<br/>
ive gotten to the point that if a geocache is in a weird place ,or not<br/>
in a park. i dont even bother looking for it.they are placing them at<br/>
Expressway ramps and parking garages.<br/>
Im off to place a couple boxes today....I hope.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to see Geoff approched you for an interview !!<br/>
Later,<br/>
John<br/>
