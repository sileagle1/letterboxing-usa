Location: Near ??  Clark County OH<br/>
Difficulty 1.5  <br/>
Placed 29 Nov 2001 <br/>

Out in the Ohio farmland is a great spot to take your family and have <br/>
some cheap fun.  The name of this place is rather out of place, <br/>
considering how old the main building is (built 1869).  The group <br/>
there now gets involved in many charity causes.  They are one of the <br/>
major sponsors of a 150-mile bike ride for MS.  They also have a <br/>
charity art contest and auction known as Udder Chaos.  <br/>
<br/>
Go to this location, buy a milkshake, (Listed in the January 2001 <br/>
Ohio Magazine as the best in Ohio) and then go feed the goats.  While <br/>
you are there, pace off the fence around the goat pen.  You will need <br/>
to know this number of paces a little later.  Call it the GPM  Goat <br/>
Pen Margin.<br/>
<br/>
When you finish your activities at this place, get in the car and <br/>
head 45 degrees on the state route for 3.4 miles until you reach a <br/>
road we will just call S-X.  Take S-X for 0.3 miles and park in the <br/>
public lot next to an asphalt trail.  <br/>
<br/>
Time to work off those empty calories!  Starting where the two <br/>
asphalt paths meet, head off at 40 degrees for 130 paces.  (1 pace <br/>
here = 2 steps or about 5 feet) You will arrive at a huge Cottonwood <br/>
tree.  Take another 130 paces and you will see a stump on the right <br/>
side of the path.  From that stump take the GPM pacing you got <br/>
before, and turn your head to the right.  You will be staring at a <br/>
rock on top of a little mound just off the path.  If you lift that <br/>
rock you will show your udder madness.<br/>
