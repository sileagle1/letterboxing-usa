When you pointed out that "Dog friendly" doesn't include other pets, <br/>
I truly thought you were just being obnoxious, I mean, what other pet <br/>
besides dogs can one hike with??? But I was wrong-cats!<br/>
<br/>
 Do they carry them in backpacks? Walk them? Don't the cats hate <br/>
this? I am so amazed.<br/>
<br/>
And the Appalachian Trail is long (as I'm sure you know!) so do they <br/>
camp with them? What if they get loose? Dogs come back, but cats...I <br/>
dunno. <br/>
<br/>
Wow. Hiking with cats. Who knew.<br/>

<br/>
The cat I saw on the AT was always carried on the owner's back, then <br/>
was allowed to run loose while taking a break or at the shelters.<br/>
<br/>
It was very popular among hikers since the cat was great and getting <br/>
rid of the mice in the shelters at night.  That cat may not have <br/>
done much hiking, but it earned its keep.  =)  I've got a picture of <br/>
him and his cat somewhere around here.  *digging around*  Okay, I <br/>
uploaded it to the Photos area.  Check out the last picture.<br/>
<br/>
Another hiker apparently was carrying a real, live turtle, although <br/>
I admit I didn't actually see that personally.<br/>
<br/>
On an unrelated hike, I did once see a ferret being walked on a <br/>
leash. <br/>
<br/>
One person e-mailed me privately about a famous letterboxer in <br/>
England that would take his chicken with him. (Reputedly handy for <br/>
finding those tricky to locate boxes...)<br/>
<br/>
In all honesty, I didn't personally have an issue with the term 'dog <br/>
friendly' just like I don't have an issue with the term 'mailman'.  <br/>
But in this world of political correctness run amok, it doesn't hurt <br/>
to consider such issues.  =)<br/>

she used to follow me out to the bus stop every morning, wanting to go <br/>
