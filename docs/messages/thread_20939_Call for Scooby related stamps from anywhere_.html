Just a reminder we're looking to have a HUGE scooby series attached <br/>
to the one we already have in Fountainhead Park, VA.  The park is <br/>
attached to three other parks and has miles and miles of trails.  The <br/>
more monsters and stuff the better.  If you're interested in carving <br/>
one to put in the series, please contact me at <br/>
justplaingeorge@yahoo.com.<br/>
<br/>
The five main characters and mystery machine are already taken, but <br/>
that still leaves a ton of things to carve!  Right now I think we <br/>
only have six monsters taken.  That leaves many monsters/side <br/>
characters/locations/etc.<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to include a logbook - we'll provide a basic one.  And <br/>
your stamp will be returned to you if the series is ever pulled.  THe <br/>
logbooks will be sent to you as they fill..<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
