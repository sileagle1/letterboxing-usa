                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not sure what's going on either; I'm getting weird gobbledygook messages in my regular inbox as well-- they have no subject, but are addressed to the letterboxing group.  I got the one from Peppermint Patti and Mark and 2 others like that.  My letterboxing messages are all supposed to come into a separate folder I have for letterboxing, and they always have.  I still got them all in that folder as well, but as I said, several appeared in my regular inbox with all kinds of stuff attached.  I don't want to check "no email" since I can't stay online that long to go read all the messages on the site.  The first weird message said "go patriots" and it looked like someone had tried to put a picture with it or something-- it said "banner" or something too.  Anyway, I hope it fixes itself soon.  Must be a Yahoo glitch.  --lunaryakketyact<br/>
