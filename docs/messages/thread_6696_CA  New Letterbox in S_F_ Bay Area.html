<br/>
This is a hike it or bike it, but Lizardbutt says it is better to <br/>
bike it.<br/>
<br/>
Location: Alameda Creek Regional Trial<br/>
Clue difficulty: easy<br/>
Terrain: easy<br/>
Distance: That is up to you.<br/>
Starting point: Coyote Hills Regional Park<br/>
Directions to Coyote Hills can be found at <br/>
www.ebparks.org/parks/coyote.html<br/>
There is a fee for parking. Please park at the visitors center.<br/>
<br/>
This regional park was once home of the Ohlone Indians. It is now <br/>
home for the California quail, numerous waterfowl, and, of course, <br/>
lots of lizards.<br/>
<br/>
Bayview is the way to go.<br/>
Lizards on rocks you will pass.<br/>
Alameda Creek is where you must go.<br/>
Now, away from the bay is the way to go.<br/>
The Corps Of Engineers-US Army have been here, too.<br/>
Close to a bench that makes a great place to rest.<br/>
Now, find the "X" that doesn't mark the spot. <br/>
A grove of eucalyptus trees means you are close.<br/>
<br/>
Stand on the "X".  The visitors center will be at 165 degrees. The <br/>
Indian hut at the historic site is at 140 degrees.  Lizardbutt says <br/>
that the outhouse by the historic site isn't the hut.  Mission Peak <br/>
is at 90 degrees. The box is in front of you, to one side. It is in a <br/>
cradle. Lizardbutt wanted to know if he could eat the nuts.<br/>
<br/>
Please remove the Tupperware container from the cradle.  Do not try <br/>
to remove the cradle and the container. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
After returning to the parking lot, take the time to visit the <br/>
visitors center. In back is a beautiful butterfly garden. Better yet, <br/>
visit the center first.<br/>
