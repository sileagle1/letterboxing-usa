volunteer some info about what types of things people put on their <br/>
stamps?  I know everyone's is unique and that is the whole purpose, <br/>
but while I'm VERY artistic, I usually find picture/graphics I like <br/>
and have been carving them for fun and practice.<br/>
<br/>
Is it a bad idea and/or illegal to use an image in that way?  For <br/>
instance I have found a cartoon that was very special to me as a <br/>
child and would love to use a picture of one of the characters on my <br/>
stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Do many people do this and then add things like names, dates, etc?  <br/>
Or do most of you design something "out of your own head" to use as a <br/>
personal stamp?  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for any contributions!<br/>

Happy Hunting!<br/>

The attachment is a photo from my personal journal and represents<br/>
images I free carved rather than transfer carved.  This means I<br/>
sketched the idea directly on the eraser and then carved it. I use<br/>
these and several others when stamping in and I also use them for<br/>
postcards, one was a christmas card, notes to teachers, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There are millions of clip art images available on the web and books<br/>
of images one can purchase at most bookstores.  Copyright is a tricky<br/>
thing.  You could answer some questions to yourself:  are you<br/>
profiting from it, are you representing it as your own work, are you<br/>
using it as inspiration, are you copying it, are you using it as a<br/>
model?<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, I'm a little ignorant of copyright laws so hence<br/>
my question...<br/>
I assume it's ok to use a store bought stamp that has<br/>
a well known cartoon character on it...as far as<br/>
copyright is that stamp available because the creator<br/>
paid royalties to the owner?  If not (which I assume<br/>
probably is the case) why not be able to carve your<br/>
own?<br/>
<br/>
I'd say go for it- you're not making any money of<br/>
carving the stamp. One of my first forays into this<br/>
was visiting der mad stamper's site where he admits to<br/>
using clip art/cartoons.  I'd never thought about<br/>
copyright laws and their context to letterboxing.  My<br/>
husband carved a really neat Snoopy stamp for my<br/>
beagle when he goes letterboxing with us...never<br/>
thought Buddy would be breaking the laws by using it.<br/>
He ain't nothing but a hound dog, anyway! ;o)<br/>
