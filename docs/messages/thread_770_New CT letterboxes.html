                    <div class="plaintext-content">Happy New Year to all! We had a great new year's eve and managed to get<br/>
in a boxy hike on new year's day: hope you enjoy the following clues.<br/>
This is the first box we've placed here in our home town, at one of our<br/>
favorite beaches. Hope you get a chance to enjoy, and please, give us a<br/>
call if you're around!<br/>
<br/>
We also placed a new box in Essex CT with clues to follow.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, we spent some time adding to the Seven Falls and Bear Hill<br/>
hikes, which you can link to from the LBNA site by clicking on<br/>
Connecticut. These are/were back-to-back series on the same trail just<br/>
west of the CT River, and had each been doubles. But they were kind of<br/>
strenous and we had been thinking of turning them in to triples to make<br/>
them more worthwhile. The new box on the Bear Hill hike is particularly<br/>
nicely placed, on a huge (by CT standards) ridge called "The Great Wall<br/>
of China."<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year! Jay and family.<br/>
