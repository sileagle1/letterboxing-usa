<div>The Lake Anna Womyn are at it again!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Placed: 1/21/03</div>
<div>County: Spotsylvania</div>
<div>Place: Lake Anna State Park</div>
<div>Difficulty: easy to moderate</div>
<div>Distance:  .8 miles beginning to end</div>
<div>Placed by:  Happy and Joy (AKA Corki and Blanche) of the Lake Anna 
Womyn</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Directions to Lake Anna State Park, Spotsylvania, Virginia - I-95 to exit 
118 (Thornburg) head west.  You will be on Rt. 606 which will turn into Rt. 
208 (Courthouse Rd.) at the Snell stoplight.  Pay careful attention to the 
Rt. 208 signs - there is a left hand turn that you must make or you will end up 
in the middle of nowhere.  Follow the signs to the State Park.  At Rt. 
601 (Lawyers Rd.) turn right.  The State Park will be on your right.  
Make sure you stop to get the map of the park or you will never get the 
clues.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To start off, follow the northern neck of the orange trail.  Cross 
over the road - be careful, it can be deceiving!  Follow to the open area - 
you will see the concession stands and the bathrooms.  Walk along to the 
right following the tree line down to the lake.  Pick up the elfin trail 
once you cross the troll's hiding place.  Follow the trail along the 
lake.  Look for the blue coconut hanging in a tree to your right.  No 
guarantees that it will stay there long - someone will more than likely spot it 
and carry it somewhere else.  Continue until you see a yellow State Park 
Boundary Marker on a tree to your right.  Do an about face.  If it 
were twilight time you would probably see a gorgeous sunset.  Take the left 
turn at 270 degrees.  Follow this to the wooden bridge.   While 
facing the bridge do another about face.  Look for the mountain laurel on 
the right.  Right up from there, look for the box at the base of the 
tri tree - will be on your right.</div></body></html>
