  The Gal Pals planted the first letterbox on St. John in the Virgin <br/>
Islands in August of 03. There was no option on LBNA site for the <br/>
Virgin Islands so we placed it under International however,it has not <br/>
shown up there yet. It is at our web site under the following:<br/>

&gt; Islands in August of 03. There was no option on LBNA site for the <br/>

<br/>
The Virgin Islands (and Caribbean in general) boxes are covered by <br/>
the Lesser Antilles (LSA) geographical area on the LBNA site.  <br/>
Unfortunately this area does not appear in the drop down list in <br/>
the "Search for boxes" page of the LBNA site. So these box clues <br/>
cannot be retrieved by location from that page.<br/>
<br/>
You're also out of luck if you go to the Clues page, select Central <br/>
America/Carribean/Bermuda and the select Lesser Antilles; none of the <br/>
Lesser Antilles boxes show up (actually none of the links under the <br/>
this page return any data).  I've reported this problem twice to the <br/>
webmasters but never got any response.  I have yet to find a way to <br/>
retrieve the  clues for boxes planted in the Lesser Antilles by <br/>
location.  If you happen to know the name of the box or placer you <br/>
can call up the clues from the "Search for boxes" page.  The Count <br/>
page does show 4 clues listings under Lesser Antilles...<br/>
<br/>
We also placed a box in St. John, The Damsel Fish Letterbox,  <br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?<br/>
boxnum=4034&amp;boxname=Damsel_Fish<br/>
<br/>
We placed this in April of 2003, but even this box wasn't the first <br/>
by a couple of years; we found the Cinnamon Bay Treasure letterbox <br/>
while we were there.  So far as I know this was the first box planted <br/>
on St. John; it was planted in Feb. of 2001 by Churchill and <br/>
Pinecone.  Its clues can be found by going to the old LBNA site and <br/>
looking under the Lesser Antilles section.<br/>
<br/>
I just recalled that there was another box planted on St. John around <br/>
the time that we planted ours and I was able to locate its clues by <br/>
searching for "LSA" in the letterbox-announce Yahoo group's messages <br/>
page.  This produced announcements for a few boxes in the Lesser <br/>
Antilles, but none in the Cayman Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the URL for the Uncle Sam LB placed by Baby Bear on St. John <br/>
in May of 2003.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=4153&amp;boxname=Uncle_Sam<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to finding the Annaberg School Ruins LB next time <br/>
we're there!  St. John is one of our favorite escapes especially in <br/>
the winter.<br/>
