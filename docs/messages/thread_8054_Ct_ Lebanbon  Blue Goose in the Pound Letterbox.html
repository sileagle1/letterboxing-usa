                      Fair , Now in a permanent home in Lebanon<br/>
Planted by: Leader of the Pack &amp; Pink Trotters<br/>

Rated: Drive up -  Historic Site<br/>

   The church bell at Lebanon Green  tolled and the Sunday service <br/>
came to a close. Families of parishoners filed out into the clear <br/>
autumn air. In a moment all was chaos! A large and  very indignant <br/>
goose began an assault on all who exited the church. Women shouted <br/>
boys chased and were chased back in return, young girls squealed and <br/>
the men said " It's only a goose just walk by!"  Moments later the <br/>
group of men who were conversing on the steps and watching the <br/>
incident broke up to head home for dinner. Then the fun began. More <br/>
targets for the wayward goose and he lowered his head ,set his sights <br/>
on a well dressed gentleman hissed a warning a pecked him on the <br/>
backside.  One less gentleman to sit down for dinner on that <br/>
particular Sunday.  He raised his voice and went after the goose <br/>
shagging it from the lawn of the church out into the busy street and <br/>
headed it off west down Rte 207.  The families walking home from <br/>
church that way were next accosted by the ornery goose , a great <br/>
ruckus ensued.  Soon several men  gathered their forces to drive the <br/>
goose down the road to pen it in the Town Pound. With sticks and <br/>
brooms in their defense arsenal the  goose meandered down  207 <br/>
stopping to peck at an insect or green grass occasionaly. He would <br/>
hiss threats if the men got to close or demanded any form of respect <br/>
from the goose. Soon a young boy cut a wide path around the goose and <br/>
opened the gate to the pound. A large hog, 2 sheep and  a small <br/>
female goose were penned already. Wayward from their homes and <br/>
causing grievance to the community remanded them to the pound until a <br/>
suitable fine was payed and they would then be released to the farmer <br/>
who owned them.  Upon entering the pound the Goose who was really <br/>
just a lonesome gander spied the pretty female  a immediatley set his <br/>
intentions upon her. With a favorable interest they set to making a <br/>
nest in this pound and peace prevailed in the Community once more. <br/>
If you stand in the center of the pound facing the road and school <br/>
take a reading of 280 degrees to where the geese had their nest upon <br/>
the ground in the corner by the tree. Here now on the ground a white <br/>
stone and several protective rocks mark the domain of the Blue Goose <br/>
of Sunday fame. <br/>
   Do not disturb the historic town pound walls!!! Do bring a picnic <br/>
if the day is right and enjoy antoher historic landmark in Lebanon<br/>
