thankfully. We went to the city to do some back to school shopping, <br/>
then detoured on the way home to look for a letterbox on Goose <br/>
Island. We weren't successful, but do plan to try again before too <br/>
long. We had had a full day of shopping and were really worn out.<br/>
<br/>
 I had forgotten my long and sturdy 'snake poking stick', and it was <br/>
pretty thick and grown up back there. The mosquitoes were fierce <br/>
too, so after looking behind several trees, the best we could (bent <br/>
down under the overgrowth) we gave up. The fallen leaves and <br/>
branches were really thick too - most likely from Hurricane <br/>
Claudette. <br/>
<br/>
On our way out, a garter snake slithered by right in front of us. <br/>
LOL! I wished I had some appropriate letterboxes with me yesterday, <br/>
since I saw several places all around the coastal area that looked <br/>
like promising places to hide letterboxes. Next time I will be <br/>
better prepared, and not already exhausted from a really tiring day. <br/>

Today, she (7 yrs. old) decided on a design for her signature stamp -<br/>
 a snake in the shape of an 'S', her initial. Not exactly what I <br/>
would have thought she would want, but... oh, well! I suppose I <br/>
should be grateful I don't have to try carving a Barbie doll or a <br/>
cheerleader. LOL!<br/>
