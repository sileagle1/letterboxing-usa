<div>The simple pleasures in life are free...... Fun 
things often cost just pennies..... 25 cents for a  balloon that can be 
blown up and squeaked for miles on the journey to a letterbox!  Well we 
found a simple pleasure in a great rock that a boy just had to climb on to 
conquer. If you have the need to climb a rock and declare yourself victor head 
to New York's beautiful Colgate University at Hamilton.  Begin at 1819 you 
can't miss it. Take the shady lane to the top of the hill. We were right with 
the Alumni and followed the Alumni to  Chapel Rd. Along Chapel road we 
spied the big rock. ( If you drive past there are 2 parking spots just a bit 
further along ) .</div>
<div>Stand looking at the rock Or stand on the rock 
if it suits you. With your back to the road look left to the stone wall along to 
where it curves. Look For a small round rock perched there near a tree whose 
bark is gone. There tucked in the wall is your prize but be sure no one sees you 
take it out, then stamp in and rehide it so it can't be seen. Keep the secret of 
letterboxing.  Gather your pennies and count your blessings the best things 
in life are free.  Planted by Leader of the Pack and the Cowboy July 3,
