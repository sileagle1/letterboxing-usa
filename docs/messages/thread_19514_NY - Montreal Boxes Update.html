1 - Finch Hollow<br/>
2-6 - Alafair's Unpublished 5<br/>
7 - I Love New York HH Hostel (took Snoopy, left another)<br/>
8 - Snoopy Come Home HH<br/>
9 - Inukshuk - (Woo hoo) I told a friend about this one, and he <br/>
actually went up yesterday hoping to pull a trick on me, since we <br/>
were planning to go up together this morning. He's never boxed <br/>
before, and couldn't find it. Hee hee. Joke's on him.  I pulled it <br/>
right out this morning, fine and dirty. (First Finders - I think, <br/>
left a little something for the 2nd finders.)<br/>
<br/>
So far so good, found all that I stopped to look for. (Took some <br/>
wrong turns on one and ended up having more exercise and bug bites <br/>
than were absolutely necessary.)<br/>
<br/>
Inukshuk was my first out of country boxing experience.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Montreal Thursday to go back and hit some NY boxes.<br/>
<br/>
BOX ON!<br/>
