                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was a cashier at Burger King when I was in high school....but longed <br/>
to work at the male dominated position of "grill man".  Not because it <br/>
looked more glamorous (lol)  than waiting on the public, but because <br/>
the owner said girls couldn't. I have been a feminist for as long as I <br/>
could remember and had successfully lobbied the Utica Observer-Dispatch <br/>
to allow me to be a "paperboy" when I was 12. It was such a big deal <br/>
that I made the front page! But that job was more about me hating <br/>
babysitting and having so few jobs available to kids my age.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow...I was thrilled and a bit smug when I was grudingly allowed to <br/>
try my hand at "grillman." OH MY GOD. They had microphones that would <br/>
transmit the orders over speakers into the grill area. No monitors with <br/>
printed orders. No screens or paper slips or ANYTHING visual. Just <br/>
rapid fire orders, complete with special requests (no pickles, extra <br/>
mayo, no salt on fries..etc). And all this from 5 registers plus a <br/>
drive thru. You would have to listen to all these orders and make the <br/>
food exactl as ordered..and ignore the parts that DIDN'T apply to <br/>
you...like beverages. Just think of trying to work at your job while 6 <br/>
people shouted requests at you simutaneously!!!   Ah well, it was great <br/>
training for becoming a wife and mother. :)<br/>
<br/>
Butthe worst part was the heat. Even in the summer, I had to wear a <br/>
high collared polyester uniform with polyester hat (who designs this <br/>
stuff?!?) I worked behind a double grill with a bun steamer to the left <br/>
of me, a bun toaster behind me, and deep fat fryers to the right of <br/>
me.  By the end of my shift I was absolutely wilted.<br/>
