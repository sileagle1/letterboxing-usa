Tiger please check the clues just before coming down I think I may <br/>

doesn't work, but I don't see how it has anything to do with our <br/>
calling counties parishes! Evangeline Parish could just as well be <br/>
called Evangeline County - makes no matter to me.  I'd just like the <br/>
darn thing to work right.<br/>
<br/>
How does the fact that we call counties parishes affect the coding <br/>
for the website???<br/>

I think someone mentioned it back when the current format was <br/>
started. It seems to me that if the 'search for' link works the map <br/>
should to.  Although the home page says something about a redesign <br/>
contest ending June 1st.  Hopefully it will include a reformatting <br/>
as well.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow thanks.  I had found a few listed on the placer sites, and worked hard <br/>
to determine nearby address, and convert those to<br/>
Longitude &amp; Latitude and put into my GPS (also do Geocaching).  So now I <br/>
have a few more to put into my system<br/>
I copy and paste the clues sheets into a program I use on my PocketPC, so <br/>
no deed to carry a bunch of print out anymore.<br/>
Getting a little hi-tech, but its fun for me.    I'm  a teacher, so have <br/>
plenty of free time during the summer.<br/>
