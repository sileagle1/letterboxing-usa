but we have had two beautiful afternoons of weather the last couple of days!<br/>
<br/>
When I left school today in Enfield, it started to sputter.  I thought as I <br/>
drove down I-91, that I wouldn't get out boxing today.  Well.... I got to the <br/>
eastern end of I-291 and the skies started to get brighter!  Once I changed my <br/>
clothes at home, and started driving out to Mansfield, the sun was out and the <br/>
sky was BLUE!!!!  Woo Hoo!!!<br/>
<br/>
So.... I was able to get the following boxes: The Bed Rug, The Rock Climber, <br/>
Vermont State Stamp, Inherit the Earth, The Good Earth, Tiger Cub, Pine for <br/>
You, Dunham Woods, and the new Gaelic box by Irishtinker.  <br/>
<br/>
I could NOT find the Sit and Relax box at Eagleville Preserve.  Anyone else <br/>
find it lately?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I left a special surprise at a box today!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all at the gather tomorrow!  I'm going out boxing.... can't <br/>
wait for the rain forever!!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
