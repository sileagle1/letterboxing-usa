and/or Rustypuff this summer.<br/>
<br/>
20020525 (Rustypuff)<br/>
Washington's Walkabout LB  aka "Premier President"<br/>
Glocester, RI<br/>
<br/>
20020525 (CSCM &amp; Rustypuff)<br/>
Hour of the Olympics LB series<br/>
Glocester, RI<br/>
<br/>
20020604 (CSCM &amp; Rustypuff)<br/>
Cardinals Rule LB<br/>
York State Park, VA<br/>
As noted by Tig in the logbook, we too we're pleased to find a box <br/>
that had not yet been ferreted out by the ubiquitous Wanda &amp; Pete!<br/>
<br/>
20020705 (CSCM &amp; Rustypuff)<br/>
Wizard of Oz LB series: Dorothy &amp; Toto, Duality of Nature<br/>
Carolina Management Area, Richmond, RI<br/>
Because we were walking with a very hot black dog, we turned back <br/>
after the first two boxes, but we'll be back!<br/>
<br/>
20020721 <br/>
Exchanged stamps with Warrior Woman and Safari Leader (CSCM &amp; <br/>
Rustypuff) and Mary and Betz (Rustypuff only) at an alt.rhode_island <br/>
confab in Little Compton, RI<br/>
<br/>
20020727 (CSCM &amp; Rustypuff)<br/>
Tri-State Hike LB series<br/>
Buck Hill Management Area, Burrillville, RI<br/>
All boxes intact and dry.<br/>
<br/>
20020807 (Rustypuff)<br/>
The Proposal LB Series<br/>
Purgatory Chasm State Park, Sutton, MA<br/>
All boxes found.<br/>
<br/>
20020810 (CSCM &amp; Rustypuff)<br/>
The Phantom LB<br/>
Blue Hills Reservation, Quincy, MA<br/>
Careful for the poison ivy CSCM caught it again even though<br/>
I told <br/>
him he was sitting in it.<br/>
<br/>
20020813<br/>
Rustypuff carved a stamp for her summer camp kids (the Moose Hill <br/>
Trekkers) called the "Humongous Fungus Among Us."  It was<br/>
placed as a <br/>
hitchhiker at Franconia Notch in NH.  Good hunting!<br/>
<br/>
20020815<br/>
Rustypuff exchanged stamps with new letterboxers! Max D.<br/>
("M") and <br/>
Ben M. (Dino-Mite) Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
20020817 (CSCM &amp; Rustypuff)<br/>
Beavertail Light LB, Fort Getty LB<br/>
Jamestown, RI.<br/>
The Fort Getty container, one of those disposable Glad jobs, was in <br/>
very rough shape, but the contents were still intact and dry within <br/>
their plastic bags. <br/>
<br/>
20020824 (CSCM &amp; Rustypuff)<br/>
Bay of Bristol LB series and<br/>
East Bay Bike LB series I: The Jogger<br/>
Colt State Park, Bristol, RI<br/>
These three boxes were all intact and in place.  The bees' nest in <br/>
the multi-trunked oak tree near the first Bay of Bristol box can be <br/>
avoided by bushwacking around it.  We only had time to look for the <br/>
first in the East Bay Bike Path series.<br/>
<br/>
20020825 (CSCM &amp; Rustypuff)<br/>
Borderland Faeries LB series: Joy<br/>
Borderland State Park, Sharon, MA<br/>
Joy was intact and dry and disturbingly easy to find once we got over <br/>
thinking that the "jumbled rocks" had to be directly opposite the <br/>
quarry sign.  We rehid it in the same jumble in which we found it, <br/>
but out of direct view of the trail.<br/>
We had heard reports that Serenity was missing, so we checked on our <br/>
way back from Joy, and indeed, Serenity is not where we had found it <br/>
a year ago, so it would seem to be gone.<br/>
<br/>
During the summer we also came across two hitchhikers -- Beaver Crew <br/>
and Two Shore Birds.  Beaver Crew was found at the Moose Hill Bluffs <br/>
letterbox at the Moose Hill Wildlife Sanctuary in Sharon, MA, and it <br/>
is now somewhere else.  Two Shore Birds was in transit, in the hands <br/>
of another 'boxer.<br/>
<br/>
We placed a box during our trip to Wyoming (now there are 3 in the <br/>
state!!) called the Thatched Mystery.  Look for clues to be posted <br/>
soon if you are heading near any big natural attractions out there.<br/>
<br/>
We've also begun to hide boxes for a five-box series called Rhode <br/>
Island Compass.  Clues will be posted when all boxes are hidden.<br/>
