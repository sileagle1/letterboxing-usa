Paint Creek State Park, near Bainbridge, Ohio. Difficulty: Easy.    <br/>
Start at the large parking area below the spillway. CLUES: At one <br/>
end of the parking area, there is a large sign reading "WARNING-<br/>
BLAST OF HORN...etc.". Take the trail past this sign. At 46 paces <br/>
down the trail, you should see a large boulder to the right of the <br/>
trail. The box is hidden at the base of the northwest side of the <br/>
boulder, under two smaller rocks. Note: this is the second version <br/>
of this box--the first was in a completely different location which <br/>
became unsuitable due to recent new landscaping.<br/>
