                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've been at this (actively) little more than a month.  Our very first find was a letterbox with a HH.  We were very excited.  We contacted the placer and heard right back from them.  This also was exciting for us, being new and all.  So far, we've found 14 and placed 8, 3 of which are HH.  I don't think we would have even tried HH's if we hadn't found one and gotten the positive response that we got.  I hope we are able to keep track of their travels but it sounds like we might not.  <br/>
<br/>
Keep your eyes open for Lucky 5 HH, already discovered and on its way to a new box.  Also, Lord of the Ring HH is lurking somewhere in NH as well as the Irish Rover HH.  <br/>
<br/>
We are loving this new hobby.  The kids like it too.  Our two year old keeps saying "Letterboxing, mommy, letterboxing".  It is a hit with everyone.  We just wish there weren't so many mosquitoes.  I may buy insect repellent by the case this year!  <br/>
<br/>
Hope to run into some of you on the trails.<br/>
