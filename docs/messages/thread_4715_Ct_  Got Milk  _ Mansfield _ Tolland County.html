   In Mansfield come to Stearns Rd off of Rte 32 near the junction of <br/>
Rte 31 and Mansfield Drive -in Theatre ( just north of there) . <br/>
Follow Stearns  Rd. through a residential area and then woods and <br/>
drive up the hill. You come into the clearing of farmland and <br/>
buildings in the distance. Soon You come to the main barn of Mountain <br/>
Dairy perched on the edge of the road and the small gravel parking <br/>
lot for workers across the street. Turn around here and head back the <br/>
way you came. There is a telephone pole in the gravel parking lot <br/>
count three more after that one and pull off the road on the left <br/>
side to enjoy the fantastic view.( Binoculars would be great)  There <br/>
is a barway ( space in a stonewall ) with a metal pipe and wire gate <br/>
and weeds all about. A large rock on the right side and several small <br/>
rocks on the left. The top three small rocks( left) hide your <br/>
letterbox. The first two pages of the journal will help you identify <br/>
the sights you can see from this vantage point. PLEASE don't <br/>
interrupt the farm family or workers as their day is long enough <br/>
already. There are around 400 cows to be milked twice a day and many <br/>
young stock to be fed. Then all the crop work of the season. You may <br/>
see Manure spreading -returning nutrients to the soil before <br/>
planting , or corn planting , hay harvest, and in the fall corn <br/>
harvest. The day here begins at 3 a.m. and ends about 6-7 p.m. The 11 <br/>
generations of Stearns family members have lived and worked these <br/>
fields since 1772 and so get the honor of being my first box in the <br/>
Timeline series. Our milk is available at the Mansfield Centre <br/>
General Store we have no on farm sales.  Rehide the box under the <br/>
three stones so it can't be seen. Do try to be discreet about your <br/>
activity.  Have Fun and Be Safe  from Leader of the Pack- 9th <br/>
generation<br/>
