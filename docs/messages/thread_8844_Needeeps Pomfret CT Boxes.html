<div><span class="780101801-03112002">Today Chickabirdie, 
Molly and myself visited 7 of the 10 boxes planted by Needeeps in Pomfret. We 
were very impressed with all 7 of the boxes we visited. Molly loved the fields 
and streams. Chickabirdie liked the Duck Blind box the best. It was the last box 
we did for the day. All the geese flying overhead and the purple clouds 
overhead, it did look beautiful. Earlier at the Mashamoquet Meadow Trail, 
we got to meet and do an exchange with "The Bird Stamper". We were his first 
exchange. Very nice area for letterboxes. All the boxes were made up very well. 
For those that prefer the hand made stamps, I don't think it possible to not 
like these beautiful store bought stamps. Great stamps equal to or better 
than many of the 270 stamps I found in boxes. Everything was done very 
nicely. We had a very nice day. Thank you Needeeps for the boxes you planted. 
Well done. Very well done. .....Chuck and 
Molly</span></div></body></html>
