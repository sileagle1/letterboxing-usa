                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I recently returned from a trip to Aruba, in the Caribbean, where<br/>
I placed a letterbox!  It's not quite North America, but I couldn't <br/>
resist.  Here are the pertinent details.<br/>
<br/>
 my name:      Rebecca Spainhower<br/>
 its name:     Aruba Letterbox  (it's the first so far!)<br/>
 date placed:  2 November 2001<br/>
 location:     Casibari Rock Formation, somewhat near Ayo, Aruba<br/>
<br/>
Here is the clue:<br/>
<br/>
 Cars surround the entrance, of every shape and size.<br/>
<br/>
 Approach the little green house, and keep it a la izquierda.<br/>
<br/>
 Sit on the benches if you want, but keep going on the path<br/>
  if you want the stamp!<br/>
<br/>
 Ignore the roads less traveled to the right and left.<br/>
<br/>
 Before the bend, look well left for the empty well circle, and the<br/>
  twin boulders colliding, with a triangle in between.<br/>
<br/>
 A little platform perches under the shelter of the heavy boulders.<br/>
  There shouldn't be much risk of collapse, if you stand there<br/>
  carefully!<br/>
<br/>
 Review the terrain and watch out for the cactus to the right!<br/>
<br/>
 In the cracked crevice lies the prize, brought from so many miles!<br/>
<br/>

files.  I could not find it.  This is of interest to me, as I will be <br/>
leaving tomorrow for a cruise.  I hope to leave letterboxes on <br/>
Jamaica and Grand Cayman.  First (listed) in a country! Yea!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows of any British listing of letterboxes on Grand <br/>
Cayman, please let me know early this evening.<br/>
