have visited in the last week or so!<br/>
<br/>
Due to a wacky schedule for April vacation, I had few days off these last two <br/>
weeks, unlike OTHER teachers who actually have a full week off.... sigh....  <br/>
Anyway, a week ago Monday, I traveled over the river and through the woods to <br/>
grandmother's house to introduce her to my most recent hobby.  (actually, I <br/>
didn't go over the river, she lives in Glastonbury!)  We walked from her <br/>
house to Sunshine Daydream at the Audoban Society in Glastonbury.  We found <br/>
both boxes alive and well, however, the Daydream box's stamp pad was quite <br/>
wet.  I was quite amazed that Grandma could do the hike, AND still be able to <br/>
get up the long hill to her house!  Kudos to Grandma!  You go girl!!!!  <br/>
Anyway, on TUesday, I went out boxing after school to find the Soccer <br/>
Challenge Box (Which was previously missing, but has been replaced... THANK <br/>
YOU!!!) and Sweet William, which are both in Bristol.  On Wednesday, I found <br/>
Hope in Wallingford at the Labryinth, which is a beautiful stamp!  Butterfly, <br/>
you did a great job!  Also on Wednesday, I peeked into the Stamp Studio to <br/>
find Bob of Voyageur and Pixie Pam taking a carving class!<br/>
<br/>
While down at the Mashantucket Pequot Research Library, I decided to find the <br/>
Code 1 box on the way home.  Great pond and spot!  A shady character came out <br/>
of the woods with a twelve pack of coke and other stuff, but who knows?  <br/>
Perhaps there's a convenience store on the other side of the woods?????  <br/>
While aimlessly driving through SE CT, I also looked in on the "A Fruity <br/>
Mystery" box, to find that VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THERE!!!!  Folks.... <br/>
this is the easiest mystery on Earth!!!! (outside of my Mary Cheney mystery <br/>
box of course!)  two words:  google search!  Also in my aimless drives, I <br/>
found a really cool Saw Mill!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
My family had Easter dinner in RI, so I ventured out to some RI sights with <br/>
Butterfly and Moonstone Baby on Monday!  We found nine out of ten of the <br/>
Ornament series:  all were in fine shape, however, we were unable to find <br/>
Pickle.  From what I saw in the Kindergarten Keepsakes box, we weren't the <br/>
only ones that Pickle eluded!  BTW.... the Kindergarten Keepsakes box was my <br/>
500th box!!!! Woo Hoo!!!  We also found Camping at Burlingame, Crossways <br/>
Crossed Path LB 1 and 2, along with the Star Peach HH.  We were unable to <br/>
find the sanctuary which holds Dingoes at Dinnertime, however Moonstone Baby <br/>
and I AREN"T GIVING UP!  We decided to drop the search for the day since <br/>
Butterfly hadn't gotten a box in a couple of hours and was going through <br/>
withdrawals!  After that, we went to find Box 2 of the Frenchtown Park <br/>
series, THe North South Trail "The Pines", Rhode Island and Providence <br/>
Plantations, Traveling Valentine HH, Strix Varia, Lil' Butterfly, and North <br/>
Camp.  All in all, a great day!  Thanks to Butterfly and Moonstone Baby!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Tuesday proved to be a fruitful day, even with the occasional <br/>
downpours that we had dumped on us!  Butterfly, Bluebird and I sent out to <br/>
find Sadie and Russ' new series, Above It All.  GREAT SERIES!!!!!!  Need I <br/>
say more?  We also found the Alchemist's box: Mercury.  THen off to Sleeping <br/>
Giant (yes in the rain!!!) to find four of Butterfly's new series, Ned's <br/>
Cabin, Right Leg and Gorge Cascade of Jay Drew's, Jolly Mean Giant, and <br/>
Cascade LB of Lobsta Lady.  All were in fine shape!  I especially loved the <br/>
Jolly Mean Giant!  Great Stamp and very inventive clues!  Butterfly and <br/>
Bluebird made me do all of the work of counting X and U's!<br/>
<br/>
All in all, a great week!  Tomorrow, back to work....ugh!  Why can't I have a <br/>
spring break too??????<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>

<br/>
Congrats on 500!!!  Happy to hear it was on Kindergarten Keepsakes. <br/>
I think that box I sent to RI has seen more visitors since January <br/>
than all my Michigan boxes combined! (believe me, it wouldn't take<br/>
much)<br/>

That's sooooo cool that you got Grandma to go with you.<br/>
I wish my mom would do a box or two (oops, I forgot, she's<br/>
having her knee replaced today, so it may be awhile)<br/>
Sounds like you had a great weekend, Congratulations<br/>
on your 500th box. Way to go!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ohh! So sorry to hear that some folks are having trouble finding <br/>
the "Pickle" in our "Favorite Ornaments Series"! Just like the pickle <br/>
specially hidden for the children on the traditional German Christmas <br/>
tree, it IS meant to be the hardest one to find, but not THAT hard!!! <br/>
It would have been kind of cool if that had been Pam's 500th, but <br/>
since she didn't find it, I'm glad she got it to be "Kindergarten <br/>
Keepsakes" -  better that than the "Cuckoo Clock"! (But-hey-I should <br/>
talk! My 500th had to be the "Red Spotted Newt"!!!)<br/>
