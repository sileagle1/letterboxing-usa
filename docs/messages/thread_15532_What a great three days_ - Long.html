Here's where we went and what we found:<br/>
<br/>
8-31-03<br/>
It was a dark and stormy... Oh wait, that's another story :-) It was a rainy afternoon, and Wanda &amp; I didn't get in place to start looking for boxes till after 12:00, but we still managed to find tons of boxes in John Bryon Park. What a beautiful place. I forgot to bring my camera (as recommended) and kept saying "Ohhh, I wish I had my camera! That's beautiful!" If you visit this park DON'T forget your camera, the scenery is breathtaking! Also bring several micro box log sheets as several of the boxes had full and/or wet logs.<br/>
<br/>
We started our quest of frogs with the Proto Cave Frog series. The rock that #1 is under is no longer white, it's moss covered :-) We found a live skink residing with this frog too! (Didn't stamp him though :-)<br/>
Frog #2 was not in the obvious tree, but found alive and well<br/>
Frog #3 we couldn't find. There was no sign of a brick anywhere or the frog. <br/>
<br/>
Next, we looked for the Tree Frog family.<br/>
At #1, there wasn't a larger rock or a fist size rock, but we didn't see any other tree that we would 'run into' that was growing out of a rock. There was a small hollow at the base of the tree, but no frog.<br/>
Frog #2 was found, but the log was wet and some of the sig stamps were washed out. Down to the last page of the log.<br/>
Frog #3 was safe and sound, but the log was completely full. I added another page, but it needs a new log.<br/>
<br/>
Then we looked for Vines of Time and Resting Spot. Both were found in the cool ruins of that structure. Resting Spot's container was open and needs more log sheets. I put the whole microbox into a baggie before Wanda put it back.<br/>
<br/>
It was on the some cliff climbing! We searched for the Cave Frog family (glad I didn't bring a dog on this trip). <br/>
We were not able to find #1 either on the way out, or on the way back (6 paces from #2). We looked under all the movable rocks at that cave, but no frog stamp, just a few live frogs! The damp weather had them out all over the park. If I had an "L" count, it would have seriously increased this trip!<br/>
Frog #2 was alive and well<br/>
Frog #3's home was crushed and full of water, so the log was soaked. We dried it out as best as we could (in the rain, so not much) and put the whole container in a baggie. <br/>
<br/>
After we climbed out of the gorge, it was on to Rediscovery Frogs-<br/>
#1 was easy to find in a very cool spot! I loved the bridge and with all the rain, the river was really running high.<br/>
#2 thought he could out smart us with the wrong set of rocks, but we found him snug in his home, this frog had lots of visitors of the arachnid kind - yuck! Wanda volunteered to climb in for the retrieve. She takes on the spiders, I take on the poison ivy :-)<br/>
#3 was listed as MIA on the clue sheet, so I planted a letterbox instead! Look for clues soon on Lbna <br/>
<br/>
Next we tackled the Genesis Frogs Series-<br/>
We got #1 under our umbrellas to keep it all dry in the downpour as we stamped in<br/>
#2 was found, but the log had gotten wet so some of the sig stamps are a blur. Log book is FULL!<br/>
#3 Found! This makes our first full series of Frogs found. This log book was also full.<br/>
<br/>
The Proto Tree frogs were next:<br/>
Frog #1 had a disintegrating cocoon. It's impossible to get the container out without removing the cocoon from the tree. If it had a string like the other one, it's gone.<br/>
Frog #2 had a full and wet log book, but it was a very nice place to stamp in (under an umbrella of course).<br/>
Frog #3 Another complete series! Whoo Hoo! This one had a missing lid and the bank was really slippery due to all the rain and wet ground.<br/>
<br/>
Then we went on the Road to Rivendale. After a rough start with where the trail started (degrees are correct).<br/>
Frog #1 has a wet log and only 2 other people have stamped in since 2002! The timing for this one was right on.<br/>
Frog #2 wasn't so lucky. Again, the timing was just right and we found the tree, but there was a hole under the rock instead of a box. I think that a critter may have tunneled up from under the rock and that the box fell into the deep hole. <br/>
Frog #3 gave us trouble too. We found the post, but could not locate the proper tree or any sign of the box's hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
It was getting dark rapidly at this point, thanks to the heavy cloud cover, but we went on a mission to find Horace Mann. We were trying to use the park's map instead of concentrating on the clue sheet and the park's poor map had us almost pulling our hair out! We finally drove down the road mentioned in the clues and saw the pillar in the field! Then we went back and parked and walked up to the spot where the Statue stood in all it's red footed glory. Very strange! Log was completely filled. We stamped into the page Bigguy left at his visit.<br/>
<br/>
Still a bit of daylight left, so we went in search of the John Bryon stamp. The box was out in the open behind the tree and full of water. I dried it out with a paper towel, re bagged all of the contents and replaced it with the rock back on top. Hopefully it will remain in place and dry<br/>
<br/>
Back in the car, ready to head home, we realize there is " just one more stamp " very near by. In the dark, we found the Covered bridge! It's easy not to notice the graffiti IN THE DARK! :-) I can't believe we located this one given the conditions. Wanda even stamped her sig stamp with the wrong color ink because she couldn't tell what color was which! Of course using a flash light would have been cheating :-) This log book was full, but dry. <br/>
<br/>
What a great day! <br/>
<br/>

Day 2 (I told you this report was long!)<br/>
****************************************************<br/>
We got an early start to meet Franzsolo at 9:00 am, but we got sidetracked getting breakfast at the store, so we were late. Wanda, Franzsolo, Coyote and I all got in my van and started toward the Chillicothe area when the skies opened up and poured down more rain!  **free info to follow: Indianapolis got 7 inches of rain today, more than any other day since they started recording rain fall! and it's only about 2 hours West of where we were! Luckily, as we approached Jackson, the rain let up and the skies cleared. We had a great day till the very end when the dark, ominous clouds rolled in.<br/>
<br/>
Our day started at Flyfisher. Unfortunately, the stamp was missing, but the box was still there...go figure! We added a new stamp for the next visitor.<br/>
On to Jackson and the Jackson County Pride - found alive and well.<br/>
