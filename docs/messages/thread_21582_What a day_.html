<br/>
So here in Massachusetts, it was a bright, sunny day, 50 <br/>
degrees...great day for those of us itching to go letterboxing to <br/>
get out there and do some. <br/>
<br/>
We mapped out our route, chosing "easy" boxes that were most likely <br/>
not going to be buried under a foot of snow. We chose to do some of <br/>
the Zodiac boxes placed around western MA, all which are in <br/>
cemeteries. <br/>
<br/>
We get to destination #1, see that the road is pretty mucky, we <br/>
proceed in further, suddenly the previous tire tracks stop &amp; so do <br/>
we. Stuck in about 3" of snow &amp; ice. We call AAA, wait 45 minutes <br/>
for a truck to show up. He heads in &amp; decides he's better off to <br/>
back in to get us out. He gets stuck for about 5 minutes, gets <br/>
himself out &amp; takes off. We argue with AAA on the phone &amp; get put on <br/>
hold off &amp; on for about 15 minutes, then they tell us that to have <br/>
the truck (same guy) come back will be $150. They said it was so <br/>
expensive because the road in the cemetery is unmaintained. The guy <br/>
comes back another 45 minutes later,coming in a different way &amp; with <br/>
a smaller truck,  cursing up a storm because the chain is so tough <br/>
to attach to the car.  Another 30 minutes or so &amp; we are finally out <br/>
of the cemetery. <br/>
<br/>
So $150, 3 hours &amp; some soaking wet feet we managed to get 1 whole <br/>
box! Man this snow better disappear quick I do not ever want a <br/>
repeat of today!<br/>
