                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey all--decided I needed a vacation from the<br/>
craziness that otherwise passes as my life.  So, off<br/>
to my best friend's house and letterboxing heaven!<br/>
<br/>
Tig and I have had a blast finding some pretty cool<br/>
letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Found the Great Swamp Mounument box in good condition<br/>
with a very cool stamp and harboring a<br/>
hitchhiker--Traveler with a Twist.  This was Tig's<br/>
first hitchhiker and only my second, so this was a<br/>
great find for our first box of the trip. Twist rode<br/>
with us a bit before deciding to leave the pack. <br/>
<br/>
It was on to URI to find RIBNAG's two remaining boxes<br/>
in the Fast Track to your Degree series.  Way too much<br/>
fun on a beautiful campus.  Then we found Ghosttown at<br/>
Sundown after a hike up the tower.  It, too was in<br/>
good shape though it might need a new logbook soon!<br/>
:o)<br/>
Finally we climbed Pettaquamscutt Rock to pick up<br/>
Viking Ships at Sunrise--awesome stamp, Trish, thank<br/>
you!<br/>
<br/>
Today we were only able to find one of our many<br/>
searches--Secrets of the Knob in Woods Hole is an<br/>
absolute must.  The view from the Knob was so<br/>
beautiful and it's quite a nice stamp.  Thanks for<br/>
bringing us out to a place we would have never known<br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
Will post a second post about the ones that eluded us.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone (especially Tig) for a couple of<br/>
awesome days.<br/>
<br/>
Amy <br/>
