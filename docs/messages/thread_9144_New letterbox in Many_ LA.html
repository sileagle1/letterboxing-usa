The "Cypress Bend" letterbox can be found at the Cypress Bend Golf <br/>
Resort and Conference Center, on the Texas/Louisiana border, and <br/>
overlooking Toledo Bend Reservoir.  This beautiful retreat offers <br/>
beautiful views, spa facilities, and a challenging golf course.  For <br/>
more information, go to www.cypressbend.com.  From Many, LA, travel <br/>
12 miles west on highway 6 to highway 191.  Turn left (south) on <br/>
highway 191 and travel 3 miles to Cypress Bend Drive, turn right.  <br/>
Follow the signs to the resort, past the golf pro-shop (about 3 more <br/>
miles).   Park in the main parking area below the drop off circle at <br/>
the main entrance to the lobby.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Option 1:  If you decide to play a round of golf, then enjoy the <br/>
first 16 holes.   After teeing off on the 17th hole, cross the cart <br/>
path bridge toward the 17th green.  On the far end of the bridge, <br/>
climb down the right side (as you face the direction you were <br/>
driving) and look up, on top of the first crossbeam below the <br/>
bridge.  Good luck with your game.<br/>
<br/>
Option 2:  If hiking, enter the main lobby of the resort.  Continue <br/>
straight through the lobby, and exit the back doors onto the <br/>
terrace.  Walk across the grass in front of you to get on the golf <br/>
cart path in front of the 18th green of the golf course.  Be careful <br/>
as you hike this path for golfers in play (suggest you do this early <br/>
in the morning or at dusk).  Once on the path, go right for 45 paces <br/>
to a split in the golf path.  Follow the left path, which will take <br/>
you along the 18th hole fairway and tee box.  Continue past this tee <br/>
box on the cart path, and down the hill to the 17th hole green that <br/>
overlooks Toledo Bend Reservoir.  You should now see the bridge down <br/>
below to your left.  Once at the bridge, climb down the left side, <br/>
and look back up on top of the first crossbeam.   Again, be careful <br/>
of golfers.  Enjoy the view from the bridge, which is the best of the <br/>
golf course.<br/>
