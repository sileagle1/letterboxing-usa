Whether it's the BR rainbow sherbet that's giving me a sunny disposition (I <br/>
wasn't going to have any -- really -- but Miss Ma changed her mind regarding <br/>
the flavor after it was already scooped...) or just the time of the year to <br/>
be reflective....  Team BeMa would like to propose a special up and coming <br/>
letterbox.  This box, to be called Helping Hands would be a charity box.  <br/>
What we mean by that is, each month team BeMa would tally up the number of <br/>
new stamps in this box's logbook.  We would then donate $1 per stamp to a <br/>
predesignated charity.<br/>
<br/>
We're just having such a good time doing this and it basically costs us <br/>
nothing.  We thought it might be nice to make it a way of doing something <br/>
for others and maybe raising the awareness of some of the charities we <br/>
believe in.  Hopefully this would not be too political.<br/>
<br/>
  For example, January would be Martha's Table month and the $1 we donate <br/>
per stamp (this is BeMa money, not money anyone has to leave in the box or <br/>
anything) would go toward buying food for this soup kitchen.  February could <br/>
be the ASPCA of Northern VA where we adopted our dog, March local PBS <br/>
stations (MPT, WETA)(we already give way too much money to Nintendo...), <br/>
April Special Olympics, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We would list the websites of these organizations with the clues so anyone <br/>
who is interested can learn more about them.<br/>
<br/>
So, the charities would get money, some boxers could learn about some good <br/>
works being done and we could all have fun looking for the box.<br/>
<br/>
Thought it might be an interesting thing to try.  BeMa<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We were thinking of doing an environmental group as well.  As you said, it <br/>
fits in so well with what we are doing and what we are thankful for.  The <br/>
park in which we are thinking of placing this box has a small entrance fee.  <br/>
In that way, we felt that we were contributing to the park and local trails <br/>
every month.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestion.  The Nature Conservancy sounds like a great <br/>
organization!  It is amazing once you start looking (or get on a few mailing <br/>
lists!) how many worthy organizations are out there.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you as well for the extremely generous offer to match!  We will keep a <br/>
posting of when the box is placed (I carved it this afternoon and have <br/>
already wrecked it a little by not leaving it alone...) so we plan on <br/>
placing it the first few days of January.<br/>
<br/>
The kids are excited about the idea.  That also makes us happy. We would <br/>
like them to grow up thinking of others (human, animal and nature) and <br/>
knowing that they can contribute.  We like the idea of tying in an action <br/>
that children can do (finding and stamping the letterbox) with the donation. <br/>
  Let the children see that their actions can help!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the support!  BeMa<br/>

That's an interesting thought -  doing a different stamp to represent each <br/>
charity.<br/>
But, I'm not that good a carver!  Maybe next time I will practice my carving <br/>
skills and then flip the idea around and ask everyone to earmark a dollar <br/>
for a charity they care about for everybox they find on a certain day or <br/>
something....  who knows?!  BeMa<br/>

&gt;How about a REAL challenge and have a different stamp for each charity.  <br/>
&gt;Then<br/>
&gt;people would have to return each month to see what's new.<br/>
&gt;Happy New Year<br/>
