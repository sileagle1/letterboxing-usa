last Thursday and we have already placed 2 boxes and found 4.  (P2F4, how <br/>
cool that you have your own language!) <br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, one of our gang is very talented with carving. (Go Sarah!  She <br/>
also makes fabulous fairy dolls if anyone is interested) We are currently <br/>
working on a trio of stamps for the South Mountain State Battlefield and hope <br/>
to plant them soon.  We were searching for the Washington Monument stamp late <br/>
Saturday evening and I drove us to the battlefield in error.  My car battery <br/>
died but luckily there was a commemorative event going on so a helpful ranger <br/>
jump-started my car.  Since we have already been poking around and no one has <br/>
yet to "box" the joint, we are more than happy to oblige. <br/>
