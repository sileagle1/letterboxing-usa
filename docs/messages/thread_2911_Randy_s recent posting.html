                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am very sorry to read Randy's most recent posting about his <br/>
frustrations and plans to remove his clues from his website. I don't <br/>
claim to know his mind, but Randy  and I have corresponded privately <br/>
at length over the years. If he does withdraw from letterboxing this <br/>
will be a great loss for the hobby. He has been instrumental in the <br/>
development of US letterboxing from the beginning. His recent posting <br/>
was uncharacteristically open about his frustrations. I could see <br/>
this coming, and it was one of the main reasons I raised such a big <br/>
stink a couple months ago about certain contributing issues. However, <br/>
I think the biggest issue is simply that people need to understand <br/>
that there is a need to openly discuss _all_ aspects of the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
As Randy has stated before, most people probably could care less <br/>
about the history and issues that affect the future of the hobby as <br/>
long as the clues magically get listed on the LbNA website (through <br/>
the real considerable work of the volunteer webmasters) and they have <br/>
this list to socialize. That is understandable, and I have no problem <br/>
with it except that there are important issues that need to be <br/>
discussed even though they may not be of interest to everyone. To me, <br/>
open discussion without hostility AND tolerance of postings that <br/>
don't interest any particular individual are key to the health of the <br/>
hobby. Randy appears to have had enough of a lack of tolerance. I can <br/>
certainly understand this. However, I really hope he reconsiders. If <br/>
both Randy and John DeWolf withdraw from actively participating, my <br/>
motivation to continue diminishes considerably. Hopefully that <br/>
doesn't please too many people ;-)<br/>
