Froggy's Hot Date: A Romantic Interlude in Three Parts <br/>
Claude Moore Park, Loudoun County <br/>
21544 Cascades Parkway Sterling, VA <br/>
5 October 2 <br/>
Placed by The Apple Dumpling Gang (adglbna@aol.com) <br/>

FYI:  To a Froggy, this is an extremely long hike.  To a human, it is <br/>
a mere hop, skip, and a jump. <br/>
<br/>
Froggy Goes A Courtin' <br/>
Froggy got off early from work that day. He had a hot date with Robin <br/>
and he needed to make a reservation at the Frog Shackle Diner before <br/>
they booked up. (which makes it sound like froggy would be an entree <br/>
but rest assured this is a family piece despite the romance) Froggy <br/>
was overly concerned because Robin lived off in the woods where the <br/>
paths twisted and turned and crossed each other so many times it <br/>
would be easy for Froggy to get horribly lost.<br/>
<br/>
Froggy parked near the Visitor Center and headed up Vestals Gap Road <br/>
towards the Diner. After securing a great table, he decided to head <br/>
home so he could gussy up. From the road, Froggy went through the <br/>
break in the fence and over the dam towards his pad. Just before <br/>
Froggy hit the field, he took a left onto the hidden path and headed <br/>
around to the back of his pond following the trail over the froggy <br/>
footbridge. At the fork in the road, Froggy headed to the right <br/>
through the trees and stopped for a moment to admire the stars. What <br/>
a romantic evening for dinner with such a fine chick. <br/>
