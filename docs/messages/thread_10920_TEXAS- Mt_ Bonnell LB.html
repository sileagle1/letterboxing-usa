Bonnell LB! I am visiting friends in Austin and have turned them onto <br/>
this great game.  We climbed up the steep stairs to the top, thrashed <br/>
around a bit and them found the site.  The box was in good shape with <br/>
a really beautiful stamp.  We signed in with our yet-to-be permanent <br/>
stamps and plan to take some small family members there later this <br/>
week.  Thank you!!  Compass Rose and Co.  <br/>
