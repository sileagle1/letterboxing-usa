                    <div class="plaintext-content">We drove up to Madison, WI this weekend to visit relatives, catch a <br/>
live broadcast of Michael Feldman's radio show "What D'ya Know?", <br/>
and, of course, look for letterboxes.  There are only two live <br/>
letterboxes in Dane County--E-Way Trails and Cam-Rock Canoe Launch--<br/>
and we were the first finders of both!   These are in fun locations, <br/>
with really nice hand-carved stamps, and the Cam-Rock clues are in a <br/>
code that just tricky enough to be a challenge but not too hard to <br/>
figure out.  We did have to ask locally to find the Cam-Rock park, <br/>
but that was part of the challenge too.  Let me encourage my Chicago-<br/>
area letterboxing compatriots to make the trip.  <br/>
