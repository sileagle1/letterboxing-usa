Park" boxes today.<br/>
First off, when we checked this spring there was a whole mob of <br/>
volunteers cleaning up, weeding and planting, in the proximity of <br/>
the first box. So we just checked the others that day. Later we <br/>
returned to find the first box missing. So sad. But not surprising. <br/>
We sighed deep sighs and edited the clues to a 3, not 4, box series.<br/>
Heard good reports on the remaining boxes over the summer, and went <br/>
out to check them today. We were thrilled to see that the park staff <br/>
had obtained a stamp and logged into one box on their lunch hour one <br/>
day! Thinking they may have found out about the sport from the <br/>
missing letterbox being turned in by the over-ambitious gardeners of <br/>
the spring, we guessed further that they may have returned the first <br/>
box to its hiding place. Bingo! Sort of. No note from staff in box, <br/>
notes from non-letterboxers in box, not quite where we'd hidden it, <br/>
but it's back! We have no clue where it was when it was gone.<br/>
So, for anyone interested in doing or completing the series, all 4 <br/>
boxes are in place and the clues revised again.<br/>
(And YES, the Critter Collection box is there, too. We TOLD you the <br/>
empty stump was the wrong one!)<br/>
