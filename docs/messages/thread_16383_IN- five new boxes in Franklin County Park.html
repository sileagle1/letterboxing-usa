Franklin County Park<br/>
<br/>
Near Cedar Grove, Indiana<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Rough trail with a slope (down on the way in and up on the way out)<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
This box is in the Franklin County park. From I-74, take the Brookville exit (first exit across the border from Ohio). Go North. You'll pass the Little Historic Baptist church, so you might want to look for clues of that name :-)<br/>
When you see the Arby's, take the next road to the left (across the tracks/bridge). The park is a few tenths of a mile on the right. When you enter, stay to the left and look for the square green sign that says "Hilltop overlook" It's a one way loop street. Go up to the overlook and park in front of the shelter on the left (near the bathrooms). Watch for wildlife like turtles, hawks, deer, and pileated woodpeckers (I saw all of those when I placed the first box here). Note: this park has some really nice, private camping spots.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Go down the trail that starts near the back corner of the Hilltop shelter. Watch for rocks in the trail. When you start to see them, look on your right for a pile of cut logs close to the trail. 16 paces down the trail from the logs, look on your left for a fairly big double trunk tree. The microbox is on the backside of the tree under a rock. <br/>
<br/>
Please wedge the rock into the crevice (without crushing the box) so that the forest critters cant drag it away.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I recommend looking for The Offer next. <br/>

Go down the trail that starts near the back corner of the Hilltop shelter. I recommend looking for Badges first. About 25 paces after Badges, the trail comes to the top of a small hill. Go down the hill to the fence. The trail turns right and follows the fence, but youre not going right, youre looking left for a large oak that used to have a partner. Look on the backside of what is left of the partner under a rock for the microbox. Please wedge the rock back in place without crushing the box.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I suggest looking for Who ya gonna call next<br/>

Who Ya Gonna Call?!<br/>

Part of the famous movie lines series, of course, this one is from Ghost Busters.<br/>

I recommend looking for Badges and the offer first. On your way back up the trail from the offer, watch on your right for the urinal tree. 17 paces farther up the trail is a triple trunk tree about three paces from the trail. The microbox is under a rock behind the triple trunked tree. <br/>
