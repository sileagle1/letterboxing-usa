                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm wondering if anyone can confirm that these two letterboxes are <br/>
still in place?  I am an active geocacher and benchmark hunter and <br/>
have also done a few letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
My wife and I went after these to LBs shortly after our introduction <br/>
to GPS/navigation games and came up empty.  Now, about two years <br/>
later and much more experienced, I would like to attempt them again.<br/>
<br/>
After our original failure, I e-mailed Randy, and if I remember <br/>
right, received a response which basically said "I don't really <br/>
remember much about them".  I moved on, but now I am back.  I have <br/>
seen Randy's web site this time, and understand his position on <br/>
giving hints and helps.  No problem.  The one thing I would like is <br/>
some kind of confirmation that what I am seeking still exists.<br/>
<br/>
I don't intend to disparage LB by comparing it to geocaching, but <br/>
with a geocache I at least know when it was last found (or not <br/>
found).  I'm a big map freak, and am drawn to LB, but I feel waylaid <br/>
by the lack of information that would tell me if a particular box is <br/>
missing and shouldn't be searched for.<br/>
<br/>
As I stated before, LB is the activity which I am least experienced <br/>
in, so I am looking for any helpful insight anyone can provide.<br/>
<br/>
Randy, I see your a member here to, so please don't take anything I <br/>
have said with disrespect towards you.<br/>
