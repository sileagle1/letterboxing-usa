We had the honor of finding 5 of  dvn2r ckr's letterboxes on a trip north on <br/>
I-5 this weekend. (we found 15 total between Willows and Grants Pass, OR) We <br/>
are happy to report that Damned Shasta, Packers Bay, Shasta Shade, Hedge Creek <br/>
Falls, and Source of the Sacramento were not only alive and well but gave us <br/>
great joy! Our very favorite was Hedge Creek Falls! <br/>
<br/>
We've passed through Dunsmuir many times in our travels but didn't realize <br/>
what wonderful parks they have there! It's obvious they sure take pride in them! <br/>
We highly recommend the Cornerstone Bakery and deli for lunch and the best <br/>
focaccia bread we've ever had! (took a loaf home with us!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to dvn2r ckr for the great clues, beautiful views and nice stamps. <br/>
<br/>
BTW: We MAY have placed a hitchhiker in one of his boxes. . .<br/>

yet.  I'm a her, BTW.  ;)  We'll definitely try the bakery &amp; deli <br/>
next time we head through the area.<br/>

Can't wait to look for the new Shakespeare LB in Ashland!  Now I've <br/>
just got to come up with a reason to escape down there for a <br/>
bit...hmmmm...  ;)<br/>

If you're asking us, we were talking about the letterboxes in Dunsmuir, CA <br/>
and the Cornerstone Bakery and Deli there.<br/>
