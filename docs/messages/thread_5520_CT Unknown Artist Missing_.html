views. The instructions were excellent and we found Blue Griffin, <br/>
Purple Serpentine Dragon, and White Elephant with no problem. I am <br/>
sure I was at the right spot for Unknown Artist but found the spot <br/>
empty. Can anyone confirm if it is missing or am I just wrong and <br/>
missed it. Anyway, I thought it was a great series excellent views, <br/>
and stamp great carvings. Congratulations to the planter of these <br/>
boxes for a job well done.....Chuck &amp; Molly, P31F95X10 Mansfield CT<br/>
