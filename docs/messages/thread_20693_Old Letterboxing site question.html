Through a couple of links I found the old letterboxing.com site. I <br/>
found clues to two boxes in a series that are not on the new site. <br/>
The first was missing, the second was found. The last person to log <br/>
in did so in April of 2003. I tried to contact the placer with no <br/>
response in three weeks. I like the site. Should I..<br/>
<br/>
1.  Assume everything is the way the placer wants it? (the clue to <br/>
become retired)<br/>
<br/>
2. Place my own somewhere else in this smallish stand of trees?<br/>
<br/>
3. Make another effort to see what the intentions of the placer are?<br/>
<br/>
4. ??????<br/>
<br/>
Any random thoughts would be great!<br/>

P.S.  How does one go about adopting an orphan?<br/>
