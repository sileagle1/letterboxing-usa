Castries, St. Lucia<br/>

Planted by rtrw on December 2nd ,2002<br/>

Difficulty - potentially hard to get in to, but easy to find<br/>
Time - 3 minutes if the door is open, longer if you have to make your <br/>
own way.  <br/>
Directions to starting place - Find your way to La Toc Road.  Part<br/>
way up is Bagshaw's Studios where visitors can watch original <br/>
silk-screen patterns being created.  Beyond that is the battery<br/>
<br/>
Details you should know - I didn't get permission to plant this, but <br/>
it's technically outside the battery.  I don't know how often the <br/>
battery doors are opened, but It was Mrs. Bagshaw of the silk screen <br/>
place who gave us our tour.  It might be worth tracking some info <br/>
about a tour before heading up there.  I was on a tour bus and <br/>
everything was arranged for us.<br/>
<br/>
Details you don't need to know - Just a few things I found <br/>
interesting.  St. Lucia is the birthplace of two nobel laureates. Sir <br/>
W. Arthur Lewis won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1979, and poet <br/>
Derek Walcott won the 1992 Nobel Prize for literature. About 150,000 <br/>
people inhabit St Lucia with 60,000 living in its capital, Castries. <br/>
Our tour bus was big enough that it had to back up the hill to the <br/>
battery.  There is room for a couple cars to park.  They have <br/>
displayed some cool pieces they found on the ocean floor.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  <br/>
Find your way to the tunnel.  There is a sign that says machine gun <br/>
implacement.  Head down between the shell store and the artillery <br/>
general store.  The door to the outside is locked when no one is <br/>
there.<br/>
As you exit the tunnel turn left and take 10 steps. On the left side <br/>
of the path near a tree with vines growing on it is a rock and some <br/>
debris.  Under the debris is the thing you seek.  <br/>
This is an orphan box and I don't know that I'll ever get back there <br/>
again.  Any maintenance help is appreciated. Thanks.<br/>
