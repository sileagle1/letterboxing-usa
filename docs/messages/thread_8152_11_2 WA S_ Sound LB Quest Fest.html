Visited this great park recently, got two great(???) stamps, looking forward<br/>
to the event.<br/>
<br/>
Was at the Oregon Gathering, great fun to meet all the people behind the<br/>
stamps in the logs.<br/>
<br/>
Busy month, but should be able to put out some cruddy stamps for everyone's<br/>
amusement (but not derision).<br/>
<br/>
By the way, dvn2r ckr, you aren't looking to well, if you aren't feeling any<br/>
better, you should probably call in sick on the off chance you have to work<br/>
on the 2th.  :-)<br/>

&gt; LOCATION:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fort Steilacoom Park<br/>
&gt; 8714 87th Ave SW<br/>
&gt; Lakewood, WA<br/>
&gt; Pierce County<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From I-5 North &amp; South:  To get to Fort Steilacoom Park from<br/>
&gt; Interstate 5, take Exit 125 toward Lakewood. Turn left on Steilacoom<br/>
&gt; Boulevard. Turn left on 87th Ave SW, right on Dresden Lane SW.<br/>
&gt; Follow the road past the sports fields.  You will eventually see<br/>
&gt; some old, red barns in front of and to your right.  Look for the<br/>
&gt; parking lot behind (&amp; left of) Barn #2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Park Info:  This park is already home to 2 letterboxes (WA<br/>
&gt; Territorial Insane Asylum &amp; Heath Farm).  It is the largest public<br/>
&gt; park in the region (although it's still relatively small--I couldn't<br/>
&gt; plan one in a National Park) and offers a little bit of everything<br/>
&gt; (ranging from extremely interesting history, many trails, a lake, a<br/>
&gt; cemetery, an old farm with silo, playground with playing fields,<br/>
&gt; trees, old mental asylum buildings, model boating, picnic area, you<br/>
&gt; name it).  It is home to many ducks, geese, rabbits, fish, snakes<br/>
&gt; (we found them yesterday), blackberries and myriad trees of NW<br/>
&gt; origin.  We've also seen Bald Eagles and Mt Rainier (weather<br/>
&gt; dependent) while visiting.  Historic Ft Steilacoom and Western WA<br/>
&gt; State Hospital are located directly across the street.  This is all<br/>
&gt; great fodder for some interesting letterboxes!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope to see you then!<br/>
