You guys know how to throw a really fun picnic! We were so glad to be able to celebrate with you . . . I know you're going to slow down now, right? . . .Seriously, it was a blast, and the stamps were awesome!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, Ellen, I am planning to slow down, and already have - considerably! Not only is the <br/>
chronic fatigue/fibromyalgia still kicking my butt from time to time (like right now, for <br/>
instance!), but I'm just plain tired of  reading clues all the time and running around chasing <br/>
down little boxes almost every single day! (As I keep telling folks, I just need to kick back <br/>
now and again with a good old book as a change of pace from a steady diet of letterbox <br/>
clues, and, whereas some folks take a vacation FOR letterboxing, I've been boxing so hard <br/>
and for so long that I need to take a vacation FROM letterboxing!:-)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, though, I still love letterboxing, and hope to continue to do so for quite a while <br/>
yet, but I've definitely become more selective. Just like on my last trip down to the <br/>
Southern Appalachians, I stayed out hiking in the mountains almost the whole time and <br/>
enjoyed many boxes that rarely if ever get visited. I only dropped down out of the <br/>
mountains for a couple of days of "urban boxing", mostly in the Gatlinburg and Asheville <br/>
areas, which were not nearly as appealing to me as the mountain hikes, so please don't <br/>
expect me to go chasing after all those "easy pickin's" that are so popular with some of the <br/>
newer folks nowadays, although I'm sure we've all enjoyed a few of them!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, with limited time and energy left, if I mostly try to do just the longer letterbox <br/>
hunts that more appeal to me, I'll never get to my originally stated goal of PFX 25,000 <br/>
(unless I were to resort to considering virtuals, postals, cooties and such as "letterboxing", <br/>
but that will certainly never happen!:-) And I still intend to keep my percentage of <br/>
gathering-type "SWOH" ("Stamps without Hikes or Hunts") well  below 5% of my total <br/>
count, so I definitely need to continue to do considerably more real letterbox "hunting" <br/>
rather than "gathering"!  But, even if I never reach that next goal, that's OK because I'm <br/>
just so glad that I got to celebrate PFX 20K and know that I've worked longer and harder at <br/>
letterboxing - just like I did with my 25,000-plus miles of long-distance backpacking in <br/>
the 80's and 90's - than most folks could ever even begin to imagine!<br/>
<br/>
So, after what seems like years of spending more nights "camping out", on the trail or on <br/>
the road, than sleeping at home, getting bleary-eyed with late night clue reading, getting <br/>
up at the crack of dawn to climb a snowy mountain or cross a sweltering desert - yes, it's <br/>
definitely time to slow down. Nowadays it seems Pete and I almost never even get going <br/>
before noon, and I'm finally coming to realize that there are going to be quite a few states, <br/>
people and places that I just won't be able to get back to visit, as I had once hoped. All I <br/>
can say is that I'm really glad that I got to hike in all 50 states and visit many other <br/>
countries while I could, and now I'll probably be staying closer to home. Oh, I'll still <br/>
letterbox when the spirit moves me, but it's going to be "part-time", not "full-time", and I <br/>
hope that people will still be glad, wherever we do  get to go, if I take the time to visit <br/>
their boxes and write something in their logbooks - even if it's just "thanks"!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Wanda<br/>
