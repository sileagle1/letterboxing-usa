Well, obviously some noxer found it and reported it to the police, <br/>
which they in turn 'investigated' the 'suspicious package' (9/11 and <br/>
all that). Being (I think!) good sports about it they investigated <br/>
the report and returned it to its proper place instead of removing <br/>
it. They were also kind enough to give notice to all those <br/>
unsuspecting noxers who are brave enough to open it that it is safe <br/>
to open .. LOL!!!.  Maybe there are some 'boys in blue' that are <br/>
boxers themselves!  <br/>
<br/>
I give them credit for respecting the hobby no matter how it is <br/>
disguised!<br/>

"Girlfriend still alive, but this time she's rather annoyed with me..."  <br/>
<br/>
Something to that effect.  I found it a year ago, so it's fuzzy in my mind.<br/>

&gt; Well, I found a box with a not-at-all-funny note in<br/>
&gt; it. An apparent noxer (no stamp or trail name) wrote<br/>
&gt; an eight page racist diatribe in the logbook,<br/>
&gt; advocating violence against certain races, cultures<br/>
&gt; and entire countries, with the goal of eliminating<br/>
&gt; them and leaving this country for his/her PURE race.<br/>
&gt; I couldn't read the whole thing-I just couldn't<br/>
&gt; stomach it. They referred to themself as one of "the<br/>
&gt; true patriots."<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was letterboxing on Cape Cod this weekend. In the<br/>
&gt; &gt; journal for the Fort Hill<br/>
&gt; &gt; box, the Eastham police had written a note that they<br/>
&gt; &gt; had found the box,<br/>
&gt; &gt; checked it and that they were no dangerous contents<br/>
&gt; &gt; inside. Struck me as funny.<br/>
