left.  Cross over the bridge and continue on the trail along the <br/>
lake.  Pass by the 2 benches and follow the curves - see the <br/>
shelterhouse up on the hill?  At the bottom of the hill look to your <br/>
right to the end of the fence.  There are 2 logs at the east end of <br/>
the fence.  Next to the hill behind the eastmost log you will find <br/>
what you seek.  Be discreet  this is a busy trail.  You may continue <br/>
on around the lake for a really nice walk, or return the way you came.<br/>

* This is a microbox *<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Begin at the parking area across from the Kingfisher <br/>
trailhead.  Begin at the sign reading "Wetlands Restoration".  Follow <br/>
the trail around the bend to the fork.  Continue past the bench.  <br/>
Stop at the looping vine overhanging the trail before you descend <br/>
down to the creek.  Look to your right and walk to the 2 trees <br/>
standing alone.  Now look left at the huge double tree.  In the <br/>
crotch of the tree you will find the camo microbox.  You may continue <br/>
down the hill and take the lower loop back to the parking lot.<br/>

Blue Willow<br/>
<br/>
Location:	Winton Woods, Winton Road, Cincinnati, Ohio<br/>
Directions:	Take I-275 to Winton Road-Forest Park exit, south on <br/>
Winton Road to park entrances on left and right.  Also accessible via <br/>
Ronald Reagan-Cross County Highway to Winton Road exit, north on <br/>
Winton Road to park entrances.<br/>
Level:	Easy find, easy trail<br/>
Need:	Stamp, stamp pad, pen<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Begin at the Sycamore Valley parking area.  Cross the foot <br/>
bridge and begin walking to your right along the treeline.  Walk <br/>
until you hit the paved trail.  Be careful when crossing the wire <br/>
barrier!  Continue down the gravel trail meandering along the <br/>
stream.  You will come to a "No Bikes" sign.  Walk around the <br/>
barrier.  See those stairs up the hill?  Climb the steps and walk to <br/>
the beginning of the boardwalk.  At the trail map post look to your <br/>
left.  At the bottom of the 2nd post from the left is the blue <br/>
willow.  He is sad that he cannot be by the stream but the spring <br/>
rains would carry him away  (P.S.  His hiding place is oh so close <br/>
to Team Jedi's "Fore!" box.)<br/>
