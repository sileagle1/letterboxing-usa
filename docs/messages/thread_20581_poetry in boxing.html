&gt;&gt; One thing her Ladyship would like to suggest for clue writers though<br/>
&gt;&gt; is that unless one is a published poet please avoid the bad rhyming<br/>
&gt;&gt; clues. Her Ladyship has read more nauseatingly bad poetry since taking<br/>
&gt;&gt; up this past time than she feels any sentient being should ever have<br/>
&gt;&gt; to endure.<br/>

&gt; Oh dear.  I am one of those clue writers.  Two of my 3 boxes have bad<br/>
&gt; rhyming clues, lol.  BUT, I think poetry should be available to anyone<br/>
&gt; -  nauseatingly bad or not, published poet or not.  :)<br/>

Perhaps if one honestly assesses one's poetry and it approaches the <br/>
standards of the Vogon race, one might reconsider. Unless it truly is <br/>
that bad, well, variety is one of the spices that makes this pastime so <br/>
much fun!<br/>
