&gt;Should also mention that due to the expansion of Route 66, the usual<br/>
&gt;parking spot for Mt. Higby is a bit torn up. Plan on parking at<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's where I'm talking about. The "dirt pull off" is currently<br/>
freshly dug up--very soft and deep--and sometimes has heavy equipment<br/>
parked on it.<br/>
<br/>
I personally recommend caution as a vehicle could get stuck or be in<br/>
the way if work is going on...but it's up to the individual. It's<br/>
legal to drive on unless its gated or posted, so whatever.<br/>
