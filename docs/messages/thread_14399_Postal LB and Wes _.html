By the way Wes, where are you from?!?!   <br/>

-Steve and Heidi <br/>

PS - Had a nice day today working with Patrick. Didn;t get to box at <br/>
all, but it certainly was the topic of discussion most of the day!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well - unfortunately, the postal box is already navigating the USPS.  <br/>
Hopefully the first person to receive it will post to the list.  I'm <br/>
actually not sure if Wes was on the list at all.  (trying to remember <br/>
if I ever rec'd his mailing address for the list).<br/>
<br/>
Adding folks to the list at this point is going to be trickier, <br/>
because it will mean catching the box wherever it is,and asking <br/>
whoever has it to add the person on.<br/>
<br/>
Wes - if you want to be on the list, let me know.<br/>
