Barry's Macleay Park letterbox in Portland, OR<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead:  From NW 23rd going north, turn left onto Lovejoy.  <br/>
Keep going as Lovejoy turns into Cornell, and you pass under two <br/>
tunnels.  A short distance beyond the second tunnel, you will see the <br/>
parking lot for Macleay Park on your right.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:  Start at the big map of Forrest Park near the <br/>
restrooms.  See the steps down to Wildwood trail?  Go down them and <br/>
start heading toward the stream.  Once you get to the stream, cross <br/>
it and follow it on the other side.  When you find a stone edifice, <br/>
take the low road along the stream.  A little ways further, you'll <br/>
find a post with a green sign warning you to keep your dogs on <br/>
leashes.  From this post, the letterbox is hidden in a tree stump <br/>
about 40 feet to the north under some rocks and bark.<br/>
