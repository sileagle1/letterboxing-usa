Try these:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.oplin.lib.oh.us/products/tree/<br/>
http://www.arborday.org/trees/treeID.html<br/>
<br/>
I carry a copy of the "National Audubon Society Field Guide to the <br/>
Mid-Atlantic States" in my pack. They publish them for various regions of <br/>
the US (Southeastern, Southwestern, Rocky Mountain, Pacific Northwest, New <br/>
England). I like this publication because it's all-inclusive -- they cover <br/>
trees, plants, birds, animals with descriptions and color photos in one <br/>
volume. Audubon does publish individual guides to trees, birds, rocks and <br/>
minerals, seashells, etc., but it's a lot easier to carry one book than <br/>
several! They're $20 each -- but $13.97 at Amazon.com (or you can get some <br/>
of them for $9.99 used).<br/>
<br/>
Make sure to search for "National Audubon Society Field Guide to ...", <br/>
since there are lots of Audubon field guides in and out of print.<br/>

We bought an Audobon Society book which has helped us indentify<br/>
many types of trees, plants, birds and other subspecies of <br/>
species we never even knew existed, such as "Pinus Rigida" (we<br/>
had fun with that one) and Strix Varia. Have fun!<br/>

Canada" by Willam M. Harlow, published as part of the Dover field <br/>
guide series. I'm choosing it over others because that's what Wayne <br/>
uses when he teaches the Tree I.D. course at the New York Botanical <br/>
Garden. The key being the key. Any guide is good for answering "what <br/>
does an oak look like?" but when you have an unidentified tree in <br/>
front of you, you want a "dichotomous" (sp?) key. It gives you a <br/>
series of "is it like this or that?" (choice of only two answers)<br/>
questions about leaves, bark, fruits, etc., with each answer leading <br/>
you to the next question. When you answer the final question, the <br/>
answer leads you to the description page of the tree in question.<br/>
The home-school mom in me has to mention that this is great for <br/>
building observation skills. You may need to bring a small hand lens <br/>
along to check for things like fine hairs on leaves.<br/>
