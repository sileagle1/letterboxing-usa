&gt; Don, your cache up near Balanced Rock may be OK, but if so, it's <br/>
very<br/>
&gt; close to the NPS boundary.  The "Circle X Ranch" LB is either on NPS<br/>
&gt; land or on Private Property.<br/>
<br/>
I think that due to the history on Lonewolf's Circle X Box <br/>
(California's first) I will just lay low and not do anything about it <br/>
at this point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 That whole Circle X Ranch area was purchased from the<br/>
&gt; State of California, which got it from the Boy Scouts. <br/>
<br/>
Thinking back, when we found Mugu Peak box in early 2000, we came <br/>
across some what I thought was weird signs at the time. Apparantly we <br/>
had crossed into NPS territory and their was some federal signage in <br/>
what I thought was either State Park or BLM turf.<br/>
Since we were near some federal areas (launch sites?) I just <br/>
discounted it. If we crossed into NPS turf at that time then the area <br/>
must be pretty large.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the NPS googling up letterbox names, this happened when Ron <br/>
Goldman planted a box at Anacapa and we had one at Santa Rosa.<br/>
<br/>
Both were named as such and our Santa Rosa box went unchecked until <br/>
they came upon his Anacapa titled Letterbox. There is only one <br/>
Anacapa, but more than one Santa Rosa.<br/>
<br/>
THe NPS held the boxes for Ron, and he picked them up. We were <br/>
tempted to write clues to the Ventura NPS office, but thought that <br/>
wouldn't go over very well. Actually our stamp went into his <br/>
Ennisbrook series.<br/>
