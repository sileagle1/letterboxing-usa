The trip was phenomenal (cruise through the Panama canal), but it's really<br/>
nice to be home in what I consider prime letterboxing weather!!  :P<br/>
<br/>

We went to Hopkinton State Park on Tuesday and to a smaller preserve in<br/>
Hopkinton today.    Both boxes we saught were in great shape, though today's<br/>
box was very unhidden, so we made sure it was well hidden before leaving.<br/>
<br/>

Just wanted to toss out a friendly warning that the ticks are bad!!!!!<br/>
While the dogs haven't picked any up yet (that I've found!), I've pulled two<br/>
imbedded ticks out of ME in the past 3 days.   BLECH!    One was definitely<br/>
a benign dog tick, the other, I'm not so sure.    Doc put me back on<br/>
Doxy..ugh!     Anyway, heads up to those who are out 'boxing.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow's supposed to be gorgeous, and I'm considering hitting a few<br/>
different boxes..maybe High Rock in Wrentham, or one of the Moose Hill boxes<br/>
in Sharon, or possibly buzzing up to Sudburry to find some boxes up there.<br/>
Life should be full of such difficult decisions!  ;P<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's great to be back out!!!   (I don't miss the bugs and poison ivy one<br/>
bit!)<br/>
