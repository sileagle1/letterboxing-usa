Just like stamps, boxes, clues, and locations chosen for boxes <br/>
there can be 'crappy' hitch hikers and wonderful hitch hikers.  It <br/>
has everything to do with the thought or work going into the HH.<br/>
<br/>
My kids like making HH's because it is easier for them than <br/>
planting a box.  Great for them, too bad for the finders. I am less <br/>
likely to plant a HH unless it is something special. Still, I would <br/>
rather find a crappy HH made by a kid than none at all.<br/>
<br/>
 Happy Mom and I have made a couple of really nicely packaged <br/>
HH's that we are quite proud of.  The complexity of the stamp or <br/>
the packaging  or the concept is what makes it great to us (at <br/>
least from a creator's perspective). <br/>
<br/>
It does seem like there are an abundance of them in the NW <br/>
though.   I think that those folks who get to travel the country <br/>
frequently should try to gather them up from one particular area <br/>
and freely deposit them in far flung areas when they can.  You <br/>
know, Amanda, it was good to see some of the east coast sig <br/>
stamps in a HH log book that I recently came across which you <br/>
were responsible for transporting across the continent.  As long <br/>
as we keep getting blessed by your efforts, I say everyone should <br/>
keep the HH's coming.<br/>
<br/>
Thats my opinion.<br/>

<br/>
I disagree. Out of over 200 finds, we have encountered only 5 <br/>
hitchhikers. For us, that's only about one every 5 months.<br/>
<br/>
You could consider them "lazy-boys'" boxes, but when we've made HHs, <br/>
they have a story to them which gives them a reason to travel (if you <br/>
ever encounter Peter J. McGuire, you'll never think us lazy if you <br/>
actually read his story. Writing it took much longer and was more work <br/>
than writing clues). Also, we put them in their own box, as most boxes <br/>
around here aren't large enough to hold a second book etc.<br/>
<br/>
If you have too many HHs on the west coast, send them off to far away <br/>
places so that the rest of us can enjoy finding them. :)<br/>

<br/>
Which is a good point.  I've always thought the world (or at least<br/>
letterboxing) would be better off if we all just ignored what we didn't<br/>
like.  I mean, I ignore the "geojunk" I find in geocaches and letterboxes <br/>
(that I believe geocachers leave in them) and that seems to work out <br/>
(sorry, I just love that word, and had to find a way to use it ... I<br/>
really have nothing against geocaching, but ain't that a pretty word ...)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, onto the specific point -- I wish everyone was as "lazy"<br/>
as to create something like the Hatbox Caper and the 9 hitchhikers <br/>
that are part of the bargain.  It took me alot of effort to do that,<br/>
and I never considered it lazy.  I really think its kinda cool, and an<br/>
example of a way to turn the putative ubiquitous hitchhiker lemons into <br/>
lemonade (putative, ubiquitous, or otherwise).  As with all things, <br/>
there is the good, the bad, and the ugly (the sentence before being an <br/>
example of the "ugly"), and sometimes "in moderation" makes sense, <br/>
sometimes geojunk dilutes the beauty, but we all agree that unagi is <br/>
the best sushi.<br/>
<br/>
So, thats my final answer in this thread.  Can't wait to download my<br/>
mail on the morrow ;-)<br/>

use Speedball's white carving medium from Michaels--it falls apart <br/>
almost instantly!!!) otherwise it would have stayed there for the <br/>
next lucky finder instead.  Still need more sleep...but still <br/>
looking forward to finding other folks' hitchhikers, too!  ;)  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'll throw my two cents in for what it's worth.<br/>
<br/>
Out of the first 100 letterboxes I found, I didn't find a single <br/>
hitchhiker.  Out of the second set of 100 letterboxes I found, six <br/>
were hitchhikers.  And from the third set of 100 letterboxes I've <br/>
found, ten were hitchhikers.<br/>
<br/>
I'm kind of torn on the subject--I think hitchhikers provide a very <br/>
good 'service' in a sense.  It allows people like me to see some <br/>
signature stamps from the east coast I'd otherwise never get a chance <br/>
to see.  It allows people on the east coast the ability to find <br/>
a "Ryan box" without actually having to go to the west coast.<br/>
<br/>
And a well-crafted hitchhiker can be a great find.  I created a <br/>
hitchhiker named "Joe" a while back because he "escaped" from prison <br/>
and was running from the law.  A cute little story for why the guy <br/>
was "on the run" and jumping from box to box.  (Even better, it was a <br/>
follow up to my "Murder At Gabriel Park!" series, and I thought the <br/>
tie-in was pretty clever.)  Amanda from Seattle created an Alfred <br/>
Hitchcock hitchhiker--how cool is THAT?  Anyone with the word 'hitch' <br/>
in his name OUGHT to be a hitchhiker!  And the K-Martha hitchhiker <br/>
has such a wonderful history behind it.  These kind of hitchhikers I <br/>
think are an absolute joy to find!<br/>
<br/>
But I also think a lot--possibily even MOST--of hitchhikers are <br/>
created out of laziness so the creator doesn't have to find a hiding <br/>
spot, create clues, and so on.  Some have been so lazy, they don't <br/>
even carve their own stamp but run out to the store to buy them!  <br/>
Frankly, I don't think it reflects well on the person who'd hide such <br/>
a box, but they'll do it anyway.  (I haven't actually found any of <br/>
those, but I've heard about them and if I ever DO come across one, I <br/>
will NOT pick it up!  A store-bought stamp in a regular letterbox I <br/>
frown at, but putting one as a hitchhiker I think is unforgiveable!)  <br/>
<br/>
But the bottom line for me is that hitchhikers used to be a rare <br/>
treat that were a joy to find.  Now they're a dime a dozen and I <br/>
don't really get too excited about finding them anymore.  I've even <br/>
been heard to groan at finding a couple of them, sad to say.<br/>
<br/>
There might be some merit to the argument that some areas are <br/>
overpopulated while others are underserved, which could explain the <br/>
varity of opinions people are sure to express.  Hitchhikers certainly <br/>
aren't distributed evenly, although out here in the west I tend to <br/>
think there's too many and would like to see a halt to new ones--at <br/>
least for awhile until they move on or die of natural causes.<br/>
<br/>
I hid a few a while back before I had found ANY hitchhikers because I <br/>
thought there was a severe lack of them at the time.  And that was my <br/>
primary reason FOR hiding them, but I really didn't get a whole lot <br/>
of satisfaction out of hiding them.  For one thing, I'd say at least <br/>
half the time they go somewhere, I don't even hear about it.  I have <br/>
no way to verify if the box is still alive and well or DOA.  If the <br/>
box travels particularly far, I'll never be able to go back and see <br/>
all the wonderful things people have written in it.  Basically, <br/>
they're the least favorite boxes that I've hidden!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I think everyone has the right to hide a few--regardless of <br/>
whether your area is saturated or not--if for no other reason than to <br/>
hope they head far away and you can "show off" your stamps in areas <br/>
you'd otherwise never get to visit.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, unless there's a good reason for why it should be a <br/>
hitchhiker rather than a regular letterbox, I'd rather see them as <br/>
regular letterboxes.  Then I can actively hunt them down rather than <br/>
find them by blind luck, know what I mean?<br/>
<br/>
I washed my hands of hiding hitchhikers over a year ago due to <br/>
oversaturation--with one exception only because the stamp was of a <br/>
scummy looking person that really DID look like a hitchhiker--it <br/>
would have been criminal NOT to make him a hitchhiker!  But you can <br/>
bet I won't be hiding more than one hitchhiker for every 50 or so <br/>
regular letterboxes that I hide.  That seems like about the right <br/>
about to me: One hitchhiker for every 50 boxes would be perfect.  <br/>
Fully 2% of the letterboxes out there.  Everyone will have a <br/>
different opinion on that, I suppose, where some will say that's too <br/>
much and others say it's not enough, and my opinion on that matter <br/>
isn't more or less right than anyone else.  But seeing as I'm <br/>
currently finding hitchhikers in about 10% of the boxes I find, <br/>
that's about five times past my tolerance level for them!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I think I need to add to my Creating Great Boxes webpage and <br/>
add a special section about hitchhikers.  =)  My goodness, how did I <br/>
miss a category that large?!<br/>
<br/>
And since we're on the subject of hitchhikers--I haven't heard <br/>
anything about ANY of the ones I've hidden for at least six months <br/>
now.  If anyone has any information about their current locations or <br/>
travels, please let me know via e-mail!  You can see all of my <br/>
hitchhikers (and their known travels!) at <br/>

Sometimes it's fun to take them "visiting" to other letterboxes before I<br/>
ultimately place them for someone else to find.  Flutterby has fluttered<br/>

I suppose it's a matter of preference and the more you letterbox, the<br/>
more likely it is you'll run across hitchhikers along the way.  I have<br/>
never made a hitchhiker myself and do not plan to.  There are enough out<br/>
there and the people who like to place them seem pretty profuse about<br/>
it, so let them go for it.  I'll just feel lucky when I stumble upon one<br/>
in my travels.  I can deal with it.  They are no bother to me.<br/>

<br/>
I have done over 200 letterboxes and have found only 6 hitchhikers.  <br/>
That is less than one in every 30 boxes.  So I say no, there are not <br/>
too many hitchhikers out there.  Perhaps it depends where you live.  <br/>
I live in north east where there are probably 1000 letterboxes within <br/>
a 1 hour drive of my house.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the beauties of letterboxing is that it is an unregulated <br/>
hobby.  Everyone can do it at their own pace and interest level.  <br/>
People enjoy it for different reasons.  I agree with you that making <br/>
a hitchhiker box can be pretty easy.  Buy a stamp &amp; a notebook, put <br/>
them in a zip lock bag and voila! instant letterbox.  I guess I would <br/>
say, so what?  Some people enjoy spending a great deal of time <br/>
writing the perfect clues (thank you very much to those people!), <br/>
some people enjoy finding the perfect spot for the letterbox, others <br/>
enjoy carving the perfect stamp.  However you enjoy the hobby, the <br/>
key word is ENJOY.  If people enjoy putting out hitchhikers then they <br/>
should put out hitchhikers.  As you mentioned, there is no rule that <br/>
says if a person finds a HH they have to take it or even that they <br/>
have to log into it.  The hitchhiker can be totally ignore if the <br/>
person wishes as if it wasn't even there.<br/>
<br/>
The two points I would like to leave you with are:<br/>
<br/>
1.  I only find HH about 1 every 2 months.  I am still thrilled when <br/>
I find one.  <br/>
2.  I hate to see restrictions put on letterboxing. I guess you could <br/>
call me a bleeding heart liberal, but I think the sport of <br/>
letterboxing should be unregulated so that everyone can enjoy the <br/>
hobby in the manner that suits them best.  Letterboxing is fun.  <br/>
Let's see that it stays that way.<br/>
<br/>
thank you for letting me ramble,<br/>

<br/>
The first letterbox I ever made was a hitchhiker. I was new to the <br/>
sport of letterboxing and wanted to contribute in some way.  I spent <br/>
a great deal of time carving the stamp for my hitchhiker and was very <br/>
proud of how it turned out.  I wrote a little story line to go with <br/>
my cute stamp then found a nice spot to release my creation.  I had a <br/>
hard time parting with this, my first stamp, and it a little puppy to <br/>
boot.  None the less I found a letterbox in a really neat spot where <br/>
I thought my little hitchhiking pup would like to wait for his first <br/>
ride.<br/>
<br/>
Image my joy when a short time later I got a wonderful email from the <br/>
finder telling me that it was their first hitchhiker and how much <br/>
they loved my little carved dog.<br/>
<br/>
I got one more email from someone else who found it. That was back in <br/>
April of last year.  I have not heard of my little traveller's <br/>
whereabouts since.  I am sad to have lost this, my first letterbox <br/>
and first carved stamp.  Yet that is the risk one faces when creating <br/>
a hitchhiker.<br/>

had HH.  I never really thought of them as "the lazy man's <br/>
letterbox", rather just a fun variance from the routine box.<br/>
<br/>
I would tend to agree with something Ryan said about not getting as <br/>
much satisfaction when I place a hitchhiker...  I like putting the <br/>
whole box together, including finding the spot and writing the <br/>
clues.  And then you have the issue that once you release your HH, <br/>
you may never hear anything about it, since many people (most?) do <br/>
not take the time to e-mail when they find it.<br/>
<br/>
But, on the other hand, it is also kind of a challenge...  a little <br/>
gamble that maybe, just maybe, you will put out your hitcher and <br/>
somewhere down the road you will hear of his whereabouts and his <br/>
travels...  or better yet, you may stumble across him in a box <br/>
yourself.<br/>
<br/>
But it is just like everything else in this hobby, we all have <br/>
different aspects we like and some we don't particularly care about.  <br/>
The good thing is that without a lot of rules, it is flexible enough <br/>
to take what you like and ignore what you don't.  <br/>
<br/>
When I first read the subject line "too many hitchhikers" I couldn't <br/>
help but think of a song about having "too much fun"<br/>
<br/>
Too much fun? What's that mean?<br/>
It's like too much money, there's no such thing<br/>
It's like a girl too pretty, with too much class<br/>
Being too lucky, a car too fast<br/>
No matter what they say I've done<br/>
I ain't never had too much fun...<br/>
<br/>
I still think finding a HH is fun!<br/>

I<br/>really have nothing against geocaching, but ain't that a pretty word ...)<br/><br/>Of course, onto the specific point -- I wish everyone was as "lazy"<br/>as to create something like the Hatbox Caper and the 9 hitchhikers <br/>that are part of the bargain.  It took me alot of effort to do that,<br/>and I never considered it lazy.  I really think its kinda cool, and an<br/>example of a way to turn the putative ubiquitous hitchhiker lemons into <br/>lemonade (putative, ubiquitous, or otherwise).  As with all things, <br/>there is the good, the bad, and the ugly (the sentence before being an <br/>example of the "ugly"), and sometimes "in moderation" makes sense, <br/>sometimes geojunk dilutes the beauty, but we all agree that unagi is <br/>the best sushi.<br/><br/>So, thats my final answer in this thread.  Can't wait to download my<br/>mail on the morrow ;-)<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your use of Yahoo!
