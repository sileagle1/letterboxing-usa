With the heightened anticipation with each passing clue, that once the location is finally disclosed, all the locals will want to be the "first finders" and rush to the location. I know there is a Boo Boo Box, has anyone created a Speeding Ticket Box?<br/>

I asked "Is it located in CT?" for Question 6, but it was not the randomly<br/>

&gt; that was the most ridiculous question. who even thought that would be <br/>
&gt; any help? we waited 2 days and we still don't know what state its <br/>

&gt; mass or is it in CT? <br/>
