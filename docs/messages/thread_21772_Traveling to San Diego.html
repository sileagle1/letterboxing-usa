We failed to find this one when we looked in January. I never felt<br/>
sure I was looking in the right spot since some of the plants were<br/>
grown together and counting them was difficult. However, the spot is<br/>
well worth a visit.  We also failed to find the Last Man box. If you<br/>
have extra time to get out to Anza Borrego, there are very nice walks<br/>
and stamps hidden there and maybe some of the incredible wildflower<br/>
action will still be happening. Funhog<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was just in San Diego last month and had the opportunity to do several<br/>
LBs. A couple that I recommend (if you have transportation are just north<br/>
of San Diego in La Jolla. "La Jolla" placed by Cadenza is an amazingly<br/>
beautiful walk along the cliffs  overlooking the Pacific Ocean with lots of<br/>
brown pelicans, wildflowers, and an incredible view. It is also in the<br/>
heart of La Jolla shopping district with wonderful restaurants if you are<br/>
so inclined. I left a HH in this box, but haven't heard anything "from it",<br/>
so if you happen to pick it up, let me know. Another beautiful walk is just<br/>
a few miles up the coast at the Scripps Coastal Reserve in La Jolla - the<br/>
letterbox called "Tea Time", again with gorgeous views. Then about 5 or 6<br/>
miles north of that is the San Diego Sails Letterbox which you can combine<br/>
with a walk on the beach and a short hike through the hills above the<br/>
ocean. I also tried to find the Pacific Crest Trail LB to no avail. I'm<br/>
pretty sure I located the spot where it should have been but after<br/>
relentless searching, came up dry. The Pacific Crest Trail is about an hour<br/>
east of San Diego off Interstate 8. It's a beautiful hike, but I reported<br/>
that the LB is apparently missing. I had printed out clues to several other<br/>
LBs, but there just wasn't enough time! Enjoy your trip.<br/>
