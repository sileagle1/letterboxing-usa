everyone.  =)<br/>
<br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
Wheee... it was great!  I didn't manage to get out till, before <br/>
hitting the road home to Seattle on Sunday afternoon, but I just <br/>
didn't want leave Portland without at least doing one box!<br/>
<br/>
I had printed out several sets of clues before leaving home.  So <br/>
before leaving Portland, I got a Portland map and a bottle of water.  <br/>
I sat in my car pondering the boxes trying to determine which would <br/>
be the easiest/closest.  I decided on "Who let the dogs out"  =D.... <br/>
as it seemed the shortest drive from where I was (Hadden Island?)<br/>
<br/>
I had a little trouble finding the starting point, and crossed the <br/>
Freemont Bridge a couple of times more then necessary.  <blush><br/>
<br/>
It was a great hike.  I was wearing jeans and sneakers and a short <br/>
top with spaghetti straps... Ohhh the bugs LOVED me!  <br/>
<br/>
I started off, not sure what lay ahead of me, but eager to give it my <br/>
best shot.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems that the High Fire Danger sign is no longer there,  but <br/>
the `large clearing' was easy enough to spot.  I learned that I <br/>
wasn't sure what a "snag" was (but knew it when I saw it, thanks to <br/>
the description).  I backtracked to the stump, but I wasn't exactly <br/>
sure where to look.  I was poking around the underbrush, wishing I <br/>
had a walking stick to dig at the leaves... but then all of a sudden, <br/>
I found Skip staring right at me.  =D  <br/>
<br/>
It was so great to find the first box!  I looked over the box at my <br/>
leisure, looking at all the stamps that were already logged, and the <br/>
rest of the boxes' contence and labeling.  <br/>
<br/>
I replaced Skip and continued on.  I found where Rover was supposed <br/>
to be... too bad I missed the little fellow.<br/>
<br/>
I found that I also didn't know what a 'culvert' was (and still don't <br/>
<g>) and I searched around the wrong tree for a few min, having <br/>
misidentified the "reinforcing stick".  But just a little ways up the <br/>
trail I spotted the *correct* stick (no doubt this was the right one <br/>
this time) and found Fido safe and sound.<br/>
<br/>
The trek between Fido and Spot had me huffing a bit, but I was <br/>
determined to get the last box, and was having a fun time to boot!  <br/>
The last jaunt to the tree with 6 trunks was longer then I expected <br/>
and I was concerned that I had missed it or made a wrong turn, but <br/>
again once I saw it I knew I had the right one (great landmarks!).  <br/>
Spot was enjoying the view from his hiding place  as he peeked over a <br/>
chunk of bark that was keeping him slightly camouflaged.  <br/>
<br/>
On this last box, I think the "Mosquito Flight Squad" had found me, <br/>
so I hurried thru this box so I could get on the move again and have <br/>
my hands free for swatting.  =)<br/>
<br/>
I had a blast! ... and a nice little workout to boot.<br/>
<br/>
Everything was in good shape.  The stamps were a little mucky, so I <br/>
cleaned them best I could (by stamping the excess ink goo on the last <br/>
page of my journal numerous times).  The images were very nice and <br/>
stamped very well.  It was great to get my first look at someone <br/>
else's carving work, and see a letterbox 'in the field'.<br/>
<br/>
Already looking forward to my next box!<br/>
