<br/>
  Patapsco Valley State Park McKeldin Area<br/>
  Nearest Town: Marriotsville, MD<br/>
  County: Carroll<br/>
  Date Placed: September 14, 2002<br/>
  Placed by: Psychomommy and The Turtle<br/>
  Clue difficulty: Easy<br/>
  Hike difficulty: Easy, Approx. .7 mile hike<br/>
<br/>
  To reach the McKeldin Area: From 695, take I70 to exit 83 for <br/>
Marriotsville Road. Go North on Marriotsville Road for 4 miles to <br/>
entrance to the park on the right.<br/>
  From I70 East, take Route 40 to Marriotsville Road. Turn left. Park <br/>
is 5 miles on the right.<br/>
  Enter park and drive to entrance gate. Be prepared to pay <br/>
$2.00/person if guard is on duty. Park at the lot ahead. Ask for a <br/>
map ($1.00, I recommend the bought over the xerox copy) <br/>
  From your car, walk back to the gate house and cross the road <br/>
heading towards the sign that says Spring Glen Trail. <br/>
  IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE FIREFLYS' MARYLAND SERIES FIRST I RECOMMEND IT. <br/>
HERS ENDS WHERE OURS BEGIN. OTHERWISE PLEASE CONTINUE. <br/>
  Start at the Spring Glen Trail. <br/>
<br/>
  Box 1<br/>
  BAA BAA BLACK SHEEP<br/>
  From the map board travel along the trail to the first 2 in 1 tree <br/>
on the left. Count 7 blue blazes (only ones facing you). See the <br/>
pines, stop at the first pine. Count 25 steps. See the large curly-q <br/>
snake to the right! Look left. Find the fallen tree that looks like <br/>
driftwood. There you will find #1.<br/>
<br/>
  Box 2<br/>
  SHEEP IN THE MEADOW, COWS IN THE CORN<br/>
  Continue down the trail. Cross 2 speed bumps, STOP! Watch out for <br/>
galloping deer. The stream should be on your left. #3 speed bump - <br/>
There's fungus among us! Keep going!!! Go to the top of the hill. <br/>
Nope it's not here! Walk a little farther look for the tree with the <br/>
knee. Stop. Look right to the cluster of trees. You will find your <br/>
treasure behind the dead one. TIP TOE THRU THE FERNS<br/>
<br/>
  Box 3<br/>
  SHEEP GO TO HEAVEN, GOATS GO TO HELL<br/>
  Continue on the path to the fork in the trail. The Spring Glen is <br/>
your friend. Head for the bottom of the hill. WATCH WHERE THE'RE <br/>
LYING NOT WHERE THE'RE FLYING or you will take a trip. Hop the <br/>
stream, flowing or not. Start counting left blazes only. After the 7 <br/>
blaze look to the right for the old rock wall. Now count 2 right <br/>
blazes. See the hanging extraterrestrials!!!! Go 2 more right blazes. <br/>
STOP Look back to ET and take 6 steps- look right in the middle of 3 <br/>
you will find what you seek.<br/>
  Continue up the hill.<br/>
                          THE END<br/>
