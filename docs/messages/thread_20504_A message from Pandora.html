awhile now, she has asked me to post this for her. These are her words, her<br/>
letter, I am simply posting it for a friend.<br/>
<br/>
Good Evening Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Considering I am no longer a member of the LNBA board let me first say that<br/>
I am asking someone to forward this letter to the board after being<br/>
forwarded the recent threads on LBWORLD because I think I can clear up some<br/>
of what is being said.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First and foremost let me go back and clarify, and answer some peoples<br/>
questions.  What Steve and Heidi say unfortunately is a little misleading<br/>
and leaves out some information.  Randy Hall the owner of this list very<br/>
much took a dictatorship roll.  Several days before Iron`Bear and I were<br/>
removed as moderators Randy Hall wrote all of the moderators and proposed<br/>
that Steve be banned from the list.  The moderators disagreed with Randy for<br/>
several reasons.  I lead the argument against banning Steve based on the<br/>
fact that there was no rule written anywhere as a foundation to ban Steve<br/>
on.  My fellow moderators agreed.  At that point Randy without speaking to<br/>
any of the other moderators, removed Iron`Bear and I as moderators.  First<br/>
Randy told us that we were removed because 5 people had written him asking<br/>
we be removed. Then we were told we were removed because we promoted Steves<br/>
site and the poison it spread.  Immediately after that posts regarding<br/>
Iron`Bear and I being dismissed as moderators were deleted from the list. In<br/>
other words, we were censored.  That censorship and Randys decision to<br/>
dismiss us over this issue is what caused Iron`Bear and I to leave the list.<br/>
Several days after that Steve received an email from Randy Hall that said.<br/>
I've discussed this with my Moderators and you are being banned (removed,<br/>
dropped, cant remember) because of your incessant advertising and the<br/>
content of your website.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now in regards to LBWORLD being hacked; nobody is pointing fingers at anyone<br/>
and saying this person did this.  However it is painfully obvious that this<br/>
is something related to letterboxing and that Steves site is being targeted<br/>
let me explain why we know this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  1.. The first time Steves website was hacked he received email through an<br/>
anonymous email program that read something to the effect of Learn not to<br/>
piss off the wrong people in this hobby.<br/>
  2.. After that and when Iron`Bear and I were working with others to<br/>
organize the Stamp Camp event Steve and I both received anonymous emails<br/>
telling us that we would pay dearly if Steve was not on his best behavior at<br/>
this event because there were rumors that some people that Steve had<br/>
conflicts with might attend.<br/>
  3.. When the website was hacked into this time we knew it was malicious,<br/>
Iron`Bear and Steve and I immediately went to work to get someone<br/>
technically capable of figuring out what happened working on the job.<br/>
Iron`Bear and I pulled some strings with old FBI friends of his, hired an<br/>
attorney in case we ended up needing one, and Steve had some extra help this<br/>
time because he was able to take the hard drive into work (He words Security<br/>
at a VERY well known computer company) and have them look at it.  This time,<br/>
the hard drive was fried, the backup files of the site were corrupted with<br/>
viruses and in the directory structure of the hard drive a message was left<br/>
that read and I quote home/we/were/here/first in addition to that script<br/>
messages were left as well that read There can be only one<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is not hard to figure out that someone out there involved in this hobby,<br/>
is targeting the LBAWORLD website and the people that run it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now in regards to the LBPNW list: And this may very well get me removed from<br/>
the list.  But I personally spoke with Ryan about this and what Ryan says is<br/>
very true.  Steve did leave the list on his own the first time, and when he<br/>
tried to come back he was told that he was not welcome there, that he had<br/>
his play ground and Ryan had his.  I told Ryan personally that I felt this<br/>
was a dictatorship role.  I dont think LBPNW is Ryans playground, I think<br/>
its a community, and him deciding to outcast someone from it for his own<br/>
personal reasons I think is completely out of line.  However, Ryan owns the<br/>
list, he can do what he wants, and if we dont like it, we can leave, as<br/>
Ryan told me when I spoke to him about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The concept that Steve and LBWORLD are dividers is absolutely incorrect.<br/>
That is the opinion of a select few that want it that way.  As much as Ryan<br/>
and others may say publicly that they do not want this community divided,<br/>
not letting Steve re-join, and telling me personally that events hosted by<br/>
the LBWORLD website cannot be advertised on the LBPNW board speak volumes of<br/>
the togetherness that Ryan is trying to achieve.  I like Ryan very much, he<br/>
and I talk often, but Im sorry, this is my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In regards to this LBNA list being peaceful and the community being together<br/>
before Steve came along, Im sorry that could not be farther from the truth.<br/>
Go through the archives and you can see that for yourselves.  This hobby has<br/>
been divided more than once. There are still some people around here that<br/>
were here when it all began, ask Der Mad Stamp, Randy Hall, Susan Davis, if<br/>
this was always peaceful and always a united community.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All that said let me conclude my informative diatribe with a heartfelt<br/>
message.  When I left this list I made a final post saying that my being<br/>
removed as a moderator and my leaving the list was no big deal, to let it<br/>
go, that the list didnt need to argue over it, that was what I had always<br/>
tried to stop as a moderator, the arguing and the flame wars.  I still feel<br/>
that way my fellow letterboxers.  While I will not sit by idly and watch<br/>
while those that try to support and defend me are slapped around for doing<br/>
so, I honestly do not wish arguments on the LBNA list or any other list for<br/>
that matter that focus on LBWORLD or the people that run it. I know that<br/>
Iron`Bear and Steve and Kris of Team Rayvenhaus agree with me completely.  I<br/>
ask you all, please let it go, let it die, we want a peaceful happy place,<br/>
if you want to be a part of that with us you know where to find us, and<br/>
there is no reason to argue about us or our website, it does none of us any<br/>
good, in fact, the truth is my friends, and enemies, the more attention you<br/>
give to what happened the more you encourage someone to try and do it again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well and much happiness,<br/>
<br/>
Pandora<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; The concept that Steve and LBWORLD are dividers is absolutely<br/>
&gt; incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
When the first person on LbNA took all their boxes off from LbNA, <br/>
unsubscribed from the talk list, and moved over to Steve's website, <br/>
he became a divider.  It became an us vs. them.<br/>
<br/>
You may not see it that way, but Steve, I believe, is the seed that's <br/>
splitting letterboxing.  There are other contributing factors, but <br/>
the root cause, I firmly believe, is Steve.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody has denied there have been arguments in the past--but I've <br/>
never seen them morph into a permanent rift in the letterboxing <br/>
community.<br/>
<br/>
And as personal as you think my decision was to not allow Steve not <br/>
to post to the Pacific Northwest board (*not* banned, though it's <br/>
mostly semantics), it was also my belief that he's an unstable <br/>
influence that would cause the board to deteriorate, and it's my job <br/>
as a moderator to stop that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
If you call that censorship, so be it. Technically, any board that <br/>
requires a moderator is censorship--just knowing there are moderators <br/>
on the board who could nuke your post or ban you will make one think <br/>
twice about what to post.  So please don't post about 'censorship' <br/>
with such a broad stroke--especially when WoL suffers the same fate.  <br/>
I know I certainly wouldn't feel welcome there, thus, I am being <br/>
censored.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Now in regards to the LBPNW list: And this may very well get me<br/>
&gt; removed from the list.<br/>
<br/>
I don't remove people who disagree with me.  Disagreements and <br/>
discussions are generally healthy.  They sort out misunderstandings <br/>
and allow us to get on with life.  I respect someone's right to <br/>
disagree, but I will also do my best to help protect the LbNA <br/>
community that has given so much to me.<br/>
