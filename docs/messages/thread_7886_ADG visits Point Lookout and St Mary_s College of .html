St. Mary's.  Saturday evening, we drove down to the waterfront and <br/>
watched the orange harvest moon rise over the Chesapeake Bay.  It was <br/>
an absolutely gorgeous sight.<br/>
<br/>
We got eaten alive by the mosquitos, but we did manage to place 2 <br/>
boxes and a hitcher.  I am a little too pooped to post them now, so <br/>
expect them tomorrow afternoon.  I hope all of you boxers had at <br/>
least as much fun as we did this weekend!<br/>
