Memorial Day?... Nah that's boring.<br/>
<br/>
Let's see:<br/>
April is National Welding Month.. it's also International Guitar month... could be a theme in <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Specific Days?  I'll move to the middle of the month to give you time to carve!<br/>
April 12: Reach as High as You Can Day<br/>
April 13: Blame Somebody Else Day<br/>
April 22: National Jellybean Day (and incidentally near and dear to my heart.. it's Girl Scout <br/>
Leader Appreciation Day)<br/>
April 30: Hairstyle Appreciation Day<br/>
<br/>
and even though it may be too soon to carve, I couldn't bear to leave out...<br/>
<br/>
March 20: Extraterrestrial Abductions Day (I can see the stamp in my head!!)<br/>
