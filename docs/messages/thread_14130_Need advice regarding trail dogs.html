dogs.<br/>
<br/>
When a dog jumps on you a good trick is to put a knee out towards <br/>
their chest as they jump up. It is quite effective in knocking them <br/>
back and is what some trainers teach you to do to teach your own dog <br/>
not to jump up on people. This assumes the dog is jumping to play <br/>
with/greet you. It may not be wise if the dog is acting particularly <br/>
agressive or vicious.<br/>
<br/>
I find that ignoring the dog and just walking by without eye contact <br/>
usually works well, esp. if the dog is just barking at you and <br/>
nothing else.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As letterboxers who ALWAYS have a dog with us, we appreciate your <br/>
comments and concerns.  Madras was attacked at Devils Hopyard 2 years <br/>
ago and I would up having to put a bootmark on the offending dog to <br/>
get him to let up. <br/>
<br/>
When we were stamping into Resolution at Rocky Neck, we were sitting <br/>
on the ledge and 4 dogs (all off leash) along with 2 irresponsible <br/>
ladies came up the trail...the dogs seeing Maddie and immediately <br/>
coming at us at full gallup. I had to let out a very loud, deep, "Get <br/>
outta here" just to get them to break stride. Had heidi hold madras <br/>
while I shooed them away.  <br/>
<br/>
All in all, we keep Madras on leash except for rare circumstances. <br/>
Those would be letting her swim and hiking on a trail that we are <br/>
SURE no one else is on.  Example would be Oriental Medicine in <br/>
Nehantic SF...where there's one entrance way off the road and it is <br/>
obvious that no one else is up there.  <br/>
<br/>
Boiling this slop down to a point... dogs on leash in areas where <br/>
other hikers frequent is a must.   I know for a fact that my dog <br/>
won't bite and she's likely to lick you to death, but it's not about <br/>
my knowledge... its about a piece of mind for the hiker that we <br/>
encounter in the woods.   <br/>
<br/>
As far as dog treats, we've always got some in a pocket or a pack.  <br/>
Have not had critter problems at boxes yet.  I'd suggest a stern <br/>
shout at an approaching dog.... the knee to the chest works well if <br/>
they jump... and when in doubt "Walk softly and carry a big stick" as <br/>
they say.  <br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">As a dog owner and trainer/behaviorist, I am always compelled to try and<br/>
educate those I come upon on trails with less than perfect manners. Of<br/>
course, I frequently have my dogs with me, so it is easier to start up dog<br/>
conversations with people than it would be for people without dogs in tow. I<br/>
have on many occasions read people the riot act so to speak because their<br/>
lack of responsibility directly impacts my ability to go places and do fun<br/>
things with my dogs. I explain that because of people not keeping dogs on<br/>
leash and cleaning up after their pets, many parks and other once dog<br/>
friendly places are changing their regulations to make pets not welcome.<br/>
Further, I explain that by having their dog off leash they are risking the<br/>
health and safety of their pet, as well as potentially causing a law suit<br/>
for themselves if the dog causes problems for other park visitors or wild<br/>
life. Of course some people roll their eyes and think you are some fruit,<br/>
but most really do appreciate you pointing out potential situations. LOL...<br/>
I have even given poop bags to people I caught letting their dogs defecate<br/>
without cleaning it up. The funny look on their face is worth the effort as<br/>
I say " Oh you must have forgotten your clean up bag, here I have an extra"<br/>
and hand it to them without even blinking.... as I point out the location of<br/>
the closest trash can.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I have also taken mental descriptions of people and their<br/>
dogs and made more than my fair share of reports to rangers and other park<br/>
employees. I figure if my lecture didn't work, having a park person explain<br/>
that they need to get their dog on a leash or leave ASAP just might have the<br/>
desired effect. I also take the time to explain to the park person that I<br/>
myself have dogs and appreciate the ability to bring them into parks and<br/>
other areas and that because of that, I hate to see people abuse the<br/>
privilege by breaking the rules and becoming a nuisance. Usually they<br/>
respond very favorably and appreciate you taking the time to talk with them.<br/>
<br/>
SO, to specifically deal with a dog issue on the trail, some tips:<br/>
<br/>
1) If you a dog coming at you on the trail stop and avoid direct eye contact<br/>
with the dog. Usually you stopping gives the dog's owner some time to get<br/>
the dog under control, if they don't appear to be doing anything, or say "<br/>
Oh he/she loves people."  Say " Would you please get your dog under control<br/>
on a leash. The park rules state your dog must be on a leash."<br/>
<br/>
2) If the dog acts aggressive or barks, stay standing very still and try<br/>
talking to the dog with a friendly tone like "Hey buddy what are you up to"<br/>
or some other phrase. If you try yelling, shooing, or waving your arms, the<br/>
dog may take the act as threatening and decide to increase his/her<br/>
aggression toward you. Along the same line, NEVER WAVE A STICK OR TRY TO ACT<br/>
THREATENING. Some dogs may be intimidated , but then again it may very well<br/>
instigate a full out attack. ( In temperament testing one of the ways they<br/>
test a dog's protective nature is have a person come at the dog waving a<br/>
stick and acting threatening. This exact behavior can illicit an aggressive<br/>
attack in even the most docile acting dogs because it is a direct threat<br/>
upon them and causes their fight or flight mode to kick in.)<br/>
<br/>
3) Once the person does have the dog under control mention in passing that<br/>
the dog should really be on a leash given the rules of the park and the<br/>
number of people out on the trail. If the dog acted aggressively toward you<br/>
tell the owner that the dog is exhibiting the potential for a really bad<br/>
situation and that if the dog injures someone or wildlife that the owner<br/>
could be sued for negligence, as well as fined for having the dog off a<br/>
leash. ( In passing you can also mention that you are an attorney...LOL)<br/>
<br/>
4) If you pass park personnel mention to them that you had an altercation<br/>
with a dog running off leash and be prepared to give them a description of<br/>
the people and the dog.<br/>
<br/>
5) If you are ever harmed by a loose dog be sure and report it IMMEDIATELY<br/>
and be sure to follow up with a bite report. ( In all bite situations the<br/>
dog's owner needs to provide proof that the dog is current on Rabies<br/>
vaccines and in some cases, the owner must have the dog under quarantine for<br/>
10 days.) Tell the owner directly that you were bitten or injured. People<br/>
with dogs that bite or cause problems need to be held accountable for their<br/>
actions and dogs with problems need to be identified. If you don't report<br/>
it, the next person the dog attacks might be more seriously injured, or<br/>
worse it might be someone's child.<br/>
<br/>
6) If all else fails, use the mace to deter the dog. If the owner gets upset<br/>
remind them that the park rules state that dogs must be on a leash and under<br/>
control and that their dog was not. The key phrase is " I felt my life was<br/>
in danger because the dog was acting aggressively and was running out of<br/>
control off leash." I can recount several situations where dogs have been<br/>
shot by park personnel for exactly that reason.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is one of my HUGEST pet peeves as a former dog trainer and an owner of a <br/>
dog that is aggressive toward other dogs. I cannot stand when dog owners <br/>
don't curb their dogs. <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion as a trainer, you should not allow your dog to go near anyone <br/>
unless they ask you if they may pet your dog and you agree that it is okay. <br/>
Some people are frightened of dogs (there's nothing quite like sending a <br/>
dog-phobic person into a tearful hysteria!) and others are allergic or simply don't <br/>
like animals. Don't assume the world is eager to meet your four-legged friend. <br/>
Don't impose your dog on your fellow hikers.<br/>
<br/>
I always step to the side and give others the right of way when we have Nina <br/>
with us, and I always call her to a 'heel' position when there are on-coming <br/>
people on a trail or path. <br/>
<br/>
I can't tell you how many times I've shouted at people at a distance to leash <br/>
their loose dog as their dog begins to gallop toward my dog. So often the <br/>
response is, "Oh, he's friendly!" to which I am forced to respond,"Yes, but MY <br/>
dog will EAT your dog!"  Then THEY look all horrified like they never imagined <br/>
that there would actually be someone or some dog that wouldn't want to meet <br/>
their dog in all its jumping, slobbering glory. Then they are surprised when my <br/>
leashed (trapped) dog growls and snaps at their loose dog as it jumps all over <br/>
the place. Sometimes I have had to hold off their dog and control my dog <br/>
simultaneously until they bother to pull their dog off. It just frosts me! <br/>
<br/>
So here's my opinion. A sharp knee to the chest and a loud "NO!" or "OFF!" is <br/>
quite appropriate and will not hurt the dog (don't be gentle - you want to <br/>
knock the steam out of him/her and you want to make it clear that it would not <br/>
be fun to jump on you again). <br/>
<br/>
I would not carry treats with you as you may find yourself being overwhelmed <br/>
by a dog that is ill-mannered. I have seen untrained dogs practically go into <br/>
people's mouths looking to take food from them.<br/>
<br/>
I used to think that carrying pepper spray would be a good solution, but <br/>
having the recent experience with Nina being chewed up by that german shepard, I <br/>
realized that in the heat of the moment I would be hard pressed to spray a <br/>
dog... realistically. It would be really hard to do it and not hit a person in the <br/>
process, and it would break my heart to spray them.<br/>
<br/>
If a dog nips you, you should shout quite loudly, "OW! HE BIT ME!" That <br/>
should get owners to sit up and take notice. It is unfortunate that the only thing <br/>
that some people respond to is the reminder that they are legally liable for <br/>
any damage their dog causes. In every class I would teach, the first thing I <br/>
would remind people of is that they are responsible for their dog's actions. In <br/>
this day and age of litigious  craziness, your dog doesn't have to bite or <br/>
physically hurt someone to cause a lawsuit. All your dog has to do is be present <br/>
and frighten someone and they could be calling you into a courtroom.<br/>
<br/>
Your first thought should be of your own comfort and safety. Don't be afraid <br/>
of reminding people of leash laws or of informing them of your particular <br/>
needs. They may roll their eyes and be obnoxious about it, but they also may truly <br/>
have never thought of what COULD happen. You'd be surprised.<br/>
<br/>
(sorry to rant, but it's a particularly sore spot for me...and poor Nina - <br/>
Her fur has not grown completely back yet.)<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing! <br/>

However, once you give a wandering dog a biscuit, you will have a hard time getting rid of it. A walking stick is a good idea, not to "whack the living crap out of them", but to use as more of a prod or lever between you and the dog. I give plenty of people dirty looks when their dog runs up to me waaay before they get close, but it seems that some people never learn, or they have the "rules are for other people" mentality. Dogs should be kept on leashes unless they are trained to heel at all times. You never know when you will run into someone with an intense dislike or fear of dogs, not to mention what dangerous things your dog could run into. Better safe then sorry!<br/>

my evil letterboxing devil on my left shoullder chimed in "Just carry <br/>
a huge mahogany walking stick and whack the living crap out of them."<br/>
<br/>
So, I plead with the letterboxing community - help!  What is the best <br/>
remedy to this situation?<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too, have been in your situation, but the situation differs when you have<br/>
your own dogs as the focus of the interests of someone's out of control dog.<br/>
If you are an individual without dogs and the dog is acting aggressively<br/>
toward you, the last thing you want to do is act aggressive. It can and does<br/>
cause the intensity of the situation to heighten and can cause you to get<br/>
severely bitten. ( I actually witnessed this when I was ski-jouring with my<br/>
Rottweiler one winter. My dog was in harness 5 feet in front of me and<br/>
attached to my waist when I came upon a man cross country skiing toward me<br/>
on the same trail. The man's immediate response was to raise a ski pole and<br/>
act aggressive toward my dog and she started to go for him to protect<br/>
herself and me. I yelled at him to stand still and talk to her and she<br/>
immediately stopped reacting when he calmed down. Once he acted normal she<br/>
started wiggling her whole body and approached him for petting. After the<br/>
incident I explained why she reacted to his actions and how he should<br/>
approach a strange dog given the same situation and he agreed)<br/>
<br/>
In my own case with my dogs ( I have 5), the best solution is to remain calm<br/>
and have you own dog(s) on a loose leash. If you tighten their leash and try<br/>
to restrain them, often times the dog tenses up and tends to strain forward<br/>
putting up his/her defenses. That combined with having a strange dog<br/>
charging up at them, can cause an immediate altercation where, often times,<br/>
when everyone is relaxed about it, the dogs sort of sniff each other and<br/>
diffuse the situation themselves. The key is to remain calm, so the dogs<br/>
remain calm.<br/>
<br/>
If the above doesn't work, or if you are like myself and have a dog that<br/>
doesn't like other dogs rushing up, then I try to still keep a loose leash<br/>
and tell the dog to get back, hopefully awakening the mind of the other<br/>
dog's owner. I will also try and place myself between my dog an the out of<br/>
control dog to try and keep some separation between dogs. ( If you dog is<br/>
small enough you can also pick the dog up to maintain distance) If things do<br/>
resort to an all out dog fight then at that point you do whatever you have<br/>
do to break things up. DO NOT attempt to put your hands on any dogs, but<br/>
rather try to get a big stick and start knocking heads. Of course, when your<br/>
own dog is on leash  it helps keep some control of the situation as you have<br/>
somewhat of a handle on one of the parties. At that point if I had pepper<br/>
spray, I would use it!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, once the incident is over and hopefully all is well, I take the<br/>
opportunity to mention the potential situation that could have occurred and<br/>
the bodily harm that could have come to the off leash dog. It is pretty easy<br/>
to point out that my 5 could have quite literally killed the other dog<br/>
because of pack mentality and that there are reasons why parks require dogs<br/>
be on leash. I also mention that one of my dogs is aggressive toward other<br/>
dogs running at her and that I really don't appreciate the other person's<br/>
carelessness.  If there was a dog fight then I say similar things, but with<br/>
more intensity and probably poorer language. Also, I ask for the person's<br/>
address and phone number because of their legal responsibilities since their<br/>
dog was breaking the rules by being off leash. I don't say that when asking<br/>
for the information, but rather I say I would like to exchange Rabies<br/>
vaccination information in case of a problem. I also take a description of<br/>
the people, dog, etc., and explain the incident to the park officials, being<br/>
sure to mention that the other dog was off leash. It never hurts to protect<br/>
yourself.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>

&gt; As letterboxers who ALWAYS have a dog with us, we appreciate your<br/>
&gt; comments and concerns.  Madras was attacked at Devils Hopyard 2 years<br/>
&gt; ago and I would up having to put a bootmark on the offending dog to<br/>
&gt; get him to let up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When we were stamping into Resolution at Rocky Neck, we were sitting<br/>
&gt; on the ledge and 4 dogs (all off leash) along with 2 irresponsible<br/>
&gt; ladies came up the trail...the dogs seeing Maddie and immediately<br/>
&gt; coming at us at full gallup. I had to let out a very loud, deep, "Get<br/>
&gt; outta here" just to get them to break stride. Had heidi hold madras<br/>
&gt; while I shooed them away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All in all, we keep Madras on leash except for rare circumstances.<br/>
&gt; Those would be letting her swim and hiking on a trail that we are<br/>
&gt; SURE no one else is on.  Example would be Oriental Medicine in<br/>
&gt; Nehantic SF...where there's one entrance way off the road and it is<br/>
&gt; obvious that no one else is up there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boiling this slop down to a point... dogs on leash in areas where<br/>
&gt; other hikers frequent is a must.   I know for a fact that my dog<br/>
&gt; won't bite and she's likely to lick you to death, but it's not about<br/>
&gt; my knowledge... its about a piece of mind for the hiker that we<br/>
&gt; encounter in the woods.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as dog treats, we've always got some in a pocket or a pack.<br/>
&gt; Have not had critter problems at boxes yet.  I'd suggest a stern<br/>
&gt; shout at an approaching dog.... the knee to the chest works well if<br/>
&gt; they jump... and when in doubt "Walk softly and carry a big stick" as<br/>
&gt; they say.<br/>

This is a huge pet peeve of mine! I usually box with our coonhound,<br/>
Bonnie, and she is ALWAYS on leash. But FYI, if you come to box in<br/>
Richmond, VA, I have never in my life seen an entire community refuse<br/>
to leash its dogs when its humans visit parks! Every single time<br/>
Bonnie and I go to a Richmond-area park to box or to walk around, we<br/>
are accosted by unleashed dogs. Because we live in Richmond, it's a<br/>
big concern.<br/>
<br/>
I have started carrying a walking stick and citronella spray for this<br/>
reason. The citronella spray is effective on almost all animals, even<br/>
snakes, but can't harm humans if the wind sprays some back in your<br/>
face after you've sprayed it.<br/>
<br/>
The human companions of these unleashed dogs are the real problems<br/>
here. I haven't reported anyone yet, nor have I reminded these people<br/>
that the park's signs say that all dogs have to be leashed. I'm not<br/>
interested in any drama, I guess. But I have on a couple of occasions<br/>
shouted at the humans who were not close to their dogs at all when<br/>
their dogs came galloping up to us to come get their dogs. Rarely do<br/>
they put their dogs on leashes at this point; they usually just grab<br/>
the dog by the collar and drag it farther down the trail from us, then<br/>
let it go.<br/>
<br/>
The only time I have gotten really irate occurred at Dorey Park, where<br/>
some of the Clue series boxes are hidden. A group of young men were<br/>
discgolfing, and they were approaching us on the trail. Suddenly a<br/>
young male Rottie came out of nowhere and ran up to Bonnie and<br/>
literally shoved its snout under her stomach to smell her. I put my<br/>
stick in between the two and sorta pushed against him, but he didn't<br/>
back off much. He was just smelling away. Bonnie was standing very<br/>
still. Just then one of the young men left his group and came over,<br/>
calling the dog by name and telling it to come to him, but of course<br/>
it didn't respond. So I told the boy in no-uncertain terms to get his<br/>
dog off my dog immediately and that didn't he realize there were leash<br/>
laws in this park? He had to pull the dog away with by its collar, and<br/>
he basically ignored me. As usual, he let the Rottie go once he was<br/>
about 10 yards away. This schmuck I would have gladly reported but<br/>
most Richmond parks don't have staff on site.<br/>

Well - I can give you my advice. (I do national animal welfare for a <br/>
living, if that makes a difference)  <br/>
<br/>
At National Parks, dogs are REQUIRED to be on a 6' leash or shorter. <br/>
National Forests also have rules regarding pets - though these can be <br/>
interpreted a bit more loosely - check with the ranger.<br/>
<br/>
Your State Parks and Open Spaces may have different rules, you can <br/>
check with your Park Ranger and you should report folks on the trails <br/>
that are in violation.  I can't remember what state you were in, so <br/>
taking a wild stab, I checked CT.  CT State Parks and Forests require <br/>
dogs to be on a leash, too.  (if you're not in CT, email me and I'll <br/>
check the regs for you for other states)<br/>
<br/>
As for carrying mace, etc.  Your suggestion of carrying a big stick <br/>
was right on the money.  No ... I'm not suggesting that you "whack <br/>
the living crap out of them" - but you CAN use the stick to keep the <br/>
dog at bay - and to put some distance between you and the dog.  <br/>
<br/>
This can often buy you enough time to alert the dog's owner who <br/>
should be in control of the animal to begin with.  <br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong, I love to see dogs on trails, but only off-leash <br/>
if its allowed, and if the dog is NOT aggressive.  Many, many folks <br/>
think their dog is not a problem until it is too late and their <br/>
animal has bitten someone.  I get LOTS of calls every day like that.  <br/>
Always better to be safe, for both the dog and the other hikers out <br/>
there.<br/>

I have held off on jumping into this discussion, but it's an important one. See, I have two small toy poodles. One (a cream colored 5 year old) weighs in at just under 5 pounds, the other (her mother, a black 10 1/2 year old) at almost 8 pounds. They are incredibly well-behaved dogs, a mother and daughter who have never been apart for more than a few hours. Molly (the mother) is rather protective of Annie, and though neither has any hesitation about running up to anyone and rolling over for a bellyrub, if Molly suspects that anything bad is happening to Annie, she will get defensive. Any attempt to pat her while she is in this mode will result in a nip. Not a hard bite, but a nip that usually will break a cuticle.<br/>
<br/>
Also, neither dog has any problem with bigger dogs (which are often scared of them!), and unfortunately, like most small dogs, they do not seem to realize their own size. If a large dog comes up to them, they will hold their ground just as stubbornly as a trained German shepherd. Thankfully they are small enough that I am always able to sweep them both up in my arms if another dog approches, but I am then left with no free hand with which to hold back the approaching dog from jumping up on me in an attempt to investigate my dogs.<br/>
<br/>
I always have both of them on a leash (unless they are being carried!), but as I just said, there is nothing I can do about other dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, this whole subject is somewhat "preaching to the choir", since we are all good about controlling our own dogs, but I thought that I'd put in my two cents.<br/>

I think everyone covered this topic well. I'm behind in reading my mail, but thought I'd pass along my tips. I teach Bite Prevention to kids and will soon be teaching groups of adults that go into homes (social workers, home care nurses, etc.). <br/>
<br/>
Never run or make quick moves! Keep in mind that threatening a dog is likely to get you bitten. Even friendly dogs will feel the need to defend themselves from a threat.<br/>
<br/>
#1. If approached by a loose dog... STOP and stand still with your side to the dog (less threatening than a full front presentation).<br/>
#2 Don't make eye contact. Direct eye contact is a threat to a dog. They learn from humans that we like to look them in the eye and that it's OK, but if a dog is frightened, they will revert to what comes naturally over what they have been taught. A dog might look aggressive, but many aggressive displays are fear based.<br/>
#3 Talk quietly in a normal tone of voice to the dog (unless you think your voice will be shaky). Dogs don't understand most of our words, but they do learn to recognize our tone of voice as friendly or threatening. Try to keep your tone neutral or friendly toward the owner (at least until they get the dog under control :-)<br/>
#4 Keep your hands in your pockets or at your side. If you hold your hands up away from the dog, they may jump up on you to see what you are 'hiding' in your hands. An option that I give kids is to cover their faces with their open hands. This keeps the dog from licking their face (or nipping it) and keeps the big bones of their forearms in front of their necks. If you have a bag or backpack, you can hold it between you and the dog as you back away slowly.<br/>
#5 If the dog jumps on you in a friendly way, raising your knee will keep his claws away from your body, but you don't need to raise your knee violently with intent to hit the dog. If you hurt the dog with your knee, they might bite. You can also try turning away from the dog, but there is a possibility that the dog will put it's paws up on your back and leave claw marks if they are really boisterous.<br/>
#6 If a dog is rushing at you and you feel it's menacing... turn your side to the dog, look down (not at the dog) and in your deepest, loudest "I'm gonna kill you if you don't stop" voice yell "NO!" when the dog is about 5 feet away. This advice is from a professional 'decoy' (the person that wears the bite suit for attack trained dogs). This is not recommended for children because their voices tend to sound too high pitched to be effective.<br/>
<br/>
There is additional advice I could give to children, and to people who would be entering a dog's territory. I think previous posts covered the situation involving two (or more) dogs meeting fairly well.<br/>
<br/>
Most dogs just want to come "say hi" and will do no harm if you are not a threat to them. Once they sniff you, they are content to leave you alone. If no owner is around, either stand still till the dog gets bored of you and leaves, or if the dog won't leave, back away slowly while avoiding eye contact. <br/>
I am not saying that it's OK for people to let their dogs run loose! There are so many reasons why it's dangerous and not the educated thing to do. I agree with what Shiela said about educating the dog's owner about the legal ramifications of their choice to disregard the rules. Even if a park does not have rules posted, most cities have leash laws on the books that would apply.  <br/>

Subject: Need advice regarding trail dogs<br/>
<br/>
Having hit the trails with wild abandon this last week, I have come <br/>
across a situation for which I need advice.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of dogs with people on the trails.  Most of the time, <br/>
the dog owners are quite responsible with their dogs, but I have <br/>
discovered that other owners have not yet acquired that skill.  I <br/>
have been jumped upon, barked at furiously, and actually nipped.<br/>
<br/>
My first thought was to carry dog biscuits with me to calm these non-<br/>
attended dogs (I also carry mace and a quite large auto-release <br/>
knife), but then my good letterboxing angel on my right shoulder <br/>
said "No, no, you will carry the scent of the dog biscuits to the <br/>
letterbox.  Critters will follow the scent and ravage the box."  Then <br/>
my evil letterboxing devil on my left shoullder chimed in "Just carry <br/>
a huge mahogany walking stick and whack the living crap out of them."<br/>
<br/>
So, I plead with the letterboxing community - help!  What is the best <br/>
remedy to this situation?<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to constructive advice (and not a flamewar),<br/>
<br/>
