I am new to LB in RI but not stamp carving.  I have fallen in love with this <br/>
new hobby/sport (not sure exactly how to refer to it).  I went to Mark &amp; Sue's <br/>
website and was so impressed by all of the info and just everything about it! <br/>
 I would like to thank you as it will be very helpful to me!  And I can't <br/>
wait til the Monster Mash!!<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to letterboxing.  There are lots of us now in RI.  When I <br/>
started the only boxers we would get in RI at our boxes were those <br/>
that would cross over from CT.  Be sure to check out the New England <br/>
talkgroup also.<br/>
