You're SO RIGHT!!!  Mt. Tabor is there.  If it's not obvious I'm oblivious.<br/>
Wayne went up to Mt. Tabor Sunday and found it AND A HITCHHIKER!!!  I was<br/>
kicking myself!!!  We won't hear the end of that for a while, I can assure<br/>
you. No one's ever accused me of being the sharpest tack in the box, that's<br/>
for sure, but at least I'm fun!  Anyway...After way too much thorough study,<br/>
further  investigation and most of all confirmation, John and I FINALLY got<br/>
a clue!  I guess I'd practically have had to be hit upside the head with a<br/>
stick to figure it out.  IT WAS THERE THE WHOLE TIME.  ARGHHHH!  Very<br/>
clever, Mitch!  And, as Wayne said, that is completely classic!  SUPERB, my<br/>
friend.  <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

<br/>
Once we found it I was really wondering if I had a brain at all. I should<br/>
have known that Master Mitch wouldn't make it TOO EASY for me.  I felt so<br/>
stupid!  Especially after actually phoning you up, swearing it wasn't there!<br/>
I hope I wasn't too pesky. At least I was right about Wahkeenah. It was<br/>
great talking to you, by the way and great to have confirmation of the<br/>
missing boxes and those still there.  Now I'm really wanting to get up to<br/>
Multnomah Falls now that I know it's up there. It's great to know!<br/>
<br/>
I think there might be a few people out this weekend playing dog catcher in<br/>
Forest Park.  My pups will be so happy!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Also...Be aware.  This letterboxing bug has bitten many people now and you<br/>
can be sure things will be hopping in Oregon and Washington some more in the<br/>
near future, just wait and see.  Everyone I talk to is getting excited about<br/>
it and say they never heard of it.  I tell anyone who's willing to listen.<br/>
<br/>
