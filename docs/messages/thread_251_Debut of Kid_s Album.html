BTW, Mitch, I LOVE the notebook background.  You are really a super web-master.  I just started trying my own hand at this--my preliminary efforts are only a testament to the power of good wizards (the software kind, not fantastic creatures like the Moorland Wiz)!  Someday, maybe I will master HTML!<br/>

This is such a marvelous diversion from my rather oppressive duty this weekend: finishing up a project proposal that was suddenly thrown my way last weekend.  Two days and it's out.  Things are looking pretty good right now, so Rick and I are planning to plant that box this weekend--so tune back in to my site again!<br/>
<br/>
Hasta,<br/>
