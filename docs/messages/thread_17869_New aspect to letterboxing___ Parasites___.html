think it would be fun to see all the "infected" stamps.  Go for it <br/>
Leaping Lizards!  I'm relatively new to this this hobby, sport, game, <br/>
what ever title we wish to give it, and as I've come to understand <br/>
there "are no rules."  So why not let this idea have a shot?  If you <br/>
don't want to participate and should stumble upon a parasite, just <br/>
leave it in the box.<br/>
<br/>
And the issue about the name, well 1) from what I've learned parasite <br/>
is not the common term in the US for finding additional stamps. Okay, <br/>
so they've been referred to as parasites at times, but they seem to <br/>
be <br/>
more commonly known as hitch hikers. 2) I don't see what the big deal <br/>
is about using the term parasite.  I don't see how it would initiate <br/>
fear or confusion. If that's the case, I suppose we best change the <br/>
term "hitchkiker" to something more pc, and so that any letterboxers--<br/>
<br/>
adults or children-- don't think we are actually picking up a <br/>
hitchhiker. I have a suggestion-- how about homeless stamps-- wait, <br/>
that wouldn't be pc either . . . minimally sheltered stamp??? <br/>
Freeloader?  Isn't there a list for hitchhikers?  Maybe it should be <br/>
changed to the traveling companion list?  Sound ridiculous?  So does <br/>
the nit-picking over this idea (no pun intended).  It's a game.  <br/>
There <br/>
are no rules.  Cuckoo clues and Hitchhikers were once ideas, too, and <br/>
probably not popular with everyone at the beginning, either.  But <br/>
hey, <br/>
you've got to try new things.  <br/>
<br/>
I say, give it a try.  I can't wait to be infected<br/>
