                    <div class="plaintext-content">The vinegar method will smudge. When I experimented on<br/>
white plastic erasers and pink carving medium, the<br/>
glossier the medium, the more it smudged. Letting the<br/>
transferred image dry completely for a few hours,<br/>
thereby curing it, seemed to help. Also, in response<br/>
to Leger De Maine's issue of the paper disintegrating,<br/>
I dabbed rather than rubbed plain old copy paper with<br/>
the inkjet image face down with a cotton ball<br/>
saturated in vinegar. Perhaps card stock might work<br/>
better? I will also try Leger De Maine's suggestion to<br/>
wet the carving medium with vinegar, applythe image<br/>
and press. That sounds like a workable solution as<br/>
well. <br/>
<br/>
I am wondering what other readlily available liquids,<br/>
both solvent and non-solvent based, might work and<br/>
leave a more permanent image that won't smudge. Any<br/>
chem majors out there who have insight?<br/>
<br/>
I also wonder if there is a way to de-gloss the medium<br/>
without eating it up so as to make it more receptive<br/>
and less likely to smudge. My sense is that the<br/>
glossing is more likely due to the<br/>
manufacturing/cutting/curing process and not a coating<br/>
applied to make the medium more attractive in its<br/>
finished state. <br/>
<br/>
I sent a message to April who owns Stampeaz here in<br/>
Connecticut and who does very intricate carvings and<br/>
is always most helpful. I asked her if she would be<br/>
willing to share her technique(s)for transfering her<br/>
images to the carving medium. When she responds, I<br/>
will post here. <br/>
<br/>
As an aside, I am writing from my other "home" near<br/>
Ithaca NY. Found the Sapsucker Woods (Cornell<br/>
Labratory of Ornithology) and Cornell Plantations<br/>
Letterboxes yesterday. The Plantations are lush and<br/>
green and full of color right now. Both places are<br/>
gems...even without letterboxes to find...and well<br/>
worth a side trip.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great weekend all.<br/>

&gt; Nah, not the only one.  I tried the acetone transfer<br/>
&gt; method and really didn't have good results.  My best<br/>
&gt; results come with the good ole graphite transfer- I<br/>
&gt; use a graphite art pencil rather than a regular one<br/>
&gt; for darker lines.  So far so good, although one must<br/>
&gt; be careful not to smudge the image.  I'm thinking of<br/>
&gt; trying the vinegar method- is there smudging with<br/>
&gt; that?<br/>

&gt; &gt; gee, am I the only one still using tracing paper? <br/>
&gt; &gt; no chemicals for <br/>
&gt; &gt; me and works like a charm.  I feel so old fashion!<br/>
