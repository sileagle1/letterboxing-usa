My sister dropped us off at Harpers Ferry along with Ryan.  Ryan took off northbound and we headed south.  We walked from HF to Keys Gap where we had left our vehicle.  We passed 7 thru hikers (one with a dog), 7 day hikers, numerous chipmonks,&amp; birds, we saw 3 deer and one tick each.  The weirdest part was crossing the power lines and listening to them crackle.  I had never heard that before and it was pretty spooky!<br/>
We both felt great at the end and can't wait to continue.<br/>
Thanks to Green Turtle and Bill Bryson and Woods Dragon and 42 for being instrumental in getting us there.<br/>
