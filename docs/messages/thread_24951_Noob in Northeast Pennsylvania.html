Hazelton, PA is Indigo Vulture Country (he lives in nearby Nescopeck) <br/>
and he has planted many a box in that neck of the woods.  You may also <br/>
want to check out nearby Hickory Run.  There are also some boxes <br/>
listed on Atlas Quest, but a few area boxers chose not to post the <br/>
clues there any longer, but continue to do so on letterboxing.org.<br/>
