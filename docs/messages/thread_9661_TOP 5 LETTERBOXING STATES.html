deserve that honor, half-baked pie or not, per Ryan's post.  <br/>

I can't believe Oregon has so many now.  Just a couple years ago Der Mad<br/>
Stamper and Thom Cheney's letterboxes were all that were happening.<br/>
They were the spark that made it happen out here!  I hid some boxes here<br/>
and there...Then along came the amazing Ryan and Funhog.  Not to mention<br/>
others who have graced our presence with sprinklings of their beautiful<br/>
boxes!  <br/>
<br/>
The one thing about Oregon is that it's so perfect for this hobby!  And<br/>
so often we have gone out searching for letterboxes and if it weren't<br/>
for letterboxing, we might not know some of these places exist or if we<br/>
knew they existed, may not necessarily have bothered to make a focused<br/>
effort to check them out. <br/>
<br/>
I don't care about the numbers, but I do love it that I live in a<br/>
wonderful state where there are lots of beautiful places to go and so<br/>
many letterboxes to seek.  This sport has really come alive in the<br/>
Pacific NW!  Thanks to all who contribute!!!<br/>
