*I apologize for posting this to the national list, but as it <br/>
concerns a box in Mansfield Center, CT, it might be relevant to out-<br/>
of-towners.*<br/>
<br/>
On October 4, I received a tip from a boxer I met on the trail that <br/>
box #4 in my The Quest series was empty. I went by to have a look. <br/>
Sure enough, the box was placed carefully in its proper spot, <br/>
completely hidden, but the stamp and logbook were gone.<br/>
<br/>
I have adjusted the clues online to reflect this, and will be working <br/>
on a new stamp in the next couple of weeks to replace the one that <br/>
was lost. It occurs to me, however, that there's an outside chance <br/>
(since the box was properly replaced with apparent care) that a boxer <br/>
may have inadvertently stuffed the stamp and logbook baggie into <br/>
their backpack along with their own things. If anyone has been to <br/>
that box recently and discovers the Knight stowing away among their <br/>
things, please contact me off-list at hodsthorn@hotmail.com. <br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, anyone coming to Mansfield Center for the MMM will <br/>
want to adjust their clues for the Quest, which is alongside a series <br/>
of Mash boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
