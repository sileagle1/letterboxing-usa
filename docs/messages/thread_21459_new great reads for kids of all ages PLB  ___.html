The snowy mountains of Colorado mixed with some serious letterboxing cabin fever prompted me to think about starting up a new postal letterboxing ring.  I thought that it would be great fun to pick out some of our favorite kids books and pass them around with a stamp.  We could all enjoy a new read or two (little kid or BIG kid) and maybe find a new favorite that we didn't even know was out there.<br/>
<br/>
I have dibs on Where the WIld Things are and another one called Whisper in the Woods.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to participate in this ring email me at jodiemkern@yahoo.com.  I will take responses for a couple of weeks and then post a list with those that replied and we can get started.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  Jodie<br/>
