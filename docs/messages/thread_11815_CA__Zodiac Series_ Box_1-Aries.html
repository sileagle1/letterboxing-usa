with anything awful like that.  I'm an astrologer and thought this series was <br/>
a natural for me. The stamps will depict images indicative of the <br/>
astrological signs--Aries the Ram, Taurus the bull, etc., which I hope to do <br/>
in order and at the same time give a few hints about what the particular <br/>
astrological signs are like.<br/>
<br/>
I happened to grow up in the S.F. Bay Area and was a teenager at the time of <br/>
the dreaded Zodiac killer. We were afraid to walk the streets! I've always <br/>
been sorry the word Zodiac was maligned in that way.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>

 Not to worry. For me, the word Zodiac conjures up many fond memories of bouncing over the waves on scuba <br/>
diving adventures in some amazing places. Funhog<br/>
