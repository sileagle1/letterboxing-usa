Have you made a box/stamp/logbook by hand?  Maybe a small project <br/>
like that could help motivate and be a family thing.  My children <br/>

cool locations and a picnic reward at the end.  My children also LOVE <br/>
to carve, create clues and hide boxes.  They carving skills are awesome <br/>
for their ages.  We have hidden boxes for birthday parties with friends <br/>
and other events and never posted them online.  We have had tons of fun <br/>
doing this.  <br/>

Someday when they are no longer around 24/7 I will up my fcount until <br/>
then I enjoy the longer hikes with my dog only a few times a year.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm afraid I don't have many answers for you but I can sympathize.  My <br/>
13 yo DD will gladly come along but the boys are not so willing.  The 9 <br/>
yo is OK with it probably because he is usually  the one who finds the <br/>
boxes (although he is starting to get leery (sp?) because of the <br/>
mountain lion warning signs at one trail.)  The11 yo is dead set against <br/>
it and DH will tolerate it only because it makes me happy. <br/>
<br/>
My solutions to getting them to like it have been to bring along some <br/>
snacks that we don't normally have, give them their own compass, let <br/>
them take turns in finding the boxes (which makes it hard because 2 of <br/>
them give up to easily), and find walking sticks for the ones who get <br/>
tired after 5 minutes.  I have learned that a good meal is a must before <br/>
heading out.  One time the 11 yo was hungry so he just sat down on the <br/>
trail and refused to go anywhere till he got some lunch.  B-|<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that helped was to go out with another family.  The kids <br/>
had fun with the other kids.  Unfortunately, they live a couple states <br/>
away so we don't get together much.  I'm trying to get another family <br/>
involved but its going slow.<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to hear of the other ideas you get...Cindy  B-)<br/>

WHen we started last year, I told the kids about letterboxing and we went to the store and I had them pick out their own stamp. We use their nicknames as their trailnames, but we have a family trail name as well. Then, I got them each a logbook, and when we go out to look for the box, my parents and I (my hubby is not inot it) let one of them in charge of that "hunt".  We help them read the directions, and the one picked to do find the box, is the one to retrieve it and the 1st to stamp in.  Then, we help him (or her) hide the box back, and we go to the next one, and let someone have a turn.  They consider it a treasure hunt and they love to go.  =)  Maybe by letting him be somewhat "in charge" of one of the findings will make it fun for him, and maybe letting him have his own stamp, if he doesnt have one already.   And if he likes to draw or do crafts, maybe let him try to make his own<br/>
 stamp.  My kids had a blast this past winter making stamps for postal letterboxing.  This year, we plan on planitng them in the wild.<br/>

experience with this dilema.  I've gotten used to letterboxing<br/>
alone locally, but when traveling with family on trips I sneak<br/>
in boxing by picking places with activities that appeal to the<br/>
rest of the family.  Maybe a good birdwatching site for my wife<br/>
or a great playground for the kids.  Sometimes the kids will even<br/>
letterbox with me once we get there, but I don't force it.  Don't<br/>
try to make them letterboxers, but do keep taking them outdoors.<br/>
If they gain an appreciation for nature it will be worth it.<br/>

stamp that really captured is attention. So far he has carved four <br/>
and is ready to hide them. He also wants to go hiking to find some of <br/>
the Lb's I have been telling him about. I am teaching how to pace and <br/>
use a compass now, which until he carved the stamp he could have <br/>
