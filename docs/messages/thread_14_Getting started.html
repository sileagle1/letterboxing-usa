This page now has the text included.  Please have a look if you have<br/>
time and feel so inclined.  If any of you know the addresses of the<br/>
links mentioned, please forward them to me.<br/>
<br/>
I also thought it would be a nice touch, where people are mentioned, to<br/>
include the e-mail link, and where they are not mentioned, to perhaps<br/>
mention them.  Are any of you so inclined to be listed as a person to<br/>
contact concerning given topics?  This page is geared toward first<br/>
contacts, so if you would feel comfortable saying, "This is how I did<br/>
it..." for example, that would help -- just to take a few minutes to jot<br/>
out an e-mail.  I don't believe people will be breaking down our doors<br/>
until perhaps spring, but by then it would be nice to have a few people<br/>
in line to field these kinds of questions.  Anybody who has a box out<br/>
there qulaifies.  Do any of you want to volunteer as a "newbie mentor"?<br/>
<br/>
I hope it will become a theme throughout Letterbox USA that its a place<br/>
where questions are answered -- perhaps not quickly, but adequately.  It<br/>
shouldn't be too hard to do this when you consider the topic.  Its just<br/>
plain old fun!<br/>
<br/>
I mean we could try to describe every last detail of the hobby on our<br/>
web pages, be redundant, not miss a stroke, etc.  You know, attempt to<br/>
build a system that does everything but wipe their butts for them? <br/>
That's what many web sites attempt to do (and not all that well usually,<br/>
IMHO).  Or we can simply put people in touch with the right contacts,<br/>
people who in all likelihood will be able to tell them in a minute or<br/>
two what they need to know.  It could be how to make a stamp, use a map,<br/>
read a compass, etc.  What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
As always, I welcome your input and promise to use it, so don't be shy.<br/>
<br/>
Dan'l<br/>
<br/>
Ps.  Nice photo and text Erik!<br/>

 I love the pictures paired with the short text links ~ really makes<br/>
it clear what you're talking about and not nearly so intimidating as<br/>
just reading it. Great job!<br/>
 Do y'all plan a page for letterbox searchers also? I know a<br/>
notebook was mentioned .... did I miss anything else?<br/>
Would be great to photograph a checklist for someone setting<br/>
out to find a box ~ besides compass and map, some things<br/>
might be useful but easy to forget. Things like a ziplock bag<br/>
of damp paper towels or wet wipes to clean the stamp before<br/>
and after logging, brush markers to log the stamp in multiple<br/>
colors, a pen to write with, a bottle of champagne to celebrate!<br/>
Thanks much to all involved!<br/>

The new "getting started" page is fantastic!!!!  This is exacly what was<br/>
needed for newcomers.  (By the way, Dan, I went through it and added some of<br/>
the links for you.  Hope this helps.)<br/>
<br/>
I think you already know that I am always willing to field any newbie<br/>
questions.  Feel free to include my name/address in anything of this nature.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch<br/>

	Thanks for putting up the "getting started" page so quickly. Nice<br/>
Format as well. <br/>
<br/>
Actually, most of this text was written in response to questions fielded<br/>
by other "newbies", now old timers, in the past months.  So, naturally,<br/>
I'd always be happy to field questions where I can be of help. As will<br/>
Carvin' Susan. (However, point of information - the "Butler Island" and<br/>
"Arnold's Gambit" stamps I carved! Ha!).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also Mitch for adding in the links - I was getting sleepy.<br/>
<br/>
I like this team effort - it feels right.<br/>

I think we all agree that no posing (to look sensible) should be required... I<br/>
think a CANDID shot is in order here. As long as the camera man is somewhat<br/>
steady at the time... (tell everyone to focus)... it'll be a wonderful<br/>
picture.<br/>
