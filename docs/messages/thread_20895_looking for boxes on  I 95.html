Look down the index on the right and you'll see I-95 Letterboxes.  It <br/>
lists quite a few.<br/>

I second this (and I am a woman!) as I was searching for a box at a<br/>
truck weigh-in station this summer and a man in a non-descript white<br/>
van who said he was a cop grilled me on why I was poking around the<br/>
woods. I finally had to fall back on the old standby "I had to pee" It<br/>
scared me enough to not do that alone again!<br/>

PS Rest stops are a different matter, though. I wouldn't worry about<br/>
them as much, but then again, I am woman.<br/>
