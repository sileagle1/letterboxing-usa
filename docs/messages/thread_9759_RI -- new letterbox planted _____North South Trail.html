having.  After finishing my Christmas shopping I took advantage of <br/>
the nice weather to plant a new letterbox.  This letterbox is along <br/>
the North South Trail in Richmond, RI (Washington County).  So <br/>
without further ado here are the clues.  <br/>

North South Trail  The Pines<br/>
Richmond, RI<br/>
(Washington County)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  Clues: easy.  Hike: 2 miles round trip.  Mt. bike <br/>
friendly trail.<br/>
<br/>
Background:  The North South Trail  (NST) runs 77 miles from the <br/>
Rhode Island's southern shore at the Atlantic Ocean in Charlestown to <br/>
its northern border at the Massachusetts line in Burrillville. The <br/>
North South Trail was proposed over three decades ago by George <br/>
Ernst, a hiker from Cranston.  He suggested building new trails and <br/>
connecting them together with already existing hiking trials to <br/>
create a long path across the state.  The state of RI studied the <br/>
idea in 1978 but the trail wasn't actually built until 1991. The <br/>
North South Trail letterbox series will be a series of letterboxes <br/>
placed along various points on the trail to celebrate this <br/>
achievement.  Each stamp will contain a common image that represents <br/>
the NST as well as an image unique to the stamp's location. The North <br/>
South Trail  The Pines is the first letterbox in this series.<br/>
<br/>
Driving Directions: Take Rt 3 in Richmond to the intersection with <br/>
Baker's Pine Rd (near the I-95 overpass at exit 4.) The New London <br/>
Turnpike crosses Baker's Pine Rd at .2 miles.  This is the start<br/>
of your hike.  Park your car on the right side of the road by the <br/>
metal barway. <br/>
<br/>
Clues:  From Baker's Pine Rd follow the North South Trail south west <br/>
along the New London Turnpike (the dirt road with the barway NOT the <br/>
paved road.) After a short distance (about  mile) the trail turns <br/>
left into the woods.  Along this trail there are several crossing <br/>
unmarked trails so be sure to follow the North South Trail markers <br/>
and the blue blazes.  After a short while you will pass a double blue <br/>
blaze marking a right turn in the trail.  Continue along the North <br/>
South Trail.  The trail will pass through a break in a stone wall; <br/>
will go down a small hill then through a break in a second stone <br/>
wall.  When you come to a Y in the trail with an oak tree with a <br/>
North South Trail marker on it in the middle of the Y -- STOP.  At <br/>
this point the North South Trail goes to the left.  You will take the <br/>
trail that goes to the right.   As you walk onto this trail there <br/>
will be a stone wall on your left.  Follow the trail a short distance <br/>
until you come to a break in the stone wall.  Walk through the break <br/>
in the wall.  The North South Trail -- The Pines letterbox is on the <br/>
right in a crevice between the first and second large stones on the <br/>
bottom of the wall.  After stamping in return to your car the same <br/>
way you came.<br/>
