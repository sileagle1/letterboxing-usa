clues:<br/>
<br/>
Kennedy Park Grackle Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Azroadie<br/>
Placement date: September 29, 2004<br/>
State:  Arizona<br/>
County:   Pima<br/>
Nearest city:  Tucson<br/>
Difficulty:   Walk  easy, about 15 minutes one way.  Clues <br/>
easy<br/>
<br/>
The letterbox is in John F. Kennedy Park in far southwest Tucson, <br/>
Arizona.  From I-19 take Exit 99 and go west on Ajo Way for about <br/>
1.5 miles.  Go right (north) on La Cholla Blvd. for about 0.3 <br/>
miles.  Turn left (west) onto the second park entrance road and park <br/>
near the restrooms.<br/>
<br/>
Walk west to the end of the paved park road.  Walk west on the dirt <br/>
trail that starts at the end of the paved road and goes through an <br/>
opening in the barbed wire fence.  After walking through the fence <br/>
opening and going up a slope you will arrive at a wide dirt road.  <br/>
Go left (south) on the dirt road for a short distance until you <br/>
arrive at a trail crossing identified by light gray painted rocks <br/>
lining the trail.  Go right (west) on the trail up slope.  After <br/>
winding around a little (but still going roughly west) you will go <br/>
down and up a small shallow gully.  You will soon arrive at a small <br/>
pile on your left of old pebbly paving material (macadam).  From the <br/>
top of the pile go exactly north up hill on a faint 4-wheel road for <br/>
a short distance to its end at a small flat dirt area.  From the <br/>
center of the flat area go at about 330 degrees (from north) up <br/>
slope for about 20 paces to a small Palo Verde Tree.  The box is <br/>
under a pile of rocks under the northwest side of the tree.  Be <br/>
alert for snakes and scorpions!  Enjoy the view of the Tucson <br/>
basin.  To the east are the Rincon Mountains; to the north are the <br/>
Santa Catalina Mountains; and you are standing in the foothills of <br/>
the Tucson Mountains.<br/>
<br/>
The first person to find this box will find a surprise!  <br/>
