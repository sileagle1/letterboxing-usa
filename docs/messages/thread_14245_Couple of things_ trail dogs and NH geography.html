<br/>
We have 2 unrelated items in this post - sorry!<br/>
<br/>
On the trail dogs issue - we wholeheartedly agree that the safest thing for<br/>
all involved (especially the doggies) is to be on leash.  The system we<br/>
found that works great for Morgan is called The Buddy System - it actually<br/>
attaches to a belt, so you are hands-free.  You can check it out at<br/>
www.buddysys.com<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, on to the second thing...we planted a box at Lucia's Lookout in NH<br/>
last weekend (along the Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway) and we weren't positive<br/>
about our county location.  We listed it as Sullivan, since that's what it<br/>
looks like on a map.  And we listed the nearest city as Washington, since we<br/>
camped at Pillsbury State Park in Washington.  Any NH folks out there to<br/>
confirm or correct our closest guesses?  The wierd thing is that if I put in<br/>
Cheshire county it shows up when I click on the clue map on the web site<br/>
(letterboxing.org), but if I leave it as Sullivan I can't find it anywhere<br/>
besides doing a search.  Any thoughts???<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Much!<br/>
