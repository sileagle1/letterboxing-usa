<p><strong>In Memory of Brandi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Placed: 5-11-02</strong></p>
<p><strong>Placed By: Chuck Straub and Molly</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location: Lebanon Connecticut, New London 
County</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rated: Easy</strong></p><strong> </strong>
<p><strong>At the intersection of Routes 66 and 85 in Hebron, take 
route 85 south headed for Colchester. Proceed until you come to Route 207 and 
turn left onto 207. You will go up a small hill. The rail road line crosses 
route 207 here and there is good parking. After parking, you will take the trail 
on the left hand side of the road which is the old air line rail road and is 
going northeast. Proceed down the old air line rail road. The trail starts off 
very straight and has been improved with gravel for hiking. The trail will go 
alongside a small brook. What you are looking for is a gap that was cut through 
the stone when making the rail road. There is a very small cut you will go 
through and this one may fool you. The one you are looking for is the first one 
you come to with large stone ledge on the right and a small amount showing on 
the left. It is not huge but is taller than a person. Go to a point on the trail 
where the south side ledge is at its highest. Look at that point for a man made 
mark of a shaft that cut through the ledge to split it. Take a reading of 350 
degrees and look on top of the opposite hill to see two small to medium size oak 
trees that are growing from one trunk. In the gap between them where they join 
together, there is a small rock wedged between them. This is the tell tale sign 
that you are at the right location. You have to get to that tree. Please go to a 
point that is not so steep to get to this tree on top of the hill. There is a 
pile of rocks against the tree. Remove a couple rocks to reveal the box. When 
you leave the parking area be very careful. You cannot see the traffic coming 
over the hill.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This box was planted in memory of my best friend, and 
hiking partner. We traveled throughout this area over 15 years ago, on and off 
trails, through Lebanon, Hebron and Columbia. She knew every hill, valley, lake, 
swamp and stream and shared many memorable adventures with me. I could not have 
had a better or truer friend than my dog Brandi.
