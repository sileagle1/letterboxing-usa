Ok, I know what a letterbox stamp is, it stays at the site and is the<br/>
one folks use when they find your Lbox.  I'll call this  #1- box<br/>
stamp. When I make a new LB I put an impression of the # 1 box stamp<br/>
in the new log book as well as my own stamp - the one I use when<br/>
finding other boxes, call this #2.  Is #2 my personal stamp?  What is<br/>
a personal traveller?  Diff stamp or same as #2?  Do you typically put<br/>
an impression of number 2 in the log book when you plant a new LB?  <br/>
<br/>
Thx for the input, couldn't find the answer to these ??? on the LB<br/>
site.<br/>

Thx Mama Stork, I hadn't seen that glossary despite many hours on the<br/>
LBNA site.  Still not sure what the convention is when one creates a<br/>
new LB, do you add your personal stamp to it?  Or just the stamp you<br/>
created for that box?<br/>

As for the personal traveler, this is a stamp carried<br/>
with you. Some times these stamps have a question or<br/>
puzzel to be solved so when you meet a boxer at a<br/>
gathering or on the trail if you know the answer you<br/>
can get the stamp in your log. <br/>
