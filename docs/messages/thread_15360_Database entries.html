you that I removed my 50-some entries yesterday.  When it was <br/>
proposed, I said I didn't think it would work - although not for the <br/>
reasons that transpired.  I just thought not many people would bother <br/>
to post their finds - it does take a bit of time.  Nevertheless, I <br/>
did my personal best to help it succeed by posting all the finds we <br/>
had made so far.  I never envisioned the extreme opposition from some <br/>
box-owners.  Some of them have some very thoughtful, well reasoned <br/>
logic for their opposition - some are a bit over the top.  In any <br/>
case it became clear to me that it can not work in it's present <br/>
form.  The poll results made it clear that there is a significant <br/>
level of opposition and the steady stream of 'Don't list my boxes' <br/>
messages as well as vandalism of the database demonstrated that this <br/>
database can never be as comprehensive and accurate as those who wish <br/>
for a database want it to be.  Therefore, I have removed all my <br/>
entries from the database.  I had already added status lines to my <br/>
clues - for now I think that is the best we can hope for.<br/>
