<br/>
   Sue and I had planned to go letterboxing on Saturday earlier in <br/>
the week and even though the area received over 8" of snow yesterday, <br/>
we went today. It was a great crisp and clear day. Our destination <br/>
was Holcomb Farm in West Granby, CT which is the home of many boxes. <br/>
We found the locations for 2 boxes but the snow cover made it <br/>
impossible to find the boxes even after we dug many inches down into <br/>
the snow. The clues were great; but the snow was too deep! <br/>
<br/>
  This got me thinking [which can be a dangerous thing!] . . . <br/>
wouldn't it be a good idea to come up with a universal way we can all <br/>
rate the boxes we plant that are obtainable all year around, winter <br/>
included? Maybe come up with a symbol - a snow flake? This way crazy <br/>
people like us would have an idea what we were getting into!! <br/>
<br/>
  We did end up finding 2 boxes which were hidden above ground level: <br/>
The Bluebird and Four From One, both placed by Tree Fairy &amp; Chester <br/>
Copperpot. We got to meet and talk to Tree Fairy but she didn't have <br/>
her stamp with her which meant no exchange! This is a beautiful <br/>
location that we look forward to revisiting in the spring. <br/>
<br/>
  Let me know what you all think about a universal method to denote a <br/>
letterbox is an "all year around" box.<br/>
