<br/>
I was wondering if it would be possible to get one person from each state to join Team Rayvenhaus on taking on another "A box in each of the 50 States" attempt?<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, please write me back, off list, and let me know.. This is an idea we've been tossing around over the past few weeks (Well, you know, with RayvenMom just now starting to get back into hiking, we've had LOTS of time for talking and scheming and, well, other things!) and we'd like to give it an attempt, but, since we are not independently wealthy, nor work any longer in a job that allows for extensive travel, we'll have to rely on a join effort here.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you're interested, please contact me off list at XrayvenhausX@XmyndworxX.XcomX by removing the capital 'X's.<br/>

I don't know about finding boxes, but I've placed them in 25 states <br/>

I was just joking about the Funhog carving ALL the stamps.  Fifty <br/>
stamps is a lot to carve, and I just like to give her a hard <br/>

Although there is something to be said if somebody local carved and <br/>

theme and have commissioned the stamps to be carved by none other than our<br/>
very own RayvenMom, all we were looking for was volunteers to plant the<br/>
boxes in the other states. We'd handle the Washington state one obviously,<br/>

I can not adequately share the feelings that I have knowing that you are<br/>
taking the time to help us out and ensure that we've thought of everything.<br/>
Your knowledge and experience levels are more than I can hope to achieve  in<br/>
such a short time and, as GI Joe points out, knowing is half the battle.  I<br/>
am glad though that our enthusiasm levels are not so bothersome to you<br/>
anymore.<br/>

&gt; How do I plan on addressing what 'issue'?  Team Rayvenhaus would <br/>
like to<br/>
&gt; place a letterbox in each of the 50 states.  Kinda lofty goal I <br/>
know, but<br/>
&gt; with the help of the good people of this mailing list, we'll be <br/>
able to do<br/>
&gt; it, no matter how long it takes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what 'issue' you are referring to at <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
Just to chime in - the state bird of Massachusetts is the chickadee, <br/>
and I have found more than one box with names that have no reference <br/>
whatsoever to the state bird here in MA.  And of the three (so far) <br/>
that I have found, the stamp was a store bought stamp, not hand <br/>
carved.<br/>
<br/>
I think Rayvenhaus' idea is a great one and wouldn't impinge on any <br/>
other box, especially since it will be hand carved and part of a <br/>
nationwide series.  I have already signed up to plant in RI and MA <br/>
since I live in both states.<br/>

I can't wait to see the image of the Rhode Island Red!<br/>
