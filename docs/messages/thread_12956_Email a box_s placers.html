You can now send a message to a box's placer by using the "Contact the<br/>
placer" link on the box's page.<br/>
The sender of the message never sees your email address, so don't worry<br/>
about spambots picking it up.<br/>
<br/>
Note, this only works for boxes that don't redirect you to a personal site.<br/>
You'll have to find the contact info on the placer's page.<br/>
<br/>
Comments appreciated.<br/>

I'd been trying to alert a box placer for 2 weeks concerning a missing box. <br/>
(I replanted one in its place and didn't' want to step on toes by posting <br/>
this for all without his/hers thoughts on the matter) All I could do was put <br/>
the box name in the 'subject' line of the regular site. Yet, no response. <br/>
<br/>
I've just tried to alert the owner through your new system--A great idea! <br/>
I'll let you know if and when I hear from them.<br/>

However, I was referring to the www.letterboxing.org website. Previously,<br/>
