&gt;I don't know what you put in your salad but if it has mayo, I wanted to give<br/>
&gt;you an idea: last summer I went to a barbecue with some southern potato salad<br/>
&gt;I made which included mayonnaise in the recipe and people got sick as it was<br/>
&gt;sitting out on the picnic table for hours so I now use Nayonnaise, which is a<br/>
&gt;soy-based "mayo" and doesn't include the raw egg.<br/>
<br/>
While this may seem completely off topic, I'll try my best to make it <br/>
relevant. :-) According to food researchers, and countering everything your <br/>
mother ever told you, comercially prepared mayonnaise is *not* the culprit <br/>
in food poisonings such as these. The eggs are pasteurized, unlike those in <br/>
homemade mayonnaises. In fact, some research indicates that commercial <br/>
mayo's vinegar content actually inhibits growth of bacteria.<br/>
<br/>
Check out these links from The Association for Dressings and Sauces for <br/>
some theories and scientific citations. (By the way, their PR campaign to <br/>
repair mayo's tainted reputation even includes a brochure entitled, <br/>
"Mayonnaise: The Misunderstood Dressing." Bonus points to anyone who can <br/>
get a copy of this page turner!)<br/>

<br/>
Some people (I, however, am not one of them) store opened jars of mayo in <br/>
their kitchen cabinets instead of in the refrigerator. Even the Hellman's <br/>
mayo site FAQs say refrigeration is to maintain flavor and stability, not <br/>
to prevent spoilage:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.mayo.com/faqs.asp#Mayo_Storage<br/>
<br/>
Note the conspicuous lack of dire warnings indicating that safe mayo <br/>
practices require refrigeration. What the FAQs do warn about is that <br/>
recipes *containing* mayo frequently have other perishable ingredients and <br/>
that's why refrigeration is important. The mayo itself is not the culprit.<br/>

<br/>
So definitely put the trailer trash macaroni on ice if there are perishable <br/>
ingredients, but don't be afraid of our poor maligned friend the mayo.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun at the gathering! I'm looking forward to the day when there are <br/>
more LBers in the Finger Lakes area of New York so we can plan a gathering <br/>
of our own.<br/>
