One of two letterboxes placed on a camping trip to Bay View State Park, <br/>
near Mount Vernon.<br/>
I think I'm becoming addicted to this! ;)<br/>

Bay View<br/>
<br/>
by Team Garlic<br/>
<br/>
A letterbox for one of my favorite state parks.<br/>
<br/>
To get to Bay View State Park:<br/>
 From I-5 north or south, take exit #230. Follow Hwy. 20 seven miles west <br/>
to Bay View-Edison Rd. Signs will alert you to a right turn. Turn right <br/>
onto Bay View-Edison Rd. The park is four miles north of Hwy. 20.<br/>
<br/>
 From the beach parking lot, go up the hill underneath the overpass.<br/>
Go up the stairs and towards the campground, past the pay booth, to the <br/>
restrooms.<br/>
Take the path on the east side facing the restrooms.<br/>
Go straight along this path past the group campsites.<br/>
You will come to three mossy rocks underneath the roots of a fallen tree.<br/>
The letterbox is behind and under the uppermost rock, covered with <br/>
leaves and twigs.<br/>
<br/>
(If you come to a wire fence, you've gone too far - go back to previous <br/>
turn in the trail.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Parking Note:<br/>
The beach parking lot requires a Washington State Parks permit, or a $5 <br/>
day use fee.<br/>
Enjoying the beach is well worth the cost for me, but frugal and speedy <br/>
letterboxers may wish to park by the restrooms in the 15 minute parking <br/>
spaces for free instead.<br/>
