Discovered last week that the Elizabeth Cady Stanton - Women's Hall of <br/>
Fame Lb has gone missing without a trace.  Originally planted along a <br/>
brushy fence-line in a Seneca Falls village park, it was found last <br/>
October to have been bared to the eye by zealous groundskeepers.  <br/>
Since the box itself was covered and well disguided under an inverted <br/>
green plastic flower pot, I left it in place for the winter (it surely <br/>
must have been well-covered by snow until recently).  I'll check with <br/>
the village people to see if they lifted it, and otherwise consider <br/>
its replacement in this historic place.<br/>
