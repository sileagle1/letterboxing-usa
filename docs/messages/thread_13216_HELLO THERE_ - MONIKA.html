Yeah that boots are fab!  A bit hard to run in but then even trainers <br/>
are a challenge for me.  The boots were left in the UK, btw, to dry <br/>
off.  Wasn't too keen on packing them, you know?<br/>
<br/>
How long have you been letterboxing?  I see this as a lifelong <br/>
adventure.  I'm just surprised it took me so long to hear about it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to meet some time so you can share your adventures.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

&gt; Hello and Greetings!<br/>
&gt; Love the boots! I would wear a pair of boots like that if I had to <br/>
&gt; wade through whatever "poody" to find some tupperware. You better <br/>
&gt; bring along the boots if your first stop is the east coast. The <br/>
rainy <br/>
&gt; weather has turned a lot of places into marshes. If you ever go <br/>
&gt; hunting for boxes on the west coast(S.F. area)just drop me an e-<br/>
mail <br/>
&gt; if you wish to do an exchange. Happy Hunting! <br/>

&gt; &gt; I've been bitten!  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; How cool is it that this sport (is that what we call it?) <br/>
satisfies <br/>
&gt; &gt; my love of riddles and snooping and rubberstamping!    <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, here I am.  I am a neophyte Letterboxer but I had the <br/>
great <br/>
&gt; &gt; experience of cutting the first of my babyteeth on the moor.  <br/>
First <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox found in a Museum (is that cheating???) in Okehampton, <br/>
&gt; &gt; Dartmoor.  We found our next in the Plume &amp; Feather . . . a pub.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Gotta love that.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We eventually wandered out onto the moor even though it was misty <br/>
&gt; as <br/>
&gt; &gt; heck and the squish under our boots was NOT the marsh.  Hey, it's <br/>
&gt; &gt; gotta be love when a priss like me doesn't mind wading through <br/>
&gt; horse <br/>
&gt; &gt; and sheep poodey looking for tupperware!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; All tolled we walked away from Dartmoor with 40 stamps in our <br/>
&gt; &gt; journals.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Next stop?  AMERICA!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Cheers!<br/>

&gt; &gt; PS  The mail letterboxing idea is fab!  I'd love to join in.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; PPS  BTW, there was a box under that rock to the left.  :o)<br/>
