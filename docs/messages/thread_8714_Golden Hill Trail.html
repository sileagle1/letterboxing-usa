Distance 1 mile<br/>
<br/>
At the intersection of 44 and 169 in Pomfret Center turn onto 169 north.<br/>
Then go about 1/4 mile up and take a right onto Day Rd.Travel all the<br/>
way to the end of Day Rd., you will come to a stop sign. Take a right<br/>
onto Needles Eye Rd. Go up towards the stop sign. On the left you will<br/>
notice a white sanctuary sign and room enough to park a few cars on the<br/>
grass. From the stop sign cross the street. There will be a white sign<br/>
saying Walking Trail. This is the entrance for Golden Hill Trail. Go<br/>
into the field and go to your left. Follow the trail all the way down<br/>
the edge of the field. Eventually the trail will bend to the right and<br/>
you will go up a hill.(in the fall notice all the golden leaves on the<br/>
trees. There is no question why they call this the Golden Hill Trail).<br/>
Half way up the hill on your left you will notice a tree cut in half<br/>
with 2 sisters growing out of it. (at this point turn around and look<br/>
off at the beautiful farmhouse. The view is worth the walk).  Continue<br/>
on the trail.Then there will be a path that bares off to the left. DO<br/>
NOT TAKE -PRIVATE PROPERTY. Continue up a little more and you will see a<br/>
sign with an arrow pointing into the woods.Enter the woods at this<br/>
point. Pass through the stone wall. To your left you will see a couple<br/>
of big oak trees growing near a big boulder. Also notice the dark blue<br/>
blazes on the trees. Keep walking until you get to a arrow trail marker,<br/>
just keep going straight down the hill around the bend, to the right.<br/>
You will come to another arrow marker sign and stay straight here<br/>
also.Soon you will bend to the right and go down a hill with rock ledge<br/>
on your right and left. The trail will bend to the left around some rock<br/>
ledge and so will you. The trail will start getting alittle rocky here<br/>
but it gets better after awhile. Soon you will cross a tiny stream on a<br/>
bridge made of stone. The trail will bend to the right. There will be a<br/>
rock about a foot and a half high in the middle of the trail. Alittle<br/>
further the trail will bend to the left and you will pass through a<br/>
stone wall. Then the trail bends to the right and you will pass through<br/>
another stone wall. Go through the wall and go down on the left side.<br/>
You will come to a tree with 2 sisters. From this tree you will take 7<br/>
paces over a dead log down the wall. Leaning at the bottom of the wall<br/>
you will see a flat stone shaped like an arrowhead. The second letterbox<br/>
will be behind these rocks in the stone wall. After rehiding go back out<br/>
to the trail and continue on. The trail will loop around to the right.<br/>
Cross over a small stream bed over some rocks. Then pass through a<br/>
couple of stone walls. The trail will bend to the left and then back to<br/>
the right going uphill. You will come to a T with an arrow marker sign.<br/>
Make a left here.This will put you back on the same path you came down.<br/>
Follow the path all the way back to the field. Go to the right and<br/>
follow the edge of the field all the way back to your car.<br/>
