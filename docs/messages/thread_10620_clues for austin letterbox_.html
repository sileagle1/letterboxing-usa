box is "box of ants"  You will need to do some hiking, will encounter<br/>
some rough terrain, and be able to hoist yourself up a rock wall at the<br/>
end.<br/>
Clues.<br/>
1. a good place to eat soup on the greenbelt<br/>
2. east side of creek, about 180 paces downstream from the top of the<br/>
rapids.<br/>
3. look for a dropoff of about 4 feet, look for a "ramp" to get down.<br/>
4. 30 paces to the troll's staircase leading into the forest.<br/>
5. about twenty five paces from top of staircase, look to your left<br/>
6. one of these things is not like the others<br/>
7. from here go straight to base of cliff<br/>
8. find flat rock at base, about 1 foot tall and 3 to 4 feet wide/long.<br/>
you will know its the one if you can see a "curb" to your right.<br/>
9. look up.<br/>
