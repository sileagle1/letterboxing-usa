Does anyone ever worry that no one is going to look for the box you placed?  <br/>
I guess we should go back and check on it and see.  But, what if there are <br/>
no stamps?  What if it is missing?  What if some park ranger confiscated it <br/>
and we will never know?<br/>
<br/>
I guess we just have to not worry about it!  We certainly have fun looking <br/>
for other people's boxes.  And we may even try to plant another one.  That's <br/>
fun to do too.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that's why we leave a little message every time we find a box.  It's <br/>
a little thank you and maybe a little reassurance to a boxer who would be <br/>
happy to know that he or she planted a box and someone else went looking...<br/>

&gt;<br/>

<br/>
&gt; One more thing...  Just wanted to let you know that one of the<br/>
&gt; parties that recently sent me an e-mail to let me know they had<br/>
&gt; visited a few of my boxes, mentioned they had also been out to the<br/>
&gt; Muskegon Beach Box and the box was there, but the stamp was missing.<br/>
&gt; They were going to let the individual who placed the box know about<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You may want to check if that has been replaced before looking for<br/>
&gt; that one.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Cool!!!  I may get to putting out a couple of additional ones next<br/>

&gt; &gt; reports on most of them within the past month or so.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The event looks interesting and seeing how it is right here in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Muskegon, it would be fun.  Even though I don't usually letterbox<br/>

I have checked on my Forest Hill Park boxes here in Richmond, VA, but<br/>
not in the last couple of months. I haven't checked on my Univ. of<br/>
Richmond box since I planted it in August, however. (Hmmmmmmmm, maybe<br/>
I'll do that tomorrow . . .) And I planted three other ones recently,<br/>
so I'm going to wait a while to check on them.<br/>
<br/>
Another boxer posted that it's his/her orphans he/she worries about,<br/>
and I agree. I planted three in Alaska in September. I left<br/>
instructions on the box label for boxers to e-mail me letting me know<br/>
the boxes' status, but who knows if that'll happen? I just tried to<br/>
have fun finding the out-of-the-way places I hid them.<br/>

This is just the boost we need to venture out in this unseasonably cold <br/>
weather (but, hey, at least it's safe to go outside at all) and plant <br/>
another box!<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you liked the gardens!  It is like a hidden oasis once you pass <br/>
through the visitors center.  We hope you got to see the ducks, geese, <br/>
tadpoles, turtles, etc. (but not the Puma which was rumored to be loose <br/>
there about three years ago....)<br/>
<br/>
I hope people know that the walk isn't too long even though you cross a lot <br/>
of different areas.  There are, however, all different trails, paved, <br/>
mulched, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah!  Thanks again! BeMa<br/>

&gt; Cool!!!  I may get to putting out a couple of additional ones next<br/>
&gt; week and replacing the Mystery Mink.  As far as I know all boxes<br/>
&gt; except the little mink are still in place, I've checked or heard<br/>
&gt; reports on most of them within the past month or so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The event looks interesting and seeing how it is right here in<br/>
&gt; Muskegon, it would be fun.  Even though I don't usually letterbox<br/>
&gt; with my dogs, we do have dogs (2 pugs).  But unfortunately I will be<br/>
&gt; out of town at a wedding next weekend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have fun!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder that a lot because there are so few boxers in this area.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; There are a couple of active hunters and they will usually send<br/>
&gt; me e-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mails, which I really appreciate.  I occasionally will check on my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes, sometimes it is a disappointment because nobody has been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there, other times I am pleasantly surprised to see a stamp or<br/>
&gt; two,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with no idea who they came from, somebody who has chosen to remain<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anonymous...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I especially wonder about boxes that I have placed in other<br/>
&gt; states,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because I can't just go look at the log book, or to see if it is<br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; still there.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I recently had a box go missing and can't help wondering if anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; had even been to it before it disappeared, since I hadn't heard<br/>
&gt; any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; report.  Guess it will remain a mystery, and I will just carve a<br/>
&gt; new<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stamp and replace it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree, it is nice to send/receive e-mails about boxing activity,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but there is also something to be said for the mystery...  and the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; surprise of finding those unidentified stamps in the log book!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am having fun planting them and truly believe that eventually<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hobby will catch on around here (I have seen much increased<br/>
&gt; interest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; just in the past couple of months), and then my boxes will surely<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have visitors.<br/>
