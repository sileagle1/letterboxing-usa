                    <div class="plaintext-content">The first letterbox I planted was Mr. Chong's Box on March 14, 2003.  <br/>
I had been hunting boxes for a whole month and was eager to plant my <br/>
own.  Sir Balthazar designed the image at my request, I carved it and <br/>
put the box together and planted it.<br/>
<br/>
Since it was my first try, I chose a box way too big and hard to <br/>
conceal for such a public spot, and purchased a logbook that started <br/>
falling apart immediately.  All things considered, the box shouldn't <br/>
have lasted a month, but it is still there and has had almost 40 <br/>
letterboxing visitors.  I am proud of the box and the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I put it into a much smaller box and replaced the logbook <br/>
with a sturdy handmade version.  Looking at all the personal stamps <br/>
on the logbook I removed, I am realizing that I would be much sadder <br/>
to lose IT than the stamp itself.<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking now of replacing the logbooks in all my boxes every six <br/>
months, full or not, so that if the boxes disappear I won't lose that <br/>
wonderful record.  In a way, though, I hate to do it because when I <br/>
visit other people's boxes I always love flipping through the book to <br/>
see who else has been there- and I am depriving others of this <br/>
pleasure.  Still, I can't help feeling nervous about losing these <br/>
nifty documents.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have any opinions on this?<br/>

I do think the logbook is goig to be one of my most prized possessions and I<br/>
personally plan to do regular maintainence if possible.  I think replacing<br/>
the book is worth it.  Especially if the cover reflects that it has been<br/>
updated (Box placed 1/27/02; log book replaced 7/03/03 or whatever)<br/>
<br/>
Heck, I am jsut thrilled to find a box.  Looking at the other stamps is pure<br/>
bonus.<br/>

I agree with you that one of the best things about letterboxing is seeing <br/>
who's "come before". It's always interesting to see the personal stamps and <br/>
eventually come to recognize them from one box to another. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if you want to take the log book home for safekeeping, you can list, <br/>
on the first page of the new log book, the fact that this is a second book <br/>
then print a list of the 'names' of the stampers who stamped in the previous <br/>
book.<br/>
                LOG BOOK #2<br/>

                PrincessLea<br/>
                etc.<br/>
Just a thought.                  <br/>

I agree with you that it is fun to see who else has stamped in but...<br/>
<br/>
Well, that might mean color copying the thing, then there is the <br/>
extra space all those pages would take up. Would you, personally, do <br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
I know that my microboxes take all the interior space they can get. <br/>
Hard to fit a stamp and a small notebook in a film cannister. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe another suggestion might be your own website. You could scan <br/>
the pages, and then arrange them by date, and by box. In any case, <br/>
the effort may not be worth it. Guess everyone needs to judge this on <br/>
their own.<br/>
