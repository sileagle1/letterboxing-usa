I certainly don't mind searching here in Connecticut. I have an entire email <br/>
address solely for the purpose of Freecycle. If need be you can write an exact <br/>
discription of what you want...I will post it here in CT and get it to you.<br/>
Might not be as quickly as you need the trees but the offer is there.<br/>

If you want to join a list and don't want to receive all the postings<br/>
in your mailbox then join online at yahoogroups.com and choose the<br/>
settings "No Mail". Then if you ever want to check in to your group<br/>
you go to yahoogroups.com while you are logged in and all the groups<br/>
that you belong to are there. <br/>
I read all of my group mail on the web and I only check into Freecycle<br/>
occasionally but I could post a wanted add easily.<br/>
