to get down Penn ave. <br/>
<br/>
So two options-<br/>
<br/>
-meet at the Archives/Naval Memorial Metro station. Maybe the North <br/>
East corner of Indiana Ave. and 7th Street. 1:30pm<br/>

<br/>
-Meet at the same location after the parade maybe 3:30pm<br/>
<br/>
I know those with tickets are being asked to not bring bags if they <br/>
can. A stamp, pad, and 3x5 index pad may work, though. <br/>

First off, you are insane for going down there tomorrow.  Even if I <br/>
liked the guy I wouldn't be going down into that mad house.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, I know several locals and not so local boxers will be down <br/>
there.  Your best bet may be to seek out Scarab who will be at East <br/>
Market volunteering.  Look for the big guy with a beard in a red hat who <br/>
looks like he spent the night in his office, because, well, he had.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, you are going to need it.<br/>
