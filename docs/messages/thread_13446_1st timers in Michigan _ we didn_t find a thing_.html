Our first box was a bust because of closed roads so we couldn't even come close to the site.  Our second we found eventually, solved all the clues but no box.<br/>

If anyone has found the box at the Secret Garden in Royal Oak, MI, we'd sure like to have another hint.  We searched for a good hour in just a small location, (the gardens weren't all that big) but no luck.  Is the person who placed this box on the list?  Has anyone on the list found this box?  We went back twice to seach, we just hated to give up on our first letterbox!<br/>

Anyway, here's one more family in MI who's caught the bug.  We can't wait for our next outing.  What a great family activity!<br/>

didn't have a very successful first outing, I hope you don't get <br/>
discouraged and try again.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Secret Garden box...  I can't say for positive, but I <br/>
recall talk on the list a while back that several others had been <br/>
unsuccessful at finding the box and it was presumed missing.  Sorry <br/>
that you spent the time looking for it, but glad to hear you had a <br/>
nice time anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Hope your next adventure is more prosperous!<br/>
