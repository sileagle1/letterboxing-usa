I read your blog, and was sorry to read about the fate of this<br/>
particular box.  I have a cabin in Washington County, and get to the<br/>
LG area occasionally. Though I'm fairly familiar with the area, I<br/>
didn't know about the monument until I found your clues. It's a<br/>
beautiful location - a quiet respite from the hubbub of route 9 and<br/>
the LG area - and the stamp was perfect for the site. <br/>

Thanks. If it were one of my other boxes, I would recarve and repace <br/>
but I was already thinking of retiring it as I felt that the box was <br/>
a little too close to the Monument. If I hid it were I probably <br/>
should of there would be a geocache within 300 feet of my box and I <br/>
feel that is a little close. I may hide a box there, but it will be <br/>
much harder to find. I have some new plants in the works and I am <br/>
hopefully learning from this lost. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the kind words.<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully yours,<br/>
