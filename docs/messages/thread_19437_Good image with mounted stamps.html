This happens with the most expensive manufactured stamps also.  One trick, if you can do this with your log book, is to lay the paper on top of the stamp and rub the back of the paper with your fingers.  This guarantees that you get a sharp image.  It is one of the reasons I carry small pieces of paper that I then take home and glue into my letterboxing journal.  (That also means I don't have to carry the weight of my journal in my pack.)  Also, with the pieces of paper, if I get,a bad image, I just pull out another piece of paper and try again.  Hope this helps.<br/>
