<br/>
The way to post clues on LBNA is to follow their form.  Back when I<br/>
started letterboxing they had webmasters follow this list and take<br/>
clues from the list and put them on the site.  You can imagine how<br/>
much time that would take now.  I will have to take a look to see, did<br/>
the FAQ still direct you to do it that way?  If so, we'll have to<br/>
change that.  It's been a while since I read that.<br/>
<br/>
A great resource for you would be to look at joining another Yahoo<br/>
list that is for new letterboxers.  That's a great place to ask some<br/>
experienced letterboxers questions about the basics without having to<br/>
feel silly or wonder if that question has been asked a million times.<br/>
 It sounds as if you are trying to read up, but are finding some<br/>
contradictory information.  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/ <br/>
There are good references in the "links" section too.<br/>
<br/>
As for the store bought stamp issue--I'm not touching that one with a<br/>
ten foot pole! :)  You will find it is a very sensitive area.  Many<br/>
feel disappointed if it isn't a store bought stamp and would rather<br/>
have a very crudely carved stamp, others are just happy to have<br/>
anything to look for.  It can be a very emotional debate at times<br/>
though.  If you search the archives, you will find that debate comes<br/>
up all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome again, and I hope you enjoy the community.  It really can be a<br/>
great place to be.  I'm sure you will enjoy it--just expect a few<br/>
bumps along the way.  We are a crazy and very large group.  Sometimes<br/>
there are misunderstandings, but it is a great group of people and a<br/>
wonderful hobby.<br/>
