us newbies.  :)  We looked all over, but I missed one before, so it <br/>
could be me.  Has anyone else found it recently?  We did find some <br/>
suspiciously scattered rocks that looked a little out of place and <br/>
thought they might have been the discreet covering of a letterbox.  <br/>
Christmas Series #3, summer house and the fire tower box were all <br/>
there.  we were going to hike up to the beaver dam, but it was just <br/>
too stinkin' hot on Friday. <br/>
<br/>
What a terrific place sessions woods is.  Thanks to the planters for <br/>
leading us to such a treasure.<br/>
