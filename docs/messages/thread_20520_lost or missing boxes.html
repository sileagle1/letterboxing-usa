<br/>
It can be very frustrating to look for a box, not find it.  For whatever<br/>
reason, sometimes people do not maintain the box, and do not update the<br/>
clues.  After a few you learn  which placers have dropped out.   I am not<br/>
sure there is really anything that can be done without taking the<br/>
responsibility away from the placer, and I sure wouldn't want that!!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if finding the box is paramount to you, you can always post to<br/>
the main list or try to contact the placer before you embark and ask for  a<br/>
status report.  I have done this when traveling on occasion.  Otherwise, I<br/>
prefer to accept the gifts I receive when boxing.  Sometimes the prize is a<br/>
stamp in a plastic box; sometimes it is a few hours of solitude, or a bit of<br/>
vigorous exercise.  Lat week I saw my first Blue Heron.  It rose up out of<br/>
the water and flew a short period before settling in a nearby tree.  I was<br/>
amazed and extremely privileged to have seen this, and to be able to stand<br/>
quietly and watch it for a while. (Of course, my camera was in he car, dang<br/>
it!!)<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can let the frustration go by the wayside and truly enjoy your<br/>
adventures<br/>

Not finding a letterbox is part of Letterboxing. There may be <br/>
obscure clues that cause folks fits, but when they are finally <br/>
solved, the success can be just that much sweeter. Our first <br/>
letterbox  find required 3 trips to finally figure out that there <br/>
was a bonus box. <br/>
The feature you are writing about has been cussed and discussed more <br/>
than once on this list, and most "Placers" do not like losing <br/>
control and having arbitrary listings about their letterboxes. When <br/>
you come upon clues that seem more than just a little bit wrong, <br/>
remember the placers name, and next time you find that name on a <br/>
clue sheet you might want to pass.<br/>

Which is why all "clues" to my letterboxes on the LBNA website are<br/>
re-directs to my personal webpages.  I have a "Last Confirmed" line in<br/>
all my letterboxes.  Additionally, if someone reports one of my boxes<br/>
as missing, I'll post "Reported missing, but not confirmed by placer"<br/>
until I get a chance to get out there. (Unfortunately, now that I've<br/>
been accepted to Grad School, I have a lot less free time for<br/>
letterboxing :()  <br/>
<br/>
I recently removed a "Reported missing" from my webpage.  I had gotten<br/>
two reports that "Every Day is Earth Day" (planted on Earth Day) had<br/>
gone missing, and one report sounded like it described the right<br/>
place.  When I went to confirm, I found it intact and well-stamped!<br/>

On my clues (which reside on the LBNA site) I keep a line in there <br/>
that says last found/checked so folks know. Of course if I've <br/>
received a report that it might be missing and I haven't been able <br/>
to check on it I will put that as well if it sounds like they were <br/>
in the right place. I do often receive reports that folks couldn't <br/>
find a box when it was there though, so I can see why some placers <br/>
don't want to do this. What frustrates me is the ones where placers <br/>
aer still active and have confirmed a box is missing yet do not note <br/>
that in their clues :( It is true that the journey is a good portion <br/>
of the fun of letterboxing, but I really enjoy finding the box as <br/>
well.<br/>

number of reasons that an active boxer hasn't updated clues to note <br/>
a box is confirmed missing. The person may be traveling without <br/>
access to editing their clues. The person may be too busy with other <br/>
things to update clues. The person may have just forgotten to do it. <br/>
It certainly can be frustrating to later find that the placer knew <br/>
the box is missing but please consider that the placer has done <br/>
something for you that s/he did not have to do. Recievers of gifts <br/>
are usually wise not to specify what the gift must be.<br/>

<br/>
True.  That's why it's called letterBOXING.  The hike, scenery and<br/>
company are wonderful.  So is finding the box....but when the owner<br/>
knows for a fact the box is gone and is still an active boxer?  Sure<br/>
there are circumstances that can delay updating the clues, but keeping<br/>
updates are as important as box maintenance.  After all, you wouldn't<br/>
list a box that doesn't exist...would you? ;-)  <br/>

Or not. Don't limit your thinking to a straight forward clue leading <br/>
to a non-existant box. Cleverness abounds, there may very well be a <br/>
delightful reason for a non-existant box to have clues somewhere.<br/>

things to update clues. The person may have just forgotten to do it. <br/>
It certainly can be frustrating to later find that the placer knew <br/>
the box is missing but please consider that the placer has done <br/>
something for you that s/he did not have to do. Recievers of gifts <br/>
are usually wise not to specify what the gift must be.<br/>

An easy remedy is to contact the placer BEFORE you hunt for the box. <br/>
This way you make sure you get the most up-to-date information. Or <br/>
ask about a grouping of boxes on a regional list---someone has most <br/>
likely been to the boxes you want to hunt for and can tell you if <br/>
they are alive and well.<br/>
