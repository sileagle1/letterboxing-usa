Question: Are ink pads inside letterboxes causing moisture problems?<br/>
<br/>
I've recently found some letterboxes that I'd call "older" such as <br/>
placed in 2002.  I've noticed that those have water damage.  Now <br/>
granted they've been exposed to the elements longer but I couldn't <br/>
help but notice they had ink pads inside with them.  The ink pad is a <br/>
wet source of moisture... or the pad would be dried out and not work...<br/>
<br/>
The water damage I've seen have ranged from mild, rusty staples on the <br/>
binding of the log book, to severe where the log book actually having <br/>
some of the finder's stamps washed out.  The worst case was the wood <br/>
support on the back of the stamp was warped and with the hump it was <br/>
hard to get a full impression of the image.<br/>
<br/>
Solution: Stop placing ink pads inside the box, assume people will <br/>
bring their own.  Of course that is if my hypothosis about the source <br/>
of the moisture being the internal ink pad, not external rain.<br/>
<br/>
Moral dilemma: If I'm correct about internal ink pads causing moisture <br/>
damage should I remove any ink pads I find or should I keep them how <br/>
the original planter stocked them?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I'd say do not remove anything the placer put in the box. That's the<br/>
beginning of other possible 'improvements' that finders might think<br/>
necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a 'contact the placer' note in which you offer your<br/>
hypothesis/solution is in order.<br/>

I do not put ink pads in my boxes for a few reasons. <br/>
<br/>
For one, it can be expensive and I am cheap. <br/>
<br/>
Secondly, they take up room and I prefer to make a box as small as <br/>
possible.  To this end I even eliminate using logbooks in every box in a <br/>
series, preferring instead to have just one logbook at the end of the <br/>
series.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, here in the Mid-Atlantic region we have a freeze thaw cycle <br/>
that repeats between 20 and 30 times a winter.  Not only is this cycle <br/>
destructive to our roads, but also to ink pads in boxes.<br/>

Hi Cliff~<br/>
<br/>
  I think that rather than the in pads inside letterboxes causing moisture problems, it's more likely the elements reeking havoc!  When there are ink pads in boxes, I assume the planter did so to assure the image is transferred as intended - after all, the purple cow would hardly bring the same effect if stamped in green, now would it?  : )  <br/>
<br/>
  Another thought is that if everyone used a different color ink to stamp with, and the stamp wasn't properly cleaned after stamping (as we all know is a rare occasion), then the ink that transfers to others stamp pads could make quite a mess.  Just a thought as to why boxers might place ink pads in boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
  As for removing the ink pad from another persons box - not a good idea.  I think the box owner would much more appreciate a note expressing your concerns.  <br/>
<br/>
  OK, now LET'S BOX!!!  MayEve<br/>

&gt; Question: Are ink pads inside letterboxes causing moisture problems?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've recently found some letterboxes that I'd call "older" such as <br/>
&gt; placed in 2002.  I've noticed that those have water damage.  Now <br/>
&gt; granted they've been exposed to the elements longer but I couldn't <br/>
&gt; help but notice they had ink pads inside with them.  The ink pad is a <br/>
&gt; wet source of moisture... or the pad would be dried out and not work...<br/>
<br/>
I don't think the ink pad is the source of the moisture problems -- <br/>
but they certainly exacerbate them.  Without an ink pad, things just <br/>
get wet.  With an ink pad, everything gets stained.<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest problem with the older boxes is that nobody knew <br/>
about Lock&amp;Lock containers back then.  Lock&amp;Locks, plus a couple of <br/>
blatant copies, are about the only food container that'll seal <br/>
reliably long term.  Five years from now, I expect that boxes planted <br/>
in Lock&amp;Locks today will still be dry inside, ink pad or no.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The water damage I've seen have ranged from mild, rusty staples on the <br/>
&gt; binding of the log book, to severe where the log book actually having <br/>
&gt; some of the finder's stamps washed out.  The worst case was the wood <br/>
&gt; support on the back of the stamp was warped and with the hump it was <br/>
&gt; hard to get a full impression of the image.<br/>
<br/>
I've found several boxes where the log book had been soaked for so <br/>
long as to be unopenable.  It was basically a solid block of damp <br/>
cellulose.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Solution: Stop placing ink pads inside the box, assume people will <br/>
&gt; bring their own.<br/>
<br/>
A perfectly workable plan *if* the stamp doesn't call for some <br/>
particular ink color.  If it does, you need to provide it.  I don't <br/>
provide ink if the stamp calls for black, because I expect people <br/>
have that.  Might say the same for green, most people have that.<br/>
<br/>
I have one box that requires orange ink.  I tell people to go buy <br/>
some, since there's a Michael's within 200 yards of the box!  It'd be <br/>
kinda interesting to track the sales of orange ink at that particular <br/>
Michael's.<br/>
<br/>
One idea might be to provide a marker in the box, since they <br/>
generally have fairly secure caps -- as opposed to the sorry lids on <br/>
ink pads.  The trouble there, though, is that Marvy markers are so <br/>
%$^&amp; long!  And I never seem to get a good image using markers, they <br/>
always end up a bit blotchy.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone meets somebody from one of the ink pad companies, slap 'em <br/>
upside the head about making ink pads that aren't even close to <br/>
airtight.  I mean, what's up with that?  Isn't this a product that <br/>
obviously should be securely sealed when closed?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Moral dilemma: If I'm correct about internal ink pads causing moisture <br/>
&gt; damage should I remove any ink pads I find or should I keep them how <br/>
&gt; the original planter stocked them?<br/>
<br/>
Do NOT remove them.  Add a baggie for the ink pad itself.<br/>
<br/>
If you think the box would really be better off without an ink pad, <br/>
suggest that to the owner.  He can post a first aid notice asking the <br/>
next finder to remove the pad if he so chooses.<br/>

Perhaps there are wet boxes with pads in them, but I have seen many more dry<br/>

Totally agree!! Why bring along your own ink pads AND pay to put them into your boxes? Silly!! Boxes should consist of a log, a stamp, a disclaimer/warning and maybe a First Finders 'token/certificate'.<br/>
<br/>
We have about 35 colored "Le Plume" pens in our backpack so we can color stamps prettily. On the rare occasions we do find ink pads in Lbs, they're either cruddy, dried out, a color we don't like or, in one case contaminating the whole box.<br/>
<br/>
Leave Ink Pads OUT!! LIPO!<br/>

Question: Are ink pads inside letterboxes causing moisture problems?<br/>
<br/>
I've recently found some letterboxes that I'd call "older" such as <br/>
placed in 2002. I've noticed that those have water damage. Now <br/>
granted they've been exposed to the elements longer but I couldn't <br/>
help but notice they had ink pads inside with them. The ink pad is a <br/>
wet source of moisture... or the pad would be dried out and not work...<br/>
<br/>
The water damage I've seen have ranged from mild, rusty staples on the <br/>
binding of the log book, to severe where the log book actually having <br/>
some of the finder's stamps washed out. The worst case was the wood <br/>
support on the back of the stamp was warped and with the hump it was <br/>
hard to get a full impression of the image.<br/>
<br/>
Solution: Stop placing ink pads inside the box, assume people will <br/>
bring their own. Of course that is if my hypothosis about the source <br/>
of the moisture being the internal ink pad, not external rain.<br/>
<br/>
Moral dilemma: If I'm correct about internal ink pads causing moisture <br/>
damage should I remove any ink pads I find or should I keep them how <br/>
the original planter stocked them?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The only time I've seen an ink pad contribute to a moisture problem is if moisture gets to the ink pad and the ink pad is in the same bag as the logbook. If the ink pad and stamp are in a separate bag than the log book then there is a good chance the log book won't be damaged. <br/>
<br/>
Your moral dilemma is a simple one. The placer has paid for the ink pad in their box, there is no reason why you should remove it without their permission. If you want to use your own ink pad there is nothing stopping you, there could be variety of reasons why the placer choose to have an ink pad in their box, you can use it or not.<br/>
