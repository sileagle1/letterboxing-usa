Sunset Trails. The image will now be altered so a variation will <br/>

   Thanks to  all who came out for a fun evening. Many stopped by the <br/>
mansfield Centre General Store box after dark and had a snack for the <br/>
road too.  Thanks to all  hope to see you atthe County 4-H fair.<br/>
   Nice to meet Bill and Val from letterboxing Central hope you <br/>
enjoyed the evening.  Leader of the pack- Carol<br/>

Being fairly new to letterboxing, it was really great to find other <br/>
letterboxers to exchange stamps. The Sunset box was fun, hiking with <br/>
the group. It was nice to put names with faces!  Thank you to the <br/>
Leader of the Pack for getting us all together!<br/>

appreciated being able to meet many of the letterboxing folks<br/>
who we knew by stamp only. Nice to meet everyone and three cheers<br/>
for those who made this a success. Now we can't wait for the<br/>
fall gathering.<br/>
