                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're taking a road trip from NY to MA next week and I hope to fit in a few <br/>
LB attempts along the drive. I'll be mapping some possibilities over the <br/>
next few days, but I'd also love suggestions of kid-friendly boxes along <br/>
this general route:<br/>
<br/>
Bennington, VT to Rockport, MA along VT Rt. 9 and MA Rt. 2, then 128N to 127<br/>
<br/>
Rockport, MA through the Berkshires and on to Albany along I-90<br/>
<br/>
One McQ is not a huge LB enthusiast (though I'm working hard on <br/>
conversion), so shorter hikes are much appreciated. I know we'll try for <br/>
the Gloucester area boxes since we'll be close by. We may stop for the <br/>
Battle Trail box in Concord, too - the Minute Man National Park was one of <br/>
our favorite places to visit when we lived in the area.<br/>
<br/>
I'm very open to ideas for other boxes along the route, especially in <br/>
Vermont and the Berkshires since we've never explored these areas. General <br/>
touristy tips about places we shouldn't miss would be welcome as well <br/>
(off-list if appropriate so as not to add to list traffic).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Thanks! I just remembered that one - the clue wasn't up at the new site <br/>
when I looked this afternoon, but then I recalled someone mentioning it <br/>
on-list recently. We've actually been there a few times (but years ago) and <br/>
loved it. I think another visit is in order!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
