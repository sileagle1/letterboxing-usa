&gt;Subject: [LbNA] New Convert<br/>
&gt;Date: Sun, 15 Sep 2002 15:34:36 -0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     The hubby (DH) decided to give it a go again this past Friday.<br/>
&gt;This would be his second outing. I planned on nabbing 3 boxes<br/>
&gt;starting with Squirrels' Mystery Box. Off we went. We hunted close to<br/>
&gt;2 hours for that box. DH was bound and determined to find it. I told<br/>
&gt;him my theory of where it was(naturally it was different from his)<br/>
&gt;and we should leave to find the next two. While driving to the next<br/>
&gt;location he kept going over Squirrels clues convincing only himself<br/>
&gt;that he had been close. I still believe in my theory!<br/>
&gt;     Nabbed the second box and off to #3. This is where we stumble<br/>
&gt;across our first Benchmark. For those out there it is a survey<br/>
&gt;marker. AND yes, I know this subject belongs in the Geocaching site,<br/>
&gt;but it is pertinent to my story! DH is so excited to give me a lesson<br/>
&gt;on benchmarks. I write down all the info. on the disk so I can log it<br/>
&gt;in.  Later I find out I should have taken a picture. I don't have a<br/>
&gt;GPS to get the co-ordinates, but I can bet that Mr. Technology will<br/>
&gt;get a GPS soon!<br/>
&gt;      After finding box #3 we drove home. DH was all a twitter.<br/>
&gt;Talking about what his handle would be and how he wanted to carve his<br/>
&gt;own stamp! When I told him some people use a dremmel, well that just<br/>
&gt;fueled his fire. POWER TOOLS!!!!!!<br/>
&gt;     Back home. I go to try to log in the benchmark and can hear the<br/>
&gt;drill in the distance! Proudly he shows me his stamp. "Pretty darn<br/>
&gt;good for the first time" I tell him. "It's all in the tools" is his<br/>
&gt;reply.<br/>
&gt;     So I present to the community, Silver Fox, a new convert. I doubt<br/>
&gt;he will go with me all the time. Given a choice between swinging his<br/>
&gt;clubs and hunting for boxes, I'm sure he'd choose being with<br/>
&gt;his "peeps" on the links!<br/>
&gt;     The End<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   p.s. I recommend using the dremmel outside. My kitchen has little<br/>
&gt;rubber bits everywhere! Now, if only he could get excited on the<br/>
&gt;clean up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
MadMary, like you (as much as I love GPS), I'm inclined to think it detracts <br/>
from the hobby.  Your point about keeping it simple and inexpensive is well <br/>
made.  And if you give a coordinate as the final point, you invite the (God <br/>
love 'em) geocacheing crowd, who I suspect (not sure how to phrase this) <br/>
tend to come in droves cause its the American way...easier.<br/>
<br/>
I took from Psycomommy the main point was (appropriate) use of earth <br/>
referenced COORDINATES.  Please grant that if you can access the clues, you <br/>
generally have access to topozone.com, because the web is what ties all this <br/>
together. So I don't think accessing topozone is anymore a limiting issue on <br/>
someone than generally accessing the clues.  And besides, there is always <br/>
the good 'ol fashioned paper map that was used with coordinates long before <br/>
anyone thought of GPS.  And those USGS topographic maps on topozone are in <br/>
various public libraries, so you don't even need the web.<br/>
<br/>
And as a last, but critical thought, let's chop the letters G-P-S from the <br/>
concept COORDINATE, and you can find that coordinates are very useful clues <br/>
to guide one into the general area...if one is so inclined to use them... <br/>
and if not... so be it.  I think Psycomommy is on the trail of this one.  <br/>
Getting you to the park with a coordinate as an address won't get you to <br/>
that itty, bitty, Lb.<br/>
<br/>
I think the lesson for me, is to use coordinates to guide someone into the <br/>
general area (seemingly a turn off for many), and then to rely on 'classic' <br/>
clues for a bit of a challenge will keep down the environmental damage <br/>
around the Lb.  (Having a GPS would do you little good in this application.)<br/>
:-)<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

I'm getting a bit tired about hearing how letterboxing is low impact<br/>
because they are harder, or there are less people finding them.<br/>
<br/>
I could certainly find this letterbox near me with no problems.<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/wa/bridle.htm<br/>
<br/>
And I think it would take some time for me to find this cache:<br/>
http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=6514<br/>
<br/>
Obviously there are more people finding caches. But there are many more<br/>
caches, so it really ends up to be about the same letterbox and geocache<br/>
find ratios. Obviously since each letterbox doesn't have their virtual<br/>
counterpart, I can understand how someone would determine anecdotally<br/>
that a geocache will be found more often than a letterbox. I can't go to<br/>
letterboxing.org and see how many times the Bridal Trails letterbox is<br/>
found, because that feature isn't available.<br/>
<br/>
So everyone on this list, the first step is to consider the geocacher as<br/>
an ally, since we have the same issues (acceptance by land managers,<br/>
proper placement, etc). We've also made some long strides in getting<br/>
acceptance in many areas, and frankly have done a lot more in this arena<br/>
since our community has grown stronger than yours over the past two<br/>
years. As I've seen from the growth of this mailing list, it seems that<br/>
you are growing as well. And as a result, you will (ultimately) lead to<br/>
the same issues, and are already traveling down the same path.<br/>
<br/>
With that said, (Specifically Happy Mapper), you are suggesting to a<br/>
community of (general) technophobes to use a system that is alien to<br/>
most of them. Using the adage, "if it ain't broke don't fix it," why<br/>
bother with nearby coordinates when you can read the directions? It<br/>
seems to me that you're offering a suggestion that isn't really needed,<br/>
or wanted. If you want to create your own clues with lat/lon<br/>
coordinates, or suggest that others do so, it seems perfectly within<br/>
your toolset now. But I wouldn't expect it to be of interest to the<br/>
general letterboxing community.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">---Jeesh! I'm surprised that my little story has evolved so much as <br/>
to bring out the 2 Big Kahunas(sp) from Lboxing and Geocaching. <br/>
Believe me that was not the intent to start a dukefest between the <br/>
two.<br/>
   That being said, I have to admit that the Geocache site is one up <br/>
on the Lbox site.(I can now hear all the purist groaning) Check for <br/>
yourselves! One great feature is that you can go to the cache listed <br/>
and read who has been there before. See the troubles the cachers have <br/>
gone through to find or NOT that particular cache! I find this to be  <br/>
an excellent feature in geocaching.<br/>
    I wish it could be done in Lboxing. It would save a lot of time <br/>
going through the archives to see if the box is still there because <br/>
it was planted years ago. It also eleminates the repeat guestions on <br/>
the talk list. "Does anybody out there have any info on such and such <br/>
box?" Or HH info. I know nothing about computers so don't anyone out <br/>
there write back to me and say "yeah, Karin go ahead and set it up". <br/>
It can be done because it is offered on the geocache site.<br/>
    Respectfully to both sites,<br/>
    Psychomommy  aka Karin<br/>
    P5 F24(1 is a geocache found w/o GPS) X2 C0 V3 E(soon to be 1) <br/>
    B1(benchmark. Still having trouble logging it in. I know I found <br/>
    it that's all that matters) and the ever popular L4 (lizards)<br/>

&gt; Believe me that was not the intent to start a dukefest<br/>
<br/>
I don't see a dukefest between anyone.  Which is good, because the list<br/>
is weary of such ...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;     I wish it could be done in Lboxing. It would save a lot of time<br/>
&gt; going through the archives to see if the box is still there because<br/>
&gt; it was planted years ago. It also eleminates the repeat guestions on<br/>
&gt; the talk list. "Does anybody out there have any info on such and such<br/>
&gt; box?"<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'll groan :-)  What ever happened to going out to the box to<br/>
find out stuff about it?  What ever happened to "the point of the <br/>
journey -- is not to arrive" (and it escapes me from what song that's <br/>
from -- the first person to e-mail me off-list with the answer gets one <br/>
of my 3 yes/no hint passes :-)).  I guess people are bothered by going <br/>
out and not finding the box, which has always surprised me, since assured<br/>
success and spoilers is more boring than the thrill of discovery, IMHO.<br/>
(Ir would be a nice side effect to eliminate all the "whats the status <br/>
of this box" messages, tho ...).<br/>
<br/>
It can be done.  And it will be done someday by somebody.  And when all<br/>
the park people ban letterboxing and geocaching, the whole thing can be<br/>
done online.  You'll never even have to venture outside at all to discover<br/>
anything (because there's no reason to go there if we don't think we'll<br/>
find the tupperware) :-)  It'll be just like real treasure hunting ...<br/>
(but it is interesting to note that letterboxing has flourished elsewere<br/>
for 150 years without it ...)<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, something called "Hunted Treasures" was invented shortly after the<br/>
web, which is the equivalent of online letterboxing, and it predates <br/>
post-Smithsonian letterboxing.  I'm not sure what a "virtual letterbox"<br/>
is, but my guess is that the ideas are similar.  (I've put some hunted<br/>
treasures on my website which a handful of people have found ... :-)))<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
with apologies for the sardonic edge, but most of you are used to it ... ;-)<br/>
