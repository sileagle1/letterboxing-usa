&gt; The first letterbox in Juneau, Alaska, was planted by M. Gainey in <br/>
&gt; September 2002 at the shrine of St. Therese. The county is the City <br/>
of Juneau Borough. The box is called the Shrine of St. Therese Box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because this box is an orphan, would you be kind enough to drop me a <br/>
&gt; line at mlgainey@y... after you stamp in letting me know the <br/>
&gt; condition of the box? Much thanks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The shrine is, of course, a religious place, so please act <br/>
&gt; accordingly. I urge you to explore it beyond the clues below; I <br/>
found <br/>
&gt; it to be a calming, restorative place.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy boxing!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take Egan Drive in the direction of the ferry terminal and Auke Bay.<br/>
&gt; Keep driving toward "the end of the road."<br/>
&gt; Make a left at the sign to the shrine of St. Therese.<br/>
&gt; Take the Grotto Trail.<br/>
&gt; Take the right fork.<br/>
&gt; At the next fork, keep straight.<br/>
&gt; Cross the bridge.<br/>
&gt; Take the left fork.<br/>
&gt; Take the trail to the Merciful Love Labyrinth, the Shrine <br/>
&gt; Columbarium, and the Marian and Biblical Gardens.<br/>
&gt; Take the trail to The Gap.<br/>
&gt; Walk to the right side of The Gap.<br/>
&gt; The box is hidden in a hole in a mound across from the remains of a <br/>
&gt; twisted stump. One tall, slender tree rises up from the mound.<br/>
