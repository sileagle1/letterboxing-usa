                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello OH Letterboxers,<br/>
<br/>
     We just returned to the Pacific Northwest from our whirlwind <br/>
weekend trip to the Cincinnati area and this is what we found while <br/>
there (I'll include a status of the box if there was anything <br/>
noteworthy to report):<br/>
<br/>
-French Park (Amberly Village)<br/>
-HH 'Legends Live Forever' tribute to Dale Earnhardt<br/>
-Wetlands (Blue Ash)<br/>
-BARC n Howl (Blue Ash) was missing<br/>
-Winton Woods Kingfisher Trail (jackhammer stamp?)<br/>
-Who (Winton Woods) by Leader of the Pack<br/>
-Thunderbird (Winton Woods)<br/>
-Blue Willow (Winton Woods)<br/>
-Lost Fisher (Winton Woods)<br/>
-HH 'Where the Corn Grows' by Leader of the Pack--found at Lost <br/>
Fisher<br/>
-Fore!  by Team Jedi (WITHOUT CLUES TO THE BOX!!!--there was a hint <br/>
within the clues to Blue Willow that there was another box in the <br/>
area so we thought like letterboxes, scouted around and found it!!!)<br/>
-Great Oaks (Winton Woods)<br/>
-Wings of Peace (Winton Woods)<br/>
-Jurassic Workout 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 &amp; 8 (7 must've blown away during <br/>
the storms and could be lying anywhere in the midst of the billions <br/>
of leaves that have fallen in the area???) at Woodland Mound Park, <br/>
the logbooks are almost full on these<br/>
-Wildberrys (wow!!! is all I can say about this one!!!)<br/>
-Snowflakes (Withrow Nature Preserve)<br/>
-IScream (Mariemont)<br/>
-Dogwood Park Nature Trail (Mariemont)--didn't know there was <br/>
another LB in the area until we returned to the hotel that night so <br/>
we didn't get it<br/>
-Pigs Can't Fly<br/>
-Union Terminal, Queen City Tour<br/>
-Kentucky Crab Mystery<br/>
-Ft Wright Nature Center's Frog's Pulpit (the other one in the park, <br/>
Beat the Storm, wasn't anywhere to be found--possibly swallowed by <br/>
the tree with the hole in it?)<br/>
-Past Lives II (Stanberry Park) no luck with Past Lives III or Out <br/>
on a Limb in the same park--either it's operator head space and <br/>
timing or the boxes have been blown around in the wind or are lying <br/>
around in the woods somewhere under about 6 inches of recently <br/>
fallen leaves<br/>
-HH 'Ohio Flamingo' found at Past Lives II<br/>
-Touch &amp; Go Mystery LB (plastic bag was torn and box slightly <br/>
crushed, but otherwise dry--I'm sorry I didn't have a spare plastic <br/>
bag with me at the time)<br/>
-Columbia Pioneers<br/>
-Pioneer Cemetery<br/>
-PezBox<br/>
<br/>
We placed Groovy Bug Mystery LB today in a park in Hamilton County <br/>
and will post clues to it shortly.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, an incredible sightseeing tour of the less touristy <br/>
things around Cincinnati.  We definitely learned our way around the <br/>
area quite quickly and are very thankful that letterboxing is such a <br/>
popular pasttime in this area.  Your stamps in this area are quite <br/>
exquisite and your letterboxes are very ingenious!!!  I don't think <br/>
I've ever seen that many Mini M&amp;M containers at a grocery store <br/>
checkout aisle as I saw around the letterboxing jaunts in Cincinnati <br/>
&amp; boy, what you can do with film canisters, magnets, prescription <br/>
bottles, camouflage tape, etc.  Wow!!!  Thanks for the inspiration!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the adventure through your neck of the woods.  It <br/>
truly brightened our spirits during a quite stressful time.  Keep up <br/>
the great work and we look forward to the opportunity to find your <br/>
letterboxes in the future!<br/>
<br/>
Take care &amp; God Bless,<br/>
