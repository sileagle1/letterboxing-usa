it was placed in February, would someone please go and check to see if it is <br/>
still there?<br/>
<br/>
I received an e-mail from someone who couldn't find it, but did tell me that <br/>
the river overflowed its banks a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
If I could get a status report, that would be great!  Thank you to you all!<br/>

P.S: To Wanda and Pete who were in MD recently:  which Lighthouse box of mine <br/>
did you find?  Concord or Jones Point???<br/>
