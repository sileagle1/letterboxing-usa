Just wanted to stop lurking long enough to say "howdy."  I learned <br/>
about letterboxing by accident through another hobby group, and it has <br/>
me really intrigued.  I love hiking/backpacking, I love solving puzzles <br/>
and clues, and I love folk art, so this combination seems perfect for <br/>
me.  I haven't been able to get started yet -- I'm finishing up the <br/>
spring quarter of my doctoral program on Friday, and letterboxing is <br/>
going to be my reward (I'm taking the summer quarter off).  I really <br/>
appreciate all the tips and advice I've read on the list.  Hopefully, <br/>
I'll be able to get off to a good start.<br/>
Take care, everyone,<br/>

Well Howdy back Fly.<br/>
It probably is a good thing you haven't started letterboxing prior to <br/>
finishing up your spring quarter as you might have become addicted <br/>
sufficiently to not finish the quarter.<br/>

Hey there, welcome aboard this crazy letterboxing adventure!  Might <br/>
want to hold off on boxing til you're finished with your PhD.  <br/>
Otherwise, you may never 'finish the race'.  Thanks to letterboxing, <br/>
I've managed to procrastinate a second MS that I HAVE to get (for work) <br/>
for WAY too long.  :(  It's now getting down to the wire and I'll have <br/>
to basically knock it out in 6 months WHILE working, homeschooling &amp; <br/>
playing geographical single mom.  Can you say that every free moment <br/>
from now til my suspense will see me locked away in a room with my head <br/>
stuck in a book or my hands glued to a keyboard?  No fun!  Beware the <br/>
force of the letterboxing addiction!!!  ;)  It might be a scary scene <br/>
when folks see me 'crawl back out of my cave' in a few months once, <br/>
hopefully, I complete this program.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, thanks for the reply and the welcome.  I understand your dilemma <br/>
about school -- I've been going to school fulltime nights and <br/>
weekends while working fulltime for the past year -- but my kids are <br/>
grown, so at least I don't have to worry too much about the "mom" <br/>
stuff anymore.  You can do it, just keep your eyes on the prize and <br/>
remember that it's a time-limited commitment.<br/>
<br/>
I went letterboxing for the first time today and found three boxes, <br/>
all in the same area of a local park.  Way cool fun!  Saw some really <br/>
neat stamps -- definitely gonna have to work on mine.  I almost <br/>
got "caught" by a box that was pretty much in the open in a well-<br/>
travelled area.  An older couple was pretty suspicious of me and what <br/>
I was doing.  I just went and sat on a tree stump and acted like I <br/>
was reading my logbook until they went away.  I also went to <br/>
Michael's and got some stuff to experiment with in terms of stamp <br/>
carving.  I can see how that aspect alone could get addictive.<br/>
<br/>
I'll definitely be out looking for more boxes tomorrow -- I've even <br/>
had an idea about a series I would like to do in a local park that <br/>
doesn't yet have any boxes.  I'll have to improve on my stamp-carving <br/>
first, though.<br/>

Take care,<br/>
