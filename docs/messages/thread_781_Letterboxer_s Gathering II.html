Both of these locations sound good to me.  I've never been to Mystic and only to <br/>
Newport once, years ago.  WOuld love to go back to Newport and do the Cliff Walk <br/>
again!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Maybe late<br/>

That sounds fine.  Wow. This sounds like it's becoming a reality!<br/>

Welcome to the list.  Sounds like you've been follwing the list for a while (since your using the PFX quotients).<br/>
<br/>
What's your connection to the EMS store? Do you work there or just a regular?  <br/>
<br/>
As you probably have noticed, things develop in a rather organic fashion on the list.  Whatever our next gathering is, and it looks like we're likely to do something in your area this spring, it'll all happen on the list, so stay tuned and you'll probably know more than you wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you mentioned the EMS connection, another excellent reason to have our next gathering in that area.  It would be nice to extend the connection.<br/>

&gt;hi my name is Bob Disch and i'm a letterboxer. I just can't help my<br/>
self.<br/>
<br/>
Bob, I just LOVE it!<br/>
<br/>
Sarah is so right about EMS (I've got no commercial affiliation, but<br/>
have spent a fortune there on my compass and guidebooks, and my boss<br/>
also unloaded a bunch gifting me with one of those Suunto compass<br/>
wristwatches for Christmas...) EMS is how I heard about letterboxing,<br/>
and look what it's done to me...no, seriously, you've been great for<br/>
the area! Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Sarah and Bob, it would be great to put our heads together on this<br/>
Gathering. And I really like the idea of a local campground, but of<br/>
course am quite open to other's thoughts (I've heard alot about how<br/>
great the cozy Long Trail Inn was last time around). Maybe our Seaport<br/>
connection can get us bunks on their Tall Ship, the Henry Morgan. The<br/>
first campground that comes to mind is Devil's Hopyard, with it's great<br/>
waterfall, or maybe Arcadia? There is a terrific lean-to there at<br/>
Frosty Pond that has room for a bunch of tents. And, of course, being<br/>
New England, there are a wealth of B&amp;Bs and small inns to choose from.<br/>

are all posted at EMS..the store is inside the the Crystal Mall in<br/>
Warterford CT.  I am working on putting up a website with all my clues on<br/>
it.. The lastest one I put up was "Double Image" on 01/01/2000, My 1st box<br/>
was "Misery Loves Company" on June 1998. I owe my love for letterboxing to<br/>
Sarah..Thanks Sarah.. :)<br/>
    Sarah is the manager at our store. She also is a part of this mailing<br/>
list. I welcome the thought of a gathering in our area, please count on<br/>
myself and my lovely wife Judy for any help.<br/>
    My thanks go out to the Drew Clan, for so many wonderful boxes.<br/>

	The Seaport does have bunks on the "Joseph Conrad" but I believe the<br/>
ship is already booked for the rest of the year.  There is no visitor<br/>
sleeping on the "Charles W. Morgan", although in Jan. and Feb. the<br/>
Seaport gets a little slow and the staff on board have been know to<br/>
doze, I never have!!  As for area campgrounds, I would like to suggest<br/>
Green Falls State Park, there is already a letterbox on Green Falls<br/>
Pond. <br/>

girls dreamt of when they visited Mystic Seaport about 35 years ago!  <br/>
Seafaring is more in my blood than camping but I do believe this makes a<br/>
suitable middle berth.  Son Benjamin was just 4 months old when we<br/>
sailed up Lake Champlain, the Richelieu River and into Canada.  We saw<br/>
Moby Dick (old movie) just this past weekend.  I think there is a cosmic<br/>
connection developing here.  I vote for the Henry Morgan ...- or is this<br/>
an early April's Fool?<br/>

	Whatever the choices for accomodations, I am confident that our<br/>
organizers will recognise the preferences and economic diversity among<br/>
our group and  find a way to include all.  Thanks for organizing another<br/>
get together - the last one was great.<br/>

&gt; Sleeping on the Henry Morgan would be one of those fantasy things<br/>
little<br/>
&gt; girls dreamt of when they visited Mystic Seaport about 35 years ago!  <br/>
&gt; Seafaring is more in my blood than camping but I do believe this<br/>
makes a<br/>
&gt; suitable middle berth.  Son Benjamin was just 4 months old when we<br/>
&gt; sailed up Lake Champlain, the Richelieu River and into Canada.  We saw<br/>
&gt; Moby Dick (old movie) just this past weekend.  I think there is a<br/>
cosmic<br/>
&gt; connection developing here.  I vote for the Henry Morgan ...- or is<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; an early April's Fool?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

<br/>
Well, not an early April Fool's joke, but it was just tongue in cheek.<br/>
I think an overnight visit to that wonderful program would be fun but<br/>
would be a separate trip from the letterboxing thing. They do all sorts<br/>
of history and crafts and stuff: it's not just a place to hang out<br/>
(although we could jump in the river in lieu of Bonnie's hot tub!).<br/>
Sorry if I sent us off on a tangent with that. Still, when you're here,<br/>
there is lots to do: the Seaport, Aquarium, theater, museums, beaches,<br/>
sightseeing, casinos.... <br/>
<br/>
I'll talk with Sarah and Bob and we'll put our heads together!<br/>
