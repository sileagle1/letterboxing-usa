                    <div class="plaintext-content">TeamGreenDragon spent a wet Saturday afternoon doing the " <br/>
FireTower " , " Rattle Snake Ledge " and " The Fox " Letterboxes all <br/>
located at the Wickaboxet WMA  in West Greenwich , RI . All three <br/>
boxes are in fine shape .<br/>
On Sunday we headed just a little further West and picked up the " <br/>
Pagan Pride 2002 " box at Strathmore Park in Russell MA . While there <br/>
we couldn't help but notice Mt . Tekoa and just had to climb it and <br/>
place a box . After a strenuous climb up the side of this cliff like <br/>
hill , weren't  we surprised to find a path at the top ! <br/>
We placed the box and took the path ( a little more roundabout route <br/>
but a lot safer ) back down . We then headed for Hampden MA and found <br/>
six of the seven in the Thorton Burgess Series " Treasures of the <br/>
Forest " . The second one of these " Mother West Wind " we where <br/>
unable to locate , though we looked twice and tried reinterpreting <br/>
the clues we always came back to the same hollowed out tree and no <br/>
box . It was a great easy series to do after our climb in the morning <br/>
and I want to thank Irish Tinker for sharing it with us . All and all <br/>
it was a very nice weekend ( in retrospect the climb up Tekoa was <br/>
probably foolish , and dangerous , but we had a ball !!! ) and we <br/>
want to thank all !<br/>

Oh ya ! We left clues in the log of " Pagan Pride " for the Mt. Tekoa <br/>
box " I Think You Can , I Know You Can " and will make them public in <br/>
the future .<br/>
