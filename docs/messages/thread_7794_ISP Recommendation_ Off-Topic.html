</p><p>I realize this is off-topic and I apologize to the list, but we all have ISPs and so, by way of an answer to Mark's question, this might be of interest to others as well.
</p><p>I have had Earthlink dial-up for over three years and have had no more than a couple of minor problems. In each instance, these were resolved as a result of the first contact. Their telephone tech support for dial-up has been wonderful and wait times are relatively short compared to, say, Dell Computer (whose "world class service" is horrible and aggravating..and...and). They also have live-chat tech support on their site. The Earthlink techs actually know what they are talking about. Connection speeds are consistent and I can't remember the last time I got a busy signal. 
</p><p>Earthlink is currently still rolling out DSL nationwide as the telcos are pressured to sign 3rd party agreements with them, a slow process in some areas because the local telcos do not want the competition. 
</p><p>Hope this helps.
