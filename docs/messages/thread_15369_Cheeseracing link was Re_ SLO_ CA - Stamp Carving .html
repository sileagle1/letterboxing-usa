check out the FAQ's link on the Letterboxing site. Now that I know the <br/>
answer is non existant there on to my next stupid question....Will we be <br/>
adding this timely information to our FAQ page?<br/>
<br/>
Wish I could attend the gathering if for no other reason than to see for <br/>
myself "If the Cheese stands alone?"  ... I wonder "Who will be the big <br/>
cheese?" or for that matter "Who cut the cheese?"<br/>
<br/>
OK OK I'm going to bed but I say GO FOR IT!!!<br/>

&gt;Bigguy braved the way and asked a question.  One which I was too<br/>
&gt;cowardly to ask, and gave the uninformed letterboxing world, and this<br/>
&gt;ignorant catbead in particular, information.  Thanks.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the info!  I must confess that of all the wonderous<br/>
&gt; &gt; possibilities floating through my mind, this wasn't one of them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Such a thing could only be dreamed up at a frat party or in England I<br/>
&gt; &gt; reckon.  What was it that old song said about mad dogs and Englishmen?<br/>
