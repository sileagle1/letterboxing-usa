Hello there all, first post to list and a two week old letterboxer to boot<br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
A friend and I jaunted a bit north for a day of hiking near Killington, VT,<br/>
to hit three letterboxes which are near each other.  "Deer's Leap" we found<br/>
easily enough, but "Maine Junction" and "James P. Taylor" eluded us, even<br/>
after much backtracking and bushwhacking-thru-stinging nettles. *grin*<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone found these two boxes recetly or heard of their demise?<br/>
<br/>
We would love to search again if we can, thanks<br/>
