Don't bother H&amp;H, It's just you and me kid. Don't you hear the<br/>
crickets chirping? Every long weekend it's just me and the crickets,<br/>
everyone else is on the road headed for something fun and I'm left<br/>
here at work with no one to play with. I hear that route 70 here in MD<br/>
is bumper to bumper for about 48 miles. Guess where I'm headed when I<br/>

I'm thinking of dragging my husband out for some early morning<br/>
letterboxing here in sultry Houston, Texas.  With heat close to (or<br/>
at) 100 degrees right now, very early morning is the best time to go<br/>
letterboxing.  And, with the three-day weekend, it's a good<br/>
opportunity to get out and enjoy each day!<br/>

I'm thinking of carving a few stamps to plant, too.  I've been working<br/>

three-day weekend as well.<br/>

Then traditionally decide where to drive to for the fireworks--find parking, fight the crowds, suppress sibling squabbles, fight the traffic back out again.  Maybe "proclaim liberty throughout the land" means I could be free to use those few hours of daylight for boxing instead!<br/>

Anything related to boxing? According to the news traffic will be real bad out in Oregon and now Minnesota is having some challenges. Try to stay cool, keep dry and have fun. Oh yeah, as Mark Pepe says - Just get out there and box!<br/>

airport.  I was able to get a break away from beautiful downtown Galena <br/>
and spend some time at home, giving Rayvenmom a break from being a Mommy <br/>
all the time and I'll be departing on the evening of the 4th actually.  <br/>
Since there is only one flight a day, in and out of galena, I have to <br/>
travel the night before to catch the 8:00 am flight in from Anchorage.<br/>
