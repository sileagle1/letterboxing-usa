<br/>
I placed this box on Tuesday the 29th of January. Yesterday, the <br/>
first person to admit seeking the box found it vandalized. The <br/>
freezing precipitation that started falling Thursday was covering the <br/>
remains. It was an animal to be sure. But, with the cover replaced on <br/>
the box before it was tossed to the ground, and the hiding stones <br/>
made into a cairn, it was a human one.<br/>
<br/>
I thought the location might be risky in warmer weather, but not at a <br/>
low traffic time of year. It does not make sense that someone so <br/>
malicious would have stumbled upon the box within a day or two. I <br/>
included the usual documentation and the box was labeled externally <br/>
as well. You had to scamble down a bit to even get near the hiding <br/>
spot.  ARRRGGGHHH!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'll get over it. The thought that will carry me though is <br/>
that someone admired my first carved stamp enough to STEAL it. I <br/>
suppose there are plenty of great paintings sitting in places where <br/>
they can only be enjoyed by a few...<br/>
<br/>
I have updated the Web page to indicate the box is dead for now. I <br/>
can't bear the thought of even visiting the location at the moment.<br/>

&gt; To celebrate finding my 100th box, I hand carved my first stamp. <br/>
That <br/>
&gt; was almost enough to make me quit the sport. I think the next one <br/>
&gt; will be easier if I have more tools than just a simple Exacto knife.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, here are the clues:<br/>

&gt; Please let me know if the pictures are too slow to load over dial-<br/>
up. <br/>
&gt; I would post an image of the stamp but it is too embarrassing.<br/>
