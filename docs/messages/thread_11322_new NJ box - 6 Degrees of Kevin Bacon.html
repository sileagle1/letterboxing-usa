Kevin meets the 1st Degree Thespian in a 1990 movie in which no one was <br/>
eaten by a worm.  In Movie Intersection 1, the 1st Degree Thespian lets <br/>
Kevin know, I would like to go next.  Kevin says, Forget it.<br/>
<br/>
The 1st Degree Thespian is positively catty in Movie Intersection 2 filmed <br/>
in 1996 and promises to write to the 2nd Degree Thespian.<br/>
<br/>
The 2nd Degree Thespian is neither John Boy nor Mary Ellen, but close, in <br/>
Movie Intersection 3. In this 1994 movie, the 2nd Degree Thespian and the <br/>
3rd Degree Thespian never meet. The 3rd Degree Thespian, however, demands <br/>
You - explain yourself.<br/>
<br/>
In Movie Intersection 4 from 1988, the 3rd Degree Thespian asks the 4th <br/>
Degree Thespian, What brings you here?<br/>
<br/>
In Movie Intersection 5 (2000), the 5th Degree Thespian remembers the spicy <br/>
4th Degree Thespian vaguely.<br/>
<br/>
In Movie Intersection 6 (1999), the 5th Degree Thespian shrinks, but is <br/>
never in a scene with the 6th Degree Thespian.  There is a scene where the <br/>
6th Degree Thespian says Now, I didnt know what to do.<br/>
<br/>
In Movie Intersection 7 (1983), the 6th Degree Thespian is asked:<br/>
What is this place?<br/>
<br/>
And that, indeed, is the question.  Its not what the movie claims it is...  <br/>
(Hint: a search on the movie title might bring up a list of filming <br/>
locations.)<br/>
<br/>
At the plane (#994), drive east for 4.2 miles.  Make a right onto the dirt <br/>
road and travel .6 miles.  Walk down the trail at 290 degrees.   At the <br/>
intersection, head south for 38 paces.  On the left, find the 4 tree trunks. <br/>
  At the base, youll achieve one degree of separation.<br/>
