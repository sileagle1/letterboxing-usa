                    <html><body>Mary and I had a great weekend letterboxing.  We bagged our first and second firsts.  We were first to stamp in Floating Feather's "Round Valley Reservoir" box on Sunday (nice day, nice hike), and lucky enough to find and stamp into the mystery box "Music to My Ears" somewhere in New Jersey (neat spot)!
<br/>
<br/>We also were able to figure out where Davidson Mill Pond Park was and stamp into Boo Berry, though where Walter C. Meuly Woods is we still don't know.  
<br/>
<br/>And finally, we went back to Kennedy Park in Sayreville to found the illusive (to us) box there.  I know that we are supposed to "leave only footprints and take only photos," but we must have had a pound of clay stuck to each of our boots upon the completion of our quest.  
<br/>
<br/>All boxes were complete and in good condition ...... dry and well hidden.
<br/>
<br/>Thanks, all.
