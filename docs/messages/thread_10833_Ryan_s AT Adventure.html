&gt; &gt; Personally, I would love to see a daily diary posted online that<br/>
&gt; &gt; all of us armchair wanna-be's could read.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There will definitely be one of those on my website, although due to<br/>
&gt; the lack of Internet access on the trail, it might be "time<br/>
&gt; delayed".  Even WITH Internet access I have a bad habit of writing up<br/>
&gt; my adventures weeks or months after they actually happen!  =)<br/>

<br/>
Amanda from Seattle doesn't know it yet, but I suspect if I can't <br/>
find enough time to type in my adventure from the library (the ones <br/>
that do have Internet access typically limit it to an hour of use--<br/>
which probably wouldn't leave me much time after I check all my e-<br/>
mail!), I'll end up sending hand-written versions of my adventures <br/>
for her to type up for me.  =)<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like a neat idea to me!  =)  Perhaps I should include <br/>
information in all of the boxes I've placed about how far I've gone <br/>
that day or anything interesting to note.  Hmmm....<br/>

There is a very good site for reading peoples thro-hikes on the AT and PCT <br/>
and other long distance trails at www.trailjournals.com.<br/>
<br/>
I think people are just gearing up for another season on the trails but you <br/>
can read about completed hikes for several years.<br/>
<br/>
Some people's journals can really draw you in and if you follow in real time <br/>
it is quite an emotional event.<br/>
<br/>
If you look this up choose journals that have a lot of entries!<br/>
<br/>
They do vary, some are basic but some have a lot of insight and discriptions <br/>
of the trail and other people they meet on the way.<br/>

far to get to it? ;o)<br/>
