letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
I thought I knew right where I was going and I forgot my map at home so I<br/>
decided to try it without it. I had the directions though. As it turned out<br/>
I was wrong where I was going. But after much persistence (just plain<br/>
pigheadedness if you really want to know!) I finally found the correct<br/>
marker to proceed from on the directions. I learned my lesson though...bring<br/>
the map! A friend to box with would be good too since I did this one on my<br/>
own since my letterboxing buddies (my sons) were at school. If I had my son<br/>
with me he probably would be lecturing me about forgetting the map. ;)<br/>
<br/>
All in all a great day. I felt victorious after finding it! :)<br/>
