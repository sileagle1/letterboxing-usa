I just have a general question about the web page, and if this has  been <br/>
covered in the past please accept my apologies.  But why are  some of the counties <br/>
on the map colored green, and others are not when you  hit a state?  Does it <br/>
have to do with box count for that county, or  events held there??? Or no <br/>
reason at all???? Thanks much! The Cat's  Meow<br/>
