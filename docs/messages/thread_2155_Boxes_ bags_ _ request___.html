&gt; letterboxes in hopes of keeping water vapor out of the air.<br/>
<br/>
We had considered doing that, but also wondered how much of<br/>
a difference it would make.  Couldn't hurt, anyway...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don't know yet if it helps, but it should. I know the gel<br/>
&gt; has a limited useful life, so I intend to replace the packets<br/>
&gt; each time I visit a box.<br/>
<br/>
The useful life of silica depends on how much moisture it has<br/>
to adsorb, it doesn't actually go "bad", so in an air-tight<br/>
box they *should* last almost forever.  If even a little bit<br/>
of liquid water gets in, though...<br/>
Also, you can re-activate silica by scattering it on a cookie<br/>
sheet and putting it in your oven for a while.  You'll have to<br/>
check the brand that you get, but around 200C for an hour or<br/>
two works for most (just remember to put them in something<br/>
airtight *immediately* after taking it out of the oven).<br/>
