&gt; Subject: Chuck's Carvings The Good, The Bad, The Ugly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I personally like to view other peoples carvings. I enjoy seeing what's<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; there, especially places I will probably never go to. There have been some<br/>
&gt; posts from new stamp carvers that are concerned with the quality of their<br/>
&gt; work. I have decided to show all the carvings that I have ever put in my<br/>
&gt; boxes. All but 1 are still in use. Some are good, some are bad. They are<br/>
&gt; listed in the order that the boxes were planted. This is pretty close to<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; order that they were carved. The images appear on 2 pages of my web site.<br/>
&gt; They can be found on my letterboxing page under Chucks Carvings Page 1 and<br/>
&gt; Chucks Carvings Page 2.  I call them Chuck's Carvings The Good, The Bad,<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; Ugly.<br/>
