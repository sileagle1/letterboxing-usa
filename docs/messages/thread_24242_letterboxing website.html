My thought is, you should stick to geocaching.<br/>
<br/>
I have problems with both the site and the people that run it, but it is <br/>
free and run by a dedicated group of folks.  As the old adage goes, <br/>
don't look a gift horse in the mouth. <br/>
<br/>
So it doesn't have all the bells and whistles that the geocaching site <br/>
has, what difference does that make, so long as you can get the clues, <br/>
you can figure the rest of that out on your own.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've done my share of venting. The LBNA powers-that-be want the site to be a depository - a storage facility for clues, with very limited bells &amp; whistles. Since Atlas Quest http://www.atlasquest.com has come into being, I have come to accept the LBNA depository philosophy - it supplies a niche for people who like things low-tech and bare bones and hider-centric. I will check LBNA to see if anyone in my area has posted on the site but I use AQ 98% of the time. It is an alternative site which takes advantage of web technology.  I also find that AQ provides a nice balance of hider-centric and finder-centric features.<br/>
<br/>
    Some of the features that I like on AQ include:<br/>
<br/>
  Show "all finds"<br/>
  - shows a list of all posted finds and attempts with dates and who found/attempted them <br/>
  - the all finds/attempts list helps seekers make a more informed decision about whether they want to search for a particular box <br/>
  - the finds/attempts feature can not be disabled by the owner (at LBNA the find/attempt log can be disabled by owners)<br/>
<br/>
  Keep a record of all your finds<br/>
  - premium membership allows AQ members to record all finds whether they are posted in AQ or elsewhere (LBNA, geocaching.com, WOM, a personal website, etc)<br/>
<br/>
  Yearly adoption procedure<br/>
  - helps deal with the abandoned boxes problem<br/>
  - all boxes that don't have an owner who has logged into AQ for one full year, are put up for adoption. Less than 1% of the boxes on AQ fit this description, and as long as the owner logs in once a year, their boxes won't go up for adoption<br/>
<br/>
  Boards<br/>
  - lots of great discussion boards<br/>
  - ask a question and you can expect to get an answer within minutes<br/>
<br/>
  I'm a geocacher too. I'm a big fan of the database.  I post most of my letterboxes on the geocaching.com site. I also cross post them to AQ and LBNA. Here's an example:<br/>
  http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=36061<br/>
<br/>
  Give AQ http://www.atlasquest.com a try and see if it more along the lines of what you're looking for in a letterboxing database.<br/>
