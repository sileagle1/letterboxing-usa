<br/>
I think this is my favorite letterbox of all time. <br/>
<br/>
Great planting site, great stamp, and great clues, Ryan! Hope to see some more like this from you. My boxing companion has already sworn to plant a box with you in mind sometime in the near future, although I'm not sure if that was a promise or a threat, you weren't exactly our favorite person at about 1pm yesterday...:)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, you really got hopping on that mystery box!  I'm impressed that <br/>
you found it so quickly--especially if it took *several* hikes to <br/>
find it.  (For the rest of you out there, one is all that's REALLY <br/>
necessary.  *wink*)  You'll have to send me e-mail and let me know <br/>
all the other places you hiked.  I'm kind of curious where else my <br/>
clues might have taken you.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, thanks for your encouraging post.  It feels great knowing <br/>
somebody enjoyed the hunt as much as you did, and it makes hiding the <br/>
letterbox worth the effort.  Perhaps I'll plant a "sequel" soon.  <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm....  I'm not sure I'd want to look for a box planted <br/>
specifically with ME in mind....  ;o)<br/>
