<br/>
After three visits I have discovered the true mystery of the Stacks <br/>
House Letterbox.  Does it really exist?<br/>
<br/>
Visit Number One:  After some extensive research we found what we <br/>
were quite certain was the right place to look.  The next day we <br/>
visited it over lunch hour.  There seemed innumerable good hiding <br/>
places though nothing in the clues revealed exactly where.  <br/>
Surreptitiously we inspected cabinets, corners and little hiding <br/>
places.  No luck.  Finally we carefully asked someone there.  We <br/>
remembered that the Smithsonian microbox went missing when someone <br/>
very UNdiscretely asked about it.  We carefully asked someone, "Do <br/>
you know what a letterbox is?"  "No.  Never heard of it."  We asked <br/>
if she knew an Amy.  "Oh, yes she works nights."  Finally we talked <br/>
to the person who might be Marcus but without saying the word <br/>
letterbox.  No luck from this fishing.  We decided to go home and <br/>
write the placer.<br/>
<br/>
We wrote the placer who kindly responded that, "Yes you have to ask <br/>
but not those you did since they wouldn't know anything."  She said <br/>
to ask someone like Marcus.<br/>
<br/>
Visit Number Two:  All we had to do was ask the someone like Marcus.  <br/>
Great.  Back we went over lunch hour again.  We asked the one like <br/>
Marcus.  He wasn't Marcus and he had no idea what we were talking <br/>
about, but he'd ask Amanda.  Marcus would be working tonight though.  <br/>
While waiting for Amanda we asked someone else, also no luck.  Amanda <br/>
came over.  "Hi, we are looking for the Stack House letterbox which <br/>
we understand is kept _____."  "Oh, I know about that.  But I don't <br/>
know where it is.  I'll look for it for you."  She left.  And she <br/>
never returned.  Having twice heard that Amy and Marcus worked at <br/>
night we ran out of time and decided to return that night.<br/>
<br/>
Visit Number Three:  As we sat down we heard someone saying hello to <br/>
Marcus.  Great.  Here is Marcus our troubles are over.  "Hello Marcus <br/>
we are looking for the Stack House letterbox which we understand is <br/>
kept _____."  "Oh, I know about that.  It's in the office.  But the <br/>
office is locked and I don't have a key."  Argghhhhhhh!  We spent the <br/>
next hour listening to some very good music.<br/>
<br/>
So far we have actually had quite a good time on our visits because <br/>
the place is good to visit letterbox or no.   But I am convinced <br/>
there is no letterbox.  It must simply be a conspiracy to get you <br/>
visit.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
1.  Most people there don't know what we're talking about.<br/>
2.  Those that sort of do say we have to speak to someone who's not <br/>
there.<br/>
3.  When we return, that someone says it's locked away, we'd have to <br/>
try a different time.<br/>
4.  What will it be next time?  "Sorry, someone got here before you <br/>
and took it out.  This is reminding me of Monty Python's "The Cheese <br/>
Shop".  "Sorry, we're fresh out of that one."<br/>
<br/>
Evasive?  Uh huh.  It doesn't exist.  That's what I say.  Mystery <br/>
solved!<br/>

We have actually had a good time at the place (more than I can <br/>
tell).  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could find an appropriate decorative container to hide it <br/>
in plain sight in.  After all we were looking in the cabinets.  ;-)<br/>

want people "poking around" inside all of the decorations.  I just<br/>
chatted with Celtic Pride #2, and we thought that maybe we could<br/>
velcro something to the register as to avoid this type of mishap. <br/>
I'll let you know when we have a suitable arrangement.<br/>

P.S.  I'm glad you had a great time there...I've also had quite a few!<br/>
