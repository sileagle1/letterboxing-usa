other. The bad news is, the digital recorder I use to compose my clues <br/>
stopped working before I could get all the clues off. I'm only using <br/>
tape cassettes from now on. I'm trying to find a place to get it fixed <br/>
or hopefully retrieve the data. Meanwhile, I was able to finish the <br/>
clues for the Georgetown Branch Trail Letterbox in MD. See what's new. <br/>
As well as a companion ride down through Rock Creek Park in DC. I <br/>
forgot to bring an extra box, so this is strictly for bikers until I <br/>
can get a box hidden there. I was also able to replace the BWI Trail <br/>
Letterbox outside of Baltimore, but have to wait to retrieve the <br/>
clues. The other Letterboxes I can't finish up yet are located on the <br/>
B &amp; A Trail in MD and the Anacostia Trail System in MD. If there are <br/>
any digital geniuses out there who know how I can retrieve data from a <br/>
digital mini-recorder, email me off site.<br/>
Thanks, Bill &amp; Craig<br/>
