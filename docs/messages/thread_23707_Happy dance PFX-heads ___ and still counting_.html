                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're excited to hear that several people around the country, including those from a <br/>
couple of newly represented states, have been reaching PFX milestones recently, and we've <br/>
finally gotten around to adding their names to our PFX club lists!  Newcomers to <br/>
letterboxing may not realize that the tradition of keeping a PFX count, and even of getting <br/>
patches to commemorate certain milestones, was something that started well before we <br/>
ever became involved in this hobby. We were, however, the first ones - long before some <br/>
people started logging or managing their boxes on LbNA or Atlas Quest -  to maintain a <br/>
chronological listing on our website of people as they reached PFX 500 and subsequent <br/>
milestones, starting with that first  little "poem" of mine from 5 years ago! (message <br/>
#7772 on the "big list"). Anyway,we just thought we'd let folks out there know, in case <br/>
they hadn't yet heard or had forgotten about this. that we are still happy to list those who <br/>
reach PFX 500 or more on our web page. Just let us know about when you reached a <br/>
particular milestone, and we'll be glad to add your name and date. (We might have to <br/>
check your credentials, though, if you say your name is Mr Pujeh!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
As for those recent additions, our PFX 500 list now includes the Knights of Colombo from <br/>
VA,  Lock Wench from NY,  Eidolon and Artemis from GA, and Aili and Bruce from CT!  <br/>
Please take a look at the "PFX Clubs" section of our web page at http://alum.wpi.edu/<br/>
~p_miner/Letterboxes.html,   and let us know about making any other additions, <br/>
corrections, or whatever!  And let's not forget about those two CT teachers and <br/>
letterboxing "super-achievers", Bluebird (Debby) and Music Woman (Pam), who both <br/>
recently reached PFX 5000!!!  These gals are well known locally for always being "hot on <br/>
the trail of a good mystery", too, so we are especially looking forward to seeing what <br/>
Bluebird and FishorMan have in store for us  at the "gathering of mysteries" tomorrow in <br/>
Killingworth, CT! <br/>
<br/>
As far as our own letterboxing adventures, we've been taking it sort of easy lately between <br/>
heat waves and my being bitten by a dog recently while letterboxing up in the mountains <br/>
of NH!  Personally, I'm trying not to take on any extra new goals for the moment. I had <br/>
considered setting a goal for myself of doing a "decade of 25,000 letterboxes", to go <br/>
along with my earlier "decade of 25,000 miles of solo long-distance backpacking" ( 5 AT's,  <br/>
3 PCT's, the CDT, and many, other trails that I backpacked mostly in the '80's and '90's <br/>
and that I'll have to get Pete to list on our web page one of these days before I  forget <br/>
them all!) Anyway, I had thought that surely collecting 25,000 letterboxes would be much <br/>
easier than carrying a full backpack up and down the backbones of America's toughest <br/>
mountain trails for over 25,000 miles, but what with the price of gas for driving all over <br/>
going almost continually uphill and me going mostly downhill, I just might have to give up <br/>
that  particular long-term letterboxing goal!However, I am glad that over a month ago now <br/>
I reached the point of having found over 10,000 "traditional letterboxes", so that even <br/>
without counting a single hitchhiker, personal traveler, event stamp, table topper, cootie, <br/>
PLB, virtual box, or any of the other things that some people  count, I  can now say that I <br/>
have now gone well over the F 10,000  mark with no "fillers" whatsoever! <br/>
<br/>
The main point I want to make here now, though, is that, however people may count their <br/>
letterboxing plants and finds, I'm just glad that so many people out there still do take the <br/>
time to do that. Not that it takes much time, really. Anyone who has taken the time to <br/>
count out 500 paces or so to find a CT State Forest DEP letterbox knows that it takes <br/>
about the same amount of time to count off 500 paces as it does to count through  500 <br/>
letterbox stamp images, namely, about 10 minutes!!!  Even for us to go back through and <br/>
count all of our thousands of stamp images would only take a couple of hours, so it's <br/>
definitely not an issue of time!  For those who don't want to keep track of their numbers, <br/>
for whatever other reasons, that's fine, but for those who do count, here's a little  bonus - <br/>
no bells or whistles or trophies or badges, just a cute little line of happy dancing PFX-<br/>
heads holding a banner that says "We Count, Too!" So, whether your count is 1 or 1001, all <br/>
you have to do, when you see us, is tell us you count, <br/>
and, to quote Mr. Pujeh,  you will "increase your PFX count by at least one"!<br/>
And please feel free to read the little poem that I wrote to go along with this stamp (P161) <br/>
in the "Clues" section of our web page,  too, if you get a chance!<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations once again to all those reaching PFX goals, and hope you all keep on <br/>
happy 'boxing, and counting if you can!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just had to say how nice it was to get e-mail from folks all around <br/>
the country about how they enjoy keeping track of their PFX counts! <br/>
It seems like keeping track of things like that is a natural part of <br/>
human nature, and I was sad to hear that some people felt bullied <br/>
into thinking that they shouldn't do it! The only problem seemed to <br/>
be distinguishing between STAMPS and FINDS, and all I can say to <br/>
that is that we call it "PFX" (NOT "PSX"!) for a reason. It seems to <br/>
me that letterboxing is about FINDING BOXES, and not about how many <br/>
pretty stamps, from whatever source, one accumulates in logbooks - <br/>
otherwise our hobby would quickly degenerate into mere "stamp <br/>
collecting"! (People could just go to the stamp store or the post <br/>
office or whatever, if all they were interested in were the "stamps" <br/>
and not the actual experience of doing the "finds" which to me <br/>
constitute the true essence of "letterboxing"!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, however you count, we hope to have the "Happy Dancing PFX-<br/>
heads" available at all the upcoming gatherings we are planning to <br/>
attend, so just come up and tell us you count to get the stamp! <br/>
Almost everyone at the recent "Gathering of Mysteries" in CT signed <br/>
in and wrote down their PFX counts, too! We were also thrilled that <br/>
virtually everone there signed on for that "Magical Mystery Cruise" <br/>
we mentioned in our last post, too, so please feel free to go back <br/>
and search that post if you want more information on the next "port <br/>
of call". And even mapsurfer's "LbNA 500" box turned up again - it <br/>
seems that some folks just couldn't quite wait their turn to get <br/>
that stamp and then forgot that others in line ahead of them might <br/>
have been waiting, but that's just part of human nature, too. Now <br/>
let's just back out to the "fun of the hunt"!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
