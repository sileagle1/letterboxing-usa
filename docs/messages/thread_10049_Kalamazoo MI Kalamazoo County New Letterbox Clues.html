<p align="center"><strong>KAZOO DOG'S E-Z LETTERBOXES</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Asylum Lake Preserve</strong></p>
<p align="left">Placed by Kazoo Dog with help from Golden Retrievers Triscuit &amp; Dewar</p>
<p align="left">Placed on January 3, 2003</p>

<p align="left">Asylum Lake Preserve, owned by Western Michigan University under an agreement between the University and the City of Kalamazoo, is a 274-acre parcel of land that contains the remnants of an oak savanna and is especially interesting in having been first owned by the first black residents of the Kalamazoo area, Enoch and Deborah Harris, who were known to have participated in the Underground Railroad. The land was purchased by the Michigan Asylum for the Insance in 1887, which accounts for the unusual name of this urban preserve. There are no entry fees to this preserve, which is a very popular area with several entrances.</p>
<p align="left">For more information: <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/environmental-studies/drew/asylum.htm">http://www.wmich.edu/environmental-studies/drew/asylum.htm</a></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<p align="left">Asylum Lake Preserve can be reached from Stadium Dr. in Kalamazoo by turning south onto Drake Rd.; Drake Rd. is less than a mile east of US-131 (Refer to your road map.). There is a small parking lot about 0.25 miles on the left as well as other entrances to the preserve further south on Drake Rd. and east along Parkview Ave. For this outing, park at the first Drake Rd. lot south of Stadium Dr.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Clues:</strong></p>
<p align="left">Once parked, go through the cyclone fence opening near the northern end of the parking area. Although the trail is not marked, it is easily followed downhill with Asylum Lake visible on the left. Near the bottom of the trail, take a moment to sit in the tree stump chair to listen for birds, the wind in the trees and even the sound of city traffic that has grown fainter with each step on the trail. Continue along the trail a short distance until you come to the place where you'll see three tall leaners and still others leaned so far that they now permanently rest on the ground. Follow the trail that keeps those three leaners between you and the lake. As you being to climb upward, you'll see a green post to the west of the trail. Just pass it by, for soon you'll reach a fork in the trail where you'll be right not to go left. Enjoy this relatively flat portion of the trail until you reach the place of three choices. Even those not of "right mind" should choose this trail, which ends at an unpaved roadway. Follow the roadway left until you come to some rusty white posts that form a fence along either side of the road. Here you'll see the lake again. Take the trail past the water, keeping it to your right. As you ascend this trail and get nearer the top, a portion of the lake will seem to form a bowl as two peninsulas nearly meet each other. From here, on the left side of the trail just ahead, you'll see a large fallen tree, its origin next to the trail, that left an earth bowl where the tree once stood. About 7 paces* into the rather dense thicket beyond this bowl, you'll see a tree trunk about 3' in diameter and maybe 3-1/2' long, obviously cut by man and left on its side to decay. Work your way to that log and then take about 17 paces as the crow flies (if you can stay straight and narrow in this area) in the same direction up the hill to the large upright tree stump that is perhaps 2' tall. Go to that hollow stump to find a letterbox resting inside. You may want to return to the path and sit on the large fallen tree to do your stamping if there is heavy trail traffic. Once you've returned the box to its resting place, return to the trail and continue ascending it to the top where it curves left. Soon you'll come to another fork in the trail. If you take the trail that leads right, you'll be retracing your steps downward to the place of the leaning trees and ultmately back up the trail to the parking lot. Especially if you have dogs that you allowed to run free, stop again at the stump chair and leash them before continuing up the trail; the parking area isn't far and is very close to a busy 4-lane road.</p>
<p align="left">*Note: As a short-legged hiker, I suspect one of your paces may equal two of mine.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Caution:</strong></p>
<p align="left">In wet or snowy weather, portions of this trail can be treacherously slippery, for all the trails are thick with fallen oak leaves and can be ice-covered as well in winter. Although ascents and descents (and there are several) are not all that steep -- even for this 71-year-old woman -- your 'tush migh contact the ground if you're not careful...and I do speak from experience. </p><p><br/></p><hr size="1"/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>

Geez!! Also, I inadvertantly used the wrong e-mail address in sending my 2nd set of clues for the second letterbox I placed (Al Sabo Land Preserve). I think both Prairie View Park and Asylum Lake Preserve went through okay. I'm again submitting my clues for Al Sabo and will be very careful so as not to fould up again:</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Al Sabo Land Preserve</strong></p>
<p align="left">Placed by Kazoo Dog with help from Golden Retrievers Triscuit &amp; Dewar</p>
<p align="left">Placed on January 2, 2003</p>
<p align="left">Kalamazoo, Michigan</p>
<p align="left">Kalamazoo County</p>
<p align="left">Easy to Moderate Hiking (depending on weather/trail conditions)</p>
<p align="left">The 741 acres of the Al Sabo Land Preserve is a City of Kalamazoo Preserve, established in the early 1970s to protect the groundwater supply of the Atwater wellfield. This preserve contains a diverse mix of woods, wetlands and open meadows. There are 25 miles of trails within the preserve, about 7 of which are open to bicycles. There are no entry fees to this preserve, which is very popular with hikers, cross-country ski enthusiasts and bicyclists.</p>
<p align="left">To learn more, visit: <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/environmental-studies/drew/alsabo.htm">http://www.wmich.edu/environmental-studies/drew/alsabo.htm</a></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<p align="left">Al Sabo Land Preserve can be reached from Stadium Dr, Kalamazoo, MI, by turning south onto Drake Rd. Take Drake Rd. to Parkview Ave., turning right onto Parkview. Go over the overpass and turn left onto 12th Ave. Continue on 12th Ave. to the 4-way stop at Texas Dr.; turn right onto Texas Dr. The preserve is 1.25 miles on Texas Dr., right side of the road. There is no sign for the preserve, so look for the orange entry gates. If you pass the Camp Roti-Kiwan sign on the right (the camp entrance is adjacent to the preserve entrance), you just missed the preserve! There is free parking. Those from outside Kalamazoo can reach Stadium Dr. from US-131.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Clues:</strong></p>
<p align="left">Once parked, proceed to the inner orange trail gate by the preserve information sign where you'll find a trail that leads immediately right. Follow this trail, which goes through a pine grove that leads to a fork in the trail where there is a marker post. Follow the orange arrow, which is off-limits to bicycles. This trail, with no markings, meanders through a pine forest (take time to enjoy the wonderful aroma) and seems to be one that even a novice can follow naturally, even without signs. Follow this natural pathway that, at one point, seems to break into a somewhat mixed group of trees; don't get worried, though! Continue to follow this unmarked path that will again become largely pine forest. Just when you get bit worried about being on the right trail, you'll see your second orange marker. After that, you'll pass by many downed trees, most of them on your left. Soon you'll spot a tree with a green metal marker and then a second. After the second tree, you'll come to a cross trail, marking a bicycle trail, beyond which you'll see another orange marker as well as a green marker. Keep going! At the 5th green metal marker, proceed right into the woods, hiking up toward a natural ridge; about 30 paces* or so past the marked tree, you'll surely spot a very large oak tree (not to be confused with an even larger oak that lies deeper in the woods (southeastly). Near the top of the ridge and about 13 paces before you reach this first oak tree, you'll find some fallen trees that form a "Y" on the ground. Near the place where the "Y" is a "V", you'll find the letterbox.</p>
<p align="left">*Reminder: I'm a short-legged person; two of my paces may equal just one of anyone else's. In addition, there are many shrubs, small trees and brush here, so you won't be able to make a "bee line" to the oak tree or the alphabet tree. After finding the letterbox, you may wish to proceed along the trail not yet traversed or to retrace your steps back to the parking lot.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Caution &amp; Notes:</strong></p>
<p align="left">In icy or wet conditions, this trail can become quite slippery with ice, mud or wet fallen leaves. The trail is a good one for cross-country skiers or snowhoe aficionados in the right snow conditions. Those with dogs will enjoy these trails at all seasons -- and are reminded to clean up their dogs' droppings.</p><p><br/></p><hr size="1"/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>
