Hi all!  How does one go about getting the letterbox data base posted <br/>
by hexacat in the files section of the website?  I clicked on it and <br/>
was able to see some neat things, but cannot figure out how to access <br/>
them or download them.  Are they available?  Cap'n Rasha<br/>

Hello -<br/>
Quite some time ago, most people decided to move on from the format of<br/>
a database. In it's true definition, it's just a listing - which is no<br/>
different than that offered by AQ or LBNA. I think Choi has done a<br/>
fantastic job of making the option available to list the clue/box status.<br/>
<br/>
It is up to letterboxers to decide how they want to present their<br/>
clues and whether or not they maintain the status of their boxes on<br/>
the clue now. This means that maintaining a database where someone has<br/>
to manually input each and every time they find a box is an<br/>
inefficient method of tradking the current letterbox status.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, I suggest you contact the person who placed to box to<br/>
verify that the box is active or talk with others on a regional list.<br/>
I find that is far more helpful than pleading with webmasters to<br/>
create some list that you ultimately don't have control over.<br/>
<br/>
As a letterbox placer you can be responsible for your box status.<br/>
As a letterbox FINDER it is also up to you to determine whether it's<br/>
active or not before you search. <br/>
