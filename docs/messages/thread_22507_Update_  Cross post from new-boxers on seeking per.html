Commissioners regarding permissions to place boxes for a series I <br/>
have in mind. Chester County Parks has already granted permission to <br/>
place in County Parks to several folks, so there is a precedent set. <br/>
Where we want to place some boxes will cover a variety of <br/>
jurisdictions, so we decided to go to the top to a commissioner we <br/>
know - his secretary was very excited about it and said that she <br/>
thought it would be a great idea and would get to work on it right <br/>
away. And, if you know anything at all, it's the staff <br/>
administrative assistants who do all the work anyway! We'll keep you <br/>
posted.<br/>

&gt; Hi All-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay, I'm a newbie.  I've read a lot of posts on the lbna and lbma <br/>
&gt; lists as well as this one, but I haven't seen a lot about this <br/>
&gt; subject, and I'd like to get everyone's opinion:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Should you get permission from the landowner (i.e., government <br/>
owned <br/>
&gt; public lands) prior to placing a box?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or should you have a don't ask, don't tell philosophy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My gut feel says to ALWAYS get permission to do something like <br/>
this -<br/>
&gt;  without trying to be self-righteous about it, it just seems like <br/>
&gt; the right thing to do.  But the other half of my brain says why <br/>
&gt; bother - you're not going to hurt anything, you're going to take <br/>
&gt; care of the box, and only boxers are likely to find it, so what <br/>
&gt; difference does it make whether some county commissioner or park <br/>
&gt; superintendent knows and approves of what I'm doing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I live in Pennsylvania.  The state Dept of Natural Resources has a <br/>
&gt; policy ( http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/geocaching.aspx ) and my <br/>
County <br/>
&gt; Parks also approve ( Chester County Permission for Boxes.doc in <br/>
lbna <br/>
&gt; files list).  But here in PA, we have townships, county roads, <br/>
&gt; boroughs, cities, and who knows who else is interested.  My wife <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; I want to place some boxes around the county on public property <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; know that they would be properly maintained, but feel responsible <br/>
&gt; enough to ask first.  I spent all afternoon yesterday preparing <br/>
&gt; letters to officials seeking their policies: a township park, a <br/>
&gt; privately owned, but publicaly accessible nature preserve, and to <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; county commissioner asking just who should I ask to place a box <br/>
&gt; around a covered bridge - don't know who's responsible for it, but <br/>
&gt; the commissioner's name is on the plaque.  These three are GREAT <br/>
&gt; places for boxes, but I'm concerned that I'm not going to get <br/>
&gt; permission.  THEN what do I do?  I don't just want to place boxes <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; some of the same places others in my county have done, but I'm <br/>
&gt; unsure whether they bothered to get permission or not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hopefully, this will generate some debate.  And if it's been <br/>
debated <br/>
&gt; in length before, please don't flame me, I just haven't decided <br/>
&gt; completely yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thanks,<br/>
