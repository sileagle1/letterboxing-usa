Norfolk, CT.  Litchfield County<br/>
Planted 8-8-02 by the Bonnie and Clyde gang<br/>
Short, easy, but with a climb.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is located at the Haystack Mountain State Park in Norfolk, CT.  Norfolk is a quaint village-like town nestled in the Litchfield Hills.  As you drive into the center of town on RT 44 West, you will see Haystack Mountain with its distinct observation tower ahead of you.  Proceed north on RT 272 from the center of Norfolk and the entrance to the Park is soon on your left.  A nice paved road allows you to drive up a good distance.  Drive to the end and park.  <br/>
<br/>
Take the only trail from the parking lot up.  Enjoy a fairly level beginning because soon you will weave and meander up, following the yellow blazes and wishing you hadn't eaten that extra donut that morning.  The light forest of mountain laurel and oak and pine will keep you cool as you step up and up and arrive at the top.<br/>
Enjoy observing the observation tower for now, because due to roof reparations, you unfortunately can't enter this wonderful stone edifice.  Hopefully the state of CT will find the funds to restore the roof soon!  <br/>
