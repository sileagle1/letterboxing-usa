blocks off one of the trails in my clues. I guess the fence is to keep dogs from falling over the edge of <br/>
the cliff overlooking the river. Dogs should not be off leash in this part of the park anyway, so I am a <br/>
quite frustrated that the park board has defaced this "natural" area with a really long ugly chainlink <br/>
fence. This park has gotten more and more busy since I first started hiking there so its now drawn the <br/>
attention of park-board bureacrats. Even though I dislike all the new traffic, I'm probably not helping <br/>
much by publicizing the place on the internet! Its still one of my favorite places to hike in <br/>
Minneapolis, the site of the earliest European settlement in Minnesota and also ancient Native <br/>
American villages.<br/>

NEW CLUES:<br/>
Rock of Racial Harmony Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
The Rock of Racial Harmony is an immense boulder in a meadow atop a cliff overlooking the <br/>
Mississippi River south of 54th Street.  <br/>

If you are a dog lover, bring your dog along when looking for this box, but please follow the rules of <br/>
the dog park posted at the entrance! If you are not a dog lover, be warned that many people do not obey <br/>
the rules and allow their dogs to run free in this area -  so keep alert!<br/>
