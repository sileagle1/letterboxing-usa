                    <div class="plaintext-content">--- In letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com, michael smith &gt; That sounds <br/>
fun... we went to find the "fab four" in Essex last week and couldn't <br/>
seem to find the "castle rock" or the "geodetic marker" boxes.. any <br/>
more clues?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Ironic, isn't it, that the letterbox for Paul has turned out to be <br/>
the hardest? And not just for you, Michael. Most folks dismissed <br/>
McCartney as the cute one, without the stunning musicality of Lennon <br/>
or the mysticism of Harrison, and lacking the randy bluecollar appeal <br/>
of Starr. Yet he lives in estate on the Scottish coast, a member of <br/>
the Forbes Richest, successful in marriage and parenthood and in <br/>
supporting his partner's heroic fight against cancer, and was <br/>
knighted by the Queen. It turns out that there are several geo-<br/>
markers in the area although only one is indicated on the trail map, <br/>
which makes finding Sir Paul a challenge. We had changed the clues a <br/>
bit, but a lovely letterboxer a half generation older than I <br/>
convinced us to leave them as-is. Paul, it turns out, was never dead <br/>
despite all the bizarre historical evidence to the contrary. The box <br/>
fits the story...Jay in CT<br/>

Adobe Acrobat).<br/>
