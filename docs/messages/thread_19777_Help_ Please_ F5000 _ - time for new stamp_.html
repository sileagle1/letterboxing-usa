don't quite know what to do about it! For so long now, in all those <br/>
hundreds of logbooks and exchanges, we've been using those same 3 <br/>
little tiny trees and "Mr. Sunshine" - part of a set that we bought 4 <br/>
years ago when we were first introducing some other people to <br/>
letterboxing - that it will be kind of hard to part with them! <br/>
However, Pete has been saying for quite some time now that we should <br/>
get something new when we reached 5000, so we've agreed to throw it <br/>
out to the "letterboxing public" to help us decide just what!<br/>
<br/>
First of all, pretty much everybody knows by now that what we're into <br/>
is the hiking aspect of this hobby, and not particularly the carving <br/>
or stamp-collecting part! Even though 90 of our 100 planted boxes <br/>
have hand-carved stamps, ours are surely not the sort to be valued <br/>
by "stamp conniosseurs", so we certainly don't want to take a chance <br/>
on carving our own "sig"! (In fact, I even felt a bit hurt, in <br/>
response to commenting on not getting a credit for our "Sunny Message <br/>
in a Bottle", with my poor little sun stamp tacked on the end of the <br/>
cork in the photo in the back of Randy's letterboxing book, when Pete <br/>
said, "are you sure you'd even want to lay claim to THAT thing!" :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we figured it would be much better if someone else carved a <br/>
sig stamp for us. We know there are so many terrific carvers now all <br/>
across the country  that we would be absolutely thrilled if any of <br/>
you would be willing to take on the challenge of creating a new sig <br/>
stamp for us! We'd sort of like to stick to the theme of 3 trees and <br/>
a sun that we started out with, but certainly any variation on that <br/>
theme would be greatly appreciated! If we get several people to carve <br/>
us sig stamps (we do already have one potential volunteer from Maine, <br/>
and I just saw an adorable mystery stamp in Pete's logbook last night <br/>
that I'd absolutely love to have had as a "sig" if it weren't already <br/>
spoken for! :-), we'd be glad to either alternate sig stamps as we <br/>
travel around, use your stamp when we visit your state, or maybe even <br/>
plant as part of a nation-wide series or something! Please let us <br/>
know  your thoughts, if there's any interest in helping us out with <br/>
this project, or if you think we should just keep using our <br/>
old "stand-bys" until they completely wear out, or roll away once <br/>
again into some "bottomless pit"!<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, thanks so much for all the nice responses to Pete's post <br/>
about my F5000 trip to Maine (from which I'm still recovering!:-) It <br/>
certainly is wonderful to know we have so many well-wishers in this <br/>
great little hobby! Cheers to all of you!<br/>

Shhhhh! We're keeping it "under wraps" (or "in the box":-) for now, <br/>
but we are thrilled to have gotten a couple of excellent sig stamp <br/>
carving offers!  Please let us know off-line if anyone else might be <br/>
interested in doing a carving for us, as we'd be more than happy to <br/>
put any stamps we get to good use!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
