Quinnipiac Linear Trail
<br/>Wallingford , Ct   [New Haven County]
<br/>Planted Sept 24, 2001
<br/>By Butterfly
</p><p>LIGHT THE WAY   letterbox has been planted in honor of the
Labyrinth in Wallingford ,Ct.
<br/>Walking a Labyrinth can be a metaphor on life,~ a joyful journey,~a
spiritual experience, ~ and a lovely walk, each time different.
<br/>To walk the Labyrinth and find the letterbox use the directions to
the Linear Trail posted with the <i>Double Happiness </i> clues.
<br/>Follow the paved path east , soon the Labyrinth comes into view on
your right. Continue on over a small bridge and pass a bench , then soon 
stop to read the plaque about the Emerson Leonard Wildlife Sanctuary .As
the trail curves this way and that, several small trails spin off on your
right. Stay with the main trail until you notice both a split rail fence
on your right and a sling-shot-tree just behind the fence . At the end
of the fence, take the trail into the woods at 120 degrees. Travel on this
trail through the woods and rushes, coming to a sort of dike/berm. Climb
to the top and continue walking left. When the trail forms a 'Y' , take
the right trail.  In a short while a hugh oak tree seems to be growing
in the middle of the trail, as you get close to it, notice a lovely moss
'garden' on both sides of the trail. Stop and take a reading of about 80
degrees to where a cedar grows on your left. Go to that cedar and facing
back at the trail, look at 240 degrees at the base of the moss bank. Here
you will find LIGHT the WAY letterbox
<br/>Continue on the trail  to arrive back on that main trail close
to <i> Double Happiness</i>. If you turn right, the Quinnipiac River
is worth a short walk. To return to the Labyrinth and your car, walk west
on the paved trail.
<br/>Peace, and have a Butterfly day, enjoy the Labyrinth and the Linear
Trail.</p></body></html>

In the clues for the new Ct box, 'Light the Way' . to find the box<br/>
easily -- change the ending to read :<br/>
At the moss garden, stop and take a reading of 240 degrees to where a<br/>
lone cedar grows. Go to that cedar tree and face back at the trail. The<br/>
letterbox is low in the moss bank at 80 degrees.<br/>
So sorry to have flipped those two headings in my haste.!!<br/>
I just checked my box and see that folks have found it just the same.!!<br/>
Thanks to you all.<br/>
