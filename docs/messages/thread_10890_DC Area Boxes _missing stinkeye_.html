<br/>
It's very possible that The Stinkeye went MIA because<br/>
of all the snow.  It's also possible that it's just<br/>
buried (we hope).  It's a realy small film cannister<br/>
microbox.  Someone suggested that we put a stone on it<br/>
to keep it from washing away in the snow.  As soon as<br/>
the snow melts we'll check to see if it's lost or just<br/>
buried.  Either way it will be replaced/improved upon<br/>
as soon as the snow melts.  Sorry it didn't turn up,<br/>
but it sounds like you managed to find "a few" others<br/>
:) Thanks for the update.  <br/>

&gt; Hello all!  I've just come back from a great two<br/>
&gt; days in DC!  Thankfully <br/>
&gt; enough, there wasn't nearly as much snow as I<br/>
&gt; thought there would be, <br/>
&gt; however, it still hampered boxing!  One thing I've<br/>
&gt; learned about DC/MD/VA is, <br/>
&gt; THEY NEED TO LEARN HOW TO PLOW!!! :-)  On Friday,<br/>
&gt; they were still in a state <br/>
&gt; of emergency, and most of the school districts did<br/>
&gt; not have school all week!  <br/>
&gt; If CT hadn't had this week as school vacation, we<br/>
&gt; would have only missed <br/>
&gt; Tuesday (Mon. being a holiday)....!  The main<br/>
&gt; streets in the area were clear, <br/>
&gt; however, when I traveled the side streets of<br/>
&gt; Alexandria, they still had A LOT <br/>
&gt; of snow still on them!  Not only that, but the<br/>
&gt; parking area for Jones Point <br/>
&gt; hadn't even been plowed, and from what I hear, its<br/>
&gt; municipal parking!  I <br/>
&gt; actually got my car stuck in the lot and a very nice<br/>
&gt; lady in an SUV helped <br/>
&gt; push me out!  Thankfully, I have a front wheel drive<br/>
&gt; car!  When I got back <br/>
&gt; from planting the Jones Point Lighthouse box, a<br/>
&gt; Volvo got stuck in the same <br/>
&gt; parking lot, and I tried to push her out, but she<br/>
&gt; had rear wheel drive, and <br/>
&gt; was TOTALLY stuck!  I went down to the nearby<br/>
&gt; construction site and had a <br/>
&gt; couple of big good looking guys come and help her<br/>
&gt; out!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, as you know, I planted two boxes in the area<br/>
&gt; while I was there: <br/>
&gt; Concord Point Lighthouse and Jones Point Lighthouse.<br/>
&gt;  BTW.... I think Tom <br/>
&gt; (aka Scarab) from the Doubtful Guests, is going to<br/>
&gt; check on my Jones Point <br/>
&gt; one to make sure it doesn't float out to sea if the<br/>
&gt; Potomac starts rising, <br/>
&gt; however, if there is anyone in Alexandria who would<br/>
&gt; be willing to also check <br/>
&gt; for me, that would be great!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now to the boxes!  On Thursday night, I was<br/>
&gt; victorious in finding the <br/>
&gt; McKeldin Library stamp (great hiding place!), and I<br/>
&gt; attempted to find <br/>
&gt; Stinkeye, however Stinkeye has gone missing (NewBe1,<br/>
&gt; his wife, son Brennan, <br/>
&gt; and I checked back today to find Stinkeye and it<br/>
&gt; still wasn't there).  Friday <br/>
&gt; a.m, I was victorious in finding the Smithsonian,<br/>
&gt; Orion the Hunter, and Egypt <br/>
&gt; Explorer.  I met up with Tom (aka Scarab) in<br/>
&gt; Chinatown and he was very nice <br/>
&gt; to get the Year of the Ram LB down from its hiding<br/>
&gt; place, since I was not <br/>
&gt; tall enough to do it stealthily!  I also sent the<br/>
&gt; STS 107 Columbia HH on its <br/>
&gt; way.  After exchanging with Tom, he and I had lunch<br/>
&gt; and then went out to find <br/>
&gt; The Inventor and Skull and Bones.  We were<br/>
&gt; successful, after quite a bit of <br/>
&gt; digging in the snow!  I was so wet by that time,<br/>
&gt; that I called it a day and <br/>
&gt; headed back to the hotel to warm up!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On Sat. I met up with NewBe1 and his family at the<br/>
&gt; WaWa near Stinkeye to <br/>
&gt; exchange and LB, however, as I said before, not able<br/>
&gt; to find Stinkeye :-(<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All in all, a great weekend!  A very special THANK<br/>
&gt; YOU to NewBe1 and his <br/>
&gt; family, and Scarab for the exchanges and<br/>
&gt; conversation!  It was nice to meet <br/>
&gt; you!  (and Tom, hopefully, I'll get to meet the rest<br/>
&gt; of the family next time!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy Hunting everyone!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Music Woman<br/>
&gt; (back in snowy northern CT.... however, New Haven<br/>
&gt; didn't have much.... so it <br/>
&gt; looks like boxing can start again soon in southern<br/>
&gt; CT!!!!)<br/>
