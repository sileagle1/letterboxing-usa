We will definitely look for you the next time we are out on the trail.  Our <br/>
compass hanging around our neck is blue (with a whistle!) and our backpack <br/>
is green.  I think we would coordinate quite well!<br/>
<br/>
Curious who those other walkers were!  Maybe they will read the posts and <br/>
step forward.  Or, if they completely missed all the boxes...  We thought <br/>
the fungus ones were a little tricky and we actually went up and down a <br/>
couple of different stream banks ourselves!...<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can make the gather (remember what they say in My Big Fat Greek <br/>
Wedding, "the husband is the head of the family, but the wife is the neck -- <br/>
she can make the head turn anyway she wants it to go....)  BeMa :)<br/>

&gt;Subject: [LbNA] VA - my apologies to bema<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;My apologies (hope we didn't freak you out)...yours was the last entry in<br/>
&gt;the log book at "The Woods", so we just assumed it you guys (o.k. now the<br/>
&gt;lecture on never assume anything)...so whoever we were following that day<br/>
&gt;must not have stamped in.  OOOOOH, another mystery, who WAS it?  They <br/>
&gt;didn't<br/>
&gt;have a compass just the directions.  You can easily recognize us because we<br/>
&gt;have a compass with a green lanyard string around one of our necks, a <br/>
&gt;bright<br/>
&gt;blue backpack (with everything 5 people need including the kitchen sink) <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;directions in hand :-); we're working on our blending in with nature <br/>
&gt;skills.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The gathering sounds like fun, will need to check hubbys schedule too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Happy Homeschoolers<br/>
