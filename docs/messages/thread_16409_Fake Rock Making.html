<br/>
Ryan C. said that some folks are interested in my fake rocks. <br/>
Truthfully, I did not think that they were all that much appreciated <br/>
but will post something here and maybe then up at the PNWLB site.<br/>
<br/>
My material of choice is Amaco Sculptamold Modeling Compound. Three <br/>
pounds of it is about $5 + tax. Three pounds makes lots of rocks! It <br/>
sets up in about 30 minutes and is very nicely hard after a day. <br/>
<br/>
This is a website with it http://www.joann.com/catalog.jhtml?<br/>
CATID=2055&amp;PRODID=11161&amp;AID=10273743&amp;PID=874056&amp;afsrc=1<br/>
<br/>
I am now mixing craft paint in with the wet material as I mold it so <br/>
the color goes through the entire "rock". I like it to band a little <br/>
and am hoping to get better at making it do so. I put in some <br/>
glittery silver paint to get the effect of flecks of mica in it. <br/>
Choose colors from your area. Grey and black mottling can be very <br/>
persuasive as just a concrete lump. Check the clue for my Stone Soup <br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
I mold the material around a film cannister or food container <br/>
(T*pperware). I put the lid side down on the container so it can be <br/>
opened later. Sometimes I have to scrape away a little of the <br/>
material if it has overlapped the lid. No problem, the stuff can be <br/>
carved and sanded. <br/>
<br/>
After it is thoroughly dry, I spray the rock with at least two coats <br/>
of clear, matte-finish sealer. I suppose you could use glossy. I just <br/>
like the non-eyecatching quality of matte. <br/>
<br/>
More thoughts on this: Steve Rayvenhaus says he is experimenting with <br/>
Liquid Nails (a tough glue) and twigs. I got some of the Liquid Nails <br/>
and want to get some pea-gravel to glue to the food containers, too. <br/>
Thanks, Steve!<br/>
<br/>
I have also used oven-hardening clay. It is pretty much okay as it is <br/>
but I have sprayed it with a spackled rock paint (craft stores have <br/>
lots of these kinds) and again, folks look right past them. One is in <br/>
a very high traffic downtown location and has remained safe there, <br/>
much to my surprise. Again, waterproof these babies.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you can also hollow out rocks if you buy travertine and <br/>
use a concrete bit. Make sure you use respiratory and eye protection <br/>
while doing this. Gloves are also a good thought.<br/>
<br/>
I think you would be surprised at how brazen one can be with a fake <br/>
rock. Folks see what they think should be there, not what is truly <br/>
there. Heck, with fake rocks, hollow rocks, Liquid Nails and twigs, <br/>
we could make whole centerpieces in which to hide letterboxes. I have <br/>
thought of making a fake brick, too, but worry that someone might <br/>
decide they wanted it.<br/>
<br/>
Now a small caveat: my Amaco rocks are pretty lightweight. They have <br/>
also not yet gone through a California winter. You might have to use <br/>
more sealant for your area, maybe even put some real rocks glued <br/>
together with it to give it weight. I don't know. <br/>
<br/>
I am very interested in hearing from anyone else playing with this.<br/>
<br/>
Rock on,<br/>

Sir B, you are must too modest with your creative abilities.  =)  But <br/>
no need to post to the Pacific NW letterboxing board--everyone there <br/>
is on this board as well and it's certainly not a PNW related topic.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Really?  I'd like to check this out.  Which box was it?  Because I'd <br/>
like to put it higher up on my to-do list.  =)<br/>

<br/>
Hidden in plain view.  I love boxes like that.  =)  Part of the <br/>
reason I like the hiding place for my Walking Tour letterbox so much.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Now a small caveat: my Amaco rocks are pretty lightweight. They<br/>
&gt; have also not yet gone through a California winter.<br/>
<br/>
Please keep us informed on any new developments!  This is good <br/>
stuff!  (And let's face it, much cooler than tupperware under a bunch <br/>
of twigs or rocks.)<br/>

Don't know if Sir B. has already decided whether or not to give this location away, but <br/>
my suggestion to you, Ryan, is to start deciphering some of those Middle Earth clues <br/>
if you want to find this rock.<br/>

Dear Princess,<br/>
<br/>
I know the last thing in the world you wanted to do is to give Ryan <br/>
an additional clue to where that oven-hardening clay box is. He <br/>
probably had all the other non-encoded boxes anyway. So, telling him, <br/>
in essence, "Do your work, Turtle Boy!" you really did not give up <br/>
much on the location to a mystery box. Right? <br/>
<br/>
I am not going to give him any hints other than "Listen to a princess <br/>
and/or Nancy Drew when it comes to mysteries."<br/>
<br/>
BTW, just bought some new to me stuff, Flexall flexible all-purpose <br/>
filler. I plan on coating a T*pperware box with it and see how that <br/>
works. Might just sprinkle some local sand over it before it sets up. <br/>
Add a few choice pieces of rock and gravel affixed by Liquid Nails <br/>
and we should be cooking.<br/>
<br/>
Rockin' boxin',<br/>
