                    <div class="plaintext-content">There's a place a little south of DC, the Accotink Bay Wildlife Refuge, <br/>
adjacent to Fort Belvoir.  It's in a town called Lorton, VA.  There are <br/>
several series with great hikes in that refuge.  I would highly recommend <br/>
the following:<br/>
<br/>
Horror Movie Classics:  Be cafreful where you swim<br/>
Horror Classics:  The problem with Larry<br/>
These stamps are incredible and the clues freaked me out!  I was completely <br/>
alone in the refuge that day.<br/>
<br/>
There's also:<br/>
<br/>
The Little J Series<br/>
The McCarty Farm Series<br/>
<br/>
The McCarty Farm series may be a bit difficult right now if there's snow <br/>
down there.  I was relying a lot on the visual of the trail to get around.<br/>
<br/>
You can also easily pick up The Fern box.<br/>
<br/>
Fishman<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  I don't suppose anyone found a compass out along the McCarty Farm <br/>
trail some time after November?  I lost my good military compass and I think <br/>
it was out there.  Possibly near the Son of Sir Mosseness.<br/>

In DC anything by Scarab and the Letterboxers Our of Geogetown by Jem Hiest. Would not <br/>
recomend any thing at the rock creek nature center, won't go into details but don't waste <br/>
your time. These are recomendations if you can't get out of the city.<br/>

In the Tidal Basin there is a box hidden among the cherry trees<br/>
entitled "Cherry Blossoms".  The trees will not be in bloom and the<br/>
box is an easy hunt but the location is wonderful because of the art<br/>
work located there.  If you have never seen "The Awakening" then it is<br/>
worth the trip to the basin.  Be sure to take your camera to this<br/>
controversial statue that was almost removed a few years back.  It<br/>
seems that it is deemed a permanent piece now.<br/>
