When your significant other plants a box, do you stamp up at the<br/>
kitchen table BEFORE it goes out, or do you go out and find it along<br/>
with the masses?<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering because I have resisted the urge to stamp my book while<br/>
the box is still on the premises. Even though I helped him with<br/>
placement, clues and carving ideas. I think I just like the "hunt" so<br/>
much more then the PFX count.<br/>
<br/>
What about you?<br/>

My SO doesn't LB.  She's willing to help me interpret clues and play<br/>
navigator while I drive, but she stays in the car while I hike the<br/>
woods.  That being said...<br/>
<br/>
If I'm helping with placement and clues, then I'd call it a plant<br/>
rather than a find.  It's a find if you have to figure out where it's<br/>
hidden, not if you already know where it is.  And yes, I stamp my<br/>
plants into my logbook along with my finds, so go ahead and stamp on<br/>
your kitchen table, same as I do!<br/>

I have stamped into the logbook prior to a placement several times. We don't plant <br/>
together very often, so I would treat it as a find or just not stamp in and then find the <br/>
box anyway. If you were a stickler for the "rules" (!) then you'd only stamp into the log <br/>
prior to placing if you were actually helping him/her/SO plant the box, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I've also stamped in prior and let other folks stamp in prior to placing if they are <br/>
helping me plant the box/carved the stamp and or they were moral support. Nautilus <br/>
stamped into my LOVE mystery and another bonus box because she was physically <br/>
present and helped me locate the hiding spot(s). Sometimes people have others "beta <br/>
test" their boxes to make sure the clues aren't way off. In that case, the next first <br/>
finder when the clue is released might be really put off because they aren't techincally <br/>
first.<br/>
<br/>
I saw this subject come up as a discussion on this list a while back - related to the <br/>
whole first finders certificates. Personally, I don't do anything like that. But, if you <br/>
were to do that - I would discourage from letting your SO or beta testers stamp into <br/>
the box because it would make the finder feel as though they weren't actually first.<br/>

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br/>
<br/>
I've never had the exact same scenario because I'll plant without Keith (with <br/>
the oops! gang, with my sister, by myself, etc.) but Keith won't go out with <br/>
anyone other than me -- he sort of refuses to be part of anything with oops! <br/>
in the name.  So letterboxing to him is always a team concept -- he and I.<br/>
<br/>
We keep two different logbooks -- one for finds, one for plants. <br/>
<br/>
But I would say that if you're assisting him with placement, clues, and <br/>
carving ideas, then it's an "our" box, not a "his" box, and if it were me, I'd <br/>
stamp in at home, counting it as a place, not a find.  Even if you enjoy the <br/>
"hunt", you already rather know where it's going to be hidden if I'm reading your <br/>
email right.<br/>
<br/>
Now if he were to, say, surprise you by presenting you with clues to a brand <br/>
new box on, say, Valentine's Day, that he'd carved, figured the clues, placed, <br/>
etc. all by his lonesome just for you, then I'd say that definitely counts as <br/>
a find.  And one for which he should earn some sort of reward/brownie points <br/>
for.  That's my idea of romantic.  (Which, in my case, Keith would say "Keep <br/>
dreamin' little lady.")  :-)  <br/>

But to answer your question, one can't 'find' what they know is already there.<br/>
