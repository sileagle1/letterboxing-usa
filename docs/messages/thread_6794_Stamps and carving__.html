   I've been following the stamps and carving threads. At first I was <br/>
afraid of making my own stamp so I bought one. Today I went to <br/>
Michaels (courtesy of your suggestions) and lucked out getting the <br/>
pink speedy stamp 8 x 11 size for $2.00/sheet. Now I'm really getting <br/>
the hang of it. After seeing Fireflylights stamp I can see the reward <br/>
by collecting a homemade stamp.  Each one is so special and better <br/>

both East Bay (SF Bay Area) Calif do NOT carry any carving supplies. I had<br/>
to find them in a small art supply store in Berkeley a few years ago.<br/>
Michael's don't all carry the same stuff, and I would guess that some must<br/>

<br/>
In reference to your comment:<br/>
<br/>
 Two Michael's in  Massachusetts that I recently visited<br/>
 also did not carry ANY carving  materials.<br/>
<br/>
The Michael's in IL had no idea what I was talking about either - no matter how I described what I was looking for.  After scouring the aisles, I found the carving block myself.  Its possible that your store doesnt carry it - its also possible that they dont know their own inventory.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think it just depends on the individual stores.  I live on the west <br/>
side of Michigan and there are 2 Micheal's stores.  One has carving <br/>
supplies and the other has nada.  Both are relatively good sized <br/>
stores.  I have also found that even in the stores that carry it, <br/>
most of the employees "just work there" and have no idea about the <br/>
stuff or what it is used for.  I was disappointed though that the <br/>
store that did carry the pink stuff, didn't have it wrapped, and it <br/>
was filthy dirty (like it had lived it's previous life in the corner <br/>
of the warehouse).<br/>
<br/>
I have had better luck finding the pink stuff at Hobby Lobby (do you <br/>
have those?), but certainly not as cheap as $2 for an 8 x 11 sheet -- <br/>
WOW!  That was a great price!  I am paying about $5 for a 4 x 6 <br/>
piece.  I also picked up the Speedball carving tool set (plastic <br/>
handle and 5 ends) at Hobby Lobby, but prefer using an Exacto knife <br/>
for most carving.<br/>
<br/>
You may also want to try a rubber stamp store, if there is one around <br/>
your area.  I found the Mars erasers and carving pieces, and also <br/>
Speedball carving materials and tools locally at a store that carries <br/>
rubber stamps and dollhouse supplies.  Not exactly reasonable prices, <br/>
but something to get you going until you can locate economical <br/>
suppliers.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
Just wanted to say that I just sent an email to the Michael's Corporation suggesting that they might want to start stocking carving supplies.  I am fortunate to have a Michaels near me that carries some supplies, but they could certainly stand to carry more!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else would like to send them an email, just go to www.michaels.com and click on customer service.  From there you will want to go to "ask a question" where you can send them an email.  Perhaps if we bombard them with emails, they might get the idea!<br/>

may not understand what you're talking about, even if you use brand<br/>

the framing section.  I think they just put that merchandise way where<br/>

The Michaels on Va beach blvd near Pembroke mall DOES have <br/>

see a shelf that has pens and bottles of ink.  Go to the end of the <br/>

&gt; In reference to your comment:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Two Michael's in  Massachusetts that I recently visited<br/>
&gt;  also did not carry ANY carving  materials.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Michael's in IL had no idea what I was talking about either - no<br/>
&gt; matter how I described what I was looking for.  After scouring the<br/>
&gt; aisles, I found the carving block myself.  Its possible that your<br/>

&gt; I've carved a lot on plumber's gasket. It is somewhat difficult to carve<br/>
&gt; (more like linoleum). The biggest downfall is that you would have to mount<br/>
&gt; it on some sort of block because you can't hold the gasket.<br/>

I have never found these materials to be near the rubber stamping stuff<br/>

&gt; In a desparate search for some carving material I bought some cheap erasers<br/>
&gt; at K-Mart - a brand called School Select.  It's not as rubbery as the Mars<br/>
&gt; Staedler Carving block, a firmer block of rubber.  It carves very nicely,<br/>
&gt; and with school supply sales on, it should be had for a decent price.  It<br/>
&gt; comes in a package of 2 to a pack, and I paid about $1 for the package.  The<br/>
&gt; block measures not quite 1" x 2".  Haven't found a place to get the Mars<br/>
&gt; block nearby - no Michaels near us - just A.C. Moore.   -Kittlekatz<br/>

There is a Staedler website from which you can purchase and<br/>
find out who sells this.  If there is a college in your area,<br/>
try their bookstore, too.<br/>

that's right 79 cents.  They can be found in all the<br/>

&gt; They are kept with fine <br/>

&gt; for soft block and lino). $2 is a most excellent<br/>
