26 September 2003<br/>
<br/>
 From the Letterboxing Case Studies File: a subject herein known as "Eve <br/>
from Spokane" (in order to protect her identity). "Eve" is a female of <br/>
undisclosed age and of no apparent permanent residence (judging by her <br/>
mysterious appearances across the U.S. and despite her claims to the <br/>
contrary). A vociferous and vigorous letterboxer, Eve has made several <br/>
claims to have "special abilities" when it comes to accumulating hitchhikers.<br/>
<br/>
15 January 2003: Eve stated, "Are there too many hitchhikers out there...? <br/>
It seems like every box we find has a hitchhiker in it."<br/>
<br/>
18 February 2003 cf: "I have found 4 hitchhikers in the last 3 days!! I <br/>
think I must be a magnet for hitchhikers. I don't know what you guys are <br/>
doing out there, but if you want hitchhikers, then come letterboxing with me."<br/>
<br/>
Without scientific evidence, it is impossible to prove or disprove "Eve's" <br/>
assertions and suggest any course of remediation. Therefore, the following <br/>
experiment was devised.<br/>
<br/>
Experimental Protocol: Release a special hitchhiker into the wild and gauge <br/>
the time it takes to reach "Eve."<br/>
<br/>
Method: The "Hitchhiker Magnet" was created, a hitchhiker with a single <br/>
purpose -- to eventually reach "Eve" without any special intervention by <br/>
other letterboxers. This hitchhiker was released on 26 September 2003.<br/>
<br/>
Controls: All participants must agree not to interfere with the natural <br/>
travels of the Hitchhiker Magnet, by neither restricting nor facilitating <br/>
the hitchhiker's path towards reaching "Eve."<br/>
<br/>
Data Collection and Interpretation: The journey of the Hitchhiker Magnet <br/>
will be tracked at <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/box-hh_hitchhikermagnet.shtml. When the <br/>
Hitchhiker Magnet reaches the test subject, the hitchhiker will be retired <br/>
and the results will be examined to prove or disprove the hypothesis.<br/>
