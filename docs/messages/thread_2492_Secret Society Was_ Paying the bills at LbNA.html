&gt;If memory serves me correctly, alternatives have presented themselves in the<br/>
&gt;past.  In fact, searching the archives, I found several offers to host and<br/>
&gt;manage the website for free.  For one such example, see<br/>
&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/message/3363<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don't know in any of these offers still stand, but even if they don't,<br/>
&gt;there may be others on this list who may have the skillset or the resources<br/>
&gt;to handle this, and who would be willing to come forth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I think it would most in keeping with the spirit of this list, if this<br/>
&gt;discourse was held on the list, rather than behind the scenes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK I'm feeling a bit froggy today so I'll jump on this. The offer <br/>
mentioned above was made by me and subsequently withdrawn as I became <br/>
vaguely aware of the heated opinions of some behind the scenes when <br/>
discussing my offer. If anyone is interested in the history of why <br/>
this might be, I posted a brief overview to the list around the time <br/>
of my offer mentioned above.<br/>
<br/>
The Secret Society:<br/>
<br/>
Here is the issue. The webmasters are a secret group that has refused <br/>
to open the webmaster list archives to the group who's interest they <br/>
claim to represent. It has been others, not me, who requested it be <br/>
open. Up until today I have intentionally stayed out of it because I <br/>
was tired of all the BS. I have no idea what rational they use to <br/>
maintain this secrecy other than treating the letterboxing community <br/>
as children who couldn't handle their parents arguements and act in <br/>
their best interest. While it is true that many may not care about <br/>
the behind the scenes issues that make letterboxing work, those who <br/>
do care should know what is going on. I am confident many unpleasant <br/>
things have been said about me by some (NOT all) of that group, and <br/>
that is fine. However, I also believe that others in the group who <br/>
happen to have supported me in some manner (such as the hosting <br/>
offer) have taken considerable heat just for voicing their opinion. <br/>
In the interest of privacy I will not go into details, but just say I <br/>
have talked privately with more than one person who indicated the <br/>
level of acrimony that exists.<br/>
<br/>
That is my opinion. I will not debate it on the list with any <br/>
webmasters until they open the archives and pledge to remove this <br/>
veil of secrecy that allows them to hide their view from the <br/>
community. I suggest that any of you who care about such issues <br/>
pressure for the archives to be opened and further discussion to <br/>
become public.<br/>
<br/>
Well I have turned on the fan so let's see what hits it ;-)<br/>

If such a veil of secrecy exists it should be removed. In my opinion any<br/>
veil of secrecy like this is more objectionable than posting without your<br/>
real name.<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting to note the absence of some of the older and in my opinion<br/>
best letterboxers from this and other side issues like the<br/>
"safety/liability" issue.<br/>

With letterboxing, all I want is to get clues and find boxes. The <br/>

What can the webmasters do behind the scene that needs airing out?<br/>
<br/>
Poor color choices? Don't like the background design? HUH? What is it?<br/>
<br/>
These folks seem fairly powerless to me. If they put my clues up or link my<br/>
web page they have done everything.<br/>
<br/>
I DON'T GET IT!<br/>
<br/>
Are they modifying clues? Not putting them up? What are we suppose to find<br/>
in these secret archives?<br/>
<br/>
I really don't see what anyone has to lose or gain with these mystery<br/>
archives.<br/>
<br/>
I DON'T GET IT?  What is the problem?<br/>
