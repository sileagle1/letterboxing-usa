<p>Although most people think of the Goodwin Forest as being in Hampton, the 
letterbox and most of the route is just over the town line and is in Chaplin. 
Going from North Windham head east on route 6. Take a left onto Potter Road. 
This is the entrance to Goodwin State Forest in Hampton CT. There you will see a 
wooden sign stating this and a sign which states Pine Acres Lake. There is also 
a boat ramp sign. Follow this road a short distance to 11<sup>th</sup> section 
Rd which is a right hand turn. Travel down 11<sup>th</sup> section Rd 1.3 miles 
where the road turns sharply and there is a sign that says Esterbrook Rd. Bear 
left here onto unmarked road which is actually Nutmeg Lane. Travel 3 tenths of a 
mile. You will see several paths that cross the road here and a white marked 
trail on each side of the road. Park on the right side of the road. There is 
room for several cars here. Follow the white blazed trees which are on the right 
side of the road. Where you are parked. Following this trail you will come to a 
Y in the path. Bear left and leave the white blazed trail onto the unmarked 
trail. On this trail you will cross over four downed trees which are over the 
path. At the fourth downed tree, proceed 34 steps further down the trail. Look 
to the right, at 45 degrees and see the remains of four long rows of wood piles. 
The wood piles have long since rotted but the remains are still there. Go to the 
fourth row and look behind it on the far right corner of the woodpile. There you 
will see a small wooden draw upside down on the ground, covered with sticks. 
Under this draw you will find the Forgotten Woodpile letterbox. Just backtrack 
to get to your car. To get to the box will take you about fifteen minutes. The 
starting point where you parked your car is also the starting point of the Black 
Spruce Pond letterbox walk and both can be done easily in one 
day.</p></div></body></html>

<div>I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this posted this morning.  Dan, 
Max and I were hiking there yesterday with Sue, Tate, Sara, Stephani, John, and 
Maggie.  We found the 6 Green Boxes and the Bear Family!  We could 
have passed you and never known it!! Letterboxers should check out these boxes 
while they are there!  They looked a little lonely.</div>
