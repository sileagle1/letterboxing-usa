<br/>
There are about 28 LBs throughout beautiful Northwest Park in Windsor CT.  At the Country Fair this weekend. we will host a Letterboxing informational "booth".  The plan is to have copies of the clues for the NWP LBs, literature about Letterboxing, and a "non-event" stamp, and what would a "non-gathering" be without a special one day only Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are not attending the gathering on Cape Cod, this is a great alternative.  This will be the 24th edition of the Country fair and will be packed full of exhibits, activities,and refreshments.<br/>
<br/>
We hope to see some of our LBing friends.<br/>
