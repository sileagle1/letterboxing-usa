County, Ohio. Difficulty: Easy. Placed by Salamander on 4-13-03.   I <br/>
have never found any mushrooms at this park although a friend of mine <br/>
swears they're out there. If you follow the clues, you can be sure to <br/>
find at least one morel. CLUES: Near the Ireland Picnic Shelter, find <br/>
the disc golf marker which identifies "Hole 1, Par 3, 292'".Standing <br/>
in front of the marker, take a reading of 105 degrees and go 10 paces <br/>
at that heading to a fallen tree which is lying in an East/West <br/>
direction. The letterbox is hidden somewhere under this tree,covered <br/>
by some leaves. To find the correct spot, look for an area between 2 <br/>
small protruding branches which have been broken off to a few inches <br/>
each. NOTE: Be careful of some fallen wire fencing in this area, it <br/>
is difficult to see-- I didn't even notice it at first. <br/>
