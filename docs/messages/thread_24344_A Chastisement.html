Dear Investigator Bacon, <br/>
<br/>
     Should not the investigation of this matter be<br/>
explored in a more logical manner? You have<br/>
continuously informed me that your sources in the<br/>
letterboxing community have assured you of the<br/>
suspects questionable standards. However, this does<br/>
not seem to be the case! Have not all of these<br/>
suspects cleared their good names, having shown<br/>
themselves to follow the ethics of the game? I once<br/>
again implore the letterboxing community to aid in the<br/>
solving of this mysterious case. If you can be of<br/>
benefit, please send word to me.<br/>
<br/>
     Enchanting as the idea of a dog helping to find<br/>
the missing Store of Good Manners may be, dont you<br/>
find this a bit unrealistic? Are you grasping at the<br/>
proverbial straw here, Investigator Bacon? Must I<br/>
remind you that your fee, is, and always has been,<br/>
contingent upon your solving the case? Expenses that<br/>
you accrue along the way will be paid, as long as you<br/>
can prove they are of benefit to your solving of the<br/>
case. I do not believe that the purchase of a dog<br/>
muzzle fits this description. <br/>
<br/>
     Necessity has required that I inform you that<br/>
your expense account will be withheld until which time<br/>
as you can prove that the expenses are justifiable. I<br/>
would also like to express my displeasure of your<br/>
vocabulary. Was it really crucial to your case that<br/>
you describe in explicit detail what that dog could<br/>
do? <br/>
<br/>
    Dinner with a suspect would certainly be a covered<br/>
expense. However, I do question the consumption of<br/>
enough artichokes to feed North America. <br/>
<br/>
 Truly, <br/>
<br/>
Ms. Emily Post<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I cant say that I am at all surprised. I have been watching this investigation unfold all weekend as my human is away AGAIN without me. This time it was some lame excuse its too hot out for you sweetheart and youre soo old I worry about you. PU LEASE! She just worries about me witnessing her latest shenanigans and telling the man of the house. SO I was not at all shocked when the fingers started pointing her way. Save your doggie treats Inspector Bacon, Ill spill my guts for free. And dont worry Miss Post, no muzzle will be purchased for this hound. Nobody puts a muzzle on Dude! Just like nobody puts Baby in a corner!!<br/>
<br/>
  Where to beginit all started out so well. The woman adopted me when I was already a decade old and was very loving and kind. Couldn'tt do enough for me and with me.  Why, it was on a hike together many winters ago we stumbled across a muggled box and began our letterboxing adventures together. After that we dashed home and researched all we could about letterboxing. And I remember reading all of the information contained in The Store of Good Manners. We read it and lived itfor the most part. Discretion was never her strong suit. Much to my chagrin she would wear tie dye tee shirts in the woods to go letterboxing! A Tie Dye T-Shirt! Why, thats about as discreet as a scarlet dress at a funeral!! And she was often rather hung over and tended to curse quite a bit when she stumbled..or if the sun was too brightor she was having a hot flash. And shes loud, and burps a lotloudly. No, being discrete is a challenge for her. I, on the other hand, am the sole of discretion.<br/>
 I pretend to be sniffing the ground and piddle strategically so that people think she is just walking her dog who found a really interesting scent he simply cant leave alone. If the people linger too long I do something unmentionable in this public forum that usually makes them walk away disgusted. And that, Inspector Bacon, is the only time I have to worry about covering my tracks as it were. I am the most honest and  discrete letterboxer there is! She is about as discreet as a hog caller at a church service. Which makes me wonder how she could have gotten away with stealing the Store of Good Manners without getting caught? Mind you, Im not saying she wouldnt do it. I wouldnt have thought so years ago when we began this hobby but a couple of things have changed since then and here they are:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   She joined the Red Hat Boxers. And badder bunch of bawdy broads you have never seen! These women have no fearand no shame! This band of hormonal harpies are always together in small groups, or sometimes larger groups drinking, laughing, carving, setting fires, etc. Why, they even invaded Canada last year and crashed a bachelor party there!! I had to endure the humiliation of seeing my humans face plastered all over her talk list signing the silk panties of the hapless groom-to-be! Someone even re-posted some of those pics today, but thankfully my human is not in these.  <br/>
   She has been leaving me home more and more. She claims its because of my age, or people are going places where dogs cant go. If she were loyal to me she wouldnt go either! But I know the real reason, I know its so she can do unspeakable things and be sure I will not tell the man. Why she just got home about an hour ago supposedly from a gather in Virginia. Of course she was with a Red Hat, in fact she was with their Ringleader! These two gals together are a public menace!! I cant even image what went on there. All I know is she comes in the house with a bar of Irish Spring Soap, and instant towel and a fistful of cash and says to the man  I won the prize for being the dirtiest boxer at the Gather! Woo-hoo!! Im a little hung over, gonna take a nap. Oh, here, these are for you. You can model them for me later and with that throws a pair of mens boxer shorts his way with dragons all over them!! I looked at the man, and he just looked at me befuddled. What could I<br/>
 say? We can both only imagine the worst. <br/>
<br/>
  So yes, I would have never thought this possible even a few years ago. But now, I must admit I suspect her myself.<br/>

I spend all day Saturday out in the heat and humidity collecting stamps for OUR logbook, feeling guilty for leaving you behind and grateful that I did so cause I knew it would have been too much for you and this is the thanks I get!! Sure, I had a few drinks after and won a couple of prizes but not like YOU think! I just like to have fun, thats all!&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;br&gt;
  How could you suspect ME of stealing the Store of Good Manners?! Me?! When Im sober I am the most well-mannered letterboxer there is! Its only when I have my beer muscles that I mis-behave!  And even then, its mostly harmless stuff. Like crashing a bachelor party (Paul just loved us!), accidentally setting NJ on fire (not my fault! Why do they put a big honking grill thing in the middle of the fire ring if they dont want us to build a multi-level camp bonfire?), accidentally setting a picnic table on fire at French Creek (again, not my fault! I forgot to read the instructions on the little disposable grill that said Do not place directly on any flammable surface. Besides, Pink Panther put it out quickly enough). True, I do love my beer and occasionally suffer from the bottle flu but that doesnt mean Im not a good letterboxer. Except  when I was drunk and planted that box outside the puband then couldnt remember the clues the next daytwice. But I was not&lt;br&gt;
 alone that time, nor the second time, Miz Scarlet had a hand in both of those  fiascos! And I still cant find the darn box even when Im sober! And I planted it!! But listen, how many knuckleheads do we know who are also great letterboxers, hmm? The list of names boggles the mind. In fact I propose that it is their quirks and imperfections that make them such memorable figures.  &lt;br&gt;
   &lt;br&gt;
  Anyway who are YOU to accuse anyone of being indiscrete? If it wasnt for me running around behind you picking up your trail droppings youd pretty much be leaving a trail of steaming biological breadcrumbs all the way to the box! Discrete my eye! Have you never heard of the Leave No Trace concept!? And speaking of your ill-timed biological functions, what about that little incident with Gallant Rogues coolerhmmmm? Maybe theres a reason you dont get to go to any gathers that hes going to be at anymore, didja ever consider that, you flea-bitten mutt?!&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;br&gt;
  And how bout those 2 backpacks you got to frisky with at the Washington Crossing gather a few weeks ago? In front of about 18 little kids!!! Oh yeah, youre the soul of discretion alright!&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;br&gt;
  Come to think of it, Mr. Irene mentioned that not long ago he left the garden gate open while he was planting some tomatoes and you were gone for quite awhile. He says he called and called you but since you are deaf he knew you didnt hear him. You came back hours later panting and with muddy paws. Like you had been running and then digging. Digging what Dude, maybe hiding your ill-gotten gains? Did YOU steal the Store of Good Manners and bury it somewhere so I couldnt find it? Well, no more computer for you buddy! You are grounded for the foreseeable future. I am disconnecting the keyboard and putting it on top of the refrigerator. The only way you can get to it is if youre able to talk one of the cats into knocking it down to you. And you know how uncooperative they are!&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;br&gt;
  Im tired of this bickering and am calling for back up. Safari Man help! You know I didnt do it, dont you? Please come to my defense and restore my somewhat spotty reputation to the Letterboxing community.&lt;br&gt;

Well, I cant say that I am at all surprised. I have been watching this investigation unfold all weekend as my human is away AGAIN without me. This time it was some lame excuse its too hot out for you sweetheart and youre soo old I worry about you. PU LEASE! She just worries about me witnessing her latest shenanigans and telling the man of the house. SO I was not at all shocked when the fingers started pointing her way. Save your doggie treats Inspector Bacon, Ill spill my guts for free. And dont worry Miss Post, no muzzle will be purchased for this hound. Nobody puts a muzzle on Dude! Just like nobody puts Baby in a corner!!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Where to beginit all started out so well. The woman adopted me when I was already a decade old and was very loving and kind. Couldn'tt do enough for me and with me. Why, it was on a hike together many winters ago we stumbled across a muggled box and began our letterboxing adventures together. After that we dashed home and researched all we could about letterboxing. And I remember reading all of the information contained in The Store of Good Manners. We read it and lived itfor the most part. Discretion was never her strong suit. Much to my chagrin she would wear tie dye tee shirts in the woods to go letterboxing! A Tie Dye T-Shirt! Why, thats about as discreet as a scarlet dress at a funeral!! And she was often rather hung over and tended to curse quite a bit when she stumbled..or if the sun was too brightor she was having a hot flash. And shes loud, and burps a lotloudly. No, being discrete is a challenge for her. I, on the other hand, am the sole of discretion.&lt;br&gt;
I pretend to be sniffing the ground and piddle strategically so that people think she is just walking her dog who found a really interesting scent he simply cant leave alone. If the people linger too long I do something unmentionable in this public forum that usually makes them walk away disgusted. And that, Inspector Bacon, is the only time I have to worry about covering my tracks as it were. I am the most honest and discrete letterboxer there is! She is about as discreet as a hog caller at a church service. Which makes me wonder how she could have gotten away with stealing the Store of Good Manners without getting caught? Mind you, Im not saying she wouldnt do it. I wouldnt have thought so years ago when we began this hobby but a couple of things have changed since then and here they are:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
She joined the Red Hat Boxers. And badder bunch of bawdy broads you have never seen! These women have no fearand no shame! This band of hormonal harpies are always together in small groups, or sometimes larger groups drinking, laughing, carving, setting fires, etc. Why, they even invaded Canada last year and crashed a bachelor party there!! I had to endure the humiliation of seeing my humans face plastered all over her talk list signing the silk panties of the hapless groom-to-be! Someone even re-posted some of those pics today, but thankfully my human is not in these. &lt;br&gt;
She has been leaving me home more and more. She claims its because of my age, or people are going places where dogs cant go. If she were loyal to me she wouldnt go either! But I know the real reason, I know its so she can do unspeakable things and be sure I will not tell the man. Why she just got home about an hour ago supposedly from a gather in Virginia. Of course she was with a Red Hat, in fact she was with their Ringleader! These two gals together are a public menace!! I cant even image what went on there. All I know is she comes in the house with a bar of Irish Spring Soap, and instant towel and a fistful of cash and says to the man  I won the prize for being the dirtiest boxer at the Gather! Woo-hoo!! Im a little hung over, gonna take a nap. Oh, here, these are for you. You can model them for me later and with that throws a pair of mens boxer shorts his way with dragons all over them!! I looked at the man, and he just looked at me befuddled. What could I&lt;br&gt;
say? We can both only imagine the worst. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So yes, I would have never thought this possible even a few years ago. But now, I must admit I suspect her myself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A sadder but wiser (and completely innocent),&lt;br&gt;

Dear Investigator Bacon, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Should not the investigation of this matter be&lt;br&gt;
explored in a more logical manner? You have&lt;br&gt;
continuously informed me that your sources in the&lt;br&gt;
letterboxing community have assured you of the&lt;br&gt;
suspects questionable standards. However, this does&lt;br&gt;
not seem to be the case! Have not all of these&lt;br&gt;
suspects cleared their good names, having shown&lt;br&gt;
themselves to follow the ethics of the game? I once&lt;br&gt;
again implore the letterboxing community to aid in the&lt;br&gt;
solving of this mysterious case. If you can be of&lt;br&gt;
benefit, please send word to me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Enchanting as the idea of a dog helping to find&lt;br&gt;
the missing Store of Good Manners may be, dont you&lt;br&gt;
find this a bit unrealistic? Are you grasping at the&lt;br&gt;
proverbial straw here, Investigator Bacon? Must I&lt;br&gt;
remind you that your fee, is, and always has been,&lt;br&gt;
contingent upon your solving the case? Expenses that&lt;br&gt;
you accrue along the way will be paid, as long as you&lt;br&gt;
can prove they are of benefit to your solving of the&lt;br&gt;
case. I do not believe that the purchase of a dog&lt;br&gt;
muzzle fits this description. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Necessity has required that I inform you that&lt;br&gt;
your expense account will be withheld until which time&lt;br&gt;
as you can prove that the expenses are justifiable. I&lt;br&gt;
would also like to express my displeasure of your&lt;br&gt;
vocabulary. Was it really crucial to your case that&lt;br&gt;
you describe in explicit detail what that dog could&lt;br&gt;
do? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dinner with a suspect would certainly be a covered&lt;br&gt;
expense. However, I do question the consumption of&lt;br&gt;
enough artichokes to feed North America. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Truly, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ms. Emily Post&lt;br&gt;

&gt; Well, I can't say that I am at all surprised. I have been watching <br/>
this investigation unfold all weekend as my human is away AGAIN <br/>
without me. This time it was some lame excuse "it's too hot out for <br/>
you sweetheart and you're soo old I worry about you". PU LEASE! She <br/>
just worries about me witnessing her latest shenanigans and telling <br/>
the man of the house. SO I was not at all shocked when the fingers <br/>
started pointing her way. Save your doggie treats Inspector Bacon, <br/>
I'll spill my guts for free. And don't worry Miss Post, no muzzle <br/>
will be purchased for this hound. Nobody puts a muzzle on Dude! Just <br/>
like nobody puts Baby in a corner!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where to beginit all started out so well. The woman adopted me <br/>
when I was already a decade old and was very loving and kind. <br/>
Couldn't't do enough for me and with me. Why, it was on a hike <br/>
together many winters ago we stumbled across a muggled box and began <br/>
our letterboxing adventures together. After that we dashed home and <br/>
researched all we could about letterboxing. And I remember reading <br/>
all of the information contained in "The Store of Good Manners". We <br/>
read it and lived itfor the most part. Discretion was never her <br/>
strong suit. Much to my chagrin she would wear tie dye tee shirts in <br/>
the woods to go letterboxing! A Tie Dye T-Shirt! Why, that's about as <br/>
discreet as a scarlet dress at a funeral!! And she was often rather <br/>
hung over and tended to curse quite a bit when she stumbled..or if <br/>
the sun was too brightor she was having a hot flash. And she's loud, <br/>
and burps a lotloudly. No, being discrete is a challenge for her. I, <br/>
on the other hand, am the sole of discretion.<br/>
&gt; I pretend to be sniffing the ground and piddle strategically so <br/>
that people think she is just walking her dog who found a really <br/>
interesting scent he simply can't leave alone. If the people linger <br/>
too long I do something unmentionable in this public forum that <br/>
usually makes them walk away disgusted. And that, Inspector Bacon, is <br/>
the only time I have to worry about "covering my tracks" as it were. <br/>
I am the most honest and discrete letterboxer there is! She is about <br/>
as discreet as a hog caller at a church service. Which makes me <br/>
wonder how she could have gotten away with stealing the Store of Good <br/>
Manners without getting caught? Mind you, I'm not saying she wouldn't <br/>
do it. I wouldn't have thought so years ago when we began this hobby <br/>
but a couple of things have changed since then and here they are:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She joined the Red Hat Boxers. And badder bunch of bawdy broads you <br/>
have never seen! These women have no fearand no shame! This band of <br/>
hormonal harpies are always together in small groups, or sometimes <br/>
larger groups drinking, laughing, carving, setting fires, etc. Why, <br/>
they even invaded Canada last year and crashed a bachelor party <br/>
there!! I had to endure the humiliation of seeing my humans face <br/>
plastered all over her talk list signing the silk panties of the <br/>
hapless groom-to-be! Someone even re-posted some of those pics today, <br/>
but thankfully my human is not in these. <br/>
&gt; She has been leaving me home more and more. She claims it's because <br/>
of my age, or people are going places where dogs can't go. If she <br/>
were loyal to me she wouldn't go either! But I know the real reason, <br/>
I know it's so she can do unspeakable things and be sure I will not <br/>
tell the man. Why she just got home about an hour ago supposedly from <br/>
a gather in Virginia. Of course she was with a Red Hat, in fact she <br/>
was with their Ringleader! These two gals together are a public <br/>
menace!! I can't even image what went on there. All I know is she <br/>
comes in the house with a bar of Irish Spring Soap, and "instant <br/>
towel" and a fistful of cash and says to the man " I won the prize <br/>
for being the dirtiest boxer at the Gather! Woo-hoo!! I'm a little <br/>
hung over, gonna take a nap. Oh, here, these are for you. You can <br/>
model them for me later" and with that throws a pair of men's boxer <br/>
shorts his way with dragons all over them!! I looked at the man, and <br/>
he just looked at me befuddled. What could I<br/>
&gt; say? We can both only imagine the worst. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So yes, I would have never thought this possible even a few years <br/>
ago. But now, I must admit I suspect her myself.<br/>

&gt; Dear Investigator Bacon, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Should not the investigation of this matter be<br/>
&gt; explored in a more logical manner? You have<br/>
&gt; continuously informed me that your sources in the<br/>
&gt; letterboxing community have assured you of the<br/>
&gt; suspects' questionable standards. However, this does<br/>
&gt; not seem to be the case! Have not all of these<br/>
&gt; suspects cleared their good names, having shown<br/>
&gt; themselves to follow the ethics of the game? I once<br/>
&gt; again implore the letterboxing community to aid in the<br/>
&gt; solving of this mysterious case. If you can be of<br/>
&gt; benefit, please send word to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Enchanting as the idea of a dog helping to find<br/>
&gt; the missing Store of Good Manners may be, don't you<br/>
&gt; find this a bit unrealistic? Are you grasping at the<br/>
&gt; proverbial straw here, Investigator Bacon? Must I<br/>
&gt; remind you that your fee, is, and always has been,<br/>
&gt; contingent upon your solving the case? Expenses that<br/>
&gt; you accrue along the way will be paid, as long as you<br/>
&gt; can prove they are of benefit to your solving of the<br/>
&gt; case. I do not believe that the purchase of a dog<br/>
&gt; muzzle fits this description. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Necessity has required that I inform you that<br/>
&gt; your expense account will be withheld until which time<br/>
&gt; as you can prove that the expenses are justifiable. I<br/>
&gt; would also like to express my displeasure of your<br/>
&gt; vocabulary. Was it really crucial to your case that<br/>
&gt; you describe in explicit detail what that dog could<br/>
&gt; do? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dinner with a suspect would certainly be a covered<br/>
&gt; expense. However, I do question the consumption of<br/>
&gt; enough artichokes to feed North America. <br/>

This prompt confession strikes me as hollow.  Is it a diversion?  Or<br/>
is it more likely that Ryan is being blackmailed into confessing to<br/>
somebody else's thievery!?  Does the true thief have the goods on<br/>
Ryan, and merely getting him to confess to taking the Store of Good<br/>
Manners to throw off suspicion... I wonder who would be able to<br/>
blackmail Ryan into a confession.  Lady Prisspot seems to me to have<br/>
the most to lose it if were discovered she were the culprit.  Her<br/>
pristine image would be utterly shattered.  Please say it ain't so!<br/>

I am very experienced at hiding letterboxes *very* well. People have<br/>
even been known to be standing on them and still not be able to find<br/>
the boxes. It's up there. *nodding*<br/>

The "object" he claims to have stolen is, in fact, Miss Post's "Store of<br/>
Good Manners."  This is obviously impossible, since it is a well-known fact<br/>
that Ryan won't have anything to do with ANY "Store" that doesn't give a<br/>
kickback to AQ.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's called "logic".<br/>

&gt; If Ryan hid them, there's probably a 12-mile round trip hike just to <br/>
&gt; get them.<br/>
<br/>
There's actually the cog railroad you can take to the top. =) Be<br/>
warned, though, because some people allegedly get mooned by thru-hikers.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; i don't know exactly when this store went missing, but it was<br/>
&gt; definetly not on the top of mt. washington the last time i was there.<br/>

good finder.  <br/>
<br/>
now anything is possible, doubtful but possible. my track record of finding<br/>
letterboxes in floods, blizzards, demolations, and even ones the planter can<br/>
t find, speaks for itself. i can pretty much guarantee that the store is not<br/>
on top of mt. washington. i think i would know if i was standing on top of<br/>
something as big as a store. nope, ain't buying it!<br/>

And thus, the reason I needed to steal it and hide it. I'm holding it<br/>
for ransom. *nodding* Still trying to decide on a good price to let it<br/>
go for, though. How much is a Store of Good Manners worth to everyone?<br/>

Yes, it most certainly is. =)<br/>
