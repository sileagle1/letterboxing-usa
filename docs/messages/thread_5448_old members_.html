<br/>
Mitch moved from my neighborhood across town.  He is still involved, but on<br/>
a limited scale for sure.  Tom Cooch is pretty active on the webmaster list<br/>
&amp; behind the scenes.  Daniel (who just posted), is missed.  Erik &amp; Susan are<br/>
also still around, if somewhat behind the scenes.  Eric Mings is also on<br/>
this list.  He too was one of the original letterboxers in this country. How<br/>
about Bonnie Sennott?  Does she ever post?  I also miss reading Deborah's<br/>
posts about letterboxing with her daughters.<br/>
<br/>
It was a pretty tiny bunch back then.  Having 2 or 3 letterboxers in the<br/>
same state was a real luxury.  I marveled at the crowds at the latest east<br/>
coast gathering.  The first "letterboxing summit" occurred when Dan<br/>
Servatius flew out to visit his son at college here in Oregon.  Mitch &amp; I<br/>
met him at a pub and compared our meager collection of stamps.  Daniel was<br/>
using one of Susan Davis's carvings, a beautiful light house stamp.<br/>

    Thanks for the memories!  And Thom, thanks for<br/>
the note on the stamp, definitely still one of my<br/>
favorites.<br/>
<br/>
    We are here, Ben is (right now!) reciting the<br/>
Gettysburg address and Anna has just graduated<br/>
from MICA with a BFA.  We hope to do some<br/>
letterboxing this summer.  The last 3 years have<br/>
been consumed in helping Erik wage his war against<br/>
melanoma.  We continue to practice architecture<br/>
here on our wild Vermont hillside and scan the<br/>
talklist daily.<br/>
<br/>
    How is the first letterboxing baby?<br/>

Nice to hear from you. I'm glad you still are on the list, either if neither<br/>
one of us is posting too much any more.<br/>
<br/>
I'm still teaching sixthgrade in Vermont, busy with job and family. I work<br/>
at posting clues on the website, but don't get out hunting much - certainly<br/>
not during the winter. I do hope to catch up a little this summer with some<br/>
of the boxes in northern NE. Maybe revisit your 'white pearl' in Sheiling<br/>
Forest, which was one of my first.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
<br/>

I have not heard from those people in a long time.  I<br/>
have been very busy, myself, and am promising to get<br/>
myself out there to replace most of my letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
My mother saw on a local news report here in Green<br/>
Bay, that Letterboxing as become the coolest thing to<br/>
do in Oshkosh, WI (just south of Green Bay).  I told<br/>
my mother that I've been letterboxing for a while now.<br/>
 I think my mother is hooked.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if those wonderful people are still<br/>
around.  It would be wonderful to hear from them.<br/>
<br/>
With all my love and friendship,<br/>

Tom, thanks for the update too - glad to hear you're still around! 
And if you do go to Shieling Forest, you must look for my other box there! 
We need to check on it this season - I hope there have been more visitors,
but I understand it's been a bit tough.

<br/>
Yes, I'm still around!  And I post here now and again...using my Yahoo <br/>
username of monotropa, since I generally read the posts at the Yahoo <br/>
Groups Web site.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm still letterboxing, too.  I recently found the Mount Pollux box <br/>
in Amherst, Mass.--beautiful stamp and lovely views of the Pioneer <br/>
Valley there.  The last box I hid was a mystery box in western Mass.  <br/>
You can find the clue at LBNA or go to the Web page I maintain with <br/>
clues for boxes hidden by myself and my sister Betsey (most of hers are <br/>
nearer to Boston): http://users.crocker.com/~bsennott/letterbox.html<br/>
<br/>
It was Betsey who clued me in to letterboxing by handing me the <br/>
Smithsonian article several summers ago and saying, "This sounds like <br/>
something you might like."  Then, I did a search on letterboxing and <br/>
found the original email list, which later became LBNA.<br/>
<br/>
It has been great watching this hobby develop!  I feel lucky that I'm <br/>
close enough to Connecticut to go down and look for some of the <br/>
hundreds of boxes there.  What a state!<br/>
<br/>
Nisa, your Shieling Forest box was one of the first I found...along <br/>
with some of Tom Cooch's up in Vermont...so I will never forget all of <br/>
the "early" letterboxers....<br/>

  old members?<br/><br/></div><tt>Hello Nisa, Thom, Eric, Susan, Tom, 
  Randy, John, Mitch, et al....<br/><br/>Yes, I'm still around!  And I post 
  here now and again...using my Yahoo <br/>username of monotropa, since I 
  generally read the posts at the Yahoo <br/>Groups Web site.<br/><br/>And I'm 
  still letterboxing, too.  I recently found the Mount Pollux box <br/>in 
  Amherst, Mass.--beautiful stamp and lovely views of the Pioneer <br/>Valley 
  there.  The last box I hid was a mystery box in western Mass.  
  <br/>You can find the clue at LBNA or go to the Web page I maintain with 
  <br/>clues for boxes hidden by myself and my sister Betsey (most of hers are 
  <br/>nearer to Boston): <a href="http://users.crocker.com/~bsennott/letterbox.html">http://users.crocker.com/~bsennott/letterbox.html</a><br/><br/>It 
  was Betsey who clued me in to letterboxing by handing me the <br/>Smithsonian 
  article several summers ago and saying, "This sounds like <br/>something you 
  might like."  Then, I did a search on letterboxing and <br/>found the 
  original email list, which later became LBNA.<br/><br/>It has been great 
  watching this hobby develop!  I feel lucky that I'm <br/>close enough to 
  Connecticut to go down and look for some of the <br/>hundreds of boxes 
  there.  What a state!<br/><br/>Nisa, your Shieling Forest box was one of 
  the first I found...along <br/>with some of Tom Cooch's up in Vermont...so I 
  will never forget all of <br/>the "early" letterboxers....<br/><br/>Have a great 
  weekend,<br/>Bonnie Sennott<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></tt><br/><br/><tt>To
