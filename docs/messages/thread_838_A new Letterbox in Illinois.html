  Took the neighborhood kids to a park I used to visit as a kid and hid a <br/>
very kid friendly letterbox together. It was a great day to play in Illinois. <br/>

PS:  A few teachers at a local school district has picked up on letterboxing <br/>
and is using the hobby as an incentive and reward for good work for the <br/>
students.  I'm looking forward to seeing some new boxes planted by them.<br/>

Perhaps these teachers/students would like to incorporate their efforts<br/>
into the LbNA web page, as have the folks at the Valley Quest in VT/NH?<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, great that they got the exposure to letterboxing - I assume<br/>
from you. <br/>

Happy spring<br/>
