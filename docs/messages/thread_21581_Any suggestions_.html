Haven't done it, but if I did, I'd do it in this order:<br/>
1. Carve signature stamps<br/>
2. Box! You have to find them to get the hang of what it's all about.<br/>
3. Plan and brainstorm - Pick a place to plant a series. Think about <br/>
what kinds of clues you want, how hard it should be, etc.<br/>
4. Visit the proposed site and get a rough idea of box placement. <br/>
This may help refine ideas on clue types and stamp images. Start <br/>
rough draft of clues.<br/>
5. Carve the stamps, make the books, assemble the boxes.<br/>
6. Plant the boxes and make final revisions of clues.<br/>
How to fit 2, 4 and 6 into your time slot might be tough. :-)<br/>

<br/>
The only thing I would add to Aud's list below is that<br/>
I would not turn them loose on other peoples' boxes<br/>
right away.  I would plant some for them to find -<br/>
kind of a controlled experiment.  You want them to<br/>
learn how to be responsible boxers, but not at the<br/>
expense of unsuspecting planters.  Let them make<br/>
mistakes on your boxes (ones you plant for them to<br/>
learn on).  They'll make mistakes like poorly<br/>
rehiding, stamping in badly, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
A side benefit of letting them hunt your boxes is that<br/>
you are able to control the clues and you can gear the<br/>
clues toward your group and its strengths and<br/>
weaknesses.  As an example, when we were working on<br/>
map and compass, I planted some boxes with compass<br/>
readings only for them to practice on.  When we were<br/>
working on tree identification, I wrote clues based on<br/>
trees.  And so on...<br/>
<br/>
I like to hold out the possibility of hunting "real"<br/>
boxes as a reward for demonstrating responsibility. <br/>
