  Subject: [LbNA] mentioning other letterboxes in the area, in your clues<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Often when reviewing clues I see the mention of other letterboxes in the general vicinity.  For example, "Don't forget to bring the clues for ..." or "same starting point as...".<br/>
<br/>
  Do placers ask permission before including the names of other boxes?  And if not, do placers of the mentioned letterboxes seem to mind when they find out?<br/>

<br/>
Back in 2001, when I first started letterboxing, there were *zero* <br/>
letterboxes in my neck of the woods.  So I started planting like <br/>
mad.  Shortly thereafter, another boxer who was apparently thrilled <br/>
that there were now boxes in the area planted his own.  At the bottom <br/>
of his clues he wrote something to the effect of "and don't forget <br/>
Warrior Woman's nearby boxes" and he listed all my boxes.  He never <br/>
asked permission.  My thoughts?  Cool!  Free publicity!<br/>
<br/>
Recently, in 2004, I have seen new letterboxes planted in my area <br/>
which start with "Start at the same starting point as Warrior Woman's <br/>
XYZ boxes".  No one asked permission.  My thoughts?  Cool!  They <br/>
referenced my starting point without revealing its location, and the <br/>
finder will still have to do the research necessary to find the <br/>
starting point of my boxes!  How wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I take it as a compliment.  Thus far it has not been <br/>
abused.<br/>
<br/>
YMMV.<br/>
