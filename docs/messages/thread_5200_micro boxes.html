I am interested in experiences from both placers and finders of<br/>
boxes in very small containers (e.g. film canisters).<br/>

PS - as to the compass question, I view it as just one on a palette<br/>
of possible tools; I personally don't feel any one particular tool <br/>
or approach (or lack thereof) to clues adds or subtracts in and of <br/>
itself ... and enjoy looking at the whole clue, and in particular<br/>
how it works with the terrain.<br/>
<br/>
PPS - as an aside, my favorite clues are the sorts where the concept<br/>
or implementation behind them could not work in a location or path <br/>
other than the one they are in ...<br/>

I have been using the 35mm canisters in a few of my micoboxes, but I<br/>
think they really limit your contents.<br/>
You might warn fellow 'boxers to bring along a pen,and ink pad in your<br/>
clues.<br/>
It also limits the size of your stamp.<br/>
<br/>
An answer I had to this was cut out the bottoms of both canisters and<br/>
then tape them together.<br/>
You  end up with a bottom  to bottom  double sized container. !<br/>
<br/>
Better yet I have went to pharmacies and asked if they could spare a<br/>
pill vile (or two ).They come in various sizes, but I get the <br/>
5" long X 2" diameter ones . Almost all the pharmacist gave me a vile<br/>
with no problem. !<br/>
<br/>
I also think they have a pretty good water tight seal. ( Still in the<br/>
experimental stage on that issue. )<br/>
<br/>
If you are seeking a microbox be sure to have a small sig stamp !!!<br/>
<br/>
well , I hope this helps !<br/>

Hi randy,  we just hid several micro boxes on our trip to SD ...(I haven't <br/>
sent the clues in yet).  Previously we have hidden about 5 or 6 micros, At <br/>
first we put only a stamp in the canisters but then added a "scroll" so <br/>
people could stamp in.  It is easier to hide a micro in a well traveled area.<br/>
