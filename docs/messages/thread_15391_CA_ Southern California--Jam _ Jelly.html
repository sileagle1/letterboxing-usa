Waiting until the weather cools (late October) is a good idea before <br/>
going after my Eaton Canyon boxes--I think I'll post that in the clue <br/>
description.  I've already posted a hot-weather warning against going <br/>
after my more arduous Henninger Flats LB.  Thanks for visiting my <br/>
friendlier Pasadena Humane Society box--did you find it a difficult <br/>
box to grab with all the people about?  It's easy to grab on a Sunday <br/>
when the Dog Pound (oops, I mean the animal shelter) is closed, but <br/>
then you don't get to visit the dogs!  My wife, new letterboxer <br/>
French Hen, and I will be making a trip to your restored Strange <br/>
Stamp Series #2 this weekend.  Happy belated birthday to Jelly.<br/>

&gt; stamp! Buzzard, always good to see your stamp. We promise to get up <br/>
&gt; to Pasadena and visit your new box. Will try Eaton Canyon when it <br/>

&gt; little.<br/>
