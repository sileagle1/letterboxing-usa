                    <html><body>The Bananaconda, placed 11/15/02 by the Cricket Bros in Deerlick Park, Fairfax County, VA, near Annandale and Springfield.  Inspired by a poem from "Scranimals", by Jack Prelutsky and hopefully soon to be joined by its poetic kin.<br/>
This is a small suburban park, an easy walk suitable for small children and strollers ok except the last little bit. The park is at its best in the late spring and summer, when thick growth drowns out civilization and its noise.<br/>
Take 495 to the Braddock Road east exit.  Deerlick Park is on Braddock Road, between Backlick Road and Montgomery Road.  <br/>
Park in the lot and follow the path to the left of the tennis courts.  Past a bench to the first left branching of the path and take the left path.  At the bridge, stop and turn to 340 degrees of north, along the stream.  20 paces (or 40 grown-up steps) into the brush there will be a long, fallen sapling-tree on your right.  5 steps up the length of the sapling, beneath the tree on the left side you will find the lair of the Bananaconda.</body></html>
