                    <div class="plaintext-content">This beautiful morning my mom and I headed out to Santa Barbara for a <br/>
day in the sun doing exciting stuff such as shopping and letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
First up: Seven Falls Letterbox.  It's alive and well, although as I <br/>
was stamping in a woman with a baby sat down at the creek and decided <br/>
to stick around forever and a day.  Finally I rehid the letterbox <br/>
even though she was there and was probably watching me the whole <br/>
time.  If it's missing, it was probably her!<br/>
<br/>
Next up: Critters of Ennisbrook.  What an INCREDIBLE series of <br/>
absolutely GORGEOUS stamps!!!  Did you make the rock yourself?!  <br/>
That's a neat trick, whereever that rock came from for the one <br/>
particular box.  And the one in the end of the log--what a CUTE box!  <br/>
I can't believe more people haven't nabbed this series.  Absolutely <br/>
stunning.  In fact, I was the ONLY person who's nabbed the last box <br/>
in the series.  What happened to the rest of you?!<br/>
<br/>
The Stonehen box was a tempting box to go after, but neither my mom <br/>
nor I knew where to begin so we figured we'd save that one for <br/>
another day.  *shrug*<br/>
<br/>
And last (but certainly not least!) I nabbed the Nojoque Falls and <br/>
the Turtle where I also picked up Mokie, the Wandering Huskey HH that <br/>
came to visit all the way from Pennsylvania!  It seems it's been <br/>
there for a good month or two, though, and it's itching for a good <br/>
road trip to stretch its legs a little.  Who knows where it might end <br/>
up?<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of hitchhikers, I discovered Honor Liberty hiding out at <br/>
Montana de Oro about a week ago, and released it at the Seven Falls <br/>
letterbox in Santa Barbara.  Typically I don't say where I rehide a <br/>
hitchhiker, but the directions in it clearly state that this is <br/>
a "different" type of hitchhiker, and one should post it's current <br/>
location whenever it's rehidden.  Well, it's sitting there at Seven <br/>
Falls waiting for someone to move it on its way....<br/>
<br/>
By the time my mom and I were heading back north, nasty looking storm <br/>
clouds were coming in.  Fortunately, it didn't bother us much in the <br/>
comfort of a well-heated vehicle hurtling down the highway.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ryan, great to see you've left some ink in Santa Barbara!  It was an <br/>
unintended visit to your Los Osos Oaks series (you may recall the <br/>
Pants Incident) that got me started in 'boxing.<br/>
As for Stonehen, there are 3 tools you (or anyone) will likely need <br/>
for that hunt.  A Santa Barbara County road map, a printout of the <br/>
Stonehen cluepic, &amp; a pair of long pants.  A nice box to visit around <br/>
sunset, by the way.  As far as I know, it remains unconquered.<br/>
