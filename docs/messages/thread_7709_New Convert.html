                    <div class="plaintext-content">    The hubby (DH) decided to give it a go again this past Friday. <br/>
This would be his second outing. I planned on nabbing 3 boxes <br/>
starting with Squirrels' Mystery Box. Off we went. We hunted close to <br/>
2 hours for that box. DH was bound and determined to find it. I told <br/>
him my theory of where it was(naturally it was different from his) <br/>
and we should leave to find the next two. While driving to the next <br/>
location he kept going over Squirrels clues convincing only himself <br/>
that he had been close. I still believe in my theory!<br/>
    Nabbed the second box and off to #3. This is where we stumble <br/>
across our first Benchmark. For those out there it is a survey <br/>
marker. AND yes, I know this subject belongs in the Geocaching site, <br/>
but it is pertinent to my story! DH is so excited to give me a lesson <br/>
on benchmarks. I write down all the info. on the disk so I can log it <br/>
in.  Later I find out I should have taken a picture. I don't have a <br/>
GPS to get the co-ordinates, but I can bet that Mr. Technology will <br/>
get a GPS soon!<br/>
     After finding box #3 we drove home. DH was all a twitter. <br/>
Talking about what his handle would be and how he wanted to carve his <br/>
own stamp! When I told him some people use a dremmel, well that just <br/>
fueled his fire. POWER TOOLS!!!!!!<br/>
    Back home. I go to try to log in the benchmark and can hear the <br/>
drill in the distance! Proudly he shows me his stamp. "Pretty darn <br/>
good for the first time" I tell him. "It's all in the tools" is his <br/>
reply.<br/>
    So I present to the community, Silver Fox, a new convert. I doubt <br/>
he will go with me all the time. Given a choice between swinging his <br/>
clubs and hunting for boxes, I'm sure he'd choose being with <br/>
his "peeps" on the links!<br/>
    The End<br/>
<br/>
  p.s. I recommend using the dremmel outside. My kitchen has little <br/>
rubber bits everywhere! Now, if only he could get excited on the <br/>
clean up.<br/>
