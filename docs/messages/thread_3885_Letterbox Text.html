It's a Der Mad Stamper creation, and I've planted maybe 1000 of them: <br/>
they're that good.<br/>

<div>Here it is pasted into the this note:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p align="center">What is this thing that you’ve found???</p>
<p align="center">It’s a letterbox</p>
<p>Letterboxing is an intriguing mix of treasure hunting, art, navigation, and 
exploring interesting, scenic, and sometimes remote places. It takes the ancient 
custom of placing a</p>
<p>rock on a cairn upon reaching the summit of a mountain to an artform.</p>
<p>Here's the basic idea: Someone hides a waterproof box somewhere (in a 
beautiful, interesting, or remote location) containing at least a logbook and a 
carved rubber stamp, and perhaps other goodies. The hider then usually writes 
directions to the box (called"clues" or "the map"), which can be 
straightforward, cryptic, or any degree in between. Often the clues involve map 
coordinates or compass bearings from landmarks, but they don't have to. 
Selecting a location and writing the clues is one aspect of the art. </p>
<p>Once the clues are written, hunters in possession of the clues attempt to 
find the box. In addition to the clue and any maps or tools needed to solve it, 
the hunter should carry atleast a pencil, their own personal rubber stamp, an 
inkpad, and a personal logbook. When the hunter successfully deciphers the clue 
and finds the box, they stamp the logbook in the box with their personal stamp, 
and stamp their personal logbook with the box's stamp. The box'slogbook keeps a 
record of all its visitors, and the hunters keep a record of all the boxes they 
have found, in their personal logbooks. </p>
<p>Please replace the box and its contents exactly where you found it, hiding it 
well, so that others who are playing the game can solve the clues and find it 
too. </p>
<p>Has this piqued your interest? You can join in the fun. The clues for 
hundreds of other boxes can be found by going to the website: </p><a href="http://WWW.LETTERBOXING.ORG/"><u>WWW.LETTERBOXING.ORG</u></a> on the internet. Everybody is welcome to hunt for and 
place boxes. You can take this info sheet with you.</div>
