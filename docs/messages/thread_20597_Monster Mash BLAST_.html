Hi boxers;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who created such a wonderful event - the best gather Sue<br/>
&amp; I have ever attended! <br/>
<br/>
We met lots of new people and it's great to see and hear of their<br/>
enthusiasm for this game. This pastime seems to be in good hands among<br/>
all of the great newbies getting involved. Also, great fun to see<br/>
friends of old. Thanks to all who met me with "Spannerman." For those<br/>
of you that might have missed it, this Dartmoor stamp will be<br/>
available at future gatherings. Thanks also to all who inquired about<br/>
the events of the Baker's Dozen and the episodes recorded on our<br/>
website.<br/>
<br/>
The event also held some surprises - we were glad to see our friend<br/>
Alafair with Patrick at the event as well as meeting, purely by<br/>
chance, another letterboxing great - Rae Record. Rae was in<br/>
letterboxing in the beginning, at that gather in VT back in the late<br/>
1990's with the Davises, Tom Cooch, Randy Hall, and others. In fact,<br/>
Rae told me that she took that picture that many of you have seen on<br/>
the old archived letterboxing.org website.<br/>
<br/>
Ever vigilant, I asked Rae if she would do an interview with me for<br/>
our Series and she quickly agreed. Seems she's read all of our<br/>
interviews and even clarified a few points in several of them. Look<br/>
for her interview sometime this winter. Rae is an author and just by<br/>
our few minutes together I can see the makings of a great interview.<br/>
<br/>
Most of all, thanks to Chuck, Chickabirdee, Teach &amp; Preach, The<br/>
Maplines, and all of the volunteers who made this event one for the<br/>
record books! I heard that the final count was about 343! That's<br/>
amazing - and the fun with the Monsters continues all this month -<br/>
talk about a gathering that keeps on giving.<br/>
<br/>
One sugguestion I have is that all who have sent boxes to Chuck for<br/>
this event without return postage, myself included, remember to mail<br/>
him a check to cover that. With 120 boxes times about $4 per box for<br/>
return postage translates in too much money for Chuck to put out out<br/>
of pocket. Let's show our support for this wonderful project by<br/>
minimizing his output.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
