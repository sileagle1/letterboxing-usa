                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today John and I went on a quest to nab three of Der Mad Stamper's<br/>
letterboxes.  We were hoping to get at least one stamp, but actually<br/>
managed to get all three we were seeking!!!  What an absolute thrill.<br/>
<br/>
First we drove out to Tryon Creek State Park in Lake Oswego,  where I've<br/>
never been before.  We had the old clues for the first letterbox that<br/>
originally did not have cryptogram clues and we found it!  It was<br/>
delightful.  A beautifully-carved stamp by Der Mad Stamper.  What a way<br/>
to start our adventure and what a great park.  We may have to figure out<br/>
the clues for the other letterboxes hidden there.<br/>
<br/>
Our second attempt was at Council Crest in Portland.  We didn't think<br/>
there would be many people there since it was cloudy, but we were wrong.<br/>
The clues were terrific and we actually found the box!  BUT...It was<br/>
full of water (in spite of three ziplock freezer bags) and covered with<br/>
mud.  We were so excited and surprised to be the first ones to stamp in<br/>
since it's been there since February.  We washed the bags at the<br/>
drinking fountain, dried everything off as best we could (log book was<br/>
damp, but not destroyed), and replaced two of the faulty ziplocks.  They<br/>
were doing like zippers when they get broken.  We returned the box.  I<br/>
put it more right side up than I found it and put it toward the less<br/>
muddy side of its hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
Next stop and what we were sure would be the most challenging was Elk<br/>
Rock Island -- Der Mad Stamper's most recently placed box.  What a cool<br/>
place!  Where do you come up with these wonderful spots, Mitch?  This<br/>
was a job for a person with a brain, so John was the main seeker of this<br/>
one.  He did great with his trusty (and more reliable) compass.  We<br/>
found the box.  We thought we would be the first to get this one, but<br/>
NAY, NAY!  The Zilk family beat us to it, and yes, they do need their<br/>
own stamps, that's for sure.  They are finding quite a few boxes lately!<br/>
We saw they had stamped in at another box we stopped at.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a great day of letterboxing, Mitch.  That Elk Rock Island is<br/>
really awesome and your clues and hiding place are terrific.  Not much<br/>
chance of anyone haphazardly stumbling onto that puppy!  The ivy might<br/>
trip you up and break your neck, though.  Excellent hand-carved stamp<br/>
(like we've come to look forward to from you) and the container was<br/>
whimsical and will probably endure quite nicely.<br/>
What a excellent weekend.  Our F count is up three now!  I'll have to<br/>
see what our counts are and maybe order some merit patches.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
