Oct 20th 2002<br/>
City: Portland OR<br/>
County Multnomah<br/>
Stamp (very good if I do say so myself ha ha) lol kidding<br/>
Clues Easy I feel only not quite flowing together so that it is a little more challenging.<br/>
Area High traffic so watch who is watching you.<br/>
<br/>
To find the letterbox:<br/>
Find SE Morrison &amp; the Willamette<br/>
The KOIN Tower is at 225 degrees and the Big Pink is at 300 degrees Beneath the ribbed steel<br/>
Have a seat to take the read and feel free to take a reach to your right...no one will be the wiser.<br/>
Above you over your left shoulder you will see the number five.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone thinks this is a location that has too much traffic let me know and I will relocate it. <br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
The Goose.<br/>

I had actually walked around here the day you hid it--to think, we <br/>

as soon as I saw your clue, I immediately laced up my shoes <br/>
and ran out to nab it.  (Literally--it was maybe a half-hour walk <br/>
away.)  <br/>
<br/>
Then I walked over to Borders where I leafed through the travel <br/>
section reading all about Mexico and Guadalajara and books <br/>
about learning French.  (Yes, I know they don't speak French in <br/>
Mexico.  *rolling eyes*)<br/>
<br/>
And finally walked over to Taco Bell--which is my version of going <br/>
south of the border--where I worked on Spanish crossword <br/>
puzzles or an hour or so before walking back "home".  (It's not <br/>
really my home, but it's where I'm staying at the moment.)<br/>
<br/>
Which none of that after the letterbox has anything to do with the <br/>
letterbox, except to say that I had a wonderful afternoon and <br/>
thanks for the walk!  =)<br/>

I don't know where any Astro gas stations are, but I'm currently <br/>
hanging around maybe ten blocks from Lloyd Center.  *evil, <br/>
