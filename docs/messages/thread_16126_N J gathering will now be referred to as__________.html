"THE HUNT FOR THE JERSEY DEVIL LETTERBOX GATHERING<br/>
<br/>
First annual TRI state NJ DE PA letterboxing gathering (all others <br/>
welcome)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DATE: 		October 26, 2003 (Sunday) (Rain or Shine - covered <br/>
pavilion)<br/>
TIME: 		Approximately 11 am  3 pm<br/>
WHERE: 	PAKIM POND<br/>
		Brendan T. Byrne State Forest 			<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/byrne.html <br/>
(formerly Lebanon State<br/>
		Forest) Shinn's Road (off Route 72), New Lisbon, NJ <br/>
08064<br/>
<br/>
*RSVP*: 	Please, no later than Wednesday, October 22, 2003<br/>
<br/>
Terrain: 	From parking lot to pavilion is packed dirt.  <br/>
Pavilion floor is cement. Trails are packed<br/>
		dirt, little bit rooty. **Some trails specifically <br/>
marked wheel chair accessible.**<br/>
<br/>
Your Cost: 	A Pot Luck dish please, hot or cold<br/>
<br/>
Bathrooms: 	yes Handicap friendly<br/>
<br/>
Events: 		Exchanges, exchanges and more exchanges.  Any <br/>
suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Event Boxes: 	There will be several event boxes hidden just for <br/>
this gathering. There are several other<br/>
		permanent boxes within approximately 10 miles of this <br/>
event. <br/>
<br/>
Exhibits: 	Does anyone want to volunteer their services to teach <br/>
stamp carving, log book making or<br/>
		an advanced rubber stamp technique?<br/>
<br/>
Requirements: 	Please bring your own BBQ utensils, charcoal and ice, <br/>
if needed. They do have soda<br/>
		machines there. There are 6 picnic tables and 6 <br/>
charcoal grills (unless severe dry (drought)<br/>
		conditions are in effect). Alcoholic beverages are <br/>
prohibited in this park. Furred animals or<br/>
		pets are prohibited from buildings, bathing areas, <br/>
all camping areas and over night<br/>
		facilities. Unduly annoying conduct is prohibited. <br/>
All firearms of any kind are strictly<br/>
		prohibited. Not my rules  the state park rules.<br/>
<br/>
Goal: 		To bring as many southern New Jersey letterboxes <br/>
together to form some sort of group,<br/>
		club or social to make more people aware of this cool <br/>
hobby. To plan monthly weekend<br/>
		hunts with other south Jersey letterboxers. The <br/>
pavilion is costing me to rent it for the day.<br/>
		If enough people come to the gathering and are <br/>
serious in starting a group we can organize<br/>
		a way or take donations to have more gatherings in <br/>
the future. Because anywhere we hold<br/>
		the next gathering we will have to pay for the site <br/>
if we want similar facilities. So please<br/>
		try and come out to this gathering and lets try to <br/>
make this group work. (Any and all<br/>
		suggestions welcomed) See you there. <br/>
<br/>
Coordinator: 	letterboxing (Bev)<br/>
		I will bring paper plates, cups and napkins.<br/>
<br/>
