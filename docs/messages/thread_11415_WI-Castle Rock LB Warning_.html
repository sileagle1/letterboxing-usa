(Camp Douglas) letterbox.  First, the box IS there and my friend and I and<br/>
his kids were the first to find it!  However, due to its proximity to a<br/>
military base, the MPs we encountered (although pleasant) made it clear that<br/>
there better not be any more letterboxers searching for the box until the<br/>
area it is in is opened for the summer on June 2nd, and then only during the<br/>
daytime.  During this time of crisis, I'd suggest obeying this request.<br/>
Otherwise you might find yourself surrounded by some of America's finest<br/>
without warning like we were!<br/>
<br/>
Note: Matt the Rat's other "mound" boxes were all in their places on<br/>
Saturday and in good condition too!<br/>
