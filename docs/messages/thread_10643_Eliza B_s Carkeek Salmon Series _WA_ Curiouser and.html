                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went out on this beautiful spring-like day to do the Carkeek Salmon <br/>
series again, and I'm just confused!<br/>
<br/>
There are still only three stamps total, but one of the two that used to <br/>
be in the third box has been moved to the second.<br/>
<br/>
So:<br/>
<br/>
Box 1 - both times has a stamp of a salmon carved in a Haida Indian <br/>
style, and the word "ida"<br/>
<br/>
Box 2 - last time, no stamp. This time, a stamp of two salmon that says <br/>
"use dark ink- stamp 2" on the back, that used to be in the third box.<br/>
<br/>
Box 3 - last time, 2 stamps, one that has two salmon that said "salmon" <br/>
(now in the second box), and another that said "run" so when you stamped <br/>
it over the other you have a two-tone stamp that says "salmon run". This <br/>
time, just the "run" stamp only.<br/>
<br/>
So, are there supposed to be 4 stamps now? or were there always supposed <br/>
to be just three?<br/>

series of stamps/letterboxes:<br/>
<br/>
Each of these images should pertain to one separate/unique letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
--an image of Morgan Carkeek with a train and a nickel in the <br/>
background and the words 'Carkeek Park' inscribed in the bottom left<br/>
<br/>
--an image of a salmon with 'ida' beneath it<br/>
<br/>
--an image of a King Salmon complete with crown on his head and the <br/>
words King Salmon above and below the fish<br/>
<br/>
--a double sided or 2 color image of 2 salmon swimming upstream--one <br/>
imprint is of the water with the word 'run' to the bottom right and <br/>
the other imprint is of the 2 salmon with the word 'salmon' in the <br/>
center, right (this was probably 2 separate stamps but I can't <br/>
remember exactly because I did the series back in Sept 02)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are also three other boxes in Carkeek--they are Candlelight's.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps clarify the confusion a bit.  Looks like the stamps <br/>
may have been jumbled up a bit between the different letterboxes in <br/>
the series...<br/>

King Salmon is a jaunty fellow with a crown.<br/>
<br/>
Salmon Run, I cannot remember if it is two stamps or a double sided <br/>
one,either.  You did have to stamp in twice to get the overlay result.<br/>
<br/>
Eliza, I think after all, you do have to re-carve Kinfg salmon.<br/>
