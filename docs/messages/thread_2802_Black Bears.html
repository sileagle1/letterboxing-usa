                    <div class="plaintext-content">For the first time EVER, two black bears actually killed and ate a human <br/>
last year (or maybe the year before) here in the Smokies.  She was an <br/>
experienced hiker, and presumably then knew not to approach or feed the <br/>
bears.  Foul play was ruled out (her estranged husband was nearby fishing), <br/>
and the bears had to be destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
This is not typical bear behavior, but you just can't be careful enough out <br/>
in the woods.<br/>
