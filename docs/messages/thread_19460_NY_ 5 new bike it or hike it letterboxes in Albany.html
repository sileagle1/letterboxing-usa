                    <div class="plaintext-content">Noticed those new 'bike or hike' LBs, fellows; and as a cyclist, as <br/>
well as letterboxer, I promptly printed off the clues for later <br/>
action.  But I must protest the tiny font and red color that you used <br/>
for the clues - not kind to senior eyes, for one thing.  I printed <br/>
one set off in slow &amp; ink-wasting "regular" mode, and that does make <br/>
it more readable, at least.  Please think twice next time.  But <br/>
thanks for your efforts in placing the several boxes.  Things have <br/>
been pretty quiet in New York until very lately.<br/>
