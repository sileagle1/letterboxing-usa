Cancer corner.  Seems I was to confident I knew where it was and <br/>
didn't really read the clues.  I'm going to try again this weekend.  <br/>
As for the Artesian Well I won't hunt it again till I get notice it <br/>
is still there.  I'm not comfortable snooping around where it is <br/>
hidden. <br/>
