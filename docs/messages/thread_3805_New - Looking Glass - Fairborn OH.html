Near: Fairborn, Greene County Ohio<br/>
Difficulty: 2 (a short walk on narrow paths)<br/>

'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice.  <br/>
<br/>
This little adventure takes you on almost trails trails that were.  <br/>
These trails remind one of falling through the rabbit hole on the <br/>
other side of the looking glass.  The path often presses downward <br/>
with a close roof of tendrils over your head.  Occasionally you will <br/>
need to bend slightly to continue on the trail.  In addition, you <br/>
will also tread on the granddaddy trail of Ohio  The Buckeye Trail <br/>
itself.  But we are getting ahead of ourselves, are we not?<br/>
<br/>
To begin, find the intersection of Black Lane and Armstrong in the <br/>
eastern part of Fairborn  east of  Interstate 675.   If you tucked a <br/>
GPS in your bag, it will be considerably easier if you head for<br/>
N 39 50.125  W 83  59.085.  These are the coordinates of a turn off <br/>
from Armstrong on the Northern side of this small 36 acre park.  No <br/>
real parking, it is a grassy shoulder occasionally used.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't know what Fairborn plans for this little park.  Whatever it <br/>
is, they have not done it yet. Or they stopped doing it.  It is hard <br/>
to tell the difference.  More than anything else it reminds me of the <br/>
brushy "woods" near my house when I grew up.  It was a pasture about <br/>
20 years ago and has not had time to recover a hardwood forest.  <br/>
<br/>
But it is a fun place to do a little compass and pace work!<br/>
<br/>
Begin at the Fairborn Park sign (Cold Springs Reserve) on Armstrong.  <br/>
This is the beginning of the Buckeye Trail traverse of the park.  <br/>
Climb all 33 steps to the top of the hill.  5 paces (1 pace = 2 <br/>
steps) past the last step turn to 140 degrees and count paces down <br/>
the all but abandoned trail.   At 54 paces on that trail take an <br/>
intersecting trail with a heading of 80 degrees.  26 paces along that <br/>
trail look right (120 degrees) and 3 paces away you will see a <br/>
triplet Honey Locust (thorn tree).  In the center of that triplet is <br/>
the letterbox.   <br/>
<br/>
Fisherman that I always am, I looked another few paces straight ahead <br/>
on the trail and found a babbling brook.  The occasional passing car <br/>
let me know I was very near where I parked.  It may be easier to <br/>
retrace your steps than to bushwhack back to the car.  I did.  <br/>
