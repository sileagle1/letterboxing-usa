made him a 45 pound dog. He was a great hiker and all the high <br/>
mountain peaks that we placed a letterbox - he was there! Once he got <br/>
tangled up with a porqupine at the Overlook Hotel Letterbox. i think <br/>
he learned from that painful experience of us pulling most of the <br/>
quills out of his face. (The vet got the 3or4 he would'nt let us get <br/>
out from his mouth. He traveled down to our letterbox in Lousianna and <br/>
up to the "bean box" in Maine. (Which we have to replace since it's <br/>
missing" ) .........   at work writting this...got to go...Love &amp; <br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm so sad for you!  You've probably seen this before, and the <br/>
circumstances aren't the same, but it sure made me think of you:<br/>
<br/>
A man and his dog were walking along a road. The man was enjoying <br/>
the scenery, when it suddenly occurred to him that he was dead.   He <br/>
remembered dying, and that the dog walking beside him had been dead <br/>
for years. He wondered where the road was leading them. <br/>
<br/>
After a while, they came to a high, white stone wall along one side <br/>
of the road. It looked like fine marble. At the top of a long hill, <br/>
it was broken by a tall arch that glowed in the sunlight. <br/>
When he was standing before it he saw a magnificent gate in the arch <br/>
that looked like mother-of-pearl, and the street that led to the <br/>
gate looked like pure gold. He and the dog walked toward the gate, <br/>
and as he got closer, he saw a man at a desk to one side. <br/>
<br/>
When he was close enough, he called out, "Excuse me, where are we?" <br/>
<br/>
"This is Heaven, sir," the man answered. <br/>
<br/>
"Wow! Would you happen to have some water?" the man asked. <br/>
<br/>
"Of course, sir. Come right in, and I'll have some ice water brought <br/>
right up." <br/>
<br/>
The man gestured, and the gate began to open. <br/>
<br/>
"Can my friend," gesturing toward his dog, "come in, too?" the <br/>
traveler asked. <br/>
<br/>
"I'm sorry, sir, but we don't accept pets." <br/>
<br/>
The man thought a moment and then turned back toward the road and <br/>
continued the way he had been going with his dog. <br/>
<br/>
After another long walk, and at the top of another long hill, he <br/>
came to a dirt road leading through a farm gate that looked as if it <br/>
had never been closed. There was no fence. <br/>
<br/>
As he approached the gate, he saw a man inside, leaning against a <br/>
tree and reading a book. <br/>
<br/>
"Excuse me!" he called to the man. "Do you have any water?" <br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, sure, there's a pump over there, come on in." <br/>
<br/>
"How about my friend here?" the traveler gestured to the dog. <br/>
<br/>
"There should be a bowl by the pump." <br/>
<br/>
They went through the gate, and sure enough, there was an old-<br/>
fashioned hand pump with a bowl beside it. <br/>
<br/>
The traveler filled the water bowl and took a long drink himself, <br/>
then he gave some to the dog. <br/>
<br/>
When they were full, he and the dog walked back toward the man who <br/>
was standing by the tree. <br/>
<br/>
"What do you call this place?" the traveler asked. <br/>
<br/>
"This is Heaven," he answered. <br/>
<br/>
"Well, that's confusing," the traveler said. "The man down the road <br/>
said that was Heaven, too." <br/>
<br/>
"Oh, you mean the place with the gold street and pearly gates? Nope. <br/>
That's hell." <br/>
<br/>
"Doesn't it make you mad for them to use your name like that?" <br/>
<br/>
"No, we're just happy that they screen out the folks who would leave <br/>
their best friends behind." <br/>
<br/>

Subject: [LBNA] Letterboxing Christmas without Bud<br/>
<br/>
Bud was a pure cocker spaniel. He was the "pick of the litter" which made<br/>
him a 45 pound dog. He was a great hiker and all the high mountain peaks<br/>
that we placed a letterbox - he was there! Once he got tangled up with a<br/>
porqupine at the Overlook Hotel Letterbox. i think he learned from that<br/>
painful experience of us pulling most of the quills out of his face. (The<br/>
vet got the 3or4 he would'nt let us get out from his mouth. He traveled down<br/>
to our letterbox in Lousianna and up to the "bean box" in Maine. (Which we<br/>
have to replace since it's <br/>
missing" ) .........   at work writting this...got to go...Love &amp; <br/>
Peace ....... budster(2) of the Catskills .... <br/>

circumstances aren't the same, but it sure made me think of you:<br/>
<br/>
A man and his dog were walking along a road. The man was enjoying <br/>
the scenery, when it suddenly occurred to him that he was dead. He <br/>
remembered dying, and that the dog walking beside him had been dead <br/>
for years. He wondered where the road was leading them. <br/>
<br/>
After a while, they came to a high, white stone wall along one side <br/>
of the road. It looked like fine marble. At the top of a long hill, <br/>
it was broken by a tall arch that glowed in the sunlight. <br/>
When he was standing before it he saw a magnificent gate in the arch <br/>
that looked like mother-of-pearl, and the street that led to the <br/>
gate looked like pure gold. He and the dog walked toward the gate, <br/>
and as he got closer, he saw a man at a desk to one side. <br/>
<br/>
When he was close enough, he called out, "Excuse me, where are we?" <br/>
<br/>
"This is Heaven, sir," the man answered. <br/>
<br/>
"Wow! Would you happen to have some water?" the man asked. <br/>
<br/>
"Of course, sir. Come right in, and I'll have some ice water brought <br/>
right up." <br/>
<br/>
The man gestured, and the gate began to open. <br/>
<br/>
"Can my friend," gesturing toward his dog, "come in, too?" the <br/>
traveler asked. <br/>
<br/>
"I'm sorry, sir, but we don't accept pets." <br/>
<br/>
The man thought a moment and then turned back toward the road and <br/>
continued the way he had been going with his dog. <br/>
<br/>
After another long walk, and at the top of another long hill, he <br/>
came to a dirt road leading through a farm gate that looked as if it <br/>
had never been closed. There was no fence. <br/>
<br/>
As he approached the gate, he saw a man inside, leaning against a <br/>
tree and reading a book. <br/>
<br/>
"Excuse me!" he called to the man. "Do you have any water?" <br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, sure, there's a pump over there, come on in." <br/>
<br/>
"How about my friend here?" the traveler gestured to the dog. <br/>
<br/>
"There should be a bowl by the pump." <br/>
<br/>
They went through the gate, and sure enough, there was an old-<br/>
fashioned hand pump with a bowl beside it. <br/>
<br/>
The traveler filled the water bowl and took a long drink himself, <br/>
then he gave some to the dog. <br/>
<br/>
When they were full, he and the dog walked back toward the man who <br/>
was standing by the tree. <br/>
<br/>
"What do you call this place?" the traveler asked. <br/>
<br/>
"This is Heaven," he answered. <br/>
<br/>
"Well, that's confusing," the traveler said. "The man down the road <br/>
said that was Heaven, too." <br/>
<br/>
"Oh, you mean the place with the gold street and pearly gates? Nope. <br/>
That's hell." <br/>
<br/>
"Doesn't it make you mad for them to use your name like that?" <br/>
<br/>
"No, we're just happy that they screen out the folks who would leave <br/>
their best friends behind." <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

          O such a sad tale to send out to all in Letterbox Land, <br/>
<br/>
Bud is in doggie heaven looking down at us all , cheering us on to <br/>
enjoy one of our favorite past-times. Bud went out with a smile <br/>
knowing he journied with us all around , sniffing the trails and <br/>
tails, and living to 91yrs (in a dogs life). <br/>
<br/>
To bad our two cats, Smokie and Spot,are restricted to our home plot.<br/>
<br/>
In the Spring we will find a new friend to share the hikes again <br/>
with. ......... Peace and Love... budster(2) of the Catskills <br/>
