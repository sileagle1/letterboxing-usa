                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went out this morning to put a new logbook in Muskrat Ramble and instead <br/>
found the box vandalized and the logbook and stamp gone. The camouflage <br/>
cover had been thrown in a nearby swamp, the book and stamp removed, <br/>
and the box carefully closed and then also tossed in the swamp. Luckily, I had <br/>
checked it just a few weeks ago and had the pleasure of reading the <br/>
wonderful entries made this past winter and spring. Thank you all who took <br/>
the time to write them. This was my second letterbox, planted in 2002. I will be <br/>
making a new Muskrat Ramble, and when I find a less-vulnerable location I <br/>
will let you know.<br/>
