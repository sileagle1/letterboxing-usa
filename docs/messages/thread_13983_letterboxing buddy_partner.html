boxes on my way shopping.  Located the SE School, Happy Birthday, <br/>
Bonus Box at SE School, Under the Pines and the Ye Olde Cemetery.  <br/>
Finally got my first "Chuck and Molly" letterbox (love your <br/>
website).  I am off to a good start for a newbie!<br/>
<br/>
However, it does make me a little nervous to go to some of these <br/>
locations by myself.  How does one find a letterbox buddy to hike <br/>
with them.  I sometimes bring the kids, but would also enjoy as an <br/>
adult hobby. My husband is NOT interested. I do have a friend who has <br/>
just started as well but our schedules don't match very well. <br/>
<br/>
It just seems as though there are some great letterboxing pairs out <br/>
there and I wonder which came first.  Did some of you firends who <br/>
both started this hobby, or were you letterboxers who happened to <br/>
find another lb and paired up?  Just curious. <br/>

My mother-in-law hooked me on the hobby.  She lives in Georgia, and I'm in Michigan, so we only get to box together three or four times a year.  The rest of the time, I pout and flutter my eyelashes and drag my husband along.  He reluctantly came along for the first year, but slowly he's gotten more interested.  So much so the cutie carved his own personal stamp and had me buy him a log book.  Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could lure your husband out on the pretext of fresh air?  The letterboxing not being the (stated) reason for the outing?  Maybe he'll come around, too.  Hey, I'm all for subterfuge if it gets me more boxes!<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The first time I went with someone else (when my ex and I broke up) was when <br/>
I hooked up with Letterboxer2002 for boxing in Mansfield.  I don't exactly <br/>
remember who initiated the conversation and the idea on meeting up to box, <br/>
however, I had never met L2002 before and we decided to go out to Mansfield to box <br/>
one Saturday morning.  A week later, I was talking with Butterfly and Bluebird <br/>
and asked if I could tag along when they went out to do the Christmas in <br/>
Bethlehem series (or was it the other way around???  I remember really wanting to <br/>
do them too).  And that is when I friendship was born!  I had met Butterfly and <br/>
Bluebird previously at an event, and we had been exchanging e-mails for a <br/>
month or so, before we were able to hook up to box.<br/>
<br/>
I also box a lot by myself, and there have been some places that have totally <br/>
freaked me out (not the conventional places however, like the Nike Missile <br/>
Site).  That's when I usually ask someone to tag along.  Most letterboxers would <br/>
be happy to tag along with you, especially if they haven't done that box.<br/>
<br/>
BTW... I would be more than happy to go letterboxing with you!  I'm currently <br/>
on summer vacation and there are weeks where can go almost any time.  All you <br/>
have to do is ask :-)<br/>

I teach rubber stamping and heard about letterboxing at a local rubber stamp store (The Stamp Studio in Manchester) which has its own box!!  It's perfect - Tom is my "nature boy" and can identify most species of trees, poison ivy, bird, etc.  He even knew what to do when we crossed paths with a skunk early one morning (walk backwards slowly but don't take your eyes off the skunk)!  We've been having a ball!<br/>
