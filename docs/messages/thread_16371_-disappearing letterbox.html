Long Island Greenbelt's 25th Anniversary.  My friend &amp; her grandson found the <br/>
box &amp; he was very excited &amp; wanted more.  We have so few letterboxs on LI. In <br/>
August my friend from church wanted something special to do with her son and of <br/>
course, I suggested she check letterboxing.  He too was excited &amp; wanted this <br/>
to be his &amp; his mom' s secret.  <br/>
Today, I went to Blydenburgh Park in Smithtown to check my box.  It was gone. <br/>
<br/>
Just disappeared. No trace. Gone.  It was a terrible feeling and very <br/>
depressing.  I didn't even get to post the box.  I wanted to give our members in the <br/>
LI Greenbelt ( a hiking group) a head start.  <br/>
So I'm a little down tonight.<br/>
