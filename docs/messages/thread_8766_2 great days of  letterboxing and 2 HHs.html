                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a great weekend letterboxing.  On Saturday Disclava and I went <br/>
to Claud Moor Park and picked the first 3 stamps in Froggy went a <br/>
courtin' and also picked up a Honda road again HH.  Then on Sunday We <br/>
went letterboxing with 2 of our friends, someone's elses star and <br/>
Chief and found all 3 letterboxes at Sugarloaf MT.  The first blazes <br/>
was missing a box and a log book.  Disclava and I put to gether some <br/>
paper to make a makeshift log book and added a second plastic bag <br/>
stamp was in good shape though.  We found the other 2 boxes there <br/>
and had a fun time of it.  We also found another HH Tiel.  It was <br/>
Somone elses star's first HH.  We will take the HH to another good <br/>
location.<br/>
