Parker Memorial Park, Westfield MA <br/>
(Hampden County) <br/>
<br/>
Placed: October 3, 2003 by TehutiKa, AsetKa and kids,<br/>
and Rayne and Gillian, too!<br/>
Distance: Irrelevant<br/>
Time: 15 Minutes<br/>
Difficulty: Easy <br/>
<br/>
Parker Memorial Park is on West Silver St., across<br/>
from Westfield Middle School South.<br/>
<br/>
Parker Memorial Park is a small urban park dedicated<br/>
to military personell from previous wars. There are<br/>
multiple monuments on the grounds, from conflicts as<br/>
recent as Vietnam all the way back to the Revolution.<br/>
This box is dedicated to all of the men and women from<br/>
Westfield that served their country.<br/>
<br/>
As you walk into the park, you will see a fountain<br/>
towards the back. During the winter months, this<br/>
fountain is closed down. To the right of the fountain,<br/>
slightly behind it, is a pair of trees that have bent<br/>
over backwards for each other. Standing next to these<br/>
trees, with the trees on your left, walk straight<br/>
ahead 15 steps. Directly on your left will be a<br/>
retaining wall for the fountain. Under the top lip of<br/>
rock, concealed by a rock and a piece of moss, is the<br/>
box. Please rehide this box very carefully. You'll<br/>
understand when you see the hiding spot. It is<br/>
practically the only place in the entire park that<br/>
could conceal a box for any length of time. Happy Hunting!<br/>
