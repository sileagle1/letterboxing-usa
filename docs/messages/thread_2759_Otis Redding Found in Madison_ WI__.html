Last summer I went backpacking in one of the swampier sections of the<br/>
Boundary Waters Canoeing Area.  The bugs were so horrible I was<br/>
tempted to place a letterbox there.  Instead of cryptic clues it would<br/>
be "The letterbox is in plain sight at the intersection of the<br/>
trails.  If you can get there alive with all the bugs you shouldn't<br/>
need to worry about clues." :)<br/>

&gt; Hi! I just found my first box--Otis Redding--in Madison, WI.<br/>
Unfortunately,<br/>
&gt; I think this is the ONLY box left in Madison. I will be carving some<br/>
stamps<br/>
&gt; and hope to get at least 2 boxes planted soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This was a wonderful stamp, Deb! The only thing is, I would not recommend<br/>
&gt; hunting for it at the height of the biting insect season (now)--I think<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; have made your hiding spot their headquarters and they were not pleased to<br/>
&gt; see me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But--it was neat to see that there is a natural stamping shelf available<br/>
&gt; right there, too. I had to really hustle and did not get a chance to copy<br/>
&gt; down the names of folks who already visited the box, but there were<br/>
several.<br/>
&gt; I also did not get a chance to appreciate the different stamps they used.<br/>
In<br/>
&gt; fact, I did not even LOOK at the impression of Otis that I took until I<br/>
got<br/>
&gt; home. I'm telling you the bugs were BAD!!<br/>
