Had the clues for both Fudrick and dvn2r ckr boxes.<br/>
<br/>
The first hitch was that the gate was closed and locked.<br/>
We parked, blocking the exit gate and walked in.<br/>
<br/>
Then we see the guys all wearing the same kind of clothes and realize it's a<br/>
penal work party in cleaning up the place.<br/>
They were picking up debris, actually sweeping some places, and hauling it off<br/>
into the woods and discarding it.<br/>
We saw only one guard, and he didn't seem too concerned about us being there,<br/>
but kept an eye.<br/>
We decided to venture (sneak) in and grab a couple boxes anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Got to Fudrick's Burfoot boxes, but not to dvn2r ckr's.<br/>
Decided not to push our luck with the man.<br/>
Both Burfoot boxes are alive and well and yielded 4 HH each - it was crowded,<br/>
but we managed to find a place for all the HHs in our pack.<br/>
<br/>
Think I'll start a collection bag for Amanda to take back East her next trip.<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
We have to catch the Adventure Seeker's clues next trip.<br/>

Both Nailhead and Happymom roared with laughter at that!  <br/>
Nailhead is afraid to let me post this for fear of being thought of <br/>
as a serial poster.  He thinks we should have sent a private <br/>
email.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm a moderator for a forum somewhere else so, I'm familiar with <br/>
debates and such.  Everyone's got opinions.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people's toes are more tender than others.  <br/>
<br/>
There's nothing wrong with a good debate, you know, but you all <br/>
have talent.  My thoughts are that we're all in this at different <br/>
stages ranging from amateur to probably almost professional  <br/>
(?)  We're going to learn as we go the letterboxing and the forum <br/>
ettiquette.  It just takes a bit of patience on all sides-some <br/>
people more than others (meant sincerely).  It's nice when we <br/>
can discuss a topic without the fear that people are going to get <br/>
really offended.  I mean, come on.  We're all adults aren't we?<br/>
<br/>
Nailhead's afraid that somehow Evil Glenn is going to get <br/>
blamed for this.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I enjoy letterboxing and I enjoy reading the posts here <br/>
almost as much.  I enjoy the carving and creating of boxes.  Our <br/>
family enjoys it too!  We're greatful that we found the hobby.  It's <br/>
been a fun thing that's kind of given us something to do when we <br/>
have time we're not working or doing other busy stuff.<br/>
<br/>
That's all.<br/>
