<blockquote>Hi all -<br/>
<br/>
I've been lurking on the list for a few weeks and finally had a chance to find my first letterbox yesterday, so I thought it was time to introduce myself and say "Hi."<br/>
<br/>
My six year old son and I stopped at the Prayer Rock Letterbox in Bristol, VT, on our way home from Lake Champlain to our house in Northeast Vermont. The box is a great first find (easy, but not too easy) and remains in good shape. It was nice to see the stamps of some of the folks I see posting here or whose websites I've visited. My six year old's first question was "Where's MY stamp?", and his second question was "Can we find another one?"  (His third question was "Can we have ice cream now?")<br/>
<br/>
I have already picked out three spots to drop letterboxes, but am having trouble carving the stamps (they look great when I sketch them out, but the carvings don't look quite as good -- maybe I'm just too fussy). I think I need a larger stamp!  Northern New England letterboxers should stay tuned, as I will soon be placing boxes in Caledonia County, Vermont. I also travel on business quite often, and so will get a chance to hunt (and hide) boxes in many areas of the country (I'm looking forward to having something to do with downtime while on business trips -- hiking and perhaps learning a little about the local area sure beats sitting in a hotel room watching TV). <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings from Monkton!<br/>
<br/>
    The Prayer Rock box was the first placed by Erik &amp; myself and,<br/>
arguably, the first box placed by this group.  Be sure to visit the two<br/>
at the ApGap and the five at Sherburne Pass.  If boating is in your<br/>
summer, Butler Island, Valcour Island, and a few others.  Some of the<br/>
Lake Champlain boxes are listed in New York.  Down the Interstate are<br/>
some boxes in the Randolph area.  One is so sneaky we will need to make<br/>
a return trip to find it!  Can't wait to search a few more, boxes are a<br/>
bit thin up here in Vermont.<br/>
<br/>
    On the rubber stamp front:  simple is best to begin with.  White<br/>
vinyl erasers are the easiest to carve.  Try a speedball linoleum cutter<br/>
set but watch the six year old, the blades are very sharp.  The artgum<br/>
eraser and butter knife approach is probably safer for him.  A star, a<br/>
moon, or a shape cut from one of those little cookie cutters for<br/>
appetizers is an easy approach for a younger one and the shape being the<br/>
stamp makes positioning it a sure bet.  The speedball cutters are<br/>
available from Artists Mediums in Williston (just off I-89) and<br/>
Boutelier's in Burlington (downtown).  You might check out a Ben<br/>
Franklin store or any serious artists shop.  The new light pink<br/>
speedball carving medium is pretty good and comes packaged as a starter<br/>
set with some of the cutters at AM.  Don't let anyone sell you PZ cut as<br/>
it is very crumbly (although the prayer rock stamp seems to have held<br/>
up, it was extremely difficult to carve).  At AM is a large white vinyl<br/>
eraser by the name of Factis, pricey at about $2 but very nice to carve<br/>
and a good size for a box.  It is thick enough to not require a mounting<br/>
block which makes things a bit easier.  Look for surface flaws BEFORE<br/>
you begin carving.  You can get a smooth, even surface by lightly<br/>
sanding the eraser on a fine grit sandpaper like black oxide, 400 grit.<br/>
<br/>
    The only way to make a carved stamp is to just keep at it.  And at<br/>
it.  One way of controlling edges is to carve the image to within about<br/>
1/16" of the edge and as a final step, cut off the edge at a 45 angle.<br/>
This will prevent a lot of tear outs.  Also, remember to sharpen your<br/>
blade frequently during a carve.  A piece of sandpaper works pretty<br/>
well, a stone is a bit better.<br/>
An emery board can be used in a pinch!<br/>
<br/>
    Anxiously awaiting some clues!<br/>

All of those boxes in Braintree/Randolph are next on my list (after a short<br/>
business trip this week to Louisville, Kentucky, where I see there are 2<br/>
letterboxes to be found). And then there are those boxes on Valcour Island I<br/>
want to get (I have a sailboat on Lake Champlain), and then a trip to Tampa,<br/>
where I see there are a few boxes, and then . . . and then . . .<br/>
