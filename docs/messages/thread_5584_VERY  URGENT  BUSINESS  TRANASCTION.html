(VERY URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION)<br/>
<br/>
Dear  sir<br/>
In order to transfer out (US$ 90million) Ninety<br/>
million United States Dollars) from African<br/>
Development Bank.  I have picked-up the trust and<br/>
courage to ask you to look for a reliable and honest<br/>
person who will be capable for this important business<br/>
transaction believing that you will never let me down<br/>
either now or in the future.<br/>
My name is Mr.PETER BENSON, the chief Auditor Officer of<br/>
African Development bank (ADB). There is an account<br/>
opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has<br/>
operated on this account again. After going through<br/>
some old files in the records, I discovered that if I<br/>
do not remit this money out urgently it would be<br/>
forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is<br/>
Mr. Fernando Carlos, a foreigner, he was a miner at<br/>
Kruger gold company, a geologist by profession, and he<br/>
died since 1990. No other person knows about this<br/>
account or any thing concerning it, the account has no<br/>
other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as<br/>
well that this company does not know anything about<br/>
this account and the amount involved is (US$90<br/>
million) Ninety million United States Dollars. I want<br/>
to first transfer (US$45M) Forty Five million united<br/>
states Dollars from this money into a safe foreigners<br/>
account abroad before the rest. I am contacting you<br/>
based on the fact that you are a foreigner because<br/>
this money can only be approved for payment to a<br/>
foreigner, more so it can not be approved by any local<br/>
bank here, as this money is in US Dollars hence the<br/>
former owner of this account is a foreigner too. I<br/>
know that this proposal will come to you as a surprise<br/>
as we don't know ourselves before, however I based my<br/>
move on trust and God directive and we will still have<br/>
to meet possibly, sign some agreement before the final<br/>
transfer of the fund into any of your<br/>
chosendesignatedbank account.<br/>
Please treat with utmost confidentiality.<br/>
<br/>
Expecting your urgent response.<br/>

&gt; &gt; (VERY URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dear  sir<br/>
&gt; &gt; In order to transfer out (US$ 90million) Ninety<br/>
&gt; &gt; million United States Dollars) from African<br/>
&gt; &gt; Development Bank.  I have picked-up the trust and<br/>
&gt; &gt; courage to ask you to look for a reliable and<br/>
&gt; honest<br/>
&gt; &gt; person who will be capable for this important<br/>
&gt; business<br/>
&gt; &gt; transaction believing that you will never let me<br/>
&gt; down<br/>
&gt; &gt; either now or in the future.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My name is Mr.PETER BENSON, the chief Auditor<br/>
&gt; Officer<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; African Development bank (ADB). There is an<br/>
&gt; account<br/>
&gt; &gt; opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody<br/>
&gt; has<br/>
&gt; &gt; operated on this account again. After going<br/>
&gt; through<br/>
&gt; &gt; some old files in the records, I discovered that<br/>
&gt; if I<br/>
&gt; &gt; do not remit this money out urgently it would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mr. Fernando Carlos, a foreigner, he was a miner<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kruger gold company, a geologist by profession,<br/>
&gt; and he<br/>
&gt; &gt; died since 1990. No other person knows about this<br/>
&gt; &gt; account or any thing concerning it, the account<br/>
&gt; has no<br/>
&gt; &gt; other beneficiary and my investigation proved to<br/>
&gt; me as<br/>
&gt; &gt; well that this company does not know anything<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; this account and the amount involved is (US$90<br/>
&gt; &gt; million) Ninety million United States Dollars. I<br/>
&gt; want<br/>
&gt; &gt; to first transfer (US$45M) Forty Five million<br/>
&gt; united<br/>
&gt; &gt; states Dollars from this money into a safe<br/>
&gt; foreigners<br/>
&gt; &gt; account abroad before the rest. I am contacting<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; based on the fact that you are a foreigner because<br/>
&gt; &gt; this money can only be approved for payment to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; foreigner, more so it can not be approved by any<br/>
&gt; local<br/>
&gt; &gt; bank here, as this money is in US Dollars hence<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; former owner of this account is a foreigner too. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; know that this proposal will come to you as a<br/>
&gt; surprise<br/>
&gt; &gt; as we don't know ourselves before, however I based<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; move on trust and God directive and we will still<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to meet possibly, sign some agreement before the<br/>
&gt; final<br/>
&gt; &gt; transfer of the fund into any of your<br/>
&gt; &gt; chosendesignatedbank account.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Please treat with utmost confidentiality.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Expecting your urgent response.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Best Regards,<br/>
&gt; &gt; PETER BENSON<br/>
