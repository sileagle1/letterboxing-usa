Steilacoom<br/>
Pierce County<br/>
Washington<br/>
<br/>
Level of difficulty: Level to steep dirt/gravel trail (portions are <br/>
mucky in rainy season). <br/>
<br/>
Setting: Originally known as the Steilacoom River, this drainage <br/>
became known as Chambers Creek after an early pioneer who owned the <br/>
land surrounding the stream. Thomas Chambers took advantage of the <br/>
stream's water power to build a series of mills (beginning with <br/>
Pierce County's first grist mill in 1850) at the mouth of the creek. <br/>
The often-steep trail climbs up the valley ending in a neighborhood; <br/>
trail spurs lead down toward the wetlands or up to other houses on <br/>
the ridge. <br/>
<br/>
Highlights: This beautiful glen and estuary provide a rare haven to <br/>
many different types of wildlife, including salmon. Salal and sword <br/>
ferns carpet the lush hillside, and the trunks of the big-leaf <br/>
maples are festooned with licorice ferns. The mixed woods of <br/>
conifers (several Douglas firs reach three-to-four feet in diameter) <br/>
and maples allows a more open forest walk during the winter, when <br/>
the stream wetlands are more visible. For more park information, <br/>
call 253-798-4177. <br/>
<br/>
Facilities: None. Oh--there is a portapotty but I can't guarantee <br/>
that it's clean or even if it's standing up!  Recently, it was <br/>
knocked over...  ;(<br/>
<br/>
Restrictions: Leash and scoop laws in effect for pets. <br/>
<br/>
Length of trek:  approx. 1 mile roundtrip, 25 minutes roundtrip for <br/>
the athletic folks <br/>
<br/>
Directions: This is the direct route (I highly recommend you take <br/>
the scenic route, though):  From southbound Interstate 5 south of <br/>
Tacoma, take Exit 129 (stay in the right-hand exit lane) and turn <br/>
right (west) onto South 74th Street. From Interstate 5 northbound, <br/>
take Exit 129 and turn left on South 72nd Street (which soon becomes <br/>
South 74th). <br/>
<br/>
About a half mile after South 74th Street turns into Custer Road <br/>
West, turn right on Bridgeport Way West. Turn left on Chambers Lane <br/>
West, which turns into Chambers Creek Road West. Across from a <br/>
cemetery, turn left to follow Chambers Creek Road West down into the <br/>
stream valley. After you cross the road over the bay, park on the <br/>
shoulder, and the trailhead is across the road. <br/>
<br/>
Scenic Route directions:  From North or South Interstate 5, take <br/>
Exit 119 Steilacoom/DuPont.  Head West over railroad tracks, then <br/>
turn right on Steilacoom Highway.  Take this road for about 6 <br/>
miles.  You will drive through parts of North Fort Lewis that will <br/>
eventually take you through the quaint seaside village of <br/>
Steilacoom.  Continue on the same road until you approach the line <br/>
for the ferry, turn right on Lafayette Street and continue through <br/>
downtown Steilacoom until the road appears to leave the village <br/>
area.  It will veer down toward Sunnyside Beach along the water and <br/>
the railroad tracks.  Continue on the same road past a large <br/>
recycling plant on the right side of the road.  About  mile from <br/>
the recycling plant, you will notice the Chambers Creek Fish trap on <br/>
your left (the West side of the road).  There will be a large lake <br/>
like area with a dam, fish ladder, gravel parking area, picnic table <br/>
and a sign that describes the various fish that spawn in the area.  <br/>
Park here or on the other side of the street.  The entrance to <br/>
Chambers Creek Park is pretty well hidden from traffic so keep your <br/>
eyes posted for this. <br/>
<br/>
BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL CROSSING THE ROAD HERE AS CARS TRAVEL QUITE <br/>
QUICKLY ALONG THIS ROADalthough it's posted as 35 mph.  IT'S ALSO A <br/>
BLIND CORNER FOR VEHICLES COMING FROM THE NORTH NEAR THE BRIDGE SO <br/>
BE EXTRA CAUTIOUS AS YOU CROSS THE STREET.<br/>
