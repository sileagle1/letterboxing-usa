                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's official, the First Texas Letterboxing Event<br/>
will take place on Saturday, March 6, 2004, at<br/>
Bastrop State Park near Austin.  I reserved the<br/>
Group Picnic Pavilion in the Copperas Creek<br/>
Campground and we will meet there starting at<br/>
11:00 am.  We can meet, exchange stamps, swap<br/>
stories and eat for however long we want, then<br/>
go letterboxing in the park.  There are currently<br/>
7 boxes in the park and 2 nearby, not to mention<br/>
several in the Austin area.  Feel free to place<br/>
your own boxes when you come and share the clues<br/>
with us so we can hunt for them that day.  I plan<br/>
to bring a crock pot of chili, bowls and spoons.<br/>
Everyone can bring their own drinks and any food<br/>
they want to share.  The Pavilion has electric<br/>
outlets and a fireplace, with bathrooms nearby.<br/>
It is also covered, so rain or shine the event<br/>
will go on.  Baby Bear is carving the Event stamp<br/>
that will only be available to participants of<br/>
this historic event, so come be a part of it!<br/>
For directions and more information about the park,<br/>
go to:<br/>

<br/>
If you plan to camp in the park, you should make<br/>
reservations soon since it is a very popular place.<br/>
If you plan to stay in Austin, it is only about<br/>
30 minutes away.<br/>
Please R.S.V.P. to me so I have an idea how many to<br/>
expect.  Hope to see you there!<br/>
