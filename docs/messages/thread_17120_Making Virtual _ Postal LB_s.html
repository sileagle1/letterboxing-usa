I was going to suggest the virtual letterboxes on the bottom of the<br/>
map at http://www.letterboxing.org/america.htm  but it appears that the<br/>
Virtual, International, and Hitchhiker buttons have been disabled. <br/>
So, you'll have to get them off the old site at<br/>
http://www.rpmrlm.com:1020/lbna/virtual/virtual.htm  Can someone<br/>
reconnect the buttons on the new site?  Perhaps the HH link should be<br/>
to Pete and Wanda's page seeing as it's more up to date?<br/>
<br/>
As for postal boxes, this is the list to watch.  When one gets<br/>
announced, sign up for it by following whatever directions are in the<br/>
post.<br/>
<br/>
And as long as we're on the subject, I'd like to start collecting<br/>
puzzle boxes.  I don't care where they are physically located, I just<br/>
want the puzzles to solve over the cold winter months.  For examples<br/>
of what I'm talking about check out Dalliance in Western NY and Ra Ra<br/>
Ra in Mystery MA.  I've already written to Sir B. for copies of his<br/>
Lord of the Rings series and I've already solved Orient Express at the<br/>
Kimball Library in VT.  Any others?  Semaphore, Braille, Sign<br/>
Language, Secret Codes, Rebuses, I'll try them all!!!  I'm willing <br/>
to keep a list on my website for anyone else who wants to try their<br/>
hand at puzzles.  Send the LB name and state location (or the actual<br/>
link) to dagonell@hotmail.com and I'll post it to my website.<br/>

&gt; Can you also give me some ideas on how I would go about making my own? My<br/>
oldest daughter who is 12 has decided she really enjoys carving the stamps.<br/>
<br/>
For Team Rayvenhaus, the virtual letterboxes comprise 2 categories. Either a<br/>
stamp we have carved and digitized an image of, or an already digitized<br/>
image. Once we have that, then we go off in search of websites that pertain<br/>
to the image to build the clues from, asking questions, making the person<br/>
work to figure them out, and then have a url that points to my webserver<br/>
where the image resides and then they can download it for their virtual<br/>
logbook.<br/>
<br/>
(We've made a logbook where we print out the image and place it there, just<br/>
like we stamped in)<br/>
<br/>
As far as postal letterboxes, each is individual. The Aztec Gold we just<br/>
sent out was a massive undertaking in my not so humble opinion. Once people<br/>
see it, I hope they'll love it as much as we do.  We came up with the 'Curse<br/>
of the Black Pearl' series here in Washington, which we are starting to<br/>
plant now and felt that we could share the finished stamp with people that<br/>
might not every get a chance to see it.  So we built a container for it, and<br/>
a few other things and made mention of a new PLB starting up, asking for<br/>
names and addresses, off list, of any that wanted to join in and we got 72<br/>
people before the closing date. So, we packaged it up and shipped it off.<br/>
<br/>
I'd suggest, and this is only a suggestion, that you pick something that you<br/>
like, whatever theme, carve the stamp, get it and it's log book ready to<br/>
handle the US Postal system and then announce it here.  Then get ready to<br/>
not see it for a year or so.  (grin)<br/>
