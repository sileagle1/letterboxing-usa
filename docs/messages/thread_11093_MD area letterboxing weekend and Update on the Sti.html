                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good weather this weekend.  Admittedly, I spent most<br/>
of the time climbing, but we still managed to get some<br/>
letterboxing done.  <br/>
<br/>
1.  Checked on the greenbelt coffeefish.  It's still<br/>
there.  So far only one stamp but from visitors from<br/>
very far away.<br/>
<br/>
2.  went out to rocky gorge and got dogpaddle beach<br/>
and the fishing one by the beaver dam.  Realized after<br/>
we saw them that we probably missed the opportunity<br/>
for an exchange with the 4 people walking up the hill<br/>
as we were walking down.  Which is unfortunate because<br/>
dead duck chuck has the best stamp we've ever seen (a<br/>
weehedgehog running close 2nd).  We either misread the<br/>
directions or couldn't find the 3rd box for all the<br/>
snow.  footprints would indicate that we were in a<br/>
similar predicament as others.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Replaced the Stinkeye.  It was actually not<br/>
missing when it was reported missing, just under the<br/>
snow.  We found it after the snow melted.  We took it<br/>
away so we could replace it later after all the snow<br/>
was gone.  It's now in the same place wedged under a<br/>
rock.  Definitely a hard box to do at night when all<br/>
the college types are buying their potato chips at the<br/>
wa-wa.  :)<br/>
