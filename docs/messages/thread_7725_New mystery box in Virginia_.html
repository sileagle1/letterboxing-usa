Meadow Sky wanted to send postcards and stamps from Paris to all her <br/>
Letterboxing friends but she couldn't afford the trip.  Her friend, <br/>
Johnny Mosby had a great idea.  The solution cost her 4.00, but that <br/>
she could afford!  She took her camera with her on the adventure and <br/>
she was very glad she did!<br/>
