                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well after looking at the Orient Express clues for Vt. a mystery has<br/>
been solved.  After the big get together a while back and all the talk<br/>
about the pub and the beer and fiddle music, I now know what. why, and<br/>
where you folks were talking about. Which brings a question about the<br/>
Long Trail,  are horses allowed on it. It sounds as tho it is state or<br/>
maybe federal land, if so then how much is open to horse back riding.<br/>
Can anyone tell me please.  sounds like a beautiful part of the state.<br/>

On the other hand, there are a wealth of dirt roads with a fair amount<br/>
of horse travel on them.  I'll talk to my friend who breeds Trahkeners<br/>
(sp?) about some of the trail systems, I know she has been working with<br/>
a group locally in the Champlain Valley.  Get a map, find BUrlington &amp;<br/>
Middlebury then look 1/2 way between and find Bristol snuggled up<br/>
against the mountains.  We're in Monkton which probably isn't on the map<br/>
but is northwest of Bristol. You may have provided some inspiration for<br/>
a series!<br/>

Oh, how true. Now I'm sure Tom will weigh in on this with the poop on<br/>
horse access to the Long Trail, since he has walked all 300 miles of<br/>
it, but Susan is right. That is one hard core, bone jangling, rocky<br/>
ridge of New England there. We hiked both sides of Smuggler's Notch<br/>
several years ago, and it was straight up, hand over hand, in a massive<br/>
confusion of house sized boulders. And there is evidence everywhere of<br/>
those monsters rolling around. If a glacial erratic falls off a cliff<br/>
in Vermont and a horse is there to see it, will it still get squashed?<br/>
<br/>
Go on up anyway and have a poke around! It's marvelous! Jay<br/>
