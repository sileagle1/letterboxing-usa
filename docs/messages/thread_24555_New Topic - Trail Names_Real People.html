I have been thinking about this for a while....<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if anyone has ever discovered that someone they know in real life<br/>
is actually a fellow letterboxer who's trail name they have seen around,<br/>
perhaps in log books, or online or whereever.<br/>
<br/>
It would just be amazing to discover your boss, or your brother in law, or<br/>
your neighbor is really a lbing secret identity that you've been familiar<br/>
with.<br/>

Any stories??<br/>

When I first discovered letterboxing, I mentioned it to a few friends <br/>
but failed to get them hooked.  Then about a year later, the wife of <br/>
my co-worker read an article on letterboxing and decided to try it <br/>
with her Girl Scouts.  She printed the clues to a local box placed by <br/>
someone named Silver Eagle and planned an outing.  My friend told me <br/>
what his wife was doing and asked if I still participated.  You <br/>
should have seen his face when I told him I was Silver Eagle and it <br/>
was my box they were going after!  I ended up meeting them at the <br/>
park and giving a presentation on letterboxing, which resulted in my <br/>
friend becoming a letterboxer.  I guess just telling him about it was <br/>
not enough, he had to experience letterboxing to be hooked.<br/>

I haven't myself discovered that someone I know was a letterboxer, but I<br/>
have been found out myself by a friend of mine.<br/>
<br/>
I'm very active in Cub Scouts and one of my fellow leaders is married to a<br/>
Girl Scout leader.  My husband and I have known them both for about ten<br/>
years, four of which we've letterboxed.  The Cub Scout Leader knows well<br/>
that I am a letterboxer and even what my trailname is (I've often boxed with<br/>
the boys), but maybe communication isn't so great in their house, because<br/>
she didn't know, except vaguely, that I dabbled in letterboxing and she sure<br/>
didn't know my trail name.<br/>
<br/>
When I heard that their GS troop was getting involved in letterboxing,<br/>
I told the Troop leader I would enjoy going to talk to them about it, or to<br/>
show them how to carve, or whatever.  She herself wasn't real interested in<br/>
letterboxing, but another leader was pushing it, so I'll bet I made offers<br/>
for a year before she finally took me up on it.  As we were chatting about<br/>
her expectations about my talk, I got the distinct idea she had no idea I<br/>
had been letterboxing longer than anyone else who lived in our area and that<br/>
it is a serious hobby for me and my family and that she was basically<br/>
needing to fill a time slot.  She did ask me my trailname and I told her,<br/>
but it didn't mean anything to her for any reason.  However, when I got to<br/>
her house, she opened the door and began laughing - she said "I had no idea<br/>
you were a celebrity", to which I said "Neither did I".  She quickly<br/>
explained that when she told the girls Barefoot Lucy was going to come talk<br/>
to them, they went nuts and kept telling her "She's the one we've been<br/>
telling you about."  "She's logged in to every box we've ever found"  "She's<br/>
planted a bunch of boxes around here".  They were apparently quite impressed<br/>
that she knew me.  Their enthusiasm was more than a little embarassing, but<br/>
the funniest part of it was the look on her face when she answered the door<br/>
and there stood me - Cub Scout leader and old friend, AND the speaker who<br/>
upped her own star power in the eyes of her girl scout troop.<br/>

  first off thank you for a NICE new topic. Secondly Im boring and we didn't ccome up with a trail name for our clan yet. Me and my hubby go alone occasionally but most of the time its with our boys. We did find a box that had the name of a family we know in it and after this we had quite a few smiles and stories together. Since we use our last name to sign any box I guess its not that hard to know we have this hobby.<br/>
  Perhaps when we finally get to putting our own box out there we will come up with a name. <br/>

of four women, doing the same thing. One of them was a local <br/>
letterboxer that I was very excited about meeting. Her three friends <br/>
were mostly humoring her, but so was my friend, so we went around <br/>
the circle and made introductions. When Kathleen said something, the <br/>
accent gave her away. i don't know how i didn't recognize my eighth <br/>
grade english teacher (and arch nemisis!) at first sight. I'm a few <br/>
years older now and she doesn't seem nearly as horrible as she did <br/>
when i was 13. But the whole trip home I could only talk about one <br/>
thing! <br/>
