<br/>
Whew! It's been one hectic week here in Axtown, so I'm only now getting <br/>
around to adding my voice to the chorus of appreciation to Trish and everyone <br/>
else who made last Saturday's gathering in RI such a fun event. Even the <br/>
cold, rainy weather was no match for the warmth generated by everyone who <br/>
attended. Much of my time was spent chatting with veteran and newbie <br/>
letterboxers alike and exchanging stamps, though during a break in the <br/>
weather I did manage - along with Chris (a/k/a CSCM) - to venture over to the <br/>
University of Rhode Island, where we each earned three Degrees in <br/>
Letterboxing via the "Fast Track to Your Degree" series. I even found myself <br/>
with a "Post Doc", my very first hitchhiker (woohoo!), compliments of those <br/>
rascals from RIBNAG.<br/>
<br/>
I upped my "X" count in a big way (approximately 30) and added four event <br/>
stamps as well. But more importantly, the very best part of the gathering was <br/>
visiting with all these nice people, eating lots of wonderful food, swapping <br/>
letterboxing stories, and generally having a good ol' time! This was my <br/>
second letterboxing gathering, and it was every bit as enjoyable as the <br/>
first. I'm already looking forward to the next one.<br/>

&lt;<i <br="" and="" farmington="" for="" greenway="" looking="" north="" south="" the="" valley="" went="">
letterboxes on Sunday. I found the South box with no problem. I was the 1st <br/>
one in it. But when I looked for the North box, I found nothing under the <br/>
rock. Looked like someone had been there before because the grass was <br/>
trampled down.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pat, on Monday morning I too was unsuccessful in finding the North letterbox <br/>
at its anticpated resting place. That evening, I e-mailed Bill Haalck (the <br/>
planter of the box) about its apparent disappearance, and he later confirmed <br/>
that the box was indeed missing. He has subsequently advised me that he has <br/>
hidden a new box in the same location and will be re-posting the clues to the <br/>
Letterboxing list shortly (if he hasn't already done so).<br/>
