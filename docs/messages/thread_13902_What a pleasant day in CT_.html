                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all!  Since today was the last day I could box for a whole week (due to <br/>
my grad school class starting tomorrow), I thought I would go out and do some <br/>
boxing today!  Today was a bit different than other days... I had a theme <br/>
boxing day.  I wanted to find as many Letterboxer2002 boxes as I could!<br/>
<br/>
I started out in Norwalk and found the Norwalk Historical Society and <br/>
Jonathan's Birthday box, (I already have the Buteo one, and I don't think the first <br/>
Disc Golf one has been replaced yet) then headed out to New Fairfield and found <br/>
Woody Woodpecker and Lady of the Lake (YES!!!!!  IT LIVES!).  I also found <br/>
IrishCOD's Fox View Letterbox, and the third of the 3 Boxes in Danbury series.  <br/>
I also found four other boxes that I can't talk about online..... :-)<br/>
<br/>
BTW.... Friday, I hit my 800th box at the Hanging Hiker on the My Favorite <br/>
Musicals loop.  THere were a few boxes that I hadn't gotten from that series, so <br/>
I thought that I would do the loop again.  This time, I was victorious with <br/>
all of the boxes I was looking for, including Spring, Spring Spring, and <br/>
another unpublished box: Love Labour's Lost.<br/>
<br/>
All in all!  A great summer so far!  Too bad I have to go to grad school this <br/>
week.... the weather's supposed to be GREAT!<br/>

box?  We searched forever right before Mothers day...they had JUST <br/>
cut down several trees in the area we "thought" the box was, so we <br/>
eventually gave up and figured it was gone...ARRRRGHHHHHHH<br/>
<br/>
Oh well...<br/>
<br/>
On a happier note, we have found the Cromwell Old burial ground and <br/>
Jack and the beanstalk....Cool stamp by the way!!!<br/>
