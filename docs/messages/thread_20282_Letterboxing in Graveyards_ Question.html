                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently went to a couple of boxes near Wrentham, MA and followed <br/>
the clues through two different, beautiful cemetaries. I had a <br/>
wonderful sense of history, sat and looked at some headstones that <br/>
were loving pieces of art, and felt at peace being in such  <br/>
beautiful places. One of the boxes was a memorial to a friend who <br/>
died way before his time, and we paid our respects at his grave <br/>
before following the clues that lead to the other side of the <br/>
graveyard to a spot under a tree away from the gravesites. I bet it <br/>
gave the placer a great feeling to be close to their friend again. <br/>
The other site was from the 1600's and was fascinating to read the <br/>
inscriptions that weren't worn away. I would definitely feel <br/>
different about boxing and having to move headstones, however!<br/>
