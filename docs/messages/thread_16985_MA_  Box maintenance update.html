                    <div class="plaintext-content">We spent part of yesterday doing "box maintenance" on some of our<br/>
boxes that we hadn't been to in about a year.  Happily, we can report<br/>
that all of the following boxes are in good shape and open for<br/>
business:<br/>
<br/>
In Fairhaven:<br/>
Ft Phoenix <br/>
Toxic Tack<br/>
The Slugger<br/>
<br/>
Along the Cape Cod Canal:<br/>
The Herring Run<br/>
Belmont Rock<br/>
<br/>
We may relist these boxes separately, since it seems that some members<br/>
of the "Seaside Series" have many more visitors than others. Currently<br/>
 each series is listed only under the name of the town in which the<br/>
first box is located.<br/>
<br/>
We checked on boxes in Marion towards the end of summer, and Old<br/>
Landing and Island Wharf were in fine shape.<br/>
<br/>
We also signed into the following boxes yesterday:  Phoenix Bike Trail<br/>
and Cape Cod Canal Trail Letterbox.  Thanks!<br/>
