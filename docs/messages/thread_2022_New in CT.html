Just hurry your behind <br/>

We've been back to the charming little Watch Rock conservation area <br/>

it gives you an excuse to return to the mouth of the Connecticut <br/>

Title: Whimsy Walk<br/>
Lyme, New London County, CT<br/>
Authors: DrewClan<br/>
<br/>
Whimsy Walk<br/>
<br/>
Three letterboxes on an easy 1/2 mile hike in the tiny, jewel-like <br/>
Watch Rock Nature Preserve in Old Lyme, CT. Bring the children and a <br/>
painted rock! From I-95 take exit 70 (and if southbound, follow the <br/>
156 signs past a shopping center and turn left to pass back under the <br/>
freeway), and follow CT Rte. 156 East 1.4 miles. After crossing over <br/>
the railroad tracks, turn right on unmarked Noyes Rd, then <br/>
immediately right again on Caukins. At the end, go left-right onto <br/>
Joel Rd and into the parking area. Hike into the preserve and explore.<br/>
<br/>
Watch Rock Letterbox<br/>
Down in the southwest corner, find a wooded point overlooking <br/>
spartina grass and wild rice with a jutting outcrop of rocks in oak <br/>
and cedar. A tumbled stonewall crosses the river front. Standing on <br/>
the highest point of rock, the largest oak is almost due south: the <br/>
Whimsy Walk Letterbox is in rocks at it's base on the southern side.<br/>
<br/>
Pine bench Letterbox <br/>
In the sanctuary grove find a plank between trunks. <br/>
Sit facing the sunrise and look over your off shoulder <br/>
Just to the left of the trunk. <br/>
<br/>
Northwest Point Letterbox <br/>
Lives an oak,  blown down, and <br/>
To the east on slightly higher ground <br/>
Lives a low ledge of rock behind bramble. <br/>
Find the deer path that loops around <br/>
To the southeast side. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Traveler with a Twist was set free on 12/31/01...  I know it was already <br/>
picked up by Dan and Melissa (and Max too!)  <br/>
<br/>
We also placed a box along the Pachaug Trail in Griswold, CT:<br/>
Maggie's Box<br/>
Directions:  Park in the dirt turnout marked with the blue Pachaug Trail <br/>
sign, north of the intersection between CT Rt 201 and CT Rt 183.<br/>
Length:  no more than an hour.<br/>
Clues:  Follow the VERY well marked blue trail for about 20-30 minutes.  This <br/>
will follow the edge of a woodland marsh before turning left and heading <br/>
uphill.  Eventually you will see a fence post sticking out of a cairn on your <br/>
immediate right.  At 280 degrees from the post you should see a ledge with an <br/>
opening that is bigger than a nook and smaller than a cranny.  Hidden in this <br/>
is Maggie's Letterbox.  You might want to poke it with a stick before <br/>
reaching in...  Its a good hiding spot for critters!<br/>

Drum Song" in East Haddam, Middlesex Co, CT. Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/drewclan/flower.htm<br/>
<br/>
Flower Drum Song<br/>
<br/>
Set in the house of traditional Chinese patriarch Wang Chi Yang in <br/>
our beloved hometown of San Francisco, "Flower Drum Song" is one of <br/>
our favorite Rogers and Hammerstein musicals. This is a wonderful <br/>
comedy with a subject dear to our hearts; the generation gap between <br/>
Old World immigrants who cling to traditional values and their New <br/>
World progeny, who see themselves as Americans and adopt Western <br/>
values and lifestyles.<br/>
Since we couldn't place this series in San Francisco as we first <br/>
intended, we have opted instead to create a walking tour of a <br/>
beautiful Connecticut River town with a well-regarded theater.<br/>
Like the young picture-bride Mei Li and the Westernized Sammy Fong in <br/>
the musical, you must find your way to a distinctly American place: <br/>
in your case it will be East Haddam on the Connecticut River. This <br/>
walk covers about 1 miles and will take less than an hour to <br/>
complete, for three operatic letterboxes.<br/>
Park south of the Goodspeed Opera House in the main lot by the river. <br/>
Look east to a gazebo. From its' Rotarian center, the Goodspeed Opera <br/>
House Letterbox is under the footing at 075.<br/>
Now return to the river and turn north over the footbridge and up the <br/>
stairway between the theater and Gelston House. Walk north up the <br/>
main road and bear left on Rte. 149. You'll soon find the Nathan Hale <br/>
Schoolhouse up a small hill on your left. From the Spencer Memorial, <br/>
find the East Haddam Letterbox under flat stone in the shade of a <br/>
large oak at 132.<br/>
Walking back down Rte. 149 to the corner overlooking the Opera House, <br/>
turn left and walk up Rte. 82. Just opposite Ray Hill Rd you'll find <br/>
a lovely arched bridge on the left that spans Succor Brook. Cross <br/>
over, and then take about twenty steps along your left to a pile of <br/>
rocks and the Succor Brook Letterbox.<br/>
Like all good musical comedies, Flower Drum Song has a happy ending. <br/>
We hope your search was also a theatric success!<br/>
