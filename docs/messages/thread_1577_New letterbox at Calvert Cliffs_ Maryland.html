didn't have much time to focus or letterboxing and make it challenging but it <br/>
is a nice site and maybe others can hid a more difficult box when they look <br/>
for this one. I did see a red headed woodpecker while I was there which was <br/>
very exciting for me. It was to cold to look for sharks teeth but that could <br/>
be fun to do in the summer. Enjoy,<br/>
