<div>Went to look for the Harriman Tracks boxes this 
past weekend. It appears #2 has been vandalized/scattered...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I strayed a bit and got a little bit lost while 
trying to find the first one. Sadly, while I was wandering towards what 
appeared to be the location of one of the other boxes (based on the clues) I 
found the lid for Tracks #2 laying on the ground in the middle of the trail. I 
searched around for the contents, but couldn't find the stamp OR the journal. I 
did eventually find the container portion of the box hanging from a branch on a 
nearby tree about 25 feet from where the lid was. A search of that general area 
turned up no contents either :(</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm hoping I did the right thing in removing the 
cracked and broken box from the trail. A closer look made me suspect an animal 
MAY have done it, but I'm not too sure... Shortly before I found the box, there 
were a couple of kids on mountain bikes that quickly turned tail and headed the 
other way when the realized there was another person out there. Maybe I'm just a 
bit too suspicious...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I tried to contact the owner and left a voice-mail 
message, but haven't heard back from her yet.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, hope anyone that is going for this one gets 
this message before they leave. This is my first chance to get online and report 
this.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Take Care,</div>

                    <html><body>Vernon,  thanks so much for your efforts.  
<br/>
<br/>I took a long weekend and was away from phone and e-mail (what a joy), therefore I couldn't get back to you before this.
<br/>
<br/>I'll make a point of getting up there this week or next to check on all three boxes and bring replacement parts for Tracks 2. 
<br/>
<br/>Thanks, again, Vernon for the info as well as cleaning up for us.
