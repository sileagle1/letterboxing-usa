Thanks a lot Randy.  You just saved me a bundle!!!!  I can spend it on Rubbermaid containers now.  Still working on Delaware... may need a couple of weeks still...  Looking forward to your next PA clue set.  BTW, is that one star-rating on Lee County a typo?  I've been working on those clues for a few hours now to no avail.  How well, that's what makes your clues fun.<br/>
