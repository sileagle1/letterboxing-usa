To date, 25 stamps have been carved, fewer than half have been planted and posted, but tomorrow should see the rest in place, God willing.<br/>

  Updated 6/21/06 - WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO DO HERE BESIDES LETTERBOXING (AS IF!) - and a reminder.....this is not a scheduled-to-the-max event....RESTAURANT LISTINGS BELOW.......<br/>
<br/>
RAFTING - NOT ENOUGH SIGNUPS FOR A GROUP, SO....if you want to raft, the outfitter we had talked with is Blue Ridge Outdoor Adventures. I think that's the name on their website, too.<br/>
<br/>
Disney's ALADDIN is playing a matinee only on Saturday at the Parkway Playhouse (within walking distance of the park)<br/>
<br/>
There is a wonderful benefit concert SUNDAY AT 3 at the First Baptist Church to benefit the Lily Kraus classical music scholarship fund (that's not what it's called exactly, but somehow they get these world-famous musicians to come and play here!). Donation, I believe...<br/>
<br/>
We have a nice mom-and-pop-run movie theater here. They show first run movies, but refuse to say until the "day of" what they're going to show. But it's only $5! Such a deal. Please buy popcorn and stuff, cuz that's the only way they can stay in business! (The last family who owned it told me they had to pay the film distributor 125% of the ticket take! THAT'S why 24 cents' worth of popcorn costs $3, eh?)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, the Mudsling was last weekend - oh, well, maybe next year......<br/>
<br/>
OKAY - RESTAURANTS--------------------------<br/>
Fast Food Row: Hardee's, McDonald's, Burger King - all on "The Bypass"<br/>
Downtown:<br/>
CHINA GARDEN - Duh - Chinese - I like their moo-shu; big buffet on weekends<br/>
HILLTOP (diner-allows smokers, has outside seating, open every day; all meals). Has four - count 'em! - FOUR television sets just in case somebody tries to talk to you!<br/>
WISHBONES - more or less same as Hilltop but a little less pricey than Hilltop; no smoking, no television sets; outside seating<br/>
GARDEN DELI - sandwiches, salads, and soups and some entree stuff - 11-2 only; no smoking; outside seating (the nicest, really); closed Sunday<br/>
Elsewhere: Next to the BiLo<br/>
EL CHAPALA: guess what. Cheap. Good, if that's what you crave.<br/>
EL TOKYO: guess what. On the other side of BiLo<br/>
SUBWAY: the usual. Next to El Tokyo<br/>
INGLES SUPERMARKET: A really decent deli for takeout! Good bargain for fresher food, and some inside seating.<br/>
OOPS - Jeepsterhound and Weiner just got here - got to go plant boxes!!! More later!<br/>
<br/>
  Happy Solstice!<br/>
