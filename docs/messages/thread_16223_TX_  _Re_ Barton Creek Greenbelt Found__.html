&gt; Alrighty!  This was our first find!  Long story, but we tried last <br/>
&gt; Saturday and couldn't find it.  Of course, we ended up starting at <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; wrong trailhead and hiked about 10 miles!  But, it was fun anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, today, we tried again, starting from the correct trailhead, and <br/>
&gt; found it just as the directions stated!  We stamped in and left <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; our books containing their first stamps.  Both our 6-year-old and <br/>
our <br/>
&gt; 4-year-old loved it and the weather was great.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only note about the box, is that the logbook is basically <br/>
full.  We <br/>
&gt; were stamping the backs of pages today.  It may need to be replaced <br/>
&gt; soon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Looking forward to more finds in the coming weeks!<br/>
