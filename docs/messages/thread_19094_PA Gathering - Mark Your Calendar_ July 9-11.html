<br/>
Just a reminder, there is a gathering the weekend of July 9-11 in Bucks County, PA. For those who like to camp we are camping at Colonial Woods Campground in Upper Black Eddy, Pa from Friday night to Sunday afternoon. Go to www.colonialwoods.com to reserve a site if you would like to join us.<br/>
<br/>
For those folks who prefer not to camp we are having a gathering at the Sullivan Pavilion behind the Thompson-Neely House off of River Road in Washington Crossing, PA from about 9-3. <br/>
<br/>
Please come and meet some new friends and say hello again to some old ones. I am interested in volunteers for snack for either the Howdy Party Friday night at the campground, or the gathering under the Pavilion. Also, there is a "Pot Luck" dinner Saturday night at the campground that could use some food. If interested in participating in any way shape or form just email me off list. <br/>
<br/>
We have some folks coming down from CT and up from VA so it should be a pretty good gathering. Hope to see you there!<br/>
