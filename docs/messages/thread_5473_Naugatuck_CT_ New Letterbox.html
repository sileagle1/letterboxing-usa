<br/>
-BIKE IT OR HIKE IT-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Planted: May 22, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Length: Route 63 parking lot to Kettletown Road; 10.7 miles<br/>
<br/>
Route 63 parking lot to Letterbox; 1 mile<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Moderate. Flat hard packed surface. <br/>
<br/>
Mountain bike recommended if biking.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Take exit 17 off of I84.<br/>
<br/>
Westbound; the exit drops you onto Route 64 West. At the junction of Route 63, turn <br/>
<br/>
left onto Route 63 South. After you cross underneath the I84 underpass continue on for <br/>
<br/>
miles. Spot a brown sign on your right that says "Larkin State Bridle Trail". A small<br/>
<br/>
gravel parking lot is just off the road.<br/>
<br/>
Eastbound; At the end of the exit ramp, take a right onto Route 63 South. Travel 2.1<br/>
<br/>
miles. See directions above.<br/>
<br/>
The Larkin Bridle Trail is along a former rail bed. Built in 1881, the New York and New England Railroad ran between western Connecticut and New York. It was abandoned in 1939. In 1943, Charles Larkin gifted the rail bed to the state for use as a bridle trail. Horses, bikers and hikers now share the trail.<br/>
<br/>
The trail runs in a mostly east-west direction for 10.7 miles. Starting in the East at the Route 63 parking lot, a short trail brings you from the parking lot to bridle trail. As you head West, the trail gradually climbs to Towantic Hill, about halfway, then gradually slopes downward to Kettletown Road. The first couple of miles, the trail is a wide, smooth, hard packed surface. It then narrows and has rougher surfaces, best navigated with a mountain bike. It passes through typical Connecticut woodland and rises high above the land where fill was added for the railroad. The Western end is more open, with wetland, a powerline crossing and a nearby small airport. Please use caution at road crossings, as there are no crosswalks.<br/>
