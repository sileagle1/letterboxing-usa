I've been asked about my LbNA 100 and 500 stamps.  Specifically, I've<br/>
been asked if I mind if mailing lists be created to (presumably) be used<br/>
to route these stamps, I've been asked if I know where the stamps are, <br/>
and been asked if I mind if the idea is copied for those not likely to <br/>
get mine.<br/>
<br/>
I asked if I could respond to these questions on-list.  Normally I would<br/>
not do this (because by responding I contradict the gist of my response), <br/>
but it is nice to inject my letterboxing philosophy into the list once in <br/>
while, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
The short answers, in order are - I don't mind, I don't know, and I <br/>
don't care.  I wrote the long answer but wasn't particularily satisfied<br/>
with it.  The gist is that its role of the reader -- I, as creator of<br/>
the boxes, am long out of the picture and don't presume any influence<br/>
in the reaction to them, or orchestration of the routing of them, and<br/>
pass no judgement on the present routing mechanism or any proposed new<br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
