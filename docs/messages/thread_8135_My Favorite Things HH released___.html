Fox and I released a HH called "The Lonely Goat Herder" in August. Looks like we 
have a running theme here. Between your 2 new releases and ours we just need "Do 
a Deer" and "Sixteen Going on Seventeen" To have Sound Of Music Sound Track 
covered.</span></div>

letterboxes or letterboxing friends and adventures... ;)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we're a household of Sound of Music fans.  My Mom lived a block <br/>
from the Von Trapp family's home in Salzburg in the 1950s, and, when <br/>
we lived in Germany for many years in the 1980s, we explored all the <br/>
various haunts that were included in scenes in the movie during <br/>
several trips to Austria.  Yes, we even danced in the gazebo and <br/>
played around the crypts under the church!  What better way to <br/>
incorporate your passion for various themes with the awesome hobby <br/>
of letterboxing!!!<br/>

P.S.  Perhaps a letterbox placed near the Von Trapp family home in <br/>
Vermont is in order...too bad I live on the OPPOSITE side of the <br/>
country!  :(<br/>
