month or <br/>
&gt; two so those who participated can see what happened to the story <br/>
after they <br/>

this and <br/>
&gt; the Finger Lakes gathering at the same time.<br/>

Grrrr - the only box I missed because I had a two hour drive home to <br/>
arrive before dusk.  I'd be glad to see what's in it and perhaps <br/>
contribute a "virtual" entry with a text file and a .jpg file of my <br/>
image.<br/>

I'm so glad you came.  Really.<br/>
