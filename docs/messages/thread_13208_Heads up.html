We had a letterboxing story run in the weekend section of our paper here in <br/>
Baton Rouge.  Center story and full color photos. The story highlighted the few <br/>
boxes we have here in south Louisiana.  The web site was the only reference <br/>
mentioned so there's a good possibility for more traffic on the site and all <br/>
that goes with that.<br/>

hiking the AT near Salisbury Ct. He was taken to Sharon hosp. and <br/>
apparently needed to be airlifted to Hartford Hosp. Lets be careful <br/>

deleted the post about changing the Float your Boat gathering, because <br/>
I read over my old e-mails, and decided to just wing it. If it comes <br/>
down to it we can all camp in my backyard for all I care. The <br/>
gathering will still be Labor Day weekend at Liberty Lake. The more <br/>
people who get there on Friday the beter, so please everyone let me <br/>
know when they will be there, thanks,<br/>
