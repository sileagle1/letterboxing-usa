to oneself.  <br/>
<br/>
I went over to John Bryan Park and talked to the ranger staff... <br/>
everything is going well with the letterboxes in the park as far as <br/>
they are concerned.  <br/>
<br/>
I replaced 2 froggie boxes I knew were missing and found a third <br/>
which needed to be replaced.  It is nice to have a camper on the back <br/>
of the pick-up to sit in and carve a few stamps. <br/>
<br/>
So, the whole series of frogs is complete again, all 27.  That in <br/>
addition to the other 5 or so other boxes scattered through the park. <br/>
<br/>
Go to it! <br/>
