<br/>
I got you're message when I returned home at 9:45pm on Sunday <br/>
evening.  I<br/>
had a family gathering in The Bronx and dropped my mother off in <br/>
Bergen<br/>
County before heading home to Sussex.  I was just up by the Stone <br/>
Needle<br/>
Cross-country skiing yesterday (Sat.) and went to the very same <br/>
restaurant<br/>
for dinner.  I'll probably be joining the ski patrol there soon.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm dying to know how it went.  You're lucky you got it today.  <br/>
We're<br/>
going to be zonked with a big snowstorm starting after midnight.<br/>
<br/>
How were the clues?  Did they make sense?  Did you go on foot or rent<br/>
snowshoes?  The final landmark was pretty well covered when I was last<br/>
there.  Were my footprints still visible from the last time I checked <br/>
it?  I<br/>
walked there in a roundabout way.  Did you talk to Carol or Bernard <br/>
at the<br/>
Restaurant?  I left the set of clues with Carol on Saturday as I was<br/>
leaving.<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to hear how it went!<br/>
<br/>
John<br/>
