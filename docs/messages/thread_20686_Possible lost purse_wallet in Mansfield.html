Hi... I lost my wallet/change purse thing sometime yesterday. It may <br/>
have been dropped on the trail. It's a ittle distressing, because <br/>
while there is no money in there, there is a lot of other stuff that <br/>
I need on a daily basis.<br/>
We went to:<br/>
Team Green Dragon's  Frankenstein<br/>
Teach and Preach's Creature from the Black Lagoon<br/>
Big Guy's Cousin It (IT was dark by then and if it were to have <br/>
fallen then I wouldn't have known it)<br/>
So... if anyone is visiting these boxes and comes across a 4"X5" more <br/>
or less, change purse type thing, with my ID in it, please, please <br/>
email me. I can't offer a reward but you'll have my gratitude and I'm <br/>
sure you will get some good karma!!<br/>
