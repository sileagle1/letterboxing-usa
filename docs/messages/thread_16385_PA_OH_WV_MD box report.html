&gt; Strawberry Girl, Lone Wolf and I took advantage of their four day <br/>
weekend [...]<br/>
&gt;  But we did <br/>
&gt; end up searching for a few boxes along the way:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Erie, PA:<br/>
&gt; A Walk in the Park (two box series) - didn't find either of these, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; since good hiding places in the park seemed limited, they may no <br/>
longer be <br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't find these either back in April.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Presque Isle Lighthouse - unless someone was stamping into it <br/>
while we were <br/>
&gt; there (we did walk around a bit to check), this one is definitely <br/>
gone. We <br/>
&gt; found the lighthouse sign and the branches behind the sign that <br/>
had been <br/>
&gt; used to cover the box, but no box. Too bad, because the location <br/>
is just <br/>
&gt; wonderful. I'm so glad we visited even though we didn't find the <br/>
box. I <br/>
&gt; could've stayed all day, but we were racing the sunset and still <br/>
had one <br/>
&gt; last shot at finding an Erie box.<br/>
<br/>
Damn!  That was in my next scheduled trip!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; L-E-A-F - right where it should be, in perfect condition.<br/>
<br/>
Good!<br/>
