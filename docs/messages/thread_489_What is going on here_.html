Is that our new goal?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know much about web security.  I don't know<br/>
much about what's going on behind the scenes.  I do<br/>
know that I like having all the letterbox clues in one<br/>
place, either stored or linked there, so I can get<br/>
clues easily all over the US.  I do know that Dan's<br/>
site has been that single resource since the very<br/>
beginning of letterboxing in the US.  I really really<br/>
HATE the fact that there are already two letterboxing<br/>
groups, L-USA and ILC, and see nothing but harm coming<br/>
to the hobby if we let ourselves get further divided. <br/>
The whole reason we need to work together on the<br/>
internet is because we are so spread out, unlike our<br/>
friends in Dartmoor.  Right now, if I could move there<br/>
and do my clue postings from the comfort of the local<br/>
pub and avoid having to choose which web site to post<br/>
on, I would.  (Actually, the pub thing doesn't sound<br/>
half bad in any case... Who'll join me for a pint?)<br/>
<br/>
If the moderators care to let this pass, so much the<br/>
better.  It is, after all, about the hobby and voicing<br/>
my opinion on a subject which concerns us all.  How<br/>
can those who censor claim to support free speech at<br/>
the same time?  Is Dan being banned from his second<br/>
talk-group in as many years?<br/>

<br/>
Steve, that is all I ever wanted as well :-)  Nothing<br/>
more. <br/>
<br/>
I took the opportunity last Friday to check my VF box, <br/>
and found 7 stamp prints, and a few notes from people<br/>
telling me how much they enjoyed hunting for the box.<br/>
This weekend, I hope to check my Eastern Shore box, and<br/>
find similar notes.  That is why we are all here, <br/>
isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
I hope that somehow makes up for the trouble my clues<br/>
(and me, I guess) have seemed to cause y'all.  I never<br/>
thought hosting the clues on my server so that I could<br/>
hide a clue to a bonus letterbox would ever cause so<br/>
much grief in a million years.  It seemed like the<br/>
_letterboxing game_ thing to do.  In any case, they're<br/>
still there for more letterboxers to find, and I'm <br/>
still on track to add a few more states besides PA, <br/>
OH, MD, VA, and WV to 50Y2K -- like the proverbial <br/>
tree falling in the forest, they're still there whether <br/>
or not anyone links to them or not :-)<br/>
<br/>
In the end, this unpleasantness will be a distant memory, <br/>
just like the ILC business, but the boxes out there, my<br/>
stamp log and the memories of the hunts, such as <br/>
slogging through the New Haven river looking for <br/>
Prayer Rock, wondering if my car would make it to Mud<br/>
Pond, looking for Orca on the Knob, wandering through<br/>
Sheiling Forest, digging in the Minnesota snow, looking<br/>
for the Old Man in the Wood in Rhone Island, hiking the<br/>
AT in 4 different states hunting and hiding, etc, etc, <br/>
have survived both.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the drivel; this hobby is too strong to not<br/>
survive our attempts to destroy it :-)<br/>
