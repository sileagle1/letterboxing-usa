Whew! Scrambled to get all of your boxes, but just couldn't do it.  <br/>
Some, we had a hard time following the directions, and others were <br/>
missing.  Here's a list<br/>
MISSING:  (Oh, dear, I seem to have lost the papers, but here's a <br/>
little description:  One was by a huge military vehicle in a park <br/>
under a pine tree near the baseball field's scoreboard (No evidence <br/>
of a box).  The second that I can remember was at Kaw Lake at the <br/>
restrooms.  What was left of the box was in shreds.  We searched but <br/>
couldn't find the book nor the stamp.  I left the box there behind <br/>
the post under a rock in case you wanted to reuse it.<br/>
<br/>
The good news:  FOUND ALIVE AND WELL:<br/>

Chisolm Trail #11<br/>
Comanche<br/>
Chisolm Trail #10<br/>
Chickasaw<br/>
<br/>
Only one was missing (and you say, "ONLY one?!!):<br/>
Chisolm Trail #12- this was the one that was placed under the train <br/>
car on top of its carriage assembly.  We searched it high and low, <br/>
and unless we got the wrong train car, we're pretty sure it's gone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you happydays and lil' bucs for all of your hard <br/>
work and wonderful, creative stamps.  You're keeping my letterboxing <br/>
fire a'burnin'!<br/>

P.S.  I don't know how you do it, happydays.  I can't imagine how <br/>
many miles you've travelled just placing boxes.  How wonderful it <br/>
must be!  My favorite one of yours to hike on this trip was <br/>
Chickasaw, which was at Lake Murray.  The clue about the "reindeer" <br/>
looking back at you just tickled me to death.  It really DID look <br/>
like a reindeer!  So observant.  And it was a beautiful trail.  <br/>
