&gt; Hey! We live here! I assume you are referring to the AV.....Series. <br/>
<br/>
That's it :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; That was our 1st box since it is so very close to home. The clue is<br/>
&gt; still there on LbNA, just in the basement. <br/>
<br/>
Didn't think to look there; I rarely do.  Thanks for the reminder!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The 1st of the 3 boxes is still there, although boxes 2 and 3 seem <br/>
&gt; to have gone missing. <br/>
<br/>
That's bizarre.  I'm not surprised that #2 is gone, as it was not in a<br/>
spot that would be easy to avoid muggles seeing, but #3 was pretty off<br/>
the beaten track, I would have thought.  #1 is still there?  Have to<br/>
look the next time I go out there and see how many people actually<br/>
stamped in it.  Not an easy grab on a weekend :-o<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And there are notably few in this part of VC, although Montecito and<br/>
&gt; Summerland just a little up the 101 have quite a few.<br/>
<br/>
VC is not an easy place to hide LBs, not for those who don't want to<br/>
hike a couple of miles or more.  I won't consider hiding any in most<br/>
city parks, as I know they'll disappear.  I have plans for one in Leo<br/>
Carrillo SP, and one on the Los Robles Trail in T.O., and one above<br/>
Wheeler Gorge in Rose Valley, and on the Ray Miller Trail in Point<br/>
Mugu SP's La Jolla Canyon area.  There are other areas, too; maybe you<br/>
can find a few of them :-)  What holds me back is the carving.  I'm<br/>
not artistic at all, but I refuse to use a store-bought stamp unless<br/>
the thing *really* fits, or there is a connection that works.  Most of<br/>
the places I want to hide boxes in, no store-bought stamp is likely to<br/>
fit.<br/>
<br/>
Cheerio!<br/>
