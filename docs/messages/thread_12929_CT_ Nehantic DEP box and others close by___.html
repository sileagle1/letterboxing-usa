making it a scenic Saturday Drive through the area.... finding a <br/>
couple "mysteries" in our travels and taking the new truck into 4x4 <br/>
land through Nehantic State Forest for the DEP box there.  Silly me <br/>
wore sneakers even after B'Fly told me how Music Woman had to hop <br/>
from dry spot to dry spot to get to it... but whats a lil mud on the <br/>
sneaks???<br/>
<br/>
Found a Wooden Nickel at the DEP box, thanks Chuck and Molly! Neat <br/>
prize!!!   <br/>
<br/>
Everything that we happened upon was in great shape and dry!<br/>
<br/>
Hope the Gerbil Gathering was fun and hop you all can make it to our <br/>
gathering on 6/7.  Details soon! Plan on 12:00 noon or sometime <br/>
after that if you are coming.... with an email to me if you want to <br/>
know tentative RSVP's and times people might come!<br/>
