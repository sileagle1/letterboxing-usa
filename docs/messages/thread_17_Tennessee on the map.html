It has taken me a while to figure out where Sewanee, Tennessee is, but I<br/>
finally did it.  Becky has informed me that the letterbox linked to the<br/>
Sewanee page (Max Patch), though the clues start in Sewanee, is actually<br/>
many miles to the northeast near Max Patch Mountain by the North<br/>
Carolina border, so if you go out that way to do both boxes make sure<br/>
you plan for a day or at least a half day.<br/>
<br/>
Becky and her friends are orienteerers, so you will notice the clues get<br/>
a little more involved.  Compare her clues to the Rock Creek and Coon's<br/>
Cache clues at<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/rockcrk.htm<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, its interesting to see orienteerers invlolved (who'd've<br/>
figured..? ;-) and 4-Wheelers (OR)... and Mail artists (TX)...  and<br/>
architects (VT)...  and are Bonita (MA) and Mary Ellen (CA) teachers<br/>
also? -- along with Bob Summers (AK) and Graham Howard (UK)?<br/>
<br/>
I don't remember if I shared with you that I started out doing<br/>
navigation in the Navy coupled with data systems, then I worked as a<br/>
surveyor for 7 years: hence my interest in maps and geography and GPS<br/>
and the internet (I now program computers).  I find it fascinating that<br/>
maps are a universal medium and that they tend to not change much over<br/>
time.  So unless major roads change or your boxes reach the end of their<br/>
service-life the maps here will remain useful.  I also find it<br/>
fascinating that this hobby has invloved so many different kinds of<br/>
people from so many different age groups and walks of life.  I'm just<br/>
guessing but I think we cover from about 20 years old (Rachel? IL) to<br/>
about 60 or 70 (Graham? UK)  I'm 40.  And all the different types we<br/>
have -- Artists and the creative types to us egg-head computer types. <br/>
This is cool!  I'm happy you people are enjoying this with me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just rambling here...<br/>
Shannon, you still out there or have you Gone Gecko?<br/>
<br/>
Take care ya'll,<br/>

What a coincidence that you should be rambling and be reminded of me.  I'm<br/>
here!  I'm skimming email and trying to keep up with all the boxes going<br/>
out left and right.  I was reading your message and pondering your comments<br/>
about how letterboxing includes people of all ages from all walks of life<br/>
and holds different appeal for each of us.  It's a darn good thing, too.<br/>
I'll go anywhere for a good adventure but I'm not what you'd call a nature<br/>
girl.  A couple of years ago I asked my grandmother if I could transplant<br/>
some of the ground cover from her immaculately landscaped yard to my<br/>
pitiful barely mowed yard.  She was more than happy to oblige so I dug up a<br/>
bunch of green stuff, planted it in my flower beds, fed it, watered it,<br/>
nurtured it, and broke out in seeping blisters from head to toe as a result<br/>
of it.  I'd never seen poison ivy before, how could I know??<br/>
<br/>
I'll be binding a couple of journals next weekend for my boxes.  I don't<br/>
know for sure if I can make it but I'm trying to get to the DFW area<br/>
sometime during November 3-7.  Paper Routes is having a sale that I just<br/>
can't miss.<br/>

So nice to know you're there!<br/>
<br/>
Even nicer to find out that you have not one but 2! letterboxes in the<br/>
works.  Love to hear it!  Areyou thinking you'll put them out in a place<br/>
near you?  (Sylvia!  Sheila!  ROAD TRIP!)<br/>

Let us know when head for the Paper Routes sale!  (It does look like a good<br/>
