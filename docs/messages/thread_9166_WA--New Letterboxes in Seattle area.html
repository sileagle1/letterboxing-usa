<br/>
Planted 11/13/02<br/>
By Amanda from Seattle<br/>
<br/>
These boxes are at Des Moines Creek Park/Trail <br/>
Sea Tac, Washington.<br/>
King County <br/>
<br/>
NOTES:<br/>
This park is directly underneath the flight path for SeaTac airport. <br/>
The planes are landing or taking off every few minutes and they can <br/>
be very very loud. Being exposed to loud noises like this for any <br/>
extended period of time can DAMAGE YOUR HEARING! This is a 2 mile <br/>
hike roundtrip.  Bring earplugs (or even earmuffs or stereo <br/>
headphones will do if you don't have earplugs) to protect your ears.  <br/>
If you have small children who are frightened of loud noises, this <br/>
might not be a good hike to take them on. IT WILL BE LOUD!!<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, you get a relatively close look at the <br/>
underbellies of the planes as they takeoff and/or land.  Can you tell <br/>
the difference between the different airlines from this angle?<br/>
<br/>
You'll walk one mile on this paved path and then return. If you want <br/>
to make a "loop" out of it, you can get 3 boxes as you walk in and <br/>
the other 3 boxes as you walk out! :-) I highly recommend going all <br/>
the way to the Alaska Airlines box, it is the best stamp of the <br/>
bunch!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Driving Directions:<br/>
On International Blvd. (Hwy 99) go to S. 200th St. Head west on S. <br/>
200th St. Go approximately 1/2 mile to the bottom of the hill. <br/>
Trailhead parking is available to the left. <br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
<br/>
If you were on USAirways Flight #180 to Philadelphia, when you took <br/>
off out of Seattle, you could look down and see a Golf Course and <br/>
then a park.  You would see me (Amanda from Seattle) walking along <br/>
the paved trail until I took a right on a dirt path then an immediate <br/>
left to a big tree not the evergreen, but the deciduous one and you <br/>
would see me kneeling there behind the Big deciduous tree. Opps you <br/>
are goneTo the city of Brotherly Love.<br/>
<br/>
If you were on Delta Fight #706 to Atlanta, you would look down and <br/>
see me return to the paved trail go past a bench (Blackberries are <br/>
all along this portion of the trail  BRING a BUCKET during <br/>
Blackberry season) and past the first 1/4 mile signpost. On the right <br/>
is a clearing with a small tree cluster and a large tree cluster. In <br/>
front of the large tree cluster is a large log. You would see me <br/>
reaching under the western side of the log. Opps you are goneTo find <br/>
some Southern letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
If you were on Northwest Flight #7 to Tokyo, you would be looking <br/>
down and see me go on past a couple of sewer man-holes then taking a <br/>
right on a dirt path up a slight hill. You would see me stay to the <br/>
left when I reached an open grassy field and reentering the woods on <br/>
the SW corner of the field to a multi-trunked tree with a holly bush <br/>
beside it. You would see me carefully reaching into the southern side <br/>
of the tree between it and the holly bush.  Opps you are gonewinging <br/>
your way to the Orient.<br/>
<br/>
If you were on American Airlines Flight #1408 to Dallas, you would be <br/>
looking down at the park and see me looking over the "cliff" at the <br/>
pavement below! (DO NOT return to the paved trail this way --- <br/>
although it is evident that people have been doing just that!!) You <br/>
would see me continue around toward the left until  I could rejoin <br/>
the paved trail by taking a gradual incline down. From down here, I <br/>
can now see the Creek (and even hear it, between airplanes blasting <br/>
by overhead).  You could see me passing another 1/4 mile post and <br/>
another bench.  You can see me walk toward a huge rock that has <br/>
graffiti on it. Next to the huge rock (on the left) is a smaller rock <br/>
and some branches. You would see me reaching between these tree limbs <br/>
and the smaller rock. Opps you are gonegetting some of those new <br/>
Texas letterboxes I guess.<br/>
<br/>
If you were on United Airlines Flight #1590 to Chicago, you would <br/>
look down into the park and see me pass another 1/4 mile signpost. <br/>
You would see me come to a bridge and walk over it and up some <br/>
stairs. You would see me come to a section of fence with a tree on <br/>
the left and the right, both covered with ivy. You would see me walk <br/>
over to the tree on the right and reach around the left side of this <br/>
tree. Opps you are gone...flying the friendly skies. <br/>
<br/>
If you were on Alaska Airlines Flight #95 to Anchorage, you would <br/>
look down and see me returning over the bridge to the paved trail. <br/>
You would see me continue past another 1/4 mile post and past some <br/>
stairs on my right.  You see me stop at a large log that is close to <br/>
the path. I am reaching under the northern end of the log away from <br/>
the path. Opps you are goneenjoying that Alaska Spirit!<br/>
<br/>
Please be DISCREET and read the waiver of responsibilty and liability!<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Amanda from Seattle<br/>

<br/>
Well, Ryan, we know that YOU would not be on a flight to Tokyo <br/>
because you do not have a JOB! :-) But others of us might want to be <br/>
the first to hide letterboxes in Japan! <br/>
<br/>
I will have you know that the flights in my clues are all actual <br/>
flights that leave out of SEA every morning!!  And people on those <br/>
jets could very well have been looking out the window and would have <br/>
seen me wandering around down in the bushes planting these <br/>
letterboxes!! :-)<br/>

Ah, well, nobody would go to Zimbabwe JUST to look for my <br/>
letterboxes, but they WOULD go to see all the wonderful wildlife <br/>
and Vicortoria Falls, and any letterboxes would just be a bonus.  <br/>
=)  <br/>

The only wildlife I know about in Toyko are pink-haired wanna-be <br/>

it's not tops on my places I want to visit.<br/>

The thumb-print was as good as a stamp in this case! :p<br/>
