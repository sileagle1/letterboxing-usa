been up the clues for all 3 are not showing up.  I also noticed <br/>
nothing for Bermuda or Mexico.  The boxes do show up in "My boxes", <br/>
so must be a linking problem.   I have emailed the web master <br/>
multiple times, so not sure how else to fix this.   So, decided to <br/>
put in talk list to see if anyone else has boxes in these areas that <br/>
no one can access the clues for.  <br/>
<br/>
If going to the Virgin Islands let me know and I will send you my <br/>
clues directly until this gets fixed.<br/>

Ayup...that's been on our extensive "to do" list. Must be getting <br/>
old...you can check up on the honey-do list by clicking on the <br/>
little "changelog" icon at the bottom of the LbNA homepage (but we've <br/>
got to put "keep the changelog up to date" on the to-do list as it <br/>
may be a little out of date).<br/>
<br/>
Just for everyone's info, here are some of the stuff on that list:<br/>
-Contact the Placer button is broken<br/>
-Greening of certain counties<br/>
-Abandon the whole hand-job of greening certain counties?<br/>
-Consider and develop finder-comment fields<br/>
-"State" for hitch hikers<br/>
-"State" for virtual boxes<br/>
-Find a way for non-Wes-ters to be able to figure out people's <br/>
membership and sign-in problems<br/>
-"My Letterboxes" should return a list that includes ones where the <br/>
person is listed as Maintainer as well as Owner. <br/>
-Certain non-american areas still don't show up? <br/>
-GIS interface for an auto-mapping feature.<br/>
<br/>
As always, we are very interested in your ideas and stuff you'd like <br/>
to see on the website.<br/>
