                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found out about this crazy thing called Letterboxing while<br/>
looking for something else on the web and shared my findings<br/>
with a few close friends. We decided to go out and hunt for<br/>
a few boxes close by, see what the boxes looked like and<br/>
decide whether we wanted to make stamps of our own. I think<br/>
all three of us knew before heading out that we were hooked.<br/>
And, now, after finding 6 boxes, we definitely know that we<br/>
are.<br/>
<br/>
We didn't take any stamps along with us nor did we record<br/>
our findings in any of the log books. I guess we could have<br/>
left fingerprints but none of us wanted to bring along a<br/>
cheesy store-bought stamp so we were just out for the hunt.<br/>
As there were so many boxes in West Seattle, we started out<br/>
there. We started in Lincoln Park, as there were 5 boxes and<br/>
they were done by two different people/groups.<br/>
<br/>
We started looking for "Lincoln Park #2". We found "Clover<br/>
Box" and as Amanda reported, the stamp is split in two. We<br/>
were so excited to find that there really were boxes where<br/>
people said that there would be!<br/>
We headed onto the "Stump Box" which, after getting turned<br/>
around a few times, found that one too. Gorgeous stamp!<br/>
And then onto the "Slug Box", where we didn't find any slugs<br/>
but I'm sure there were some.  All of them were in fairly<br/>
good shape and some of them were a little damp.<br/>
<br/>
We then moved onto Lincoln Park #1. We found the "Lincoln<br/>
Park Letterbox #1". It was great to see the variety of how<br/>
the boxes are set up and stamps are different. All seemed<br/>
fairly happy in that box. The "Lincoln #2: Vashon Ferry Box"<br/>
however was pretty wet. The logbook is getting a little<br/>
moldy and some of the stamps had washed away. What should a<br/>
letterboxer do with a wet box?<br/>
<br/>
We wanted to see one more letterbox so we moved onto<br/>
"Mee-Kwa-Mooks Low Tide" for a totally different experience<br/>
outside of Lincoln Park. Beautiful log book and beautiful<br/>
stamp. All was very dry and happy in this box.<br/>
<br/>
So, needless to say, we are all very excited about<br/>
letterboxing and making our own boxes. We already have a<br/>
bunch of ideas for our own stamps and where to put some of<br/>
our own boxes. Can't wait to get going!<br/>
