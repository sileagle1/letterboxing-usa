Bug-A-Boo<br/>
<br/>
Although zillions of this little lady's cousins have worn out their <br/>
welcome around here the past couple of years, she's still one of <br/>
Ohio's beloved symbols.  We left her in a microbox (please bring a <br/>
stamp pad and pencil) tucked away where she won't bother anybody.  To <br/>
find her, look in Lake Alma State Park.  To get there, take S.R.#93 <br/>
north from Wellston and turn onto S.R. #349 just outside of town.  <br/>
S.R. #349 will lead you a couple of miles out past the water plant <br/>
and across the dam that forms Lake Alma.  (You'd never guess that 100 <br/>
years ago the island had an amusement park and interurban trains <br/>
brought people from Columbus and elsewhere to relax here!)  After you <br/>
cross the dam, the park loop road turns off to the right past the <br/>
park office and the swimming beach.  Make your way to the Pine Hill <br/>
shelter house on top of the hill.  From the east side of the drinking <br/>
fountain, take a bearing of 220 and walk 8 paces (2 steps = 1 pace) <br/>
to a very tall pine tree that forks about 5 feet from the bottom.  <br/>
