<br/>
I've been a bit under the weather and fuzzy-headed this week, so I'm<br/>
late to post this.  I just want to thank Funhog, Ryan, Amanda in<br/>
Seattle, Pat, Caitlyn &amp; Keegan for a wonderful Tuesday afternoon seeking<br/>
out the elusive Blue Lake Letterbox.  I hope that our new letterboxing<br/>
friends place some soon because their carvings are quite nice works that<br/>
I would love to have in my journal.  Why didn't I have them stamp in my<br/>
logbook with their signature stamps -- DUH!<br/>
<br/>
Also, contrary to an earlier posting, though it may sound likely, I<br/>
would never do anything harmful to Der Mad Stamper.  I rever him as one<br/>
of our fine founding fathers of this keen hobby.  However, I cannot deny<br/>
muttering a harsh word or two and his name within the same sentence, but<br/>
that is only because of sheer frustration at his puzzling clues.   Not<br/>
his fault, just my faulty brain!  As a human being he is great adored.<br/>
AND, if truth be told (I hate to admit this) other people actually LOVE<br/>
figuring out those baffling cryptograms and puzzles.  <br/>
<br/>
Those who do I've noticed are very smart people with university degrees!<br/>
(i.e. the <br/>
fine Ryan and Amanda from Seattle, who are not just gifted with smarts<br/>
but they are good-looking young people, too.  Ah, sweet youth and<br/>
beauty).  <br/>
<br/>
So...while one of us LBNA members is losing it with age (moi), others<br/>
rev their minds with this stuff.<br/>
<br/>
It was delightful getting together for this.  Ryan had a T-shirt<br/>
refering to duct tape and maybe someone can bring some along next time<br/>
they invite me to one of these ensemble hunts so I don't reveal anything<br/>
I shouldn't in the future.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was young my mom had a plaque posted on my door that evidently<br/>
still hasn't sunk in decades later.  It said:  "Be sure brain is in gear<br/>
before putting mouth in motion".<br/>
<br/>
Don't count me out folks.  I'll try to be discreet in the future and<br/>
less excited.  I had a great time.  And thanks for the ride to Gateway,<br/>
Ryan! <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

It seems you're the type of person who doesn't like people to stamp <br/>
into your logbook unless you've met them at least twice.  ;o)<br/>

We never said you WOULD do anything harmful to Der Mad Stamper.  Just <br/>
the one voted most likely to look for him in a dark, moonlit alley <br/>
to 'express' your displeasure with one of his clues.  =)<br/>
<br/>

Who?  I want references for a statement like that!  =)<br/>

<br/>
You're a kick!  I had a lot of fun on Tuesday.  Now I'm fighting this<br/>
nasty cold that is like a bad house guest that won't go away.  It's a<br/>
beautiful day for letterboxing, too.  I think we're going to get out and<br/>
at least go for a drive.  I need some fresh air and sunshine.  Lord<br/>
knows I'm not getting any better laying around the house, so  will<br/>
probably do me some good.<br/>
<br/>
You sure have a lot of F's to your credit!  Great job!  I wonder what<br/>
your next signature stamp will be?  You're a great carver.  That Taco<br/>
Bell one was awesome and the sea creatures you placed in California are<br/>
cool, too.  I hope Keegan places a box.  I loved his signature stamp.<br/>
You didn't find Doyle's Owl the other day, though?  You and Amanda got<br/>
Crystal Springs and Multnomah Falls is another Der Mad Stamper classic<br/>
that has many of us stumped.  Maybe one of these days I'll get it.<br/>
After all, it took me three times to get Mt. Tabor and I swore to God,<br/>
up and down it wasn't there.  He's very talented at placing these boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...You're not sick are you?  Get to carving and go place another<br/>
box on this beautiful day, will ya!  Thanks for everything.  It's great<br/>
to have you involved in letterboxing!  See you again, soon, I hope!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>
