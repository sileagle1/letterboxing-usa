                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, after a fun-filled evening of drying out a couple of soaking <br/>
wet log books, I have a few lessons to share with all of you boxers <br/>
out there, the first of which is a public service announcement that <br/>
cannot be said enough:<br/>
<br/>
BAG THOSE LOG BOOKS!  I know, maybe that book wasn't in a ziplock <br/>
when you found the box.  Maybe the ziplock is torn (it is just a <br/>
flimsy piece of plastic after all, &amp; most of our logs have those <br/>
really nice pieces of METAL holding them together- just perfect for <br/>
poking holes in plastic!).  Put the book in a bag &amp; seal the bag.  <br/>
Before you leave for boxing each day, throw a couple ziplocks in <br/>
your bag.  Buy them in bulk at BJ's (c'mon, you know you need 'em!) <br/>
&amp; for a couple pennies you can pack all the sandwiches you can eat <br/>
for months &amp; save a few logbooks along the way.  See a torn one, <br/>
replace it; see a bagless book, save it's life.  Pretty please with <br/>
sugar on top?  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now onto the lessons:<br/>
<br/>
1) For a VERY wet log book, a blow drying on low setting works <br/>
wonders.  If the pages are stuck together, blast the edges &amp; voila, <br/>
those suckers will pop right apart.<br/>
<br/>
2) Hold said blow dryer, about 8-10 inches from the pages to avoid <br/>
burning the paper (&amp; your hands).<br/>
<br/>
3)  Have a book or some other heavy object handy.  Eventually, those <br/>
dry, fluffy pages will start to take over (why isn't my hair ever so <br/>
light &amp; fluffy after a few seconds with the blow dryer?) &amp; get in <br/>
the way of the wet soggy pages- you'll need something to weight them <br/>
down &amp; get them out of the way (your foot works too if you're <br/>
working on the floor like I was).<br/>
<br/>
4) If the book is not QUITE as wet &amp; you can pull the pages apart <br/>
easily, try to do so &amp; stand the book up to let it air dry- with the <br/>
pages fanned out if possible... especially after your blow dryer <br/>
overheats.  They will still be damp in the morning, but they dry <br/>
nicely.<br/>
<br/>
5)  A Revlon 1875 blowdryer will overheat after approximately 1 1/2 <br/>
hours of nearly continual use.  It will restart again after waiting <br/>
approximately 45 minutes.  :)<br/>
<br/>
6)  All those pretty liquid ink pens that you might be using to <br/>
write your messages in log books- gone with the tide.  Ball points &amp; <br/>
pencils... your messages will last through the plague apparently.<br/>
<br/>
7)  Find out what type of ink Strawberry &amp; Forman are using.  Not <br/>
only did their stamps, in the soggiest portion of the book not <br/>
smudge or smear in the slightest.  It actually seemed to REPEL all <br/>
the other smudgy messes (okay, that might be an exaggeration), but <br/>
it was an oasis in a sea of washed out ink).  They use magic ink &amp; I <br/>
want to know what sort of voodoo magic they are using immediately.<br/>
<br/>
8)  Don't drink &amp; dry.  Several stamped images of compasses seemed <br/>
relatively unscathed.  I casually noticed the first one.  By the 2nd <br/>
one I was starting to think there was some sort of mystery box clue <br/>
hidden in the smudges.  (If the SOUTH side of the compass was more <br/>
heavily stamped &amp; the next page looked like a picture of a <br/>
lighthouse I should turn south at the lighthouse.  The next compass <br/>
was heavily stamped toward NORTH &amp; there was a haystack in a nearby <br/>
stamp...where can I find a lighthouse &amp; a haystack....)  Friends <br/>
don't let friends drink &amp; dry people... <br/>
<br/>
9) If you should come across a log book &amp; it is soaking wet.  PLEASE <br/>
CONTACT THE PLACER immediately.  This book has been wet for at least <br/>
a week &amp; at least 3 different sets of boxers knew about it.  Chances <br/>
are the people who knew about it are not on this list, but for those <br/>
of you who are new to the list- if you find a box that is in any way <br/>
damaged please let someone know so they can either get there <br/>
themselves to fix it or get someone else out to repair the damage.  <br/>
Keeping it to yourself helps no one.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you &amp; happy hunting!<br/>

I once found a wet log in a box in the northern part of the Florida Keys.   <br/>
The clues were in the Letterboxing basement, so hardly anyone was finding it <br/>
anymore, and I was on my way south, so I took it with me.   I stood it up as <br/>
described above, only I propped it on the a/c unit in the hotel room that night.  <br/>
 It dried out nicely and I put it back in the box on my way back north the <br/>
next day.<br/>
<br/>
Then later, I adopted the box, recarved the stamp, and reposted the clues, <br/>
but that's another story!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We use the cheap ink that is always on sale at A. C. Moore for a <br/>
dollor. Glad to know that they hold up. I have also noticed that logs <br/>
have been being left out of their bags. Last weekend we got almost 20 <br/>
boxes and most of them we found like so: ink and stamp in same bag <br/>
(the one thats not torn of course), log in the torn bag if there was <br/>
one or no bag. Is there any reasoning behind this or is common sence <br/>
not as common as we all asume? I don't see why a stamp even needs a <br/>
bag. Anyways i did my best to put the logs in bags and after i ran <br/>
out i contacted the placers.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
