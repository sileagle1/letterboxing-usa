house, but we're having a problem with one of the clues.<br/>
<br/>
She wants to do "gift to Renee" the clue mentions 2 boxes nearby placed<br/>
by the Kurdziels'. Which are the two boxes. (I want her gone all day!!!)<br/>
I thought it might be the "Dino" one, but there is no town mentioned,<br/>
just that it combines with "westwoods". "Westwoods" (if I found the new<br/>
one on the web site) is in Gilford. "Gift to Renee" is in RI. <br/>
<br/>
Please help me get rid of her. Her 62 birthday is next week.<br/>

Trish's clues to Mummies and Knights can be found on the "What's New" <br/>
page. Gift to Renee, I'm told should be there after the weekend. <br/>
Sounds like Fisherville Brook is becoming very busy. Renee will be so <br/>
excited to visit her box and see that some folks have actually <br/>
stamped in. That'll get her on the trails more often, I'm sure. <br/>
Thanks to all who have visited it so far, and to all of those who <br/>
will. I gotta get busy planting "Gift to Emily".<br/>
