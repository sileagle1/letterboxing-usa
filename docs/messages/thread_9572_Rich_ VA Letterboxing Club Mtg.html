Richmond, VA, letterboxers group that would meet periodically and <br/>
informally to do letterboxing-related activities. The first item on <br/>
the agenda would be, if okayed, to plan a series to which we all <br/>
would contribute stamps (also Ladybug's idea).<br/>
<br/>
I've contacted the Michael's store in the West End, which has a room <br/>
that we can use for free if no classes nor birthday parties are being <br/>
held in the room when we'd like it. Classes are held from 10 a.m. to <br/>
12 noon every Saturday while birthday parties, if any are scheduled, <br/>
are usually held from 12 noon to about 4 p.m. The store manager said <br/>
that if we reserve the room from 12-4, we run a chance of being <br/>
bumped if a paying birthday party asks for the room at the same time <br/>
that we have it. Presently, Michael's January calendar is wide open. <br/>
<br/>
So if you're interested in meeting your fellow boxers face to face <br/>
once in a while, let me know which of the following dates and times <br/>
in January work for you:<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, January 4, 2003, 4:30-5:30 p.m.<br/>
Saturday, January 11, 2003, 4:30-5:30 p.m.<br/>
Saturday, January 18, 2003, 4:30-5:30 p.m.<br/>
Saturday, January 25, 2003, 4:30-5:30 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't want to touch Sundays in January because of possible <br/>
religious conflicts. I was also reluctant to suggest weekday evenings <br/>
because of work/family conflicts. But if times other than the ones <br/>
above work for you, let me know that as well. Any suggestions and all <br/>
input are welcome!<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know what times work for you by Friday, December 14 so <br/>
that I can get on Michael's calendar and before we all get utterly <br/>
immersed in holiday prep. You can e-mail me at mlgainey@yahoo.com.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, Season's Greetings and hope to see you on the <br/>
trails (and at Michael's in January!).<br/>
