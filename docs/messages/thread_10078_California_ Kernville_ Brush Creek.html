<div>California, Kernville , Brush Creek , by Don &amp; 
Gwen , 1-6-03</div>
<div>     During the summer of 2002 the Mc Nally fire 
devastated over 250,000 acres of the Sequoia Forest , threatened the Giant 
Sequoias , burned down Roads End Inn , and left a scar in the wilderness. This 
box is located in the southern edge of the fire zone. Small patches of forest 
remain and new growth can be found. From Kernville drive north along the Kern 
River to the large Brush Creek parking area on your left just past the 
Limestone campground. If you cross over the Johnsondale bridge turn around , you 
have gone too far.<span id="__#Ath#SignaturePos__"></span> From the parking 
area take the trail along Brush Creek and pass by a two poled brown sign on your 
left. Approximately 200 paces past the two poled sign take a faint trail up 
to your left. Approximately 75 paces up this trail , you will be higher than the 
creek , look across the creek for a large , truck sized , rounded rectangular 
boulder. When this boulder is at 150 degrees stop, look up hill at 56 degrees 
for a rock outcropping that has orange lichen on it.The orange lichen looks like 
it has been dabbed across the face of the rock outcropping.  Go up hill 
approximately 20 paces and look in the crevice in front of the lichen. The box 
is covered in movable rocks approximately 4 ft. high.</div></body></html>
