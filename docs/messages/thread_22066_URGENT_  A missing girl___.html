called the Bedlam Bards.<br/>
<br/>
As of a few days ago one of the singers has come up missing.  She is a<br/>
very talented girl but everyone is quite worried as she has not picked<br/>
up her last paycheck at her job and a credit card that her father gave<br/>
her in Ark. Was last used in TN.<br/>
<br/>
If you are out boxing this weekend PLEASE keep an eye out for this girl<br/>
and call if you happen to see her.<br/>
<br/>
Pictures can be seen at this link:<br/>

<br/>
Pics of her in her regular clothes are:<br/>

<br/>
She has lost some weight since these pictures.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the story:<br/>
<br/>
Pat'n Mcrack (Pat Odel) has requested I put this out on as many <br/>
groups as possible.<br/>
If you see this please forward it to any groups you are a part of.<br/>
<br/>
His daughter Lilly is missing.  She is 23, petite dark hair. <br/>
She was staying at her fathers in Arkansas taking care of his <br/>
livestock and had a job.<br/>
She has not picked up her last paycheck.  She was in the company of <br/>
her "boyfriend"<br/>
Christopher (Chris) Ballard, he is 27 and has jail time.<br/>
<br/>
When Pat left Arkansas they were on their way to a friend's house to <br/>
do laundry.  They have not been seen since.  Everything she owns, <br/>
except for her guitar and a photo of her<br/>
and Chris is in Arkansas.  Pat left a credit card with her and it <br/>
was last used in Knoxville TN.<br/>
<br/>
Pat has filed a missing person report with the police and they are <br/>
following all the leads<br/>
they have. <br/>
<br/>
This is totally out of character for Lilly and Pat is very worried.  <br/>
She has been trying to contact a friend named James that was with <br/>
one of the fire shows at Hawkwood.  Pat has been in contact with his <br/>
Grandmother.  She last tired to contact him on May 24th and 25th.<br/>
There has been no word since.<br/>
<br/>
Pat would like for feelers to be put out everywhere we can reach. He <br/>
wants to hear from Lilly in case she needs help or to know she is <br/>
ok.  Just a phone call would help tremendously.<br/>
<br/>
If you have heard from her or know anything about her whereabouts <br/>
please contact Pat.<br/>
He is in Arkansas now, his land line is 501-745-6891 and his cell is <br/>
713-516-6935.<br/>
<br/>
Please help locate Lilly.<br/>
