                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all. This is just a friendly invite to one and all to our 2nd <br/>
Ontario gathering - the first was in Kingston last year. <br/>
<br/>
Date is 29 Sep 07 from 0930 to 5 ish. at Victoria park in downtown <br/>
Belleville, ON. Info is posted on AQ or you can drop me a line. This <br/>
promises to be a nice, intimate gathering with 25 to 30 folks <br/>
expected. <br/>
<br/>
Our theme is Box "ON!" which is a play on the abbreviation for <br/>
Ontario. As such, I have special Ontario regional boxes graciously <br/>
created by members of the Ontario boxing community.<br/>
<br/>
I now have 5 of the 7 regional boxes, receiving Gwynlais' <br/>
contribution today (boy are you guys in for a treat!!) with only 2 <br/>
to come.<br/>
<br/>
Also, rumour has it the "circus" will be in town that day as <br/>
well...folks, you DO NOT want to miss that!<br/>
<br/>
Numbers still appear to be in the 25 to 30 range, still very <br/>
comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
I will be posting directions to Victoria Park on the events page on <br/>
AQ very shortly.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any questions or concerns, pls drop me a line or post <br/>
a comment.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Jiggs<br/>
