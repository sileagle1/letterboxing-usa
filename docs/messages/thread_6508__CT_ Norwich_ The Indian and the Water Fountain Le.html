                    <html><body>Just an FYI, we (and numerous other letterboxers over the last two months, according to the entries in box #3) believe that the Indian letterbox #2 is missing.  
<br/>
<br/>Also, the other three boxes (1,3,4) need new logbooks.  Darrin and I would have done it if we have had some logbooks with us.  They have been full for quite some time and some people are doubling up on the pages.  It is quite confusing to find who was there before you and when.  If anyone knows who "owns" these letterboxes, please forward this message.  If there is no owner, perhaps Darrin and I can go down and tend to them sometime soon.
<br/>
<br/>Thanks!
<br/>Pam and Darrin</body></html>
