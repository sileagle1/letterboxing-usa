Texas History Letterbox Series<br/>
<br/>
The "Battleship Texas" letterbox is located in San Jacinto <br/>
Battleground State Historical Park, near the Battleship Texas.  The <br/>
Battleship Texas (BB-35) was commissioned in 1914, and was the most <br/>
powerful weapon in the world.  She is the last of the "Dreadnoughts", <br/>
and the only surviving U.S. naval vessel to serve in both World <br/>
Wars.  Take a tour of the USS Texas, and enjoy the rest of the <br/>
Battlefield (including finding Silver Eagle's box).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
Located just East of Houston, take Hwy 225 from the I-610 loop going <br/>
east for about 8 miles to Deer Park.  Turn left (north) on Hwy 143, <br/>
following the San Jacinto Battleground signs.  Continue on Hwy 143 to <br/>
the Battleship Texas area on your left (you will see the San Jac <br/>
monument on your right).  Turn in left, and follow the signs to the <br/>
Battleship (Be sure to notice large propeller on your right as you <br/>
head for parking lot).  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead and tour the Battleship.  Once done, walk around the <br/>
battlefield, ending up at the propeller mentioned earlier.  From the <br/>
Northeast corner of the gate around the propeller, go 45 paces at 30 <br/>
degrees to the end of the white rail fence.  Cross between this fence <br/>
and an orange "Warning" sign, getting on the east side of the <br/>
hedgerow.  From the end of the hedge at the sign, go 15 paces along <br/>
it to a tree at its side.  The box is at the base of this tree, on <br/>
the far north side, covered in leaves and a limb on top.  Please re-<br/>
hide well!!<br/>
