&gt; Looks like there is a good bit of interest in the medallions.  I <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; some info from The Hermann Werks, Inc.  www.thewerks.com<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The minimum order is 12.  Prices will vary depending on how many we <br/>
&gt; order.  They also charge a fee if the art needs to be redrawn.  I <br/>
&gt; anticipate the cost can be kept low, just a few dollars including <br/>
&gt; shipping.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The medallions are either engraved or full color images sublimated <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; aluminum.  I will try to scan some of the samples they sent.  I <br/>
also <br/>
&gt; will need to check on their current prices.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Keep your eyes on the list this weekend as that is likely when I <br/>
will <br/>
&gt; put up the exact info.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would have prefered the relief type that you can get from <br/>
&gt; www.hikeamerica.com but these seem nice also.<br/>
