Saturday, January 24th<br/>
10:30 am - whenever (at least 2:00pm)<br/>
Place: VA in the Food Court at the new National Air &amp; Space Museum <br/>
annex officially known as the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles <br/>

What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
The date is tricky of course.  More people voted in favor of 1/31 but <br/>
two people vetoed that date a no other date was vetoed.  So 1/24 or <br/>
2/7 were runners up.  I chose Jan. for it's dead of winterishness.<br/>

Well darn, I was really hoping for Greenbelt since Dulles is a LOONG drive away.  (But <br/>
as a lurker, I figured I probably shouldn't vote.)  Anyway, I'll try and be there and meet <br/>
all of you who I've emailed about finding your boxes, even if I'm darned quiet the rest <br/>
of the time.<br/>
<br/>
So where in the heck IS this annex?  Dulles is at least an hour and a half away, so I <br/>
really have no idea where/how to get over there for anything.<br/>
<br/>

Holy Moley!  That's really far away.  Hopefully, I'll manage to visit anyway.  So what <br/>
happens at one of these shindigs?  Do we all go boxing en masse?  Do we sit around <br/>
in a coffeeshop and say hi to each other and chat?<br/>
