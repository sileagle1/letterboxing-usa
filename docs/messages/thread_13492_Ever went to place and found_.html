The Squirrel Girls were out hiding our Greenbriar series.    We all spotted <br/>
the same tree stump and said "that looks like a great place to hide a box."  <br/>
When I climbed up the hill to the stump - it was already occupied by a geocache. <br/>
 I guess it really was a good place to hide a box!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last Friday I took a hike in Ashby, MA to a place called Blood Hill.  <br/>
I went to take a picture of the wisteria growing in front of an old <br/>
barn as well as for the hike.  I had in mind to plant a box but was <br/>
out of notebooks.  I didn't want to go out of my way to shop but I <br/>
grabbed my carving tool and rubber stamp material anyway.  After <br/>
taking pictures at the bottom of the hill, I hiked to the top and <br/>
found a large square metal box sitting in plain view on a stone <br/>
wall.  At first I thought it was a geocache box, but when I opened it <br/>
there was a journal and several colored pencils and markers.  The <br/>
journal was left for visitors to just jot down their thoughts, <br/>
inspirations or maybe draw a picture.  Of course I had to sign my own <br/>
entry with my personal stamp adding a note about letterboxing.org for <br/>
anyone interested.  Then I sat and carved a rough image of the <br/>
wisteria and barn and bagged it in the box with a colored marker.  It <br/>
was my first 'on site' carving - I was thrilled to have a chance to <br/>
introduce unsuspecting hikers to the joys of letterboxing.<br/>
