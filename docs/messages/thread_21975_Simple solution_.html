<br/>
And how would such a system be enforced?<br/>
<br/>
Seems like the element of "reality" is missing from this scenario.<br/>
People are going to place boxes if they want to regardless of how many<br/>
they've already found or an on-line quiz on letterboxing best practices.<br/>
<br/>
Not saying it's a bad idea, but it is. ;o) At least in the sense of<br/>
enforcement goes.<br/>
<br/>
And just so nobody else has to take a bullet on the issue, there's<br/>
probably a number of people who will point out that there aren't five<br/>
letterboxes within a hundred miles of where they live and if they had<br/>
to wait until they found five before they could plant a box, they'd<br/>
have to wait YEARS! So those people probably won't support such an<br/>
idea either.<br/>
<br/>
For those newbies out there, though, I'd definitely recommend finding<br/>
as many as you can before you start planting boxes of your own. You'll<br/>
learn the difference between a good and bad hiding place and when you<br/>
are ready to plant a box, it'll be that much better. Learn from other<br/>
people--find boxes before you start planting them.<br/>
<br/>
Enforcing such a rule would be a tough go, however.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
The placement of boxes is a very good point.  And, it's a dilemma in<br/>
some locations as well.<br/>
<br/>
For example, one of my letterboxes--now missing--was in a New England<br/>
stone wall.  The choices were:  Do I hide it well in the wall and risk<br/>
over-enthusiastic people dismantling part of the wall; or, do I place<br/>
the box where it could be seen by a child of the right height, just<br/>
looking into the wall?  In that particular setting--a wonderful old NH<br/>
cemetery--the wall was my only possible hiding place if I wanted<br/>
people to visit the cemetery to enjoy its history.<br/>
<br/>
I chose the latter--not very concealed--and I was more surprised at<br/>
how long the box survived rather than how quickly it was "lost."<br/>
<br/>
Today, I live in Texas, where some locations present different<br/>
challenges: Spiders and snakes in hidden natural crevices that--in New<br/>
England--I'd consider "just waiting for a letterbox."<br/>
<br/>
I generally study clues for hints about how well a box has been<br/>
placed.  A box that is described as "on top of" a boulder, or some<br/>
other natural landmark... there's less than a 50/50 chance that it's<br/>
still there.  Likewise, if I get to the site and the clues are clearly<br/>
by a newbie, I know that my search may be fruitless.<br/>
<br/>
But, I have to add this:  I letterbox for a variety of reasons, only<br/>
one of which is finding the box and adding to my numbers.  At least<br/>
half of why I do this--and probably more like 80%--is the adventure<br/>
and the absolute joy of exploring new trails, seeing new sights, and<br/>
so on.  My photos from letterboxing hikes are probably more valuable<br/>
to me than the stamps in my own logbook.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I know that many people are very goal-driven, so a missing<br/>
letterbox is far more significant disappointing for them than it is<br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
Here is one suggestion for those who feel that experienced<br/>
letterboxers are more likely to plant reliable, well-hidden boxes with<br/>
good clues:  On your clue pages, post your numbers found, planted, and<br/>
so on.  You can update this with one click, with a simple JavaScript<br/>
code that's entered on each clue page as you create it.<br/>
<br/>
The liability there is, of course, boxes that you planted earlier are<br/>
probably less reliable than your later boxes, but if you note when the<br/>
box was planted, readers can make an informed guess about the<br/>
likelihood of the box still being there.<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">One of LB greateast attributes is that there's no hard rules to go <br/>
by.  Trying to place regulations is futile and takes away from it's <br/>
charm.  If there is a big issue of newbies improperly hiding LBs, <br/>
then maybe we should emphasis proper hiding technique anytime a new <br/>
person posts a question.<br/>
<br/>
The issue I have more concern about is Improper Re-Hideation, so <br/>
much so I made a LB to raise local awareness.  Unfortunatly it <br/>
hasn't seemed to help.  I recently found my Rock Bridge missing.  I <br/>
took a calculated risk in it's location, a high traffic area.  But <br/>
it was a great hiding spot and one that would remain unfound unless <br/>
you had the clues or it was improperly re-hidden.  So I'll replace <br/>
it.  Maybe in the same spot, maybe not.  A cool hiding spot, to me, <br/>
is a lot of the fun.    <br/>
<br/>
I see LB as placing a bit of joy out into the world, with no <br/>
expectations.  You just throw it out for others to enjoy.  Maybe <br/>
lots of folks will find it and maybe no one will.  That's what I <br/>
find so neat about it (among other things).  Maybe your box will be <br/>
kidnapped by the FF.  We just never know.  Placing a box we all know <br/>
the risks.  We do our best, but the possibility always exsists that <br/>
someone won't re-hide it properly and someone will take it.  <br/>
<br/>
Remember; only you can prevent Improper Re-Hideation!   <br/>

Hmmm...I have (I mean had) a four box series that had survived a <br/>
couple of years--until recently when somebody (I'm assuming it was a <br/>
person) found the boxes and removed all of the stamps.  Not sure an <br/>
animal can remove stamps from 35mm film canisters yet leave the <br/>
logbooks intact.  These boxes were hidden in 'alternative manners' <br/>
so having the clues in hand was practically required to find the <br/>
boxes.  Just an example.  It's funny, the unlisted boxes <br/>
(clues not posted to the net--distro'd WOM) seem to fare much better <br/>
over the long run.  Maybe the animals don't have computers?  I'm <br/>
just kidding here.  Seriously, missing boxes is part of this hobby.  <br/>
We know that.  We're used to onesies/twosies going missing all the <br/>
time--it's the nature of the hobby.  It's just when lots of boxes go <br/>
missing in a short spurt of time and they're all located in a small <br/>
radius of a region--it triggers some sort of alarm.  Then, the <br/>
reason they went missing is likely not due to accidental discovery <br/>
but rather a more mischievous or sinister intent.  For time, effort, <br/>
and resources (I now pay $2.54/gallon of gas and have limited free <br/>
time) that go into planting boxes it is VERY frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
I've had a couple of 'clusters' of boxes go missing over the years.  <br/>
One cluster involved about 15 boxes over the course of 3 weeks and <br/>
all within a 5 mile radius of eachother.  Once I noticed they'd gone <br/>
missing (in piecemeal fashion nonetheless), I pulled the links to <br/>
all of the clues from that region and the boxes that were still <br/>
intact survived much longer.  The ones that disappeared during <br/>
the 'cluster attack' were either retired or replanted in totally <br/>
different spots.<br/>
<br/>
The point is this--folks who plant boxes put a lot of time and <br/>
effort into the process.  Sometimes it doesn't seem to be all <br/>
that 'appreciated' when visitors fail to re-hide the boxes very well <br/>
or send 'rude' comments about the clues being too difficult (yes, <br/>
I've received a bunch of these 'odd' comments, too).  Not all clues <br/>
are designed for elementary students.  I've found boxes of ours that <br/>
weren't even 'closed' at all after visitors stamped in, ziploc bags <br/>
not even zipped (in the NW it's imperative they get closed or the <br/>
logbook is toast) and a couple of boxes completely left out in the <br/>
open (one we found at about 10:00am just a few hours after another <br/>
group of visitors had stamped in--it was completely on the ground, <br/>
no attempt to rehide it whatsoever--and its hiding spot was on a <br/>
cross beam under an observation deck adjacent a lake--the box was on <br/>
the ground in full view of folks standing on the observation deck <br/>
above).  These are just 'concrete' examples of things we've <br/>
experienced over the years--so my answers aren't 'generalizations' <br/>
that get short shrifted just because they appear to have 'jumped on <br/>
the bandwagon'.<br/>
<br/>
Preaching to the choir here I know but folks need to take care in <br/>
rehiding boxes after they visit, camouflage them well and let the <br/>
planters know how the boxes are doing so they can keep up with the <br/>
maintenance--that can get rather cumbersome with lots of boxes out <br/>
in the world.  I'm convinced that every letterboxer should plant at <br/>
least one box in the world, so they appreciate what goes into the <br/>
process. Perhaps that should be an 'initiation' rite once the scars <br/>
heal from carving that first signature stamp?  ;)<br/>

Excellent suggestion! A rite of passage - an initiation. Very good idea.<br/>
Kind of like raising children - you don't appreciate all the work involved until you have your own!<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Simple solution?<br/>
<br/>
    I think a great deal of the "clutter" problem could be solved if we<br/>
required people to document that they had found at least five boxes BEFORE<br/>
they were allowed to place one of their own.  Better yet, also require a<br/>
brief on-line quiz on letterboxing best practices.<br/>
    Neither would slow the pace of the hobby, but both would help the stolen<br/>
box problem.<br/>

I think it's obvious to most of us that some people post here for no other reason than to start arguements, be mean, and otherwise get their jollies off while they sit behind the keyboard hitting send. They seem to get more enjoyment out of that than they do letterboxing. <br/>
missmoon<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can understand frustration, but why dwell on it until it becomes anger?  Unless you <br/>
actually witness new/careless boxers/vandals ruining letterboxes, why jump to <br/>
conclusions?  Whether you consider letterboxing a competitive sport or hobby, can we <br/>
agree that it is definitely a past-time?  Something you do for enjoyment?  If this activity <br/>
brings you frustration, pain and anger, why do you continue?  What is your payoff?  Do you <br/>
like to post unkind messages and bait others?  Do enjoy getting others angry too?<br/>

As one of those people who enjoys these flames because, lets face it,<br/>
it's fun to watch people behaving, well, like people. If you sit back<br/>
and observe without getting emotionally involved it's actually quite<br/>
funny at times. I don't think anyone posts to be mean but I think<br/>
everyone needs to work on being a little less sensative and slow down<br/>

it's the knee jerk reactions that are the most fun.<br/>

Ladies, Ladies, Please. We're all choking on the flying fur here. <br/>
<br/>
As one of those people who enjoys these flames because, lets face it,<br/>
it's fun to watch people behaving, well, like people. If you sit back<br/>
and observe without getting emotionally involved it's actually quite<br/>
funny at times. I don't think anyone posts to be mean but I think<br/>
everyone needs to work on being a little less sensative and slow down<br/>
on the knee jerk reactions. However (looking both ways and whispering)<br/>
it's the knee jerk reactions that are the most fun.<br/>
<br/>
I think the solution is to welcome the newbies with open arms, and<br/>
then use the extended apendage to slap some sense into them<br/>
(figuratively speaking of course....)<br/>

                        From: <strong>SpringChick (springchick@letterbox-mi.com)</strong> |

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In theory perhaps a simple solution.  But not necessarily realistic <br/>
or even effective.<br/>
<br/>
Had there been such a "5-box" rule when I began letterboxing, I <br/>
would probably have not gotten involved in the hobby.  There were <br/>
not 5 boxes within 3 hours of me.  So instead, I placed boxes, many <br/>
boxes, after having only found 2 boxes.  I read every letterboxing <br/>
FAQ and every web site I could find.  I e-mailed people on the list <br/>
with questions -- probably to the point of annoying some, but most <br/>
were extremely helpful.  And I planted letterboxes not knowing who <br/>
or if anyone was even going to come looking for them.  To those who <br/>
live in areas where letterboxes are plentiful and distances from <br/>
state to state are short, such a rule may seem a logical solution, <br/>
but I would bet my situation is not unique and the spread of <br/>
letterboxes to areas where there once were none has been in large, <br/>
done by people who have found few boxes and plant because that is <br/>
the only way you can play the game when there are no boxes near you.<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong, I am not against some sort of a "pass the bar" <br/>
thing in this game.  I like the system they have in the UK where you <br/>
can't get the clues without proving that you are a player.  But <br/>
rather than restrict people from planting, I would rather see <br/>
restriction of clues -- and availability based on a combined number <br/>
of plants &amp; finds (thus making clues attainable to people who <br/>
primarily find and to those who primarily plant).  I like the <br/>
AtlasQuest "premium members only" clue premise, but there are so few <br/>
premium members in my area, if I restricted my clues in this way, <br/>
who would ever find them?<br/>
<br/>
On another note...  I do not disagree that newbies are guilty of not <br/>
rehiding boxes well, of not being discreet, etc.  But I cannot tell <br/>
you how many times I have come upon a letterbox that was in plain <br/>
view or not re-packaged well and the last finder was not a newbie, <br/>
rather folks who have been around for a while.  There is always the <br/>
possibility that animals or non-letterboxers are the ones <br/>
responsible for a poorly hidden box.<br/>
<br/>
I am a firm believer that one of the best ways to safeguard your <br/>
boxes from disappearing is to choose good hiding places and to make <br/>
the clues more difficult than the all-too-common, "Take trail X, <br/>
turn at the 20-armed oak and look in the hollow log," not to mention <br/>
the options for making clues harder to get to in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot control other people, their level of respect (or lack of <br/>

if we<br/>

require a<br/>

&gt;     Neither would slow the pace of the hobby, but both would help <br/>
the stolen<br/>

<br/>
I agree that more challenging clues are a good idea if you want a<br/>
letterbox to survive longer.  That also needs to be balanced against<br/>
the likelihood that--in some locations--animals will get into the box.<br/>
 Sometimes, curious raccoons just love to carry boxes off a few feet<br/>
and open them (or try to).<br/>
<br/>
I've planted some very easy-to-find boxes, and they survived longer<br/>
than I expected.  But, when I do plant an easy one--sometimes, I've<br/>
even put photos online to guide people along the path--I do this with<br/>
the full expectation that the box will be gone in weeks, and perhaps<br/>
days.  Those are usually the boxes that aren't as elegant as my<br/>
others, and I won't sob inconsolably if/when they vanish.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that I'm committed to creating some boxes that are very easy<br/>
for beginners, as well as tougher challenges for letterboxers with<br/>
more experience.<br/>
<br/>
But, I'm also someone who does this for fun, and enjoys the challenges<br/>
as well as the hikes, almost as much as the thrill of finding a<br/>
letterbox.<br/>

The clue is the choice we make when we want to check out letterboxes.<br/>
