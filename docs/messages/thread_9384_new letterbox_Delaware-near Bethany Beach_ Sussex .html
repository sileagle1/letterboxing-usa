Planted 11-26-02 by Cherieph and BBBunny<br/>
<br/>
This lighthouse was built in 1858 and originally burned whale oil. <br/>
It is now electric, owned by the state of Deleware and maintained by<br/>
a private organization.  It does have a visitors center and is<br/>
located off Rt 54 in Fenwick Island,Delaware.  I didn't plant the box <br/>
there because it is a small lighthouse and in the middle of houses.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you can find the Assowoman WMA near Bethany Beach you can find <br/>
2 other boxes, enjoy the drive-thru nature information and then find <br/>
this box.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Find the WMA-and that's the hard part of this box!  When <br/>
you reach the Observation Tower and find that box, continue down the <br/>
road to Mulberry landing.  Park and walk over to the dock.  Facing<br/>
the orange life vest sign and taking a reading of 170 degrees you can <br/>
see the Fenwick Island Lighthouse in the distance.  But this is not <br/>
where the box is.  <br/>
Turn around and head back toward the duck blind past the edge of the <br/>
pond, just about opposite from where you are standing.  From the<br/>
first big oak on the trail leading to the duck blind take a reading<br/>
of 340 degrees.  The 2nd, larger, tree does not have your prize<br/>
inside (and it is a great hiding hole, just too deep) but it is <br/>
nestled on the SW side of the trunk.  <br/>
Be careful when stamping in; you are visible from the parking lot and <br/>
the trail.<br/>
<br/>
I learned that the DS signs are for Deer Stands and are available for <br/>
hiking-and planting more boxes?<br/>
any box problems email cherieph@aol.com  We get down here about 4 <br/>
times a year so I can fix them, but it may be a while...<br/>
