creators. They like to walk into a dark room, yell "Fire"  while <br/>
handing the burning match to the person standing next to them.  Just <br/>

Everyone here is answering in very polite ways and not taking the <br/>
bait to start a fight.  I (as a newbie) am happy to see that. :) I <br/>
have been a part of too many online egroups that will take the bait <br/>
and allow this outsider's behaviour to cause dissention. <br/>
