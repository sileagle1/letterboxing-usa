Dear Wanda,<br/>
<br/>
Everybody has the right to be new. Some of the fun of this craft is <br/>
improving in skill, as well as the art. Whatever it looks like now, <br/>
make the next one better. Keep on trying. You are doing stuff that <br/>
very few folks ever attempt.<br/>
<br/>
Correct tools is vital for this. Honestly, you skimp on tools at the <br/>
risk of getting discouraged and quitting.<br/>
<br/>
The Speedball carving set with about four gouges in it is fine. I do <br/>
not know how other folks do it with Xacto Blades but the gouges are <br/>
meant for the kind of work we do. <br/>
<br/>
I recently bought a Two Cherries 0.5 mm gouge. It is immensely <br/>
satisfying to use. The tip is only a third as wide as the smallest <br/>
Speedball one. It is pricey, however; I spent about $32 on the one <br/>
gouge. <br/>
<br/>
The best carving material is, by far, the Master Carve (has a logo <br/>
that says "carves like butter".) I like the thick stuff for personal <br/>
stamps and the thinner for boxes. <br/>
<br/>
Sir Speedycut to me is too crumbly and both resists and then gives <br/>
unexpectedly. Not good. There is some thin pink stuff that works well <br/>
enough, especially for microboxes. But you can carve Pink Pearl <br/>
erasers and get something fairly okay, right? <br/>
<br/>
Again, it is good to be a little dissatisfied with anything you do in <br/>
art. Let other folks believe you meant it that way: rough. Remember <br/>
that we do not really want to have store bought stamps or stamps that <br/>
look like they are store bought. <br/>
<br/>
You might as JugglerMouse for tips on carving, BTW. She is the best <br/>
we have around here.<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully submitted,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, that was me. However, I have been reading online nearly non-<br/>
stop - or at least every free minute, since finding this group, LbNA <br/>
and a Webring on the subject of 'all things letterboxing', since I <br/>
first read the article in Family Fun this past Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
So what I DID go after at Hobby Lobby, and what I came home with <br/>
were these items.... A Speedball Speedy-Stamp Stamp Making Kit: <br/>
4"x6" Speedy Stamp block, wooden handle, No.2 V-shaped line cutter, <br/>
No.4 U-shaped gouge, tracing paper and a leaflet with 5 images, and <br/>
I also got an extra Carving Block: Staedtler Mastercarve "Cuts Like <br/>
Butter".  However, I figured the five images provided were much too <br/>
common for signatures with beginning letterboxers, so tried to carve <br/>
something different - a comical cartoonish bee, in a frame. However, <br/>
she looks seriously inebriated! But, I could live with her... Then <br/>
this evening I tried to carve a stamp for my first (to be) planted <br/>
letterbox. I wanted it to fit the theme of the place I have <br/>
selected. Having learned from carving the bee, to be more careful, I <br/>
looked for some appropriate gifs on the internet, rather than <br/>
drawing my own image. So I found an image, transfered it, reversed <br/>
it to use as a mirror image on the other end of the stamp, and wrote <br/>
wording between/above the two figures. Transfered it all, and <br/>
started carving... This one was even worse than my signature stamp! <br/>
Actually, I think I just chose the wrong gif to use, AND got started <br/>
out on the wrong foot this time.... BUT... I will keep at it and <br/>
practice, practice, practice. I hate to use the 'plain and simple' <br/>
examples from the brochure, since I am sure there are hundreds of <br/>
those out there from previous newbies, but I may have to, to get a <br/>
decent image. <br/>
<br/>
 Thank you so much, Cadenza, for taking the time to try to help <br/>
me!      <br/>

Oh, please don't feel like an outsider in a group of experts, Wanda!  I, for one, have been boxing for about 3 yrs. and have only carved two stamps, and neither is all that pretty!  :-)  Some of us really could not care less for the artisitic end of the passtime, and buy stamps.  Or we just don't want to devote the time and energy to carving. To some, the clue-making, the solving, or the just-getting-out-there is what it's all about.  If you want to perfect your carving, go for it!  I've seen some awesome carved stamps, and others I just can't even discern what the picture is supposed to be. :::sigh:::  Other times, a store-bought stamp is just the right one for a particular box.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, have fun with whatever it is about l'boxing that floats your boat (or moves your hiking shoes).  <br/>
<br/>

&gt; meant for the kind of work we do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I recently bought a Two Cherries 0.5 mm gouge. It is immensely<br/>
&gt; satisfying to use. The tip is only a third as wide as the smallest<br/>
&gt; Speedball one. It is pricey, however; I spent about $32 on the one<br/>
&gt; gouge. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The best carving material is, by far, the Master Carve (has a logo<br/>
&gt; that says "carves like butter".) I like the thick stuff for<br/>
personal <br/>
&gt; stamps and the thinner for boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sir Speedycut to me is too crumbly and both resists and then gives<br/>
&gt; unexpectedly. Not good. There is some thin pink stuff that works<br/>
well <br/>
&gt; enough, especially for microboxes. But you can carve Pink Pearl<br/>
&gt; erasers and get something fairly okay, right?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Again, it is good to be a little dissatisfied with anything you do<br/>
in <br/>
&gt; art. Let other folks believe you meant it that way: rough.<br/>
Remember <br/>
&gt; that we do not really want to have store bought stamps or stamps<br/>
that <br/>
&gt; look like they are store bought.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You might as JugglerMouse for tips on carving, BTW. She is the<br/>
best <br/>
&gt; we have around here.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Cadenza. :) Since you have only been carving for about 4 <br/>
months, you know what I am talking about! After neatening up my <br/>
latest stamp, I am going to go ahead and use it, in the box I hope <br/>
to plant this week. Even though it did not turn out like I wanted <br/>
it, it does have decent lettering. At least that's one good thing. <br/>
<br/>
No, you don't feel closed. I was just frustrated with the carving <br/>
not going well.<br/>

Personally, I<br/>

little<br/>

of my<br/>

&gt; Dear Sir Balthazar,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  THANK YOU SO MUCH for your kindness! Your words, "Everybody has<br/>
&gt; the right to be new." really touched me! I was beginning to feel a<br/>
&gt; little like a untalented hanger-on, in a semi-closed group of<br/>
&gt; experts. ;)<br/>
&gt; I think it's either going to take a lot more practice, or else the<br/>
&gt; luck of finding someone nearby who makes stamps and be able<br/>
&gt; to 'carve with them' awhile - or BOTH!<br/>
&gt; I was wishing that it was more like the CT area, here... SO many<br/>
&gt; letterboxes all over the place, and so many letterboxers. That does<br/>
&gt; sound wonderful. But with the setback of my carving <br/>
dissatisfaction,<br/>
&gt; it will take me awhile to be able to plant many boxes anyway... I<br/>
&gt; will have plenty to keep me busy!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks again for your help and wisdom.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Everybody has the right to be new. Some of the fun of this craft<br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; improving in skill, as well as the art. Whatever it looks like<br/>
&gt; now, <br/>
&gt; &gt; make the next one better. Keep on trying. You are doing stuff <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; very few folks ever attempt.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Correct tools is vital for this. Honestly, you skimp on tools at<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; risk of getting discouraged and quitting.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The Speedball carving set with about four gouges in it is fine. I<br/>

Thank you for your reply. And thank all of you for putting up with <br/>
my dissatisfied whining over my meager stamp carving abilities.<br/>
 Yes, Mary... with so many 'parts' to this activity, there are <br/>
different focuses for different letterboxers. I can understand that. <br/>
Thanks for reminding me. <br/>
<br/>
 So I am still going to work on carving, but for now, my main focus <br/>
will be getting out there with our two oldest grandchildren and <br/>
looking for boxes while enjoying the scenery. :) <br/>

&gt; Oh, please don't feel like an outsider in a group of experts, <br/>
Wanda!  I, for one, have been boxing for about 3 yrs. and have only <br/>
carved two stamps, and neither is all that pretty!  :-)  Some of us <br/>
really could not care less for the artisitic end of the passtime, <br/>
and buy stamps.  Or we just don't want to devote the time and energy <br/>
to carving. To some, the clue-making, the solving, or the just-<br/>
getting-out-there is what it's all about.  If you want to perfect <br/>
your carving, go for it!  I've seen some awesome carved stamps, and <br/>
others I just can't even discern what the picture is supposed to <br/>
be. :::sigh:::  Other times, a store-bought stamp is just the right <br/>
one for a particular box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, have fun with whatever it is about l'boxing that floats <br/>
your boat (or moves your hiking shoes).  <br/>
