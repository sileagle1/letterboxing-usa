                    <div class="plaintext-content">Several of our boxes were set up by firmly planting our tongue into the side of our cheeks. We have definitely utilized political incorrectness to state a satirical side of several political points of view. Normally the subject matter may deal with local political points or other issues on environment or governmental intrusions. We haven't put out a DUBYA letterbox or a Kerry FlipFlop HH as I believe that we have enough polarization in the country, but to eliminate all political issues would certainly impact on one's first amendment rights. Use your judgement, and if your goal is to offend then be willing to accept the criticism.<br/>
