Just to let everyone know the UCD letterbox is a great hunt!  I will <br/>
be attempting to plant several letterboxes in the next two weeks <br/>
so if you get a chance to come to our little city I don't think you <br/>
would be disappointed.  <br/>

We have a great Farmers Market on Saturday from 7am-12pm  <br/>
and Wednesday evening from 4-8pm. On Wednesday evening it <br/>
is more like a picnic at the park with food venders, crafters and  <br/>
a <br/>
variety of musicans. <br/>
<br/>
Don't forget to visit our famous Toad Hotel by the post Office <br/>
while you are in town.<br/>
