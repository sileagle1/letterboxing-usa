When,,," thread would be a nice place to jump back in.<br/>

Our first find was the Dam Raccoon box, in Aug 03, planted by the <br/>
illustrious Don and Gwen in Oroville, CA.<br/>
<br/>
Our , um "stealth" was nowhere near as good as today, and we proceeded <br/>
to loudly, proudly and at length tell the park RANGERS (and anyone <br/>
else in earshot, I suppose) all about this wondrous new treasure hunt <br/>
hobby, and how the rangers had a letterbox RIGHT IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD!<br/>
<br/>
However, we are very happy to report that the box was"adopted" by the <br/>
Rangers and is still alive and well today, with a very recent (within <br/>
the last week) find!<br/>
