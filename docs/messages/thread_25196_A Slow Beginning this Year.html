                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our grandson, Alex, was 8 when we first took him boxing.    He picked his own trailname (Although he's changed it a couple of times since then, made his own logbook and stamp.  His first stamp was made from craft foam.  He drew a bat shape and cut it out with scissors and glued it to a thin piece of wood.  I scribed a few lines with an X-acto knife and he used an ice pick to make eyes.  The next year, he carved a new stamp using a speedball gouge.  He's 11 now.  This past summer I registered him with his own account on LbNA and recorded all his past finds. He carved a hithhicker and started it on its way.  He lives a couple of states away and the only times he had been boxing was when he visited us, but now his dad is beginning to get interested in going in their area Alex can add his new finds, and anyone who finds his hitchhiker can contact him directly.<br/>
