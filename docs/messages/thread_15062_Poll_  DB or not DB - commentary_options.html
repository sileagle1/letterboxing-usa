                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree! I haven't yet voted in that poll just because I don't agree<br/>
with either choice. I wouldn't use the database myself, but I don't<br/>
care if others do, just as long as it doesn't contain information that<br/>
would ruin the surprise inside the box or give away any hints that<br/>
would compromise the clues.<br/>
<br/>
People have been asking about a status database for so long that there<br/>
must be some use for it. Its an issue that will not go away and should<br/>
be addressed.<br/>
<br/>
However the current poll comes out, I think there is a place for a<br/>
status database, as long as it does not change the cryptic and<br/>
secretive aspects of letterboxing that first attracted so many of us<br/>
to the game. <br/>
<br/>
I think this issue has become so emotional simply because many people<br/>
view the secrecy and the surprise of discovery as a central appeal of<br/>
letterboxing and worry that too much information may change that.<br/>

I know that many are tiring of reading about the database, but here <br/>
is my response anyway - I myself entered a letterbox (that I had <br/>
placed in AZ) into the database and in the comments field ask that <br/>
finders contact me directly via the email address I entered. This is <br/>
probably quite impractical for letterboxers who have many boxes <br/>
placed out there. And I suppose a finder could just edit out my <br/>
comment and place their own in there...just an idea all the same.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, and in the spirit of sharing ideas (esp. with newer <br/>
members), I'd like to put this forward...I admit to not speaking for <br/>
everyone (surprise!) but I think few letterboxers have a problem <br/>
with others writing to the list and saying something like, "Hey, I <br/>
was thinking of looking for [XYZ] letterbox! Send me a private <br/>
message if you've found it recently, or if you want to comment about <br/>
it, or join me looking for it (!)." I think one is more likely to <br/>
get the information that is wanted that way, not to mention getting <br/>
into a dialogue with another person who shares an interest. Not <br/>
everyone will respond...but I think it's a good way of trying to <br/>
respectfully share information about the six thousand plus <br/>
letterboxes out there. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time,<br/>
