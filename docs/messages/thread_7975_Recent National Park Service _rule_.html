                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am relatively new to letterboxing, but would have to say that <br/>
during the course of the past few months and the boxes I have looked <br/>
for (some found, some not), I have frequently seen evidence that <br/>
would support the concerns of the NPS.  This includes everything from <br/>
noticable footpaths to boxes or clue landmarks that are located off <br/>
the path, to disturbed surroundings, overturned rocks, logs, holes in <br/>
the ground around trees, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that most people involved in the hobby are environmentally <br/>
responsible and practice a 'leave no trace' philosophy, but <br/>
unfortuntately a few irresponsible participants can ruin it for the <br/>
entire group.  And there is also the possibility that the <br/>
disturbances are not even caused by letterboxers, rather by vandals, <br/>
intentionally seeking a box to prank (as we have seen in recent <br/>
posts).<br/>
<br/>
I think the NPS has a basis for their decision.  While they no doubt <br/>
realize the majority of letterboxing activity is harmless and can <br/>
actually bring people to the park, they have to consider the whole <br/>
picture, and the fact that there have been problems and how it could <br/>
very quickly get out of control and something they would not be able <br/>
to monitor.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than being upset, our response should be to be more diligent <br/>
about our letterboxing activities and make sure we are being <br/>
responsible at all times, both in our searching and clue writing.  <br/>
While I agree with a comment that was previously made that the onus <br/>
is ultimately on the searcher, well written and desciptive clues <br/>
(particularly at the end) can certainly help this.  There is plenty <br/>
of opportunity to make clues puzzling and vague in the beginning <br/>
stages of a hunt that being descriptive about the hiding spot once <br/>
the person has actually reached it, is not giving it away and can <br/>
make the difference between somebody turning over every stone and <br/>
pulling leaves out of every rotting stump in the area.  Sure, even <br/>
then there is bound to be times where there is a hunt, but as a <br/>
searcher, it takes only a minute to put the leaves back, to replace <br/>
the stones you have peeked under, etc.  Most of what I have seen, is <br/>
just haste and carelessness -- somebody looked a few places before <br/>
finding a box and then after they found it, just left without <br/>
covering their tracks.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of other places to hide letterboxes than the <br/>
National Parks.  By taking advantage of these other opportunities to <br/>
demonstrate that we are a responsible group, perhaps some day the NPS <br/>
will change their stance.  Perhaps not.  Oh well, it's a huge country <br/>
and the NPS controls only a small portion of it.<br/>

&gt; And what about National Wildlife Refuge areas?<br/>
<br/>
Its been reported that these are off-limits as well (tho that <br/>
doesn't answer the question as to whose jurisdiction they are<br/>
in).  I will really find it bizarre if they allow drilling in<br/>
ANWR, but don't allow letterboxing (as apparently is the<br/>
current rule ...) ... but they claim they can do the drilling<br/>
with LNT ethics :-)<br/>
<br/>
I _am_ aware of one NWR that allows deer hunting (and doesn't<br/>
allow letterboxing).  I am not anti-hunting, but I would argue<br/>
that most reasonable people would view killing deer and going<br/>
off-trail in search of them as higher impact on the environment <br/>
than letterboxing (and why don't deer qualify as "wildlife" <br/>
anyway?), at least from a biomass metric.  Additionally, I've<br/>
seen plenty of shotgun shells at the location in question <br/>
(and I thought deer were hunted with rifles, that's how much<br/>
I know) -- anyway, one wonders why the NWS doesn't view these <br/>
shells in the same negative light as letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
To be perfectly frank about this, I feel the reasons given <br/>
by the NPS are, well, nevermind :-).  The fact of the matter <br/>
is that this issue started when geocaching was promoted, and<br/>
the NPS found out about it (and I'm not bashing geocaching,<br/>
it seems you need a disclaimer for everything ...).  The NPS <br/>
has a statute on their books against "leaving abandoned property".  <br/>
This was the statute that was quoted to "ban" geocaching and <br/>
letterboxing, before anyone did any sort of assessment, and <br/>
before either activity was popular enough to "leave traces".  <br/>
(Links to that original memo from the NPS are probably in this <br/>
archive, and are certainly in the geocaching yahoo group archive <br/>
(assuming that group still exists)).  This rule has nothing to <br/>
do with any of the reasons they currently quote.<br/>
<br/>
I think that they feel the activities are not as "wholesome",<br/>
"noble", "mature", etc., for the noble and high cultural <br/>
purposes the parks are supposed to represent.  My sense is<br/>
that its viewed as "kids playing hide and seek in an opera<br/>
house".  Too profane for the sanctity of the parks.  There is <br/>
no doubt in my mind that a box in the middle of Cascade NP, or <br/>
Denali NP is going to bother anyone or any biomass or cultural<br/>
situations.  I assure you that people climbing Denali (or el <br/>
Capitan) leave more trace than letterboxers  do.  But people <br/>
are allowed to.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that getting pissed off at the NPS is a non-starter.<br/>
I would think emphasizing the "cultural and educational value" of <br/>
letterboxing is the way to go ... I'm not claiming my clues are<br/>
anything special, but I will claim you will need to be educated<br/>
in the same sort of cultural and historical perspectives to find<br/>
them that the park people claim to wish provide to their visitors<br/>
(I could go on, but I don't want to ...)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>On the subject of hunting, the NPS requires special permits for the right to hunt their land. Since they have an economic interest, banning the practice would be detrimental to them. This is above and beyond the licences that hunters and fisherman need from the state in which they live. 
<br/>
<br/>As for National Monuments, I am currently working with the Springfield Armory, which is run by the Park Service, to get permission to place two boxes on their property. One will be inside the old armory building itself, the other out on the grounds. I think we must try to engage the people that actually work at these sites, and get permission on a case by case basis. If we can do this, and show that we are responsible folks who are an asset to the park system, we'll have a better chance of getting this ban overturned.
<br/>
<br/>Incidentally, does anyone know where this official policy is recorded?
<br/>
<br/>As a final question, to those of us in the Massachusetts area, does anyone know if the Trustees of the Reservations have an official policy regarding letterboxes? I know we've already planted on some of their reservations (I've done one myself), but now I'm wondering if we'll have this problem with them as well.

place two <br/>
&gt; boxes on their property. One will be inside the old armory building <br/>
itself, <br/>
&gt; the other out on the grounds. I think we must try to engage the <br/>
people that <br/>
&gt; actually work at these sites, and get permission on a case by case <br/>
basis. If <br/>
&gt; we can do this, and show that we are responsible folks who are an <br/>
asset to <br/>
&gt; the park system, we'll have a better chance of getting this ban <br/>
overturned.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Incidentally, does anyone know where this official policy is <br/>
recorded?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a final question, to those of us in the Massachusetts area, does <br/>
anyone <br/>
&gt; know if the Trustees of the Reservations have an official policy <br/>
regarding <br/>
&gt; letterboxes? I know we've already planted on some of their <br/>
reservations (I've <br/>
&gt; done one myself), but now I'm wondering if we'll have this problem <br/>
with them <br/>
&gt; as well. <br/>

&gt; In reading the NPS official rules, it addresses both letterboxing and<br/>
&gt; geo-caching as activities which require authorization.  It sounds as<br/>
&gt; though this has gone beyond that to outrightly say "no."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree - they don't seem to be following their own rules.  Any lawyers out<br/>
there?<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that this is NOT just a NPS issue.  State parks are getting<br/>
on board too.  And what happens when city parks follow suit?  There may be<br/>
plenty of "other" places to hide boxes now, but will that be the case in 5<br/>
years?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">--  Very well written SpringChick. This explains why I haven't been <br/>
able to locate Squirrels Mystery Box. I'm sure I was in the right <br/>
place but found nothing. I can't be sure but I think Squirrel has her <br/>
first confiscation. <br/>
    What bothers me is their(NPS) concern for boxes and caches but <br/>
the garbage is overwhelming. No trash cans or bags provided for easy <br/>
clean-up. I personally have picked up full bags of beer cans, soda <br/>
cans and food wrappers. I realize these are left by ignorant people. <br/>
I do notice that in every State Park that I have visited, there isn't <br/>
this problem. Maybe the NPS should get a lesson from State Park <br/>
Officials.<br/>

&gt; I am relatively new to letterboxing, but would have to say that <br/>
&gt; during the course of the past few months and the boxes I have <br/>
looked <br/>
&gt; for (some found, some not), I have frequently seen evidence that <br/>
&gt; would support the concerns of the NPS.  This includes everything <br/>
from <br/>
&gt; noticable footpaths to boxes or clue landmarks that are located off <br/>
&gt; the path, to disturbed surroundings, overturned rocks, logs, holes <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; the ground around trees, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I realize that most people involved in the hobby are <br/>
environmentally <br/>
&gt; responsible and practice a 'leave no trace' philosophy, but <br/>
&gt; unfortuntately a few irresponsible participants can ruin it for the <br/>
&gt; entire group.  And there is also the possibility that the <br/>
&gt; disturbances are not even caused by letterboxers, rather by <br/>
vandals, <br/>
&gt; intentionally seeking a box to prank (as we have seen in recent <br/>
&gt; posts).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the NPS has a basis for their decision.  While they no <br/>
doubt <br/>
&gt; realize the majority of letterboxing activity is harmless and can <br/>
&gt; actually bring people to the park, they have to consider the whole <br/>
&gt; picture, and the fact that there have been problems and how it <br/>
could <br/>
&gt; very quickly get out of control and something they would not be <br/>
able <br/>
&gt; to monitor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rather than being upset, our response should be to be more diligent <br/>
&gt; about our letterboxing activities and make sure we are being <br/>
&gt; responsible at all times, both in our searching and clue writing.  <br/>
&gt; While I agree with a comment that was previously made that the onus <br/>
&gt; is ultimately on the searcher, well written and desciptive clues <br/>
&gt; (particularly at the end) can certainly help this.  There is plenty <br/>
&gt; of opportunity to make clues puzzling and vague in the beginning <br/>
&gt; stages of a hunt that being descriptive about the hiding spot once <br/>
&gt; the person has actually reached it, is not giving it away and can <br/>
&gt; make the difference between somebody turning over every stone and <br/>
&gt; pulling leaves out of every rotting stump in the area.  Sure, even <br/>
&gt; then there is bound to be times where there is a hunt, but as a <br/>
&gt; searcher, it takes only a minute to put the leaves back, to replace <br/>
&gt; the stones you have peeked under, etc.  Most of what I have seen, <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; just haste and carelessness -- somebody looked a few places before <br/>
&gt; finding a box and then after they found it, just left without <br/>
&gt; covering their tracks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are plenty of other places to hide letterboxes than the <br/>
&gt; National Parks.  By taking advantage of these other opportunities <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; demonstrate that we are a responsible group, perhaps some day the <br/>
NPS <br/>
&gt; will change their stance.  Perhaps not.  Oh well, it's a huge <br/>
country <br/>
&gt; and the NPS controls only a small portion of it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The link Deb gave us is for a document from the NPS's Prince William <br/>
Forest Park.  This was helpful because it told us what law, i.e., <br/>
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) the NPS is relying on.  Actually, <br/>
the provision on page 11 is more hopeful than the NO LETTERBOX rule <br/>
from the C&amp;O Canal NHP in that at least PWFP allows approved <br/>
letterboxes.  It looks like each park superintendent can decide what <br/>
to allow, according to 36 CFR 2.22(a)(2).  What is interesting is <br/>
that the C&amp;O Canal and PWFP are both in the same NPS region (at least <br/>
they used to be a few years ago) and the superintendents report to <br/>
the same Regional Director.  It seems to me that C&amp;O Canal's decision <br/>
not to allow letterboxes may not reflect the decision of other parks, <br/>
not even other parks in the same regional jurisdiction.  Isn't there <br/>
a letterbox on Theodore Roosevelt Island that hasn't been <br/>
confiscated?  That's an NPS area - I think the George Washington <br/>
Memorial Parkway handles that park and it is under still another <br/>
superintendent in the same Region.  So I don't think there is a rigid <br/>
rule about this; just ask first.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to read exactly what 36 CRF 2.22 says, here it is:<br/>
<br/>
TITLE 36--PARKS, FORESTS, AND PUBLIC PROPERTY<br/>
<br/>
CHAPTER I--NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR<br/>
<br/>
PART 2--RESOURCE PROTECTION, PUBLIC USE AND RECREATION--Table of <br/>
Contents<br/>
<br/>
Sec. 2.22  Property.<br/>
<br/>
(a) The following are prohibited:<br/>
(1) Abandoning property.<br/>
(2) Leaving property unattended for longer than 24 hours, except in <br/>
locations where longer time periods have been designated or in <br/>
accordance with conditions established by the superintendent.<br/>
(3) Failing to turn in found property to the superintendent as soon <br/>
as practicable.<br/>
<br/>
b) Impoundment of property. <br/>
(1) Property determined to be left unattended in excess of an allowed <br/>
period of time may be impounded by the superintendent.<br/>
(2) Unattended property that interferes with visitor safety, orderly <br/>
management of the park area, or presents a threat to park resources <br/>
may be impounded by the superintendent at any time.<br/>
(3) Found or impounded property shall be inventoried to determine <br/>
ownership and safeguard personal property.<br/>
(4) The owner of record is responsible and liable for charges to the <br/>
person who has removed, stored, or otherwise disposed of property <br/>
impounded pursuant to this section; or the superintendent may assess <br/>
the owner reasonable fees for the impoundment and storage of property <br/>
impounded pursuant to this section.<br/>
<br/>
(c) Disposition of property. <br/>
(1) Unattended property impounded pursuant to this section shall be <br/>
deemed to be abandoned unless claimed by the owner or an authorized <br/>
representative thereof within 60 days. The 60-day period shall begin <br/>
when the rightful owner of the property has been notified, if the <br/>
owner can be identified, or from the time the property was placed in <br/>
the superintendent's custody, if the owner cannot be identified.<br/>
(2) Unclaimed, found property shall be stored for a minimum period <br/>
of 60 days and, unless claimed by the owner or an authorized <br/>
representative thereof, may be claimed by the finder, provided that <br/>
the finder is not an employee of the National Park Service. Found <br/>
property not claimed by the owner or an authorized representative or <br/>
the finder shall be deemed abandoned.<br/>
(3) Abandoned property shall be disposed of in accordance with title <br/>
41 Code of Federal Regulations.<br/>
(4) Property, including real property, located within a park area <br/>
and owned by a deceased person, shall be disposed of in accordance <br/>
with the laws of the State within whose exterior boundaries the <br/>
property is located.<br/>
<br/>
d) The regulations contained in paragraphs (a)(2), (b) and (c) of <br/>
this section apply, regardless of land ownership, on all lands and <br/>
waters within a park area that are under the legislative jurisdiction <br/>
of the United States.<br/>
