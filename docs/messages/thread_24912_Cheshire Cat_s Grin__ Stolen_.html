Yeah, I see what you mean, but in fairness, I'm pretty sure that was a<br/>
tongue-in-cheek explanation of what might have occurred!<br/>
<br/>
And as a note about getting along harmoniously with geocachers:<br/>
<br/>
In my neck of the woods at least (NE Texas), I've discovered geocachers to<br/>
be quite human-like.  We have virtually no problem with cachers taking<br/>
stamps or boxes or removing boxes to put their caches in place (one incident<br/>
that I know of of that happening in the Dallas area - and that cacher was a<br/>
real JERK!).  I think the key has been that local geocachers and boxers<br/>
actually talk and each group has taken the time to learn some about the<br/>
other game.  Consequently, we work together and put notes in both box and<br/>
cache clues to indicate that their may be another stash nearby and what to<br/>
do if you find it.  We have numerous boxes that are within feet of caches<br/>
and they get along just fine!<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't hurt to get smart about geocaching in your area, especially if<br/>
you are a planter.  Look up caches on geocaching.com by zip code to see who<br/>
the players are, then see if you can get to know them.  Some of them are<br/>
jerks, just as some letterboxers are jerks, but geocachers are for the most<br/>
part courteous, just as most letterboxers are courteous.  A little<br/>
communication goes a long way, and the source of problems is usually<br/>
ignorance and not malice, and thankfully ignorance is fixable!<br/>

&gt; Hey, Lucy,,,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've not got too many finds to my name, but, in the short time I've <br/>
&gt; been boxing, I've run across 2 geocaches while looking for <br/>
&gt; letterboxes... I'm sure geocachers do the same thing.  I read up on <br/>
&gt; geocacheing, so know what's up, and I reckon, as you said, most of <br/>
&gt; them have too.<br/>
