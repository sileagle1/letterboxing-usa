As with most past-times, things evolve over time. Postal Letterboxes<br/>
are an offshoot of letterboxing in that one signs up on a mailing list<br/>
and then the letterbox is physically "posted" (aka mailed) to one's<br/>
house. The receiver must mail the package to the next person on the<br/>
list and so on and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
It's a fun way to see stamps that one might not see from others across<br/>
the country and it's also a good boredom buster when letterboxing is<br/>
difficult in the winter - especially in some of these northeastern states.<br/>
<br/>
Folks, correct me if I'm wrong here - but I think interest in postal<br/>
boxes just recently surged but some of the original ideas were put<br/>
forth by greats in the letterboxing world such as Legerdemaine's<br/>
"Flutterby" (the box that finds you) and Wanda &amp; Pete's "Sunny Message<br/>
in a Bottle" and others.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that answers your question! and I hope that one finds your<br/>
mailbox sometime as they're great fun. <br/>
