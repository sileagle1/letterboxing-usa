Breathe and now it's time to get carving!  <br/>
<br/>
CALL FOR BOXES<br/>
The Planning Committee would like to invite the entire letterboxing <br/>
community to be a part of the Live &amp; Breathe event by creating a box <br/>
for it.  We are interested in casting a wide net for carvers from <br/>
every corner of the US and beyond.  Even if you are not able to <br/>
attend, you can `represent' via a box created for the event.  If you <br/>
are attending the event and are thinking of bringing a box, we would <br/>
love to have it prior to the event so it can be planted and included <br/>
in the official clue packet.<br/>
<br/>
The Live &amp; Breathe event is intended as a celebration of letterboxing <br/>
in the US.  We want to encourage you to think outside the box (pun <br/>
intended) and this is the perfect opportunity to showcase your <br/>
creativity.  Ideally, it would be most helpful to send us the `full <br/>
monty' - stamp, logbook and container.  It would be great to see some <br/>
really creative containers as well.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to contribute, please contact Marmalade, L&amp;B Box Wrangler <br/>
at directoroffun@hotmail.com to indicate your interest. We will be <br/>
planting during August and would need to have the boxes to us between <br/>
August 8th and 15th.  If it's ready to go before that, send it.<br/>
<br/>
THEME IDEAS<br/>
	Our letterboxing roots, i.e. all things English<br/>
	American or British legends, myths and folklore<br/>
	A great place to letterbox<br/>
	Letterboxing is  (aspects you enjoy about letterboxing)<br/>
<br/>
OTHER TYPES OF BOXES<br/>
In addition, we are also offering some guidelines regarding cooties, <br/>
Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) boxes, hitchhikers and event stamps. <br/>
With so large a gathering, it could be easy to be overrun with HIPS <br/>
and cooties, enough that the fun could quickly turn to annoyance.  We <br/>
ask that cooties or HIPS be limited to the theme of the event and <br/>
allow one per family.  This probably isn't the best event for <br/>
hitchhikers, since moving from one box to another doesn't really <br/>
advance the hitchhiker.  And we're sure you'll understand that event <br/>
stamps are the prerogative of the organizers.  <br/>
<br/>
PLANTING POLICY<br/>
Because we are holding the Live &amp; Breathe event on over 200 acres of <br/>
private property, all of the boxes we plant will need to be retrieved <br/>
at the end of the weekend.  We will not be able to leave any box as a <br/>
permanent plant.  This holds true for boxes planted early by the <br/>
committee or boxes planted during the event.  Every box MUST be <br/>
pulled at the end of the event.  <br/>
<br/>
If you plant a box during the event, you are responsible to do two <br/>
things:<br/>
	Notify Marmalade that you are planting.  We need to be aware <br/>
that there is a box on the premises so we can fulfill our agreement <br/>
with the camp.  <br/>
	Pull the box at the end of the event, and let us know you <br/>
have done so.<br/>
<br/>
We also expect everyone to adhere to the letterboxing philosophy <br/>
of `Leave No Trace'. It is inexcusable to create social trails, alter <br/>
or damage trees, cabins or other structures, or leave any evidence or <br/>
impact. The camp is aware of our letterboxing activities, which makes <br/>
leaving no impact on the property even more important. Please keep <br/>
this in mind as you are designing and planting any box.  Remember <br/>
that your actions reflect on the entire hobby and how it is viewed by <br/>
the public, as well as the event organizers and any liability issues.<br/>
<br/>
AFTER THE EVENT<br/>
We can offer some options as to what can be done with your box at the <br/>
conclusion of Live &amp; Breathe, so letterboxers can continue to enjoy <br/>
these creations.  Please let us know your preferences as to how you <br/>
want your box handled.<br/>
	Your box can be re-planted in the Pacific Northwest area.  <br/>
When replanted, the plant location/directions would be sent to you <br/>
and you would be responsible to list the plant, according to your <br/>
preferences.  If you want the box to remain in the area, but wish the <br/>
original image to be excusive to Live &amp; Breathe, consider designing <br/>
the image so it can be altered after the event.  Please send us <br/>
instructions on your alteration plan.<br/>
	You can request your box be returned to you after the event.  <br/>
You will need to provide postage for the return of your box.<br/>
	If we have a number of images that work well together, the <br/>
L&amp;B Planning Committee has considered gathering these together as a <br/>
traveling event box to be sent to other gatherings.  <br/>
<br/>
In addition to the fame and recognition you'll receive, the Planning <br/>
Committee will have a token of appreciation for everyone who sends us <br/>
a box in advance.  With your participation, we'll have an amazing <br/>
array of boxes to hunt and we thank you for your efforts.<br/>
