<p align="center">SUGAR HILL LETTERBOX, SCHUYLER COUNTY, NY</p>
<p></p>State Forests crown many of the glaciated hills in the 
southern Finger Lakes. Sugar Hill, located about seven miles west of Watkins 
Glen, and giving rise to the Glen Creek that carved the famous gorge there, is 
among the highest at 2,100 ft. The <i>Sugar Hill Recreation Area</i> includes a 
campground with primitive facilities, field archery courses, the extensive Six 
Nations horse-trails and four lean-tos located on or handy to the Finger Lakes 
Trail. Snow-mobiling and XC-skiing take advantage of the greater depth and 
longer duration of snow cover at high elevation. 
<p>The Recreation Area is maintained by the New York State Department of 
Environmental Conservation (Region 7, Bath, NY) and administered and policed by 
a local forest ranger. Area rules are posted in a new kiosk, and the fire tower 
can be climbed to, but not into, the summit cabin for a fine view above the 
trees of the south-central Finger Lakes. The gate controlling access to the 
summit and campground is usually closed from November through April but 
it’s only a ¼-mile walk. Camping is on a no-fee basis, but there 
are limits to duration and group-size.</p>
<p>DIRECTIONS:</p>
<p></p>At the junction of NY 14 and NY 414 in the village of 
Watkins Glen, proceed west on NY 409, turning up the hill at Milliken’s 
Corners (of racing fame) for a half-mile before bearing off to the right on CR 
28. A mile farther, take the left fork that becomes CR 23. Continuing over the 
tracks and uphill until 6.5 miles from the village intersection, you’ll 
find a sign for the Sugar Hill Recreation Area at CR 21. Turn left (south) for 
one mile on CR 21 and then west again at another sign on Tower Hill Road to the 
top of the hill. 
<p>For an approach from the west, though less direct, the same CR 23 intersects 
NY 226 four miles farther west at Tyrone and continues on over hill and dale and 
between two little lakes toward Hammondsport and Bath. This is the western 
continuation of the historic Catskill Turnpike that provided an alternative 
route to western New York south of the Finger Lakes, when the region was settled 
after the Revolutionary War.</p>
<p>THE SUGAR HILL LETTERBOX</p>
<p></p>[A century and more ago maple sugar vied 
with cane as the sweetener of choice, and many came in season to set up camp and 
tap the native sugar maples on hilltops that had largely remained wooded.]

<p>CLUES</p>
<ol></ol>
<li>Having gained the top of the hill near the fire-tower, go first to the 
    recently-built kiosk to read the Recreation Area rules and take in the 
    handsome map of the Six Nations Horse Trails. It also includes the route of 
    the Finger Lakes Trail, traced in white on the map; in the woods it’s 
    marked with white blazes. A spur trail (blue-blazed) leads to the firetower 
    from the FLT just a quarter-mile down the hill to the southwest near the 
    twin lean-tos. </li>
<li>Nearby is a sign suspended between two posts and emblazoned "State 
    of New York Department of Environmental Conservation / Sugar Hill Recreation 
    Area". This is your starting point.</li>
<li>With your back to the sign, align your compass to 104 degrees and find, 
    just visible between two closely-spaced trees, a spot of orange paint in the 
    distance (78 paces). Arriving at the hydrant, take care now that the steel 
    pipe does not affect your compass reading for the next leg. (You should 
    stand apart from it, on one side or the other, and compensate for any 
    resulting errors of direction or distance.)</li>
<li>Now at 130 degrees walk to the lonely white pine 36 paces away.</li>
<li>The new bearing is now 20 degrees, and 38 paces will bring you between 
    two piles of spoil at the edge of the forest.</li>
<li>Trying not to focus on imagined dangers of leaving the relative safety 
    of the clearing (and possibly the company of campers therein), bravely set 
    out into the forest on a bearing of 50 degrees for 65 paces, stepped off 
    with some difficulty through the forest litter. </li>
<li>The remnants of an old stone wall is encountered at a group of three 
    maples of moderate size (remember the sugar saga ?); the letterbox you seek 
    is hidden nearby. Success is so sweet !</li>
