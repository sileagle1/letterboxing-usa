                    <div class="plaintext-content">WOW!  The Haunted Harvest Gathering is turning out to be much bigger than we<br/>
originally anticipated.  It sounds like we may have over 70 people attending<br/>
and over 40 boxes.<br/>
<br/>
We're excited that so many newer boxers plan to attend and impressed that<br/>
several have even created their first boxes for this event.<br/>
<br/>
One bit of bad news is that when I received the Great Lakes patches last<br/>
month they only sent a partial quantity and I STILL haven't received the<br/>
rest of the order. I'm hoping they arrive this week because I only have a<br/>
few available for some of you who pre-ordered and wanted to pick them up at<br/>
the gathering.  (And for those of you who mailed me your money recently, I<br/>
haven't mailed yours out yet, waiting for the remainder of the shipment).<br/>
Hopefully this will be resolved soon so everyone that wants a patch will get<br/>
one.  The company is trying to expedite the order so I'm keeping my fingers<br/>
crossed.<br/>
<br/>
On to better news:  I've been getting more email about what people plan to<br/>
bring for the potluck and have been updating the website accordingly.  If<br/>
you haven't decided yet, you could follow the "Harvest" theme and bring some<br/>
veggies or fruit.  Other ideas are cheese, appetizers and other  main or<br/>
side dishes.  Remember that a large industrial size refrigerator is<br/>
available as well as electrical outlets and a microwave.<br/>
<br/>
The weather forecast looks pretty good for Saturday - "Partly cloudy. Highs<br/>
in the lower 70s."  However if we do have bad weather we have space inside<br/>
the building and a sizable covered patio with picnic tables.  I'll be<br/>
bringing along some supplies for making logbooks and activities for the kids<br/>
in case the weather doesn't cooperate.<br/>
<br/>
As many of you already know, we'll have the pleasure of seeing some of<br/>
Phineas Boch's Traveling Circus at the gathering.  They have settled in for<br/>
2 weeks of performances in Wisconsin under the temporary leadership of<br/>
Ringmistress Felka Lechsinska.  If you'd like to meet Felka at the<br/>
gathering, you'll need to tell Wisconsin Hiker or Martini Man the<br/>
origin/meaning of her name.<br/>
<br/>
If you plan to attend the gathering and haven't already RSVP'd, please do so<br/>
by Wednesday to be sure you receive a clue packet.  All details regarding<br/>
attendees, potluck items, maps, FAQ, etc can be found on the  gathering<br/>
website:  http://www.hauntedharvest.homestead.com/<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're looking forward to meeting everyone on Saturday and hope to have a<br/>
"hauntingly" good time!<br/>
<br/>
