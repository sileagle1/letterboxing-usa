                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to say what a special trip we had going up to Prayer <br/>
Rock in VT last weekend.  It actually felt like we were making a <br/>
pilgrimage going up there to Bristol, VT to visit the first official <br/>
LbNA letterbox in North America planted by LbNA co-founder Erik <br/>
Davis back in April of 1998!  We were all saddened by his recent <br/>
passing, but he has truly left a remarkable legacy.  It was <br/>
wonderful to meet his children, Anna and Ben, and his wife, <br/>
Susan, who was carving an incredible on-the-spot <br/>
commemorative stamp with some of Erik's special symbols <br/>
right there at the picnic table as we arrived!  It was also a big <br/>
surprise to meet Chris, author of that now famous Smithsonian <br/>
article on letterboxing that got everything started over here in <br/>
North America!  Team Green Dragon made it from MA, and Rich <br/>
and friend came from NH, so we had a nice little group.  Susan <br/>
showed us the beautiful nearby waterfalls just before the <br/>
heavens opened up for some heavy rain showers, but we were <br/>
still able to find several other of their early boxes in the area <br/>
afterwards, including some that hadn't been visited for nearly a <br/>
year!  We really enjoyed the warm welcoming spirit of <br/>
letterboxing, as started out by the Davises, and we hope that <br/>
many more letterboxers will have a chance to make a special trip <br/>
up to Vermont, too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete<br/>
