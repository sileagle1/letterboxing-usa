gobbledygook in my post. Very weird.  Anyway , I'll correct them at <br/>
the bottom here.&gt; Hi all, this box was placed by Sole Searching, and <br/>
I am forwarding <br/>
&gt; the clues for him :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "It's a Secret: Hearts Blossom"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Placed 8/14/02 by Sole Searching<br/>
&gt; Inniswood Metro Gardens<br/>
&gt; Westerville, OH<br/>
&gt; Franklin County<br/>
&gt; Bring stamp pad and pen<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This box was placed in honor of my daughter's first birthday.  The <br/>
&gt; name stems from what my fast-growing daughter inspired me to <br/>
inscribe <br/>
&gt; on this stamp and what my son proclaimed to me as we planted this <br/>
&gt; letterbox (which is also a small clue).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Inniswood is located at 940 South Hempstead Road, Westerville, OH <br/>
&gt; 43081 (northern Franklin County)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From I-270, take the S.R. 3/Westerville Rd. exit south to Dempsey <br/>
Rd. <br/>
&gt; and turn left. Go about 1 mile to Hempstead Rd. and turn left. <br/>
&gt; Entrance is about 1/2 mile on the right. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the bulletin board which serves as the entrance to the park <br/>
(on <br/>
&gt; the north side of the parking lot at approximately N 40 degrees <br/>
6.05' W 82 degrees<br/>
&gt; 53.95') head north into the park for approximately 35 steps.  I <br/>
chose <br/>
&gt; to use steps rather than paces, as two of my steps are definitely <br/>
not <br/>
&gt; equal to one pace, a little more than five feet.  From here, head <br/>
320<br/>
&gt; ï‚° for 45 steps, then head down the path at 290 degrees for <br/>
approximately 132 <br/>
&gt; steps.  You should now see a sculpture titled "Untitled."  From the <br/>
&gt; plaque at the base of the sculpture, head due north for 44 steps <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; have a seat.  There are two trees directly in front of the bench <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; signs identifying them.  What do the larger of the two trees and <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; figurine to your right have in common?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the bench, head down the winding footpath at 90 degrees for <br/>
&gt; approximately 100 steps through the grassy area.  Turn left at the <br/>
&gt; paved path and continue for approximately 160 steps.  Be observant <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; the place names on the signs.  At this point, you will be at a fork <br/>
&gt; in the path.  Do you remember what the tree and the figurine had in <br/>
&gt; common?  Head in the direction of the appropriately titled garden <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; approximately 50 steps.  If you have turned the correct way, you <br/>
&gt; should see a small cottage.  Enter the cottage and read the board <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; the north side of the cottage.  The very last words will tell you <br/>
&gt; where you must head now.  Hint (until the park's maps are updated): <br/>
&gt; it is down the path heading in the opposite direction of where you <br/>
&gt; turned to come to this garden.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you enter this new garden, pay close attention to numbers of <br/>
&gt; items or objects (hint: the sunflowers, the sisters, etc.).  Next <br/>
&gt; stand over the plaque in the pavement for the Entry Garden.  Head <br/>
&gt; down the path at 40 degrees and follow the start of the maze.  <br/>
Enjoy the <br/>
&gt; story as you wander through the maze.  After reading the story <br/>
&gt; continue on through the maze, past the Grandfather Tree, and into <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; next circular area.  From the center of the circle, head down the <br/>
&gt; path at 75 degrees.  Walk under the "arches" and head to the brick <br/>
&gt; building.  Look at the plaque on the wall.  Now you understand the <br/>
&gt; name.  Enter the building and read all of the wonderful quotations <br/>
&gt; and look at the bird sculptures.  After you have thoroughly <br/>
&gt; investigated this wonderful garden, sit on the south side of the <br/>
bird <br/>
&gt; in the fountain.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here is where we test if you have paid attention.  Add the number <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; panels in the "Earth on Turtle's Back" story, the number of <br/>
&gt; sunflowers at the entrance of the garden, and the number of <br/>
sisters.  <br/>
&gt; Now subtract the number of birds you see in the garden you are now <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; as well as the number of quotations.  Now multiply this number by <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; number of roots of the tree in the story.  This number will give <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; the bearing to look out at the wall of the building in which you <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; now sitting.  In the wall will be an open space with a rock in it <br/>
&gt; that does not belong.  The letterbox is located behind this rock.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a fairly busy park, please use discretion when stamping and <br/>
&gt; rehiding.  Enjoy.<br/>
