                    <div class="plaintext-content">When we put out "Honor Liberty" on 9/11/2002 we included information with it indicating that the PRESENT location should be posted on the chat list. This did occur with many letterboxers posting info the first year. After we received her back and we posted the comments, then returned her to the letterboxing community, we found that some letterboxers treated her as you might any other HH. Now she is stuck somewhere, possibly in Frazer, PA. We placed several notes inside, outside the container, and with the log as well as the listing on Pete &amp; Wanda's page on how to handle this hitch hiker. We would like the HH returned so that comments made regarding 9/11/2001 could be posted.  Anyone know where she might be?<br/>
