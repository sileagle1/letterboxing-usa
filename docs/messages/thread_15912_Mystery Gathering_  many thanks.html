who made the mystery gathering such a success.  Although The <br/>
Yachtsman and I did not partake of the journal making class(I do not <br/>
enjoy hand stitching because of a carpal tunnel problem), we had the <br/>
pleasure of wandering about Wickford with CSCM and Rustypuff in the <br/>
light, and with Team Greendragon and Solor and Binx after dark.  Lots <br/>
of fun, including meeting "Happy Stamper".  The day was topped off by <br/>
more refreshment in Wickford and a late arrival home.  We had a great <br/>
time and enjoyed meeting and re-meeting everyone.  Safe travels to <br/>
the Psychokiwis -- you will be missed!<br/>
