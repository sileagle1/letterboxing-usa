                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funny! I think Ryan's goal is to plant a box in each state as he <br/>
hikes through and become the first letterboxer to do a hike/plant <br/>
thru. Wanda is the first letterboxer to do the walk thru.<br/>
<br/>
The Hiker<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My bet is that he will never make it at all.  I think his whole <br/>
&gt; adventure is just a virtual one.  He is really sitting in in home <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; Portland Oregon and making the whole thing up.  You see, he <br/>
&gt; spent all of his savings traveling around this last year and now <br/>
&gt; he is secretly working at Jack in the Box to make ends meet.  <br/>
&gt; I will say this though, he has a very vivid imagination.<br/>
