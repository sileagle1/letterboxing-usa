Campgaw Mountain Reservation<br/>
Placed 04/29/01, Refreshed 04/06/03 by Wingfoot<br/>
Mahwah, NJ, Bergen County<br/>
<br/>
Campgaw is the Ramapo Indian word for "Goose." Campgaw Mountain Reservation <br/>
is located in Mahwah, New Jersey. Mahwah means, "open fields" in the Ramapo <br/>
Indian language.<br/>
<br/>
There are two things to keep in mind before setting out for this letterbox.<br/>
Don't go looking after a heavy rain.<br/>
Don't go during ski season.<br/>
<br/>
Campgaw Letterbox   planted 04/29/01<br/>
<br/>
Start at the Hemlock trail (Orange).  At the intersection of paths, take and <br/>
stay on the Indian trail (Yellow).  Take left up the log stairs staying on <br/>
the yellow trail (very rocky here).  Trail merges with XC trail.  Cross pipe <br/>
when yellow trail indicates you to do so.  Enjoy the view.  You'll see a pole <br/>
marking the end of the yellow &amp; blue trails.  Take white trail on left of <br/>
pole heading west.  On the right of the path a short ways down you'll see a <br/>
tree with a sign on it that says "End of Trail". If you start going down the <br/>
red trail, you've gone too far. From the tree with the sign go 12 paces at 15 <br/>
degrees.  At this point you'll see a big log. A small log lies across the big <br/>
log.  Underneath where the small log lies across the big log, behind a rock, <br/>
is what you're searching for. <br/>
<br/>
Wingfoot's 10th Letterbox   replanted 04/06/03<br/>
<br/>
This box was originally a part of the Turkey Mountain series, put was <br/>
replaced by the In Memory Letterbox on 09/15/01.  It is now being replanted.<br/>
<br/>
Go back and pick up white trail going the way you didn't come.  When you come <br/>
to the red trail on the right side of the trail take it.  Continue following <br/>
red trail.  Near the bottom you'll see a fallen blazed tree lying across the <br/>
trail.  From that spot go 10 paces at 40 degrees to a tree.  On the far side <br/>
of the tree, under a pile of rocks is what you seek.   Rehide box after <br/>
stamping in.  Go back and pick up red trail going the way you didn't come.  <br/>
Cross bridge and then cross parking lot heading to the southeast corner.  <br/>
You'll see a sign that says "Service road, do not enter".  Southeast of that <br/>
sign is a sewer.  Go to the sewer and take unblazed trail down towards lake.  <br/>
At lake take a right and pick up orange trail.  Orange trail takes you back <br/>
to your starting point.         <br/>
