<br/>
Kudos to RTRW and SKW for their first-rate "Cedar Hill Cemetery" letterboxes, <br/>
which I was fortunate enough to snag on Sunday, the last full day of summer. <br/>
This series, in my opinion, is a near-perfect confluence of a fascinating <br/>
locale (chock full of history); an interesting and informative walk (but not <br/>
too strenuous); an array of clever, well-written clues; and five beautifully <br/>
carved stamps. Like so many letterboxing adventures, this one gave me the <br/>
opportunity to explore yet another place that would otherwise have likely <br/>
been ignored in my travels. It's almost embarrassing to admit that, in my <br/>
nearly 30 years as a Connecticut resident (mostly spent in the Hartford <br/>
area), I had never been to Cedar Hill Cemetery until today. I guess it's true <br/>
that most of us take for granted those special places that are virtually in <br/>
our backyards.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, I proceeded to nearby Charter Oak Landing by the Connecticut <br/>
River where I found the "Sharp Dressed Man" letterbox. It is indeed sharp! As <br/>
a bonus, I met fellow letterboxer Christi from Wethersfield, who was heading <br/>
up the path that leads to the box just as I was heading back from stamping <br/>
in. We exchanged stamps and swapped some letterboxing stories, and Christi <br/>
introduced me to her husband and baby (hi, guys! <waves <br="" at="" computer="" the="">
screen&gt;). It turns out that Christi was the first letterboxer to stamp into <br/>
the Cedar Hill Cemetery series (I knew that stamp of hers looked awfully <br/>
familar!). How's that for serendipity?<br/>
<br/>
My final destination of the day was beautiful Elizabeth Park on the <br/>
Hartford/West Hartford line. There, I was rewarded with a warm, sunny, <br/>
late-Sunday afternoon walk through the park's awesome gardens on my way to my <br/>
last letterbox of the day. Elizabeth Park is a wonderful urban park which <br/>
harkens back to another, more genteel time when the rhythms of life were <br/>
slower. This is a place best enjoyed and appreciated at a leisurely pace.<br/>
<br/>
Days like today remind me why I enjoy letterboxing so much!<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Alan from Axtown<br/>
