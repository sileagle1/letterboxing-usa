&gt; It was a wonderful surprise to have these roving stamps<br/>
&gt; at our gather. We enjoyed all of them. Cheese Racing,<br/>
&gt; however, inspired the most discussion with everyone <br/>
&gt; taking sides. <br/>

brought <br/>

&gt; &gt; the VA:DC:MD Winter Icebreaker gathering.  I think she brought <br/>
them <br/>
&gt; &gt; from the recent Idaho gather.<br/>
