Finally - a day where the schedule and the weather cooperated and Team<br/>
Bigguy could mount a letterboxing expedition! Although the forecast<br/>
called for rain, we took a chance and set off eastward from Jackson<br/>
this morning. Stopped in Athens and collected 'Shark in the Park!'<br/>
and 'QAE' by Froggiebaby. It proved to be the perfect day to collect<br/>
these two - there was almost nobody around. We finally surmized it<br/>
must be spring break for the denizens of Harvard on the Hocking (as<br/>
the old editor of our local paper always called it.) The Ohio<br/>
University campus is quite lovely and looks to be prosperous with a<br/>
lot of new buildings. I imagine the 'QAE' box could be quite a<br/>
challenge to get without being detected at other times. The we<br/>
pressed on eastward to the Barlow area and collected some of Safari<br/>
Man's wonderful boxes. He has carved some spectacular stamps that<br/>
lend themselves very well to colored markers and look very good in the<br/>
logbook. We located: "The Big One That Got Away', 'Unusual At a Rest<br/>
Stop', 'Root Covered Bridge', 'Mill Branch Bridge', 'Not Found Wild in<br/>
Ohio', 'Bell Covered Bridge', 'Found Aplenty in Ohio', and<br/>
'Constitution, Ohio' We also collected 'Horsetrader 1' by<br/>
Horsetrader. Great history lessons, beautiful places, and lovely<br/>
stamps - it doesn't get much better than that! We had optimisticly<br/>
printed clues for Belpre and Marietta as well but by late afternoon<br/>
the rain finally started to fall and we retreated home to Jackson. We<br/>
WILL definitely be going back that way in the not-to-distant future.<br/>
There must be another box there somewhere Trailtracker missed. We<br/>
stamped in after her in every box except the Bell Covered Bridge I<br/>
think. Thanks to all the planters for a great day of adventure!<br/>
There's a lot of history and things to see in the Marietta area - some<br/>
of you who are further away than we are might want to consider a<br/>
weekend trip down there. The Sunday brunch at the Lafayette Hotel<br/>
alone is enough to justify the trip!  Happy boxing!<br/>
