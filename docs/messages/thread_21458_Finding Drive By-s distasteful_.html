&gt; <br/>
&gt; From geocaching, I can tell you that the attitude<br/>
&gt; that people who like<br/>
&gt; "drive bys" are "just numbers players" is wrong. I<br/>
&gt; see this attitude<br/>
&gt; all the time, usually from people who would rather<br/>
&gt; spend three weeks<br/>
&gt; hiking in the mountains than do anything else. I am<br/>
&gt; not one of those--<br/>
&gt; the woods and I have traditionally had a slightly<br/>
&gt; antagonistic<br/>
&gt; relationship, and while I enjoy a nice, flat, day<br/>
&gt; hike, you aren't<br/>
&gt; going to see me going off to be rained on, snowed<br/>
&gt; on, or tripped to<br/>
&gt; fall flat on my face for more than a day or so at a<br/>
&gt; time. For some of<br/>
&gt; us, the woods are not a welcoming retreat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are people, like myself, who work 8 hours a<br/>
&gt; day and commute for<br/>
&gt; 2 hours a day. We leave home when the sun is coming<br/>
&gt; up, and sometimes<br/>
&gt; don't return until it is down. Sitting in our<br/>
&gt; cubicles, we do not get<br/>
&gt; to see the sunlight except on weekends. If, during<br/>
&gt; the course of my<br/>
&gt; crappy commute, I have the chance to park my car<br/>
&gt; somewhere other than<br/>
&gt; a gas station, get out, breathe a big gulp of fresh<br/>
&gt; air, and exchange<br/>
&gt; a momentary stamp with a letterbox.... well, I<br/>
&gt; personally would love<br/>
&gt; that. It gives me a little bit of magic in what is<br/>
&gt; sometimes a very<br/>
&gt; drudging lifestyle, and I don't need the hike to do<br/>
&gt; the letterbox. If<br/>
&gt; letterboxing were all about the hike, then there<br/>
&gt; wouldn't be a box at<br/>
&gt; the end and you'd call it hiking, like everyone else<br/>
&gt; out there.<br/>

I would like to address both the driveby and the postal letterbox<br/>
issues here. I, for one, am glad that there are drive by boxes and<br/>
boxes with fairly short walks.  My daughter, Out of Sight, is a blind<br/>
letterboxer and we would not be able to do any boxing together if it<br/>
weren't for boxes like these.  I can't take her into the woods with<br/>
the Hairy Leggers to do the complicated Mapsurfer boxes but she can<br/>
still enjoy figuring out clever clues and finding the simpler boxes<br/>
with me.  <br/>
As far as postal letterboxes go, these are definitely a different<br/>
game.  I am very active on the PLB message board and think I can speak<br/>
with some knowledge on this.  The only thing that a PLB has in common<br/>
with a letterbox is that a stamp and a logbook is involved.  I have<br/>
over 100 finds in regular letterboxes and from my experience, the<br/>
order of importance is location, the hikes, the clues and then the box<br/>
itself for these boxes.  In a PLB, the most important thing is the<br/>
stamp and the logbook.  There are some stamps out there that are<br/>
nothing short of artwork and the logbooks that have arrived in my<br/>
mailbox show a tremendous amount of love and attention to the details.<br/>
In PLBing, the stamp is indeed the reward.<br/>
<br/>
If it is repugnant to you, then you have the freedom to not take part<br/>
in either of these types of letterboxes, that is the beauty of our<br/>
hobby.  Take what you like and leave the rest alone.<br/>

Repugnant is a bad choice of words.  Exploited would be better.  By<br/>
the way, it wasn't meant as a personal attack.    Know what I mean?<br/>
