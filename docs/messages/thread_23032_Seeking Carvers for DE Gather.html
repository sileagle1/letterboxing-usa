IT's JUST a GAME <br/>
Gather Round <br/>
The Game's Afoot<br/>
Play Outside The Box<br/>
All this and more at the First Gather in the First State. <br/>
<br/>
With 50 stamps scheduled for playing the five games, there are still 10 stamps needing carvers in the various categories. Jump over to <br/>
http://de-games.tripod.com<br/>
for all the details. On the STAMPS page where the categories are listed there is also a link to "stamp suggestions" to ignite those imaginations.<br/>
<br/>
The gather set for October 8 at Killens Pond State Park, Felton DE, has been posted to www.AtlasQuest.com<br/>
so if you are looking for a different sort of gather, you'll want to put this one on your calendar.<br/>

I already carved, but let me take a look at the 10 remaining stamps <br/>
needed.  I'll get back to you in a minute.<br/>
