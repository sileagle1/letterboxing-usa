thank you, THANK YOU for your kind words. i have not received much <br/>
(any?!) feedback from other's to gauge the usefulness of this tool. i <br/>
am happy that someone can appreciate the many hours it took to get <br/>
this database functional.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, there is a difference between the two versions. i will try <br/>
and be brief. there is actually a v1.4b that is the latest. sorry i <br/>
can't help myself but i promise it will be the last one for quite a <br/>
while!<br/>
<br/>
i removed the pie charts which did not seem to refresh correctly and <br/>
quite frankly did not provide any useful information except to <br/>
aggravate the programmer. in lieu i added raw number counts on <br/>
the "stats" page which refresh instantly. also, i added a neat little <br/>
counter that will list your PFX counts grouped by state. kewl.<br/>
<br/>
in addition (yes, there is more) a label maker for your PLB's is <br/>
included under the "Postal" tab. i added a print report on your <br/>
Hitchhikers (i have no idea why i did this) and also under <br/>
the "Maintenance" tab you can pull up a detail form of all your <br/>
letterboxes planted. you can also print a report on individual <br/>
letterboxes of interest.<br/>
<br/>
uhm, i think that is it for v1.4b<br/>
feel free to download it and give it a whirl. I'm always open to <br/>
suggestions, kudos or criticism (i prefer kudos).<br/>
<br/>
how to transfer your data. Excellent question. there are many ways to <br/>
do this. probably the easiest is to export your Main log book table <br/>
to Excel. click the "Export to Excel" button on the main form. next, <br/>
open the new version (v1.4b) and open the "Log Book Datasheet" from <br/>
the main menu. there you can paste your Excel data into the new <br/>
database. note: this would be an opportunity to fix any ID# gaps <br/>
before you import the data. remember, the ID# is an autonumber field <br/>
and as such counts records consecutively. good luck. send me an email <br/>
off the newsgroup if i can be of further assistance.<br/>
<br/>
best regards, hexacat<br/>

&gt; Dear Hexacat,  Thank you so much for the letterboxing database.  It <br/>
&gt; is a fun tool to use to count all those finds etc.  Can you tell me <br/>
&gt; the difference between 1.3 and 1.4?  I have been working with 1.3 <br/>
&gt; and wondered what differences you made to 1.4 so I can decide if I <br/>
&gt; want to attempt changing.  Thanks for all your hard work! (ps..How <br/>
&gt; would I change if I wanted to?)<br/>

on the left hand side of the newsgroup screen you will see a menu <br/>
selection. select "Files" and then scroll down the list until you see <br/>
a file folder "Log book" the database and README.TXT will be there <br/>
waiting for you :)<br/>

I'm sorry I haven't given feedback.  I downloaded the past 2 versions, but I can't open them <br/>
up ... yeah, I'm a little stupid (so don't flame me), but did you change it from an excel <br/>
program to MS Access?  I have been using an old version with Excel, but would love to use <br/>
the latest and greatest on my Mac; I don't have Access :(<br/>

thanks for downloading the database. no, i will not flame anybody <br/>
unless it is OT. you are correct, the original was an Excel <br/>
spreadsheet, however, i quickly realized a database would be more <br/>
functional for tracking and maintenance purposes. MS Access seemed to <br/>
be a good option. Sorry, there is not a MAC version available (you <br/>
are not the only person who has asked!). i will look into it though.<br/>
