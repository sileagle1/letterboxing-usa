     My husband and I are kind of new at this wonderful hobby. We started 2/17/02 My husband now has 17 letterbox finds.  He goes out a bit more then me as he is retired and I am not.  My son and husband found a hitch hiker box and took it along with them to another location.  In speaking to another letterbox enthusiast I found out that we should post its discovery and its new location. My question is how and where do we do this.  I do not know the proper place to post this question. Any help with protocol is appreciated.  We have planted our first box and the second is ready to have the clues planted. My husband was waiting until a parking lot is done in the spring.  How does everyone fell about just parking on the road?  It is a road that is not very busy.<br/>
Thanks for any help given in advance please email me at<br/>

 As for thr HH's (hitchhikers) recently a group was<br/>
stated so that the entire audience doesn't see the<br/>
info on HH's. It appears that some folks want to know<br/>
and some don't. Previously we would just indicate on<br/>
the subject line something like -  HH/CT &amp; name, but<br/>
as I said recently a special group was started to post<br/>
this info. Then those who want to track their own HH's<br/>
can do so. On the home page go to Talk List, then List<br/>
archive (3rd from botttom on list, I think), register<br/>
if you haven't, or (sign in), then Groups Home at the<br/>
top right. This should show the groups,(if I did this<br/>
corectly from memory.) There's a group for HH's called<br/>
"travellers", a group for CT postings, and the reg.<br/>
group. After you're in a group you can "join" it. If<br/>
there's an easier way, let me know......<br/>
Hope this was correct info. Enjoy boxing with the warm<br/>
forth coming spring weather.<br/>
Always in the woods,<br/>

name of the box and where you found it to the LBNA.<br/>
Not where you placed it. That will be a surprise for<br/>
the next guy. As for the box where you have to park on<br/>
the side of the road, I do it a lot when going hiking<br/>
as long as you can pull off to the side somewhat off<br/>
the pavement. So a letterbox would be ok too. <br/>
