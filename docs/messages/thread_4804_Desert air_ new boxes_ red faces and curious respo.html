Just returned from our annual desert hiking trip, where windy weather <br/>
and temps in the 70's and 80's (instead of those summer 110's/120's!) <br/>
made for some great sand dune and canyon exploring! We also managed <br/>
to increase the number of letterboxes in Nevada by 200% - by dropping <br/>
off 2 new letterboxes yesterday on our way back to the Las Vegas <br/>
airport!! ( More on that later...)<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, it seems that folks have been pretty busy in other parts <br/>
of the country these past couple of weeks,too! Lots of new boxes have <br/>
come out, as well as a few curious responses to my previous messages, <br/>
including several personal ones from people still wondering just what <br/>
had been going on here in Southern New England last month! I guess I <br/>
still wasn't direct enough about what the real problem around here <br/>
was, and quite a few people got sidetracked, so I'll try one more <br/>
time to explain as clearly as I can.<br/>
<br/>
The only real problem I had recently was with Melissa and Dan's <br/>
attempts to deflect responsibility for the red-tongued hitcher <br/>
kidnapper episode onto OTHER PEOPLE. That whole messy business could <br/>
have been simply written off as a poorly-timed childish prank, had <br/>
those two only had the decency to come clean privately during any of <br/>
the various opportunities that presented themselves in the entire <br/>
preceding month.  However,when in their message to me on Mar.13th, <br/>
they continued to choose to obfuscate and deny the fact that they <br/>
would ever go back to look for hitchers, and then proceeded to <br/>
actually try to pin the blame for the "kidnapping caper" on "new <br/>
boxers"(!),that is when I finally ,as they say, "saw red"!<br/>
<br/>
After all, it just so happened that one of the spots at which a red-<br/>
tongued hitcher kidnapper stamp appeared on Feb.15th was at a <br/>
previously unpublished bonus box site called "COOL DOWN",which only a <br/>
very few people would have had occasion to even know about. J,S + J <br/>
did the whole series impeccably.  V+V (the recent hitcher complainer) <br/>
got to the spot where the bonus clues were on Dec.2nd, but apparently <br/>
didn't follow through on going back to the bonus box later, as we had <br/>
originally thought they would.  That left ONLY D+M, who had <br/>
previously picked up the "Poison Ivy"  hitcher there in August, so <br/>
they would have known that that was a good spot to look for another <br/>
hitcher - this time our "Little Tiny Lighthouse". It was also <br/>
apparently not coincidental that they would revisit other sites known <br/>
to them to be big enough to harbor hitchers, and thereby take several <br/>
other hitchers all on the same day - Feb.15th - even though we had <br/>
repeatedly asked folks to take only one hitcher per trip and leave <br/>
any others they could conceivably find for the next person to enjoy. <br/>
It seems that D+M even took a brand new hitcher called "Traveling <br/>
Valentine" that had been left by James and Amanda only the day before <br/>
at one of our former Kimball Audubon boxes, which were confiscated <br/>
shortly thereafter due at least in part to Melissa's having written <br/>
in her first entry that she had snuck her dog Max in - something the  <br/>
Audubon people really did not appreciate reading about!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to get things back in focus here, the point is not about <br/>
going back to boxes to find hitchers, which is OK in most cases, but <br/>
about lying about doing it and then, most of all, about trying to put <br/>
the blame on others, which is NOT OK, at least not with ME! ( I <br/>
really did begin to feel thigs were getting a bit pathological, <br/>
especially when newcomers were being blamed for something that they <br/>
could not possibly have even known about!) Anyway, that is what <br/>
finally got to me, and made me want to speak out about what I <br/>
consider to be unconscionably deceitful behavior, in comparison to <br/>
which bragging about being first (no matter how redundantly) or <br/>
complaining about hitchers (no matter how obstreperously) seem to be <br/>
only small and palid issues!<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I guess we just have to deal with the fact that there are <br/>
many different types of people: some will be remembered for their <br/>
sweetness and nice comments, others only for their complaints; some <br/>
will be recalled for being open and sharing, others for being <br/>
secretive or dishonest; some known only for writing their PFX counts, <br/>
others for not writing anything at all except for when they are <br/>
first!  And then there will always now be those two, who - whether or <br/>
not they are actually capable of feeling shame - at least in our own <br/>
minds will from now on be inextricably linked with their RED FACES!<br/>
<br/>
Well, let's hope that at least some lessons have been gleaned from <br/>
all this!  Maybe now we can get back to putting out our boxes along <br/>
with a few new ones, and maybe even a hitcher or two for new folks. <br/>
(Don't worry - only hitchers we find; we only had 2 of our own <br/>
anyway, and they are probably both currently "out of circulation",<br/>
seeing as V+V and D+M were the ones to get them!) We also have a bit <br/>
of spring-cleaning to do at some of our Burlingame area box sites, <br/>
like Old North Camp and Cool Down, which were trashed, so please give <br/>
us a week or two to get things back in order.<br/>
<br/>
Here's hoping for a kinder, gentler<br/>
more thoughtful and considerate<br/>
"Springtime of Letterboxing"!<br/>

And to think that just one little tiny bit of honesty back in mid-<br/>
