<br/>
Went out this morning to the DWGNRA to search for the Bench Box Blues <br/>
Letterbox and Mt. Tammany Letterbox.  I was the first finder of the <br/>
Bench Box Blues Letterbox.  Nice spot, thanks Floating Feather.  Then <br/>
I continued up to Mt. Tammany.  This was a truly challenging climb, <br/>
but well worth the effort with the incredible view.  Unfortunately, I <br/>
was unable to locate the box.  I was just wondering if anybody has <br/>
been to this box recently.  I'm fairly certain I was in the right <br/>
spot.<br/>

<br/>
I was there today and couldn't find it either. I even paced it off <br/>
twice and poked around in all the nearby logs. I did find an empty <br/>
ziploc bag under the hollow log I thought was its home, so maybe it's <br/>
gone missing.<br/>
<br/>
Also, some critter did get to the Bench Box Blues box, so it's not in <br/>
great shape though still snug in its home.<br/>
<br/>
I went hiking today because I figured it would be less crowded on the <br/>
trails -- turns out I was only partly right! On my hike up the <br/>
mountain, I came across a rattlesnake, a black rat snake, a turkey <br/>
hen with poults, and a young buck who beat me to the summit of Mt <br/>
Tammany. I also received a warning from some other hikers about a <br/>
bear they had just seen 20 yards behind them, not far off the trail. <br/>
Of course the bear was upwind of where I was headed, so I made plenty <br/>
of noise to make sure it knew I was around.<br/>

<div>We were there on Sunday - Midday, and found the box's contents 
scattered and soaked. We tried to dry things off the best we could and replace 
the box where it belonged. The log book was ruined and ought to be 
replaced.  We also found the two Jenny Jump boxes in good shape as well as 
the Ken Lockwood box. What a wonderful day to hunt boxes! Life is 
great.....</div>
