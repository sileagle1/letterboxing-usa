Here in the PNW we have vintage letterboxes hidden in Hershey's cocoa boxes and <br/>
Gatorade jars and used Tupperware that have been in place, out of doors, in thickly <br/>
wooded areas for 3-7 years. They have never been disturbed. <br/>
<br/>
I have also had boxes that had never touched food chewed by critters. It's my <br/>
current theory that the scent of paper and glue are just as attractive as anything <br/>
else. My current MO is to wash used food containers well with detergent, double <br/>
bag everything and cross my fingers. I probably wouldn't use anything that had <br/>
ever contained what biologists call "the universal bait," peanut butter but I consider <br/>
anything else fair game. Good luck with those Cool Containers, Funhog<br/>

I have used the plastic Skippy containers very successfully. I let <br/>
them soak in detergent for a few weeks, then swab a wetted with <br/>
acetone papertowel on the inside and close it up quickly.I let them <br/>
sit for a few days and before I use them I generally cover the <br/>
outside with duct tape. The duct tape will help keep the UV rays <br/>
from degrading the plastic material that the container is made from. <br/>
We just replaced a Lemonade container that had no duct tape covering <br/>
and it had become very brittle,and split on the top. It had been <br/>
covered in an excess of 4 feet of snow(in July)and it is a <br/>
possibility that the cold and weight of the snow crushed it? Most <br/>
food containers are made so that the sun's rays will help degrade <br/>
them. I'm not sure that it is made on purpose to do that or if it is <br/>
a cost saving feature.We have some peanut butter containers that <br/>
have been out there for over 4 years.<br/>

<br/>
I haven't had any problems with animals, but I do have 5 tins that I <br/>
will pull before the winter as they are metal and I don't want them to <br/>
rust shut.<br/>
<br/>
My own containers have included baby wipes boxes spraypainted with <br/>
plastic paint, mint tins, unusual shaped tins, screw top steel <br/>
cylinders, beading tins, magnetic keyholders, wooden boxes treated with <br/>
tons of coats of varnish, a hollowed out book, a bird house, teenie-<br/>
weenie containers for my "Leprechan's Revenge" series, plastic food <br/>
boxes, animal/pet coffins, lunchboxes, a mini-suitcase, tea boxes, <br/>
index card boxes, recipe card boxes, and by far my favorite and most <br/>
numerous.......Lock n Lock boxes. I just started covering them with <br/>
camo duct tape and they disappear.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the best container I have seen thus far has been the one <br/>
made by Lisa Scenic's boyfriend Robb. He is absolutely evil when it <br/>
comes to camoflage. I'll see if I can post a pic...<br/>

I have one in a hollowed out book in the Andover, MA <br/>
library. The book was provided by the librarians and is in <br/>
the reference section. A simple treasure hunt for the <br/>
clues is required to find it.<br/>

<br/>
I have one in a Tea House - the box only holds the stamp and pad and is <br/>
a jeweled tin - very cool. The Log book looks like a jeweled purse and <br/>
the tin hangs on it.  The Proprietress has them hanging on a hook <br/>
behind the cash register in plain sight - from the clues you have a <br/>
question you have to ask.<br/>
<br/>
I also found two in the Fort Meyers Beach area and they were both in <br/>
lunch boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I like boxes!<br/>

&gt; Just out of curiousity, where do you hide "indoor" boxes?  What <br/>
&gt; types of places?<br/>
<br/>
I have one in a Tea House - the box only holds the stamp and pad and is <br/>
a jeweled tin - very cool. The Log book looks like a jeweled purse and <br/>
the tin hangs on it.  The Proprietress has them hanging on a hook <br/>
behind the cash register in plain sight - from the clues you have a <br/>
question you have to ask.<br/>
<br/>
I also found two in the Fort Meyers Beach area and they were both in <br/>
lunch boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I like boxes!<br/>

Ok, maybe everyone wouldn't think that was fun or cool, but it was a<br/>
