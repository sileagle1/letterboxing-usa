It has come to my attention that many people have skipped the "How to write an intelligent post" class, so I'm going to review some pointers here. Posting--and this is applicable to any chat board, discussion group, talk list, etc--is a simple thing to do, so it's amazing that so many people flunk the basic principles. <br/>
Don't ask stupid questions. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  A common mistake--especially for newbies that are new to a discussion group--is to ask annoyingly stupid questions." <br/>
<br/>
Wow.  You are brutal, Ryan.  Your rough draft is a little too rough, I think.  I take it you want some input on this or you wouldn't have bothered posting the link.  I'm pretty sure that you think you are just being honest and to-the-point, and humorous maybe, but you come off as quite a pompous know-it-all holier-than-thou waaaay-too-sexy-for-my-shirt kinda person.  Yuck.  But hear me out, because I am shooting the message and the delivery, not just the messenger.  ;-)  You seem the kind who can take it.  <br/>
<br/>
Although some of your "guidelines" (read: things that you think are stupid, inane, or otherwise idiotic) have some merit, you are ignoring the fact that the rest of the people in the world aren't all as smart and savvy as you are nor well-versed in what you consider good posting netiquette.  Some people who ask stupid questions do so because they are a stranger in a strange land.  To point out so coldly their inexperience (stupidity) makes this strange land bitterly inhospitable.  <br/>
<br/>
So, do what you suggest people already do and ignore their posts.  That's all.  Contrary to what you assert, although most of us may not be terrifically impressed with other people's kids or family members doing whatever, it's obvious that there are others on the list who are very supportive and very interested.  What makes for "good stuff" for you, as you have listed it, doesn't necessarily do a thing for me.  I wouldn't care about handsome firefighters any more than for the Happy Meal on any given day.  It's all very subjective and personal,  but rather than announce what I think is unnesessary or uninteresting *to me* I would rather let others speak their minds and tell their adventures without feeling the need to let them know whether I truly care or not.  I have my own mental filters.  I have a delete key.  I don't need to be rude.  (But I might be if I think the other person has been rude first.)<br/>
<br/>
I personally would rather the company of kind, "stupid" people, or helpful, patient veterans, than acidic, terse people who feel the need to make others feel small and/or stupid.  <br/>
<br/>
But maybe that's just me.  And maybe you don't realize how bitter and caustic your writing comes across.  Maybe I am reading more acidity than you intended.  If so, I apologize.  I think your guidelines are not really necessary, but if you must post them, could you try to be a little kinder and gentler?  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, also, FWIW, if any reader doesn't  quite get what a particular acronym means, I see no harm in asking, because it could very well be bugging a few others who don't want to ask and appear stupid.  (Although I personally would probably do a web-search if I couldn't figure it out using context clues rather than picture someone snickering at my lack of knowledge and my audacity to ask for clarification.)  Shorthand acronyms, for the most part, are for brevity, not necessarily to make oneself feel smarter.  The longer a person is on the net and exposed to them, the easier they get.<br/>
<br/>
On the positive side, I think your suggestion to lurk and read for a while and to read the FAQs is good.  I don't think it can be said enough.  Someone suggested that this be posted regularly, and I agree.  I belonged to a group for a while that posted a welcome letter with some of your same points, but with a much different tone.<br/>
<br/>
Just my $1.25.  I can appreciate that you would like to inform and educate the newbie or the dense.  I just think there could be better ways to get the points across.  Maybe I'm too easy-going and patient, but I work with children and I'm also sensitive, so it just rubs me wrong the way in which you choose to correct and conform the unindoctrinated general reader and poster.  <br/>
<br/>
Not everyone will agree with me, I'm sure.  Now that your Guidelines are posted by link and I have posted my reaction, feel free to blast away at me if you feel the need.  <br/>

We think Ryan's "rules" are well intentioned and brutally honest.  <br/>

sugar-coating his message??  I mean after all -- he's just said what <br/>

Not everyone uses the Yahoo Groups web interface to read and reply to messages. I know that I use Outlook to receive and read all messages (unless perhaps I'm in-between letterboxes and stop into a public library to search for messages regarding a box that I'm on my way to find) and therefore the reply function only sends messages to the list.<br/>

  Wow do we hear another flame war coming??<br/>
      Nope. You probably don't want a real flame war.  I know I don't.  That's not what this list is for.  But if ever called to the task, I'd whip out my Binford FlameThrow 3000 and have at it.  (arh arh arh!)  I bet I could burn a wicked swath!  But just picture or imagine my post said in the least abbrasive way, maybe like in the manner you'd speak to a co-worker when he has unnecessarily reamed someone who made a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
  Mary at al - <br/>

  Perhaps a quick disclaimer at the top of the page is better than <br/>

      Yes, a "Warning: Highly Toxic" label would be good.   ;-)<br/>

  I mean after all -- he's just said what <br/>
  MANY of us have wanted to! I escpecially like the portion that deals <br/>
  with overly-frequent postings that contain nothing more than "Me <br/>

<br/>
      There probably is a delete key on your computer, too, or some function in Yahoo that lets you skip the "Me, too" posts, if you so choose.<br/>
<br/>
  Hint:   When you click on reply to post - use the drop down Email <br/>
  addresses to reply to the poster and not the entire list...<br/>
<br/>
      Ah, but I use Outlook Express and the default reply is to the list.  One has to do a little more work to find the "mail to:" address under properties. But honestly, I was being open and purposely answered in the public forum.  The last paragraph should make that clear.<br/>
      I appreciate that others (MANY?) could agree with Ryan's "guidelines" but I would ask why all those many others would not post such a thing here?  And I would think that the true answer is that most people are considerate of other people's feelings and probably don't want to appear like a wise-aker or bully.  Ryan brought up good points.  I think I made it clear that it was more the tone of his writing with which I took issue.  <br/>

Wow, in just a few short weeks we have gone from a hobby with<br/>
"no rules" to one with strict "guidelines".  Rather than risk<br/>
being shamed by the Letterbox Police, maybe we should send<br/>
all posts to Ryan so he can approve them before they go to <br/>
the group. :)<br/>

&gt;Date: Sun, 24 Aug 2003 11:36:02 -0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wow do we hear another flame war coming??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Mary at al -<br/>
&gt;We think Ryan's "rules" are well intentioned and brutally honest.<br/>
&gt;Perhaps a quick disclaimer at the top of the page is better than<br/>
&gt;sugar-coating his message??  I mean after all -- he's just said what<br/>
&gt;MANY of us have wanted to! I escpecially like the portion that deals<br/>
&gt;with overly-frequent postings that contain nothing more than "Me<br/>
&gt;Too".<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hint:   When you click on reply to post - use the drop down Email<br/>
&gt;addresses to reply to the poster and not the entire list...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-Steve, Heidi , &amp; Madras<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm confused...since the "guidelines" were posted for all to <br/>
review...does that mean that we should only direct our comments to the <br/>
poster...or should we be given the privilege of allowing all to see the <br/>
reaction to the "guidelines"<br/>

his notes on hiking the trail.  I'm doing it vicariously through him since I<br/>
won't ever be able to myself (at this point, that is).  I thoroughly enjoy<br/>
each of his posts.  Yes, some of them are strongly worded and of strong<br/>
opinions, but there is no need to come back and attack him personally.  That<br/>
comes of sounding more mean spirited than the post that people are writing<br/>
about in the first place, especially when some of the comments are made in a<br/>
tongue-in-cheek manner (ex. anti-sitrep organizations).<br/>

We have the right to disagree and to say so, but it doesn't help anything<br/>

well, things I can't say on this board since it's public.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, the guidelines are meant to be just that--guidelines.  They <br/>
are not meant to be rules, although I think it would be nice if many <br/>
of them were.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I did not write these guidelines out of my own frustration or <br/>
annoyance with the boards--I've rarely been able to get on them since <br/>
I started hiking the Appalachian Trail.  But I know more than one <br/>
person on the board has been frustrated by "bad posts", and I took it <br/>
upon myself to attempt to make the world a better place with <br/>
education of posting etiquette.<br/>
<br/>
The tone is harsh--that's meant more to sound like one is in boot <br/>
camp--sort of an amuzing way to tackle the issue, although apparently <br/>
some people think it's more serious than it was really meant to <br/>
sound.  But still, there are right and wrong ways to make a post, but <br/>
unless somebody comes out with the cold, harsh truth, how will anyone <br/>
learn them?<br/>
<br/>
I could sugar coat the information and write in such a manner like <br/>
one might talk to a two-year old, but then I'd be flamed by everyone <br/>
saying I was treating them like a baby.  It would also blunt the case <br/>
that while there is a certain level of subjectivity that makes up a <br/>
good post, there's also very measurable, quantifyable points that <br/>
make a good post (or a bad post, if that be the case).  And people <br/>
would continue posting bad posts under the protective flag of "well, <br/>
that doesn't apply to ME--it's subjective!"<br/>
<br/>
I'm sick of political correctness gone wild, so I wrote a page on <br/>
posting etiquette that was direct and brutally honest.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not perfect, but I *am* an experienced poster--both on this board <br/>
and many, many others.  I've seen countless examples of great posts <br/>
and bad ones.  For those who are not so experienced, rather than <br/>
figure it out for themselves, I'm providing a service--and that's <br/>
exactly how I think of it, a service for others--so they can learn <br/>
from my own mistakes and experience.  If they choose not to, I don't <br/>
really care.  It'll only hurt their reputation, not mine, by <br/>
continuing to post bad posts.  (Yes, I am aware that I do not have a <br/>
universal reputation as a "wonderful" person, but that's not because <br/>
of writing bad posts, but rather controversial ones.  I've never been <br/>
afraid to share my brutally honest opinions!)<br/>
<br/>
I will be making updates to my webpage based on the feedback I've <br/>
gotten (heaven knows when given my limited Internet access, but it <br/>
WILL happen).  I'll probably try to tone down the tone a bit, but I <br/>
fear it will never be sugar-coated enough for some people.<br/>
<br/>
And again, if you want to insure I read your replies, you must e-mail <br/>
me directly.  I might read them if you post to the board, but it'll <br/>
be a hit-and-miss kind of thing.<br/>
