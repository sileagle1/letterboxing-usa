Cemetary Boxes in Hartford.  All have had many visitors, and the<br/>
cemetary was beautiful!  I was happy to find "The World's Buzziest<br/>
Hitchhiker" buzzing around box #3, Samuel Colt.  After finishing at the<br/>
cemetary, I made my way over to Charter Oak landing to find the "Sharp<br/>
Dressed Man," and then to Reservoir #6, to find the "Impatient Cow"<br/>
(MOO!:) and "One Cool Cat," which have all also seen many visitors.<br/>
Maybe I'll have to play hookey from work sometime this week to find that<br/>
HH a new home...<br/>
