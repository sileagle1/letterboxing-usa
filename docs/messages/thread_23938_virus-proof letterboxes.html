Hi to all in LB land, .......Was curious to know about where this virus<br/>
is  spreading to and which states this LB virus has hit.<br/>
<br/>
	 One way to keep the boxes safe is to make it very difficult for the<br/>
virus to spread to one , like putting it high in a tree, or more<br/>
practically, putting it on the top of a high mountain. Certainly , easy<br/>
LB's will be susceptible to these kinds of attacks. Virus carriers just<br/>
won't penetrate these unfriendly places of being. (along with many<br/>
"normal" lber's) More than two of ours are too far "out of the way"  to<br/>
be hit by a virus like this. No virus would ever be caught alive at <br/>
these heights, and so they are protected.    ...........   Peace &amp; Love  <br/>
.............  budster of the Catskills<br/>

What's that? Innocent letterboxers being stained blue? Hey, they knew what<br/>
they were getting into when they read the waiver.<br/>

As long as letterboxers are satisfied with the status quo in posting<br/>
their clues online, their boxes will be vulnerable to these sort of<br/>
attacks. Letterboxing infrastructure as we know it should be usurped<br/>
by the underground massive.<br/>
