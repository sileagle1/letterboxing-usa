time boxer...pack up the grankids, head to where the box should be and <br/>
we came back empty handed and disappointed...until we realized that it <br/>
was time spent together and that every time out is an adventure in <br/>
which there is no telling what will happen. After two and a half years <br/>
we are still in it and we still love our adventures. Welcome!<br/>
