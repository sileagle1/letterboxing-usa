                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was recently asked by a friend to speak to his wife's<br/>
Girl Scout Troop about letterboxing, which she had<br/>
just read about.  I agreed and we met this past weekend.<br/>
I told them all about the joys of letterboxing and showed<br/>
them my limited skills at carving.  For now, they picked<br/>
store-bought stamps for their personal stamps, but I helped<br/>
them think of letterbox names for themselves.  I Then watched<br/>
as they followed my clues to the Sugar Land letterbox in Oyster<br/>
Creek Park.  They seemed to enjoy themselves and are even<br/>
thinking about placing a box of their own.  It was a rewarding<br/>
experience for me (not only because I doubled my eXchange count)<br/>
and I highly recommend it if you get a chance!<br/>
