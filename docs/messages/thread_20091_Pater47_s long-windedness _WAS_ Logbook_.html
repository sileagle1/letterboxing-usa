Yes, Pater47 is long-winded but oh-so-entertaining when he notifies <br/>
you of a find.  With his permission, I'd be happy to repost his <br/>
narrative.<br/>
<br/>
For what it's worth, I'm more eager to plant more boxes in the area <br/>
Pater47 hunts in (not my home state) because he actually responds <br/>
and is entertaining to boot.  More are coming, I promise.<br/>

&gt; In my limited letterboxing career (just 4 so far), only one stamp <br/>

which <br/>
&gt; is a standard book-sized journal, it could hold several stamps to <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; page, but I've been putting one stamp to a page and then writing <br/>
&gt; about my adventure. This in itself can be a couple of pages. I <br/>
tend <br/>

their <br/>
