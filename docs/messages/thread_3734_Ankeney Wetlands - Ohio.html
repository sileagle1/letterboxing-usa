<br/>
Location:  Near Beavercreek, Greene County, Ohio<br/>
<br/>
Challenge: 2 (.5 miles round trip)<br/>

Date:  16 November 2001   Number 5<br/>
(Note to webmaster: This is not a hybrid cache/letterbox, it is just <br/>
a letterbox.)<br/>
<br/>
East of Beavercreek on Dayton Xenia Road is a small fishing park <br/>
named after a local family who did well in the sand and gravel <br/>
business.  Parking near the picnic shelter, one can walk down a <br/>
grassy hill to a trail into the Ankeney Wetlands.  Not many locals <br/>
know of this park.  Have fun exploring it.  <br/>
<br/>
The trail was built as an Eagle Scout project by a member of Local <br/>
troop 71 and is noted as such in a hand made sign mounted at the <br/>
beginning of the trail.  Walk ahead into the wetlands and toward the <br/>
sound of a babbling brook.  <br/>
<br/>
At the division of the trail, take the right branch where there is a <br/>
post labeled as #1.  As a pace check, it is 90 of my paces to post #2 <br/>
on the trail.   Pass Post #2 and continue through the wetlands.  A <br/>
pair of binoculars would be helpful in observing the many marsh birds <br/>
present.  On the November day that I discovered this park, quail were <br/>
everywhere.  <br/>
<br/>
Eventually, the trail mounts a levee where there is a sign noting the <br/>
care that Pack 85 of the Cub Scouts is taking care of an area around <br/>
a very secluded pond where I need to return in the spring to fish.   <br/>
This warm November evening I heard fish feeding on the surface.  What <br/>
kind of crazy fish have come up from their winter hiding to cavort <br/>
like it is spring??  <br/>
<br/>
After you walk the length of the levee, the trail (and you) turn left <br/>
and descend a muddy few yards.  From the bottom of the levee until it <br/>
emerges in the sunlight along the Ankeney Wetlands is 125 paces.  25 <br/>
paces after entering the woods again, you come across a tree blown <br/>
down by the wind.  The tree forms a bridge over the path.  There are <br/>
beautiful bracket fungi growing on the wind blown debris.  <br/>
<br/>
Plunging into the undergrowth on the right side of the path at this <br/>
point, 10 paces brings you to a standing hulk of a dead shagbark <br/>
hickory tree.  On the far side of the base of this tree, under some <br/>
of the bark and a large rock, you will find the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
There are no geocaching goodies at this box, just a stamp, pad, and a <br/>
logbook.  There may be clues to other boxes contained in the log <br/>
entries.<br/>
