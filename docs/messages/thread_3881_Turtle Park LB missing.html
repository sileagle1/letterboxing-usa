 Today(8/10/01), my kids and I tried to find the Turtle Park LB in ST. Louis,<br/>
 MO.  We looked in all the places that we felt were possible for it to be and<br/>
 it was not there.  It is a very small park in the city, crowded and<br/>
 maintatined by the city.  We had people asking what we were looking for...it<br/>
 just was not possible to be looking and be discrete.  I believe the box is<br/>
 gone.  Sorry.<br/>

HI Rosewood,  we visited the park at the end of August and the box was still <br/>
there!!!  Have you been there since 8/10/01?<br/>
<br/>
We will check it out next time we are in the city.  :o)<br/>

Mohmers and kids!<br/>
