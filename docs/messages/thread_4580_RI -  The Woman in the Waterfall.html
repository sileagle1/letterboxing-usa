the header in...<br/>
<br/>
This is a new box.<br/>
<br/>
 Last summer, Betz and I planted this box.  We didn't<br/>
publish the clues,though, because the waterfall *had<br/>
been turned off*!  There is a dam repair project going<br/>
on and some gate had been closed so that you could<br/>
actually walk on the bottom of Barden Reservoir. :-(<br/>
<br/>
We revisited the box last night, and it had had 2<br/>
visitors. (One a friend who had the clues, and an<br/>
accidental finding. Now the water level is up to the<br/>
top of the dam but, apparently due to drought<br/>
conditions, the waterfall is not too swift.<br/>
<br/>
 The clues may need some corrections with little<br/>
details on the site. Here is the link:<br/>

<br/>
 Let us know if the clues need revisions/corrections.<br/>
