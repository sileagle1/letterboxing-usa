nice too!  Oh well. I thought you might enjoy the prose anyway.  The <br/>
location is a semi rural hillside with 3 graves.   <br/>
<br/>
Do other members of the group have letterbox locations they worked up <br/>
and then decided at the last moment not to use?<br/>
<br/>
Here goes:<br/>
<br/>
Name: RIP - Martin Borger - 1828<br/>
<br/>
Beavercreek, Greene County, Ohio<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty 2<br/>
<br/>
NOT Placed 23 November 2001<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The agricultural world of newly settled Greene County in the early <br/>
19th century is now difficult to imagine.  Most of the countryside <br/>
was still covered with old growth timber.  The memory of Shawnee <br/>
Indians just over the hill at Old Town was still fresh on the minds <br/>
of living men and women.  <br/>
<br/>
Luxury was having a real glass pane for a window in the log cabin.  <br/>
Work was hard and life was short.  Heat came from a fireplace that <br/>
was never satisfied for wood in the cold and dark winter nights.  <br/>
Children were born without much help from neighbors and certainly <br/>
none from doctors.  <br/>
<br/>
For this walk, park in the gravel pull-off at the west end of XXXXX.  <br/>
Cross the road walking west.  Follow the grassy seasonal road along <br/>
the creek at a heading of about 340 degrees until you cross the <br/>
culvert.  <br/>
<br/>
Turn to 230 degrees and walk 100 paces along the edge of the field to <br/>
a pile of large stones.  Take a new heading  of  286 degrees and walk <br/>
200 paces to the top of the hill.  <br/>
<br/>
Rest in Peace, Martin Borger.  The historical society has been out <br/>
writing mystical runes on small tags in a foreign tongue.  The tags <br/>
are near the tombstones.  Stop a moment and think about all the times <br/>
this small family of gravestones has seen over the last 175 years.  <br/>
<br/>
The path and gravestones are on private property. It belongs to XXX <br/>
across the street.  I do not believe anyone would mind a few <br/>
wanderers paying their respects at this cemetery. [but I was out <br/>
voted] I have come here occasionally to think on the meaning of the <br/>
shortness of life.   <br/>
<br/>
On the way back to the car, think about the shortness of life and the <br/>
goodness of doing things with your family that will matter in the <br/>
long run.<br/>
