Near Beavercreek, Greene County Ohio<br/>
Difficulty 2 (2.5 mile round trip)<br/>
Placed 25 November 2001<br/>
<br/>
If you enjoyed the Narrows Geocache/letterbox and want more exercise <br/>
in this beautiful park, then have a go at the Footprints Letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
Park at the Narrows lot where Indian Ripple Road and Factory Road <br/>
intersect in Beavercreek.  From there take the River Trail SW along <br/>
the river for 1.25 miles.  You will pass the Buena Vista Trail and <br/>
both entrances of the Cold Springs Trail.  Just past the creek you <br/>
need to cross on stepping stones, angle west to an open meadow with <br/>
picnic tables.  <br/>
<br/>
Take the path directly west through the meadow with the large <br/>
birdhouse on your left.  At the tree line jog right and then left <br/>
onto the Big Woods Trail.  This mature forest is the site of sugar <br/>
maple activities in February and March.  If you are there at this <br/>
time, it is a short walk to where volunteers are reducing the sap <br/>
into sugar.  <br/>
<br/>
Count the wooden steps.  On the 14th step is a note honoring Eagle JS <br/>
Fiore, BSA.  From that step take a course of 220 degrees for 60 paces <br/>
(2 steps = 1 pace here).  Pass one large stump and stop at the <br/>
second.  The letterbox is in the heart of that stump under a rock.  <br/>
