<br/>
I checked on the Rood Bridge Park letterbox today and the box is in <br/>
the location where it is supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
Since this is a new park, I did notice they are changing some of the <br/>
landscape which includes blocking some old trails with branches, <br/>
etc... to reroute traffic.<br/>
<br/>
However, we didn't place the clues right off any beaten paths so you <br/>
may have to figure out how to move through or around objects if they <br/>
are in the direction you are supposed to be heading.  But that's part <br/>
of the fun of letterboxing, making adjustments for obstacles in that <br/>
are possibly in your way when trying to find clues.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to wait a bit until some of this hard rain lets off, <br/>
as several of the trail sections are under huge puddles and <br/>
everything is quite wet.  On the other hand, traffic through the park <br/>
was a minimum.  I saw only 3 others when I was there today.<br/>
<br/>
Better luck next search.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Well, i made an attempt on this bustery day to go and find the rood<br/>
&gt; bridge park letterbox in Hillsboro Oregon. I found bot the first and<br/>
&gt; second clue, but cant seem to find the actual letterbox.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Has anyone else actually found this one and if so, is it in a place<br/>
&gt; where high water or some such could impede its retrival?<br/>
