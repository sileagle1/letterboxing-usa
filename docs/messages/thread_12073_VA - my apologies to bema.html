the log book at "The Woods", so we just assumed it you guys (o.k. now the<br/>
lecture on never assume anything)...so whoever we were following that day<br/>
must not have stamped in.  OOOOOH, another mystery, who WAS it?  They didn't<br/>
have a compass just the directions.  You can easily recognize us because we<br/>
have a compass with a green lanyard string around one of our necks, a bright<br/>
blue backpack (with everything 5 people need including the kitchen sink) and<br/>
directions in hand :-); we're working on our blending in with nature skills.<br/>
<br/>
The gathering sounds like fun, will need to check hubbys schedule too.<br/>
