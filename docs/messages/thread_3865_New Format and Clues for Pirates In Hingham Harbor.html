<p><b><span>Caution: </span></b><span>Busy boat traffic, especially on weekends, including 
high-speed ferry from Hingham.<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>
<p><span></span> </p>
<p><span><strong>Driving 
Directions:</strong> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Launch Site: Hingham Harbor 
Park.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Take exit 14 (Route 228) off Route 3. 
Follow Route 228 to the intersection with Route 3A (6.7 miles). Follow Route 3A 
north to the Hingham Rotary (1.5 miles). Continue around the rotary and find 
Hingham Harbor Park on the right, just before Hinghams bathing 
beach.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Letterbox 
Clues:<o:p></o:p></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Starting from the boat ramp, paddle 
north, passing tiny Button Island, to the first of your quest 
sites.</span></p>
<p><span></span> </p>
<p><i><span>Sarah Island</span></i><span>. On the northeast side of the island there is a 
small point with a solitary good-sized Oak growing there. Beach your vessel, and 
proceed to the oak. Starting in front of the tree facing the water, step off 8 
paces on a heading of 95<sup>O</sup>. The <i>Sarah Island Letterbox</i> lies 
here covered by many stones. After you have stamped in, be sure to cover the box 
with all those stones (add on if you so desire). The more stones, the less 
chance it will float away. Now, return to your vessel and navigate your way to 
<i>Ragged Island</i> to the west.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On the west side of <i>Ragged Island</i> 
are many small rocky inlets and stony beaches. Make your landing in any one of 
these. Then climb over the rocky points to the south shore. Continue along the 
south shore until you spy a dead tree growing out of the rocky ledge. From this 
tree, climb to the top of the rocky bluff. Meander around a bit until you can 
see a small red brick house to the south, a boat house at the end of a point of 
land to the north, and a yellow house to the west. From this spot, bushwhack 
along a general heading of 100<sup>O</sup> until you find a multi-pronged dead 
stump sprouting from the rock. The <i>Ragged Island Letterbox</i> hides beneath 
a ledge near this stump. It is concealed with leaves and grass. Stamp in, 
carefully rehide the box, and return to your 
vessel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Cast off once again, and make your way 
to <i>Langlee Island</i> (located due north of <i>Sarah Island</i>). On the 
southeast shore of the island you will find a small stony beach. Beach your 
craft here, and locate a small path on the left side of the beach (facing the 
island). Follow this path, quickly reaching a fork where you should bear right. 
Now you will come to a large oak tree in the middle of a clearing. Cross the 
clearing, and continue up the rocks. Just as you reach the edge of the overlook, 
look to the left where you will see a split rock. The <i>Langlee Island 
Letterbox</i> is hidden here. Do not reach into hidden spaces without checking 
them out first. Find the box, and take it to the top of the overlook for 
stamping in. This may be a good spot for a picnic. When replacing the box, 
beware prying eyes; this appears to be a popular 
place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>You have now captured the Pirates of 
Hingham Harbor. If you are still game, you might want to paddle to the northern 
most art of Worlds End, where another treasure lies in 
wait.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
