We are looking for Frankenstein on the Loose HH by The Chichlid Guy and Monster Mash Traveler by Steve, Heidi and Madras. These two were only to travel to Monster Mash boxes. All the boxes have been picked up and they are not in any of the retrieved boxes. As a matter of fact, only 2 HH were in all the boxes which is disappointing as we hoped to send some HH back to the monster makers. Anyone having any information about these two hitchhikers please contact me off list. To have this month of monster hunting end successfully, we need to return these to the monster makers.......Chuck and Molly<br/>
