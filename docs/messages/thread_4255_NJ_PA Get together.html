Raubsville Inn or the Ship Inn sounds great, I think Raubsville might have <br/>
more room for moving around, as in exchanging stamps and meeting new folks! <br/>
Food and service is good, bar is separate from the dining area.<br/>
Boxes galore for those who have not been over that way.There's "Fish In <br/>
Outer Space" in Allentown, PA. "Stone Faces of Haycock Mt.", and Ralph <br/>
Stover State Park with " High Rocks" and "Winter Night, Full Moon"  less <br/>
than half an hour away. "Ringing Rocks" is 15 minutes down river with 2 <br/>
boxes and there is a series of 7 letterboxes on the Deleware River from <br/>
Tinicum PA. to Easton Pa.,and another 3 along the Lehigh River/Canal near <br/>
and in Bethehem, Pa.<br/>
"Winahawcawchunk" and "Bowman's Hill" are a bit further down river from <br/>
Tinicum at Washington's Crossing. Tons more on top of those...<br/>
Then there are all those Jersey boxes! Wow! So many boxes, so little time!! <br/>
LOL!!<br/>
Hope to meet old friends and those, "know your stamp but not your face" <br/>
folks real soon.<br/>
Who is the black bird and black bat?????<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy Life!! 'Box On!!<br/>
<br/>
See Joy<br/>

<div>Hi Guys</div>
<div>    I think my suggestion of the Weisel Youth 
Hostel at Lake Nockamixon park didn't get posted to the list. The facility can 
house 20, and I think there is a common room that can take even more folks than 
that. It is available for the use of residents of Bucks county (several of 
us meet that criteria). My concern about a restaurant is that we may 
take up too much room in a restaurant for too long and prevent other diners from 
getting seated. </div>

<div>What do you think?</div>
