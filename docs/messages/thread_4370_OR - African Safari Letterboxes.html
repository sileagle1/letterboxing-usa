<br/>
It's certainly been a great few days for hunting big game in the<br/>
Columbia River Gorge!!!  John and I were able to capture three together<br/>
and he did Eagle Creek yesterday while I was at an all day class.  <br/>
<br/>
Ryan, I cannot thank you enough for placing this marvelous series.  John<br/>
has nearly all of your beautiful animal carvings and I'm feeling about<br/>
ambitious and fit enough to aspire towards getting them all eventually<br/>
-- Yes...Even Pt. Defiance and, UGH, Nesmith Point.  After nabbing two<br/>
exotic creatures in the Gorge today we attempted Multnomah Falls again.<br/>
However, it continues to perplex and elude.  We couldn't do Angel's Rest<br/>
because by the time we got there, it would have been dark coming down.<br/>
Just another safari to look forward to in the future!<br/>
<br/>
PS  It looks like there are some very, very active folks in Ohio placing<br/>
boxes right and left.  That's one state I've never been to, but I can<br/>
see that there is plenty of incentive to go there one of these days.<br/>
Even if some of them are geocache/Letterbox combos, I might be willing<br/>
to seek them out, anyway, as long as a GPS is not required.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
