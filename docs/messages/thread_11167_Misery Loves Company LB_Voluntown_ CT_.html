                    <div class="plaintext-content">We visited the CTDEP letterbox at Pauchaug Forest today, and decided <br/>
to try for Misery Loves Company, since they were so close.  <br/>
Unfortunately, the box was all but destroyed.  The top was broken <br/>
off, it was filled with water and frozen.  We took it home to thaw it <br/>
out and see if we could repair it.  Eveything but the stamp and <br/>
weather-proof notebook were completely destroyed.  Even the stamp is <br/>
very worn and no longer looks like the image printed on it.  We're <br/>
trying to dry the logbook- it was a weatherproof notebook from EMS, <br/>
so by the way, they apparently are actually weatherproof!  We're <br/>
trying to find the owner of this box to see what he/she would like us <br/>
to do with it.  We don't mind taking care of it, but don't want to <br/>
take over someone's box.  If anyone in the lb community has any info, <br/>
please post or email us directly. Thank you!<br/>
