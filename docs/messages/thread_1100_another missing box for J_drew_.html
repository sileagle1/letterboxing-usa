Very sad news. You have more boxes gone missing than any of the rest <br/>
of us have placed!<br/>
<br/>
It's hard to know how we should handle this. I would recommend just <br/>
having the author put a note on his or her own page that the box is <br/>
currently missing (which will often be a temproary situation) and <br/>
leave the clue (and the count) in place.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>

<br/>
-River Walk, Lyme CT, temporarily removed by us<br/>
-Seven Falls #3, Hadlyme CT, removed by well meaning hikers<br/>
-Connecticut Yankee, Essex CT, missing<br/>
-Meadow Woods, Essex CT, missing<br/>
-Quiet Corner #3, Northeast CT, vandalized<br/>
-Little Dam, Ledyard CT, vandalized<br/>
-Under the Mountain,  tampered but still there<br/>
-Wickaboxet #2, Exeter RI, vandalized<br/>
-Fort Wetherill, Jamestown RI, missing but soon to be replaced with <br/>
help from our friends<br/>
-Old Bridge, Jamestown RI, isolated by new barrier gates if not <br/>
missing anyway<br/>
-Fort Adams, Newport RI, replaced by friends with new stamp(thanks!)<br/>
-Land Sailing, Newport RI, vandalized<br/>
-Fast Passage #3, Newport RI, stolen/abandoned<br/>
-Cherry Blossoms, Washington DC, removed/rescued and to be replaced<br/>
-Traprock House #1, Holyoke MA, missing<br/>
<br/>
And these letterboxes have all previously been vandalized and are now <br/>
replaced with new clues in new spots:<br/>
-Resolution #3, East Lyme CT<br/>
-Ground Zero #1, Waterford CT (tempting fate back in same place)<br/>
-Barking Eagle, Waterford CT (change in a bad compass bearing)<br/>
-Purgatory Point #1, Newport RI<br/>
-Bay of Bristol #1, Bristol RI<br/>
-Ninigret Pond #2, Charlestown RI<br/>
-Pleasant Valley #1, Lyme CT<br/>
-Selden Creek #1, Lyme CT<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows of any others, please let us know...Randy has told us <br/>
numerous times that we need to get our letterboxes into better hiding <br/>
places: more isolated, farther off-trail, better disguised. I've got <br/>
to agree with him on that one, although I'm saddened to hear that his <br/>
first terrific letterbox at Valley Forge is also "gone missing."<br/>

&gt; <br/>
Tom, yeah, I agree. I remember once someone "erased" their Found <br/>
numbers after they lost their personal stamp-journal. We just <br/>
count 'em as we go. We don't count a box twice when we <br/>
replace/recarve and we don't subtract if we abandon one. 'Course we <br/>
haven't kept up with putting notes about the missing ones on our clue <br/>
pages either, partly because we had never sat down and added them up <br/>
like that, partly out of laziness.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This weekend Dan and I set out for some steeper hikes in preparation for our<br/>
hike up Mt. Washington next weekend.  Saturday we headed up the short, but<br/>
steep, Totoket's Ridge in Guilford.  Awesome view from the top and the<br/>
intensely steep begining got the blood pumping.  The box was still there and<br/>
in great condition.  Although the stones covering it nearly went flying over<br/>
the cliff when I moved them!<br/>
Today we headed to the Sleeping Giant for a longer hike.  We trudged up his<br/>
scalped head to the views and box at the chin.  Up and down the hills and<br/>
ridges we went, much of the time in the rain that got heavier throughout the<br/>
day.  I think the Giant thought we were getting fresh with him on the knob,<br/>
because the tree guarding the box gave me a hard smack in the face on the<br/>
way out!!  Well, we ended up finding 5 out of 6.  We are pretty positive<br/>
that we had the right spot for the Tower box because of the rocks we found,<br/>
but no sign of the 6th box anywhere.  The tower did provide a great shelter<br/>
for a while before we headed out into the heavy showers to make our way down<br/>
the giant.  Thanks for two great hikes.  Sorry to have to report another<br/>
missing box.<br/>

<div>I just returned from the Sleeping Giant. I am sad 
to say I think the tower box has gone missing. There are a pile of stones where 
I think the box once lived. btw did you know that this precipice is apparently a
