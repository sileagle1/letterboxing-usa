pack, I thought this a great bargain!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Big Lots is my chief supplier for letterboxing materials!!!  (Coming <br/>
in at a close 2nd are thrift shops with ample supplies of neat <br/>
tupperware/rubbermade containers.)  <br/>
<br/>
At Big Lots, I found these tiny plastic boxes (2"x2"x1") in pastel <br/>
colors (6 for $0.99) and they are perfect for 'micro-letterboxes'.  <br/>
Buy a pack of their memo-notebooks (5x$0.99) and a pack of their <br/>
neon erasers/pencil sharpener sets (6x$0.99) and you're ready.  I <br/>
simply cut the memo-notebooks in half (at least the ones that are <br/>
bound with a spiral spine on the side as opposed to the top)--cut <br/>
the paper pages with regular scissors and cut the wire spine with <br/>
pliers.  Bend the cut wire under the remaining wire spine so it <br/>
doesn't catch on the pages (or the letterbox locator) and you're <br/>
ready.  I find old pencils (golf pencils or large ones I cut in <br/>
half), place those with one of those pencil sharpeners you got in <br/>
the pack of erasers in the box along side of a pen refill you've <br/>
stripped from any old cheap pen and it bends enough so you can close <br/>
the lid with the notebook, stamp, pen (guts), pencil, sharpener and <br/>
small letterboxing info pads.  Put your things in snack size zipper <br/>
topped plastic bags and it fits nicely within the box.  You can wrap <br/>
a rubberband around the box to ensure it stays closed, but as of yet <br/>
I haven't experienced any problems with these smaller boxes.  PLUS--<br/>
they're much EASIER to find hiding spots for!!!  :)<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps you with ideas for box materials.  See you on the <br/>
trail...<br/>
