(Montana de Oro, California)<br/>
<br/>
Placed by MCJONES on Sept 29, 2002 at Montana de Oro on the Bluff <br/>
Walk,<br/>
(San Luis Obispo County). Easy, slight incline hike, (NO dogs, Yes <br/>
children). <br/>

WHAT IS a BIMMER OH-2' In 1971, Road &amp; Track chose it best in class <br/>
in their roundup of the world's best cars. It was joined that year <br/>
by the better-handling (thanks to wider wheels, bigger tires and <br/>
better brakes), fuel-injected 2002tii model (the second i was for <br/>
injection) We love our funny car and they are still used for racing! <br/>
<br/>
Directions<br/>
Take your vintage BMW or buy one and drive past Spooner's Cove and <br/>
the Visitor's Center to the end of the road, there is parking and a <br/>
restroom. Take the wide single track trial to the water and not the <br/>
marked COON trail inland. When you reach the water turn left and go <br/>
to the fence with many warnings.  At the base of the third large <br/>
wooden fence pole from the water, there is BMW 02' under some dead <br/>
grass.  There is foot a path you will not trample any fragile <br/>
anything.  There is Poison Oak along the trail but not anywhere near <br/>
the box. There is one lonely prickly cactus on your side of the <br/>
fence but it is not close to the fence.  Be discrete, most folks <br/>
go `right' at the ocean but as this is the perimeter of a nuclear <br/>
power plant and granted authorities may be nervous.<br/>
