<br/>
Checked on this boxes late yesterday.  Even though I didn't hit the<br/>
trail 'til 5 pm, it was still nice and HOT, but as the sun sank behind<br/>
the peak it got pretty comfortable.  Didn't see a human for 2 hours;<br/>
lots of birds though: A hummingbird scared me half to death (Popped out<br/>
of nowhere and was humming about 2 feet from my ear... it really<br/>
startled me), but it was a beautiful evening.  <br/>
<br/>
The box is in good shape; exactly as I left it back in March.  As a<br/>
matter of fact, no one has touched it since.  I'm sure someone will get<br/>
to hit this year.<br/>
