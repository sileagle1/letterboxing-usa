game in Lyme this Saturday. We decided to go out to Bluff Point and <br/>
try to find Elaine &amp; Jerry's and the 6 boxes in the Sound View <br/>
Series. We managed to find E &amp; J's and the first 3 in the series, but <br/>
it was starting to get late and the boy did have to get ready for his <br/>
first ever school dance tonight, which is where he is now. He's a 6th <br/>
grader and my daughter, Katie is a 4th grader. Since we discovered <br/>
letterboxing from a Norwich Bulletin article back in the spring, <br/>
we've become avid fans. We planted our first one a couple of months <br/>
ago at the Bartlett Brook Wildlife Mgmt Area. The 4 letterboxes we <br/>
found today put us at P1F25. We've found 25 letterboxes since June. <br/>
Our goal is to find every one the Drew's plant. Not likely, but a <br/>
worthy goal nonetheless. <br/>
<br/>
I met Eric at EMS with my kids a while back and have corresponded <br/>
with Jay Drew and Tom Cooch (the best letterbox ever is Thunder Hole <br/>
in Maine) and I like the list. A great rest of the weekend to you all.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's always a fine day to letterbox!  When reading your post it occurred<br/>
to me that we are finally realizing one of the initial visions- family<br/>
letterboxing.  Recent posts suggest there are a wealth of 8-15 year olds<br/>
out there.  I do hope we can have a rambunctious Fall gathering with<br/>
plenty of kids.   We can contribute a nine year old (4th grade).<br/>
