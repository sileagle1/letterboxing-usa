                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went to check on one of my letterboxes last week and was pleased to<br/>
find more visitors!  While my little family and I haven't been big<br/>
letterboxers by any means, we're very proud of the 3 boxes we have<br/>
placed over the years.<br/>
<br/>
By the recent comments left in the box's book (placed in 1999), I've<br/>
noticed a trend, just this year actually, in which finders are<br/>
suggesting that I make my clues clearer/easier.  I've been a member of<br/>
this group pretty much since its inception 6 years ago and not once<br/>
before this year has anyone ever suggested this to me regarding any of<br/>
my boxes.  Sure, I feel bad if someone travels from afar to look for<br/>
my 3 little boxes and comes up empty-handed.  I know first-hand the<br/>
disappointment in not being able to find a box.  It's frustrating!  I<br/>
want people to be able to find my boxes, YET I want them to be<br/>
challenged on some level.  This particular box's difficulty is rated<br/>
as moderate, not easy, but once the right path is found, it's a walk<br/>
in the park.  Literally and figuratively.  So why should I change the<br/>
clues to make it even easier?  To me that would be boring!<br/>
<br/>
How do others feel about changing the clues of their boxes to increase<br/>
their findability?  What's with 'boxers suggesting to placers that<br/>
they change their clues?  What about the thrill of the find?  Doesn't<br/>
that matter anymore?  Is it all about the F count?<br/>

A few of us boxers out here were discussing the exact same thing.  <br/>
In the past year we've received multiple comments from visitors <br/>
suggesting that we rewrite or alter clues altogether to make them <br/>
easier.  My response has always been--if there's a glaring mistake <br/>
or a change in the terrain in which the box is hidden, then I'll <br/>
adjust the clues.  If it's just because folks want 'instant <br/>
gratification' style clues then I don't waste my time.  I encourage <br/>
folks (of all ages) to expand their horizons and place boxes with <br/>
clues that range from simple enough for a banana slug to follow to a <br/>
bit more difficult for a college student wanna-be to figure out--<br/>
using a myriad of different styles of clues along the way.  I try to <br/>
weave history or a learning point in every clue I create, as well--<br/>
just to improve folks' future odds on Jeopardy or Wheel of Fortune.  <br/>
Don't let the comments discourage you.  Drive on and hope that other <br/>
boxers in your area place boxes with easier clues to give <br/>
the 'instant grat' crowd something to find.  That'll save your boxes <br/>
for the folks who welcome a bit more challenge in life and may even <br/>
cut down on the amount of box maintenance you have, as well.<br/>

DON"T CHANGE A THING! I'm sure that increasing a finders F count <br/>
wasn't the reason you planted the letterbox and created the clues. <br/>
What would you do if they complained about the stamp, carve another? <br/>
The folks that wrote in the log book found the letterbox, so what is <br/>
their problem? Having historical letterboxes(1999- Wow !)is a treat!<br/>

them to use the contact the placer option and adress<br/>

The bottom line is it's your box.<br/>

weekend and had a blast but wished I had also taken more with harder clues....  <br/>
It was our first time out, I wasn't sure if we would be open enough to see <br/>
the  markers explained in our clues and I short changed myself. It was an <br/>
incredible  weekend in Connecticut and I really would have liked to have been out <br/>
there much  longer then we were. I'm getting better though, when I am going to a <br/>
town  now I print up all the boxes in that area and will take them with me <br/>
:o) If I  don't get to them all they will go back in my misc. folder for a later <br/>
trip. I  also call that town and ask for a town street map :o)<br/>

I know that when Deedle &amp; I first started looking for boxes, we'd grumble about the clues being too cryptic to follow, but we NEVER wrote anything in the logbooks about the clues needing to be made easier (OK, granted, maybe that's because we weren't able to find some of the boxes, but on a serious note, we never write anything negative in a logbook).  We'd just say, "When WE plant our boxes we'll make our clues clearer!"  As we found more boxes and "learned" how to interpret clues we've grown to appreciate the strategic ways that people write things, and are writing our own clues that way, too.  In my opinion, how can anyone really pass up that exhilerating "ah-ha" moment when, after grumbling about darn too-hard clues you realize that "THAT'S the tree they were talking about!!!" and that those clues weren't that tricky after all? :)<br/>

And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>

The way I see it....some of us are hunters (enjoying the chase) and some are collectors (enjoying the artistic quality of the stamps)....it appeals to us all for different reasons.  Luckily...in our family...we have a hunter, a collector and a "hybrid"!  At least someone is always happy on the trail!<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely, positively do not "dumb down" your clues. It is a sad fact<br/>
of life that not all of us are gifted with a superior intellect; in<br/>
fact some are quite deficient (shocking news, I'm sure). I would<br/>
suggest you send this person an extra special clue just for them<br/>
directing them to the nearest stamp store where they can spend all day<br/>
stamping pretty, easy to find stamps into their log book. Frankly her<br/>
Ladyship is appalled at the level of stupidity and short sightedness<br/>
that compels someone to write a letter complaining that ones clue is<br/>
too difficult. One would think one would be embarrassed to announce<br/>
that they are too lacking in intellectual gifts to solve a simple<br/>
riddle or follow a map. If someone isn't up to the occasional<br/>
intellectual challenge then her Ladyship must ask herself what the<br/>
devil they are doing playing this game. Keep the difficult clues rich<br/>
with literary inferences, classical allusion and pop-cultural<br/>
references for those of us who have read a book with out pictures or<br/>
can walk and chew gum for that matter. Her Ladyship's personal<br/>
favorite was the "Maturin's Diary" clue. Unfortunately after solving<br/>
the code we found that it was quite distant and her Ladyship has not<br/>
had the opportunity to actually get the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
One thing her Ladyship would like to suggest for clue writers though<br/>
is that unless one is a published poet please avoid the bad rhyming<br/>
clues. Her Ladyship has read more nauseatingly bad poetry since taking<br/>
up this past time than she feels any sentient being should ever have<br/>
to endure. It's not cute, it's not clever; it's just bad. Reading<br/>
amateur poetry is like eating sushi made by an amateur sushi chef, in<br/>
either case you'll likely end up with a nasty case of reverse peristalsis.<br/>

Oh dear.  I am one of those clue writers.  Two of my 3 boxes have bad<br/>
rhyming clues, lol.  BUT, I think poetry should be available to anyone<br/>

&gt; DON"T CHANGE A THING! I'm sure that increasing a finders F count <br/>
&gt; wasn't the reason you planted the letterbox and created the clues. <br/>
&gt; What would you do if they complained about the stamp, carve another? <br/>
&gt; The folks that wrote in the log book found the letterbox, so what is <br/>
&gt; their problem? Having historical letterboxes(1999- Wow !)is a treat!<br/>

Thanks Don and everyone else who has responded.<br/>
<br/>
I don't plan on changing the clues - I did consider it initially, but<br/>
then I thought about it and thought not, but wanted to complain about<br/>
it to the list, lol.  I enjoy the emails from letterboxers who've<br/>
written after locating my boxes, btw!  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my first box is still up and running - it was placed in 1998.<br/>
 We actually have a 4th one up in Rye, NH but never got the clues up<br/>
and we haven't checked it in the 3.5 years since we placed it...<br/>
<br/>
I'm tickled that my boxes are considered "historical", lol.  Now if<br/>
only we could get back out and participate in the hobby/sport once again.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all,<br/>
