Pyramid Mountain Natural Historical Area<br/>
Placed by Wingfoot on 07/06/01<br/>
Montville, Morris County, New Jersey<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Easy<br/>
Terrain:    Moderate with two climbs<br/>
Time:     Approximately 1  hours <br/>
<br/>
This series can be done in conjunction with the Pyramid Mountain series.    <br/>
<br/>
Established after a lengthy grassroots effort to preserve the area from <br/>
development, the Pyramid Mountain Natural Historic Area is over a thousand <br/>
acres of open space rich in natural and historical resources.  Turkey <br/>
Mountain is the lesser-traveled area of the park.  <br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS<br/>
<br/>
FROM INTERSTATE 287 NORTH <br/>
Interstate 287 North Bound, Exit 44 Main Street Boonton. Proceed to Boonton <br/>
Avenue (County Road 511). Turn RIGHT. Proceed 3.3 miles on Boonton Avenue. <br/>
Visitors Center on LEFT (Opposite Mars Court) <br/>
<br/>
FROM ROUTE 23 NORTH BOUND <br/>
Take U-turn for right on Boonton Avenue (County Road 511S). Proceed 4.4 <br/>
miles. Visitors Center on RIGHT. (Opposite Mars Court) <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
100 STEPS LETTERBOX<br/>
Begin at the parking area across from Mars Court.  If a map is available take <br/>
one. Take and follow the blue trail.  Ignore the sign pointing to blue trail <br/>
shortly after you leave the parking lot.  The trail forks before a walk over <br/>
bridge, take the fork east avoiding the bridge.  If you don't shortly come to <br/>
a road, you've taken the wrong fork.  Cross road and continue on blue trail. <br/>
You'll begin to ascend the 100 steps that this letterbox is named for.  The <br/>
100 steps were built so it was easier for workers to put up the power lines <br/>
that cross the park.  At the top of the steps look for and take the red <br/>
trail.  Red trail ascends Turkey Mountain.  You'll pass the beginning of the <br/>
yellow trail at the top of Turkey Mountain.  Begin your decent along red <br/>
trail.  Eventually you'll come to a rock that juts across the trail forming a <br/>
perfect spot to sit and rest.  There are faded red blazes on either side of <br/>
the rock.  You'll have to do a little bushwhacking from here.  From that rock <br/>
go 22 paces at 130 degrees to another rock.  Then go 6 paces at 80 degrees.  <br/>
In a rock crevice, behind a small rock is what you're searching for.      <br/>
<br/>
WINGFOOT'S 10th LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Continue along red trail.  At the bottom, take the merged red/green trail on <br/>
the right.  Shortly the trail splits again, take right onto the green trail <br/>
going up the hill. Eventually you will come to ruins on the right of the <br/>
trail once you reach the top. Supposedly the ruins were a summer place owned <br/>
by an artist who worked for New York's Museum of Natural History in the early <br/>
part of the 1900s. The owner abandoned the cottage when the power lines were <br/>
built. Continue along green trail.  You will come to an overlook, which on a <br/>
clear day gives a fantastic view of the Manhattan skyline.  On the overlook <br/>
you will find a small split tree with a blaze on the right split.  From that <br/>
tree take 22 paces at 220 degrees to a small pine tree.  From that tree go 3 <br/>
paces at 260 degrees to a big rock.  There is a small rock wedged in a <br/>
crevice behind the big rock. Behind that rock is what you're searching for.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Continue following green trail.  When trail splits take left fork onto blue <br/>
trail.  Take right fork onto yellow trail that takes you back to the parking <br/>
lot.<br/>
