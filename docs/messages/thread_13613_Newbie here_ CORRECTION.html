Sheesh, I've typed it out enough times that my fingers should <br/>
automatically fly to the correct letters.  <br/>

&gt; If you are just starting out, you are lucky to be in a box-rich <br/>
area.  <br/>
&gt; You can find dozens of boxes without ever leaving Seattle!  I did a <br/>
&gt; quick look at Idaho and Montana and there are some boxes there, too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey, I hope you don't mind me jumping in.  I just found out about <br/>
&gt; &gt; this "letterboxing" by chance and never have heard about it <br/>
before.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm from Seattle, WA, USA and am a single Mom with three teenager <br/>
&gt; &gt; boys (12,13,15).  I've been taking them on road trips (an <br/>
unwritten <br/>
&gt; &gt; goal of mine is to take them to as many National Parks as possible <br/>
&gt; &gt; before they all leave home).  We're also involved with Boy <br/>
Scouting <br/>
&gt; &gt; and love to hike and backpack and camp and all that fun stuff.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This sounds so cool to me because I think it would add another <br/>
&gt; &gt; dimension to our outings.  And I think will keep my boys <br/>
interested <br/>
&gt; &gt; even more!  Well, okay, me too!  ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Where can I go to learn more about it?  And where to "hunt" for <br/>
&gt; these <br/>
&gt; &gt; hidden treasures?  I don't suppose there would be any in North <br/>
&gt; Idaho-<br/>
&gt; &gt; Northwestern Montana, would there?  I'm taking a short week <br/>
camping <br/>
&gt; &gt; trip there this summer!  ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>
