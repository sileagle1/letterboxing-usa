	 My dog , Budster, was  howling* when I  read a [LBna] post on bought<br/>
stamps.  Dogs have a special sense and I think he was sensing the way I<br/>
think about this, and maybe agreeing with me.  Some bought stamps are<br/>
very nice and intricate enough to directly relate to the surroundings <br/>
where  the letterbox is hidden . (the ones we have chosen)  It is my<br/>
opinion that those who are creative and make their stamps are getting an<br/>
extra amount of satisfaction from this hobby.  More power to them!<br/>
<br/>
* probably only wanted my attention , but thought that it was a funny way<br/>
to write about  this topic. <br/>

BTW - " Has any one put any kind of ribbons on their cars?"<br/>

check your boxes and seeing the improvements your carvings have <br/>
made.  We've got some good ones and some not-so-good ones... some of <br/>
the older ones are special momentos.... it shows where you have been <br/>
and where you are going!<br/>
