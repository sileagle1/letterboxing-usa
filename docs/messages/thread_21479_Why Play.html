why do i letterbox? because it is in my blood. i hope the thrill of finding<br/>
a tupperware box never dies for me. i don't care if these boxes are in the<br/>
woods, in a planter outside a cvs, in my mailbox, on the internet, up a tree<br/>
 in a lake, oh gosh the list could go on and on. <br/>
<br/>
would i continue to letterbox if this list did not exist? you bet i would.<br/>
once it is truly in your blood how can you not? every time i follow a clue i<br/>
feel honored. someone, a someone i might not even ever meet, has trusted me<br/>
to appreciate that small part of themselves that they have laid out in the<br/>
wilds of an uncertain world. has trusted me to be respectful of that special<br/>
place they have brought me to. has trusted me to be respectful of the care<br/>
and love that they have put into that hidden treasure. <br/>
<br/>
i for one am grateful to a whole lot of people. some i have never met.<br/>
vermont viking and susan, mark and sue pepe, teamgreendragon, funhog, ryan,<br/>
wanda and pete, tom cooch, der mad stamper, trishk, the drew clan, the list<br/>
could go on and on.  if you don't know why i am grateful to them then read<br/>
the archives. <br/>
<br/>
i letterbox because it is there. because i want to preserve this wonderful<br/>
adventure for the future generations. <br/>
<br/>
i letterbox because of:<br/>
<br/>
the hike<br/>
the stamp (handcarved or store bought)<br/>
the log<br/>
the mystery<br/>
the sneakiness (still a kid at heart)<br/>
the fantastic people i meet along the way<br/>
the clues<br/>
the quick driveby<br/>
the something is in my mailbox besides bills<br/>
the virtual when the nights are long and lonely<br/>
the beauty of having made that 10 mile hike up the mountain<br/>

You've described an aspect of letterboxing that i've never been able<br/>
to put into words before.  Thank you.<br/>
