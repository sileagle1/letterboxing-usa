funds for my friend's son to get hippotherapy lessons.  This box has<br/>
been VERY successful and has raised $470! (lessons are $115/hr)<br/>
<br/>
I am almost at the end of the list for those who have asked to be put on<br/>
the list to get this box.  So, now I would like to reopen it for anyone<br/>
who would like to sign up.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to learn about Thomas and why he needs these lessons, please<br/>
visit my website: http://www.geocities.com/dscott5377/thomas.html<br/>
<br/>
the requirements for this box are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
- I am asking that you donate $5.00.  However, if you are unable to meet<br/>
that amount, I understand.  And, of course, if you want to donate more,<br/>
that would be very appreciated.  Each 1 hour session at Pegasus costs<br/>
$115.00 <br/>
- You must be willing to mail this Priority Mail w/ Delivery<br/>
Confirmation<br/>
- You must email me with the deliver confirmation number when you mail<br/>
the box out.<br/>
- You will need to email me for the next name on the list - I will not<br/>
include a mailing list in the box<br/>
- I will be emailing each of you individually as the box gets close to<br/>
your name.  If you do not respond, you will NOT get the box.  In this<br/>
email, I will also ask you to confirm your mailing address.<br/>
- This box MUST be mailed out within 3 days of its arrival at your<br/>
house. (I can always change the line up if the box will be coming to you<br/>
when you will be on vacation, etc) <br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for signing up for this box.  I am so happy that with<br/>
your help I will be able to give Donna and her family this gift for<br/>
Thomas.  <br/>

Dear Debbi, please place my name on the list, email is sinnatravels@aol.com<br/>
<br/>
I will be leaving my present address on Jan &amp;th. I will not know where I am <br/>
going for a few more weeks, but as soon as I have an address I will let you <br/>
know..... my email address will stay the same.<br/>
<br/>
I am a traveling certified surgical technologist, so I am usually only at a <br/>
certain place for 13 weeks, unless I extend.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to donate the money for one full session, but it will be mid jan <br/>
or end of jan. or when ever my name comes up on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your thoughtful gift to help Thomas. what a blessed friend<br/>
<br/>
