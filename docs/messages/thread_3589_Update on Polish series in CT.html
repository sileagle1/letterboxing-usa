In checking over our first Polish mystery box recently for grammatical mistakes, we also unearthed a factual one.  It seems the person in question actually died at sea after having been fatally wounded in battle in Savannah, GA.  Only his funeral rites - not burial ones - were conducted in Charleston, SC.  This error has now been emended in the Polish version on our web page (  http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html#Box_19  ) but does not affect the rest of the clues or the location of the box.<br/>
<br/>
The second Polish box is now ready to be placed, but we are awaiting permission for our location of first choice.  It has come to our attention that some stewardship organizations, such as the one for Avery Preserve in CT, would prefer to be contacted first, before letterboxes are placed in areas they are responsible for, so we are trying that approach for this box.  The location seems to warrant gaining permission first, but if it is not granted, we will try to come up with a feasible alternative site.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your patience!<br/>
