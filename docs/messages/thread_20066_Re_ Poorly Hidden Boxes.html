Yes, due to the type of landscape, soil, etc - the environment in that area <br/>
(Dartmoor) is much more condusive to this type of letterbox placement. It <br/>
essentially means that a small hole is dug and the box is inserted and covered - <br/>
either with sod or grass, turf or surrounding material. It is mostly heath so that it <br/>
works quite well.<br/>
<br/>
That is difficult here to say the least - especially in a landscape such as Maine <br/>
where it is primarily composed of rocks and glacial till soil matter. Even worse is <br/>
marine mud which is just the way it sounds - sticky and quite saturated with water.<br/>
The only heath areas are in salt marshes and bogs. <br/>
<br/>
I would advise against plugging boxes for many reasons, mostly due to <br/>
environmental impact. Boxes in heath wetlands should never be placed off of a <br/>
boardwalk or inserted. I have learned this the hard way, and I would not suggest <br/>
placing a box in this manner.<br/>
<br/>
Mark Pepe is taking a trip to Dartmoor and I'm sure there are others such as Music <br/>
Woman and friends who have experienced this while they are boxing. Please chime <br/>
in if I am way off on my descriptives. Thanks!<br/>

indication that in Dartmoor they dig holes is not -- unless by <br/>
careless insensitive and unscrupulous planters (siters).  The <br/>
following quote is from "Let's Go Letterboxing, A Beginner's Guide, <br/>
1998, Janet Palmer:<br/>
Under the Letterboxing Codes of Conduct for letterbox owners:<br/>
Letterboxes are placed only in existing natural holes or cavities. <br/>
Under the bye-laws it is an offence to damage land.<br/>
I wish I could use red text in these posts! to emphasis this point.<br/>
<br/>
And it looks like I'm going to have to take some extra "e's" with me <br/>
to Dartmoor!<br/>
