us will be up and on the Cape early to grab as many of the new boxes <br/>
as we can  and also some of the older ones we missed on earlier <br/>
excursions . Looks to me like the weather will be just fine , and who <br/>
really cares anyhow . Some of our best boxing moments have been in <br/>
the worst of weather . The Cape should be absolutely stuning this <br/>
time of year , and I think a side trip to Nauset beach to see the <br/>
waves kicking up should be mandatory for all in attendance . We will <br/>
look forward to getting together again with some of our partners in <br/>
crime ( You know who you are ) and hopefully get to meet and exchange <br/>
with some new folks as well .<br/>
<br/>
See you on the Cape !!<br/>
