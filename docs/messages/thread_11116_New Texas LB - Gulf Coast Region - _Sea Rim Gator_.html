Sea Rim State Park is located on the Gulf of Mexico.  The park offers <br/>
swimming, canoeing, camping, airboat tours, seashell hunting, <br/>
birding, picnicking, and hiking.  Popular daily activities are hiking <br/>
the interpretive boardwalk over the marshland, looking for <br/>
alligators, or renting a canoe and exploring deeper into the park.  <br/>
You can even camp on a platform in the backcountry, over the marsh.  <br/>
The park has a store and showers!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
The "Sea Rim" letterbox is located in Sea Rim State Park, just south <br/>
of Port Arthur.  From Houston, take I-10 east to the SH 73/Port <br/>
Arthur exit.  Go south to Port Arthur on SH 73.  Follow the signs to <br/>
SH 87, turn right on SH 87 and go 20 miles to the park.  Turn left <br/>
into the Beach Unit of the park.  Take the road to the left just <br/>
after the entry booth, and go east to the tent camping area.  Your <br/>
goal is campsite #24 on the beach side.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Park near this campsite.  If occupies, you will need to figure out <br/>
where the box is from here, and work around the dune to the back <br/>
side.  From the #24 sign, go Southwest at 210 degrees for 18 paces to <br/>
the water faucet.  From the faucet, go 8 paces up the dune, and <br/>
around the right side or a large Spanish Dagger plant.  The box is on <br/>
the top of the dune, one the ground, under a horizontal limb of the <br/>
dagger plant, with dead foliage covering it.  Please re-hide well!! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You are very close to Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Park, <br/>
and another letterbox!<br/>
