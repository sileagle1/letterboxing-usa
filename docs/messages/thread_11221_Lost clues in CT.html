Jay, <br/>
 We've got a copy we'd be happy to send along.  Just let us know <br/>
where.  Unless you're planning on joining the Morris Men on Thurday.  <br/>
Then we'll just bring them.  Hoping you just had a mental lapse and <br/>
not a TIA!  <br/>
           Have fun, <br/>
                Patrick &amp; Amy(I can't believe we have to work today!!)<br/>
