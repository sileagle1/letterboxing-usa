Congratulations on another letterbox. I like your clues very much. <br/>
The mystery location type of letterbox has a great appeal. Hope it <br/>
turns out not to be too far from Vermont - I'd love to hunt for this <br/>
one!<br/>

You have the option, with a clue of this type, of listing it as a <br/>
complete mystery location (could be any state, any continent) or as a <br/>
mystery box wirhin an identified state. (Randy has done one of the <br/>
first type, and two of the second type.)<br/>
<br/>
In which category do you think your box falls? I was able to <br/>
ascertain fairly quickly that it relates to the Battle of Princeton, <br/>
but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't go into the "complete mystery <br/>
location category." It's really your call.<br/>

But by the morning the fox was gone. <br/>

The 55th retreated down the Kings Highway and the 17th was overwhelmed.  <br/>

That afternoon a man lay under the oak tree. <br/>
