Location: Windham, Rockingham County, New Hampshire<br/>
Planted: July 16, 2002<br/>
URL: http://craigc.com/letterbox/deerleap.html<br/>
<br/>
The Deer Leap Letterbox is in a beautiful nature area owned by the Town<br/>
of Windham, NH.  The geology of the area is magnificent, the crowning<br/>
glory being Deer Leap Cliffs, 60 foot cliffs overlooking Moekel Pond.<br/>
<br/>
Plan on spending an hour.  Total walking time will about 30 minutes,<br/>
less if the mosquitoes are chasing you.  The terrain is rocky, uneven,<br/>
and hilly, but manageable and safe for children, except at the cliffs. <br/>
There you will need to hold hands with little ones, but it is easy to<br/>
stand or sit in a safe place and still enjoy the vista.<br/>
<br/>
In spring, be prepared for mud.  There are bridges or at least logs over<br/>
the wettest spots.  Don't be alarmed if you hear gun shots; there is a<br/>
legal, safe gun club within hearing distance.  Hunting isn't legal in<br/>
the area, but in the fall it is safest to wear bright, unnatural colors<br/>
and be noisy.<br/>
