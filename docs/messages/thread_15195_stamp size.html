I tend to keep my personal stamp in the range of 2" x 3" max.. Most of the letterboxes that I have found tend to have a 3"x5" notpad as the logbook and therefore, that size works perfectly for me.  Some people carry one sized stamp and a smaller one for micro letterboxes.<br/>

<br/>
Your stamp will be too big for most letterbox logbooks.  Logbooks <br/>
inside letterboxes are generally 3 x 5 inches or smaller.<br/>
If you want to make big stamps, make the ones you leave in your <br/>
letterboxes big, because most people's personal logbooks are big <br/>
enough to accommodate a 4-inch stamp. <br/>
