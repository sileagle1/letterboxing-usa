Danville, VT<br/>
Caledonia County<br/>
<br/>
Easy<br/>
<br/>
Go to the Danville Green on Route 2. One-half mile down Brainerd Street is<br/>
the Danville Green Cemetery. Pull over and park.<br/>
<br/>
Find the flagpole at the center of the cemetery. Walk a heading of 220<br/>
degrees to the back of the cemetery. <br/>
<br/>
Pass . . . <br/>
Hoyt<br/>
Frye<br/>
Bricket<br/>
Dennison<br/>
<br/>
Stand between Perkins and Tilton. <br/>
<br/>
30 paces to 310 degrees you will find The Unknowns. <br/>
<br/>
Stand with the inscribed stone at your back, facing 320 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Walk the same number of paces toward 255 degrees as the number of letters on<br/>
the stone.<br/>
<br/>
At the base of a tall pine tree, under a small pile of rocks, along an old<br/>
wire fence, you will find what you seek.<br/>
<br/>
Notes: <br/>
- Please bring your own pen and ink pad.<br/>
- The Cemetery is closed to auto traffic from November to May, but    <br/>
  you are welcome to walk in as long as there is no deep snow.<br/>
- This box is inaccessible with any snow cover on the ground.<br/>
- The letterbox is actually on the property of the landowner next to <br/>
  the cemetery. You have their permission to be there. The wire <br/>
  fence is not electrified.<br/>
- Please cover the letterbox with the stones, as you found it.<br/>
- Make sure to check out the nearby letterboxes Working on the <br/>
  Railroad and Covered Bridge.<br/>
