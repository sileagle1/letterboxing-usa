<br/>
Don't do this.  <br/>
<br/>
We can only hope that it is part of some elaborate, intricate scheme <br/>
that is just begininning to reveal itself.  :-) Even if it isn't, <br/>
you shouldn't post images of other people's stamps unless you have <br/>
their permission.  That is just plain rude, IMHO ...<br/>
<br/>
If you find something unusual, imagine first the possibility that <br/>
it could be part of someone's game.  It prolly isn't, but there are <br/>
things going on, and the people behind them often don't chit chat <br/>
about them.  I think they think its more fun that way ... (at least <br/>
that is what my sources tell me).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Here's an ethical Q. If I were checking on one of boxes and there was a HH<br/>
&gt; there can I take it.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, you can take it, but if you don't want to, don't.<br/>
<br/>
