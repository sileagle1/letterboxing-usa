                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our family ventured out yesterday for our first ever LetterBoxing <br/>
excursion.  I squealed in excitement when I spied the container but <br/>
let my son retrieve the sought after prize.  Mom was more excited to <br/>
look through the contents of the box than the kids (6 and 4) who were <br/>
digging in the sand because we were at the beach.  It was our first <br/>
hunt and to our amazement we were the first to log into the journal <br/>
of the Presque Isle Lighthouse in Erie, PA.  Being somewhat of a <br/>
scrapbook enthusiast too, DH snapped our picture in front of the <br/>
lighthouse to put in our new LB/Stamp journal.  <br/>

Happy trails, ERIEsistibleMOM<br/>
