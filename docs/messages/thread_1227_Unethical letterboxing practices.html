he mowed the lawn, while he ran, at work, even in bed before falling <br/>

practices.  A certain Melissa and Dan happened to see a certain e-mail<br/>
saying that the Drew clan was planning to find letterboxes in Mansfield over<br/>
the weekend.  The two letterboxers decided to go there too.  Upon arrival<br/>
they noticed that the Drew clan had not yet stamped in.  They thought that<br/>
perhaps they should leave the Firebolt there just in case they should stop<br/>
by. We hope the Drew clan will ride the Firebolt carefully, and enjoy an<br/>
exciting game of Quidditch on it before it moves on.<br/>
