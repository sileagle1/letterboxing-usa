and Rambles in RI like the back of his hand, and clues to seek the <br/>
Wizard...a sure Rx for letterboxing fun.  I highly recommend this <br/>
series to anyone who has several hours to spend on this delightful <br/>
trail.  The clues are challenging and the stamps incredibly well <br/>
done.  Our time ran out before we were able to complete the quest to <br/>
the Wizard, but Dorothy &amp; Toto, The Witches, Scarecrow, Tin Man and <br/>
Cowardly Lion are all right in place.  I'll have to wait until my <br/>
next visit to beautiful RI to finish the series, but hope many of you <br/>
will take the time to visit this great series!<br/>
