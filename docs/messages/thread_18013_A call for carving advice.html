I am having a little bit of trouble with my stamp.  I am carving on <br/>
the SpeedyBall pink stuff and there is one big section of the stamp <br/>
that should be all white (does that make sense?  hmm...meaning there <br/>
should be no ink on it).  My problem is that no matter how much pink <br/>
stuff I shave off, there are these little lines or ridges that pick <br/>
up ink and tranfer them to the paper.  I have gone back numerous <br/>
times and shaved off more pink stuff, but more spots appear that pick <br/>
up ink.  Any advice on how to solve this little problem of mine?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What I believe to be happening is that you are carving a fairly large stamp<br/>
and you're getting a bulge. IN other words, the are that should be "blank"<br/>
or "white" or "no ink" is bowing down when you ink it and when you stamp it,<br/>
causing the spots/lines to appear.  The way that I stop this is to mount the<br/>
stamp to some type of hard surface, just like commercial stamps are mounted.<br/>
I use 1/4" thick, cut to size, wooden blanks that I've made in my woodshop.<br/>
I'm sure you could find something laying around to use. The purpose here is<br/>
to stop the soft stamp material from bowing or bulging when you press it<br/>
into the ink pad and then when you press it to make the impression on the<br/>
paper.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>

testing it out and you ink it up and then press it onto the paper, the more pliable <br/>
section may be pressed into the paper and show up....BUT if you are going to <br/>
mount the stamp when it is finished, the pliable area will be glued down and <br/>
most likely WON'T show up when you print. I found that out when I finally <br/>
mounted my signature Rustypuff stamp. Mounting it on wood eliminated the problem of <br/>
stray marks.<br/>

<br/>
Is your stamp mounted?<br/>
Rustypuff mentioned that this problem can usually be eliminated once<br/>
the carving is mounted. I've found that the "pink stuff" is too thin<br/>
NOT to be mounted. You really need to consider mounting due to the<br/>
thickness (or lack thereof) of the medium.<br/>
<br/>
If you find that there are still marks once you've mounted your stamp<br/>
then "clean up" the carving a little more. Honestly, I don't mind<br/>
seeing line marks depending on the stamp because it gives a<br/>
hand-carved stamp some character. If all hand-carved stamps always<br/>
looked absolutely perfect then we might as well buy store-bought stamps. <br/>
