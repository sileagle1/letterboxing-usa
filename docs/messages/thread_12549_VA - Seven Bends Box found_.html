<br/>
I and my two micro-boxers drove a very exciting road up to the <br/>
Woodstock Tower on Thursday afternoon.  When we had left home at <br/>
2:30pm it was a beautiful day but as we approached the metal tower <br/>
at 4pm we began to hear rumbling from a distant dark cloud.  Perhaps <br/>
a foolish move, we still climbed the steps to see the Seven Bends of <br/>
the Shenandoah River from an elevation of 2000+ feet and take a <br/>
quick picture (Hmmm wonder if its a good enough pic to post on the <br/>
photo section of the talk list?) before hastening down again (before <br/>
our luck ran out).  Breathtaking isn't a good enough word to <br/>
describe the sight.  The river looks like a giant python writhing <br/>
through the countryside.  <br/>
<br/>
Big fat drops began to come down here and there as we searched and <br/>
quickly found the box.  Great clues - so appropriate with the <br/>
lightning tree and the increasing rumbles we were hearing!  Imagine <br/>
our excitement when we found the first finder envelope!  <br/>
<br/>
I've placed four boxes now and didn't realize they were missing a <br/>
first finder letter of congratulations.  I shall try to remedy that <br/>
for one - I know that the series of 3 have been found at least <br/>
once.  <br/>
<br/>
Ah well - live and learn!<br/>
