Hello!  I went to check out Fountainhead Park with Daughter of the Old <br/>
Dominion and am waiting to find out about reserving its picnic pavilion for <br/>
Saturday, May 31.  It will cost $60 to reserve it for a half day.  That date <br/>
wouldn't conflict with Fairfax County spring break and should be okay for <br/>
school kids.  I didn't think Riverbend had a picnic area and I thought <br/>
something with a central area would be good for us to all meet, eat and <br/>
exchange.  If I can get the reservation, would others be willing to chip in <br/>
on the cost of the pavilion?  <br/>

_____I'd better say at the outset that the 5 remaining boxes in Riverbend Park <br/>
are mine. That out of the way, there is a large picnic area between the Visitors <br/>
Center building and the river; what the rules and/or costs of reserving it are I <br/>
don't know. All 5 boxes can be accessed from the Visitors Center area; the <br/>
ones listed under the Nature Center are just upriver from Muskrat Ramble and <br/>
therefore a longer walk.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello!  I went to check out Fountainhead Park with Daughter of <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Old<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dominion and am waiting to find out about reserving its picnic<br/>
&gt; &gt;pavilion for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Saturday, May 31.  It will cost $60 to reserve it for a half <br/>
day.<br/>
&gt; &gt;That date<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn't conflict with Fairfax County spring break and should be<br/>
&gt; &gt;okay for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; school kids.  I didn't think Riverbend had a picnic area and I<br/>
&gt; &gt;thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; something with a central area would be good for us to all meet,<br/>
&gt; &gt;eat and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; exchange.  If I can get the reservation, would others be willing<br/>
&gt; &gt;to chip in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on the cost of the pavilion?<br/>
