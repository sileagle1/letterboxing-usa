                    <div class="plaintext-content">I generally go out letterboxing on my own and as a lone female hiker without a great sense of direction and minimal compass skills I don't feel comfortable on very long hikes in unfamiliar forests. I'm especially weary in forests where there are multiple trails that criss cross each other. So I tend to enjoy hikes that are on straight forward trails and letterboxes with good instructions so I don't get confused about where I am and how to get back. The other thing I do is bring along my GPSr so I can leave virtual breadcrumbs on the trail but I still don't like to venture off too far in a forest maze, in case something goes wrong with the unit. <br/>

Enjoy what works for you and remember there are other people out there with <br/>
different circumstances who would love to participate in whatever way they <br/>
can.<br/>

As for the postal letterboxing, id' never heard of it !  That does sound a <br/>
bit like cheating LOL :)<br/>
