<br/>
My mate, John, and I headed up to North Bend, Washington this weekend (about<br/>
a half hour from Seattle, maybe a little under three hours from Portland)<br/>
and we sought out and scored the Rattlesnake Ledge letterbox!!!  On a clear<br/>
day this place cannot be beat!  <br/>
<br/>
Admittedly, when you try for this one it won't be without sweat.  You will<br/>
exert quite a bit of effort.  You'll feel like you're blowing out your<br/>
calves.  It's only 1.3 miles, but you gain 1,300 feet within that distance.<br/>
If you don't get the picture, I'll explain it...The first part of the trail<br/>
goes STRAIGHT UP.  When you finally do arrive at the switchbacks they are<br/>
not necessarily too forgiving, either.  It's a great conditioning hike for<br/>
sure.  The letterbox was great to find, but the true reward was the view<br/>
from the Ledge itself.  Absolutely incredible!!!  I've never seen such a<br/>
lush, untouched expanse of forest in all my days (Ssshhh! Don't tell Gail<br/>
Norton) and the mountains in that Snoqualmie area provide a breathtaking<br/>
backdrop. <br/>
<br/>
I'm currently working on a new letterbox series and will hopefully post<br/>
clues soon.  Most of the images are carved, just one to go and then the<br/>
magical fun of placing them!<br/>
<br/>
That's the latest from the Pacific NW as far as my letterboxing adventures,<br/>
go.  Thom Cheney's got it going on as far as putting together a Pacific NW<br/>
letterboxing gathering in April.  By the time you all show up, we'll have<br/>
plenty for you to hunt for, "I GUARANTEE!" as the Cooking Cajun always said.<br/>
We might be able to do the soup kitchen thing like Beth did in Connecticut,<br/>
we'll have to wait and see what's in the works.  I'm not sure that's an<br/>
option, but if it is...I've got a great mushroom soup you just might want to<br/>
try.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
