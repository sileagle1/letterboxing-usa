My children are 7 and 11 and we take them all the time.  We even have a stamp for them as well.  I'd say, don't force them to go, but let them if they want to get involved.<br/>

I have a 3 yr. old and an almost 12 yr. old. We've never forced her <br/>
to go, but she's never asked to go either. We just say, "Ya wanna go <br/>
letterboxing?" and she says "Ok."  LOL<br/>
She's never complained out on the trail either and she doesn't fall <br/>
behind. But she does tend to walk too close behind one of us and <br/>
always steps on our feet. OUCH! We have to tell her at least once on <br/>
every hike, "Back off!"  LOL<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The only problems I've experienced with boxing with pre-teens/teens is that<br/>
they sometimes seem to forget that this is all supposed to be "secret". So,<br/>
when asked what they are doing, I've had kids turn around and explain "I'm<br/>
letterboxing, it's this great hobby where you go on hikes and hunt for<br/>
treasure..." Thus far, everyone they've told has been interested and had no<br/>
problems with us hunting in their park/forest/whatever but I do worry that<br/>
they'll start being truthful about our activities with the wrong person and<br/>
inadvertently cause some difficulties for another boxer.<br/>
<br/>
The older ones have their own compasses and maps, everyone gets a set of<br/>
clues and has their own stamp (purchased since only one has carved a sig<br/>
stamp thus far.) They also seem to be more enthusiastic about really long<br/>
hunts, wanting to create ones where people have to go out with camping gear<br/>
and follow a trail for a couple of days, collecting dozens of stamps en<br/>
route, as opposed to going to a location and spending an hour or more<br/>
retrieving just one box. I think it is something of a hobby tie-in - if they<br/>
have a hobby that fits well with boxing (art, camping, biking, whatever),<br/>
they try to tie it into boxing somehow.<br/>
<br/>
