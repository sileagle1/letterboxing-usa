letterboxing.  It might possibly have to do with the fact that I've<br/>
lost my mind.  There we were on our vacation in a foot of snow and I<br/>
was determined to letterbox.  Thankfully he helped me find one in the<br/>
snow...Idaho History 102 in Plummer, ID.  Before that we had placed<br/>
one in the snow because we didn't think we'd find this.<br/>
<br/>
The next day I was again determined to find more once getting to Coeur<br/>
D'Alene.  We travelled to Higgens Point and were amazed to see bald<br/>
eagles immediately.  I almost forgot about the letterbox.  There were<br/>
4 eagles in one tree and others scattered throughout.  What an awesome<br/>
place.  So from there I continued in search of the box, only to find<br/>
everything covered in snow.  So I'm sure the box was there, but I<br/>
couldn't decipher a stump from a log from a bush.  So what do I do,<br/>
continue on to another box.  Only this time I drag my husband who was<br/>
somewhat happy as he got to throw his line in while I was mesmerized<br/>
by the eagles. =-)<br/>
<br/>
Duh Aryn, why didn't you look at the map...we pursue Funghog's box<br/>
downtown and hike FOREVER in the snow and make it eventually to the<br/>
top, at least what we think is the top of a hill and EVERYTHING is<br/>
snow covered so all I could do is smile sheepishly as my husband<br/>
followed along.  Thankfully he had fun throwing snowballs at me and<br/>
reminding me that deep down I knew I wouldn't be able to find it in<br/>
the snow.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for posting about your adventure in Idaho, A-Bear.  I was born <br/>
in Coeur d'Alene and grew up in Rathdrum.  When I was a child my <br/>
family would go every Christmas to Wolf Lodge on Lake Coeur d'Alene <br/>
to watch the bald eagles fishing for Kokanee salmon.  They come for <br/>
the spawning every November and December and taking that trip out to <br/>
Wolf Lodge is a tradition that I sorely miss.  I have been in New <br/>
Hampshire now for 13 years and have seen only one eagle outside of <br/>
captivity in that time (It was flying over our house and I burned my <br/>
husband's breakfast running outside to see it!).  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the pleasant memories!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; From there we went to Spokane.  Still determined to find a box in <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; snow, we miraculously made our way to Manibou Park after being<br/>
&gt; frustrated with the one way streets in Spokane.  I'm all excited to<br/>
&gt; decipher the first few clues and then there I am again-EVERYTHING<br/>
&gt; covered in snow and I can't get past it.  Jason can only smile.  So<br/>
&gt; instead of finding I planted one.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have lost it for sure, but am now in Washington where I don't see<br/>
&gt; snow for the moment so am DETERMINED to find at least one while I'm<br/>
&gt; here.  =-)  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for planting all the boxes out there.  We'll have to return <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; northern Idaho when things thaw out.  =-)<br/>
