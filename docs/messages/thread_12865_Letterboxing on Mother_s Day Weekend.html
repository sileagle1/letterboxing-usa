                    <div class="plaintext-content">I took my wife to see her mother in Syracuse, NY.  Friday we drove <br/>
all day and crashed.  Sat. I was the dutiful son-in-law and did all <br/>
those manly man repairs around the house.  Sun. &amp; Mon. I let the <br/>
women talk while I went letterboxing around Syracuse. <br/>
<br/>
Tom's Letterbox -- found.  I was a full mile and a half from my car <br/>
when it started downpouring.  I looked like a drowned rat by the time <br/>
I made it back to the car.<br/>
<br/>
Carpenter's Brook -- found.  When I found what I thought was an ideal <br/>
hiding place and it wasn't there, I thought I had missed it.  When I <br/>
expanded my search radius, I found it.<br/>
<br/>
Beaver Lake -- found one of three.  I don't think the other two are <br/>
lost, I just wasn't interpreting clues correctly.  Judging by <br/>
comments in the log I did find, I'm not the only one.<br/>
<br/>
Salt Box 56 -- didn't find.  The museum was literally empty expect <br/>
for myself and the one attendant.  She didn't know what letterboxing <br/>
was, but when I said I was looking for a Tupperware box, she <br/>
said "Oh, that!".  I think she was amused.  I spent an hour searching <br/>
every nook and cranny in the museum to no avail.<br/>
<br/>
OCPL Letterbook -- didn't find.  For anyone who's found this in the <br/>
past, they've just changed the book and clues.  You're now looking <br/>
for a completely different box than last years.<br/>
