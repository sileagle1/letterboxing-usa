                    <div class="plaintext-content">We took off on a little escapade in N. CA and found a very 'rockin' <br/>
letterbox; fortunately, the ground was pleasantly stable today.  The <br/>
Loma Prieta Earthquake LB at The Forest of Nisene Marks SP was <br/>
extremely fascinating.  What an educational event when we found the <br/>
very large box!!!  The adventure along the way was a lot of fun, <br/>
too!  Thanks for a neat little outing in this neck of the woods.  <br/>
Many, many, many visitors to this box from ALL AROUND the WORLD--<br/>
several of whom weren't even letterboxers (thank goodness they left <br/>
the box in great shape)!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Again thanks for a neat little adventure through an old logging town,<br/>
