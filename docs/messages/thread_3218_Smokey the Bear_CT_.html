                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you so very much Bill and Val of Letterboxing Central for a truly <br/>
enjoyable hike/walk thru Session Woods in Bristol. We were the first to stamp <br/>
in at all the boxes. We also bagged the #3 Christmas Series box which we were <br/>
also the first to do so. A clean sweep. Thank you Amy. But Amy, where are 1 &amp; <br/>
2? <br/>
Well, Bill &amp; Val, you know what was next. Yup, we picked up the "Walkabout <br/>
Hitchhiker" which was hanging out with Smokey himself. That's two hitchhikers <br/>
in one week -- not too shabby. The kids enjoyed all the extras too with <br/>
Smokey. 'Nuf said right? <br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
