<br/>
What better way to travel to Maine than in a LeMans Blue Metallic Corvette Convertible? I drove to the Vacationland with the top down and rocking to my polka CD.<br/>
<br/>
Holeb Public Reserved Land is accessed from a logging road north of Jackman, which is about 16 miles from the Canadian border. In other words, it is way up there. I rented a kayak from Cry of The Loon and off I went on the Moose River Bow Trip. Three days of adventure with only one major portage. The area is known for its moose, black bear, coyote, and many types of waterfowl. The moose sightings were the highlight of the trip. <br/>
<br/>
Traveling downeast I passed through the town of Ellsworth. Being the gateway to Acadia National Park, Mount Desert Island and the Bar Harbor region, it is a busy place. It did not surprise me to hear that Wisconsin Hiker was in the area; after all she does love those long hikes. What did surprise me was the ruckus she created at The Telephone Museum. It is my understanding the museum's cell phone collection is now in pieces. She was allowed to place one phone call to her husband on the traditional line. During the course of the conversation, she casually mentioned, in a strategically timed manner, that she was in desperate need of bail money if she was to continue letterboxing. I never did find out how it all ended. <br/>
<br/>
While DeLorme is not my favorite map, it is the creator of my favorite globe. Eartha is an illuminated 3-dimensional model of our earth, built on a scale of one inch equaling nearly 16 miles. Every continent and ocean is detailed, showing levels of vegetation, major roadways, cities and ocean depths. If you are ever in the neighborhood drop in and take a look. <br/>
<br/>
What would a trip to Maine be without lobster? The Maine Lobster Festival in Rockland is just plain fun. The Great International William Atwood Lobster Crate Race is only one of the many highlights. This year a 12-year-old boy from Connecticut broke the record, crossing over 4,501 crates before he fell into the Atlantic. But, I did not come here to talk about moose, cell phones, maps or lobster crates; I came to talk letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Maine is doing pretty good in the mysteries, over 100 of them. The traditionals are numbering around 750. The percentages fare better than most states. Most of the containers are sturdy. However, this does not accomplish much if they are not covered. When replacing a box, hide it better than you found it. Maine has ticks and mosquitoes, so be sure to wear insect repellent. If you run across a moose, remember you are on their turf and they out weigh you. <br/>

Spies? I have no need of spies, I am an Investigator! Did I say that you were boxing without Martini Man? If I remember correctly, he was sleeping it off at the Colonial Inn while you were out doing the tourist act. Next time you should consider waiting till he wakes up.  Maybe that will keep you out of trouble. <br/>

  Dear The Lazy Letterboxer,<br/>
<br/>
  It has never been said that I, Investigator Francis Bacon, left a dame heartbroken. Sniveling, distraught, or murderous yes, but never heartbroken. The best solution here is to have a tequila with that fruitcake. <br/>
<br/>
  Sincerely, <br/>
<br/>

  &gt; &gt; Are you always so sniveling? Perhaps you should do something constructive to get your mind off of this slight. That is, if it is not too much of an effort.<br/>

Dear Wisconsin Hiker,<br/>

Spies? I have no need of spies, I am an Investigator! Did I say that you<br/>
were boxing without Martini Man? If I remember correctly, he was sleeping it<br/>
off at the Colonial Inn while you were out doing the tourist act. Next time<br/>
you should consider waiting till he wakes up. Maybe that will keep you out<br/>
of trouble.<br/>
