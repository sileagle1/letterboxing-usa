I had a vacation day today and had planned to study for a course I'm taking, <br/>
but,it was "such" a nice day I went 'boxing instead!! (of course!)<br/>
Well, I've learned through experience to always have extra water in the car <br/>
and to carry a flash light etc. when on the hike, but today I learned a new <br/>
lesson.<br/>
That lesson was called, check your clue print out before you leave the <br/>
house! At this time I do not have a printer so I go to the public library <br/>
and print out a large batch of letterboxing clues in one visit.<br/>
When the letterbox bug bit me this morning I took a quick look at the map to <br/>
point me in the correct direction, grabbed my pre-packed fanny pack, clues, <br/>
and jumped into my car. Found the start point no problem and found the first <br/>
two boxes without much fuss.<br/>
Then I decided that since I did not know when I'd be down that way again I <br/>
chose to drive to another nearby location for two more.<br/>
Found that start point in short order and headed out on trail. About 10 <br/>
minutes later I realized that the last two or three words of several of the <br/>
sentences on the clue sheet I was using where missing...as in "return to the <br/>
path and turn..........trail"<br/>
"turn......and proceed across the bridge", which of course I could not see <br/>
from where I was standing!!<br/>
Not the clue writers fault at all, the printer set up at the library must <br/>
have been off and I never pre-read the clues so I did not notice...<br/>
There was a lot of backtracking, re-re-tracking, and walking period!!<br/>
Hours after what was really needed I had stamped into the two boxes and <br/>
wobbled my way back to the car...endurance does serve a purpose!!<br/>
So, there is my tale.<br/>
Happy 'boxing to ya!<br/>
<br/>
