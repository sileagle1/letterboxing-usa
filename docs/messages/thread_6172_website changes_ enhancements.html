                    <div class="plaintext-content">I hope nobody took my original post the wrong way. I do think the <br/>
webmasters do a wonderful job and I know they are busy. But I have <br/>
seen a lot of "Does anyone know if XYZ box is missing?" posts <br/>
lately. Some get responses that the box has been gone a long time. <br/>
I've also noticed several posts saying "I'm new to letterboxing and <br/>
I looked for ABC box on my first try and didn't find it." How many <br/>
other newbies that don't post have the same experience but give up <br/>
the hobby before they've really even started? As many of the <br/>
original boxes get older, esp. those placed by now inactive LBers, <br/>
more and more are likely to go missing without notice to the <br/>
webmasters to remove the clues. <br/>
<br/>
I know this would add a lot of work, but it seems to me that <br/>
letterboxing may be hitting the knee of the growth curve - as <br/>
evidenced by the number of posts growing and number of <br/>
newpaper/internet articles lately. We will almost assuredly need <br/>
more webmasters soon, even without creating additional tasks for <br/>
them. Maybe now is the time to figure out how to both reduce the <br/>
workload of the webmasters AND improve the infrastructure.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For some reason I'm under the impression the web site has already <br/>
been divided into seperate area's of the country with different folks <br/>
responsible for each area.  If a webmaster could join in on this <br/>
discussion, we'd know for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I don't believe it is wrong to ask for the addition of a column <br/>
reporting the status of missing boxes.  Improvements to what is <br/>
already in place will keep this hobby fun and ensure a reasonable <br/>
level of responsibility.  After all, placing letterboxes all around <br/>
the country or world, if left unmanaged, soon become nothing more <br/>
than unforgotten pieces of buried trash.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, just because I and others have an opinion regarding possible <br/>
improvements to this site's management, isn't implying that we think <br/>
the webmasters are doing a less than adequate job.  It's already  <br/>
obvious that their existing support is recognized and appreciated, <br/>
and as we gain experience moving forward it can be improved upon too.<br/>

he/she should put a note in his/her clues stating that a box is known <br/>

I know that many people have boxes outside the area where they live.  <br/>
They could ask someone who lives in the area to help them maintain <br/>

care of it if we plant it in an area we're just visiting or we stop letter <br/>
boxing (as so well stated below).  This may be difficult in some (many?) <br/>
cases.  I think I've heard the term "orphan box" before - I don't know if <br/>
that's an actual type of box folks place, or one that seems <br/>
abandoned.  Perhaps if we plant in areas we are just visiting we could <br/>
label the boxes as "orphans" and maybe a local boxer will find it, adopt it <br/>
and look after it (maybe this already happens).  If we find a box in our <br/>
area that appears to be abandoned (log book full, box broken, no contact <br/>
for owner, etc.) is it permissible to adopt it?  Also, how to do you find <br/>
an owner?  None of the clues we've followed so far have an email or phone <br/>
number, although some of the boxes have had that information - but if you <br/>
don't find the box and suspect it's missing,   are there other ways to find <br/>
an owner besides trying a post on this list?  Lastly, one way to find out <br/>
information about a box you're considering looking for is to search the <br/>
archives for it - you should pull up any emails that contain that box's name.<br/>

<br/>
I've been letterboxing for a couple months now but have only been signed on to the "group" for a couple weeks.  Already I've seen enough negativity come across my screen to remind me why I don't subscribe to newsgroups.  I don't know whether "open forum" means to some people that the need for discretion is superceded or whether the temptation to dip into other people's business is just overwhelming when faced with an annonymous opportunity.  But can we PLEASE keep things positive in the postings, mind our own issues in a positive manner, and try NOT to turn anyone off to this group.  There's enough pettiness and negativity in this world without having to deal with it in letterboxing postings.<br/>

improve dramatically as a result of all kinds of input, both positive <br/>
and negative.<br/>
<br/>
It's wonderful if newcomers offer ideas about how the site could be <br/>
improved, but it will be even better if at least some of those who want <br/>
improvements are also willing to do the work. Again, I don't mean to be <br/>
negative, but want to stress that no one is getting paid to maintain <br/>
this Web site and they are doing it on top of already busy lives. <br/>

the ground up.  Check out http://www.geocaching.com/ for an example of a site<br/>
that allows end-users to maintain/edit their caches.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is the Webmasters have already foreseen this need - way before the<br/>
rest of us - and they are secretly working on a new web site that will blow<br/>
all of us away!  This is strictly conjecture on my part, of course.<br/>

<div>Hi, I'm a newcomer to 
letterboxing, so I'll give you some of my insights on the sport and the site so 
far.  First, on clues and placing boxes.  Last fall I went out once, 
at the suggestion of a friend in England.  My family and I searched for the 
Crown Point and Ticonderoga boxes.  After finding neither, though not for 
lack of trying, I sent an e-mail and found out very quickly that the CP one had 
been moved from it's orginal position, and that the Ti box was in an area that 
is suppose to be off limits to the public.  Knowing Fort Ti due to our 
involvement with reenacting and living in the area, we did not want to be seen 
as treasure seeking - something that the Fort does not hestitate to prosecute 
for.....</div>
<div>     I 
recently (about 2 1/2 weeks ago) went out for a second time, to look for the 
Bristol Rock, Morgan Horse Farm, and Champ box.  I had no luck with the 
first two, and was getting really discouraged about this whole thing.  But, 
I did find the Champ box  :-)  , which was very exciting.  I 
posted a message to see if the other two were in existance still, since I feel I 
was in the right spot, esp. with the Morgan box.  But, as of yet,I have not 
had a reply.    </div>
<div>     I have 
found the website easy to use, I've gotten a lot of great tips from it, and 
have been using it to help plan a vacation to Cape Cod this 
summer.  The webmasters have but together a great site, very 
commendable!  I find I can move around easily, and find what I am looking 
for.   I think an area that lists missing or removed boxes would be a good 
idea, or something that updates boxes that are already in existance.  
 </div>
<div>  I have also gotten alot of good advice 
from the group.  When I found the Champ stamp, I realize I should have 
something to clean my stamp off with, now I'll be sure to do have something, and 
I can see it is a concern to most out there.   Bonnie's tale of the nake 
man was a wake-up call.  
I live in an area that tends to be pretty safe and crime-free, and have been 
going out by myself.  And while I try to stay alert to my surroundings, it 
was a good reminder to be on guard.  </div>
<div>     I have 
been enjoying this hobby, and have told a number of friends about it.  So 
far, no one I know of has heard of this.  Is there anyone in the eastern 
NY/western VT area doing this?  (I see a box was placed in Bennington - my 
next one to look for!)    The get-togethers in differant 
parts of the county sound like fun - are there any going on in my neck of 
the woods? </div>
<div>

So, would it be more work to put the clues in and redesign the site, or<br/>
to stay the same way and make the webmasters update everything?  It <br/>
seems like there are enough people that read this list to get the clues<br/>
input fairly quickly, if everyone was willing to help out.  Having set up<br/>
numerous database driven websites, I don't believe the design aspect would<br/>
be all that tough.  That's my personal opinion, of course.<br/>

There is no guarantee of success in your search. If the webmasters decide t=<br/>
o add a "status" category <br/>
to the website, please keep it simple and unobtrusive so that it doesn't gi=<br/>
ve much away about who <br/>
may have visited or when.<br/>

  Having recently become addicted to this stuff and with all the <br/>

letterboxing is going to continue to grow by leaps and bounds.  It <br/>
was very wise to point out that this is a very opportune time to <br/>
rethink and possibly revise things for EVERYONE'S benefit..including <br/>
the Webmasters.  Nothing that has been said has come across as very <br/>
negative to me and I know that everyone here has a great appreciation <br/>
for the webmasters and the ability to find so much information so <br/>
easily.<br/>
  That being said I hope that in this discussion, which is becoming <br/>
very popular,that everyone can remember that each person that speaks <br/>
is just putting out their ideas and not trying to harm anyone else.  <br/>
Questioning things is not only a great way for everyone to learn, but <br/>
also for great new ideas to come about.<br/>

&gt;6) If more people could make their own clue websites and just have <br/>
&gt;the webmasters link to the clues, I'm sure that would make a <br/>
&gt;tremendous difference.  I know that not everyone has the time or <br/>
&gt;access to do this, but some people might if they had some assistance.<br/>
&gt;Perhaps one of the people that has kindly volunteered to help could <br/>
&gt;write a post regarding creating clue webpages or make a webpage that <br/>
&gt;points to places giving free website space and basic instructions on <br/>
&gt;how to create one. <br/>
<br/>
I know that Catbird and Mischief and Eliza B (all of Washington State, like me) already have their clues on their own web sites. I love that, because then I can write to them and ask them how long a hike was, or anything like that. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone in Washington State would like to put their clues on my web site, let me know and I'll work out some forms that are password protected so that you can update/edit your own clues. As long as there are not overwhelming amounts of stuff (thus me limiting my offer to WA state only), this would probably work pretty well. <br/>
<br/>
My web site is certainly not all that the LbNA site is, but for just having clues up, and fast, or doing quick updates or whatever, maybe that would help someone? I could probably give each person their own section.  Let me know.  <br/>

thoughts, and suggestions on this list?<br/>
<br/>
This is an open forum, and people are free to discuss<br/>
and debate their ideas.  The constitution even assures<br/>
us the right to freedom of speech.  Equally, you have<br/>
just as much right to hit the delete button on<br/>
anything you don't like.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of the web site changes - but also<br/>
understand the logistical issue of it, too.  In fact,<br/>
the original poster of the idea indicated that they<br/>
understand the increase in work it would create.<br/>
<br/>
The way I see it, without suggestions and ideas, and<br/>
discussions, this world would be a pretty static<br/>
place.  A suggestion was made.  It is now being talked<br/>
about - pros and cons.  In the end, something may<br/>
happen with it, something may not.  It may get tabled<br/>
for a later time - or maybe, just maybe, someone will<br/>
come up with a great idea that meets the need and<br/>
doesn't create tons of extra work.<br/>
<br/>
As for the negativity, Ed, I don't see it.  This is a<br/>
group of great people.  Yes, there are times of<br/>
disagreement and differing ideas.  So is life.  But<br/>
rarely have I seen in this group those differences<br/>
result in negativity or plain nastiness towards one<br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
We are all here for a common reason and common goal. <br/>
We all love the hobby of letterboxing, love the<br/>
outdoors, love exploring the communities around us.  I<br/>
am sorry if you are interpreting anything here as<br/>
negative.  <br/>
<br/>
I am glad that you have found our group and are<br/>
sharing in the fun of this hobby.  My best suggestion<br/>
to you is to sit back, enjoy the comradery and joy of<br/>
the group, and get a chance to know the people here<br/>
before you pass judgment to quickly.<br/>

Happy boxing!<br/>

Very well said!!  Welcome to our little hobby - I am<br/>
glad you are enjoying it.<br/>
<br/>
I like many of your ideas, and do agree that this type<br/>
of discussion is beneficial.  You never know when a<br/>
great gem of an idea might be hit upon.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, have been toying with the idea of trying to<br/>
create a website for my own clues.  Partly just to<br/>
learn for myself, and partly to make it easier for the<br/>
webmasters.  I guess my only "reservation" with that<br/>
type of system is the posibility for vast differences<br/>
in the way things are posted.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I really like about the current page is the<br/>
"uniformity" of how clues are posted.  It makes it<br/>
easier to quickly find the info one is looking for in<br/>
a clue.<br/>
<br/>
Who knows, maybe there is a way to achieve it all in<br/>
one fowl swoop ;o)<br/>

    Tom Cooch has provided you a sketch of our "elaborate" operations<br/>

several offers of help and this is great to read.  Does anyone know<br/>
HOW to go about setting up a database?  The idea has been kicked<br/>
around previously but none of the group had the expertise - if such a<br/>
person now exists - please step forward in a post to the Webmasters.<br/>
<br/>
    Also, for anyone who is game, why not try to make your own page<br/>
and get it linked - the worst that can happen is a page not found.<br/>
Every person who can provide their own page, and perhaps pick up the<br/>
clues of a few more compatriots, helps the burden tremendously.<br/>

don't see it as negativity to point out that the<br/>
webmasters are VOLUNTEERS who are doing this as an act<br/>
of love or any problems with us issuing our<br/>
appreciation to them.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has a problem with that appreciation and<br/>
looking out for our webmaster friends and sees it as<br/>
negativity perhaps this really isn't the group for<br/>
them, afterall.  Lists have positives and<br/>
negatives--they also have situations that posters know<br/>
nothing about and probably shouldn't comment on unless<br/>
they do.  That would be negativity in it's own right,<br/>
wouldn't it?<br/>
<br/>
Make all the suggestions you'd like but please<br/>
VOLUNTEER your time to make it happen, too. <br/>
Otherwise, please don't blast those who are a little<br/>
more realistic about the whole idea.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the webmasters- I appreciate things just<br/>
as they are.  Maybe we are seeing that growth isn't<br/>
always a good thing, time will tell...<br/>

But then again, just saying that I am negative, aren't<br/>
I? ;o)<br/>
