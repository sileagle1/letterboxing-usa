<br/>
I've created my own place on Yahoo! 360 and I'd like you to connect to me so we can stay in touch. You can view my blog, my photos, my lists - and all sorts of things that matter to me.  You can create a personal page and blog of your own, which will be linked to mine.  That way you'll always know when I post something new.<br/>
