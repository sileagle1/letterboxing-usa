 &gt; Hi folks<br/>
 &gt; It is no secret (now) that my boxes used to be listed online. They are<br/>
 &gt; no longer online. I went to great lengths nearly a year ago to delete<br/>
 &gt; them all and remove them from both AQ listings and teh massive LBNA<br/>
 &gt; datababble. So, with that said, I had thought by saving my membership<br/>
 &gt; and deleting the boxes one by one (painful for someone with 100+boxes)<br/>
 &gt; that they would be removed once and for all.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Apparently I (and some others) was wrong because if you do a quick<br/>
 &gt; little search for "Unclaimed boxes" you'll find a nice little<br/>
 &gt; compendium a la history of phyto boxes in Maine on the following list:<br/>
 &gt; http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxFind.php and if that doesn't work, you<br/>
 &gt; can surely figure out how to search by unclaimed boxes under "Placer".<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Not that it really matters now since the moxie boxes are defunct and<br/>
 &gt; there is no clue associated with them, but it brings up a slight issue<br/>
 &gt; I have with the way in which clues are currently numbered, catalogued<br/>
 &gt; and listed online. This is a fantastic example of what happens when<br/>
 &gt; you give up ownership of your clues and list them online.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Does anyone else see the problem with this?<br/>
 &gt; Really, it's too bad that others can't realize that listing clues<br/>
 &gt; online is a poor way to go.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Phyto<br/>
<br/>
Oh jeez, cry me a freakin' river already.<br/>
<br/>
So, you think someone is going to go to all that trouble just to find <br/>
clues to boxes that aren't there anymore?  Is it me, or are you just <br/>
searching to find something to complain about?<br/>

Yes, I do think many folks - esp. in Maine (that is why I used the<br/>

letterboxing was about respect for nature first and formost, then the <br/>
individualism of the box, then actually finding the thing.  If I were <br/>
one of those on the forefront of this hobby, I think it might make me <br/>
a little cynical or sad to see people tramping up the woods in droves <br/>
and not taking time to read the logbook, study the artwork, rehide the <br/>
thing carefully, or just stop and look around at the reason most boxes <br/>
are in the woods in the first place! (sorry for the run on sentence)  <br/>
That being said, I think this is a wonderful hobby, and as a new <br/>
person, all I can do to make sure that the forerunners don't get <br/>
disinterested is rememmber that I'm in nature, and to take care of the <br/>
things around me.<br/>

Nice points. I can get on board with this, no matter what your<br/>
reasoning behind boxing, be it for the reverence of nature and all<br/>
things beautiful, the science, the art of carving, the clues, or just<br/>
the fun of it - I can appreciate that someone would want to keep<br/>
others interested.<br/>
<br/>
I have been disappointed time and time again when more and more<br/>
placers and long time boxers leave the hobby for lack of good clues<br/>
and boxes and reverence for the spirit behind letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
Three cheers to old boxes!<br/>
Thanks for this most encouraging post.<br/>
