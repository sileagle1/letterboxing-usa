So I just discovered letterboxing, haven't gone out in the wild to <br/>
hunt yet but hope to soon.<br/>
<br/>
I live in southern Vermont, and see that there are some boxes in my <br/>
area but are at least a year old.  Think they're still around?<br/>
They were listed on letterbox.org<br/>
<br/>
And are there any other letterboxers in my area?<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

All of our letterboxes are alive and well. Hope to meet you on the trails or a pre-arranged location for an exchange.<br/>

As a general rule of thumb if I have any question about whether or <br/>
not a box is in place, I use the handy "contact the placer" button <br/>
to ask.  I tend to only do that on boxes that are a couple years old <br/>
though if there's been no indication on the site of a "last visited <br/>
on...".  That's because I box with kids though- if it were just me <br/>
I'm not sure I'd care one way or another because I just enjoy <br/>
getting out there &amp; exploring to be honest.  We've been very lucky &amp; <br/>
I suspect that in Vermont your luck will be equally good- New <br/>
England is heavily planted.  <br/>

Happy Hunting!<br/>

Well it's only been a half hour, but I didn't see where you've been <br/>
invited to join the yahoo group for New Letterboxers - They answer <br/>
lots of questions and can be very helpful.  Also check out the LINKS <br/>
in left screen margin.  ON ALL the groups you join--tho some will be <br/>
redundant.<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
<br/>
And be sure to find your 'local' group.  Click on "Groups Home" at <br/>
top right of screen and search on "letterboxing".  There are lots of <br/>
other groups in addition to this enormous LB-usa one.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome aboard --- just what NewEngland needs - another letterboxer <br/>
and 100+ plants -- why don't you plan a vacation down south?  Or I <br/>
understand Alaska is short on boxes %^)  And don't forget to check <br/>
out the Mansfield Monster Mash so you can load up on Exchanges.<br/>

We just breezed through there recently and found "A Shrine to the Stars", located near the Hartness house (Inn) in Springfield, Windsor County.  Nice stamp, short but pretty walk.  A peek inside the Inn is worthwhile, as is a look at the historical Turret telescope nearby.  Good luck.
