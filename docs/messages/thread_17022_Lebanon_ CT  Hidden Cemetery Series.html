I have to say that at first I missed the humor of the old stamp.  But <br/>
then someone I was boxing with pointed it out to me &amp; I thought it <br/>
was quite clever &amp; quite good.  Maybe the people who were offended <br/>
missed the humor in it like I did at first.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is good of you to be so sensitive to others that you were <br/>
willing to change your stamp as not to offend anyone.<br/>
