Your dilemma is not incomprehensible but neither is it insuperable.<br/>
What our dear Phyto is playing at and what dearest Brian hints at but<br/>
does not make explicit is that in order to find these non-published<br/>
clues you must form relationships, meet people at gatherings and make<br/>
friends. Gradually you will begin to hear about covert boxes, word of<br/>
mouth boxes and the like. If you were attracted to letterboxing<br/>
because of the romantic qualities then direct social interaction<br/>
should be a simple enough matter. If one remains isolated behind a<br/>
cathode ray tube then one shall be missing much of the game.<br/>
<br/>
While her Ladyship has met the dear Phyto, and many other boxing-folk<br/>
commonly known as elitists, with ease and found them to be most<br/>
welcoming and friendly it has become more and more difficult to make<br/>
time to attend gatherings and events. "Heavy lies the head..." as they<br/>
say. It is her Ladyships privilege to call these gentle folk friends<br/>
but is having increasing trouble finding the time to maintain the<br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Her Ladyship will admit that we have begun to find the effort of<br/>
seeking out clues to receive someone's personal traveler to be<br/>
tedious. Her Ladyship would rather just meet people and enjoy a<br/>
pleasant repartee than spend the entire evening as a trained monkey<br/>
performing silly tricks in exchange for a stamp image. Many people<br/>
however seem to delight in this activity.<br/>
<br/>
This hidden layer of the letterboxing game is not unlike what has<br/>
become formalized at the "Letterboxing Underground" Where there are<br/>
secret lairs to which one can be invited if one forms bonds with other<br/>
members however most of the interaction is online. Here again the more<br/>
you interact the more you find but in her Ladyship's opinion this too<br/>
can be a bit tedious. Her Ladyship would much rather pry her shapely<br/>
derriere from the desk chair and get out in the real world and enjoy<br/>
some real human intercourse.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that all this time consuming socializing interferes with<br/>
letterboxing but many seek this as a reward in and unto itself. Her<br/>
Ladyship cannot make time for this and regrets missing out on what are<br/>
perhaps some interesting boxes. It is simply not how her Ladyship can<br/>
play the game at present. If one becomes engrossed in letterboxing and<br/>
it becomes one's entire method of interacting with the world then you<br/>
will find others that share your passion. If you just want to have an<br/>
occasional pleasant distraction on a sunny day then you'll have to<br/>
make do with what is on line. Without doubt it is annoying that one<br/>
deal with all the flotsam tossed in the woods by the inexperienced, or<br/>
worse those who think themselves clever, with only the occasional<br/>
reward of a well-executed box. It would be easier if one didn't have<br/>
to reject all their family and friends and spend all their time in the<br/>
letterboxing world to find the good clues but those who do find that a<br/>
richer experience.<br/>
<br/>
With regret for lapsed friendships,<br/>
