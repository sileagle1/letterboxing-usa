coastline and the letterbox quests.  The Early Bird and Cadillac <br/>
Mountain letterboxes are alive and well. Tom Cooch's Beehive and Sand <br/>
Beach clues were a bit too challenging for us. However, we thoroughly <br/>
enjoyed the hike up to the top of the Beehive.  Thunder Hole eluded <br/>
us as well, though I thought I searched every nook and cranny of the <br/>
small cave.  Troop 372's Eagle Lake Letterbox could not be found by <br/>
us either.  Does anyone know if these last two boxes are still <br/>
planted?  We finished our weekend with the Algerine Coast letterbox.  <br/>
Memlili's notebook is beautifully made as is Leger de Maine's Early <br/>
Bird notebook.  Thanks to all who planted these boxes, making our <br/>
getaway even more pleasurable.<br/>
