Point Pleasant, Bucks Co.,PA.<br/>
Planted Nov. 25th 2001<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Route 32, "River Rd.", south from Erwinna, PA. to right on Dark <br/>
Hollow Rd., stay on Dark Hollow Rd. till a left on Stover Park Rd., then <br/>
left on Tory Rd. Park in lot on left.<br/>
The "High Rocks" area of Ralph Stover Park was donated to the Commonwealth <br/>
by the late author, James A. Michener. It is well known locally for it's <br/>
outstanding views of the Tohickon Creek and geological features. It is used <br/>
extensively as a rock climbing site for experienced climbers.<br/>
<br/>
Type: Moderate<br/>
Terrain: Rocks and roots in places on trail. The cliffs themselves are <br/>
dangerous!!!!<br/>
<br/>
"Winter Night, Full Moon..."<br/>
<br/>
Cross over the road into the park. Go over the "red" bridge. Stop and check <br/>
out the overlooks! Stay on the "circle/square" trail.<br/>
In the fall, when the leaves are gone, there are good views of the <br/>
"Tohickon" below. Hike past flat rock walls here and there..over fallen <br/>
trees worn low by mountain bikes riders who share these trails with you, <br/>
then after the "under or over?" follow the faint arrow at the juncture. More <br/>
walls,and on towards the pines. Right or left? You decide..nature at it's <br/>
best either way. I chose the less worn path with "NLS" at eye height. Now, <br/>
give your "gears" a spin! Up you go!<br/>
Near the top of the "stairs" by the tree faintly marked with the <br/>
"circle/square", 16 paces at 296, onto a faint trail. At the fork 270. Where <br/>
old walls meet, take your feet. See the opening in the wall?,does something <br/>
call this home?, I wanted to put the letterbox there..instead, 5 paces north <br/>
along the back side of the wall. It's in the wall, along the bottom.Please <br/>
re-hide it well.<br/>
When done, go a few steps south to the trail that takes you west. More walls <br/>
with old stories to tell. Maybe this is not the "U" trail but the "lucky <br/>
shoe" trail...check out the natural bridge at the "double shoe", 244 to <br/>
trail and then 310.<br/>
Share the road! I never thought a mountain bike could sneak up on me, but <br/>
with my mind on 'boxing one did, Yikes!<br/>
Enjoy Life!!! '<br/>
Box On!!!<br/>
