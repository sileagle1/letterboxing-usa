<br/>
In 2003, my new boyfriend and I took a hike at Old Marsh Pond in <br/>
Bristol CT. We had never heard of letterboxing, but ran into a couple <br/>
who was letterboxing, and they gave us a clue to find one. Now, that <br/>
new boyfriend is my fiance, and we have been together for 3 years. We <br/>
have recently begun to letterbox every week. We are dying to go back <br/>
to the first letterbox we found, but we don't have the clues and we <br/>
cannot find them online. Does anyone know of any letterboxes hidden on <br/>
a trail that runs along Old Marsh Pond? Being able to letterbox in the <br/>
place that first got us started would mean so much to a young <br/>
sentimental couple. Thanks so much! <br/>
