<div>OK - just to muddy the waters further... how do others count exchanges? I thought this question had an obvious answer until I went to a couple of gatherings and came across the following scenarios:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1 person with 1 stamp = 1 exchange</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1 person with Y stamps = 1 exchange or Y exchanges? (I'm counting 1)</div>
<div> </div>
<div> X people with 1 stamp when all X's are present= 1 exchange or X exchanges (e.g., a family) (I'm counting 1)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>X people with 1 stamp when only some of the X's are present= 1 or (X-Y)? (I'm counting 1)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>X people with Y stamps when Y&gt;X (we exchange with our "family" stamp and our individual stamps so Y=X+1) (I'm counting X)</div>
<div>
<div> </div>
<div>1 dog with 1 stamp = 1 exchange? (I'm counting 1)</div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>1 soft toy with 1 stamp = 1 exchange? (I'm counting 1 - but only if the soft toy in question has its own personality :-)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>X people and Z dogs with 1 stamp? (I'm counting 1)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>X people and Z dogs with Y stamps? (who the hell knows!?)</div>
<div> </div></div></div>
<div>X people and Z dogs and Q soft toys with N stamps? (who the hell knows!?)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>Urrghhhh!!!! I stopped counting after the second gathering because it all got too confusing and decided I'd stick to my P's and F's! I guess it all boils down to the question of whether an exchange is literally a stamp exchange or a people (entity) exchange.</div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>OK - I'll shut up now and duck for cover....</div>
