hoax.   Check out urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl-wtc-survivor-virus.htm, which <br/>
says:<br/>
<br/>
"Comments:   Ignore these warnings. According to every major antivirus lab, <br/>
the so-called "WTC Survivor Virus" doesn't exist; these messages are hoaxes.<br/>
 The bogus alerts began circulating roughly a month after the Sept. 11, 2001 <br/>
terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York. As in the case of the <br/>
immortal Budweiser Frogs virus warnings (which are also false), it's likely <br/>
that this prank was created in reaction to widely forwarded emails of the same <br/>
name — in this instance, containing miraculous or near-miraculous 9/11 survival <br/>
stories in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy."<br/>

You might bookmark the site, or another like it (such as <br/>
www.truthorfiction.com) for a quick reality check when you get an email that claims someone was <br/>
bitten by a snake at a Wal-Mart, or some kid is missing or dying (often these <br/>
kids don't exist), or Bill Gates is giving away his fortune, or Pepsi is dissing <br/>
God, etc etc etc.<br/>
