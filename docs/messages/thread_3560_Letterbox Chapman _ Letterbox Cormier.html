&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; I checked the letterboxes listed in Eastern Massachusetts and <br/>
&gt; was pleased to<br/>
&gt; see that the latest letterboxes my husband and I had planted <br/>
&gt; (10/21/01) had<br/>
&gt; made the list, however the 2 we planted on 10/08/0l did not. <br/>
&gt; Just thought<br/>
&gt; I'd let you know so you can include them in the next update. They were<br/>
&gt; posted on the talk list on 10/09/01 in message 8366. Thanks <br/>
&gt; for all you do. <br/>

I think I may also have missed something in the Valley Falls <br/>

that area look over the page and see if I've overwritten or neglected <br/>
anything there recently? ( www.letterboxing.org/ma/cteast.htm )<br/>
<br/>
It's also entirely possible that I've missed other Southern New <br/>

August: if anyone is wondering what happened to their boxes, please <br/>
let me know.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Jay, Our three letterboxes for Aroostock County,  Maine were missing from<br/>
the What's New list.  They are posted however on the Maine webpage of<br/>
letterboxing.org. (Planted in August, posted on the site in September)  So I<br/>
wasn't going to bother worrying you over it.  I'm sure you have enough to do<br/>
with all the CT/RI letterboxes alone.  But since you asked.......<br/>
Thanks for all you do for all of us letterboxing enthusiasts.  Sorry to have<br/>
missed you at the gathering in RI.  And we were all ready with our British<br/>
Naval salute!!  Hope to meet you sometime!  from the Bonnie and Clyde Gang.<br/>
