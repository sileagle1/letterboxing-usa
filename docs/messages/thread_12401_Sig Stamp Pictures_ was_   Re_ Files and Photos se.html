the photos section, not files..... right???  I created a folder in <br/>
the Photos section for signature stamps and if people would like to <br/>
move their photos over, then I think that may free up space in the <br/>
Files section.<br/>

&gt;     There are a good many photos in the file section.  These could <br/>
be moved <br/>
&gt; to the larger and logical photo section.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      Most digital cameras take pictures at a resolution (and file <br/>
size) much <br/>
&gt; greater than needed for display on a computer screen.  Most <br/>
pictures should <br/>
&gt; be scaled to about 100kb, which gives ample size to be viewed on a <br/>
computer.<br/>
