<br/>
We were very pleased to have the opportunity to exchange with <br/>
LizardButtsFamily (The Hiker aka The Hungry Eye, Lizard Butt, and <br/>
Bookworm), 3vix aka Miss Vickie, Princess Lea, Sleepy Cat, and <br/>
Doublesaj.  Our visit to the Jelly Belly factory was a lot of fun, <br/>
and we bought way too many bags of Belly Flops!<br/>
<br/>
Miss Vickie introduced us to a very dangerous stamp store in <br/>
Fairfield, Stamp Heaven.  The proprietress was unaware of our hobby <br/>
but was psyched to learn about it.  It sounds like she may be <br/>
creating a store box of her own soon.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the boxes we found during our vacation:<br/>
<br/>
Los Gatos Creek Trail #1<br/>
Bull in the Redwoods<br/>
Loma Prieta Earthquake<br/>
Alameda Creek Trail (4)<br/>
Where the Buffalo Roam<br/>
Meyer's Ranch (2)<br/>
Tolman's Peak (2)<br/>
Message in the Haunted Mansion (5)<br/>
Tilden Park (2)<br/>
Trefoil Girl Scout Cookie<br/>
Sushi House<br/>
<br/>
The following boxes were not found:<br/>
<br/>
Leafy (this box is no longer listed in the LbNA website -- probably <br/>
for good reason!)<br/>
Ruth's Hybrid (we found out later we were looking in the wrong place)<br/>
Ocean Beach (right place, no box)<br/>
Alum Rock Park#2 (we've already contacted the placer about his one)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the placers, and to all we met who welcomed us to their <br/>
home territories.  We look forward to returning in a few years and <br/>
seeing you all again!<br/>
<br/>

PS: We just have to brag, although it has nothing to do with <br/>
letterboxing -- we got to ride a Segue at the Tech Museum in San <br/>
Jose!  Very cool!  If the price ever comes down, we picture <br/>
letterboxers Seque-ing all over the place!<br/>
