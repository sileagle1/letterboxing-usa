Why have a particular day?  How about just going out there and planting?<br/>
<br/>
Not to be mean, but yeah, I'm gonna say it, is this to make you feel <br/>
good?  To make you fell like you are accomplishing something because you <br/>
feel there aren't enough mystery boxes in your area?  Why not just go <br/>
out there and plant a bunch of mystery boxes yourself then?  Others will <br/>
follow suit, it tends to be the way.  It is the same as when people say <br/>
there aren't enough boxes in their area, if they go out and plant, <br/>
others will find the joy in them and want to plant their own.<br/>

&gt; *sigh" Cyclonic, I love you to death but sometimes you are such a <br/>
knucklehead. I really think Mark is trying to promote mystery boxes <br/>
all over the US, not just in his little neck of the woods. I think <br/>
it's a fine idea and you will be spanked severely when I see you next.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why have a particular day? How about just going out there and <br/>
planting?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not to be mean, but yeah, I'm gonna say it, is this to make you <br/>
feel <br/>
&gt; good? To make you fell like you are accomplishing something because <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; feel there aren't enough mystery boxes in your area? Why not just <br/>
go <br/>
&gt; out there and plant a bunch of mystery boxes yourself then? Others <br/>
will <br/>
&gt; follow suit, it tends to be the way. It is the same as when people <br/>
say <br/>
&gt; there aren't enough boxes in their area, if they go out and plant, <br/>
&gt; others will find the joy in them and want to plant their own.<br/>

I have no problem in sponsoring another Mystery Day this year.<br/>
We could make it October 21 to make more time. <br/>
I just completely forgot about it this year with Dartmoor and other things.<br/>
<br/>
Any interest????<br/>

Do you not have an AQ calendar? It's listed there, October 7th, for<br/>
all the world to see! (It's also listed for the 2008 editions, also<br/>
October 7th. Check out<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/marketplace/calendar/samples/2008/ if you<br/>
need  calendar to remind you for next year. *wink*)<br/>
<br/>
Nope, October 21st isn't going to work. It's already on the calendar.<br/>
*shaking head* =)<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit, though, even though I have a calendar, I still forgot<br/>
about it this year, so mixed up with the big update I did earlier in<br/>
the week. I'm still fixing bugs and problems from that (though not<br/>
nearly as insidious or easy to find as that first day!)<br/>
<br/>
At the very least, instead of planting a bunch of mystery boxes, we<br/>
can all *solve* a mystery box this year. I could make time on October<br/>
7th to do that. =)<br/>
