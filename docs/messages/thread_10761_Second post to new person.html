Hi Lynne,<br/>
<br/>
Please forgive the second post to you.  A little note about <br/>
letterboxing etiquette - practiced by some but not all.<br/>
<br/>
When you go out letterboxing, it's always nice to report to the list <br/>
which letterboxes you have found, what condition they were in, and if <br/>
you think any are missing in action.<br/>
<br/>
Those of us who plant letterboxes always like to hear feedback - <br/>
especially if the box is damaged, has no pen, has a full logbook, <br/>
etc. so that we can go out and make repairs.  We *really* want to <br/>
know if it appears to be missing so that we can go out and check.<br/>
<br/>
When you really get into the groove of letterboxing, you will find <br/>
that you'll keep an extra stash of ziplock bags, plastic containers, <br/>
pens, and blank logbooks to do "on the spot" repairs to a letterbox <br/>
that needs it.  Stamps, of course, are another matter.<br/>
<br/>
We are a "do unto others ..." kind of group - unique in this world <br/>
right now.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Got both your emails. One of the boxes was the Wilderness Lodge Box at the<br/>
Disney resort that we did on vacation. The hitchhiker was the Magic<br/>
Treehouse hitchhiker and it was in good shape. The cryptic box was the<br/>
Solitude box which was also in good shape. The other two were the Rock<br/>
Meadows box and the Beaver Brook Box both in Belmont, MA. Both seemed to be<br/>
just fine. I confirmed the Wilderness Lodge box on their website. We visited<br/>
the ones in Belmont the begining of October. And Solitude was at the end of<br/>
November. Hope this helps! And thanks for the tip!<br/>
