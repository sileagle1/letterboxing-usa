a replacement was left in a slightly better hiding place :).  I've<br/>
altered my clues page to match the new location.  Very scenic<br/>
location, go for it.<br/>
<br/>
Every Day is Earth Day -- I was expecting this one to be gone too.  I<br/>
had gotten two reports that it was missing, one of which said they<br/>
found only the lid.  It never occurred to me to ask for a description<br/>
of the lid, mine have a letterbox note on the inside cover.  The day<br/>
was utterly gorgeous.  I arrived at sunset to find an absolutely<br/>
breath-taking sunset to the west.  To the east, was a huge double<br/>
rainbow over the pond.  Absolutely picture perfect.  The moments you<br/>
really letterbox for.  The letterbox was a pleasant surprize.  In it's<br/>
original hiding place and well stamped!  It's a thrill to see stamps<br/>
in a box you've hidden.<br/>
<br/>
Lobo the Hobo -- This is a travelling letterbox.  When I got it, I<br/>
made it a mystery box.  I didn't think it was that hard, a google<br/>
search on "1872 Christmas Eve train wreck" takes you right to the page<br/>
you need.  However, since it hasn't been touched all summer and I want<br/>
it to continue it's travels, I've de-mystified it.  It's on Chautauqua<br/>
County's Rails to Trails, now go for it!  Incidentally, I spoke with<br/>
the President of CCRTT and told him about letterboxing.  He thinks<br/>
it's neat and I have his permission to put as many letterboxes as I<br/>
want along the 30 miles of trails.<br/>
<br/>
Buffalo Wings -- Adopted from Amanda from Seattle.  Alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
In Search of Charles Burchfield -- R.I.P.  It's gone.  And the site is<br/>
no longer suitable for a replacement box.  What was once a simple path<br/>
down to the stream is now a monument to an Indian treaty on heavily<br/>
landscaped and gardened ground.  The original hiding place is now<br/>
heavily overgrown with brush.  I've informed JeLyBeAn by private e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
I realize I have more adoptees yet to check on, but Grad School is<br/>
keeping my busy.  I have no time to box anymore!<br/>
