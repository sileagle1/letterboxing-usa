and thoughts.  Please continue to keep us in your prayers and thoughts <br/>

I have been advised that our son's story is in the news, <br/>
http://www.culvercitynews.com/articles/index.cfm?<br/>
artOID=325013&amp;webpage=1207&amp;cp=1691 .  In order to make sure justice is <br/>
done we can not discuss the details of our son's case.  We thank you <br/>
for understanding, and continuing to uplift us in your prayers and <br/>
thoughts through this most difficult time.<br/>
<br/>

In Christ,<br/>
