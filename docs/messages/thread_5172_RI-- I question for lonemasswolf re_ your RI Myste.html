<br/>
<br/>
I have been working on your RI Mystery box.  Is this box still <br/>
active?  If so could you please email me your email address?  I would <br/>
like to ask you some questions.  For example, I have found RI <br/>
Historical Cemetery #42.  Are cemetery numbers in RI unique?  I have <br/>
a lot of scratches on my legs from looking for this box (next time I <br/>
will wear long pants LOL.)  I have a few questions I would like to <br/>
ask you to see if I am on the right track but do not want to post in <br/>
public forum so I do not spoil the clues for others.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
<br/>

The last I heard, it was still there.<br/>
One big clue, however, if you are not near the wolf, or a geographic feature<br/>
so named, you are in the wrong part of RI.<br/>

<br/>
I just found out that there's more than one cemetery #42 in RI so I <br/>
think I was at the wrong cemetary.   I have some ideas where to look <br/>
next so I am going to keep looking!<br/>
