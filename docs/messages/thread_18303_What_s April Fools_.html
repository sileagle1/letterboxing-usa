all these emails I'll have to go back and check out the rest of the <br/>
info on boxcaching.  Since I don't check this site as much as I used <br/>
to I really did think my computer was losing it.  =-)  <br/>
<br/>
I can barely turn my computer on without it telling me I've caused a <br/>
fatal error so hats off to the amazing efforts to pull something like <br/>
this off.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoying April Fool's jokes in Idaho.  =-) <br/>
