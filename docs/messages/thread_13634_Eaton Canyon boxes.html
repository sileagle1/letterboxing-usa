sunny" california. LOL!  My job allows for a LOT of travel, so <br/>
letterboxing and geocaching are great activities to keep one out of <br/>
the hotel room!<br/>
I located the Meadow Box (placed by Buzzard) with no problems.  the <br/>
scenery was great.  This was my first trip to California and for some <br/>
reason i kept humming the theme song to M*A*S*H!  So after a <br/>
successful find, my buddy and i decided to locate the Coyote Canyon <br/>
box....well, without making a story to long, i was not able to reach <br/>
the box because a rattle snake was blocking my trail!  WHOA! what a <br/>
surprize (and a beautiful snake too!).  however, his rattle shook up <br/>
my midwestern bones too much to venture any further in the <br/>
wilderness, so i called it a day.<br/>
<br/>
any suggestions for boxes near Dover, DE?  or Springfield, Il?<br/>

That's because the Eaton Canyon area has the same general native plants as<br/>
where they shot the show, Malibu Creek State Park. Which, btw, is only about<br/>
an hour drive from Eaton Canyon, though I don't believe anyone has placed<br/>
any boxes there... yet :)<br/>

<br/>
Lucky you! I've lived in this area and hiked the trails my whole life and<br/>
never even heard one of our native rattlers. I saw one once in Arizona, but<br/>
I'm not holding that against the state ;) Though not generally fatal with<br/>
treatment, you did well to avoid your new reptilian friend. Just a few weeks<br/>
back, a man was bit by one, decided to go home and shower before heading to<br/>
the hospital and well, you can imagine how that ended up.<br/>
