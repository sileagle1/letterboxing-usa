When I was a service rep for The Phone Company (remember them?), we were <br/>
instructed to tell people who had received obscene phone calls - or even <br/>
just "breathers" - that the best way to stop it was to not give the caller <br/>
the satisfaction of a response - ANY response.  Even a frustrated sigh or <br/>
slamming the phone down gives them fuel to try you again.<br/>
<br/>
If "public (talklist)" discourse on the kidnapper goes away, is it possible <br/>
that s/he will just quietly quit?  In other words, is it just an <br/>
attention-grabbing maneuver that will go away once the LB populace seem <br/>
disinterested?<br/>
