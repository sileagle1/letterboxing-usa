Pocahontas State Park<br/>
Easy about 1 mile out and back<br/>
Educational (I hope)<br/>
May need a compass, though you might be able to do it without one.<br/>
<br/>
Enter the park through the main gate.  It will cost you $4.00 to get in the<br/>
park on the weekends, $3.00 weekdays.  There are lots of letterboxes in the<br/>
park, and very nice hikes so it is well worth the money.<br/>
<br/>
Park at the main parking lot near picnic shelter #2.  Maps are available at<br/>
the ranger station as you enter.  walk down to the boat ramp.  There you<br/>
will see a footbridge crossing Swift Creek.<br/>
<br/>
Cross the footbridge and take the Forest Exploration Trail to the left.<br/>
<br/>
Go a little ways and on your right you will see a small RED MAPLE with a<br/>
small broken stump next to it.  Directly across the path is a large SOUTHERN<br/>
RED OAK (We call it a Turkey Foot Oak here, the leaves are shaped like a<br/>
Turkey's foot.)<br/>
<br/>
After you cross a small wooden bridge, just past the trail marker ahead you<br/>
will see a gray smooth barked tree with "2001" enclosed by a heart carved in<br/>
it.  This is an AMERICAN BEECH and it is the first choice of lovers to carve<br/>
upon due to the smooth bark.  With the relative short life of most<br/>
relationships today, I guess they need to have some longer lived reminder of<br/>
the good times.<br/>
<br/>
On up the hill, cross the park service road.  When  you come to the next<br/>
bench, sit down.  The tree to your right is a NORTHERN RED OAK.  He has a<br/>
small RED MAPLE friend.<br/>
<br/>
As you continue, when you come to the next trail marker, the tree beside it<br/>
is a WHITE OAK.  There is a larger one directly across the bend in the path<br/>
from it.<br/>
<br/>
Pass by the old beaver pond on your right.  The beavers are gone now but the<br/>
dead trees were caused by the flooding caused by those industrious critters.<br/>
<br/>
When you get to the next wooden bridge, go to the northern end of the<br/>
bridge, and stand on the last plank in the center of the bridge.<br/>
<br/>
At 354 degrees, you will see a large double trunked tree on the hillside.<br/>
Behind, and at the base of this tree is what you seek.  Do you know what<br/>
kind of tree it is?<br/>
<br/>
Dont forget Ladybugs letterboxes (4), MLGaineys letterbox, and Boxitup's<br/>
letterbox<br/>

Hollywood Cemetery<br/>
Richmond, VA<br/>
Not difficult just read the poetry<br/>
This is the first of a series of two boxes<br/>
<br/>
Hollywood Cemetery is located on Oregon Hill in Richmond Va.  From I 95 take<br/>
the US 1,301 exit Belvidere St.  Go south on Belvidere, cross Broad St.<br/>
Take a right on Spring St. (If you cross the James River you have gone too<br/>
far)  Take Spring St. to Cherry St. and take a right on Cherry.  Go one<br/>
block and take a left into Hollywood Cemetery.  The Cemetery is open from<br/>
8:00 to 5:00.  Stop at the office and get a map of the cemetery.  Two United<br/>
States presidents are buried here, along with many notable people.  The maps<br/>
cost $1.00  which, according to the guy in the office is just 2 cents per<br/>
notable. :-)<br/>
Hollywood cemetery is a huge place.  It should be done walking so you get<br/>
the full effect of the place.  It can however be done in a car, if you do it<br/>
this way, follow the blue lines of the tour.  That way you will see the most<br/>
famous people, though you may not see some of the coolest gravestones.<br/>
<br/>
The Clues:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Eighteen thousand lie at rest,<br/>
in the grounds of Hollywood.<br/>
They gave to thier states thier last and best,<br/>
the most that southern men could.<br/>
<br/>
A great stone pyramid rises there<br/>
amongst the noble slain.<br/>
And hard by, on the next hill is where<br/>
lie Gen. George Pickett's earthly remains.<br/>
<br/>
And now, to start your letterbox quest.<br/>
At the foot of the great pyramid,<br/>
"A memorial to the Confederate Women" is the best<br/>
place from which to start your bid.<br/>
<br/>
As you stand and face the monument<br/>
the road beneath your feet,<br/>
to the right is where your feet must be sent<br/>
to find your letterbox treat.<br/>
<br/>
Soon the road will come to a tee,<br/>
and to the right again, your feet must wend.<br/>
Past a leaning hemlock tree,<br/>
until the road comes to a bend.<br/>
<br/>
At this bend take a small rest,<br/>
and cast your gaze ahead.<br/>
Look intently to the west,<br/>
to see, not a tree, but it's sons instead.<br/>
<br/>
The father was once large and strong<br/>
but is gone, leaving only a stump<br/>
make for this stump, and don't go wrong<br/>
where the sons stand atop in a clump.<br/>
<br/>
Beside a stone is where you'll find the loot<br/>
stone four hundred eight to four hundred twenty-five<br/>
To the stone's left, and under a root,<br/>
that grew when the old tree was alive.<br/>
<br/>
As you grasp the box, and a smile curls your mouth,<br/>
have a thought for these southern men.<br/>
This box is dedicated to the flags of the South,<br/>
FURLED BUT NOT FORGOTTEN.<br/>
<br/>
Planted by Healwar and Biki on 9/21/02<br/>
stamp is handcarved. (and mighty good, I might add)<br/>
<br/>
Clues for HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY, #2 of the series are soon to follow, I am<br/>
still working on the verse.<br/>
