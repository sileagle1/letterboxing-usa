Bill-
<br/>Some of us will feel that part of the challenge of letterboxing is
figuring out where the the general geographic area of a clue is located,
and plotting your very own course to it. Some box placers don't even like
to explain their clues even -after- you've found the box. I know that this
seems a little high handed, but it really does help to keep things mysterious
if that is what the box placer wants.
<br/>    I'm glad you've joined the hunt! (You just might
have to do some arm-chair hunting before you go out into the field)

like you've got quite a site coming along!  Do you have a temporary URL<br/>
where we could preview it?<br/>
<br/>
For all:  Just a couple of quick suggestions (seems everyone has 'em,<br/>
doesn't it?).  Perhaps we could make it a point to identify ourselves by<br/>
region when putting up clues and information about where some of our<br/>
letterboxes are planted.  I just read John Roveto's mail (BTW, the gift<br/>
certificate is a fabulous idea, John!) and must admit my ignorance ... I'm<br/>
not sure where the Stone Needle letterbox is located.  Oh, and let us know<br/>
how the gift certificate idea works out, John!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, however much I hate strict rules and regulations, I thought maybe<br/>
we could organize a sort of panel to review the ideas put forth about<br/>
databases, etc.  I'm fairly new to the hobby and not much of an authority on<br/>
the subject at this point, but I'd be happy to do some of the work if it's<br/>
assigned to me.  Deborah's letter got me started on this, too.  It just<br/>
seems that if we pooled our efforts for one big collective website/database,<br/>
we'd rid ourselves of a lot of headaches.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a mutually-agreeable chat time to discuss it?  Just tossing an idea<br/>
out there.  Let me know what you think.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, happy letterboxing,<br/>

<div><span class="880490819-02122000">Thanks 
for your response.  Perhaps you misunderstood my original letter, 
though.  I wasn't looking for more clearly explained clues as much as the 
writer's home state, or country, even.  I see that John's follow-up post 
did, in fact, contain his state (and the clues, for that matter).  That was 
good enough for me.  It's just that if someone writes "Main Street 
Letterbox," for instance ... well, I'm sure that would be fine if it were a 
follow-up to a previous letter that stated the box was in Colchester, CT.  
But some people may have missed the previous step, or just joined the 
list.</span></div>

the hunt.  I've been in the field a time or two.

I think you mis understood me. I was only thinking that for people who<br/>
don't know the area, even finding the location of the park/peserve can<br/>
be difficult. Obviously if the writer didn't write direction the the box<br/>
in the clues I can't place it on a road map. My idea was more for boxes<br/>
such as the one I placed at mashamoquet. The parking lot is very hard to<br/>
find and one can easily get lost.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said before I don't want to step on anyones toes. The whole<br/>
reason for the previous letter was to get peoples explicit permission 0n<br/>
each letterbox that it is OK to use.<br/>
