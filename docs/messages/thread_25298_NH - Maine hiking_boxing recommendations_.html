<br/>
I, for one, would enjoy reading a diary of your experiences.  I have always wanted to (and will, someday, if only to meet Mark and Sue Pepe) visit the chilly but beautiful NE.  Ive the book, My Love Affair with the State of Main, and have read a lot of the short essays by Christopher Kimball (Cooks County) about life in Vermont, and some of the books by Bill Bryson (New Hampshire) and they all call my name.  My former best friend lives in Connecticut  another reason to visit the Letterbox State as well!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can take some notes (and pictures too?) whilst you enjoy your New England Hunt(s).<br/>
<br/>
Anyone second the motion?<br/>

I don't live there but have been several times, especially during fall foliage, and you can't go wrong with the White Mountains and Notches in New Hampshire, especially the hike up Mt. Washington. I have a box on the Tuckerman Ravine Trail called NH high that I intended to put on the summit, but bad weather and trail closures forced me to put it near Crystal Cascade.

Don't worry, Deb - the order for good weather has been in for weeks. No rain this year! <br/>

P.S. We're also looking forward to the gathering. It will be fun to see you again and I see there are a few other boxers we've met before on the attendance list (plus lots of new names to us). Crossing our fingers that the weather cooperates - I've heard there is a tradition of rain for this particular event! <br/>

If you hike up Mount Washington, I recommend Lion's Head Trail. I'm afraid of heights and could not make it up Tuckermen's Ravine, but hiked Lion's Head to the top twice. (trust me - it is still difficult, but not as exposed) Awesome views. I also enjoyed hiking up Black Cap Mountain as well as Willard and Cranmore and I know there are a few boxes on Black Cap and Willard. You can't beat any trail out in the White Mountains. Any hike is an "A+" in my book! <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing you at the gather. I'm staying with Bungalow Boxer (used to be Music Woman) Can't wait to get back to hiking in NH - my second favorite place - Alaska is number 1. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy <br/>

I don't live there but have been several times, especially during fall foliage, and you can't go wrong with the White Mountains and Notches in New Hampshire, especially the hike up Mt. Washington. I have a box on the Tuckerman Ravine Trail called NH high that I intended to put on the summit, but bad weather and trail closures forced me to put it near Crystal Cascade. You could find it on your way up, along with others probably on that trail. Another beautiful place is Franconia Notch and I have a box called Kinsman Falls on the trail to that waterfall. There are many other hikes and scenic views along the Kancamagus Scenic Byway: http://www.kancamagushighway.com/ <br/>
<br/>
Along the coast in Maine my favorite hike is the Marginal Way in Ogunquit: http://marginalwayfund.org/ It is only about 2 miles but very scenic. My box there has been reported missing but there may be others. The Nubble Light in York is also very scenic, but no hike is required. <br/>
<br/>
I'm not advocating my boxes, I just know those areas best, and I'm sure there are many others worth finding. Hope the foliage is still good when you get there. <br/>

&gt; We'll be out east later this month and would be interested in recommendations anyone might have for Maine and New Hampshire. We prefer longer, more rigorous hikes and enjoy finding some boxes along the way. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We'll be flying in/out of Portland and only have 1 week out there. We will definitely spend time in the southern part of the states due to some LB events. We probably won't go too much further northeast of Portland, but are looking at hikes in the White Mountains. <br/>

However, we can guarantee you will have a wonderful time rain or shine!  We are excited to have several letterboxers from our own Great Lakes region joining us for the B&amp;B event this year!  <br/>
After reading Silver Eagle's post suggesting hikes in NH and Maine, it made us wish that he and his wife were joining us up there as well!  On second thought, after Back to Our Roots, where we did manage to get lost and had to hitch a ride back to the event, they may want to stay clear of us flatlanders in New England! Hmmmm... and as we recall there was plenty of rain....but not enough to dampen any spirits!<br/>
As far as we can attest, hiking long or short, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine are some of the most scenic states and have some of the most welcoming fellow letterboxers!<br/>
Looking forward to our next B&amp;B adventure!<br/>
