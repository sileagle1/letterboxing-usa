Cape Henlopen State Park, Delaware<br/>
<br/>
Enter Cape Henlopen State Park and obtain a park map at the entrance.  (Parking fees are $2.50 for in-state vehicles, $5.00 out-of-state.)  Follow map to the Observation Tower.  Climb to the top of the tower and, after enjoying the view, look south along the coast toward twin towers in the direction of Rehoboth Beach.  Facing that direction, look down to your left and locate the paved bike path that appears to lead in that same direction.  Follow that path.  In a short while, you will come to old railroad tracks embedded in the path.  From these tracks, count 25 (adult) paces.  Directly to your left, you will see a large, gnarly pine tree, the Guardian of the Letterbox.  (If you come to a fork in the path, you have missed the tracks.)  Search no higher than your head for the treasure it guards.<br/>
