At least you weren't put in charge of creating an event stamp and <br/>
spelled the name of the darned park wrong.  *grumbling*  Had to <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the suggestions and compliments.  It makes me feel better <br/>
about him.  I've got some options.  <br/>
<br/>
I might make a new stamp with a different pirate.  I don't think I <br/>
would want to carve the same pirate again. <br/>
<br/>
Or I could use this stamp.  I do think it has some character.  The <br/>
pirate thinks he's so tough and mean, but he is easy to laugh at <br/>
because the moron couldn't even put the letters on his hat correctly.<br/>
<br/>
Or, option 3.  I could take my Xacto and slice that hat off of him.  <br/>
Then I could create a hat stamp with proper initials.  Then I would <br/>
use two stamps.  I could also make other hats. Like a baseball cap. <br/>
And then I could make an Abraham Lincoln hat, and an indian <br/>
headdress, and a hat like the pope wears.. . ok, I'm getting ahead of <br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, thanks for all the feedback. Now when I look at the pirate I <br/>
let out a little laugh, instead of a cry.<br/>
<br/>
I'd really like to stamp your books with Captain Backwards.  I have <br/>
never done that before.  Except for I live in Iowa. Maybe someday...<br/>
