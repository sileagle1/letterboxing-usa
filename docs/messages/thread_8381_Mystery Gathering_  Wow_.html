everyone else for a great day, great food, and a chance to meet a <br/>
host of other letterboxers.  By our count we had 10 finds (including <br/>
2 we walked to after the event), 37 exchanges and 2 wonderful event <br/>
stamps.  We were a bit nervous about appearing at our first <br/>
gathering, but everyone was very friendly if somewhat mysterious.  <br/>
The arrival of "K-Martha" was a real hoot.  We also have some <br/>
pictures, but I haven't had time to post them as we are in the <br/>
middle of getting our boat ready to come out of the water today.  <br/>
I'll try to get them posted by this evening.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all who planned, and all who came and made the rainy <br/>
day a great success!<br/>
