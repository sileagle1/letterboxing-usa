                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, this list can get pretty feisty, to put it mildly.  I've found <br/>
much of the talk very informative, even from those who come across <br/>
as less than respectful in their responses.  I am someone to tries <br/>
to learn as much as possible before I start something.  I want to <br/>
make sure I do it right and teach my children the same.  I read an <br/>
article quite a while back that referred to this as questing.  I <br/>
lost the article but searched to learn more.  It seemed like the <br/>
perfect pastime for my family.  It took me a long time to finally <br/>
found out the past time is called letterboxing.  Once I found the <br/>
websites, I read as much as possible and ordered a book on the topic <br/>
as well.  We love taking the kids on day trips and were thrilled to <br/>
see there were boxes in some of the areas we like to visit.  The <br/>
first letterbox we found was a mystery called "Fox at the Water's <br/>
Edge".  We were really impressed to see the kind of detail that the <br/>
creator put into their stamp.  We also loved the 3 part series at <br/>
Cathedral Ledge.  So far, we've most stuck to the easy family <br/>
boxes.  We have 3 children ranging from 2 to 10 years.  As time goes <br/>
and they grow up, we are anxious to try the more challenging ones.  <br/>
Maybe if we are able to get away without them we will try the more <br/>
challenging ones on our own.  <br/>
<br/>
I was able to peak my husband's interest by showing him all the <br/>
boxes listed in his college stomping grounds (Cape Cod).  He quickly <br/>
got the bug and has started creating a series of boxes called the <br/>
Covered Bridge Series.  So far 3 planted,  and have one ready to go, <br/>
all in NH.  These are also family friendly.  As time goes by we <br/>
intend to place more challenging ones too.  We already have many <br/>
ideal locations in mind.  (Having orienteered and hunted he is quite <br/>
good at map reading and using compass). <br/>
<br/>
The topic of picking a stamp was helpful.  People had such <br/>
constructive suggestions and I found it very motivating.  I was also <br/>
relieved to read it is considered okay to change your stamp.  I am <br/>
still looking for input that will tell me what is considered <br/>
appropriate to place for first finders.  Feel free to email me <br/>
privately if this is also considered an annoying FAQ.  I don't want <br/>
to aggravate anyone. <br/>
<br/>
We look forward to many years of this incredible pastime.  We are so <br/>
happy that those of you more seasoned at letterboxing found this <br/>
valuable and have kept it growing.  Connecticut seems to be the <br/>
heart of this and I hope we can get down that way soon and find the <br/>
many hidden treasures.  My children will love finding the Magic Tree <br/>
house series among the many others.  <br/>

<br/>
Questing evolved from letterboxing. However, it is a bit different. This is a very <br/>
helpful site for you to explore. I have led several workshops for environmental <br/>
education organizations on questing this past year. It is quite fun to try questing <br/>
with school children and community groups. <br/>
<br/>
Please check out: http://www.vitalcommunities.org/ValleyQuest/ValleyQuest.htm<br/>
<br/>
The Valley Quest organization maintains quest treasure boxes (as they are called) <br/>
and usually posts updates on their page. It is helpful to purchase their quest book <br/>
which is a catalog of all the quests. There are over 150 now, the original <br/>
publication only has 89 or so listed. Needless to say, this is confined to the Upper <br/>
Valley Watershed in Vermont and New Hampshire, but that isn't to say that other <br/>
folks can't band together and explore questing in their own watershed.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that is helpful,<br/>
