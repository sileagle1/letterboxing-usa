                    <div class="plaintext-content">hee hee  Well, thanks to FoxNews, I think I am in big trouble.  I saw <br/>
an article on their website this morning.  I glanced it briefly and <br/>
printed out a couple places that I was familiar with where I live.  <br/>
After I did the things that my husband wanted to do for Father's Day, <br/>
he indulged me to try and go look to see what this was all about.  I <br/>
was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO depressed that I couldn't find anything, I <br/>
realized that I needed to read up on more stuff, mostly compass <br/>
reading and paces.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm so sure that I'm hooked and I haven't even found my first <br/>
box yet.  I am a little intimated though, I must say, after reading <br/>
some of the cryptic or mystery letterboxes.  I had no idea there was <br/>
even such a thing.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, I'll get the hang of it.  My first question is however, <br/>
what is the best kind of compass to use?  I bought a "lenscratic" <br/>
compass today because I was in a hurry to see if it would work.  I am <br/>
SO SO Lost!!!  hee hee  I read up on the compass lessons and I don't <br/>
have that type of compass.  Am I supposed to find due North and then <br/>
just go in the direction of degrees or am I suppose to be turning <br/>
myself until I get to the degrees?<br/>
<br/>
I could go on, but I really should stop or no-one will answer me.  <br/>
hahahahaha<br/>
<br/>
I'm so in trouble.<br/>
