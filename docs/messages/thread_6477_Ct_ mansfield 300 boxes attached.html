Thanks to all who came to the Historical Society workshop yesterday. There <br/>
were 40 or so in attendance and about half were letterboxers half historical <br/>
Soc. friends and a few seem to be picking up the hobby.  I planted several <br/>
boxes for folks to enjoy and now they will be available to all.  They are <br/>
easy short wet your whistle boxes each with a history lesson. ( Some longer <br/>
ones coming soon.)  One box caled plane spotter was unique i that among the <br/>
audience was a real plane spotter! It was so nice to hear a first hand  <br/>
detail of  the WWII  job.  Anyway have fun with these and as always be Safe. <br/>
