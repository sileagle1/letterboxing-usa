&gt; ...my first inclination<br/>
&gt; is maybe to list good clues for kids as "Good for families" rather<br/>
&gt; than "good for kids" ~ I'd worry that kids may try to find them alone,<br/>
&gt; and I'd much rather all kids be with an adult. Even the simplest clues<br/>
&gt; may be in more isolated areas .....<br/>
&gt; For that reason also, I think a separate page rather than a separate<br/>
&gt; site would be better....<br/>
<br/>
OK, you're helping me to think about this.  Maybe the links can be labeled<br/>
"Family clues" or "Family maps", something like that... and maybe they can be<br/>
integrated with the regular maps, but have easier linking mechanisms somehow...<br/>
Texas pooh, Barney the Florida Gator, etc.???<br/>
I still have to figure out how to make them easier to operate though (the<br/>
mechanics of it).  You big kids out there can help me think about that.  When<br/>
you were a kid how did your mind work???  Actually, now that I think of it, kids<br/>
probably navigate on the web better than most of us!!<br/>

I don't know what specific links you'll be wanting here. have yet to see the<br/>
pooh map people keep talking about.... but I do know that Blue's Clues<br/>
(terrific kids' show) has computer games, and the whole idea is you click on<br/>
something familiar like a big fat icon... green arrow to go to the next thing,<br/>
red stop sign to exit, that type of thing.... the little ones handle it fine,<br/>
as long as they know how to work a mouse, which they pick up quickly!<br/>
