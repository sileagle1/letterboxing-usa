  You're such an amazing example to all of us.  My kids are always excited to think about what you've found, what you've planted, and if you've visited our boxes.  They want to be like you someday, so donj't ever burn out on boxing!!  Slowing down someday may be allowed, but that's it!  Congrats on the milestone --<br/>

No disrespect meant, but how is this possible?  Even if a "short" <br/>
afternoon were 6.25 hours long, this would mean a box every 5 minutes.  <br/>
Now perhaps I am doing something wrong, but 5 minutes is barely enough <br/>
time to pull the box out of its hiding spot, stamp in and rehide the <br/>
box thoroughly -- not to mention time to follow the clues getting to <br/>
each box and driving between the different conservation areas.  Do you <br/>
east coasters have some secret to exponentially expanding the standard <br/>
60 second minute?<br/>

Too bad letterboxing couldn't catch up to you. Just think how many boxes you would have snagged if there were boxes around when you first starting clocking all those miles on your hiking boots back in the day! It boggles the mind...<br/>
<br/>
I wish you many happy finds in the future...I really enjoy you guys. But remember Wanda...I'm watching you! There will be NO sneaking of cooties out of other people's bags and packs just so you can log the find! It ain't a find if it ain't planted on YOU!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Much love - <br/>

with animosity, jealousy and insecurity, it might be difficult for some people to be gracious <br/>
about the accomplishments of others!  Yes, I certainly have put in more than my share of <br/>
"heavy duty" letterboxing days over the past 5 years, and many of them - like the miles I <br/>
did in my former backpacking days - could probably not be replicated, so I am just very <br/>
glad that I was able to do them when I did, and now have the stamps - and achey knees -  <br/>
to show for all my efforts!<br/>
<br/>
However, one experience that can be replicated these days, so that no one need feel <br/>
resentful or skeptical about it, is something that not so very long ago we used to joke <br/>
about, thinking that it was a physical impossibility, but is now accessible to any number of <br/>
folks who might really want to do it, and that is the "50+ box day". Of course, this may <br/>
have long been possible in Dartmoor and has become a fairly common occurence at some <br/>
recent gatherings,  but even on a non-gathering day, it is now within reach of just about <br/>
anyone willing and able to put in the time, effort and organization in a few select <br/>
"letterboxing meccas". I remember when Alan and Jonathan became the first folks here to  <br/>
do a "50+box day" because we were with them on that late November night a few years <br/>
back, and they did a fine job of rehiding the boxes, too!  I personally found myself really <br/>
scrambling all afternoon to get the 50 states boxes &amp; bonuses, smurfs, and other assorted <br/>
confections on a recent trip to Cape Cod (plus boxing well into the night with that great <br/>
little headlamp Eli &amp; Aubrey gave me in Ithaca!), so I doubt that it will be very long before <br/>
someone somewhere is able to find 100+ boxes in a single non-gathering day! Once <br/>
again, however, I must repeat that these occasional "letterboxing feasts" are not the norm, <br/>
are not meant to be competitive, and may even contribute to letterboxing "burnout", <br/>
although they are great fun once in a while!  Anyway, please let's just all try to be grateful <br/>
for whatever boxes we have access to, appreciate the hikes as well as the stamps, and <br/>
thanks to the many fine planters who keep this hobby going!<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In a time when the biggest complaints we hear from letterboxers are about people overly emphasizing the numbers, being careless when replacing boxes and not caring about the letterboxing experience as a whole, why would anyone encourage a 50+ box day, even if it is physically possible?  Instead let's put the focus back on the more leisurely aspects of letterboxing -- an enjoyable time in nature, with friends, enjoy the journey, take time to make sure you are being discreet and the box is replaced carefully -- a quality letterboxing experience with quality letterboxes that a person cannot find and stamp in 5 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
As with so many other things in life, it is not about the numbers, rather it is about the experience.  And if you do happen to be one of those folks for whom it is a competitive thing and numbers really are all that matter to you, please don't encourage this or hold it up as a goal for new letterboxers.<br/>

world often fraught<br/>
with animosity, jealousy and insecurity, it might be difficult for some<br/>
people to be gracious<br/>
about the accomplishments of others! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can't say as that I have any animosity, jealousy or insecurity in the<br/>
letterboxing department.  Hard to be jealous and insecure about something<br/>
that I wouldn't care to do anyway. :-)  Accomplishments?  Maybe.  I guess.<br/>
If someone can do it in one day, personally, that's just not an<br/>
"accomplishment" to me.  At least not one of any significance that I'd<br/>
celebrate for myself.  It would simply mean that people planted boxes close<br/>
enough together in an area and that I had the time on my hands to be able to<br/>
do it.  One reason why I was never interested in Dartmoor I guess. Boring.<br/>
But a ton of folks *do* have fun with Dartmoor.  To each, his/her own.<br/>
<br/>
For what I feel, I wouldn't use "animosity" or "jealousy" or "insecurity."<br/>
However, I *would* use the word "alarm."<br/>
<br/>
In the midwest, in this area, we're experiencing somewhat of a problem with<br/>
boxes either badly rehidden or, even if well rehidden, the contents of the<br/>
boxes are left with baggies left open, or things just shoved back together<br/>
in the box in such a way that leaves a mess, and tops of boxes not replaced<br/>
properly.  In other words, box destruction is becoming more of a problem.<br/>
These could be finders who just plain don't know any better, finders who<br/>
know better but just don't care, or finders who are normally responsible<br/>
boxers but were in a hurry for some reason that particular day.<br/>
<br/>
By encouraging people to do 50+ boxes in a day, I'm just rather alarmed that<br/>
others could be tempted to try to achieve that goal thru irresponsibility.<br/>
I don't see anything wrong with trying to set a goal like that for oneself<br/>
and seeing if it can be pulled off.   I don't know if the Guinness Book of<br/>
World Records shows anyone holding a title for Most Letterboxes Found In A<br/>
Day or not.<br/>
<br/>
I can only hope &amp; pray that if folks set that as a goal for themselves that<br/>
they attempt it with the utmost responsibility towards the placers' boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Some folks like to slide and cruise thru water in a canoe or kayak, taking<br/>
their time, quietly seeing everything nature has to offer, other folks like<br/>
to come along with a 2000 HP motorboat towing 6 waterskiers with their<br/>
sights set on having a wild time.  Some folks are cross-country skiers and<br/>
others vroom around on snowmobiles.  To each his/her own.  I would only hope<br/>
that the folks with the powerboats and the snowmobiles not destroy<br/>
everything in their wakes and that they encourage nobody else to destroy<br/>
everything.<br/>

I am constantly hearing people complain about missing boxes, in large part due to carelessness of other letterboxers not taking the time to rehide the box well.  In my opinion a person who is racing the clock to accumulate huge numbers of finds in a single outing is likely not being as careful about rehiding boxes as they might otherwise be, and even if any one particular person is careful despite their haste, promoting this practice is sure to result in others who are careless in their attempt to quickly move on to the next box.<br/>
<br/>
I know many people on this list are keen on the "no rules" mantra, but there are rules.  There may be a wide range of interpretation and customization to play how best suits your tastes, but there are rules just as there is in any other activity.  If you don't like dribbling a ball down the basketball court, you don't play basketball -- it is not an option to just do your own thing and run with the ball in hand instead.  If we want people to "play right" and rehide the boxes well, encouraging power boxing and idolizing those who amass huge quantities of finds in a short amount of time is double talk. <br/>
<br/>
While one of the biggest complaints of letterbox planters is careless boxers and missing boxes, one of the biggest complaints of new letterboxers is the lack of direction.  Many feel they are left to figure it out on their own and read the Yahoo! groups looking for examples.  Imagine being a new letterboxer and seeing that those finding 50+ boxes in a single afternoon are lauded for their great accomplishments.  It would be conceivable to think that this is then the behavior they would try to emulate.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that anyone preaching "do it however you want to" has no business complaining when people are just out there doing their own thing and not being as conscientious about being discreet and rehiding boxes as we would hope.<br/>

 Subject: [LbNA] Climbing to F12,500 in the Monoosnoc Hills!<br/>
<br/>
     Just had to say how happy I was to have reached F12,500 last weekend <br/>
 along the Monoosnoc Ridge Trail in Leominster, MA! Old Hounder had <br/>
 been telling me that I just had to go do the "Comb City Quest" <br/>
 because I'd really enjoy getting back into that type of hiking, and - <br/>
 sure enough - I completed all 13 boxes in one afternoon, had a great <br/>
 time, and, appropriately enough, got "Pine Forest"( my old symbol <br/>
 from my backpacking days!) as my 12,500th find!<br/>
<br/>
 Well, not so long ago it seems I was just joking about how I would <br/>
 love to find 25,000 letterboxes in my lifetime, to go along with <br/>
 those 25,000+ miles of solo long-distance backpacking that I did in <br/>
 the '80's and 90's ( 5+ AT's, 3+ PCT's, the CDT, and much more!) - <br/>
 and now it turns out I'm already halfway there! Actually, I don't <br/>
 know if I could possibly even have the time, energy and drive to find <br/>
 another 12,500 letterboxes left in me, but it has been fun getting <br/>
 this far! Days like we had recently collecting over 200 beautiful <br/>
 stamps from all over the country at the Great Book Adventure in <br/>
 Tomball, Texas, or hiking half a dozen different conservation areas <br/>
 on Cape Cod last month to find 75 boxes in a single short,rainy, non-<br/>
 gathering afternoon are definitely not the "norm" in our letterboxing <br/>
 experience, where the vast majority of our finds still come from long <br/>
 walks for a single box or two! However, even with a combination of <br/>
 what I call the "all-you-can-eat buffets" (gatherings), the regular <br/>
 everyday fare, and those long searches for single gourmet delicacies, <br/>
 reaching another 12,500 finds seems like quite a stretch! I'll try <br/>
 to keep going, though, as long as time, health, and other life <br/>
 factors permit, and I don't get "burned-out" on it! Meanwhile, thanks <br/>
 so much for the encouragement, and thanks again to everyone who has <br/>
 been so gracious about planting all these wonderful boxes for the <br/>
 general public to enjoy! <br/>

at this that I'm just sticking to my OWN neighborhood,<br/>
as in the town I live in.  Come spring I want to<br/>
branch out and do some traveling to mid and southern<br/>
Maine and find some boxes in my favorite sea-side<br/>
towns.  However I do hope to find the boxes on Saphire<br/>
Beach in St. Thomas the first week of Dec when I'm on<br/>
my cruise.  Wish me luck!<br/>
