                    <div class="plaintext-content">I highly recommend "STLP01.5 LBCON: The Pride of St. Louis (7)" carved by Safari Man for LB CON 2009 and planted by MO UR4ME and I Dig Toasters. This is a series of 7 letterboxes that represent the pride of St. Louis and are beautiful carves.<br/>
<br/>
Also, any carvings by MO UR4ME are not to be missed, time permitting.<br/>
<br/>
And if you haven't already done so, a ride to the top of the Arch is a must do.  A few new letterboxing friends and I actually did our signature stamp exchanges while riding up to the top of the Arch.  It was exhilorating.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your visit to St. Louis.<br/>

Also, skip the arch and spend the day at City Museum.  That's the best spot for kids and grownups to play.<br/>
