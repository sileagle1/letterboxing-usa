I went through the archives and found two references to the new clues <br/>
to that box but not the clues so maybe they went to Cyber space and <br/>
got lost. So I have ammended them and here they are for you so sorry <br/>
to make you do that walk repeatedly. But the box is there now in the <br/>
new spot and with these clues I wish you success.<br/>
<br/>
To Jay and judi sorryif this messes up the new system I was half done <br/>
when I realized I could have done this differently.  Leader of the <br/>
