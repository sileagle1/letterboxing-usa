I was there about a month ago or so.  It's a pretty<br/>
neat place.  The box was in good shape too...<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I was wondering if anyone has done John Tom Hill<br/>
&gt; LB in Glastonbury yet?  I<br/>
&gt; tried to find parking for the trailhead, but was<br/>
&gt; unable to.  Also, there<br/>
&gt; were boulders along a trailhead, but the trailhead<br/>
&gt; said that it was private<br/>
&gt; property.  Did I not go far enough down Birch<br/>
&gt; Mountain Road?  I've been on<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When we did this, we parked roadside near the no parking sign. We took <br/>
it to mean you couldn't park in the field. We did miss it the first <br/>
time by, as it was not as far as we thought it'd be. The Gay City <br/>
trail seems to pass in a narrow corridor between two lots of private <br/>
land.  Look in the blue book: The CT Walk Book for the map. It will <br/>
help a lot.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, we did this with snow on the ground and it wasn't too <br/>
hard.<br/>
