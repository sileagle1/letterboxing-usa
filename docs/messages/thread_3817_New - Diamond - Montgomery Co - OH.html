Difficulty: 2 (1 mile round trip)<br/>
Near Trotwood, Montgomery County, OH<br/>
Placed 28 November 2001 <br/>

State Route 35 Bisects Dayton into North and South.  Five miles west <br/>
of town, it intersects Diamond Mill Road.  North you go on Diamond.  <br/>
<br/>
Through a couple stop signs and across 3 miles of country side you <br/>
pass.  Cross the valley that holds Wolf Creek.  You may think you are <br/>
in heaven  or not.  Regardless, trust to Providence (Road).  On the <br/>
south side a mile down, is the entrance for the picnic area of <br/>
Sycamore State Park.  Go there and park near the small fishing lake.  <br/>
If you are as addicted to GPS navigation as I am, you will know you <br/>
are at N 39 47.922 W 84 22.596.  <br/>
<br/>
You are actually at the beginning when you follow the asphalt path to <br/>
the handicapped fishing platform.  Where else would Flyfisher begin a <br/>
quest?<br/>
