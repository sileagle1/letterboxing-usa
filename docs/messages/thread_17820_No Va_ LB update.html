                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finally got a chance to come up for air today and managed to find <br/>
some Northern Virginia letterboxes.  The following boxes in the <br/>
Alexandria area are alive &amp; well as of 13 Feb 04:<br/>
<br/>
Riverside Park LB, M.V.Tr.<br/>
Frt H.unt LB, M.V.Tr.<br/>
Frog LB, Huntlee M.eadows Park<br/>
Dragonfly LB, Huntlea Me.adows Park<br/>
<br/>
We didn't fare so well with the Squirrel Tree LB at Huntlie Mea.dows <br/>
Park today.  Seems THAT VERY tree fell and it's quite likely that the <br/>
letterbox is embedded beneath the fallen tree in some mud.  <br/>
Unfortunately, we didn't have our gloves or crane with us to conduct <br/>
a more thorough search around the tree.  It's probably still there--<br/>
just not sure if anybody will be able to recover it again.<br/>
<br/>
The Potomac River was simply gorgeous today during a sunny winter day.<br/>
Noticed that there had been some recent visitors in a few of the <br/>
boxes.  How exciting!<br/>
<br/>
Seems a Busy little Bee is buzzing one of these boxes, too! ;)<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail,<br/>

I'm still learning - and I'm trying to pay close attention.  Is the <br/>
reason for the bizarre spelling and punctuation so that people who <br/>
Google for a particular park, site, or trail won't accidentally <br/>
stumble on our letterbox references?  That would make sense to me.  <br/>
Or is there some other reason I'm missing?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

there's an underlying reason for it--google proofing<br/>
