Your box is in great condition and was so much fun to find,<br/>
however, Since you planted it in April you may not have seen the <br/>
poison ivy.  I saw most of it or thought I did until I stood up and <br/>
saw I had been sitting in it.  It is all along that wooden board by <br/>
the small tree.  You may want to edit your site and warn people to be <br/>
on the look out for the creeping itch.<br/>
