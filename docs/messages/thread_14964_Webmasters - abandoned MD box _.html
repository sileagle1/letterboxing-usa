                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have tried to adopt the Bookworm box in Maryland, but haven't <br/>
received any response.  I'm not sure if I did it correctly.  This box <br/>
was placed by the Porch Otters, and is still in great shape.  It is a <br/>
very cool box, and I would hate to see it disappear.  I'm not sure <br/>
how to contact the Porch Otters, but would like to be a caretaker for <br/>
this box if they do not come forward to claim it.   I would be happy <br/>
to turn it back over to them if they do come forward.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
