<br/>
<br/>
     Just a heads-up to let you know that Wanda &amp; Pete's interview <br/>
should be on the website by Sunday or Monday. Thanks to all who have <br/>
emailed us with compliments and suggestions for this on-going <br/>
Interview Series. <br/>
<br/>
     Unrelated - if you have any interest in our Dartmoor National <br/>
Park trip to England in mid September of this year, please email me <br/>
righ away. We are now at 12 letterboxers and will max out at about 18 <br/>
very soon. Our website also has a link to a Dartmoor Trip page with <br/>
some preliminary info. It will be updated Saturday evening as I have <br/>
an appointment with a specialist in British travel tomorrow morning <br/>
and should have much more to share. Plans are underway for a mini <br/>
gathering our first night there with British letterboxers, <br/>
letterboxing, pubs, a few nights in London - plus 2004 is the 150th <br/>
Anniversary of that very first letterbox planted at Cranmere Pool, <br/>
which is still in place!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
