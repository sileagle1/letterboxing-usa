A very good thread came up on our regional list that I thought I would<br/>
be good to bring over here to the big list. For those of us with<br/>
fairly high "P" counts or boxes placed in far-flung locations, the<br/>
issue of box maintance causes concern because the more time we have to<br/>
spend on maintance means the less time we have to go find some boxes.<br/>
<br/>
The discussion began like this:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; One thing I have concluded about my letterboxing during the past<br/>
year -- I spent way too much time doing box maintenance. I've<br/>
considered retiring a bunch of boxes, but have a hard time choosing<br/>
because I look at the list and think, "yes, but people really liked<br/>
that box." I'm not sure what the solution is, but something has to give.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the replies are listed below: <br/>
<br/>
I think the solution is to rely on other letterboxers to:<br/>
1) inform you that a box was found or possibly missing<br/>
2) perform any maintenance that may be needed and to let you know.<br/>
<br/>
If we all helped each other out with this (and the new tools on the<br/>
LbNA site will help) all of our maintenance work would be<br/>
efficiently handled.<br/>
<br/>
It's awesome to have people who can check up on boxes and<br/>
do any light work on them..changing torn or broken bags or replacing a<br/>
box that has been cracked,<br/>
<br/>
Even when boxes are close, we have found that it's just better to<br/>
repair a box...notify<br/>
the owner. We're already there...no sense in having someone else who's<br/>
busy have to run around too.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I couldn't agree more -- sometimes people don't realize how<br/>
important those<br/>
"found your box" reports are. As far as maintenance, a found report is<br/>
just as good as a visit to the box.<br/>
<br/>
By relying on the kindness of strangers to keep us updated, we have<br/>
more time to place<br/>
new boxes since we're not always worrying about the existing boxes. <br/>
<br/>
We've even had someone contact us BEFORE they went to find one of our<br/>
adopted boxes. They volunteered to do any maintenance if we knew<br/>
if it needed something. LBers are great!<br/>
<br/>
Since we really like to take our seat/packs with us on most LB<br/>
excursions, we have plenty of room to carry along extra baggies, blank<br/>
logbooks, napkins for drying out boxes, duct tape wrapped around a<br/>
pencil and a spare container. We have put these "emergency repair"<br/>
items to use on several occasions.<br/>
<br/>
We're glad some of the original placers of the early boxes in our<br/>
state didn't retire them even when they moved from the area and<br/>
apparently are no longer involved in letterboxing. It was exciting to<br/>
find the very first box placed in our state!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Bravo!  I have actually *stopped* doing new plants because of the high <br/>
maintenance issues.  If everyone adopted 1) and 2) as part of their <br/>
letterboxing mantra, I think you'd see a lot more planted boxes.  At <br/>
least I know that *I'd* be planting more boxes!<br/>
<br/>
I have been very fortunate that fellow boxers *have* done 1) and 2) on <br/>
a couple of my boxes, for which there are no adequate words to express <br/>
my gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, *always* do 1) and 2), in addition to carrying a trash bag <br/>
on the trail to pick up yucky stuff along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Way to go, Bindle Babe, for raising the consciousness of us all!  I may <br/>
just go on a planting frenzy this spring!<br/>

<br/>
Depending on the condition of the box and the quality of the stamp, it <br/>
has often crossed my mind to do #1 on a box while in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
I've yet to find a box that was so bad I've been tempted to do #2 on it.<br/>

We don't consider maintenance a big issue. If a letterbox has <br/>
continual problems we pull it. If an orphan has a problem we pull it, <br/>
or seek someone to adopt. If finders can't carry supplies with them <br/>
then they are only hurting other finders. We still plant new boxes, <br/>
but we tend to eliminate older problem boxes much sooner than we used <br/>
to. It used to be third strike and they were out, now it tends to be <br/>
first or second problem and they are gone. In Kernville many of our <br/>
boxes are close and in areas we enjoy going back to, and when we head <br/>
to Seal Beach we feel the same way, so checking and maintaining is not <br/>
a problem it is a joy. <br/>

SInce we didn't have many other letterboxes in the area to find we planted <br/>
quite a few to attract others.  It worked but had too spend a lot of time on <br/>
maintenance.  I didn't always get to them as quickly as I should have.<br/>
<br/>
I've allowed our current P list to dwindle with a sigh of relief.<br/>
