further north for a little camping trip. Boo's Clues and I found Super Sewer in Arcata <br/>
(even though we got a little turned around with my scribbled directions) but sadly we <br/>
did not find the Redwood Forest Letterbox at the Drive-Thru Tree in Leggett. If <br/>
anyone has found this box previously could you please let us know? I took a picture <br/>
of the tree we were looking under and I just wanted to see if we were in the right spot <br/>
or not. The box is marked as unclaimed right now on the website.<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>
