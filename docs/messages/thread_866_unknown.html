list is that the egroups folks have this "privacy" feature built in <br/>
to protect us from spam. It has the unfortunate side effect of making <br/>
it impossible to get an email address, though. So, the easiest way to <br/>
write us is to use<br/>

drewclan @ aol . com<br/>
<br/>
(remove the spaces, which are there just to fool egroups...)<br/>
<br/>
And I'll try and "attach" those two files and send them to the group <br/>
as a whole(your email address is also "protected," John). Sorry that <br/>
planner page on the web is so weird....<br/>
