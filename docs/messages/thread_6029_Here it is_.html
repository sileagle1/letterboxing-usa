<br/>"All the world's a stage and men are but players" 
<br/>As You Like It
<br/>
<br/>Surround yourself by STAGES in that place where, indoors and out, actors give us  course.
<br/>To the BOX go, and travel up hill to a "DEAD" friend. This friend was the "END". 
<br/>Do not turn'round but to where NORTH MEETS WEST to the top of stony stairs.
<br/>Allen: Alas, I knew him well. His end came in 1951 with the first play. (Place the play's   NUMBER in thine head to be recalled when matters make it so)
<br/>Down, down, 1 flight, 2 flights, three, SSW down PAVED and SHADED path where    "animals nor spirits dare not sleep or ride".
<br/>
<br/>    "I'll be a park and ye shall be my deer" 
<br/>Venus and Adonis
<br/>To the edge of a field of sweet grass in sight of a place where fairies and elves frolic by night and knaves by day, you'll seek out OLIVE. She is 14, TALL, SLENDER   AND RUSSIAN.
<br/>
<br/>    "How now, Spirit? Wither wander you?
<br/>Over hill, over dale, through brush, through briar, over park, over pale, through flood, through fire, I do wander everywhere. Swifter than the moon's sphere and I serve the fairy queen."
<br/>            "Midsummer Night's Dream"       
<br/>                    Act II, Scene I
<br/>A bridge with 4 spheres do CROSS and the carriage path as well.
<br/>    From here-- "A Rose by any other name would smell as sweet"
<br/>                    Romeo and Juliet
<br/>
<br/>Find said roses near 100 they be 'cept are shy by those "Men from Verona".
<br/>Carry on the RIGHT PATH, 150 manly footfalls go and bear RIGHT up the   fountain path.
<br/>
<br/>Whence there, count the orbs of light and count them yet again. ADD THIS to the play
<br/>remembered, LESS 1, and this, it be thy new target plan.
<br/>Continue past the SPITTING DUCK and past the "NUT", wave to "HOLLY" of England and stand before the PURPLE PLUM
<br/>Where surest EAST thy will now turn and DOWN THOUST GO 'til the stage is on thy left. It becomes all about "YEW" if thy number be correct!  
<br/>
<br/>"Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?"
<br/>                        Julius Ceasar 
<br/>Act II Scene I
<br/>To STARBORD turn and take a drink for if you thirst now be your chance, near stones, eight sided pile.
<br/>Place Chester Corey on your LEFT and advance on they path
<br/>
<br/>". . .under the shade of melancholy boughs. . ."
<br/>                        As You Like It"
<br/>                            Act II, Scene II        
<br/>(If you have no weapon with which to slay any miscreant you might perchance,
<br/>30 will help protect you.)
<br/>Now, a footbridge hence to 7 BIRCHES stand near place with wooden bench.
<br/>Turn the RIGHT WAY, and travel past where two or four make games and matches.
<br/>
<br/>"But clay and clay differs dignity whose dust is both alike"
<br/>                        Cymbeline 
<br/>Act IV scene 2  
<br/>Change straight from HARD PATH TO SOFT and here, be "privvy" to a place for lord    or lady to drink and rest.
<br/>Spy a LAMPOST past a GRANITE MASS where men of war are honored
<br/>Follow path through o'er hanging flora where babbling on your port side is music to    behold.
<br/>"Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom is breach of all"
<br/>                        Cymbeline 
<br/>                            Act IV Scene II
<br/>And yet another crossing to be made:    
<br/>        "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? 'Tis the EAST and
<br/>            Juliet is the sun"
<br/>                        Romeo and Juliet Act III, Scene V
<br/>Stoney piles lie to you right but they are CONTRARY to the direction you must go for  a score of paces yet or more.
<br/>A FINAL CROSSING where scarcely two can walk abreast, long and narrow ye shall   trod and at the DISTANT end, REVERSE to the RIGHT where trolls are said to dwell.
<br/>Ten planks in and UNDER THE THICKEST LOG  a Rogue stone, flat and darker than   the rest, hides the prize you seek. Dig, yet be of care to fingers and toes as you  return these healthy stones to hide the bounty for the next who seeks the treasure.
<br/>When stamping you have finished, CONTINUE ON THIS PATH (or another you've   since walked upon), ten minutes is all to return you from whence you came.
<br/>                "ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL"
<br/>***Placing here this box at the time when Moon meets Pisces guarantees this hiding place most excellent. Travels for this treasure will cost but 45-60 minutes of your time. Well spent, indeed!
