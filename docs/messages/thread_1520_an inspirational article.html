latest issue of Mother Earth News that I thought might be inspiring to our <br/>
group. Here is an exerpt:<br/>

If you thought GPS mapping and satellite photography had uncovered every inch <br/>
of the lower 48 states, think again.<br/>
<br/>
Paul Rubinstein, Lee Whittlesey and Mike Stevens would like to show you a few <br/>
things they've found. Inspired by Lewis and Clark's unfinished business, the <br/>
three outdoor enthusiasts (Rubinstein is an aerial photographer, Whittlesey <br/>
is an archivist for the National Park Service and Stevens is a high-school <br/>
math teacher) have discovered and photographed more than 200 waterfalls in <br/>
Yellowstone Park that have never before been documented. Their book, "The <br/>
Guide to Yellowstone Waterfalls and Their Discovery" (Westcliffe Publishers, <br/>
2000), hit the shelves this fall. According to Dr. Judith Meyers, a geology <br/>
professor at Southern Missouri State University, the discovery proves that <br/>
there are still spots of uncharted wilderness right under our noses.<br/>
<br/>
"We haven't discovered everything just yet," she says. "We've gone to the <br/>
moon and we've mapped the surface of Mars, but we often forget that discovery <br/>
is an ongoing process. Hopefully, this will remind us that we should take a <br/>
second look and pause to look for things of value that we haven't seen <br/>
before. There may be something undiscovered in a vacant lot downtown or in <br/>
our backyards."<br/>
