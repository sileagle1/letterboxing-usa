today!  It was a beautiful day and we had a great time hiking in <br/>
the park.  We thought that the boxes were a bit difficult to find but <br/>
we persevered.  All the boxes were in good shape, Beaver Lake <br/>
Trail box #2 could use a new box , but a good hearted LB'er has <br/>
helped it out by putting it in a plastic bag. (mlgainey I think).  This <br/>
hobby has really brought my son and I closer together.  I have <br/>
been hiking and being outdoors most of my life, and being <br/>
outdoors is its own reward for me.  My son, however needs <br/>
some incentive, which Letterboxing provides.  Voila!  I get my <br/>
hike and Biki gets a great reason to go!  It makes for good times.  <br/>
Thanks to all of you that plant boxes..... It gives so much to <br/>
others.  Biki and I have only planted one, but we have plans for <br/>
quite a few more.  KEEP ON LETTERBOXING!<br/>
     Healwar and Biki<br/>
