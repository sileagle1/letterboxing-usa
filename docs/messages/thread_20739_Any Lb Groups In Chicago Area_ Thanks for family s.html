Hi - We're new to letterboxing. Just reading about the gathering in <br/>
Roswell, GA sounds soo much fun = I wished we lived closer! Anyway, <br/>
I was just wondering if there are organized yahoo groups in the <br/>
chicago/midwest area too?<br/>

p.s. Thanks to all who wrote back to me re: the family stamp. I <br/>
still don't know what I'm going to do re: the family stamp, but most <br/>
people who e-mailed back to me really thought it was better to make <br/>
my own family stamp even if it wasn't perfect. I wish there was a <br/>
class offered around me to make a stamp like the class offered at <br/>
the Michael's Store a couple years ago. I learn better hands <br/>
on. :)   <br/>

Hi kimberly,<br/>
<br/>
Come on and join us over at the Great Lakes list: <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/<br/>
<br/>
Looks like a gathering is brewing in November in Jackson WI, so that<br/>
will be a bit closer to home than Georgia.<br/>
