<br/>
The weather couldn't have been better for hiking the<br/>
last two days. Too bad the little ones aren't out of<br/>
school yet, or we could have been out all day instead<br/>
of only half the day!<br/>
<br/>
On Monday we went to Great Pond State Park, and nabbed<br/>
the DEP box and the Great Pond box. We checked up on<br/>
the Furry Friends boxes while we were there, both for<br/>
fun and to help out our new boxing friends, Galiana<br/>
and her son, whom we met on the trail. The first Furry<br/>
Friend is definitely gone. The spot that it was hidden<br/>
in is now underwater. On a positive note, it was nice<br/>
to actually see water in the pond. Last fall, it was<br/>
virtually empty. The other two boxes are still waiting<br/>
for more visitors.<br/>
<br/>
Today, we met our new friends at Northwest Park, and<br/>
collected the Birds. We eventually found them all.<br/>
Great stamps, and many thanks to the team of talented<br/>
carvers and planters who all worked together on this<br/>
series.<br/>
