    Just wanted to let you know that your Point Mountain box is still<br/>
there and in great shape.  I'm happy to report that I was the first<br/>
"official" stamp in the third edition of the box log.  Yesterday was a<br/>
beautiful day on the Point and I enjoyed the workout on the rocks.<br/>
Thanks for a wonderful Friday the 13th.<br/>

<br/>
I was wondering if the Point Mountain New Jersey Letterbox was still <br/>
out there.  I went on 5/25/01 and was unable to locate it.  Before I <br/>
set out I realized that the box was planted in 99, so there was a <br/>
chance that it was no longer was there.  With or without the box it <br/>
was a great circuit hike.  Besides a nice walk along a river, where a <br/>
wild turkey and myself scared the stuffings out of one another, there <br/>
is a challenging climb with several great views.  <br/>

Point Mt. is still there, it was checked by it's parent a few days ago..she <br/>
would have been thrilled to see your stamp!<br/>
On Friday I located a box I had been unable to locate the first time <br/>
out...I've done it before and will likely do it again...my personal tendency <br/>
is to make the last few moments of the find more difficult than needs be!<br/>
What fun when you find it on the second go :) Twice now it's been a, <br/>
"DUH!!",head smack, moment for me when I make it to the box... come to think <br/>
of it,I've had lots'o those moments on trail..<br/>
Happy 'boxing!!<br/>
