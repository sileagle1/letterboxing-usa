                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went to find "Keep on Rollin" today, but I had no luck.  I found <br/>
the only two trunked tree that I could see in the area.  The green <br/>
leafy vines are indeed poison ivy.  The tree has several good <br/>
cracks, but I did not see the box.  It looks like the trunk leaning <br/>
twords the river will break off soon and fall.  I didn't check out <br/>
the river for wayward sailing boxes.<br/>
<br/>
"Bully" is safely on his lily pad.  One of the trunks has broken, so <br/>
it is now a 4 trunked tree.  Be as thorough as you can about re-<br/>
hiding this box.<br/>
