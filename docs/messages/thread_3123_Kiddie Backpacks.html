riding on<br/>

I agree, the Snuglis are great.  For your older child I recommend the <br/>
Kelty kidpack.  It's expensive but well worth the money.  You may <br/>
have a problem keeping her in it.  Some kids who haven't spent much <br/>
time in kid packs aren't thrilled when introduced at that age.  If <br/>
she doesn't take to it at least you have it for the next one.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've been using an Evenflo Trail Blazer. It supposed to be good for <br/>
6 months to 45 lbs.  It's got a detachable pack in the back that's <br/>
big enough to carry your letterboxing things and the baby stuff. It's <br/>
a lot less expensive than the similar Kelty. It's really comfortable <br/>
and adjusts in many ways. My daughter is 15 months old and weighs <br/>
about 24 lbs. We both love it!  When we first started using it she <br/>
would always fall asleep in it. For a review of it check out: <br/>
