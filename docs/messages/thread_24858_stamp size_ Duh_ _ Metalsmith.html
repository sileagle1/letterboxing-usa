                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Leslie, Ron here. I earned my General and Powerplant back in '77 <br/>
and while I have done a lot of airframe work, and passed the written <br/>
twice, never finished my airframe. I admire the real metalsmiths. A <br/>
true talent. And for what it is worth, in the Army, I always wanted <br/>
my mechanics to speak up. The ones who wouldn't were the ones I <br/>
didn't trust.<br/>
<br/>
For what it is worth, I carved a just smaller then postcard stamp for <br/>
a card swap and found for doing multi-color (not normal in LB), it <br/>
was border-line too big though it had a lot of blank space that <br/>
impacted the ink drying rate. I like the new lock top containers and <br/>
my next stamps will be sized to fit in them. That will make them <br/>
about 1-3/4" X up to maybe 4". I use the Moleskin Moleskine Pocket <br/>
Plain Notebook (3.5 x 5.5) for my log and find that I like stamps <br/>
that take up half a page so I can journal on the other half. <br/>

Jack of many trades, master of only a few, but I have fun.<br/>

&gt; o.k. found the size. but how does a 4 inch stamp fit into a film <br/>
box? <br/>
&gt; have be under 1/2" to fit there. and would the ledger inside be big <br/>
&gt; enough, if i had a large stamp?<br/>
&gt; you're talking to an old dumb airdale (us navy, worked sheet metal <br/>
on aircraft for 20 years) and we never had to think. only do as told. <br/>
&gt; thinking always got you into trouble (and didn't they love to <br/>
remind us of that) so i can follow directions, and know a few cheats <br/>
on a ruler.<br/>
