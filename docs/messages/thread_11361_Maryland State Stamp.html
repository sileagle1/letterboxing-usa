Mile in Mile out                Planted By The NeeDeeps 3-22-03<br/>
Directions: Coming from the west on RT.101 cross through the<br/>
intersection of 101 and Maple ST. go 0.1 of a mile and pull into<br/>
ST.Josephs driveway on the left. NOT the parking lot,the driveway is<br/>
right past the church.Coming from the east the driveway is just before<br/>
the church on the right about 0.2 of a mile past the RR.tracks.Pull in<br/>
and drive straight to the back and then follow the drive to the left.Go<br/>
straight down the back of the cemetary and in the corner to the right<br/>
you will see the trail and to the left of that there is room enough to<br/>
park a car.( NOTICE THE GATE IS OPEN 8:00 A.M UNTIL SUNSET).Enter the<br/>
trail,and you can tell that four wheel dirt bikes like this trail also<br/>
so keep your eyes open.Walking along notice the pond to your right good<br/>
Bass fishing back here.Keep going on the main trail ignore all the<br/>
little trails going left and right, soon you will bend to the right and<br/>
you will be walking with the power lines up above.Just keep following<br/>
the power lines and you will come to a down hill slope some RR.Tracks<br/>
and up the other side (Look Both Ways Before Crossing The<br/>
Tracks).Continue on the trail following the power lines and you will see<br/>
a fenced in area on the left and way off in a distance you can see a tan<br/>
building thats Frito Lay.Directly across from the fenced in area is a<br/>
trail going off to the right,take this trail and you will walk down a<br/>
little ways and you will see a dirt bike trail going off to the right<br/>
but you keep straight and you will pass through a ravine and come to the<br/>
five mile river.Turn left and go up the hill to the top of the<br/>
banking,follow the path until you get even with the water fall and the<br/>
flood gates.now on your right in a gully you will see a pile of iron and<br/>
blocks of wood.on the right side of that pile under a couple of blocks<br/>
of wood and under a old wooden box is the Maryland letterbox.(Good Trout<br/>
Fishing Here) To return you can go the way you came or go back through<br/>
that ravine and take that dirt bike trail to the left. it will go up a<br/>
hill and give you a view of the pond and river on the other side,and you<br/>
just walk the banking following that trail and after awhile it will turn<br/>
and put you right back with the power lines.they run parallel so it's<br/>
not any longer.The NeeDeeps          <br/>
