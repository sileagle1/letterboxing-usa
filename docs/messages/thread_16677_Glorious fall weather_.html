Hi, <br/>
It's wonderful to hear about the fall weather. Sometimes we do miss <br/>
it in CA. You planted bulbs instead of boxes. I'm sure your efforts <br/>
will be greatly rewarded come spring. Purple Iris<br/>

Re letterboxing:  I plan to place a letterbox on Cape Cod next <br/>
weekend.   It will be at a remote spot.<br/>
