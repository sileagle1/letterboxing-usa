I've been trying to follow all of this latest mumbo jumbo about <br/>
ratings for boxes, trails, whatnot for some time now, but have not <br/>
been able to make heads or tails out of it. <br/>
<br/>
So instead I started looking around on this exciting new "internet" <br/>
that everyone's talking about. There's really quite a bit of <br/>
information out here! Believe it or not, there's a tool <br/>
called "Google" (stop me if I'm getting too technical here) that <br/>
actually finds information that is just floating around out there. So <br/>
if you were interested in finding out, say, about the <br/>
length/difficulty/current-trail-conditions/etc, you could just go <br/>
to "Google" and type in the name of the trail, park, recreational <br/>
area that you're interested in, and in most cases the information you <br/>
want just shows right up on your screen! <br/>
<br/>
It is not difficult. Who knows, you might learn something of the <br/>
history of an area that way, or even come across a page describing a <br/>
nearby spot that is desperately in need of a letterbox. Try it now: <br/>
just type http://www.google.com into that box at the top of your <br/>
screen! Your life will never be the same!<br/>

Seems like it was pretty far in. Just kiddin.<br/>
<br/>
I do a lot of my letterbox hunting research using Google, oops, sorry <br/>
Yahoo and many times the kind of info I'm looking for just isn't on <br/>
the "official" or even some of the unofficial sites for the <br/>
trail/area, I like the idea of being able to find some of it right in <br/>
the clue, ie dog friendly, poison ivy near the box hiding place, <br/>
really great restaurant nearby, etc. Whatever the box placer is <br/>
willing to share based on the type of box it is.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I still like to do searches and read up on an area <br/>
especially if it's someplace I haven't been before.<br/>

Would you believe that there are even some of us left<br/>
that use old-fashioned trail guidebooks? I know, hard<br/>
to believe, but true nonetheless!!<br/>

I've been known to scout out letterboxing exploits entirely based on<br/>
