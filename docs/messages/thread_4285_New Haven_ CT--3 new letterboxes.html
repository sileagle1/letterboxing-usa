Edgewood Park. The walk is very easy and child-friendly, about <br/>
30 minutes excluding stamping time. <br/>
<br/>
Edgewood Park features nature walks and a duck pond, tennis <br/>
and basketball courts, skateboarding ramps, and soccer and <br/>
Little League fields. Near the playground at the east end of the <br/>
park, the ranger station houses wildlife displays. There are <br/>
bocce courts and an enormous sundial that doubles as a <br/>
sprinkler for children in the summer. The Holocaust memorial <br/>
and Spanish American War monument are also here.<br/>
<br/>
To get to the park, take exit 59 from the Merritt Parkway. Head <br/>
towards New Haven from the exit ramp. (If you're coming from <br/>
New Haven, head out Whalley Avenue towards Westville.) Turn <br/>
south onto West Rock Avenue. There is a parking lot near the <br/>
intersection of Whalley and West Rock. Leave your car there, <br/>
near the tennis and basketball courts.<br/>
<br/>
On the paved path, walk past the tennis courts until you see a <br/>
footbridge. Cross the bridge, which spans the West River. At the <br/>
end of the bridge bear 140 degrees on the main path. You will <br/>
pass Coogan Pavilion (you can skateboard for a while if you like) <br/>
and go through the red gates. Turn left immediately and cross <br/>
the small bridge to a trail.<br/>
<br/>
You will quickly come to a Y in the trail. Turn right and go about <br/>
25 paces. Look on your left for two trees growing together. The <br/>
front tree forms a V, the back one has a large canker or bole. Box <br/>
#1 awaits you on the east side of this pair. <br/>
<br/>
After stamping in, return to the main path and continue until you <br/>
see another footbridge, this time to the right. Cross the bridge <br/>
and follow the main trail, not letting yourself be led astray by side <br/>
trails. When you reach the edge of a clearing, take a bearing of <br/>
270 degrees and turn that way.<br/>
<br/>
Your new trail is a nature trail, although some of the plaques are <br/>
missing. Persevere on this trail until you reach the shagbark <br/>
hickory plaque (which is not missing). Standing in front of this <br/>
plaque, look for a tree with a hollow center at 300 degrees. This <br/>
tree is sheltering box #2 within it. Be sure to cover the box <br/>
carefully after stamping in. Continue south on this trail to reach a <br/>
deck overlooking the marsh, where you may be able to see <br/>
some turtles. Then retrace your steps to the clearing,<br/>
<br/>
Look across the clearing to find the three Christmas trees. <br/>
Beyond these three trees, at 85 degrees from the rightmost tree, <br/>
is a tree that looks like crossed fingers. Go to this tree, being <br/>
careful of brambles. You'll probably collect a lot of sticky seeds <br/>
on your clothing. Near the base of the crossed fingers, look <br/>
through the opening between the fingers from north to south. Box <br/>
#3 is nestling under a small pile of rocks about ten paces away.<br/>
<br/>
After stamping in to this final box, return to the trail through the <br/>
clearing and head generally north, which will soon bring you <br/>
back to the parking lot. Take a moment to be amazed at the <br/>
possibilities of letterboxing in such an urban environment.<br/>
