Diamond Bar, Los Angeles County, CA<br/>
<br/>
At the nexus of the 57 and 60 freeways, you will find a relatively <br/>
newtown near the eastern end of Los Angeles County.  Formerly part of <br/>
the Spadra Ranch, it now boasts over 56,000 residents and has the <br/>
dubious distinction of being the home of the smog-czars: the South <br/>
Coast AQMD.<br/>
<br/>
Exit the 57/60 Freeway at Grand Avenue and go up the hill to Golden <br/>
Springs Blvd.  Turn left and go about  mile until you see a<br/>
Little League Field on the right.  Turn in there.  Park in the upper <br/>
lot and walk down the steps to the lower area to a path that will take <br/>
you over a wooden footbridge.  Stay on the concrete path, passing <br/>
another footbridge and an enormous Oak tree with four trunks.  125 <br/>
paces (142, if you are 12 years old) past the Oak, you'll find a <br/>
map-sign donated by the local Boy Scouts that is, well, rather useless <br/>
except for these directions.  Follow the nearby dirt trail with the <br/>
wooden fence on your left.  25 paces past the end of the fence is a <br/>
bench for resting, and then another wooden fence.  Go to the end of <br/>
that fence and take the left fork in the trail, passing the boulder <br/>
that looks like a scared turtle in a cage.  At this point, you should <br/>
stop and thank Kate for not making you walk up the trail to the right <br/>
which is where we were originally going to put the box, until she <br/>
decided it was just too hot and unshaded up there!<br/>
<br/>
Continue into the Live Oak grove left of the turtle-rock to a small <br/>
stream, which you should cross.  You will see one, and then about 50 <br/>
feet farther up stream, another fallen tree (both bridging the stream <br/>
somewhat precariously) as you head up the ravine created by the <br/>
stream.  About 100 feet beyond the second fallen tree, is a huge tree <br/>
with a V (or maybe a Y) trunk.  As you stand at its base and look <br/>
farther into the canyon, you will see another very large tree (the <br/>
biggest one there) on the opposite side of the stream with two holes <br/>
at its base.  Inside, on the left side of the western hole, is your <br/>
prize!<br/>
<br/>
Your reward should be a bucket of balls at the golf course near the <br/>
freeway.  If you are hungry, go to Sam Woo's at the 60 freeway and <br/>
Nogales Road (2 miles west) for some of the best Dim Sum you can find <br/>
anywhere.  If you prefer Italian, check out D'Antonio's on the north <br/>
end of town.<br/>

WAIVER OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLAIMER <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing, like any outdoor sport, carries the risk of unforeseen <br/>
hazards.  "Letterboxing North America" supports a policy of not <br/>
knowingly placing letterboxes in areas that will create undue risk to <br/>
the letterbox hunter.  However, as conditions may vary, it is the <br/>
responsibility of the letterbox searcher to become thoroughly<br/>
familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately <br/>
prepare for those conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and <br/>
responsibly with respect to those conditions and with respect to his <br/>
or her personal abilities and limitations.  "Letterboxing North <br/>
America" and the individual letterbox sponsors assume no liability for <br/>
events which may occur related directly or indirectly to one's <br/>
searching for a letterbox.  <br/>
