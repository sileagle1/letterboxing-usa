registrations.  You don't have to be a member of First Coast Letterboxing,<br/>
live here, or even know anyone here to join us for some fun in the sun (or<br/>
shade if that's your preference).<br/>
<br/>
Potluck lunch, event stamps, workshops, kid only boxes, permanent boxes,<br/>
event only boxes, special prizes for usual and unusual categories, raffle<br/>
for cool stuff.... and whatever else we/you can come up with - all on top of<br/>
some fellowship with other inky fingered pals.<br/>
<br/>
OH and did I mention the beach?  Yeah, the park has beach access, camping,<br/>
fishing, canoe/kayak/sailboat/paddle boat rentals, hiking and biking trails,<br/>
playgrounds and a lot fun just waiting for you.<br/>
<br/>
Come one, come all to experience spring break - First Coast Letterboxing<br/>
style!<br/>
<br/>
Registration and details are available on www.atlasquest.com.<br/>
<br/>
See you there,<br/>
