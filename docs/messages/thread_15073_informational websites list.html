&gt; Subject: Re: Database vs. Evolution<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree that change is inevitable,  As the hobby grows, the way we do<br/>
&gt; things will change, sometimes for the better, sometimes not.  But<br/>
&gt; that doesn't have to mean a change in direction, away from the spirit<br/>
&gt; of the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It has been incorrectly assumed that because folks don't want their<br/>
&gt; boxes listed in the database that they do not want to hear reports on<br/>
&gt; them.  In the majority of cases, nothing could be further from the<br/>
&gt; truth.  I love to hear reports on my boxes, and appreciate when<br/>
&gt; finders e-mail me with their successes (and non-successes).  This is<br/>
&gt; how I keep tabs on my boxes and keep up-to-date status information on<br/>
&gt; each box on the clue page.  I am fortunate to be in Michigan where<br/>
&gt; the majority of boxers don't even read the Yahoo list, so the logical<br/>
&gt; way to report they have found a box is via e-mail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It has also been incorrectly assumed that because some folks have<br/>
&gt; voiced dislike of sitreps that they do not want to hear about boxing<br/>
&gt; adventures.  I love reading fun and interesting stories such as those<br/>
&gt; reported by BeMa (and others).  The concern is reports that reveal<br/>
&gt; specifics about boxes and give away information that the seeker<br/>
&gt; intended to be part of the challenge and/or reward of finding the<br/>
&gt; box.  And then there are the reports that are just lists of boxes<br/>
&gt; found which seem that they would have been more effectively sent to<br/>
&gt; the placer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It also concerns me that when people report their box finds to the<br/>
&gt; list, that they are assuming this serves as notification to the box<br/>
&gt; placer.  Of course nobody is under any obligation to report a box<br/>
&gt; find to the placer, but many do ask to be notified via e-mail.  In<br/>
&gt; the past it wasn't always obvious how to get in touch with the<br/>
&gt; placer, so box finds were sometimes posted to the list hoping they<br/>
&gt; would see them there.  The new LbNA site makes it possible to e-mail<br/>
&gt; any box placer.  Posting to the list is not the same thing, as many<br/>
&gt; people do not read the list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It also has been thrown out a few times that perhaps the elders could<br/>
&gt; teach the newer members.  I believe that most of those clinging to<br/>
&gt; tradition have been very active in organizing events and workshops<br/>
&gt; for the letterboxing community as a whole.  Several also have web<br/>
&gt; sites that give a wealth of information and links to letterboxing<br/>
&gt; information.  But making the information and instruction available is<br/>
&gt; only half of it...  people still need to take advantage of the<br/>
&gt; learning tools that are presented.  And most of all, need to<br/>
&gt; understand that as with so many other things in life, the best<br/>
&gt; teacher is experience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This post is not meant as a flame to anyone and please do not flame<br/>
&gt; me back either on list or via personal e-mail.  I am tired of the<br/>
&gt; same people who are saying that we must respect people's opinions and<br/>
&gt; get past the negativity sending me e-mail that is negative and<br/>
&gt; disrespectful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think this thing has gone round and round and been beaten<br/>
&gt; completely to death.  I for one, will agree to disagree because the<br/>
&gt; back and forth is no fun and certainly fits nowhere into the<br/>
&gt; reasoning of why I letterbox.<br/>
