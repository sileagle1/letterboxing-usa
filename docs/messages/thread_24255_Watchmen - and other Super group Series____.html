                    <div class="plaintext-content">Anyone interested in contributing to a series based on Alan Moore's <br/>
groundbreaking graphic novel Watchmen... I have a few characters which <br/>
still need to be carved... A couple folks emailed me recently that they <br/>
are behind on their carvings and asked out of this series for now...<br/>
Soo I have a void on a couple main characters....<br/>
<br/>
I want to plant a couple series in Jun and if someone is interested in <br/>
carving a stamp or 2 I would greatly appreciate it.....<br/>
<br/>
please email me Mainekokopellian@yahoo.com<br/>
and I can give you some more info....<br/>
<br/>
I do have alot of artwork/pics that I can send to help out as well so <br/>
you wouldnt need to search out clipart....<br/>
