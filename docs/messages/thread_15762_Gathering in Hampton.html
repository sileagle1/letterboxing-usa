                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to Chuck/Chickabirdie &amp; Molly for a wonderful day.I don't know what to say that has not already been said.Letter boxers are he most delightful people that you ever want to meet,this was are 4th gathering and biggest by far.By now I figured that today was going to be easy because we already had all the exchanges for this area by now and we could just sit back and relax.(Ya Right) we picked up 49 new exchanges and stamped in 11 Hitch Hikers plus the personal travelers, event stamps and all the planted boxes we did everything but sit or relax.And I would not want it any other way it was great!! It just goes to show how much this hobby is growing,and we enjoy meeting new people and making new friends.Happy Trails,The NeeDeeps  <br/>
