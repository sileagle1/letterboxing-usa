ENCHANTED PALOS VERDES LOS ANGELES CA<br/>
We have never found the 2nd box that has clues in the first box, <br/>
three attempts but in the past many of you LB'ERS have.  If you have <br/>
found the second box please if you have a chance go back and check <br/>
it and write that you have in the first box on on the site.  Some <br/>
other folks have written that it is missing.  As it stands we have <br/>
no hope of finding it.  There are many peppertrees and some have <br/>
grown larger the one that might have been lonely may now have <br/>
buddies. If the box is really awol - then lets either make it clear <br/>
or I can make a replacement htat is if we know what it looks like <br/>
and where it goes.  I have never heard from wendy gault. I would say <br/>
taht this needs a box review and remodel I guess.<br/>

PARSONS LETTER BOX CATALINA CA <br/>
These clues are on the old site but not the new one - can any one <br/>
