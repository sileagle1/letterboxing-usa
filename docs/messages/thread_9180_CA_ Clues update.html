<br/>
We are the owners of several southern California boxes as well <br/>
as one Arizona box and one Michigan box. We run our own <br/>
server on which the clues reside, and which is going to be down <br/>
for about 2 weeks (11/21 - 12/5). The reason for this is we're <br/>
moving to Texas...<br/>
<br/>
The site is http://www.paperdance.com/letterboxing.php. If <br/>
anyone thinks they're going to be wanting the clues during that <br/>
time, print them out by end of day 11/20.<br/>
<br/>
I would post them on a free web host except I use special <br/>
scripting that these hosts don't provide (php).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks (y')all,<br/>
Karen and Rich of Team Saulsa<br/>
