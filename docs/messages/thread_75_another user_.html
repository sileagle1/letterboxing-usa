classmates home from school for lunch and play.  The day was predicted<br/>
to be wet, but warm sun and fluffy clouds were the welcome exception. <br/>
Brian is a dedicated explorer and letterboxer, he has helped me place<br/>
every box (4 and counting).   His friend Eli is a newbie.  I carved a<br/>
fish stamp to compliment the one Brian designed &amp; I carved (they are<br/>
both 5 years old, so I haven't started Brian carving yet).  I also gave<br/>
him a small notebook to record the day's finds.  He was grinning from<br/>
ear to ear when we magically found Rock Creek #1.  The new location<br/>
makes use of a wooden pull and monofilament line to retrieve the box<br/>
from inside the ... (oops... don't want to give too much away), so as<br/>
you pull the wooden toggle, the box rises out of the hole.  He was<br/>
hooked right then and there.  We went on to find Rock Creek #2 and the<br/>
others in the area (note to future travellers, right now it takes less<br/>
than an hour to find all 4... if your eyes are open &amp; you are good with<br/>
clues).  Muddy shoes, some blackberry vine scrapes and inky fingers<br/>
later (also many suggestions at every tree and rock where the next box<br/>
should go) we returned home.  I think we've got another convert!!<br/>
