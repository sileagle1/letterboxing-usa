Great Smoky Mountains National Park<br/>
Planted 11-8-2000<br/>
<br/>
Make your way to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and check <br/>
with a visitors center to find the way to the Laurel Falls trail. The <br/>
trail in total is over 4 miles up the mountains. However the falls <br/>
are only a little over a mile up the mountain. Once you get to the <br/>
falls, take a rest and some pictures. You are probably over half way <br/>
to the box. Continue up the trail past the falls to where some of the <br/>
trees get considerably bigger. Take your time to enjoy the scenery. <br/>
There you will eventually find a upside down tree cut completely in <br/>
two for you to pass through. Climb up the hill to the roots and find <br/>
your prize. This is a relatively easy trail and may be suitable for <br/>
families with children who would be reluctant to try some of the <br/>
other trails in the park. The trail up to the falls is even paved <br/>
with asphalt, but after that it is not. However, like all the <br/>
mountain trails in the park, you _must_ supervise any children <br/>
closely as the trails run along cliffs that would be dangerous or <br/>
fatal if someone were to slip and fall off. As usual, persons hunting <br/>
this letterbox do so entirely at your own risk. Enjoy!<br/>
