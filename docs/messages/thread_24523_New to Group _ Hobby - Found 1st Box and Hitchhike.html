                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone!  My family and I have been wanting to try letterboxing for <br/>
about a year now since I read about it in a magazine and checked out <br/>
the website.  Finally got around to it today and we loved the hunt!  <br/>
And of course, finding the box!  And we got another surprise when we <br/>
found a hitchhiker in the box, too...  Now I have a question...  Is <br/>
there a time limit we have to get the hitchhiker to a new location?  <br/>
And can it be either another existing box OR a new box that we plant?  <br/>
I'm not sure we're up to planting one yet, but I was just wondering.  <br/>
Anyway, we have plans to look for another local box, but am worried it <br/>
may not be there anymore because, according to the website, many of the <br/>
boxes in our area are reported missing it seems after a year or more of <br/>
hiding.  So if I get there and the box is missing, I don't know how <br/>
long it could be before we can look for another.  If it takes too long <br/>
should we put it back where we found it?  Thanks for your input!<br/>

I know there isn't a time limit.  My first hitchhiker<br/>
I held onto for awhile because we were going on<br/>
vacation and I wanted to plant it there.  Gotta love<br/>
this hobby!  It's such a rush to find the hitchhikers.<br/>
 Hope you have luck with the one's planted locally. <br/>
We've had a lot of the same problem so I started<br/>
trying to plant boxes.  Good luck.<br/>
