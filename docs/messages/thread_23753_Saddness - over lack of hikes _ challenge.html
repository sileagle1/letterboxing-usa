I would prefer that my "finds" actually indicated some effort.  I <br/>
love hiking, and would prefer more hiking boxes.  A series labeled "3 <br/>
miles" will get very few visitors, and that is a pity.<br/>
<br/>
Some geocacher/letterboxers do geocaches because the challenge is so <br/>
low for letterboxes.  What is the point of driving a long ways when <br/>
the challenge level is so low.  I think it is really sad that people <br/>
with impressive hiking credentials, now entertain themselves by <br/>
driving for an hour or more to walk 30 minutes (and score finds).<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we need a new category of letterbox.  Letterboxing has more <br/>
potential than geocaching, because it has no rules or limits, yet it <br/>
fails to live up to its' potential.<br/>

PS Letterboxing is kind of like drinking coffee.  It is so good at <br/>
first &amp; highly addicting.  Later, you have to drink coffee just to <br/>
have normal brain function.  (BTW - I love being addicted to <br/>
coffee.)  Now people get their letterboxing experience without the <br/>
joy it once held.<br/>

There are bigger issues in the world. Nobody is dying, going hungry, <br/>

anyone heard the saying "Can't we all just get along"?  <br/>
