                    <div class="plaintext-content">Take a deep breath everyone.  There is tension in the air right now.<br/>
I'm at fault too.  I've had a side-bar going with some of the technical people<br/>
in which I have been overly emotional lately.  There's enough strife going on in<br/>
the world right now.  Let's try our best to keep our little piece of peace<br/>
here.  Its been really nice in that regard.  I see nothing wrong with chastising<br/>
the guy who came in with the political statements recently.  I took him off the<br/>
list as he requested.  <br/>
<br/>
Recently I have become disenchanted with Adrian also because I felt that we were<br/>
being blamed for some of the squabbles they are having over in Dartmoor.  But I<br/>
want to remind everyone (myself included) that this is an open list.  If people<br/>
are comfortable with Adrian or some anarchist (or yes, even a libertarian Mitch)<br/>
then let's keep the faith that whatever issues beset us will be ironed out.  I<br/>
just want to say that I feel deeply comitted to the idea of the open forum in<br/>
which everyone is valued and can participate at the level they are most<br/>
comfortable. <br/>
<br/>
So let's figure this out together.  Let's keep it fun, and let's keep the<br/>
discussions healthy and robust without defaming anyone's character.<br/>
Personally, my main hope is that this not be a spring-board for whining and<br/>
complaining whether about political views or letterbox issues - that it would<br/>
mainly be a forum for constructive input to make letterboxing more fun, more<br/>
participative and more interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for hanging in there with the group all you who are still hanging in<br/>
there with us.<br/>

As for Adrian... I know his comments might be taken roughly, but I for<br/>
one welcome his input.  I imagine he has lost more than a few<br/>
letterboxing associates because of his help in creating the article in<br/>
The Smithsonian Magazine.  I hope he can get a little solace from the<br/>
knowledge that his contributions have caused this group to come<br/>
together.  I don't believe that we have "taken over", but our efforts at<br/>
organization via internet have been pretty successful.  Maybe not<br/>
exactly as they do it in Dartmoor... but in a way that seems to work on<br/>
this side of the pond.<br/>
<br/>
After that deep breath that Daniel is proposing, pat yourselves on the<br/>
back for helping perpetuate a hobby that crosses borders in peace and is<br/>
the opitomy of sharing and giving.<br/>
<br/>
Merry Christmas and a safe and prosperous New Year to you all<br/>
