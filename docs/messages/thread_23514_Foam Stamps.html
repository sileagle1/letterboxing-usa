I was perusing the aisles at my local Micheal's crafts store, and was <br/>
struck by an inspiration... FOAM STAMPS!! I'm sure this has come up <br/>
before as this is most likely not a very original idea, but has anyone <br/>
dabbled with creating foam stamps for their letterboxes? I just moved <br/>
to a new town, and am planning on planting some boxes in my new home.  <br/>
I thought this would be a good time to start experimenting with foam.  <br/>
Does anyone have any tips or suggestions? Foam seems to be a cheaper <br/>
and more common medium than the speedy cut or staedler material. <br/>
Thanks! <br/>

I'm holding a piece of foam in my hand now and tried a 'gouger'<br/>
(Speedball tool) on it and it doesn't work.  Except for cutting out<br/>
basic shapes, I cannot imagine getting a delightful stamp from such<br/>
material.  Haven't tried its ability to accept and transfer stamp pad<br/>
ink.  I have used the thicker 1/4" foam for backing stamps and that<br/>
works nice.<br/>
<br/>
Suggest if you need less costly carving medium to check out the PZ Kut<br/>
(orange or white - I like both). <br/>

  I've seen foam stamps in a couple of boxes,  They work fine, nice images and seem to hold up at least a year+.  But you wouldn't be able to use foam if you were making a stamp with very small details.  That's where the carving media come in.<br/>

There are some definate applications for foam stamp. You probably won't be able to create a stamp with intricate details but with a little creativity, you could probably make some really fun boxes.<br/>
<br/>
AC Moore (and probably other arts and craft stores) actually sells some stamps that are two pieces and are made from foam. They are mounted on very thin sheets of plexiglas. One I can think of off the top of my head is a tree. The stump and branches are one piece and the leaves are the second piece. It looks really nice when it is stamped.<br/>

Foam stamps seem to samp nice clean images and hold up pretty well, but <br/>
they would be difficult for more intricate stamp images.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing they are great for is kids. Kids can make all sorts of <br/>
simple stamps out of them using just a pair of scissors. I have <br/>
suggested such stamp making to scout leaders who really seem to like the <br/>
idea.<br/>
