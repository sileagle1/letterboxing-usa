Chillicothe, Ross County, Ohio. Difficulty: Easy. Placed 4-13-03 by <br/>
Salamander. CLUES: Go to the multi-use campground area (First left <br/>

which marks the Sugarloaf Mtn., Shawnee Ridge, &amp; Mt. Ives trails. <br/>
Standing in front of the sign,take a reading of 337 degrees and go 22 <br/>
paces to a spot in front of a small wooden bench. From here, take 11 <br/>
paces at 285 degrees. Stop. Down the slope in front of you, and <br/>
slightly to the right, you should see a large rock. Go to that rock. <br/>
Standing at its south side, take a reading of 52 degrees. Go 6 paces <br/>
at that heading to an uprooted and fallen tree. Follow along the <br/>
length of the tree to its N/NW end. The box is wedged against the <br/>
base of a smaller tree which is growing up between a fork in the end <br/>
of the fallen tree.<br/>
