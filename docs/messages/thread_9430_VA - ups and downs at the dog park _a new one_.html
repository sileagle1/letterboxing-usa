It was an afternoon of ups and downs at the dog park.  We decided to try and <br/>
new one (up) even though it was a little cold (down).  It was located a <br/>
couple of blocks from a good friend's house (up).  They weren't home (down). <br/>
  Found Glencaryln easily (up).  Ran into (figuratively speaking) a guy who <br/>
made us back way up on that little skinny road before he would pass (down).  <br/>
Note -- it is a really skinny one lane two way road with kind of blind turns <br/>
-- honk or go very slowly and hope others do the same!  Met some other <br/>
letterboxers in the parking lot (up).  Didn't get the exchange -- again -- <br/>
(down).  They said they found the box and so we figured we would too as we <br/>
were still reeling from our Froggy mishaps (up).  Dog park had no fence or <br/>
enclosure so pup couldn't be let off the leash (she isn't too good at coming <br/>
yet...) (down).  Started on the way to the letterbox and made it down the <br/>
path, to the fallen trees, up the hill, onto the stony path (hiding under <br/>
all those leaves), through the two big trees, to the left and to the big <br/>
tree on the right (up). Dug and poked everywhere and didn't find the box <br/>
(waaaaaaaay doooooooown).  We think we are in a rut.  There wasn't one <br/>
little log left unturned 'cause Mom BeMa was really determined this time.  <br/>
Everyone else sat and waited while Mom rooted all around, to the gulley and <br/>
back.  Heavy sigh....  BeMa<br/>
