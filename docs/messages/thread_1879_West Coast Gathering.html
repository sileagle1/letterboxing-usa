I believe we are booked for April 28th at the Interpretive Center.  I would<br/>
like to find out if we can use the facilities to host our gathering along<br/>
with their Earth Day festivities.  I know they have a kitchen and large<br/>
meeting room.  They also have a separate building with similar facilities<br/>
that is nearing completion.<br/>
<br/>
End of April weather could be damp... probably in the high 50's to low 60's.<br/>
It is a great time to be in the Pacific NW.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, the Tualatin Hills Nature Park is in Beaverton.  I think Mitch and Thom<br/>
live out that way.  I'm on the Central East side,   conveniently located<br/>
between the airport and downtown Portland.  If you know where<br/>
Hollywood/Laurelhurst is, that's where I stay.  I also spend a lot of time<br/>
in the Menlo Park area where my mate, John, resides.  We are looking forward<br/>
to the gathering!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

Hmmm, never been to the west coast myself. This would be a great excuse to<br/>
get out there. I am interested of course. Heck, i'm interested in Hawaii<br/>
too!<br/>
