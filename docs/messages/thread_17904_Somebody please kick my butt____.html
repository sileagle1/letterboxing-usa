<br/>
My son and I went LBxing in Joshua Tree, CA this weekend to <br/>
find the only box in that area. We were so good at following all <br/>
the clues and excited because we knew we were close....until I <br/>
got to the bottom of my clues printout and noticed "page 1 of 2." I <br/>
DIDN'T GET PAGE 2 OFF THE PRINTER!<br/>
<br/>
Even though we searched the area, we didn't find the box. Now <br/>
that I've retrieved the clues again, I know exactly where it is. Oh <br/>
well, guess we'll have to return and try again....like we need an <br/>
excuse to visit such a paradise!<br/>

I did that!   I'd driven a couple of hours to do some boxes, and was trying <br/>
desperately to squeeze one in before the sun when down.   I was covering <br/>
ground, passing clues, until suddenly I realized I didn't have page two!   Oh well.  <br/>
 It gave me an excuse to go back to that nature center (which was a really <br/>
nice one) and take more time as I went down the trail.<br/>

Yeah, you want dumb, try this one!  I took a letterbox up a strenuous <br/>
eight mile hike to hide it, but forgot the stamp that went with it!  <br/>
*shaking head*  It was one of the lowest moments of my life....<br/>
<br/>
I ended up hiding the box anyway and instead of posting a clue, I <br/>
said anyone that wanted to find the box had to contact me first and <br/>
they would have to replant the stamp with the letterbox when they <br/>
went to look for it.<br/>
<br/>
You think I'm done?  Ha!  Then, about a week later, I found the <br/>
missing stamp in with all my letterboxing gear--the same gear I had <br/>
hiked up the darned mountain with in the first place.  Turns out, I <br/>
had the stamp the whole time!  *rolling eyes*<br/>
<br/>
I thought I had hit rock bottom, but after that I knew there never <br/>
was such a thing.  =)<br/>
