They had mounted their stamp to the top of the stamp pad.  It was a <br/>
small stamp so they had mounted it to one of those small pads you can <br/>

I've seen people do this too, but there was a problem that they<br/>

replacable, so they were stuck with a stamp on a dry pad that took up<br/>

<br/>
That's why I mounted it to a removable lid, not the hinge kind. That<br/>
way you could just use the top on another ink pad and not have to<br/>
worry about lugging around the dry one.<br/>
