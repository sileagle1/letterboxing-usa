We can tell you there are not very many in British Columbia, in fact we<br/>
followed one around last week - note was made in one box saying someone had<br/>
planned to drop off a HH but that the box was too small, ( might be a tad<br/>
difficult to drop one off in a micro box !! ) later we came across another<br/>
box - with a message saying they had picked up a HH and were taking it to<br/>
Virginia, USA ! I think that is the cool part - a rubber stamp being packed<br/>
around, from country to country. Hey ! that is one question never asked at<br/>
the border isn't it? " Are you packing a Hitch Hiker ? "<br/>

person who brought a BC hitchhiker (the Rambling Rose) to VA was me! It was my 
first and only HH and I was excited to find it. I also left a HH of my own 
making in one of the BC boxes--the HH was called the Flying Piglet--but I 
haven't heard whether anyone has found it and sent it on its way. Did you see if 
if was picked up? I'd love to know.</span></div>
