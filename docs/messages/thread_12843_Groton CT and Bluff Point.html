stamp at Elaine and Jerry's Bluff to be missing, even though it has <br/>
been missing for several months based on the log book (which has had <br/>
many non-LB entries).   Does anyone know who owns this box? The new <br/>
Web Site does not have an owner.   I'll volunteer to adopt it and <br/>
carve a stamp for it.... possibly even a slight move considering how <br/>
VERY public this spot is.....<br/>

We got the Avery Light mystery box today and tried for "Two Labs and <br/>
a Box" but had no idea what trail its on and decided to head back <br/>
and get some lunch (no open restrooms tends to make you plan <br/>
accordingly!) I'm thinking I will have to take the Mountain Bike <br/>
down there and look for that box....<br/>
<br/>
LOTS of ticks if you go to get the Bluff Series, both dog and deer <br/>
ticks...<br/>

&gt; Does anyone know who owns [the Elaine and Jerry's Bluff] box?<br/>
<br/>
This box was placed by the EMS Waterford staff, June '98.  I believe<br/>
it was the first one they placed, and thus the first in CT (post<br/>
Smithsonian era), but I would have to check my records to confirm that.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I found that box, there were 37 entries in the logbook,<br/>
which was a staggering amount in those days.  It was prolly more than<br/>
entries then in all other logbooks around the country combined.  <br/>
<br/>
Hand carved stamps were extremely rare in those days, especially in<br/>
CT.  I'd have to check if was hand carved -- if someone wants a scan,<br/>
e-mail me, as it might be worth carving a replacement as it is a<br/>
historic box.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

        I think it was the 2nd box.  #1 was Misery Loves Company.  It was<br/>
the also the<br/>
        2nd box Dan and I found way back in April of 1999.  Before we even<br/>
had Max!<br/>

<br/>
        Yes, we didn't find a hand carved stamp until Jay's Mamacoke Island<br/>
which<br/>
        we found in March 2000.  I remember thinking " Wow he made this out<br/>
of an eraser?!"<br/>
        Of course the abundance of store bought stamps in the beginning is<br/>
the reason Dan<br/>
        and I had store bought signature stamps for so long.  It was hard to<br/>
give them up!<br/>
<br/>
        The original Elaine and Jerry's Bluff stamp was a store bought<br/>
flower- I think a sunflower-<br/>
        but then I don't really know my flowers.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, with much prodding via emails... and unless I hear from the <br/>
Waterford EMS staff... I'll recarve and replace Elain and Jerry's <br/>
Bluff.   I'll give it one week for someone to speak up if he or she <br/>
originally placed the box and then I'll have the web masters assign <br/>
it to me.   Deal??  If anyone has a scan of it, please send it over <br/>
to me.... its Shol3039@yahoo.com  <br/>
<br/>
If it is indeed a store bought stamp, them maybe I will take poetic <br/>
license and butcher up a custom eraser!  LOL   I'm also going to <br/>
change the locale just a bit because the path is sooooo worn and its <br/>
obvious to anyone that that pyramid rock has some significance.. and <br/>
there were many non-LB write ins. Just happens at popular <br/>
locations.  I was thinking of carving a blank sign post...with no <br/>
sign... to commemorate the DEP's abandonment of this gem of a state <br/>
park! (Grin)  <br/>
