                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too had a great time at Sleeping Giant Saturday meeting boxers from <br/>
our own backyard as well as out of staters.   Of course I think we <br/>
all have to be a little bit 'out of state' to be letterboxers!  We <br/>
enjoyed hunting with Ginger and John in the morning while catching up <br/>
with Butterfly and her group.  After the noontime fest and stamp <br/>
exchange frolic, Deanne and I decided to hit a quieter trail in the <br/>
afternoon and were delighted to find Aili's artful Merlin's Grotto.  <br/>
Terrible at remembering names and faces, adding a letterbox handle <br/>
made this even more challenging for me. So if we meet again, forgive <br/>
me if I need another introduction.  However, I know that I too missed <br/>
exchanging stamps with some that I thought I had gotten.  Hope there <br/>
will always be a next time. <br/>
<br/>
Most of all I want to thank Aili and Bruce for their faithful <br/>
presence throughout the day - Without them we would have been lost.<br/>
