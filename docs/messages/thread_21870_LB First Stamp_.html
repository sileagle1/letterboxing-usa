The practice you describe about placing the box's stamp in the log that is in the box is correct. At least that is what I do. And, I believe almost every box I have found has this also.<br/>

two years ago, and then I quickly forgot the name.  After some time <br/>
I searched it, but could never get the name right.  About 6 months <br/>
ago a friend mentioned geo-caching and I asked her about something <br/>
similar with stamps.  She had, so I was back on track.  <br/>
<br/>
I've hit nearly everything locally with my 4 year old son.  I did a <br/>
Scooby Doo series for his forth birthday which he loved.  I've <br/>
planted nearly as many as I've found and I'm hosting the Mid-MO LB <br/>

Saturday.  I'll let you in on a little secret, my P count is about <br/>
to explode!<br/>

I've also participated in several LB exchanges through the mail <br/>
which I enjoy greatly.  I like the idea of my boxes being here-there-<br/>

I usually make a "cover page" on the front of the log with the "box <br/>
stamp" just to give it an identity.  Then stamp my personal stamp on <br/>
the first page with "planted by" and the date (keep in mind that <br/>
the "clues" also have the planters ID in them). However, there is <br/>
no "wrong" way, each placer has their own personal way of doing things <br/>
and every box has its own uniqueness.  That is part of the fun of this <br/>
hobby! <br/>
<br/>
welcome! and happy hunting! <br/>

There's nothing wrong with putting the box's stamp in the box's<br/>
logbook.   Imagine that the previous visitor to a box left a<br/>
hitch-hiker.  Now imagine that you're bringing a hitch-hiker to leave<br/>
in the box.  Now imagine that you're with 2 or 3 kids.  If nothing<br/>
else, having the stamp image in the logbooks helps keep it straight<br/>
which stamp stays with which logbook.<br/>

P.S. My personal stamp is the second image to go in every logbook I<br/>
plant.  Go for it!<br/>

*your* letterbox, right?  So fret not.<br/>
<br/>
I've been letterboxing for about five years now, and have placed over <br/>
30 boxes.  When I was ready to create my first logbook, I asked <br/>
myself "if I were finding this letterbox, what would I want to see as <br/>
the intro to the logbook?".  Here is what I came up with, and it works <br/>
for me:<br/>
<br/>
I usually use 3x5 wirebound index cards as logbooks.  I "X" out the <br/>
front cover and flip the logbook over so that the back cover is now the <br/>
front cover and the pages are blank (not lined).<br/>
<br/>
On the outside of the logbook, I write the name of the letterbox.  On <br/>
the first page, I stamp the letterbox's image and note the name of the <br/>
letterbox, the date it was planted, and the location where it was <br/>
planted.<br/>
<br/>
On the second page, I write a short intro as to the "why" of the box <br/>
(the reason why I created this particular letterbox - to showcase a <br/>
particular view, in honor of the historic location, you get the idea), <br/>
then I stamp my signature stamp and sign my trail name and also write <br/>
down my email address.<br/>
<br/>
I do this because this is the way I want to "greet" the finders of the <br/>
box.  It's my way of saying "Hello!  I'm glad you are here.  Let me <br/>
introduce myself and tell you why I think this spot is so special.  I'm <br/>
so happy to share this bit of myself with you."<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess the question is "how do you want to say hello?".<br/>

my stash to jazz up the cover a bit if possible. Then I stamp my sig <br/>
stamp inside with the date and planted by and maybe a bit of info <br/>
about why I decided to plant a stamp there or if the stamp has a <br/>
certain significance to the place.<br/>
