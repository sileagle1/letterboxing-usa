<br/>
Ah ha!  We are going to plant a dozen boxes or so at our Area Girl Guide<br/>
Camp.  The girls range from ages 5 to 18 and we hope to include some<br/>
challenges in the boxes as well.  It might be a lesson on the local flora<br/>
and fauna, or some bit of camp skill.  Children can carve stamps out of<br/>
potatoes or soap for the camp if possible, but the girls can also bring in<br/>
stamps when the program is explained to them.  Ten or twelve year olds can<br/>
sit still long enough to carve their own stamps, I should think.<br/>
<br/>
This is going to be fun!<br/>
<br/>

session.  A local girl scout had done her silver award project on <br/>
letterboxing which included planting several boxes at one of the Girl <br/>

property).  I have taken my troop to that camp to search as well as <br/>
to some letterboxes in our hometown.  The girls made stamps out of <br/>
fun foam.  They either used precut fun foam shapes by themselves or <br/>
in combination together to create a design.  Or they cut their own.  <br/>
We then glued the fun foam to wooden blocks.  They made journals from <br/>
recylced cookie boxes with papers tied in.  They had a great time.  I <br/>
have told several other scout leaders (boy scouts as well) about the <br/>
pasttime which is great for teaching the kids orienteering.  We have <br/>
also planted boxes when we have gone camping for a weekend so they <br/>
are in the immediate area for the girls to find.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Three years ago, Emma B (Elements of Hiking) planted a series boxes at <br/>
a Girl Scout Camp, and made up two different sets of clues, one <br/>
written for older girls, one for younger girls. The clue set for older <br/>
girls was more challenging, though they led to the same boxes. Those <br/>
"in the know" (you have to know to ask) can get copies of the clues <br/>
from the Council Office.<br/>
<br/>
However, no one is allowed to just "show up" at Camp. Troops must <br/>
submit a form to Council stating the when &amp; why, and they inform the <br/>
Resident Ranger to expect you &amp; let you in.<br/>
<br/>
I know of other Girl Scouts who have planted series, too, but have not <br/>
had the opportunity to search them out.<br/>

Gosh it has been a long time but I know you must earn the right to <br/>
use a pocket knife as a GS. So unless that is apart of your program <br/>
you'll have some that can use a knife and some that cannot <br/>

(meeting on a weekend at camp) that I would just buy a few stamps of<br/>

fun finding a store bought stamp I would think.<br/>
Maybe have a stamp carving class at a different time. But I don't think<br/>
I would turn a Girlscout loose with an  Exacto knife with a # 11 blade<br/>

Maybe make little journals that they can keep for the future when they<br/>
letterbox ,or fancy logs to go in a letterbox.<br/>
