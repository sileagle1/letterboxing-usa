Apparently, they had a glich in their systems that was blocking some servers from accessing the letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com sites (same host company), and they were working on it.

I can access the pages, but i cannot login on letterboxing.org.  <br/>
Anyone have any thoughts on why that is?  I even requested a new <br/>
password thinking I wasn't remembering the password, but even the <br/>
new random one assigned to me didn't work.  :(<br/>

Yeah, I am having troubles also. I can open clue pages at <br/>
letterboxing.org but I can't add finds to my account. I click on the <br/>
flag, add the info. and then get this message:<br/>

Try atlasquest again or email the webmaster.  I was having trouble <br/>
registering yesterday and I emailed the webmaster and he fixed the <br/>
problem in a jiffy. It was code related.<br/>

That is a programming error, since the MemberID isn't being included<br/>
in the list of values.  Probably, I suspect because you aren't really<br/>
logged in so there is no member ID to put in there.  Regardless, it's<br/>
something the webmaster should be able fix, though they folks running<br/>
letterboxing.org actually have a day job, so it might take them a bit<br/>
longer to get around to fixing it.  ;o)  Just be patient, though, I'm<br/>
sure it'll get fixed!<br/>

That's it!  I'll make sure you have troubles the next time you log<br/>

Just kidding.  Less you really want me to make it more of a challenge<br/>
