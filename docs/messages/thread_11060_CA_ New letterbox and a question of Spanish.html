The clue is in my best Spanish immitation.  It may not be perfect, <br/>
but it should be readable!  At least if you know any Spanish.  =)  <br/>
You could try an online translator to see what pops out.  My opinion <br/>
of the one I tried is that it makes the clue even funnier than it was <br/>
before.  =)<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to use the word 'letterbox' in Spanish, which none of my <br/>
dictionaries has, so I tried making up my own word for lack of a <br/>
better idea.  Taking the fact that it's a compound word of 'letter' <br/>
and 'box', I get the Spanish equivelent of 'carta' and 'caja'.  In <br/>
Spanish it seems all of their compound words always have two <br/>
characteristics: They are ALWAYS plurl and they are always feminine.  <br/>
Thus, can opener is 'abrelatas' (abre=open, latas=cans) and bodyguard <br/>
is 'guardaespaldas' (guarda=guard, espaldas=backs).  And so on.<br/>
<br/>
Since I already have two nouns that are already feminine, it's just a <br/>
matter of choosing which should come first and which should be last <br/>
(and plurlized).  I kind of see the 'letter' part of the word as an <br/>
adjective describing what kind of box we're talking about (we talk <br/>
about BOXES all the time, but we never talk about 'letters' on this <br/>
board!), thus using the normal grammer in Spanish of the adjective <br/>
coming after the noun, we get cajacartas.  I've never invented a new <br/>
word before, and this is really exciting for me!  =)  <br/>
<br/>
Naturally, we need to turn cajacartas into a verb, but this is a bit <br/>
trickier.  To say that one is letterboxing, we frequently shorten it <br/>
to say that someone is 'boxing'.  Boxing would clearly be cajando in <br/>
Spanish (caja + r to turn it into a verb, and turned into an -ing <br/>
word drops the r but adds ando).  But then how would one <br/>
say 'letterboxing'?  Since 'carta' comes after 'caja' in cajacartas, <br/>
we could say we were cajacartando, which really doesn't sound too <br/>
good and I find difficult to say.  But then shortening it by dropping <br/>
the first half of the word leaves us with 'cartar', which isn't the <br/>
same as 'cajar' which I've already decided is a great way to say 'to <br/>
box'.  It's a perplexing question beyond the limited scope of my <br/>
Spanish abilities, but I'm inclined to say the verb for "to box" <br/>
is 'cajar' and "boxing" would therefore be 'cajando'.  It rolls off <br/>
the tongue really well that way!  And then add the restriction that <br/>
there is no equivelent of 'LETTERboxing' in Spanish, just 'boxing'.<br/>
<br/>
So what do all you other Spanish speaking folks out there think?  =)<br/>

I'm not sure I'd go to the effort of creating "bilingual" clues <br/>
myself--I just thought a couple of Spanish clues would give an <br/>
interesting flavor to the usual sorts of clues out there.  Anyhow, <br/>
doesn't everyone in California already know Spanish?  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I tried "letter box" on Alta Vista's translation service and came <br/>
&gt; up with "caja de letra" and it says that letra and carta both mean<br/>
&gt; letter.<br/>
<br/>
I considered that as a possible translation, but to me that <br/>
means "box of letters", which is clearly NOT the same <br/>
as "letterbox".  The former could mean the box was full of letters or <br/>
it was actually made of letters, neither of which seems like a good <br/>
translation to me.  Keeping the word a compound word seemed like the <br/>
best solution which is why I suggested cajacarta.<br/>
<br/>
As for the letra vs. carta thing, there is a HUGE difference between <br/>
the two in Spanish.  'Letra' does mean letter--as in the letters of <br/>
the alphebet.  'Carta' means letter--but as the kind of thing that <br/>
one writes to another person and drops in the mailbox.  So yes, they <br/>
both mean letter, but they have very different meanings and cannot be <br/>
used interchangeably!  I always associated the "letter" <br/>
in "letterbox" as a message one person leaves for another, thus I <br/>
used 'carta' instead of 'letra'.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Personally, I've had problems with the answers I got back on this<br/>
&gt; service sometimes (made my neighbor howl with laughter at one<br/>
&gt; paragraph).<br/>
<br/>
They really are a hoot, though.  I've had a lot of fun playing with <br/>
those translators!  And while its translations are something less <br/>
than perfect, it's usually "good enough" for someone reading it to <br/>
figure out what it's really trying to say.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Isn't Spanish fun?!  =)  Why it took me so long to get into it I'll <br/>
never know.  *rolling eyes*  Actually, I do, but that's another <br/>
story....<br/>

<p>BeMa planted a box entitled "Universal Language" in VA.  Its clues are in several different languages (can't say which ones -- that's part of the puzzle!)  There are numerous free translating programs available on the WEB to help.  Some of the most fun is seeing what strange interpretations the software comes up with!  BeMa</p>
<p> </p>
<p>P.S.  According to the Washington Post (and Hollywood...)  Spanglish is the next cool thing.  They are sprinkling it increasingly in TV and movies to add a "cool" factor.  All I can say is the more languages you know -- the more interesting conversations you can eaves-drop in on while waiting in line....</p></div>

By all means, go for it!  I didn't mean to sound discouraging, but I <br/>
personally am too lazy to create the same set of clues twice using <br/>
two differenent languages simply to forment interest in letterboxing <br/>
in the Spanish speaking community.  I'm not fluent in Spanish, and <br/>
writing a clue in Spanish is a LOT of effort for me.  Heck, it took <br/>
me over a month to write the clue in Spanish that I did do from the <br/>
time I hid it!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Wouldn't you like to go hunting in Costa Rica?  I would! <br/>
<br/>
Well you're in luck!  I've hidden a dozen boxes or so in Central <br/>
America--including Costa Rica--that are easily accessible and fun to <br/>
get!  There's a couple more that someone else hid before me that I <br/>
never got a chance to get mostly because I was too cheap to stay in <br/>
the motel it was at or to ride anything but public transportation so <br/>
it didn't work out.  When you get used to those $3/night hotel rooms, <br/>
the $70/night ones comes with a bit of sticker shock!<br/>
<br/>
However, all my clues for boxes in Central America are written in <br/>
English, primarily for those tourists visiting the area and want to <br/>
go letterboxing.  The intended audience was NOT the locals, although <br/>
I certainly don't mind if they try looking for them either!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of audience, even though the clue for the letterbox I hid is <br/>
in Spanish, the intended audience are really gringos that only speak <br/>
English.  I thought it would be fun to hear about what efforts they <br/>
go to in order to get the clue translated into English.  Something <br/>
different from the norm.  *shrug*  But of course Spanish-speaking <br/>
individuals are welcome to hunt for the box as well.  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; That's "Spanglish" to you, chico, at least in LA. ;)<br/>
<br/>
There's an idea--maybe I should try writing a clue or two in <br/>
Spanglish!  ;o)<br/>

critical.  My usually charming demeanor doesn't always<br/>

<br/>
These are all just random comments on what the word<br/>
should be and the grammar to be used.<br/>
<br/>
-The word for mailbox is "buzon"  <br/>
-To convert it into a verb would be "buzonear" (I<br/>
belive that as of a  certain year all new verbs in<br/>
Spanish are -ar verbs as decided by the royal academy<br/>
of language in Spain)<br/>
<br/>
-words or ideas taht come from other languages often<br/>
maintain the same name or get changed slightly.<br/>
<br/>
-Likely translations for "to letterbox" once explained<br/>
would be "hacer letterbox" or "letterboxear"<br/>
<br/>
-good guess on cajacartas vs. cartacajas.  one would<br/>
probably imply putting letters in boxes the other<br/>
woudl imply labeling boxes (probably)<br/>
<br/>
-Letterboxing as a term would shift depending on<br/>
whether or not it was being used as a noun or a verb. <br/>
Nouns usually are infinitives or have different<br/>
suffixes.<br/>
When used as a part of a verb in the a progressive<br/>
tense it would take the suffix -ando but would tend to<br/>
refer to the action itself as it was in progress.<br/>
<br/>
-I enjoy letterboxing (the activity)<br/>

me gusta cajacartar, me gusta cartacajamiento, me<br/>
gusta letterboxear, me gusta hacer letterbox, me gusta<br/>
buzonear, me gusta buzoneamiento.<br/>

-I was letterboxing (past progressive tense to<br/>
describe what you were doing) could be:<br/>
<br/>
yo estaba cartacajando, yo estaba letterboxeando, yo<br/>
estaba haciendo letterbox, yo estaba buzoneando.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, I would suggest using "hacer letterbox"<br/>
or "letterboxear" as they seem less contrived.  I<br/>
think it would still be appropriate to refer to the<br/>
"caja" once it was established that one was talking<br/>
about letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
On a side note, buzonear sounds pretty bad, cajar also<br/>
runs the risk of being confused with the verb "cagar"<br/>
or "cagarse" which would be a vulgar way of describing<br/>
the act of defecation.  <br/>
<br/>
compound words are generally formed by a noun and a<br/>
verb.  WHile they appear to be feminine and plural. <br/>
They always take the masculine singular article. <br/>
There are some that appear to be masculine and plural<br/>
but are still masculine singular.<br/>
<br/>
i.e.  <br/>
<br/>
el lavaplatos  (the plate washer)<br/>
el sacapuntos   (the point getter, pencil sharpener)<br/>
el sacacorchos   (the cork remover, corkscrew)<br/>
el abrelatas     (the can opener)<br/>
<br/>
Hope I have been helpful.  If you would like I can<br/>
take a look at the clues when I get a chance.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't take any of the suggestions too hard as<br/>
they are just that.  I think it's great that you chose<br/>
to do this!!!<br/>

The first English-Chinese translator was finally finished.  To give it one<br/>
final test, the phrase "Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind" was entered, translated,<br/>
then translated back into English.  It came back "Invisible, Insane"<br/>
<br/>

&gt; would be "hacer letterbox" or "letterboxear"<br/>
<br/>
Gadzooks, I suppose that is a real possibility, but I cringe at the <br/>
thought!  However, if a letterbox is a "cajacartas", I'm okay with <br/>
the idea of saying "to letterbox" as "hacer cajacartas".  But I <br/>
cringe that the thought of not Spanish-izing the word because it <br/>
seems wrong not to make an effort to have it look and sound Spanish.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; -The word for mailbox is "buzon"  <br/>
&gt; -To convert it into a verb would be "buzonear"<br/>
<br/>
I guess you have a point there as well, but that just doesn't *sound* <br/>
right to me.  Does that make any sense?  The kind of thing an online <br/>
translator would spit out because it was translating too literally.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I belive that as of a  certain year all new verbs in<br/>
&gt; Spanish are -ar verbs as decided by the royal academy<br/>
&gt; of language in Spain<br/>
<br/>
Now that is REALLY fascinating.  I wonder where we could learn more <br/>
about that.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; compound words are generally formed by a noun and a<br/>
&gt; verb.  WHile they appear to be feminine and plural. <br/>
&gt; They always take the masculine singular article. <br/>
<br/>
*hehe*  I was wondering if somebody would catch me on that.  I'd have <br/>
used a verb if I was inventing a new word from scratch (even my "can <br/>
opener" example had 'abre', a verb, as the first part of the word).  <br/>
Probably like "cazacajas" (boxhunter).  Although, if we do "veralize" <br/>
cajar, then cajacartas WOULD have the first half of the compound word <br/>
a verb while the last half is a noun.  I never considered that idea, <br/>
but that way it really does fit the verb-noun form of the typical <br/>
Spanish compound word!  <br/>
<br/>
I didn't mean to imply that compounds words in Spanish actually were <br/>
feminine and plural, but rather they looked it.  <br/>
<br/>
Didn't know about any masculine-looking compound words, though, so <br/>
that's good to know!  Although it wouldn't have made a difference in <br/>
that case.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hope I have been helpful.  If you would like I can<br/>
&gt; take a look at the clues when I get a chance.<br/>
<br/>
No, that's alright.  If you're really bored and want to, go right <br/>
ahead--I can learn a lot from someone pointing out the mistakes I <br/>
made!--but you're probably a busy person and I wouldn't want to <br/>
inconvience you to proofread my clue.  While I know darned well there <br/>
are plenty of grammatical errors in the clue, I also know darned well <br/>
that anyone who knows their Spanish shouldn't have much trouble <br/>
figuring out what I meant to say!  =)  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">yeah, buzonear sounds pretty hideous.  Usually though<br/>
words that deal with ideas, activities and concepts<br/>
from other countries don't change too much, especially<br/>
newer concepts and vocabulary that deals with new<br/>
technology.  The pronunciation changes when said with<br/>
a spanish accent, and on some occasions the spelling<br/>
changes.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess some examples are:<br/>
<br/>
surfear<br/>
hacer snowboard<br/>
karate<br/>
sushi<br/>
canguru (kangaroo)<br/>
hacer windsurf<br/>
pasaporte<br/>
skateboard<br/>
boxeo (boxing)  also pugilismo (pugilism)<br/>
genres of music, jazz, blues, punk, metal, rock<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm probably just thinking about this too<br/>
much. because I'm a Spanish teacher and I'm wrapping<br/>
up a Master's degree in linguistics and intercultural<br/>
communication.  In the grand scheme of things, it's<br/>
really not a big deal anyway.  So long as you change<br/>
it to letterboxear :)  Just kidding. <br/>
