Before you touch, pick or even consider eating any wild mushroom, you should<br/>
take a course in identification.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree wholeheartedly about eating wild mushrooms...after an entire<br/>
graduate school course in Mycology there are really only about three species<br/>
I would trust myself to identify properly and eat from the wild. The one<br/>
thing, though, that I disagree with is regarding TOUCHING mushrooms.<br/>
Touching, picking etc of mushrooms will never hurt you or your children. The<br/>
toxins in poisonous mushrooms do not work that way. You actually have to<br/>
ingest the mushroom. Even touching one and licking your fingers will NOT<br/>
harm you. My professor in grad school emphasized this vividly by putting an<br/>
Amanita virosa (Destroying Angel) in his mouth, chewing it up and spitting<br/>
it out. He really wanted people to understand that mushrooms would not hurt<br/>
you in that way...so that people would not be frightened by mushrooms in<br/>
that way. As a naturalist, I find people are often very frightened about<br/>
touching mushrooms, but apart from actually eating them, there is little to<br/>
worry about.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, regarding edible mushrooms, wild or not, whenever you try a new<br/>
species, you should only try a small amount, since even the most delectable<br/>
mushrooms can cause diarrhea and vomiting in some people. You can be<br/>
sensitive to one species and fine with others.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful out there!<br/>
