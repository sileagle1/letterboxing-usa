Location:  Lakes Region New Hampshire<br/>
Placed:  8/1/02<br/>
Rated:  easy to moderate<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Find the mount(ain) that ranks higher than a captain and has a great view of <br/>
what the natives call "Winnipiseogee".<br/>
1.  Trail on the left--follow to right<br/>
2.  After crossing your third footbridge start counting your steps.<br/>
3.  152 steps you will see a tree in the center of a roundabout (there is a <br/>
small tree just on the west side of it, and a wedge shaped rock to its <br/>
south).<br/>
4.  Walk 36 steps at 180 degrees up the hill to find a boulder the size of a <br/>
golf cart.<br/>
5.  On the south side of this boulder you will find a small pile of stones, <br/>
beneath which, the fox is hiding.<br/>
**If you have the time and the energy a trip to the top is well worth it.  <br/>
Don't forget to bring water, and remember your route.<br/>

2.  Fox at Water's Edge Letterbox<br/>
Location:  Lakes Region New Hampshire<br/>
Placed:  8/1/02<br/>
Rated:  easy<br/>
Clues:<br/>
There is a park named after Chief Ahanton's daughter--find this park to <br/>
begin your search.  ($3.00 entrance fee)<br/>
1.  Head west from concessions to the beach's end.<br/>
2.  Walk into woods.<br/>
3.  You will be on an old road bed and you will see an old concrete stairway <br/>
leading back down towards the beach.<br/>
4.  Walk down the dirt road until you spot a cement and stone ramp on your <br/>
right.<br/>
5.  At the top of this ramp there is a sizeable stone with a chunk of <br/>
concrete attached.<br/>
6.  At the rear you will see a small pile of stones.  The fox is carefully <br/>
hidden beneath.<br/>
<br/>
These two locations are very popular--particularly in the summer months.  <br/>
Please be discrete when hunting for the fox!<br/>
