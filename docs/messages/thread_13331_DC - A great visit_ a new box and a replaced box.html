                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just returned from a quick trip to DC where I was able to meet up <br/>
with Mary from VA for a late afternoon of letterboxing.  Thankfully <br/>
it seems like I timed my visit to occur during one of the few sunny <br/>
days that you seem to be having lately.  <br/>
<br/>
I was on a mission from Jay to replace the first box in the Drew <br/>
Clan's Kid Gloves series and to plant a microbox of my own as an add-<br/>
on.  Mary and I had made plans to meet at the Woodley Park Metro <br/>
station at 4 pm.  I was supposed to be done with business at 2 pm and <br/>
was sure that I would have lots of time to go back to my hotel and <br/>
change before I met her.  Unfortunately we didn't even finish until <br/>
almost 4.  Thankfully I had worn dress pants and flats to the meeting <br/>
so I had a co-worker drop me off by the station on the way back from <br/>
our meeting.  Also, thankfully, Mary wore jeans and sneakers so she <br/>
was able to get all the boxes that potentially involved getting dirty.<br/>
<br/>
We first got Jay's Kid Gloves, just missed the clues for Squirrel's <br/>
Hal, planted my box and decided to go for A Canadian in DC - haven't <br/>
we been by this spot a few times before?  Reading all the different <br/>
sets of clues and comparing to a map would have saved us from re-<br/>
doing a section over and over.  We were amazed to see that the <br/>
original Kid Gloves boxes were from '99.  Mary has rescued the second <br/>
one for repair and to replace the log. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Mary for a wonderful evening of letterboxing and for going <br/>
out to dinner with me.  I had a great time in DC and will have to <br/>
come back soon to get some of the boxes I missed.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was great fun to spend the afternoon with Trish.  We walked and <br/>
walked, trying to meld together the clues for 5 boxes from 3 people, <br/>
each with a different starting place.  As Trish said, we walked past <br/>
one spot twice before we even knew it would be the location of the <br/>
Canadian in DC box.  <br/>
<br/>
In the Kid Glove series, Box #1 has been replaced but we moved it a <br/>
bit further from the path.  Jay - here is the new paragraph to <br/>
substitute for current paragraph 3:<br/>
<br/>
Turn right, west, on the paved Rock Creek Trail, and just before it <br/>
crosses the creek on a footbridge, turn right onto the singletrack <br/>
Parkway Trail. Walk up and over a small hill and then travel along ten <br/>
feet above the creek in a level stretch with smooth-barked beech trees <br/>
on either side. Before the trail bends slightly to the left, at the <br/>
biggest creek-side beech, just off the trail on the right, is an oak <br/>
tree with a furry vine.  Facing uphill, with your back to the tree, <br/>
find the big tree at the 11 o'clock position.  And that's where you <br/>
will find the Rock Creek Letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
Box #2 was a soggy mess so is out for repairs.  I hope to have it back <br/>
in place by Saturday afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Trish, for including me in the hunt.  Hope you make it back <br/>
here soon!<br/>
<br/>

We had the same thing happen to us when we went to find all these boxes in the same general area, although being a family with a young one (even before there was a tadpole) we didn't do them all in one day.  But I remember that deja vu feeling as we passed Hal and the Magic Mushroom for the second time and Canadian in DC for the THIRD time!<br/>
