I think the law of large numbers says your box goes missing,<br/>
even if 99% of passerbys are "nice folk" and leave it alone, <br/>
if it is in an exposed or heavily trafficked area.<br/>
<br/>
Non-human forces will also move boxes.  I found one about 10m<br/>
from its "intended" hiding place, and its "intended" hiding place<br/>
had a very low chance of accidental discovery yet was easily <br/>
accessable to small mammals and running water after a storm. <br/>
(And there was no doubt about the "indended" hiding place as <br/>
it was a unique distinct feature mentioned directly in the clue.<br/>
I did put it back in its "intended" place, but it brings up an<br/>
interesting question about what to do in less clear circumstances;<br/>
generally I will leave it where I found it, even if I think its<br/>
in the wrong place if there is even a 1% a chance I misinterpreted<br/>
the clue -- another topic for discussion someday :-))<br/>
<br/>
In any case -- lately, I've gotten in the habit of putting them <br/>
under rocks well off-trail in sparsely visited areas, and I try<br/>
to avoid slopes where storm runoff will get them.  I find a round<br/>
rock half buried, pull it out of the ground, place the box in<br/>
the resultant cavity, and find a flatter rock that will fit snugly<br/>
over the hole and look as natural as possible.  I've sometimes<br/>
spent quite a bit of time looking for the right rocks.  I sometimes<br/>
find a good hiding place that meets these criteria, and work<br/>
backwards.  Of course this won't stop some sorts of burrowing mammals,<br/>
oh well.  I hope this works and I hope this helps ...<br/>
<br/>

&gt; As I am currently putting together a replacement box I have come to <br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; standstill as to how to deter losing it again.  As I am a scientist <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; not an English Ph.D. I have come up with a little writers block...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just a simple poll to ask what people are writing in the front cover <br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; the notebook or better yet on the outside of the container to <br/>
&gt; persuade<br/>
&gt; people to respect the contents and location of the letterboxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have always written something on the inside of the log book, <br/>
&gt; however,<br/>
&gt; now that I am thinking about it... Perhaps it would be a better idea <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; write something also on the outside of the box itself.  As a lone<br/>
&gt; tupperware container stained with dirt and rocks may be mistaken as <br/>
&gt; trash,<br/>
&gt; and disposed of without even opening it up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess I will start to include that handy "letterboxing info sheet" <br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; the interior of the box, but I was wondering if anyone has a well <br/>
&gt; written<br/>
&gt; plea or message they include in the log book or on the exterior of <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; box, that may be a little more effective.<br/>
