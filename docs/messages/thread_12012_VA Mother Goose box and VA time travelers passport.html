We're really glad to hear that Crickets!  That is a really fun park for kids &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and a great set of clues for the box.  It's nice to know that the <br/>
&gt; management <br/>
&gt; is supportive!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you know when they start up the passports again?<br/>

Yay!  I look forward to putting more boxes there.  The passport program has <br/>
already started and you can get passports at the Manor House if you're there <br/>
or at any Fairfax County library, I think.  Check the website at <a href="www.timetravelers.org"><br/>
www.timetravelers.org</a>.  We got ours at Greenspring Gardens last weekend and <br/>
had them stamped and look forward to doing the rest.  If you haven't already <br/>
looked at the passport sites, many of them also have letterboxes nearby....  <br/>
Have fun!  Mother of Crickets<br/>
