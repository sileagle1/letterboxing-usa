Look up info on the plant Jewelweed (Impatiens biflora).  It grows <br/>
usually along side poison ivy in those disturbed <br/>
trailside/stonewall/wet bridge areas that poison ivy/oak loves too.  <br/>
Jewelweed is easy to distinguish from other plants... it has a lot of <br/>
moisture in it, and it is a natural antidote to poison ivy oil.  If <br/>
you suspect you've touched poison ivy, and can find jewelweed, crush <br/>
a bit of the plant in your hands and rub it over the places where you <br/>
might have poison ivy oil.  I learned this years ago from a <br/>
Quapaw/Cherokee friend (it's since been 'proved' medically - LOL).  I <br/>
swear by it!<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I dont suppose I should bring up poison sumac, eh?<br/>

Unless I'm badly mistaken, the oils that cause the problems from <br/>
poison oak and poison ivy are *exactly* the same, so anything that <br/>
helps with one should help with the other.<br/>

I'm still looking for that. Poison Oak is found west of the Rockies <br/>
and Poison Ivy is found east of the Rockies. Jewelweed blooms May <br/>
through October in the eastern part of North America from Southern <br/>
Canada to the northern part of Florida.  It is found most often in <br/>
moist woods, usually near poison ivy or stinging nettle. Jewelweed <br/>
often grows on the edge of creek beds. You can purchase jewelweed <br/>
soap and salve.<br/>

Though the many types of ferns do have various medicinal uses, I <br/>
don't think they include combating poison ivy (?).  I've read the <br/>
Polypody fern (the leaves look like little boots) can be used in <br/>
a 'liniment', I dont know what for, and haven't tried it.  <br/>
<br/>
The common field flower, Yarrow, has very fern like leaves (and <br/>
clusters of tiny white flowers), maybe that's what your co-worker <br/>
meant, and that has definate anti-inflamitory properties, a lot of <br/>
people use a poultice from the leaves to releive toothaches, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
you probably didnt want a whole ethnobotany lesson! ;-)<br/>
