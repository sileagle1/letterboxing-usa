Subject: [LbNA] Cameras in Letterboxes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is a disposable camera in one of my Mathman boxes for letterboxers to<br/>
take their picture for me.  I got the idea from the geocache/letterboxes<br/>
around St. Louis/Southern IL that have them.  It also allowed me to verify<br/>
that the students who said they found the box were actually there.  Got some<br/>
interesting pictures from them.  Unfortunately, the letterboxers that came<br/>
didn't use the camera! : (  (Maybe I should've put one in the Buffy box too<br/>
- that one seems more popular.)<br/>
