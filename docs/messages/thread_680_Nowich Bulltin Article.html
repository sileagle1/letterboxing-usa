     The Norwich Bullitn articles was Sunday Sept 17th, in the Active Living<br/>
section..<br/>
     I  learned about Letterboxing in college, accidently,  I was a comparative<br/>
literture student and one of my special areas was late 19th cent. childrens<br/>
literature,  So i was thinking I'd have to go to dartmoor to do this, and then<br/>
it pops up in my own backyard!<br/>
   I had no truoble conning several freinds to going to EMS at the Crystal Mall<br/>
for a letter boxing intro. 0n wens. EMS is taking a bunch of people out Sunday<br/>
for hiking and putting out a letter box! I can't wait! Anyone living in the New<br/>
London, CT area that is interested can sign up. They are bringing compasses so<br/>
if you don't have one that's ok!<br/>

&gt; Awesome! Tom is right: there are just a BUNCH of great hikes that have been<br/>
&gt; letterboxed here in Southern New England. Visiting www.letterboxing.org is<br/>
&gt; the best way to get the clues, but you can also check out the EMS store in<br/>
&gt; the Crystal Mall (no commercial affiliation here....). Those folks have been<br/>
&gt; great about putting the word out and they have a nice binder with about 30<br/>
&gt; letterbox clue sheets all xerox'ed and ready to go for you, as well as great<br/>
&gt; trail guide books, compasses, and maps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are only a few handmade stamps scattered around here: most are<br/>
&gt; commercially made over-the-counter, off-the-rack types, but as Tom says,<br/>
&gt; it's easier than it sounds and really quite addicting to create your own.<br/>
&gt; But don't feel like you HAVE to!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I missed those Norwich Bulletin articles and will have to hit the library to<br/>
&gt; see them. Do you remember the date (more or less), or even the month?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Welcome! Can't wait to see your new boxes up on line!<br/>
