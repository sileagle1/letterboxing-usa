Planted: December 21, 2002 by Music Woman<br/>
Town: Colchester, CT<br/>
Difficulty: Easy, flat railroad bed<br/>
Length: 1/2 mile or so round trip<br/>
<br/>
To Start from Bull Hill Road: (from Points North): Take Route 2 East to exit <br/>
13.  At the end of the ramp, take a right onto Route 66.  At your first <br/>
traffic light, take a left onto South Main Street.  About 1/2 a mile down, <br/>
South Main will veer to the left.  Turn right (kinda more of a straight) onto <br/>
South Road.  Take a right onto Bull Hill Road.  (Once on Bull Hill, look to <br/>
your right, there is an private airport community.  All (or most) of the <br/>
houses have hangers attached.  Cool huh?)  Keep on Bull Hill Road for <br/>
approximately three miles.  Just after the christmas tree farm on your right, <br/>
turn right into the Air Line Trail parking lot.  <br/>
