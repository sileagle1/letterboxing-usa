with a couple of the amazing rangers there, who support letterboxing <br/>
and have signed in to most of the boxes. It's fun to see our carving <br/>
skill progress over the years since our first Monadnock box was <br/>
placed in 1999. These latest two are some of our favorite carvings <br/>
yet.<br/>

Finding the Graphite Mine is an adventure in itself. This historic <br/>
spot is up the Cliff Walk Trail from Emerson's Seat. Turn down into <br/>
the old mine area and notice the rocky ramp that was used to roll <br/>
kegs of graphite down the mountain. From the western end where the <br/>
ramp peters out, take 8 steps east-southeast back along the wall. The <br/>
Graphite Mine Letterbox is planted low, under a big quartz boulder.<br/>

Here's our latest, with stamp art by Ned (11 years old). At the <br/>
junction of the White Cross Trail and the Smith Connecting Link, from <br/>
the "To Bald Rock" paint mark, look 12 steps southwest under a low <br/>
lying shard of schist. As always, please be sure to stay on the rock <br/>
surfaces to protect this fragile alpine environment.<br/>
