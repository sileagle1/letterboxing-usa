                    <div class="plaintext-content">We thought that Memorial Day would be good to look for letterboxes in <br/>
a cemetery, since there would already be visitors and no one would <br/>
notice two more. Well, while we were there, people started pouring in <br/>
to form a parade. Very quickly the small cemetery was full of <br/>
Veterans, Boy Scouts, policemen, sheriff's deputies, and politicians. <br/>
Finally, when two school busses loaded with marching bands pulled in, <br/>
we decided to bolt. <br/>
