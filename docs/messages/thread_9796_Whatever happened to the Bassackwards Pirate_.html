the Pirate carver (humble apologies because I can't remember your <br/>
name) was still deciding whether to stick with the stamp with the <br/>
backwards letters or carve a new one.  For those of you who didn't <br/>
follow the story when it was happening, you'll have to trudge through <br/>
the archives.  Anyway, it's a real cliffhanger and my fingers are <br/>
getting numb holding on waiting for the ending. Let us know - what <br/>
has happened to the Pirate?<br/>
