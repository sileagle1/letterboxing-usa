<div>Hey folks. Just an error correction on the letterboxing hike 
that I have planned for March 11th. I erred when I said "saturday the 11th". The 
11th is actually on a sunday. Yes, sorry for the late correction but it was 
brought up to me by a few people on the list and someone in our store today 
also! So, the hike is still on, however we most likely won't be doing the Little 
Dam series due to the abundance of white stuff on the ground. It's a good hike 
without snow and with or without snow-shoes it will most likley take twice as 
long. So, we will most likely end up doing the Tribal nation series. Maybe we 
will plant a letterbox out there? Not sure on that one. This hike is 
inconjunction with the Connecticut Forest and Park Association so there will 
most likely be a number of folks there! </div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>So, if you have snowshoes, bring-em as it will only benefit 
you! I would definitely recommend a hiking staff or trekking poles for the up 
and down of Lantern Hill. </div>
