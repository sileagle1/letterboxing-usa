<br/>
Please tell the interested ones how your letterboxing went today.  <br/>
Did you get to plant all seven of yours?  Did you find the ones you <br/>
set out for?  Tell me how much fun you had!<br/>
<br/>
I have spent the last 3-4 days reading 100's of posts FAQ's and <br/>
other info anywhere I could find.  I'm still hoping to find more <br/>
LBers in Florida.  Texas sounds like its wide open country also.<br/>
<br/>
As far as whats been going on with other posters, I don't take it <br/>
personal.  I think my ?s were lagit.  I have done lots of reading <br/>
and couldn't find my answers so I asked.  I just suggest other <br/>
newbies read for a couple of days.  I understand about redundunt <br/>
questions. Get quit irritating.<br/>
<br/>
I am now in Orlando.  Maybe my sis will take me to a couple of clues <br/>
I brought with me.  Then off to Ichetucknee to find DRAGONFLY.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a signature stamp yet?<br/>
