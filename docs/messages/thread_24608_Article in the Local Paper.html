little bleary-eyed, when I read "The thrill of the hunt brings <br/>

<br/>
Yep, the Salt Lake Tribune has an article in today's paper about <br/>
letterboxing.  Utah is a relatively small state, population-wise, <br/>
and we've only got about 200 letterboxes, but my family has had a <br/>
blast searching for them.  I tell people about this "treasure hunt," <br/>
and some of them just don't get it!  Hopefully now some others will <br/>
be bitten by the bug!  I'm going to beg, borrow, steal, and buy more <br/>
copies of the paper to show/send to friends and family.  <br/>
<br/>
There's a list of "essentials" which, frankly, I think is a bit over <br/>
the top....colored markers (I have *1* stamp pad), gloves (what <br/>
for?  Unless they're leather to help avoid snake/spider bites?), and <br/>
camoflauge duct tape?  My bag has journals (the kids each have their <br/>
own so they stop fighting over who gets to stamp what where), a <br/>
stamp pad, our stamp (modified store bought), a couple of pens, a <br/>
compass, and baby wipes (for cleaning stamps).  I need to add some <br/>
baggies, and maybe leather gloves.  <br/>
<br/>
Anywho....here's a link to the article.  You can access it for a <br/>
week for free.  After that, it becomes part of their subscription <br/>
service.  <br/>

<br/>
That's a big no-no -- the detergent in the wipes (even the <br/>
"unscented" variety) will transfer to the stamp and attract critters <br/>
who will chew open the letterbox and nibble on the stamp -- and thus <br/>
ruin one more letterbox....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">While this is certainly apt to bring a newboxer into letterboxing the <br/>
article (like many before in other areas) fails to really cover the <br/>
stealth aspect of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I have no doubt that the letterboxers that were interviewed advised <br/>
the writer about the 'sneaky' part of letterboxing, but once <br/>
interviewed those that participate have no editorial control and <br/>
those that read the article may go off half cocked.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully there will be a sufficient number of folks that want to do <br/>
further research prior to going out to find their first letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
We had a writer for the LA Times about 1 year ago contact several <br/>
members of the SoCal chatlist and I wrote the Times writer a note <br/>
advising 'why' I wouldn't participate. My letter stressed the <br/>
failures of other writers to really capture many of the nuances, and <br/>
particularly the stealth aspects of letterboxing. When the article <br/>
finally did get published I was pleasantly surprised that she took my <br/>
challenge and wrote and article that did emphasize secrecy and <br/>
stealth,and promoted doing further reseach prior to going out and <br/>
finding letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
So sometimes not being quoted works to your advantage.<br/>

FYI As far as the list of things to carry... Well, markers come in <br/>
handy if the stamp you find requires multiple colors. SD already <br/>
mentioned that baby wipes are generally a no-no for cleaning stamps. <br/>
Please clean the stamps by using a damp paper towel. Save the wipes <br/>
for inky fingers. :-) Yes to leather/gardening gloves to protect your <br/>
hands from hidden dangers in holes. Many boxers are using the <br/>
camoflage duct tape on their planted boxes to help them blend in <br/>
better.<br/>

everything and never even thought about critters smelling the<br/>

<br/>
I love using multi-colored markers, but for a beginner, those<br/>
can be expensive...I guess that was my point, and I'd never<br/>
thought about leather gloves (seems like a "duh" moment now). <br/>
And the camoflage tape makes sense if you're PLACING a box, but<br/>
for someone just finding a box? <br/>
<br/>
There is a small box with the article talking about being<br/>
discreet when searching, not giving locations away, and rehiding<br/>
the box well, but it wasn't stressed very clearly.  And I wish<br/>
they hadn't included the quotes about geocaching.  We've seen<br/>
what that debate can be like and there's nothing to be gained by<br/>
stirring it up!<br/>
<br/>
All in all, though, I really liked the article.  I think it<br/>
might help my friends and family understand just what I see in<br/>
this hobby.<br/>

&gt; There's a list of "essentials" which, frankly, I think is a bit over <br/>
&gt; the top....colored markers (I have *1* stamp pad), gloves (what <br/>
&gt; for?  Unless they're leather to help avoid snake/spider bites?), and <br/>
&gt; camoflauge duct tape?  My bag has journals (the kids each have their <br/>
&gt; own so they stop fighting over who gets to stamp what where), a <br/>
&gt; stamp pad, our stamp (modified store bought), a couple of pens, a <br/>
&gt; compass, and baby wipes (for cleaning stamps).  I need to add some <br/>
&gt; baggies, and maybe leather gloves.<br/>
<br/>
Lose the baby wipes, for numerous reasons.<br/>

      * IT'S POLITE to contact box placers through one of the<br/>
letterboxing Web sites to let them know if a journal is full, an ink pad<br/>
is dry or the box is missing. Or you can just let them know how much you<br/>
enjoyed their handiwork.<br/>
     * IF YOU TAKE YOUR DOG along, be sure to clean up after it.<br/>
     * RESPECT THE LAND when hunting and hiding. Don't place a box in a<br/>
dangerous or environmentally sensitive area. Warn seekers of possible<br/>
hazards. If you have any doubts about placing a box, ask the landowner<br/>
or manager for permission.<br/>
     * DON'T PUBLISH or retransmit other people's clues or stamp images<br/>
without their permission.<br/>
     * REPACK AND HIDE the thing as well as or better than it was when<br/>
you found it, in the exact place you found it. Try to be discreet when<br/>
stamping up and rehiding it. Don't give away the location to passersby.<br/>
     * DO NOT POST clue solutions on the Internet. That spoils the fun<br/>
for everyone else.<br/>
     * DON'T VIOLATE THE LAWS, rules, customs, and people or property<br/>
rights wherever you conduct any activities.<br/>

<br/>
I read the sidebar but most folks will just cruise right through the <br/>
article and may not read other stuff. The LA Times article I <br/>
mentioned did cover the stealth/secrecy/sneakiness part of <br/>
letterboxing much better. I'm of the opinion that there can never be <br/>
enough coverage on the stealth part of letterboxing, but then again <br/>
that is just my opinion. It is very difficult for anyone just coming <br/>
into letterboxing to figure everything out so there is always a <br/>
reason for redundancy.<br/>
I would like to see a change in the process for folks to access clues <br/>
both at AQ and LbNA. That change would be for them to read and sign <br/>
off on a updated liability waver and read and sign off on a <br/>
guidelines info page. Now I realize that many folks might just record <br/>
their sign off and go about accessing clues, but without a method to <br/>
sign off on those aspects of letterboxing there is no way to put this <br/>
info in front of their noses.<br/>
