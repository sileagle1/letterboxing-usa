                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got back from a wonderful vacation in Montana, and I was able to plant <br/>
two letterboxes while there.  My mother took me, my sister and two of her <br/>
granddaughters to the Flathead Lake area, to show us where she grew up.  <br/>
<br/>
The only disappointment was the devastating fires that are consuming so much <br/>
of the forests there right now.  They tried to get me to believe that there <br/>
are large mountains that loom high in all directions behind the heavy smoke, but <br/>
you couldn't prove it by me.  I hope the firefighters are able to get the <br/>
fires under control soon.  Lets all ask for rain there, eh?<br/>
