&gt; Wow it was pretty damp Sat for See Joy's and my expedition through<br/>
&gt; French Creek SP.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately we came up empty handed. We followed the the story of<br/>
&gt; Kevin &amp; Donna to the letter but became clearly stumped by the extremely<br/>
&gt; vague (nearby rock). If you've ever been there you would know that<br/>
&gt; there are a billion rocks in the area. ={ If anyone would be willing<br/>
&gt; to give the tinniest of clues to Donna's Diary we would be truly<br/>
&gt; grateful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Muk-Luk<br/>
&gt; PS Have a heart, me and my boxing partner have had no luck these last<br/>
&gt; two weekends<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
That's usually how mapsurfer boxes go for me too :)  But, when I finally do get one, I do the Snoopy dance of joy for at least a week :)<br/>
<br/>
Randy, did you ever coem up with a concrete plan for your boxes at Valley Forge? I know you pulled them, but are you going to do the picture thing to verify, or are they gone altogether?<br/>
<br/>
And a general question for CT and RI.  I've noticed a lot of boxes are hidden in Nature Conservancy areas.  Do they allow dogs there?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Kimberly<br/>
