That's a tough one...<br/>
I'd either turn the mystery box into a regular box, especially if I <br/>
really liked the location. Or I would move the mystery box to another <br/>
spot, or really, really obscure the clues.<br/>
Tough choice.<br/>

  leave it <br/>

  the <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think I wasn't quite clear in my post...  I really don't have a <br/>
&gt; problem that the other box is there -- personally it wouldn't bother <br/>
&gt; me if they were only a few feet from each other.  The problem is that <br/>
&gt; because of its proximity, since that box is not a mystery box, it <br/>
&gt; gives away the park and the starting location (trail) within the park <br/>
&gt; for my mystery box (due to mention of a landmarks that most would not <br/>
&gt; know without being there).  To move the box elsewhere in the park <br/>
&gt; would not change that.  I played around with changing my clues to not <br/>
&gt; reference the specific places that are mentioned in the other clues, <br/>
&gt; but taking that information out would leave a person wondering around <br/>

ITA. I set up this same scenario with some mystery boxes of mine here<br/>
in VA and imagined what would I do if the same thing happened to me --<br/>
someone went to the park where my boxes are and decided to plant some<br/>
boxes there but didn't know about the mystery boxes already there,<br/>
then another boxer is browsing the VA mystery boxes after having done<br/>
the nonmystery boxes at this park and they crack the code I wrote my<br/>
mystery box clues in and they realize that these mystery boxes are at<br/>
the same park clearly named in the other boxers' nonmystery box clues.<br/>
And then I thought, Who cares? So what? Research is research, even if<br/>
it's accidental.<br/>
<br/>
I would just leave things as they are. Either someone is going to<br/>
figure it out because they've already gotten the nonmystery box or<br/>
they'll tackle the mystery box first and realize eventually there's a<br/>
mystery and a nonmystery box at this location.<br/>

else's boxes... who cares??  You might not ever have visitors to your <br/>
box if it is isolated and that area is never given exposure!  I know <br/>
that in CT, there's actually several mystery boxes that depend on <br/>
finding one to get the next. Its actually kind of fun! Of course I'm <br/>
still banging my head against the wall about it... but its fun!<br/>
<br/>
As long as you can eliminate the "chance" that someone will not <br/>
accidently find your mystery if they happen to be a touch off on the <br/>
other box's clues...then it is still a mystery; I'd probably not <br/>
alter the mystery clues. <br/>
