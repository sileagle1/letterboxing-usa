<br/>
I wasn't sure if I let you all know that I dried out and replanted the NWITW box.  It only was out of commission for a coupla of days.  However, the book had gotten wet so some images were damaged.  I left the log even though it's a bit warped because it's part of its history.  If you happen by the box and have stamped it before, please feel free to stamp again.  I am going to check on it more regularly and maybe use smaller log books, or tear out pages and paste them into a log at home.  I'd love to have all of your images.  Besides, the has been beautiful lately!!!  I have never seen the water that high!  The water was roaring over the falls and down under the road.  I was there at night on my last 2 trips to rescue and replant, and the water sounded wonderful.  Please enjoy this spot while you may.<br/>

  Naked Woman in the Waterfall was left open, top of the box off, and caught last week's rain storm, apparently, and all the contents were floating in a containerful of water. :-(  Lots of the stamp images are ruined but not entirely lost (what was that smudge?) and the ink messages are still legible.  I took her home to dry her off and dry out the pages of the log.  Hopefully I can return everything tomorrow sometime.  Thank you all for the visits!  This is her second log book since Betz and I first placed her.  The waterfall was running fast and furious tonight!  I bet this spot was just gorgeous lately in the warm autumn sun.  I'm figuring some non-boxer happened upon this box by accident and just left the box open.  Maybe there is a geocache close by because the box gets lots of trinket-type stuff in it.  Unfortunately, just about all of those things were ruined from sitting in the box of water.<br/>
