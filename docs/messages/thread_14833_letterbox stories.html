am tired of reading it -- BUT -- my two cents -- I really enjoy reading <br/>
people's letterbox stories!! (maybe that's because I have to justify <br/>
subjecting you all to ours....)<br/>
<br/>
I think it is really helpful to put the state abbreviation first to ensure <br/>
that it definitely shows up.  Sometimes if the title is too long it gets cut <br/>
off.  That way, when I am behind on my letterbox reading, I can quickly scan <br/>
for those in the DC area.  When I have more time (maybe when the kids are <br/>
back in school!....) I can expand the reading to include the anecdotes from <br/>
around the country.<br/>
<br/>
It is a little frustrating when there is no state abbreviation at all.  <br/>
After all, I can only sit at the computer and ignore my family for so long <br/>
so I have to make the most of my chat time!...  BeMa<br/>
