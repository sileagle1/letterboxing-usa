<div>dvn2r ckr commented that rnrB and trkr had gotten all the 
boxes in a 200 mile radius, so I rushed out to place some more for them.  
Then she said they were still in Northern California; they are still there for 
when they get back.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Friend's Landing is a great place.  The interpretive 
trail is totally wheelchair accessible.  The boxes are not, due to the 
requirement that they not be visible to just anyone.  As can be seen in the 
pictures, the trail and the river fishing is accessible to all.</div>

picture with the sun shining through the tree.  It brought us the <br/>
page describing the Swainsons thrush.  I have always wondered <br/>
what that bird was called and EVEN was discussing it today!  <br/>
Isn't that something?  I have always referred to it as the <br/>
WhirlyBird, my best description as to how it sounds.   I know, sort <br/>
of lame but when you don't know....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I appreciate knowing what that bird is called now.<br/>
