&gt;Hey B-Fly, thats not a bad idea,We have a couple of spare bedrooms.We could turn are house into a CT.letterboxers bed &amp; brakefast.I could shake Kathy out of bed at 3:30 a.m to cook everyone a hardy breakfast, and I was going to buy a new truck, but i,ll buy a passenger van instead and give them a tour around the northeast corner and get them lots and lots of letterboxes.But theres only one think stopping me (KATHY) lol.<br/>
