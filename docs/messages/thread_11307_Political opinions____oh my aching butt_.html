Dear dvn2r<br/>
<br/>
Your political opinion is in my opinion not a topic for this LBNA <br/>
list. <br/>
I think with this step the United States lost all over the world <br/>
their face and<br/>
left the Nations of the World. In all european countries are the <br/>
people this<br/>
time on the street and demonstrate against the United States, the US <br/>
President<br/>
and the attack to a indipendent country.<br/>
<br/>
Nice greetings from OLD EUROPE<br/>

    That was a very nice prayer for our troops. One that should be <br/>
said daily. Although I have no one close overseas I do care for all <br/>
families involved. <br/>
    Thank you dvn2r for putting it on the list. Even though it is off <br/>
topic, it is on everyone's mind.<br/>
    God bless all,<br/>
