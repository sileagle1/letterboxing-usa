helpful to list the State in the headline because sometimes I just delete <br/>
the States that aren't mine however, I am a fan of some posters from around <br/>
the country and look forward to reading some of their comments even if they <br/>
aren't from my particular state. I'd mention you by name but I would hate to <br/>
put pressure on you to continue to post witty and clever items on the board.<br/>
Besides if we broke up the board how would be keep up with the other States <br/>
and their gatherings?<br/>

Just my two cents.<br/>
