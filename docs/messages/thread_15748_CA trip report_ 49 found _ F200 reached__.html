                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm just getting back from my whirlwind tour of California, and the story <br/>
told by the numbers is pretty remarkable: I found 49, logged 21 exchanges <br/>
(at the N. Cal. gathering and elsewhere), and logged 6 event stamps.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to hook up with Princess Lea &amp; Amanda from Seattle for some late <br/>
afternoon boxing in SF on Friday (F7), and then explored the East Bay area <br/>
before the gathering (F6). I added another F10 at the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
I had a great time at the gathering, though I was late due to traffic <br/>
(well, and to that urge to "find just one more letterbox" <g>). It was nice <br/>
to meet Sir B &amp; Jugglermouse, Todd &amp; Pam, Doublesaj &amp; Old Blue, A-Bear, <br/>
Miss Vicky, Javalord &amp; Esmecat (thanks for the terrific coffee!) and all <br/>
the rest who I've forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
On Monday, I logged both boxes in Folsom (F2), before heading down to the <br/>
Kernville area to grab a bunch of boxes in two days of hardcore <br/>
letterboxing (F22). Don &amp; Gwen were remarkable hosts, and with Don as my <br/>
guide, I got to find some boxes that I'd otherwise not have been able to <br/>
reach on my own. (Plus, I found one of their letterboxes in one the most <br/>
beautiful places I've ever visited.) With the wealth of letterboxes in the <br/>
area, it's surprising that there haven't been more letterboxers who've <br/>
visited -- I was the first finder on a number of boxes, and only the second <br/>
or third to find some of the others that had been planted a year or two <br/>
ago. Of the multitude of boxes there, you'll find drive-by letterboxes as <br/>
well as multi-mile hikes, boxes only accessible by 4-wheel drive, and boxes <br/>
that can be reached by mountain-bike or kayak if you choose! Plus, the <br/>
scenery can't be beat! I highly recommend a visit.<br/>
<br/>
Then, I snagged the Red Rock Canyon and Vasquez Rocks boxes on my way into <br/>
LA (F2).<br/>
<br/>
And... I breezed by F200 at the end of the trip!<br/>
