clue difficulty: easy <br/>
terrain: well marked path, muddy in places <br/>
distance: .45 miles from trailhead <br/>
<br/>
  The letterbox is located at Southwick Pond which straddles the <br/>
Paxton/Leicesster town line. From Worcester take Pleasant Street <br/>
(Rte. 122) west to Wallbridge Road in Paxton. Turn left onto <br/>
Walbridge and drive to the end of the road where you will find a <br/>
small parking area.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Southwick Pond is part of the Greater Worcester Land Trust Tetasset <br/>
Hills Trail system. The parcel is 112 acres of beautiful woodlands <br/>
with a loop trail that is approximately 1 - 1 1/2 miles long. The <br/>
trail leads to two farming ponds connected by a dike. The area is <br/>
home to migrating swallows, whitetail deer, beaver, turtles, <br/>
woodpeckers and lots of bright orange newts. Watch your step! We have <br/>
seen lots of newts on the trail. At the end of June the Mountain <br/>
Laurel is in bloom and you find yourself in an enchanted forest <br/>
surrounded by white blossoms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enter the trail at the sign. Follow the trail blazed with white <br/>
markers and blue triangles southward until you come to a log and <br/>
plank boardwalk over a small stream. Continue along the trail for <br/>
another 1/10 of a mile noticing the rock walls to your left. When you <br/>
come to the corner intersection of two rock walls there will be a <br/>
break in the wall 30 paces ahead and another trail heading east. Head <br/>
through the break in the wall and follow this trail east. There will <br/>
be a rock wall on your left. As you walk watch for breaks in the rock <br/>
wall. At the second break leave the path and walk 12 steps on the <br/>
unmarked path to the break. Do not pass through the break. Turn to <br/>
your right (east) and walk 12 steps along the wall. You should end up <br/>
behind a large Mountain Laurel. The box you seek is under some flat <br/>
stones next to the wall. Look for three small stones on top of a <br/>
larger flat one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After you find the box if you continue along the blue blazed trail <br/>
you will reach Southwick Pond. The trail is a loop that will bring <br/>
you back to the corner intersection of the two rock walls. A trail <br/>
map can be found at <br/>

Enjoy your visit to this beautiful area.<br/>
