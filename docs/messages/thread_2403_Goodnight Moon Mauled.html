scattered about in the woods. It's box damaged the notebook soaked <br/>
beyond drying out and use, the ink missing but the stamp was <br/>
retrieved!  So I have the bits and pieces home for a rebuild. I made <br/>
a new notebook and have transferred some of the dates and guests who <br/>
signed in.  I will get a new box and ink soon should have it back out <br/>
there within the week with ammended clues the town  has a big <br/>
construction project in that park and moved a few clue stones . ( <br/>
half the size of my car too )  Anyway just wait and the new moon will <br/>
come into it's phase.    Leader of the Pack. <br/>
