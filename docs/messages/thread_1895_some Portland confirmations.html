                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those who may be interested, I went out today to confirm the status of a <br/>
few of my older boxes in the Portland, Oregon area... some of which had been <br/>
reported missing.<br/>
<br/>
I am delighted to report that the Mount Tabor box in SE Portland is safe and <br/>
sound. It has now been visited five times.  Keep looking, Amanda... maybe <br/>
you'll be Number Six.  As they say... third time's a charm!!!<br/>
<br/>
Amanda had also reported that my Wahkeena Falls box in The Gorge had likely <br/>
washed away, and I can now positively confirm that this is correct.<br/>
<br/>
Numerous reports that the nearby Ponytail Falls box was missing also proved <br/>
to be true.  I found Cole's note in the hiding place, and tend to agree with <br/>
him that the box was most likely stolen.  I will try to replace both of these <br/>
Waterfall boxes before spring.  Meanwhile, I will add a note to the clue <br/>
pages to indicate they are missing.<br/>
<br/>
While in The Gorge, I had time to check out a couple of my other boxes.  The <br/>
elusive Multnomah Falls box is still there.  It has withstood numerous floods <br/>
and some major buldozer action, and has remained exacly where I placed it in <br/>
1998.  At first glance, this box might appear to be a quick-and-easy roadside <br/>
"gimmee", but only three  people have visited this box in nearly three years, <br/>
even though five or six million people have likely walked within a few yards <br/>
of it during that time period.  Goes to show, you can't always judge a book <br/>
by it's cover!!!<br/>
<br/>
The highlight of my day was a quick visit to my Horsetail Falls box.  No less <br/>
than EIGHTEEN people (including one party from NJ) have stamped into this <br/>
box, and it is still in great condition!!!  My congratulations and thanks go <br/>
out to all of them. I think it's safe to say that letterboxing is alive and <br/>
well in Portland, Oregon...<br/>
<br/>
Enthusiastically,<br/>
Mitch (Der Mad Stamper)<br/>
