&gt; Just heard from Wanda last night that she found her 5000th box on top<br/>

&gt; two little gems, Beryl and Garnet along the way, bringing us up to a <br/>
&gt; total of 100 boxes planted.<br/>

So, in other words, Wanda has handled more than 50% of all the<br/>
letterboxes in existence!  I'm not sure which statistic is more<br/>
impressive, the 5K or the 10K! <br/>

Give 2 or 3 experienced boxers about 5 minutes to look at their logs <br/>
and I'd  bet the list of local south eastern Connecticut unpublished <br/>
boxes likely flirts with 100. Thats just ones that we know of!  Add <br/>

Hoever, even if  its 48% or 50% though, Wanda's accomplishments are <br/>
indeed noteworthy and significant; for that we definately give her a <br/>
pat on the back!  [ and maybe some new hiking boots! ] <br/>

I've only listed 2 or 3 on the site myself, and now that I've finally placed over 100 - <br/>
you can certainly add that to the extra unpublished as well. Why does "L" get all the <br/>
credit?! ;-)  I'd say Jay's P and F-ness is quite balanced in my opinion. Nice Job! <br/>
