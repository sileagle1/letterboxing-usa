I work for Southern California Edison, the largest Southern<br/>
California electric company. To help coordinate emergency response<br/>
in the fire-burned areas around Lake Arrowhead, the company has sent<br/>
up our Mobile Command Center to Santa's Village, located near Lake<br/>
Arrowhead, along Highway 18. I received a page yesterday saying a<br/>
piece of equipment had gone down in the command center, and they<br/>
needed an immediate replacement. Long story short, I was given a<br/>
Sheriff's Department pass to travel into the restricted fire area in<br/>
order to facilitate the installation of said device. I've just<br/>
returned home from my trip. Let me report that up there on the<br/>
mountain is death, war, horror, and destruction. I saw enormous<br/>
areas blackened and denuded of trees and chaparrel--and a number of<br/>
burned houses and vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
As far as letterboxes are concerned, I didn't have time to check on<br/>
the status of "Tunnel II Trail" and "Rock Camp," because of my work<br/>
(I never found these LBs previous to the fires). I was also not able<br/>
to check on the status of "Crest Park Picnic Area," or "Rim of the<br/>
World Drive" (I do have the "Rim..." stamp from a previous visit,<br/>
which was planted by a Chow-Labrador dog), because that stretch of<br/>
the highway was closed because of a large rock slide, and they made<br/>
me detour around it. I did get to visit, for the first time,<br/>
the "Mormon Lumber Road" letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Annette from Gnosis 4H, I found the "Mormon Lumber Road" letterbox in <br/>
a burned out area. The container is melted and burnt, and the plastic <br/>
bags containing the stamp and stampbook are all fused together from <br/>
the heat, but the stamp and stampbook are fine. The stampbook is<br/>
slightly singed, but is basically perfect--it smells strongly of the<br/>
fire. The last entry was entered on 10/18/03, just one week before<br/>
the conflagration. I took pictures showing what the letterbox area<br/>
looks like as I found it, and will show the photos to you, and/or<br/>
post them, if they turn out okay after being developed (cheap camera<br/>
used). I have the "Mormon Lumber Road" letterbox with me now, and we <br/>
can talk offline about the best way to get it back to you. In my <br/>
opinion, this would make a great Event Stamp--a box that survived the <br/>
2003 Southern California Wildfires--it should be passed around to <br/>
events around the country, like other Event Stamps that came to the <br/>
recent SLO Stamping in the Meadow Event.<br/>
