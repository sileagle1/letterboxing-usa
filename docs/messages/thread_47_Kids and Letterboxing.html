<br/>
Just a few thoughts that I wanted to throw into the discussion of Kids and<br/>
Maps.<br/>
<br/>
It occurs to me that the number of five year olds who have the freedom to hop<br/>
in the car and drive themselves to some remote area where a letterbox is<br/>
hidden is quite small.  Realistically, any excursion of any magnitude will<br/>
have to be planned by an adult.  For this reason, I think kid-friendly<br/>
letterboxes can be put on the same maps with the others, although a seperate<br/>
page listing only those that are appropriate for kids would be a nice addition<br/>
to Kids Corner.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest opportunity I see to get kids interested in our hobby is to<br/>
encourage them to make their own letterbox, hide it in the neighborhood, and<br/>
tell other kids how to find it.  Such "local" letterboxes will probably not be<br/>
suitable for adding to our maps, but will be fun for kids to make and play<br/>
with.  This is where I think the bulk of effort needs to go.  Then, once a<br/>
youngster's interest has been sparked, they can start bugging the folks to<br/>
check out the maps (or the list) and try to find some nearby kid-friendly<br/>
clues to "real" letterboxes.  As a family, then, they can plan a trip and all<br/>
go out and search together.<br/>

&gt; Older<br/>
&gt;  kids know what state they are in and can probably go through the regular <br/>
&gt; maps,<br/>
&gt;  but younger kids will need mom or dad I assume to help them.  Has anyone <br/>
&gt; else<br/>
&gt;  thought this through...<br/>
&gt;  about how to set up the links for kids?  Should there be a Kid's looking <br/>
&gt; state<br/>
&gt;  map of texas with the Pooh type of format.  Or should there be a "Kids Map"<br/>
&gt; link<br/>
&gt;  option at the regular clues page?  Or some other way?<br/>

I don't know if you've checked Coon's Cache lately, but there are at<br/>
least 2 entries by letterboxers under the age of 12.  My son (who is 5)<br/>
dragged his visiting grandparents out to find it after our original<br/>
entry.  I agree with what you said, because of the proximity to our<br/>
neighborhood, coon's cache and the now removed Rock Creek, are both<br/>
great for kids. Some further exploration beyond Coon's cache has given<br/>
me at least one more hiding spot and I'm sure there are another half<br/>
dozen without really trying.<br/>
<br/>
The next step for the little ones I have been "mentoring" is the stamp<br/>
carving.  I had Brian draw a picture on a piece of eraser and I carved<br/>
it for him.  I think we will do that a few more times.  He still refers<br/>
to it as his stamp.  I think he will soon have his own box to place...<br/>
and then he'll be hooked like the rest of us!<br/>
