Difficulty: Easy. Placed 7-06-03 by Salamander. This letterbox is <br/>
located in Scioto Trails State Park. Driving directions: Rt. 23 south <br/>
of Chillicothe or north of Waverly, Ohio; turn east onto Rt.372 <br/>
(which is the park entrance).CLUES: Follow the main entrance road to <br/>
a point just past the fire tower. You will then take park road #1 to <br/>
park road #4. Follow road #4 .1 mile to a parking area on the right. <br/>
Stop here. You should see a lone picnic table to the right of the <br/>
parking spaces. Stand at the corner of the table which is nearest the <br/>
oak tree and take a reading of 277 degrees. Go 11 paces at that <br/>
heading to fairly large tree. The box is hidden at the base of the <br/>
tree, under a log and some sticks.<br/>
