                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings.  I recently joined the list and after a few<br/>
days of going through the archives I realized there<br/>
just weren't enough hours in my life for me to get<br/>
through them all :)  So I hope I don't ever have the<br/>
"stupid question police" coming after me--they sound<br/>
vicious!  Wanted to take a moment to say hi.  I'm from<br/>
northeast Ohio.  My boyfriend &amp; I first learned of<br/>
letterboxing last fall by accident, trying to find<br/>
information online about Squire's Castle here in Ohio.<br/>
 We were taken to a link about a letterbox hidden<br/>
somewhere around there and decided we had a new hobby.<br/>
 After our Ohio winter hibernation, we recently found<br/>
our first box a few weeks ago.  Yea :)<br/>
<br/>
(By the way, we never found the "Squire's Castle" box<br/>
and think it might be missing; we tried to contact the<br/>
placer through the letterboxing.org clue page but<br/>
never heard back.  Don't know if they're on the list<br/>
or not...)<br/>
<br/>
So nice to see we're in good company.  Call us<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome Doodle, to this wonderful contagious hobby! My father was born and raised in Tiffin Ohio and I was in <br/>
Cleveland for awhile while I work3ed for Harris Broadcast Division.  Lovely place.  We look forward to seeing and <br/>
hearing more from you on the list here and don't worry what anyone says, the only stupid question is the one you don't <br/>
ask.  I for one delight in answering a persons questions, even if someone else already asked them. Questions are how <br/>
we learn.  Some people though, don't, so take the rude comments they may make with a grain of salt and, for the most <br/>
part, ignore them.<br/>
<br/>
Again, well met, and perhaps one day, we'll meet on the trail for an eXchange!<br/>
