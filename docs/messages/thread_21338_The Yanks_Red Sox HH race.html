First of all, I think this is a great idea.  This must have been a <br/>
huge undertaking for the May Day Lillies.  Let's see...they needed <br/>
to carve one Yankees' stamp and I'm guessing that they must have <br/>
carved like 100 Red Sox stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
As we all know, the Red Sox only make it to the "big show" once <br/>
every century or so.  Here's the math:  Red Sox- 16200 games: 1 <br/>
World Series.  Yankees:  16200 games:  what is it like 26 times <br/>
now.  Anyone good at figuring out averages.  Well I am,  that works <br/>
out to 1 world series WIN every 623 games.  And the Red Sox work out <br/>
to....oh yeah ...one win every 16200 games.  Now I ask you, if you <br/>
were to take the emblems off the jerseys,  which team would you say <br/>
stinks?  Remember the stats: <br/>
<br/>
Red Sox 1:16200    Yankees 623:16200.  <br/>
<br/>
See what I mean, they're not even good on paper.   At least the Red <br/>
Sox were smart enough to dump Lowe and Martinez.  When they were <br/>
pitching, it looked like they were throwing batting practice.   I <br/>
mean the Cardinals played like the "Bad News Bears" in the world <br/>
series.   I would hope that the Red Sox, being a "professional" <br/>
organization, would be able to beat the "Bad News Bears."  And they <br/>
did....how special.  <br/>
<br/>
In closing, the Yanks, on average, should win <br/>
this race too.  Or is it going to be the curse of the ink pad? <br/>
Right, Mark?<br/>

Spoken like a typical Spankee fan..<br/>
Can you say biggest CHOKE in sports HISTORY!!?!?!?<br/>
I LOVED the look on all the spankee fans as they lost(blew) game 7<br/>
(not to mention 4,5&amp;6). I'd have traded 10 world series wins for <br/>
that. You can have all those titles, and your "all-star teams", we <br/>
demoralized you. HA!<br/>
