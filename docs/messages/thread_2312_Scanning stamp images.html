&lt;&lt; If there is any one else who would prefer I not post a scan of the stamp<br/>
from one of their letterboxes please let me know and I will not. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really hate to rain on anyone's parade, especially since Keith has created <br/>
such a nice Webpage, but I feel it deserves to be pointed out that this is <br/>
probably not the best way to handle such matters.  In fact, it is most likely <br/>
a blatent copyright violation.<br/>
<br/>
It is my understanding that any hand-carved rubber stamp image technically <br/>
belongs to the maker of the stamp. Finding a letterbox does not give one the <br/>
right to publish the stamp's image without first obtaining the express <br/>
permission of the original artist.<br/>
<br/>
It is up to the artist to decide whether or not to publish a stamp image... <br/>
and if they decide to allow it to be published, they should have exclusive <br/>
control over WHERE it is published.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt that posting a general notice asking people to speak up if they <br/>
object to their image being used is really sufficient.  As an analogy, what <br/>
if I were to publish a notice in the LA Times asking authors to let me know <br/>
if they object to having me plagiarize their works?  I don't think I would <br/>
legally be able to get away with reprinting a Stephen King novel just because <br/>
he failed to respond to my notice.  Whether it's a book, an oil painting, or <br/>
a rubber stamp image, one must legally obtain specific permission from its <br/>
creator before re-publishing it in printed form or on a Webpage.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not trying to single Keith out for a scolding... I just want to help <br/>
avoid future problems.  For the record, I would prefer that none of my stamp <br/>
images be published anywhere besides my own Webspace. <br/>

<br/>
I disagree, technically placed in the public they in the public domain.<br/>
That being said I believe that doing what is right is more important than<br/>
what is "legal".  I will not post the scans and will remove the ones I have<br/>
posted, except for the scan of the LbNA patch since that seems to be the<br/>
general desire.  I apologize if I ruffled any one's feathers.<br/>
