trail. Probably should have started a little earlier too! Did well <br/>
for the first half but where the blue trail runs by the road is <br/>
TOTALLY flooded for a looooong stretch. Back tracked a bit and came <br/>
upon a guy running the trail with his dog and he showed us the way <br/>
to hop on the road and then jump back in the woods and on the trail <br/>
again.  It got a weeeeee bit dark and we needed the flashlight at <br/>
the second box and all the way down the steep hill and back to the <br/>
big oak.  Got the 3rd one with no problem and then got the heck out <br/>
of the woods! Finally out of there at 8:50 and it was VERY dark by <br/>
then. Good thing I thought to bring that darned flashlight!!!<br/>
<br/>
All boxes in good condition, dry, logs have room. Last activity was <br/>
early may in #1 and #2. June 2nd for #3 box. <br/>
