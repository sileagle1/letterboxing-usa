<div>I have enjoyed experimenting with different mediums, tools, and methods.  All in all, I'd say Tom's evolutionary quip probably works for all of us.  I'd like to think that the general trend is toward improvement with experience.  As to carving with power tools, tried that, and found the results to be satisfactory.  I would agree that a firm medium should be used; the gummy types won't work.  I used very small electronic/jewelry type drill bits in a rotary tool, and was able to accomplish fairly fine detail.  A steady hand is a must,and a magnifying lamp helps.  I did have a problem with the fine cuttings clogging the work.  Attached is a scan of a stamp made using this method (this is legedemaine #16).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The best tools I've found are ones that I've made using medical contraband.  Scapel blades come in assorted shapes and sizes, and are much finer, thinner, and sharper than X-acto blades. But the best of all are hypodermic needles, which also come in a variety of sizes.  These are very sharp and fine, and you can do very detailed work with them.  In fact, the degree of detail is more limited by the medium than the tool.  To make any of these, simply use a two part epoxy to mount them in a wooden handle.  A dowel or shaft of bamboo of approxiamtely 1/4" diameter and 4-6" long is about right.  The hard part, of course, is finding a way to get your hands on some without having to go through medical school...  </div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Again thanks.  A very neat carving.  I am a long time carver, but never have<br/>
tried anything on such a small scale.  I'm thinking of trying some acrylic.<br/>
At least it sounds like a hard surface.<br/>
