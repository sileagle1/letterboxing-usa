Try again--both boxes were intact last month!<br/>

                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>The Petticoat Hill boxes are the first two we ever went out for and found. Neither of them were easy, and not very many people had stamped into them before us (I think we were fifth and third on these two, if i recall correctly). So, the boxes are there.....just have to find the right flat rock out of all the ones that are there. Buckaroo hides her boxes well! Â :-)
