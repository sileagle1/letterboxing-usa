<br/>
Had the wonderful pleasure of hooking up with fellow<br/>
carvers/letterboxers Jane and Jacques Arnal this week in the Portland<br/>
area and we hit the Columbia River Gorge.  <br/>
<br/>
We found both of these boxes in tact.  However, some of the important<br/>
landmarks in the clues are now missing, so it was incredible to have<br/>
found them at all!<br/>
<br/>
Clues for the Lemur Letterbox, which I placed only a couple weeks ago<br/>
are drastically different.  There is no longer a log to step over and<br/>
the immovable rock that was left center of the path was obviously<br/>
movable by the forest service and volunteers who did a terrific job of<br/>
trail maintenance recently because it is gone!  The box is still<br/>
findable, but clues are unfortunately tougher.  I guess you'll just have<br/>
to look for the good-size flat mossy rock on the left a ways down the<br/>
path from the arched tree.  The really obvious landmarks are now<br/>
history.  I will probably go back and try to figure out some better<br/>
clues when I get a chance in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Horsetail Falls is still there, but there is no longer a stone giant's<br/>
finger that crosses your path, or anything that remotely resembles it.<br/>
These clues were once very fun and simple to figure out and I've been<br/>
out there twice before, but this time I had difficulty without that very<br/>
important landmark.  Not only that, but the porous rock wasn't there.<br/>
It was hidden by a regular old rock.  Luckily Jacques eyeballed just a<br/>
tad of plastic peering out and he managed to nab the box!  The logbook<br/>
is soggy and the stamped images are bleeding, mushy and faded, but<br/>
otherwise things are intact.  I put a porous rock on top of the regular<br/>
rock that is hiding the box, so maybe that will help others in their<br/>
discoveries.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
