of Putney Mountain in Putney, VT.<br/>
<br/>
360 degree views of 3 states - VT, NY &amp; NH. This area is known for the<br/>
migratory birds that pass through. There is even a large instruction board<br/>
that shows the silhouettes of different birds in order to aid in identifying<br/>
them. The box is gone but it's home to other boxes planted by MommaFox &amp;<br/>
Bald Eagle and The Schmoopies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While we've had all the boxes there for some time, we return quite often to<br/>
gaze at the view - and to stop for dinner at the Putney Diner - great food<br/>
and the desserts, all made there, are to die for!<br/>

p.s. though I haven't seen bear and eagles while letterboxing, my first letterboxing trip included a hike to look for butterflies--which we found--and a butterfly stamp! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been blessed to see some truly amazing sites during some of my letterboxing adventures, but a few came immediately to mind when I saw this thread:<br/>
<br/>
Three Forks, Montana, where I stood on the same ledge that Meriwether Lweis stood while surveying the Missouri River Headwaters.<br/>
<br/>
Independence Rock, WY. I arrived there very early in the morning and when I finally figured out where to go, I met a University Professor who was cataloging pioneer wagontrain grafitti on the rock.<br/>
<br/>
Troy, NJ. Finding a box at sunrise with the clouds and sun mirrored in the water.<br/>
<br/>
But there are so many other places involving beautiful land, lighthouses, historical sites. <br/>
<br/>
This is SUCH a great hobby!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our most memorable box was on Campobello Island.  We had a gorgeous 2 hour<br/>
hike in (and I fell and twisted my foot about a third of the way) with<br/>
beautiful overlooks of Maine's Bold Coast.  It took us two hours because we<br/>
stopped at every scenic overlook on the way to the box, but only took us 45<br/>
minutes to hike out.  It took us an hour to actually find the box when we go<br/>
to the location, because the box was over 7 years old and the trails had<br/>
changed but the clue hadn't.  Finally ATVracer said, I'm doing this my way<br/>
and walked straight to it.  It hadn't been found in over three years and the<br/>
clues aren't listed anymore that I know of, since it was on geocities.  <br/>
