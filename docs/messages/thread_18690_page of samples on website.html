Seeing others' carving will help, especially if some of them aren't very good, as well as the really good ones.  One takes heart seeing that those who are now master crafters were once pretty mediocre.  It highlights that one learns and improves, and the new carvers may be heartened.

see image examples. <br/>
<br/>
If you go to our Yahoogroup and check the files area, you will find <br/>
a folder with images of the stamps we've carved.  (Note: yes, you <br/>
will have to join the group to view the files, but you won't get a <br/>
mailbox full of unwanted messages. Only the moderator posts ... and <br/>
not even once a month.) Here's the link: <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Letterboxing_Bindlestiff/<br/>
<br/>
As SpringChick pointed out, there are plenty of places on the web <br/>
where images of carved stamps can be viewed, but it does take some <br/>
time and effort to find 'em. Kinda like letterboxing, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
It's important to keep in mind that there are plenty of boxers who <br/>
prefer not to view the image of a stamp until they actually find it.<br/>
<br/>
As for your comments of: "you don't want to go letterboxing without <br/>
your signature stamp finished, and yet you hate to make your <br/>
signature stamp before seeing a couple" ... well ... <br/>
<br/>
The very night I stumbled upon letterboxing while link surfing the <br/>
net, I carved my very first stamp by taking a kitchen knife and <br/>
hacking up an old eraser that we already had. I had never seen <br/>
another signature stamp but the very next morning I went to <br/>
Michael's (craft store) bought a carving set and speedy stamp and <br/>
carved our signature stamp. Silly me, I thought I had to have a <br/>
single signature stamp for my husband and myself, so I spent way too <br/>
much time trying to come up with one that would have initials we <br/>
could both use. LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
Your anxiety is probably more normal that what I did though. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

from our web page. It's in the links section and if you spend 30 <br/>
seconds poking around, you'll find our signature stamp and a few that <br/>
we've placed. As time permits, we'll even upload a few more. Only <br/>
request is that you just note that we carved them...and we don't post <br/>
our images of mysteries that we've placed -- they hold a special <br/>
place in our heart, i mean logbook!<br/>
<br/>
Also, check the other links if you want to browse carvings. I know <br/>
the DrewClan website in particular has a ton of images. Several other <br/>
pages have images too. It may infact even be more subtle to check <br/>
links rather than have an image gallery or database....ya never know.<br/>
