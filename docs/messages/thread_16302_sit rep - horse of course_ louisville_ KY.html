                    <div class="plaintext-content">this box was a challenge! not only is the park VERY WELL USED! the <br/>
trails were very confusing!!! but, a lot of my confusion lies on my <br/>
part since i ALWAYS try to outguess the placer....a VERY WRONG thing <br/>
to do! but if i DO outguess the placer, i get a stronger feeling of <br/>
accomplishment.....so i'm strange, i know that ! :-)<br/>
<br/>
anyway, my first attempt was a total wash because there were sooooo <br/>
many people at the park and, well to put it politely, mother nature <br/>
began calling me half-way through the hike! so i felt a bit rushed <br/>
and thought that i found the general area of the stamp after about 2 <br/>
hours of hiking around (but really enjoying the park along the way) <br/>
and called it quits.<br/>
<br/>
i returned two days later, in the morning, conducted a pre-hike pit-<br/>
stop, and followed the clues this time.  there were a few areas that <br/>
were a little confusing, but since i was pretty sure that i had <br/>
found the general area of the stamp the first time around, i just <br/>
kept heading that way hoping that i was correct.<br/>
<br/>
i was correct. but the bridge that i thought was definitely <br/>
the "small people only bridge" was not correct. it was another one.  <br/>
and since i wasn't stressed out about all of the people around and <br/>
having to jump around to keep from going in my pants :-), i spotted <br/>
the R.C. right away and could have kicked myself...well i DID kick <br/>
myself....for not seeing it the first time!<br/>
<br/>
the horse of course box is in very good shape. not too many <br/>
visitors, so there was plenty of room left in the log.  since the <br/>
morning was quiet, i took the time to look at all of the stamps and <br/>
from where they were from.  lot's of out-of-staters. <br/>
<br/>
so this was stamp #29 for me.  woo! woo!<br/>
<br/>
i attempted to head to the second the stamp but got lost AGAIN! so i <br/>
called it quits (my lunch hour was over anyway) and will atempt to <br/>
find the second box on my next trip to louisville.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the adventure cockle-doodle-moo 4H club!<br/>
<br/>
if any of you are planning to find this box i strongly suggest that <br/>
you get a map of the park, especially a map showing the roads! it's <br/>
a beautiful park. louisville is very fortunate to have it.<br/>
