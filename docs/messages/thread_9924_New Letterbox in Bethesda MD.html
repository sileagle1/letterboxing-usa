Burning Tree Park, Bethesda, MD, Montgomery County <br/>
placed by D and Shoo, December 29, 2002<br/>
Difficulty: easy<br/>
<br/>
Burning Tree Park is adjacent to Burning Tree School.  For students' <br/>
security, please try to avoid coming to this letterbox during lunch/recess <br/>
(12-1:30 pm) on school days.  (You'll also find it easier to park on <br/>
non-school days.) Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
You can get this letterbox on the way to or from Lily of the Valley.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495), take River Road (Exit <br/>
39) east.  Turn left on Beech Tree Road.  Turn left into Burning Tree School. <br/>
(Access is restricted during drop-off/pick-up hours.  Park on the street <br/>
during those times.)  The park is to the right of the school. <br/>
