Martha By Mail #2!<br/>
Just in time, too, since we are about 3/4 of the way through a major kitchen <br/>
remodel. <br/>
<br/>
I haven't dared to open the actual letterbox until I do a little tidying up <br/>
around here... that way she has room to work. I'll let you all know when I <br/>
send her on her way and tell you all about the fabulous touches that I'm <br/>
sure she will have added to my humble abode. :) <br/>
