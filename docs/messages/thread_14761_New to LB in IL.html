<br/>
I, too, read the article in Family Fun Magazine and my kids (8 &amp; 10)<br/>
and I are already hooked!  We haven't carved our own stamps yet, but <br/>
have already found 4 letterboxes in our Chicago area!  Already LB <br/>
words have crept into our vocabulary and the kids are trying to think <br/>
of good spots to place their own boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Question: Are HHs obvious?? We found a box yesterday that had an <br/>
extra stamp in it, but there was nothing with it to describe it as a <br/>
HH and it did not have its own notebook.  At first, due to its small <br/>
size, we thought it was a piece that separated from the main stamp, <br/>
but when examined, it appeared to be its own stamp. We didn't know if <br/>
it was a HH or not so we left it there.  The kids wanted me to post <br/>
this question because the thought of leaving a HH behind is <br/>
absolutely horrifying to them! They want to go back and get it if it <br/>
is.<br/>

You are correct in assumng that there'd normally be some indication <br/>
if a second stamp like this was a hitchhiker.  Usually, it would have <br/>
a name somewhere on it (xxx Hitchhiker), be in a separate baggie or <br/>
container of some type, and would have its own log book -- not <br/>
necessarily a large one, maybe even just a folded piece of paper.  <br/>
Hopefully, there'd also be a brief instruction explaining that the <br/>
hitchhiker should travel from box to box.<br/>
