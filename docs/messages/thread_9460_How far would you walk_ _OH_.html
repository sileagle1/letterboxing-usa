How far would you walk to find 44 letterboxes.  Our Team Placed 44 <br/>
Letterboxes in 4.2 mile strech of trail.  It's a Horse trail so<br/>
it's not flat BUT on the other hand it's not real hard, Just alot of ups and <br/>
downs and rocks.  The kicker is; to get all of them, You have to walk back <br/>
the 4.2 miles as that is the closest way back to the car.<br/>
<br/>
(8.4 total miles)or 44,740ft  or if you walk from home plate at Riverfront <br/>
(Before it's torn down) to dead center field wall 112 times, You will have <br/>
walked it all  (WOW)<br/>
<br/>
We will upload the clues after we get them all written up and placed<br/>
on the site (alot of Writting)  :O)<br/>

Good lord, that's a freaking lot of letterboxes!  I'd walk 8.4 miles <br/>
in a heartbeat just to nab ONE letterbox.  Actually, to tell you the <br/>
truth, I probably wouldn't bother trying to get ALL 44 in one <br/>
outing.  It would drive me nuts having to stop every five minutes to <br/>
log another one in.  In fact, it would probably take longer logging <br/>
into 44 letterboxes than it would take to hike the 4.2 miles and back!<br/>
<br/>
But wow, 44 letterboxes.  It took me SEVEN MONTHS to hide that many!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you'd probably have to hike a few hundred miles to nab my <br/>
first 44!  =)<br/>
