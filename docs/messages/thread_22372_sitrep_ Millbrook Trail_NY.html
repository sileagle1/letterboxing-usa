	This is a quick account of our Sunday check on the Millbrook LB.  At<br/>
first we were not sure if there would be any hits since it was planted on<br/>
this New Years day but was pleasently surprised to find many had stamped<br/>
in. Looks like the stamp we use for our own (a bought one) is also used<br/>
by another[LW]. It is the "Moon and shooting stars" stamp.  That's ok<br/>
though, we can share that one......An interesting note in the log in was<br/>
one that<br/>
said.............................................................."Took<br/>
your stamp.....................................................logged in<br/>
on April 1st.....April Fool's....Ha! ........Thanks for those extra<br/>
Zip-Lock bags that were included in the box!.....We stumbled on to a new<br/>
trail in the "Gunks" that lead back to the lower parking lot (marked<br/>
Yellow) and there were plenty of blueberries that we stopped to pick for<br/>
a delicious pie tonight.<br/>
