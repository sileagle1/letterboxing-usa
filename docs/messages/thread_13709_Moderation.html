volunteer to moderate this group, if it would help to have a few more <br/>
folks available.   Just let me know.  This is a big, very active, <br/>
message group!  I'm happy to be able to give back a bit!  :)<br/>
<br/>
For now, I think everyone has their knickers in a twist.  I can <br/>
understand being offended by the file Anne mentioned.  I can also <br/>
understand folks being offended by the recently posted files that <br/>
were derogatory toward geocachers.  All of those files should be <br/>
removed and those members either restricted from posting files, or <br/>
banned from the list.<br/>
<br/>
So - let's stop all the bickering, the flaming accusations, the wild <br/>
presumtions, and let's get back to boxing (as someone else posted).<br/>
