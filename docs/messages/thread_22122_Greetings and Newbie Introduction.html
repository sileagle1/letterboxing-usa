<br/>
My daughter and I just returned from our first Letterboxing treasure <br/>
hunt and had a wonderful time.  We went to Lake Wheeler in Raleigh, <br/>
NC and found our first boxes.  The first having a HitchHiker!  What a <br/>
wonderful surprise!!<br/>
<br/>
All of the boxes at the lake had store-bought stamps except the <br/>
first, but it made no difference to us.  Our stamp was store bought <br/>
too....But now that we have the bug we will have to make our own <br/>
signature stamps!  But first we are going to plant a box... on the <br/>
ride home we discussed just where it will be.  We visited a State <br/>
Park that's closer to home and decided that's where it will go.... We <br/>
want to do it fast (next weekend) so the Hitchhiker has a chance to <br/>
travel soon, so our box will also have a store bought stamp to begin <br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
I found the Atlas Quest website and the LBNA website and looked for <br/>
other letterboxes in our area.  I didn't really see a lot.  Does <br/>
anyone have any suggestions for other places to find area boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the fun!  Happy hunting!<br/>

Speaking as someone with no artistic talent myself, I'll say that I'm <br/>
happy I jumped in and tried it. It's perfectly fine if your stamps are <br/>
simple - the handcarved appearance makes them more fun than you  might <br/>
think. None of my stamps will rival those by really good <br/>
carvers/artists, but for me it's much more fun to release a handcarved <br/>
stamp than one I bought at a store. And, while I enjoy finding any <br/>
stamp, there is an extra dollop of fun in finding a box containing a <br/>
stamp someone took the time to carve, even if it's "just" a <br/>
line-drawing sort of thing. The fact that the planter took the time to <br/>
create something for me to find is really cool.......<br/>
<br/>
Jump in! The carving's fine. :-)<br/>

think of yourself as "artsy" IS intimidating - so<br/>
think of carving as self-expression.  It really makes<br/>
it much easier to get past the first little "what do I<br/>
carve" and "I can't possibly..." thinking.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I smiled at your self-deprecation.  I think most of us feel that way as <br/>
we begin.  I really am not at all an artist.  Stick figures are a <br/>
challenge, but I have come to feel I am a pretty decent carver.  The <br/>
trick is time doing it and finding some good patterns.  I love looking <br/>
around in various places for fun images that I can copy and turn into <br/>
stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I have the carving down, if I could just get the creative <br/>
part.  I would love to be able to design my own . . . that's more <br/>
intimidating.  I will have to start giving it some tries.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck as you begin.  It is fun! I promise!<br/>
