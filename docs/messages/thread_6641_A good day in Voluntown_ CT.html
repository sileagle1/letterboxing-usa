<div><em>Hello all ~</em></div>
<div><em></em> </div>
<div><em>Did a little birthday Letterboxing 
on Wednesday since my mom and niece were visiting and were very interested in 
our new hobby.  We hit up the Pachaug State Forest and found both of 
the "Red Roses For You" boxes and the "Father's Day Flowers".  
(All three are in excellent condition).  Red Roses threw us for a "root 
loop" the first try as we just walked right by it!  We were about to give 
up when my niece looked down and said "is this what a root loop looks 
like?"  She had found her first Letterbox and is now 
hooked.</em></div>
<div><em></em> </div>
<div><em>We were on our way to do "Misery 
Loves Company" but the horse flies were so bad the kids were running and 
screaming in all directions.  We put it off for another 
day.</em></div>
<div><em></em> </div>
<div><em>Heading out again tomorrow to 
Bozrah and Lyme.  </em></div>
