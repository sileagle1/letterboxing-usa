<br/>
Recently on some of my letterboxing ventures I've been too scared to enjoy the hunt.  I have even left before finding the treasure.  I know I'm am hypersensitive to danger and try to stiffle my fear.  But still the pessimist in me seems to win.<br/>
<br/>
I'm amazed that some people can get to 100, 500, 1000+.  I'm at 50 and am ready to quit.  Or maybe just P not F.  And maybe just one P.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if others experience this fear.  How do you stiffle that fear enough to enjoy the hobby.  I know some of the obvious for a paranoid person like I, do only drive by's, go with a buddy, carry a cell.  But I wondering if all you have a bit of fear in you?  When you leave the deep, dark woods unscathed do you feel brave... or lucky...<br/>

Good day to the rest of you.  <br/>
<br/>
I felt empowered to sit down this evening and respond to some of the <br/>
comments that have been made here on the board. First and foremost I <br/>
commend you Fisher for your frankness, and honesty. I can understand <br/>
how some people have an overpowering feeling of fear of going-out <br/>
alone, unguarded from the tribulations that can sneak up on us as a <br/>
cold breeze on a moonlit night. But what you are asking is an honest <br/>
question and I think a feeling that many do, or have, experienced. <br/>
<br/>
I do not believe that I could have said it better than Hoope was able <br/>
to, and I would listen to her suggestions. I too strongly believe <br/>
that we cannot live our lives fulfilled and with satisfaction if we <br/>
hide and cower from the 'darkness' and 'shadows' that this world <br/>
carries. If we were to even being to do that we would never be able <br/>
to leave our homes, for example if I walked out this very moment <br/>
there could indeed be a car that would hit me as I crossed the <br/>
street. Instead we live our lives as just thatours. I believe and I <br/>
am sure that many others here believe that letterboxing brings more <br/>
fulfillment into this precious life that we have. So I would <br/>
encourage you to not let such an outstanding gift to yourself go <br/>
unnoticed or fall to the wayside. <br/>
<br/>
Why do we enjoy letterboxing so much? Why do we overcome some of our <br/>
fears to take up this hobby? I am reminded every day that I am able <br/>
to step into the forest what I have experienced over and over again. <br/>
Peace, harmony, togetherness, and the wonders of nature. I recall <br/>
something that was written some time ago about my `spiritual' <br/>
experience of being out `there', and because I have a Tribal Native <br/>
heritage I become somewhat symbolic so I ask that you bear with me <br/>
for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
"As I slowly walk in this warm-blooded, vibrant, lush, green forest <br/>
fragrant with the scents of cedar, pine and a plethora of flowers all <br/>
tenderly kissing my senses, I inhale the pungent, pleasing scent of <br/>
earth enfolding me in Mother Earth's loving embrace. All that <br/>
surrounds me pulsates and ripples with the melodious rhythms of life. <br/>
<br/>
As I stand contemplatively in the midst of this unending beauty, my <br/>
senses pause, absorbing the exotic, intoxicating, beauty of it all. <br/>
As I see sister cedar tree I feel her spiritual heartbeat bursting <br/>
with rich, robust life. I feel that she is strong and happy. Gazing <br/>
at her I see her uncompromising strength, her magnificent size speaks <br/>
to my soul telling me she has stood sentinel here for many, many <br/>
moons.<br/>
<br/>
Listening to all of Mother Earths voices, I hear my feathered <br/>
relations singing and nesting, bringing new life forth from the <br/>
safety of sister cedars luxuriant hair. Her sweet, gently spirit <br/>
speaks to my soul of spiritual freedom and honoring of what the true <br/>
nature of our world is. "Protect and treasure it" are the words and <br/>
feelings flowing into my soul that sister cedar has spoken to me.<br/>
<br/>
Breathing deeply of the acoustically scented air, the sacred cedar's <br/>
breath calms, cleanses, blesses and bolsters my spirit, giving me <br/>
clarity of thought and renews my inner being. <br/>
<br/>
As I ask myself what can I do to preserve this feeling that I have, <br/>
this calmness, this togetherness, this joy of being out away from all <br/>
of the stress, heartache, and pain of our modern world. The East wind <br/>
blows and you hear---Much--Much"<br/>
<br/>
For me personally a part of that is letterboxing, it is a time that I <br/>
can enjoy the oneness and togetherness of ether myself, my friends, <br/>
or my family along with the world that is around me during those <br/>
moments. It is a time that I can take on a new task, and accomplish <br/>
it at my own pace without the pressures of daily life. Will I allow <br/>
my fear of the dangers of society conquer me? Hardly, and I am sure <br/>
none of us have that desire to ether, when we consider what will be <br/>
lost if we let it fall. Perhaps this is overly dramatic, and if you <br/>
feel that it has been so then I sincerely apologize. I am of the <br/>
opinion that sometimes we forget why we are letterboxing to begin <br/>
with, it is not about how many boxes we have found, how long we have <br/>
been doing it for. Or ever how many miles we have hiked uphill in the <br/>
snow both ways. Those things are not what it is about in my most <br/>
simple and heartfelt opinion. It is about getting back to things that <br/>
we enjoy, the simple pleasures of life, and the challenge of <br/>
conquering our fears even if that is stepping out our front door into <br/>
the unknown, and freeing our spirit. <br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well in everything that you do.<br/>

Yes, I feel the same way.<br/>
<br/>
When I step into the forest and lose myself in its beauty and <br/>
splendor, it's as if the forest is speaking to me saying "Welcome <br/>
home!". It is where my soul feels most at peace.<br/>
