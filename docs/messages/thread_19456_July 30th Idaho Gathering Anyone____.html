                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings Fellow Letterboxers some who live close to me and some who <br/>
live not so close.<br/>
<br/>
We have a rare treat coming up on Friday, July 30th in that Silver <br/>
Eagle and Baby Bear (both letterboxers from Texas) are passing <br/>
through the Boise area and would like to meet as many of us as <br/>
possible.  So if you're available that night to meet and greet please <br/>
let me know.<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking maybe meeting at my place in Star that night around 7pm. <br/>
I can provide home made pizza and we can exchange stamps and meet.  <br/>
<br/>
I will be out of town 16-25 July on a short missions trip down to <br/>
Mexico so if you email me, don't be sad that I haven't written you <br/>
back as I'll be back the 25th and able to correspond again then.  <br/>
<br/>
So email me if you're interested. and I can arrange it.  Thanks so <br/>
much.  Also if you know of other letterboxers that might be <br/>
interested let me too.    <br/>
<br/>
Have a blessed day.<br/>
Aryn Alyssa  (aka A-Bear)<br/>

How goes it?  I'm headed to Mexico this week so will be passing <br/>
through s. CA on a huge non AC'd church bus so I'll wave to all the <br/>
Letterboxes and y'all as I pass by.  =-) <br/>
<br/>
Where is Roberts?  Silver Eagle and Baby Bear are just passing <br/>
through to and from Glacier NP, but flying in and out of Boise area.  <br/>
Hope you're well.<br/>
