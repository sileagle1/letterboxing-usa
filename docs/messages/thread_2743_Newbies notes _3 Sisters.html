                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi All, welcome to all you new folks. You are going to love this! A <br/>
quick note to  Lone Mass Wolf The cowboy and I were at the 3 Singing <br/>
Sisters on  Good Friday all was well  except the early demise of a <br/>
blue jay at the site of the box. <br/>
    The stamp size guideline to fit the 3x5 card was good that would <br/>
do at almost everybox I've seen. <br/>
    The winter gathering was my project. I had met no one in the <br/>
group and all through this talk list we were able to gather 50 of us <br/>
for a day. We had 4 boxes for the day only. We had a stamp for the <br/>
event only available that one day. The hitch hiker Cat on the Prowl <br/>
was turned loose at the gathering. We all exchanged stamp images and <br/>
marveled as we put faces with the marks we had seen in many log books <br/>
on the trial. We had a great potluck type meal and a stamp carving <br/>
contest. We played a few group games at the end which created lots of <br/>
laughs. It was  a great time. <br/>
  Another  event will run in conjunction with the Tolland County 4-H <br/>
fair this August 10,11,12. All details to follow soon. It will be at <br/>
the same location of Vernon, Ct. It will be a drop in and find the <br/>
boxes and collect the event image as I will be busy with the 4-H <br/>
program. There is a nominal parking fee but the kids will love this <br/>
little  hometown type fair. <br/>
   Also a note many boxes are doable by the little people. I often <br/>
rate mine or you can tell  by the clues howeasy they might be. Come <br/>
to Mansfield, ( Ct. ) if you would like to try some.  Happy hunting <br/>
everyone and welcome again.    Leader of the pack<br/>

great time.  It will be here before you know it.  I loved my 4-H days.<br/>
Won't say how long ago, but it seems like yesterday.  See you at the<br/>
fair.<br/>
