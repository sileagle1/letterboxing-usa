and only 10 boxers have stamped in in 10 months.  I don't think we have to<br/>
worry about too much traffic wearing a trail.  Now's a good time to check it<br/>
out.  The weather is still warm and there's no admission to the park since<br/>
it's after Labor Day weekend.  So if you're in the area give it a shot.<br/>

I just picked up Mount Minsi in PA. last Sunday.  Now I have both sides of<br/>
the Delaware Water Gap.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing,<br/>
