 I've heard there's a Floaty Guy Hitchhiker out there which may or may not be traveling with a copy of the CD, "A Magnificent Man."  If I recall, it was launched when the CD came out a few years ago.<br/>
<br/>
There's another box in SC that was planted in honor of the latest CD, "The Haunting" in which fans bought packages to underwrite the cost of making the CD.  Cool way to get fan involvement and produce a CD.  Where you one of the underwriters?<br/>
<br/>
What kind of Floating Men themed stamps have you done?  I'd love to find them!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As far as limiting the PLBs to known "good" users or recommended ones, doesn't that preclude increasing the numbers and exclude newbies that may be just as responsible?  Also downplays "clique-y-ness."  PLBs are much like a planted box, where you take your chances, I would think.  Yes, I plant boxes, saying goodbye to them, believing its just a matter of time before they go MIA.<br/>

I helped out a little with underwriting the last few CDs.  They <br/>
usually send out some cool goodies to the people who help.  I love my <br/>
old-school metal lunch box!  I've carved stamps themed off their <br/>
songs "Poacher's Daughter" and "Over the Wateree" as well as the Jeff <br/>
Black song "Bless My Soul".  I'm considering stamps for the Floating <br/>
Men songs "East of the Sunrise", "Rocket to the Moon", "Tall Stand of <br/>
Pines" and maybe even a three stamp set from the cover of "Heroes, <br/>
Felons and Fiends".  I started one based on "The Rude Hitchhiker" a <br/>
couple years ago, but wasn't satisfied with the design and was afraid <br/>
of offending some of the younger letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
I would LOVE to find the Floaty Guy hitchhiker!<br/>
