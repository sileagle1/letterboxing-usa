to say something.<br/>
<br/>
Morgun, i hope your listening. when i first met you, you seemd like <br/>
such a nice guy. you were inviting and a wonderful person to talk to <br/>
and hang out with for a bit, but then i got to thinking. you need to <br/>
chill man. the reason no one came to your gathering is because it <br/>
sounded to much like a gathering. not many people wanted to come <br/>
probably because it was a sunday. people do work on mondays. no one <br/>
at the gathering promoted your after party because they had thier <br/>
hands full. you complained and i listened. the more i thought about <br/>
it, you couldn't do what they did. i couldn't do what they did. it <br/>
take a lot of guts to pull a gathering like that off and be able to <br/>
sleep at night afterwards. get over it! also, as nice as it sounded, <br/>
i didn't have a clue what i was doing being a co organizer of the <br/>
after party. i did nothing and when people looked at me for some <br/>
direction as to what i going on, i hadn't a clue. that wasn't my <br/>
fault. you were inexperienced, and i got dragged into it. ask next <br/>
time! K!<br/>
Second, as much as i do appreciate the praise you have given me for <br/>
my boxing abilties, i dont need them. let everyone else figure it <br/>
out for themselves. the praise you have given was shortly slammed by <br/>
yourself when i mentioned that, yes i am probably the most active <br/>
placer at this moment, BUT, when i mentioned that there are others <br/>
that can and are willing to help as well, you turn around and play <br/>
all techical lingo with a question, that isn't so hard to answer in <br/>
simple form. i answered a question just fine and you go ahead and <br/>
try and out do me by answering with right and wrong ways to handle a <br/>
HH. you have been boxing for a shorter time than i have. Let someone <br/>
else answer the questions that you can't answer without sounding <br/>
like a prick. when you did that to me, im sorry, but i took it <br/>
personnal.<br/>
Then, the whole thing with the mainekokopellian, was blown way out <br/>
of preportion by myself, was chilled quickly. why would you ever <br/>
bring something like that up again. did you do it to nerve me, <br/>
because you did. after starting something that wasn't ment to be <br/>
started, i apoligized for it and we both moved on. you should never <br/>
start something that is not there to start.<br/>
<br/>
some time ago, i had my share of issues. springchick, i know your <br/>
out there, if i didn't say it then, im saying it now. I'm Sorry. I <br/>
can not let someone sit there and bash the boxing community for <br/>
thier misunderstanding. morgun, your misunderstood. springchick, <br/>
mainekokopellian, your not! we are here to respect everyone. read <br/>
what is written by them. learn from them. if something doesn't go <br/>
your way, don't talk about them behind thier backs. that is so <br/>
elementary school. i was misunderstood back in the day. now look at <br/>
me. i had problems with others and now i am defending them. i am not <br/>
perfect and i still have a lot to learn. so do may others in this <br/>
wonderful hobby. the people you meet here or on the trail or at a <br/>
gathering, should all be your friends. when they turn around, dont <br/>
stab them in the back. that again, shows how misunderstood you are, <br/>
and how much better we are.<br/>
<br/>
i dont plan on getting much positive feedback for this post. in fact <br/>
it would not suprise me if i were kicked from this group. i will <br/>
always visit here and see what is up, but never disappear.<br/>
<br/>
thanks everyone for getting me on my way.....<br/>
