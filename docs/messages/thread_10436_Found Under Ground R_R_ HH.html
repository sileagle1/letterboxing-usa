<div><span class="290452423-23012003">Got home today a 
little early today and took Molly for a walk down the old Air Line RR Trail. We 
walked (and Molly played chase the stick) up to my "Ghost Train" letterbox. I 
thought I would check it and head back before it got too dark. It was about 5 
degrees out there without the wind chill factor. To my surprise we found the 
"Underground Railroad" hitchhiker. It's been sitting there since Nov 19 so I 
took it home and will relocate it soon. Here is the history of the HH as I 
understand it from the log book. </span></div>
