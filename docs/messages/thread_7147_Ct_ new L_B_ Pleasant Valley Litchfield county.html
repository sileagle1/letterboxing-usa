Directions: take route 44 west from Avon-Canton, turn north on route 181<br/>
and follow American Legion Forest signs. When 181 intersects with route<br/>
318, go straight across onto West River Road heading north towards<br/>
Riverton. At 2.7 miles you'll see a large boulder on the left side of the<br/>
road and a brown and yellow sign for the Henry R. Buck Trail. Fishermen<br/>
have made several turn-off parking areas on the left side of the road.<br/>
0.3 miles north of this sign is the trail outlet sign where you will exit<br/>
after finding the box. The clues are written to be followed from the<br/>
southern entrance.<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: This is a 2 mile loop, pretty steep going up, easy coming<br/>
down, clues: easy<br/>
<br/>
Follow the blue blazes the whole way and you can't go wrong. As you leave<br/>
the road it's a steep climb through the forest but it does level out with<br/>
large rocks on your right. After going through a bramble covered path you<br/>
again go uphill on a very rocky path till you come to large rock cliff<br/>
where the trail turns left and goes over a quaint stone bridge, coming<br/>
upon an old foundation on the left and then a wooden bridge. After a<br/>
short downhill you climb a set of stairs to a huge rock face with a<br/>
dedication plaque up very high, on your right is a rock "bench" to sit<br/>
and catch your breath and if you have VERY long arms you can reach behind<br/>
you for the treasure. But those of you with short arms may have to<br/>
scramble around to the back side of the sitting area.<br/>
After stamping in and rehiding carefully, keep going on the trail to the<br/>
road. The trip down is pretty uneventful except for one surprising uphill<br/>
and an "elbow" tree on your left. Walk carefully along the road to your<br/>
car and I hope you had as much fun finding this as I had planting it.<br/>

The Take Only Pictures letterbox is an add on to The Leave Only<br/>
Footprints letterbox.  This should have been sent in as a 2 boxer (am I<br/>
inventing words?) but I never thought of it till in the middle of the<br/>
night as I awoke with letterboxing on my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the directions for Leave Only Footprints and after stamping in<br/>
continue on the blue trail, down the "stairs" following the twists and<br/>
turns that bring you to the  final uphill stretch after which the trail<br/>
levels out and begins a gradual decent. Just before the "elbow" tree find<br/>
a large, flat boulder which could be a picnic table, to the west side of<br/>
the boulder under a chunk of a log you will find the second letterbox.<br/>
Going over the top of the boulder might just be the easiest (and funnist)<br/>
way to get to it. Stamp in, re hide carefully, continue to the road where<br/>
your car is parked.<br/>
