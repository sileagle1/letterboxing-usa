That's what I like about it too!  I have found literally dozens of little hideaways nearby that are great for short hikes -- especially now that we have our new puppy (brought him home Friday). <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to encourage you to place a box!  I started LBing last summer, and this summer I summoned some courage and placed a Stampeaz order.  I started out by carving new personal stamps for me and the boys (three: ages 2, 5, and almost-8) -- we used the ArtGum ones to get started, but I was very frustrated by that carving medium.  I was surprised by how nice MasterCarve and sharp tools are!  Carving was not as hard as I feared, either.<br/>
<br/>
We have placed two boxes so far -- I do the carving and general site selection, and the boys help me scout around and decide on clues.  So far we have chosen "driveby" spots as opposed to hikes -- this is mostly because I wanted to share some neat bronze statues with LBers in my area.  The side benefit is that the boxes are easy to check on -- we drive by the locations every day on our regular errands, so we regularly stop for a minute to see who has come and gone.  <br/>
<br/>
The neatest part is that the boys have started to learn the personal stamps of people in our area, so it's extra cool to see familiar stamps appear in our logbooks.  <br/>
