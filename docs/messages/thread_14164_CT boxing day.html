                    <div class="plaintext-content">we did Bluebird's papermill Anniversary series that starts with a <br/>
geocache/letterbox combo-- how neat!!! That series is 5 and we also <br/>
got Hammonasset River Box which is on the same trail.  We got back to <br/>
the car just as it started to rain-phew!!! A great series of <br/>
birdhouse stamps. We hadn't been out for awhile, and it sure seemed <br/>
good to be back at it-- we now have found 152- and just since <br/>
March!!! Happy Boxing everyone-- S.+ S.Y.+ T.D.<br/>

HIll is a great series.  We spent 2 1/2 hours there!! Great hiking.  <br/>

Avery Point.  All boxes were in great shape, with many wonderful <br/>
handcarved stamps. Thanks to all!! Sunshine, Swamp Yankee, and the <br/>
