This is a quick box (if you park at the right end of Nottoway Park--<br/>
which I didn't!) and was fun to find last night.  It was a little <br/>
damp inside, but the logbook and stamp were fine.  Quick swipe and a <br/>
new ziplock were all it needed.<br/>
<br/>
It was surprisingly under-found, compared to the other BeMa logbooks <br/>
in the area.  Maybe a dozen hits in over a year, and only 3 or so in <br/>
the past 6 months.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you want a quick find in a nice park:  <br/>
