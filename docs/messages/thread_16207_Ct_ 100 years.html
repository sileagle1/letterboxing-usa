Aren't we lucky here in Ct. not only to have so many letterboxers who<br/>
plant and hunt, but we also have a great Forest and Park System that<br/>
is so supportive. Thanks to all , the carvers and planters and hikers.<br/>
It was a fun day.  What else can I leave in the forest?  First my keys<br/>
in deep snow found by Molly, then my walking stick in the deep forest!<br/>
found by Needeeps and Preach, and yesterday, after taking my butterfly<br/>
hat off to toss on my poncho,I hiked off without my hat, only to be<br/>
found later  by The Toad Dog, my new friend. I love Dogs !!  Swamp<br/>
Yankee and Sundshine took a picture of Toad and I hope they share it .<br/>
Good Dog.<br/>
Butterfly<br/>
