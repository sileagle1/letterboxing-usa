Thanks for bringing this up! Your yahoogroup moderators (Randy, Autumn, <br/>
MikeS, and myself) kicked this notion around a couple of weeks ago and decided that <br/>
these "new pix here" posts were more nuisance than spam. There have been <br/>
about a dozen of them lately, and they seem to be a problem across the board <br/>
(*ahem, sorry*) at yahoogroups. There is always the option of first-post moderating <br/>
here at letterbox-usa, but we didn't take it in this case.<br/>
<br/>
Not speaking for the group, I personally think moderation is a mistake. Lists <br/>
that require please-may-I-join application to a single autocrat are <br/>
patronizing. Lists that are based on a single premise and that heavily censor for <br/>
content suppress free speech and the ebb and flow of ideas that make life more <br/>
interesting. I hope we never find that here. As an older generation used to say, <br/>
"I disagree with you but will fight to defend your right to express that <br/>
opinion."<br/>
