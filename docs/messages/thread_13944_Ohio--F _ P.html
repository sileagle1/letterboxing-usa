<br/>
Wild Child and I have recently left 3 new boxes in your state--two in Stow <br/>
(NE) and one in Van Wert (NW)--the first in Van Wert County.  <br/>
<br/>
We introduced friends from Danville to LBing by hunting WilloWander's Dawes <br/>
Arboretum LBs.  GREAT clues--we especially enjoyed those to "Commanding View."  <br/>
Alas, the MIA status of the first box appears to be correct--we found a <br/>
glued-on lid on the underside of the bench, but no box attached.  I'm happy to <br/>
report that "Wood, Water, Stone" IS there, tho I had given up after what I thought <br/>
was a thorough search of the site.  Then one of the children we were <br/>
introducing to LBing found it by looking from another angle--hooray for the newbie <br/>
9-year-old!  According to reports in the other log books, this box has thwarted <br/>
several searchers (and apparently it really was missing for a while &amp; has since <br/>
been replaced).  Too bad we'd run out of time when we got to "Trees <br/>
Knees"--we'd have loved to attempt +.  <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to WilloWanders for our first four Ohio finds and helping to <br/>
introduce a local family to our hidden hobby.  Our Danville friends are very busy <br/>
folks, but I'm hoping they will find time to plant boxes of their own for WW <br/>
and others to find!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I tell you Motofranz, it was torture!  There I was in the Cincinnati airport <br/>
for a 2-hour layover--my first delirious thought was that I'd have time to go <br/>
boxing during my wait--my second unhappy realization was that, with the <br/>
be-there-1-hour-before-departure and stand-in-the-long-security-line regulations, <br/>
two hours just WASN'T ENOUGH time!  ARrrrghhhhh!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Luckily for me, Scoutdogs and Wanda were kind enough to interrupt their busy <br/>
boxing to come and exchange stamps with Wild Child and I (our first <br/>
exchanges!).  Turned out we had to run for our plane anyway, since we got so involved <br/>
with our chat...it would have been really embarrassing if we'd missed our flight <br/>
after spending two hours *in* the airport...<br/>
<br/>
But all those boxes--just beyond my grasp!  Not once but twice!--we had <br/>
another layover on our way out of Ohio!   Next time I just might have to plan to <br/>
stay a day or two to get after some of those "hundreds of virgin letterboxes <br/>
waiting to be discovered"! <br/>

Me and the middle child went after a couple of your boxes at Mt. Airy <br/>
after an orienteering event last Saturday. We found Kase Garden with <br/>
a snake on top in good shape. We then found Fishin' - The stamps were <br/>
outside the bag and very wet. We drained the box and were able to get <br/>
2 of the 3 stamps in the bag and got a good seal on the lid. We left <br/>
the rest your boxes for another day. Thanks.....<br/>
