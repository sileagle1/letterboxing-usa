                    <div class="plaintext-content">Alright, with the pathetic weather here in southern New<br/>
England for the last few months (We haven't found a box<br/>
in over a month!), we had a thought... How about compiling<br/>
a list of "winter-accessible" boxes?  Boxes in a place<br/>
such that not only can a person realistically find their<br/>
hiding spots in the winter (so no "look under the third<br/>
flat rock east of the pole" <g>), but that a person can<br/>
*get* to, following the normal clues.  That would exclude<br/>
clues such as small runoff-type streams, most non-obvious<br/>
types of trees and vegitation, anything hidden by snow,<br/>
and quite possibly unblazed trails (depending on the<br/>
surrounding foliage and the obviousness of the trails<br/>
themselves).<br/>
<br/>
As a start, we will say that RIBNAG's "Things to do with<br/>
Stone" hike works in the winter, the trails all appear<br/>
quite obvious and have good blazing, and only one of the<br/>
three boxes would possibly present a problem with snow<br/>
covering it (the first, but not impossible if one very<br/>
carefully follows the directions).<br/>
<br/>
One bit of advice, though... On new-fallen snow, leave<br/>
a *wide* path-of-destruction in the general area of the<br/>
box, or curious people can follow your footprints right<br/>
to it.<br/>

need to give some thought when hiding boxes to what will be happening in the<br/>
winter.  It's been good for us to be frustrated by the snow and will<br/>
hopefully make us think about that come spring when we'll be ready to put<br/>
out some boxes in Cheshire.Always learning... Ann T.<br/>
