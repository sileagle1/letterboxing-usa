the box.  Judging by the instructions it didn't seem like it would be<br/>
hard to find (after braving the poison ivy).  There aren't that many<br/>
juniper bushes...  Has anyone noticed its absence or did we just miss<br/>
it?  My husband was the only one with long pants on so he did all the<br/>
searching.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we did the Island Sanctuary box.  My husband, a life long Rhode<br/>
Islander, never even knew the area existed.  We were there at sunset<br/>
and it was beautiful at the outlooks.<br/>

Sorry, Trish. It is indeed gone, but with some help from our friends <br/>
we hope to have it replaced soon. Jay<br/>

Just putting some finishing touches on the Fort Wetherill stamp.  It <br/>
will be on it's way up north very soon.  <br/>
