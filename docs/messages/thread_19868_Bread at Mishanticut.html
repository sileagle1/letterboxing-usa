You must have been there right before us!  We couldn't find it today and I <br/>
looked for the clues to contact you and they had been pulled from the site.  It <br/>
looked like a place maybe some kids had been hanging around.  They were <br/>
peeling the bark from the logs they were sitting on  :(   That's our 4th box in a <br/>
row that was MIA.  My daughter is getting a bit disappointed but we will box <br/>
on!!  :)  I have 3 boxes and a HH to place but obviously I'm leery about it.  <br/>
Just need to make sure I hide them very well.<br/>

<br/>
Yet another reason to stop feeding the geese and ducks!  It's bad enough that the poop has killed that little lake, but it seems now the fowl creatures go looking for food containers when they can't get enough of that yummy white nutritionally devoid stuff we don't see fit to serve the family.  I can just imagine some glutton goose with a chunk of white eraser stuck in its neck. Serves him right. <br/>
<br/>
But seriously, I hadn't gone to Mishanticut to find your box because I haven't the time right now.  Even if I had the time, thought of what the path looked like last time I was there just makes me very sad. That little area, though, must be quite the attraction for local kids and teens.  The friend that introduced me to the place pointed out the spot where she lost her virginity.  (Way too much info for me!!)  So I would imagine even the best looking hiding places in that place get visited by people doing things they probably shouldn't be doing.  And there is a parking lot to the high school right next door, right?  You may have to just abandon this place for letterboxing. Sorry to hear you lost your stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
But, Hey!  On a brighter note, I hear someone is going to make a LB for BrianGreenDragon.  You could offer to carve up that one...   ;-)<br/>
