                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was wondering if there is someplace where people can verify how <br/>
recently a letterbox was last found. Something that is no online <br/>
maintenance for the people who host the letterbox, or at least the <br/>
letterbox clue url. <br/>
<br/>
I found letterboxing through geocaching, and I am somewhat spoilt by <br/>
the ability to verify that the stash is still there without having to <br/>
email the stash host.<br/>
<br/>
let me know how you've resolved this in the past.<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Julia,<br/>
Glad you found the Heron!!  People often post to this list and/or to <br/>
the person who placed the box if a letterbox is missing, and <br/>
sometimes when it's found. I enjoy hearing that my letterboxes were <br/>
found!<br/>
<br/>
You can usually check the list to see if a box is missing or it may <br/>
be posted on the clue page.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I've received a few notes that the inkpad and pen <br/>
are gone from my boxes. I don't include ink pads in my boxes. Some <br/>
people do and others don't, so it's good to be prepared and carry an <br/>
ink pad and pen!<br/>
<br/>
Hoping my message gets through (last time I posted through the <br/>
website my message "went awol!")<br/>
<br/>
Happy letterboxing,<br/>
Betsey<br/>
in a perfect summer day, Ma.<br/>
