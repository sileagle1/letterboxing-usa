Did the first box by the green bar gate and decided we didn't have <br/>
enough time before I had to go to work to traverse Bluff Point.  <br/>
<br/>
Started on Karen's clues for Haley Farm and got the Chester Cemetary <br/>
box.  The log book for this box if FILLED to the brimn, we actually <br/>
had to back track a few pages and stamp in out-of-order. It appears <br/>
that several non-boxers have signed into this log, which is neat. I'm <br/>
impressed that the box has not been vandalized with the amount of <br/>
finds, this spot appears to be a popular one to...uhh.... reflect? <br/>
With one "group" having a particular fondness for botany... namely <br/>
the Canabis genus according to the drawing (shaking head). Great <br/>
stamp though!!!! <br/>
<br/>
I think we'll try to get back and grab the picnic spot Lb and the <br/>
canopy rock ones this week, might drop off a new log-book for Chester <br/>
Cemetary if either thats satisfactory to the owner or if the box <br/>
owner can't get there soon.  <br/>
<br/>
Up to PFX 98, was actually disappointed we didn't have time to hit <br/>
the 100 mark today as it was a BEAUTIFUL warm sunny, breezy, perfect <br/>
day! <br/>
<br/>
Also made a stop in that general area and dropped the Beaver Crew HH <br/>
off for a continued voyage across Groton. We don't plan on being out <br/>
of the area in the next few days so we decided to let someone else <br/>
have the fun of the find rather than it taking up space in our pack!<br/>
