boxes.  As always letterboxing is taking us to new fun places we <br/>
didn't know about.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoyed Andrew's 10th Birthday in Mashpee<br/>
<br/>
Double checked for boxes just before we left and discovered two new <br/>
boxes in Dennis just posted "that day"!  Will, the Headless Hunter's <br/>
boxes in Dennis are just great.  The Ghost Train, Black Crow at <br/>
Quivet, The Legend of Scargo and the Forgotten Road.  Very <br/>
imaginative clues, interesting stories, fascinating places and nicely <br/>
carved stamps.  Best of all we ran into the Headless Hunter himself, <br/>
and his great family atop the tower!  I had just been noticing <br/>
someone carrying computer printouts when he approached us, "Excuse <br/>
me.  Are you letterboxers?"  It was so cool to meet them and a very <br/>
fortunate exchange since we now have the 'about to be replaced', <br/>
cool, headless hunter stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoyed seeing some friends stamps, like Sadie and Russ and as always <br/>
saw Mary from Virginia beating us to boxes.<br/>
<br/>
We are trying to introduce the MD/DC/VA habit of "coloring stamps" to <br/>
New England.  We use simple Crayola markers to color the stamps with <br/>
and often leave a sample on the page with our stamps.  "Window on the <br/>
Bay", which is already a beautiful stamp, is Very nice in color.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the fun Cape Cod planters.  Watch for Night Owl's new <br/>
box posting soon.<br/>

<giggle> Ambassador Scarab, trying to convert the indigenous <br/>
letterboxers? Bonne chance!<br/>

<br/>
p.s. We like to use Marvy markers for our coloring. Dead Duck Chuck <br/>
is showing a surprising aptitude for artistic ability!<br/>
