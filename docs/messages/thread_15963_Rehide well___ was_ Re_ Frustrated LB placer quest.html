                    <div class="plaintext-content">The lack of effort in rehiding boxes really irks us also! The best <br/>
example I can think of was at Rocky Neck when we ran into Sunshine <br/>
and Swamp Yankee and boxed together for a while. The 5 of us went to <br/>
find a box by the camp office only to find it in plain view from the <br/>
road. Steve also found Wanda and Pete's Pine Barrens box out in the <br/>
open too.... though we think that may have been done by "other" <br/>
mammals, not humans!<br/>
<br/>
Is there a solution? Yes! Encourage people to rehide boxes well. We <br/>
learned from Jay, B'Fly and Patrick/Amy how to rehide well. We think <br/>
that taking a newer boxer out on the trails may be a way to curb <br/>
careless rehiding...they can see how you (the experienced ones!) <br/>
conceal your finds and it is NOT out of line to mention it in <br/>
passing.  Should that not work...then I guess you resort to nasty-<br/>
grams... but thats not pleasant and would likely start battles that <br/>
need not be waged.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line?? I guess just try to instill some of the ethics from <br/>
experienced letterboxers into those folks that are coming up through <br/>
the ranks. Any other comments??<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">CSCM and I often find boxes that are not hidden (or re-hidden) well. <br/>
Sometimes it is just not a great hiding spot for a box, but more often than not I <br/>
think that when the last finder put it back into its hiding place they only looked <br/>
at the hiding place from one direction.<br/>
<br/>
We have found some boxes that when approached from one direction, it is <br/>
completely hidden, but if you look at it from a different angle or come at it from <br/>
a different direction, it's in open view. Sometimes, if we know an area, we <br/>
may not follow the placer's directions exactly. If we come up a trail from a <br/>
different direction, sometimes we see a box from quite some distance.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend to newcomers to, if you can, to walk around a box and make <br/>
sure you can't see it from any angle. <br/>
<br/>
I would also recommend that we, as placers, try to avoid creating hiding <br/>
places that are really obvious. Some piles of rocks or twigs are just too <br/>
suspicious looking. If I was a non-boxer and saw a suspicious pile of rocks, and I <br/>
know it's not a cairn marking a trail, I'd probably check it out. We have stopped <br/>
following the written directions many times to make a beeline to an obvious <br/>
pile of sticks or an out of place rock.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you're placing a box and the area is frequented by families, just <br/>
try to imagine where you would explore if you were a five year old. You climb <br/>
rocks, look into crevices, you want to touch everything. A family with young <br/>
kids is very likely to accidentally come across boxes placed in areas with lots <br/>
of big boulders, caves or cool hollows. <br/>
<br/>
I am interested to hear ideas from others.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just experienced this very problem yesterday.  The box in question<br/>
was far off the trail and lucky for that because when we walked up to<br/>
do a maintenance check, I could see it from about 10' away.  The<br/>
person who had visited it last hadn't bothered to take the time to<br/>
re-hide very well.  It was just shoved part way into the nest and the<br/>
rocks &amp; bark used for cover were not bothered with.  This person has<br/>
been letterboxing longer than us, and in fact said to me that<br/>
letterboxers are not interested in stopping to enjoy the nice views<br/>
along the way, they just want the box. <br/>
<br/>
Now I understand letterboxing is different for everyone and I try to<br/>
respect that.  Just as I want my clues to be accurate, I hope those<br/>
who find my boxes will be kind and take an extra 30 seconds to re-hide<br/>
them safely.  But the fact is that there are some who don't care and I<br/>
don't think there is anything that can be done about it.  For these<br/>
people one could:<br/>
<br/>
- Send an email to the offender?  I don't think it would be well<br/>
received because the offender might not believe it.   Besides, could<br/>
it be proved they did it?<br/>
- Make a request in the clues?  Already have.<br/>
- Educate?  You can make a person read it but you can't make them<br/>
understand it.<br/>
<br/>
It's like when my son was in his terrible 2's: It was easier for me to<br/>
get him to do what I wanted him to do if I changed MY direction of<br/>
attack.  I had to get tricky in my thinking.  <br/>
<br/>
How does this relate to my boxes (and I know this goes beyond the<br/>
initial subject)?  When I look for a spot I try to find the best<br/>
possible spot.  I'm thinking hard rain &amp; the way the water flows,<br/>
floods and how high it gets.  Do kids play here?  Will bushes have<br/>
grown up here in 3 years and will I need to move it? What's it going<br/>
to look like in the winter?  After placing micro-boxes that have been<br/>
chewed and moved by critters, I've learned to think: is this someone's<br/>
home, can someone pull this out and will it roll it down a hill?  Does<br/>
it look like an exotic nut to a squirrel?  Are these rocks heavy<br/>
enough?  <br/>
<br/>
I look for hiding places that cannot be seen from the path or people<br/>
walking by. Is hidden by as many angles as possible.  Is it under or<br/>
in something that is stable, or if it's in something organic that's<br/>
rotting away then I expect to move it at some point and will keep an<br/>
eye on it.  I'm still learning and with every box planted I gain more<br/>
insight.  A friend recently told me that the more boxes I find the<br/>
more I'll learn.  I believe it.  <br/>
<br/>
So I guess it's like a child who grows up and leaves home: I let him<br/>
go and what will be, will be.  Beyond that I just hope.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Personally, I love to re-hide a box better than it was hidden when I <br/>
find it. I consider it a challenge, and I like to make it just a <br/>
little bit harder for the next finder to find it. ;)<br/>
If we all take the "make it harder for the next person" approach, <br/>
maybe we won't have any boxes left out in plan site? <br/>
We found a box this weekend that was under a tree buried with a few <br/>
pine needles. When we left it, you couldn't even see it, but it <br/>
didn't look obvious either. The next person may *never* find it. <br/>

Yes--exactly!  As someone with minimal experience I have so appreciated any<br/>
tips and suggestions shared by the local boxers who have befreinded me!<br/>
That is how I have learned the importance of discretion, careful rehiding<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
And, not to stir the pot, I think this is a really good example of why this<br/>
list needs to be patient and nurturing of new folk.  Yes, we tend to ask the<br/>
same old questions.  At least we are asking and learning--otherwise we would<br/>
just be out there willy-nilly finding boxes with careless abandon.<br/>
