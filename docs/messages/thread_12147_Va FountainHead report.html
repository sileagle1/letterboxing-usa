the whole Scooby gang! It seems as if the last letterboxers though <br/>
were not very good about putting the boxes back. All but shaggy were <br/>
in pretty plain site. Just a reminder... RE HIDE the BOXES WELL! <br/>
<br/>
An update needs to be made to the clues... you do not have to cross <br/>
the stream on a pipe... there are now 2 bridges... very wobbly too! <br/>
<br/>
Also.. the CoffeeBreak HH was released somewhere in Northern VA this <br/>
past week. <br/>
<br/>
Happy Trail,ya'll! <br/>
