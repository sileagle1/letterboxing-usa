&amp; well with all original logs and stamp!  I know Mark Pepe has a list <br/>
of first boxes placed in each state, but it would be fun to know the <br/>
names and ages of the oldest boxes still alive in each state.  <br/>
<br/>
In TX, the first box was gone a long time ago (before I started in <br/>
2002), so the current oldest box is Lost Pines in Buescher State <br/>
Park, placed by Eoghan on 11/04/2000.  The clues are not on LBNA and <br/>
it takes some sleuthing to find them, especially since I'm not sure <br/>
Eoghan still participates.<br/>
<br/>
So how about the rest of you?<br/>

&gt; Just wanted to mention that today is the 9th anniversary of the <br/>
oldest <br/>
&gt; box in Wisconsin! The original placer (a "Steve") planted it on <br/>
&gt; September 26, 1998. He is no longer in the game, but "The Dragon" <br/>
&gt; adopted the box several years ago (as he did with several other <br/>
older <br/>
&gt; boxes in Wisconsin).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The ORIGINAL logbook is still in the box, and 2 other logbooks have <br/>
&gt; been added to the box over time. The original custome-made stamp is <br/>
&gt; also in the box. Over the course of 9 years, 80 different <br/>
&gt; individuals/groups have signed into the logbooks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know this isn't the absolute OLDEST box in the USA, but I think <br/>
it is <br/>
&gt; one of the older ones.  Can anyone provide info on what other boxes <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; older than this one?  <br/>
