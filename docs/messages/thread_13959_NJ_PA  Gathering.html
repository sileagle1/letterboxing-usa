thanking Ed for a great job last Saturday!!   This was our first <br/>
gathering and we really enjoyed it! It was great to see, and receive, <br/>
so many different stamps. <br/>
We were glad that we stamped in on The Mercer Hunt and Ferdinan, <br/>
because our other hunts , Winahawcawchunk and Bowman's Hill left us <br/>
stampless.<br/>
Did anyone else attending the gathering try to find these two boxes? <br/>
We were positive we were in the correct spot for the Winahacawchunk <br/>
Box but no box was there. And at Bowman Hill we attempted twice and <br/>
did not get "a 1/4 way around passing above the weir, pass a tree <br/>
with a trail heading UP hill"??<br/>
Oh well, we did get 3 finds and 18 exchanges !<br/>
It was great fun meeting other boxers! <br/>
Thanks again to Ed for coordinating a great day!<br/>
See you on the trails,<br/>
C,B,and J from NJ<br/>

Hi CB&amp;J!<br/>
<br/>
This is ACE, from the Mercer Meet. The Winahacawchunk - <br/>
Bowman combo was one that my friends and myself were <br/>
thinking of tackling a few weeks ago.<br/>
<br/>
But some early investigation led us to believe that many folks <br/>
were reporting the boxes missing. (Or the clues a bit too fuzzy to <br/>
decipher.)<br/>
<br/>
Then again, we heard rumors that at least *one* of the boxes <br/>
*was* in place, and that the other may have been judged MIA <br/>
prematurely, due to the nature of the clues.<br/>
<br/>
I myself have searched a location for 20-30 mins., being *quite* <br/>
sure that I had the right spot, only to find the box 20-30 yards <br/>
away after some careful backtracking.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the Twilight Zone of Letterboxes. <br/>
(Do-de-do-DE - do de DO)<br/>
<br/>
I can't confirm nor deny *either* of those boxes for you, but I think <br/>
I STILL may go after that Bowman's Hill box one day.<br/>
