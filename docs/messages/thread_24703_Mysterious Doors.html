I may have to make a trip there to look them up.  Really love the craftmanship of the one at the Ark -- I have been there several times over the years and was totally oblivious to a wee folk fairy door.<br/>
<br/>
Other than the one at Gray's Lake, which made the Des Moines paper, there is no indication given of what might be inside the doors, if anything.  Or perhaps is that part of the intrigue?<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm...  thinking of possibilities...<br/>
