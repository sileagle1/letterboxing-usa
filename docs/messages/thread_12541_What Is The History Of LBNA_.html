tried to find Der Mad Stamper when I was hunting for the Golden Spike<br/>
letterbox (the 1st in UT-another reason to txfer boxes to new site-historic<br/>
boxes would be lost).  I had a hard time the first time and emailed him to<br/>
see if he knew if it was MIA.  I found the box after another attempt, but<br/>
never heard from Der Mad Stamper.  What has happened to him?<br/>
