                    <div class="plaintext-content">Quick question about hitchikers! We are planning to place a hitchiker today and since it is my first I wanted to make sure I was doing it right. <br/>
<br/>
It's traveling in its own microbox (a film canister). The outside says the name of it. Inside is a stamp and a rolled up pad of paper. The cover says something to the effect that this is a hitchiker and to contact me if they find it so I may know that is has been found. <br/>
<br/>
Is that all I need to do? <br/>
<br/>
We're leaving soon so if I don't hear from anyone I'll hope that this is the correct way to do it! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Peppermint Patti  &lt;---very excited to plant my first hitchiker!!!<br/>

Sounds good to me. Every HH we've found is different<br/>
from the others. One had it's own container, some had<br/>
ink, some didn't. So long as it says HH on it<br/>
somewhere, so folks realize what it is, go for it. :-)<br/>
