So, I suggest this. If you have placed a box within a few minutes of a major highway (primarily East Coast for now), would you be willing to email me at letterboxing AT bluejena DOT net with the following:<br/>
1. The name of the box<br/>
2. The link from the main site to the clues.<br/>
3. Major highway, exit number, and approximate distance (miles/minutes) to the box.<br/>
4. Actual town and state the box is in.<br/>
5. Optional: if there are any landmarks of note nearby (say, The World's Largest Collection of Dryer Lint, or the childhood home of Bob C. Schmoe, etc.) that would be worth stopping to see.<br/>
<br/>
I will attempt to take on the task of organizing this material.<br/>
