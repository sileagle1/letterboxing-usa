Illinois Beach<br/>

Dead River is so named not because it is polluted, but because it runs toward, but does not flow into, <br/>
Lake Michigan. Just yards from its goal, the river disappears into the sand in an apparent dead end. <br/>
Periodically, the river builds enough pressure to burst its sand bar barricades in a violent outbreak, <br/>
which can be very dangerous to bystanders. Mostly, however, the river snakes placidly from the <br/>
marshes of Dead Lake a mile or two to its dead end on the beach, hardly seeming to flow at all.<br/>
<br/>
To find the Dead River letterbox, start at the Illinois Beach nature center. From the parking lot, <br/>
follow the Dead River Trail. Take this trail past the observation deck, on over a rugged bridge, <br/>
following the banks of the river. Finally you will come to a point where the Dead River Trail turns <br/>
away from the water. Continue along the bank on a smaller side trail. Less than 50 feet along, you <br/>
will come to a group of fallen trees. Examine the last log to find a hollow covered with pieces of bark <br/>
where the box is hidden. Make sure to cover it again when you leave.<br/>
