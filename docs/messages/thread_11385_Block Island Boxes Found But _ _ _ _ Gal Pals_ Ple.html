Well, it was a great boxing weekend on Block Island.<br/>
For those of you who've placed boxes there, we found them all.  The Boy<br/>
Scout Troop 540 from Glastonbury (I have two sons in this troop) biked all<br/>
over the island hunting and seeking boxes and we have the following<br/>
report(s):<br/>
<br/>
1.  Gal Pals:  Please write me directly - I had to move one of the boxes as<br/>
it was submerged.  Stamp undamaged and in good shape, all else, well . . .<br/>
2.  White Rock at Black Rock:  Excellent shape.  Not alot of visitors but<br/>
what a great spot.<br/>
3.  North End:  Lighthouse good shape (book practically full), treasure<br/>
chest excellent shape.<br/>
4.  Indian Cemetery:  Excellent shape, book full, working on extra blank<br/>
pages.<br/>
5.  SE Lighthouse:  Stamp pad needs to be replaced (missing).<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>
<br/>
