                    <div class="plaintext-content">I drove around checking on some of my letterboxes and on reports that <br/>
they were missing.  I was ecstatic to find The Inventor right where <br/>
is should be.  It is odd that the person reporting it missing <br/>
described exactly where it was and that there had been recent <br/>
gardening but he couldn't find it.  The only things I can think of is <br/>
that it was removed and replaced by someone, or it was buried in the <br/>
new mulch.  Anyway since it is probably my best stamp so far I am <br/>
glad it's survived.<br/>
<br/>
Old Boiler in Arlington, VA is indeed missing. It was too exposed. I <br/>
will replace the stamp when I can and find a new hiding place.  The <br/>
river was so high you couldn't see the old boiler at all.  It even <br/>
covered the river path where I was going to investigate a new <br/>
location.<br/>
<br/>
I checked Orion the Hunter in DC.  The microbox was there still <br/>
velcroed to its tree branch.  The log was a little damp but ok.  But <br/>
the stamp was missing.  Even odder there was a weird, weird note in <br/>
the back of the log: <br/>
<br/>
"Maam, You have 37 cents postage due.  I have a phone.  Would you <br/>
like to call me?  I don't do computers because I never have.  Have a <br/>
good day and drop me a line soon.  May 5-21-2003 [signature <br/>
illegible, no phone number given]"  <br/>
<br/>
Did I say weird?  Did some poor shizophrenic street person observe a <br/>
woman letter boxer stamping in and leave her a note?<br/>
<br/>
Well this particular stamp is easily replaced and I will endeavor to <br/>
do so soon.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm delighted that The Inventor is not missing after all. I was <br/>
really bummed at the report that it was gone.  I'm doing the urban <br/>
microboxes workshop at the Great Lakes gathering this Saturday and I <br/>
was planning to use it 1) as the premier example of a secure box in <br/>
an extremely busy location and 2)as proof that a film canister <br/>
doesn't really limit the stamp size as much as you might think. I <br/>
have a bunch of photos of the stamp and the (general)location that <br/>
I'm planning to show.  I hope you don't mind.   It's a great stamp <br/>
and I'm happy it's still there.  I'm sorry about Orion and glad <br/>
you're replacing it.   Keep up the good work.  <br/>
