                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today Joe and I went to search for the "Who is the Author?" series up <br/>
in Doylestown, PA. We found #1 after first overshooting it (we always <br/>
either overshoot or stop too soon!!) and stamped in. #2 we had to <br/>
save for later, because on of the park maintenance trucks and driver <br/>
were right in front of it.<br/>
<br/>
On to #3. Found it easily. We pull out the box and sit down to stamp <br/>
in. As is my custom, I start looking through the logbook and all of <br/>
the people who have stamped in before us. Imagine my surprise when <br/>
all of a sudden, I see Joe's handwriting. Turns out that while I <br/>
thought he was at work for hours yesterday, he drove up to <br/>
Doylestown, scoped out the series, and wrote in the third box <br/>
log: "Hello Kathryn! I know how much letterboxing means to you! So I <br/>
skipped out early and beat you to this one... But while I have you <br/>
here and before our vacation on Saturday: Will you marry me...? Love, <br/>
Joe"<br/>
<br/>
Then he got down on one knee and presented me with a ring. Of course <br/>
I said yes :) <br/>
<br/>
I was shocked, to put it mildly! Especially since I've wanted him to <br/>
propose this way for months, but never actually told him! He thought <br/>
it up all by himself :) <br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd share my happy day with you all!<br/>

it... :)<br/>
