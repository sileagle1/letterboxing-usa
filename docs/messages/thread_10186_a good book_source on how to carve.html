<div>You know you've reached that stage when you're having a great time finding boxes, then making and planting your own and then devising crazy "creative" schemes to make the ones you made stand out or be more interesting when, all of the sudden, you take a look at the ones you've carved (or in our case, remember them because we forgot to make prints for ourselves..) and say -- Ya' know -- there's a lot of room for improvement in the 'ole technique....  So, off to the library and chase around the net.  But, though we've found lots of info. regarding what to do with your nifty stamp once you have it, not one explains how to get it to that nifty state to begin with!  </div>

<div>Any ideas for "how to" sources?  I'd love to learn how to do shading (and cutting a straight line while I'm at it...).  Thanks!  BeMa</div></div></div></div><br clear="all"/><hr/>MSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service:  <a href="http://g.msn.com/8HMEEN/2020">2 months FREE*</a> </body></html>

<br/>
The way I learned to improve my carvings was by asking people who DID <br/>
carve well what their 'secret' was.  Basically one-on-one <br/>
instruction.  That and a lot of practice and you'll be making <br/>
miniture masterpieces in no time.  If you ever go to a letterboxing <br/>
gathering, those are FANTASTIC places to get new <br/>
carving/stamping/letterbox/whatever ideas and tips from others.  <br/>
Don't let another one pass you by without learning something useful <br/>
from it!  =)<br/>
<br/>
I created a webpage some time back with carving tips and suggestions <br/>
I've picked up from others or discovered on my own.  It only has tips <br/>
and pointers--it's not a "how-to" which I felt other websites do a <br/>
great job of explaining much better than I ever could--but assuming <br/>
you've already carved a few stamps, tips and pointers is probably all <br/>
you're really looking for!  You can read them at <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/Docs/Carving but it's really not <br/>
a good substitute for hands-on experience with another carver.<br/>
<br/>
I'd try to point you to other websites, but created this page BECAUSE <br/>
I couldn't find any websites like this!  If you find a better source, <br/>
please let me know!  (I'm always in the market to learn some new tips <br/>
and pointers and create ever more impressive carvings.)<br/>
