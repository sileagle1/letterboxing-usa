<br/>
    We did one half of the Conch Republic, starting in Key West.  We will do<br/>
the other half when we are in the Upper Keys some time.  You will understand<br/>
what I mean by half, when you go to the one in Key West.<br/>
<br/>
    I placed a letterbox while in the Keys.  Will put the clues up very<br/>
soon.<br/>
