Typically I delete these links (esp. with no message).   <br/>
<br/>
But for the sake of myself &amp; newcomers <br/>
....  I assume this and others like it are from our disgruntled friend?<br/>
We can expect most nonsense-like screennames to be deviant?<br/>

Without analyzing them, its impossible to know who they are from.  However,<br/>
my guess (caveat: I don't look at them) is that they are automatically <br/>
generated, and not from a past or present letterboxer.  The technology<br/>
to eliminate this form of abuse is fairly trivial to implement, but Yahoo<br/>
has not done so.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't waste time on them (like we are here :-)).  Configure your mail <br/>
software to kill messages with the subject "check this out", and "new pictures <br/>
here" (shortly, tho, the abuser(s) will change the subject line -- the best<br/>
arms race is one you decline to participate in).  The volunteer list managers <br/>
presently don't have the time to do what it takes to prevent them, so the <br/>
effort of remediating them is presently distributed to all subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We can expect most nonsense-like screennames to be deviant?<br/>
<br/>
Yep.  A good rule of thumb in e-mail is to ignore messages if you don't know<br/>
who the sender is.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The following is somewhat off-topic, but, at least to me, somewhat <br/>
interesting.  It came across another list I subscribe to (where alledged<br/>
censorship vs spam remediation is a hot topic (and an important one, as<br/>
the list is of such a nature that the moderators, I believe, can be held<br/>
liable under anti-trust law for censorship)).  You certainly don't have to<br/>
read it, but the gist is that the proper (and only logical) response to <br/>
unwanted e-mail (be it spam or "hate" or that which offends) is to ignore <br/>
it.  (I don't totally agree with that thesis, but I mostly do -- the <br/>
underlying structure of the thesis is basically right, tho I may not agree <br/>
with some word choice, details, and exceptions.  Anyway, someone else's  <br/>
words, not mine, so don't flame me ... <br/>

A large part of "SPAM" is not a matter of marketing. It is a matter of<br/>
terrorism, where instead of violence, they conduct annoyance.  The persons<br/>
creating the vast bulk of the abuse are people trying to terrorize or<br/>
annoy people into banning spam.  [so and so] said from the start that it <br/>
was his goal to make things worse. He has succeeded: More annoying it is.  <br/>
These people have no real commercial motivation--at least, not with respect <br/>
to the services described in the emails they send. They aren't trying to<br/>
sell anything by email. They are trying to sabotage the system of email, <br/>
and annoy people.  One might wonder who would only want to annoy people, <br/>
and for what purpose, since they are not trying to sell something.<br/>
<br/>
No matter what kind of system you build, if there is any openness for<br/>
people, whatsoever, it will be vulnerable to abuse by people inclined to<br/>
conduct such abuse. There is no way to prevent that abuse. You can try to<br/>
delete the abuse, after it has occurred. You can implement moderation with<br/>
the incumbent delays, and other problems, which are necessary or<br/>
unnecessary consequences of moderation.  You can complain to the ISP's who<br/>
sold accounts to the abusers. Etc. These things are all activities<br/>
performed after the fact. Even the moderation staff still has to deal with<br/>
the abuse, if the entire list doesn't.<br/>
<br/>
When someone is trying to annoy you, the correct response is not to be<br/>
annoyed, but to remain calm. Like terrorism, there is no solution to<br/>
spam.  Whatever you do, beyond punishing those directly responsible, will <br/>
only make the matter worse.<br/>
