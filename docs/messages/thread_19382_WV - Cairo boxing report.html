                    <div class="plaintext-content">We needed to go to Parkersburg, WV yesterday and took advantage of the<br/>
opportunity to look for some letterboxes near there. We looked for<br/>
the series of 4 boxes in Cairo planted by Sir Baltazar and<br/>
Jugglermouse (who I believe are from California!) Cairo is a really<br/>
cool historic little town about 30 miles east of Parkersburg.<br/>
<br/>
Box #1 is supposed to be inside a really cool old time hardware store.<br/>
Unfortunately, we got there about 5 minutes before closing and the<br/>
very helpful old proprietor wouldn't leave us alone long enough to<br/>
look for it. It's a great old store though - worth the trip just to<br/>
see it. We'll go back another time when we have more time.<br/>
<br/>
Box #2 is hidden UNDER what is supposed to be a really great store<br/>
featuring WV made crafts and art. It was closed too (sigh.) But we<br/>
DID get the box! Nice stamp and in good shape. Felt a little like<br/>
being in a Mission Impossible episode trying to get stamped in and<br/>
rehidden before being challenged as to what we doing under there.<br/>
Success feels good though!<br/>
<br/>
Box #3 was hidden in a rather exposed position right across the street<br/>
from several houses. We sadly came to the conclusion that it may be<br/>
missing.  At least we couldn't find it where we were pretty sure it<br/>
was supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
Box #4 was one of those wonderful adventures that leaves you full of<br/>
questions about lots of things. The rather vague clues lead us a few<br/>
miles out of town on a progressively narrower and rougher road out<br/>
into the remote backcountry. (Pavement to potholes to gravel to<br/>
semi-repaired washout to glorified track!) At the end of the trail<br/>
was an abandoned cemetery that looks like it hasn't been mowed in at<br/>
least a decade. I don't think I've ever seen a cemetery this large<br/>
look this abandoned. Even in very old cemeteries there are usually a<br/>
few graves with some plastic flowers or something to indicate that<br/>
someone somewhere sort of cares. Here there was nothing to indicate<br/>
anyone had been there for a long time. Very remote, very eerie. Be a<br/>
great setting for a Twilight Zone episode or something. We DID get<br/>
the stamp! A very funky Sir Baltazar creation - well worth the trip.<br/>
<br/>
On the way back, we detoured up to Marietta to find the 'Half<br/>
Marathon' box. Marietta is a wonderful historic city that is crying<br/>
to have more letterboxes planted in it. We found this one with no<br/>
trouble (logbook is full) and headed for home. All in all a pretty<br/>
good day. Just wish we had more time to check out that hardware<br/>
store! Hope you all are having fun!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I also went into the Hardware Store.  The worker<br/>
said others had been there looking around but was <br/>
kinda clueless.  He said to stop back when the <br/>
owner was around.  <br/>
<br/>
The Quilt Box was fairly well hidden and a nice find.<br/>
<br/>
The concrete block may (or may not) have been the<br/>
one across the street from those houses.  I thought <br/>
it may have been further down the trail at another <br/>
access point.<br/>
<br/>
The cemetery - was that a Confederate Soldier -<br/>
age 25 around 1864 when he died?<br/>
<br/>
I liked the Borglum statue at half marathon.<br/>
<br/>
I also managed to find the Glass Factory at<br/>
Pennsboro and the Red Fern Bridge at Buffalo<br/>
on the same trip.<br/>
<br/>
There is a School House LB about 30 yards<br/>
from Red Fern Bridge, but the clue was not <br/>
readable at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Just got back from Myrtle Beach - The Twins<br/>
letterbox in Statesville NC was my most exciting<br/>
find so far.  Go there - you'll know what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
Found 3 in Myrtle Beach (including a HH),<br/>
3 in the Wilmington area, 10 near Florence<br/>
(including a HH).  Up to F121.<br/>
