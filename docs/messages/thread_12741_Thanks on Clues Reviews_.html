                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you folks who looked at my site. Yes, most all of them are <br/>
letter substitution codes. My latest, Eye of Sauron, is in Braille. I <br/>
am trying to make some of them just a little harder, i.e. a tad more <br/>
lyrical. Still, I hate vague and misleading clues (especially when it <br/>
means I walk another mile or two and still fail to find the box.)<br/>
<br/>
The Middle Earth series is now up to 9 boxes planted. I had <br/>
originally thought of only doing 9 boxes but I just keep finding <br/>
areas to put boxes. Hope that keeps on. There were, afterall, twenty <br/>
rings in the Lord of the Rings story.<br/>
<br/>
Last night when Ash Raven and I planted the box, we found that the <br/>
owner of the establishment was so enthused about letterboxing in <br/>
general that we cut him in on the plant. We also told him not to tell <br/>
the rest of the staff about it but he could look in the box <br/>
occasionally to monitor its progress. I think this is sort of in <br/>
keeping with letterboxing's roots. I heard that you can go into pubs <br/>
near Dartmoor and ask the bartender if there were a box in there.<br/>
<br/>
Hope Amanda and Ryan eventually get back here before the boxes are <br/>
all destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
Loving this mania,<br/>
