                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fellow letterboxers, <br/>
Recently, I've been made aware of at least one person's desire that we change <br/>
the way this talk list works.  Since we have such a wonderful history of <br/>
making decisions as a group, I thought I should bring the issue to all of you <br/>
for your opinions.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the list is set up such that all replies are, by default, sent to <br/>
the entire group.  This helps encourage us to keep the conversation so that <br/>
we can all participate.  However, if you forget and try to send a personal <br/>
reply to the sender of a message without changing the SEND TO address in your <br/>
email, it could be embarrassing.  In order to send a reply only to the person <br/>
who sent the original message, you have to cut and paste their email address <br/>
into the SEND TO box, in place of the talk list address.<br/>
<br/>
The alternative is to have the default set for individual replies.  With this <br/>
option, most email servers include a REPLY TO ALL button that let's you reply <br/>
to the entire group.  (In such cases, you may want to remove the sender's <br/>
address from the SEND TO box, or else they will receive the message twice, <br/>
once from you and once from the list)  The down side of this option is that <br/>
it's so easy to just reply to the person who sent the message, when the <br/>
entire group might be interested in hearing what you've got to say (assuming <br/>
it's related to letterboxing).<br/>
<br/>
Both options have their good points and bad, and I've seen it done both ways <br/>
on other lists.  I personally have no real preference, although I'm slightly <br/>
concerned that change will create confusion.  If change serves our needs <br/>
better, though, it is justified.  What do the rest of you think?  Please feel <br/>
free to post your opinions to the list.  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I'm going to give the Egroups polling option another try by <br/>
sending out a poll to the group so we can all vote for whether we would <br/>
rather leave the default set at REPLY TO GROUP, or if we would prefer to <br/>
change it to REPLY TO SENDER.  Your input is appreciated, so please take the <br/>
time to respond to the poll.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, in advance, for your interest and participation.<br/>

I am in accord with Erik. I tried to vote this morning, but couldn't <br/>
recall my user name with e-groups, so couldn't login :-(<br/>

However, I CAN change the reply to address on my e-mail form when I <br/>
need to!<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
Following are the reasons that I prefer the "reply sender" option.<br/>
The only reason, IMO, to leave it the way as it is now is if a subscriber's<br/>
mail program does not have a "reply all" option.<br/>
I don't think it's any harder to hit "reply all" than just "reply".<br/>
<br/>
1) While I understand the concept of "reply to list" encouraging<br/>
discussion, I think in reality it will always lead to people inadvertently<br/>
replying to the list when they really want to reply to an individual.<br/>
Not only can this be embarrassing, it also makes it easier to accidentally<br/>
post a phone number or mailing address at large, which is generally<br/>
not recommended.<br/>
<br/>
2) On lists set up with "reply to sender" as default, when I have<br/>
replied to an individual when I meant to reply to the group at large, <br/>
I can always resend to the list.<br/>
The other way around, though, you can't take it back.<br/>
<br/>
3) On another list I was on, it only took one accidental post to make<br/>
me think that I could get along very well without ever replying to<br/>
anything. If anyone here has that kind of mindset, that's the REAL<br/>
conversation stifler! Obviously, I have personally overcome the<br/>
inclination to lay low, but that doesn't mean I don't make mistakes<br/>
sometimes! :-}<br/>
