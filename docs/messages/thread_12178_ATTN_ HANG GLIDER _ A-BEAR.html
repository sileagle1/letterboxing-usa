<br/>
I have laughed at everyone's mention of "shameless plugs," but now I'm going to do one of my own.  When you come to Blackfoot, let us know.  I have planted a box or two not far from there, and I'm going to be planting one near Malad tomorrow.  Just to be gracious, I will mention that A-Bear actually planted one in Blackfoot. It's easily accessible and has a cute stamp.  If you know when you'll be looking, it might be fun to get an exchange (since there's little to no chance of running into letterboxers here on my own since there still aren't any!)<br/>

That's good news Amanda!  Hope you enjoy your visit...  Perhaps you can be<br/>
persuaded to leave behind a letterbox or 10 while you're in the area?  ;-)<br/>

&gt; Hey you two!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fret not about lonely letterboxes in your area!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We're hoping to visit the Spokane/Coeur d"Alene/Metaline Falls area in<br/>
&gt; the month of May, so Hang Glider may see new stamps in his/her<br/>
&gt; letterboxes if we are able to seek them out on our road trip.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for Aryn...I have a family reunion in Blackfoot the last weekend in<br/>
&gt; July.  There is a lot going on for us during that time, but I'm really<br/>
&gt; hoping that somehow, somewhere along the way we will be able to search<br/>
&gt; for some of  your letterboxes, as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Best regards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
