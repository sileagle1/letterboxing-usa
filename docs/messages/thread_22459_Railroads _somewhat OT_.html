                    <div class="plaintext-content">Most railroads lie on easements, the property still actually owned by <br/>
the owner of the property adjacent to the tracks. The railroad <br/>
operator typically has the right to use the land in perpetuity for the <br/>
railroad. So you typically would not have any right to be near a <br/>
railroad.<br/>
<br/>
Congress passed a rails to trails act which actually allows the <br/>
government to take over abandoned railroad easements for hiking trails <br/>
without having to condemn the property or otherwise compensate the <br/>
property owner (i.e., the property owner still owns the land but <br/>
instead of having a rr easement across the property, now has a trail <br/>
easement). <br/>

&gt; isn't all the land on either side of the tracks considered railroad<br/>
