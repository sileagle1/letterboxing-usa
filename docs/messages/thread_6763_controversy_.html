<br/>
I had an amazing day.  It was beautiful outside so I went off to plant another box.  And lucky me, I met two people coming from another one of my boxes and had my very first exchange!  It totally made my day.  Had a lovely chat with The Turtle and Psychomommy.  Exchanged stamps, talked about letterboxing.. it was perfect!<br/>
<br/>
Then I went and hid a new box (clues to follow.)  <br/>
<br/>
Then I get home and as someone said before "all hell had broken loose".   <br/>
<br/>
For the record, I really don't care what topics people choose to discuss here.  In my mind, it's all for fun.  I don't need to get picky and fussy about it all.  This is my hobby - what I do to relax.  Tell me what you had for dinner, wear purple socks, you're the first one to find a box?  HOORAY FOR YOU!  I enjoy reading what everyone has to say!  But that's just me!<br/>
<br/>
I HAD MY FIRST EXCHANGE TODAY!  HOORAY FOR ME!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I'm done.  Hopefully we can all move past this soon!<br/>
<br/>
On other subjects..<br/>
Stamping...  I still really like Speedball Speedy Stamp (pink stuff).  I agree that the white stuff made by Speedball is way too crumbly.  I almost cried when the antenna broke off of my first Firefly stamp!  I definitely want to try some of the other media people have been talking about. Thank you so much for all the input to my original post.  It has been oh-so helpful!   I no longer feel the need to find that plumber's stuff - burly Home Depot guys or not!  No one has had anything terribly positive to say about it.<br/>
<br/>
So here's a question...<br/>
Does anyone else go through separation anxiety when placing a new box?  I am so proud of myself that I can manage to carve a fairly decent stamp, I feel a certain amount of remorse when I put a new stamp in a box and send it on it's way!  I am terribly proud of the stamp I hid today.  I was so pleased with the way it turned out.  (I promise, clues are on the way!)  I almost hated to give it away!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who have actually made it to the end of this long rambling email!<br/>

  Congratulations Coleen!  Firsts of anything are always exciting, <br/>
don't you think? <br/>
<br/>
&gt; ...the white stuff made by Speedball is way too crumbly.<br/>
<br/>
     All I have been using is the white stuff  by Speedball.  Perhaps <br/>
I should explore more alternatives as you intend.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;... Does anyone else go through separation anxiety when placing a <br/>
new box?  <br/>
<br/>
     I planted my first box in January and had that same feeling.  It <br/>
was worse when I planted a box dedicated to our parents and I planted <br/>
it 2 hours away from home on top of a mountain. I know I will <br/>
probably never get back to it with all the other hikes and <br/>
letterboxes there are to discover.  Leaving my email address in the <br/>
notebook is reassuring for me.  Hopefully, with each of my boxes, <br/>
someone will contact me with an update now and then reminding me of <br/>
the care I had put into the stamp and the fun of the hike and the <br/>
planting.<br/>
     Letterboxing is certainly an escape for me as well.  <br/>
Unfortunately, I haven't had much time for it this past month in <br/>
spite of the beautiful weather we've been having. I too am feeling a <br/>
bit stressed out and my prescription for relief will be a good long <br/>
letterboxing hike.  <br/>

<br/>
Separation anxiety?  Oh yes...  when we placed our first box there <br/>
was such an excitement putting it together and stalking the hiding <br/>
spot, and then when it came time to leave it there and I felt like a <br/>
mother who primps her child and anxiously awaits the first day of <br/>
kindergarten and then totally wigs out when the time arrives to leave <br/>
him there!  The two after that were not quite as bad, but still a <br/>
little knot in the stomach as I walked away, looking over my shoulder <br/>
half expecting the thing to jump out of it's hiding spot and follow <br/>
me home!<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I placed my first box containing a stamp I carved.  That <br/>
was even worse!  I was quite proud of that stamp, making me anxious <br/>
to get the box into circulation, but also wanting to just hold onto <br/>
it and admire it at whim.  Knowing that the box may be vandalized or <br/>
disappear without a trace and I may never see it again was tugging at <br/>
me the entire time.  Hopefully that will not be the case and it will <br/>
live a long life and be enjoyed by many!<br/>
<br/>
In the meanwhile, I will just keep honing the carving blade and <br/>
cutting up erasers!<br/>
