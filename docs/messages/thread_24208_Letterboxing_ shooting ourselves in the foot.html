                    <div class="plaintext-content">What do the LBNA webmasters recommend we do when coming across letterboxes that require the finder to 'ignore the no trepassing signs'? <br/>
<br/>
I foresee 2 types of no trespassing issues: <br/>
<br/>
1. the clues actually say that the seeker must ignore the sign in order to retrieve the box.<br/>
<br/>
In this case the seeker can choose to not look for this box, but there will be those who can't resist and *will* ignore the sign. This will risk land managers getting upset when they find the box, see tell-tale signs of visits and/or discover a letterboxer trespassing. <br/>
<br/>
2. the seeker gets to the box location and there are 'no trespassing' signs that prohibit a seeker to continue the search. <br/>
<br/>
This wastes the time and money (gas is not cheap) of the seeker. The seeker got this far and might risk arrest to get the box anyway. They contact the owner but the owner doesn't respond or chooses to leave the box there anyway. They log a find on the site so the next seeker will assume that they box is likely there and all is well - having no idea that the box requires breaking the law. <br/>
<br/>
What course of action is recommended by LBNA in these scenarios?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
As a long time boxer and one who works for an organization that does not<br/>
allow letterboxing or geocaching on its property, I have to speak my peace<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I may not like my organization's rule, but I honor it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you knowingly put a box or seek a box on property where the property<br/>
owner actively and clearly states their rules or desires by posting the<br/>
property (as "no trespassing" or "no letterboxing" as in my organization),<br/>
then that is WRONG...just plain wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I manage two wildlife refuges and I spend a huge part of my time trying to<br/>
catch, inform and otherwise exclude another type of trespasser on the<br/>
property.namely those illegally riding ATV's and dirt bikes on this private<br/>
property. They ignore the 'no vehicle' signs and the posted rules. Many of<br/>
them will tear down the signs, create new trails around gates and other<br/>
blockades and their vehicles create a huge amount of damage to the<br/>
landscape. Heck, we've even had them chainsaw right through gates to get<br/>
in.just to ride their ATV. Is riding your ATV that important? Really? There<br/>
is the attitude of "Ha, Ha! what are you going to do about it?" This brazen<br/>
attitude and inequity infuriates me to distraction, and it horrifies me to<br/>
think that any letterboxer would adopt that attitude.just to find a box with<br/>
a stamp in it. Forget inconvenience, or gas prices or frustration..it's a<br/>
box with a stamp in it. We all love the hobby, but is it at the expense of<br/>
other people's rights? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Often this talk list flip flops about whether we should just do whatever we<br/>
want to do in this hobby or whether we should act as a cohesive community.<br/>
This is one of those things that does affect the reputation of the whole<br/>
community whether we like it or not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think priorities get really misplaced in this hobby. We are all<br/>
excited by the thrill of the hunt or the artwork of the stamp or whatever it<br/>
is that sparks your love of letterboxing.but it is important to remember its<br/>
scale in the world at large. It is NOT the end of the world if you cannot<br/>
get a box. Please respect the rights of landowners.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Respectfully, <br/>
<br/>

My point, though, was that LBNA should not have the responsiblity to police<br/>
these things.  It is not their job to determine if a clue is "ok" or not.<br/>

We surely should each be responsible.<br/>

feel that, possibly if only for the sake of legal liability, it's not a bad<br/>
idea to remove the clues to any box where the landowner directly contacts<br/>
the LbNA folks to notify them that the box does not have permission to be<br/>
there.  Up to that point, LbNA can state that they had no idea the box was<br/>
placed illegally.  Once notified, they can no longer say that.  They can<br/>
only decide to remove the clues.  And, in my opinion, it's ethically<br/>
incumbent upon them to do so.  That's one of the reasons some folks see fit<br/>
to *not* place their clues on such easily found sites as LbNA and atlasquest<br/>
because LbNA and atlasquest have become sooo blatantly public public public.<br/>

I don't think it's anyone's business to remove a box that takes the clues<br/>
onto "no trespassing" property.<br/>
<br/>
What about urban boxes that are in parking lots, or other privately held<br/>
property?  What about federal parks that forbid letterboxing yet so many are<br/>
there?<br/>
<br/>
Should LBNA be the police to decide which boxes are and are not allowed?  No<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously if you print a clue out and it says ignore the signs, then you<br/>
make that choice to go to the location or not.<br/>
<br/>
It is the choice of the planter and the seeker to ignore or support these<br/>
boxes.<br/>

Letterboxing is misunderstood enough as it is - it is extremely important<br/>
that all of us act responsibly and ethically in our activities.  If we are<br/>
caught doing something illegal (placing boxes on private property without<br/>
permission) it reflects not only on the planter who violated the law or trod<br/>
on the rights of someone else, it reflects on all of us and makes it more<br/>
difficult for us to portray ourselves as being responsible concerned users<br/>
of the outdoors and to avoid undue restrictions that self-policing might<br/>
help us avoid.<br/>

Thanks Jan, I could not remember what box it was, and you reminded me.<br/>
<br/>
To the Drew Clan, nothing hacks me off more then posting about something <br/>
without actually posting about something.  If you are going to openly <br/>
talk about something, then how about giving everyone all of the <br/>
information, like the name of the box, "Camp Conrad Weiser."  Further, <br/>
maybe you could add some of the text that was on the clue, or at least <br/>
the remainder of the line, "Start out by breaking the law and crossing <br/>
the chain and "No Trespassing" sign between the two large stone entrance <br/>
thingys. The counselors said it's ok."  Or how about a link to the clue <br/>
so as to enlighten everyone else as to what you are talking about:<br/>
<br/>
http://tinyurl.com/25brrc<br/>
<br/>
After all, if you are going to besmirch someone, the least you can do is <br/>
give all of the information.<br/>
<br/>
Jan is right, the clue was written tongue in cheek, because he HAD <br/>
gotten permission to plant this box on private land.  The only real <br/>
problem is that he has since fallen out of letterboxing and the land <br/>
came under new ownership.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don't think it was a good plant, and told him so in a <br/>
follow up to the find.<br/>
<br/>
Now as to the question of letterboxing.org regulating where boxes should <br/>
and should not go, as some suggest, what difference does it make?  Sure, <br/>
they can regulate what gets posted to their site, and that is their <br/>
right, because it is their site, but there is no way to stop people from <br/>
creating such boxes and posting them on their own.  It is up to the <br/>
finder to decide if they should or should not go searching for these <br/>
boxes.  Does this mean that I think it is OK to plant boxes on posted <br/>
private land, no, but is there really a way to stop it, no.<br/>
<br/>
Best you can do is discourage it by not hunting for such boxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Janila for providing this information.  It does appear that <br/>
at the time the box was planted, the placer had received permission <br/>
from somebody there, which as pointed out by several people makes a <br/>
big difference as for their intent.<br/>
<br/>
This situation does show though the importance of keeping current <br/>
with your letterboxes and not abandoning them when you lose <br/>
interest.  I am glad also that it did spark a conversation about <br/>
boxes on private property and the responsibility of both planters <br/>
and seekers in this regard.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I would agree with others who have said even though <br/>
permission had been given, the location seemed like a bad idea.  As <br/>
an employee of a children's camp, I cannot imagine the director of a <br/>
camp organization giving the okay for an activity like letterboxing, <br/>
which would in essence permit unchecked access to the premises at <br/>
any time of day or night or at any point during the year.  <br/>
Regulations about knowing who is on the property at all times, <br/>
particularly during camp sessions, are very strict and although many <br/>
camps do allow visitors to walk the property during non-program <br/>
periods, it is generally only with permission and check-in.<br/>
<br/>
It's interesting to me because the director of our camp is himself a <br/>
letterboxer and we have talked about how we could plant a camp-<br/>
themed letterbox, but not allow unrestricted access and just haven't <br/>
been able to come up with anything workable that would meet the <br/>
restrictions we work within.<br/>

I took the original post that way too - not so much meant to talk badly<br/>
about a boxer or a box (heck, I'll bet only a few readers have any idea what<br/>
box that one is!), but to demonstrate the response that comes from a<br/>
non-boxer who finds a box somewhere they feel it doesn't belong.<br/>
<br/>
I thought several good thoughts and points were made in the course of<br/>
discussing on general terms how a box planted on private property can be<br/>
impacted by elements we don't normally deal with when we plant on public<br/>
property.  I'm really glad Jay brought it up because it made me stop and<br/>
think about a couple of boxes I have on private property (WITH permission),<br/>
and wonder if I should do a better job of communicating with property owners<br/>
to make sure things haven't changed along the way.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also glad we got a chance to discuss what the webmasters', finder's, and<br/>
planter's responsibilities are when a box is listed and/or planted in an<br/>
area that might be considered off-limits.<br/>

electrical boxes, water, dangerous terrain, a bull. (You think I'm <br/>
kidding. I have a few stories about that particular animal). <br/>
<br/>
I'd never remove the box because I wouldn't print the directions to <br/>
go look for it. As for private parking lots, federal parks, etc. why <br/>
do boxers want to place boxes where they absolutely aren't wanted! I <br/>
own property in another state. There are liability issues. I'd hate <br/>
to have a box planted on that property without my knowing it, having <br/>
someone get hurt, and I didn't even know people were traipsing all <br/>
over it. It's great lake property by the way. I want to sell it. Too <br/>
much of a pain. Anyone interested? JUST KIDDING HERE. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, exactly. I agree.<br/>
<br/>
As I said before, placers and finders need to act responsibly if we care about our hobby. <br/>
<br/>
I apologize if folks felt I was being harsh, but the over-arching point I was getting at is that it doesn't matter what the real intention of the placer or finder is...or whether there was more to the story than meets the eye or not...or whether the placer originally had permission or not. The point is that people outside the hobby perceive our behavior as letterboxers in a certain way. It reflects on all of us...because whether we like it or not, we are not perceived by the outside world as individual seekers and placers, but as a group.<br/>
<br/>
And when a landowner contacts the webmasters with a concern like that, it is very clear that they perceive us as a cohesive self-policing group. Mistaken or not, it is their perception. It is disturbing to me that these people's first experience with letterboxing is one that is perceived as negative, disrespectful and supportive of trespassing or any other illegal activity. (WE know it's not true, but what good is that if others perceive us that way?).<br/>
<br/>
You can have all the glowing praise and support for the hobby in the world, but it only takes one or two unhappy complaints to muddy the name of letterboxing for all. Ask a retail store or a restaurant, people who have bad experiences, are much more likely to tell others about them than folks who have good experiences. <br/>
<br/>
I used ATVs as a comparison, because if we don't want to find ourselves in the same position as ATV people, where a few bad apples have totally and irreversibly spoiled the whole bunch (where I live and work), we need to police ourselves as individuals, and anticipate the range of consequences for what we do and work to solve problems before they are problems.<br/>
<br/>
Those who publish their clues and those who do not are all included in this, too. Just because your clues are not posted, does not mean you are immune from damaging the hobby if your box is discovered by someone who gets mad because it wasn't placed with permission or because they are offended by its content or because they think it's in a dangerous place or whatever the reason.<br/>
<br/>
I have a phrase that I use with the kids I teach all the time..."You get to decide how you behave, but other people get to decide how they feel about it."<br/>
<br/>
It is not my intention to spin people up into a fury, but instead to encourage everyone to be mindful of what you are doing. I work with the public every day and do marketing for my organization and its programs and I learned long ago that public perception is a tenuous and delicate thing...sometimes swayed by a single word. It sounds terrible to say, but if you anticipate the ignorance and/or stupidity, you can often head off problems. So...If we anticipate the negative ways non-boxers might perceive us or misunderstand us, we can go a long way to preventing negative interactions. As EllBee says, it is a cautionary tale.<br/>
<br/>
Ask yourself, how could this be interpreted? It may sound ridiculous or exhausting or you may think "too bad if someone doesn't like it" or "it's not my fault if they misinterpret what I'm doing", but as I said, it really does matter to our hobby as a whole, because what WE think or what WE intend is not what defines us, but how others react to it that will determine our reputation.<br/>
<br/>
We get to decide how we behave, but others will decide how they feel about it...and ultimately what our reputation will be. <br/>
<br/>
We can have influence over it, but will not ever have control over it. I care about what people think about this hobby. I don't ever want to be in a position where we have no place to go letterboxing...like ATV enthusiasts. Letterboxing is a good hobby, and I want those who find out about it to think so too. That will only come if we adopt a mindful, ambassadorial attitude. We don't have to shout the existence of our hobby to the world. We just have to anticipate what our interactions might be and work to make sure they are positive ones. <br/>
<br/>
Again, Respectfully, <br/>

&gt; &gt; Thanks Jan, I could not remember what box it was, and you reminded me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; To the Drew Clan, nothing hacks me off more then posting about something<br/>
&gt; &gt; without actually posting about something. If you are going to openly<br/>
&gt; &gt; talk about something, then how about giving everyone all of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; information, like the name of the box, "Camp Conrad Weiser." Further,<br/>
&gt; &gt; maybe you could add some of the text that was on the clue, or at least<br/>
&gt; &gt; the remainder of the line, "Start out by breaking the law and crossing<br/>
&gt; &gt; the chain and "No Trespassing" sign between the two large stone entrance<br/>
&gt; &gt; thingys. The counselors said it's ok." Or how about a link to the clue<br/>
&gt; &gt; so as to enlighten everyone else as to what you are talking about:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; http://tinyurl.com/25brrc <http: 25brrc="" tinyurl.com=""><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; After all, if you are going to besmirch someone, the least you can do is<br/>
&gt; &gt; give all of the information.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Jan is right, the clue was written tongue in cheek, because he HAD<br/>
&gt; &gt; gotten permission to plant this box on private land. The only real<br/>
&gt; &gt; problem is that he has since fallen out of letterboxing and the land<br/>
&gt; &gt; came under new ownership.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Personally, I don't think it was a good plant, and told him so in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; follow up to the find.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now as to the question of letterboxing.org regulating where boxes should<br/>
&gt; &gt; and should not go, as some suggest, what difference does it make? Sure,<br/>
&gt; &gt; they can regulate what gets posted to their site, and that is their<br/>
&gt; &gt; right, because it is their site, but there is no way to stop people from<br/>
&gt; &gt; creating such boxes and posting them on their own. It is up to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; finder to decide if they should or should not go searching for these<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes. Does this mean that I think it is OK to plant boxes on posted<br/>
&gt; &gt; private land, no, but is there really a way to stop it, no.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Best you can do is discourage it by not hunting for such boxes.<br/>

Somehow the landowners found out about the clues on the website.<br/>
Probably by reading the box info... but perhaps not. After all, many<br/>
boxes I have found don't point to either website; the placers assume<br/>
you know about them already. If the box owner did not put their own<br/>
contact info in the box [as most boxes I've found do], would they put<br/>
the website info? Maybe, maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
So the new owners bother to click around, find the website, figure out<br/>
how to contact the owner [I am sure it's not hard, but in all the time<br/>
I have spent on the sites, I have never bothered to look for that<br/>
info; it does take some effort]. Did they not bother to go and read<br/>
the clue itself? Did they not bother to go and MAKE SURE the clue was<br/>
in fact actually posted there, before they demanded it be taken down?<br/>
<br/>
Of course they did, they directly quote the clue.<br/>
<br/>
Which specifically says the placer got permission and that it was "ok."<br/>

Seriously. While they have the right to demand boxes be removed from<br/>

whit of what their opinion of you was if you trespassed on the property and<br/>
a nice friendly non-dramatic black &amp; white car calmly came along and gave<br/>
you a free ride to a jail cell for a few hours.  :-) Now *that* might be<br/>
dramatic.<br/>
<br/>
1.  The placer had permission from the previous owner to place the box.<br/>
2.  The new owners not only did not give permission for the box, but they<br/>
left the no tresspassing sign in place.<br/>
3.  The new owners emailed the webmasters requesting the clues be removed<br/>
from the site.<br/>
4.  Quite possibly the for-profit business is such that the new owners<br/>
really don't need or want the "good will" of letterboxers compared to the<br/>
potential liability risk they run of not being in control of exactly who is<br/>
on their property at what time.<br/>
<br/>
I go on retreat frequently to a convent in IL that's at a beautiful bend in<br/>
a river.  If I were to plant a letterbox close to the river, it could be<br/>
reached via canoe or kayak without the finder having to actually trespass on<br/>
convent property.  When I asked the order that owns the convent about it,<br/>
they said they'd have no problems with it per se as long as I did it<br/>
word-of-mouth and thus controlled who came looking for the box, since they<br/>
have no security guards on the convent grounds and wouldn't want people<br/>
coming via land instead of sea to search for the box and thus possibly put<br/>
nuns and retreatants at potential risk.  The order needs to know that<br/>
whoever is actually walking around on their grounds, which are extensive<br/>
beautifully wooded grounds, is either a nun, a retreatant, or an employee,<br/>
and nobody else.  The property owners who emailed the LbNA webmasters might<br/>
be in a similar position of needing to be able to control who's on the<br/>
property so that nobody gets hurt and nobody gets sued.  Do the nuns need<br/>
"customer service training"?  Nooooooooo.  Their convent is doing just fine<br/>
business-wise.  God and the Pope gave 'em all the customer service training<br/>
they need.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
The simple black &amp; white of it (no pun intended)is that, since the land in<br/>
the box clues has new owners, it *is* indeed tresspassing to letterbox on<br/>
that property, especially since the property *is* posted.  And the last I<br/>
heard, traspassing is illegal and can get a person charged with at least a<br/>
misdemeanor.  I know, on my place in northwest WI, I have my property<br/>
posted -- and it's posted every few feet for 120 acres along the road.  That<br/>
means no hunters, that means no trappers, that means no humans other than me<br/>
or my friends picking my asparagus, picking my morels, picking my<br/>
blueberries, gooseberries, or hazelnuts, that means no strange families<br/>
sneaking up to my barns or pastures to get a look at "the pretty horses" or<br/>
"the cool alpacas", that means no humans other than me planting a letterbox.<br/>
And my no trespassing signs are another reason my clues up there are<br/>
word-of-mouth to folks I give permission to be on the property to find the<br/>
letterbox.  People who come down the river via boat, waders, etc., have<br/>
every right to be there.  People who come by land to tromp over hill &amp; dale<br/>
thru my property have no legitimate right to be there.  Last I saw, I was<br/>
the only one paying the property taxes for the past 30+ years.<br/>
<br/>
It's truly unfortunate that the land probably changed hands without the box<br/>
placer knowing, but it did happen, and as the people paid for that land so<br/>
it's *their* land, and as they're using the land as a commercial enterprise<br/>
and thus have to worry about liability problems, security problems, safety<br/>
problems, asking a webmaster to take down clues ain't melodramatic.  Since,<br/>
now that it's their land, it *is* trespassing.  They might not be concerned<br/>
with having your "respect."  They might just be more concerned with keeping<br/>
the property *they* paid for as they want to keep it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe as someone who owns property that often attracts trespassers who don't<br/>
believe they need a little thing called "permission", I can identify with<br/>
people who don't care much for trespassers. :-)<br/>

<br/>
*********************************<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine any number of places that might have an enormous amount of<br/>
goodwill, but can't afford loose practices for the safety of their clients.<br/>
Case in point:<br/>
<br/>
I'm heavily involved in Cub Scouts and we are fortunate to have a scout<br/>
reservation in our council.  It's a wonderful facility and I spend as much<br/>
time as I possibly can there.  We are soon going to have a district campout<br/>
for cub scouts and the event coordinator, in a nod to me (more like a cheap<br/>
attempt to make sure she gets lots of my time on this event - lol), has<br/>
taken the letterboxing idea and applied it to things we teach scouts like<br/>
LNT and map and compass and land navigation.  The event is called "Stamping<br/>
Thru the Woods".  It has fallen to me to carve 140 personal stamps, create<br/>
15 boxes, and make another 7-10 station boxes.  I will be going soon to<br/>
plant the boxes at the reservation and I went ahead and talked to the powers<br/>
that be so they have a firm understanding of what I'm doing.  I took a box<br/>
to them and explained the activity and they had two questions that really<br/>
stand out in light of this discussion: 1) will I be leaving the boxes in<br/>
place?  As it happens, I won't, but they would've been cool with it as long<br/>
as I only gave scouts the clues and there was no way anyone not in scouting<br/>
(i.e. not either a scout or a thoroughly background-checked scouter) would<br/>
know about the boxes.  and 2) when I asked permission to bring<br/>
letterboxers into camp to help me plant, I was told they had to have<br/>
background checks first.<br/>
<br/>
They were enthusiastic about what we are doing, but they were equally<br/>
adamant that no unauthorized person would be in camp as a result of our<br/>
boxes.  They simply can't afford the risk that someone would venture into<br/>
camp to look for the boxes and inadvertantly put a child at risk, or worse,<br/>
enter camp on the premise of looking for boxes and deliberately harm a<br/>
kiddo.  There are too many weird things happening in this day and age,<br/>
especially to kids, and places that cater to kids (or heck, anyone who is<br/>
seeking some respite, whether paid or unpaid, in a facility designed for<br/>
that purpose) just can't take a chance.  They need to know every person who<br/>
is in camp, and if they don't know them, they need to know that there is no<br/>
possible other reason they would be there so they can run them out.  I<br/>
understand their feelings and I completely respect that - my son is, after<br/>
all, one of the boys who will be at that camp many, many more times in the<br/>
next seven years, and I like knowing they take his safety that seriously.<br/>
<br/>
There really ARE bigger things than letterboxing and the property owner may<br/>
well have only been exercising their own diligence as they protect others.<br/>
Who can fault that - really?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You say the following:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<i am="" concerned="" just="" more="" the<br="" with="">
good opinions of those I respect. And while letterboxing is simply a<br/>

But from what I am seeing, the landowners could have simply said<br/>
"There are clues to a box on your website, please take them down.<br/>
We've removed the box." &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;.what a bunch of drama queens these people are.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I am hearing is that you think that the landowners should have been<br/>
nicer about their reaction.that their reaction was 'over the top', perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that a landowner who finds something on their property they<br/>
didn't give permission for should just 'grin and bear it'? What if you were<br/>
to find someone else's laundry on your front stoop? Or what if you found<br/>
someone storing their belongings in your shed? Would you be inclined to be<br/>
nice about it? I'd be really annoyed and really wouldn't care why they were<br/>
doing it or if they thought it was harmless. It's the same for a landowner<br/>
with letterboxing. To me it would be the exception rather than the rule that<br/>
a landowner that discovers a letterbox (not knowing what it is previously)<br/>
would be pleased or excited about it. I'd think, 'who the heck does this<br/>
person think they are putting this here?'.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it is very unfair to call them drama queens. After all, it is their<br/>
land. Folks have been commenting about this particular incident saying that<br/>
we shouldn't have made judgments because we didn't know the whole story.<br/>
Turn the tables for a moment.do any of us always know why a parcel of land<br/>
is posted as "no trespassing"? Perhaps we don't know the whole story.<br/>
Perhaps the land is contaminated. Perhaps there is a dangerous animal.or<br/>
what have you. A landowner would be perfectly in their rights to react<br/>
strongly to trespassing. We live in a highly litigious society. They are<br/>
worried about all types of liability.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You also say:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<instead message="" overly<br="" seems="" sent="" the="" they="">
melodramatic as quoted. Not to mention deliberately spinning the truth<br/>
of the matter to make the letterboxer look like some kind of<br/>
inconsiderate boob, which is contrary to the actual clues as posted.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is my entire point. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The reaction of non-boxers is out of our control. You're bothered (others<br/>
too) that a letterboxer was put in a negative light."an inconsiderate boob"<br/>
if you will. There is no "spin" here at all. It is a person's genuine<br/>
reaction.a negative one, but theirs in their own right. It doesn't matter<br/>
what the clues said. (How many of us don't always read clues properly or in<br/>
their entirety?) It doesn't matter what the placer's intent was ('the road<br/>
to hell is paved with good intentions'). What will have a lasting impact is<br/>
that these landowners now have a bad taste in their mouth about this hobby<br/>
and will probably tell others about it. Our indignation about this is right<br/>
here, right now. We'll all get over it, but now a whole new set of people at<br/>
this place don't like letterboxing and won't ever take the time to learn<br/>
otherwise. That's the problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My playing devil's advocate here is an encouragement to look at these<br/>
situations from everyone's point of view, not just letterboxers. <br/>
<br/>
They cannot be expected to just accept unapproved objects on their property<br/>
with glee. Just look how reactionary and easily inflamed this talk list is.<br/>
Why do we expect the rest of the world to be any less reactionary or more<br/>
tolerant.or more delicate or articulate in their expression of their dismay<br/>
for that matter? This is why we must be pro-active and careful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening. I appreciate that this thread has remained civil as<br/>
this discussion has unfolded.<br/>

<br/>
I actually have a somewhat opposite opinion, but it might not be based<br/>
on actual facts, only on what I can tell from the info I have thus far<br/>
-- which as we've just seen, might be incomplete.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow the landowners found out about the clues on the website.<br/>
Probably by reading the box info... but perhaps not. After all, many<br/>
boxes I have found don't point to either website; the placers assume<br/>
you know about them already. If the box owner did not put their own<br/>
contact info in the box [as most boxes I've found do], would they put<br/>
the website info? Maybe, maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
So the new owners bother to click around, find the website, figure out<br/>
how to contact the owner [I am sure it's not hard, but in all the time<br/>
I have spent on the sites, I have never bothered to look for that<br/>
info; it does take some effort]. Did they not bother to go and read<br/>
the clue itself? Did they not bother to go and MAKE SURE the clue was<br/>
in fact actually posted there, before they demanded it be taken down?<br/>
<br/>
Of course they did, they directly quote the clue.<br/>
<br/>
Which specifically says the placer got permission and that it was "ok."<br/>
<br/>
But their email makes it sound like they just discovered this box, and<br/>
are angry that the placer is inciting people to "break the law."<br/>
<br/>
RustyPuff is concerned with how letterboxers are perceived by these<br/>
people, and that is a good point. My own opinion is, what a bunch of<br/>
drama queens these people are, and thus I care not one whit for their<br/>
opinion of ME. It's not that I don't care what people think of me; I<br/>
try to be considerate and all that. I am just more concerned with the<br/>
good opinions of those I respect. And while letterboxing is simply a<br/>
hobby for me, they are running a paying business. Perhaps they need to<br/>
take some customer service training and learn how to not alienate<br/>

"There are clues to a box on your website, please take them down.<br/>
We've removed the box." Instead the message they sent seems overly<br/>
melodramatic as quoted. Not to mention deliberately spinning the truth<br/>
of the matter to make the letterboxer look like some kind of<br/>
inconsiderate boob, which is contrary to the actual clues as posted.<br/>

&gt; And when a landowner contacts the webmasters with a concern like that, it<br/>

&gt; Mistaken or not, it is their perception. It is disturbing to me that these<br/>
&gt; people's first experience with letterboxing is one that is perceived as<br/>
&gt; negative, disrespectful and supportive of trespassing or any other illegal<br/>
&gt; activity. (WE know it's not true, but what good is that if others perceive<br/>
&gt; us that way?).<br/>

obligated to worry about how letterboxers feel about being told not to<br/>
trespass when they have to weigh that against the safety of their campers<br/>
and the use of their grounds by the campers.<br/>
<br/>
I was using the convent example to point out that controlling who's around<br/>
the area can be difficult with large, wooded expanses of land, and the<br/>
landowners have a right to make it as clear as they need to make it that<br/>
they don't want trespassers, for the sake of safety and the sake of<br/>
liability, and because *they* own that property so they get to determine<br/>
who's going to use it and for what.  For profit or not for profit doesn't<br/>
really make a difference.  It could be a for profit family campground, it<br/>
could be a not for profit girl scout camp.  There's really no difference.<br/>

Oh sorry, it was not clear that this email came from a convent -- it<br/>
appeared to be from a for-profit campground. My error.<br/>
<br/>
--F.Mystic<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  and nobody else. The property owners who emailed the LbNA webmasters<br/>
might<br/>
&gt;  be in a similar position of needing to be able to control who's on the<br/>
&gt;  property so that nobody gets hurt and nobody gets sued. Do the nuns need<br/>
&gt;  "customer service training"? Nooooooooo. Their convent is doing just fine<br/>
&gt;  business-wise. God and the Pope gave 'em all the customer service<br/>
training<br/>
&gt;  they need. :-)"<br/>
