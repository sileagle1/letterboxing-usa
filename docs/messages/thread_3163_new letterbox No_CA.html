                    <div class="plaintext-content">On August 26th, Funhog placed a new letterbox in Folsom, Sacramento<br/>
County, California.<br/>
There are several State Parks sites in the area, a couple of<br/>
campgrounds, paddling, swimming , birdwatching and now letterboxing for<br/>
entertainment. The little Gold Rush vintage town of Folsom is well worth<br/>
a look. If you cruise Sutter Street stop in and say "hi" to my friends<br/>
at Rainbow Bridge Jewelers.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead:<br/>
The entrance to Folsom Powerhouse Park is between the Rainbow Bridge and<br/>
Scott Street on Greenback Lane. The letterbox is five minutes from the<br/>
gate.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
Enter the Park (open 6 AM-9 PM when I was there) through the chain link<br/>
gate. Go to the first Eucalyptus tree on your right. Take the trail<br/>
behind this tree down towards the river. At the end of the rail fence<br/>
take the trail at 70 degrees (magnetic.) Once you go down four wooden<br/>
steps go right on a small trail. You will pass a sawn off tree stump on<br/>
your right and climb up a small rise. Go to the pine tree at 65 degrees.<br/>
After four more paces, turn right. The letterbox is hidden behind the<br/>
large boulder on the right. Look for some loose rocks and a protruding<br/>
stick.<br/>
Happy trails, Funhog<br/>
