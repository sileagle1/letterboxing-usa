                    <div class="plaintext-content">My brother has been telling me about Letterboxing for a couple of <br/>
years now, but I had never tried it for myself.  This weekend, he <br/>
visited Alabama from his home in Nebraska.  I asked him if we could <br/>
go out together in search of a letterbox.  We chose a box that was <br/>
located at an old mine ruin near Birmingham, but we could not find <br/>
the box.  Based on the clues, we are confident that we found the spot <br/>
where the box was placed, but it was missing.  All was not lost <br/>
though, we had a great hike in an interesting forest.  Later that <br/>
day, I set out on a search of my own without my brother and I FOUND <br/>
MY FIRST LETTERBOX.  I am now hooked.  The LBNA page shows only about <br/>
a dozen boxes in Alabama, but I would like to know if there are <br/>
others that anyone knows of.  Also, if there are any letterboxers in <br/>
the Birmingham/Alabama area I would like to hear from you.  <br/>

Congrats on your first find, and welcome to the club! There is a discussion <br/>
group for the Southeast US that's fairly new but growing, so maybe you'll <br/>
have better luck touching base with other nearby letterboxers there:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-southeast<br/>
<br/>
The regional groups are really taking off, so anyone who is looking for <br/>
discussions that are more specific to your own area should check out their <br/>
nearest group. Here's a list of them all:<br/>

Thanks for the warm welcome.  I have joined the SE group and actually <br/>
carved my first stamp this afternoon.  I will place this stamp at <br/>
Tannehill State Park near Tuscaloosa, Alabama this weekend.  <br/>
