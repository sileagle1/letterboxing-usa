<br/>
We decided to combine our two hobbies today.<br/>
<br/>
With stamp &amp; logbook in one hand, and fishing pole in the other, we <br/>
headed out and boxed for both "Hall Mill" (new) in Marlborough <br/>
and "Shoddy Mill" in Glastonbury.<br/>
<br/>
The hikes were invigorating, the sights were stimulating and the <br/>
rivers had strong running currents today.<br/>
<br/>
The days results:<br/>
# Mill ruins found: 2<br/>
# boxes found: 2<br/>
# of bites on fishing pole: 1<br/>
# fish caught: 0<br/>
<br/>
All in all another GREAT day outdoors in Connecticut!<br/>
