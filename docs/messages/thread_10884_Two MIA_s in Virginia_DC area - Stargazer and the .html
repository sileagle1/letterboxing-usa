Harrisonburg is missing.  It was apparently picked up by the folks <br/>
cleaning up the dead logs, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I am sad to report the Castle Box at the Smithsonian is <br/>
missing.  I went yesterday afternoon about 2 p.m. and it is gone.<br/>
<br/>
Leger de Maine...will you replace the next time you go sightseeing in <br/>
our fine capital?  Perhaps you can embellish the new stamp with some <br/>
of your other beautiful artwork?<br/>
