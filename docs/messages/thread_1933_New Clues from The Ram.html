<div>Clue Difficulty: Easy</div>
<div>Trail Difficulty: Moderate</div>
<div>Length: 1-2 hours, 3miles max round trip</div>
<div><br/>    Did you find Little Dam?</div>
<div>    Look not far from that if you 
can,</div>
<div>    for three treasures with views here in this 
plan.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    Begin by finding where the Narragansett 
Trail follows Ryder Road. When the trail turns into the woods, you'll find a 
spot where you can park. Start here and follow (blue blazes) the trail UP.... 
stop, remember to breathe, it's okay, it's a good warmup, you'll be fine for the 
rest of the hike.</div>
<div>    You'll reach a bit of a landing and 
continue along the trail with an only slightly obscured view of the valley 
below. Soon you will come to a large ourcrop of rock on your left where the 
trail runs in front of it. You'll have to make a decision here. You can either 
go between the rock and the tree or between the trunks. Either way, it's a bit 
of a tight squeeze (especially for an 11 year old boy scout on his first hike 
with an overloaded backpack...memories). Your first treasure will be found to 
your left over the hunk of rock under a pile of stones about 25 feet from the 
tight squeeze. </div>
<div>    Continue along the trail following the blue 
blazes and you will soon come to an obvious overlook. On a sunny day, look out 
to the horizon and you can see the ocean. Really, yes that is the ocean. Great 
spot to sun yourself, take a break, eat lunch, or re-hydrate. After that 
overlook, just up the trail perhaps 20 feet, there is another outcropping of 
rock to your left. Nestled in the front face of some overhanging rock a few feet 
off the trail is the Ocean View letterbox.</div>
<div>    After stamping in at Ocean View, continue 
along the trail as it levels out somewhat and then continues to descend into 
Yawbux Valley. It is very important to follow the blazes as you descend. There 
are other domestic trails that have been created nearby. </div>
<div>    Pass into the hemlock grove into another 
world. Shortly after entering this grove, you will come to a steep descent into 
the heart of Yawbux Valley. Continue on the trail along the brook. After you 
find yourself crossing the brook you will soon come to a tree that seems to be 
growing out of a large "outcrop" of rock on your right. Turn to this tree and 
stare it in the face. Who's winning? Anyway, look over his shoulder directly 
behind him and you'll see two other trees that cross trunks at their base. There 
you will find Yawbux Valley Beaver.</div>
<div>    But wait, don't stop there. Continue a 
little to the pond. This is an area that is inhabited and worked heavily by 
beavers. You can see their home in the pond and there is plenty of sign in the 
area. This is a beautiful spot and it is not uncommon to find other signs of 
wildlife here. </div>
<div>    To get back to your steed, basically, go 
back the way that you came. This is one of those trails that is a totally 
different hike when you do it backwards. Hope you enjoyed the 
scenery!</div>
