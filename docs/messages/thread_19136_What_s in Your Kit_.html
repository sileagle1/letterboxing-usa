This was a great question -- and now my backpack has gone from 5LB to <br/>
15LB!  And I don't mean LetterBoxes.<br/>
<br/>
Are the tick tweezers in the first aid kit?<br/>

And being the sweet darlin' that I am, also carry a compact umbrella <br/>

Diane and I are pleased to take along assorted sized baggies and paper towels and a spare box to help out others with maintenance (In addition to the others supplies already mentioned).  Helping others with maintenance greatly increses the longevity of the box contents - even if it's just wiping out a bit of condensation.  I'm very grateful when someone gives me an update on a box we planted further away, and tells me they replaced a baggie or something.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we should include some pruning shears, so we can also clear away poison ivy (the Flea Plant, as some Quebecois say).<br/>

Oh gosh, in the state of Maine you need an emergency rescue kit on hand - just <br/>
kidding! But seriously, here's a small checklist of things I always bring when <br/>
boxing.<br/>
<br/>
frozen nalgene water bottles - for hiking - usually about 5 or more<br/>
flashlight - pocket size and industrial<br/>
bug stuff<br/>
after bug stuff (after-bite)<br/>
maine atlas &amp; gazeteer - big road map<br/>
directions<br/>
field guides<br/>
waterproof field notebook<br/>
<br/>
oh, for actual letterboxing???<br/>
oh yeah....<br/>
<br/>
my personal stamp<br/>
traveler stamp<br/>
ten thousand colored markers<br/>
a set of sharpies<br/>
pencil<br/>
personal journal<br/>
compass<br/>
personal palm-pilot with all clues electronic (WE USE NO PAPER)<br/>
some boxes to plant myself<br/>
<br/>
I think that just about does it.<br/>
Oh and always, a change of shoes for the 2+ hour car ride that is inevitable. I can't <br/>
drive in my hefty hiking books after a long day! :-) There ya have it.<br/>

Water (which as I've said before is MY number one most important item), a flashlight, gloves, paper towels, baby wipes, extra sandwhich baggies, an empty plastic bag to throw my shoes in on the car ride home when we've tramped through a mud-soaked bridal trail, first aid kit (I'm a Red Cross volunteer, it's in my blood to have one of those), my cell phone always comes with us, I have pepper spray, too, on my key chain, so that comes by default since the keys usually are in the backpack, we've got a hanger because someone suggested it once for poking into holes, but so far we haven't needed it (we usually find a stick on the ground to use instead).  And of course, our compass, our ink pad, our stamp, pens, our index cards (we use index cards for our letterboxing journal &amp; store them in a photo album).  We keep the compass, ink pad, stamp &amp; cards in an old travel-sized Caboodles case I had as a teen, which<br/>
 gives us a nice (dry) flat surface to stamp on.  And a snack in the car so we've got nourishment waiting for us after the hike.  Although I've gotten some really great ideas reading everyone else's lists.  Maybe I need to have Deedle start carrying the backpack (which I hope to have an LbNA logo patch on in a month or two, so you'll recognize us on the trail).<br/>

<br/>
That's a better alternative than what I've seen *some* people do for <br/>
blisters.  Such as 'sewing' a small piece of thread through a <br/>
blister, then leaving it there.  (It's supposed to help draw out the <br/>
excess fluids from the blister while hiking the trail.)  One poor <br/>
person I saw had a dozen little pieces of thread perforating their <br/>
feet.  It was just plain gross.  Duct tape on blisters for thru-<br/>
hikers is quite common, however.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is a clean condom, I hope?  Has anyone actually ever claimed <br/>
that a condom full of water ever saved their life?  Because if not, <br/>
that seems like a strange suggestion for a 'survival' class.  =)<br/>

My journal<br/>
Ballpoint pens<br/>
Sharpie Marker<br/>
Baby Wipes (both for stamps and knees, or wiping of bird poop)<br/>
Empty ziplocs of 4 different sizes. (For replacing bags in boxes)<br/>
My stamp and the kids stamps<br/>
Rubber gloves<br/>
Flashlight<br/>
Compass<br/>
Peanut Butter Crackers<br/>
Personal Traveler<br/>
Fold up umbrella.<br/>
<br/>
I think the most useful thing so far has been the heavy duty rubber gloves.<br/>

before walking in or grabbing anything with my hand. Here in South <br/>
Texas rattlesnakes are all too common. I also take a small GARDEN <br/>
FORK for raking back fallen leaves or gravel (as it turned out last <br/>
week) instead of doing it with my bare hands. I have BENEDRYL SPRAY <br/>
as well, which was a good thing last week, when I took hold of a <br/>
thorny bush to pull it aside to pass into a thicket, and got too <br/>
close to some kind of wasp. I take COLORED PENCILS too, to color in <br/>
my personal stamp when I have time. Other than those items...oh, and <br/>
a WHISTLE, I think everything else is pretty standard. Only last <br/>
week, I did have two SMALL DOLLS (the Barbie variety, only the age <br/>
11 year old characters, Stacy and Janet) to photograph posing in <br/>
front of 'touristy' signs and in various stages of finding a <br/>
letterbox. This was for a photo-story site and 'vacation doll' <br/>
project. <br/>
