Moby Dick: "Once upon a time there was a whale. It was a white whale.<br/>
Captain Ahab was an unhappy man. Captain Ahab was obsessed with killing the<br/>
white whale. The end." Really now, doesn't that say it all?<br/>
<br/>
Ah oooooooooh, the way Shakespeare could be condensed. Look at the kudos<br/>
we'd get from high school English students around the country. Hamlet has<br/>
29,551 words! I'll bet we could knock that down to 10,000 or so and<br/>
everybody would still get the idea just fine.<br/>
