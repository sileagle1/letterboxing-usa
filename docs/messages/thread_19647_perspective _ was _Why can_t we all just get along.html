is called the "elitist" that we who really care about letterboxing learn. i<br/>
don't think you are a cranky old grouch. and for all of you out there..... i<br/>
don't know brian. what i do know is - it is the older letterboxers, the ones<br/>
that have been around the mountain a time or two that have made letterboxing<br/>
what it is today. what if those cranky old grouches had not cared enough to<br/>
plant those first boxes, to travel to the other states and plant the first?<br/>
what would you have to argue about then? why do we ask a question if we do<br/>
not want the answer? two dimensional conversation is difficult at best. not<br/>
always do the words come out like you intend. i for one feel honored that i<br/>
have been trusted by having access to clues, how ever i have been presented<br/>
them. for without the clues and the knowledge these grouches are giving me<br/>
how would i proceed? would i just stumble along in my own world tripping<br/>
over tupperware on the trail? doesn't the fact that we all participate in<br/>
this game, one of secrecy, make us all somewhat of an elitist? why do we<br/>
look at every post as an opportunity to tear it apart? i enjoy the questions<br/>
 i enjoy the debate or banter. what i don't enjoy is seeing the mud slinging<br/>
 mud should be enjoyed on the trails naturally. if you don't agree with me,<br/>
that is fine. if you don't agree with each other that is fine. i want to<br/>
continue to learn. i want to preserve this wonderful adventure for the<br/>
future generations. i don't care if your stamp is better or worse than mine.<br/>
i don't care if my response is going to make you angry for the day. get over<br/>
it. i am here to learn from these elitist grouchy old boxers. why are you<br/>
here?<br/>

We all can't get along because every time someone who actually cares <br/>
about the game makes a remark they are called an elitist and deemed a <br/>
cranky old grouch. Many of the older boxers read this list daily yet <br/>
seldom post anything. When they do post it is usually about something <br/>
that they care deeply about. They make their point in a direct manner <br/>
and it is usually taken as being rude or condescending to the newer <br/>
people in the group. The whole Thumpers dad attitude just doesn't <br/>
work in real life. If nobody says anything that isn't "nice" what <br/>
will that do but lead to stagnation. I've about given up on this list <br/>
because I can't even make a joke about myself without causing <br/>
controversy. Maybe people should remember that this is a talklist for <br/>
and about a game. <br/>

What did he have to do with it? ;-) Just joking mark.<br/>
But seriously, the holy grail? Well, it's still out there - those boxes are alive and well, and if <br/>
it weren't for the predecessors in this state, then i don't think anyone would trek all the <br/>
way up to the little island rock for a little plastic box.<br/>

I'd like to complain about the posts where people try to do <br/>
something against standard letterboxing conventions, then get all <br/>
upset when almost everyone else doesn't like it.<br/>
<br/>
Is it really that surprising that such actions would get everyone in <br/>
a tizzy?<br/>
<br/>
The pattern is applicable to every group of people who've ever <br/>
congregated.  Established rules and conventions--somebody tries to <br/>
break them--and everyone else is tweaked by it.  Which is fine--I <br/>
don't have a problem with that--but then to be shocked (SHOCKED!) <br/>
that it would upset everyone else?  Well, yeah....  What else did <br/>
you expect to happen?<br/>
