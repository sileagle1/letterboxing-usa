                    <div class="plaintext-content">If anyone is interested in getting medallions let me know.  I still <br/>
have some.  They are 3.35 each, shipping included.  I am taking <br/>
orders on a first come basis.  If I get more orders than medallions I <br/>
have on hand, I will place them on back order and send them when the <br/>
next bulk order comes through.  Depending on the number of replies, I <br/>
would anticipate I will order the next bulk order on March 15, 2004.  <br/>
I will let you know about the exact date through posts on the list in <br/>
the next few weeks.  This would mean you would get them towards the <br/>
end of April or so.<br/>

You can mail payments to me at:<br/>

zero between the N and K.  Also please change the "at" to @.  I <br/>
needed to do that to make sure the entire address was viewable here.  <br/>
I AM UNABLE TO ACCEPT CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS THROUGH PAYPAL.  Please <br/>
pay be echeck or from your balance.<br/>
