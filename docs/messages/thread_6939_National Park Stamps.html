I've been reading the treads about putting the boxes on National Park Lands. <br/>
  While I find it disappointing, I can understand their position.<br/>
<br/>
However, if one must have a stamp from a National Park, go to the Visitor's <br/>
Centers.  The NPS has a Passport Cancellation program where they sell <br/>
"Passports" and you take them to the various National Park Sites to have <br/>
them cancelled.  You don't have to have the passport to use the cancellation <br/>
stamps.<br/>
<br/>
While this isn't the best answer to the situation...It still gives us hikers <br/>
a reason to visit the National Parks.<br/>

Yup, &amp; there is normally a registry there for you to sign in to as <br/>
well. To my knowlege, there isn't (yet) a federal law against <br/>
stamping the registry, rather than signing it.  So, bring your <br/>
personal stamp with you, too.<br/>
