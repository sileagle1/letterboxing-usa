<br/>
I guess I think of our (Gwen and Don's) letterboxes with shorter life <br/>
spans than you do for your letterboxes. So with that in mind I'm not <br/>
expecting our letter boxes to be around for more than 3 or 4 years <br/>
after they are planted. Now many of them are still viable after 6+ <br/>
years, but that is not my expectation.<br/>
<br/>
Many folks plant a few and then go away after a few months. Those <br/>
boxes are usually left out there with out much consideration from the <br/>
planter. Sure some are adopted, but those that aren't become trash.<br/>
<br/>
It takes about $10(estimate not considering gas) or so to construct a <br/>
letterbox, and if a person were charged $.50 to register their clue <br/>
sheet on line I wouldn't expect that would force many planters to go <br/>
WOM.<br/>
Even if it did produce more WOM boxes is that really a bad thing?<br/>
<br/>
If it stopped some folks from planting, then that too might be not to <br/>
bad. Maybe the quality of letterboxes would improve?<br/>
 So rather than having a quickly made construction of a letterbox <br/>
more thought might go into it's creation, as well as more thought <br/>
into where and how it is planted.<br/>
<br/>
In any case this idea would solve several problems.<br/>

4 year tenure. A portion of those were day only plants for gatherings, a<br/>
portion are WOM, a portion are listed on personal web sites, cuckoo clues,<br/>

stopped me from doing it? I think some of them might have not been planted..<br/>
but it would have been my earlier ones, the ones that were planted because I<br/>
was so excited to plant and I was afraid someone would take my "perfect<br/>
spot" so I put it out there without the care that I now take in planting. <br/>

Hmmm.. it needs more thought but right now I'm not seeing many negatives to<br/>
