Pretty much that's it...usually someone posts to the list about an injury <br/>
sustained in the line of letterboxing, and folks post as to whether they qualify <br/>
for the purple heart. I would say that those who have been awarded the PH have <br/>
had, on the whole, rather significant mis-adventures...falling off cliffs, <br/>
breaking ankles, having to be rescued by the fire dept or go to the emergency <br/>
room...that sort of thing. My dog got awarded the purple heart for having gotten <br/>
attacked by another dog on the trail...needing many stitches and an overnight <br/>
stay at the vet's.<br/>
<br/>
Let's hope not too many people have to be awarded the PH.<br/>
<br/>
Stay Well!<br/>

That's pretty much it.  If you get injured while letterboxing, you<br/>
post the story here and the Purple Heart PLB comes your way. <br/>
Fortunately, I haven't gotten hurt yet. :D  The worst thing I ever did<br/>
was accidentally cross from the Blue trail to the Green trail in<br/>
post-sunset light, and come out of the park almost four miles from<br/>
where I parked the car! :D<br/>

I also have a story, not quite as dramatic as Mandas, but possibly <br/>
purple heart worthy.<br/>
<br/>
My son was bitten by a cat this last weekend while we were stamping <br/>
into some new letterboxes in our area. Two of my kids and I were <br/>
seated on the ground stamping in and this cute, nice little kitty <br/>
happened by. He was rubbing up on us and we were petting it. He was <br/>
so soft and cute. Then all of a sudden he just up and bit my son on <br/>
the arm. Hard enough to draw some blood and leave his little kitty <br/>
teeth marks on my son's arm. My son, 10, was not a happy camper and <br/>
it was enough to make him cry and get very mad at the cat. The cat <br/>
didn't look diseased and my son is fine now. We ran into a fellow <br/>
LBer at another box later that day. Our first encounter with another <br/>
letterboxer. It was very nice to meet Wild Woman and we had a great <br/>
chat. I told her of the cat and she suggested to me that my son <br/>
might get some votes for the purple heart.<br/>
<br/>
That's my story and I'm stikin' to it~<br/>

Keep an eye on the cat bite. Most cat bites will become infected from a<br/>
certain bacteria found in all cats' mouths. I know this from personal<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
It got so bad, I had to go to the doctor. He said 85 to 90% of all cat<br/>
bites will become infected. He prescribed some antibiotics. When I went to<br/>
pick them up at the pharmacy, they said, "Oh a cat bite, eh?"<br/>
<br/>
Take care and I vote your son the Purple Heart!<br/>

&gt; I also have a story, not quite as dramatic as Mandas, but possibly <br/>
&gt; purple heart worthy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My son was bitten by a cat this last weekend while we were stamping <br/>
&gt; into some new letterboxes in our area. Two of my kids and I were <br/>
&gt; seated on the ground stamping in and this cute, nice little kitty <br/>
&gt; happened by. He was rubbing up on us and we were petting it. He was <br/>
&gt; so soft and cute. Then all of a sudden he just up and bit my son on <br/>
&gt; the arm. Hard enough to draw some blood and leave his little kitty <br/>
&gt; teeth marks on my son's arm. My son, 10, was not a happy camper and <br/>
&gt; it was enough to make him cry and get very mad at the cat. The cat <br/>
&gt; didn't look diseased and my son is fine now. We ran into a fellow <br/>
&gt; LBer at another box later that day. Our first encounter with <br/>
another <br/>
&gt; letterboxer. It was very nice to meet Wild Woman and we had a great <br/>
&gt; chat. I told her of the cat and she suggested to me that my son <br/>
&gt; might get some votes for the purple heart.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That's my story and I'm stikin' to it~<br/>
