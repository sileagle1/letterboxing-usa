                    <html><body><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I received from feedback azobox, the first finder of my first letterbox. As a result, I need to make some revisions in my clues:</p>
<p align="center"><strong>KAZOO DOG'S E-Z LETTERBOXES</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Prairie View Park</strong></p>
<p align="left">Placed by Kazoo Dog with help from Joan &amp; Ellen - and six dogs</p>
<p align="left">Placed on January 1, 2003</p>
<p align="left">Nearest Town: Vicksburg or Portage, Michigan</p>
<p align="left">Kalamazoo County</p>
<p align="left">Easy Walking</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Directions: </strong>There are no changes in the directions.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Clues </strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Revised -- but retyped in the hopes they will be easier to follow:</strong></p>
<p align="left">Once you've parked your car, you will see a paved road that leads east-west; go west on this road (in winter, the road is closed to traffic, but is generally clear of snow). Continue walking west on this road, passing picnic areas and a road to a boat launch (in warm weather, if you have a water-loving dog with you, you may wish to take a side trip to the launch as dogs are allowed to swim in this area). Continuing west on the main road, you'll come to the Beach Pavilion (in some seasons, you can park in the large lot located here). Take time out at this spot to view Hogsett Lake. Exploring done, return to the road where the gate is located; there you will bear left, following the road in an easterly direction. Along the way, make sure to enjoy the sights, sounds and smells of both the forested and wetland areas you traverse. Once you've passed Area 5, you'll encounter an area that - on the right - is quite flat and wooded with a tree stump clearly visible about 35 paces away and - on the left - rises up as a small hill. There's a stump that resembles a chair on this side. Go to the stump chair; climb north 21 paces from the chair (I'm a short-legged pacer.); there's a tall straight tree standing alone there. From that tree, turn 90 degrees due east, going another another 6 paces to a pile of fallen, decaying brush and trees. Check out the east side of the fallen tree trunk to find the letterbox. Since this area could be very busy at times, you may wish to return to the stump chair or even proceed up the road to the picnic/play area to do your stamping. After you've returned the letterbox to its place, you may retrace your steps -- or continue by returning to the road, going up the road past the picnic area. Beyond that, Gourdeneck Lake can be seen on your right. You will again come to a fork in the road; take the left one, walking past the soccer fields and ultimately reaching full circle to find your car where you left it.</p>
