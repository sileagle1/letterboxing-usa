                    <div class="plaintext-content">I spoke with the art department head, Kirsten Fitzgerald, of VCU's <br/>
bookstore in Richmond, VA, and she is placing a special order for 4x6 <br/>
pink Speedball carving blocks. She will contact me when they arrive, <br/>
and I'll be happy to forward the info to the group. She didn't have <br/>
prices when I placed the request, however, and she wasn't certain how <br/>
many she'd order (I think she's in wait-and-see mode). She IS willing <br/>
to stock them regularly if she sees enough of them being purchased. <br/>
(hint, hint!)<br/>
<br/>
I recently bought 3 blocks from Art Supplies Wholesale online and <br/>
paid about $3.85 a block, plus s&amp;h. Hopefully VCU's prices will be a <br/>
little less AND we won't have to pay s&amp;h AND we can get our blocks <br/>
more quickly.<br/>
<br/>
And most Richmond-area boxers probably know that VCU's bookstore has <br/>
a great art supplies department anyway. You can get Staetdler Mars <br/>
erasers there and sketchbooks for high-quality logbooks no problem. <br/>
AND there's a Speedball starter kit that is a little cheaper than <br/>
what you can find at Michael's as well as a deluxe kit that Michael's <br/>
doesn't carry at all. There are also some stamp pads and inks that <br/>
you might want to check out, too.<br/>
