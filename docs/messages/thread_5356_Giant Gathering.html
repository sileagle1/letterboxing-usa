<div>We had a great time at the gathering Saturday, thanks Aili 
&amp; Bruce. I even managed to get my 4 year old son Craig up to the Chin for 
our second box of the day. Still can't believe that awesome climb. We lucked out 
and spotted the orange and lime tablecloths after our climb and so managed to 
meet some fellow boxers. Finally got to meet Jay, whom manages to download 
all my Letterbox clues. We really appreciate all the time you invest on the 
site. Somehow managed to just miss Wanda and Pete again after just missing them 
at Chuck &amp; Molly's "North Windham Station Letterbox". Problem is I'm a late 
riser. See you on the trails!</div>

                    <html><body><div>A belated thank you to Bruce and Aili for the great time.  Being new to letterboxing, my wife and I enjoyed meeting people with the same interests and learning from the "oldsters". As someone said in one of the thousands of e-mail that come through, we are visiting places that we would normally not see.  I have been by the Sleeping Giant Park many times, but have never even stopped in the parking lot, let alone hiking.</div> <div> </div> <div>Anyway, thanks again to the hosts and we are looking forward to meeting all of your again in the future.</div> <div> </div> <div>Boatsing/Voyageur<br/><br/></div></body></html>
