           Hello There Nice  Person <br/>
         Did Anyone Ever Tell You, <br/>
          Just  How Special You Are <br/>
           The Light that You Emit <br/>
         Might even Light a Star <br/>
<br/>
            Did Anyone Ever Tell You <br/>
          How Important You Make Others Feel <br/>
     Somebody out here is Smiling <br/>
      About Love that is so Real <br/>
<br/>
    Did Anyone Ever Tell  You <br/>
     Many Times, When They were Sad <br/>
     Your E-mail made Them Smile a bit <br/>
        In Fact It made Them Glad <br/>
<br/>
          For the Time You Spend Sending Things <br/>
        And Sharing whatever You Find <br/>
       There are No Words to Thank You <br/>
        But Somebody, Thinks You're Fine <br/>
         Did  Anyone Ever Tell You <br/>
<br/>
       Just How Much They Like You <br/>
     Well, My Dearest " Online " Friend <br/>
          Today I am Telling You <br/>
       I HOPE I GET THIS BACK <br/>
            I believe that without a <br/>
       friend you are missing out on a lot!!! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
         Don't be  confused by friends and <br/>
        acquaintances, there is a difference! <br/>
     Because I care about you, It's <br/>
        national care week . .. . and you get to <br/>
          send messages to all  your friends telling <br/>
         them that you care about them and <br/>
      make them fell good about themselves and if <br/>
        they write back .. . (just  once) then that <br/>
         means that they care about you too. <br/>
<br/>
         BUT, you have to send it right now!! <br/>
<br/>
            Send it to everyone you care about <br/>
          and if they send it back .   . <br/>
         that means they  care too. But don't just send <br/>
      it back, send it on to everyone.. <br/>
<br/>
           Have a nice day, and I'm glad we are <br/>
           friends!!! <br/>
<br/>
        THIS IS A HAND OF FRIENDSHIP <br/>
<br/>
           YOU MUST PASS IT TO  AT LEAST 4 FRIENDS!! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
