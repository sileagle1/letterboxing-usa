day out and I had 5 boxes itching for a home so out I went. I went<br/>
to Nichols Green, a superb park in our area. I managed to find<br/>
absolutely awesome spots to plant 2 boxes. After getting them<br/>
planted I started walking towards the other side of the park to<br/>
check on a box that was one of my very first plants. As I rounded a<br/>
corner I saw something scurrying across the grass. I quickly ran to<br/>
where I saw it and to my surprise it was a young armadillo. Now as<br/>
I child I had seen many of these out in the country from the safe<br/>
distance of the back of a truck. I walked up pretty close and<br/>
discovered that it was oblivious to me. I followed it around for a<br/>
while as it rooted around. Eventually it noticed me and walked up<br/>
to me. I of course had on flip flops and suddenly was worried about<br/>
my toes. He sniffed at my feet and toes and looked me up and down,<br/>
walked around me a couple of times the continued rooting around. I<br/>
watched him until he finally went back into the woods. The entire<br/>

<br/>
What a neat experience!  This kind of delightful surprise is what<br/>
prompted me to always make sure I have my camera in tow when I go<br/>
LBing.<br/>
<br/>
Early on in my LB career I would come across an incredible vista or come<br/>
nose-to-nose with a deer and wished I had a camera with me. Now I always<br/>
have my digital at my side. I take a photo of the Rosettes and me with<br/>
the box, and usually one or two other photos of the scenery or other<br/>
outstanding feature, then I paste them into my log book, complete with<br/>
a short story about the trip. Years from now it will help us remember<br/>
our adventures.<br/>

Wow, letterboxing in flip flops...that's something you'll never try in <br/>
rocky PA where boots come to die.   I guess you can be thankful it was <br/>
just an armidillo sniffing your toes and not a rattlesnake biting <br/>
them.  Is that what the gun is for?<br/>

Wow, letterboxing in flip flops...that's something you'll never try in <br/>

just an armidillo sniffing your toes and not a rattlesnake biting <br/>
them.  Is that what the gun is for?<br/>
