Isn't a debate when people of differing views state their points, and <br/>
then just leave it at that? I don't see why we need a million posts, <br/>
just because you have a different view from someone else.  If someone <br/>
doesn't agree with you (which seems to happen often here) let them <br/>
state their opinions, and let it go.  It seems these "debates" on <br/>
this list always have a tendency to get out of hand.  If you <br/>
disagree, that's fine, just don't continue to hammer in your point. <br/>
If there has to be an argument, send the emails offlist.  I <br/>
understand that this is something that can affect everyone here down <br/>
the road, and it's good to see people supporting the activity.  And I <br/>
have nothing against everyone saying their piece, don't get me wrong, <br/>
but just if someone posts an opinion contrary to yours, let it go. <br/>
We're here for letterboxing, not debating or refereeing.<br/>
  My two cents :)<br/>

I strongly believe debate is a good thing when conducted in a <br/>
respectful manner and the content is something important. In this <br/>
case the subject matter, the future of letterboxing in public lands, <br/>
is probably the most important thing we could possibly discuss on <br/>
this list. Also important, if you read the exchanges between Randy <br/>
and myself, you will notice there is no animosity involved. We are <br/>
trying to talk about issues that are central to what will happen to <br/>
letterboxing in the future. FWIW I believe this subject is central to <br/>
the direction of the hobby. Just because some people may not agree <br/>
does not mean they need to be hostile to each other. I have great <br/>
respect for Randy and actually I think we agree for the most part <br/>
about many aspects of this problem. Open discussion without personal <br/>
attacks is central to  progress in any subject matter. I hope many <br/>
others will post about their feelings on this issue and maybe someday <br/>
there will be some resolution. It's just a matter of doing it with <br/>
respect for the right to disagree.<br/>

First: I agree on the above statements a) respect each other, b) use of<br/>
public land is important and most very likely important to the future of<br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestion ; is it possible to create a folder or link in the home page<br/>
or through egroups so when there is a debate those interested can<br/>
exchange views off the main list?-Warren Remein , theBayboxer<br/>
