<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Quick note, and I'll post more on Sunday.  
I'll be at the Gathering in CT on Saturday.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway... the letterbox near the curved bench at 
Odiorne Point Seacoast Nature Ctr has gone missing.  Or it may still be 
there, but people have moved the rocks.  They do that, scavenging for rocks 
to create makeshift campfires with.  I've tried four times to locate the 
box, and frankly, it can't possibly be that hard to find.  If I'm missing 
the obvious, will someone please explain it?  Otherwise, I think the box is 
missing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The letterbox up past the concrete bunker is still 
there, but it got soaked when the snow melted.  I've removed the soggy mess 
that was once (and may yet be again) the notebook; I'll have it with me at the 
Gathering if it belongs to anyone there. Otherwise, I'll dry it out and either 
replace it in the box (doubt if it can be salvaged) or put a new notebook in the 
box.  If it's your notebook, holler and I'll cheerfully mail it to you when 
it's dry. It appeared nearly full anyway.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've added a letterbox myself, but this MAY be a 
temporary location... I think it's a little too close to civilization, and I'll 
move it to a more secluded spot when I replace the notebook in the other box, or 
in about a week, whichever comes first.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'll post the clues at my website, but until I move 
the new box, here's where it is:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Follow the clues as if you're going to the Rye 
Beach letterbox, which is the more hidden one at Odiorne Point Seacoast Nature 
Ctr.  When you reach the big concrete bunker (looks like a bridge, sort 
of), face it as if you're going underneath it.  On your left, there 
are five boulders lining the path/road under the bunker.  The second from 
the path you arrived on is where the treasure is.  Sit on the boulder with 
your back to the path, and retie your shoelacings or something.  Reach down 
carefully and move the two small rocks (about the size of a shoe, each) and 
underneath the boulder you're sitting on,  you'll find the Seacoast #1 
letterbox.  Handcarved stamp inside.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Stamp discreetly and replace the box, hide it with 
the two small rocks again, and then continue on the path to the Rye Beach 
letterbox.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And, with environmental impact in mind, you do NOT 
have to move any large boulders to reach the letterbox.  It just happens 
that there's a narrow opening on that side of the rock, where it doesn't quite 
meet the ground.  So, the only moving necessary will be the two smallish 
rocks that hide the box from view.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This box should be easy to find, and if you go 
around the hill with the stairs (at the start of the Rye Beach clues) accessing 
the path from the road instead, there is almost no climbing necessary.  In 
other words, a very easy &amp; gentle hike, maybe 1/2 mile in.  (But, for 
the views, I recommend the hill with the stairs.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>See many of you tomorrow!</div>
<div><br/>Cheerfully,</div>

We couldn't find it on our first and only try so far, but I know that others
just before and just after us found it without a problem.  We also
planted another letterbox there, but a year later we have yet to post the
clues.  We want to make sure it's still there (and get another chance
at finding the one by the curved bench) before posting the clues.

<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I made yet another try at locating that letterbox 
by the curved bench at Odiorne.  (Hope springs eternal.)  If there's 
more than one curved bench, will someone explain to me where it is, in words of 
one syllable or less?  The only bench I know of is a favorite picnic 
spot, nicely overgrown and yes, on the map it's in line with the four gun 
whatchamacallits.  So, in six tries and having turned over more rocks than 
I like to, I'm about to give up on that letterbox. (And, believe me, "give up" 
is not usually in my vocabulary! *grin*)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If the letterbox really is there, congratulations 
to whomever planted it.  You've not only evaded the kids who go there to 
drink &amp; build fires, but I'm baffled as well! *grin*</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While there, I did replace the logbook in the 
Seacoast/Rye Beach box at Odiorne, and put everything in fresh ziplock bags for 
protection from the elements.  The box itself is cracked, so on my next 
visit I'll replace it with an identical (but new) Rubbermaid container.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If anyone's going to that box, please pick up a 
couple of fist-sized rocks as you climb the trail.  In a ziplock bag, the 
box isn't so concealed as it was before, when two rocks could cover it 
nicely.  Two more rocks added by the next visitor should keep it safely 
hidden.  I couldn't find any loose rocks to add today, in the immediate 
vicinity of the letterbox.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm leaving my Seacoast #1 box at the second rock 
from the path (going to the Seacoast/Rye Beach letterbox at Odiorne), on the 
left as you face that first concrete bunker (or bridge, if that's how you think 
of it).  And I planted a second box today, Seacoast #2 (for lack of a more 
clever name) at the Urban Forestry Ctr in Portsmouth.  I'll post clues to 
both in the next day or so.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, if you're letterboxing around the Portsmouth 
area, we've launched into poison ivy season.  With the exception of the 
short trek to the curved bench, if you're hiking at coastal NH, wear 
long pants or tallllll socks!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was a gorgeous day for letterboxing (after SNOW 
yesterday!), and I'm sore &amp; tired from a great day of hiking.  Does 
everyone/anyone else seem to hike about three times as far, trying to plant a 
letterbox as trying to find one?  I must have done the two-mile loop of the 
Urban Forestry trails three times before I found a hiding place that I liked.
