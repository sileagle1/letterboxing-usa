<br/>
I'm not telling you not to plant out there, and because the islands <br/>
are run by a partnership as you point out, they may be OK.  After <br/>
all, the NPS isn't the sole administrator of the islands, so if the <br/>
Dept. of Conservation and Recreation has no problem with letterboxes, <br/>
why not place, right?<br/>
<br/>
However, from the NPS website:<br/>
"Boston Harbor Islands national park area includes 34 islands <br/>
situated within the Greater Boston shoreline. The 34 islands are <br/>
managed by a unique, 13-member Partnership which includes the <br/>
National Park Service and other public and private organizations. An <br/>
advisory council provides a mechanism for public involvement."<br/>
<br/>
The website includes a lot of official information about the islands, <br/>
including the partnership's by-laws, charter, general management <br/>
plan, and the legislation that regulates the park.<br/>
<br/>
The General Management Plan (<br/>
http://www.nps.gov/boha/parkdocs/fgmp/BOHA_gmp.pdf) states in part:<br/>
<br/>
"Congress established the Boston Harbor Islands as a unit of the <br/>
national park system in 1996. Rather than having the National Park<br/>
Service (NPS) own and manage the park, the law makes NPS a nonland-<br/>
owning participant in the Boston Harbor Islands Partnership and <br/>
directs the Partnership "to coordinate the activities of the<br/>
Federal, <br/>
State, and local authorities and the private sector in the <br/>
development and implementation of "a general management plan.<br/>
The enabling legislation established a 13-member body consisting of: <br/>
National Park Service, U.S. Coast Guard, Massachusetts Department<br/>
of Environmental Management, Metropolitan District Commission, <br/>
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, Massachusetts Port<br/>
Authority, City of Boston, Boston Redevelopment Authority, Thompson <br/>
Island Outward Bound Education Center, The Trustees of Reservations,<br/>
Island Alliance, and Boston Harbor Islands Advisory Council."<br/>
<br/>
It goes on to state:<br/>
"The National Park Service's role is to help coordinate the <br/>
Partnership and Advisory Council, to provide information and <br/>
orientation to the public, to develop and operate programs, and to<br/>
help assure that the park will be managed to NPS standards, as the <br/>
law requires."<br/>
<br/>
And continues:<br/>
"Associated with each mission goal is a set of policies relevant for <br/>
this park. The Boston Harbor Islands policies build on the park's<br/>
legislated mandates and Park Service policy that applies to the <br/>
national system."<br/>
<br/>
More important excerpts:<br/>
"The federal enabling legislation for the park requires that<br/>
the island system be administered in accordance with laws<br/>
applicable to the national park system."<br/>
<br/>
"The Boston Harbor Islands policies build on the park's<br/>
legislated mandates and Park Service policy that applies to<br/>
the national system."<br/>
<br/>
Now, the Plan does not list the NPS as owning any of the islands (to <br/>
the best of my knowledge all islands are owned by other members of <br/>
the Partnership, as follows:<br/>
<br/>
"The United States owns three lighthouses on islands in the park<br/>
Boston Light, Long Island Head Light, and The Graves Light, as well <br/>
as the navigational marker Nixes Mate and the freestanding Deer <br/>
Island Light, not in the park, off the tip of Deer Island."<br/>
<br/>
"Massachusetts Department of Environmental Management ... is the <br/>
agency that operates the state's 19 forests and parks system. It<br/>
has <br/>
managed 13 islands in Boston Harbor Islands State Park since the <br/>
1970s: Bumpkin, Gallops, Grape, Great Brewster, Middle Brewster, <br/>
Outer Brewster, Calf, Little Calf, Green, Hangman, Raccoon, Slate, <br/>
and Sheep. It also manages Spectacle Island jointly with the City of <br/>
Boston."<br/>
<br/>
"Metropolitan District Commission ... managed three islands<br/>
of the state park, starting in the late 1950s with the<br/>
acquisition of one island.  The islands are Georges, Lovells,<br/>
and Peddocks."<br/>
<br/>
"Massachusetts Water Resources Authority ... operates two facilities<br/>
within the park: Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant and Nut <br/>
Island Headworks."<br/>
<br/>
"Massport does not directly own or operate any of the Boston Harbor <br/>
Islands"<br/>
<br/>
"The City of Boston owns Long, Moon, and Rainsford islands, and part <br/>
of Spectacle Island."<br/>
<br/>
"Thompson Island today is owned and managed by a private nonprofit <br/>
educational institution"<br/>
<br/>
"The Trustees of Reservations owns and manages Worlds End for public <br/>
recreational uses"<br/>
<br/>
"The Town of Hingham owns and manages Langlee, Sarah, Ragged, and <br/>
Button islands in Hingham Harbor as conservation land."<br/>
<br/>
A chart on page 22 of the report lists the managers of every island <br/>
in the park.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, in my opinion, it is unclear whether the islands are available <br/>
to letterboxers.  It seems they are owned and managed by a bunch of <br/>
governments, agencies, and organizations that may or may not prohibit <br/>
the activity, but all are controlled by a policy based on the <br/>
National Park Service policies.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you determine that it's ok to place letterboxes on the <br/>
islands, some islands should be avoided:<br/>
"Fragile islands, such as Snake, Sheep, Green, Calf, Little Calf, and <br/>
Hangman, are highly restricted to protect habitat."<br/>
<br/>
I suppose, I'd say go ahead and plant if you'd like -- I'd certainly <br/>
be willing to find the boxes you put there -- but be careful on which <br/>
islands you choose.  Fragile habitats exist throughout the park.  <br/>
Research the island before planting a box (you can do this at the NPS <br/>
website or at bostonislands.com) and be happy if the boxes survive, <br/>
but don't be surprised if they are confiscated.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps placing a few boxes and seeing what happens is the best way <br/>
to solve the puzzle.  Or, I suppose, we could contact the NPS and <br/>
ask, although I'm fairly sure they'll say the islands are under their <br/>
domain and thus you can't plant, even if that's not the true answer.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing -- I was searching the NPS website for the policy that <br/>
disallowed geocaching and letterboxing.  The only reference to <br/>
letterboxing I found was on the Conservation Institute's website, a <br/>
part of the NPS site (the institute was founded by the NPS) which <br/>
advertises a book called "<br/>
Questing: A Guide to Creating Community Treasure Hunts".<br/>
<br/>
Go figure.<br/>

&gt; Ok,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So curiosity got the better of me and I decided to check the Boston <br/>
&gt; Harbor Islands website.  It turns out that almost all the Islands <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; managed by Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation <br/>
&gt; (used to be the Department of Environmental Management and <br/>
&gt; Metropolitan District Commission but the merged into the Department <br/>
&gt; of Conservation and Recreation last year).  This is the same <br/>
&gt; department that manages our state forest and parks and our urban <br/>
&gt; parks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Islands managed by DCR:<br/>
&gt; Bumpkin<br/>
&gt; Gallops<br/>
&gt; Georges<br/>
&gt; Grape<br/>
&gt; Great Brewster<br/>
&gt; Lovells<br/>
&gt; Peddocks<br/>
&gt; Spectacle<br/>
&gt; Thompson<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only exceptions were:<br/>
&gt; Deer Island - managed by the Massachusetts Water Resource Authority<br/>
&gt; Little Brewster Island - managed by the U.S. Coast Guard<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So lets go plant!<br/>

It is in the nature of islands to collect flotsam and jetsam, some of <br/>
which can find its way to surprisingly high ground during storms.<br/>
