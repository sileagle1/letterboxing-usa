It's a log book(no stamp) that has clues to find a box that is not published on the list (or anywhere else.)  You stamp in to the log book and take it with you to a new box.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A couple of further questions on the cuckoo clue thing...  I <br/>
understand that the clues are not published anywhere, but is the box <br/>
listed anywhere (noting that it is a cuckoo)?  Are there a lot of <br/>
them about?  When you find one, do you e-mail the owner or anything?<br/>
<br/>
Also, my understanding is that when you find a cuckoo clue, you would <br/>
stamp into the log book, which contains the clues and stamps of those <br/>
who have found it, and then place it into the next box you visit, <br/>
like a hitchhiker.  I am assuming it's okay to make a copy of the <br/>
clue to the box before replanting, rather than holding onto it until <br/>
you actually find the elusive box?  In this scenario, one could <br/>
potentially find a cuckoo clue for a box on the east coast hiding in <br/>
a box on the west coast?<br/>
<br/>
Is it okay to limit the scope of the boxes where it can be <br/>
replanted?  For instance, if I have a series of 10 boxes in a <br/>
particular park and plant a cuckoo clue to an 11th box in one of <br/>
them, is it okay to ask the finder(s) to replant it in another box <br/>
within the series (or leave it where it is if they are not going to <br/>
be visiting other boxes within that park)?<br/>
<br/>
It is an intriguing concept.  You must have been so thrilled when you <br/>
found it!<br/>

find the nest. In the nest is the log book and a wonderful stamp. One<br/>
does not remove any of this but then places the pink card into another<br/>
box somewhere else [like a HH]  Is is great fun. And of course since it<br/>
was a Drew box, the nest contained a 'bonus' clue to another box, and<br/>
since this dud head has not solved the clues, I have not found the bonus<br/>
box.!! Who knows how many there are out there.<br/>

first. She has hidden an unpublished box somewhere. This contains <br/>
clues to that box. You stamp into the cuckoo clue logbook. Copy the <br/>
clues. You can either leave the cuckoo clue in the box where you <br/>
found it or find a new home for it. Like a HH. I chose to move it. <br/>
When it is moved it is logged into its new home. That is you stamp <br/>
the new homes stamp into the cuchkoo clue logbook. Since it doesn't <br/>
have a stamp I suppose you can write into the new homes book that it <br/>
was there visiting. Really just do what is logical, just don't put it <br/>
into the unpublished box. <br/>
   Just a thought, maybe this is one way to get around hiding boxes <br/>
in National Parks. Just make them all cuckoo clues. It would be less <br/>
traffic to the boxes. And the NPS can't get the clues off the Clue <br/>
List to go find the boxes.<br/>
   I know this appears to be contradictory to what I wrote yesterday, <br/>
regarding the NPS and going along with them and their "RULES". I'm <br/>
playing politician here- talking out of both sides of my mouth. <br/>
Someone is going to "break the rules". This idea just popped into my <br/>
head. Just a thought.<br/>

    Since I had never found one before I can only go by what Squirrel <br/>
requested. This was how she set up hers. I suppose it can work either <br/>
way. We (Mid Atlantic) do things a bit different but then again it's <br/>
not too far off. As the FAQ page reads, "There are no rules" be <br/>
creative. <br/>
