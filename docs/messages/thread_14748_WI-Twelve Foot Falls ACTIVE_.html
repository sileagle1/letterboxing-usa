FIND the Twelve Foot Falls LB on my trip a few weeks ago.  I was the first<br/>
there in over two years.  The box is in surprisingly good shape, but the<br/>
stamp isn't too thrilling.  If you attempt to go find it, be aware that you<br/>
must travel on dirt roads for a few miles, and they remind one of driving on<br/>
a washboard.  The falls are nice.  The clues are vague as suggested.  If you<br/>
want more detailed clues, just drop me an email.<br/>

I can understand your disappointment when you travel all day to find the LB, and then you are not dazzled by the owner's stamp, but I think it is important to notice that not everyone is a Leonardo Divinci.  These are hand crafted from the simplest of materials and I think we should all be proud of our stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>
