individual stamp,yes,but also a stamp(not the SAME of corse) that shows your in the <br/>
group,stamps with a name or something of that nature. I think it would be cool, <br/>
if you say yes we should have this,or if you do not think it i a good <br/>
idea,e~mail the group about it! I would like to hear your opinouns,ALSO,I was wondering <br/>
if the gorup would like me to make a hitchiker  about the online <br/>
group........E~mail your opinouns,Thanks!<br/>
