around Morro Bay.<br/>
<br/>
We did 7 geocaches, 3 virtual geocaches and 3 letterboxes and had a <br/>
wonderful time.<br/>
<br/>
The first I did alone as Simon was kayaking across to the sandspit.<br/>

This is a favourite area of mine to visit. There were a couple of people <br/>
admiring the view as I did too, while watching Simon, a tiny dot by now, <br/>
well on his way exploring the sandspit. I found the box, great clues and I <br/>
loved using my compass. Took the box up to the seat at the viewpoint and <br/>
stamped in. Great stamp. I had not been letterboxing for some time and could <br/>
not find my hand carved stamp so I used one from my scrapbooking supplies. <br/>
Replaced the box, covered my tracks and went on my way to meet Simon for <br/>
lunch at the Bayside Cafe, highly recommended. Thanks Don and Gwen!!<br/>

The St. Patricks' Fliers Letterbox: pandora and members of "GoogleD"<br/>
<br/>
We found this special grove two years ago  when a friendly native down on <br/>
the beach stopped to talk to us about birds and butterflies when we were <br/>
birdwatching on the dunes. She told us to continue along the path we were on <br/>
and to enter the grove. That time the fliers were still around but this time <br/>
we only saw one or two but we did find the letterbox, perfect stamp for the <br/>
site. Several boxers had stamped in the day before.<br/>
Thanks pandora &amp;co<br/>

The Rock &amp; the Heron: Ron &amp; Kevin<br/>
<br/>
Would never have stopped here as we always like to get to the bluff trail to <br/>
see the view from there if it had not been for this letterbox. This is the <br/>
first letterbox or cache I've seen hidden in this way. Very good camo job. <br/>
Love the stamp, I had my ink pens with me so was able to colour each <br/>
element.<br/>
Thanks Ron &amp; Kevin<br/>
<br/>
I was thrilled to see Ryan and Amanda's stamps in this area and wished I'd <br/>
had more time to do their boxes. Will have to save them for another time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys for a great weekend.<br/>
