Before I get into this let me warn you, the wooded trail part of <br/>
this journey is VERY slippery when wet, leaves on top of rocks some <br/>
of which are loose. As you walk up the *trail before you get to the <br/>
top you may want to walk to your left about 15 yards before <br/>
continuing up. There is a very steep drop off. Also from time to <br/>
time there are paintballers here. Although not posted near the box <br/>
there are some areas that are restricted, please be careful. If you <br/>
feel the need to replace the stamp, I wont be offended, lol. <br/>
<br/>
Adequate parking as there is a park before the road closes.<br/>
