<div>What do you think of a letterbox chain tied to 
Interstate Highway rest stops? I was traveling back from the beach last week 
after placing my first box and having kids, had to stop at several of the I-95 
and I-40 stops. I want to visit the local, I-95 stop here in 
Fredericksburg, and figure out the best place to hide one, but there has 
got to be a place to hide a box very near to the fence line so the grass cutters 
and maintenace people won't stumble over it.....</div>

How do you hide something in plain site?<br/>
I have been trying to deal with this problem too.<br/>
I want to put some boxes in some heavily trafficed areas.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of the old hollow rock trick<br/>
you can get fake rocks from Home depot. that are just fiberglass<br/>
shells.<br/>
They would be pretty expensive though if you were putting out lots<br/>
of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
my other thought is the kind of small in ground box you put sprinklers or <br/>
valves in. Especially if you can find one marked sewer.<br/>

There was some discussion at one point about "plugging."  I believe this<br/>
practice of cutting into sod is practiced in Dartmoor to some extent. <br/>
In general I try not to disturb the area in which I have planted boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Mitch had some interesting camoflauge techniques for the boxes he<br/>
planted in high traffic areas.  He eventually pulled or did not replace<br/>
when these boxes when they came up missing.<br/>

Hey thanks! I am new at this and appreciate the info.<br/>
<br/>
Some places I was thinking about have stepping stones. would lifting a  <br/>
stepping stone and putting the box beneath be considered digging?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
on another note,<br/>
I made my stamp from speedball speedy cut.<br/>
It was in my beltpack and it broke in half... bummer.<br/>

	"Plugging" only works well in wet rainy areas where the sod plug and<br/>
its plants aon't dry out &amp; die.  Regarding the fence line, I assume you<br/>
meant a back fence far away from zooming cars?   an interstate, hmmm, we<br/>
have one up here in Vermont!  There are lots of trees in the rest areas,<br/>
could a box look like a birds nest?<br/>

&gt; What do you think of a letterbox chain tied to Interstate Highway rest stops?<br/>
<br/>
I personally prefer boxes and clues with more of a Dartmoor feel or a puzzle<br/>
to them, or boxes in more remote areas.  That is why I prefer Valley Forge <br/>
which has as close to a moorland feel as you can get around where I live<br/>
(its actually alot of rolling grassland but you can get the feel anyway<br/>
if the weather is right ...) or the mystery boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I also think zero chance of accidental discovery is important.<br/>
<br/>
I think if enough boxes with any theme are placed, a series on the site can<br/>
be arranged, but right now the webmasters don't have time to do it so<br/>
someone else will have to volunteer.<br/>
