&gt; It's an east coast/midwest thing, Sir B.  While it's true that it <br/>
confounds us westerners how those people manage, they do indeed <br/>
include inkpads in their boxes.  They somehow seem to have placed <br/>
hundreds of 'em, in fact.  Go figure.<br/>

Wooowhee! We are in the wrong business! I want to be selling inkpads. <br/>
But wait, that must make the boxes so large. How the heck do they get <br/>
an ink pad into a film cannister? Maybe they are hollowing out rocks? <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of hollow rocks, the fake rocks I made out of plaster seem <br/>
to be holding up pretty well. I think I will pull them back in to <br/>
give them another spray of plastic before the rains come.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody else out there making fake rocks or hollowing out real ones?<br/>

Hey Sir B.<br/>
Are you going to give instructions on how to carve out a real rock? <br/>
Do we need to bring a jack hammer along? LOL<br/>
