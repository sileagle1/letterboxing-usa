I can't believe no one has mentioned the new book that is out by<br/>
Michael Stadther, "A Treasure's Trove". In the story are clues to<br/>
hidden treasures in the Continental US. Find the coin and cash it in<br/>
for a beautiful designed gem-filled bug worth thousands of dollars.<br/>
All total 1 million dollars.<br/>
<br/>
Now that's my kind of hunting!<br/>

My dad was telling me on Christmas that he saw the author of this <br/>
book interviewed on television (he said it reminded him of my silly <br/>
letterboxing hobby).  He couldn't really tell me much about it, but <br/>
as he was explaining it I told him I was pretty sure it would be the <br/>
talk of this group board so I'm a bit surprised too.  Talk about a <br/>
cash-cow for the author, the guy must be brilliant.  Anyone know <br/>
where we can find out more?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Have you heard of "Masquerade"? I don't know if it was the first<br/>
armchair treasure hunt book (published in 1979), but it certainly is<br/>
the most famous of all the ones published in the past quarter century.<br/>
I think this newest book has far and away the biggest prize though.<br/>
Good luck to all who seek the treasure!<br/>

I found one hunt (closed now) which had a larger prize -- 1 million<br/>
British pounds -- though the hunt closed before anyone solved it.<br/>
