Just a quick (though long) note on the "list options" <br/>
thread ... for those who asked ... (and prolly more<br/>
than anyone wanted ... :-))<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I happen to agree with Graham in regards <br/>
to these issues (i.e., openness -- allow <br/>
attachments and allow non-members to post).  <br/>
I also get the sense from reading some of the <br/>
posts that a preponderance of the opinion expressed <br/>
is along these lines as well.  The idea of the <br/>
list is to be as loose and open as reasonable <br/>
and practical, while keeping a sense of community.  <br/>
List policy is decided, ideally, by consensus (but <br/>
more on that later) -- my opinion should not be <br/>
that important for shaping list policy.<br/>
<br/>
If the issue is simply spam (on the member/non-member<br/>
issue), then I would point out that the volume of <br/>
discussion of the issue possibly exceeded the <br/>
volume of the spam :-)<br/>
<br/>
These 2 issues have been coming up since the <br/>
beginning of time in many internet communities <br/>
over the years (including this one).  I wager <br/>
they will come up one or two more times on this <br/>
list by next spring.  The problem with these <br/>
issues is that people are divided on them, and <br/>
consensus is not possible to reach (or at least I <br/>
have never seen it reached on a large list).  I <br/>
will offer the opinion that attempting to reach <br/>
a consensus on these issues on this list is a <br/>
waste of time, but people are free to try ...<br/>
<br/>
What then, is the best approach to handling a<br/>
such issues?  Most lists I am on handle them <br/>
by fiat of the list managers, and the issues usually <br/>
only come up when the options are set to "open"<br/>
(because people respond to "active bother" caused <br/>
by the openness, but don't respond to the "passive <br/>
bother", if you will, brought about by "closed" <br/>
options (hopefully people get this point without <br/>
further elaboration ...).  Furthermore, The <br/>
situation is slightly different here because the <br/>
content itself on this list can be part of the game, <br/>
rather than just noise as it is on most lists.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, no matter how you set these options, a <br/>
significant fraction of the list will want them <br/>
the other way.  It is that way now (possibly), and<br/>
will be that way if we change them.  It turns out<br/>
that, logically anyway, if you leave the list options<br/>
"open", then people can take steps personally to <br/>
"close" them on their own systems (by using mail<br/>
filters, spam filters, read on the web, virus scanners, <br/>
operating systems and mail programs that are better<br/>
designed than others, etc) --  yet if you set the <br/>
options to "closed", people cannot do much personally <br/>
if they like them "open".  <br/>
<br/>
So, as a personal philosophy, I tend toward <br/>
decentralised decision making by individuals rather <br/>
than centralised decision making for all.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this assumes that the issue is fairly evenly <br/>
split.  If a poll were to show a huge majority (and<br/>
don't ask me what huge is because I'm not sure), then<br/>
I would honor that.  For example, if only 2 people<br/>
wanted the options open, and everyone else wanted them<br/>
closed, then I would close them.  If it were about <br/>
51-49%, I most likely would not make a decision that <br/>
would leave 49% of the list in a situation where <br/>
there was nothing personally that could be done.  (Feel<br/>
free to explore further or start a poll, or explore what<br/>
majority would be appropriate ...)<br/>
<br/>
Just MHO ... :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
