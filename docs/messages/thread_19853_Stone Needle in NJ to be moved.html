a faint<br/>
trail is beginning to form.  When it was first placed, there wasn't <br/>
much<br/>
traffic, maybe one a month at most.  Now that's changed.  Recently a <br/>
high<br/>
School club found the box with about 10 kids at once.  I'm going to <br/>
keep the<br/>
first half  of clues the same and changing the final clues to end up <br/>
at a<br/>
slightly different spot where there already is worn trails and it <br/>
can't do<br/>
much damage.  I scouted it out today.  So stay tuned and I'll fill <br/>
you in as<br/>
soon as I make the move.<br/>
