glorious 45degree weather yesterday we took a peek to see if it was <br/>
gone missing. It ain't! It's happily esconced in its "butt-end" <br/>
hiding place. Still, it has only been visited twice in the year since <br/>
we placed it, and that by the "usual suspects." Sorry you missed it <br/>
but glad you enjoyed the terrific hike for Dan &amp; Melissa's boxes at <br/>
the covered bridge!<br/>
