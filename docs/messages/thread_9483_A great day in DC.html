What a day (despite the cold and wind)!  We headed into DC early and had a <br/>
great time!  We got to see Da's new office and ride a metro train  -- a <br/>
first for Ma (a second for Be)!  That alone would have been enough -- but no <br/>
-- there's more (this is as exciting as our life gets -- but we like it that <br/>
way).  We went to the Smithsonian and stamped in at that cool site.  What <br/>
fun and we liked the hinged stamp!  The water fountain is fairly hidden and <br/>
I think it is easy to get to without arousing suspicion.  The guards were <br/>
very nice.  They were very interested in my flashlight (a new addition since <br/>
or days of wandering in the woods at dusk...)  The paper is so delicate.  It <br/>
would be great to see it displayed one day.  But, even if not, it was a <br/>
great excuse to go into DC which we don't do often enough (one never seems <br/>
to visit one's own backyard).  The wind blew us across the mall to the <br/>
Natural History museum where the guards were once again very interested in <br/>
our flashlight.  They stuck a stick in our pack (which I discovered later)  <br/>
I don't know if this is a "sign" saying our pack had been checked and we <br/>
were ok or "watch out -- this family is strange...".  But, now, we have a <br/>
new official "poking stick" for when we go back in the woods!<br/>
<br/>
Being so close by, we went over to National Geographic.  A note to those who <br/>
couldn't find the box.  There is confusion, I bet, over which squares to <br/>
count.  If you count the wrong squares, you too end up by a junction box.  <br/>
And, to judge by the mini crater dug underneath it....  We went back to the <br/>
spot two more times thinking maybe someone was stamping it at the time.  <br/>
Then, on the way back from the bathroom in the building across the courtyard <br/>
(the ones in National Geographic are undergoing renovations) Mom BeMa <br/>
decided to go with her original idea of which squares to count and VOILA -- <br/>
it was there!<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to let anyone out there with young kids (or not so young) know that <br/>
the exhibit currently at National Georgraphic is great!  I guess the Egypt <br/>
exhibit was there when the box was originally planted.  It is now a series <br/>
of wild life photography with some very colorful photos.  There are great <br/>
blow ups of tiny, wild caterpillars and some great camouflage shots.  The <br/>
kids really enjoyed it!  Then, if you go a little further, there is a <br/>
wonderful very hands on exhibit on biodiversity.  There are also sorts of <br/>
buttons to push, computers to try, sing a longs to sing a long with, etc.  <br/>
Perfect for a cold, windy day outside.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to legerdemaine and the doubtful guests for encouraging us to come <br/>
into DC and have this wonderful day!<br/>
