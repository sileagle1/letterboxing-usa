<br/>
First off, I want to say thanks to Der Mad Stamper for updating the<br/>
website!  Thanks so much for putting new notes on my missing boxes,<br/>
Mitch.<br/>
<br/>
I've taken a look at Eric Ming's and the Coxes letterboxing sites and I<br/>
think they are great.  As long as everyone has the hobby's best interest<br/>
in mind it looks like valuable contributions can be made and<br/>
letterboxing is ALL THAT, so there's definitely room for growth and new<br/>
ideas.  This site will probably remain my tried and true favorite but<br/>
the others will be excellent compliments.<br/>
<br/>
I spent an excellent weekend with my cousin in Northern California at<br/>
Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park (accessible only by boat) and, wouldn't<br/>
you know it, we just had to place a letterbox while we were at it!<br/>
Clues will be forthcoming once I get them coherent and organized.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks everybody!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

Yes, I have a bad habit of "accidentally" placing letterboxes too.  <br/>
Someday I hope to grow out of it and start placing them <br/>
intentionally.  =)<br/>
