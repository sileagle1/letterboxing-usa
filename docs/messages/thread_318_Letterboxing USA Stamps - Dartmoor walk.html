If you have the first stamp in your state and you do not<br/>
publish the stamp image and you do not want it to be seen<br/>
any other way than by solving the clues then feel free to<br/>
not submit it.<br/>
<br/>
If you do want to submit a stamp (typically the first stamp in<br/>
each state would be elected), then do one of the following things.<br/>
<br/>
1)  Snail mail a copy<br/>
    of it to Adrian.<br/>
    (snail mail is the U.S. postal service<br/>
     for those of you who may not know that)<br/>
<br/>
1a) Send an actual copy of the stamp to Adrian<br/>
    (not the original stamp, but a recarved copy)<br/>
<br/>
2)  Let Adrian know where<br/>
    your stamp is on the web.<br/>
    http://www.pclink.com/elf/sturgeon.htm<br/>
    for example, for Wisconsin.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Email your stamp to Adrian<br/>
    as an attachment.<br/>
<br/>
If you can think of some other way to get the <br/>
information to him feel free.<br/>
<br/>
Adrian, what is your snail mail addy? <br/>
<br/>
Dan'l<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ps.  A bonus stamp may be included at Adrian's discretion<br/>
(a stamp, not the 1st in the state but by agreement to be<br/>
included in their walk).  I'm sure this is necessary as<br/>
they have limited resources.  Its not practical to include<br/>
every stamp.  However, if it comes down to it, if someone<br/>
would like to submit their stamp , and it is not possible<br/>
for some reason, let me know and I will sacrifice the place<br/>
for my stamp to that person (if that is OK).<br/>
