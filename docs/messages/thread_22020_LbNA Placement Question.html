<br/>
My only minor problem is that I've never really been sure where I was supposed to post my clues on LbNA. I finally stopped adding my clues there as I never felt that my "boxes" really fit into any of the categories. Since my contributions to the letterboxing world are all virtual letterboxes, they really don't fit into any of the "physical" box areas . . . which only leaves "mystery", but they're not mystery boxes either. <br/>
<br/>
I started placing them in the "mystery" category, but then I didn't know what to fill in for the city/location. I finally decided to put the city/area where I physically live, not the box location since there is no physical one for it. <br/>
<br/>
That is the one feature I really like about AC, the ability to choose the box category rather than a location category. Adding my clues/boxes using a box category is a whole lot easier for me. However, I do like the map feature on LbNA or being able to choose a location if I were to go on vacation and want to look up by where I will be traveling. <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions how to place virtual letterboxes on LbNA would be greatly appreciated. <br/>
