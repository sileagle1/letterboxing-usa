Find a gemm of a location in Oregon where a mighty band gathers. See <br/>
the band almost any day November through April and occasionally the <br/>
rest of the year. If you go early mornings in mid-September to mid-<br/>
October you may be lucky enough so hear the band of brothers blowing <br/>
their bugles. Once you've found this location, head west a few miles <br/>
to a wooden abode where finned and feathered friends fall. Once <br/>
there, head towards the top. You will find what you seek stashed in <br/>
the south and shorter Siamese snag.<br/>

My wife, Beth, and I claim victory to being the first to find and <br/>
stamp in on the Bugle Mystery Letterbox today!  Thanks for the fun <br/>
and a beautiful fall day it was.<br/>
<br/>
Rumor has it a long-distance hitchiker was seen lurking in the area <br/>
too!<br/>
