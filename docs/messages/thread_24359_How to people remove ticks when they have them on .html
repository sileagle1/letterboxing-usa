                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry, but I don't know if this will post as a link or<br/>
not.  This is from the CDC:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/lyme/ld_tickremoval.htm<br/>
<br/>
They don't explain on this page why they say do not<br/>
use petroleum jelly, hot match, fingernail polish, etc<br/>
but I've read that this may cause the tick to<br/>
regurgitate which could increase your chance of<br/>
getting a tick borne disease. <br/>
<br/>
I use sticky tape to remove ticks that are not<br/>
attached but may be hiding on my clothes or skin.  I<br/>
wouldn't suggest using tape to remove an attached<br/>
tick.  You are  likely to leave the head.  tweezers or<br/>
a tick removal "spoon" are your best bets.  Just get<br/>
in there and do it.  It's better to have it off you<br/>
than on whether you leave the head or not.     <br/>
