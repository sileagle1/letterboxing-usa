LETTERBOXING<br/>
Ithaca is a unique, small city in central New York (Tompkins County). <br/>
It is located on Cayuga Lake, one of the Finger Lake formed thousands <br/>
of years ago by huge glaciers which left behind spectacular gorges.<br/>
Ithaca is home to 29,000 residents and nearly as many college <br/>
students.<br/>
<br/>
                                 The Cornell Plantations is an outdoor<br/>
museum where you can enjoy over three thousand acres of natural beauty <br/>
adjacent to the Cornell University campus.  The botanical garden <br/>
features fourteen specialty gardens,and the campus collections contain <br/>
many unusual plants for horticultural study.  The<br/>
natural areas include bogs, fens, gorges, meadows and woodlands, all <br/>
protected for research and education. The F. R. Newman Arboretum <br/>
includes maples, oaks, flowering trees, pines and other species in 150 <br/>
acres of a park-like setting. To ensure the health of the<br/>
plant collections, and to preserve them for generations<br/>
to come, please leash and clean up after your pets, and do not collect <br/>
or remove any flowers, fruits or plants. (information<br/>
taken from a brochure)<br/>
<br/>
                                 GETTING TO THE PLANTATIONS:<br/>
<br/>
Coming from the West by one of three route numbers (79,96 or 89), go <br/>
down a hill into Ithaca, and turn left onto Route 13<br/>
North. If you are coming from the East on Route 79, go down the hill, <br/>
and in Ithaca, turn right onto Route 13 North. Continue on Route 13 <br/>
North past the Cayuga Heights Exit and the Pyramid Mall Exit.<br/>
Continue to the stoplight where you will make a right turn onto Warren <br/>
Road.  Continue on that road for a mile.  At the<br/>
four-way stop, stay on Warren Road which will take you past a golf <br/>
course and down a steep hill to a stop sign where you turn left.  This <br/>
road winds across a one-way bridge; coming off the bridge, turn left <br/>
onto Forest Home Drive.  Proceed for six tenths of a mile along<br/>
the creek to the first parking area on the left where you can leave <br/>
your car.<br/>
<br/>
                                 Specific Clues:  Cross the road, and<br/>
enter through the gate.  Walking stright in at first, make the first <br/>
right. Walking stright you will come to the 1st path.  The path will <br/>
be on your right hand side. You will see an Umbrella Magnolia tree<br/>
to enter the path.  Go stright on the path and cross a bridge. <br/>
Continue on the path you will see a steep wooden staircase at the end <br/>
of the path.  Go to the top of the stairs.  Cross the road and<br/>
straight across you will see a clearing up the hill with a wooden <br/>
bench against a stone wall.  The Ralph T.<br/>
Reeve Bench.  Between 2 trees or 20 paces in back of the bench and on <br/>
the right you will find your path.  Take 37 Paces.  On the right you <br/>
will see your big rock and tree.  In between you will find me.<br/>
<br/>
Please e-mail me an let me know you found the box.  <br/>

my first box here.  A piece of me to leave behind.<br/>
<br/>

on the letterboxing.org website????<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
