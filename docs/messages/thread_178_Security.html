&gt;  ...if nature's forces washed them away (2 out of the 3<br/>
&gt;  missing ones are completely gone--left no trace or trash to indicate they<br/>
&gt;  ever existed) it would be a really bad idea to put them back to have that<br/>
&gt;  happen again.<br/>
<br/>
How can you find out if that's what happened?  It would take a big rain to <br/>
do that, wouldn't it?  Did you have a big rain then (after you last checked)?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  ...I'm thinking I'll be putting my e-mail address up instead of clues...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Your thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Here are my thoughts:  There may be a better way.  Email addresses are<br/>
traceable, just like phone numbers.  We're an open group.  I assume we want<br/>
people to participate who are also open.<br/>
<br/>
Do any of you have caller ID on your phones?<br/>
<br/>
I have caller ID so I can see who's calling my house.  And I DO NOT block<br/>
my ID from other people.  Other people can see who I am when I call their<br/>
houses.  To me this ensures openess -- at least to the extent that other<br/>
people ID themselves to me, then it is open BOTH ways.  If they ID<br/>
themselves then I see that and I don't have to pick up if its somebody I<br/>
know is mean or irritating.  I don't like anonymous calls too much either<br/>
and sometimes I don't pick them up either because often they are unwanted<br/>
solicitations or people I don't like.  Really, my best friends are the kind<br/>
of people DON'T prevent their ID from going out.  So its really nice to<br/>
have people like that.  And its also nice to not have to answer the anonymous<br/>
calls.  But sometimes the ID box will say something like, "Outside of area"<br/>
and I guess that means they don't have the ID service available in their<br/>
area.  Those calls I pick up automatically because its not their fault that<br/>
they can't provide an ID.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, maybe letterboxing should work the same way.  Our letterboxes are<br/>
not now secretive or obscure.  They may be a bit clever/intuitive but they<br/>
are out there for anyone to see &amp; use.  But why would we invite people to<br/>
look at our clues who themselves would be secretive or obscure?  If people<br/>
participate they should be open.  They should ID themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Using an email request to divulge your clues is the same thing really.  You <br/>
are forcing the person to let you know who they are.  But wouldn't it be nice<br/>
if we can accomplish that same thing (to be both open AND secure) without<br/>
having to send out special clues by email?  I will support you if you <br/>
want to try it that way, but I wonder if we should try it the other way too.<br/>
That may come closer and work better for what you want.  It certainly would<br/>
be simpler and easier to use.<br/>
<br/>
I think (if its available) we should install a feature on our site so that<br/>
people can't sneak about to get our clues from the web.  Eventually, if<br/>
someone does sneak about and uses that info to steal boxes they will get<br/>
caught because the record will show their pattern.  But a service like this<br/>
will make people less likely to steal in the first place because they will<br/>
know that there is a record being made.<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering if this appeals to Adrian or other of our British friends who<br/>
may have run into theft problems that could not be dealt with any other way.  <br/>
<br/>
If I understand Randy correctly the ID of those accessing our clues can be<br/>
gotten if I ask the internet service provider to set it up (if the ISP<br/>
offers the service that is).  I don't know if my ISP offers that service but<br/>
I can find out.<br/>
<br/>
Comments if any you have please...<br/>
<br/>
These are just my thoughts.  But I think this may be an important issue for<br/>
the long-term.  Its a relavent security issue that we should address now and<br/>
try to eliminate the speculation about causes.  If we install a service like<br/>
this we will be able to discern with a fair anount of certainty if the web<br/>
is being used for theft or vandalism.  It seems that that is what we need to<br/>
know in order to settle this issue.  If somebody has other ideas please <br/>
share them.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
