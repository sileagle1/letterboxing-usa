Perhaps I should be posting this on the postal letterbox list, but I<br/>
thought I might receive a wider audience here.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the basic concept of a postal letterbox ring (all those<br/>
who sign up create a letterbox within a theme then send them on to the<br/>
next person on a list, receiving as many boxes as there are people in<br/>
the ring)<br/>
<br/>
I am VERY pregnant right now and due to have a baby in a month, plus<br/>
we have 3 feet of snow on the ground, so I thought joining one of<br/>
these rings might satiate my need to carve and letterbox in general<br/>
until I am able to get out and about again this spring. <br/>
<br/>
I can't seem to get on any lists, so I was thinking of starting my own<br/>
ring. Is there more I need to know about how to administer a ring,<br/>
where to start it and manage it (Atlasquest?) and or tips to make a<br/>
ring fun and successful (ie the max number of people to include, time<br/>
limits etc)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input!<br/>
<br/>

Hi Lisa,<br/>
<br/>
You definately should post this to the postal LB talk group.  I <br/>
think people there will give you lots of good advice.  As far as <br/>
joining a ring, there seems to be a new ring forming every week or <br/>
so.  most are posted on the PLB talk group.  I have one ring that I <br/>
started and I belong to 5 other rings.  Here is my personal <br/>
preference on some of the questions you asked.  There is no right or <br/>
wrong answer just preference.<br/>
<br/>
When I started my ring I made all the requirements of the ring known <br/>
right up from (ex. start date, hand carved stamp, if priority mail <br/>
or delivery conf. are required, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I prefer creating a new, separate Yahoo talk group just for ring <br/>
participants.  This creates a sense of community and people don't <br/>
have to search through the entire postal talk list to find out <br/>
what's been going on in the ring.  I have never tracked using Atlas <br/>
Quest.  I belong to a ring that uses AQ to track and I prefer a <br/>
separate Yahoo talk list that all ring participants should belong to.<br/>
<br/>
I set the ring start date far enough in advance that everyone should <br/>
be able to comply.  I remind people periodically that the date is <br/>
coming near and confirm that people still are on track to mail on <br/>
that date.<br/>
<br/>
I create my own excell spread sheet to track each boxes progress.  <br/>
If a box is not heard from, I check with people to see why.<br/>
<br/>
I think a good number of people for a ring is 15 - 20.  Too few and <br/>
you don't get your hard worked on creation to enough people.  TO <br/>
many and it becomes hard to manage and will take a long time.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.  Good luck with your postal ring &amp; your new baby.<br/>
<br/>

PS I do not read this talk list often.  If you need to contact me <br/>
you can at moonstone_baby at yahoo dot com.  I would have replied to <br/>
you off list but I do not get individual emails so could not see <br/>
your email address.<br/>
