Hi<br/>
I was in Camp Saratoga today in Wilton NY and seen a box that said <br/>
this had been picked up and was going to new parts unknown. I am REAL <br/>
new to letterboxing and did not look at it to clostly as I did not <br/>
know that much about it.I will go back soon to see if there was <br/>
anything else written in the log book.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

It had been all over and had only two pages left in the log before it was to be sent home.  It turns out I was the first person to contact them with an update since it had been released three years ago!.  They had considered it long gone.  I hope you find that your H.H. is still truckin' and if anyone out there runs across the I'd Rather be Mad H.H. please keep it moving to fill in those last two pages and send it home!<br/>
<br/>
  Happy trails all you little H.H.'s out there!<br/>
