                    <div class="plaintext-content">in the OBX (and you all thought I was going to say "upon the wings of <br/>
loooooovvvvveeee..."  Sorry -- I only sing old songs out loud and off key to <br/>
drive my kids nuts -- we had a whole "shake your booty" discussion in the <br/>
car just this morning as a matter of a fact...)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway -- we wanted to report that we had a glorious time locating the <br/>
Flying High in the OBX box.  It is at a wonderful sight that I cannot <br/>
believe we have vacationed right by and not visited for the past 6 years!  <br/>
Shame on us!  The kids had a fantastic time flying down the walkway, trying <br/>
to pass the landing markers in faster times than the original siblings (not <br/>
too hard to do ...  they must have had quite a headwind originally!)  All I <br/>
can say is if Be had run that fast at school - he would have earned the <br/>
presidential fitness award for sure!  Na and Da followed at a slightly <br/>
slower pace, apologizing to all the tourists and helping to pull them back <br/>
to their feet...  We found the box (and it's HH companion) just where the <br/>
fifth flight would be.  A word of caution -- while the kids merrily stamped <br/>
in, Mom sat on the pedestal and tried to pull prickly pear cactus thorns out <br/>
of her sandal clad feet.  Those buggers are small, but their spines are long <br/>
and you have to give em quite a tug to get them out -- ouch!  Wear smarter <br/>
shoes!<br/>
<br/>
After Da (in docksiders) chivalrously replanted the box, Be and Ma ran back <br/>
down the walkway.  When we caught up with them, Ma was explaining the whole <br/>
memorial to a kind looking elderly couple....<br/>
<br/>
We went inside and listened to a ranger for a bit and then walked around the <br/>
exhibits trying to earn our junior ranger badges.  Needless to say, the kids <br/>
lost interest pretty fast but Mom held on.  I'm sure I was quite a sight <br/>
with my two sets of Jr. Ranger quizzes (color coded yellow for the eight <br/>
year old and under crowd)....Oh well, maybe next year...<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards we went over to Jockey's Ridge which is really cool.  It's a huge <br/>
sand dune and once on it, you feel like you're in the middle of the desert.  <br/>
You should see the video I mistakenly took with my camera while walking back <br/>
down "scenes of very dusty feet clad in highly inappropriate letterboxing <br/>
sandals....sounds of huffing and puffing with occasional warning remarks to <br/>
youngsters bobbing up ahead..."  Finding Nemo has nothing to worry about....<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Nemo, we had planned to go see the movie during one of the <br/>
multiple days forecasted for storms and cold, but, the weather was <br/>
gorgeous!!  Not a rain drop in sight!  Guess I brought the flannel nighties, <br/>
wind breakers, and sweatshirts for nothing!  Of course, appropriately <br/>
enough, on the way home, less than an hour after crossing the state line <br/>
into Virginia, it started to pour!!  Wouldn't ya know it?!  BeMa<br/>

appears.  Sounds like a great vacation. <br/>
     I've been doing a ton of boxing. Wish I could count them, but <br/>
alas, it's for our move this weekend. <br/>
     Princess Turtle and I have made 6 trips with boxes to the new <br/>
house and the ones left behind seem to be multiplying like rabbits <br/>
while we are gone. The real bummer is every time we make a trip I <br/>
drive by 5 of our boxes. I'm itching to check them out to see if they <br/>
haven't taken off on an unscheduled excursion down the Chesapeake Bay.<br/>
D%#* this rain!!!!!<br/>
