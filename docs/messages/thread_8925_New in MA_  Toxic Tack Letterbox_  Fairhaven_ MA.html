some new letterboxes.  Here is the first.<br/>
<br/>
TOXIC TACK LETTERBOX: Bristol County, MA<br/>
<br/>
Placed on October 13, 2002 by The Yachtsman and Mary Manatee<br/>
<br/>
"The Atlas Tack facility was built in 1901 and operated as a <br/>
manufacturer of tacks, steel nails, rivets, and bolts until 1985. The <br/>
facility's operation included electroplating, acid-washing,<br/>
enameling, and painting. From the early 1940's to the 1970's, process <br/>
wastes containing acids, heavy metals such as copper and zinc, and <br/>
solvents were discharged into drains in the floor of the main <br/>
building. It is believed that wastewater from these operations was <br/>
discharged to an on-site lagoon from approximately 1940 through 1973. <br/>
As a result of these practices, many of these chemicals have permeated <br/>
into the soil and groundwater."  This is a quotation from an EPA press <br/>
release in 1999 (www.epa.gov/region1/pr/1999/110899.html) that <br/>
announced the beginning of the cleanup of this superfund site. The <br/>
first phase of the cleanup involved removal of friable asbestos from <br/>
partially collapsed buildings that had not been maintained since the <br/>
company's demise in 1985.  Ground and water cleanup have not been <br/>
completed because of monetary issues.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The former Atlas Tack site can be reached along the Phoenix Bike <br/>
Trail, about  mile from the Western end.  Take Route 195 to exit<br/>
18 in Fairhaven.  Take Rt 240 south to traffic light.  Bear right at <br/>
light, and go straight through next intersection (Alden Rd).  At<br/>
Route 6, turn right (West) and proceed to Adam St.  Turn left, and go <br/>
to end of street.  Park on you left in small dirt area off the road <br/>
just in front of the bike path.  You will be across the street from <br/>
Doug's Prop Shop.  (If there is no parking here, turn right, and park <br/>
in the driveway in front of one of the remaining Atlas Tack buildings <br/>
on Pleasant St.)  <br/>
<br/>
Enter the bike path and proceed East past Z &amp; W's Welding and <br/>
Fabrication and Borges &amp; Son Excavating &amp; Building on your left<br/>
behind a chain link fence.  Soon you will be passing the fenced in <br/>
property of what remains of Atlas Tack. This site is a good reminder <br/>
of what can happen to Mother Nature if environmentalists do not remain <br/>
vigilant.  Although some of the buildings have been torn down,<br/>
several large brick hulks remain, as well as a very noticeable <br/>
landmark, their tall smokestack.  <br/>
<br/>
As you pass through the "S turn" on the bike path you will soon pass <br/>
the home of the Fairhaven Honey Wagon on your left.  Soon afterward, <br/>
you will approach an intersection with an orange metal gate.  Turn <br/>
south onto the dirt road and proceed up the hill to the top of what<br/>
is the extension of the hurricane barrier.  As you stand in the center<br/>
of the intersection of the barrier with the road, Buzzards Bay will be<br/>
to your south, and the Atlas Tack smokestack will be at 270O.  Walk<br/>
about 15 paces to a 15 - 20 foot juniper at 325O.  With your back to <br/>
the juniper as you face toward the water, there will be a sentinel <br/>
rock on your right.  At the base of the sentinel is a small black <br/>
boulder that hides the access to your treasure.  After stamping in, <br/>
reflect on how beautiful this site on the marsh can be when the <br/>
cleanup is actually completed.<br/>
