to "Dan" aka "Preach" of "Teach and Preach" for all he has done for<br/>
letterboxing . He recently had back Surgery and will be off the trails<br/>
for awhile. This H.H. will do his traveling for him.  "DAN THE MAN" <br/>
was started on his travels by The NEEDEEPS, and sent to me to take to<br/>
lunch at the INN at THE BEGINNING.  Such a beautiful day today and a<br/>
nice 'lunch' at the INN. and DAN the MAN will be on his way .  Lets<br/>
keep him traveling. Thanks NEEDEEPS for trusting him to me for lunch!!<br/>
