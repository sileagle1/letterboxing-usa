<br/>
Putting together pieces of info from the logbooks of the Letterbox <br/>
and your HH, we have put together the following scenario as to what <br/>
happened to it... <br/>
<br/>
The HH assumed a normal pathway up in CT in mid May 2003 (heavy <br/>
action, probably a gathering of some sort; timing was for the Gerbil<br/>
Gather). In July 2003, Laura and ??? moved it to NJ and placed it <br/>
there.<br/>
It was found along with the letterboxer by some muggles and they took <br/>
the stamp for the HH because thought it was cool.  This was in 2004<br/>
At that time the logbook of the regular box filled up and people began<br/>
using the HH logbook as the letterbox logbook. The muggles were the <br/>
last<br/>
entry on the regular LB's logbook. <br/>
<br/>
So, we transferred pages from the HH log to the regular LB log and <br/>
added some more pages to that for the regular log. I brought the HH <br/>
logbook, baggy and container home and now they sit in my garage. <br/>
<br/>
Would anybody be able to offer some advice regarding this HH?<br/>

I sometimes think about releasing an HH into the wild but then stop myself because I worry that HHs are confusing. The other reason I don't release an HH - it can be difficult to find a big enough letterbox in which to place an HH and its logbook. This story illustrates the confusion that can occur. Having said that, I still like finding them, especially now that I know what they are and how to handle them. Thanks for sharing this hitchhiker's history.<br/>
<br/>
I checked the Hitchhiker database: http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/pageH.html#letterH and this HH may be Mark &amp; Sue Pepe's. Here's a link to their blog which has contact info: http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/pageH.html#letterH<br/>
But maybe they were the first to put in the Hitchhiker database. The database says they dropped it off at the Gerbil Gathering on May 17 2003. <br/>

was not their's.  Mark also suggested posting on the Traveler board <br/>
and I am going to check for nibbles there.<br/>
<br/>
It was one of those Mega-HH's which are as large as big letterboxers, <br/>
complete with its own container.<br/>
<br/>
I've done some further investigating and I think I have determined <br/>
the creator.  Hopefully, we shall be able to determine the path <br/>
forward.<br/>
