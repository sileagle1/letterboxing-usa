hitched to letterboxes as far as Canada!  It was found on the top of Mt. Jo in <br/>
the Adirondacks, and the person who had found it had thought it was trash.  <br/>
The following is a letter which accompanied the package:<br/>

To Music Woman:<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for having started the Troubadour on his route and helping him <br/>
continue.  I knew nothing about letterboxing and when I came across the bag <br/>
in the woods on top of Mt. Jo Adirondacks I thought it was trash.  At fifty <br/>
years old, I now am looking forward to looking for other locations while hiking.  <br/>
Thanks very much for the introduction to this great pastime.<br/>
<br/>

I guess we have a new recruit!  The Troubadour will now be sent via postal <br/>
mail somewhere in the USA so it can continue it's voyage.  Be sure to check your <br/>
mailboxes often!  If you do get the Troubadour in the mail, drop him off at <br/>
the next letterbox you visit, and be sure to keep me apprised of his progress!<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>
