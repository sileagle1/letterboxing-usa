Dear LbNA folk<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if an old Brit Wizard can have a few cents worth about members<br/>
and attaches and viruses and wierdo emails etc too ?<br/>
<br/>
I read LbNA every day and have always read her lists and read both her<br/>
older sisters lists via my University off line reader.<br/>
<br/>
I don't see HTML at all !<br/>
<br/>
Everything I get is an attach !<br/>
<br/>
(That is everything !)<br/>
<br/>
I have always been a joined member, it's the only way I can see anything !<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we are a bit odd in Britain..but our phone costs are so much higher<br/>
that web-browsing is costly...<br/>
<br/>
OK so I represent less than 0.0001% of readers...but I don't see it being<br/>
a big deal whether to attach or join ?<br/>
<br/>
I guess we are all different but I can't see what the problemo is all<br/>
about ....<br/>
<br/>
I get around 300 emails a day .. and maybe 3 or 4  weirdo's a week..You<br/>
know the sort of stuff  "Buy our magic paint and never decorate again !"<br/>
and "Get Qualified as a snail taxidermist and make $1,000,000 by next<br/>
Tuesday"...<br/>
<br/>
As to viruses..well I've been on line since something called ARPANET first<br/>
began..and that makes me a "grey-beard" believe it !  I have seen three<br/>
viruses..including the legendary AIDS (the computer virus not the illness<br/>
I mean) which was the only one to do any damage that I personally saw on a<br/>
PC!...and you actually had to load a file from a floppy disc to get that<br/>
one !  It came by mail not email !!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I am lucky !<br/>
<br/>
Maybe its about just ignoring the bad guys and getting to grips with basic<br/>
stuff...and as someone said XP makes us all techno-wizards anyway !  But<br/>
surely anyone should be able to play ?  It's a new place here, (internet<br/>
land), and I vote for any access all the time and for all kinds of folk.. <br/>
Bad guys will always be able to do bad stuff..that's their only way to<br/>
exist (sadly) but we shouldn't live counting on their views imho !  They<br/>
represent even a lower head count than my humble 0.0001% I believe !  I<br/>
don't think we can fix all the leaks in every boat so shouldn't waste our<br/>
time trying ! Let's just enjoy letterboxing instead...<br/>
<br/>
So my vote is for internet freedom..Any access is OK and the weirdos and<br/>
other stuff is just a very tiny tiny noise !<br/>
<br/>
Open is cool imho..see my email address <g><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keep the Internet Free (Please)<br/>
<br/>
It's very hard to go back once you start burning bridges !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Just one vh opinion...in good faith)<br/>
