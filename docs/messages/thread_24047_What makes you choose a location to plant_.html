Gwen and I usually like to take you to a pretty waterfall, park,or <br/>
some other place with what we think is a cool feature. That is not to <br/>
say we have planted some really weird drivebys that may not be <br/>
particularly wonderful.<br/>
Our "45 at 101" in Oregon certainly falls into the 'different' <br/>
category, but it does have a good stamp. Our "Seal Beach Town Tour" <br/>
isn't at one neat spot, but a tour of a seaside town in Orange Co. Ca. <br/>
is worth the time to do some plaque decoding.<br/>
<br/>
When we hit the road for the summer I will precarve several stamps for <br/>
the locations we are heading, but some of the best stamps are carved <br/>
on the spot. One of my all time favorites is "McKensies Head" in SW <br/>
Washinton and that was generated on the spot due to the location.<br/>

<br/>
I chose the site because it's my favorite place to walk the dog. I love coming back here and wanted another excuse to visit frequently. I scouted out my locations first. I had to make sure that they were far enough away from a geocache that's planted in the area.  Once I found my spots I had a good idea about what size container I'd need. The stamp images were inspired by the locations I chose. I carved up the stamps last night and finished the logbooks and camoflaguing the containers this morning then went out to plant this afternoon. All went well and the containers fit, phew. One of the boxes is very winter-friendly, a quick easy box that's off the ground so snow shouldn't be a problem. It's almost a drive-by, so LBers won't have to be out in the cold for very long.<br/>

FWIW, (as a relatively "new-kid-on-the-block", P4), I've used both <br/>
methods: 1. "Idea for a stamp!", then find a plant site, and 2. "I have <br/>
this special place" ('go-to-your-happy-place!-go-to-your-happy-place!-<br/>
go...'), and design a stamp to place there! :p<br/>
IMHO, do what strikes you as best for the idea that springs to mind.  <br/>
Plant and they will come--don't over-think it.<br/>

&gt; I was just wondering what your thought process was regarding planting<br/>
&gt; boxes. What comes first? Designing the stamp or choosing the<br/>
&gt; location? Do you choose a location that has some meaning in your life<br/>
&gt; or is a pretty hike? Most of the boxes that I am preparing are<br/>
&gt; meaningfuul places/times in my life to me. I was just wondering how<br/>
&gt; other people did it.<br/>

Could be worse.  Could have found the Klingon word for another part of <br/>
your anatomy to call "big" =O<br/>
