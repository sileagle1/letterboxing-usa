Evergreen series. Great hike! One of our new favorites actually!  We <br/>
provided a little maintanence on some of Jay's boxes as far as <br/>
replacing ripped baggies and damp paper towels.  All the log books <br/>
in all 6 boxes are full/near full and we're having to stamp on the <br/>
flip side of pages.... so if you owners havetime to place #2 books, <br/>
It would be a good idea!<br/>
<br/>
We tried to go do all the DPNC boxes and arbitrarily picked the DPNC <br/>
#2 series to start with. LONG hike but incredible stamps!!!!   Use <br/>
caution if you choose to try these, as 1) there are 2 places to turn <br/>
left onto the white trail from the red trail's long loop.... and 2) <br/>
the yellow trail going to the power lines, along with the orange <br/>
coming back from the powerlins are now WHITE!   Rumor is there's a <br/>
new map being printed and it should be up soon, but definately get a <br/>
map at the Nature center and USE it! <br/>
<br/>
We finished the series at 6:30 and did not have the gusto to even <br/>
think about the DPNC #1 series or Judi's boxes in that area. Also <br/>
wanted to go to Captain's Walk but we were toooo tired. Probably did <br/>
~ 6 miles today, so the hot tub got some use after dinner!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Melissa and Dan, The Drews, and the Kurdziel's for great <br/>
spots!<br/>
