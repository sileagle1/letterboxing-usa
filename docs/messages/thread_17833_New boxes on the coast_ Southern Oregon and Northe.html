I'm a newbie planter.  I just stuck two boxes out there, and might <br/>
well do another tomorrow.  Not much of a carver, yet, though I am <br/>
happy with my signature stamp and looking forward to using it a few <br/>
times tomorrow.  Check out the Damnation Creek letterbox and the <br/>
Indian Sands letterbox.  These trails are not well traveled, at <br/>
somewhat hard to find locations, though the letterboxes themselves <br/>
should not be that hard to find, if they stay in place.  Please e-<br/>
mail me with any info on the boxes you wish; critiques, compliments <br/>
or concerns.  I live in Portland Oregon, and will not be down very <br/>
often to check on my babies.  They are not so much orphans, more <br/>
like redheaded step-children???  :)  I hope you enjoy some of my <br/>
favorite places.  Please treat the land with respect, and expect <br/>
your heart rate to increase as you return from your letterboxing <br/>
adventures!<br/>
Cheers<br/>
