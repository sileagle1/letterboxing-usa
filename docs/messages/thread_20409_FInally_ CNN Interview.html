<br/>
Well, I finally got my CNN interview from the producer. It was too big to host on my <br/>
geocities site. So, the IT guys at work were kind enough to post<br/>
it on my work website for a week or so. Plz check it out and let me know what you think<br/>
of it. You can just e-mail me offlist to save some traffic on the main list. I cross-posted <br/>
this on the SE list, sorry. Just wanted to share. <br/>

CNN huh? They didn't play up the history or authenticity of the hobby much, that to <br/>

So, in my opinion - the short skit was pretty watered down.<br/>
Due to the history and natural landscape of some areas in Maine, I would never <br/>
consider doing something like that. I've pulled most of my accessible clues off the <br/>

easy to accomplish being as how I'm all the way up here.<br/>
<br/>
The true test remains to be seen - if the hobby can stand the test of time, tv, media <br/>

competing hobby with geocaching, and sometimes I think it has the potential. <br/>

minutes long and I went through the history, the leave no trace, the<br/>
point of seeing natural beauty, etc. They chose to use what the used.<br/>
It was not for lack of me speaking of it. And since it was my box I<br/>
"found" for the skit, I felt I could show the logbook if I wanted to.<br/>
It was, afterall, my logbook and my box's logbook. <br/>
Thanks for your comments though,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey ... wow ... nice logbook!  It's fantastic that the stamp images <br/>
you've taken are so colorful.  Are those Crayola markers you are <br/>
using?<br/>
<br/>
When you find a box, do you decide what colors to make the stamp and <br/>
then color different sections for your logbook?<br/>
<br/>
I've found that the stamp part of this hobby is the part I enjoy <br/>
least ... I have a hard time getting a clean image, inks can be messy <br/>
(especially when they are dye inks in a waterlogged box) and I'm poor <br/>
at carving.  I've been thinking of switching to carrying a bunch of <br/>
cat's eye stamps and stamping using the colors I want rather than the <br/>
ink pad that's in the box ... a collection of markers might be better.<br/>
<br/>
So, Mark, tell me ... how do you "log" stamps?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
