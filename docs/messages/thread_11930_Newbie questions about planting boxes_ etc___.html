                    <div class="plaintext-content">Got our second box today here in So Cal... it was Terre et Eau in Costa Mesa. <br/>
 Lots of fun, and doable even with a stroller (although very rough in parts).<br/>
<br/>
We are thinking about planting some new boxes near our home in Chatsworth, <br/>
but had a few questions.  First of all, how close together can boxes be?  I <br/>
know there are some series, but how many in how big an area?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, if we take our cross country trip, is it OK to plant boxes that you may <br/>
not get back to check on soon... perhaps never?  We were thinking about <br/>
planting a couple in the few and infrequent rest stops across the vast <br/>
Arizona desert.<br/>
<br/>
What do the abbreviations x and v stand for (as in the p1, f39, x47, v4 post <br/>
earlier)?<br/>
<br/>
How do hitch-hikers work?  Are they just stamps, full boxes, stamps and books <br/>
together?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!  We're having a great time getting to know this new world!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Kay, you should try Terre et Eau after a rain. Gwen and I had several inches of mud and couldn't go by the bike jumps. How close can boxes be planted ? There are no rules !   Our Summer Storms box in Ariz. is an orphan as are some of our other boxes since  we have moved. Many of Amanda's, Ryan's and other folks plant them across the country and they become orphans . HHers can be a stamp, book in a zip lok placed along with another LB or it can be a stamp, book, zip lok inside a Tupperware. You can also include stamp pads, pre paid postcards particularly if you want to track some travels. As far as the P, F, X, V, L,C listings I'll let someone else jump in as I tend to be a non counter. About a year ago I put the C listing up on a post as a joke and it got picked up and it then got a life of it's own. Don<br/>
