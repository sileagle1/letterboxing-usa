Click Canada on LBNA Map-- should direct you to any-- I tried the one <br/>
on Mount Royal--but it was missing when I went there 1 year ago-- I <br/>
contacted the placer, and I think she said she was going to replace <br/>
it--not sure.<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>

the box O'Canada on Mount Royal was retired and I was all excited to <br/>
plant a box there....however.. the park was SO crowded and "well <br/>
traveled" that I changed my mind. After all, it is a city park. There <br/>
are a few (3?)boxes listed outside of Montreal but I just didn't get <br/>
the chance to drive out to them. Also there are several boxes just on <br/>
the US side of the Canadian border if you happen to be driving.. Have <br/>
Fun! ... <br/>
oooh wait, I hope it's not a work trip? Kstar<br/>

Work trip?  Since when did that stop any of us?  I have gone <br/>
letterboxing in a business dress suit and heels several times <br/>
now.  All for the sake of another letterbox . . . :-)<br/>
