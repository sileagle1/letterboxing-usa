HI everyone,<br/>
I'm 19 going on 20, but count me in. My mom and her friend and I love<br/>
letterboxing. Sometimes my fiance comes along. <br/>
<br/>
Also have another request to anyne who has placed letterboxes in eastern<br/>
CT. I'm making a website for a college internet class, it's all about<br/>
letterboxing. I think it's coming out really well. I hope I don't step<br/>
on anyones toes the Letterboxing .org is a great site. I just wanted to<br/>
localize it. I've been working on the research since October, and have<br/>
been working on the actual site for a few weeks. The problem is that I<br/>
don't want to duplicate anyones clues without their permission, that's<br/>
plagerism and my prof. would have a cow. <br/>
<br/>
Future plans for the site include a road map with a mark placed<br/>
hopefully in the parking lot, helping people find their way easier. <br/>
<br/>
Also I've written a page for missing letterboxes, links to related<br/>
sites, (including letterboxong.org), and a FAQ page.  <br/>
<br/>
Please e-mail me and let me know which boxes that you've planted that I<br/>
can and can't use on the site. I'll place the e-mail in my portfolio for<br/>
school. Thanks for putting so much out there, I know that I'll never<br/>
finish, but I'm taking internet 2 in the spring.<br/>
Thanks again, Debbie<br/>

old and very new to this hobby but it's really fun. I love hiking for a<br/>
reason, not just for fun, plus it gives you plenty of exercise. I'm doing<br/>
this Project for Girl Scouts where I'm putting some letterboxes out in and<br/>
near my home town, Cheshire. When I put them out I'll tell you all about it<br/>
but I don't know how to write the letters on the list. If anyone knows how,<br/>
please tell me and I'll give you the instructions as soon as I make them and<br/>
put the box there. This is for an Award that's called the Silver Award. Its<br/>
for girl scouts, well bye and thanks<br/>

    We were at the Grist in the Mist letterbox this afternoon.  We saw your<br/>
note that you beat us to it :)  We will have to be quicker next time.<br/>
Unfortunately Mansfield is not too close to home.  Just wanted to let you<br/>
know that our boxes are: Arboretum Adventure, Rock Springs, and Curious<br/>
George and the Giant's Chair.  Feel free to use any of these on your web<br/>
site.  Good luck!  Can't wait to see how it turns out.<br/>
