<br/>
Nice to see you on the list...I am still lurking !<br/>
<br/>
And despite predictions to the contrary <g> I am here still..though snowed<br/>
under with marking assignments and stuff !<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I too keep a logbook with lots of little notes in additin to the stampe<br/>
&gt;images I find in the boxes. In England, most letterboxers use cards to<br/>
&gt;collect their stamped images. The take severla imressins of the stamp.<br/>
&gt;That way if they mess up the first time, they can do it over. The cards<br/>
&gt;are easier to handle than a book. They can re arrange the stamps anyway<br/>
&gt;they like: alphabetical, by date, by geographic location, etc. <br/>
<br/>
It is true we do Brits use "post card" type records to "collect" stamp<br/>
impressions .. this looks good in those photo albums where you slot in 5 x<br/>
3 pix into plastic pockets.  We use a kind of filing box which makes<br/>
carrying and processing cards easy when stomping on the moor..a sort of<br/>
double box...unused cards on top, stamped treasures inside ...I'll try and<br/>
photo mine and send you a picture.<br/>
<br/>
For display and storage you can get 100 and 200 slot albums cheaply..and<br/>
as we get sew on patches for these 100/200/300/ etc up to 5000 they are<br/>
easy to wield as "proof" when claiming your patches !  Also if you are<br/>
collecting a series and miss one..you can slot it back in place when you<br/>
find it later !  Some folk make up wall posters and stuff..very nice to<br/>
see a big collection on display !<br/>
<br/>
But most letterboxers do also carry a log book as a chronological walk<br/>
record.  Most folk put all sorts of stuff in, like the clues and notes<br/>
about the location and weather. Even pressed flowers ! And comments about<br/>
how you found the box or just what a nice day it was !<br/>
<br/>
These comments are of course often written into the Visitors Books too !.<br/>
Similarly I often copy back good things other folk have written themselves<br/>
in the Visitor's Books <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My log book ?<br/>
<br/>
Well I have had many..but at the moment I have a "real prize collectors<br/>
book"...it's a nice big orange one with "Space Travellers" stamp in the<br/>
front !<br/>
<br/>
But with one thing and another I have not been on the moor in 2001 YET !<br/>
<br/>
So it awaits its first foray !<br/>
