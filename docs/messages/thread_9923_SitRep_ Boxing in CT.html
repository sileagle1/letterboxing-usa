                    <div class="plaintext-content">TeamGreenDragon spent Sunday in beautiful Mansfield CT and found the <br/>
following boxes in great shape. #2 (Monarch) &amp; #3 (Lunar) in the Mt. <br/>
Hope series. We'll be going back for the other two when the snow <br/>
melts. We then moved on to search for the "Three Wizards" series at <br/>
the Merrow Meadows Park and found all three of these (#3 "Harry <br/>
Potter" was our 100th find). We also found the "Merrow Park" box <br/>
(This one has quit a bit of history in its Logbook). We ended our day <br/>
with the "Thank You" box. Witch is how I shall end this post, By <br/>
saying "Thank You" to all the great "Boxers" in our area. Hope to <br/>
personally thank you at the MA gathering on the 18th.  <br/>

I've got about ten stamps carved and ready for planting ) is this <br/>
ever going to end ?<br/>

Hey Team Green Dragon , Thanks for coming down yes there has been a <br/>
reading off report on that box I've been meaning to check it and <br/>
repost. Others have found it though. There are others right near <br/>
there you will want to go back for anyway. Revolutiionary Women, <br/>
Grandson of Charter Oak, my add on to the Rev. Women Red bird@ <br/>
Truman's meadow , Skungamaug,  so glad you got the Got Milk it will <br/>
be buried in snow for quite a while now!  Neat you found some <br/>
generous souls who shared the location of KJ's best it has been very <br/>
popular and is the second box there. The first was pinched but they <br/>
called and asked for another it was so popular.  When you come back <br/>
let me know we could meet up and do a couple together. carol - Leader <br/>

&gt; Sunday we boxed in the Mansfield CT <br/>
&gt; &gt; area and found the following boxes all intact and<br/>
&gt; in place. "Son of <br/>
&gt; &gt; Uncle Sam" (We where unable to locate "Stars and<br/>

<br/>
The compass bearings are badly off for that box, but<br/>
if you read the clues and pay attention when you drive<br/>
in, you can find it through a process of elimination.<br/>
Good luck. :-)<br/>
