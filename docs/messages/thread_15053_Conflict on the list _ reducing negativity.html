                    <div class="plaintext-content">Randy, thank you very much for your words of wisdom.  I think they <br/>
carry a huge amount of weight and it is nice to hear your views.<br/>
<br/>
To the general list - <br/>
<br/>
I spent about an hour this morning reading posts starting with #1 and <br/>
getting up to about #500 or so.  Please please please keep in mind <br/>
that conflict has been part of this list since its inception in <br/>
1998.  Reading some of the words from Der mad Stamper, Randy, Erik <br/>
the viking, et al may be good medicine for everyone. It certainly <br/>
grounds you to how the pasttime has evolved.  Rather than filter <br/>
through the flames -- take a few minutes to read how conflicts were <br/>
resolved 5 years ago and learn from it. <br/>
<br/>
We entirely feel that each opinion be weighted the same without <br/>
regard for your PFX number. I would encourage new subscribers <br/>
and "older" subscribers to not make a knee-jerk reaction to someones <br/>
words; words are impossible to retract so choose them wisely and <br/>
rememeber that the tone/mood of an email a function of how you use <br/>
those words. <br/>
<br/>
As for the database, We think that the poll is not a cut and dry <br/>
keep/eliminate function based on a vote. Its more of a good way to <br/>
feel out the general consensus of the database idea -- right now its <br/>
almost dead even. <br/>
<br/>
Please remember that this big list is entirely about respect. Respect <br/>
for opinions, boxes, and most importantly the recreation and <br/>
catharsis that this bring to many of us just looking to go enjoy the <br/>
great outdoors! <br/>
<br/>
