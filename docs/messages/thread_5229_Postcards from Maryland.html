to check on them. So getting news from their visitors is wonderful! In the <br/>
past two weeks I have recieved three postcards from boxes in Maryland that I <br/>
planted on past trips down. It is such a pleasure to meet new 'boxers and to <br/>
see new personal stamps. Putting self adressed stamped post cards in my <br/>
boxes has been a real plus! Thanks to all those who take the time to write a <br/>
note, stamp their "stamp" on the card and mail it off!!<br/>
Enjoy Life! 'Box On!<br/>
