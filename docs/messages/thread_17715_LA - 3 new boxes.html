Everyone says if you plant them, they will come.  So far, only <br/>
Silver Eagle has come.  Boo-hoo...<br/>
<br/>
Steve and Jim from La. - I've got 6 planted now!  Is that enough to <br/>
justify a trip up here???  I hope to get at least 3 more in place <br/>
next weekend, so start making plans for a visit to B.R.  And bring <br/>
some boxes to plant here so I'll have something to find. <grin><br/>
<br/>
I introduced a friend to letterboxing this weekend and she already <br/>
has twice as many finds as me...<br/>
<br/>

I'm trying to recruit a boxing-buddy first so it will be more fun.  <br/>
I was also thinking the proposed mini-meet might be down that way <br/>
and I would just wait until then.<br/>
