A pair of letterboxes on a town-sponsored masterpiece overlooking the <br/>
incredible Thimble Islands in Branford, CT. This hike covers an easy <br/>
shoreside 1.5 miles with a small climb and an option for a fine <br/>
stroll into a divine village for Sunday cappuccino.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: On I95 in Branford, take exit 56 and head south 1.4 miles <br/>
on Leetes Island Road towards Stony Creek. Turn right on Rte. 146 for <br/>
1.2 miles, where the road makes a double-left towards Pine Orchard. <br/>
These two beach communities used to be connected by a trolley, now <br/>
converted to a splendid rail-trail. After your double-lefting, pass <br/>
over and under railroad tracks for 0.6 miles to bear left on Totoket <br/>
Rd. In 0.4 miles, after passing through a golf course, take your <br/>
first left on an unmarked road with a Tilton 190 sign. Miss the turn <br/>
and go a bit too far and you'll see Juniper Point Rd. Park near the <br/>
big concrete blocks with the locals.<br/>
<br/>
Rail trailing: In the northeast corner of the parking lot, head east <br/>
over the tracks with the white blazes for an east to west out-and-<br/>
back hike with a couple of spurs to the letterboxes. Follow the <br/>
boardwalk over salt marshes with lots of birds and fiddler crabs. <br/>
Regaining land, the official white blazed trail turns left. We'll <br/>
turn right, south, on a fainter unmarked trail that weaves down to <br/>
the marshes. You'll cross a boulder strewn brook on the way: there <br/>
are several faint side trails, but if you head generally south you'll <br/>
soon reach a stone wall. Just beyond is a large smoothly rounded <br/>
outcropping, wonderfully splint by a maple. In the slot behind the <br/>
maple, find the Thimble View Letterbox. Visit 50 yards south to a <br/>
lovely smooth viewing spot.<br/>
<br/>
Return to the main rail trail and continue east. Pass under a road <br/>
bridge and out to enjoy the trestle bridge, a delight for children. A <br/>
short way further is Stony Creek, a wonderful refreshment stop. <br/>
Heading back, turn north at #8 on the white blazed loop trail, which <br/>
climbs gently and curves first west, crosses a residential street, <br/>
and then bends south to an absolutely stunning overlook with a <br/>
monument. At the 3-way junction by the overlook, you'll find a rooty <br/>
oak tree a step off trail at bearing 130 degrees. Behind that is a <br/>
low smooth shard of granite that is "picked up" on the south side. <br/>
The Trolley Car Letterbox is under a larger than usual trap door in <br/>
the southeast corner.<br/>
<br/>
Continue down the white trail to regain the Trolley Trail, turning <br/>
right (if you must) back to civilization.<br/>
