I realized today that that the way I put my answer to you when you<br/>
replied with your new "Avast ye landlubbers!" clues, and also with my<br/>
email with the current clues I am writing, that my laughter looked<br/>
like it was aimed at you and not at me. It was directed at myself and<br/>
the plain way of my writing in comparason to the richness of phrase<br/>
you seem to conjure up so easily, or at least you make it look easy<br/>
which is all the more gifted.  So, my apologies for my words, it was<br/>
not my intention to cause offense or hurt because my laughter was at<br/>
myself. I admire your ability to write.<br/>

No worries at all catbead, I did not take it negatively, rather, I took it the way that you intended it...  My 'gift of prose' is not something that came naturally, but came from many years of story telling and refining... And to this day, I still am my own worst critic!  I never think my stuff is good enough. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the apology, both public and private, that in and of itself, manes more than anything else to me.... Your words are a breath of fresh air on the mailing lists where most seem to be bent on voicing their displeasures than their pleasures.<br/>
