<br/>
I am new to the sport (if that's what it is) and the list.  I found the Max <br/>
Patch box on Sunday.  Had a great time trying to figure out if our compass <br/>
was off, or we were not "reading into" the clues right, or whatever, but <br/>
finally did find it without our clothing and flesh being shredded by <br/>
waist-high brambles.  What a beautiful place!<br/>
<br/>
I live in the NC mountains in the summer, and a smallish city in Florida in <br/>
the winter.  I saw Jay's blurb about LbNA on the Walklist a couple of months <br/>
ago, and, cuz I remembered the Smithsonian article, just had to check it <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, I was always making treasure maps for my little sister and <br/>
her friends, so this is right up my proverbial alley.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am now inspired to plant some boxes - the USFS here has been very <br/>
accommodating to me as trailmaster of the Asheville Amblers (walking club), <br/>
and if I need their permission to plant some boxes, I'm pretty sure I'll get <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm leaving Friday for a cross-country trip to the American Volkssport <br/>
Association convention in Bellevue, WA.  I did a similar trip last summer, <br/>
and did a 10k walk every morning on the way.  A few of the 10ks, this time, <br/>
however, will be replaced by letterbox hunts.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to let you know that, as a newbie, I do not find the "policy" type <br/>
discussions off-putting, as we have the same sort of issues in <br/>
volkssporting; it comes with the territory.  Our web czarina created a <br/>
separate list for issues, and it works well.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to order several decals (my husband is a VW bus collector, and <br/>
I use a Subaru Brat here in the mountains), and if you go into t-shirts, one <br/>
of those, too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
