                    <div class="plaintext-content">"A good day in the mountains!" is the last line of the clues for the Drew <br/>
clan's two Holyoke Range range letterboxes (in western Massachusetts), and <br/>
it's no lie!  I set out on this sunny but slightly cool Saturday afternoon <br/>
with the modest hope of perhaps finding one of  the two boxes; I left <br/>
feeling elated because I'd found both.<br/>
<br/>
If you are anywhere near this part of the country, you owe it to yourself to <br/>
look for the Mount Norwottuck and Rattlesnake Knob boxes that the Drews have <br/>
hidden on the Metacomet Monadnock Trail on the Holyoke Range.  Quite a bit <br/>
of steep climbing on rocky trails, but man, the views are worth it!  This <br/>
was a stretch for me as a hiker, and sometimes along the way up I thought, <br/>
if these boxes are tricky to locate and I can't find them after all this <br/>
exertion, I will be so bummed!  But, thankfully, the boxes don't require <br/>
membership in Mensa to find; in fact, they are the icing on the cake after <br/>
the treats of the hiking and the views.<br/>
<br/>
I ambled downhill happily after locating the boxes, feeling this had been an <br/>
afternoon well spent.  I swear the chickadees were singing songs of <br/>
congratulations.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you'll excuse me, a hot bath loaded with epsom salts awaits my tired <br/>
legs....<br/>

through my little office basement window yesterday was torture! If I<br/>

You're a jewel, and we love your boxes along the same bit of white<br/>
