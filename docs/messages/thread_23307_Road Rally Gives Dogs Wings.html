                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi to everyone from a very excited and stunned fellow boxer,<br/>
I am not a big advocate of crossposting but I feel that there is a good<br/>
reason for what I am about to post.  Some of you may have seen the story<br/>
on Mark Pepe's blog on Atlas Quest about the plight of some friends of<br/>
ours from southeastern Pennsylvania, Dogs with Wings.  In case you<br/>
haven't, here is what was posted:<br/>
<br/>
Last summer, a new boxing couple joined the southeastern Pennsylvania<br/>
boxing community. Their trail name is Dogs with Wings and, Sherry, the<br/>
carving half of the team, and I got to know each other through emails<br/>
after she found several of my boxes near her home .   We have been<br/>
corresponding for many months and I was fortunate enough to actually<br/>
meet the team in person on one of my ventures to Hibernia Park in<br/>
Chester County, PA.  She loves letterboxing and has proven to be a<br/>
really good carver.  Well, Sherry and Lee are having some difficulties<br/>
right now and I would like to try to help her out.  Lee was on his way<br/>
to work about a month ago when he was struck with a great deal of pain<br/>
and had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance.  From the Paoli<br/>
Hospital, where he was diagnosed with an extremely rare and severe case<br/>
of pancreatitis, he was airlifted to Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia<br/>
and placed on a ventilator.    He sank into a coma and the disease began<br/>
to attack some of his other organs.  He was given a 20% chance of<br/>
survival at that time.<br/>
<br/>
As if this wasn't enough, there is more to their story.  Lee had just<br/>
started a new job within the last year so his short term disability<br/>
benefits are very limited.  Sherry had worked up until two months ago,<br/>
but since she is studying to be a nurse, she quit her job so that she<br/>
could focus full time on finishing her degree.   Sherry has obtained a<br/>
job at a local hospital but won't begin working till July.  So this<br/>
means that they now have very limited income.  Sherry is spending as<br/>
much time at Jefferson as she can as well as finishing up her classes<br/>
and is totally exhausted, physically and emotionally.  The hospital and<br/>
the school are about two hours drive away from each other which places<br/>
another burden on her.  She talks longingly of being able to walk in the<br/>
woods with her husband again and of being able to enjoy the simple<br/>
pleasures of letterboxing.  She is totally in love with her husband and<br/>
is very broken by this terrible illness.<br/>
<br/>
When I spoke to her last night, she gave me some good news.  After a<br/>
month in a coma, Lee has finally regained consciousness and was removed<br/>
temporarily from the ventilator that has been keeping him alive.  The<br/>
prognosis is much more encouraging now than it was a month ago. The<br/>
doctors believe that the damage to his lungs may heal itself but his<br/>
pancreas is severely damaged.  They are not sure what to expect from<br/>
anything else.  The only thing that they ARE sure of is that recovery is<br/>
going to take some time.<br/>
<br/>
So this brings me to my plea for help.  We are asking for the<br/>
letterboxing community to give something to this couple in the form of a<br/>
flat donation or a pledge to any participant in the Road Rally.  The<br/>
pledge would be for each box found during the Rally, either those<br/>
planted by the Rallymaster or the "distractions"  planted by various<br/>
participating teams.  You can obtain information about the Rally at<br/>
roadrally.blogspot.com which also gives the details of last year's<br/>
Rally.  So far there are seven teams signed up for the race with more<br/>
expected shortly.<br/>
<br/>
The message above is what was posted but there have been a few more<br/>
details added since then.  Crayola Posse, who are two of the best<br/>
carvers that I have seen, have volunteered to make an event stamp to be<br/>
given to anyone who donates.  Although it hasn't even been designed yet,<br/>
I KNOW that you won't be disappointed in their work.  I would also like<br/>
to collect a copy of every contributor's stamp to add to a logbook for<br/>
Sherry and Lee.  Please let me know if you can help in any way by<br/>
contacting me at janila at dejazzd.com.<br/>
