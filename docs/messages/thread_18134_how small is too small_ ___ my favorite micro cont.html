                    <div class="plaintext-content">    Microboxes are the staple crop for urban letterboxes, it seems.  It makes sense, for discretion and for finding suitable hiding places.  One would just have to do maintenance on it more often to replace the paper.  For some, I've had to really search to find a place left on it to stamp in.  Keep a good e-address for the 'contact the placer' for just such a heads-up!<br/>
     I wouldn't recommend a microbox for a place you only check on once per year.<br/>

  My favorite size micro-boxes are 50 mm centrifuge tubes.  Not as small<br/>
  as yours, but longer than a film canister (about 5") and a lot easier<br/>
  to tuck into little nooks and crannies than a regular sized box.  I<br/>
  roll up 3-4 sheets of paper into a scroll for a logbook along with a<br/>
  protective cover.  They're waterproof, can be boiled, and frozen to <br/>
  -70 F.  A bunch can fit into a baggie or slip a couple into a pocket.<br/>
  Best of all they're cheap, about 12 each.<br/>
