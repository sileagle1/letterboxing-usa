Fair Oaks Letterbox<br/>
Fair Oaks, Sacramento County, California<br/>
Placed by Nebiru on November 2, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Fair Oaks is a quaint little village twenty miles northeast of <br/>
Sacramento, on the bluffs above the American River. The box is <br/>
situated along the American River Parkway trail system, consisting <br/>
of level, woodsy paved bike and sand equestrian paths. We've chosen <br/>
a mile-long section that we think shows off some of the finest <br/>
charms of the river canyon. It makes a fine walk or ride, <br/>
particularly on a cool fall evening. Wear old shoes, as part of the <br/>
trail consists of a fine, ruddy dust.<br/>
<br/>
The village is most easily reached via I-50, exiting at Sunrise <br/>
Blvd. and heading north for about three miles. After crossing the <br/>
river, you'll see an intersection with a light - turn right onto <br/>
Bridge Street, and take it the few blocks to its end (though if you <br/>
bring a backpack, you may want to detour north on Fair Oaks Blvd. <br/>
and stop at the Coffeehouse &amp; Deli across from the village park to <br/>
grab a delicious sandwich or two for a trailside picnic). Just park <br/>
along the side of the road - watching out for the roaming resident <br/>
chickens that make the village famous!<br/>
<br/>
Cross the river on the old orange rail bridge. Look far below for <br/>
salmon, ducks, and rafters, and watch the trusses above for pigeons, <br/>
gulls, and magpies! The trail curves sharply to the right and down <br/>
towards the river, where it eventually ends at the main path. Turn <br/>
left here. <br/>
<br/>
Stay on this trail, passing beneath Sunrise Blvd. (pedestrians <br/>
should use the left shoulder on this high-traffic section of the <br/>
trail). Eventually you will reach a parking lot, and a wooden sign <br/>
that directs you to Goethe Park (left) or Sacramento Bar (right). <br/>
Bear right.<br/>
<br/>
Cross the river again on "Jim's Bridge" (afterwards, you can read a <br/>
bit about it on the boulder-mounted plaque near the rustic restrooms <br/>
to the right of the trail). Remain on the main trail, which will <br/>
veer to the left.<br/>
<br/>
You'll pass a beautiful little wooded picnic area on the right - the <br/>
perfect spot to enjoy those deli sandwiches. Continuing on, you'll <br/>
encounter a slight rise among large piles of river rock. <br/>
<br/>
Watch the left shoulder of the trail - you'll see a raised manhole <br/>
that seems out of place. Turn right on the first unpaved equestrian <br/>
trail after that.<br/>
<br/>
On this path, you'll see a well-groomed yard on the right with a <br/>
mammoth oak tree that's hard to miss. Two large stumps will then <br/>
also be seen to your right (the second with a large hole in the <br/>
front), immediately followed by one on the left. Stand in front of <br/>
this third stump (with your back to the trail). At approximately 30 <br/>
degrees, you'll see a tree that looks like it has its legs straight <br/>
up in the air. You'll find two rocks at the base of the tree, and <br/>
the box beneath them.<br/>
<br/>
The trail is fairly well-travelled, so please take care when <br/>
locating and replacing the box. Report any problems with the box to <br/>
nebiruletterbox@aol.com.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
Darin and Jennie<br/>
