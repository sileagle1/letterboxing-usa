<div>Was looking for these 2 boxes on Mon. and were not able to 
locate either one.  F&amp;F clues were pretty easy &amp; I am fairly 
certain we were in the right place, but came up empty handed.  We figured 
out the DM clues &amp; were in what we thought was the right place, but could 
very easily be off.  Any confirmations these are intact?  We'll try 
again... Thanks  Kate</div></body></html>
