                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I like Martha. I really like Martha. No one has done as much <br/>
for raising the awareness of the ART of homemaking as she has. No <br/>
one has brought to the forefront so many of the varied layers of <br/>
CREATIVITY involved in homemaking. Truly she does it all well. <br/>
Perfectly, in fact. <br/>
<br/>
However, there are increasing problems with her visit here with me. <br/>
The poor woman is quickly developing a nervous tick. She has been <br/>
hitting the wine a little early in the day, just to get through her <br/>
days here, I fear. I don't think she is getting adequate sleep at <br/>
night. I know she only sleeps about 5 hours each night, anyway, but <br/>
ever since the cat moved her newborn kittens into Martha's bed (on <br/>
her special Egyptian cotton high thread count sheets that she <br/>
brought with her) in the middle of the night, things have taken a <br/>
downward turn. Unfortunately, the dogs have started raising the hair <br/>
on their backs, and hiding behind the recliner whenever she walks <br/>
into the room. Our oldest and youngest sons ran off to Mexico days <br/>
after her visit began! Then when they returned and brought me that <br/>
inspiring Elvis on Velvet painting, she got positively white around <br/>
the mouth. The neighbors are complaining too. She is vocal in her <br/>
complaints about their fence placements and landscaping. (I have <br/>
hidden my car keys!) But the final straw (SOB!) came when I caught <br/>
her red-handed uprooting my flock of pink plastic flamingos in the <br/>
middle of the night and depositing them in the garbage can! Luckily, <br/>
I saved my bottle tree, but I just know my sock monkeys will be next <br/>
on her hit list!  <br/>
<br/>

There are still two that I know of who indicated that they wanted to <br/>
host Martha, but whose emails I never received (if they were in fact <br/>
sent). They are:<br/>
<br/>
THE DREW FAMILY<br/>
NEIL S. (FOREST FROGS) <br/>
<br/>
Please contact me right away, as Martha won't last much longer. <br/>
Contact me DIRECTLY from your email carrier, don't use the link on <br/>
the forum, as they don't work for me, apparently. So sorry for the <br/>
hassle! <br/>
