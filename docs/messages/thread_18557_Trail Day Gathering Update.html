<br/>
So I just got home from West Palm Beach to find my inbox full of <br/>
emails about camping overnight at the trail day gathering.  Thank <br/>
you for all of your prompt feedback.  I will be filling for the <br/>
camping permit sometime this week.  If there are any additions to <br/>
the following list, please get in touch with me immediately!  :)<br/>
<br/>
I have sent out emails to a few letterboxers who I have not seen in <br/>
a while.  The "Perfect Circle Letterboxing Group" from NJ/PA may be <br/>
coming as well as Randy Hall.  Please spread the word to all of our <br/>
fellow letterboxers from all over.  The more you do the better this <br/>
gathering will be!<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see everyone there ... Safe Letterboxing!<br/>

There is very specific information I need from all who are planning<br/>
on attending this event.<br/>
<br/>
1) Tarrywile Park will be doing trail maintenance including trail<br/>
repair and re-painting the trail system. Anyone interested in<br/>
participating will recieve lunch courtesy of the park. Trail<br/>
maintenance will run all morning. Please plan on arriving early to<br/>
make the most of the day.<br/>
<br/>
2) I would love to hear from each person who plan on attending so<br/>
that we can get a rough idea of how many people we should plan for.<br/>
<br/>
3) The Great American Stamp Store will be selling carving supplies<br/>
(including the 6x11 pink stuff) and wants to know how much of each<br/>
they should bring. I will base that on the number of people<br/>
coming. However, if you have plans on purchasing specific items,<br/>
let me know and I will make sure they order more.<br/>
<br/>
4) CAMPING! All camping will take place in the area around the<br/>
water tower. The permits will be issued in groups of six people. I<br/>
need the names and address of each person who plans on camping<br/>
overnight. These permits need to be issued very soon.<br/>
<br/>
