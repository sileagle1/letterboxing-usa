&gt; &gt; If your feeling so inclined, we few letterboxers here in MN would <br/>
&gt; &gt; love to have a new box to search for! (hint, hint) :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes it helps to plant a box or two as well.  When I first <br/>
placed a box in my hometown of San Luis, there weren't any boxes for <br/>
a hundred miles in any direction...  &gt; <br/>
&gt; Then, a year or two later, BAM!  Letterboxing absolutely <br/>
EXPLODED... <br/>

I think Ryan is right, in part. Once we start placing more boxes here <br/>
in Minnesota, hopefully, others will look for them and place boxes of <br/>
their own. <br/>
<br/>
However, I do think there are some other proactive things that we <br/>
might be able to come up with. Such as arranging for letterbox <br/>
seminars with outdoors stores, rubber stamp stores, boy/girl scout <br/>
groups, etc. Does anyone out there have any ideas about getting <br/>
boxing going here in Minnesota? Any success stories like Ryans' you'd <br/>
care to share for those of us in Minnesota or other areas who'd like <br/>
to step it up where they live?<br/>

If you plant them, they will come.  When I started here in Idaho <br/>
August 2002, there were only 2 boxes in this state.  After a while I <br/>
was bored of planting and would travel FAR to find some, but look at <br/>
our state now.  We're even having a gathering this weekend with <br/>
several folks from Idaho and it's going to grow even more.  Thanks to <br/>
all those who have travelled through our state, left some for us to <br/>
find even mystery boxes, and stamped into our boxes.  We're so <br/>
excited.  So I encourage you to keep planting them and slowly others <br/>
will too.  =-)  We have cousins there in Minnesota and one day <br/>
they'll be getting married so you can count on some more boxes placed <br/>
by us in MN whenever that day comes.  =-)  <br/>

Hey, why limit yourself?  At least a trio of out-of-state folks will <br/>
attend, too!  ;)<br/>
