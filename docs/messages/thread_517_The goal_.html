<div>Regarding the 'goal' of letterboxing, I thought 
I'd share with you the reasons I love the hobby. First it gets me onto Dartmoor 
and secondly, finding a letterbox that someone else has hidden especially for me 
to find is still a thrill even though I'm approaching 2000 boxes.</div>
<div>I guess it's only the number of boxes we have 
over here that makes the real difference between the US and UK 
letterboxers.  I know that wherever I go on the Moor, I'll find something, 
but I try to aim for the more remote ones which are less easy to find.  We 
have a whole variety of boxes and clues.  Staright forward clues with a 6 
figure grid reference and bearings off landmarks, clues with a 4 figure 
reference and bearings, clues with no grid reference but bearings, and then, the 
hardest, just a few bearings or cryptic clue.  Of course there are also 
thousands which have been put out with no clues at all.  So there's 
something for eveyone.</div>
<div>Anyway, as far as I'm concerned letterboxing gives me a reason 
to get on Dartmoor.</div>
