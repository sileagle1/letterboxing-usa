the The Castle of Love LB in excellent condition.  We also found Young's <br/>
Great Rock/Wigwam Point Light.  This box took three tries and a trip to the <br/>
Gloucester Library at which point we realized we had been right by it the <br/>
first two times.  Next was Kokopelli's Flute LB in Lynn.  Found in good <br/>
shape. We then went on to find the Marblehead Rail Trail LB, which was <br/>
slightly damp, we dried it off and put it back.  Everything was bagged so the <br/>
stamp and log book were not damaged.  With the Marblehead Rail LB was the <br/>
Larry the Lobster HH.  Next was Saugus and the Breakhart Reservation LB, it <br/>
was a beautiful walk.  Finally we stopped in Lincoln on the way home and did <br/>
the Two Hearts LB.  We had never been do DeCOrdova Sculpture Park, what a <br/>
wonderful place.  I'm glad we stopped there on the way home.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the people who planted these boxes.  We had a great time <br/>
finding them.<br/>
