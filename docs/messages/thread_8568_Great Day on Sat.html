We enjoyed the Accotink Wildlife Refuge and the wonderful boxes that <br/>
were there.  Unfortunately, Mary had to leave us after finding four of <br/>
the boxes so Bern and I continued the journey.  We are sorry to report <br/>
that we could not find "Sir Mooseness" in the McCarty Farm Series.  We <br/>
found the spot, the indentation in the earth where the box was, and the <br/>
rock used to cover it, but no box.  I guess he decided to wander off <br/>
into the woods.  Do mooses migrate? :) The other two were in great <br/>
condition and were wonderful to find.<br/>
<br/>
We then headed off to Mason Neck to enjoy a little Jimmy Buffet and <br/>
after getting a clue wrong and much hiking, we were finally successful <br/>
and elated to discover a little "Chinese Food To Go" waiting in <br/>
"Letterbox in Paradise"!  Our first ADG find!!!  Woo-hoo!!!  We also <br/>
found the "Nesting Eagles" box in the park.<br/>
<br/>
After getting 10 boxes Saturday (our record for one day) I feel the <br/>
urge to try for 11!  I'm so addicted!<br/>
