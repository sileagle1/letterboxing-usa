Speaking of ghoti... I "think" I know the location, but how the heck do you figure our where in that location?... Hey Ledge... Is it ok to ask for confirmation?  This seedling has been transplanted upstate... It's an awful long way to travel only to wander through the stinkiness looking for the elusive prize.<br/>
<br/>
I'm headed for the others, though I've heard one has gone missing... though I'm not sure I'd go if I can't get all the way to the top.<br/>

<br/>
The WHERE is very evident in the clues. The clues tell you EXACTLY <br/>
where to look for the box. (and it was stinky when I was there! :-)<br/>
<br/>
There are plans in the works to replace the missing Apple. <br/>
