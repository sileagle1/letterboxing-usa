                    <div class="plaintext-content">A "C" is used by some to denote confiscated boxes, which are boxes <br/>
that were planted and then confiscated by the park service (i.e. in <br/>
National Parks or other areas that are not letterbox-friendly).<br/>
<br/>
Some people have been using "A" for attempted finds, but you could <br/>
use it to indicate adopted boxes if you would like.  It is your count <br/>
and it really only matters to you...  although be prepared to answer <br/>
questions if you have letters other than the ordinary.<br/>
<br/>
I don't count boxes that I have adopted at all, as I do not count <br/>
boxes that have been sent to me by another boxer to be placed in <br/>
Michigan, or boxes that I send to other places to be placed there, <br/>
usually as part of a series.  But that's just me...  I'm not really <br/>
into the numbers, so I don't really care if they show up in a count <br/>
or not.<br/>
<br/>
Do it however it makes sense to you.<br/>

That's what I thought as well... didn't seem kosher to me, but I <br/>
wanted to find out just how most of you were using these.  I like the <br/>
idea of "Ad" for adopted... think I'll use that one.  :O)<br/>
<br/>
Ah well, whatever works!  Thanks!<br/>

I don't count Attempted boxes or Confiscated boxes. I just keep trying until<br/>
I get the attempted ones and I haven't confiscated any yet! My "C" stands<br/>
for Carved Stamps (which I'm sure is more than 8 but I have to check!)<br/>
