  They are 10, 12, 14 and 16 and I think that only <br/>
&gt; the 16 year old actually "gets it".  What should be an enjoyable <br/>
&gt; adventure outdoors has become something I do not look forward to <br/>
&gt; doing with them.  <br/>
<br/>
I have heard the rumor that at about 10 years old aliens abduct <br/>
children, implant their alien brain in them and return them to <br/>
earth.Then about 20 years old they're abducted again, have the alien <br/>
brain removed and are returned to earth. It's not their fault it is <br/>
all caused by the damn aliens.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Maybe in your neck of the woods, but out here in the East Coast a teenager wakes up, say, on their 13th or 14th birthday. Somehow overnight they have been given all the knowledge in the Universe, or at least way more than thier dumb parents possess. This lasts about 10-12 years, based on my experience. then one day around their 25th birthday, they realize maybe they don't actually know everything and maybe Mom or Dad might have the occasional clue. My 26 year old is a pleasure again and my 20 and 21 year olds are up for adoption. Want 'em?<br/>
