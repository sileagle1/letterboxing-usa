                    <div class="plaintext-content">After a pleasant flutterby with Nancy,Gina,Lisa and Paul at Buck Hill <br/>
last weekend, we proceeded to visit some "old and new friends" on Mt. <br/>
Higby.  Guinevere, the Black Knight and Larry were all at home, but <br/>
Barb seems to have gone off and left only a pile of rocks behind!<br/>
(Just so nobody feels disappointed if they go looking and don't catch <br/>
her in!) Janet, by the way, became the first person to catch US in the <br/>
other night for our home box and a flutterby! Not much time left if <br/>
anyone else wants to try to do that before the lovely bug flies away! <br/>
(As per legerdemaine's directions, she'll be leaving with the person <br/>
whose name gets picked from a funky old alligator hat, probably around <br/>
1PM on Saturday, May 11th at the Sleeping Giant!!!)<br/>
