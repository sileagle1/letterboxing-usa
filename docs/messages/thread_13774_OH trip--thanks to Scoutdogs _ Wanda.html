They took time out of their busy boxing schedule to provide us with our first-ever exchanges--yippeee!  (Who'da figured that the first exchanges for people living in Oregon would be with a boxer from Ohio and another from RI!)<br/>
<br/>
We had a lovely visit.  Maybe next time I can schedule a longer vist and get some of those many Cincinnati boxes!<br/>
