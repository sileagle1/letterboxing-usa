I started out with store bought stamps from my scrapbooking stuff too, but I'm positive that this is for me. If you don't want to spend the money to buy a stamp, you can get good carving stuff for very little money. I really like the white erasers. They're small and fairly cheap. We still use the pencil eraser trick to carve. I still do use my store bought stamp pretty regularly, but the self-carved stuff can really give you a sense of accomplishment and it really represents you. I am "Roseslady" because my husband's name is "Rose", so I am Rose's lady. ;) My stamp is a hand drawn rose. My stepson's trail name is "JacksonFanatic" because he is totally over the moon obsessed with Micheal Jackson... We are still planning his stamp. For now, he's only been geocaching because he doesn't want to letterbox until he knows what he wants it to look like. Thanx for posting and welcome to Letterboxing. :) --Candy 		 	   		  <br/>
