We visited the Letter from a Traitor box at Ft. Trumbull today in CT <br/>
&amp; all is well.  <br/>
<br/>
We tried to get Popeye as well, but he was being guarded by the US <br/>
Navy's USS McInerny who had pulled into port at the Fort for a <br/>
couple days apparently.  The guards, park employees &amp; many visitors <br/>
seemed a bit too much of a challenge for us to sneak the box out <br/>
from underneath so we'll have to head back another day!  :)<br/>
