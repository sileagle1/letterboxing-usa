                    <div class="plaintext-content">    Contrary to our friend's experience below, I am happy to report <br/>
finding all five boxes in the Tarrywile Park series during a recent <br/>
vacation. On my way north, I used the orienteering map to find 2, 4, <br/>
and 1. On my way back south, I used the beacon tower access road to <br/>
shortcut to 3.<br/>
<br/>
    All boxes are in good shape. The log "book" for the bonus is <br/>
full. The bag covering #4 is shredded and could stand to be replaced <br/>
(gallon size ziploc), although the box is fine.<br/>
<br/>
    I'd like to recommend against shortcutting to #3 from Terre Haute <br/>
Road. The tower access road is washed out, making for very rough, <br/>
unpleasant hiking. There is also a jerk of a landowner with grudges <br/>
against the park who harassed me and one other hiker for parking <br/>
(legally) on Terre Haute.<br/>
<br/>
    70 Million Years Ago was a DNF. The area seems well trampled. The <br/>
clue said "start digging". I hope that wasn't meant literally.<br/>
<br/>
    Portsmouth Harbor Light was a DNF. I wandered all over the park <br/>
and could not make even part of the bearings in the clue fit any <br/>
spot. I question whether this one ever existed. I do not believe that <br/>
the clues are mathematically possible in this area. Reports to the <br/>
contrary are welcome.<br/>
<br/>
    Nubble Light at Cape Neddick ME was too crowded for a search. <br/>
Three photographers were using the bench in the clue as a riser.<br/>
<br/>
    Other finds include Elizabeth Park in Hartford CT. Nicely hidden <br/>
box, but there is no discrete place for a boxer to hide while <br/>
stamping.<br/>
    Live Free or Die at Fort Stark NH was a nice intro to a spot that <br/>
isn't signed or on most maps. The fort was a little buggy. There is a <br/>
benchmark in that clue, so those so inclined can add one to that <br/>
total while letterboxing.<br/>
    Hear the Sea at Fort Constitution NH was found, as was a cache in <br/>
another part of the fort. The box is in good shape, but I took the <br/>
last postcard. While stamping there (9-24 @ 1115 or so), I noticed <br/>
what appeared to be a letterboxer at the viewpoint in Fort McCleary <br/>
ME, lining up the bearing in the clue for the box there.<br/>
    Squirell's Cape Henlopen DE Box was found during a fine sunset. A <br/>
cache along the third hole of that park's disc golf course can serve <br/>
as an extra object to find until the second letterbox in this park is <br/>
replaced.<br/>
    Finally, Easter Bunny's Revenge at Plum Point Park in New Windsor <br/>
NY (a cache/letterbox hybrid - both a stamp and trinkets present to <br/>
cover both hobbies - but only listed at geocaching.com) was found <br/>
hidden in some rough briars. For those inclined to try this one <br/>
without a GPS, it is on the small mapped hilltop just to the west of <br/>
where the Topozone target says it is. If you use geocaching.com to <br/>
look up this object, you'll see what that sentence means. Approach it <br/>
from the road to the northwest.<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks to all of the hiders for your efforts.<br/>
