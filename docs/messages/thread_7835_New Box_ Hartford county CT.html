Planted 9/20/02 during practice.  Will we find the ball before the game begins?<br/>
<br/>
So, here I am on another soccer field waiting for practice to end.  What do I see, but a runaway ball heading to the woods.  Can you find it and get it back before the game begins?<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
This ball was lost in Mills Pond Park in Canton, Ct.  You can get there from Rt 44.  You want to turn onto East Hill Rd going south<br/>
(If you are coming from the East, and most boxers in Ct are, you will want to take a left at the light past the Mobil station.  Drive up past the line to trigger the light.)  At the stop sign on East Hill Rd you will have reached the park entrance.<br/>
<br/>
Head down the paved path past the skate park to where the dirt path veers off to the left.  Follow along this path past the pond and over the bridge.  Stay on the sandy path heading south (220 degrees) at the multi-path intersection.<br/>
<br/>
Pass the bike jumps and pit and continue in a southwesterly direction on the path for 31 paces.  Find the tree on which you can take a rest.  That's where the ball has come to a stop in it's wild roll away from the field.  <br/>
<br/>
In case the pit has been filled in, look for the multi trunked tree on the left, 3 trunks of which are dead.  The ball is resting 11 paces beyond this.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately you will have to return the way you have come.  These trails do snake around back in the woods and past the beaver dam if you want to wander some more.  They eventually come out at the High School on the other side of the pond.  That is 'down the street and around the corner' from where you began.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you make it in time for the game.  It's beginning soon...<br/>
<br/>
Any problems, don't e-mail the wonderful carver, RTRW, but send them to me, the lowly planter, cherieph@aol.com
