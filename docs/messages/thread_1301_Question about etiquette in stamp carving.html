graphic,  says 'First in PEI, October 2000'.  My question is, is it <br/>
OK to say this if you are reasonably certain yours is the first?  As <br/>
of now, there is only one Canadian letterbox listed on <br/>
www.letterboxing.org, and that's in Quebec.  <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if this is appropriate.  I'll be carving the stamp <br/>
in the next few days, since we're heading up there next Saturday. <br/>
