I do BookCrossings, too!<br/>

I think the ONLY thing that you shouldn't leave in a box is any sort of food<br/>
(attracts wild animals). My sister leaves hand-made bookmarks, and others<br/>
leave little gifts. Go for it!<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Hi Caroline,
</p><p>Welcome to letterboxing! I am sure you will get varied responses to your queries and this is just my two cents worth. 
</p><p>I am familiar with Bookcrossing and just had a look-see at the Found Art site to see what it was all about (*Sigh*..wish I was artistic). Planting a letterbox with a favorite book or piece of your artwork to share with a finder would seem like a good idea. As a letterboxer, finding someone's personal artwork in a box would be a pleasant surprise. After all, we all take the image of the box owner's handmade stamp away with us and many of is would consider these personal stamps art.
</p><p>Since we are such a diverse group, IMHO, your idea probably would not be totally out of line with the spirit of letterboxing. Some may interpret your idea as somewhat akin to geocaching, a hobby where you take something from a cache (planted and found using a GPS from clues on the <a href="http://www.geocaching.com">www.geocaching.com</a> site) and then exchange what you take for something you brought with you. I have never geocached and so do not know if personal artwork or books are ever found in caches.
</p><p>I would just be very careful about where you hide your letterbox in terms of potential for discovery  by those with ill intent and vandalism on their minds. Many letterboxers advise discretion in their clues when a letterbox is hidden in a very public place. In that respect, smaller is better and a container large enough to include a book might be more difficult to conceal for both yourself as well as those who find the box and attempt to stamp in and rehide without drawing alot of attention. 
</p><p>Do you plan to replenish the book or art periodically or just leave something there for the first finder? If the latter is your plan, then after the first stamp-in, you might move the logbook and stamp into a smaller container for better concealment.
</p><p>Enjoy your meanderings! You did not tell us what part of the world you are from.

&gt;<br/>
    Well, the books have a code you can enter into the system to let <br/>
know that the book has been found - thus it *can* tell me whether or not <br/>
the book has been taken.  My ideal is to check on my box about once a <br/>
month or so?  Having an extra book in hand/backpack, ready to go if it's <br/>
empty (or an extra stamp/pad to replace if necessary).  My theory was to <br/>
put the whole shebang in a tupperware container, bury the container up <br/>
to the lid, and the put an identifying rock on it, the rock is lifted, <br/>
and the top of the lid is revealed.  <br/>
<br/>

The *letter* others write is in the log book you also placed in the<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
In order to keep the box small enough to be discreet and easily hidden<br/>
include your stamp, the logbook, and something to write with.<br/>
Some letterboxers also leave a stamp pad or colored pens if their stamp was<br/>
intended to be multi-colored.<br/>
When hiding the box think about places that are right near the trail so that<br/>
leaving the trail is kept at a minimum. Think why would someone look *here*,<br/>
it is just a clump of ferns or bushes, if they weren't looking for a<br/>
letterbox. When walking along trails, one usually doesn't look at every fern<br/>
and bush but at the environment in general, unless something catches your<br/>
eye.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind the season that you placed the box.<br/>
It might be well covered in summer, but completely exposed in the winter due<br/>
to foliage dying back.<br/>
The same is true in fall or winter when there is a lot of leaves on the<br/>
ground that won't be there in the spring or summer.<br/>
<br/>
Geo-cachers leave other *stuff* in their boxes and no personal stamp.<br/>

<br/>
This is not entirely true, we have a geocache/letterbox hybrid which <br/>
has "stuff" AND a stamp.  I have seen boxes posted here that have a <br/>
little extra treasure in them as well.  In fact we have a letterbox <br/>
called American Pride that has patriotic ribbons for Sept. 11th.<br/>
Anythng you want to do, you should do, as long as its friendley to <br/>
the environment :o)  <br/>
So have fun!<br/>
