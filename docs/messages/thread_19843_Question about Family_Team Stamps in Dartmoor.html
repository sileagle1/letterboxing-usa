<br/>
Our time to depart is drawing near - 5 weeks from Friday and the <br/>
troups are getting antsy! They've started talking about food and <br/>
British slang and the like - plus - we just drew for sleeping <br/>
arrangements and I'm in one cottage with 3 other women besides Sue!!<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
One question came up and we thought the sages on this list could lend <br/>
their wisdom. One of our travelers has a Team Stamp that represents <br/>
11 people, among 2 different families. Only 2 of this team will be <br/>
traveling to Dartmoor with our group. <br/>
<br/>
QUESTION: Do you think this couple should exchange with British <br/>
boxers using their Team stamp, their individual stamps or both?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your input.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

<br/>
My personal opinion would be that the couple should use their individual<br/>
stamps.  I think for any exchange they would use their individual stamp,<br/>
with the Team Stamp being a "bonus" when they are together as a group (Or at<br/>
least a significant number of them)<br/>
<br/>
Definitely not a sage,<br/>

wonder he didn't make the smile bigger :-D<br/>
<br/>
As for 'family' team stamp, if the Brits do exchanges, ask if they <br/>
want the team + 2member stamps, it may just be a matter of time and <br/>
space.  Does the 'family' usually use the team stamp when all 11 <br/>
members aren't at the box/gather/exchange?  What is their 'family' <br/>
rule?  <br/>
