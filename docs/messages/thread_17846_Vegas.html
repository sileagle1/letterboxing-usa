                    <div class="plaintext-content">I happened to be in Las Vegas last week for a trade show. While there<br/>
I was pried (I usually just stay in the hotel and let the crazies roam<br/>
the street at night...) form my hotel room by my partner to go to<br/>
dinner and show/experience. We ended up at Madelay Bay for the buffet,<br/>
it's a bit pricey ($23 per head) but well worth it. After which we<br/>
went to the reef exhibit they have there. They give you a "passport"<br/>
(guide) and an earpiece for the tour. At the end of a really cool<br/>
self-guided tour there is a place to "stamp" your passport. It's<br/>
really an embosser. The thought occurred to me that one could carve a<br/>
stamp and Velcro it under the passport embosser for other letter<br/>
boxers. Better yet, the management of the hotel could do it and leave<br/>
the stamp attached to the machine for those who desire to chase it.<br/>
Just a thought for someone who lives in Vegas.<br/>
