had a hard time getting it out, as the rock "door" to the hiding place was<br/>
frozen in place!!   Luckily hubby was with me and able to wrench it loose.<br/>
The box was in good shape and we enjoyed the story in the logbook.   :-)   A<br/>
find well worth the time and effort!!     Ours was called "Knockando."   :-)<br/>

Happy New Year!<br/>
<br/>
On the last day of 2005 , went to find the last lb of the year!  It was<br/>
tricky to find and needed some extra help but there it was, in good shape<br/>
but looking its age. Its covering was showing signs of rough times. Like<br/>
an old "John Waynes Movie" called " The Shepherd of the Hills"  this LBB<br/>
was hanging the ledge about shoulder height on the left side of the<br/>
western edge.<br/>
