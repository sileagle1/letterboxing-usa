                    <html><body>Just started letterboxing and am absolutely loving it.  I think that it would be good to know when a letterbox is missing (as I'm learning many are) BUT even though I've struck out 3 out of 5 times I still loved the hunt, and the places it brought me to.  As a beginner I think the website is excellent, but I can see that as people have grown with this blossoming sport that possibly the website needs tweaking.  The geocaching website is more advanced, but this letterboxing site has a certain charm and simplicity to it that holds the same appeal to me as letterboxing does.  You guys have done a great job and I'm sure you'll figure it out.<br/>
