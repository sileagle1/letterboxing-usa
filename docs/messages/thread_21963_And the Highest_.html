though.  I'm thinking we might be the 'last' folks who ever visit this <br/>
particular box as the mountain started rumbling again less than 21 days <br/>
after we visited.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I planted one on a volcano (outside of NPS territory) in <br/>
the US that's been erupting since the 80s--it went missing about two <br/>
years after we hid it, we don't know if it got swallowed up in a lava <br/>
tube or if it just floated away into the Pacific.  ;)<br/>
