                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wednesday morning I headed east -- my ultimate goal being to spend a <br/>
few days with a friend in New Jersey, with planned boxing stops in <br/>
eastern MI, OH, PA, DE along the routes there and back.  The first <br/>
day I found 5 of the 6 boxes (** see below **) I set out to find in <br/>
MI, 2 of them still offering their first-finder certificates (thanks <br/>
Ruthann).  As an added bonus, I picked up 3 hitchhikers (my first) -- <br/>
the 'BackPacker', the 'Painted Turtle' and the 'IL to MI' HH!!!<br/>
<br/>
After finishing up with Mirkwood's boxes at Crosswinds Marsh, I <br/>
headed to Ohio, hitchhikers in tow (good thing I took the SUV), and <br/>
overnighted in the Cleveland area.  My new friends were great company <br/>
on my first night on the road, and I enjoyed the tales of the <br/>
BackPacker's travels over the past 2 years.  In the morning, we <br/>
packed up and set out in search of boxes.  During the course of the <br/>
day, the 'IL to MI' HH found a place he rather enjoyed and decided to <br/>
hang around OH for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
We've since met up with my friend in NJ, who has been initiated to <br/>
letterboxing and has her own beautifully carved stamp as Princess <br/>
Charming.  At one of our stops yesterday the 'Painted Turtle' ran <br/>
into a few of his friends and decided to stick around and visit with <br/>
them for awhile.  He was especially thrilled upon seeing his <br/>
posh 'new' accomodations.<br/>
<br/>
The BackPacker is enjoying our adventures here on the east coast, but <br/>
as he has already seen most of these places, has chosen to make the <br/>
trip back to Michigan with me next week and do some exploring there.  <br/>
Stay tuned for further news of his travels.<br/>
<br/>
We have also planted a couple of new boxes along the way, with a few <br/>
others being placed en route home -- clues to be posted once I return <br/>
to Michigan later next week.<br/>
<br/>
(**) Missing box??  I was unsuccessful in my attempts to find the <br/>
April Fool's box in Hudson Mills Metropark near Dexter, MI.  The <br/>
clues were not too difficult and I am pretty sure I was in the right <br/>
area and did glimpse a freezer-sized ziploc bag where I thought it <br/>
should be, but upon pulling it out, found it full of leaves, stones <br/>
and mud, but no letterbox.  A victim of a prank perhaps?  Wondering <br/>
if anyone has been to this box lately and can confirm its status?  E-<br/>
mail me for more info, I can't be more specific without giving away <br/>
the location.<br/>
