<br/>
I'd propose that we get a bit more scientific about how these go <br/>
missing, and how to prevent it. <br/>
<br/>
If you have ever planted a letterbox and had it go missing, I've <br/>
designed a ten-question survey for you. You may respond for as many <br/>
letterboxes as have gone missing, if the circumstances are different. <br/>
<br/>
At the conclusion, we should know more about good planting.<br/>
<br/>
If you have ever had a letterbox go missing, click here to take a <br/>
survey (multiple responses are allowed):<br/>
http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=830251344185<br/>
<br/>
After 100 responses, I will post the results in the Files section of <br/>
the Letterbox-USA Yahoo Group.<br/>

That was a quick and easy survey.<br/>
<br/>
Wasn't sure where the "homeless" category fell in question 7, so I <br/>
clicked other.  Maybe the Kids/muggles could be expanded to include <br/>
homeless??<br/>

Terrific response so far...<br/>

My favorite, in response to the question "How could we encourage <br/>
finders to replant better?" was the answer, "Hit them over the head <br/>
with a wet noodle." <br/>

&gt; I agree; but instead of "homeless," I'd prefer troublemakers.  In <br/>
some<br/>
&gt; cases, these perfect letterbox spots, are also spots were partyers <br/>
gather.<br/>
&gt;  I will not replant a box if there is a possiblity of an unpleasant<br/>
&gt; encounter.  Just thinkin' family-friendly and safety.<br/>

At this point I can't modify the survey, other than maybe rewording a <br/>
question. <br/>
<br/>
Multiple response are allowed, but you need to complete the survey <br/>
first. Then when you are done, go back to the link and re-click it.<br/>
<br/>
A question with the answer "none of the above" doesn't provide data, <br/>
and open text fields are difficult to analyze, statistically speaking. <br/>
Just pick the closest answer or just e-mail me if you think your <br/>
insight will blow my mind. <br/>
