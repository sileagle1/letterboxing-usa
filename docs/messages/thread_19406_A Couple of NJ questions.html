bunch of great central Jersey clues that I've been doing recently, <br/>
but his site needs some updates, and I can't find a way to contact <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Also does anyone know where Walter C. Meuly woods in NJ are?  I <br/>
assume they're somewhere in Piscataway because he wrote a book about <br/>
that town, but I can't find a reference to these woods <br/>
anywhere...sob.<br/>
