                    <div class="plaintext-content">Shoot!  I just lost the posting I'd started, so here goes again. All <br/>
but one of my finds today were located near the Nathan Hale <br/>
Homestead.  I would have sought many more on the grounds except there <br/>
was a Harvest Fair in progress!  Shrieking children accompanied by <br/>
weary parents, pony rides, horse drawn cart rides. Demonstrations of <br/>
trades, sales of goods, militia men (from both sides of that 1700s <br/>
battle). <br/>
  Finds:   <br/>
  Kind of Corney letterbox by NeedDeeps.  In fine shape.  Placed in <br/>
such a spot where one can hear the excited voices of people <br/>
navigating through the the corn maze set up in a field near the <br/>
homestead. <br/>
  CT. state Stamp:  my first find of this series of state stamps the <br/>
NeeDeeps have been working on for quite a while.<br/>
  The Charter Oak's Great Grandson: one of a number of informative <br/>
letterboxes Irish Tinker has placed. <br/>
  Nathan Hale Forest DEP: waahoo!! my first stamp of this <br/>
series..what can I say?? I'm a slow starter-just remember who won the <br/>
race between the tortoise and the hare. <br/>
  Women of the Revolutionary War series placed by Irish Tinker and <br/>
French Fox. (plus "Pumped Up" add-on by Leader of the Pack).  More <br/>
gret narrative and historical info. written in an engaging manner, <br/>
plus lovely stamps to boot!  Some minor box repairs needed to be done <br/>
and I'll e-mail owners with further info. <br/>
  On my way out, I met 2 bowhunters on their way in.  The season <br/>
started on Monday. (I asked them).  They were very pleasant and <br/>
reasuring about not shooting us unwary hikers, in fact joking about <br/>
being up a tree near a stump where a letterbox was hidden.   No, I <br/>
did not tell them I was a letterboxer. As all clever hunters do, they <br/>
read the clues so to speak:  canvas bag, inky hands, mosquito bites <br/>
and triumphant grin of a success finder. Yes, I will wear orange in <br/>
state hunting areas from now on!!<br/>
  On way home, I snagged Odilio/Irish Tinker/French Fox <br/>
letterbox "The Mary Lemist Titcomb" <br/>
  Super stories, with lots of historical info., superb stamps and I <br/>
am now up to 199 letterboxes found!  Yes, that is partially why I am <br/>
babbling on and on. I am contemplating number 200 and which box it <br/>
should be...<br/>
