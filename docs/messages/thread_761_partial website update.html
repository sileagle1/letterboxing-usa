I have managed to get the Letterboxing North America website partially <br/>
updated to reflect this past season's new letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
In Illinois, the St. Louis Metro East area has been booming with activity in <br/>
the past several months.  Thanks to Mohmers, SpaceDAW, MJLikePink, and the <br/>
Shavers family, there are TEN new boxes in that part of the country, <br/>
including one in St. Louis, Missouri.<br/>
<br/>
For Maryland, there was Lone Wolf's "Numbers, Numbers, Numbers" Letterbox at <br/>
Pocomoke River State Park, and then Jay Drew and his clan placed three boxes <br/>
in Washington, DC.<br/>
<br/>
Randy (the Mapsurfer) made it out West to place four new boxes in Oregon and <br/>
the first box in Nevada.  Meanwhile, Tim Swenson placed three boxes in the <br/>
San Francisco Bay Wildlife Refuge.<br/>
<br/>
I also added a link to Rae Record's page of pictures from the 1999 Vermont <br/>
Letterboxing Conference. It's in the 'JOIN' section towards the bottom of the <br/>
page.  Wish I could have been there!!!<br/>
<br/>
There's still lots to get caught up on.  I've got lots of photos and clue <br/>
updates from Die, and I will get with Randy later to get the new boxes set up <br/>
so they show on adjoining state maps.  Many thanks to Tom for his devoted <br/>
work in the New England-New York area.  The website would be falling apart at <br/>
this point without his support.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, there are probably other things I'm forgetting about.  Let me know of <br/>
any that you're aware of.  Meanwhile, I'm outta here!!!  I'll be seeing the <br/>
New Year arrive in Kansas with Little Foot and Family.  I'll keep an ear to <br/>
the grapevines for breaking news, but otherwise will be pretty scarce for the <br/>
next three weeks... <br/>
...as always, eh?  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
God bless each of you through the holidays and always.<br/>
<br/>
Your friend,<br/>
