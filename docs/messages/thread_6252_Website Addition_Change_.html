<br/>
My friend (who is very new to the hobby) found a letterbox in the What's New <br/>
section of the website.  We made plans to go, but I couldn't find it in the <br/>
Clues pages.  Finally I did a search in the Talk List and found two posts <br/>
(one by the originator) which said that the box was lost.  Now, had my friend <br/>
been doing this by herself, she would have had a disappointing experience.<br/>
<br/>
It was clear in the Clues pages of the site that there was no box there and <br/>
it was clear in the Talk List.  The confusion came from the What's New page, <br/>
because she thought she could go into the archives and find valid boxes! <br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what the answer is.  Maybe something as simple adding a blurb <br/>
that says information in the archives may not be the most current and <br/>
redirecting folks to the Clues pages or Talk List?<br/>
<br/>
Y'all are my heroes,<br/>
