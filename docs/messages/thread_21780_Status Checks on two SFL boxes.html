Hi all!  <br/>
<br/>
I have attempted two boxes several times over the last couple of <br/>
weeks, with no success.  I wondered if anyone had any info on <br/>
whether the boxes were still there.  <br/>
<br/>
The two in question are both in Quiet Waters Park - "Texas Tourist" <br/>
and "Snowflakes are Falling in Florida." <br/>
<br/>
The last found date for Snowflakes is in 2003, but it doesn't say <br/>
missing or anything in the clue.  All of the others around town here <br/>
get multiple visits on the same day, and yet that one is unfound for <br/>
2 years?  Something odd there.  <br/>
<br/>
Texas Tourist was a microbox to begin with, and I think it may have <br/>
disappeared altogether. <br/>
<br/>
I have looked for both of these boxes on three separate occasions, <br/>
with two different partners.  Thanks for any replies!  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found Texas Tourist back in February, and it was a bit difficult, due to <br/>
the size.   Had to poke around a bit to get it.   I spoke to someone who tried <br/>
for it about . . . 3 weeks ago, I think, and she wasn't able to find it, <br/>
either.   Not sure if it's gone or just drifted deeper into the surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
When I was there in February, I'd intended to check on the Snowflakes box.   <br/>
I found that one in September, 2003, so I was just going to look in on it, but <br/>
they were setting up for the Renaissance Fair when I was there, and I would <br/>
have been in full view of the workers, so I wasn't able to check it.<br/>
<br/>
I do remember that one was just a bit tricky, too, though.   It took me a <br/>
couple of tries at the compass readings to get it right.<br/>
<br/>
Next time I get up there, I'll check them both, but I'm not sure when that'll <br/>
be.   It's not quite "right around the corner for me.<br/>

Very true.   I think I still have the newspaper front page from that day.   <br/>
Big bold headline.   SNOW!<br/>

Succinct, don't you think?<br/>

If it's a joke, I really don't think requiring someone spend money on entrance fees for no reason is very funny.  <br/>

It's not a joke.   It is . . . or was, at any rate, a real box.   Whether <br/>
it's gone missing or not, I don't know, but it most definitely was there.<br/>

I was joking about the box being a joke.  You know, because it never<br/>
snows in Florida.  Though it seems now that it actually HAS snowed in<br/>
Florida, but I'd still like to see some newspaper clippings to make<br/>
sure somebody's not pulling MY chain.  ;o)<br/>
