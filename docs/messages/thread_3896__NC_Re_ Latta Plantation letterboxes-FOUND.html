boxes. The Latta Plantation is a great place to spend a Sunday <br/>
afternoon. With many riding and walking trails as well as the <br/>
Carolina Raptor Center there is plenty to do. What a great idea using <br/>
scripture to "fill in the blanks" in the clues. We can't wait to hit <br/>
the trails again on our next boxing adventure. Everybody "stamp up".<br/>
