                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I'm fairly new to this.  I've found 7 boxes so far in the LA area, <br/>
and have been planning on planting a few boxes. I already have them <br/>
complete.  One question I have is how do I know where I can and <br/>
cannot plant boxes?  I've read several message postings that imply <br/>
that we can't post in national parks and such, but I haven't been <br/>
able to find any info on the types of places I should avoid so I <br/>
don't get in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
GG<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You're correct about national parks, even though I hear there are word of mouth ones.  If they are found by rangers, they won't last. And they'd better not be able to be Googled.  Nat'l forests are ok, I believe.  I understand that with a lot of parks, it may be best to not have the park name in the title so it is less easily Googled.  Private property is out.  Some cemeteries and schools and even libraries have letterboxes, but all of these spots are tricky ones.  There are some letterboxes hidden in caves, but I believe the best advice is that caves aren't a great idea-- bad air is a problem, as are the many animals who use caves for a home--bat colonies esp. should not be disturbed, and other cave animals can be dangerous.  Heavy traffic areas pose the problem of detection by the wrong people, and also difficulty stamping in discreetly.  Some planters get around the detection problem by hiding microboxes in these areas.  Other people who have planted a lot will be much better at answering this; I've only learned this by listening &amp; reading. Please correct me if I'm wrong.  I'm planning boxes too.   --lunaryakketyact<br/>
