I hope that everyone who saw my mistake will see this message.  I said something about the Pepe's interview with Legerdemaine, and that he had created lot of the design of the LbNA site.  That was wrong-- it was Der Mad Stamper who did the interview and also the designs.  My apologies to both of you, and anyone who got mislead by my error.  I don't know how I goofed that up-- I guess because I was also looking at the Legerdemaine clues on Mark's site, and the names switched in my mind.  They are both such great trail names. I only just discovered the mistake today.  Anyway, the interview of Der Mad Stamper is fascinating and I hope you'll all read it, to learn a lot about letterboxing lore and history.  Thanks again for that, and I hope you'll all forgive me for my innocent but stupid mistake-- chalk it up to newbie-ness and too much late-night stuff, I guess!  --lunaryakketyact<br/>
