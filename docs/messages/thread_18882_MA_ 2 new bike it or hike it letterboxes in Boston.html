                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've added 2 new boxes in Boston; Franklin Park in West Roxbury and <br/>
Southwest Corridor Greenway in Jamaica Plain. These 2 will companion <br/>
with my Arnold Arboretum box in Jamacia Plain, which I've also <br/>
updated and redid its map. You can bike all 3 from any of the <br/>
starting points. The Southwest Corridor Greenway is one of my <br/>
favorite urban bike trails. Well kept and it brings you through the <br/>
historic South End of Boston. A side note, please let me know if your <br/>
unable to print or view any of the maps that I've included with my <br/>
letterboxes. I've tried several different formats (jpg,gif,tif) and <br/>
would like to know which ones have the least problems. Thanks<br/>
