<br/>
Has anyone found the box in Bonelli Park, near San Dimas, CA <br/>
recently? I looked the other day and didn't find it, but the compass <br/>
I had with me wasn't very good. I also noticed that they have cut a <br/>
firebreak in the hill recently that might have changed the landmarks <br/>
some. If someone tells me its still there, I'll go and try again. <br/>
Thanks.<br/>

I recall both of Grey Squirrel's boxes did not have tupper ware containers.<br/>
They were in ZipLocks only .At her Mt. Baldy box we put the stamp and book<br/>
in a tupperware container. Think small and flat and recheck. Don<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>

&gt; I had with me wasn't very good. I also noticed that they have cut a<br/>
