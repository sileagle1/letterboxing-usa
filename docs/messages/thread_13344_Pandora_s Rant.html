   Look on the bright side, you are young and it could have been much <br/>
worse if you were much older, now you have 6-8 weeks to carve stamps <br/>
and create boxes, you learned what to carry in your pack, and you <br/>
have a great story to tell your grandchildren. (Stupid Things I Did <br/>
to Get A Silly Stamp) With time you can embellish it with wild <br/>
animals, the mtn. just grew another 50 feet, and Auntie was going <br/>
delirious from the lack of water! <br/>
   Those boxes aren't going anywhere (maybe some will go missing) but <br/>
there will always be more tomorrow then there are today.<br/>
   Hope for a speedy recovery,<br/>

&gt; Again let me say that I made mistakes during this adventure. I <br/>
should have<br/>
&gt; been more prepared, more water, better shoes, a flashlight, things <br/>
I won't<br/>
&gt; ever forget again, and I promise that no letterbox will keep my <br/>
hiking when<br/>
&gt; I know I wont have time to come down, no matter how cool it is.  &gt; <br/>
time of day, during early summer with too little water and no sun <br/>
block. <br/>
&gt;  We all make stupid mistakes; this one cost<br/>
&gt; me a broken ankle, a cast for 6-8 weeks, and a long vacation from my<br/>
&gt; favorite sport.  The saddest part of the whole thing for me is that <br/>
I am<br/>
&gt; moving to Portland to be with Iron`Bear in August, and 6-8 weeks in <br/>
a cast<br/>
&gt; means that I will probably be too busy packing when this cast comes <br/>
off to<br/>
&gt; do anymore serious boxing in California while I am here. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; So that is my little adventure.  I hope everyone takes the time to <br/>
be more<br/>
&gt; detailed with their clues and remembers poor pandora and her broken <br/>
ankle<br/>
&gt; when having fun letterboxing in the next two months <laugh><br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I bid you all well <br/>
