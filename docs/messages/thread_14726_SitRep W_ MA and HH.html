Kerr Clan at Chesterfield Gorge (great place, must join the Trustees of Reservations and support their efforts at preserving these natural wonders). Picked up the Turkey Trot Traveller HH at the Kerr Clan box. The next day we traveled to Montague and hiked up to the box at Pig Pen Ledges, nice hike, and not too buggy. Not only did we find the box but we also picked up the Massachusetts Armadillo HH. Unbelievable, it took us almost 2 years of boxing to find our first HH and now we've found 2 more on our next 2 outings! We are thinking of hanging on to these until the Wendell Gathering on 8/16.<br/>
