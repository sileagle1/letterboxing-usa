&gt; better than being asked directly.  You'd have to ask<br/>
&gt; Silver Eagle, but I'm betting his costs were covered<br/>
&gt; on the pavilion.  <br/>

I originally planned to foot the bill for the pavilion <br/>
myself ($25) since I did not want to ask people for <br/>
money, especially at the First TX LB Event.  However,<br/>
when I got there the Ranger asked me how many people<br/>
I was expecting and I told her 30 or 40, and she promptly<br/>
told me I would have to pay an extra $25.  I decided to<br/>
recoop this extra money with a donation box and it worked<br/>
great.  I thought about it later that I could have made<br/>
the donation box a sort of Letterbox with a stamp in it.<br/>
Pay a buck, get a stamp.  <br/>
Everybody that attended brought something to share and even <br/>
if no donations had been given it would have been worth <br/>
footing the entire bill for such a good time.<br/>
