letterbox is now in action where people may actually succeed at stamping<br/>
in (I hope!)<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping this time the clues are straightforward and the letterbox<br/>
should be no problem to find.  The terrain is a little iffy, but, hey,<br/>
chances are you're tough and have been through worse.  The hike itself<br/>
is relatively short and sweet.  <br/>
<br/>
I love the stamp I carved back in 2000 for this letterbox, so I'm hoping<br/>
folks will be willing to give the new clues the old college try and then<br/>
give me feedback on them and the letterbox's location.  I actually hid<br/>
the box and created the clues myself this time so the box is now<br/>
achievable - even though you still have to use a lousy compass (sorry<br/>
about that.  There was just no other way that I could do it from what I<br/>
could tell).  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and I hope you have fun seeking out this letterbox!  If<br/>
nothing else, it's a great excuse to head for the Coast (as if an excuse<br/>
for a beach trip is necessary!)<br/>
<br/>
