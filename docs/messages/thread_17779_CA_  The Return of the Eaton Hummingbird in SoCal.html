                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd like to announce the return of the Eaton Canyon Hummingbird <br/>
Letterbox.  This LB was orignally placed on 1/1/03 by twofamiles, but <br/>
was lost several months later. This was my 2nd found letterbox, and <br/>
the 1st one I ever stamped into (I found the 1st one, "The Eaton <br/>
Canyon Letterbox," a week earlier before I had a stamp). I've <br/>
recarved the stamp in the image of the 1st one (a bit bigger), and <br/>
placed it in the orignal spot, using the clues of the orignal <br/>
placers, so I don't consider this to be a new letterbox find or <br/>
placement.  The hike to these falls was taken and written about by <br/>
John Muir in the 19th century, so you'll be literally travelling in <br/>
his footsteps.<br/>
