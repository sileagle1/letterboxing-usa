Some of those ant letterboxes are tough. Molly really does help <br/>
sometimes. I have to watch here body language but she does find small <br/>
trails, sometimes slight paths to letterboxes, water, foundations, <br/>
all kinds of things. Very seldom an actual letterbox but we have a <br/>
good time. First time I went up against micro boxes were these ant <br/>
boxes. It was different. ......Chuck and Molly <br/>
