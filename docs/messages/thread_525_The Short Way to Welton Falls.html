<br/>
After last month's enjoyable but unsuccessful trip to Welton Falls, I <br/>
was eager to pay another visit to that lovely site. Instead of hiking <br/>
over Mt. Cardigan, I drove the extra 30 miles around and followed <br/>
your directions. They were very clear, and I could see that I'd come <br/>
out on the river too far upstream last time, mistaking the access <br/>
trail in your clues for another.<br/>
<br/>
This time I found the box immediately and stamped up at 8:15 this <br/>
morning.<br/>
<br/>
Your box was in fine shape, Danielle. Mine was the second stamp to go <br/>
in. No surprise whose was the first! (Trilliums have gone by, but the <br/>
stamp is still lovely)<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
<br/>
Tom<br/>
