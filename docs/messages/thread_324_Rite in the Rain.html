4 1/2" (stapled along the 4 1/2" side).  They have 24 pages.  I will be<br/>
glad to share with some of you, just send me your address and I will<br/>
mail you one.  I only have 4 so 1st come 1st serve.  The Rite in the<br/>
Rain paper in these notebooks is such that you can write on it in pencil<br/>
when it is sopping wet and it takes!!  They send you a little experiment<br/>
kit so they can prove their point.<br/>

Ps.  They will make custom notebooks.  I'm entertaining the thought of<br/>
ordering a bunch of a size that will fit in the most recent air tight<br/>
jar from American Science and Surplus.  I could shoot them out to you as<br/>
a kit and I think the cost will stay down around 2.50 with postage.  Add<br/>
to that a stamp for around 3.00 and voila, an economical letterbox!  I<br/>
have to do a little more research before I get to the point of being<br/>
able to provide a complete service.<br/>
