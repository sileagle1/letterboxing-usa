                    <div class="plaintext-content">If people wanted to have a gathering here on Mount Desert Island (Acadia) I would be most happy to help organize it.  There are some early Tom Cooch boxes here (which only appear on the old site), a few of my own and lots of Legerdemaine boxes.  There are several campgrounds and soon to be lots of tourists.  Anyone remotely interested in a Mount Desert Island gathering can be in touch with me through here.  There are also a goodly number of boxes in the midcoast area, I believe.  Though both on the coast, Acadia and Portland are a good 3 hours from one another, so would really require two different gatherings.<br/>
