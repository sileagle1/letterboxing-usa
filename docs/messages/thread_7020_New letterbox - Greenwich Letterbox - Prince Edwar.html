Greenwich, Prince Edward Island, Canada<br/>
This is a Canadian National Park near St. Peter's Bay.<br/>
<br/>
Planted by "the Family"(Yuzi, CERK, VFTR, butterbaby, spunky spaniel, <br/>
and rtrw) on August 14th, 2002. <br/>
<br/>
Time - 15 minutes<br/>
Difficulty - easy<br/>
Distance - 200 yards or less.  I never think about these things while <br/>
planting, only when typing in the clues.<br/>
<br/>
What a great interpretive center. FYI, I believe there is a $4.00 fee <br/>
per person, but totally worth it.  We were actually going to try to <br/>
get out on the trails and to the beach here, but some in the family <br/>
wouldn't have managed that much walking, so we planted close to the <br/>
interpretive center (another small fee, but truly worth going inside <br/>
for the multi media presentation alone).  A terrific facility and<br/>
well managed.<br/>
<br/>
To find the box, walk east of the interpretive center to the top of <br/>
the mound.  Spaniel and I weren't sure, but this may be their septic <br/>
system.  Find the green plastic topped access hole to whatever it is. <br/>
Take a compass reading of 340 degrees and look for the sickly reddish <br/>
 conifer.  Head toward the tree.  Southwest of the tree you will see <br/>
some birches standing guard over your prize.  Spaniel also encourages <br/>
you to wear long pants and something other than sandals on your feet <br/>
because of some prickers.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy.  We were vacationing on Prince Edward Island when we planted <br/>
this box.  Please help us keep it updated and dry as we will be there <br/>
very rarely.  Thanks in advance.  If we can help you in this or <br/>
there's something we need to know, please email us at  rtrw@attbi.com<br/>
