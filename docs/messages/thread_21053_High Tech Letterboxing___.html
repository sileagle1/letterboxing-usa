The local paper recently had an article on GeoVenture, a cell-phone<br/>
service that's currently being test in San Francisco.  Basically, you<br/>
"point and click" your cellphone at anything you want information<br/>
about and it's delivered to your cellphone.  You can get directions,<br/>
restaurant menus, movie times, etc.  The inventor was asked to<br/>
speculate about future uses of the product.<br/>
<br/>
"Or there's the treasure hunt.  You leave a message on a marked spot -<br/>
say under a tree - and when the other player arrives at the spot,<br/>
GeoVector sends a message with more directions."<br/>
