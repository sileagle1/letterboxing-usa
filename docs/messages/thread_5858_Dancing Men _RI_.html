&gt;      Amy and I found the "Dancing Men" today.  Our thanks to Wanda<br/>
&gt; and Pete for the most rewarding letterbox we've gotten to date.<br/>
&gt; Amy and Patrick<br/>
&gt;    Post<br/>
&gt;      Script: It's really cool to have found this stamp today, due to<br/>
&gt; the fact that today is our two month anniversary for having started<br/>
&gt; letterboxing!!<br/>

Yup, We received our deploma.  I was more or less where we thought it <br/>
would be.  We also did the other box (sorry I'm being vague, I'm <br/>
trying not to give anything away.)  We were going to bring Ruth, our <br/>
Black Lab. but decided [wow my spellings off today, sorry just got <br/>
off a night shift] against it due to what we where doing afterwords.  <br/>
And I'm glad, I don't think that the short bit by the train tracks <br/>
would have been good for her paws.  But oh well Amy and I got the <br/>
both boxes.<br/>
Good night/Morning....what ever time of day it is     ;)<br/>
