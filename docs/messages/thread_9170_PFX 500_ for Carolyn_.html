Very happy to hear that Carolyn Stearns' recent trip to Kentucky, <br/>
with letterbox planting along the way, has set her well over the <br/>
PFX 500 mark!!!  Carolyn, Leader of the Pack, has done so much <br/>
to promote letterboxing as a fun, friendly family activity in the <br/>
Mansfield,CT area - and beyond! The Winter Gathering she <br/>
organized in Tolland,CT on January 27,2001 was what first really <br/>
got us "hooked" on the hobby, with her warm welcoming spirit, <br/>
creative fun and games, and kind words of encouragement for <br/>
everyone! Thanks, Carolyn, for all you've done for letterboxing, <br/>
and congratulations on hitting 500! (we'll add your name to the <br/>
"PFX 500 Club" list on our web page as soon as we can!)<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to more letterboxing fun,<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete<br/>
