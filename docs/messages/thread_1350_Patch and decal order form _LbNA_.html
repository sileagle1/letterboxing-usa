                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi       OFFICIAL LbNA PATCH ORDER FORM<br/>
  We have enough interest to make bulk orders on the window decals-$4 each <br/>
and the LbNA logo patch-$2 each.<br/>
  I have attached an order form for putting on the web site.  If you can <br/>
print it and fill it out great, otherwise just write down your quantity and <br/>
total and send it to me at:<br/>
<br/>
Kay "Mohmers"<br/>
112 Dale Ave<br/>
Collinsville IL 62234  ....  Please also send a self addressed and stamped <br/>
envelope large enough to hold your order (and with enough postage too <br/>
please).  Then I can ship it back to you at no cost to me.....a big plus! :o)<br/>
<br/>
Please hold off ordering the P# &amp; F# merit badges until we can make a large <br/>
order..we don't have enough of any one patch number yet.<br/>
Please don't send the money to the address on the attached form for this <br/>
order...that is for future use.<br/>
<br/>
IT TAKES ABOUT 5 WEEKS TO GET THE ORDERS BACK!   I will make the order on <br/>
October 23rd.  That gives everybody a week and a half.   :o)<br/>
<br/>
The embroidery shop is putting together an estimate on individual patch <br/>
orders (less than 50).  The individual order patches will not be as high <br/>
quality as these bulk orders  but it might be the best way to go on the P# &amp; <br/>
F# patches.   Once I have the info I will send in an individual patch order <br/>
form for posting.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone,<br/>
Mohmers<br/>
<br/>
LAST NOTE:  I Have attached two files...one is a graphic only ....please <br/>
excuse my sheetfeed scanner and that my printer ran out of yellow ink...what <br/>
appears to be orange will be light tan on the patch.<br/>
    The other file is from HP PrintMaster Gold  ... if the web masters have <br/>
this program you can make changes to the order form as needed before putting <br/>
it on the site.....or you may choose not to use it at all...Its up to you.  <br/>
:o)<br/>
    The next two emails will have graphics of the patches attached.<br/>

<div>Kay......   Who 
should the checks be made out to?????   </div>
<div>I mail a lot of patches for my 
police and scout patch collecting. 2-3 patches can go in a business size letter 
w/ first class postage...  After that I would recommend the heavy 6x9 
envelopes with  at least .55 to a $1 postage on them for the 
return...   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I guess I will add my 
$.02  ..... Kay has put in a lot of work and effort on then patch project 
so be generous on the return postage on your envepole, so it doesn't cause her 
any more pain then necessary...</div>
