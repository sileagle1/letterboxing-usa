Hi <br/>
&gt;Kokopelli (John Chidester)<br/>
<br/>
WELCOME TO THIS GREAT AND HAPPY HOBBY FROM ACROSS THE POND...<g><br/>
<br/>
I loved your posting..so nice to see every new letterboxer on the site<br/>
saying Hi..It ceratinly cheers me up a heap to see our hobby grow.....<br/>
<br/>
I guess the answers to all your questions should come from LbNA folk in<br/>
the USA but a Brit would say "Yeah" to all of em...<br/>
<br/>
Put a name or email or whatever on your personal ..It's "YOUR" personal<br/>
stamp after all ! <br/>
<br/>
And of course ...put out boxes the way you would like to find em ! In<br/>
walks or ones ..with cryptic or plain clues ..but always with enjoyment !<br/>
<br/>
As a crazy old letterboxing Brit you are at liberty to ignore all this and<br/>
do you own thing..that is a part of the fum imvho !  <lol><br/>
<br/>
The main rule is, however, to enjoy !<br/>
<br/>
And.... I loved your lighthouses website...I am a lighthouse fan...<br/>
<br/>
They are "places at a boundary" .. and magical things always happen at<br/>
bounadries...(Wizard's Lore !<g>)<br/>
<br/>
They are at the boundary of modern technology and ancient seafaring, and<br/>
the boundary of architecture and folly ..and remote and yet so cosy...and<br/>
of course on the boundary of land and sea....Phew !<br/>
<br/>
With all those great things going for them, they are wonderful topics for<br/>
and places for hiding Letterboxes imho !<br/>
<br/>
Sadly we have closed all ours down !  <br/>
<br/>
One day I may take you up on one of your trips...<br/>
<br/>
Sincere Best Wishes !<br/>
<br/>
