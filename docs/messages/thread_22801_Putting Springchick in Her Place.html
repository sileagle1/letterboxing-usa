Can't imagine letterboxing in MI without her.<br/>
We view her as one of the best carvers/placers in the country.<br/>
Sure, she already has a place!<br/>

of the heap! She is one of the finest we've got and the state of<br/>
Michigan wouldn't be the letterboxing treasure it is if we didn't have<br/>
the likes of her in our midst. Her passion for the game is clearly<br/>
evident in her words but her contributions on the trails are stronger<br/>
still. Hail Springchick! Funhog<br/>
