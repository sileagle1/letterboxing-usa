                    <div class="plaintext-content">Is there anyone here from Alaska?  We just moved here last year and <br/>
now I've this.  What a WAY to explore Alaska!!!  But I'd like to find <br/>
out more of the terrain since we are fairly new to this.  My family <br/>
has been hiking but only on easy trails and we haven't been searching <br/>
for anything.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also still VERY confused on this whole compass issue.  I am <br/>
hoping to find a survival course being offered in town.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  email me at qvrful@saintmail.net if you are living in Alaska <br/>
or have any advice you can share with me.<br/>
