                    <div class="plaintext-content">sorry to report that the stamp for Elaine and jerry's bluff  <br/>
letterbox is missing.  Was not sure if this had already been brought <br/>
to light.  I think that it was taken on 8-12-02 judging by an entry <br/>
in the book, which still remains.  I still enjoyed the beautiful hike <br/>
and look foward to returning when the stamp is replaced (or perhaps <br/>
sooner)!<br/>
