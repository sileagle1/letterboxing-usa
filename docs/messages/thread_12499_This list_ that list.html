                    <div class="plaintext-content">     I generally try to avoid critiquing the way things are done around <br/>
here.  The people who do keep this place going are volunteering their time, <br/>
so I'm all for giving them free reign to run it as they please.  Privately, <br/>
I've expressed incredulity about how inefficient the old system was... but <br/>
it wasn't my time being wasted.  Since this is a major overhaul, I suppose <br/>
it would be a good time for me to speak up.<br/>
<br/>
     Isn't the entire notion of posting boxes to a list part of the old, <br/>
inefficient routine?  The new site is a database.  Incorporate a decent <br/>
search mechanism.  If I want to see what new boxes have been posted in the <br/>
last week, then I should be able to easily search the database.  If I only <br/>
want to see if new boxes have been planted in Maine, or some county of <br/>
Maine, in the last two days, I should be able to do that.  If I want to try <br/>
to find all of Funhog's boxes, I should be able to pull up a list of them.  <br/>
If I want to find all the boxes with the word Rose in the title, I should be <br/>
able to search for that.  A proper search engine will filter out most of the <br/>
information that you aren't interested in.  Why monitor lists?  If people <br/>
really want to do that, send them to a seperate list, and they can monitor <br/>
that, or have the email sent directly to them in real time, so they can rush <br/>
out and be the first to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
     The volume of posts to this list is already more than most of us can <br/>
keep up with, and will continue to increase with time.  There is no need to <br/>
post up boxes.  I don't think that we need to discourage it completely... as <br/>
Randy said, if you've just put out something dandy that you want to draw <br/>
attention to, then throw a message to the list directing people's attention <br/>
to the fact that it exists.  It may or may not spark discussion... but that <br/>
is the point of this list, isn't it?  There is no need to post up the entire <br/>
clue here, though.<br/>
<br/>
     Since Wes has just stated that he's isn't feeling buried, I don't feel <br/>
bad about asking that this be done.  Why have a database that can't be <br/>
searched efficiently?  It only solves one of the problems, that of <br/>
overworked webmasters manually posting up clues for the whole group.  I'm <br/>
all for sending them to the newly created list for new postings, which I <br/>
will probably never use (unless we don't get a decent search engine for the <br/>
database).<br/>

Yup! That and about 100 other to-do's are on the list of things to <br/>
do. I think you'll really be happy with how this all turns out.<br/>

I still think yahoogroup announcements are functional for some <br/>
people. Everytime I'm at a gathering, I see more yahoogroup printouts <br/>
for clues than LbNA ones. Lots of folks use them.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  Personally, I keep all my clues for MA and RI in Word files.  I <br/>
monitor the list(s), looking for posts about boxes in those states, <br/>
and append relevant information about found/missing boxes to the <br/>
appropriate clues.  That way I'm as prepared as I can be when going <br/>
to look for boxes.  It makes for fewer disappointments, but also <br/>
requires an anal retentive mind and a good chunk of time.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I shudder to imagine the amount of time it would take to keep track <br/>
of all of CT's boxes!<br/>

<br/>
Yes and no.  Simply the fact that they are posted to a list is not <br/>
necessarily inefficient, particularly if the post is auto-generated.  <br/>
People manually posting them to a list is inefficient.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
With the boxes now in a database, I agree it would be awesome to have <br/>
search functionality to drill right down to what you are looking for.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Why monitor lists?  If people really want to do that, send them <br/>
&gt; to a seperate list, and they can monitor that, or have the email <br/>
&gt; sent directly to them in real time, so they can rush out and be <br/>
&gt; the first to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
There is convenience to having new box announcements pop into your e-<br/>
mail without having to even go to the web site to look for them...  <br/>
this is especially convenient if you have e-mail access on a trip, <br/>
but not web access (i.e. on a PDA).  For some it may be to rush out <br/>
and "be the first," but I don't think that is the reasoning for most. <br/>
I do however, agree box postings/announcements should go to a <br/>
separate list.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes you don't know what you don't know... Relying on <br/>
various searches and filters increases the chance of missing <br/>
something that is identified in an unusual way or incorrectly (either <br/>
on purpose or by accident).  It also virtually eliminates the <br/>
serendipity of just happening to catch a post for a really cool clue <br/>
in a different state that you probably never would have even searched <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps there is the possibility of the best of both worlds in the <br/>
new world?<br/>
