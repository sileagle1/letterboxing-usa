 &lt;&lt; The problem is that geocachers take the stamp!  I had this problem <br/>
  when I found a geocache/letterbox in St. Louis.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 Amanda,  Sorry your hunt wasn't successful for you. :o(   .   We visited the <br/>
Forest Park Pentacache  (even though it was not hidden by us) after your note <br/>
and did find the stamp in the box but among the geocache stash items ... it <br/>
was carved on a red and yellow eraser.  <br/>
   Usually we don't loose the stamp to geocachers .... Our boxes are always <br/>
heavily laden with requests not to take the stamp ... It is for letterboxers <br/>
to stamp up with.  We have even gained quiet a few new letterboxers from the <br/>
geocache side of the hunt by hiding combo boxes.  :o)<br/>
   We have lost more contents to not properly closed ziplocks and containers <br/>
than anything else.  I think hunters should also  cnsider washing their hands <br/>
before handling a letterbox if they have just eaten or smoke, especially <br/>
cigars!  :o)<br/>
 Raccoons must love the smell of cigars!  I can count on losing a box or have <br/>
animal chew marks on it after a certain cigar smoking boxer visits one of our <br/>
boxes. :o(<br/>
