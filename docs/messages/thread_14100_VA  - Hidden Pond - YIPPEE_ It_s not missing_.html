                    <div class="plaintext-content">The day before we left for vacation, I received an email saying the three<br/>
boxes at Hidden Pond were missing! OH... stab me in the heart! Our first<br/>
plant and they were already missing! I thought about our poor boxes all<br/>
weekend, but thankfully team BeMa found all three alive and well on July<br/>
6th!<br/>
<br/>
When we placed the boxes in March the tree/bush growth was minimal. Box #1<br/>
is a bit far off the trail. The naturalist at Hidden Pond helped us find<br/>
spots for the letterboxes (NOT once did he mention "swamp<br/>
snakes"...eeeewwww).  As with anything, the more you practice (writing<br/>
clues, giving directions, placing boxes etc.) the better you become...next<br/>
time we'll place them alittle closer to the trail.<br/>
<br/>
I plan to revise the driving directions to emphasize the 2nd Greeley Blvd<br/>
entrance, it is very confusing if you're not familiar with the area.<br/>
