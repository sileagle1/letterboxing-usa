Once Upon a Time...<br/>
<br/>
Some letterboxers went out to look for a stamp.<br/>
This stamp could only be found between 10:30 AM and 7 PM on Tuesdays, <br/>
Wednesdays, and Thursdays, between 10:30 AM and 8 PM on Fridays and <br/>
Saturdays, and between 12:00 noon and 4 PM on Sundays, and it couldn't <br/>
be found on Mondays and holidays at all!<br/>
<br/>
They drove to W. Commodore Way in Seattle between 33rd Ave. W. and <br/>
Gilman Ave. W. and parked in the parking lot on the north side of the <br/>
street.<br/>
<br/>
When they got out of their car, they went down to the water and walked <br/>
east along the water where they saw some feathered friends of Jonathan <br/>
Livingston Seagull, Jemima Puddleduck, and Mother Goose.<br/>
They walked toward a ladder that people can't climb, and went up a place <br/>
where there were waves on dry land.<br/>
They found a lock that has no key, and crossed over it to a building <br/>
with three flags on it.<br/>
They went north past a sign that said "Welcome".<br/>
They kept going north, past an English garden, and through a gate of <br/>
metal.<br/>
They turned right past a little mermaid and her undersea friends.<br/>
Next to a garden of stone, they reached the end of the story.<br/>
They went in to a place where stories are found, and asked the friendly <br/>
proprietor for the letterbox that comes after the story's end.<br/>
And they lived happily ever after.<br/>
<br/>
The End<br/>
