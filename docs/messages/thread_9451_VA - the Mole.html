Hi Crickets!  I guess you do live around here - yah!  Glad you all liked the <br/>
Mole!  Playgrounds are very key!  It really ups the interest level and <br/>
(almost) reduces the whining when we hunt for boxes!  I'm so happy to hear <br/>
that people are able to figure out the mole stamp!  We are very new at <br/>
carving...<br/>
<br/>
My question is how to do the more delicate lines?  I tend to gouge a little <br/>
too much.  But, if you just cut a line with an exacto knife does it show up? <br/>
  I have the habit of going back and back to "smooth off" the edges (you <br/>
know, much like making the cut on the cake's edge straight so you are forced <br/>
to eat just a little sliver more...).  My stamps are getting smaller and the <br/>
shapes a little odder....  I don't know how people do the cool ones they do! <br/>
  Maybe I should try to reverse the technique (carve out the pattern rather <br/>
than carve out everything but the pattern).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway -- glad you had fun and thanks for letting us know!!  BeMa<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Meadowlark gardens ("Oh Deer")doesn't have a playground, but, they <br/>
have a nature center and stepping stones and other fun kid stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Wolf trap ("Curtain up") has a big hill to roll down and a stage to ham it <br/>
up on.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Today the Cricket Bros hopped over to visit the Mole.  We really liked the<br/>
&gt;Mole stamp and the park was great.  Little Red Cricket really liked the<br/>
&gt;playground and throwing abandoned tennis balls into the stream.<br/>
