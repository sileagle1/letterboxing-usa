frustrated earlier in the summer to find the box missing. Salamander <br/>
replaced it and we finally got a chance this afternoon to go and get <br/>
it. It's doing just fine now!<br/>
<br/>
We also picked up Salamnder's 'Tilting At Windmills' and 'Catwalk' <br/>
and were pleased to be first finders of both. Both are in good <br/>
shape. We were going to go after another one or two but found a <br/>
festival in full swing at Yoctangee Park. Ah well, we'll just have <br/>
to go back! :-)  Especially since she was hiding three as we were <br/>
finding three!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
