<br/>
Generally in Southern CA you can see Grey Whales from the end of December<br/>
through March.  They are at their "thickest" in February.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know where in So Cal you plan to be and I'll try and get you more<br/>
information on Boat Trips.  Also let me know if you are looking a few hours<br/>
of Whale Whatching or would like to take a week tour down to Mexico to see<br/>
the Whales up close and personal.  My sister and parents took this trip and<br/>
got to pet the whales and even the baby whales.<br/>
<br/>
We can take this off list if you like, my email address is<br/>

We will be going to So. CA over Christmas and I am wondering if that is the<br/>
time to whale watch--I know when I go at Easter it is too late. Any So.<br/>
Californian's with info? We will be in Newport Beach, so if you have<br/>
specific boat info, that would be great, too. Thanks! Cowpost<br/>
