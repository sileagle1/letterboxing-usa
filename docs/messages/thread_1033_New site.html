I found out about letterboxing from the original Simthsonian article and wrote down the how tos and then saw another article in a country magazine that had the web site. I would not have gotten involved with out the web site and the access to the clues. Just knowing about the hobby was not enough to get started, you need access to others. <br/>

Unfortunately I can barely do my own web pages let alone help with a server but if I run across anything I think might be helpful I will pass it along. Do you think we should down load everyones email address and web pages so we can keep in contact?<br/>

There should be no concern about losing any of that.  The eGroups list is totally seperate from the clues map so we should be able to communicate as long as eGroups provides this service.<br/>

OK, I will mention this one last time and then I won't bother anyone with<br/>
the offer again. I will very soon have SDSL running out of my house<br/>
(assuming no foulups by the ISP)  to host other websites that I have on<br/>
my computers. I currently have a network of Linux machines, Macs, and<br/>
even a windows box in my home office. I expect that the traffic generated<br/>
by the LBNA site would be relatively minimal. I am willing to host the<br/>
site on my machines for free no strings attached. I would find a way that<br/>
the site could be maintained by whomever the group wishes to have do such<br/>
a thing. I haven't the time or inclination to do that myself. The<br/>
letterboxing.org name is obviously owned by someone on the list and could<br/>
easlily be setup (by that person -who will continue to have all control<br/>
of the domain name) to point to the LBNA site on my apache server with no<br/>
redirects necessary. There is no problem setting up an MX record either<br/>
(that simply sends all mail to some specific mail server other than the<br/>
one where the website lives) though I could just as easily set up  an<br/>
letterboxing.org domain on my mail server with as many  users that people<br/>
would want (e.g. webmaster@letterboxing.org, whomever@letterboxing.org,<br/>
etc.). I already have the most advanced web scripting language available<br/>
on unix (PHP) and the fastest database (MySql)  installed on my<br/>
webserver, and it would be available for use on the site if anyone is<br/>
interested in learning to use it.  Oh yeah, an no advertising of any sort<br/>
would occur. If you all are interested let me know.  If not that's OK<br/>
too, I have no ulterior motives. Best wishes on whatever is decided.<br/>

Sorry to be off the list for the past week. There's been a fair <br/>
amount of 'behind the scenes' discussion as we've tried to reach a <br/>
consensus on a recommendation to bring to the list. I'm not sure <br/>
we're completely there yet, but we all feel that responses to and <br/>
involvement of the list is way overdue.<br/>
<br/>
I'm feeling very positive that Mitch is willing to stay with the <br/>
group and work together on a new site. As most of you know, our site <br/>
was located on Mitch's server (aol) from the end of last summer until <br/>
early this spring. Mitch had been heavily involved in studies and out <br/>
of touch with the group, and there was concern that the site was not <br/>
being updated. So those of us who also participate in the updating <br/>
made the decision to move the site to Randy's server.<br/>
<br/>
Mitch returned to the list in mid-May and took the discovery of the <br/>
switch very well (IMO). He had done a lot of work on the site as a <br/>
school project, and has continued to work on it this summer.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, John De Wolf, Randy Hall, and I were working to keep the <br/>
clues updated. The ultimate responsibilty now fell to Randy, as it <br/>
had previously to Mitch, since the site was on his server now. Randy <br/>
has been dealing with family illness and other demands and decided <br/>
that he could not continue hosting the site. (Despite these <br/>
pressures, he has continued to particpate in the discussions and is <br/>
our major source of technical expertise. Without his advice, we would <br/>
very likely be making some second-rate decisions right now).<br/>
<br/>
Seeing our current uncertainty, and given the elegant and up-to-date <br/>
status of his site, Mitch might have decided to go on his own. But he <br/>
recognizes that we need a site that permits an increasing larger <br/>
number of people to be involved in its upkeep. A single person right <br/>
now could do it - working very hard! If the number of letterboxers <br/>
continues to grow as we hope, it will be impossible for any one <br/>
person.<br/>
<br/>
We also see that there are servers out there better than aol, which <br/>
would really let the site reach its full potential. So that is what <br/>
we need to decide on now.<br/>
<br/>
This brief (?) recapitualtion may be have been unnecessary, but I <br/>
don't know how many people on the list may have been following along <br/>
regulalry the past year.<br/>
<br/>
One of the factors that has delayed my own posting to the group is <br/>
that I was waiting to meet with a lawyer to specializes in non-profit <br/>
corporations. I wanted to know what our legal position would be if we <br/>
set up a new site that required asking people for money. Would we be <br/>
obliged to incorporate? Would we have to acquire that status before <br/>
we registered a new site? We probably could have gotten that <br/>
information from expertise on the list, but I felt more <br/>
comfortable consulting someone in person.<br/>
<br/>
The results were very encouraging. Briefly, he thinks we are in good <br/>
shape as far as exposure to liability for letterboxing accidents <br/>
goes. And he advises strongly against incorporation. I am going to <br/>
post the points he made in greater detail in a different e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
Over the past two weeks there have been lots of excellent <br/>
suggestions and offers of help. Thank you all very much. We will <br/>
certainly be looking for the help with updating the new site once <br/>
it is established.<br/>
<br/>
Eric Mings has made a very generous offer to host the site for free <br/>
on his server, and a lot of list members have voiced their <br/>
thanks. I add my voice to theirs. Some of the behind the scenes <br/>
discussions have involved bringing up past disagreements with Eric <br/>
and how relevant those are to our choice. The other primary <br/>
consideration is technical - whether Eric's site would meet all our <br/>
needs. When we put in the effort to move everything to a different <br/>
location, we want to try to make sure we do it right.<br/>
<br/>
If we decide for either reason not to take advantage or Eric's offer, <br/>
the funding of a new site should not be a problem. Several people <br/>
have offered to contribute $50 to $100, which would certainly get us <br/>
started. I'm guessing that we asked if some people on the list  <br/>
could contribute $5 or $10 a year, we would get enough positive <br/>
responses to get the $300 - $400/year we need.<br/>
<br/>
Eric, regardless of which way our discussion and decision go, I am <br/>
glad you are back into letterboxing. Thank you for the offer.<br/>
<br/>
I am leaving on vacation with my family for a week this morning - to <br/>
a place where there is no e-mail. (How long will such Shangri-la's <br/>
exist??) I feel a little like Snagglepuss (?) saying 'Exit .... Stage <br/>
Right!'.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

&gt; Sorry to be off the list for the past week. There's been a fair <br/>
&gt; amount of 'behind the scenes' discussion as we've tried to reach a <br/>
&gt; consensus on a recommendation to bring to the list. I'm not sure <br/>
&gt; we're completely there yet, but we all feel that responses to and <br/>
&gt; involvement of the list is way overdue.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm feeling very positive that Mitch is willing to stay with the <br/>
&gt; group and work together on a new site. As most of you know, our site <br/>
&gt; was located on Mitch's server (aol) from the end of last summer until <br/>
&gt; early this spring. Mitch had been heavily involved in studies and out <br/>
&gt; of touch with the group, and there was concern that the site was not <br/>
&gt; being updated. So those of us who also participate in the updating <br/>
&gt; made the decision to move the site to Randy's server.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mitch returned to the list in mid-May and took the discovery of the <br/>
&gt; switch very well (IMO). He had done a lot of work on the site as a <br/>
&gt; school project, and has continued to work on it this summer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Meanwhile, John De Wolf, Randy Hall, and I were working to keep the <br/>
&gt; clues updated. The ultimate responsibilty now fell to Randy, as it <br/>
&gt; had previously to Mitch, since the site was on his server now. Randy <br/>
&gt; has been dealing with family illness and other demands and decided <br/>
&gt; that he could not continue hosting the site. (Despite these <br/>
&gt; pressures, he has continued to particpate in the discussions and is <br/>
&gt; our major source of technical expertise. Without his advice, we would <br/>
&gt; very likely be making some second-rate decisions right now).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Seeing our current uncertainty, and given the elegant and up-to-date <br/>
&gt; status of his site, Mitch might have decided to go on his own. But he <br/>
&gt; recognizes that we need a site that permits an increasing larger <br/>
&gt; number of people to be involved in its upkeep. A single person right <br/>
&gt; now could do it - working very hard! If the number of letterboxers <br/>
&gt; continues to grow as we hope, it will be impossible for any one <br/>
&gt; person.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We also see that there are servers out there better than aol, which <br/>
&gt; would really let the site reach its full potential. So that is what <br/>
&gt; we need to decide on now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This brief (?) recapitualtion may be have been unnecessary, but I <br/>
&gt; don't know how many people on the list may have been following along <br/>
&gt; regulalry the past year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the factors that has delayed my own posting to the group is <br/>
&gt; that I was waiting to meet with a lawyer to specializes in non-profit <br/>
&gt; corporations. I wanted to know what our legal position would be if we <br/>
&gt; set up a new site that required asking people for money. Would we be <br/>
&gt; obliged to incorporate? Would we have to acquire that status before <br/>
&gt; we registered a new site? We probably could have gotten that <br/>
&gt; information from expertise on the list, but I felt more <br/>
&gt; comfortable consulting someone in person.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The results were very encouraging. Briefly, he thinks we are in good <br/>
&gt; shape as far as exposure to liability for letterboxing accidents <br/>
&gt; goes. And he advises strongly against incorporation. I am going to <br/>
&gt; post the points he made in greater detail in a different e-mail.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Over the past two weeks there have been lots of excellent <br/>
&gt; suggestions and offers of help. Thank you all very much. We will <br/>
&gt; certainly be looking for the help with updating the new site once <br/>
&gt; it is established.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Eric Mings has made a very generous offer to host the site for free <br/>
&gt; on his server, and a lot of list members have voiced their <br/>
&gt; thanks. I add my voice to theirs. Some of the behind the scenes <br/>
&gt; discussions have involved bringing up past disagreements with Eric <br/>
&gt; and how relevant those are to our choice. The other primary <br/>
&gt; consideration is technical - whether Eric's site would meet all our <br/>
&gt; needs. When we put in the effort to move everything to a different <br/>
&gt; location, we want to try to make sure we do it right.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If we decide for either reason not to take advantage or Eric's offer, <br/>
&gt; the funding of a new site should not be a problem. Several people <br/>
&gt; have offered to contribute $50 to $100, which would certainly get us <br/>
&gt; started. I'm guessing that we asked if some people on the list  <br/>
&gt; could contribute $5 or $10 a year, we would get enough positive <br/>
&gt; responses to get the $300 - $400/year we need.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Eric, regardless of which way our discussion and decision go, I am <br/>
&gt; glad you are back into letterboxing. Thank you for the offer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am leaving on vacation with my family for a week this morning - to <br/>
&gt; a place where there is no e-mail. (How long will such Shangri-la's <br/>
&gt; exist??) I feel a little like Snagglepuss (?) saying 'Exit .... Stage <br/>
&gt; Right!'.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best wishes,<br/>
