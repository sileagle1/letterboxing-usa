Pig, Flying Pig, Ramblin' Rose and the Spirit of Aloha. The months passed and almost <br/>
no one ever emailed me as to their whereabouts. A few of their stops have been <br/>
recorded on Pete and Wanda's webpage but personal messages were nil. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, immediately after comiserating with fellow letterboxers about our <br/>
incommunicado hitch hikers, I got an email from, Trail Turtle. Not only was I informed <br/>
that Ramblin' Rose was in his/her possession but I was given a complete rundown of <br/>
its travels over the last couple of years. Way to go, TT! This is how I always thought <br/>
hitchers would work... Funhog<br/>
