                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
As Deborah said, I did find the Turville Pt. Letterbox and send back one of <br/>
her WAY COOL postcards.  The view from the site is great, though I could not <br/>
stay long.  It was quite cold and threatening to rain :(  On the up side, my <br/>
sister-in-law, who resides in Madison, was eager to join in the Letterboxing <br/>
phenomenon as she is already a rubber-stamping enthusiast.  (Matter of fact, <br/>
I'm sure she even has a Pooh stamp.  What's the copyright policy on those if <br/>
Disney itself is selling them?)  Furthermore, I'm sure to be spending much <br/>
more time in Madison, as I was also there over Halloween to see my newborn <br/>
baby niece (and future Letterboxer!)  Hopefully by the time she's old enough <br/>
to comprehend it all there will be more than a few Letterboxes across the <br/>
country.<br/>
The Letterbox at Cave Point was also found recently, but by a friend of mine <br/>
who was testing my clue for me.  He started from the Letterboxing USA web <br/>
site and followed through from there.  Alas, he had no stamp, but he did say <br/>
it was a fun experience.  He's moving to Florida in a couple of weeks, so <br/>
are there any Letterboxes in the Tampa area?<br/>

Deborah's comment leads me to ask: <br/>
Can I claim my works as original pieces of art if I created them using rubber<br/>
stamp impressions, and some of the stamps I used had copyrighted characters on<br/>
them? (whether store-bought or handmade)<br/>
<br/>
Pooh or No Pooh, maybe we should consider using rubber stamp images for<br/>
graphics on the web pages?  This would be a great way for some of the stamp<br/>
artists in the group to contribute to the site.  It would be very appropriate<br/>
to the hobby and would be a great way to promote interest in the carving<br/>
aspect of it.  We could print the fact that the graphic on the page was an<br/>
original hand-carved stamp image and give credit to the various artists for<br/>
their work.<br/>
<br/>
I can see two possible methods for dividing up such a project among several<br/>
artists, if any should volunteer to participate:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Each artist could do a scene comprised of various stamp images. Each scene<br/>
would be the focus of one page on the website.  In a recent post, I mentioned<br/>
four possible scenes (counting the map) that would be useful in creating a fun<br/>
online adventure.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Each artist could make a stamp (or two) of one assigned character. Then<br/>
the images of these characters could be combined to form the scenes for the<br/>
website.<br/>
<br/>
    Any Comments?<br/>
         Any Volunteers? - - -<br/>

You hold copyright on the composition but not the images which are already<br/>
copyrighted.  So even though the composition would belong to you you<br/>
wouldn't have the right to display it or sell it without permission from<br/>
the manufacturers of the images you used.  I think Deborah already<br/>
explained about angel companies.<br/>
<br/>
I really don't have an opinion one way or another about whether or not to<br/>
use Pooh, or animals or whatever for the kids.  They're not likely to<br/>
notice or even care about the time, thought and effort that went into<br/>
choosing the characters.  I take that back, I have one small opinion that<br/>
I've been reluctant to bring up because it's really not that big of a deal.<br/>
 I have a 7 year old daughter who won't hesitate to tell you that Winnie<br/>
The Pooh is for babies.  She likes Pooh, she has nothing personal against<br/>
Pooh, but I'd better not dare buy her Pooh jammies or clothes because "Pooh<br/>
is for babies and she's not a baby anymore".  Now, she's not yet into that<br/>
Spice Girls thing (thank you, God) but the Rugrats or Wishbone are way<br/>
cooler than Pooh.  Do any of you know who Wishbone is?  I think an animal<br/>
character like that, not necessarily a dog, but I think an animal dressed<br/>
in Sherlock Holmes type clothes carrying a magnifying glass might be fun<br/>
and might appeal more to the age group that's likely to "get" letterboxing.<br/>
 Pooh is loved by preschoolers but realistically your average 4 year old is<br/>
probably not going to take an interest in this.  Down here they teach basic<br/>
map skills starting in first grade but it's all still quite confusing for<br/>
my daughter so I've had a hard time getting her involved.  I'm just a<br/>
thinkin out loud....<br/>

<br/>
A magnifying glass or a compass or both might be good additions.  The Sherlock<br/>
Holmes image brings to mind for me those foot-prints... that I suppose may be<br/>
leading up to a letterbox??  I don't know.  The foot-prints may imply that you<br/>
are looking for a suspect whereas the box was really put there by a friend who<br/>
intends for you to have fun.<br/>
Still I like the idea of the inspector and perhaps by finding each subsequent<br/>
box the inspector may get more clues to finding a friend<br/>
rather than a suspect??  Wouldn't this be a rather optimistic change<br/>
from the usual reason to seek out clues?  The difference here is that the hider<br/>
of the box WANTS you to find it.  But the suspect does NOT want you to find what<br/>
he is hiding...<br/>
<br/>
I don't think the kids really need to wonder what dangers may be lurking in the<br/>
box, rather they should be concerned about what dangers there may be in<br/>
stumbling on a rock while looking for the box - because that is very real. <br/>
While we are designing (hopefully) pleasant surprises in our boxes it is always<br/>
possible to stumble while looking for them and perhaps there should be pitfalls<br/>
in our themes that reflect that reality.<br/>
<br/>
But the real danger is to not have fun.  So if the secrecy aspect can be woven<br/>
into a fun theme that is not too overwhelming for children I'm all for it.  I<br/>
think a compass and a map designed by a friendly person who's been there will be<br/>
good imagery for them in addition to some optimism about what is at the other<br/>
end.  While the box may be an unknown you still hope for a fun surprise in it. <br/>
It is always put there by another fun seeker who wants you to have fun also.  I<br/>
guess that's where I think we should take the Kid's stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Just thinking out loud here...<br/>

<br/>
any "derivative" work of art, that is, art you create using another<br/>
copyrighted image, must be derived from your own work, or you must obtain<br/>
express permission from the owner of the copyright of the image. In other<br/>
words, if they didn't say you could do it, you can't.<br/>
