letterboxing in!  Happy to report that the Disney series of three <br/>
boxes are all still alive and well.  However the two listed for Bok <br/>
Gardens are nowhere to be found.  An indentation under the palm was <br/>
there but no box and the second we did find the log as well.  The <br/>
park is landscaped and tended very carefully so they were probably <br/>
removed by one of the gardeners. : (<br/>
<br/>
Also - we tried for Sebastian but the community is now gated during <br/>
the day as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Did pick up the Lone Star HH at Carribean Beach, Disney and will <br/>
plant that in the VA area soon.<br/>
<br/>
Back to letterboxing in VA!<br/>
