is an indoor variation on a letterbox. First attempted by the Kimball Library
in Randolph, Vermont, letterbooking struck the Local History/Genealogy

(Central Library of the Onondaga County Public Library in downtown Syracuse,

find a stamp, a stamp pad and notebook. Clues, supplied below, will enable
you to determine on which floor the book is hidden, and then to discover
the book itself. 1.

<div>Per the instructions at <a href="http://www.leterboxing.org">www.leterboxing.org</a>, the Local

<div>Letterbook Clues</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In this library (Central Library of the Onondaga 
County Public Library in downtown Syracuse, New York), is a book that has been 
hollowed out. Inside the book you will find a stamp, a stamp pad and notebook. 
Clues, supplied below, will enable you to determine on which floor the book is 
hidden, and then to discover the book itself. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>1. If it's reality you're looking for, come visit

<div>2. With liquid thoughts, powered by stubborn

<div>3. East to west, through local towns, they traveled 
not on solid ground.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>4. From lower to higher and back again, this device 
a hand did lend.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>5. Both thermometers and stocks, both emotions and 
tides; this common thread cannot hide.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>6. In song as children we sang this ditty, now 
heads go down or it will be a pity.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please note: Treasure hunters are asked to be 
discreet and not disturb other library patrons. You may wish to use CoolCat, the 
library's computerized catalog, or ask a librarian for help in locating specific 
books.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hurrah! Congratulations! You have found the OCPL 
letterbook!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please sign the notebook found in our letterbook 
and include the date and time the letterbook was found. If you have your own 
personal stamp, please stamp our notebook too. If you have your own notebook, 
you will want to stamp your book with our stamp hidden inside the book. This 
could be the first of many future letterbooks. Watch our Web site for 
details.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for participating. We hope you enjoyed the 
hunt.</div>

your clues this week-end.</div>

<div>I will also (happily) change the line in the
