Subject: [LbNA] Making Rocks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I first joined this list a couple years ago,<br/>
there was a discussion about making rocks to hide<br/>
boxes in.  I can't even pinpoint a rough idea of the<br/>
month that discussion happened in, so would someone<br/>
indulge me and tell me what the process was for making<br/>
rocks?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

What's important to you? What kind of impression ( pardon the pun) do you want to leave with people. Do you have any hobbies? anything that would look really nice as a stamp? For me my personal stamp was easy, I'm a juggler so my stamp should be of a juggler. It took 2.5 hours to carve and was worth every minute of it. When I stamp in I know I'm leaving a piece of who I am at every box I've visited. I feel your personal stamp should also be the nicest one you've carved, of course you should do your best on all stamps that you're placing in boxes for others to find, but knowing you're leaving a great stamp for others really feels  good, like you're giving them a brief glimpse of who you are and what you're all about. Maybe I'm over romanticizing this whole thing and probably not making it easier for the two of you to decide on what to carve. Worst case scenario, you carve something now and decide to change it later. My first stamp paled in comparison to what I have now, but it was a<br/>
 place to start and I liked it at the time. You don't have to be stuck with only one personal stamp. It's too late and I'm rambling on and on and on and on......................Good luck with the decision making and the carving. Let me know what you decide on, I'd be interested to know. Who knows, someday you might see my stamp in one of your logbooks or vice-verse. Take care, happy hunting.                                                                                                                                 <kccreations1@sbcglobal.net>  Gooble Gobble  <br/>

My kids and I found our first letterbox last night.  What a thrill! <br/>
We were in such a hurry to get started that we very quickly carved<br/>
designs in erasers.  Mine was a picture of a bead because I'm a<br/>
lampworker (I make glass beads).  My kids did a cat face, a frog face,<br/>
and a planet.  All designs were very rudimentary, I'm afraid.  My<br/>
kids' are cute the way they are because they are childlike, but I<br/>
think I'll have to perfect mine and spend a little more time with it,<br/>
but it's a place to start and I didn't want to get so hung up on<br/>
perfection that I never go out and actually leave my stamp in a<br/>
letterbox.  I've been known to be paralyzed by perfection in the past.<br/>
