                    <div class="plaintext-content">The "Desperately Seeking Sun" gathering at Highland Forest County Park near Fabius (Syracuse) was a great success despite the cockeyed weather pattern.  The event was planned for possibly seeking letterboxes in the surrounding woods on XC skis or snowshoes, but a warm period (50's)midweek removed all of the new snow base accumulated the week before.  It seemed that the event needed to be renamed, "Desperately Seeking Snow"!  Then, as the day arrived, the big wind blew in cold and snow.  <br/>
Much of the time was taken up quite pleasantly by exchanges and  potluck dining, but some brave solls ventured out in the 10-degree cold and wind for the hunt.  Kudos to Lock Wench, who worked so hard to prepare and advertise the event.  May there be another !<br/>
