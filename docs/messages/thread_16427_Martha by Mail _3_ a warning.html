She immediately began to rave about how beautiful my halloween decorations were until she realized that the dust and cobwebs were real (yikes, letterboxing isn't the only thing I'm lazy at!).  She was only appeased when I offered to host a gathering in her honor.  She threw herself into making the refreshments while I organized as many local letterboxers as I could find. As I drove her to the post office afterward I thought, "whew, prepare yourself Tempus Fugit!"<br/>
