I'm not arguing with this comment, I agree with it.<br/>
<br/>
But in the case of your Superstition Letterbox, I've always thought<br/>
that that page was a perfect example of warning people about what they<br/>
are getting into... you warn of the time required, that it's important<br/>
to ensure you turn around and be off the mountain by dark, the<br/>
temperature, the altitude change, bringing water, poisonous reptiles,<br/>
etc.  You went above and beyond the call of duty on that page,<br/>

<br/>
I *think* it's the Superstition Mountain SW Quadrangle, but<br/>
unfortunately most of my maps are currently in a moving truck.<br/>
<br/>
As long as they don't give away too much info, I think that USGS<br/>
quadrangles are a great idea.  And for some letterboxes (but not<br/>
most), I'd even say that giving GPS coordinates isn't bad.  I've done<br/>
a few letterboxes where I knew more or less *exactly* where the box<br/>
was before setting out, but actually getting there wasn't so easy...<br/>

It will be sad to see Weiss Ecology go.  I was happy to be the first to<br/>
find it, and it was one of my favorites.  There is something special about<br/>
the glaciated northeastern terrain, especially in the fall, when I went.  <br/>
I guess I just thought that if my preparation underestimated the hike, <br/>
I would simply turn around.  On the bright side, perhaps the stamp will<br/>
be worth a mint someday due to its rarity ... :)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, If you feel like planting a similar letterbox, please e-mail me the <br/>
clues off-list :-)<br/>
<br/>
No matter where you draw the line, someone will cross it, and if you <br/>
require times, the next fellow will be asking for elevation gain, and <br/>
if you require that, perhaps the next fellow will be asking for a field<br/>
guide to the species of endemic venomous moths, and perhaps even if that<br/>
is required, some idiot will still cross the line without a proper <br/>
butterfly net :-)  (and please flame the Paisley Orca, not me ;-) [standard<br/>
disclaimer - the preceeding parenthetical statement was a "joke", you<br/>
can never be too careful, it seems on these matters])<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is the story on my hiking boxes.  I have taken the clues down<br/>
temporarily to add further information.  Since the hike itself is the point<br/>
of the box I dont feel that adding times, distances, etc,  is a big problem.<br/>
The point is that it has become clear to me that people are willing to take<br/>
risks that I did not predict when I made the original clues and since some of<br/>
my boxes are on fairly unforgiving territory I want to ensure that the old<br/>
clues are not passed around.  Although I am a Darwinist I dont really want<br/>
some poor fool dying of exposure searching for a silly rubber stamp (my art<br/>
work isnt that great).  It will take me a few days to collect the information<br/>
and add it to my website.  I have broken the links to the boxes and will<br/>
restore them as I finish with each clue set.  Please do not pass on any of<br/>
the old clue sheets to others.<br/>

I'm glad to see that you get my point.  Actually, I realized as I <br/>
hiked through Norvin Green it would have been great if I could have <br/>
taken my time on a clear day.  I'll probably go back.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not a great supporter of Darwin.  We had an old saying among <br/>
scout leaders:  the best way to keep the troop together on the trail <br/>
is to put the slowest kid in front.  All this rugged individualism <br/>
isn't doing our society much good.<br/>
<br/>
