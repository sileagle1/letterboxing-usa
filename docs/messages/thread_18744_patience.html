i have been reading these posts for a couple of weeks now, had to write and<br/>
say how much i enjoy it all. being a newbie (ouch it hurts to say that) i<br/>
was not quite sure if i was following all the proper etiquettes. i must say<br/>
i was quite surprised at the posts that mentioned finders not rehiding the<br/>
boxes well. ummm....is it just me or does it kinda seem that not rehiding a<br/>
box well defeats the purpose and spirit  of letterboxing? <br/>
<br/>
while i am here i must say how much i admire you planters in the desert<br/>
regions. being from new england i can see thousands of thousands of places<br/>
to hide. recently i had the pleasure of going through new mexico and arizona<br/>
and tho i was only able to do 1 letterbox in each state i was struck by the<br/>
barren landscape and how difficult it must be to find a good accessible<br/>
location to plant. my deepest regards to you desert wanderers!<br/>

Don't forget - we were all new letterboxers once, no matter how long we<br/>
have been doing this tupperware-hunting thing of ours. You may be new to<br/>
this pastime - but you possess the wisdom of an elder!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
