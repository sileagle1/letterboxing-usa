will hit the gather on the way down or back. Would like time to do a <br/>
couple boxes too will have some others with me don't know who will <br/>
travel with me but some of my family. We would love any  spot. If my <br/>
daughter comes I'm sure she will want to catch some activity at the <br/>
Parkettes gym in Allentown too. ( She is an avid Gymnastics fan - <br/>
they are Olympic level coaches) All those boxes sound so inviting! <br/>
I'm thinking of what to bring and what to leave behind...... Never <br/>
can  have enough boxes can we!  Maybe this trip I will get my <br/>
lancaster County box out too.  Always so hurried.  Carol- Leader of <br/>
