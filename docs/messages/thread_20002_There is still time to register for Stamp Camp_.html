<br/>
When: August 27-29, 2004<br/>
Where: Battle Ground Lake State Park, Battle Ground, WA.<br/>
<br/>
   Come out and spend a weekend camping or come for the day on <br/>
Saturday. There will be workshops on Letterboxing 101, Stamp <br/>
Carving, <br/>
Book Binding, Jr. Ranger Program and Camp Crafts for the kids as <br/>
well <br/>
as many letterboxes in the area to find! Visit <br/>
http://www.parks.wa.gov for information on campsites, directions to <br/>
the park and other things that the park has to offer while you are <br/>
there. <br/>
   Each person attending will be given a Passport that will include <br/>
pages for your personal stamp and information, a map of the park, <br/>
clues to letterboxes in Battle Ground Lake Park only (you will need <br/>
to bring the clues for letterboxes at Lewisville Park and Yacolt if <br/>
you plan on searching for them while at the Stamp Camp), a complete <br/>
schedule of events and pages for the images of the MANY event stamps <br/>
and letterboxes that you will find at the park. This passport will <br/>
also make a great keepsake after the event.<br/>
   There will be some awesome letterbox items raffled off at the <br/>
event. Raffle tickets are $1.00 each or 6 for $5.00. Kid's raffle <br/>
tickets will be free.<br/>
   When you arrive, everyone including the kids will need to "check <br/>
in" at the Passport to Letterboxing Stamp Camp check-in table <br/>
located <br/>
at campsite # 14 to receive your passport and information about the <br/>
event.  If you are attending on Saturday only please arrive any time <br/>
between 6:30 am and 9:30 am to check in and be there in time for the <br/>
first workshop.<br/>
   Please bring your carving tools if you have them, starter kits <br/>
with carving tools will be available for $5.00 each if you would <br/>
like <br/>
to purchase them at the event, a hitch hiker if you would like to <br/>
participate in the Hitch Hiker Hostel hidden in the park, your own <br/>
firewood if you will be camping (the park does not provide <br/>
firewood), <br/>
your own meals since this will not be a potluck event, your <br/>
letterboxing supplies and plenty of cash for the raffles and the day <br/>
use fee of $5.00 if you are not camping out. Please do not bring <br/>
extra letterboxes or hitch hikers to leave on the tables. <br/>
   Your hosts for this event will be Camp Fire Lady, Iron Bear and <br/>
Pandora, Maiden and Bookworm.<br/>
   Look for the red signs with the red, blue and green balloons that <br/>
will direct you into the park from the I-5 freeway and we will see <br/>
you there at the Passport To Letterboxing Stamp Camp at Battle <br/>
Ground <br/>
Lake State Park, Battle Ground, WA.<br/>
Please R.S.V.P. to Camp Fire Lady at tinarie at msn dot com if you <br/>
plan on attending this event so that we can make sure that we have <br/>
enough supplies for everyone.<br/>
