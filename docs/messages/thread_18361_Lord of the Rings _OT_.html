<br/>
    In the first book, Fellowship of the Ring, in the chapter The Council of Elrond, Gandalf says he went to Orthanc to consult with Saruman (not knowing he'd gone over to hte bad side).<br/>
"But I rode to the foot of Orthanc (Saruman's tower), and came to the stair of Saruman; and there he met me and led me up to his high chamber.  He wore a ring on his finger."<br/>
    All the other rings were accounted for, and Saruman knew better than to accept a dwarven ring, so I figure he made one to be like the Big Bad guy.<br/>
<br/>
    So it doesn't have much to do with letterboxing, just a shameless plug for reading books.  No movie could do true justice to these particular books without being a week long.<br/>

  I don't want to fill up the talk list with LOTR chatter and get yelled at, just one quick question. I began reading the books in 1972 and have read them at least 10 times. I know the kings of men, dwarf kings, elves (Celeborn and Galadrial) had rings but I don't remember reading that Saruman had one as well. Neither did Elrond I believe. Is that correct or am I really getting as old as my kids say I am?!<br/>

  In the Elder Days we used to read the books.  *sigh*<br/>
  The ents are still missing their entwives (though the location of them is hinted at in the books, for the alert reader).  You could plant the entwives and have them get 'found'.  And what ever happened to Saruman's ring?  Is it in the Shire?<br/>

    I am working on a series dedicated to the Lord of the Rings.<br/>
    I have already carve the "One Ring", Gollum,  and Minas Tirith.<br/>
    My oldest daughter (the big fan in our family. She saw Return of the King 5<br/>
    times) did a simple LoTR stamp.<br/>
    I may do one more.<br/>
    These will find a park somewhere in Eastern PA where I can watch over them.<br/>
<br/>
    I think someone else did a series in Western PA, but pulled them recently.<br/>
    I don't care if there is an LOTR stamp in every state.<br/>
<br/>
    Go for it.<br/>

    Has anyone done a Lord of the Rings letterbox?  Perhaps a stamp of a sword<br/>
    or the ring of power?<br/>
