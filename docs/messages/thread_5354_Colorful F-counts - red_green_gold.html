happy responses to Saturday's wonderful CT Gathering at the Sleepy <br/>
Giant and was simply amazed to find even more comments on F-counts! <br/>
What a fiesta of focus, both "on" and "off"-target (and color,too!)<br/>
Between the golden bright threads of friendship, the blushing red <br/>
roses, and the distant stares of green-eyed monsters, you guys are <br/>
certainly helping to keep our world colorful! Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Personally, this past weekend we too preferred to concentrate on our <br/>
X-count rather than our F-count, and managed to increase the former <br/>
by meeting and greeting a whopping 34 fun new letterboxers! Of <br/>
course, glad as we were to see some of our old friends, it would <br/>
never have crossed our minds to recount people we had already met, <br/>
just as we would never have even thought( before Randy mentioned it!) <br/>
of counting a hitcher again if we had already found it before!!! So <br/>
please lighten up, Randy et al. with the f-counting rules, and try to <br/>
come out and join us sometime on the golden highway, if you ever can!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Wanda      P33 F1072 X163          (and,yes, I really did once when I <br/>
was very young have a little yellow chair named "Manners the Butler", <br/>
but I think it drowned in our skating pond forty odd years ago!)<br/>
