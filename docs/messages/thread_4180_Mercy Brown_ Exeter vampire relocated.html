                    <div class="plaintext-content">First of all, thanks to Laurette Vitello and family for doing a <br/>
little extra searching after finding Mercy's original spot had been <br/>
excavated and tossed over the stonewall. They sent Mercy back to me, <br/>
unscathed, so I could relocate her. I do hope that some of you who <br/>
would like to visit her will still take the time to check out the old <br/>
Historical, 1838, Chestnut Hill Baptist Church and the actual Brown <br/>
Family burial site, but before heading out I suggest you also grab <br/>
the Kurdziel families Knight at Dawn and Mummies in the Morning and <br/>
their Crossing Over cluesheets for an afternoon of letterboxing fun. <br/>
You'll take them and head to the Fisherville Brook Wildlife Refuge. <br/>
Take Rt. 102 in Exeter, R.I., to Widow sweets Road, (4 miles east of <br/>
Rt. 3, 3.2 miles west of Rt. 2) Follow Widow Sweets to Pardon Joslin <br/>
Road, bear left and continue to the refuge. The trails here are all <br/>
clearly marked and easy to follow. Depending on how many boxes you'll <br/>
be hunting, your hike will be anywhere from 1 mile to perhaps 5 miles <br/>
if you choose to do both sides. At this time a total of 5 boxes are <br/>
hidden on this property.<br/>
To find Mercy, from the parking lot you'll cross Pardon Joslin Road <br/>
and look for the trail heading west.(left) Continuing on this trail, <br/>
eventually you will come to a bench that marks the separation of the <br/>
trail. You'll want to continue straight ahead, on the outer loop <br/>
trail. After crossing a footbridge, begin looking on your right <br/>
through the woods for a stone wall. A little farther up the path <br/>
you'll find an unmarked trail on your right. Take the unmarked trail <br/>
until you locate a rock outcropping just to the right of the trail. <br/>
