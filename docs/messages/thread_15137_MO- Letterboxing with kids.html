                    <div class="plaintext-content">I made my kids their own stamps (3 1/2 and almost 11 months) and we went on <br/>
our second letterboxing adventure yesterday.  At Burr Oak Woods in MO, Miss <br/>
Kitty hiked the whole 1.5 mile Habitat trail and we found both boxes in <br/>
great shape and a male 5-lined skink basking on the trail!  She was pretty <br/>
tired at the end, and so was I with the bear cub in the backpack, but we <br/>
had a lot of fun!  Thanks to the Shorewood Folks for planting LBs in one of <br/>
our favorite parks in the area!  Maybe this weekend we can go for the <br/>
Bethany Falls LB with Daddy.  BOW just added a new bird-watching solarium <br/>
to the nature center, a nice place to rest after the hiking or to plan your <br/>
outing and visit the restrooms and fill water bottles before setting out.<br/>
<br/>
Our letterboxing stuff (stamps, ink pad, log book, extra ziplocks) fit in <br/>
our diaperbag/backpack that I normally carry and the hiking stick stays in <br/>
the car anyway with the stroller and baby backpack<br/>
