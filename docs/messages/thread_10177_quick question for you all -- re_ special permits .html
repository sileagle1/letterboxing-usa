I am going to the park office at Fort Worden tomorrow and would like to be able to say that I could get people to click an "I agree" button before accessing the clues to the web site. The agreement would be to follow the rules associated with letterboxing in the park. <br/>
<br/>
I imagine it would be something along the lines of Leave No Trace, and I Promise to Be Careful. I am thinking that if they want to explain the rules of the special activities permit to me, then the people hunting for the boxes would need to be aware of them, too. <br/>
<br/>
Would you go that extra step? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks. <br/>
