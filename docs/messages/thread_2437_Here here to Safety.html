&gt;Real good points by all, but really sad if the truth be told.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am working on a disclaimer to put on my clues. Goes something like this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;CAUTION: Reading the following clues and attempting to find my letterbox is<br/>
&gt;dangerous and could result in mild headaches, sneezing, drowsiness, sore<br/>
&gt;throat, nose bleeds, loss of hearing, loss of sight, loss of limb or limbs,<br/>
&gt;injuries due to animal bite, insect bite, falling rocks, falling limbs,<br/>
&gt;falling man made devices from the sky, escape convicts, rapist and child<br/>
&gt;molesters, brain damage, fetal damage, genetic damage, sexual dysfunction,<br/>
&gt;loss of appetite and or death.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Or I might just keep it simple with this one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;CAUTION: Attempting to find one of the following letterboxes will more than<br/>
&gt;likely result in your DEATH.  YOU SURELY WILL DIE!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Okay, still a bit rough on the edges but I'm getting close!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;Glenn<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;CAUTION: I really hope I haven't offended anyone. If I have take heart. <br/>
&gt;Soon<br/>
&gt;their will be laws to protect people like you from people like me.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You're still not getting my point!  How can you guarantee that<br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone who pulls clues off the internet has one of your workshops<br/>
&gt; &gt; under their belt.  Everyone keeps talking about their own personal<br/>
&gt; &gt; safety procedures and that's great, but you're  missing what I'm<br/>
&gt; &gt; getting at.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Let me draw an analogy.  If this site were dedicated to some form of<br/>
&gt; &gt; sports hunting and our dialogue concentrated on different places<br/>
&gt; &gt; where the hunting was good, we'd be pretty much protected from<br/>
&gt; &gt; liability (unless we advocate breaking the law) since anyone who<br/>
&gt; &gt; wants to hunt almost always has to take a hunter safety course which<br/>
&gt; &gt; includes some wilderness survival and safety tips. Therefore, they<br/>
&gt; &gt; should know better.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There's no qualifications to go letterboxing.  There's nothing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; stop a totally inexperienced person who basically doesn't know enough<br/>
&gt; &gt; to realize how little he knows from striking out, printout in hand,<br/>
&gt; &gt; into the woods and a situation he can't handle.  Can you be sure that<br/>
&gt; &gt; he's going to read through this whole list and get every piece of<br/>
&gt; &gt; your good advice before he sets out?  Why do you think that product<br/>
&gt; &gt; labels are so packed with instruction and warnings.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm sure that all of the dedicated letterboxers are no fools when it<br/>
&gt; &gt; comes to how to conduct themselves in the woods.   Something as<br/>
&gt; &gt; simple as stating estimated travel time should be possible without<br/>
&gt; &gt; spilling the beans.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For experienced people, it's sometimes a hassle to deal with rules<br/>
&gt; &gt; and regulations that are meant for less experienced people.  However,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the slight inconvenience of adding some extra details to the clues is<br/>
&gt; &gt; a lot better than having to have a qualification course and passwords<br/>
&gt; &gt; to access the clues.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; You should see the "junk" in my backpack. If I ever get stuck on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; trail we are in great shape. I think this is especially important<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; when you hike with kids. They feel temp changes, wetness, cold, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; always hunger  worse than adults. We keep a spare sweatshirt, my<br/>
&gt; &gt; size<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; its o.k. if its huge and warm on him. Dried fruit, trail mix ,fruit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; by the foot snacks are all great in the backpack. I have a full<br/>
&gt; &gt; first<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; aid  kit which was a gift from my daughter. Wouldn't you know the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; first hike with it one of the kids fell and got scraped up. We had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clean bandaged knees in no time and the patient loved holding the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; kits and seeing all the cool stuff inside while I fixed the knees.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The cell phone and kids knowing how to use it are great too.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course I carry things for letterbox firstaid too, spare bags a<br/>
&gt; &gt; box<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; whatever I have extra at the time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;    When I do workshops for kids we always cover the safety side of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing. Thanks to forester for bringing up the topic again so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we keep it fresh in our mind.    Leader of the Pack - Carol<br/>
