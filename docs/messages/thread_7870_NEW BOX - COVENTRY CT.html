The story of the CT Charter is one of the most intriguing pieces of CT<br/>
history. On October 9, 1662 (340 years to when this box was planted) the<br/>
General Court of Connecticut won the charter from King Charles II, thanks to<br/>
the diplomacy of Governor John Winthrop, Jr. Twenty-five years later, Sir<br/>
Edmund Andros, his Majesty's agent, arrived in Hartford with an armed force<br/>
to seize the Charter.<br/>
<br/>
Picture it, a candlit room with the charter laid out in the center of a<br/>
table. For hours there is debate and raised voices when suddenly the room<br/>
goes dark! When the lanterns are relit the charter has vanished!!<br/>
<br/>
Capt' Joseph Wadsworth is credited with having removed and hiding the<br/>
Charter in the majestic oak on the Wylly's estate. The mighty oak fell<br/>
during a great storm on August 21, 1856. People collected souvenirs of<br/>
acorns and bark. The oak tree we are in hunt of today is said to be an<br/>
actual descendent of the original Charter Oak Tree that once protected our<br/>
State Charter.<br/>
