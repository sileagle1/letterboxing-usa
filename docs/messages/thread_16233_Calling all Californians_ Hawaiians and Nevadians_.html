<br/>
The current poll indicates that the people want Region #2 (California, Hawaii and Nevada) added to the database, with Region #1 (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington). So, here we go!  <br/>
<br/>
It's going to take a little bit of programming, as California has 58 counties, Hawaii has 5 and Nevada has 17, with all the associated cities, but, it'll be fun!  (For you, not for me!)<br/>
<br/>
What I'm asking for here is for those of you that reside in these states that want to, come on over to the website and join up and get ready for the beta testing.  Take a look around and lets make this site the best!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing you there!<br/>
