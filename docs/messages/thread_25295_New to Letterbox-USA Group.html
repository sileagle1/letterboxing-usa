Just wanted to introduce myself and get familiar with Yahoo, which I've not used in many years.<br/>

I recently visited my parents in Southern California and found an old Smithsonian magazine with the article "They Live &amp; Breathe Letterboxing" and here I am, after finding you at the LBNA site! <br/>

Can't wait to catch up on what this group is doing and learning everything I can. At the same time, it's incredibly bizarre to find myself so intrigued and drawn in to Letterboxing....it even feels like finding an old lost friend, like I was meant to do this all my life. I'll never forget those initial moments reading that article.<br/>

I must sound loony, but I'm sooooo excited to start this! <br/>

There is also a Yahoo list for Southern CA<br/>

&gt;hi Jill, I just thought your comment (the part I selected above) was so typical of what I and so many others felt at our first exposure to letterboxing.  Now 7 years later for me I can say I have made some wonderful close friends and countless aquaintances, all of whom have something in common with me, something clean, healthy, and so fun.  So welcome to it, hope to meet you on the trail sometime.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'll second (or third) these comments!  We immediately loved the idea as soon as we heard about it and after we started, we laughed about playing "Secret Agent Man".  8 years later it is a regular part of our life.  We just got back from a great trip out to Montana/North Dakota/South Dakota/Wyoming and not only enjoyed many hikes to find boxes, but had a chance to meet another great letterboxing friend (check out Half Empty's clues if you want to see some creativity!  Examples:  Cursed, Dowsing Rod, Zzzzzz)<br/>
