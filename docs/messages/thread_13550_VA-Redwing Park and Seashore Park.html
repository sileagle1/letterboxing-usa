                    <div class="plaintext-content">     I am very very new to letterboxing though I first read about it in the <br/>
Smithsonian Magazine many years ago. I thought it was only an England hobby <br/>
until just a few months ago. <br/>
     I was sooooo excited I bought a stamp so I could try this. I am not an <br/>
artistic person at all. My family reluctantly joined me in my first quest. <br/>
     We started with the simple "Little Diva" but could not find the box. <br/>
Okay, so we tried the next one. We spent a considerable amount of time looking <br/>
for a metal bridge (which we later found out was dismantled). Could not find <br/>
"Garden Gnome II." We then proceeded to look for "Redwing Park II." I was so <br/>
excited when we actually found a box since to this point I was beginning to think <br/>
I fell for some wild joke. To our dismay, there was no stamp inside. I was <br/>
sure we were supposed to find one in the box. There were notes from disgruntled <br/>
people. They too were frustrated about the metal bridge. <br/>
     So.... 2 weeks later near dusk (I was obsessed with this now) we headed <br/>
to Seashore State park. We ran out of time for The "Witch of Agnesi" box but <br/>
did find the clues listed for the first one "Ovals of Cassini". After scramble <br/>
through the debris for 15 minutes my children began complaining of the <br/>
mosquito's. My husband and I gave up and left the park. <br/>
    Has anybody found these boxes lately? Are they still there? I am now <br/>
planning to try some of the Norfolk boxes. I am also going to bring clues with me <br/>
on our vacation. <br/>

Karen and I were down that way in the first week of May, and this <br/>
what we found:<br/>
<br/>
At 1st Landing/Seashore State Park in Virginia Beach: Fox Run, Long <br/>
Creek Seahorse, and the Witch of Agnesi were all found in good <br/>
shape. Ovals of Cassini, Hot Spot, and Broad Bay Shells seemed to be <br/>
MIA.<br/>
<br/>
We also stopped by York River State Park in Croaker: The York River <br/>
(Cardinals Rule), Taskinas Creek, and Pupa boxes were all found in <br/>
good shape. Mattponi Trail LB was MIA.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

Thank you very much K&amp;K. I plan to let my family know that there was not a <br/>
box at Ovals of Cassini and convince them we should try some others. <br/>
<br/>
Apparently, I need to check the archives first. I did not realize that. I am <br/>
always so hesitant to write to lists like this. I should have gone on my first <br/>
instinct. I appreciate your patience in responding to my question. I did not <br/>
mean to be redundant.<br/>

You're more than welcome.  Please don't hesitate to ask the group <br/>
about their experiences concerning particular boxes (i.e., <br/>
found/missing/relocated/under repair/etc.).  I've only been <br/>
particpating in this group a little while, myself, but I get the <br/>
impression that the vast majority of people who correspond truly <br/>
enjoy helping each other out, exchanging news and gossip, and <br/>
generally just being nice people.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, just because Karen and I couldn't find the boxes I <br/>
mentioned, it doesn't mean that they are necessarily MIA.  I think <br/>
nost letterboxers have had the experience of finding a box that <br/>
someone else has previously flagged as "missing".  Frequently, the <br/>
hike itself is worth the effort to locate a box, even if you suspect <br/>
it might not be there.  Karen and I have been to a number of <br/>
beautiful parks and loctions that we never would have gone to if we <br/>
hadn't been searching for boxes...I think in letterboxing, the <br/>
journey itself is half the fun.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, and good luck in your future hunts.<br/>
<br/>
  Kim &amp; Karen<br/>
