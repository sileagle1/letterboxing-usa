Madison, CT<br/>
<br/>
This is a very short woodland walk (half hour, less than one mile) on <br/>
the Bauer Farm property in Madison, CT. There is currently lots of <br/>
controversy in town over whether playing fields should be created on <br/>
this land. At present there is a woodland trail, pond wetland trail and <br/>
community gardens. Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
Location: From Exit 61 in Madison, head north .1 mile on Route 79. Take <br/>
a left onto Hunter's Trail. Proceed (less than 1 mile) to the end; turn <br/>
right on Copse Road and park in the community gardens parking area on <br/>
the left (you will see the sign board).<br/>

Bauer Farm Pond Letterbox.<br/>
Cross Copse Road and begin at the Woodland Trail trail sign. Walk over <br/>
2 planks and then bear left. Pass the poison ivy tree and the "siamese <br/>
tree" on your left. Follow to the right over 3 more planks and then go <br/>
right when you reach the pond for a counterclockwise loop. Stop at the <br/>
bench. It's been a short walk so you may not need a rest, but check out <br/>
the woodland pond (a trout farm experiment in the 1960s, but the water <br/>
was too warm). Check behind the American Beech for your treasure! <br/>
Continue your counterclockwise loop, crossing the Munger bridge (over a <br/>
tributary of the Neck River), dropping below the pond's edge for part <br/>
of the trail. When your circuit in compete, cross the plank bridge and <br/>
re-join a familiar trail for the short trek back to the trail entrance.<br/>
