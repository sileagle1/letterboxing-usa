                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't think it matters really, Squirrel. I'm hoping to get the info <br/>
one way or another. When I hear that a hh box has been found, I'll <br/>
fill in the ??? for the previous location, and put up the name of the <br/>
new finder, with ??? for the new location until that is reported.<br/>
<br/>
If I find that there simply isn't enough info coming in from any <br/>
source on the boxes, I may give up trying to track them in such a <br/>
detailed fashion, and opt for Jay Drew's approach on his own <br/>
hitchhiking page - he simply lists the known host boxes for the <br/>
hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me that I have data on some boxes that has come in over <br/>
the last week which I haven't posted. I'll try to that this <br/>
afternoon.<br/>

&gt; Hi guys,<br/>
&gt; I was just wondering what are the steps to be taken for the hitchiker boxes? I have 2 that were posted on the web page with ??? for location. Now if someone one finds it and moves it to another locat&gt; Thanks,<br/>

Now if someone one finds it and moves it to another location, what happens? Do they tell me and I then request that the location that I put the box at be posted as well as the name of the person that found it or does the person who found it do that?<br/>

I guess I'd reply, No, I don't think so.<br/>

&gt; out of the game?  It seems the best way to get (and track) the details <br/>
