I am back. I'm sure there are a lot of new faces on the scene, but<br/>
some of you old crusty dogs may still be out there in boxing land.<br/>
Hopefully for good this time. I needed to take a nice long break from<br/>
everything.<br/>
<br/>
I am saddened to say the Mr,. or Ms Potato Head in East Boothbay, ME<br/>
is no longer findable. Unless you are insanely persistent. I hadn't<br/>
checked up on it in 2 years. *Gasp* because every time I was home it<br/>
was hunting season. Not a good time to be walking around.<br/>
Unfortunately, I just checked it today and they have done so much<br/>
trail work, and so much has changed that the clues are useless. I will<br/>
leave them up for persistent souls who like a good challenge, but do<br/>
me a favor and don't bring your kids. I don't want to be responsible<br/>
for heartbreak. I'll put some new ones out today though, to make up<br/>
for it. <br/>
<br/>
OK. I can promise I probably won't post much and will mostly lurk, but<br/>
I am here. I am in Maine for now, but will be moving back to<br/>
Boston/Cambridge very soon. Maybe I'll even be social and attend a<br/>
gathering... all these Maniac boxers up here keep trying to get me to<br/>
go to one and I haven't been in about 2 years. <br/>
