                    <div class="plaintext-content">First let me thank Eric Ming for his funny response to the Florida <br/>
letterboxes. I enjoyed that, and it is good to see a sense of humor expressed.<br/>
<br/>
Well, here are my thoughts on the recent discussions.<br/>
1. I'm not a big fan of chat rooms and don't really have time for them. So I <br/>
am neutral about that.<br/>
<br/>
2. Missing box: If I get a report about a missing box I try to check it out <br/>
if not I amend my clues to say that "the letterbox has been reported missing <br/>
but not confirmed" and leave the clues up. I also try to hide two boxes in an <br/>
area so if someone bothers to go look for it at least one will probably still <br/>
be there to find and it gives incentive to look for the possible missing one. <br/>
If several people look and it is still missing I will either take the clues <br/>
off the web site or state that is has been confirmed missing. <br/>
<br/>
There was a letterbox in Delaware I wanted to search for  and had made plans <br/>
to look for but did not get around to it. Later I found out it was missing <br/>
and changed my plans. I was very glad that I did not go looking for a missing <br/>
box. I like to have at least a fighting chance to find it rather than go on a <br/>
wild goose chase. <br/>
<br/>
At one point I looked for a letterbox and was not successful in finding it <br/>
and emailed the creator who checked it out and rewrote to clues to give the <br/>
correct bearing. In that case the clues were wrong and I went back later and <br/>
found the box. The point being communication between the seeker and hider are <br/>
essential espicially if you are the first to look for the box. And it is the <br/>
responsibility of the creator to keep the web page up to date.<br/>
<br/>
So on Eric Mings page stateing a box is missing I believe that would be fine <br/>
but only the creator can declare that, not a seeker.<br/>
<br/>
3. One thing mentioned that no one seemed to pick up on was posting a "last <br/>
date found" I think that would be helpful for all. As a seeker it would give <br/>
me some idea if the box is still there and as a creator it would give me some <br/>
idea if the box is still there, espicially those  I planted far from home. <br/>
<br/>
4. The degree of difficulty issue. I think the clues speak for themselves. I <br/>
do like to know the mileage and terraine difficulty because that affects my <br/>
ability and decision to look for a letterbox so I assume when some one gives <br/>
their letterbox a difficulty rateing it is about the terraine. Mileage would <br/>
also be helpful to judge time and difficulty and if you need to take a lunch <br/>
along. Anyway that should be up to the creator to post on their websites and <br/>
hopefully they will. <br/>
<br/>
So those are my thoughts, have a Happy Thanksgiving, I am thankful that you <br/>
have all contributed to this fun new hobby. We need each other to do this. So <br/>
I honor and respect each of you.<br/>

Interesting.  I know a box like this.  A bearing was wrong by <br/>
180 degrees.  I spent a real long time looking in the wrong place. <br/>
Then by luck tried the bearing in reverse and found it.  I don't <br/>
remember if I was the first there, but I know from either this <br/>
list or personal communication or stamps in the log that the<br/>
box was found by others as well.  Should I have contacted the <br/>
author?  Was this part of the puzzle or a real error?  I just left <br/>
things alone under the Prime Directive :-)  Interesting nonetheless ...<br/>
<br/>

We found a box like that only because the compass bearing listed did not make<br/>
sense ie, it put the seeker over the edge of a cliff.  We were not the first<br/>
to find the box though.  Personally the most irritating (no pun intended) set<br/>
of directions we have encountered sent the seeker through a patch of poison<br/>
ivy.  Perhaps the box was planted in the "off" season when the owner was not<br/>
aware of the presence of poisonous plants.<br/>

This mistake can easily be made when someone tries to write clues backwards.  <br/>
In other words, they start at the destination, and write clues back to a <br/>
starting point. All readings must be adjusted by 180 degrees (subtract the <br/>
reading from 360) in order to work for someone who is working their way from <br/>
the starting point to the letterbox.<br/>
