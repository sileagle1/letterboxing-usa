&gt;  It's wonderful seeing your stamps on the trail, Pete and Wanda!<br/>
<br/>
It's wonderful being on the trail in search of Jay's super stamps!<br/>
Over the weekend, we enjoyed his latest, Salmon River Troutbox, in <br/>
CT and later a delightful triple (3 stamps = 1 big image) at Sin and <br/>
Flesh Brook in RI.<br/>
<br/>
In between those adventures we visited Selden Creek and became a bit<br/>
puzzled by finding two boxes both labeled Carolie's Bench Letterbox.<br/>
Apparently the original box got "lost" and was replaced last summer, <br/>
but then someone realized what they had and now the original is back<br/>
in its original home under the edge of the large flat rock to the south<br/>
of the bench.  Stamped into both Carolie boxes, old and new; does this<br/>
count as a find of two?    :-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, we found the BACKPACKER hitch hiking at Mercy Brown, Exeter, RI<br/>
awhile ago and it is now elsewhere looking for company on the trail.<br/>
