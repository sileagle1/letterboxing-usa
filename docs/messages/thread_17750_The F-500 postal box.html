Just a reminder about the 'Milestone' Postal boxes. The F-500 is with me waiting to hear from the next person that qualifies and wants it. If you have found 500 or more letterboxes and want this postal commemorative stamp, please EMAIL ME DIRECTLY BECAUSE I DON'T READ THIS LIST ANYMORE. DogScouts at hotmail dot com<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows the location of the P-100 &amp; F-100 postal boxes, please let me know. If you qualify for those and want to get them, you can let me know. They are open lists, so when you reach any of the above goals, just email me your address DIRECTLY at: DogScouts at hotmail dot com and I'll let the current holder of the box know that you want to get it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
