out letterboxing in East Lyme, Waterford and Stonington yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
We found the "Red Dragon" letterbox.  Great park -- great spot.  <br/>
Box has been heavily visited in the last couple of months.  Log <br/>
book is almost full, and the red ink (pigment) pad has come <br/>
unstuck from its holder -- makes for a mess using it.  Site would <br/>
benefit from a visit by its owner for those reasons. Wish we'd had <br/>
time to look for the Drew clan's Resolution the same day!<br/>
<br/>
We had no success with "The Wall" letterbox in Waterford.  Although I <br/>
think we interpreted all of the clues correctly, and believe we found <br/>
the described spot.  However, unless we are crazy, the wall in that <br/>
area is completely underneath poison ivy vines!  No way were we going <br/>
to investigate further.  At any rate, the box seems to be on private <br/>
property?  I'd be glad to correspond privately with the box's owner to <br/>
see if we were on the right track.<br/>
<br/>
We also visited the Seaside letterbox in Stonington, but no dice.  All <br/>
bearings seemed accurate, the description seemed correct, but there <br/>
was absolutely nothing there.  The hiding spot is definitely at least <br/>
splashed by water at some tides!<br/>
