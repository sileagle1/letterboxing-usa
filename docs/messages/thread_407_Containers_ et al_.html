                    <div class="plaintext-content">I still have about 60 of the American Science and Surplus containers of the size 3 1/2 X 3 1/2".  Also have about 10   of the size 2 5/8<br/>
X 5 5/8".  These are not quite as wide as the other ones but they are a little more durable.  I don't see these breaking or allowing in any moisture.  Well, if you're interested let me know and I will send you one or two of 'em (maybe one of each).  The latter one is opaque, the other one is clear.<br/>
<br/>
I've been wondering if there is something like an electronic bulletin board that you could use to say, create a rubber stamp template.  Several companies will give you an outlandishly low price if you order (red rubber) stamps on a big sheet like 10 X 10".  I don't think it costs very much at all to order 'em that way, then cut 'em out and<br/>
mount 'em yourself.  I'd be willing to give this a try if others are interested in it.  I bought a postal scale so I can mail things out at a reasonable rate, so its no problem getting things to you once I have the right stuff lined up for ordering.  I hope we'll have a kit or two (maybe a small container and a large one), maybe a small size for a stamp and small notebook_only and then maybe a larger size container to hold prizes, post cards, patches, doggie biscuits, etc. in addition to the basic two components.  I've also wondered if there should be a mini-size one to contain a stamp_only.<br/>

Any other ideas?<br/>

I decided to sign my name this way when mailing out to the main list now because there are a few new people showing up on it every week these days. There are now 62 people on the list, up from 55 last month.<br/>
<br/>
Tidbit:<br/>
For those of you who may not know you can send a note to this list by clicking on the mailbox in the upper left corner of the web page at<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/  or  http://www.pclink.com/elf/  or<br/>
http://david.snu.edu/~dwilliam.fs/letbox/<br/>
<br/>
Don't be afraid to introduce yourself if you are new.  We have a welcome wagon list also.  I will paste it at the end of this note.  If you want to be on it let me know.  It may be a way to get in touch with other letterboxers in your area (although there are other ways to do that too).  It may also be a way to let people know that you<br/>
have some talent or skill, or to find other people who have some particular talent or skill (who's brain you need to pick perhaps?).<br/>
<br/>
In our group we have everything from hikers to bikers to harley riders and from college professors to artists to animal trainers.<br/>

This is interesting..<br/>
I remember, bak a few months ago, someone has a source of a very<br/>
inexpensive "postmark" style stamp, i.e., text around a circle, but no<br/>
"image" as part of it. I think the style of stamps with the circle of<br/>
text and a graphic inside are really nice as a format. <br/>
<br/>
What if the part inside the text circle was left full height (printing a<br/>
solid circle surrounded by text when received by the manufacturer, then<br/>
an image was carved into this red-rubber circle?<br/>
<br/>
Voila: cheap stamp, good text, hand-carved aspect as well. Does anyone<br/>
know if red-rubber stamp material will also carve well?<br/>
<br/>
Also:<br/>
Does anybody know of a waterproof clear wide tape?<br/>
I typically add a label on the letterbox cover, printied on a floppy<br/>
disk label, and cover with clear package sealing tape. Over time, this<br/>
tape starts to pull up along the edges. I've not yet lost a label, but<br/>
it is only a matter of time.<br/>

<br/>
I was going to suggest packaging tape because I think its pretty durable<br/>
but since you've already tried that you'd need another option.  Perhaps<br/>
taping the label on the inside of the container facing out?  Is your<br/>
container transparent?  Even if its opaque this may still work if you<br/>
use large lettering on your label.  Just a thought...<br/>

<br/>
Here's another thought about that.  I used a permanent marker, and just<br/>
wrote<br/>
my info on the lid (on my Split Rock Lighthouse letterbox).  The brand<br/>
is<br/>
Pilot - ultra fine point - permanent - SCA-UF (No Xylene).  This ink<br/>
will<br/>
not weather away and it will take to any kind of plastic container, even<br/>
glass i think.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to try it, I will mail one to you.  Just let me know.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dan mentioned carving on a factory-made rubber stamp, and someone else <br/>
mentioned carving on a "mirror block" stamp.  I do have experience cutting <br/>
rubber stamp material, so I thought I'd throw in my comments.  I say <br/>
"cutting" rather than carving, because that's what I did.  I cut up some old <br/>
rubber stamps and glued the pieces together to make a "recycled" stamp.  <br/>
Crude but effective.  I bring this up to make a simple observation:  most <br/>
commercial rubber stamps are made of very tough stuff.  It takes a very sharp <br/>
knife to even cut it.  Even then, you end up using your blade like a saw <br/>
rather than a carving tool.  When possible I used a sharp pair of scissors, <br/>
but even this was a struggle.  My hands ached for days.  Carving in this <br/>
medium does not sound fun to me.  Take my advice... stick to soft stuff like <br/>
erasers, foam, and carving blocks.<br/>
<br/>
I like Erik's idea of using two or more stamps to make an image.  This <br/>
allows...<br/>
(1)  More than one color<br/>
(2)  Mixing hand-carved elements with manufactured ones<br/>
(3)  Creative license for those who want to arrange the stamps on their page <br/>
in an unusual manner<br/>
<br/>
I'm reminded of an item I saw in Miller &amp; Thompson's "The Rubber Stamp <br/>
Album".  It was a US flag stamp made of two parts.  You stamped the stripes <br/>
part in red ink and the stars part in blue.<br/>
