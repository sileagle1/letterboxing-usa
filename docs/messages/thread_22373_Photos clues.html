                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, as long as we have room in LbNA group, you can put <br/>
your photos there. You can use another website to host the <br/>
pictures on the internet then use an HTML <img/> link in <br/>
your clues to display the photo.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you that aren't familiar with HTML, a link in <br/>
your clues to a photo looks like this:<br/>
<img <br=""/>
src="http://us.f1.yahoofs.com/groups/g_1114407/__hr_Example+of+Bad+Letterboxing!.jpg?bc4j37CBSE0GmQcw"&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I got the stuff in quotes by right clicking on the photo <br/>
that I was viewing in Internet Explorer after it was <br/>
uploaded and selecting Copy Image Location from the menu.<br/>
<br/>
There's a good primer on puting images on web pages here:<br/>
http://www.htmlgoodies.com/primers/html/article.php/3478181<br/>
<br/>
Susan was refering to an option to upload a photo for a <br/>
letterbox directly to letterboxing.org. W experimented <br/>
with this ability recently but decided to disable it.<br/>
