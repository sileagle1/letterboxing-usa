<br/>
Where: Near Yellow Springs, Greene County, Ohio<br/>

Life was a little simpler than the rush of today.  At least it looks <br/>
that way from our vantage point.  Computers were not yet part of <br/>
science fiction.  Science fiction was Jules Verne.  Structural wood <br/>
was still cheaper than structural steel.  Buildings, fences, and <br/>
bridges were almost all made of wood.  <br/>
<br/>
But bridges needed to remain strong with the passing of heavy wagons <br/>
pulled by horses and later tractors and trucks.  Paint was not enough <br/>
protection for the bridge structural members from the ravages of <br/>
weather.  So roofs and sides were put on wooden bridges  to keep them <br/>
dry.  <br/>
<br/>
In the late twentieth century, many of these bridges were replaced by <br/>
steel or by concrete bridges.  In a few cases money was available to <br/>
move the wooden covered bridge to a park or somewhere it might be <br/>
appreciated.  <br/>
<br/>
To find this bridge, use a topographic or road map to find Grinnell <br/>
Road just outside Yellow Springs.  A couple hundred yards north of <br/>
its crossing the Little Miami River, on the south-west side of the <br/>
road is a turn-off where you can park.  <br/>
<br/>
If you desire a GPS coordinate, it is N 39 deg 47.120 min W 83 deg <br/>
52.607 min.  <br/>
<br/>
The bridge is across a field at a heading of 250 degrees.  The length <br/>
of the bridge is 24 of my paces.  Enjoy the babbling of the brook <br/>
under the bridge.  Try to ignore the graffiti left by this <br/>
generation's vandals  not that this is the first to deface these <br/>
beautiful bridges.  <br/>
<br/>
Keeping going absolutely straight up the hill in front of you a total <br/>
of 38 paces.  At the foot of the two honey locust trees (big thorns) <br/>
the letterbox lies under two or three stones. <br/>
