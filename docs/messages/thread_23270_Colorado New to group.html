<br/>
Just started  letterboxing again. Found my first one in 4 years. I <br/>
forgot how much fun it is. My dog goes with me now. And i actually had <br/>
to wait for people to leave to get this one. <br/>
<br/>
I use to place them. But found I was to busy to keep thme up. So now I <br/>
just search. <br/>

Letterboxing talk list: <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RMLetterboxing/ it might be a little <br/>
more specific to your geography.  We're a nice group of <br/>
letterboxers - a little obsessed with pie - but nice.<br/>
