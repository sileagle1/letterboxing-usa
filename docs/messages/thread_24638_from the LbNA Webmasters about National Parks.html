Message: <br/>
Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I am a law enforcement ranger at --name removed-- National Park. I <br/>
am contacting you in reference to a letterbox listed in your --name <br/>
removed-- section called --name removed--. This box was placed <br/>
wtihin the boundaries of --name removed-- National Park, where <br/>
letterboxing/geocaching and other similar activities are not <br/>
allowed. I have removed this box from the park and contacted the <br/>
placer to let him/her know that I have it. I told them they could <br/>
email me and I would mail it back to them, but I think they are <br/>
afraid I will also send them a citation. That is not my intent. <br/>
<br/>
I would like to spread the work to folks who are interested in <br/>
letterboxing and other GPS-related activities that they need to <br/>
check with each individual National Park to find out what their <br/>
rules are. The National Park Service does not have a uniform policy <br/>
to cover all 390+ sites in the Service - each park makes that <br/>
decision based on the types of resources in each park and the <br/>
reasons why the park was established. Due to the sensitive <br/>
archeological nature of --well, you get it by now-- National Park, <br/>
we do not allow any of these activities (except for those <br/>
involving "virtual" caches). Anyone interested in placing a <br/>
letterbox on National Park property should contact the Park to find <br/>
out if it is possible. Some parks that allow letterboxes and <br/>
geocaches are actually using them as part of their interpretive and <br/>
educational programs.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help in getting the word out. And if you can <br/>
contact --that crazy letterboxer--, tell them I'm still holding the <br/>
letterbox in case they want it back - no harm no foul.<br/>
<br/>
