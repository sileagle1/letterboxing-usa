near you, It is the silhouette of Nancy Drew!  And being such a big <br/>
mystery fan, I could not let the Murder in Gabriel Park go unsolved <br/>
for long!<br/>
<br/>
Ryan only gives you 2 clues to get you started, and then it is up to <br/>
you to find the possible 6 letterboxes in the area which contain <br/>
pieces of evidence to convict the murderer!<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, I found all 6 pieces of evidence. So it can be done!<br/>
<br/>
It was a lot of fun trying to figure out where the boxes might be and <br/>
what they might contain!  The park itself is a small little park in <br/>
Portland and a mecca for dogs and their owners.  I highly recommend <br/>
this letterbox hunt.  Especially to those who enjoy a good mystery.<br/>
