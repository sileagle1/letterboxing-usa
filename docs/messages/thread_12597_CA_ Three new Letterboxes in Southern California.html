(Altadena, California)<br/>
<br/>
Placed by:  Buzzard<br/>
Placed on:  5/1/03<br/>
Location:  Altadena, California in Los Angeles County<br/>
Distance:  Approximately 1.5 miles<br/>
Difficulty:  Moderatethe park is located in a rugged wilderness <br/>
area, and you'll be traveling a little ways off the main trail, <br/>
sometimes up some steep hills, so very small children and strollers <br/>
are definitely out. Older children who don't mind walking through the <br/>
brush should be fine when accompanied by an adult (I don't have much <br/>
experience with children, so let me know if I'm wrong here).  These <br/>
are my first planted Letterboxes, so please keep me informed of their <br/>
condition at trentlaudes@excite.com.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
These boxes are located at the Eaton Canyon Nature Area in the city <br/>
of Altadena (north of Pasadena). For specific directions, go to the <br/>
park's website at http://www.ecnca.org.  Admission is free and dogs <br/>
are allowed on a leash.  I suggest you stop at the Eaton Canyon <br/>
Nature Center for a map of the canyon, and to learn about the history <br/>
of the park and the local San Gabriel Mountains.  The nature center <br/>
map is not created to scale, but it does roughly indicate the <br/>
locations of the canyons where these letterboxes are hidden.  Because <br/>
the paths to two of these letterboxes travel up dry streambeds, you <br/>
shouldn't attempt this hike during the rain, or at any time there <br/>
might be rain in the San Gabriel Mountains.  Be very careful of the <br/>
poison oak, which is endemic to Southern California's mountains (you <br/>
could fittingly change this park's name to Poison Oak Canyon).  If <br/>
you don't know what poison oak looks like, get the Oak Terrace Self-<br/>
guided Nature Trail pamphlet from the Nature Center, walk to the Oak <br/>
Terrace trail located near the center, and go to Stop 1.  At the time <br/>
of this writing, there are two other known letterboxes in the canyon <br/>
planted by other letterboxers:  the Eaton Canyon Letterbox, and the <br/>
Eaton Hummingbird.  I suggest you pack a lunch, bring water, and <br/>
spend the day exploring Eaton Canyon and racking up letterbox <br/>
stamps.  These letterbox clues are given in series order.<br/>
<br/>
#1.  Meadow Letterbox<br/>
Walk through the parking lots to the yellow gate at the north end.  <br/>
Walk past the gate and follow the main path past several picnic areas <br/>
and downhill across a creek bed.  As you walk up from the creek bed, <br/>
you'll come to the main trail marked by a signpost reading "Eaton <br/>
Canyon Trail" (don't be confused by an earlier signpost).  At this <br/>
point you have three choices of direction:  You can turn left and go <br/>
west (the most popular choice), and follow the main trail to the <br/>
beautiful Eaton Falls and several other letterboxes.  You can turn <br/>
right, but this trail just curves around back across the creek.  Or <br/>
you can go straight, which is north, directly towards the mountains<br/>
this is the correct choice.  Head north on this path about 100 feet <br/>
until the trail ends at a "T" in the road.  Turn left at the "T" and <br/>
walk another 100 feet to a fork in the trail; at the fork, turn <br/>
right, and at a compass heading of 40 degrees (northeast) follow the <br/>
trail directly towards the mountains.  There are a couple of rough <br/>
paths that branch off from this main path, but stay on the path that <br/>
travels northeast, directly into the canyon in front of you.  Follow <br/>
this path through the meadow, enjoying the wildflowers, for about 500 <br/>
feet until you enter a grove of oak trees marking the entrance to a <br/>
small canyon.  Shortly after entering the oak grove you'll see a <br/>
rusty-yellow square to your left (horse tie-up, object from <br/>
space??).  Follow the trail to the right of the yellow square until <br/>
you reach a boulder that completely obliterates the trail.  You'd <br/>
have to step over the boulder to continue; instead, step on top of <br/>
it.  Turn around and look south back down the trail from whence you <br/>
came.  You'll see a tree with a hollowed-out trunk facing you to your <br/>
left.  Walk to the other side of this tree and stand with your back <br/>
to the trunk on the opposite side of the hollow.  You'll be looking <br/>
at another tree, due south, about 60 feet in front of you, that is <br/>
ringed with poison oak.  Walk forward from the tree against your back <br/>
towards the poison oak-ringed tree facing you until you are <br/>
equidistant between the two trees.  Tread carefullyyou are on a <br/>
steep hill, walking in tall grass, and there are large stands of <br/>
poison oak to the right and left.  When you have reached the point <br/>
equidistant between the two trees look east up the hill, at a compass <br/>
heading of 110 degrees, to see two other trees.  Climb up to the <br/>
first of these trees and look underneath a yellow rock at the base of <br/>
its trunk to find the letterbox.  Be careful making your way back <br/>
down the steep hill.<br/>
<br/>
#2.  Coyote Canyon Letterbox<br/>
After finding the Meadow Letterbox, walk back down the trail and <br/>
rejoin the main trail at the signpost marking the Eaton Canyon <br/>
Trail.  Now turn west and follow the Eaton Canyon Trail trail until <br/>
you reach the sign marking the entrance to Coyote Canyon.  Turn right <br/>
and follow the streambed northeast up Coyote canyon.  Stay in the <br/>
streambed.  Streambeds change; at the time I planted the letterbox, I <br/>
had to leave the streambed at one point to scramble around an <br/>
obstacle (a tree), but I was quickly able to rejoin the streambed <br/>
beyond.  Continue walking in the streambed until it takes an abrupt <br/>
turn to the left, just past three large rocks; it will now be heading <br/>
in a northwesterly direction (for the first time).  At this point, <br/>
look for the first large tree on the left.  Scramble up the steep <br/>
incline to reach the tree, and you'll find that the tree trunk has a <br/>
large hollow in the back which is not visible from the trail.  The <br/>
letterbox is hidden in the hollow, underneath a rock and some <br/>
leaves.  <br/>
<br/>
#3.  Walnut Canyon Letterbox<br/>
After finding the Coyote Canyon Letterbox, walk back down the canyon <br/>
streambed until you reach the main Eaton Canyon Trail, then continue <br/>
west until you reach the sign marking the entrance to Walnut Canyon <br/>
(the sign was knocked off the pole and is sitting by the trail, there <br/>
is another brown and yellow sign showing a horse marking the canyon <br/>
entrance).  Turn right at the sign and walk 20 steps up the canyon <br/>
along a very well-traveled, well-marked equestrian trail that moves <br/>
steeply up the hill to join the Mount Wilson Toll Road above; <br/>
however, you are not going to continue on this trailat this point <br/>
you are stepping off to the right of the trail into the not well-<br/>
traveled, not well-marked streambed beside the trail, which moves up <br/>
the canyon through a lot of brush.  Stay in the streambed.  Continue <br/>
walking northeast, avoiding the stretches of bank covered in poison <br/>
oak. At one point in the streambed you'll have to walk underneath a <br/>
tree trunk "limbo-style."  Shortly after you dance the limbo, the <br/>
streambed takes an abrupt turn to the left (sound familiar?).  Stop <br/>
at this point and look to the left of the trail where you will see a <br/>
large eucalyptus tree.  Now look to the right of the trail to see a <br/>
walnut tree.  (You can tell this is a walnut tree by observing the <br/>
broken walnut shells on the ground around it.)  Take a closer look at <br/>
the walnut tree and you'll see a large, flat piece of rusted metal <br/>
entwined in its rootsperhaps left over from the family that <br/>
homesteaded this canyon early in the last century.  Scramble up the <br/>
hill to the right of the walnut tree and behind the piece of rusted <br/>
metal you'll find the rock that conceals the letterbox.  <br/>

Congrats on your first letterboxes plant I was at Eaton a week ago and wanted to take my daughter back this weekend but we got rained out. So glad we did, now we can go and search out your boxes!  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>

I hope your daughter doesn't mind walking through a lot of brush in <br/>
Walnut Canyon.  I met a life-long Pasadenan while planting the Coyote <br/>
Canyon LB (actually, she caught me) and she didn't even know that you <br/>
could walk up Walnut Canyon (where my third LB is placed).  At the <br/>
beginning of the trail, it looks like you're just walking through <br/>
bushes, but it opens up into a more or less real trail a ways up, and <br/>
you'll find yourself walking through a streambed surrounded by walnut <br/>
trees and poison oak--love the San Gabrial Mountains' poison oak, <br/>
it's a beautiful plant, and makes the hike so much more interesting--<br/>
like walking in Rappacini's Garden.  If you keep following the Walnut <br/>
Canyon streambed past my letterbox, you'll find it shortly ends at a <br/>
shear wall of rock that has been hollowed out by rainwater over the <br/>
centuries.  Best of luck being the first stamp.<br/>
