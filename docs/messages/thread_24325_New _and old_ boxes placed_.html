<br/>
1.  "You Press the Button, We Do the Rest" (Rochester, NY) has been <br/>
replaced after having gone missing nearly a year ago.  More <br/>
information was posted on the LbNY board at <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbNY/message/2071.  Clues are posted on <br/>
my website at <br/>
http://www.huntingtupperware.com/clues/You_Press_The_Button_We_Do_The_<br/>
Rest.html<br/>
<br/>
2.  "German Automobiles (a series)", a 6-box series, has been planted <br/>
along the Mohawk Trail in Massachusetts.  This is a driving series <br/>
that takes you from Greenfield to Williamstown.  I am putting some <br/>
final edits on the clues and will post them on my website sometime <br/>
today: <br/>
http://www.huntingtupperware.com/clues/German_Automobile_Series.html<br/>
<br/>
I am intending on adding a bonus box to this series, but won't have <br/>
the chance to do this until mid-June.  It's your call if you want to <br/>
do the series now or wait!<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see you all at the Old-Fashioned Gathering in Hopkinton, MA <br/>
this Saturday!<br/>
