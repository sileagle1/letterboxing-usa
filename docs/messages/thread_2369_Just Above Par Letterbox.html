<br/>Difficulty: Easy
<br/>Time: 1 Hour

<br/>
<br/><b>Directions:
<br/>
<br/></b>Take I-480 to the Columbia Road (RT. 252) exit. At the end of the exit, turn 
<br/>north. Take a right onto Brookpark Road (east). Take a left onto Mastick 
<br/>Road. Follow Mastick Road down into the Rocky River Reservation of the 
<br/>Cleveland Metroparks. Cross the Valley Parkway and find Mastick Woods Golf 
<br/>Course on your left hand side. Park in the parking lot just beyond the golf 
<br/>course. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/><b>Clues:
<br/>
<br/></b>In 1919 the Cleveland Metropark System began as a 3.8 acre park in the 
<br/>northern part of this reservation. It has grown over the years to 19,000 
<br/>acres of land in a chain of twelve park reservations, collectively known as 
<br/>the Emerald Necklace, encircling downtown Cleveland. Most of us Clevelanders 
<br/>simply refer to the park as 'The Valley' because most of the land follows 
<br/>river beds well bellow street level. We feel so fortunate to have such 
<br/>unspoiled settings so close at hand. Come visit  a favorite spot of mine! 
<br/>
<br/>Running along the left hand side of the golf course, and alongside the Rocky 
<br/>River, is a bridle trail. Follow this trail beyond and away from the golf 
<br/>course. You'll pass an apparent debris dump for the park maintenance dept. 
<br/>Check out the  half decaying tree with some remarkable shelf fungus on the 
<br/>left side! You'll also pass some amazing huge old sycamores, and leave 
<br/>traffic noises and 'civilization' behind. 
<br/>
<br/>The bridle path will gently start ascending. You'll have a fine view of Rocky 
<br/>River as the trail passes more closely to the river - a rail will stop you 
<br/>from tumbling. The trail takes a little dip, then begins to look like part of 
<br/>it is eroding away. The trail will level out, take a small dip then ascends 
<br/>more steeply, curving to the right. 
<br/>
<br/>Stop when you crest the hill and stop by the tree on the left side of the 
<br/>trail. Turn to 200 degrees (your back will be at the tree). You will see a 
<br/>nicely rounded mound with a decaying tree centered on it. Walk to the right 
<br/>of that tree. When even with that tree, and looking straight ahead, you'll 
<br/>notice a tree laying on the ground, pointing to the left. On your right will 
<br/>be a swampy area and anther fallen tree. Again, walk to the right of the tree 
<br/>straight ahead of you. 27 paces from that tree, and slightly up the rise of 
<br/>the hill is a tree who's base is starting to rot - find the letterbox!
<br/>
<br/>When you return to the bridle path, take a right and continue on - the trail 
<br/>gradually gets narrower and offers some wonderful views of Rocky River. The 
<br/>trail will loop at the end and send you back the way you came. Enjoy your day!
