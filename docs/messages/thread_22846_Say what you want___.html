hunting boxes. Whether they be well written clues, or the more "cryptic" <br/>
ones, the hunt shall prevail for me, not the vote. I can only stand doing <br/>
that every four years anyway. This egroups forum used to be a more useful <br/>
tool before we had the ability to edit our boxes on the LBNA site itself. <br/>
Although I can still see it used as a tool to let people know that there are <br/>
indeed new boxes when they do come out. Sort of an advertisement. Back in <br/>
2000 we had a bit of a contest going as to who would find the newest boxes <br/>
in CT first. Ha ha ha, sometimes they'd be found within hours of the <br/>
posting!<br/>

&gt;I like the group vote part, especially if there were choices of<br/>
&gt;banning or just moderated status.<br/>
&gt;Nisha<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;SNIP&lt;<br/>
&gt;  BUT! I think we should all vote on it. Dreagon<br/>
&gt;  was put to a vote and after a 62-1 vote to ban him, it was done. Also<br/>
&gt;if he comes forward and says he sorry the ban will be lifted. I know<br/>
&gt;no one<br/>
&gt;wants to ban anyone but no one wants to logon to trash talk. Your in<br/>
&gt;the hobby to feel good and find a box in the woods.<br/>
&gt;I also do not think a few people should have the power to ban someone<br/>
&gt;but the group as a whole  should. The group can act as a safe guard.<br/>
&gt;It's easy to make a few people mad but it's really hard to make a<br/>
&gt;whole group mad. (62-1) It's  good bet that the person is/was a jerk<br/>
&gt;and the group is better off without hat problem.&gt;SNIP&lt;<br/>
