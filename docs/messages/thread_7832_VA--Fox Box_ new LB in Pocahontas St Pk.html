Location: Pocahontas State Park, VA<br/>
County: Chesterfield<br/>
Nearest town: Richmond, VA<br/>
Date Placed: Sept. 21, 2002<br/>
Placed by: boxitup (R. Hamilton)<br/>
Total distance: 1 1/2 to 2 miles, easy trail<br/>
COMPASS NEEDED<br/>
<br/>
After you enter the park, go straight on the main road and follow the signs to the CCC Museum. Park in the CCC Museum's parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
1. From right behind the Museum, take the paved trail that is bordered by the wooden fence.<br/>
<br/>
2. At the first sign, take the Spillway Trail (this is also the Beaver Lake Trail).<br/>
<br/>
3. At the site of the actual spillway, take the Beaver Lake Trail (blue sign).<br/>
<br/>
4. Cross the small concrete-and-wood bridge across the water and go on the Old Mill Bicycle Trail.<br/>
<br/>
5. Pass the old homestead on the right--only the chimney still stands!<br/>
<br/>
6. Stay on the Old Mill Bike Trail through the areas where a lot of timber has fallen.<br/>
<br/>
7. You will pass a wooden bench on your right.<br/>
<br/>
8. At the T-intersection, go right.<br/>
<br/>
9. Soon you will come upon a sign that says "warning" on your right. Park your rear end on the "warning" lettering. With a compass, find 140 degrees (directly southeast).<br/>
<br/>
10. Aiming across the path in that direction, take 45 paces through leaf litter and woods (rough going!)<br/>
<br/>
11. At 45 paces, within an arm's length on your right you will see 3 large trees grouped very closely together; two spindly holly trees stand with them.<br/>
<br/>
12. Within arm's length on your left is the tree you are looking for. In the hollow at its base is the Fox Box. Please hide the box with pieces of bark when you are done.<br/>
<br/>
Note: Rather than return the way you came, it is slightly shorter to continue on past the "warning" sign to the next trail sign, and take the Old Mill Site/Beaver Lake Trail back to the CCC Museum.<br/>
