                                 Ithaca is a unique, small city in<br/>
central New York (Tompkins County).  It is located on<br/>
                                 Cayuga Lake, one of the Finger Lakes<br/>
formed thousands of years ago by huge glaciers<br/>
                                 which left behind spectacular gorges.<br/>
Ithaca is home to 29,000 residents and nearly as<br/>
                                 many college students.<br/>
<br/>
                                 The Cornell Plantations is an outdoor<br/>
museum where you can enjoy over three thousand<br/>
                                 acres of natural beauty adjacent to the<br/>
Cornell University campus.  The botanical garden<br/>
                                 features fourteen specialty gardens,<br/>
and the campus collections contain many unusual<br/>
                                 plants for horticultural study.  The<br/>
natural areas include bogs, fens, gorges, meadows and<br/>
                                 woodlands, all protected for research<br/>
and education. The F. R. Newman Arboretum<br/>
                                 includes maples, oaks, flowering trees,<br/>
pines and other species in 150 acres of a park-like<br/>
                                 setting. To ensure the health of the<br/>
plant collections, and to preserve them for generations<br/>
                                 to come, please leash and clean up<br/>
after your pets, and do not collect or remove any<br/>
                                 flowers, fruits or plants. (information<br/>
taken from a brochure)<br/>
<br/>
                                 GETTING TO THE PLANTATIONS:<br/>
<br/>
                                 Coming from the West by one of three<br/>
route numbers (79,96 or 89), go down a hill into<br/>
                                 Ithaca, and turn left onto Route 13<br/>
North. If you are coming from the East on Route 79,<br/>
                                 go down the hill, and in Ithaca, turn<br/>
right onto Route 13 North.<br/>
                                 Continue on Route 13 North past the<br/>
Cayuga Heights Exit and the Pyramid Mall Exit.<br/>
                                 Continue to the stoplight where you<br/>
will make a right turn onto Warren Road.  Continue<br/>
                                 on that road for a mile.  At the<br/>
four-way stop, stay on Warren Road which will take you<br/>
                                 past a golf course and down a steep<br/>
hill to a stop sign where you turn left.  This road<br/>
                                 winds across a one-way bridge; coming<br/>
off the bridge, turn left onto Forest Home Drive.<br/>
                                 Proceed for six tenths of a mile along<br/>
the creek to the first parking area on the left where<br/>
                                 you can leave your car.<br/>
<br/>
                                 Specific Clues:  Cross the road, and<br/>
enter through the gate.  Walking stright in at first, make the<br/>
                                 first right.    Walking stright you<br/>
will come to the 1st path.  The path will be on your right hand side.<br/>
                                 You will see an Umbrella Magnolia tree<br/>
to enter the path.  Go stright on the path and cross a bridge.<br/>
                                 Continue on the path you will see a<br/>
steep  wooden staircase at the end of the path.  Go to the top of<br/>
                                 the stairs.  Cross the road and<br/>
straight across you will see a clearing up the hill with a wooden bench<br/>
                                 against a stone wall.  The Ralph T.<br/>
Reeve Bench.  Between 2 trees or 20 paces in back of the bench<br/>
                                 and on the right you will find your<br/>
path.  Take 37 Paces.  On the right you will see your big rock and<br/>
                                 tree.  In between you will find me.<br/>

                                 I live on Long Island, NY and was<br/>
visiting my sister and had to plant my first box here.  A piece of me<br/>
                                 left behind for letterboxers to enjoy.<br/>
