the webmasters about a couple duplicate boxes etc...  including the <br/>
two Ky boxes I put out.  <br/>
<br/>
Looks like we are roughly back up to about 300 boxes in Ohio <br/>
again...  If Jedi's boxes are not yet up, that should add to the <br/>
total.  Go TEAM OHIO!<br/>

&gt; &gt; All Ohio boxes that were hosted on the old letterboxing site have <br/>
&gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; transferred to the new one. This does not include boxes that are <br/>
&gt; hosted on<br/>
&gt; &gt; sites other than letterboxing.org (such as FlyFisher and Team <br/>
&gt; Jedi). <br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Please let me know about errors, omissions, duplicates, etc., and <br/>
&gt; I will<br/>
&gt; &gt; happily fix them. If you would like boxes transferred into your <br/>
&gt; name, please<br/>
&gt; &gt; holler. And if you'd like help listing your boxes on the new <br/>
site, <br/>
&gt; again,<br/>
&gt; &gt; please just ask.<br/>
