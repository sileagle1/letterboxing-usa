In the new issue (Nov/Dec 98) of Somerset Studio (a magazine for paper<br/>
arts, art stamping and letter arts ) is an excerpt from the Smithsonian<br/>
article about Letterboxing.  This should generate more interest in US<br/>
letterboxing-more boxes to find!<br/>

    Wish I could still get a stamp they stopped the 10000 one some years <br/>
ago<br/>
so this year I will not get one having got over the 5000 now.<br/>
Does anyone know if the article in the Smithsonian has been reprinted in <br/>
any<br/>
other magazines over there. Chris Granstrom told me there were two mags <br/>
that<br/>
were going to reprint the article about me and change the picture to one <br/>
of<br/>
myself and my daughter Tegan (Tiggy Teapot) but I have heard no more. Can<br/>
any one help with more info.<br/>
Yes it is meet weekend. As usual it is raining and the gales are blowing.<br/>
And yes like a fool I will still be going out.<br/>
I have brought in 15 of my stamps and will be taking them with me so that<br/>
anyone who did not find them will have a chance to get a copy.<br/>
It is not all it is made out to be. Very disorganized. Very busy. But I <br/>
will<br/>
queue as usual for the official meet stamp.<br/>
I have decided to let my clues be released to the group. If Dan could get<br/>
intouch with me direct I will get him to help me set it all up. I don,t <br/>
know<br/>
if any of you will come and get them but if you do let me know. Door is<br/>
always open here.<br/>
Must go now as I have my last 500 finds to catalogue. Thats about six <br/>
months<br/>
worth it has been a quite year this year. Actually six months.<br/>

&gt; Adrian<br/>
<br/>
Adrian is referring to the Somerset Studio article mentioned by Sheila<br/>
Cunningham recently.  Do we know that they excerpted anything but<br/>
general letterboxing info?  And do we know that their interest is<br/>
anything but a general interest in letterboxing?  They were likely just<br/>
doing us a favor -- to help the hobby get exposure, generate interest<br/>
and the like.  That's my take on it.<br/>
<br/>
Does that alleviate your concerns at all, Adrian?<br/>
<br/>
I'm quite certain Adrian, that no one in this group is looking for<br/>
anything but a little diverse fun.  In fact, a great many of us are here<br/>
because we protested the very thing to which you're referring.  But I<br/>
hope it's behind us now.  I'm looking forward to a long, uninterrupted<br/>
time of old-fashioned fun without having to be concerned about all the<br/>
hoopla -- and the commercial minutia.  It was the only thing so far that<br/>
wasn't any fun.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I feel that letterboxing is a poor choice as a commercial<br/>
venture.  I mean every box costs a little bit of money to put together.<br/>
If people don't enjoy the hobby they won't be willing to provide any<br/>
resources.  So just who is supposed to profit from their efforts?  No. <br/>
The profit is in the adventure and the spirit of the hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a quote from Dennis Perkins (Florida) in which he compares<br/>
letterboxing to birding: "A look at the desired stamp could generate<br/>
interest.  I don't think looking at the object lessens the quest.  In<br/>
bird watching the quest is the goal, each birder knows the sought after<br/>
species, it's the quest that is the real challenge."<br/>
<br/>
That sums it up for me too.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Hmmmm I'm no expert, but I don't think authors have to ask permission to write<br/>
people's names in their articles, reviews, novels, etc... I haven't yet<br/>
received my issue of Somerset.  I also doubt that there is financial gain for<br/>
Somerset editors by mentioning this hobby.... is the Smithsonian a free<br/>
magazine? Where do I get my free subscription?<br/>
