                    <div class="plaintext-content">David, I think it's best to post new boxes (hitch hikers and all) <br/>
right here to the talk list so everyone can see them. Then your <br/>
helpful webmasters will scoop them up and publish them for the whole <br/>
world to see. I'm the one who is responsible for hitchers and the <br/>
whatsnew page, where this box should show up "soon" after you post. I <br/>
try to do updates twice a week: on Tuesday evenings and once over the <br/>
weekend. Can't wait to see your new box!<br/>
