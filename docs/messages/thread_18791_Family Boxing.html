The above-mentioned leashed son can still manage to jump on people and lick <br/>

Background story: Our trail name is for our family, our kids love to tag along and "help" solve the clues even though I am the only really "active" boxer in the family. My wife likes boxing but hasn't really been too involved until recently. She decided to plant a box (just for me ;-x) as my valentines present.<br/>
<br/>
It was a great outing and a great gift, but now I'm stuck.Should I list the box as planted and found by our team and then retire it? It seems to me that finding your own boxes is a little strange. I don't want to seem like I am padding my numbers, but I would like our online log book to match the hand held one. Also I plan to plant boxes later on for my kids to find- and anyone else who wants to search for them. My kids have talked about choosing their own names but haven't really decided to be counted individually. If we stay boxing as a family I'd be in the same boat: I (we) planted it, we found it.<br/>
<br/>
So, how would you list such a box? Would you list such a box?<br/>
<br/>
My current resolution:<br/>
I have given her her own trail name so she could be listed independently as the carver and planter.<br/>

 If she is the planter and you are the finder its time to split your trail names - each member of your family could have their own trail name and then you could also use the "family" name for when you box together. Technically on this box (IMO) your wife is the planter and you are the finder. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think it would be pointless to list it on LbNA--that site really is for sharing clues with others rather than keeping an accurate logbook. Your current solution will work fine on AQ, just list it as a box w/out clues &amp; that should keep it from appearing in other peoples's searches.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the "accurate logbook online" thing, though... I gave up on that one!<br/>
