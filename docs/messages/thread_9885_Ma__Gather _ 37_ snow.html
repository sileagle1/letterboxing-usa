                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi I can't remember if I replied earlier.  Pink Trotters , Cowboy and <br/>
Leader of the Pack are planning the day with you in Sharon  unless we <br/>
get another  storm!  We can't wait!   Any others in  Mansfield, Ct.  <br/>
area want a lift I have 3 empty seats.<br/>
    For all you  unhappy with the weather on Christmas or happy with <br/>
it consider this. my friend in Herkimer County New York got 37 <br/>
inches  on Christmas day. It took two days to dig out their barn . <br/>
They got off easy their Amish neighbors barn roof caved in killing <br/>
five cows and injuring four others. The miracle was that the  father <br/>
had left the barn only moments before the roof let go  and he was <br/>
spared.   When I go to new york to visit I think I'll have to leave a <br/>
37"  snow letterbox in their town!  It will be spring before we could <br/>
find a place to hide it!     Happy Boxing all    carol- leader of the <br/>
pack<br/>
