tiny t-shirts get more people involved in letterboxing? It aint T-shirt<br/>
boxing.  The State of Illinois, at least the parts that mtcobras in, will<br/>
pass on this.<br/>

&gt; Hey, everyone. I've been involved in Letterboxing for a long time and<br/>
&gt; I just love it and I've been trying to think of ways to get more and<br/>
&gt; more people involved. So I printed 100 Limited Edition T-Shirts with<br/>
&gt; a cool design on them. I've gotten a bunch of people helping me, but<br/>
&gt; I would like to bury at least 1 shirt in every state. (I also have a<br/>
&gt; few being buried in other countries)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My plan is for people to find them, take a photo holding the T-Shirt<br/>
&gt; up, put their signature stamp on the back of the T-Shirt, and then<br/>
&gt; replace the T-Shirt for others to find. Everyone can then e-mail me<br/>
&gt; the photos that they took of the shirt and at the end of the year<br/>
&gt; I'll give away some cool prizes or something.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thoughts? Want to help?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll e-mail you a T-Shirt. Your job would be to come up with some<br/>
&gt; awesome clues and maybe some ciphers and riddles, etc. to make it a<br/>
&gt; bit more interesting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To keep anyone from walking away with a T-Shirt, I had the shirts<br/>
&gt; printed extra small. Believe me, no one will be able to fit into one<br/>
&gt; of these little fellahs. Besides, why would anyone want to take one<br/>
&gt; anyway, and ruin the adventure for others? Also if they just find it<br/>
&gt; and replace it, there's a chance of winning a prize.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, yeah, and for helping me do this I can offer you a free T-shirt,<br/>
&gt; too, or something. As if the fun of doing it wans't enough!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So ... what do you think?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feel free to e-mail me directly and let me know what state you are in<br/>
&gt; and what ideas you have for clues, etc. and we'll try to work<br/>
&gt; something out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I'm koo-koo, but my heart's in the right place, so that counts<br/>
&gt; for something; right?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Amber<br/>
