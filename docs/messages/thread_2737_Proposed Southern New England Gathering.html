I would like to offer to host a letterboxing gathering in Rhode <br/>
Island in Sep or Oct.  I think that an ideal site would be Burlingame <br/>
State Park.  It is very close to the beach and several LB's.  There <br/>
are many trails in the area that don't have boxes that could be added <br/>

<br/>
I am very much in favor of another gathering. I have been boxin' for more<br/>
than two years, and all but one of the gatherings have occurred while I was<br/>
out of town on business.<br/>

for a letterbox series. Maybe a Gathering will give us the impetus to <br/>
get carving. To steal an idea from Sarah F, we've been thinking about <br/>
putting in an 18-hole golf series at the VGT. Probably too ambitious, <br/>
but what the hey.<br/>

Fall on the RI shore? We're there!<br/>
