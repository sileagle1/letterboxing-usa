Avery Memorial<br/>
<br/>
Today's walk will take you through some of Norwich's historical district. <br/>
Total time to do this is about an hour with about a short mile hike of easy <br/>
neighborhood walking and a small hill at the end.<br/>
<br/>
To get to the starting point you will want to take 395 north to exit 82. You <br/>
will then turn right and pass through a double stoplight. You will continue <br/>
on for about a half mile until you come to a stop sign at an intersection in <br/>
front of an old white church on the left. You'll then take a right to the <br/>
next stoplight and if you look ahead to the left of the intersection you will <br/>
see a small dead end road. You want to go down there. It is called Old <br/>
Cemetery Lane.<br/>
<br/>
You will park at the gate of the Old Town Cemetery. There you will find an <br/>
info center with pamphlets. Take one of each for they all tell you a bit <br/>
about what you will be passing. Yes, this course takes your through a <br/>
cemetery but it is a rather respectable one. You may recognize some names if <br/>
you look closely. Continue into the cemetery for about 50-60 feet and feel <br/>
free to explore. The map section of the pamphlet was the project of an Eagle <br/>
Scout of Boy Scout Troop 4 of Norwich. Now proceed toward Huntington's Tomb. <br/>
Yes, this is the resting-place of Samuel Huntington, signer of the <br/>
Declaration of Independence. You may also note that some relatives of <br/>
Benedict Arnold rest here as well as this was his American hometown.<br/>
<br/>
Continue past Huntington's tomb up and over the hill and you will see a <br/>
carriage pathway running alongside someone's home, leading to a street. Exit <br/>
through the gate (or the small space next to it if the gate is closed). Turn <br/>
left down the slate sidewalk and around the corner. You will now be facing <br/>
the Norwichtown Green and the village that surrounds it. Feel free to tour <br/>
the area with one of the pamphlets from the info center at the cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
After checking out all the old colonial homes, proceed up to the First <br/>
Congregational Church of Norwich. This is where "the ram" goes to church. <br/>
Nice people, nice pastor, great message. Feel free to stop in and see Pastor <br/>
Frost if he is in his office as you will want to be between the Church and <br/>
its white companion building, Speerli Hall. Looking up the driveway you will <br/>
see a hill with a chain gate at the beginning. You will want to go past this <br/>
chain (it's okay, you'll see if you read the sign) and proceed up the <br/>
carriage path around the bend to the top of the hill.<br/>
<br/>
You have reached the top of Meetinghouse Rocks. This is the former site of <br/>
one of the meetinghouses in the colonial era (more on that in one of those <br/>
pamphlets too!). It is now a memorial to a former church member who gave so <br/>
much to the young people in the congregation. Avery Chapel is now used by the <br/>
Church as a gathering spot for special church events to include the Church's <br/>
sunrise service every Easter morning at about 6am. This is a beautiful spot <br/>
to see the sun rise. You can also see a good deal of this side of Norwich but <br/>
don't get too close to the edge because it's straight down to West Town <br/>
Street from there. Okay, on with the hunt.<br/>

    We went out to your very first letterbox tonight.  Great Job!!  We<br/>
really enjoyed walking around historic Norwich and learning a little about<br/>
the area.  The view from the top was really cool, you really can see half of<br/>
Norwich from there.  Can't wait for your next box.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Well, here is "the ram's" first letterbox placement! Look for more soon as<br/>
I<br/>
&gt;have thought up an interesting series! The clue is as follows and puts<br/>
&gt;Norwich on the map a little more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Avery Memorial<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Today's walk will take you through some of Norwich's historical district.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;You have reached the top of Meetinghouse Rocks. This is the former site of<br/>

&gt;pamphlets too!). It is now a memorial to a former church member who gave so<br/>

but<br/>
&gt;don't get too close to the edge because it's straight down to West Town<br/>
&gt;Street from there. Okay, on with the hunt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;From the metal pulpit pole on the gray concrete slab, proceed to the<br/>
second<br/>
&gt;pine tree at 220 degrees. Just beyond that you will find a small grassy<br/>
&gt;clearing. No need to go any further than the clearing because to your<br/>
&gt;immediate right is a small slab of shelf-rock that is host to a small pile<br/>
of<br/>
&gt;stones under it. There you will find the Avery Memorial Letterbox.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After stamping up, you may exit the way you came, or you may take a small<br/>
&gt;path from the "church-side" of the chapel leading down to a set of stone<br/>
&gt;stairs. Yet another Troop 4 Eagle Scout restoration project! If you opt for<br/>
&gt;the stairs you will want to make your way back to your vehicle via crossing<br/>
&gt;over to the green and then across Elm Ave to Old Cemetery Road to the Old<br/>
&gt;Town Cemetery.<br/>

so quickly! Bob Disch will have to settle for second as he mentioned he was <br/>
rather interested in bagging that box first. More to come VERY SOON as i <br/>
found a REALLY KILLER deal on ink pads. And I shall share... if you can get <br/>
there folks, head down to a store near Bob's in Waterford called Odd Job. A <br/>
few weeks ago I found some auto stamper refill pads (about 1.5"x2" length and <br/>
width). These stamp pads had their own little covers and came in packs of <br/>
three. Each pack costing only 49 CENTS!!!!!  I'll bet dollars to donuts there <br/>
are still more. I've got my fill for now... I snagged ten bucks worth. Good <br/>
luck all!<br/>
