I am there to protect her. Molly sounds a lot like Ozzy. She is a big coward and loves everybody and everything. Some sort of weapon may be in order on some trips. Thats more of a personal choice of what you are comfortable with. My point is that yes you do take a chance when taking a dog out into the woods. I pay more attention to protecting Molly than myself. This is the first year I am considering wearing orange myself. Some of these guys out there don't deserve the right to hunt when you hear about their behavior. If you want any more info on hiking with a dog, I'd be glad to help if I can.....Chuck and Molly

I'm a hunter.  I found my first letterbox last week while I was <br/>
hunting.  Most hunters are responsable.  We have a good ethic.  But a <br/>
few rotten apples always spoil the barrel.  You should always wear <br/>
orange during hunting season.  It's a good idea to put orange on your <br/>
dog to.  Cool club you have here, who made it?  I'd like to find some <br/>
more boxes, but I like to hunt more, and you can only do that now <br/>
(legally).  But now I have something to hunt during the off season.<br/>
