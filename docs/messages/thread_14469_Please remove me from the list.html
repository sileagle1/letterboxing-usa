&gt;  <br/>
&gt; This SHOULD be fixed.  We'll see how it works, though.<br/>
&gt; If you really want your box announced, you can delete it and re-add it.<br/>
&gt; Or, just count on people going to "What's New?" to see about it.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are experiencing the same problem.  Plus, if you go to the announce site <br/>
&gt; itself, it only lists one box post July 2nd.  It seems as if it goes beyond <br/>
&gt; the announcements not making it to the individuals, but the master archives <br/>
&gt; themselves as well.  BeMa<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: Need advice regarding trail dogs<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dear Warrior Woman,<br/>
&gt; Well - I can give you my advice. (I do national animal welfare for a <br/>
&gt; living, if that makes a difference)  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At National Parks, dogs are REQUIRED to be on a 6' leash or shorter. <br/>
&gt; National Forests also have rules regarding pets - though these can be <br/>
&gt; interpreted a bit more loosely - check with the ranger.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your State Parks and Open Spaces may have different rules, you can <br/>
&gt; check with your Park Ranger and you should report folks on the trails <br/>
&gt; that are in violation.  I can't remember what state you were in, so <br/>
&gt; taking a wild stab, I checked CT.  CT State Parks and Forests require <br/>
&gt; dogs to be on a leash, too.  (if you're not in CT, email me and I'll <br/>
&gt; check the regs for you for other states)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for carrying mace, etc.  Your suggestion of carrying a big stick <br/>
&gt; was right on the money.  No ... I'm not suggesting that you "whack <br/>
&gt; the living crap out of them" - but you CAN use the stick to keep the <br/>
&gt; dog at bay - and to put some distance between you and the dog.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This can often buy you enough time to alert the dog's owner who <br/>
&gt; should be in control of the animal to begin with.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don't get me wrong, I love to see dogs on trails, but only off-leash <br/>
&gt; if its allowed, and if the dog is NOT aggressive.  Many, many folks <br/>
&gt; think their dog is not a problem until it is too late and their <br/>
&gt; animal has bitten someone.  I get LOTS of calls every day like that.  <br/>
&gt; Always better to be safe, for both the dog and the other hikers out <br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best,<br/>
&gt; Autumn<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Warrior Woman wrote:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are a lot of dogs with people on the trails.  Most of the time, <br/>
&gt; the dog owners are quite responsible with their dogs, but I have <br/>
&gt; discovered that other owners have not yet acquired that skill.  I <br/>
&gt; have been jumped upon, barked at furiously, and actually nipped.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My day went downhill from there!  I went out to find Willimantic<br/>
&gt; River Trail, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and on my way to the box, what do I find???  A burnt animal<br/>
&gt; (probably a deer) <br/>
&gt; &gt; carcass right smack dab in the middle of the trail!  UGH did it<br/>
&gt; stink!  Then <br/>
&gt; &gt; to make matters more interesting, when I got to the box, the box had<br/>
&gt; been <br/>
&gt; &gt; totally trashed (looks like by an animal) and the logbook had been<br/>
&gt; chewed apart!  <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have pulled the box for Chuck so don't go out looking for it!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Then, I went to Camp Exploration in Windham to find the first two boxes <br/>
&gt; &gt; totally ruined by rain and animals.  I have also pulled those boxes<br/>
&gt; and have <br/>
&gt; &gt; refreshed them, however, I have not replaced them yet, so don't go<br/>
&gt; looking!  BTW... <br/>
&gt; &gt; I couldn't find the third box, and wonder if through all of the<br/>
&gt; clear cutting <br/>
&gt; &gt; that happened, that the box was located and thrown away.  Since the<br/>
&gt; boxes are <br/>
&gt; &gt; (I think) orphaned, I don't know who to contact concerning that.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; After that, I went and found, successfully, the North Windham Station <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox, and it was in good order (thank goodness!).  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Since I had Chuck, Chickabirdie and Molly's box in the car, I<br/>
&gt; thought I would <br/>
&gt; &gt; drop it off at their house.  I called but left a message, but by the<br/>
&gt; time I <br/>
&gt; &gt; got there, Chickabirdie was home and I got to have a pleasant<br/>
&gt; conversation with <br/>
&gt; &gt; her, Molly, Max, and Lily.  Daisy decided that I was a stranger and was <br/>
&gt; &gt; hiding somewhere.  (BTW... Max, Lily and Daisy are the three cats).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; After a nice chat, I went on and found Eternal Love and all of the<br/>
&gt; John Wayne <br/>
&gt; &gt; Series in Coventry, on my way home.  By the time I found the last<br/>
&gt; John Wayne <br/>
&gt; &gt; box, the rain was coming down in buckets.  Of course, when I got<br/>
&gt; back to my <br/>
&gt; &gt; car, I didn't see my car!  It was because somehow (even in gear and<br/>
&gt; on what I <br/>
&gt; &gt; thought was a level parking spot... I have a manual transmission<br/>
&gt; car) my car <br/>
&gt; &gt; decided to cross the street and fall into a small gully on the<br/>
&gt; opposite side of <br/>
&gt; &gt; the street!  Thank goodness it didn't hit another car, or person, or<br/>
&gt; a tree.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; It just has a scratch on its front (brand new) bumper.  Thankfully,<br/>
&gt; only one <br/>
&gt; &gt; wheel was in the gully, and I was able to get the car out safely.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I decided at that point that I had had enough excitement for one day<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; called it quits.  Lets hope tomorrow's boxing experience is much<br/>
&gt; less eventful.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hopefully I'll find some boxes without the hoopla!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; Where Were You When I Needed You.  On trails day weekend( June 7-8,2003 ), <br/>
&gt; the Long Island Greenbelt Trail Conference sponsored a Hiking Expo.  I finally, <br/>
&gt; talked them into a booth on letterboxing,  So, of course , I was responsible <br/>
&gt; for  the presentation.  Only knowing about letterboxing from the web site, it <br/>
&gt; was a bite of a challenge.  Anyway, I learned a lot by doing.  I have planted <br/>
&gt; two letterboxs and found a few when I went to my son's house in Ct. on Easter <br/>
&gt; Weekend.  I even found  a letterbox on LI  from the clues. Now,  I just have to <br/>
&gt; post the one I planted celebrating the LI Greenbelt's 25th Anniversary and <br/>
&gt; the one in NH , Rosemary's Shower.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will check out  the folder if my computer skills, which are limited will <br/>
&gt; let me. <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the info. <br/>

&gt; Okay, this is probably going to sound hugely stupid.  Please forgive <br/>
&gt; me, I've never done this before.<br/>
&gt; I notice when you sign up to be a member here they give you an email <br/>
&gt; address.  If someone sends something to that address is it posted on <br/>
&gt; this board or does it go somewhere else?  Is there a difference <br/>
&gt; between posting and emailing to the yahoo address?<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance!<br/>
&gt; By the way, I am totally hooked on letterboxing now!  My husband and <br/>
&gt; I went out last month and found 2 of the South Mountain Trinity boxes <br/>
&gt; at Gathland (couldn't find #1, although I am pretty sure we found <br/>
&gt; where it was supposed to be), and the Washington Monument State Park <br/>
&gt; box.  We also couldn't find the High Knob box at Gambrill's State <br/>
&gt; Park.  We're positive we found the right place, so it may be gone.  <br/>
&gt; Vacationing in Georgia last week we found 6 boxes at Stone Mountain!  <br/>
&gt; What a thrill!  My husband was totally impressed that I hiked for so <br/>
&gt; long, and I told him I never would have been interested if not for <br/>
&gt; the fun of finding those boxes.  Now I've become obsessed with <br/>
&gt; scouring the internet in search of more clues!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then I crossed over the highway and placed the Sylvan Scholar box at <br/>
&gt; the Eleanor Cabot Bradley Estate in Canton. This estate has lovely <br/>
&gt; gardens as well as trail through the woods. If you are going to the <br/>
&gt; Blue Hills, this would be an easy stop to add. This is my first stamp <br/>
&gt; that is both completely hand drawn and hand carved. (Not as cavy <br/>

&gt; Welcome, Basses! We've also recently checked on these boxes and found <br/>
&gt; South Mountain Trinity #1 and Washington Monument to be MIA.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for the High Knob box at Gambrill State Park, it's also MIA, but <br/>
&gt; we have some inside info. A good friend is a ranger there. I ran the <br/>
&gt; letterboxing thing by him, thinking I would plant some more boxes <br/>
&gt; there. Because of the proximity of the Catoctin parks to Ft. Detrick, <br/>
&gt; the parks have been combed by the FBI in search of anthrax evidence. <br/>
&gt; He was unaware of the ADG box, but suspects any "suspicious" material <br/>
&gt; has been removed by the FBI. On the bright side, he will let me (us?) <br/>
&gt; place boxes with his approval. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Greetings all in letterboxingdom. My topic today concerns abandoned <br/>
&gt; letterboxes, those little lost children wandering in the woods <br/>
&gt; without a breadcrumb trail back home to their Mommies. Some of them <br/>
&gt; are really lost, to fire (RI), flood (PA), or the Big Bad Wolf (ME). <br/>
&gt; Some aren't lost at all (OR), just not-found. Some have been <br/>
&gt; abandoned by their Daddy (CA) and may or may not be there and may or <br/>
&gt; may not be worth looking for.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lots (over 1000) of these orphans ended up on the new website <br/>
&gt; with "webmasters" as their owner. Your loyal webmasters are going to <br/>
&gt; change ownership of those boxes over to a new list member, <br/>
&gt; OrphanedBox, for a few weeks. Then these boxes will <br/>
&gt; be unlisted, taken off the LbNA pages, gone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now's the time to print out the clues to any of these abandoned <br/>
&gt; children you might want before......poof.<br/>

&gt; Bring swimsuits, one of New England's hidden wonders is just 0.5 miles up the road.  Swim to, under and inside Bartlett's Falls.  Or perhaps a tube on Circle current, or a jump off Eagle's nest is to your liking.  No fees, just park your car off the pavement.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bristol bakery offer bagels, bread and tortes with decent coffee.  Bristol Cliffs diner is worth a visit.  The Bobcat Cafe offers bistro food and designer beer brewed by their sister cafe in Brattleboro.  A  health food store, beeswax candle shop, gallery of local craft artisans, and a head shop offering Nepali clothes.<br/>

&gt; Can we request an ownership transfer? The Fox Run Park is only a few miles from my house. I'd love to keep it in the list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I apologize if this isn't kosher, as I'm a bit new to the fun.<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone, I was told about Letterboxing by a friend on a camping <br/>
&gt; site and decided to check it out. It sounds terribly addictive. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've been reading as much as I can find about Letterboxing, and from <br/>
&gt; what I see, I live in a virgin county. We hold no letterboxes. I've <br/>
&gt; already thought of about 10 places I put boxes, I just need to get my <br/>
&gt; supplies together  and try my hand at carving some stamps. Tomorrow I <br/>
&gt; hope to run to Micheals craft store in Fredericksburg, VA.  to get <br/>
&gt; the stuff for the stamps. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do have a question though, there are a couple of boxes hidden in <br/>
&gt; Fredericksburg, would it be terribly awful if I bought a couple <br/>
&gt; of "store bought" stamps for the kids (ages 12, 9, and 4) and tried <br/>
&gt; to locate a box or two while we were there. We will carve our own (or <br/>
&gt; I should say I'll do the carving) personal stamps, but I don't want <br/>
&gt; to wait another week or so to get started. I have a feeling it's <br/>
&gt; going to take us at long to make our stamps, since we have never done <br/>
&gt; this before. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another question:  I notice on some of the sites, it mentioned using <br/>
&gt; pink pearl erasers, are these like those big pink erasers the kids <br/>
&gt; use in school? Do they hold up well? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance for the information!<br/>
&gt; Dee<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
