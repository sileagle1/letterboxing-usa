                    <html><body><p>Hey there team NW....Well I took some newbies out on Sunday in search of the Murder at Gabriel Park boxes....they really wanted to find those, I wanted to do an easier one because I think this was a tough one to start with. And sure enough we sucked as we found no boxes. Just beer cans and bottles....so has anyone found any of them? The newbies think I am crazy and that letterboxes don't exist....lol....we did find the tree of three and the bridge and the bench but no boxes and no home plate/second plate boxes in the the trees either instead some nice bites and stings on the legs:)....so Ryan my man....you stumped us big time. Two hours worth of walking around the park....

I found all 6 of them, but that was back in November right after Ryan <br/>
had hidden them.  The easiest to find was "Art" the homeless guy.  <br/>
And from the "interview" with Art, you can find 3 more pretty easily, <br/>
but if "Art" is missing, this makes things a little more <br/>
difficult!! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I also  had trouble with the line from homeplate to second <br/>
base...mainly because I was following a line from home plate to first <br/>
base (organized sports was never my forte)--but once I got that <br/>
straightened out, I had no problem finding a witness who had seen <br/>
there the body was found ("Mitch")<br/>
<br/>
It took me about an hour and a half with much backtracking and <br/>
wandering around. <br/>
<br/>
This really is a difficult series to try with newbies!  You would <br/>
have been better off at Tualatin Hills or even Tryon Creek is pretty <br/>
straight forward (once you solve the clues--they are pretty simple <br/>
secret messages....my niece, who is in 3rd grade, was able to solve <br/>
them!)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This probably isn't the best series in the world for newbies since <br/>
it's a little different and not the easiest of boxes to locate.  In <br/>
addition, the clues provided will lead you only to some of the <br/>
boxes.  Those boxes will contain clues for where other boxes are <br/>
located.  So if one of the 'source' boxes is missing, you'll NEVER be <br/>
able to find the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Rest assure that you aren't the only person not to have found any <br/>
boxes.  They COULD be missing, but I'm really not sure and at the <br/>
moment I'm traveling around Central America so checking up on the <br/>
boxes isn't really practical.  If somebody who's found them before <br/>
can check up on the series, that would be great.  If not, it'll have <br/>
to wait until my return.<br/>
<br/>
I would expect at least some of the boxes to have been discovered <br/>
accidentally by this point and are missing.  It's just a matter of <br/>
which ones....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, we too were under the impression that starving artist Art and <br/>
his associated boxes had been spirited away by a bunch of beer-<br/>
guzzling partiers when we visited Gabriel Park at the end of May.<br/>
We did, however, find the murder weapon, another witness, and a few <br/>
footprints in the sand on the other side of the park. We were really <br/>
pressed for time when we were out there (found 66 boxes in 6 days!) <br/>
so I can't say as we spent much time looking for boxes that weren't <br/>
readily apparent, but we were a bit disappointed that about a dozen <br/>
boxes that we looked for had already seemed to have "gone missing".<br/>
Still, boxes or no boxes, getting out and seeing new places is always <br/>
great fun, and the letterboxing just adds to our enjoyment! So thanks <br/>
again to everyone who has placed all these wonderful boxes everywhere!<br/>

2 tries, as we started too late on the first go <br/>

As a curtosey to Ryan, I'll head over to the park <br/>
and check on the box status for each, and report <br/>
back in a day.<br/>
<br/>
If they are still there and you would like someone <br/>
to tag quietly behind you when you do a research, <br/>
I'll be happy to help.  I won't give you the answer <br/>
to the clues or show you where to look, but<br/>
I might not leave an area either if you haven't <br/>
searched thorough enough.<br/>
