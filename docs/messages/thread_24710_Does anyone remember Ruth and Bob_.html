                    <div class="plaintext-content">There were some active boxers back in 2002 that went by the trailname <br/>
Ruth and Bob.  I have found clues to three of their boxes in SW PA, <br/>
and I would like to resurrect them if they are gone, and repair them <br/>
if they are still there, seeing how they are the first boxes in this <br/>
area.  I would obviously want to have their permission before any sort <br/>
of adoption happens though.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to get in touch with them concerning the boxes, but the <br/>
email attached to their old posts here seems to be invalid.  Does <br/>
anyone have current contact info for them?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Mr. Yuk<br/>
