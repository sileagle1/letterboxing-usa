Hi All,<br/>
I have a licensee plate frame on the back, only, that says <br/>
LETTERBOXER on the top and THE ENGRAVER, my trail name, on the <br/>
bottom, the problem is that you won't know I am a "Letterboxer" <br/>
unless you are behind me. What about this idea - tying a certain <br/>
colored ribbon on the antenna? Like the following and what they <br/>
represent: <br/>
PINK-Cancer <br/>
RED-MADD<br/>
YELLOW-Freedom<br/>
WHITE-Wedding<br/>
What does everyone think?<br/>

	Green is a great color!  How many ribbons  and what size?  do you think<br/>
should be placed at the top of the antenn<br/>
	Also a FRS radio channel would be so much better than channel 22 on the<br/>
old CB band.  (Why didn't I think of that?)  I have an FRS unit . They<br/>
default to channel 1 each time the batteries are changed, but that's not<br/>
much of a problem.   Rufis P8 F7<br/>

I don't mean to be showing my lack of education when it comes to neat<br/>
gadgets, but this thread sounds like something I would really be interested<br/>
in getting involved in also.  Could someone take the time to inform those of<br/>
us that are behind the times what kind of equipment we would need exactly, a<br/>
little bit of an idea of how it would work, and what kind of costs we are<br/>
looking at if we wanted to participate.<br/>

Hi Mark,<br/>
The logo doesn't need to be on the ribbon. Just tie a "Green" ribbon <br/>
on and lets see who gets the first exchange.<br/>

Forgive me, there's been so much mail from this list and others, I've lost track of this thread.<br/>
<br/>
#1 --- A green ribbon tied to your antenna says "I'm a boxer".  There is going to be a stamp to exchange?<br/>
<br/>
#2 ---I asked this before but think the question got overlooked.  What do you say on the airwaves to see if there are other boxers in the area?<br/>
