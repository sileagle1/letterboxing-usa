Thanks for telling everyone that there are other options, John.  I use<br/>
the "Web only" option, which means I don't get the messages in my<br/>
email; instead, I visit the Yahoo! Groups site and read the messages<br/>
there, when I have the time and inclination. This way, I'm not<br/>
inundated with messages. When I have free time, I catch up and can<br/>
choose, by scanning message subjects, which ones to read.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to repeat a request someone else made a while back:  Put the<br/>
state of the box(es) you're writing about in the subject line.  It<br/>
makes it much easier for a person to decide if they want to read that<br/>
particular message.<br/>
