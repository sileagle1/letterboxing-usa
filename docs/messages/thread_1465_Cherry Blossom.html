I found the Cherry  Blossom letterbox and indeed I do think it is now in a <br/>
very safe spot. That imported rock did the trick. It just fit in nicely with <br/>
everything else. It had been awhile since I had been out to that area and it <br/>
was a good motivation to return. I had forgotten how awesome that statue is. <br/>
My usual policy is to find one hide one but I did not think ahead enough to <br/>
bring my own rock so your letterbox is still alone in that area. I think I <br/>
will have to add large flat rock to my letterboxing travel kit. Thanks once <br/>
again for adding  letterboxes to the mid-Atlantic region.<br/>
