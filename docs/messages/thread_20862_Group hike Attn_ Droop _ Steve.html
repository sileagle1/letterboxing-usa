Steve thanks so much for putting all this together.<br/>
as my girls would say your the bomb!<br/>
<br/>
I want you to know that I only live a few minutes from<br/>
ZED. Friday night I'll have to go to the homecoming<br/>
game in Zachary my daughter has to turn over her<br/>
crown. :) he he.<br/>
The game begins around 6:30 or 7:00. Would love for<br/>
any of you to come join us for that small town<br/>
homecoming....<br/>
I know Zed has the radio show Saturday morning.. if<br/>
you'd like to come to my house for breakfast your<br/>
invited. We can then proceed to MAB ...<br/>
Steve... I think we should try to gather up and take<br/>
as few cars as possilbe. I know you have a sub bourban<br/>
and so do I. If we have a count and no one is on a<br/>
time limit.. <br/>
any one that wants to meet earlier at Port Hudson that<br/>
easy also . it's just down the street from me.<br/>
<br/>
 Hummerlady and I are leaving in the morning to go to<br/>
Jackson, MS. we plan to letterbox in Natchez on our<br/>
way up and continue on the way back. I need to let go<br/>
of a few HH.<br/>
I'll try to check e-mail for any updates.<br/>
I think you have my personal e-mail. bayougrits@<br/>

Can't wait for the hike..<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>

&gt; before St.<br/>

&gt; Directions: 3 miles north of St. Fancisville on US<br/>
