English holiday, Oregon-style. Windairen, Funhog and Dragondart met at<br/>
the Ace of Fun Box and after stamping in headed for points south.<br/>
Fortunately for us, NPR filled us in on the background of this day<br/>
just as we set out.<br/>
<br/>
In a light drizzle, we stamped into the Oregon Trail Interpretive<br/>
Center box. What a wonderful carving! The petite and well done<br/>
lettering were especially impressive.  Next, it was off to Mary S.<br/>
Young SP in West Linn in a light rain. We succeeded in locating three<br/>
of the seven boxes hidden in the park and learned that the large<br/>
cedars in this park serve well as arboreal umbrellas. The stamps here<br/>
were a cheerful reminder of a sunnier clime. The last leg of our<br/>
journey took us through pouring rain to locate the lovely West Linn<br/>
Mystery Box. Sad to say, this beautiful stamp has taken flight. It is<br/>
no longer nestled in its nest. Having found this box months ago I am<br/>
positive it is missing.<br/>
<br/>
Soaking wet, we headed home dreaming of a functioning windshield<br/>
defroster, dry socks and hot chocolate. Three Oregonians and not one<br/>
of us had worn raingear. Go figure!<br/>

Only three of the seven?  What happened?!<br/>
