<br/>
(Holyoke, Massachusetts)<br/>
<br/>
Location: Mt. Tom State Reservation, MA<br/>
<br/>
Date placed: 3/02/02 by The L Troop<br/>
<br/>
Time: About 45 minutes (from parking area to letterbox)<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Moderately Strenuous<br/>
<br/>
Directions to starting location: <br/>
Mt. Tom State Reservation charges a small fee on weekends<br/>
and holidays during the summer season. <br/>
The entrance to the Reservation is on MA 141 <br/>
at the Holyoke/Easthampton boundary, across from the Log<br/>
Cabin and Harvest Valley restaurants (Note: at the time of this <br/>
writing, the entrance on US 5 in Holyoke is closed).  Note on the<br/>
sign after the kiosk when the gate closes. Proceed <br/>
uphill for about 1 mile until you reach the park headquarters/<br/>
ranger station on the left.  If the road to Bray Lake on the <br/>
right is open, there is a small lot a short distance down it. <br/>
Otherwise, park on the side of one of the roads near<br/>
the headquarters. <br/>
<br/>
Clue:<br/>
<br/>
(Note:Trail maps are usually available at park HQ)<br/>
Follow the paved road heading east from the headquarters building. <br/>
You are looking to pick up the Metacomet-Monadnock (M&amp;M) Trail<br/>
northbound,which is marked with white blazes. Soon, the M&amp;M will join<br/>
the road from the right and coincide with it for a short distance.<br/>
After about 1/5 mile, the M&amp;M trail heads off the road to the left<br/>
(north), generally uphill.<br/>
After 15 minutes you will encounter a lovely vista to the west,<br/>
complete with benches, overlooking Easthampton.<br/>
There is a side trail here on the right, leading to the tower on Goats<br/>
Peak (visible to the right). <br/>
Continue on the M&amp;M, passing through some mountain laurel stands and<br/>
crossing a service road. The blue-blazed Beau Bridges trail will enter<br/>
on the right,and also, shortly afterwards, the red-blazed Teabag<br/>
Trail. At this junction,<br/>
bear right onto the red-blazed trail.  Pass through some more mountain<br/>
laurel,and then descend into a hemlock forest. Be on the lookout for a<br/>
small tree that has a left-pointing arrow and 4 red blazes on it.<br/>
Stop. This should be about 30-40 minutes into the hike, if you didn?t<br/>
stop at Goats Peak. Look to the right<br/>
and notice a rocky cliff sloping down to the left, about 40 yards<br/>
away. Walk down the hill towards this cliff, staying to the left of<br/>
some fallen trees. Now climb<br/>
up the hill, staying to the left of the cliff (it?s about 8? tall),<br/>
and stopping when you notice a log thickly covered with moss. Between<br/>
this log and a tree on the cliff (about 10-12 feet), there is a small<br/>
pile of basalt rocks in which the Teabag Trail Letterbox is hidden.<br/>
<br/>
You can return via the same route, or take a left onto the Beau<br/>
Bridges Trail at the junction mentioned above, which leads you<br/>
downhill to several bridges over Cascade Brook. When you reach<br/>
pavement, take a left, and shortly, a right<br/>
onto the main reservation road. You are now a few hundred yards east<br/>
of where the hike started.<br/>
