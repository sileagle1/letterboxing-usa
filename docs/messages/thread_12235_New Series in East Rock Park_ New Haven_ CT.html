Russ' new series: Above It All.  Being a pilot's daughter and have spent <br/>
hundreds if not thousands of hours in a four seater Piper Arrow (and wanting <br/>
to always learn how to fly, but never enough cash... perhaps AFTER getting my <br/>
master's...sigh), these stamps brought back a lot of memories!  Memories not <br/>
only of my family's trips to Block Island or Florida, but of a friend of mine <br/>
who worked at Tweed New Haven for years before going to work for FedEx in <br/>
Memphis.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway... kudos to Sadie and Russ!  I hope everyone goes out and looks for <br/>
this series!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
