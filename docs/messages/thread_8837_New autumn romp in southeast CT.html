Jordan Mill Letterbox<br/>
Placed by the DrewClan 11/02/02<br/>
Waterford, New London County, CT<br/>
<br/>
Single box on an easy quarter-mile loop.<br/>
<br/>
At Jordon Green in Waterford Connecticut, at the junction of CT Rte. <br/>
156 and 215 (Rope Ferry Rd and Great Neck Rd), drive north on Rte. <br/>
215 a short way. Soon turn right on Trumbull Rd (Governor's Landing). <br/>
Just before the mailbox for #17, turn right down the long driveway to <br/>
the parking area.<br/>
<br/>
Hike downhill to the dam, waterfall, and bridge. Walk downstream on <br/>
the path to the end, and then bear left uphill on wide stairs. Pass <br/>
behind a house and when you're about even with the deck, turn left on <br/>
a faint but wide path.<br/>
<br/>
A short way along you'll come to a line of boulders on the right, <br/>
with one perched pointing to the sky. Take 12 steps in to find the <br/>
Jordon Mill Letterbox under the southeast corner of a large, flat, <br/>
waist-high rock. Since this is a bit of a local hangout, please be <br/>
sure to rehide extra well.<br/>
<br/>
A few steps further along the path will bring you home.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Sure! But coming letterboxing in southeast CT could accidently turn <br/>
into far more than a "short daylight trip!"<br/>

Thanks so much, Judi! We owe it all to TrishK, who turned us on to <br/>
MasterCarve. Once we broke out of that 2"x1" magic rub eraser mindset <br/>
the creative juices took off.<br/>

<div><tt>It sure makes a difference having the additional "real-estate" to work 
with. I just got my first batch of 4x4" mastercarve and am now waiting for

<div><tt>What impressed me too was that your picture seemed to defined more by 
carving out areas of light and dark (very Gestalt) rather than carving an
