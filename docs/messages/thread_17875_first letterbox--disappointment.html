                    <div class="plaintext-content">Only recently had I discovered through the internet the hobby of <br/>
letterboxing.  Especially intrigued by letterboxing.org, I could not <br/>
wait to start locating boxes, designing stamps, and placing my own.  <br/>
After designing and carving my signature stamp, this past weekend I <br/>
went out and found my first letterbox. I am writing this post <br/>
because my experience has left me completely unimpressed.  The <br/>
directions provided by the placer were clear and I had no trouble <br/>
locating the box. It is what I found inside the box that has <br/>
thwarted my enthusiasm.  <br/>
<br/>
Inside the box were a logbook, pen, and letter explaining <br/>
letterboxing--just as I expected.  Of course, there was also a <br/>
stamp, but definitely not as expected.  The stamp that I found was a <br/>
store-bought stamp!  In fact, the placer did not even bother to take <br/>
the price tag off ($5.99).  Oh well, I thought, it was probably an <br/>
exception to what I assumed was the "art" of letterboxingdesigning <br/>
and carving distinctive one-of-a-kind stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
So I made a print in my book that I had just bought, and went to put <br/>
my stamp in their logbook.  Of course, I wanted to flip through the <br/>
book first to see who had come before.  This is what really <br/>
disenchants me.  Of seven stamps already placed in this logbook, all <br/>
seven were store-bought stamps!  There is no mistake that these were <br/>
indeed completely unoriginal off-the-shelf stamps.  Since the box's <br/>
placement in May, seven stamps had been placed and none were <br/>
original.  <br/>
<br/>
I was truly disillusioned.  How else can I explain it.  I thought I <br/>
was getting into a wonderfully creative pastime.  I envisioned going <br/>
on these letterboxing hunts on a grand road trip all across the <br/>
country.  I had already bought supplies to carve many unique stamps <br/>
that I intended to place on this trip.  But after my first located <br/>
box, I was frustrated to say the least.  I really see no <br/>
creativeness or imagination in buying a stamp to put in your box.  <br/>
Worse yet, I don't see why someone would be satisfied seeking out a <br/>
box just to leave an image that is not unique to them.  One can go <br/>
to the local craft store and fill a book with all the pre-made <br/>
designs they want-so what?  I truly thought letterboxing was about <br/>
sharing a unique treasure with those inclined to seek ita treasure <br/>
that we would not be able to find by any other means. <br/>
<br/>
  Some might say that the value of the hobby comes from the <br/>
experience of finding the box, not what's inside.  Maybe this has <br/>
merit, but I also have to mention that there was nothing striking <br/>
about the box's placement either.  The box was located in a city <br/>
park mere yards from the parking lot.  I stood at the box location <br/>
and could read the license plate on my car.    The box and other <br/>
supplies (including the stamp) could have been purchased in the <br/>
shopping plaza not even three miles away.  However, I guess it is <br/>
best that I did not invest time or effort finding a box in which the <br/>
placer invested no originality in placing.  I suppose I may be even <br/>
more disappointed if I had hiked miles and followed complex <br/>
directions to find this miserable box.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm trying not to rant too much about this, because I would like <br/>
honest feedback.  Maybe I've just had a bad first experience.  Maybe <br/>
the 8 instances that I saw of store-bought stamps are all exceptions <br/>
to the hobby.  Or maybe I was expecting too much.<br/>

Hmmmm Not ALL of us can get away with being professional art snobs,<br/>
let alone "professional letterboxers" though the thought crosses my<br/>
mind daily, I don't mind the idea of a store bought stamp or a custom<br/>
crafted stamp if it is appropriate for the location and box.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, I have actually found quite a mix of hand-crafted<br/>
masterpieces mixed in with store-bought and some rather crude<br/>
creations too, but it's not the reason that I box.<br/>
<br/>
However, you'll NEVER find a store bought stamp in ANY of my boxes.<br/>

<br/>
Not being an Art Critic keeps me from critiquing others attempts at carving<br/>
or not carving.<br/>
<br/>
Not being an Artist keeps me from creating "The Perfect Hand Carved Stamp"!<br/>
(tm)<br/>
<br/>
Not being a Professional letterboxer keeps me from assuming anything.<br/>
<br/>
Not being anything but myself keeps me from worrying to much about how this<br/>
hobby is done.<br/>
<br/>
I carve my own stamps. My first signature stamp was store-bought.  My<br/>
current signature stamp is hand carved.  I've found both hand carved and<br/>
store bought stamps.  Both are wonderful for me.  It stamp is not the reason<br/>
I box. It is to get outside with my family and my dogs (If we are at a place<br/>
that allows dogs) and see something we wouldn't normally see, be it nothing<br/>
more than a trail through a wooded area we didn't know existed.<br/>
<br/>
Try this.......<br/>
<br/>
Relax. Seek each box for the feeling you get when you've deciphered a set of<br/>
clues and have successfully discovered the treasure whether that treasure be<br/>
a golden doubloon or a steel penny.  Enjoy the day when you box. Enjoy the<br/>
scenery.  Live life and realize that there are a ton of better things to get<br/>
worked up over and worried about.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The first two boxes I ever found had store bought stamps.   I was thrilled <br/>
with both of them.<br/>
<br/>
One of my plants had (It's since disappeared.   I think the squirrels got it) <br/>
a store-bought stamp.   It was exactly what I wanted for that box, and beyond <br/>
my ability to carve.   I noted on the clues, so if it was that important to <br/>
someone, they didn't have to go after it.<br/>
<br/>
My personal stamp is store bought.   I got it originally just so I could get <br/>
out there and get boxing fast.   Then, when I got to where I could think about <br/>
carving one, I'd gotten attached to the one I had.   It was "me," you know?   <br/>
So I added a few embellishments with colored pencils, to make it more unique, <br/>
but it's still the same basic design.<br/>
<br/>
Despite these handicaps, I'm having a wonderful time with letterboxing. <g><br/>

Letterboxing is a lot of things to a lot of people. <br/>
For some it is the art and creativity of the carving. <br/>
For some it is the thrill of the hunt.<br/>
For some it is the time spent with friends and family.<br/>
For some it is sharing beautiful places and amazing sights to behold.<br/>
For some it is meeting new people.<br/>
For some it is puzzles and mysteries.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure where you got your information about letterboxing, but it is SO <br/>
much more than carving stamps.<br/>

After designing and carving my signature stamp, this past weekend I <br/>
went out and found my first letterbox. I am writing this post <br/>
because my experience has left me completely unimpressed.  The <br/>
directions provided by the placer were clear and I had no trouble <br/>
locating the box. It is what I found inside the box that has <br/>
thwarted my enthusiasm.  <br/>
<br/>
Inside the box were a logbook, pen, and letter explaining <br/>
letterboxing--just as I expected.  Of course, there was also a <br/>
stamp, but definitely not as expected.  The stamp that I found was a <br/>
store-bought stamp!  In fact, the placer did not even bother to take <br/>
the price tag off ($5.99).  Oh well, I thought, it was probably an <br/>
exception to what I assumed was the "art" of letterboxing—designing <br/>
and carving distinctive one-of-a-kind stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
So I made a print in my book that I had just bought, and went to put <br/>
my stamp in their logbook.  Of course, I wanted to flip through the <br/>
book first to see who had come before.  This is what really <br/>
disenchants me.  Of seven stamps already placed in this logbook, all <br/>
seven were store-bought stamps!  There is no mistake that these were <br/>
indeed completely unoriginal off-the-shelf stamps.  Since the box's <br/>
placement in May, seven stamps had been placed and none were <br/>
original.  <br/>
<br/>
I was truly disillusioned.  How else can I explain it.  I thought I <br/>
was getting into a wonderfully creative pastime.  I envisioned going <br/>
on these letterboxing hunts on a grand road trip all across the <br/>
country.  I had already bought supplies to carve many unique stamps <br/>
that I intended to place on this trip.  But after my first located <br/>
box, I was frustrated to say the least.  I really see no <br/>
creativeness or imagination in buying a stamp to put in your box.  <br/>
Worse yet, I don't see why someone would be satisfied seeking out a <br/>
box just to leave an image that is not unique to them.  One can go <br/>
to the local craft store and fill a book with all the pre-made <br/>
designs they want—-so what?  I truly thought letterboxing was about <br/>
sharing a unique treasure with those inclined to seek it—a treasure <br/>
that we would not be able to find by any other means. <br/>
<br/>
  Some might say that the value of the hobby comes from the <br/>
experience of finding the box, not what's inside.  Maybe this has <br/>
merit, but I also have to mention that there was nothing striking <br/>
about the box's placement either.  The box was located in a city <br/>
park mere yards from the parking lot.  I stood at the box location <br/>
and could read the license plate on my car.    The box and other <br/>
supplies (including the stamp) could have been purchased in the <br/>
shopping plaza not even three miles away.  However, I guess it is <br/>
best that I did not invest time or effort finding a box in which the <br/>
placer invested no originality in placing.  I suppose I may be even <br/>
more disappointed if I had hiked miles and followed complex <br/>
directions to find this miserable box.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm trying not to rant too much about this, because I would like <br/>

the 8 instances that I saw of store-bought stamps are all exceptions <br/>

Others have confessed to me that they shouldn't be holding sharp object lest they draw a quart of blood.  A lot of children play in the hobby, too, and shouldn't have blades.  Some very young ones may chose spots and have their friends find the box, too.<br/>
<br/>
However, these folks often play to *their* strengths, by devising great clues or finding special places to send folks.  Others create new inventions, like hitchhikers, urban microboxes, postal letterboxes and letterbooks (Diane and my specialty!).<br/>
<br/>
We're a polyglot bunch, and each has something to bring to the game.  If you're a fair hand at carving, then maybe we'll be seeing some neat pieces coming out.  There's some INCREDIBLE stamps out there which put me to shame (but I know I used some nice places, so I don't feel bad at all)!<br/>

Despair not!  The craft improves with each passing day!  Where are you from?  Maybe we can collectively lue you into some hot rubberwork.<br/>

   It sounds to me like you were disappointed because you see the <br/>
potential for so much more in this pastime. That is great! <br/>
Incorporate that vision into some boxes of your own. Some will <br/>
appreciate them, some won't. Some even prefer my crude handcarved <br/>
stamps to storebought (and some don't). The more boxes I find, the <br/>
more I appreciate different styles. And a great handcarved stamp is <br/>
even more of a treat when you aren't expecting to find one in every <br/>
box. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I made a print in my book that I had just bought, and went to <br/>
put <br/>

going <br/>

&gt; box, I was frustrated to say the least.  I really see no <br/>
&gt; creativeness or imagination in buying a stamp to put in your box.  <br/>
&gt; Worse yet, I don't see why someone would be satisfied seeking out a <br/>

&gt; and could read the license plate on my car.    The box and other <br/>
&gt; supplies (including the stamp) could have been purchased in the <br/>
&gt; shopping plaza not even three miles away.  However, I guess it is <br/>
&gt; best that I did not invest time or effort finding a box in which <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; placer invested no originality in placing.  I suppose I may be even <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm trying not to rant too much about this, because I would like <br/>

<br/>
it is sad you feel that way...i just started myself and in a number of articles and 'how to begin" they say to start and if you can't carve get something anyway until you carve and join in the fun. you make it like it is a competition and maybe some of us work about 65 hours a week and haven't had the time to carve. i travel about 16 days a month and last time i checked, the airlines wouldn't let me carry an exacto knife on the plane!!  i never respond to any of these emails but i felt compelled this time... do you think LESS of me because i have a store bought stamp, and, it is from an antique store from a trip to CA so isn't that unique enough? this should be about the fun, the adventure, the exploring new parks, places, locations<br/>
<br/>
live life and don't get wrapped up the simple things<br/>

about the experience.  We went to a 15-20 acre park that is 2 BLOCKS <br/>

things I seem to remember about the rules is, there  are none. Just <br/>
good impressions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Only recently had I discovered through the internet the hobby of <br/>
&gt; letterboxing.  Especially intrigued by letterboxing.org, I could <br/>
not <br/>
&gt; wait to start locating boxes, designing stamps, and placing my <br/>
own.  <br/>
&gt; After designing and carving my signature stamp, this past weekend I <br/>
&gt; went out and found my first letterbox. I am writing this post <br/>
&gt; because my experience has left me completely unimpressed.  The <br/>
&gt; directions provided by the placer were clear and I had no trouble <br/>
&gt; locating the box. It is what I found inside the box that has <br/>
&gt; thwarted my enthusiasm.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Inside the box were a logbook, pen, and letter explaining <br/>
&gt; letterboxing--just as I expected.  Of course, there was also a <br/>
&gt; stamp, but definitely not as expected.  The stamp that I found was <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; store-bought stamp!  In fact, the placer did not even bother to <br/>
take <br/>
&gt; the price tag off ($5.99).  Oh well, I thought, it was probably an <br/>
&gt; exception to what I assumed was the "art" of letterboxingdesigning <br/>
&gt; and carving distinctive one-of-a-kind stamps.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I made a print in my book that I had just bought, and went to <br/>
put <br/>
&gt; my stamp in their logbook.  Of course, I wanted to flip through the <br/>
&gt; book first to see who had come before.  This is what really <br/>
&gt; disenchants me.  Of seven stamps already placed in this logbook, <br/>
all <br/>
&gt; seven were store-bought stamps!  There is no mistake that these <br/>
were <br/>
&gt; indeed completely unoriginal off-the-shelf stamps.  Since the box's <br/>
&gt; placement in May, seven stamps had been placed and none were <br/>
&gt; original.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was truly disillusioned.  How else can I explain it.  I thought I <br/>
&gt; was getting into a wonderfully creative pastime.  I envisioned <br/>
going <br/>
&gt; on these letterboxing hunts on a grand road trip all across the <br/>
&gt; country.  I had already bought supplies to carve many unique stamps <br/>
&gt; that I intended to place on this trip.  But after my first located <br/>
&gt; box, I was frustrated to say the least.  I really see no <br/>
&gt; creativeness or imagination in buying a stamp to put in your box.  <br/>
&gt; Worse yet, I don't see why someone would be satisfied seeking out a <br/>
&gt; box just to leave an image that is not unique to them.  One can go <br/>
&gt; to the local craft store and fill a book with all the pre-made <br/>
&gt; designs they want-so what?  I truly thought letterboxing was about <br/>
&gt; sharing a unique treasure with those inclined to seek ita treasure <br/>
&gt; that we would not be able to find by any other means. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Some might say that the value of the hobby comes from the <br/>
&gt; experience of finding the box, not what's inside.  Maybe this has <br/>
&gt; merit, but I also have to mention that there was nothing striking <br/>
&gt; about the box's placement either.  The box was located in a city <br/>
&gt; park mere yards from the parking lot.  I stood at the box location <br/>
&gt; and could read the license plate on my car.    The box and other <br/>
&gt; supplies (including the stamp) could have been purchased in the <br/>
&gt; shopping plaza not even three miles away.  However, I guess it is <br/>
&gt; best that I did not invest time or effort finding a box in which <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; placer invested no originality in placing.  I suppose I may be even <br/>
&gt; more disappointed if I had hiked miles and followed complex <br/>
&gt; directions to find this miserable box.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm trying not to rant too much about this, because I would like <br/>
&gt; honest feedback.  Maybe I've just had a bad first experience.  <br/>
Maybe <br/>
&gt; the 8 instances that I saw of store-bought stamps are all <br/>
exceptions <br/>
&gt; to the hobby.  Or maybe I was expecting too much.<br/>

We took off from Cincinnati as a team on Saturday at 6:15 a.m. and, after finding 28 boxes and 2 HH's, 250 miles later, returned home at 8 p.m. thrilled by the day, the finds, the comraderie, the meeting up with Cardinal mom and Bigguy on the other side of Ohio, and the challenge. We hit more parks and historic sites than we would have ever attempted years past, but boxing is something else! Glad you liked it. Snowbird<br/>
