missing the last time I tried.  This time Success!!! However, finding <br/>
the Rapallo Viaduct box was a different story-- I looked for two <br/>
hours to no avail.  The birdhouse with the 1 1/2 on it was lying at <br/>
the base of the bank all smashed. A post back near May 10 reported <br/>
trouble as well. Someone else said to forget finding a path, just to <br/>
go back over the Viaduct towards E.Hampton and find the green water <br/>
pipe.  I wish I had read that b4 I went out today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I <br/>
know where that pipe is!! GEE Whiz!!!! Oh well, I wore the Toad Dog <br/>
out( no easy feat) since we parked at the South box and walked to <br/>
Rapollo-- I'm tired. Good Night!--sunshine :0)<br/>
