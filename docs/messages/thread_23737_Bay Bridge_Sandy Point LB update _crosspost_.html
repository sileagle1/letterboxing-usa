                    <div class="plaintext-content">A few weeks ago a very kind geocacher wrote this list to say they'd discovered a LB while on <br/>
vacation in Maryland. It was in bad shape, but the stamp was still there. When they later <br/>
investigated the box clue, they noticed it had last been heard from in 2004, and that the <br/>
placer could no longer be contacted.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to locate and refurbish the box this morning. It now has the original stamp, a new <br/>
logbook (the old one was ruined), and a much better container. I will apply with Choi at LBNA <br/>
to adopt the box.<br/>
<br/>
It is in its original place, and the original clues still apply, although there are one or two <br/>
references I will update once Choi and I work out the adoption.<br/>
<br/>
The carver/placer was Monkeyshine, who it seems only planted this one box. The box now <br/>
contains an additional stamp that commemorates its rescue by that kind cacher, <br/>
Moore9KSUcats. Enjoy!<br/>
