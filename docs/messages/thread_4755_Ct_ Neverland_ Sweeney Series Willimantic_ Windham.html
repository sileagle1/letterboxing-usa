<div>The Ship to Neverland Letterbox</div>
<div>Sweeney School Series</div>
<div>Rated easy</div>
<div>Planted 3/21/02  by : Leader of the 
Pack</div>

<div>In Windham take Rte 6  by Walmart and the 
airport out to Rte 203. Take a right at the light on 203. Just a short distance 
up the road on the Right is a Joshua's Trust Property  the Windham Atlantic 
White Cedar Bog . Park here there is room for several cars. Plan over 1 
hour for the walk which is on old railroad bed straight and smooth. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The box: </div>
<div>      The window  on 
the balcony was open the summer breeze wafted through the curtains,lifting 
them  lightly ,to drop  against the frame and sill.  The large 
moon cast beams of  light down onto the beds and sleeping children. The 
light was broken by a shadow  and the silouette of a mysterious ship passed 
over the face of the moon.  The Neverland ship for lost boys. Adventure if 
you follow, youthful wars of play, daring feats, mermaids, indians and pirates. 
The children followed.</div>
<div>      Down the  lane 
where  engines chugged in times past in pursuit of the ship to 
Neverland.  Passing a sign pointing out the bog. Water and  haunted 
looking trees everywhere. Down the lane, pass a place where ledges cling to both 
sides   keep going by the trees and  swamps. Watch for wildlife 
this is a safe place for the wild creatures to watch the  ship pass 
by.   Walk on  you will pass small side roads to nowhere keep to 
the straight . The wind billows the sails and the ship flies onward  it 
comes to a yellow gate and the  rudder drawn so the ship veers around to 
come back. Hook must be beyond the gate where the path turns hard and 
black.  So turn with the ship and face where you came from . Look on the 
right at one of natures wonders. High in the lofty masts out to sea at the right 
is a nest . Not a crows nest of the ship but  Great Blue Herons DO NOT 
DISTURB! Hook is their friend.  Now onward as the ship sails toward home 
and the dawn. Pass on the right a hard to notice tree that beavers chewed long 
ago now black and dead.  Then on the left a  tree branch  reaches 
out to  swing at the passing ship - evergreen  even in night.  
Now as you dream  away the night keep your eye to the right as the  
Neverland ship cast off a treasure which now lies below  the rim of  a 
black circle. Return home children and chase the dream  ship another night 
through childhood and open windows. </div>
<div>      Stamp or sign 
in  privately and rehide the box so others may enjoy the 
search.</div></body></html>
