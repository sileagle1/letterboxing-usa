<div>Tom, Eric, and Susan,</div>
<div>    I have an older Brother in 
Vermont who seems pretty psyched by my stories of Letterboxing and the growth 
potential in Vermont.  He has been talking it up with a shop he frequents 
quite often and they are hooked.  The shop is called "The Fly Rod 
Shop" and is in Stowe,VT.  The owners are "Sumner Stowe" and 
"Dan Noyes".  From what I gather, Sumner is the one who is all 
fired up and wants every bit of detail she can get so they can get involved thru 
their shop.  I figured your location was much closer than mine in Rhode 
Island, and perhaps you could get in touch with them to help them get 
started.  Their e-mail address is <a href="mailto:angler@flyrodshop.com">angler@flyrodshop.com</a> and they have a 
web address of <a href="http://www.flyrodshop.com">www.flyrodshop.com</a>.  
Also, their phone #'s are 802-253-7346 or 800-535-9763.  </div>

<div>Thanks</div>
