                    <div class="plaintext-content">On a wonderful, bright, warm Easter weekend, a new Letterbox was hidden. It <br/>
is located at the Ragged Mountain Memorial Preserve which straddles <br/>
Southington and New Britain. To get there, take 91 South or North to Rt 9 <br/>
North. Take the left exit marked Rt 372. Continue all the way to the lights <br/>
at the end of the long exit. Turn left onto Rt 71A. Travel 1.4 miles and turn <br/>
right onto West Lane. Proceed 6/10 of a mile to a small parking area on the <br/>
right hand side. <br/>
<br/>
Find and follow the trail markers that are blue with red dots. Stay to the <br/>
left all the way up. You will quickly gain elevation and be rewarded with <br/>
some of the best views seldom seen anywhere else. This hike can take either 1 <br/>
1/2 to 2 hrs (out and back) depending on your time spent enjoying the awesome <br/>
view, or if you choose you can take a 6 mile long loop that will take 3 1/2 <br/>
hrs or more. <br/>
<br/>
Approximately 45 minutes into the hike you will come upon a large tower of <br/>
rock that has peeled itself away from the main cliff. It seems to defy <br/>
gravity and appears to be held in place by a large rectangular boulder wedged <br/>
between the tower and the cliff. To get the best view of this you should find <br/>
a "seat" in the rocks on a flat ledge that faces the tower in front and <br/>
slightly to the left of you.<br/>
<br/>
The letterbox is hidden above your head in a cairn nestled in the split of <br/>
the rocks.<br/>
<br/>
This is near the trail itself so secretly stamp in and replace as found. <br/>
<br/>
To get the best view on this hike, continue along the red dotted blue trail <br/>
for approx. 10 to 15 minutes more and you will come to the "head" of the <br/>
trail. This is a popular (but illegal) area for the rock climbing community. <br/>
This also is a great place for another box but on this day, there just wasn't <br/>
time. At this point you must make a decision. Either turn back the way you <br/>
came, or continue on the "loop" (look down on the rocks for the directional <br/>
signal) for the LONG way home. Just remember, at this point you will be on <br/>
both the standard blue blazed Metacomet trail (map 28 of the Connecticut Walk <br/>
Book) until you find the second directional signal on the rocks. It will show <br/>
you the way along the red dotted blue trail. This way IS long. Bring plenty <br/>
of water and a snack. You will not be disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy<br/>
