<br/>
In 2000 a series of boxes was placed at Oxbow Park in Gresham, OR. There<br/>
placer has since fallen out of the letterboxing scene. Since I placed a<br/>
series of boxes out there as well, I adopted the box that remained. I had<br/>
printed the clues from the web site back in September. Since then the clues<br/>
had been pulled. I retyped the clues from what I had printed.<br/>
<br/>
The set I had only listed 2 boxes.. and indicated that box 2 was missing.<br/>
Well, someone was out this last weekend and came upon a box that says box 4<br/>
in the Oxbow series. My question to the list is this, does anyone possibly<br/>
have the original clues for all 4 boxes? If so I'd like to go out and<br/>
confirm their existance and then add them to the clues I've adopted. It<br/>
would be a sad thing to have boxes out there that are not being visited for<br/>
lack of clues. Especially clues to carvings as wonderful as box 1 was.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I searched through the archives for 2 hours. I found the original 2<br/>
boxes posted but couldn't find boxes 3 and 4.<br/>
