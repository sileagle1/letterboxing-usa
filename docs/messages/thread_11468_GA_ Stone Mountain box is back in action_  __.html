Mark--who lives nearby--a version 2.0 of the stamp and he's been kind <br/>
enough to rehide the letterbox for you poor, letterbox-starved-and-<br/>
deprived boxers to enjoy very close to its original location.  (The <br/>
original location no longer functions as a hiding place.)<br/>
<br/>
Webmaster: The URL needs to be updated to point to <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/GA/StoneMountain<br/>
<br/>
(Make sure you update the "Stone Mountain Park" link with one <br/>
letterbox--not the "Stone Mountain" link with three boxes.  Those <br/>
three I have nothing to do with.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, Mark!  I can't wait until I get out there next month to <br/>
nab my own box!!!!  =)<br/>
