<br/>
For those who really like being FIRST to get a box, we just wanted to <br/>
say that one of our boxes has been out for over a month now and still <br/>
has had no visitors!  (as of yesterday anyway)<br/>
<br/>
Also, for those of you interested in hitchhikers, we do try to keep a <br/>
pretty steady stream of travellers passing through our boxes, often <br/>
as many as half a dozen at any given time.  However, if they get stuck <br/>
in one place for too long, we just might have to take them to NJ or <br/>
something!  [  :-)  ]   Also, theres always the possibility of <br/>
finding an unlisted surprise, like Wandas first attempt at a <br/>
hand-carved stamp (The Nurse Log).  So, its up to you to figure out <br/>
just where these things might be!<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>
<br/>
Wanda a<br/>
