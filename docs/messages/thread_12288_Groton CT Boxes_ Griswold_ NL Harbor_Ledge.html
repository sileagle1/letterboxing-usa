for a short trip this afternoon and found Fort Griswold, NL Harbor <br/>
and NL Ledge lights. Fort Griswold was pretty damp and the baggie in <br/>
side was in poor shape. I only had 1 spare bag so I put the logbook <br/>
in it, resealed tightly and hid it well.  The logbook, by the way, <br/>
is filled to the brim and has been since last fall.  We added a few <br/>
blank pages but they are not in the book securely, so I think a book <br/>
2 is definately in order.  I may try to put a #2 book in it this <br/>
weekend if we have time.<br/>
<br/>
Found the NL Harbor and NL Ledge boxes in fine condition and got a <br/>
bonus at NL Harbor (The Beaver Crew HH, which has a LOT of visits in <br/>
it!) <br/>
<br/>
We were headed to Bluff point and Haley Farm but it was VERY windy <br/>
out and we got sick of running after the clues when the wind yanked <br/>
them from our hands!   <br/>
