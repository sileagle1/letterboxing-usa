For someone who can 'appreciate an April Fools like the next <br/>
person', I should think you'd know better than to try to debunk the <br/>
joke until AFTER April Fools.  Sure seems like everyone on this <br/>
board appreciates the joke more than you do, though.<br/>
<br/>
And, parodies are protected under law.  Good thing too, because <br/>
otherwise it would put late-night talk show hosts out of buisness.  <br/>
(And I love my Leno!)<br/>
<br/>
Think of it as free publicity and enjoy it while it lasts.<br/>

It is easier now to see though where some of the attitude comes from <br/>
between geocachers and letterboxers.  We're all sitting here having a <br/>
good chuckle over a harmless prank and you are claiming you've been <br/>
violated.  Can't we just slap each other on the back and get along?<br/>
<br/>
We have fun playing our game, do you?<br/>

HI, Jeremy,<br/>
<br/>
Please pardon me for jumping in here...<br/>
<br/>
I don't know you, and I may not be the brightest bulb in the string, <br/>
but if it's really causing a lot of confusion, can't a webmaster <br/>
just add some splash to the GC homepage to debunk the joke?  Or just <br/>
make one grand announcement on your list?  I can't imagine anyone <br/>
technologically adept being unable to find a quick way to spread the <br/>
word that it's just a joke. If this is causing you labor pains, you <br/>
might just be having a cow.  <br/>
<br/>
Whatever you manage to collect from the invoice, invest it in a <br/>
sense of humor.  OR...  put your intellectual energies into <br/>
creative, harmless retribution. <heh heh=""><br/>
<br/>
Oooops, I think I just committed an act of LB treason.<br/>
<br/>
Nevermind!<br/>
<br/>
;-)<br/>

I think this is very ironic! After all, wasn't it Mr. Irish who, <br/>
after taking over the Geocaching website, "borrowed" some of the <br/>
clues off of the LBNA website, leaving off important caveats like <br/>
cautions for children where there were some dangerous areas involved? <br/>
Read the flame wars from back in the day.<br/>
<br/>
What about the "intellectual property" of the LBNA and it's clues <br/>
then? I don't think it's fair to want it both ways!<br/>
