However, I take offense that I'm a newbie letterboxer (I've been boxing for <br/>
just over two years).  I've found over 2000 letterboxes.  I'm pretty sure that <br/>
I wouldn't be considered a newbie.  In fact, wouldn't this mean that every <br/>
letterboxer in the United States, who didn't participate in England before 1998, <br/>
would be considered a newbie?????<br/>

As we have been letterboxing (in one way or another) for 150years here in England, anyone not native to our small island should be considered a newbie !!! lol<br/>

Now i'll just sit back and wait for the proverbial to hit the fan ! lol<br/>

As we have been letterboxing (in one way or another) for 150years here in England, anyone not native to our small island should be considered a newbie !!! lol<br/>
<br/>
Now i'll just sit back and wait for the proverbial to hit the fan ! lol<br/>

However, I take offense that I'm a newbie letterboxer (I've been boxing for <br/>
just over two years).  I've found over 2000 letterboxes.  I'm pretty sure that <br/>
I wouldn't be considered a newbie.  In fact, wouldn't this mean that every <br/>
letterboxer in the United States, who didn't participate in England before 1998, <br/>
would be considered a newbie?????<br/>

The new guy is supposed to get all the unpleasant assignments. He told me that <br/>
a person is the new guy until a new new guy is hired. Since no one had been <br/>
hired for two years he had been the new guy for a long time. Unfortunately for <br/>
him while I was the new new guy he had been the new guy for so long he was <br/>
referred to as the old new guy as still got stuck with a lot of crap. I was good <br/>
at hiding and everyone was used to dumping on him. If this seems like a <br/>
digression well maybe too much emphasis is being placed on tenure.<br/>

Did you go to any of those locations?  They are a good place to <br/>

typos.<br/>
