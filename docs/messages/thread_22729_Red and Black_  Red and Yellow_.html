Is the way it is supposed to be according to<br/>

lol! He had the way I heard it as way off, which was "red touch black stay<br/>
back". I generally try to "stay back" from ALL snakes though, lol!<br/>

Yellow and black, step in a crack.<br/>
If you step in a crack you break your mothers back.<br/>
If you break your mothers back, have you any wool?<br/>
If you haven't any wool,go wee, wee wee all the way home.<br/>
If you go wee, wee, wee all the way home someone is going to huff and <br/>
puff and blow the snake to heck.<br/>

Why would anyone want to mess with any snake regardless of it's <br/>
coloring? Just leave it be, unless it has 2 inch fangs imbedded into <br/>
your leg.<br/>
<br/>
FYI for letterboxers that hike with dogs. Vets now have an <br/>
innoculation for rattlesnake venom. It is administered prior to being <br/>
bitten, and requires a yearly shot(innoculation). I'm not sure that it <br/>
works with the Mojave Green Rattler, but most of you don't have that <br/>
nasty little critter. Cost is $17 plus office visit. That is a heck of <br/>
a lot cheaper than the price of anti venom. <br/>
