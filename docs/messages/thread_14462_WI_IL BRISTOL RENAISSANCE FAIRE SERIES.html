                    <div class="plaintext-content">Heads up, WI/IL boxers!  This series is a lot of fun!  We scored all <br/>
nine boxes today and were really surprized to find ourselves the <br/>
first finders of about half of them.  The others had maybe three <br/>
finders, tops. On the drive home, Kate and I pondered the reasons for <br/>
the slow start for such a fine letterboxing experience.  I'd like to <br/>
take a second to address them.<br/>
1) THE RENAISSANCE FAIRE IS FINE...IF YOU HAPPEN TO OWN LEATHER <br/>
PANTALOONS AND AREN'T AFRAID OF WEARING THEM IN PUBLIC.  Well, yes, <br/>
that's true for some people, but that doesn't go for everybody.  <br/>
Normal, modern-day clothes are just fine for guests of the Faire.  So <br/>
you may continue to wear your leather pantaloons in undisturbed <br/>
privacy if you're so inclined.<br/>
2)  THE ADMISSION COST IS KINDA STEEP, ISN'T IT?  Not if you consider <br/>
the many forms of entertainment that come with the price of a ticket: <br/>
comedy shows, jousting, a falconry exhibition, a 20 minute sprint <br/>
thru "Hamlet", many excellent musical acts, and then there's always <br/>
the people-watching.  The folks in the leather pantaloons tend to put <br/>
on a good show.<br/>
3)  BUT, BUT... YOU HAVE TO CONFRONT THE PERFORMERS TO GET THE <br/>
BOXES.  THAT'S A ONE-WAY TICKET TO IMPROV HELL!!!  Not necessarily.  <br/>
I can only speak of my experience, but every single person seemed <br/>
genuinely pleased to share their stamp with us.  No one used it as an <br/>
excuse to make us the butt of a joke or toss us into the iron maiden <br/>
or anything.<br/>
So do check out this series, everyone! The stamps are very nice and <br/>
it's so much FUN!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the Dragon for giving us a letterboxing experience like no <br/>
other.<br/>
