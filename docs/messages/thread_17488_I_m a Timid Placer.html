<br/>
I'm finding out what a timid person I am when it comes to hunting and<br/>
placing boxes in urban areas. My first box was placed conveniently<br/>
in the middle of nowhere. I now have two boxes I want to plant here<br/>
in urban Las Vegas but I'm finding myself petrified even scouting<br/>
locations.<br/>
<br/>
One spot is not in a "good area"," although it's the right area for<br/>
this box. I find myself not comfortable placing the box, nor leading<br/>
people to it. It's very frustrating. The other box I am having a<br/>
similar hard time finding the right spot for and the right time of <br/>
day to place it.<br/>
<br/>
One of the issues is desert landscaping! We don't have nooks and<br/>
crannies or a lot of hollowed out tree trunks. We have like one rock<br/>
sitting by itself in the middle of a bunch of crushed rock.<br/>
<br/>
Can you help me? I need some stories and advice on how you've placed <br/>
boxes in cities to give me the courage to get up and do what needs to <br/>
be done (or maybe I just need some Powdermilk Biscuits...heaven's <br/>
they're tasty!).  Good letterboxing ahead if I can ever get over this <br/>
hurdle.<br/>

&gt; and placing boxes in urban areas.<br/>
<br/>
The key to hiding a good urban box is size: Small is good!  A film <br/>
cannister is MUCH easier to find a hiding place for than the normal <br/>
sized letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I now have two boxes I want to plant here<br/>
&gt; in urban Las Vegas but I'm finding myself petrified even scouting<br/>
&gt; locations.<br/>
<br/>
Where there can be 'security concerns', such as the strip in Las <br/>
Vegas, you might want to consider not hiding any letterbox.  Not <br/>
only is it extremely difficult to be discreet in such a public <br/>
location, but anyone finding it by accident might call in the bomb <br/>
squad!  Although I'm sure some people would hide a box on the Strip <br/>
just to say they did it.  They love the challenge of hiding a box in <br/>
a 'challenging' location.<br/>
<br/>
Another option is something that forces letterboxers to go where you <br/>
want them to, but then have the box somewhere else.  Like with my <br/>
walking tour series, I lead people from plaque to plaque that <br/>
eventually tell them where the letterbox is actually located--which <br/>
doesn't have to be in the same high-traffic area I led them to in <br/>
the first place.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't sound like you're a particularly experienced letterboxer--<br/>
which is okay, we all started there, after all!--but as you find <br/>
more boxes, you get new ideas for how to hide clever boxes in places <br/>
you originally thought were impossible to do.  Experienced does help <br/>
tremendously in such high-traffic areas.<br/>

<br/>
it gets easier to plant...everytime u go somewheres you start to think "hhmmm..this would be a good place to hide a letterbox"...one place i hid one i visited the place 3 times before the perfect hiding spot finally popped up and said heres the spot!!<br/>
<br/>
I do hope you hide one on the strip somewheres.or mayb just a few steps off there..need more there...just be sure to be discreet and not do it in an area that is landscaped regularly and that can be moved..ie benches....and small does seem to the operative word for someplace on the strip....i would plant one there but i hate to not be able to maintain it...<br/>
<br/>
and dont forget if u are near a restarea to think about one there for people passing thru town....<br/>
<br/>
good luck and hope you find the perfect spot .....<br/>

<br/>
One thing you might want to keep in mind is that if you are timid about going into a certain area of town, then chances are others will be too. Always think about safety! I'd hate for someone to get mugged while searching for my letterbox in a place they would not have gone otherwise.<br/>
Also, like Ryan said, security these days is tougher. If someone sees you placing a small box in a hidden area, they might assume the worst.<br/>
Not that I'm trying to discourage you, just keep this kinda thing in mind.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not familiar with desert settings. I love my eastern woods and fields, so I'm not sure how you could proceed in hiding boxes there. Some other people on this board have used fake or hollowed out rocks. That might be an option. Hobby stores should have what you need, as well as advice on how to build them.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and keep us posted! I love Vegas, and hope to get there soon. Even better if I have boxes to look for!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">O tell me, Have you tried that Powdermilk?  Are there a lot of bachelor Norwegian farmers in Nevada?  There's been some good ideas brought forth so far.  Fifth, even.  Colored duct tape is a lovely, useful thing.  I expect sandpaper may be a good camouflage, too.  Magnets are great attachers, but beware the placement that makes people bend TOO far over, into an attention-grabbing position!  If one could put a microbox under a stair such that one could sit on the stair at their leisure and reach quietly underneath it for the goods, all the better.  I enjoyed a great one like that (but I won't spoil it with details!).  Sometimes I wonder if police think we're making a 'pickup'...<br/>
<br/>
But your fears are also mine - the dangers of the City.  I have a very good idea for an urban microbox in Providence, rI, but it comes on the heels of being a juror on a murder case that drew attention to just how close a number of people in different parts of the downtown came to being killed that night.  I'll STRONGLY advise anyone to stick to daytime urban boxing.  And I grew up in Jersey!<br/>
