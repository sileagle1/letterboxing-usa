<br/>
Finally had a full decent-weather weekend (despite weather forecasts <br/>
for Saturday) and we were able to get out to the woods.<br/>
<br/>
After a late start on Saturday, Binx and I finished up the Time <br/>
Travels Series in the Blue Hills and finally found Hancock Hill <br/>
Letterbox with a tip from russell.<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday we found Marathon, Piece of Cake, Bonsai, Massachussetts <br/>
Wolf Mystery, Hunter's Falls (made us a little nervouse due to <br/>
private property postings), Tangled Woods (also a bit nervy being in <br/>
a rather public spot!), and Angel's Lookout at Peppercorn Point.<br/>
<br/>
All boxes were in good condition. The Wolf Mystery had water in the <br/>
box but the contents were saved by the ziplocs.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who placed these boxes!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails!<br/>

Don't fear.  The Board of Directors knows about the box.<br/>

Can't say I didn't warn you!<br/>

You are welcome!  You got all of mine except for Peace on Earth <br/>
(which, BTW, seems to be a magnet for HHs).  I try to maintain the <br/>
boxes every few months.  Piece of Cake is technically not my box, but <br/>
the original planter has gone onto other adventures, so I <br/>
have "adopted" this box for its care and feeding.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you had fun!<br/>
