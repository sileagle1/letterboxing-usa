<br/>
WE'RE THERE! According to the poll results, we are good to go on the <br/>
patch AND decal order. So feel free to SEND ME YOUR MONEY!!!! I <br/>
reconfirmed all the details with the embroidery company; as soon as I <br/>
have all the orders and money in, all it takes is a phone call from <br/>
me (and my credit card).<br/>
<br/>
Print out the order form and follow the instructions. It's that easy!<br/>
<br/>
ORDERING DEADLINE: Have your order to me by February 20, 2001.<br/>
<br/>
WHERE CAN I FIND THE ORDER FORM? Go to www.letterboxing.org  Click <br/>
on "NEW" at top of page. Click on "Patches Order Form".<br/>
<br/>
THINK ABOUT THIS: Consider ordering an extra patch or decal to have <br/>
on hand for friends and newcomers to the group. I'm sure I'll have no <br/>
problem getting rid of a few extras in the coming months. Also, if <br/>
anyone misses the deadline, we can avoid heartbreak. Lastly, having <br/>
extras floating around will avoid the lengthy effort involved in <br/>
amassing another bulk order, at least for a while, anyway.<br/>

Thanks, all!<br/>
