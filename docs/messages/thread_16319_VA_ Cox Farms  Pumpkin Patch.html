into at the pumpkin patch.  I had to leave(to take my youngest to the <br/>
doctors) but I left the other two with the turtle trekkers. I missed <br/>
the actual find, a first find for the happyhomeschoolers, but the <br/>
others found it. (I can't belive that Daughter of the Old Dominion <br/>
didn't beat us to it, seems like she is always first!)  :-)<br/>
<br/>
We had alot of fun at the pumpkin patch, it just isn't Fall without a <br/>
visit to Cox's.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Arielle for the added fun, maybe next year you'll plant <br/>
another one there!<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone ask you for an exchange?<br/>
