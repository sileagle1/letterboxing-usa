<br/>
This event will take place on Sunday, August 21, 2005 beginning at 12 noon<br/>
and lasting until round about 5 p.m. or so. Our past two have been great fun<br/>
and this year should be no different.<br/>
<br/>
There are several permanent boxes on the sanctuary and many more within<br/>
close proximity at nearby parks.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the generous folks at the sanctuary (doing me a favor yet again,<br/>
since I no longer work there), we will be allowed to use the canopies and<br/>
picnic tables in the field adjacent to the nature center and parking lot. (I<br/>
hope folks will consider a small donation to the sanctuary as a way to say<br/>
"thank you" for this courtesy.)<br/>
<br/>
A few items of note:<br/>
The restrooms are in the nature center, which closes at 5 p.m.<br/>
Alas, as always, dogs are not allowed on the sanctuary.<br/>
Smoking and alcohol are also not permitted. (The town of Sharon has a no<br/>
public smoking statute)<br/>
We will have a hitchhiker hostel and will observe strict "bring one to take<br/>
one" rules as well as "no double, triple etc dipping" to prevent the<br/>
over-exploitation of hitchhikers.<br/>
CSCM and I will be hosting and will provide cold drinks and we welcome folks<br/>
to bring their favorite dish.<br/>
<br/>
I will carve an event stamp but certainly welcome any other event stamps or<br/>
traveling event stamps to join us that day.<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments or<br/>
concerns....or if you'd like to RSVP.<br/>
We hope you'll be able to join us on this relatively short notice.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
