out my stamps.  I did a archive search and am having difficulty <br/>
coming up with an authoritative answer.  I CRAVE STRUCTURE!  And want <br/>
to have a true and valid F count.<br/>

How do I count boxes that I replaced for others?<br/>
Are they simply an uncountable charitable act?<br/>
<br/>
2)<br/>
How do I count event stamps? <br/>

How do I count Travellers?<br/>
<br/>

Travellers are an appealing mystery to me.  Are they simply stamps <br/>
that require a specific random act to be revealed and stamped?  Like <br/>
the secret word on the Groucho Marx show?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Everyone seems to have a different way of doing this. Team Rayvenhaus does<br/>
it this way:<br/>
<br/>
1) We count those as [A]dopted, which is where the A comes from in our<br/>
count.<br/>
2) We count those as [E]vent stamps and that's where the E comes from in our<br/>
count<br/>
3) We count those as [T]ravellers and that's where the T comes from in our<br/>
count.<br/>
4) Most Travelers are that we are familiar by, though this in no way means<br/>
that all Travelers are. We've had to meet someone and give them a code<br/>
phrase, we've merely had to be at an event and we've had to find someone at<br/>
an event and give them a code word.  It all depends.<br/>
