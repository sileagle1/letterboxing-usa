We have been playing a great game of phone tag. I work some pretty crazy hours due to the fact that I work in the health care field. I have no specific guide lines set up for this series the stamp can be any size. I will be putting the boxes together, so there is no need for anything but the stamp. I have this great nature preserve in Hesperia where I will be placing all the boxes. I am including a list of all the games that have been spoken for.<br/>

&gt; Jacks's - Jacks (received)<br/>

Are you from Oceana County? What area in Hesperia are you referrring to? Justy curious, as I used to live out near Ferry (and taught school there) and grew up in Hart. I'm related to LOTS of people over there. Anyhow, I would like to do Ghost in the Graveyard for your series. When do you need the stamp by?<br/>
