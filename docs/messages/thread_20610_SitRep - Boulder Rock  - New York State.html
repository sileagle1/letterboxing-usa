<br/>
	We had just got to the  Boulder Rock letterbox and someone (name not<br/>
mentioned) had signed in today! Wow were we surprised . We have never yet<br/>
run into any other letterboxer. This was very close for sure because it<br/>
is right on top of a mountain. We maybe passed them on the<br/>
trail...........Found the box a bit  damp but otherwise ok. Everyone has<br/>
been taking good care of it - Thanks  - Its still sandwiched between two<br/>
rocks and the top rock is nice and squareish so others have accidentally<br/>
found the letterbox and sign in! They left a note that they would<br/>
checkout the letterbox website.<br/>
                Budster stayed home resting but we walk him a lot over by<br/>
the "Bridge to Nowhere" letterbox otherdays<br/>
	Back to work tomorrow and will be thinking of our next letterbox<br/>
adventure<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   Enjoy the outdoors!   J&amp;G<br/>
