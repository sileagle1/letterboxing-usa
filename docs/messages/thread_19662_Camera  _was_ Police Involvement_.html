Yes, I know it has been said here many times before, but for all the <br/>
newer folks...  having a camera with you can be one of the best <br/>
covers while letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Having a camera and giving the appearance that you are scouting a <br/>
location or trying to find "the perfect shot" is a license to look <br/>
under bushes, inside trees or under rocks, it explains why you are <br/>
retracing steps or reading something in your hand (which is in <br/>
actuality a compass, but most people don't look close enough and <br/>
figure it is a light meter).  It explains why you are heading into <br/>
the woods not on a trail or ducking behind a fence or under a <br/>
bridge...  all without questions or suspicion (most of the time).<br/>
<br/>
Carry a camera -- even if you aren't actually into photography, heck <br/>
the camera doesn't even have to work...<br/>
