I've been letterboxing for about 6 months, I geocache much more. Geocaching has a ready source of information, so I know if a box is active or not.

  Well, we do tend to wander around in the boondocks sometimes, but see--BYAFG has pulled us back on topic. Sorta. And some people use Paypal to acquire their letterboxing supplies. It all goes back to the boxes if you wait around long enough. =)<br/>
<br/>
  BTW thanks for your report on the soggy Zenith log, I pulled it &amp; it's dried out. But it has some mildewed spots. So here's a question for the list: would you rather stamp in on the old mildewed-but-with-stamp-images log, or a new one that's pristine but has no history? <br/>
<br/>

  I just joined this list and I can not believe how much effort and energy is going into this thread on Paypal, which has nothing to do with letterboxing. Did I join the wrong list? Also, Please change your subject line. It should reflect the content of your email. <br/>

  support him. :)<br/>

I can not tell you how many new areas just around our area we have learned about from letterboxing.  It also makes vacationing more interesting.

&gt; My family and just started letterboxing the 2nd week in July.  <br/>
We've come across only a few boxes that were missing, or we just got <br/>
too turned around and  not in the right area.  But it is still a <br/>
challenge and the excitement to find the "treasure" as my kids would <br/>
call it.  We get bummed if we can't find a box, but we go to the <br/>
next spot and we feel better then. =)   I think we get more excited <br/>
if we get a bonus, like a HH, or run into fellow boxers than <br/>
anything else. LOL    <br/>

&gt;   Many, if not most letterboxers believe it's about the journey, <br/>
not<br/>
&gt; necessarily the find. If the find is that important to you, you <br/>
might want<br/>
&gt; to email placers and ask them, or only go for boxes that have been <br/>
recently<br/>
&gt; found. And that's OK, do what you need to do. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I personally don't mind the effort if I get a beautiful scene, a <br/>
workout, a<br/>
&gt; new park, or a smile from a child out of it. The stamp is just a <br/>
bonus.<br/>

&gt; As long as the stamp goes in my pretty little journal, I really <br/>
don't worry<br/>
&gt; about the log book. If it's stampable, I stamp it, if not I pass. <br/>
I've only<br/>
&gt; found the one totally unstampable so it doesn't seem to be too big <br/>
problem. <br/>
&gt; I've been letterboxing for about 6 months, I geocache much more. <br/>
Geocaching<br/>
&gt; has a ready source of information, so I know if a box is active or <br/>
not. I've<br/>
&gt; run across lots of missing letterboxes and I'm not sure where to <br/>
find<br/>
&gt; accurate info about their status. This can discouragie me a little <br/>
from<br/>
&gt; letterboxing, all that effort and a missing box is a bummer. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW- I thought Zenith was the cutest little hide spot. <br/>
