<br/>
I suggest looking at who has planted and found boxes nearby. As a registered member on AtlasQuest, you can view the profile of the members that have planted or found boxes nearby, where members have the option to list their location. I don't believe there is a specific search tool to find members based on location.<br/>
<br/>
Another option is to search  for a specific Yahoo group of letterboxers in your area. Searching for "letterboxing Kansas" shows the "LetterboxingMidwest" group. Of course, Midwest is a pretty big chunk of the country.<br/>
<br/>
You could also join a letterboxing event and meet people directly. Atlas Quest lists events and includes an option to search events by location. You'll need to recheck it regularly, as some events are hosted with fairly short notice.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>

Suggest you contact Ryan Carpenter on AQ and create a "board" where kansas<br/>
boxers can blog. thats a good way to find people in your area. Also as you<br/>
mentioned just send an aq email to those who have planted and see what<br/>
happens.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Dorothy took them all off to Oz with her<br/>

Why do we keep refering everyone to AQ? Every other board is dying due to lack of posting.  If I were  a new boxer I would find AQ just too scattered. Too much chatter unrelated to boxing. I think I'll go put on my asbestos underwear.<br/>
