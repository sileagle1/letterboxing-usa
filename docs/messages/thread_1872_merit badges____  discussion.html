  I get the point on the 75 being a little useless.  But I'm thinking from <br/>
the point of view of the kids that are in the sport.  75 would be abig deal <br/>
to them.  By the time they get past the 100 mark, increments of 25 might be <br/>
less important.  Then too, for us in the Midwest, we would have to do some <br/>
major traveling to stamp up at 75!<br/>
<br/>
After this first order the merit badges will be available in batches of 10 <br/>
and can be order by the individual in any combination using the denominations <br/>
we have set up with the embroidery shop.<br/>
<br/>
I'm leaning toward denominations of:  10 ,  25,  50,  75,  100, 150, 200, <br/>
250, 500, 1000 .   Its open for discussion though.   Any comments?<br/>

 &gt;  The denominations will be  10 ,  25,  50,  75,  100,<br/>
 &gt;    Before now, I haven't considered above 100.    What would the Web <br/>
Masters<br/>
 &gt; like to see offered here?  150, 200, 250, etc  or more of a challenge like<br/>
 &gt; 200, 500, 1000 ? :oP<br/>
<br/>
 I don't think its up to the webmasters, but up to the list (or the <br/>
 letterboxer that want these things).  The webmasters aren't interested <br/>
 in setting policy for the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
 I think the question is how many different denominations can be gotten<br/>
 in one run?  I don't know how these things work, but if the limit<br/>
 is 5 denominations per run, I would throw the 75 and/or the 10 overboard <br/>
 and replace it with a 500 and 1000.  The 75 definitely seems useless, <br/>
 IMHO :-)<br/>
<br/>
 It also depends on how frequently one of these orders can be mustered.<br/>
 If it is more than once a year or more, getting 500s at least in the <br/>
 pipeline now makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
 So, if it were me, I'd do 25, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and sort of make<br/>
 that a standard, for now.  But like I said, I really don't understand<br/>
 how these things work.  If we can do 10, 25, 50, (75), 100, 500, 1000<br/>
 now, fine, but I personally would order a 500 if one were possible.<br/>
<br/>
 Cheers,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">How about using binary notation.  Then all we need to order are 1's and<br/>
0's. and you can make any number you want.<br/>
<br/>
But seriously.  Kay, is the price you quoted for one denomination<br/>
or a composite patch containing all of the denominations in which the<br/>
letterboxers would cut themselves?<br/>
