                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm used to the vacant stares and the polite nods of feigned interest when I talk about my 'boxing with co-workers or disinterested friends.  (Well, they  *ask* me what I've done on the weekend.  Maybe it's like a "How are you?" that you really aren't supposed to answer truthfully. <s>) Imagine my surprise when the teacher I work with announced that her daughter went to a "letterboxing birthday party" in Lincoln Woods!  We both live in Warwick, so there are closet boxers around here.  Just wondering, are they reading this list?  Please contact me if you feel like talking 'boxing in these parts.<br/>
