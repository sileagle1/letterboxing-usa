                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ahhhh .... now that makes sense.  A place to notify a box owner that <br/>
their box needs maintenance.  *nods*  :) However, I think that if Wes <br/>
can work it out so that the box owner can be contacted by secure <br/>
email via the clue page, it might eliminate the need for such a place.<br/>
<br/>
As you said - we look out for each others boxes now the best we can - <br/>
but some notification system would be a really helpful solution.  We <br/>
need to remember that not all letterboxers read and subscribe to this <br/>
list.  None of my local friends who letterbox use this list (for <br/>
example).  Also, if someone posted a problem to another "place" that <br/>
might not get checked regularly, either.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the solution might be an easier way to contact the box owner, <br/>
rather than to just post publicly about problem boxes.  *shrug*  <br/>

Obscured clues well you can always go back and try again if you did <br/>
not find it the first time. What got me mad is when I found a box <br/>
with no stamp in it,and I know a fellow letterboxer reported 6 months <br/>
ago and it was not replaced. Maybe the owner of the box did not see <br/>
the posting about their box, that is why I said if we had a list we <br/>
could check it. I myself have 50 boxes out there and i,m starting to <br/>
learn its not easy to check them all the time. I have found boxes <br/>
full of water,cracked boxes,full logbooks and other things.I  just <br/>
thought it would be easier if we had a place to jog them down. I know <br/>
we look out for each others boxes now the best we can, but I thought <br/>
a list would be better. <br/>

We are the owners of the Covered Bridge box.  Yes, Butterfly told us in<br/>
January that the stamp was missing.  Unfortunately, we just have not had the<br/>
time to go out and replace it yet.  So, if anyone else is planning on going<br/>
to find that box, you may want to wait until at least June when we can get<br/>
back and put a new stamp in.<br/>

No prob Lenny.... With the winter we've had, most of the boxes here have had <br/>
water, especially if they were below the snow line (which at times here in CT <br/>
was at 30 inches).  I know that I cherish the e-mails which come on the list <br/>
and to me directly concerning the status of my boxes.  That way, I can keep <br/>
up on them, without checking on them as much, especially if they are reported <br/>
in fine shape.  I have three boxes out of state, two of which I don't get to <br/>
check on at all (Wanda and Pete, and Amanda from Seattle can probably relate <br/>
on this one).  One has been unofficially reported missing, from someone <br/>
looking for the box for the first time.  Since it is in VA, I can not go and <br/>
check on it, and though the Potomac may have taken the box, until someone who <br/>
has previously found the box goes and checks on it for me, I really don't <br/>
know the status.  All I can do is put a post on the clues that it may be <br/>
missing.<br/>
