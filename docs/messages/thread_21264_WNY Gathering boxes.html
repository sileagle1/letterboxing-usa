The majority of the WNY gathering boxes are still down (and <br/>
permanent), although changes have been made in order to return boxes <br/>
to owners. There's about 2 less boxes at Royalton Ravine, but that <br/>
just shortens the trip a little instead of throwing off the whole <br/>
chain of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Also, all but one of the Rotary Park boxes have changed. Even if you <br/>
were there before, the only original box there is Dances With Fire, <br/>
so recheck to be sure. The rest had to be returned to their owners, <br/>
so if you're looking for them to post your finds on AQ, you'll have <br/>
to check under the owner's logbook instead of ours. <br/>
<br/>
The ones posted now are PERMANENT (albeit under a foot of snow), so <br/>
check here for the clues (this link is a direct one to the Rotary <br/>
Park ones, but scroll up for the Royalton Ravine ones): <br/>
