Turns out, they made some substantial changes in the new setup which wiped out my custom changes in the configuration file for the web server--which was automatically redirecting old and otherwise broken links to their new locations.<br/>
<br/>
Testing it all on AQ, I didn't notice the problem since all the code on AQ points to the correct locations to begin with. All the old links off of AQ that still point to the wrong location, though--those basically got hosed.<br/>
<br/>
Wasn't until Jay told me about all the broken links that I realized there was a problem. I added back all the redirects, which should fix the problem. Sorry about that, though. Completely accidental!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Choi, when you have time, think you can update any old links on LbNA to point to the new (and correct) location so next time something like this happens, all the links don't seem to break at once? One or two quick database queries should get all the links corrected.<br/>

Guess Silent Doug's clue was getting a lot of action this weekend.... =)<br/>
