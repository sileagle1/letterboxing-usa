It hasn't beat 2.5 years yet, but I've got a hunch pigs will fly <br/>
before some of the boxes I've placed in Africa and Central America <br/>
are found!<br/>

Mapsurfer #2 was placed 7-Feb-99.  As of 12-Jan-03, no one had yet logged<br/>
a visit.  I doubt anyone has visited since then, but who knows.  So that's<br/>
about 4 years give or take.  I haven't been following the thread too closely,<br/>
so I dunno if that is the longest.  I expect it to fall this spring, tho, <br/>
leaving mapsurfer #3 (placed 13-Mar-99), which has also been out there <br/>
over 4 years, as another long term virgin.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
