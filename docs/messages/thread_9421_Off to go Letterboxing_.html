                    <html><body>Well.... since I am a school teacher, and hate to go to the mall on the Friday after Thanksgiving, I'm going to go letterboxing today!  I'm hoping to find the My Favorite Musicals series in Mansfield, plus a couple of others before I have to come home and work on my presentation for Monday.
<br/>
<br/>This is my first time letterboxing in snow.... I'm guessing that it makes it all the more difficult.  So wish me luck!  BTW..... I'm going alone, so if there are any letterboxers that haven't done the musicals yet, make sure you see me check into each box ok???
