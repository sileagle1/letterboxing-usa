<br/>
I know this is different depending on who is writing the clues, but <br/>
*in general*, *on average*, do most of you consider a pace as 1 <br/>
footfall?  And is a footfall just the length of a foot (like placing <br/>
your feet end-to-end for the specified number of "paces"), or the <br/>
length of the step taken (between the feet)?  Am I making any sense?  <br/>
LOL<br/>

 some days our steps can really be different. We each count off and if<br/>
writing clues, use both or just say appx. 33 steps or whatever. If<br/>
looking for a box we hope for the best, sometimes we can be off by 10<br/>
steps but still find it.  I've read where a "pace" counts as 2 steps<br/>
which can be really confusing!<br/>

&gt; HI <br/>
Traditionally a pace is the distances at the end of a double stride were both feet have touched the ground. The average length is about 5 feet. Most people today have shortened it out to one stride for easy counting.  After letterboxing for a while, I have found out that both methods are used on a regular bases. That is why when I post a letterbox it will be distance in feet.   I figure no two people have the same stride, so knowing my own and converting it to feet makes the most sense. <br/>
