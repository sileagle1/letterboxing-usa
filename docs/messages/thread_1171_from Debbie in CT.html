&lt;&lt; Hi,	<br/>
 	I have lots of exciting news. First of all we found the <br/>
traveling box car letterbox. we haven't decided where to hide it <br/>
next, but I'll let you know.<br/>
 	Second we are having a problem with the Ibna web stie. I <br/>
can't acess pages in Franklin, Colchester, Exter, Middletown, <br/>
Ledyard, or the Arboretum Adventure of the Bear cave. Do you have any <br/>
suggestions or know these pages have gone. <br/>
 	We also have a couple of letter boxes that we think are <br/>
missing do you know where to report them?<br/>
 	We love letter boxing so much that my mom had patches made <br/>
for our finding 25 letterboxes. We also would like to organize some <br/>
kind of get together for letterboxers. We could use one of the state <br/>
parks and plant an annual box at the get together. We also thought it <br/>
would be great to have a patch made up (of the annual stamp.) What do <br/>
you think. I know I would love to meet some of the letterboxeers <br/>
whose stamps we've come to recognize.<br/>
 	Please e-mail me back.<br/>
 					Thanks,<br/>
 						Debbie<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;<debbie, <br="" any="" awesome!="" haven't="" i="" noticed="" problem="" that's="" the="" with="">
website, but I do think you may have missed the change: it got moved! <br/>
Try<br/>
<br/>
www.letterboxing.org<br/>
<br/>
and see if that doesn't fix the problem. I think the best place to <br/>
tell people about missing letterboxes is on the "talk list," at <br/>
<br/>
http://www.egroups.com/messages/letterbox-usa<br/>
<br/>
lots of people will get the word that way and it'll also put you in <br/>
touch with others. If you don't mind, I'll forward your note to the <br/>
list. I'm sure people will be really psyched about both the patches <br/>
(something we've been wanting for a long time ourselves) and about <br/>
having a get-together. The folks we've met doing letterboxing have <br/>
been just great!<br/>

Just joined the leterbox list and am basically just reading to get a feel<br/>
for the whole thing.<br/>
Thought you all might be interested in knowing that I am going to live and<br/>
work in Shanghai, China for about a year starting this month.  If I can, I<br/>
will try to plant a letter box there.  I should be able to keep in touch by<br/>
email, so I will keep everyone posted.<br/>
Skip, in CT.<br/>
