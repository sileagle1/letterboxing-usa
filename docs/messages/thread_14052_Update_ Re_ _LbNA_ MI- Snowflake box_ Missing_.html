&gt; Hello Michigan boxers-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have any of you visited the Snowflake box in Brighton recently?  My husband <br/>
&gt; and I went in May and couldn't find it.  I tried contacting the placer, but <br/>
&gt; never got a response.  Any ideas if this one is MIA?  Or am I just a dolt, <br/>
&gt; missed it, and should go back and look with my eyes open this time?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>

Anyway, it was definitely not in the same spot where I located it last year.<br/>

Thanks for checking!  Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm completely off the mark or if it's actually gone.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you find more carving medium soon!  Everytime my husband goes for some I shoot him the evil eye-that stuff's hard to find!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
