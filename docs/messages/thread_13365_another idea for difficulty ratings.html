                    <div class="plaintext-content">Geocaching.com has a rating system where planters can rate their caches on <br/>
a 1 to 5 scale for both terrain and the overall difficulty. This gives you <br/>
some insight before you decide to go off searching for a cache, so you <br/>
don't get in over your head or run out of time before dusk falls, etc. They <br/>
link to a tool that creates the ratings for you based on your answers to a <br/>
few questions. By codifying the ratings, you can avoid the problems that <br/>
arise from different interpretations of what might be an "easy" or <br/>
"difficult" hike. Users can also search for caches based on those levels, <br/>
which is a nice feature. For instance, a 1/1 geocache is almost always <br/>
wheelchair accessible, so searching is a quick way for those on wheels to <br/>
find suitable caches.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote to the creator of the tool and asked to adapt the code for <br/>
letterboxing, and put together a working version on my site here:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/rating/<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to give it a test with some of the boxes that you've <br/>
planted and see if the results seem to fit your expectations. Some of the <br/>
language is still very geocache-centric and should probably be changed, but <br/>
I welcome any input. (If you get a "500 error" when testing it, just hit <br/>
the refresh button in your browser -- my web host seems a bit flakey lately.)<br/>

I think that using the tool as a guideline for ratings would work well as long as people don't get the idea that the tool is the ultimate rule and should be used as a guideline to be moderated with common sense.<br/>

Thank you creating this tool - I think it is helpful as it provides <br/>
some standard concerns to think about. I especially liked the <br/>
measurements, such as elevation being one I could ride my bike up. I <br/>
guess that is still subjective - some folks can certainly manage <br/>
hills I can't, but if one tries to think of the average person, it <br/>
works.<br/>
I tried out 2 of my plants. The first rated the terrain more <br/>
difficult than I would. <br/>
1) The Cavorting Cavy box (Norfolk MA) - the tool rating gave me DR <br/>
of 2 and a TR of 3.  In actuality this is an easy walk. I am not in <br/>
shape (sigh) not very sure-footed but I was never out of breath and <br/>
walked it with ease. Should be fine for the casual hiker and school <br/>
age children.<br/>
However, the trail is only one person wide so it would not be <br/>
suitable for strollers and I would probably not have enjoyed this <br/>
walk with a toddler as there isn't room to walk holding their hand.<br/>
The rating description said: "some overgrowth, some steep elevation <br/>
changes, or more than a 2 mile hike."<br/>
<br/>
I think that would scare off people who could easily do this hike. <br/>
Just my opinion<br/>
<br/>
Maybe suitability for small children should be separate <br/>
consideration?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2). The Rocky Woods Series, (Norfolk, MA) This gave me a 3.25. The <br/>
same description was given:"Not suitable for small children. (The <br/>
average adult or older child should be OK depending on physical <br/>
condition. Terrain is likely off-trail. May have one or more of the <br/>
following: some overgrowth, some steep elevation changes, or more <br/>
than a 2 mile hike.)"<br/>
Pretty accurate.<br/>
<br/>
One additional suggestion - I would prefer to have mileage broken <br/>
down a little more. That 2-10 rage is a little broad, for me. I <br/>
would do a 5 mile hike but not a 10. Then again, I usually try to <br/>
get a trail map and make my own assessmemnt of whether its okay for <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Cavy Lovers<br/>
