just bringing this message back to the top so folks new to the board <br/>
will know about the event and to remind the seasoned letterboxers <br/>
that it's coming up quickly.  Hope to see you all there!!!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Ryan from Portland has graciously offered to carve the event stamp!  <br/>
Many applause in advance for your efforts.  If you plan on placing <br/>
boxes in the park, please do so prior to the event and either post <br/>
your clues to the LBNA site a few days prior or bring several copies <br/>
of clues with you to the event to disseminate to the participants.  <br/>
We have around 20 folks who have already said they were <br/>
attending!!!  The more the merrier!!!<br/>
<br/>
See you soon!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Just a reminder for all of you Pacific NW letterboxers out there...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don't forget to clear your calendar for the upcoming: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1st Annual South Sound Letterbox Quest Fest!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When:  Saturday, 2 Nov 02<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Time:  10am--until COB that is, when you've found the boxes you <br/>
want <br/>
&gt; and you've exchanged the personal stamps that you want!!!  Formal <br/>
&gt; festivities will kick off at 12pm noon!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Location:  Model Boating Picnic Table by the lake at<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ft Steilacoom Park, Lakewood, WA (just south of Tacoma)<br/>
&gt; http://www.ci.lakewood.wa.us/parks.html<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Directions:  From I-5 North &amp; South:  To get to Fort Steilacoom <br/>
Park <br/>
&gt; from Interstate 5, take Exit 125 toward Lakewood. Turn left on <br/>
&gt; Steilacoom Boulevard. The fort is located near the entrance to <br/>
&gt; Western State Hospital at 9601 Steilacoom Blvd. S.W.  Fort <br/>
&gt; Steilacoom Park is directly across the street from the fort.  Turn <br/>
&gt; left on 87th Ave SW,  right on Dresden Lane SW.  Follow the road <br/>
&gt; past the sports fields.  You will eventually see some old, red <br/>
barns <br/>
&gt; in front of and to your right.  Look for the parking lot behind (&amp; <br/>
&gt; left of) Barn #2. <br/>
&gt; Maps &amp; other Directions:  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; LETTERBOXES:  We'll need help from all you South Sound folks in <br/>
&gt; planting additional boxes in the park prior to the event.  Please <br/>
&gt; bring your clues for the new letterboxes to the event with you (10 <br/>
&gt; copies would be great to hand out to the other letterboxes that <br/>
show <br/>
&gt; up that day).  Otherwise, you may post your clues to the message <br/>
&gt; board a few days prior to that.  Don't forget---Hitchhiker LBs are <br/>
&gt; more than welcome, too!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Event Stamp?  Would any artful types like to donate their talents <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; creating an event stamp?  I would, but you wouldn't like my stamp--<br/>
&gt; let's say 'poorly carved' would only be a compliment for what I <br/>
&gt; could create!  ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Food:  No Frills Potluck.  We will eat between 10am and 12pm <br/>
noon.  <br/>
&gt; Please ensure that you bring enough food and <br/>
plates/utensils/drinks, <br/>
&gt; etc. to cover the number of folks within your group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Restrooms:  available at the park.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Am I forgetting anything?  Please let me know if you see any <br/>
glaring <br/>
&gt; oversights!!!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; THEMES FOR POSSIBLE BOXES AT THIS PARK:  Ft Steilacoom Park is a <br/>
&gt; 270+ acre park that already has 2 letterboxes within its <br/>
&gt; boundaries.  These 2 LBs depict the Insane Asylum and Heath Farm <br/>
&gt; that once stood on the grounds.  There are several athletic <br/>
fields, <br/>
&gt; playground, barns with silo, cemetery, historical markers, lake, <br/>
old <br/>
&gt; decrepit buildings and storage structures, walking trails, large <br/>
&gt; trees, berry brambles, Fort Steilacoom <br/>
&gt; http://home1.gte.net/5white/fort_history.html and Western WA State <br/>
&gt; Hospital are directly across the street.  There is a lot of VERY <br/>
&gt; INTERESTING history associated with the area including <br/>
&gt; outlaw/vigilante altercations/hangings, shootouts, the 1st <br/>
&gt; Historical Highway (Byrn Mill Road) in the state ran through the <br/>
&gt; area, you name it.  Pierce County College's campus borders one <br/>
side <br/>
&gt; of the park, too.  On clear days there are views of Mt Rainier.  <br/>
&gt; There are model boating competitions in the lake, running/bike <br/>
races <br/>
&gt; in the park, etc.  Chambers Creek flows from this area and drains <br/>
&gt; into the Puget Sound about 2 miles from here. You are only limited <br/>
&gt; by your imagination!!! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; HOPE TO SEE YOU ALL THEN &amp; BRING YOUR FRIENDS!!!!!<br/>

I just got word from my unit that I don't have to work on the 2nd of <br/>
November!!!!  Yeah, otherwise, I thought my serious case of <br/>
letterboxing fever was going to kick in immediately and I just <br/>
wouldn't be able to regain my health in time to make it to work that <br/>
day!  I'll see you all on the letterboxing trail on the 2nd of <br/>
November!!!<br/>
