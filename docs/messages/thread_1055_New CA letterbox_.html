                    <div class="plaintext-content">Davis, Ca is located at the junction of Highways 80 and 113, about 15 <br/>
minutes from Sacramento. It is an interesting little college town of <br/>
54,000. Most famous for the world-class University of California-<br/>
Davis, there are other attractions such as the infamous "Toad <br/>
Tunnel", a lively downtown, and over 640 miles of bike trails within <br/>
the city limits.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are the clues for the first Letterbox at the University of <br/>
California-Davis, placed July 9, 2000.<br/>
Only look for this Letterbox during the middle part of the day when <br/>
the university is open.<br/>
Warning: there is about 2 miles of walking, including lots of stairs, <br/>
so be prepared to spend some time here on our beautiful campus.  <br/>
The optimal place to start is the parking garage by the North Gate <br/>
entry off of Russell Blvd.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Through the MU, the book store you'll go by,<br/>
On your way to 1100 Social Sci.<br/>
Down the reverse pyramid to the right (don't fall) <br/>
Stay in between cement columns and glass wall.<br/>
By the second square planter, go up 24<br/>
Follow the path to the left if you're ready for more.<br/>
To your port side, you shall go,<br/>
Climb 24 more, take your time, go slow.<br/>
Past the elevator to the right,<br/>
Into the dark (it's only one flight)<br/>
Coming out of the shadows, to your left, there's a patio<br/>
Down one more series of steps you shall go<br/>
At the diagonal corner, there's a 26 net,<br/>
To go right down a street is your best bet.<br/>
Travel the path that shines luminous at night, <br/>
All who enter this gate are assumed to be bright.<br/>
Around the ovum who stares at the sky,<br/>
And ahead to the pond that floats way up high.<br/>
Head West to the road, if you like,<br/>
Then aim for the circle (watch out for a bike!)<br/>
Like the Drifters, go Under the Board Walk<br/>
Past the two students frozen in talk.<br/>
The one with no Eyes is looking your way, <br/>
Head through the arch to the trees if you may.<br/>
If you're correct up to here, you should see a lake,<br/>
Follow it the opposite direction a clock would take. <br/>
Stop when you're introduced to a man (Spafford is his name)<br/>
Head up the hill behind you to continue this little game. <br/>
Have a seat with Lola Riolo,<br/>
Mr. H. Dumpty fell on his head! Oh No!<br/>
In the distance you can see another oval of white,<br/>
Travel to it and into the building on your right.<br/>
<br/>
Straight up the stares, if you dare,<br/>
Left 20 more, through the double door,<br/>
Through the starboard doorway, your trek is about to pay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*At your first black tile in 3 sets of 3, go left.<br/>
Follow that line of tiles all the way to the wall. <br/>
Go 2 tiles to the right, raise the roof (there are plenty of chairs <br/>
around)*<br/>
<br/>
Be discreet! <br/>
