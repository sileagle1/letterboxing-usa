&gt;<br/>
&gt;I recently stopped in Rye, NH and found the 3 letterboxes there. All<br/>
&gt;3 are doing well, with frequent visitors. Had a great time!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yesterday I went to find the Fairies of Borderland. What great clues<br/>
&gt;and hike! Serenity has had a lot of visitors; Love and Peace have had<br/>
&gt;a few.  I was unsuccessful in finding Hope and Joy. I thought I was<br/>
&gt;at the right spots but found nothing. Has anyone found them lately?<br/>
&gt;Still, I was happy to find serenity, love and peace. Thanks for a<br/>
&gt;nice day!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Since nearly everyone on this group is a hiker or a "visitor to<br/>
&gt;National Parks" I had to recommend a Mystery Series by Nevada Barr.<br/>
&gt;All of her books are set in National Parks. The latest, Blood Lure,<br/>
&gt;is in the Waterton/Glacier National Peace Park straddling the border<br/>
&gt;of Montana and Canada. (and concerns Bears!  recently a hot topic<br/>
&gt;here) One of my favorites is Deep South, set in the Natchez Trace<br/>
&gt;Parkway. Her descriptions of the heat and humidity of the south are<br/>
&gt;dead on (no pun intended). The protagonist is a park ranger.  So far,<br/>
&gt;they have never come upon any letterboxes in any of her books!!<br/>

&gt;If the Moorland Wizard is out there " listening" could he give us an<br/>
&gt;idea of how many boxes are in England. I had heard 10,000 in<br/>
&gt;Dartmoor?  Our 4-H Club the Cock-A-Doodle-Moo  is doing an<br/>

&gt;like Ct. 286. We got our other figures off the LBNA site for clues .<br/>
&gt;The title of the exhibit is " Where in the World Are You<br/>

&gt;Fair. It is a great promotional tool.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also did anyone catch a post on Africa boxes I need to search further<br/>

&gt;Subject: Re: counting England boxes<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi "Leader of the Pack" !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;If the Moorland Wizard is out there " listening"<br/>
&gt;Oh yes I always have my ears on <g> especially for LbNA !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;could he give us an idea of how many boxes are in England. I had heard<br/>
&gt;&gt;10,000 in<br/>
&gt;&gt;Dartmoor?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well that is a tricky one actually !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tony Moore has issued over 30,000 boxes in his latest edition of the<br/>
&gt;Catalogue of Dartmoor Letterboxes.  This is reprinted and updated twice a<br/>
&gt;year with bi-monthly mailed updates..we don't have a web-based catalogue<br/>
&gt;you see..we are still in the pen and ink stage <grin><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;HOWEVER !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I receive in the mail (not email !) between twenty and forty new boxes<br/>
&gt;every week from my WOM boxing friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;WOM ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh that's "Word of Mouth" boxes...a private circulation system for<br/>
&gt;particularly seriously infected boxers !  <g> You know, those with an<br/>
&gt;acute attack of the incurable boxing bug !  <lol><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They are boxes that are NOT in Tony's catalogue....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Perhaps that's half as many again !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BUT that's not all !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are boxes in other places in England too (but we keep even more<br/>
&gt;quiet about those !!!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is a delightful forest known as "The New Forest" which has its own<br/>
&gt;system (also not in Tony's catalogue)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And then there are other British National Parks in which boxes can be<br/>
&gt;found....We don't put them in our cities like LbNA folk ! (Again NOT in<br/>
&gt;Tony's catalogue)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tony also has a separate catalogue for "Moving Boxes" which you in LbNA<br/>
&gt;land call Hitchikers ..and another catalogue for "Travelling Boxes"..which<br/>
&gt;are a second kind of personal stamp which we Dartmoorians also use !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So remind me , "What was your question ?", How many in England !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ahh well that could be very high indeed....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Certainly a lot more than 10,000 !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Many many UK boxers have the 5,000 patch on their (boxing) jackets !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It's all very very old and established over here..and we like to go for a<br/>
&gt;day's hike and collect 20 or 30, or more, whilst it seems that in the US<br/>
&gt;the numbers are much lower ...It is just that we are a much smaller place<br/>
&gt;and have been doing it longer.  Dartmoor is only about 370 square miles !<br/>
&gt;But is is 'busy' with boxes...some days you just seem to fall over em !<br/>
&gt;<lol><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Finally we do remove and delete and time manage our boxes.  Some are "out"<br/>
&gt;for a day, or a month, or typically a few years..then we "pull them in".<br/>
&gt;As good citizens we don't litter the moor or allow any one box to build a<br/>
&gt;path to itself !!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So I guess I don't really know ..you could think about the boxers count...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I knew one boxer who claimed he had "managed" 1000 of his own .. but<br/>
&gt;allowing for "drift" <g> I guess many of my friends have about 150-200 or<br/>
&gt;so on the moor at any one time !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Most keen boxers will "manage" 30-50 easily....look at the Drews as an<br/>
&gt;example, or Randy ..these folk manage a goodly numbers each !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So I would guess that 20,000 or 25,000 could be on Dartmoor and as many<br/>
&gt;elsewhere all over Britain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That's 40,000 to 50,000 !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That's not counting Travellers and Moving Boxes and other curiosities<br/>
&gt;which maybe are only about 5,000 more (maximum?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The final guess must be ....conservatively ............say 50,000 boxes at<br/>
&gt;any one time !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Our 4-H Club the Cock-A-Doodle-Moo  is doing an<br/>
&gt;&gt;educational display with a world map  showing where the  boxes are<br/>
&gt;&gt;like Ct. 286. We got our other figures off the LBNA site for clues .<br/>
&gt;&gt;The title of the exhibit is " Where in the World Are You<br/>
&gt;&gt;Letterboxing". We may take it to the Big E the new England State<br/>
&gt;&gt;Fair. It is a great promotional tool.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That sound wonderful ...I wish you every success...Do post some pictures<br/>
&gt;to LbNA it will be appreciated !<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also did anyone catch a post on Africa boxes I need to search further<br/>
&gt;&gt;but would be greeat if someone could help count out of states boxes!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know there are boxes in France and Denmark and Germany !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have lists for these countries !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know of at least one each in New Zealand, China , Australia  and<br/>
&gt;Japan...one is in the New Disney Seas Resort (Tokyo) which opens on Sept<br/>
&gt;4th...!  I planted the last three places myself !  For Tokyo you don't<br/>
&gt;have to take any E ride but maybe [Clue] " Seek out a beautiful coast and<br/>
&gt;ring the bell; Ask and it shall be given. "<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have even planted boxes in Africa (One at the Southernmost point in<br/>
&gt;Africa is my most popular box in Africa. I get emails about once a month<br/>
&gt;from new finders !) and Now I have planted boxes in Russia !!!  Only three<br/>
&gt;there so far !  (You have to be very brave to hunt them ! <lol>)  All in<br/>
&gt;Moscow !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That's about all I can locate !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope that helps !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Happy Boxing<br/>

&gt;deal with all the deletions.  At the current message-rate, that must<br/>
&gt;be a problem.  If I saw that option when I joined before, I didn't<br/>
&gt;remember it.<br/>
&gt;    But I visit the list daily - wouldn't miss it - and read many of<br/>
&gt;the posts, after scanning the list for subject matter of special<br/>
&gt;interest or familiar or especially knowledgable members.  Felt funny<br/>
&gt;about not being a member, when I'm so much involved with the<br/>
&gt;activity. But now, following John's reminder, I've happily rejoined<br/>
&gt;the 'family'.<br/>
&gt;    Seems to me that, with the web-site so readily accessed, there is<br/>
&gt;really little need for anyone to receive all the messages.<br/>

&gt;Sorry if your virus checkers did not pick up on it Mine did'nt until<br/>
&gt;it was too late.<br/>

&gt;Hey Graham!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You said you know of at least one letterbox in New Zealand, eh?  Is it<br/>
&gt;on the North or the South Island?  How may I obtain clues for said<br/>
&gt;box(es).  A couple of other letterboxes here in Oregon are going to New<br/>
&gt;Zealand in October and John and I plan to  visit the South Island in<br/>
&gt;December.  If you can point us in the correct direction for clues I'd be<br/>
&gt;most appreciative!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Best regards,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just found out about letterboxing through Walking.about.com<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I'm in Charleston, WV and wonder if there is anyone close by?  I'd be<br/>
&gt;interested in starting or joining a local group.<br/>

&gt;Subject: Oak Harbor, WA Deception Pass Letterbox<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello!  here is a new letterbox in Washington State!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Deception Pass Letterbox<br/>
&gt;Oak Harbor, WA<br/>
&gt;Planted 8/3/01<br/>
&gt;By Amanda from Seattle<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Deception Pass State Park is located 9 miles north of Oak Harbor<br/>
&gt;on SR 20.  The Deception Pass Bridge offers spectacular views.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Enter the park from the Southern entrance.  Go to the North Beach<br/>
&gt;area.  From the Parking area, to the right of the restrooms is a<br/>
&gt;stone cairn marking a trailhead.  Go north down this trail to a<br/>
&gt;picnic shelter.  Continue northwest to the Beach for views of the<br/>
&gt;Bridge. (the Bridge was built in 1935 and is 182 feet high)  At the<br/>
&gt;farthest North concrete firepit and picnic benches, go back toward<br/>
&gt;the woods, take the trail at 60 degrees.  15 steps up the trail and<br/>
&gt;there will be a large boulder on your right.  (approx. 8 ft. tall)<br/>
&gt;Behind and under this boulder is the letterbox.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank god I use Unix, which is why I was able to catch this one.  This<br/>
&gt;brings up a legitimate point, I am a little concerned that some of the<br/>
&gt;clues are written in MS word files.  I usually never open attachments, and<br/>
&gt;the one's I do receive by email I first open up in a text editor (Notepad,<br/>
&gt;vi, whatever) before I launch them in Office.  In general I would like to<br/>
&gt;encourage people to learn HTML, it is actually quite easy considering that<br/>
&gt;there are tons of available software which does the code for you<br/>
&gt;(Especially if the clues are just graphics and text.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Remember that not everyone owns MS Office (even though Microsoft would<br/>
&gt;want everyone to own two copies.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Viruses passing through network drives is another issue....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, just as an aside, there is free Virus Scanning software available<br/>
&gt;which runs directly through a website (housecall.antivirus.com) It will<br/>
&gt;clean but not protect, but the nice part is that is always up to date.<br/>

&gt;Hi John I saw where you said you could stop the e-mail by changing one's<br/>
&gt;settings to read on the web only, where are the settings to change? or<br/>
&gt;if I "unsubscribe" does that mean I cannot post? Thanks for your help .<br/>

&gt;I think you're gonna need A LOT of pins for your map!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let us know if you do exhibit at the Big E (Eastern States<br/>
&gt;Exposition). I'll be sure to look for you!<br/>

&gt;Oh, BTW, I found your Ready Freddy hitchhiker. It's been all over CT<br/>
