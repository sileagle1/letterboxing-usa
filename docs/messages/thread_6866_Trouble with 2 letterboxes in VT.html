I read a posting (can't remember if it was to me or to the list) that both<br/>
of these boxes had been recently found (within the past three weeks).<br/>
<br/>
So ... if you have the chance and inclination ..persevere. I do think Maine<br/>
Junction is easy, though it does have a twist to it.<br/>

&gt; A friend and I just got back from searching for 2 letterboxes in<br/>
&gt; Killington, VT. One is the 'Maine Junction' Letterbox and the other<br/>

&gt; lead us to what seemed like the right spot, but we found nothing.<br/>

&gt; and they other Heading taken from about 1/2 mile away sends<br/>
