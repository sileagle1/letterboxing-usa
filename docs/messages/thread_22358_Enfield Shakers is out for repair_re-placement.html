"officially" put it "out for repairs".  <br/>
<br/>
I recently got an email from someone who received help finding the box by  <br/>
the local police.  They knew exactly where it was, but recommended that she  <br/>
contact us to move the box since it was on State property.<br/>
<br/>
It was in a precarious spot - right near the prison, a busy road and  the <br/>
Lego warehouse.  But it was in the foundation of an old Shaker house -  the <br/>
perfect spot for this box!!<br/>
<br/>
Tom and I will be looking around for a new spot.<br/>
