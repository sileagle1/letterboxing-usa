I do:<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is such a BIG hobby of mine, nary a school day goes by in which<br/>
I mention letterboxing in class or the students ask me about my latest<br/>
exploits (and not just to distract me from teaching the lesson).  I'm hoping<br/>
to put up a big bulletin board in my classroom about letterboxing and my<br/>
travels soon.  The principal has asked me to put together a letterboxing<br/>
activity for the staff to do as a fun team-building activity.  In addition<br/>
to my math classes, I have made letterboxes for the German and Spanish<br/>
students (coming soon!) and for our Creative Writing class.  I hope to make<br/>
a box for each discipline in our school.  I am also working with our Art<br/>
Club to place a number of stamps they'll (hopefully) make this spring.  I've<br/>
even had an inquiry about making a box for summer band camp.  I also hope to<br/>
present letterboxing to our Lutheran Pioneers (our version of Boy/Girl<br/>
Scouts) in our Lutheran grade schools, and/or for family nights.<br/>
<br/>
My first letterbox was placed on our school grounds to celebrate our outdoor<br/>
classroom and our environmental trails.  I also use temporary letterboxes<br/>
for my distance runners to find during a fun practice.  One of my cross<br/>
country families should begin letterboxing as soon as the snow clears.<br/>
<br/>
As far as for my classes:<br/>
<br/>
In my Honors Algebra class (Freshmen), I created a letterbox (Mathman 1) for<br/>
them because they asked for one!  They felt slighted since I had boxes for<br/>
all of my other classes (as you'll see) and really wanted one to do.  I had<br/>
held off making one for them since they could not drive, and hiding a box on<br/>
campus is too easy (and too easy to cheat).  At their insistence, I told<br/>
them I'd make one for them, but it would have to be done as a "family<br/>
outing" since their parents or siblings would have to drive.  They agreed.<br/>
Mathman 1 forced them to review the mathematics they learned over the second<br/>
semester of Algebra.  The beauty of the project is that it was easy to<br/>
correct.  They had the clue sheet of math clues to complete, the box stamps<br/>
to stamp on the sheet, and to prove they were at the box, I placed a<br/>
disposable camera in the box for them to take their picture at the box.  I<br/>
displayed the pictures in my classroom this year, and they were a big<br/>
conversation piece for a number of weeks.  A number of parents contacted me<br/>
to tell me it was the best assignment (even though it is extra credit) their<br/>
kids ever had!  (Unfortunately, to my knowledge none of them became actual<br/>
letterboxers :( )<br/>
<br/>
This year's Honors Algebra class didn't want to wait until May to do a box.<br/>
They wanted one for first semester review to do during Christmas break.<br/>
Thus, since the Mathman 4 box was available for placing, I converted it for<br/>
them.  Again, a big success, and families has lots of fun - even in the cold<br/>
and snow!<br/>
<br/>
In my Honors Advanced Algebra class (Sophomores and Juniors), their second<br/>
semester project is to create a Mathman letterbox. They will be reviewing<br/>
the current Mathman boxes and trying a few.  They will be reading letterbox<br/>
clues on the internet for ideas.  They will get their butts outside, away<br/>
from the computer and TV (how'd that soapbox get in here?), and find a<br/>
hiding spot in nature, and will write clues that force them to use the<br/>
mathematics they learned this year, and also to convey their knowledge of<br/>
mathematics verbally.  If they want to carve a stamp, I give them the<br/>
materials, otherwise I carve the design they pick.  I also supply all the<br/>
baggies, boxes, notebooks, etc.  They are graded mostly on their creative<br/>
use of mathematics in the clues and on the accuracy and clarity of their<br/>
mathematical clues.  Last year was the first year I tried this.  I gave<br/>
extra credit for it last year since I wanted to see if it would work as an<br/>
assignment and to work out the bugs for this year.  The result was Mathman<br/>
2, 3, and 5  (the group that had #4 never finished until I finished it for<br/>
them).  In my humble opinion, Mathman 2 is one of the better letterboxes in<br/>
Wisconsin - if you can get past the matrix mathematics involved.  The<br/>
students did a great job on that one, and it will be the main model for the<br/>
future ones.<br/>
<br/>
In my PreCalc and Trigonometry classes (Juniors and Seniors), the students<br/>
must find the three Triangles Triangles Everywhere boxes using the<br/>
trigonometry they learned.  In addition to completing the worksheet of clues<br/>
(created just for them - letterboxers have different clues), they must make<br/>
a posterboard, videotape, or webpage of their trip.  I change the locations<br/>
of the boxes when they are done, so they can't tell next year's class where<br/>
they are (and in case a student takes both classes.  This also prevents them<br/>
from easily vandalizing them afterwards.)  By the time spring fever hits and<br/>
senioritis rages, this letterbox series forces them to get out and enjoy the<br/>
weather, while completing a worthwhile educational activity.  I promote it<br/>
as a chance for them to go on a "road trip" in the nice weather, and warn<br/>
them not to leave it to the last minute or plan too few free days that they<br/>
are forced to do it during bad weather.  Those that plan well, and do it on<br/>
a nice day have a lot of fun.  Those that leave it to the last minute or on<br/>
a rotten day see it as a horrible chore.  With prodding, I get these<br/>
students to admit they had fun if they put aside the weather and the haste.<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, our school has a set of compasses I can loan to the students.  For<br/>
their personal stamps, I tell them to find a stamp around home or to use<br/>
their thumbprint.  They actually have fun finding their own stamp!)<br/>
<br/>
As far as vandalism and "letting too many people know about letterboxing", I<br/>
think I'm very blessed.  I'm blessed to have mostly honor students (and<br/>
Christians to boot) that tend to respect the letterboxing community.  (Our<br/>
students are also taught to respect God's nature (also part of the<br/>
letterboxing code of conduct) and other people's property).  Other than some<br/>
disparaging remarks in the logbooks (from the bad weather and hastily done<br/>
students), I've had no vandalism and plenty of great comments on the<br/>
activities.  Also, there are not enough letterboxers in Wisconsin to begin<br/>
with, so I surely hope these activities bring more people to letterboxing.<br/>
So far none of the students or their families (other than the CC family)<br/>
have picked up the hobby - unfortunately.  But I press on, because I think<br/>
the students and parents I serve are prime candidates for letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I invite other teachers (et al) to contact me with any additional questions<br/>
they have, for more info, copies of my projects, etc.<br/>
