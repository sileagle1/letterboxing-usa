                    <html><body>What I like, try to incorporate in my boxes, and appreciate in others is a hike that's not too difficult but has a reward other than the letterbox ........ beautiful view, lake, stream, waterfall, or the like.  Sometimes it's nice to go to an historic spot than I otherwise wouldn't know about ....... some of the NJ mystery boxes are great for that.
<br/>
<br/>Although the hunt is the thing, it's not the only thing.  It's great to discover a new 'favorite hiking spot' by way of letterboxing.

For the inside I love how others interpreted  their surroundings or story<br/>
onto the image on the stamp.<br/>
I love to look through the other stamps of people who have been there before<br/>
me. It is almost like you get to know others before you even meet them.<br/>
For the hiking side of it my favorite boxes are the ones that have an<br/>
interesting story or tidbit or a piece of history with it. I love that!!! I<br/>
love a stumbling onto a gorgeous view as well. You know what this is such an<br/>
additive hobby  that I doubt you could plant a boring box. I think we all<br/>
agree we just love the hobby so much that .... well lets just say I have<br/>
never found one I that I really didn't like.<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Hi Roxanne,
</p><p>I'm fairly new at this too but to me an exciting box is one that is placed somewhere I haven't visited, that he clues are clever and the stamp is hand-carved and unique. I haven't found many and I'm working on a spot to place one, but the ones that I have found were in new and different places- not my usual haunts, and the hunt was well written and clever. I haven't figured out how to use my compass correctly, but I'm learning, so I have avoided any clues that are written with compass bearings. I'll tackle those when I'm a little more oriented to my compass. Some of the clues in my areas are written in poems and figuring out the clues have been a pleasure. My 8 year old son has even mastered a few of the clues written in poetry, so that is a good thing too.
</p><p>I hope this helps.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For me, the excitement comes from the unexpected.  Since we started <br/>
letterboxing less than 3 weeks ago, (has it only been that long!) my <br/>
car has died, we have gotten horribly lost, and last weekend, we <br/>
started on the wrong end of the towpath and walked 4.4 miles for a <br/>
box that was .6 mile if you started at the right place. (well worth <br/>
it since I blackmailed Sarah into making me a homemade chocolate milk <br/>
shake for my trouble)<br/>
<br/>
This is what makes it an adventure and makes finding the box so much <br/>
sweeter.  If you don't take the wrong path, get lost, or stumble <br/>
blindly through the woods at least once, then you are missing out on <br/>
the fun!<br/>
<br/>
So expect the unexpected and enjoy!  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would have to agree with Tammy that the unexpected things are what <br/>
make a letterboxing trip memorable, like being caught a mile out in <br/>
the woods in a torential downpour, but determined not to give up <br/>
looking for the box, and then trying like crazy to keep everything <br/>
dry while stamping in under cover of a huge cedar tree!<br/>
<br/>
As for the location, clues and the box itself...  I like clues that <br/>
make me think or require a little bit of pre-work (research or <br/>
figuring), clues that are written interestingly, something out of the <br/>
ordinary, not just park here, turn right at the big tree, take 10 <br/>
steps and find the box under a rock...  On the other hand, those <br/>
gimmes are kind of nice too, when you are on the way home and want to <br/>
get "just one more box."  I tend to like scenic or historical places <br/>
and boxes that make me hike a bit, but not necessarily climb a <br/>
mountain or swim a river.<br/>
<br/>
What I find in the box can be just as exciting as the journey.  I <br/>
find it interesting to see what the person who placed the box chose <br/>
for the stamp -- of course hand-carved is always a great treat, but <br/>
purchased stamps can also be fun, especially if they are unique or <br/>
fitting to the location or a theme.  I also like log books that are <br/>
unique or crafty.  What it all comes down to is -- did the person who <br/>
placed this box put some thought into it?  Did they truly create a <br/>
treasure for me to find?<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about placing a "boring" box...  everyone likes different <br/>
things and you will probably never please them all, but as long as it <br/>
is something you would enjoy hunting for and finding, chances are a <br/>
good many other people will also.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, by the way...  welcome to Letterboxing!<br/>
