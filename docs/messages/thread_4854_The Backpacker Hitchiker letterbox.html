<br/>
I'm new to letterboxing.  Have  only found 5 boxes to date.  <br/>
Yesterday, we found the Backpacker hitchhiker letterbox on the Batona <br/>
trail in Batsto, NJ.  Deb left an e-mail address, buut it was bounced. <br/>
 I'm hoping that she is either on this group, or someone on this group <br/>
will get the word back to her that her box was found.  I noticed that <br/>
Wanda and Pete are a part of this group.  They've had the box 4 times <br/>
before.  My plan is to plant it next weekend in one of the "mystery" <br/>
locations in NJ.  Happy hunting.<br/>
<br/>

sure does love to travel!  It's true - we've found her four different <br/>
times, and dropped her off in four different states! Each time we see <br/>
her it's  such a thrill - hope she gets to do lots of trails!<br/>
