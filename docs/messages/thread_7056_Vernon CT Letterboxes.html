                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>We have five boxes to report on after today's hiking, all in Vernon CT. 
<br/>
<br/>Blue Moon was a nice quick walk, box in perfect condition. Nice park to play in. We also found the Rare Horned Alligator. It's in great shape, waiting for the next visitor. Nice old cemetary. Might have to steal that placement idea!
<br/>
<br/>We also went to Valley Falls Park. We found the Tortoise and the Hare without any trouble. Both logbooks must be replaced, as they are almost completely full, and the Hare has lost his ears. &lt;g&gt;
<br/>
<br/>We then hiked up to the Valley Falls box. We got to the right place, and found the trees mentioned in the clue, but no box. Does anyone know if this box is officially missing, or who placed it? 
<br/>
