Have you really been to Huntsville several times? I must confess, I <br/>
am not a true, native Huntsvillian. I grew up in Houston,TX and left <br/>
there when I was 20. I joined the Air Force, of all things. But my <br/>
parents are originally from AL and my mother's brother and his wife <br/>
have lived here for about 25 years. I have been here since 95 and I <br/>
love this town. Left for 14 months to live in Nashville and realized <br/>
that Huntsville is in my blood! I hope I never leave North Alabama <br/>
again!<br/>

Neat idea, and I think people would enjoy it.  There is at least one <br/>
letterbox that I know of planted in the Confederate Cemetary in <br/>
Fredericksburg, Virginia (go to CLUES --&gt; Virginia --&gt; Northern <br/>
Virginia --&gt; Confederate Cemetary).  My wife and I enjoyed strolling <br/>
through the cemetary and reading the tombstones as we searched for <br/>
the box.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
