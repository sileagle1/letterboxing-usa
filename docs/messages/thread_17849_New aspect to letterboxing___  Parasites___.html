<br/>
We had an idea that we thought was interesting and<br/>
wanted to share it with everyone to see what you<br/>
thought of it.  Our idea was to make parasites...I<br/>
know that on Silent Doug's site that he makes<br/>
reference to hitchhikers sometimes being called<br/>
"parasites", but we think this is somewhat different<br/>
than the ordinary hitchhiker.  Here is our<br/>
idea...Parasites would attach themselves to or<br/>
"infect" a "host" hitchhiker.  It would then travel<br/>
with that hitchhiker, until a) it was placed in a<br/>
hitchhiker hostel, where it would infect all other<br/>
hitchhikers with it's stamp and move to a new host<br/>
hitchhiker...and then travel again.  Or until, b)it<br/>
finds a new host hitchhiker  by chance in a letterbox.<br/>
Such as finding a hitchhiker when you are dropping one<br/>
off too.  It would then change hosts and be stamped in<br/>
the letterbox log also, and then travel again.  <br/>
<br/>
Any opinions on this??...We think it would be kinda<br/>
cool to see if your hitchhiker, letterbox, or personal<br/>
logbook had been "infected" with a parasite.  To start<br/>
this, we have just finished creating nine stamps of,<br/>
what else?  Parasites!  Kinda gross, kinda funny.  We<br/>
have a tick, bedbug, mosquito, tapeworm, flatworm,<br/>
roundworm, flea, chigger, leech, and a roundworm ready<br/>
to infect hitchhikers.  They are all very small<br/>
stamps.  About 1/2 square or less.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow...just wanted to throw that out there for<br/>
comments.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I applaud the enthusiasm and creativity, but I see a few <br/>
problems with the idea.  The main one being the fact that there is <br/>
usually a lack of space anyway and adding yet another stamp <br/>
and logbook could leave tight lids and more vulnerability to <br/>
leakage.  I'm not thrilled about the idea of trying to coordinate <br/>
three boxes in one swoop, much as I love any new stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
Also there are many, many areas that see very few gatherings <br/>
and may not meet a hitchhiker hostel.  I'm still amazed that <br/>
hitchhikers make their way in and out of here every now and <br/>
then, but it is rarely through gatherings.<br/>
<br/>
My final concern is with changing the meaning of "parasite."  The <br/>
reason they are occasionally called that is because it is proper <br/>
terminology with our letterboxing cohorts across the pond.  I'd <br/>
rather not create further confusion with what is meant by what.  <br/>
To Brittish letterboxers, some of which letterbox here too, a <br/>
parasite is a hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
These are just a few of my thoughts.  I'll let others chime in too.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
There are no rules as we always say, but the terminology in my opinion<br/>
is not very classy and in keeping with the spirit of my approach. This<br/>
is just strictly in my opinion (keep in mind) but I would never use<br/>
the word "parasite" especially in the case of small children and in<br/>
outdoor places where there are really such things. The crossover for<br/>
me also being a scientist is just way too familiar. Perhaps this is<br/>
just a reflection of our all too familiar government imposed scare<br/>
tactics, but I'm NOT comfortable with this idea AT ALL.<br/>
<br/>
I'd agree with Cadenza, boxes are already small enough and to add more<br/>
than a hitchhiker into that equation becomes quite confusing for all<br/>
involved. Best to keep it simple. <br/>

<br/>
While it is true that this 'whatever' we call it, be it Hobby, sport or<br/>
whatever, has no rules, it is also true that there are the unspoken rules.<br/>
I believe, in my own opinion, that the additions of 'parasites' are both<br/>
misnamed and is something that is duplicating what already exists.<br/>
Hitchhikers are, in a sense, parasites, in that they inhabit the body or<br/>
home of another letterbox, not having one themselves.  So, as I see it,<br/>
these 'parasites' are nothing more than 'bugs' and that strikes to close to<br/>
Geocaching for my tastes.  I don't think this is a good workable idea as it<br/>
sits currently.<br/>

What a creative idea! We love it. Way back when, we were lucky enough <br/>
to find the Y2K Bug, the first US hitch hiker, and the creator called <br/>
it a "parasite." I think your more virulent parasites will be very <br/>
popular with finders and placers alike. Kind of reminds me of the <br/>
recent Gang of Eight project: at first glance a stamp of Pol Pot or <br/>
Hitler might seem a bit creepy, but those have become VERY desireable <br/>
collectables. I've seen perfectly normal adults go ape over <br/>
them...surely folks will be eager to catch an infection from the <br/>
newest parasites.<br/>

on a hitchhiker?  Might be a little confusing at first, but I'm sure <br/>
the finder would figure it out.  I haven't seen any HH hostels (or <br/>
HHs for that matter :) out here in CA, but I like the idea of a <br/>
parasite getting into one and "infecting" all the HHs.  The fact that <br/>
the parasite needs another hitchhiker to travel adds something new to <br/>
the fun.  I think it's cute that they're tiny stamps too!  Just make <br/>
sure they're clearly labeled (maybe with a wee laminated tag) that <br/>
explains what to do with it.  If you could find some 2"x2" ziplock <br/>
type baggies (like the kind attached to women's blouses that extra <br/>
buttons come in), those would be good to hold the stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Since it doesn't seem like too many folks call HHs "parasites" these <br/>
days, I don't think it's wrong to use the term in a new way.<br/>
