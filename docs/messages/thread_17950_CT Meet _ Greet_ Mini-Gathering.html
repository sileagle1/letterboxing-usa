<br/>
As you may have heard I am teaching a class for the Trumbull <br/>
Continuing Education entitled "Hiking In Connecticut".  I plan on <br/>
introducing my eight students to all sorts of outdoor hiking <br/>
opportunities including letterboxing, geocaching, and orienteering.  <br/>
On Saturday, March 13th my eight students will be meeting at Putnam <br/>
Memorial State Park in Redding to find their first letterboxes and <br/>
geocaches.  Afterwards we will be heading over to Huntington State <br/>
Park for lunch and to find the Peanuts, Physics 101, and Colis P. <br/>
Huntington letterboxes, as well as several geocaches.  Anyone <br/>
interested in meeting my class to exchange stamps and take a fun <br/>
hike with us are more than welcome to attend.  Please plan on <br/>
meeting at Huntington State Park at 12:00 to exchange stamps and <br/>
chit-chat over bagged lunches.  We will try to hit the trail by <br/>
12:45 (ish).  I hope to see all of my good friends in letterboxing <br/>
as well as some newbies.<br/>
