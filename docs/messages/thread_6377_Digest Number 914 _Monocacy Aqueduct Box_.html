I'm new to letterboxing and didn't find the one at Monocacy Aqueduct.  I'll<br/>
work on it some more once I'm assured it's there!<br/>
<br/>
I do NOT want to receive any additional clues but want to know if anyone has<br/>
recently been successful in finding the letterbox at Monocacy Aqueduct C&amp;O<br/>
Canal Natural Historic Park and Trail, Dickerson, Frederick Co., Maryland.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
My girlfriend and I went looking for that box a month ago and also couldn't<br/>
find it. We searched the woods for an hour or two and had a lot of trouble<br/>
figuring out what the clues pointed to.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I can't confirm that it is there. Maybe the person that planted it is<br/>
aware of it's status?<br/>
<br/>
On a happier note, this box helped us discover the C&amp;O Canal towpaths which<br/>
we have been  biking on frequently since we went to Monocacy.<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 boxes closer to DC along the towpath. One where the Capitol<br/>
Crescent Trail meets the towpath (Mile 3.6ish) and another at Great Falls<br/>
(Mile 14ish)<br/>
<br/>
If you hear more about Monocacy, let us know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
