at the miami whitewater park just west of cincinnati.  i'm currently <br/>
researching boxes at john bryan state park (slightly NE of dayton, <br/>
oh) and found a lot of boxes there placed by flyfisher and franzsolo.<br/>
<br/>
you should try looking at the following web page:<br/>
<br/>
www.flyfisher-kayak.com/cg-bn/wiki.pl<br/>
<br/>
flyfisher has grouped the boxes by state park and area.  it may help <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
ps, i hope that i got the URL correct!<br/>

I am (very) new to letterboxing so haven't tried these myself (yet), but a<br/>
fellow boxer picked up 24 or so boxes in the Chillicothe area one day--that<br/>
would be found in the South Eastern section of the Clues map.  It is not a<br/>
bad drive from Cincinnati.<br/>
<br/>
There are also many in the Cincinnati proper area (Hamilton County), tho it<br/>
is much more urban so you would be dealing with traffic.  It would be a neat<br/>
way to see some of our sights tho!  I expect FranzSolo or Socut Dogs will<br/>
check in--they are definitley more familiar than I.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine boxing in the US is a might different than in the UK.  Would love<br/>
to hear more about your experiences....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know that there are hundreds of boxes in the Cincinnati area though <br/>
I haven't done very many of them personally.  My family and I did go <br/>
down to the Eastfork S.P. near Batavia which is just east of <br/>
Cincinnati proper and managed to get 10 or 12 in 3 or 4 hours while <br/>
herding our easily distracted children along.  I'd recommend you try <br/>
some of those.  There's one trail in particular that has 6 or 8 boxes <br/>
in about a mile.  If I can find my list I'll email you off list.  <br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

rapid and helpful response.   I now have a really good starting <br/>
point and will be collating and discussing this with my better half <br/>
(and letterboxing companion) to see if we can narrow down on a <br/>
particular area and a day and then we'll see about the possibility <br/>
of having a mini-meet. <br/>
<br/>
Mama Stork asked about my experiences.  I've actually only been <br/>
letterboxing a few times.   The first was a few days on Dartmoor (in <br/>
at the deep end) http://www.drawbridge.org.uk/letterboxing.html has <br/>
Gale and my adventure in Dartmoor. It really was surreal and <br/>
magical.  The feeling amplified by the really thick fog that we were <br/>
shrouded in for 3 days. But still, we found over 30 there.  I've <br/>
also been looking for elusive boxes around the South of England.   <br/>
Only found one out of the dozens or so that are there.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to get my numbers up sometime over my fortnight holiday.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again<br/>
