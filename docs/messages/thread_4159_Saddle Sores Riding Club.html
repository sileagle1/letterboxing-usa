<div><span class="900454603-12012002">I recently saw a 
letterbox in Hampton CT that was heavily damaged. All contents on the ground 
wet. The box belongs to the Saddle Sores Riding Club. I am willing to fix this 
box up again but don't know how to contact the owners. What if anything is 
generally done in a case like this. It looks as though the box was planted in 
possibly summer of 1999.....Chuck Straub <a href="mailto:cstraub01@snet.net">cstraub01@snet.net</a></span></div></body></html>

Chuck, you have been busy on the trail you might find the owner of <br/>
the box through the  Cooperative Extension  Office on Wolf Den road <br/>
in Brooklyn I believe that is a  Windham County 4-H group. Another <br/>
place to ask if they have any info is the Park office at Goodwin. I <br/>
heard they had clues to boxes there that are only available at the <br/>
office and not online.  Leader of the Pack<br/>
