I'm going through and cleaning out the inbox this morning....<br/>
naturally I can't help but re-read. What you wrote in this<br/>
post is the tops! If only the everyone could be convinced that<br/>
this is the best of all possible solutions!<br/>
All best,<br/>

&gt; ...I believe, however, that it will be impossible for one page <br/>
&gt;  maintainer to keep pace with the exploding number of clues we are <br/>
&gt;  hoping to see in the near future - no matter how restrictive the <br/>
&gt;  format becomes. And I do not want to see it restricted. I want Randy <br/>
&gt;  and others to be able to exercise their ingenuity to the max.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  The only solution, in my opinion, is a decentralization of host <br/>
&gt;  sites. There needs to be one central map that provides the links to <br/>
&gt;  all states and all clues. If Dan can be the manager of this, that <br/>
&gt;  would be fine with me. He is the one who has pioneered the whole map <br/>
&gt;  approach and done so much of the work (along with Mitch, Erik, Randy, <br/>
&gt;  Thom and others). <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  But the state maps and the clues do not need to be all located on the <br/>
&gt;  same site. Many people can host these and the creating/editing <br/>
&gt;  responsibilities shared. People who do not create their own clue <br/>
&gt;  pages can have a choice of site and site editor. (I think most people <br/>
&gt;  will choose to have Dan continue to do this, but Dan WILL very soon <br/>
&gt;  reach a limit of the number of clues he can publish.)...<br/>
