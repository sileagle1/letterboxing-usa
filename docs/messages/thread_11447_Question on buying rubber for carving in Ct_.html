That is the only place I go to get my carving material. (Only place I know of). Go in the main door, take first right. It's in the center of that room.I know that at least one female person working there knows about letterboxers but the material is where you can see it and I think it is inexpensive....Chuck and Molly

Hi Teach and Preach, Yes the Lily Pad now carries the Pink stuff <br/>
regularly at my request and they know me by my name and some by <br/>
leader of the pack.  If they are low on supply or out please let them <br/>
know at the counter so they can reorder.  They also have the carving <br/>
tools on the wall and a starter kit that makes a nice gift. They have <br/>
bass wood in the back of the store for mounting stamps .I bought  a <br/>
coping saw at the hardware store and have just started using this for <br/>
backing ,works well .   A second material I use for small stamps are <br/>
the white erasers from the dollar store in East Brook mall. They come <br/>
six to a pack for $1.oo they carve like butter! When entering the <br/>
store they are on the right hand wall.  I have asked AC Moore in <br/>
Buckland to carry the Pink as well but so far I haven't seen it but <br/>
they have ink pads for $1.00 I usually grab a bunch to make the trip <br/>
worth while.  Unique and safe for little kids try plucking a design <br/>
with tweezers nice for trees and clouds etc. Very fine point <br/>
scissors  for needle work do nice snip work too. Lots of exacto knife <br/>
cutters at Lily Pad too . Leader of the Pack  <br/>
