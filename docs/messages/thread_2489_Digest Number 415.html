&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yesterday John and I went out on the Marquam Trail and got that<br/>
&gt;letterbox under our belt.  What a great trail.  They had been working on<br/>
&gt;it earlier in the day, so we were lucky to get a freshly maintained path<br/>
&gt;all the way up to Council Crest.  Thanks to Der Mad Stamper for placing<br/>
&gt;a stamp in another beautiful place I had never been to before.  Ryan was<br/>
&gt;the first to stamp in.  What a cute signature stamp, guy!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It's early here on the West Coast right now, but we may head out soon.<br/>
&gt;I hear there's a duck that needs rescueing over near the Coast!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;In England letterbox "walks" are often set out in Dartmoor. They consist of<br/>
about 12 +/- boxes set in a circular rout of 2-8 miles. There is usually<br/>
only a stamp in each box, with the visitors book located only in the last<br/>
box. Sometimes the last box is located with a person who checks to see if<br/>
all the stamps have been collected by the hunters before releasing the last<br/>
stamp in the series. They are designed to provide a full day's letterboxing<br/>
adventure which yields several stamps. The clues are to be purchased with a<br/>
donation to the sponsoring organization, and the series is only available<br/>
for a specified period of time.<br/>

&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was wondering if the Point Mountain New Jersey Letterbox was still<br/>
&gt;out there.  I went on 5/25/01 and was unable to locate it.  Before I<br/>
&gt;set out I realized that the box was planted in 99, so there was a<br/>
&gt;chance that it was no longer was there.  With or without the box it<br/>
&gt;was a great circuit hike.  Besides a nice walk along a river, where a<br/>
&gt;wild turkey and myself scared the stuffings out of one another, there<br/>
&gt;is a challenging climb with several great views.<br/>

&gt;Just got back from a short trip to Stockbridge, Ma. with "You Inspire My<br/>
Spirit".<br/>
&gt;While we were out there we located the following boxes. All are in great<br/>
shape.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Norman Rockwell Museum.<br/>
&gt;The trail starting at the lightpole in the southwest corner of the parking<br/>
lot is a little overgrown, but once you spot the road and find pole 18,<br/>
everything comes together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Monument Mountain<br/>
&gt;By all means climb to the top of the mountain after you find the box, the<br/>
views are fantastic and the trails are wonderful. Come down on the red trail<br/>
and you will find a super waterfall with a cave beneath.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Craggy Knoll<br/>
&gt;We could not spend the time we would have like to in this beautiful site,<br/>
the mosquitoes were outrageous. This may be a great fall visit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lion's Head<br/>
&gt;Nice climb, great views and lots and lots of finders who came across the<br/>
box without looking for it. Nice of them to log in, record their comments<br/>
and replace the box.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Mainline<br/>
&gt;How do you find these places Jay? The climb up along that stream, crossing<br/>
and recrossing was a highlight of the hike. You do tend to underestimate the<br/>
degree of difficulty. Little children may have a hard time with this one.<br/>
Pete and Wanda, this one is made for you.<br/>

&gt;Hey Wingfoot!<br/>
&gt;Point Mt. is still there, it was checked by it's parent a few days ago..she<br/>
&gt;would have been thrilled to see your stamp!<br/>
&gt;On Friday I located a box I had been unable to locate the first time<br/>
&gt;out...I've done it before and will likely do it again...my personal<br/>
tendency<br/>
&gt;is to make the last few moments of the find more difficult than needs be!<br/>
&gt;What fun when you find it on the second go :) Twice now it's been a,<br/>
&gt;"DUH!!",head smack, moment for me when I make it to the box... come to<br/>
think<br/>
&gt;of it,I've had lots'o those moments on trail..<br/>
&gt;Happy 'boxing!!<br/>

&gt;Subject: RE: Regicides Trail, New Haven, CT<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just came back from visiting the Regicides Trail letterbox.  The box is<br/>
&gt;alive and well.  It is great to have day out in a park like that and learn<br/>
&gt;something too.  Thanks Aili &amp; Bruce for the history and a very appropriate<br/>
&gt;stamp.  If someone is not familiar with Southern Connecticut State<br/>
&gt;University you can get there by taking the Route 10 exit off of I95, stay<br/>
on<br/>
&gt;Route 10 until you reach Fitch, turn right on Fitch and Wintergreen is a<br/>
&gt;left when you reach S.C.S.U.  The park and the history lesson are worth the<br/>
&gt;trip.  I would also recommend you consider taking the blue trail along the<br/>
&gt;ridge either on the way out or the way back, the views are spectacular.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One note on the clues:  The vegetation has grown up so much that the rock<br/>
&gt;pile referenced in the final clue is no longer visible from the top of the<br/>
&gt;"cave", I just sighted some trees from the top due south, walked to them<br/>
and<br/>
&gt;found the  rock pile when I reached the trees I had sighted.<br/>

&gt;We went to No Chernobyl Today and found the "Clean Up Letterbox". We<br/>
&gt;found the small rock pile<br/>
&gt;at the top of the wall just after the number three marker. The odd thing<br/>
&gt;is that the pile in which the<br/>
&gt;box should have been was still intact - just empty.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Warm Waters a No Chernobyl is just fine!<br/>

&gt;Subject: Paying the bills at LbNA<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Regarding some comments on Friday:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    The website does cost something,  about $25.00 a month.  The costs<br/>
&gt;have been met through contributions by some of the earlier members.  All<br/>
&gt;the work has been done on a volunteer basis.  As our site and hobby have<br/>
&gt;grown, various people have contributed both time and money.  As the<br/>
&gt;years move on it is probable that there will be shortages of both Time<br/>
&gt;and Money so your Webmasters have been discussing ways of meeting needs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Monetary contributions would be appreciated.  If you would like to<br/>
&gt;offer financial backing please email us at<br/>
&gt;LbNA-Webmasters@yahoogroups.com  When we figure out how to manage this,<br/>
&gt;we will gladly accept your participation!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Time = updated clues.  The best way for us to handle clues is to<br/>
&gt;link to clue pages on other servers but we do realize this is not<br/>
&gt;feasible for some people.  We are discussing ways to accept editing help<br/>
&gt;while minimizing server access (it would just get too complicated if a<br/>
&gt;lot of people could upload).  This would involve working on copies of<br/>
&gt;the pages and emailng them back to the person in charge of a specific<br/>
&gt;geographic area.  If you have skills in this area and would like to<br/>
&gt;offer some help, please email us at LbNA-Webmasters@yahoogroups.com<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Best regards,<br/>

&gt;Speaking of this, how are the bills paid?  I assume the web site must<br/>
&gt;cost<br/>
&gt;something.  Is there a mechanism in place to accept donations to cover<br/>
&gt;these<br/>
&gt;costs?<br/>

&gt;I hereby place my "Letterboxing in America" FAQ in the public<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I hereby place the name "Letterboxing North America", which I<br/>
&gt;came up with, in the public domain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To me this is trivial, like the _Seinfeld_ episode where Jerry<br/>
&gt;claims to have invented the umbrella twirl, and Elaine says<br/>
&gt;"That needed to be invented". :-)  I never really thought about<br/>
&gt;it until the geocaching folks started using the "L" word over<br/>
&gt;their name, and Matt Stum, creater of the term "geocaching", placed<br/>
&gt;that in the public domain recently.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry to bother y'all with this, but now I can sleep knowing that no<br/>
&gt;one need pay me fat royalty fees for these gems :-)<br/>

&gt;Glad you liked our stamp, etc. The story of the Three Judges has<br/>
&gt;been, to me, an example of what we "Yanks" will go through to gain<br/>
&gt;and keep our liberties. Few may know that the town of Old Saybrook<br/>
&gt;was begun as a refuge for Oliver Cromwell and his supporters, though<br/>
&gt;the "Lord Protector" never made it here. Long before the seeds of<br/>
&gt;Revolution were sown, we held our freedom and independence very dear.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are many ways to reach the park, it just seemed finding one's<br/>
&gt;best way to the college was easiest. From the Merritt Parkway, Exit<br/>
&gt;60-Dixwell Ave, you will see signs on the right just a bit south of<br/>
&gt;the off-ramps, which lead you though a prettier neighborhood, though<br/>
&gt;the way is probably longer.  Oh, and the Merritt cuts under,<br/>
&gt;not through, the park.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here is a map for any interested, the entrance to the park being near<br/>
&gt;Tierney Rd.<br/>

snapping turtle on the side on the path.  We are looking forward to coming<br/>
back soon without Max to kayak in the pond and find your box.  It looks like<br/>
a really great place to paddle some sunny afternoon.  Keep up the great<br/>
work!<br/>

&gt;Subject: Paddle to the Sea<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I clicked on the clues for Paddle to the Sea on the letterbox website,<br/>
I was given the old clues cut off after the old You Otter See This was<br/>
hidden.  Since Paddle to the Sea is further along the path the directions to<br/>
this box were not there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Carolyn- We also wanted to tell you that we picked up your "Run like a<br/>
Deer" hitchhiker at Avery Light Friday night.<br/>
