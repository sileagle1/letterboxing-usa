&gt; &gt;This box was reported missing a couple of months ago, and yes it was due<br/>
&gt; &gt;to the trail maintenance.<br/>

&gt;Wow, nobody told my son and I that when we found it in late August, I<br/>
&gt;believe it was. It wasn't in the exact spot, but it was near enough and<br/>
&gt;visible enough for us to find. We had considerable difficulty finding the<br/>
&gt;appropriate bridges and when we did the box was in an out of bounds area,<br/>
&gt;at the time. Maybe it has been declared lost since. Wish I had a chance to<br/>
&gt;get out there for a look see. I can advise Jay as to where I found it if<br/>
&gt;necessary.<br/>

I just wanted to clarify the subject of this post of mine. First, I <br/>
recognize that I need to change the subject header if I reply from the <br/>
digest. Second, I am referring to the Gillette Castle 2nd box that someone <br/>
else asked about and lonemasswolf above mentioned was missing. Hope this <br/>
clears things up :-)<br/>
