It's about time we take this hobby to the next level - <br/>
maybe McDonalds can even post a letterboxing menu next to their food menu:<br/>
<br/>
#1 - Today's Driveby<br/>
#2 - Letterboxing Trading Card of the Week<br/>
#3 - Happy Meal Geocache Goodie of the Month<br/>
#4 - Boxer of the Year (I nominate Ryan for the first one because of this wonderful McBoxing thing)<br/>

Now - all we need is to sell this to Burger King so we can "have it our way!"<br/>
