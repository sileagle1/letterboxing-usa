properly.  It usually took the 3 of us to get it to work in the <br/>
first place but now that Sarah is busy with art school, our P-ness <br/>
has been neglected.  I am desperate to get our P-ness back in <br/>
working order.  Gentle coaxing and kind words may do the trick.  If <br/>
that doesn't work, are there any miracle drugs out there?  Something <br/>
to get our P-ness back on its feet, to stiffen its resolve?<br/>
