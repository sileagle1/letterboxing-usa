Judith and Sparky - I appreciate the response and I would count seredipitous finds (SF's?).  <br/>
I intended to respond to the serious question of counting letterbox types with a sly <br/>
inference to the recent flurry of posts re: bad language.  I guess "my point" was <br/>
overlooked.<br/>
<br/>
speedsquare, who wasn't trying to be so obtuse (hehehehahahaha)<br/>
<br/>
Before you get flamed, Eli, just be careful about asking specific box questions.  Contact <br/>
the placer directly.<br/>

Thanks for the warnign speedsquare, but I think about everything I say<br/>
and am no newbie to boards or letterboxing.  I asked only for the box<br/>
they were looking for, and I know Judith is smart enough not to answer<br/>
if it would be inappropriate.   But thank you for looking out for me.  <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Eli<br/>

I was thinking if someone accidentally found a mystery box and identified the location of a <br/>
regular letterbox nearby, that the placer might be sorry the general location's cover had <br/>
been identified.  Nothing more.  Perhaps I was too protective of Eli (sorry.) I hope to find <br/>
some letterboxes like that!<br/>

I don't know why but reading that made me laugh out loud.  It's always<br/>
good to have a big brother or sister looking out for you, it's just<br/>
that I'm not used ot it being the oldest of 8.<br/>
