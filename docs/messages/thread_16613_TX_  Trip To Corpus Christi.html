Lexington Aircraft carrier in Corpus Christi with his<br/>
Cub Scout Pack, so we decided to make a weekend of it<br/>
and do some letterboxing along the way.  We left Friday<br/>
afternoon and drove to Beeville, Skidmore and San Patricio,<br/>
where we found letterboxes by Busy Bee.  They were in <br/>
interesting places and we learned a few things while boxing.<br/>
We then went to Lake Corpus Christi to camp for the night and <br/>
found two boxes by Baby Bear.  The weather was hot for this time <br/>
of year, even by Texas standards (upper 80s), and it was a<br/>
little warm in the tent, but we had a nice spot by the lake.<br/>
The next day we were up at dawn and on to Sinton for<br/>
more of Busy Bee's and Baby Bear's boxes.  I got careless<br/>
replacing one of the boxes and got stung by a scorpion, but<br/>
it did not stop us.  We proceeded on to Funhog's P-3 box<br/>
in Portland before boarding the Lexington.  After stowing our<br/>
gear and eating lunch, we had 3 hours of free time, so we left<br/>
the ship and headed to Padre Island to play on the beach and<br/>
swim in the Gulf.  I managed to place 2 boxes on the way and<br/>
we had fun body surfing and making sand castles.  What a beautiful<br/>
place with white sand and blue water.  It is hard to believe<br/>
it is the same Gulf Of Mexico that I normally swim in at <br/>
Galveston, where the water is brown from the Mississippi River<br/>
silt.  We returned to the ship and had fun touring and pretending<br/>
to be sailors.  <br/>
That night, a cold front came through with thunderstorms<br/>
and the temperature dropped over 30 degrees, so when we left<br/>
the ship the next day it was cold (in the 50s), especially<br/>
since we did not bring warm clothes.  It did not stop us<br/>
from letterboxing on our way home.  We drove to Aransas Pass,<br/>
Rockport, Goose Island and Aransas National Wildlife Refuge,<br/>
finding boxes by Baby Bear, Busy Bee, Wow Mom, and Funhog.<br/>
We even got to see Whooping Cranes at Aransas NWR, the first<br/>
to arrive this year!<br/>
Our final stop was at Lake Texana, where we found a box by<br/>
Baby Bear and placed one of mine.  By now it was raining and<br/>
we were ready to get home, but we had a fun weekend.  We<br/>
ended up finding 26 letterboxes and placing 3 and having a<br/>
great time.  I highly recommend a similar itinerary for anyone<br/>
wanting to visit Texas in the winter, especially if you start<br/>
in the San Antonio area.  Thanks to everyone that placed these<br/>
boxes, we really enjoyed the hunt!<br/>
