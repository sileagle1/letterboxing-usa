<br/>
The latest and greatest adventure is ready for your consumption at <br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/adventures/vol51/<br/>
<br/>
In other news, today--yes, today!--is the last day of the Hike-A-Thon,<br/>
and I managed to log 106.5 miles.  Thanks so much to all of you who <br/>
have pledged for it.  You guys have managed to raise over $500!  <br/>
<br/>
And if you haven't pledged, it's still not too late.  ;o)  I'll <br/>
happily give the WTA any checks that come in for the next week or so, <br/>
but I have to get them the payments by the 10th, so any donations <br/>
must be received by then.<br/>
<br/>
You can log a pledge on my website at <br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/hikeathon/pledge.html and I'll e-mail you <br/>
with information about where to send the check!  Just remember, I <br/>
need to get all payments in by September 10th!<br/>
<br/>
Talk to you later!  =)<br/>
