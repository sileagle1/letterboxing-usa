<br/>
Keep in mind that this "history" some refer to <br/>
generally means the "post Smithsonian" era, which <br/>
means +04/98. There is, of course, "history" in <br/>
American letterboxing before then. <br/>
<br/>
This has the effect of making alot of "first this/ <br/>
first that" wrong. Moreover, there are other <br/>
inaccuracies here and there. Since this list <br/>
doesn't go back to 04/98, you have to find the <br/>
personal e-mail records of the people who where there <br/>
to sort it all out. Etiquette prevents posting these <br/>
on the web, otherwise it would be kinda cool. <br/>
<br/>
So, like most things, this "history" is in the eye <br/>
of the beholder, and, as in all history, subject to <br/>
revision (unintentional and intentional) by various <br/>
commentators over the years. <br/>
<br/>
That said, it was my impression that the original <br/>
comment on history and founding (*)thers was querying <br/>
information on non-Americans. <br/>
<br/>
