                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wondering if the Ohio letterbox listing on the LbNA site will be <br/>
updated in the near future? I'm not really too knowledgeable on the <br/>
way websites work, but if I understand some previous messages <br/>
correctly, a volunteer, "Ruthann" is responsible for getting most of <br/>
this area's clues transferred to the site. I realize this has to be a <br/>
huge undertaking so I'm certainly not complaining; on the contrary, I <br/>
thank her for doing all this so we can all enjoy our letterboxing <br/>
pursuits! I was just somewhat concerned that perhaps I wasn't sending <br/>
my more recent clues to the right place--that the procedure may have <br/>
changed? (I wasn't kidding earlier, I am really a novice when it <br/>
comes to e-mail/computers/internet stuff, and am trying to learn as I <br/>
go along).So thanks for any input anyone might have, and thanks again <br/>
to Ruthann and everyone who does all the more complicated work for <br/>
the rest of us! Happy letterboxing, Salamander.<br/>
