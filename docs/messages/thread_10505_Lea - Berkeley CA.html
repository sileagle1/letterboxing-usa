The "C" up on tightwad hill is guarded savagely so those pesky "Trees/Indians" don't paint it red. Sometimes, if it gets cold and there's a real threat, the look-outs have to keep warm by building a fire. This is more prevalent than a full-fledged bonfire but they do happen.<br/>

We'll be waiting anxiously for more boxes from you although, I have to admit, Marin is not as big a draw as Cal was. (You see my husbands "handle" is Old Blue and his stamp, a Ca. Brown Bear). By the way, we attended the Big Game with Old Blue's parents. There are 4 generations of Cal alum in his family, soon to be 5 with our daughter<br/>

Thanks again!<br/>
