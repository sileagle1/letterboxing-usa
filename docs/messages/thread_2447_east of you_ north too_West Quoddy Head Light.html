West Quoddy Head, Maine, is likely a very long drive from where you live.  <br/>
This may in some cases amount to more than a day of being trapped in the car <br/>
with family members or significant others, which has been shown to be <br/>
detrimental to relationships.  Is one more little stamp in your journal <br/>
really worth jeopardizing these relationships?  If so, here is a partial <br/>
checklist of things you should bring:<br/>
<br/>
Money.  Lots of it.  Maine depends on your tourist dollars.<br/>
<br/>
A gamut of clothing, particularly something warm.  West Quoddy in particular <br/>
gets about 60 days of fog annually.<br/>
<br/>
Bug spray.  Lots of it (better: buy it here.)<br/>
<br/>
A map.  Or just drive until you are boxed in by Canada and the Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Remember to have fun and be safe!<br/>
<br/>
Additional Disclaimer:<br/>
<br/>
This stamp has a wood backer which may have splinters and rough edges.  <br/>
Please wear gloves and eye protection while handling it.  Gloves are also <br/>
recommended when reaching into potential hiding places.  Although  Maine has <br/>
no venomous serpents, the rodents here can be quite voracious... as can the <br/>
mosquitoes.<br/>
<br/>

For those intrepid enough to make the journey... the box contains a bonus!  <br/>

up to Orland to help the HOME community build housing for the poor.  <br/>
I never had a chance to get back to Quoddy.  If I make it up there <br/>

There were a series of them when I was there 2 years ago.  I found one and<br/>
searched a long time for the second in the series to no avail.  It was a<br/>
