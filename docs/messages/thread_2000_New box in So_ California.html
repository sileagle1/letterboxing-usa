near future). Here are his instructions:<br/>
<br/>
The Conejo Open Space Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is located near Thousand Oaks, off of the 101 freeway in <br/>
Ventura County.  Exit the 101 freeway at Hampshire Road and turn <br/>
south.  About 1/2 mile from the freeway turn right onto Triunfo Canyon <br/>
Road.  Drive another 1/2 mile and take the first right turn after Triunfo <br/>
Park.  Continue up and to the right until you reach a cul-de-sac.  The <br/>
number of the last house on the left is 981, on the right, 982.  Park your car.<br/>
<br/>
A trail exits the cul-de-sac heading northward at about 340 degrees.  At <br/>
the top of the first climb you will find that you are on a ridgeline.  A <br/>
trail to your left at 160 degrees leads up a hill; ignore this trail.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on. . . passing first a trail, then a fire road to your <br/>
right.  After a short distance and a couple of climbs, you should be able <br/>
to look to your right and see right up the 23 freeway where it joins the <br/>
101 freeway.  About the time you first see the junction, it will be at true <br/>
north, 0 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
The trail passes over rocky outcroppings--or maybe very old concrete--and <br/>
starts to head downward.  At this time the 23-101 junction will be about 5 <br/>
degrees; the junction will pass out of sight as you head downhill.<br/>
<br/>
A fairly steep, rough, rocky descent ensues.  When the trail levels off, a <br/>
smaller trail leads off to the right at 290 degrees; follow this trail.<br/>
<br/>
As you follow this smaller trail, look to the left toward the near hills <br/>
and you will see two electrical towers.  When the left tower is at 225 <br/>
degrees, and the right tower at 240 degrees, leave the trail on a bearing <br/>
of 200 degrees toward a lone yucca bush about 36 steps away.<br/>
<br/>
 From the yucca proceed 4 steps at 160 degrees.  That for which you quest <br/>
is located beneath a small cairn of rocks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
1.  All bearings given are from true north, that is, declination <br/>
applied.  The local declination is 14 degrees east.<br/>
<br/>
2.  The hike should take about 2 hours round-trip at an easy pace.<br/>
<br/>
3.  The technical intensity of the hike is moderate, includes a good deal <br/>
of rise and fall and the trail is quite rocky.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Watch out for ticks and rattlesnakes.<br/>
