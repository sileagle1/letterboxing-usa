<br/>
I check the weather to see what to wear. Don't ask...<br/>
<br/>
I check the car to be sure I have enough gas to get<br/>
home again. Don't ask.....<br/>
<br/>
I check the BP to be sure everything we need is in<br/>
there. HA! This is one we haven't forgotten...yet.<br/>
<br/>
BUT FIRST we pick the LB we will look for today. <br/>
Is it easy or hard to get to and can we even begin to<br/>
understand the clues or do we need to figure out or<br/>
research them BEFORE we go?<br/>
<br/>
I READ the clues to see if we can handle the walk<br/>
BEFORE we leave. DS is just off of back surgery. <br/>
<br/>
Why complain about an box not being what you want if<br/>
you didn't read it BEFORE you went? Besides I am<br/>
always grateful someone took the effort to put a box<br/>
out for ME to look for.<br/>
<br/>
If we can't find the box I would email the placer, say<br/>
we could not find the box, state what we did and ask<br/>
nicely if we could have a teensy, tiny, itty bitty,<br/>
clue....Okay we would actually throw ourselves on the<br/>
mercy of the placer and ask for help.<br/>
<br/>
I've heard grovelling is helpful in some cases....<br/>
