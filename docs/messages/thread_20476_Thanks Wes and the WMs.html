Thanks to all of you for taking such good care of the LbNA website. I <br/>
don't think we appreciate enough all that you do, gratis. In spite of <br/>
all the negative rhetoric that erupts here, perspective calls for <br/>
thanking you all for being responsive and duty-bound with your <br/>
tireless efforts at maintaining the LbNA website as a wonderfully <br/>
reliable and easy-to-use resource for FAQs, Clues and Links. Where <br/>
would we be without you?  <br/>
<br/>

so <br/>
&gt; I just copy the database down every night.  Shoot, I think I've got <br/>
a <br/>
