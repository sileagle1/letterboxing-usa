I too am not very artistic and was so impressed by the stamps carved by the <br/>
talented Lb'ers (I truly believed some were drawings--which I couldn't do <br/>
either!) I thought I'd never even try to carve one. Then, as I started being <br/>
impressed by the great hand-carved stamps in the letterboxes I found plus the <br/>
Smithsonian suggesting this is a true American art form, I began to think about an <br/>
attempt myself. Know what? It's FUN! The feeling of the carver slicing through <br/>
"the pink stuff" is amazing! I tried just a design the first time instead of a <br/>
'still life' or a portrait or some 'thing'. A mistake on a design is just <br/>
another design!<br/>
<br/>
My latest is a Zodiac series so I carved a Ram (Aries), then a Bull (Taurus) <br/>
and although they may look like a 3rd grader's drawing, you can still tell <br/>
what they are and I've even gotten compliments! (Thanks H&amp;S!) <br/>
<br/>
Really--I encourage you to try it--you'll like it! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm interested in doing some carving. Do you know of any sights with info on how to start i.e., materials to use, knives, sizes, etc. Finding stamps that match my locations seems to be hard to do, so I thought carving something that fit would be the way to go. Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks, Downeaster41<br/>
