clues, so I'm going to send this both ways.  It loses the formatting when I <br/>
cut and paste.  I've <br/>
gone through it to make it understandable, but I'm not sure it will help much.<br/>
Anyway, thanks for all your your help.<br/>

Planted: May 18, 2002  by M &amp; P<br/>
Terrain Difficulty: Easy, short hike.  Less than an hour<br/>
Clue Difficulty: Easy<br/>
Suggested Equipment: Northern Harriman State Park Trail Map 4  Published by <br/>
NY-NJTrail Conference, hiking boots,walking stick, compass, water. <br/>
Directions to Trailhead: Palisades Interstate Parkway or Route 17 to Seven <br/>
Lakes Drive to the Tiorati Circle to Tiorati Brook Road*(road to the east in <br/>
the circle).  About .9 mile on Tiorati Brook Road you’ll see a sign on the <br/>
left pointing to the Tiorati Workshop on the right.  The driveway is gated, <br/>
but you can park in the area before the gate as long as you don’t block it.  <br/>
If the gate is open, Do Not drive down and park because there’s no guarantee <br/>
the gate will be open when you get back to your car.   *Tiorati Brook Road is <br/>
closed from November 1st to April 1st. If you go on your search during this <br/>
time, you’ll have to park at the circle and walk .7 mile along Tiorati Brook <br/>
Road to the pyramid shaped rock on the right. </div>
