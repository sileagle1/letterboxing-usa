Yup, I finished my "monster countdown" just last night, after five <br/>
fantastic days of monster hunting, mashing, knoshing and partying! It <br/>
was phenomenal - got nearly a hundred new exchanges (not counting the <br/>
extra people for those who use one stamp as couples or families!), <br/>
and over 130 new monsters!!! Over half a dozen Frankensteins alone, <br/>
with similar numbers of vampires, werewolves and various others, and <br/>
many unique "beauties" as well!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was getting down to my last few monster hunting locations <br/>
yesterday when I realized that I could quite possibly "finish them <br/>
all off" and not have to make another "commute" up from RI! Monday <br/>
Pete had been a bit concerned about me hiking alone late in the day <br/>
(and being late with dinner!:-) because he knows that I don't see <br/>
well, especially at night. That evening I'd had some trouble spotting <br/>
Grendel's chair, even though it's huge and I knew where it was from <br/>
having had my picture taken there many years ago! I ended up spending <br/>
a lot of time going back and forth bewildered in the dark, so he made <br/>
me promise not to go 'boxing alone after dusk again.<br/>
<br/>
Well, yesterday (since I still always take the time to stamp in and <br/>
write something personal in every logbook) I found myself finishing <br/>
up my last MMM series - Phynstar's "Dr. Who" - just around dusk, and <br/>
had only one single monster left to hunt down: the "Wendigo". This <br/>
was actually the first monster I was going to look for on Friday, <br/>
after we got back from New Mexico, but it seemed like there had been <br/>
a lot of rain in the area, swelling the local streams, so I thought <br/>
I'd hold off on that one till the end. Now, here it was - dark - but <br/>
I wanted just that one more monster, so what was I to do? I went to <br/>
ask Carolyn, Leader of the Pack and initial creator of the "Mansfield <br/>
letterboxing mecca", who lives down the street, if she would join me <br/>
in tracking down that last monster!<br/>
<br/>
So, after chatting, eating, and sending homeschooling kids off with <br/>
their parents, off we headed into the chill night air - only to find <br/>
police cars with search lights on patrolling the area we wanted to go <br/>
into! Hmmm...we didn't want them to get suspicious and think we were <br/>
doing a "Shady Deal in Sunny Acres" (no, just looking for a wendigo, <br/>
really!), so we pretended we were walking laps around the park. <br/>
Around and around we went until finally the police cars turned around <br/>
to focus on the house across the street. Then off we went into the <br/>
woods! <br/>
<br/>
Minutes later, we reached the still somewhat swollen stream with a <br/>
small rock in the middle balanced on another that was submerged. I <br/>
tried to step carefully onto a stable spot, but the rock wiggled, and <br/>
down I tumbled into the water! Somehow I didn't get hurt, though - <br/>
only got one leg soaked, so we squished on up to the "Wendigo", and <br/>
had our own little stamp-in celebration. What a great finale for my <br/>
monster hunting expeditions!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone who helped make the Monster Mash such a huge <br/>
roaring success, and especially to Chuck who did the lion's share of <br/>
the planning and planting to make it all come together! He did a <br/>
terrific job of showing off many of Mansfield's bountiful trails, and <br/>
the weather complied beautifully, too! Hope the great fall weather <br/>
continues for all those who plan to keep searching for these <br/>
magnificent monsters in the weeks to come!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>

only one box left and realize it was dark, police buzzed, and moat <br/>

I feel pretty good doing 63 in two evenings and two long mornings.  <br/>

I'm sorry but I was just teasing about the bonus. <br/>
In my teasing, I apologize if I've caused any of you a problem or undue<br/>
stress.<br/>
I have already heard about it from Sue and Wanda!!! <br/>
What was meant as a joke, got me in trouble.<br/>
But, it's something I'm getting used to at this point.<br/>
<br/>
I congratulate Wanda for not only being the champion Monster-slayer but<br/>
for her recent accomplishment of breaking another F barrier. <br/>
<br/>
Now - back to the regularly scheduled mischievous post from Mark.<br/>
<br/>
HAVE FUN and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

I was at your Frankenstein box on Friday but I couldn't find any <br/>
bonus clues in either log book or anywhere else in the box.  Is the <br/>
bonus still there?  I've got 33 monsters and counting.<br/>

stamps in the coffin boxes and even got some signature stamps when he went to <br/>
the store to get that stamp.  I am sooooo jealous.  He is in Ct and I'm on Long <br/>
Island, THE  LETTERBOX DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
He will be ahead of me in F's by next weekend I'm sure. I have created a <br/>
monster.<br/>
