weather at the 4-Hearted Fitton's first letterbox, Bartlett Brook <br/>
(www.letterboxing.org/ma/bartlett.htm). Great job! We saw a turtle on <br/>
the way in, but on the way out we were lucky to see, for only the <br/>
second time in my life and the first for my kids, a mink! The second <br/>
field is truly grasshopper heaven: there were millions of them there. <br/>
And only there: we wondered why and looked them up in an insect  <br/>
book. Predicatbly, they were breeding. thanks again for a great day!<br/>
