                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi folks,<br/>
I am hoping to take my son to Washington DC at the end of this month. We will be taking the Amtrak from Newport News Va to DC and we are looking for a cheap place to stay that is within walking distance or cab ride near the Metro lines. We're not picky, just have a very limited budget. We're planning this for July 31 - August 3. I want my 9 year old to experience getting around on public transportation and I hope to show him a number of different sites in the city. Of course we'll be looking for letterboxes in the city too, as long as we can get there by Metro or on foot.We'd also love to meet any boxers in the area if we can. Please send me any sugestions you might have.<br/>
Thank for your help.<br/>
Susan and Mac<br/>
