difficulty: clues - easy, hike - loooong, easy. ride - not-so-long, really <br/>
easy.<br/>
<br/>
This is a semi-mystery without being much of one at all.  However, it IS <br/>
intended to be ridden to on a bike rather than hiked to, as it's long and <br/>
on a bike trail.  (Unless you're an IALC marathon runner, and you're <br/>
allowed to run, dearie.)  The stamp was carved on-site, and is, thus, <br/>
relatively crappy.  You are warned.  (In fact, it'll be posted on <br/>
http://moderngypsy.livejournal.com shortly, so you can see ahead of time if <br/>
it's even worth your effort.)<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
Start on Eastlake Avenue.  Park near the University Bridge and ride your <br/>
bike/walk over it.  Take the cloverleaf that first exits right and follow <br/>
it to the bottom.  At the bottom, turn left and go through two stop signs <br/>
(stopping first, of course, for safety).  Turn right and go roughly a <br/>
block, to where a paved trail intersects the roadway.  Turn left (east) <br/>
onto the trail and ride.<br/>
<br/>
Go a long way.  I do mean that, too.  A -long- way.  You'll eventually <br/>
reach somewhere they're diverting bike traffic at a park with a detour <br/>
while they build a bridge.  (If you're getting this after 12/03, you won't <br/>
be diverted.  Just go past a silver cloud, mile 6, and a wooden bridge that <br/>
makes noise when you ride over it, and you'll get to a tiny park.  That's <br/>
it.)  If you hit a wooden staircase on your right that goes up to Sand <br/>
Point, you've gone way too far.  Go back.<br/>
<br/>
Zip on into the park, despite the signs.  If you go down toward the <br/>
basketball hoops, you'll see the bike rack.  Park your bike.  Behind you is <br/>
an amazing tree that you can climb inside of and have arms all around <br/>
you.  Do that.<br/>
<br/>
Now whip out the compass.  At 55 degrees, the last rock in the retaining <br/>
wall sits.  Between it and the other rock, under some bark and other <br/>
botanical junk-o-la, is the box.  Luckily, the only snake around here is on <br/>
the stamp, as far as I know -- but feel free to poke with a stick first, <br/>
for safety. :)<br/>
