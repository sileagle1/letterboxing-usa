Subject: Exchanges...okay - is there a secret handshake or something?<br/>
<br/>
The secret handshake involves only your hand that has stamp pad ink on it<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
How to tell another letterboxer has been discussed, but what I recall is:<br/>
a) You can tell because the person is holding clues, and a compass &amp; looking<br/>
lost (or determined) :-)<br/>
b) Look for ink on the fingers (harder now that everyone is wearing gloves)<br/>
c) Ask them if they know what LBNA is, if they don't know, you can either<br/>
tell them what it is or say never mind.<br/>
d) Some people have the logo patches on their pack, coat or hat<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

Okay - another question from the newbie...<br/>
<br/>
If I see someone on the trail - how, exactly, so we know if they are a<br/>
fellow<br/>
boxer?  Given the desire to keep covert when stamping, how do we know?<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to exchange, but I don't know the secret handshake...  Short of<br/>
adding<br/>
"I am letterboxing" to my blaze orange hat - what's a new boxer to do?<br/>
<br/>
Or...is the point to spread the word about letterboxing while chatting on<br/>
trail -<br/>
but away from finds?<br/>
