*If Spirit Kitty is imaginary, as I gathered s/he is, does he/she <br/>
count as an exchange?  I counted Max, and he's a dog, AND I didn't <br/>
even get to actually meet him.  But if I count Spirit Kitty, I should <br/>
probably then count Betz's Batik, which is a car and not even <br/>
sentient.  How many times can you split a hair, anyway?  Well, best <br/>
to err on the side of inclusion, I suppose.<br/>

Val replies:<br/>
Spirit Kitty is one cool cat. She accompanies Val and Vic on all <br/>
their letterboxing adventures and is in fact, imaginary. Her stamp, <br/>
however, is quite real. Spirit Kitty joined us after we sought <br/>
the "KJ's Best" letterbox in Mansfield, CT at the January 2001 LbNA <br/>
gathering. We found the box, bought the stamp, and ate the ice cream. <br/>
It's the "true" KJ's experience.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for recognizing Spirit Kitty, Chris. As to whether she <br/>
qualifies as a real "exchange", well, that's up to you. Did you sense <br/>
her presence there on the page???<br/>

Great time yesterday in RI!<br/>
