<br/>
Just checking in to let you know that Ovals of Cassini<br/>
and the Witch of Agnesi were doing well as of last<br/>
week, though they did seem a bit damp.  Also picked up<br/>
a hitchhiker- Palantin! :o)<br/>
<br/>
Got the Long Creek Seahorse today with my parents (who<br/>
very much enjoy this new hobby) but sadly could not<br/>
find the Broad Bay Seashell box.  It looked as though<br/>
something/one else had been there before but, look as<br/>
we might, we were unable to come up with it.  Does<br/>
anyone know the status of this box? <br/>
<br/>
 We were rewarded with a very late in the season show<br/>
put on in Broad Bay by a pod of four very playful<br/>
dolphins so the hike was a good one even though the<br/>
box was no where to be found.  And hitchhiker Palantin<br/>
is on his way ready to be found again.<br/>
<br/>
Amy :o)<br/>

&gt; Amy...I've heard from several boxers now that Broad Bay may be <br/>
missing.  It was well hidden, and my hunch is that the problem is <br/>
more with the subjective clues I wrote and how different things may <br/>
look from season to season.  I'm anxiously waiting for an opportunity <br/>
to take a day to get down to VA Beach to check on my boxes there.  If <br/>
I can find the Broad Bay box, my intention is to replant and reclue!<br/>
<br/>
Glad you enjoyed the hike...it's an interesting Park.<br/>

I suspect that we may have been looking in the wrong<br/>
place initially, but on our way back we looked at<br/>
every pine tree we could find that had some fallen<br/>
trees under it. :o) lol  My dad did a little looking<br/>
to see if it were taken by those infamous critters but<br/>
he didn't find it elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed the hike and got some nice pictures,so it<br/>
was definitely not a loss. It will be nice to try<br/>
again another time!<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

I meant to check on Broad Bay Shells a couple weeks ago but didn't <br/>
get out that trail. After reading your posts I decided I needed a <br/>
good long jog after Thanksgiving weekend. I've always wanted to do <br/>
Osprey trail from the Shore Drive entrance to the park. Fort Story <br/>
Lighthouse, Long Creek Seahorse and Broad Bay Shells were the first <br/>
Letterboxes I found over a year ago. You may still want to check for <br/>
yourself but Broad Bay Shells is not where it was 13 months ago. The <br/>
tangle of fallen trees is no longer a tangle. They're spread all over <br/>
now. Just thought you might want to know what I found.<br/>

Ok, maybe I am crazy but that's another issue for<br/>
another list. ;o)  <br/>
<br/>
It did look as though the area we were looking in had<br/>
been pretty disturbed.  I wasn't entirely sure that<br/>
was the area to look in but, given the condition, I<br/>
thought it might be there. Our thoughts turned to a<br/>
possible critter heist but unless that little bugger<br/>
carried it quite the distance we couldn't find<br/>
evidence of such a raid. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
