                    <div class="plaintext-content">I thought this got posted last nite to BOTH -usa &amp; PLB --- but <br/>
apparently I goofed.  <br/>
<br/>
While chatting with sewsowbizzy about her PLB Apologies . . . , she<br/>
asked how important the ZIP+4 was in the mailing addresses, since<br/>
only one other person had provided those extra 4 digits. I was<br/>
intrigued that folks expecting a POSTAL Letterbox would not think to<br/>
insure its speedy delivery by providing a full and complete mailing<br/>
address.<br/>
<br/>
Alas, I could not give her a specific response. But I can test the<br/>
system with a new dual PLB. That's correct, two PLB's mailed<br/>
simultaneously to each person requesting entry on to the mailing<br/>
list.<br/>
They will be named :<br/>
PLB Zip-a-dee-do-dah (with ZIP+4)<br/>
PLB Zip-a-dee-ay (with just the ZIP - 5 digit)<br/>
<br/>
The only requirement is that ALL requested entries must include the<br/>
address with ZIP+4. If you do not know yours, you can go to<br/>
www.usps.com and click on "Find a Zip Code" --- or just check your<br/>
bulk mail, it should already be in the address.<br/>
<br/>
When each box is received enter in the log book both the date it was<br/>
received and the date it is mailed on to the next recipient. Wait<br/>
until BOTH PLBs are received before mailing them both out at the same<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Each PLB will be in a Large Envelope and weigh 9oz or less so it can<br/>
be sent via FIRST CLASS MAIL - no Priority Mailings please.<br/>
www.usps.com shows a cross country run should take 3 days and cost<br/>
$2.21 per PLB (DC to CA or DC to VA, the price is the same.) But<br/>
feel free to put six - $0.37 stamps on each envelope. That is still<br/>
less than a gallon of gas in some states - and can go much further.<br/>
But I will try to make it as light and sturdy as possible, so it may<br/>
come in at under $2.21.<br/>
<br/>
This request list will be open thru July 17, 2004.<br/>

out to stamp the USA<br/>
<br/>
P.S. And so far there are 7 NE &amp; 1 TX --- we need a larger USA <br/>
sampling to make this a valid test.    <br/>
