                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have placed a letterbox and given the clues to the local EMS store and<br/>
they have made them available to anyone who asks.  I would also like<br/>
to post the clues on the Internet.  Your insturctions say to send the<br/>
clues to Letterboxing North America Talk List.  When I click on the link<br/>
to the Letterboxing North America Talk List I find an email address. I<br/>
do not curently have the clues posted on my own Web site though I could<br/>
do that.  If I want the format of my clues to be preserved what is the<br/>
best way to send the clues to LBNA?  Should I send them as an enclosure or as<br/>
ordinary text?  Must I put them on my own site to assure that the<br/>
formatting is preserved?  What happens after I submit something to<br/>
Letterboxing North America Talk List?  Does someone them post the clues<br/>
on that Web site for me?<br/>

I would appreciate any help that you can give me.<br/>

<div>Rosana,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Welcome to letterboxing. I regret your first 
LBing experience was a bit disappointing.  The letterboxing.org site 
is the clearing house of all or about 98% of all of the LBing clues in 
North America. If you don't see one in TX it's because letterboxing has not 
taken off as a hobby in your area like it has in other parts of the 
country.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We, the LbNA webmasters try very hard to keep the 
clue pages updates whenever possible. Boxers come and go in and out of the hobby 
and we have no control or many time access to information on a given box. We 
didn't want to limit LBing to people who could post and build their own site, so 
from the beginning we offered the ability of putting clues on our site.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Another point, the truth is some people also have a 
hard time with following directions, so a box really might not be missing, but 
rather just hard to find.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hiding boxes for others to find can be just as 
satisfying as finding them. Let the kids pick a subject, like a favorite cartoon 
character. You may even be able to find a commercially produced stamp 
at one of your local stores that you can use. Don't feel like you have to 
carve your own. There are a lot of other good sites with basic LBing info and 
pointers, but LbNA is where you will find most of the clues.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you hide them, they will 
come......    Box on!!!!!</div>

I just want to say that I'm sorry about what happened to Pandy and <br/>
hope that she recovers soon. I also think that this is time for us to <br/>
realize that we do need to be careful in what we say in our clues <br/>
about the terrain. I know that I've gone up some hills in the mud but <br/>
have been scared to come back down and I've had my hubby to help me. <br/>
I also realize that what might be easy to one person is hard for <br/>
someone else. I'm not the most adventurous person and have not had a <br/>
lot of experience crawling around in the woods. Also I haven't had <br/>
the best shoes on with good traction. There has to be a way to make <br/>
some boxes easy to find without a lot of hill climbing. Maybe I am <br/>
wrong and I know that I will read clues and if I think it is too hard <br/>
for me then I won't attempt to find the box. I hope that I didn't <br/>
offend anyone but I wanted to put in my opinion. <br/>

        Searched all over Eastern Ohio yesterday - found 11.<br/>
Totally exhausted today!  And elated - Big Creek Park in<br/>
Chardon was F100!  A great stamp and a nice dedication <br/>
