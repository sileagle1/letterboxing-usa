It looks like the church is expanding the cemetary because there were bulldozers, toppled trees and alot of overturned soil.  Can someone check on her and make sure she hasn't once again risen from the grave :-)<br/>

Thanks!<br/>

A couple weekends ago I got an E-mail from a fellow letterboxer <br/>
asking if I was the one who had planted the Mercy Brown and Gift to <br/>
Renee boxes. She had been out and found the Gift to Renee journal had <br/>
been filled and the waist high rock under which Mercy Brown had been <br/>
buried had been excavated to the other side of the stone wall on the <br/>
grounds. A little exploration by her, and she spotted the blue cover <br/>
of the Rubbermaid box in the dirt, and from there made arrangements <br/>
to get Mercy Brown back to me, still in great shape. I thank her for <br/>
what she's done.<br/>
My intention was to pick up the Gift to Renee box last weekend, <br/>
retire it, and plant Mercy Brown there in it's place. Instead, I <br/>
walked the trails on the other side of the road in search of a new <br/>
burial spot for Mercy. Some say the trails on the other side don't <br/>
offer much for the hiker. Soon they will. There were many places for <br/>
Mercy to finally find some peaceful sleep, except for the occasional <br/>
letterboxer, and hopefully next weekend I'll get the chance to get <br/>
her out there and the new clues posted. Also at that time, Gift to <br/>
Renee will be retired. She and I would like to thank all of you who <br/>
stopped by, and we hope you will visit Mercy Brown after she's <br/>
relocated. Watch here for the new clues.<br/>
Bob<br/>
PS Jay, Could you remove the clues to Gift to Renee and leave a note <br/>
about the Mercy Brown box being temporarily missing? and relocated?<br/>
Thanks<br/>

Thanks for the update.  I'm glad to have gotten to Renee before her "retirement."  It is a great spot.  <br/>
<br/>
Ladybug emailed me about Mercy and I look forward to visiting her in her more peaceful resting spot.<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year.<br/>
