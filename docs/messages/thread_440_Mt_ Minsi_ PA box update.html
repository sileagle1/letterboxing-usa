still on my to-do list.  I did, however, get up to Mt. Minsi this weekend.<br/>
I haven't been up to "check" on the box since I placed it.  The box has<br/>
had lots of visitors.  I was pretty surprised whan I took a look at the<br/>
visitor's log book!  I was also pretty psyched that at least one person<br/>
wrote that it was their first "hunt" and the really enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
To those who've visited, I hope you enjoyed the hike and thanks!<br/>
