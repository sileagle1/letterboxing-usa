Same goes for the MI State Parks.  This is a very delicate issue and it is currently on the books that both geocaching and letterboxing are not allowed in MI State Parks without a permit and a fee, although few parks have the resources or the inclination to enforce this.  The Michigan geocaching organization has been working very diligently with the MI DNR on this issue.  Although pressure and requests from others could have a positive impact, it could just as easily have a negative impact, losing progress that MIGO has already made. <br/>
<br/>
For the past several years, we have chosen to peacefully "co-exist" with the parks systems in MI -- for good reason -- it works this way.  If every letterboxer does their part to ensure that they are not placing boxes in eco-sensitive areas, we are in essence policing ourselves and not drawing undue attention to letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents...<br/>

That is wonderful.!!!! What amazes me is when parks don't allow for this <br/>
passive ...kinda.. activity then complain when the parks are under used!!<br/>
<br/>
I just found out recently that the Connecticut DEP has 16 boxes and if 6 are <br/>
found and documented the DEP will issue a patch.<br/>
When school is out I am planning to take my grandsons and a nephew and begin <br/>
our adventure into the woods of Connecticut. They are video kids so this will <br/>
be interesting. This is my part for the Ct program "No kid left inside"...no <br/>
grandma left inside either. LOL We are working on our team name now, gathering <br/>
our supplies and checking out maps. <br/>

I agree with one of your two cents. But I must disagree with the other<br/>
cent.<br/>
<br/>
I am all for being stealthy and waxing philosophical about the<br/>
forgiveness v permission concept. I'd rather plant thinking that I can<br/>
rather than not planting because I know I can't. I've thought about<br/>
asking permission from the various park systems and municipalities in<br/>
which I've planted, but decided not to - except for one.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to participate in our innocent activity is to be<br/>
cautious, stealthy and fly under the radar -- especially when you're<br/>
Out There. That's where I agree with you. <br/>
<br/>
As I said, I've only asked for permission once, and thankfully it has<br/>
worked out well. Which is why I have to disagree. Because for every<br/>
letterboxer who plays by the rules, goes through the motions and gets<br/>
the local and state authorities on our side and willing to let us play<br/>
our game, there is another one on the list that we can present to<br/>
those who refuse to cooperate. (FOR MORE ON THAT LIST, SEE THE<br/>
DATABASE SECTION.)<br/>
<br/>
( &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;---- OVER THERE )<br/>
<br/>
Case in point: a rather nice state park with some historical charm<br/>
here in the southeast just confiscated two letterboxes because they<br/>
"were in violation of such-and-such code regarding gaming activities".<br/>
Never mind that the part about the code indicating that the presence<br/>
of or public participation in such "illegal gaming" (good grief!) is,<br/>
according to the "code", left up to the park manager's discretion.<br/>
<br/>
I know the folks who planted those boxes, and they're the sweetest ol'<br/>
couple... and the boxes have since been retired. So even their gentle<br/>
southern charm couldn't convince the weasel -- oops, I mean manager --<br/>
to give them (and the rest of us) a break.<br/>
<br/>
Now, there is one muddy area: where the park system gets so excited<br/>
about it that it is willing to advertise it on the website. I do have<br/>
to wonder... how much traffic does a park system's website get, and,<br/>
more importantly, who is visiting? It's probably not your average<br/>
letterbox-napping hoodlums or cretins. But I'm not stoking that fire<br/>
right now... <br/>
<br/>
Let me just say (on behalf of those areas where there the<br/>
letterbox(er) population is low), it could add a couple more parties<br/>
to the mix. But here is another case where we must be careful:<br/>
somebody has to show interested parties the ropes, get faces to the<br/>
names, make sure it doesn't get out of hand. I believe that's in the<br/>
purview of the folks who initiated the formal process of requesting<br/>
permission, eh? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It's like I always say...<br/>
<br/>
"Letterboxes: our parks wouldn't be the same without them!"<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm with you on this one, Star. I think every positive encounter a <br/>
boxer has with a cooperative park manager creates one more letter that <br/>
can be used to convince an uncooperative one. I also think it helps to <br/>
have more than one person asking, instead of appointing a spokesperson <br/>
as it shows the the mgmt the true size and popularity of this hobby. <br/>
AND where one personality/voice might fail, another one might go over <br/>
better. My style may not work as best as someone else's and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
I also think it is best to start a park with historical/nature based <br/>
stamps pertaining to that area to highlight boxing as a learning <br/>
experience that creates a win-win situation for the park and the boxer. <br/>
I also learned from Alafair that it is best to ask the park to suggest <br/>
planting spots so you can avoid placing them in sensitive areas. <br/>
Another great idea is to offer a free letterboxing workshop for <br/>
families. These places are always looking for low cost programming that <br/>
fits in with their mission. I write grants for a living and deal with <br/>
this kind of thing all the time.<br/>
<br/>
And lastly, the cat is out of the bag when it comes to letterboxing. <br/>
Get over it. Articles have been written in major magazines and local <br/>
newspapers and television have covered it in all the major parts of the <br/>
country. Rather than bemoan the loss of the secrecy aspect, why not <br/>
embrace this as an opportunity to educate the masses on good <br/>
letterboxing etiquette? "La Pepe" has counseled me many times on <br/>
this...that it is good education that will see letterboxing into the <br/>
next century. And if you miss the secrecy, you can always employ WOM, <br/>
harder clues to discourage slackboxers,  a secret local society of <br/>
boxers or other devices.<br/>

  Hey LW, I've never met Mark Pepe but have seen pictures and he seems like a manly sort to me. Shouldn't it be "El Pepe"? Or do you know something about Mark that I don't....let's ask Sue!<br/>

I think that thought had crossed my mind... briefly... when<br/>
considering the 2nd annual letterboxing pow-wow... but then I thought,<br/>
I'm not an American Indian (I am a native American, as I was born<br/>
here... and that's why most American Indians prefer to be called<br/>
American Indians... that's verified through extensive research... but<br/>
I digress!)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there IS a way to make money out of letterboxing... do arts &amp;<br/>
crafts trade shows... sell letterboxing supplies... wow!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I've gone off the deep end...<br/>

&gt; Get over it. Articles have been written in major magazines and local <br/>

<br/>
Yes, the cat is out of the bag. But I can still turn around in the<br/>
checkout line at the grocery store (or, heaven forbid, Wal-Mart (hey,<br/>
I gotta get my blue-rimmed Rubbermaid somewhere!!)) and not see<br/>
somebody with an LbNa or LbSe insignia on them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ... And if you miss the secrecy, you can always employ WOM, <br/>
&gt; harder clues to discourage slackboxers,  a secret local society of <br/>
&gt; boxers or other devices.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, a secret society... like the Skulls or the Dead Poets' Society.<br/>
Sounds like a cool idea. Let's just not call it the Dead Letterbox<br/>
Society...<br/>

The game is not played the same, the perception is not the same.  If in the US, we had the support of the National Parks as they do in the UK, then perhaps it would be a different game.  But we don't and the more widespread and public the hobby becomes, the more movement there has been on the part of parks on other levels to follow the lead of the National Parks.<br/>

I am only speaking from my personal experience when I state my opinions.  I trust you are speaking from your personal experience also.  Obviously we have had different experiences in this area.  So it appears we will have to agree to disagree.<br/>
