American Discovery Trail : The nation's first coast to coast<br/>

Cape Henlopen to Maryland State Line<br/>
Upon leaving Cape Henlopen State Park you pass the Cape May/Lewes Ferry,<br/>
which crosses Delaware Bay to Cape May, New Jersey. The ADT stays on the<br/>
main road through Lewes. After a short section along busy U.S. 9, which<br/>
has a wide paved shoulder, the route follows paved country roads into<br/>
Milton. After leaving Milton, the ADT follows rural roads through<br/>
farmland. Soon after crossing U.S. 113, the trail passes through Redden<br/>
State Forest. Continuing west, the trail enters Bridgeville, The ADT<br/>
follows country roads through the unincorporated towns of Cocked Hat,<br/>
Adamsville, and Hickman before leaving Delaware on Rural Road 113, which<br/>
becomes Hobbs Road in Maryland.<br/>

Box clues may have you driving point to point. . .but the ambitious will<br/>
have bragging rights.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wish I was still as excited about it as the day I posted!  Today I <br/>
drove from DE to VA and made a point of "following" the ADT signs <br/>
where they picked up at Redden State Forest just north of Georgetown <br/>
DE.  Stopped in the office to see where in the forest the trail <br/>
went.  "It doesn't go in the forest [as on a walking trail] it is out <br/>
on the road [E Redden Rd where I had seen the ADT triangle.]"<br/>
<br/>
The long and short is that the ADT doesn't go into any DE Parks or <br/>
Forests and follows paved country roads without even the benefit of <br/>
those white lines marking Bike Routes.  In fact after Redden it <br/>
doesn't even go by a park.  But the roads had no cars for the most <br/>
part and now I have found a nice drive for when that pokey Route 404 <br/>
Beach Traffic is lined up in front of me!!!  <br/>
<br/>
But I don't know why they call it a NONmotorized recreational trail!?!<br/>
<br/>
And the worse part is, I didn't even see any good spots for a <br/>
letterbox plant.<br/>
<br/>
Next trip I'll validate the Cape Henlopen Park to Redden State Forest <br/>
roads.  There is no DE ADT trail map - except the one I just printed <br/>
and taped together from Mappoint.msn.com segments.<br/>
<br/>
I'll update this post later in the month (of July)<br/>
