<br/>
Over the last week, I found myself, for various<br/>
reasons, in both central NY and central VT. Not one to<br/>
pass on opportunity, a few new stamps found their way<br/>
into our logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Finch Hollow, Johnson City, NY: Very fast hike. The<br/>
trailhead mapboard is deceiving. Found this one fast.<br/>
Also took this as an opportunity to take someone out<br/>
boxing for the first time. Hopefully, she will take to<br/>
it. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The Dispatcher, Vestal, NY: Fantastic hike through the<br/>
woods just off of a rail trail. This one was<br/>
definitely worth the drive!<br/>
<br/>
Vermont Tree, Guilford, VT: Nice and quick. Got to<br/>
love being able to stop at a rest area and get a<br/>
stamp. Just missed a HH, too. ::sigh:: Might have to<br/>
copy this idea.....<br/>
<br/>
Vermont Loon, Hartford, VT: See above comment, except<br/>
no HH. Was really hoping that the folks had moved that<br/>
first one up the highway a few miles to this box, but<br/>
no such luck.<br/>
<br/>
The Vermont Flower, Hartford, VT: This is one of the<br/>
prettiest stamps we've seen in a good while. And, as a<br/>
special treat, Legerdemaine had been here previously,<br/>
so we got to see a personal stamp I'd been hoping to<br/>
run across for quite some time. <br/>

.....and who hopes we can hook up with the Turtle<br/>
sometime soon....<br/>
