<div>Rating: Moderate</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Time 1 1/2 - 2 hours for both</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Some rocky terrain</div>

<div>   To find Shelter Falls Park, Mansfield  take 
rte 44 between  rte 32 and rte 195 Off of  rte 44 turn onto Hunting 
Lodge road. Pass the elementary school  to the stop sign. At this 
intersection go straight onto Birch Rd. The park will be on your left a little 
way down.  </div>
<div>   Enter the trail at the sign and garbage 
can.  You will see why this peice of land was preserved. This small brook 
and the incredible stone should be saved as a place for families to roam.  
First cross a simple bridge then one more complex. Look upstream at the rocks 
and falls they are beautiful. Onward now your quest has begun. The trail climbs 
up to an intersection.</div>
<div>   Here where you have a choice in white go right. 
Along this trail up and down  look on the right for the UCONN Forest marker 
to be found. Along the stream ,then to rocky crossings from here to the Billy 
Goat trail, up and slippery on the bed of wet leaves.  Along the side of 
the slope the trail goes, the Brook is pretty here just below.</div>
<div>   They came  with saws and cleared the trail 
twice here to make it easier for you, the  pieces of tree lay bisected by 
the trail.</div>
<div>When you reach a stand of Hemlock and Laurel no matter the 
season the color is green. From here you are now on the Billy Goat trail. 
Scramble up. It's not marked as such but reminds me of the one in the story 
Heidi.  So up you climb huff and Puff.  Once again the parks crew 
sawed 2 trees on the trail pass on through.  </div>
<div>   On you go til you reach a stone wall. With your 
left foot now count off 12 paces up the trail. STOP , turn left see the Hemlock 
go up to that tree</div>
<div>  Turn left now take 10 paces , left, left left.... to 
the dead tree . It lays as it fell pointing to the trail  in the piece 
where it broke you will find your quest. Stamp it in secret  and place back 
as  you found it.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now return to the trail, go back the way you came when you 
come to the intersection of the white arrow  take the right. </div>
<div>  On the trail through tall clear woods to a simple 
clearing  with the stream to the left. Around a log in the path and on you 
go.  At the fork in the path make your choice to go right . </div>
<div>    Soon enough you will see a large knoll on 
the left , between you and the stream. Here you will  hear cars traveling 
by on a road to the left.</div>
<div>   Stay with the white dots as you walk along here, 
til you come to a stonewall on your left. ( the road ahead is Hunting 
Lodge)  follow the stone wall  looking for a piece of Rose Quartz near 
to large stones that rise up out of the wall . You will find the Shelter Falls 
Box   just behind and below.  Stamp quiet and quick and place as 
you found, the next hikers will want to find it themselves.  Back on the 
trail go as you came when you reach the intersection with white arrow, go right 
that takes you back to the car, stop again and enjoy the falls before you go. 
Have Fun and be Safe. </div>
