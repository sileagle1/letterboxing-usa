&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am from MA, I just joined this mailing list this morning after stumbling<br/>
&gt; across the letterbox site this morning. I never heard of it and I was<br/>
&gt; instantly hooked, I went to look for the one at Fort Taber in New Bedford<br/>
&gt; but couldn't find it, I thought my Boy Scout Orienteering skills would<br/>
&gt; have succeed this afternoon but its been seven years since I did something<br/>
&gt; like this. Anyways its alot of fun and I can't wait to look for more, I am<br/>
&gt; glad to see there are 5 in my hometown to go look for on break from<br/>
&gt; college.<br/>
