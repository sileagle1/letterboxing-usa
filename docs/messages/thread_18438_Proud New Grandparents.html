We just wanted to tell everyone that we are new proud<br/>
Grandparents. Our Grandson was born today at 7:13pm.<br/>
He was 19 inches long and 5 lbs 15 oz. His name is<br/>
Ben. Sorry we just had to tell everyone.He is our<br/>
first Grandchild.<br/>
<br/>
We also are moving to our New house next week. Boy no<br/>
letter boxing for us for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Take care all.<br/>

We started Letterboxing on 8/29/2003 and fell in love with it. Now we are hooked.<br/>
