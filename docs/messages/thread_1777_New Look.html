                    <div class="plaintext-content">As many have noticed, the webmasters are working on an update to the <br/>
LBNA website. The first hints have been a different organization of <br/>
boxes in VT, VA, PA, FL, and some others. We're trying to make our <br/>
jobs a little easier as letterboxing grows as well as give the site a <br/>
fresher look. We hope to have some real eye candy for you soon.<br/>
<br/>
As the southern new england webmaster I've been a little slow in <br/>
keeping up with my more adept colleagues. Finally, I put up the newer <br/>
format tonight. You'll see a slight difference from the other new <br/>
pages but we should have things tweaked and more uniform for you soon.<br/>
<br/>
If you would, please take a look for your letterboxes and let me know <br/>
if I've lost any in the shuffle.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and happy hunting,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Jay, two things about the Rhode Island boxes. First, The Ghost Town <br/>
at Sundown is actually in South Kingstown. The second thing is that <br/>
since the authorities have closed down the old Jamestown Bridge, <br/>
maybe it's time to delete those clues completely. Perhaps one day we <br/>
can replace it with one in the new Jamestown park, at the end of <br/>
Battery Lane. The town and volunteers spent a lot of time clearing <br/>
brush and cutting paths so visitors to the park could better view the <br/>
Bunkers there. This park is located off of Beavertail Road and a box <br/>
there would give folks a chance to get three stamps, starting with <br/>
Ft. Getty,  then the new Battery Lane box, and ending with Beavertail <br/>
Light. After that they'd still have time to do Ft. Wetheril and <br/>
Island Sanctuary for a total of 5 stamps in one afternoon. I'll work <br/>
on the box for Battery Park, unless you'd like to give it a try and <br/>
keep all the Island boxes under Drewclan ownership.<br/>
Like the new look, keep up the good work.<br/>

    I love the new look!  It's so easy to find boxes in the same town now!<br/>
I think the only box I noticed that may have been lost in the shuffle is<br/>
Rock Springs Wildlife Refuge in Scotland.  Keep up the great work on the<br/>
site.<br/>

Oh, I'm not sure who checked on your Mystic box, but it wasn't us this time.<br/>

The new So. NE site looks great.  I have a couple of requests, <br/>
though.  Since RI is the smallest state we try to spell every <br/>
variation of the same name differently just to throw people off.  <br/>
There is a Kingston, RI (where URI is) but it actually isn't a town <br/>
in it's own right.  It is part of South Kingstown with a 'w.'  North <br/>
Kingstown also has a 'w.'  <br/>
<br/>
Also, would it be possible to have the Providence boxes listed in <br/>
their actual towns.  I realized that I had lived here too long when <br/>
it never dawned on me to look for the clues to Parker Woodlands <br/>
(Thing to do with Stone) under Providence.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
