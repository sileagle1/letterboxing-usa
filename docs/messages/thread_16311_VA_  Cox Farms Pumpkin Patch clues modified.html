                    <div class="plaintext-content">While checking on my plant today (no finders yet), I came across a group <br/>
of searchers.  They did great until they were nearly on top of the spot <br/>
and then it took an hour or so, with hints.  The endgame was not <br/>
supposed to be that tough.  They had some good suggestions for <br/>
clarifying certain clues.  I have therefore updated the box's clue page...<br/>
