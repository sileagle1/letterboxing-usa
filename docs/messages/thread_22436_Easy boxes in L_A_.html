<br/>
I'll be in L.A. for a 4 day conference from Sunday 21st (evening) until<br/>
Friday 26th morning with some play time in between.  Can anyone suggest<br/>
boxes that are easy to get to?  Should we rent a car?  Is there decent<br/>
public transportation?  We'll be staying on far east end of Wilshire<br/>
Blvd near the Conference Center.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  If anyone wants to get<br/>
together, We'd LOVE to meet some West Coasters!<br/>

There's a whole bunch of boxes in Griffith Park, which is on the north<br/>
side of Hollywood. Trekking around the park trying to find those is a<br/>
good day's adventure. Public transportation is pretty good--subway and<br/>
bus are both fairly reliable and regularly scheduled, a $3 day pass is<br/>
your best bet, though really you might want to rent a car if you're<br/>
going to do the Griffith Park boxes because the park itself is so vast<br/>
I wound up driving from site to site, then doing the separate hikes<br/>
for each box. You could get *to* the park on pub-trans, but getting<br/>
*around* it is another story.<br/>
<br/>
I can't speak to other boxes in LA because i moved away before i could<br/>
hunt for any others elsewhere in the area. (Hence, i wouldn't be able<br/>
to meet up either, but good luck and have fun!)<br/>
