Silly Ol' Bear and I were at Fort Mountain, GA, this weekend to do <br/>
some camping, planting, and to meet up with Mark (ndnboxing) for an <br/>
exchange. We discussed this very topic with Mark earlier on the same <br/>
day you posted your thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
There are very few regular GA boxers, right now. Not really enough <br/>
for a major gathering. Our plan was to watch for posts from out of <br/>
state boxers who were planning trips to the Atlanta area, then <br/>
schedule an event for that weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Stone Mountain has 9 boxes currently planted there. It's a popular <br/>
destination for visitors to GA. Our thoughts were that it would be <br/>
ideal for a gathering. It's still very much in the planning stages, <br/>
little more than an idea for now. Keep us in mind if you pursue this <br/>
any further, and we could probably help each other.<br/>
<br/>
As for a new yahoo talk group for the southeast states, I'd <br/>
subscribe. You could include TN and AL as well.<br/>
