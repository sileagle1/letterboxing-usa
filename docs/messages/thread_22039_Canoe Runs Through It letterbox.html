                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got back from a mini vaca in the Tampa, FL area.  My friend and <br/>
I attempted most of the boxes in that area (unfortunately we were only <br/>
able to find 3...with a VERY close 4th)  But my all time favorite in <br/>
that area was the Canoe Runs Through it box.  If you live in that area <br/>
or ever visit there or close by, I HIGHLY recommend it.  If you do <br/>
attempt it, plan on about 2 hours round trip.  While the clues said 30-<br/>
45 mintues for the canoe ride downstream...my friend and I took about <br/>
an hour.  The scenery was absolutely amazing!  We definitely took our <br/>
time on this nice, peaceful canoe ride.  My friend has lived in the <br/>
area for about 10 months and she said if it was not for me and <br/>
letterboxing she probably would have never seen "that side to FL"<br/>
<br/>
I give this box 2 thumbs up and 5 stars.  Great job to Tony &amp; Nikki!!<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking of where in CT to attempt a box like that.  I"ll have to <br/>
borrow my dad's canoe and start exploring all the different CT <br/>
rivers.  lol<br/>
