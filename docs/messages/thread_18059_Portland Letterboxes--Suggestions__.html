<br/>
Kerblammo and I are going to be traveling to Portland, OR the first <br/>
weekend in Aril and will have one day to do some letterboxing in <br/>
areas we can reach without a car.  We are going to be staying <br/>
downtown and have a great capacity for walking and riding the light <br/>
rail.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of the Powell's Bookstore Letterbox, can you make any <br/>
suggestions on boxes we might be able to take in in this short time-<br/>
period?  I'd love to get ot Hoyt Arboretum, but I'm not sure how far <br/>
away or accessible it really is from downtown.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your thoughts,<br/>
<br/>

station. There are a bunch of boxes in the zoo/arboretum/Washington <br/>
park area and is a great place to hike around. The arboretum main <br/>
building has trail maps for sale for cheap. 10 cents I think. Don't <br/>
forget mystery boxes. :)<br/>

<br/>
I think I heard rumors that the Powell's Bookstore letterbox might be <br/>
missing.  I'm not positive on that, but it might be worth double-<br/>
checking before you head out.<br/>
<br/>
A good stop on the light rail where there are five letterboxes for <br/>
the pluking is the Tualitan Hills Nature Park.  The clues to a couple <br/>
had to be changed and I'm not sure if they've been updated or not, so <br/>
that's another one you'll want to do double-check before heading <br/>
out.  (The last three of the series are missing, but the first five, <br/>
at last check, are still doing well!)<br/>
<br/>
The zoo stop has tons of letterboxes it seems.  If you like hiking, <br/>
you can actually hike all the way out to Pittock Mansion where there <br/>
are a few boxes.  (Halloween series, right?  I haven't gotten those <br/>
yet myself.  *sigh*)<br/>
<br/>
There also seems to be a surprisingly large number of boxes along the <br/>
waterfront in downtown Portland.  <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm....  Those are the only ones I can think of easily accessible <br/>
from MAX.  If you can let letterboxing go for an afternoon, a quick <br/>
drive through the Columbia River Gorge is spectacular.  Makes the <br/>
Grand Canyon look like nothing more than a big hole in the ground, if <br/>
you ask me.  =)  (And there ARE letterboxes out there that don't even <br/>
take much effort to get.  Just getting out there would be the hard <br/>
part without a car, but oh, it's so worth it!)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I'd love to get ot Hoyt Arboretum, but I'm not sure how far <br/>
&gt; away or accessible it really is from downtown.<br/>
<br/>
That's the zoo stop.  Very accessible.  Probably wouldn't even take <br/>
more than 15 minutes to get to riding MAX from downtown.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Unfortunately Ryan is correct and I Iron`Bear and I just haven't <br/>
gotten around to replacing this box as of yet.  The box has gone <br/>
missing three times and Powell's doesn't want it inside their <br/>
bookstore, so until I come up with some other wonderful I idea on <br/>
where to or how to hide it the box is MIA<br/>
<br/>
However, I would recommend the Turtle Soup letterbox while you are <br/>
downtown, just be sure to figure out the clues way in advance! But <br/>
it's a wonderful box for sure.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Zoo area, if you can get there, my Fate of Childhood <br/>
letterbox series is there also, and adventure #1 will be right under <br/>
your nose.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and I hope you enjoy boxing in Oregon!<br/>
