that is in danger of being turned into a driving range and restraunt.  <br/>
It happens to be a point of debate in the city of Norwalk.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you will all get to do this very easy letterbox.  If you enjoy <br/>
the area ... and would not like to see it detroyed ... I would ask that <br/>
you write to the address included on the web page to voice your <br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE:  Birdwatchers ... BRING BINOCULARS!!!!  There is a family of Red- <br/>
Tailed Hawks who call this preserve their home.  Though the box will <br/>
take 10 minutes to do.  I spent 1.5 hours sitting and observing the <br/>
hawks, woodpeckers, mallards, etc.<br/>
