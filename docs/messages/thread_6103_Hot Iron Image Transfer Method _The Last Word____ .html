<p>April of Stampeaz here in CT, a stamp carver extraordinaire, was kind enough to share her method of transfering images to stamp medium. I have her permission to quote and she asked that I recognize her company (<a href="http://www.investorsnet.com/stampeaz/">http://www.investorsnet.com/stampeaz/</a>) and great service in return. </p>
<p>This method seems to solve the problems of smudging and using solvents.</p>
<p>"What I think is the absolute BEST way to transfer <br/>xerox/carbon/laser  designs onto rubber or my PZKut<br/>is by using a med/hot iron!<br/><br/>Put the design, with a good amount of paper border around it to <br/>protect the rubber from direct heat, face down on the PZKut.<br/>Press the hot iron onto the design and move the iron around so it <br/>gets all of the design.  Do not keep in one place.<br/>The heat will also `tac' the paper in place so you don't have to tape <br/>it <br/>or worry about it moving and smudging.<br/>As it starts to transfer you can lift up a corner here and there to see <br/>how it is doing. Some places may need more pressure and heat.<br/>The paper won't move unless you lift the whole piece up.<br/>The transfer should be a dark black.<br/>Sometimes you may get 90% black and a spot will be gray, go back <br/>to that area with more heat and also pressure.<br/>The ironing board should be flat. If it is not flat put cardboard, <br/>phone <br/>book or something to get it flat.<br/><br/>Try it and let me know how it works out. It is absolutely incredible <br/>how crisp the transfer is. : ) "</p>
