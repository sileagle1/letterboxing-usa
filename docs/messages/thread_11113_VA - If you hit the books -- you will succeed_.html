<div>There was no way I was going to leave Bull Run Regional Library with out the Letterbox Book Box.  No way!  Despite pangs of hunger (thanks to Road to Enlightenment #3) and really having to go to the bathroom (thanks to too much Coke this morning) I was going to find it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The catalog keyboard was smokin'!  I must have looked up over a dozen Dewey decimals... But, just when I was about to give up hope (I guess it works just like it does before you meet the man/woman you're destined to marry...) I tried for o...n.....e   m....o.....r.....e shelf.  And, amazing, astounding (key -  swelling music) I found it!!!  What a cool box!  Truly a work of art!  It was worth ALL the searching.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And, amazing, astounding (key - crashing cymbals) BeMa was the first one!!  At least I think so.  I kept checking and checking to see other stamps!  I think I was a bit shaky at this point (and I had this funny twitching thing going on....).  I tried to emulate the wild and carefully thought out color selection of the younger BeMa's when I stamped them in (their stamps represent the team and I was the sole member not studying or working to earn a living).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Keep trying anyone who is searching for this box.  It is very well done!  BeMa</div>
