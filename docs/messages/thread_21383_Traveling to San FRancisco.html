I think some of the best boxes that I have done have been vandalized  <br/>
(Nepenthe and Vertigo 1).  But definitely Check out Starkissed.  there <br/>
was a Gathering in Golden Gate park in July 2004 so lots of boxes <br/>
there.  Anything that ryhmes with "left me heart"...so cart, dart, <br/>
tart boxes.  The Conservatory of flowers, Buffalo Raom, Carousels Pink <br/>
Treat, Summer of Love, Chorazin's Lofe, Playland Lives all are in the <br/>
park. Probably more I am forgetting too. These are teh boxes I have <br/>
personal experince with oh yes and Tara's SF Landmark series although <br/>
1 of the 3 boxes in missing.  <br/>
<br/>
Will you ahve a car or be using public transport?  There are some <br/>
boxes I haven't made yet but am dying to play hooky and go find.  <br/>
Chiefly Greener Pastures and Land's End Series. Both are near <br/>
culturral attractions that IMHO are worth visiting as well.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, feel free to contact me off list.<br/>
