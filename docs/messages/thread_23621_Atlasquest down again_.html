work.  Last night, everything worked fine, and all of my other <br/>
websites work fine.<br/>

I wonder if Ryan does automatic upgrades early in the AM?  (at 3 a.m. <br/>
perhaps, which would be 6 a.m. here on the East Coast?)<br/>

<br/>
No, they aren't automatic, but I typically do 'intrusive' stuff late<br/>
at night (after midnight, Pacific time) to help reduce the chance of<br/>
annoying people. =)<br/>
<br/>
I actually fell asleep at the computer at around 2 a.m. and just in<br/>
time for things to go wrong and not have me at the wheel to fix it<br/>
when it did. I was trying to upgrade some software (actually started<br/>
at 10:30 in the evening) and did *not* expect it to take near as long<br/>
as it did, and I just plum fell asleep by two A.M.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about that. In any case, I think everything is working now,<br/>
though admitted I haven't tested it a great deal just yet. On the plus<br/>
side, I have no more of those 'intrusive' updates on my list anymore,<br/>
so I hope that's the last of the problems you'll see for some time to<br/>
come. =)<br/>

reported to me and everything seems to be running fine at this point,<br/>

over the next couple of days and when they do, I'll stomp them flat. =)<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, though, AQ seems to be acting its normal reliable<br/>
self and there are no *known* problems with it at this point. (What?<br/>
Is that someone knocking on wood?)<br/>
<br/>
Like I said before, this is the last of the intrusive updates I had<br/>
planned on doing so there shouldn't be any downtime in the future.<br/>
Just the occasional bug fixes that need fixing.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>
