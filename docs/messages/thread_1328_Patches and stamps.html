<br/>
For my stamps I usually draw or trace an image onto a piece of paper with a soft leaded pencil #2 works fine and then turn it over onto the stamp and rub the back of the paper with the side of the pencil and the images transfers to the stamp and I use the linolium block tools to carve the stamp. It works really well and you can wash off the carbon that you didn't carve off and the ink covers it up when you first stamp it out.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>
