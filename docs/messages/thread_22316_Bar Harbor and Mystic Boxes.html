It's kind of funny to be reading your e-mail now, as I'm supposed to be getting ready to leave tomorrow morning to go back home to Connecticut from the Chicago area, where we did some of YOUR boxes.  (I told my parents that we would only come for a visit this year if we could go letterboxing every day, and warned them that I would make them box 'til they dropped.  They did).  Although we live in eastern Ct., we haven't done many boxes in the Mystic area yet-there are alot of boxes in Ct. and we've been doing this for less than a year.  There are a ton of boxes in Rocky Neck state park in East Lyme, there is one in Lyme called She Sells Seashells, which is a drive-up but there is a very good reason to do that one, in my opinion.  I have to put in a plug for one of my series, Pride and Prejudice in Waterford.  We've also really enjoyed Book Barn and Relax and Read in Niantic.  I don't know what you consider "in the area", though, but Ct. is a small state-we have a different<br/>
 perspective.  By the way, when you get home, we have placed a mystery box here while on our visit-check it out.  We enjoyed your boxes, and still have some to check out next year, by which time my parents should have recovered from this visit.  Enjoy your trip,<br/>

I guess it's bad form to tout your own box, but I planted my Make Way<br/>
for Ducklings box on Mount Desert Island because it was one of my<br/>
favorite hikes in the world.  Even if you don't go after the box, it's<br/>
a wonderful place to visit.<br/>
