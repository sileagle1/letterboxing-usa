This should be an easy box to locate.  You must first locate Fort<br/>
Morgan in Alabama.  There is a ferry landing a short distance from the<br/>
fort.  From the landing, look for a nearby area with cement picnic<br/>
tables.     Find the row of concrete pillars keeping the traffic out<br/>
of the picnic area.  Make your way to the pillar furthest from the<br/>
ferry landing.  Your treasure is located at the base of the nearest<br/>
pine tree.  Please cover it well when you are done.  <br/>
<br/>
Note:  Digging is NOT required.<br/>
<br/>
2nd Note:<br/>
I didn't have any letterboxing info sheets with me when I planted this<br/>
box.  It will likely be an orphan.  If anyone would care to drop a few<br/>
info sheets in it, or adopt it, feel free.<br/>
