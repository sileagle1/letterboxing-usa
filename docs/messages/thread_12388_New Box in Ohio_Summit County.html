                    <div class="plaintext-content">Placed by the Five Pedaling Rink Rats: Summit County, near Peninsula, on the Towpath Trail Planted April 20, 2003 Difficulty: Easy. From Peninsula, go south about 3/4 mile to Deep Lock (#28).  As you face the lock, look for a trail to the left leading up the hill.   Go up the hill. Walk up to the first major intersection of trails.  You will see a sign which reads "To Towpath Trail and Deep Lock 28", and it will point to the way you came from.  From the sign, turn right and immediately left.  Watch for a trail marker on the right, then a large rock on the right.  Keep walking.  Look for a large rock on the left.  Stop. Face the rock (this will be generally east, back down toward the Towpath Trail and Lock 28.)  Walk forward over the rock into the woods approx. 40 paces.  Look for iron poles (wonder what they were for?) sticking out of the ground.  Look for a 6 foot long concrete block with a broken tree over it.  Parallel to the block lies a big log.  The box is at the midpoint under the big log, under a rock.   If you find our box and wish to write us, do so at tlskates1@yahoo.com<br/>

this summer and have been bemoaning the lack of boxes near my parents' home <br/>
(Stow, Ohio, to be more precise).  You Five Rink Rats are making me very <br/>
happy!!  I've been intending to leave a box or two behind--now I have hope <br/>
that someone will actually seek them out if I do! <br/>
