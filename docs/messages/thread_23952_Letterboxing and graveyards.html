I love cemeteries, and their history, and in my particular case I was<br/>
proud of my ancestor and wanted to share his history. I don't personally<br/>
consider letterboxing to be "playing a game." I was drawn to it because it<br/>
got me out and visiting places that I wouldn't normally do. For instance,<br/>
when I found a letterbox at the Andover Historical Society we went to the<br/>
museum, same with the National Plastics Museum in Leominster. When we go<br/>
on hikes in conservation areas we go to places that interest us, and do<br/>
the climbs etc. Letterboxing is the vehicle that got us there, not the end<br/>
in itself.<br/>

<br/>
I didn't post on your blog, but have a comment.  My dad loved many <br/>
games and hobbies and if he were buried in a cemetery it would be the <br/>
perfect thing to have a letterbox near him.  (Instead I dedicated a <br/>
disc golf hole(?) in his memory.)  I just wanted to let you know that <br/>
some people love and honor their relatives not by somber silence and <br/>
reflection, but by continuing on with things their relatives enjoyed.  <br/>

P.S.  In the past, I've read on some message boards that several <br/>
currently living boxers would like to have a box near their grave after <br/>
they are gone. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">To me, having lbing in cemetaries is absolutely wonderful.  We are not<br/>
parading a gang of vandals through these places.  Just as we are caring of<br/>
our surroundings when we are walking through a national park, or a historic<br/>
site, or our local playground.<br/>
<br/>
I have found many lbs in cemetaries.  My experience, and my mother's and my<br/>
preschooler's and my husband's has been that of learning, respect, adoration<br/>
of beautiful art, appreciation for the history and a sense of the "bigness"<br/>
of death.  We don't trod around with big Sasquash feet, pounding down head<br/>
stones, laughing our heads off and making fun of mourners.<br/>
<br/>
I am actually quite hurt that you view letterboxers as a gang of game<br/>
players who would revel in cemetaries.<br/>
<br/>
How many people visit cemetaries?  Very few.  They are MEANT to be visited,<br/>
in my opinion.  Should we just stick our dead in fields and forget them?<br/>
And not try to understand cemetaries?  They are a part of life as any other<br/>
place is.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxers enjoy visiting new places, having new experiences, learning.<br/>
This is a wonderful, respectful way to get people into cemetaries.  To give<br/>
them the experience.  To teach them what there is to learn there.<br/>
<br/>
Using headstones as clues is an incredible way to get people to examine what<br/>
is on headstones.  What words, what kind of lives, what artwork.  What a<br/>
learning experience!  Our letterboxing has led us to Veteran's cemetaries,<br/>
to active church yards, to historical old places all but forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
I understand your desire for reverence.  I don't think we are trodding on<br/>
that.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I felt somewhat like you do for a long, long time.  I would go and find<br/>
cemetery boxes, but I was uneasy with the appropriateness of them.<br/>
<br/>
After visiting several good cemetery boxes, I suddenly realized I was<br/>
looking forward to the next one.  I thoroughly enjoy roaming cemeteries,<br/>
seeing the past of the community I'm visiting and being shown interesting<br/>
people who might never have been known had it not been for that box.  It's a<br/>
way of immortalizing ordinary folk.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, it changed my view on visiting my own father's grave - I rarely<br/>
visited his grave because I could hardly bear the sadness of reading his<br/>
name.  I've come to think of him now as a member of the community past, the<br/>
roots of the community I am raising my kids in.  I found that my kids enjoy<br/>
visiting him there, and my husband and I tell them stories about him and all<br/>
the people buried around him.  I never realized, until I started frequenting<br/>
cemeteries while letterboxing, how people are buried in much the same<br/>
pattern and era they died in, so that with the help of a few stories you can<br/>
almost see those folks as they were living.<br/>
<br/>
Now I do agree that it is entirely possible for people to be disrespectful<br/>
in cemeteries and I have taught my kids ot be watchful of mourners and to<br/>
avoid invading their privacy.  Sometimes boxers write clues that don't<br/>
regard the graves - possibly leading finders over graves or through the<br/>
cemetery gratuitously, and that's not cool either.<br/>
<br/>
I think the box that turned the corner for me was a tribute box to Blind<br/>
Lemon Jefferson, a musician of an era-gone-by, buried in a remote<br/>
little negro cemetery in a small town in Texas.  In the course of a half<br/>
hour, I learned an amazing amount of information about burial customs in my<br/>
own region and about a man who had been known in his time as a legend, and<br/>
you have to wonder how someone of such greatness wound up buried in such an<br/>
obscure manner.  But people haven't forgotten him, they go and pay tribute<br/>
to him with guitar picks and pocket change - and a letterbox.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Keep in mind that cemetery etiquette or activities have changed thru the<br/>
years also.  In decades and centuries past, things like celebrations,<br/>
picnics, birthday parties, etc. were often held in cemeteries.  And in some<br/>
cultures and with many families, they still are.  We throw a huuuuuuuuuuge<br/>
Irish birthday party at my grandmother's gravesite every year.<br/>
<br/>
People learn history in cemeteries.  People learn art in cemeteries.  I<br/>
learned to walk in a cemetery.  We lived right next to Graceland Cemetery in<br/>
Chicago when I was born -- an absolutely fantastic cemetery -- and I learned<br/>
to walk by tottering from stone to stone, using the stones for balance.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, I have a box planted in a cemetery IN part of a headstone.  Completely<br/>
with the family's approval.  In fact, they suggested the idea.  I would<br/>
never ever have considered doing it otherwise.   Their father, when he<br/>
passed away, wanted visitors to his gravesite, and he also loved to play<br/>
games.  Tho he wasn't a letterboxer.  His particular drugs of choice were<br/>
parcheesi and spoons.  This way he has someone playing a game and visiting<br/>
him at the same time.  And if someone should happen to bring a fiddle, I'm<br/>
sure he'd come on down and dance. :-)<br/>
<br/>
To me, ground can be sacred without having to be a dirge.  Kind of like<br/>
churches.  There are some folks that absolutely have to have everything<br/>
somber or it's not "religious" to them.  There are other congregations that<br/>
break loose in a celebration of song and dance that can probably be heard<br/>
from Los Angeles to New York City.   But one's not any less respectful than<br/>
the other in my eyes.<br/>

that it was time to add my two cents worth. I live in Ct and there are <br/>
alot of graveyards here rich with history. I took the family out <br/>
(Wife's not from around here) and they were amazed to see some of the <br/>
stones. We had done a search called the Patriot that actually had us <br/>
stop at Benedict Arnolds's mothers grave. There was also another one <br/>
that had us pass the civil war memorials of six soldiers that died in <br/>
Andersonville. I think that as long as no damage is done there's alot <br/>
to learn from these areas. People put up stones so that others will <br/>
never forget<br/>

<br/>
There is one caveat to remember though before you plant in a <br/>
graveyard. In some areas it may be illegal to plant letterboxes and <br/>
geocaches in graveyards. I believe I read recently that Tennessee is <br/>
one state where this is so.<br/>

the first day we went<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was leery of adding to this topic, due to recent posts that seemed <br/>
to point a negative finger at family letterboexers with young <br/>
children. My one experience to date was quite negative. Then <br/>
yesterday, at a different cemetary, it happened again. What is WITH <br/>
these people???? Does giving birth suddenly remove an adult's sense of <br/>
decorum and respect for other people? Or is it just people in THIS <br/>
area? that I encounter? I am astounded.<br/>
<br/>
The first time I looked for a box in a cemetary was last week. I <br/>
wanted to take my 10 yr old goddaughter out to look for a box for the <br/>
first time. It was cold and gray so I picked 2 indoor boxes. But she <br/>
wanted to look for one outdoors. I had printed off several boxes that <br/>
were near to her home and she wanted to do this one:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=11774<br/>
<br/>
As you can see it is a very intriguing story, all about a tragic <br/>
accident involving a circus train almost 100 years ago, and the <br/>
cemetary is the site of the burial of these circus performers. When we <br/>
went to the cemetary I impressed upon her in the car that letterboxing <br/>
needs to be kept secret, so that the cemetary staff do not find the <br/>
box and remove it, and if anyone was curious we needed to LIE and say <br/>
she was doing a school project. :-)<br/>
<br/>
When we got to the cemetary, she was VERY excited to see the elephant <br/>
staues from the car just as the clues said we would. As we got out of <br/>
the car, her natural exuberance came to the fore and I really needed <br/>
to keep a grip on her. I kept reminding her that this was the site of <br/>
peoples' GRAVES, people who had died tragically, people who were <br/>
buried name unknown. We could not walk across their headstones, yell <br/>
and shout, run around, or treat the place like a playground. Yes were <br/>
were there to do something "fun" but we needed to keep respect for the <br/>
dead at the front of our intentions at all times. It was hard for her, <br/>
and sometimes she forgot herself, but she tried as best she could  <br/>
(she's a good girl; plus she knows if she ticks me off there will be <br/>
no further outings with Fun Auntie M, so that is good leverage for <br/>
me :-))<br/>
<br/>
As we were walking around [it's a rather small area of the cemetary] <br/>
an SUV pulled up. We were immediately on alert, bc what were the <br/>
chances of some other folks coming to that exact place at 4:30 on a <br/>
cold and windy Nov day, just 30 min before dark? Out came a family -- <br/>
a mother, a father smoking a stinky cigar, and 2 loud boys, one about <br/>
8-9, one about 4-5. The 2 boys immediately came running to the circus <br/>
area where we were, were yelling and running over graves. The mother <br/>
was loudly pointing out the exact same gravestones as listed in "the <br/>
story" that we had just seen ourselves, which is why I thought they <br/>
were letterboxers. None of them made any attempt ot be discreet in <br/>
case we were there as mounrners or for any other reason. My <br/>
goddaughter and I just kept on quietly with what we were doing, bc we <br/>
did not want to fid the box at the same time they did.<br/>
<br/>
What reallllllllyyy offended me was that, as we were leaving that area <br/>
and making our way to the next part of the clues [in a non-circus part <br/>
of the cemetary], the youngest boy climbed up onto one of the elephant <br/>
staues -- which as "the story" specified, had their trunks lowered "in <br/>
mourning" -- and started whooping and yee hawing, and waving his arm <br/>
over his head, and yelling for his parents to "Look! LOOOOK!" bc he <br/>
was "a cowboy." They looked on in indulgent amusement and then the <br/>
mother said yes, yes very nice, a cowboy, and called him over to the <br/>
car and they finally drove off.<br/>
<br/>
My goddaughter and I talked about this as we were walking thru the <br/>
cemetary and following the other clues. I told her how offensive I <br/>
found their behavior. No child is perfect of course -- my goddaughter <br/>
badly wanted a picture of her with Ellie, the largest elephant statue, <br/>
and she did climb up to stand beside Ellie, but I told her sharply to <br/>
get down. I honestly don't know how parents raise well behaved <br/>
children when the kids are constantly shown examples of other kids <br/>
behaving badly, and their parents encouraging it.<br/>
<br/>
So that was just the one incident. Though we looked and looked for the <br/>
box, we did not ever find it, so I don't know if they found it forst, <br/>
and signed it and who they were.<br/>
<br/>
But then yesterday. Another one. A box hidden at another cemetary, a <br/>
good 40 miles away from that one. I went to this one alone. As I was <br/>
walking thu the cemetary following the clues, a mini van pulled up, 4 <br/>
doors opened all at once and vomited out a huge loud family. AND. <br/>
THEIR. DOG.<br/>
<br/>
Ok I don't mean to seem stuffy. BUT A DOG. This is not a dog park! <br/>
This is a cemetary! You see someone walking in the cemetary and you <br/>
let YOUR DOG out to follow you around and pee on the graves?!?!? It <br/>
was a very very cute dog. Quite adorable. Followed them around very <br/>
obediently. But still. Wrong wrong wrong. The youngest was climbing up <br/>
on top of bigger gravestones. The mother was reading sloud the clues <br/>
so loudly I could hear her all the way across the place. They were of <br/>
course, following me, and I did not care ot let on where the box was. <br/>
I sat on a bench and I prayed for the souls of the dead, and sketched <br/>
some of the interesting headstones. I took a hike at a nature preserve <br/>
attached to the cemetary.<br/>
<br/>
By the way? Dogs not allowed in Illinois nature preserves or <br/>
conservation areas, no matter how well behaved. These are areas for <br/>
the preservation of WILDLIFE. And I just looked on Atlas Quest now to <br/>
see if the clues said dog friendly - NO.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to say what box it was, bc there are bonus boxes there <br/>
which are not listed on the websites. But I had to hang out for a good <br/>
long time before they left. And so I only stamped 2 of the 3.<br/>
<br/>
So this is 2 weeks in a row, in 2 cemetaries, and 2 families who do <br/>
not seem to have any concern for teachihg children how to behave in <br/>
cemetraies.<br/>
<br/>
I will say, this last family did hide the boxes very well and <br/>
everything was sealed up nice and tight as it should be. But still. <br/>
The darn dog.<br/>

There were bonus boxes associated with this one so I will go back, maybe in the spring, so <br/>
I can find the rest. It was a beautiful area. I found a grave for a baby that had the dates B. <br/>
1912, D. 1912. Another headstone had a sea scene with lighthouse and boat etched in it <br/>
and a couple's name with the same date of death. The husband was listed as Captain and <br/>
the wife as Admiral. I assumed they died at sea. It was a beautiful headstone. Plus there is <br/>
a butterfly garden inside the cemetary there so I want to see it in the spring.<br/>
<br/>
I surely do appreciate how letterboxers who plant boxes in these amazing areas so that I <br/>
can discover them and enjoy them. Thank you, thank you.<br/>
