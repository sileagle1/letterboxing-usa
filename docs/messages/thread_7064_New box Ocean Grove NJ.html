<br/>
&gt; Ocean Grove, unspoiled by mass comercialism or development might well<br/>
<blockquote type="CITE">&gt; be the most unique town on the Jersey Shore. Begun as a camp meeting<br/>
&gt; retreat by Methodists in 1869, Ocean Grove still has a strong sense of<br/>
&gt; religious commitment and attracts a large proportion of senior<br/>
&gt; citizens. This summer resort is also a dry town as well. The Great<br/>
&gt; Auditorium, built in 1894 is a huge wooden Victorian structure, seats<br/>
&gt; close to 7000 people and is still used today for concerts and special<br/>
&gt; events. The boardwalk is a wooden boardwalk and has no concessions on<br/>
&gt; it, but you'll have a wonderful view of the ocean from here and the<br/>
&gt; Ocean Pathway provides a clear view from the Auditorium right on down<br/>
&gt; to the beach. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GSP to Exit 100B to Route 33 East into Ocean Grove. <br/>
 &gt;From Rt 33 head toward Ocean Grove.Â  This will take you through<br/>
&gt; Neptune.<br/>
&gt; When Rt 33 ends you will take a left onto Rt 71 and then an immediate<br/>
&gt; right onto Broadway in Ocean Grove.<br/>
&gt; Head to the beach<br/>
&gt; Near the sign delineating Bradley Beach from Ocean Grove is a gazebo.<br/>
&gt; Take a compass reading of 320<br/>
&gt; In a pile of rocks-they're big ones, you can't miss them-you'll find<br/>
&gt; your treasure.<br/>
