I have clues to a new letterbox in Sunol regional wilderness,<br/>
on my website at http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box41.html .  <br/>
This box has an orienteering theme.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a twist to the usual letterboxing rules.  Since the original <br/>
stamp is lame, visitors are encouraged to carve their own and replace <br/>
the one that is there.  There is one rule -- the new stamp must contain <br/>
the word "Sunol" somehow in the image.  This step, obviously, is optional.<br/>
<br/>
For those who may find this information useful, this is the 16th <br/>
state with one of my boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
