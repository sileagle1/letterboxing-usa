                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to everyone that has visited (and taken VERY good care of by <br/>
the way) my boxes that live in Bristol County.  Today, October 30, <br/>
2005, I pulled them for maintenance and will not be replacing them <br/>
until the summer of 2006.  This effects both my mystery box, A <br/>
Teacher's Worst Nightmare, and my series Camping Memories which was in <br/>
the Abram's Rock area of Swansea, MA.  I will be moving on the Tiny <br/>
Teddy HH that I found in the third box of the Camping Memories <br/>
sometime this week.  Thanks again for everyone's care and <br/>
consideration.  I hope that you enjoyed finding them and that more <br/>
people will come next year when they are replaced.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Kerri<br/>
