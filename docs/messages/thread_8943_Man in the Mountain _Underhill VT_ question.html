<br/>
I went up a couple weeks ago, attempting to find my very first box,<br/>
but I couldn't come up with it. I found the sign the clues mention,<br/>
but the clues said the chin should be at 140 degrees from there. I've<br/>
hiked Mt Mansfield dozens of times and the chin is North of this sign,<br/>
as well as being north of the entire Sunset Ridge trail, so I'm<br/>
confused by this.<br/>
<br/>
Help?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

just a couple of weeks ago that someone found the box.  They didn't mention 
any problem with the clues.  The only other person that I know has found it 
is Tom Cooch.  It's just a few steps off trail from the sign.</div>
