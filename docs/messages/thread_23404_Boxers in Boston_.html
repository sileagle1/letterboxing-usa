  Hi Tracey<br/>
<br/>
  I went to your site and after going there I couldn't figure out what <br/>
  relationship this has to carving a letterbox stamp. I then went to <br/>
  Stampin up Global, loaded a few flower images so that was worth my <br/>
  time, but still didn't see any products that could be used in <br/>
  carving a stamp. Now if you can find a supplier for the old white <br/>
  PZKut that Stampeaz used to have I'm sure that many letterboxers <br/>
  will be all over your site. I couldn't even locate your 'wonderful <br/>
  pair of scissors' as I wanted to figure out how in the heck scissors <br/>
  could be used to carve inticate designs in rubber/plastic material <br/>
  as speedball cutters and exacto knives can do. I have a wonderful <br/>
  Kershaw knife that can cut right through any eraser as well but it <br/>
  is certainly better at cleaning fish than carving stamps. There is a <br/>
  yahoo chatlist that is set up for blatant plugging of products <br/>
  associated with letterboxing so you might try this site.<br/>
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BoxHeads/<br/>
  Thanks for the lead on the images I found.<br/>
<br/>

Totally off the subject but, we'll be in Boston in September and would love  <br/>
to see the Red Sox play. We've looked online for tickets (Sunday, September <br/>
9th  is the date we'd want) but thought there might be a better way to get <br/>
tickets.  Any suggestions?  <br/>

Glad you enjoyed my site and sorry you didn't find the scissors I was talking about.  Here is the link to the page of all the cutting stuff we have:<br/>
http://catalogs.shoplocal.com/stampinup/index.aspx?pagename=listpage&amp;fsid=13c1d277-9887-4148-8939-3aeebf042fde&amp;storeid=1038724&amp;deptid=14118&amp;title=Cutting+&amp;+Scoring&amp;sortby=1&amp;circularid=7278&amp;pagenumber=1<br/>
<br/>
These scissors are used for cutting the fine details on stamps that we have to put to gether and don't want the excess rubber to pick up the ink on.  Hope this helps.  I'm sorry if I'm posting this info in the wrong place, but I thought the question was looking for cutting supplies.  That's what I was answering.  If I'm wrong for doing that I'm sorry, please forgive me.  I'm new to this hobby and am trying to learn all I can and share what I've learned.<br/>

My apologies. I thought my sarcastic post had been deleted, but <br/>
apparantly it slipped through before I had a chance to hit delete. <br/>
Please note that it is no longer posted.<br/>
I did go to your site listing the scissors and still can not <br/>
understand how they could possibly work for a letterbox stamp other <br/>
than trimming edges. Is there something that I'm not seeing in their <br/>
configuration? How could they carve the grooves normally used in <br/>
stamp making for letterboxes? If you consider that most carvers use <br/>
Speedball lino cutters or Exacto knives and remove very small <br/>
amounts of material, do you cut a complete section of material out <br/>
with your scissors? If so that seems as though stamp sizes would be <br/>
fairly large, and it would seem that fine details would be easier <br/>
with the Speedball cutters.<br/>

you'll get a cleaner impression of the image. They also recommend <br/>
lining up the stamp on the block so it's either flush with the two <br/>
bottom-right/left edges so you always have some reference points <br/>

stamping.  The thing, however, is the rubber sheeting that you're <br/>

thickness.  I have been known however on occasion to cut off large <br/>
segments of PZ-Kut using kitchen scissors (the kind you cut poultry <br/>
bones with)--it solves the problem of making the PZ-Kut chunk much <br/>

you cut the excess away too close to your stamp's image as you'll <br/>
always create a 'bevelled edge' cutting this way.  I wonder if these <br/>
stamps prevent that from occurring? I only go the scissors route to <br/>
make the chunk of PZ Kut more manageable to deal with on an <br/>
intricate stamp I might spend hours working on.<br/>

Daelphinus said it right.  Remember, I'm just a beginner in this hobby and didn't realize that some people do intricate cutting and gouging with their homemade stamps.  Yes, the Craft and Rubber scissors do nicely thru the pink stuff erasers and even the white ones.  They are made for cutting thru rubber and don't seem to see any difference when it's thin or thick.  Hope this clears up the murkiness.  It made the erasers so easy to make when you're a first timer and can't do the knife or have kids who can't handle an exacto knife.  They even make nice grooves if using the edge of the scissors for jet flames.  My youngest son is Jetboy and designed his stamp with flames.<br/>
