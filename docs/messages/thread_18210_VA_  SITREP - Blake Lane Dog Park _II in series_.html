Lane Dog Park mini-box (#2 in the park series). <br/>
<br/>
Picked DH (Dear Hubby) up at Vienna Metro this afternoon - our first <br/>
time near there in a long while.  Beautiful, sunny but cool spring <br/>
afternoon.  On the way back, nobody minded - at last! - so we parked and <br/>
I took a look.  Quick &amp; easy, as advertised.  Initial question was "5 <br/>
o'clock relative to what?", but that resolved itself.  Most recent dated <br/>
stampers had been by in January; pawprint stamp after those was undated <br/>
and uncommented.  Box was very slightly moist inside plastic container; <br/>
wiped it with a tissue.  Otherwise in good shape.  Replaced where/as <br/>
found &amp; very well covered.<br/>
