As people began arriving, some that I took a group photo of under the <br/>
falls...I waited and they left.  I tried again and again. Adjusted <br/>
things as guided and found nada.  Then I emailed the planter and got <br/>
daemon mail.  Is anyone out there with recent news on this LB? The <br/>
last revision on this at the LB site lists it as Aug. 29, 2001. Or am <br/>
I the latest news? (LOL)<br/>
<br/>
I am eager to try again!  I have made this hike several times in my <br/>
life and love it!! Otherwise I may have to replant one here!  : )<br/>

The planter of this letterbox is a friend of mine.  I emailed him at <br/>
work and let him know of your troubles.  You should hear from him <br/>
shortly.<br/>

I'm sorry you didn't find the box.  It was last confirmed in place on <br/>
10/21/2002.  I've been told that the slabs are vertical rather than <br/>
horizontal, but in any case, some slabs in the hillside come together <br/>
to form a slight overhang.  The box is hidden under some flat pieces <br/>
of rock in the deepest part of the overhang.  Sound familiar?<br/>
<br/>
I actually live in Rhode island, so It isn't likely I'll be able to <br/>
check myself anytime soon.  I hope that if you go back you will have <br/>
better luck.  Let me know if you do.  Or if you don't!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for posting!<br/>

Thanks for the added clue.  I will be heading back there in a week or <br/>
so and look forward to hiking it again. The scene is great and the <br/>
walk not to tough.<br/>
