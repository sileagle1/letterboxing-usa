Green  after the  words "Johnnys legacy" there is a new box in a <br/>
nearby but new location hopefully will stay better. Aslo if possible <br/>
could you change the Doctors name from bixby to Beaumont. <br/>
    Well that place in Johnnys hollow past proved not secure in times <br/>
of challenge . So pick up the path again and venture back toward the <br/>
brick church pass three evergreen trees along the right edge then <br/>
look through the darkness for the windbreak of trees where <br/>
encampments seek shelter.  Carefully travel off the path to the <br/>
right  heading toward a large evergreen . Between this tree and the  <br/>
boulder there is a few cut logs  between them under a rock is the <br/>
enlistment book for soldiers of the dawn that gather to muster on the <br/>
green. <br/>
