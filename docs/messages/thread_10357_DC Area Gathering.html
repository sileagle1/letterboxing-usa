                    <html><body>We had a great time at the DC area gathering yesterday!  Thanks to Firefly for organizing it and hiding a great stamp, and to Sarah for the event stamp and the other hidden stamp.  We had a dickens of a time finding it!  (Those of you who were there will know what we mean.)  It was terrific to meet other letterboxers; a special "nice to meet you" goes to Darren from Connecticut.  Hope to see you all again soon!  D and Shoo</body></html>
