                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there, everyone.  Personally, I enjoy seeing how<br/>
the<br/>
"sport/hobby/activity/past-time/happy-fun-time/shindig"<br/>
has taken off in the year since I started.  I enjoy<br/>
meeting others in our "society" and hearing about<br/>
adventures on the trail.  We all have stories to<br/>
share.  I highly respect those that have helped make<br/>
LBing what it is now.  Pete and Wanda are the best!<br/>
(don't blush, P &amp; W, if you read this)  I've only met<br/>
them face to face once, but I feel they capture the<br/>
spirit of the whole thing.  Do it when you can!  Have<br/>
fun with it.  Love it! I am inspired seeing the work<br/>
that so many of you have done in placing boxes and in<br/>
shutting off the tv and getting outside to see these<br/>
creations.   BRAVO!!!<br/>
<br/>
Miles of smiles...<br/>

&gt; I've only been doing this a year and haven't seen<br/>
&gt; these before. Is <br/>
&gt; this new? <br/>
&gt; Can anytone tell me what they mean.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As an aside, I think some of us, whom I won't<br/>
&gt; embarrass, are getting <br/>
&gt; a little too carried away with numbers. Does it<br/>
&gt; really matter if you <br/>
&gt; have found 15 boxes or 1500? No, of course not. Some<br/>
&gt; people aren't <br/>
&gt; physically able to devote too much to the hobby,<br/>
&gt; now-apparently a <br/>
&gt; competive sport, yet enjoy it as much for the simple<br/>
&gt; fact your off in <br/>
&gt; the woods. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I admit I haven't found 100's of boxes. I only wear<br/>
&gt; an LBNA numbers <br/>
&gt; patch on my backpack on the off chance a person<br/>
&gt; might see them and <br/>
&gt; introduce themselves, not to establish some sort of<br/>
&gt; hierarchy. I <br/>
&gt; guess I'm just not an in-your-face kinda guy. I<br/>
&gt; think like the rest <br/>
&gt; of society, status and aggressiveness are leaking<br/>
&gt; into the <br/>
&gt; letterboxing community.<br/>
&gt; I think the website volunteers are the only ones who<br/>
&gt; should be <br/>
&gt; allowed to brag extensively about anything! <br/>
