Columbia River Gorge!!!  I got off work early and John and I headed up<br/>
to seek out this lovely stamp in Ryan's African Safari series.  We were<br/>
shocked and pleasantly surprised to be the first to stamp in.<br/>
Unbelievable!  Excellent hiding spot.  <br/>
<br/>
This trail is one of the most popular and scenic in the Gorge for humans<br/>
and canines (personally, I have nicknamed this trail the Dog Track).  It<br/>
was cool, but clear and sunny.  You can only be grateful to be that<br/>
close to heaven on a day like this and, GET THIS FOLKS...no wind up at<br/>
the top to speak of.  Many times I've been up there and got just about<br/>
blown off my feet, but today it was perfect.  Anytime up on Angel's Rest<br/>
is wonderful, but today it was spectacular!  Thanks so much Ryan for<br/>
giving us an excuse to take this hike once more!  You really made our<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
