Absolutely!  With an upcoming event, my partners in treasure hunting <br/>
and I wanted to get a copy as a ...well, treasure - and found this book <br/>
way harder to find than any of us (who all have copies) expected, so we <br/>
made other plans.  Perhaps it is/getting close to out of print??<br/>

copy to solve some clues....<br/>
