ill-prepared.  He told his wife he'd be gone 6 hours, so he knew it was more<br/>

&gt; Wow, Jay, great work.  Did you read about the news anchor who went on a<br/>
&gt; hike in New Hampshire this weekend and has not returned?  I read a<br/>
&gt; brief article about it yesterday, haven't heard if there are any new<br/>
&gt; developments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I really MUST go back to Monadnock and find your boxes. I've<br/>
&gt; been working out and getting in shape and feel ready. It really wiped<br/>
&gt; me out the last time (two years ago). Compared to Monadnock, Mount<br/>
&gt; Sugarloaf is a leisurely stroll!<br/>
