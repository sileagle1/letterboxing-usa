                    <div class="plaintext-content">We found the first box of the ninigret series full od water.  The book looked <br/>
so sad floating in its little puddle that we decided to take it home...  <br/>
After patiently peeling apart the pages to see if any of the stamps were <br/>
salvageable I am afraid that The entire heap will have to be composted...  <br/>
Will put the box together (not in a glad/ziplock tossaway box...) and replace <br/>
as soon as I can get back out there.  Will let you know when it is back in <br/>
its home!<br/>

contain an inkpad.  Despite being found completely submerged there was no <br/>
evidence of water IN the inkpad container.  The floating inkpad was one of <br/>
the mini square ones with, evidently, a very tightly fitting lid.<br/>
