who had placed boxes in Fredericksburg, VA about the status of their<br/>
boxes. Here goes:<br/>
<br/>
Susan of the BobCat Crew graciously took me around in late May and the<br/>
following boxes were all accounted for:<br/>
<br/>
1) Antietam Bridge Stamp at Pratt Park<br/>
   This box was lying near its hiding place completely exposed. All of<br/>
its contents were there, though. I piled all the nearby rocks<br/>
available on top of it when rehiding. Animals maybe disturbed it.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Akoben/War Horn Stamp at St. Clair Brooks Park (or I think that<br/>
was the name of the park!)<br/>
    In great condition. A lovely, secluded little spot, too.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Civil War Cemetery Stamp<br/>
    The logbook for this box had filled up a while back. Some kind<br/>
soul had torn a few sheets of paper from his/her logbook, and four or<br/>
five boxers after had stamped on the loose pages. I slipped a fresh<br/>
logbook in; I'm sorry its paper has lines, but that was all I could find.<br/>
<br/>
4)  Justice Stamp at Alum Springs Park<br/>
    Box in great shape. Brownies were all over the place having<br/>
ceremonies and collecting bugs and in general being too darn cute!<br/>
<br/>
5)  Sankofa Stamp at Alum Springs Park<br/>
    The box had been wrapped in a plastic Safeway bag, and when I<br/>
pulled it out of the stump, the bag shredded. The Ziploc top is<br/>
cracked in one corner. I doubled-bagged the logbook and stamp inside.<br/>
This is a really, really nice park. Maybe the next Mid-Atlantic<br/>
gathering should be here? Hmmmmmmmm?<br/>
<br/>
6)  Bent Tree Stamp at Loriella Park<br/>
    Box in great condition. This is also a charming park.<br/>
<br/>
7)  Loriella Stamp at Loriella Park<br/>
    Box was fine. Both of Loriella's boxes are truly near some very<br/>
crooked trees! Mother Nature is the best artist of them all!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Susan for taking me around. Fredericksburg has some really<br/>
cool boxes in very pretty parks. A great boxing day trip-type of place<br/>
for us Richmonders!<br/>
