On to the question. I'm shopping for a new compass. I have a really old one that does the job but is not as accurate as I would like it to be. There seem to be a gazillion choices out there.

<br/>
JugglerMouse and I have purchased military surplus Stockard and Yard <br/>
compasses (SANDY 183). <br/>
<br/>
We found them up on eBay for about $30. They are not as good for <br/>
orienteering as the Silva type made for that but they are really what <br/>
we wanted.  New, they cost about $100.<br/>
<br/>
The reasons we love them is that they are rugged, precise, smooth <br/>
operating (a real plus), have a locking needle (keeps them from <br/>
breaking while stored and dampens the action when resetting), and can <br/>
be used in total darkness. Okay, not much boxing going on in the dark <br/>
but there are times when darkness falls upon us unexpectedly. <br/>
Navigating in that case is a nice touch. The tritium glow does not <br/>
screw with your night vision.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know your question was also about GPS, but I try to keep <br/>
letterboxing separated from geocaching. <br/>
<br/>
Folk coming to SLO Stamping in the Meadow, Oct 4th in SLO, bring your <br/>
compasses. Many of the directions will be in degrees and single <br/>
paces. *grin*<br/>

<br/>
I'm using the same compass as Sir B , and you really can't beat it .<br/>
They have them new at the Army Navy store in Stoughton . On Rt. 138 .<br/>
Expensive ? Yes , ( $ 90 ) but well worth it . The thing glows right <br/>
out of the pocket , will not dim , and this can come in handy . <br/>
Especially in the winter when it starts to get dark at 3:30 .<br/>
They are pretty much indestructible , and are designed for the <br/>
military , so they work quickly and accurately .<br/>
<br/>
Have Fun !!<br/>

Try www.us.orienteering.org/OGear.html for a variety of links. I realize <br/>
it's geared toward Orienteering but I'm sure you'll be able to find what <br/>
you need there. I have two Suunto compasses, one (Arrow-30 Comp.) I paid <br/>
about $40 for that I use exclusively for Orienteering, and one (A-10) I <br/>
paid about $8 for that I use for Lb'ing. On the more expensive one the <br/>
needle settles more quickly and holds very steady while running. On <br/>
both, the needles point to magnetic north, and that's what you want. I <br/>
would trust them both for either sport. In most cases, heading in the <br/>
wrong direction is not the fault of the compass. As with anything, we <br/>
all have our personal preferences, and I'm satisfied with the choices I <br/>
made. Good luck.<br/>

anyway, the garmin etrek navigator is the best for your money. i <br/>
have the magellan sporttrak.  kind of wish i had a garmin now.  but <br/>
the magellan gets me there.  garmin is more advanced with regards to <br/>
maps and software.  even if you go with the gecko, make sure to get <br/>
a model with WAAS for excellent accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
check amazon.com for the best prices and to help you comparison shop.<br/>

Hey there -- As far as GPS equipment, I have to recommend the GARMIN<br/>
GPS 76 series.  We have one for boating, and I also have used it for<br/>
geocaching on occasion.  It is a great unit that is waterproof and<br/>
seems to have very few problems.  It is nice to take on a hike, as you<br/>
can set it to backtrack, and retrace your route if you lose track of<br/>
right and left turns.  They also have a mapping one that is a little<br/>
more expensive, but will probably be our next GPS.<br/>
