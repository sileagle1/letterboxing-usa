&gt; Sanctuary? <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, the green team is right, they're at:<br/>

Sorry to confirm that the boxes are in sad shape. The wonderful folks <br/>
of RIBNAG carved a replacement stamp for the missing one over a year <br/>
ago, but we haven't been back to put it in. Although it's no <br/>
Yosemite, the Norman Bird Sanctuary is one of the nicest small parks <br/>
in the universe.<br/>
<br/>
"Fond Farewell" refers to the family's most recent parting from our <br/>
beloved Newport. Margaret and I first made a home together there in <br/>
the late 70s, and returned in the 90s. Continuing our long assocition <br/>
with that magical town, we're hoping to close on a summer cottage <br/>
soon.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the puddin' stone, the ocean's bluster, and the views, then be <br/>
sure to hit the Red Parrot!<br/>
