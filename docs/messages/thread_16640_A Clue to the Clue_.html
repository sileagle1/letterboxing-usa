<br/>
There once was a person of legendary fame<br/>
Who called themself by the handle of "legerdemaine."<br/>
Shrouded in mischief, magic and mystery<br/>
Those boxes and stamps have such a unique history<br/>
Of excitement and wonder galore.<br/>
<br/>
There also was a boxer from Connecticut named Mark<br/>
Who loved to go boxing with Sue from park to park.<br/>
In late October, Opus #130 did he find<br/>
With his family who were not very far behind.<br/>
Now this great find really made Mark's day<br/>
"Now I understand!" his sister would say.<br/>
<br/>
When Mark &amp; Sue returned to their home<br/>
Straight to their computer room they did roam<br/>
And what was found made them both kind of shiver,<br/>
Shake, shimmy, quake and really quiver.<br/>
<br/>
For upon the screen within the Inbox<br/>
Much to their amazement, bewilderment and shock<br/>
Was an email unopened from that enigma from Maine<br/>
Whose Opus they had just solved and made Mark go insane. <br/>
With shaking hands and with bated breaths<br/>
They opened this wondrous, marvelous bequest.<br/>
This is the message that they did greet,<br/>
"Another exclusive for your letterboxing gossip sheet."<br/>
<br/>
For attached to the email was a marvelous clue<br/>
To a box that was both exclusive and new<br/>
Wrapped in mystery, excitement and fun.<br/>
So come all ye boxers, come one by one<br/>
To our own humble letterboxing pages.<br/>
Where we hid this clue for you boxing sages.<br/>
<br/>
We thank all of you<br/>
For searching out this clue<br/>
But mostly our thanks go to legerdemaine!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
<br/>
Mark &amp; Sue Pepe<br/>
