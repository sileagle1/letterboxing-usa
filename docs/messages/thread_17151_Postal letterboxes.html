(grin)<br/>
<br/>
The Aztec Gold, because of the materials in it weighs in at 2 pounds 7<br/>
ounces.  To ship it from my home town to the first person on the list, clear<br/>
across the country, using the Unites States Postal System, cost me 9.00<br/>
dollars, including the Delivery Confirmation of $.45 and I can not track it.<br/>
All I will get is a confirmation that it arrived.  If it arrives.. And,<br/>
between now and then I get no tracking. And there is no guaranteed delivery<br/>
day, just that it should be there within the week.<br/>
<br/>
If I had shipped it UPS, it would cost $8.83, taken five days and I would be<br/>
able to see it when it entered their system and where it was until it<br/>
arrived.<br/>
<br/>
If I had shipped it FedEx, it would have cost $6.32, taken 5 days and I<br/>
would be able to see it when it entered their system and where it was until<br/>
it arrived.<br/>
<br/>
I was unaware that FedEx was this inexpensive.  Being a small entrepreneur<br/>
myself, I ship hand made wooden puzzles across country and I'm going to look<br/>
into setting up and account with FedEx and, mayhap drop my UPS account.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the idea of the priority mail envelope sounds wonderful, but, again, in<br/>
my humble opinion, I'd rather pay the dollar or two extra for the ability to<br/>
see where it is and where it is going.  That's one of the reasons that I<br/>
made the webpage http://www.myndworx.com/modules.php?name=PostalLB to show<br/>
where it's been (grey stars), where it is going (blue star), who's left to<br/>
get it (State by state list), the number of people in each state getting it<br/>
and the order it is going out in. But that's just me, an anal retentive<br/>
computer nerd. (grin!) who needs a place for everything and everything in<br/>
it's place.<br/>
<br/>
Given the amount of time and resources that we put into creating the Aztec<br/>
Gold in the first place, I feel like an expectant father, chain smoking and<br/>
pacing, awaiting the birth of my first child. (LOL!) I'm sure that others<br/>
are old hats at this and it's nothing any more, but this is my first Postal<br/>
letterbox and sometimes, we (read me) need that look of wonder as someone<br/>
else appreciates our handiwork and to hear those sweet succulent words of<br/>
"You made this? My god, that is so awesome!"<br/>
