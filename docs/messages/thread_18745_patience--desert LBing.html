&gt; while i am here i must say how much i admire you planters in <br/>
the desert<br/>
&gt; regions. being from new england i can see thousands of <br/>
thousands of places<br/>
&gt; to hide. recently i had the pleasure of going through new <br/>
mexico and arizona<br/>
&gt; and tho i was only able to do 1 letterbox in each state i was <br/>
struck by the<br/>
&gt; barren landscape and how difficult it must be to find a good <br/>
accessible<br/>
&gt; location to plant. my deepest regards to you desert wanderers!<br/>
<br/>
You betray yourself as a New Englander to say that the desert is <br/>
barren.  This happens when your eyes get color-dyed by green.  <br/>
(-: There is so much out there that is amazing and there are so <br/>
many fun historical and geological things to pay tribute to here in <br/>
the west.  Since letterboxing is so rare here, we can go most <br/>
anywhere and be the first to plant in that area.  There are <br/>
amazing places that can be absolutely awe-inspiring if you are <br/>
willing to get off the road a bit, and there are rocks and holes <br/>
everywhere to hide in with less large animals and people to <br/>
disrupt a box.  In many ways, we have it great.  Sure we can't go <br/>
outside and find 30 boxes in a day, but we still have so many <br/>
places worth getting to that it doesn't matter-the adventure is in <br/>
the getting there, not in the numbers.<br/>

Cadenza is right on here. I suppose it depends on what part of the <br/>
desert you are in. In Utah a couple of weeks ago I was standing under <br/>
a cliff poised at the top of a sandstone ridge. On the cliff face was <br/>
a row of about ten perfect letterbox sized pockets. The hard part was <br/>
choosing which one to pick. I also just discovered a place called <br/>
Nook Canyon on a map. I can't wait to get out there and see how it <br/>
earned that name. <br/>
    I am glad you could visit, but I like the desert best.<br/>

 but my eyes are gray!<br/>
i have to admit i have never had a love of the desert. lived in desert areas<br/>
off and on and still love new england. have to admit tho that the sonora<br/>
desert and the grand canyon were fantastic. i could have done without that<br/>
tarantula in the coffee cup! willing to get off the road? my passion is<br/>
offroading.....so i am on the trails more than off! i have to totally agree<br/>
that the adventure of the hunt, the paths one chooses is the fun of<br/>
letterboxing and life itself.<br/>
