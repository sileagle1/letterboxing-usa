<br/>
While the New Englanders were having the time of their lives in Connecticut,<br/>
my mate, John and I got into the spirit ourselves and headed out to the<br/>
Columbia River Gorge to seek out some of Der Mad Stamper's waterfall series.<br/>
We came up empty-handed at Wahkeenah.  Same with Pony Tail, though we<br/>
suspect our compass skills are to blame on that one.  However, we scored up<br/>
at the top at Triple Falls!  YES!!!  That letterbox is alive and well and<br/>
has had many, many visitors, letterboxers and considerate non-letterboxers<br/>
alike.  It was a cold, but wonderful hike and we had a great time.  <br/>
<br/>
So, those of you on the East Coast...We weren't able to go to Connecticut,<br/>
but we were letterboxing with you all the same!  I hope you had a great time<br/>
this weekend!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
