                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today, Butterfly, Bluebird and I had the honor of taking Butterfly's grandson <br/>
Grayson (sp?) the White Monkey, to his first letterboxing excursion!  White <br/>
Monkey currently resides in the very sunny state of Hawaii!  He is quite a good <br/>
hiker, mostly since he runs trails and ridges back home!  <br/>
<br/>
We were able to go out and snatch all (and I do mean all) of the boxes in the <br/>
"A Drive in the Park" series at West Rock Ridge State Park in New <br/>
Haven/Hamden.  We were also successful, due to White Monkey's superior intellect (he must <br/>
have that same special nose that Butterfly has for sniffing out boxes!), we <br/>
also found the Regicides Trail and the West Rock Ridge State Park box.  We had <br/>
a great time, even though the temperature was quite hot, and perhaps it is <br/>
longer than five miles?????  We would definitely recommend this series!  Can you <br/>
believe that the boxes have been out for two weeks and we were the first to <br/>
stamp in???<br/>
<br/>
After bidding adiou to Butterfly, Bluebird and Grayson, I went do an <br/>
undisclosed location and found two mystery boxes  :-)  Woo Hoo!<br/>
<br/>
And to think, after all this, I have a date tonight  (and no....not with <br/>
Grayson)????  Miracles never cease!  Of course, I think its going to be dinner and <br/>
letterboxing.....<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting everyone!<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  Grayson:  I'm hoping your gramma will let you see this:  You should <br/>
have a letterboxing name:  White Monkey would be cool!<br/>

White Monkey is a VERY cool name! How do less creative people come up with <br/>
names not only for themselves but also for children? Is there a link to see what <br/>
has been taken? My dd really wanted to be a Butterfly but I told her no way, <br/>
there was already one.  Is there a Dragonfly? Thanks,<br/>
