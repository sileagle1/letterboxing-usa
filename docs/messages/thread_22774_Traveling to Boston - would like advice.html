                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'll be traveling to Boston to attend my step-daughter's wedding, and<br/>
I've been given two days (11/10 and 11/11) to go letterboxing without<br/>
guilt!  (To quote her, "You CAN'T come to Boston and NOT go<br/>
letterboxing, even if it is my wedding!")<br/>
<br/>
Soooo, I'm looking for advice on what boxes I could do in the<br/>
immediate area using only public transportation those two days, maybe<br/>
even some that aren't posted on the LBNA site maybe???!!  Also, I<br/>
wouldn't be opposed to meeting any of you Boxton letterboxers for an<br/>
exchange/mini-gathering!  BTW, we'll be staying in South Boston, so<br/>
I'll be originating from there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
