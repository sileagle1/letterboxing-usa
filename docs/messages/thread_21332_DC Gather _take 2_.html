Kreepy Kelli, Chrissy and I ventured down from the frozen north to the 35 <br/>
degree land of DC to attend the DC Gather at the Pentagon City Mall.  We had a <br/>
great time, meeting up with old friends (Scarab, Tempus Fugit, and Sewsobizzy), <br/>
and meeting many new friends!  We played a great game called Clue!  Many people <br/>
who attended the gather carved people, weapons, and rooms from the game "Clue" <br/>
and we had to find out "who done it."  It was SOOOOOO much fun, though as we <br/>
were wrapping up, the security guards kicked us out of the mall for loitering <br/>
in the food court.  Grrrrrrrr!  (There were PLENTY of other places for people <br/>
to sit!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Scarab then called Chevy's Mex (which Scarab had reservations for at 5:<br/>
30) and asked if we could come early (say 1:00????), and they were gracious <br/>
enough to have us for lunch instead of dinner!  We had a great time, and they <br/>
didn't have to kick us out!!!! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Scarab for a GREAT DAY!<br/>
