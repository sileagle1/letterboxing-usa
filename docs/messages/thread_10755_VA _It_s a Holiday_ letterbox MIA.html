<div>Hi Lynne,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1.  X = eXchange.  That's when you meet 
another letterboxer and exchange personal stamps in each other's logs.  I 
met Mary from Virginia at a microbox and eXchanged.  I went to a 
letterboxing meet, a brunch, and met a bunch of letterboxers and eXchanged a 
bunch of stamps.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2.  HH = Hitchhiker.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now here is where it gets really fuzzy.  P - 
Placed and F - Found are very straight forward and defined on the website.  
But does a HH mean you found a hitchhiker?  What if you place a 
hitchhiker?  I have heard various interpretations.  For me HH means 
found.  The one HitchHiker I placed I count as a P.  But when I was 
letterboxing with a group that found 3 hitchhikers, which I stamp exchanged 
with but didn't take or move myself, I counted them as eXchanges.  Go 
figure.  Psychomommy adds L for lizard encounters and lots of other 
things.  There was a lot of rancorous discussion on the board on the whole 
subject a short while back.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>3.  Yes!  I have been an Edward Gorey fan 
since the early '70's when Amphigorey was released.  I have a nice 
collection of his stuff.  My wife made a two foot stuffed 
animal Doubtful before we were married.  I have a picture of my family 
and Doubtful standing with Mr. Gorey in front of his house on Cape Cod from 10 
years ago.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Do you know about the Gotham Book Shop in New York 
City?  Are you a member of the Edward Gorey House organization?  <a href="http://www.edwardgoreyhouse.org">www.edwardgoreyhouse.org</a>  My 
family were pictured in their first newsletter holding Doubtful.  If only 
we could get together sometime and see each other's collections and talk 
Gorey.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Do you know about "the dustwrapper 
secret"?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There I asked you three questions back.

When you find a Hitch Hiker it counts as a find and can not count as placed. <br/>

&gt; &gt;Great! Thanks. So I guess my signature should be P0F4HH1. eXchanges huh?<br/>
&gt; &gt;That's sounds very neat. As to the Gorey stuff, I took my long-winded<br/>

&gt; &gt;off-line so you non-fans out there don't need to be bothered by my<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Ok. Just a thought. When you find a hitchhiker and you place it in the<br/>
next<br/>
&gt; &gt;box that you find does that count as a "place"?<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Hi Lynne,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   1.  X = eXchange.  That's when you meet another letterboxer and<br/>
exchange<br/>
&gt; &gt;personal stamps in each other's logs.  I met Mary from Virginia at a<br/>
&gt; &gt;microbox and eXchanged.  I went to a letterboxing meet, a brunch, and met<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt;bunch of letterboxers and eXchanged a bunch of stamps.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   2.  HH = Hitchhiker.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Now here is where it gets really fuzzy.  P - Placed and F - Found are<br/>
&gt; &gt;very straight forward and defined on the website.  But does a HH mean you<br/>
&gt; &gt;found a hitchhiker?  What if you place a hitchhiker?  I have heard<br/>
various<br/>
&gt; &gt;interpretations.  For me HH means found.  The one HitchHiker I placed I<br/>
&gt; &gt;count as a P.  But when I was letterboxing with a group that found 3<br/>
&gt; &gt;hitchhikers, which I stamp exchanged with but didn't take or move myself,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt;counted them as eXchanges.  Go figure.  Psychomommy adds L for lizard<br/>
&gt; &gt;encounters and lots of other things.  There was a lot of rancorous<br/>
&gt; &gt;discussion on the board on the whole subject a short while back.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   3.  Yes!  I have been an Edward Gorey fan since the early '70's when<br/>
&gt; &gt;Amphigorey was released.  I have a nice collection of his stuff.  My wife<br/>
&gt; &gt;made a two foot stuffed animal Doubtful before we were married.  I have a<br/>
&gt; &gt;picture of my family and Doubtful standing with Mr. Gorey in front of his<br/>
&gt; &gt;house on Cape Cod from 10 years ago.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Do you know about the Gotham Book Shop in New York City?  Are you a<br/>
&gt; &gt;member of the Edward Gorey House organization?  www.edwardgoreyhouse.org<br/>
&gt; &gt;My family were pictured in their first newsletter holding Doubtful.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt;only we could get together sometime and see each other's collections and<br/>
&gt; &gt;talk Gorey.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Do you know about "the dustwrapper secret"?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   There I asked you three questions back.<br/>

We've all been round and round with this.  I am glad the Subject <br/>
line of this email will keep most people from getting involved in <br/>
this thread. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I went back and looked through the controversy this issue stirred up <br/>
last November and left it with my head spinning.  Do a search <br/>
for "too many stats" if you feel masochistic.  I was hoping to find <br/>
some answers and I didn't really.  <br/>
<br/>
So I reread the LBNA website: <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/faq.html#025<br/>
<br/>
I recommend you read it yourself but I will summarize what I found <br/>
over several paragraphs.  I wish they would put it all in one place.<br/>
<br/>
P - Placed<br/>
F - Found<br/>
Other Counts:<br/>
X - eXchange (personal stamps eXchanged with others)<br/>
E - Event stamp (Event stamps gathered at letterboxing gatherings)<br/>
<br/>
Hitchhikers count in either Placed or Found.  <br/>
<br/>
There are some specific guidelines listed for what counts.<br/>
<br/>
After that you are on your own.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to adjust my numbers to reflect this.  I do however like <br/>
to keep some track of hitchhikers separately so I will count <br/>
hitchhikers in P &amp; F but also list them separately.  <br/>

&gt; P F X HH ??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We've all been round and round with this.  I am glad the Subject<br/>
&gt; line of this email will keep most people from getting involved in<br/>
&gt; this thread. :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I went back and looked through the controversy this issue stirred up<br/>
&gt; last November and left it with my head spinning.  Do a search<br/>
&gt; for "too many stats" if you feel masochistic.  I was hoping to find<br/>
&gt; some answers and I didn't really.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I reread the LBNA website:<br/>
&gt; http://www.letterboxing.org/faq.html#025<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I recommend you read it yourself but I will summarize what I found<br/>
&gt; over several paragraphs.  I wish they would put it all in one place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P - Placed<br/>
&gt; F - Found<br/>
&gt; Other Counts:<br/>
&gt; X - eXchange (personal stamps eXchanged with others)<br/>
&gt; E - Event stamp (Event stamps gathered at letterboxing gatherings)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hitchhikers count in either Placed or Found.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are some specific guidelines listed for what counts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After that you are on your own.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am going to adjust my numbers to reflect this.  I do however like<br/>
&gt; to keep some track of hitchhikers separately so I will count<br/>
&gt; hitchhikers in P &amp; F but also list them separately.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Great! Thanks. So I guess my signature should be P0F4HH1.<br/>
&gt; eXchanges huh?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;That's sounds very neat. As to the Gorey stuff, I took my long-<br/>
&gt; winded reply<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;off-line so you non-fans out there don't need to be bothered by<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;fanatism! ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Ok. Just a thought. When you find a hitchhiker and you place it<br/>
&gt; in the next<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;box that you find does that count as a "place"?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Hi Lynne,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   1.  X = eXchange.  That's when you meet another letterboxer<br/>
&gt; and exchange<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;personal stamps in each other's logs.  I met Mary from Virginia<br/>
&gt; at a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;microbox and eXchanged.  I went to a letterboxing meet, a brunch,<br/>
&gt; and met a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;bunch of letterboxers and eXchanged a bunch of stamps.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   2.  HH = Hitchhiker.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Now here is where it gets really fuzzy.  P - Placed and F -<br/>
&gt; Found are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;very straight forward and defined on the website.  But does a HH<br/>
&gt; mean you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;found a hitchhiker?  What if you place a hitchhiker?  I have<br/>
&gt; heard various<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;interpretations.  For me HH means found.  The one HitchHiker I<br/>
&gt; placed I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;count as a P.  But when I was letterboxing with a group that<br/>
&gt; found 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;hitchhikers, which I stamp exchanged with but didn't take or move<br/>
&gt; myself, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;counted them as eXchanges.  Go figure.  Psychomommy adds L for<br/>
&gt; lizard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;encounters and lots of other things.  There was a lot of<br/>
&gt; rancorous<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;discussion on the board on the whole subject a short while back.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   3.  Yes!  I have been an Edward Gorey fan since the<br/>
&gt; early '70's when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Amphigorey was released.  I have a nice collection of his stuff.<br/>
&gt; My wife<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;made a two foot stuffed animal Doubtful before we were married.<br/>
&gt; I have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;picture of my family and Doubtful standing with Mr. Gorey in<br/>
&gt; front of his<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;house on Cape Cod from 10 years ago.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Do you know about the Gotham Book Shop in New York City?  Are<br/>
&gt; you a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;member of the Edward Gorey House organization?<br/>
&gt; www.edwardgoreyhouse.org<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;My family were pictured in their first newsletter holding<br/>
&gt; Doubtful.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;only we could get together sometime and see each other's<br/>
&gt; collections and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;talk Gorey.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Do you know about "the dustwrapper secret"?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   There I asked you three questions back.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;     Two questions. I'm new at this and I'm reading your code at<br/>
&gt; the bottom<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     your signature. What does the X stand for? Is the HH for<br/>
&gt; hitchhiker?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;And,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     ok, make that three questions, are you an Edward Gorey fan?<br/>
&gt; I have the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;book<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     The Doubtful Guest and am a Gorey fanatic! Very cool.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; The "It's a Holiday" letterbox in Pentagon City Mall in<br/>
&gt; Arlington,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; VA appears to have gone MIA.  Someone may have been<br/>
&gt; stamping in away<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; from the hiding place but it doesn't look good.  I will<br/>
&gt; double check<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; it on Thursday night.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; Being in a mall as it is I am amazed that it lasted as<br/>
&gt; long as it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; did.  I will think about whether to replace it or not.<br/>
