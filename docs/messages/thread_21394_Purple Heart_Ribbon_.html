Since the award that is in question, is for injuries occurring while letterboxing, why not just call it the "First Aid Box". Carve something similar to a Red Cross, and let it be  simply an award that one receives when First aid was needed. <br/>

Thank you - I'm a newbie, but I was having the same consternations and wasn't sure how to express them.<br/>
You said it well,<br/>

Remember way back when talk of a "Purple Heart Letterbox" created a huge stir on <br/>
this list? As I recall, it was the cause of one of our periodic flameouts and I, for one, <br/>
was VERY surprised when this current box showed up in circulation. Then, I was even <br/>
more surprised when no one made a single remark about it...  Thanks, Don, for <br/>
pointing out the possibly offensive nature of this letterbox, making light of <br/>
something of great significance to those who have received the real thing. Funhog<br/>
