                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello from the Rainy Pacific Northwest.<br/>
I spent the last week on a whirlwind camping tour of the Olympic <br/>
Pennisula of Washington State. I also spend most of today checking on <br/>
some of my own letterboxes in the Seattle area. We've been getting a <br/>
bunch of out of town visitors to our letterboxes and that has been <br/>
terrific!<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I found disturbing in many of the letterboxes that I <br/>
visited this past week was that folks were not double-bagging the log <br/>
books. Many of the logbooks were waterlogged or so damp that it was <br/>
hard to write on the paper. It was not for a lack of ziplock <br/>
containers. Usually there would be at least three ziplock bags in a <br/>
letterbox. But folks who had been stamping into the boxes would just <br/>
put one item in each bag. Stamp in a bag, book in a bag, info sheet <br/>
in a bag. <br/>
<br/>
I don't know about you guys in the rest of the country, but here in <br/>
the Pacific Northwest, we have all those ziplock bags for a reason. <br/>
It is going to get wet out there!!<br/>
<br/>
Please, when you are leaving a letterbox, try to leave it in BETTER <br/>
condition than when you found it. Please Double Bag the paper items <br/>
at the very least (when the ziplock bags are available for it).<br/>
<br/>
If you found the box and you saw some plastic shining in the sun. You <br/>
should replace the box so that NO PLASTIC is exposed. If you noticed <br/>
the tell-tale sign of a row of strategically placed sticks. You <br/>
should try to camouflage the sticks by tossing some leaves or duff <br/>
onto the pile.<br/>

Does it work? What a great idea!  I'll have to start saving those <br/>
little things.  <br/>
<br/>
I must confess, unless the box is a mess, I tend to re-bag things as <br/>
I found them, assuming the person ahead of me did the same.  It <br/>
could be some had meant to be double bagged around the logbook.  In <br/>
our own boxes, I also label my bags in permenant marker as to what <br/>
each bag is for.  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of people wrote about boxes being left out in the open.  I <br/>
must say I've never found one that wasn't covered fairly well.  <br/>
Every now and then, we could see plastic showing but only when we <br/>
were right on top of it.  Maybe it has to do with NH having fewer <br/>
boxers.  Places like Conn.  get a lot more traffic.  I would be more <br/>
apt to agree with the suggestion that animals found it or a non-<br/>
letterboxer.  I think most letterboxers are pretty considerate.  <br/>

I don't remember how we bagged it and at that time we were so new we didn't know what the heck we were doing! I knew that everything went in separate bags but as for then double bagging stuff, I don't think I did that. So sorry if we didn't in that box. Now I know. I have about 6 boxes almost ready to plant in the Southend area. Just need to get some first finders prizes. I am going to take the suggestions from this group on marking the bags so new people will know where they go and to double bag. I'm going to ask them to put them all in a big ziploc bag. I'm so glad you all brought this up before I plant them. We are going to be doing some series of stamps. One will be "The Green River Faries" which will be planted at parks and trails along the Green River. Another will be a "Gotta Catch em All" (Pokemon) series that my boys are doing. We also have some others we're working on. We definately have caught this "BUG"!<br/>

I think part of it is we're so excited to have found the box (did I mention I have a 9yr &amp; 5 yr old helping me.) and we're "tearing" it open to see the stamp and the book.  We often don't pay very good attention to how it was packaged to begin with.<br/>

This will remind me to pay better attention as I'm opening everything.<br/>

Hello from the Rainy Pacific Northwest.<br/>
I spent the last week on a whirlwind camping tour of the Olympic <br/>
Pennisula of Washington State. I also spend most of today checking on <br/>
some of my own letterboxes in the Seattle area. We've been getting a <br/>
bunch of out of town visitors to our letterboxes and that has been <br/>
terrific!<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I found disturbing in many of the letterboxes that I <br/>
visited this past week was that folks were not double-bagging the log <br/>
books. Many of the logbooks were waterlogged or so damp that it was <br/>
hard to write on the paper. It was not for a lack of ziplock <br/>
containers. Usually there would be at least three ziplock bags in a <br/>
letterbox. But folks who had been stamping into the boxes would just <br/>
put one item in each bag. Stamp in a bag, book in a bag, info sheet <br/>
in a bag. <br/>
<br/>
I don't know about you guys in the rest of the country, but here in <br/>
the Pacific Northwest, we have all those ziplock bags for a reason. <br/>
It is going to get wet out there!!<br/>
<br/>
Please, when you are leaving a letterbox, try to leave it in BETTER <br/>
condition than when you found it. Please Double Bag the paper items <br/>
at the very least (when the ziplock bags are available for it).<br/>
<br/>
If you found the box and you saw some plastic shining in the sun. You <br/>
should replace the box so that NO PLASTIC is exposed. If you noticed <br/>
the tell-tale sign of a row of strategically placed sticks. You <br/>
should try to camouflage the sticks by tossing some leaves or duff <br/>
onto the pile.<br/>
<br/>
Future letterboxers will thank you!<br/>
I thank you!<br/>

Hello from the Rainy Pacific Northwest.<br/>
I spent the last week on a whirlwind camping tour of the Olympic <br/>
Pennisula of Washington State. I also spend most of today checking on <br/>
some of my own letterboxes in the Seattle area. We've been getting a <br/>
bunch of out of town visitors to our letterboxes and that has been <br/>
terrific!<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I found disturbing in many of the letterboxes that I <br/>
visited this past week was that folks were not double-bagging the log <br/>
books. Many of the logbooks were waterlogged or so damp that it was <br/>
hard to write on the paper. It was not for a lack of ziplock <br/>
containers. Usually there would be at least three ziplock bags in a <br/>
letterbox. But folks who had been stamping into the boxes would just <br/>
put one item in each bag. Stamp in a bag, book in a bag, info sheet <br/>
in a bag. <br/>
<br/>
I don't know about you guys in the rest of the country, but here in <br/>
the Pacific Northwest, we have all those ziplock bags for a reason. <br/>
It is going to get wet out there!!<br/>
<br/>
Please, when you are leaving a letterbox, try to leave it in BETTER <br/>
condition than when you found it. Please Double Bag the paper items <br/>
at the very least (when the ziplock bags are available for it).<br/>
<br/>
If you found the box and you saw some plastic shining in the sun. You <br/>
should replace the box so that NO PLASTIC is exposed. If you noticed <br/>
the tell-tale sign of a row of strategically placed sticks. You <br/>
should try to camouflage the sticks by tossing some leaves or duff <br/>
onto the pile.<br/>
<br/>
Future letterboxers will thank you!<br/>
I thank you!<br/>
