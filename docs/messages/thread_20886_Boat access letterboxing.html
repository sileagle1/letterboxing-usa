Just wondering if anyone had planted a letterbox that is only <br/>
accessable by boat, and what your experiences were with it.  I found <br/>
a wonderful location nearby for a LB, but you'd need a boat to get <br/>
to it.  Being a kayaker as well as a letterboxer, this wouldn't be a <br/>
problem on my end.  But I don't want to plant it if the vast <br/>
majority of boxers wouldn't be able to get to it.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions greatfully appreciated.  <br/>

GO FOR IT!<br/>
Gwen planted "Heron and the Tinman" on Alamitos Bay in Long Beach, <br/>
and we had the Kernville gathering letterbox "Whitewater-Not" <br/>
planted so that it can be reached by whitewater raft or by walking. <br/>
I have a 4 stamp series that were carved for a class 4 section of <br/>
the Kern, but I'm a little concerned that someone might try to swim <br/>
for them so they haven't been planted yet. Maybe a WOM series? <br/>
Cadenza planted one on the Middle Fork of the Salmon, and my son put <br/>
one at the confluence of the MF Salmon and the Main Salmon. Not all <br/>
letterboxes have to be set up for the bulk of humanity. <br/>

Casco Bay Painter has done a wonderful series of "Paddler" boxes.<br/>
Though I must confess to not having crossed the bay to obtain them,<br/>
you can still check out the clues and/or email CBP for assistance on<br/>
planning a box like this.<br/>

There are at least 3 l.b.s which are accessable only by boat at <br/>
Mansfield Hollw Res., CT. I'm planning on planting one <br/>
entitled, "Message in a Bottle" in remembrance of the glass bottles I <br/>
sent floating down the CT River to the Sound.  A neighborhood friend <br/>
did get a reply back from one of his notes years after it was sent. <br/>
What a great childhood memory.<br/>

I thought about a "kayak location" just so. of LB  but make sure you don't <br/>
bottom out when you're planting!  You might also want to inclue the kayaking <br/>
price :)  KaRi<br/>

Yep I agree its not much different from the people who hide them <br/>
that are only 4WD accessible or a very long walk. There has been a <br/>
lot of imput on this subject. Go hide your box...if people want to <br/>
find it..they will get over to it. Good Luck.<br/>

Priscilla planted 2 'boat boxes' in NJ. At least one of them can be <br/>
reached over land, about 4 1/2 miles to the box by 4x4 or walking. I <br/>
found out yesterday that horses are allowed in that area as well.<br/>
<br/>
There's a box for someone to plant. Put a letterbox way the heck down <br/>
a horses only trail and name it Pony Express.<br/>
<br/>
I posed a similar question on the LBMA board recently. I wanted to <br/>
know how far people would be willing to walk to get a box. I was <br/>
thinking of planting along dirt roads, 5-6 mile loop. The roads are <br/>
OK to drive in the summer, but are a mess Fall through Spring; you'd <br/>
probably have to walk.<br/>
<br/>
The responses that I received were similar to yours in that everyone <br/>
who replied told me to go ahead and place the boxes. Not all boxes <br/>
need to be dog friendly, kid friendly, etc.<br/>

Living in Maine and being a kayaker myself, I have lots of ideas for<br/>
boat only letterboxes. My motto is that if you place it, someone will<br/>
come! I would love to have a day out kayak letterboxing. <br/>

&gt; But I don't want to plant it if the vast <br/>
&gt; majority of boxers wouldn't be able to get to it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm surprised with all those responses, nobody actually answered this<br/>
question.  If you hide a boat-accessible only letterbox, the vast<br/>
majority of letterboxes won't *want* to get it. Most people don't have<br/>
a spare kayak available, and most will notgo to the effort or expense<br/>
of renting one.<br/>
<br/>
However, I will jump on the same truck as everyone else and say, who<br/>
cares?  People that want to get it will get it, and those that don't,<br/>
won't.  If you plant it, *eventually* someone will go out and nab it.<br/>
 Just don't hold your breath while you're waiting.  =)<br/>

    That's exactly what you have to do to find a certain mystery box <br/>
that's hidden in a mid-atlantic lake. <br/>

Her Ladyship also read all the interest in boat accessible<br/>
letterboxes, however she must disagree that the difficulty in<br/>
accessing a riparian or aquatic box and the resultant decrease in the<br/>
number of those finding the box should prevent one from planting such<br/>
a box. Nay, in fact the difficulty makes the reward all the sweeter<br/>
for the hardy soul who accesses the box. Her ladyship had the pleasure<br/>
of participating in the placement of a WOM box that is truly boat<br/>
access only unless one is a very good swimmer. While few have gotten<br/>
this box it is none the less gratifying knowing that this clever (if<br/>
her Ladyship may flatter herself) placement is out there waiting for a<br/>
determined and adventurous letterboxer to find. Her Ladyship indeed<br/>
encourages you to don scuba or charter a boat and plant those<br/>
unorthodox boxes. If they're all drive by's then it becomes rather bland.<br/>

Funhog and I rented a canoe to get a boating accessible letterbox in <br/>
Florida. It was a really fun trip. Even though we were disappointed <br/>
when the stamp turned out to be store-bought!<br/>

Yep I agree its not much different from the people who hide them <br/>
that are only 4WD accessible or a very long walk. There has been a <br/>

find it..they will get over to it. Good Luck.<br/>

I and a co-boxer have planted one at a local pond, and I have <br/>
planted one that you could reach by boat, 4 wheel drive vehicle or a <br/>
4 mile walk in beach sand.  Good luck<br/>

Just wondering if anyone had planted a letterbox that is only <br/>
accessible by boat, and what your experiences were with it. <br/>
