Hi.  It has come to my attention that my last two letterbox clues were<br/>
never posted on the web site, because I listed my own web site as a<br/>
source for the clues.  Can I ask to please have these most recent two<br/>
letterboxes listed on the web site, in addition to the first one that is<br/>
out there already.  Thanks so much.<br/>

Good Dogs need Training<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The clues for finding the letterboxes in this series all have to do with<br/>
creating a good dog.  To decode the clues, answer the questions in the<br/>
clue choices.  Select A or B for the correct choice of answer, then<br/>
follow the directions that A or B (whichever you chose) gives.  For more<br/>
information about training your dog see the Dog Scouts of America web<br/>
site www.dogscouts.org <http: www.dogscouts.org=""></http:> .  Dont feel bad if<br/>
you need a lot of help with the answers.  There are a LOT of common<br/>
misconceptions about dog training.  People have been doing it wrong<br/>
for many years.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is at the Red Pine Area, in the beautiful Au Sable State<br/>
Forest,  with lots of huge and very old Red Pine trees.  Theres a<br/>
self-guided tour trail with numbered posts coinciding with the points of<br/>
interest along the loop.  Select the correct statement (A or B) to test<br/>
your knowledge about dog training and how dogs learn.  I have alternated<br/>
the color of each set of statements/clues, to make it clear which set of<br/>
clues goes with which statement. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Take your dog and enjoy the beautiful area.  Please act responsibly and<br/>
clean up after your pet, and dont allow him to harass the wildlife.<br/>
Please leave nothing but footprints.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When you arrive and park your vehicle, head East on the trail until you<br/>
come to a split.  You will pass numbered sign posts with points of<br/>
interest to read about at each one.  Youll go past 5 numbered posts<br/>
before you get to the fork.  When you arrive, follow the clues below to<br/>
find the box.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
True or False  Of each of the pairs of statements below, one is CORRECT<br/>
and the other is a COMMON MISCONCEPTION.  Choose the correct statement<br/>
from each pair  (which answer is true?  A. or B?). (I recommend that you<br/>
cross off the incorrect answer, so that you dont follow it by mistake)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      A.  Just as every parent has the responsibility to train their<br/>
child, every dog owner has the responsibility to train their dog to be<br/>
well-mannered, respectful of people and obedient.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
B.  Obedience training is only for people who want to enter their dog in<br/>
competitions or do some kind of specialized sport with their dog. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you chose A. take the trail to the right at the fork. <br/>
<br/>
If you chose B. take the trail to the left, and please tell us how<br/>
youre managing to coexist happily with an untrained dog in your home.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A.  If you use food for training, you will make the dog dependent upon<br/>
always receiving food.  You need to show the dog youre the boss.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
B.     Using food as a reward is a very fast and effective way to have<br/>
the dog make a positive connection with a particular behavior, and will<br/>
cause the dog to always want to choose the behavior that was connected<br/>
with the food (walking or sitting in the heel position is a good place<br/>
to hang out for the dog, because treats are often delivered to this<br/>
position).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you chose A. you get NO HINT, and you should volunteer to work the<br/>
next three months without pay.  Your boss is allowed to occassionally<br/>
pat you on the head, though.<br/>
<br/>
If you chose B. your hint is that the letterbox is between trail markers<br/>
6 and 7.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A.     Attention is a strong positive reinforcement for a dog.  So much<br/>
so that a bored dog will repeat a behavior that has been rewarded with<br/>
ANGRY attention, like screaming, chasing and scolding (running off with<br/>
the floppy disk causes the dog to get LOTS of attention in a big hurry,<br/>
follwed by a game of chase; lying there and being good causes the dog to<br/>
be ignoredthe worst form of punishment a dog could ever have).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
B.     If youve shown your disapproval (punished the dog) for doing<br/>
something he did that you dont like, and he keeps doing it, he must be<br/>
doing it out of spite, or else he is a masochist, or very stupid.  It<br/>
couldnt possibly be that he is so deprived of stimulation that he looks<br/>
forward to any kind of attention from you that he can geteven if you<br/>
call it punishment. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you chose A. the hint is to look for a really big RED pine that has<br/>
an eye on the prize (at shoulder level), looking directly at the<br/>
letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
If you chose B. the hint is that you need to look for a huge OAK, and<br/>
start giving your dog more attention when hes making good choices (not<br/>
getting into trouble).  Youll see a lot more of those good behaviors<br/>
and youll end up with a GOOD DOG.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A.   To train your dog you must have had some kind of formal education<br/>
in dog training and behavior, like a dog obedience class.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
B.   You can have a very well-behaved dog by just practicing a few<br/>
simple impulse control and indirect access exercises on a daily basis in<br/>
your home, without using a leash, collar or commands.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you chose A. take your next compass heading at the base of a large<br/>
White Pine to the right of the trail, and go to www.dogscouts.org<br/>
<http: www.dogscouts.org=""></http:>  and download a copy of Everyday Dog<br/>
Training to read.<br/>
<br/>
If you chose B. take your compass heading at the base of the large Red<br/>
Pine to the Left of the trail (Hint:  If you do not know your PINE,<br/>
visit trail marker number NINE).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A.   Dogs are Command-driven, so if you want them to understand what you<br/>
want, you must use commands in an authoritative tone of voice.  If they<br/>
are stubborn, you need to yell louder.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
B.   Dogs are consequence-driven, and will happily repeat any action<br/>
which results in a favorable consequence, making them very easy to train<br/>
(teach to make correct choices) without the use of any commands, force,<br/>
or punishment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When you think youre at the correct tree<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you chose A. take a compass heading of 245 degrees, and see your<br/>
doctor about your blood pressure level.  Youre inadvertently creating a<br/>
very bad dog.<br/>
<br/>
If you chose B. take a compass heading of 62 degrees<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A.  You dont have to take a procactive approach to training your dog<br/>
and preventing bad behaviors.  Just wait around until he starts doing<br/>
something you dont like, then punish him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
B.  Anyone can train their dog to be well-behaved by offering choices<br/>
and providing pleasant consequences to the correct choices (sitting at<br/>
the door causes the door to open; jumping and acting like a maniac does<br/>
not cause doors to open).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you chose A. walk in the direction of your compass heading for SEVEN<br/>
(the number of days a shelter dog usually has to find an adoptive home<br/>
before he is euthanized) FEET, and I certainly hope that you havent<br/>
also used this method on your children.<br/>
<br/>
If you chose B. walk in the direction of your compass heading for about<br/>
51 feet (the distance your dog runs between the starting line and the<br/>
flyball box, if his hobby is flyball competition).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A.  A dog can learn the difference between right and wrong by punishing<br/>
him when he does something you dont like.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
B.  The dog doesnt care if hes right or wrong.  The dog learns the<br/>
difference between behaviors that are followed by pleasant consequences<br/>
and ones that are ignored.  A dog will always choose the actions which<br/>
lead to the consequence the dog perceives as favorable.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you chose A. you will find the letterbox in a hole that a bad dog<br/>
dug into the dirt, and start chanting to yourself, I LIKE to clean up<br/>
after my dogs poor choices,  I LIKE to clean up after my dogs poor<br/>
choices...  (youre going to be doing a lot of it!)<br/>
<br/>
If you chose B. you will find the letterbox in a very old, fragile stump<br/>
in one of the furthest easterly sections of the trail system, and you<br/>
realize that bad dogs are created by bad owners!<br/>

You will arrive at one of the blue, triangular pathway markers after<br/>
about ______ steps.  This will tell you if you went the right way<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
