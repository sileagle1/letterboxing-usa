&gt; Geocaching has a clearly defined rating system <br/>
<br/>
Is it me or does this (rating) idea seem all too familiar and hint of<br/>
geocaching to some degree? Lest me remind those out there that this is<br/>
letterboxing and you should redirect your browser to<br/>
www.geocaching.com if you are expecting spoon feed me clues.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The best solution, if anything, is like what has been mentioned, a <br/>
&gt; short description.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you CR and others, clues are narrative and/or descriptive or<br/>
even better, short and to the point with minimal compass directions.<br/>
The fine art and crafting of a clue comes from the creative ideas put<br/>
forth by the placer and it is refined and tested by the gracious<br/>
finders. As soon as we start putting numbers and rating systems to<br/>
clues and boxes then you might as well tag them with an isbn/ups code<br/>
and count me out.<br/>
<br/>
mass produced for the millions? -NO!<br/>
letterboxing is interesting and unique and as long as phyto is<br/>
participating in this hobby there won't be anything mass produced and<br/>
watered down about my boxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do appreciate everyone's responses to the question I posed to this mailing<br/>
list, however, the point seems to have missed slightly. I am, in no way,<br/>
advocating that we have a standardized, "MUST USE" rating system for<br/>
letterboxes at all.  I don't like being dictated to any more so than the<br/>
rest of you do. Please understand something my friends. I am not, in any<br/>
fashion, advocating that anyone else should be able to rate your box in<br/>
place of you, nor am I advocating that anyone other than you should be able<br/>
to determine a difficulty rating for your boxes. My god, they are your<br/>
boxes, not mine or anyone else's.<br/>
<br/>
I am talking about a strictly voluntarily way for a placer, entering a<br/>
letterbox, could, if they so chose to do so, use this system to 'rate' thier<br/>
box.  If they choose not to, that's just fine.  This is, after all, a mainly<br/>
unregulated hobby.<br/>
<br/>
I do appericate each and every one of you who answered the question I posed<br/>
with answers that answered the question I asked and not the rest of the<br/>
hoopla, for it has never been my desire to go against the wishes of any<br/>
placer at all.<br/>
<br/>
So, based on those answers, I have started to code the Letterbox Rating<br/>
System. The beta will be available at my website for testing and exposure,<br/>
please feel free to share your thoughts on it with me by using the feedback<br/>
function.<br/>
<br/>
I do want to specifically thank those that have supported this endeavour and<br/>
specially Pandora, for her thoughtful comments. And most of all, I want to<br/>
thank everyone for not flying off the handle and starting another flame war.<br/>
(grin)<br/>
