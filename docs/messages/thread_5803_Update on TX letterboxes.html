Moonshadow,<br/>
I was on vacation at S. Padre Island (6-17-02) and decided to make a short <br/>
trip to the Brownsville area to do some "boxing". While all of the boxes are <br/>
there only one of the three is functional.<br/>
<br/>
Box #1- It's missing the stamp but the book and a torn $1 bill are present. <br/>
It appears that the box is too easy to find by the casual visitor. You have <br/>
a guy, Buzz, that stops by and pees his dog  and then  checks in on a <br/>
regular basis. It's kind of like his personal journal. Another guy thought <br/>
he had found a drug stash. He requested that you might leave a joint or beer <br/>
next time you're around. You also had the Alamo(?) Middle School stop by <br/>
once and sign in. Maybe you could contact them about making a new stamp and <br/>
maintaining the site.<br/>
<br/>
Box #2- First of all your directions say to continue heading SW, it should <br/>
read SE or just E. (the same goes for the directions for box #3)<br/>
The box lives but there is absolutely nothing in it.<br/>
<br/>
Box #3- All present and accounted for. Nice hand-carved stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry the airline lost your personal stamp. It was a nice moon.<br/>
