<body><b>Wild Walk (series of 4)</b>
<br/>White Memorial Foundation, Litchfield CT
<br/>Placed by Aili &amp; Bruce, Nov. 10, 2002
<br/>Easy!! No hills, some rocky/rooty sections. Less than 3 miles, plan
on at least 3 hours because you simply <i>must</i> gawk at the scenery.
Please stamp and rehide all boxes discreetly.
<p>Enter from the main entrance on Route 202. Park at the Museum. A visit
inside is well worth the admission price. Maps of the 35 miles of trails
which spider-web the Foundations 4000 acres are sold in the gift shop.
</p><p>Begin behind the Mott-Van Winkle Environmental Center, on the Trail
of the Senses (green blazes &amp; plaques on posts here &amp; there). Find
the sign that says Feel the holes, the texture and temperature of the
decaying logs See that big oak at 18º? It has a hole in the back.
<b>Red-Eyed Guys</b> are sleeping it off in there. You dont have to move
the rock, and please just position a stick over the box so it isnt too
quick to be seen.
</p><p><i>Fun Fact: Amphibian means two-lives. It refers to how an amphibian
begins life with gills breathing water, then morphs into an animal with
lungs breathing air.</i>
</p><p>Continue  through the Trail of Senses until it meets with the Interpretive
Nature Trail, marked with blue rectangles. Go left, northerly. Take a left
onto the unpaved road (still blazed blue), cross the paved road, and shortly
thereafter take a right onto the Little Pond Trail (black square on white
square blaze). At the T, follow this loop counter-clockwise. Cross one
bridge, then before the second one, duck (no pun intended) off the boardwalk
to a trail on the right, follow the footpath to the big beaver bitten tree..
