out of the house today or go crazy!<br/>
<br/>
Lockmaster and I drove north about 2 hours to Dingman's Ferry, PA. to try to <br/>
locate the 3 boxes that Silent Doug had planted there this past August. <br/>
After some confusion on my part as to the correct parking area we were on <br/>
our way to the treasure! The falls were just beautiful!! Too bad <br/>
Lockmaster's hands and feet were numb with cold by the time I located the <br/>
second box... This is a place to take your time and enjoy the view but it <br/>
was just a wee bit too cold for much contemplation today.<br/>
I haven't done much 'boxing this year so it was nice to place three well <br/>
carved stamps in my book. All three boxes were in great shape tho #3 had <br/>
some condensation in the box. Thank you Silent Doug for such nice well done <br/>
boxes!<br/>
Enjoy Life!<br/>
'Box On!<br/>
See Joy<br/>
