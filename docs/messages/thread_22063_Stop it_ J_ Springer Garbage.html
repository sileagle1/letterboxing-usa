am tried of it.  So tried in fact that I'm done with it, the hobby <br/>
that is.  It's a shame since I've been around since Dec 2000 and <br/>
have been the primary planter in my state and others.  I have been <br/>
thinking of just becoming a silent boxer but after this resent <br/>
thread I've decided to bail all together.  As of tomorrow I'll start <br/>
pulling my boxes so that they don't become trash on the trails.  <br/>
It's a shame folks have to be so politically correct all the time <br/>
and have things handed to them on a silver candy coated platter.<br/>
<br/>
My final thought:<br/>
Funny it was about PLB's that brought it to a head cause I feel they <br/>
should be called Postal stamp trading and not LB's.  The hardest <br/>
part of PLB's is standing in line to receive or send them and <br/>
nothing to do with what it's really about, getting out and ENJOYING <br/>
nature.  I wish you all good luck and farewell.<br/>
