Thanks for the cute stamp and the nice hike at the Price Nature Center.<br/>
I hope to get back soon to find your other boxes in the tri-cities area.<br/>
Yours are the closest letterboxes to me here in the West Branch area.  I<br/>
sure wish that someone around here would get into letterboxing and plant<br/>
some stuff for me to find!  I have planted 3 and my girlfriend from<br/>
Florida has planted one in this area.  I really love letterboxing, and<br/>
wish there were more in my area.  We saw a HUGE gardener snake, which<br/>
was acting a little "psycho".  It was striking out at everything, as if<br/>
he couldn't see well, or he was dizzy or something.  He struck at us as<br/>
we passed by on the boardwalk.  He must not be a "morning" person.  The<br/>
warm weather was obviously bringing the crawly critters out of their<br/>
hiding places for spring.  We saw a "teenager" snake, too, further down<br/>
the trail.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have planted about 15 boxes here at dog scout camp, but I haven't put<br/>
the directions out on the web site yet.  I don't want to attract a bunch<br/>
of people I don't know, coming down our quiet and peaceful road.<br/>
However, it doesn't seem as though many people around northern Michigan<br/>
know about letterboxing.  We were the first finders of your box!  The<br/>
boxes around here aren't very well frequented.<br/>

<br/>
I'm glad you enjoyed the box. I'm still really new at this and have <br/>
only found 10 boxes and hidden 4. I have a series of 4 almost ready <br/>
to plant along the rail trails in this area (Railroad Monopoly). Now <br/>
that the weather is getting nice, I hope to have them in place soon.<br/>
