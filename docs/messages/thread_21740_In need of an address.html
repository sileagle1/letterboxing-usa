                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just sent it to you off list :-) I didn't see your initial request for an address for the next carve-a-thon recipient - and I just saw you've sent this to letterboxing rather than the 'postal' letterboxing list - maybe that's why I missed your first request? <br/>
<br/>
and just a general thought I just had - I'm sure I'm like a lot of people who have way over 150 messages a day that come in from the few letterboxing lists I'm on and that doesn't count other non-associated lists and lists connected to my volunteer commitments - <br/>
As much as I'd like, I don't have the time to read each one, so I scan for subject lines and I also scan for personal e-mails sent specifically to me - <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would help for all of us to also cc the originator of a certain ring ? or to write to them personally off list? I've been trying to answer immediately as soon as I see a request for an address - and they've been coming to me off list - <br/>
Thanks for understanding - or maybe there's another way I'm unfamiliar with?<br/>
