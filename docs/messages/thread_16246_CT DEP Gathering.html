Hi Ct  folks.<br/>
I just have to speak up.Rocky Neck State Park is a great place. There<br/>
are many many boxes there, this is all true.  However we have already<br/>
had two  really great Gathers there. As we get into the late fall or<br/>
winter, the need for a warm gathering place would be welcome..Rocky<br/>
Neck has no closed building for our use. It gets windy at the shore. <br/>
I agree with Steve and Heidi that a winter Ice Breaker would be geat<br/>
fun.  Perhaps in some park or Preserve with a building and maybe ski<br/>
trails for cross country,  I am pushing a place like Northwest Park. !<br/>

Northwest Park absolutely deserves a gathering! There<br/>
are close to 20 boxes already placed, and plenty of<br/>
room for more. It's one of the best parks in the area<br/>
to visit. There are buildings to hide in to warm up,<br/>
and they've got stuff to do in them as well. I can't<br/>
think of a better place in Northern CT, except for<br/>
maybe Holcomb Farm...<br/>
