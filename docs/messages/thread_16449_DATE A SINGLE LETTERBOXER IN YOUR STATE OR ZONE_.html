handsome carvers of rubber erasers for hikes up rocky defiles, <br/>
defiled rocks, flame wars, cheese racing, sprains and inkstains to <br/>
last a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the many nerds and nerdettes, Goths and geeks, <br/>
geocachers and party crashers, you can meet thousands of folks who <br/>
can decrypt ASCII and hex, read a compass (both forward and <br/>
backward), Nancy Drews with arcane clues, cheerleaders and chess <br/>
champs, lawyers, engineers, astrologers and nuclear physicists. You <br/>
could even have met Martha S. if you had been a tad earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody, even those who should never be left in the same room with a <br/>
block of Master Carve, let alone a Speedball carving set, is welcome <br/>
here to find their soul mate or at least their X100th encounter. Even <br/>
though some of us own Two Cherries 0.5 mm gouges, you do not have to <br/>
be rich to join, just obsessed.<br/>
<br/>
Put your letterboxing name, personal stamp image, email addy, and <br/>
what kind of compass you own on a 40 page booklet and place it in a <br/>
mason jar. Coat the jar with plaster of paris and rock fragments, <br/>
then hide it somewhere in a National Park. Post the clues on any one <br/>
of a number of websites. We will get right back to you.<br/>
