It was drawn to my attention that there is a problem with my Tokyo <br/>
Flight clues. After the grassy field, you should stay on the <br/>
SOUTHEAST corner of the field !!<br/>
Here is the revised clue:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you were on Northwest Flight #7 to Tokyo, you would be looking <br/>
down and see me go on past a couple of sewer man-holes then taking a <br/>
right on a dirt path up a slight hill. You would see me stay to the <br/>
left when I reached an open grassy field and reentering the woods on <br/>
the SE corner of the field to a multi-trunked tree with a holly bush <br/>
beside it. You would see me carefully reaching into the southern side <br/>
of the tree between it and the holly bush. Opps you are gonewinging <br/>
your way to the Orient.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
