                    <html><body>Hey, Jolly G-Man, Mary &amp; I visited your Hook Mt. letterboxes today.  Loved your clues and your stamps.  The sign for clue #2 is no longer there (the brace for it remains) and the road is closed to the public for the winter.  That didn't stop us.  We were able to walk up to the start of the yellow trail, (#4), which, by the way, we were unable to find on the trail maps, but which made the hunt more interesting.  
<br/>
<br/>Both boxes were in great shape and the second one held an added surprise ..... Harriet the Hitch Hiker ..... which had been carried there by Walking Ed.  She'll be safe and warm for a few days and then will be sent on her way.
<br/>
<br/>This is the first box we found (or looked for, for that matter) with photo clues.  Really, really enjoyed matching up stone and bark patterns, views, trail and compass photos with the real thing.  
<br/>
<br/>The weather was warm (for January) and sunny, and the hike included some great views.  Thanks!
<br/>
