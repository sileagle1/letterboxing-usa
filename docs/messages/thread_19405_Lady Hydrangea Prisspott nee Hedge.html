I don't use a fake e-mail address. I just don't have e-mail set up. I<br/>
didn't use my main e-mail account because I didn't want a ton of<br/>
e-mail filling it up and I kept forgetting to clean out my yahoo mail<br/>
box and when I did I had to wade through all the posts I already read<br/>
looking for stuff sent directly to that account. I just got tired of<br/>
it and clicked the no e-mail option and closed the account (I'm not<br/>
all that savvy about this stuff anyway as you may be realizing). I'll<br/>
e-mail you privately about how to contact me, I usually remember to do<br/>
that but I must have forgotten.<br/>
