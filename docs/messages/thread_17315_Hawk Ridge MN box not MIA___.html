It's great to hear of another LB here in Minnesota! I look forward to <br/>
reading the clues and looking for the box. I just started doing this, <br/>
this past October and there are far too few boxes here in Minnesota! <br/>
I've done most of my hunting in Illinois on family visits. I'll be <br/>
placing my own letterboxes come Spring and I'll have a Dartmoor <br/>
exchange stamp to place in MN soon. I hope to get more people <br/>
involved in placing boxes here in Minnesota. Thanks! DebRocks<br/>

Hi - w've just returned from a visit to family in Minneapolis where we<br/>
introduced them to letterboxing - even gave them a starter kit for<br/>
Christmas. Hopefully, they'll help you get letterboxing ramped up in<br/>
MN - we searched for three together - and found two: the 45th Parallel<br/>
and the Grasshopper Chapel. (Think that we probably saw your stamp-in<br/>
at the Chapel - quite unique!) Told our family we expected exponential<br/>
growth by this summer.<br/>
Happy hunting and placing -<br/>
