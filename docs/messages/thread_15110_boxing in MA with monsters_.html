Also saw what I'm fairly sure was an amphibious Yankee Sasquatch, though I'm thinking that perhaps Nessie snuck home in my luggage from Scotland. All we know is that as we walked past this one spot, something that we could vaguely see as looking somewhat humanesque jumped into the water from the bushes. Perhaps a deer, but we couldn't see anything in the swamp when we looked - well, stared, really - and if it were any such animal as a deer (or baby moose, as we later theorized) we would have seen its head, right? Maybe the Loch Ness Monster is like Sea Monkeys and her microscopic eggs can be transported and instantly reanimated when they touch water. Thus, the shoes that I wore in Scotland could have picked up just one tiny egg that blew on a breeze (or traveled via another shoe!) from Loch Ness to Edinburgh. That egg stuck all the way from Edinburgh, through London and customs in Boston, over two other trails, and finally sensed water and jumped off of my shoe into the wet mud, then dove into the swamp.<br/>
All I can say is that if you are going to the Bakers Meadow AVIS reservation in Andover, watch out for Baby Nessie.<br/>

Please do try out the Skug River letterbox if you are in the area, it's a great box, nice hike, and the river is quite pretty. :) &lt;--- shameless promotion of Jocelyn's letterbox. :)<br/>

Oh I like shameless promotion!<br/>
The box is noteworthy especially of the notes left by the <br/>
local "children" who hang out there at night. Please disregard the <br/>
note on the front of the log book. Silly smokers.<br/>
