letterboxing... oh and I was sneezing too...<br/>
<br/>
Solved about 90% of Mitch's rebus... thought it might be enought to get<br/>
close &amp; we could figure the rest out on site.  The whole family +1 was<br/>
along on this trip.... all experienced letterboxers.  Compass, clues &amp; a<br/>
brand spanking new hardbound book for stamps at the ready.<br/>
<br/>
Without giving away location, etc... I'll share the details.  Followed<br/>
the footpath as directed... at a "Y" in the path, we went the wrong way<br/>
&amp; ended up at a bridge that is being rebuilt. Most of us were able to<br/>
get across on the 4X18 beams that had been recently set.  One maverick<br/>
chose to get feet wet crossing rocks &amp; stream below.  After walking a<br/>
little ways, we realized that the surroundings did not match the next<br/>
clues.  This is not a very big park, so we continued on the path, pretty<br/>
sure it would loop back &amp; meet up where we went wrong.  It did, but<br/>
several of our group were committed to finding a letterbox and marched<br/>
off in any direction that seemed promising.<br/>
<br/>
We eventually made it to where we THINK we were supposed to be.  We were<br/>
looking for a particular opening &amp; thought we found it, but it seems to<br/>
have been overgrown with blackberry vines.  Now... mind, you,  I am<br/>
dressed for genteel letterboxing on this particular morning... shorts<br/>
and sandals &amp; a t-shirt (damn the disclaimers!).  But, our enthusiastic<br/>
younger members are POSITIVE that this is the spot &amp; can almost see the<br/>
letterbox gleaming on the other side of this bramble!!  Since we left<br/>
the machete at home, we pressed a couple of sticks to service and hacked<br/>
as best we could at these predatory vines.  Blackberries are a<br/>
non-native, invasive species here in Oregon, and the only reason we put<br/>
up with them is because of the incredible blackberries they produce.  I<br/>
have no guilt pangs for beating the holy heck out of a blackberry<br/>
bramble.  This one was bent on revenge for every vine I have pulled,<br/>
snipped or otherwise dispatched.  By the time I was past the<br/>
blackberries, I was bleeding from at least 5 different wounds.  Once<br/>
inside the clearing, we ran to the suspected location.  Very<br/>
interesting... on the bank of this creek, it was at one time, the corner<br/>
posts of an old wood &amp; barbed wire fence.  A snarl of locust trees have<br/>
grown up and around this corner over the past 25-30 years and in several<br/>
places grew through the barbed wire, creating a living fence post... <br/>
beautiful.  The beavers had been at these trees and nibbled exotic<br/>
patterns through the bark and into the wood of the trees.  It was a neat<br/>
little spot and I was glad to have found it.  It was NOT, however, the<br/>
resting spot of Mitch's box.  We headed out once again and did battle<br/>
with the same blackberries...  I was injured at least another half dozen<br/>
places on the way out... mild PG curses and yelps as I crashed (all 6'2"<br/>
200+ lbs of me) through the last of it. Once on the other side, whatever<br/>
herb in the nearby fields that was currently doing it's best to spread<br/>
pollen, suddenly became an issue with my nose... itch, twitch, sneeze,<br/>
sneeze, sneeze....<br/>
<br/>
okay... time to go home.<br/>
<br/>
We'll try again later.<br/>

If I weren't such a sadist, I'd feel sorry for you, Thom. :-)   If it helps, <br/>
I AM at least trying to control my laughter.  When you find the real hiding <br/>
place, I can't promise that there won't be a few ornery blackberry vines, but <br/>
I don't think you'll need your machete!!!  (Actually, it sounds as though <br/>
your were REALLY close)<br/>
<br/>
Next time, don't listen to the kids... just follow the beagle's nose!!!  <br/>
(That is, if the raccoons don't beat you to it!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Better luck next time, buddy!!<br/>
At least you didn't have to travel very far!!!<br/>
