   There once was a set of little dwarf men who lived in an enchanted <br/>
forest. They raised a princess and when she rode of into the sunset <br/>
with her Prince they felt their work in the forest had come to a <br/>
close. They went their seperate ways singing Hi Ho Hi Ho it's off to <br/>
find new homes. Well several dwarfs stopped to reside in a popular <br/>
tourist amusement park in Orlando ,Florida there they get to see many <br/>
little Princesses and  quite a few young Princes. But Grumpy just <br/>
couldn't take the noise, or the crowds - have you seen the lines near <br/>
the castle, grumble  grumble  , grumble. Grumpy went on looking for a <br/>
new enchanted park where the crowds were less ,and the view superb.  <br/>
He finally settled in at a place called Mansfield Hollow  . You can <br/>
visit with Grumpy but mind- on a rainy day his mood may not be grand  <br/>
but underneath the rough exterior is a heart of gold. Park your car <br/>
in the lot near the dam they are not allowed near Grumpy's house.  <br/>
Walk up into the park pass the American flag fluttering in the <br/>
breeze. take a left up the drive  or climb the steps and walk left on <br/>
the dike. At the yellow  gate take a right . Grumpy passed by the <br/>
brick canoe shed with green windows on his way home one day , you <br/>
pass too ( on left  they will be ) .  Cross over the cable and walk <br/>
to the cement pillar and turn left. Beautiful  front steps and a <br/>
Maple lined lane but the house is gone now. walk down the lane . At <br/>
the bottom the meadow is on the right  you take a sharp left.  As you <br/>
go on up the hill there's a cement pad to be seen on the right pass <br/>
on by.  When you reach a clearing the bluebird house is on the right. <br/>
On the left are 4 Cedar trees. After the 4 Cedars there is a large <br/>
Oak growing out of the embankment behind here is the place where <br/>
Grumpy chose to live. Look over the lake , feel a breeze and soon you <br/>
will not feel Grumpy at all.   Have Fun.    <br/>
