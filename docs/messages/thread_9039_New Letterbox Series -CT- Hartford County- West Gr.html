<br/>
Difficulty - simple, I hope.  Probably fun for kids<br/>
Time - 45 minutes to find them all.  This probably includes stamping <br/>
in, too.<br/>
Directions to starting place -  From the center of Granby, take Route <br/>
20 West, approximately 2.5 miles to Day Street South on the left. <br/>
Follow Day Street South a short distance to the end. You can't miss <br/>
the big red barns directly in front of you that mark Holcomb Farm.   <br/>
(These directions were stolen, as most of mine seem to be, from a <br/>
previous planter.  In this case, I'd like to thank Tree Fairy and <br/>
Chester Copperpot for getting us out to lovely Holcomb farm again.)  <br/>
If you follow clues toward unlucky clucky you will soon pass the <br/>
brookside trail<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Details you should know -  This is a 7 part series that makes up<br/>
total image.  THERE ARE NO INK PADS, so be sure to bring one you<br/>
don't mind being cross-inked with every one else's.  You will want to <br/>
have a stamping surface (paper or page in your book) that is at least <br/>
7.5 inches high.  The first stamp should be at the top of the page and<br/>
you should work your way down, placing the stamped images close <br/>
together.  Be prepared, this is strange and quite silly.  The last<br/>
box has a log book and is inside traditional tupperware , while the <br/>
first six boxes are in a variety of containers inside plastic bags.  <br/>
Some of the containers are more micro than others.  Most are smaller <br/>
than a typical tupperware container.  <br/>
<br/>
Details you don't need to know -The sweetest dog ever, Jonah, waited <br/>
patiently while we hemmed and hawed during planting.  Thanks to <br/>
BBBunny for helping us make sure the boxes were in the right order<br/>
and for checking our clues. <br/>
<br/>
Clues:	This series is on a short section of the Brookside Trail.  <br/>
After you have crossed the large fenced in garden (making sure you <br/>
close both gates behind you), look left.  You should see the<br/>
Brookside trail sign with a bit of a dripping blood looking dot on it.<br/>
<br/>
Box 1<br/>
Stand facing the Brookside sign and look right.  Behind the fallen<br/>
log is the top of your stamp montage.  Replace it carefully, because <br/>
we want you to keep the location under your well, you know.<br/>
<br/>
Box 2<br/>
Just before the trail becomes log lined, find a  live and <br/>
dead birch next to a white pine on your left.  In front of those<br/>
trees there is a big exposed root with a striped stone in front of<br/>
it.  Under the root is stamp #2.  For this one you will want the long<br/>
sides to point down on your page directly under the last stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
Box 3 <br/>
You will soon come upon a huge fallen log that lies next to the<br/>
trail.  About  of the way down the log is a decent sized stone. <br/>
The stone is on your side of the log, not the stream side. <br/>
Underneath the stone is a stamp inside a container that once belonged <br/>
to my grandfather.  It's an old cedar bullet box.  I tried to make it <br/>
into a pencil holder and that didn't work.  So, in my attempt to keep <br/>
things simple and slightly less cluttered, I'm sending it out of my <br/>
house and into the wild as a holder of a rather small stamp.  Heave <br/>
that stone back in place and keep on going.<br/>
<br/>
Box 4<br/>
You will see a two trunked tree that looks a bit like fingers in a<br/>
"v" for victory position on the right side of the trail.  The<br/>
leftmost of the two "fingers" has a red blaze on it.  Standing next<br/>
to the tree take seven more steps down the trail and look left at a <br/>
sycamore (camoflage) tree with a pile of rocks at its base.  Look <br/>
under the rocks.  This one is small.  The opening on the stamp goes<br/>
at the top. <br/>
<br/>
Box 5  <br/>
Keep on going down the trail. At the fork, keep to the right side or <br/>
stream side.  You will find a fallen log next to a medium sized birch <br/>
tree.  Standing next to the log, take a reading of 80 degrees.  Go 7 <br/>
paces to three sawn logs.  Your stash is stuck into the end of one of <br/>
those logs.  This was probably not quite large enough a container, so <br/>
feel free to shake the stamp out.  Back to the path and your next <br/>
find.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Box 6<br/>
On the left side of the trail look for a gathering of 5 large <br/>
hemlocks.  Stand inside the group and head toward a spot between 75 <br/>
and 80 degrees.  You will see a tall, gray trunked tree with some <br/>
little hemlocks.  The box is at the base of the tall tree.  Head <br/>
further down the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Box 7<br/>
Cross a dry stream bed.  (at least it was dry in October.  If in<br/>
April you cross a stream, look for the next clue)  Half way up the<br/>
far side of the bed is a small pine tree.   Stand next to it and take <br/>
a compass reading of 100 degrees.  Walk 8 paces to a fallen log and <br/>
search for a snappy finish. After stamping in, retrace your steps and <br/>
go find the rest of Holcomb Farm's wonderful boxes.  <br/>
