Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've never had poison ivy. I've never even seen poison ivy! But after<br/>
the<br/>
Woe Is Me posting, and subsequent stories, I have begun to educate<br/>
myself..<br/>
because I don't want to get poison ivy! It has been suggested that those<br/>
who<br/>
get a bad case of PI should receive the Purple Heart...that traveling<br/>
stamp<br/>
for LBNA members suffering injury in the line of letterboxing. Well, I<br/>
would<br/>
like to create the Poison Ivy Sympathy Kit...which will travel to anyone<br/>
who<br/>
is willing to sign up by sharing their poison ivy horror story with the<br/>
group. No case too small! <br/>
<br/>
If you want to receive the Poison Ivy Sympathy Kit, post your story if<br/>
you<br/>
haven't already done so, then send my your mailing address<br/>
privately...I'm<br/>
at SheWhoPlants at aol dot com.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to let you all know that as of now I am *completely* <br/>
paranoid about poison oak.  LOL.  I've done a ton of research on it <br/>
now, trying to learn about it(and the first thing I learned was that <br/>
it has a bunch of different looks, and they all look like every <br/>
other plant to me...and the second thing I learned is that ivy/oak <br/>
are basically the same thing, just on differernt coasts, <br/>
interesting).<br/>
I've become so paranoid that I am now having nightmares about poison <br/>
oak.  I dreamt the other night that my dog had carried over to me a <br/>
bunch of the harmless looking twigs of the "winter photos of poison <br/>
oak" variety.  I touched them thinking they were harmless, and then <br/>
of course realized otherwise and freaked out.  <br/>
Later in another dream I walked though a patch and began itching <br/>
like crazy.<br/>
The night I read all of the poison ivy/oak posts, I had just gotten <br/>
back from letterboxing.  Reading all of your posts had me itching in <br/>
my chair and I was sure it had gotten me that day.  Kind of like how <br/>
when you watched the movie Arachnaphobia you feel spiders crawling <br/>
all over you...<br/>
So thanks, lol.  But I *am* going to buy those cards!!<br/>
