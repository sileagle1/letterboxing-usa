                    <div class="plaintext-content">The HappyMapper reports as of 14 Sept 02, that Twograysquirrels' Teddy <br/>
Roosevelt Island letterbox and stamp is in good shape, properly hidden in <br/>
the its usual place, and somebody has been kind enough to replenish the Lb <br/>
with a fresh log.  The new log probably has at least 30 pages to go.<br/>
<br/>
One observation relevant to other recent topics.  I first visited this site <br/>
about two years ago, and at that time there was no sign of the hidden <br/>
letterbox. Today there is a well worn trail leading to it. Oddly enough, the <br/>
trail probably won't give it away (you have to see to understand).<br/>
