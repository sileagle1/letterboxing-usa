It must have been a near miss on Sunday at Cheesequake State Park!!<br/>
How did you like our 'pricker protector? When we got there the box was "way" <br/>
out of arms length in it's hiding place and we had to give some thought to <br/>
how to get to it with the stickers protecting it so well..with the help of a <br/>
long branch we inched it up the log after doing some fancy foot work on <br/>
those thorny things!!<br/>
Glad you were able to benefit from "those who went before"!! Sorry we missed <br/>
you two!!<br/>
Thanks for all the new boxes!!!<br/>
<br/>
                           See Joy  and Lockmaster<br/>

PS. We found another Log book at "Fisherman's Point" outside of the box..it <br/>
was smaller than the one inside..we placed it in the box along with the one <br/>
we stamped into...<br/>
