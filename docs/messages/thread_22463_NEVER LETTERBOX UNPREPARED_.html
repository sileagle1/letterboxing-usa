Being properly prepared should be part of any outdoor sport or <br/>
excursion.  Saying one should "bring a friend" not only implies that <br/>
someone else should be responsible for you, but also that twice as many <br/>
people may end up lost.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.<br/>

Be prepared and be proficient.<br/>
