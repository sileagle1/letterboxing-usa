think letterboxing in Kernville will be in our weekend plans after all. So <br/>
sorry if we're disappointing any one. Hopefully we'll soon be able to meet with <br/>
all who we might have exchanged with, especially Buzzard with whom we hoped to <br/>
personally give great kudos for his boxes, recently found.<br/>
<br/>
To Don and Gwen who we also looked forward to meeting, thank you for your <br/>
efforts. I know all the other attendees, who are feeling fine, will have a <br/>
wonderful weekend.<br/>
