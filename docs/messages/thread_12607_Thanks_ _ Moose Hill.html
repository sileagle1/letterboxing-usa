                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for all the good advice on finding wood for stamp backing and <br/>
the right glue! Added my first backing today and seems good.<br/>
Found a piece of 3" by 2 feet lumber just 1/4 inch thick at Home <br/>
Depot for ninety cents.  Have to confess my 12-year old sawed off the <br/>
first one for me -- gave her a chance to demo what she is learning in <br/>
her shaker bench class at school!<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping/planning on adding a 1 or 2 boxes to Moose Hill in time <br/>
for the May 18th Spring Festival there (RustyPuff and CSCM will have <br/>
a letterboxing table) -- not event boxes, just ordinary boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Again thanks for all the friendly help!<br/>

that day.<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to let everyone know that unfortunately, due to the crappy <br/>
economy, a whole bunch of positions in Mass Audubon (throughout the state) <br/>
are being eliminated....mine is one of them. So while I will still be having <br/>
the table I will technically no longer be working at Moose Hill.<br/>
<br/>
So I want all those letterboxers out there to join us at the festival May <br/>
18th at Moose Hill sanctuary in Sharon, MA to show your support and help them <br/>
raise money...so no one else gets laid off :)<br/>
<br/>
Looking for a new adventure..<br/>
