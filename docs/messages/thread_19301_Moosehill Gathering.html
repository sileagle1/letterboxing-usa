My boys really enjoyed themselves and I was glad to see them talking with other kids whose parents are obsessed ... er ... interested in this hobby as well! (At least they know I'm not the only crazy one!) hehehe<br/>
<br/>
We did try to find Boulders but was unsuccessful. My littlest one was getting tired and starting to whine. Since I didn't have any cheese to go with the whine...I decided to head for home! ;) <br/>
<br/>
We really had a great time! Thanks so much! <br/>

The exchange was a frenzy ... we don't know how you guys keep up with <br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
Some nice stamps, some nice people, and a nice location -- and we got <br/>
three of the seven boxes in the sanctuary to boot (plus one of Camera <br/>
Obscura's obscure clues -- we'll have fun with that one!)<br/>
