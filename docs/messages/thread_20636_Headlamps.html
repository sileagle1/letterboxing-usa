Hi all ...<br/>
<br/>
I already made the purchase, but I was curious to get opinions <br/>
anyway about headlamps.  Do any of you carry them?  Anjabanja and I <br/>
routinely 'box until the sun stops shining ... and as the days are <br/>
getting shorter, we're more often than not finishing our hikes in <br/>
the dim light of dusk.<br/>
<br/>
At the MMM we met up with a few other 'boxers and hunted well into <br/>
the darkness.  Our little Mag light flashlight is great for peering <br/>
into dark holes to look for boxes, but not very good for lighting up <br/>
the trail after dark.<br/>
<br/>
So we decided to buy headlamps.<br/>
<br/>
We don't need anything fancy .. a simple LED lamp will do.  I <br/>
purchased the Petzl Tikkina last night from Eastern Mountain Sports <br/>
for $23.  It's light-weight (2.8 oz), has two LED lights that <br/>
provide about 40 feet of light and came with 3 AAA batteries that <br/>
should last about 120 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Do others carry headlamps?  What brands/kinds do you like?  What <br/>
features do you find useful?  How durable have they been (my main <br/>
concern, as it will spend most of its time bouncing around in my <br/>
backpack)?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

I know of several boxers who use those ? Black and Decker snake-type <br/>
flashlights.  You can wrap it around your neck/head/shoulder/whatever <br/>
when you are walking around, and you can unwrap it and use it in the <br/>
hidey holes, too.<br/>
<br/>
It fits into a backpack nicely, and it is made to be durable.<br/>
<br/>
Plus it makes a cool fashion statement - you look like a Borg!<br/>

Yep, I carry one with me always. The trick is keeping extra batteries!<br/>
Petzel is the best brand out there for several reasons. One, it is<br/>
very lightweight. 2. It has a twist on/off action, with prevents it<br/>
from accidentally switching itself on and draining your batteries. 3.<br/>
It comes with an extra bulb behind the light in case you break yours.<br/>
4. It has a waterproof battery cover. Plus it is affordable.<br/>
Good purchase!<br/>

rather wrong with that picture. <br/>

Mine has an on/off switch that locks so it can't accidentally get turned on <br/>
if bounced around, a feature that works great for me, and, after one particular <br/>
outing, I found out it's pretty waterproof too.     <br/>

Nooooooo, nature at night is a whole 'nother experience.  It's great.   More <br/>
hearing than seeing.  The folks at the county forest preserve district here in <br/>
my neck of the woods even give outdoor night tours of the preserves and hold <br/>
night classes to let folks experience the various things that go bump in the <br/>
night in the woods &amp; fields.  Bats, frogs, owls, etc etc etc.  And letterboxing <br/>
with a full moon?  Very nice experience.  A friend has a bumper sticker that <br/>
she made that reads "Boxes-With-Bats" and another one that reads "Letterboxing <br/>
With Owls Is A Hoot".   Groaners, yes, but it's the thought that counts.     <br/>
<br/>
The Graue Mill, in the Fullersburg Forest Preserve, currently has some <br/>
evening and night tours they're going to offer on Saturday nights.  Frederick Graue, <br/>
back in the mid-1800s, was a station master for the Underground Railroad.  <br/>
Supposedly these evening tours thru the woods in the area are going to give <br/>
folks a teeny bit of a idea of what it must have been like for the escaped slaves <br/>
who travelled at night thru these woods from one safe station to the next.<br/>
<br/>
The only trouble around here is that so many places, like county forest <br/>
preserves, close at sundown unless one is with a specific tour or class.   But <br/>
we've done that too -- signed up for a tour that we think, from reading the clues <br/>
and knowing the area, is going to come somewhat close to a box, so we hang <br/>
back at the very end of the group, we disappear to take a personal side trip for <br/>
the box, we catch up again a short time later, and nobody even knows we were <br/>
gone.  <br/>
<br/>
But if a person really wants to get into raccoons at all and their social <br/>
lives, try my two Naperville Riverwalk boxes at night.  The Riverwalk is open <br/>
almost 24  hours a day, except for the fact that one of my boxes is hidden in an <br/>
area that closes at 10pm because that part of the woods comes in extremely <br/>
close to some luxury condos.  And as long as you stay on the east side of Geezer <br/>
after dark, your footing will be safe &amp; secure for the other box.  Some of the <br/>
raccoon antics are absolutely hysterical.  And  baby raccoons out for a <br/>
moonlight raid are very cute kids, even if one thinks unkindly of the adults.  I <br/>
think searching for those two boxes at night might be more fun than during the <br/>
day, unless one was going to make a day of it and add a bunch of shopping at <br/>
the area Naperville stores -- if so, I highly recommend snacking at the Cookie <br/>
Dough store.   It's always worth it to snack at the Cookie Dough store.<br/>
<br/>
There are good reasons to be out at night.  <br/>

A clarification ...<br/>
<br/>
The headlamp I bought (and many that are commonly in use now) use <br/>
LED lights, not standard bulbs.  They technically don't burn out and <br/>
don't need to be replaced.  The newest LED technology is also much <br/>
brighter than most conventional bulbs.<br/>
<br/>
You can get headlamps that have halogen bulbs, though, either alone <br/>
or in addition to LED lamps.<br/>

Nope, not as a routine.  But as days get shorter, I'm sure we'll end <br/>
up walking off the trail as darkness looms - or has already come.  <br/>
In the case of last weekend, we were motiviated to box past dark: we <br/>
were with other letterboxers and we were hunting some of over 120 <br/>
temporary boxes.  Now or never, really.<br/>
<br/>
But in general, no.  Headlamps are just a precaution.<br/>
<br/>
In the spring we hiked Mount Monadnock and it took longer than we <br/>
anticipated to climb.  We did not have flashlights with us that day <br/>
and barely got off the mountain before dark.  Another good reason to <br/>
carry a headlamp -- just-in-case!<br/>

moonlight raid are very cute kids, even if one thinks unkindly of the adults. I <br/>
think searching for those two boxes at night might be more fun than during the <br/>
day, unless one was going to make a day of it and add a bunch of shopping at <br/>
the area Naperville stores -- if so, I highly recommend snacking at the Cookie <br/>
Dough store. It's always worth it to snack at the Cookie Dough store.<br/>

&gt; Petzel is the best brand out there for several reasons. One, it is<br/>
&gt; very lightweight. 2. It has a twist on/off action, with prevents it<br/>

3.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I already made the purchase, but I was curious to get opinions <br/>
&gt; &gt; anyway about headlamps.  Do any of you carry them?  Anjabanja <br/>
and I <br/>
&gt; &gt; routinely 'box until the sun stops shining ... and as the days <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; At the MMM we met up with a few other 'boxers and hunted well <br/>
into <br/>
&gt; &gt; the darkness.  Our little Mag light flashlight is great for <br/>
peering <br/>
&gt; &gt; into dark holes to look for boxes, but not very good for <br/>
lighting up <br/>
&gt; &gt; the trail after dark.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So we decided to buy headlamps.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We don't need anything fancy .. a simple LED lamp will do.  I <br/>
&gt; &gt; purchased the Petzl Tikkina last night from Eastern Mountain <br/>
Sports <br/>
&gt; &gt; for $23.  It's light-weight (2.8 oz), has two LED lights that <br/>
&gt; &gt; provide about 40 feet of light and came with 3 AAA batteries <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; &gt; should last about 120 hours.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Do others carry headlamps?  What brands/kinds do you like?  What <br/>
&gt; &gt; features do you find useful?  How durable have they been (my <br/>
main <br/>
&gt; &gt; concern, as it will spend most of its time bouncing around in my <br/>

Many places ...<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Mountain Sports<br/>
REI<br/>
Amazon.com<br/>
<br/>
Probably any Wilderness or Hiking store.  Petzl is one of the <br/>
premier brands of headlamp manufactuers.<br/>

You can find dealers in your area by visiting their website:<br/>

I know of several boxers who use those ? Black and<br/>
Decker snake-type <br/>
flashlights.  You can wrap it around your<br/>
neck/head/shoulder/whatever <br/>
when you are walking around, and you can unwrap it and<br/>
use it in the <br/>
hidey holes, too.<br/>
<br/>
It fits into a backpack nicely, and it is made to be<br/>
durable.<br/>
<br/>
Plus it makes a cool fashion statement - you look like<br/>
a Borg!<br/>

Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday. <br/>

Having only two evenings and two mornings to box, with an 8 hour <br/>
drive at either end, then Yes we will box at night.  And even in the <br/>
drizzle, with a big doorman's umbrella.  With luck you can hook it <br/>
over a couple low tree branches to hold it.  <br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed boxing with CPAScott and Anja (spelling?)  We were a big <br/>
boisterous group, though, and the only wild animals we encountered <br/>
were each other.  <br/>
<br/>
I once boxed at night by the light of my cell phone buttons.  It was <br/>
such a small park, how could it be that dark?  Do you know it is <br/>
easy to find a clue at night that uses a holly bush for a landmark?  <br/>
OWW!  No, the cell phone didn't light up the trail, just the clues <br/>
and the compass.  <br/>

you!  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi all ...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I already made the purchase, but I was curious to get opinions <br/>
&gt; &gt; anyway about headlamps.  Do any of you carry them?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know of several boxers who use those ? Black and Decker snake-<br/>
type <br/>
&gt; flashlights.  You can wrap it around your <br/>
neck/head/shoulder/whatever <br/>
&gt; when you are walking around, and you can unwrap it and use it in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; hidey holes, too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It fits into a backpack nicely, and it is made to be durable.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Plus it makes a cool fashion statement - you look like a Borg!<br/>

With the days getting shorter, and the more boxes I want to find, I <br/>
actually went to EMS last night and found these Petzl headlamps. :) <br/>
I'm heading into a profession where I could use these anyways, so <br/>
went ahead and spent the extra 12 bucks and got the 4 LED version, <br/>
which has 3 light intensities and a flashing mode. :) Truly a nice <br/>
purchase, incredibly light compared to the 4 AA version lamps, <br/>
although that extra, large halogen lamp in the middle might have <br/>
been nice.........Oh well. :) Happy trails. Thanks for the idea <br/>
though, never would have thought to buy these had I not seen it here!<br/>
