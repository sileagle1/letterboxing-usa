will get you a long way.  <br/>

If you look shifty, shady, etc people will be a lot more suspicious <br/>
than if you're closely examining the elements of nature (even if it <br/>
does involve tupperware). <br/>

**See funny story below if you want the long version....<br/>
<br/>
-Steve and Heidi <br/>
(Steve often acts like he's teaching Heidi field botany when others <br/>
walk by)<br/>
<br/>
Funny story:   While in Myrtle Beach with HER parents, Steve and <br/>
Heidi decided to grab a certain letterbox that's in a...more <br/>
developed (?) area next to a firehouse and some lower-income housing. <br/>
Doc (heidi's dad) is a real BS'er and could sell ice to Eskimos as <br/>
they sat on a glacier. Steve runs out to the edge of a pond... which <br/>
was really a water retention basin...and brings it back to log-in in <br/>
the truck.  Just then 4 kids on bikes decide to gather on the <br/>
boardwalk about 10 feet from the box.  <br/>
<br/>
 After we waited 20 minutes for them to leave we devised a plan.   S, <br/>
H and D approached the kids. Doc played the lost tourist and took a <br/>
map and Heidi to ask for directions to the Pavilion. If you've EVER <br/>
been in Myrtle Beach you KNOW where the Pavilion is!!! Long story <br/>
short, the kids got so involved trying to help they never noticed <br/>
Steve slipping the letterbox back into place...we got <br/>
directions...and we got the heck outta there!   Moral: If you don't <br/>
want to act like you own the place, just play plain dumb! <br/>

to keep all the little from paying any attention to what you're doing.<br/>
When we got there, my friend was wearing an 'Evolution' shirt (it's a <br/>
wrestling thing) and they ran up to him patting him on the back and things <br/>
and they were like "Randy Orton!" then I was like "Eh?" and they were like <br/>
"Kane!" (I have long-Kane-ish hair) and Darrell and I were confused so we <br/>
just played around with them like "yeah that's right, kid" and then just <br/>
ignored them and they ran off into the center of the park and started doing <br/>
wrestling moves on each other then looking at us for approval after each one.<br/>
So we got to the places where the side-walk and little pier/deck thing meet <br/>
up and I didn't know which side to look on so Darrell squatted down <br/>
pretending to tie his shoe at the right side while I stood thinking of how <br/>
to check the left.<br/>
Luckily it was to the right and we took the box and went onto the pier, <br/>
stamped (which wasn't easy and took about ten minutes as we has to use one <br/>
person as a lookout while the other stamped) and went to put it back.<br/>
We went to put it back and neither of us knew what to do so we stood at the <br/>
end of the pier wondering what to do when it hit me.  So I got my friend to <br/>
stand down closest to the hiding place and I stood in front of him with my <br/>
hand on the pier so that he was blocked off on all sides by pier, pond, and <br/>
Prynce.  While my hand was on the rail of the pier, I happened to drop my <br/>
camera bag (in hind-sight it wasn't a good move b/c I could have damaged <br/>
something) near this little corner where the hiding spot was and I was like <br/>
"Hey grab that for me please" so he squatted down and quickly slapped the <br/>
rock out of the way with one hand, grabbed for my bag with the other, and <br/>
tossed in the box and replaced the rock and gave me the bag.  **Big ups to <br/>
Darrell for the amazing slight-of-hand, BTW lol**<br/>
<br/>
So...  yeah.  I think it can be more fun to hide boxes in non-discreet <br/>
places.  This box had a ton of stamps in it and no one had damaged it to <br/>
date so it must have taken some clever blokes to work that out.  Anyone <br/>
else have any good stories about this box or ones like it?<br/>
