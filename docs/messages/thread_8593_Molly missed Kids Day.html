                    <html><body><p>Sorry about missing the kids day. Chickabirdie and myself did two hours on the American Cancer Society Walk for Life in Willimantic between 2am and 4 am. Molly and I have been letterboxing at least a few miles every day almost every day for the last week. The last days we were in Hampton. You will see the results of our planting soon. Molly would have loved kids day. She really loves kids (and adults). Not too good around a food table though. Maybe next time.....Chuck and Molly
