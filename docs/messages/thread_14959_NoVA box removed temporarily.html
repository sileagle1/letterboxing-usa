                    <div class="plaintext-content">Muskrat Ramble Letterbox at Riverbend Park in Fairfax County has been <br/>
removed temporarily. Many trees in the park came down in storms early this <br/>
summer, including part of the tree this box was in and just about all the trees <br/>
around it. I was able to get to it (and mighty surprised that it survived), but I <br/>
don't want anyone trying to bushwhack through the mess of limbs, trunks, <br/>
brush and logs. If I can, and if the Park employees leave the remains of its <br/>
tree, I will replace it therel. If not, I'll carve a new stamp, locate a new spot, and <br/>
Muskrat Ramble 2 will be a new find for everyone.<br/>
