Letterbox Name:  The Bur-Mil Letterbox<br/>
Date Hidden:  July 17, 2002<br/>
Location:  North Carolina, Guilford County, near the City of <br/>
Greensboro<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
On the north side of Greensboro is Bur-Mil Park.  Enter the park by <br/>
turning<br/>
left onto Bur-Mil Club Road and follow the road passed the clubhouse <br/>
to the<br/>
Pier.  Park at the circular parking lot at the end of the road.  Head <br/>
north<br/>
to the Fishing Pier.  Take some time to enjoy the view of Lake Brandt <br/>
before<br/>
heading northwest on Owl's Roost Trial, which follows along the lake's<br/>
shore.  It is a very quiet walk on a flat gravel trial used by bikers <br/>
and<br/>
runners.  Overhanging trees will keep you cool.  At the intersection <br/>
of the<br/>
Bur-Mil Big Loop Trial and Owl's Roost Trial, you can a wooden bridge<br/>
spanning over the lake.  More wonderful views of the lake can be seen <br/>
from<br/>
this bridge.  Head back to the trial intersection and travel south on <br/>
the<br/>
Bur-Mil Big Loop Trial.  Enjoy the walk through an open forest on a <br/>
winding<br/>
trial.  After passing two "very small" wooden bridges, look for the <br/>
first<br/>
big bridge (16 feet long).  A small trial bears south following <br/>
upstream.<br/>
At 100 single paces you will come to a gully on your left.  Follow <br/>
the gully<br/>
at 1000 for 50 paces being careful of the very old barbed wire <br/>
fence.  Now<br/>
turn left and head north at 200.  At 40 paces you will come to a <br/>
small gully<br/>
and at 68 total paces you will come to another telling you that you <br/>
are<br/>
close.  Continue counting for a total of 77 paces.  Look for a stump <br/>
(there<br/>
are a lot of them!).  Look for the stump that is deep into the <br/>
ground.  You<br/>
will have to dig a bit to find the letterbox.  To get back to the <br/>
trial,<br/>
head south for 86 paces and turn left.  At the break in the woods, <br/>
head at<br/>
800 passed the tennis and volleyball courts to get back to your car.  <br/>
The<br/>
terrain is easy and finding the letterbox should take 30 minutes.  <br/>
