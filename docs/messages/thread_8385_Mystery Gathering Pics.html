Wow...only 2 bucks for the pink stuff..costs me 5 for a sheet!!!<br/>
<br/>
While on the subject of rubber stamps...I'm gonna state my pet peeve!!!<br/>
<br/>
I've found some beautiful carved stamps...each one no matter who makes it,<br/>
is a work of art...but, unless it's mounted on a piece of wood, is<br/>
difficult<br/>
to get a great impression...<br/>
<br/>
I've tried mounting my hand carved stamps on wood and it's really easy...I<br/>
just got a piece of basswood from the art store...cut it to fit around the<br/>
stamp, and rubber cemented it on.<br/>
<br/>
It would make it easier for others to get a good impression for our<br/>
collections...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just had to share that there is a new Michael's store that just opened<br/>
near<br/>
&gt;my house today.  There is another one the same distance away in the other<br/>
&gt;direction, so now I have two to choose from.  Not to mention the JoAnn's<br/>
in<br/>
&gt;the middle.  I think I may suffer from Craft Overload any minute now!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The point of this revelation is that I went to the brand new Michaels<br/>
today<br/>
&gt;and I found a HUGE sheet of the pink stuff on clearance (in the brand new<br/>
&gt;store - go figure) for $2.00!  It was the only sheet there, so maybe<br/>
that's<br/>
&gt;why it was on clearance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Gotta love a bargain on letterboxing materials!<br/>

<br/>
How do you cut the wood?  I used a piece of basswood to mount<br/>
several stamps but found it very difficult to cut without the proper<br/>
"machines".  Might you be able to recommend some small and<br/>
inexpensive tool that would make cutting it easy?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help!<br/>

Wesley and I had a great time, and he was thrilled that everyone ate the<br/>
hotdogs he cooked! He harrassed Wanda and Pete will a million questions on<br/>
how they gather so many letterboxes, and we even found one with them. It is<br/>
so much fun to arrive at a gathering and greet strangers as friends and see<br/>
people we only know from the messages or the one other gathering we went<br/>
to. Also it's fun to exchange "hunting" stories after the initial frenzy of<br/>
exchanges cools down. Oh, and since people seemed to enjoy the cranberry<br/>
squares (Dan C!), I'll put that receipe in our new online files someday<br/>
soon.<br/>

As for wood to mount stamps, I simply asked a carpenter I knew for some<br/>
scraps of left over wood.  Now I happen to have connections with someone<br/>
who<br/>
works for a yacht maker,  so my stamps are now mounted on such things as<br/>
teak and mahogany, but I agree that a wood mount does make it easier.  I am<br/>
also going to start carrying a small piece of plywood or something in my<br/>
box<br/>
to use as a mini desk,  for those boxes that have larger stamps.  I have<br/>
trouble getting good impressions with those.  I did switch from carrying an<br/>
actual log book with me to carrying sheets of paper that I later mount in<br/>
an<br/>
album.  This way,  if I screw up the image I can stamp another and not have<br/>
to worry about ruining my log book.<br/>
Just an idea from a relative newbie<br/>

Subject: New box Bourne, MA<br/>
<br/>
The Bourne Bridge Letterbox<br/>
Location:  State: MA   County: Barnstable   Town: Bourne<br/>
       Cape Cod Canal Bikepath/Service road  - Mainland side<br/>
<br/>
Planted by: Tweety and Mr. Coon  10/02/02<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Easy on foot or on human powered wheels of your choice.<br/>
<br/>
Driving directions: From Rt. 195 east go south on Rt.25 towards the<br/>
Bourne Bridge. Turn off at the last exit before the bridge, go around<br/>
the rotary (past the landlocked tugboat) and,<br/>
<br/>
(1) if you want to cycle the canal   -  turn right into the town of<br/>
Buzzards Bay and continue along the main street until you see the<br/>
railroad lift bridge. The seven mile long bike path begins here. Turn<br/>
left into the parking lot for the Buzzards Bay Recreation Area. The<br/>
box is 2 miles east (north) along the bike path.<br/>
<br/>
or (2) if you want to walk to the box  -  you may want to go farther<br/>
around the rotary and follow Rt. 6  under the bridge to parallel the<br/>
canal. There are two scenic turnoffs on the right side of the road,<br/>
the second of which gives spectacular views of the canal, its valley,<br/>
and the glacial moraines that form the part of Cape Cod next to the<br/>
canal on the other side. At the bottom of the hill lies the Herring<br/>
Run Recreation Area in Bournedale. There are restroom facilities<br/>
here. If you park and walk from here the box is about 1.5 miles west<br/>
(south). Make sure you check out the herring run and there is also a<br/>
nature trail that leads from here.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to the box:<br/>
Near the 2 mile northward/ 5 mile southward mark look for a culvert<br/>
on the landward side of the path with a section of white fence behind<br/>
it, near this on the seaside edge of the path is a small<br/>
(2 or 3 inches in diameter) Corps of Engineers survey marker ( gps<br/>
269). The box hides behind the base of a utility pole with the number<br/>
270 on it in letters large enough to read from passing vessels. The<br/>
stamp is an on-site effort. Our motto is "Any stamp is good if it<br/>
gets people to go to places they might enjoy."<br/>
<br/>
The Cape Cod canal was completed in 1914 (it opened 17 days before<br/>
the Panama Canal), but it was conceived far earlier.  Miles Standish<br/>
and the Massachusetts Bay colonists contemplated digging a canal here<br/>
to connect two river valleys across this neck of land and President<br/>
George Washington was another early proponent of a canal here to<br/>
avoid British blockades. After several false starts in the late<br/>
1800's it was built by private company and then sold to the<br/>
government during WW I.  The canal has since been maintained by the<br/>
Army Corps of Engineers. It is the world's widest sea level canal.<br/>
The channel is maintained at 32 feet deep. The Bourne Bridge is 2385<br/>
long and 135 feet above the water.<br/>
<br/>
If you plan to ride the length of the path be advised that its often<br/>
quite breezy here so it might be well to take the wind into<br/>
consideration and start from whichever end you need to that day to<br/>
head into the wind so that the return trip will be easier. Most times<br/>
we've been there the wind has been blowing from Bourne (the west or<br/>
Buzzards Bay end) to Sagamore ( the east or Cape Cod Bay end).<br/>
If you want to go the Cape Cod end there are several good places to<br/>
park at the Sagamore end.<br/>
There are other boxes near the Scusset Beach end, including the<br/>
Sagamore Hill Letterbox and the Cape Cod Canal letterbox ( which is<br/>
listed as in Plymouth County ). If you continue on Rt 6 to the<br/>
Sagamore Bridge rotary ( intersection with Rt. 3 coming down from<br/>
Boston)  take the first turn past the bridge (Canal Street) off the<br/>
Sagamore Bridge rotary there's a parking lot right near the base of<br/>
the bridge. If you take the second turn ( Scusset Beach Road) from<br/>
the rotary  and follow it to the end it takes you to Scusset beach<br/>
and camping area, a place worth investigating anyway. Before the<br/>
campground there is a large parking area right next to the canal<br/>
where there are restroom facilities, snack bar and tables overlooking<br/>
the canal. The docks here are a popular fishing spot.<br/>
<br/>

Subject: New box  Sandwich, MA<br/>
<br/>
The Sagamore Hill Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Location:  State: MA   County: Barnstable   Town: Sandwich<br/>
       Scusset Beach Reservation<br/>
<br/>
Planted by: Tweety and Mr. Coon  10/13/02<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Easy 20 minute walk with a gentle grade but a great view.<br/>
<br/>
Driving directions: From Rt. 195 east go south on Rt.25 towards the<br/>
Bourne Bridge. Turn off at the last exit before the bridge, go around<br/>
the rotary (past the landlocked tugboat) and go around the rotary and<br/>
follow Rt. 6 under the bridge to parallel the canal. There are two<br/>
scenic turnoffs on the right side of the road, the second of which<br/>
gives spectacular views of the canal, its valley, and the glacial<br/>
moraines that form the part of Cape Cod next to the canal on the<br/>
other side. At the bottom of the hill lies the Herring Run Recreation<br/>
Area in Bournedale where there really is a  herring run and there is<br/>
also a nature trail that leads from here.<br/>
If you continue on Rt 6 to the Sagamore Bridge rotary ( intersection<br/>
with Rt. 3 coming down from Boston)  take the second turn paast the<br/>
bridge ( Scusset Beach Road) from the rotary  and follow it to the<br/>
end it takes you to Scusset beach and camping area, a place worth<br/>
investigating. Before the campground there is a large parking area<br/>
right next to the canal where there are restroom facilities, snack<br/>
bar and tables overlooking the canal. The docks here are a popular<br/>
fishing spot. Park here and walk across the street away from the<br/>
canal to find the trail entrance for Sagamore Hill.<br/>
<br/>
Sagamore Hill Coastal Artillery Camp. ? According to the signs there<br/>
native people once used this as a council gathering spot. Throughout<br/>
World War II this was the location of Battery C of the 241st Coast<br/>
Artillery. A level area just below the hilltop was the site of the<br/>
camps barracks and building and near the summit are the remains of<br/>
the gun mounts and ammunition storage bunkers. The hilltop commands a<br/>
sweeping view of Cape Cod Bay and the entrance to the canal. The 155<br/>
mm coastal guns located here had a range of 20 miles.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to the box:<br/>
Head up the right hand trail to the top of the hill. This leads up to<br/>
a small clearing remnant of the area where the camp was. Continue up<br/>
a trail to the left and after a very short and easy incline you'll<br/>
reach the ammo bunkers. To your right lies the first of the gun<br/>
mounts. Continue to the summit. Another gun mount lies on the<br/>
downslope beyond the top. Stop and read the Changes Through Time<br/>
sign. Do an about face and, looking almost due west ( 244 degrees by<br/>
our reckoning) spot a sickly multi-trunked cherry tree about 20 steps<br/>
away. Amidst the base of its trunks the box should lie under some<br/>
sticks and debris.<br/>
On your way back down the hill you may choose to follow the trail<br/>
(the old camp road) that branches to the left after the camp clearing<br/>
to have a different return route. If you do take the left hand trail<br/>
(a slightly longer walk back) be sure you bear to the right when you<br/>
come to a fork in that trail in order to return to the starting gate.<br/>
You'll know you're on the right track when you pass by a building and<br/>
some storage tanks enclosed in a fence.<br/>
There are several other letterboxes in the vicinity of the canal.<br/>
<br/>

Unfortunately, I don't have a my own website and had to rely on the file<br/>
section of the letterbox-usa group to post the photographs. Chuck's photos<br/>
are much more complete than mine. Enjoy them and his wonderful website as I<br/>
did.<br/>
Go to: http://groups.yahoo.com You may be asked to sign in. Do so and then<br/>
go to the letterbox-usa group, then to the "photos" section, then find the<br/>
Mystery Gathering photographs. Sort of like a virtual letterbox, eh?<br/>
LOL...I knew there would be problems with this....and that I would hear<br/>
grumblings about it. Sorry to be so technologically lame.<br/>

Subject: Got Wood?<br/>

I mount all my stamps because I use 1/4" thick medium only. I mount larger<br/>
stamps on 3/8" plywood and smaller ones on 1/4." With my stamps, I find<br/>
mounting does make a better image.<br/>
Michaels sells small pieces of 1/4" to 3/8' inch plywood in various widths<br/>
and lengths up to, I believe, 2' with nice clear, smooth and level surfaces<br/>
for stamping your image and then mounting it. I just purchased 3/8" X 12"<br/>
for around $2.50.<br/>
I LOVE your idea of carrying a small piece of plywood. I can see where this<br/>
would be useful in several different ways. There have been many times when<br/>
we have found a box in inclement weather and had to stand under our<br/>
umbrellas to sign in rather than find a spot to sit and enjoy our<br/>
surroundings. It is hard to stamp in some books with soft covers solidly<br/>
enough to get the whole image. A 4"x 6" piece of 1/4" luan plywood, which<br/>
is surprisingly solid, is lightweight and easily carried, would be perfect<br/>
to stabilize things.<br/>
I bought a small, inexpensive all-purpose handsaw at Home Depot to cut my<br/>
plywood blocks. I admit it takes persistence and patience to do this in a<br/>
somewhat straight line without something to hold the wood steady. Two<br/>
people are better. You will need sandpaper to smooth the edges.<br/>
Most small lumber yards will accommodate their customer requests to cut<br/>
hard wood purchased there into blocks for a nominal fee if not free. Custom<br/>
cabinet makers have tons of wood scraps in all kinds of interesting<br/>
hardwoods and shapes. They would probably give them away or sell you a bag<br/>
for almost nothing. Beware of pine and cherry though. They cup when exposed<br/>
to moisture. Plywood, maple, mahogany, teak, and are more stable, generally<br/>
in that order, IMHO.<br/>

asked a carpenter I knew for some<br/>
scraps of left over wood.  Now I happen to have connections with someone<br/>
who<br/>
works for a yacht maker,  so my stamps are now mounted on such things as<br/>
teak and mahogany, but I agree that a wood mount does make it easier.  I am<br/>
also going to start carrying a small piece of plywood or something in my<br/>
box<br/>
to use as a mini desk,  for those boxes that have larger stamps.  I have<br/>
trouble getting good impressions with those.  I did switch from carrying an<br/>
actual log book with me to carrying sheets of paper that I later mount in<br/>
an<br/>
album.  This way,  if I screw up the image I can stamp another and not have<br/>
to worry about ruining my log book.<br/>
Just an idea from a relative newbie<br/>

At the bottom of the hill lies the Herring<br/>Run Recreation Area in Bournedale. There are restroom facilities<br/>here. If you park and walk from here the box is about 1.5 miles west<br/>(south). Make sure you check out the herring run and there is also a<br/>nature trail that leads from here.<br/><br/>Directions to the box:<br/>Near the 2 mile northward/ 5 mile southward mark look for a culvert<br/>on the landward side of the path with a section of white fence behind<br/>it, near this on the seaside edge of the path is a small<br/>(2 or 3 inches in diameter) Corps of Engineers survey marker ( gps<br/>269). The box hides behind the base of a utility pole with the number<br/>270 on it in letters large enough to read from passing vessels. The<br/>stamp is an on-site effort. Our motto is "Any stamp is good if it<br/>gets people to go to places they might enjoy."<br/><br/>The Cape Cod canal was completed in 1914 (it opened 17 days before<br/>the Panama Canal), but it was conceived far earlier.  Miles Standish<br/>and the Massachusetts Bay colonists contemplated digging a canal here<br/>to connect two river valleys across this neck of land and President<br/>George Washington was another early proponent of a canal here to<br/>avoid British blockades. After several false starts in the late<br/>1800's it was built by private company and then sold to the<br/>government during WW I.  The canal has since been maintained by the<br/>Army Corps of Engineers. It is the world's widest sea level canal.<br/>The channel is maintained at 32 feet deep. The Bourne Bridge is 2385<br/>long and 135 feet above the water.<br/><br/>If you plan to ride the length of the path be advised that its often<br/>quite breezy here so it might be well to take the wind into<br/>consideration and start from whichever end you need to that day to<br/>head into the wind so that the return trip will be easier. Most times<br/>we've been there the wind has been blowing from Bourne (the west or<br/>Buzzards Bay end) to Sagamore ( the east or Cape Cod Bay end).<br/>If you want to go the Cape Cod end there are several good places to<br/>park at the Sagamore end.<br/>There are other boxes near the Scusset Beach end, including the<br/>Sagamore Hill Letterbox and the Cape Cod Canal letterbox ( which is<br/>listed as in Plymouth County ). If you continue on Rt 6 to the<br/>Sagamore Bridge rotary ( intersection with Rt. 3 coming down from<br/>Boston)  take the first turn past the bridge (Canal Street) off the<br/>Sagamore Bridge rotary there's a parking lot right near the base of<br/>the bridge. If you take the second turn ( Scusset Beach Road) from<br/>the rotary  and follow it to the end it takes you to Scusset beach<br/>and camping area, a place worth investigating anyway. Before the<br/>campground there is a large parking area right next to the canal<br/>where there are restroom facilities, snack bar and tables overlooking<br/>the canal. The docks here are a popular fishing spot.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Message: 10<br/>   Date: Mon, 14 Oct 2002 14:37:18 -0000<br/>   From: "tweety02769" &lt;tweety02769@yahoo.com&gt;<br/>Subject: New box  Sandwich, MA<br/><br/>The Sagamore Hill Letterbox<br/><br/>Location:  State: MA   County: Barnstable   Town: Sandwich<br/>       Scusset Beach Reservation<br/><br/>Planted by: Tweety and Mr. Coon  10/13/02<br/><br/>Difficulty: Easy 20 minute walk with a gentle grade but a great view.<br/><br/>Driving directions: From Rt. 195 east go south on Rt.25 towards the<br/>Bourne Bridge.

At the bottom of the hill lies the Herring Run Recreation<br/>Area in Bournedale where there really is a  herring run and there is<br/>also a nature trail that leads from here.<br/>If you continue on Rt 6 to the Sagamore Bridge rotary ( intersection<br/>with Rt. 3 coming down from Boston)  take the second turn paast the<br/>bridge ( Scusset Beach Road) from the rotary  and follow it to the<br/>end it takes you to Scusset beach and camping area, a place worth<br/>investigating. Before the campground there is a large parking area<br/>right next to the canal where there are restroom facilities, snack<br/>bar and tables overlooking the canal. The docks here are a popular<br/>fishing spot. Park here and walk across the street away from the<br/>canal to find the trail entrance for Sagamore Hill.<br/><br/>Sagamore Hill Coastal Artillery Camp. ? According to the signs there<br/>native people once used this as a council gathering spot. Throughout<br/>World War II this was the location of Battery C of the 241st Coast<br/>Artillery. A level area just below the hilltop was the site of the<br/>camps barracks and building and near the summit are the remains of<br/>the gun mounts and ammunition storage bunkers. The hilltop commands a<br/>sweeping view of Cape Cod Bay and the entrance to the canal. The 155<br/>mm coastal guns located here had a range of 20 miles.<br/><br/>Directions to the box:<br/>Head up the right hand trail to the top of the hill. This leads up to<br/>a small clearing remnant of the area where the camp was. Continue up<br/>a trail to the left and after a very short and easy incline you'll<br/>reach the ammo bunkers. To your right lies the first of the gun<br/>mounts. Continue to the summit. Another gun mount lies on the<br/>downslope beyond the top. Stop and read the Changes Through Time<br/>sign. Do an about face and, looking almost due west ( 244 degrees by<br/>our reckoning) spot a sickly multi-trunked cherry tree about 20 steps<br/>away. Amidst the base of its trunks the box should lie under some<br/>sticks and debris.<br/>On your way back down the hill you may choose to follow the trail<br/>(the old camp road) that branches to the left after the camp clearing<br/>to have a different return route. If you do take the left hand trail<br/>(a slightly longer walk back) be sure you bear to the right when you<br/>come to a fork in that trail in order to return to the starting gate.<br/>You'll know you're on the right track when you pass by a building and<br/>some storage tanks enclosed in a fence.<br/>There are several other letterboxes in the vicinity of the canal.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Message: 11<br/>   Date: Mon, 14 Oct 2002 14:48:12 -0000<br/>   From: "warrioringilead" &lt;warrioringilead@yahoo.com&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: Mystery Gathering Photos with Names<br/><br/>&gt; My husband is the Yachtsman.  It's funny that no one<br/>&gt; noticed the "Frugal Gourmet" resemblance at the gathering.<br/><br/>AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!<br/><br/>You did not read my posts!<br/><br/>Warrior Woman!<br/><br/><br/><br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Message: 12<br/>   Date: Mon, 14 Oct 2002 07:53:27 -0700 (PDT)<br/>   From: Alafair &lt;ms_alafair@yahoo.com&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: Mystery Gathering Pics<br/><br/><br/>Suzy,<br/>Unfortunately, I don't have a my own website and had to rely on the file<br/>section of the letterbox-usa group to post the photographs.

I mount larger<br/>stamps on 3/8" plywood and smaller ones on 1/4." With my stamps, I find<br/>mounting does make a better image.<br/>Michaels sells small pieces of 1/4" to 3/8' inch plywood in various widths<br/>and lengths up to, I believe, 2' with nice clear, smooth and level surfaces<br/>for stamping your image and then mounting it. I just purchased 3/8" X 12"<br/>for around $2.50.<br/>I LOVE your idea of carrying a small piece of plywood. I can see where this<br/>would be useful in several different ways. There have been many times when<br/>we have found a box in inclement weather and had to stand under our<br/>umbrellas to sign in rather than find a spot to sit and enjoy our<br/>surroundings. It is hard to stamp in some books with soft covers solidly<br/>enough to get the whole image. A 4"x 6" piece of 1/4" luan plywood, which<br/>is surprisingly solid, is lightweight and easily carried, would be perfect<br/>to stabilize things.<br/>I bought a small, inexpensive all-purpose handsaw at Home Depot to cut my<br/>plywood blocks. I admit it takes persistence and patience to do this in a<br/>somewhat straight line without something to hold the wood steady. Two<br/>people are better. You will need sandpaper to smooth the edges.<br/>Most small lumber yards will accommodate their customer requests to cut<br/>hard wood purchased there into blocks for a nominal fee if not free. Custom<br/>cabinet makers have tons of wood scraps in all kinds of interesting<br/>hardwoods and shapes. They would probably give them away or sell you a bag<br/>for almost nothing. Beware of pine and cherry though. They cup when exposed<br/>to moisture. Plywood, maple, mahogany, teak, and are more stable, generally<br/>in that order, IMHO.<br/>Linda a/k/a Alafair<br/>MARTEL &lt;martel@downeast.net&gt; wrote:As for wood to mount stamps, I simply<br/>asked a carpenter I knew for some<br/>scraps of left over wood.  Now I happen to have connections with someone<br/>who<br/>works for a yacht maker,  so my stamps are now mounted on such things as<br/>teak and mahogany, but I agree that a wood mount does make it easier.  I am<br/>also going to start carrying a small piece of plywood or something in my<br/>box<br/>to use as a mini desk,  for those boxes that have larger stamps.  I have<br/>trouble getting good impressions with those.  I did switch from carrying an<br/>actual log book with me to carrying sheets of paper that I later mount in<br/>an<br/>album.  This way,  if I screw up the image I can stamp another and not have<br/>to worry about ruining my log book.<br/>Just an idea from a relative newbie<br/>Memlili<br/><br/><br/>Yahoo!
