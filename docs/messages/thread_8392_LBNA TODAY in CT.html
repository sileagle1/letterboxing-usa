said enough is enough. I need to get out of this house and get my 100th box. I 
went out and got "Pumped Up" in Coventry! I got to share the fun with Pine Tree, 
Pine Cone, and Pine Needle who happened to be in the woods hunting the boxes in 
that area and were on their way to Pumped Up too! So I got to exchange as well.

stories of people trying to act casual while in pursuit of a box when others 
hiking approach. </span></div>
<div><span class="040581400-16102002">For 
example one day French Fox, Odilio, &amp; I were hunting a box in Mansfield 
in the middle of the woods. We were in the process of looking into a stump at 
the base of a large tree which we were sure held the treasure.  Picture it, 
one of us is reaching in to the stump all the way up to his shoulder. A 
couple with a large dog walk by and slow down to see what we are doing. We 
looked at each other and the first thing comes to mind is "That is one big 
tree!" To which French Fox replied "Sure is!" and Odilio asks 
</span></div>
<div><span class="040581400-16102002"> "What do you think it is?" We all just smiled at 
each other because it was just really just your average pine. That couple must 
have thought we were insane. </span></div>
<div><span class="040581400-16102002">Another day Odilio (sorry for telling your tale Odilio) 
was out on her own and a person working at the museum she was on the grounds of 
approached her and asked what she was doing. So she explained she was drawing. 
The women asked what she meant and she exclaimed "I am an artist!" and then 
she realized that she didn't have a pencil or any paper in her hands or her 
bag. The women looked at her funny and wandered away! </span></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">First off, we have trouble being subtle, because there are 7 of us, <br/>
and often the hound dog, too. Of course there's always a kid or two <br/>
milling around, throwing rocks in streams, etc. instead of focusing <br/>
on the task at hand, and the dog wants to greet folks and put the <br/>
attention on herself, so maybe this acts as cover, or at least <br/>
distraction, in itself.<br/>
As to meeting others on the trail, we never have. But one day at <br/>
Ringing Rocks in PA, we had found the box, and moved on to the <br/>
streambed where Wayne was looking for a geocache. Over by the falls <br/>
there was a couple with hiking boots, camera, backpacks, walking <br/>
sticks, and those outdoorsy-looking hats. They were right up against <br/>
the face of the rock, staring at something, burrowing in packs, <br/>
staring again, burrowing again. Very suspicious behavior. Of course <br/>
they looked just like letterboxers to me, but Wayne insisted that, <br/>
due to the hats!, they must be field biologists, as he works with <br/>
this sort of person all the time and knows them when he sees them. As <br/>
they continues on their way past us, they smiled broadly, greeted us, <br/>
and stopped to pet the dog (of course). Then, as I tried to sink into <br/>
the rocks in embarrasment, Wayne  up and asks, "Pardon my asking, but <br/>
are you field biologists?" "No," says they, "We just wear funny <br/>
hats." Turns out they'd found a huge caterpillar on the rocks, wanted <br/>
to photograph it with their brand-spanking-new digital camera, and <br/>
were burrowing in the bag to find the manual.<br/>
So be careful. Those folks on the trail might just be wearing funny <br/>
hats. Then again, they might really be field biologists.<br/>
