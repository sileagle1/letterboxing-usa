A hundred and a half years ago, had you been herding cattle up from Texas <br/>
to the westward moving railhead in Kansas, you'd have likely stopped along <br/>
the way at one of Jesse Chisholm's trading posts to take on a few supplies, <br/>
ask about the conditions further north and whatnot. He'd been trading with <br/>
the inhabitants of Indian Territory for some time.  At this particular <br/>
post, the oak/blackjack groves punctuating the tall-mid grass prairies of <br/>
central Oklahoma provided wood for fires and shelter from the cold northers <br/>
that blew in each winter.  Ole Jesse had picked a spot on the river that <br/>
had long been a place populated in the winter by Kiowa, Cheyenne and <br/>
Arapaho, and other buffalo hunting bands coming in off the plains to their <br/>
winter lodges.  As a result the area came to be called Council <br/>
Grove.  Names stick, even if the memory of why largely disappears. Standing <br/>
at Jesse's store, point your compass at 295 and find a way to cross the <br/>
river and get somewhere along that line.<br/>
<br/>
Places tend to never lose their usefulness I suppose, though Jesse's isn't <br/>
there anymore, folks still hold council among their friends here. Sometimes <br/>
when things don't work out, they speak harsh words and try to inscribe them <br/>
so indelibly that everyone else can feel their pain and know who caused <br/>
it.  Off to the south of the Council Grove box, councils are still held and <br/>
the words spoken sometimes take the form of art.  While we can read much of <br/>
it, I suppose in several hundred years, folks might lose that capacity and <br/>
see in them something more, or less, and ascribe to them mystery like we've <br/>
done at Three Rivers, Newspaper Rock, and Lascaux.  Oh, but on to the box. <br/>
Standing on that line you shot from Jesse's store, you want to triangulate <br/>
on the gatehouse that lets the N. Canadian flow on down through its red <br/>
muddy channel to the other pearls on this string.  That feature would be <br/>
seen at 356, if it weren't for the trees.<br/>
<br/>
Find the twin posts, though, stand between them and follow the needle <br/>
N.  Wriggling into this grove, you'll find that it would only shelter only <br/>
a pretty intimate council.<br/>
