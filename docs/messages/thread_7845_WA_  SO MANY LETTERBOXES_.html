couple years in Washington State.  I LOVE IT!!!  Now if I could just get<br/>
up there to hunt for some...<br/>
<br/>
I'm very excited and intrigued by Fudrick's Cowlitz Falls letterbox.  I<br/>
have never seen or been to the park and campground there, so maybe I'll<br/>
have to head up  that way and go camping.  That is closer than where<br/>
most of the letterboxes are in Washington.  I know someone, Eliza B.,<br/>
maybe???  placed at Ape Cave and Lava Canyon.  Those are must gets, as<br/>
well.  Preferably this year before the snow keeps everyone out (though<br/>
snow shoeing around Ape Caves could be an option!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all Washington Letterboxers for giving this sport life in a<br/>
state that has always had excellent potential!!!  Great job to all!!!<br/>
<br/>

I noticed (for the first time) the Cowlitz Falls sign next-to-last <br/>
trip over White Pass.  Checked it out, looked interesting.  The camp <br/>
ground was closed (on a Tuesday afternoon?), looked inside, looked <br/>
very nice.  The Day Use was great.  Many picnic tables, trees, great <br/>
river, a very serence place.  Probably hectic when the fish are <br/>
biting.  If you go soon, take your blackberry bucket, didn't look <br/>
like anyone had been picking there yet.  Had to sample them, very <br/>
ripe and sweet.  Would make great blackberry jelly!<br/>
