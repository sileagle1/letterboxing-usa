A postal letterbox is one that is mailed through the "regular" mail to<br/>
people.  It is a lot of fun to get them in your mailbox!  Especially when it<br/>
is not boxing weather around here.<br/>
<br/>
They typically contain a stamp and log book, so the stamping-in process the<br/>
same. (How you count them is entirely up to you--this is a subject of great<br/>
debate.  SOme count them as finds; some count them  seperately.  I simply<br/>
don't count them and just enjoy the stamp) You then would mail them on to<br/>
the next person on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Some have closed lists--you have to get on when they are annonced.  OThers<br/>
have open lists--people are added periodically.  Either way, if you watch<br/>
the LBNA list, you wills ee periodic postings.<br/>
<br/>
Purple Iris's quoted post refers tot he fact that Nautilus apparently is on<br/>
a month-long vacation and a couple postal boxes are piling up. Whoops!<br/>
Being on the list for at least one of those, I am disappointed to have to<br/>
wait.  But, I am sure it will be worth it.<br/>

I too am on the list, I was just wondering if the remark ment that<br/>
this PLB was dead, lost, or something. I dont keep up on the talk list<br/>
but I would like to find more of these PLBs' It is a great way to keep<br/>
in the swing of things. I cant get out on the trail very often but the<br/>
trip to the post office is one I make every day.<br/>
