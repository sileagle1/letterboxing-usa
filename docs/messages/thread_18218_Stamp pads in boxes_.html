either not the colors we want or a big mess. I think by now, most letterboxers <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree 100% Doublesaj.  Of the many letterboxes that we have found that<br/>
contained an ink pad in them, none of them were of any use anymore except<br/>
for the brand new boxes we were first finders on.  Otherwise, the pads had<br/>
dried out and become completely unusable and we, like you, carry our own<br/>
inks and markers to make a unique and special stamp of each one we find.<br/>
<br/>
So, in my NOT so humble personal opinion, I'd rather not see an inkpad in a<br/>
letterbox, it is only a waste in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Team Rayvenhaus does not include an inkpad in any of the letterboxes that we<br/>
place or maintain, though we do include a pen for logbook marking and such<br/>
as we've found that a pen keeps longer.<br/>

Well, I may be a minority, but I like when there's a pad in the box.   It <br/>
lets me stamp the placer's image in the color THEY chose to express it in, rather <br/>
than just whatever color I happened to be carrying.   <br/>
<br/>
But I also live in a place where it never freezes, so that makes it easier to <br/>
keep pads in boxes.<br/>

Yes!   When I get around to hiding my pink ribbon letterbox, it'd be kind of <br/>
weird for people to have to stamp it in some other color!   And I carefully <br/>
picked an "Army green" for my heavy artillery box (which has since gone missing, <br/>
darn it all!)<br/>
<br/>
I carry pads in the colors each of my family members has chosen for our <br/>
personal stamps, but I don't want to have to tote a whole spectrum around!<br/>

with the ink pads, or grew tired of buying them, then I'd stop<br/>
including them.  <br/>
<br/>
Some stamps seem to need a certain color and this is the primary<br/>
reason we include a pad in the box.  For example I could never put a<br/>
pine tree stamp with hot pink ink (:-D).  Another reason we include<br/>
the ink pad is convience for the finder.  <br/>
<br/>
We carry a different color ink for each personal stamp, including the<br/>
dog's. I find that the longer we're at it and more experienced we<br/>
become, more colors end up in the backpack.  Probably by summer we'll<br/>
include markers like LePlume (sp).<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have heard from many, many different people over time is<br/>
including a pencil like the little ones used in golf.  The question<br/>
that always nags at me (and I know it's a silly one) is what about<br/>
sharpening it?  When they can no longer write, is there a pencil<br/>
sharpening fairy?  I'm sorry if this is a dumb question to some, but I<br/>
never would think to carry a pencil sharpener, in fact I've used<br/>
mechanical pencils for at least the last 17 years and would really<br/>
have to dig around to find a sharpener.  This is why we include a pen,<br/>
even though the ink isn't archival and may fade.  For the well<br/>
maintained boxes I bet the pencils are kept sharp, but not all boxes<br/>
are carefully tended.<br/>
<br/>
Just asking.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; Well, I may be a minority, but I like when there's a pad in the<br/>
&gt; box.   It lets me stamp the placer's image in the color THEY chose <br/>
&gt; to express it in, rather than just whatever color I happened to be<br/>
&gt; carrying.   <br/>
<br/>
*chuckle*  But if they don't put an ink pad in the letterbox, then <br/>
they clearly didn't "choose" a color to express their stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
I always like the idea that everyone has the same stamp, but <br/>
slightly different versions of it and was rather surprised the first <br/>
time I heard someone say that liked having stamp pads included for <br/>
the very reason you suggested.  The color is a part of the image <br/>
should be 'preserved' across multiple finders.<br/>
<br/>
I understand there's no right or wrong in this case, but I'm partial <br/>
to the variety of different ways people will color the same stamp.  <br/>
I like to see the unique colors or color combinations that people <br/>
have used on my stamps that caused some VERY cool effects I never <br/>
even thought of originally.<br/>
<br/>
One example was my Silver Falls series, which I planted before I <br/>
discovered the wonderful use of markers and multiple colors on a <br/>
single stamp.  They're nice stamps, but not especially impressive, I <br/>
thought.  That was until I saw what someone else had done with them <br/>
by coloring the different parts of the stamp different colors.  <br/>
WOW!  The stamps just POPPED!  I wanted to go out and restamp them <br/>
again in my logbook using multiple colors!<br/>
<br/>
There was another stamp I carved for Heceta Head, which was a really <br/>
great stamp that was specifically designed to use multiple colors.  <br/>
For test stamps, I used a single color (it's quicker), but the final <br/>
image I used multiple colors and it turned out great.  Later I saw <br/>
someone who had found the letterbox later, and they used a single <br/>
color for the stamp after multiple colors had been used.  It created <br/>
this VERY cool effect where it gave the whole stamp almost an old-<br/>
time look like you'd see on a poster a hundred years ago.  The whole <br/>
image had a certain tone of color, but the individual colors beld <br/>
through as well.  You'd have to see the image to understand, but it <br/>
was far more amazing than I had done with a single color or multiple <br/>
colors.  It was a blend of the two I had never thought to do before.<br/>
<br/>
So even when I've planted a stamp or already found a stamp, I still <br/>
delight in seeing what others were able to do with it.  So everyone <br/>
has a the same stamp--the content--but 'reads' it differently <br/>
keeping it unique and special.  A blending of letterboxers.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not really trying to talk you out of including ink pads with <br/>
your letterboxes with this diatribe, though.  I've even deliberately <br/>
avoided using ink pads that were included with a letterbox on more <br/>
than one occasion because I thought I could do a better color job.  <br/>
(Sometimes it works out, other times, it doesn't.  *shrug*)<br/>

Oh my, what would Martha say to that?<br/>
Hmmm, I think it's quite handy for (some) stamps, say my baxter woods series, <br/>
where you could have a different color for the leaves as they change chlorophyll <br/>
pigment through the season.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We carry a different color ink for each personal stamp, including the<br/>
&gt; dog's. I find that the longer we're at it and more experienced we<br/>
&gt; become, more colors end up in the backpack.  Probably by summer we'll<br/>
&gt; include markers like LePlume (sp).<br/>
<br/>
Since day one I've rocked the phyto stamp with hand-colored markers. I love the <br/>
colors and I probably carry about 20 different ones, as most people who have met <br/>
me at a gathering can surely speak of (!) I think some patience is required to <br/>
coordinate these items, but they're well worth the effort and you can be sure you <br/>
always get the color you want without a mess in the box.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; One thing I have heard from many, many different people over time is<br/>
&gt; including a pencil like the little ones used in golf.  The question<br/>
&gt; that always nags at me (and I know it's a silly one) is what about<br/>
&gt; sharpening it?  <br/>
<br/>
Does thou not carry thy own personal sharpener? <br/>

Dick Blick online has a fantastic one that has a little screw on end so that you don't <br/>
spill little shavings all over the place: http://www.dickblick.com/zz214/22/<br/>
products.asp?param=0&amp;ig_id=6312 (prismacolor is the brand name)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This is why we include a pen,<br/>
&gt; even though the ink isn't archival and may fade.  For the well<br/>
&gt; maintained boxes I bet the pencils are kept sharp, but not all boxes<br/>
&gt; are carefully tended.<br/>

That's why I like pens better as well.  And perhaps ink isn't <br/>
archival-safe and may fade, it's been my experience that pencils <br/>
will fade far quicker than pens.<br/>
<br/>
On the one or two occasions I've wanted to use a dull pencil that <br/>
was in a box (because I forgot my own pen), I've sharpened it using <br/>
rocks or concrete or whatever is available.  Rub that pencil down to <br/>
a point.  If someone carries a pocketknife, there's also the option <br/>
of whittling it down to a point.<br/>

tactics.  =)<br/>

  Frankly, we use our own special pens and stamp pads to color the stamps we <br/>
  find before stamping in our journals. We find that stamp pads in boxes are <br/>
  either not the colors we want or a big mess. I think by now, most letterboxers <br/>
  carry their own so I really don't think you need to go to the expense of placing <br/>
  stamp pads in boxes. <br/>

<br/>
Hmmm, might be interesting to have a box where everyone stamped their own<br/>
impression of the box stamp into the log, so they'd all be together in a<br/>
"collection."<br/>
<br/>
I still see the color choice as part of the original creation, though.   At<br/>
least in most cases.<br/>
<br/>
I remember finding a Celtic/Irish series once.   I was so disappointed that<br/>
they didn't have pads, and I didn't have a green one with me.   I had to<br/>
stamp<br/>
them in black, and it was just WRONG!<br/>

I'm with you, Catbead!  Troublesome ink pads in the wild?  I have 3 <br/>
large dogs, 4 persnickity cats, 2 daughters and one largely <br/>
uncooperative husband.  Troublesome ink pads are the least of my <br/>
worries!<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I don't have a strong opinion either way.  If I can fit <br/>
an ink pad in the box I include one.  If not, I warn folks to BYOP.  <br/>
If I do include one, I could care less whether you use it - just <br/>
have fun and box!<br/>

&gt; Frankly, we use our own special pens and stamp pads to color the <br/>
stamps we <br/>
&gt; find before stamping in our journals. We find that stamp pads in <br/>
boxes are <br/>
&gt; either not the colors we want or a big mess. I think by now, most <br/>
letterboxers <br/>

<br/>
  Maybe it's my lack of sleep, but this has me rolling on the floor. <br/>
  Are these wild ink pads, un-broken ink pads to be lassoed, are there<br/>
