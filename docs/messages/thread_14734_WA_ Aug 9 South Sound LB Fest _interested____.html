                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi fellow Puget Sound letterboxers out there (and any other <br/>
letterboxers who might be interested)!<br/>
<br/>
Are any other Puget Sound letterboxers interested in attending a <br/>
South Sound Letterboxing Fest o/a the morning of 9 Aug 03?<br/>
<br/>
***SOUTH SOUND LETTERBOXING FEST  9 AUG 03***<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of a quick get-together somewhere in the South Sound <br/>
area (Olympia/Tacoma area) with a focus of exchanging signature <br/>
stamps/hitchhikers/event letterboxes you might have hanging around <br/>
your house, hitchhikers you want to launch to the 4 winds, etc.  <br/>
Wouldn't need to plant any boxes specific to the event--just an <br/>
opportunity to meet with fellow letterboxers and exchange stamps, <br/>
carving ideas, clue writing hints, etc for a couple of hours.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if there is any interest out there--I've heard from a <br/>
couple of folks off-line already--just want to know if there are <br/>
others out there.  The primary 'gathering' location I was thinking <br/>
of was Tumwater's Historical Park just off of I-5 in the <br/>
Olympia/Tumwater area.  It offers a great picnic/playground area <br/>
with running water &amp; flushing toilets!!!  ;)  If there is enough <br/>
interest &amp; you want to extend the length of the event, we could <br/>
stretch it into a potluck style picnic.  This park is quite <br/>
centrally located to MANY, MANY, MANY letterboxes in the Olympia <br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
***TUMWATER HISTORICAL PARK, TUMWATER, WA***<br/>
<br/>
Another possible meeting location would be Pt Defiance Park in <br/>
Tacoma but it is often QUITE busy on the weekends with only one spot <br/>
with a playground (near the back entrance to the zoo).<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know (or, better, yet, post your comments on the board <br/>
so others get the feel for the number of interested letterboxers out <br/>
there):<br/>
<br/>
1.  If you are interested in attending.<br/>
2.  Whether you are able to attend on 9 Aug 03 (approx 0900-1000 <br/>
start time and ending whenever), if not--another more feasible <br/>
date/time for your group.<br/>
3.  # in your party<br/>
<br/>
This is also a great time to invite your friends who might be <br/>
interested in letterboxing.  What a great time to start the hobby <br/>
with a logbook full of exchanges!!!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to here from many of you out there soon.<br/>

The "South Sound Summer Letterboxing Fest"<br/>
<br/>
         ********<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, 9 August 2003<br/>
1000-until whenever you want to leave<br/>
<br/>
Tumwater Historical Park (Olympia area)<br/>
777 Simmons Rd SW<br/>
Tumwater, WA<br/>
<br/>
(approx Exit 102 off of I-5)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
          *******<br/>
<br/>
Bring yourself, your letterboxing partners, your signature stamps, <br/>
your logbooks, any hitchhiker letterboxes you'd like <br/>
to 'launch'/exchange, event letterboxes, anything else you think <br/>
would be of interest to other area letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
The event would focus on exchanging signature stamps with other <br/>
LBers, getting to know other cool people active in the hobby, <br/>
gaining insight/tips &amp; exchanging ideas on various aspects of the <br/>
hobby from carving stamps, to researching locations/topics for boxes <br/>
to writing clues &amp; securing permission for planting letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
***A Special Thank You goes out to Fudrick for creating the event <br/>
stamp on such short notice!!! Thank you one thousand fold!!!***<br/>
<br/>
A potluck will ensue sometime during the event.  If you'd like to <br/>
participate in the 'feasting' festivities bring enough food/drink to <br/>
share that would cover the folks in your party and the appropriate <br/>
plates/utensils necessary for your dish/group.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PARK AMENITIES:  Picnic tables, excellent playground, water <br/>
fountains &amp; restrooms with running water!!!  Great view of the <br/>
Deschutes Falls and the Old Olympia Brewery.  There is also lake <br/>
access for kayaks/canoes, horseshoe stakes and short nature trails <br/>
in the area for anyone who might be interested.  This park is <br/>
centrally located to several existing letterboxes in the region <br/>
(several dozen if you do your homework prior to the event).<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to meeting many of the new letterboxers in the <br/>
region and catching up with the 'veterans' out there.  Long distance <br/>
traveling letterboxers are more than welcome to join us.  If you <br/>
need assistance in finding lodging/campgrounds, etc. in the area, <br/>
don't hesitate to contact us.<br/>
<br/>
See you on Saturday!!!<br/>
