&gt; Hi<br/>
&gt; We emailed you some clues to a new letterbox we put in<br/>
&gt; Arches national park outside Moab, Utah. Did you get the<br/>
&gt; clues? I haven't seen it posted yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Thank you Terri and Sky for the beautiful location for the letterbox<br/>
&gt; at the Puako Petroglyph park on the Big Island of Hawaii.  My wife,<br/>
&gt; Elizaeth, and I hiked out there today to find that we were the second<br/>
&gt; people since August to have stamped your book.  We also found a<br/>
&gt; hitchhiker....placed by Don and Gwen on 5/26/01 originally at Friendly<br/>
&gt; Ghost Ranch (where??) and carried to Hawaii by Mick and Terri and now<br/>
&gt; on its way to Pasadena, CA when we leave the Big Island.  This is our<br/>
&gt; initial foray into the world of letterboxing....Clement &amp; Elizabeth<br/>

&gt; Hi Nisa,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nice to hear from you. I'm glad you still are on the list, either if<br/>
neither<br/>
&gt; one of us is posting too much any more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'm still teaching sixthgrade in Vermont, busy with job and family. I work<br/>
&gt; at posting clues on the website, but don't get out hunting much -<br/>
certainly<br/>
&gt; not during the winter. I do hope to catch up a little this summer with<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; of the boxes in northern NE. Maybe revisit your 'white pearl' in Sheiling<br/>
&gt; Forest, which was one of my first.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Best wishes,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tom<br/>

&gt; &gt; Just waxing a little nostalgic right now as it'll be 4 years ago this<br/>
&gt; &gt; Memorial Day weekend that I set out to find my first letterbox.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don't see many of the names that used to post then anymore.  The ones<br/>

&gt; &gt; Klink...even Daniel Servatius (anyone remember him??  I know he left<br/>

surprise is the biggest part of the HH. It took me 2 years of boxing to find<br/>
my first last weekend and I was one happy camper...  Even more so because it<br/>
was a Drew Clan box..<br/>

&gt; Not necessarily contradicting anything that has been said in this<br/>
&gt; thread -- but on the matter of HH secrecy/disclosure, we should<br/>
&gt; respect the wishes of the person who created it, if those wishes<br/>

&gt;<br/>

&gt; Subject: Revised Letterbox Series in British Columbia<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have modified the Derby Reach Park letterbox series and actually<br/>
created two separate series now. Just a couple words of advice, watch out<br/>
for the nettles, as they are everywhere and we also suggest that a pair of<br/>
gloves and a flashlight might be useful. The series are as follows:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Derby Reach Series:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Edge Farm Trail letterbox<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Degree of Difficulty: Easy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cross the border into British Columbia at any one of the Lower Mainland<br/>
border points with Washington State. You now want to seek out the Greater<br/>
Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) park known as "Derby Reach"<br/>
&gt; For those of you who would like it to be a little easier, we have attached<br/>
the website map of the<br/>
&gt; park.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; http://www.gvrd.bc.ca/services/parks/pdf/webmaps/Derbymap.pdf<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From the Edgewater Bar Site, begin at campsite #38 and walk east towards<br/>
the trail entrance.<br/>
&gt; Travel approximately 100 paces along the path until you get to the rotting<br/>
stump, and look for a large tree on the right with three trunks, across from<br/>
the Cedar Grove.<br/>
&gt; Take 19 paces more and on the left you will see the last cedar tree in the<br/>
collection.<br/>
&gt; Scout out the interior of the tree down and low.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. Wood box  Letterbox<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Degree of Difficulty: Easy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Leaving the Cedar Grove, pause to gaze skyward and admire the giant on<br/>
your right. Then proceed to the iron gate. Ponder your good fortune at this<br/>
point. Pass on through the gate and take a stroll along the river until you<br/>
reach Anthea's Panorama. 134 degrees magnetic will get you what you seek.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. Gill-Netter Letterbox<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Degree of Difficulty: Moderate<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From Anthea's Panorama, jump back onto the trail and continue in an<br/>
easterly direction. The view will be on your left. As you leave the river's<br/>
edge, the path takes you into the forest and them along the roadside. Feel<br/>
free to stop along the way and observe the many fishing holes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After you pass a heavily guarded part of the trail, observe! You are<br/>
looking for the Edgewater Trail sign. Once upon it, step down from the<br/>
marker, but don't overlook the Danger!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One may compare your hunt to that of one for a needle in a haystack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. Fort to Fort Trail letterbox<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Degree of Difficulty: Easy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (Please note this letterbox is located close to the trail. Use caution<br/>
when removing and watch for trail visitors)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you still have the energy, pick up the trail and continue to the East.<br/>
Soon you will chance upon the cairn that marks the spot of the original<br/>
Fort. Stop to admire it, and consider the marvellous history of the Hudson's<br/>
Bay Company and their Trading Post of Fort Langley.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From the Cairn across the road from the parking lot, take 50 paces to the<br/>
right; here is the beginning of the dual use trail and the Fort-to-Fort<br/>
passage. Follow the split rail fence through the bramble patch into a<br/>
clearing. Danger is on the left as you may see glimpses of the river beyond.<br/>
Up a little hill into the forest you will see the twins on the curve. 19<br/>
paces on your left you will find me in the roots underneath.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Alternative Clue. (For those not into walking too far).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From the entrance to Edgewater Bar Site of the Derby Reach Park (GVRD -<br/>
see above) proceed east along Allard Crescent until you reach the site of<br/>
the original Fort at Fort Langley (marked as the Heritage Site on the map)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; HOUSTON TRAIL SERIES<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. The Homestead Letterbox<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Degree of Difficulty: Medium<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From the entrance to Edgewater Bar Site of the Derby Reach Park (GVRD -<br/>
see above) proceed east along Allard Crescent until you reach the site of<br/>
the original Fort at Fort Langley (marked as the Heritage Site on the map)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those of you who would like it to be a little easier, we have attached<br/>
the website map of the<br/>
&gt; Park.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; http://www.gvrd.bc.ca/services/parks/pdf/webmaps/Derbymap.pdf<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This time, from the parking lot, follow the signs along the gravel walkway<br/>
and dirt road to the beginning of the Houston Trail. At the fork stay right.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Past the pond/marsh and continue on through the forest. Follow the trail<br/>
as it loops around and heads South East past the large fallen tree and up a<br/>
little rise,. Stand between the two stumps. Count 16 paces to find a side<br/>
path that runs backwards up the hill. To the peak and the tabletop fern<br/>
forest on your right, continue on. Keep your eyes pealed for the hairy<br/>
one-armed bandit who stands in the way. 61 degrees magnetic from the armpit,<br/>
spot a cluster of four towers standing tall. (A 30-metre glance). The<br/>
basement is my home.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. The Coyote Letterbox<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Degree of Difficulty: Easy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Back on the trail again and head roughly Northwest. Come to an<br/>
intersection of paths and head up as soon as you can. Up, up, up under the<br/>
crossed trees you will pass. Follow the trail and watch for the slanted,<br/>
uprooted tree. Stand below it and follow your nose at 260 degrees magnetic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. The Gold Rush Letterbox<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Degree of Difficulty: Easy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It's back to the trail, and continue on under the slanted tree. Keeping to<br/>
the right at all time, follow the ridge, they gully is on your left.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You will leave the gully ridge as you go right and enter into a thick<br/>
brush. Continue on. Decide whether to take the high road or the low. If you<br/>
get that sinking feeling you will have in your sight what you seek at 250<br/>
degrees magnetic. Check all around!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. The Beaver Letterbox (Bonus box)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Degree of Difficulty: Easy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only way out is to continue to follow the trail. Head 170 degrees<br/>
magnetic, and follow the trail to a fork in the road. Go either way, as long<br/>
as you head down. Once back on the main trail, go either left or right. You<br/>
have come to the end of the Houston Series. Right will take you back to the<br/>
parking lot. Left will too, only longer. There is a bonus letterbox if you<br/>
go left. Enjoy the sights, sounds and smells of the lush temperate rain<br/>
forest that you are in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The trail will lead you to the other parking lot on the opposite of the<br/>
park to the main lot. Move through the lot and rejoin the trail yet again on<br/>
the left.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The trail will be lots of ups and downs. At one part you will come to a<br/>
major intersection of trails. You will go right to seek the bonus box.<br/>
Continue along and gaze upon the Beaver dam. Look for a twin and a third.<br/>
Ponder the view. Sometimes you will see people and turtles alike observing<br/>
the surroundings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From the twins and a third, look for the giant nearby and search the<br/>
albino below.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Alternative Clue. (For those not into walking too far).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From the Houston Trail parking lot, go right along the road, watching for<br/>
a yellow gate. From the gate you will see the beaver dam. 34 paces towards<br/>
the giant and the albino will get you what you seek. Don't forget to admire<br/>
the view.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck, and keep in mind you have to be observant. We look forward to<br/>
hearing how you like these.<br/>

&gt; Hi there...most of you don't know me...but some of you might! I posted the<br/>
&gt; letterbox on Mt. Neahkanie, and several in Oxbow park.<br/>
<br/>
Hey Cara!<br/>
<br/>
I remember you &amp; have a stamp from one of your Oxbow boxes.  Glad to see you<br/>
are still around!<br/>
