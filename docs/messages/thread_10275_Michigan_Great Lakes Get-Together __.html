I know there was some talk of a Michigan gathering last summer, right <br/>

I am very interested in a MI gathering!  Have done some boxing here in SE Mich., planted a box up near Alpena, have other boxes in the thought process.  Have also done two large "event" letterboxing series at our stamp club's annual rubber stamp camp weekend (9 boxes in our first event, 13 boxes in our second event).<br/>
<br/>
So, keep me posted!  I had a very packed schedule last summer and fall, between work travel and stamp conventions.  Maybe we have enough lead time now to consider dates that won't conflict with some of the stamp conventions.<br/>
<br/>
Count me in!<br/>

<div>I, too, would be interested!  I'm over between 
Flint and Lapeer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Most of the questions would be about where the 
location of the event would be. I have a pop-up camper and would have no 
hesitation camping for the weekend if camping was available, hence, would be 
willing to drive further. If camping was not available, then I would say 
probably 2 hrs max for me personally.</div>
