<br/>
A special series will be planted for the event!<br/>
<br/>
Bring your own picnic lunch and eat while taking in the views of the Penobscot River, Verona Island and Bucksport!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and one more thing! Make sure to bring a flashlight or headlamp. The fort has some underground tunnels that are not lit up.<br/>
<br/>
I have 3 traveling event stamps coming in from across the country! Plus, I finally carved an event series of my own that will be making it's debut at the Fort!<br/>
