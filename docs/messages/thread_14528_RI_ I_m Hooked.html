We met Scout last nite while he was checking on one of the boxes<br/>
he planted. We weren't able to exchange as he didn't have his stamp <br/>
with him.  We saw your stamp in Diamond Hill as well!<br/>
Glad to have someone near where we live putting out boxes.<br/>
We live in Taunton, Mass and have been getting some boxes<br/>
out in our area - maybe you can check them out, too.<br/>
"No ______ Sherlock" is less than a half hour away from Cumberland.<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for visiting my letterboxes, there will be more coming soon.<br/>
I'll be white water canoeing &amp; Rafting in Maine all of next week, but hope to try my luck in your neck of the woods. <br/>
<br/>
May our paths cross<br/>

There is a gathering in Maine on the 9th of August, <br/>
We are attending (actually camping there for the weekend)<br/>
This would be an excellent opportunity for you to meet<br/>
many letterboxers that are planning to come from CT, RI<br/>
and MA as well as Maine. <br/>
Have a great time white water rafting - I am jealous.<br/>
