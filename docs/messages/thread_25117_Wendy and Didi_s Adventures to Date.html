                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Now that I have a Letterboxing buddy, her name is Didi (my neighbor and walking partner), I have been going hunting and catching up on what's been going on in this area (I live in Torrance.<br/>
SoCal).<br/>
<br/>
Our first hunt was a Kelsung box that survives in a hostile place where my friends Don and Gwen use to have box(es?) (which I found years ago, very cute stamps) but were picked up by authorities.  We thought we made all the correct lefts and rights but we really got creative and thought that the box was... well lets just say it was stinky there and I didn't want to look any deeper.  We were way off track so we will try again when there is a cooler day.<br/>
<br/>
Aug.1st we went to Andy's Box.  Lucky I have a buddy who is more nimble than I.  She found the box and we stamped-in.  YEA! Didi's first find! <br/>
<br/>
Same day we went to find Rails to Trails.  We went the wrong direction the first try and found a spot that seemed to fit the description and went looking for it.  It was obvious that someone was there before us (I think the same morning) who had made the same mistake BUT they certainly don't follow the concept of LEAVE NO TRACE.  They had broken large pieces off of the Jade bush that was there and did a fair amount of tramping on other areas of the Jade bush.  If YOU are reading this, knock it OFF.  You left a mess.  Luckily that Jade bush will recover<br/>
but I would hate to think what you may do in a more sensitive area.  Back to our adventure... we realized out mistake and found the box, stamped in and replaced it without being seen (amazing for a Saturday morning).  YEA Didi's 2nd Find!<br/>
<br/>
On our way home we stopped to look for a Manhattan Beach box, Sweet Caroline's "And the Oscar Goes To...".  We didn't find it, but we think we found the correct spot so it may be missing.  I'm a dope and didn't notice when I was preparing for the day, that there was another box in the same area that we could have looked for... Next time.<br/>
<br/>
Today we went for another Kelsung box, the remaining box in the San Pedro Series.  I think we have bad news... but first the adventure and bravery.... I was approaching the sight (I was the nimbelist of the two of us today) from the easiest access, the side, and as I got close, looking up from my feet to check my path there was a 4 foot long snake coming my way.  REALLY coming right up to me!! I stopped... it stopped (only 2 feet away mouth open) and as I scanned it's body to the tail looking for a rattle it turned around and went back into it's home (hole) in the hill a foot from the marker for the box location.  BIG SNAKE!  No rattle but a triangular head, I've got to look it up to see what kind of snake it was.  Anyway I looked for the box (No I didn't run away) and couldn't find it.  I think I saw where it might have been but it wasn't there.  Happily the snake stayed in it's home while I was looking around.  Phew.<br/>
<br/>
On our way home we were going to stop at the store so we went a little out of our way and since that took us by the San Vincente Lighthouse we went looking for my nemisis box belonging to Gwen and Don.  I thought for sure I wouldn't have any trouble finding it again because last time was so memorable.  On my 4th attempt to find it (yes I said 4th, where on the 3rd attempt I did a couple of summersaults down the hill with my good reflex camera (yes it was back in the days of film) amazingly tucked in, not a scratch on it or me, but if I had continued to fall...<br/>
well who knows what would have happened to me. Yes this is when I use to box alone), with Gwen and Don to say "you are getting warmer, no colder, warmer... keep going", I finally go to stamp-in.  Well today I made the same mistakes as try #3, without the summersaults, and couldn't find it.  BUuuuut Didi, she who is determined, found it!!  So I got to stamp-in all these years later and DIdi got her 3rd find.  YEA!!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the novel, but hope you enjoyed hearing of our adventures.  We are thinking about where we will start planting a few boxes so stay tuned.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting everyone, Wendy (a.k.a. Love to Carve)<br/>
