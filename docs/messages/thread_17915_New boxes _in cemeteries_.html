cemeteries... two in hollow places in trees, three under <br/>
trees/bushes along the fenceline, covered with various things like <br/>
stone, bark, sticks and leaves, and one is under a loose flower bed <br/>
border type stone at the foot of a grave. This one is a family grave <br/>

&gt; &gt;   I would like to hide one at the cemetery but<br/>
&gt; where do you hide <br/>
&gt; it without it<br/>
&gt; &gt;   being buried.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a 12 box series based on the Zodiac hidden in<br/>
12 different towns in Western MA. Most of the<br/>
cemetaries are still active, meaning that they aren't<br/>
full and/or closed to new burials. Most of the boxes<br/>
are hidden in or behind trees, but one is hidden in an<br/>
old stump, another is in a rock wall, and still<br/>
another is simply hidden under some brush and whatnot.<br/>
If you'd like to get an idea of what the clues are<br/>
like, look my name up at the LbNA site, and pick one.<br/>
Hopefully, they all survived the winter. :-)<br/>
<br/>

.....who thinks it's looking a lot like spring in New<br/>
England!!<br/>

My father carved his own gravestone.  Being a stonecutter, he saw no reason to leave it to his three daughters to find someone to do it after his death, so he did it.  My younger sister was totally flipped out over the fact that our dad sat in a cemetary putting his own name on the family stone!<br/>
