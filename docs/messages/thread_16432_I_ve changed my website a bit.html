                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have made a few changes to my website because I have several clues and I'm using a "free" website that only gives me a limited number of pages and entries per page.<br/>
I have moved all my clues to the pages of the LBNA site, but my website can still be used to get the history of various areas, lists of boxes in each area, boxes or areas that are nearby, and in some cases- directions to the various areas/parks. <br/>
<br/>
I have kept the pages that show the stamps I have carved (&amp; have added several) they are placed mostly in S.W. Ohio &amp; S.E. Ind. but a few are in central Michigan.  I also added a page with my finds/exchanges/events to date. <br/>
<br/>
I'm out of pages to post my carvings, so I'll likely delete some of the early carvings to make way for the new when I have more to add.<br/>
