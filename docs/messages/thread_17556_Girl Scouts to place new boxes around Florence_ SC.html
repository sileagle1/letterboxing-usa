We will be placing numerous boxes in the Florence area in the next couple of weeks.  My daughter is trying to place on at the local National Cemetery.  My question is... do you have to get permission to place boxes at State Parks and if so what is the easiest way to do it?<br/>
<br/>
We have located a couple of boxes and it really got the excitement going so any comments &amp; suggestions will be greatly appreciated!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

While it is good to get permission to place a box, the state park <br/>
sytem doesn't have a formal policy.  Well, they don't ahve a formal <br/>
policy in regards to geocaches and considering boxing is much more <br/>
low profile, I doubt it's even on their radar.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of caches in state parks with and without permission <br/>
and many mangers and rangers are very cache friendly.<br/>
<br/>
This brings up I need to discuss with my associates about making sure <br/>
letterboxing is included in the negotiations.<br/>
