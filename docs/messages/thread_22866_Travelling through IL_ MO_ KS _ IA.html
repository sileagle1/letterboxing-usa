                    <div class="plaintext-content">Over the Thanksgiving weekend, we will be travelling from Milwaukee to <br/>
Oklahoma City up to Kansas City, through Davenport, IA to get back home <br/>
again.  I am looking for boxes that would be easy access from the <br/>
Interstate (rest stops would be awesome!) and possibly with no long <br/>
hikes.  My husband will be extremely reluctant to make any long stops as we <br/>
are driving straight through on the way down to OK.<br/>
<br/>
 From Milwaukee to OKC, we will be on I-43 to I-39 at Rockford, IL to I-55 <br/>
(Springfield, IL) to St. Louis, MO where we pick up I-44 for the rest of <br/>
the trip to OKC.  Then the return trip, we will be on I-35 from OKC to <br/>
Raymore, MO (outside of Kansas City on up to Des Moines, IA and then we <br/>
take I-80 the rest of the way across IA until we hit I-88 to come back <br/>
north towards WI.<br/>
<br/>
I know this looks complicated, but if one looks at the map, it really <br/>
isn't, LOL!  I am just hoping for Letterboxing along the way!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and are there any that we just should not miss in OKC (North <br/>
side/Edmond area)?  As we will be there for 3 days, my husband (and <br/>
children) know we will be doing some letterboxing while we are there!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are quite a few in Northern Oklahoma City.  I'm not sure how <br/>
many are still current check the clues.  It also depends greatly on <br/>
the weather as I'm sure you know if you're "coming home."  The <br/>
forecast looks pretty good for the weekend.  <br/>
<br/>
The Leaves Series in Mitch Park are mostly there and this is a very <br/>
nice park.<br/>
<br/>
There are several at Martin Nature Park just off Memorial by Quail <br/>
Springs Mall.  I'm not sure what days they're open over the holiday.  <br/>
There normal closed days are Monday &amp; Tuesday.<br/>
<br/>
There are several at the free part of Arcadia lake and it's just off <br/>
the highway.  These are hidden by Mandy and WyldBlueberries.<br/>
<br/>
There are a TON hidden around Draper Lake if you want to venture that <br/>
far south.  If you do e-mail and let us know.  We'll be visiting <br/>
family just a 1/2 mile from the lake and we'd love to meet for an <br/>
exchange.<br/>
<br/>
Have a safe trip and a Happy Thanksgiving.<br/>
