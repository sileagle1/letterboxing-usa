If anyone has been to our Smeigle letterbox at Wadsworth State Park <br/>
in Middlefield recently would you please contact us.  Apparently the <br/>
box is where it belongs but is missing it's contents.  We're hoping <br/>
that someone put it in with their stuff by mistake.  At the very <br/>
least I'd like to know how about how long it's been empty.  I hope to <br/>
get out to check on it sometime this week.  Working for a living sure <br/>
does get in the way sometimes!  Thanks to Sojourner for letting us <br/>
know that our box is empty.<br/>

I'm sorry, what state are you speaking of?<br/>
Please in future, put the State Abbreviation in the Subject header of your email.<br/>
That really helps folks direct the email to the state/placer,etc.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
CT: Smeigle<br/>
<br/>
I'm *ssuming that you are speaking of Connecticut-land-of-boxes.<br/>
If not, then you know what the * means for you and me.<br/>
