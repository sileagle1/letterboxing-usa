Buzzard, please post an update if you do go looking for it in the near<br/>
future, otherwise we can make a side trip over there - we'll by the area a<br/>
lot in September, going from Santa Monica to Pomona and back too many times<br/>
to count for the fair.<br/>

In a private Email, I described the location of the Succulent <br/>
Letterbox to Purple Iris, who recently searched for this box, and she <br/>
confirmed that this was the exact location in the Arboretum that she <br/>
checked.  Purple Iris did not find the box, so the Succulent <br/>
Letterbox is definetly missing; too bad, it had a nice cactus-image  <br/>
stamp.  Don't let this stop Gnosis 4-H from looking for my <br/>
letterboxes, which are planted just a few short miles from the Los <br/>
Angeles County Arboretum in Pasadena and Altadena.  (Gets hot out <br/>
here in August and September, though, keep that in mind.)<br/>
