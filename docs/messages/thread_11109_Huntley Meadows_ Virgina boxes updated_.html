Both of the Huntley Meadows boxes in Virginia have been updated with clean books and real tupperware thanks to Celtic Pride. One box had a missing stamp for awhile and was replaced with a store bought stamp. Celtic pride added a copy of the original stamp and I believe they also left the store bought one. So now that box has 2 stamps. We will call it a two4one. For those of you who missed the original stamp you might want to revisit. You should start seeing turtle and some spring migrating birds in the swamp soon. Not to mention mateing frogs, now that is a site.<br/>
May there be lots of nuts in your life,<br/>
