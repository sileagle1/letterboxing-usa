 From my understanding of trademark law, the owners of a trademark must <br/>
enforce their mark or they risk losing it. As a result, they are forced to <br/>
be pretty rigorous in protecting the trademark, no matter how petty or <br/>
insignificant or unknowing the possible infringement. If they allowed even <br/>
handful of unauthorized uses of their trademark, someone could come along <br/>
and make a case that they're not protecting their existing trademark so the <br/>
mark should be revoked.<br/>
<br/>
Still, their attorneys don't have to be so heavy-handed about it, <br/>
especially when tracking down non-commercial uses, especially since it only <br/>
generates ill will towards the trademark owner.<br/>

Greetings SilentDoug <br/>
<br/>
It is always nice to hear from you.  I personally have to agree with <br/>
you, due to the fact that companies are responsible for maintaining <br/>
their trademarks and copyrights on their own, while unfortunate, it <br/>
has to be done.  I would point out to those that are so disturbed by <br/>
it, that there are some cases where it is not a multibillion dollar <br/>
company, but some little nobody who trademarked their idea and cannot <br/>
keep other people from using.  I think it is always important to put <br/>
the shoe on the other foot.  Imagine for a moment if you will if you <br/>
worked for a big company and went to your boss with a great idea.  <br/>
They took that idea and you now collect royalties on the profits from <br/>
it That idea was yours, you own it, gave birth to it, would you want <br/>
someone else to use that idea to profit from and take the chance that <br/>
it would hurt your original creation?  In the sense that it has <br/>
happened here it is a little out of hand, however as Doug pointed out <br/>
I think it is important to keep in mind that they have to do this so <br/>
that if it is a situation that causes for such measures in the future <br/>
they still have a legal ground to stand on.  Another thing I think is <br/>
important to point out is that sometimes not taking the time to do <br/>
your homework and get the appropriate permissions can be a problem.  <br/>
I know several people personally who have gotten letter from artists <br/>
giving them cease and desist orders just for having copies of their <br/>
photos on a website.  Perhaps the artists and even Six Flags in this <br/>
case, would have given their consent if they had been contact before <br/>
hand. <br/>
<br/>
Team Rayenhaus  I don't mean to be a thorn in your side or a voice <br/>
of annoyance, but you might also want to consider the name of your <br/>
next planned event.  It also parallels with a very well known <br/>
gathering around that time of year and since someone seems to be keen <br/>
on dropping anonymous messages to companies about what you are doing, <br/>
you might want to save yourselves and the LbNA Owners anymore legal <br/>
hassles and come up with another name for that event as well.<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well, <br/>
pandora{HIB}  "Pandy" of Team Chaos<br/>

I've been in contact with the lawyers from Ostrolenk, Faber, Gerb and Soffen who represent Six Flags as intellectual Property counsel concerning this and have been told that it was not a random search that pulled it up, but, rather they, Wild Waves, was notified of a Halloween themed event taking place in Tacoma that was using their trademarked name.<br/>
<br/>
Which, in and of itself, is a sad state of affairs.  I never realized that some of the people in this hobby were that mean and petty.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, well. Like I said, it's over and we need to learn from it, not forget it and move on.<br/>
