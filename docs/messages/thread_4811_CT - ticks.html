&gt; at this point I don't feel <br/>
&gt; comfortable going into the woods to letterbox unless I step up our <br/>
&gt; tick prevention.  I'd like to know what others do.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Sorry to hear one of your munchkins is sick with Lyme disease.  You're<br/>
already doing all the things I know about to help combat the problem.  I<br/>
wouldn't let it stop you from letterboxing, though, as ticks are likely<br/>
present in your yard and at the park and riding the neighbor's cat and<br/>
everywhere else you go.  We find them on us just from being out in the<br/>
yard sometimes.  We're living in an area endemic for Lyme (all of us, the<br/>
whole state), and those little buggers don't understand that they should<br/>
stay off the trails and in the woodsiest part of the woods.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I hope your child was diagnosed early on in the illness, as that seems to<br/>
be the key to quick resolution with no further problems.  Two out of four<br/>
of the folks in our family have had Lyme disease and the remaining two<br/>
have been bitten but have been lucky enough not to get sick so far. <br/>
:::sigh:::<br/>
<br/>
peace -- debbie in glastonbury, with plans to tromp through the woods<br/>
tomorrow if these skies clear up!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Of course, prevention of Lyme Disease should be as important to us as <br/>
drinking water. They say that insect repellants with more than 23% <br/>
DEET are whats needed to repel ticks--that's a pretty strong poison <br/>
for little kids to wear, and it should be showered off as soon as you <br/>
get home. Wear light-colored, full-coverage clothing so you can <br/>
see ticks when they get on your clothes. And if they do get to <br/>
your skin, getting ticks off fast, and doing so without crushing the <br/>
body, is very important. <br/>
<br/>
I've had the Lyme vaccine, but Bruce opted not to get it because the <br/>
side effects include arthritis and other joint problems (he has enough <br/>
problems with joints being a carpenter). Still, the vaccine only <br/>
protects against less than 80% of the variants of Lyme anyway...Its <br/>
frequently misdiagnosed because sypmtoms mimic a number of maladies <br/>
(except that ring-rash which is not always present). Even early <br/>
diagnosis is not always effective as the spirokeet is a smart little <br/>
bugger which hides in tissues where antibiotics are less likely to <br/>
find it--like joint tissue and brain tissue. (ick)<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line...be careful and good luck!<br/>

I have had Lyme 3 times and finally went for the vaccine, which was Lymerix, did all three boosters. Never picked a tick off me for the next 2 years but this year I have already picked ticks. Why did they pull Lymerix off the market? I was wondering as I hadn't heard that.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
It was pulled off the market in February, and "poor sales" was indeed<br/>
given as the reason.<br/>
<br/>
However, there were also allegations of Lymerix causing arthritis, and<br/>
a rather large number of lawsuits, but the FDA found no evidence<br/>
supporting a link.  It probably contributed to it being pulled from<br/>
the market (because of litigation costs, if nothing else).  Here's one<br/>
article:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.sciam.com/explorations/2000/070500tick/<br/>
<br/>
Also, sales were lagging since a lot of doctors were recommending<br/>
against it, either because of the above controversy, or because of a<br/>
CDC epidemiological study that said it wasn't economically effective<br/>
unless it was just given to very high risk individuals[1]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[1] Of which I know a few.  Field biologists who spend most of the<br/>
year outside doing fieldwork in areas with a Lyme risk have a<br/>
substantial risk factor.  At least now they are getting better at<br/>
recognizing the symptoms early.<br/>
