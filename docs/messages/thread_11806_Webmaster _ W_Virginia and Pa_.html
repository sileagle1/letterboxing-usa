looking up one of my boxes for the I80 thread that  my  "Black <br/>
Coffee" letterbox at Wheeling W. Virginia  is on my website but <br/>
didn't make it over to the state page. it is rte 70 not 80 I couldn't <br/>
remember but it is a drive up. Also I noticed that my " Buggy Box " <br/>
was not on the Pennsylvania page both are on my website  do I need to <br/>
get them reposted to the list or can you pull them from my site by <br/>
copy and paste or web address there?  Thanks so much Leader of the <br/>
Pack<br/>
