<div><span class="160194402-08012003">While warning 
Butterfly and remembering my fall, I couldn't help thinking about when I got to 
the hospital and the excellent care I received there by two fellow letterboxers, 
Irish Mum and B Weekend Warrior. Here I come limping into the ER 
room of Windham Hospital. I had to tell the ER nurse what happened and I didn't 
want to mention letterboxing so I said I was hiking. I said I knew a couple ER 
nurses there but by their email names. I was talking to B Weekend Warier! She 
got me settled into a room so I could lay down and the Doctor comes in and he 
starts doing his thing while talking about letterboxing. He actually had a stamp 
but I don't believe he had started letterboxing yet. Then Irish Mum, who is 
another ER nurse comes in to see how I'm doing. I had met her and her 
family on the trail near the Air Mail Letterbox once in Mansfield. Irish Mum and 
B Weekend Warier had everyone that worked in that area knowledgeable about 
letterboxing. I go for X rays and the guy wheeling me around starts talking 
about boxing. I couldn't help but laugh (which hurt) when I was on a table 
being positioned for an X ray, and the woman in there asked a question about 
letterboxing while helping me to move into a position for a good X ray. Then 
back to my original room. Then my brother comes in. He's a security guard there. 
He heard a little about boxing by people in the ER area, so he vaguely knew 
what I was attempting to find that day. If there ever was a Letterboxing ER 
Room, Windham Hospital in Willimantic CT is it!  All great people 
there. It truly is a letterboxers emergency room. Would have enjoyed my 
visit more though if it wasn't for that darn fall I had taken earlier. 
Thanks again B Weekend Warier and Irish Mum. I've been doing fine and completely 
healed for some time now. Hope to see you again, but next time under 
better circumstances.....Chuck</span></div></body></html>

Hey, what type of coffie do you two want. I'm in that ED often for <br/>
work (American Ambulance), and if I can get Amy and myself a new <br/>
stamp, it'd be worth a coffie.<br/>

I was just thinking--- I love the idea of you guys having a stamp there<br/>
at the Windam Hospital ER room, and thought that the unfortunate<br/>
letterboxers that come to you hurt need to also get to stamp in. Maybe<br/>
different color ink pads, like hummm  ? purple ink for the injured folks<br/>

&gt; To bad you weren't there when the Cowboy was brought in  on the <br/>
night before thanksgiving. His snowball fight adventure wasn't a <br/>
letterboxing injury but we would have loved to meet you.  A box there <br/>
would certainly get us to drive down the hill offering in hand! Now <br/>
here is a thought, you could prestamp cards so  a visitor would not <br/>
necesarily interupt work at a crucial moment and every visitor could <br/>
make a donation either to the staff or the hospital! A new charity <br/>
box. The box could be in the security guys booth  or at the <br/>
registration desk. Might add a light relief to an often intense job!  <br/>
Either way we are grateful you are there when we need you - THANK-YOU<br/>
Leader of the Pack<br/>
