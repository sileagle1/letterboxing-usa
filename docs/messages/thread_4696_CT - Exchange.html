<br/>
     This isn't really a letterbox it is more of a stamp exchange.  On the<br/>
first day of spring, at sunrise the Westery Morris Men will be dancing on<br/>
the top of Lantern Hill in North Stonington, CT (near the Tribal Nation<br/>
Letterbox).  See the press release at bottom of page for directions.  I will<br/>
be making a stamp (my first) for this event, you are welcome to watch us<br/>
dance and exchange stamps.  If you want to learn more about Morris dancing<br/>
check out our web site.<br/>

<br/>
Morris Dancing might even be a stranger hobby than letterboxing, but we have<br/>
lots of fun and I hope to see some letterboxers on the top of the hill.<br/>
<br/>
Have a happy Spring,<br/>
Rick<br/>

Here is  a copy of the Morris Men's Press Release for the event.<br/>
<br/>
MARCH 20, 2002 - VERNAL EQUINOX SUNRISE DANCE ON LANTERN HILL<br/>
<br/>
The Westerly Morris Men will celebrate the Vernal Equinox by dancing at dawn<br/>
on the summit of Lantern Hill in North Stonington, Connecticut. The Vernal<br/>
Equinox is the moment at which the center of the Sun lies precisely above<br/>
the Earth's equator, astronomically marking the beginning of Spring.<br/>
<br/>
Participants in the hike and festivities will start meeting at the base of<br/>
the hill at 5:00 A.M. on Wednesday, March 20. By 5:20 A.M., all present<br/>
will start the 10-20 minute hike to the summit. Sunrise will occur at about<br/>
5:51 A.M. (Source: U.S. Naval Observatory web site at<br/>
http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS_OneDay.html ).<br/>
<br/>
Lantern Hill is located on the Ledyard / North Stonington town line, just<br/>
south of Route 2. The trailhead is on Wintechog Hill Road, which is one<br/>
road east of Lantern Hill Road / Route 214, the location of the Foxwoods<br/>
Casino. The trailhead is less than 1/4 mile south of Route 2.<br/>
<br/>
The Vernal Equinox hike was originally started by Betsy Oller of the<br/>
Pequotsepos Outing Club, of Mystic. Morris dancing was introduced to the<br/>
event in 1987.<br/>
<br/>
The public is invited and welcome to this open annual event. Typically, 70<br/>
or more people make this early morning trek.<br/>
<br/>
The actual Equinox will occur at 2:16 P.M. EST, March 20 (Source: U.S.<br/>
Naval Observatory via the National Weather Service web site at<br/>
http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/box/equinox.html). This hike traditionally<br/>
occurs at the dawn of the day in which the Equinox falls in the Eastern Time<br/>
Zone. According to the Weather Service web site, the Vernal Equinox will<br/>
occur on March 20 through at least the year 2005, therefore, long-range<br/>
planners can place this event on their calendars on March 20 every year<br/>
through 2005!<br/>

<br/>
This event occurs regardless of the weather, solely at the discretion of the<br/>
participants.<br/>
