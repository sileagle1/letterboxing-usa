I recently learned that the best way to lead a rewarding life is to use<br/>
things and care for people.  Letterboxing is a "thing!"  If you use it as a<br/>
mode of recreation and refreshment, that's alright.  However, if it comes<br/>
before the welfare of others, I can't justify it.  My suggestions and<br/>
warnings were made with the hope that people would see a potential problem<br/>
and put their heads together to seek a reasonable solution.  Instead they<br/>
acted as if I were attacking a loved one.  Quite frankly, that turns my<br/>
stomach.<br/>
<br/>
I had a life before letterboxing and I'll have one after.  It's a sad<br/>
statement that is made about our American culture when people fight so<br/>
tenacously for a "thing."  However, I've said my piece and know when I'm up<br/>
against a brick wall.<br/>
<br/>
May your paths be smooth and I sincerely hope that none of my predictions<br/>
come true.  However, for the time-being Stone Needle in NJ will be off the<br/>
list and I'll just have to go back to enjoying the outdoors without a stamp<br/>
pad.<br/>

I find it interesting that your posts on this topic have somehow changed<br/>
their focus from dire fire &amp; brimstone predictions about the liability<br/>
factor to human compassion.  When this group as a majority defend our<br/>
intention to keep the lawyers out of letterboxing, we are blasted for not<br/>
being compassionate?<br/>
<br/>
The sad thing about the culture is that we would not be allowed to be a part<br/>
of this simple, enjoyable hobby without legal backing.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you on the trail!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The legal issues are about compassion for you too.  Compassion for <br/>
people who are enjoying a hobby who may get the shaft from somebody <br/>
who can't use common sense and take care of themselves.  If I'm <br/>
pointing out to you that there's a psychotic sniper with a gun in a <br/>
particular area looking for a victim, does that mean I support the <br/>
sniper?  <br/>
<br/>
I'm going to do some research now. I think there's a way that nobody <br/>
placing a letterbox will ever have to write a lengthy disclaimer <br/>
again. (without incorporating)  I'll get back to you in a while.<br/>

Now relax and have some fun.<br/>

I'm sorry that you feel compelled to move on. You have brought a lot of <br/>
good to this list in the past, but when you "speak up" and introduce <br/>
something that, in my opinion, will never happen and then beat it to death <br/>
while suggesting that we are not aware or smart enough or courageous <br/>
enough, you should expect some responses. Randy is right, this is not the <br/>
forum for this discussion, so I will make this my last mailing on the subject.<br/>
<br/>

Like fighting so tenaciously for that freedom thing? Those damn Americans, <br/>
how dare they stick up for something they believe in.  <grin><br/>

I hope you will continue to read and post to this list, but if not, perhaps <br/>
we'll meet on a trail somewhere. Good luck.<br/>
