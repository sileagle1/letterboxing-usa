We did the three Disney boxes just a couple of months ago.  They are <br/>
all very very easy.  One is almost in site of a guard booth though so <br/>
they really need to be discreet.  The one in Celebration is about ten <br/>
feet from a geocache if they like those as well.  <br/>

for vacation. It was fairly simple to find. We had to do it dead reckoning<br/>
though, as we forgot the compass. We didn't have time in our schedule to<br/>
look for the other two. It was one of our first boxes. And it had a<br/>
hitchhiker in it! Our first! The Wilderness Lodge is a beautiful hotel. It<br/>
has a geyser that erupts every so often. Also, tell your friend to have<br/>
lunch in the restaurant there. I forget the name but it is the less<br/>
expensive of the two in the hotel and is directly off the lobby. Excellent<br/>
nachos and, if he's got little kids, they have hobby horses for the kids to<br/>
ride. Hope this helps!<br/>

I don't think they know about geocaches.  I've never seen one myself.  It <br/>

Celebration is still here &amp; a must see town, we love it there.  I <br/>
believe "The mouse" has confiscated the two at the Disney hotels.  <br/>
There was a mouse trap (no I'm not kidding) exactly were the <br/>
carribean beach was supposed to be.  So either we were off or they <br/>
are gone.  There is one that is not to far called Sebastian.  The <br/>
hardest part is getting through the gate guard.  Try saying that you <br/>
are interested in the property and want to drive by some houses.  <br/>
There are tons for sale in the neighborhood (I'm in Real Estate-<br/>
definitely not a good sign).  Watch for ticks at this one.  I think <br/>
that celebration would hook them for sure<br/>
