Mount Monadnock on our annual trip.  Unfortunately we didn't realize that<br/>
dogs are not allowed on the mountain :(  So after sneaking Max up the<br/>
Birchtoft Trail (great one, thanks Wanda &amp; Pete) and passing dozens of<br/>
racers, then being yelled at that dogs weren't allowed, finally getting<br/>
almost to the Drew's Grand Monadnock #2 only to find the racers check in<br/>
station right by the box's intersection, we decided to turn back.  We are<br/>
hoping to make a day trip of it within the next week.  We decided instead to<br/>
go to Shieling Forest to find the Cinco DeEmma Maija box.  Last year we<br/>
found the first box there and loved it.  The forest is an easy, beautiful<br/>
walk, so we were anxious to return for another hike.  Well, we had to go all<br/>
the way back to our campsite (I only brought the Monadnock clues) then head<br/>
back to Peterborough for the box.  After about 5 minutes of walking we could<br/>
hear thunder rolling in quickly and decided to head back.  Lucky we did<br/>
because a huge thunderstorm was just arriving with lots of lightening and<br/>
heavy rain.  Since the storm moved in so fast, we decided to wait a while to<br/>
see if it would also pass quickly.  Fortunately it did, and soon we were off<br/>
on our adventure.  The clues were tough, but after maybe 10 minutes of<br/>
searching we had success!!  Finally we had found a box!<br/>
    Sunday on our way back to CT, we decided to take a short side trip to<br/>
Shirley Center and find the two boxes hidden there.  We parked by the town<br/>
hall and spent a while exploring the beautiful and historic town green area.<br/>
After reading the two monuments we lined up our compass readings and found<br/>
the first box!  It was in great shape with all its contents in tact and dry.<br/>
Next, we followed the clues for the Town Pound Box.  This too, was nearby<br/>
and easy to find, but when I pulled the box out of its hiding spot, it was<br/>
empty!!! The only thing inside was a postcard with the stamp image on it.<br/>
The box was quite damp inside, so we are hoping the contents are at<br/>
someone's home drying out!  We took the postcard to use the stamp image, and<br/>
wrote a note and stamped a seperate piece of paper which we left in the box.<br/>
Erik- Thank you for showing us this wonderful site!  We drove by to see the<br/>
Bull Run Covered Bridge, but didn't get too close as there was a wedding in<br/>
progress.<br/>
    Hope everyone had a great, dry, letterboxing weekend,<br/>
Melissa in a now cool, CT<br/>

I hope the clues aren't too difficult for other people to find as well. 
While I wanted it to be challenging, I didn't want it to be so cryptic
that one comes up empty-handed!  If anyone else does go hunt for this
box, please check the map at the entrance to the forest first for a clue.
