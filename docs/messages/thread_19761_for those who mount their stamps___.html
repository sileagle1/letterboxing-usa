                    <div class="plaintext-content">You could buy pre-made stamps and rip the stamp part off and use the<br/>
wooden block. Some wise person posted this the other day. Personally,<br/>
I love the idea of ripping off the crappy stamp image. Or you could go<br/>
to a home improvement store and buy some wood and sandpaper and do it<br/>
yourself (might need to get a saw too). That's what I do.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

Hobby Lobby, about 6" wide by 18" long, and I cut it<br/>
down using a small narrow band hand saw.  I then sand<br/>
the edges and I stamp the image on the top of the<br/>
board (and later carefully mount the stamp so that<br/>

which direction to hold it to get a right-side-up<br/>
image).  I spray the whole thing with sealant, then<br/>
glue the stamp to the bottom of the mount using shoe<br/>
goo or crafter's putty.  The trick is to be careful<br/>
not to let the bonding agent clump or gather so the<br/>
stamp is uneven. <br/>

varnish to be waterproof, and glue on stamp.  Sometime I will also take a <br/>
piece of foam (thin stuff you can buy is sheets) and mount that between stamp <br/>
and wood.  Should apply a litte sper varnish along the edges to reduce water <br/>
absorption.  Good luck.<br/>

My favorite material for this is plastic... you can pick up a kitchen <br/>
cutting board at the dollar store and there's enough material for a <br/>
lot of stamps. The board itself is only about 1/8 inch thick, is <br/>
still flexible enough to get a good ink transfer in the middle areas <br/>
of larger stamps, and won't warp due to humid weather or floods the <br/>
way wood does. I use a band saw to cut it up, but any saw or utility <br/>
knife could work. I've been using contact cement to afix it to the <br/>
rubber, but haven't had this field tested long enough yet to know if <br/>
it works well enough as an all-weather adhesive.<br/>
