Here's an interesting thought.....  Why should the wants/needs of the few outweigh the wants/needs of the many?  <br/>
There's a vocal minority (And I include myself in that group) that are active on the mailing lists and a Majority that <br/>
are not.  Just because a few don't want to be bothered by the same questions asked over and over and over again, why <br/>
should we stop answering questions?  I for one believe that a person can exercise their own censorship if you will, by <br/>
not reading a post that's titled "What's a hitchhiker?"  Why is that such a hard thing?<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of pissing off every feminist on this group, I kinda think this debate is as useful as the age old debate <br/>
over, Toilet seat up or Toilet seat down.  Women could just as well put the seat up when they were done as men can <br/>
put it down when they are done.  Yet the debate still rages. And will continue to do so for the rest of time.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think we should censor or stop anyone from asking anything at all on this list no matter how many times it's <br/>
been asked in the past. After all, this is the place where people come to learn about letterboxing, isn't it? And <br/>
that's one way to welcome new members isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
If it comes down to closing this list to new people and/or stopping the questions then I'll say this: I don't like the <br/>
idea for some of the same reasons why I don't like My Documents, remote avatars, My Computer, vanity plates, mile long <br/>
URLs, %20, reality shows, and war. If that didn't make much sense, that is the point....<br/>
<br/>
Let's all just get out there and box!<br/>

Makes me think of a board of directors on which I served.  We were charged with making a major and necessary change in how the organization was run, and there were several possibilities, each of which would benefit a different segment of our very large group.  We met multiple times, into the wee hours of the morning, trying to come up with the most equitable and fair solution.  When we made our decision known, we were accused of not caring about various factions within the group.  I knew we had come up with the right answer when it became apparent we had managed to offend everyone in the group!!  No favorites there!<br/>

Just look before you pee or sit.<br/>

How hard can that be?<br/>

We leave it up for the dog.<br/>
