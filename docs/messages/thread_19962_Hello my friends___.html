I would like to take the time tell you, my letterboxing voters, that <br/>
I too am an avid letterboxer, but have been prevented from doing so <br/>
since its inception due to the pressures of running this, your <br/>
country.  I have a personal stamp carved and carry it with me always <br/>
in the hopes my campaign trail will take me near another letterbox <br/>
which I have no time to find.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters, Jen and Barb have kept me informed me of the plight of <br/>
orphaned and sabotaged letterboxes and ones that go MIA. And I want <br/>
you to know, every letterbox that is MIA is one more missing <br/>
letterbox.  Sabateurs  never stop thinking about ways to harm your <br/>
letterboxes, and neither do I.  It is because of that, I signed the <br/>
Healthy Forests Restoration Act in 2003 to significantly reduce the <br/>
threat of letterbox destruction caused by natural disaster.<br/>
<br/>
To Mr. Pepe, you have interviewed Senator Kerry. Give me equal time. <br/>
Give me, as America's opponent, an interview.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, a vote for me, is a vote from you.<br/>

<br/>
Your stamp is indeed nice, but I have reason to believe it was <br/>
carved by a letterboxing front group.<br/>
