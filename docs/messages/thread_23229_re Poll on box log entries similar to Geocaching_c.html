<br/>
Don't feel too bad. It's kind of a loaded question anyhow. =) The<br/>
question was posed as a way to 'review' another letterbox. And let's<br/>
face it--most people don't want their boxes honestly critiqued because<br/>
they know the boxes aren't really as good as they like to think they<br/>
are. Don't get me wrong--it can still be fun to find your typical,<br/>
average, everyday box. Most boxes, by definition, ARE average. But<br/>
nobody wants anyone pointing that out to them. Until you find a truely<br/>
exceptional letterbox--and you'll know it when you see it--it might be<br/>
hard to grasp that some boxes really are better than others.<br/>
<br/>
I don't really mind admitting that most of my boxes are average, at<br/>
best. A few might be particularly noteworthy, but most really aren't.<br/>
*shrug*<br/>
<br/>
As for logging comments--originally it seemed like most people were<br/>
concerned about spoilers. Which is a valid concern, but spoilers can<br/>
happen without an official comment logging area (i.e. message boards).<br/>
At least if there were an official place that someone could log<br/>
comments, it can be set up so the owner of the box can edit or delete<br/>
such spoilers which I think could be an improvement.<br/>
<br/>
At least for those boxes where spoilers are a concern. If you look at<br/>
the vast majority of boxes, the clues are pretty direct. 'Go down the<br/>
trail, look behind the tree on the right.' I kind of suspect if<br/>
someone made a comment 'No, the tree is on the left!', the owner<br/>
probably wouldn't be upset about the so-called spoiler. The clues are<br/>
meant to be direct, and if the clue wasn't clear or had an error, the<br/>
owner probably would appreciate the help.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere along the way, geocaching became the ugly big brother of<br/>
letterboxing and now people like to slam an idea they don't like by<br/>
comparing it to geocaching. Kind of like saying George Bush is worse<br/>
than Hilter because of invading Iraq under false pretenses. I'll<br/>
admit, I'm not a big fan of Bush, but come on, a comarison to Hitler<br/>
is not only extreme, but falls under the 'idiotic' book. If there was<br/>
a run-off between Hitler and Bush, I have no doubt which of the two<br/>
I'd prefer living under.<br/>
<br/>
So then people start complaining that such a logging/review feature is<br/>
too much like geocaching. Slam! But for every difference you can name<br/>
between the two, I could name ten similiarities. For that matter, I<br/>
could probably name ten differences for every similiarity one could<br/>
name. Letterboxing is not and will not ever 'become' geocaching.<br/>
Letterboxing is about art and clues. Geocaching is about trinkets and<br/>
GPSes. Nothing is going to change that.<br/>
<br/>
Some people like stats and high-tech features, some people don't.<br/>
Which is one reason I like having two letterboxing websites. LbNA is<br/>
simplier, straight-forward, and without bells or whistles. Or at least<br/>
it used to be. I'm kind of saddened by the fact that I think it's<br/>
purity isn't what it used to be. It's not virtualletterboxing.org.<br/>
It's not postalletterboxing.org. It's letterboxing.org. I'd rather<br/>
have it keep it's original purpose which it did with such simple elegance.<br/>
<br/>
Then there's AQ which generally does have a lot more bells and<br/>
whistles for those that prefer them. Sophisticated city searches, trip<br/>
planners, and support for every non-traditional type of letterbox<br/>
there is. They compliment each other nicely, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Is logging comments a bad thing? Yes and no. Some people like the<br/>
idea, some people don't. And some people probably don't like the idea<br/>
because of all the mud that's always thrown at the idea, but probably<br/>
would like it once they tried it.<br/>
<br/>
In a nutshell, I don't think the idea is as bad as its detractors<br/>
would lead you to believe, nor do I think the idea is as good as its<br/>
supporters would lead you to believe. It's simply a tool that some<br/>
people would find useful and others would not. I'd vote for LbNA *not*<br/>
to support such a feature--it's an unnecessary bell/whistle. I kind of<br/>
*do* want AQ to support it, though--bells and whistles is what AQ is<br/>
about. Something for everyone, and everyone a website. =)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, implementing it would take quite a bit of time and<br/>
resources that I'd rather spend working on other bells and whistles,<br/>
so I wouldn't count on such a feature showing up at AQ anytime soon.<br/>
<br/>
Do geocachers actually 'review' other people's caches? If that's true,<br/>
I'm very surprised! An organized vote for which are the best caches<br/>
doesn't seem like a very nice thing to implement. Logging comments<br/>
doesn't bother me as much as voting on the quality of other people's<br/>
creations.<br/>

  In reference to your question: Do geocachers actually 'review' other people's caches? No,  they don't. Caches are not rated, basically for the reasons you've  outlined. I have seen cache hiders put rating systems on their own  personal clue page but that's up to the individual. <br/>

  people would find useful and others would not. I'd vote for LbNA *not*<br/>
  to support such a feature--it's an unnecessary bell/whistle. I kind of<br/>
  *do* want AQ to support it, though--bells and whistles is what AQ is<br/>
  about. Something for everyone, and everyone a website. =)<br/>
<br/>
  Of course, implementing it would take quite a bit of time and<br/>
  resources that I'd rather spend working on other bells and whistles,<br/>
  so I wouldn't count on such a feature showing up at AQ anytime soon.<br/>
<br/>
  Do geocachers actually 'review' other people's caches? If that's true,<br/>
  I'm very surprised! An organized vote for which are the best caches<br/>
  doesn't seem like a very nice thing to implement. Logging comments<br/>
  doesn't bother me as much as voting on the quality of other people's<br/>
  creations.<br/>

I'm an avid reader.  And letterboxing is a journey that's similar to the<br/>
journey of reading a novel.  Imagine Dickens' "A Tale of Two Cities" if you<br/>
read the ending first.  My favorite book.  Re-reading it is great, but it's<br/>
because the same feelings return as when I first read it.  But if I'd read<br/>
the ending first in the first place...........ooooh, no goose bumps.  Not<br/>
good.<br/>

Depends on the comment. =) I mean, you could write that the stamp is<br/>
broken in two or the logbook is water-logged and needs to be replaced,<br/>
but it's not very helpful when you're holding the pieces of stamp or<br/>
the water-soaked logbook at the time.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to write about how great the weather was or wonderful the<br/>
stamp is, that can be written in the logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Unless, of course, if the logbook is missing or water-logged and<br/>
unable to take messages. Logbooks are not immortal.<br/>
<br/>
My point being--and I do have a point!---online comments have their<br/>
uses and it's not in any way a replacement for a traditional logbook.<br/>

Assuming you actually can cantact the placer. Many people change their<br/>
e-mail address without updating their account, e-mails bounce, drop<br/>

And so they email this list and ask if anyone has seen the placer.  <br/>
Usually someone puts them in touch with the placer or knows that the <br/>
placer has left the hobby.  Then an adoption of the box can occur.<br/>
<br/>
It works well enough.<br/>

Which works great when there's a hundred thousand boxes in the wild<br/>

It's a function that people love to hate, and I'm bothered by the<br/>
irrational fear people have of it. I'll admit, I'm *this* close to<br/>
implementing it on AQ just to prove the fears unfounded--especially<br/>

&gt; I'll admit, I'm *this* close to<br/>
&gt; implementing it on AQ just to prove the fears <br/>
&gt; unfounded--especially when people start making <br/>
&gt; unjustified comparisons to geocaching or fear<br/>
&gt; of spoilers--neither of which hold any substance <br/>
&gt; so far as I can see.<br/>
<br/>
I certainly can't speak for anyone else, but as for me, it has <br/>
nothing to do with fear, concerns about comparison, geocaching or <br/>
opposition to change.  I don't even necessarily think it is a bad <br/>
concept in and of itself.  But while I'm sure the feature has merit <br/>
and would even no-doubt serve to enhance the overall letterboxing <br/>
experience for *some* people, I simply do not see that there is <br/>
anything about such a logging feature that would support or enhance <br/>
the basic philosophy of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
My opposition to implementing such a feature on the LbNA site is <br/>
based on the belief that the LbNA site is first and foremost a clue <br/>
distribution site and should focus on remaining true to that <br/>
mission. <br/>
<br/>
I am not opposed to technical gizmos, bells and whistles or anything <br/>
else that an individual letterboxer wants to do to make the game <br/>
more to their liking and enjoyment.  I am, however, opposed to <br/>
implementing these features at the joint LbNA web site.  As the <br/>
primary letterboxing web site, new features that are implemented at <br/>
letterboxing.org have the effect of setting and/or changing the <br/>
principles of the game to include whatever has been added.  There <br/>
are many people who wish to play this game more bare bones than <br/>
others.  Implementing new features to accommodate the *others* <br/>
inadvertently changes the game and imposes on those who wish to <br/>
stick to the basics.<br/>

Which works great when there's a hundred thousand boxes in the wild and I have to weed through a bunch of posts about a box I know nothing about and can't do anything about.<br/>
