<br/>
NEWS FLASH:  Miss Scarlet Did It in the Kitchen with the Knife!  <br/>
<br/>
(Not to be confused with MizScarlet...)<br/>
(See photo evidence in this Group's Photos section.)<br/>
<br/>
Claire collected all 20 clue stamps from all the other detective attendees and deduced from her list who, what, and where, was missing.  She remained undaunted by the surprise suspect, Cruella DeVille, and the uncommon weapon, poison.  <br/>
<br/>
Claire wins a copy of the Clue board game, stamped inside with all of the day's Clues.  2nd and 3rd place, a Nymph? and Kreepy Kelli, received MasterCarve tools, or a sheet of the pink stuff.  (write me)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who came.  Special thanks to all the carvers who came through despite the last minute requests:  Tempus Fugit, Sewsoobizzy, GirlGuides, Schizokeet, Hikers and Hounds, Cyclonic, Music Woman, Chrissy, Kreepy Kelli, and Chili Pepper.  The stamps were Reallly Great.  <br/>
<br/>
Glad to see those from out of town who received a "you came so far" gift: hand warmer packs.  <br/>
<br/>
The stamps are now available as a traveling event set for any event that would like to play Clue Exchange.  "Clue Exchange was great fun, especially because most of us already had each other's sig stamps," said GirlGuides.  I recommend inviting local people to sign up to carve stamps and using this set as fill in or for the favorites.  Write me off list about the rules and lessons learned.<br/>
