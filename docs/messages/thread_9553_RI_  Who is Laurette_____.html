<br/>
Laurette is a letterboxer who lives in Southern Rhode Island.  She <br/>
has quite a few boxes out in the area.  She does read the posting <br/>
here so she may see this message.  I have her email address so I will <br/>
email her &amp; tell her that you found this stamp.  She &amp; I were <br/>
planning to go out letterboxing on Saturday so I know I will be <br/>
talking to her before then. <br/>
<br/>
I will have her post back to you here on the talk group to let you <br/>
know if it is her stamp.<br/>
<br/>

I thought you were not only famous, but infamous.  You are now forever embedded into the annals of Letterboxing history.  Congratulations!!!!  <br/>
