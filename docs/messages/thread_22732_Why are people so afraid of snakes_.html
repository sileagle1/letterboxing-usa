&gt; Why would anyone want to mess with any snake regardless of it's <br/>
&gt; coloring? Just leave it be, unless it has 2 inch fangs imbedded into <br/>

Not quite sure why snakes have such a bad rap. Except for the few<br/>
poisonous ones, snakes are pretty cool. I am aware that many people<br/>
are pathalogically afraid of them but I confess to not being sure<br/>
why... Is it a religious thing?<br/>

to keep a little garter snake in my pocket to keep my<br/>
older sister away from me. it worked very well!!!<br/>
also, regarding snakes being "slimey" they aren't.<br/>
they are dry and very sinewy, muscular and wonderful.<br/>
only slimey ones are eels because they live in the<br/>
water, but regular land snakes are dry.  <br/>
there are ones to avoid and we do go into their<br/>
habitat afterall, but they really want to avoid us<br/>
also.  so there's my 2 cents worth...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">the general population is not taught how to identify snakes, so since <br/>
there are poisonous snakes in many parts of the US those who do not <br/>
hav the training/knowledge on how to identify those few dangerous ones <br/>
are afraid of all snakes because they don't know if the snake they <br/>
come in contact with is poisonous or not. <br/>
<br/>
i'm from s. louisiana and my parents made sure that i knew the <br/>
difference between a copperhead and a kingsnake. how to identify a <br/>
moccasin vs. a rat snake.  so i know to stay away from certain snakes, <br/>
but not all snakes scare me. i ran across the overall snake fear <br/>
moving up here to the midwest where there are hardly any instances <br/>
where one would come across a poisonous snake....as opposed to my home <br/>
in s. louisiana where copperheads could be found in the backyard!<br/>
<br/>
so i think that the fear stems from ignorance. maybe they should teach <br/>
these types of life lessons in school.<br/>

Thanks for setting my asumptions straight. I don't like being misleading. Something about the way they slither across the group, but how else are they suppose to move:) I have fishes, snails, frogs (in my fish tank), dragon fish, shrimp, even hermit crabs, and an igronia (It did not survive think it was sick when we got it). My husband wants a snake not up to it with three small ones.<br/>

Never hurts to familiarize yourself some - enough to be aware.  It is tough to try and teach the differences in snakes, but great groups like Partners in Amphibian and Reptile Conservation (PARC - www.parcplace.org ) do education outreach, as well as local nature centers and such.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a good reason when I'm out boxing alone why I won't reach into dark holes, under logs, or stray too far from the path.  The only snake I've actually seen is a little tiny ringneck in NC.  ;-)<br/>

It's ignorance. If it's different, and especially if it lacks "arms" and legs, you'd <br/>
better kill it, is the way the reasoning (if you can call it that) goes. It's just <br/>
different, that's all, but that's scary.<br/>

I think that lots of people are scared of them because they're so alien--no<br/>
legs at all, so their movement is unusual-looking, perhaps disturbing. And,<br/>
we see and read so much about poison snakes, horror movies with snakes,<br/>
parables where snakes are presented as evil creatures (The Jungle Book, or<br/>
even the Bible).<br/>
<br/>
I think it's a good idea to read up on a few safety subjects about anywhere<br/>
you're going to go wandering around in the wilderness, not only to see what<br/>
poisonous snakes might be indigenous, but also other threats: bears, poison<br/>
ivy, when hunting season starts. Just to be informed.<br/>
