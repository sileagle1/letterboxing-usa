Annual Great Lakes Gathering on the regional board on Monday.  The <br/>
theme this year will be "Wandering in Wonderland", based on Alice's <br/>
Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass.  We've had a <br/>
great response on our regional board but I figured I'd also post the <br/>
info on the national board in case there are some local boxers who <br/>
only read "the big board".  (If you'd like to join the regional board, <br/>
here's a link:  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/ )<br/>
<br/>
I'd also like to extend an invitation to anyone who will be traveling <br/>
to or through the midwest in early June to join us for the event.  It <br/>
will be held on Saturday June 3 at Lapham Peak State Park, 25 miles <br/>
west of Milwaukee, WI.<br/>
