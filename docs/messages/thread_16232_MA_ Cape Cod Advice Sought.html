                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi fellow letterboxers. This message is for anyone who's been <br/>
boxing recently on Cape Cod, especially those who were at the <br/>
recent gathering. I'm going to be in Wellfleet for four days next <br/>
week and hope to find plenty of boxes. I've printed out clues for <br/>
about 50. What an abundance! I am hoping to hit F100 while <br/>
there and plan to launch some hitch hikers too.<br/>
<br/>
My question is: Are there any that are particularly nice, that you <br/>
especially liked? Are there any that appear to be missing? I'm <br/>
asking because I want to use my time wisely. (I don't want hints, <br/>
just thoughts on what boxes you liked best.)<br/>
<br/>
Although all letterboxes are fun to find, I must admit I like <br/>
handcarved stamps best. So for me, lowest priority would be <br/>
boxes with commercial stamps. Any info in that regard would be <br/>
appreciated. Please reply off list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much!<br/>
Bonnie <br/>

I'd be glad to tell you our favorites off list, but we don't have your<br/>
e-mail address.  If interested , please send it to mulbie@yahoo.com.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, I would like this info, too, (what Cape Cod boxes everyone likes <br/>
best, and especially ones with hand-carved stamps) if you could make a list-wide <br/>
response. I was tormented to be on Cape Cod this weekend but at my father's <br/>
75th birthday and unable to leave without some evil looks. It was so hard <br/>
knowing a gathering was going on. I did manage to sneak out and find the Joshua <br/>
Pond letterbox. It's within walking distance of my in-laws home so I'm thrilled <br/>
to have found a new little spot to take the kids when the weather warms. Thanks <br/>
to its planter!!<br/>
