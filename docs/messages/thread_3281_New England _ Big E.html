the World are you Letterboxing" booth to the Big E  which is New <br/>
Englands State Fair, in Springfield Mass.  We will be there  on Sept <br/>
27, and 30 in the New England Center.  Club children will take turns <br/>
explaing the letterboxing activity to the public.  We will have <br/>
available for  those of you who wish to seek us out a  event stamp  <br/>
and possibly a box ,if among the million or so people we can find a <br/>
reasonable spot to put one.  Please plan for exchanges as well. We <br/>
are so pleased to have this opportunity to share letterboxing in such <br/>
a great place. Hope to see you there.  Leader of the Pack<br/>

snagged the Big E event stamp.  We also easily located the Under the <br/>
Pines letterbox and the 4-H is Fun for Everyone! stamp.<br/>

Leader of the Pack was out enjoying the fair, so we unfortunately <br/>
didn't get to meet her.  But I'll be at the gathering in Rhode Island <br/>
next Saturday and hopefully I'll get to thank her in person for <br/>
getting us to the Big E.<br/>
<br/>
We had a fine time checking out the goats, sheep, pigs, horses, <br/>
llamas, and alpacas, and eating maple syrup cotton candy, snow cones, <br/>
corn dogs, and dough boys.  We spotted Mrs. Potato Head in the Rhode <br/>
Island center, and we watched a really bad stunt show that was little <br/>
more than a commercial for Toyota automobiles.  Kim played some skee-<br/>
ball and lost; I tried out the ultimate foot massager for a quarter.  <br/>
It was a chilly day, but we managed to have a great time, anyway.<br/>

Glad you came the kids were so excited to meet "REAL" letterboxers. I <br/>
heard all about it.  As for out having fun on the fair. We saw a lot <br/>
and  I woried about losing a kid all day. Imagine going to the midway <br/>
with 6 little boys. It is a great experience for the kids. We had 15 <br/>
kids there so 2-3 worked and the rest went out until their shift a <br/>
lesson in logistics for me and flexibility. We had loads of fun and <br/>
tired feet  those foot masages are great.  Leader of the pack<br/>
