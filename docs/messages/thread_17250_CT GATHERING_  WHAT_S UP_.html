is in order to discuss this much forgotten issue. I personally think <br/>
a little light discussion about this topic is what it would take to <br/>
get the ball rolling. Remember, it rained on us last time. I think <br/>
mother nature owes us one. I think WE owe OURSELVES one. Feb. might <br/>
work. Something before the bugs come marching in again and we're back <br/>
to emptying our wallets and purses in the name of insect <br/>
repellants.Think about it. I'll leave you all with a quote I leave <br/>
behind whenever I stamp in.----- "THINK WHERE GLORY MOST BEGINS AND <br/>
ENDS, AND SAY MY GLORY WAS I HAD SUCH FRIENDS" -W.B. YEATS ---<br/>
