I CANNOT believe you tossed out MarsCarve!  They are a luxury to me.  I<br/>
pretty much use any carving material I can get my hands on.  <br/>
<br/>
Nasco Saf-T-Kut is my preference because of the cost. But If I could<br/>
have any carving material I wanted and it was all the same price, I'd go<br/>
for the Staedtler stuff any day.  It's thick, cuts nicely, and doesn't<br/>
have to be sanded or primed in anyway.  No mounting required, either.<br/>
Kind of spendy to me, though.<br/>
<br/>
PZ Kut is a dream to carve with, but if if it's not sanded or<br/>
Scotch-brited the ink won't hold on the vinyl very well in my<br/>
experience.  Plus it has to be mounted since it's thin.  It's a high<br/>
maintenance product, but it is of good quality.<br/>
<br/>
The pink Speedy Kut stuff is O.K., but it is floppy and needs mounting,<br/>
so it's kind of high maintenance that way, but it holds ink very nicely<br/>
without anything having to be done with it.<br/>
<br/>
Nasco is kind of crumbly, but it is cheap, easy to carve and thick and<br/>
firm enough to go unmounted.  Takes the ink wonderfully.  No sanding<br/>
required.  It's probably the medium I use the most.  (Did I say cheap?)<br/>
<br/>
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TOSS THEIR MARSCARVE CAN CERTAINLY TOSS IT MY WAY IN<br/>
THE FUTURE, CAN YOU DIG?<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, I guess every one has their preference in materials. I still have<br/>
a chunk of Mastercarve that I dont know what to do with. Maybe a special<br/>
stamp for something big.<br/>

That is a drawback that you have to glue a piece of Balsa wood to the<br/>
PZKut.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It drives me crazy to put a lino carver to the crumbly stuff. I have <br/>
to go at it with a Dremel. Mastercarve is the only sheet good that <br/>
I've found smooth. Plenty of cheap (4 for a dollar at Big Lots) <br/>
erasers make great smaller stamps, but every now and then we plan <br/>
something larger. Thinness is not an issue for me, because Bruce will <br/>
put backers on stamps for me.<br/>
<br/>
My experience with ordinary pink erasers though, is that they don't <br/>
hold their shape. I used one for the Connecticut gathering, and after <br/>
about 50 impressions it was mushed. I had to touch it up that <br/>
afternoon. <br/>
<br/>
Echoing Amanda, one person's trash is another's treasure, I'll take <br/>
that Mars vinyl if you don't want it.<br/>
