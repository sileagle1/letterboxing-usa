<br/>
It's been a while since I've been on-line with you, but I've been reading emails when I get a chance.  I'm very happy to have had the chance to place a box on the Pacific Crest Trail in the Sierra Nevada mountains. I hope you have an opportunity to search for it in the non-snowy season.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This box is in the historic Donner Summit area, off Highway 80. Donner Summit is best known for the snow-bound Donner Party, the ill-fated pioneers who couldn't make it over the Sierra Nevada mountains before winter and had to camp on the shores of Donner Lake until they were rescued. <br/>
The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) is the jewel in the crown of Americas scenic trails, spanning 2,650 miles from Mexico to Canada through three western states. It reveals the beauty of the desert, unfolds the glaciated expanses of the Sierra Nevada, and provides commanding vistas of volcanic peaks and glaciers in the Cascade Range. The trail also passes through historic mining sites and evidence of mans endless quest for natural resources. It runs through the Donner Summit area, which is known for its year-around beauty. One will find nordic and downhill skiing in the winter and miles of  hiking trails and rock climbing opportunities in the summer. <br/>
Find the Pacific Crest Trailhead that is close to Lake Mary. You will find the trail winding up the mountain, through very rocky areas, through the forest, traversing the mountain. Approximately two miles from the trailhead, through the trees you will be surprised by Judah's chair. This landmark lets you know you're on the right path. Keep going through the woods until you see the house in the sky. Visit the house. This is a good place to have a snack and sip of water. Downhill from the house in the sky you will find the broken axel. Walk to it, carefully; the broken shale is slippery. Locate the large grey rock that aligns with the biggest building on the horizon. There lies the box.<br/>
<br/>
Watch out for bears. You may also see deer, scrub jays, ground squirrels and (groan) mosquitos! The weather can be hot, but its always cool in the shade. Make sure you have plenty of water so you won't get altitude sickness. <br/>

Coincidentaly, yesterday I was daydreaming on the road and remembered <br/>
an older California box from Mick last fall that never got posted on <br/>
the site. He emailed it in and got lots of positive feedback, but it <br/>
never made it onto the California map. It's at Glacier Point in <br/>
Yosemite, and I updated the LBNA site with that letterbox as well. <br/>
Apologies for the LONG delay, Mick!<br/>

Hey Matthew,<br/>
<br/>
You'll just have to get back up the hill to find my letterbox. I hope to plant a few more before the season's up. 3 more months until the snow falls, so there's still time. If you make it up, how about planting a box or two? Would love to search for them. <br/>
Have you searched for the boxes in Davis &amp; Auburn? I haven't had the time yet, but hope to soon.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;pioneers who couldn't make it over the Sierra Nevada mountains before <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;winter and had to camp on the shores of Donner Lake until they were <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;rescued.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) is the jewel in the crown of Americas <br/>
&gt;scenic &gt;&gt;trails, spanning 2,650 miles from Mexico to Canada through three <br/>
&gt;western &gt;&gt;states. It reveals the beauty of the desert, unfolds the <br/>
&gt;glaciated expanses &gt;&gt;of the Sierra Nevada, and provides commanding vistas <br/>
&gt;of volcanic peaks and &gt;&gt;glaciers in the Cascade Range. The trail also <br/>
&gt;passes through historic &gt;&gt;mining sites and evidence of mans endless quest <br/>
&gt;for natural resources. It &gt;&gt;runs through the Donner Summit area, which is <br/>
&gt;known for its year-around &gt;&gt;beauty. One will find nordic and downhill <br/>
&gt;skiing in the winter and miles of &gt;&gt;  hiking trails and rock climbing <br/>
&gt;opportunities in the summer.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Find the Pacific Crest Trailhead that is close to Lake Mary. You will <br/>
&gt;find &gt;&gt;the trail winding up the mountain, through very rocky areas, through <br/>
&gt;the &gt;&gt;forest, traversing the mountain. Approximately two miles from the <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;trailhead, through the trees you will be surprised by Judah's chair. <br/>
&gt;This &gt;&gt;landmark lets you know you're on the right path. Keep going through <br/>
&gt;the &gt;&gt;woods until you see the house in the sky. Visit the house. This is a <br/>
&gt;good &gt;&gt;place to have a snack and sip of water. Downhill from the house in <br/>
&gt;the sky &gt;&gt;you will find the broken axel. Walk to it, carefully; the broken <br/>
&gt;shale is &gt;&gt;slippery. Locate the large grey rock that aligns with the <br/>
&gt;biggest building &gt;&gt;on the horizon. There lies the box.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Watch out for bears. You may also see deer, scrub jays, ground squirrels <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;and (groan) mosquitos! The weather can be hot, but its always cool in <br/>
&gt;the &gt;&gt;shade. Make sure you have plenty of water so you won't get altitude <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;sickness.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;Could someone please post my clues? The dot on the map should be close <br/>
&gt;to &gt;&gt;Lake Tahoe at about 11:00.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Thanks, Linda<br/>
