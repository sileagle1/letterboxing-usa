My e-mail address is mindizney@cox.net.<br/>

We have SO many people from out of town that I fear that many will miss out on such great boxes!  I promise I won't go boxing today at Bluff ;-)  Though I have to drive the 3 hours this afternoon after work to the beach house to grab the bike rack, since Dad left it there a few weeks ago by mistake!<br/>
