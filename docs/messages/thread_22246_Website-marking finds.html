                    <div class="plaintext-content">You can.  Click on the little green flag and check it<br/>
out.  Also, AtlasQuest has that feature as well...<br/>
<br/>
It isn't really a problem with someone giving the<br/>
location away because there isn't room to comment. <br/>
Hopefully, a finder will use the "contact the placer"<br/>
feature and email the placer directly with any<br/>
comments.  <br/>
<br/>
The only downfall to the feature is that if folks<br/>
don't use it when they find the box, you still won't<br/>
know it's been found.  Based on the notifications I've<br/>
gotten and the number of stamps in my book, I would<br/>
say that MAYBE 25% of the finders either email me or<br/>
update the clue page to say they've found it.<br/>

&gt; I think there should be something on the<br/>
&gt; letterboxing website where if <br/>
&gt; you are logged in, you can say that you have found<br/>
&gt; one and keep track <br/>
&gt; of the boxes you have found. Geocaching has it. I<br/>
&gt; placed one sort of <br/>
&gt; far from me and the only way to see if anyone has<br/>
&gt; found it or make <br/>
&gt; sure it is ok is to go there but I can't very often.<br/>
&gt; The only problem <br/>
&gt; is that people might give away the location, but<br/>
&gt; hopefully it wouldn't <br/>
&gt; happen very often.<br/>
