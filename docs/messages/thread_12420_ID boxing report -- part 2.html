<br/>
I was the first to find Water the Eagle, Swan Falls Dam, Boulder Graveyard, <br/>
Welcome to Eagle and Fish Lips. I didn't have any real trouble, except I <br/>
was unsure which direction to start out on the trail to the Welcome to <br/>
Eagle box, and then I had trouble figuring out the right picnic table for <br/>
the Fish Lips box. (Aryn -- You might want to clarify the clues for those two.)<br/>
<br/>
I also found Initial Point, Bird's Eye, Star, and Another Star, all in good <br/>
shape. I had to make a second trip to find Der Mad Stamper's Raptor <br/>
Letterbox, but was finally successful and also picked up the Wherever Corn <br/>
Grows hitchhiker at the same time. There is a geocache a couple of feet <br/>
away from the Raptor letterbox, and I saw in the logs that a number of <br/>
geocachers have found the letterbox, and a number of letterboxers have <br/>
found the geocache. (I did clean out the items that the geocachers left in <br/>
the letterbox.) The Raptor's plastic container is broken on the bottom, but <br/>
the contents were all in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed the Initial Point/Decision Point/Swan Falls area -- it was <br/>
beautiful and windy and sunny and cloudy and rainy, with beautiful vistas <br/>
all around -- and sleet even fell at one point while I was on top of <br/>
Initial Point. One observation about people in Idaho -- they are very <br/>
careful drivers! Throughout Boise, I was surprised at how few people ever <br/>
exceeded the speed limit (I guess all those speed bumps have trained them <br/>
well!). But even out on the back roads, miles from the nearest town, most <br/>
people observed the 50 mph posted speed limits on endless stretches of <br/>
straight roadway. (They certainly don't drive like that in the Northeast!)<br/>
<br/>
I think my totals for the trip are 18 letterboxes, 1 hitchhiker, 4 <br/>
benchmarks and 8 geocaches. And I still had time to take care of the <br/>
business that brought me to Idaho in the first place!<br/>
