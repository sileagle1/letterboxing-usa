of those that want to participate and wait for the names to pour in (They will, Our's, Aztec Gold, filled to 77 <br/>
within 3 days) and then put together, there's a tutorial at my website here: <br/>
<br/>
http://www.myndworx.com/modules.php?name=content&amp;pa=list_pages_categories&amp;cid=3<br/>
<br/>
that will explain how I did it.  Then you send it out and hope that everything goes well, just like when your child <br/>
first goes off to school.  Settle back and await the responses from the people that joined it.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as far as Adopting a letterbox, if it was listed as "Abandoned" in the LbNA database and it was near you, and <br/>
contacting the placer didn't work, then you adopt it and take over maintaining it.  In my case, we adopted several of <br/>
Sun Seeker's boxes and watched over them for awhile till her returned and took over the care and maintenance again.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>

<br/>
Create a letterbox.  Announce here (or elsewhere) that you've created<br/>
a postal box and it will only go out to X people.  Boxers who want to<br/>
participate will send you their mailing addresses.  Put the first X<br/>
submissions you receive on a list, and mail it (with the list!) to the<br/>
first person on the list.  When it arrives, they'll stamp in it just<br/>
as if it was a regular box (and perhaps even hide a hitchhiker with<br/>
it!) and send it to the next person on the list.  The last person on<br/>
the list sends it back to you.  It's great for the winter months when<br/>
the regular boxes are buried in snow and ice.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Also, how or why does one adopt a Letterbox?  Thanks!!!<br/>
<br/>
Because the original placer has moved out of the area or the box was<br/>
planted while on vacation.  You treat it like one of your own<br/>
plantings, replace worn baggies, dry it out when wet, add a new<br/>
notebook full it's full, etc.<br/>
