The site seems to be down right now so I was wondering if anyone knew <br/>
if there were letterboxes on Shelter Island, NY?<br/>
I'm going to be there for a month doing archaeological work  and <br/>
wanted to see if there were any stamps that I could get during this <br/>
time<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Don't think so, Jocelyn...but there are two at Orient Point, not too <br/>
far from where you'll take the ferry to SI .  The Turtle Crossing <br/>
letterbox in the State Park by Orient Point was reported missing.  <br/>
It's a real easy walk once in the Park, so if you make it there, it <br/>
might be worth a try.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy Shelter Island.  I've haven't been over there since I was a <br/>
kid, but I hear it's still pretty remote and beautiful.  Protect <br/>
yourself from the deer ticks if it's the season because they're <br/>
pretty prevalent over there.<br/>

Thanks for the info...I'll be traipsing across on the ferry a few <br/>
times on the weekends since I'll be digging all week long. I HATE <br/>
ticks, yuck yuck yuck. lol<br/>
Maybe I"ll catch the ones at Orient Point on my way to the city<br/>
