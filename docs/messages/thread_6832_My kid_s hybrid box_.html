&gt; Being somewhat of a newbie myself, I would've thought for sure that <br/>
&gt; someone as seasoned in letterboxing as you would've recognized what <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; hybrid box is and consists of.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just in case you don't though... A hybrid box is a combination of a <br/>
&gt; Geo-cache AND a letterbox.  It seems that the owner of this box <br/>
chose <br/>
&gt; to share the geo-cache contents in the post AND since it is a <br/>
hybrid <br/>
&gt; letterbox presumed that readers on the letterbox boards would know <br/>
&gt; that there is a stamp and log in the box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I can be of any more assistance, just let me know.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I don't see a log book and stamp listed??<br/>
