                RINGS IN HEAVEN<br/>
<br/>
   On the Summer Solstice of 2000, I lost someone very<br/>
dear to me. On June 21, 2000 my mother lost her battle<br/>
with cancer. She joined my father who died 8 years<br/>
prior. There was always an evident loss on my mothers<br/>
face after that day in 1992, but it was gone the day<br/>
she left us. This box is placed in honor of my parents<br/>
memory.<br/>
   Drive to Brunswick, ME. and after parking at Cabot<br/>
Mill on the corners of Routes 24, 201 and 1 enjoy a<br/>
day of shopping,eating and antiquing in this small gem<br/>
of an old New England mill village, where one can find<br/>
the Beautiful Ivy League Campus of Bowdoin College. <br/>
   When you've gotten your fill of spending money<br/>
return to the parking lot at Cabot Mill to walk south<br/>
down Route 1 to the pedestrian suspension bridge.<br/>
Enjoy the views, while you feel the bridge sway<br/>
beneath your feet. At the end of the bridge turn right<br/>
down a grassy path framed by antique Black Walnut<br/>
trees, towering majesticly overhead. Enjoy the many<br/>
species of birds: woodpeckers, finches, cardinals,<br/>
orioles, jays, hawks and ospreys just to name a few<br/>
that I saw. <br/>
   Continue walking down this path, surronded by the<br/>
aroma of the Multi-flora Roses, to a grassy clearing,<br/>
before you come to a chain link fence, to find a 1 ft.<br/>
square concrete brick that has been painted yellow.<br/>
Roll this over to find your reward. On your way back<br/>
to your car, the same way you came, remember that 50<br/>
years ago two teenagers from up the road "Lisbon Way"<br/>
would come down to this village and spend it in  much<br/>
the way that you just did.<br/>
<br/>
