a series of 3 letterboxes in the Washington DC metro area: have fun<br/>
with them!<br/>

ï»¿Kid Gloves<br/>
<br/>
Rock Creek Park is a jewel of an urban green space that is a safe and<br/>
well opulated respite from city life. There are three letterboxes on<br/>
this 3.5 mile loop hike, which follows the Rock Creek, Normanstone, and<br/>
Dunbarton Oaks Trails.<br/>
<br/>
Using the clean and efficient Washington DC Metro system, take the Red<br/>
Line to the Woodley Park/National Zoo Station in Bethesda-Chevy Chase<br/>
MD. At the station's entrance, turn left briefly to the sidewalk, and<br/>
then right (south) on Connecticut Ave. If you would prefer to drive,<br/>
park your car in the National Zoo area on Connecticut Ave and continue<br/>
a block or two south to pick up the hike at the Metro Station. Heading<br/>
south on Connecticut Ave from the Metro, cross at the first light and<br/>
then bear right (before the large bridge over Rock Creek Park) on a<br/>
paved path with steps down, crossing carefully over an on-ramp, into<br/>
the park to an exercise station on the Rock Creek Trail.<br/>
<br/>
Turn right, west, on the paved Rock Creek Trail, and just before it<br/>
crosses the creek on a footbridge, turn right onto the singletrack<br/>
Parkway Trail. Walk up and over a small hill and then travel along ten<br/>
feet above the creek in a level stretch with smooth-barked beech trees<br/>
on either side. Before the trail bends slightly to the left, at the<br/>
biggest creek side beech, find the Rock Creek Letterbox just off the<br/>
trail behind an oak tree with a furry vine on your right.<br/>
<br/>
Continue a short way to the Normanstone Trail at a small footbridge. Go<br/>
right (north) on this orange blazed trail. A short way up the trail,<br/>
turn left for a bit of pleasant road walking, with the trail blazes<br/>
continuing conspicuously on the telephone poles. Passing the Cameroon<br/>
Embassy, jog right on Normanstone Drive with the blazes. Just past<br/>
30-31st Streets, cut left with the blazes back onto a foot path in the<br/>
woods. Climb a small hill, and in a flat area before climbing a little<br/>
more, find the Normanstone Letterbox just off the trail to the right<br/>
(northwest) behind a large dark-bark red oak tree.<br/>
<br/>
Finish climbing the hill a short way to cross busy Massachusetts Ave,<br/>
and follow the blazes straight past the British Embassy. To the right<br/>
is the historic Naval Observatory, and you'll soon pass the New Zealand<br/>
Embassy with its Maori statuary. Continue on to walk straight up to an<br/>
intimidating looking Naval Observatory gate, and follow the trail, less<br/>
prominently marked, but obviously there (and confirmed for us by a<br/>
nearby Secret Service agent!), right along the outside of the fence<br/>
line. Shortly emerge behind apartments and offices to a trail junction.<br/>
Turn left, southeast, on the Dunbarton Oaks Trail towards Rock Creek.<br/>
Down through an open area just smothered in Kudzu, a<br/>
regrettably-introduced creeper, and through an old chain ink gate,<br/>
you'll find a left turn on a side trail up some stairs which is blazed<br/>
in green. Follow this path to an open grassy area with a lovely side<br/>
path going right down to some park benches. Continue straight a short<br/>
distance with the blazed trail to turn right by a concrete park bench.<br/>
The Dunbarton Oaks Letterbox lives under the northern corner of this<br/>
bench. Linger here, or a few steps farther down<br/>
the trail as you please.<br/>
<br/>
Finishing your boxing adventure in DC, continue down the path through<br/>
the benches and over a small stone bridge. Pass through the gates and<br/>
jog left-right to continue east with the blazes and down along a small<br/>
creek. Cross a footbridge and travel down to Rock Creek. Follow the<br/>
path left, upstream, under the huge arched bridge carrying<br/>
Massachusetts Ave, back past the Normanstone Trail  intersection and to<br/>
the beginning.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Near this loop in about 1906, a newly arrived French diplomat named<br/>
Henri Jusserand was hiking with the great outdoorsman, President<br/>
Theodore Roosevelt. When it came time, he reluctantly forded the creek<br/>
by following the President's lead. Writing home of the incident, he<br/>
said: "I, too, for the honor of France, removed my apparel, everything<br/>
except my lavender kid gloves. The President cast an inquiring look at<br/>
this as if they, too, must come off, but I quickly forestalled any<br/>
remark by saying, `With your permission, Mr. President, I will keep<br/>
these on; otherwise it would be embarrassing if we should meet ladies.'"<br/>

Now, there is a subject for yet another letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
You guys are amazing - perhaps we could encourage Smithsonian to feature<br/>
you (the Clan) in a follow-up?<br/>
<br/>
And, what is the chance that you could sneak a box someplace in or<br/>
around the Smithsonian?<br/>
<br/>
Have a good Thanksgiving<br/>
(No, you can't stuff the bird with a chestnut-letterbox!)<br/>
