                    <div class="plaintext-content">As for the off road time, I still think it's not a problem to at least<br/>
specify the following categories:<br/>
<br/>
1. Driveby (DB): meaning:  Very near  the road or parking area.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Short walk (ShW): Less than an hour<br/>
<br/>
3.  Long walk (LW): 2 to 3 hours<br/>
<br/>
4.  Extended hike (EH): 1/2 day plus<br/>
<br/>
Another angle has also occurred to me.  It's just as important to let <br/>
the searcher know that they'll always be close to the car as not.  <br/>
I'm updating Stone Needle to include the statement that the searcher <br/>
should never be more than a few minutes from a parking lot.  If <br/>
there's a clue that only says to look for a landmark with no <br/>
distance, a searcher may miss and go in a long direction.<br/>
<br/>
As I already stated, I knew the chances I was taking and my little <br/>
adventure on Saturday was no one else's fault but my own.  That was <br/>
the whole "Midlife Crisis" connection.  However, my plea is one of <br/>
compassion for the greenhorn.  Just because your right isn't going to <br/>
bring a hypothermia victim back to life.  Also, from my business law <br/>
courses, I know that disclaimers are not always foolproof.  They have <br/>
their limitations.  If you're the worse driver in the world, <br/>
plastering your car with signs that say, "Not responsible for any <br/>
accidents that happen with this car" isn't going to do you much <br/>
good.  If somebody perishes in the woods while searching for a box <br/>
with your name and address in it or with clues from your website on <br/>
their person, see what good those disclaimers will do for you!  A <br/>
good lawyer can drill holes through any disclaimer.<br/>
<br/>
Government land managers are very hypersensitive about liability.  If <br/>
a casualty or accident occurs with the slightest connection to <br/>
letterboxing they will hunt them down and destroy them.  They will <br/>
also fine anyone they catch doing it.  I alluded to this in April in <br/>
the "Letterboxing in National Parks" Thread.  I just heard a story <br/>
about a man who was walking through the Gettysburg Monument with his <br/>
head down watching where he was going.  A Park Ranger accused him of <br/>
looking for artifacts and gave him a $100 fine.  Don't think, it <br/>
isn't possible for letterboxing to be declared an incompatible <br/>
activity.  Remember, Government agencies and their law systems are <br/>
the hardest of all to fight.<br/>
<br/>
I was YCC camp director at a state park one summer.  We had a very<br/>
liability-conscious superintendent.  You'd be surprised at all the <br/>
seemingly harmless activities that were curtailed because of it.<br/>
<br/>
I get just as impatient with leading greenhorns by the hand as anyone <br/>
else.  I'm not protecting them, I'm protecting letterboxing.  People <br/>
have sued the state and won settlements because a dead tree fell on <br/>
them.  If somebody has an accident on state or federal lands, the <br/>
government will surely want to share the blame.  If they can't <br/>
they'll say no to the activity.  Remember, Groups like the Boy Scouts <br/>
have insurance. <br/>
<br/>
Ever since I wrote my suggestions for letterboxing on public lands, <br/>
I've seen nothing concrete come of it.  Just some "warm fuzzy" lip <br/>
service.  If you're looking for a hobby the requires no <br/>
accountability, you should consider collecting postage stamps and not <br/>
the ones in letterboxes.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You are correct that a mere disclaimer will not slow down legal action for<br/>
very long.   I don't see how adding time or distance specific instructions<br/>
will go much beyond that.  Certainly it gives the letterboxer additional<br/>
knowledge, but, as with all boxes, the ultimate responsibility lies with the<br/>
person who is on the trail.  Letterboxing has never been advertised as<br/>
"easy."  The site disclaimer makes that pretty plain.<br/>
