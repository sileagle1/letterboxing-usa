he is great. The 4 year old has been boxing with us since 2003 and he has had his ups and <br/>
downs. He loves hiking but can't stand sitting around waiting until we find the box. He is <br/>
becoming more interested in finding, but it is still a hard sell sometimes. I got him his own <br/>
logbook and I carved him a sig stamp which he LOVES. He really enjoys stamping in the <br/>
logbooks, so I try to focus on that too.<br/>
<br/>
Heloves to check on my boxes, though. He knows where they are all hidden and he'll ask <br/>
me if we should go to such and such a place to make sure the letterbox is OK. It is so <br/>
funny!<br/>
<br/>
I think there are a lot of boxes that are not appropriate for kids (the hike and/or location) <br/>
but I just wait for those until Grandma comes to visit...unless she wants to box too as she <br/>
is a letterboxer herself!<br/>

etc. and helping him see interesting sites.  Most letterboxes are put <br/>
in interesting or education locations.  We felt this was an ideal <br/>
family hobby.  Our son has yet to learn to enjoy the challenge and <br/>
that the journey is the destination rather than the goal of the box <br/>
and stamping the book, so he misses alot on the way at times.  Our son <br/>
is nine, and we've been doing this about a year.  He has his own book, <br/>
stamp and ink pad -- fanny pack for short trips and small hiking pack <br/>
for longer trips.  Eventually we hope to work him up to hiking day <br/>
trips and then overnight trips ;)<br/>

we've used a baby carrier or backpack for a young one, or just found <br/>
quick, short hikes to do. We're getting to a place now where we can go <br/>
out and do 1-2 mile hikes on easy terrain and even the three year old <br/>
does just fine. As long as we rest and have plenty of water and some <br/>
snacks, the kids have fun. This is a great family hobby, have fun!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Letterboxing with kids is why we got started letterboxing.   I introduced it <br/>
to my kids back in '99 at a birthday party by hiding one in our yard: "Slices <br/>
of Quince."  Its still there then I hid sseveral in the area (one is still <br/>
there CMT at the local library).  The most fun was a five series box at the local <br/>
park - its no longer there but it was a lot of fun.  Photos of it are posted <br/>
on the LBNA kids page.  [ Those are not all my kids - they include friends and <br/>
neighbors ]<br/>
<br/>
Since then we always letterbox while on vacation (or geocache when there are <br/>
no letterboxes around) - we attempted to find boxes at Valley Forge, Liberty <br/>
Island, Osage FOrt in Mo, near Mount Rushmore, the badlands and Devils Tower.  <br/>
Letterboxing has taken us places we would not normally have gone with the <br/>
kids!  We've had a lot of fun family and friend adventures!<br/>

thought is was hokey but part of the fun was looking for the supplies (shopping). <br/>
One letterbox instructed the finders to go inside the library to say hello to <br/>
the librian. They did so reluctantly but came out with a great smile as the <br/>
nieces told the libraians about another box on the library property. It was good <br/>
news to them.<br/>
<br/>
The nieces also thought it was funny when the ranger came looking for us to <br/>
let us know the gates were being locked.<br/>
<br/>
The nieces are now looking forward to coming back to Connecticut and we will <br/>
continue as I kept their "stuff" here. <br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to the end of July when my friends sons get back from a <br/>
trip and the three boys and I will go letterboxing. I talked it up and they <br/>
are looking forward to our adventures that will include a picnic. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My daughter and I started letterboxing when she was 6. She's about to  <br/>
turn 9 now and we're still out there. :-) We were unsuccessful on our  <br/>
very first box, which was a good lesson - she really gets that it's  <br/>
about the hike and the box may or may not be there. She really does  <br/>
like having her own stamp, but if there are several of you, maybe you  <br/>
could use a group stamp and let them take turns stamping in if that's  <br/>
easier for you. My daughter has learned a lot over the years, but I  <br/>
do still make it my responsibility to make sure the box is re-hidden  <br/>
well and such. We've had a lot of fun and met a lot of great people,  <br/>
including other boxing families, and I'd vote for taking the kids.  <br/>
It's really a great family activity.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I started boxing with my kids about three years ago, with the baby in the<br/>
backpack.  They are now  9, 7 and 4 and enjoy  easy hikes in interesting<br/>
places-I am the one who is addicted :-)  My kids enjoy exploring the trails<br/>
and meeting other boxers the most.  Following the clues and finding the box<br/>
are secondary.  Stamping in holds minimal appeal, although they do like<br/>
having their own log books.  IF you are  into scrapbooking or<br/>
photojournaling at all, my kids love to  look through our  albums and recall<br/>
the different adventures.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I want to echo the  suggestions of others-take time to make sure the hikes<br/>
and boxes you are choosing are kid appropriate; be sure to focus on the<br/>
adventure as finding the box is  not guaranteed, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also want to emphasize the importance of  Letterboxing etiquette and<br/>
safety.  Read about it before starting out on your first adventure.<br/>
Remember that  discretion is key (Most kids love the "spy" aspect) and be<br/>
sure to  retrieve and rehide boxes yourself, or at least supervise the older<br/>
ones' efforts.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You might also want to search the archives for posts specific to kids, join<br/>
the new boxers list, and/or sign up for the boxing with kids board on<br/>
Atlasquest.  I know I learned a lot AFTER I started  that I wish I had known<br/>
before and was very lucky not to commit some major breaches of etiquette.<br/>
For example,  Baby wipes leave a scent on boxes that can attract animals.<br/>
(as, obviously, do peanut butter covered fingers :-))<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy-it is  a cooler day here in the Midwest so we are  hoping to grab a<br/>
nearby box before the heat returns!<br/>

My husband and I are considering venturing into the world of <br/>
Letterboxing with our children we have 3 boys: 16, 7 and 5. I have <br/>
read through some of the posts but haven't come across any that <br/>
reference LB(ing) with kids. If any of you are sharing this hobby <br/>
with your children please share your experiances! <br/>

Peace,<br/>

you can do is ask.<br/>
<br/>
Since you're a librarian, have you scouted out book stores in your town and<br/>
surrounding towns?<br/>
<br/>
Large corporations, like Barnes &amp; Noble or Borders Books, might not be<br/>
ecstatic to give permission.  Tho they might be.  Can't hurt to approach<br/>
their managers.  But if you have any smaller independent book stores, that<br/>
sell either new or used books, a lot of the owners of those stores are often<br/>
glad to give permission.  They're often art-oriented people themselves.<br/>
Plus a letterbox can get potential customers walking thru the door.<br/>

There is a small Library in Middlefield, CT that has two letterboxes on their <br/>
property. One of the boxes directs the finder to go inside the library to say <br/>
hello to a librarian.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure about other places but I would think that a series of library <br/>
or museum related boxes would be quite fun.<br/>
