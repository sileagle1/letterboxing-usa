                    <div class="plaintext-content">My wife and i started with a store bought stamp.we picked one stamp out for the both of us and we like it so much we're going to stick with it.we even came up a nick name for it that we thought was funny the needeeps.i just carved out my first stamp the other day and for a first try i don't think it came out half bad.remember not everyone has artistic talent and this should be fun for everybody.for us it's not all about stamps it's about getting out in nature.the other day something happened to us on a trail that i never seen before.their was a fawn,well a yearling it still had some fadded spots on it right in the middle of the path.i bent over and leaned forward and walked and talked real soft right up to it.i could not believe it,i stretched out my arm and he stretched his neck and i almost touched his nose but my canteen slipped off my shoulder and down my arm and off he went.it was almost like a petting zoo but no cage it was great and it's something we'll never forget.the stamps are great carved or not but so is discovering new places and meeting nice people.  P.S coming soon Fawn in the forest letterbox lol.   <br/>
