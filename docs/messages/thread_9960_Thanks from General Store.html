It has a indoor letterbox and we sat down over  a sandwich and <br/>

is such a warm friendly location complete with coffee and hot soup.  <br/>
The folks at the store are very happy hosting the letterbox and often <br/>

oops both Bluebird and I thought the other was reporting that The Great Escape
box had in truth escaped. It was not in it hiding spot, although the 'covers'
were there. I almost stepped on it covered by snow  about 4 feet from the
tree.!  We tried to get all the ice and snow cleaned off and so Happy that
Leader of the Pack came after us to pat it dry when the ice melted. Thanks.
