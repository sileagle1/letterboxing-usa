Please send comments regarding this box to:  blee@pobox.com<br/>
<br/>
Please park legally when you hunt this box.  There is 2 hour free <br/>
parking available in many places around the start point although <br/>
this is a VERY popular area (Thursdays-Sundays 10am-3pm in Spring &amp; <br/>
Summer).  There is also paid parking all around, too.  Park legally <br/>
and it will only add to a very enjoyable outing in a neat little <br/>
spot within our state.  Mostly flat surfaces (though not always <br/>
level), great for kids, about 1-1/2 miles roundtrip.  Bathrooms &amp; <br/>
water available along the trek.  Food, too!<br/>
<br/>
Begin in the state which bears a `1st President'ial name,<br/>
In the city with 7 letters (beginning and ending with vowels).<br/>
<br/>
Start by the basket within the beautiful garden of the Market of <br/>
Farmers???  Look for the flying pig.  Head toward him but don't <br/>
forget to first stop and smell the sweet flowers at the Hummingbird <br/>
Haven &amp; Butterfly Sanctuary.  Head 220 (but don't hit the <br/>
building).  Look for the bell.  Next seek the Triumph of Veggies!  <br/>
Turn 220 toward a green-`copper-topped' pergola.  Read about the <br/>
port in which you are present.  Continue 230 toward the floating <br/>
vessels.  Next, spy the Eagle on a pole near the Fiddlehead.  Look <br/>
North!  Eventually this will reopen and you can enjoy a great detour <br/>
to an awesome view of the area.  Back to the Eagle, go nearer to the <br/>
fountain of poles?  Continue along the boards.  Can you spot a <br/>
Whale's Tail?  Ohnice, sweet Motherhood.  Continue toward that <br/>
large building on the hill.  Let's Play!!!   Take a detour to the <br/>
blue-capped pergola to read about Percival and his landing.  Head <br/>
back to the walk of boardscontinuing toward the building with the <br/>
large rotunda.  Can you see the flying orca?  I didn't know they <br/>
could fly!  Next, spy `The Kiss'ers.  Oh no, traffic?  Carefully <br/>
cross the road and head toward the park of sporadic spouts (are <br/>
there orcas under this place???).  (this may not always be operating<br/>
as it's occasionally down for maintenance during the day and always <br/>
on Weds).  Locate the info sign closest to the dolphin.  I'm near <br/>
its left base.  <br/>
<br/>
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE be very inconspicuous when you seek me out.  <br/>
This is a very popular &amp; public place.  A few small children or a <br/>
very large backpack could serve you extremely well when `poking' <br/>
around in this spot.  What a lovely place for a snack or a picture <br/>
ora stamp exchange???  J  <br/>

evening of the 24th.  Sure I would be first, but...<br/>
<br/>
Eliza B was there earlier in the day.  Oh well, can't win them all.<br/>
<br/>
After locating the box and going to a spot to log in, heard sirens <br/>
coming toward me.  A little panic, what did I do to deserved being <br/>
visitied by the police?  Turned out it was just a fire engine heading <br/>
for a call.  Thankfully!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a enjoyable stroll!<br/>

this letterbox.  If you only knew how nervous we were placing the <br/>
box that day!!!  We kept looking around to see if anybody was paying <br/>
attention and I finally convinced my 3 year old to hide the box for <br/>
me!  We placed it during a very HOT day and there were several dozen <br/>
kids playing around the area...  I'm glad you enjoyed your hunt!!!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail...<br/>
