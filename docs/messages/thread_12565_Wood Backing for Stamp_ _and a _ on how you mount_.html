                    <div class="plaintext-content">I also went to Home Depot for my wood.  The precut stuff at Roberts and<br/>
Michaels was very overpriced for the amount of wood it gave you.  Plus, you<br/>
can't vary your size easily.  I instead bought a strip of 2"-3" wood and a<br/>
strip of 1.5" wood then I can saw off a piece with one simple cut using a<br/>
small handsaw (I live in a condo, no room for powertools or big saws).<br/>
<br/>
Let me ask you all a question.  I have no problem with the wood for<br/>
mounting, but what kind of glue do you use for mounting the stamp to the<br/>
wood.  I am afraid that my choice of glue over time could possibly eat into<br/>
the rubber of the stamp.  Any thoughts from those who would know better than<br/>
me?<br/>

Although we've only created our own sig stamps so far, we went to the<br/>
Home Depot lumber aisles and found plenty of small boards (about 2'-<br/>
3') for hobbies/crafts in varying thicknesses and of various types.<br/>
They are pretty cheap (maybe cheaper than pre-cut blocks from<br/>
specialty stores?).<br/>

I have had very good results securing my stamps to oak pieces with <br/>
latex-based contact cement.  The latex variety is safe for plastic, <br/>
rubber, leather, fabric, wood, etc., whereas the solvent-based type <br/>
is stronger and may eat at the rubber over time.<br/>
<br/>
The important thing to remember when using contact cement is that you <br/>
have to let it "set" before bonding your pieces together.  For the <br/>
latex variety, the "set" time is generally 45-60 minutes, but be sure <br/>
to read the instructions for your brand (I use Elmer's).  If you <br/>
don't let it "set" before bonding the pieces, they will peel apart.<br/>
<br/>
Used properly, this gives a very strong bond that is safe for the <br/>
rubber and has held up to wear, water and temperature extremes (I am <br/>
in Michigan).<br/>
