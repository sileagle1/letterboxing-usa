                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our first attempt to locate this box failed last weekend.  After <br/>
today's second visit to this area, I, along with my ten year old son <br/>
and five year old daughter, finally found this letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
At this time of the year, the sun sets at 4:55pm.  We arrived in the <br/>
area at about 4:35pm.  This time we brought a flashlight so we could <br/>
continue our search in the twilight.<br/>
<br/>
Erich's clues were challenging.  Much of the area has similar terrain, <br/>
making the distinction of landmarks difficult.  On the way out of the <br/>
area we simply tried to identify all "fallen giants" with a "shoe" <br/>
nearby.  We got lucky, and using the flashlight, were able to spot the <br/>
letterbox hidden in its secret spot!<br/>
<br/>
What a nice stamp, Erich.  Thanks so much for making it.  We stamped <br/>
my stamp, one I made for my daughter, and my son's handmade lightning <br/>
bolt stamp in the log book.  I also wrote down the coordinates for a <br/>
"parasitic unpublished geocache" I left nearby.  There is a small cash <br/>
prize inside as a special award to the first finder.<br/>
<br/>
We're looking forward to your next Omaha area letterbox.  Please be <br/>
sure to post it here as soon as it's ready.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the adventure!<br/>
<br/>
Scott, Andy, and Emily.<br/>
