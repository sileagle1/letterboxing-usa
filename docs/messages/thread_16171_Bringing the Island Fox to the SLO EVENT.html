You know, I was just thinking about that this morning! WHAT is the <br/>
protocal? is it OK to do that? i.e. bring a stamp that was  supposed <br/>
to go fetch via clues to an event to share -does it ruin its status? <br/>
or does it have to only remain fetchable thru clues?  Thoughts <br/>
please? QUICKLY I will be car bound soon..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No Nuk! No Diablo Cheese allowed - can you hook up co2 cartridges to <br/>
the cheese packets? I did not see any rule against it.<br/>

I for one would like to think that attending our event would not <br/>
seriously damage anyone's status...  but that's not the kind of thing <br/>
I know much about.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I just think the Island Fox stamp has a cool story to go <br/>
with it right now and people would love to see it.<br/>

Dear Maddog and Company,<br/>
<br/>
And folks here can jump in with their two cents' worth, too. <br/>
<br/>
We are talking about bringing a former POW or POG (prisoner of <br/>
geocaching) stamp to an event and want to know if it is kosher? Come <br/>
on! Of course it is! <br/>
<br/>
Bring the nice fox to the event. Those here can choose to count it as <br/>
an F or an X or whatever they want. We would only like to celebrate <br/>
her return. Plus, Princess Lea should be here and she is a fox-lady, <br/>
too. Good energy! Of course the weinies are chicken-based so the fox <br/>
should like them.<br/>
<br/>
And I DO NOT irradiate any cheese, thank you very much. Harumph! <br/>
Anybody not voted yet on cheese racing poll, please get over there <br/>
and cast your ballot.<br/>
<br/>

Ok Fox is very flattered, I am sure She would love to attend. She is <br/>
timid but we will see her. I am sure. I put her with all the other <br/>
stuff that will get STUFFED into our BMW. We decided Our truck needs <br/>
brakes too badly to drive up with it. So we have to drive a smaller <br/>
car. This means NO off-road stroller that is a bummer.<br/>
<br/>
Ok on the cheese - you did not like my C02 inflation idea either <br/>
then I bet? Hey can you modify the packet with duct tape so the <br/>
rapid gas does not push the seam? Ok ok.. sorry! You never did <br/>
answer if you can eat the melted cheese, or at full inflation point <br/>
does it just burn up eventually messing up the grill?<br/>
