I am so glad to see this new guide come out and I will definitly be adopting<br/>
it myself. <br/>
<br/>
Just as and added note let me say this to those that wanted to get all bent<br/>
out of shape that I was upset about clues seeming misleading.  Anything on<br/>
clues is about interpretation and people interpret things differently. I<br/>
have seen people write that you are looking for an 8 foot rock when it is a<br/>
good 5 feet at best, I have seen people tell you to go south when they want<br/>
you to go north, all because we look at things differently. I am NOT and I<br/>
repeat I am NOT blaming anyone for my broken ankle (which is now a broken<br/>
foot too per the doctors appointment today) but myself. It was my own fault<br/>
that I planned a strenuous schedule for that day, it was my own fault that I<br/>
did not come down in time to hike back in the dark.... all I am saying is<br/>
that at first glance of the clues had I seen something telling me more<br/>
clearly what I was getting into -- the distance of the Mount Hollywood box,<br/>
or a little more emphasis on the boulder creek hopping terrain of the<br/>
Millard Falls box, I probably would not have planned as much and tried to do<br/>
as much as I did. I agree that I perhaps should have translated boulder<br/>
hopping and creek crossing to mean throughout the entire hike, however that<br/>
along with "an easy 1/2 mile hike" made me think it was not the length of<br/>
the entire 1/2 mile.  I really did not start the post nor the story to slam<br/>
anyone, I think it is wonderful that everyone is out there planting boxes<br/>
for all of us to find.  What I started the tread to do is to ask everyone to<br/>
take a little more time and be a little more clear about the conditions and<br/>
difficulty level of the hikes.  If that is too much to ask for all those<br/>
that got so bent they needed to email me and flame me.. the I apologize.  I<br/>
personally see letterboxing as one big happy family, had any of you e-mailed<br/>
me and said hey pandora, that last box was a bit hard and you might want to<br/>
change the clues a little to let someone know, I would say thank you and<br/>
consider altering the clues. (As a matter of fact I have done so before)...<br/>
perhaps that is my considerate and submissive nature, who knows... for those<br/>
of you that were offended by my request I apologize.<br/>

I just want to tell you that I hope that you are feeling better soon. <br/>
I totally understand where you are coming from and think if I didn't <br/>
have my husband to help me down some muddy hills that I could be hurt <br/>
too. I also think that some shoes with some traction would help also. <br/>
I agree that people need to be more sensitive when they post their <br/>
clues about the terrain. I know that I probably shouldn't be climbing <br/>
around in the woods when it is muddy but it seems to stay wet around <br/>
here these days. I plan on reading the clues more carefully before I <br/>
start out to find a box. Take care.<br/>
