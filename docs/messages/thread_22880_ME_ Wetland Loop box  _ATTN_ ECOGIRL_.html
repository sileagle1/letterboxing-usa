This is mostly directed to Choi, or others that might know of this<br/>
particular box. If you're not familiar with what I'm talking about,<br/>
just disregard. I don't usually read this list anymore, let alone<br/>
check the "what's new" but I happened to check the list and noticed<br/>
that there was a new listing for Wetland Loop.<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=19385&amp;boxname=Wetland_Loop<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's kinda funny because I originally planted a box in the<br/>
SAME location about 2 years ago for the Water District. This was a box<br/>
that you need to ask permission for since the Portland Water District<br/>
property is private and there is restricted access around Sebago Lake<br/>
which is also a drinking water source. I'm quite puzzled to see that<br/>
there is a listing for essentially the SAME clue that I wrote...<br/>
http://home.gwi.net/~moxie1/Clues/WetlandLoopTrail.html<br/>
<br/>
I'm puzzled and a bit bummed out, why don't people pay attention when<br/>
they plant boxes? Maine is not Connecticut folks, we don't need 50<br/>
boxes in the same location, on the SAME trail. Thankfully I am still<br/>
in good contact with the Education director at the Ecology Center and<br/>
will make her aware of this error in judgement.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, a bit disgruntled...<br/>
