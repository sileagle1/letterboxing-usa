<div> See directions for "Anniversary/Western Divide" letterbox. This is a 
three season box, winter brings snowy/icy conditions and this road is subject to 
closure. From Kernville head north along the Kern river and cross Johnsondale 
bridge.At 24 1/2 miles keep left and head toward Ponderosa and California Hot 
Springs. You will eventually come to a stop sign. Turn right toward Ponderosa 
and Camp Nelson. You will now be on the Western Divide Hwy. Pass by the Trail of 
100 Giants and the unmarked entrance to the "Anniversary/Western Divide" 
letterbox<span id="__#Ath#SignaturePos__"></span> . Turn right on the semi 
graded dirt road marked with a "Dome Rock" sign. The road should be passable for 
2 wheel drive cars. If it is not it's only 1/2 mile to Dome Rock.At the parking 
area look for the house shaped Forest Service posting board.From this posting 
board walk up hill 37 big guy paces at 160 degrees into a cluster of pine 
trees.Look for a rock slab leaning against a smallish pine tree trunk.( Don't be 
fooled by the first slab it is not enough paces !) The letterbox is under some 
movable rocks on the west side of the tree.If you are having difficulty look for 
a prone burned log. The letterbox is about 5 paces east of this log.After 
stamping in check out the fantastic view. EXTRA CAUTION, STANDING ON DOME 
ROCK IS LIKE STANDING ON TOP OF A LARGE BALL, YOU CAN ONLY WALK SO FAR BEFORE IT 
IS TOO FAR! Keep your dogs on leashes and small children in check. If you are a 
geocacher check for location of a nearby cache.</div>
<div>There are no restrooms here but Ponderosa Cafe is about 5 miles 
further up the main road for eats, gas and lodging.</div></body></html>
