You must have been way off on this one. There is no stone wall near this box. Maybe you were on the wrong side of the street. Glad everything went well for you at the MMM.

Thank you for everyone who worked so hard to make the MMM a great success and to those who placed all of those wonderful boxes-what an AWESOME job you'be done.<br/>
<br/>
On to the Dr. &amp; Mr. box-my family were doing the Mixed Monser Mania series yesterday (too many people at the gathering to do it last week) and we found every single box except for the Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde box.  I'm pretty sure that we searched all of the "piles of stones" and were unable to locate this box.  My husband thinks that someone had tried to disassemble the stone wall in that area to find this box, so we looked through the  "wall" and we left no area stone unturned and we still were unable to locate this box?  Any ideas where we might have missed this box?  I plan on being in the area next weekend to find more glorious monsters and could stop and try to locate this one too.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for the great gathering,<br/>
