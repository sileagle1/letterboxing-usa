<br/>
One of the problems for innocent hitchhikers is that they never know <br/>
what whacko will pull over and pick them up. I mean, picture a <br/>
chilling Woody Harrelson in Natural Born Killers, or that eerie "zoom <br/>
zoom" kid in the Mazda commercials....what's a thumbing letterbox to <br/>
do?<br/>
<br/>
Poor Firebolt! Picked up by an obsessed stalker, who crammed him <br/>
(her?) in a back pack and has been dragged all over New England while <br/>
the crazed kidnapper binged on end-of-season letterboxing. At first <br/>
the perpetrater was afraid to let Firebolt out to stamp-up, because <br/>
being a FAST broomstick, the weirdo didn't want any escapes. But <br/>
lately Firebolt is calming down a little, maybe having some of that <br/>
hostage-affiliation thing, or maybe just waiting for a chance to <br/>
escape, so he's been let out to stamp-in to a few spots. So far, <br/>
Firebolt has visited:<br/>
<br/>
The Books, Airstream, Fete de Jardin, Trolley Car, Blue Hills, City <br/>
Lights, Sea Coast-Great Bay-Postcard from Maine (new in NH/ME and not <br/>
online yet), the Mt Pisgah Fledglings, Golden Thimble, and Powder <br/>
House Hill and First Born (in Bolton MA).<br/>
<br/>
Today his captors hope to drag him to a couple of the RI Quest <br/>
Letterboxes. Who knows where he'll end up?<br/>

try to fit all THAT on his hh-update page)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Jay,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome back. It sounds like you had a great week. I'll be waiting to <br/>
get your NH/ME clues. That may not be too far for me to take a one <br/>
day trip. I realy enjoyed hiking Monadnock last Sunday. I can see why <br/>
you all enjoy it so much. A lot of rock for just 3000 feet. The <br/>
Sarcophagus is amazing. Just like Melissa wrote in the journal - you <br/>
start to feel a little doubtful as you wander farther on down the <br/>
Pampenelly (sp?) Trail, but when you spot it ahead, you know.<br/>
<br/>
I was shut down from sover.net last week-end with a worm/Trojan <br/>
Horse, so I only worked one day on updating the What's New page. I <br/>
may have missed something over the week-end - I had a ton of e-mail <br/>
to sift though when I finally got reconnected. The only one I know is <br/>
not on is yesterday's new KY box, which Jay got posted.<br/>
<br/>
I am starting to look forward to the Fall gatheiing a lot. If the <br/>
week-end of Nov 1 works for you, I believe that is the one that would <br/>
work for Randy - at least for him to drop by. But it's maybe even <br/>
more to the point to try to make it work for Jay Chamberlin. But make <br/>
it work for your family, first of all!! Thanks for doing this work.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know where John is at now. He must be upset about something - <br/>
he could have just asked if one of us could cover for him for a <br/>
while. You sensed this a few weeks ago, I remember. John tends to <br/>
react really quickly, without counting to 10, so maybe he'll come <br/>
around. I would feel bad if he left. <br/>
<br/>
I think your Harry Potter theme is fantastic. You have inspired me to <br/>
work on a Tolkien theme, building on Frodo's Dream Look for Gandalf's <br/>
Rune to come out in a mystery location this fall, along with a <br/>
Palintir hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
I'm behind in posting hh info. I haven't even gottten the updates <br/>
that you sent to me two weeks ago. As for Firebolt, I'm pleased to <br/>
hear it's had such fine adventures. I couldn't tell from your letter <br/>
if you were stamping Firebolt into the boxes you were visiting, or <br/>
just letting me know where YOU had been. I'm guessing the latter, <br/>
since stamping a hitchhiker into a journal of a non-hostel box could <br/>
confuse the record. Or am I confused?<br/>
<br/>
Please give my best regards to your family. And is there a chance <br/>
you'll make a Vermont trip before November?<br/>

started this thread. It was a week or more after he had posted it, <br/>
and somehow I thought it was addressed to me. After I sent it, I <br/>

have made such a slip.<br/>
<br/>
I referred to both John and Randy in the post. I told them afterwards <br/>
I didn't think I had said anything about them that I thought was <br/>
especially negative or for which I felt I had to apologize. But I <br/>
think now that I should have apologized to the list - if only for <br/>
having made the slip up. I do apologize for that, and also if the <br/>
substance of what I said was hurtful to either of you, John or Randy.<br/>

On a positive note, some of the acrimony which came  from <br/>

get dragged down by the tedium (and the medium), but we all love the <br/>

of us.<br/>

<br/>
Well, happy hunting, and don't get too wrapped up inthe web-site that you lose sight of why you do this. As a retailer, I remind myself every day, of why I do what I do. Providing a conduit (or number of conduits) for people to "go outside and play" is why I work where I work. It is also why I promote letterboxing so heavily. Relax, have fun with it. No one means to hurt anyone's feelings I'm sure. Definitely time for an LBNA gathering. Any word on when and where?<br/>
