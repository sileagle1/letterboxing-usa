<br/>
We're officially putting out a 'LAST CALL' for contributions to this year's tour of the Traveling Exhibit of Letterboxing Patches.<br/>
<br/>
Those who attended the 'We Live and Breathe Letterboxing' event last summer already got a partial glimpse at this historical collection; however, it has grown CONSIDERABLY since then!<br/>
<br/>
We are finishing up the construction of a new and improved portable display, and we're making final arrangements for the exhibit to appear at several major letterboxing events this summer, including LB Con 2009.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are still a couple of people who have indicated that they want to donate event patches to the exhibit, so I've gotta let you know that TIME IS RUNNING OUT! If we don't receive them within the next several days, we simply won't be able to include them in the exhibit for this year's tour.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't know what this is all about, please visit http://www.WeLiveAndBreathe.com and click on the HISTORY link to view an online version of the exhibit. Be prepared to learn things you never knew before about letterboxing traditions!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of learning, we're also trying to document as much information about the history of each patch as possible. So just because you don't have a patch to donate doesn't necessarily mean you don't have anything to contribute. If you can fill in any details about a patch, or know about a patch that isn't depicted in our exhibit, please contact us as soon as possible! You will find our contact info on the website.<br/>
<br/>
We sincerely appreciate the efforts of those of you who have donated patches, provided information, or made financial contributions to this exhibit. You have helped us to preserve the history of letterboxing for generations to come! THANK YOU!!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch Klink (Der Mad Stamper)<br/>
