the Noland Trail that leads to the Mariners' Museum in Newport News.<br/>
We found three of the four boxes on the trail but unfortunately not<br/>
the third box. We found a hollow stump in the area specified but<br/>
nothing in it. Hopefully we truly weren't in the right place, but I<br/>
thought I'd pass along our findings for future boxers and for their<br/>
placer's info.<br/>
<br/>
The stamps that we DID find were really nicely carved. <br/>
<br/>
This was a lovely, thoughtfully designed trail. We saw lots of<br/>
turtles, ducks, and ducklings. In fact, we crossed one bridge<br/>
surrounded by at least 15 turtles floating around it. A dozen or so<br/>
ducks were hanging out on the bank and saw us standing in the center<br/>
of the bridge. They plowed into the water; they must have thought we'd<br/>
feed them. As they neared the turtles, they pecked their heads! The<br/>
turtles would calmly pull their heads inside their shells until the<br/>
ducks moved on, then they would pop their heads back out! Guess they<br/>
were used to the ducks wanting to hog all the bits of bread!<br/>
<br/>
We also saw a line of mother ducks and a bunch of babies floating<br/>
along as we crossed another bridge. Some of the ducks and ducklings<br/>
were brown and some were white, and it was charming to see the dozen<br/>
or so of them floating along in almost a straight line together.<br/>
<br/>
We saw a strange squirrel with a skimpy red tail. We were like, Hmmmm,<br/>
guess the squirrels are different in Newport News! The other squirrels<br/>
we saw were regular grey ones.<br/>
<br/>
We saw one heron when we were stamping into box 4.<br/>
<br/>
This was a heavily used park. Lots of joggers and dogwalkers. I mean,<br/>
what are the odds of seeing four dachshunds with their two separate<br/>
owners in one park in one day?!<br/>
<br/>
A great day trip for all in Richmond and NoVa!<br/>
