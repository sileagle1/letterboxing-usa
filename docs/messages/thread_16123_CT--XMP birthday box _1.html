After stamping in today, i left with my hands covered in blue ink. If you plan <br/>
to repair it, you should bring a new bag, and a different ink pad. Other than <br/>
that it was a nice double box trail. However, the directions were a little <br/>
difficult for the return trip, and because it was getting dark so quickly, i <br/>
didn't have time to find the bonus box. I will have to return on another day.<br/>
