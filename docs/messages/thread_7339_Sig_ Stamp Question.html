other 'boxers here regarding a question of signature stamp propriety:<br/>
<br/>
When I first started letterboxing (in May), I carved my first stamp <br/>
from a very old hard-rubber eraser (the only easer I could find at <br/>
the moment). My tools and my techniques (like my materials) really <br/>
weren't top-notch at the time. This little 'prototype' was actually <br/>
used in five boxes (two found, and three planted).<br/>
<br/>
About a month later, I managed to aquire some lovely art-gum erasers <br/>
(the little cubic ones), and practiced my carving until I had a new <br/>
stamp - of greater quality in terms of image and material - than the <br/>
first. You will note, though, that the image on the new stamp was <br/>
different from the one on the first! I (hesitantly) began to use this <br/>
new stamp. I've used it now for nine other boxes (three my own, six <br/>
found).<br/>
<br/>
Now, I've recently procured a block of marvelous Stradlaeter master-<br/>
carve and a very handy new x-acto knife. In addition, my skills at <br/>
carving have advanced again. Here's the question: can I change <br/>
signature stamps yet again? The image between stamp #2 and stamp #3 <br/>
(the new mastercarve one) will be nearly the same, but the new one <br/>
will be larger and more detailed. I always print my pseudonym in the <br/>
logbook as well, so the connection can still be made! Please don't <br/>
think that I intend to change signature stamps every few weeks - <br/>
indeed, I'm hoping that this new one will be the last.<br/>
<br/>
I would very much like for my signature stamp to reflect a certain <br/>
aesthetic standard and ability, but I'd hate to commit a letterboxing <br/>
faux pas (plus I'd like to know how everyone feels about this!).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is no reason why you can't change your sig stamp.  In fact, many<br/>
have over the years - or mearly carved new renditions as their carving<br/>
techniques have matured.  If you wish to carve a new stamp - or even<br/>
change your stamp all together - Go For It!<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have seen in some logs, is that once a new stamp has been<br/>
carved by a boxer - especially if it is a new image all together - they<br/>
have returned to boxes they found with their original stamp and<br/>
re-stamped in with their new image.  No, it doesn't count as another<br/>
find - but it can be a great excuse to go revisit some of your favorite<br/>
boxes ;o).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy, and happy boxin'!!<br/>

Go ahead and change your signature stamp if you'd like.  At least I<br/>
don't mind.  A couple people out here have changed their signature<br/>
stamps after they've hit the 100 mark, so I think you're free to do as<br/>
you please.  <br/>
<br/>
My mate originally used a commercial stamp until he found an image he<br/>
liked that he had me carve for him.  Probably others do the same type of<br/>
thing until they find an "identity" or better stamp that suits them<br/>
best.<br/>

&gt; There is no reason why you can't change your sig<br/>

&gt; have over the years - or mearly carved new<br/>

&gt; stamp - or even<br/>
&gt; change your stamp all together - Go For It!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One thing I have seen in some logs, is that once a<br/>
&gt; new stamp has been<br/>
&gt; carved by a boxer - especially if it is a new image<br/>
&gt; all together - they<br/>
&gt; have returned to boxes they found with their<br/>
&gt; original stamp and<br/>
&gt; re-stamped in with their new image.  No, it doesn't<br/>
&gt; count as another<br/>
&gt; find - but it can be a great excuse to go revisit<br/>
&gt; some of your favorite<br/>
&gt; boxes ;o).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Enjoy, and happy boxin'!!<br/>

Like you, for my first stamp I used an eraser I had around the house. <br/>
I set to trying to carve with a craft knife.<br/>
Once I bought one of those speedball tools and saw how much easier it <br/>
made things, I had to replace that initial attempt.<br/>
My little cavy still didn't come up as I'd imagined on this 2nd try, <br/>

changing sig. stamps is okay!<br/>

&gt; I should like to enlist (no pun intended) the advice of the <br/>
&gt; other 'boxers here regarding a question of signature stamp <br/>
propriety:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I first started letterboxing (in May), I carved my first stamp <br/>
&gt; from a very old hard-rubber eraser (the only easer I could find at <br/>
&gt; the moment). My tools and my techniques (like my materials) really <br/>
&gt; weren't top-notch at the time. This little 'prototype' was actually <br/>
&gt; used in five boxes (two found, and three planted).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; About a month later, I managed to aquire some lovely art-gum <br/>
erasers <br/>
&gt; (the little cubic ones), and practiced my carving until I had a new <br/>
&gt; stamp - of greater quality in terms of image and material - than <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; first. You will note, though, that the image on the new stamp was <br/>
&gt; different from the one on the first! I (hesitantly) began to use <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; new stamp. I've used it now for nine other boxes (three my own, six <br/>
&gt; found).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, I've recently procured a block of marvelous Stradlaeter master-<br/>
&gt; carve and a very handy new x-acto knife. In addition, my skills at <br/>
&gt; carving have advanced again. Here's the question: can I change <br/>
&gt; signature stamps yet again? The image between stamp #2 and stamp #3 <br/>
&gt; (the new mastercarve one) will be nearly the same, but the new one <br/>
&gt; will be larger and more detailed. I always print my pseudonym in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; logbook as well, so the connection can still be made! Please don't <br/>
&gt; think that I intend to change signature stamps every few weeks - <br/>
&gt; indeed, I'm hoping that this new one will be the last.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would very much like for my signature stamp to reflect a certain <br/>
&gt; aesthetic standard and ability, but I'd hate to commit a <br/>
letterboxing <br/>
&gt; faux pas (plus I'd like to know how everyone feels about this!).<br/>
