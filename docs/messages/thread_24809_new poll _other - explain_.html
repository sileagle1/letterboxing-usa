                    <div class="plaintext-content">I chose "other" too.  I nearly picked "plant near bike trails" since I do a lot<br/>
of my letterboxing by bicycle and I like those, but there's a less limiting and<br/>
more versatile option.  I would like to see the directions include public<br/>
transportation and/or bike directions included along with driving directions<br/>
(when appropriate, of course).  Something like this:<br/>
<br/>
By car: from I-5 take exit #___ and go south on ______ ...<br/>
<br/>
By bus: from downtown take #62, 64, or 66 to ______ and change to #68 to go<br/>
south on _______ ...<br/>
<br/>
By bike: from the downtown transit center, take the ______ Trail to the ______<br/>
trailhead and head south on ...<br/>
<br/>
I hope to plant my first box this summer and have planned all along to include<br/>
a non-car alternative.  It seems only right in a hobby that includes so many<br/>
hikers and admirerers of the outdoors.  <br/>
