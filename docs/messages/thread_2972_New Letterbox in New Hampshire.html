Here is the description:<br/>
<br/>
      Your trail begins at the trailhead for Black Cap Mountain near <br/>
North Conway, New Hampshire.  Black Cap Mountain trail is found off <br/>
Hurricane Mountain Road, which is located just north of North Conway <br/>
on Route 16.  The climb to the top is a 1.2 mile hike, with an <br/>
elevation gain of 700 feet.  It is a wonderful family hike, not too <br/>
strenuous.  We can usually make the top in 30-40 minutes.  <br/>
<br/>
      When you reach the top, locate the circle that marks the exact <br/>
summit!  Turn around and admire the view on all sides.  You should be <br/>
able to see Mount Washington, Kearsarge Mountain and Mt. Chocorua, <br/>
among others.  <br/>
<br/>
     Now, to find the letterbox, descend the steps at the southern <br/>
corner of the summit.  Set a path 200 degrees (southerly) and go <br/>
approximately 35 paces to stand in the open, sandy area.<br/>
<br/>
     Turn ESE at approximately 130 degrees, and proceed about 23 <br/>
paces.  Now face NE (60 degrees) and look about 15 feet away, under <br/>
the bush and greens.<br/>

     Good luck.<br/>

Black Cap is one of my 6 year old's favorite hikes when we are in <br/>
NH.  Of course he refers to it as "Black Fly Mtn" since the first <br/>
time we hiked it was in early June.  We belong to a ski house on <br/>
Hurricane Mtn Rd and have done it several times in spring and fall.  <br/>
Looking forward to our next trip up there to find the letterbox and <br/>
enjoy the great views.  <br/>
