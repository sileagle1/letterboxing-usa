                    <div class="plaintext-content">so, listening to everyone come up with all these crazy ideas about <br/>
where to put boxes, doesn't make me feel so weird. somehow i want to <br/>
place birdhouses in the woods and inside these houses would be <br/>
stamps. i am trying to figure out how that would work with out <br/>
playing with birds minds. i thought that if i put a few birdhouses <br/>
out in the woods and blocked off the house hole, so no birds <br/>
entered, then the placed stamp inside the birdhouse would be safe. <br/>
but then i thought about the poor birds. with the increase birdhouse <br/>
prices in the state, lol, i would hate for a bird to try and move in <br/>
and become disstressed with confusion. then i thought, well i could <br/>
place several birdhouses and then plant boxes near the trees the <br/>
birdhouses reside. is it a bad thing to place birdhouse in random <br/>
places or should i consider asking? i wouldn't consider placing <br/>
these birdhouse in parks run by towns or the state. i don't know <br/>
where i would place these houses yet, but i was thinking of placing <br/>
the birdhouses for boxing. and/or consider a birdhouse series like <br/>
wanda and pete's holiday ornament series, where other boxers can add <br/>
birdhouses/boxes to the series. what does everyone think?<br/>
