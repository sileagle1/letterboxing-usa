Clues from the web site:<br/>
<br/>
Sugarland Run Stream Valley Park is a long, thin park surrounding the <br/>
small creek that runs through it. Get on Route 7 and take to Route <br/>
7100, Fairfax County Parkway. Head South and turn Right at the first <br/>
road onto Sugarland Road (route 604). Take this all the way to the <br/>
end and park in the turn-around.<br/>

---------------<br/>
<br/>
There are two paths from here. A wide one that comes right up to the <br/>
road, and another, thinner bike trail on the left up the hill <br/>
slightly. Walk to the bike path and head right. Left takes you a <br/>
short distance to the actual start of the path about 300' behind you. <br/>
You are on the correct path if a pond appears on your left. At the <br/>
fork, go Left. You will pass a basketball court, the path with make <br/>
an "S" turn, then turn sharply right. Continue to a small stream with <br/>
stepping stones crossing it. Cross and continue a short distance to <br/>
where the path zig zags slightly with a tree that forks at its base, <br/>
immediately off the path on your right.<br/>
