I'll omit recent locals in favor of nostalgic spots.<br/>

10.  ME - "Almost There"  <br/>
9.   Opus #91<br/>
8.   Opus #31 <br/>
7. ME - "Wangor" <br/>
6. ME - "MHO" to be placed soon...<br/>
5. ME - "Baxter Woods Series" <br/>
4. ME - "Saco Heath boxes" <br/>
3. ME - "Cow Patty"  aka: cowhenge <br/>
2. CT - Sunny Brook State Park (??Rubaduc) this was my first find in winter<br/>
1. ME -"Bird Walk" my favorite walking spot and ocean viewing<br/>
<br/>
And on my list of interesting stories is a box from the rose park "Elizabeth Park" <br/>
in Hartford, Ct. Having previously lived in CT I was delighted to return to the <br/>
area in search of boxes. Well, it was one of those instances where the clue was <br/>
written so beautifully that it brought you around a scenic tour of the entire park <br/>
showing me places that I didn't even know (having lived nearby) and ultimately <br/>
finding the box just steps from where we initially began - and never even <br/>
realizing it until long afterwards. It was after this box that I began to understand <br/>
the fine art of writing a clue so that you enjoy the spot to the fullest! Thank you <br/>
to whomever planted that box - this story was long overdue!<br/>
