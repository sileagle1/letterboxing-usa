                    <html><body>What a fantastic day!  The ADG and two newbes, Greenman Dan and Daniel, boxed their hearts out at Patapsco Valley and came home with 10 finds and a hitchhiker.  
<br/>
<br/>The park was absolutely gorgeous and a great time was had by all.  Dan didn't quite understand why there were two stamps in the Quercus Alba box until we explained that he had just found a hitchhiker. Needless to say, happy dances ensued as we oohed and aahed over Vawaterbird's TSA Voyager Hitchhiker.   
<br/>
<br/>During our travels, we also placed the Devon hitchhiker and a new box.  This brings the total of boxes in the McKeldin area up to 11 so if you have not boxed this park, do so before all of the leaves fall and the temperature drops. The Bambis are as plentiful as the boxes!
<br/>
<br/>We are proud to announce that today's adventures put Sarah and Tammy over the PFX 100 count!  Sarah has a whopping 111 and I am bringing up the rear with 105.

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After locating Mary Jane Rathburn’s Find in Firefly’s Maryland, <br/>
My Maryland <br/>
&gt; series, take a right onto the purple and white blazed trail.  As <br/>
you take <br/>
&gt; this right onto the trail, start counting the blazes and count the <br/>
blaze at <br/>
&gt; your turn as number one.  At the fourth blaze, take a bearing of <br/>
355 and <br/>
&gt; eyeball the cave with the curved tree at its entrance.  Proceed <br/>
across the <br/>
&gt; field and up the hill to the entrance of the cave.  Be very quiet <br/>
while <br/>
&gt; retrieving this box as beyond the cave lives a creature so foul, a <br/>
great huge <br/>
&gt; monster with big, nasty teeth. Don’t be fooled by the white <br/>
fluffy tail, this <br/>
&gt; vile creature will bite your kneecaps off.  While peering into the <br/>
opening, <br/>
&gt; quaking with fear, make the rational decision and stay out of the <br/>
cave.  <br/>
&gt; Instead, look to the left and find the flat rock leaning up against <br/>
another <br/>
&gt; large rock.  The box is underneath the flat rock beneath the <br/>
international <br/>
&gt; letterboxing symbol of neatly arranged rocks and sticks.   <br/>
Quickly pantomime <br/>
&gt; remounting your horse and do not begin banging your coconuts <br/>
together until <br/>
&gt; you are out of earshot of the killer bunny.<br/>
