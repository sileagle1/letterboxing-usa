Hi there C/T/G. Have you considered carving a personal stamp of your <br/>
own? It sounds like the manufactured stamps you use don't exactly fit <br/>
what you are looking for (since you use two different ones). I know <br/>
of at least one case where two separate stamp images were later <br/>
combined into a single stamp that combined elements of both.<br/>
<br/>
I try not to be a stamp snob, but IMO a hand carved stamp is always <br/>
more interesting than the storebought variety.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to completely dodge your actual question. Happy boxing!<br/>

year.  I am very fond of my cat stamp. Re. the stores you named--nope <br/>
have not checked them.  I am a shopper phobic who avoids Manchester <br/>

The first letterbox I planted contains a handcarved stamp (carved by <br/>
my husband) based on my drawing. I'd carved one myself but it came <br/>
out horribly.  Perhaps this winter I could practice carving and come <br/>
up with something acceptable to present to the letterboxing public. I <br/>
want to create apersonal traveler stamp based on the Egyptian Goddess <br/>

It took me many long weeks of agonizing over my "signature stamp" before I <br/>
settled on a trail name and stamp that fit.  PHYTO is short for... marine <br/>
PHYTOplankton (for those on the list that were wondering). There is someone <br/>
listed as a member with the name: "SKELETONEMA" and that is a genus of a <br/>
phytoplankton ...I always wondered if someone had a similar background...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the best part about carving your own signature stamp - or having a <br/>
custom made one is that it is very unique and you can be certain that nobody <br/>
else has something like you; such as a phytoplankton on your stamp! I don't <br/>
think I've met anyone (yet) with a stamp such as mine. <br/>
