<br/>
I am starting up a website for Iowa letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
I already have the page started, but won't give out the URL until <br/>
there is more content.<br/>
<br/>
I want there to be a place where Iowans and visitors to Iowa will be <br/>
able to go to get clues to boxes in and around the state.<br/>
<br/>
I am totally new to this hobby, and have never found a box or placed <br/>
one, but on Saturday, I will be placing my first ever box in Tama, <br/>
Iowa.  I am going to the casino there and decided that would be a <br/>
good place to start.  This was also my first ever attempt at stamp <br/>
making.  It is a little crude.  I will post it on the new website.<br/>
<br/>
Just for practice I made a Sept. 11 tribute stamp with a picture of <br/>
the WTC towers.  Making stamps is fun and easy. The 'pink pearl' ones <br/>
are hard to carve (Tama) IMHO, I used a white eraser and zipped right <br/>
through the WTC stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, my goal with the website is to get Iowans interested in <br/>
Letterboxing.  It should work because this is Iowa and there isn't <br/>
anything better to do, so why not go letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Also, every box I place in Iowa will also be put in the LbNA <br/>
directory, since that seems to be the place to go.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone from Iowa on this board? <br/>
See you later,<br/>
<br/>
Chris <br/>
