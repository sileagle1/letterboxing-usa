mention that I finally got Pete to post our 2006 "Lifetime <br/>
Achievement Leterbox Award" report onto our webpage after work <br/>
today! It may be a little rough around the edges yet, but it's <br/>
available for viewing by going to the second part of number 127 on <br/>
the list of our plants at:<br/>
<br/>
http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html <br/>
<br/>
Hope I got it right this time. Otherwise, just go to any of our <br/>
boxes and click on the index to get to #127! Thanks for taking the <br/>
time to honor these early letterboxing "super-planters" along with <br/>
us. (As you can see, it's not always the folks you "shout the <br/>
loudest" who have done the lion's share of the groundwork in <br/>
developing our fine hobby!) We are just thrilled that so many people <br/>
have become such wonderful and prolific planters in more recent <br/>
times, too, and hope to be honoring them with "lil' Oscars" in the <br/>
years to come! Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete of RI<br/>
P185 F12456 X1331  (still hoping to get a chance to catch up on some <br/>
other trip reports soon, too, but they'll probably have to wait on <br/>
the back burner for a couple of weeks yet! Meanwhile,Happy <br/>
Halloween, and hope you have fun with those "Dancing Men"!)<br/>
