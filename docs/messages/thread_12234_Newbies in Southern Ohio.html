beautiful day!) and I think we're hooked!  We found the Pike Co. box, <br/>
2 in Scioto Trails S.P., 2 at OU-Chillicothe, and a couple in <br/>
Yoctangee Park.  Not bad for a first effort although there were 3 in <br/>
Yoctangee we couldn't find - Hin Mallet, Bearfoot in the Park, and <br/>
Yoctangee Baden.  The park was really crowded and we didn't want to <br/>
be too obvious.  We'll gettem' next time!  We're already planning to <br/>
plant some boxes of our own so watch this spot!  Thanks to you <br/>
creative types out there who carve some really great stamps and put <br/>
them out there for us to share.<br/>
