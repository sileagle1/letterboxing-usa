<br/>
If there is going to be anyone in the Shenandoah Valley of VA this <br/>
weekend I would like to recommend your attendance at the <br/>
Shenandoah Vineyards Annual Harvest Festival.<br/>
<br/>
There is going to be wine tastings, local crafts, kids events, a <br/>
BMW car show, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Most important, to ME at least, there I will premier the *FIRST in <br/>
a series* of a new series of LetterBoxes that I am currently <br/>
working on.<br/>
<br/>
I have teamed up with a few of the local vineyards in the release <br/>
of what I call the "Virginia Wine Trail LetterBoxes".<br/>
<br/>
It is a unique mixture of the outdoors, treasure hunting, and <br/>
great local wines.<br/>
<br/>
I will not actually *post* the clues until Saturday, sometime <br/>
around 1-2 pm, HOWEVER if you are at the Harvest Festival you will <br/>
not be able to miss the box. If you would like more details feel <br/>
free to contact me.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. All of these boxes will not only win you a stamp <br/>
representative of the individual vineyard, but also two others:<br/>
<br/>
a. A Vineyard Specific *First Finder* certificate<br/>
b. If you collect all of the stamps in the series, you are then <br/>
elidgable to receive a commemorative poster of the series.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting and Tasting!<br/>
