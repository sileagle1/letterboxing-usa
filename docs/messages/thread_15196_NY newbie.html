                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am one of those people who read Family Fun magazine and found out about <br/>
letterboxing. I'm so excited to get started. Already bought the Valley Quest book <br/>
and will be doing those over Labor Day when I head to NH. I live about 30 <br/>
minutes north of Albany, New York. Anyone know of any letterboxes in Albany or <br/>
the Adirondacks that have been checked recently. I saw some in the archives <br/>
dated 2001 and wasn't sure if there were still around. As soon as I get a few <br/>
finds under my belt I plan to start planting!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.<br/>
