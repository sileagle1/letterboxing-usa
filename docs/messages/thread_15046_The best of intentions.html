I think a quote from Mel Brooks is appropriate here...<br/>

Do me a favor.  If you lost your favorite uncle in a tragic sewer <br/>
accident, send the flames directly to my mailbox.  There is too much <br/>
hate mail on this site already.<br/>

While I'm a newbie and do not presume to speak for all, and cannot<br/>
appreciate every viewpoint out there, I think what you did with the<br/>
new Database is great.  The fact that a new *ahem* discussion has<br/>
started, has nothing to do with you personally, and I think it is<br/>
clear that your intentions are honorable. So from this corner, you get<br/>
my whole hearted applause for all the thought, effort, time and<br/>
reasons that you put into it. <br/>
