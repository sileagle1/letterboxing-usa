cscm and I are zipping around Delaware this week and are having a mediocre <br/>
success rate. Here's what we have so far...<br/>
<br/>
20030520:<br/>
<br/>
Serendipity's Sister: not found.  While the structures still appear to be <br/>
abandoned, or at least in ill repair, the "overgrown field" has been neatly <br/>
trimmed and the vegetation around the "sister" in question has been cleared.  No <br/>
box in sight.<br/>
<br/>
20030521:<br/>
<br/>
Assawoman Wildlife Management Area: Ducky at Assawoman: in place, intact, and <br/>
dry.<br/>
<br/>
Assawoman Wildlife Management Area: Assawoman Tower:  in place, intact, and <br/>
dry.  The log is almost full.<br/>
<br/>
Fenwick Island: in place, intact, and dry.<br/>
<br/>
The Owl &amp; The Pussycat: not found.  The area is apparently used as an outdoor <br/>
classroom.  The place where the box should have been looks like it was gone <br/>
over with a fine toothed comb, and there are little survey flags all over the <br/>
place.  Rustypuff thinks that students may have been doing soil testing and <br/>
plant inventories as followup to a fire that swept the area a few years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Gordon's Pond: not found.  We'd like to note that 232 paces is too many to be <br/>
consistantly useful.  Everyone's stride is different, and the higher the <br/>
number, the farther off a hunter may find him/herself.  Nevertheless, we're pretty <br/>
sure we found the correct root ball.  We searched a number of others, as <br/>
well, but to no avail.<br/>
<br/>
Sound of Sirens: in place, intact, and dry.<br/>
<br/>
20030522:<br/>
<br/>
Cape Henlopen Tower: in place, intact, and dry.  The instructions explicitely <br/>
say to "follow these [railroad] tracks."  No.  If you follow the tracks, your <br/>
search will be fruitless.  Better you should take the prescribed number of <br/>
steps *past* the railroad tracks.<br/>
<br/>
Cape Henlopen: not found.  Much of the Point is closed off to protect nesting <br/>
birds.  Our limited search did not turn up any evidence of "buried metal."  <br/>
Should we have brought a metal detector? There is, however a number of piled up <br/>
pvc poles that look like they were in place before they put up all the snow <br/>
fencing.<br/>
<br/>
Cape Henlopen Devil: in place, intact, and dry.  A very cool stamp.<br/>
<br/>
That's it so far.  We head up to New York tomorrow, and I suspect we will not <br/>
have time to get any more Delaware boxes.<br/>
