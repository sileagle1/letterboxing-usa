I'm assuming you're trying to put them up on Yahoo Groups? Each group<br/>
allows a maximum of 30 megabytes, I think it is, for their photos and<br/>
files. The only way to make room for more is to take some existing<br/>
photos off (or at least shrink them so they don't take up so much space).<br/>

Yep, it's the quota for the board, not individuals. The only way<br/>
around it is to find someone who can take off old or unnecessary<br/>
photos, or at least shrink the size of larger ones.<br/>
<br/>
If you have your own website, it might be easier to post them there<br/>
and just provide a link for everyone else to use. That'll get your<br/>
around the Yahoo Groups limitiation.  You could also try<br/>
http://photos.yahoo.com if you'd rather not make up your own website.<br/>

I'll also mention this to czeltic girl as she had taken on the dauting <br/>
task of resizing many of the photos already found in that section. We <br/>
had a moderator-type discussion of how to free up some space and we <br/>
decided that removing all the photos might not be our best move as some <br/>
*might* contain clues, etc. <br/>

Also -- if everyone else can review the photos section and consider <br/>
removing any old/out dated prints that you have posted, that would help <br/>
too!<br/>

&gt; them, and have enough room for about 15 more once you re-size them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll also mention this to czeltic girl as she had taken on the <br/>
dauting <br/>
&gt; task of resizing many of the photos already found in that section. <br/>
We <br/>
&gt; had a moderator-type discussion of how to free up some space and <br/>
we <br/>
&gt; decided that removing all the photos might not be our best move as <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; *might* contain clues, etc. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also -- if everyone else can review the photos section and <br/>
consider <br/>
&gt; removing any old/out dated prints that you have posted, that would <br/>
help <br/>
&gt; too!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I'm trying to upload some pics of our Mid-MO Spring LB Gathering <br/>
&gt; &gt; yesterday, but it keeps telling me I'm over my quota.  I've <br/>
never put <br/>
&gt; &gt; pics up before, so I'm confused.  Any suggestions?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks.<br/>

Yep, it's the quota for the board, not individuals. The only way<br/>
around it is to find someone who can take off old or unnecessary<br/>
photos, or at least shrink the size of larger ones.<br/>
<br/>
If you have your own website, it might be easier to post them there<br/>
and just provide a link for everyone else to use. That'll get your<br/>
around the Yahoo Groups limitiation.  You could also try<br/>
http://photos.yahoo.com if you'd rather not make up your own website.<br/>
