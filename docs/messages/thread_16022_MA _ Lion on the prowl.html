A suspected mountain lion on the prowl since July is sending tremors <br/>
through the North Shore, where police warn residents to keep children <br/>
and pets out of the woods, especially after dark.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
``It's at the killing stage,'' said Beverly animal control officer <br/>
Jim Lindley of what officials believe is an elusive mountain lion <br/>
that attacked and ravaged a young deer in the well-to-do Prides <br/>
Crossing neighborhood Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
``All indications are it's a large predator, most likely a cat,'' he <br/>
said. ``Be very, very leery of letting children play in wooded <br/>
areas.''<br/>
<br/>
Police thought the animal sighted more than 30 times in Manchester <br/>
and Beverly this summer was just a bobcat - until a woman and her <br/>
dogs stumbled upon a deer carcass.<br/>
<br/>
``There were bite marks to the skull. The animal ate out the <br/>
intestines, the throat and the face,'' police Sgt. Larry Van Liere <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
Authorities believe the deer was ambushed in a Paine Avenue backyard <br/>
while eating acorns Tuesday night.<br/>
<br/>
``The animal pounced on (the deer) five feet from her house and must <br/>
have dragged it 200 feet into the woods,'' Lindley said.<br/>
<br/>
Wildlife officials are testing the deer to figure out what kind of <br/>
animal killed it.<br/>
<br/>
Police suspect the lion is a discarded pet.<br/>
<br/>
``One hundred years ago they were hunted into extinction in this <br/>
area. We don't think it's a wild one,'' Lindley said. ``We think it <br/>
was a captive and all of a sudden it wasn't cute to them anymore.''<br/>

Just to add to this, I went on my "care and feeding" maintenance this <br/>
week for all my boxes, and was told by one of the members of the <br/>
organization on which "Hunter's Falls" is located that a pack of <br/>
coyotes are on the land and have actively tracked some members.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in reading the logbook, folks have expressed some trepidation <br/>
on doing this box.  The Board of Directors knows that this box is on <br/>
their land, all those "Members Only - Do Not Trespass" signs are for <br/>
the folks who would show up to use the land as it is intended, NOT <br/>
for the casual hiker.  Casual hikers are permitted specifically on <br/>
the section of land where this box is found.  But October to <br/>
February, blaze orange is still a fashion MUST.<br/>
