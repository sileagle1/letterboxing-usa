<br/>
A non-letterboxer gave me these stamps for Christmas, so I <br/>
decided to put them right to use to establish a series in honor of <br/>
my one-year anniversary of letterboxing! Please excuse the <br/>
store-boughtness. Planted 1/1/03 by Bluebird.<br/>
<br/>
Begin the walk in the same location as the Hammonasset River <br/>
box (listed under Killingworth, but it is in Madison). Park at the <br/>
trail opening at the intersection of Green Hill Road and Fawn <br/>
Brook Circle just before the bridge and Killingworth border.<br/>
<br/>
The Paper Mill site is included in the National Register of <br/>
Historic Places. It was built around 1865 to produce straw board. <br/>
You will see remains of a stone dam on the Killingworth side <br/>
and remains of the mill on the Madison side.<br/>
<br/>
This moderate 5-box series will take 1-1 1/2 hours for about a <br/>
2-mile+ counterclockwise loop. <br/>
<br/>
Generally, you will follow the Madison Land Conservation Trust's <br/>
blue trail counterclockwise. Avoid spurs and side trails such as <br/>
the ones to Hammonasset Meadows and Wickford. The trail you <br/>
want is #10, Main Trail (says "Loop" along second half where <br/>
you stay on right leg of it) and has the freshest blue markings, <br/>
when in doubt.<br/>
<br/>
#1<br/>
This is a geocache/letterbox hybrid. If you are not familiar with <br/>
geocaching, check out www.geocaching.com. Basically, you can <br/>
take an object/leave an object. The letterbox is inside and should <br/>
be returned there. Please don't take any travelbugs (geocachers' <br/>
hitchhikers) unless you will be visiting more caches so you can <br/>
let them continue on their way.<br/>
Start down the blue and almost immediately see a large tree on <br/>
your left. Go 100 degrees for 13 steps. The box will be just below <br/>
your feet. Please re-hide it carefully, as people fish nearby!<br/>
<br/>
Say "hello" to the Hammonasset River Letterbox as you pass by <br/>
the rock wall on your left (or visit if you haven't).<br/>
<br/>
#2<br/>
Find the 6-armed tree on your left. Walk uphill 200 degrees for 30 <br/>
steps to a tree hole.<br/>
<br/>
#3<br/>
Look for a 7-armed one this time. Take 40 steps at 100 degrees <br/>
to 5 arms (1/2 way there cross a spur but don't take it).<br/>
<br/>
#4 <br/>
Look for triple-arms on your left. Go 30 steps 200 degrees to a <br/>
hollow fallen log.<br/>
<br/>
#5<br/>
When you hear a hum ahead, look for a split rock 6 steps left of <br/>
the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Blue takes you to a road by the hum; continue on blue back to <br/>
Green Hill Road, with a short trip left back to your car.<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year!<br/>
