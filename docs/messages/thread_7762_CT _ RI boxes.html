                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fort Adams was in good shape a few weeks ago.  The relatively new <br/>
letterbox at Pt Judith is also in good shape.  Two of the three boxes <br/>
(#1 and 2) of Fast Track to Your Degree were in good shape this past <br/>
weekend.  In addition, there are a number of boxes on The East Bay <br/>
Bike Path (from Providence to Bristol, R.I.) that can quite easily be <br/>
reached by walking from the appropriate parking lot.  If you venture <br/>
into Southeastern MA, you could look up Trees (in Fall River) or <br/>
either of the Seaside Series (I and II) in Marion, Mattapoisett and <br/>
Fairhaven.  None require a lot of walking.  Have fun!<br/>
