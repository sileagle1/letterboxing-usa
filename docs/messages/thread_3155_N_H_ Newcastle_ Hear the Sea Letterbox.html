<div>Planted by the Leader of the Pack and Cowboy on 
a  History of America vacation.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Newcastle  is a little ship- history  
town of Colonial times nestled into the side of the city of Portsmouth. Go along 
the shore follow signs for the Coast Gaurd base. Hear the Sea is located at the 
historic site of Fort Constitution formerly Fort William and Mary. This fort has 
served the American  people from  pre-revolution through the French 
and Indian War, War of 1812, and the World Wars and into a New Millenium as it 
sits beside a Coast Gaurd Base reminder of all the  conflicts where 
Americans have drawn their defenses and rallied to  defend the 
nation.  Read about the building where sea mines were stored in WWII or how 
Paul Revere road to Portsmouth to warn the locals that the Brittish had 100 
barrels of gunpowder in the fort - barely protected . Nearly 300  locals 
rallied and stripped the fort of its precious store preserving it for use in 
battles to make America! </div>
<div>The fort has colonial buildings . 1812 era 
buildings and granite works, and a WWII lookout tower. A most incredible living 
timeline! Now history lesson in hand follow these diections to hear the 
sea:  Spiked gate -  sign of four - grassy hill- stars and stripes- 
walk toward granite. Cannons left -space-  steps down -sit. Here while 
looking at Pepperill  Cove, Maine ,camoflage your activity with cameras or 
snacks . Next to where you sit under rocks is your shell to help you " Hear 
the Sea" . Please rehide well and be sure a rock stays wedged in the gap to 
keep the winter sea out. </div></body></html>
