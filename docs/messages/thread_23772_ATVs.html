The folks in that region that get them never seem to have any land of their own to drive them on. Ditto with the snowmobiles, here in Ohio we are lucky to have 5 inches of snow on the ground max, no place for them here yet kids still annoy folks by driving through yards parallel to the highway. <br/>
