<div>Hello! Happy 4th!!! Had a great day letterboxing 
today! Unfortunately, a piece of the puzzle has been destroyed. According to the 
clue the box was hidden against outhouse. Apparently, a large tree had fallen 
and destroyed the outhouse. The workers who cleaned up the wreckage must 
have  found the box because we finally found it just thrown up on the stone 
wall. We re-hid the box behind a  stone in the stone wall, lined directly 
with the left side of the outhouse foundation. (The foundation is 
all that is left to the out-house). I hope that is alright with Leader of the 
Pack who originally hid box.  </div>

Hi all the box at the school was rescued by a worker who recognized <br/>
it  and knew who I was . She sent it home to me and I will be <br/>
replacing it soon. The cleanup crew has  removed the tree debris and <br/>
the old school outhouse. Insurance folks were out to see about <br/>
replacing it as this is a tiny muesam owned by Coventry Historical <br/>
Society. Thanks for tending to my boxin its "Hour of Need". The brick <br/>
School will be available next week.   Leader of the Pack<br/>
