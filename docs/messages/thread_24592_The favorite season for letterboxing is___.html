<br/>
My poll I just ran last week on my blog asked "Which Season do you do <br/>
MOST of your boxing or caching in?" and 68% of you preferred fall as <br/>
the time that you like to letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
I was a little surprised as I get a lot of activity during the summer, <br/>
however most of that activity is comming from newbies with a lot of <br/>
storebought stamps and finger prints During the fall I noticed that the <br/>
numbers are not as high, but the quality of stamps better and there are <br/>
more homemade stamps during the fall. I think that is when the serious <br/>
lb's do their work<br/>
