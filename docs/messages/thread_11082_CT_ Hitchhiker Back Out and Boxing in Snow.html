some success despite the snow. We planted and found some; <br/>
some had to be pried out with a whammy bar! That wet snow <br/>
really slowed us down.<br/>
<br/>
While we out on Saturday we re-released Bruce and Aili's <br/>
"Remembrance" hitchhiker which I had appropiately found in 911 <br/>
in Westport, CT. (the first time I went there we were on high alert <br/>
and a guard had his eye on me so I decided not to seach around <br/>
in the rocks at that particular moment). <br/>
