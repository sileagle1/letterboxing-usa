<br/>
On a recent trip through Cape Cod, the Rosettes and I did a bit of<br/>
letterboxing, including stopping by a hitchhiker hostel. As I often do<br/>
when I pick up a hitchhiker, I simply put it in my bag without looking<br/>
closely at it or stamping in right away, in the interest of discretion.<br/>
<br/>
Later, when I sat down at home to finish the job, I found that the<br/>
hitchiker bag had the wrong stamp in it. I suspect someone had gone<br/>
through the hostel, looking at each stamp, and were not careful putting<br/>
them back.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to try to contact the owner of the hitchhiker and maybe the<br/>
hostel owner, and perhaps we can reunite stamps and logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
Any other sugestions?<br/>

Someone just contacted me today to tell me that the stamp was missing <br/>
from my HH Hostel.  Please contact me off-list so we can arrange to <br/>
swap stamps back.. Please include the name of the HH that you have so <br/>
I can look for the stamp in the Hostel.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
