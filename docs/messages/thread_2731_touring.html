    I am going on a trip to Manassas, VA with my family. I'm 11 years<br/>
old. We'll be driving daily to Washington D.C. to do some touring. We'll<br/>
be staying with my aunt, uncle, and my cousins in their house in<br/>
Manassas. I am not sure how long we will be staying, but around three<br/>
days. I would like to try to find some letterboxes on my trip as there<br/>
aren't any nearby my hometown. It might help if I told you I lived in<br/>
Camden County. Would there be any specific letterboxes you would<br/>
recomend or any tips for finding them?<br/>

Hi Liz,<br/>
<br/>
There are a bunch of letterboxes close to Manassas that are fun to <br/>
hunt.  You can hunt for the Accotink letterbox and the Aya - the fern <br/>
at Fort Belvoir.  There is a nice town park near Quantico Marine Base <br/>
called Locust Shade that has two fun boxes.  Leesylvania State Park <br/>
is pretty close to Manassas and there are at least 5 there.  You can <br/>
find the clues for all of those on the letterboxing.org website and <br/>
also check out the Washington DC metro boxes, because I believe there <br/>
are a few right in Washington DC which you might be able to find as <br/>
you tour around the City.  Have fun and let us know how you make out.<br/>

<div>Liz....  Just about all 
of the boxes in Northern VA are accessable.  Coming or going to the city 
try the boxes (2) on Roosevelt Island, or take a drive south on the Georage 
Washngton / Mount Vernon Parkway. There are a couple along there too.  You 
can't go wrong with any of them...</div>

Already mentioned, but I'll say it again:<br/>
The Mount Vernon Trail series. Especially "Runway" near the airport.<br/>
Leesylvania State park <br/>

There should be more than enough letterboxing in DC for your vacation!<br/>

I am going to save your list and next trip to Maryland I'm going solo so I <br/>
can do all the boxing I want!!!( Which will be every day all day (LOL)!!! )<br/>
As I promised before I will plant two boxes on my 'boxing jaunt when I come.<br/>
The area is just full of possiblities and wonderful boxes await those who <br/>
wander that way.<br/>
I have been to Haines Point and it is wonderful!! I even have a picture of <br/>
my son less than a year old in his baby stroller at the base of a huge body <br/>
part!!! Lockmaster is an 11yr. old now !! Time does fly..<br/>
Thanks for your great input even tho I know it was meant for "touring"<br/>
Box On!!!<br/>

If you haven't already come to DC to look for letterboxes you might try the <br/>
ones at Huntley Meadows and my favorite one is "Hal and the Magic Mushroom" I <br/>
don't believe anyone has found it yet and I bet you could. You just need put <br/>
on your thinking cap a bit to figure out where it starts and from there it is <br/>
easy.<br/>
<br/>
At Brookside Gardens in Wheaton Maryland there is a Butterfly house with <br/>
fantastic butterflies flying all about. They will be there until Sept. It <br/>
would be a great place to visit. And there just happens to be a couple more <br/>
letter boxes in Wheaton Regional Park right next to it, like you can walk <br/>
from one to the other.  I think you and your parents would enjoy the Gardens <br/>
and the butterflys and of course the letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
And don't forget the fun of hiding a box yourself and thinking up clues. You <br/>
can just use a stamp that you bought, you don't need to make one. I would <br/>
love to find one that you hid.<br/>
<br/>
May you have lots of nuts in your life,<br/>
