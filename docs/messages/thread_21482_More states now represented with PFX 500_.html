Wow - 3 wonderful days in a row of terrific local cross-country <br/>
skiing (even with my strapped up ankle!), and now how exciting to <br/>
stop by the Cross-Mills library and find several more entries to add <br/>
to the PFX 500 club! Letterboxing certainly is growing nicely all <br/>
across the nation - we now have reports of PFX 500 from "Maiden" <br/>
(Melanie) from the boxious state of Oregon, "Schizokeet" (Becky) from <br/>
lovely Virginia, and "Silver Eagle" from the great big state of <br/>
Texas! We've been finding Silver Eagle's boxes spread out all over <br/>
the country lately, so he definitely gets around, but now it looks <br/>
like Texas has become quite a "letterbox draw" in itself, so we'll <br/>
have to try to get out there ourselves one of these days, even if not <br/>
in time for that Texas Rodeo Gathering that "Silver Eagle" is <br/>
planning to have in just a couple of weeks!<br/>
<br/>
And then, of course, let's not forget about Silent Doug from PA! He <br/>
may be living in CT now and pushing PFX 1000, but he certainly has <br/>
letterboxed in many different places, and actually reached PFX 500 <br/>
back in August while still living in PA, so we're very happy to have <br/>
him as our first representative from that friendly state! <br/>
<br/>
Then from CT we have new members "Donutz716" (Donna), who says she <br/>
was glad to get a big boost from the Monster Mash, as well as another <br/>
fine couple, Carolyn &amp; Bob, who call themselves "Voyageur", and think <br/>
they took a long time to reach PFX 500, but really didn't! After all, <br/>
no matter which way you look at it, it still takes a tremendous <br/>
amount of effort and determination to reach that goal, so I really <br/>
think that NO ONE could possibly be so mean, insecure or controlling <br/>
as to belittle these wonderful people's accomplishments, or try to <br/>
make them feel bad about their counts in any way! <br/>
<br/>
Actually, we've met almost every single person on the PFX club <br/>
list,and I'd have to say that they are just about the finest group of <br/>
people you could ever hope to find anywhere! Many of them are fairly <br/>
quiet and unassuming, and some rarely if ever post to talk lists, but <br/>
all of them have given so much of themselves in various ways to this <br/>
amazing little hobby of ours, whether it be through spreading <br/>
enthusiasm, offering encouragement, planting, carving, or whatever! <br/>
NO ONE knows just how much these people have contributed to the <br/>
overall growth of letterboxing in this country, and it would be a <br/>
real shame if jealousy, pettiness, or intense personal hatred were <br/>
allowed to bully the many inspired and inspiring people coming along <br/>
in this hobby into being afraid to "stand up and be counted"!<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, most people can easily see through thin disguises and <br/>
realize that PFX-ness is not the real problem even for just a few. <br/>
It's actually a very good sign that NO ONE fell into the trap of <br/>
faulty thinking that giving a little bit of recognition to people who <br/>
had worked hard to deserve it was some sort of "contest"! Thanks and <br/>
kudos to everyone who saw that through!<br/>
<br/>
Mostly I'm just grateful that there are so many kind and gracious <br/>
people in letterboxing, knowing that NO COUNT OLAF, hiding behind <br/>
whatever various nefarious dark disguises, could ruin this wonderful <br/>
hobby. For me, like the Baudelaire orphans, it's just "no contest". <br/>
Perhaps someday I'll explain why. Meanwhile, I'll just keep trying to <br/>
wear rosy glasses, stick to the "high road" and hope that many other <br/>
folks will, too! <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

(and as Lemony Snicket might say, STOP right here if you do not wish <br/>
to run the risk of reading something that may be very disturbing to <br/>
you. I suggest that you turn off your computer immediately, or you <br/>
may be forced to find out that several days back when I wrote my <br/>
first message after a very long time, I must have still been in the <br/>
throes of a delirious fever, because I made the mistake of typing in <br/>
F6500 instead of F6650, thereby shortchanging myself of one hundred <br/>
fifty letterboxes!  And now in the meantime I have skiied out to find <br/>
and plant another box in the snow, replace one that was in for <br/>
repairs, and surprise a hitcher in another box while doing box check, <br/>
so my total is at present P109 F6652 X 781. I wish I could have <br/>
spared you the misfortune of having to eyeball these wretched, <br/>
boring, grotesque, miserable numbers, but then I really did try to <br/>
warn you!!! :-)  ( So much for my Lemony Snicket imitation! I'm <br/>
sorry, I really don't mean to offend anyone, but, as Ryan so aptly <br/>
said, I just really DO like having so many things TO count! Hope at <br/>
least some of you can share my excitement about how this hobby is <br/>
growing all across the country by leaps and bounds!)<br/>

So what you are saying is that those 150 letterboxes meant nothing <br/>
to you except as a number you could add to your tally? A simple typo <br/>
would have erased the enjoyment you had finding these 150 boxes? I'm <br/>
glad that none of my boxes are considered to be of such in-<br/>
