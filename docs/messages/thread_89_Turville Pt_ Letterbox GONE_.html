<br/>
Well, I suppose this was bound to happen.  I'm just sorry it<br/>
happened to you Deborah.  Can I ask if the box was concealed?<br/>
Mine are not visible to passers-by - the clues are needed<br/>
to find them.  I'm just wondering if this was done by someone<br/>
who had gotten the clues and then went out of their way to<br/>
get it or if it is more likely that it was taken by someone<br/>
who stumbled across it?<br/>
<br/>
Did you have 2 stamps as indicated on your clues page?  Can you <br/>
use the other stamp then?  I'm just wondering.<br/>

<br/>
The box was not visible from the main trail, nor was it visible with<br/>
just a brief look at the surroundings from the lookout point it was<br/>
just behind ~ however, I could not say that it was concealed. It<br/>
would have been seen if a person decided to take a close look inside<br/>
the tree and bent down and to the right to look inside. <br/>
  I obviously underestimated general curiosity here, and<br/>
also the park is used in general much more than I thought. <br/>
When I scouted the park and placed the box it was on a weekday ~<br/>
quite deserted ~ and when we returned on weekends I was surprised<br/>
to see so many people on the trails. I think it was found accidentally.<br/>
 My first inclination was that an accidental find would be a fine thing <br/>
(witness the first postcard I received from a person who came across it <br/>
without clues), but now I'm determined not to be so trusting.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Did you have 2 stamps as indicated on your clues page? <br/>
<br/>
  There were two stamps in the box, the main image and a little<br/>
one of words, and they were the original eraser carvings. <br/>
I do have a good copy of the images, and I will have them made<br/>
up in rubber this winter, I guess. If you would be so kind, Dan,<br/>
the clues for this letterbox should be deleted, or maybe a line or two<br/>
replacing the clues explaining that they will be revised in the spring...<br/>
Though the spot was really idyllic, I will have to find a more <br/>
concealed hiding place. <br/>
Thanks much,<br/>
Deborah <br/>

This is VERY SAD !!!!!<br/>
Like Dan, I am also curious about the location and visibility of the box.  I'm<br/>
also wondering if there was any literature inside explaining the nature of the<br/>
hobby.  I am hopeful that the info sheet that Erik Davis and I created might<br/>
encourage some accidental discoverers to gain an understanding and respect for<br/>
the hobby, thus becoming potential letterboxers themselves, rather than<br/>
thieves and vandals.  (This info sheet is referenced, and available to all, in<br/>
the "Gettting Started" section of the Letterbox USA website)  Personally, I<br/>
have been placing 20-30 copies of this sheet in each of my boxes, so people<br/>
can feel free to take one for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to be discouraged, Deborah.  I know there will doubtless be other<br/>
boxes that come up missing, and I'm sorry yours had to be the first.  But<br/>
please turn the other cheek and replace the box.  Hide it well and enclose the<br/>
above mentioned info sheet.  I have faith that such disappearances will be the<br/>
exception, not the rule.<br/>
<br/>

I was also sorry to hear of the first letterbox lost - that is, I assume<br/>
it was the first, as I've not been able to check on most of mine.<br/>
<br/>
Please fill us in on how well it was hidden!<br/>
<br/>
 If it was casually found by a non-letterboxer, as a result of too<br/>
easily seen, thats the best news, because it is one that we can likley<br/>
protect against (.e. hide it better next time. And, include an appeal to<br/>
the casual finder to PLEASE put it back. And thats the best that we can<br/>
hope to do.<br/>
<br/>
There is always the possibility that it was found by an "authority<br/>
figure", meaning, in an unacceptable place. If so, you'd likel;y hear<br/>
about it, hopefully easily dealt with.<br/>
<br/>
Worst scenario: Somebody monitering these websites went looking with<br/>
malice aforethought. Poses a tough question, likely only able to be<br/>
dealth with philosophically: Don't look back, make another and continue<br/>
to spread the fun for others. Nobody can really steal what you are<br/>
willing to give away, although it is still frustrating when it happens. <br/>
<br/>
I suppose also, if there are a series of missing boxes, one can always<br/>
decide to release clues only on request, say, via an e-mail request.<br/>
Personally, I'd hate to see it come to that, as would all of us. But, it<br/>
is my understanding that many Dartmoor clues are passed about among<br/>
friends and not generally published. Still, at this early stage here,<br/>
I'll still prefer to take the risk of loss to keep the hobby easily<br/>
accessible to as many as possible. Lets all hope that it works out that<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, Deborah<br/>

This convinces me Deborah that your box was stumbled upon by someone<br/>
who doesn't know what letterboxing is.  That's good news (better news<br/>
anyway) than if it had been hunted by someone starting out at the clues page.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; What do you all think? This<br/>
&gt; isn't alpine terrain or anything.... think it's OK to direct a searcher<br/>
&gt; off a trail a tiny bit?<br/>
<br/>
I would actually imagine the majority of letterboxes to be off trail<br/>
at some point, in some cases substantially off trail.  I would speculate<br/>
that many, if not most, in Dartmoor are (perhaps someone could confirm/deny<br/>
this).<br/>
<br/>
The one I placed in Valley Forge park is off trail, and someone still found<br/>
it accidently (and left a nice note and otherwise left it alone).  I have<br/>
put in my clue that off trail hiking is required, so people not confortable <br/>
with that could pass if they want, so I guess IMO off trail is ok.<br/>

The letterbox I have in Sewanee is off trail just a bit.  I guess I need to<br/>
get back up the mountain and see if it is still there!  It is about 40 miles<br/>
from Chattanooga, I'll be up there this weekend, so I will check on it.  Keep<br/>

&gt; I think the main trouble is trying to hide a box without getting<br/>
&gt;  off-trail. Kind of thinking now I may have to get off a few paces in <br/>
&gt;  order to hide something thoroughly. What do you all think? This <br/>
&gt;  isn't alpine terrain or anything.... think it's OK to direct a searcher<br/>
&gt;  off a trail a tiny bit?<br/>
<br/>
As others have said, just use some judgement and common sense.  My waterfall<br/>
series is in forested area that belongs to Uncle Sam.  I was EXTREMELY careful<br/>
not to require anyone to tread on any mosses, ferns, or loose (inclined)<br/>
gravel.  If you make a visible mark on the land by stepping there, you<br/>
shouldn't be stepping there... that's my motto.<br/>
<br/>
Still, a couple of the waterfall boxes are off trail a bit... one requires<br/>
walking across some large stones that won't be easily displaced... another is<br/>
in a grassy area where a minor side path had already been established.  Above<br/>
all else, always respect the land on which you're walking.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, my rules might not be so strict in some place like a playground or<br/>
a local camping area as they are in a State or Federal nature preserve.  Some<br/>
public land has been designated as being for general roaming and playing.<br/>
Other areas are to remain pristine, in which case you should never encourage<br/>
anyone to take ONE STEP off the established trails.<br/>
<br/>
If any of my boxes should be brought to the attention of park authorities, I<br/>
am confident that the care that has been put into choosing my locations will<br/>
be a factor in their tolerance for my activities.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I also try to find locations that are a bit out of the way, as<br/>
well.  Maybe along a seldom used side trail, or near a natural resting spot...<br/>
someplace where I won't seem too conspicuous when I sit down and perform my<br/>
stamping-in ritual.  Finding the perfect spot can be a challenge, but it's<br/>
worth the extra effort.  My goal is to do my best to keep the hobby in-synch<br/>
with nature and out of the public eye.<br/>
<br/>
My understanding of the Dartmoor situation is that boxes are not neccessarily<br/>
located on a distinct trail, but the rule applies that you should not disturb<br/>
the natural vegetation or rock formations in any way.  Also, never interfere<br/>
with the habitat of any wildlife, and stay clear of historical landmarks,<br/>
ruins, monuments, etc.<br/>

It occurs to me that the sorrow we have all expressed for Dehorah's recent<br/>
loss exemplifies something significant.  Something about ourselves.  And<br/>
something about our hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Something about the way we make this little stamp... put it in this little<br/>
box...<br/>
<br/>
Then... we set it free!  Exposed to the elements.  Exposed to society.<br/>
Vulnerable.<br/>
Fragile.<br/>
<br/>
The soft, delicate rubber... the crisp, dry paper.<br/>
Alone... in a world of rain drops and tear drops and the almighty unknown.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly I realize why so many of us got emotional several months ago when<br/>
someone mentioned the possibility of changing the hobby to discourage<br/>
inclusion of the stamp in the letterbox as a deterrent to theft.<br/>
<br/>
'Cyberboxing' as the idea came to be known, struck a sour note with those of<br/>
us who recognized that a REAL letterbox, with a carefully designed custom<br/>
stamp enclosed, has a personality... an aura... a life-force of its own.  To<br/>
lose a letterbox is to lose a little piece of life.  But a letterbox with no<br/>
stamp has never lived at all.<br/>

What a gerat sentiment! I most heartily agree.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in college, I was a cermaics studio groupie - made lots of<br/>
pots, loved the process, the glazes, the dynamics of form and creation,<br/>
kiln roaring heat, all of that.<br/>
<br/>
Once, I remember, a pot of mine broke in the kiln. Heartbreak. Oh well,<br/>
I said aloud, I can epoxy it together. No, said one wise old potter, let<br/>
go and make another. Pots are meant to be enjoyed in the lifetime they<br/>
have. If they break, thats part of their karma - just make another and<br/>
don't let it bother you - its the natural order of things.<br/>
<br/>
So to with Deborah's missing letterbox - the stamp is somewhere else<br/>
now, on another pathway. Hopefully, inspiring others, albeit in another<br/>
venue than that for which it was brought into being. <br/>
<br/>
The object is not what is precious - it is the process that is the art.<br/>
Enjoy the process, and the joy that it brings, to you and to others.<br/>
<br/>
