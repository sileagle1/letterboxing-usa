Evel Knievel Letterbox<br/>
Placed by A-Bear on 27 Feb 03.<br/>
Twin Falls, Idaho<br/>
Jerome County<br/>
<br/>
Level of Difficulty:  I think you might find this<br/>
difficult because you must rely heavily on your<br/>
compass as all the rocks look the same.  Less than a <br/>
mile trail.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Travelling on I84 , take exit 173 and<br/>
head south on State Highway 93.  About 2 miles south<br/>
of the interstate turn left/head east onto the Golf<br/>
Course Road.  There is a sign at the cattle guard<br/>
identifying this area as the Snake River Rim<br/>
Recreation Area.  From the cattle guard drive 2.5<br/>
miles where you can park.  This parking area is right<br/>
before the paved road ends and a dirt road descends<br/>
down to a private golf course. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  From the gravel parking lot, begin at the trio<br/>
power line poles.  Head south on the dirt road due<br/>
west of the poles.  Find your way to Karens boulder <br/>
way between trio and twin power line poles.  From the<br/>
dirt road on the south side of Karens rock walk 12<br/>
paces at 120 degrees to the edge of the dirt road. <br/>
Head off trail another 9 paces until you approach some<br/>
rocks about 10 feet ahead.  Across the canyon at 140<br/>
degrees looks like a restroom in a parking lot.  Walk<br/>
10 paces towards the building, but you are not that<br/>
close to the edge.  Stop!!  Align yourself at the spot<br/>
with the twin poles at 250 degrees, the lone pole at<br/>
180 degrees and at 100 degrees you need the three<br/>
white buildings on stilts down below.  Nestled under a<br/>
rock at this point is your Evel Knievel letterbox. <br/>
Behind you rests a cove of more rocks.  Enjoy the view<br/>
of the falls minus the crowds on this side of the<br/>
river.  <br/>
<br/>
Beware of rattlesnakes and wear gloves or use a stick<br/>
when reaching in dark places for this letterbox.  Also<br/>
keep an eye out for roaming cattle and their messy<br/>
surprises they leave behind. <br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; Hey Ryan-<br/>
&gt; Yah-you read my mind.  After I posted the clues, I realized I forgot<br/>
&gt; to mention anything about the significance of Evel Knievel and this <br/>
&gt; location.  Chalk it up to me being not too bright with making up <br/>
&gt; clues and trying to rush to find a hiding spot so I could drive <br/>
back <br/>
&gt; to Star before dark and leaving out the motivating factor behind <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; stamp in this location.=-) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In 1974 daredevil Evel Knievel attempted to leap across the Snake <br/>
&gt; River.  Somewhere a few miles southwest of this letterbox <br/>
supposedly <br/>
&gt; lies a dirt ramp he used to launch his rocket-powered vehicle.  I <br/>
got <br/>
&gt; that information from the AAA Tourbook on Idaho, Montana, and <br/>
&gt; Wyoming.  <br/>
&gt; Thanks for asking Ryan.  =-)<br/>
&gt; Aryn Alyssa (aka A-Bear)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PS On my way back from Twin Falls, I saw a bald eagle flying over <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; bridge where I hid The Star letterbox.  I was so excited.  All <br/>
those <br/>
&gt; months I kept trying to find a live bald eagle in Eagle, Idaho.  <br/>
They <br/>
&gt; were hiding in Star.  =-)  <br/>

I knew there had to be a reason behind the letterbox!  Thanks for the <br/>
info!<br/>

Wow!  At long last, congratulations!  Few other people on this board <br/>
probably know it, so I'll let them in on the story, that this woman <br/>
has been dieing to see a real, live bald eagle in the wild for I <br/>
don't know how many months.  I wouldn't be surprised if she was more <br/>
giddy about that than a kid at Christmas time!  =)  <br/>
<br/>
At last, you can finally rest in peace knowing you've spotted a bald <br/>
eagle!  =)<br/>

The worst part, however, is that when we would tell her of our own <br/>
real-life Bald Eagle encounters throughout the past several <br/>
months/years--she never believed us!!!  Now, she HAS to believe us!  <br/>
I have them flying over my backyard quite frequently!!!<br/>
