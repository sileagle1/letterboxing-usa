WHO LET THE DOGS OUT! LETTERBOXES<br/>
<br/>
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT!  I confess, it was me.  Skip, Rover, Fido and <br/>
Spot are leashless and loose in Portland, Oregon's magnificent Forest <br/>
Park in Multnomah County.  It's up to you to capture their images in <br/>
your letterboxing journal!  In a 26-mile area, Forest Park is the <br/>
largest city park in the USA and well worth checking out.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
------------------------------<br/>
DOGWOOD TRAILHEAD, FOREST PARK, PORTLAND, OREGON<br/>
Directions:  From the bustling street corner of NW 23rd and Lovejoy <br/>
in Portland's delightful Northwest Portland urban neighborhood drive <br/>
West on NW Lovejoy.  Lovejoy turns into NW Cornell Road.  You will go <br/>
through a couple tunnels on your way up.  You'll want to turn right <br/>
on NW 53rd Drive.  From here go up .9 mile.  Go beyond the big <br/>
parking and picnic area and not much farther up is the pullout on the <br/>
right where you may park for the Dogwood Trail.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Easy (these clues should take you right to each letterbox).<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  Easy to Moderate.  Probably counting stamping time this <br/>
trail takes somewhere between an hour to an hour and 1/2.  It also <br/>
depends on the speed of the participants (I'm pretty slow, myself).  <br/>
There is some uphill, but it's really not too strenuous and it's a <br/>
fun place for a nice hike. Please wear appropriate attire (especially <br/>
footwear) for mud!<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
------------------------------<br/>
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT LETTERBOX #1:  SKIP<br/>
Park at the pullout for the Dogwood and Wild Cherry Trails (No signs <br/>
from the road tell you this, though).  Just beyond the entrance there <br/>
are signs. Follow the sign for Dogwood Trail. Continue straight on <br/>
this path, past the large clearing on the left with the High Fire <br/>
Danger sign.  Keep going straight until you come to a very tall, long <br/>
skinny snag on your left-hand side.  It's eaten through the middle up <br/>
to about 10 or so feet and is just next to the trail. At this snag do <br/>
an about face, go seven steps and turn left.  You should be looking <br/>
at a raised four-foot tall stump, which Skip has claimed as his own <br/>
territory.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
------------------------------<br/>
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT LETTERBOX #2 ROVER<br/>
Continue on the Dogwood Trail till you come to the trailhead for the <br/>
Wildwood Trail.  Head right and wind on down the Wildwood.  Shortly <br/>
on down the way you'll go beneath an arch made by a thin, leaning <br/>
tree.  Just ahead and to your left is a nice low resting spot.  Have <br/>
a seat.  Take your right hand and point to the majestic Douglas Fir <br/>
in front of you.  Lower your left hand to the side of the log you're <br/>
sitting on and be careful that Rover doesn't bite you!<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
------------------------------<br/>
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT LETTERBOX #3:  FIDO<br/>
Continue on this Wildwood Trail.  Pass one culvert.  Pass the second <br/>
culvert and high five the blue diamond.  Keep going and there will be <br/>
a third and forth culvert you'll go over.  At the fifth culvert don't <br/>
grab the reinforcing stick to your left to throw for Fido.  Instead <br/>
from this point go 53 steps.  Now stand.  Fido should be rooting <br/>
around the single tree on your right.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
------------------------------<br/>
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT LETTERBOX #4:  SPOT<br/>
After your visit with Fido, keep on going until you reach the trail <br/>
junction.  At this major fork, go up the Dogwood Trail for a while.  <br/>
Go beyond a white witness post for a survey marker on your right and <br/>
keep going up the trail.  You may see the Fremont Bridge from here.  <br/>
Keep on going.  Where things flatten out a bit continue on around the <br/>
bends.  You may catch glimpses of downtown Portland to your left.  <br/>
Keep going a ways and be on the lookout for a tree with six trunks on <br/>
your left and a trunk of tree jutting slightly onto the trail.  From <br/>
here go 8 steps ahead.  To the right is a tree rearing its <br/>
"serpentine" head your way.  From here go forward approximately 33 or <br/>
so steps.  On the left-hand side Spot's back porch has a beautiful <br/>
view of the city through the trees on a clear winter day.<br/>
<br/>
Continue up the trail.  When you come to the next fork (the large <br/>
clearing is ahead of you), take a left back to your original starting <br/>
place at the Dogwood Trailhead.  Have a great time!!!<br/>
