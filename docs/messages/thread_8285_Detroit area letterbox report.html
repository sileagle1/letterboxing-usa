                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just finished a Detroit-area letterboxing spree -- here's a report:<br/>
<br/>
I found all five of edugaytor's boxes in Independence Oaks County Park: 49 <br/>
Habitat Trail; This Place Rocks; Independent Oak; Dragonflies Are Free; and <br/>
Ladies of the Lake. It's a beautiful park, and the day was blustery and <br/>
invigorating.<br/>
<br/>
The ziplocs protecting This Place Rocks have been chewed through by some <br/>
critter, though the box itself is okay -- the bags should probably be <br/>
replaced before winter. The Dragonflies Are Free's bag also seems to have <br/>
some holes in it, and the box itself has a cracked lid.<br/>
<br/>
I also found Snowflake, April Fools, and Mirkwood's new Crosswinds Marsh <br/>
and Bald Eagle. The April Fools box is one of the oldest that I've found, <br/>
placed in April 1999.<br/>
<br/>
The Snowflake box has been chewed on, though it's been rebagged so it may <br/>
be fine.<br/>
<br/>
Though I was able to find the garden this time, I wasn't able to find the <br/>
Secret Garden box in Royal Oak -- I believe it is missing.<br/>
<br/>
I think I've now covered just about all the boxes in the metro Detroit area <br/>
-- I must have drove past 15 or more county and MetroParks while getting to <br/>
all the above locations, so you Michigan letterboxers have plenty of <br/>
locations to place more boxes before my next trip to the area in a couple <br/>
of months! (Looking forward to the rest of your Crosswinds Marsh series, <br/>
Mirkwood!)<br/>

I have a box placed up in Presque Isle Harbor, between Alpena and Rogers City.  Checked on it last weekend, but, alas, no visitors yet!  Pretty soon it will be buried under snow....guess it will be a lone box until next spring.  <br/>

Deb, I'll have to make time to come and visit some of your boxes on the west coast of MI.<br/>

Detroit) and logged in to your Covered Bridge box in Lancaster County. I <br/>
was the second visitor, though I thought I had a good shot at being the <br/>
first. I didn't think there were that many letterboxers in South-Central <br/>
PA, since there are hardly any boxes there!  (Then again, I thought the <br/>

I also have one of those unusual stories to go along with the Covered <br/>
Bridge box. As I rounded the stone wall to go under the bridge, I saw that <br/>
there was a tent and 2 folding chairs and lots of camping gear on the grass <br/>
right under the bridge. The tent door was facing away from me; I stopped <br/>
dead in my tracks and thought for a minute. If someone was in the tent, <br/>
then I probably wouldn't be able to get the box. Finally, I called out <br/>
"hello?" a couple of times, and eased around to the front of the tent. The <br/>
flap was open, and there was no one inside, so I found the box, took it <br/>
around to the other side of the bridge and stamped in, then replaced it in <br/>
its hiding spot. I made sure it was tucked in so that it wouldn't be <br/>
noticed by whoever was camping there.<br/>
<br/>
There were no cars parked on the road anywhere near, and I didn't encounter <br/>
anyone on my way back to my car. It was kinda weird; but I realized that <br/>
the grassy plot directly under the bridge was completely hidden from the <br/>
road and from any of the homes or barns nearby. The only way to see it was <br/>
to be walking alongside the stream! And it *was* a nice camping spot....<br/>
