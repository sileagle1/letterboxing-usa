Southwestern Illinois. I was able to find 7 before a downpour ended my <br/>
boxing adventures:<br/>
<br/>
  * Watershed (Even though it's listed on the LBNA site as a <br/>
geocache/letterbox combination, it doesn't have a stamp, and I'm not sure <br/>
it ever did. It's currently a big mess with no journal and scraps of paper <br/>
stuffed in the box with logs jotted on them.)<br/>
  * Valley of Coal (The journal was a little damp, but I left a dessicant <br/>
packet in the bag and that might help dry it out some.)<br/>
  * Sitting Pretty Susie<br/>
  * PokeyMan #43 -- Oddish<br/>
  * PokeyMan #14 -- Kakuna (Needs some maintenance -- the outer ziplock bag <br/>
is torn, and it's in a very moist environment.)<br/>
  * Fishers of Men<br/>
  * CMPL (very nicely done, though some geocachers have evidently mistaken <br/>
this for a geocache -- there are some cache items in the box.)<br/>
<br/>
U Island was inaccessible today, and I couldn't find PokeyMan #50, but I <br/>
think it may have been removed for maintenance?<br/>
<br/>
For those who are keeping track, today's finds take me past 100, in 10 <br/>
different states:<br/>

                    <html><body>HI Silent DOug!    We love visitors .... otherwise we don't get many letterboxers in the area!!!   <br/>
  I know that watershed had a well marked stamp at one time but its not one of my boxes so I don't know about its current condition ... <br/>
  CMPL box is one of my favorite and I'm glad you enjoyed it!!  At our next visit I'll have to clean out the cache items ....I don't know why that keeps happening.  :o)<br/>
Sorry you missed out on the U Island box ... the location is closed on Mondays.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll check on the Kakuna box .... it usually needs lots of maintenance.  WE were expecting to see you at Slices of Quince today ...since that one is within our visual range but it must have started raining before you made it that far. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the updates ,<br/>
