"Feel Lucky?"<br/>
<br/>
Full title: First, I'd ask myself, "Do I feel Lucky?". Well, do ya punk? <br/>
<br/>
Part of my "Famous Movie Lines" series. This line was of course Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry. I think the stamp goes well with both the line and the park's neighbors :-)<br/>

State: Ohio <br/>
County: Franklin <br/>
City: Columbus<br/>
Difficulty: Very easy, less than 1/4 mile round trip (unless you go for Doll's Head Swamp too)<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Take State Rt. 315 to the Bethel Road exit. At the first traffic light, go right (north) onto Olentangy River Rd. Travel north on Olentangy River Rd. exactly 1/2 mile. On the right, at 5400 Olentangy River Rd., you will see a one-story stucco building housing the Columbus Police Northwest Substation. Turn right into their driveway (this is marked by a brown wooden sign that reads "Olentangy Nature Trail" next to the entrance). Park in the lot and walk along the edge of the parking lot to the back of the building. <br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
At the trail head, take the right hand trail entrance. Follow the grassy path. As you cross the culvert and go into the woods onto the dirt path, you'll see two large trees in front of you (on your right if you already made the bend in the path). The box is on the South side of the most Western of the two trees. Look under a small mossy rock. <br/>
<br/>
Please re-hide this so that it looks like the rock has lived there for awhile by covering it with twigs and leaves.<br/>
