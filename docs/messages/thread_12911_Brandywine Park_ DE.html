Followed the wonderful, fun and accurate clues, found the tree and the pile <br/>
of rocks and nothing under them. I ended up replacing the owners box with one <br/>
of my own because it's a shame to go through the trouble of finding THE PLACE <br/>
then not finding THE BOX --and, I happened to have an extra box set-up with <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Don't want to step on any toes. Wanted the owner to tell me it was OK that I <br/>
planted an impostor which I'm calling Brandywine Park Redeaux.<br/>
