than shopping!)  We headed out to find the Creature of Fountainhead <br/>
Park and were rewarded with all 5 boxes - yes Scooby is there! - and a <br/>
geocache!  Our first!  We then left our friends and headed into DC to <br/>
see some monuments and nabbed the Taft Memorial box in the pitch dark.  <br/>
It was in o.k. shape - a bit soggy.  The ink has run on the pages, but <br/>
you can still make everyone out.  We did put it in a plastic bag before <br/>
returning it to it's hiding spot.  We forgot to bring the Einstein and <br/>
Nat'l Geographic clues with us, so we'll have to go back for those and <br/>
also nab the new Smithsonian box.  What a great idea that is!  Thanks <br/>
