An artist friend, when I asked him to design one for me, said to write down <br/>
10 - 12 words or phrases to describe myself.  The first draft he came up <br/>
with was perfect!  I took it to a rubber stamp place.  Total cost $12 to the <br/>
store, a home-cooked meal for the artist (which he preferred over money...)<br/>

I wish my Dad were still around.  I didn't discover letterboxing til about 4 <br/>
months after his death last year.  He loved carving, he loved traveling, he <br/>
loved new places, he loved mystery; he would have loved letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great time boxing with your Dad, Annette!<br/>
