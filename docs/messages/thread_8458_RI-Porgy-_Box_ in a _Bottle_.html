If it is any consolation to you, you may hear back from this <br/>
letterbox if you included your email address in the box.  This past <br/>
summer, my daughter wanted to do a "message in a bottle".  She wrote <br/>
a moving piece to "whoever finds this bottle" to put their hand over <br/>
their heart and say the pledge of allegiance if the bottle was found <br/>
anytime near Sept. 11.  She "launched" her bottle mid-August near <br/>
Matunuck.  We received an email on September 17 from the finder of <br/>
the bottle.  He was a member of a volunteer crew that cleans up <br/>
public access areas in Narragansett (so they don't get shut down). My <br/>
daughter's bottle had traveled from Matunuck and was found on the <br/>
rocks at the end of Bass Rock Road (off Ocean Avenue) in Narragansett.<br/>

<div>I'm really glad you liked this stamp, and 
appreciate the carving compliment.  It was my favorite of the two (but of 
course).  At first I couldn't bear the thought of recarving it, but I like 
the word play of "porgy and bass", while "bass" by itself seems lame.  So, 
I guess I'll start nibbling away at it.  Besides, it all makes sense now, 
thanks to Warrior Woman.  Since her daughter's message in a bottle was 
found on this section of shore, cosmic Ying and yang required something else be 
lost.  The universe is in balance.  We can all sleep tight 
tonight.  ;&gt;D</div>
