Spent another afternoon cleaning up the huge mess at North Camp.  <br/>
Even though half of the garbage is still there, at least now <br/>
it's "presentable", all neatly stacked at campsite 859 and not strewn <br/>
almost all the way to the letterbox as it had been!  We also told the <br/>
Burlingame Camp rangers, so they should be picking up the rest of the <br/>
trash sometime soon.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in an attempt to sweeten the deal, I've put in another box <br/>
about a half mile in on the way to North Camp. From the second stone <br/>
wall corner that comes to a point right near the dirt road -just <br/>
before the "spooky" spruce grove and just after a patch of slickrock- <br/>
take about 8 steps west, then carefully pry open the lower lip of the <br/>
pink granite mouth, and out will come ... a little butterfly!<br/>

Little Red Schoolhouse.  I was the first person to do it since you <br/>
put it back out.  If you ever need help cleaning up I would be happy <br/>
to help &amp; live about 10 minutes from Burlingame.<br/>
