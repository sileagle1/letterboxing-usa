someone asked me to turn the spamguard off on the yahoogroup.  I've a)<br/>
been out of town, and b) know next to nothing about this ...<br/>
<br/>
... but this seems to be the sort of thing that looks like majority <br/>
should rule  ... so ... a) if I see a poll that says a majority of those <br/>
who care want it to go away, and b) if I can figure out how to do it (the <br/>
claim is that that I have to do it, not the moderators),  and c) this is <br/>
still actually an issue, d) I don't forget, it'll go away ...<br/>
<br/>
if, on the other hand, this message means nothing to you, I think that<br/>
is a Good Thing :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
