that different.  I found the following article at CNN.com:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/computing/02/01/geocaching/index.html<br/>
<br/>
My wife and I planted two letterboxes in Prince Edward Island and <br/>
Nova Scotia last fall, but haven't written the clues up yet.  <br/>
Fortunately, we wrote down compass bearings and other notes so that <br/>
we can write the clues.  Is anybody going up that way in the next few <br/>
months?  If so, we'll get going on the clues ASAP and post them to <br/>
the letterboxing web site, and here as well.<br/>
<br/>
I hadn't been following the discussions here much, so I didn't know <br/>
about the CT gathering until two days before (and I live in East <br/>
Haddam, CT).  So I'm sorry I missed everything.  <br/>
