to visit the letterboxes at..." We had a beautiful spring morning <br/>
looking for Jeremy and Greta's "Proposal" series in Purgatory Chasm, <br/>
and if you're ever rolling down the Massachusetts Turnpike, looking <br/>
wistfully out the windows at all those beautiful hills, you owe it to <br/>
yourself to pull off at the Auburn exit and take a walk. The site is <br/>
marvelous and the boxes are extremely well-placed. And the storybook <br/>
premise....well it's a first for us!<br/>
<br/>
And, by the way, we were excited to think we'd be the first to stamp-<br/>
in, when lo and behold, Sarah again beat us to it! Upholding an old <br/>
world, Dartmoor tradition, we're noticing more and more "first to <br/>
visits" by Sarah F. You go, girl! I think we'll have to rush out to <br/>
the new boxes in Oklahoma if we want to beat you!<br/>
<br/>
And finally, Tom (webmaster extraordinaire) wrote:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, Jay, I assume you will have completed a spring check on all <br/>
your local boxes by May 13!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Well, Tom, we sort of counted on our fingers and figure we've got <br/>
about 220 miles of letterboxes on a string out our front door, so <br/>
we're hoping you'll come down and help us out with spring cleaning!!! <br/>
(wink, wink) I did get a chance to run the Blurred Borders series <br/>
(training for the Burlington Marathon next month), and all 4 boxes <br/>
were in place. It's a rugged course, and one person had stamped-in to <br/>
the first two boxes before turning back last fall, while another <br/>
letterboxer had visited the last two boxes (going through backwards?) <br/>
the day before us. We didn't even need to use our clues, just <br/>
followed his footprints in the snow! Maybe Sarah will be the first to <br/>
stamp-in to all four.<br/>
<br/>
Springtime love to all, and hope everyone successfully logs back in <br/>
past the new egroups front end.<br/>
