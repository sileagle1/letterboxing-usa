Runs about $5 a sheet (twice the size of the pink Speedball stuff <br/>

I absolutely LOVE this stuff!<br/>

I also recommend that you buy at least 4 sheets at a time (the cost <br/>

I like and use PZ Kut.  Firmly holds the gouge but allows easy fine <br/>
turns and detail.  It is thin and I prefer to back it with a thin <br/>
plywood backing lath.  I used a soft cover stamp log so know how <br/>
frustrating it can be to not have a firm surface to work with.<br/>
<br/>
The Pinkstuff is nice, my first media, but too hard to find.  <br/>
Slightly softer than PZ I think it holds up well.  Again I prefer to <br/>
back the media for better stamping.<br/>
<br/>
Master Carve far too soft for my liking.  My signature stamp started <br/>
crumbling before 100 stamps (when I change the image)  Fine detail <br/>
will flatten out if you press too hard.  It was so thick that I <br/>
carved two images on one block and did not need a backing.  I feel I <br/>
was paying a lot for media (thickness ) that I was not using.<br/>

Go back to Home Depot and ask about plumber's gasket. It's made of red <br/>
rubber, comes in up to 1/4" thicknesses and costs about $1 per sq.ft. Lots <br/>
of rubber stamp carvers use it.<br/>

I can't believe nobody has asked this yet, but what sort of stamp do <br/>

Besides letterboxing, I play the Middle Eastern drum called the <br/>
doumbek for bellydancers. A lady wants to put a henna tattoo on her <br/>
back for certain dance occasions. It could be henna or some <br/>
waterproof ink. The lady would prefer not to get a real tattoo.<br/>
<br/>
Being a knight in service to the Holy Graal that is embodied in this <br/>

squares that are about 6" x 6".  If you go to a plumbing store,or<br/>
contractor supply place, however, you can usually buy it by the foot or<br/>
pound.<br/>
<br/>
I carved with it when I first started - and I really liked how it<br/>
carved.  It doesn't, however, always hold ink that well.  I was told by<br/>
someone to use a fine grit sandpaper over the design afterwards to<br/>
roughen the surface and it helped a bit.  I also found that pigment<br/>
inks seemed to work better than dye ones.  You needed to have a good<br/>
firm, flat place to stamp and be sure to apply even pressure to the<br/>
whole design.  Over time, I could also see where this may get brittle<br/>
or dry - depeneding on how it is used and how it is stored.  <br/>
<br/>
You might want to get a small piece to start and play around with it a<br/>
bit to see what you think.  <br/>

<br/>
Sir B - From the picture you posted I would venture to say that the stuff<br/>
you found for small artists is in fact the material I was telling you about<br/>
yesterday.  If so as you know I have had really good experience with it.  I<br/>
have found that it is a little harder to carve, especially if you are going<br/>
to be doing very small detail, however once you get the hang of it the<br/>
material is much more realiable.  I have also found that because it is<br/>
harder, the images stamp much nicer, and there is no need to back the<br/>
carving to allow for better stamping.  I am really tickled with this stuff<br/>
as far as quality and price goes, however I tend to use different materials<br/>
based on the stamp.  If I were doing ohhh something quick and simple I would<br/>
use this stuff, if I was doing something like my Tinkerbell stamp or my<br/>
Never Never Land stamp I would stick with speedball.<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree with Hoope in the matter of Master Carve.  I really like the<br/>
way it carves but I don't feel it stands up to the test in the long run.  My<br/>
signature stamp, (which I dearly love and was carved for me by Sir B) is<br/>
already starting to crumble and that just breaks my heart.<br/>
<br/>
To be really honest I have never carved on the pink stuff as I have heard<br/>
terrible things about the way it carves and its wear and tears.<br/>
<br/>
I am very interested in this plumbing gasket material though. I talked to<br/>
Iron`Bear about it who is in contruction by trade and is familar with it and<br/>
he says that he could see why it would be a good material when you consider<br/>
what it is used for and what it is made to weather against. (Everything that<br/>
goes through a toliet).  I am thinking we might have a real winner here as<br/>
far as price and durability.<br/>
<br/>
I guess alot of people are going to disagree with me as to the small artist<br/>
carving material, however I would suggest you give it a shot for some less<br/>
detailed stamps and see what you come up with, carving may be more of a<br/>
challange but the final results are well worth it.  For anyone that is<br/>
interested and local to Oregon you can check out "My backyard friend" and<br/>
"Rose of Chaos" letterboxes to see the final result I ended up with on this<br/>
material as well as my upcoming Charlie Brown series.<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least I am growing very tired of the speedball carving set and<br/>
was wondering if anyone has any suggestion on other tools?  I am really<br/>
looking from something with a handle that is bit smaller.<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well,<br/>

<br/>
Somebody is talking about about the pink stuff?!  Who?  Let me <br/>
at 'em!  It's my favorite material--although I'm always up for trying <br/>
new carving mediums, although I always find myself ultimately always <br/>
going back to the pink stuff.<br/>
<br/>
As for wear and tears, I made my signature stamp with it and after <br/>
two years and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of stampings, it's <br/>
still looking pretty good!  Frankly, it's lasted far longer than I <br/>
could have possibily hoped!<br/>
<br/>
Which isn't to say I'd recommend it to everyone.  Different people <br/>
have different preferences.  One person might like a "hard" carving <br/>
medium while other prefer a medium that "cuts like hot butter with a <br/>
sunburn".  Use what you like and tell everyone else to go jump in a <br/>
lake.  ;o)<br/>
