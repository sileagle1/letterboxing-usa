This box was inspired by an event that happened to us on this trail  a<br/>
while back.When we were hiking on this trail we came across a fawn and<br/>
were almost close enough to pet it. This event inspired us to do a 10<br/>
box wildlife series,all of which will take place at the Connecticut<br/>
Audubon in Pomfret Ct. at the Bafflin Nature Sanctuary. The Audubon is<br/>
open from dusk to dawn, seven days a week.<br/>
Directions: Coming from the east, take Rt.101 and turn right onto 169 at<br/>
Pomfret Center. Coming from the west, turn left onto 169. Go north on<br/>
169, .3 of a mile, you will see the sign for the sanctuary on the right,<br/>
pull in and park on the grass.<br/>
