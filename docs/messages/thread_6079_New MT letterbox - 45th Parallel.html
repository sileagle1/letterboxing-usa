45th Parallel Project<br/>
Madison County, near Cameron MT<br/>
Placed by Mark Sheehan on July 6, 2002<br/>
<br/>
South of the mile-30 marker on US 287 in western Montana is the turnoff <br/>
to the West Madison Recreation Area (Bureau of Land Management) and <br/>
McAtee Bridge fishing access area (Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, <br/>
and Parks). Marking the turnoff is a large BLM sign on the east side of <br/>
the highway and a smaller FWP sign on the west. Park somewhere safe, <br/>
perhaps near the Luzenac mine sign on the west side of the highway. The <br/>
McAtee Bridge letterbox is under a small cairn at the back (east) end of <br/>
the BLM sign. Use special caution crossing the road, which can be very <br/>
busy on weekends and holidays. To minimize risk of being observed, <br/>
retrieve and replace the letterbox during gaps in the automobile traffic. <br/>
Report any problems with the box to sheehan@alumni.indiana.edu.<br/>

If anyone else would like to help with this project to place letterboxes commemorating the invisible <br/>
line which runs across North America halfway between the north pole and the equator, please write.<br/>
