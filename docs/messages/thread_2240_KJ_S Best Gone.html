                    <div class="plaintext-content">I checked on Sunday and KJ"s best is gone. The owners of the ice <br/>
cream &amp; rubberstamp shop confirmed it's disappearence. They had <br/>
checked it just a couple days earlier. I will carve another stamp and <br/>
replant but I probably won't get to it until next week this one is <br/>
booked solid.<br/>
    Tommorrow is the elementary school workshop I  will let you know <br/>
how it goes. No T.V. week supporters want me to  run this and I think <br/>
it will be lots of fun. In June I will be doing another  letterboxing <br/>
school event at my sons school too. The P.E. teacher  tapped me for <br/>
that one when he heard about the other. It will be on their "Olympic" <br/>
day. My goal or plan is to move all 300 kids through a series of 4-5 <br/>
boxes in groups of 5.Of course they will be fairly easy and we have <br/>
to keep them pretty close by, I plan a set of puzzle clues. (remember <br/>
winter event puzzle)  I also want to do a coded  set of clues. Got a <br/>
box I'm gathering supplies in  got little ink boxes at KJ's <br/>
yesterday. <br/>
Anyone catch my openng day box on opening day. We had a good time <br/>
fishing but I like the odds of "catching" in letterboxing better! <br/>
