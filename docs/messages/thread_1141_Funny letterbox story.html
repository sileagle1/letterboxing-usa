A couple of my friends went to look for the box in<br/>
Wheaton and took a stamp to put in my book. But when they got their they realized that they did not bring an ink pad and I had not included one(too expensive) so they wet the impression I had made and got ink from<br/>
that to put on the stamp and then stamped the book. The others with her did not have a stamp so they did the same thing with their thumbs. So now those boxes have thumb prints as well. There is more, after they<br/>
managed to stamp the box they wanted to write something but no one had a pen (mind you this is 5 women) soooo they got a stick and dipped it in the mud and wrote the date with that. I have not seen the box yet, my<br/>
friend just told me about it. I can't wait to go check it out.<br/>

I almost didn't get to exchange stamps on the Easter Egg box in Atlanta<br/>
because I got a late start and it was almost to dark to see what I was<br/>
doing. Next time I WILL have a flashlight with me...<br/>

At least your lady friends are out there experiencing the hunt, the outdoors<br/>
and the adventure of LBing...<br/>

This is such a wonderful story, thank you for sharing it.   When we<br/>
searched out Randy's box at Harper's Ferry last year it rained all day<br/>
and we had an ink jet printed clue sheet.    We almost didn't find the<br/>
box because the clue was leaching into a psychedelic art form before our<br/>
very eyes!<br/>
<br/>
    Now our clues are placed in a polyethylene sleeve.<br/>
