Last year, the Letterboxing Alphabet postal ring was run, sharing 26 stamps from carvers all over the country.<br/>
<br/>
As that project wrapped up, some folks contributed their stamps so that I could place them on a 71 mile circuit hike here in Virginia--roughly every 3 miles.  Currently, I have 8 of the 26 letters needed.  <br/>
<br/>
Each stamp incorporated the letter into a letterbox themed image.  Basically, an "alphabet book" on letterboxing.  Some of the carvings are simple, others very elaborate.  Also, they are all sizes up to 4"X6".<br/>
<br/>
The Massanutten Trail runs in a loop in the Shenandoah Valley, and would be an excellent place to plant these.<br/>
<br/>
More info on the trail here:<br/>
http://www.americantrails.org/nationalrecreationtrails/trailNRT/Massanutten-VA.html<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for carvers for the other letters.  I currently have:  D, J, L, M, Q, R, Y and Z.<br/>
<br/>
You'll get credit as the carver--I'll do the hike (during the Fall and Winter), place the boxes and write the clues.  I'll also take care of the logbook and container.  The trail is almost in my backyard, so these won't be abandoned boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested?  or have any questions?<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to forward this to your regional groups, if you would like.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Just out of curiosity, what are the themes of the letters you <br/>
have?  Is every letter in the same theme, or they are all different?<br/>
Have any of the boxes been planted?  If so, what are they called?<br/>

Each stamp is based on something about letterboxing that has to do <br/>
with that letter, directly or indirectly.  It must also incorporate <br/>
the "Letter" in the image, like any good alphabet book.<br/>
<br/>
I'll give a couple of hiking examples (I don't want to sway the <br/>
creativity!).<br/>
<br/>
Say "H"--image could be a giant "H" with a hammock between the <br/>
uprights.<br/>
<br/>
Or "Z"--image could be someone dozing at the end of a hike, with lots <br/>
of Z's floating off into space...<br/>
<br/>
Does that help clarify it?<br/>
<br/>
Still needed are:  E, F, I, O, S, U, and W<br/>
<br/>
We are making progress!<br/>
<br/>
Please bounce back to me offline or via Atlasquest mail if you, or <br/>
anyone, wants to take a letter.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
