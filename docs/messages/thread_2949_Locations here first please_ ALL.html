I your first post you stated:<br/>
This list is so active...it would be nice if everyone would PLEASE <br/>
put their state or province FIRST in the subject line (not at the <br/>
end; that doesn't always help), so we could decide BEFORE opening <br/>
every single post whether it's something we want and/or need to read. <br/>
This sounds like every post to me.<br/>
<br/>
Then Randy responded:<br/>
Are you requesting that for clues and discussions<br/>
of specific boxes, or every post?<br/>
<br/>
Then you replied:<br/>
Not every post; this thread is not about a specific letterbox or <br/>
activity in a particular geographical area, so heading the subject <br/>
with "NC" wouldn't make sense. <br/>
HUH??<br/>
<br/>
I understood your first request, seemed reasonable to me. I depend on <br/>
a modem connection that at times is painfully slow, so I too would <br/>
benefit from a subject line containing state or region information.<br/>
<br/>
So lets say  "preface your posts with state or region information" as <br/>
in Northeast or NE, SE, NY, FL, NW, you get the idea.<br/>

Your last line is exactly what I'm trying to say; you said it much better.<br/>
<br/>
My explanation to Chip was that I would not put "NC" in the subject line for <br/>
a discussion such as the one we are having now...<br/>
