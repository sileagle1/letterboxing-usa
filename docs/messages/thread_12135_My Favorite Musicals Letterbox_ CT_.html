overlook while I found another 7 boxes in this series. I hope to go <br/>
back there on Monday (Vacation time is a beautious thing!!) to find <br/>
the last 2 boxes, and to find the 3 boxes that have me stumped.  <br/>
(Louisa, Gretl, Shirley Temple).<br/>
Just want Pink Trotters to know "Seven Brides for Seven Sisters" box <br/>
was shattered. Stamp book is fine, but ink pad was very soaked.  I <br/>
continued on my hike with very red hands. The box and its contents <br/>
are wrapped in a plastic bag and replanted in same spot. <br/>
Music Man, Brigadoon, State Fair, Summerstock, Calamity Jane and <br/>
South Pacific are fine.  However, Calamity Jane's ink pad is low on <br/>
ink. Cat Lover/Teacher/Gardener<br/>
