<br/>
To find the Old Crow:<br/>
This letterbox can be found on the Upper Shamokin Falls Trail at <br/>
Wintergreen Resort (www.wintergreenresort.com).  Please stop by the <br/>
Nature Foundation at the Trillium House for a trail map.  Proceed as if <br/>
you were going to Upper Shamokin Falls -- there are a few ways to make <br/>
your way there.  No matter how you go, you will eventually come to a <br/>
sign which looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
TO UPPER SHAMOKIN FALLS --&gt;<br/>
LAUREL SPRINGS DRIVE ACCESS ^<br/>
TO UPPER SHAMOKIN GORGE &lt;--<br/>
TO CHESTNUT SPRINGS TRAIL &lt;--<br/>
<br/>
This sign will be on your left.  Face the sign, then turn around 180 <br/>
degrees.  Across the trail and up the slope in front of you is a fallen <br/>
tree with a very large root end.  Go around the far side of this log <br/>
and look inside the root end where the center has rotted out.  It's <br/>
best to look in from what used to be the top of the tree.  There you <br/>
will find the box.<br/>
