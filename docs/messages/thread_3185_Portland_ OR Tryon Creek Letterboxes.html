Portland and found all 4 of the Boxes in this Cryptic series. <br/>
 But a Question to Ryan Carpenter...As you stamped into one box, you <br/>
wrote that you found all 5 boxes that you knew about in this park.  <br/>
What is the fifth box?  Is it a mystery box? or just one that I have <br/>
overlooked on the Portland page.  Also, I have to agree with the <br/>
comments about letterbox #4 (Iron Mountain)  The number is off.<br/>

*chuckle*  Yes, there are five boxes in the park, but one of them <br/>
isn't listed on the letterboxing site.  Not ALL clues are there, you <br/>
know.  You need to have the right contacts.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
A couple of months ago, Wendy Gault posted to this group asking for <br/>
volunteers to search for a box she hid about two years ago to check <br/>
that it was still there before posting it publicly.  A select few of <br/>
us (including myself!) volunteered, and she e-mailed the clue to us.  <br/>
(She doesn't live in the area, so she couldn't check it herself.)  I <br/>
guess she hasn't gotten around to making the clue public yet, but the <br/>
box is still there.  Since it's her box and her clue, though, I'll <br/>
keep mum on where in the park it is.  You'll have to pry that <br/>
information out of her cold, dead hands.  Well, hopefully it won't <br/>
come to that!  =)<br/>

RYAN!!  You are so funny!!  Most of what you say is correct, ACCEPT the<br/>
clues are posted.  Currently they reside on my web pages under "What's New?"<br/>
July archive and can be found by wondering through the "webring".<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'll resend my request to the Webmasters to list my letterboxes on<br/>
the map again.<br/>
