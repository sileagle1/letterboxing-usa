We have never heard of a bonus box until yesterday when we found <br/>
one.  We were searching for a box that was supposed to be in a log.  <br/>
After a short while of looking around the log LittleAngel found <br/>
it... or so we thought.  As we opened it we noticed that the stamp <br/>
did not look at all like we had expected.  Then we noticed it was a <br/>
bonus box which was placed just 2 days before.  How lucky were we?  <br/>
We planned to get this box on our way through this town on Friday, <br/>
but we were running late, so we looked on the way home Sunday.  We <br/>
would have probably missed it if we went Friday.  Anyways, we did <br/>
find the regular box in the correct log a few minutes later :-)<br/>
<br/>
So... how common are Bonus Boxes?  Are we supposed to keep quiet <br/>
about where it is?<br/>

What a fun "bonus" for you!  If I were you, I wouldn't tell people <br/>
about it.  That, to me, is the major point of a bonus box--the <br/>
surprise and fun of discovering it.  If the planter intended for <br/>
everyone to know it was there, they could have just posted it as its <br/>
own clue.<br/>

Oh, yes.  I love surprises and when I planted my first box on <br/>
Thanksgiving, I added with the help of my great-niece, a bonus box if <br/>
you found the first.  Since many of my letterboxing friends are 4 <br/>
decades younger, they all have been thrilled to find it and replaced <br/>
it very carefully - they also stop by to tell me!  I like the idea of <br/>
keeping them secret, too!<br/>
<br/>
I just got back from a trip to RI to visit my daughter and did 3 <br/>
boxes on I90 on the way there and 2 on I90 on the way back and 15 <br/>
with my daughter and son while visiting there.  So much fun.  Since I <br/>
live in NW Ohio, LB's are few and far between so, this was wonderful <br/>
to find so many along the way and out there.  Some were not found and <br/>
I'm guessing that was because of all the snow on the ground!  I'll be <br/>
back in the summer.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the fun goes to Elba Onions, Todd, CSCM, Team Primates, &amp; <br/>

Happy New Year to all.<br/>
