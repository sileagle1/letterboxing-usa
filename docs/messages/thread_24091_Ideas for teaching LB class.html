                    <div class="plaintext-content">I approached the director of our small local museum about having a <br/>
letterboxing class and they are very excited about it.  I've only been <br/>
LB for about 8 mos, and have less than 10 finds. (But I did plant the <br/>
first boxes in our county.)<br/>
<br/>
We'll hold a family-oriented class in late March.  I'd like your ideas <br/>
on what new letterboxers would need to know.  We'll also let the <br/>
kids/adults try their hand at carving their own stamp.  At this point, <br/>
I'm thinking erasers and using bent pencil eraser ends for carving. <br/>
(that metal opening with the pencil eraser removed).  Trying to keep it <br/>
safe for all ages.  <br/>
<br/>
What basics would you have liked to have learned in a newbie class?  <br/>
Any suggestions on carving medium/tools for us to use?<br/>
<br/>
BTW--because the museum is in a mansion in the historic section of <br/>
town, I'll be planting a box there and giving clues for a walking <br/>
(urban)tour of the neighborhood. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">They have letterboxes in the heart of New York City.  So you can plant some <br/>
in town.  I found one under the phone in a  public telephone booth accross the <br/>
street fro the Empire State Building as well as one in Central Park.  There <br/>
are many more in the City but I don't live there.  I live in the suburbs.  You <br/>
may be able to plant some in town.<br/>
