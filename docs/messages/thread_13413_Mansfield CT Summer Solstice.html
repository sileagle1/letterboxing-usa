might be of interest. On June 21, all day long at Mansfield Hollow, <br/>
there will be a Day in the Park Summer Solstice event. It is <br/>
sponsered by the DEP and hosted by the Friends of Mansfield Hollow. <br/>
Highlights include hiking, biking, kayaking, and more, including <br/>
letterboxing at 10:15 am. There will be a special event stamp. For <br/>

Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend since that day is <br/>
training for my summer job at Mansfield parks and rec day camp. <br/>
However, I thought I'd let others know since it seems like it will <br/>
be an excellent event.<br/>
Happy Trails!<br/>
