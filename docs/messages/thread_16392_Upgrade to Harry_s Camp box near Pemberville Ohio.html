I am new as can be to this letterboxing sport, but my boy and I planted our<br/>
first box (listed in Ohio, nearest city - Pemberville) a while back and I<br/>
went by there Sunday to check on it. It was still in hiding, undisturbed,<br/>
and as yet unstamped, so I upgraded the notebook with a cool leather-cover<br/>
parchment notebook that I found at a historical reenactor's festival this<br/>
summer (it was cheaper than the small strathmore pads and looked perfect for<br/>
letterboxing). I plan to make up some more of my own - pretty simple<br/>
design - for future letterboxes. Happy hunting.<br/>

      Don't be discouraged - it takes time for a good thing to get<br/>
around! I bet this post will help bring some action to that letterbox!<br/>
The important thing is that it's a great activity to spend with your son<br/>
while enjoying nature.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

Just stopping by to check up on the box was a nice mini adventure, and a<br/>
good excuse for a short walk in the woods on a perfect day. There are only a<br/>
few Ohio boxes so far, so we are preparing the next one for hiding. The<br/>
leather pads are simple enough that my 3 year old boy can help make them.<br/>
