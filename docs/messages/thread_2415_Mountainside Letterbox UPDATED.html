Mountainside Park<br/>

<br/>
DIRECTIONS: Mountainside Park is a Morris County Park in northern Morris <br/>
County, New Jersey. From Interstate 287 get off at Route 23 heading south. <br/>
Just before the second light turn right and keep bearing right onto West <br/>
Parkway for about 1/2 mile to the first intersection with a 4-way stop. Turn <br/>
right onto Mountain Avenue, which will pass under Interstate 287. Once you <br/>
pass under the bridge the park is immediately on your right.  Park your car <br/>
along the right side of the road. If you come to a no trespassing sign, <br/>
you've gone too far.  Note, you will probably not see any signs saying you <br/>
are at Mountainside Park. Alternately, from Route 23 North in Pompton Plains, <br/>
take 511 ALT to make a U-turn onto Route 23 South and follow the directions <br/>
above.<br/>
<br/>
Look for Green Acres signs on trees.<br/>
Search along roadside for sky blue blaze trail.<br/>
Once sky blue blazes are located start out on trail. <br/>
Take dark blue blaze trail.<br/>
Blazes will start to alternate from dark to sky blue in no specific order, <br/>
stay on trail.<br/>
Eventually you'll see a second campfire off the main path, to the right down <br/>
an unmarked trail.<br/>
