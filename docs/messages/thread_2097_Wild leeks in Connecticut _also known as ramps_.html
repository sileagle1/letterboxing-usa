                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many years ago, as a child, I used to go out into the woods every <br/>
spring with a plastic bag and harvest a bunch of wild leeks.  I lived <br/>
in Colchester, Connecticut at the time, and now I live elsewhere in <br/>
Southeastern Connecticut.  <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if any of the Connecticut letterboxers had come <br/>
across wild leeks in their travels, and if so, where.  Wild leeks <br/>
smell like a combination of salami and onion.  To me, a wonderful, <br/>
earthy smell. I have a favorite family recipe I'd like to make <br/>
(nostalgia and all), and leeks are due to start coming up in the next <br/>
few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
For those that don't know what wild leeks look like, go to <br/>
http://wild-leeks.com -- they have some good pictures, recipes, and <br/>
other information.  Another great site is http://www.earthy.com<br/>
<br/>
I'd really appreciate any help!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
