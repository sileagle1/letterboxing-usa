                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did a bit of traveling this weekend and picked up a few stamps on <br/>
the way.<br/>
<br/>
Started Saturday morning by snagging Kancamangusdabull's new H2O Fire <br/>
box, in Providence, RI.<br/>
<br/>
Stopped off in Voluntown, CT, to try to drop in on the gathering <br/>
taking place there, but I spotted no letterboxers -- only hoards of <br/>
boy scouts.  The Rhododendron Preserve was a great little place and <br/>
the Drew Clan's Father's Day was my first Connecticut box.  <br/>
<br/>
On my way back from a party in New Jersey Sunday, I hunted down <br/>
Steven Jachera's Campgaw box in Mahwah, my first for that state.  The <br/>
weather and the foliage were incredible.  It was nice to have a <br/>
positive experience in New Jersey for once!<br/>
<br/>
I had hoped to return to RI with enough time to find Wanda's <br/>
Polish#1, but torturous traffic prevented me.  Maybe next weekend!<br/>

<br/>I, too, did some letterboxing in NJ this weekend ............. down at Merril Creek.  Couldn't find 
<br/>one but did find Charmed.  What a beautiful day.  Hope to get to the Campgaw box soon.
<br/>
<br/>Hope you come back to Jersey soon and enjoy our beautiful mountains and rivers.

<br/>
My unhappy New Jersey experiences revolve entirely around bad traffic <br/>
and an ex-fiance.  But hopefully my opinion of the state will change <br/>
with every letterbox I find!<br/>
