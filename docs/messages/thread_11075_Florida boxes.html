We did find Shh! There's a secret.  Good directions and lovely park.  <br/>
Ranger Ruth got into the concept of letterboxing.  She probably had <br/>
already contacted Tom and Audrey about the poison ivy.<br/>

I had the chance to stop by and see if "Snowflakes" were still falling in <br/>
Florida- am pleased to report that yes, they are. However, the landmark (V <br/>
log) at which the box is hiding has been wildly overgrown and difficult to <br/>
located due to the recent rain and hot weather. The box itself is intact and <br/>
dry, but not visible to the casual passerby- quite well hidden under some <br/>
ground debris. To those on the search, being it's florida, a stick would be <br/>
advisible when searching- it's a jungle down here!<br/>
- regards,<br/>
M.<br/>

&gt;We're sorry that "Snowflakes are Falling in Florida" couldn't be found.<br/>
&gt;Unfortunately, we won't be back to check on it until next year.  If anyone <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;the Deerfield Beach (Broward County) can check on it for us, we'd <br/>
&gt;appreciate<br/>
&gt;it!  You may contact us off line at Dandshoo@aol.com for directions that <br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt;be as specific as we can make them long distance.   Thanks!  D and Shoo<br/>
