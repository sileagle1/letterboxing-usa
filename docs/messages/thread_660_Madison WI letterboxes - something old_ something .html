                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everybody,<br/>
I replaced the David Crosby letterbox at Turville Point Conservation <br/>
Park today in a slightly different location.<br/>
I also placed a new Tribute Series box dedicated to Otis Redding.<br/>
The clues and images are at the following url:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
For those Gen X'ers out there, Otis Redding was a wonderfully talented<br/>
R&amp;B singer/songwriter from the 1960's. He and four members of his band<br/>
died on the way to a performance in Madison in a plane crash in 1967.<br/>
I was a young teenager in New Mexico at the time... "Sittin' on the<br/>
Dock of the Bay" and "Try a Little Tenderness" are two of his songs I<br/>
remember best. We moved to Madison from Las Cruces, NM, <br/>
two years later, in 1969...<br/>
I just found out that he wrote "Respect", which was <br/>
recorded by a 16-year-old Aretha Franklin in the spring of 1967!<br/>
He was inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame<br/>
in 1989.... I'm going to be in Cleveland this autumn, hope I get a <br/>
chance to visit. Otis Redding's birthday was 9/9... too bad I didn't<br/>
get the letterbox out on that day... oh well, September will have to do....<br/>
I tried to kinda match the background color of the usual LB-NA<br/>
listing... but I don't know how successful I was. Is there a way I<br/>
can match that? I also changed the background color on the <br/>
Much Ado About Nothing pages... but I guess you'd have to change<br/>
that on the site as well. When you add these, Mitch, could you please<br/>
delete the previous listing for Turville Point?<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Deborah<br/>

<br/>
Your Otis Redding stamp is incredible (as is your State House stamp). <br/>
I used to like Otis Redding a lot too, but I remember him as looking <br/>
a little plumper than as shown on your stamp. I think he would like <br/>
it a lot too!<br/>
<br/>
I found the color combination on your page a little hard to read. <br/>
Mitch's suggestions worked for me when I was wrestling with page <br/>
colors. I'd be glad to try to help also if you like.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
<br/>

I just now went to your new page and saw the Otis Redding stamp.<br/>
Words fail me - that stamp is beyond description!!  It is beautiful, and<br/>
SO well done. Thanks so much for sharing it with us.<br/>
<br/>
As I am trying to do a couple of stamps with a recognizabe face image,<br/>
what can you share asto technique. Did the fae image start as a<br/>
photograph and get manipulated? And, what is the xylene pen you mention<br/>
to transfer the image?<br/>

Carving the face actually took a whole lot less time than those little<br/>
letters! <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Did the face image start as a photograph and get manipulated?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and I just increased the contrast some so I could see the darks<br/>
and lights more easily. This can be done in a graphics program or by<br/>
photocopying. With a photocopy transfer that hasn't been reversed, <br/>
I just carve out the white areas of the eraser, and leave the dark <br/>
transferred areas. When you get to that point where taking out too<br/>
much is too easy, make some test prints as you go. Might have to<br/>
add some highlight carving lines. You can also try getting half-tones <br/>
by doing some fine linear carving or cross-hatching ~ but I haven't tried yet!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;also, what is the xylene pen you mention to transfer the image?<br/>
<br/>
That's a xylene-based blending pen (usually used for blending colors<br/>
with markers and color pencils) ~ the one I have is called a Colorless<br/>
Blender Design Art Marker by Eberhard Faber from the Nasco catalog. <br/>
Probably can be found in larger art supply stores. Hold the photocopy<br/>
against the eraser copy side down, go over with the blender pen to <br/>
transfer... you get clean, precise transfers.<br/>
Another good way to transfer photocopied drawings is to use a iron <br/>
(not too hot, or it melts the medium... don't ask how I know... I just <br/>
know...)<br/>

(oh... and helps if you can find a photo that has lots of lights and<br/>
shadow on it... it's hard to make contrast if there isn't any to begin with!)<br/>
