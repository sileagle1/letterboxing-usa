<br/>
I'm going to be passing through eastern Pennsylvania<br/>
and western Virginia. There are a couple of boxes<br/>
along our planned route, and we're wondering a few<br/>
things. If anyone can hlep with these questions,<br/>
please let me know. <br/>
<br/>
First, we're looking at some boxes in Greentown, PA,<br/>
The Promised Land and Panther Swamp, and also the<br/>
Carlisle Indian School in Carlisle PA. Has anyone<br/>
visited these boxes lately, and what is the snowcover<br/>
like, if any is left? <br/>
<br/>
Second, we're also considering stopping at the<br/>
Shanandoah Vineyards in Edinburgh, VA, and possibly<br/>
the WildFlower in Harrisonburg (I understand that<br/>
Stargazer is reported MIA). Anyone been to either of<br/>
these lately?<br/>
<br/>

Hey, Mike --<br/>
<br/>
Panther Swamp is one of mine, and I live about 15 miles south of the park. <br/>
There's still two feet (or more!) of snow in my yard right now, so I would <br/>
expect that those boxes are still pretty snowed in. The temperature is <br/>
supposed to get up to the 50s this weekend, so we may get some thawing. On <br/>
the other hand, temps have been in the single digits at night these last <br/>
couple of days, so the snow is pretty solid. In fact, I was out today <br/>
checking a box and the snow was frozen so hard that my feet weren't even <br/>
breaking the surface of the snow (and I'm 6'2" and no lightweight). I <br/>
haven't heard any recent reports on the Panther Swamp box, but perhaps <br/>
someone else on the list has been to one or the other of the boxes this year.<br/>
