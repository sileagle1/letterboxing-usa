                    <div class="plaintext-content">I believe some of the problems occur on this list from repetitive questions from new letterboxers can be attributed to the way we approach our lives. We live in a "don't repair it - just replace it age". Instant gratification seems to be what SOME folks want. Letterboxing strays from that ideology as you have to figure out clues. That is part of the beauty of Letterboxing. When SOME new folks start letterboxing they may plant really easy letterboxes,i.e., drive to X, walk 3 paces north and presto here is a letterbox. When others stop looking for their letterbox then they either move on and try another hobby or they will start making their letterbox and clues more interesting. We have some folks that for what ever reason, find a clue page and either go look for the letterbox or may use "Contact the Placer". Many of our letterbox clue pages can be "Googled" and accessed by folks that have not read anything about Letterboxing, either via chat list or on the home page. They have never seen the FAQS pages nor know how to access them. This could be the source of some of the poor rehiding of letterboxes.  While they may think that the chat list is their opportunity to be a quick learning tool I feel it is more appropriate to direct them to the multitude of information on the LBNA web site, Silent Doug's site,Ravenhouse site or any other linked site listed on the LBNA links that have been set up for just that purpose. I do not believe that every time some one asks a question that has been asked 12 times in the past an answer has to be forth coming on the list. Why not contact them directly and give them your input and direct them to the proper web site or link.  There was a request posted on the list about 1 year ago "How can I be removed from this list". Several posts were made "You got on it-you can figure out how to get off it" , "Go to the unsub and click on". This went on for the better part of the day,and after I contacted the folks directly I found out that it was a business that had been set up by an unknown perp over the weekend and their inbox had been flooded by our chat list spamming them and screwing up their business, and I was able to direct them so that they could unsub.. Some times direct communication works best rather than chat list posting. So if a "newbie" doesn't want to figure out where to do their research or doesn't know how to do their research why not either post just the link or if you feel like helping do it privately and it will keep the the rest of us from reading the answer for the 12th time.<br/>
