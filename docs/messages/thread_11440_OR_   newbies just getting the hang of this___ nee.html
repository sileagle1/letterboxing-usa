(Ryan's and Funhog's).  I know we were in the right areas but short <br/>
of bulldozing the Gorge we were "stumped".  Please provide an <br/>
additional clue so that we are in the right area of if the locations <br/>
have changed.<br/>
<br/>
We were unable to locate the Multnomah and Horsetail boxes but we <br/>
also did not spend much time hunting them.<br/>
<br/>
We found Triple Falls with no problem, and Funhog's Sandy Delta was <br/>
easy.<br/>
<br/>
We found Ryan's Eagle Creek but cannot get a fix on the other <br/>
one "near the falls named for an Indian goddess". We looked all over <br/>
the place for it nothing is there.  Please help.<br/>
<br/>
All of the PCC Sylvania campus - alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
Lost Letterbox is alive and well as of 3/23/02<br/>
<br/>
We found #2 at Tualatin Nature Center 3/23/01 and ran out of time - <br/>
but the Creek Trail is closed - under water... I hope the box out <br/>
there is up higher than the water!!<br/>
<br/>
Fanno Creek is a very large swamp right now and you cannot get to the <br/>
box without a boat.<br/>
<br/>
We found 2 at Tryon Creek. <br/>
<br/>
We cannot wait for longer days - hiking home in the dark gets old.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for placing boxes - we are hooked and having fun - even with a <br/>
bit of frustration, we will keep trying....... <br/>
<br/>
Where do we go for new and/or changed clues. <br/>

&gt; (Ryan's and Funhog's).<br/>
<br/>
The Ponytail Falls box I replaced should be exactly where my clues <br/>
say they are, and I'm not sure how to make them anymore clearer to <br/>
help you out.  I can say it seems to be in a particularly tricky spot <br/>
since I've had many people e-mailing me saying they couldn't find it--<br/>
even when I was able to confirm they were looking the right area!--<br/>
but then eventually somebody else later does find it.  There are <br/>
certain boxes that are devilishly slippery, and the Ponytail Falls <br/>
letterbox is one of them!<br/>
<br/>
As for Funhog's box--I assume you mean the Octopus box since that's <br/>
the only one I can think of she hid near there--the clues seemed <br/>
pretty straight-forward and I'm not sure why you'd have difficult <br/>
finding that one.  It doesn't have a reputation as being "slippery".<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We were unable to locate the Multnomah and Horsetail boxes but we <br/>
&gt; also did not spend much time hunting them.<br/>
<br/>
The Multnomah Falls box is probably the most famous box in the <br/>
Portland area for being "slippery".  Tales of people going out <br/>
multiple times to hunt the box down--even when they're looking around <br/>
the right group of five trees--are legendary!  It's not a box I would <br/>
recommend a newbie to find.  It's a tough box.  Don't let the clue <br/>
fool you, that box is difficult to find, not moderate!!!!  =)  For a <br/>
newbie, I'd even suggest the box is impossible to find!  <br/>
<br/>
The Horsetail Falls box used to have straight-forward clues (it was <br/>
the first box I ever found!), but I've heard that the "finger" <br/>
mentioned in the clue is now missing which makes the box much more <br/>
difficult to find.  I haven't verified myself if it's truely missing <br/>
or not--it was a pretty LARGE rock and I was quite surprised to learn <br/>
it disappeared--but if it is, I guess you'd just have to search that <br/>
whole rock-slide area to find the box.  It's definitely not as easy <br/>
as it used to be without a finger to point the way.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We found Ryan's Eagle Creek but cannot get a fix on the other <br/>
&gt; one "near the falls named for an Indian goddess". We looked all<br/>
&gt; over the place for it nothing is there.  Please help.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't looked for Funhog's Eagle Creek yet.  It's on my to-do <br/>
list, but she hid it AFTER I passed through the area hiding my box so <br/>
now I have to go back and look for hers.  My work is never done.  <br/>
*sigh*  =)<br/>
<br/>
I don't think any of this will be much of a help, but good luck!  =)<br/>

We found HT LB this summer and there is something you could conceive <br/>
as a finger. In any case we found the box, after looking in the <br/>
wrong place for a while that "marked" by a rock we thought was more <br/>
likely a finger.<br/>

what I know (or think I know!) about the following:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;We found #2 at Tualatin Nature Center 3/23/01 and ran out of time - <br/>
<br/>
but the Creek Trail is closed - under water... I hope the box out <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Some of the ones at Tualatin are missing.  I was there on Feb 23 and am quite <br/>
sure that #1 is gone (as you no doubt discovered); I found #2 (like you) and <br/>
#4.  The Nail family reported that #3 is gone, tho I didn't look for that one <br/>
because the Creek trail was closed while I was there too--so I also couldn't <br/>
look for #8.  I did search for 6 &amp; 7 and am quite sure they're gone too--tho <br/>
you might want to confirm this with the person who placed them.  #5 is still <br/>
a mystery to me--I was never convinced I was in the correct spot, so it may <br/>
well be there even tho I didn't find it.  Ryan has suggested this one can be <br/>
tricky to find. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Fanno Creek is a very large swamp right now and you cannot get to the <br/>
<br/>
box without a boat.<br/>
<br/>
One of the Fanno Creek-Greenway boxes is missing (list-serve group consensus <br/>
appears to agree).  Ummm, I think it's the Greenway box...it's the one where <br/>
you cross over on the big log.  The other one was soggy, but still there on <br/>
Mar 1.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;We found 2 at Tryon Creek. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to the 4 placed by Der Mad Stamper, there's also an "orphan" box <br/>
placed by Wendy (if I remember the name correctly).  I found the clues to <br/>
this one (called Tryon Creek Orphan LB) by searching the archives--since the <br/>
link to it on the LBNA site didn't seem to work for me.  I don't think I've <br/>
kept those clues, but if I run across them I'll send them to you.  Or maybe <br/>
someone out there has the link to Wendy's website--or a search engine would <br/>
reveal it?  &lt;--that would be faster than searching the archives, like I did.<br/>

Good hunting!<br/>

The clue is at <br/>
http://home.earthlink.net/~wendygault/letterbox/Publish/page4.html<br/>
<br/>
Wendy's HTML software apparently changed the page when she went to <br/>
save it and the link has never been corrected on the LbNA website <br/>
since.  (The dangers of automated web creating programs never end....)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, Wendy carves some amazing stamps, and those folks in the <br/>
Portland area shouldn't pass up the opportunity to nab one of these <br/>
rare collectors item!  It's her only box in the Pacific Northwest as <br/>
far as I know!<br/>
