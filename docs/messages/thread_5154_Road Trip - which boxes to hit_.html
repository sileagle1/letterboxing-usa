<br/>
I am looking for a little help/guidance.  I am getting<br/>
ready for a brief vacation before the chaos of Summer<br/>
Camps, and am headed down to VA Beach to do some<br/>
boxing with AD.  I have decided drive and would like<br/>
to pick up some boxes along the way.<br/>
<br/>
For all of you that know your areas best, I am looking<br/>
for suggestions on which ones to add to the list. <br/>
Short hikes with easy access to and from the highway<br/>
are what I am looking for.  My route is 95 from RI,<br/>
cross the GW bridge, to the NJ Pike, and then down<br/>
across Rt 1 &amp; 13 to the Bay Bridge/Tunnel.  The Garden<br/>
State Pkwy to the Cape May Ferry or up and across the<br/>
Tapenzee Bridge are possibilities as well.<br/>
<br/>
TIA for any direction you can send me ;o)<br/>
