                    <div class="plaintext-content">   Today was my first day letterboxing! I found Sunbathing Turtle and<br/>
Runway something (in Tuscarora Creek Park) in Leesburg many moons ago,<br/>
before I had a stamp or notebook. I could not find directions for them<br/>
today (site is down) so I tried to find them by memory - didn't find<br/>
them. I did find Erik's Box in Red Rock Park (slightly damp and buried<br/>
under clay-mud, but in good shape!) and then went to find the Goose<br/>
Creek boxes. I couldn't find Pillar of the Letterboxing Community, but<br/>
I did find Rusted Butterfly - and it was in great condition!<br/>
   I also found, on a log nearby, a stamper's journal! The name on it<br/>
is Savannah and the stamps in it all looked to be local to Northern<br/>
Virginia. It looked like the stamper was there on 8/2/04, from the ink<br/>
color used. I took the book home for fear it would get wet or<br/>
vandalized if I left it there. I put a note with my contact info in<br/>
the letterbox, and a "FOUND" note at the entrance to the park. If<br/>
anyone knows Savannah, please tell her (I assume "her") to contact me<br/>
at kauket (at) yahoo (dot) com and arrange to retrieve the book! (I'd<br/>
be happy to meet at the same park where the book was found.) I really<br/>
want to be able to return this journal to its owner!<br/>
