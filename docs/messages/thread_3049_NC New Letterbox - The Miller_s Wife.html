You will get wet; please take along a dry hand towel in a waterproof bag so <br/>
you don't smear the logbook or your stamp.  Wear foot protection; river <br/>
bottom is rocky and uneven.   PFD's for youngsters a MUST!   If you're <br/>
short, a taller friend whose shoulders you can rely on may come in handy!  <br/>
Friendly canine alarms on premises.  NOTE: If you can't see the rocks that <br/>
go across the river,  the water is too high and fast - do not attempt to <br/>
retrieve the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
To find this box<br/>
You must heed<br/>
A number of warnings<br/>
Of water and speed.<br/>
<br/>
About the speed -<br/>
Take caution, you!<br/>
Curves and trees<br/>
Obstruct the view.<br/>
<br/>
Drivers crazy, drivers rude<br/>
Drivers just impatient with you;<br/>
Let them by, they don't know<br/>
You're looking for the place to go.<br/>
<br/>
Use the Hog to turn around<br/>
If first time you miss this ground.<br/>
<br/>
In the Higgins<br/>
The trick, you see<br/>
Is North or South?<br/>
Which shall it be?<br/>
<br/>
The Miller's Wife<br/>
(of fine old folks)<br/>
Waits for you<br/>
Near by the Volks.<br/>
<br/>
Park on gravel,<br/>
Have no fear<br/>
For a Letterboxer<br/>
Homesteads here!<br/>
<br/>
Descend the steps<br/>
To tree on right;<br/>
Ponder then<br/>
This ancient site.<br/>
<br/>
Where was the dam?<br/>
Where'd be the mill?<br/>
What hap'd to them?<br/>
What made them still?<br/>
<br/>
Unwrap your compass<br/>
At this place<br/>
Find Two Oh Oh<br/>
On its face.<br/>
<br/>
Where the rocks<br/>
Seem to straddle<br/>
Here's your challenge:<br/>
Wade or paddle?<br/>
<br/>
Knee-deep, waist deep<br/>
To the middle<br/>
Cross, however<br/>
Then this riddle:<br/>
<br/>
Stay in water<br/>
Look up high<br/>
In a rock<br/>
There is an eye<br/>
<br/>
Deep the socket<br/>
Perfectly round<br/>
Inside, the Miller's Wife<br/>
You've Found!<br/>
<br/>
Through the dam<br/>
And up you'll see<br/>
Footholds firm<br/>
Bring her to thee.<br/>
<br/>
