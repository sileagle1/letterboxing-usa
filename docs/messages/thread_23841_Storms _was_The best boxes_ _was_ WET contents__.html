&gt; We just had some great flood conditions (great if you happen to be a <br/>
flood<br/>
&gt; lookin' to happen) here in northeastern IL last night.  I was <br/>
absolutely<br/>
&gt; compelled to take a break from cleaning my flooded basement<br/>
<br/>
I hear you on those storms and floods.  My office is in South Holland <br/>
and not only did our basement flood, but we didn't have power all <br/>
day.  Luckily we had a generator to run the pumps, but we couldn't do <br/>
any work.  And tomorrow is payday.  I hope our employees understand <br/>
when their checks aren't there in the morning. :-|<br/>
