<br/>
My mom and I are about to embark on a trip to MN from MD. We will be <br/>
traveling through MD, WV, PA (briefly), OH, IN, IL, and WI. On <br/>
Interstates 70, 68, 79, 70, 74, 39, 90, and 94. <br/>
<br/>
I have done my best to mark out some boxes along the way, but if you <br/>
know of some that are a nice break from lots of driving and are close <br/>
to the highway, I would love to hear from you off list.  I think we <br/>
are going to spend a day just in Columbus OH! Thank you in advance <br/>
for your help. Maybe we will run into you along the trails!<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year! <br/>

The Creekside letterbox near Morgantown, WV is not far off I-68. It's a <br/>
little visited box by the Jolly G-man, and you can park near the church to <br/>
make it a nice (short) little hike.<br/>

There are just a few boxes in MN. Two are in Minneapolis, although I <br/>
think the Rock of Racial Harmony Letterbox is missing. I went <br/>
searching for it about a week ago and found an empty hollow and a <br/>
fairly new campfire ring near by. Sad. <br/>
<br/>
If your feeling so inclined, we few letterboxers here in MN would <br/>
love to have a new box to search for! (hint, hint) :)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Travelling!<br/>

Sometimes it helps to plant a box or two as well.  ;o)  When I first <br/>
placed a box in my hometown of San Luis, there weren't any boxes for <br/>
a hundred miles in any direction.  After a few months, another box <br/>
would pop up here and there--usually from letterboxers that drove <br/>
all the way out mostly just to pick up my letterboxes!  And since <br/>
they were in the area, they dropped a couple off of their own along <br/>
the way.<br/>
<br/>
Then, a year or two later, BAM!  Letterboxing absolutely EXPLODED <br/>
and San Luis probably has more letterboxes than any other city in <br/>
California.  It's a great thing to see happen.  =)  But it didn't <br/>
happen overnight, either....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been getting a number of emails telling me the Rock of Racial<br/>
Harmony box is missing, but I have a confirmed find report from as<br/>
recently as mid November, so I think all of you just have to try<br/>
harder to find it! Ha ha ha ha!!<br/>
<br/>
I think the best way to encourage letterboxing in MN is to show your<br/>
friends and neighbors how it is done. Minnesota has a bajillion<br/>
geocachers, and everyone loves the St. Paul winter carnival medallion<br/>
hunt, so you shouldn't have too much trouble expaining to anyone how<br/>
the game is played. Get out and hide a few boxes yourself and soon MN<br/>
will reach a critical mass of interest.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I hid a new letterbox in a favorite hiking place in<br/>
Bloomington when I was on my way out of town after Christmas. Because<br/>
I was on my way to the airport and a flight delay suddenly allowed me<br/>
time to hide the box, I wasn't really prepared. So if any of you first<br/>
finders would be kind enough to put the log book and stamp in some<br/>
small ziploc bags and add ballpoint pen to the box, I would much<br/>
appreciate it.<br/>
