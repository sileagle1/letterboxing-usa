section since I first posted them. Since they are my very first two and<br/>
probably the first two in Jefferson County, I don't want them to be<br/>
overlooked. So I am posting this one more time to be sure they get<br/>
noticed.<br/>
<br/>
Crooked River Ranch Letterbox #1 was placed by funhog on 8/1/01 in<br/>
Jefferson County, Terrebonne, Oregon<br/>
To the trailhead:<br/>
Just north of Terrebonne on Hwy 97, turn west on Lower Bridge Rd. There<br/>
is a highway sign for Crooked River Ranch at this intersection. Follow<br/>
the signs on to the Ranch. Once you have made a 90 degree left turn you<br/>
will be on Chinook Ave. From Chinook follow the green and white signs<br/>
to<br/>
the Fire Hall. Once at the Fire Hall, with the building on your right,<br/>
proceed on Shad Rd which changes to West Peninsula 2.2 miles to Sundown<br/>
Canyon Rd. Turn left and park at the end of the road. Slightly downhill<br/>
and in front of the last house on the left there is a trail down to the<br/>
Deschutes River.<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
Once you reach the river level you will be at a grassy spot. Proceed<br/>
upstream. The trail will pass bunchgrasses, a few rocks, juniper trees<br/>
and some small thickets. Head for the sound of rushing water. The dirt<br/>
will run out entirely when the trail reaches a large rock tumble and<br/>
the<br/>
small rapid you've been listening too will be just ahead. Stop on this<br/>
last patch of dirt. Do a 180 degree turn. Walk four steps. Do a 90<br/>
degree clockwise turn. You will be facing two very large rocks. The<br/>
letterbox is nestled behind the rock to your left. Remember: this is<br/>
rattlesnake country. Watch where you put those hands and feet!<br/>
(Approximately 1 mile round trip.)<br/>

Crooked River Ranch Letterbox #2 was placed by funhog on 8/2/01 in<br/>
Jefferson County, Terrebonne, Oregon<br/>
To the trailhead:<br/>
Just north of Terrebonne on Hwy 97, turn west on Lower Bridge Rd. There<br/>
is a highway sign for Crooked River Ranch at this intersection. Follow<br/>
the signs on to the Ranch. Once you have made a 90 degree left turn you<br/>
will be on Chinook Ave. Take the second left on to Badger Rd. which<br/>
will<br/>
turn into Blacktail Dr. When you reach Quail Rd. turn right. Take the<br/>
second left on River Rd. Go to the end and park at Steelhead Falls<br/>
Campground.<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
Walk the trail to the falls. Once you reach Steelhead Falls proceed<br/>
downstream. On the opposite side of the river you will see a vertical<br/>
basalt cliff that goes directly into the water. At the end of this<br/>
cliff<br/>
there is a small string of boulders in the river. At this point the<br/>
river becomes wide and flat. On the right side of the trail you will<br/>
pass a large sandstone cliff. In the lowest, black layer you will see<br/>
lots of carved graffitti. Pass by the tallest section of this wall. In<br/>
the shorter secton that follows look for "the Stoners 98" Just beyond<br/>
this graffitti is a large juniper tree. Letterbox #2 lives in a hole at<br/>
the base of this tree. Remember: this is rattlesnake country. Watch<br/>
where you put those hands and feet! (Approximately 1 1/2 mile round<br/>
trip)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails, funhog<br/>
