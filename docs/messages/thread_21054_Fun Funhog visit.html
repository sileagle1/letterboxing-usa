We were contacted by email Tuesday evening by Funhog saying she'd be in our <br/>
area Wednesday and we were able to hook up!! After stopping off at<br/>
In - N - Out for a burger (they don't have them in Portland, evidently) she <br/>
came to our house and we had a LOVELY visit! <br/>
<br/>
What a splendid individual! If you have found a Funhog box you know she's a <br/>
gem. But meeting her was even better! What a charming, happy lady! <br/>
Thanks for finding time for a visit, Funhog! <br/>
<br/>
'Til we meet again (hope it's soon!!)<br/>
