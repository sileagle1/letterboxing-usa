<br/>
I recently adopted several unclaimed boxes in NOVA.  Here's an update:<br/>
<br/>
Frying Pan Park:<br/>
The old box top was broken and the contents waterlogged.  I brought it <br/>
home, dried out the old log and cleaned up the stamp.  The wood was warped, <br/>
so I sanded what I could and reattached the image.  Good for now.  There's <br/>
a new box and log.<br/>
<br/>
The old location was a bit easy to stumble upon by innocents.  I moved it a <br/>
few feet back and hid it between two rocks.  Updated clues are on the web site.<br/>
<br/>
Purple People Eater:<br/>
Added a new companion box to Frying Pan Park.  See the website for new clues.<br/>
<br/>
Runway 17-35 (part of "A Day In Leesburg"):<br/>
This was reported MIA to me earlier this week.  It was where it should be, <br/>
but the recent rains all but buried it under dirt.  I had to dig to find it <br/>
:-)    Also, a large tree branch fell across the only way to get to it!  I <br/>
relocated the box to a much easier place to reach.  Clues on the web site.<br/>
<br/>
Ellanor C. Lawrence Park:<br/>
Both boxes were reported MIA.  Confirmed last week.  The original stamps <br/>
were store bought, and I couldn't find them at the local Michael's.  I <br/>
recarved the stamps from original stamp image I had in my log book.  The <br/>
first box is back where the old one was, but it is not exactly in the same <br/>
place: the tree root ball that was the home of the original box is no <br/>
more...forest workers chopped up the tree, leaving the site a little <br/>
different.  The new ECL#1 is there, but in a slightly different <br/>
location.  Clues are up on the web site.<br/>
<br/>
ECL#2 was located at Cabell's Mill just down the road.  The location was <br/>
reported as pretty obvious and not terribly difficult to stumble <br/>
across.  The new ECL#2 box has been relocated to the Visitor's Center, on <br/>
the North Loop Trail where ECL#1 is.<br/>
<br/>
This leaves Cabell's Mill (and the other half of the Visitor's Center area) <br/>
open for new boxes!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bump On A Log<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
The old box had a broken top and was waterlogged.  Cleaned up everything a <br/>
bit, and replaced in the same location with a new box.  Anyone going here: <br/>
please bring a large baggie...I didn't have any large bags when I replaced <br/>
the box, and it could use a couple!  Thanks!<br/>

We found ECL #2 last fall and were planning to finally hit ECL #1<br/>
tomorrow.  Now we'll have two boxes to find!<br/>

<br/>
If we get out there tomorrow we'll try to rebag it.  We were there<br/>
last week and noticed the broken lid, so we're glad you repaired it. <br/>
By the way, we were led to BOL last week by a toad hopping up into the<br/>
tree stump in question.<br/>
