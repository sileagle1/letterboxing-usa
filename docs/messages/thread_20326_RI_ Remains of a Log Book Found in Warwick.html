<br/>
I received an e-mail from a friend who said he found a letterbox <br/>
logbook while geocaching. The Logbook was not with its container and <br/>
may have "wash ashore." The book was found at the George B. Salter <br/>
Memorial Grove on Narragansett Parkway in Warwick, RI. It has a red <br/>
sequined cover. Just thought I'd post so people with boxes in the <br/>
area can check on them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
