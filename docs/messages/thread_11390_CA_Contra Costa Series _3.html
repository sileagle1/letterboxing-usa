                    <html><body><p>Location:  Briones Regional Park</p>
<p>City/State: Martinez-Pleasant Hill, CA</p>
<p>Difficulty: Easy - Made sure no rain for at least 24 hours.</p>
<p>Dogs: Okay on leash.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hwy 24 east to Lafayette</li>
<li>Pleasant Hill Rd. east exit </li>
<li>PH Rd turns into Taylor Blvd at split, bear left</li>
<li>Left at Grayson Rd (Signal at this intersection).</li>
<li>Right at 'T' - Reliez Valley Rd.</li>
<li>2 miles to Alhambra Creek Staging area - on weekends there is a $4.00 fee plus $1.00 per dog.  No fee during the week.</li>
<li>Take road to the end, which is the parking lot.</li>
<li>Go through gate.  There are maps in the box on the left, but this won't help you for our letterbox.  However, this a beautiful area to hike.</li>
<li>Follow fire road to right about 10 feet and on your left you will see a single track trail just to the left of the creek.  If you cross the creek you have gone too far.</li>
<li>This is the only uphill area, the rest if very level.</li>
<li>Continue on trail, you will cross a small tributary of the creek but main creek will continue to be on your right.</li>
<li>Continue to open meadow - take small trail to left.  There is a fenced area that was an agricultural project on the right side of the meadow.</li>
<li>Continue past the man made circles of branches (kind of strange) to the end of the meadow.</li>
<li>There is a larger tree on the right, this isn't the one.</li>
<li>Behind that tree there is a couple of trees that have low branches,  letterbox in the one slightly up the hill.</li></ul>
<p>Have fun and enjoy the birds and plants in this park.  Also, there is poison oak in this park so beware 'leaves of three, let them be'.  Thank you for letterboxing with us!</p>
