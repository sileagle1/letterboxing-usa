                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, as "planter" of the Mountain Laurel Alley" boxes in Voluntown how <br/>
embarrassed am I that the directions to the spot are wrong!!!  Melissa is <br/>
absolutely right- the turn out and the trail head are to the LEFT not to the <br/>
right...  I feel like a dweeb.  As for the trail closure to the RIGHT- that <br/>
part of the blue trail traipses through a hunting club (and opens out to the <br/>
white Baptist church on Rt 49 in N Stonington) and has been closed for some <br/>
time.<br/>
My sincerest apologies for all inconveniences this has caused and if the <br/>
powers that be could please amend the directions!  <br/>
