                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you Funhog for planting a box in this remote area of Maui. It <br/>
is a very interesting and beautiful area. <br/>
Sad to say, we never did find the box. First, we had a wonderful time <br/>
snorkeling at Ahihi cove,a marine reserve,that is located about a <br/>
mile before the parking spot. We then only made it to the wire fence. <br/>
Lizardbutt took one look at the King's Highway and said that he would <br/>
rather go "tidepool boxing" instead. We had a blast playing with the <br/>
hermit crabs and watching a school of dolphins swim around in the bay.<br/>
The kids did have fun walking over the a a lava beds.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Monica <br/>
