Metamora Mill.  I love the town, the history and your carvings are <br/>
terrific.  I'm so glad you lured me here.  I then went to The Cedar <br/>
Grove Baptist church.  a little creepy near dusk, but interesting.  <br/>
After that I booked it to Sunday drive and was able to find Mallard <br/>
and the covered bridge.  Could't find the one near the one near the <br/>
river, between my lame flashlight, people hanging around and total <br/>
darkness.  can't wait to go looking for more of your boxes the next <br/>
time I'm driving through.  You are a gifted carver.<br/>

Thanks - rtrw<br/>
