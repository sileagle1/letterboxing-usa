&gt;the whole way.  A stamp would be a great souvenir of our<br/>
&gt;journey...does anyone know of any boxes that are convenient (less<br/>
&gt;than 1 hour hike) to I-80?<br/>
<br/>
In NJ, these boxes are along the i-80 corridor and don't involve more than <br/>
an hour of hiking round-trip:<br/>
         Mount Hope; Mount Hope, NJ<br/>
         The Tourne; Boonton, NJ<br/>
There's a mystery box that's also very close to I-80.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, I placed a box in West Paterson, right off I-80, and I ought to <br/>
have the clues done in a week or two.<br/>
<br/>
When you get to the NJ-PA border , you'll drive right between the Mt. <br/>
Tammany (NJ) and Mt. Minsi (PA) boxes, but those involve a bit more of a <br/>
climb than you're probably looking for. The Delaware Water Gap box in <br/>
Blairstown, NJ, though, is about a one-hour hike RT.<br/>
<br/>
Then, just inside PA, my Pinebrook Park box is an easy one not too far from <br/>
Exit 307, then 10 minutes north on Route 191.<br/>
<br/>
In Illinois, check out the Lockport I&amp;M Canal Letterbox in Lockport (I've <br/>
not found this one, but was doing some planning last week for some upcoming <br/>
travel and marked it on a map, and I see it's close to I-80).<br/>
<br/>
In Nebraska, the Esperanto and Homing Pigeon Letterboxes are literally <br/>
adjacent to I-80. The park is an interesting place, and ought to help you <br/>
acclimate to Californians!  :-o<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is interesting to find out how many I have hidden close to I-80! I have boxes near Des Moines, IA, Omaha, <br/>
Lincoln, and Kearney, Nebraska. These towns, as well as Grand Island, all have boxes by a variety of other <br/>
stamp carvers, as well. Farther west, I have hidden boxes near Auburn and Nevada City, CA. <br/>
<br/>
It's a mighty long drive and a letterboxing hike will be just the thing to stretch your legs. I know you will be a <br/>
welcome addition to the burgeoning letterbox community in California. Hopefully, you will be adding boxes to <br/>
the meager number to found in many of the places along your path. Funhog<br/>

Depending on where in California you're moving you, you might miss <br/>
letterboxing completely!  =)<br/>
<br/>
At least until you populate your part of the state with boxes.<br/>

Please email me before you leave and I will send you clues to a new series<br/>
being planted in Lincoln,  NE just off I-80. My sister-in-law (she is not on<br/>
line) is planting a series of 7 called Sarah Plain &amp; Tall. She has 4 hidden<br/>
but they were dumped with snow and she waiting for a melt to hide the rest.<br/>
She is also working on a second series to be hidden in Lincoln, NE called<br/>
Saintly Symbols (I think)<br/>

Hi-Care; What you should do is drop down from I-80 in Youngstown to I-71 South to Columbus, Cincinnati, and then pick up I-74 West to Indiana and points West. That way you can do some of the best boxes West of the State of Connecticut. LOL<br/>
If you are interested, we can inform you further. Snowbird<br/>

You are in for a treat!!  I just found one in Green River, Wyoming <br/>
yesterday-l'il bugs bungalow....and then planted 2 more that will <br/>
take you less than an hour total (Ft Bridger, WY and Evanston, WY).  <br/>
I'll post them later this week.  All right!!!  I'm excited you'll <br/>
get them!!  You'll probably be the first!  =-)  <br/>
