                    <div class="plaintext-content"> It was great to see the Dispatch do such a huge article.  I have to admit<br/>
part of me likes to just tell people I know will be respectul of the land<br/>
and the boxes, but I sure hope we get more boxes planted here in town.  The<br/>
article featured Seeker of Flags as well as  Dog Scout Troop from Cinci. <br/>
 One of my concerns now is that some of the places we have boxes hidden will<br/>
use the clues to go out and remove them.  I can think of a few boxes here in<br/>
town that might concern folks, especially the ones at Inniswood and Park of<br/>
Roses.<br/>
I agree with the comment that no one seems to ever know what boxing is....<br/>
so my guess is that Karen(Seeker), must have a friend who writes for the<br/>
Dispatch :)<br/>
It's a beautiful day.......I should be out planting a box.  I have 3 or 4<br/>
stamps itchin' to be planted.<br/>

Hey Guru....I found the email address of the person who placed the <br/>
Whisper letterbox in Smithtown NY. I last corresponded with him in <br/>
January, 2001, so I can't guarantee the email address is still <br/>
valid. Send me another note at krl229@comcast.net and I'll send you <br/>
his email address.<br/>
<br/>
As I told you, I'd love to help you out with your event in my <br/>
hometown, but I'm hoping to be in RI at a soccer tournament that <br/>
weekend and am holding the day on my calendar for that.<br/>

Good luck spreading the word on LI.<br/>

Subject: Finally! and Welcome...<br/>
<br/>
After nine months of letterboxing in MI, IL, OH, PA, NJ and DE, I <br/>
have finally gotten an exchange! Actually two exchanges, two days in <br/>
a row!<br/>
<br/>
Sunday while at Saugatuck Dunes checking "Old Man Winter" and <br/>
placing "Spring Fling," I came upon an elderly woman standing alone <br/>
next the trail, looking anxiously from one side to the other. I <br/>
remembered passing her earlier on the trail and she had not been <br/>
alone. Since she happened to be standing at the precise spot where <br/>
one would enter the woods in pursuit of another letterbox at this <br/>
park, I glanced into the woods, and sure enough there was the rest of <br/>
her party stamping into the box! It was a first all-around, as Dave, <br/>
Lydia, Scott and Kristen (and guard Oma) were not only stamping into <br/>
the "First Letterbox on the Lake" (by Rainbow's End), but it was <br/>
their first ever letterbox find, and an exchange first for all of <br/>
us! So welcome to these newbies from West Michigan!<br/>
<br/>
Still on the high of actually meeting other letterboxers on the <br/>
trail, OldShoe and I set out on Monday for the "Beach View by the <br/>
Dunes," another Rainbow's End box, located at Warren Dunes State Park <br/>
in Sawyer, MI. After what must have been at least 3 miles of up and <br/>
down those dreadful Michigan sand dunes, we were nearing the end of <br/>
the clues, and passed a man and a woman looking for something in the <br/>
woods. The thought crossed our mind that they may be letterboxers, <br/>
but we continued on to the next landmark without saying anything and <br/>
found the box nestled in its hiding spot along the edge of the <br/>
beach. As we sat a little way down the beach stamping in, we saw the <br/>
man and woman we had passed earlier pointing to the steel pole and <br/>
making a bee-line for the box hiding spot! OldShoe went and asked <br/>
them if they were looking for the box... Sure enough! More <br/>
letterboxers! Turns out it was also their very first letterbox, and <br/>
I'm sorry that we had the box out and they didn't get that thrill of <br/>
seeing that first box hiding in its spot! But, it was nice to meet <br/>
more boxers... so welcome also to OldSoul and YoungHeart from <br/>
Chicago, IL.<br/>
<br/>
On Tuesday we headed over to pick up Matt the Rat's Chicago Portage <br/>
box, wondering if we could make it a sweep... We found the box, safe <br/>
and sound, but no other letterboxers at this one!<br/>
<br/>
Ahhh, there is finally a number behind that lonely little "X." Oh, <br/>
but Doug, you're not off the hook for that cup of coffee... the more <br/>
exchanges the merrier!<br/>

Deb - You can boost up your exchange number! It's not the number of <br/>
exchange incidents, it's the number of stamps. Sounds like you have <br/>

&gt;&gt; On Tuesday we headed over to pick up Matt the Rat's Chicago Portage <br/>
&gt;&gt; box, wondering if we could make it a sweep... We found the box, <br/>
&gt;safe <br/>
&gt;&gt; and sound, but no other letterboxers at this one!<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Ahhh, there is finally a number behind that lonely little "X." Oh, <br/>
&gt;&gt; but Doug, you're not off the hook for that cup of coffee... the <br/>
&gt;more <br/>
&gt;&gt; exchanges the merrier!<br/>

Actually, since they were new, they didn't all have their own stamps <br/>

Subject: Stats and confusion<br/>
<br/>
Hey there! I'm rather new to the list and have been seeing folks <br/>
sign thier messages with a list of stats. I'm sure this has been <br/>
asked and answered a villion times before, but this is a busy list, <br/>
and searching back through the archives can be a bit daunting. Any <br/>
help?<br/>
P = boxes planted, <br/>
F = boxes found, <br/>
X = stamps exchanged with other boxers ...<br/>
<br/>
But what are some of the rest of them? <br/>
V = taking a guess that this is Virgins found? (first finds?)<br/>
E = <br/>
R =<br/>
SS =<br/>
L = <br/>
C = <br/>
HH = Hitchhikers found (I've only seen one person -so far- with this <br/>
stat listed. I'm guessing this one isn't commonly used. <br/>
<br/>
Here's a sig line that stumped me completely:<br/>
Psychomommy and Princess Turtle<br/>
P23 F97 X60 V3 E4 C0 R1 SS1 L8<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help!<br/>

<br/>
Welcome! It's great to see another So. Cal. boxer!<br/>
<br/>
I have seen a lot of people on trails with baby backpacks. They are worn<br/>
like a regular backpack but have a seat to put your kidlet in. The kids seem<br/>
to like it since most of them I have seen have been rocked to sleep by the<br/>
walking motion.<br/>
<br/>
There are also some boxes that are easier to find because they are in more <br/>
civilized' locations. I recommend the Descanso Garden series and the El<br/>
Dorado Park series. Both of those are on pretty tame terrain with no steep<br/>
climbs (the one exception might be the Chaparral Trail in Descanso but that<br/>
one isn't terribly bad either).<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking of ways to plant some boxes in more urban (or suburban)<br/>
areas. I bought a bunch of really strong magnets and am going to start<br/>
experimenting with them. My only worry is that, in the post 9-11 environment<br/>
 someone might be a little freaked by seeing someone placing a black box<br/>
behind a payphone, power box, bus stop, etc. and call the police.<br/>

I learned a few things: even with two adults, steep inclines are <br/>
hard to manage with a 15 month old in a BabyBjorn. Anyone have <br/>
little ones (we've another on the way) and have advice in this area? <br/>
Is it best to simply stick to the easiest boxes? Or is there another <br/>
way to transport kids more efficiently? Also, we got lost once (we <br/>
took a side trail to be the "split" in the trail, and scaled a very <br/>
steep hill up and down, before realizing we had gone wrong.)<br/>

This box is located in Shenandoah County Virginia near Woodstock, <br/>

Palm Sunday April 13th in honor of the birth of a new baby in our <br/>
circle of friends. We hope you enjoy the Woodstock Tower. This is <br/>
our first placed box and we are nervous and excited! The link to the <br/>

If you make the trip to Sandy Point for this new box, head over the Bay<br/>
Bridge for some of the Forest Frog Eastern Shore boxes! We placed 6 boxes -<br/>
2 each in 3 different locations (Tuckahoe State Park and Wye Island NRMA are<br/>
not too far over the Bridge, Eastern Neck Wildlife Refuge is a bit more of a<br/>
drive, but worth the trip!) Sorry for the shameless plug...we just had a<br/>
whole lot of fun placing these last November, and the area is beautiful.<br/>

This is a good one to stop at if you are headed to the Shore or the<br/>
Northeast via the Bay Bridge, for a quick rest. The park is located at the<br/>
exit off of US 50/301 just east of the Bay Bridge Toll Plaza.<br/>
<br/>
You will need to pay $1 gate fee to enter the park with exact change-it is<br/>
an automated toll machine! If you try to park outside the gate and walk in,<br/>
the park ranger will make you move your car, as he did for me!<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you go into the park to the beaches to check out the views of the<br/>
Bay Bridge. I tried to hide the box within view of the bay, but there were<br/>
no good hiding spots!<br/>
<br/>
Immediately after paying the fee, there are about 5 parking spaces to your<br/>
right. Try to park here. If not possible, park in one of the lots further<br/>
into the park and walk back to the tollgate area.<br/>
