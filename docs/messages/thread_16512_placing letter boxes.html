Please know that you can also have this book or any book ordered for <br/>
you at your local independent bookseller.  Mine should be in today, I <br/>
am told.  Sorry for this off topic interjection, but if we give all <br/>
of our book business to large scale companies, eventually presses <br/>
that will publish books for relatively small groups like letterboxers <br/>
will also disappear.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am always in favor of getting approval from the managers of <br/>
property before planting boxes.  I like to get them enthused about <br/>
the hobby and get them involved.  In one case, other boxers have <br/>
planted on property owned by an organization I am involved with.  <br/>
They are disappointed that their permission was not sought before <br/>
hand.  I will attempt to develop a friendly relationship between <br/>
owners and planters to smooth things over.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of state parks (Connecticut) there are few managers on <br/>
staff to monotor all the parks, and relationships between staff and <br/>
visitors are not possible.  The state has planted "official" boxes, <br/>
so there is no doubt that they are in favor of the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of town parks or nature centers that have staff on site <br/>
or volunteers that manage the area, I think a friendly relationship <br/>
between manager and box planter is essential.  It can give our hobby <br/>
a better face and promote the activity.  Many nature centers have <br/>
taken letterboxing to heart and encorporated it into their nature <br/>
programs.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that our hobby depends entirely on land where we are just <br/>
visitors.<br/>
