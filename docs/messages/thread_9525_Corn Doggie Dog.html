With lots of brown mustard and saurkraut?  Add a mug of beer <br/>
and you've got a great meal!<br/>

Cory was the spelunker in Oregon.  He didnt have a stamp at <br/>
that time.  Since we only placed boxes and did no hunting that <br/>
trip he didnt really need one then.  Speaking of the Lava River <br/>
Cave Letterbox, no one has reported having been to that box as <br/>
of yet.  Funhog was nearby and visited 2 of our other boxes but <br/>
feared to venture into the cave alone.  I guess early hibernating <br/>
bears like ham and bacon too much.  <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, SOMEONE will take the plunge soon.  I would hate to <br/>
go back there next spring to find an empty log book.  Hint Hint, <br/>
Nudge Nudge...<br/>

I know a quick solution to that problem.  Don't go back to check the <br/>
logbook.  *hint hint*  *nudge nudge*  =)<br/>

One of the wonderful things about hiding boxes in out of the way, <br/>
inaccessible locations is that there's never little maintenence to do <br/>
with them!  You don't get lots of false alarms from people who can't <br/>
find the box and think it might be missing.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, for those who like caves, I hid one of my letterboxes in <br/>
a cave.  It's a mystery box, though, so you've got to figure it out <br/>
first.  I don't actually SAY in the clue that it's in a cave.  ;o)<br/>
