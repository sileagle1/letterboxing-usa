I tried to contact the Public Gardens Manager at Inniswood (Ms. <br/>
Steelman) to discuss our pastime and come to some agreement as to <br/>
how we can continue our activities at Inniswood without "disturbing" <br/>
the management/rangers at Inniswood.  I stopped by Inniswood on <br/>
Tuesday (and left a message with a staffer) and left a phone message <br/>
Wednesday (4/24).  So far I have had no response from Ms. Steelman <br/>
and a very bitter reaction from a staffer at the park.  From what I <br/>
understand, some geocachers did a bit of damage either trying to <br/>
locate or plant (literally) a geocache.  The staffer I spoke with <br/>
does not understand (or does not want to understand) that what <br/>
occurred in Inniswood is not the norm (for either letterboxers or <br/>
geocachers) and did not seem interested in the slightest about <br/>
dealing with us at all.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, perhaps on to the Metro Parks Director (although I was <br/>
trying to keep the issue as "local" and as far from the bureacracy <br/>
as possible).<br/>
