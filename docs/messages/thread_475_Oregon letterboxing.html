I think BRAVO for a single man, BRAVA for a woman, BRAVE for several <br/>
women, and BRAVI for several men or mixed company.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  folks realizing that we should, really, (b)e talking about lett'r'box'n!<br/>

&gt; &gt;  So, to all you you, BRAVE!  I am inspired<br/>

&gt; I seem to have an even greater number of typos these days. Was it to be<br/>

&gt; perhaps both apply?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great news, Thom! Maybe you had a searcher find your box in the <br/>
rain, take it home to stamp with the intention of bringing it <br/>
back soon. When time slipped away, he or she shamefacedly decided <br/>
not to stamp the journal (or removed the telltale page) and <br/>
returned it. Who knows. Very glad to hear it's back in place <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Rock Creek sounds like a delightful spot to visit and getting <br/>
better all the time. Wish it were closer.<br/>

&gt; I went out in Cara's wake to see what she left in my letterboxes at Rock<br/>
&gt; Creek.  I should inform you all that Rock Creek #1.. the original box<br/>
&gt; that had been misappropriated has been returned!!  I was in the act of<br/>
&gt; placing the replacement box &amp; saw it very near the original location<br/>
&gt; (not getting too specific about that location).  I did a double take &amp;<br/>
&gt; wondered for a mintute if I had just overlooked it.  Upon closer<br/>
&gt; inspection I found that the contents were intact, but all removed from<br/>
&gt; the ziplock baggie.  The notebook was still usable &amp; still has Mitch's &amp;<br/>
&gt; Dan'l's stamps and remarks.  I added the new stamp I carved for the<br/>
&gt; replacement (bringing the total stamps included in that box to 3).  At<br/>
&gt; some point I will divide them up &amp; give them their own boxes.  We have a<br/>
&gt; nice wildlife theme going in the neighborhood.  You can collect a<br/>
&gt; raccoon (compliments of Mitch), opposum, canadian goose, little brown<br/>
&gt; bat, great blue heron &amp; now an otter for your trouble.  All local<br/>
&gt; inhabitants of our little 5 aker wood &amp; vicinity.  Not to mention the<br/>
&gt; troll &amp; dragon downstream (also compliments of Mitch).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So... Rock Creek #1 is back in business... sporting some lovely purple<br/>
&gt; stampage by Cara (thanks Cara... I went to check on the "Possum's<br/>
&gt; Penthouse" after reading that you didn't find it... it awaits your<br/>
&gt; return!!).  The woods are leafing out, the trillium are about done<br/>
&gt; blooming, but some blue lily-looking flowers are popping up all over. <br/>
&gt; Starting to heavily scout for new hiding spots... something a little<br/>
&gt; tougher.... hmmmmm....<br/>
