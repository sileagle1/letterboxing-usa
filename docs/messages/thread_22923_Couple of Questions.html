<br/>
I am new to Letterboxing, but I have been Geocaching for several years <br/>
now.  I noticed that in my area, there are only two letter boxes (the <br/>
only two in my county), but there are over a hundred Geocaches.  I <br/>
asked the owner of the letterboxes if he would be willing to let me <br/>
add his boxes to the Geocaching website to attract more hits and to <br/>
combine the two past-times.  He did not want to do this as he has had <br/>
problems with Geocachers taking his stamp despite his messages of <br/>
leaving the stamp.  So I would like to know if many letterbox owners <br/>
have experienced this?<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to know if it is common to leave an ink pad in the <br/>
letterbox.  I would think not because of the risk of freezing, but it <br/>
never hurts to ask.<br/>

 We have had geocachers put their cache on top of our letterbox(in <br/>
the middle of the forest), use our seven box series as way points, <br/>
and have lost stamps to geocachers. Unfortunately this has biased <br/>
our view of geocaching. Combining the two just doesn't work!<br/>

I do the same thing the geocachers around here do when they stumble on one of <br/>
my letterboxes.   I sign the log (I just go ahead and stamp in.   Might as <br/>
well share my signature stamp with everyone!) and leave a note that I found it <br/>
while letterboxing.<br/>

Well, that was COMPLETELY arrogant and unethical on the part of the geocacher!  You <br/>
would be completely justified in reporting this to Groundspeak (geocaching.com).   <br/>
<br/>
We are active in both boxing and caching and can say that the majority of cachers are <br/>
responsible and considerate and just like to get outdoors and 'go hunting', just with high-<br/>
tech toys instead of clues! <br/>

directional hints, and since the accuracy of most consumer-level  GPS (Global Positioning <br/>

therefore often happens that in the search process they find a LB.  <br/>

 It is discouraging to hear so many negative episodes.   There have also been a few <br/>

This has happened to me twice. Both times the geocacher was there first and<br/>
when I heard from a letterboxer that they found a geocache nearby I<br/>
contacted the cacher and offered to relocate my box. In both cases they said<br/>
don't bother and added a note about the letterbox on their geocache listing.<br/>
I haven't had any problems with either box. Of course, different people<br/>
react differently.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can think of a specific instance in southern Connecticut where the stamp <br/>
was removed by geocachers and replaced with a baggie of crayons.  I used the <br/>
crayons to draw in the image of the stamp that would hvae been there.  Others <br/>
wrote in the logbook that they managed to locate the geocache and looked in it <br/>
for the stamp, but it wasn't there.  :(<br/>
<br/>
I also heard a rumor of that happening last winter to a box in Glastonbury <br/>
but I don't know if that's true or if I'm remembering incorrectly...  <br/>
<br/>
I think that as long as the stamp is clearly labeled that it's NOT to leave <br/>
the box, you'll probably be OK...<br/>
<br/>
I personally wouldn't mind if there was a geocache near my box.  No big deal <br/>
to me.  :)  As long as my stamp and ink stayed put.  :)<br/>
<br/>
And yes, a lot of people leave ink and pens in the boxes even in the winter.  <br/>
I've never seen it freeze, but the pens don't work very well in the cold.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Welcome!   Team Bear-Cat (husband and wife team)<br/>
&gt; have been caching for 3<br/>
&gt; years and<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxing for about 1 year and   enjoy both very<br/>
&gt; much.  We have several<br/>
&gt; letterbox-hybrid<br/>
&gt; &gt; geocaches as well as several 'pure' letterboxes<br/>
&gt; and so far have had no<br/>
&gt; problems.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; carefully label the stamp as 'Not a Trade Item'<br/>
&gt; and usually have two<br/>
&gt; different logbooks<br/>
&gt; &gt; (one ruled, one blank for stamps) in the hybrids.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For what it is worth, the general geocaching<br/>
&gt; guidelines require that<br/>
&gt; containers be at least<br/>
&gt; &gt; 520' from any other cache or similar container. <br/>
&gt; Some cachers have<br/>
&gt; complained that<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxers don't follow such guidelines well and<br/>
&gt; often place a LB within<br/>
&gt; 50' or less of a<br/>
&gt; &gt; previously-placed cache.  Since geocachers are<br/>
&gt; searching for coordinates<br/>
&gt; instead of<br/>
&gt; &gt; directional hints, and since the accuracy of most<br/>
&gt; consumer-level  GPS<br/>
&gt; (Global Positioning<br/>
&gt; &gt; Satellite) devices is not more than 20-30' at best<br/>
&gt; (less under heavy tree<br/>
&gt; cover...), it<br/>
&gt; &gt; therefore often happens that in the search process<br/>
&gt; they find a LB.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  It is discouraging to hear so many negative<br/>
&gt; episodes.   There have also<br/>
&gt; been a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; comments noted on caching forums that letterboxers<br/>
&gt; have  moved the cache<br/>
&gt; container or<br/>
&gt; &gt; otherwise 'interfered'.  But all in all I would<br/>
&gt; say that generally both<br/>
&gt; groups are honorable<br/>
&gt; &gt; and simply sign or stamp in the log book and leave<br/>
&gt; it otherwise<br/>
&gt; undisturbed.   'It's all<br/>
&gt; &gt; about the hunt!'<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am new to Letterboxing, but I have been<br/>
&gt; Geocaching for several years<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; now.  I noticed that in my area, there are only<br/>
&gt; two letter boxes (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; only two in my county), but there are over a<br/>
&gt; hundred Geocaches.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; asked the owner of the letterboxes if he would<br/>
&gt; be willing to let me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; add his boxes to the Geocaching website to<br/>
&gt; attract more hits and to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; combine the two past-times.  He did not want to<br/>
&gt; do this as he has had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; problems with Geocachers taking his stamp<br/>
&gt; despite his messages of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; leaving the stamp.  So I would like to know if<br/>
&gt; many letterbox owners<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have experienced this?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would also like to know if it is common to<br/>
&gt; leave an ink pad in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterbox.  I would think not because of the<br/>
&gt; risk of freezing, but it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; never hurts to ask.<br/>

That's true... TWICE!!!  My Glastonbury Lady #2 was taken, and a note from "Sea Girl" was left in it's place thanking me for the stamp with a small piece of sea glass.<br/>
  I replaced the stamp, but it disappeared within a week.  Wild Rover's Glastonbury Lady #1 is safe and sound however!  If I recarve and replace, it WILL be in a different spot within Green Cemetery. (Grrrr, I loved that cedar grove!)   MayEve<br/>
