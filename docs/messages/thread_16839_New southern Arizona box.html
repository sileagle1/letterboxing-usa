<br/>
Anza Trail Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Azroadie<br/>
Placement date: November  13, 2003<br/>
State:  Arizona<br/>
County:   Santa Cruz<br/>
Nearest town:  Tubac<br/>
Difficulty:   Walk  easy.  Clues  easy<br/>
Walking time:  about  26 minutes one way.<br/>
<br/>
Box is along the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail between<br/>
Tubac and Tumacacori.  From I-10 take I-19 south.  Take exit #34 to<br/>
Tubac.  Follow signs to Tubac Presidio State Historic Park.  Just<br/>
before entering the Park's parking lot, turn south to Anza Trailhead<br/>
parking.  <br/>
<br/>
Walk generally south on the Anza Trail.  You will go through a large<br/>
barren field.  You will then walk past a bunch of bat boxes.  You will<br/>
then pass through a narrow tree covered portion of the trail.  You<br/>
will then see on the east side an athletic field and playground.  You<br/>
will then come to a fence line corner with a large wood corner post. <br/>
At the third white trail marker after that, go off trail at about 80<br/>
degrees for about 28 paces to a large nearly dead tree.  The box is at<br/>
the base on its west side under chunks of wood.   Be alert for snakes<br/>
and scorpions.  This is a great birding area.<br/>
<br/>
Contact me if the box needs attention:  <br/>
