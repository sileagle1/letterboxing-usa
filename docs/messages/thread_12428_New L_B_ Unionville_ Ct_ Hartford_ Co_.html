Two of the stamps carved by rtrw (how cool is this, to hunt for your own<br/>
carvings :-)<br/>
Very easy walk around a small neat park overlooking beautiful downtown<br/>
Unionville (I know... I know, it's really Farmington)<br/>
<br/>
Driving west on Rt.4 take a right onto Park Pond Pl. after Rt. 167 and<br/>
the Citgo station. Park out of the way as much as possible, this is a<br/>
street. Walk in at the Suburban Park sign, going up a little hill, at the<br/>
top will be a log with a stone on top where you'll be coming out on the<br/>
way back. At the bottom of the downhill will be a faint path on the left<br/>
and as you take it, keep a sharp lookout (right away) to the left for an<br/>
old foundation. I'm assuming that this was once a silo. When sitting on<br/>
the part where a few stones are missing and siting 200 degrees you can<br/>
spot the log where the Suburban Silo letterbox hides 7 steps up it's west<br/>
side.<br/>
Go back to the main trail (none of these are marked). At the top of the<br/>
next uphill if you go straight and then down, there is a playground for<br/>
the child with (or within) you, however we need to go left, staying<br/>
straight on this path past a hole in the ground with steps ( a root<br/>
cellar?) until you see V shaped benches overlooking a brook. Standing in<br/>
the V, site 80 degrees to find the stump the Suburban Tree letterbox<br/>
lurks behind.<br/>
