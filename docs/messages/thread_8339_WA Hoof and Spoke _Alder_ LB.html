                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just returned from Hoof and Spokes new LB ( posted yesterday)  I <br/>
must say Bravo for a beautiful hike and a great stamp.<br/>
<br/>
The time frame references they posted are for horseback.  How I envy <br/>
them their ability to LB from horseback .  I hike briskly so was able <br/>
to cover the whole trip in 2.5 hours.  Add about 5 minutes to the <br/>
first reference and about 3 - 5 minutes to the other references. ( <br/>
except the last one) BTW hoofandspoke, my Bridle Trails SP series is <br/>
very pony friendly, even for a show ring powder puff.<br/>
<br/>
The clues are very correct and clearly the time points are not going <br/>
to make too much difference.  I would not recommend this LB for a <br/>
newbie who does not have experience navigating from written <br/>
directions in a somewhat "wilderness" situation.  This venue is <br/>
fairly isolated and you are unlikely to meet up with folks.  There <br/>
are signs at trail junctions which one should always note in case of <br/>
orientation problems.<br/>
<br/>
The Wooley Bear Caterpillars are on the march and I encountered them <br/>
by the dozens on the last road out. <br/>
<br/>
Truly a sign of Fall here.<br/>
