                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with Deborah.  Her sentence is short and to the point.  It need not <br/>
be so prominent as to "scare" anyone away.  (If someone is actually that <br/>
timid, I can't imagine them having the "courage" to go out and letterbox!)  <br/>
And I also agree that there has been a large amount of discussion on this <br/>
issue.  However, if you find it boring, skip it!  Personally, I find the <br/>
discussions about carving tools and the merits of various erasers boring.  <br/>
So I simply skim those messages and move on to the next.<br/>
<br/>
Randy made a good suggestion and asked for feedback.  A number of us gave <br/>
feedback, with the majority saying that a statement re copyright should go <br/>
on our page.  If a sentence had been added at that time, the so-called <br/>
boring discussion would have ended there.  But instead the majority were <br/>
opposed with well-meaning but lengthy arguments from the list manager.<br/>
<br/>
That's the way it goes sometimes on this list. It's like the weather in New <br/>
England:  If you don't like it, wait a minute!<br/>
