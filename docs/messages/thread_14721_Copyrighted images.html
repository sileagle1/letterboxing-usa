I was just about to start carving a series of boxes based off of one of my favorite movies, but before I did, I wanted to ask you all how much you take copyright laws into consideration when carving.  I know this sport isn't for any sort of profit, and aside from the occasional park entry fee, there's no money exchanged, but how much do you worry about copyrights?<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I would rather not have the interpol police (or whoever it is that sponsors that scary red screen at the start of all my movies) busting down my door and waking the baby.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully not inspiring paranoia,<br/>

I don't think you need to worry about voilating any copyright laws<br/>
when you make a stamp since it's for (essentially) private use.  If<br/>
you were to make an image and then use that image on note cards,<br/>
T-shirts, or watches, or anything that you sell or somehow make a<br/>
profit from, then you might have a problem.  If you were to take<br/>
someone elses image and take credit for it, then there would be a<br/>
copyright problem. For example, if I were to say "I made this drawing<br/>
of Gregory Peck from my "memory" when it is obviously from a movie<br/>
photo, then I would be violating the law. Now if I were to say I made<br/>
the drawing from a particular photo in honor of Gregory Peck because<br/>
he was one of my favorite actors, well then that is different.  <br/>
