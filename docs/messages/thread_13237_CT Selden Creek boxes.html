What a magnificent spot!! Thanks to Drewclan.  The second box's log <br/>
looked as though it had been wet at some point, but it was all snug <br/>
in a new bag.  The bonus of the day was finding the Black Bear Paw HH <br/>
which originated on the west coast.  Who knows where it will walk off <br/>
to next........I even made it back home b4 the rain started-YAY--<br/>
Sunshine :0) <br/>
