                    <div class="plaintext-content">We decided to celebrate the great weather by trying for Moonstone Baby's new<br/>
series - Signs of Life.  We were heading for the first box when we saw 3 people<br/>
on horseback on the far side of the field.  Then we saw Laurette and the rest<br/>
of the Vitelle family.  As we were walking to join up we saw one of the horse<br/>
return without a rider, then another on horseback chasing the loose horse.  We<br/>
were enjoying the spectacle when up strolled Churchill!  Everyone must have had<br/>
the same idea today.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, great stamps, nice areas.  BTW, we stopped at Asa Pond boxes on the way<br/>
home.  The bog bridges are so much fun I had a hard time getting my kids to<br/>
finish the hike.  Now is definitely the time to do them before the bugs make it<br/>
unbearable.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Janet and Laurette for great stamps and great fun!<br/>

I'm glad my boxes provided so much entertainment.  A run away horse <br/>
wasn't exactly what I had in mind for "a wildlife sighting" but I <br/>
guess it works LOL.  So many people in my back yard and I was over in <br/>
North Stonington with Mary RI &amp; Betz letterboxing.  We had a great <br/>
day too.  We did the 4 boxes at Little Dam and the 3 at Yarbux <br/>
Valley.   To think I lived for 14 yrs off Ryder Rd just a mile from <br/>
the Yarbux Valley hike and never even knew that trail was there.  It <br/>
was a real nice hike &amp; a beautiful day.  <br/>
