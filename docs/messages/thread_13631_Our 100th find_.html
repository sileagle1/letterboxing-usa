                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went out with the Drewclan, Butterfly, and Patrick with Ruth <br/>
(minus Amy), and we placed a few more boxes along a not-yet-released <br/>
series in Waterford, CT. Over the course of various suprises and <br/>
plants by the others, I managed to get # 100. Unfortunatley Heidi <br/>
was not able to make it out with us, but she was not to disappointed <br/>
once I showed her some of the beautiful creations of Mr. Drew that <br/>
just happened to find their way in the log!<br/>
<br/>
We're just shy of 8 months into letterboxing, with our first stamps <br/>
dating back to Kids Day on October 20th, 2002.   Glad we got into <br/>
the hobby!<br/>
<br/>
By the way... in the neatest of happenings, the 100th box is <br/>
called "Friends". Carved by Butterfly. What better company to find <br/>
100 with than a group of friends, at the box called friends, in the <br/>
company of such legends as Jay and B'Fly....not to mention Patrick, <br/>
who got me hooked (and for the record, Patrick and Amy are in the <br/>
400's for finds...)!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all, it was a great morning!!!!<br/>
