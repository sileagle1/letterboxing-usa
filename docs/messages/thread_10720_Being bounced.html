Sometimes, your ISP's mail server may slow down or stop temporarily. It <br/>
might be overloaded, or your ISP may have rebooted the server, or it may <br/>
have crashed. When that happens, the server that's trying to send email to <br/>
your ISP will not be able to get through to your account. However, the <br/>
people who created the Internet's mail protocols knew that sometimes <br/>
servers would have trouble communicating on a temporary basis, so they <br/>
designed the system in such a manner that the server sending email will <br/>
automatically try again later, and then again and again for the next couple <br/>
of days until it is (hopefully) finally able to get through. When this <br/>
happens, it's called a "soft bounce." A "hard bounce" is what happens when <br/>
the email address is nonexistent.<br/>
<br/>
Now, when the mail server for Yahoo! Groups gets too many soft bounces for <br/>
a user, they suspend that email address so that they don't waste too many <br/>
computer resources in trying to resend the message over and over again. <br/>
Soft bounces are not uncommon -- they happen every day. On one Internet <br/>
discussion list with which I'm involved, there are 4,000 subscribers, and <br/>
traffic can be 75-100 messages a day. For any particular message that's <br/>
posted to the list, several hundred email addresses may generate transient <br/>
errors. Most users never even know about it -- at least until their account <br/>
is suspended for having too many soft bounces. If you get the LBNA list by <br/>
email, you can check your own ISP's bounce history at the Yahoo! Groups <br/>
site by clicking the "Bounce History" link.<br/>
