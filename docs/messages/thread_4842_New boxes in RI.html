                    <div class="plaintext-content">Made some good use of our first weekend back in RI.  Besides enjoying <br/>
RI's new "most boxious" series and partaking of the usual Easter <br/>
traditions from my childhood (including leaving a drawing and recipe <br/>
for "strange Easter soup" at one of CT's newest mysteries!),we managed <br/>
to put back most of the vandalized  Burlingame area boxes plus several <br/>
new ones as well!  Thanks again to everyone who offered to help with <br/>
the clean-up - it was really appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
As for the new boxes, first up is a sort of post-graduate certificate <br/>
to "Dancing Men", called "The Pine Barrens of RI" (inspired by Cowboy <br/>
and Leader of the Pack - Timmy and Carolyn - for taking a different <br/>
route and almost finding them by accident!) Second is another RI <br/>
mystery called "Going Downhill",also to be posted sometime soon.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Carolyn Stearns has graciously donated to us her adorable <br/>
"Lil' Rhodster" stamp from the Burlingame Fall Gathering for use as a <br/>
home box stamp!  So, for anyone who missed that event or who just <br/>
wants to take a "little Rhode" trip, all you have to do is figure out <br/>
where we live and come visit! The tricky part, however, will be <br/>
catching us at home, since we're so frequently off working, hiking, <br/>
skiing, dancing, or even occasionally letterboxing! If you call or <br/>
e-mail ahead, though, we just might be able to arrange something!<br/>
<br/>
Happy spring letterboxing!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">thank you Wanda &amp; Pete for putting your Burlingame boxes back out. I <br/>
love those trails &amp; they are so close to home.<br/>
<br/>
gee, you already did the Hills are Alive ... I thought I might <br/>
actually do a letterbox before you two but I guess not LOL<br/>
<br/>
happy trails,<br/>
