The tyson 1 letterbox (formally a geocache) is also doing fine but has not had any visitors except me.<br/>
<br/>
Mohmers<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS  Having few visitors is a good thing since , like Rockwoods, Tyson prefers to keep off trail use down.<br/>
<br/>
I had a note from a geocacher that the Rockwoods rangers were going to remove my son's (SpaceDAW)
 Rockwood Reservation letterbox because they prefer people stay off the trails  .... when we were there on Wednesday the Ranger said off trail activity was fine as long as you were careful not to STOMP delicate flowers.   When we visited the box it was very obvious that the rangers had checked it out ... it was placed next to its hiding spot with several small stones neatly stacked on top of it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope someone visits it soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Mohmers</body></html>
