<p>Be is a serious student.<span>  </span>If he wants to learn about something, he studies it.<span>  </span>And, if he wants to be something someday  he practices  a lot!<span>  </span>So, keeping in mind his future desire to be the A#1 video game designer for Nintendo, the hours he spends on his Gameboy Advance and glued to the controllers of the Game Cube are commendable, even maturely ambitious</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Bes current gaming favorite is Mario.<span>  </span>Mario is a character that many of us slightly older folks will remember wistfully as a compatriot of Mr. And Ms. Pac Man et. al. 1980s generation of arcade games, Donkey Kong.<span>  </span>Well, since then, Mario has ditched the ape and gathered a new set of friends including a flying dinosaur named Yoshi.<span>  </span>In this, his latest adventure, our hero seeks to rescue the fair Peach, Princess Toadstool of the Mushroom Kingdom (she prefers the nickname Peach, and can you blame her?!)<span>  </span>Princess Peach is being held in the clutches of the EVIL Bowser!!!<span>  </span>(booooooo, hisssss).<span>   </span>If you follow the directions carefully and avoid all enemies  you will succeed!<span>  </span>So load up your fire-flower, FLUDD (water canon), Starman (invincibility) and may the force be with you (ooooops  wrong adventure!)</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Park your Mario Kart in the Glyndon Park lot off of Beulah Rd.<span>  </span>(not far from Maple Avenue in Vienna).<span>  </span>Hop on Yoshi (your fluttering dinosaur) and follow the paved path into the woods.<span>  </span>Yoshi says (in Yoshi language) that hes going to eat a lot of enemies and leave a lot of eggs in his wake (apparently after he eats the enemies, he digests them and, well, they come out the other end as eggs [cooooool!]) Pass a suspicious structure on the right.<span>  </span>Could it be the hiding place of some electric Koopas?!!<span>  </span>Nah  its just a power generator.<span>  </span>Continue through the trees passing a very low and freshly shorn stump on the right.<span>  </span>Was it the victim of a Hammering Brother?!!<span>  </span>Yoshi is on high alert!<span>  </span>Flutter on past the playground on the right where you can spy a red and yellow Kart.<span>  </span>Perhaps they are the abandoned vehicles of super heroes who had sought to help the fair Peach  and failed!!<span>  </span>(da, da, da, daaaaaaa) You are the only hope now! </p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>You contemplate seeking shelter by the picnic tables on the left and right but decide to press on.<span>  </span>This is no time to have lunch!<span>  </span>Bear left on the path as you head down hill.<span>  </span>At the bottom, in front of a building, you spy a water fountain.<span>  </span>You fill up FLUDD (your water canon) and take the path to the right, on the look out for spikes.<span>  </span>Luckily, the only spikes you see are the ones on the shoes of the baseball players as you head past the field on the left.<span>  </span>You come to the top of a hill and survey the land.<span>  </span>Below you see a familiar Mario mini-game sight  a basketball court.<span>  </span>Although it is not an official Mario sport, such as tennis or racing, you head on down to the court anyway.<span>  </span>Continue past the big green wall, stopping perhaps to spray off the graffiti that mars its surface.<span>   </span>At the end of the court, peer off into the woods and you will see a little path and a bridge.<span>  </span>Approach the bridge, but do not cross!<span>  </span>Instead, peer to the northeast and find a funny stump that kind of looks like a spiky fence post.<span>  </span>Next to that post, on the left, is a whole, live tree (with some pretty green ivy  even in the winter time).<span>  </span>At the base of this tree, under lots and lots of sticks, awaits our precious Peach.<span>  </span>She leans in to give you a big kiss for rescuing her (eeeewwww!) you request an image of her instead to keep forever by your heart.<span>  </span>Well done our hero!<span>  </span>You have defeated Bowser.<span>  </span>Mama Mia, you realize, its late and your brother Luigi is waiting for you at the pizza parlor!<span>  </span>Hi Yo Yoshi (ooooops -- wrong hero).<span>  </span>Off you ride into the sunset.<span>  </span>TO BE CONTINUED</p>
