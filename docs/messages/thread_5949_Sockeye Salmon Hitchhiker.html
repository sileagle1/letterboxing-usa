I would be happy to double check the BTSP box and see if the salmon<br/>
was there and on what day.  Perhaps there is a name before and after<br/>
you can connect to.  I visited on June 23 and the woman who placed<br/>

 &gt; I have a request:<br/>
 &gt; Somehow, my Sockeye Salmon Hitchhiker has been separated into two<br/>

thought the<br/>
 &gt; stamp was hiding in Bridle Trails, Washington.  But we don't think<br/>
it's<br/>
 &gt; there<br/>

Yes, we were the ones who found the Sockeye Salmon hitcher, all alone <br/>
in its bag without a logbook, on May 27th at Snoqualmie Falls #3, and <br/>
left it the next day with a little temporary logbook at Bridle Trails <br/>
near Seattle. Hope its well on its way by now!!!<br/>
