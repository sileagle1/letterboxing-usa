It did get there. There is also a HH that was sent from Oregon with the destination of getting to my dog Molly, here in CT. It is supposed to be pretty close now. A specific route would be a little more difficult to maintain but why not try it. It may or may not work. I would say it's worth trying...Chuck and Molly<br/>

I created a HH last year called "The Homesick Moose".<br/>
Originally, I was going to plant it at a state park in<br/>
Maine, but the rangers asked me not too, so I ended up<br/>
bringing it back to MA, and turning it into a HH with<br/>
the goal of making it home to ME. Last I heard, he'd<br/>
made it home briefly before taking off on adventures<br/>
elsewhere....<br/>

As for where to put it I always try to put HHs in a high traffic area to keep them moving. It depends on the HH as to where I decide to place it. If it has been stuck in one area or state for quite a while I try to give it a boost and hide it a distance from where I found it but if it hasn't been moved  much I just try to get it back out there ASAP!  <br/>
<br/>
Now I know others feel you should earn HHs and only hide them in challenging boxes. <br/>
<br/>
There is no right or wrong, I just like to keep them on the move!!!<br/>
