                    <div class="plaintext-content">Unfortunately, sometimes geocachers don't know that the box is a letterbox<br/>
(and not a geocache) and take the stamp &amp; leave something in it's place. I<br/>
had this happen in two of my boxes in the same park--lost the handcarved<br/>
stamps and gained a bumpersticker and a keychain. :-(  But, how are they to<br/>
know if they don't know about letterboxing? So, now I mark all of my boxes<br/>
very clearly as "NOT A GEOCACHE!" as well as the usual letterboxing info, in<br/>
the hopes that it doesn't happen again.<br/>
<br/>
I think the hybrids are great--introduces both hobbies to each other. I've<br/>
even passed a long a "Hybrid hitchhiker/travel bug" from one hybrid box to<br/>
another. It's great the geocaching.com has a special icon for this type of<br/>
box!<br/>
