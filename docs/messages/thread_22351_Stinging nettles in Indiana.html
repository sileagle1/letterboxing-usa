(since Apr-04).  To those of you who have been scorned, were you hiking in<br/>
shorts?  If not, could you tell us which boxes you were hunting when you<br/>
encountered the nettles?  Is it possible not to be affected by direct<br/>
contact with this plant?  I don't intentionally plant my boxes in PI and<br/>
nettles, so if mine are guilty, please contact me.<br/>
