Over on Atlas Quest we were dicussing the lack of a standard <br/>
letterboxing logo.  After much debate on the need for the need and <br/>
design of a logo, it was decided that it should have something to do <br/>
with a full compass design containing "L" and "B".  The following is a <br/>
link to my version of the design on hats that I've had made.....<br/>

<br/>
Let me know if it doesn't work.  If you're interested in a hat just let <br/>
me know.<br/>
