                    <div class="plaintext-content">On the clue pages, each state has a map with the outlines of the <br/>
counties.  When there is a box in the county, the county is <br/>
colored green.  I just placed boxes in Twiggs Co, GA - a virgin <br/>
county!  Now that we are all posting our own clues, who will color in <br/>
the counties?<br/>
<br/>
Also, on the old clues pages, Virginia is broken down into <br/>
four regions.  On the new clues page, there is no regional breakdown.  <br/>
If it's not too much trouble, it would be great to include the <br/>
regional breakdowns.  <br/>
<br/>
I like the way the boxes are sorted, first by county then city then <br/>
alphabetically.  On the old clues page for Virginia, it was <br/>
alphabetically within the county which meant that you had to search <br/>
through the entire county list to find boxes in a particular town.<br/>
<br/>
Also on a good note, I didn't have any problems adding my <br/>
existing boxes to the new pages!  But now they are shown on both <br/>
sites.  Are we supposed to do anything to remove them from the old <br/>
site?  <br/>

I'll color in counties.  Just email me off list and tell me what county and where it is, and I'll fill it in.<br/>
<br/>
Regional listings are slowly, but surely being added.<br/>
