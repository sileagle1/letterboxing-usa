It could be a mini gathering + workshop type thing. My sister sells S.U. products. For those of you that are not familiar with this, it is a company that makes thousands of stamps and also offers nice paper/card stock and many inks. It is sold at Tupperware type parties with a rep demonstrating techniques and such. I think it could be fun and NO PRESSURE TO BUY! Just, like I said, a mini gathering for stamping and LB enthusiasts, and a chance to exchange. It could also be made kid friendly.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I just want to see if anyone would be interested. I've gotten no further then that in the planning.<br/>
