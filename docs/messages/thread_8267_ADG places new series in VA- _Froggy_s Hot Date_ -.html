Well we did get lost on the second clues.  When you said he <br/>
remembered that was the wrong way we thought you meant don't go that <br/>
way and go the other way.  Or something like that.  Do you know how <br/>
many fallen trees there are pointing almost north up the wrong <br/>
trail?  Oh well.  Started over twice and finally figured it out.  <br/>
Once we did the hidden trail was cool.  <br/>
<br/>
You need more rocks though I think.  We were late and sorry we didn't <br/>
go find more.  We finished as it got dark which was appropo to the <br/>
story.<br/>
<br/>
I was fascinated by the old road.  I imagined different peoples using <br/>
it over its many years.  Found a garter snake crossing it.  Doesn't <br/>
that mean something when a friendly snake crosses your path.  Finding <br/>
new interesting places is what's it's all about for me.<br/>
<br/>
We were the first to stamp in.  Woohoo.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad you enjoyed the boxes!  Sarah is going to make her husband go <br/>
find the boxes on Saturday to verify the clues since there are so <br/>
many and they are a bit confusing.  It really was a fine balance <br/>
between story and clues so I am glad you were able to work it out.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, the Oracle box is not that far from where you start that <br/>
section of clues so it probably didn't take you too long to backtrack <br/>
and find it.  That is a really cool area isn't it?  We wanted to put <br/>
the cairn of rocks in the middle of the clearing for a more mystical <br/>
feel but there does seem to be a shortage of rocks out there.  I have <br/>
convinced Sarah to find others and hike them out there when they <br/>
visit on Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
Didn't we meet you on the trail while searching for the Christmas <br/>
Tree Graveyard box?<br/>
