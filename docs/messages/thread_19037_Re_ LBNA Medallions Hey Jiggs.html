<br/>
If I misread the intent and tone of your email I do apologize.  I <br/>
was very simply trying to direct what appeared to be a personal <br/>
business transaction issue into a private email before it became <br/>
some heated topic because someone got offended that you insinuated <br/>
something.  It is very easy to misread the tone of an email or post <br/>
at times, such is the biggest problem with text based <br/>
communications.  <br/>
<br/>
As I said, if I misread your words I apologize, I do however still <br/>
suggest that you email whoever is in charge of the medallions <br/>
privately because as I said I know several people who have received <br/>
theirs.<br/>

posted a similar query on the big list in an attempt to engage the <br/>

File under "No good deed goes unpunished...." Jim is a good guy who's doing <br/>
this just to be nice and give back to the letterboxing community, and the <br/>
medallions have to be custom produced and that can't be done overnight, so <br/>
just be patient and I'm sure that it will all work out.<br/>

there's no communication.  You seem to know this individual....  Is <br/>
there any way you can communicate to him just to have him contact me <br/>
regarding this problem?  I've mentioned that I've tried, but I had <br/>
no success.  I'm not seeking to "punish" anyone, but I have waited <br/>
almost 2 months past the promised delivery date, and I just want to <br/>
be assured that my merchandise is on its way.<br/>
