<div><span class="060325717-03042002">Yesterday I went Letterbox hunting only a mile from my 
home (at the Madronna Marsh Preserve, LA County, CA), and found two very cute 
letterboxes (this was just about my speed too, easy drive, easy walk, easy 
find).  The added show was a great surprise... the bunny chase.  There 
were two classrooms of kids flushing-out abondoned pet bunnies and trying to 
catch them.  What a RIOT to whatch!!  I hope my pictures come 
out.  There was one kid who really could keep-up with the bunny.  He 
could definitely have a career in Track.</span></div>

<div><span class="060325717-03042002">So 
far I was the first to visit your new letterboxes, but I'm sure there will be 
alot more.  They are in a perfect place for me to tell my neighbors to 
try-out the Letterboxing experience.</span></div>
<div><span class="060325717-03042002"></span> </div>
<div><span class="060325717-03042002">Thank You so much for such a nice lunch break 
yesterday.  AND Thank You again for the great lunch at Joe Jost's last 
week, and assistance with that elusive Letterbox.</span></div>
