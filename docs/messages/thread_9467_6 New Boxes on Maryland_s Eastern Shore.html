                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Forest Frog Family had a very busy Thanksgiving Holiday Weekend, <br/>
and we have the boxes to prove it.  Mama Frog went on a carving <br/>
spree before our trip to the Eastern Shore, and we trekked around on <br/>
Wednesday and Friday, stashing boxes along the way.  Little Frog <br/>
(age 4) threatened mutiny several times, but in the end, he was <br/>
quite a trooper.<br/>
<br/>
Two boxes in Kent County, Eastern Neck NWR (near Rock Hall, MD):<br/>

MD):<br/>

We hope these boxes will get some visitors very soon, and hope you <br/>
enjoy the hikes as much as we did (even Little Frog)!<br/>
