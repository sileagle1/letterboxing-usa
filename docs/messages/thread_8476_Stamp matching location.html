It doesn't matter if the stamps match the location.  I try to match <br/>
them whenever possible but sometimes I go along with a theme instead-<br/>
-such as a historical event in the area or a hobby that might match <br/>
the region.  I stretched it when I placed a Seattle Mariners <br/>
baseball letterbox along some old railroad tracks a few months <br/>
back.  I connected the two because there are RR tracks close to the <br/>
Seattle Mariners' homefield in Seattle (although the tracks I placed <br/>
the letterbox near are 60 miles away!!!) and the train engineers <br/>
sound the whistle whenever they pass by the ballpark.  I was really <br/>
stretching it but nnow there's another letterbox in a place that <br/>
once had none AND it's a really nice little outing along a little <br/>
visited area for letterboxers to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.  Hope to see your new stamps along the letterboxing <br/>
trails....<br/>

This is one of the ADG's favorite running gags.  Since Sarah is our <br/>
carving master and I am the official correspondent, we often find <br/>
that our stamps, locations, and clues have absolutely nothing to do <br/>
with each other.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is fun to try to make them all meet in the middle as you <br/>
can tell from Froggy's Hot Date and Ranger Tom's Excellent <br/>
Adventure.  I put a Turtle and a Mountain Scorpia on a bench playing <br/>
canasta just so I could work them into the story.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess my answer is yes,no, maybe.  Have fun and enjoy the <br/>
experiences!<br/>

Funny what you can find at the thrift shops in the "plastic <br/>
