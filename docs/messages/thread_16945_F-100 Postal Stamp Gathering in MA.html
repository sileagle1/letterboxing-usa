&gt; encouraged mini-gatherings to get this stamp - even<br/>
&gt; those who have <br/>
&gt; not yet reached 100 but would like to exchange<br/>
&gt; anyway. If you have <br/>
&gt; hit the 100 mark, she asks that you also list what<br/>

OK, Western MA boxers. In the same spirit, let's have<br/>
a little mini-gathering at some point in the very near<br/>
future, like once this box makes it to us in<br/>
Westfield. I know there are at least a couple of us<br/>
out here that have hit F-100, and there are lots of<br/>
you that we've never met, so let's use this as an<br/>
excuse! I'm thinking Stanley Park in Westfield maybe<br/>
next weekend, early Saturday or Sunday? Contact me<br/>
offlist if you're interested in a get-together. Hell,<br/>
if there's enough people interested, I might even<br/>
carve an event stamp...<br/>
