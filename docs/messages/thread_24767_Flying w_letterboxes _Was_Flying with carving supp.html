my carry-on bag.  I had intended to plant it during this trip, but it<br/>
didn't happen.  On my way home, the screener at the Philly airport<br/>
pulled me aside and searched my carry-on bag, because they saw the<br/>
hollowed-out book on the x-ray!  My brief explaination was accepted; I<br/>
think the screener could tell that the stamp inside the book was rubber<br/>
and not some kind of explosive!  But in the future, I think I'll check<br/>
that kind of thing...<br/>
