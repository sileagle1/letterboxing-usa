letterboxes hoping to supplement the few boxes already in the area <br/>
and to entice boxers to visit Western CT.  If these go well I hope to <br/>
plant a dozen or so more this spring/summer.<br/>

BEE-UTIFUL VIEW LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Bee Brook located on Rte 47 in Washington, CT<br/>
Just over a mile to the letterbox on steep terrain.<br/>
Dogs must be leashed. <br/>
<br/>
Park in the parking area at the south end of the bridge.  Walk south <br/>
toward the fence of the nearby house and then turn east up the <br/>
grassy, dirt road to the top entrance which will give you access to <br/>
the higher part of the yellow trail and the Steep Rock Reservation  <br/>
Hidden Valley gate.  Take notice of the posted trail map  your goal <br/>
is the Pinnacle.  Proceed straight down the yellow trail enjoying the <br/>
sounds of the Shepaug River.<br/>
<br/>
In less than 1/8 mile the trail splits  go right up hill.  At the <br/>
first small 4-way intersection, go straight, following the yellow <br/>
blaze.  At the next 4-way intersection, turn right staying on the <br/>
marked yellow trail.<br/>
<br/>
At the top turn right onto the blue trail at the sign No Horses on <br/>
the Pinnacle.  This short uphill trail loops around the Pinnacle <br/>
giving you a bee-utiful view. <br/>
<br/>
Follow the loop to the right and at the tree with the blue blaze take <br/>
a 310-degree reading.  Reach behind the small dead log and under the <br/>
edge of the boulder for a small rock securing the box.  Take the box <br/>
a few yards up to enjoy the Pinnacle while stamping in.<br/>
<br/>
Return to your car the way you came or enjoy exploring the other two <br/>
letterboxes located in this area.<br/>
