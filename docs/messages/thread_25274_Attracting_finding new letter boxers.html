Along these lines the subject of newbies. I really think the best way to bring people into the hobby is WOM, taking someone out on the trail and showing them the ropes. Reading about letterboxing in a magazine or newspaper can leave out some very important points.<br/>
Case in point. I walk the trail behind my house almost every day with the dog as I go along I check on my boxes. 2 days ago every box had just a corner sticking out, I guess to make it easier for the next finder. Then yesterday the last box in the series was completly out in the open several feet away from it's hiding spot, sitting on a ledge. <br/>
I designed this series with newbies in mind but the most basic tenant of boxing is to re-hide well. One of the flaws of the letterboxing articles are they present the hobby as a kids game. To me it's an adult pastime kids can participate in. I started out with my kids but they have moved on.<br/>
Over the years I have told friends and acquaintances about boxing, most of the time I get a glazed over look or my favorite response "you have too much time on your hands".<br/>
Who are the ones who are interested? Outdoor types with an artistic bent.<br/>

&gt; As a newbie (one who is interested, but never tried it).  I think that, and maybe a couple "easy finds" might be a good way to attract people.  A local meet up group would be great, especially if you were able to offer a "getting started" class every so often.  I have to say, one of the reason's I haven't started is it all seems a bit difficult to me.  <br/>

&gt;   <br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions on how to attract new people and tell them about the hobby without messing with the mystique of it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've considered making a kind of floating hitchhiker or newbie box to be left in public places like under a chair in starbucks or in a library or something to that effect. Not very well hidden, but the point of this would be for people to find it, be curious, and learn about whats inside. Granted, this would have a high risk is disappearing. And there's always the risk the wrong kind of person could discover it and go on a box stealing spree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So it's just a thought. Does anyone else have any suggestions or ideas? I've also considering making a local meetup group...<br/>
