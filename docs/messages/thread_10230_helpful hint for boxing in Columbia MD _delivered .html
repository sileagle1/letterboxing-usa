                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those of you who plan to box before or after the meet and greet <br/>
on the 18th, the following info will be either extremely helpful or <br/>
agonizingly exasperating.  I will explain below.<br/>
<br/>
When Firefly collected her 100th box, several of the MD boxers <br/>
gathered to celebrate her glorious success.  After a fabulous lunch, <br/>
the group broke in two and Squirrel, TempusfugitMD, and Sarah and <br/>
Tammy of the ADG headed to Centennial Lake to get the Stanley's <br/>
Surprise series and Firefly's Centennial Lake boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Squirrel had actually gotten the Centennial Lake box earlier in the <br/>
day.  During our trip to find Stanley's boxes, Sarah and I told <br/>
Squirrel that during our last meeting, we had secreted a cuckoo clue <br/>
into Loonerism Better Spox behind her back after she stamped in.  She <br/>
was a little perturbed but took it in the right spirit.  When we <br/>
finished the Stanley series, Squirrel mentioned that Firefly's <br/>
Centennial Lake box was just down the hill somewhere in the <br/>
Arboretum.  So we headed down the hill only to discover that the <br/>
trail ends at the lake right in the middle of the Arboretum.  Since <br/>
we didn't know which way to go, we asked Squirrel for advice.  <br/>
Playing coy, Squirrel told us to check the map and took a seat on the <br/>
nearest bench.  After making what we thought was an informed <br/>
decision, we headed off in our chosen direction.  Squirrel <br/>
hollered, "See you when you get back."  Assuming that this meant we <br/>
were heading in the wrong direction, I then asked if we should go the <br/>
other way.  Squirrel replied, "You have to come back this way to get <br/>
back to the car."  (take a moment and consider how incredibly <br/>
brilliant and sarcastic this statement is and then bow your head in <br/>
honor of the Squirrel)  <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, we went the wrong way.  But the good new is that the <br/>
arboretum ends pretty quickly so you won't have to backtrack far.  So <br/>
take your best guess and think of the coy Squirrel when you find this <br/>
box.  You will definitely save time by approaching these boxes in <br/>
this manner, even if you pick the wrong direction in the arboretum.  <br/>
Hope you enjoyed this little tidbit! <br/>
