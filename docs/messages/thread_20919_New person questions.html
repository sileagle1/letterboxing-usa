Okay... I'm new to this whole letterbox thing, but will be taking a trip to <br/>
Florida in a week or so and am going to try to find some there. I have three <br/>
friends from another state meeting me there. I have asked them to each bring <br/>
along a stamp that describes themselves... I'm not going to tell them why or what <br/>
until we're on our way to try to find the first one. <br/>
<br/>
So now as I read everyone's messages ... I have a couple questions... <br/>
1) Someone said to check out Mark Pepe's newbie site... but I don't know how <br/>
to get there... what is his web address?<br/>
2) Someone said they checked their LB and found an HH... ???? What is an <br/>
HH??? And why is it a dilemma? <br/>
3) If anybody has anything to share with someone who has never done this <br/>
before... please speak... e-mail me privately if necessary. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks! I wish I had known about this when my boys were younger. <br/>

&gt; 2)  What is an HH??? <br/>
<br/>
**snip**<br/>
It's a hitch hiker (aka travelling letterbox, aka parasite, aka <br/>
travelbug if you had GPS in hand). For nore info: <br/>

<br/>
**snip**   <br/>
A couple general guidelines are:<br/>
1) Have fun! <br/>
2) Leave the box in the condition you found it OR in better condition <br/>
(I.e. replace baggies, rehide well, etc)<br/>
3) Have Fun! <br/>
4) There's no real rules, so have fun!<br/>

<br/>
It's so good to hear from someone like us! Overwhelmed.  Go to Yahoo groups <br/>
and join Newboxers, they are very friendly and according to their logo "No <br/>
question is a dumb question."  Also FAQ on the main site helped us alot. We've <br/>
only found two boxes so far but love the hobby and we're carving a personal <br/>
stamp. Winter is starting here and it will be hard to get out and actually look, <br/>
but carving can still be done. Have fun Wayne, Lynn and Mickey in upstate NY<br/>

To the newbie about Hitchhikers-- well, around here they can be a dilemma (whether to take it or leave it) because many of the possible host boxes are too small to place one in. I currently have a large hitchhiker and have found 5 boxes since I got it, but not one could hold the hitchhiker, so it is languishing. It's frustrating, esp. since I can't remember which boxes around here that I've found in the past would have room.

 You can be specific when you email the Hitchhiker creator. But if <br/>
you are posting to a general talk list like this one, I would not <br/>
tell where exactly you left the hitchhiker, just because most people <br/>
like for it to be a surprise. But the original creator of the <br/>
Hitchhiker has every right to know exactly where his/her Hitchhiker <br/>
is located! <br/>
This is how hitchhikers get LOST and never see the light of day <br/>
again, because people don't tell where they are! <br/>

  A possible solution to the below where the hitchhiker is too big to fit in <br/>
a letterbox, what we ended up doing on one occasion was to make sure the <br/>
hitchhiker was bagged quite well, and then we put that inside a gallon-sized <br/>
plastic baggie along with the letterbox container.<br/>

I wrote that all wrong and read Samanark's email all wrong.  ( I think, anyway.. I don't have the original anymore.)  Yes, yes, of course-- do what I meant, not what I said!  Email the creator and let them know where you found the hitchhiker and where you left it.  But don't say what box you left it in on a website or talk-list.  It's a good thing I'm not regularly counseling newbies.  could be something IS in the water around here, Lightnin' Bug!  OK, I'm going to bed now &amp; will shut up tomorrow until the fog clears.  <br/>
