Hope this helps... (from a Colorado newbie wishing there were Letterboxes <br/>
around here...)<br/>

I am so glad we have someone on board from Colorado!  Having lived there for more than a decade, it has been a surprise to me that we have not had any boxes there yet.  However, I think Jay (of CT letterboxing fame) is vacationing in your beautiful state, so I would think the chances are good that some boxes may start popping up.  <br/>
<br/>
You do still have the opportunity to be the _first_ to plant  a box in in your state.  (see http://www.letterboxing.org/series.html#states)  Thi sis your opportunity to make history :)  Wouldn't the Garden of the Gods be a fantastic place for a box?<br/>
<br/>
Also, thanks for the input and leads on free webspace.  All well worth exploring.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, I put out the first GeoCache in Colorado a couple of weekends ago <br/>
(http://www.braveheart.com.au for info), and then stumbled on Letterboxing from <br/>
their website.  Garden of the Gods area was one place I already had in mind (I <br/>
know a couple of really nice places hidden in there for a letterbox and/or <br/>
geocache) so don't be surprised to see them start to show up here soon...  <br/>
While they are fun to place, I'd like to go searching for some myself.  <br/>
