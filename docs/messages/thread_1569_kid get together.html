                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been wanting to do this!  Actually was planning a fall <br/>
letterboxing event when my sons swim schedule came and I realized we <br/>
had no free weekends left.  UGH!  Well there will be some after the <br/>
holidays and January or Feb are a great time to get out. I have <br/>
access to a fascility plenty large enough  ( 4-H fair grounds) .<br/>
The main building even has a kitchen. It is located in Tolland or <br/>
Vernon , Ct, on the line on Rte 30. There are 2 boxes near there and <br/>
I have a private box at the fairgrounds, We plan to do a few more in <br/>
that area. We could do some 1 day boxes  too.   I'll see what dates <br/>
the buildings are free next week when the office there is open. Any  <br/>
other ideas?  We have an ice cream offer, I can do other dairy <br/>
products as we have a dairy farm. My 4-H kids will love this. We <br/>
could do potluck lunch or there are some people we might persuade to <br/>
cook for the group. Send feed back.  Carol - in going to check Wolf <br/>
Rock now before the swim meet. <br/>
