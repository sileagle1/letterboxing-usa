2002 in Paris, it quickly flew to CT (Mecca to all well traveled <br/>
HH's), then a jaunt to lovely GA and now to my abode. It still has <br/>
it's original traveling baggie! <br/>
  Princess Turtle and I were bummed when we went to Paris and <br/>
discovered we had just missed finding this little treasure. We had <br/>
just met Sarah of AppledumplingGang and marveled over her carvings. <br/>
So it was a "must find" to collect this carving. Now we are happy to <br/>
receive it after it's travels. First Find is good, but Last Find is <br/>
best. I love to read what everyone has written. <br/>
  I will have to make this a special carry-out delivery. <br/>
