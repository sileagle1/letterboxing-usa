I started letterboxing in Nov, 2003.  There were just 13 LBs in the <br/>
Western 1/2 of Oklahoma.  I was thrilled about those 13, but knew I'd <br/>
fly through them.  For the past year, I've been focusing on other <br/>
states somewhat.  Today I looked at the Oklahoma site and realized <br/>
that there are tons more - 72 (again, just in the Western 1/2).  <br/>
Phenomenal!  I can hardly believe it.  I'd better get busy if I wanna <br/>
keep up with my own state now!  <br/>
<br/>
What are some of the experiences in other states?  (Yeah, yeah, I <br/>
know about you connecticutins(???).  Don't laugh at <br/>
Oklahoma's "meager" selection.  You blow us all out of the water!) ;)<br/>

When I started letterboxing there was only 1 letterbox in the Seattle <br/>
area and about a dozen in the entire state. Now there are <br/>
approximately 300 in the Seattle area alone!! (and I have only <br/>
planted about 30 of them)<br/>

Eighteen months ago, I had found every letterbox in Western New York <br/>
between Rochester NY, and Eire PA... both of them!  I was, to my <br/>
knowledge, the only letterboxer in these parts and I had to wait for<br/>
opportunities to travel in order to letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday was the 1st Annual WNY Letterbox Gathering.  My total for<br/>
yesterday alone is over 30 exchanges and 20 boxes.  And I have a list<br/>
of the 20+ boxes in the area that have been planted since I started<br/>
Grad School this fall.<br/>

I hear ya. I started about 3 years ago in GA and there were 13 boxes. We have well over a <br/>
hundred now, not including WOMs and such. BLAM! Here they are.<br/>
<br/>
KInd of fun though, b/c the crew in the SE are soooo very friendly. We're working on <br/>
carving nights, a new step for us. Should be a lot of fun, with some training on techniques <br/>
to boot.<br/>
<br/>
Growth, though scary in its possible implications, isn't always bad. The SE folks have <br/>
proven themselves to be particularly careful to respect traditions and rules, and foster <br/>
good spirit.<br/>
<br/>
I would have never imagined that the SE would become what it is today. It is a  blessing.<br/>
