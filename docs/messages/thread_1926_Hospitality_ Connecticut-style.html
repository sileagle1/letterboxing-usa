                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, so my opinion about hitchhiker boxes is clearly unpopular and I <br/>
got clobbered for it. Well now there is another thing - an idea - <br/>
that's been on my mind lately. I could get REALLY slammed by the <br/>
group for this one. So, with much trepidation, here goes:<br/>
<br/>
Most of you are aware that southeast CT is not only beautiful, but it <br/>
is letterbox HEAVEN. I live in Ledyard, a very high letterbox-density <br/>
area. There are about 50+ boxes within 30 minutes of my home; many <br/>
are much closer. Most boxes in Rhode Island are within 45 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to offer some hospitality to the members of the letterboxing <br/>
community and open my home to weary 'boxers for a night or two. I <br/>
know the cost of lodging and that is where my "cheap streak" lies. <br/>
(Think of all the other cool stuff you could do if you didn't have to <br/>
lay out the cash for a hotel room.)<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I would love to go out to Oregon for the April <br/>
gathering, but ooohh I hate paying for a hotel room for the whole <br/>
stay. Is there anyone from Portland with a spare room who would be <br/>
interested in "putting us up" for a few nights at the end of April?? <br/>
Come to CT sometime and you've got a free place to stay, too. <br/>
<br/>
If someone would like to explore the possibilities of this (OFF-<br/>
LIST), please e-mail me.<br/>

I think it's great of you to offer "crash space" to out-of-town <br/>
LBers. To put forth a trusting hand in such a way, and to get to know <br/>
better fellows of the sport is to help in making us a closer <br/>
"family." I don't blame you either for seeking out a cheap and homey <br/>
place to stay. I did the same for many years as a "ski bum." I <br/>
was also in AFS as a high school student, and my family hosted <br/>
several forgeign exchange students for periods lasting from 3 days <br/>
to 10 months. Staying with or at least getting to know the locals <br/>
will be enriching and add great memories to your vacation.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I know there is web site to look up registered sex offenders and <br/>
violent criminals somewhere....;)<br/>
