                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, now that I've had time to regroup, I'm more than<br/>
a little embarassed.  I did, in fact, return home from<br/>
a long trip away and I did in fact enter into a home<br/>
that was somewhat more spruced up than mine was when I<br/>
left.  After that the facts are a little vague.  <br/>
<br/>
Now tell me none of y'all would have done the same<br/>
thing I did - LOL.  I returned home and was very tired<br/>
after a long trip home following a long time away. <br/>
Even though I was a little befuddled, I was pleasantly<br/>
surprised by such a lovely entrance to my home.  There<br/>
was indeed a perturbed woman there (she looked like<br/>
Martha!), fussing away at me about a key under the<br/>
doormat - I still haven't figured out what THAT was<br/>
all about.  I went into the house and fell quickly<br/>
asleep.  Well, I was rudely awakened by lights shining<br/>
in my eyes and was dragged out the door - Martha,<br/>
meanwhile, shrieking away about people invading her<br/>
space.  It took me a day or two to really get my wits<br/>
about me again, but imagine my surprise when I learned<br/>
that I hadn't entered my own home, but someone else's,<br/>
and the lady wasn't Martha at all, but my neighbor's<br/>
mother who was watching her home while she too was<br/>
away.  <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, the neighbor's mom isn't too thrilled<br/>
with me and the neighborhood association is<br/>
considering what action they can take against me. <br/>
Unfortunately, they fail to see the humor of the<br/>
situation and I guess none of them can put themselves<br/>
in my shoes (possibly because I don't wear shoes???)<br/>
to see it happening to them (I mean really, we live in<br/>
one of those cookie cutter neighborhoods!).  The rumor<br/>
around the neighborhood is that I was extremely<br/>
intoxicated, but I swear, I hadn't been drinking at<br/>
all, but was extremely jet-lagged, and I'm sticking<br/>
with that particular story, at least until after the<br/>
hearing.<br/>
<br/>
So, the Martha sighting I reported was the rantings of<br/>
a sleep-deprived woman.  Martha apparently remains at<br/>
large, and Wanda would very much like to know her<br/>
whereabouts, especially since I would imagine Wanda is<br/>
expected to keep close tabs on Martha during Martha's<br/>
(ahem) delicate legal situation.<br/>
<br/>
I know this casts a questionable light on my<br/>
character, but I felt it was important to rectify my<br/>
public statement about having Martha in my custody. <br/>
She is not, I repeat NOT, in my home, despite the<br/>
Martha sort-of-look-alike lady that now glares at me<br/>
every time I go out to my car.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerly,<br/>
BarefootLucy<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  The short explanation of my false sighting is<br/>
that I received Dog Scout's Snail Mail box FROM Wanda.<br/>
 I saw Wanda's name, and jumped to the conclusion that<br/>
it was Martha.  This was truly after a long trip away,<br/>
so I wasn't operating on all cylinders.  Now that I'm<br/>
back on track, I'm still looking for Martha, but I<br/>
will be sending Snail Mail along in a day or two.  My<br/>
kids are just finishing up their first stamps, so I<br/>
want to set it free with those lovely imprints of<br/>
theirs!<br/>

since Martha #2 is apparently ... well, I don't know what to call it.<br/>
<br/>
I have been emailing the person who had her last, and she has not <br/>
responded to my emails except the first one which was about 2? <br/>
months ago. At that time she appologized for the fact that she put <br/>
Martha By Mail in the closet, when the letterbox arrived and forgot <br/>
about her for a month, promising to send her out asap. That was a <br/>
loooong time ago, and she has not answered my emails since then, and <br/>
neither has the next person on the list received that postal <br/>
letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I will just have to chalk this one up to ... what? <br/>
