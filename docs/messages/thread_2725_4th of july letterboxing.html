                    <html><body>What a great day for letterboxing. I visited the Quabbin Reservoir in 
<br/>Massachusetts.  we could not locate the moon and stars box, but we did find 
<br/>the salamander box.  We also picked up a hitch hiker named ready freddy on 
<br/>the open road.  freddy will be on his next adventure soon.  Tuesday I took a 
<br/>group of kids to Mansfield Hollow where they located two boxes - the Grumpy 
<br/>box and the Opening Day box.  both boxes are in great shape.  My group was so 
<br/>excited about the find they cant wait to visit Sleeping Giant next week.  
<br/>Quick question: does anyone know if there is a box hidden at Newgate Prison 
<br/>in East Granby.  I thought I saw clues for it but cant find them on the 
<br/>website. 
<br/>Thanks AmyB</body></html>
