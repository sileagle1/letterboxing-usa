<br/>
On Saturday, Butterfly and Bluebird were nice enough to take me out. <br/>
We were quickly joined by Musicwoman.  We went galavanting all over<br/>
the countryside looking for letterboxes.  By 11:00 we had found quite<br/>
a few boxes and arrived at the mini-gathering at Montville High<br/>
School.  It was great to see everyone and swap stories.  I have been<br/>
out of letterboxing for only a few months but it feels like years.  I<br/>
loved hearing everyones new stories.  It was great!  I hope to see<br/>
everyone out on the trail soon.  Safe Letterboxing!   <br/>
