<br/>
<br/>Crisp and Cookie hid a new letterbox in Mounds State Park, Anderson, Indiana 
<br/>on July 31, 2001.  Anderson is located in Madison County.
<br/>
<br/>Here are our clues, please start clue posting from here:
<br/>
<br/>The Crescent Moon Letterbox
<br/>
<br/>The Crescent Moon Letterbox is the first in East Central Indiana.  Make your 
<br/>way to Mounds State Park in Anderson, Indiana, following Interstate 69 to 
<br/>Route 32 East to Mounds Road, following the signs for the park. 
<br/>
<br/>Once in the park, obtain a trail map from the park rangers at the entrance 
<br/>gate.  Take the gravel path past the Nature Center.  At the first fork, take 
<br/>the path for Trail 1.  Pass the Great Mound on your right and stop to learn 
<br/>about how they were created over 1500 years ago.  Stay on the trail towards 
<br/>the White River.  At the first 4-way intersection, head towards the giant 
<br/>slingshot.  Take 90 steps forward and mount a climb back up the hill on the 
<br/>wooden steps. Just a little further ahead on this trail, there will be a 
<br/>rotting stump in the center of the trail.  From this stump take 7 steps and 
<br/>look for a woodland creature's hiding place, and there you will find the 
<br/>Crescent Moon Letterbox.  Please be sure to cover it up with leaves or 
<br/>branches for the next hunter.
