<br/>
My husband and I were out geocaching at the Rancocas Wildlife center in <br/>
Burlington county, NJ yesterday when we happened upon an accidental <br/>
find. We thought it was a geocache, but was labelled as "Toolbox #1" <br/>
and contained the address www.letterboxing.org. It was out on the <br/>
ground in plain view, so we signed the log and rehid it in its original <br/>
hiding spot, it was obvious where it was supposed to go. The log had <br/>
not been signed in nearly a year, but seemed to be in good shape. The <br/>
container also had a homemade rubber stamp in it. Obviously, we know <br/>
nothing of letterboxing, and had never heard of it till yesterday, and <br/>
don't know anything about how it works. <br/>
I cannot find this letterbox cache listed on the website, does this <br/>
mean it has been archived? (do they GET archived?) Should this <br/>
container be removed from the park? Thanks for any info!<br/>

Hiya Sue,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking care of this box.<br/>
<br/>
I don't find this letterbox in letterboxing.org or in our <br/>
archives either. It's not uncommon for members to delete <br/>
boxes that they believe are missing. Sometimes they show <br/>
up again later.<br/>
<br/>
Did the letterbox say who placed it? If so we might be <br/>
able to trace them that way. Otherwise, we should find <br/>
someone local to the area to adopt the box so that the <br/>
clues can be posted again.<br/>

are now not listed, but I don't remember the name having anything to <br/>

wandered from its host box before it was removed.<br/>
