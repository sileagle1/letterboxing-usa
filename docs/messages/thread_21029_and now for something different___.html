<br/>
Don't ever write a placer saying a box is "missing".<br/>
When you do this, you are assuming that you are<br/>
correct in your thinking and the placer is wrong. You<br/>
will likely not get a response when writing about a<br/>
missing box. The placer will likely roll their eyes<br/>
and hit delete. The correct and polite way to address<br/>
the situation is to write the placer and say that you<br/>
looked for their box, but was unable to find it. By<br/>
taking the responsibility upon yourself for not<br/>
finding the box, you will likely get a much more<br/>
pleasant response from the placer. <br/>
<br/>
Of all the boxes I've looked for, every time i've<br/>
contacted a placer about not being able to find one,<br/>
I've gotten a very warm and welcoming response. Why?<br/>
Because I respect the fact that the placer knows where<br/>
their own box is and i'm not going to assume that I<br/>
was looking in the right place. Nearly every time I<br/>
couldn't find a box was because I had the wrong place,<br/>
path, bearing, paces, etc. Take responsibility and own<br/>
up to your shortcomings! We are not perfect! When we<br/>
can admit that we are not perfect beings, we are ready<br/>
to accept the help that people have to give us. <br/>
<br/>
Bickering and elitism is not the answer either. Why<br/>
argue about it? Why tear each other down? If we're all<br/>
responsible for ourselves, then we can focus on being<br/>
a community together as opposed to a community<br/>
divided. <br/>

Thank you, Armadillo Jo, for the nice post.<br/>
<br/>
I am pleased that Armadillo Jo hails from my neck of the woods.  She has been very kind to  <br/>
remind me to reprint clues before finding her boxes.  And I will admit I was negligent once <br/>
in this regard.  The state of letterboxing here is just starting to take off with many new <br/>
plants.  Anyhow ... come and Wander Indiana!<br/>

Armadillo Jo,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for a great way to contact the placer.  As a newbie (F1), I <br/>
may have stepped on someone's toes if I couldn't find a box.  <br/>
