<br/>
Our little gang of 13 travelers headed to Dartmoor have chosen the <br/>
name: The LBNa Baker's Dozen. And we leave 3 weeks from tomorrow!<br/>
<br/>
With that in mind, I ask all who have thought about carving a HH for <br/>
us to share with the Brits, to get them to me no later than September <br/>
13 so that we can get them packed away. I will also be asking for <br/>
postage to return to you as we have over 10 at last count and the <br/>
numbers go up every day! If you plan on attending the Monster Mash in <br/>
Mansfied, email me and I will return your HH to you in Mansfield, CT <br/>
on October 2.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for those beauties that we have already received. Some of the <br/>
best carvers in the country have contributed to this series of HH's. <br/>
<br/>
And stay tuned for our Dartmoor adventures when we return - coming to <br/>
a website near you in early October. Sue absolutely prohibits my <br/>
posting anything on our website while on vacation! Bummer - so I will <br/>
resort to the old fashioned way of keeping a log and will have my <br/>
digital camera going the whole time. Once we return, I plan to start <br/>
posting commentary about our trip, with pictures, on a new website. <br/>
<br/>
Who knows - I may just sneak away to an internet cafe while we are in <br/>
London. Heah Sue, why don't you run along and go shopping with Deanne <br/>
and the others while Dave and I run an errand??<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

at St. Martin in the Fields church, For artsy types<br/>
it's a great way to spend an afternoon. no talent<br/>
required though.  My daughter and I did the big 6ft.<br/>
tall knight.  The cafe in the crypt is a great place<br/>
for lunch. St. Martin's is right on Trafalgar<br/>
square,(and there's an internet cafe just around the<br/>
corner). The Serlock Holmes pub is also just a block<br/>
away, a great place for a photo op. <br/>
