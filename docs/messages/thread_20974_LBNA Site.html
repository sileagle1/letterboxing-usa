I am.  I entered one tonight and it won't show up.  It is listed on <br/>
the clue announcement group, but no where else.  I'm just going to <br/>
leave it till tomorrow and hopefully it will have fixed itself.<br/>

very tricky and may not be found on your first or even<br/>
second try (Schofield Bridge) but if a box is truly<br/>
gone it would be nice to know. There are all kinds of<br/>
boxes out there for all kinds of boxers. I like the<br/>
variety. There are some puzzles I'm saving to try when<br/>
not boxing with an 11 year old who really wants to<br/>
find a box. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm not sure I understand. If the placer can not be<br/>
&gt; contacted how <br/>
&gt; would you know the box is missing? Many treasures go<br/>
&gt; many years, <br/>
&gt; hundreds if not thousands of years, before their <br/>
&gt; secrets are <br/>
&gt; revealed and they are found.Maybe the placer just<br/>
&gt; doesn't want to be <br/>
&gt; contacted, maybe they like the idea of them being<br/>
&gt; out of the <br/>
&gt; picture, long gone and lost in time. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I am fairly new to letterboxing and don't know how<br/>
&gt; most people feel <br/>
&gt; about their  boxes and their clues. But I do know a<br/>
&gt; small bit about <br/>
&gt; treasure hunting and with the treasures I have<br/>
&gt; found,  the hiders <br/>
&gt; have been long gone. Only the trail they left and<br/>
&gt; hard work and some <br/>
&gt; small amount of danger led me to the treasure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I think the boxes I hide will be of this nature.<br/>
&gt; But if the <br/>
&gt; criteria for my clues being removed is you not being<br/>
&gt; able to solve <br/>
&gt; the puzzle perhaps I'm wasting my time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Taking the clues down just because you can not find<br/>
&gt; the box makes <br/>
&gt; no sense at all. It would rob those that can figure<br/>
&gt; out the secret <br/>
&gt; and locate the box. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;This brings up my pet peeve. There are some boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; on there that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; missing for a very long time. They need to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; deleted. If a box is <br/>
&gt; &gt; missing for 6<br/>
&gt; &gt; months or more and is obviously not going to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; replaced it needs to <br/>
&gt; &gt; be deleted<br/>
&gt; &gt; by the placer, or by the site owners, especially if<br/>
&gt; &gt; the placer <br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn't respond<br/>
&gt; &gt; to e-mail. If the placer comes back around and finds<br/>
&gt; &gt; it gone, they <br/>
&gt; &gt; can just put<br/>
&gt; &gt; up a new entry.<br/>
&gt; &gt; missmoon<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm not sure I understand. If the placer can not be<br/>
&gt; &gt; contacted how <br/>
&gt; &gt; would you know the box is missing? Many treasures go<br/>
&gt; &gt; many years, <br/>
&gt; &gt; hundreds if not thousands of years, before their <br/>
&gt; &gt; secrets are <br/>
&gt; &gt; revealed and they are found.Maybe the placer just<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn't want to be <br/>
&gt; &gt; contacted, maybe they like the idea of them being<br/>
&gt; &gt; out of the <br/>
&gt; &gt; picture, long gone and lost in time. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  I am fairly new to letterboxing and don't know how<br/>
&gt; &gt; most people feel <br/>
&gt; &gt; about their  boxes and their clues. But I do know a<br/>
&gt; &gt; small bit about <br/>
&gt; &gt; treasure hunting and with the treasures I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; found,  the hiders <br/>
&gt; &gt; have been long gone. Only the trail they left and<br/>
&gt; &gt; hard work and some <br/>
&gt; &gt; small amount of danger led me to the treasure.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   I think the boxes I hide will be of this nature.<br/>
&gt; &gt; But if the <br/>
&gt; &gt; criteria for my clues being removed is you not being<br/>
&gt; &gt; able to solve <br/>
&gt; &gt; the puzzle perhaps I'm wasting my time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  Taking the clues down just because you can not find<br/>
&gt; &gt; the box makes <br/>
&gt; &gt; no sense at all. It would rob those that can figure<br/>
&gt; &gt; out the secret <br/>
&gt; &gt; and locate the box. <br/>

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.  There have been times we haven't found a box on the first try.  <br/>
Keith tends to give up too quickly, and I tend to overanalyse clues and come with <br/>
a hundred different ways a clue could be deciphered.  So we've ended up <br/>
returning on more than one occasion.  <br/>
<br/>
If we're returning to search again for a box that we know is there -- that's <br/>
something we enjoy doing.  With theft, vandalism, being carried off by an <br/>
animal, etc. being all possibilities, we're not very keen on returning when we're <br/>
not even sure the box still exists. So unless the placer replies when we <br/>
contact them in such a case, and lets us know the box is still alive &amp; well, we <br/>
won't go back unless it suddenly hits us as to what we may have been doing wrong. <br/>
 We don't expect any further clues from the placer, just a note as to the <br/>
last time the box was successfully checked or found.<br/>
<br/>
That's why we check on the boxes we've placed, or use reports from folks who <br/>
have found our boxes, to update the clue pages to each box about every 3 weeks <br/>
or so, so that searchers will know the last time the box was known to be <br/>
alive &amp; well.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Box clues come in all shapes &amp; sizes and that's what makes the hobby/sport <br/>
great.<br/>
<br/>
I hardly think that any clues will ever be taken down because someone simply <br/>
can't find the box.  But I agree with folks who feel that maybe the clues <br/>
should be taken down if a placer can no longer be successfully contacted.   But <br/>
how much extra work might that make for the folks who run the site?  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if a box is going to take us a considerable amount of <br/>
travel time to just get to the starting location, or if the box is in a vulnerable <br/>
area like a city, where it might have a short lifespan, Keith or I will often <br/>
contact the placer before going to search for it, to find out the date of the <br/>
last time it was checked on or reported found.  If we don't receive a reply, <br/>
we just won't bother with that particular box.<br/>
<br/>
If it's a more difficult box with clues that are more difficult to figure, <br/>
that's fine.  Boxes come in all flavours, and rightfully so.  But that doesn't <br/>
mean the placer can't reply to an inquiry about the box and just let the folks <br/>
making the inquiry know when the box was last checked on.  Or if the searcher <br/>
gives the placer a run-down on what steps they took with the clues, the placer <br/>
doesn't have to give anything away about the box -- they could just nicely <br/>
say "no, from your description of events, I can see that you didn't follow the <br/>
clues correctly, better luck next time".  Would that really be such an <br/>
imposition on the placer?  I would hope not.<br/>

&gt; agree.  My very disappointing weekend in NJ looking for the Spy<br/>
&gt; House <br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid that was my bad. In April I went searching for that box and found, <br/>
not a box, but the stamp on the ground in the open and the log book - or what <br/>
appeared to be a log book- a distance away burned beyond recognition. I <br/>
didn't want to leave the stamp there so I took it home and contacted the placer <br/>
right away so that I could mail it to her and let her restock and rehide it <br/>
again. I live an hour away from there and it was a late Sunday afternoon; otherwise <br/>
I would have done it. I did reunite the owner with the stamp but I should <br/>
have also mentioned to the list what happened just in case the placer didn't so <br/>
it would be archived for reference.  Sorry!!<br/>

I'll try to make this as clear as I can.........boxes that have been :::::updated by their placer ::::: as missing for six months or more should be removed. I think 6 months is totally fair. I think that shows a lack of interest on the placer's part. Or.............................................. if no one is able to contact the placer after multiple attempts during a six month period.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone places a box, they have a certain amount of responsibility to keep their e-mail address on the site current. In the past, I've seen posts here from people who have written to a placer and ::::never:::: gotten a response. I think that shows a lack of interest and responsibility on the part of that placer. I wrote to a person one time to ask if a box was still missing and was told that yes it was still missing and the person had no plans for replacing it. Uh......so why is it still on the site? <br/>
<br/>
This hobby seems to be growing in leaps and bounds and at some point the site is going to have to have  some kind of limit imposed in terms of data that is stored on it. You can't just keep adding letterboxes into infinity and never remove the ones that are no longer maintained by anyone. I have no idea how much space there is on it, but at some point the limit will be reached. <br/>
<br/>
All this is JMHO and certainly everyone here is entitled to theirs also. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, I hope everyone here and their loved ones have a wonderful Thanksgiving. We all have much to be thankful for. <br/>

I know some boxers leave the clue page up so that folks who have been <br/>
intending to go searching for the box, and who check the clue page right before they <br/>
head out the door for the search, will know that oops!, the box is missing.  <br/>
Of course, if the clue page has suddenly disappeared if the site is checked <br/>
before heading out the door, that might indeed be a clue that there's no longer a <br/>
box there.  :-) <br/>

Perhaps I am just thinking about the game at a higher level than <br/>
you are inclined to. I'm thinking in terms of searches lasting long <br/>
periods of time and requiring much travel and research. Since you <br/>
don't seem to be interested in this type of quest, you would have no <br/>
desire to find these boxes. This is fine by me but why should others <br/>
not have access to the clues for years or even decades to come?<br/>
<br/>
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br/>
<br/>
A higher level -- or a less experienced level?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you're not aware of the vandalism &amp; theft when non-boxers come across <br/>
the boxes, or that animals quite willingly carry off the box to do what they <br/>
please with.  Is it worth it to do the amount of work you seem to be <br/>
suggesting in search of a little rubber stamp that might or might not still be there?<br/>
<br/>
And in today's economic climate, I don't know how many letterboxers are <br/>
wealthy enough for the "much travel" part.  Unless your first finder gift is real <br/>
pot at the end of the rainbow, folks are only going to be doing all that work <br/>
for a little rubber stamp.  Even if you're the Michelangelo of stamp carvers, <br/>
that might be a bit much to expect.  <br/>
<br/>
That might certainly appeal to a few folks, and if one narrows it down to <br/>
those who can afford the "much travel" part, it'll appeal to a few fewer folks.  <br/>
But that in itself seems as if it appeals to you -- I might be mistaken but I <br/>
get the idea that if nobody were to find your box, you'd be most content.  So, <br/>
hey, whatever floats your boat.  <br/>
<br/>
The question that would raise it's head in my mind is -- are you only going <br/>
in search of these types of boxes yourself?  If you're going around finding <br/>
boxes placed by folks who aren't playing at your lofty level, it might be a bit <br/>
polite to place a few boxes for those folks to find in return that are more <br/>
similar to what they're placing.  We have a crew in our neck of the woods who <br/>
*only* plants mystery boxes.  Yet they run all over searching for all the <br/>
non-mystery boxes in the area, meaning that placers who don't go in for mystery boxes <br/>
really have nothing offered by this crew to go searching for themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
But folks are certainly free to place boxes however they wish.  I'm just a <br/>
believer in sowing what you intend to reap -- at least a little bit.  When we <br/>
moved into the area, we spent late summer and the fall and placed a little over <br/>
a dozen boxes, ten of them quite similar to what we started going around <br/>
finding.  We felt it was a polite thing to do so that the people who had placed the <br/>
boxes we had had the pleasure of finding would have something to come find <br/>
themselves if they wanted to.  Once those were in place, we started on our <br/>
word-of-mouth boxes where we can have a specific "target audience" in mind.  Tho if <br/>
someone is in an area chock full of boxes anyway, it probably wouldn't <br/>
matter.  But our area is not currently chock full of boxes.  So I just kinda think <br/>
it's a polite thing to do.    <br/>

Dear Pippi,<br/>
<br/>
You may not be aware of the history of why this "crew" plants mystery boxes, <br/>
many of which simply require an easily-found password to access the clues.<br/>
<br/>
This team has planted many open-clued boxes, only to have them all stolen.   <br/>
It is certainly not a case of being impolite, rather of security.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure if you found all of your boxes destroyed almost as soon as you <br/>
planted them, you would either stop planting or devise ways to reduce the <br/>
loss. They have taken the courageous path and continued to plant.<br/>
<br/>
I respecfully disagree that one should primarily look for the type of boxes one <br/>
plants; that leads to stagnation.  Our letterboxes are enriched when we visit a <br/>
variety of placers and a variety of types of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Thanksgiving to you and Keith, and to all the placers and finders who <br/>
have enriched my life over the last 14 months!<br/>

&gt; The question that would raise it's head in my mind is -- are you only going <br/>
&gt; in search of these types of boxes yourself?  If you're going around finding <br/>
&gt; boxes placed by folks who aren't playing at your lofty level, it might be a bit <br/>
&gt; polite to place a few boxes for those folks to find in return that are more <br/>
&gt; similar to what they're placing.  We have a crew in our neck of the woods <br/>
who <br/>
&gt; *only* plants mystery boxes.  Yet they run all over searching for all the <br/>
&gt; non-mystery boxes in the area, meaning that placers who don't go in for <br/>
mystery boxes <br/>
&gt; really have nothing offered by this crew to go searching for themselves.  <br/>

<br/>
They certainly have our sympathies if someone has been "out to get them" in <br/>
the past.  Since moving to this area at the beginning of the year, I haven't <br/>
seen theft as much of a problem at all.  The only problem I've seen is with <br/>
boxes that were removed because they were on county property and the county felt <br/>
either the clues or box locations were "inappropriate."  And unfortunately, the <br/>
county went along and removed *all* boxes in a preserve even if it was only <br/>
one box they disapproved of.  I know I had to scramble and hurry to remove two <br/>
boxes we had previously planted in a preserve after the employees became angry <br/>
about another box that had been planted after ours.  I knew our boxes were <br/>
goners if I didn't quickly remove them at least temporarily.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as an "easily found password," we've attempted a few times to contact <br/>
them with what we think are the answers to their passwords.  We didn't once <br/>
receive the courtesy of a reply, not even to say "No, you're incorrect, try <br/>
again, better luck next time."  So we gave up because we have no idea whether <br/>
we're wrong, or whether they're just not into replying.  When we found their <br/>
"adopted" box, which is the only one not requiring a "password," we let them know <br/>
the date and condition, and that they replied to.  If it's only a security <br/>
matter from the past, and they've gone around finding most of our boxes this year, <br/>
you'd think we'd at least get the courtesy of *some* sort of reply.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I respecfully disagree that one should primarily look for the type of <br/>
boxes one <br/>
plants; that leads to stagnation.  Our letterboxes are enriched when we visit <br/>
a <br/>
variety of placers and a variety of types of boxes.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How does only looking primarily for the type of boxes one plants create <br/>
stagnation in a community?  It might create stagnation in that particular <br/>
individual if they allow it to, but Mr. Gates doesn't sound like the type of person who <br/>
would allow that to happent to himself.   If one were to *only* plant the <br/>
type of boxes one finds, that I could see as stagnation in a community.  Not the <br/>
other way around.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm not saying Mr. Gates should *only* plant the type of boxes already <br/>
found in his community.<br/>
<br/>
I said it might be polite to "plant a few boxes," and that "I'm just a <br/>
believer in sowing what you intend to reap -- at least a little bit."  Note the <br/>
words "few" and "a little bit."  I'm not asking any community to go stagnant.<br/>
<br/>
All I'm saying is that if he's going around finding that type of box, then, <br/>
in my opinion, it's polite to at least plant a couple of boxes that are similar <br/>
to what he's finding in appreciation towards the placers of those boxes.  <br/>
Like I said, we put ten back out in our community in appreciation (and I would by <br/>
no means expect him to place ten).  And we put a few that weren't the same. I <br/>
personally like searches that tax me physically, which the ones we've found <br/>
to date have not, so hopefully some of our future boxes will do that -- if we <br/>
can find appropriate local spots.  But we felt it would be a tad rude to not <br/>
give back a bit to the community whose boxes we've had fun finding, even it if <br/>
wasn't our *specific* cup of tea.  Note the words "a bit."  :-)  <br/>

a more experienced boxer might go home and<br/>
