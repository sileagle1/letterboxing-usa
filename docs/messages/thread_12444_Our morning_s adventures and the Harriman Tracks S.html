<br/>
It's been an interesting day thus far.  After watching the weather forecasts for a week, there seemed to be a 99% chance of having a perfect letterboxing day.  80 degrees in the mountains on a lake... four boxes for the efforts... a Dad staying home to watch the 3 yer old... what more could we ask for?<br/>
<br/>
What we got was a bright sunny 65 degrees sky turning cold and grey AND RAINY and 51 degrees in the middle of our adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully we started out backwares with box #5... Thank Heavans!  We found what we believe to be the Rock shelter, but we couldn't find the box.  By this time, the pitter patter of a few raindrop filtering thought the trees turned quicky in to a torrential downpour.  Not to be defeated, all but one of the kids took to the Rock Shelter While the two moms kept looking.  After getting soaked to the skivvies and no box, we admitted defeat.<br/>
<br/>
I truly believe we were with in 10 or so feet from that blasted box!  Now that we are back home and dry, the sun is beginning to come out!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
We headed back up to Vanderbilt to replace the box there for an out of town owner. <br/>
<br/>
We will persevere!!<br/>
<br/>
I would however, like to talk to the owner to see if the box is really not there (is that appropriate?)<br/>
