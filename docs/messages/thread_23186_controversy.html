                    <div class="plaintext-content">   I like the web site as it is with the exception of the back button <br/>
takes you to the top of the page rather that to the exact place you <br/>
were viewing.  ( I use Firefox)  I.E. reading clues and then clicking <br/>
back and having to scroll back down.<br/>
<br/>
   I notice a lot of dead page links while looking into letterboxing in <br/>
general plus many articles are 2 or more years old as was the 'Time' <br/>
article I kept on my desk and kept ignoring until now. I don't see the <br/>
value in another site to scatter the folks about.   Any hint of a <br/>
decline in this activity or is there just not enough new <br/>
'advertisement'?<br/>
<br/>
    I'm new at letter boxing with about 40 boxes found this month.   <br/>
I've found two Geocaches in that time, one being directly under a <br/>
letterbox.  I intend to get a GPS within a couple months and will also <br/>
try that hobby as well, but carving the stamp is the bonus I like best.<br/>
<br/>
   While I haven't had the experience of either good nor bad with <br/>
cachers that seems to be mentioned here, I have noticed the bad <br/>
re-hiding habits of a few I've been stamping in behind lately plus a <br/>
rash of missing boxes (about 30-40% are missing).  I'd certainly be <br/>
upset if my carved theme stamp gets taken by a Geocacher by mistake.  <br/>
Any hint that folks (kids) read the clues and take the boxes on <br/>
purpose?    Or poor placement...Box behind rock in wall next to park <br/>
duck pond...kid wants something to throw in water..finds box.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By the way to the earlier question...'Blog' is a contraction of 'Web <br/>
Log'.<br/>

  Me  too. I really like both past times but I prefer the stamp (of  letterboxing) to the trinkets (of geocaching). The creativity involved  in letterboxing appeals to me.<br/>

  In my experience it's poor placement. In my case, the boxes I've lost I'm very certain were found by kids. In my 4 years of hiding letterboxes, I've  never had a geocacher remove/trade a stamp from one of my boxes.   My geocache page explains what geocaching is and in bold red writing a  ask people not to take the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
  Rick in Boca has put some very informative files in the Files section  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/files/Lost%20Box%20Survey/<br/>
  He did a lost box survey and summarizes the results and offers  suggestions as to hide a box so it's less likely to be discovered by  non-boxers.<br/>

  Ooops. Of course I meant "...explains what letterboxing is" not geocaching. <br/>
