boxes when we come down for our annual charter sail maybe isn't the <br/>
great idea I had thought it was.<br/>

Does anyone have input on the "safety" of Letterboxes in the Punta <br/>
Gorda / Ft. Meyers area?  We chater out of Burnt Store (Charlotte <br/>
harbor) and Bindle Bum and I were thinking of leaving a few boxes <br/>
behind.<br/>
