                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good morning to all! Fall continues glorious in southern New England,<br/>
although much of the color is carelessly scattered on the trails, as<br/>
though a reckless prodigal had swept through with a rash slovenliness.<br/>
Huge winds rush over the rounded hills, brushing above the dry and<br/>
leafless branches like a river.<br/>
<br/>
While planes fall out of the sky on the coast, we've been hiking deep<br/>
into the woods to seed treasures near glacial erratics with sneaky-boxy<br/>
smiles on children's faces. This week's new crop has names like<br/>
Quonochontaug, Narragansett Ledges, Green Falls Pond, and Tribal<br/>
Nation. See them on our site at http://members.aol.com/drewclan/whatsne<br/>
w.htm and, please, come pay them a visit!<br/>
<br/>
(Aside to Tom: I've been fiddling with a map and hope to have it up<br/>
where you can see it soon.)<br/>

I can't get to this one either.  Is it me, or is it part of the puzzle? :-)<br/>
I still cannot get to any of them from the maps either.  For some reason <br/>
I thought this problem was ironed out awhile back, and I guess I never<br/>
understood what the problem was in the first place, but no one else seems<br/>
to be having it.  Drew, is it possible for you to just e-mail me your clues<br/>
before this weekend, since I prolly will never be able to get them off the<br/>
web.<br/>
<br/>
Still just confused as usual :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thx,<br/>
