                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hearing about problems with animals and in some cases weather, I cant <br/>
help wonder why alternatives to plastic boxes aren't mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
Rock climbers who leave registers on summits tend to favor tubes or <br/>
ammunition cases.  Tubes I realize would not be practical for <br/>
maintaining neat notebooks, but rectangular ammunition cases are <br/>
weatherproof, animal proof, and usually have a way for potentially <br/>
being anchored in place.<br/>
<br/>
  I have priced them but I thingk they're pretty cheap at army <br/>
surplus stores.  Just buying one and knowing I wasn't contributing to <br/>
chewed up tupperware being scattered in the woods makes it seem <br/>
worthwhile to me.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I first heard about letterboxing, my initial thought was of ammo <br/>
cans. I was actually surprised by the first one we found ("oh, cool, <br/>
Rubbermaid!" followed by "oh, cool, an eraser!!").<br/>
<br/>
Ammo cans are not as inexpensive as the plastic containers, though, at <br/>
least around here. A lot of the ones in army surplus stores no longer <br/>
maintain enough integrity to be assuredly waterproof (gaskets missing, <br/>
rusty, etc.). Also, I haven't seen ammo cans as small as a sandwich <br/>
box, and stashing a can meant to hold 105 cal. .50 rounds is no easy <br/>
task.<br/>
<br/>
If you find such suitable cans, and can afford them, go for it!!<br/>

Rite in the Rain paper is excellent waterproof paper<br/>
(www.riteintherain.com). I was worried about whether stamp ink would work on<br/>

I correspond in several different communities.  I understand the <br/>
advantages of the clear plastic in helping people know that the <br/>
contents are safe.  The same sort of safety can usually be <br/>
accomplished (As pointed out by Jeremy Irish) by clearly putting your <br/>
name and phone number on the outside of a box.   <br/>
<br/>
Just to be contrarian, my buddies in Trout Fishing would be concerned <br/>
about all of us putting plastic out in the woods.  Most of these <br/>
plastics, if not out in UV sunlight, may last for well over a <br/>
thousand years.  Metal paint cans and ammo boxes will likely be gone <br/>
in a hundred years or less.  So the metal boxes will clean themselves <br/>
up if abandoned in a much shorter time period.  Gives one pause to <br/>
think about what sort of box one should leave if on vacation or a <br/>
trip and the letterboxer has no real intent to ever go back and <br/>
remove the box.<br/>

I know of an ammo box on a rock exposed to elements<br/>
for 19 years now with no appreciable rust.  It may<br/>
well be older than that, but the first time I saw it<br/>
was 1981.<br/>
This is in Virginia, hardly an arid climate.<br/>
<br/>
When I camped in Joshua Tree, we found all sorts of<br/>
random plastic items chewed and scattered out in the<br/>
sage brush, some that had no association to food at<br/>
all.  Apparently the coyotes just found them<br/>
interesting toys.  I don't know how other animals<br/>
feel.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to think of ontributing to litter.  Seems like<br/>
a metal box is either there serving it's purpose, or<br/>
is removed.  Hate to think of torn tupperware,<br/>
notebook, inked stamp pad all becoming remote litter.<br/>

I use: Oxford spiral bound index card deck for log book.  I seal the <br/>
pages where I stamp the letterbox stamp and the introductory page <br/>
with my own stamped image with adhesive mylar tape.  Tupperware for <br/>
the container.  One small ziplock bag for the log book and pen only.  <br/>
One small ziplock bag for the stamp and ink pad only.  Put both in <br/>
one huge ziplock bag, then insert into letterbox.  Works great, even <br/>
in rain and snow.<br/>
<br/>
I always carry with me a supermarket plastic bag for trash pickup <br/>
around the site, as well as a small supply of small/large ziplock <br/>
bags for letterboxes that I find that are protected only by a <br/>
tupperware container.  (Is this acceptable protocol?)<br/>

&gt; would think so, at least here in New England.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But then again, I don't know what these new fangled metals are made<br/>
&gt; of .... could they be rustproof?<br/>

&gt; I hate to think of ontributing to litter.  Seems like<br/>
&gt; a metal box is either there serving it's purpose, or<br/>
&gt; is removed.  Hate to think of torn tupperware,<br/>
&gt; notebook, inked stamp pad all becoming remote litter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Precisely the reason why I check on the letterboxes I plant every few <br/>
months.<br/>

regardless of the outside container, the key to dry is individual <br/>
ziplock bags for each item in the container. I carry extra bags so I <br/>
can replace bags that no longer seal well. The bag containing the log <br/>
book seems to be the most vulnerable to damage since they <br/>
usually 'just fit'.<br/>
I have come across a Rubbermaid container immersed in water, with <br/>
water inside the container, but the contents were dry due to the <br/>
ziplock bags.<br/>

&gt; Rock climbers who leave registers on summits tend to favor tubes or <br/>
