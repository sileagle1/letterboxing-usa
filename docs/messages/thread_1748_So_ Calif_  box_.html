<div>SHORE BIRD BOX, BOLSA CHICA ECOLOGICAL RESERVE, 
PLACED 1/13/01</div>
<div>HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Start at the parking lot located on north side of 
Pacific Coast Highway between Huntington Beach and Sunset Beach. Take wooden 
foot bridge north.  The path will head in a westerly direction after the 
bridge.  Follow path to the end of the loop trail.  At the end you 
will see a rise with palm trees and an interpretive area.  Walk up to this 
area.  Just past the former gun emplacements you will find a vertical 
interpretive sign near marker 17.  Starting at the corner of the peeler 
core fence, count 33 vertical fence posts along path.  You will be on a 
heading on a line at 320 deg.  At the 33rd fence post (it was the last one 
there on 1/13/01), line up the 33rd post with the nearest palm tree.  At 7 
paces on this line (80 deg.) you will find a large bush.  At approximately 
1 pace inside the foliage,  the box will be found  hidden by 
palm frond parts.    You will see other hikers in this very 
popular spot so choose your search time carefully. </div>

<div>Background:  This hike is very easy.  Bird watching is 
excellent.  This area has gone through various phases over the years.  
Indian artifacts have been found.  Henry Huntington and Associates had a 
duck and gun club on the bluff , then oil was discovered and made the gun club 
members very wealthy.  During WWII shore artillery was located on 
bluff, now the area enjoys protected status.   </div></body></html>
