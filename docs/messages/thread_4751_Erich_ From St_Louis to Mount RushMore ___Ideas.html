   Since we are heading to the Black Hills area we will most likely pass <br/>
through Nebraska on our way there and back.<br/>
   Any letterboxing suggestions or other good stops?  We are very museum, <br/>
history, nature &amp; fossil oriented.  :o)<br/>

Thanks so much!<br/>

I checked out your website ...very nice.  Looks like there are a few geocache <br/>
&amp; letterbox choices.  Any suggestions for my slow moving (investigate every <br/>
nook-n-crany &amp; jump in the poison ivy when I can) 9 year old boy.<br/>

     What route are you planning on taking? Will you be coming past the Omaha <br/>
area?<br/>

<p>Mohmers,</p>
<p>     Between Scott Redd and myself there are five boxes in Nebraska, and now thanks to Funhog there are a total of nine. When are you traveling? I am planing on placing a couple more very shortly so there may be more by the time you come through.</p>
<p>     On another note, one place that you must stop and see if you are interested in fossils and such is the Ash Fall Fossil Beds in north east Nebraska. Found by a University of Nebraska proffesor in the 70's or 80's (I can't remember wich), it is a truely amazing sight! Not to be missed. You can stand there and watch as the palentologists work unearthing countless numbers of full skeletons. I hope you have a good trip. I look forward to seeing your stamps in the boxes around here. Have fun!</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks for the kind words about my site. The Jewel Park is definately not a quick find. However, Scott's two Omaha boxes would be a great time. Also, as I said I will be planting a couple more soon that will be more finder friendly.<br/><br/></p></div>

think Mount Rushmore opens to public on May 1.<br/>
<br/>
We probably will pass thru MO, e &amp; n nebraska &amp; sw South Dakota.  But that's <br/>
not final as I don't have it mapped out yet. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info!!!!!  We will definately look into ASH Falls!<br/>
