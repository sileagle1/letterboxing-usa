                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't think there are any rules. Hitchhikers move from box to <br/>
box; their logbooks bear the stamps of all the boxes they have <br/>
visited.  Sometimes the finders stamp in the HH logbook as well.  <br/>
If you don't know when you will next find a box, you are free to <br/>
leave the HH there for someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Some people bring HHs they haven't yet moved to a new box to <br/>
letterboxing gatherings.  You can get quite a lot of HH images in <br/>
your logbook at letterboxing events.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A few guidelines I like to follow for hitchhikers (merely my<br/>
suggestions - you can take them or leave them)<br/>
1) Keep them moving. If you're not going to get to another box for a<br/>
bit, leave them there or give them to someone who is. Also, try to<br/>
place them in a letterbox that gets a decent amount of traffic not one<br/>
that gets only a few visitors a year.<br/>
2) If the owner provides contact info, let them know you've found it.<br/>
I personally like to know where my hitchhikers have been and where<br/>
they currently are. You could also post it's travels to Wanda and<br/>
Pete's hitchhiker website or send a note to the travellers listserve.<br/>
3) You can post where you found the hitchhiker, but don't post where<br/>
you left it. Some people do post a general area they left it in (i.e.<br/>
western NH), but others don't even like this much information given out.<br/>
4) Be sure to "cross-stamp" the hitchhiker with the letterbox you<br/>
place it in. The hitchhiker image should appear in the letterbox log<br/>
and the letterbox image should appear in the hitchhiker log with, both<br/>
with the date. Also, before removing a hitchhiker check to be sure the<br/>
person who dropped it off remembered to "cross-stamp" and do so if<br/>
they forgot to.<br/>
5) Repair any ripped baggies and replace any overly-inky paper towels<br/>
that the stamp is wrapped in before placing it out to ensure it is<br/>
well protected.<br/>
That's about all I can think of at the moment. Hope that helps. Again,<br/>
these are merely suggestions.<br/>
