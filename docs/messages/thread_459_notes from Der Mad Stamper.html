lately, I've hardly had time to sleep!!!  Hope you all missed me!!!<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I want to send a great big THANK YOU out to Deborah.  She found <br/>
a wonderful book on rebuses, and remembered that I like to use my stamps to <br/>
make these word puzzles, so she sent me a copy.  It was a wonderful thing to <br/>
do, and made my day when I found it in the mail!!!  Thanks, Deborah, you're <br/>
one in a million!!!<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, I've been too busy to get any new boxes placed, even though I have <br/>
the stamps carved and ready.  Glad to hear that Cara made it to Portland and <br/>
found several Rock Creek boxes!!  I can't wait to go out and see her entries.<br/>
<br/>
I hesitate to even comment on the art ownership issue... what a mess!!  This <br/>
kind of petty disagreement hurts us all.  Like the vast majority of people <br/>
who have responded, I think it is best to include a short reminder on the <br/>
website (one time only, not on each page) that the content of the site is not <br/>
to be reproduced or altered without express permission unless it's for <br/>
personal use.  I could care less how it is actually worded, but something to <br/>
that effect should be included.  We are providing clues, not clip-art.  The <br/>
majority has spoken, so this should no longer be an issue... right, Dan?<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations to Eric Mings for putting Florida on the map.  I am very <br/>
happy to see his clues on the website.<br/>
<br/>
Dan, I believe I've corrected the problem with having extra space above the <br/>
masthead.  There was a blank space character (Â  in HTML) inserted in <br/>
between the <body...> statement and the <center>  Probably a side effect of <br/>
your web publishing software.<br/>
<br/>
Let's see... did I forget anything?  I've been out of touch for too long... <br/>
I'll try not to let that happen again.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing to All,<br/>
Mitch, Der Mad Stamper<br/>
