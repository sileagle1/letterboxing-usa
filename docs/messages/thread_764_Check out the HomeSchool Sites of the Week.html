 Hail &amp; Farewell<br/>
     The time has come for me to say farewell to Homeschool Connection. After<br/>
 a holiday vacation, I will take up my new responsibilities as Forum Leader in<br/>
 the Families Community. This past year has been one of excitement and growth<br/>
 for both Homeschool Connection and homeschooling across the country. My wish<br/>
 for you is that the first decade of the new century bring as much...and<br/>
 more... growth to homeschooling as this last decade in the old one.<br/>
     May you and yours have a safe and happy holiday season, however and<br/>
 whatever it is you choose to celebrate. And may the year 2000 bring you<br/>
 personal joy, peace and happiness.<br/>
 MissPatC<br/>
 former Forum Manager<br/>
 Homeschool Connection<br/>
 Families Channel<br/>
<br/>
 Hello From the New Forum Leader<br/>
     During this time of the year, thoughts turn to family and spending time<br/>
 with them.  Family is very important to most homeschoolers and I am no<br/>
 exception.  I am a wife and mother of three kids.  My oldest is almost 17 and<br/>
 is the typical teenager, wants to have a good time.  My 9 year old is the<br/>
 sensitive one of the group but very energetic also.  The baby is not much of<br/>
 a baby at almost 5 but he definitely knows how to wrap me around his little<br/>
 finger.<br/>
     I enjoy spending quiet times having a nice dinner with family and<br/>
 friends.  Yeah, I know, sounds mushy doesn't it.  But everytime I think of<br/>
 the Homeschool Connection Forum, I think of family and friends.  Family is<br/>
 very important to most homeschoolers and the volunteers here at Homeschool<br/>
 Connection are no exception.<br/>
     For those of you that I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting, I have<br/>
 volunteered my time in the Homeschool Connection Forum as a Chat Host, Chat<br/>
 Host Team Leader, and Assistant Forum Manager.  Through the different duties<br/>
 that I have had, I have had the opportunity to meet many wonderful people and<br/>
 hopefully helped a few.<br/>
     As the Homeschool Connection Forum Leader, my greatest wish is that I can<br/>
 draw on my business background to fulfill the duties such as paperwork and<br/>
 other management tasks, while drawing on my active homeschooling parent side<br/>
 to find the ways that I can best help the forum and enable it to help other<br/>
 homeschoolers as much as it has helped me.<br/>
     As we go into the new year, Homeschool Connection shows promise of<br/>
 growing more and helping even more homeschoolers.  This continued growth will<br/>
 mean that as Homeschool Connection continues to grow, it must also adapt to<br/>
 the needs of homeschoolers.<br/>
     As Forum Leader, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the<br/>
 volunteers who give of their time, energy, and heart to help, and the many<br/>
 members that come share in the wealth of knowledge available right here on<br/>
 Homeschool Connection.  Without the help of each and every one of you, this<br/>
 forum could not be what it is today.<br/>
     Although the Homeschool Connection forum is far from boring, the new year<br/>
 promises to be filled with opportunities for more growth, learning<br/>
 experiences, and fun!!  Although I will not be doing regular chats any<br/>
 longer, you will occasionally see me in a chat or posting on a message board.<br/>
  I will be available via e-mail to help if you should have a question,<br/>
 comment, or suggestion.  I look forward to reading your e-mails!!<br/>
     I hope this holiday season finds you with the ones that you love and a<br/>
 light, warm heart!!  Good luck Homeschooling and feel free to e-mail me<br/>
 sometime.<br/>

 Holiday School<br/>
     A friend of mine does something called "Christmas School"  It began when<br/>
 year after year, for the month of December, she would say, "no school this<br/>
 month" because of all of her commitments as a pastor's wife and now a<br/>
 military chaplain's wife and mother of a large family.  Her husband pointed<br/>
 out, and rightly so, that they do "school" but just not traditional stuff<br/>
 during December so why not "count" it too?  I thought I would share it with<br/>
 you folks.  Maybe you can take her ideas and make them fit into your family<br/>
 and lifestyle.<br/>
    The house if filled with music, since many of her children play<br/>
 instruments.  They pick out all the "holiday" stuff and play and play.  They<br/>
 have holiday videos that are kept away until this time of year.  We do this<br/>
 too, and one of my favorites is "It's a Wonderful Life" with Jimmy Stewart.<br/>
 I love the oldies.  I have "Miracle on 34th Street"  old and new versions.<br/>
 "White Christmas" with Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye and "Holiday Inn" with Bing<br/>
 Crosby and Fred Astaire.  I am a sucker for AMC and Turner Classics this time<br/>
 of year.  Ok.. I liked the Santa Clause with Tim Allen and I like some of<br/>
 other newer movies too..<br/>
      She has a ton of Christmas books and she wraps them all individually.<br/>
 Each night starting at the first advent Sunday her children take turns and<br/>
 pick a wrapped book.  That is their reading together that night.<br/>
     They host a cookie exchange where each person brings a dozen cookies per<br/>
 participant.  You then each get a dozen of different kinds of cookies for the<br/>
 holidays.  I hope she shares recipes too!!  Her children bake and help host<br/>
 the party!  Again, great skills for the future.<br/>
     I hope to add to her "Christmas School" this year by hosting a<br/>
 gingerbread house party at my house.  I am going to send an invitation to a<br/>
 couple of homeschooling families with the directions to make the sides and<br/>
 pieces of a ginger bread house.  They can come with as many houses as they<br/>
 want assemble but they have to bring the candy to go on them too...a bag per<br/>
 child.  I will provide the icing and the huge dining room table covered in<br/>
 plastic.  (ok, and some candy too.. LOL).  Hopefully we will all end up with<br/>
 a fairly normal looking gingerbread house.<br/>
     Don't forget crafts too!  There are tons of things that you can make for<br/>
 the holidays.  I saw something great for children-- making  Chanukah candles<br/>
 for the menorrah.  What about tree ornaments?  We have made peppermint mice,<br/>
 peppermint reindeer and other great ornaments.  I have found tons of ideas on<br/>
 the web.  Make a cloth nativity. The options are limitless.<br/>
     What can you do?  If you are from a different religion how about a<br/>
 Chanukah or a Kwanzaa month?  If the religious aspect is not your thing, then<br/>
 what about a "service" month, where you focus on doing things for others?<br/>
 There are so many options out there for the month of December!<br/>
     I really appreciate my friends the Klines.  We were all living in Panama<br/>
 and they invited us to their home for a Chanukah celebration.  They taught my<br/>
 then five year old daughter to spin a dreidel and I tasted the best food in<br/>
 my life.  Cabbage rolls, potato latkes and cholent.  My mouth is watering<br/>
 thinking of it!  Maybe you can share something special your family does with<br/>
 others.  We plan to invite my husband's office over for a chili luncheon one<br/>
 day next month.  One family I know of sings at a nursing home each week<br/>
 during the holidays.<br/>
    What can you do?  Only our own imagination can limit you!<br/>

 Homeschool Sites of the Week<br/>
 Just click here<br/>
<a href="aol://4344:1595.hmscres.12321817.607788171">Homeschool Resource<br/>
 Center</a><br/>
 and open the file in the box on the right hand side of the screen entitled<br/>
 Homeschooling Sites of the Week. You'll find links to all this week's<br/>
 fantastic Homeschool Sites of the Week and more.<br/>
<br/>
 Letterboxing<br/>
 It is a map learning skill/hobby that one of our readers has been sharing<br/>
 with her kids and others in their homeschooling group.  The first two sites<br/>
 explain the hobby in detail and also provide maps for the hobby.  Her kids<br/>
 love it ... they can look for a hidden treasure and learn how to follow a<br/>
 compass and read a map and work together at the same time.  There are<br/>
 "letterboxes" hidden on Liberty Island New York; at Valley Forge and<br/>
 Washington DC and all the way around the world. This sounds like a great<br/>
 combination of geography, map skills and things to do when traveling!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Lots of resources for teachers!<br/>
 This site is packed with links for other sites for lesson plans, virtual<br/>
 field trips, theory, stock market strategy games and links to more sites with<br/>
 even more resources. This is a definate Favorite Place!<br/>
<br/>
 Vexillology<br/>
 When you find a dictionary that has a definition for that word, buy it!<br/>
 Anyway, this site is dedicated to vexillology and I'm not going to tell you<br/>
 what it is! You'll have to see for yourself :)<br/>
<br/>
 How to Do Math in Your Head<br/>
 Here's a site with tips for multiplying, dividing and doing math in your head<br/>
 faster than a calculator!<br/>
<br/>
 Spelling and word games<br/>
 These sites are fun to try (if only once)...They are Japanese sites designed<br/>
 for persons learning English. There are Hangman games, a sentence building<br/>
 game (it isn't very sophisticated, but when you complete the sentence it<br/>
 gives you the Japanese translation in our alphabet). Another is a bingo type<br/>
 game.<br/>
<br/>
 Holiday Celebrations Around the World<br/>
 This site offers recipes galore and links to other sites where you can learn<br/>
 about holidays celebrated in other countries.<br/>
<br/>
 Ecology site<br/>
 This site was created by a group of high school students. It features links<br/>
 to various sites for marine biology, El Nino and La Nina, Environmental<br/>
 Science, Lunar Tides, and a whole lot more.<br/>
<br/>
 Christmas Crafts<br/>
 For kids and adults for your decorating and gift giving and just plain<br/>
 enjoying :)<br/>

****************************************************************<br/>
Have you ever wondered about heaven and what the "entrance requirements" are? <br/>
There are many theories but you can find out for yourself what the Bible <br/>
says.  These are just a few passages that explain God's plan:<br/>
     Acts 2:36-40        Romans 10:14-17     Matt 10:32-33<br/>
     Romans 10:9-10   Acts 8:34-38            Acts 2:38<br/>
     Matt 28:19-20       Mark 16:16              Acts 22:16<br/>
     1 Peter 3:21<br/>
How do you do that? These passages are good examples of how:<br/>
      Acts 2:36-38;   Romans 6:1-5;  Ephesians 2:19;  Acts 2:46-47<br/>
Then: Eph 2:4-5;  2 Cor 5:14-17  &amp; Romans 8:12-14; Eph 4:16<br/>
On that last day you can claim your reward: Romans 8:18<br/>
<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Hello From the New Forum Leader<br/>
&gt;      During this time of the year, thoughts turn to family and <br/>
spending time<br/>
&gt;  with them.  Family is very important to most homeschoolers and I <br/>
am no<br/>
&gt;  exception.  I am a wife and mother of three kids.  My oldest is <br/>
almost 17 and<br/>
&gt;  is the typical teenager, wants to have a good time.  My 9 year old <br/>
is the<br/>
&gt;  sensitive one of the group but very energetic also.  The baby is <br/>
not much of<br/>
&gt;  a baby at almost 5 but he definitely knows how to wrap me around <br/>
his little<br/>
&gt;  finger.<br/>
&gt;      I enjoy spending quiet times having a nice dinner with family <br/>
and<br/>
&gt;  friends.  Yeah, I know, sounds mushy doesn't it.  But everytime I <br/>
think of<br/>
&gt;  the Homeschool Connection Forum, I think of family and friends.  <br/>
Family is<br/>
&gt;  very important to most homeschoolers and the volunteers here at <br/>
Homeschool<br/>
&gt;  Connection are no exception.<br/>
&gt;      For those of you that I have not yet had the pleasure of <br/>
meeting, I have<br/>
&gt;  volunteered my time in the Homeschool Connection Forum as a Chat <br/>
Host, Chat<br/>
&gt;  Host Team Leader, and Assistant Forum Manager.  Through the <br/>
different duties<br/>
&gt;  that I have had, I have had the opportunity to meet many wonderful <br/>
people and<br/>
&gt;  hopefully helped a few.<br/>
&gt;      As the Homeschool Connection Forum Leader, my greatest wish is <br/>
that I can<br/>
&gt;  draw on my business background to fulfill the duties such as <br/>
paperwork and<br/>
&gt;  other management tasks, while drawing on my active homeschooling <br/>
parent side<br/>
&gt;  to find the ways that I can best help the forum and enable it to <br/>
help other<br/>
&gt;  homeschoolers as much as it has helped me.<br/>
&gt;      As we go into the new year, Homeschool Connection shows <br/>
promise of<br/>
&gt;  growing more and helping even more homeschoolers.  This continued <br/>
growth will<br/>
&gt;  mean that as Homeschool Connection continues to grow, it must also <br/>
adapt to<br/>
&gt;  the needs of homeschoolers.<br/>
&gt;      As Forum Leader, I would like to take this opportunity to <br/>
thank the<br/>
&gt;  volunteers who give of their time, energy, and heart to help, and <br/>
the many<br/>
&gt;  members that come share in the wealth of knowledge available right <br/>
here on<br/>
&gt;  Homeschool Connection.  Without the help of each and every one of <br/>
you, this<br/>
&gt;  forum could not be what it is today.<br/>
&gt;      Although the Homeschool Connection forum is far from boring, <br/>
the new year<br/>
&gt;  promises to be filled with opportunities for more growth, learning<br/>
&gt;  experiences, and fun!!  Although I will not be doing regular chats <br/>
any<br/>
&gt;  longer, you will occasionally see me in a chat or posting on a <br/>
message board.<br/>
&gt;   I will be available via e-mail to help if you should have a <br/>
question,<br/>
&gt;  comment, or suggestion.  I look forward to reading your e-mails!!<br/>
&gt;      I hope this holiday season finds you with the ones that you <br/>
love and a<br/>
&gt;  light, warm heart!!  Good luck Homeschooling and feel free to e-<br/>
mail me<br/>
&gt;  sometime.<br/>

&gt;  Holiday School<br/>
&gt;      A friend of mine does something called "Christmas School"  It <br/>
began when<br/>
&gt;  year after year, for the month of December, she would say, "no <br/>
school this<br/>
&gt;  month" because of all of her commitments as a pastor's wife and <br/>
now a<br/>
&gt;  military chaplain's wife and mother of a large family.  Her <br/>
husband pointed<br/>
&gt;  out, and rightly so, that they do "school" but just not <br/>
traditional stuff<br/>
&gt;  during December so why not "count" it too?  I thought I would <br/>
share it with<br/>
&gt;  you folks.  Maybe you can take her ideas and make them fit into <br/>
your family<br/>
&gt;  and lifestyle.<br/>
&gt;     The house if filled with music, since many of her children play<br/>
&gt;  instruments.  They pick out all the "holiday" stuff and play and <br/>
play.  They<br/>
&gt;  have holiday videos that are kept away until this time of year.  <br/>
We do this<br/>
&gt;  too, and one of my favorites is "It's a Wonderful Life" with Jimmy <br/>
Stewart.<br/>
&gt;  I love the oldies.  I have "Miracle on 34th Street"  old and new <br/>
versions.<br/>
&gt;  "White Christmas" with Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye and "Holiday <br/>
Inn" with Bing<br/>
&gt;  Crosby and Fred Astaire.  I am a sucker for AMC and Turner <br/>
Classics this time<br/>
&gt;  of year.  Ok.. I liked the Santa Clause with Tim Allen and I like <br/>
some of<br/>
&gt;  other newer movies too..<br/>
&gt;       She has a ton of Christmas books and she wraps them all <br/>
individually.<br/>
&gt;  Each night starting at the first advent Sunday her children take <br/>
turns and<br/>
&gt;  pick a wrapped book.  That is their reading together that night.<br/>
&gt;      They host a cookie exchange where each person brings a dozen <br/>
cookies per<br/>
&gt;  participant.  You then each get a dozen of different kinds of <br/>
cookies for the<br/>
&gt;  holidays.  I hope she shares recipes too!!  Her children bake and <br/>
help host<br/>
&gt;  the party!  Again, great skills for the future.<br/>
&gt;      I hope to add to her "Christmas School" this year by hosting a<br/>
&gt;  gingerbread house party at my house.  I am going to send an <br/>
invitation to a<br/>
&gt;  couple of homeschooling families with the directions to make the <br/>
sides and<br/>
&gt;  pieces of a ginger bread house.  They can come with as many houses <br/>
as they<br/>
&gt;  want assemble but they have to bring the candy to go on them <br/>
too...a bag per<br/>
&gt;  child.  I will provide the icing and the huge dining room table <br/>
covered in<br/>
&gt;  plastic.  (ok, and some candy too.. LOL).  Hopefully we will all <br/>
end up with<br/>
&gt;  a fairly normal looking gingerbread house.<br/>
&gt;      Don't forget crafts too!  There are tons of things that you <br/>
can make for<br/>
&gt;  the holidays.  I saw something great for children-- making  <br/>
Chanukah candles<br/>
&gt;  for the menorrah.  What about tree ornaments?  We have made <br/>
peppermint mice,<br/>
&gt;  peppermint reindeer and other great ornaments.  I have found tons <br/>
of ideas on<br/>
&gt;  the web.  Make a cloth nativity. The options are limitless.<br/>
&gt;      What can you do?  If you are from a different religion how <br/>
about a<br/>
&gt;  Chanukah or a Kwanzaa month?  If the religious aspect is not your <br/>
thing, then<br/>
&gt;  what about a "service" month, where you focus on doing things for <br/>
others?<br/>
&gt;  There are so many options out there for the month of December!<br/>
&gt;      I really appreciate my friends the Klines.  We were all living <br/>
in Panama<br/>
&gt;  and they invited us to their home for a Chanukah celebration.  <br/>
They taught my<br/>
&gt;  then five year old daughter to spin a dreidel and I tasted the <br/>
best food in<br/>
&gt;  my life.  Cabbage rolls, potato latkes and cholent.  My mouth is <br/>
watering<br/>
&gt;  thinking of it!  Maybe you can share something special your family <br/>
does with<br/>
&gt;  others.  We plan to invite my husband's office over for a chili <br/>
luncheon one<br/>
&gt;  day next month.  One family I know of sings at a nursing home each <br/>
week<br/>
&gt;  during the holidays.<br/>
&gt;     What can you do?  Only our own imagination can limit you!<br/>

&gt;  Letterboxing<br/>
&gt;  It is a map learning skill/hobby that one of our readers has been <br/>
sharing<br/>
&gt;  with her kids and others in their homeschooling group.  The first <br/>
two sites<br/>
&gt;  explain the hobby in detail and also provide maps for the hobby.  <br/>
Her kids<br/>
&gt;  love it ... they can look for a hidden treasure and learn how to <br/>
follow a<br/>
&gt;  compass and read a map and work together at the same time.  There <br/>
are<br/>
&gt;  "letterboxes" hidden on Liberty Island New York; at Valley Forge <br/>
and<br/>
&gt;  Washington DC and all the way around the world. This sounds like a <br/>
great<br/>
&gt;  combination of geography, map skills and things to do when <br/>
traveling!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Lots of resources for teachers!<br/>
&gt;  This site is packed with links for other sites for lesson plans, <br/>
virtual<br/>
&gt;  field trips, theory, stock market strategy games and links to more <br/>
sites with<br/>
&gt;  even more resources. This is a definate Favorite Place!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Vexillology<br/>
&gt;  When you find a dictionary that has a definition for that word, <br/>
buy it!<br/>
&gt;  Anyway, this site is dedicated to vexillology and I'm not going to <br/>
tell you<br/>
&gt;  what it is! You'll have to see for yourself :)<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  How to Do Math in Your Head<br/>
&gt;  Here's a site with tips for multiplying, dividing and doing math <br/>
in your head<br/>
&gt;  faster than a calculator!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Spelling and word games<br/>
&gt;  These sites are fun to try (if only once)...They are Japanese <br/>
sites designed<br/>
&gt;  for persons learning English. There are Hangman games, a sentence <br/>
building<br/>
&gt;  game (it isn't very sophisticated, but when you complete the <br/>
sentence it<br/>
&gt;  gives you the Japanese translation in our alphabet). Another is a <br/>
bingo type<br/>
&gt;  game.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Holiday Celebrations Around the World<br/>
&gt;  This site offers recipes galore and links to other sites where you <br/>
can learn<br/>
&gt;  about holidays celebrated in other countries.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Ecology site<br/>

features links<br/>
&gt;  to various sites for marine biology, El Nino and La Nina, <br/>
Environmental<br/>
&gt;  Science, Lunar Tides, and a whole lot more.<br/>

&gt; Have you ever wondered about heaven and what the "entrance <br/>
requirements" are? <br/>
&gt; There are many theories but you can find out for yourself what the <br/>
Bible <br/>
&gt; says.  These are just a few passages that explain God's plan:<br/>
&gt;      Acts 2:36-40        Romans 10:14-17     Matt 10:32-33<br/>
&gt;      Romans 10:9-10   Acts 8:34-38            Acts 2:38<br/>
&gt;      Matt 28:19-20       Mark 16:16              Acts 22:16<br/>
&gt;      1 Peter 3:21<br/>
&gt; How do you do that? These passages are good examples of how:<br/>
&gt;       Acts 2:36-38;   Romans 6:1-5;  Ephesians 2:19;  Acts 2:46-47<br/>
&gt; Then: Eph 2:4-5;  2 Cor 5:14-17  &amp; Romans 8:12-14; Eph 4:16<br/>
&gt; On that last day you can claim your reward: Romans 8:18<br/>
&gt; <br/>
