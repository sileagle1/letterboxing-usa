<div>Hi all.  It appears that my first attempt at 
planting a box has caused some confusion.  My deepest apologies to anyone 
that I put at risk of heat stroke by sending them wandering around Point Judith 
without a (decently written) clue.  After consulting with the local expert 
on confusing directions (my dad, who, in true RI tradition, likes to give 
directions based on landmarks that no longer exist, but is pretty good at 
pointing out when others have made navigational errors) I have rewritten a line 
in my clue, and added a couple of addition lines.  If anyone on the list 
should decide to give it a try, please let me know if it's still 
confusing.  I may just toss the poem and go with a straightforward "hey, 
it's over there" approach.  Or I could just let the next hurricane swell 
wash the silly thing away and no longer feel guilty about lost letterboxers 
wandering around the neighborhood... (nah...it took too long to carve the silly 
stamp to just let it float away!)  ;&gt;)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To the poor beleaguered webmaster:  I'm 
working on getting a web page set up before I plant my next box.  In the 
meantime, could you please make the changes to the poem part of the clue that 
are marked by asterisks.  This is the Point Judith Letterbox located in 
Narragansett, RI, in Washington county.  Thank you!</div>

&gt; likes to give directions based on landmarks that no longer exist<br/>
<br/>
Which is commendable.  Heck, there are clues based on landmarks that<br/>
have been gone for more than 150 years ... sort of adds to the challenge,<br/>
doesn't it :)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I may just toss the poem and go with a straightforward "hey, it's <br/>
&gt; over there" approach.  <br/>
<br/>
Which is fine when its not really over there ;-) but otherwise, obscurity<br/>
has its niche ... I vote to keep the poem. <br/>
<br/>
Now, if only I could add value to the post.  I can't, but I will say that<br/>
pandas who chase foxes should drink more coffee.<br/>
<br/>
In other news, did anyone see the article in Friday's Wall Street Journal<br/>
about a town in CT trying to extend its border into RI?  I forget the name<br/>
of the town; it was North Stonington or something like that.  Looks like<br/>
they have a pretty good case -- some people could wake up living in a new<br/>
state.  Anyway, the beleaguered webmaster may want to check boxes in this<br/>
part of the world to make sure their state isn't changing as we speak.  Now<br/>
that will be cool ... one is tempted to place a box in the affected area<br/>
before the matter is decided, especially to confuse any databases that<br/>
are deployed ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
with apologies for posting a non-functional post to the list ...<br/>

Re: directions from defunct landmarks, Randy, you beat me to the <br/>
punch (line)! I was just about to say "I know a letterboxer who does <br/>
that."<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;a town in CT trying to extend its border into RI? I forget the name<br/>
of the town; it was North Stonington or something like that. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Isn't that a classic squabble? It actually only involves several <br/>
houses in one neighborhood, but the argument is based on a bad survey <br/>
done in the 1800s by a drunken friend of the Mayor of Providence. The <br/>
big problem is the parents on one side of the line don't want to send <br/>
their kids to the school on the other side...because their soccer <br/>
team is all left feet.<br/>
<br/>
I still want to plant a box in the "notch" of land swapped between MA <br/>
and CT. <br/>
