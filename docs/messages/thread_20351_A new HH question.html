I really appeciate the current thread on HH etiquette.  I agree entirely.<br/>
<br/>
This may be quite elementary, but being new, I am unclear:  on a trip through Rockford, IL I found Jake's Third Birthday ( a neat placement in and a cut stamp).  I was second on the LB and found therein a HH - Fastener Capitol of the World - by Laughing Coyote.  I am the first to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Question - does a first found HH qualify as a FF? I'd think so, but as the intent was the other LB and I clearly wasn't first there, maybe FF is not relevant for the HH.<br/>
<br/>
Not that it matters.  The day was wonderful and as I've found, LB-ing is a great way to see the amazing gems of places a visitor never would.<br/>
<br/>
Just Curious.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as I live in MA, is there a convention regarding how long a ride is too long (distance wise) for a local HH?  <br/>

If no one has stamped the HH's logbook and you are the first to find <br/>
it -- regardless of the number of people who have found the host <br/>
letterbox -- it is a first find.  My view, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My guess is that most HH placers are hoping their boxes travel far <br/>
and wide -- no limit at all, I'd say.<br/>

I agree that most HH are meant to travel far and wide,  unless there are<br/>

I'm not too interested in FF either, but was more interested in the issue of taking aHH far afield.  The HH creator saw my posting and encouraged a long journey as long as it didn't mean a long hiatus in the backpack.  Promising that it won't, the HH is coming east.<br/>
