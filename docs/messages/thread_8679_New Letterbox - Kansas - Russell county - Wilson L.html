Planted by The Family.  Today that is JT, TT, Jammer, Squirrel the<br/>
nut and rtrw on October 5th ,2002<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty - not hard, but there's a climb<br/>
Time - 30 minutes to an hour, not including stamp in time<br/>
Directions to starting place - Make your way to the Hell Creek<br/>
Section of Wilson Lake State Park.  Pick up a map and nature trail <br/>
brochure and head to the Dakota Nature Trail. This link may help <br/>
you get a map in advance.  <br/>

Details you should know -  Der Mad Stamper's Wilson Lake Letterbox is <br/>
on this trail.  It has been in place since 1999, and we were the<br/>
first ones to stamp in.  He's a terrific carver, and more people <br/>
should go find this box.  We planted our letterbox as a tag a long on <br/>
the same trail in hopes that  if we plant them, they will<br/>
come<br/>
<br/>
Details you don't need to know, but might enjoy - We saw a small<br/>
snake there.  There are some amazing views of Lake Wilson along this <br/>
trail.  I found two round gourds here, too.  We were here on a <br/>
gorgeous windy day.  Definitely not typical Kansas views from the top.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:	Park near the restroom building and head up the trail to the <br/>
left as you face it.  There is a bench at the overlook on top of the <br/>
hill.  Either take the long trail around (my suggestion) or turn<br/>
right onto the short loop (Squirrel's idea).  Either way you will<br/>
have a chance to pick up the box.   Where the two trails meet and the <br/>
sand rocks greet (at # 11 on your map), your prize is tucked into the<br/>
rocks that look off the south.  Regarding the stamp, I now know that <br/>
bulls aren't broncs.  See what happens when a Yankee tries to plant <br/>
letterboxes in the mid west. <br/>
<br/>
Please report any box needs to rtrw@attbi.com.  This is, however, a <br/>
bit of an orphan box since I only make it out there about once a<br/>
year. If there's anything you can do to make sure the box is dry and <br/>
in ok shape, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
If anyone is going to attempt to find this box, or any of Der Mad<br/>
Stamper's boxes in northwest Kansas, could you drop me an e-mail<br/>
beforehand? I'm a reporter at the nearby daily newspaper and think<br/>
this would make a cool story if a photographer and I could follow<br/>
someone around.<br/>
