<br/>
Name of Letterbox: Dead Snellings and weeds<br/>
Placed by: Jmcc and Busszz<br/>
Date Placed: 4/8/2<br/>
City: Fredericksburg, Va.<br/>
<br/>
Description: Fredericksburg is a town full of monuments, historic <br/>
buildings, battlefields, cemetaries, museums, and antique stores. But <br/>
probably the least visited attracion in the area is the old Falmouth <br/>
Church. This is an ODD church...but I won't give details here as I do <br/>
not want to spoil the surprise for anyone who wants to locate this <br/>
letterbox....let's just say you don't see a lot of churches that are <br/>
this...sparse. This is a public/tourist area..but it doesn't get a <br/>
lot of visitors. It's a pretty place to stop for a rest<br/>
CLUE: <br/>
The church is across the Rappahanock from Fredericksburg. Cross the <br/>
river (heading north) on the Rt.1 bridge (The locals call it the <br/>
Falmouth Bridge). As you get off of the bridge the Church is up the <br/>
hill to the right (Carter St.. I think). Park in front of the chruch, <br/>
go behind the Church (where there is a cemetary with a remarkable <br/>
number of tombstones from the family Snellings).<br/>
As you stand behind the church look down towards the river (South). <br/>
At the edge of the mowed grass you'll see a pile of 5-6 large <br/>
boulders. On the downhill side of the boulders is one rock whose <br/>
shape is very rectangular. The letter box is under some weeds on the <br/>
up-hill side of the rectangular rock (Between the rectangular rock <br/>
and one of the other boulders). You should use gloves since you'll be <br/>
poking around cracks in rocks. Use care. As the waiver says...any <br/>
outdoor sports requires some degree of risk.<br/>
For those who don't know the area well: Get off of Interstate 95 at <br/>
the FALMOUTH/WARRENTON exit. Follow the signs towards Falmouth <br/>
(You'll be on Rt. 17.).<br/>
Once you cross the intersection of Rt.1 nd Rt. 17, start looking for <br/>
a street called either CARTER ST. or Rt. 2001 (It depends upon which <br/>
sign you see first). Turn right onto Carter Street and you'll see the <br/>
church.<br/>
