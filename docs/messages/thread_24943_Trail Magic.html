Putting little toys inside letterboxes you find may not be appreciated <br/>
by the Planter as it can turn them into geocaches. The stamps then can <br/>
be mistaken for geocache goodies and get removed by subsequent finders <br/>
of the toy stash.<br/>

When the weather is cool enough, I leave a Kit Kat for the first finder--fortunately I live in a state where the first finders move fairly quickly!  It's a cute idea, but I'd definitely want things to be labelled well so people don't confuse with geocaches or anything.<br/>

&gt; I like the idea! There is a real basic pure joy in discovering a "prize" in a <br/>
&gt; totally unexpected place or at atime when you are thinking of other things. <br/>
&gt; Sorta sends you off feeling extra good about life in general. In the past <br/>
&gt; (usually when I set out a new letterbox) I would occasionally include a little <br/>
&gt; gift in a baggie marked "for the first finder". Also, I like to leave little toy <br/>
&gt; prizes in some of the letterboxes we go out &amp; find. I don't do this much, just <br/>
