<br/>
With our Dartmoor trip only 7 weeks away from this Friday, a question <br/>
has come up from one of our trip members. [There are 13 of us and we <br/>
are being called the LBNA Baker's Dozen. Rustypuff is designing a <br/>
common stamp that we will use to speed up the stamping in process!]<br/>
<br/>
The question is: Can we count our Dartmoor finds in our normal F <br/>
count? I assume that with letterboxes all over the world, that a box <br/>
is a box, as long as it fits the understood criteria - clues, stamp, <br/>
logbook.<br/>
<br/>
So - what say you, letterboxing sages?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

The Dartmoor 100 Club specifically says that you can only count boxes on <br/>
Dartmoor towards your count of found Dartmoor boxes (which is important to <br/>
them because you must have found 100 before you can get their updated clue <br/>
catalogues).<br/>
<br/>
However, we North Americans tend to have a more global view of <br/>
letterboxing, and when I get to Dartmoor myself, I'll probably be inclined <br/>
to count those boxes in my total F count, barring any great upheaval of <br/>
opinions to the contrary here....<br/>
