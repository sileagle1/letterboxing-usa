Your clues sound great. I can't wait till next week-end!<br/>

&gt; Yay it's hidden!  Finally!  We couldn't find a book to fit the<br/>
&gt; container!  We were going to go home so I could make a book, but we hit<br/>
&gt; the shipping/copier shop in town instead and made a "crude" little book<br/>
&gt; out of copier paper (not acid-free!) and cardstock.  It looks a little<br/>
&gt; plain, but I stamped the front cover with the letterbox stamp.  Feel<br/>
&gt; free to add a little more decoration to it if you visit it!  We put<br/>
&gt; several copies of Erik's Letterboxing info sheet in there as well as<br/>
&gt; postcards.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Everyone go visit it before it rains and snows!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; DIRECTIONS:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;From NH Route 202 in Peterborough:  Turn onto Old Street Road towards<br/>
&gt; Monadnock Community Hospital (MCH) (turn right if you're heading north<br/>
&gt; or left if you're heading south - confused?  good, so am I!) - the road<br/>
&gt; will be steep going up - do not take Route 136 to the left.  You'll pass<br/>
&gt; MCH on your right, go south about 1/4 of a mile and you'll see Shieling<br/>
&gt; Forest on your left.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;From NH Route 101 in Peterborough:  Turn onto Old Street Road at the<br/>
&gt; intersection (opposite direction is     Rt. 123/124 towards New Ipswich)<br/>
&gt; - and follow this road past the Sand Hill Road intersection.  Shieling<br/>
&gt; Forest will be about 1/4 mile on your right.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; CLUE DIFFICULTY:  Easy<br/>
&gt; TERRAIN:  Easy<br/>
&gt; ESTABLISHED:  December 5, 1998<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; CLUES FOR THE SHIELING FOREST LETTERBOX:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Follow the "brave" path until you reach the giants of the forest.  Stand<br/>
&gt; where the two were once whole.<br/>
&gt; Walk approximately 30 paces east (more if you're vertically challenged)<br/>
&gt; to the "white pearl" in the ground.  Walk another 15 to 20 paces<br/>
&gt; southeast to a spot where three hemlocks form a triangle (approximately<br/>
&gt; 10 paces from the nearest trail).  Between rocks and a fallen tree is<br/>
&gt; the trap door to the forest floor.  Behind this door lies the letterbox<br/>
&gt; of Shieling Forest.<br/>
