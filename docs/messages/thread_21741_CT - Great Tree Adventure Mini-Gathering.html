Well ... Today was a gorgeous day for letterboxing. I took my wife<br/>
(CT_Sunflowergirl), my wifes cousin (lizzie lover), aunt (aunt sue),<br/>
and uncle (The Bronx Bomber) to The Great Tree Adventure in<br/>
Wallingford, CT. We were lucky enough to meet up with a bunch of<br/>
letterboxers including Butterfly, Sadie &amp; Russ, Sojourner, The Lady<br/>
and The Whippet, and Phynstar. It was a regular mini-gathering!<br/>
<br/>
To commemorate the event they pulled out a mini-gathering box. The<br/>
book was made with sunflowers on the cover a title that<br/>
said "Letterboxer2002 comes out of hibernation with ...<br/>
CT_Sunflowergirl!!" Ironically I had planned on carving a stamp<br/>
exactly like the gathering stamp of a sunflower with kokopelli in the<br/>
middle. It was a real treat! Kate(Lizzie Lover)loved every minute.<br/>
<br/>
I have decided that the stamp for the mini-gathering is officially my<br/>
new personal traveler and will only be given out when Amy &amp; I are<br/>
hiking together.<br/>
<br/>
It was really great seeing everyone. I only wish I could have spent<br/>
more time catching up with all of you. I hope we keep in touch and<br/>
find tons more letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Safe Letterboxing!<br/>
