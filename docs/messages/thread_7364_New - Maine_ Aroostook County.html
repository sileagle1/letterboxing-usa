The history of New Sweden began in 1870, after the Civil War,  when William Widgery Thomas, Jr. of Portland, ME was sent to Sweden to recruit immigrants to settle in the great North Woods of Maine.  Twenty-two men, eleven women, and eighteen children arrived that summer to establish a settlement and clear land for their new homesteads.  Having jobs in the logging industry and potato fields meant prosperity and growth for the colony. By 1895, at New Sweden's 25th anniversary, the population had grown to 717, with a total of 1452 Swedes from the area towns as well.  <br/>
<br/>
In New Sweden today, visitors can find the 1974 replica of the Capitolium, the original 1870 public building, which is now the New Sweden Museum.  Behind this museum is the Lindsten Stuga, a restored typical immigrant log cabin. Also nearby is the Capitol School Museum and giftshop.  The town of New Sweden boasts of many historical sites, including the Larsson/Ostlund home, the only two-story log home in Maine from the 1870's era.  A visit to this little town is well worth it, but better go on a Saturday when there's a chance some of these places will be open.  <br/>
