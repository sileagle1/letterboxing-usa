                    <html><body>Today the Cricket Bros went hunting Ma's Artistic Box in Wolf Trail Park in the snow with their friends Little Butterfly and Flame.  The Crickets were also joined by their little sister, the Nymph-cess, on her stamping debut.  <br/>
Big Red Cricket Brother and Flame led the pack and were pushed by those annoying adults to figure out the clues themselves and did very well!  Little Blue Cricket Brother and Little Butterfly had to be peeled out of the snow-covered playground equipment to join them.  Some of the clues were hidden in the snow but we were finally able to find it and everyone liked the stamp and BeMa's musical clues very much.   <br/>
When we got home I helped Red Cricket write a letter looking for a pen pal and was very gratified to hear him say his favorite thing to do was letterboxing, as opposed to Pokemon.  <br/>
Thanks for planting that one, BeMa!  We will be back to that playground again in better weather!  Mother of Crickets</body></html>
