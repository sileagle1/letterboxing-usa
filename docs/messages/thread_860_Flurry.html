And Tom, sorry in advance for all the links! I'm trying again to make <br/>

discussions during your early stages when I felt that I could help out.<br/>
You've moved on a lot since your conception days and I don't think I can<br/>
contribute anything.  I shall just stick with letterboxing on Dartmoor, UK.<br/>
<br/>
Could someone be kind enough to take me off your mailing list.  It was easy<br/>
to start, but I can't work out how to stop.  Good luck in the future.  I am<br/>
in California in August, so I shall check your web sites and see if I can<br/>
get an American stamp to add to my collection.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
