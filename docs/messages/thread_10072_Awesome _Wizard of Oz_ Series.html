series at the Carolina Management Area in Charleston RI . This is <br/>
truly a wonderful series and "Hats off" to all who participated in <br/>
its creation. The stamps are all great and the clues could not have <br/>
been better. The park itself is a great mixture of farm and <br/>
woodlands . It took us about seven hours to complete including the <br/>
Bonus (We got a little confused at some spots). Again "Thank you" to <br/>
all of you for your contribution to this series.<br/>

I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I am not surprised that it took you 7 <br/>
hours.  I am familar with Carolina man. Area and it took me about <br/>
that long too on my Mt bike.  I split it into 2 different trips.  I <br/>
did the first half one day and the second half another day.  <br/>
Definately one of the best series around!<br/>
