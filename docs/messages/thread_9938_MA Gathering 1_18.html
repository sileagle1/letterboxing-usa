<br/>I think it's just wonderful that cscm and RustyPuff are sponsoring an "official" gathering at a nature conservancy. We have had great luck working  with the town of Lyme CT (Hartman Park), the East Lyme Conservation Trust, and with a single Nature Conservancy park manager in promoting letterboxing as a good, low-impact activity in their preserves. Hopefully more of these cooperative efforts can happen nationwide.

<br/>My Mass Audubon coworkers at Moose Hill have all been very amused at this wonderful hobby of mine and pleased at how we've gotten a bunch of our summer camp kids and their families interested in letterboxing as a wholesome family activity. They are, however, REALLY marvelling at how many people are coming to this gathering (and that's just so far...we still have a couple of weeks).
<br/>
<br/>Thanks to everyone else who'll be attending.....we now have over 40 people who have RSVP'd that they are definitely coming or are trying to attend!!  Whew! I can't wait!!

We're in the same boat that Jay is in. If I can get the time off <br/>
work to come, we'll be there. I couldn't make it to the Mystery <br/>
Gathering, or Kids Day, so I hope this one will work out for us and <br/>
this will be our first gathering. If we make it, you'll have four <br/>
more people. Hope to see you there!<br/>
