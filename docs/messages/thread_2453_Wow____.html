One of my friends who read my clues for the Los Osos Oaks series <br/>
commented recently that he hates all the "legalise" in it, which I <br/>
thought was kind of amusing because I didn't think it was <br/>
particularly bad.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the warnings I put in it weren't to protect my butt, though, <br/>
they were to help insure whoever goes looking for the letterbox <br/>
actually has a good time.  That's the whole point, isn't it?  I like <br/>
to describe the trail--particularly how long or steep the trail is so <br/>
people know what they're getting into.  <br/>
<br/>
On the Los Osos Oaks clues, I made a special note of the incredible <br/>
amounts of poison oak growing in the area.  It wasn't to help protect <br/>
me from getting sued, though.  I just wanted to make sure everyone <br/>
who went knew what they were getting into.  Some people are <br/>
hypersensitive to poison oak and probably wouldn't want to come <br/>
within a hundred feet of the stuff.  Others (like myself) who never <br/>
seem to get it even when we know we've touched the stuff don't really <br/>
care.  (Most probably fall somewhere in between, though.)  I want to <br/>
make sure people enjoy the hike, and the best way to help ensure they <br/>
do is to let them know what to expect before they even get there.<br/>
<br/>
I've started adding an extra warning about prodding with a stick or <br/>
using gloves before reaching into big, dark holes.  Not so much to <br/>
protect myself from being sued, but in the hopes whoever reads the <br/>
clues thinks, "Oh, that's a good idea!  Let me get the gloves before <br/>
I leave!"  Then, when they get there, they don't have to worry about <br/>
reaching a bare hand into the large, dark hole.  And perhaps make the <br/>
letterboxing experience that much better.  (Strangely, I forgot to <br/>
bring gloves for the last letterbox I found and resorted to swatting <br/>
around a stick in the hole before reaching in--but it still felt <br/>
wrong to reach in with bare hands.)  The warning wasn't to cover my <br/>
butt as much as it was to help make the letterboxing experience as <br/>
good as possible for the people who are searching for it.<br/>
<br/>
The one and only thing I did to help "protect" myself is provide a <br/>
link to the waiver of responsibility and disclaimer on the LBNA <br/>
website.  I figured, (1) why not?, (2) it couldn't hurt, (3) it does <br/>
provide sound advice (know what you're doing!), and (4) the small <br/>
link isn't very intrusive on the page with the clues.  I don't really <br/>
expect it would stop anyone from suing me, but like I said before, it <br/>
doesn't hurt either.  *shrug*<br/>
