<br/>
Those green flags don't mean that you have "found" them !!<br/>
<br/>
Those green flags mean that the particular box has a hyperlink to the <br/>
clues, so instead of opening up the clues to mark your find, you <br/>
click on the flag to mark your find!<br/>
<br/>
The only place (to the best of my knowledge) where you will see <br/>
your "finds" is when you log into Member Services, which will tell <br/>
you how many you have placed, and, when you actually go in an record <br/>
a find, will tell you what you have found.<br/>
<br/>
The green flags simply signify - "these clues are not hosted on LbNA -<br/>
 they are a hyperlink to the planter's site - if you want to record <br/>
this as a find in LbNA, click on the flag!"<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps.<br/>

&gt; Rosie<br/>
<br/>
If a letterbox is listed with NO FLAG, then simply open the letterbox <br/>
for the clues and you have the option on the clue sheet itself to <br/>
record your find (or attempt).<br/>
<br/>
If a letterbox is listed WITH a flag, when you click ON THE FLAG, it <br/>
takes you to a LbNA-specific-only screen *independent* of the <br/>
placer's site where you can record your find (or attempt).<br/>
<br/>
The flag overrides the hyperlink to the placer's site for the <br/>
purposes of recording finds on LbNA.<br/>
<br/>
Does this make sense?<br/>
<br/>
Just try out a few to get the look and feel, then you'll see what I <br/>
mean.<br/>
