It's a 3 box jigsaw puzzle stamp series. Meaning you must find all three boxes and stamps to complete the whole image. Our question is, does a separate log go in each box, or just one log in the final box? Each stamp makes no sense by itself, you really have to have all three.

I would put a log in each box.  The logs are for the planter.  It's <br/>
possible the last box could go missing, or that some folks may not <br/>
find all threee.  In that case, you might miss seeing some neat sig <br/>
stamps of people who only made it to the first or the first 2.  <br/>
Also, the visitors enjoy seeing the sig stamps at each box.<br/>

Thanks for the response. We are in Bensalem, PA and the image is a "Pot of Gold". The bottom of the pot, middle of the pot, and the gold coins are 3 separate stamps (my son Carmen's idea). We will probably be planting in the next couple weeks and will post clues. I think we'll probably put a log in each box. Thanks again. <br/>

We set up a similar stamp series "Stamp Golf" in Long Beach, Ca. We <br/>
had 8 individual pieces of the stamp set up in individual locations, <br/>
but all on the same course. We put scroll logs in each micro box <br/>
since we figured that there may be some folks that do not complete <br/>
the series. We counted the entire series as one plant and in so doing <br/>
a partial completion should only be counted in fractions,particularly <br/>
for those that keep an accounting. You might want to check out the <br/>
clues/instructions and rules of stamp golf as I stuck my tongue in my <br/>
cheek and they relate to other areas in letterboxing such as the chat <br/>
list communications.<br/>

These kinds of series seem to be quite popular. Recently I found the <br/>
Terra Cotta Tangrams in NJ. Same kind of thing, 7 finds = one image. <br/>
There was only one log in the final box. The other boxes were very <br/>
tiny. <br/>
I will have to agree that placing a log in each box is good, <br/>
especially when one goes missing or seekers are not successful in <br/>
finding all 3.<br/>
I am excited about all the new boxers that are jumping in and carving <br/>
and planting right away. I was much more tentative about planting <br/>
until I had found a good number of boxes. WELCOME TO A VERY ADDICTIVE <br/>

Thanks for the suggestion! I will definately pass this along to my team. This is really interesting because my son Carmen, (who is the creative person on the team, he is the "idea and carving man" Deb and I just hike the hounds!) suggested a series based on one of his other hobbies, disc golf. We have a very wooded disc golf course in a local state park and he thought doing some boxes that tie in with the course, but not too close to be observed by the golfers, would be cool. He'll be thrilled with your input, thanks!<br/>

If the boxes are some distance apart, and are re-hidden before <br/>
moving on to the next one, the individual logbooks would work well.<br/>
If the stamps need to be gathered from boxes in a relatively small <br/>
area, assembled, then all stamped at once (like the Tangram) then <br/>
one book would do.<br/>
