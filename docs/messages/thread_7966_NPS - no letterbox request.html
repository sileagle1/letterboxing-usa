Please advise your members that letterboxing is illegal in National<br/>
Parks.<br/>
The clues often lead searchers off trail, into dangerous areas, and<br/>
has<br/>
lead to disturbance of natural or cultural features.  I am sure that<br/>
the<br/>
activity is interesting and enjoyable for the participants but leaving<br/>
<br/>
containers in odd locations within national parks can cause alarm in<br/>
these<br/>
days and times. All boxes located will be seized by rangers.  The NPS<br/>
is in<br/>
the process of writing specific regulations against geo-caching, a<br/>
similar<br/>
activity, this specific activity will also be addressed.<br/>

National Parks.  A very loud and visible boycott.  Meanwhile, there needs to<br/>
be a representative organization created that can:<br/>

1) Represent the majority of letterboxers, and<br/>

2) Speak for (and lobby on behalf of) the above mentioned group to protect<br/>

Subject:  C &amp; O CANAL - NPS Land<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The C&amp;O Canal is maintained by the National Park Service. Letterboxes<br/>
are not allowed on National Park Service maintained lands.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.nps.gov/choh/<br/>
<br/>
Please remove the letterbox, as it gives the hobby a bad name by<br/>
violating the land manager's policies. And if anyone else places<br/>
letterboxes on NPS land and were unaware of their policy, here you go.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Jeremy <br/>

<br/>
Seems as though we have a tattletale.  For those unaware, Jeremy <br/>
Irish runs the Geocaching world, and meddles in this one.<br/>
