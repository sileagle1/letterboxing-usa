clues:<br/>
<br/>
Picacho Peak Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Azroadie<br/>
Placement date: February 22, 2004<br/>
State:  Arizona<br/>
County:   Pinal<br/>
Nearest town:  Picacho<br/>
Difficulty:   Clues easy; walk moderate<br/>
Walking time: about 15 minutes one way<br/>
<br/>
The box is in Picacho Peak State Park.  There is a fee to enter the <br/>
park.  Take I-10 to exit 219 and follow brown signs to the park <br/>
entrance.  Drive on the main park road all the way to the end and <br/>
park there.<br/>
<br/>
Take the "Sunset Vista Trail" which goes moderately steeply up the <br/>
slope of the mountain.  As you wind up the steep slope you will pass <br/>
a tall rock cliff on your right. Soon, after walking up three wood <br/>
steps you will pass two small  Saguaro cactus without arms on the <br/>
left edge of the trail.  A short distance more you will arrive at a <br/>
small saddle with a flat area a little wider than the trail.  At the <br/>
saddle go right (southwest) off trail on a faint "unofficial" trail <br/>
up to the top of the ridge.  From the ridge crest go down at about <br/>
254 degrees (from north) to a loan Saguaro cactus in a small <br/>
saddle.  From the loan Saguaro go up at about 250 degrees (from <br/>
north) for about 23 paces to a small dead Palo Verde tree on the <br/>
crest of a rock ridge.  The box is under the northwest side of the <br/>
dead tree under some rocks and twigs.   From the top of this rock <br/>
ridge enjoy the view of the Santa Cruz Valley.<br/>
<br/>
I will not be able to check on this box very often; so, please let <br/>
me know if you find it.  Also, let me know if it is missing so that <br/>
I can delete the clues:<br/>
