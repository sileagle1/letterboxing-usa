<br/>
After a couple of months of letterboxing I have several observations.<br/>
<br/>
1. I think the main reason letterboxes go missing is poor replacement by<br/>
visitors. [This assumes a good hiding spot by the placer! :-)] I base this<br/>
on observing the several letterboxes I've planted. They are within walking<br/>
distance of my house; so I check on them a couple of times a week when out<br/>
walking the dog. Many times the boxes are not re-hidden as well as when the<br/>
folks discovered them. And these are seasoned letterboxers I'm talking<br/>
about. Perhaps the area was busy; so they had to do the mad stash to return<br/>
the box. At any rate, I can see how letterboxes that can't be checked very<br/>
often are the ones most likely to go missing.<br/>
<br/>
2. When putting the stamps and journals back in the letterbox, these same<br/>
folks sometimes don't get the journal back into its zippy. This seems to<br/>
happen when a group of letterboxers stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
3.After I've visited a letterbox, I email the owner to let them know how<br/>
their box is doing. I've only had a couple of folks let me know how my<br/>
letterboxes are doing. Much appreciated. Isn't this a common courtesy?<br/>
<br/>
4. I make a little certificate for the first finder congratulating them. It<br/>
also asks them to email me and let me know what they think of my letterbox.<br/>
I've yet to hear from any firsties. I know it's a bit vane on my part, but<br/>
I am curious to know what others think of my letterboxes. Do most of you<br/>
ever hear from firsties?<br/>
<br/>
5. I've found a couple of hitchhikers in my journeys. I've contacted the<br/>
creators about their HH letting them know the details of its journey. But<br/>
surprisingly, I've not heard a word back from them. I know a lot of folks<br/>
who've launched HHs are quite curious to hear about their travels. It<br/>
baffles me as to why someone who creates a HH won't take the time to let a<br/>
person know they received the info on their HH. Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, I'm a newbie with lots of enthusiasm. Maybe I've just got to learn<br/>
to be more callus in my outlook. Perhaps this is only a Pacific Northwest<br/>
thing. Is it different in the hotbed of letterboxing in the Northeast and<br/>
other areas of the country?<br/>
<br/>
OK, my mild rant is over. Nothing too serious, eh?<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, you can't count on someone finding your box replacing the box <br/>
as well as or better than it was found.  A *good* hiding place tries <br/>
to idiot-proof the process, though.  Some places are hard to get <br/>
JUST right.  There's one tree in particular I remember where I hid a <br/>
box, and someone I had test looking for the box couldn't see it even <br/>
when they looked in the right hole and it was inches from their <br/>
face.  Later visits showed the box virtually in plain view with over <br/>
a dozen people who'd found it by accident.  In the end, I had to <br/>
conclude it was a bad hiding spot because the box needed to be place <br/>
JUST right so it wasn't in view, and the people replacing it didn't <br/>
realize (or care?) about it.  *shrug*<br/>
<br/>
But a good hiding place should make it easy for even the most <br/>
careless letterboxers to hide the box well.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; When putting the stamps and journals back in the letterbox,<br/>
&gt; these same folks sometimes don't get the journal back into its<br/>
&gt; zippy.<br/>
<br/>
In an ideal world, that would never happen.  But we haven't reached <br/>
that point yet.  Make sure you've got a good letterbox container in <br/>
the first place, though, because even properly bagged journals fail!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; After I've visited a letterbox, I email the owner to let them know<br/>
&gt; how their box is doing.... Isn't this a common courtesy?<br/>
<br/>
It's nice when that happens, but that's NOT normal for most <br/>
letterboxers.  I'm even guilty of not reporting finds--mostly out of <br/>
laziness.  Usually I'll write if there's a problem with the box, but <br/>
otherwise it's a shoot or miss thing for me.  (Depends on how <br/>
reliable my Internet access is as well.  There are times when I <br/>
*can't* e-mail people easily.)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do most of you ever hear from firsties?<br/>
<br/>
Nope.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to hiding letterboxes, you really need a mindset that <br/>
you're doing it for others to enjoy and let it go at that.  If you <br/>
get too emotionally attached to a letterbox you've placed--it's <br/>
bound to hurt you eventually.  Either it doesn't get the visitors <br/>
you hoped for, or the box goes missing, or whatever.  Just remember, <br/>
though, even if you don't hear back about your boxes as much as <br/>
you'd like, there's still people out there who enjoy finding them <br/>
and appreciate your efforts.<br/>
<br/>
There are boxes I've hidden nearly three years ago and haven't heard <br/>
so much as a whisper about.  Of course, they do tend to be a little <br/>
off the beaten path, but still, three years is quite a while to go <br/>
for nobody to find a box!<br/>

You have hit a very sore spot with me. I have gone after certain very well seasoned letterboxers and found that same thing, the badly rehid boxes with the bags not sealed, etc.  They should know better because they have boxes of their own and wouldn't want anyone to treat their's in that manner. On one encounter this group came upon a disabled person who had located the first box of a series to find that the disabled person was a first finder. The group stamped in with the disabled person past them by and left every box of the rest of the series out and they went on their happy way to the very big dismay of the disabled person. It's one thing to want a high count but it's entirely another to have total disregard for your fellow letterboxers whether they are finding or planter. <br/>
Sorry this has been a very sore spot for a while. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest. <br/>

(with the obvious exception of virtual letterboxes). Emails from <br/>
finders are delightful, but not expected. I only send them when a <br/>
box needs attention by the placer. I assume that part of my <br/>
responsibility in placing a box is returning to it regularly to <br/>
maintain and THEN read notes from finders, in the log, in the great <br/>
outdoors. (At which point I do the happy dance, "They liked it! They <br/>
liked it!" much to the embarrassment of my family.)<br/>

&gt; surprisingly, I've not heard a word back from them. I know a lot of <br/>
folks<br/>
&gt; who've launched HHs are quite curious to hear about their travels. <br/>
It<br/>
&gt; baffles me as to why someone who creates a HH won't take the time <br/>
to let a<br/>
&gt; person know they received the info on their HH. Oh well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So yes, I'm a newbie with lots of enthusiasm. Maybe I've just got <br/>
to learn<br/>
&gt; to be more callus in my outlook. Perhaps this is only a Pacific <br/>
Northwest<br/>
&gt; thing. Is it different in the hotbed of letterboxing in the <br/>
Northeast and<br/>
&gt; other areas of the country?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OK, my mild rant is over. Nothing too serious, eh?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to agree with Ryan here... some spots are really hard to get boxes<br/>
back in "safely". We hit one of those on our group trip two weeks ago. It<br/>
was tucked under a nurse log in a hole, but man, I could NOT get that box<br/>
back in it's little hole the way it came out. Someone else mananged to get<br/>
it back in better than I did, but it was very difficult.<br/>
<br/>
And to address the original post, some letterboxes go missing because of<br/>
poor placement in the first place, or just plain bad luck. I've lost 3 boxes<br/>
so far, out of 50. The first one I lost was under a bridge where there were<br/>
homeless people living. Poof gone. Second one I lost was under a log, a VERY<br/>
mossy log, on a secondary trail, tucked INSIDE the pile of logs. It was by<br/>
far my most perfect hiding spot. Easy to get to, almost handicap accessible,<br/>
safely out of sight, etc etc. Except for the fact that 3 months later the<br/>
park people decided my log needed to be removed. They cut it up and took it<br/>
away.. no word from my box.<br/>
<br/>
The third one was also behind a log on a college campus. It also got<br/>
"cleaned up". This time the grounds people saved it for me and even helped<br/>
me to relocate it.<br/>
<br/>
As for #2.. I have a hard time when people don't put things back in bags. I<br/>
always carry extra bags, from teeny tiny ones for stamps all the way up to<br/>
gallon size in case the box is cracked.<br/>
<br/>
I try to email box placers for all boxes I find, for the same reason..I love<br/>
to hear how my boxes are doing, so I know others probably do as well.<br/>
<br/>
Just keep emailing people, sooner or later it might catch on.<br/>

<br/>
  &gt; 1. I think the main reason letterboxes go missing is poor<br/>
  &gt; replacement by visitors. [This assumes a good hiding spot by the<br/>
  &gt; placer! :-)]<br/>
<br/>
  Yeah, you can't count on someone finding your box replacing the box<br/>
  as well as or better than it was found.  A *good* hiding place tries<br/>
  to idiot-proof the process, though.  Some places are hard to get<br/>
  JUST right.  There's one tree in particular I remember where I hid a<br/>
  box, and someone I had test looking for the box couldn't see it even<br/>
  when they looked in the right hole and it was inches from their<br/>
  face.  Later visits showed the box virtually in plain view with over<br/>
  a dozen people who'd found it by accident.  In the end, I had to<br/>
  conclude it was a bad hiding spot because the box needed to be place<br/>
  JUST right so it wasn't in view, and the people replacing it didn't<br/>
  realize (or care?) about it.  *shrug*<br/>
<br/>
  But a good hiding place should make it easy for even the most<br/>
  careless letterboxers to hide the box well.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; When putting the stamps and journals back in the letterbox,<br/>
  &gt; these same folks sometimes don't get the journal back into its<br/>
  &gt; zippy.<br/>
<br/>
  In an ideal world, that would never happen.  But we haven't reached<br/>
  that point yet.  Make sure you've got a good letterbox container in<br/>
  the first place, though, because even properly bagged journals fail!<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; After I've visited a letterbox, I email the owner to let them know<br/>
  &gt; how their box is doing.... Isn't this a common courtesy?<br/>
<br/>
  It's nice when that happens, but that's NOT normal for most<br/>
  letterboxers.  I'm even guilty of not reporting finds--mostly out of<br/>
  laziness.  Usually I'll write if there's a problem with the box, but<br/>
  otherwise it's a shoot or miss thing for me.  (Depends on how<br/>
  reliable my Internet access is as well.  There are times when I<br/>
  *can't* e-mail people easily.)<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Do most of you ever hear from firsties?<br/>
<br/>
  Nope.<br/>
<br/>
  When it comes to hiding letterboxes, you really need a mindset that<br/>
  you're doing it for others to enjoy and let it go at that.  If you<br/>
  get too emotionally attached to a letterbox you've placed--it's<br/>
  bound to hurt you eventually.  Either it doesn't get the visitors<br/>
  you hoped for, or the box goes missing, or whatever.  Just remember,<br/>
  though, even if you don't hear back about your boxes as much as<br/>
  you'd like, there's still people out there who enjoy finding them<br/>
  and appreciate your efforts.<br/>
<br/>
  There are boxes I've hidden nearly three years ago and haven't heard<br/>
  so much as a whisper about.  Of course, they do tend to be a little<br/>
  off the beaten path, but still, three years is quite a while to go<br/>
  for nobody to find a box!<br/>

. Many times the boxes are not re-hidden as<br/>
&gt; well as when the<br/>
&gt; folks discovered them. And these are seasoned letterboxers I'm talking<br/>
&gt; about.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how "seasoned" I am, but I can say that I personally would<br/>
appreciate it if someone told me when I didn't rehide a box well.  Often am<br/>
boxing with my children and allow them to find or replace the box.  SO, I<br/>
don't always know how it was originally hid, or how it was replaced.  I try<br/>
to check, but....<br/>
<br/>
So, perhaps dropping a *friendly* note after finding a less-than-well<br/>
replaced box would go a  ways towards alleviating the problem?<br/>
<br/>
I know reading the friendlier posts on this subject has reminded me to be<br/>
more considerate.<br/>

That sounds like a perfect example of people needing to step back, get a perspective, cut down on the caffeine, and re-focus on what letterboxing is all about.  I sure hope no kids were along with that group, to see their bad example.  If the getting the counts makes one that obsessed, it may be time to move to a new state where getting the counts can't possibly be the main attraction of letterboxing.  To be honest, once I learned that CT is practically crawling w/ boxes, while I need to count on a minimum of 2-3 hours spent on just about every search in my vicinity, I just stopped even looking at all those counts so I wouldn't get discouraged.  I'm just happy to have a few nifty stamps in my book, and discover some cool hikes.  I was careful about re-packing the other day even when gnats were swarming me due to our proximity to a vulture's lovely dead dinner. (Story remains to be told when I have time). I forgot to bring baggies, but won't forget again.  I hope my boxes get treated better here in PA, when I plant some.   -lunaryakketyact<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">All very good observations on your part.  Let me share something <br/>
with you.... After planting our Snow Dogs series in Breeseman <br/>
Forest near our home (And I mean within a 5 minute drive) and <br/>
reading of the horror stories on the list, I decided to keep an <br/>
eye on them and check them.  Every day ( I was unemployed at <br/>
the time, had time to burn, and they were, after all, our first <br/>
plants and were kinda special to us.) I would go and check on <br/>
them.... They sat lonely for a little while and then a few people <br/>
came searching for them.  Most everyone put them back in the same <br/>
place and the same way that I had originally hidden them, <br/>
however......<br/>
<br/>
It became apparently obvious that there were/are two types of <br/>
letterboxers in my not so humble opinion.  The first group appear <br/>
to have been doing this for quite some time and are very careful <br/>
and quiet about how they do things and how they replace things.  <br/>
The other group on the other hand..... Well, lets just say, if <br/>
you remember Goofus and Gallant, suffice it to say that the second <br/>
group is NOT related to Gallant in any manner at all. (grin)  Now, <br/>
before this goes any farther, let me say that I am not pointing <br/>
fingers at anyone nor am I accusing anyone of belonging to either <br/>
group.  I'm just sharing my observations.<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest problem that we as a group face together in <br/>
this sport/hobby is the lack of organization.  Mark Pepe makes a <br/>
good point about it over on his website on this same subject.  <br/>
Now, first off, let me say this. Even having an organization will <br/>
not stop people from improperly re hiding a letterbox after they <br/>
are done stamping it in. That's a manners/etiquette/respect thing <br/>
an if you didn't learn it in your childhood, it'll be hard to <br/>
learn it now.<br/>
<br/>
I can't tell you the number of times I had to re-hide my boxes in <br/>
Breeseman Forest. Now, I can not tell you if the last person to <br/>
stamp in was the one responsible for not re-hiding the box <br/>
correctly, but that's what I believe it was.  Based on the fact <br/>
that whenever I discovered evidence of teenagers or others in the <br/>
area of one of the boxes and it was missing, all I can assume is <br/>
that either the 'others' stumbled across it, which could very well <br/>
happen, or, the last person to stamp in didn't re-hide it well <br/>
enough and it was discovered.  Overall we lost several of the boxes <br/>
and have since pulled the boxes, carving a new series to replace <br/>
the Snow Dogs in that park.<br/>
<br/>
So, to make a short story long, I'll just say this.... Am much <br/>
fun as the 'No Rules' seem to be for some, I believe that we <br/>
need rules and guidelines to help guide the new people entering <br/>
this hobby in the correct direction.<br/>
<br/>
That's just my 2.786756434342356 cents worth.  (grin)<br/>

<br/>
Just because one person or even a few people can't or will not, or don't yet know how to 'respect' my boxes, doesn't <br/>
mean that I'm going to stop planting boxes.  I look at it this way.  When I place it in the wild, it's gone. If I hear <br/>
anything back, that's bonus. If I check on it and it disappears, I recreate it and replace it. I keep all the artwork <br/>
I used to make the box so that's no problem.  It's only a few dollars and if I can't afford that, then I'd better find <br/>
a different hobby to do.  So, I for one, am not going to stop placing boxes if others don't start respecting them.<br/>
<br/>

to disagree. We need not rules for letterboxing, but respect. <br/>
Ultimately the reason why we're very careful in replacing boxes is <br/>
that we respect the time, money, effort, thought and little piece of <br/>
yourself that each letterboxer includes on every single box they <br/>
plant. We don't care if your carvings are not quite "smithsonian <br/>
material", we don't care if we hike 1 mile for 20 boxes or 11 miles <br/>
for 4 (which we've done!).   What we care about is that when we find <br/>
a box, we leave it in as good (or better) condition then we found it <br/>
so that the next group of hunters can enjoy the catch!<br/>
<br/>
So now that we said that, its tough to instill the same traits on <br/>
1600 + people that are members of this list plus everyone else who <br/>
does not belong to the message board. <br/>
<br/>
Is there a solution? Probably not. If there was a solution, some of <br/>
our friends with 100,200,300 + placed boxes might not be missing 50 <br/>
or 60 of them. Just remember... pretend that every box you find is <br/>
one you've planted and treat it with the same care!<br/>

Thanks for all of your kind observations of my original post. I have a much<br/>
better idea of what y'all expect of your planted letterboxes. I like Ryan's<br/>
mindset of planting boxes for others to enjoy. And that is the reason I do<br/>
it. It's a lot of fun. There are many more places nearby that cry out for<br/>
letterboxes!<br/>

So if any of you make to Seattle, be sure to look check out the local<br/>

&gt; Hello fellow letterboxers,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for all of your kind observations of my original post. I have a<br/>
much<br/>
&gt; better idea of what y'all expect of your planted letterboxes. I like<br/>
Ryan's<br/>
&gt; mindset of planting boxes for others to enjoy. And that is the reason I do<br/>
&gt; it. It's a lot of fun. There are many more places nearby that cry out for<br/>
&gt; letterboxes!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So if any of you make to Seattle, be sure to look check out the local<br/>
&gt; selection of letterboxes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have fun planting.<br/>

But, I do have an observation on the observations as pertains to the <br/>

box with kids, although on occasion I have taken my 7-yr. old grand-<br/>

this will probably not win me any popularity points with the family <br/>

this will be.<br/>
<br/>
I understand how exciting it is for a child to be the one to <br/>
retreive the box from its hiding spot -- heck, it's still a rush for <br/>
me.  But just because the kids are taking the box out and putting it <br/>
back in, doesn't relieve you of responsibility for making sure the <br/>
box is rehid as well or better than when you found it.  <br/>
<br/>
The statement about not knowing how the box was originally hidden or <br/>
how it was replaced bothered me.  I am assuming you are actually <br/>
with the child as they fetch the box, so I don't quite understand <br/>
how you wouldn't know how it was originally hidden?  And when <br/>
replacing the box, even if speedy little fingers prevented you from <br/>
seeing precisely how it was wedged into the crevice, it is still <br/>
possible to replace the box and verify it is thoroughly concealed <br/>
and hidden from view from all angles.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I am misunderstanding the comment, but I am picturing a <br/>
mother standing 50 ft. away on the trail with the stroller while <br/>
little Timmy runs off into the woods to fetch (and subsequently <br/>
return) the letterbox from the tree stump.  How can any responsible <br/>
letterboxer walk away not knowing if the box was replaced in the <br/>
same spot and adequately concealed?  If location prevents you from <br/>
personally supervising the retrieval and return of the letterbox, <br/>
then perhaps you've chosen the wrong letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
It is not the responsibility of subsequent letterboxers or the box <br/>
owner to let you know if your child did a good job of replacing a <br/>
letterbox.  If the box is not replaced well it becomes vulnerable <br/>
and there may never be an opportunity for someone to come behind and <br/>
provide you with a friendly note.  It is your responsibilty as a <br/>
parent to make sure your child has replaced and rehidden the box <br/>
well, before you walk away from the box. <br/>

 you are right--if I was standing back with the stroller while my son was<br/>
off in he distance, I would be quite irresponsible, as a boxer and more<br/>
importantly, as a parent.  That is not how it works for me.<br/>
<br/>
First, I view  letterboxing as a great opportunity to teach my children many<br/>
things--first and foremost about our world and enjoying and respecting<br/>
nature.  Of course, there are also the more basic lessons such as  counting,<br/>
reading a compass and following directions.  This leads often to my children<br/>
retrieving the box from behind the tree, bush, whatever and I do not see if<br/>
it was under rock A or rock B or how the rocks were stacked.  We do our best<br/>
to rehide it, and I try to double check from a variety of angles that it<br/>
cannot be seen.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad I live in an area that supports family boxing.  I realize many may<br/>
believe children should not be  doing this--and I would respect any one who<br/>
posted "adults only" or whatever in their clues.  I do want to make sure my<br/>
children learn to do this responsibly and respectfully--and that means I<br/>
appreciate hearing if we are doing something wrong (For example, not sealing<br/>
baggies)  It is not any one else's responsibility to tell me, but it is a<br/>
considerate thing to do; just as I strive to teach my children discretion in<br/>
retrieving and replacing (an that is why my children are often rehiding the<br/>
boxes--it is a bit obvious that something is going on when a lady and three<br/>
kids are huddled around a bush)<br/>
<br/>
I do my best to make this a fun activity for everyone--and not ruin it for<br/>
those who come behind.  that is why I appreciate learning if there is<br/>
somethign I cold do differently.   I have gone boxing in groups and my<br/>
family activity is often more discreet and repsectful than large groups can<br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate you input, really, and appreciate you effort to not be too<br/>
unfriendly (grin)<br/>

family boxing, I certainly am not against letterboxing with kids and <br/>
have actually placed a few series here in West Michigan specifically <br/>
with families in mind.  You are correct -- there are a multitude of <br/>
valuable lessons that can be taught to children while on the <br/>
letterboxing trail.  I cannot tell you how thrilled I was when my <br/>
grand-daughter took over navigation on a recent hunt -- reading the <br/>
clues, manning the compass, the whole deal.<br/>
<br/>
But at the same time, there is probably more responsibility placed on <br/>
an adult letterboxer when they are with children -- overseeing not <br/>
only the respect and diligent replacement of the box, but also of the <br/>
environment, etc.  The fact that a child was the one who replaced the <br/>
box is in my opinion not a valid excuse for poor replacement and it <br/>
is not considerate to the box owner or other letterboxers if this <br/>
compromises the box or hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for not taking my comments personally and/or blowing them <br/>
out of proportion.  Even though they were posted in response to your <br/>
comments, they were not specifically directed at you or any other <br/>
letterboxing parent.  It is applicable to all.<br/>

&gt; posted "adults only" or whatever in their clues.  I do want to make <br/>
sure my<br/>
&gt; children learn to do this responsibly and respectfully--and that <br/>
means I<br/>
&gt; appreciate hearing if we are doing something wrong (For example, <br/>
not sealing<br/>
&gt; baggies)  It is not any one else's responsibility to tell me, but <br/>
it is a<br/>
&gt; considerate thing to do; just as I strive to teach my children <br/>
discretion in<br/>
&gt; retrieving and replacing (an that is why my children are often <br/>
rehiding the<br/>
&gt; boxes--it is a bit obvious that something is going on when a lady <br/>
and three<br/>
&gt; kids are huddled around a bush)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do my best to make this a fun activity for everyone--and not ruin <br/>
it for<br/>
&gt; those who come behind.  that is why I appreciate learning if there <br/>
is<br/>
&gt; somethign I cold do differently.   I have gone boxing in groups and <br/>
my<br/>
&gt; family activity is often more discreet and repsectful than large <br/>
groups can<br/>
&gt; be.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I appreciate you input, really, and appreciate you effort to not be <br/>
too<br/>
&gt; unfriendly (grin)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I understand how exciting it is for a child to be the one to<br/>
&gt; &gt; retreive the box from its hiding spot -- heck, it's still a rush <br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; me.  But just because the kids are taking the box out and putting <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; back in, doesn't relieve you of responsibility for making sure the<br/>
&gt; &gt; box is rehid as well or better than when you found it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The statement about not knowing how the box was originally hidden <br/>
or<br/>
&gt; &gt; how it was replaced bothered me.  I am assuming you are actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the child as they fetch the box, so I don't quite understand<br/>
&gt; &gt; how you wouldn't know how it was originally hidden?  And when<br/>
&gt; &gt; replacing the box, even if speedy little fingers prevented you <br/>
from<br/>
&gt; &gt; seeing precisely how it was wedged into the crevice, it is still<br/>
&gt; &gt; possible to replace the box and verify it is thoroughly concealed<br/>
&gt; &gt; and hidden from view from all angles.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Perhaps I am misunderstanding the comment, but I am picturing a<br/>
&gt; &gt; mother standing 50 ft. away on the trail with the stroller while<br/>
&gt; &gt; little Timmy runs off into the woods to fetch (and subsequently<br/>
&gt; &gt; return) the letterbox from the tree stump.  How can any <br/>
responsible<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxer walk away not knowing if the box was replaced in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same spot and adequately concealed?  If location prevents you from<br/>
&gt; &gt; personally supervising the retrieval and return of the letterbox,<br/>
&gt; &gt; then perhaps you've chosen the wrong letterbox.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It is not the responsibility of subsequent letterboxers or the box<br/>
&gt; &gt; owner to let you know if your child did a good job of replacing a<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox.  If the box is not replaced well it becomes vulnerable<br/>
&gt; &gt; and there may never be an opportunity for someone to come behind <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; provide you with a friendly note.  It is your responsibilty as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; parent to make sure your child has replaced and rehidden the box<br/>
&gt; &gt; well, before you walk away from the box.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; . Many times the boxes are not re-hidden as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well as when the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; folks discovered them. And these are seasoned letterboxers I'm<br/>
&gt; &gt; talking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know how "seasoned" I am, but I can say that I <br/>
personally<br/>
&gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; appreciate it if someone told me when I didn't rehide a box <br/>
well.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Often am<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxing with my children and allow them to find or replace the<br/>
&gt; &gt; box.  SO, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't always know how it was originally hid, or how it was<br/>
&gt; &gt; replaced.  I try<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to check, but....<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, perhaps dropping a *friendly* note after finding a less-<br/>
than-<br/>
&gt; &gt; well<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; replaced box would go a  ways towards alleviating the problem?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I know reading the friendlier posts on this subject has reminded<br/>
&gt; &gt; me to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more considerate.<br/>

<br/>
I think this is absolutely appropriate and, of course, is great fun for the <br/>
kids, but I also agree that it does not exempt the accompanying grown-up from <br/>
making sure all is safe and well - the letterbox and the child included.<br/>
<br/>
How many times would CSCM, a 38yr old MAN!, plop himself right down in poison <br/>
ivy if I wasn't watching!! The same goes for young children. A grown up <br/>
should be right there making sure the box is replaced properly, the child is not in <br/>
harm's way (poison ivy/oak, putting hands in holes where snakes might be, <br/>
near broken glass etc).<br/>
<br/>
It all falls under the same worldly umbrella...The Golden Rule. "Consider and <br/>
treat others the way you would like to be considered/treated". It doesn't get <br/>
any simpler than that.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>

<br/>
One other point I'd like to make about this post is that no one should let <br/>
their child retrieve a box unsupervised - is there a possibility the location is <br/>
dangerous?  Do you know whether you have rattlesnakes, copperheads or <br/>
cottonmouths in your area?  How about poisonous spiders or rodents that might bite <br/>
your child's reaching hand if the box is located incoveniently close to their <br/>
burrow or nest?  I sometimes let my 7 year old take out the boxes while I watch <br/>
and we always disturb the spot first with a stick and never reach into a hole <br/>
we can't fully see into.  I know I'd be an unhappy mom if a cranky squirrel <br/>
bit my kid, much less a rabid racoon, poisonous snake or insect, piece of glass, <br/>
rusty can, etc.<br/>
