Rest and Relaxation<br/>
The Golden Exacto Award <br/>
All in good standing!!  The Golden Exacto was a great stopping point. For our visit there should have been a Golden Mosquito stamp!!  We had that just given blood feeling when we returned to the car!!!<br/>

Brown Beaver Letterbox<br/>
The Finished<br/>
The "Brown Beaver", I can see how this box would go missing a lot! But it is a great park and would hope the beaver finds a new home there.  And althought the clue page said "The Finished" was missing we were right there so had to check... still missing!<br/>
<br/>
Picked up "The Hourglass Hitchhicker" and left the "Turtle Island Preserve Hitchhiker". Every time we box here we have found a hitchhiker, it is the "Vacation Land" you would think they would want to stay and take in the sites...<br/>
or... are they just dieing to get out of there before the winter comes ??  <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to a cool dry fall so we can get out and box more,<br/>
cbjinnj  or "The Great Outdoors" and "Frogga" <br/>
