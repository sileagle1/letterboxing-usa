<br/>
     Found Grandma's Closet Monday 1 and 5 on 03-Oct-2003.<br/>
     Both were easy finds.<br/>
<br/>
      Found Grandma's Closet Monday 4 on 09-May-2004 after a<br/>
      hard search.  Could not locate 2 or 3!<br/>
<br/>
     Found Grandma's Closet Tuesday 1-5 on 03-Oct-2003 - all easy.<br/>
<br/>
     Found Grandma's Closet Wednesday Morning 1,2,4 on 09-May-2004<br/>
     3 appears to be missing.<br/>
<br/>
     Found Grandma's Closet Wednesday Afternoon 1,2,4 on 09-May-2004.<br/>
    3 is missing.    Both these sites are across the ROAD from Tuesday (not<br/>
    across the bridge per se).  Wed. morning was easy.  Wed Afternoon was<br/>
    an exhausting climb.<br/>

&gt; Has anyone found these since the floods this Spring?  Saturday I took<br/>
&gt; my 2 grandsons and their Mom out looking for "Grandma's Closet<br/>
&gt; Monday" and we didn't find any of them...I know I went on the wrong<br/>
&gt; day and they are invisible every day except the one they are designed<br/>
&gt; for right? *SMILE*  #1 is noted as missing on the clues.  I have<br/>
&gt; never seen a micro-box so wasn't really sure what we were looking<br/>

&gt; I heard lots of folks use for micro-boxes.  There was lots of washed<br/>
