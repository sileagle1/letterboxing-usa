I did a few boxes in Coventry today.  I picked up Mousing in Laidlaw, Red School house, Cyndi, and Glass factory.   The box at the school house was sitting on the stone wall so I hid in the wall under a door.   The clues I had said under the outhouse but that fell down in a storm.  (The clues were old though and may have been updated).  All the others wre in fine shape but some had not had any visitors in a while.   we also ran into The upside down gang for an exchange near the Gaelic Mystery box.  A good day of boxing!!!<br/>
