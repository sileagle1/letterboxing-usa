<div>1.5 hour easy, flat, "out and back" hike, a few scrambles to 
cross seasonal brooks. The water company owning this public water supply granted 
permission for a letterbox and requests hikers to stay on the established 
trail.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The "Great Trail of New England" passed near this old Trolley 
bed trail. This was the main footpath in New England for Native Americans for 
thousands of years.  Native Americans would spend time on the Connecticut 
river fishing for shad and salmon, then walk to Boston  to enjoy Cod and 
shellfish. They would stop at Shenipsit Lake during their journeys as they were 
aware of the abundance of fish. The boundaries of the three great tribes of 
Nipmucks, Podunks, and Mohegans met at this lake.  In 1631 Podunk Prince 
Waginnacut lead a party from his tribe in South Windsor, CT  to visit 
Governor Winthrop of the Massachusetts bay colony. The Podunk prince wanted to 
encourage white settlers to come down to Connecticut.  The Governor objected but the migration did indeed begin.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Directions:</div>
<div>Interstate 84 to exit 67. Turn North onto route 31. At traffic 
light turn right onto route 30 North.  Go .9 miles and turn left just after 
the carwash onto Sandhill Road.  Turn right at the end.  Take first 
left onto Shenipsit Lake Road. Go 1.7 miles, drive across small bridge at 
lake.  Take first left onto Ellington Road. Park along the side of 
this dirt road.  Walk back in the direction which you drove in from. Cross 
back over bridge, walk past the log cabin type home, and see trail head on the 
right side just past this house. Stay to the right of the split rail 
fence.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Twice you will need to scramble down to cross a seasonal 
brook.  Enjoy the glimpses of cornfields on your left. Pass by a split rail 
fence on your right.</div>
<div>Cross over the Lincoln-log style dirt covered foot 
bridge.  Eventually you will come to a more substantial foot bridge with 
upright posts and rails, and a wood plank floor. Cross this bridge and walk 12 
paces. On the left side stands a tree with two trunks. Seek where the trunks 
meet.</div></body></html>
