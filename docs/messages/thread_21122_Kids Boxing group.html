I am super cautious about this topic.  I began to wonder, if it is the social aspect that you <br/>
wish to bring to children and letterboxing, couldn't parents make an attempt to take their <br/>
children to events where other families with children are present?  In person contact first, <br/>
and then consider social contact via snailmail, telephone and monitored email.  Do the <br/>
children really need email or live chat to socialize?<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

In reading all the posts and thinking about everything this would <br/>
involve, I've come to the conclusion that I would hesitate to allow <br/>
my daughter to be involved in a kids' online group. I allowed her to <br/>
sign up on Atlas Quest and went over all the answers she would be <br/>
putting in her profile. Despite this type of explanation and <br/>
monitoring, she managed to post our full mailing address. <br/>
Thankfully, speedsquare caught it and notified me right away <br/>
(Thanks!) and I was able to modify it almost immediately. I think I <br/>
prefer that she stick with our plan to introduce letterboxing to her <br/>
girl scout troop, and perhaps meeting other boxers her own age at <br/>
future Gatherings.<br/>
