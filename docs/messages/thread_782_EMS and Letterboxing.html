<div>    My name is Sarah and I am the manager of 
the EMS store in Waterford, CT.  I have been following LbNA for a while 
now, but have been communicating more one on one with Erik and Susan Davis, Tom 
Cooch, and Jay Drew about their boxes and our plans at EMS.  Letterboxing 
has been a wonderful addition to our store since Bob Disch and I introduced it 
immediately following the Smithsonian article.  Getting our Home office to 
support our efforts has been a bit of a battle.  I believe they have 
finally come around, and have had some signage and fixturing build specifically 
for Letterboxing in our store.  </div>
<div>    Currently we have a place for Letterboxers 
to register their stamps in the store and collect clue sheets.  Most of the 
clue sheets have been put on LbNA, but there are some that haven't made it there 
yet.  We run a regular Outdoors Skills Clinic series and the Intro. to Map 
and Compass / Letterboxing ones have been the most popular over the past 
year.  There isn't a single day that goes by that one of my staff members 
isn't asked "What is Letterboxing?".  I have met some wonderful 
people thru Letterboxing, and heard great stories of their quests.  One of 
our regulars even went to Dartmoor this summer and found the Cranmere Pool box, 
he made several impressions of the stamp and said he would bring one by to put 
on display in the store.  We probably have 50 stamps registered in our 
store, but I know of several who haven't stamped in.  Local Schools, 
Science Centers, Scout groups, and Church groups have all become involved in one 
degree or another.  It has become a great "Club" and people are 
always coming in with great enthusiasm.  One customer suggested a pot luck 
picnic, so we could all put faces and names with stamps, etc...  (She also 
wanted to tie Ray of "Ray's Dilemma" to a tree and get some hints out 
of him for the location of his Box.)</div>
<div>    Let me know how we at EMS can help out with 
the next gathering, especially if it's in our back yard.  I know there has 
been some talk about the expense of Mystic or Newport, perhaps a gathering at a 
Campground ?  Anyway, we are always open to feedback and anything we can do 
for our fellow Letterboxers.  </div>
