<div>Dan and I have just returned from a busy Memorial Day 
Weekend in Vermont.  On our way up we stopped at Wendell State Forest to 
stamp in at the three boxes there before they were removed.  Being a 
somewhat soggy Friday, the forest was very quiet.  We had a great hike 
along streams and waterfalls and found all three boxes in good condition.  
</div>
<div>Saturday we got up early and headed for the Braintree 
and Randolf letterboxes.  We first stopped at the Braintree Panther.  
Max growled at the panther as we passed by.  We quickly found the box, but 
were being watched by the neighbors barking dog.  We stamped in and put 
that one back before being stopped by the dog.  Next, we tried for Rolling 
Rock, but after many attempts did not find it.  We decided to give that one 
up and head down to Mud Pond.  This place was so peaceful.  Only the 
singing birds could be heard.  We enjoyed bushwacking around the pond, it 
was so much fun.  Most of the boxes we usually find are pretty close to the 
trail, so we loved the added challenge.  This box was also in place and in 
great condition.  Several visitors have been to this beautiful 
location.  Still baffled by Rolling Rock we headed for the Kimball 
Library.  We made it in plenty of time to find the box.  Although the 
librarian who was there thought we were crazy when we asked about it.  But 
she was very willing to let us look where ever we wanted, so we found it!  
It was great to be able to stamp in.  We found the virtual letterbook, but 
nothing beats finding the actual box.  Thanks Tom.</div>
<div>    After lunch with our brand new 
Valley Quest book in hand, we headed out to New Hampshire where we found several 
boxes in Plainfield and Cornish.  We explored a small town, an old mill, a 
great covered bridge, and an old, beautiful church.  Sunday we visited 
Fairlee and Thetford Vermont where we visited a peregrene falcon nesting site, a 
cool waterfall, and an old train depot.  On the Miraculous Tree Quest we 
learned about all different types of trees and used their measurements to find 
the treasure box by a mystery tree.  We also walked the streets of Thetford 
Hill to discover many old houses and buildings.  Today we reluctantly 
packed up our things to head for home.  We decided to make one last stop in 
Grafton VT.  This was one of the most peaceful, beautiful villages we have 
ever visited.  We walked the streets, then travelled through a small park 
up into the forest.  As we walked we found small gazebos built in the 
1920's and even a cave!  </div>
<div>    If anyone can get up to the upper 
valley in VT or NH you should really buy a quest book and search out some of 
these boxes.  As visitors we really enjoy learning about the amazing pasts 
of the towns as well as some of the hidden places that typical tourists never 
know about.</div>
<div>    Hope everyone else avoided the rain 
and had a great weekend.</div>
