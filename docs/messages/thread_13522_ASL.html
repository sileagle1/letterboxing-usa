Send your translation to Wanda and Pete.  I tried to translate it for<br/>
them and  was not familiar with a few of the hand positions . Took it to<br/>
class and neither was my teacher. I wrote to Ledger de maine as asked<br/>
what book "he" used and never  got an answer back.  Pete and Wanda were<br/>
told that I was very wrong.!! Like any other clues, --it is all in the<br/>
interruption  !!<br/>
