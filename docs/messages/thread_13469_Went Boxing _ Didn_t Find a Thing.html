Funny, I use A to denote the number of Anacondas (consentual reality <br/>
or not) I have overcome in my quest for bits of handcarved rubber.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone knows L is for Lizards. Wait, A is for Amy who fell down the <br/>
stairs; B is for Basil, devoured by bears... A bit of whimsy from <br/>
Edward Gorey for all you doubtful guests out there.<br/>
<br/>
Went to a delightful party last night (thank you VERY MUCH, Sadie <br/>
from Nebraska and Dave!) whose hostess had carved and planted a stamp <br/>
nearby. This is the Mill St. one in San Luis Obispo, CA. Incredibly <br/>
pretty carving, well worth the find. Easy clues and wheelchair <br/>
accessible.<br/>
<br/>
We returned the favor by carving a stamp (I designed and JugglerMouse <br/>
carved) at the party. Since we had six of 100**100D (Googled) there, <br/>
we are counting it as our first E stamp for event. Sade from Nebraska <br/>
will be planting it soon so you all can get an impression of it. <br/>
<br/>
No one at the event broke anything except a non-boxing guest who went <br/>
into a Koi pond to try to save a lighted juggling ball. His cell <br/>
phone looked broken thereafter.<br/>
<br/>
100**100D are now mostly okay with an early October date for a <br/>
gathering open to all 'boxers who wish to attend. Later in October <br/>
and we get rain. If Ryan is here, we will advertise it that way. <br/>
Otherwise, visitors may have to just content themselves with hunting <br/>
in a very densely populated letterboxing environment in a very lovely <br/>
area. <br/>
<br/>
Just reporting the happenings. Will let you know about that smiling <br/>
turtle guy as soon as I hear.<br/>
