hints? Can it be done?    <br/>
<br/>
I think perhaps links to a map within clues is best done by your own <br/>
web space and some HTML editing.... something I am not well versed <br/>
in. Which brings me to another question... is anyone using the <br/>
Geocities free web page offer from Yahoo! to put clues on the net?? <br/>
If so, have you been able to upload photos? If so, I need to pick <br/>
your brain, so email me off list!!!<br/>

&gt; refering to mohmers question, the trick is to set a link in a clue <br/>
to a <br/>
&gt; part of the talk list that is a members-only section. How would one <br/>
do <br/>
&gt; this without being a member to view the link? I'm not sure it's <br/>
&gt; possible. The link would instead have to come from an outside <br/>
source <br/>
&gt; that is publically available, unless I'm mistaken. &gt; Mark<br/>
