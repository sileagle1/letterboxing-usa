The Monument box was not covered with its rock, though it was high <br/>
and dry. The Lost Lake box was fine.<br/>

We need to exercise constant vigilence when replacing letterboxes <br/>
with integrity intact.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, I just started letterboxing. I live in northwest CT. I see that there<br/>
are many to search for.  I spent last weekend in RI and went looking for<br/>
several that were close to where I was. I found only one of the three.<br/>
<br/>
I could not locate the Beavertail Light box even though I'm sure I was at<br/>
the right spot ( and have the poison ivy to show for it). Next I looked for<br/>
the Point Judith Light box. I found the hole, but there was nothing in it.<br/>
The grass had been recently cut. Do you suppose the grounds crew removed it?<br/>
Next I went searching for the Galilee letterbox. And found it! Thank<br/>
heavens, because I was getting a little discouraged. I'm looking forward to<br/>
finding more.<br/>

Bummer, that was the very first box we ever placed.  I am not sure <br/>
when we will be getting down there.  If anyone is planning on going <br/>
and would let me know I would be happy to send a replacement book to <br/>
them with our stamps in it (and 2 extra, heavy duty freezer ziplocks).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the notice, Aili.<br/>
