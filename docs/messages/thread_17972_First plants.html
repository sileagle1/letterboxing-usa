One thing I like to see is enough room so that the lid is not hard to get /<br/>
keep on and also if you want to ever see a hitchhiker in it there has to be<br/>
enough room for that.  I found a number of great boxes over at our local dollar<br/>
store - heavy duty and good sealing lids.  And big enough for the logbook,<br/>
stamp and ink pad and a hitchhiker!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I noticed that some of the Hefty/Gladware type boxes with the lighter lids did<br/>
not fare well over time aorund here, so am nixing those now...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah they don't hack it for very long at all.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Second, Log books.  Any input would be appreciated.  Don't know why I am stuck<br/>

<br/>
LOL  We prefer the ones where the pages are not paper but like index card<br/>
material.  They hold up better, if they get damp they don't fall apart and<br/>
again I found a bunch of them for $1.00 each at our local dollar store!  Sense<br/>
a theme here??  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

      I found some cheap photo albums ($1.00) and filled<br/>
them with index cards.  Works for me.  Also, about<br/>
25% of the boxes I've found have ranged from damp<br/>
to completely flooded.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">While I haven't yet officially started letterboxing, I am an avid geocacher<br/>
and have happened upon letterboxes in my cache searching.  (It's always<br/>
exciting to find them!)  We have only one letterbox in town at this point<br/>
and I'm saving the find for a truly needed moment.<br/>
<br/>
I was writing IRT storage containers.  Geocaching and LB definitely have<br/>
the camouflage hide/waterproof container needs in common.  One of the best<br/>
_plastic_ non-armed forces related containers I've seen is called a Lock &amp;<br/>
Lock.  They come in a whole slew of sizes but they have a rubber gasket in<br/>
the lid and then four tabs on the top that flip down where they then 'lock'<br/>
over a part of the body on the container.  There is no way water will get<br/>
into these boxes in the field unless it's put in there.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, they are hard to find, at least out here in the PNW, but<br/>
I've most recently been excited to see them at Target.  They don't have a<br/>
great selection of sizes, so the choice is VERY limited.  They are in their<br/>
plastic food storage section near the tupperware/sterilite/rubbermaid goo.<br/>
<br/>
You can also try this link:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.lockandlockusa.com<br/>
<br/>
It will take you to some place called Heritage Mint, but give you their<br/>
Lock &amp; Lock sets, where they have a MUCH better size selection.<br/>

rubber seal arould the lid, and stand up to the environment well.  <br/>
The 1.7 pt is the smallest that can fit the usual contents.  HH's <br/>
would not fit very well.  The 1.2 qt is used a lot in Connecticut.  <br/>
It can fit a HH with a little squeeze.  The 1.7 qt has lots of room <br/>
for a HH, but it would depend on your hiding spot.  It may need a <br/>
larger hole to hide it.<br/>

I usually use spiral bound index cards for the log book.  No bleed <br/>
through of the ink.  I usually get a three pack of 50 cards per <br/>
book.  Staples or one of the office supply stores have them.<br/>
