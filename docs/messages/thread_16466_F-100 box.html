I was admonished at the recent SLO Letterboxing Event when I <br/>
mistakenly pronounced your name.  I was told it was correctly <br/>
pronounced Kraw-pee-fisher-girl (kraw as in rhyming with bra). When <br/>
are you heading back out to Pasadena to find the rest of my Eaton <br/>
Canyon Stamps? The rattlesnakes will be hibernating soon, and I've <br/>
planted an additional nine boxes around town?<br/>
