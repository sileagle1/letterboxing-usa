Here is what has happened to it so far:<br/>
<br/>
10/20/02 started at the Two Birders Letterbox in E.C. Lawrence Park, <br/>
Virginia, by ADG<br/>
<br/>
The log book doesn't say what date it was found.  The finders didn't <br/>
stamp in their personal stamp.<br/>
<br/>
11/3/03 moved to Let's Have a Picnic, Macsville, VA, by Daphne's <br/>
Family &amp; Lizzy<br/>
<br/>
11/9/02 found by Mary from Virginia.<br/>
<br/>
What will happen next?<br/>
