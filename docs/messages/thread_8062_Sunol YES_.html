                    <div class="plaintext-content">Randy, I found your Sunol box today with my brother(an orienteer).We <br/>
were the FIRST to log in. Great hike! This was a first letterbox find <br/>
for my brother. I think he had a blast hiking up the steep fire road <br/>
and walking right to your box. He remembers running down the road on <br/>
one of his orienteering meets. <br/>
I did carve a stamp for this box as requested, but I just didn't feel <br/>
like following the directions today. I thought that some other west <br/>
coast boxers may enjoy seeing your stamp. I did leave an impression <br/>
of my stamp in the log book. One day when I am out there hiking <br/>
again, I will try to remember to check on the box and then make the <br/>
exchange. <br/>
