<br/>
I wouldn't blame you if you thought the letterbox was missing, <br/>
because the clue is wrong!  =)  That's the box about the "seventh" <br/>
disk or something like that, right?  Try looking closer to the fourth <br/>
one instead.  It could be missing--I haven't been out there for <br/>
well over a year now--but it took me forever to find the darned box <br/>
because the clue was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to get the Tryon Creek Ophan box while you're at it, I <br/>
know Wendy's link isn't working, but you could try e-mailing her <br/>
for the clue.  (She told me months ago she'd get them <br/>
fixed--someday.  *rolling eyes*)  I don't save clues when I'm done <br/>
with them, so while I know where the box is (was?), I don't <br/>
remember the clues to get to them!  Anyhow, if you need her <br/>
e-mail address, let me know.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
I don't know....  Even after I found the box I tried to figure out how <br/>
he came up with the number seven and probably looked in every <br/>
nook and cranny by behind every tree half a dozen times.  But <br/>
regardless, if I had that much trouble seeing three of the <br/>
disks--and I *know* others have had that problem too--I'd still <br/>
recommend counting only to four to make up for the three that <br/>
can't be seen!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, like I said before, it's been a long time since I've been <br/>
out there, and the box could very well be missing!<br/>
