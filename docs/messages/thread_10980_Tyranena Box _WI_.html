posted, new steps were built at the park.  You must go halfway down the<br/>
steps then turn left.  Also, the 20 paces given is really 40 steps/paces.<br/>
<br/>
The Fort Atkinson Box was missing when I searched for it both around<br/>
Thanksgiving and after Christmas.  Whoever placed the box should find a<br/>
better place to replace it at.  The original spot is too much out in the<br/>
open where "hoodlums" roam.  I'm sure the box was disposed of quickly after<br/>
it was placed.<br/>
