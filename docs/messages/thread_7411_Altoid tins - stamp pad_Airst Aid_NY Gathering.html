<br/>
I see you've had lots of great responses to this original post - and here's <br/>
a bit more!  If you consume Altoids like I do, replacements for rusted tins <br/>
are not an issue ;&gt;  Also, while I agree that you don't really need to <br/>
include an ink pad, I think that a "spot" dye ink pad might fit.  These are <br/>
itty bitty pads, about 1 5/16" square by about 3/4" high - flat lid, not <br/>
humped like the cat's eyes (I also prefer dye to pigment ink).  The Altoid <br/>
tins in my purse (peppermint AND cinnamon) measure just over 3/4" <br/>
high.  I've seen this size in craft sections of several stores.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, carry a small first aid kit at all times (2 rough and ready kids, <br/>
one or the other always bleeding).  I found it at a Tupperware party last <br/>
fall - a set of two were about $10, and although the shape is a bit odd <br/>
(sort of rounded triangular), one holds several antiseptic wipes, a mess of <br/>
bandaids, and a tube of neosporin.  (The Tupperware lady demonstrated it <br/>
with a compact and lipstick in it hahahahahah - having just fished the <br/>
umpteenth nasty bandaid out of the bottom of my purse, I immediately saw <br/>
it's true calling!)   When letterboxing, it transfers from my purse to the <br/>
small backpack we carry.  Last weekend we found that the pain reliever <br/>
neosporin works really well on bug bites.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we'd like to see a NY-area gathering, so keep up the planning <br/>
discussion!<br/>

&gt;Hello all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This rainy cool CT night, I am experimenting with an Altoid tin trying to <br/>
&gt;turn it into a letterbox. Small stamp (Factis eraser cut to ~ 1.5"x1"x <br/>
&gt;.5") fits. Handmade logbook fits. Weatherproofing will be accomplished by <br/>
&gt;doubling up heavy-duty ziplocks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now...the problem. I have one of those small eye-shaped stamp pads, a <br/>
&gt;perfect size for this stamp. There is no way the pad will fit in the tin. <br/>
&gt;It is too high to enable me to close the cover. In the unique scenario I <br/>
&gt;am envisioning for this particular letterbox, a stamp pad separate from <br/>
&gt;and outside the tin is not really possible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone have any other ideas? Has anyone ever made a stamp pad that <br/>
&gt;could be sized to fit and if so, out of what combination of materials?. <br/>
&gt;Would anyone compromise and stamp labels instead and include them rather <br/>
&gt;than a stamp pad? This seems somewhat non-traditional, but I guess if I <br/>
&gt;have to..........<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Help!!!!!<br/>
