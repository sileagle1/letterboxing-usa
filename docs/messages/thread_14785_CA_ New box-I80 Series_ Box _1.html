Yesterday we planted a series of 5 boxes on Interstate 80 between Auburn and <br/>
Truckee, Calif. We're listing them separately. The series takes you 70 miles <br/>
one way on interstate 80 and only about 6 miles total off the freeway for the <br/>
boxes. Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
You've heard of Route 66? Well, U.S. 40 was a highway stretching from <br/>
Harrison Street in Downtown San Francisco all the way Atlantic City, NJ way back <br/>
when. It is one of the most important and historic highways in the U.S. It was the <br/>
first federally funded road ad comprised the western half of the Lincoln <br/>
Highway. From 1926 to 1964, U.S. 40 was a transcontinental highway and its route <br/>
covered a lot of American history. It went next to the Oregon Trail and the <br/>
ruts from the covered wagons could be seen from cars going down the road at high <br/>
speeds. The highway followed in many places the route of the ill-fated Donner <br/>
party and went through the pass that bears their name. It also went right <br/>
next to Sutter's MIll in Sacramento where the discovery of gold changed the <br/>
course of US history. <br/>
<br/>
Before Interstate 80 was built in the late 60s, you had to take this highway <br/>
to get to Lake Tahoe. Old Blue made this day-long trip from the S.F. Bay area <br/>
many times in his youth and this I-80 series commemorates these trips. So, if <br/>
you're traveling to (or from) Lake Tahoe, we hope this series will entertain <br/>
you. For the 5 boxes in this series, you'll only log about 6 miles off the <br/>
freeway! <br/>
<br/>
Box #1 Old U.S. 40 <br/>
Rating<br/>
Clues: Easy<br/>
Terrain: paved, easy<br/>
Distance: one mile drive off the freeway, and you can see the boxes hiding <br/>
place from your parked car.<br/>
<br/>
To the box: Exit Maple Street off I-80 in Auburn, Ca. Bear left and up the <br/>
hill. You are now on the Lincoln Hwy. Follow the signs for the Lincoln Highway, <br/>
aka Old U.S. 40, through downtown Auburn until you spy a "bell and flag". Stop <br/>
and park. Go greet the "Chinese Coolie". From behind his right foot, take a <br/>
bearing of 300 degrees and proceed 14 paces. On your left, you should spy a <br/>
large quartz rock half covered by landscaping. The box is on the north side of <br/>
this rock hidden by a flat rock at ground level, just under the bush.<br/>
<br/>
Note: There is a Southern Pacific railroad caboose to look at here and the <br/>
Chamber of Commerce is a stone's throw away so you can get tons of information <br/>
on this very historic city. The old courthouse and museum is a treasure trove <br/>
of California history too!<br/>
