                    <div class="plaintext-content">The McQ road trip through VT and MA was quite a success even though our <br/>
letterboxing attempts along the way were not very fruitful. We spent an <br/>
hour and a half searching the sun-dappled woods of North Bennington, VT for <br/>
Funhog's Hip Hop Box but came up empty-handed. We did, however, spot five <br/>
gnomes, two frogs and a gargoyle along the way (even a gnome and a frog <br/>
sharing a pipe in the crook of a mossy tree). The search for gnomes was <br/>
almost more exciting than the search for the box, and helped convince the <br/>
not-so-enthusiastic McQ among us that letterboxing can actually be fun.<br/>
<br/>
We stopped in Lincoln, MA to search for the Two Hearts box later that <br/>
afternoon. Having been there before, I was fairly sure I knew exactly where <br/>
to look, but unfortunately that same place has become a massive dumping <br/>
ground for raked up leaves, hedge trimmings and downed branches. We didn't <br/>
have time for a more extensive search, so if the box *is* where I think it <br/>
is, it might now be covered by the landscaping crew's refuse. Due to <br/>
massive rush hour traffic and a bone-chilling wind, we ran out of time and <br/>
resolve to try for both the Battle Trail box in Concord and the Solitude <br/>
mystery box that were also on our list.<br/>
<br/>
On our return trip home to NY, we had to skip the Gloucester and Boston <br/>
Public Garden boxes we'd planned for, but I did leave behind the Shooting <br/>
Star and Bull Frog Pond boxes in Rockport, MA. Both of these boxes are <br/>
orphans, so if any locals feel like adopting them for me, I'd be most <br/>
appreciative.<br/>
