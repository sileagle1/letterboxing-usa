is probably another one you've gotten many times...<br/>
I went to altasquest.com and recorded my first find, but the hitchhiker <br/>

letterboxing.org).  Is there anywhere else to record found boxes?  I <br/>
would just especially like to make it known that these are still in <br/>
their locations in case anyone else is worried they might not be.  <br/>
Also, thought the hitchhiker owner would like to know where it has <br/>
ended up.  Couldn't find anything on it like a website or anything.  <br/>
Any suggestions or is that just the way it is sometimes?  Thanks again!<br/>

Welcome to Letterboxing!  Yes, HH should be released soon after you<br/>
find one and I think someone else wrote that one week is acceptable to<br/>
hold onto one.  Not all boxes are listed on both LB.org AND on AQ.com.<br/>
 So neither site will ever have your true counts. This doesn't make a<br/>
difference to me as my personal log as my acurate count.  You can<br/>
contact the placers by clicking the links from either group's website.<br/>
 Locate the page for the box or hh and you should find the contact the<br/>
placer link there.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps. If you have any other questions about getting<br/>
started with letterboxing, feel free to email me.<br/>

  Actually premium members at Atlas Quest can record all of their finds (listed or not) and keep a true count electronically. See 'Atlas Quest Subscriptions' for more information: <br/>

If you found the boxes though AQ or LB.org use the contact the placer function to let the <br/>
placer know the conditon of the box. As for HH's, alot of them are just not recorded <br/>
anywhere.<br/>
