&gt; &gt; I drove on to Ft Worden and am sorry to report that all of the<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Amanda told me that her boxes were pulled by the authorities <br/>
there.  <br/>
&gt; She got an e-mail a little while box from them saying as much and <br/>
&gt; what to do if she wanted to reclaim them.  (She has no plans to, as <br/>
&gt; far as I know.)  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I never heard anything about Candlelight's boxes, presumeably <br/>
&gt; they've pulled her boxes as well and she's already aware of their <br/>
&gt; status.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone else planning to hide boxes at Fort Worden would be advised <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; make them mystery boxes or not post the clues to this website.  <br/>
It's <br/>
&gt; an awesome place to visit, and it's a shame not have anymore boxes <br/>
&gt; there.  Letterboxing at Fort Worden will have to go 'underground'.<br/>

I hope that's a good thing....  =)<br/>

<br/>
I'm not actually sure I've ever posted it anywhere in the archives, <br/>
so the search probably wouldn't have been fruitful anyhow.  =)  Most <br/>
people find it by 'accident' following links from my clues or any <br/>
other pages which eventually lead to the main page.  <br/>
