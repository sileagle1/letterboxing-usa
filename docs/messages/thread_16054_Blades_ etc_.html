It might be a good idea to be careful regarding where Xacto blades <br/>
(&amp; similar equipment) are carried or sent.  We travel quite a bit &amp; <br/>
also go to meetings in federal, state, county &amp; city buildings where <br/>
there are security check points.  I've adjusted to making sure all <br/>
our small scissors, knives, etc. are not going through a security <br/>
check point.  <br/>
<br/>
There could be a problem with blades sent to certain countries.<br/>
<br/>
And, speaking of metal detectors, don't forget, don't put metal <br/>
items in the LBs.  People who go treasure hunting with metal <br/>
detectors would get excited unnecessarily.<br/>
