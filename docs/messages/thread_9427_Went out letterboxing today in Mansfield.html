                    <html><body>I went letterboxing today and found 17 out of 21 boxes of My Favorite Musicals series.  I did not find Louisa, Oklahoma, The Hills are Alive, and Shirley Temple.  Some were under rocks under the snow.  The snow definitely made things difficult!  Of course, I'm glad it is now snowing so my footprints are being covered up!
<br/>I also found Ponde Place, after waiting about 15 minutes for a woman and her son to finish playing by the pond!
<br/>
<br/>Tomorrow, off to a couple of Wanda and Pete Mystery boxes on my way to the beach house!
