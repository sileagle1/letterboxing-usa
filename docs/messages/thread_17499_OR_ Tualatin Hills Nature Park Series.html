                    <div class="plaintext-content">It is my understanding that there was a recent gathering to replace <br/>
some of the missing boxes in this series. Did it happen and does <br/>
anyone have the current status of the boxes. I have contacted Thom <br/>
and he mentioned about the gathering but since he was out of town he <br/>
didn't have a more current status yet.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to hit this series of boxes on my whirlwind trip to the <br/>
Portland area on MLK weekend and would like to know which ones are <br/>
there or missing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
