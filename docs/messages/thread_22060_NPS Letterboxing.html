<br/>
Yet another example of disproving the lie of letterboxing not being <br/>
allowed on NPS property.  The same goes with USF&amp;WS land, but you're <br/>
not likely to get approval for ANYthing not related to wildlife <br/>
conservation there.<br/>
<br/>
I'd also stress that most likely each and every box will have to have <br/>
permission.  Don't assume that one box is in there, it's automatically <br/>
okay for more to go in.  You can assume, however, that the hard part of <br/>
explaining letterboxing has already been done, so don't hesitate to ask!<br/>
<br/>
I would also ask that everyone monitor their boxes closely.  The more <br/>
boxes on NPS land that show to have absolutely no problem the better.  <br/>
That way when the director starts polling the different parks, they can <br/>
give postive responses.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's definitely case by case. NPS requires a permit to place a<br/>
letterbox in a national park. The park supervisor has complete<br/>
latitude to accept or deny each permit application as they see fit.<br/>
They have to weigh whether the potential benefit of bringing more<br/>
people to the park outweigh the risks to sensitive wildlife or<br/>
historical structures. The standard permit application fee is $100 but<br/>
the have the option to waive or reduce the fee, as was done in this case.<br/>
