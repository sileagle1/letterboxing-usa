near bike trails.  <br/>
<br/>
There is one near the East Falls Church Metro station along the bike <br/>
trail along I-66, can't remember the trail name.  The box is "Ghost <br/>
Castle of East Falls Church".  <br/>
<br/>
When that trail turns into the W@OD trail it passes very near to Dunn <br/>
Loring Park in Vienna, VA that has a couple boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
There are other boxes in Vienna but I am not sure how close to the <br/>
trail they are.  Except for for Clark's Crossing in Vienna which is <br/>
close to the trail and very bikable.<br/>
<br/>
In Reston, along the W&amp;OD, Furry Woodland Creature and Christmas Tree <br/>
Graveyards is doable by mountain bike from the W&amp;OD.<br/>
<br/>
I have some W&amp;OD box planting plans that have been waiting for bike <br/>
weather.<br/>
<br/>
If you include the Mall in DC as part of a bike trail all of the ones <br/>
on the mall are bikable to.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Can anyone recommend letterboxing series along a bike trail?  <br/>
&gt; Eastern <br/>
&gt; &gt; US preferable, but I'll take all comers!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; The Bike it or Hike it web page lists bike trails in CT-MA-RI-NJ-VA-<br/>
&gt; MD-DC that all contain letterboxes along the trails. Visit <br/>
&gt; (www.geocities.com/haalck@s...). We are taking another trip down <br/>
&gt; to DC in April and plan to add more along the way.<br/>
