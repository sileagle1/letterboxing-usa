(thanks so much, MO UR4ME) I didn't think I'd get any more boxing in <br/>
(because there just aren't any more around here to get that I am <br/>
aware of.  However, I did work on carving for my "epic" series - <br/>
eight stamps and counting!  I hope to spend some time in Forest Park <br/>
during lunch hours this week (if the weather holds out) to start <br/>
seeking out appropriate hidey-holes.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, yard work.  Yeah, good times; good times.  But the front <br/>
yard looks good - ready for holiday lights next weekend.  This is <br/>
the first year since we bought the house that we're decorating <br/>
outdoors, so I'm really looking forward to it!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Today - another gorgeous day in what has been a spectacularly <br/>
beautiful long weekend! After my sweetie served me a pancake <br/>
breakfast in bed, we hung out a bit; I chatted on the phone about a <br/>
particularly tricky new box plant with geckospot; then we headed out <br/>
to one of the south county parks for a nice long hike. When we got <br/>
there, the parking area was almost full - I guess other folks had <br/>
the same idea!<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I did manage to make this letterboxing-related. I've gotten <br/>
all the boxes in my area except for a couple of new ones across the <br/>
mightly Mississippi(about a half-hour away) AND a newly-announced <br/>
box just over the county line (only a 15-minute drive - yay!) so I <br/>
guess I know what I'm doing NEXT weekend! On this hike, I got <br/>
the "Maple Leaf Box" planted. I still need to find a park/trail map <br/>
on-line so as to give proper directions in my clues, but suffice to <br/>
say, this puppy is not a drive-by! We hiked between 3 and 4 miles, <br/>
uphill and down, on fairly rocky terrain. M said this was one of his <br/>
favorite places to mountain bike back in the day, and I can see why! <br/>
(Altho personally, I would never attempt this kind of trail on a <br/>
bike - I know I'd take a header into a boulder. Also, some of those <br/>
uphill sections were challenging enough on foot!) To support my <br/>
addiction, M suggested I make a couple more boxes for this trail, <br/>
and said he'd love to go back for another hike in a couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I think there's enough time to at least google the park <br/>
map...it's getting late, so clueage is just gonna have to wait. Can <br/>
I just say right now that I love this hobby? I wish there was more <br/>
activity around here, but I'll just keep working on my plants and <br/>
hope others continue to do the same!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of addictions...I'm planning another new box that will be <br/>
entitled "My OTHER Addiction". There's a graphic or two out there <br/>
that I'm itchin' to carve...<br/>
<br/>
I hope y'all had a safe, happy and splendid holiday weekend, and got <br/>
outside (and away from the computer - LOL!) to enjoy our sport!<br/>
