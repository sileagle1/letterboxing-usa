                   Loch Ness Monster, Nokkon Wud<br/>
<br/>
Placed Sept. 2002, Exeter, Rhode Island (Washington County)<br/>
<br/>
About 3 1/2 miles round trip.  Nice walk with a little mud and roots <br/>
in Nokkon Wud territory........  <br/>
<br/>
Hidden by Mike and Christine<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   Park at the trailhead for the John B. Hudson trail.  This can be <br/>
found up a short dirt road off of Rt. 165, about 2.4 miles from <br/>
Rt.3.  There is a sign on Rt. 165 for the trail.  A short ride up <br/>
this dirt road will lead to the trailhead/parking area.<br/>
<br/>
LOCH NESS MONSTER<br/>
<br/>
To begin your quest, start following the yellow blazed trail that <br/>
begins at the parking area at the wooden sign.  You will follow this <br/>
yellow blazed trail for about 1.5 miles.  You will pass thru a stone <br/>
wall, past Rhode Island Historic Cemetary #101, always following the <br/>
yellow blazes, crossing a woods road.  Follow the yellow blazes, <br/>
coming to a T intersection, continue to follow the yellow blazes left <br/>
a short ways, then left again and follow the yellow blazes till you <br/>
emerge into an open area with a large body of water to the north.  <br/>
Take some time to enjoy the view. Leave the blazes for now.  Follow <br/>
the dirt road to the left, over the bridge with the waterfall to your <br/>
right, continue on the dirt road until you reach a red gate, pass <br/>
thru the gate, with the body of water to the east.  Notice two stone <br/>
walls on your left shortly after the gate.  Continue on the trail and <br/>
you will see a 3rd stone wall on the left.  Continue and pass a half <br/>
rotted upright tree on the left of the trail (a culvert passes <br/>
beneath you).  When you see the next stone wall (4th), bushwack 34 <br/>
paces west along this wall from the trail.  The Loch Ness Monster is <br/>
hidden in the stone wall here.  At his hiding spot you should see a <br/>
large pine tree with lots of broken branches on its bottom half at 36 <br/>
degrees.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
NOKKON WUD<br/>
<br/>
  On to Nokkon Wud.  Tread carefully!  To begin your search, retrace <br/>
your steps back to the bridge/waterfall.  After recrossing the <br/>
bridge, look to your right and you should notice some white blazes.  <br/>
Over some rocks in the ground and crossing the threshold into Nokkon <br/>
Wuds magical domain.  You should see the stream to your right.  <br/>
Follow the white blazes (one of many white blazed trails in Nokkon <br/>
Wuds territory). At a Y intersection, go left, following the white <br/>
blazes, up a small hill, past a large rotted tree on left of the <br/>
trail.  Can you hear Nokkon Wud?  Over a log, past two fallen trees <br/>
across the stream to the right.  Has Nokkon Wud seen you?  Up a <br/>
rocky/muddy bit.  You will come to a knee high small wooden post on <br/>
the left of the trail.  Is that Nokkon Wud there, thru the trees?   <br/>
Continue on until the trail goes left up a rocky ravine, away from <br/>
stream.  Nokkon Wud is near.  Past a birch tree in middle of trail, <br/>
over a fallen tree, up to another tree in the middle of the trail <br/>
with a white blaze on it which is right before another fallen tree <br/>
across trail.  From the this white blazed tree in the middle of the <br/>
trail, look north, about 14 paces you should see a smallish boulder <br/>
in the ground.  On the NE side of the boulder there is a tree which <br/>
at its base you will find the lair of Nokkon Wud.<br/>
<br/>
     "Nokkon Wud is an evil spirit, probably Scandinavian in nature, <br/>
whose sole job is to listen for people challenging the fates by <br/>
rashly making factual observations. 'Break a leg!', he would hear <br/>
someone say, immediately followed by, 'Knock on Wood' and Nokkon <br/>
would swoop invisibly into their homes in the dead of night and give <br/>
their lives a stir for the worse.<br/>
<br/>
     Some say Nokkon Wud looks like a Goblin and is very big and can <br/>
stomp hard enough to shake the ground into earthquakes and volcanoes <br/>
and has a voice like Thunder.  Some say he is very little and sounds <br/>
as if he were Welsh.  Some say Nokkon Wud is normal sized.  They are <br/>
quite rare...Some, never see him at all....."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After "meeting" Nokkon Wud, continue on the trail to a 4 way <br/>
intersection.  Take the south trail and continue across a small woods <br/>
road, staying on this trail which will eventually lead back to the <br/>
parking area. <br/>
