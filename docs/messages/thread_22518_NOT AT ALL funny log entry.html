Joy. Please do not take this as a "flame" as I am not trying to attack<br/>
anyone on a personal level. I only mean this note as an attempt to<br/>
raise awareness. <br/>
<br/>
As terrible as that log entry is, it is a situation which allows the<br/>
finder to remain in control of reading it or not. A rapist does not<br/>
allow another to have ANY control of the situation. <br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, it is unlikely that reading offensive comments would<br/>
generate nightmares, day terrors or cause a drastic alteration in the<br/>
way you view the world. It surely would cause you to need medical<br/>
treatment, involve law enforcement, cause you to miss work or have to<br/>
tell your story in an open court room.  All of which can and do occur<br/>
when someone has been sexually assulted.<br/>
<br/>
This is kind of like re-visiting the Purple Heart letterbox thing, I<br/>
know, but words ARE powerful and they DO matter. <br/>

&gt; Well, I found a box with a not-at-all-funny note in<br/>
&gt; it.  An apparent noxer (no stamp or trail name) wrote<br/>
&gt; an eight page racist diatribe in the logbook,<br/>
&gt; advocating violence against certain races, cultures<br/>
&gt; and entire countries, with the goal of eliminating<br/>
&gt; them and leaving this country for his/her PURE race. <br/>
&gt; I couldn't read the whole thing-I just couldn't<br/>
&gt; stomach it.  They referred to themself as one of "the<br/>
&gt; true patriots."  <br/>

Hi PI<br/>
<br/>
Better that said than"What a dumb stamp". I've had people complain <br/>
about the size of my stamp as well as the location. There are jerks <br/>
in every aspect of life.Just remember the others that enjoyed the <br/>
box.<br/>
BTW there has been some chatter on the LbNCA list about Hog Heaven. <br/>
Apparantly there was one box(container) that had to be replaced as <br/>
it split its britches. It seems as though the contents were just too <br/>
big and elaborate. That piggy has a new home that is even bigger.<br/>

something that you are forced to do.  <br/>

If you don't like the place where the box was placed then stop looking for  <br/>
it.  If you don't like the stamp then don't "defile" your journal with the  <br/>
stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness that these kinds of comments are probably VERY rare and most  <br/>
letterboxers appreciate the time and effort that went into placing boxes for <br/>
all  of our enjoyment.  Take care all....GlobeBear<br/>
