<br/>
&gt; Hey! Just wondering if the avid letterboxing almost-threesome of<br/>
&gt; Tate, Sue, and newborn are well? Did you guys have your baby yet? Did<br/>
&gt; you get a kiddie backpack and take her out hiking yet? Hope you are<br/>
&gt; all well and happy!<br/>

I'd recommend the Kelty backpacks.  We have a Kelty Town backpack
and it's great for short jaunts around the town and in small woods, but
the higher end Keltys are supposed to be much more comfortable which I
think is more practical for hiking.
