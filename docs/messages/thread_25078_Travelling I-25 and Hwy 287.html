<br/>
I would recommend checking LbNA by the counties along Hwy 287, at least after you get into Texas.  There was a recent push to get the Texas Panhandle populated with letterboxes, so there is at least one in every county along your route, although they may not be close to the highway.<br/>
Once you get to the Dallas/Ft. Worth area, there are many great boxes.<br/>
