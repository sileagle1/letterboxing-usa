well as on the weekend, especially as there are other demands on our <br/>
weekend hours as well.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, we've visited:<br/>
The first three Peanuts boxes in Redding (it was too hot to keep <br/>
going)<br/>
The Cemetery &amp; Beanstalk boxes in Cromwell<br/>
Bauer Farm in Madison<br/>
Bittner Trail in Guilford<br/>
The #2 Series of Presidents in Middlebury<br/>
and we've peeked in on the Quinny Linear Trail boxes in Wallingford <br/>
(Butterfly's and our own).<br/>
Trout Fishing &amp; Watermelon Sugar in Mansfield.<br/>
<br/>
All of the above are in good condition, except poor Marcy has detached <br/>
her head, and the two Mansfield log books are full to the brim.<br/>
