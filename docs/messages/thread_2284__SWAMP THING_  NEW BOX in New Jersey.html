"SWAMP THING" LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Location: ESTELL MANOR PARK, 109 Rte. 50, Mays Landing NJ (Atlantic <br/>
County)<br/>
<br/>
Rating: Easy  2.5 - 3 miles, flat terrain<br/>
<br/>
Placed: February, 2001 by "V+V"<br/>
<br/>
We chose this lovely park in South Jersey to plant our first <br/>
letterbox. It's about 30 minutes west of Atlantic City, part of the <br/>
Atlantic County Park system. There are numerous points of interest <br/>
within its boundaries, including the foundation ruins of an old World <br/>
War I munitions factory, an old glassworks site, a playground, boat <br/>
launch, nature center, and observation deck. So wander the woods and <br/>
enjoy the trails as you seek the box (and try not to think about what <br/>
you lost at the casino!)<br/>
<br/>
Note: A park trail map is recommended, but not necessary. (Available <br/>
at the nature center.) Some trail sections can bee very muddy in <br/>
spring!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Park at the Nature Center, and begin on the asphalt path to your left <br/>
as you face the front of the building. Take the path at 160 degrees <br/>
and pass the now-extinct Katsura tree on your right.<br/>
<br/>
Soon you'll pass over a small wooden bridge. At the fork, bear 210. <br/>
At the next fork, turn left 115 degrees east onto the LAUREL TRAIL.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the Laurel Trail, passing post #'s 9, 10, 7, and 11 as you <br/>
weave through beautiful mountain laurel, longleaf pine, and huge <br/>
American Holly. When it intersects at a "T" with the CENTER TRAIL, <br/>
turn left here 60 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't quite Atlantic City's Boardwalk, but it will guide you <br/>
safely through this maple swamp. Beware of trolls under the bridge!<br/>
<br/>
As you cross the road, stay straight on the trail. Note the name <br/>
changes to "MISTLETOE". Resist the urge to take the large fork on the <br/>
right as it comes up. Stay your course and keep a sharp eye out for a <br/>
small sign on your left (on a tree): "TO FOOTBRIDGE". Take this trail <br/>
on your left at 15 degrees. This bridge will keep you out of mud and <br/>
muck!<br/>
<br/>
Have your arrived at the Sandhole Road signboard? At this junction, <br/>
choose the center trail to your right; it is the SWAMP TRAIL at 140 <br/>
degrees. Look for a "211" sign on tree as landmark. You're headed for <br/>
another boardwalk!<br/>
<br/>
As you amble along the boards, enjoy the cedars and pitch pine, <br/>
sweetgum, and maple. What you seek is not far ahead!<br/>
<br/>
Way down the boardwalk, it bends to a 15 degree angle. The Swamp <br/>
Thing lives under here, just by your left foot! LOOK AROUND  is <br/>
anyone coming? If the coast is clear, hop off the boards and reach <br/>
underneath. The box rests on a support beam at the edge. <br/>
Congratulations! Stamp in!<br/>
<br/>
GETTING BACK: You can always retrace the way you came, but why not <br/>
make a circuit and enjoy the ruins, the river, the cemetery, and more?<br/>
<br/>
Continue along the boardwalk to the end (do NOT fork off to the left <br/>
at the new signboard). Pass marker #234 and come to a "T". Go left  <br/>
(due west) and explore the old Powerhouse ruins, artesian well and <br/>
Smith-Ireland cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
You'll come upon a large clearing and campfire area. Take the dirt <br/>
road to the left (ARTESIAN WELL RD.) leading away from the boat ramp. <br/>
Shortly, another trail (OAK RIDGE TRAIL) will come in on your left. <br/>
Turn here heading south. Continue along Oak Ridge and cross the Eagle <br/>
footbridge. Soon after, there will be a cutout in the boardwalk on <br/>
your right.  Turn right here onto FROG POND ROAD. (You'll soon see <br/>
signs confirming you are on the right track).<br/>
<br/>
When Frog Pond intersects with another large sand road (NORTH END <br/>
ROAD) turn left here and follow this road directly back to your car <br/>
and the nature center.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

WAIVER OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLAIMER<br/>
Letterboxing, like any outdoor sport, carries the risk of unforeseen <br/>
hazards. "Letterboxing North America" supports a policy of not <br/>
knowingly placing letterboxes in areas that will create undue risk to <br/>
the letterbox hunter. However, as conditions may vary, it is the <br/>
responsibility of the letterbox searcher to become thoroughly <br/>
familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to <br/>
adequately prepare for those conditions, and to conduct oneself <br/>
safely and responsibly with respect to those conditions and with <br/>
respect to his or her personal abilities and <br/>
limitations. "Letterboxing North America" and the individual <br/>
letterbox sponsors assume no liability for events which may occur <br/>
related directly or indirectly to one's searching for a letterbox. Do <br/>
not let children hunt for letterboxes unsupervised.<br/>
<br/>
By reading and utilizing the letterbox clues, you acknowledge the <br/>
above conditions, and accept responsibility for your own actions, and <br/>
agree to hold non-liable the clue writers and letterboxing <br/>
organizations and further, agree to provide this disclaimer to any <br/>
person with whom you share these letterbox clues.<br/>
