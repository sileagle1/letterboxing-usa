                    <div class="plaintext-content">Any boxers in the Southern Appalachian area October 12 are invited to join <br/>
up for the first annual Southern Highlands Clan Gathering, which this year <br/>
is piggybacked on our 10th Annual Roast at Higgins.  Higgins is about 40 <br/>
miles north of Asheville, 10 miles NW of Burnsville - it'll be on a good <br/>
map...follow the squiggles of the Cane River on Hwy 19W.  There will be <br/>
signs directing you to parking.<br/>
<br/>
If it rains, it's off....our deck is not covered and the house is tiny.  <br/>
However, we can still meet - somewhere in town.<br/>
<br/>
The meat is taken off the spit between 3 and 5pm, but you can come anytime.<br/>
<br/>
Bring a dish to pass (not pork), your own drinks, and something to sit on.<br/>
<br/>
It is also a good idea to wear head protection, as the black walnuts may <br/>
still be hurtling toward the deck.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some phone numbers for motels, B&amp;Bs, etc:<br/>
<br/>
Carolina Country Inn 828-682-6033<br/>
NuWray Inn 828-682-2329<br/>
Mountain View Motel 828-682-2115<br/>
Blue Ridge Motel 828-682-9100<br/>
Colonial Guest Rooms 828-682-2304<br/>
B&amp;Bs:<br/>
A Little Bit of Heaven 828-675-5379<br/>
Celo Inn 828-675-5132<br/>
Old Mine Fork Inn 828-682-7682<br/>
Terrell House 828-682-4505<br/>
<br/>
Mid-October is the height of the leaf color season here, so reserve early, <br/>
and don't plan on taking the Blue Ridge Parkway if you're in a hurry...you <br/>
can count on getting behind a few huge RVs who don't view the 45mph speed <br/>
limit as something to aim for... :)<br/>
<br/>
There are also campgrounds, but for some reason they aren't listed in our <br/>
phone book. Will track them down for anyone interested.<br/>
<br/>
See ya October 12!<br/>
