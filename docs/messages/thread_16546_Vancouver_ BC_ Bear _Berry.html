Hi, Thanks for your note on the above box. It was placed over 2 years ago while while on a visit to BC and the box is an oprhan.  I made a note on the clue sheet that it was reported not found and requested any previous boxer to area to let me know when it was last found.  I'll probably remove clues from list if I can't confirm that the box it still there.   The murals were interesting wern't they?.  I rechecked the clue sheet and if you went beyond the murals, crossing under the bridge and then down to the lower path leading to the footbridge,  as I recall the box was in a cleft in the embankment just to the left of a tree that was near the footbridge entrance.  I received a report in early spring that someone found the box but haven't heard anyting recent.   Sorry for the dry run, Gwen<br/>
<br/>
