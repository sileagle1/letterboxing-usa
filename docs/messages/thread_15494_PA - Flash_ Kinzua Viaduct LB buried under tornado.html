try again;  unfortunately, the original text was lost when posting <br/>
was denied . . . c'est la guerre . . . )<br/>
<br/>
The Kinzua Viaduct, located near the Allegheny National Forest in <br/>
northwestern Pennsylvania, was toppled in a direct hit by an unusual <br/>
tornado on July 21st.  Originally constructed in 1882 and then <br/>
rebuilt in 1900 to carry heavier trains of lumber and ore from the <br/>
region, the impressive structure had become a major tourist <br/>
attraction after freight use ended.  At 301 ft. in height, the 2,000-<br/>
ft. steel trestle was the highest in the whole world when built and <br/>
remained fourth highest to date.  An excursion train, the Knox and <br/>
Kane Railroad scheduled regular 96-mile round trips from Marienville, <br/>
PA, continuing to cross the bridge until last summer, when that <br/>
service was suspended pending repairs to strengthen it, especially <br/>
against high winds!  This work had already commenced when about half <br/>
of the trestle was toppled into the deep ravine last month by the <br/>
tornado.<br/>
<br/>
After I had discovered this excursion train several years ago, I did <br/>
indeed enjoy the trip to and over the Viaduct.  Returning to the <br/>
Kinzua Bridge State Park in May 2001 with fellow letterboxer, St. <br/>
George, we hid a box under a rocky outcrop well away from a paved <br/>
path.  Although the clues were never published here, for personal <br/>
reasons, the LB remained in place. <br/>
<br/>
Returning again last week to check its condition, with the intent of <br/>
publishing the clues at last, I found the State Park devastated but <br/>
remarkably still open to visitors via special marked paths to the <br/>
overlook.  About half the structure lies on the floor of the ravine, <br/>
blown completely clear of its footings.  A swath of trees on the <br/>
opposite side of the ravine upwind of the trestle lies completely <br/>
prostrate, as though felled by a giant scythe.  And the site of the <br/>
letterbox is buried several feet deep under fallen and splintered <br/>
trees!  The excursion train continues to run, though, and was <br/>
standing at the end of the Viaduct when I arrived at noon.  <br/>
(Information at www.knoxkanerr.com, or 814-927-6621.)  This would <br/>
make a memorable autumn outing.<br/>
<br/>
Whether the historic trestle will be rebuilt has not yet been <br/>
determined, although it is hardly less of a tourist attraction even <br/>
as it is.  When placed, the letterbox was envisioned as one uniquely <br/>
accessible by train;  now, if and when it is recovered or replaced, <br/>
it may remain unique in having gone through a tornado.  Stay <br/>
tuned . . .<br/>
