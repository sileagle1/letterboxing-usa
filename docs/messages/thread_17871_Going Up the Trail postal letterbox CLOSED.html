start out on the trail next month, is closed. There are 60-something <br/>
people already signed up, which is a already over my comfort zone. ;)<br/>
<br/>
This time, I think I am going to re-arrange the participants order <br/>
somewhat to group geographical areas together in hopes that the <br/>
letterbox makes the rounds a little quicker than it would otherwise. <br/>
<br/>
I think this is my favorite stamp that I have carved so far, so I am <br/>
being overprotective. LOL!<br/>
