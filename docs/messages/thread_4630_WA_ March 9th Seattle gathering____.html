Did I say March 3rd?  I don't see March 3rd in the title anywhere.  I <br/>
don't know what you're talking about....  =)<br/>

Must have been tired when I wrote that originally.  Yep, that's it.  <br/>
Must be it.<br/>

&gt; You've got us at the Red Robin in Tukwila Saturday evening at<br/>

<br/>
Tukwila?  Sheeze, I thought it was Seattle.  That's what the address <br/>
on Yahoo spits out.  You tell me it's Tukwila.  Another person tells <br/>
me, no, it's in SeaTac.  Does anyone here REALLY know what city this <br/>
place is in?  *rolling eyes*  =)<br/>

At the Letterboxing Summit, we can take a vote on the matter.  =)<br/>
