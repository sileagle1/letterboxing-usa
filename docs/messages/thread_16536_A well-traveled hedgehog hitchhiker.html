                    <div class="plaintext-content">My good friends JugglerMouse and Sir Balthazar sang the praises of <br/>
letterboxing to me for months. I agreed that it sounded like fun and <br/>
would be great exercise. They have kept me entertained with tales of <br/>
their own adventures, provided me with a delightful personal stamp, <br/>
log book, even a compass. I researched the nearest letterboxes to my <br/>
northern PA location, but time, alas, always seemed to short to <br/>
actually begin doing something about it.<br/>
<br/>
THEN JugglerMouse found a Wee Hedgehog hitchhiker (started by <br/>
Princess Turtle) while she was at the northern CA gathering in <br/>
September. Immediately, her generous mind leaped to the conclusion <br/>
that a hedgehog ought to be replanted by another hedgehog. Not only <br/>
that, she knew that if I was entrusted with a letterboxing <br/>
hitchhiker, then I would feel obligated to get out and go <br/>
letterboxing so that it might find a new resting place. So, she <br/>
mailed it to me, and that tiny beast took a giant leap across the <br/>
continent.<br/>
<br/>
I did indeed place it in its next temporary abode, leaving it in one <br/>
of the letterboxes hidden in Chemung County, New York, not terribly <br/>
far from my home, after a pleasant sunset hike. That was in late <br/>
September.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't had a chance to find another letterbox yet, but there are a <br/>
couple more not too far away. I hope to find at least one of them <br/>
before too much snow flies.<br/>
<br/>
JugglerMouse told me that I really ought to announce the adventure of <br/>
Wee Hedgehog here, so I have.<br/>
