<br/>
While at the Gateway Arch one year, we picked up a thing called <br/>
Passport to You National Parks. We're both into historical and <br/>
natural places, so we decided to check it out. Apparently, each year, <br/>
the National Park Service puts out little color stamps for every <br/>
region and sells them in a sheet of about 10. There's always a <br/>
picture of one of the NPS parks and a blurb under it about the park's <br/>
history or something). When you go to any national park, they'll let <br/>
you get a cancellation stamp to prove you've been there, like a <br/>
passport stamp (see our website to see what these looks like <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/dasprite222/passport.htm). You collect them <br/>
in the passport book just like we do with letterbox stamps, except <br/>
botht the booklet and the stamps are already made for you. The <br/>
passport book itself also comes with all sorts of info about the <br/>
parks and regions.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, it's not as personalized as letterboxing is, but <br/>
it's a fun way to see US parks and such. You can buy both stamps and <br/>
the little book (only about 6 inches by 3 inches) at any national <br/>
park or order them from www.eparks.com. Again, you don't have to do <br/>
this, but we figured this sort of interest crosses over into <br/>
letterboxing territory (especially since we plan our vacations around <br/>
national parks AND letterboxes now)!<br/>

We saw these Passports in a gift shop once and they bought me &amp; my brother each one because of all the places we were visiting there that had the passport stamps to collect.  I still have my book on my bookshelf, and a few months ago went to a NPS area where I saw they still had the passport stamp station, so of course I got a stamp to add to my book, as old as it is now!<br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>

While we're talking about N. Parks.  For those of you with children have you heard about the junior ranger program in National Parks and Sites.  Excellent program!!! It has kept  my kids interested through many an area.  Each park is different.  However, they have a basic "worksheet" they fill out through the area and then are sworn in and receive a patch/badge.  Ask about it next time you're at a National Park.<br/>
