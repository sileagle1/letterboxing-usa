my grandson, Chase, and later Music Woman.  It was my first time to <br/>
Northwest Park.  What a great place.  So much to see and do and <br/>
find!! WE'll have to return to get more of the boxes.  Our pace was <br/>
slow due to 2 strollers, but it was a beautiful, windy day. We had <br/>
lots of fun. We found some birds, herbs, a turtle, and even the sun <br/>
and the moon!!  Can't wait to go back!!!- Sunshine :0)<br/>
