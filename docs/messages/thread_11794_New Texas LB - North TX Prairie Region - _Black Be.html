Texas History Letterbox Series<br/>
<br/>
The "Black Beans" letterbox is located in Monument Hill State <br/>
Historical Park.  The park commemorates the dead Texas patriots from <br/>
the Mier Expedition, who were executed in Mexico.  After invading <br/>
Mexico to retaliate for Mexican invasions of the Republic of Texas, <br/>
the 308 Texas of the expedition surrendered to Mexican forces.  <br/>
During their march to Mexico City, 188 escaped but could not find <br/>
enough food or water to survive.  176 of the men were recaptured, 7 <br/>
died, and 5 reached Texas.   Of these 176, Santa Anna ordered 1/10 of <br/>
them to be executed.   This was done by placing 159 white beans and <br/>
17 black beans in a pot.  Those who drew black beans were executed.   <br/>
One of the surviving "white bean" men, upon his release from the <br/>
Mexican prison a year later, gathered the bones of the executed <br/>
Texans and had them brought back to Texas.  This site contains the <br/>
bones of these brave men.  Also on the site is the Kreische Brewery <br/>
State Historical Park.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

To the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Get map at entrance station.  Go ahead and walk around the historic <br/>
loop, seeing the monument, home and brewery, then return to the <br/>
entrance deck.  Follow the Nature Trail starting from the deck and <br/>
heading north into the woods below.  At the "Trailhead", go right and <br/>
continue to the #2 post on your right.  Locate the large leaning tree <br/>
on your right at 160 degrees.  The box is at the base of this tree on <br/>
the back right side, in a hole in the tree's base, covered with <br/>
leaves and a stone.<br/>
