Now.... if LBNA can get the ones that I've already found to "hide" like they do on atlasquest.... (hint hint.... ;-)<br/>

Thanks for the great addition to the website!  Now I need to get wireless broadband so I can update my logbook at school, at rehearsal, ..... who needs time to work when there's so much letterboxing work to be done!!!!<br/>

I have so many finds that are NOT in LbNA or AQ that I'll never get a <br/>
true virtual log.  All those Jay Drew boxes that have gone missing <br/>
(Harbor of Refuge just to name one), all of Trish's boxes, all of the <br/>
MMM boxes ....  I deliberately entered my retired boxes in AQ so that <br/>
folks could record them as a find.  And two boxes I recently retired <br/>
in LbNA are still in there (although marked as retired) so that folks <br/>
can still record them as a find.<br/>
<br/>

My sentiments exactly.  I feverishly added my "finds" last night (not all F-149 are there).  I <br/>
will maintain my AQ statuses as well.  I put my missing boxes in for others, hoping they <br/>
will return the favor.  I really do appreciate Ryan's "hiding found boxes" function, one of <br/>
the very best features of AQ.<br/>

Doesn't this feature then rather hurt the idea of getting the missing or <br/>
purposefully retired boxes out of the database so that things aren't so clogged up?<br/>

Sorry!  I should have stated ... I put my missing boxes in Atlas Quest for others to count.  I <br/>
don't plan to add them back into LBNA.<br/>
