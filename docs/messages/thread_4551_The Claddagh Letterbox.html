 <em>The Claddagh Letterbox</em></strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div><em> A single letterbox placed on <strong>2-23-02</strong>  by 
the <strong>Gal Pals </strong>at the <strong>Pine Knob Loop Trail </strong>in 
<strong>Cornwall, CT </strong>in honor of our mothers. God Bless Them 
!</em></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>The <strong>Claddagh </strong>is an <strong>Irish symbol </strong>worn 
by people all over the world as a <strong>Universal token </strong>of 
<strong>love, friendship</strong>, </em><em><strong>loyalty and 
fidelty</strong>. We offer it to you in the form of a letterbox. </em></div>
<div> </div>
<div><em><strong>Difficulty</strong>- it's not easy but it's worth it. 
<strong>The 50 Hikes in CT </strong>list it as <strong>AB </strong>which means 
it is between difficult and tough.  <strong>However, we old gals made it 
just fine !!</strong>  ( Two of us are over 50 and we just started in 
September)  We made it in <strong>2 1/2 hrs. </strong>Bring water and 
snacks ! Approx. <strong>2. 8 miles </strong>to the loop trip.</em></div>
<div> </div>
<div><em><strong>Directions</strong>- From <strong>CT-4 junction with US-7 in 
Cornwall</strong>, take <strong>US-7 north </strong>for <strong>1 mile 
</strong>and <strong>notice </strong>the oval blue sign for the <strong>Pine 
Knob Loop Trail </strong>at the parking area on the left. ( If you go past 
the Housatonic Meadows Campground on your right, you  have gone too 
far.)</em></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div><em><strong>The Hike to the Letterbox- </strong>Take the <strong>blue 
blazed trail </strong>at the norteast end of the parking area. Walk along 
<strong>Hatch Brook </strong>past an old cellar hole, bearing to your right to 
cross the brook. Trail passes through a break in a stone wall. At the junction 
of the trail, turn right and take the blue trail . At 0.2 mile, the Pine Knob 
Loop officially starts. Here at the intersection, continue straight  
through the pine and hemlock forest <strong>heading north and parallel to US-7 
and the Housatonic Meadows Campground </strong>. Four tenths of a mile from the 
start of the Loop, the <strong>trail heads left at the double blazing and begins 
its climb to the summit of Pine Knob</strong>. It is a moderately steep ascent 
but there are places to stop and catch your breath along the way. ( a miniature 
waterfall is one of them) The climb becomes more rocky and rooty as you make 
your way up. At one mile, the trail opens to a place of rest with a lovely 
vista. ( You are not far from the letterbox but take a break and have a snack 
here) Continue following the blue blazes through a thicket of mountain laurel - 
you will come to a little drop down but it is not that difficult if you 
<strong>take it slowly and help one another</strong>. Younger folks will laugh 
when they see it but I caution those of respectable years like myself to "easy 
does it". Once down follow the path along a flatter trail. Shortly you will come 
upon a tree marking the <strong>junction </strong>of the <strong>Appalachian 
Trail with the Pine Knob Loop. </strong></em><em>. <strong>Stand facing the tree 
</strong>marking the junction of the trail and <strong>bearing 330 
degrees ,</strong> go up </em><em><strong>17 paces ( 34 steps) 
</strong>along the <strong>blue/white trail </strong>to a solitary boulder next 
to an evergreen tree. <strong>The Claddagh Letterbox </strong>is located at the 
base of the tree under a trap door. Good for you ! Stamp in and when done, 
continue on the blue/white trail. The <strong>AT </strong>and <strong>Pine Knob 
Loop </strong>run together for <strong>3/4 mile</strong>. After <strong>0.4 
mile</strong>, you will come to another beautiful outlook. You can see Mohawk 
Mountain off to your left from here. The beautiful Housatonic River is seen as 
it runs down to Cornwall Bridge. Go down along the trail</em></div>
<div><em>southwest  as it descends to a branch in the trail where the 
Appalachian Trail leaves the Pine Knob Loop. <strong>Stay with the Loop Trail 
</strong>( blue blazes) as it travels along with <strong>Hatch 
Brook</strong>.  The trail descends through the ravine. In another 0.5 
miles, you will reach the loop junction and stone wall that you encountered on 
the way in. Turn right through the break in the wall and on back to the  
parking area. We hope you enjoyed the hike !</em></div>

<div><strong>PS. </strong>If you should see a turkey vulture or 
hawk flying over, know that <strong>Oma </strong>from <strong>"Oma's Outlook 
</strong>", another letterbox in Durham, is watching over you. She was born in 
Cornwall Bridge just down the road a' piece. She is one of the mothers we honor 
here as well as Clare and Florence. ( <a href="mailto:Simon.nuhn@snet.net">Simon.nuhn@snet.net</a>)</div></body></html>
