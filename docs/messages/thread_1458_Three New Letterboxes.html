<br/>
These letterboxes are hidden in one of our favorite hiking trails behind Lake Compounce located on the Bristol/Southington town line.<br/>
The first two letterboxes are fairly easy to find. The trail is moderately difficult only due to the climbing over roots and rocks in the trail. Total hiking time one way is approx. 1 hour depending on how much time you spend viewing the bountiful scenery. <br/>

Sorry about the inconvenience of my infected message dated 11/4/00. I have cleared up the problem and am posting "healthy" clues below. Thank you for your patience.<br/>
