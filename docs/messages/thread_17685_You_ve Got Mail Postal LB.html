My son is excited by the response and except for the name confusion, will <br/>
send it out as soon as he gathers 50 names. He's about half way there.<br/>

Retyping your address doesn't help.  Anytime someone types anything <br/>
that looks like an email address, Yahoo disguises it by chopping it <br/>
off.  This is to protect you from having your email snatched by <br/>
automated programs that search the internet looking for addresses <br/>
for spam lists.<br/>
<br/>
You need to type something like this:<br/>
<br/>
"My address is szorzi_1999 (and then you readers should type the <br/>
symbol for "at") yahoo (and then type a period) com."<br/>
<br/>
Since we were able to see Rturtle99@a, you can for now just let us <br/>
know what comes after the "at" symbol and we'll be able to put it <br/>
all together!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

    Thanks for the info. Fortunately a lot of you yahoo users know the ropes <br/>
and have been able to send my son their addresses. I'll keep this in mind for <br/>
the future. <br/>
    So the address to request the "It's in the Mail" Postal LB (see previous <br/>
posting about name change) should read: <br/>
<br/>
Rturtle99 (and then you readers should type the symbol for "at") aol (and <br/>
then type a period) com<br/>
