<br/>
Folks - I just got a report that Great Blue Heron of the Laudholm <br/>
Quest as well as Nautilus' Otter in the Pines was left out in the <br/>
open.<br/>
<br/>
Saco Heath #2 was graciously replaced by Giddy a few months ago in a <br/>
new hiding spot. It should NOT BE MOVED to the original location due <br/>
to the sensitivity of the wildlife in that location. My clues have <br/>
been updated to reflect this and it should have never been relocated.<br/>
<br/>
*****PLEASE DO NOT MOVE A BOX FROM WHERE YOU FOUND IT UNLESS YOU <br/>
NOTIFY THE PLACER.*****<br/>
<br/>
I don't in any way shape or form appreciate this as I also live a <br/>
good 3.5 hours north of this location and would not like to get in <br/>
trouble with the powers that be in that area.<br/>
<br/>
This is a warning - if my boxes are left out in the open to be <br/>
destroyed, they will ALL go away. They will be pulled until further <br/>
notice or until you can figure out how to take care of the product.<br/>

you that Johnny LB) &amp; you should perhaps use some better manners on <br/>
this board.<br/>
<br/>
We should ALL care when LBs get removed &amp; are being neglected as so <br/>
many of them are lately.  A few weeks ago my children &amp; I found 3 <br/>
out of 3 letterboxes in one day out in the open with no attempt at <br/>
all made to conceal them.  If that remains the trend, letterboxing <br/>
as we know it will surely die &amp; those that have worked long &amp; hard <br/>
to carve &amp; place will no longer work to do so.  <br/>
<br/>
Why would anyone spend time &amp; energy for others who so obviously do <br/>
not appreciate it.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tend to each &amp; every box as <br/>
if it were your own.  If you do not, then there will be no boxes <br/>
left to find.  <br/>
<br/>
As for you Johnny- your attitude is precisely what may be wrong with <br/>
letterboxing today.  I care about letterboxing everywhere because I <br/>
like to box outside of my backyard &amp; when I take a trip to Maine or <br/>
to wherever you are &amp; I would HOPE that all the boxes are in <br/>
terrific shape when I get there.  How would you like it if someone <br/>
destroyed the boxes that you so carefully planned &amp; planted?  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are some good points being made here, but I would second the thought others have had..... I think we should be careful before being so quick to assume that most of the poor re-hidings are being committed by letterboxers, and especially letterboxers who are taking the time to read the hundreds of posts here every day.  Yes, I'm sure it happens.   But I have to highly disagree with the assumptions that are being made about the percentages... I can easily imagine that 2/3 of the 'bad re-hidings by letterboxers" are actually caused by an animal, a natural phenomenon like wind, torrential rains, moving earth, etc. etc.  As letterboxers who supposedly get outdoors, we certainly ought to be as savvy as anyone about how much change occurs out there, even overnight.  I've observed a small creek near my parents' house that rarely moves much water.  The rocks change positions drastically, all the time, until my favorite spots are unrecognizable.  Animals move one end of a rotting log, and the other end was hiding a letterbox.... we see no bite marks and assume a letterboxer did it. And In parks, we have to expect that the rangers are going to periodically clear dead logs too and anything could happen to the letterbox that happens to be under one.  Large items in my yard have made their way to a neighboring yard due to bad storms, even when I thought I had them anchored.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, there may be people here who re-hide poorly.  Could we just continue to remind people &amp; give positive suggestions rather than sounding ugly with the blame when we really don't know where it should be placed?  Someday we may have to get a just a little more honest with the fact that we're placing thousands of unnatural objects in a natural environment and that it is next to impossible to keep ALL of that stuff from ever becoming litter.  I love it as much as the next person (letterboxing) but as I've said before, with the high percentage of boxes I've found with bite marks and punctures, I'm no longer under romantic notions about how innocent and good for the environment it is. It has its hazards, and that's all there is to it.  I found one a few weeks ago that was flung open around the hiding spot, the stamp chewed in half.  The box had bite marks all over it and was punctured.  I'm sure PA isn't unique in this respect.  Many of you have mentioned how your dogs sniff out boxes.  Wild animals aren't any different!!  Yes, letterboxing gets me out there.  Not that I wouldn't be out there anyway.  But I'm sure we're all different in that way, too.  I'm sure many people have started hiking due to this hobby.  What percentage of boxes that are damaged, out in the open, or lost can honestly be blamed on letterboxers?  We really don't know.  So in our anger and frustration, let's not assume we do.   My hubby likes to say that ASSuming makes an ass of you and me!  Good advice he got from a teacher once.  I'll spare you the story!  --lunaryakketyact  <br/>
