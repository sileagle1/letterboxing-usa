&gt; &gt;It is not an original drawing because I can't free hand <br/>
&gt; &gt;anything but stick figures (&amp; even those are questionable), <br/>
&gt; &gt;so I hope it doesn't violate a copy write. I'm sure if it <br/>
&gt; &gt;does, someone on the list will let me know and I will pull it. <br/>
<br/>
I'll preface this by saying I'm not a lawyer, but i do know a few <br/>
good lawyer jokes......<br/>
<br/>
I know everyone has their 2 cents and if we put them together we'll <br/>
be rich! LOL But here's my take on this. A copyright is designed to <br/>
keep one person from making money off someone else's logo,words,etc. <br/>
(in the same way a patent works).  So.... unless you're somehow <br/>
making money off a stamp that you put in a box out in the middle of <br/>
the woods, I would not worry about it. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, I would suggest asking permission to use an image if you <br/>
know the original author; but thats the difference beytween <br/>
legalities and morals! By the way... I can barely draw a stick figure <br/>
myself! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you are using clip art as a starting point (not copyrighted<br/>
characters), you shouldn't need to worry about copyright, since clip<br/>
art is usually sold as royalty-free images that can be published<br/>
however the purchaser sees fit.<br/>
<br/>
In art there is no definite line to tell you how much copying is okay<br/>
and how much is plagiarism, so its just your own judgement on how<br/>
purely original you want it to be. Its up to you how you will combine<br/>
the ingredients to make your own creation. As Wild Woman says, you<br/>
wouldn't want the artist of the original clip art to recognize your<br/>
stamp as a simple copy. If its going to be in the collections of the<br/>
Smithsonian, it should be worth the effort to make it your own image,<br/>
whether you start with clip art or draw it from scratch. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, even if you can't draw a stick person there are<br/>
plenty of stamp designs you could make that don't depend on drawing<br/>
realistically!<br/>
