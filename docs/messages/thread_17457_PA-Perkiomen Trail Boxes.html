                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
I just got back from upgrading all six stamps for my Perkiomen trail series.<br/>
I was a little sheepish about the quality and size of the store bought<br/>
original stamps.<br/>
So, over the holidays, I ordered some carving material and tools and got to<br/>
work.<br/>
Six brand new, hand carved stamps await you.<br/>
<br/>
Just in case you have looked and not found, all six are still in place and<br/>
in good health.<br/>
Also, I managed to access all 6 in less than 2 hours including drive time<br/>
between them.<br/>
This is not meant as a challenge or anything, (after all, I did not have to<br/>
hunt too hard for them).<br/>
But if anyone manages to beat 1 hour and 45 minutes for all six, let me<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and let me know if you find any.<br/>
