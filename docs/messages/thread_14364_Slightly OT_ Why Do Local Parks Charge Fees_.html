Why do local parks charge entrance fees for people who don't have tags<br/>
on their cars from the areas that the parks are in? I first<br/>
experienced this in the Fredericksburg, VA, area, and I saw a post<br/>
recently about a Fairfax, VA, park that does the same thing. I mean,<br/>
these are LOCAL parks. State and national parks, I can understand. I<br/>
just don't get it. <br/>

didn't seem fair for non-residents to get to use our two main parks <br/>

city, the folks using our pay for use parks are generally going <br/>
fishing and typically are not contributing to the local economy by <br/>
shopping, dining, etc.<br/>

county taxes.  If a city or county feels that persons are not paying for the<br/>
upkeep of the park (i.e. people from outside the city or county) but are taking<br/>
advantage of what the park has to offer, they may charge a fee to non-residents<br/>
to offset that usage.<br/>
<br/>
This is very similar to what many state and community colleges do.  They charge<br/>
a higher tuition to students from out of state as they have not put any money<br/>
(by way of taxes) into the institution but are taking advantage of the<br/>
educational opportunities afforded by the college.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here in Washington state we are having quite a hard time finding <br/>
funding for parks.  Not only State Parks but many King County ( <br/>
seattle metro area) parks.<br/>
<br/>
Most are using a parking fee.  A few parks are covered by the <br/>
municipality they are in .  <br/>
<br/>
Ft Worden in Pt Townsend is a state park and the city certainly <br/>
recognizes the importance of this park as a destination.  They cover <br/>
the parking fee and this allows visitors to consider spending their <br/>
money in town etc.  Certainly made me feel like the city understood <br/>
the worth of this big destination park inside their city limits.<br/>
<br/>
I think many communities are finding the need to charge a nominal fee <br/>
to cover the basic upkeep of the parks.  I have to wonder however <br/>
what the cost of the implementation of the fee and collections etc <br/>
are and if they are offset by the fee.<br/>

funded park.  The township set up the park with the provision that the town's <br/>
people will pay for the upkeep of the park and all those outside the cty limits <br/>
will pay a voluntary $1 fee.  Its a nice idea .  <br/>
