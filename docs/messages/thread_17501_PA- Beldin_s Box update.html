resubmit might be in order for those eager boxer's heading out into <br/>
the chill this weekend.<br/>

Beldin stirred from his dream and sat upright. He then awoke from<br/>
that dream and sat bolt upright. After which he shook himself into<br/>
consciousness once moreand simply refused to sit upright again.<br/>
<br/>
"Waking and dreaming seem to have merged into a single phenomenon of<br/>
late," reflected Beldin; "so much so that I may have slept unawares<br/>
for several months. Perhaps it is time to explore new realms."<br/>
<br/>
Shaking the desire to contemplate further if he indeed was awake,<br/>
Beldin set off down the trail. He made absolutely no notes of<br/>
reference either to bridge, birch or brook. If he was simply<br/>
dreaming again, what good would it do to count paces or estimate<br/>
random bearings?<br/>
<br/>
"Well, my pants look no worse for the wear, but my awareness is due<br/>
to be patched with a new outlook on existence," Beldin declared. "I<br/>
will travel in abstract leaps for a time."<br/>
<br/>
Beldin approached a rock wall along the trail. With particular<br/>
attention to being random, he hopped over the wall, slalomed around<br/>
several cubby-holed trees and then initiated an arbitrary teleport<br/>
losing himself, well, quite entirely.<br/>
<br/>
"Hmm, that's strange: I have the sudden desire to eat oatmeal and to<br/>
knit in eastern Pennsylvania."<br/>
<br/>
Directly downhill from that desire, Beldin contemplated crossing a<br/>
stream upon a log. Unfortunately he tripped on his own ingenuity<br/>
and found his foot had gotten stuck beneath the adjacent boulder.<br/>
<br/>
"Forget it! I'm not resting this time; I'll just wait for someone to<br/>
happen by and give me an assist."<br/>
