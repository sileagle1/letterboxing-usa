<p><strong>hey all, i was 'boxing with my mom (wandering frog) this morning, we went to the Thank You letterbox in Mansfield off of Bone Mill Road.... what was that place? with all the town names on the building. it all looked pretty deserted to us, were all these buildings down here (and further down the hill) once part of Mansfield Training School, or have they always been part of Uconn? thanks for help if anyone knows the answer.... just curious...!! </strong></p>
