<br/>
I'm currently writing an article about Letterboxing for a GenX women's<br/>
magazine, and I would love to talk to any women in their 20s-late 30s<br/>
who letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
If you have the time, please send you answers to these questions to me<br/>
at bonnie@grrl.com.<br/>
<br/>
I think Letterboxing would interest women aged 18-35 (our readership)<br/>
and would love to get quotes from those of you who love this<br/>
interesting  hobby/artform.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time. ;-)<br/>

2. Why and how did you start becoming involved in letterboxing?<br/>
3. Why are you interested in letterboxing as a hobby?<br/>
4. Is letterboxing more of an artistic expression or a fun hiking<br/>
adventure?<br/>
5. Do you usually go letterboxing by yourself or with a group of friends?<br/>
6. What do kind of stamp/art do you leave in the box?<br/>
7. What's the most unusual item/stamp you've found in a letterbox?<br/>
8. Why do you think letterboxing is growing in popularity?<br/>
9. Do you see more women than men interested in letterboxing or is it<br/>
fairly even with the genders in participation?<br/>
10. Any key tips for those wanting to become involved in letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
thanks again! ;-)<br/>
