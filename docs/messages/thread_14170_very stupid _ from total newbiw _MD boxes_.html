South Mountain Trinity #1 and Washington Monument to be MIA.<br/>
<br/>
As for the High Knob box at Gambrill State Park, it's also MIA, but <br/>
we have some inside info. A good friend is a ranger there. I ran the <br/>
letterboxing thing by him, thinking I would plant some more boxes <br/>
there. Because of the proximity of the Catoctin parks to Ft. Detrick, <br/>
the parks have been combed by the FBI in search of anthrax evidence. <br/>
He was unaware of the ADG box, but suspects any "suspicious" material <br/>
has been removed by the FBI. On the bright side, he will let me (us?) <br/>
place boxes with his approval. <br/>
