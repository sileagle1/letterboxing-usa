Happiness and Light the way today.  We were successful finding both! <br/>
<br/>
Both boxes were found intact and dry - and I just missed another boxer <br/>
on Double Happiness.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to Butterfly for Light The Way and to Aili, Bruce and Erin <br/>
for Double Happiness.<br/>
<br/>
I was very impressed with the amount of work that was done over near<br/>
Community Lake in Wallingford and I am planning on returning in the <br/>
spring for bike riding / picnicing with the family.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to you and yours during the new year.<br/>
Until later.<br/>
