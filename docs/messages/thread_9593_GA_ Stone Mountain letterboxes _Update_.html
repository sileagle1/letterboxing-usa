                    <div class="plaintext-content">     First time posting to the letterboxing group!  My wife and I are <br/>
new to the hobby, and went on our second outing yesterday.  I wanted <br/>
to take a moment to give you an update on the boxes we found.<br/>
     We were able to locate two of the four letterboxes at Atlanta's <br/>
Stone Mountain Park yesterday.  Both "Strength" and "Eagle's Nest" <br/>
are in perfect condition.  If you go after them, be ready for a <br/>
hike!  Unfortunately, the other two boxes hidden in the park had very <br/>
vague and cryptic clues, which kept us from leaving with all four <br/>
stamps.<br/>
     This was a particularly fun outing for the two of us as it <br/>
allowed us to relive our first date, in which we climbed the <br/>
mountain.  I just wish I had been in as good a shape yesterday as I <br/>
was three and half years ago!<br/>

<br/>
I can't vouch for the other letterbox since I haven't been around to <br/>
look for it since it was placed, but I can assure you that my <br/>
letterbox clues aren't as vague as they may appear at first reading.  <br/>
There might be hundreds of trees with scars at Stone Mountain, but <br/>
it's distinctive enough where it's pretty obvious when you see it.  <br/>
The infamous "you'll know it when you see it" type of clue.  The kind <br/>
where letterboxers are likely to see it and think, "Oh, that's SOOO <br/>
got to be it!  I *KNOW* that's the tree!"  And every little detail <br/>
mentioned in the clue suddenly falls into place.<br/>
<br/>
So I hope you don't give up too easily!  I've gotten e-mails from <br/>
several people saying they've found the letterbox, with reports that <br/>
even more people have found it who haven't e-mail me.  As vague as <br/>
the clues may seem, the box really is findable!  =)  <br/>
<br/>
In fact, from the sounds of it, it might actually be one of my most <br/>
visited boxes I've ever placed!  =)  Which probably isn't a big shock <br/>
to most people hunting down my boxes if you realize that most of the <br/>
letterboxes I've placed are in locations so remote (Central America, <br/>
Africa) or the hikes are so difficult (the Stone Mountain hike really <br/>
is one of my easy hikes), or the clues intentionally so cryptic (many <br/>
of my mystery boxes) that the boxes are lucky to get more than one or <br/>
two letterboxers a year finding them!<br/>
<br/>
In any case, sometimes it takes several tries to finally nab a <br/>
letterbox, and that's part of the game, I suppose.  *shrug*  Although <br/>
I do have to admit, I'm getting really sick of going out and hunting <br/>
down Funhog's Hidden Dragon letterbox without success!  (Don't worry, <br/>
that's in Oregon, so you're safe there in Georgia!  *smile*)<br/>
