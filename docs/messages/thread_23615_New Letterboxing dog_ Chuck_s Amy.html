Almost all our letterboxing friends know of the loss of our dog and family<br/>
member Molly a month and a half ago to cancer. I used to say that Molly was<br/>
the brains of our letterboxing partnership. Well, I was wrong. She was the<br/>
heart. With her gone, we were broken. We decided that we had to start all<br/>
over again, raise a puppy, and have another dog in our lives. She won't<br/>
replace Molly and can't fill her shoes but she will be "her own person". She<br/>
is a 9 week old Chocolate Lab named Amy. We got her on the 21st and on the<br/>
22nd at 8 weeks old, she was at her first letterbox Chick in a Nest in<br/>
Mansfield CT. Since then she has been to 4 more boxes (F5). To see pictures<br/>
of Amy just go to the following link:<br/>

<br/>
  i have never been to fond about owning a dog, but who knows. maybe team new hampshire could become a team of 6.<br/>
