have warned you for the past month or so of our arrival and for you <br/>
not to be prepared would be your fault, not ours.  run if you wish, <br/>
but do remember, we will find you. we will be coming in force. mr <br/>
brown, i hope you are ready. you seem to be the weaker of the bunch. <br/>
as noble as you may sound to your fellow keystone staters, you will <br/>
recieve the worst of our fury. don't take our threat lightly mr brown. <br/>
you have angered the wrong beings. you will have to find out for your <br/>
self.<br/>
