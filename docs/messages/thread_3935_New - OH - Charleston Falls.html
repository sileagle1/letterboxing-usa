Difficulty: 1.5 (one mile of park trails with specific directions)<br/>
Near West Charleston, Miami County, Ohio<br/>

This box is placed in the prettiest part of a very pretty park.  A 30-<br/>
foot waterfall cascades to the base of a huge sycamore tree only feet <br/>
from the hiding spot.  Take your camera.<br/>
<br/>
Beginning on I 70 on the north side of Dayton, take the State Route <br/>
202 exit north at Huber Heights.  Pass through Phoneton and cross US <br/>
40.  The next major intersection is Ross Road.  Take Ross west for a <br/>
mile and the parking area is on the north side of the road.  <br/>
<br/>
Only one trail begins at the parking area.  Walk a few paces into the <br/>
woods and take the path that heads off at 40 degrees.  After 45 paces <br/>
(1 pace = 2 steps, or about 5 feet) the trail splits.  Take the right <br/>
fork toward the falls.  It is about a quarter of a mile to the <br/>
falls.  <br/>
<br/>
Arriving at the falls overlook, note the wood steps just past the <br/>
sycamore tree in the chasm.  Your goal is the top of those wood <br/>
steps.  The easiest way to get there is to go back the way you came <br/>
23 paces to a path heading over the edge of the cliff.  It is a lot <br/>
safer than it looks!  Take the stairs down, take a picture, and then <br/>
climb the stairs on the other side.  <br/>
