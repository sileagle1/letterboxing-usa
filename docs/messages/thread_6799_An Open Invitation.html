To no one in particular... seems this bit o' wheat has been lost <br/>
amongst the sea of chaff.  Are Pilgrims welcome at this pow-wow?  <br/>
Pumpkin cookies, perhaps?<br/>

<div>Those who quest for the star-crossed steed shall find my people gathered at a sanctuary from the neighboring tribes embroiled in King Philip's war.  I offer you peace here at the shores of the fresh water named for me as leader of the Eastern Niantics.  Even the white man now acknowledges my presence over this land, though initially he named the water for the same English king for whom he named the town.  I ask only that you come willing to share in the fruits of your your kitchen and of your carving.  Together we will begin new pursuits...</div>
