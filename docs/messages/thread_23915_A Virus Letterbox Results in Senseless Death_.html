I like a good challenge and I'm in it for the kill.<br/>

HOWEVER,<br/>
<br/>
I have just discovered a "Virus" letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The way I understand it is this:<br/>
<br/>
Someone puts a Virus Letterbox in the hiding place of your letterbox.<br/>
It contains clues to where your original letterbox has been rehidden <br/>
somewhere else nearby.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My friend's letterbox was hit by the Virus and moved to a new <br/>
location, just around the corner, to a spot where local NON-boxers <br/>
easily found it, opened it, strewed the contents about and left it at <br/>
the mercy of the weather.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, <br/>
<br/>
But I'm saying it,<br/>
<br/>
My friend was not happy to find his letterbox strewn about with a <br/>
soggy logbook and a weathered and cracked stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I was not happy to hear about it either. So I consulted with some <br/>
other boxers before going absolutely ape (poo) here.<br/>
<br/>
The placement of a letterbox is sacred.<br/>
<br/>
Forget the "There is no rules" rule to letterboxing.<br/>
(And add all caps and exclamation point for emphasis.)<br/>
<br/>
YOU DON'T REHIDE SOMEONE ELSE'S LETTERBOX IN A NEW LOCATION!<br/>
<br/>
(I'm not talking about a letterbox in it's original hiding place that <br/>
faces imminent destruction - that's a different topic.)<br/>
<br/>
I admire the innovation of the creation of a Virus Letterbox and <br/>
though, to quote a friend, "It seemed like a fun idea at the time."<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't. <br/>
<br/>
It resulted in the senseless dismemberment of a letterbox.<br/>

Her Ladyship most emphatically concurs. Such an act and even such an<br/>
idea reveals an unbridled confidence and a presumptuousness which is<br/>
unacceptable in polite society. Letterboxers consider their creation<br/>
including it's hiding spot to be a creative if not artistic expression<br/>
and one simply doesn't tamper with it. Period. The end.<br/>
<br/>
You're too generous Ivy dear to reward this activity with praise for<br/>
it's creativity. It should never have been considered. If, as should<br/>
be the case, you have respect for someone elses property and creative<br/>
expression then it should have been an inconcievable idea. If one<br/>
selects a bad hiding spot for ones own box and it is destroyed then<br/>
one learns a lesson. If ones box is attacked by a virus and destroyed<br/>
as a result then one is righteously pissed. If her Ladyship may be<br/>
excused for stooping (er um curtseying) to using the vernacular.<br/>

Thank you for your support and welcome home from rehab.<br/>

Perhaps you're right in saying I was too lenient, but I was trying NOT <br/>

I hope you're well rested for the weekend.<br/>

Those of you new to this list should feel most graced as these are two of this talk lists most beloved people from years gone by. <br/>
Welcome back, LP -we've heard your rehab was difficult since you were not surrounded in the lap of luxury of which you deserve and expect. And we hated to see your downfall that was documented for all the world to see on our website. Sue &amp; I are glad that better days are ahead. PI - thank you for bringing this controversial idea to the forefront on this list. We can always count on a frank discussion from you.<br/>
Speaking to the issue at hand - there is a basic issue that we discuss frequently on the Newboxers talk list:<br/>
NEVER MOVE ANOTHER PLACERS BOX UNLESS YOU RECEIVE PERMISSION!<br/>
This is a poor idea and one that we hope dies a quick death. As an added idea that came up in a discussion with others - it might be a nice twist for the placer of the box to do this to their own box. Then this idea may work. And only then!<br/>

&gt; Her Ladyship most emphatically concurs. Such an act and even such an<br/>
&gt; idea reveals an unbridled confidence and a presumptuousness which is<br/>
&gt; unacceptable in polite society. Letterboxers consider their creation<br/>
&gt; including it's hiding spot to be a creative if not artistic <br/>
expression<br/>
&gt; and one simply doesn't tamper with it. Period. The end.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You're too generous Ivy dear to reward this activity with praise for<br/>
&gt; it's creativity. It should never have been considered. If, as should<br/>
&gt; be the case, you have respect for someone elses property and <br/>
creative<br/>
&gt; expression then it should have been an inconcievable idea. If one<br/>
&gt; selects a bad hiding spot for ones own box and it is destroyed then<br/>
&gt; one learns a lesson. If ones box is attacked by a virus and <br/>
destroyed<br/>
&gt; as a result then one is righteously pissed. If her Ladyship may be<br/>

WOW!  Interesting concept and it does seem like a fun idea.... *IF* <br/>
they had permission from the original placer and the original placer <br/>
agreed with the new location, etc.  To just move it with no <br/>
permission/approval of new location is absolutely horrible!  That <br/>
takes an amazing amount of disrespect.  I'd be furious!  Did your <br/>
friend contact the virus-placer, how'd that go?  Or were they cowards <br/>
that left no contact info?<br/>

  No!  No, no, no.  How wrong.<br/>
<br/>
  On the other hand--break into a parked car, rifle through someone's personal belongings, and abscond with a legendary letterbox?  As the witch said:<br/>

The way I understand it is this:<br/>
<br/>
Someone puts a Virus Letterbox in the hiding place of your letterbox.<br/>
It contains clues to where your original letterbox has been rehidden <br/>
somewhere else nearby.<br/>

&gt; YOU DON'T REHIDE SOMEONE ELSE'S LETTERBOX IN A NEW LOCATION!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (I'm not talking about a letterbox in it's original hiding place <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; faces imminent destruction - that's a different topic.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
We recently received a note from a Finder of one of our Oregon <br/>
Letterboxes, Fogarty's Flower. The location that we had picked for the <br/>
hide was a knarly tree. They found that the tree was labeled for <br/>
removal. They placed the letterbox in a nearby hiding spot, sent us <br/>
the clues and a photo of the location,(how do they put those little <br/>
cameras in cell phones?). <br/>
This is the imminent destruction that is another topic that PI <br/>
mentions. This is a case of a great move on the part of a finder.<br/>
