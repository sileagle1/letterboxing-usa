Gulf Branch is one of many creeks that form creek valleys draining <br/>
into the Potomac River.  Several are small parks.  Normally Gulf <br/>
Branch is a cool and pleasant tree shaded oasis on hot days.  With <br/>
the recent drought, we found the path dusty for the first time we <br/>
remember.  Still it's a shady pleasant walk along the creek ending in <br/>
views of the river, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Through here passes the Potomac Heritage Trail.  A very long <br/>
riverside trail from Teddy Roosevelt Island all the way to the <br/>
beltway, I495.  You can find a map of it at Teddy Roosevelt Island <br/>
(and a couple nice letterboxes there too) but you won't need the map <br/>
to find the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
In North Arlington, off Military Road find 36th Road near Gulf Branch <br/>
Nature Center.  Don't be fooled by 36th Street right next door.  Park <br/>
at the curb opposite Nelson Street.  Wood steps take you down to the <br/>
path.  Head towards the river.  You'll cross the creek a couple times <br/>
and go under the George Washington Parkway crossing very high <br/>
overhead.  In the second crossing, we discovered a teetering rock <br/>
slab that banged with a loud satisfying thwack echoing off the bridge <br/>
high above.  Stop where the water dives over the rocks and down <br/>
towards the river.  <br/>
<br/>
Here you could clamber over the rocks and climb down steep steps cut <br/>
in the rock.  But you don't have to to find the letterbox.  We were <br/>
afraid it would wash away in a flood.  You go up.  From the waterfall <br/>
turn back the other way and very carefully follow the Potomac <br/>
Heritage Trail's blue blazes as they switchback up the hill.  Stop <br/>
before turning at the 4th switchback from the waterfall.  There is no <br/>
double blue blaze there indicating your U-turn but there are 3 flat-<br/>
topped rocks on your left to prevent erosion of the switchback path.  <br/>
Facing the river, with the 3 flat rocks at your feet on the left, you <br/>
are facing a tree.  At its base, a smaller fallen tree angles up.  <br/>
Look under a large flat rock under leaves behind the tree.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards I highly recommend the steep climb down to the river.  Old <br/>
steel handrails help.  Look for the old steam boiler in the water. <br/>
You can see a lot of drilled holes in the rocks.  They used to quarry <br/>
rock here for the capital's buildings.<br/>
