supposed to be posting about this new box on this site.<br/>
<br/>
Even if I'm not supposed to, I sort of have to because I forgot to <br/>
click on the box to add it to What's New.  So if I don't post here, <br/>
people will just have to stumble onto it by accident and we can't <br/>
have that.<br/>
<br/>
The new box, The Ultimate Hiker, was hidden near Black Rock Mill on <br/>
Easter Sunday.  We were in a hurry to get back to some fine home <br/>
cookin by our third member, Cat, so pardon us for the very short <br/>
hike.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
