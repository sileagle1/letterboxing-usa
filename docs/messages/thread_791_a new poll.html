I'm new to this, too, and we are stuck in a lot of snow, so my curiosity<br/>
will have to wait until after it melts!  There are no letterboxes in my<br/>
part of Washington, so when spring comes, me and the kids will drive down<br/>
to the Gorge area of the Washington/Oregon border and hunt...there are<br/>
several there.  <br/>
<br/>
Can't wait for my first "bag"...in the meantime, I'm carving stamps!<br/>

Since I'll only be there in spirit, my suggestions are from afar.  Since<br/>
you'll be in Mystic, I vote for equal parts sailing and letterboxing.  I<br/>
take my camping seriously; when I camp... I camp.  Personally, I would<br/>
be more interested in waking up in a comfortable Inn and heading out for<br/>
some morning letterboxing while the fog burns off and a breeze finds its<br/>
way into the harbor.  Then find a nice fleet of Haven 12.5's or maybe a<br/>
couple of Friendship Sloops for loan and set out for the horizon. <br/>
Picnic on the boats and then head back when the day turns cool.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for posting the new poll and the query, Bob, and for <br/>
organizing the chat last night! <br/>
<br/>
I got the feeling there was lots of enthusiasm and willingness to <br/>
make it work, despite a host of parameters that we were tossing <br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
My own summary would be that the three week-ends already mentioned in <br/>
the two polls are still the best candidates (last in April, first two <br/>
week-ends in May). The first of those two are not good for Kim Mako, <br/>
and after mid_may it gets tough for me and Steve Stary (who are <br/>
teachers), perhaps for some others. End of June on through the summer <br/>
is good for teachers, but not for Bonnie. Also, there was mention of <br/>
tourist crowds, bugs, and family vacations.<br/>
<br/>
The poll may help us sort this out. Also, don't hesitate to mention <br/>
conflicts or wishes here to the list in a more personal mode. I am <br/>
hoping it can take place in the spring slot currently being <br/>
considered. How nice to be looking forward to something like that <br/>
during Vermont's awful mud season.<br/>
<br/>
I'm still not clear on the camping issue. I love it myself and it's <br/>
cheap. I urged Bonnie that lack of gear would not be a problem. I <br/>
have lots of spare gear (I doubt my family will come with me this <br/>
time), and others do too. But it may be that the energy required to <br/>
set up, cook, etc. would detract from the boxing and socializing, <br/>
particularly for those who haven't camped much before. (Good point, <br/>
Thom!)  Or it might be great.<br/>
<br/>
Staying in an inn/motel would be fine with me too. How do people feel <br/>
about being divided into an out-crowd and an inn-crowd? If there turn <br/>
out to be as many people as was suggested last night (20-30), maybe <br/>
it wouldn't be so bad if we were split.. especially if we could all <br/>
get together at each of the different sites, e.g. hot tub/Guinness at <br/>
5:00, campfire at 9:00.<br/>
<br/>
Just musing out loud here. As I say, I don't think I have a focus on <br/>
this yet. Please jump into the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, many thanks to Bob &amp; Judy, Sara, Jay &amp; family, and all our <br/>
other CT hosts who will be working to put this together.<br/>

I hadn't planned on voting because the times being discussed conflict<br/>
with the sport orienteering season (which ends generally in mid June), <br/>
but I will be in New England a couple of weekends in April (Troll Cup, <br/>
Apr 15/16, Ashburnham, MA) and (Billygoat Run, Apr 30, Hillsborough, NH)<br/>
<br/>
If you folks pick one of these weekends, I'll try to drop by, and mabye<br/>
plant a mystery box the first weekend, and mabye pick it up the second :-)<br/>
