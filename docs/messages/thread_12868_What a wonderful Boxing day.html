Welcome home BTW.<br/>
<br/>
The Alphabet Bandits revisited the Vanderbilt box since half the Bandits lost their stamps after our last outing.  We were overjoyed to find 3 more on the grounds.  Very nice stamps.  The Baby Bandits liked the 3 part one best.  I'm torn between Hyde Park (the trail was cool ... we stamped the first two upside down then realized what it actually was LOL)  and Boating on the Hudson.<br/>
<br/>
It was also very cool being the first to stamp into the series.  That definately peaked everyone's interest... Our stamps are a little on the large size, so we stamped the fronts and back of the pages which used up 5 leaves of each booklet.<br/>
<br/>
Had we gotten an earlier start we'd have hit West (east) of the Hudson, but we got a later than intended start and less we have another adventure in the rain like we did with the Harriman Series, we decided to head home.    Next week for sure...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again<br/>
