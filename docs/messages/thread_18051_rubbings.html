                    <div class="plaintext-content">The papers, particularly the rice paper that was popularly used by many, <br/>
leave behind particles during the rubbing process. These particles/fibers expand <br/>
when they get wet (ie rain). This in turn breaks down the stone's surface very <br/>
quickly. <br/>
I did many rubbings during my college days and wish I still hadthem. Many of <br/>
the stones are nearly unreadable now. Just take a look in the old cemeteries <br/>
in Salem, MA the next time you are there. <br/>
****Of course the acid rain isn't helping much either!<br/>
