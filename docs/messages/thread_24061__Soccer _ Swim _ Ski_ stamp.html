I invite you to not find any more of my boxes. When I pulled my letterboxes <br/>
for maintenance and found your nasty notes, I was really disheartened. Of <br/>
course I don't appreicate being told my Fountain of Youth letterbox "sucks." It <br/>
took two entire weekends to walk those clues and then write them in rhyme for the <br/>
enjoyment of others, including you. But that didn't hurt as much as seeing a <br/>
whole page of my logbook written by a child lecturing me on all the different <br/>
ways I suck. I didn't laugh at the entry in the Dance Flurry letterbox telling <br/>
me you stole my stamp and were holding it for ransom. I'm glad you returned <br/>
it. Shame on all of you. Perhaps it is time to teach your children a golden <br/>
rule: "If you can't say anything nice..."<br/>
