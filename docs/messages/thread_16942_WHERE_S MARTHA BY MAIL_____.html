                    <div class="plaintext-content">Imagine my surprise when I arrive home after a long<br/>
trip away and found that the bench on my front porch<br/>
had been completely refinished - sanded down, stained,<br/>
and top coated to perfection.  My old yukky summer<br/>
plants had been pulled up and the mums which had been<br/>
sitting in pots by the garage were tasteully planted<br/>
and arranged at the entry way to my home, near my<br/>
lovely refurbed bench.  Even my herb plants had been<br/>
trimmed up nicely and winterized.<br/>
<br/>
My suprise quickly turned to chagrin when I saw<br/>
Martha, perched on the bench and somewhat perturbed,<br/>
although I would have never guessed it from a distance<br/>
- she had her flawless welcome-home look on her face. <br/>
Only the flashing eyes gave away that she felt my<br/>
treatment of her was completely unbecoming of a proper<br/>
hostess.  I asked her why she didn't use the key under<br/>
the doormat, to which she responded that it would have<br/>
been impolite to search for a key, much less to use<br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, I had cleaned thoroughly before I left on<br/>
my trip.  However, a few quick glances around made her<br/>
realize that my home, as well as my manners, may be a<br/>
hopeless cause.  I do plan on letting her relas a few<br/>
days before sending her on to her next victim, er, I<br/>
mean, cause.<br/>
