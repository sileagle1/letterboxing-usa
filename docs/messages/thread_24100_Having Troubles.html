What part of the U.S. are you located?<br/>
<br/>
Also, it's not a guaranteed trick, but looking for boxes that have been<br/>
found recently is one assurance that they will be there.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally, sometimes the box is there, the clues are just trickier than<br/>
we think.  <br/>
<br/>
Your best bet might be to contact the placer of some of these boxes to<br/>
confirm that the box is still there and ask for advice.  That's a great<br/>
way to get to know folks in your area.<br/>
<br/>
Best of Luck,<br/>

Second, YES, contact the placer.  When I can't find a box I always let them<br/>
know.  It may be missing.... or it may be my error.  I usually also send<br/>
them a picture of where I was looking because sometimes that can help<br/>
determine if it was me mistaking the clues or not.  On one particular box it<br/>
took 3 tries going back to find it before we actually got it!  But it is<br/>
possible, of course, that you have chosen 3 that are indeed missing.<br/>
<br/>
Looking for the last found date is often quite helpful.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Audi,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome! Don't get discouraged...there are lots of reasons that you might<br/>
not have found those boxes, including them having gone "missing" and having<br/>
them placed in an "off" spot by a previous finder. Do you know how to see<br/>
who has found the boxes via the clue pages on LbNA and Atlasquest? That can<br/>
be extremely helpful. If you see the latest entry was "attempted," then I<br/>
would not suggest you go looking for it at this point, b/c often that means<br/>
it is gone (not always, but perhaps usually, and we want you to have<br/>
success). If the box was found recently, then that might be a good one to<br/>
look for.<br/>
<br/>
For Christmas we went to visit my inlaws in Yellow Springs, Ohio, where<br/>
there was once a very prolific LB placer, so lots of boxes are listed on<br/>
LbNA. Unfortunately, he is not into it anymore, so his boxes were mostly<br/>
missing, or logbook was full, or box was there but no stamp. And, there is<br/>
only one or two box listed by other planters. It was SO FRUSTRATING!! If<br/>
that had been my first experience with boxing, I'm sure I would not have<br/>
continued with the hobby. As it is, I live in MA where there are loads of<br/>
AWESOME LB placers who are very active. So, I'm obsessed with the hobby now!<br/>
:-)  (And, my husband &amp; I planted 3 boxes in Yellow Springs, in the hopes<br/>
that it might spark some interest there for next time we return.)<br/>
<br/>
Where do you live? I agree with mizscarlet731 that it is really helpful--and<br/>
fun--to get in touch with other boxers in your area. You should definitely<br/>
email the person who planted the box to ask for help. As mizscarlet731 said,<br/>
some may not answer (especially if they are not active). However, I've found<br/>
that the vast majority of people I've contacted have responded, and they<br/>
have all been very friendly and helpful. As a planter, it's exciting when<br/>
someone finds my boxes, so I'd be thrilled to help anyone who might need an<br/>
extra hint.<br/>
<br/>
How old are your kids? If it's possible, you might consider finding a box by<br/>
yourself, first, so you know it is actually there to be found. If the kids<br/>
keep running into dead ends, their interest will probably fade quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Keep it up! You'll be rewarded! :-)<br/>

I often have three younger letterboxers with me, ages 11, 10 and 9.<br/>
The first box we looked for we did not find. OK I was afraid one of them <br/>
would go over the side of the mountain and I was distracted and did not follow the <br/>
direction correctly. I did return without them and yep, the box was there. We <br/>
will go back after the ice is off the road and the road to the top is open.<br/>
<br/>
I think they will take your lead. Finding the letterbox while is the point <br/>
the search is the important thing. I have incorporated plastic grocery bags in <br/>
the letterboxing kit. Sadly in some of the places we go there is quite a bit of <br/>
litter and the boys take pride in picking up the litter. A small reward but <br/>
nonetheless satisfying. They mark that in their books too. <br/>
<br/>
I print out the clues and keep them in a notebook with notes about the <br/>
expedition. They put their stamp on that page as attempted. LOL<br/>
There is not a failure just another aspect of letterboxing.<br/>
