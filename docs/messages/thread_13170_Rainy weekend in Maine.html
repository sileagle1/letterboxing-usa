                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, it just turns out that we happened to be up in Maine this past <br/>
weekend, too!  We had actually hoped to get up there earlier and join <br/>
TGD and RIBNAG for some letterboxing sunshine, but we stalled too <br/>
long in getting started, so mostly just got the rain! A belated foray <br/>
up Cadillac Mt. put us within minutes into some mind-bogglingly <br/>
brutal weather conditions, so we quickly decided it wasn't worth <br/>
risking hypothermia for any more boxes on the "Cold Coast" and left <br/>
for the "Bold Coast"! In spite of the continued rain and sloshing up <br/>
to our ankles along the swamped floating bog bridges there, we found <br/>
that area to be absolutely magnificent! Pete fell and sprained his <br/>
hand again on a stream crossing near the letterbox at the far end of <br/>
the 6-mile loop, but at least we managed to avoid getting sucked into <br/>
any Psychomommy-type mud adventures out there so many miles from <br/>
nowhere! That evening we did Martian Maggot's other wonderful <br/>
letterbox hike up that way on Campobello Island, where a nice <br/>
Canadian ranger was just about to come looking for us because he <br/>
thought we'd gotten hurt or lost in the dark! One short rain-free <br/>
window of opportunity on the way home the next day gave us a chance <br/>
to visit a fine eagle cliff near Bangor, and then, of course, both <br/>
coming and going we managed to pick up several more boxes at other <br/>
interesting spots in Maine, like Pemaquid Point, Fort Frederick, Fort <br/>
Halifax, etc. so, the long drive was definitely not a "washout"! We <br/>
still managed to do our usual 20-box weekend - just this time not <br/>
including 8 or 10 legerdemaine boxes as had been the case on a couple <br/>
of our previous Maine letterboxing weekends! At any rate, it's great <br/>
to see that there are now some new players up there in Maine who have <br/>
already found the hitchers we left behind, and several others now <br/>
putting in boxes all over the place! Thanks to all of you!<br/>
