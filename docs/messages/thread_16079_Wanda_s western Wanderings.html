Wanda is now on her way between CDT work trips, going from <br/>
clearing and signing trails in Rocky Mt National Park to building <br/>
new trail on BLM lands in New Mexico.  She says she hasn't had <br/>
much time for peak bagging or letterboxing lately, but did <br/>
manage to climb one more 14'er, the Angel of Shavano, and <br/>
reached F3333 on her letterbox count, especially enjoying hikes <br/>
with letterbox in the Maroon Bells and the Weminuche <br/>
Wilderness.  She also dropped off two more of RTRW's boxes, <br/>
one near Durango, CO at Animas Overlook and the other in a box <br/>
canyon near Ghost Ranch, NM.  I'll be posting the clues soon.<br/>

Boy does that sound great -- I still remember with great fondness a<br/>
summer spent doing field research in the Maroon Bells while in<br/>
college.  An incredibly beautiful part of Colorado!<br/>
