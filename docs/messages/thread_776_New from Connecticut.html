<br/>
And I thought winter was going to slow you down!<br/>
<br/>
Your map looks good. What I think I'll do for now is put up a dot on <br/>
the state map for Middletown, and link from it directly to your <br/>
clues, without going through the map. This is what I've done with <br/>
other town dots that have only one box (e.g. Mt. Monadnock, <br/>
Longmeadow).<br/>
<br/>
When more boxes are up in the Middletown or Hartford area, we can <br/>
decide what regional maps could best blanket the area. Hartford might <br/>
have its own map, Meriden/Middletown another. <br/>
<br/>
It looks as though your map is right on target in terms ox extending <br/>
southeast to Higganum and south to Durham; it makes for a smooth <br/>
continuation of the areas shown on the Cochester and New Haven maps.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to start a Notepad textfile in which you keep the <br/>
Tiger Map Server URL's of each map you generate. Save the address <br/>
before you convert it into a downloadable GIF. That way you can <br/>
always go back to the same map and make changes (e.g. put in lat/long <br/>
grid lines, take out county or city boundaries, or whatever.)<br/>
<br/>
I'm sending you the URL address for Lyme. You can see the different <br/>
features I've clicked on and off if you go there. This is the format <br/>
into which I've finally settled, after much trial and error.<br/>

Tell me if my mail program chops this up into unusable fragments, and <br/>
I'll try again in another format.<br/>

content...<br/>
<br/>
Barb &amp; Larry's Ledges<br/>
<br/>
A pair of letterboxes high on a traprock ridge with breathtaking views<br/>
to the west on the classic and popular Mattabasset Trail over Mt Higby<br/>
in Middletown, CT. Difficulty: quite strenuous climbing and ridgeline<br/>
scrambling: avoid in icy winter weather. This hike covers about 2 miles<br/>
in 2 hours.<br/>
 Directions:  At the western end of CT Rte. 66, just before it blends<br/>
into I-691 (and just west of Guida's Diner at Rte. 147), watch for a<br/>
roadside pullout and blue blazes on the northern side of the highway.<br/>
There is a Mattabasset Trail sign. Alternatively, there is parking at<br/>
Guida's and a purple-blazed connector trail heading west from the diner.<br/>
Hike north from the roadway on any of the paths you see to the blue<br/>
blazed Mattabasset Trail and turn left to climb a short but intense<br/>
burst to the top of the ridge. Continuing with the trail, dip down<br/>
northwest and cross a level area before dipping again into a small<br/>
valley and then up to the beginning of the great views. The trail turns<br/>
north along the ridgeline. A short way farther will bring you into a<br/>
small cedar grove: watch for the Mount Higby Letterbox in a small cairn<br/>
off the trail on the right (east).<br/>
Continue north, enjoying the truly fabulous views, and cross the<br/>
sometimes crowded summit. Hike along the ridge about  mile to an open<br/>
flat area that really opens the views northward to Mt Higby. Again, off<br/>
the trail to the east, find the Northern View Letterbox in a small<br/>
cairn. Stamp in and then simply retrace your steps home.<br/>
