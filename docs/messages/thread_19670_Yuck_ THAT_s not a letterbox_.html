                    <div class="plaintext-content">Something pretty gross happened to me while letterboxing last <br/>
weekend.  Please read this to prevent becoming a victim (or--gasp--a <br/>
perpetrator) yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Since I'm always noticing great potential hiding spots along the <br/>
trail, and because I noticed a sign at the trailhead discussing the <br/>
growing popularity of geocaching in the area, when I spotted an <br/>
unusually placed rock inside a hollow tree trunk next to the trail, <br/>
of course I looked under it.  Naturally, I was expecting to find a <br/>
little treasure--maybe I'd discovered a geocache by accident?--but <br/>
NO!  My curiosity was rewarded with a big blob of disgusting TOILET <br/>
PAPER!<br/>
<br/>
I spend a lot of time outdoors and I've noticed a growing problem <br/>
with this gross white stuff appearing all over the place.  All too <br/>
often, it's right out in the open and not far enough from the <br/>
trail.  To make matters worse, now that letterboxing actually has me <br/>
willingly looking under carefully arranged sticks or rocks and <br/>
accidentally finding stuff that nobody was ever supposed to find, <br/>
even those people who bother to conceal their mess but do it poorly <br/>
and in a conspicuous place are also becoming a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I like to think that the chances that a letterboxer would do such a <br/>
yucky thing are slim.  But as a group, we do spend a decent amount <br/>
of time out there, and chances are that nature has called on all of <br/>
us at one time or another when there were no facilities in sight.  <br/>
If it hasn't happened to you yet, it probably will.  So I thought I <br/>
might take this opportunity to remind everyone here that it's not <br/>
acceptable to leave any kind of litter out there, including your <br/>
toilet paper.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the commonly accepted rules regarding this issue as I <br/>
understand them:<br/>
<br/>
To protect water quality and the aesthetics of the wilderness, you <br/>
must bury any human waste at least 6" deep and at least 100' from <br/>
water sources, camp areas or trails.  Pack out all toilet paper.<br/>
<br/>
So if you can't restrict yourself to using the porta-potty at the <br/>
trail head, and if you must use toilet paper, please also bring a <br/>
few extra zip locks so you can pack it out.  I know packing it out <br/>
is less than fun, so if you don't want to do that, then get yourself <br/>
some biodegradable TP and a little plastic shovel at an outdoor <br/>
store so you can bury it at least 6" deep and at least 100 feet from <br/>
the trail, water and camp areas.  (Ladies, same thing goes for your <br/>
girl stuff.  Pack it out.  I don't want it in my bag either, but <br/>
it's the only way.)<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that's too much to ask!  Please feel free to pass this <br/>
advice on to anyone else who might need to know this important <br/>
information!  I think we all stand to benefit from this one.  If <br/>
everyone followed the rules, then every letterboxer would be free to <br/>
look under any rock within 100 feet of the trail without the fear of <br/>
finding something they weren't looking for!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening, <br/>

There is a wonderful book by Kathleen Meyer - entitled: "How to - - - t in the <br/>
woods"  I kid you not, I've actually read it. This might be worthwhile for some folks <br/>
to pick up. It is a very serious concern in more fragile wildnerness areas especially <br/>
alipne areas. <br/>

But I always have a few ziploc bags with me, just in case I want to take <br/>
something home.  The idea of using it for...well....you know...never occured to <br/>
me, but hey, it works.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a fanny pack that I used for hiking; it has a notebook, a compass, a <br/>
nature guide, a knife, some ziploc bags, and some other things; when I started <br/>
letterboxing, I just added a stamp pad and a stamp!  The notebook has sketches <br/>
and notes from earlier adventures; the stamps just add a new dimension to it. <br/>
 :-)<br/>
<br/>
I should probably add some gloves to the mix, just in case...<br/>

Oh, gosh, that'll seal whatever's left of my reputation.<br/>
<br/>
Just make sure when you're digging your six inch hole, don't cut <br/>
into an electric line by accident and knock out power to several <br/>
million people.  It could be embarrassing.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
The "How To S**T In the Woods" book is pretty funny.  I've only read <br/>
parts of it mostly to amuse my easily amused mind, but it does have <br/>
good info!<br/>
<br/>
But if you really want to hear my suggestions: It's a lot easier <br/>
to 'do your thing' in civilization.  Get it all out *before* you get <br/>
on the trail!  The only people who should be doing stuff out in the <br/>
woods are those with bowel problems and those who haven't seen <br/>
alternative means for doing your thing for at least 24 hours.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Even on the AT I could usually find a privy when a privy was <br/>
needed....  (Be careful when they're REALLY full, though, and don't <br/>
go alone--people have been known to get locked in by accident when <br/>
the lock closed behind them!!!)<br/>

Isn't the lock in the inside? This is similar to when some folks use <br/>
an airplane toilet for the first time and for some reason they have a <br/>
difficult time figuring out how the door works. <br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>

<br/>
Well, no.  At least most of the privies on the AT have a way to lock <br/>
the door from the outside to keep porcupines, skunks, and other <br/>
undesireables out.  In cities and towns, that's usually not a big <br/>
problem.  Out on the trail--well, you don't want to accidentally sit <br/>
on a skunk when you're preoccupied with other things....<br/>
<br/>
So trail privies have locks on the outside for when the privy is not <br/>
in use, and a lock on the inside for when the privy is in use.<br/>
<br/>
And I heard about at least one guy who accidentally got locked in <br/>
with a VERY full privy and there was nobody around to get him out.  <br/>
Apparently, it was a very unpleasant situation....<br/>

&lt;&lt; On another bright note, do remember that many of the natural things <br/>
around you are quite nice and refreshing for cleaning up other body <br/>
parts. And the best part is: If you use leaves, smooth rocks, or <br/>
whatever, you CAN leave that behind.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Of course, it pays to check out this site about identifying poison ivy<br/>
before selecting your "natural thing" for body-cleansing!:<br/>
