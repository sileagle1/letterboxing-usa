<br/>
After taking *waaaaay* too long, we have finally repaired<br/>
and returned our "Dust To Dust" and "Get Lost" LetterBoxes<br/>
at the Bangor City Forest in Bangor, Maine.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the clue to "Dust To Dust" has changed slightly...<br/>
Old stumps have a way of disintegrating over the course of<br/>
six years (next month), and the former home of this LB did<br/>
not get an exception to that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have also started using a new container, and would love<br/>
to hear comments on how well they hold up.  Rather than the<br/>
standard rectangular food container, we have switched to<br/>
24oz (working on getting some 16oz) 120mm straight-walled<br/>
polypropylene jars, in the hopes that they will have the<br/>
water resistance of Skippy jars but the ruggedness of most<br/>
food storage containers.<br/>
<br/>
