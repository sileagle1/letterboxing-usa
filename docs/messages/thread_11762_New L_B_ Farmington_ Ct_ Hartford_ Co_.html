1.5 mi. round trip<br/>
<br/>
On the north side of Rt. 6  near the New Britain Ave. traffic light is an<br/>
old run down pavilion. On it's west side is a sandy driveway where you<br/>
can pull in and park. Walk between a big tree and the pavilion (with the<br/>
pavilion on your right) and you'll see a faint path which becomes a blue<br/>
blazed trial after passing a brown and yellow sign that says Shade Swamp<br/>
Nature Trail. The cages you pass by are the remains of an old roadside<br/>
wildlife area that was abandoned in the early 60's.<br/>
The trails are poorly marked so watch carefully for the blazes. Much of<br/>
the trail follows a glacial "kame terrace", a kame being a ridge or hill<br/>
formed of gravel deposited by glacial streams during the last ice age,<br/>
which is where this box got it's name instead of being some mediocre king<br/>
of the hill. After crossing a wooden bridge you'll see a # 4 on a tree<br/>
and at the top of  a small incline a # 6.<br/>
At this tree go left and up a slightly larger incline to the top of the<br/>
kame. 15 paces across level ground you'll see the open portion of Shade<br/>
Swamp with the Pequabuck River on you right and on your left is a twin<br/>
sister tree with multiple blazes. Looking through the V, site 280 degrees<br/>
to a log on the ground and at the end in an obvious pile of letterboxing<br/>
debris is King of the Kame. <br/>
I also left a map for you to memorize or sketch for your options on<br/>
returning to your car. If you choose to do both of the loops, be sure to<br/>
watch for blazes because the second loop is even more poorly marked. Or<br/>
you can return the way you came, by turning right at the tree with the #<br/>
6 on it. Have fun.<br/>
