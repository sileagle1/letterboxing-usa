<div>Just got back from Atlanta. Met a guy from 
Sacramento at a business technical session. Got to talking about hiking and 
before you know it, the subject of letterboxing came up. : - }</div>
<div>Making a long story short, he asked to go with 
me to find the Easter Egg Letterbox on the Emory University Campus in Atlanta. 
He also called up the webpage, found 3 boxes near his home, plans to get those 
when he gets back, plans to hide at least on in Hawaii (Oahu) this summer, and 
several along the coast of California in coves that he will sail into. Looks 
like we have found another avid letterboxer.</div>
<div>Oh, by the way, the Easter Egg Letterbox, is 
fine. It now has four visitors [1- Atlanta, 2- New England, and 
1-California].</div>
<div>Glad to hear that the gathering was a success, 
this makes both winter gatherings I have missed due to business trips. : -
