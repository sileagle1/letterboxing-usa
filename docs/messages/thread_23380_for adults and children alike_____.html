                    <div class="plaintext-content">well, i finally have my plan for my blogsite.<br/>
<br/>
http://teamnewhampshire.blogspot.com<br/>
<br/>
i figured that i would post something new every week. anytime team <br/>
new hampshire goes out boxing, we will post our adventures on our <br/>
site, just as anyone else would. i thought that since i bit of my <br/>
boxes planted in NH are about gingerbread jim, i would post a <br/>
segment every monday about gingerbread jim and his adventures. for <br/>
the children. on the first of every month, i have a segment <br/>
called "15 minutes." it is basicly an interview with someone at <br/>
random. also for the children mostly. for everyone else, there are <br/>
our adventures boxing in various places. i want to post helpful <br/>
boxing hints for new comers and oldies alike. anything that would be <br/>
helpful. i don't want to have the best site, but i want to have <br/>
others enjoy our site.<br/>
<br/>
i would like to know what everyone thinks about this. i want people <br/>
to know about our little part of the country. if you have any <br/>
suggestions on making my site better, please let me know.<br/>
