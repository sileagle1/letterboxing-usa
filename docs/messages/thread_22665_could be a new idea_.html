Have you ever played the game where you start a story and then at a<br/>
spot in the story you hand it off to the next person who passes it on<br/>
to the next person. Well what if you do that with a letterbox. Like<br/>
first you do your box then you leave another box (log book and stamp)<br/>
inside the box. The first person who finds the box has to continue the<br/>
story with the box they found and make another box to put in thier<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes!  I think it is called "A Walk in the Woods at Midnight" or <br/>
something like that.  But from what I recollect, Turtle McQ always <br/>
kept it with her, and brought it to gatherings (I didn't get to put <br/>
in my part of the story in it until about the third gathering where <br/>
we were both present).<br/>
<br/>
As far as the "hitchhiker/chainletter" portion of it, the logbook <br/>
would need to be rather large, so it would probably have to have its <br/>
own waterproof container and be planted *with* a permanent letterbox <br/>
(and carried on to the next box) rather than *inside* (has anyone <br/>
noticed that letterbox containers are getting smaller and smaller and <br/>
sometimes even the smallest HH can't fit inside?).<br/>
<br/>
I personally would be delighted to find such a "continuing story" box.<br/>
