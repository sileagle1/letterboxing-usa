                    <div class="plaintext-content">Randy, I agree with your statements about the clues.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that if I write clues and people find the box without extra <br/>
hints/help, that proves the clues are understandable. The fact that <br/>
SOME people can't find the box does not make MY clues suspect.<br/>
If the case was that ALL people could not find my boxes using the <br/>
clues, then I would suspect my clue writing ability.<br/>
<br/>
I voluntarily decided to participate in letterboxing, and take all <br/>
the risks and rewards that come with it.<br/>
If I should run across a clue or set of clues that I can not solve, <br/>
then maybe I am not in the right frame of mind to be looking for that <br/>
box today, I'll try again another time, or not, it's my choice. I <br/>
certainly don't blame the clue writer!<br/>
<br/>
Let's all try to remember that this activity is for each individual's <br/>
enjoyment, however that individual interprets enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
Isn't there and old saying something about "let he who is without <br/>
guilt cast the first stone".<br/>
<br/>
Who on this list qualifies??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Now, regarding pulling my clues -- this is about two things, the <br/>
&gt; implicit belief that if the hunter gets lost or has some other<br/>
&gt; misfortune, or causes damage to the park, the clue is somehow to <br/>
&gt; blame, or that the writer owes the hunter some sort of fun.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is not the case, but I sensed belief in this sentiment<br/>
&gt; in the NJ incident when Todd briefly pulled some of his clues, <br/>
&gt; and sense this sentiment now.  I guess I feel my clues are like<br/>
&gt; GNU software, take them for what they are worth, and use them if<br/>
&gt; you want, but they don't owe anyone anything.  I spend alot of<br/>
&gt; time on them and they are a labor of love, if you like them great,<br/>
&gt; if you ignore them fine, but there is simply no place for repeatedly<br/>
&gt; criticizing clues after the criticism has been acknowledged, or<br/>
&gt; expecting the clues to provide some level of enjoyment or be written<br/>
&gt; in such a way that the probability of misinterpretation is below <br/>
some<br/>
&gt; percentage or that they will be immune to changes in the landscape<br/>
&gt; is below some percentage, or that they be checked on some number<br/>
&gt; of times per year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Todd chose to revise his clues.  I do not feel my clues would take<br/>
&gt; to the recommended revisions and retain their appeal to those <br/>
&gt; who enjoy them, including myself, nor do I feel revision would <br/>
&gt; eliminate this problem in principle -- if the clue is 'walk outside <br/>
&gt; and look in your mailbox, and make sure you take the cobblestone <br/>
&gt; walkway from your door to the mailbox, and make sure it is the<br/>
&gt; red mailbox adjacent to the Japanese maple', the problem remains, <br/>
&gt; in principle.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rather than debate this, as there is a real frustrating sense that <br/>
&gt; the community is not interested in dealing with heavy issues <br/>
&gt; (from me, anyway), and rather than continue to risk that the <br/>
hunters <br/>
&gt; expectations are different than my assumptions of them (despite<br/>
&gt; mountains of verbiage about this issue on my web site and numerous <br/>
&gt; explanations on-list), I chose the only rational response available.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will be exploring alternatives to allow the clues to remain on-<br/>
line<br/>
&gt; for all to view, as sample/historical work, but those alternatives <br/>
&gt; will cost money, so I'm not sure this will happen.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers<br/>
