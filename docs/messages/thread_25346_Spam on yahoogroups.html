                    <div class="plaintext-content">A note from one of your happy group moderators: yahoogroups across the land are experiencing a surge of "spoofing." Our own group here is set to First Post Moderation, which means that the first time a new member tries to post a note one of us moderators reads it and approves or deletes it. This, believe it or not, screens out 99% of the spam members would otherwise see.<br/>
<br/>
But if somebody who has already made a first post gets spoofed, that spam email will come through unmoderated. One of the problems with spoofs is that a message might look like it comes from somebody you know but it probably doesn't actually come from them at all. Their email is already in your address book so the nasty person sending the spam is disguised as someone you know. Your email friend feels terrible that their computer is infected but that's not always the case. Slippery scammers!<br/>
<br/>
So rest assured that we're doing everything possible to keep the list clean and family friendly. And finally, please do not respond to spam on the group, just delete it from you inbox. In fact, you might not even respond to this little note: the less we discuss spam the more we can talk about boxing.<br/>

Thanks, Jay in CT <br/>
