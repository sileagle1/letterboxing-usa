                    <div class="plaintext-content">Prompted by my upcoming relocation to a town not serviced by my <br/>
current cable provider, who also hosts my letterboxing website, I <br/>
decided to register a domain and move my site to a neutral host.  But <br/>
what domain?  Letterboxing.com, .org, and .info are all taken, and <br/>
too generic in my opinion for what my site is (basically an <br/>
electronic version of my journal).  CPAScott.com, believe it or not, <br/>
is also taken, by some Accounting Professor also named Scott.  <br/>
InVinoVeritas as well as just VinoVertias, my sig stamp's slogan, <br/>
were also taken.<br/>
<br/>
I pondered and pondered -- what could I call my website's new domain <br/>
that fit in with the hobby and me and wasn't yet taken?  I could come <br/>
up with nothing that seemed to work until I stumbled upon, yes, <br/>
Hunting Tupperware -- there it was, free and clear for my taking.  <br/>
And so I took it.<br/>
<br/>
Introducing HuntingTupperware.com -- the new letterboxing-related <br/>
site hosted by yours truly.  Coming soon to a web browser near you!  <br/>
Of course, the site won't offer much more than my current site hosted <br/>
at comcast as it's primary purpose is to simply be an electronic <br/>
journal of my letterboxing adventures and host to boxes I've placed.  <br/>
But the name is kind of neat anyway, don't you think?<br/>
<br/>
And who knows, if I can ever score a copy of Dreamweaver for less <br/>
than the price of a car payment, maybe I could once-and-for-all <br/>
abandon FrontPage and spruce up the site a bit.  (Hint, nudge, for <br/>
anyone with ideas on that).<br/>
<br/>
For the time being though, I'll simply move the old, ugly and <br/>
cumbersome FrontPage site from home.comcast.net to <br/>
HuntingTupperware.com.  If you've bookmarked my old site (not sure <br/>
why you would, but just in case), be sure to update the links!<br/>

Yep, it is neat,but you might want to stay pretty low on the radar <br/>

Hi Doug<br/>
Yep, that is exactly what I meant. When I was still doing PI work I <br/>
had two friends that made a very good living chasing down replica <br/>
stuff (Rolex knock offs, etc) and also working on trademark <br/>
infringements. Disney used to be the most ardent in hunting folks <br/>
down and prosecuting lawsuits. I'm still hesitant to use anything <br/>
Disney in a stamp image even though I know that is such a small <br/>
unadvertised item.<br/>
Are you guys back from Scotland? Where is your report?<br/>
<br/>

point they tried to sue Olympic National Park in Washington and the <br/>
surrounding area businesses for using 'Olympics' in their names (the <br/>
mountains in the area are known as the Olympic Mountains and most <br/>
locals refer to them as the Olympics or the Olympic Peninsula). They <br/>
also sued the US Army for using Worldwide Language Olympics in their <br/>
annual language ability competition for linguists.  The Army <br/>
eventually changed the competition to something like Worldwide <br/>
Language Competition instead. Yep, lots of folks are pretty strict <br/>
when it comes to protecting trademarks out there.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
BUT if companies don't fight furiously and seriously about protecting  <br/>
their copyright, there is some chance of losing it.. I don't fully  <br/>
understand it, but it has been explained to me  by an attorney and  <br/>
made sense at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Which makes sense then that companies protect copyright so closely -  <br/>
especially big ones with lots to lose.<br/>
