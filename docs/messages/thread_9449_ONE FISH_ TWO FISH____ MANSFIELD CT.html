<br/>
Took the cub scout den on letterbox hike in the snow yesterday to <br/>
Mansfield Hollow Park--Found "Opening Day" Box in good condition.... <br/>
searched for "One Fish, Two Fish, Red fish, Blue Fish" and couldn't <br/>
find it!  Maybe it was the snow?? It seemed that there were a few <br/>
options along the way that maybe we didn't look in the right spot.. <br/>
just wondering if anyone has been to the box lately--the kids want to <br/>
try again --maybe when the snow melts..<br/>
