Location:  Holcomb Farm  West Granby, CT (Hartford County)<br/>
Placed by:  Tree Fairy and Chester Copperpot on August 11, 2002<br/>
Difficulty:  Medium (some hills and stairs)<br/>
Time:  up to 1 hour<br/>
Notes:  Please watch children when hiking along the ridge.  Also, be <br/>
aware that we are in the process of revising our trail markings.  <br/>
Therefore, it is suggested that you follow these directions in <br/>
reverse order to return to the farm.  Please carry out what you take <br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Holcomb Farm:  From the center of Granby, take Route 20 <br/>
West approximately 2.5 miles to Day Street South on the left.  Follow <br/>
Day Street South a short distance to the end.  You can't miss the big <br/>
red barns directly in front of you that mark Holcomb Farm.  <br/>
<br/>

Oops!  We forgot to close the chicken coop gate last night!  When we <br/>
came in this morning we saw Mr. Fox carrying Clucky away!  We need <br/>
your help to find Clucky before it is too late! <br/>
<br/>
We saw Mr. Fox run behind the building with the cow weathervanes on <br/>
the top and down a grassy hill towards a wooden bridge.  Can you <br/>
believe that sly fox crossed the bridge and went under both gates of <br/>
the farmer's field?  (Please be sure to latch the two gates behind <br/>
you.)  Mr. Fox headed north when he came to Salmon Brook and crossed <br/>
over another wooden bridge.  Once across the rocky beach he went into <br/>
the flood plain forest.  He continued along the trail until he came <br/>
to a set of wooden stairs on the left that ascended the side of the <br/>
ridge. Once at the top of the stairs, he trotted south along the edge <br/>
of the ridge.  After resting on a mossy stump a little way along the <br/>
ridge on the left, he continued following the contours of the ridge <br/>
traveling up and down a few hills.  Mr. Fox passed right by a Boy <br/>
Scout camp, marked by a small white structure on the right.  Too bad <br/>
the Boy Scouts weren't there to save Clucky!  He then quickly ran <br/>
along the trail, past the camp, and continued a short distance to the <br/>
campfire circle.  Mr. Fox set a plate for himself at the picnic table <br/>
and bounded off to collect tinder in order to cook his feast.  While <br/>
Mr. Fox was gathering tinder, our courageous chicken, Clucky, snuck <br/>
away to the west, staying on the trail.  Clucky went south at the <br/>
trail intersection and ran down the hill towards the wooden bridge <br/>
that crosses over Beech Brook.  Searching frantically for a place to <br/>
hide, Clucky dove under the left side of the bridge hopeful that the <br/>
sound of the babbling brook would hide any noises she made.  Please <br/>
find Clucky and make sure Mr. Fox does not eat her by stamping her <br/>
into your stamp pad and leaving your own stamp in the book.<br/>
<br/>
Please return Clucky to her hiding spot so Mr. Fox won't find her!  <br/>
Thanks for helping Holcomb Farm save Clucky, the Unlucky Chicken!<br/>
