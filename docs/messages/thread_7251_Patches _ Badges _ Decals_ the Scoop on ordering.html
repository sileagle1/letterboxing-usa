                    <html><body>HI everyone!   I haven't checked my email lately and then this morning saw a slew of bulk order emails from the LbNA group.  Sorry for not answering until now.<br/>
<br/>
FYI:<br/>
<br/>
The LbNA patches are for anyone who enjoys letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
The merit badges come in denominations of 10,25,50,75,100, and more. P=planted, F=found, X-exchanged.<br/>
<br/>
The window cling/decals come in three styles.<br/>
<br/>
Ordering FYI:<br/>
<br/>
The LbNA regalia page has the ordering info BUT some addresses and prices have changed so please go to this temporary site FIRST: <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/mohmers/myhomepage/business.html">LbNA regalia updates</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Then click on the link the official LbNA page to print out the forms ... be sure to mail them to the corrected addresses.<br/>
<br/>
Biggest point:  the merit badges are now cheaper but must be ordered in quantities of 10.<br/>
<br/>
The logo patches are ordered in bulks of 50 ...send your order into Town Hall and they will hold it until they get the minimum order of 50 ...so be prepared to wait a little while.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
The clear decals must be ordered 25 at a time.  The white decals can be ordered individually.<br/>
<br/>
I do have some extra X 75 merit badges due to an embroidery error... please send a note to me if you are interested.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting, Mohmers<br/>
