For those that don't like lengthy letterbox reports please excuse this post.  We just received Honor Liberty and even while it is past the anniversary date we felt this report should be posted. Normally a Hitch Hiker report is found on the HH chat list, but with other different aspects of this HH, the report is being filed on this list. A short explanation for those newer letterboxers is probably in order, so here goes; After 9/11/2001, I wanted never to see the Towers coming down as was shown over and over on TV. As more time passed I changed my mind and believe that we should probably have that scene replayed several times each year to make sure we never forget the horror. With that sentiment Honor Liberty HH was launched on 9/11/2002 with specific instructions to post on the chat list it's current location, and write in the logbook any sentiments the finder wished. In some cases the race was on when ever the location was posted, and in other cases the new finder was reluctant to post the new location due to the procedure being contrary to normal procedures for Hitch Hikers. The first year's travels can be found in message # 34174, dated October 03, 2003. The following is a list of those locations and letterboxers that commented during her travels this past year. (Please excuse any omissions or errors).<br/>
