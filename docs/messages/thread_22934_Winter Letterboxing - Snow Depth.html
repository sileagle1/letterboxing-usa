hiking. I am in the midst of planning a rather large winter event and <br/>
was lucky enough to get a lot of planting tips from hardy winter <br/>
boxers. It's funny..I thought I would spend a lot of my winter just <br/>
carving stamps, but it looks like I will be out there after all!<br/>
<br/>
I know a few of my boxes are NOT safe in the winter, as they include <br/>
climbing up and down rock faces. So I am hoping no one attempts those. <br/>
