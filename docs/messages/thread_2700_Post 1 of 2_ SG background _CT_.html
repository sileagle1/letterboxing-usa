                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is a cave on Sleeping Giant Mountain. A long time ago, when the Giant was still known as the Blue Hills,<br/>
the cave was called "Abraham's Cave." I know not why. Then, in 1873, a few boys went looking for the cave on a<br/>
crisp April day. They found it, and found a dead man inside as well.<br/>
<br/>
The death was ruled a suicide. Back then, no autopsy was performed, but the man's co-workers reported that he<br/>
had been moody and dispondent, his landlady said he had disappeard a few weeks before, and he took with him a<br/>
bottle of laudanum. He was dressed in his Sunday best when he was found, so it does fit that he caused his own<br/>
death intentionally. Anyway, since that day the cave has been referred to as "Dead Man's Cave."<br/>
<br/>
Now, our local geology doesn't really lend itself to proper caves. Most "caves" are really rock overhangs or<br/>
pockets in boulder tumbles. This is a proper cave, though, it has three chambers, extending underground some<br/>
40 or more feet. To reach the first chamber, one must drop down a 5 ft. slide, then go though a squeeze, and<br/>
drop again about 8 ft. Then there is a large room. The other two chambers can only be reached by crawling on<br/>
one's belly--not for me--and I can't describe these deeper rooms.<br/>
<br/>
On July 3rd, we placed the Merlin's Grotto letterbox near the cave entrance. LB Seekers will NOT have to enter<br/>
the cave to get the box, though the option is there for those adventuresome souls. As all healthy terrestrial<br/>
ecosystems have arachnids, there is no shortage of spiders here--don't attempt descent if this freaks you out.<br/>

<br/>
Great history lesson on that cave at Sleeping Giant!  I sure wish I<br/>
could get over that way and check out your Merlin letterbox.  I would go<br/>
into the cave.  I'm not afraid of caves nor spiders.  Sounds like it<br/>
would be a terrific hunt.<br/>
<br/>
