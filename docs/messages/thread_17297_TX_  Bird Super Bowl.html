                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today my family took advantage of another beautiful day <br/>
to visit the Matagorda County Birding Nature Center in <br/>
Bay City.  It is known as the "Super Bowl of the Christmas<br/>
Bird Count" because it holds the record for the most species<br/>
counted in one day, 243 on 12/19/02.  Though we didn't see<br/>
that many, we did see quite a few, including:  Crested Caracara,<br/>
Red-bellied Woodpecker, Kestrel, Yellow-rumped Warbler, Red-<br/>
tailed Hawk, and many cardinals &amp; chickadees.  We also saw<br/>
many types of butterflies and gardens full of flowers.  Of<br/>
course, I had to place a box while there so others will<br/>
hopefully be coerced to visit.  It really is a special place<br/>
and not too far from Houston, so go for it!<br/>
