                    <html><body><div><div>Team BeMa is very, very, even very, very, very proud to announce that we have finally found the friendly froggy (and his lady love)!!!  Thank you to everyone who encouraged us to keep looking and offered little hints!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Looking back...  What were we thinking?!!  Where were we looking?!  Well, a lot of dogs do use those paths (not to mention a lot of geese) so maybe we were looking to avoid poopie instead of sighting important trees, etc.  Regardless -- this time we were successful.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Froggie #1..  Brings to mind that 'old Barry Manilow classic "we looked high, low, every where we possibly can, but there's no...."  Only in this case, we had looked to the right, to the left, but never straight ahead (as clearly stated in the clues....)  Froggy was a prince of a stamp to find.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Froggy #3...  Unwilling to tackly the blue blaze trail again (still recovering from bad back, bad knee and kids who are still 8 and 5...) we worked backwards to find this one.  Although it is still quite a trek to the famer's house and fence.  It was REALLY NICE having a map this time not to mention an idea as to where we were headed and how far away (and it what direction) lay our car!...  Again -- I don't know how we missed the big oak tree.  I think we were still looking for the fallen ones...  The lovebirds' rendevous is still safe and dry.  The log books are beautiful and the stamps are so nicely backed!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Froggy #4..  Luckily, the warm wool hats blocked out (or at least deadened) some of the whining as we headed back from #3 to find #4 and the really cool coloring pages back at the visitor's center.  I have to say, it is truly odd how tired the kids get on the trails, yet, the minute we get home, they jump all over the famly room furniture (in muddy pants [though, hopefully, not muddy sneakers too!])  Boy, I guess they really recharge in the car!?!...  Froggy's hot date was staying at least warm in this cold weather.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As we headed back to the car, I amazed at the amount of mud kicked up on the pants of the two kids, not to mention the husband.  How is it that my pants stayed clean despite the fact I was the only one not wearing tied-on shoes which kept getting sucked into the mud?!  There must be a magic aura around the one who actually has to do the laundry that keeps his/her clothes neat...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks Froggy and friends for a great afternoon!  BeMa</div>
