<br/>
I just want to say that I love being right.  I especially love being right <br/>
when my older brother is wrong.  I am over 40 years old and I still get this <br/>
adolescent rush.  Had it been my decision, the new box would have been called <br/>
the Burned Turkey Letterbox, because that was the name of the loop we were <br/>
walking.  My brother insisted I was wrong, that the loop name was spelled <br/>
"burnt".  Okay, fine, we spelled it they way he wanted.  Let's just say that <br/>
later, when researching the trail name, my brother still wouldn't give in <br/>
totally and he insisted, tongue in cheek, that the park service people made a <br/>
spelling error (who spelled it "burned"), not him (who grammatically <br/>
preferred "burnt").   Hence, we have the BURNT Turkey Letterbox on the BURNED <br/>
Timber Loop.  :) Enjoy finding the letterbox below!  -Annette<br/>

BURNT TURKEY LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION:  Tin Can Camp, Taylor Creek Trail and Burned Timber Loop, Josephine <br/>
County, OR, near Grants Pass / Merlin.<br/>
DROPPED:  November 27, 2002, by the Horse Trap Gang.<br/>
PATH:  Dirt, foresty.  Significant elevation gain at first.  Evens out a bit <br/>
at the Burned Timber Loop.<br/>
EST. DISTANCE:  1.2 miles round-trip hike to the letterbox, 2.6 miles with <br/>
Burned Timber Loop tacked on.<br/>
CLUE DIFFICULTY:  Easy easy<br/>
<br/>
Thanksgiving Day 2002, the Horse Trap Gang dropped this box on the Burned <br/>
Timber Trail, hence Burnt Turkey Letterbox.  A pleasant drive to a scenic <br/>
hike that few people take is only 16 paved miles from I-5.<br/>
<br/>
(If you find any problems with this box or wish to share any successes, etc., <br/>
please email Annette at ARoseLb@aol.com.)<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS TO TRAILHEAD:  <br/>
Get off Interstate 5 at the Merlin Exit (No. 61, 3 miles north of Grants <br/>
Pass) and head west on Merlin-Garlice Road 11 miles (through the town of <br/>
Merlin, over Hellgate Canyon Bridge and past Indian Mary Park).  A mile after <br/>
the park you pass Morrisons Lodge on the right, and immediately on your left <br/>
appears Briggs Valley Road (aka Taylor Creek Road).<br/>
<br/>
Take that left and proceed 5 miles on this narrow, winding, beautiful road to <br/>
well-marked Tin Can Camp (just after Burned Timber Road veers to the left).  <br/>
The road has followed Taylor Creek, and on the other (i.e. southeast) side of <br/>
the creek a trail likewise parallels it.  Park your car. <br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
Cross the footbridge at Tin Can Camp.  Climb a short pitch to the <br/>
intersection with Taylor Creek Trail, then go left.  Follow Taylor Creek <br/>
Trail 1/2 mile, crossing Burned Timber Road and Burned Timber Creek (complete <br/>
with waterfall) in the process.  High above Taylor Creek you reach a junction <br/>
where the sign says it is another 3/4 mile to English Meadow on the main <br/>
trail.<br/>
<br/>
But you are going to switchback to the right, following the sign to Burned <br/>
Timber Trail.  100 yards after this junction sits the hollowed-out stump of a <br/>
long dead tree (burned, perhaps?).  The stump is four feet wide and right <br/>
next to the trail, on your left.  You don't need to leave the trail to find <br/>
the Burnt Turkey Letterboxit is in the hollow of the tree, at approximately <br/>
chest level (depending on how tall you are), covered by a piece of bark.<br/>
<br/>
The actual Burned Timber Loop Trail is still ahead.  Continue 100 yards after <br/>
the letterbox to cross Burned Timber Road again (you could actually drive <br/>
your car here, but there weren't any good landmarks to direct people when we <br/>
visited).  Soon after crossing the road, the trail forks.  Take either fork <br/>
and you will end up back here in 1.2 milesa nice little loop well worth the <br/>
additional effort.<br/>
