Subject: CT - abandoned boxes<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Woodchuck who let me know what was going on in the emails.<br/>
I've been on the trail for several years now but I had to stop the<br/>
emails back when SNET merged with Yahoo. After the merge there was no<br/>
way to stop the incoming emails for the summer. They were relentless!<br/>
They continued no matter what I did. Somehow the pref's were tangled<br/>
up and no one could get me out of the problem I found I was in. I<br/>
emailed webmasters and the like. I had first elected to not have<br/>
emails, then I quit, EVEN after quitting I still received emails<br/>
daily!<br/>
So, now I've decided to join again, but not for emails, I have<br/>
elected to to read them on the web.<br/>
I have let the webmaster know that I would like to claim my boxes,<br/>
"The Woodelves" Hampton, Windham County, CT  and "jurneez Crescent<br/>
Moon, Scotland, Windham County, CT.<br/>
BUT for those folks who do not receivve the daily Load of emails,<br/>
isn't it possible they don't know about the discussion of Abandoned<br/>
boxes and someone else adopting them?  Thank You anyway to Teach and<br/>
Preach for the concern.<br/>
Thank You Woodchuck for bringing this to my attention.<br/>
I will restock the boxes very soon!<br/>

We're encouraging everyone to try and trace and contact owners to let them<br/>
know about the changes and to help them register with the new website if<br/>
necessary, before worrying about adopting the boxes. Doing this has had a<br/>
high<br/>
success rate so far :-)<br/>

  "When I was a Girl in Martin Box" series--incredible<br/>
dialogue/description with  clues-based on a biographical novel<br/>
published by a Coventry resident. Book title is same as the letterbox<br/>
series. Stamps are lovely.  Box #2 is SOOO hard to retrieve without<br/>
being seen by passing cars. Mission accomplished, though.<br/>
  "Eternal Love" placed in the most restful spot one could imagine,<br/>
an ancient backroad cemetary. Touching story, perfect stamp.<br/>
  "John Wayne series"- I got such a kick out of this set of stamps<br/>
and clues.  Lots of fun trivia about the big guy's movies. I adored<br/>
True Grit as a high schooler.this series was the result of a<br/>
colaboration between Irishtinker the carver and Odilio &amp; Joisey Girl,<br/>
noe of who'm I've met as yet.   Teach and Preach were there the very<br/>
same day!  So sorry to have missed them.<br/>

A word to the wise, should you attempt this series of<br/>
letterboxes...<br/>
<br/>
The clue list metions this:<br/>
<br/>
"Find the place where rout 611 meets rout 412. Follow 412 north<br/>
to Stony Garden Rd and turn Rt. Look for # 1984 on the Rt. And<br/>
you will find the parking lot on the left."<br/>
<br/>
If you approach this site from 412, heading NORTH - Stony<br/>
Garden Road is on the LEFT, NOT the RIGHT! (or Rt., if that's<br/>
what was meant)<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, we found this clue set *fuzzy*, and while we<br/>
enjoyed the site, had to  give up the search as we simply saw<br/>
NOTHING that confirmed we were on the right track.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else found this set recently?<br/>
<br/>
(If these boxes *are* still there, they represent a greater<br/>
challenge than we were prepared for ... Time to move on to NJ<br/>
Boxes, it would seem.)<br/>

My daughter wants to carve a stamp and we printed one off the<br/>
computer and are using nail polish remover to transfer the design to<br/>
the eraser. The problem is its not working. Is there special kind of<br/>
paper that needs to be used?<br/>
<br/>
Also the only Staedtler erasers I could find were at Walmart. They<br/>
are the small erasers. What other types of materials does everyone<br/>
use? Where do you buy them? I have several stamps in mind to do, but<br/>
I need a bigger canvas. I also don't want to spend  a small fortune<br/>
on the blocks if you know what I mean.<br/>

Joisey Girl and I visited Thompson Park in Monroe Township NJ.   We found<br/>
the first two boxes with no problems.  We found the right spot for the third<br/>
box (we think) but there were people right there.  We skipped the last box<br/>
because we were very HOT!! and de4cided that all the hiking had earned us an<br/>
ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
We really liked the park and the trails!!<br/>

<br/>
Are you using a inkjet printer or a laser printer?  The inkjet printings do<br/>
not transfer as the laser ones do because the inkjet is ink and the laser<br/>
printers are based on toner.  More than likely, I'd suspect you are using an<br/>
inkjet printer and that's why it's not working.<br/>
<br/>
So, what you do is this (If you don't have a laser printer. [I myself have<br/>
an old LaserJet III with a 90 dollar toner cartridge and all!]):<br/>
<br/>
Print the image using the inkjet and then trace over it with a dark #2<br/>
pencil, then transfer by using a coin or something like that. That will<br/>
cause the graphite of the pencil lead to transfer off the image and onto the<br/>
carving medium.<br/>

The Yachats 804 letterbox is still there, acc. to a recent visitor,<br/>
but it is empty! Is there anyone who visits Yachats in the summer or<br/>
early fall who could replenish the box if we were to send a new stamp<br/>
and notebook?<br/>

&gt; Are you using a inkjet printer or a laser printer?  The inkjet<br/>

---<br/>
Well, that explains why I can't get the image to transfer, after<br/>
gassing myself all night with acetone. Well, not really, I am careful<br/>
*grin* I want to keep as many brain cells as possible.)  I just gently<br/>
rub the back of the tracing with my finger while holding it secure and<br/>
this is enough to transfer the image.  Then I ink over the image that<br/>
is now on the carving material with a black ink pen like a fine point<br/>
uni-ball which is waterproof &amp; fadeproof.  Now the image stays put as<br/>
I carve the stamp. When I cut, I use a speedball #1 blade without<br/>
putting it in the holder, this gives me complete control.  I'm very<br/>
nearsighted so I can see closeup w/o my glasses, some people get the<br/>
same results with a magnifyer. First I carve the hard part. Then carve<br/>
around all the design, after that I take out the big empty spaces with<br/>
either a speedball #5 "U" shaped blade or a speedball #2 "V"shaped<br/>
blade. The edges are the last to go &amp; are done just before mounting on<br/>
acrylic. During the process I check how the stamp looks with a stamp<br/>
pad that has ink that washes off. My first stamps were on erasers,<br/>
I've heard the mars stadtler is good, I don't remember what I used but<br/>
I do remember I went thru several because of mistakes - do expect it.<br/>
 You can buy the speedball blades at crafts stores like Michaels for<br/>
about $3-4 a pkg of 2-3 but look carefully at the condition of the<br/>
blades inside: some might be rusting or bent or mis-shaped ("they"<br/>
just don't make them the way they use to I guess).  I always sharpen<br/>
my speedball blades before each carving but I'm fussy and it's<br/>
probably not needed for a first time carver.  Michaels also sells<br/>
small sketch books for about $4.00 and Wal-mart has Rubbermaid<br/>
containers for $2-3.00.<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

One more thing, I like the dye based ink pads Michaels sells for $2.00<br/>
here in Syracuse. Shake the pad first though, if it rattles then the<br/>
pad has come loose &amp; in my experience it's almost dry.<br/>

Mystery boxes are a wonderful thing in my opinion... I've building two now<br/>
as a matter of fact, place a Doggone series and a Misplaced Salmon Migration<br/>
series.<br/>
<br/>
As far as where to start on the mystery boxes, I'm assuming you are talking<br/>
of the clues?  If so, take a look at the way that the current mystery boxes<br/>
are done to get some examples.  That's the best way I can tell you.<br/>

My sister and I and our kids visited the box on Sunday anyway.<br/>
Other than the missing stamp and missing ink pad, it's in good<br/>
condition.  LOTS of people have been there, despite the missing<br/>
stamp.  I drew a covered bridge in my logbook and my sister's so we<br/>
could have something to show we'd been there  :)<br/>
I'm not sure where you are, but I live in northeastern CT and if you<br/>
want to meet somewhere this week, I could bring the stamp to the box<br/>
this weekend.  Email me if you're interested -<br/>

I'm sitting here working on my log book, and was wondering how<br/>
everyone else organizes their log books. I have printed out the who,<br/>
what, when and where of the stamps I have as well as the found date<br/>
then I cut them out and glue them into the book beside the stamp. If<br/>
it's a park and the park had a map, I am gluing that on the oposite<br/>
side of those stamps. I keep my series together, hitch hikers<br/>
together, etc. I even have a page just for our personal stamps, and<br/>
plan to make a place for ones we place as well.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else organize their books? How? Or are you just a random<br/>
stamper?<br/>
<br/>
Curious mind want to know!<br/>

Cute but right Mark, Litchfield County, CT<br/>
<br/>
No matter how I put the clues together it turns out too easy, there needs to<br/>
be some brain activity, even just a little.  Example: the shape -- right to<br/>
the sight, the Name - of course, The City - first site, again, Why it was<br/>
placed<br/>
there -- first again, just the picture -- no Mystery to that. So what next?<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

Hey, if all else fails I can turn it into regular box.<br/>
