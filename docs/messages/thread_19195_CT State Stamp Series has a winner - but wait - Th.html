<br/>
Wanda Miner is the winning letterboxer to first complete this 8<br/>
county series and we offer her our congratulations for her effort!<br/>
<br/>
In an effort to keep this quest interesting, The Engraver has<br/>
suggested that we give you other boxers 1 year to complete this<br/>
series from today - 6/15/2005, after which a drawing will be held<br/>
from all of the eligible boxers who have completed this series for 10<br/>
personalized gifts.<br/>
<br/>
"So 10 lucky letterboxers out of all who finish will get a<br/>
personalized gift from The Engraver!" [Thank you, Don Pardo]<br/>
<br/>
I thought we would end this fun series [not that it hasn't hit a few<br/>
bumps in the road!! - HH!!] with - what else - a gathering. Look for<br/>
details to come for the CT Stamp Series Gathering to take place some<br/>
time next summer.<br/>
<br/>
Until then, get all 8 stamps, email me with your scanned images, or<br/>
email me for our snail mail address. And if you complete the series,<br/>
your name will be added to the CT Stamp Series Hall of Fame page<br/>
located on our webpage.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! [and complete the CT series!]<br/>
<br/>
Mark &amp; Sue Pepe, along with The Engraver<br/>

Congratulations to Wanda, Woo Hoo !!!!<br/>
<br/>
It is my hope that everyone will continue to complete this series, <br/>
then join us next year at a Gathering where 10 lucky boxers will win <br/>
personalized gifts.<br/>
<br/>
Send your images of the completed 8 county stamps of CT to Mark &amp; Sue <br/>
along with your personal trail stamp, the date you finished it and <br/>
what county it was. <br/>
<br/>
Many many thanks to Mark &amp; Sue for their efforts in making this <br/>
possiable, minus the few bumps, ha ha :-)<br/>
