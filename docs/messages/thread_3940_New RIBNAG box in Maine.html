This one bears the name "Prentiss Apprentice", and<br/>
we have written the clue as a very easy mystery box:<br/>
<br/>
http://users.tmok.com/~ribnag/lb-prentiss.shtml<br/>
<br/>
For those who have not yet read or seen Harry Potter,<br/>
the clue makes vague references to it, but does not<br/>
bluntly give anything away.  For those who have written<br/>
Harry Potter based clues, read this clue before you<br/>
suspect us of copying your style, you'll get a kick<br/>
out of it.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, we mention this with every clue post, but we<br/>
still get box status reports for boxes that our main<br/>
page very clearly indicates as "missing".  *PLEASE*<br/>
check our main page for the status of any box you<br/>
plan to go after, *before* looking for it.  We don't<br/>
really care about getting redundant reports, deleting<br/>
them takes very little effort.  By not checking,<br/>
however, you waste quite a lot more of your own<br/>
ime than ours.  Go here:<br/>
