<br/>
#2, #3 and #4 made it to their first destinations and are already <br/>
moving toward their second stops. However, #3 arrived in damaged <br/>
condition and had to be repackaged. Please feel free to repackage <br/>
these postal travellers however seems prudent, when you send them <br/>
on. Apparently two of the containers were not as sturdy as I thought.<br/>
<br/>
So far, #1 has yet to arrive at the first destination, so that is <br/>
worrisome. If it fails to arrive after another week, I will recarve <br/>
the stamp and make a new letterbox 'ensemble' and start it on the <br/>
journey again. <br/>
