                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tom and I just got home from a long weekend in Southern Maine.  We  found 12 <br/>
boxes, 3 hitchhikers, and left one new hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
We also met Nautilus at the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve -  <br/>
Laudholm Farm.  She didn't have her stamp with her to do an exchange   :-( but it <br/>
was fun to chat a little (and she had a copy of a mystery box clue  that we <br/>
didn't have, so were able to get 2 extra boxes right there - the mystery  and a <br/>
bonus box)!!<br/>
<br/>
We started out on Friday at the Wells Transportation Hitchhiker Hostel -  <br/>
LOVE the stamp with the bonus stamp on the end - very cool.  We left our  new <br/>
"Eye Heart U" HH and "Help, Please Murder - V" HH.  We took "Patty" one  of <br/>
TeamGreenDragon's fugitive hh's.  We transported Patty across  many state lines <br/>
without getting caught and will release her shortly  somewhere in Connecticut.<br/>
<br/>
Then it was onto Wells Reserve at Laudholm Farm where we just about got  <br/>
carried across the trails by mosquitos!!  We found "Norway Maple," "Great  Blue <br/>
Heron," "Actius Luna," the mystery box, and the Gazebo bonus box.   Thanks <br/>
Nautiuls, Culex and Phyto for these great boxes!<br/>
<br/>
We did some wandering around Kennebunk and found "Saints Abound."   We've <br/>
never seen a ginko tree in person before!  <br/>
<br/>
We found the Mystery box on Route 99.  Tom was wishing we had  brought his <br/>
4WD Jeep, but my little ole Taurus made it down the road just  fine.  I got a <br/>
little anxious crossing the causeway by way of rocks in the  middle of the <br/>
water, but we made it safe and dry!!  Even found the "Green  Fox" bonus box.  Is <br/>
there really such a thing as a green fox?!?!<br/>
<br/>
On Saturday we got some "Higher Education" in Biddeford.  We also got  2 <br/>
hitchhikers - one brand spankin' new one by Phyto, "Physics in a can."   Mark and <br/>
Sue Pepe's "Dead Duck HH" is back in Connecticut after traveling  through the <br/>
other New England states, and will be placed sometime soon!<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure those of you familiar with Maine will think this is hysterical,  but <br/>
we had the directions for the "Wood Island Light" box printed up.  We  drove <br/>
around and tried to get directions to the light, finally finding someone  who <br/>
told us how to get to the viewing point.  Guess the only way we'll get  that <br/>
box is by boat - and that wasn't happening this trip.  We did get some  <br/>
beautiful views of the lighthouse from the overlook!!<br/>
<br/>
Today we began to meandering South.  We found "Mt. A" in  York.  The only <br/>
concern is that the directions should be in paces, not  steps.  But we don't give <br/>
up easily and were able to find it!  We also  went to Ft. McClary for the 2nd <br/>
time and successfully found "Seahorse."  We  swore we looked there last <br/>
time!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who took the time to plant these great boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Suz (and Tom)<br/>

Even funnier is that there are 2 boxes right where you were....BIRD WALK and BEACH <br/>
ROSE - on the only little spit of land that lets you view Wood Island light. You've gotta <br/>
paddle to that one on the island. I do have a series planned for the seacoast that <br/>
includes a detailed stamp design of this lighthouse, but it won't be done for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad you guys missed those other boxes...and the Painterly Day at the Wells <br/>
Reserve today - you could have seen PHYTO in action!!<br/>
<br/>
Next time!<br/>
