<br/>
I'm hoping to get some help from y'all with regard to planting a <br/>
letterbox near Pemaquid Point.<br/>
<br/>
My family is gathering up there in mid-October to commit my <br/>
grandmother's ashes to the deep off the Point. We did the same thing <br/>
with my grandfathers ashes 18 years ago and it was her wish to join <br/>
him there when the time came. Granny spent most of her summers in <br/>
Maine as a young girl so it always had special meaning to her. My <br/>
grandparents used to spend 2 weeks in the spring and another 2 in <br/>
the fall in that area every year. It is my hope to plant a letterbox <br/>
in memory of my grandparents near the place that held such a special <br/>
place in their hearts.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm a fairly new letterboxer and this will be the first one <br/>
I plant. I was wondering how to find out if the Pemaquid Point <br/>
lighthouse facilities would be open to the idea of planting a <br/>
letterbox on the property, or if anyone up there is familiar with <br/>
the area and has a better idea. At this point, I'm wide open to <br/>
suggestions and advice.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Lois, <br/>
My suggestion would be to contact the president of the Friends of<br/>
Pemaquid Point Lighthouse. Here's his contact info:<br/>
Marty Welt at (207) 563-2739, or email backlog@tidewater.net<br/>
HOWEVER, if you check the LBNA clue database, you will see that there<br/>
is already another box at that location (The Angel Gabriel) and it is<br/>
usually considered in bad taste to plant a box so close to another<br/>
person's without contacting them first. The box and stamp image are<br/>
quite lovely and might fit well with what you had in mind. Perhaps you<br/>
might want to approach the planters about putting a bonus clue inside<br/>
their box leading to another in an area nearby? I would definitely get<br/>
in touch with them before the Friends of Pemaquid Lighthouse since I<br/>
have no idea whether or not they asked permission to plant their box<br/>
and you wouldn't want to put it in jeopardy.<br/>
My condolences about your grandmother, but it sounds like a lovely way<br/>
to remember her.<br/>
