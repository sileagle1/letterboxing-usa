Since we're always looking for ways to act discreet- here's an idea. <br/>
We found a box today with this written in the logbook "We were <br/>
hunting for mushrooms when we found this. Cool. What is <br/>
letterboxing?" <br/>
<br/>
Maybe by now the writers have found this site. But mushroom hunting <br/>
sounds like a good cover story. Except, is it seasonal? Is it <br/>
plausible to be looking for mushrooms in January in the Midwest, for <br/>
example?<br/>
