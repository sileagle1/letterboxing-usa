                    <div class="plaintext-content">To find the Cape D'Or letterbox near East Advocate take Rte 209 from <br/>
Parrsboro along the shore road to East Advocate. Turn onto the Cape <br/>
D'Or road , a gravel road, and proceed for 3 miles following signs. <br/>
When at the end of the road, park in the lot provided for visitors <br/>
that is at the top of the Cape. Take the trail that begins at the <br/>
front of the lighthouse/ visitor center at the edge of the parking <br/>
lot. This is not the  true lighthouse . The working lighthouse is at <br/>
the foot of the steep hill closer to the waters edge. <br/>
   Follow the the gravel trail around the headland of the Cape, <br/>
crossing three small wooden footbridges. The letterbox is 22 feet <br/>
from the third bridge, beneath a leaning spruce tree , 8 feet from <br/>
the path.  When you look out over the sea here you are witness to <br/>
some of the worst riptides known. Sailors beware the trusty light to <br/>
see you through. Stamp secretly and enjoy Nova Scotia. <br/>
