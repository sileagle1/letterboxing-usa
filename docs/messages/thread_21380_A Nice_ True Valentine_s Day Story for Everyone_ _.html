Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I had originally posted this on the Letterboxing-SOcal Yahoo group <br/>
message board, and upon Don's recommendation, I am posting it again <br/>
here...<br/>
<br/>
Allow me to tell you about my love for letterboxing or in this<br/>
case, <br/>
letterboxing for my love (this sounds so cryptic, but it will all <br/>
become very clear to you by the end of this story). <br/>
<br/>
Last Friday, 2/11, I got a message through the LbNA website from a <br/>
new letterboxer named "StevieFranklin2005" in regards to my<br/>
Wooly's <br/>
LB. The message was as follows: <br/>
<br/>
"If I find your Wooly Letterbox on Saturday (2/12/2005), I will<br/>
place <br/>
a hitchhiker stamp in it! I hope I understand your clues. PLEASE look <br/>
for my stamp on Sunday; I am quite proud of it." <br/>
<br/>
I haven't been doing this LB'ing thing for very long, but the<br/>
email <br/>
did seem to be a little outside of conventional LB'ing protocol.<br/>
I've <br/>
always viewed HH's as little surprises, and here this guy was, <br/>
declaring to me that upon the discovery of one of my boxes, he was <br/>
going to triumphantly plant a HH there to show his conquest. I was a <br/>
little amused by the fact that this person was so enthusiastic about <br/>
planting a HH, he absolutely HAD to tell me about it and ruin the <br/>
surprise. I attributed this behavior to the possibility that he was <br/>
so new at this that he didn't know any better.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I emailed him back and told him that I was sure it looked <br/>
very nice and that I looked forward to seeing it. <br/>
<br/>
I told my boyfriend about it that night, and we both chuckled. My <br/>
boyfriend is not as interested in LB'ing as I am. He doesn't<br/>
care <br/>
much for carving stamps and hiding them, but he does enjoy finding <br/>
the stamps with me, as well as the places it takes us to. He <br/>
suggested that we should check it out when we had a chance. Seeing <br/>
that he actually was up for some minor letterboxing, how could I <br/>
refuse? <br/>
<br/>
So Sunday, 2/13 rolled around. Since it was Valentine's Day<br/>
weekend, <br/>
he had made dinner reservations for us at a nice local restaurant for <br/>
7:30. We had spent that morning running a 5K in Chinatown, and then <br/>
afterward stayed there for the Chinese New Year festivities. By the <br/>
time we got home in the afternoon, we were bushed, so we took a nap, <br/>
and he woke us up at around 6PM and said we should get ready to go <br/>
out. Now, my boyfriend is typically not a very punctual person, so I <br/>
was impressed that he wanted to get up a little earlier so we would <br/>
have some time to go look for the HH and still make it to the <br/>
restaurant in time. I figured he thought I would enjoy stamping the <br/>
HH in my logbook. <br/>
<br/>
It was pretty much dark when we got to Wooly's hiding spot.<br/>
I'd never <br/>
really been there at night, and was surprised to find that the <br/>
location is pretty well lit, with a warm yellowish light emanating <br/>
from the streetlight. We retrieved the box and I sat on a bench and <br/>
opened it. I saw the HH wrapped in a napkin sitting in a little <br/>
baggie. The first thing I noticed was that the HH didn't have its<br/>
own <br/>
logbook. I looked in my Wooly's logbook and saw that C-Bear and<br/>
Koko <br/>
had been there that day and stamped in, but no HH imprint!! I <br/>
couldn't help but think that StevieFranklin2005 definitely was<br/>
new at <br/>
this, and that he should have at least looked up how to create a HH <br/>
somewhere online. "Well, I'll just look at the stamp itself,<br/>
then," I <br/>
thought to myself. I took it out of the bag and unwrapped it. It <br/>
wasn't as impressive as StevieFranklin2005 had described it to<br/>
be. It <br/>
only had a few words and some hearts carved into it. I kind of <br/>
figured out what the words said and found that it was a<br/>
Valentine's <br/>
Day themed HH!! I was beginning to think what an interesting idea it <br/>
was to place a themed HH in my box, when I heard my boyfriend ask <br/>
me, "So what does it say?" I looked up and saw him busily<br/>
kneeling <br/>
down tying his shoe.  <br/>
<br/>
"It's funny," I said, "It says `Will You Marry<br/>
Me?'" <br/>
<br/>
"Well, will you?" <br/>
<br/>
I looked up at him again, somewhat confused. There he was, kneeling <br/>
in front of me, with a little box in his hands. I was totally <br/>
floored!!! The ring was beautiful! And OF COURSE I SAID YES!!! <br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is, as my mind was swimming around in all the <br/>
excitement, I was still confused, and wondered where <br/>
StevieFranklin2005's HH was. In case you hadn't figured it<br/>
out by now <br/>
(like me), it turned out my boyfriend, now "fiance," had<br/>
made it all <br/>
up!! I had no idea he could be so creative. <br/>
<br/>
Today I got an email from C-Bear and Koko telling me they had found <br/>
my box and that there was a personal stamp in there for me. I found <br/>
that hilarious! Thanks to the two of you for not having mistaken the <br/>
stamp for a real HH, and for contributing to the best moment of my <br/>
life!!! <br/>
<br/>
I have always been appreciative of the places that LB'ing has<br/>
taken <br/>
me to, but never did I imagine that it would take me here!!! <br/>
<br/>
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY EVERYONE!!!!! <br/>
<br/>

  figured out what the words said and found that it was a<br/>
  Valentine's <br/>
  Day themed HH!! I was beginning to think what an interesting idea it <br/>
  was to place a themed HH in my box, when I heard my boyfriend ask <br/>
  me, "So what does it say?" I looked up and saw him busily<br/>
  kneeling <br/>
  down tying his shoe.  <br/>
<br/>
  "It's funny," I said, "It says `Will You Marry<br/>
  Me?'" <br/>
<br/>
  "Well, will you?" <br/>
<br/>
  I looked up at him again, somewhat confused. There he was, kneeling <br/>
  in front of me, with a little box in his hands. I was totally <br/>
  floored!!! The ring was beautiful! And OF COURSE I SAID YES!!! <br/>
<br/>
  The funny thing is, as my mind was swimming around in all the <br/>
  excitement, I was still confused, and wondered where <br/>
  StevieFranklin2005's HH was. In case you hadn't figured it<br/>
  out by now <br/>
  (like me), it turned out my boyfriend, now "fiance," had<br/>
  made it all <br/>
  up!! I had no idea he could be so creative. <br/>
<br/>
  Today I got an email from C-Bear and Koko telling me they had found <br/>
  my box and that there was a personal stamp in there for me. I found <br/>
  that hilarious! Thanks to the two of you for not having mistaken the <br/>
  stamp for a real HH, and for contributing to the best moment of my <br/>
  life!!! <br/>
<br/>
  I have always been appreciative of the places that LB'ing has<br/>
  taken <br/>
  me to, but never did I imagine that it would take me here!!! <br/>
<br/>
  HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY EVERYONE!!!!! <br/>

  I just wish I had of known about LBing back when I asked my wife.... it has been 12 years since I asked my wife to marry me on VD... but I have yet to regret it.  A little secret to staying married... dont go to bed mad... EVER... if it takes all night to sort out the problem it takes all night... It really does work!<br/>
<br/>
  -Wilson<br/>
<br/>
  I will agree Wilson...and also remember that unless you married a physic, Husbands/Wives can not read your mind!<br/>

Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I had originally posted this on the Letterboxing-SOcal Yahoo group <br/>
message board, and upon Don's recommendation, I am posting it again <br/>
here...<br/>
<br/>
Allow me to tell you about my love for letterboxing or in this<br/>
case, <br/>
letterboxing for my love (this sounds so cryptic, but it will all <br/>
become very clear to you by the end of this story). <br/>
<br/>
Last Friday, 2/11, I got a message through the LbNA website from a <br/>
new letterboxer named "StevieFranklin2005" in regards to my<br/>
Wooly's <br/>
LB. The message was as follows: <br/>
<br/>
"If I find your Wooly Letterbox on Saturday (2/12/2005), I will<br/>
place <br/>
a hitchhiker stamp in it! I hope I understand your clues. PLEASE look <br/>
for my stamp on Sunday; I am quite proud of it." <br/>
<br/>
I haven't been doing this LB'ing thing for very long, but the<br/>
email <br/>
did seem to be a little outside of conventional LB'ing protocol.<br/>
I've <br/>
always viewed HH's as little surprises, and here this guy was, <br/>
declaring to me that upon the discovery of one of my boxes, he was <br/>
going to triumphantly plant a HH there to show his conquest. I was a <br/>
little amused by the fact that this person was so enthusiastic about <br/>
planting a HH, he absolutely HAD to tell me about it and ruin the <br/>
surprise. I attributed this behavior to the possibility that he was <br/>
so new at this that he didn't know any better.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I emailed him back and told him that I was sure it looked <br/>
very nice and that I looked forward to seeing it. <br/>
<br/>
I told my boyfriend about it that night, and we both chuckled. My <br/>
boyfriend is not as interested in LB'ing as I am. He doesn't<br/>
care <br/>
much for carving stamps and hiding them, but he does enjoy finding <br/>
the stamps with me, as well as the places it takes us to. He <br/>
suggested that we should check it out when we had a chance. Seeing <br/>
that he actually was up for some minor letterboxing, how could I <br/>
refuse? <br/>
<br/>
So Sunday, 2/13 rolled around. Since it was Valentine's Day<br/>
weekend, <br/>
he had made dinner reservations for us at a nice local restaurant for <br/>
7:30. We had spent that morning running a 5K in Chinatown, and then <br/>
afterward stayed there for the Chinese New Year festivities. By the <br/>
time we got home in the afternoon, we were bushed, so we took a nap, <br/>
and he woke us up at around 6PM and said we should get ready to go <br/>
out. Now, my boyfriend is typically not a very punctual person, so I <br/>
was impressed that he wanted to get up a little earlier so we would <br/>
have some time to go look for the HH and still make it to the <br/>
restaurant in time. I figured he thought I would enjoy stamping the <br/>
HH in my logbook. <br/>
<br/>
It was pretty much dark when we got to Wooly's hiding spot.<br/>
I'd never <br/>
really been there at night, and was surprised to find that the <br/>
location is pretty well lit, with a warm yellowish light emanating <br/>
from the streetlight. We retrieved the box and I sat on a bench and <br/>
opened it. I saw the HH wrapped in a napkin sitting in a little <br/>
baggie. The first thing I noticed was that the HH didn't have its<br/>
own <br/>
logbook. I looked in my Wooly's logbook and saw that C-Bear and<br/>
Koko <br/>
had been there that day and stamped in, but no HH imprint!! I <br/>
couldn't help but think that StevieFranklin2005 definitely was<br/>
new at <br/>
this, and that he should have at least looked up how to create a HH <br/>
somewhere online. "Well, I'll just look at the stamp itself,<br/>
then," I <br/>
thought to myself. I took it out of the bag and unwrapped it. It <br/>
wasn't as impressive as StevieFranklin2005 had described it to<br/>
be. It <br/>
only had a few words and some hearts carved into it. I kind of <br/>
figured out what the words said and found that it was a<br/>
Valentine's <br/>
Day themed HH!! I was beginning to think what an interesting idea it <br/>
was to place a themed HH in my box, when I heard my boyfriend ask <br/>
me, "So what does it say?" I looked up and saw him busily<br/>
kneeling <br/>
down tying his shoe.  <br/>
<br/>
"It's funny," I said, "It says `Will You Marry<br/>
Me?'" <br/>
<br/>
"Well, will you?" <br/>
<br/>
I looked up at him again, somewhat confused. There he was, kneeling <br/>
in front of me, with a little box in his hands. I was totally <br/>
floored!!! The ring was beautiful! And OF COURSE I SAID YES!!! <br/>

made it all <br/>

<br/>
