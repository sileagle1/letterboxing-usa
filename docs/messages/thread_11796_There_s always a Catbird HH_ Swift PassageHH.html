Amy and I did some letterboxing today in Mansfield, and we got <br/>
several series that we have been meaning to get to.  All of which <br/>
were in execlent shape. Sooo I wouldn't bore you with which ones.  <br/>
However of note we did pick-up the "There's always a Catbird" HH <br/>
at "In Search of Caddy" and will be moveing it along after the snow. <br/>
(It's April.....why is there snow falling outside my window?)  Our <br/>
trip was cut short by the snow.  <br/>
<br/>
We placed in our journey's today the "Swift Passage" HH at one of the <br/>
boxes we visited.  So it can continue it's journey.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you haven't been to any of Chuck and Molly's "In Search of" <br/>
series, We can't recomend them high enough.  The stamps are <br/>
wonderful, and the walks are just great.  Have a safe and good day.<br/>
<br/>
Patrick and Amy<br/>
