The Marthas are already going, and when they return to me, that is <br/>
the end, but I know there are a few more in the works, that are <br/>
coming up very soon. These tend to be more popular in the winter, I <br/>
think, when many letterboxers up north can't really go letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing! (both 'real' and postal) ;)<br/>

I'd like to share something.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I placed the Aztec Gold into the mail to ship it across to the<br/>
first recipient.  This is what the post office charge and what they would<br/>
have charged:<br/>
<br/>
Express Mail        (Overnight)        $21.05<br/>
Priority Mail        (2 Days)            $8.55<br/>
Parcel Post            (8 days)        $6.32<br/>
<br/>
Delivery Confirmation = .45<br/>
<br/>
I sent it Priority Mail, with delivery confirmation for a grand total of<br/>
$9.00.  Now, what does my nine bucks get me? Nothing.  I can't track it,<br/>
only Express Mail can be tracked and I wasn't going to pay $21.00 to do<br/>
that. All I get is delivery confirmation and, although that's helpful, I<br/>
want to know where it is, where it's going, where it's help up at, etc, etc.<br/>
Now, checking the UPS website:<br/>
<br/>
UPS 2nd Day            (2 Business Days)                    $14.57<br/>
UPS 3 Day Select    (3 Business Days)                    $12.33<br/>
UPS Ground                (5 business Days)                 $8.07<br/>
<br/>
5 Business days and eight dollars and I get to track it all the way on it's<br/>
journey.  And, since I am anal about things like this, for me, in the<br/>
future, I'll be using UPS.<br/>
<br/>
And, speaking of the Aztec Gold Postal Letterbox, feel free, everyone, to<br/>
stop by and take a look at it's travels at:<br/>

you do this - and print your labels online, your cost per package is<br/>
slightly less.<br/>
<br/>
Or, if you use PayPal - you can make and print UPS labels there.  Since<br/>
PayPal has so many subscribers, the rates for UPS are pretty reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
I own my own business and I am always looking for the cheaest and<br/>
fastest ways to send packages.  Most of the time (not always), USPS is<br/>
cheaper under 5 pounds.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway - hope this information helps all of you who mail packages<br/>
(including Postal LB's)!  It always amazes me how mailing stuff has<br/>
gotten soooo expensive!  We live in CO and have family in FL and CA -<br/>
holidays and birthdays cost us a fortune!  <br/>

But when a PLB list closes - it is between the lister and the listees <br/>
to keep a line of communication either directly or on the list posts.<br/>
<br/>
Did that help? (N.B. - that does not count as a question.)<br/>
<br/>
In fact all you folks looking for local yahoo groups, just click <br/>
on "Groups Home" in the upper right corner and in the next screen, <br/>
Search field type letterboxing / amazing how many folks are out there <br/>
talking.<br/>
