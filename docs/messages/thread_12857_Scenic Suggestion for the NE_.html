  What we letterbox, my husband mainly goes along for the walk and to <br/>
indulge his photo hobby. <br/>
   In hopes of getting to do more boxing... I would enjoy hearing <br/>
folks suggestions as to letterboxes placed in especially lovely, <br/>
scenic nature areas with good photo potential. Preferably within 2 <br/>

<br/>
   If you were into photography, which letterboxes would you <br/>
especially want to visit?  <br/>

P.S. Next I'll probably be looking for letterboxes near good ice <br/>
cream so I can get the daughter interested LOL   <br/>

<br/>
Although we haven't made it out to the eastern part of<br/>
Massachusetts yet, I think that more boxes in the Blue<br/>
Hills south of Boston would be a good thing. Great<br/>
views of the city from the tops of those hills. <br/>
<br/>
I also bet that just about any box placed on the Cape<br/>
Cod shoreline would be considered scenic. That's<br/>
another area on our list of places to go.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel like coming out towards western Mass, one<br/>
of our boxes is in one of the most scenic places in<br/>
this area, The Kerr Clan box, at Chesterfield Gorge.<br/>
It's slightly more than a two hour drive, but then you<br/>
could spend the day here and nab a lot of boxes very<br/>
fast.<br/>

both of landscapes and animals (birds especially).  CLose to your 2 <br/>
hour limit though... and you could probably spend 2-3 full days in <br/>
Rocky!  There's tons of boxes in the Killingly and Mansfield area <br/>
with good ice cream nearby (grin) but I have not been to any so I <br/>
can't comment on their scenic beauty.<br/>
