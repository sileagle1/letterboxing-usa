&gt;  Thanks Daniel for sending the container. I'm going to carve and<br/>
&gt;  stamp, and see if I can fit all the necessary goodies into the jar.<br/>
&gt;  It seems a bit small, but perhaps I need to think smaller!<br/>
<br/>
Well, maybe its not the right one.  I've checked on some more<br/>
containers and found that they come in polystyrene, polypropylene,<br/>
and polyethylene.  They come in clear, opaque and translucent with<br/>
metal or plastic lids with varying threads.  Some have a neck-down<br/>
at the opening, some do not.  The ones that I think would be usable<br/>
for letterboxing vary in size from 3 1/8 X 4" through 5 1/16 X 4 3/8".<br/>
Some materials are more durable than others.  I'm going to check<br/>
further into it.  Oh, BTW prices are from about 50 cents to 107 cents<br/>
depending on size.  The 5 1/16 X 4 3/8" container is 107 cents (sorry<br/>
Graham, guess you will not be interested cuz they're more than<br/>
50 cents! <g> ).  Anyway, somebody should try a few of these and see<br/>
if any of them get good reviews.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I received a waterproof pad from Write in the Rain. When I stamped<br/>
&gt;  on the paper, the ink seemed to not want to dry and got really<br/>
&gt;  smudgy. Has anyone else had this problem? Maybe its the type of<br/>
&gt;  inkpad I'm using.<br/>
<br/>
I've had that happen on ordinary paper, but I'd be interested in <br/>
knowing if there is something peculiar to the treatment on Rite in<br/>
the Rain paper that causes this.  If so, we are probably barking up<br/>
the wrong tree and would be better off to concentrate on well sealing<br/>
containers and ziplock bags.  BTW, I think the degrading ziplock bag<br/>
someone spoke of probably was years old.  I don't see one of those<br/>
going bad in a shorter period of time than that.  They have unearthed<br/>
those styrofoam McDonald's hamburger containers that have been in<br/>
the ground for 15 years and they are still intact. <br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Daniel, if the jar works out, would you be interested in selling<br/>
&gt;  a few to me?<br/>
<br/>
I'll give 'em to ya if its not more than about half a dozen.  I like<br/>
ya'll, so that holds true for anyone else out there who wants to try <br/>
these.  I have about 70 of them left.  I plan to get some other<br/>
containers and try them too, so at the time some of you may want to<br/>
inquire.  I'm thinking of ordering a bunch of the larger size that<br/>
both Erik and Graham suggested may be best.  I think there is a <br/>
benefit to a circular screw on lid in that there is less chance of<br/>
breaking the seal due to pressure against the lid and the fact that<br/>
the perimeter is less (thus less opportunity of a place for the seal<br/>
to be broken).  Though rubbermaid is what I used on my first letter-<br/>
box which BTW I have not checked since last Aug. when I placed it.<br/>

I'm guessing it's not organic material. The pulp<br/>
is probably nylon or some other sort of plastic<br/>
that's hot pressed. If that's the case, water based<br/>
inks may not ever adhere to it. <br/>

Actually, no. A few months. But the ones I <br/>
use are thinner ply than the regular food-storage<br/>
ziplocks. I store glass beads in them, and they<br/>
decompose within a couple of months. That <br/>
MAY have something to do with the glass... and<br/>
some glass beads are surface treated with acid<br/>
to etch them, so that may also be the problem.<br/>
In any case, they are used continually over that<br/>
period, so handling may also contribute to the<br/>
rate of decomposition. I'll do some field testing<br/>
and report back.<br/>

It appears to be just like regular paper. My vote is that it is coated. <br/>
Since the coating is designed to repel water, water based ink will not<br/>
adhere.  That, after all, is its job!!<br/>

<br/>
I tried out the Rite in the Rain paper as well, using a standard Carters stamp<br/>
pad from an office supply store.  I also found that the ink smears much worse<br/>
than on regular paper, even hours after the imprint has been made.<br/>
<br/>
Though its not this bad, Dan mentions that ordinary paper has a tendency to<br/>
smear, also.  I thought this was as good a time as any to put in a plug for my<br/>
favorite pad to use for a log book.  Erik Davis recommended Strathmore Sketch<br/>
pads to me long ago, and I love them.  They come in a 3 1/2 x 5 inch size<br/>
(another company also makes a 3" x 5" book) that fits nicely in a Rubbermaid<br/>
container.  It is nice heavy (50 lb.) paper.  And with 100 sheets per pad, it<br/>
should last a long time.  Whether you get the regular or recycled pads, the<br/>
paper has no annoying rule lines on it, and has a nice absorbent "tooth" to it<br/>
that accepts ink rapidly and reduces smearing.  I get them at my nearby<br/>
Michael's craft store for under 3 bucks.<br/>
<br/>
In one particular instance, a youngster visited one of my letterboxes during<br/>
the local rainy season, and failed to put the book back in the ziplock bag I<br/>
had provided.  They also failed to reseal the Rubbermaid container properly.<br/>
It was in a covered area, so did not get soaked, but was exposed to high<br/>
humidity for well over a week before I checked on it.  I'm not saying this<br/>
stuff is waterproof, by any means, but it recovered quickly without wrinkling<br/>
or having the pages stick together.  The ink did not smear, either.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody also mentioned the idea of putting ink pads in the box.  I've heard<br/>
that in the case of accidental water intake, this can make one hell of a mess.<br/>
<br/>
Just some observations...<br/>

This is the pad I also have been using both as my personal pad and in the boxes.  I like it as much as Mitch.  Would highly recommend it, although it is a bit more expensive (I've found it for less than $2.50).<br/>
