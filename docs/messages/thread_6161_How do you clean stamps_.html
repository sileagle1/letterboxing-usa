<br/>
We're still rather new at this, but based on recommendations from this list we<br/>
carry a few wet (not dripping) paper towels in a ziploc with us.  All <br/>
stamps found to date have been in need of a good cleaning, which we've done <br/>
before and after use.  This works fine for dye based inks, which is all <br/>
we've encountered so far.  Baby wipes, or something with a soap in it, is <br/>
probably needed for pigment inks, which are a bit oily (or something that <br/>
makes them thicker and slicker) and therefore harder to remove from <br/>
stamps.  At home, where I rubber stamp a lot, I use a toothbrush and dish <br/>
soap to remove pigment ink from stamps (not very practical for the <br/>
wilderness), and still a lot of scrubbing is needed for intricate <br/>
designs.  Baby wipes do leave a residue which can build up on stamps over <br/>
time, making they pretty sticky, but I don't know if this has been a <br/>
problem.  I know some folks have expressed a preference for pigment inks, <br/>
but my preference is dye inks because they dry quickly and clean up with <br/>
water.  Pigment inks are designed for use with embossing powders and heat <br/>
guns - that's why they're "slick" and don't dry very quickly.  If you're <br/>
looking for a metallic ink you'd have to use a pigment pad, and if your <br/>
stamp is not very intricate baby wipes will probably do a decent clean up <br/>
job after using them.<br/>

We clean the stamps we encounter with Baby Wipes.  We carry along a <br/>
1/2" stack of them in a zip lock baggie, and prior to and after <br/>
inking up, we clean the stamp by tapping it on the wipes then wiping <br/>
off any residue with a dry cloth.<br/>
<br/>
We've noticed that many stampers don't clean up after themselves and <br/>
often the stamps we encounter are quite messy.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>
