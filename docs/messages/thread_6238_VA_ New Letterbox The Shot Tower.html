The Shot Tower Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Planted: 7/10/02<br/>

First you have to visit the Shot Tower State Park.  From the park, go <br/>
down the stairs to the New River Trail.  On your left is a sign board <br/>
with a map of the New River Trail.  Just behind the Sign (about 5 <br/>
steps away) is a double tree just at the edge of the bluff. Be <br/>
careful not to slip down the hill! Wedged between the trees among <br/>
some rocks is the Shot Tower Letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
Caution:  I hid this box on a weekday, and there was no one around.  <br/>
When I came back on a Saturday, the place was swarming with people.  <br/>
There were folks camped out down below at the River's Edge and there <br/>
were bikers and folks on horseback around the sign with the trail <br/>
map!! It was not even a pretty day!  Cloudy and spitting rain! So be <br/>
very discreet if you go on a gorgeous weekend!!<br/>
<br/>
Also be sure to check out the New River Trail series of letterboxes!  <br/>
(3 at the time that I write this post -- NRT #1, #2 and #3)<br/>
