&gt; The Cottontails have had such bad luck!  And they have some of the greatest<br/>
&gt; boxes from what I've heard!  I've only had the chance to find one series of<br/>
&gt; theirs so far -- a Magritte one -- but it was great.  &gt; <br/>

&gt; I recently found an amazing box, with a fantastically detailed stamp [I<br/>
&gt; really wish I could<br/>
&gt; show it to you all so you can see it -- it was a stamp of the painting<br/>
&gt; "American Gothic"!],<br/>
&gt; planted as part of a series by The Cottontails. <br/>
