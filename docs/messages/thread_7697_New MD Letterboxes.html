<br/>
Cedarville State Park, Prince Georges County, MD<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Easy<br/>
Terrain:  3.5 - 4 mile loop, mostly flat<br/>
Placed:  9/14/02 by Celtic Pride<br/>
Nearest town:  Brandywine<br/>
<br/>
To get to park:  From the beltway take exit 7A Route 5<br/>
(Branch Ave.) south, past where Rts. 301 and 5 merge. <br/>
Go 2 miles south of the merge and turn left onto<br/>
Cedarville Road.  Continue on Cedarville Rd. by making<br/>
a right just before the power plant.  Go two miles and<br/>
make a left onto Bee Oak Rd. into the park.  There is<br/>
a brown park sign at this corner.  There is an honor<br/>
system for a $2 fee at the HQ building.  <br/>
<br/>
To the trail:  After being honorable, continue past HQ<br/>
and make the second right onto Forest Rd. (dirt). <br/>
Park in the first parking area on the right.  The<br/>
Heritage Trail/Blue Blazes Loop will be your trek<br/>
today.<br/>
<br/>
CAUTION:  There is hunting (in season) in parts of the<br/>
park.  Please be careful!<br/>
<br/>
Lightning Bolt<br/>
Take the trail into the woods to the "T" intersection.<br/>
 At 230 degrees head off on the blue trail and cross a<br/>
wooden bridge.  Soon after, the orange trail walks<br/>
along with the blue, so dont get confused.  At the<br/>
service road, turn right and go over the creek.  When<br/>
you have a choice, follow the blue at 157 degrees. <br/>
Cross 2 wooden bridges and continue until you see an<br/>
unmarked stony path leading up a hill at 72 degrees. <br/>
There will be a blue dot trail mark on a tree at this<br/>
convergence.  Head up the hill 45 paces.  At this<br/>
point turn and look east, past a rotted stump to a<br/>
large tree.  Head 15 paces to the tree and at the back<br/>
of the treeShazam!<br/>
<br/>
Holly &amp; Berries<br/>
Go back downhill to the trail and head left.  Be sure<br/>
to notice Lisa, GI Joe and Yogi!  Just after the 1<br/>
mile marker the trial heads 105 degrees.  Next youll<br/>
cross a wooden bridge, and as you crest the hill<br/>
youll see a large knotted tree to the left of the<br/>
trail.  Look in the crook of the 6 trunked holly tree<br/>
for your prickly prize!<br/>
<br/>
Archery Anyone?<br/>
Continue along blue, cross the service road, and enter<br/>
Geena Davis practice area.  At target #16, the blue<br/>
trail heads 130 degrees so dont be fooled by other<br/>
paths.  Watch for the double blue marking on the trees<br/>
for confirmation you are heading in the correct<br/>
direction.  Continue on trail, cross Forest Rd. and<br/>
another service road.  Be on the lookout for Tommy and<br/>
then Tony Proctor.  Go 20 paces from Tony and at 290<br/>
degrees head 15 paces to the base of a large "Y" tree.<br/>
 Therein lies the target.<br/>
<br/>
Cedarville State Park<br/>
Continue on blue and cross two more wooden bridges. <br/>
Wave to Hayle as you walk by!  After a half a mile<br/>
youll venture through the skinny tree forest and<br/>
cross yes, another service road.  More skinny trees!!!<br/>
 When you get to the #4 post you are getting close. <br/>
At the post, stand at the far left of the trail.  At<br/>
30 degrees "X" marks the mad, mad, mad, mad spot.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on trail to finish loop.  Thanks for stopping<br/>
by!<br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
1)  Some off trail walking is involved.<br/>
2)  Please wear gloves or poke with a stick before<br/>
putting your hand into dark places.<br/>
3)  All degrees magnetic.<br/>
4)  1 pace = 1 footfall.<br/>
<br/>

MD would correct my misdirection.<br/>
