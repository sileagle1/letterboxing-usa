Clearly this is most likely a scam.  Reminds me of a time in which Greta<br/>
(my wife to be) and I signed up for a free car raffle in the mall, which<br/>
led to them offering us a cruise package for a very low price on the<br/>
condition of attending a time-share presentation.  From what I heard the<br/>
cruise they offered was just a little boat with Bingo and two slot<br/>
machines etc... Obviously we didn't bite.<br/>
<br/>
This add mentioned a cruise retail value of $129, sounds like the same<br/>
deal to me.<br/>
<br/>
But I am glad to say that we did book a real cruise for the carribean<br/>
through AAA for our July honeymoon.  Can't wait.  Hopefully we will place<br/>
a few boxes down there for other vacation letterboxers. Mabey even visit<br/>
"the Chili Pepper" if time permits.<br/>
