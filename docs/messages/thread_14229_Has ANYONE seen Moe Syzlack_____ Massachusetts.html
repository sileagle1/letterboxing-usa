We were wondering if anyone may have seen our favorite<br/>
bartender hanging around in a box in Middlesex County?<br/>
If you happen to see Homer's friend, we would love to <br/>
hear from you.<br/>
<br/>
Also haven't heard about any activity on the "Phantom" in the<br/>
Blue Hills. This is a wonderful letterbox and we left a little<br/>
critter there to keep him company way back in October (is that<br/>
considered cheating????) However, I think that this box is well<br/>
worth a look into in any case ;) (BTW - it's not one of ours)<br/>
<br/>
Well, Hope everybody has a fantastic weekend and finds lots of<br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
We are off to Vermont to Visit "Prayer Rock" tomorrow.<br/>
