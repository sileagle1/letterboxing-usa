We came up empty handed at St Paul's cannonball today. Pretty sure we <br/>
were in the right spot. There was a folded up piece of black felt in <br/>
the spot. Hope to meet you out on the trails some day. Would love to <br/>
exchange stamps.<br/>

&gt; Hi folks,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  We read the article that was in the Virginian-Pilot newspaper last <br/>
week and decided to give it a try. So on Saturday my 8 year old son <br/>
and I set out to find some. We visited St. Paul's cannonball first <br/>
and found it to be a very successful hunt. The stamp is wonderful! <br/>
There we met Babycatcher and her family and bevyg. They all stamped <br/>
our books and we stamped there's. Then we went to Hermitage Hermits <br/>
and ran into bevyg again. The Hermitage is a wonderful place- I had <br/>
never been there before even though it's right down the strret from <br/>
me. We toured the museun and enjoyed the pottery show going on in the <br/>
yard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to the Virginian-Pilot for running the article. I've already <br/>
told a number of other folks about this and hope to let more know. <br/>
We're also using this to help my son with some of his Cub Scout <br/>
requirements.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We're thinking about setting out our own box, soon.<br/>

<br/>Thanks to each of you for letting me know that St. Paul's Cannonball might be missing.  If so I will replace it in the next day or two.  I've already started the replacement stamp...lucky I kept an impression -- I can easily re-do it. 
<br/>Would have replied sooner but was out of town for the weekend. 
<br/>
<br/>Take care and please visit this box again soon!

<br/>Saw that the Redwing box in VA Beach might be missing...that makes me sad, it is by far our family's favorite box we've found to date...the clues and hiding place -- so clever!

</p><p>I hope they will soon get to replace the St Paul's cannonball- it was a great stamp. I just read that as soon as they can carve the stamp again that it will be back out there. We didn't get to check for more boxes this past weekend- too many things to do too little time! Hope to meet you on the trails soon.
