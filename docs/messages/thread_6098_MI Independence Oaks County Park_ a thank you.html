<div>Hi Folks!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I just wanted to take the opportunity to give a personal 
recommendation for some Michigan boxes. For anyone that can make it, PLEASE take 
a look at the Independence Oaks boxes put out by fellow list member Edugaytor. 
These are GREAT boxes, truly worthy of your time and effort. My fiance's bunny 
nose and myself have spent several fun evenings out at the park and we both 
wanted to take the opportunity to thank Edugaytor for taking the time and effort 
to plan and place such great boxes.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Being that we are both new to boxing and I can tell 
you were are hooked! We both enjoy not only the challenge and creativity 
involved, but I have to say we have not met a nicer group of helpful 
people. It is wonderful that all of you give so freely of your time and talent 
to contribute to such a FUN activity.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Alas..... my dear home state seems to be slacking in the 
ranks!! Surprisingly, Michigan seems to be running wayyyyyyyyyyyyy behind in the 
number of boxes placed.... YIKES!  Let me say that I am on a personal 
mission to see those numbers boosted...and boosted big time. As of the moment I 
have placed 3 boxes and have another 30 or so in the works. I am hoping to see 
those lower peninsula numbers double by the end of summer!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I should be ready to post the clues sometime in the next 
day or so and I look forward to any and all feedback so as to improve my boxing 
technique.  Please be patient with me until I perfect it.

                    <html><body>Wow!  What a compliment!  I am honored at your praise, Puppy Lover.  I was out placing three more boxes at the park this weekend past and was pleased to see your stamps in my books.  I even ran into a family who was searching for my boxes -- what a thrill!<br/>
<br/>
Like you, I am relatively new at boxing but am going at it with gusto.  I, too, am disappointed by the low numbers of boxes planted by fellow Michiganders.  Perhaps together you and I can at least make a dent in the dismal numbers this summer, both through the placement of boxes and advocacy.  (I've already got 2 friends hooked, one of whom has already planted two boxes!)  I placed three more boxes at the park over the weekend and posted the clues as July 6th: "Ladies of the Lake" (challenging), "49 Habitat Trail" (mischievous) and "This Place Rocks" (Watch for poision growth!), for a total of 5 in that park.  And there are STILL some prime trails and spots to box there!<br/>
<br/>
I am SO looking forward to some fresh stamps; can't wait until your boxes are posted, I'll be on 'em in a flash!  Since I teach and have the summers off, I'll be happy to be your Guinnea-boxer and let you know hot it goes : )  Glad to have you aboard the Ship of LbNA Crusaders!<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

<div>EXCELLENT!!!! Thanks so much.  All I need is 
some time to get things in order, the boxes are placed and clues written for the 
most part. There seems to just be a shortage in hours of the day compared to the 
hours needed to get things done. Whew.... I need a vacation....LOL</div>

<div><br/></div>Wow!  What a compliment!  I am honored at your 
  praise, Puppy Lover.  I was out placing three more boxes at the park this 
  weekend past and was pleased to see your stamps in my books.  I even ran 
  into a family who was searching for my boxes -- what a thrill!<br/><br/>Like 
  you, I am relatively new at boxing but am going at it with gusto.  I, 
  too, am disappointed by the low numbers of boxes planted by fellow 
  Michiganders.  Perhaps together you and I can at least make a dent in the 
  dismal numbers this summer, both through the placement of boxes and 
  advocacy.  (I've already got 2 friends hooked, one of whom has already 
  planted two boxes!)  I placed three more boxes at the park over the 
  weekend and posted the clues as July 6th: "Ladies of the Lake" (challenging), 
  "49 Habitat Trail" (mischievous) and "This Place Rocks" (Watch for poision 
  growth!), for a total of 5 in that park.  And there are STILL some prime 
  trails and spots to box there!<br/><br/>I am SO looking forward to some fresh 
  stamps; can't wait until your boxes are posted, I'll be on 'em in a 
  flash!  Since I teach and have the summers off, I'll be happy to be your 
  Guinnea-boxer and let you know hot it goes : )  Glad to have you aboard 
  the Ship of LbNA Crusaders!<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Rand <br/><tt>To

replacing the letterboxing info sheets!  I was out when I placed the box and <br/>
