My brother turned us on to letterboxing when he and his wife were here in <br/>
Dallas visiting a few weeks ago.  We printed clues to 4 boxes.  After 2 <br/>
unsuccessful attempts at finds in the Dallas area, we finally found our first <br/>
box in Ft. Worth.  We think the boxes in Garland and Plano have both been <br/>
removed or taken and would appreciate hearing from anyone who has found them <br/>
or can confirm their existence and we will keep looking.  Also, if anyone has <br/>
any information on other boxes in this area, we'd like to know.  <br/>
Unfortunately, this hasn't caught on as well down yonder and we might be <br/>
searchin till the cows come home, but we do like it and hope to continue as <br/>
time and travel funds permit.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear from ya'll!   (:<br/>
