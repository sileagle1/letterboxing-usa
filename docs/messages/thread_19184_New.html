I am new to the list, and new to letterboxing. Although I have known <br/>
about it for a few years, I am just now getting my supplies together <br/>
to start out. I have a question about getting a notebook. I was <br/>
thinking about getting a Rite-In-The-Rain waterproof notebook, and <br/>
was wondering if anyone has had any experience with these types of <br/>
notebooks. Does the stamp ink take to the paper, or does it smudge <br/>
when wet? I know that pen ink is fine, but wasn't sure about the <br/>
stamp ink. BTW, I live in Maine. Anyone out the from Maine?<br/>

I don't have personal experience with those, but I've heard that they <br/>
are awful for stamping.  The same stuff that makes it waterproof <br/>
makes it stamp proof as well.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to letterboxing, by the way!  Maine is a great little state, <br/>
even if the water does have leeches.  ;o)  Seriously, though, it's a <br/>
beautiful state for getting outdoors and hiking!<br/>
<br/>
You might also consider joining the Letterboxing Northeast talk list <br/>
as well, where you'll find Phyto and Isosceles talking back and forth <br/>
about Maine a lot.  They might enjoy another Mainer's presense.  ;o)<br/>

These notebooks are great for outdoor work (We use them for keeping <br/>
records while on archaeological digs) and will take pen and pencil, <br/>
but the paper is non-absorbant so it won't take sharpie or stamp ink <br/>
well at all.<br/>

That was probably more than you asked for.  How about you? Do you <br/>

I think my brother and family will be staying with us while here on <br/>
vacation. It may be hard to get away.  Where are you from?  Have you <br/>
done any LBs in NH?  My husband has placed 6 NH covered bridge <br/>
letterboxes in the last 2 months.  He will be placing one in <br/>
northeast Maine soon.  He is working on the actual bridge doing some <br/>
repair.  It is just over the border from Errol, NH.  It will be a <br/>
remote area but if a boxer lives in that area they will be glad to <br/>
have one close by.  Then again, I haven't looked, there may be <br/>
plenty up that way.<br/>

A danger with letterboxing in the rain is that very often the contents of the boxes aren't as weatherproof as your own gear.  Best to either take along a big golf umbrella or start up some library letterbooks or something indoors.  Contact me privately for hints on those - we've sort of discussed them recently.<br/>

  &gt; I was thinking about getting a Rite-In-The-Rain waterproof<br/>
  &gt; notebook, and was wondering if anyone has had any experience with<br/>
  &gt; these types of notebooks. Does the stamp ink take to the paper...<br/>
<br/>
  I don't have personal experience with those, but I've heard that they <br/>
  are awful for stamping.  The same stuff that makes it waterproof <br/>
  makes it stamp proof as well.<br/>
<br/>
  Welcome to letterboxing, by the way!  Maine is a great little state, <br/>
  even if the water does have leeches.  ;o)  Seriously, though, it's a <br/>
  beautiful state for getting outdoors and hiking!<br/>
<br/>
  You might also consider joining the Letterboxing Northeast talk list <br/>
  as well, where you'll find Phyto and Isosceles talking back and forth <br/>
  about Maine a lot.  They might enjoy another Mainer's presense.  ;o)<br/>

Hi Dana<br/>
You will find links to some helpful sites. Many of these and other <br/>
links can be found on the left hand side of the chatlist home page <br/>
as well.<br/>
Here is a major tip for you to pass along-STEALTH!<br/>
We have had letterboxes go missing due to a troupe of girl scouts <br/>
finding some of our urban letterboxes.<br/>
I even received a note from one troupe advising"after the last girl <br/>
stamped in(#12), we couldn't find the stamp so we put the box back <br/>
without it". (The stamp was found 12 feet away the next morning).<br/>
Letterboxing can be a fun thing for a small group, but letterboxing <br/>
in a urban setting is difficult for just two people. If you are <br/>
planning a troupe outing then maybe you should consider limiting the <br/>
size of the group and make sure the setting is somewhere that will <br/>
be fairly remote. <br/>
