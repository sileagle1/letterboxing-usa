Metoui's Chicken and I received our DEP State Forest letterbox <br/>
patch in the mail today. I know I'm blowing my own horn but this <br/>
is like winning the lottery for me-or back in the days of girlscouts <br/>
when you had badge earning ceremonies. How fortune to be <br/>
able to letterbox in a state that encourages visiting state <br/>
forests(the incentives don't hurt) .<br/>
<br/>
In the letter that accompanied the patch was an announcement I <br/>
will share with the letterboxing community- "On Saturday October <br/>
4th, plan on joining the DEP's Division of Forestry and the <br/>
Connecticut Forest &amp; Park Association in a family forestry field <br/>
dayactivities include, food, booths, demos on fly fishing, and <br/>
kayaking, field trips, slide shows, workshops, hikes, tours, <br/>
music, etc. All this will take place at the Peoples State Forest in <br/>
Barkhamsted, in Litchfield County. As part of the fun, we are <br/>
planning to have a demonstration on letterboxing and we are <br/>
hoping that this will turn into something of a letterboxer <br/>
get-together. So feel free to spread the word among other <br/>
letterboxing enthusiasts and invite them along"<br/>
<br/>
So I think this has the potential to be a fun event for everyone and <br/>
I for one am planning on taking that day off from work and <br/>
attending. I'm already planning a cool commemorative stamp <br/>
just for the occasion. Hope to get many exchanges, see some <br/>
familiar faces and sport my new patch.<br/>

I'm hoping to get out to Barkhamsted for the DEP "gather" as well!  Hope to <br/>
see all you DEP letterboxers there!<br/>
