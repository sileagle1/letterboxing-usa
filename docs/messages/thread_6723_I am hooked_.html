it a whirl.<br/>
I used the professional stamp that the family had been using to <br/>
portray Lizardbutt as the stencil. At first I was a bit frustrated <br/>
because the stamp is small.I used the pink pearl eraser that others <br/>
had talked about using. Even though my stamp looks very crude, it <br/>
works. Wow! Now, I have another beautiful stamp. <br/>
<br/>

Thanks for posting carving tips.<br/>
