                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK - I don't usually have much to say opn this list, but I feel I must defend myself from what I perceived as a personal attack against me.  I live on Mount Desert Island, which happens to be home to Acadia National Park.  There are lots of lovely public places on this island which are not part of the Park.  I have placed several boxes in these places (No - I haven't broken any laws) and there are other people who have placed boxes in public areas also.  My reference to Acadia was for those who might not know that Mount Desert Island is home to the park - and a lovely place to visit.  I was simply trying to be hospitable in offering to organize a gathering on this island - I never said it would be in the park.  It is annoying to me to be attacked for an offer of hospitality, by someone who is reading things into my post that are not there.  I referenced the old site - which is public and I referred to my own boxes.  I find it sad that with such a lovely hobby, with so many people who are so welcoming, this list on a regular basis, seems to become a place where people get attacked.  Perhaps before publicly attacking others, a peronsal email to get the facts straight would be more approrpriate.  'Nuff said.  My offer still stands.  If there are those who would like to come to the Mount Desert Island area for a gathering, I would be happy to help organize it.  And I'd also be happy to show all of you the many beautiful spots that are not Park property.  If this response has offended anyone, I am sorry, but the attack on my offer of hospitality was offensive to me.<br/>

person to mention the "A" word, but I said "area" immediately <br/>
following it. It is a lovely place, even without boxes, and the <br/>
loveliness extends up, down, and all around the coast of that <br/>
beautiful state.<br/>

How far a drive is Richmond? How about Rockland?  I have relatives in <br/>
both towns...I think I'll have to visit them too.<br/>
