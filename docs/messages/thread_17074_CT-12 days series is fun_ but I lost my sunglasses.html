wonderful series with cute hand carved stamps.  We didn't finish, but <br/>
have 9 so far.  Since it took us to the DPNC, where we had never been <br/>
before, we stayed long enough to get all the boxes there (we think)<br/>
What a wonderful place.  Thanks to everyone with boxes there,too- all <br/>
wonderful and in fine shape.  If anyone finds a pair of sunglasses <br/>
with reader lenses in the bottom half,they're mine :0( They are not <br/>
prescription, but still my favorites.  I think they are at the 9<br/>
(oops) 12 drummers box. Contact me at njks919@aol.com if you would <br/>
PLEASE.  Thanks--Sunshine<br/>
