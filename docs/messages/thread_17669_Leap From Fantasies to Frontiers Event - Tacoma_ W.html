a Leap Day Event here in Tacoma if anyone is interested! Here is what <br/>
we have so far!<br/>
<br/>
Day:Sunday, February 29th<br/>
Place: Pt. Defiance Park (Tacoma, WA)<br/>
       Kitchen Shelter at NeverNeverLand/Ft.Nisqually<br/>
Time: 1pm-4pm (Main Event)<br/>
<br/>
The name for this event is geared around Leap Year, NeverNeverLand <br/>
and Ft. Nisqually. We are planning on this being a potluck luncheon. <br/>
Each family/person needs to bring their own plates,utensils, hot/cold <br/>
drinks and a potluck dish to share.<br/>
<br/>
We are aware that this is a Sunday event and that some may have <br/>
church schedules to attend and thus we have proposed the later 1pm <br/>
start time. We figure some people may come early to hunt/place boxes, <br/>
eat then leave or some may come at 1pm eat, box, exchange, chat and <br/>
maybe place a box or two even! Some may come early and stay the whole <br/>
day!! <br/>
<br/>
The kitchen/shelter has running water and a bathroom nearby, plenty <br/>
of parking and a nice starting place for many boxes that could be <br/>
clustered/hidden nearby! I know that I've already staked out about 3 <br/>
different areas I'd like to hide some boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Bring clues to boxes may hide for the event and feel free to carve <br/>
event stamps if you are so inclined. The park has many wonderful <br/>
boxes already hidden in various locations. We figure that the <br/>
Fantasy/Frontier theme may even inspire a few more!!<br/>
<br/>
So..get your carving tools out, boxes placed, clues ready and be <br/>
prepared to join us for a once in every four years day of leap year <br/>
boxing! We want this to be fun, casual and family oriented day <br/>
celebrating Leap Year Letterboxing!<br/>
