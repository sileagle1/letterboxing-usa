Its your box, and your prerogative, and I certainly respect<br/>
that, but I would ask you to reconsider.  I think 3 visits/yr<br/>
is really high, and shows a high quality box, (without looking<br/>
at it, of course).  My guess is those 3 people really enjoyed the<br/>
experience, and, projecting forward, the three that visit it<br/>
next year will also really enjoy it.  Those three positive<br/>
experiences next year will disappear if you retire the box.<br/>
<br/>
I have one box that has had 2 visits in 7 years, which works out<br/>
to, well, whatever it works out to per annum.  I wouldn't retire<br/>
it for the world.<br/>

The first visitor to the older box emailed me a terrific story about finding<br/>

and how he lived the location as I envisioned someone would when I planted<br/>
the box.  That one find is worth 50 on my other boxes.  I don't think I<br/>

Obviously you can do as you want to do, but please reconsider retiring low<br/>
traffic boxes.  If you felt strongly enough about the location to plant a<br/>
box there, then there is where a box should be.  And if the location strikes<br/>
you strongly, that feeling will come through to a finder, who will<br/>
appreciate the location similarly.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">All of you made some good points and as I said this is not something <br/>
that I am definitly going to do. The problem though, for me is not so <br/>
much one of being "making sure" that the box was not muggled or even <br/>
that the log book may be full, it's the container holding up to the <br/>
elements that has me checking the boxes once or twice a year. <br/>
<br/>
I want to make sure that on the really remote boxes especially, that <br/>
a boxer who takes the trouble to hike in finds the box, or at a <br/>
minimum have the box be their in good shape to find. I have been <br/>
having trouble with some of my boxes, especially the older rubbermaid <br/>
ones. I have since switched to lock-n-locks and after checking two <br/>
from this past winter I am very pleased with how they held up, but my <br/>
question is will they hold up for years and is that the container <br/>
that I want to use for a remote box that I may not visit for a couple <br/>
of years?<br/>
<br/>
Ummm...I really am thinking now...Maybe the solution is a better box <br/>
box and placing it in a more secure area, one that would help the <br/>
box "winter" better...I think that I may use ammo cans for these <br/>
remote boxes. I have two really remote ones that I could set up with <br/>
ammo cans and a large notebook and forget about them (for a longer <br/>
period of time), that may be the solution for me. I know these <br/>
containers work as I also geocache and some are liierally left in the <br/>
elements and are perfectly dry inside.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would whole-heartedly agree with what some of the others are saying.  I have several boxes that don't see even 1 visitor per year, but the stories from those who finally figure them out and nab that elusive find are true treasures.  I wouldn't dream of retiring them due to lack of activity -- it is as much of a thrill for me when somebody finds it as it is for them, and that wouldn't be the case if it was found 28 times a month.  On the flip side, I enjoy finding boxes that have not been found in a while as I feel like I have found a treasure that few other people have enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
I know it can be hard deciding which boxes to keep and which to retire -- most all of them have something positive going for them, and we all plant boxes for different reasons.  If your goal in planting a box is to provide easily accessible, high-traffic boxes, then your reasoning makes sense.  On the other hand, if your goal is to provide something out of the ordinary, a challenging &amp; rewarding experience for most seekers, volume of finders may not be the best gauge.<br/>
