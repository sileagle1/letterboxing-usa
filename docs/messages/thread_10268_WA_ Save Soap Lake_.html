Basically, it says some folks are interested in building a 60 foot <br/>
high lava lamp in the center of downtown to help draw tourists <br/>
and 'save' the slowly diminishing town.  I have to admit, I'd be a <br/>
sucker for it to.  If there was a 60 foot tall lava lamp within a <br/>
hundred miles of me, I'd be on it in a heartbeat!  =)<br/>
<br/>
But you've got to wonder--why don't the residents hide a few dozen <br/>
letterboxes?  It's a heck of a lot cheaper, and that would get me out <br/>
there as well!  But you got to give them credit, they definitely <br/>
think big!<br/>
