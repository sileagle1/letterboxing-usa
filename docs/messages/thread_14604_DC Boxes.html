The Robert Taft Memorial is missing, (well, not the memorial, but the box that is planted there. ;)  ) It looks like the area has just been mulched, so the box probably was trashed.<br/>

Skull and Bones at the WWI memorial also seems to be missing as I think some other people have posted.<br/>

Orion the Hunter is right where he should be! YAY  The black marble at Einstein's feet needs to be cleaned, the stars are not very visible, but the micro box is right where it belongs. It will need a new log book very soon. I did not have any supplies or I would have changed it then.<br/>

I'll try for others next time I get down there. <br/>

anything away to say that it requires careful clue reading.  S by W <br/>
has nothing to do with SW.  It's been declared MIA before only to be <br/>
found right where it's been all along.  :-)  Still I'll check it <br/>
sometime or hope you have an opportunity to look again and find it.<br/>
<br/>
Did you see the rusty keys?  <br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear Orion is still there.  I'll have to go change the log <br/>
again.  Did you read the weird message someone wrote?<br/>
