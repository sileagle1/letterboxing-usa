<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm new to this, but so far, letterboxing is 
amazing fun, it's one of the easiest ways to get exercise and fresh air while 
seeing fabulous scenery, and I'm meeting some of the nicest, most interesting 
people in the world.  Yesterday was a perfect day.  Absolutely 
perfect!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And HUGE and profuse thanks to Bruce 
&amp; Aili for yesterday's wonderful gathering!  I have a few photos 
at my own website, if anyone wants to see some of the people who were there: <a href="http://www.aisling.net/lb/may02g/pix1.htm">http://www.aisling.net/lb/may02g/pix1.htm</a>  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>(And yes, I've heard that some of the photos look 
dark on some screens.  Dial your monitor up so it's lighter, for now.  
At some later date, I may lighten all the photos, but for today, they're online 
and I'm pleased. *grin and shrug*)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you to everyone who was so very nice to me 
yesterday, encouraging me, and making me feel very welcomed into 
letterboxing!  I had a glorious day!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cheerfully,</div>
