Where: Gibbsboro, Camden County, NJ <br/>
Placed on 8/3/02<br/>
Difficulty: Very easy, 5 minutes from car. <br/>
<br/>
Since the 1852, the Paint Works has been a prominent structure in <br/>
Gibbsboro, NJ. The Paint Works was originally named "Gibbsboro White <br/>
Lead, Zinc and Color Works" and was founded by John Lucas and Joseph <br/>
Foster. This paint factory produced ready-mixed paint and was known<br/>
for <br/>
it's various shades of green. By 1887, the Paint Works became so <br/>
prosperous that a rail line was constructed to connect Gibbsboro to<br/>
the <br/>
Camden to Atlantic Railroad line to handle the high volume of<br/>
products <br/>
in demand. The Paint Works continued to operate until the early 1980s <br/>
until it was re-developed into an office complex. The main structure <br/>
still remains and sits next to a lake where you will find "The Paint <br/>
Works." <br/>
<br/>
Coming from Rt. 561 South towards Berlin, the Paint Works will be on <br/>
your right. Parking in this area is difficult since all the lots are <br/>
private for the local offices. I suggest going on the weekends when <br/>
business hours are closed. Please note that the park is only open<br/>
from <br/>
9am-6pm. I suggest parking behind the First Union Bank off of<br/>
Clementon <br/>
Ave from Rt. 561. Once you are on the path around the lake, start <br/>
counterclockwise. Follow the path around the lake and you will see<br/>
the <br/>
remnants of the old Paint Work chimneys which is now occupied by the <br/>
Lake Side Manor. Keep on the path and you will pass an area where the <br/>
path turns into a dirt path further to the right. Keep on the cement <br/>
path and you will see an upward slanting gravel path to your right. <br/>
Further down you will see a faint upward path. The third path will<br/>
have <br/>
a large twin tree to greet you at the bottom of the upward sloping <br/>
path. This is the path you should take with the cement blocks lining <br/>
the steps upwards. Once you are at the top, take the path going<br/>
right. <br/>
You will come to a triplet tree in front of you. From this tree make<br/>
a <br/>
left and follow the path downhill. You will find a gravel pile in the <br/>
middle of the path and from here you will see a small sewer pipe <br/>
emerging from the ground to your right. From this sewer pipe at 30 <br/>
degrees , you will find a twin tree. Behind this tree you will find <br/>
under rocks and twigs "The Paint Works."  Please make sure you hide<br/>
the <br/>
letterbox the way you found it since it seems to be a high traffic <br/>
area.   <br/>
