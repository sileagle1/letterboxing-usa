                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the positive comments on this project! I hope that it will <br/>
enable people cruising the web to easily find letterboxers in their <br/>
local area.<br/>
<br/>
Let me say,.. you haven't seen anything yet. Ever gone to a general <br/>
internet search engine (such as altavista or google) to try to find <br/>
letterboxing related info and sites? If so, you realize that most <br/>
listings have nothing to do with our hobby and are related to a film <br/>
industry technique with the same name.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't it be cool if there was a Letterboxing internet search <br/>
engine that _only_ included sites that were related to the hobby of <br/>
finding letterboxes? Then you could search on whatever interested you <br/>
and be confident you wouldn't have to sift through thousands of <br/>
listings unrelated to our hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't that be cool! :-)<br/>
<br/>

list is welcome to subscribe by sending a message to:<br/>

Ideas wanted, no technical knowledge is necessary to participate.<br/>
