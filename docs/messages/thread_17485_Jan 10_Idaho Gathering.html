                    <div class="plaintext-content">Cool! You added it to the "calendar" at the yahoogroups website. <br/>
Until a better Events page is reinvented (and one of our more <br/>
creative members is working on that), the calendar thing is a good <br/>
place to put these. Kinda like the dreaded database function, it's <br/>
not perfect or really easy to use, but at least it's free and it's <br/>
there. For those who aren't familiar with this deal, go to<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/<br/>
<br/>
(you may have to cut and paste that complicated address into your <br/>
browser)<br/>
<br/>
and then click on "Calendar." You can find several events listed <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Wish we could join you in that cold country for some frenzied <br/>
exchanges,<br/>

I'll be there too and as I bought my tire chains for the Salt Lake <br/>
City gathering, I should be set!  I'll just drive slow if it's still <br/>
snowing.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The 10 Jan 2004 Letterboxing Gathering in Star, Idaho proved to be a <br/>
roaring success despite the region being blanketed in snow.  A great <br/>
cast of characters showed up to converse in LB speak including:<br/>
<br/>
A-Bear (who graciously hosted the event)<br/>
Doc Peabody<br/>
Hannah Oakley<br/>
Lori Darlin'<br/>
Cadenza<br/>
rnrB<br/>
trkr<br/>
dvn2r ckr<br/>
<br/>
&amp; there were occasional sightings of J-Bear, too...<br/>
<br/>
Lots of fun was had by all, many boxes were found, incredible food <br/>
was consumed (simply scrumptious chili &amp; cornbread) and great ideas <br/>
exchanged.  As the group parted, Cadenza, A-Bear, rnrB, trkr &amp; dvn2r <br/>
ckr braved the cold temperatures and the snow to tackle some local <br/>
letterboxes in Star &amp; Middleton.  Again, we were fortunate enough to <br/>
experience another unintended bout of nighttime letterboxing with <br/>
zero nocturnal illumination thanks to the cloud cover in the region--<br/>
but everything worked out well, nonetheless, and we were victorious <br/>
in locating the boxes (just not too great at stamping in the multi-<br/>
colored &amp; quite detailed stamps that A-Bear has hidden around these <br/>
parts).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, everyone, for making this event such a resounding success.  <br/>
It's so great to meet Idaho area folks who are as excited about <br/>
letterboxing as we are--and what incredibly nice &amp; interesting people <br/>
they are, too!!!  I'm especially glad that A-Bear &amp; Cadenza have some <br/>
new letterboxing folks in the region as I think they were tiring of <br/>
only finding each other's boxes.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Have a wonderful day!<br/>

Just wanted to say thank you for the fun times last Saturday!!! It <br/>
was a pleasure to meet you all and to letterbox with you (A-Bear was <br/>
SO creative!! It was also nice to learn from your wonderful <br/>
experiences of letterboxing. I'm such an newbie. I can't wait to go <br/>
find another letterbox and use my markers to make my images multi <br/>
colored next time thanks to your tips!!!<br/>
<br/>
I hope your trip back home went well Cadenza...it was great you could <br/>
make it!! Adventure Seeker you get home safely now too and maybe <br/>
we'll meet up again next time...I know you'll be coming back <grin> <br/>
