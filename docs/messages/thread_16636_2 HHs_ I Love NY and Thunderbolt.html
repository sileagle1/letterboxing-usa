afterwards I drove around trying to track down "Phantom Cat" and<br/>
"Cemetary Dog" hoping add those boxes to my found list as well as that<br/>
hitchhiker.  It never occurred to me to check "Chautauqua Gorge"<br/>
because besides being the box closest to my home, it's also the place<br/>
I found "Golden Snitch HH" less than two weeks ago.  I figured<br/>
lightning wouldn't strike twice in the same place.<br/>

<br/>
P.S.   When you follow the directions for Cemetary Dog, Wales Center<br/>
is 5 miles EAST of Aurora, not 5 miles west like the directions state.<br/>
