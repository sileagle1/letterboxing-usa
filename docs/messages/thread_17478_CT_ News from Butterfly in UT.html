so happy to see the efforts of all you letterboxers out there for <br/>
those of us who don't have as many boxes to search for <br/>
ourselves.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone was delightful!  It was so fun to get together with <br/>
everyone and we got to top it off with a free carriage ride through <br/>
Salt Lake given by a friend of mine.  For those who weren't able <br/>
to make it, we missed you.  Hopefully the weather will be better <br/>
next time.  For those of you who took the time to carve for us-<br/>
thank you soooo much!  We loved the stamps and can't wait to <br/>
get the rest planted (the snow is really deep right now).<br/>
<br/>
happy hunting,<br/>
