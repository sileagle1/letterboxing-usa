Placed 1/27/02<br/>
Franklin County, Ohio<br/>
Difficulty: 1<br/>
This a Micro box (film canister) please take your own<br/>
stamp pad<br/>
<br/>
The 2ndt box placed in the series: Art in Public<br/>
places.  To find the area where to look for these<br/>
letterboxes all you have to do is go to<br/>
sculpturecenter.org/oosi/oo.asp. Once here you go to<br/>
searching oosi, you can either enter the artist name<br/>
or the name of the letterbox title under advance<br/>
query. This will take you to the site about this<br/>
sculpture and where it is located. Once you find out<br/>
where to head then read the clues to find the<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Malcolm Cochrans sculpture consists of 109 concrete<br/>
ears of corn, each approximately six foot high, into<br/>
the ground in even rows. Cochran finished the piece by<br/>
creating a row of text panels that explain the history<br/>
of corn production and set them among Osage orange<br/>
trees.<br/>
<br/>
Parking is on the side of the road that leads to a<br/>
company building. Once you have found the sculpture go<br/>
to the panel that discusses the Osage orange trees,<br/>
from here look at the tree at 295 degrees. The trees<br/>
landmark number is 4334, in the fork of the tree<br/>
trunks sits the letterbox.<br/>
