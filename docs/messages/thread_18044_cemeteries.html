                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, I've read all the posts about planting in cemeteries and of course I <br/>
have to throw in my two cents. Being a cemetery box planter myself, I <br/>
obviously find nothing wrong with it. Being of the mindset that ALL <br/>
letterboxers are careful and discrete I think planting a box in a cemetery <br/>
quite proper. What I find offensive are the folks that bury their dead pets <br/>
on top of my boxes. Lest we all foget dear ol' Gerbil Anon!!<br/>
<br/>
And just for the record I have done tombstone rubbings before. Wouldn't ya <br/>
know in a cemetery of tens of thousands of graves as I was rubbing this <br/>
particular tombstone the dearly departed's ENTIRE FAMILY showed up to pay <br/>
their respects!! I was at that very moment wishing I too were 6 feet under!! <br/>
Fortunately, they were all very gracious and touched that I thought this <br/>
headstone was the most beautiful I had ever seen. And yes, I know that could <br/>
have been a horrible scene. I chalk that up to youth and I certainly learned <br/>
my lesson.<br/>
