                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finally reached that seemingly ellusive goal of 100 finds!  Spent the <br/>
day in Portland, ME and found some really nice boxes (as usual).<br/>
<br/>
Riverton trolley boxes: only able to find the trolley.  The other box <br/>
was no where to be seen, dispite all of our efforts.  Slippery and <br/>
wet, will try in the dryer weather.<br/>
<br/>
Munjoy Hill Observatory:  Safe and sound.  Great spot both for the <br/>
observatory and the box.<br/>
<br/>
St Lawrence Church - Starry Night:  Yeah! 100 boxes found.  They were <br/>
getting ready for a concert when we were there.<br/>
<br/>
ME Valentine: Just for insurance went for 101.  Found it after a <br/>
short miscalculattion by fellow boxers (you know who you are!).  Neat <br/>
box, but I just wanted to warn Casco Bay Painter, that spot has a <br/>
hole through it and the box fell through on me.  I shored it the best <br/>
I could without changing the location.  It was dark when we found it.<br/>
<br/>
Now that spring is here (well almost) it is time to plan on some <br/>
placements and to get some boxers up to our area!<br/>
<br/>
On to the nextt 100!!<br/>

We saw your stamp in the Riverton Trolley, Starry Nights, and ME <br/>
Valentine boxes which we also searched for today.<br/>
We were wondering why we didn't see your stamp in the first Riverton <br/>
Trolley box, but it was in the second, but I guess now we know! You'll <br/>
just have to return at a later point since the box is indeed there. <br/>
Maybe on your way down the Letterboxing at Laudholm gathering which <br/>
we're hoping to see you at.<br/>
