I'm glad the event was a great success.  I know<br/>
letterboxingbee put an enormous amount of work into<br/>
making it perfect.  Next year, barring another<br/>
ambulance ride, I will DEFINITELY be there.  :)<br/>

Good Lord!  That's terrible. Are you feeling better today? I'm sure <br/>
everyone can understand you not being there yesterday. As much as <br/>
some of us are diehard letterboxers, I don't think any of us would <br/>
have went with food poisoning. <br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
