<br/>
Here in lovely Portland, Oregon I was out on the slough the other day<br/>
and some things have changed since I paddled there in April.  <br/>
<br/>
Letterbox 2, The Canoe &amp; Paddle of the Columbia River Slough series has<br/>
been taken out of commission for the time being.  The rock it was behind<br/>
was between two trees that fell this winter.  Now one of the trees has<br/>
slid into the water further and gaining access to that letterbox was<br/>
definitely hazardous.  I had areally tough time just getting to the<br/>
rock in my boat, let alone getting out to get the box.  <br/>
<br/>
After checking the box, I figured letterboxing should NOT be that<br/>
acrobatic and dangerous and I will replace it in a better spot sometime<br/>
this month.  Sometimes you put a letterbox in a safe spot originally,<br/>
but Mother Nature does her thing and the environment changes.  The<br/>
letterbox that  was once an easy gimmee became a more challenging risk<br/>
than I had certainly intended it to be.  <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxes 1, 3, &amp; 4 are still right on the water  where they always<br/>
have been.  I switched the critter-gnawed container of letterbox 1,<br/>
though. Only friends and relatives have stamped into them, so get your<br/>
canoe or kayak and come on out y'all!  <br/>
<br/>
To my knowledge letterboxes 5 &amp; 6, the landlubber boxes of this series<br/>
are still out there and have been stamped into by several people.<br/>
<br/>
We are hoping to nab some boxes this weekend.  It's not a competition or<br/>
a matter of getting lots of boxes.  I think it's just really fun.  I<br/>
also look forward to gaining the precious stamp image.   The dates of<br/>
the great hikes and beautifully carved images are so wonderful to have<br/>
in my journal!  I can honestly say that Der Mad Stamper, Thom Cheney and<br/>
Cara &amp; Kevin are terrific artists and I have loved collecting their<br/>
images.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to when we go out for Ryan and Glenn's boxes in the<br/>
future and see what they've come up with in the form of rubber!<br/>
<br/>
Take care and happy letterboxing to all!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
