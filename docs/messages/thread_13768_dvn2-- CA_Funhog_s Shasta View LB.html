                    <div class="plaintext-content"> We were at a 3-day quilting retreat and took a break to find the <br/>
letterbox, <br/>
&gt; looked under every rock and around every Ponderosa, got all <br/>
scratched up in the <br/>
&gt; process by manzanita (but not the "lone" one, wherever that was!) <br/>
to come up <br/>
&gt; empty-handed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, is it still there or are we miserably bad 'boxers'?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure that it is still there. It's further along the trail than <br/>
one might think. It would be quite bizarre if it were missing. I <br/>
do recall, however, that the lone ponderosa/tree in the clues (I <br/>
believe) was cut down by Christmas tree hunters last winter. I <br/>
think I remember Funhog saying she had to alter the clues to reflect <br/>
the missing little tree.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Further along the trail? We hiked quite a ways further than the spot we were <br/>
sure was "it" looking for a 'sharp right turn' and gave up after what I <br/>
considered quite a far trek and went back to our original 'spot'.<br/>
<br/>
Phooey!! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info. . .<br/>
