boxes.  Wanda, Pete, and Music Woman met us @8 a.m. to head south on <br/>
the river.  What fun!!! All boxes were found to be in great shape and <br/>
we had a mini-mini gathering back at the boat launch where we <br/>
exchanged and stamped into HH's.  thanks to Wanda for a great treat <br/>
of grapes,cupcakes and root beer. Check out the photo section!! Happy <br/>
Boxing everyone!!-Sunshine :0) and the Toad Dog was on his very best <br/>
behavior,too!!  <br/>
