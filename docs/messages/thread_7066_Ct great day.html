                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to the Drew Clan for a wonderful day. We hit Sherlocks home <br/>
for 2 then Zoom Zoom Zoom on to Ft. Trumbull and Ft. Griswold . <br/>
Cowboy loved the forts. We left a box soon to be posted from Pink <br/>
Trotters.   Zoom and Trumball had so many visitors we couldn't find a <br/>
place to stamp so we added a book to each box. The original is still <br/>
there with the amazing collection of stamps from near and far! So <br/>
many I hadn't seen before.  Out for another fun day tommorow vacation <br/>
close to home is rewarding. Will hit my 100 find this week. <br/>
