                    <div class="plaintext-content">I could use some clarification on a few procedural things. I <br/>
sometimes letterbox with people who live near me. <br/>
<br/>
I'll be going out of state soon and planting a letterbox while I'm up <br/>
there. I don't want to fill up the letterbox's journal with stamps of <br/>
people who didn't FIND it. Can my pals take the stamp from this <br/>
letterbox as an exchange without stamping in to the letterbox? Or is <br/>
there a separate category for this type of activity? Or is it frowned <br/>
upon?<br/>
<br/>
I also have ideas about making a hitchhiker or two. Again, I don't <br/>
want to load up the journal in the letterbox with non-finders' <br/>
stamps. Can they stamp their own journals with the hitchhiker's stamp <br/>
and count it as an exchange anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your insights.<br/>
