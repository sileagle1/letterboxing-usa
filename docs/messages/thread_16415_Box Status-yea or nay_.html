If in it just for the hike, then why letterbox?<br/>
<br/>
I want to know that the letterbox for which I set out is there before<br/>
hiking.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to know that a piece of my stamp art has been shared.<br/>
<br/>
I won't make the report that one is missing - but I will make the<br/>
report that I couldn't find one - and notify the placer.<br/>
<br/>
Except in the instance where I found the box but the stamp was missing.<br/>
<br/>
Those who do not wish to maintain their placed boxes should, as a<br/>
courtesy, confirm multiple reports of missing boxes and discontinue<br/>
the clues to that box.<br/>
<br/>
Those who do not want to know the status of a box before hiking need<br/>
not reference the database.<br/>
<br/>
Just as one may enjoy kittens but not desire to eat them, there's no<br/>
need stock up on recipes or comment on the flavor--just enjoy the<br/>
kitten. (Unless it's illegal to eat kittens.)<br/>
<br/>
One may enjoy hiking/letterboxing but not database information, so<br/>
there's no need to access it or express adamant disinterest--just<br/>
enjoy the hike/box.<br/>
<br/>
I will enjoy checking up on my boxes during the Mid-December box<br/>
maintenance week!  Who's been there?  What notes have they left? <br/>
Suggestions for better clues?  What are their stamps like?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Very good points there Ivy and I for one appreciate them.  The simple point<br/>
that I've been trying to say for quite some time is this......<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to make use of the tool, then by all means do so. If you don't<br/>
then...........<br/>
<br/>
Don't.<br/>
<br/>
It's really that simple. No examples are needed, no further explanations<br/>
really.<br/>
<br/>
Yet someone, somewhere will complain and feel the need to say they don't<br/>
want it.  And I defended their right to do that, so I'll listen to what they<br/>
have to say and smile, thanking them for their 1.012 cents worth (Adjusted<br/>
for inflation) and return to what I was doing before.<br/>
