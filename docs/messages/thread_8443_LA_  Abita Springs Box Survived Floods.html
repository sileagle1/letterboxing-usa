                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got a chance to check the Abita Box in Louisiana.  Despite<br/>
recent floods from Tropical Storm Isidore and Hurricane Lili, the box<br/>
was still there.  The only damage was to the ink pen I placed in the<br/>
box.  I didn't have a pen with me to replace it, so if you search for<br/>
it, be sure to bring something to sign the log.  <br/>
<br/>
The hiding area was unreachable until just recently.  I was pleased to<br/>
see that a hitchhiker paid a visit and has since moved on.<br/>
