                    <div class="plaintext-content">Do any of you letterbox folks feel this way at times -- I know we do --- I'd<br/>
like to ask that when you hide a letterbox, your clues on finding it are as<br/>
clear as possible.  YOU know where it is; WE don't.  When you say its the<br/>
tree that looks like an aardvark 50 paces to the left of the big rock ----<br/>
well maybe the tree doesn't look like an aardvark to me  and in a woodsy<br/>
setting there are 500000000000 rocks.<br/>
<br/>
I cant tell you how many we have gone to find following clues like   walk up<br/>
the road til you find a big tree with a branch that hangs low.<br/>
In nature preserves and parks there are a ton of trees with branches that<br/>
hang low.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you plant a box in the spring be aware that by august the weeds and<br/>
vines will grow and make it more difficult to find ---- if not impossible if<br/>
you have to cut thru vines and poison ivy etc to get to it,<br/>
<br/>
Remember too that naturally occurring landmarks like trees or stumps or<br/>
whatever can be cut down or moved or blown over in storms ----- the tree or<br/>
log that may be lying across the stream in Nov may no longer be there next<br/>
April or May. The tree that looked like an aardvark may have blown over and<br/>
now looks like a dead hippo on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
We really enjoy taking a nice sunny Saturday afternoon to get out and search<br/>
for these but many times our adventurous outing just turns to frustration<br/>
because someone has written  "walk down the road til you find a stone wall<br/>
and the box is on the left of the stone wall"  when it is actually on the<br/>
right.  Across from the big white and yellow house -- when it actuality it<br/>
was not across  from it but a half mile down the road and around a corner.  <br/>
 (Two clues from a recent letter box with details changed a bit to not point<br/>
to anyone specific)<br/>
<br/>
I know the fun of letterboxing is the hunt  but when it gets frustrating<br/>
because the clues are vague or just wrong it really does tend to put a<br/>
damper on the fun.<br/>

i dont want to have to start a flame war, but come on. why dont  we <br/>
just wait by the tree and hand you the letterbox so you can just <br/>
drive by without having to get out of your car???<br/>
this is what make letterboxing what it is. having to search for our <br/>
little gems that were created for us to find. <br/>
if you dont like having to search for the creations of others, then <br/>
join the postal groups and wait for them to come to you in the <br/>
mail..i dont have anything against postals. i have done many in the <br/>
past. and they are letterboxes to me too. <br/>
<br/>
it just irks me when someone complains about someone elses hard work <br/>
and effort to create something special for us who are serious about <br/>
this sport/hobby/addiction. ya, we all dont find every letterbox that <br/>
is hidden. and yes sometimes nature does tend to get in the way with <br/>
growing things around our hiding spots. but thats what makes it <br/>
interesting.<br/>
and yes, sometimes the clues are off. so send the planter a message <br/>
and ask if they can help with the clues. or try from a different <br/>
direction or come back another day and try again with a fresh <br/>
perspective..<br/>
but to want the directions to lead you right to the exact spot <br/>
without any sense of searching/finding??? thats not letterboxing to <br/>
me. the thrill of the hunt/search is what does it for me. and the <br/>
little gem that was planted for me to find is the added reward. such <br/>
talent that we all have. carving images out of rubber. hiding plastic <br/>
boxes in the bushes that sometimes dont ever get discovered. and <br/>
taking me to wondeful sights that i might never have discovered <br/>
before.<br/>

Yesterday I spent an entire afternoon searching for one box. I loaded my<br/>
family into a boat, powered across two rivers, and landed on a beautiful<br/>
beach. We then proceeded to see a beautiful heron, several large boats,<br/>
watch the jet skiers, swim, dig in the sand, watch the hermit crabs scuttle<br/>
across the beach, and watch the kids play on their "wake board". I didn't<br/>
find the box. I searched and searched. I found poison oak, stinging nettles,<br/>
and blackberries. My legs, arms, and head were all bleeding before I gave<br/>
up. Was I upset that I didn't find it? Nope. Disappointed slightly? Yes. But<br/>
you know what? It was an amazing day and I thanked the placer for sending me<br/>
to such a wonderful location. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's about the journey, the stamp is simply the physical memory!<br/>

i dont want to have to start a flame war, but come on. why dont we <br/>
just wait by the tree and hand you the letterbox so you can just <br/>
drive by without having to get out of your car???<br/>
this is what make letterboxing what it is. having to search for our <br/>
little gems that were created for us to find. <br/>
if you dont like having to search for the creations of others, then <br/>
join the postal groups and wait for them to come to you in the <br/>
mail..i dont have anything against postals. i have done many in the <br/>
past. and they are letterboxes to me too. <br/>
<br/>
it just irks me when someone complains about someone elses hard work <br/>
and effort to create something special for us who are serious about <br/>
this sport/hobby/addiction. ya, we all dont find every letterbox that <br/>
is hidden. and yes sometimes nature does tend to get in the way with <br/>
growing things around our hiding spots. but thats what makes it <br/>
interesting.<br/>
and yes, sometimes the clues are off. so send the planter a message <br/>
and ask if they can help with the clues. or try from a different <br/>
direction or come back another day and try again with a fresh <br/>
perspective..<br/>
but to want the directions to lead you right to the exact spot <br/>
without any sense of searching/finding??? thats not letterboxing to <br/>
me. the thrill of the hunt/search is what does it for me. and the <br/>
little gem that was planted for me to find is the added reward. such <br/>
talent that we all have. carving images out of rubber. hiding plastic <br/>
boxes in the bushes that sometimes dont ever get discovered. and <br/>
taking me to wondeful sights that i might never have discovered <br/>
before.<br/>
thats my rant for the day. thanx for listening.<br/>
later,dragonrider<br/>

If you see the clues indicate an aardvark (or in my clues, a crocodile),<br/>
it would be wise to look up an image before you start your hunt.  I also<br/>
make a mental note of the plant date before I give up looking, for<br/>
precisely the reasons you state.  My Dorf der Turmspitzen has not be<br/>
"found" yet, and when I went to check on it, there was no way I was going<br/>
to confirm it.  The area was overflowing in poison ivy.  I will check<br/>
again come winter.  Landscapes can change quickly and planters don't<br/>
naturally check on boxes daily.<br/>
<br/>
In a perfect world, you could notify the planters when you plan to hunt<br/>
for the letterboxes, giving them enough time to check on it and report<br/>
back to you that "it's there!"  If you are looking for guarantees, you may<br/>
be disappointed more often.  As far as accuracy in writing clues, we can't<br/>
always be 100% perfect.  When I find myself scratching my head, I laugh<br/>
and think, "they aren't going to make me give up THAT quickly.  Now let's<br/>
figure it out.  I'm responsible how I feel about the experience, and I<br/>
don't blame planters or woodland critters or previous finders if I feel<br/>
cheated.<br/>

I for one, find it much less fun and far less gratifying when a set of clues lead me straight to a letterbox, with no questions or doubts as to how something should be interpreted or which one-eyed tree was the indicated landmark.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is a hunt.  You aren't supposed to just be able to follow the directions straight to the box.  Think about treasure hunts of old -- people looked for years to find hidden treasures and loot that had been buried and marked on hastily drawn maps.<br/>
<br/>
Many people make their clues vague intentionally to create a challenge and make the finder think a little (hooray for creativity!).  Admittedly in some instances it is a true case of a typo or wrong direction (i.e. particularly when the planter writes the clues going backward), but even then as a finder you should always try every possibility you can think of -- if the box is not in the roots of the big tree on the left, perhaps it is on the right; if there is no fork in the trail at 90 degrees, perhaps they mean the fork at 270 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
The great thing about letterboxing is that there is something for everyone.  There are enough boxes whose clues do lead you straight to the box that if that is more your style, you can choose to do those (you can usually tell just by reading through the clues how precise or vague they are).<br/>
<br/>
Not every box is for every person -- not every hike is for every person, not every clue is for every person...  and you're not going to find every box you look for.<br/>

 It's the thrill of the hunt for me. The more obstacles thrown in the<br/>
mix the better. None of the best boxes I've found have been easy. Sure<br/>
following some easy clues to a so-so box is a great way to kill an<br/>
afternoon and does get me out in the woods. I do appreciate these but<br/>
they in no way compare to the thrill of overcoming the challenge of a<br/>
good mystery. I'd rather spend a day climbing a mountain or two just<br/>
to verify that they are not the place I need to be to find a Mapsurfer<br/>
box any time.<br/>

<br/>
Don't worry, you didn't.  It is quite possible for<br/>
reasonable people to talk about this without doing so.<br/>
<br/>
It seems interesting to point out a couple of things,<br/>
at least on the surface, that seem true --<br/>
<br/>
It is easy for hunters do decide which clues to do after<br/>
reading them; OTOH, tho possible, it is much more difficult<br/>
for cryptic clue writers to choose their hunters.  Just<br/>
a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Antecodal evidence (or at least what I hear, from my limited<br/>
hole), is that clue writers make more mistakes than hunters :)<br/>
<br/>
Be all that as it may, don't people see the beauty in the<br/>
semiotics of letterbox clues?  Here you have a platonic,<br/>
real location, with zero information loss at the time and<br/>
place of planting.  Then, thru the map of the writer and<br/>
time decay from time of planting 'til time of reading,<br/>
you have three points of information loss (the time decay,<br/>
the writer's map, and the role of the reader against that<br/>
map).  IMHO, all art in our world, whether it be music,<br/>
poetry, whatever, is what it is because of the dissonance of<br/>
information loss between the concept, artist, and artee (for<br/>
lack of a better word), and isn't that "Ah!" when we connect<br/>
with the artist's perception of the platonic concept really<br/>
cool?  (that is, clearing away the grime of this dissonance;<br/>
what Jim Morrision, or was it Huxley, called "The Doors or<br/>
Perception").  That "oh, I get it" feeling.  I'm in this,<br/>
for that.  People who aren't will find this post quite bizarre,<br/>
and I respect that opinion, just don't flame me for mine --<br/>
agree to disagree.<br/>
<br/>
And to think yoyos like you and me can do this thru something<br/>
as simple as letterboxing clues.  And that doesn't even count<br/>
the hike, the journey, or the thrill of the hike, even if<br/>
somebody put in under the wrong rock (like who cares, once<br/>
you get thru the fun part.  Turning over rocks is boring<br/>
and bad for my back anyway :)).<br/>
<br/>
JMHO.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I think it can be fun to do boxes with errors.  It is an<br/>
extra line of puzzle to try to figure what error the placer<br/>
made when you think you are correct.  And how do you know its<br/>
an error anyway?  You don't until you find the box, and even<br/>
in that case, someone may have moved it.  With so much badness<br/>
in the world, I think people should be grateful for free<br/>
art and entertainment in these clues.<br/>
<br/>

might have actually found some of it and destroyed the romantic quests!!<br/>
<br/>
Where would the Holy Grail be if it could be found?  Horrors!<br/>
<br/>
I heard that mapquest was invented by a guy who went down to the Caribbean<br/>
searching for a buried pirate's chest filled with jewels and gold coins but<br/>
the lousy pirates had been lazy and and all they had done was draw out this<br/>
stupid vague map.   When the guy found the map in an old abandoned shack he<br/>
was livid and vowed that all islands, coves, and roads would henceforth be<br/>
named and CONCISELY mapped out.  And he made his fortune on mapquest so his<br/>
Caribbean vacation turned out fine in the end anyway.<br/>

And where would today's top chefs be (aka our grandmothers) if they had to<br/>
follow recipes with concise directions?  On the other hand, some of my<br/>
grandmother's greatest recipes wouldn't now be buried with her brain.  (But<br/>
then it's not grandma's fault that nobody in the family thought for a moment<br/>
to get concise until well after grandma had died.)<br/>
<br/>
~~ Mosey ~~<br/>
<br/>
P.S.:  I think the reason concise directions wouldn't appeal to me anyway is<br/>
because I'll manage to get lost even with the most concise of directions.<br/>
That's why I'm a closet cartographer -- emphasis on the word "closet" --<br/>
because I'd hate for anyone to know that I actually should know what I'm<br/>
doing with a map.  And getting lost sometimes ends up being the best part of<br/>
the day.<br/>

Perhaps some seekers are expecting directions and all they're given<br/>
are clues.<br/>

To my mind, there's a difference between directions that are tricky <br/>

&gt; One of my favorite letterboxing "rules" is "if there's doubt, keep<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, the one where the clue says "turn left and walk to the orange <br/>
sign" and it turns out that the orange sign is 8 miles away.<br/>
<br/>
The one that bothers me more is the one that says "turn left" and <br/>
then in the next paragraph says "walk all the way to the orange sign" <br/>
and the orange sign is about ten feet from where you turned left.  By <br/>
the time you read the next paragraph, you've already passed the sign. <br/>
 Then you hike 8 miles looking for an orange sign.<br/>
<br/>
Back in the day, I participated in some road rallies.  The directions <br/>
were always a trip.  One time there was a set of instructions that <br/>
read:<br/>
<br/>
**********<br/>
<br/>
Pass a left.<br/>
<br/>
Pass 2nd left.<br/>
<br/>
Turn left.<br/>
<br/>
**********<br/>
<br/>
That means you take the 4th left.  Y'see, the rules say that each <br/>
instruction is independent.  "Pass 2nd left" means that, after <br/>
passing a left, you then pass two more lefts.  There were a lot of <br/>
very miffed competitors that day!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, here's my take on it:<br/>
<br/>
They're clues, not directions.  See what I mean?  Some boxes are very very <br/>
simple to find.  Others are a bit of a challenge.  That's why we hunt them, we <br/>
search them, we try to find them.  There are some boxes I've had to return to a <br/>
couple of times because I just couldn't find them.  There are ones I still <br/>
haven't been able to find, despite looking for them a few times.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not going to lie to you; I love a good driveby from time to time, but <br/>
they're not all supposed to be super easy.  How fun would this actually be if it <br/>
was so simple every time?  I have a box in California that cracks me up, <br/>
because every other report I get is found, attempted, found, attempted.  Sometimes <br/>
people ask me to clarify the clues for them.  It's not that I don't want to, <br/>
but I don't live out there, so I can't go back and check around and see what <br/>
else is there that I can use as a landmark.  But obviously, they're good enough, <br/>
because a lot of people do find it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure we can leave it up to the planters when it comes to how many <br/>
landmarks and how much they want to feed us.  That's the challenge that makes <br/>
this game so fun!<br/>

&gt; Yesterday I spent an entire afternoon searching for one box. I <br/>
loaded my<br/>

beautiful<br/>
&gt; beach. We then proceeded to see a beautiful heron, several large <br/>
boats,<br/>
&gt; watch the jet skiers, swim, dig in the sand, watch the hermit crabs <br/>
scuttle<br/>
&gt; across the beach, and watch the kids play on their "wake board". I <br/>
didn't<br/>
&gt; find the box. I searched and searched. I found poison oak, stinging <br/>
nettles,<br/>
&gt; and blackberries. My legs, arms, and head were all bleeding before <br/>
I gave<br/>
&gt; up. Was I upset that I didn't find it? Nope. Disappointed slightly? <br/>
Yes. But<br/>
&gt; you know what? It was an amazing day and I thanked the placer for <br/>
sending me<br/>

when it comes time to actually find the box, particularly when a box is<br/>

over 20 rocks, you step back and survey the scene, and it looks like a fight<br/>
has taken place.  It's terrible to realize that in your desire for a find<br/>
you're the one that made that mess.  One wonders what later passersby<br/>

<br/>
I have a letterbox in a Tract that is an 11/10 on the mosquito scale from late May to late August. I really don't want to have to check on it during those months. I put a note on my clue page that it's 'VERY BUGGY - wear repellent'. That way I hope people are suitably prepared with DEET and mosquito netting - west nile virus is a possibility so I hope everyone takes precautions - either don't go during the summer months or wear protection. I haven't yet had an "attempt" report on the box but if I did I'd add a note that I'd check on it once the mosquitos died down. <br/>
<br/>
I have a cache where someone reported being stung by at least 5 bees when trying to pull the box out of the stump and then being chased out of the forest by the rest of the swarm. I immediately "temporarily archived" it so that no one else would come to the same fate. Some people are deathly allergic to bee stings. Some people may not realize they are seriously allergic until they are stung. <br/>
<br/>
I like to give people the info they need to make their own decisions about whether they want to seek the box based on time of year, their comfort level and the health risks they're willing to take. <br/>

&gt; Don't worry, you didn't.  It is quite possible for<br/>
&gt; reasonable people to talk about this without doing so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It seems interesting to point out a couple of things,<br/>
&gt; at least on the surface, that seem true --<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is easy for hunters do decide which clues to do after<br/>
&gt; reading them; OTOH, tho possible, it is much more difficult<br/>
&gt; for cryptic clue writers to choose their hunters.  Just<br/>
&gt; a thought.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Antecodal evidence (or at least what I hear, from my limited<br/>
&gt; hole), is that clue writers make more mistakes than hunters :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Be all that as it may, don't people see the beauty in the<br/>
&gt; semiotics of letterbox clues?  Here you have a platonic,<br/>
&gt; real location, with zero information loss at the time and<br/>
&gt; place of planting.  Then, thru the map of the writer and<br/>
&gt; time decay from time of planting 'til time of reading,<br/>
&gt; you have three points of information loss (the time decay,<br/>
&gt; the writer's map, and the role of the reader against that<br/>
&gt; map).  IMHO, all art in our world, whether it be music,<br/>
&gt; poetry, whatever, is what it is because of the dissonance of<br/>
&gt; information loss between the concept, artist, and artee (for<br/>
&gt; lack of a better word), and isn't that "Ah!" when we connect<br/>
&gt; with the artist's perception of the platonic concept really<br/>
&gt; cool?  (that is, clearing away the grime of this dissonance;<br/>
&gt; what Jim Morrision, or was it Huxley, called "The Doors or<br/>
&gt; Perception").  That "oh, I get it" feeling.  I'm in this,<br/>
&gt; for that.  People who aren't will find this post quite bizarre,<br/>
&gt; and I respect that opinion, just don't flame me for mine --<br/>
&gt; agree to disagree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And to think yoyos like you and me can do this thru something<br/>
&gt; as simple as letterboxing clues.  And that doesn't even count<br/>
&gt; the hike, the journey, or the thrill of the hike, even if<br/>
&gt; somebody put in under the wrong rock (like who cares, once<br/>
&gt; you get thru the fun part.  Turning over rocks is boring<br/>
&gt; and bad for my back anyway :)).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; JMHO.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, I think it can be fun to do boxes with errors.  It is an<br/>
&gt; extra line of puzzle to try to figure what error the placer<br/>
&gt; made when you think you are correct.  And how do you know its<br/>
&gt; an error anyway?  You don't until you find the box, and even<br/>
&gt; in that case, someone may have moved it.  With so much badness<br/>
&gt; in the world, I think people should be grateful for free<br/>
&gt; art and entertainment in these clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers<br/>

Wow, well said.  It is facinating and gratifying to see one's own <br/>
thoughts or feelings lucidly wriiten out by another.<br/>

I had someone write to me once telling me that they couldn't figure <br/>

I replied that you are supposed to ask the locals.  Apparently this <br/>

anyone when hunting a box.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; However, he also is in this for the hike and picking up trash as we<br/>

Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tell him you're gonna go for a hike, no <br/>

<br/>
Well, unless there's a deliberate thing going on.  I've followed <br/>
clues where everything was backwards, left is right, up is down, <br/>
etc., etc.  But that was clear and deliberate.  It's the ones that <br/>
are just generally messed up that are frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
I found one box once -- after lots and lots of hunting -- in which <br/>
the clue was a drawing showing three things at three different <br/>
compass headings from the hiding location.  You had to find the spot <br/>
where those three things were in the right direction.  Problem was, <br/>
two headings were correct and the third was way off, like 20 degrees <br/>
or more.  That gets really confusing, because the fact of the matter <br/>
is you mathematically only need two headings to find a location <br/>
(where the two lines cross on a map) but one of the other two was a <br/>
broad landmark, there were many places you could be and still be at <br/>
the right heading, and NONE of them corresponded with that third, <br/>
incorrect heading!  All of which meant you had to pick two of the <br/>
three headings, ignore the third, and then search and search and <br/>
search.  If that didn't work, pick a different two and repeat.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Also, count me among those who appreciate environmental warnings, like<br/>
&gt; mosquitos, poison ivy, and mud.<br/>
<br/>
OK, here's a warning for you:  Here in Florida, watch out for poison <br/>
ivy on everything other than urban hides.  Watch out for banana <br/>
spider webs whenever you're in the wilderness (they're harmless, but <br/>
still icky.)  Mosquito repellant is a good idea for the warmer <br/>
months, although the mosquitos aren't really too bad in FL except in <br/>
the Everglades area.  You don't have to worry much about mud here.  <br/>
Beware of heat and sun issues, though; carry plenty of water and use <br/>
sunscreen at all times.<br/>
<br/>
Fact is, I'd have to repeat all that on just about every outdoor <br/>
hide.  It's not worth it, these things should be known to anyone <br/>
outdoors in Florida.<br/>

<br/>
Now, this hotel was a bit on the upscale side, and we walk in with casual clothes.  We saw that the lounge was in the hotel restaurant, the EMPTY restaurant, but for a few employees.<br/>
<br/>
So we're thinking, now what?  We can't just walk in and start searching, and without complete assurance that we were in the right place it seemed odd to describe to a hotel employee the whole activity and how we wanted to look around.<br/>
<br/>
While weighing our options, we were approached by one of the hotel managers.  Apparently four people standing outside a restaurant draws attention.<br/>
<br/>
He asked, "Can I help you?"  So I figured, might as well.  I said, "Ok, this is going to sound strange.  Have you ever heard of letterboxing?"<br/>
<br/>
He then replied, "I know why you're here, and I know exactly what you're looking for."  The LB was placed by an employee and he knew about it so he let us go in and do our thing.<br/>

Do any of you letterbox folks feel this way at times -- I know we do --- I'd<br/>
like to ask that when you hide a letterbox, your clues on finding it are as<br/>
clear as possible. YOU know where it is; WE don't. When you say its the<br/>
tree that looks like an aardvark 50 paces to the left of the big rock ----<br/>
well maybe the tree doesn't look like an aardvark to me and in a woodsy<br/>
setting there are 500000000000 rocks. <br/>
<br/>
I cant tell you how many we have gone to find following clues like walk up<br/>
the road til you find a big tree with a branch that hangs low. <br/>
In nature preserves and parks there are a ton of trees with branches that<br/>
hang low. <br/>
<br/>
Also, if you plant a box in the spring be aware that by august the weeds and<br/>
vines will grow and make it more difficult to find ---- if not impossible if<br/>
you have to cut thru vines and poison ivy etc to get to it, <br/>
<br/>
Remember too that naturally occurring landmarks like trees or stumps or<br/>
whatever can be cut down or moved or blown over in storms ----- the tree or<br/>
log that may be lying across the stream in Nov may no longer be there next<br/>
April or May. The tree that looked like an aardvark may have blown over and<br/>
now looks like a dead hippo on the ground. <br/>
<br/>
We really enjoy taking a nice sunny Saturday afternoon to get out and search<br/>
for these but many times our adventurous outing just turns to frustration<br/>
because someone has written "walk down the road til you find a stone wall<br/>
and the box is on the left of the stone wall" when it is actually on the<br/>
right. Across from the big white and yellow house -- when it actuality it<br/>
was not across from it but a half mile down the road and around a corner. <br/>
(Two clues from a recent letter box with details changed a bit to not point<br/>
to anyone specific) <br/>
<br/>
I know the fun of letterboxing is the hunt but when it gets frustrating<br/>
because the clues are vague or just wrong it really does tend to put a<br/>
damper on the fun. <br/>

and clear and concise and straightforward and to the <br/>

seem to have a long list of qualifications for what is or <br/>
isn't acceptable for clues<br/>
<br/>
"Remember too that naturally occurring landmarks like <br/>

So are you suggesting not using any types of trees in the <br/>
clues because they might cut cut down at some point in <br/>
time? Should I not plant in spring because there may not <br/>
be the amount of growth that might perhaps hinder your <br/>
search in august? should i not plant in september because <br/>
there might be snow in winter? i am sorry but you sound <br/>
absurd to me. they are called clues for a reason, they are <br/>
clues, or hints, not detailed step by step instructions. <br/>
and if a planter chooses to be creative in their <br/>
descriptions saying a tree looks like an aardvark, that is <br/>
their perrogative. they spent the time to carve the stamp, <br/>
possibly make the logbook, hide the box and write the <br/>
clues, if they aren't to your liking, don't search for the <br/>
box.<br/>

I had to laugh at this because I have one box where I specifically wrote it<br/>
in the clues that the box will be a difficult find when the leaves are on<br/>
the shrubberies.  And twice now this summer, I've gotten an email saying how<br/>
dare I put out a box that's too hard to find in the summer.  So even when<br/>
the clues *do* try to be helpful, there are people who aren't going to read<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well.<br/>

&gt; Sure, some clues could be written better and they can sometimes be<br/>
&gt; confusing, but I think that is one of the things that really makes the<br/>
&gt; adventure.  It is part of the human element in letterboxing, clues can<br/>
&gt; have mistakes, send you in wrong directions, weather they mean to or<br/>
&gt; not, and the joy is in figuring them out and finding the box.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes ponder over whether I should tell the owner about the <br/>
errors.  For one thing, if he makes the corrections, then the next <br/>
guy will have an easier time finding it than I did.  OTOH, with the <br/>
errors it may be considerably more difficult to find than the owner <br/>
intended.<br/>
<br/>
I ponder some more when there are a LOT of mistakes in the clues.  <br/>
Misspellings and bad grammar as well as functional problems, <br/>
misdirections and omissions.  If I listed all the errors it'd sound <br/>
like I'm berating the owner for a lousy job -- when all I'm trying to <br/>
do is help him proofread his clues.  Proofreading your own writing <br/>
never works, we all know that.  Anyhow, in those cases I usually just <br/>
pick one error to tell them about, perhaps the one that caused the <br/>
most confusion.  That way maybe the clues will gradually get cleaned <br/>
up.<br/>

What is needed is a general set of head's-ups for a region that <br/>

&gt; i dont want to have to start a flame war, but come on. why dont we <br/>
&gt; just wait by the tree and hand you the letterbox so you can just <br/>
&gt; drive by without having to get out of your car???<br/>
&gt; this is what make letterboxing what it is. having to search for our <br/>
&gt; little gems that were created for us to find. <br/>
&gt; if you dont like having to search for the creations of others, then <br/>
&gt; join the postal groups and wait for them to come to you in the <br/>
&gt; mail..i dont have anything against postals. i have done many in the <br/>
&gt; past. and they are letterboxes to me too. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; it just irks me when someone complains about someone elses hard <br/>
work <br/>
&gt; and effort to create something special for us who are serious about <br/>
&gt; this sport/hobby/addiction. ya, we all dont find every letterbox <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; is hidden. and yes sometimes nature does tend to get in the way <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; growing things around our hiding spots. but thats what makes it <br/>
&gt; interesting.<br/>
&gt; and yes, sometimes the clues are off. so send the planter a message <br/>
&gt; and ask if they can help with the clues. or try from a different <br/>
&gt; direction or come back another day and try again with a fresh <br/>
&gt; perspective..<br/>
&gt; but to want the directions to lead you right to the exact spot <br/>
&gt; without any sense of searching/finding??? thats not letterboxing to <br/>
&gt; me. the thrill of the hunt/search is what does it for me. and the <br/>
&gt; little gem that was planted for me to find is the added reward. <br/>
such <br/>
&gt; talent that we all have. carving images out of rubber. hiding <br/>
plastic <br/>
&gt; boxes in the bushes that sometimes dont ever get discovered. and <br/>
&gt; taking me to wondeful sights that i might never have discovered <br/>
&gt; before.<br/>
&gt; thats my rant for the day. thanx for listening.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Do any of you letterbox folks feel this way at times -- I know we <br/>

&gt; &gt; like to ask that when you hide a letterbox, your clues on finding <br/>
&gt; it are as<br/>
&gt; &gt; clear as possible. YOU know where it is; WE don't. When you say <br/>
&gt; its the<br/>
&gt; &gt; tree that looks like an aardvark 50 paces to the left of the big <br/>
&gt; rock ----<br/>
&gt; &gt; well maybe the tree doesn't look like an aardvark to me and in a <br/>
&gt; woodsy<br/>
&gt; &gt; setting there are 500000000000 rocks.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I cant tell you how many we have gone to find following clues <br/>
&gt; like walk up<br/>
&gt; &gt; the road til you find a big tree with a branch that hangs low.<br/>
&gt; &gt; In nature preserves and parks there are a ton of trees with <br/>
&gt; branches that<br/>
&gt; &gt; hang low.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, if you plant a box in the spring be aware that by august <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; weeds and<br/>
&gt; &gt; vines will grow and make it more difficult to find ---- if not <br/>
&gt; impossible if<br/>
&gt; &gt; you have to cut thru vines and poison ivy etc to get to it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Remember too that naturally occurring landmarks like trees or <br/>
&gt; stumps or<br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever can be cut down or moved or blown over in storms ----- <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; tree or<br/>
&gt; &gt; log that may be lying across the stream in Nov may no longer be <br/>
&gt; there next<br/>
&gt; &gt; April or May. The tree that looked like an aardvark may have <br/>
blown <br/>
&gt; over and<br/>
&gt; &gt; now looks like a dead hippo on the ground.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We really enjoy taking a nice sunny Saturday afternoon to get out <br/>
&gt; and search<br/>
&gt; &gt; for these but many times our adventurous outing just turns to <br/>
&gt; frustration<br/>
&gt; &gt; because someone has written "walk down the road til you find a <br/>
&gt; stone wall<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the box is on the left of the stone wall" when it is actually <br/>
&gt; on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; right. Across from the big white and yellow house -- when it <br/>
&gt; actuality it<br/>
&gt; &gt; was not across from it but a half mile down the road and around a <br/>
&gt; corner. <br/>
&gt; &gt; (Two clues from a recent letter box with details changed a bit to <br/>
&gt; not point<br/>
&gt; &gt; to anyone specific)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I know the fun of letterboxing is the hunt but when it gets <br/>

&gt; Here is a suggestion, if you want your clues to be perfect<br/>
&gt; and clear and concise and straightforward and to the<br/>
&gt; point, then write them yourself and plant more boxes. You<br/>
&gt; seem to have a long list of qualifications for what is or<br/>
&gt; isn't acceptable for clues<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;"Remember too that naturally occurring landmarks like<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;trees or stumps or<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;whatever can be cut down or moved or blown over in storms "<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So are you suggesting not using any types of trees in the<br/>
&gt; clues because they might cut cut down at some point in<br/>
&gt; time? Should I not plant in spring because there may not<br/>
&gt; be the amount of growth that might perhaps hinder your<br/>
&gt; search in august? should i not plant in september because<br/>
&gt; there might be snow in winter?<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that's what is being suggested. I take the suggestion more<br/>
along the lines that hiders  should check their boxes seasonally and<br/>
make notes in their clues when landmarks change due to natural and<br/>
man-made changes to the environment.<br/>
<br/>
For example: I planted a box in the early Spring and noted that a<br/>
landmark is visible from the road. I got an email in June that the<br/>
landmark isn't easily visible from the road due to heavy foliage. I<br/>
hadn't considered leaf growth when I planted the box. So I updated my<br/>
clues and added "in the summer months you'll have to peer through the<br/>
foliage to see it from the road."  Takes only a couple of minutes to add<br/>
the sentence to the clues and it makes the clues more accurate.<br/>

  O.K...no offense taken as far as replies to my original post below.  As far as senior adults, and young children...I will in the future, refer to our activities as "scavenger hunts",,,,,,I honestely did not mean to intrude your letterboxing space.  I just thought that is was fun to let the both young, as well as old people to engage in finding the letterboxing...but I respect your wishes, and will send a request to web domain to have my email address removed from this website.  <br/>

&gt; i dont want to have to start a flame war, but come on. why dont we <br/>
&gt; just wait by the tree and hand you the letterbox so you can just <br/>
&gt; drive by without having to get out of your car???<br/>
&gt; this is what make letterboxing what it is. having to search for our <br/>
&gt; little gems that were created for us to find. <br/>
&gt; if you dont like having to search for the creations of others, then <br/>
&gt; join the postal groups and wait for them to come to you in the <br/>
&gt; mail..i dont have anything against postals. i have done many in the <br/>
&gt; past. and they are letterboxes to me too. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; it just irks me when someone complains about someone elses hard <br/>
work <br/>
&gt; and effort to create something special for us who are serious about <br/>
&gt; this sport/hobby/addiction. ya, we all dont find every letterbox <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; is hidden. and yes sometimes nature does tend to get in the way <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; growing things around our hiding spots. but thats what makes it <br/>
&gt; interesting.<br/>
&gt; and yes, sometimes the clues are off. so send the planter a message <br/>
&gt; and ask if they can help with the clues. or try from a different <br/>
&gt; direction or come back another day and try again with a fresh <br/>
&gt; perspective..<br/>
&gt; but to want the directions to lead you right to the exact spot <br/>
&gt; without any sense of searching/finding??? thats not letterboxing to <br/>
&gt; me. the thrill of the hunt/search is what does it for me. and the <br/>
&gt; little gem that was planted for me to find is the added reward. <br/>
such <br/>
&gt; talent that we all have. carving images out of rubber. hiding <br/>
plastic <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I cant tell you how many we have gone to find following clues <br/>

blown <br/>

&gt; &gt; now looks like a dead hippo on the ground.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We really enjoy taking a nice sunny Saturday afternoon to get out <br/>
&gt; and search<br/>
&gt; &gt; for these but many times our adventurous outing just turns to <br/>
&gt; frustration<br/>
&gt; &gt; because someone has written "walk down the road til you find a <br/>
&gt; stone wall<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the box is on the left of the stone wall" when it is actually <br/>
&gt; on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; right. Across from the big white and yellow house -- when it <br/>
&gt; actuality it<br/>
&gt; &gt; was not across from it but a half mile down the road and around a <br/>
&gt; corner. <br/>

<br/>
Huh? I may not have been following the thread closely enough--perhaps<br/>
I should go back and read it before writing this--but I don't recall<br/>
reading ANY response that criticized you for what you are doing!! If<br/>
you are referring to dragonrider's response, which is quoted in this<br/>
email (which was quite enthusiastic), I believe that was in response<br/>
to The Sleeping Puppies email--as were the rest (at least to my<br/>
reading).<br/>
<br/>
With all of these topics that get peoples' ires up, and cause a flurry<br/>
of posts that argue one side or the other about "what is<br/>
letterboxing?" or "what is the right way to do it?," ultimately somone<br/>
posts a comment that "letterboxing is whatever you want it to<br/>
be--different strokes for different folks--just respect the<br/>
box/privacy/land and otherwise do it in a way that makes you happy."<br/>
Then several people chime in to say, "Yes, that's right exactly." Then<br/>
the "flame war" ends.<br/>
<br/>
And so it is, or would be if the "flame" were about your comments. In<br/>
fact, I don't even see anything in your original email that would<br/>
raise anybody's ire (although, granted, I don't always "get" the<br/>
opinions of everyone). On the contrary, I think, and probably many<br/>
more in addition to me, that what you are doing is fantastic! Don't<br/>
stop!! These are fabulous activities for children &amp; the elderly, and I<br/>
think it's great that you are doing this. If you hear any nay-sayers,<br/>
disregard them. Letterboxing is what you make it. Just respect the<br/>
box/privacy/land.<br/>

&gt; Hi All,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  O.K...no offense taken as far as replies to my original post below. As far<br/>
&gt; as senior adults, and young children...I will in the future, refer to our<br/>
&gt; activities as "scavenger hunts",,,,,,I honestely did not mean to intrude<br/>
&gt; your letterboxing space. I just thought that is was fun to let the both<br/>
&gt; young, as well as old people to engage in finding the letterboxing...but I<br/>
&gt; respect your wishes, and will send a request to web domain to have my email<br/>
&gt; address removed from this website.<br/>

&gt;  Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Just wanted you all to consider the following: I make letterboxing<br/>
&gt;  easy for elderly people when I visit them at retirement/assisted<br/>
&gt;  living centers. it is kind of like an "Easter Egg Hunt" for them,<br/>
&gt;  and they enjoyed the challenge of finding "The Treasure" within 30<br/>
&gt;  minutes. I have also used this technique with young children, and at<br/>
&gt;  the same time, teach the young ones how to read a compass...I just<br/>
&gt;  know that the young, as well as older people love this challenge of<br/>
&gt;  discovery....this activity gets both groups of people the opportunity<br/>
&gt;  to get outside and enjoy a rather new experience. I would appreciate<br/>
&gt;  your comments....<br/>

*DO* say should be accurate.  <br/>
<br/>
i agree about the accuracy<br/>
and as far as <br/>
clues vs. directions<br/>
<br/>
if i am making this a child friendly series<br/>
then i have "directions"<br/>
ie: Shop Till You Drop on Fortune Blvd<br/>
<br/>
if i am making this the kind of LB i like to find<br/>
with a bit of challenge to it<br/>
then i have poetry formatted "clues"<br/>
with some figuring out involved<br/>
ie: Dune Flyer<br/>

<br/>
 i dont want to have to start a flame war, but come on. why dont we <br/>
 just wait by the tree and hand you the letterbox so you can just <br/>
 drive by without having to get out of your car???<br/>
 this is what make letterboxing what it is. having to search for our <br/>
 little gems that were created for us to find. <br/>
 if you dont like having to search for the creations of others, then <br/>
 join the postal groups and wait for them to come to you in the <br/>
 mail..i dont have anything against postals. i have done many in the <br/>
 past. and they are letterboxes to me too. <br/>
<br/>
 it just irks me when someone complains about someone elses hard work <br/>
 and effort to create something special for us who are serious about <br/>
 this sport/hobby/addiction. ya, we all dont find every letterbox that <br/>
 is hidden. and yes sometimes nature does tend to get in the way with <br/>
 growing things around our hiding spots. but thats what makes it <br/>
 interesting.<br/>
 and yes, sometimes the clues are off. so send the planter a message <br/>
 and ask if they can help with the clues. or try from a different <br/>
 direction or come back another day and try again with a fresh <br/>
 perspective..<br/>
 but to want the directions to lead you right to the exact spot <br/>
 without any sense of searching/finding??? thats not letterboxing to <br/>
 me. the thrill of the hunt/search is what does it for me. and the <br/>
 little gem that was planted for me to find is the added reward. such <br/>
 talent that we all have. carving images out of rubber. hiding plastic <br/>
 boxes in the bushes that sometimes dont ever get discovered. and <br/>
 taking me to wondeful sights that i might never have discovered <br/>
 before.<br/>
 thats my rant for the day. thanx for listening.<br/>
 later,dragonrider<br/>

 &gt; Do any of you letterbox folks feel this way at times -- I know we <br/>
 do --- I'd<br/>
 &gt; like to ask that when you hide a letterbox, your clues on finding <br/>
 it are as<br/>
 &gt; clear as possible. YOU know where it is; WE don't. When you say <br/>
 its the<br/>
 &gt; tree that looks like an aardvark 50 paces to the left of the big <br/>
 rock ----<br/>
 &gt; well maybe the tree doesn't look like an aardvark to me and in a <br/>
 woodsy<br/>
 &gt; setting there are 500000000000 rocks.<br/>
 &gt; <br/>
 &gt; I cant tell you how many we have gone to find following clues <br/>
 like walk up<br/>
 &gt; the road til you find a big tree with a branch that hangs low.<br/>
 &gt; In nature preserves and parks there are a ton of trees with <br/>
 branches that<br/>
 &gt; hang low.<br/>
 &gt; <br/>
 &gt; Also, if you plant a box in the spring be aware that by august the <br/>
 weeds and<br/>
 &gt; vines will grow and make it more difficult to find ---- if not <br/>
 impossible if<br/>
 &gt; you have to cut thru vines and poison ivy etc to get to it,<br/>
 &gt; <br/>
 &gt; Remember too that naturally occurring landmarks like trees or <br/>
 stumps or<br/>
 &gt; whatever can be cut down or moved or blown over in storms ----- the <br/>
 tree or<br/>
 &gt; log that may be lying across the stream in Nov may no longer be <br/>
 there next<br/>
 &gt; April or May. The tree that looked like an aardvark may have blown <br/>
 over and<br/>
 &gt; now looks like a dead hippo on the ground.<br/>
 &gt; <br/>
 &gt; We really enjoy taking a nice sunny Saturday afternoon to get out <br/>
 and search<br/>
 &gt; for these but many times our adventurous outing just turns to <br/>
 frustration<br/>
 &gt; because someone has written "walk down the road til you find a <br/>
 stone wall<br/>
 &gt; and the box is on the left of the stone wall" when it is actually <br/>
 on the<br/>
 &gt; right. Across from the big white and yellow house -- when it <br/>
 actuality it<br/>
 &gt; was not across from it but a half mile down the road and around a <br/>
 corner. <br/>
 &gt; (Two clues from a recent letter box with details changed a bit to <br/>
 not point<br/>
 &gt; to anyone specific)<br/>
 &gt; <br/>
 &gt; I know the fun of letterboxing is the hunt but when it gets <br/>
 frustrating<br/>
 &gt; because the clues are vague or just wrong it really does tend to <br/>
 put a<br/>
 &gt; damper on the fun.<br/>

No, it's not.  I discussed the idea at length on the AQ boards, and <br/>
everyone -- simply EVERYONE -- told me there is nothing anywhere that <br/>
says a letterbox cannot involve using a GPS to find.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and not everyone can afford a gps unit <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, but everyone who can afford to drive 50 miles to find a <br/>
letterbox certainly can.  My Lowrance iFinder GO cost me $75 online.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; so why limit those who could find it?<br/>
<br/>
Because the box is planted in a place that there is no other way to <br/>
describe how to find it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; that seems like a tough<br/>
&gt; requirement, why not the option of GPS or directions concise or not?<br/>
<br/>
In many cases, it's simply not possible to provide directions -- <br/>
concise or otherwise.  In other cases, following GPS coordinates is <br/>
what makes the hunt fun, describing step-by-step how to get there <br/>
would be a spoiler.<br/>

I like to figure out the general locations of the letterbox(es) and then<br/>
mark the locations in my GPS unit.  For instance if the clues say,<br/>
'start at the corner of Lennox Avenue and Campbell Street, I can perform<br/>
a "find" in my GPS unit to find the intersection. Then I mark the<br/>
location with a flag. When I'm ready to go out to look for the letterbox<br/>
I use the 'find' feature again to drive me to the marked location using<br/>
the GPS's auto-routing system. It directs me to the the intersection<br/>
(tells me when to turn left, when to turn right, gives me the estimated<br/>
time of arrival, and how far away the location is). Saves me from having<br/>
to fumble with large maps while I'm driving and walking.  Also, as my<br/>
eyesight declines it's getting harder and harder to read the tiny print<br/>
on paper maps, the GPS screen is a little easier because I can zoom in<br/>
for a closer look.<br/>

turn by turn instructions.  You could write the clues as a story, or you <br/>
could use photos for clues.  I have some clues that are a panoramic <br/>
photo  where when you find that spot you are standing on the box.  Clues <br/>
are limited only by your imagination and creativity.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;I hope they don't follow suit. I have boxed in FL  and you are right it <br/>
does present a &gt;&gt;&gt;different set of challenges but  I just don't follow your <br/>
logic with the GPS, to me that just &gt;&gt;&gt;turns  letterboxing into geocaching. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ditto...... Yes, we are *most* challenged here in Florida, but that  just <br/>
forces us to be more creative. I recently boxed in Georgia  for the first time <br/>
and was deeply envious of their rocks, but I have to say that  I really love the <br/>
nooks and crannies of trees and roots - and the ubiquitous  SPOM (suspicious <br/>
pile of moss). :o)<br/>

 From what I've seen of the AQ boards, it appears to be mostly newbies<br/>
 patting each other on the back about having an icon of a cake pop up<br/>
next to their names and other such drivel. I wouldn't consider it a<br/>
source to be taken seriously.<br/>
<br/>
 On the other hand, you are right, there is nothing that says you<br/>
can't clue your boxes in this way. Kind of takes away from the spirit<br/>
of the whole thing though, I think.<br/>

Is this something similar to that ol' "The Lurkers Support Me In Email"<br/>
theme??<br/>
<br/>
But you're probably right.  I doubt there will be any rule anywhere that<br/>
says a GPS unit can't be involved.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, it's just lowering things to the Least Common Denominator.<br/>
Instead of dumbing things down for the finders, let's just start out by<br/>
dumbing things down for the placers.  Does this mean the chicken really did<br/>
come first?  Or does it just mean the rooster was impotent all along?<br/>

We didn't choose to not have the money for a GPS unit we just don't. Finders and placers alike lose out when a box can't be found by any and everyone. To each his own for sure. I suppose it's not a whole lot different than parking fees or placing boxes in zoos or amusement parks that require tickets to get into. (which we also don't completely agree with) Just seems kind of exclusive to force a choice.

No, it's not.  I discussed the idea at length on the AQ boards, and <br/>
everyone -- simply EVERYONE -- told me there is nothing anywhere that <br/>
says a letterbox cannot involve using a GPS to find.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and not everyone can afford a gps unit <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, but everyone who can afford to drive 50 miles to find a <br/>
letterbox certainly can.  My Lowrance iFinder GO cost me $75 online.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; so why limit those who could find it?<br/>
<br/>
Because the box is planted in a place that there is no other way to <br/>
describe how to find it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; that seems like a tough<br/>
&gt; requirement, why not the option of GPS or directions concise or not?<br/>
<br/>
In many cases, it's simply not possible to provide directions -- <br/>
concise or otherwise.  In other cases, following GPS coordinates is <br/>
what makes the hunt fun, describing step-by-step how to get there <br/>
would be a spoiler.<br/>

agian. That being "The proper way to letterbox" This one thing that I <br/>
keep coming back to and that most here seem to voice is that the how <br/>
is up to you. You are free to letterbox anyway you wish as long as <br/>
you don't impact on the activity in a negative way. But, clues, <br/>
stamps and containers are all up; to you and your creativity. If you <br/>
want to use a gps to locate your box go for it. If after a year you <br/>
only have two visitors well then you may wish to reconsider your use <br/>
of the gps or say ta hell with it and leave it be. This sport is <br/>
demacracy in action. If people like your idea they will come, if they <br/>
don't then they won't . <br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of remote Lb's and one has only 3 vistors in one <br/>
year. The clues to the box are easy, but the hike to the box is a <br/>
little vague. I could leave it alone and leave it for the dihards or <br/>
I could modify things a little and try and make the hike a little <br/>
more user friendly for boxers who are not as comfortable in the <br/>
woodlands. This weekend I walked the trail again and wrote a more <br/>
discriptive trail guide with landmarks given all the way up to the <br/>
Lb. Soon I will include with that a series that will end at this <br/>
place that I would like to bring people to. You see like using the <br/>
GPS you can make modifications things easier or more difficult for <br/>
the finder...it is your choice. It's a about the FREEDOM!<br/>
<br/>
That's my 2 cents.<br/>

Indeed, I think just posting coordinates to a box would be boring, <br/>
however, if you had to figure those coordinates out through some other <br/>
means and then go hunt the box, that would be much more enjoyable.  I do <br/>
believe Mapsurfer has a most eeevil box along those lines.<br/>

<br/>
I like to figure out the general locations of the letterbox(es) and then<br/>
mark the locations in my GPS unit. For instance if the clues say,<br/>
'start at the corner of Lennox Avenue and Campbell Street, I can perform<br/>
a "find" in my GPS unit to find the intersection. Then I mark the<br/>
location with a flag. When I'm ready to go out to look for the letterbox<br/>
I use the 'find' feature again to drive me to the marked location using<br/>
the GPS's auto-routing system. It directs me to the the intersection<br/>
(tells me when to turn left, when to turn right, gives me the estimated<br/>
time of arrival, and how far away the location is). Saves me from having<br/>
to fumble with large maps while I'm driving and walking. Also, as my<br/>
eyesight declines it's getting harder and harder to read the tiny print<br/>
on paper maps, the GPS screen is a little easier because I can zoom in<br/>
for a closer look.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What if someone is wheel chair bound, should we put every letterbox <br/>
right along the trail for them?  They don't even have a choice in the <br/>
matter.  What about people with small children, I guess every box should <br/>
be under a mile in distance.  And I guess I should just stop making <br/>
mystery boxes, because there are people out there that are just too <br/>
stupid to figure it out, and they should be able to get the box as well.<br/>
<br/>
It comes down to this, if you don't want to find a box, then don't.  <br/>
Don't complain about it, just skip it and move on to the next one.  I <br/>
don't expect everyone to be able to find all of my boxes, and am not <br/>
disappointed if they don't.  Heck, I was proud that I had a box that <br/>
went 18 months before it was found, it was just a hard box.  I have one <br/>
box on the top of a mountain that you have to pay to ride a ski lift to <br/>
get to.  It is not for everyone.  Not everyone will be willing to pay to <br/>
ride it, and not everyone will be willing to even get on the ski lift, <br/>
but I like the box, and that is all that matters.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes it is exclusive to force a choice, and you know what, that is <br/>
just too bad.  would be pretty boring if all the letterboxes out there <br/>
were in the same types of places, wouldn't it?  So yes, not every <br/>
letterbox is for every letterboxer, it is something you should learn to <br/>
live with, because that is how life is.<br/>

I think Geoboxing has a nicer ring to it, and works better.  After all, <br/>
you are not caching anything in the box, and it may confuse the <br/>
geocachers who may walk off with your stamp and leave a plastic mouse in <br/>
its place.<br/>

wheelchair-accessible boxes we could reach without every getting out<br/>
of our cars.  But in truth, that might discriminate against those<br/>
finders without cars, so I'm not sure you could ever create a box that<br/>
was findable by everyone in every circumstance.  So I suggest giving<br/>
that up as our goal.<br/>
<br/>
I plant a wide range of boxes.  Some are easy no-brainers, some are<br/>
more complicated puzzles.  Some are longer hikes, some are short<br/>
walk-ups. I'm cool with that, because as a result of the different<br/>
planting/clue styles, each box gets different finders.  And of course,<br/>
I have some that have been out there for years with just a few finders<br/>
--I could care less.  For me, it's not about the number of finders,<br/>
but hopefully the positive experience people have had in reaching the box.<br/>
<br/>
So, each box has a different target audience if you will.  To me,<br/>
planting boxes you need a GPS, a canoe, a cipher book, scuba<br/>
equipment, a zipline or an airplane to find is really no different<br/>
than a box requiring a 15 mile hike.  Nothing is for everyone. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I try to enjoy the boxes I can find rather than pining<br/>
about the ones I can't.<br/>

&gt; &gt; alike and there are no boulders. Even most letterboxers don't seem<br/>
&gt; &gt; to realize just how severely limited they are in possible hiding<br/>
&gt; &gt; places compared with geocaching. That's why I have now planted a<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox that requires a GPS to find, and hope that more people<br/>

&gt; Finders and placers alike lose out when a box can't be found by any and <br/>

<br/>
I would have to disagree with this.  If all boxes were placed with the intent of being found by any and everyone, a lot of the more creative and challenging boxes would not exist -- and that would be where we lose out.  There are many boxes placed knowing that they will not be accessible to families with small children or to people with physical limitations that prevent them from long or strenuous hikes.  There are mystery clues that the placer never intended for more than a handful of people to decipher and may require research far beyond the ability of most people.  There are boxes that require one to dive or use a boat or other special type of equipment and as you noted, those that require admission fees to the park, etc. where the box is placed.<br/>
<br/>
If somebody wants to clue their box using a GPS, that is their option.  Who is to say that a compass is affordable enough to use for writing clues but a GPS is not?  It all depends on your circumstances.  Fortunately there are MANY boxes that do not require a GPS and even some that do not require a compass.  Isn't that what makes letterboxing what it is -- that no matter what your circumstances, there are probably boxes that will work for you?<br/>
<br/>
While it may be frustrating when you have to pass up a box because of circumstances beyond your control, not all letterboxes are for all letterboxers, nor should they be.<br/>

When it comes to letterboxing it's all about the above *and* the contents of the box - love collecting those stamp images, especially the personal art (i.e. carved stamp images). <br/>

&gt; Subject: [LbNA] Concise Directions<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree,  it's very disappointing to look for these "movable clues" <br/>
and not find them.  I found that sometimes the the box is moved by an <br/>
animal or not replaced in the same spot as it was found.  The clues <br/>
are only to narrow down the spot.  Sometimes I find I really have to <br/>
look around the area more thoroughly.  Th 80 degrees end up being 90 <br/>
etc.  I know it's really is frustrating when you have hiked for 2 <br/>
hours to look for the spot and can't find the box.  I am really <br/>
annoyed when you email someone to tell them the box is not there and <br/>
they never get back to you -  I think if those that place the <br/>
letterbox should go back periodically to see if the clue still fit <br/>
and the box is still there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do any of you letterbox folks feel this way at times -- I know we <br/>
do --- I'd<br/>
&gt; like to ask that when you hide a letterbox, your clues on finding <br/>
it are as<br/>
&gt; clear as possible. YOU know where it is; WE don't. When you say its <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; tree that looks like an aardvark 50 paces to the left of the big <br/>
rock ----<br/>
&gt; well maybe the tree doesn't look like an aardvark to me and in a <br/>
woodsy<br/>
&gt; setting there are 500000000000 rocks. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I cant tell you how many we have gone to find following clues like <br/>
walk up<br/>
&gt; the road til you find a big tree with a branch that hangs low. <br/>
&gt; In nature preserves and parks there are a ton of trees with <br/>
branches that<br/>
&gt; hang low. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, if you plant a box in the spring be aware that by august the <br/>
weeds and<br/>
&gt; vines will grow and make it more difficult to find ---- if not <br/>
impossible if<br/>
&gt; you have to cut thru vines and poison ivy etc to get to it, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Remember too that naturally occurring landmarks like trees or <br/>
stumps or<br/>
&gt; whatever can be cut down or moved or blown over in storms ----- the <br/>
tree or<br/>
&gt; log that may be lying across the stream in Nov may no longer be <br/>
there next<br/>
&gt; April or May. The tree that looked like an aardvark may have blown <br/>
over and<br/>
&gt; now looks like a dead hippo on the ground. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We really enjoy taking a nice sunny Saturday afternoon to get out <br/>
and search<br/>
&gt; for these but many times our adventurous outing just turns to <br/>
frustration<br/>
&gt; because someone has written "walk down the road til you find a <br/>
stone wall<br/>
&gt; and the box is on the left of the stone wall" when it is actually <br/>
on the<br/>
&gt; right. Across from the big white and yellow house -- when it <br/>
actuality it<br/>
&gt; was not across from it but a half mile down the road and around a <br/>
corner. <br/>
&gt; (Two clues from a recent letter box with details changed a bit to <br/>
not point<br/>
&gt; to anyone specific) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know the fun of letterboxing is the hunt but when it gets <br/>
frustrating<br/>
&gt; because the clues are vague or just wrong it really does tend to <br/>
put a<br/>
&gt; damper on the fun. <br/>

Not to be a nudge, but your assumption of people's fiances is an <br/>
incorrect conclusion to your logic problem there. You've assumed that <br/>
if A is true, B must be true. But it's not. In our case, we can either <br/>
drive the 50 miles or buy the GPS. Not both. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; "so why limit those who could find it?"<br/>
<br/>
"Because the box is planted in a place that there is no other way to<br/>

<br/>
This makes me sad. It's a box that we will never be able to get. But <br/>
that's okay, too. I'm just very grateful that not everyone shares this <br/>
view. The lack of high-tech equipment is what drew us to letterboxing <br/>
over geocaching. The bizarre clues that sometimes have us going back a <br/>
couple of times or missing a box totally just give us more stories for <br/>
around the fire. Am I dissappointed that we had to abandon or efforts <br/>
while we were on vacation in Pennsylvania and North Carolina because we <br/>
couldn't find the "right" oak tree or "third rock from the sun." Sure. <br/>
But let me tell you, those clues live on in our home. That's all part <br/>
of the fun, too. Just my two cents. Hate me if you want to, love me if <br/>
you can.<br/>

Oh, and your $5 for gas does not take into account the return trip. <br/>
So your math problem for the day is:<br/>
<br/>
If a letterbox is 50 miles away and my minivan gets 22 mpg. Gas at my <br/>
local Walmart costs $2.56 per gallon, how much would it cost to <br/>
travel there and back?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know, my math problem is a bit much, but my point is that <br/>
arguements based on assumptions and generalizations are not very <br/>
strong or valid arguments.<br/>
<br/>
As for the whole GPS thing, I hope it doesn't become a trend. I love <br/>
the creativity of letterboxing. Will we find an "out of the box" <br/>
solution to finding a GPS box without buying a GPS? Probably. That's <br/>
just the kind of people we are. Knowing us, we'll probably make it a <br/>
geography lesson and have the kids figure it out, lol! <br/>
<br/>
Not all letterboxes are for all letterboxers. Ain't it the truth. I <br/>
am just grateful that there are plenty that ARE for us. By the way, <br/>
thanks to all of you who do take the time to plant boxes. Please, <br/>
know that we really appreciate it.<br/>

Either way, just because someone can afford the gas to drive 50 miles, or a hundred miles, doesn't mean that they can afford to buy extra equipment for a hobby that many people enjoy partly because they don't have to buy expensive gear.  I am in agreement that being able to afford one doesn't mean that a person can afford both.  If I had to buy a gps to be a letterboxer, I wouldn't be a letterboxer, but that simply means that I will not do a box that requires one, which is no loss as there are plenty of other boxes out there - and well within a fifty mile radius, so I guess I have the best of both worlds.<br/>

 If a letterbox is 50 miles away and my minivan gets 22 mpg. Gas at my <br/>
 local Walmart costs $2.56 per gallon, how much would it cost to <br/>
 travel there and back?<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, I know, my math problem is a bit much, but my point is that <br/>
 arguements based on assumptions and generalizations are not very <br/>
 strong or valid arguments.<br/>
<br/>
 As for the whole GPS thing, I hope it doesn't become a trend. I love <br/>
 the creativity of letterboxing. Will we find an "out of the box" <br/>
 solution to finding a GPS box without buying a GPS? Probably. That's <br/>
 just the kind of people we are. Knowing us, we'll probably make it a <br/>
 geography lesson and have the kids figure it out, lol! <br/>
<br/>
 Not all letterboxes are for all letterboxers. Ain't it the truth. I <br/>
 am just grateful that there are plenty that ARE for us. By the way, <br/>
 thanks to all of you who do take the time to plant boxes. Please, <br/>
 know that we really appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Well, let's see,,, 50 miles away is 100 round <br/>
trip, divided by 22 mpg equals: 4.54 gallons X <br/>
$2.56 per gallon equals: $11.62.  NOW, if you <br/>
figure in wear and tear on engine, tires, etc. <br/>
it'll be more, that's just actual gas.  So, let's see....<br/>
<br/>
The 2007 IRS mileage rate for business use is <br/>
48.5 cents per mile, up from 44.5 cents for 2006.<br/>
<br/>
So, you take the 100 miles X 48.5, and THAT <br/>
comes up to $48.50,,,, getting closer to that cost for a GPS....  ;-)<br/>

<br/>
If you think the cost of gasoline is the only cost involved in <br/>
driving, you've got another think coming.  And if you can find a car <br/>
that costs less than 25 cents a mile to operate, including fuel, <br/>
maintenance, tires, insurance, and depreciation of the car itself, <br/>
buy it.  That'll make the 100-mile round trip cost $25.  If you can <br/>
afford that, you can afford $75 for a GPS.  I'm sorry, but the excuse <br/>
that a GPS is unaffordable just doesn't wash for anyone who travels <br/>
at all to find letterboxes.  People don't buy a GPS because they're <br/>
scared of the technology or just not interested in it, not because <br/>
they can't afford it.<br/>

&gt; You know, it was a joke - the wording of your response can be <br/>
interpreted different ways (or maybe it was someone else's response, <br/>
I have lost track).  Either way, just because someone can afford the <br/>
gas to drive 50 miles, or a hundred miles, doesn't mean that they can <br/>
afford to buy extra equipment for a hobby that many people enjoy <br/>
partly because they don't have to buy expensive gear.  I am in <br/>
agreement that being able to afford one doesn't mean that a person <br/>
can afford both.  If I had to buy a gps to be a letterboxer, I <br/>
wouldn't be a letterboxer, but that simply means that I will not do a <br/>
box that requires one, which is no loss as there are plenty of other <br/>
boxes out there - and well within a fifty mile radius, so I guess I <br/>
have the best of both worlds.<br/>

&gt; Valid point however why purposely make it impossible for some to do other than by choice? We didn't choose to not have the money for a GPS unit we just don't. Finders and placers alike lose out when a box can't be found by any and everyone. To each his own for sure. I suppose it's not a whole lot different than parking fees or placing boxes in zoos or amusement parks that require tickets to get into. (which we also don't completely agree with) Just seems kind of exclusive to force a choice. <br/>
<br/>
What if someone is wheel chair bound, should we put every letterbox <br/>
right along the trail for them?  They don't even have a choice in the <br/>
matter.  What about people with small children, I guess every box should <br/>
be under a mile in distance.  And I guess I should just stop making <br/>
mystery boxes, because there are people out there that are just too <br/>
stupid to figure it out, and they should be able to get the box as well.<br/>

It comes down to this, if you don't want to find a box, then don't.  <br/>
Don't complain about it, just skip it and move on to the next one.  I <br/>
don't expect everyone to be able to find all of my boxes, and am not <br/>
disappointed if they don't.  Heck, I was proud that I had a box that <br/>
went 18 months before it was found, it was just a hard box.  I have one <br/>
box on the top of a mountain that you have to pay to ride a ski lift to <br/>
get to.  It is not for everyone.  Not everyone will be willing to pay to <br/>
ride it, and not everyone will be willing to even get on the ski lift, <br/>
but I like the box, and that is all that matters.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes it is exclusive to force a choice, and you know what, that is <br/>
just too bad.  would be pretty boring if all the letterboxes out there <br/>
were in the same types of places, wouldn't it?  So yes, not every <br/>
letterbox is for every letterboxer, it is something you should learn to <br/>
live with, because that is how life is.<br/>

I think Geoboxing has a nicer ring to it, and works better.  After all, <br/>
you are not caching anything in the box, and it may confuse the <br/>
geocachers who may walk off with your stamp and leave a plastic mouse in <br/>

 &gt; _to me_ that just turns letterboxing into geocaching.<br/>
<br/>
[My emphasis]<br/>
<br/>
I don't expect to add much original thought to this thread<br/>
that hasn't been rehashed a few billion times since May 4th,<br/>
2000, but, I will add a couple of facts, FWIW --<br/>
<br/>
* One of the earliest letterboxes placed, (long before<br/>
geocaching.com, SA was turned off, etc., placed by the<br/>
webmaster of the first (AFAIK) letterboxing-related website),<br/>
had clues that were GPS coordinates.  No one complained<br/>
then, IIRC.  It was only after geocaching was "invented" on<br/>
or about May 4th, 2000, that these complaints seemed to<br/>
surface.<br/>
<br/>
* An acquaintance of mine has found hundreds of geocaches<br/>
listed on geocaching.com, and does not own a GPS unit.<br/>
<br/>
Like all text, clues, this thread, or otherwise, it remains<br/>
up to the role of the reader as to whether the reporting of<br/>
these facts has any value or not.<br/>
<br/>
And, to offer an opinion, at the risk of claiming the emperor<br/>
has no clothes, from the point of encountering text that<br/>
describes the location of something hidden to the point of<br/>
setting eyes on the hidden container, there is _absolutely<br/>
zero difference_ in these games.  Of course, like most<br/>
semiotic problems, the text comes with so much baggage, like<br/>
what it is called, what website it happens to be hosted on,<br/>
cultural, etc., that, while it is tempting to declare these<br/>
debates abjectly silly on the surface, it is not so after<br/>
considering this baggage, many times of which it is not easy<br/>
to be aware of or free oneself from.  (and I am intimately<br/>
familiar with clues that demonstrate this principle so<br/>
brilliantly, if I may say so myself).  I will, however,<br/>
reiterate my opinion that these debates are abjectly silly<br/>
in the aspect that they offer no original thought (including<br/>
this one, but it can be fun sometimes, can't it? :-)).<br/>
<br/>
In any case, some clues I've written have been done with<br/>
GPS unit in hand, and while I never offer intent on how they<br/>
are to be figured, I will offer it is likely much easier if<br/>
the seeker also has a GPS unit.  As as been said, if you don't<br/>
like them, don't do them (a sentiment that really could have<br/>
been said as the first response to this thread (and probably<br/>
was), and ended it (and probably didn't)).  Unlike others,<br/>
however, I don't care one way or the other if anyone looks for<br/>
them.  It is all what we make of it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I must have written this post a billion times, but<br/>
it is fun each time.  The word choice and lyric always comes<br/>
out a bit different, and if I can make it even more<br/>
pretentious than last time, so much the better :)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I will endorse Silver Eagle's post in this thread.<br/>
There is a difference between clever and unclear.  Perhaps I<br/>
can sum up a sentiment that we can all live with:<br/>
<br/>
"Use concise directions in the parts that aren't part of the puzzle."<br/>
<br/>
I try to do this.  C'mon, "tooth-shaped rock".  How much<br/>
clearer can one be :-)<br/>
<br/>

For some reason that completely eludes me, I've been following this thread.<br/>
I only dabble in reading the posts to several letterboxing lists, so it is<br/>
unusual for me to follow such a long (and, I hasten to say, silly) thread.<br/>
It started before my vacation &amp; is still going on! I was reading some posts<br/>
a couple of days ago and said to myself, "Self, you have 8 billion things to<br/>
do, this thread is going nowhere &amp; has little bearing on your life at this<br/>
point, why, in God's name, are you spending so much time reading all the<br/>
posts???"<br/>
<br/>
Well, fortunately, Sheba provided the explanation. I waded through the muck<br/>
long enough to be rewarded with a good laugh. Thanks Sheba!! :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Wow.  Where are you buying gas that it costs $75<br/>

&gt; &gt; Around these parts it would cost less than $5 if<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you think the cost of gasoline is the only cost<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to agree with Tony on this one. If I want a GPS system I'm going to budget for it and not buy a cheap one from a company that may not be around next year to update it. There are some people who don't think a GPS system is a top priority and won't bother to budget extra money to buy one. Not only that but a GPS system in my opinion is still on the level of Mapquest.com it can still be wrong. I would rather save my money and wait for the technology to get better than waste the money on something I will have to replace because the cheap model is not compatible with improved technology. <br/>
<br/>
Granted a GPS system can be helpful however unless the creator of the  box uses GPS coordinates it's not going to help you get the exact location on the letterbox. I know someone mentioned using GPS coordinates for their letterbox earlier which I don't see a problem with, if the box is still around when I get a GPS system I'll be more than happy to look for it :). But I'm not going to rush out and buy one just because someone else thinks I should have one to letterbox. <br/>

&gt;&gt;   I'm sorry, but the excuse <br/>
&gt;&gt;   that a GPS is unaffordable just doesn't wash for anyone who travels <br/>
&gt;&gt;   at all to find letterboxes. People don't buy a GPS because they're <br/>

&gt;&gt;   they can't afford it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   Yes, it does wash.  It's called living on a budget, <br/>
<br/>
I wrote a rather long and pretentious post (as usual) on  this earlier<br/>
in the day, but decided to let it drop.  Perhaps I should have, but it<br/>
is difficult to let things that are just plain wrong go by, especially<br/>
when, as Tony points out, it does wash.<br/>
<br/>
To summarize, GPS devices are luxury goods that add expense on the<br/>
margin.  (all terms intended to be construed as economics jargon).<br/>
They are above and beyond the travel expenses articulated (not<br/>
quoted above, but in the original post).  Moreover, many of the<br/>
travel expenses articulated can be amortized over non-letterboxing<br/>
activities (eg -- depreciation of the car, insurance, and the like),<br/>
and in American society, a car is a necessity as opposed to a luxury.<br/>
<br/>
On the flip side, it is unlikely that the cost of a GPS unit can be<br/>
amortized over the number of letterboxes that require the use of a GPS<br/>
unit to find (if the putative owner, for cultural or other irrational<br/>
reasons, is not interested in geocaching).  (And even if it can, there<br/>
is still _some_ cost on the margin beyond the travel costs).<br/>
<br/>
Put in plain English (and a dash of latin), if one is paying $75 to<br/>
travel to a letterbox that does not require a GPS unit to find, they<br/>
would pay $75 + X to travel to one requiring a GPS unit to find,<br/>
ceteris paribus; and that X on the margin is beyond some consumers,<br/>
and can be as high as another $75 if it is the only letterbox in their<br/>
universe that requires a GPS unit to find.  Even if the $75 for the<br/>
GPS unit _can_ be amortized, it is not irrational to forgo that<br/>
upfront cost if one is on a budget, and has no means, prima facie,<br/>
to amortize it.<br/>
<br/>
All the economics BS aside, I can look at this problem from my<br/>
perspective.  I own, and use, and old Garmin 12X for letterboxing.<br/>
However, when that unit fails, I will not replace it.  I am not<br/>
afraid of the "technology" (obviously, since I am already comfortable<br/>
using the unit (and its not "technology", its like using a toaster),<br/>
nor am I "not interested" (obviously, because within the last 3<br/>
months, I used the unit to create an outdoor puzzle).  I am 100%<br/>
motivated by the cost of replacing the unit in refusing to replace<br/>
it.  I don't have alot of money, and if I had a disposable $75,<br/>
would rather take my family out to dinner than buy a GPS unit.<br/>
<br/>
Any other practitioners of the dismal science on the list want to<br/>
debate this thread, bring it on :-)<br/>
<br/>
Well, my earlier deleted post was much more elegant than this one, but<br/>
this one gets the job done of killing the thread.  Silversun Pickups<br/>
are playing now, and it is time to go.  (If anyone can name a better<br/>
modern band, bring it on :-) (Sum 41 doesn't count))<br/>

 &gt;I discussed the idea at length on the AQ boards, and<br/>
 &gt;everyone -- simply EVERYONE -- told me there is nothing anywhere that<br/>
 &gt;says a letterbox cannot involve using a GPS to find.<br/>
<br/>
 From what I've seen of the AQ boards, it appears to be mostly newbies<br/>
  patting each other on the back about having an icon of a cake pop up<br/>
 next to their names and other such drivel. I wouldn't consider it a<br/>
 source to be taken seriously.<br/>
<br/>
 On the other hand, you are right, there is nothing that says you<br/>
 can't clue your boxes in this way. Kind of takes away from the spirit<br/>
 of the whole thing though, I think.<br/>

[LbNA] Re: Concise Directions<br/>
<br/>
 &gt;I discussed the idea at length on the AQ boards, and<br/>
 &gt;everyone -- simply EVERYONE -- told me there is nothing anywhere that<br/>
 &gt;says a letterbox cannot involve using a GPS to find.<br/>
<br/>
 From what I've seen of the AQ boards, it appears to be mostly newbies<br/>
  patting each other on the back about having an icon of a cake pop up<br/>
 next to their names and other such drivel. I wouldn't consider it a<br/>
 source to be taken seriously.<br/>
<br/>
 On the other hand, you are right, there is nothing that says you<br/>
 can't clue your boxes in this way. Kind of takes away from the spirit<br/>
 of the whole thing though, I think.<br/>
