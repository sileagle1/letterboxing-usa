Let me know what else you need for info (if I recall, you listed folks interests...mine are hiking, dancing the Lindy, sewing reproduction historic clothing, and sea kayaking).  <br/>

Well, I carved my first stamp last night and am very pleased with the results, even if it was so hard because the eraser was so small!  Now I have to plant it.  Graham has asked for first finder's claim, so I geuss I won't publicize the clues for this one until later in the spring--but I figure if someone should find it before Graham, that's fair game.  Now I have to figure out where to put out my next stamp.<br/>
