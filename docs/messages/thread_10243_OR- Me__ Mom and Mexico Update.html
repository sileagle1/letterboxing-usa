Well the sun was not shining in West Lynn and those that searched for the boxes in the Park were right! There are two missing. However I did replace one of them for the future in hopes it will not go for a walk again. Box Number 5 is gone and will not be replaced. The Chicken Pox tree and his friend are too open for a box to hide safely.<br/>
<br/>
Also I would like to change the clues to box 7. It appears when the leaves are gone there are too many picnic tables in plain view for the clue to be effective. Therefore, the new clue is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
After grabbing box 6 turn right around and go SE. From the water tap go 6.5 paces to the right. Then take a reading of approx. 220/225 degrees. In the distance you will find box 7 beneath a real mess of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!!<br/>
<br/>
PS I checked on the Sigfred and Roy Baby box and it is alive and well. Only 5 visiters though....Funhog, Ryan, Amanda and the Pirates folks off the top of my head.....Cheers<br/>
