Do you live on the coast?  I lived in Yachats up until 2 years ago <br/>
and I was curious as to whether you have checked out Cape Perpetua as <br/>
a place to hide boxes.  We are planning on moving back when we can <br/>
(my husband is in the Navy so it might be a while)and would love to <br/>
see more boxes on the coast.  Let me know if you've been to Cape <br/>
Perpetua....could be a promising area!<br/>

<br/>
No, I live in Hillsboro.  (I use the term 'live' very loosely at this <br/>
point seeing as I'm actually homeless and currently in Honduras!)  I <br/>
just drove down the coast along Highway 101 since I had never seen <br/>
that part of the world before.  =)<br/>

I did stop there briefly, and I think it's a great place to hide a <br/>
box!  =)  I did hide a box at a lighthouse just north of that area.  <br/>
(Heceta Head?  Now my whole trip is starting to blur....)<br/>
<br/>
The Oregon Coast definitely needs more letterboxes, though.  When I <br/>
hide more than I placed, I know there's not enough to look for!  =)<br/>
