<br/>
Golden Ears is one of the largest provincial parks in British Columbia,<br/>
encompassing an incredible 55,590 hectares of mostly undeveloped<br/>
wilderness.  It is also one of, and possibly the most popular park in<br/>
the province.  The park was named after the twin peaks of Mount<br/>
Blanshard, which shine gold from the setting winter sun.  Golden Ears<br/>
lies in the Coast Mountains, north of the mighty Fraser River.  It<br/>
extends 55km north through untamed mountain wilderness to an<br/>
impenetrable barrier of mountain peaks and steep-sided valleys that<br/>
separate it from Garibaldi Provincial Park.  Second-growth forests of<br/>
western hemlock, western red cedar, and Douglas fir cover much of the<br/>
landscape.  At higher elevations, forests give way to alpine meadows<br/>
and, at even higher elevations, permanent snowfields.<br/>
<br/>
Once at the Park, enjoy the scenic drive until you reach and cross over<br/>
the bridge at Gold Creek. If the North Beach campground is open, turn<br/>
right and drive to the Visitor parking. If the campground is closed, you<br/>
will have to park on the left, at the trail parking lot and walk from<br/>
the yellow gate to the visitor parking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The first box you seek is the home of "Park Pooch". From the visitor<br/>
parking, walk into the campground and stop at the Information Kiosk.<br/>
Check the map to find the gate that is between sites #20 and #21.  When<br/>
you get there, follow the trail from the gate, down, towards North<br/>
Beach. Very shortly you will come to a notice forbidding you to light<br/>
fires - with your back to this sign, facing down the trail at 120', spot<br/>
a huge moss covered giant on the south side of the trail. When the Pooch<br/>
arrived there, he turned left to explore the twisted and gnarled root<br/>
before sensing a comfortable spot at 10:00 from the huge root. You will<br/>
find him there, left of a Hemlock and beneath a stone. Take care you<br/>
don't slip!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Back on the trail, still heading for the lake, you'll be chasing a<br/>
"wabbit", also known as "Golden Ears ". Keeping to the main trail till<br/>
you reach a clearing, circle around the old water pump and give it a try<br/>
before proceeding over to read the information on the Renewable Energy<br/>
in Golden Ears Provincial Park. Stop at the Long House, knock on the<br/>
door and say Hello! Before heading over to the wood shack. From here you<br/>
will spot a huge stump quite close, line this stump up with a moss<br/>
covered rock below and to the right, with another stump on the hill. "<br/>
Golden Ears " is in his rabbit hole beneath.<br/>
