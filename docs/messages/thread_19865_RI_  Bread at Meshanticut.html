I went to check on "Bread" (my first plant containing my first hand <br/>
carved stamp) today and I could see the open, wet Rubbermaid from 30 <br/>
feet away.  The stamp is gone and the logbook is moldy.  So, for <br/>
now, I've pulled the box.  I haven't decided whether to re-carve and <br/>
re-plant somewhere else nearby or to give it up!<br/>
<br/>
It is sad when a box dies *sniff*<br/>

I have not yet had the unfortunate experience to loose one of my <br/>
boxes.  Yet I can understand it takes a lot of work and faith to put <br/>
out a box, and hope other boxers will come and enjoy it.  Continue <br/>
to plant and hope, and other boxes will survive.<br/>
