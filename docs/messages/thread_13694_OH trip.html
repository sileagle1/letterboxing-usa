Just heard from Wanda.  She's on her way home with muddy <br/>
boots and a broken tooth after several days of letterboxing in <br/>
Ohio, starting with her first Ohio box on Saturday and the Miami <br/>
Whitewater gathering on Sunday.  Then she had a couple of fun <br/>
days letterboxing with ScoutDogs, including an exchange with <br/>
Wild Woman and Wild Child at the Cincinnati airport on Tuesday.  <br/>
Yesterday she started heading back east , and found 30 boxes in <br/>
one day, including her 100th in Ohio and 2700th overall!  Looks <br/>
like Mansfield, CT is getting some competition for letterbox <br/>
abundance not only from areas like Portland, OR and greater <br/>
DC, but also the greater Cincinnati area!<br/>
<br/>
Pete<br/>
looking forward to Wanda's return<br/>

letterboxing Mecca status yet...  Well, at least we tried. I suppose <br/>
it's all that rain we don't get. ;)  Hope Wanda's doing well despite <br/>
the broken tooth.  Sounds like she had a successful 'boxing trip <br/>
nonetheless.  I think we racked up around 35 letterboxes in <br/>
Cincinnati on a 2 day l'boxing binge back in November.  Gotta love <br/>
it.  <br/>

PS  I heard on the radio today that this year DC has already <br/>
received nine times the amount of rain that Seattle has!!!  Who <br/>
knew???  ;)  I'll have to find those stats to see for myself...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the up date Pete. I was wondering if she was able to continue<br/>
boxing. To clarify, I did show her some karate moves, but I did NOT break<br/>
her tooth <big grin=""> Hope she has a safe and boxious trip home, I really had<br/>
a great time letterboxing with her. I think Splash cat misses her company<br/>
