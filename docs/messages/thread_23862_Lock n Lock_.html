 Central New York is Lock n Lock territory! I have planted over 200<br/>
boxes with the majority of those being packed inside Lock n Locks and<br/>
I have only had one failure. Someone somehow managed to break off one<br/>
flap! No worries...I use it in my pack now to carry those little<br/>
square ink pads.<br/>
<br/>
Our grocery stores seem to rotate this product in and out. Wegman's is<br/>
currently carrying it, as well as Price Chopper. A few price choppers<br/>
are even discounting it as they reach certain sales levels. (says the<br/>
manager of my local store)  P &amp; C seems to jump in with product around<br/>
the Thanksgiving holidays. If only they knew how many boxes weren't<br/>
going to be holding leftovers! lol <br/>

Yes, I was wondering about the flaps, how sturdy they are.<br/>
