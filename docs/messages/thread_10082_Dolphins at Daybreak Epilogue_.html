Point and searching for the two letterboxes there.  We were unable <br/>
to find the notebook containing all the stamps Jessica had <br/>
discovered.  We believe we found the cluster of low rocks that Dirk <br/>
saw but did not find anything. Has he retrieved it unbeknownst to <br/>
us?  The first box was there and in good shape. Even the quahogger <br/>
was there!  Thanks for any info.<br/>
