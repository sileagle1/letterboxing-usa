<div>Are all these infected attachments driving everyone 
else nuts?!?  My mailbox is filled with messages that I can't even 
delete.  I've been trying to get on the site to stop having e-mails sent, 
but with no success.  Is anyone else having trouble accessing letterboxing. 
org?  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Although I am guilty myself of sending my clues as 
attachments, I am ready to vote NO to accepting attachments.</div>

                    <html><body><div><div>     If putting text based clues in the body of an email makes it easier on the Webmasters, then it seems to be a matter of etiquette that people adhere to this principle.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>     I have been experimenting with visual clue forms of late, and have sent my last three to the list in the form of attached jpegs.  I have two more in the workshop at the moment that have visual clues, and they will be posted in the near future.  The <em>Kmartha</em> prank would have lost something had I not been able to attach a copy of her personal stamp image.  In short, I view this medium as a most valuable tool, and would hate to see it taken away.  Besides, isn't the occasional treed woodchuck picture worth something?  Removing the attachement option may lessen your exposure to viruses, but only from this source.  A better solution is to install virus protection software on your computer, <u>and update it every few weeks by downloading the periodic addenda.</u>  Although this isn't foolproof, it works quite well, and is only prudent given the kind of virtual skank making the rounds in the e-world.  </div>
