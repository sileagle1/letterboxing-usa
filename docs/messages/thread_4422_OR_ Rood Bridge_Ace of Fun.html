<br/>
This Rood Bridge box really sounds like something I'm going to have to<br/>
hunt down!  From what I gather from the discussion, I would probably<br/>
inadvertantly count it as three boxes, too, assuming that the logbooks<br/>
were taken or whatever else.  I get confused easily, anyway.  Sounds<br/>
like Rood Bridge will be a wonderful adventure (if I'm not too dense to<br/>
find it).<br/>
<br/>
Also...I know what you're talking about regarding the mystery boxes.<br/>
This wouldn't even be an issue if it weren't for Big Mouth Amanda, The<br/>
Paisley Orca -- not to be confused with the beautiful and discreet<br/>
Amanda from Seattle.  Hey Ryan!!!  Can I please see your logbook again,<br/>
After, of course, duct tape has been securely applied to my lips!<br/>
<br/>
I don't get to letterbox this weekend since I've got relatives galore in<br/>
town and the main event in our family is eating and visiting<br/>
EXCESSIVELY!  I may get to take a hike this afternoon with my cousin,<br/>
Lori, up to Triple Falls, but since I've already got that stamp I can't<br/>
count a second excursion to the letterbox as a find.  Maybe a hitchhiker<br/>
can visit it and stamp in, though...<br/>
<br/>
Rumor has it someone else will be out seeking a certain new letterbox in<br/>
the African Safari series today.  Lucky him!  <br/>
<br/>
I am sorry that the slough series except for box 5 is out of commission.<br/>
I will try to get the rest of that series in new boxes, with new<br/>
logbooks (where applicable) and place them in new locations on land.<br/>
Then I will beg and plead Der Mad Stamper to yank the stale clues and<br/>
put the new ones on the web site.  Box 6 will probably go back right<br/>
where it was before -- Yes, Ryan, you were definitely at the right<br/>
place, I'm certain.  If the box hadn't been critter-chewed and full of<br/>
water I would have left it there. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...Sounds like I need to get some more out there.  Ryan has<br/>
exhausted the Portland area letterboxes that are out there and I've got<br/>
some good ideas for new boxes and stamps that I really want to place.<br/>
We now have a good number of people seeking and placing in the Pacific<br/>
NW, so it's time for me to get busy placing (and replacing) again.  I<br/>
sure appreciate Ryan, Amanda, Mark, Beth, Funhog, Travelling Circus,<br/>
Mischief, Glenn and Bill, Catbird and Lizard(?) and Candlelight, and<br/>
anyone else I missed, for jumping in and making letterboxing so exciting<br/>
these days.  Not to mention Mitch Klink, Thom Cheney and Cara for<br/>
totally getting the ball rolling out here back in the very beginning of<br/>
the North American Letterboxing gold rush!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

It really is a lovely, lovely stamp whether you count it as 1 or 3!<br/>
<br/>
And the "clues" are very clever as well.  It looks like a brand new <br/>
park in Hillsboro! <br/>
<br/>
I am currently checking out parks in Montreal, Quebec (where I am <br/>
spending every Tuesday this month) If I can get under all this snow, <br/>
I may be able to plant a box here sometime this month. :-)<br/>
<br/>
As for Ace of Fun!  It was wonderful fun figuring out the clues to <br/>
this mystery box.  I was very excited when I finally figured it out!  <br/>
And I have every confidence that you could do it too Amanda B!!<br/>

(and Nancy Drew fanatic :-)I'm going to another convention in Iowa in <br/>
April (look for more boxes planted there then!! )<br/>
