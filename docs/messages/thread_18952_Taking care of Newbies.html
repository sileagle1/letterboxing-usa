                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's a suggestion for further thought:<br/>
<br/>
Now that there are letterboxers in each state, some states with many <br/>
letterboxers and some wishing for more, and each with thier own <br/>
regional nuances, I would suggest that when the new site goes up, we <br/>
have a page that lists "state letterboxing ambassadors" or <br/>
a "contact a local letterboxer" page that newbies in a particular <br/>
state could/should use for more information on letterboxing in <br/>
general and in the particular area/state.  That way their questions <br/>
would be directed to someone with an inherent interest in answering <br/>
them, and the ambassador/contact could also help them get introduced <br/>
to the local and national letterboxing community.<br/>
<br/>
This idea came to mind because I personally seem to have become the <br/>
WI letterboxing ambassador without much effort.  I have had a number <br/>
of recent WI newbies contact me personally for information about <br/>
letterboxing in WI and in general, just from them finding my email <br/>
address on my clue pages.  (I'm sure this has happened to other <br/>
letterboxers as well, and I'm not alone.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when starting something new all one needs is a new friend <br/>
or a mentor to see them through.<br/>
<br/>
If this come to be, I volunteer to be the WI contact/ambassador.<br/>

Hey, no one ever got my Sly and the Family Stone reference either.<br/>

"You can make it if you try" was by Sly, but not as popular as "I wnat to take you higher"<br/>

Thanks to Silent Doug for his concise and informative explanation of postal letterboxes! If you want to sign up for one of She Who Plants' PLBs in the future, watch for her announcements on the postal_letterboxing group site! That's where they'll turn up! ;-)<br/>
