&gt;                        THE GREAT TREE ADVENTURE<br/>
&gt; Where: Wallingford Ct.<br/>
&gt; Number of boxes : 3<br/>
&gt; Placed by Butterfly on April 10, 2002<br/>
&gt; Hike Distance : under 2 miles<br/>
&gt; Difficulty : An Easy lollipop with one steep climb.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ** Directions : from I91- traveling to the north, exit 14 onto Woodhouse<br/>
Ave<br/>
&gt; [rt. 150 ] Turn left and at the first traffic light, turn right [Airline<br/>
&gt; Rd.] At the next traffic light, turn right onto Center Street and proceed<br/>
&gt; over I91, and then the railroad tracks and pass the Veteran Memorial<br/>
soccer<br/>
&gt; fields. Turn right at the next road [North Branford Rd.] and then right<br/>
&gt; again very soon onto Tyler Mill Road. [hard to see the road sign.] Park in<br/>
&gt; the parking lot just to your left.<br/>
&gt; **from I91 -traveling to the south, exit 14 [Center St ] turn left and<br/>
&gt; proceed over I91 and rail road tracks and pass the Veteran Memorial<br/>
Fields.<br/>
&gt; Turn right at the next road [North Branford Rd ] and right again very soon<br/>
&gt; onto Tyler Mill Road ~~[hard to see the road sign.] Park in the parking<br/>
lot<br/>
&gt; just to you left.<br/>
&gt;                        The GREAT TREE HIKE<br/>
&gt; Orange is the fashion color in season.<br/>
&gt; This hike is in the Tyler Mill Open Space Area,  on the other side of the<br/>
&gt; Muddy River from the Morris Rock Vista Hike . On this hike there are many<br/>
&gt; lovely GREAT TREES, It is a hike for all seasons. Spring finds the land<br/>
&gt; painted creamy white with Dutchman's Britches and other wildflowers.<br/>
Summer<br/>
&gt; finds the hawks soaring with children's kites. Bikers and horses also use<br/>
&gt; the trails. Winter snows bring out the snowshoes and cross country skis.<br/>
&gt; Begin the hike by walking west on the paved road and notice the first<br/>
GREAT<br/>
&gt; TREES are the sugar maples on your right. Off on the left is the Muddy<br/>
River<br/>
&gt; that bisects the Tyler Mill Open Space.<br/>
&gt; Soon a trap rock ridge becomes evident on your right.. Watch for a heap of<br/>
&gt; pavement on the right opposite a small cleared parking space. This is the<br/>
&gt; start of the blue trail and a blue blaze is faintly showing on a hunk of<br/>
&gt; pavement in the pile. Turn right into the woods and begin a gentle climb<br/>
&gt; into a hemlock grove. Cross over an unmarked path and continue on the blue<br/>
&gt; trail, dipping down and coming to a 'Y' intersection with a red trail.<br/>
There<br/>
&gt; is a  GREAT three sister OAK TREE at the intersection on your right. Turn<br/>
&gt; left continuing on the blue trail that has now joined up with the red.<br/>
&gt; Proceed up hill twisting and turning through a Cedar grove coming out of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; grove as the Red trail meets another trail going right into a field. At<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; intersection, turn back into the woods going left uphill on the red blazed<br/>
&gt; trail. Soon two more GREAT TREES come into view. Notice the GREAT BEECH<br/>
TREE<br/>
&gt; on your left and the GREAT sugar MAPLE TREE on your right. The best is yet<br/>
&gt; to come !! Climb a short steep hill traveled by many bikers, and at the<br/>
top<br/>
&gt; pass by an unmarked trail on your right .  Now notice several GREAT TREES<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; your left, but the GREAT WOLF BEECH TREE on the left is the one to find.<br/>
&gt; Take time to look at this 'living' Totem Pole and think of all it has<br/>
seen.<br/>
&gt; According to the Park Nature Book, the many 'babies' around this Wolf tree<br/>
&gt; have not grown from seeds, but are true clones coming up from the GREAT<br/>
&gt; Tree's  roots. Stand with your back to the Wolf Tree and take a reading of<br/>
&gt; 320 degrees. Follow that about 10 feet off trail to a Cedar tree. the<br/>
GREAT<br/>
&gt; WOLF TREE letterbox treasure is there. Stamp in and carefully seal and<br/>
hide<br/>
&gt; again.<br/>
&gt; Return back to the Red trail and retrace back about 50 feet to the<br/>
unmarked<br/>
&gt; trail now on your left. It is well traveled and goes up in a NE direction<br/>
,<br/>
&gt; soon going steeply down. At the bottom of the hill watch carefully and<br/>
turn<br/>
&gt; right [east] onto an unmarked trail --just before a white blazed trail.<br/>
On<br/>
&gt; this unmarked trail notice a field is on your left. Soon the trail crossed<br/>
&gt; over a stone wall and now take notice of the trap rock hill on your right.<br/>
&gt; The trail curves right and then crosses the stone wall again. go right<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; six big steps along the wall and find the Trap Rock Hill Letterbox in a<br/>
rock<br/>
&gt; hole along the side of the wall covered by a rock with a "handle" Stamp in<br/>
&gt; and place the box carefully back. Continue up hill through the woods and<br/>
&gt; meet up with the Red trail again. Turn left, east, and soon notice your<br/>
old<br/>
&gt; friends the GREAT TREES , now on opposite sides of the trail !! When the<br/>
Red<br/>
&gt; trail meets the junction at the field, turn left now out into the open<br/>
&gt; field. Enjoy the views of the soccer fields below and a great place to fly<br/>
&gt; kites. Look for the Go Fly A Kite Letter box by walking left into the<br/>
field<br/>
&gt; and left along the woods about 22 paces to large quartz rock. The Treasure<br/>
&gt; is south of the bolder at the feet of a GREAT PINE TREE . Stamp in and<br/>
&gt; carefully return the box to it's hiding place. Return to the Red/Blue<br/>
Trail<br/>
&gt; and proceed down through the Cedar grove to the intersection where the<br/>
GREAT<br/>
&gt; three Sister OAK TREE stands and turn right, south onto the blue trail and<br/>
&gt; back to the park road then left to your car. I hope you have enjoyed the<br/>
&gt; GREAT TREES of Tyler Mill.<br/>

It is quite helpful to the webmasters to have the state inserted at the<br/>
beginning of the subject line if clues are being submitted. If not, there is<br/>
a good chance that the posting request will be overlooked. We each have<br/>
states for which we are responsible, and not always a whole lot of time to<br/>
peruse all the postings thoroughly.<br/>
