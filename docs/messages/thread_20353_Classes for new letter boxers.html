letterboxers.  I must have deleted the original but taking clues form the<br/>
responses of all of you I am taking a guess although many were titled <br/>
letterboxing on the radio What is that all about?<br/>
<br/>
If someone were offering classes I would send my kids!   Good activity and<br/>
maybe they would get into it and spend more time being creative.  I think a<br/>
class on how to write great clues would be great along with actually hiding<br/>
one with a the group in the class.  Break into teams each team hides a box<br/>
and then gives the other team the clues.  Of course it would be an all day<br/>
class with lunch included.  And it should cost more like $25.00 per kid.<br/>
That is a bargain.   My husband and I could get away!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>
