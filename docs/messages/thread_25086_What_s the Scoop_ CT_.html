Mountain Girl (she'll always be Just Beth to me) has done a stupendous job making this a unigue ice cream parlor. Even the boys reveled in the decor.  When you get hot and tired this summer or you're just passing through, stop in to see this place and get the box. You won't be disappointed.<br/>

p.s. I had a sugar free butter pecan that was so good, I suspected Beth was pulling a hoax on me.<br/>
