with respect to the Time article/etc, the newbies who are here and <br/>
reading this are not the ones who are the issue/problem.  I don't <br/>
want any of the new people here to think that we aren't glad that <br/>
they are here, because they are the ones that are taking the time to <br/>
join the list, and read up on the hobby and are the responsible <br/>
letterboxers.  The ones who just read the article and look up some <br/>
clues to go "check it out" without studying up are the ones who are <br/>
causing the problems.  So, if you are a newbie here as a result of <br/>
the Time article, welcome and we're glad to have you...don't take <br/>
this discussion personally.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Though I rarely post, I wanted to respond to your concerns about <br/>
&gt; publicity because your posts over the years have always been <br/>
&gt; respectful of others, cogent and thoughtfully written.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was involved with the "Time" reporter and article. Like you, I <br/>
&gt; hestitated about doing this at all. I exchanged emails with the <br/>
&gt; others who were mentioned, all veteran letterboxers, and, I think <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; can speak for all involved. We felt that if we didn't do this and <br/>
&gt; emphasize the traditions associated with the game, the wrong <br/>
&gt; impression would have been given to the reading public and, sadly, <br/>
&gt; even more letterboxes would go missing. Doing this was truly a <br/>
double <br/>
&gt; edged sword. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Further, we invited the writer of the piece, Deirdre Van Dyk, to <br/>
&gt; Connecticut to letterbox with those of us in the East who had done <br/>
&gt; phone interviews with her. Deirdre graciously gave up her one day <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; week off and joined us. Before we set one foot on a trail, we sat <br/>
&gt; with her at lunch and discussed in great detail the nuances of the <br/>
&gt; game and how playing it runs along a continuum from complete <br/>
stealth <br/>
&gt; and anonymity to others who are much more open. Incidentally, in <br/>
&gt; advance of Deridre's coming to Connecticut and writing the piece, <br/>
she <br/>
&gt; read Randy Hall's book. Most of us had several telephone <br/>
&gt; conversations with her and we emailed back and forth constantly <br/>
&gt; because she was committed to painting as accurate a picture as she <br/>
&gt; could. Shortly before publication, her editor reduced her allotted <br/>
&gt; space to 99 lines so she had to cut quite a bit of content from <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; piece. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While we all were letterboxing with Deirdre, we happened upon some <br/>
&gt; technical scenarios that, I feel, helped her understand how the <br/>
game <br/>
&gt; is played and some of the issues we all face and discuss on the <br/>
talk-<br/>
&gt; lists. We came upon a poorly hidden letterbox, some clues that <br/>
were <br/>
&gt; written in such a way as to cause undesirable impact to the <br/>
&gt; environment and a box hidden in plain sight of a family gathering <br/>
&gt; that we decided to pass on. We took the time to point these things <br/>
&gt; out to her and I feel she achieved a more balanced perspective <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; most letterboxers are sensitive to the environment and LNT, are <br/>
&gt; thoughtful and respectful people who would pass up a letterbox <br/>
rather <br/>
&gt; than compromise its location to non-boxers. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whether the piece was 99 lines or 9 pages, it would have attracted <br/>
&gt; people to our beloved game who had both good and bad intentions,  <br/>
&gt; some who will stay and become great and interesting players or <br/>
others <br/>
&gt; who will try it, lose interest and fade away. In that regard, if <br/>
&gt; the "Time" article was to happen at all, ironically, we probably <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; the writer's editor to thank for preventing too much from being <br/>
&gt; written about it. The downside is that regional media sources who <br/>
&gt; picked up on the piece are now clammoring for their own spin, as <br/>
many <br/>
&gt; of you have already found out. Best kept secrets aren't secrets <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; very long.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think we are all saddened by the loss of a letterbox, <br/>
particularly <br/>
&gt; when it happens at the hand of man. While art is ephemeral, it <br/>
still <br/>
&gt; smarts and makes us ask why anyone would be so thoughtless. This <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; one reason so many of us harp "ad nauseum" on the importance of <br/>
&gt; rehiding a box carefully and making good choices about hiding <br/>
spots. <br/>
&gt; These things need to be reiterated over and over somewhere so that <br/>
&gt; those who are new to the game of letterboxing follow on with <br/>
respect <br/>
&gt; for the efforts by and hard work from every boxer who preceded <br/>
them. <br/>
&gt; It's also just one reason why so many of us are not publishing our <br/>
&gt; clues any longer and making them WOM. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your comment about media people having their own agendas is <br/>
true.The <br/>
&gt; nature of the press is that, in theory, it may strive for balance, <br/>
&gt; but the end result is always presented with a point of view. It <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; extremely important for those of us who were involved with "Time" <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; make sure that the article was as balanced as it could be. If it <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; to happen at all, I, for one, am thankful to have worked with a <br/>
&gt; reporter who was generous of herself and her time, understood our <br/>
&gt; delimma and attempted to write about letterboxing as fairly as <br/>
&gt; possible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don and Gwen, I am very sorry for the loss of your letterboxes.<br/>
