                    <html><body>Orion the Hunter will be easy to find with the snow cover, as will Egypt Explorer and Year of the Ram.  If you are very observant on where snow has been unearthed, you will also find The Inventor and Skull and Bones (I packed the snow back into the spots that I dug out.... however, those places look a little different than the places where the snow hasn't been touched ;-)
<br/>
<br/>When I was there last week, the sidewalks going through the entire Mall area were not shoveled, so you may need to walk around the outside until you find a street intersecting the Mall (most of the time, those sidewalks are shoveled).... unless you are wearing waterproof boots and don't mind getting your feet wet.....

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ooops, uh wellll...we have snow.  In fact we are getting more right <br/>
now.  Schools are closed tomorrow.  By Sunday, who knows.  A lot of <br/>
the snow downtown that Music Woman encountered was mostly melted by <br/>
yesterday.  It all depends on the temperatures between now and Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
The mall circuit includes Smithsonian (if it's still there, not heard <br/>
for sure on that one), Orion, Independence, the Inventor, Skull and <br/>
Bones, and Mr. Jefferson.  You can make a circle in that order.  I'd <br/>
take a taxi from Smithsonian to Orion and start your walk from <br/>
there.  Understand that the mall is a desert, a veritable wasteland <br/>
lacking in amenties like stores and eateries.  Especially down by <br/>
Lincoln you can think you're in the middle of a forest.  But at least <br/>
you are walking around one cool toursit site after another in tourist <br/>
land, and you said you wanted to tourist.  Walk through the Korean <br/>
War Memorial and commmisserate with the statues of cold looking <br/>
soldiers.  <br/>
<br/>
Independence and Jefferson are in cute tiny little boxes hard to find <br/>
under snow.  But I understand someone recently found Independence and <br/>
baggied it so maybe it wouldn't be so hard.  <br/>
<br/>
Taft is a film cannister lying on the roots of a tree.  Again, <br/>
depends on how much snow is left.  <br/>
<br/>
Year of the Ram, Chinatown is up off the ground (hint, hint).  It's a <br/>
Holiday is a short metro ride, all indoors, to Pentagon City Mall <br/>
just across the river in VA.  It has a big atrium food court.  Egypt <br/>
Explorer is off the Mall path, and way public scary, but at National <br/>
Geographic which is pretty cool.  <br/>
<br/>
The next question is where you are staying, if you are in or outside <br/>
the city and if you have a car.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to meet up with you on Monday or Tuesday for lunch and <br/>
exchange since I work downtown.  Write me at <br/>

boots for around $45 - Cabella wants $65 clearance for the same ones.  I 
also got some really good socks, glove liners, and nice long underwear from 
Sportsman Guide.  Only a serious LB will spend so much to go trumping

<p>Who had a wonderful time driving in the morning rush yesterday, slipping 
  and sliding on the snow over ice, finally arriving at school only to be told 
  they were closing early!?!    </p></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>You know you've had too many snow days when your kids wake up and moan 
  because there is no school!  They just got back to seeing their 
  friends.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Is there any store that still has winter stuff (aka waterproof mittens or a 
  shovel?).  It doesn't help to finally get into Kohls (after they've fixed 
  their roof damage) and look at all the cute tankinis (ok -- well, they are 
  cute) when what I really need is a big puffy parka with a hood to keep my ears 
  from falling off when clear the driveway (again!).  I'd bet any store 
  with winter supplies would make a mint right now!  </p>
<p>Not to mention -- we haven't been able to search for a box or check our own 
  in weeks!  My folder of boxes to seek is so nice and plump!  
  Unfortunately, so is my but (what else can you do after you shovel but reward 
  yourself with some great chocolatey HoHo's to reenergize?...)  Big 
  mistake, letting the kids try them -- bigger mistake-- that is was for 
  breakfast day four of the big snow in....  It's not so much the 
  nutritional havoc, mind you, but now there are fewer for me -- Oh My!  
  Forget the great hiding places for the boxes....where can I stash my 
  chocolate?!...</p>

<p>I love snow too but am looking forward to placing another box when this snow melts.  Although I did get one of my boxes placed before the last snow.  Now its finding some good hills to go sleding on :^) letterboxing only 1/2 on the mind.</p>
