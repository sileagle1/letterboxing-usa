Unless someone knows that a box is no longer in place or is ruined, <br/>
why not let people hunt for it.<br/>

That is the problem, and numerous folks have stated that the boxes <br/>
or stamps are missing and the owners are no longer available. Why <br/>
put the clues out there again? The webmasters don't know which clues <br/>
are missing boxes and who has left the letterboxing game. Yes, they <br/>
do know the famous or unique ones because these clues and/or stamps <br/>
are talked on this list.<br/>
<br/>
I am just curious.:) <br/>

If there is truly talk on the list that a box is missing, then, I feel as <br/>
though a tag can be placed on the clues by the moderators that it may be <br/>
missing.  That way, if someone really wants to go and find the box, they <br/>
still can, but are warned that it may be missing.  From what I hear, there <br/>
was a box tagged as missing, then was surprisingly found come April.<br/>
