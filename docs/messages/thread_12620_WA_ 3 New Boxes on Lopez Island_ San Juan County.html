to the San Juan Islands this weekend and took the oportunity to <br/>
do some letterbox maintenance and place some new boxes too.  <br/>
<br/>
We are happy to declare that our first 2 Agate Beach boxes are <br/>
alive and well and have recieved a total of 1 visitor each!!  A <br/>
group of elementary school girls stumbled upon one of our <br/>
boxes  back in February of this year and took it to their adult <br/>
leader.  The girls, and leader, later returned with a stamp and <br/>
signed in.  New converts!!!<br/>
<br/>
While there, we relocated one of the boxes to a better hiding area <br/>
and modified the clues to make them more descript so that <br/>
Fudrick can actually find them on his next trip up there.  We also <br/>
placed 2 more boxes at this lovely location to try to draw more <br/>
people there.  Hopefully 4 boxes at one small park on Lopez will <br/>
be attractive enough to get people out there.<br/>
<br/>
On the way back to Anacortes we were blessed with some extra <br/>
Island Time when we (and about 100 other travelers) had to wait <br/>
thru 3 ferries to board back for the mainland.  An extra 2 1/2 <br/>
hours on Lopez!!! Yeehawww!  Just enough time to carve another <br/>
stamp and find a suitable hiding spot near the ferry terminal for <br/>
bored travelers to find in the future.  <br/>
<br/>
See the clues to all the boxes on the new LBNA site.<br/>

Happy Boxing,<br/>
