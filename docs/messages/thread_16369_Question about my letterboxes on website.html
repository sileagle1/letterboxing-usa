is a County in Colorado that is listed with another part of the <br/>
state. This results in them showing up with boxes that are 300 miles <br/>
away. I am not sure how this will effect the possibility of them <br/>
getting visited. Either I am just not getting through to the site or <br/>
Wes is just too busy. Oh well.<br/>
