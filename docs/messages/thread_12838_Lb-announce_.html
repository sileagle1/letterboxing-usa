&gt;Hey there!<br/>
&gt;Your message probably DID get sent, it just doesn't come to the<br/>
&gt;letterbox-usa message board.  It comes to the letterbox-announce message<br/>
&gt;board.  To sign onto that board (and get announcements when boxes are<br/>
&gt;planted) just visit  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-announce<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Of course, you can also manually list your boxes here as well!  :)  Also -<br/>
&gt;my advice is to sign up for the "digest" version of the announcement group.<br/>
&gt;The digest sends basically one email per day, with a compilation of all the<br/>
&gt;messages.  Then just scroll through the list to see if any are planted in<br/>
&gt;your state (and you don't need to bother reading and/or deleting a lot of<br/>
&gt;other stuff!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope that helps!<br/>

When I clicked on the link, Yahoo said "there is no group called<br/>
letterbox-announce". Could I have done something incorrectly?<br/>
