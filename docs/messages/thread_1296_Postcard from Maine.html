Postcard from Maine<br/>
<br/>
Dear Mom &amp; Dad,<br/>
<br/>
Having a great time in South Portland, Maine! We found this terrific <br/>
shoreside walk that is perfect for both us and the kids. We have <br/>
beautiful views of Casco Bay and two lighthouses while the children <br/>
can explore an old fort and play on four different playgrounds! Here <br/>
are directions for when you come up next weekend to share the cottage <br/>
with us:<br/>
<br/>
On I-95, take exit 6A (toll) and immediately take I-295 exit 1. <br/>
Follow it down to Rte. 1 and turn left on Rte. 1 North. Follow it 1.1 <br/>
miles, past the fire station, and turn right on Broadway. Follow it <br/>
carefully to the end after 3.6 miles (don't miss the sharp right turn <br/>
near Wendy's). At the end of Broadway, turn right on Pickett St, then <br/>
left at a stop sign onto the SMTC campus. Follow this road to the end <br/>
and park at the museum.<br/>
<br/>
We couldn't resist walking out the causeway to explore the lighthouse <br/>
and get a close up of the harbor. Then we took a gray wooden <br/>
staircase behind the museum up to the walkway. This wonderful trail <br/>
kept the bay to our left: we walked down on the beach and back home <br/>
on the shore. We walked down to the end of the campus and then <br/>
crossed the sandy crescent of Willard's Beach. At the far end, we <br/>
climbed the stairs and turned left out to the point. There are a <br/>
couple of photogenic fisherman's shanties. At the easternmost of the <br/>
fisherman's shacks, we hid a letterbox for you. It is tucked into the <br/>
foundation in the southeast corner of the shanty: please re-hide it <br/>
carefully in this busy and windy/wavy area. On the way home we had <br/>
the prevailing wind at our back and really came to understand what is <br/>
meant by "down east."<br/>
<br/>
Wish you were here!<br/>

#199: it took awhile to get written up. We're cooking up something <br/>
really special for the bicentennial effort in our ongoing illiterate <br/>
literary series; a Mexican soap opera in the style of Gabriel Garcia <br/>
Marquez. My spanish is awful so I'm hoping my middle schooler will <br/>
translate...<br/>

<div>You'll note that the location, though high on the beach, is still in the inter-tidal zone.  I'll be clever enough to take this one up over the winter.</div>

<div>Here's one more, just to make sure no one goes home skunked.  Please (Perscitus Magister)post this one on the LBNA site, and also, please link it and West Quoddy Head to the lighthouse/letterbox site:</div>
