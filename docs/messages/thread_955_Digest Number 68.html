You are right about the Wheaton dot. I did not realize there was a more detailed map. That is way cool. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
The Jug Bay dot is along the Petuxent River. Between the corner of DC and the Bay. If you extend that top right line of DC down to the right and stop about half way before you get to the bay that should be about right for that Jug Bay dot. Thank you ever so much. As I learn more I will try to link maps to the sites if it is not giving away too much info to take away the fun.<br/>

Ya'll are doing a good job keeping this web page up. I think the mid-atlantic region is starting to take off with more people involved.<br/>
