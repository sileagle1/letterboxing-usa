PHONE: +229-8675309 (LETTERBOX REPUBLIC)<br/>
EMAIL: xxxx@y...<br/>
<br/>
I am MR JOHN PUJEH from SLOBOVIA, a Country in an undisclosed<br/>
location. My father is MR MOMOH PUJEH, former MINISTER of<br/>
LETTERBOXING and COMMUNICATIONS and one time DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER<br/>
in Slobovia. My father and mother were arrested by the government of<br/>
my Country and put in detention since 28/09/2001. My parents were<br/>
accused of keeping large quantity of LETTERBOXES in the house, and<br/>
also privately hiding large quantity of LETTERBOXES abroad. You can<br/>
verify this from SLOBOVIAN EMBASSY in your country.<br/>
<br/>
I escaped to a hide out in PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH, a State in<br/>
America with 1 Letterboxes containing about 1 stamp, a log book and<br/>
Forty Six Million virtual U.S. dollars (USv$46,000,000.00). I kept<br/>
the boxes in a SECURITY &amp; TRUST COMPANY in ********* Capital of<br/>
LEHIGH REPUBLIC. For my safety and that of the boxes, I did not let<br/>
the company know that the boxes contain a stamp and a log book. I<br/>
told them that the boxes contain FAMILY TREASURE.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot move about freely now. I need Your help urgently for both<br/>
SAFE STAMPING and LOGGING of this letterbox in your logbook. You are<br/>
one of the three email contacts given to me by a Cyber Cafe' operator<br/>
on my request for a letterboxing contact. She did not tell me your<br/>
name or country of origin. Though I did not tell her why I needed the<br/>
contact of any letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the urgent and confidential nature of this business, you<br/>
are advised to keep everything secret for now. if you are interested<br/>
in doing this business with me, kindly find this mini-letterbox and<br/>
stamp in. When stamping, include your trail name and personal stamp<br/>
for easy verification. From the Bridge of Bogert, continue 60 deg on<br/>
the trail of the South Bank until you find the last planet. At tree<br/>
at 115 deg brings you closer, find from there a crossing point at 80<br/>
deg. Across this step across and you shall be rewarded behind a<br/>
stone of light tan along the bottom of the wall of stone. Thanks for<br/>
your anticipated [cooperation].<br/>
<br/>
Yours faithfully,<br/>
MR JOHN PUJEH<br/>
