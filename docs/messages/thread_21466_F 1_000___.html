We just returned home from a rim-to-rim (automobile--inserted this <br/>
so as not to be confused with the incredible feats of the Green <br/>
Tortuga or The Northerner) trek from Seattle to San Diego (&amp; <br/>
Tijuana) and back.  Somewhere along the way we found our 1,000th <br/>
letterbox on 26 Feb 05!  The lucky 1,00th box was Night &amp; Day Mouse <br/>
in San Luis Obispo planted by the talented, gifted and gracious <br/>
JugglerMouse with whom we bumped into not only once BUT ON TWO <br/>
DIFFERENT OCCASIONS some 150 miles apart during this adventure of <br/>
ours!!!<br/>
<br/>
Along the way, we collected a lot of interesting stories, met a <br/>
handful of awesome letterboxers and dodged major weather <br/>
disturbances (torrential downpours, tornadoes, landslides, LA <br/>
traffic, you name it) and even had a brief encounter with Count Olaf <br/>
himself!!!  In a few days, we'll attempt to capture several of these <br/>
funnier 'mis-adventures' before our memories fade.<br/>
<br/>
To the myriad letterbox planters out there, thanks for the awesome <br/>
adventures through some unique territories!!!  See you along the <br/>
letterboxing trails,<br/>

boxes you found were our plants in Davis. <br/>

Can't wait to see your list of boxes and to hear your tales!<br/>
