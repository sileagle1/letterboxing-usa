I went on my first letterboxing hunt today :-) only to find that the box had<br/>
been scattered in the surrounding area. I tried emailing the address left in<br/>
the box, but the email was sent back to me. When I left there I tried to put <br/>
it<br/>
back together as best I could but it has no top. The Clue was for Pt Judith in<br/>
Narragansett, Washington County, Rhode Island. It was placed there by MadMary.<br/>
I'm not sure what to do about it though, any suggestions?<br/>

I swear to God that entire area is cursed.  Just about every <br/>
letterbox in that area gets destroyed (with the exception of Midnight <br/>
on the Moon).  I'm glad that I snagged that Pt. Judith box last <br/>
summer with Moonstone Baby.  The previous summer I got The Original <br/>
Point Judith Lighthouse (LMW &amp; YIMS), and the 3 Harbor of Refuge <br/>
(Drew Clan) before they disappeared.  I didn't even get to snag The <br/>
Replacement Point Judith Lighthouse (LMW &amp; YIMS) before it, too went <br/>
missing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, back to your original question, MadMary seems to have dropped <br/>
off the planet.  I live down the street from the Pt. Judith letterbox <br/>
during the summer.  I'm willing to a) adopt the box, b) post it to <br/>
the new site, and c) put the box back together with new materials.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting us know about this.  It is very important to <br/>
report trashed or missing letterboxes because many of us are willing <br/>
to adopt letterboxes.  You did a good thing by posting this.<br/>

Not so, but how to reach her???<br/>
I did a box check in my Hills are Alive series I saw Madmary's stamp.  She <br/>
had visited just a couple of weeks ago. <br/>

Good question.  I know her real name, her real email address, and her <br/>
real phone number, and I've been trying to reach her for months, but <br/>
to no avail ....  She no longer works where she used to work, so I <br/>
can't track her down there, either ....<br/>
<br/>
I'd still like to adopt the box, though, if it isn't being <br/>
maintained.  I noticed that the Webmasters entered it into the new <br/>
site, and MadMary hasn't been on the talk list in ages.<br/>
