Thanks for the comment. To be open about the issue, there is likely <br/>
hesitation about my offer due to the early history of letterboxing web<br/>
related activities. To be brief, I ran the original letterboxing-talk<br/>
list before this one existed. I had registered the domain name<br/>
letterboxing.com and wished to make a "club" (International Letterboxing<br/>
Club) to provide a variety of resources. There was a great deal of debate<br/>
because I refused to rule out advertising on the site/list or other forms<br/>
of revenue such as sales of supplies and advocated promotion of<br/>
letterboxing to the public (as opposed to a secretive word of mouth<br/>
approach). After much heated debate, I suggested that others who were<br/>
opposed to what I was trying to do should go ahead and form other<br/>
resources (websites and mailing lists). Truthfully by that time I had<br/>
become quite burned out on the whole mess, and did not feel like pursuing<br/>
development of my site. Subsequently, a the LBNA site and the egroups<br/>
list was created and has provided a very valuable cooperative community<br/>
for the promotion of letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
Since that time I have done very little development of my site though I<br/>
have begun some work again recently. The letterboxing-talk list has<br/>
remained open and has about 70 members at this time though with little<br/>
activity.  Many of the same people I believe are on both lists. As of<br/>
now, I do not have any plans to place advertising or sell products on the<br/>
International Letterboxing Club site and would like to primarily develop<br/>
it as a central database of clues and letterboxing sites. However, I will<br/>
not rule out further development of my site (ILC) which may include<br/>
advertising or other forms of revenue. I doubt this will happen, but to<br/>
me it is a matter of principal.<br/>
<br/>
My offer of hosting of the LBNA site is EXACTLY as I described it<br/>
previously, and completely unrelated to anything I might do with the<br/>
International Letterboxing Club site. If there are too many hard feelings<br/>
based upon things that have happened in the past for people to feel<br/>
comfortable with my offer, then I guess that is the way it has to be. I<br/>
can deal with that, I am a psychologist who deals with all forms of human<br/>
trajedy on a daily basis. I have  other things that I am working on<br/>
developing, that to me are much more important in the ultimate scheme of<br/>
things than whether my offer is accepted. Again, I wish the best for the<br/>
LBNA site regardless of where it may live in the future. <br/>

  Thankfully, you guys who have been involved from way back and who have <br/>
taken on the responsibility of managing the site will be the ones to work out <br/>
where, when and what....but it seems Eric's offer is a good one.<br/>

Eric,<br/>
<br/>
I for one am happy to see you involved with this group again. I think<br/>
your offer is extremely generous.  I remember when the original split<br/>
occured.  I wondered for awhile if the letterboxers in the US would<br/>
survive as a group.  We were so spread out and there were probably less<br/>
than 20 boxes planted in the entire country!!  We did then and later<br/>
when Dan Servatius left us and we further evolved as a web ring.  Since<br/>
then it seems like new names and faces that eclipse my meager<br/>
contributions to this pastime are popping up daily.  It is really<br/>
exciting to see the growth over the past 2-1/2 years.<br/>
<br/>
Are we going to take Eric up on his offer?  It certainly deals with all<br/>
the issues we have in regards to banner advertising.  Certainly the<br/>
price is right!  Forgive me for being blunt Eric, but if we are<br/>
seriously considering approaching a semi-related business to house the<br/>
site (such as REI), what is the difference if Eric, who once intended to<br/>
commercialize some parts of letterboxing (including the sale of a<br/>
catalog of clues), is our sponsor?<br/>
<br/>
I see only 2 stipulations that should be in place no matter where we<br/>
house the site:<br/>
<br/>
Individual authors and artist retain their copyrights to clues and<br/>
images.<br/>
<br/>
Access to make changes to the LBNA website should never be limited to<br/>
one person, yet should be a VERY closely guarded responsibility. <br/>
Possibly by persons voted on or approved by the egroups LBNA list as a<br/>
whole.<br/>
<br/>

Thom,<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks for the welcome back! I agree with you completely on both counts.<br/>
Let me make something clear, I  have _no_  interest in being involved in<br/>
any decision making about the details of LBNA development. Truthfully, I<br/>
have had my fill of the negative vibes that can come along with the need<br/>
to try to come to a concensus on things about which people have very<br/>
strong differing opions. Long after I removed myself from the process, I<br/>
think these type of conflicts apparently continued to some extent and one<br/>
consequence was that Dan is no longer involved. Although early on Dan<br/>
(and couple others) did make some rather vicious statements directed at<br/>
me, I have never held any grudges. However, it was enough to make me<br/>
aware that I did not have _any_  desire to put myself in that position<br/>
again. Whatever development I may do with the ILC site will be totally my<br/>
decision, and _completely_  seperate from anything the group may do with<br/>
the LBNA site. I simply offered the hosting because I can do it and<br/>
because I wanted to contribute.  If people want to take the offer that is<br/>
fine, if not that is fine also.  For what it is worth, I do agree with<br/>
you about the idea of that the "keepers of LBNA" should ideally be voted<br/>
on regularly if the whole point (as opposed to what I was trying to do<br/>
with my site) is for  it to truly be a community run venture.  <br/>
<br/>
No matter  what is done with the LBNA site, I am still working on making<br/>
the ILC site focused upon being a place where people can submit clues and<br/>
letterboxing sites  in as simple a way as possible (via email and/or<br/>
online form) and maintain them (edit or remove) themselves whenever<br/>
needed via a simple form. For me it is a fun techno-geek challenge to do<br/>
this.  It is not meant to compete with other clue/site repositories but<br/>
rather just another user friendly place to place clues and sites.  I<br/>
really don't have time to do much else with the ILC site right now. If<br/>
people use the ILC resource I willmaintain it, if there is no enthusiasm<br/>
for it I will probably  take it down.  Regardless, it is a completely<br/>
seperate issue from the hosting I offered for LBNA.<br/>
<br/>
I do think there is one thing people should clearly understand who may<br/>
still be suspicious of my offer. The entire control of where<br/>
www.letterboxing.org is located resides COMPLETELY with the owner of that<br/>
domain name.  ONLY that person (I think it may be Randy) can change where<br/>
that name points at any time.  As long as people maintain a backups of<br/>
the actual files that comprise LBNA (which I would suggest is done by<br/>
more than one person) it is a simple process to have the site moved to<br/>
another system by changing domain records that determine where<br/>
www.letterboxing.org lives. Point being that even if people got pissed at<br/>
me for some reason, it would take only about two days (in my experience)<br/>
to point the domain name somewhere else, and there is absolutely nothing<br/>
I could do about it.  Likewise if for some reason I became uncomforatable<br/>
with the situation (or unable to any longer provide hosting for whatever<br/>
reason), I could request that the site be moved off my servers and it<br/>
would only take a couple days for that to happen assuming other hosting<br/>
could be found. <br/>
<br/>
Now..., if some of y'all would just come to Florida for vacation and<br/>
plant some boxes I would be much happier discussing finding some boxes<br/>
down here than all this stuff. Thus far the only one I have had a chance<br/>
to find is the one in Evanston Illinois. <br/>

to access a MySQL database for a dynamic web site.  There is a LOT of potential <br/>
here if someone has the time and the skills to do it as these are fantastic <br/>
tools.<br/>

Subject: Re: [LbNA] What an offer<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I think Eric Mings' offer is a super one! <br/>
<br/>
 As a newbie, I don't much care about what went on in<br/>
the past (that's pretty much my entire life view,<br/>
too;&gt;), I just hope that there will be a centralised<br/>
location for the letterbox clues!:&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 Dr. Ming's setup on his system sounds superb, nobody<br/>
is going to find that sort of hosting for free, that's<br/>
for sure!<br/>
<br/>
 Meanwhile, I'll go back to the "olde tyme" hobby of<br/>
carving up a lot of rubber here in preparation for<br/>
some new Cali letterboxes!:&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 OOps..and P.S. - a quick way to submit clues straight<br/>
to the site sounds absolutely divine. Much easier, and<br/>
lends more freedom, I think, to the clue-writer to<br/>
spend more of his or her time placing boxes and less<br/>
worrying about how to get their clues out to the<br/>
searching (ever searching) public. So if Dr. Mings<br/>
wanted to contribue some scripting to that effect<br/>
(nudge nudge wink wink) that would be, well, spiffy:&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 In my opinion:&gt;<br/>
