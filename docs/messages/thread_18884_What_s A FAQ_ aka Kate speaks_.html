   This is Kate here ( the other half of Team Taco). The reason you <br/>
never hear from me is because Melinda's always on our computer! Just <br/>
kidding. Really, I'm not good at keeping up with these lists. I'm <br/>
too impatient to read everything. And, truthfully, she still has to <br/>
remind me how to navigate through here.Computer savvy I'm not! I <br/>
usually just wait for Melinda to tell me anything interesting. <br/>
<br/>
See (&amp; talk) to you at the gathering, <br/>
Kate, of Melinda &amp;Kate<br/>

&gt; Here, here!  I'm curious just how the IL w/o region assigned got <br/>
&gt; started anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On that note, I personally feel that southern WI should be split <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; two.  There is a world of difference between SE WI and SW WI.  <br/>
Make <br/>
&gt; the split N to S just east or west of Madison. Maybe even continue <br/>
&gt; the same split into northern IL.  There is also a world of <br/>
&gt; difference between NE and NW Il.  Thanks!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dragon<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PS. How come we never hear from Kate?<br/>

&gt; &gt; What can/should  please be fixed about "the site":<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Northern Illinois clue designation....  For some reason, DuPage <br/>
&gt; &gt; county clues pretty much always get shuffled into the "Illinois <br/>
&gt; With <br/>
&gt; &gt; No Region Assigned" category, instead of "Northern Illinois" <br/>
Clues.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Used to drive me batty to see my clues land into that weird "no <br/>
&gt; &gt; region" never-never land (who would want to look for clues <br/>
&gt; there?), <br/>
&gt; &gt; so I moved out of DuPage county because I could no longer face <br/>
&gt; life <br/>
&gt; &gt; without a region.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; But all silliness aside, I think it would help folks make up <br/>
their <br/>
&gt; &gt; mind about visiting northern IL for 'boxing if the page was an <br/>
&gt; &gt; accurate reflection of how many boxes really are in that area.<br/>
