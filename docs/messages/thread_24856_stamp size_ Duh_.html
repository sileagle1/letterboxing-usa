My signature stamp is on a white eraser--about 1' x 2'.  The stamps I've planted have mostly been around  2" x 2". On the other hand, I did plant one flea in a film canister with the stamp attached to the lid, so that was obviously much smaller.  The container for your letterbox will determine your maximum stamp size, as well as logbook size.  Many letterboxes I've found wouldn't even hold a 3"x5" spiral bound index card book.  About half that size seems to be increasingly common.  So you might not want a signature stamp to be too big.  Lots to think about--or just do it, and adjust :-)  I've encountered logbooks that I could barely fit my signature stamp into--when I used a smaller logbook, I encountered stamps that barely fit into it.  Go with the flow, compromise, be prepared!<br/>

&gt; &gt; particular stamp. The text next to it explains the size of that <br/>
&gt; stamp <br/>
&gt; &gt; and compares it to the normal size of stamps. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There are several tutorials posted at Atlas Quest, LbNA, Silent <br/>
&gt; &gt; Doug's site as well as in files and links that are listed on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; lefthand side of this (and others) chatlist. Part of Letterboxing <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; trying to figure out clues, and you will find that the more you <br/>
&gt; &gt; figure out on your own, the more you will get out of this hobby.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well, yours was 62725, so that's a heck of a lot of quick notes <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yours to read thru. :) guess that means you either don't know <br/>

Film canisters, like the tardis, are bigger on the inside than<br/>
the outside, as are some of the better mystery boxes, I might<br/>
