If you wish to be a moderator of this list, either e-mail me directly<br/>
or e-mail the moderator list.<br/>
<br/>
Pandora is apparently the only active moderator now.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

Since Randy has opened the moderator position up to the boards I <br/>
thought I would take a moment to give a few thoughts to the group <br/>
for those that might wish to become moderators.<br/>
<br/>
Being a moderator on the LBNA list is not always easy.  The LBNA <br/>
list has a habit of getting heated and nasty at times and as a <br/>
moderator your find yourself extinguishing fires quite often.  If <br/>
you are not the kind of person that handles that sort of thing well <br/>
it is probably not something you would enjoy doing.  If you're the <br/>
sort of person who is often being extinguished, then a moderator <br/>
position is probably not for you either. <laugh> -- moderating the <br/>
LBNA list also takes some time and dedication, you need to be able <br/>
to promptly reply to people's inquiries, approve posts, change <br/>
moderation status and handle complaints.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the things I have also found in being a moderator is that <br/>
many times you need to be silent on a thread that you might feel <br/>
passionate about, in order to make a non-biased decision on <br/>
something if the thread gets out of hand.  Being a moderator is <br/>
definitely not a fun thing all the time, and definitely not a <br/>
position to take if you are just looking to control what other <br/>
people are saying on the list, because you don't get to control <br/>
anything, you simply get to put out the fires after they start them.<br/>
<br/>
I think the other thing to remember is that moderators have to work <br/>
together, nobody can be expected to do all the work all the time, <br/>
and sometimes, as moderators we don't always agree with what one <br/>
moderator does, yet support it fully to maintain a united front as <br/>
moderators.  With any sort of position where more than one person is <br/>
actively doing something, communication is essential. All the <br/>
moderators need to know what the others are doing.<br/>
<br/>
So all that said I look forward to seeing who jumps up to help <br/>
moderate the LBNA list and look forward to working with them. <br/>
Hopefully this post will help some decide if it is something they <br/>
wish to do or not, and help Randy not have to weed through 100s of <br/>
applications either.<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well,<br/>
