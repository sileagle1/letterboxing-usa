from a nice gentleman from the naval air base in Oak Harbor who has the <br/>
'remains' of the box. The box was found on the beach near the naval base <br/>
containing nothing but weeds. (The log book and stamp etc are all missing.)<br/>
<br/>
I know this happens to boxes, but this is my first. I never even got to <br/>
check the log book. I hope Elvis made an appearance. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anywhoo, the Langley box is out of commission at this time... I'll likely <br/>
replace it sometime soon (in a different hiding spot)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who did get a chance to visit it. I hope you enjoyed the <br/>
hunt.<br/>
