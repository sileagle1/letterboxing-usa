<br/>
We're off to RI again for our vacation and I'd like to check on the <br/>
status of some boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Dolphins at Daybreak - I was warned last year that this box was <br/>
missing.  I'm assuming it has been replaced?<br/>
<br/>
Salty Brine - Tried to find last year and I swear it wasn't there.  <br/>
Has anybody seen it recently?<br/>
<br/>
Midnight on the Moon - Also tried last year but couldn't find, I <br/>
don't think we were even close.<br/>
<br/>
The Block Island boxes - Call me crazy, I'm braving the ferry with a <br/>
kid who tends to puke.  I think it will be an adventure!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help!<br/>

boxes but Dolphins at Daybreak has been replaced (with Epilogue <br/>
added). Midnight on the Moon should be in its spot (though the stamp <br/>
is broken, it is still usable). I need to get there and repair it <br/>
before the path along the coast is overgrown with poison ivy.<br/>

<br/>
Dolphins at Daybreak - was there in March with second box added (I <br/>
love the story line of these boxes.)<br/>
<br/>
Salty Brine - was removed permenantly due to vandalism.<br/>
<br/>
Midnight on the Moon - was there at the end of April.<br/>
<br/>
The Block Island boxes - I have not done these yet so can't report on <br/>
their status.<br/>
<br/>
have fun!<br/>
