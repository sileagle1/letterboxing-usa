It sounds like 'wouldn't be nice if we had a fee to enter the state parks?'<br/>
and it has grown in discussion since, but still no plan or means to implement<br/>
one has been detailed.<br/>
<br/>
It may come for sure, but I don't look for it to be in force by 1/1/2003<br/>
or even the first quarter. Who knows, it may be folly for the summer camping<br/>
season.<br/>
