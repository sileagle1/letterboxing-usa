Yesterday, March 23, I checked in on Viking Ships at Sunrise and <br/>
Ghost Town at Sundown in South Kingstown, RI.  Both were present and <br/>
accounted for.<br/>
<br/>
However, I regret to announce that the Crossways Crossed Paths box, <br/>
which CZF (aka Warrior Woman) and I placed back in August is <br/>
missing.  I didn't see any pieces strewn around, so I can only assume <br/>
it was found by groundskeepers and removed.  I have no plans to <br/>
replace this box at this time.<br/>
