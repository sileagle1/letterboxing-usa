<br/>
About 5 level miles round trip from the Jefferson Memorial. About 100<br/>
yards of walking if you drive: very kid-and-elderly-oriented.<br/>
<br/>
Walk, run, ride, roll, or drive past the Jefferson Memorial to the<br/>
southern tip of Hains Point, following the signs for East Potomac Park.<br/>
This is a wonderful open area with vast views of the river and is<br/>
marvelously refreshing to jangled nerves from the hustle bustle of<br/>
Washington.<br/>
<br/>
Just north of a most surprising statue is a playground. The Cherry<br/>
Blossom Letterbox lives in the golf course fence line north of the<br/>
mound and the restroom. At the fence on a service road, exactly lined<br/>
up with the eastern face of the restroom, take 18 steps easterly,<br/>
probably 1/4 of the way along the mound. The northeast corner of the<br/>
bathroom is at 194 degrees. Facing the fence, the box is just to the<br/>
west of a smooth bark beech tree on the other side. Good luck!<br/>

Roosevelt Island<br/>
<br/>
A single letterbox on an easy flat one mile hike with fantastic views.<br/>
<br/>
At the Roosevelt Island National Park in the Potomac River near<br/>
Arlington National Cemetary, cross the footbridge and pick up a map at<br/>
the info board. Go right, south, with the trail and visit the memorial<br/>
to this great conservationist. Head south on the Woods Trail to the<br/>
southern tip of the island under the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge. Turning<br/>
north, you have three equally-appealing trails to choose from to reach<br/>
the northern shore of the island. Turning west down near that northern<br/>
shore, after the Upland Trail and the drinking fountain, follow a<br/>
narrower footpath along the water. You'll find a large group of rocks<br/>
jutting out northwards into the water. From these<br/>
rocks, the old Jones family boathouse is framed to the left in the<br/>
second arch of the Key Bridge at 327 degrees (you did bring your<br/>
compass to DC with you?). The more modern boathouse with ramps to the<br/>
water is to the right at 092 degrees. Just on shore before these<br/>
particular rocks is a faded path to the left (left when facing<br/>
northwards towards the rocks and the water, a path<br/>
tending northwest). The Teddy Roosevelt Letterbox is hidden in the ivy<br/>
on the right a few steps up the path.<br/>
