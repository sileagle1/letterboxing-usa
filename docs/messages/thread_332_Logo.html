"Stamp-like" letters would also be a nice touch.  And Bonita's<br/>
suggestion to use something very simple, like a line drawing <br/>
superimosed with the words "Letterboxing USA" in a smaller,<br/>
simpler font I think is a good idea too.  I'm happy there are<br/>
people who care enough about this to give their input.  Personally,<br/>
I don't think about it that much, but that does not mean its<br/>
not important.  I think you are all important, so if you're thinking<br/>
about this its important to think about.<br/>

Der Mad Stamper has been up to some digital doodling again...<br/>
<br/>
The main page of Letterbox USA was probably not the best place to post my<br/>
latest creation, since it is very much incomplete.  I won't leave it there for<br/>
long, but it helps to see how things look together.<br/>
<br/>
This is my attempt at Linda Aplin's idea for a new logo.  Hopefully, I can<br/>
make the final version a bit smaller and still keep everthing identifiable.<br/>
Also, I can play around with colors... these were just the first ones that I<br/>
came up with.  And, of course, this version is very much incomplete.  Before I<br/>
put much more time into it, however, I wanted to see what some of our group<br/>
members thought of it.  Comments??<br/>
<br/>
If we were to go ahead with this idea, I have other pictures in mind for the<br/>
remaining letters, such as Mt. Rushmore, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Statue of<br/>
Liberty... maybe Seattle's Space Needle, the St. Louis Arch... we could<br/>
discuss other possibilities.  They could be things other than landmarks, as<br/>
well... someone riding a horse, a combine harvesting wheat, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know what you think.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Mitch<br/>

I think that's very much what Linda had in mind.  At least, it's what I thought she had in mind.  I LOVE IT!  IMHO, I think we're on the right track.  I'm not sure we need the "Greetings from" but the overall look is great.  Personally, I'd prefer a more "natural" shade of green (darker, more like a forest)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, we could use one of the pictures of letterboxers doing what they love to do (Kids page, or TX page) in the "L".  And maybe a picture of a book w/ a variety of stamps collected in it in another letter(I think I saw some on one of the Dartomoor links or we could make our own, if anyone has a couple of pages full of stamps yet).<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I would prefer more outdoors/nature oriented landmarks.  For example, Gd Canyon, Mt Rushmore, Crater Lake.  I also agree, Mitch, that all the pictures don't necessarily need to be recognizable landmarks.  There are many "generic" sites that can be viewed as fairly typical of North America (Wheatfield w/ combine, Ranch, Canyonlands, Pacific Cost Highway, Rocky Mts, Appalachians, family hiking somewhere, canoe on lake, grasslands, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
OK, that's too much from me already.  Thanks for the time you've already put into this.  I truly like it a lot.  Looking forward to seeing other opinions.<br/>

<br/>
My original intention was to eventually make a much smaller version that would<br/>
appear on other pages of the website.  The version that's on the main page<br/>
would be a little bit smaller than it is now, but not much or the pictures are<br/>
hard to identify.  The "Greetings from" part is optional, but I sort of<br/>
thought it preserved the classic postcard style that inspired the logo.<br/>
Regardless of whether we leave it or axe it on the main page, I would<br/>
eliminate it from the tiny version that appeared on other pages.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Maybe, we could use one of the pictures of letterboxers doing what they love<br/>
&gt; to do (Kids page, or TX page) in the "L".  And maybe a picture of a book w/<br/>
a <br/>
&gt; variety of stamps collected in it in another letter<br/>
<br/>
The reason I went with easily identifiable landmarks, is that the pictures are<br/>
quite small, and will probably get smaller.  If the pictures are not<br/>
recognizable icons with good contrast they become "mystery" pictures.  <br/>
<br/>
I had played around with some pictures I had of the St. Louis skyline (with<br/>
arch) and the Seattle Space Needle only to find that they were completely<br/>
unidentifiable once I had shrunk them to size and squeezed them into the shape<br/>
of a letter.  I'm sure I can find better pictures to use of these landmarks<br/>
(if we want to include them), but things like a book of stamps or a group of<br/>
people will probably be hard to recognize once they are zapped down to such a<br/>
small size.<br/>
<br/>
Things like a combine in a wheatfield, or a shot of the Rocky Mtns (as you<br/>
suggested) might work nicely.  A grassland meadow, however, would probably<br/>
come off looking like I filled the letter in with the color green.  I do<br/>
appreciate your suggestion of trying to keep the landmarks more "outdoorsy".<br/>
<br/>
More comments, please...<br/>

I agree that the shade of green I was using was rather "unnatural".  I tried<br/>
your suggestion of using forest green, but it seemed to get lost in the dark<br/>
colors of some of the photos.  If we go with lots of natural scenes, there<br/>
will likely be lots of forest green in these pictures.  For now, I switched it<br/>
to yellow.  This seems to stand out well and hopefully is more pleasing to the<br/>
eye than my earlier "X-files" green.<br/>

WOW! You move fast.  Yellow is much better.  Have you tried plain old boring white?  I do like the Yellow though.  It's just hard to imagine what looks best.  Actually, it's probably depend on the colors in the images the group chooses to use; that is if the group goes with this concept, which I hope we do.<br/>

I can give this a try.  As you say, what looks best in the end will be<br/>
dependent on the images we choose, as well as the background colors of the<br/>
various pages we want to place the logo on.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I'm just doodling here.  I would love to see any other ideas<br/>
that anyone may have.  I think Thom and Michelle (and maybe others) have shown<br/>
interest in doing artwork for the site.<br/>
<br/>
I'm curious about where Dan came up with Kids Corner logo.  If this is not an<br/>
entirely original bit of artwork, maybe we should also consider coming up with<br/>
a new logo for this area.  Someone might even have a better idea for naming<br/>
the kids' section.<br/>

I was in Finnegan's this morning (a local toy store) &amp; they had a nice<br/>
selection of reprinted vintage postcards with this very theme.  I<br/>
thought the most striking was a sky blue background (something we aren't<br/>
seeing much up here in the NW right now)... maybe even a few clouds. <br/>
The outlines of the letters were red.. the drop shadows a darker blue.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of putting some americana scenes in the letters... that,<br/>
after all is the intent of this style.  Mitch's warning of losing detail<br/>
as we shrink &amp; fit scenes to letters will limit what we can use.  Since<br/>
we don't have 50 letters to fill, and we want to be fair... why not use<br/>
fairly generic photo material to "fill" the letters?  I think a forest,<br/>
lake, desert, city, barn, wheat field, beach, etc, etc... would show the<br/>
great diversity of our country (or countries, if we want to include our<br/>
buddies to the north, south &amp; wherever else we end up supporting)<br/>
without getting too specific.<br/>

One teeny additional suggestion...  don't make the graphic too huge... I<br/>
get extremely impatient waiting for long winded graphical pages to load.<br/>

&gt;ideas that anyone may have.  I think <br/>
&gt;Thom and Michelle (and maybe others) have<br/>

<br/>
Well, I'd love to contribute some opinions/ideas for a<br/>
logo. I think Mitch's work is outstanding. If he <br/>
welcomes the idea of contributions and opinions,<br/>
I'll begin by giving my opinions on the subject. <br/>
<br/>
First of all, are we trying to create an actual<br/>
logo for LetterboxingUSA? When I think of logo,<br/>
I think of a stylized symbol. Something that can<br/>
be used for a wide variety of applications. <br/>
There's a big difference between a web page<br/>
cover masthead and an actual logo, IMO. I think<br/>
Mitch's current artwork is fabulous. It will work<br/>
great for the website masthead, and will also <br/>
be ideal for other applications. <br/>
<br/>
However, if it's an actual logo that we're <br/>
hoping to develop, I think we should keep in mind <br/>
a couple of important things. When designing a logo,<br/>
it's current *and* possible future applications should <br/>
be considered. <br/>
<br/>
Actual logos should really be kept simple and <br/>
identifiable. They should be able to shrink<br/>
down to as small as under an inch across<br/>
and remain readable/recognizable and still<br/>
look tidy. They should work as well in full<br/>
color as in black and white "line art" in a wide<br/>
variety of applications. For instance, will we <br/>
ever be putting the logo on awards, stamps,<br/>
printed media, etc.? I believe it's important<br/>
to keep this in mind. I realize LetterboxingUSA<br/>
isn't a corporation that will be churning out<br/>
advertising and merchandise, but it may be<br/>
important to have a tidy logo suitable for<br/>
future applications other than websites.<br/>
<br/>
Mitch is already discovering the limitations<br/>
of incorporating more than simple or stylized<br/>
ideas into a logo. Looks great full size and in<br/>
color on a web page, but doesn't shrink well. <br/>
<br/>
Logos don't have to be representational. They<br/>
can be abstract, and still be recognizable<br/>
through use. The idea of keeping the logo <br/>
abstract -giving it an intriguing or mysterious<br/>
quality- appeals to me. Also, a typographical<br/>
or stylized solution is appealing. I'd be happy<br/>
to sketch some ideas for consideration as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I love Mitch's artwork. Perfect<br/>
for the web page. I just don't think it's ideally <br/>
suited for "logo" use if that is our aim. Of<br/>
course this may be a semantic issue. <br/>
<br/>
I love hearing other people's opinions on the<br/>
subject and feedback on my opinions.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Michelle makes a good point.  I think what I'm working on might make a good<br/>
masthead for the main page.  Something to "greet" you when you pull up our<br/>
site.  For most of the other web pages, as well as for any brochures, patches,<br/>
or other fun stuff we might put out in the future, we need a simple logo.  <br/>
<br/>
The vivid red, white, and blue design I slapped together earlier is a better<br/>
example of a true "logo" than this retro postcard thing I'm doing now.<br/>
Unfortunately, I will be the first to admit that very little thought or effort<br/>
went into it, and it comes across sorta sappy, and "Cheeze Whiz" (as my friend<br/>
and neighbor Thom puts it).<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to take all your suggestions into account regarding the types of<br/>
pictures to include and carry on with my "masthead" design.  Meanwhile, I<br/>
would love to see Michelle's ideas for a real logo!!!!<br/>

&gt;  Well, I'd love to contribute some opinions/ideas for a<br/>
&gt;  logo. I think Mitch's work is outstanding. If he <br/>
&gt;  welcomes the idea of contributions and opinions,<br/>
&gt;  I'll begin by giving my opinions on the subject. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  First of all, are we trying to create an actual<br/>
&gt;  logo for LetterboxingUSA? When I think of logo,<br/>
&gt;  I think of a stylized symbol. Something that can<br/>
&gt;  be used for a wide variety of applications. <br/>
&gt;  There's a big difference between a web page<br/>
&gt;  cover masthead and an actual logo, IMO. I think<br/>
&gt;  Mitch's current artwork is fabulous. It will work<br/>
&gt;  great for the website masthead, and will also <br/>
&gt;  be ideal for other applications. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  However, if it's an actual logo that we're <br/>
&gt;  hoping to develop, I think we should keep in mind <br/>
&gt;  a couple of important things. When designing a logo,<br/>
&gt;  it's current *and* possible future applications should <br/>
&gt;  be considered. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Actual logos should really be kept simple and <br/>
&gt;  identifiable. They should be able to shrink<br/>
&gt;  down to as small as under an inch across<br/>
&gt;  and remain readable/recognizable and still<br/>
&gt;  look tidy. They should work as well in full<br/>
&gt;  color as in black and white "line art" in a wide<br/>
&gt;  variety of applications. For instance, will we <br/>
&gt;  ever be putting the logo on awards, stamps,<br/>
&gt;  printed media, etc.? I believe it's important<br/>
&gt;  to keep this in mind. I realize LetterboxingUSA<br/>
&gt;  isn't a corporation that will be churning out<br/>
&gt;  advertising and merchandise, but it may be<br/>
&gt;  important to have a tidy logo suitable for<br/>
&gt;  future applications other than websites.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Mitch is already discovering the limitations<br/>
&gt;  of incorporating more than simple or stylized<br/>
&gt;  ideas into a logo. Looks great full size and in<br/>
&gt;  color on a web page, but doesn't shrink well. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Logos don't have to be representational. They<br/>
&gt;  can be abstract, and still be recognizable<br/>
&gt;  through use. The idea of keeping the logo <br/>
&gt;  abstract -giving it an intriguing or mysterious<br/>
&gt;  quality- appeals to me. Also, a typographical<br/>
&gt;  or stylized solution is appealing. I'd be happy<br/>
&gt;  to sketch some ideas for consideration as<br/>
&gt;  well.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Anyhow, I love Mitch's artwork. Perfect<br/>
&gt;  for the web page. I just don't think it's ideally <br/>
&gt;  suited for "logo" use if that is our aim. Of<br/>
&gt;  course this may be a semantic issue. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I love hearing other people's opinions on the<br/>
&gt;  subject and feedback on my opinions.<br/>

I like where this postcard theme is going - while it might be fun to<br/>
include letterbox images within the letters, I see the problem with the<br/>
image scale. I'd suggest using whatever seems to work, as I assume<br/>
substitutions can be made if and when something 'letterboxish' turns up<br/>
with a good graphic image. <br/>
<br/>
So, letterboxers all - submit your images to Der Mad Stamper!<br/>

Good work, Mitch<br/>

<br/>I have an idea:  How about the 4 letters: LUSA in stamp-
<br/>like form.  This could easily shrink down.  It could be color
<br/>or it could be black and white and not lose anything...
<br/>Just a thought.

&gt;Re: Logos..and the ideas from Michele...etc....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hey great stuff that, I love what you have said....a nice compact<br/>
&gt;re-usable logo would be nice...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Certainly the mastheads for Kids etc are right for where they are, but a<br/>
&gt;single scalable discrete ID entity would be nice imho....(loved the<br/>
&gt;shadowy tree image on Michele's site for example of a cool ID) <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The logo is certainly a great need....Dartmoor has a simple logo.... the<br/>
&gt;100 club patch....but the patches are fun things to use to create the<br/>
&gt;whole feeling of the L-USA identity.....and about being part of it....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Some time ago I mentioned to "Uncle" Stamper some stuff about an idea for<br/>
&gt;a L-USA patch..but it contains something that might be considered when<br/>
&gt;forming the logo...ie not "Just" the The USA dimension....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A key element of L-USA for me    is that  " Letterboxing has taken to the<br/>
&gt;sky "  ( a metaphor for the INTERNET and the satellites that drive it<br/>
&gt;all)...Without Dan and the technodriven style of L-USA this whole idea<br/>
&gt;could never have occurred (taken flight) so I do think it needs to be<br/>
&gt;(honoured ?) echoed in the logo somehow...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I see an image for the patch as a satellite looking like a US tin box<br/>
&gt;letterbox (red falg hi) sailing in the purple royal dark skies of space<br/>
&gt;above "the good earth" and in the parted clouds the whole US is bathed in<br/>
&gt;golden sunlight, green and fertile with sparkling seas on either side<br/>
&gt;...and climbing and descending from that landscape small rubber<br/>
&gt;stamps...arriving and departing our orbiting letterbox.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I envision this like the one of the NASA mission patches .... about 2.5<br/>
&gt;...3 inches across...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;around the perimeter or maybe along the track of our orbiting letterbox it<br/>
&gt;says ...Letterboxing USA ....50 in Y2K....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;or similar.....oh and I see the patch being an annual  idea ...  limited<br/>
&gt;editions....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;maybe even a contest ! ( maybe a kids one too )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just thinking out loud......hope that's fun !<br/>

I am from the other end of the spectrum.... flag waving Patriot and<br/>

group is not for making statements politically or idealogically.  This<br/>
group is for letterboxing first and nothing second.  The name and logo<br/>
represent what and where we are in the world.  I don't have any aversion<br/>
to the r/w/b color scheme, although I think at this point it is<br/>
premature to think about color.  As Michelle stated, the design should<br/>
work big, small, color or b/w.  Logo colors will be the next can of<br/>
worms...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, what a great thing that everyone is so interested in this<br/>
logo.  Thank you very much Michelle for taking time with it.<br/>
This has really livened things up.<br/>
<br/>
I just have a few comments about the logo.<br/>
<br/>
About logos in general<br/>
(as though you haven't heard enough already!):<br/>
<br/>
A logo, if it is done well, will encapsulate the essence of a <br/>
theme or idea that may have (esp. in this case) a multitude of<br/>
aspects or themes.  Not one of them has to stand out over the<br/>
others.  Something that says it all somehow without downplay-<br/>
ing anything else is ideal.<br/>
<br/>
About our logo:<br/>
<br/>
I said before that I am not a Patriot (not with a big "P").  But, I<br/>
do like the traditional colors of red, white and blue and the inherent<br/>
symbology there.  In the original title I had the word "Letterboxing"<br/>
in gold and "USA" in red, white and blue.  I felt the traditional<br/>
colors may help to stress our unity and help to remind us of the<br/>
artistic elements in the flag which represent the unity of the 50 <br/>
states. It is (without considering anything else) a beautiful work<br/>
of art.  Borrowing the colors for our logo would be just a hint or<br/>
reminder of the symbology and the artistic elements of (I believe)<br/>
Betsy Ross's work.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the maps do cover<br/>
the U.S. geographically and they are supported by free mapping<br/>
information provided by the Census Bureau.  This consistent element<br/>
will no doubt help to form the gist of the mapping.  It ultimately<br/>
will allow us to have a very user friendly system that is not hard to<br/>
keep up and which will allow us much freedom to just have fun with<br/>
letterboxing instead of having to concentrate efforts on publishing and<br/>
map-making.  I feel very thankful that things like this mapping system<br/>
are available to us and are free of charge.  Our government is to be<br/>
credited with this particularly useful time and energy saver.  It was<br/>
designed specifically to allow the kind of thing we are doing.  It is<br/>
much more powerful than this actually, but it saves us a lot of time<br/>
even for the limited purpose to which we are applying it. <br/>
<br/>
I also feel that the U.S. is inclusive/open (well, hopefully not<br/>
open to mean people, but you know what I mean).  Like I said I don't<br/>
belong to a political party nor do I wave a flag ever (though I<br/>
sometimes feel guilty that I do not).  But I do feel that we can<br/>
accomodate any place anywhere with maps whether they are outside <br/>
U.S. borders or not without having to change the meaning of our<br/>
title or the symbolgy of the USA part.<br/>
<br/>
This is what I mean by inclusive:  We won't stop at U.S. borders<br/>
if other people want to be included in the maps.  We do not have to<br/>
change the theme of the name or the logo to do that.  It says something<br/>
about who we are and what we are about independently.<br/>
<br/>
It makes some sense to me<br/>
for an inclusive and open group to have a connection (rootedness)<br/>
with a symbology that represents unity.  Whether our heritage has<br/>
always been in keeping with that unity is dubious, but the meaning<br/>
and intent is there.  And that, after all, is all that is being<br/>
sought in a logo.<br/>
<br/>
I have not been averse to other themes or colors for the logo.  But<br/>
I just thought it may help if I explained why I chose the original<br/>
name and colors and what they mean to me.  Therefore #21 to me is<br/>
the most fitting of the samples Michelle has submitted.  I could even<br/>
see the "L" as gold to help set it off from the USA part.  I like both<br/>
of the "A" symbols that she used, but the arrowhead one seems to say<br/>
something of the original inhabitants of this land (perhaps<br/>
unintentionally).  I feel it would be a nice gesture to pay homage<br/>
to them symbolically.  This is not a feeling of preference for native <br/>
Americans that I am talking about.  It is merely acknowledgement of a<br/>
very salient aspect of our history.  They were living here when the <br/>
Europeans first arrived and even before the Vikings arrived.  They <br/>
were here first.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
Dan'l <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ps.  Please don't use anything I've said here to set off any sort of<br/>
debate about idealogical or political issues.  If you read it carefully<br/>
you will see that that's not what it is.  Please do not reduce this<br/>
discussion from one about the symbology of a logo to one about political<br/>
views.  I am not in it for that.  I'm a letterboxer first and a patriot<br/>
(with a small "p") second.<br/>
