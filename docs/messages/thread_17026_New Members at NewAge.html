been a surge of new member requests. I'd like to thank all the people <br/>
complaining about our database. It seems to have perked an interest <br/>
in our group. However, I'm no longer approving new memberships. I <br/>
think it best to not add any new members at this time. It seems that <br/>
some people are to afraid to join with their real yahoo ID, and have <br/>
made up new ones, or are using old ones that they haven't used for <br/>
years. I find it funny that people have to spy so they can watch us. <br/>
Just for the record, I've never denied anyone membership, even if <br/>
they weren't for the database.<br/>
I also find it funny that such a small group has caused so much drama <br/>
to take place. I haven't responded to the posts on this list because <br/>
frankly, I can't think of anything at all to say. I read all these <br/>
posts about how "disrespectful" I've been and all I can do is shake <br/>
my head in disbelief. <br/>
Anyway, I just wanted all the spies to know that they shouldn't <br/>
bother to try to join the NewAge group. Membership is not open at <br/>
this time. <br/>
<br/>
With all due respect,<br/>

*Note that I said "due respect". I refuse to respect people that are <br/>
childish enough to pull their boxes because someone doesn't play <br/>
their way. "If you don't play my way, I'm takin' my ball and goin' <br/>
home!"<br/>
