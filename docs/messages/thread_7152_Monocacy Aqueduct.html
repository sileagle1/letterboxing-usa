I planted this box in the spring before the under brush was up and this <br/>
summer two people have looked for, and not found, this box. I believe that <br/>
the vegetation is keeping a tight lid on it's location. Perhaps seeking it <br/>
out in the fall would be an idea. The aqueduct is way cool and the box is <br/>
not far south down the tow path but it's up to you. Great stamp...wish <br/>
someone would find it....<br/>
Will check on it next time I am down in Maryland!<br/>

We enjoy the challenging boxes!<br/>
<br/>
On a general note, I wanted to thank all of the Yahoo subscribers for <br/>
being so gracious.  So far, letterboxing has been a marvelously <br/>
exciting experience.  Everyone we have encountered has been calm and <br/>
helpful even when we were less than patient.  I didn't even freak out <br/>
when my car broke down the first day we were boxing in <br/>
Burkittsville.  Usually, that would be enough to put me right over <br/>
the edge.  <br/>
