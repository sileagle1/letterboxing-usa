Bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition. They traveled from <br/>
St. Louis, MO to Astoria, OR and back again.  I have placed several <br/>
Mystery Letterboxes along the Lewis and Clark Trail and I hope to <br/>
plant many more before 2004. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To find this box here are your clues:<br/>
<br/>
Lewis and Clark camped here in 1805 and again in 1806.  The letterbox <br/>
is in a park at the lowest elevation in what is now this state!<br/>
You can park at the playground. Walk toward the river. At picnic <br/>
shelter #2 go right along the path. In the grassy area, there are two <br/>
tall trees and a stump (you might not see the stump at first because <br/>
it is covered with vegetation). See the rock at the base of the <br/>
stump?  The letterbox is behind it! Please when you rehide it, make <br/>
sure it cannot be seen by just looking into the stump.  Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Amanda from Seattle<br/>

Please read the waiver of responsibility and liability!  And always <br/>
be DISCREET when hunting or hiding letterboxes!!  <br/>
