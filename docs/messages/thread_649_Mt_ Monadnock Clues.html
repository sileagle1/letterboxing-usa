That makes makes 18 boxes in the last month or so. This is probably <br/>
the last time I will have caught up with him. He's told me he has <br/>
another dozen boxes in the works. Jay is starting to see the <br/>
desirability of learning to put up his own clue pages!<br/>
<br/>
I had a nice letterboxing hunt yesterday, finding Erik and Susan's <br/>
two new boxes in Shirley Center MA and Bonnie's new box in Shieling <br/>
Forest NH. Lovely fall day, lovely sites, lovely stamps.<br/>

After I posted the changes, I saw the same thing. Jay's own links for <br/>
those two sites (on his Letterboxing Northeast page) appear to be <br/>
faulty. I let him know about this problem, but haven't heard back <br/>
yet. I will change the links from our maps as soon as I see the <br/>
correct addresses.<br/>

<br/>
I will redirect our map links for Mt. Snow and Mt. Monadnock to the <br/>
original clue pages I made up for you. You might want to do the same <br/>
on your Letterboxing Northeast index page until you have recreated <br/>
new clue pages yourself.<br/>

site at .../catsdice/lbna/clues, do you ever get aol-lockout? I was<br/>
happily updating the Monadnock page with a couple of more cluesheets<br/>
when things went sour. At first I thought the page just wouldn't<br/>
overwrite, so I deleted it and tried to re-write again. Now it's gone<br/>
forever....it's probably just operator error. I have noticed that lbna<br/>
isn't the most stable page in the world and have assumed it was an aol<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
I'll post Monadnock and Snow here for you Randy, since they're short,<br/>
until I figure this web publishing thing out a little better.<br/>
