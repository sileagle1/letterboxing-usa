                    <html><body>Since I live in target rich CT, I thought that I would check the website for boxes in different states.  I was shocked to see that there were many states that had only a few letterboxes!  For example, Montana has eight, Utah has seven, South Dakota has three, Wyoming has only two, and North Dakota only has one!
<br/>
<br/>So I'm just wondering.... who planted these lone boxes and are there boxers who live in these states? Or, are they planted by boxers from other states for other letterboxers, who are also on vacation, to come and find?
<br/>
<br/>Does that make any sense?  Just curious.....

I was shocked to see that there were many states <br/>
&gt; that had only a few letterboxes!  For example, Montana has eight, Utah has <br/>
&gt; seven, South Dakota has three, Wyoming has only two, and North Dakota only <br/>
&gt; has one!<br/>
<br/>
Alabama only has one box as well. Although I live in Georgia, I intend <br/>
to help them out with a couple in late Spring.<br/>

&gt; Wyoming has only two, [...] So I'm just wondering.... who planted these <br/>
&gt; lone boxes <br/>
<br/>
I placed one in Wyoming on 8/19/00 (mapsurfer #26)<br/>
Mitch (der Mad Stamper) placed one in WY on 9/30/00<br/>
Mohmers placed one in WY 5/1/02<br/>
Ryan placed one in WY or MT or ID on 9/22/02<br/>
Aryn placed two in WY on 12/28/02 and 12/30/02<br/>
There are 2 others in WY on a personal web site<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure there's more, and results for other states may or may not be similar.<br/>
Still not that many, tho.  I don't know the status of them or if they have<br/>
gone missing.<br/>
<br/>
I like placing them when I travel and have placed in 19 states or so.  I hope<br/>
to <br/>
place one in ID this summer (the clues have been written for a while ...).  Its<br/>
fun to write the clues remotely, and go to the place and see if they work --<br/>
that way you get the fun of hunting your own boxes :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

Looks like the Wyoming webmaster has been falling down on the job.  <br/>
Rustypuff and I placed one in Wyoming back on 9/7/2002.  The clue is <br/>
here: <http: cscm="" letterboxes="" thatched.html="" where="" www.quahog.org="">.  <br/>
We haven't heard a thing about it since placing it.<br/>

I have two in Wyoming that don't show up on that page.  (One is a <br/>
mystery box, and it is on the mystery box page, but the other I did <br/>
NOT want on the LbNA website!)  I hid two others in Utah that aren't <br/>
on the page.<br/>
<br/>
Amanda from Seattle has hid a few boxes in those states as well that <br/>
are mystery boxes and don't show up on the webpage for that state <br/>
either.  Of hers, I remember at least two in Wyoming and two in <br/>
Utah.  I may have forgotten a couple, though!<br/>
