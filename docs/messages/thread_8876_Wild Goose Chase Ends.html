                    <html><body><p>Yesterday, while attempting to find some landmarks here in CT for the start of some letterboxing adventures with my 12 year old nephew and his uncle who were visiting from NY, I put my nephew in charge of reading the road map. I told him about where I thought we might want to end up and....well....he got sort of confused with that north/south, east/west, left/right stuff. Consequently, we went around in circles...sort of on a W<em>ild Goose Chase</em>...if you know what I mean. </p>
<p>Finally, after a half hour or so, I could tell he was getting confused and it was time to <em>hang it up. S</em>o, we all just stopped at the first trail head that I'm sure we had <em>flown by</em> at least twice already. As luck would have it, it was exactly the one we were looking for. </p>
<p>Happily, clues in hand, we made our way on a short and very pretty hike through the woods. I discovered that my nephew is much better at reading clues than reading road maps. He <em>flew</em> through those woods, using his compass and counting steps out loud right to the box we were seeking. Since this was his first ever letterbox, we took some time so he could look through the log book at all the interesting stamps while we relaxed and enjoyed watching him discover letterboxing and answering his endless questions, glad that, for the moment, our own <em>Wild Goose Chase</em> had ended in that lovely spot. </p>
