Well, check your calendar, 'cause it's official! We're having a <br/>
gathering here in Western NY on November 13th from 11- to 6pm in <br/>
Medina, NY. We'd like to get extra boxes to add to our current <br/>
plants, so if you'd like to send a box based on the theme "Something <br/>
I'm Thankful For" to add and hide out here, let me know so we can get <br/>
a good spot for it (even if you can't make it personally, which we <br/>
hope you CAN!!!).<br/>
<br/>
You can start RSVPing to us (the Sprite &amp; the Highlander) as soon as <br/>
you'd like (just send direct to our e-mail or as a private message. <br/>
I'll post a little website regarding location and hotels this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all there (although not QUITE as many of you as in <br/>
Mansfield, since that would pretty much overload this town!) ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The (already overexcited) Sprite and the (chuckling at his wife's <br/>
insanity) Highlander<br/>
<br/>
P.S.--This will be reposted on the NY site and the Canadian site, but <br/>
I don't want to over post...would someone else mention it to those in <br/>
the LBGLK and LBMA?<br/>
