&gt; I'm still making plans for a gathering on Sunday, August 24th in Ithaca, <br/>
&gt; NY. Anyone willing to travel to the Central NY/Finger Lakes area is welcome <br/>
&gt; to join us. Alafair has graciously offered to hold stamp carving and book <br/>
&gt; binding classes, and we'll do a potluck meal as well as whatever other <br/>
&gt; activities people decide would be fun. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Stewart Park on the shore of Cayuga Lake is the best location for this <br/>
&gt; gathering, with ample (free, as opposed to $7 for the state parks) parking <br/>
&gt; and lots of room for exploring. I've been in touch with the park office and <br/>
&gt; there's rental space available in one of the picnic pavilions as of today. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd like to reserve this space in the next few days because it's sure to be <br/>
&gt; snapped up soon. This particular pavilion is adjacent to a playground and <br/>
&gt; not far from the lake shore. The rental charge is based on the group size, <br/>
&gt; though, so I need a general idea of how many people might attend. The <br/>
&gt; maximum rental group they still have space for right now is 40. If our <br/>
&gt; group ends up bigger than that (fingers crossed), there are plenty of other <br/>
&gt; picnic tables outside of the shady pavilion we can spill over to. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you have any interest in joining us for this gathering, please send me <br/>
&gt; an email with the number of people who will attend and your preference for <br/>
&gt; gathering time (late morning, early afternoon, late afternoon). Thanks! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hoping to hear from a lot of you, <br/>
