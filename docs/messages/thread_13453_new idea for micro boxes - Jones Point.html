tube.  The zip lock bags were quite wet inside and out but the tube <br/>
and scrool log were dry inside.<br/>

Do you think this is enough messages yet from me about this box?  :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; we recently bought some m&amp;m minis. they come in a plastic tube <br/>
with a snap<br/>
&gt; &gt; lid. they are about twice the length of a film cannister and <br/>
about the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; diameter. we put paper towel in one and submerged it into a glass <br/>
of water<br/>
&gt; &gt; for about an hour and the paper towel came out bone dry.  we plan <br/>
on<br/>
&gt; &gt; creating a hitch hiker and some micro boxes with these containers.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; HI!  I thought about using them but wondered if I could get the <br/>
smell of m&amp;ms <br/>
&gt; out of the plastic.  Maybe soaking the container in bleach would do <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; trick.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please post a note on how they work out!<br/>
