<br/>
I have received enough interest to make an initial order for merit badges <br/>
(designed using the A from the logo).  There has been a lot of welcome <br/>
discussion of the design but the consensus on those interested in ordering <br/>
has been to use the design as submitted.  <br/>
  Hopefully there will be no hard feelings.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
 The merit badges offered will be F (for found), P (for planted), X (for <br/>
exchanged)<br/>
The denominations will be  10 ,  25,  50,  75,  100,  150,200,250,500,1000<br/>
 The cost is $4.oo per badge.  This includes taxes.  IF we reach 70 ordered <br/>
then I will be able to refund $1 per badge for all orders.    So I am sending <br/>
this out just as a reminder.<br/>
  If you are ordering please send a self addressed stamped envelope along <br/>
with your check and list of merit badges ordered to:<br/>
  Kay Mohmers<br/>
   112  Dale Ave<br/>
    Collinsville IL 62234<br/>
<br/>
I plan on making the order on March 10th.<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>
Happy Hunting<br/>
Mohmers<br/>
<br/>
  PS. After this order they will come in quantities of 10 patches per order <br/>
but for this order I am accepting smaller quantities and will separate them <br/>
for you.   :o)<br/>
