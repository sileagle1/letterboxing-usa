Congratulations!  <br/>
<br/>
Do you think it helped win the Series at all?  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe we need to do something like that in the Chicago area for the <br/>
Cubs. I understand it's been forever for them also.  Maybe a <br/>
letterbox would give them a little push-start?   (Taking a goat to <br/>
Texas the season before may have worked a little but obviously didn't <br/>
get the job done.)<br/>

Chuck already has a Curse of the Billy Goat box in Waterford, CT <br/>
(It's a pretty mean looking billy goat too)  Hasn't helped the Cubs <br/>
yet! LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Hey Chuck, I was just wondering who the last person was that got the <br/>
Curse of the Bambino box before it retired.  Was I the last one?  I <br/>
got there just before dark on Wednesday night.<br/>

I was wondering the same thing...who was the last one to get there.  <br/>
(There were 3 or 4 names on Wed. before mine and i'm sure several <br/>
after it...we were there around 2-2:30)<br/>
