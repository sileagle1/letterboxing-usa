                    <div class="plaintext-content">This past weekend was filled with hunting down some Oregon <br/>
letterboxes.  It started Thursday night when we successfully located <br/>
Der Mad Stamper's Japanese Garden letterbox...and I must say I think <br/>
another letterboxer (gogary?)had been there only seconds before us.  <br/>
We thought we saw a flash of a white t-shirt below us in the bushes <br/>
(lol).  The mosquitoes were doing what they do best - pester us!  <br/>
Anyway...we liked the stamp you chose to put there.  I wanted to try <br/>
to visit some of the dogs (Paisley Orca's boxes), but alas it was <br/>
getting dark and I still had to get home to bake cookies.  We at <br/>
least managed to find the starting location for the next night.<br/>
<br/>
On Friday night, we successfully caught up with Skip (although the <br/>
High Fire Danger sign didn't appear to be there), Fido, and Spot.  We <br/>
missed getting to see Fido.  Amanda - your carvings are wonderful!  <br/>
It was also a good way to stretch our legs after a week of sitting at <br/>
desk jobs.<br/>
<br/>
On our way home we decided to try and squeeze in one more...so we got <br/>
out our map and found the "X" marks the spot - for the location of <br/>
Der Mad Stamper's Lost Letterbox, and successfully found this one in <br/>
the dusk of the night.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we had a successful two nights, but we wanted more, so...<br/>
<br/>
On Saturday we set off to try to find the remaining Rock Creek <br/>
letterboxes that we were missing.  We searched &amp; searched for Mitch's <br/>
Possum's Penthouse Letterbox, but we couldn NOT find it and we are <br/>
wondering if it is still in existence or is it among the missing????<br/>
<br/>
We did manage to find Thom's Coon Cache Letterbox.  Good idea on <br/>
securing it.  The contents of the box were a little damp, so we dried <br/>
them off and gave them a new ziplock bag.<br/>
<br/>
And last but not least, we found Mitch's Dragon letterbox.  The box <br/>
had seen better days - it was still whole and the contents were dry, <br/>
but it looked like it had gone through some weathering.<br/>
<br/>
Whew!  We've been busy, but it is only psyching us up to place our <br/>
own boxes, which we are close to doing.  Stay tuned.<br/>

letterboxes too.<br/>
<br/>
Did you find the Rock Creek #1 box?  I found it today and there <br/>
wasn't a single entry by anyone (including you!) in it!  Apparently, <br/>
it's gone missing before, so perhaps it was replaced recently.  It <br/>
did look like it was in very good condition.  However, the THREE <br/>
stamps in it puzzled me.  What's up with all the stamps?!  I figured <br/>
if they were hitchhikers, they'd need a notepad for themselves, but <br/>
no, it was just the three stamps.  And SHEEZE!  That box is HARD to <br/>
reach!  =)  I found it pretty easily, but it's definitely the hardest <br/>
one I've tried to retrieve so far.  (I kept wishing for those go-go-<br/>
gadget arms.  They would have been very handy!)<br/>
<br/>
I failed to find Possum's Penthouse as well.  I didn't have any idea <br/>
where to start looking for that box, so I just wandered around <br/>
looking for anything "over where I went under".  Didn't see anything <br/>
that seemed to fit, though.<br/>
<br/>
I also wasn't able to find the Coon Cache Letterbox.  That one <br/>
*really* irritated me because I found a couple of trees I was SURE <br/>
was the right place, but nothing.  This one I was beginning to <br/>
suspect might have gone missing, except these clues are so vague it's <br/>
hard to be absolutely sure you're looking in the right spot--even if <br/>
you think you probably are!  =)  Seeing as it was there a week ago, I <br/>
guess it's safe to assume it's still there.  I will definitely have <br/>
to return and look for that one again.  Perhaps I'll see <br/>
something "over where I went under" while looking for it as well.  I <br/>
figure if I can find one of these letterboxes, it'll help in looking <br/>
for the other!<br/>
<br/>
As for the Dragon box, I felt the martian's remains should be <br/>
removed, so they're no longer there.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Did you find the Troll?  I don't remember if you signed into that box <br/>
or not, but I remember one other person had before me which really <br/>
surprised me.  It's so close to the Dragon box, how could someone <br/>
look for one and not the other?  And the one entry in the Troll box <br/>
was from last year!  Are people just not finding it or just not <br/>
looking for it?  There was something like six people who signed into <br/>
the Dragon box, but only one person found the Troll.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I added five more to my F-count, so it was a good day.  <br/>
Visited some parks I didn't even know existed just a few miles from <br/>
my place to boot.  Heck, one of them I've probably driven past a <br/>
hundred times and didn't even know it just zipping on Highway 26, <br/>
ignorant of all the parks loitering on the side!<br/>
<br/>
Another good boxing day.  =)<br/>

We couldn't find Rock Creek #1 box because it was missing or had <br/>
fallen down or something.  We were waiting for it to be put back, so <br/>
we can bag it.  Guess we can go get it now.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
We also bagged "Possum's Penthouse", which Beth actually figured out <br/>
and saved for me to reach in and retrieve.  Gotta love those briar <br/>
bushes in summer, eh?  The contents were water logged so we replaced <br/>
the zip lock bags.<br/>
<br/>
"Coon Cache" was missing from where we think it was supposed to have <br/>
been, and we've sent a note to the owner but no response as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
As for the "Dragon" and "Troll" boxes we decided we would rather hunt <br/>
for boxes that have a bit more of a challenge, than walk 20 paces and <br/>
look "xx".  So, we bagged the Dragon, but left the Troll for those <br/>
who like miscellaneous hunting.<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget to check out the "Japanese Gardens box" and "The Lost <br/>
Box", and also the "PCC Rock Creek" series are fun.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be getting our own series of boxes out soon to add to the fun.<br/>
