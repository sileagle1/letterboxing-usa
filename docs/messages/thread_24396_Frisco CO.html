The lodge pole beetle has devastated the area and extensive tree-<br/>
clearing has changed the clue points. Same stamp, second logbook, <br/>
updated clues. Enjoy! <br/>

Difficulty: Kid friendly.<br/>
<br/>
An area of land in Frisco is referred to by the locals as The  <br/>
Peninsula. White River National Forest is on part of The Peninsula, <br/>
but the letterbox is located outside of the gate on city property so  <br/>
as to "leave no trace". Due to infestation of lodge pole beetles, the <br/>
area underwent extensive tree-clearing, but the younger trees and the <br/>
hike to Lake Dillon still make this a worthwhile visit.<br/>
