                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went out for a great day of letterboxing with Butterfly &amp; Angel.  <br/>
We went up to meet the Oxen Traveler on the trail.  We caught up with <br/>
the oxen on the trail just before Rt 203.  The oxen were moving right <br/>
along and were very well behaved.   This was my first hike with <br/>
oxen... a new experience.  Best of luck to Carol &amp; her "pack" on the <br/>
rest of their journey.<br/>
<br/>
After the oxen hike we headed down to Norwich to Mohegan Park for the <br/>
Indian and the Fountain boxes.  If you have not been to this park it <br/>
is a lovely place.  Sadly I must report that box #2 appears to be <br/>
missing.  The other boxes are all ok.  <br/>
<br/>
And ......<br/>
<br/>
I found my 100th found letterbox here!  I started letterboxing <br/>
exactly 4 months ago.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails to all,<br/>
