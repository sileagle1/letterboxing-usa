                    <div class="plaintext-content">Location:  Winton Woods, Winton Road, Cincinnati, Ohio<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Take I-275 to Winton Road-Forest Park exit, south on <br/>
Winton Road to park entrances on left and right.  Also accessible via <br/>
Ronald Reagan-Cross County Highway to Winton Road exit, north on <br/>
Winton Road to park entrances.<br/>
<br/>
Level:  Easy find, level 4 trail<br/>
<br/>
Need:  Stamp, stamp pad, compass<br/>
<br/>
Enter park by the Winton Center/Ranger Station.  Follow road west to <br/>
Great Oak Trail sign.  From the trailhead follow the trail to the <br/>
fork.  Take a compass reading of 90 degrees and proceed along the <br/>
trail.  After the trail turns to the left and down the steps, <br/>
continue to where the trail "cuts" through the downed hollow tree.   <br/>
Go 6 paces and take a reading of 225 degrees.  You will see a large <br/>
downed tree against an upright tree.  Behind the juncture of the two <br/>
will be the Great Oaks box.<br/>
