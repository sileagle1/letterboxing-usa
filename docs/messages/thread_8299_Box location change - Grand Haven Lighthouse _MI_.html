had cut all of the weeds along the breakwall rocks, leaving the box <br/>
much more vulnerable to being accidentally discovered, and also being <br/>
buried with snow.  I have moved the box just a bit from the original <br/>
hiding spot so it is better concealed and more prepared to weather <br/>
winter.  I was happy to see that 5 people have stamped in since it <br/>
was placed in August ;-)<br/>
