ADDITIONAL NOTES:<br/>
<br/>
I reconn'd this site again today and there are quite a few picnic<br/>
tables scattered around this park with a handful under the pavilion <br/>
adjacent the playground. The only 2 grills in the park are out of <br/>
order (part of the renovation).  The pavilion was not reserved as of <br/>
3pm today--so it'll be first come first served tomorrow.  I'll be <br/>
there at 2pm--hopefully, some other folks will join me then to <br/>
secure some tables.  I noticed 4 electrical outlets in the pavilion <br/>
but I have no clue if they're functioning.  Portajohns are on site--<br/>
more civilized facilities are available closer into the village if <br/>
needed.<br/>
<br/>
The RSVP list continues to grow--we're somewhere around 50 now!  It <br/>
will be a lot of fun to meet so many new letterboxers from the <br/>
Pacific Northwest &amp; a few long distance guests, too!  Oh, it'll also <br/>
be mid-low tide so exploring the beach may be another activity folks <br/>
can do.<br/>
<br/>
While reconning the site today &amp; placing a couple of letterboxes--<br/>
the mega-rains came!  The park literally went from about 75% full &amp; <br/>
teeming with people to just my son &amp; me within about 5 minutes.  The <br/>
pavilion, however, kept things high &amp; dry.  If the weather gets <br/>
substantially 'violent' tomorrow, we'll head to the food court at <br/>
the Sea Tac Mall.  I'm sure I'm forgetting some other details.  <br/>
Please chime in if you see anything I've omitted.<br/>
<br/>
See you all tomorrow!!!<br/>
