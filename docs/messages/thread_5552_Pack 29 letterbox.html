                    <html><body>My Tiger and Bear cubscouts planted their first letterbox today on a hike in Foothill Park, Windsor CA.<br/>
<br/>
Take Hwy. 101 north past Santa Rosa to Windsor, the Arata exit.  Go east or right on Arata and drive down a couple miles to Foothill Park  (on your left).  This park has very easy trails for kids, three lakes and plenty of wildlife.<br/>
<br/>
Head up through the main entrance until you come to a fork-- with several options.  Take the main trail and veer to the right until you stumble upon the first lake.  Head east on the three lakes trail and keep on it as you watch your compass going northeast and east and then north until you spot lake number two.  If you go northwest about 22 paces you may be rewarded with a place to rest and more...  or you can get sidetracked catching frogs... mind the log!</body></html>
