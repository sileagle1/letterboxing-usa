<br/>
I have stood by and watched these personal attacks on innocent and <br/>
good people. This is NOT letterboxing or the intent of this list. <br/>
There was a time when new boxers could LEARN from this list or <br/>
veteran boxers could SHARE here. This has all gone out the window in <br/>
recent months.<br/>
<br/>
With this latest rash of flames, I call upon Randy and Jay to somehow <br/>
monitor these posts, and if need be, censor them! I cannot believe I <br/>
have suggested this but ENOUGH IS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!<br/>
<br/>
I urge fellow letterboxers of like mind to email both Jay and Randy <br/>
before this list gets totally out of control. We are loosing and have <br/>
lost many good letterboxers from this list. It's time to take back <br/>
control of this list.<br/>

"Plant a new Truffula...<br/>
Treat it with care...<br/>

Grow a forest...<br/>
Protect it from axes that hack...<br/>
Then the Lorax and all of his friends may come back.<br/>

Strangely appropriate, I think. Just substitute a few words and we have a <br/>
mantra for rebuilding the good will on this list. I, too, miss it.<br/>

Peace to all!<br/>
