Killingworth, CT, we would like to sweep a few special friends away on the waves of our <br/>
own little "minor mystery"!  A couple of years ago, we first had the idea to invite fellow <br/>
letterboxers along on a cruise we were taking to the Bahamas.  We posted a message to <br/>
the LbNA"big list" in the fall of 2004 (see our clip from message # 47368 on Nov 10, 2004 <br/>
at the bottom of this post), because  we thought it was such a good deal  - only $249 <br/>
(plus taxes) for a 4-night cruise, including port charges for 3 different islands, all food, <br/>
accommodations, entertainment, and possibly even a few letterbox plants on board and <br/>
along the way! (We did pick up quite a fine bunch of boxes at ports of call in Key West  on <br/>
our last couple of cruises!)<br/>
<br/>
Well, over the past several years we've seen quite a few even better cruise deals, and would <br/>
like to share one we're considering doing as our fourth cruise together ( and sixth for me <br/>
overall - not bad for a person prone to motion sickness!) for January of 2007. Granted, <br/>
some people may desire fancier quarters, more hobnobbing with the "hoi polloi" and <br/>
spending more time "at sea"... but as landlubbers who prefer spending our precious <br/>
daylight hours exploring islands, heading out for some local hiking and letterboxing, and <br/>
mainly using the ship as a place to royally eat and  sleep, this cruise certainly seems to "fit <br/>
the bill" for us! It's a "loveboat-style" cruise, 4-nights with full-day stops at a beautiful <br/>
island, a lovely city, and a foreign country, with time for a little bit of "mystery letterbox <br/>
cruising" both before and after the actual cruise itself! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if anyone's is interested in working out these details with us, just search around <br/>
for the lowest price offered for this particular cruise (hint: it's well below the price of that <br/>
last cruise we mentioned!) This will start your trip off on a good bearing. (I just checked <br/>
schedules again, and the price did just go up $5, but that should not appreciably affect <br/>
your standing!) On that note, take steps to find out how many letters there are listed in the <br/>
cruise line's good name (this, too, hardly matters, since we've traveled on five different <br/>
cruise lines so far, and find that we pretty much enjoy them all!) The only question then <br/>
remains to find the starting point for this cruise. Most of the time you will find this ship <br/>
docked near its home port of "New Beginnings", but for its maiden voyage, we hope to be <br/>
announcing its first port of call tomorrow at the "Gathering of Mysteries" in Killingworth, <br/>
CT!  Bon voyage, and au revoir!<br/>

"And speaking of cruises, we did actually sign up for another one just<br/>
the other day! It was too good of a deal to pass up - 5 days<br/>
of "Royal Caribbean" out of Miami for under $300, so we thought we'd<br/>
pass that on to anyone else who might be interested in joining us in<br/>
the latter part of January! We immediately thought of fun folks like<br/>
Don and Gwen, the Doubtful Guests, and many others who could turn<br/>
that ship into quite a letterboxing "Party Line", with boxes hidden<br/>
on islands along the way and maybe even a few on board the ship, too!<br/>
Plus fun things always happen on cruises anyway, like last time I<br/>
actually won a pearl necklace just for singing a few lines of a song!<br/>
So we really are hoping some old or new letterboxing friends will be<br/>
able to come aboard and get the party hopping! Please let us know off-<br/>
line if you're interested, and we'll be glad to send you the details!"<br/>
