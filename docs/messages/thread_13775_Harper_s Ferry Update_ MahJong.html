his cartoon style is great fun to color.<br/>

Night Owl and I would be interested in joining a Leesburg outing.  I <br/>
have done them all but Night Owl has not.  (and I know some short <br/>
cuts :-)<br/>
<br/>
MahJong?!,  Do you play?  We do and would like to get together.  <br/>
(Imaginging MahJong letterbox.)  We all kept trying to visualize <br/>
what your stamp was.<br/>

&gt; &gt; have you done any of the Leesburg boxes yet?  Ryan and I were <br/>
just <br/>

&gt; The Doubtful Guests and Knights of Columbo took Ryan to the Balls <br/>
