Hikers &amp; Hounds are happy to announce our very first planted boxes in beautiful Bensalem, Pa. Clues are posted on the website. Also I have changed email address for this list from my personal, ireneemartin, to this new address for my team. I deleted my old LBNA membership and we are now officially Hikers &amp; Hounds.<br/>
<br/>
A HUGE thank you to Dan and Joyce Kelly - TEAM KELLY - for meeting us in the chilly winter weather to "test drive" our clues and be the first to stamp our boxes. We really had a great time and appreciate them answering all of our questions. Really great people. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck on your search and hope to meet you all on the trail some day!<br/>

Well - If you went to all the trouble of planting them in this Frigid Weather, I <br/>
can at least bother to hunt them down, eh?<br/>
<br/>
I also hope to see you at the Gathering on the 29th. Do you think you'll be <br/>
able to make it?<br/>
