stamp but not alot diffrent. Also planting one on Oakland NC next <br/>
week. I'll let you know the clues then. Already made the stamp.<br/>

Let's Visit Southport NC<br/>
Take a nice drive down Howe Street toward the<br/>
Atlantic Ocean. Before making it to the water stop at the light at <br/>
the intersection and take a left on to Moore St. Take some time and <br/>
see what's in the antique shops. When you have found some good <br/>
bargins head back down Moore street with the ocean to your right. <br/>
You'll arrive at the main entrance of "Old<br/>
Smithville". The first home is dated back to 1804 however earlier <br/>
ones are assumed. This is a peacful community so lets be kind and <br/>
respectful and not "Step on anyones toes". Walk toward the Fake tree <br/>
trunk. Before you reach it you'll pass the home sweet home of "PETER <br/>
SCALES". He's an old man, so if he doesn't say hello don't be hurt. <br/>
Ater passing his home take a left with the ocean to your back. Please <br/>
be quite passing "MARY AMANDA" home. She is ussally resting quietly.<br/>
Isn't her cradle so naturaly lovely? Now lets go on. Take a moment to <br/>
visit the "BROWN"family. "CAPT BROWN" is very proud of haveing the <br/>
tallest iron fence in the nieghborhood. From the front door of the <br/>
Browns continue on with your back still to the ocean toward the large <br/>
oak tree in the center of the nieghborhood. Pass between the homes <br/>
of "JAMES ANDLAURA CHURCH" and"JOSEPH SKERRITT" Now remember this is <br/>
a quite neighborhood lets respect thier homes. "KEEP OFF" signs<br/>
are not allowed just common knowledge.Continue on past "MOTHER ELLA <br/>
GILBERT" toward the gate opening of the community at the end of Old <br/>
Smithville.Where "MELVIN AND MARY LEWIS" home lies. And there you <br/>
will find the letterbox in thier lovely foilage.Please becareful and <br/>
not distrub them. I hope you have a good time looking<br/>
for this letterbox. I had a good time planting it. Happy hunting and <br/>
