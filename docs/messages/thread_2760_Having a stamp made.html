I took my design to a stamp and sign company, and asked for it to be made <br/>
self-inking.  The actual design is only about 1 1/2 inches, but the <br/>
self-inking mechanism they put it in is huge - can't tuck it into my cargo <br/>
pants or even the net pouch on my Camelbak.<br/>

<br/>
The other problem with self-inkers is that they are self-inking.<br/>
Usually I just use my stamp with a plain-old stamp pad, but if it's a<br/>
nice day and I brought a lot of my better letterboxing stuff I'll<br/>
colorize my custom stamp (it's fairly elaborate) with different<br/>
colors, painting the pigment on with a brush. <br/>

Yup!  If I had known about pigment brushes (which look just like tiny oval <br/>
stamp pads), I would have not spent $22 on a self-inking stamp which A. <br/>
takes up too much space, and B. leaves me with only red ink!<br/>

use water-based markers and color directly on the stamp -- can color<br/>
different things different colors that way, like leaves green and flowers<br/>
yellow.  Just scribble with the side of the marker.  Good ones to use are<br/>
Marvy LePlume's or Tombows .. they run around $1-$2 each (can buy them in<br/>
sets at local craft stores), and they are double sided (thick side and thin<br/>
side) so you don't have to carry a separate pen.<br/>
<br/>
They are not waterproof, however, if that's a concern.  However, that's what<br/>
I plan on using, because I can just throw 2 or 3 markers in my pack and not<br/>
worry about lids coming off of inkpads, etc..<br/>

I saw your stamp when we found the Pt. Defiance Letterbox on Saturday.<br/>
It's really a nifty design!  Just wanted to let you know.<br/>

He asked me to just write down 10-12 words I thought described me, and from <br/>
those he picked out Scorpio, the moon (see the stinger?), the mountains, and <br/>
the trails I love.<br/>
