off we went...  Took a nice little nature hike to uncover another box;<br/>
and looking through their logbook, saw that Wanda &amp; Pete were up in our<br/>
neck of the woods (we met at the Rocky Neck gathering) just yesterday!<br/>
Makes it seem like a small world! (What kind of race was happening at<br/>
Wolfe Neck?)<br/>
To any Mainers... what about having an "Event" up this way??<br/>

Hi Memlili:  We were not too far from home when we found the box at
Skofield Preserve, in Brunswick.  The temp. was in the 50's, just
right, and no bugs.   Have you been to this area looking for
boxes?

<div>Other than the Hancock County area, mostly Mount Desert 
Island, my only other boxes have been Nubble Light and Seacoast, both fairly 
easy and in very pretty places.  I need to get farther afield!  It was 
a great day to be out.  I planted a new box - soon to post the clues.  
Have another couple to get out soon.</div>

Yes, we did happen to be up in Maine this past long weekend! <br/>
Got up to Freeport on Friday night, and took a nice little walk <br/>
along Casco Bay by moonlight, but thought we'd wait for morning <br/>
for more letterboxing.  Nothing doing! - a big running race was <br/>
going on near Wolf Neck Woods, and we couldn't get anywhere <br/>
near the place! We scooted off to Skofield Preserve in nearby <br/>
Brunswick, did a few non-letterbox nature walks, and then the <br/>
delightful Boothbay area boxes. Had a pleasant visit with <br/>
RIBNAG Ben and Laura, whose new box in the Blue Hills area <br/>
we visited on the way home, along with several others, but not <br/>
before a brief foray onto Mount Desert Island for a couple of <br/>
legerdemaines and the Algerine Coast.   Algerine was a little <br/>
damp but dried out OK.<br/>
<br/>
It was a lovely little vacation break, with great weather, too, and <br/>
we'll be looking forward to getting back up there again <br/>
sometime, but for now we are turning our attention southwards!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and cheers,<br/>
Wanda and Pete<br/>
