Search for the first box was confusing for us, as there were so many crosstrails and spurs.  Must be that we didn't follow the correct ones so that the clues would link together.  Yikes!  Would have been more determined, but I was the only stamper and letterboxer.  Others were tag-alongs who weren't as enthralled with the idea of trekking around in the 90-plus degree heat and humidity!<br/>

99.999% sure we found the right location for the second box, but it wasn't at the site.<br/>

Keep me posted.  I'd like to hear about your journey.  My friend would like to look again.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to be down in Cinci in August for Stampaway convention in mid-August.  Already have my letterboxes marked on the city map!<br/>

I was the first person to stamp into these boxes, about a year ago. I had the<br/>
same problems with the first box. The woods behind the turtle fountain is so<br/>
criss-crossed with trails. I finally gave up, and in walking up the paved path<br/>
from the large bridge, I spotted the smaller bridge and the boxes resting<br/>
place. I doubt if it could be found accidentally and would be surprised if it<br/>
is not still there.<br/>
<br/>
The second box was much easier. You walk along the river from the parking<br/>
area, come to a small open field, and the log containing the box is directly<br/>
across the field from you. Of course, there is always the chance that the log<br/>
pile had been removed.<br/>
<br/>
This probably doesn;t help much, but at least confirms that the boxes were<br/>
there as of last summer.<br/>
