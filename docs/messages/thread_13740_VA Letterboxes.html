we could never find and finding 1 (in Redwing Park) which had no stamp, we <br/>
FINALLY found a letterbox with a stamp in it.  Our first one. This was one of <br/>
five of the Dead Authors Letterboxes in Vienna, VA. The directions were great. We <br/>
stopped after Louisa May Alcott's box because our 80 yr. old father had <br/>
decided to join us and he got tired and his knees started to bother him. But he was <br/>
very impressed when I reach to retrieve the box and actually came out with <br/>
something. The box is quite dry and the book is almost filled. It is starting on <br/>
the back of the sheets now since one side is full. It was so interesting <br/>
looking at other peoples stamps.  I think there was a HH in there at one time.<br/>
     On our way back to VA Beach we stopped at VA 108 Rest Stop. The Microbox <br/>
is still there. It looks like 3-4 stamps were put in just this weekend. <br/>
Again, your directions were great and your box was dry. <br/>
     Both of these Letterboxes were planted by: Daughter of the Old Dominion<br/>
                                              Thank you,<br/>
