&gt; I have planted my first letterbox near the Joyce Kilmer Memorial <br/>
Forest in <br/>
&gt; Graham County, NC.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Forest is about 14 miles from Robbinsville, the nearest town.  <br/>
&gt; (Robbinsville is about 2 hours west of Asheville - take I-40 west <br/>
to Exit <br/>
&gt; 27, then follow Great Smoky Mountain Expressway on US19 South; pass <br/>
Cherokee <br/>
&gt; and Bryson City, then watch for the Robbinsville sign just before <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; Nantahala Gorge).  There is USFS camping nearby on Santeelah Creek.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The trail is not steep or difficult, but is not suitable for <br/>
wheelchairs or <br/>
&gt; strollers or street footwear; ankle supporting shoes/boots are best.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Follow the signs from Robbinsville to the Forest.  Drive to the <br/>
parking lot <br/>
&gt; and find the information kiosk which shows the map and the <br/>
famous "Trees" <br/>
&gt; poem by Joyce Kilmer.  Then follow the clues:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the edge of "You Are Here,"<br/>
&gt; North 23 paces, have no fear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cross not the Bridge, but up the Rail<br/>
&gt; Into green and mossy vale.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Up step and root, past hidey-hole,<br/>
&gt; Watch for lizard, mouse, and mole.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rotten log and slippery bridge<br/>
&gt; Left is Creek, right is Ridge.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At the Y sign what you wear<br/>
&gt; Will decide which way you bear!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Right if clothed, left if naked -<br/>
&gt; This is the CRUX - will you make it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Up and pass (all on the left)<br/>
&gt; These clues of Nature, some bereft:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ONE is hemlocks side by side<br/>
&gt; TWO is long low mossy pride<br/>
&gt; THREE is upright velvety shady<br/>
&gt; FOUR is Mama and her Babies<br/>
&gt; FIVE the Head-High Hollow find<br/>
&gt; SIX the Three-in-One do twine<br/>
&gt; SEVEN will be Downed &amp; Quartered<br/>
&gt; (this by Man, but what's that matter?)<br/>
&gt; EIGHT a Perfect Letterbox Tree<br/>
&gt; (Alas, too close to path for Thee!!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, but NINE! What have we here?<br/>
&gt; Aha! Our treasure box is near!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cross the Curvy Wet but STOP!<br/>
&gt; The nubby shoe-sized stump's your lot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From little stump eleven pace,<br/>
&gt; THEN 340 on your "face."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pace up and 20; you will see<br/>
&gt; A straight and upright Hugging Tree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is it; now be discreet,<br/>
&gt; Find the purple twixt her feet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do not call; do not knock.<br/>
&gt; Kiss the tree and move the Rock.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you've stamped, Ladies and Gents,<br/>
&gt; Return to the Loop to visit the Ents.<br/>
