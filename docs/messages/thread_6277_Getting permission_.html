Thought this was interesting since we've had this sort of discussion <br/>
about asking permission before.  Seems, at least in PA, that <br/>
geocachers have started this process, but I'm not sure it is a good <br/>
thing for many reasons...  Thoughts??  The draft of the permission <br/>
form can be found through the above link.<br/>

At Groundspeak, we recently received a letter [copied below] <br/>
regarding permission to place caches in Pennsylvania State Parks. For <br/>
future reference, permission to place caches may be requested from <br/>
the contact person for the Bureau of State Parks: Charlie Meade Park <br/>
Manager Operations Section Harrisburg, PA (717) 787-2191 <br/>
cmeade@state.pa.us <br/>
<br/>
Here is the original letter:<br/>
<br/>
Dear Sirs:<br/>
I am Ranger Supervisor Richard Fischer of Presque Isle State Park in <br/>
Erie County, PA. I would like to advise you the Department of <br/>
Conservation and Natural Resources, Bureau of State Parks, requires <br/>
the person(s) who establish a cache location in a Pennsylvania state <br/>
park must first attain permission to do so. Geocaching Guidelines as <br/>
well as a registration form are available at any state park. Without <br/>
these forms the establishment of a cache is prohibited. Please pass <br/>
this information on to your geocaching community.<br/>
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.<br/>
Richard Fischer - rfischer@state.pa.us <br/>
