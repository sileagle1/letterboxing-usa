Planted: September 2, 2002 by yooperann (wfisher47@attbi.com)<br/>
Terrain: Level<br/>
Difficulty: Easy, family oriented<br/>
Stamp: homemade, and a pretty crude first try. But it's appropriate <br/>
to the setting.      <br/>
<br/>
Setting:   Geneva is an old mill town on the Fox River, about 40 <br/>
miles west of Chicago's loop.  It has maintained its historic <br/>
character and has a compact and interesting downtown shopping and<br/>
restaurant district. Its festivals, which include Swedish days in <br/>
June, an art fair in July, a wine and food festival in September, and <br/>
a Swedish Christmas Walk, provide additional excuses for a<br/>
visit.  We especially enjoy the annual two-day Fox Valley Folk Music <br/>
and Storytelling Festival, held over the Labor Day weekend.  An <br/>
additional attraction for letterboxers is an American<br/>
Science and Surplus Store, located about two miles east of downtown <br/>
on Route 38.  <br/>
<br/>
	Island Park is on the Fox River, in the heart of Geneva.  It <br/>
is a lovely shaded park, with cedar-chipped playgrounds, trees <br/>
slanting over the river for daring kids to walk out on, lots of<br/>
fishing spots, ducks to feed, and one of the region's best bike <br/>
paths, the 33 mile Fox River Trail, which in turn connects to the 55 <br/>
mile Illinois Prairie Path.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:   Geneva is at the intersection of Illinois Highways 31 and <br/>
38, about half way between Interstate 88 and Interstate 90.  But you <br/>
don't have to drive if you don't want to.  Chicago's<br/>
commuter train, Metra, (Northwest Line) will take you from downtown <br/>
Chicago to downtown Geneva (and less than half a mile from the <br/>
letterbox) in just over an hour. Island Park is on the<br/>
east bank of the Fox River, just south of State Street (Route 38). <br/>
<br/>
Island Park has four bridges associated with it, two large bridges <br/>
over the Fox River and two smaller ones that take you on and off the <br/>
island.  Locate the two-level bridge where you can<br/>
cross on foot, by bike, or in cars, but never in automobiles.  Your <br/>
quest for the letterbox begins at the east end of that bridge.   <br/>
<br/>
You will be at a spot where four bike paths meet.   Two of them run <br/>
along a chain link fence with barbed wire at the top.  Follow the <br/>
path that will put the fence on your right.  As you come<br/>
to a sign warning of ice and steep slopes, leave the chain link fence <br/>
to take a path that will put a split rail fence on your right (much <br/>
more attractive, and appropriate for Illinois, the home of the<br/>
world's most famous rail splitter, Abraham Lincoln).   Follow that <br/>
fence to its end and then stop. <br/>
