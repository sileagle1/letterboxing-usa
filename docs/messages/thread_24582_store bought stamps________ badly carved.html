&gt; I do find this topic fascinating, as I don't care even if the box<br/>

&gt; agree, BTW, I don't care for store bought stamps either).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My question is: How do people feel about hand-carved stamps that<br/>
&gt; make no attempt to be artistic.  That is, just represent proof<br/>
&gt; that they found the box.  Like some carving that says: "I found<br/>
&gt; really really really really impossible box X"?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'll admit that my reluctance to carve a stamp relating to the<br/>
&gt; place stems from the fact that I prefer to create clues to mystery<br/>
&gt; boxes, and a stamp image that represents the place of a mystery<br/>
&gt; box is an information leak.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just curious.<br/>

I haven't seen any poorly carved stamps yet. I don't think its possibleto do a poorly carved stamp.
