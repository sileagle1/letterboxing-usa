Yesterday, I went through and added all my boxes through the letter C.<br/>
They're spread all over the country. After doing all those entries, I<br/>
found out that many of them were duplicates. I deleted them and gave<br/>
up. Do I just let the webmasters enter everything and only reclaim<br/>
them if I need to edit? Help! Funhog<br/>

choose 'view all boxes.'  This shows all currently entered boxes, <br/>
organized within city, within county, within state.<br/>

But I have a feeling you are looking for an alaphabetized list of all <br/>
boxes (not ordered within state)?  I was able to copy the list of all <br/>
the boxes and paste it into Excel and then sort by box name.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of a round about way, but it worked.  I can e-mail you the list <br/>
if you would like.<br/>

I hope everyone keeps in mind that switching internet sites is a grueling job, and it will take a lot of adjustment and patience on our parts.  I hope that everyone knows that it will be well worth it when everything is finally up and running.  Just be patient :-)<br/>

Maybe I can help you out if you need something explained.  It's not hard to <br/>
do--I think Music Woman was just saying that it would be hard for the <br/>
webmasters to have to enter every clue (because there are so many)--not for <br/>
each of us to enter our own.<br/>
