<br/>
My 10 yo reads the clues and directs us. My 5 yo listens and helps to look as well. When we feel we are close we all look together. No one touches it until we have evaluated the spot and then usually my 10 yo will pull it out. He also will rehide it and then I will check again to make sure it is well hidden. (Usually he does pretty good...I do better!) hehehe<br/>
<br/>
Even on my first trip as a newbie we did it this way. It's just common sense. It felt like a special spy mission. We waited for anyone in the area to leave and kept looking over our shoulders. It was great fun! <br/>
<br/>
The fact that we evaluate the situation first also speaks towards safety. I don't want my son reaching into crevices without first evaluating for hidden dangers. <br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails!<br/>
