LB'ing today so they are forcing me to go cross country skiing with <br/>
them tomorrow.  Actually with the conditions as wonderful as they are <br/>
and the promise of going to Windblown (my favorite area) I didn't <br/>
need too much persuasion.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, for any letterboxers left in the RI area I leave the <br/>
following new letterbox at one of the most beautiful coastal spots in <br/>
RI - Black Point.<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails.<br/>

Midnight on the Moon<br/>
Black Point<br/>
Narragansett, RI<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  An easy one mile round trip to Black Point, overlooking <br/>
Scarborough Beach.  A perfect walk at any time of year but be extra <br/>
careful when the rocks are wet.<br/>
<br/>
Clue Difficulty: Easy. <br/>
<br/>
Background:  Black Point is a rugged section of rocky shoreline just <br/>
north of Scarborough Beach in Narragansett.  It has spectacular ocean <br/>
views and surprisingly few black rocks. .  The day that we placed the <br/>
letterbox the seas were rough and we stopped to admire the four to <br/>
six foot rollers crashing into the rocks.  It is used year round by <br/>
fisherman and hikers alike.  Though it is a DEM controlled fishing <br/>
access and is supposed to only be used during daylight hours, the <br/>
bluffs can be a romantic place for a stroll on a full moon, but only <br/>
if you are familiar with the area and don't stray too close to the <br/>
rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From Rt 1 in Wakefield take Rt 108 south through <br/>
Narragansett.  In a few miles stay in the left lane and look for a <br/>
sign on the right side indicating a left turn at the light to <br/>
Scarborough Beach (Burnside Ave).  Burnside "T's" onto Ocean Ave and <br/>
Scarborough Beach will be to your right.  Turn left onto Ocean Ave <br/>
and continue for approximately 0.4 miles to the Black Point Fishing <br/>
Access parking area on your right.  <br/>
<br/>
The trail to the bluffs will be to the left of the information sign.  <br/>
It is a short walk down to the water from there.  When you see the <br/>
water stay to the right on the trail that goes through the grasses on <br/>
the top of the cliff.  This trail will parallel the coast and tidal <br/>
rocks all the way to Black Point.  Continue on the trail for almost <br/>
half a mile.  When the trail opens up at the end of Black Point there <br/>
will be a large, waist high rock immediately on your right at 340 o.  <br/>
You will be able to see the Narragansett water tower at 240 o and the <br/>
Point Judith lighthouse far off in the distance at 215 o.  Look back <br/>
to your right at 0o to find the largest scrub pine around about 15 <br/>
yards away.  The base of the pine contains your goal.<br/>
<br/>
Take your time returning to your car and explore the wonderful rocks <br/>
and tidal pools on the way back.  Be careful of the rocks, they can <br/>
lots of fun but also quite slippery and dangerous.<br/>
