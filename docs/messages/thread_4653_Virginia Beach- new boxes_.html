Redwing Park (2)<br/>
Virginia Beach, VA<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Redwing Park is located in Virginia Beach at 1398 General Booth <br/>
Boulevard, not far from the Oceanfront.  These boxes are very near <br/>
the Flame of Hope stamp on <br/>
Oceana Boulevard. After stamping in at the Flame of Hope continue <br/>
south on Oceana Boulevard until the major intersection with General <br/>
Booth Boulevard.  Take a right onto General Booth.  Redwing Park is <br/>
almost immediately on your left.  If you miss the turn, continue down <br/>
to the intersection of General Booth and Dam Neck Road.  A U turn <br/>
here will bring you back by the park. <br/>
<br/>
 Bring a lunch to enjoy in the picnic area after stamping in.  There <br/>
is a nice small playground for the kids to burn off extra energy as <br/>
well as a playground for your pooch, too!  <br/>
<br/>
Park in the first parking lot to your left as you enter the park.  <br/>
You may wish to enjoy the Japanese and Rose gardens before beginning <br/>
your search. Cross the road and enter the Redwing Gardens.  The <br/>
Garden Gnome eagerly awaits your arrival.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Garden Gnome<br/>
Start your search at the Redwing Gardens sign just inside the ivy <br/>
garlanded white fence.  Before you lay four different paths.  Which <br/>
one to take to visit with the Garden Gnome?  Take the 1st paved trail <br/>
heading east.  Stay on this trail for a little while until two <br/>
bridges come into sight.  <br/>
<br/>
Under one bridge lives the evil troll.  Some say the metal railings <br/>
of his bridge act as a lightning rod causing him to be hit many times <br/>
over the years by these terrifying bolts. This has surely caused a <br/>
bit of his insanity and outright meaness. He is not to be disturbed <br/>
at any cost as he most certainly is not a gracious host!  Beware!<br/>
<br/>
Under the other bridge lives our kindly Gnome.  He spends his time <br/>
tending the gardens in Redwing Park.  The wooden construction of his <br/>
home keeps him safe during storms.   You'll find your treasure<br/>
hidden <br/>
under the end of the bridge nearest the picnic shelters and within <br/>
sight of the troll's home.  Be careful, as this can be slippery<br/>
when <br/>
wet.  After stamping in carefully rehide the box.<br/>
<br/>
Redwing Park Stamp<br/>
<br/>
Once you have stamped in move toward the center of the bridge. Facing <br/>
the troll's bridge, look at your stamped image. The Garden Gnome <br/>
points the way to your next find!  (Or, standing in the center of the <br/>
bridge, take a bearing of 260 degrees).<br/>
<br/>
Continue on your journey by following the paved path to your left.  <br/>
The Garden Gnome would like you to enjoy the many flowering bushes <br/>
and trees as you go.  Soon you will come upon a stone-encased water <br/>
fountain/bubbler on your right.  Continue this path to the Fragrance <br/>
Gardens.  The Fragrance Gardens were planted especially for the blind <br/>
to enjoy but we're sure you will enjoy the beautiful smells, too.<br/>
<br/>
Take a moment to smell the Dwarf Gardenia, the Pitosporum, the Lilac <br/>
and the Anise bushes. Find the Ligstrum bush and take a bearing of 32 <br/>
degrees to the paved path.  Follow the paved path bearing to the left <br/>
as it meanders around the topiary.  Before reaching the covered <br/>
wishing well you will see a gravel path to your right.  Take the <br/>
gravel path.  Shortly you must decide which path to choose.<br/>
<br/>
At the intersection of many paths take a bearing of 100 degrees.  20 <br/>
paces ahead you will find the Mrs. C.L. Hershberger crepe myrtle <br/>
memorial tree.  From here locate the "U" shaped tree.  At the<br/>
"U" <br/>
shaped tree follow the gravel path to the right until it connects <br/>
again with the paved path. Take a left onto this path. Continue on, <br/>
bearing left to your second gravel path on the left.  Nestled within <br/>
the trees here (bearing 350 degrees) is a bench to take a rest.  <br/>
While sitting on the bench locate the pair of trees growing together <br/>
to your left.  You'll find the Redwing Park stamp hidden under<br/>
the <br/>
pine needles in a small cubby at the base of the tree nearest to the <br/>
bench.  Stamp in and rehide well. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy! :o)<br/>
