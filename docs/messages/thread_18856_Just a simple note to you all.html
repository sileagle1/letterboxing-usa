It takes a big man to admit that he has made a mistake, especially in <br/>
such a large forum as this. One error in judgement should not negate <br/>
all the great things you have done to promote and improve this game. <br/>
<br/>
You have shown us how to carve; now you have shown us how to admit <br/>
our mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

Hi Brian,<br/>
<br/>
Having the luxury of knowing you In Real Life (tm), I know how keenly <br/>
and deeply you must feel to offer this apology.  It is not taken <br/>
lightly.  We all make mistakes.  Not all have the integrity to admit <br/>
them.  Thankfully, you have integrity.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm warning you!  Next time I'm gonna have to whup you upside the <br/>
head (after I find a chair to stand on, that is) ;-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; It's a good thing you only did it once. If you do that twice in one <br/>
&gt; &gt; hour, I think they have to, like, kill a newbie or something.<br/>

&gt; If someone wants to kill a newbie, they will have to go through me <br/>
&gt; first.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Before posting this I went back and reread the Lemony Snicket post that Brian wrote and subsequently apologized for writing. Now I don't intend to rehash/reflame anything , but I would suggest to all that flamed about his post to reread it. Frankly I read very little to apologize for. Brian did not attack any one by name, at least that I could figure out, but spelled out some frustration about reading the same questions over and over and subsequent answers over and over. He may have not maintained a PC attitude, but the content certainly out weighed any lack of tact a reader found.  His post prompted some interchange that helped create something new; "Resources for New LBNA Members"(see post #40929 by Steve &amp; Heidi). Now if only we can get folks to follow the guidelines that Steve &amp; Heidi wrote about then maybe some of the repetition will dissipate. For those that want to jump in and help new folks figure out stuff please contact them directly or just refer them to a link. Brian no apology is needed only your passion for our hobby.<br/>
