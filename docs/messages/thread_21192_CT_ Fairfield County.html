box wasn't on the site (along with a bunch of other from today). I tried to<br/>
add it again under my login as a test and it didn't work. Time to call the<br/>
server doctor!<br/>

&gt; New letterbox: Swiper Goes Fishing<br/>
&gt; Norwalk, Fairfield County, CT<br/>
&gt; Placed by: Swiper<br/>
&gt; Box webpage located at:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Clues:<br/>
&gt;  Swiper is up to something fishy at the Maritime Aquarium!  This is a nice<br/>
easy box and you should only have to fish around for a few minutes, so be<br/>
sure and bring your little guppies!  Check the web site for hours of<br/>
operation and admission prices (www.maritimeaquarium.org). They have the<br/>
only IMAX theater in Connecticut and lots of cool hands-on things to do so<br/>
check it out before you go.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -Once you are inside, find the seals.<br/>
&gt; -While you keep the seals on the left, go catch some RAYS.<br/>
&gt; -Keeping the seals to your left, go through the door that leads to the<br/>
outside.<br/>
&gt; -Follow the outside path to the large boat on the left.<br/>
&gt; -Under the deck, several barrels lie.<br/>
&gt; -Can you find it, the box is sly.<br/>
&gt; -No, seriously, it is in the back middle barrel.<br/>
&gt; -Be stealthy like a shark, this area can be high traffic at certain times.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The whole hunt should take less than ten minutes but plan to spend some<br/>
time there to look around.<br/>
