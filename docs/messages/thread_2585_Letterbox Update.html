<br/>
 A couple weekends ago I set out to collect two of the three stamps <br/>
in the Live and Breathe series. I found them easily enough (I've <br/>
never had any trouble following Drewclans cluesheets)But I also found <br/>
that the Gladware boxes they were hidden in are pretty much falling <br/>
apart. I pretty much decided at the time to include in my pack one or <br/>
two of the heavier duty Rubbermaid (or equivalent) boxes as part of <br/>
my letterbox repair kit. I'm finding that many of the older Gladware <br/>
boxes are split on the cover, and just become worse with each opening <br/>
and closing. The Rubbermaid boxes are a little more expensive, but <br/>
still affordable for most of us. I guess what I'm trying to get <br/>
across is that it would be nice for us to carry a letterbox repair <br/>
kit when we go out, to help keep some of the earlier placed boxes in <br/>
good health. It's the least we can do to help out all of those who <br/>
have taken the time to place these boxes for our enjoyment. I hope <br/>
you all will join me.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have wondered about what to do about letterboxes in need of repair.  I<br/>
always carry the following with me:<br/>
	Spare baggies to replace damaged or missing ones<br/>
	Spare pens to replace damaged or missing ones<br/>
	Extra copies of the "about letterboxing" sheet<br/>
	A towel to dry and clean boxes<br/>
<br/>
However I have wondered what the planter might think if I removed a box for<br/>
repair.  If I removed one to repair it here are some questions I have:<br/>
	If the stamp pad is missing how exact a match to the original color is<br/>
important?  If the log is so soaked (as was the case with one I found) that<br/>
I can not determine the original color what do I do?<br/>
	If the log is too soaked to return in the repaired box should I replace it?<br/>
How do I get the soaked one back to the planter?<br/>
<br/>
I would not be comfortable removing a box someone else planted, even with<br/>
the good intention of repairing it, unless I knew the planter was<br/>
comfortable with my doing it.<br/>
<br/>
I would be happy to assist in cases where I knew the planter would<br/>
appreciate it and where I could return the box in reasonable time however I<br/>
think I would want to post a message on the list immediately that I had<br/>
removed the box.  Further more I would want to leave something in the hiding<br/>
place for others to let them know I had the box and they had found the spot.<br/>
<br/>

I personally do not think letterboxes should be removed for<br/>
repair at all.  I'd rather find a damaged letterbox than <br/>
none at all -- for me, its about the clues and that link with <br/>
the hider and the verification you are at the right spot.<br/>
Carrying a repair kit, OTOH, seems like a good solution.<br/>
<br/>
In the old days, it was ok to do this, I think.  Now, there<br/>
are enough people in the woods, and plenty of antecdotes <br/>
about meeting other letterboxers on the trail, that I don't<br/>
think it is ok.  It is no longer a remote possibility that<br/>
someone is 15 minutes behind you.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there are other reasons, which have to do with certain<br/>
puzzles.<br/>

Generally I agree with Randy.  It is good to bring all the pieces to <br/>
repair a box but sometimes the weather or your schedule doesn't <br/>
permit you to take the time right there to make the repairs.  I think <br/>
that you should use discretion and either contact the owner or only <br/>
take the box if you can quickly return it to its hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
Last winter, however, we found the Drew Clan's 1st Tribal Nation (CT) <br/>
box broken with the log book frozen in a block of ice.  I knew that <br/>
Eric Eurto had planned to get a group together the following weekend <br/>
to find the boxes and felt that the log book was beyond repair.  I <br/>
took the box home, replaced the log book, stamp pad and box and made <br/>
sure that it was back by the following weekend.  I dried out the old <br/>
logbook (which had lots of visitors' stamps!) and sent it to Jay <br/>
Drew.  Hiking in the winter with four little kids (not all mine) I <br/>
didn't want to take the time to make all the repairs necessary (nor <br/>
did I have all the parts) but wanted to make sure that Eric and <br/>
company would have something useful the following weekend.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Randy....  I have mixed feelings about this subject. Back in December <br/>
I came across a "Mad Piper" box that had been completely ravaged. I <br/>
found two chewed ziplock bags, the wet frozen log, the container full <br/>
of ise,  but no stamp. Best I can figure was a Raccoon carried off <br/>
the stamp. I retreived everything, put an alert on the clues and <br/>
posted two notes to the list to the Mad Piper. I never got a <br/>
response. So I took it upon myself to duplicate the stamp, rebuild <br/>
the log with the original dried pages and put everything back in <br/>
place. It was just two nice a spot to be abandoned.....  <br/>
