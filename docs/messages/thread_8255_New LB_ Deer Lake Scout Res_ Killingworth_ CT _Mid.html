Deer Lake Scout Reservation<br/>
Paper Mill Road<br/>
Killingworth, CT   Middlesex County.<br/>
<br/>
Three Letterboxes Placed by Magic Mike and T1<br/>
Date Placed: September 21, 2002<br/>
Difficulty: Moderate.  About a 2 mile walk on blazed trails.<br/>
<br/>
Deer Lake Scout Reservation is located on 253 acres in Killingworth, CT.  <br/>
Originally purchased by Central Connecticut Council in the 1960s, through <br/>
Council mergers, it is now part of the Connecticut Yankee Council of the Boy <br/>
Scouts of America.<br/>
<br/>
To get to the reservation:  Deer Lake Scout Reservation is located near <br/>
Route 80 in Killingworth, CT.  If you are coming from New Haven on Route 80, <br/>
go through the second traffic circle.  As you pass the Killingworth Town <br/>
Line, you will come to Chestnut Hill Road.  There is a big sign saying Deer <br/>
Lake Boy Scout Reservation.  Follow Chestnut Hill Road until you come to <br/>
River Road which is located on your left. It is a sharp turn, so dont miss <br/>
it.  Follow River Road to the stop sign.  You will see a small sign for Deer <br/>
Lake pointing to the left.  This is Paper Mill Road.  Follow that road to <br/>
the end and you will pull into Deer Lake.<br/>
<br/>
Check in at the ranger station, advise him that youd like to hike the <br/>
trails and ask for a trail map.  If there are none, or hes not there (Hes <br/>
very busy keeping the place ship shape.), there is a map posted on the <br/>
bulletin board in the main parking area.  Ill try to make the directions as <br/>
succinct as possible.<br/>
<br/>
There are currently three letterboxes located at Deer Lake.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Wheelers Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed in honor of Wallingford, CTs first Scoutmaster, Bill Wheeler.  It is <br/>
located at the Training Pavilion/Camping Area named after him.<br/>
