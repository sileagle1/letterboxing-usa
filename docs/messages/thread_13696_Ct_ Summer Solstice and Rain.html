                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all interested in tommorows summer solstice. The forecast is <br/>
horrible. The rain this year in relentless. Many events will be <br/>
cancelled tommorow. But I know letterboxers - if there is a stamp <br/>
they will be out there. So.... I will be there 10:15 -12 at the <br/>
picnic grove in my Blue Astro van ( chevy) reading the new harry <br/>
potter to the Cowboy and if folks want to come by for the event stamp <br/>
fine we will be happy to oblige. The lake is  in a flood stage and <br/>
parts of the circuit of the Kettle Hole series are under water. I <br/>
want to get to the dam itself and see how high the water is getting I <br/>
once saw it within inches of the top! Depending on the coperation of <br/>
the weather I may have a couple of other "quick boxes" .  We have a <br/>
planning meeting coming and may do a  fall event to make up for this. <br/>
( Will it still be raining?) I don't think it is worth coming a long <br/>
way for the abbreviated  event so the same event stamp can be made <br/>
available later in the season if folks want to meet there and picnic <br/>
we can pick a date.   Leader of the Pack<br/>
