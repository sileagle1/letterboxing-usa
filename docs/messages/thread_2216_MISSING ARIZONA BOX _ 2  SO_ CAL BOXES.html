<br/>
There are 2 new So. Cal. boxes at CSULB, (Cal. State University, Long Beach) <br/>
in Los Angeles County, that were planted on 4/17/01.  We highly recommend visits to these boxes during the weekend and on holidays when students are not about. Please notify us if the boxes are missing. Things to see in the area are the Japanese Garden near the dorms, the Pyramid on Atherton and the old Rancho at Bixby Hill on Palo Verde Ave., then head to Belmont Shore for shopping and eats.<br/>
Have fun, Don &amp; Gwen<br/>
