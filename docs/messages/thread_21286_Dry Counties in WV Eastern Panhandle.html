There are two listed in LP's county of residence <br/>
And one of those is retired. I've been to the other one. <br/>
<br/>
As for the county I'm moving to, there's one. And I already have it.<br/>
<br/>
It's a dry county for sure.<br/>
<br/>
LP you've been there for years.  Where are all of yours?<br/>

Dearest Ivy,<br/>
<br/>
As her Ladyship stated, other things draw ones attention. Uneasy lies<br/>
the head that wears the crown. The demands of Noblesse Oblige leave<br/>
little time for frivolity. Her Ladyship has indeed planted outside our<br/>
county of residence far more than within, but her Ladyship finds that<br/>
her box is rarely visited in the county whereas in the city her box<br/>
gets much much more attention. Perhaps now that you are moving to the<br/>
country your constant urging and coaxing will help enlarge her<br/>
Ladyship's P-ness. With you livign so near her Ladyship shall have to<br/>
strap on the old tool and get to work.<br/>
<br/>
With dread,<br/>
LP<br/>
<br/>

"Lady" Prisspott,<br/>
<br/>
There's no doubt in my mind that your box is highly trafficked.<br/>
<br/>
I am merely suggesting that you stretch your legs a bit so that <br/>
others may also enjoy your talents.<br/>
<br/>
I'll whip out my tool and press it in the rubber and perhaps together <br/>
we can make our dry counties wet.<br/>

This thread is strangely alluring and it makes me wonder how someone <br/>
in such a dry environment can have a large f and p-ness.<br/>
