<br/>
Thank you for all of  the kind words that have been<br/>
said about us about the gathering. It is nice to hear<br/>
all these great words but all of the credit should go<br/>
to MommaFox, Bald Eagle, and Teach &amp; Preach.<br/>
Unfortunately The Maplines had all kinds of real life<br/>
things happen and they didn't get to help as much as<br/>
they would have liked to. We have had our first<br/>
grandson born a month early and in Hartford Hospital.<br/>
He is home now and growing like a weed . Thank you to<br/>
all for  your thoughts and prayers. The other major<br/>
mess up in our lives is that we have a new house and<br/>
we were trying to finish painting and move into it<br/>
while our grandson was being born. This all happened<br/>
right at the wrong time.We lost our stamps that I<br/>
craved in a box somewhere. (I'm still looking ) So<br/>
thank you and take care and go letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>

We started Letterboxing on 8/29/2003 and fell in love with it. Now we are hooked.<br/>
