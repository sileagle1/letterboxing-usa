 I DON'T KNOW . I have found letterboxes in Dept.of Environment Conservation lands . <br/>
in New York State.  Since you haven't seen anything that says no,  I would just plant <br/>
the letterbox. <br/>

I would like to place two different letterboxes in two different New Jersey Wildlife Management areas.  I have checked the letterboxing site and there is nothing on NJ.  I checked the NJ DEP web site and there is nothing about letterboxing.  There are classes offered in different NJ Wildlife Management ares for geocaching, mostly in North Jersey.  I feel that contacting the NJ Division of Wildlife Management might be opening an unnecessary can of worms.  These areas are open to fishing, biking, bird watching and even some hunting.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">To quote another boxer it is easier to ask forgiveness than permission. If your box is well hidden a park ranger won't find it especialy if you don't use the name of the park in your clues. You can spell it backwards for example.<br/>
And yes contacting any authority will open a can of worms. I think it is better we stay under the radar. I do have a few boxes in Jersey with no problems.<br/>
