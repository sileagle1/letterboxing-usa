                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow! I received such a great response to this in just one day! I already<br/>
have about 28 people signed up (and will put out a list very soon!). If you<br/>
would like to still sign up for this, please send me your address off list.<br/>
I will keep the list open until Monday (to try to catch some of those that<br/>
may only check on weekends!).<br/>
<br/>
BTW...I was a Brownie, Girl scout, Cadet as a girl.  I was my son's Tiger<br/>
Cub Leader, Wolf Leader and then Cubmaster for his Pack as well as Assistant<br/>
Leader for his Bear and Webelos Dens. This is my last year as Cubmaster.<br/>
It's been a fun ride! The coolest thing was going through my mom's things<br/>
after she passed away and finding her "official" Den Mother card for Pack<br/>
26...the same Pack I'm Cubmaster for now! I now wear her Den Mother pin with<br/>
pride!<br/>
