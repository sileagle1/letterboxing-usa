Cool!
<br/>I'm on my way to Vancouver next month, and I will try to hunt that
box (in addition to perhaps leaving one of my own).

I was looking at some of the archives and it seems that there is a <br/>
letterbox that was planted in Vancouver, BC in September by Lisa <br/>
Manne, but when you click on the map for Canadian Clues it only shows <br/>
the ones for Quebec and Nova Scotia.  British Columbia should be <br/>
"blued", as well and these clues, included, I think.  Maybe some of <br/>

Please do plant a letterbox or two, while you're hunting for the other one<br/>
up in Vancouver.  That would be lovely and it would give me just one more<br/>
excuse to visit the beautiful paradise of British Columbia!<br/>
