       Please restore the following clue for the back-in-place Henlopen Tower Letterbox on Cape Henlopen, Delaware.  We hope it stays put for a while now!<br/>

<b>Cape Henlopen Tower Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
</b>Originally placed August 7, 2002, by Daphne's Family and Lizzy<br/>
Restored March, 2003<br/>
Location:  Cape Henlopen State Park, Delaware<br/>
<br/>
       Enter Cape Henlopen State Park and obtain a park map at the entrance. (You may have to pay a parking fee of $2.50 for in-state cars, $5.00 for out-of-state cars.)  Follow the map to the Observation Tower.  Climb to the top of the tower and, after enjoying the view, look south along the coast toward twin towers in the direction of Rehoboth Beach.  Facing that direction, look down to your left and locate the paved bike path that appears to lead in that same direction.  Follow that path.  In a short while, you will come to old railroad tracks embedded in the path.  From these tracks, count 25 (adult) steps and stop.  Directly to your left, you will see a large, gnarly pine tree, the Guardian of the Letterbox. (If you come to a fork in the path, you have missed the tracks.)  Search no higher than your head for the treasure it guards.</body></html>

                    <html><body><p>Hello Daphne's family and Lizzy,
</p><p>Just got back from a <u>beautiful</u> weekend visit to Lewes, and made a stop at Cape Henlopen Park.  The Henlopen Tower box was there and dry.  I really wanted to get this one before it disappeared again.  I hope it does not.  We also found the Cape Henlopen Devil box.  This one had my husband chuckling at the post card included in the box.  A good idea.  These two boxes are all we had time for, but what really made this fun, was that this was our first time to stamp in as  family-TrekerJo, Bobcat and Mouse.  We wanted to get back for the one near the point, but that will have to wait until we get back there in May.  Then, I hope to get some boxes south of that area too. Time will tell as that is a busy weekend too.  So many boxes, so little time.
</p><p>Thanks for replacing the box at the Tower.  Happy trails-TrekerJo
