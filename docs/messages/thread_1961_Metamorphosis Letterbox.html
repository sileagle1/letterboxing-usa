daughter comes home from school with every week.  Inspired by her study of<br/>
insects and one of her recent spelling lists (including chrysalis and<br/>
metamorphosis) I decided to do this series of boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
We planted the "Metamorphosis" series of 3 letterboxes in Hoffman Evergreen<br/>
Preserve in Stonington, CT on Sunday.  As my husband and I met up with Wanda<br/>
and Pete later to do more letterboxing we were discussing the safety of the<br/>
location that we had chosen for "Chrysalis."  Wanda and Pete graciously offered<br/>
to return to the preserve on Monday and relocate it if necessary.  Not only did<br/>
they relocate "Chrysalis" but also hid "Larva" in a less conspicuous spot for<br/>
us.  A special thanks to them because, as you will see if you decide to pursue<br/>
these boxes, I consider these stamps to be irreplaceable.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy your butterfly hunt!<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Trish<br/>
