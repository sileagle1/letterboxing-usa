Did Haley's Hex today -  what a great spot!  How do<br/>
you manage to find these places?  I sat a while and<br/>
imagined the grotto was a place for Druid ceremonies<br/>
or Celtic dances. I could picture a big bonfire and a<br/>
stone circle and hooded figures dancing to some<br/>
ancient song.  Awesome! The only drawback was that I<br/>
didn't bring my repelling gear to get down off the<br/>
cliff (short people got no reason.....!!  LOL)  Thanks<br/>
again for another terrific box!<br/>

to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I<br/>
HAD NOT LIVED AT ALL!"<br/>
