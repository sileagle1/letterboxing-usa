BIG SLICK AND THE ACE OF SPADES micro-box<br/>
 THE GAMBLER SERIES LETTERBOXES<br/>
<br/>
Once again Dalliance dropped murky hints, leaving him to sort it out<br/>
alone. Who did she think she was, Agatha danged Christie?  She simply<br/>
could not tell him anything straight out, always had to make it sound<br/>
mysterious.  This time, on a humid August afternoon thick with bugs,<br/>
high above the two lakes, he was tracking down another Ace.<br/>
<br/>
Passing the frisbee golf park before turning into the parking lot, he<br/>
thought it's kinda cool the way dogs carried those things in their<br/>
mouths with their lips spread wide over the flat saucers.  Getting a<br/>
flash of someone darting after a fluorescent pink orb, how hot can<br/>
that guy be?  There was no way you'd get me to run after one, man<br/>
today was a roaster.<br/>
<br/>
Entering the woods heading south west on the orange trail, Big Slick<br/>
turned for a last look at the gravel lot and his old truck.  George<br/>
West said it was a rust bucket but he liked to think of it as a winter<br/>
rat and a handsome one at that, he thought with a snort.  The path<br/>
went up steeply and he was grateful for the shade.  Breathing hard<br/>
when he reached the top, he had to stop and think what Dalliance said<br/>
about the tricky paths.  <br/>
<br/>
"Don't take the little trail that hairpins back, go to the small road<br/>
where two signs for water are: one for drinking, one not.  Let these<br/>
be behind you and follow the orange."  She said.<br/>
<br/>
Big Slick travelled down this primitive road.  At first he was annoyed<br/>
because he could have just driven here, but then noticed the sign for<br/>
no motor vehicles.  Soon he came to marker 3 and not far past this, a<br/>
trail split off to the right and opened into a small clearing where<br/>
briefly he was blinded by the brilliant ochre light before the path<br/>
dipped back into the woods to the left.  He made a mental note of this<br/>
and kept it in his mind that the trail re-entered the woods at 9:00.   <br/>
<br/>
Slick followed the orange blaze to his right and up the hill.  When he<br/>
emerged he was in a cabin colony.  He walked along and thought how he<br/>
might like to come here and stay for a weekend when the weather turned<br/>
cool.  Just past cabin #1  he saw a fence behind the cabin and a path<br/>
to the right of the cabin leading to the rim of a steep hill and a<br/>
sign "No Bikes".  Big Slick walked over to the trail, looked down and<br/>
thought I can just see some yee-yaw riding a bike along this edge and<br/>
slipping off and then someone trying to get him back up.  Yeeah tha'd<br/>
be fun. Quick way to the lake! he laughed.  He went back to the front<br/>
of the cabin to pick up the orange trail. <br/>
<br/>
"Let the orange blaze cross the road, for you will turn the other way<br/>
and enter the woods.  It is then you will see the four brothers, the<br/>
kings, you will see gathered together at the rim.  They stand close at<br/>
the base and in age dare to spread their crown."  Dalliance said.<br/>
<br/>
Nutcake strikes again  he thought to himself, shaking his head, then<br/>
he saw the trees, looked at them from different angles, noticed the<br/>
resemblance and almost giggled.  <br/>
<br/>
Not far off to the west on the trail was an old maple, lying like a<br/>
rotting corpse, belly up and ripe with termites.  Looking like a<br/>
headless stone age creature prostrate on the ground.  Man, this creeps<br/>
me out no end he thought and he was glad it was still daylight.  His<br/>
pace quickened and not long after he saw a fork in the path, the one<br/>
to the left looked too dangerous so he stayed with the right.  <br/>
<br/>
The area was so beautiful here, and trees so varied, and some so<br/>
strange.  One off to the left was big and gnarly and one up ahead<br/>
looked like it was sticking it's hip out and flirting with him!  Now<br/>
that's something Dalliance would choose he thought.  <br/>
<br/>
"A little chewed up by critters but I got-chya!"  he said startling a<br/>
chipmunk as he pulled his prize from under a stone. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take extra care to re-hide and cover any gaps with a sprinkling of<br/>
leaves.  <br/>
<br/>
You may need to do a visual check from different angles to be sure<br/>
it's well hidden.  <br/>

I have 2 more stories to finish writing up in the Gambler series (4<br/>

there are now 7 boxes that I know of. :-))<br/>
