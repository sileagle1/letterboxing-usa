Captain's Walk<br/>
<br/>
<i>(Replaced in a new spot, December 2001)<br/>

(Replaced again, December, 2002)</i><br/>
<br/>
An easy three mile walk through the historic district of Mystic Connecticut, passing the homes of many 19th Century sea captains.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: from I-95 in Mystic, CT, take exit 89 (Allyn Street). Turn south toward Mystic and take the first left onto Sandy Hollow Rd. Follow the boat launch signs to turn left on High St, right on Bindloss Ave, and then left on River Rd. Follow River Rd northward to pass under the I-95 bridges and park in the jogger's and stroller's area along the river.<br/>
<br/>
Taking foot, backtrack southwards downstream on River Road with the water on your left for about  mile to the historic district. Turn left on Starr St, which will become Pearl St for a block, and then turn left onto Eldridge St. In a short way, turn left on Gravel St and follow it almost to the end. Look for a small public park/parking area on the left, just opposite the Christian Science Reading Room. There are two large railroad-tie planters there on the southwest side with zen-shapely cedars. Try the eastern planter closest to the water and look in the southwest side just under the cedar for the Captain's Walk Letterbox. There are wonderful shore side benches placed just for your stamping-in ritual.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the return voyage: you could just retrace your steps, but the following route is the one recommended by the Mystic Historical Society. Carefully cross busy West Main St in the crosswalk and turn left (east), enjoying the shops and boutiques. Just as you step onto the drawbridge, turn right onto the decked wharf along the river. Follow the wharf downstream and pass through the Steamboat Wharf gate (public coastal access is protected by law). Follow the wharf a short way further to turn right toward a parking lot. Now head west, left when facing away from the water towards the parking lot, passing behind condos and back to the river. Walk between the river to your left and the Mystic Art Association to the right, and then turn right with the path. In the parking lot, with ledge straight ahead, turn right past the front door of the Art Association and then jog left out onto the main street at the little gatehouse. (Our eldest enjoys her first job waiting tables across the street at the Voodoo Grill: stop in for their white chili if you're hungry!) Turn right, northeast, here and walk a block down to the intersection with Rte 1. Go left, west, at the crosswalk, and then right to cross over to the north side of the road by Mystic Pizza - yes, <i>that</i> Mystic Pizza.<br/>
<br/>
Turn left and walk westerly uphill towards the imposing Union Baptist Church. Turn right just before it onto High St and walk several scenic northbound blocks. Turn right on Clift St, then left on Clift Lane, then right on Starr St and finally left onto River Rd, back to the start.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
