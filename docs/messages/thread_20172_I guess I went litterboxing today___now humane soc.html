And too Ruth, I don't mean to pick on you but I just<br/>
cringe when I hear you say "pound".  <br/>
<br/>
I work at a Humane Society and we have a contract with<br/>
the city to do Animal Control as well.  So many people<br/>
call us the pound or doggie jail.  We are neither.  <br/>
<br/>
We are a shelter for animals in need. <br/>
<br/>
I think that's great though that you have a mandatory<br/>
return policy.  We have one here as well.  : )<br/>
<br/>
One of the hazards of working here is that you <br/>
1)adopt lots of critters yourself<br/>
2)adopt lots of opinions <br/>
3)get pretty vocal about sharing both of them LOL. <br/>

No offence intended at all. I just have a hard hard time with "pounds"<br/>
Here in GA we have some no kill shelters and that is good, but the<br/>
city animal control does euthanize, and that is more what I was<br/>
referring to. It just breaks my heart to go in ans see all those cats<br/>
there, knowing if someone doesn't take them home the wont be there the<br/>
next time I go. One of the reasons I have 6 now. I am very happy so<br/>
see you guys have a good set up. Now if we can just educate the "good<br/>
ole boy network" here, we would be a few steps ahead.<br/>
