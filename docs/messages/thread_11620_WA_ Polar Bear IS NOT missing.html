Tacoma was missing, I was finally able to verify its status late <br/>
this afternoon.  I'm very happy to report that the Polar Bear is <br/>
still very much alive &amp; well!!!  Whew!!!  Since I had already carved <br/>
a replacement box before I went out there, now I have yet another <br/>
duplicate LB on my hands--I guess he'll be hanging out with the Sea <br/>
Plane for a while...  See you on the trail!<br/>

&gt; I won't be able to personally verify that it is, indeed, missing <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; several weeks--I just want to let those folks out there who might <br/>
