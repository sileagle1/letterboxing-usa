Without the Fool, life would be boring.<br/>
<br/>
(Below is from LearnTarot.org.)<br/>
<br/>
The Fool lies at the beginning of the major arcana, but also somewhat <br/>
apart from the other cards. In medieval courts, the court jester was <br/>
someone who was not expected to follow the same rules as others. He <br/>
could observe and then poke fun. This makes the Fool unpredictable <br/>
and full of surprises. He reminds us of the unlimited potential and <br/>
spontaneity inherent in every moment. There is a sense with this card <br/>
that anything goes - nothing is certain or regular. The Fool adds the <br/>
new and unfamiliar to a situation. <br/>
<br/>
The Fool also represents the complete faith that life is good and <br/>
worthy of trust. Some might call the Fool too innocent, but his <br/>
innocence sustains him and brings him joy. In readings, the Fool can <br/>
signal a new beginning or change of direction - one that will guide <br/>
you onto a path of adventure, wonder and personal growth. He also <br/>
reminds you to keep your faith and trust your natural responses. If <br/>
you are facing a decision or moment of doubt, the Fool tells you to <br/>
believe in yourself and follow your heart no matter how crazy or <br/>
foolish your impulses may seem. <br/>
