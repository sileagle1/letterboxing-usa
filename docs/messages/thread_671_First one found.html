Do you mean that E.M.S. is holding a Letterboxing clinic?!?!?!?!  Or do you<br/>
mean a hiking/outdoors-type clinic?<br/>

&gt;We went out Sunday, 9/26/99, and found our first letterbox. It was an<br/>
&gt;enjoyable fall day in Eastern CT. The box we found was on top of Mount<br/>
&gt;Misery in the Pachaug State Forest in  Voluntown, CT. It was a moderate<br/>
&gt;hike with a fantastic view ...<br/>
<br/>
We found this box this July. I wouldn't call that a moderate hike :-) I just<br/>
about expired climbing that "hill"! It was a great reward though.<br/>
 Let me know if you find the Narragansett Whiterock. It was the only box we<br/>
searched for that we didn't find.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, Marty, he means that the local EMS franchise has been the driving<br/>
force behind letterboxing in this area. Instead of their usual kayaking<br/>
or hiking clinic, they're doing a letterboxing thing Thursday evening.<br/>
Don't know what's on the agenda, and seriously wish there were more<br/>
interested people around to participate, but that sure is one way to<br/>
get the word out! There have been two new people responding on the list<br/>
this week from the southern CT area and I presume it is because of the<br/>
Waterford EMS.<br/>
<br/>
They have a stamp-in poster, where maybe 25 letterboxing people have<br/>
left their personal stamp images, and a nice convienient binder with<br/>
envelopes of the 30 or so clue sheets for this area all made up for<br/>
people to take. They also have a little display right at the registers<br/>
of the "gear" needed to put a box together. That's how I found out<br/>
about this thing myself.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty cool! (and of course I have no commericial affiliation with EMS<br/>
and will reap no financial rewards from talking them up on this<br/>
forum......)<br/>
