Easy, great for families.  But watch for cars. <br/>
This is a film canister microbox.  You must bring your own pen and <br/>
stamp pad.   <br/>

This would be the most ordinary of dingy strip malls, were it not for <br/>
its owner, an art patron named David Bermant.  Instead, thanks to <br/>
Bermant's passion for public art, the mall has more than twenty <br/>
pieces of sculpture towering over the parking lots and lining the <br/>
sidewalk in front of the stores.   Many of them movesome almost <br/>
imperceptibly, some with the push of a button, others with every <br/>
breeze.  For a complete list of the art, and the controversies that <br/>
have sometimes surrounded it, see <br/>
http://www.enteract.com/~jdeubel/plaza/<br/>
Undoubtedly, the best-known piece of art in the Cermak Plaza, thanks <br/>
both to its size and its cameo role in the movie "Wayne's World," is <br/>
an 80 foot tall spike that appears to have been pushed through a <br/>
stack of  eight cars in various stages of disintegration.    The <br/>
sculpture is officially named "Spindle" but at our house we've always <br/>
just called it "Cars-on-a-stick."  This letterbox is placed in honor <br/>
of this quirky piece of public art and in the hopes that you'll stop <br/>
awhile and appreciate this too often neglected collection.  <br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
    The Cermak Plaza is located at the southeast corner of the <br/>
intersection of Harlem Avenue and Cermak Road in Berwyn, Illinois, <br/>
about eight miles from downtown Chicago.  Both the Eisenhower <br/>
expressway (I-290) and the Stevenson Expressway (I-55) have Harlem <br/>
Avenue exits (the mall is about two miles south of the Eisenhower and <br/>
about four miles north of the Stevenson). The mall can also be <br/>
reached by public transportation.     <br/>
Once you've located the mall, start your search at the base of the <br/>
Cars-on-a-stick.  Note and remember the artist's nameyou'll need it <br/>
later.  Now look toward the horizon, facing the same direction as the <br/>
spindled car with the license plate KPA 807. As you scan the horizon <br/>
to your left you'll see a water tower, and then just below and to the <br/>
left of the water tower, you'll see a moving sculpture that just <br/>
sticks above a small square building.  That sculpture is called "Bee <br/>
Tree" by artist George Rhoads.<br/>
          You're going to go over by Bee Tree, and you can make a bee <br/>
line to it.  Starting from in front of Bee Tree, go around the square <br/>
building until you find another sculpture by the same artist who did <br/>
the cars-on-a-stick.  As you read the sign, notice that you are in an <br/>
extremely public spot.  Think of how very foolish it would be to put <br/>
a letterbox in the rear wheel well of that sculpture.  Someone would <br/>
surely take it.  So anticipate that the replacement box would be in a <br/>
much less public place.  Walk east along the sidewalk in front of the <br/>
mall, admiring all the sculptures on your way.  Continue past a store <br/>
where you can put all your eggs in one basket and then past one where <br/>
you can add a salami.  Pass a bench and a bike rack.  Oops, you're <br/>
off the end of the sidewalk!  Head back toward the cars-on-a-stick, <br/>
circling the outside of a small clump of bushes.  There's a rock at <br/>
the northeastern corner of the clump that would be a good place to <br/>
stop and tie your shoe.  Facing the salami place as bend over to tie <br/>
your shoe, reach into the bushes about 8" above the ground and find <br/>
the film-canister microbox.  With luck, it will be held to one of the <br/>
branches with a loop of Velcro.  BE VERY DISCREET FINDING AND <br/>
REPLACING THE BOX!!  <br/>
