                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had similar questions about event stamps.  I have never<br/>
been to an event, but always wondered what the E respresents<br/>
for people that have been to them.  Is it number of events<br/>
attended or number of event stamps obtained?<br/>
Also, how does the person that carved the event stamp<br/>
count it?  Is it a P?  What do you do with it after the<br/>
event?  Send it off as a HH or retire it?<br/>
<br/>
As far as HH at events, I would count them as F since<br/>
they were brought to the event for you to find, just<br/>
not in a letterbox.  Basically if you stamp it in your<br/>
book it should count.<br/>

&gt; around on the tables at these events as "F" or not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know there are no hard and fast rules but I was just wondering <br/>
&gt; what the general consensus is on this. After all, no real effort is <br/>
&gt; expended in searching out these stamps. The numbers really mean <br/>
&gt; nothing compared with the simple joy of getting outdoors and <br/>
&gt; exercising the old grey matter but it'd be nice just to know how <br/>
&gt; others are arriving at their counts.<br/>

&gt; Thoughts?<br/>

In terms of the event stamp, I carved one for the Maine Event.  After the <br/>
event was over I turned the stamp into a HH and sent it on it's merry way!<br/>
<br/>
If there are special boxes/stamps that were carved/placed just for the day <br/>
one might want to replace them in a more fixed location before distributing <br/>
the clue/posting. I counted the Maine Event as "P" and didn't count the HH as <br/>
anything as it was the same stamp recycled into a HH.<br/>

I agree with Silver Eagle on this one. I think that<br/>
the way we count stamps should be kept as simple as<br/>
possible. If I exchange stamps with another boxer, or<br/>
another boxer gives me an impression of their personal<br/>
stamp, than it's an X. If it goes in the logbook, it's<br/>
an F. Doesn't matter if we found it in the woods or in<br/>
the mailbox. We don't count HH seperately. Don't<br/>
really understand why folks do. An F is an F, in our<br/>
opinion. If we put a stamp out for boxers to find,<br/>
either in a tuperware or a new HH or whatever, it's a<br/>
P. We don't have an events under our belt yet, but<br/>
once we do, that's an E. We do count virtual boxes<br/>
seperately, as a V, because they are "found", but no<br/>
impression is in our book. We also are tracking our<br/>
adopted boxes seperately, as an A. We didn't plant<br/>
them, but we're keeping an eye on them.<br/>
<br/>
Our hobby is a simple one. Why make it overly<br/>
complicated?<br/>
