<br/>
    I was the first one to stamp into these new letterboxes near<br/>
Leominister, MA today, and I want to say that they are "way cool"!<br/>
<br/>
    I took some hiking friends out today with the clue sheet, and we had fun<br/>
searching for these boxes with their nice stamps!<br/>
<br/>
    I am quite new to letterboxing, although I did learn about them when I<br/>
lived in England, and found the Ripon Tor   Rifle Range letterbox near<br/>
Dartmoor many years ago.<br/>
<br/>
    Hope to carve my own unique stamp and also to place some boxes near my<br/>
home in Concord, MA.<br/>
<br/>
    I take people out walking and hiking and we found two placed by the<br/>
drewclan on the M and M trail - Mt. Norwottock and Rattlesnake Knob last<br/>
week!<br/>
<br/>
    Sorry that I didn't go to the RI gathering!<br/>
<br/>
    Cheers!<br/>
