    Friday, Princess Turtle and I went to Scotts Cove, in Howard Co.,MD, to <br/>
find aweehedgehogs boxes. Yes, back to the scene of my near mud drowning. <br/>
Nice hike, a little sketchy on the clues but found all three. Thanks to all <br/>
the snow melt the reservoir was full and the area of my near demise was all <br/>
ice and there were people in canoes gliding all around the edges. A little <br/>
hint for finding the #2 box, look for the black lace panties hanging at eye <br/>
level. Someone had a good time!<br/>
<br/>
    Sat. PT and I headed to My Dear Watkins, Prince Georges Co.,MD, planted <br/>
by Celtic Pride. Very challenging, and we found all 5. Number 3 took us 45 <br/>
min. but persistence paid off. You said it might be a little difficult and <br/>
it was! Two hours to go 1 mile. Definitely at turtle speed.<br/>
    Good lord you guys live far away. Alli and I took a wrong turn somewhere <br/>
or missed a route marker and ended up in the district where you just don't <br/>
want to be. PT said forget this let's go home. I said nope and took a left <br/>
turn, in a no left turn intersection and, in front of a cop, to turn us back <br/>
around. Saw the BW Pkwy and headed North, then got on the Capital Bltwy and <br/>
found route 214. I could not believe how far off track we were.<br/>
     We were so happy to survive the drive and manage to nab all 5 boxes <br/>
that we decided we needed a big reward. We spotted a Wendy's and both yelled <br/>
out FROSTY'S!!! After we MMMMMMM'd our way through our reward and I reviewed <br/>
my map skills, we were "good to go and ready to launch" (quote borrowed from <br/>
G. Gordon Liddy)<br/>
    Next weekend I think we'll look for the ones closer to home. Thanks <br/>
tempusfugit for planting them practically in our back yard! Not really but <br/>
it's the closest any one has done in a long time.<br/>
    The End<br/>
