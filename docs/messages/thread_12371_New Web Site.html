not refer to it.  There are also a few glitchs in the new site (e.g., you<br/>
can't get past the Waiver page to edit a box right now) but I am sure they<br/>
will be worked out soon.<br/>
<br/>
It is a great new way to post boxes and, when up and running full time, may<br/>
obviate the need to read so many e-mails to get to new sites in a particular<br/>
area.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was wondering why people are placing their clues on this website<br/>
&gt; &gt; but not on the mainwebsite for letterboxing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This talk list is how the clues get to the main web site...  well, at<br/>
&gt; least the "old" main web site.  That site<br/>
&gt; (http://www.letterboxing.org) did not have functionality for people<br/>
&gt; to enter their own clues and could only be updated by web masters<br/>
&gt; making changes to the web pages.  So when people placed a new<br/>
&gt; letterbox, they used this talk list as a way to announce that and the<br/>
&gt; web masters picked it up from there and added it to the "main site."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The "new" main site (which is temporarily found at<br/>
&gt; http://letterboxing.wesgarrison.us/) has the functionality for people<br/>
&gt; to just add their own clues, rather than having to have the web<br/>
&gt; masters do all of the work.  It also has the ability to "announce"<br/>
&gt; the box to a special yahoo groups list that anyone can join, and<br/>
&gt; therefore get notification of new boxes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For a while, the two "main sites" are co-existing to allow people<br/>
&gt; time to get their clues added to the new site and still leaving them<br/>
&gt; available on the old site so people can find them to go out<br/>
&gt; letterboxing.  After the transition is completed and we are using the<br/>
&gt; new site exclusively, there will not be a need to post new clues to<br/>
&gt; this list any longer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope that makes sense.<br/>
