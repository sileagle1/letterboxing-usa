disappeared, because we got emails from some people right away last <br/>
year when they found it, then got an email from someone who couldn't <br/>
find it, and then nothing at all.  So, I carved a new, different <br/>
stamp and made a new box, all ready to go out there and replace it.  <br/>
We were very pleasantly surprised to find the Bassackwards Letterbox <br/>
still there and in great shape!  Yay!  It was so cool to look through <br/>
the book and see all the stamps that had found their way there.<br/>
<br/>
Since we had another box with us, and it had a different stamp in it, <br/>
we decided to hide it as a continuation of Bassackwards the First.  <br/>
So, also at Cunningham Falls, there is now The Bassackwards Box II!<br/>
