an amazing and almost-unbelievable news bit about British city people <br/>
being asked not to visit the countryside because of hoof-and-mouth <br/>
disease. News person said there would actually be roadblocks!<br/>

<br/>
The news is grave and sad..<br/>
<br/>
The official Dartmoor National Park Authority website is <br/>
<br/>
http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/<br/>
<br/>
and it bears a broad heading stating :<br/>
<br/>
"All common land and other access land, and all footpaths and bridleways,<br/>
within the Dartmoor area have been closed to public access until further<br/>
notice for the protection of grazing animals"<br/>
<br/>
So it is true, I am sad to say that, "Dartmoor is closed" !<br/>
<br/>
You might find the Dartmoor National park site interesting.  It has some<br/>
nice pictures of Dartmoor ..and a few odd ones !<br/>
<br/>
On the "MOOR CARE" link page is the Dartmoor National Park leaflet about<br/>
Letterboxing as a PDF download file...<br/>
<br/>
Yes ! A "real life government leaflet" about our hobby  <gosh><br/>
<br/>
..It only took the British Government about 148 years to get one printed<br/>
... not bad for a government dept ! <lol><br/>
<br/>
It does have some UK letterboxing stamps on it and is quite quaint imho ! <br/>
<br/>
Also the TEN TORS site is cool..The description of this outdoor overnight<br/>
trek across the moor is interesting ..It is open to all and you get a very<br/>
very special badge as a participant... It also shows how dangerous our<br/>
tiny little moor can be ! <br/>
<br/>
But at the moment the red bordered, intersecting black crescents sign for<br/>
biohazard is the main feature of Dartmoor..and I for one will not put the<br/>
famous Dartmoor ponies or distinctive Red Devon cattle or the moorland<br/>
sheep at possible risk by crossing the quarantine markers !<br/>
<br/>
A commemorative stamp recording our exile will be placed on the moor when<br/>
we return I am certain !<br/>
<br/>
But for the next few weeks or so the LbNA members in the USA are keeping<br/>
the World Letterboxing spirit alive while we humble Brit boxers keep a<br/>
vigil over our beloved moors...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for that !<br/>
