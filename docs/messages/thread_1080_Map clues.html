I had been spoiled but such quick turnaround that I got a little anxious when there was a delay. Sometimes I forget other people have lives too. Sorry. <br/>
<br/>
I will not be able to put clues on my web pages until after Thanksgiving. But since there are so few in this area I think I might go ahead and send them to the talk list so they are available and then in a few months I will put them on my web sites. I have the sites divided by geography so you could anticipate the location but they won't be on the web for a while. I'll let you know when they are up. So far everything I have sent to the talk list are on my web site. But beginning today they won't be.<br/>

Happy hunting and thanks for the hand holding,<br/>

If you place anymore West Virginia or Virginia LBs while you are off<br/>
line..... I will be happy to still update the VA map. I will put your text<br/>
clue info on my web site and link the dot to it. It won't be fancy, just the<br/>
edited (i'll take the email headers off) text file from your clue email, but<br/>
at least we will have all the info on line. Then it is just an easy change<br/>
on the VA.htm page to link to you when you get back on line......<br/>
