Sleeping Giant State Park<br/>
The Table<br/>
<br/>
The story :<br/>
Will the table be Big enough?? That is what everyone wanted to know. <br/>
Butterfly tried to<br/>
assure them that it is huge. For this gathering of friends, a large <br/>
table was needed.<br/>
Bluebird coming from the East and carrying the Welcome Banner in her <br/>
beak, swooped<br/>
up the switchback on her way to visit Hezekial. A lovely blue feather <br/>
drifted down and<br/>
match the trail below. It slowly settled just below the switchback. ----<br/>
<br/>
The clue : Just before the climb up the switchback, stop at a blue <br/>
blazed three sister tree<br/>
with one sister passed on. Count 28 steps at 120 degrees to a three <br/>
sister oak tree.<br/>
Bluebirds feather letterbox can be found in its arms. Stamp in and cover <br/>
the box well.<br/>
<br/>
The story::<br/>
At the top of the knob Bluebird rested to chat with Hezekial in the <br/>
shade of a Cedar Tree.<br/>
Meanwhile ,Aili and Bruce just back from a trip to Camelot, were <br/>
planning to meet their<br/>
friend The Green Knight on the trail as they waited for Merlin to join <br/>
them from the<br/>
Grotto. They were all going to travel to the gather together. Chatting <br/>
and showing the<br/>
newest jewelry from Camelot, they began the climb up the yellow cross <br/>
over trail and<br/>
turned east onto the Orange trail, a favorite because their tower could <br/>
be seen from<br/>
several view points. The did not notice the porcupine tree snag a <br/>
necklace.-----.<br/>
<br/>
The Clue:<br/>
On the Orange trail after viewing the tower over your left shoulder <br/>
several times, enter a<br/>
small grove of Hemlock trees. In about 12 steps the trail bends right up <br/>
a small rocky<br/>
climb with a large dead pine tree on the left side of the trail. Like a <br/>
huge porcupine,<br/>
under the tree in a rocky cave is the Necklace Letterbox. Cover it well.<br/>
<br/>
The Story:<br/>
Getting to the Cascades early to fill bottles with cool water for the <br/>
gather. Lobsta Lady<br/>
shouldered her usual packed knapsack and began the climb up to meet the <br/>
others at the<br/>
crossroads . The plan was to all meet at the intersection , and it was a <br/>
long walk. Crossing<br/>
a wooden plank bridge over the Cascades awhile before reaching the <br/>
violet trail, she<br/>
stopped for a water break and hearing the laughter up ahead, left her <br/>
Jug of water behind<br/>
as she rushed to catch up.<br/>
<br/>
The Clue:<br/>
After crossing the wooden plank bridge over the cascades, count just <br/>
about 100 steps .<br/>
The cascades are on the right and a 3 sister oak grows just off trail on <br/>
the left before a<br/>
small laurel grove. It holds the Water Jug Letterbox. Make sure it is <br/>
well covered<br/>
<br/>
The Story:<br/>
The laughter was from the Drew Clan. they had arrived the day before to <br/>
spend the night<br/>
camping at their friend Neds cabin. Now as they prepared to break camp <br/>
and head out to<br/>
the gather, the box of quartz rocks was getting heavy. Jay wanted to <br/>
show off the new<br/>
collection of quartz he had recently been gifted and Merlin was an <br/>
expert on Quartz The<br/>
two would have their heads together all too soon. Just East of the <br/>
cabin, Tumble tumble,<br/>
out tumbled a piece of quartz and no one even heard it fall. -----<br/>
The Clue:<br/>
At the smooth rock on the Giants right leg,[ east of Neds Cabin for <br/>
those who have been<br/>
there !!] There at a small group of 3 pine trees. Atop of the bald rocks <br/>
is a pipe imbedded<br/>
in a rock. Stand next to the pipe and turn North , take 2 steps and <br/>
under a flat top rock is<br/>
the Quartz Rock Letterbox. Hide this one really well.<br/>
<br/>
The story:<br/>
Angel had been invited to join the group and she flew in from the west <br/>
to The Bears<br/>
hiding spot to gather some of his gift to share. As she always carries <br/>
angel Dust, she<br/>
sprinkled it on the tree tops along the way. Just before reaching the <br/>
Bear, she stopped at<br/>
the spring for a cool drink and left some angel dust for a thank you . <br/>
look -----<br/>
<br/>
The clue:<br/>
At the source of the spring on the White Trail where the Blue Crossover <br/>
Trail begins.<br/>
Stand on the rock with a white arrow which has points on both ends. Face <br/>
70 degrees and<br/>
take eleven steps up and over rocks to find a rock trilogy. Angels <br/>
Letterbox with Bears<br/>
Gift is deep in the crevice. Hide it back well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The story and last clue:<br/>
Excitement now was in the air as the friends neared the Table that <br/>
Butterfly had scouted<br/>
out for the gather. At last, they arrived at the intersection of Orange <br/>
and The Red Circle.<br/>
Giving greetings and hugs all around , down the red dot they marched <br/>
getting hungry for<br/>
the feast.<br/>
Oh, oh, the table is Huge. They arrived at last and found the table to <br/>
be just right. and<br/>
there was Bluebird swooping around with the Welcome Banner .<br/>
<br/>
Clue<br/>
On the Red Circle Trail between the White and Orange trail crossings, is <br/>
a large , large,<br/>
flat hunk of trap rock This is our Table. Stand at the north[ front <br/>
]corner and go about<br/>
18 steps over smaller rocks to a large flat top rock with green hair <br/>
[ferns] Bluebirds<br/>
Welcome Letterbox is tucked underneath.<br/>
<br/>
With all the feasting and visiting finished , the friends traveled east <br/>
on the White Trail ,<br/>
or north on<br/>
