                    <div class="plaintext-content">We take forever to hide our boxes, both our own and thoes we look for.<br/>
When we were hiding the first set  of our Harry Potter series we each walked <br/>
down the path away from the box then turned around to see if we can see it <br/>
from the path.  We kept adjusting it just right. I wanted to write on the <br/>
clues "walk away from the box and look back make sure it's hidden well"<br/>
but I was afraid I'd sound to much like the mom that I am.<br/>
<br/>
When we look for boxes we always take the time to hide them right. We have <br/>
noticed you can often find a box by looking at the ground, it l sometimes <br/>
looks like people have sat there or walked around there.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a certain amount of risk invoved in letterboxing that you <br/>
have to take, when you hide your own. Not all the boxes will survive. we <br/>
just hope that enough people will get to enjoy them while they are out <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we need  some more clever ways to hind them like Sir B's cool fake <br/>
rocks.<br/>

<br/>
This is so true! Sometimes a path is beaten directly to the box.  I<br/>
plan to get around this by revising clues to bring boxers in from a<br/>
different direction for a box that is developing one of these paths.<br/>

I'd like to find some glue that would hold up to our winters and then<br/>
make my own "fake" rock piles complete with sticks.  Something nice &amp;<br/>
heavy.  He-he-he.<br/>

I think the addition of sticks would be interesting, thanks! Making a <br/>
fake pile of rocks is also a novel thought. <br/>
<br/>
Not sure what glue you would need for your climate but surely a <br/>
hardware store could help there.<br/>
<br/>
Fake rocks can be made of an oven-hardening clay and then sprayed <br/>
with sealant like Krylon. <br/>
<br/>
My plaster/mache' ones have not yet withstood our winter, admittedly <br/>
mild but wet. Will let you know of successes and failures after we <br/>
get some rain. <br/>
<br/>
Hollowing out real rocks like travertine or pumice is also an option. <br/>
Gardening stores might be a good place to look. Make sure you wear <br/>
respiratory, hand, and eye protection while doing this with a cement <br/>
bit on your drill.<br/>
<br/>
Fiberglas can also be sculpted to look like rock. Anybody doing that?<br/>
<br/>
We should have some examples at our October 4th SLO Stamping in the <br/>
Meadow in San Luis Obispo, CA, event.<br/>
<br/>
Please, let us keep up with these ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Drill ye tarriers, drill,<br/>

You know there is a trick when painting with gouache (opaque<br/>
watercolor) which is notorious for lifting when touched again with the<br/>
brush: mix into it, or the water, a little bit of acrylic medium. This<br/>
solves the problem, of course you can't go back &amp; take it off the<br/>
paper if a mistake is made but you can go over the mistake with more<br/>
paint.....maybe something like this would work is S. CA where the<br/>
winters are mild but sometimes wet?  You would need to fiddle with the<br/>
quantity of acrylic in the mix, and it comes in matt finish. You could<br/>
even mix sand or other goodies into it.<br/>
