You all sound like me last year.  Here on Mount Desert Island, even in the middle of winter, we were used to getting rain when it snowed.  Even if it snowed in the winter it would usually warm up and rain at the end (which I HATE!)  So last year, when we got lots of snow that stuck I was delighted.  Delighted that is until it got to be March...... and April....... and May and we kept getting snow!  Obviously it wasn't sticking for long but it was making it messy and slippery.  Last year, the last snow flake we saw fall was on the first day of JUNE!!  Let's hope this winter doesn't follow suit!<br/>
