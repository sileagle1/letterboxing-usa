displaced from its hiding spot (how does this happen?).  It was found <br/>
partially hidden under a log a ways down the trail by a non-<br/>
letterboxer (hopefully now a new letterboxer).  In a strange <br/>
coincidence, as I was proclaiming it to be missing, he was sending me <br/>
a message to say he had stumbled across it and had taken the last <br/>
information sheet.  The box has been returned to its original hiding <br/>
place ;-)<br/>

time.  <br/>
