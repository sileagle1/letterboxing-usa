&gt; What kind of nonsense is this. Everyone was a newbie at one time. <br/>
&gt; Newbies help the hobby grow. More box planters. More stamps in your <br/>
&gt; own boxes and with that will come new views. I for one have no <br/>
&gt; problems with newbies. In fact here is my opinion: WELCOME NEWBIES.<br/>
&gt; If there are any questions I can help you with just ask and I will <br/>

  If Pete Rose bet on Baseball he should not go in the Hall of Fame (I'm I cincy Kid) so most people here have comments because I think if he did bet is the game, he should not go in.<br/>
<br/>
 What does this have to do with letterboxing  (I have not a Clue) Which is how I feel about some of the bashing message that I have read.<br/>
<br/>
 If YOU are really getting Upset with a message, Then send them a Private E-Mail message, It's not like everyone's E-Mail address is not at the top of each posting.<br/>
<br/>
 Most people get turned off by reading Garbage messages.  Everyone has an Opion and everyone is right.  If you don't feel that way, Take it to a Private E-Mail and spare the rest of us<br/>
all the Garbage message's.  <br/>
<br/>
 I am here like everyone is, To have<br/>
a little Fun!!<br/>

  Thanks,  Happy Hunting<br/>
