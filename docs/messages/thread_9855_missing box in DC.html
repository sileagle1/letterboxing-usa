<br/>
On christmas eve after a half day of work and in the snow, I was <br/>
scampering about Washington DC following clues and finding boxes.  <br/>
What a wonderful time, I had! **smile**<br/>
<br/>
However, there is one that I was unable to locate: Orion the Hunter.  <br/>
I fear that it may be MIA.  I reviewed the clues several times and <br/>
searched low and high to no avail. <br/>

I hope you found others in DC.  I enjoy reading about letterboxing <br/>

Yes, I was able to find 3 others that day.  I probably was searching <br/>
the wrong tree. LOL (however, I have not shown up in the headlines as <br/>
of yet "pervert molests cedar tree near State Department") I was <br/>
trying to be inconspicuous. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I will try again. :)  Oakleaf<br/>
