Hello there. I'm a British Letterboxer... Don't stop reading, I <br/>
need help.<br/>
I'm coming to the US next week and I'm spending a few days in <br/>
Southern Ohio maybe around Cincinnati (but not fixed). I wondered <br/>
if anyone could tell me if there is a particular area in Southern <br/>
Ohio that has a large collection of letterboxes within easy reach of <br/>
each other? I've seen the long list of clues on the website, but <br/>
it's tricky to know which area to concentrate on without knowing the <br/>
area at all. It would be cool to get as many as I can in less than <br/>
24 hours. If there are particular scenic area's that have a number <br/>
of boxes, that would be very very cool. If anyone could suggest a <br/>
town, park or area to concentrate on, I'd be very grateful.<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance<br/>
<br/>
