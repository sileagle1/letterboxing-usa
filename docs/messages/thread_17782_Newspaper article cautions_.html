                    <div class="plaintext-content">My opinion of newspaper articles on letterboxing has changed since <br/>
Gwen and I started letterboxing. At first when there was only 14 <br/>
letterboxes in Ca. we pushed for an article in one of our <br/>
neighborhood newspapers. It was written and the article generated <br/>
another article being written in an Orange Co. newspaper. With an <br/>
influx of new letterboxers that come into our sport/hobby from just <br/>
reading about it, many letterboxes tend to suffer from over exposure <br/>
and non descrete finders. I believe the best way folks join our hobby <br/>
is by word of mouth as the hobby is more completely explained. I <br/>
don't want this to sound too elitest but I believe that recruiting <br/>
members via newspaper articles is not warranted unless it would be in <br/>
an area that is barren of letterboxes. That being said, since an <br/>
article seems to be around the corner, try to stress the descetion, <br/>
stealth and secrecy required by new finders. My Too Cents.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I, too, was approached this past summer for a television interview by a local commentator who wanted to do a feature on letterboxing - follow me around with a camera while Sue and I hit the trails. My first opinion was that it might be good for this pastime - you know, promote it, more people - more boxes, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I was wise enough [surprising! I know] to ask the question of this talk list. The overwelming answer came back to leave things as they are. No publicity - keep this pastime as word-of-mouth, much the same way Sue &amp; I were first introduced to letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
The one response I remember was from Butterfly. Her only response to me via email was "Shhhhhhh!" I think that sums it up in my opinion.<br/>

Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! [with not too much publicity!!!] <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Make it very clear to the reporter how important secrecy and<br/>
discretion are to the hobby when you are explaining it. The advantage<br/>
of spreading letterboxing by word of mouth is that you can show<br/>
exactly how the game is played, while newspaper articles are really<br/>
second-hand information and maybe not quite correct. If your area is<br/>
suddenly flooded with newcomers who don't understand how important it<br/>
is to be discreet and to re-hide boxes well, some boxes may indeed end<br/>
up trashed by vandals. <br/>
<br/>
So I wouldn't worry about what not to say, just stress the importance<br/>
of secrecy and explain why you are reluctant to talk to reporters. If<br/>
the writer "gets it" he/she will be able to give the article the right<br/>
tone.<br/>

Sad as it may seem, there are people who will be drawn by the mere <br/>
mention of the word "secret" and their great need to destroy it. <br/>
It's just too enticing to ignore. IMO, keep it simple, bland and <br/>
boring. Then only those who are truly of the letterboxing spirit <br/>
will be able to see through the fog. <br/>

You always want to recruit new people but you have to be careful that they are responsible, environmentally conscientious individuals. Caves take millions of years to form and one careless "spelunker" can do irreparable damage. Since back surgery ended my caving in 1999 I have been looking for more "above ground" activities, although I still camp with my grotto, and was thrilled to stumble onto letterboxing on one of my hikes. I will be discussing it at my monthly grotto meeting this Thursday as these are the coolest, most environmentally friendly folks I know. Most are avid hikers (you do a lot of hiking looking for cave entrances!) and several are already into geo-caching. Cavers already do something like this called "Cave Stash". The cavers motto "Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints, kill nothing but time." is also very similar to the Letterboxing<br/>
 motto of "Leave no Trace". This is a tough issue, how to avoid the "knuckleheads". Good luck!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I suggest you reread the Letterboxing.org guidelines and FAQs.  <br/>
<br/>
I like to stress that letterboxers avoid placing at fragile sites <br/>
like those that are environmentally sensitive or historically <br/>
significant.<br/>
<br/>
I am of two minds about the publicity thing.  The DC area really got <br/>
going after an article in the Weekend section of the Washington <br/>
Post.  That's a big circulation.  It inspired a lot of activity but <br/>
not "too much".  I agree with the comment that articles are good to <br/>
get a low activity area going.  Yet I don't believe in teaching it <br/>
to large classrooms or scouting groups for fear of vandalism.  <br/>
<br/>
I think if you emphasize the art and nature aspects you have already <br/>
lost the interest of the potential vandals.  Emphasizing the careful <br/>
placement away from sensitive areas or large groups of people, and <br/>
you avoid the notice of suspiciious authorritys.<br/>
<br/>
Personally it only took seeing the cover of the Weekend section, <br/>
with a photo of someone running through the woods with directions in <br/>
hand, and the word letterboxing, and I knew this was something Very <br/>
interesting.  I stole the paper off someone's desk to read it.<br/>

Oh thank you for those words Brian. Seems as though those EXACT words<br/>
have come out of my mouth much too often since I started this game.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, the less the general public knows, the better. The more we<br/>
try and explain, the more it becomes like the phone game and the more<br/>
the clues and the boxes and eventually the entire sport becomes<br/>
watered down. Yuck! I'm all for secrecy and hoarding of my sacred<br/>
boxes and clues. <br/>

There was also a small article in a local Plainfield, CT paper which discussed a box planted near a local library. I, for one, was glad to see stuff about our new hobby in print. But, I also understand the need to be cautious. I, myself, have had bad experiences with what a journalist writes after interviewing me.

  I gotta agree (reluctantly;) with Mark here. Let folk find out on <br/>
  their own. It will give them a greater appreciation for the game. <br/>
  There has been enough spoon-feeding already. Most of the older <br/>
  players gravitated to each other because of common interest and <br/>
  curiosity. Not because they happened upon a "FamilyFun" mag at their <br/>
  dentist. An appreciation comes from that "Oh, Wow! This is so very <br/>
  cool!" not from the "Oh, this looks like it might be something <br/>
  interesting to do with the kids this weekend." type of mind-set. When <br/>
  you realize just how lucky you have been to discover it at all, you <br/>
  will come in with greater respect and admiration for those that <br/>
  created and nurtured the game from the very beginning, appreciating <br/>
  and respecting them for allowing you to join in something so wondrous <br/>
  and intriguing. Enjoy the game the way they found it and not feel <br/>
  they have to change things. <br/>

That's how I feel about it, too (except that it was not the "original<br/>
article" but the article in Prevention Magazine). I am absolutely glad that<br/>
I live in an area that has had letterboxing exposure through the press,<br/>
because there are enough boxes around already to maintain my interest.<br/>

found out about letterboxing from a neighborhood paper and I love <br/>

letterboxing presence when I started over a year ago.  If it weren't <br/>
for the paper I would not be in this great hobby.  <br/>
The article I read was informative and interesting enough to grab my <br/>
attention, but it did not include an webite address.  Anybody who <br/>
wanted to find out about it had to find the website themselves, a <br/>
step that people who are just interested in causing problems probably <br/>
wouldn't bother with.<br/>

article but I don't think the article caused any problems in this <br/>

Newspapers and magazines have space to fill. Anything new or<br/>
interesting that is perceived as something readers might want to know<br/>
about is fair game. Rustypuff and I took this into consideration when<br/>
trying to decide whether or not to be interviewed for the Providence<br/>
Journal. We decided we'd rather be a source of correct and responsible<br/>
information, than to allow a reporter to cobble something together on<br/>
his own.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else who agrees to be interviewed for an article (or TV) should<br/>
be ready to take on the same responsibility, not only to expound the<br/>
"Leave no trace" philosophy, but to present the hobby in a positive<br/>
and unembellished light.<br/>

I tend to agree with Don &amp; Gwen (as usual) that newspapers may not be <br/>
the best way to spread news about our past-time, but if anyone would <br/>
be a great spokesperson about letterboxing it would certainly be you. <br/>
I love the serendipitous way I learned about 'boxing--letterboxing <br/>
seemed so mysterious and secret--which made me respect it so much, <br/>
and want to learn as much as I could about it.  That said, I'm sure <br/>
that whatever you do with the reporters will be just great.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I enjoy the way letterboxing is like finding a secret treasure map, or Mr. Phelps getting his orders.  The sort of cabalistic secrecy of finding That Which Is Unknown To Common Man is fun.  Having said that, I'm also not one to hog all the fun (No offense, Funhog :) !), and the newspaper articles seem to have mostly just identified a fun hobby for folks of like minds to ours (poor guys).<br/>

  Hi Doublesaj,<br/>
  I tend to agree with Don &amp; Gwen (as usual) that newspapers may not be <br/>
  the best way to spread news about our past-time, but if anyone would <br/>
  be a great spokesperson about letterboxing it would certainly be you. <br/>
  I love the serendipitous way I learned about 'boxing--letterboxing <br/>
  seemed so mysterious and secret--which made me respect it so much, <br/>
  and want to learn as much as I could about it.  That said, I'm sure <br/>
  that whatever you do with the reporters will be just great.<br/>

Excellent point!<br/>
<br/>
Actually, the interview went very well. Obviously a rather new reporter--we <br/>
could tell because she was sweet and rather meek and let us finish what we were <br/>
saying before asking another question. The photographer never said a word, <br/>
just took many photos of our paraphernalia and me carving a stamp. They SEEMED <br/>
like responsible young people. <br/>
<br/>
We'll keep you posted on what the article actually provides to the <br/>
soon-to-be- NEWBIE community!<br/>
