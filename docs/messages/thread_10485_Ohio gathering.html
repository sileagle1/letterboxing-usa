  SI:3 and the Gathering are two different Events.  I was hoping to have <br/>
something on both day's so people who would like to come out from the far <br/>
reaches of the state can make a weekend trip out of it.<br/>
<br/>
June is a good time to Visit Cincinnati, From a Hotel in Cincinnati or <br/>
N.Kentucky, It's only a 20 min trip to SI:3 or Miami Whitewater. Thye Night <br/>
life in June is also great.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hiking<br/>

<br/>
We are new to this letterboxing stuff. We would like to be added to <br/>
your list as competitors in the SI:3 event.<br/>
<br/>
Also there is a large Girl Scout day camp at MWF beginning the week <br/>
of the 16th. We typically set up camp there that Sunday and camp a <br/>
few days during that week. With that said, we may be able to help out <br/>
on Sunday with the gathering and it could be an excellent opportunity <br/>
to introduce letterboxing to 150+ Girl Scouts during the week.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think.<br/>
