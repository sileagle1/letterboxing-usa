                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just saw a commercial for the channel 30 (NBC) in CT for a news feature (although I missed when it would air - sorry) called Destination Education. It said it was going to cover 1) the Dinosaur Park 2) how your family can find treasures in the woods of CT. The clip they showed was someone holding a compass in the woods. <br/>
Has anyone heard that they are doing a feature on letterboxing or am I jumping to conclusions??<br/>

understand it, one feature will be on letterboxing in CT's State Forests, with the <br/>
emphasis on letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Should be fun to watch.<br/>
