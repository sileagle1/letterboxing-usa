"Hey Bayletterbox!  Are you the one that found Mt. Tabor and Tryon Creek<br/>
here a couple weeks ago..."<br/>
<br/>
 yes I was in Seattle and Portland area for few days for my work,<br/>
couldn't resist trying to score a letterbox, just sorry there wasn't more<br/>
time. maybe again someday. The parks were wonderful, it was just a little<br/>
foggy, a nice day in Portland, I was surprised at the Mt Tabor location ,<br/>
very creative! <br/>
<br/>
i try to keep a rough record of where things are, if I get back I'll be<br/>
ready for more. <br/>
	An early corporate logo for a certain paint company was a chameleon, and<br/>
since this company had the courtesy to send me to the west coast....<br/>
your comments made me LOL! thanks! <br/>
best of 'boxin' to y'all <br/>
