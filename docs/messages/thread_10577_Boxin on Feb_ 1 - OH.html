<div>Yesterday, I spent the day boxin' with Franzsolo. 
With his guidance (so I didn't get totally lost of the East side), we 
trekked around East Fork Park &amp; Mariemont. We had East Fork almost to 
ourselves. It was a bit cold, but bearable. Myself &amp; my dogs had a great 
time and slept soundly last night! Other than one box, all were in good 
shape. I have several very beautiful stamps added to my collection. I think 
we walked about 10 miles and most of it seemed to be uphill :-) It felt so 
good to get back out and walk in the woods. I've been so busy with our move that 
I just haven't had the time &amp; the dogs were going stir crazy. 
Thanks Franzsolo for a great day! </div>
