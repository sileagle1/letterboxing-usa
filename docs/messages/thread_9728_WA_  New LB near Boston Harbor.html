Boston Harbor (7 miles North of Olympia)<br/>
Thurston County<br/>
Washington<br/>
<br/>
Level of difficulty: Level to steep dirt/gravel trail (portions are <br/>
mucky in rainy season) with stairs, boardwalks and sand along some <br/>
stretches.  Clues easy.<br/>
<br/>
Setting: Burfoot Park covers 50 acres with 1,000 feet of saltwater <br/>
beach frontage on Budd Inlet.  Nature trails and beach access with <br/>
beautiful views of State Capitol and Olympic Mountains.<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  A couple of hiking trails, a rhododendron trail and an <br/>
excellently marked nature trail are found in this unique park which <br/>
also offers playgrounds, picnic pavilions, beach access &amp; a <br/>
driftwood-filled lagoon. <br/>
<br/>
Facilities: Bathrooms, picnic tables &amp; water fountains.  Open from <br/>
9am-dusk. <br/>
<br/>
Restrictions: Leash and scoop laws in effect for pets. <br/>
<br/>
Length of trek:  approx. 1-1/2 mile roundtrip (for both letterboxes)<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Take I-5 Exit 109 (Martin Way) and continue West for a <br/>
couple of miles.  As you approach the downtown area, look for a <br/>
small brown sign to Priest Point Park telling you to turn right.  <br/>
This will be East Bay Dr. NE.  Continue North on East Bay Dr. NE for <br/>
6-1/2 miles (the road will turn into Boston Harbor Rd NE after <br/>
awhile).  Turn left into Burfoot County Park and park near the <br/>
playgrounds. <br/>
<br/>
Big Foot, Bare Foot in Burfoot Letterbox:  <br/>
<br/>
Rumor has it that Big Foot wasn't just a figment of one man's <br/>
imagination (who recently died).  He was actually seen spotted in <br/>
this park.  From the playground's kitchen, head 40 degrees to the <br/>
Butterfly Garden.  Follow the stepping stones, perhaps Big Foot is <br/>
behind the bushes?  At the last stepping stone, turn right and cross <br/>
the road.  Oh, I think I see him!  Follow the trail toward the <br/>
beach.  Faster, he's getting away!  Go straight, past 3 benches on <br/>
the left, stay right at the `Y' with a bench.  Head right and up 3 <br/>
steps.  Right again.  I think we're on his tail.  He's headed down <br/>
the steps.  There he is across the bridge!  Oh, I'm tired.  Take a <br/>
rest at the bench.  Oh, but you don't have time to rest.  You need <br/>
to catch Big Foot!  Down more steps!  Bend left then continue down <br/>
to another bridge.  Oh, noyou can't see him anymore.  He must've <br/>
gotten away.  All that's left is a gravel trail and another <br/>
boardwalk.  Oopstoo far!  I think I see something in the log to the <br/>
right just before the boardwalk.  Look in the far end of the 1st <br/>
large (3' diameter/10' long) old growth log in the right up the <br/>
hill.  Ohthere it is!  Evidence!!!  Big Foot, Bare Foot in Burfoot <br/>
resides within!!!  Continue to the beach.  Beach comb for a bit and <br/>
return to the trail.  After the boardwalk, cross another boardwalk <br/>
and turn right at the `T'.  Take the trail uphill, across 2 bridges, <br/>
a large set of stairs, past a bench to the right, past the `To <br/>
Beach' sign and turn left to the parking lot.  Don't leave though <br/>
before you find the pileated woodpecker!<br/>

Pileated Woodpecker Letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Start at the Horizon Trail Nature Loop Trailhead (south of the <br/>
playground).  Look for these indicators:  red huckleberry, grand <br/>
fir, Indian plum, licorice ferns, Douglas fir, LEFT, Western Red <br/>
Cedar, red alder, BENCH, Western hemlock, springboard, nurse stump &amp; <br/>
BENCH, woodpecker hole, wedged in springboards, broadleaf <br/>
maple, `Y', BENCH, LEFT, Douglas fir nurse stump, hemlock &amp; cedar, <br/>
pileated woodpecker, BENCH WITH A BACK, sit down, look right, see <br/>
Cedar 2' stump behindthe real pileated woodpecker is within, <br/>
hazelnut bush, big leaf maples  <br/>
<br/>
One of these cute little woodpeckers put on a grand show for us <br/>
about 3' away as we were placing this box.  He was a tiny little <br/>
fellow (quite young, I presume) but completely unafraid of us. <br/>
