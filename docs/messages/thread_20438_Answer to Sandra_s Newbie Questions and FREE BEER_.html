realized that I am the re-incarnation of Ethel Merman.<br/>
Letterboxing is great isn't it? You'll be swell, you'll be great,<br/>
gonna have the whole world on a plate. I have some answers for you:<br/>
<br/>
Hitchhikers are people that you pick up on the side of the road.<br/>
Once you pick them up you can tie them to the front seat and make<br/>
them listen to your impersonations until they vomit, pass out, or<br/>
both.<br/>
<br/>
I like to use toilet paper in my boxes. That way if finders forget<br/>
their stamps they can leave a different kind of artistic impression<br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
I carry my supplies in my strait jacket. My arms are usually<br/>
strapped so tight to my back that I can shove just about anything in<br/>
there without fear of losing it. Well, there was that one time<br/>
where I burst into an elaborate song and dance number and lost my<br/>
ink pad....<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
<br/>
Ethel<br/>

you are supposed to drive straight to the nearest letterbox gathering <br/>
where you can pass him around and let everyone have their way with <br/>
him.<br/>

p.s. are you by any chance the Ethel who was incensed by that <br/>
streaker guy back in the 70's?  It was probably just a nude <br/>
letterboxer.<br/>
