  I've had a sneak peek at this stamp and it makes the trip to the Wendell Gathering worthwhile! Come one and all to the birthday celebration of the summer~ Gingerblue and I have fun and festivities planned for all. The weather sounds perfect so we hope see you there!<br/>

<br/>
We're pretty excited, but then we have a lot to be excited about <br/>
right now.  We start a two-week vacation tonight!  (happy dance)<br/>
<br/>
We're driving out to Kingston, NY, tonight to leave the Nina-dog with <br/>
my mom.  Then we'll backtrack in the morning to Wendell.  Having <br/>
someone to take the Nina-dog for bathroom breaks means more time to <br/>
box!  Yay!  Hope I find that elusive Antionne de St-Exupery this time.<br/>
<br/>
Then we leave for California early, early Tuesday morning.  Looking <br/>
forward to meeting a few Bay Area boxers (you know who you are), and <br/>
finding many Bay Area boxes, you bet!<br/>
<br/>
What time is it?  Can't I leave work yet?  Man, this day is dragging!<br/>
