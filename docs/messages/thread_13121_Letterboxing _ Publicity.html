In my opinion, while this type of exposure may invite new letterboxers, at the same time it may also invite unwanted vandalism, attention from officials in places where there has been peaceful coexistence and more irresponsibility with regard to LNT. <br/>
<br/>
On another level, in a state like Connecticut with, I believe, more letterboxes and perhaps letterboxers than any other state (I'm sure someone will tell me loud and clear if I am wrong about this), it may drive those who have a different perception of how letterboxing is played to do things...well... in a different way. More plainly stated, some clues could be harder to find than the letterboxes themselves.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would have to agree with Linda.  For those really interested or <br/>
seeking out an outdoor activity/hobby, there are ways to "stumble" on <br/>
letterboxing.  I am especially concerned about the heads up this <br/>
gives to park rangers, etc. in places where there has not been a <br/>
formal stance on letterboxing one way or the other and we have been, <br/>
as Linda says, "peacefully co-existing."<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that just knowing the local park rangers knew about my <br/>
boxes in the state park here, made me nervous.  Not that I had done <br/>
anything against the rules, but only because there were no rules <br/>
either way and learning of the boxes put them in a position to make a <br/>
decision, do they allow it, or not.  Since the volume of visitors is <br/>
relatively low around here and they felt none of the box locations <br/>
was having a negative impact on the environment, they are okay with <br/>
it -- for now.  That could all change with significantly increased <br/>
traffic, or if the sites begin to show environmental strain.<br/>
<br/>
Publicity means exposure and more involvement, possibly negative on <br/>
both counts.<br/>
