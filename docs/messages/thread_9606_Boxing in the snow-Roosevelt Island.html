couldn't find it either!<br/>

I remember back in the summer the box placers (I can't remember who that was <br/>
at the moment) had indicated that they were going to check the box the next <br/>
time they were in the area.  I don't recall hearing anything about it one <br/>
way or another (I know, lots of memory problems -- getting old -- or <br/>
temporary cerebral paralysis contemplating another possible snow day <br/>
tomorrow!)<br/>
<br/>
I would also love to hear if that box is still there or not.  Thanks!  BeMa<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  It's amazing we kept letterboxing after that first box.  We got poison <br/>
ivy, stung by a bee and left in defeat!  But, the trails were pretty and we <br/>
saw lots of dogs too.<br/>

I thought, if they get many inquiries, perhaps the instructions were<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Roosevelt Island letterbox was the second letterbox I ever <br/>
found, on August 7th.  It was very difficult to find because the <br/>
directions and all the paths are very confusing.  But the <br/>
description of the bridge view and the compass work can still lead <br/>
you to it.  Actually I was quite proud that I found it via deduction <br/>
despite being lost on the many paths.  And we liked the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
The key to finding it is realizing which side of the island you can <br/>
clearly see that end of Key Bridge from and that there are only a <br/>
couple of rock outcroppings in that area.  One rock outcropping is <br/>
big and easy to find, the other small and not so.  Unfortunately you <br/>
could fudge the compass readings when you are at the wrong spot and <br/>
think you're at the right place when you're not.  We spent a lot of <br/>
time at the wrong rocks.<br/>
<br/>
If I didn't know exactly where to look I would not attempt it in the <br/>
snow: there is no landmark where it actually is since it's not at <br/>
the base of a tree or something.<br/>
<br/>
I was shocked to recognize the same rocks in a photograph on the <br/>
wall in a coworker's office.  Behind the soldiers standing on the <br/>
rocks could be seen the same view of Georgetown and it's bridge <br/>
described in the clues.  The photo was taken during the civil war.<br/>

Happy hunting,<br/>

&gt; I thought, if they get many inquiries, perhaps the instructions <br/>
were<br/>
&gt; kind of vague and asked for clarification, but got no response.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I remember back in the summer the box placers (I can't remember <br/>
who<br/>
&gt; that was <br/>
&gt; &gt; at the moment) had indicated that they were going to check the <br/>
box<br/>
&gt; the next <br/>
&gt; &gt; time they were in the area.  I don't recall hearing anything <br/>
about<br/>
&gt; it one <br/>
&gt; &gt; way or another (I know, lots of memory problems -- getting old --<br/>
 or <br/>
&gt; &gt; temporary cerebral paralysis contemplating another possible snow <br/>
day <br/>
&gt; &gt; tomorrow!)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I would also love to hear if that box is still there or not. <br/>
&gt; Thanks!  BeMa<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; P.S.  It's amazing we kept letterboxing after that first box.  We<br/>
&gt; got poison <br/>
&gt; &gt; ivy, stung by a bee and left in defeat!  But, the trails were <br/>
pretty<br/>
&gt; and we <br/>
&gt; &gt; saw lots of dogs too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Frostpup and I couldn't find the Roosevelt Island one before <br/>
the snow.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Of the 19 listed on the LbNA Web site, that's the only one we <br/>
haven't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;found for DC.  (Not counting the one marked missing in Kid <br/>
Gloves.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;We'll try once more after the thaw.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well we decided to try for it, but the snow defeated us.  I <br/>
guess we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shouldn't have tried for one that specified 'vague' trail.  <br/>
That<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vague trail was nowhere to be found covered by snow.  But we <br/>
had a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great walk on Roosevelt Island with our dog and enjoyed the <br/>
scenery.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only kinda creepy part was that on the way off the <br/>
island we saw<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bits of blood spattered snow and we followed the drops off <br/>
blood all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the way back to the parking lot.  Probably just someone with <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nosebleed or something, but following a blood trail in the <br/>
wee hours<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the morning on a fairly deserted island had a very surreal<br/>
&gt; quality<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about it!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can't wait to go back when the snow melts and we can find <br/>
the trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this time!<br/>
