Dear Kathy and Lenny,<br/>
  It might be wise to keep Ozzy on a leash particularly because it is <br/>
hunting season...we once found the most beautiful Irish Setter that <br/>
had been shot. I will never forget it.<br/>
 There are orange vests sold for dogs as well as people. We want Ozzy <br/>
to be around for a long, long time.<br/>

$5.87. For that, you can even buy one for the dog. What a bargain!<br/>
