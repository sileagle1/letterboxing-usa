I previously got them from April at Stampeaz, but she is out, as is <br/>
my secondary source, Du-All Art Supply.  I called three other <br/>
art/office suppliers and none to be found.  Checked Dick Blick and <br/>
they do not stock this size.<br/>
<br/>
The story I got from two different places it that although the <br/>
company (in Germany) is still making them, the US supplier that all <br/>
these places use, has discontinued the product.<br/>
<br/>
I don't generally use these as they are more costly than other <br/>
carving materials, but they are convenient size for doing a class.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is getting these online and would care to share your <br/>
supplier, I would be most appreciative.  Thanks!<br/>

No Du-All!!!  That's who I usually order from.  Actually I just ended <br/>
up ordering from Dick Blick.  I ordered the 4x4x1/2 blocks that are <br/>
very affordable.  That was the best/most affordable alternative I <br/>
could find.<br/>

Don't have an online source, but an art supply store in Richmond, VA, <br/>
might be able to help. I discovered Plaza recently and was talking to <br/>
its inventory manager-type person. Plaza is only a couple of blocks <br/>
away from Virginia Commonwealth University's art department, and she <br/>
mentioned that Staedtler Mars erasers are very popular with the art <br/>
students for stamping and printmaking. She said she had discovered at <br/>
a recent trade show several new sources for various sizes. Maybe <br/>
Plaza can help: 804-359-5900. Hours are Monday thru Friday, 8:30-6 <br/>
EDT, Saturdays 12-5 EDT.<br/>

You might want to try contacting I'd Rather be Stamping in Columbia,<br/>
Missouri <irbs@tranquility.net>.  I know that they have a fairly good<br/>
supply of the Mars Grands.  Tell him I sent you and you'll probably even<br/>
get a pretty good price.  :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the source, Marsha.  I ended up ordering Marscarve blocks <br/>
and will just cut them down to size.  It is cheaper and you don't <br/>

sense using the Grand erasers for the class if it was something that <br/>
they wouldn't be able to use in the future anyway.<br/>
