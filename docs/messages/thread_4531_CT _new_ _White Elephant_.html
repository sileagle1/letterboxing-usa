<br/>
Webmaster (Jay), thank you for posting the clues to the Unknown <br/>
Artist letterbox.  I'm sorry to be such a complainer, but the <br/>
word "Artist" is mispelled -- it says "Artisit" instead of "Artist". <br/>
It's wrong on the What's New? page and on the Eastern Connecticut <br/>
page. But what is even worse is that neither of these links is <br/>
working!  It seems to add the domain name of www.letterboxing.org <br/>
onto the front of the URL.  I looked at the HTML to see why it was <br/>
doing that.  On the Eastern Connecticut page, the <a ...="" href=""> tag <br/>
said:<br/>
<a href="../lbna/%&lt;br&gt;
20http:/www.geocities.com/thomsen_k/letterboxing/clues/unknown.htm"><br/>
when it should be:<br/>
<a <br="">
href="http://www.geocities.com/thomsen_k/letterboxing/clues/unknown.h<br/>
tm"&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On the What's New? page, it said:<br/>
<a <br="">
href="http:/www.geocities.com/thomsen_k/letterboxing/clues/unknown.ht<br/>
m"&gt;<br/>
which at first might appear to be correct, but what is wrong is that <br/>
it is missing the second slash / after the http:<br/>
<br/>
Well, I apologize for going on and on like that.  Maybe some of that <br/>
will be helpful.  I know that you have been very busy, what with the <br/>
CA updates and everything.  Thank you for all your help and hard <br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
