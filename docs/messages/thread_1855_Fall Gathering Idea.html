it would be nice if we held it at one of the State Parks. The location <br/>
could be announced well ahead of time. Then various letterboxers could <br/>
place letterboxes at the Park in advance of the Gathering. If enough people <br/>
were willing to plant them, they could each plant one. It would be great to <br/>
get 6 to 10 new letterboxes planted in advance. That way everybody, <br/>
including the planters would have boxes to seek out.<br/>
<br/>
Where and when would we have it? I have a suggestion for that too, although <br/>
I certainly understand the need to diversify our locations. I would <br/>
recommend Chatfield Hollow State Park. It's in Killingworth Connecticut. It <br/>
is a wonderful park and is especially nice for picnics. It can easily <br/>
accommodate the number of letterboxers who would descend upon the park. It <br/>
has trails and, I believe, it doesn't currently have any letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?<br/>

I would like to suggest Burlingame in Charlestown.  It also has a <br/>
nice covered picnic pavilion, a great campground, several miles <br/>
of "unboxed" trails and is within 1/2 an hour of many of the boxes <br/>
already planted in coastal RI.  Plus, haven't the last two been in CT?<br/>

I may be jumping the gun just a bit, but there is a slim possibility that<br/>
there may be a gathering in the Pacific NW in April.  The Nature Park that<br/>
sponsored my last series of letterboxes has contacted me with an offer to<br/>
salt the park with a few more boxes and host a letterboxing booth on April<br/>
28th.  They will be celebrating Earth Day at the Park thought letterboxing<br/>
was a good addition (another notch in our 'Leave No Trace" belt!).  I have<br/>
mentioned this to Amanda &amp; will be including Mitch as well (of course!).<br/>
So....  calling ALL letterboxers!!  Pacific NW Letterboxing Summit #2!!!<br/>

Glad to hear you enjoyed the gathering last weekend and would like to<br/>
have another one!  I suggest that gatherings be held at parks with<br/>
campgrounds whenever possible.  So many of us are campers and this<br/>
allows travel from a greater distance.  I know of some Vermonters who<br/>
would want to come camp down in your area.<br/>

&gt; Thom, please keep us posted.  Where is this Nature Park? What's the<br/>
&gt; closest airport?<br/>
<br/>
It is about 10 miles west of downtown Portland.  200+ acres in Beaverton...<br/>
near Nike.  Portland, It'l airport is about 1/2 hour away.  I'll post full<br/>
details as they become available.<br/>

I think Burlingame is also a fine choice. Susan (I think it was her) <br/>
suggested a park with camping facilities and Burlingame certainly has that. <br/>
I checked and Chatfield Hollow doesn't have camping.<br/>
<br/>
The actual location is unimportant to me. I just thought a State Park type <br/>
place without any letterboxes would be a great location. That way it could <br/>
be seeded, in advance with letterboxes for ALL to seek. Plus I love to have <br/>
a picnic in a State Park. For those others who also do and haven't <br/>
picnicked at Chatfield Hollow, I strongly recommend it. Whether it's a <br/>
large group, or a romantic picnic for two, this place can do it. I also <br/>
would love it if someone planted some boxes there!<br/>
<br/>
I also think Fall is better than Summer. Not as hot and less buggy.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like there will be a northwest Gathering in April. The more the <br/>
merrier I say. Particularly as boxing spreads out across the entire country.<br/>
