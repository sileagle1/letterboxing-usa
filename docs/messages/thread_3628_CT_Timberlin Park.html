<div>Three brand new letterboxes waiting to be found at 
Timberlin Park in Berlin, CT. This is a moderate hike with rolling terrain and 
one steep, short climb. This climb however can get very icy in the winter 
months. Figure about 1 1/2 to 2 hours total hiking time.</div>
<div>To get there, take 91 South or North to Rt 9 North. 
Take the left exit marked Rt 372. Continue all the way to the lights at the end 
of the long exit. Turn left onto Rt 71A.</div>
<div>This road turns into Rt. 71 so don't worry. Go 
three miles and turn right onto Rt 364. Park entrance is on the right hand 
side about three quarters of a mile.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>During Golfing season 
you should go through the parking lot and continue down into 
the road and park nearest the pavilion. This is your starting point. 
If during winter months the gate will be closed so you will have to walk to 
the pavilion. This hike is a counter-clockwise loop that is seldom used in 
sections.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"<strong>Pinecone</strong>"</div>
<div>Start at the pavilion and find the white trail at 
the North side of the pavilion. Take the switchback left and continue down on 
the faded orange trail. Cross the stream at the wooden bridge. Once on the other 
side, the trail is now marked in yellow. About 20 to 30 minutes into the hike 
you will walk over a low 2 plank bridge. As the trail bends slightly left, look 
right at a tree that has been struck by lightning. This is about 17 paces(one 
footfall per pace) from the trail. The "pinecone" letterbox is hidden in a cairn 
at the back of the tree. Continue on the yellow trail being mindful of the trail 
markings indicating redirection. Descend into a valley (icy during winter) and 
hike over to the railed wooden bridge.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"<strong>Timberland Park</strong>" </div>
<div>At the bridge, do not cross. Go left and follow the 
now blue blazed trail. This will bring you up the cliff face that you recently 
descended. One more warning, this is an icy spot in the winter. Keep to the 
newly blazed trees for this section has been rerouted slightly. The blue blazed 
trail will generally follow the ridgeline south. At approx 50 to 60 minutes into 
the hike you will come upon a solitary cedar tree at an overlook with blue 
blazes. Close by is another cedar tree that was felled by weather. At its base, 
hidden deep under the roots, you will find the "Timberland Park" letterbox. Once 
you have stamped in, please rehide carefully. This is a likely party spot for 
some. Continue on the blue trail to the next and last box.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"<strong>Ball and Tee</strong>"</div>
<div>The blue trail will bring you down gently at times, 
rocky at others, until you come to a stream crossing. Stay straight after 
crossing this stream no matter what the blazes tell you. You will notice the 
golf course ahead of you. Go up the hill and find a group of large pine trees 
just shy of the sand trap. On the stream side of largest tree there is a cairn 
built into its base that hides the "Ball and Tee" box. Take the box back down 
the hill to the park bench and stamp in. Replace the box being mindful of the 
golfers on the course. A slice from the tee will be headed your way if you are 
not careful. This area is usually peppered with golf balls so rehide the box 
with debris after replacing the rocks. A prize or two is hidden in the box for 
the golfers who happen upon the box by accident. If you golf yourself, take a 
couple. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Go back down to the stream and instead of following 
the blue trail, go in the opposite direction walking approx. 20-30 yards from 
the edge of and parallel to the course. This may involve a bit of bushwhacking 
although the woods are not very heavy. You will have to change your direction 
slightly to the contours of the course but if you stay the 20-30 yards away, you 
will lessen the risk of getting bonked by an errant drive and draw less 
attention to yourself. This area is frequented by hikers so the golfing 
community is more than accommodating. Your bushwhacking will be generally 
Northeast at about 40 degrees. This will bring you back to the parking area near 
the pavilion. If you started at the main parking lot, stay on the edge of the 
course near the trees and this will bring you back to the parking lot. It will 
be winter so no golfers will be interrupted.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We hope you enjoy this loop as much as we 
do.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>PS - The "Timberland Park" stamp is misspelled and 
will be replaced with the corrected version. The new stamp will read "Timberlin 
Park" If you get the first version, it will be a rare find. The replacement will 
be out soon.</div>
