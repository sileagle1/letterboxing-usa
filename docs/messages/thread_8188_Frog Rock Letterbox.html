This is our first Letterbox. we chose the Frog Rock because when we<br/>
started letterboxing we bought a big stamp with two frogs on it.then we<br/>
came up with the name the needeeps so it only seems right that we make<br/>
frog rock our mascot.ok coming from the east on RT 44 from Pomfret the<br/>
parking area will be 0.4 of a mile from the Eastford town line sign on<br/>
the right.  coming from te west on RT 44 from Ashford the parking area<br/>
will be 2.0 miles past the Eastford sign on the left. from west use the<br/>
second parking area you see.park your car and step over the guard rail<br/>
and walk down the paved path until you get to the giant frog rock.go<br/>
directly behind the frog and take a reading of 360" degrees due north to<br/>
a cement picnic table.from the table take 11 paces over a little log to<br/>
a evergreen tree.from that tree take a reading of 270" degrees to a<br/>
bigger evergreen tree which has six visible legs between the fourth and<br/>
fifth leg is your prize.just beyond that down the path a little more is<br/>
a small stream where all the little needeeps like to spend there time on<br/>
hot summer days.hope you enjoy the rock.Lenny/Kathy<br/>
