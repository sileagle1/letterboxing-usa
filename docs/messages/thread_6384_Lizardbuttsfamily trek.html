lucky you have found some letterboxes, I haven't.  When you come back <br/>

would have a break when visiting but I'm afraid your mommy has the <br/>

Hi PyscoAunt! Better start shopping at REI or EMS for sturdy hiking <br/>
boots. Mom is GRUELLING! She does bring along great snacks(chocolate <br/>
bars), but then for drinks only water(how boring). Wished she would <br/>
put soda in that platypus. I got to go talk to her about this idea.<br/>
She is studying the topo maps of Hawaii right now.I like her better <br/>
when she watched the cooking shows. <br/>
<br/>
Off to make my own peanutbutter sandwich.<br/>
