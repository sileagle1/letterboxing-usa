drive and found it (and now I'm getting back in the middle of the night).<br/>

ZenRoxie,  this was just a beautiful box!!  I am so glad that someone took<br/>
the time to mark this spot, and the stamp is my favorite so far-wonderful.<br/>
I was honored to stamp in to this LB.  Thank you for thinking of such a<br/>
great spot.  It's a shame that this part of U.S. history seems to have been<br/>
forgotten.  <br/>
<br/>
I won't say more so I don't spoil a "mystery" for others.  Thanks for the<br/>
extras in the box.  That added to the moment.  Anyone out here should go<br/>
find this spot.<br/>
<br/>

ps. ZenRoxie, While I was out that direction, I went ahead and found that<br/>
other box we discussed.  Fun park.  Keep planting so I have more reasons to<br/>
visit. <br/>
