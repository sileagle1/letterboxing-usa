<br/>
Boxing this weekend, I experienced a 50/50 success rate of boxes found<br/>
or missing.  While I grumbled and trudged through the woods with scant<br/>
reward but for the beauty of nature I began to wonder why I was doing<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
Has it been suggested?  Box maintenance weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the more prolific of placers will have a more difficult time<br/>
and would probably have to schedule a couple more or recruit newbies<br/>
to help out.  (I try for the ratio of 1 box planted for every 10 found.)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy every season with box maintenance weeks!<br/>
<br/>
Mid December - The shortest days of the year and a break from the<br/>
holiday madness. Perhaps you have a break of a day or two from work. <br/>
A brisk walk in the Winter air and maybe a headstart on a New Year's<br/>
resolution.<br/>
<br/>
Late March - New growth and new projects.  Dry new books and baggies<br/>
for your boxes.  Did your old and faithful ones make it through the<br/>
Winter? Are they ready for the showers of April?<br/>
<br/>
Mid June - The longest days of the year and the beginning of Summer.<br/>
Get out and make the most of them before the dog days' heat hits.<br/>
<br/>
Late September - Are your boxes cracked, dry and brittle? Prepare your<br/>
boxes for the long Winter and enjoy the Autumn foliage.<br/>
<br/>

Sorry to hear you had only a 50/50 success rate.  That's too bad.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing you can do is email the placer of the box and let <br/>
them know where you were and what difficultues you had.  Then <br/>
they can determine if the box is missing or if you were in the <br/>
wrong place.  Perhaps the clue needs a little adjusting. <br/>
<br/>
In five years of letterboxing, I have found approx. 4 out of 5 boxes I <br/>
sought.  When I have been contacted by people who thought one <br/>
of my boxes was missing, about half  the time the box was <br/>
indeed gone, and about half the time they were not at the right <br/>
location. I have on a couple of occasions reworded a clue.  But if <br/>
I know people are indeed finding the box, then I leave the clue as <br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
Some clues are harder than others. Even though it is <br/>
disappointing to be unable to find a box, I remind myself that <br/>
seeing new places and getting exercise are just as important as <br/>
finding a box!<br/>
<br/>
I carry paper towels and extra Ziploc bags when I letterbox, so I <br/>
can do maintenance on boxes when they need it.  I figure, if I dry <br/>
out and clean up someone else's box, perhaps they will do the <br/>
same for mine.  In a way, all boxes belong to everybody!<br/>

At the rate that we are going we would never plant a box! LOL! I think box<br/>
maintenance weeks is a great idea! I will adopt this suggestion, though I<br/>
will twist the weeks slightly to work around whatever sport we are currently<br/>
engaging in! LOL! Kerri<br/>
