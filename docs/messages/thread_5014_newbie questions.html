                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings:<br/>
<br/>
I am fairly new to letterboxing, having never set out a box of my own, <br/>
and having only found two in the past.  So please forgive me if the <br/>
following questions are silly or old;  they are all meant sincerely and <br/>
in the spirit of trying to learn.<br/>
<br/>
There aren't any boxes placed near Nashville, that I know of, so I would <br/>
like to ask some questions about the proper protocol for placing some <br/>
boxes of my own--maybe that will spur a craze!<br/>
<br/>
1.  I understand that all boxes should be placed on public land for <br/>
obvious reasons.  Does the area on either side of Interstates count?  <br/>
I'm assuming that the federal roads department owns some land beside the <br/>
roads, and there's a gorgeous glad right next to the shoulder near here <br/>
that would be nice for a box (and not dangerous).<br/>
<br/>
2.  What about public land, but not parks--places like zoos and <br/>
university campuses?  Or would those be too populous and policed to work <br/>
well?<br/>
<br/>
3.  Do most of you include an inkpad in the box?  How do you keep the <br/>
ink wet?  My of the pads I use for crafts dry out in short order if you <br/>
don't rewet them periodically, and while I know we should try to check <br/>
the condition of our boxes every so often, I have heard of people <br/>
placing boxes while on vacation--very difficult to do upkeep on those.<br/>
<br/>
4.  How often is it advisable to revisit the box and check on things?<br/>
<br/>
5.  I've also heard of boxes being placed in cemeteries, but I can't <br/>
think of how this would work.  Most of the sites I've seen were <br/>
well-manicured and open;  are those just bad sites, or am I overlooking <br/>
a good place to stash a box?<br/>
<br/>
6.  How public is too public for a box?  A state park in Alabama has an <br/>
old Japanese garden with a teahouse.  They lost funding to keep this <br/>
section up, so it's kind of overgrown--many people in the town don't <br/>
even know it's there, but I've seen trash about, so obviously someone is <br/>
going there.  Would under a loose slat in the teahouse (there are <br/>
several loose slats) be a good place?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your tolerance and for sharing your wisdom!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It is interesting that you are in Nashville.  I have an email friend <br/>
who is also in Nashville.  She has been interested in getting <br/>
started in letterboxing, but as you say, there are not any <br/>
letterboxes very close to there.  She has been wondering how to go <br/>
about starting a letterboxing group or club in the Nashville area.  <br/>
Perhaps if both of you are interested you could exchange email <br/>
addresses -- reply to me at thomsen_k@yahoo.com if you are <br/>
interested in this, and I will get you in touch with her.<br/>
<br/>
Here are my thoughts on some of your questions... I'm sure others on <br/>
the list will help answer as well...<br/>
<br/>
2. Yes, there are several boxes that have been planted at zoos and <br/>
university campuses that I have heard about, so I think that would <br/>
work well.<br/>
<br/>
3. Some people choose to include an inkpad and some don't. There are <br/>
pros and cons for both. I think it's entirely up to you whether or <br/>
not you choose to include one.<br/>
<br/>
5.Where I live (in CT) there are lots of old historic cemeteries <br/>
which are often in state parks... the cemetaries themselves are <br/>
maintained, but still are located within surrounding wooded areas <br/>
with hiking trails... and so there are often good places for boxes <br/>
right at the edge of the cemetery.  I wouldn't expect this to be the <br/>
case with all cemeteries, though.<br/>

4 years ago there was one box by a lighthouse somewhere on the northeast<br/>
coast.<br/>
<br/>
3-1/2 years ago there was one box in Oregon.  You have to start with one.<br/>

I've heard that pigment pads, rather than ink pads, last longer and the <br/>
impressions don't run if exposed to moisture.  So I use Colorbox pigment <br/>
pads ($2 each) in all my boxes.  They're very small ovals, so take up less <br/>
space than a standard ink pad.  Have fun!<br/>
