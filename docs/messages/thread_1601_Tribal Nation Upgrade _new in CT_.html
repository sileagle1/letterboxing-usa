Tribal Nation<br/>
<br/>
Two letterboxes on a steep section of the Narragansset Trail in <br/>
Ledyard, CT, at the top of the pure quartz eruption called Lantern <br/>
Hill. From the corner of CT Rte. 2 and Winchetaug Hill Rd, just south <br/>
of the Mashantucket Pequot's Foxwoods Casino, head south on <br/>
Winchetaug Hill for a short way, and park along the road on your <br/>
right at the blue blazed trail.<br/>
<br/>
Hike up a tote road and bear left with the blue blazes at the <br/>
intersection with the Pachaug Trail. Climb some more before jogging <br/>
right with the blazes to climb along a hillside with spectacular <br/>
views north and west.<br/>
<br/>
At the summit there are many overlooks: leave the trail when it turns <br/>
left away from the edge and cut even sharper left, north, along a <br/>
spine of quartz. Pass a fire ring (the site of both ancient and <br/>
modern day Native American ritual) in a smooth grassy area, and <br/>
continue briefly north onto an unmarked trail to an overlook with <br/>
views to the east. Your reward is tucked away from prying eyes in the <br/>
eastern face of the quartz ledge here, just before (south of) a <br/>
gnarly pine tree. From this spot, a pair of communication antennae <br/>
bear at 108 degrees, the Foxwoods casino is seen through the trees at <br/>
330, and a ball-shaped water tower is 265 degrees. <br/>
<br/>
Return to the blue trail and continue westwards across the outcrops <br/>
and view spots. The trail drops steeply off the summit heading south-<br/>
southeast. Stepping down the steep quartz trail, soon come to a less-<br/>
rocky, level spot with an unmarked trail heading left. Turn right to <br/>
240; and bushwack about 20 steps through fire damaged growth to a <br/>
west-northwest facing outcrop of sheer vertical rock. The Fire Empire <br/>
letterbox is tucked into the ground here.<br/>
<br/>
You can return the way you came, or descend here with the trail <br/>
southward to Winchetaug Hill Rd (take a left from there back to your <br/>
car). Now to try your luck at the casino!<br/>

As soon as I get a day off (this next Monday) I'll be planting three more<br/>
