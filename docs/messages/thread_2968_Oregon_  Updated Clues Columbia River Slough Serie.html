been replaced to a safer location close to where it was located before.<br/>
Here is the whole package with Box #2 clues updated. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA RIVER SLOUGH LETTERBOX SERIES<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's time to get excited, folks!  Six more letterboxes have been placed in<br/>
the Portland, Oregon Metropolitan Area.  This time we go to East Multnomah<br/>
County for a wet and wild time!  Please note:  The first four letterboxes of<br/>
this series can only be accessed via a canoe or kayak.  The final two are<br/>
handily located for hikers to seek.  All can be reached from the same<br/>
starting point.  Please dress appropriately for dampness and some definite<br/>
intimate contact with blackberry brambles for boxes 1-4 and 6.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:  From the I-205, Veteran's Memorial Freeway heading North, take<br/>
exit 24B Airport Way East.  If you miss this exit, have a good time in<br/>
Washington and check out Der Mad Stamper's letterbox at Battleground Lake!<br/>
Anyway...Take the 24B, Airport Way East exit.  Continue on that road East<br/>
for three miles.  Shortly after you pass the large pale blue water tank to<br/>
your right you'll make a right turn in the next driveway and then veer left<br/>
to the Columbia Slough Canoe Launch/Trailhead parking.  This is located at<br/>
approximately NE 165th and Airport Way.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>

ON THE WATER<br/>
LETTERBOXES 1 - 4: <br/>
CLUES:  PRETTY EASY, I THINK.  <br/>
DIFFICULTY: MUST USE PADDLECRAFT TO ACCESS. ALSO, DEPENDS ON HOW WELL YOU<br/>
CAN MANEUVER YOUR CRAFT, BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO TOUGH. YOU MIGHT HAVE A<br/>
LITTLE  CONTACT WITH BERRY BRAMBLES AND BUSHES, BUT NOT MUCH.<br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA SLOUGH LETTERBOX 1:  The Simple Fish<br/>
Put your boat in at the canoe launch.  Paddle beneath the bridge and<br/>
continue.  When you reach a large, distinct fork in the waterway, turn<br/>
right.  Keep paddling.  At the next spot where cars go over and you go under<br/>
watch for a culvert on your Port side.  Pass by a cyclone fence post, which<br/>
is also Port side.  On Starboard a small lone standing tree is on the bank.<br/>
Directly across from that on Port side is a stump sticking sideways out of<br/>
the bank.  The simple fish in Letterbox 1 is above it there for you to<br/>
stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA SLOUGH LETTERBOX 2:  The Canoe &amp; Paddle NEW LOCATION.  UPDATED<br/>
7/25/2001<br/>
Keep on going.  After you go under the high bridge, there is a thin cut tree<br/>
sticking out sideways up the bank on the Starboard side.  A few strokes<br/>
ahead of this is a stump near the water.  Behind it the canoe and paddle in<br/>
Letterbox 2 awaits your arrival. <br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA SLOUGH LETTERBOX 3:  The Waterfowl<br/>
You'll paddle underneath the next low bridge.  Just before you get to the<br/>
islands, if you're lucky, nutria might swim by to check you out.  Veer to<br/>
the right of the islands on the main waterway for the rest of your journey.<br/>
Sometimes it may feel as if you're poling more than paddling. The water can<br/>
be shallow in this area, but you will get through. If you choose to go your<br/>
own way, though, you will probably get stuck. Keep paddling past the rocky<br/>
drainage and stay just to the left of that.  You'll probably see plenty of<br/>
ducks here.  You will go under a log with pipes attached and a wire hanging<br/>
down.  Lots of nutria live around here.  You will probably have to duck or<br/>
do the canoe limbo to get beyond this, but please do it.  Once you've passed<br/>
beneath, go 15 strokes, turn your head and look aft.  Letterbox 3 should be<br/>
very obvious from this viewpoint.<br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA SLOUGH LETTERBOX 4:  The Great Blue Heron<br/>
You know, as Vanessa Williams sings, you go and save the best for last.<br/>
Truer words could not be spoken about Letterbox 4.  This is the last<br/>
letterbox you have to access by water and, in my not so humble opinion, it<br/>
is the best.  Go all the way to the end of the slough as far as you can<br/>
paddle.  You'll be under a large concrete pipe and water will probably be<br/>
flowing from the culvert on the North side.  Straight ahead and just above<br/>
is a light green pipe.  A concrete pipe is right behind it.  The Great Blue<br/>
Heron is tucked away in Letterbox 4 between these two pipes near the U<br/>
clamp.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA RIVER SLOUGH LETTERBOX SERIES<br/>
(CONTINUED)<br/>
<br/>
ON THE TRAIL<br/>
<br/>
LETTERBOXES 5 &amp; 6: <br/>
CLUES:  VERY EASY. <br/>
DIFFICULTY: NOT MUCH.  GRAVEL &amp; MULCH PATH. A COUPLE INSTANCES WITH A SMALL<br/>
AMOUNT OF STEPS AND A BRIDGE.  DEFINITE BLACKBERRY ALERT FOR LETTERBOX 6.<br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA SLOUGH LETTERBOX 5:  The Pine Cone<br/>
At the parking lot, follow the trail down to the canoe launch and go under<br/>
the bridge and up the stairs.  Continue on and enjoy the sights and sounds<br/>
of the slough environment (not to mention the more than occasional airport<br/>
traffic).  Keep meandering along.  Soon you will pass by a blue water<br/>
structure on your left, then a picnic area.  There will be a green sign just<br/>
past here on your right that says: "HIKERS ONLY" From this point go down the<br/>
path 33 steps.  On your left will be several trees clumped together, two<br/>
that are kind of broken off.  One of those has a hollow-looking stump.<br/>
Behind these trees the pine cone is nestled in the roots.<br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA SLOUGH LETTERBOX 6:  The Dragonfly<br/>
Once you're over the thrill of discovering the pine cone keep on trucking<br/>
down the trail.  Go over the bridge and keep going.  When you see the beige<br/>
building with teal and gray accents, and four pine trees on the East side<br/>
you are nearly there.  Walk forward.  Just before the bend in the path and<br/>
at the end of the cyclone fence, please look at 8:00 O'Clock.  Do you see<br/>
that wispy-looking tree closest to you?  At the base of this the dragonfly<br/>
can be found, though not without effort. Some blackberry branches will snag<br/>
you in an effort to protect.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Amanda, In your clues you use the words "canoe or kayak", could a <br/>
small dingy make the trip or is the waterway too narrow?<br/>
I have an 8 foot dingy I built to use as a "shore boat" from the <br/>
family boat, and was wondering if it could make the passage.<br/>
