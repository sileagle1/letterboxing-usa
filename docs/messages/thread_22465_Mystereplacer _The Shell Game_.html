Here's the update I promised.<br/>
I went out to check on the box today and the added stamp is really well <br/>
done! I didn't care for my store bought one much any way so was <br/>
thinking of just using Mystereplacer's but then was thinking the shell <br/>
game actually requires 3 shells so I could make another... but they <br/>
should really be identical for the game so maybe I'll go back and <br/>
remove mine and suggest people stamp three times! I think this is <br/>
someone clever - it's not Mystery Placer but replacer and it does say <br/>
their mission is to have a hand carved stamp in every LB and something <br/>
about missing boxes also - maybe replacing any that are missing? I <br/>
think the heading... This little piece of Mischief... makes it light <br/>
hearted though and it doesn't upset me. Like others have indicated it's <br/>
not too big a deal because it's not permanent unless I choose - the <br/>
recipients can always take it back out if they don't want it. In my <br/>
case they just beat me to making a replacement and it is probably much <br/>
nicer than I could have done so I'll accept the offering. Thanks <br/>
Mystereplacer! I am curious as to who you are though - will you send me <br/>
a note? integrityhms@verizon.net<br/>
Well, come on by and check it out everyone!<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
