update to the:<br/>
<br/>
Last Chance Silver Eagle Letterboxing Exchange/Get-together<br/>
<br/>
Despite the threat of impending rain, around 15 exhuberant folks <br/>
braved the liquid sunshine and attended the Silver Eagle LB Exchange <br/>
gathering in Tacoma yesterday.  Many a signature stamp was <br/>
exchanged, several area letterboxes were sought and found and a <br/>
great time was had by all.  Silver Eagle managed to find all <br/>
the 'available' letterboxes in Wapato Park before he had to head off <br/>
to catch his flight back home.  It was a great way to start the <br/>
weekend and, fortunately, the deluges held off for a bit allowing <br/>
many of us to locate the few remaining letterboxes that we hadn't <br/>
yet found in the park.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, everybody, for attending and offering such a warm welcome to <br/>
Silver Eagle during his brief trip to the region.  We look forward <br/>
to future fun gatherings in the area.  If anybody else is headed to <br/>
the region for whatever reason, please let us know and we can <br/>
arrange a similar gettogether if you're interested.  <br/>
<br/>
Have a great letterboxing day!  Of course, we won't be heading out <br/>
anytime soon as it's raining buckets right now (or is that just the <br/>
message we want to convey to everybody else around the world?).  ;)<br/>
