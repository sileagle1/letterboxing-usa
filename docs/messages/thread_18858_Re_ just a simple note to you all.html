 Apology accepted, though I can't call to mind which sarcastic <br/>
comment you are apologizing for. Many are posted.<br/>
   Perhaps you could prevail upon the group to stop with the kitten <br/>
killing comments? This is a family bul. board and it makes me shudder <br/>
to think of a kiddo (hopefully supervised by a parent) reading the <br/>
posts.  I never addressed the issue or cared to know the meaning of <br/>
the slang phrase.  Murder will out as they say, and sure enough the <br/>
coinage was explained. <br/>
