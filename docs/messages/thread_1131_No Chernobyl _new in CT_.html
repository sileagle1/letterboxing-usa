Here are two easy hikes with letterboxes, separated by a short drive <br/>
between, at the Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Station in Haddam, <br/>
CT. These spots are particularly good for birding: we regularly spot <br/>
bald eagles here in the winter and early spring.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From the scenic village of East Haddam near the Goodspeed <br/>
Opera House, follow CT Rte. 149 North for 3.2 miles. Turn left onto <br/>
Rte. 151 North for 4.3 miles, then left again onto Haddam Neck Rd. <br/>
Follow Haddam Neck and the signs for CT Yankee downhill to turn left <br/>
onto Indian Hollow Rd. At the power plant, park in the first lot on <br/>
your right overlooking the Connecticut River.<br/>
<br/>
The Clean Up Letterbox: Walk down to the dock by the visitor's center <br/>
and enjoy the views of the river. There is a nice map of the trails <br/>
here as well. Walk north upstream through the parking lot and a <br/>
picnic ground and watch for a right turn onto the nature trail. This <br/>
quick loop will bring you back to the road: zig zag left-right to <br/>
cross the road beyond the fencing on either side and then head back <br/>
down south along the road, soon letting the path bear left. Find a <br/>
pleasant footbridge over a small pond under a weeping willow and <br/>
cross over.<br/>
<br/>
Walk straight east across the gravel road on the other side and head <br/>
uphill on the Quarry Hill Trail (blue blazes). It climbs a short bit <br/>
then bends right along an old carriage road, with quarry tailings on <br/>
either side, to a forking. Bear right on the marked trail and enjoy <br/>
the steps and a little loop that turns around to the left with a <br/>
lowish wall on the right hand side. Pass #3 and just where that fork <br/>
rejoins from the left, turn right (east) and scramble up the sloping <br/>
wall to hop up the final 3 foot ledge. A step or two farther into the <br/>
rocks brings you to your first reward.<br/>
<br/>
Complete the loop with a baby climb, a quarry road, some beautiful <br/>
mountain laurel, and a seasonal brook. At the trail's end, bear left <br/>
towards the big parking lot, regain the entrance road, and turn right <br/>
to your car.<br/>
<br/>
A short drive between boxes: Now drive 2.4 miles back up the road to <br/>
Quarry Hill Road. Turn right, then left onto Cove Road. It gets <br/>
narrow a bit before you fork right around a power relay station. Pass <br/>
through a gate and drive downhill. Go left at the "T," and drive down <br/>
to the end along the cooling canal.<br/>
<br/>
The Warm Waters Letterbox: Walk out south along the path 100 yards to <br/>
the end and views. Backtracking about 30 steps, cut right (east) 12 <br/>
steps to the letterbox on the ground behind cedar. This is a great <br/>
place for a picnic or a glass of wine!<br/>
