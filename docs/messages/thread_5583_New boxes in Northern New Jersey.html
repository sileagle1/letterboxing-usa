year.  There's been some family problems to attend to.  I'm trying to <br/>
get back on track.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope to be placing two boxes in the next month.  One will be <br/>
a "Paddle by" box in the Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge that <br/>
can only be reached by Canoe.  To make it even more challenging the <br/>
clues will require paddling upstream.  (Not hard on that section of <br/>
the River)<br/>
<br/>
The other will be a box solar box.  The clues will start from the tip <br/>
of the shadow of a structure at a particular day and time.  <br/>
Tentatively it will be at 12 noon on July 4th.  Either you have to be <br/>
there on or around that day and time or you have to purchase an <br/>
ephemorus to give you the sun's position.  <br/>
I'm still formulating it.  <br/>
<br/>
They'll both be in Sussex County NJ.<br/>

I did my first research today for the Solar one.  I think that I'm <br/>
going to make it a mystery box attached to the Stone Needle.  After <br/>
reading the posts regarding public land managers destroying <br/>
letterboxes, I decided it would be better to keep it discreet.  I <br/>
know the Superintendant of the Wildlife refuge personally and will <br/>
have a talk with her before placing it.  <br/>
<br/>
I've already located a good hiding place and have done the math.  I <br/>
think that I'm going to provide clues from the tip of the shadow at 4 <br/>
different times of the year: The Vernal Equinox, the Autumnal <br/>
Equinox, the Summer Solstice and the winter solstice.  With the <br/>
accuracy we need, you would be able to get away with a week either <br/>
way.  However, the time of day is much more important.  A half an <br/>
hour could make a big difference.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll keep you posted.<br/>
