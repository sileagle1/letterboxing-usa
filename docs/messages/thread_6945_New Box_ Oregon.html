                    <div class="plaintext-content">I really wanted to place a box on the top of Broughton's Bluff in <br/>
Troutdale Oregon, and thought I knew how to get to the top, but when <br/>
I went out to hike up there, I realized I didn't know how to get up <br/>
there.  I spent a morning hiking all the trails I could find around <br/>
Lewis and Clark State Park, but none of them got me to the top.  So I <br/>
placed it on one of these trails near the rock climbing walls.<br/>
<br/>
Broughton's Bluff Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead:  Take I-84 east from Portland.  Take the exit <br/>
immediatly afer the Troutdale exit where the outlet malls are at.  I <br/>
can't remember the number, but the sign should say it is the exit for <br/>
Lewis and Clark state park.  Park in the L&amp;C parking lot.  There are <br/>
a couple of trails near eachother that climb into the trees on the <br/>
south end of the park.  Either one of them will get you to where you <br/>
need to go.<br/>
<br/>
To the box:  Head up the trail a little ways until you come across <br/>
the rock-climbing area.  First there will be a rock-climbing wall <br/>
just off the trail to the left.  Keep going past this one.  Then you <br/>
will walk right by another.  Keep going past this one.  The you will <br/>
see a third, obviously less popular wall, which you will pass as <br/>
well.  And finally, walk past the fourth wall you see.  Shortly after <br/>
the fourth wall a log blocks your path.  Just on the other side, you <br/>
will see another log that runs right next to the trail.  The box is <br/>
hidden where this log meets up with a tree.<br/>
