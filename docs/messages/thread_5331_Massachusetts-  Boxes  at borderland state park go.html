 We just went looking for Serenity today and could not find her. We <br/>
did a thorough search, despite the light rain. I felt sure we had <br/>
found the crevasse.<br/>
 We also looked for the Peace fairy, to be found in a hollow tree, <br/>
but were unable to locate that letterbox either.<br/>
  Can anyone confirm whether Peace is missing?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Hi All,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     I am trying to confirm if a box at borderland state park in <br/>
&gt; Sharon MA has gone missing.  I am referring to Serenity fairy of <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; Fairies of Borderland, I attempted the find on December 16, 2001 <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; could not find the box and I am fairly sure I was in the proper <br/>
&gt; location.  Can anyone give some help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks- jojo<br/>

the Quiet Woods trail was VERY hollow and looked like it had been <br/>
burned inside at one point. Maybe 6 feet off the trail? We could look <br/>
inside from both a hole at about 5' 10" and from a hole at the bottom <br/>
facing away from the trail.<br/>
Lots of fallen bark around.<br/>
Oh well, maybe we had the wrong tree.<br/>
