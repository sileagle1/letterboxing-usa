                    <div class="plaintext-content">My sister and I have tried, without success to contact Hangglider<br/>
about a couple of missing boxes here in Spokane. (It has now been many<br/>
weeks since our first email to this boxer.) I have verified the status<br/>
of this box with other boxers in the area, and while it is obvious<br/>
where the box should be, none of us has had any attempt in finding the<br/>
box even though each of us has made several attempts.  I also see that<br/>
this boxer has a missing box in Idaho.<br/>
<br/>
The place for one of these boxes is really quite lovely, and I would<br/>
like to replace at least the box there, altering the clues slightly,<br/>
but giving credit to the original placer.  My question is, how does<br/>
one go about doing that on LbNA?  On Atlas Quest, I think I've figured<br/>
it out, but I'm not sure of the procedure on LbNA.<br/>

Thanks for any and all help!<br/>

I'd like to adopt. The box has been confirmed missing by me (in July 2005) after a couple of boxers asked me to check (I found it in Oct 2004 so I know where it was planted).<br/>
