for this kind of thing.  Unfortunately, that is mostly what I have <br/>
encountered too.  <br/>
<br/>
The most popular type of container seems to be the Lock and Lock.  I <br/>
have found them in the housewares department of Wal-Marts and other <br/>
stores of that type.  They have a seal around the rim and there are <br/>
latches on all four sides.  <br/>
<br/>
A suggestion for those boxes in the Glad containers - carry a <br/>
handful of Ziploc bags and some paper towels with you.  You can dry <br/>
out the box and put an extra layer of protection around the contents.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It is disappointing to find a totally water-laden box.  I agree that <br/>
the lightweight plastic containers just don't do the job.  We use <br/>
the Rubbermaid boxes with the blue gasket around the top, and so far <br/>
(knock wood), our boxes have stayed dry for the most part.  We also <br/>
plan to try the Lock-and-Lock boxes, which seem to work well too.<br/>
<br/>
But even with the best box, the contents can get damp if finders <br/>
don't make sure that the lid is tightly reseated on the box before <br/>
they replant it.  We have come across the Rubbermaid and other boxes <br/>
the the lid only partially pushed down.  So, like many others, we <br/>
double-bag our logbooks, as an added layer of protection.  And we <br/>
also carry extra Ziploc bags and paper towels so we can try to help <br/>
boxes we find that are damp.  Some, sadly, have been beyond <br/>
redemption.<br/>
<br/>
One added note: we have come across boxes that have been placed <br/>
inside a larger plastic bag.  Almost every one we found like that <br/>
had standing water inside the outer plastic bag.  If it gets torn by <br/>
an animal (which seems to happen frequently), water gets in, and <br/>
then can't drain out very well.  Putting the whole box in an outer <br/>
plastic bag seems to make it worse.<br/>
