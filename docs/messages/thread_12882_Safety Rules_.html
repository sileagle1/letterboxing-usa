                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks! These are really good safety rules. Wish more folks would <br/>
observe them, in fact rather than in passing.<br/>
<br/>
I would add: recognize and avoid poison oak, ivy, sumac. Unless you <br/>
have had experience with them, you would not believe the agony, <br/>
irritation and absolute ruination of your life for as much as a month <br/>
they can cause. I am now considering, once again, getting the poison <br/>
oak innoculations to prevent me getting it again. Three shots and you <br/>
are pretty good to go.<br/>
<br/>
JugglerMouse stuck her hands into poison oak and I fortunately found <br/>
mugwort growing nearby. Mugwort has very sticky leaves and can be <br/>
used to quickly (but not reliably) decontaminate the poison oak oils. <br/>
<br/>
Carrying a compass and considering a GPS,<br/>
