Why don't we create a homemade or store-bought bandanna of a specific<br/>
color family optionally with the LbNA logo drawn, stiched, patched, on<br/>
it, or even a version of your personal stamp?<br/>
<br/>
We could wear the bandanna in our pocket, on a belt loop, on our head,<br/>
hanging from our backpack, around our neck...anywhere. <br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>

I laughed so hard during that bit that I can't remember most of the <br/>
walks aside from John Cleese's.  I am so out of shape that if I <br/>
attempted to actually silly walk my way to box I would probably <br/>
collapse.  <br/>
<br/>
I am sensing from recent posts that most of you think the ADG are <br/>
nuts.  I don't know how the rumors got started but rest assured they <br/>
are false.  Sarah, Cat, and I are just your normal, run of the mill, <br/>
middle-aged house fraus who enjoy cribbage, a hot cup of tea, and <br/>
pornographic origami.  We find boxing an endearing hobby because it <br/>
gives us time to stroll through the woods discussing our favorite <br/>
topics: soft cheeses and animal husbandry.  <br/>
