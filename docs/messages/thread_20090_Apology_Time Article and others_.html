I was responding to another post on another chat list(SoCal). I simply screwed up by sending the post to the main chat list. Without the previous message to read, my post seems to read quite differently than it's intention. Sorry I lit a match to a subject  without realizing, then walked away, but we were on the road and today was the first time I have read the messages since 8/22. <br/>
