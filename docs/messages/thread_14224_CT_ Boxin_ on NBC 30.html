                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow... NBC did a nice job with their program last night at 7pm.  The <br/>
program was geared towards educating kids and had features on sailing <br/>
in Mystic, lobstering in Groton, and letterboxing in the CT State <br/>
forests.   Grant Stinchfield hosted the bit on LB and he was walking <br/>
through the forest with the Moshier family (sp?). Not sure which <br/>
forest he was at, but they walked by Nathan Hale's historic <br/>
home...and I think that's in the greater Coventry area?<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, they kept it simple and focused on the State DEP's series of <br/>
boxes. NBC centered on the educational aspects of the hobby and on <br/>
the idea of spending quality family time together!  <br/>
<br/>
Another positive promotion! Yay!<br/>

Once we watch all the ER's and Third Watches that we taped earlier in <br/>
the 'season', it can certainly circulate...<br/>
