mostly in jest when several of our boxes were confiscated by National Park<br/>
Service. Now it us part of our p/f category.  Our son had one picked up too<br/>
as did a fellow boxer on Central Coast-Ca.  It just seemed like a distinct<br/>
way to title a "Lost" box.  We knew who took it as we were notified.  We<br/>
will continue to hide boxes on PUBLIC land with masked clues, Gwen<br/>

Can I say Ditto?!?<br/>
I agree with Don and Gwen, having had my boxes conviscated and kept <br/>
as evidence against me! :-) <br/>
But my C count is not that big...Not as big as my stealth box count!<br/>
