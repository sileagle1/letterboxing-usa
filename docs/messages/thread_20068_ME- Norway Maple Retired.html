in Wells, Maine has been retired. Clues on the site will change to <br/>

inside. Thanks to the last brave rescue by Beswick using BBQ tongs and <br/>
the fact that the tree I was eying to replant it in was struck by <br/>
lightning in Friday's storm, I've decided it was time to pull it. Thanks <br/>

though, we'll eventually get around to planting some of the others we've <br/>
carved that are sitting around here waiting for homes. Probably not at <br/>
the Reserve though.<br/>
Hmmmm....Or perhaps if you were to visit the mystery Home Sweet Home <br/>
this Sunday you might find a certain tree-themed HH? Methinks I should <br/>
perhaps get to work on a logbook!<br/>
