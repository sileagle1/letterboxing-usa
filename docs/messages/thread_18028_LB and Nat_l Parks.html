Dicknoone makes my point here; National parks in my area and all <br/>
over the country allow activities that have far more impact on the <br/>
parks than our Tupperware. Many parks allow hunting, recreational <br/>
vehicle traffic, camping, hiking, skiing, biking, rock climbing,  <br/>
logging, and oil drilling! Yes I'm sure balancing many demands is <br/>
difficult but a blanket exclusion of letterboxing while allowing <br/>
logging and oil drilling hardly seems like a considered and well <br/>
reasoned ruling (and, I'm sorry, is dismissive and smacks of <br/>
apathetic disregard). Furthermore, I'll save the high-minded <br/>
rhetoric for the united front of course, but I think we need a <br/>
little rabble rousing and frustration venting to stir the rank and <br/>
file into action.<br/>
