My Girl Scout Troop wants to find these letterboxes when they are out <br/>
of school next week.  Can anyone tell me if they are still there or <br/>
should we go elsewhere and not take up the time.  They were placed <br/>
quite awhile ago.  We will have a girl new to letterboxing with us <br/>
and don't want to disappoint her on the first try.  Thank-you.<br/>
