&gt;  Hi, I just found out about this hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome Mick!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Does anybody know if there are problems with<br/>
&gt;  placing boxes in a National Park? I don't see where it would be any<br/>
&gt;  more of a liablity to the park than a normal hike and if it's well<br/>
&gt;  hidden it wouldn't detract from the natural beauty of the place.<br/>
<br/>
We were discussing this very subject yesterday at some length.  The<br/>
general consensus seems to be the familiar don't ask/don't tell policy. <br/>
We don't ask... they don't tell us we can't!!  Seriously, if you use<br/>
good judgement in placing your letterboxes (hiding them in locations<br/>
that are not hazardous to the Park environment), there is really nothing<br/>
to complain about.  Most of these boxes will never be found other than<br/>
by those who are looking for them via the clues anyway!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  About<br/>
&gt;  how long does it take to get a stamp made?<br/>
<br/>
It depends on the carver!  At least one of our group takes the naked<br/>
eraser or carving medium right on-site and carves "plenn aire."  Your<br/>
own individual style and ability will dictate how long it takes.  For a<br/>
first effort, figure it will take you an easy evening to assemble a box,<br/>
carving included (...again, this is my estimate... your mileage may<br/>
vary).  The ultimate time saver would be to go to the craft store and<br/>
buy a premade stamp.<br/>
<br/>
We will expect a full report from your hike and first box!<br/>

About putting boxes in U.S. national parks: You might want to take the precaution of not leaving any information in the box that would identify you. I'd expect national park authorities to be more strict than those in national forests. And I'd expect trouble if your box were found by the rangers. The ethic in national parks is pretty rigidly preservationist; the orientation is toward control. (My wife does microbial research in Yellowstone, so we've run into some of this -- just yesterday in fact when, despite having all the proper permits, the research crew was confronted and its work was mildly disrupted by a too-careful ranger.) Anyway, while this takes some of the fun out of letterboxing, a letterbox placed in a national park would be no place for self-promotion. My 'umble opinion.<br/>
<br/>
One alternative would be to stash the box in a particularly attractive, but overlooked area of national forest outside the park. Most national parks have a buffer of other public land around them. Probably no less illegal, but less likely to provoke an investigation.<br/>
<br/>
About getting stamps made: If you're not an artsy-craftsy person you can get a custom rubber stamp made up at an upscale stamp shop (computer-equipped) for around $10-15. It takes a day or two for them to scan the artwork you provide and then cut and mount the stamp -- maybe a little longer if it's a busy shop; maybe a lot longer if they're not service oriented.<br/>
<br/>
I gather the aesthetic among most of the active participants on this list leans toward hand-carved stamps. I'm leaning that way myself, but in order to jump-start letterboxing in Montana I asked a friend to create some designs on paper (computer, really) and then had five stamps made up commercially. <br/>
<br/>
I did a lot of modestly successful linoleum block carving back in the early '70s, so I have the tools and the skills (both rusty) to carve stamps, but I have been frustrated by my first couple botched attempts at carving erasers. (I know, I know; "just keep trying." I will!) <br/>
<br/>
If you're in a hurry to get into letterboxing, I'd suggest there's little or no shame in having at least your first few stamps made up commercially.<br/>

Hi Mick,<br/>
<br/>
How exciting! Letterboxes in Yosemite! It's my all-time favorite place to be so you can count on me to visit your boxes!<br/>
<br/>
I'm in the Bay Area where there are a few boxes hidden. It'll be great to have more activity in our state.<br/>

I love Yosemite and hope to be up that way sometime in October (A friend of<br/>
mine has a cabin up in North Fork).  Depending on the difficulty of the hike<br/>
(I am VERY out of shape) I'll be hunting any boxes that you might leave in<br/>
the area.<br/>
<br/>
If you make it down to the Southern part of the state let me know.  I have a<br/>
few boxes hinden down here (South Bay, that is Santa Monica Bay).<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to some really cool fun!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry I've been behind in thanking the many people who have visited, <br/>
maintained, restocked, and even saved our letterboxes from floods! <br/>
It's been wonderful following the growth of letterboxing and the <br/>
spring season energy everyone has. So many creative new letterboxes <br/>
to look for!<br/>
<br/>
We had a chance to visit my beloved home in northern California and <br/>
have a couple of letterboxes called "Wine Country" for your enjoyment <br/>
in Sonoma County:<br/>

Finally, congratulations to Der Mad Stamper for placing his 50th <br/>
(!!!) letterbox, and to the wonderful folks in the pacific northwest <br/>
who have done so much to promote the sport with their <br/>
recent "gathering."<br/>

Jay in lovely spring cycling weather CT<br/>
