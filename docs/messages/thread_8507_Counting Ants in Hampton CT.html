<div><span class="610114522-19102002">Chickabirdie, Molly 
and myself did the 10 ant boxes yesterday Hampton CT yesterday. I'm glad you 
changed it so that each box is a find. It took some work to get them. The rating 
of moderate is correct. They are not easy but are findable with a bit of work. 
Had trouble with # 8 but we did get all 10. For the time spent trying to find 
them, I'm sure glad it counted for 10. A few of them were tough and took some 
time to find. First timeÂ hunting for such small containers. It was 
different. Nice hike. Think more people should try it. You can skip one and go 
to the next if you have to......Chuck</span></div></body></html>
