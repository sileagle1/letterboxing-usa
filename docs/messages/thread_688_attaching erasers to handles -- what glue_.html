I'm going to hand-carve the next stamps I need for letterboxes. Not having<br/>
done this before "in the field" I need to know what supplies to take with<br/>
me to my destination. I've got everything figured out, I think, except what<br/>
glue to use to fasten the eraser to the wooden handle.<br/>
<br/>
I checked Der Mad Stamper's page, linked to the LBNA page. He recommends<br/>
rubber cement. The location where I will be placing my next letterbox is<br/>
probably the epitome of harsh conditions: extreme temperature range, very<br/>
low humidity, etc. I guess my question is whether rubber cement will hold<br/>
up if the temperature in the box exceeds 140 degrees F. (assuming the BOX<br/>
holds up!).<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone used other glues? I'm thinking of Barge Cement and of "Goop" --<br/>
both of which come in tubes I can take with me on this trip -- but have no<br/>
experience with either in the realm of the wood/eraser interface. This will<br/>
be an "orphan" box; I will probably never see it again after placing it. So<br/>
I need to be sure the stamp will stay intact.<br/>
<br/>
I'd appreciate any and all advice.<br/>

<br/>
Attaching dissimilar materials is really a pain.  I have had some<br/>
success with "Goop" products.  Some silicone based adhesives will work<br/>
as well.  I found good old construction adhesive (sold up here under the<br/>
name "Liquid Nails") in a small, resealable tube condusive to packing in<br/>
and out &amp; not much weight.  It seems to stick to most anything and is<br/>
good for exterior applications.  I have had better luck with it than the<br/>
various forms of "Goop" that I have tried.<br/>
<br/>
Epoxy might actually be the best bet.  Unfortunately, I don't have a<br/>
type or brand to recommend.  Go to Home Depot... read some labels!<br/>
<br/>
good luck!<br/>

I used rubber cement on my first (Prayer Rock) - coat each surface (wood<br/>
and eraser), let it dry thoroughly (couple of minutes) carefully<br/>
position and press together.  Slapping together wet will leave a<br/>
removable bond (good for some things, but not what you want here). This<br/>
has held up fine, altho nowhere near the temperature extreems that you<br/>
describe! All others have been with Factis erasers - thick enough not to<br/>
need a backer board, altho it would be an improvement (clean fingers,<br/>
etc).<br/>
<br/>
I think the key to survival is whether or not the glue stays flexible<br/>
over the long term - dissimilar materials usually have different<br/>
coefficients of thermal expansion, so, with a wide temperature swing,<br/>
they tend to work apart if the cement is not flexible enough to absorbe<br/>
the movement.<br/>
<br/>
Contact cement (stuff in a can for laying floor tiles, plastic laminate<br/>
countertops, etc) is designed for this - nearly 3 decades ago, I<br/>
lathe-turned a bowl, using mahogany and aluminum, and first assembled<br/>
the blanks with "Weldwood" contact cement - worked like a charm over<br/>
this long span. My gut feeling is that the barge cement and Goop will do<br/>
just fine - read the temperature range on the tube too see if it is<br/>
appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I like the idea of a wood blank, so one can stamp the blank first,<br/>
and then assemble - helps with getting the impression where you want it.<br/>
<br/>
BTW (2) - I've just found a free supply of wood perfect for blanks -<br/>
about 3/8" thick, smooth poplar, offcuts from a local wood products<br/>
business. I'm willing to make a few blanks (gratis) if anyone would like<br/>
to try them and has no other good source. Let me know off-line if you'd<br/>
like to do this (either tell me the size, or send a stamp impression for<br/>
me to match).<br/>
<br/>
Mark - let us know what you try. <br/>

&gt;Hi , I'm totally new to letterboxing but not new to glue. I would recommend<br/>
&gt;Formica laminate glue.<br/>
<br/>
Great idea! I've been using contact cement, but I'm not thrilled with the<br/>
adhesion. I'm concerned that it won't hold over time and weather. I will go<br/>
to Home Depot and get some for my next stamp!<br/>

There are some great boxes in Conn. We found some this summer (our first<br/>

Hi , I'm totally new to letterboxing but not new to glue. I would recommend <br/>
Formica laminate glue. It is applied with a brush or roller to both pieces, <br/>
allowed to dry (till tacky) then both pieces are put together and pressed or <br/>
rolled out to remove any air bubbles. Once the two parts are together good <br/>
luck getting them apart so be sure they are lined up where you want them <br/>
before you let them touch. If it is a large or oddly shaped piece you can <br/>
use waxed paper between them to get them aligned and then fold up one side <br/>
,remove the waxed paper from one side and let one half of the two pieces <br/>
touch then fold up the other side , remove the paper and finish the job. I <br/>
will admit to not having performed this with these two materials but it <br/>
should work great ! Incidentally- now you can relaminate your countertops! <br/>

One side goes on the stamp and one side on the would.  Many stampers buy<br/>
unmounted stamps and use the mounting foam to finish the job of mounting the<br/>
stamp to the wood or acrylic mount.<br/>
<br/>
You may even be able to buy this product on the internet.  Search "Rubber<br/>

&gt;   low humidity, etc. I guess my question is whether rubber cement will<br/>
&gt;hold<br/>
&gt;   up if the temperature in the box exceeds 140 degrees F. (assuming the<br/>
&gt;BOX<br/>
&gt;   holds up!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Has anyone used other glues? I'm thinking of Barge Cement and of "Goop"<br/>
&gt;--<br/>
&gt;   both of which come in tubes I can take with me on this trip -- but have<br/>
&gt;no<br/>
&gt;   experience with either in the realm of the wood/eraser interface. This<br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt;   be an "orphan" box; I will probably never see it again after placing it.<br/>
&gt;So<br/>
&gt;   I need to be sure the stamp will stay intact.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I'd appreciate any and all advice.<br/>

great ones. He's right! At www.letterboxing.org just click on CT on the US<br/>
map and you'll find plenty of clues (all in southeastern CT so far), thanks<br/>
to the northeast webmaster Tom Cooch. Or, swing by the EMS store in the<br/>
Crystal Mall in Waterford. They have a great little binder with 20 or so<br/>
cluesheets all ready to go. Let us know what you find!<br/>

&gt;My daughter and I would like some clues to boxes in CT. We're going to get <br/>
&gt;started by trying to find one ! Hope this was helpful.                       <br/>
