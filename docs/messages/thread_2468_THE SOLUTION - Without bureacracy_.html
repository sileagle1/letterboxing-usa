proposing should be a snap for the webmaster and no inconvenience for <br/>
the rest of us.  Simply arrange for the general disclaimer to come up <br/>
when a person presses any links that lead to the main clues map. In <br/>
order to get to the clues, the person has to press a button that in <br/>
effect says, "Yes, I have read the disclaimer and understand my <br/>
responsibilities."  <br/>
<br/>
Even if we don't keep a database, that's enough to scare anyone away <br/>
who doesn't have enough common sense to take care of themselves.  Not <br/>
only does it guarantee that people will have the disclaimer in front <br/>
of them,(even if they don't read it) but it saves the placers the <br/>
trouble of writing "War and Peace" everytime they make a placement.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who complains can simply be told that there's no possible way <br/>
that you could have gotten to those clues without seeing the warnings.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this puts an end to it.<br/>

&gt; Judging from the EXCELLENT website that letterboxing has, what I'm<br/>
&gt; proposing should be a snap for the webmaster and no inconvenience for<br/>
&gt; the rest of us.  Simply arrange for the general disclaimer to come up<br/>
&gt; when a person presses any links that lead to the main clues map. In<br/>
&gt; order to get to the clues, the person has to press a button <br/>
<br/>
I was an LbNA webmaster for a long time so perhaps I can speak with <br/>
some insight.<br/>
<br/>
Many, if not most, of the letterbox clues reachable from the LbNA pages<br/>
are not stored on the LbNA server, but on the personal web pages of<br/>
the people who wrote them, in the list archive, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My clues (as are Todd's), are an example of this.  In analyzing the<br/>
hit logs to my clues, I find that more hits come from the search engines<br/>
than from the links on the LbNA server.  This means that most of the<br/>
eyeballs that see my clues do not even see the LbNA server, and thus<br/>
would miss this popup.<br/>
<br/>
Even if the webmasters force everyone to see such a popup, I do not <br/>
feel that it is a tenable argument that a popup disclaimer would <br/>
prevent someone from going out inappropriately, when the actual <br/>
field conditions in question would not.<br/>
<br/>
In order to close this thread down, I will point out that we do have<br/>
a solution.  One individual on the list spotted something they didn't<br/>
like about someone else's clues.  They said so, and the writer of <br/>
the clues, though in no way obliged to, thought about it and perhaps <br/>
decided the suggestion had merit, and chose to modify their clues.  <br/>
<br/>
Is that not a solution we can all live with?<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Randy<br/>
