fascinated by this similar hobby.  I made several<br/>
stamps today.  Here is my first box, call me<br/>
Flyfisher:<br/>
<br/>
Little Miami Respite<br/>
Beavercreek, Greene County, OH<br/>
Difficulty: Moderate to Easy<br/>
Distance: 0.5 miles round trip<br/>
placed stamp 13 November 2001<br/>
<br/>
Greene County hosts a park where it sounds like only<br/>
skinny people need apply.  This park has nice hiking<br/>
trails and great fishing in the riffles of the Little<br/>
Miami River.  A flyfisherman like myself needs to take<br/>
care not to get the line caught up in the trees that<br/>
crowd both banks.<br/>
<br/>
For this letterbox, park in the designed area near the<br/>
river.  Summer weekends find a continual stream of<br/>
canoe pleasure boaters putting in at this spot.  There<br/>
is a trail that leaves the parking area promising a<br/>
beautiful view.  Take that trail up the hill and<br/>
meander generally south until you reach the 3rd rustic<br/>
park bench.  Have a seat, you deserve it!<br/>
<br/>
In front of you is a gravel path.  Start down that<br/>
path counting by decade and when you reach the century<br/>
mark wriggle 15 paces to the left.  Behind a great oak<br/>
you will find the letterbox which also serves as a<br/>
geocache which can be arrived at with another set of<br/>
instructions.  A letterboxing stamp and log book are<br/>
there.  You will need to supply your own inkpad.<br/>
<br/>
On your return, you can continue down the path and<br/>
enjoy the river views.  Take note of the trees which<br/>
have been felled by the beavers of Beavercreek.<br/>
