Just to clear up something. The Regional Water Authority [New Haven] <br/>
does as you said, have wonderful property for hiking ,some biking and <br/>
other activities. The cost is $25.00 individual permit which give you a <br/>
guest pass usable over the whole year [over and over, no limit of times <br/>
used ]. Family is $35.00 and  Seniors is $20.00  , both also with guest <br/>
passes good for one year. There are some letterboxes already about, nice <br/>
stamps and beautifully written clues. More boxes are in the works, and I <br/>
have been given permission to plant also. Life is good! We will have <br/>
some info. about the Regional Water Authority at the Oct. Kids Day at <br/>
Rocky Neck . Sat. Oct  19th and Sunday Oct. 20 beginning at l0:00 am. <br/>
More about that later.  A letterboxing tired Butterfly.!<br/>
