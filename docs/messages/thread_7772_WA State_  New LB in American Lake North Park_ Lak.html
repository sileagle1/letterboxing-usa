American Lake North Park &amp; Marina	<br/>
Lakewood (8 miles S of Tacoma)<br/>
Pierce County<br/>
Washington<br/>
<br/>
Level of difficulty: Easy SHORT, SHORT, SHORT walk.  Clues <br/>
moderate.  The only thing that will get a workout during the hunt <br/>
for this letterbox will be your brain &amp; perhaps your eyes!  Handicap <br/>
accessible although the box itself might be difficult to retrieve <br/>
without assistance.<br/>
<br/>
Setting:  American Lake North Park &amp; Marina is a gorgeous little <br/>
park on the shore of idyllic American Lake.  It is co-located with <br/>
the only full service seaplane base between Seattle &amp; Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
Highlights:   On a clear day, the park affords an incredible view of <br/>
Mt Rainier.  Bring your binoculars to view an Eagle's aerie on a <br/>
spired tree near North Shore.  Across the lake is the gorgeous <br/>
32,000 sq ft Thornewood Castle built in 1909-1911.<br/>
<br/>
Facilities: A restroom is located at the parking lot. Bring a picnic <br/>
lunch and enjoy it after you find the letterbox.  There is a nice <br/>
beach and a playground, too!<br/>
<br/>
Restrictions:  No elephants or martians.  You can bring your boat or <br/>
your seaplane if you like.<br/>
<br/>
Length of trek:  About 1/32 of a mile (perhaps even shorter than <br/>
that).<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Take I-5 to Exit #124 (Gravelly Lake Dr), head North <br/>
(although you'll be on the West side of I-5) and get into the<br/>
left hand lane.  After 1.2 miles, turn left (West) on Veterans Dr <br/>
SW.  Drive 1.1 miles, the road will curve to the right near the park <br/>
entrance creating a `Y'.  Veer to the left on Vernon Ave SW<br/>
for 0.1 miles.  Follow the sign to American Lake North Park <br/>
entrance.  Turn Right into the driveway and park.  Cost: Free.  <br/>
Start your trek at the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Seaplane Letterbox:  <br/>
<br/>
Away to the southwestern seat of the `dinner table' you<br/>
`slide', spot the nautical base for a seaplane ride.  Across<br/>
the <br/>
water, an eagle's aerie and Thornewood Castle doth hide.  Still <br/>
seated, find the 2 from 1 oak not far from the feast table's lake <br/>
side.  Look through its window to find what you eye'd, for at its <br/>
base a little plane in a box under rocks does reside.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE hide me well when you're through.  This<br/>
park is well manicured and a playground for many!!!  Ensure that <br/>
your camouflage will survive through a strong storm or a curious 3 <br/>
year old should either ever pass through.<br/>
