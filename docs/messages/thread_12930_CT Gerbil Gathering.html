    Thanks should go out to you and your crew. You all pulled off a very<br/>
special day [May the Gerbil rest in peace!] and all of the planning<br/>
really paid off. Your comment is so true about people you have never met<br/>
and feeling like family!! This is a terrific community of people. Sue<br/>
and I had a terrific time - renewing some old friendships and creating<br/>
many new ones. The group boxing really adds a new dimension to the<br/>
hobby!<br/>
<br/>
    Besides the "table o' hitchhikers," the wonderful event stamp, the<br/>
terrific Presidents, Mystery, Birthday and Red Sky Letterboxes, Sue &amp; I<br/>
found some [6] special stamps that I will post later when I get a chance<br/>
to update our website. Brian [TeamGreenDragon]eat your heart out - wait<br/>
until you see what we found!! That will teach you to run off to "Dancing<br/>
Men"!! <br/>
<br/>
    Beth - Hope we didn't keep you waiting in the parking lot too long<br/>
for us to finish the Presidents. Looking forward to the next 31! In<br/>
fact, email me when you carve the next 5 and I will be glad to research<br/>
and email you the info on each of the presidents.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks again one and all for a most memorable day.<br/>
<br/>
