<br/>
I want to remind or let you know that our badge orders are filled by a very <br/>
considerate non letterboxer who does this for us on the side.<br/>
<br/>
She charges very little for her time (compared to other embroidery shops) and <br/>
does great work.<br/>
<br/>
Just like the rest of us, she makes an occasional mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Please show her what a great bunch of people we Letterboxers are and be <br/>
patient in the face of one of those mistakes.  If you are kind and polite, I'm sure <br/>
she will make it right - even if you are rude and nasty, I'm sure she'll make <br/>
it right.<br/>
<br/>
:oP<br/>
<br/>
We actually lost our first embroiderer because of two very mean spirited LBNA <br/>
patch orderers. I'm sure they weren't actually letterboxers just grandparents <br/>
ordering a patch for their letterboxing grandkids. :o)<br/>
<br/>
ANYway - follow the Golden Rule when ordering badges please.<br/>
<br/>
If you've never ordered a badge before  there is a link on the LBNA main <br/>
page.<br/>
<br/>
THANKS  &amp; HAPPY HUNTING,<br/>
