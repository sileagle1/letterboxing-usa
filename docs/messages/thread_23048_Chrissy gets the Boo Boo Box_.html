Hi - I think there has been some confusion. Chrissy/aka Brandy You're <br/>
A Fine Girl, from Connecticut, is the person I was referring to as <br/>
being eligible for the Boo Boo Box.<br/>
<br/>
Also, just as a word to the wise, I had asked her to *email* me the <br/>
information, because you really really don't want to post your "real" <br/>
information on a public forum.<br/>
<br/>
I snipped your "real" information out of this reply.<br/>
<br/>
To be smart, I would suggest that you delete your post.  You really <br/>
REALLY don't want that information in a public forum.<br/>
<br/>
And, for the future, if you actually *do* have an incident while <br/>
letterboxing and feel you are eligible, drop me a line!<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

Hi - I think there has been a bit of confusion.  I posted that <br/>
Chrissy/aka Brandy You're a Fine Girl was eligible for the Boo Boo <br/>
Box because of her eye injury while letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Can I offer a bit of advice?<br/>
<br/>
When I asked Chrissy for her information, I asked her to send it to <br/>
via private email.  As a rule of thumb, posting personal information <br/>
on a public forum is not a good idea.  As you can see from my reply <br/>
to you here, I have deleted your personal information that you posted.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that you delete your post so as to remove your <br/>
personal private information from this public forum.<br/>
<br/>
Just trying to be helpful,<br/>
