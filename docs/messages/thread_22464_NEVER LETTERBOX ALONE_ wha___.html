<br/>
dont letterbox alone. dont hike alone. dont walk<br/>
alone. dont drive alone. lock your doors when driving.<br/>
dont go to the bathroom in public places alone. follow<br/>
your children to the bus stop. ride the school bus<br/>
with them to make sure the driver isnt wierd. dont let<br/>
the children out alone. dont breathe alone. hide in<br/>
your airconditioned condo and wait for the end, but<br/>
dont do it alone.... wait, what was that? <br/>
<br/>
the last hundred years has hosted a population boom<br/>
which of course has increased the number of wierdos<br/>
preying on the innocent. we dont know how the<br/>
percentages fall out, because in the past these things<br/>
simply werent discussed unless it was murder. the up<br/>
side is we have alot better medical and technological<br/>
services. more people equals more stuff across the<br/>
board. <br/>
<br/>
the bottom line is, be aware and prepared. Be aware of<br/>
your surroundings. If someone looks or acts  wierd,<br/>
dont isolate yourself with them. Cautiously move into<br/>
a populated or otherwise safe area. Pay attention to<br/>
your surroundings to the point of paranoia but have<br/>
your good time while paying attention. You can do<br/>
both. Trust me. Be prepared. take the drinks you need,<br/>
make sure the phone is charged. If you dont have a<br/>
cellphone (i thought they were foreign a year ago) get<br/>
a park map in advance to locate the pay phones. i<br/>
think 911 is still free in the counties that support<br/>
it. carry a whistle, one of those rated to carry a far<br/>
distance. but most importantly, be aware of your<br/>
surroundings. <br/>
<br/>
my hubby didnt flip out on me going alone until those<br/>
wierdos starting shooting in richmond. which made no<br/>
sense to me, they were picking very highly populated<br/>
areas. but none the less.... <br/>
<br/>
planning is a must. set a check in time. give a<br/>
location to someone who will notice your absence along<br/>
with that check in time. if you are driving you can<br/>
find a payphone to check in. trust me, they still<br/>
exist. even if the cell phone is dead. <br/>
<br/>
bottom line is, ive decided, if its your time, its<br/>
your time. but good judgement can postpone your time.<br/>
the better judgments you make, the more time you get.<br/>
and sometimes its just chance.  <br/>
<br/>
just be aware. i hope this can help someone. <br/>

It started out as a teenager just as a "game" I'd play, to see if I could<br/>

I don't leave a copy of the LB clues in my truck at all, because if someone<br/>
up to no good breaks into the truck, they'll know where I'm headed.  But I<br/>
do leave a copy setting out by my computer at home, along with the probably<br/>
routes I'm going to be taking from box to box if I'm doing multiple boxes.<br/>
That's not foolproof, I can always change plans once I'm out there, but my<br/>

The great thing about that is that if a person *does* change plans, they can<br/>

do leave a copy setting out by my computer at home, along with the probably<br/>
routes I'm going to be taking from box to box if I'm doing multiple boxes.<br/>
That's not foolproof, I can always change plans once I'm out there, but my<br/>
family, friends, neighbors, have *some* idea where to begin looking.<br/>

&gt; All great points. Letting people know where you're going is a must.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since I do a lot of travelling alone, both boxing and non-boxing, my <br/>
&gt; family<br/>
&gt; also knows that I always put gas in the tank in exact dollars, no <br/>

You may want to pre-pay with the attendant if you are going to start<br/>
this ritual.  It takes a special talent to do this consistently at the<br/>
pump.  I gave up trying to do it long ago.<br/>
