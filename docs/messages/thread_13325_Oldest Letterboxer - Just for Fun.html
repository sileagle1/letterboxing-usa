Actually, Butterfly is still going strong at the age of 72 (?).  There have <br/>
been many a days when she's worn me out boxing!  However, I feel that age is <br/>
how you feel, not just a #.  I think Butterfly is about 35 in "feel age"!<br/>

Now that I am healing from my eye surgery and seeing with two eyes<br/>
again, how about a nice all day hike ?? I have some good ones hanging in<br/>
the back closet. I am just waiting till you and Bluebird and Leader of<br/>
the Pack and other school teaching friends get out for the summer. "Box<br/>
till we drop" will be the marching song.<br/>
Rest up !! And thanks for the morning smile.<br/>
