F, P, and X...or bother with a bunch of little details so here's what <br/>
I think:<br/>
<br/>
I count Founds as all finds made the first time. I count Events in <br/>
with Founds (I found it...on the table) but I've only been to two <br/>
events, so it's not like it really throws the count much. I count <br/>
found hitchhikers here too -- which may have been what you found when <br/>
you happened on a box with two sets of stamps &amp; logbooks. Regular box <br/>
maintenance or checking in on other's boxes when I'm in the area which <br/>
I visited before, don't count.<br/>
<br/>
Placed are boxes my DH &amp; I made and planted. I count hitchhikers we've <br/>
launched with these. BUT, if you need to replace a lost box, and you <br/>
change it's location etc. then I think it's allowable to add that as a <br/>
new placed. You are going through all the same efforts as placing a <br/>
new box, go ahead and count it. On the other hand if you need to <br/>
replace a box and you put it back exactly where it was, then you're <br/>
reusing old clues, stones, etc, that's only a half-effort, don't count <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Exchanged are those which are other people's personal stamps.<br/>
<br/>
It's not like you reach god status when you reach a certain number, <br/>
and 1 or 2 this way or that isn't going to put you in prison. Count <br/>
however you think is right and don't sweat it.<br/>
