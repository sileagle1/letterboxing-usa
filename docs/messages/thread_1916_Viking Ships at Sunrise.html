<div>This letterbox on top of Pattasquamcutt Rock was there on January 06. It is 
very difficult to locate under that rock. I would recommend a hiking staff to 
root it out.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a very funny story to share. I had contacted the placer of<br/>
Viking Ships at Sunrise (RI) that yet again the box had gone missing<br/>
(this was the second time). She was kind enough to recarve another<br/>
stamp and create another book, and I offered to plant it for her (I<br/>
live right nearby). This would be box # 3.<br/>
<br/>
I had guests over for the weekend, and had planned on planting the<br/>
new replacement box on Saturday. Saturday turned out to be an<br/>
extremely windy day, and I was skittish about going out into such<br/>
high winds because I had recently had a large tree branch come down<br/>
in a windstorm that nailed my husband's truck pretty bad. If the<br/>
children had been in the driveway waiting for the bus, they would<br/>
have been killed. So now I'm skittish about winds.<br/>
<br/>
My guests were also letterboxers (Mary RI and Safari Dan), and they<br/>
knew where to plant the letterbox (we had all found it before), so <br/>
they felt game to replant it for me.<br/>
<br/>
They came back about a half hour later.<br/>
<br/>
Safari Dan wanted to make sure that the new box would be secure, so<br/>
without going into details about its location, by using a flashlight<br/>
in broad daylight, Safari Dan was about to place the new Viking Ships<br/>
at Sunrise - and there was the # 2 replacement box, dropped into a<br/>
little crevice. Further searching turned up The Original Box #1!!!<br/>
<br/>
They came back to my house with all 3 of the same letterbox! We even<br/>
took a picture. We have asked the box owner for permission to<br/>
publish the photograph.<br/>
<br/>
After going through the logs, we determined that perhaps two HHs are<br/>
also "lost" in there - Palantir and Traveler with a Twist. We plan<br/>
to go back and dig around some more.<br/>
<br/>
Viking Ships at Sunrise in RI has been replanted 11/29/03. That is to <br/>
say, replacement box #3 was planted, and boxes #1 and #2 are on their <br/>
way back to the placer.<br/>
<br/>
Lesson learned - "not found" doesn't necessarily mean "gone" ;-)<br/>
