Merrill Creek Environmental Preserve<br/>
Warren County, Washington,N.J.<br/>
<br/>
Planted Sept. 29th 2001<br/>
<br/>
Directions:From Phillipsburg N.J., Rt. 57 East to left on Montana Road, <br/>
after 2 miles bear left at "Y" intersection, .3 miles make left on Merrill <br/>
Creek Rd., then turn right towards the Merrill Creek Visitors Center parking <br/>
lot.<br/>
<br/>
Rated: Moderate. This is a six mile circuit hike that starts at the Visitor <br/>
Center.<br/>
<br/>
Time: 3-4 hours. Depends on how often you stop to "look and see". Stamp into <br/>
the "Merrill Creek" letterbox as you begin the circuit. I saw the pair of <br/>
Bald Eagles who call this Preserve home myself the day we were there!!! A <br/>
awesome sight!<br/>
<br/>
Stop in the Center and get a map if you'd like. Nice folk's inside. Find the <br/>
Blue trail and head out. This trail follows the reservoir shoreline <br/>
throughout much of the Preserve. An excellent trail. Pick up the Perimeter <br/>
Trail (Black), there are a few rocky spots but not many. Over the foot <br/>
bridge you go and then over the top of the 1st "gravel" dam. A "point" of <br/>
trees ahead of you on the right, continue up the hill to the "apex" of the <br/>
dirt road. You can see the Inlet/Outlet Tower on the left and ahead of you <br/>
something much better....<br/>
Before the gravel begins, stand, 12 paces at 60 degrees to a rock cairn <br/>
right behind the "point". Bring the box back to the dirt road and sit down <br/>
and stamp in. Please replace the box in it's home carefully when done....<br/>
If you are better than lucky, and the weather permits, this "apex" is where <br/>
you catch your heart in your hand...."Oh! Beautiful for spacious sky's.."<br/>
A view to live for.<br/>
