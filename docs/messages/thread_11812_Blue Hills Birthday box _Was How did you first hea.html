Glad to know the box is still there. Maddie's birthday is coming up <br/>
and we are planning on checking the box then!<br/>
Can't wait to see your team's new set of boxes!<br/>

&gt; Hi CaveyLover People,<br/>
&gt; We found the BlueHills Birthday box on Sunday.<br/>
&gt; We didn't realize it was planted by you til we got there.<br/>
&gt; We are hoping to get a series of 8 boxes out into the <br/>
&gt; Blue Hills this weekend. Brian has spent countless hours<br/>
&gt; carving and stamping and planning and buying rubbermaid boxes.<br/>
&gt; I've become a "carving widow" - but that's ok.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was searching on the internet for a picture of Hancock Hill (at <br/>
&gt; &gt; Blue Hills, MA) for a birthday party invitation and found a link <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; a letterbox there (an later learned it was missing).<br/>
