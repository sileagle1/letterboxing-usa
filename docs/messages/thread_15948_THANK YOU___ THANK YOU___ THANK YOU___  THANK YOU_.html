Did that express it well enough?  I have been checking my mailbox regularly<br/>
just hoping for one of the snail mail boxes.  I have been frustrated to hear<br/>
that it was going to random addresses when I was one of the earliest<br/>
responders and hoped to receive it early.  I didn't think about the fun of<br/>
receiving it after it had more stamps in it.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry it took me a bit to respond.  I have been out of town at a training<br/>
seminar up in Ogden Canyon.  I managed to plant another box while I was up<br/>
there.  It was a nice drive with the leaves changing.  I just love fall!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I better head off now.  I hope you had a great weekend, and thank you<br/>
again for sending the letterbox my way.<br/>

ps.  How are you counting the snail mail box.  I think right now my<br/>
inclination is to count it as a regular find.  I don't want to add even more<br/>
columns to my count.  It can be confusing as it is.  I'm not sure though.<br/>
What do you think? <br/>
