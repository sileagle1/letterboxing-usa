<br/>
Location: Dry Creek Regional Park in Union City, CA<br/>
Parking: Park at the end of Tamarack Dr. which is off Mission Blvd. <br/>
The path starts at the Tamarack entrance.<br/>

It had been years since "Chief" Tolman and his students had done any <br/>
geological fieldwork at the peak located close to the Meyer's farm.  <br/>
Jeanette met Tolman once as he crossed the farm and headed to the far <br/>
peak. Little did she know that Cyrus "Chief" Tolman, the geology <br/>
professor from Stanford, was famous, that one day the peak would be <br/>
named after him, and that she would bequeath the farm to the East Bay <br/>
Regional Parks. She, too, would be in the history books.<br/>
<br/>
It was August 24, 1951, and Jeanette was excited.  Her sisters, <br/>
Mildred and Edith, were driving from Alameda.  The girls had planned <br/>
on rehabilitating the garden at the old cottage. Jeanette was up <br/>
early to prepare for the day. The thick, ominous fog was still <br/>
clinging to the ground. Normally, the sun would have burnt through <br/>
the fog by now. <br/>
<br/>
Walking out the door, Jeanette heard a thundering noise that sounded <br/>
like an explosion. She knew that something wasn't right. In all the <br/>
years that she lived on the farm she never heard such a thunderous <br/>
sound.  Quickly, she ran out of the house and headed down the High <br/>
Ridge trail. At the junction Jeanette took Tolman's trail. The cattle <br/>
were in the lower pasture by the creek, and she was concerned about <br/>
what might have happened to them. As she ran past the corral she <br/>
smelled smoke and noticed that the cattle where heading back to the <br/>
corral.  She then ran farther down the trail to the South Fork. The <br/>
smell of the smoke was stronger. Passing the junction, Jeanette saw <br/>
what had made the horrific sound. Scattered all over the hillside <br/>
were sections of a fragmented plane. Frightened and shocked, Jeanette <br/>
quickly raced back home to call for help. <br/>
<br/>
Fifty years later two history buffs were reading an article about <br/>
United Flight 615 that crashed into Tolman Peak. They couldn't find <br/>
any records on salvaged items from the wreckage. The article stated <br/>
that the plane had rolled down the east side of the hill. Curious and <br/>
hopeful, the two men decided to hunt for any remnants from the fatal <br/>
crash. <br/>
<br/>
Steve was too busy watching out for the cow patties to have noticed <br/>
that they were almost up at the gate by the eucalyptus grove. Mike <br/>
had seen the rabbit run over to the sycamore that was to the right of <br/>
the grove. Now the rabbit was stuck under some barbed wire and tree <br/>
branches.  It looked like the rabbit had tried to hide itself under <br/>
the old gnarly section of a fallen down tree. Mike went over and <br/>
rescued the poor little fellow.<br/>
<br/>
Steve continued on until he came to a huge sycamore. The tree's trunk <br/>
had grown horizontal, and Steve decided he would rest and wait for <br/>
Mike here. Looking around the tree he noticed an old cement watering <br/>
hole. As he glanced under the tree, he noticed a pile of rocks that <br/>
had something under it that looked rusty. Quickly, he started to <br/>
remove the rocks.<br/>
