I went to considerable time and some expense to do this on a volunteer<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am glad to hear that the www.letterboxing.org url is up and working.  Having<br/>
an easy-to-remember internet address will certainly be a benefit to the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
As you all know, I have taken several opportunities to brag about the<br/>
dedicated group of people who have been working together to get this new hobby<br/>
started.  This talk list, the Letterbox USA website, and all the great ideas<br/>
and new letterboxes that have come out of this group are the result of people<br/>
from all over the country contributing their individual talents and spare time<br/>
in order to help everyone involved in the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
I wish to point out that Randy has been a key person on this list of<br/>
volunteers who have made these nice things happen.  His technical advice has<br/>
been instrumental in helping Daniel and myself to work the bugs out of the web<br/>
site and talk list.  Randy has also been an active member of the group of<br/>
American letterboxing patriots that has refused to sit quietly and watch<br/>
commercialism and technology spoil the original charm and intrigue of<br/>
Letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I would be very disappointed if remarks like Adrian's were to finally push<br/>
Randy to lose interest in the hobby.  A quick scan of the talk list archives<br/>
will clearly show that while Adrian has offered us some facsinating insights<br/>
about the birthplace of letterboxing, his contributions to the talk list have<br/>
largely consisted of sour, disgruntled jabs concerning the introduction of the<br/>
hobby to people outside of Dartmoor.  He also states that he regrets his<br/>
involvement with Smithsonian magazine.  I, for one, am grateful for Adrian's<br/>
contributions, but we must understand that greater exposure could endanger the<br/>
hobby in his country, and he feels threatened and angry.  So please take his<br/>
words with a grain of salt and don't let it get personal.<br/>
<br/>
If we are to find something useful in Adrian's words, it is the notion that<br/>
Dartmoor does not require our services to survive.  The hobby is well-<br/>
established there, and is not in need of promotion.  It is a small area with a<br/>
fragile terrain and tens of thousands of letterboxes.  Our situation here is<br/>
very different.  We have declared the entire nation as the stage for our<br/>
endeavors, and have barely begun to establish ourselves.  The internet is the<br/>
only medium that could have allowed us to accomplish what we have, so far.<br/>
But we need only worry about ourselves.  The rest of the world will get along<br/>
fine without our assistance.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, back in the States, communication is the backbone of our hobby.  I<br/>
think the new options that Randy has offered our group are very promising.  As<br/>
far as the talk list is concerned, my opinion is "If it's not broke, don't fix<br/>
it."  It was very confusing for a while as the group migrated from the ILC<br/>
talk list to the L-USA list.  I don't think we will be doing ourselves any<br/>
favors by making another switch like that.  But memorable email aliases for<br/>
requesting info, etc. would be a nice benefit just as the new url will be.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Randy, for your contributions.  I guess I missed the bit about the<br/>
letterboxing kit request, but let me state for the record that I would be more<br/>
than happy to make up a letterboxing kit to get you started.  Send me your<br/>
address privately and I will send you everything you need.<br/>
<br/>
For that matter, if anyone else on the list has gotten stuck trying to locate<br/>
everything needed to put together their first letterbox, let me know.  We'll<br/>
work something out.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">To Randy and Adrian<br/>
	and the rest of my letterboxing friends...<br/>
<br/>
First, about "letterboxing.org"...<br/>
	I take full responsibility for initiating the procurement of this<br/>
domain name. I was VERY concerned, during the rather rancorous and<br/>
painfull exchanges that occurred late this summer (relating to the<br/>
"commercialism" of letterboxing) that someone else would 'claim' the<br/>
name and thus control its usage.  So I floated the idea of getting it to<br/>
a few people within the group whom I thought to be both agressively<br/>
interested in the growth of letterboxing, and, who I felt to be squarely<br/>
on the 'keep it free' side of the fence. Randy offered to take it upon<br/>
himself to obtain it, with, I am absolutely convinced, no personal<br/>
ulterior motive except to preserve availability of this name for all of<br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
	I find it hard, when telling someone where to go on the 'net to look up<br/>
letterboxing, to remember Dan's exact address, and so I am sure, a<br/>
potential "newbie" might also find it difficult. "Letterboxing.COM" is<br/>
so easy to remember. Well, dang it, so is "letterboxing.ORG", and I for<br/>
one am thrilled that 'we' (meaning, ALL OF US) now have that<br/>
convenience, thanks to Randy's efforts (and expenses, I must add).<br/>
<br/>
	Personally, I don't feel that "Letterboxing.org" should necessarily be<br/>
"owned" for the sole use of US letterboxers.  Dartmoor has a long<br/>
letterboxing tradition; we in the US are trying hard to get it going<br/>
here, and the Letterboxing USA page is a vehicle to promote this. I for<br/>
one would encourage links to as many Dartmoor-related pages as possible,<br/>
as well as links to letterboxers, say, in Canada or anyplace else.<br/>
<br/>
	Given the long history, popularity, and sheer multitude of letterboxes<br/>
in Dartmoor, I doubt if we in the US could ever come close to "taking it<br/>
over", as recently suggested by Adrian. But, we do need the web to grow<br/>
the hobby here; use of "letterboxing.org" is valuable tool. <br/>
<br/>
	By the way, I feel that we ALL owe Adrian (and several others) a vote<br/>
of thanks for being willing to be part of the famous Smithsonian<br/>
article. Given the nature (as I perceive it) of clue-sharing in<br/>
Dartmoor, I sense that some Dartmoor devotees may have a protective,<br/>
almost secretive, feeling about 'their' hobby. If so, Adrian may have<br/>
been risking the disdain of some by "coming out", so to speak, in an<br/>
internationally-published magazine. Yet, without that article, none of<br/>
this would have happened. So, thanks Adrian.<br/>
<br/>
	Lots of individuals, in many different ways, have gotten this thing<br/>
going. Please, lets keep it positive.<br/>

Very sorry about this stressful twist. I appreciate what you've done.<br/>
And, sorry about the delay in sending you some stuff - life has been<br/>
stressful here as well (altho not from letterboxing).<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing, all the items are in a pile and ready to go, and have been<br/>
for a while. Well, tomorrow morning, I promise......<br/>
<br/>
Keep smiling...<br/>
Erik<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">First, thanks for positive public and private comments.  I never<br/>
really wanted anything for setting up the domain other than to be<br/>
spared negative comments.  I was quite taken aback.  I could write<br/>
quite a bit on ethnic characterizations and terms, but will not.<br/>
<br/>
About the stamp carving kit, people did not see the message because <br/>
it was a private matter relating to letterboxing.org, and it was wrong <br/>
of me to bring it up in public.  I was frustrated.  Basically, people<br/>
asked to pay part of my costs ($120), and I said send me a stamp carving<br/>
starter kit instead, which I assumed would cost much less, but provide<br/>
more value, sort of an I'll give you my expertese, and you give me yours<br/>
sort of thing.  I never heard back and drew the wrong conclusion.  Thanks<br/>
for all the offers of a kit.<br/>
<br/>
I've been to Dartmoor, and I agree with Mitch that this is not Dartmoor,<br/>
and happen to also agree that the internet is an ideal (but not exclusive)<br/>
medium for development of the hobby outside of Dartmoor.  If people <br/>
from Dartmoor (or elsewhere) resent the hobby being developed outside that<br/>
area, I don't know what to say, other than I've never met a Swede who <br/>
resented recreational orienteering being developed outside of Sweden, or <br/>
an American resenting baseball being played in Asia or Central America.  <br/>
The Swedes still dominate orienteering, and America still dominates <br/>
baseball, and I'm sure Dartmoor shall always retain its cache and mistique<br/>
in the letterboxing world.  I really don't care which group or place <br/>
dominates any of these pastimes; it costs nothing to share an idea with<br/>
another person or culture, and usually both sides are inriched.<br/>
<br/>
As for uses of the letterboxing.org server, I truly do not care.  I am<br/>
not pushing to have the mailing list moved there, or pushing any other <br/>
uses.  As I said, I would prefer not to use the egroups list because <br/>
I do not like slow graphics and other advertising attached to my e-mail. <br/>
There is no other motivation, and if people are content with the egroups<br/>
list, fine.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this whole matter will not provide further diversion :-)<br/>
<br/>
Randy<br/>
