<br/>
Googled is not just a trail name, it is a line of letterboxers. Here <br/>
is how it started:<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time, actually around February 21, 2003, a bookstore <br/>
owner in San Luis Obispo, CA. "googled" the name of his store. He <br/>
wanted to see who had linked to it, you know the feeling. Anyway, he <br/>
found that a certain nepherious letterboxer, who shall remain <br/>
nameless but his initials are Ryan Carpenter, had planted a microbox <br/>
in that store.<br/>
<br/>
The owner of the store and his manager, a certain rodent who can toss <br/>
three or more objects in the air at once over-and-over again, <br/>
followed the clues and found the microbox. The owner thought the idea <br/>
was stupid, but his manager secretly thought it intriguing. She told <br/>
a coworker and her best friend. <br/>
<br/>
That rodent manager and her best friend became diligent letterboxers. <br/>
They thought it might be nice to have a name for themselves and <br/>
anyone who was later turned onto letterboxing by them. They decided <br/>
that since the owner had "googled" the name, that they would become <br/>
Googled (sometimes abbreviated as 10**100D, or ten to the hundredth <br/>
power.) They took as their motto the button label on the website <br/>
Google, "I'm Feeling Lucky!" And indeed, they were.<br/>
<br/>
To become a member of Googled, all you have to do is to be turned <br/>
onto letterboxing by the fanatics who started it or the ones they <br/>
turned onto it, or the ones that... well, you get the idea. Oh, <br/>
Googled has bestowed the dubious honor of being members on Ryan <br/>
Carpenter and Amanda from Seattle. They may regret that they remained <br/>
silent when asked about it. Googled took it as assent. Pushy group!<br/>
<br/>
I cannot name all the members of Googled. By now some of <br/>
the "downline" have stretched far beyond telling. I wonder if the <br/>
newest members even know they are members? Maybe when it comes time <br/>
for the initiation ceremonies (the initiates must bring their own <br/>
goat's blood and Wesson Oil, it's the rule) they can be told.<br/>
<br/>
A partial list might include:<br/>
<br/>
JugglerMouse<br/>
Ash Raven<br/>
Emily Rose<br/>
Doubtful Katherine<br/>
The Abbess<br/>
Pandy<br/>
Iron Bear<br/>

Unless there's a another team that I'm not familiar with, and that may be<br/>
true, can the Team Ravenhurst you're referring to, actually mean Team<br/>
Rayvenhaus?  If there is a Team Ravenhurst, I think that's awesome!  If<br/>
there's not, and we're the only Blackwinged Team around, that's awesome too!<br/>

Okay what if a jolt of adrenaline goes through your system just by <br/>
reading this message....does this mean I am googled? Even though I <br/>
have been at it since April 2003 and was originally turned on via my <br/>
own discovery?  <br/>
<br/>
PS Duck Duck LB is one of my all-time favorites!!! The stamp wowed me <br/>
and while sitting on that hunk of stone, one of those Southerly <br/>
lizards stopped and posed for me! It was all silvery and slick!!!<br/>

<br/>
You are absolutely right "Googled" is a search engine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is also the name of a letterboxing group that originated in SLO<br/>
California and then migrated and is now becoming rather large (thanks to me<br/>
<giggle>) in the Pacific Northwest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The group's name evolved when one enchanting and stimulating young woman was<br/>
Googling with her co-workers one day and put in the name of the bookstore<br/>
they worked at and came up with a link to one Ryan Carpenters letterboxes.<br/>
The letterbox was planted in the bookstore without the knowledge of the<br/>
employees.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This astonishing young woman then told her Badger boyfriend about it, which<br/>
then told his sweet little chaos creating friend and his daughter, who then<br/>
told their friends and pretty soon there was a whole letterboxing line that<br/>
descended from this Google experience.  One of us then suggested we make a<br/>
club so to speak of local letterboxers and in honor of how the whole thing<br/>
underwent the group was named Googled.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Googled group if you ask me is full of some of the most creative and<br/>
talented and active letterboxers that you will come across. I do not think<br/>
you can ask for men to be move active and involved in letterboxing, hosting<br/>
wonderful events and putting out some of the most magnificent stamps as does<br/>
Sir B and RayvenDad.  As for caving potential there are very few that I<br/>
believe can compare with the carvings of Ms JugglerMouse.  The group is also<br/>
full of wonderfully supportive significant others such as RayvenMom and<br/>
Iron`Bear and includes some very infamous letterboxers like Ryan Carpenter<br/>
and Amanda From Seattle.  Plus there are just really awesome gothic chicks<br/>
like AshRaven and me. Though I am really unsure what exactly my talent in<br/>
letterboxing really is. I do think when it comes to persistence Ash Raven<br/>
and I claim the prize there. ----<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So that is my shot at elucidation of Googled, perhaps Sir B will do a bit<br/>
better.  Personally I think the members of Googled are so awesome that I am<br/>
starting a new campaign<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Googled for Senate!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well<br/>
