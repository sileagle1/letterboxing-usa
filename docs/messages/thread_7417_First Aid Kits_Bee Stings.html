Hmm, as a veteran of more bee stings than I could ever count[1], there<br/>
are a number of techniques that I've used successfuly reduce<br/>
swelling.  In order of preference:<br/>
<br/>
1. Benadryl pills.  Slightly reduces the swelling and definitely takes the<br/>
edge off of the sting.<br/>
2. Ice<br/>
3. Meat tenderizer to break down the venom.<br/>
4. Topical Caladryl.<br/>
5. Topical hydrocortisone (but this never did all that much for me)<br/>
6. Ibuprofen, if you've got nothing else.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;Does anyone onlist know where we could get a bee sting kit? We think we'd <br/>
&gt;better start carrying one in our kit.<br/>
<br/>
"Bee Sting Kits" are for use when you are allergic to bee stings, and<br/>
usually are a mini-syringe of epinephrine.  You need a prescription to<br/>
get one.<br/>

disturbed while portaging a canoe... whew.<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Below is a cut and paste of an earlier post of mine to the list that describes a homeopathic, non-prescription bee sting treatment. Since there were some new concerns, voiced and many of us are variously allergic, at the risk of redundancy, I re-post the contents. </p>
<p>Recently, my hometown, Syracuse NY ABC-TV affiliate WIXT, aired a health segment on treating bee stings after a local doctor succumbed to one. I recently got stung and have had a mild, yet prolonged allergic reaction for two weeks. </p>
<p>I contacted WIXT who kindly sent me the transcript of the segment where a homeopathic product was mentioned that works for some people. I like that this product is not heat sensitive like epi-pens.  Below is that transcript.</p>
<p>"...A PHARMACIST TOLD HER ABOUT THIS, A HOMEOPATHIC REMEDY CALLED APIS, SHE WENT TO THE HEALTH FOOD STORE<br/>AND BOUGHT SOME.  UNLIKE THE EPI PENS WHICH ARE HEAT SENSITIVE, APIS CAN BE CARRIED IN THE CAR, AND AS YOU SAW, IT'S ALSO SMALL ENOUGH TO KEEP IN YOUR PURSE.  IT'S ALSO QUITE INEXPENSIVE...WE CHECKED WITH A HEALTH FOOD STORE AND THEY SELL IT FOR FOUR DOLLARS FOR 75 TABLETS.  BUT THEY SAY  IT DOESN'T WORK FOR<br/>EVERYONE, SO YOU NEED TO HAVE A BACKUP PLAN."</p>
<p>Hope this helps all of us. If anyone has used this either of these products after a bee sting, I would like to know what your experiences have been like. Thanks.</p>

<br/>
There is a product on the market called After Bite.  I've used it on bee <br/>
stings...it burns at first, but it takes away some of the sting.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the stinger goes...NEVER, NEVER remove the stinger with a pair of <br/>
tweezers.  This will squeeze more venom into the wound.  Scrape it out with <br/>
the flat edge of a pocketknife or a credit card.  Push it out opposite of <br/>
the direction it is going in.<br/>

treatment: baking soda mixed with a little water to make a paste, then <br/>

(and my mother and grandmother before me) - very quickly soothes and stops <br/>
the pain, and can be re-wet or reapplied as it dries if the pain comes <br/>
back.  I often see a discoloration in the dried powder directly over the <br/>
sting, which must be venom getting sucked out during the drying process.<br/>
