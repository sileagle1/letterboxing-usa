                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry for the confusion...  An Easter Egg is just the term I use to <br/>
refer to what others call "bonus boxes" or simply "hidden clues" -- a <br/>
surprise set of clues hidden inside another box.  Easter Eggs are <br/>
commonly found in computer software, games and other media -- a non-<br/>
published surprise or tidbit that creators have hidden in their <br/>
creation for you to find and enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Just made sense to me to relate the term to letterboxing since it is <br/>
the same concept.<br/>
