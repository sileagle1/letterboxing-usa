Planted by Rubaduc 11-10-02<br/>
<br/>
I planted this as a thank you to all the kind considerate letterboxers<br/>
out there who never mentioned my misspelling of Harwinton in a previous<br/>
planting. Since I now know how to spell, I find myself with an extra G,<br/>
and as with almost <br/>
anything extra, it must become part of a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Nice easy trail. Maybe an hour.<br/>
Directions: From Rt. 4 West in Harwinton, take a left onto South Road.<br/>
Travel 1.7 miles till you see a sign for Roraback Wildlife Management<br/>
Area. Parking for 6 or 7 cars.  Roraback encompasses 2222 acres, small<br/>
game and archery hunting is allowed so wear orange in season.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: To the right of the sign is a grassy drive with a green metal<br/>
gate. Follow this road till it opens up into fields. Go left into the<br/>
next field and then kitty corner through that one in a southwesterly<br/>
direction to pass through a forest alleyway into the next field. Again<br/>
you kitty corner in a southwesterly direction, passing an area that has<br/>
been cleared of trees, and into another field (patience, we're soon to<br/>
run out of fields). This field is exited the same way as previous ones<br/>
but this leads you into the woods, there you'll follow and unmarked trail<br/>
till you come to a pond and then continue around it to the left. You may<br/>
have to traverse a few roots along the water's edge but it soon gets<br/>
better. None of the trails are marked but if you keep the pond on your<br/>
right, you can't get lost. At the far end of the pond is a dam where you<br/>
turn right to walk over the top of it and follow a gravel road to a fork,<br/>
bearing right as it enters the woods. Keep following the wide forest road<br/>
along the pond (ignoring left trails) until you lose sight of water for a<br/>
little while. Watch on your right for a large almost white boulder that<br/>
practically screams letterbox to you, water comes back into view at this<br/>
point also. There's a faint path leading to the treasure, be sure not to<br/>
be seen as there are sometimes  quite a few people hiking here. After<br/>
stamping in, continue in the same direction, keeping the pond on your<br/>
right, bearing right when necessary, and you will come to swampy area<br/>
where the pond ends. Continue up a slight incline that makes a sharp left<br/>
turn onto a wide lane that also is a slight incline and brings you out<br/>
onto South Road where your car is parked a few hundred feet to the right.<br/>
<br/>
As you head back to Rt. 4, take a right onto Shingle Mill Road, a quaint<br/>
dirt road (not very long) when you get to paved road, take a right, and<br/>
drive half a mile to the Western Headquarters of DEP. Well worth a visit.<br/>
