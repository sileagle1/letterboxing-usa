The naturalist told me that the area is full of debris from the <br/>
hurrciane. He said it was wise of us to remove them prior to Isabel <br/>
striking.<br/>
<br/>
We are still dealing with the aftermath, but thankfully we have water <br/>
and power. There are so many in the area that are in worse shape.<br/>
<br/>
We've had fun looking through the log books.  We recoginize so many <br/>
signature stamps from the Riverbend gathering.  Thanks to those who <br/>
have stamped in :-)<br/>
<br/>
We also picked up D's Birthday Party HH. What a great party idea!  <br/>
We'll send it along soon.  Happy Belated Birthday to D.<br/>
