I use a very thin foam backing that has adhesive on one side.  I stick all my stamps on this backing.  It provides a nice soft and spongy backing so that the image is easily transferred when inked and pressed to the logbook.  Sometimes the wood warps and causes problems.  The thin foam can be found at a craft store - I get mine at Michael's arts and crafts.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Any handmade stamp is fine in my book. The one problem I've<br/>
encountered with foam stamps is their tendency to absorb tons of ink,<br/>
becoming waterlogged with the stuff. The stamp impression then will<br/>
soak through the pages in a logbook.  A backing of some kind is<br/>
necessary for these stamps. Foam stamps do wear out faster than ones<br/>
made from soft block carving media. <br/>
<br/>
I have taught stamp carving to kids in both summer camp and parks and<br/>
recreation classes. With some supervision, a six year old can carve a<br/>
very nice stamp using the Speedball linoleum gouge. This tool is not<br/>
nearly as lethal as an Xacto knife almost as safe as scissors. Younger<br/>
than that, foam or scratchboard are good options. Scratchboard is the<br/>
styrofoam sheet that meat is packaged in at the supermarket. In the<br/>
last class I taught, the best stamp in the class was carved by a kid<br/>
about six. Good luck! Funhog<br/>
