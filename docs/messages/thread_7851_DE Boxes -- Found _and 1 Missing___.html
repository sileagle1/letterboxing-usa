                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a great time in Delaware this past week and found all of the <br/>
boxes I searched for except the Cape Henlopen Tower box.<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure I had the right place, it would have been pretty hard <br/>
to mistake the gnarly pine tree.  But after looking in every nook and <br/>
crook up to my head (I am tall) and around the base and under the low-<br/>
lying branches, did not find the box.  I even went back a 2nd day, <br/>
thinking I might have just overlooked it the first time, since this <br/>
one didn't seem to be difficult.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed in a message on 9/9/02, FireFly had found this box and <br/>
mentioned it was rather soggy and I had taken extra supplies with me <br/>
in case I could help clean it up...  but never even found the box.  <br/>
Not sure what happened to this one since then -- or maybe I just <br/>
overlooked it?<br/>
<br/>
The boxes I did find were:<br/>
<br/>
Cape Henlopen SP<br/>
Gordon's Pond<br/>
Sounds of Sirens<br/>
Assawoman Tower<br/>
Ducky at Assawoman<br/>
The Owl and the Pussycat<br/>
<br/>
All were in good condition and fun searches!  Gordon's Pond was an <br/>
especially lovely hike!  Some very nice stamps also! <br/>
<br/>
I also planted 2 boxes in Delaware while I was there -- clues to <br/>
follow later today or tomorrow.<br/>

I'm so glad to hear that someone found my Delaware boxes.  I was convinced that they would be left unfound until next summer - beach season!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you missed the second Cape Henlopen box - I pulled it for Daphnesfamily last weekend.  It was a soggy mess.  <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to finding your DE boxes - although I doubt I'll get to them until next summer - beach season!<br/>

awesome sunrise pictures when I went back to check the second day!<br/>
