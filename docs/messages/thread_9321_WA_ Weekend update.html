                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK OK Ryan and Fudrick thanks for assuring me that Candle in the Wind <br/>
is where it is supposed to be.  Grrr so I guess I should check it out <br/>
since I failed so horribly last time.<br/>
<br/>
Today I did the Thurston County loop trying to gather DVN2R SKR many <br/>
boxes south of Olympia.  I visited the always perplexing Mima <br/>
Mounds.  A great place for those mystified by geology.<br/>
<br/>
Then on to Millersylvania SP and instantly came upon DVN2R SKR and Mr <br/>
Trecker ( and one of the adventurettes) in the parking lot.  Trecker <br/>
and I exchanged stamps and found our way to the two boxes in the <br/>
park.  We agree that this is a great venue for a get together.  <br/>
Camping, large diverse area and wonderful picnic area and lake.<br/>
<br/>
I went on to Mc Lean Creek Nature Area and can assure DVN2R SKR that <br/>
the two boxes there are safe and sound.  Hundreds of spawning salmon <br/>
fill the creek and there is the smell of fish in the air.  <br/>
Impressive "humpie" Coho thrashed swirled and scuffled.  You could <br/>
see them up close and personal, even watched two fight and bite each <br/>
other on the face. ( Oh BTW, Beavers like Hemlock  ;-))<br/>
<br/>
Ryan I am surprised you have not visited these boxes so near the <br/>
freeway!<br/>
<br/>
I found a familiar HH "Thunderbolt" at the "Tree From a Stump" left <br/>
there by the 7 Nails when they picked it up at my "Waughop" LB.  I <br/>
took Thunderbolt to another monstrous place figuring he would feel at <br/>
home there.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to tackle Snoqualmie Falls tomorrow but perhaps need to <br/>
find Candle before it blows out again. <br/>

<br/>
I'm only human!  =)  And anyhow, I haven't spent too much time this <br/>
last year out in the Pacific Northwest, and you guys are hiding them <br/>
faster than I've been able to find them.  When I actually get a job <br/>
and have to settle down again, though, watch out!  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of weekend updates....<br/>
<br/>
I caught Letterboxing Fever at Beneath the Blue #1, but lost the <br/>
disease while heading for warmer climates.<br/>
<br/>
Beneath the Blue #2 is also alive and well.  Nobody but me has ever <br/>
visited it, though, and it's slowly building up a pretty thick layer <br/>
of dirt making the box look like it's been burried!  Next time <br/>
someone visits, they may have to do some digging to get it!  (The box <br/>
was also pretty waterlogged, but Ziploc successfully saved the day.)<br/>
<br/>
Nabbedd the Goofy Pub Series before I left Portland.  (Did anyone <br/>
notice that the Paisley Orca didn't post her clues for that park <br/>
until AFTER I left Portland for who knows how many months?  *sigh*)  <br/>
Actually, I missed the second to the last box.  It might be there and <br/>
I just didn't find it.  For some reason, I just can't think like a <br/>
Canadian Goose.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Yachats 804 box is alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
Van Duzer Corridor box is alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
Redcrest Fairyland Letterbox is alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
I went to hunt down the Pack 29 box in Windsor, California.  I was <br/>
driving south down 101, so I didn't exactly follow the directions <br/>
given, but I kept my eyes open for an Arata exit (even twisting my <br/>
head around to read the highway signs in the other direction!).  I <br/>
never saw any, and by the time I reached San Luis Obispo, I figured I <br/>
must have passed it.  =)<br/>
<br/>
I also was planning to nab a bunch of boxes from San Francisco to San <br/>
Jose, but got bored of my on-going road trip and decided to end it a <br/>
day early.  Perhaps I'll hit the boxes the next time I'm in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and of course I've placed several new boxes for the drive down <br/>
(or up, depending on how you look at it) Highway 101, which will be <br/>
appearing here shortly.  Keep your eyes open!  =)<br/>
