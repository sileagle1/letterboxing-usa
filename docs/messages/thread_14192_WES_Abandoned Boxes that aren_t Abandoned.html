&gt; In both of these cases, the box was probably transferred by the <br/>

&gt; Search by the box name to see what I mean.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [LbNA] Abandoned Boxes that aren't Abandoned<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I did the search in VA by Abandoned Boxes and came up with a bunch <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; boxes that belong to people I know are still active in <br/>
letterboxing.  <br/>
&gt; Then I did a search by the person's name and, sure enough, the <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; are listed by the person's name.  For instance, in VA, Let's Have a <br/>
&gt; Picnic is listed as Abandoned but when I searched for Tammy's <br/>
boxes, <br/>
&gt; it shows up there.  It is linked to Tammy's website.  So how did it <br/>
&gt; get designated Abandoned?  She obviously took whatever steps were <br/>
&gt; necessary to move the clues to the new site.  Another example -- <br/>
Top <br/>
&gt; Secret (in VA) is listed as Abandoned but is also on the list of <br/>
&gt; Knights of Columbo boxes and is linked to their webpage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let's not be so hasty to call a box abandoned.  <br/>
