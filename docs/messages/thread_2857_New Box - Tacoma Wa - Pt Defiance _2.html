<br/>
Point Defiance Park  #1  and   #2<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your journey starts at Point Defiance Park located in Tacoma, Washington.<br/>
The only time you will need to leave the trail is to recover the Letterbox.<br/>
Please respect the park and leave with more trash than you arrived with.<br/>
<br/>
You will want to enter the park on Pearl Street. Follow the signs to 5-mile<br/>
drive and look for the Gig Harbor Viewpoint. This is your starting point.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your walk.fairly easy good paths, takes an hour or less to find the<br/>
first box maybe an hour to two to find the second one..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

start walking.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-At the circle 210 degrees is best.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-Two triangles?  Head east.<br/>
<br/>
-Left 10 or 20 paces left.<br/>
<br/>

next 80 degrees<br/>
<br/>
-When ahead is a circle a square a triangle 220 is your course<br/>
<br/>
-Two pair of red squares, ignore the first<br/>
<br/>
-From the center of the triangle, easy since he died, at 270 go 20 or 40<br/>
with the animals<br/>
<br/>
-240 is your target, a fallen tree and a stump<br/>
<br/>
