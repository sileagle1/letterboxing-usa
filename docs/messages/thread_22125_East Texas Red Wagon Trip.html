<br/>
I just had to share my outing today with everyone. This afternoon<br/>
my 3 1/2 year old and 1 year old headed out to Rusk to hopefully be<br/>
the 1st fider of the TX RR 2. We were the 1st Finders. This was my<br/>
1st Finder find in the wild. It was great. After a picnic we<br/>
headed back to Jim Hogg State Park for the 2nd attempt at Starry,<br/>
Starry Night. I decided this time to take the Red Wagon for my 1<br/>
year old to ride in. Of course I had forgotten how rugged the<br/>
terrain was and how far the letterbox was, not to mention the 90+<br/>
degree temperature. We did however find the box after a jaunt down<br/>
the wrong trail. The signs pointing which trail to take were<br/>
knocked down and just leaned up against a tree so we went quite a<br/>
ways out of the way before we finally found the box. It was worth<br/>
it. The stamp was beautiful. Anyway the red wagon worked well. It<br/>
has all terrain rubber tires and was a life saver. My 3 1/2 year<br/>
old decided he would ride for most of the trip so I pulled around 60<br/>
pounds of children for about 3 hours in the scorching heat but like<br/>
they say no pain, no gain. We had a great time and thanks Barefoot<br/>
Lucy for another great box.<br/>
