<br/>
My wife and I are new to this hobby, and are getting quite <br/>
interested in it.  We are potentially planning a trip to North <br/>
Dakota (we live in Eastern PA) next summer.  We've noticed that <br/>
there are only 3 boxes in ND, all in the west, and we'll be in the <br/>
East.  We've thought about placing a box somewhere in Eastern ND, <br/>
but since it is far from home, we would not be able to check up on <br/>
it.  Is there any etiquette to say we can't do this?  We were <br/>
considering placing the box and then putting in a note to any finder <br/>
to return it back home by mail after a year or two.  Does anyone <br/>
have any thoughts about doing something like this?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I have a box in Alaska and I live in CT.  My brother lives in Alaska and checks on it about once a year.  To date, only 4 people have visited the box since I placed it last year.  There aren't that many people that letterbox in AK, I guess.  I don't know of any written etiquette on this subject.  There may be a reason why there aren't that many boxes planted in Eastern, ND.  Could be that people in that area aren't familiar with letterboxing or maybe there are National Parks there and we aren't supposed to plant there.  Your idea of putting a note in the box to return in a few years sounds like a good one.  You should include your e-mail address so that if the box gets disturbed or is found out in the open somewhere, someone can contact you and either put it back or return to you.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts...<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

I see that you have found a few of my letterboxes - I am in Reading,<br/>
not too far from you and spend a lot of time in Downingtown because my<br/>
daughter lives there.  The Mid Atlantic board is a very good one to<br/>
join, it is specifically for letterboxers. The group from the eastern<br/>
Pennsylvania area are all very friendly and we often do boxes<br/>
together.  It is great to be able to compare "war stories" with people<br/>
who are personally familiar with the particular boxes that you are<br/>
working with, either because we have also searched for them or planted<br/>
them.  If you are interested, the site is<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lbma/.  I look forward to talking to you<br/>
there,<br/>
Jan of Team Little Dog<br/>

&gt; I live in Downingtown, am not on the mid-atlantic talk list - is it <br/>
&gt; just for boxers?  or is it a list in general.  Don't have time for <br/>
&gt; general chat, but do occasionally like to browse boxing lists.<br/>
