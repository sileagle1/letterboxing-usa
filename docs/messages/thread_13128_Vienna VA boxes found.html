<br/>
This weekend Johnny Nomad and I got out between the rain showers to <br/>
find all 3 In the Park Sports Series and Be's Search for the Mushroom <br/>
Kingdom. Then we called it quits, b/c it looked like another rain <br/>
cloud was moving in and we had done enough mud mucking for one day!<br/>
<br/>
All the boxes are in good condition, a bit damp, but doing fine.<br/>
It was a lot of fun running around from park to park. Who knew there <br/>
were so many little parks in that area. And I know there were more we <br/>
could have found, just ran out of time and energy.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see many of you Saturday at Riverbend! <br/>
