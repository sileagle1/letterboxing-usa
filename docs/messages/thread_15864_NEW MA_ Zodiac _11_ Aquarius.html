Fisk Cemetary<br/>
Chester, MA (Hampden County)<br/>
<br/>
Placed: Sept 18, 2003 by TehutiKa, AsetKa and kids! <br/>
Distance: Depends how long you wander around....<br/>
Time: As long as it takes to find it!<br/>
Difficulty: Hard<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Fisk Cemetary is on Bromley Rd. This<br/>
cemetary was moved from it's previous location to the<br/>
current one to prevent it from being flooded over as<br/>
part of the Knightville Dam project. Considering the<br/>
age of the majority of the stones, we found it fairly<br/>
impressive that they bothered to do so. The cemetary<br/>
is still in active use.<br/>

Your clues are awesome! Better than mine but you might just take a look at my <br/>
Sutter Cemetery (CA) Box.<br/>

Glad you like them. As I'd hope would be obvious at<br/>
this point, the Zodiac boxes are all hidden in<br/>
cemetaries, both large and small, around Western Mass.<br/>
The clues are all in relation to someone that is<br/>
buried at the cemetary that was born under the sign of<br/>
the box that is hidden there. There was only one<br/>
cemetary that we went to where we were unable to plant<br/>
a box because we couldn't find anyone born at the<br/>
appropriate time, and that didn't happen until today. <br/>
<br/>
If you ever make it out this way, let me know. We'll<br/>
hit the trails together. :-)<br/>

We usually go to east MA when we go but now we have a<br/>
great excuse to explore the western end. Thanks!<br/>
