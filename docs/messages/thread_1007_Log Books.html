Mine is a mishmash arranged tentatively around chronological order.  Each stamp goes on the right-facing page, with a title that consists of box name, park name, date found.  Then on the left-facing page goes the narrative.  But it's all together, found boxes, placed box stamps, personal stamps (I have three versions of my husband's trail stamp *grin*).  I try to get fairly detailed (or as detailed as space permits) in the narrative- who was there, what the weather was like, history of the area, amusing anecdotes, blah blah blah.<br/>
<br/>
Your way sounds much more organized and interesting, though.  I like the trail map idea...I might have to steal that one!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

We use a 5.5" x 8.5" Strathmore Sketch Pad.   It's their 400 Series recycled, acid free, medium weight, lightly textured pad and I user this one because of the size and the acid free and the recycled content.<br/>
<br/>
On each page, I split it in 1/2 by drawing a line on it and then, in that area, I place the found stamp in the upper left corner. From there down, like a newspaper column past a picture, I write specifics. Date, Time, Number, The rating on the ease of location and then a description of the clues that lead us there.<br/>
<br/>
On the backside I place the names of who was on this trek.<br/>

a cross between letterboxing and travel journal. I write in my <br/>
journal when I'm on vacation about our trip and stuff we've done, <br/>
funny stuff etc. And since I'm always letterboxing while on <br/>
vacation, I keep it in the same place. As for letterboxing info, I just <br/>
write a note about the search, weather, mishaps, first finder stuff <br/>
etc. As well as the date time and name of the letterbox. I like that <br/>
they're together because When I go back and read my travel <br/>
stories, it makes me read the letterbox stories too. That's it.<br/>

each have a lined composition book, the kind used in school. It's a good<br/>
size for toting around and the extra hard covers help with the rough travel<br/>
the books are treated to. At a minimum, each box has a page with it's stamp,<br/>
the name of the box and city it was found in, the date it was found, name of<br/>
the series (if it is part of one), and a print out of the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids plan to just go this far with it, others intend to every six<br/>
months or year, tear out the stamped pages and create a scrapbook type<br/>
permanent record, where they can add in other items from the hikes. I bring<br/>
along a camera, though we usually are having so much fun that we forget to<br/>
actually take any photos. If I do remember to take a few shots, I give each<br/>
kid their own copies to add as well. We have a couple of budding artists who<br/>
also like to sketch or paint the locations where we find the boxes and, once<br/>
dry, those get tucked into the book.<br/>
