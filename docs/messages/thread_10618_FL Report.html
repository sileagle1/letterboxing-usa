                    <html><body>D and Shoo spent a week in southern Florida warming up and seeking letterboxes!   We found:
<br/>
<br/>Tiki Idol
<br/>Florida Friends
<br/>Shh - There's a Secret!
<br/>
<br/>All are in good condition and were wonderful hikes.  Tiki Idol is one of those letterboxes where it was harder to find the park than to find the letterbox since the park is very new.  If your AAA map doesn't have it, look in the phone book.
<br/>
<br/>We could not find:
<br/>
<br/>Loggerhead
<br/>Morikami
<br/>
<br/>Both of these are in parks that are "well-groomed," and it seems likely that the landscapers found them before very many letterboxers found them.
<br/>
<br/>Keep warm!  D and Shoo
