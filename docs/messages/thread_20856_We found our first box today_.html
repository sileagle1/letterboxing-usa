Today my son (age 14) and I went out to look for our first Letter Box.<br/>
I homeschool him and thought this would be a nifty activity for us to<br/>
get out of the house and do. <br/>
<br/>
We found the site but being in the woods absolutly EVERYTHING was<br/>
covered in 4" of leaves! Well I looked in the tree where it was<br/>
supposed to be and saw nothing so I started looking in the vacinity.<br/>
The DS looked in the tree again and said "MOM, it's right HERE!" Well,<br/>
doh!<br/>
<br/>
He was skeptical about this when we first started the drive out but he<br/>
got into looking for the box and was just as pleased when HE found it.<br/>
He even is thinking about where we can leave a box. <br/>
<br/>
We stamped the clue page we printed and plan on keeping them in a note<br/>
book with any other maps etc we collect along the way.<br/>

writing clues and many more. Why don't you check out<br/>
the newbie list and your local area list. I think you<br/>
are in the mid-atlantic region. I think I saw on the<br/>
list someone e-mailed you those sites. They can be<br/>
very helpful and do tend to be a little less intense<br/>
than the big list. See you on the trails.<br/>

This is an excellent activity to do with  children/family and a great asset<br/>
to Home schooling, in my opinion.  I do not home school myself, but<br/>
definitely take advantage of opportunities to further my kids' education<br/>
through letterboxing.<br/>

That is great! My sister is teaching an elective class on letterboxing<br/>
 to her 6th and 7th grade Montessori students. She likes it because it<br/>
is very interdisciplanary with art, reading and writing, local history<br/>
and some computer saavy and research skills thrown in. Not to mention<br/>
they have a lot of fun!<br/>
