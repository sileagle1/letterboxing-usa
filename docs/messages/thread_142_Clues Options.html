The overall goal for using the internet is to provide you with the options you<br/>
need to find letterbox sites and to help others find your<br/>
sites with a minimum of fuss (for me as well as you).<br/>
<br/>
Toward that end I would like you to tell me what you want to see here.<br/>
The way it works now is adequate for the number of our current users, but it is<br/>
not likely to be adequate 6 months from now IMO.  I will need lead time to plan<br/>
whatever changes are necessary to accomodate an influx of people.  Please make<br/>
your needs and wishes known now so that whatever changes are made will reflect<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I don't plan to change the basic mapping structure.  Twice in the past<br/>
suggestions were made to change it and most of you did not want it changed so it<br/>
will remain as is.<br/>
<br/>
Proposed changes for posting clues:<br/>
<br/>
Modern e-mail notes can be made up of web-content.  Most people are familiar<br/>
with filling out forms.  So I will probably reduce the process of posting clues<br/>
to filling out a form and forwarding it to me, Mitch or someone else who can<br/>
register it on the site.<br/>
<br/>
Please give input if any you have.  My biggest concern for you is that you will<br/>
all be able to do this easily without special instructions.  I also want to make<br/>
sure you can make your finished clues reflect your personal tastes in color and<br/>
form.  At your option you may want to include contact information. You may or<br/>
may not want a regional map or clues map to be included.  You may also NOT want<br/>
any options at all.  In that case the basic form we now use will be selected by<br/>
default.  But what I see for the future (if its at all feasible) will be an<br/>
e-mail form that looks just like your finished page as its to be published.  You<br/>
will be able to type in the content (as its to appear), change the colors,<br/>
fonts, images etc. (as they are to appear) and then add whatever supplementary<br/>
information you feel is necessary to the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the porocess of determining whether or not this is feasible is finding<br/>
out (from you!) how it needs to work and what it needs to look like in order to<br/>
be <br/>
<br/>
               1) easy to use<br/>
and<br/>
               2) easy to customize and be creative<br/>
<br/>
Our current system only allows people with web publishing skills to be<br/>
creative.  It is NOT easy to use.  This has always been a glaring fault of web<br/>
publishing.  But there are ways to overcome that.  And I am willing to explore<br/>
possibilities, pick brains and create a form that will accomplish this for you.<br/>
<br/>
But I need your input.  Please do make some comments.  Some of you may be very<br/>
busy, but if you would at least state the number one thing of importance to you<br/>
I would appreciate it.  I respectfully ask you to not <br/>
say something like, "Why don't you create letterboxes instead?"<br/>
Remember, I'm not just taking up this concern for you.  Its for the newcomers<br/>
who have not started yet.  I view it as my primary role to create and maintain a<br/>
medium for you to share your clues.  I want this to work cleanly so that the<br/>
process of getting your clues out will be not much more difficult than writing a<br/>
letter or making a phone call.  Once I've done that and the system works and has<br/>
been amply tested<br/>
I will probably devote more of my efforts to letterboxes.  You know every group<br/>
has certain people who bring certain things to it. Some of you are artists, some<br/>
are map surfers, some are hikers or orienteerers or general hobbyists.<br/>
I'm a network technician who's into maps.<br/>
<br/>
OK.  Send some comments please.<br/>

I'm responding to your request for comments.  I like the idea of a<br/>
forms-based mechanism for folks to use to publish clues on the  Letterbox<br/>
USA site.  It seems like a good idea for those who do not want to "publish"<br/>
their own clue sites, and I'm all for that.  I think that the more hurdles<br/>
to publishing clues there are, the fewer clues will be published.  Then<br/>
again, I'm really a newbie at Letterboxing, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
If form-based publishing of clues takes off on L-USA, I'd still prefer to<br/>
create my own pages (as I have been), and hope for some way of linking the<br/>
map on L-USA to my clue pages.<br/>
<br/>
One way or another, I like the idea of the centralized "map" and general<br/>
information that L-USA provides, and would hope for some flexability in<br/>
manner of posting clues.<br/>

I'm all for an easy to create "Mad Libs"-like clue page.  Give us the<br/>
blanks to fill in and a few options on color and such and I'll be<br/>
content.  A preview option before the page is added would be good too.<br/>
 If you can find a way for us to add our own images, stamps and<br/>
photos, that would be a definite plus.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I started carving the first of my Door County<br/>
Lighthouse stamps, but I found that it requires a sharper blade than I<br/>
had available.  Those tiny pink pet erasers don't leave a lot of room<br/>
for mistakes!<br/>

I too am all for the development of a simple, e-mail form to get the<br/>
clues onto web pages, and thank you again for the committment that you<br/>
have and are showing to get it done. If Mitch's goal of all 50 states by<br/>
Y2K comes to pass, there will be lots of info to manage.<br/>
<br/>
Some of these suggestions as to content of the form are things I<br/>
suggested to Eric M. when he was trying to get his ILC database<br/>
established, they are I think relavent here as well.<br/>
<br/>
1. The basics - name of letterbox, and clue description, date placed,<br/>
are the bare minimums to get it posted.<br/>
<br/>
2. "ENCOURAGED"	options (i.e., up to the box owner) mightinclude:  name<br/>
of "owner", e-mail address to report problems, last date checked,<br/>
descriptive text about history, locale, where to park, etc. <br/>
<br/>
3.  I think its good to be able to place boxes in a 'series' if it is<br/>
possible without too much complication. Examples, Lake Champlain boxes,<br/>
Long Trail Boxes. If this can be done, I'd suggest the following "fine<br/>
tuning" options:<br/>
<br/>
	a. More than one person should be able to add to the series. Example:<br/>
Tom Cooch will likely place soom within the Long Trail - it would make<br/>
sense for someone to be able to find all the clues in the same place. <br/>
<br/>
	b.  Its important to be able to have descriptive text that pertains to<br/>
the series as a whole, as the text at the end of the Long Trail Series.<br/>
I had suggested to Eric M. a 'no-box, series header' type of form, but<br/>
he had no interest. Ideally, I think, this info should be at the start<br/>
of the series, not at the end. IMHO<br/>
<br/>
4. I like the option to include a stamp image if desired. Also, photos<br/>
of the locale add interet, if its easy enough to do. <br/>
<br/>
5. The maps are great as they are. I also like the map that shows boxes<br/>
along the trail, as shown at Pulpit Rock. This would be ideal as a way<br/>
to map a closely-linked series. I recognize that this typre of graphic<br/>
won't likely come out of a form, but, being able to insert one would<br/>
always be nice.<br/>
<br/>
6.  Ability to edit is important. Example, 2 recent re-locations due to<br/>
vandlism, removal of a box for the winter, errors not seen until<br/>
published, etc. I recognize the difficulty of allowing only the "owner'<br/>
to edit, which suggest some form of password. Ugh, now complications?<br/>
<br/>
7.  Being eble to have edit options for color, font, layout are all neat<br/>
if its doable, but, to me at least, secondary to the above. However,<br/>
adding a ling to another page location so people can still do their own<br/>
thing if they wish, is a good option.<br/>

<div>Hi Dan</div>
<div>            Well 
its the New Year. Resolutions made one of which is not to fall out with true 
friends. I think it all had something to do with your dream. I intend to be 
helpfull this year. I am back into boxing again. 20 new boxes to go out will let 
you have a couple of the clues to see how you get on adding a Dartmoor box to 
your site.</div>
<div>I have read this mornings email. I even printed 
it out most unusual for me. You have raised a very good point. I am still a bit 
worried about releasing my clues to any one but as mine get handed on by people 
over here what have i to lose.</div>
<div>I think the form is a great idea. Have some 
ideas on a format for it. Will get myself busy designing something and send it 
on to you. Its only two years now to the 21st century. I think we could all be 
the start of something new in letterboxing and i would like to be there from the 
start.</div>
<div>Now sit down for this i have clues for over 
countrys China, Spain, France, Australia, Canada, Italy, Germany, and others i 
will try to obtain the permission of the owners to post them to you. I also have 
a telephone number for someone in Canada who comes over here and has given an 
open invitation to anyone from over here to visit and find his boxes out there. 
I belive he has quite a few.</div>
<div>You may all know or not know that me and my wife 
Melissa split up back in Feb last year. I think your dream snaped something in 
me and broke the memories. Its fun how you what to get away from someone but 
afterwards you only remember the good times when the bad times far outwayed the 
good. I have been a bit bitter so appoligies to all.</div>
<div>Happy New Year All</div>
<div>Adrian</div>
<div>P.S didn't get out New Years day had a bad head 
for some reason.</div>
