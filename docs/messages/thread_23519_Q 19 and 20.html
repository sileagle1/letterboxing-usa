<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Options:  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
a)       Divide the town by streets, RR or some other major landmark<br/>
<br/>
b)      Ask another "list" type question (like we were doing before with<br/>
town names)..Is the box located within Broadmoor or Rocky Narrows or near<br/>
the Peace Abby?   <br/>
<br/>
c)  Work with "types" of locations:   Is the box located along a wall<br/>
bordering homes/private property?    Is the box located along the Bay<br/>
Circuit Path?   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We know it's not near the perimeter of a cemetery (which rules out 8<br/>
locations in Sherborn).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I personally think that trying to rule in/out lists of locations may be more<br/>
productive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, if you come to Sherborn, bring LOTS of bug repellant.    Sherborn is<br/>
about 70% swamp and the mosquitos almost carried my daughter and I away the<br/>
other afternoon.    Ticks are also very bad down here.   Full length<br/>
clothing is best.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think Gretchen's b) is a good move but it requires a list be made of <br/>
all parks or trails.  Then ask if it is in "that list" so any urban or <br/>
non-park areas are eliminated.  <br/>
<br/>
Since I won't be looking for this box, I leave in 'your' capable <br/>
hands.  Maybe designate Gretchen to ask the leading question so EL <br/>
would only have one choice to pick from?!?!<br/>
