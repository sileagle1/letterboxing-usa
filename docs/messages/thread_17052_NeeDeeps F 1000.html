                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congratulations to Lenny and Kathy, The NeeDeeps, on hitting the 1000 find<br/>
mark. A tremendous achievement. I wonder how many miles and miles of hiking<br/>
that took? Very glad to see you hit that mark. You certainly deserve it. I<br/>
know of the many days that you rose early and boxed all day into the<br/>
darkness, in good weather and bad. It's nice to see a nice couple like you<br/>
hit that 1000 mark.Congratulations again from your letterboxing friends.<br/>
