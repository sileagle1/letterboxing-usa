                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry to say, this box eluded us today.  We'd love to give it another <br/>
try someday soon.  If the owner of the box is still an active member <br/>
of this group, please contact me.  I'd like to get some clarification <br/>
about some of the clues which, when hiking the area, caused us some <br/>
confusion.  The hike in was difficult, steep, and rocky.  Not sure of <br/>
the accuracy of our hunt, we ventured off trail each time we spied a <br/>
pile of stones, or a rotten stump, scrambled up many outcrops, and <br/>
peeked and poked into several large stone juts.  If we'd have found <br/>
the box, it would have been luck and certainly not our expert <br/>
orienteering skills.  Going off trail in these thick woods was a <br/>
little disconcerting, but thanks to Katybug's good sense of <br/>
direction, we didn't have to depend on our compass too much.  Thanks <br/>
to Lauren, Information Asst. for the Appalachian Trail Conference for <br/>
the perfect directions to the Montebello Fish Hatchery.  The drive in <br/>
along the Blue Ridge Parkway was awesome.  <br/>
<br/>
We cut our last half mile to see Spy Rock in half when we were <br/>
stopped dead in our tracks by the back half of a rattlesnake lying <br/>
across the trail.  The rattle was large, as was the portion of the <br/>
snake not covered by brush.  I snapped a photo (thank goodness for <br/>
zoom lenses), and next time in, we'll peek and poke into stones with <br/>
sticks!  I hope the box is still in place and that we soon get <br/>
another chance at finding it.<br/>
