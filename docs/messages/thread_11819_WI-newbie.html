Veronica for a play that I am in. She led me to letterboxing as there <br/>
is a letterbox hidden in CT behind the stations of the cross.  Weird <br/>
thing is I am not catholic, but prayed the week before about finding <br/>
some fun family thing to do with my boys ages 12 and 14. Off we went <br/>
on a trip that the family thought would be a wild goose chase. We <br/>
found two letterboxes, and at the first stop a hitchhiker <br/>
(trailblazer)!<br/>
I was dancing with joy and the boys had a blast.  We are hooked.  <br/>
First time out and a hitchhiker under our belt!  This weekend off to <br/>
do the Oak leaf trail in Milw. area.<br/>
 I just joined this yahoo group and BOW to you all for starting this <br/>
wonderful hobby.<br/>
