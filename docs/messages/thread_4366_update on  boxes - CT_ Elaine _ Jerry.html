    I stopped by that box in early January while I was doing Sound View.  I<br/>
left a note like "Who took your stamp?". Is that what you saw? A family had<br/>
been last to visit before me and had not mentioned the stamp missing. I<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] update on boxes - CT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi All,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We found "Elaine &amp; Jerry's Bluff" today.  The box was<br/>
&gt; laying out in the open next to it's hidding spot.  The<br/>
&gt; log book was inside, but the stamp and stamp pad were<br/>
&gt; missing.  We rehid the box, but don't think  it's safe<br/>
&gt; there any longer as there was a note that appeared to<br/>
&gt; be from the person that took the stamp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We also found "Two Labs and a Box" intact, but the<br/>
&gt; stamp pad was dry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, to Heather, it appears "Turtle Creek" is<br/>
&gt; missing.  We came up empty handed on that one also.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope other people had better luck in their searches.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

Yes, we saw your log, and several people before you<br/>
had noted the stamp missing.  But, there was a log in<br/>
the book that read, I have your ____ stamp.  I am sure<br/>
someone visited after you, and left the box exposed. <br/>
Perhaps the thief, returning to the scene of the<br/>
crime?<br/>

as Elaine and Jerry's Bluff is concerned am very happy<br/>
that the box is still intact. I am planning on<br/>
visiting that box very soon. Please note that the<br/>
journal that is in there is not the original journal.<br/>
The second (i believe) journal is on display at the<br/>
Waterford Eastern Mountain Sports along with clues not<br/>
published on the LBNA website. And, glad to hear that<br/>
Two labs and  Box is still intact! I'll get out there<br/>
to add some life to the inkpad... it could be that<br/>
it's just frozen or cold... those pads don't work as<br/>
well in cold weather.<br/>
<br/>
**Letterboxing tip of the day (at least while it's on<br/>
my mind) - After stamping up on one journal, there is<br/>
usually still enough ink on the stamp for another<br/>
decent impression! All you have to do is add some<br/>
moisture from your breath and voila! Inked up and<br/>
ready to stamp! Great if the bugs are biting or if<br/>
frostbite is nipping!<br/>
