                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK -- some of these titles are a real stretch, but, we try...<br/>
<br/>
On our last day of vacation, we fought the fog once again to follow the <br/>
Upper Shamokin Falls Trail to the beautiful falls and a couple of boxes!  <br/>
Once again, we were anxious to see the changes the rains had made since <br/>
everything was virtually dried up from the drought during our visit last <br/>
summer.  Sure enough -- we could hear the falls from much farther up the <br/>
path.<br/>
<br/>
We tried to keep the kids to a slow sprint as they clambered down the <br/>
sloping trail plied with slipper rocks.  How to explain that if they run, <br/>
slip and fall they may just crack their little heads open on all those rocks <br/>
without dampening their enthusiasm?!  The tightrope we parents walk every <br/>
day!<br/>
<br/>
Mud was quickly covering the stain on my sneakers from where Miss Ma had <br/>
tumbled her s'more the night before.  They had clammored for s'mores only to <br/>
ask the helpers at the campfire to please hold the graham cracker and the <br/>
marshmallow!  OK -- I like a good chunk of Hershey as much as (if not more <br/>
than) the next guy but having it melted between the carbon coated mallow and <br/>
the graham just exponentially yummifies the whole experience.  Well, their <br/>
requests came in too late and Mom was reduced to attempting to pull off at <br/>
least one graham cracker and sucking the marshmallow off of the chocolate <br/>
(the sacrifices I make!!).  I finally got them clean down to the chocolate <br/>
when Be decided he didn't want it anymore (Da got that one) and Madeleine <br/>
dropped her now open-faced s'more right on my nice white Keds...<br/>
<br/>
Whoops -- I digress!  Back to the trail.  Be and Ma were skeddaddling down <br/>
ahead (I believe that is the official mountain term) and Da and I were <br/>
trying to figure out how we were going to airvack them out bleeding and <br/>
concussed to the nearest hospital ("I believe that was a helipad site we <br/>
almost drove off of in the fog the night before, darling"...) when we got to <br/>
the box site.  Be launched himself up toward the tree trunk only slip (we <br/>
knew it would happen) and land on his thumb.  No blood or brains leaking out <br/>
all over the forest but we'll be darned if you couldn't tell by the <br/>
hollering going on!!  After about ten minutes of thumb examination, the <br/>
application of a very cold water bottle and promises of a glow-in-the-dark <br/>
Sponge Bob Squarepants band aid upon our return, Mom scrambled up the slope <br/>
and retrieved the box.  Be was still too damaged to stamp in but the rest of <br/>
us did.<br/>
<br/>
Feeling very cocky and having fully recovered from injury, Ma and Be once <br/>
again sprinted down the rocky trail (you'd have thought they would be going <br/>
a little slower now, wouldn'tcha?  But Noooooo)<br/>
<br/>
We got down to the falls and enjoyed the sight.  There are lots of big rocks <br/>
to sit upon to rest and wonder.  Da even found a crawfish which Na quickly <br/>
poked with a twig to stop its escape under a nearby rock.  The poor crawfish <br/>
curled up into a paralyzed ball of fear and proceeded to lay there in a <br/>
catatonic state while Na and Da cooed over the splendor of the earth's <br/>
creatures (or something like that)  Of course, important scientific data on <br/>
the crawfish was not listed in any of the three guide books we had purchased <br/>
that morning in the nature center (we realize it's not a bird or a butterfly <br/>
but if it is not a backyard bug like thing, what is it?  We must have missed <br/>
the laminated guide on small mud inhabiting creatures that taste really good <br/>
heaped next to a side of gumbo (ooooeeee-- them's good eatin!!)<br/>
<br/>
We followed the directions and stood on a big rock (looking quite majestic, <br/>
I assure you) but had no luck finding the monkey!  We poked, prodded and <br/>
searched but nothing.  The area was plagued with gopher holes (or holes made <br/>
by something) but we would be darned if we were going to stick our little <br/>
hands down any of those suckers when our new three foot long pokey stick <br/>
disappeared down one such burrow!  We even brought out our flashlight much <br/>
to the amazement of the other families sunning on the rocks.  They must have <br/>
thought we had lost a wedding ring the way we were pouring over every nook <br/>
and cranny of those falls!  Oh well!  Disappointed, we headed back up the <br/>
trail (which somehow seemed to have gotten a lot steeperand wetter in the <br/>
meantime...) slipping and sliding on the rocks once again.  From there we <br/>
headed to the bungee trampolines which somehow seemed a little less scary... <br/>
