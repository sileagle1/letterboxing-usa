<br/>
We should probably buy stock in the Arrow map company since we've <br/>
purchased almost every road atlas they produce for New England! These <br/>
books are great and show what appears to be EVERY little side road, <br/>
etc. Excellent indexing and grid references for hard-to-find little <br/>
lanes as well. For a couple counties, we've had to get the Rand <br/>
McNally books which seem to cover just as much detail but are not <br/>
quite as easy on the eyes. Arrow is a regional brand while RMcN <br/>
prolly has books covering the entire US.<br/>
<br/>
Another option is to buy Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips or some similar <br/>
mapping program for your PC. These definitely cover the entire <br/>
country and get down to the level of little side streets as well, <br/>
often including national/state parks, etc. Using this software, I've <br/>
already planned our finding order for the boxes out by <br/>
Sacramento/Truckee (CA) for our upcoming trip there later this month <br/>
(we're in MA).<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails!<br/>

&gt; How do you research where a box is located.  Can you find detailed <br/>
&gt; street maps of most towns on the internet?  Major cities yes, but <br/>
&gt; smaller, rural towns can be more difficult.  I have used yahoo.maps <br/>
&gt; but is there a better site?<br/>
