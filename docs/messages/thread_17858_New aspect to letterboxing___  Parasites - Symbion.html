                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since the word parasite has a bad connotation and is<br/>
already defined as a Hitchhiker in the Letterboxing<br/>
World, I suggest calling your creations symbionts,<br/>
which means they live in harmony with their hosts.<br/>
Of course, the stamps you have already created are<br/>
considered parasites, so they would not fit the <br/>
definition and might be better off placed as a series<br/>
of boxes on their own.  Good luck with this.<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone,  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We had an idea that we thought was interesting and<br/>
&gt; wanted to share it with everyone to see what you<br/>
&gt; thought of it.  Our idea was to make parasites...I<br/>
&gt; know that on Silent Doug's site that he makes<br/>
&gt; reference to hitchhikers sometimes being called<br/>
&gt; "parasites", but we think this is somewhat different<br/>
&gt; than the ordinary hitchhiker.  Here is our<br/>
&gt; idea...Parasites would attach themselves to or<br/>
&gt; "infect" a "host" hitchhiker.  It would then travel<br/>
&gt; with that hitchhiker, until a) it was placed in a<br/>
&gt; hitchhiker hostel, where it would infect all other<br/>
&gt; hitchhikers with it's stamp and move to a new host<br/>
&gt; hitchhiker...and then travel again.  Or until, b)it<br/>
&gt; finds a new host hitchhiker  by chance in a letterbox.<br/>
&gt; Such as finding a hitchhiker when you are dropping one<br/>
&gt; off too.  It would then change hosts and be stamped in<br/>
&gt; the letterbox log also, and then travel again.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any opinions on this??...We think it would be kinda<br/>
&gt; cool to see if your hitchhiker, letterbox, or personal<br/>
&gt; logbook had been "infected" with a parasite.  To start<br/>
&gt; this, we have just finished creating nine stamps of,<br/>
&gt; what else?  Parasites!  Kinda gross, kinda funny.  We<br/>
&gt; have a tick, bedbug, mosquito, tapeworm, flatworm,<br/>
&gt; roundworm, flea, chigger, leech, and a roundworm ready<br/>
&gt; to infect hitchhikers.  They are all very small<br/>
&gt; stamps.  About 1/2 square or less.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyhow...just wanted to throw that out there for<br/>
&gt; comments.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy boxing!<br/>
