<div>Hi folks.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In thinking about the issues with National Parks an 
idea struck me. What I'm looking for is feedback and maybe someone to approach 
the NPs and see what they think about it. Unfortunately, I am just a 
brainstormer and do not have the time, nor NP close by to run this up the 
flagpole so to speak. If anyone wants to run with it, be my guest!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This last year My husband and I were visiting the 
Dry Tortugas National Park off the Florida Keys and came across a National Park 
Passport that is offered by the Parks. What it is is a book giving info about 
the different parks by region and so forth and has areas for stamping just like 
a travel passport. I questioned the lady at the desk about it and she said that 
all NPs have a date stamp with an insignia at the desk of the park gift shop or 
HQ buildings and that all you have to do is take your passport book and ask for 
the stamp. Well...in thinking about it, why not see if the Park folks would be 
willing to allow individuals to place hand made stamps along with this date and 
insignia stamp so that people could also add that stamp to their passports, as 
well as to their letterboxing stamp collection??? Maybe the individual could 
also have some of the letterboxing leaflets available so interested people could 
learn more about letterboxing as an additional bonus. You could always make the 
letterboxing stamp by request only if you didn't want it available to the 
general public, or, you could make it available, your choice. Of course 
letterboxers could also add the park date and insignia stamp to their collection 
as a side benefit. (The turtle stamp from the Dry Tortugas is AWESOME!!!)  
I think if someone wrote up a proposal and showed the benefits, ie., increased 
traffic into the park's gift shops, opportunity to have control over the box, 
etc, I think this could be sold to the powers that be. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>An alternative to having the box right next to the 
park date stamp would be setting up something like the Smithsonian box and have 
the park folks knowing that it is located inside the gift shop or a nature 
center. I honestly think they would be more receptive to the idea plugged with 
increased traffic inside park buildings, rather than increased potential damage 
to the park's ecosystems.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I welcome all feedback on this idea!</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I believe that the less said about or to the National Park Service <br/>
the better.  The NPS needs to maintion the right to approve or deny <br/>
anything that goes in their parks to protect them.  We should stay <br/>
away from fragile, historical or especially popular parks.  <br/>
Letterboxes should be hidden in quiet, safe and discrete places <br/>
anyway.  However we all know a few boxes in few obscure, less visited <br/>
parks.  Don't ask don't tell I say.  As long as we all follow the <br/>
guidelines of the LBNA everyone will be happy.  The less we attract <br/>
the attention of the NPS the better for both of us.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxes survive by being a quiet, discrete hobby.  Occasional <br/>
articles catch the attention of those naturally attracted to <br/>
letterboxing but I do not think it would be good to evangelize to the <br/>
masses too much.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been collecting the Nat'l Park passport stamps for a while now. It can be a bit like letterboxing where sometimes the directions to a visitor center are rather vague and you have to ask a ranger where the stamp is. Also, some parks have multiple stamps at different locations within the park. The other tricky thing is that there really is no single comprehensive list of all the stamps that exist - even the publisher of the passports only provides a partial list.<br/>
<br/>
I think you would probably find varying degrees of support for having the visitor centers and park stations storing and providing letterboxes. In smaller parks, I think you might get more support but at more popular tourist destinations like as Alcatraz or Yellowstone I don't think they would be as likely to do this. <br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts...<br/>

p.s. there are also passport stamp programs for National Wildlife Refuges and the US Lighthouse Society! <br/>

That's probably an accurate assessment based on my experiences with <br/>
the local park service personal with parks large and small.  At least <br/>
out in California where I've done volunteer work for Yosemite, <br/>
Sequoia, and Channel Islands National Park.  And let me tell you, the <br/>
bigger and more popular of a tourist destination the park is, the <br/>
more red tape there is, even when you want to VOLUNTEER your work for <br/>
FREE!  Heck, in Yosemite they wouldn't even let us clean out the <br/>
campfire rings in the campgrounds without an official to "watch" us, <br/>
and they couldn't find one to do even that because they were too busy <br/>
herding cattle, errr, tourists around.  So those idiots ended up <br/>
having to do ALL the work themselves which just made more work for <br/>
them in the long run.  Ugh.  I will never, ever volunteer my efforts <br/>
in that park again.  Not worth the effort.<br/>
<br/>
But the Channel Islands--sheeze!  Those park rangers were awesome!  <br/>
They even let us drive their little rescue boats around the islands <br/>
which was a real blast.  =)  When there's only two <br/>
rangers/adminitration officials on the entire island (I was on Santa <br/>
Rosa island), there's not a whole lot of red tape to cut through!<br/>
