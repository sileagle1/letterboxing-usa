<br/>
<br/>
We found Furry Woodland Creature and Christmas Tree Graveyards this <br/>
afternoon, our first time seeking them.  We ran into some other boxers <br/>
(Soulduo and a friend) on the trail of same and temporarily joining <br/>
forces with them. Unfortunately, I'd grabbed the wrong copy of the clues <br/>
before I left home - ie. not the set on which I'd written the Doubtful <br/>
Guests' phone #.  Didn't realize that until we were onsite, so we didn't <br/>
get to meet up with the DGs this round :-&lt; (I met them at Cox Farms last <br/>
year, when they came looking for the box I'd planted there).  Even <br/>
though I grew up in Reston and went to elementary school right near <br/>
those two boxes, I don't remember ever having been in that stretch of <br/>
(very wild) woods.  A wonderful surprise!  And that second Xmas Tree <br/>
stamp is just incredible (though bigger than my stamp pad).<br/>
<br/>
On the way home (driving, people - it's miles! ;-&gt; ), we managed to find <br/>
Audubon #2 of series 1 just fine, exactly where we had been looking on <br/>
Monday.  Really exactly - I'd run my pokey stick over it.  Like Scarab <br/>
said when he e-mailed me in the interim, we'd just missed it by a few <br/>
leaves the first time...<br/>
<br/>
Weather was great; all but Audobon #2 were nice &amp; dry. It wasn't too <br/>
bad.  We put another towel inside Audobon #2 and rushed out of there, <br/>
hiding it well, just about 5pm when the gates were supposed to close (as <br/>
the last out, we closed them). <br/>
<br/>
My girls and I had fun with their "treasure hunt", althrough they got <br/>
pretty cranky the last hour or so of the very long afternoon.  My <br/>
littler one thinks every park marker and sign and post is a clue and <br/>
wants me to read them all to her!  My older one has an idea for her own <br/>
stamp; wish I had one ;-&gt;  Hope to tackle the Doubtful Guests' second <br/>
Audubon (Audobon?) series, also in Reston, sometime soon.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy this nice weather; we're supposed to have a bit more of it before <br/>
TG...<br/>
