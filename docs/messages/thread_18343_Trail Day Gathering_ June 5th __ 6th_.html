The first Saturday in June is National Trails Day. This is an event <br/>
designed to get people out to do trail work, to participate in hikes <br/>
and clinics and become aware of the trails available to them for <br/>
their recreational enjoyment as well as how important it is to <br/>
maintain them.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Mountain Sports has been a part of National Trails Day since <br/>
it began 10 years ago.  The EMS store in Danbury in conjunction with <br/>
The Great American Stamp Store and several dedicated letterboxers <br/>
are planning to host a gathering on June 5th from 10-3 PM.  The CT <br/>
Forest and Parks Association and Eastern Mountain Sports are <br/>
publisizing this event.<br/>
<br/>
Events will include ...<br/>
* a clinic on letterboxing to introduce new people<br/>
* a stamp carving class by Brian of Team GreenDragon<br/>
* carving/letterboxing supplies by The Great American Stamp Store<br/>
* plenty of additional letterboxes on the property and nearby areas<br/>
<br/>
In addition, plans are in the works for camping permits on the <br/>
property.  All those letterboxers who stay for the campfire that <br/>
evening to swap stories and roast smores will also get a special <br/>
event stamp.  All those letterboxers who campout will recieve yet <br/>
another event stamp.  But wait ... there's more ...<br/>
<br/>
Clues to "Things That Go Bump In The Night" will be distributed at <br/>
sunset.  These limited edition letterboxes will only be around from <br/>
sunset to sunrise on June 5th to 6th.  If you have never letterboxed <br/>
at night ... believe me, it is fantastic!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all come from near and far to this wonderful event.  If <br/>
you have some ideas you would like to share for this event feel free <br/>
to drop me an email at: Letterboxer2002@yahoo.com<br/>
