                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>Taking advantage of the very un-autumn-ish weather in Massachusetts today, we all skived off from school to make out first drive out to the eastern end of the state. 
<br/>
<br/>A Tree for All Seasons: As I said, this wasn't an autumnal day, but the tree we found didn't know that. &lt;g&gt; Not too many people have been here yet. It will be interesting to see how many of them go back in three months for the next stamp. I know we'll be there.
<br/>
<br/>Massachusetts Wolf Mystery: Safe and sound. Great clue, nice hike and views. Got to love the mystery boxes! Thanks Lonemasswolf!
<br/>
<br/>Naonet: Ran out of time here. The directions aren't very good, and there were no trail maps to be found at the entrance. We made a game attempt, but simply didn't have enough time to get these three. Since we have to go back for the next season of the tree anyway, we're already planning a return trip, with a trail map, and more time. :-)
