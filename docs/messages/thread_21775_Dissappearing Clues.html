Hello,<br/>
I'm back.Hope you all missed me.<br/>
I can't figure out how the tax men grabbed it but my clues <br/>
dissappeared. I replaced the clues just like I replaced all of those <br/>
baggies and letterboxes.<br/>

Hey Geogeoria,<br/>
<br/>
   I'm still miffed on what clues you are talking about?  Are they <br/>
clues you post on AQ or LbNA?  What are the names of the boxes?  I'm <br/>
sure they weren't pulled or deleted there just may be some SNAFU <br/>
happening.  If they are clues posted to AQ it's a glitch in the system <br/>
that poor Ryan is trying to find.  If the clues were posted to LbNA <br/>
you may want to notify the webmaster, the site was upgraded on April <br/>
30 and maybe they fell through the cracks some how.  <br/>

Oh, I've happily worked through that glitch.  =)<br/>
<br/>

&gt; the site was upgraded on April 30 and maybe they fell through the<br/>
&gt; cracks some how.  <br/>
<br/>
It was a web hosting problem that, last time I checked, they "think"<br/>
is solved.  I e-mailed the webmasters about how it can be fixed<br/>
manually if the hosting service's fix doesn't actually work, though. <br/>
It's suffering the same fate Atlas Quest did yesterday so I already<br/>
got the solution worked out.  =)<br/>
