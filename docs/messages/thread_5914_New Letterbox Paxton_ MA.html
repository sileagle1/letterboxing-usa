Red Newt Letterbox<br/>
Paxton, Massachusetts<br/>
Planted June 28th 2002<br/>
clue difficulty: easy<br/>
terrain: well marked path, muddy in places<br/>
distance: .45 miles from trailhead<br/>
<br/>
 The letterbox is located at Southwick Pond which straddles the<br/>
Paxton/Leicesster town line. From Worcester take Pleasant Street (Rte. 122)<br/>
west to Wallbridge Road in Paxton. Turn left onto Walbridge and drive to the<br/>
end of the road where you will find a small parking area.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Southwick Pond is part of the Greater Worcester Land Trust Tetasset Hills<br/>
Trail system. The parcel is 112 acres of beautiful woodlands with a loop<br/>
trail that is approximately 1 - 1 1/2 miles long. The trail leads to two<br/>
farming ponds connected by a dike. The area is home to migrating swallows,<br/>
whitetail deer, beaver, turtles, woodpeckers and lots of bright orange<br/>
newts. Watch your step! We have seen lots of newts on the trail. At the end<br/>
of June the Mountain Laurel is in bloom and you find yourself in an<br/>
enchanted forest surrounded by white blossoms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enter the trail at the sign. Follow the trail blazed with white markers and<br/>
blue triangles southward until you come to a log and plank boardwalk over a<br/>
small stream. Continue along the trail for another 1/10 of a mile noticing<br/>
the rock walls to your left. When you come to the corner intersection of two<br/>
rock walls there will be a break in the wall 30 paces ahead and another<br/>
trail heading east. Head through the break in the wall and follow this trail<br/>
east. There will be a rock wall on your left. As you walk watch for breaks<br/>
in the rock wall. At the second break leave the path and walk 12 steps on<br/>
the unmarked path to the break. Do not pass through the break. Turn to your<br/>
right (east) and walk 12 steps along the wall. You should end up behind a<br/>
large Mountain Laurel. The box you seek is under some flat stones next to<br/>
the wall. Look for three small stones on top of a larger flat one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After you find the box if you continue along the blue blazed trail you will<br/>
reach Southwick Pond. The trail is a loop that will bring you back to the<br/>
corner intersection of the two rock walls. A trail map can be found at<br/>

Enjoy your visit to this beautiful area.<br/>
