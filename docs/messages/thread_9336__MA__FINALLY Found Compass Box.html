We are soooo excited that we finally found Tehuti's Compass Letterbox at Stanley Park. After 4 tries to no avail, I was determined as ever to find it today, and dragged the gang out. Even my 4 year old said "Oh mom, this box again?".<br/>
<br/>
The compass directions are right on, but be sure to remind yourself to "end up at some sort of landmark". This will help you greatly, even if you end up a few feet away from it, you are probably at the right spot. I hadn't used a compass since high school so I felt rusty, but I guess my skills are still there.<br/>
<br/>
We also found the "One Ring HitchHiker" and it's on it's way to who knows where. Xmas is coming and maybe it'll hitch a ride in Santa's sleigh....speaking of........<br/>
<br/>
Be on the watch for our new Christmas series "Twelve Days of Christmas".Â  This series will only be out from December 12-25....and promises to be as merry as this holiday season.<br/>
<br/>
PS. I'm sure I woke up a few sleeping creatures when I did my victory dance in the middle of the path...did you hear me all the way to your house Tehuti????<br/>
