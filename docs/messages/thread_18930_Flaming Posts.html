                    <div class="plaintext-content">Even after reading some of the history (thanks again to those who have tried to enlighten some of us with that-- and I'm not being sarcastic, I do mean that it is good to know, when I have time to spend on it) it is still quite difficult to understand what the connections are to the current targeting, or whatever it is.  If someone has done nothing to hurt me, and nothing that I understand to be bad or evil or whatever, I am not going to simply join in with a bunch of others who think they have some reason to target the person and spread hate.  I give people a second chance, and often more. No Rayvenhaus has ever done anything that hurt me, and I'm not going to nit-pick at a few words of honest admission to having strong feelings. (i.e. the Nazi reference). If someone takes that personally, ok, so be it.  I think Mr. Rayvenhaus was simply observing that we are all capable of strong feelings, himself included.  I'm not going to get bent out of shape about it.  What I don't understand is the need to post attacks that are meant to lead everyone else towards hatred rather than unity in this community. I'm not here to make enemies or help a group create enemies or pariahs.  Thanks for your words of explanation, Pandora.  --lunaryakketyact<br/>
