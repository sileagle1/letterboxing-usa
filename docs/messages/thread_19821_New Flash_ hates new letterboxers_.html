&gt; If you just review some of the "discussions" on this forum alone <br/>
&gt; you can see how hot things would get if another letterboxer really <br/>
&gt; wanted to let you have it.  I think the text is quite civil, <br/>
actually.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You have to remember one thing about this activity.  It must <br/>
&gt; remain below the radar of the rest of the world.  We can't turn <br/>
&gt; Pro.  A flood of new letterboxers who do not adapt to the (face it, <br/>
&gt; rather odd) culture, threaten to ruin things by the simple act of <br/>
&gt; calling attention to us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It only takes one bad review to turn us all into outlaws.  I can <br/>
see <br/>
&gt; the article now:  A photo of a Rubbermade container, book <br/>
&gt; pages, plastic bags, markers and stamps strewn across an <br/>
&gt; otherwise pristine wooded glen with the headline, <br/>

Oh, yes, we can!  Many of us have been there too!  Not all areas are <br/>
saturated in boxes to find as you begin.  Starting to carve can be <br/>
intimidating, but it is so fun when you get the hang of it!  Keep <br/>
going!  they only get better (oh, and a good tip is to carve away <br/>
from you-I have a few gouges in my hand from slipping :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for commenting thoughtfully.  It appears the feedback to your <br/>
question has been positive.  I agree the comment on planting was well-<br/>
done.  It seems every time we get major publicity, many boxes are <br/>
destroyed by haphazard newbies or strange things creep into the list <br/>
and drive away seasoned LBers.  Unfortunately, there is some <br/>
animosity sometimes between veterans and newbies as a result.  We <br/>
have all been there though and don't want new people to stop coming.  <br/>
We just get afraid sometimes of the impact they will have on an <br/>
activity we love.<br/>
<br/>
best of luck in your new adventures!  You will love it!<br/>

I'm getting over a cold, though, and too woozy to be any more creative than that.  Anyone else want to create the pledge?  Poison Ivy?  You're so good at those things... :)<br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>
