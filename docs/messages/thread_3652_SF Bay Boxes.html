Kim and I went looking for them yesterday.  Our results were the same <br/>
as those of Funhog.  #1 is definitely not there.<br/>

Tiny boxes!  We're used to bigger ones on the East Coast.  We had to <br/>
get creative to fit our big stamps into those little logs.<br/>

First attempt at letterboxing for me and my partner. We've <br/>
successfully found a number of geocaches, but all three of these <br/>
letterboxes eluded us. I guess the clues were just a little too <br/>
indistinct, and we didn't want to spend too much time tromping <br/>
around off the trails. Maybe somebody can point us to <br/>
easier-to-locate letterboxes in the Bay Area?<br/>
