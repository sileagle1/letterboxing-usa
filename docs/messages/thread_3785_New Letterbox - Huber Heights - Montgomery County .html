Near Huber Heights, Montgomery County, Ohio<br/>
Difficulty 2, 1 mile round trip<br/>
Placed 24 November 2001<br/>
<br/>
Long days in the fields behind horse drawn plows and harvesting <br/>
equipment were the essence of farm life in rural Ohio in the 1880's.  <br/>
If I had been a teenage son or a hired hand, my daydreams would have <br/>
gone to fishing the ponds and lakes of the farm.  This letterbox <br/>
gives you the chance to experience just that same daydream.<br/>
<br/>
On the north side of Dayton, north of I 70 and east of SR 201 is the <br/>
Carriage Hill MetroPark.   900 acres of rolling farmland surround a <br/>
working 1880 farm with draft animals, a blacksmith, and a well <br/>
appointed farm house with volunteers in period costume.  It is a <br/>
great afternoon outing for a family, open year round.  <br/>
<br/>
The visitor's center is worth a look, as are the farm buildings.  A <br/>
map of the park showing the trails is available (free) in the <br/>
visitor's center.  It may also be available in the picnic areas at <br/>
the head of trails but these boxes were empty in November of 2001.  <br/>
<br/>
For the letterbox, walk across the road from the Farm/Visitors center <br/>
or park in the small lot at the Red Wing Picnic Shelter.  Take the <br/>
boardwalk across the wetland area while looking for redwing <br/>
blackbirds.  At the far end of the boardwalk take the path along the <br/>
lake (heading 140 deg) for 85 paces where it branches.  (1 pace = 2 <br/>
steps)  Take the left path and continue across a number of cross <br/>
paths in the woods and grass prairie following a course near enough <br/>
to 60 deg until you arrive at the south end of the dam for North <br/>
Woods Pond.  Cross the dam (34 paces) and then take the path at 60 <br/>
degrees for 17 paces.  Several paces to your right you will see a <br/>
standing stump on the lakeshore about 10 feet tall.  <br/>
<br/>
The Carriage Hill letterbox is in the heart of that stump, under a <br/>
couple pieces of wood and bark, and reached from the side facing the <br/>
lake. <br/>
