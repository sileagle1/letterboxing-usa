surrounded by LETTERBOXING and "NOT ALL WHO WANDER ARE LOST" ?  That pretty <br/>
much says it all and should be intriguing enough to get people to ask about <br/>
it.  Isn't that the point anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Patches are ok but I like stickers as they tend to get around more; not <br/>
being limited to clothing or packs.<br/>

Count me out of the recognition and numbers discussion.  I just don't see <br/>
the point in awards and "rankings" in this kind of hobby--it seems so <br/>
British and heierarchic.  I just want to have fun and see more boxes put out <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Someone recently sent me a letter that mentioned leaning away from placing <br/>
urban boxes because they are vulnerable.  To popularize the sport I think <br/>
some boxes accessable on an afternoon outing are needed and I intend to <br/>
plant at least a couple in the Portland, OR area.<br/>

I loved this phrase...<br/>
"NOT ALL WHO WANDER ARE LOST"<br/>
<br/>
Would make a great bumper sticker - just that phrase, and underneath <br/>
www.letterboxing.org.  Now that's a bumper sticker I wouldn't mind seeing! Much <br/>
more so that "My karma ran over my dogma" or "Visualize whirled peas." If I see <br/>
those more time, I may succumb to bumper sticker rage...<br/>

<br/>
Very true! Last weekend I hunted 2 boxes placed in nature preserves in an urban <br/>
neighborhood (Belmont, MA), and it added to the thrill to be finding a box <br/>
stashed under a rock with houses and traffic nearby.  Of course, I think you've <br/>
got to be discreet removing and re-hiding the box or you risk having it be <br/>
vandalized.  I also have found two that were hidden right downtown in Woodstock, <br/>
VT - so, I think urban boxes CAN be done, though there will always be a risk.<br/>

Unfortunately, some (perhaps an insignifcant minority :-)) may perceive <br/>
it as a bit cliche and a ripoff of Tolkien (unless it is ack'ed).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I definitely agree. I have no interest in awards and recognition, but I can see<br/>
&gt; the appeal for others.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;To popularize the sport I think<br/>
<br/>
Awards and recognition will help popularize the hobby.  Whether or not you<br/>
wish to attract the sort of people attracted to awards and recognition is<br/>
another issue altogether.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, the hobby is British.  Its ironic that in a hobby where there<br/>
is so much emphasis on collecting things, and in particular being first<br/>
to new boxes (I've seen in alot of notes in boxes I have found the proud<br/>
exclamation from the first one to stamp), that there is no desire to <br/>
collect these sorts of things too.  Certainly not contradictory, but <br/>
interesting, and in a way, charming (let the recognition live in the<br/>
field sort of thing -- it does have a certain charm to it).<br/>
<br/>
PS, I have placed another mystery box, clues will be on-line within<br/>
the week, the muses willing :-)<br/>

<br/>
Just wanted to speak up and mention that I can provide a photo-ready <br/>
electronic vector (or bitmap) illustration of the LbNA logo if we were to <br/>
adopt that as the official recognition badge design.  I intended to try to <br/>
locate a company that could provide a quote for something of this nature a <br/>
while back back, but got too involved with my classwork again to follow <br/>
through. (I know I said I wouldn't do it again, but I'm taking another <br/>
overloaded schedule this semester...27 credit hours!!) Of course, I'm open to <br/>
all other ideas as well, but I do like the idea of using the logo, because of <br/>
all it represents....<br/>
<br/>
Many of you will recognize that the current LbNA logo is actually a <br/>
conglomeration of a whole bunch of different ideas that were submitted to <br/>
this list by various members of our group (with special effort put forth by <br/>
Michelle, in particular) last year.<br/>
<br/>
The colors green and blue are symbolic of the plants and water features that <br/>
beautify the trails and natural areas that house most of our letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
The logo was intentionally designed to work well as a rubber stamp, the <br/>
calling card of our hobby.<br/>
<br/>
The font used for the L and the B (and the word Letterboxing, in the larger <br/>
version) is reminiscent of the runic, Anglo, Tolkien, Middle-Earth charm and <br/>
romance that is an underlying theme for many of our letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, the N and A are arranged to resemble the needle of a compass <br/>
pointing North.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of my classwork, I want to express my gratitude for everyone's <br/>
patience lately. I'm thankful that we have this list so we can exchange clues <br/>
that I've not had time to add to the Web site recently. The good news is that <br/>
I am graduating in June and should have more opportunities for letterboxing <br/>
activities afterward, both on-line and on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, everyone!!<br/>

Hooraay - Welcome back!  It is great to hear your (on-line) voice again. <br/>
I for one have been very happy with the current LBNA logo and would<br/>
continue to be so with it as a patch, decal, or whatwever (actually,<br/>
BOTH).<br/>
