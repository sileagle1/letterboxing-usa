                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you all for your ideas, suggestions, and empathy.  I am so touched by the support and ideas of the letterboxing community - this is what I love about my hobbies.  Good people. :)  I am very fortunate!  I really appreciate all of the kind offers and am amazed at how this got everybody thinking about their experiences.  I think we can all relate to things on a personal level  whether weve experienced something similar or not.  And if my story helps others to prevent such a trauma, then it is worth sharing.<br/>
<br/>
  I am thankful for all of the suggestions and just bought a new fanny pack!  Now to dig up my carving tools, hit the clues, and plan ahead for my "restart".<br/>
<br/>
  As for the Boo Boo Box, I humbly accept! J<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you all for your kind words - may you, your logbooks and stamps be safe!<br/>
  Happy Hunting!<br/>
