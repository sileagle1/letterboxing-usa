Woodchucks and Diana'a Legend.  Great Stamps and we picked up the En <br/>
Garde H.H.  I love the quote on the inside cover "The Lord will fight <br/>
for you; you need only be still...".  Went off to Columbia and did <br/>
the Gazebo, Hop River Trail East, and Mom's Birthday Box.  All box <br/>
are in great shape and the stamps are nice.  Went to Hebron and did <br/>
Small's Bear's Birthday, Peggy Dow, I Rather Be Letterboxing Series.  <br/>
Off to Marlborough and did Marlborough Tavern, Old Methodist Church, <br/>
(wasn't able to do the other Church box, didn't realize until getting <br/>
out there that it can't be done until after 6:00 on weekdays, next <br/>
time we read the clues all the way first.)Eagle Eyes, Salmon River <br/>
State Box, and Red Hat.  Plus some bonus boxes that I won't name. Oh <br/>
and the Gazebo in Hebron.  Great day, Great Boxes, and Great <br/>
Carvings!!!  Teach &amp; Preach<br/>
