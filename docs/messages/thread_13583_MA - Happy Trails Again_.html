                    <div class="plaintext-content">Set the alarm and was out of the house at 5:30 am to snag as many <br/>
letterboxes as I could before noon.  Six full hours of letterboxing - <br/>
in the sunshine, to boot!  I am *such* a happy camper!<br/>
<br/>
Remembering Solor's report earlier, I came packed with replacement <br/>
supplies.<br/>
<br/>
Lime Kiln - It's a good thing that I am not Indiana Jones.  The "hot <br/>
spot" was covered, and I do mean *covered* with garter snakes, <br/>
sunning themselves.  I had to gracefully shoo along about a dozen to <br/>
get to the letterbox.  I replaced the inkpad.<br/>
<br/>
On the way to Bolton Quarry - I took one small wrong turn and <br/>
discovered an "undocumented feature".  I scaled a sheer roots and <br/>
boulders cliff only to discover - no more trail.  I did take <br/>
advantage of the opportunity to sit and gaze at an algae pond below.  <br/>
I'm so glad I took that wrong turn!<br/>
<br/>
Bolton Quarry - I stamped three impressions of this stamp into my <br/>
logbook to remind me of the poison ivy!  I replaced the ink pad and <br/>
the pen.<br/>
<br/>
Whitcomb Garrison - I was laughing hysterically when I realized that <br/>
I was pulling into the driveway of one of my best friend's house!  <br/>
This letterbox is on her front lawn!  Of course I took advantage of a <br/>
coffee break.  I also replaced the ink pad in this box.<br/>
<br/>
Time to Go Fishin' - My very first "first find"!  There was no pen in <br/>
the box, so I put one there.  This trail literally hugs the shore of <br/>
the reservoir, on a trail that is cut into the side of a steep steep <br/>
hill.  The best part about searching for this letterbox was the one <br/>
small misstep that I took - which sent me sliding down about 10 feet <br/>
worth of mud and plop! right into the water!  I laughed like a loon.  <br/>
That was fun!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Birthday - I would have to describe this one as "the good, the <br/>
bad, and the ugly.  Followed the clues to the correct spot.  The <br/>
clues lead you to believe that the letterbox was hidden in or around <br/>
an ancient stone wall next to a dead tree.  I found the spot, and <br/>
stopped in sheer horror.  An approximately five foot section of that <br/>
ancient rock wall was completely disassembled and strewn all about <br/>
the place.  I no longer cared about finding the letterbox (which I <br/>
didn't).  It's a good thing that I go to the gym, because it took me <br/>
about 45 minutes to try to reassemble the rock wall as best as I <br/>
could guess to its original appearance.  Lichen side up, overlapping <br/>
rocks where there were clear overlap marks.  Several bright orange <br/>
slugs watched me work which cheered me up.  I finally finished, and <br/>
got down on my knees in front of the wall, silently apologizing to <br/>
it.  Then, from behind me, about 10 feet behind me, I heard a very <br/>
loud, very deep "chuff".  I froze, remembering all the dog stories.  <br/>
My mace was in the front pocket of my bib overalls.  I slipped it out <br/>
and unfastened the safety.  I sloooowly turned around - and came eye <br/>
to eye with the most beautiful deer I have ever seen.  Absolutely <br/>
gorgeous.  We stared at each other for nearly five minutes (can you <br/>
believe it?) before the deer gave another "chuff" (? goodbye) and <br/>
bounded off deeper into the forest.  Absolutely breathtaking.<br/>
<br/>
So here I am, muddy, wet, bloody knuckles and elbows, three broken <br/>
fingernails, a bazillion mosquito bites, and a crop of poison ivy <br/>
soon to erupt (I just know it).<br/>
<br/>
AND I AM ECSTATICALLY HAPPY!  I love letterboxing.<br/>
