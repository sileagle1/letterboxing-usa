The Great Lakes message group is still very active!  I've sent a copy of your message directly to the owner of the board.  She will probably be able to figure out what the problem is.  When you tried to subscribe to the list, did you put a reason for wanting to join?  If you left it blank, I think it might be assumed to be spam and that might be the problem.<br/>
