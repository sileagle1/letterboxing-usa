                    <div class="plaintext-content">LbNA is not a secret society.  Most people want other LBers to <br/>
recognize that they, too, are a LBer so that they can stamp into each <br/>
others' books.  These are the exchanges you hear about and that you <br/>
see recorded in people's PFX counts (placed-found-exchanged).  We have <br/>
organized Meets and Greets where we exchange stamp images.<br/>
<br/>
But there are no rules.  You are completely free to keep your name and <br/>
stamp secret.  Or maybe you would want to carve a different stamp for <br/>
purposes of an exchange.  It's up to you!<br/>

FYI for newbies, this is called a "traveler".  Elsewhere, they would<br/>

Lately I have met some "old time" L'boxers that carry travelers. But <br/>
you have to remember to ask. <br/>

 Appledumpling Gang has a stuffed animal(creature) that has it's own <br/>
backpack and stamp. His/it's name is Fez. You have to ask to receive. <br/>
Very Cool!<br/>
