letterbox clues:<br/>
<br/>
Many folks, burdened with the cumbersome ordeal of working for a <br/>
living (imagine!), often find just barely enough time to get onto <br/>
the internet and print a handful of clues when they discover they <br/>
are able to enjoy a leisurely stroll in a letterboxing area.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine how much more time it would take to weigh the pros and cons <br/>
of a letterbox review in addition to the multiple letterboxing sites <br/>
that now exist.<br/>
<br/>
Then there's the inevitable disagreement in taste, which of course <br/>
is subjective to the boxer. (How many times have you seen a movie <br/>
that was absolute poo, but it got a great review or a friend raved <br/>
about it?)<br/>
<br/>
With just a little bit of digging one would find THE established <br/>
P.I. Letterbox Rating System.<br/>
<br/>
It has been universally agreed upon by the L.O.R.D.s (Letterboxers <br/>
of Regal Descent) as the standard for all letterboxes. (If you don't <br/>
know who the L.O.R.D.s are, then you probably are not one.)<br/>
<br/>
All that being established and said, there will be many differing <br/>
views of where a letterbox would fall in the rating system. <br/>
<br/>
With the individual review, there will be many, many conflicting <br/>
ratings of "This is the BEST box EVER" when we all know there can be <br/>
only one.<br/>
<br/>
There will also be many, many hurt feelings from poor reviews <br/>
of "Worst box EVER!" There can also be only one of those. Imagine <br/>
your dismay at a poor review, when there really was another box that <br/>
was worse!)<br/>
<br/>
So, to save your valuable time - so you won't have to read <br/>
EVERYONE's disagreeing reviews of EVERY box, I volunteer to receive <br/>
and tally nominations for the various extremes and will publish the <br/>
Best and Worst EVER boxes quarterly - so you won't have to bother <br/>
with those boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Please reply (just to me) with your private nominations for the <br/>
following categories.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A) Best Stamp<br/>
B) Best Logbook<br/>
C) Best Clues<br/>
D) Best Letterboxer<br/>
E) Overall Best Letterbox Ever<br/>
<br/>
1) Crappiest Stamp.<br/>
2) Crappiest Logbook.<br/>
3) Crappiest Clues.<br/>
4) Crappiest Letterboxer.<br/>
5) Overall Crappiest Letterbox Ever<br/>
