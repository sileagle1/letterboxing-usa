last left in the Mutant Swamp Frog box. Can anyone<br/>
verify that for us? We have been trying to get a report<br/>
on this HH for some time. Does anyone know it's whereabouts?<br/>
Don't forget that October is National Breast Cancer Awareness month.<br/>
Early detection is the only hope for many women. There is a small<br/>
percentage of men who are also candidates for Breast Cancer.<br/>
Again, if anyone has info on this HH can contact us we would<br/>
really appreciate it. <br/>
Thank you - TeamGreenDragon <br/>

&gt; I went to Bristol to check on my grandson Will's (now Warp) Soccer <br/>

quite <br/>
&gt; wet (again) so with his permission I took what was left of it and <br/>
&gt; have removed it from the list. Thanks to all who patronized it and <br/>
&gt; there were many (we checked it often). <br/>
&gt; On the last page of the log book there was a note which said:<br/>
&gt;        Your other box was destroyed by idiots. We found<br/>
