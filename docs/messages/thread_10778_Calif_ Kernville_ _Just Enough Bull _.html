Kernville and the surrounding area had an early history of a fairly open and wild place.  Miners, cowboys, Indians, and farmers were just some of the early inhabitants and sometimes things got a bit dicey when certain folks couldn't get along.  Now the wild west times are celebrated mid February every year as the little town swells with visitors seeking a taste yester year.  Mock gunfights are staged in the streets,  there is a parade, rodeo, eats and treats booths, carnival and bands all blend together for a delightful slice of old California.  The townsfolk of little Kernville work hard to put on a great party .for the young and young at heart.  Yahoo!.<br/>
<br/>
Besides all the "Kick up your heels" goings on, Kernville has an educational side too.  The Historical Society  gives talks and welcomes visitors to the Museum. The outdoors beckon you to put your boots on and explore the beautiful valley with walks along the river, the high country or just sauntering through town in search of "Just Enough Bull".<br/>
<br/>
Our adventure starts at a favorite place, Cheryl's Diner in Kernville.  Drop on in for a cup of Joe or a hearty meal and ready your pencil to decipher the clues (our thanks to Ryan, ala, Run for the Border).<br/>
