                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi. We found 3 of the 5 boxes at Fab Four. "The Beatles" and "John" <br/>
were pretty straightforward, and we had to hunt a bit to find <br/>
"George," but we had trouble with the clues for "Paul" and "Ringo." We <br/>
want to go back and complete the band, so does anyone know if they are <br/>
still there? We were pretty tired by the end so that might have been <br/>
part of our problem.<br/>
<br/>
There were no trail maps in the box when we got there, so we tried to <br/>
copy the posted one, which wasn't easy. The things we had trouble with <br/>
were figuring out which geodetic marker Paul was near- we found two <br/>
markers, #s 2 &amp; 3, but never saw #1. Stone wall identification was an <br/>
issue near the two we found. And we also couldn't definitively locate <br/>
the cleft rock that's near Ringo.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.      Curious Crane and Latte Man<br/>
