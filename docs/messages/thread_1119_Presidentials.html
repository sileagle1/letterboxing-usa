Hope you have a great time. The weather forecast is not ideal, though <br/>
not terrible. What route are you taking and where are you staying?<br/>

I don't, simply don't, believe this. You are hiking up and down the <br/>
west side of Washington, without going to Tuckerman's Ravine and <br/>
scoring a First with Bob &amp; Judy's box? Or are you assuming that <br/>
Evelyn and Debbie have already chalked that up and it's not worth <br/>
the effort?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry! Just kidding.<br/>
<br/>
If you are doing this all in one day, which is certainly possible but <br/>
ambitious, you don't have a whoe lot of options as far as camping. <br/>
Definitely too late to arrange for lodging at Lakes, which is <br/>
expensive anyway.<br/>
<br/>
If you drive a little farther and approach Washington from the east <br/>
side, starting at Pinkham Notch, you could go up the Tuckerman's <br/>
Ravine Trail (nabbing the box), and maybe stay the night at the <br/>
Hermit Lake shelter there. The next day you could continue up and <br/>
come down via Lions Head or Boote Spur.<br/>
<br/>
Harvard cabin is another option for that first night. You could go <br/>
up via Lions Head the next day and come back by Tuckerman's Ravine <br/>
Trail.<br/>
<br/>
Phone Reservations at Pinkham Notch to find out about the <br/>
availability of space at Hermit Lake or Harvard Cabin.<br/>
<br/>
I'm off very early tomorrow morning for a funeral in Delaware :-(( <br/>
and letterboxing in NJ &amp; PA :-))))))))<br/>
<br/>
So I probably won't be able to message you again. Have a great trip!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Hey Tom,<br/>
&gt;     We will be hiking up the Jewel Trail, then returning on the Amanoosuc<br/>
&gt; Ravine Trail, passing Lake of the Clouds hut along the way.  It will be my<br/>
&gt; first time up!  Dan, however hiked the mountain a few times as a child.  We<br/>
&gt; have no idea where we are staying though.  We decided last weekend, too late<br/>
&gt; to reserve at the State Campgrounds, so we are leaving after lunch and<br/>
&gt; hoping to find a good place to camp.  Any suggestions??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
