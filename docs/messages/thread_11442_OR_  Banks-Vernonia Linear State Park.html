<br/>
John and I headed West this past weekend and collected six of the<br/>
letterboxes hiding on the Banks-Vernonia Rails to Trails park.  We<br/>
forgot to carry-on to Horseshoe after Fallen Feather and The Minstrel's<br/>
letterbox in the Travelling Circus' New Year 2003 series eluded us.  We<br/>
had a great time and added 6 to our <br/>
"F" count. <br/>
<br/>
This trail has always been considered the backYARDS of Oregon, more than<br/>
the backWOODS of Oregon as far as I was concerned, but with letterboxes<br/>
on it -- WHAT FUN!!!  We are hoping to go back again and ride our bikes<br/>
to find the two we missed out on sometime in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much to Brett, Penny and Grace and the Travelling Circus for<br/>
planting such wonderful letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

come back out if you don't already have that one. <br/>
<br/>
I don't recall The Minstrel's box being particularly hard although I <br/>
did goof the clue on the way out but quickly realized my error and <br/>
got it on the way back after getting the other boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you got to see some trilliums - I noticed they just started <br/>
coming up in the B-V area last week. <br/>
