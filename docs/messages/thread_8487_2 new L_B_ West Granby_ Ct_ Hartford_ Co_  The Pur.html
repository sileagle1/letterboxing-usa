<div>I never saw a Purple Cow,</div>
<div>I never hope to see one;</div>
<div>But I can tell you, anyhow,</div>
<div>I'd rather see than be one.</div>

<div>Planted by Rubaduc on 10-18-02</div>
<div>For the two best friends a Duck could have. One who introduced me to 
letterboxing and one who led me to Enders State Forest.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Very easy walk, 45 min. for the boxes. Forever if you meander down to the 
falls.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Purple Cow was supposed to reside at Holcomb Farm in West Granby since 
that seems to be a letterboxing paradise, but he got away and kept going West on 
Rt. 20 for a little way until he turned south onto Rt. 219. When he saw an 
Enders State Forest sign on the left, he turned into the parking lot and started 
looking for a hiding place.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Head S.W. through the brown gate and follow a gravel path down to an 
intersection, turn left on a wide path following the brook. If you go straight 
ahead instead of left, you'll see the first of many waterfalls. These trails 
aren't marked so stay on the main wide path for letterboxing, for absolute 
beauty take a few right trails, most of which lead to a waterfall, the largest 
can be seen from the trail so keep watching to your right.</div>
<div>After a glimpse of the largest waterfall you'll start downhill, but it's 
not too steep (easy walk back up) walking over a metal culvert pipe part way 
down. About 10 min. down the trail you'll see some baby evergreens growing up in 
the middle of the path, a fallen tree to duck under and then a stream or stream 
bed, depending on water supply. At the edge of the stream turn around, heading 
back the way you came and up the hill, behind the tree at 260 degrees, under 
letterboxing rocks is the Dance Like Nobody's watching Letterbox. Stamp in... 
rehide carefully, I don't think anybody will be watching at this point.</div>
<div>Go back to the place where you entered the wide path, passing the trail to 
your car. Cross one little stream to follow the brook as the path narrows. The 
main brook soon veers left and you'll be following a smaller stream until it 
curves to the right and crosses your path. At this point you can see the 
guardrails on the road above you and a large boulder on your right. To the right 
side of the boulder the Purple Cow Letterbox waits to be found. Now you've seen 
a Purple Cow.</div>
<div>Follow stamping procedures being careful not to be seen, there may be 
fishing people here. Retrace your steps back to your car and thank you for 
letterboxing.</div>
