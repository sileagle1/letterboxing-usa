<br/>
Recently, I read that there was suppose to be some sort of a New <br/>
Jersey social group being put together for letterboxing.  I do not <br/>
mean the gathering that is scheduled in 2 weeks, but a real group for <br/>
southerjersians to go letterbox together??  Did anything ever <br/>
transpire from this??  I am *ReallY* interested in this if anyone can <br/>
supply some info.<br/>
<br/>
Also, speaking of the gathering who all is thinking of attending??  I <br/>
am trying really hard to schedule that day off from work, but I do <br/>
not know yet.  Maybe if I do happen to get the day off we could meet <br/>
and go together.  How's that??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy 'lboxing to you,<br/>

I believe the group you are talking about is the Perfect Circle <br/>
Letterboxing Guild. Here's a link http://www.pcdx.com/pclg/.  Their <br/>
latest news is from July 2003 and it says "No news is good news, so <br/>
we have good news...."  The last news before that was from March <br/>
2002. I'm thinkin' that maybe they're kind of non-existant now. You <br/>
could try contacting them though.<br/>
<br/>
Myself and the rest of Team PresSinOn will be at the NJ gathering <br/>
next weekend. We can't wait!  :)<br/>
<br/>
See ya there maybe,<br/>
