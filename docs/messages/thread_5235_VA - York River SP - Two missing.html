My recollection is that the original York River Box #1 was recently <br/>
replaced by Jay (Jolly G-Man) for Squirrel.  You can check the clue <br/>
page for specifics on that replacement.  <br/>
<br/>
I was happy to hear that a recent boxer found all four of the <br/>
Pocohontas boxes about which I'd received missing reports.  In fact, <br/>
I was recently in the Park to check on Princess Pocahontas/Chief <br/>
Powhatan and John Smith, and had trouble finding them myself!!!<br/>

We were at York River State Park yesterday and box #1 is alive and <br/>
kicking!  It was a bit damp inside, but the logbook and stamp are <br/>
fine.<br/>
