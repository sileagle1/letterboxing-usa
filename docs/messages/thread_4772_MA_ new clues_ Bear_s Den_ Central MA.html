<div>We, Bob and Ginger, planted this box today on our way home from 
Amherst.  For anyone headed out towards the Mohawk Trail getting 
to this beautiful area would be a short diversion and well worth the 
time.</div>
<div> </div>
<div align="center">Bear's Den</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Clue difficulty: easy</div>
<div>Terrain: hilly, at times rock cliffs near path</div>
<div>Distance: 3/4 mi. round trip</div>
<div>Planted: 3/24/02</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To get to Bear's Den take Route 2 to Route 202 south.  2 miles down 
202 you will pass the intersection of Route 122 in New Salem.  Continue on 
202 for another .4 mile and take a right onto Elm Street. Follow Elm St. for .7 
mile and take a left onto Neilson Rd.  Look for the Trustees of 
Reservations signpost at .5 mile down Neilson Rd.  Unfortunately, only the 
post remains with only a couple of fragments of the Trustees sign left 
hanging on the post. Park on the roadside by the signpost . As soon as you step 
onto the trail you will notice a sign that relates the history of this 
parcel.  It is thought that King Philip met here with his warriors during 
King Philip's War.  The name "Bear's Den"  has a much less auspicious 
origin as it recalls the shooting of a black bear by an early settler in 
the area.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Follow the trail downhill toward the Swift River.  You will 
notice a rock foundation of an old gristmill on your right. Continue on down 
toward the river. Just before you reach the river a trail heads uphill to your 
left.  Follow this trail to the top of a knoll which will give you a 
towering view of a waterfall.  Continue climbing up along the cliffside, 
the river to your right.  You'll find yourself in an enchanting forest of 
hemlocks.  You may notice  a small tree trunk pocked with several 
large holes carved by a pileated woodpecker. Watch out for other signs of 
animal life as you follow the path getting close by the river's edge.  Soon 
you will have to pass under a large tree trunk that extends over the water, it's 
top broken off.  Here you will see a large stone wall just ahead and to 
your left.  Continue straight ahead passing between two trees, a large oak 
hugging the stone wall on your left and a hemlock grabbing the riverbank on your 
right.  Turn left and take eight or nine paces along the path following the 
stone wall. Face the wall.   Step four paces to the wall brushing 
past a small hemlock on your right.  The bear is in his den hiding 
behind a long pointed stone lying at the base of the stone wall. </div>
