What an absolutely awesome letterboxing event!!!  Thank you everyone <br/>
for planning such an incredibly fun couple of days!  Special thanks <br/>
to the Paisley Orca and Funhog for securing such a perfect location <br/>
for a LB gathering!!!  We lend additional applause to all those <br/>
wonderful people who planted such incredible boxes for the event--<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Funhog's exquisite event stamp<br/>
Heather's Jurassic Park Series--great dinosaurs, inspired rnrB to <br/>
ask all sorts of interesting questions like 'where are the dinosaurs <br/>
today?', uh...dunno, 'why did they die?', uh....dunno--they <br/>
smoked?, ... boy, do I have some research to do...<br/>
Wild Woman's Making Faces--such a sweet series, the kids LOVED it<br/>
Wizbang's Mini Cooper--great great stamp<br/>
The Minstrel's Sunburst--gorgeous, as always, stamp!<br/>
Springchick via Funhog--love'd MI(Lo)!!!  ;)<br/>
Brett, Penny, Grace and baby 2 be via Funhog--cutest lb concept <br/>
we've ever seen--trkr REALLY wanted it!<br/>
Paisley Orca's Stamp Camp Stamp--truly an artistic great<br/>
L'ger's OM--what a ravishing beauty!!!<br/>
AND all the cool roving event, traveler &amp; hitchhiking stamps that <br/>
attended, too!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for such a wonderful time &amp; a great opportunity to actually <br/>
get to put names &amp; faces together with their respective lb trail <br/>
names!  Life doesn't get much better than that!  The camping/roving <br/>
letterboxing weekend format worked exceptionally well and enabled <br/>
multiple folks to attend who, otherwise for various reasons, would <br/>
not have been able to attend AND it gave the folks who overnited the <br/>
opportunity to really get to know the other boxers in the region!  <br/>
How cool!<br/>
<br/>
Take care &amp; see you on the trails in the future....<br/>

That was certainly my experience last November in the South Puget <br/>
Sound, Washington region!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your Fall Gathering!  ;)  I know it's lovely--I spent many <br/>
years in the area while in college &amp; when I was really little!<br/>

out next year.  I love that area and it's close enough that I can drive it.<br/>
I'm always up for a trip that direction.  If there's ever one near Ashland<br/>
(a bit further south) I will have to go.  I have family out there that I<br/>
really ought to see, and it is a beautiful little town.<br/>
