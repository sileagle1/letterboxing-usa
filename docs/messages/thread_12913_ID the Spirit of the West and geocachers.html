I stopped by The Spirit of the West today to check up on it.  It is the first letterbox I found, but alas it is missing!  I waited around to see if anyone might return it, but they didn't.  I hope it isn't MIA. I will check back later to see if it was returned.  A-bear, email me and if it is missing. I will be happy to help reinstate it for you.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect I know where it has gone.  By coincidence, there is a geocache hidden 2-3 feet from the letterbox.  There were several letters in the geocache log that referenced finding the letterbox.  The box was hidden in a place that I highly doubt anyone would have chanced upon if they weren't searching.  I wonder if a new cacher that didn't get the rules kept it?  We'll have to alter the location a bit if we replant it.  <br/>
