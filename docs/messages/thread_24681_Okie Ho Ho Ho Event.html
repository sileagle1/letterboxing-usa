Christmas it was going to be, there might be others from the big list <br/>
who might be traveling our direction.  Let's see if I can get all the <br/>
info down this time, **shaking head**  If y'all are going to be in <br/>
the area, we'd love to see ya!!!<br/>
<br/>
December 22<br/>
December gathering for Okie boxers and friends. Everyone welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Would love to see lots of new faces!!<br/>
10 am to 2 pm<br/>
<br/>
Location is:<br/>
The Child Care Resource Center<br/>
18 N Norwood<br/>
Tulsa<br/>
Admiral and Sheridan, across from Church's chicken<br/>
(from Admiral Pl and Sheridan, go West until you get to Norwood,<br/>
about a block, which is the first South)<br/>
<br/>
The Center is there on your right between Admiral Pl. and Admiral<br/>
Blvd.<br/>
In the conference room<br/>
Park in the South parking area and the door is the last door (closest<br/>
to the school across the street)<br/>
(mucho gracias to Tulsagal for finding and confirming this great<br/>
location!!)<br/>
**clapping with standing ovation!**<br/>
<br/>
We'll be having a pot luck lunch, so bring a snack to share with<br/>
everyone!<br/>
(finger sandwiches, meatballs, little smokies, tortilla rolls, etc.,<br/>
anything you think we'll like. You know, all the yummies!!)<br/>
<br/>
I'll supply the plates, napkins, cups, eating utensils and drinks.<br/>
<br/>
I'm so looking forward to seeing everyone again, and meeting new<br/>
friends too!!<br/>
<br/>
Box on!<br/>
