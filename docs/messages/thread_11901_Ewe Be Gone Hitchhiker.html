I was planning on keeping the new home a secret but when I discovered the box had only seen 5 or 6 visitors since 1999, I figured that announcing the location might spur some interest in this beautiful location.<br/>

The Ewe is now grazing on the beautiful green slopes of Mugu Peak in Southern California.<br/>

I'm so happy to hear about this Letterbox (Magu Peak, I assume)--I <br/>
didn't see it listed on the LBNA Website.  I don't live so far from <br/>
this location, but might have shied away from this LB because of its <br/>
age.  I've had some bad experiences with older LBs lately, and would <br/>
hate to take a 4 hour hike with nothing to show for it (okay, I <br/>
would've had a lovely hike, but still...).  Now that I know the LB is <br/>
still there, I'll make the trip in the next couple of weeks; of <br/>
course, I'm sure your Hitchhiker will be gone by then.<br/>
