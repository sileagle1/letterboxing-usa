                    <div class="plaintext-content">Was in Tampa, FLA on business this week, and took an afternoon to visit the<br/>
Hillsborough River State Park. Nice place.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, my real motivation was to find the 2 letterboxes hidden there. No<br/>
dice.<br/>
<br/>
The "River Run" box is definitely missing. There was nothing there but an<br/>
empty Zip Loc bag.<br/>
<br/>
The Christmas #2 box is likely missing as well. I'm a little less sure about<br/>
whether or not I was in the right spot for this, but it is definitely worth<br/>
the placer checking it out next time he's in the area.<br/>
<br/>
A VERY frustrating afternoon!<br/>
