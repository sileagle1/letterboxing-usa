Pretty soon you will start seeing "good places to hide a box"<br/>
<br/>
If you liked those two boxes, go visit again and get her Four <br/>
Elementals.  The hike is about 5 miles round trip and zips right <br/>
along.<br/>
<br/>
Mischief is a bit overwhelmed lately.  I did not find her clues <br/>
posted on her own web site or on the national web site.  Here is a <br/>
link to the IALC site and you can find clues to 4 more boxes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ialc-list/messages/2277?viscount=-30<br/>
<br/>
There are fun easy boxes all around and some harder ones that will <br/>
likely give you more challenges.  The venue at Fort Steilacoom where <br/>
we had our event early in November can offer at least 20 boxes of <br/>
varied level of challenge.  Some of the clues are posted on the main <br/>
site some are archived here in the msg board ( check around October <br/>
331 thru Nov 4 for clues.)  The Web Master is working hard to catch <br/>
up on the washington state home page.<br/>
