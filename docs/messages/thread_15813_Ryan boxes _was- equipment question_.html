Finding the starting point is fun.  I have a lead or two.  We shall see.<br/>
Blast that Ryan! :-) (tongue in cheek, that is) I am determined to be the<br/>
first finder.  Unless someone has found it already and not told Ryan that<br/>
is.  His boxes make me smile, but luckily, I haven't hit truly sadistic ones<br/>
yet.<br/>

Unless, of course, you attempt to tackle Ryan of Portland's infamous<br/>
&amp; sadistic Applegate Trail Rest Area Letterbox near Grants Pass,<br/>
Oregon.  Then, you'll need a several thousand dollar nuclear powered<br/>
military lensatic compass with laser guided precision, a GPS for<br/>
back up accuracy, a full flood light since your hunt will take you<br/>
well into the night regardless of when you begin &amp; numerous<br/>
bottles/tubes of Zanfel/Technu for the almost assured miserable case<br/>
of poison oak you'll catch when you give up 'dead reckoning' the<br/>
various azimuths in the clues and then you surrender to the hunt &amp;<br/>
peck method of finding the letterbox!  Truly sadistic, he is...<br/>

Hmmm...maybe that's why he's spent the entire summer on the East<br/>
Coast tackling the AT--he's trying to get out of firing range from<br/>
us frustrated Ryan box seekers...  Fortunately, we can now say that<br/>
we've found every single Ryan LB that we've sought--granted, a<br/>
couple took multiple attempts, but we've eventually found them!  Ah,<br/>
the sense of accomplishment...  ;)<br/>

&gt; For a compass, I find, you don't need anything too fancy for<br/>
letterboxing. I <br/>
&gt; recommend a Silva Brand model (there are many). You don't need to<br/>
spend more <br/>
&gt; than $10 - 18 dollars or so for a pretty good one. I use them for<br/>
orienteering <br/>
&gt; classes for scouts and school kids etc. They work well, but it's<br/>
not a great <br/>
&gt; hardship if you lose or break it (though I've never had one break<br/>
yet).<br/>
