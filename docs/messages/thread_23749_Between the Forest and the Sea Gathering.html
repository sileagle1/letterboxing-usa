It was fun. So perhaps next year if we do it again, I will know for<br/>
the water access boxes to give a real advantage to the first finder<br/>
that actually paddles there. I hear it was quite funny as to the<br/>
stalling that was done for the first finder.<br/>
what do yuo all think?<br/>
Should the first finder be permitted to travel by power boat, or<br/>
should they have to paddle?? wink!)<br/>
