<p>This is my first set of letterbox clues for posting. Later I will try to make my own homepage &amp; link as you prefer.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>KAZOO DOG'S E-Z LETTERBOXES</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Prairie View Park</strong></p>
<p align="left">Placed by Kazoo Dog with help from Joan &amp; Ellen - and six dogs</p>
<p align="left">Placed on January 1, 2003</p>
<p align="left">Nearest Town: Vicksburg or Portage, Micigan</p>
<p align="left">Kalamazoo County</p>
<p align="left">Easy Walking</p>
<p align="left">This letter, the first I've placed, may be the first one in any of Kalamazoo's five county parks. Prairie View Park, although its postal address is Vicksburg, is just as close to Portage. A 208-acre park with access to two lakes, Prairie View is a very popular park that has fishing and a boat ramp, swimming, soccer fields, picnic areas, sledding and hiking. Entry fee may be required; an annual pass that allows access to all Kalamazoo County Parks is $20.00 ($15.00 for seniors) or $5.00 per carload. For more information: <a href="http://www.kalcounty.com/parks/">http://www.kalcounty.com/parks/</a></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<p align="left">Prairie View Park can be reached from I-94 by taking the Portage Rd. exit south to East U Ave., turning right onto U Ave.; the park entrance is located on the right about 1/4 mile from Portage Rd. Once in the park, use the first parking area, which is immediately left of the entry booth and is the only accessible parking place during "off season" and, at all seasons, offers the letterbox hiker the nicest outing.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Clues</strong></p>
<p align="left">Once you've parked your car, you will see a paved road that leads east-west; go west on this road (in winter, the road is closed to traffic, but is generally cleared of snow). Continue walking west on this road, passing picnic areas and a road to a boat launch (in warm weather, if you have a water-loving dog with you, you may wish to take a side trip to the launch as dogs are allowed to swim in this area). Continuing west on the main road, you'll come to the Beach Pavilion (in some seasons, you can park in the large lot located here). Take time out at this spot to view Hogsett Lake. Exploring done, return to the road where the gate is located; there you will bear left, following the road in an easterly direction. Along the way, make sure to enjoy the sights, sounds and smells of both the forested and wetland areas you traverse. Once you've passed Area 5, you'll encounter a fork in the road; take the fork that veers right. Along this stretch you'll come to an that - on the right - is quite flat and wooded with a tree stump clearly visible about 35 paces away and - on the left - rises up as a small hill. There's a stump that resembles a chair on this side. Go the that stump chair, climbing north 21 paces past it (I'm a short-legged pacer.) to the Oak tree. At the Oak tree, turn 90 degrees due east, going another 16 paces to a pile of fallen, decaying brush and trees. Check out the east side of the  fallen trunk to find the letterbox. Since this area could be very busy at times, you may wish to return to the stump chair or even proceed up the road to the picnic/play area to do your stamping. After you've returned the letterbox to its place, you may retrace your steps -- or continue by returning to the road, going up the road past the picnic area. Beyond that, Gourdeneck Lake can be seen on your right. You will again come to a fort in the road; take the left one, walking past the soccer fields and ultimately reaching full circle to find your car where you left it, but now to your east.</p>
<p align="left">This is the end of my clues. Please let me know if I'm way off base in how I formatted this information. Thank you. <a href="mailto:kazoodog12001@yahoo.com">kazoodog12001@yahoo.com</a> or <a href="mailto:kazoodog@aol.com">kazoodog@aol.com</a>.</p>
