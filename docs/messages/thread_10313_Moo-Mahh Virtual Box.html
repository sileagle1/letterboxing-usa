<br/>
They've made some changes to one of the sites along the route, which <br/>
affects the workability of the clues.  I will make the necessary <br/>
modifications tonight or tomorrow and post when it is back in order.<br/>

were some significant changes made to one of the sites and I had to <br/>
change a few of the clues in the second leg of the virtual trip.<br/>

Just wanted to mention it in case you are working off printed clues --<br/>
 you will want to take a fresh copy.<br/>

people's web sites -- too much maintenance!)<br/>
