<br/>
After a (too-)long winter hibernation, I emerged this past Sunday for a new <br/>
season of letterboxing, starting with the Mile of Ledges in Burlington, CT. <br/>
The two-and-a-half hour hike was both invigorating and spectacular, but my <br/>
success rate at finding the Drewclan's letterboxes was a bit disappointing - <br/>
only one out of three. <br/>
<br/>
Jay, when next you're out that way, you might want to check on the status of <br/>
the "Tory's Den" letterbox; I am quite certain that I was in the right spot <br/>
but, after 15-20 minutes of searching high and low, I was unable to lay my <br/>
hands on it. As you noted in your clues, this is a much-frequented <br/>
hangout/party spot on the Tunxis Trail, so I wouldn't be at all surprised if <br/>
the box is now MIA. So it goes.<br/>
<br/>
