                    <html><body>I have been emailing with a very nice man from Delaware who stumbled on one of my letterboxes.  He is the manager of the James Farm Ecological Preserve in Bethany Beach.  I have officially converted him to letterboxing!  Hooray!  <br/>
<br/>
When he first emailed me, I thought for sure he was going to confiscate the box, but he is very interested in the hobby.  He really liked that people had written really nice things about the preserve in the log book.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways...He found the Baby Traveller Hitchhiker in my letterbox.  He asked what he should do with it and I told him he should go find another letterbox and rehide it!  So now we have a convert.<br/>
