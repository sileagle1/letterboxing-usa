<div>Hi... My husband and I are new to letterboxing and 
are very excited at the prospect of getting out in the woods and seeing all the 
great possibilities.  I eagerly carved a stamp and we set out to find one 
of the only two boxes in our area of the Northern Bay Area.  We had a great 
time searching for the Windsor, CA LB that was listed on the web site.  
Unfortunately, we were unable to find it (you can imagine our disappointment, 
this being our first box and all).  I think we were in the right place, but 
there were a lot of downed logs and didn't have any luck.  If whoever 
planted this box is lurking on this list, you might want to check on it.  
It could be that we just couldn't find it because of our own inexperience, but 
otherwise it is MIA.  I guess now we will go and attempt the Sugarloaf box 
as well as boxes south and east of us.  Be on the lookout for boxes we have 
planned for the future that will hopefully show off the beauty of wine country 
and the Northern CA coast.  Morningsong</div></body></html>

<div>Hi Sandy...We're in Santa Rosa.  You're right, 
Sugarloaf is a beautiful park.  We camped there quite a bit this past 
summer, had many sweet nights and met some very nice people.  We especially 
like it since it's only 20 minutes from our house and, for summer camping, much 
warmer than the beach, where we usually go in the winter.
