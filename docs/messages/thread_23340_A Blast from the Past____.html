news...<br/>
<br/>
After sitting all alone for nearly 4 YEARS, (the box , not me!!) I <br/>
was able to find the long lost Beaver Mountain Provincial Park LB, <br/>
near Antigonish, NS. The box was full of water, and, despite a <br/>
ziploc, the bag had moisture too, not the least of which was a very <br/>
soggy, runny, messy, yucky, large black stamp pad! Luckily, most of <br/>
the log book was still useable, so I dried it out as best I could, <br/>
cleaned everything up (took the stamp pad) and replaced it in its <br/>
resting spot.<br/>
<br/>
The box was planted in late 2000 (I believe, there's no official <br/>
date evident), with a log in of either Jun 9, 01 or Sep 06, 01 <br/>
depending how you interpret the date, then one more visitor in Aug <br/>
02, then....  I'm thinking that this is a serious contender for <br/>
earliest plant in Canada. I know of the Otterburn park box in QC, <br/>
but am not sure of the date.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sooo, I will attempt to contact the placer, and perhaps "adopt" it, <br/>
so It can be listed on the main site again.<br/>
