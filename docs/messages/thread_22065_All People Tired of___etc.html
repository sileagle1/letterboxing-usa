who are sick of this.  I have tried to drop this but if you read the <br/>
last post from these people you will be as baffled as I am.  The <br/>
insults just won't stop from them.  I am in tears and truly <br/>
disappointed in this.  I love letterboxing and it is such an awesome <br/>
hobby to do with my children.  When will this end and when will the <br/>
insults stop.  I did not crawl out from under a rock!!!!!!!!!<br/>
