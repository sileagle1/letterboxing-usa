<div>Perseus Letterbox</div>
<div>Placed by: Lottabit &amp; Lillbit</div>
<div>Date: March 13, 2003</div>
<div>Town: Oregon City, OR (Region 2)</div>
<div>County: Clackamas</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Directions: From I-205, take exit #10 (Park Place). Follow Hwy. 213 for 
about 3 miles until you see Clackamas Community College on the left. Turn left 
into the college and follow the signs to the Environmental Learning Center. Park 
on the left side, a little after the stop sign. On the right hand side of the 
road will be the entrance to the John Inskeep Environmental Learning Center. We 
are going to follow a Greek hero, Perseus, on one of his journeys. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>After going through the wooden archway, Perseus saw a green sign in the 
distance. He walked to the sign, but ignored the directions. When the path he 
was on gave him three choices, he took the one that allowed him to take his 
dog with him and didn't invite him to eat.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thirty steps down this path, Perseus encountered a rock-encrusted island. 
He decided to cross the span of water ahead and plotted his course from the west 
side of the "island". Take a reading of 69 degrees from here. You'll 
see where Perseus landed on the other side of the water. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>When he landed, he found a little bridge and crossed it, only to encounter 
one of Poseidon's twin-headed water monsters that had wandered onto dry land. 
Here, the path went left, and it went right. Not sure which way to go, 
Perseus asked the monster. The monster gave him a choice: if Perseus's father is 
gold, go left; if Perseus's father is silver, go right. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>After making the correct choice, Perseus continued on this path until he 
saw Medusa in a fork in the road. After using his magic shield he received from 
Athene and turning Medusa into an inanimate object, he followed the path at 45 
degrees. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Going a simple five steps down the path, Perseus decided to stay for awhile 
at the base of a tree arching over the path. He remains there today.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>*NOTE: After getting this letterbox, we suggest continuing on to Wild 
Woman's Box in a Box series. It's close by and the stamps/clues are 
wonderful!</div></body></html>
