go cross-eyed trying to figure out your Mystery Boxes. That intrigued <br/>
me so I went to have a look. Yikes! Those 4 stars will take someone <br/>
(not me) a very long time to solve. I'm not sure I'll live that long!<br/>
So, I figured I would start with your one star. That would be your <br/>
Traveller. That would mean I'd have to meet you at some O Race (I <br/>
wouldn't, so don't worry) or you are just going to have to come to <br/>
the East Coast Gathering in Richmond on September 28. I'm sure I'm <br/>
not the only one who would like to meet you. Please consider this an <br/>
invitation. I'll even offer you a beer! What's your favorite? Export <br/>
or Domestic.<br/>
   Back to your Mystery Boxes. You have a 2 star on the Eastern Shore <br/>
Treasure Map. It was planted Feb. 1999. Is it still available to <br/>
find, because I definetly know where it is located. I just don't want <br/>
to have to drive that far and find out it got washed away. I'm not <br/>
asking for help or a hint because I've solved it. Just a yes or no <br/>
regarding it's presence. Or, that's the chance you take when it comes <br/>
to treasure hunting! Then I'll just have to go shopping at the <br/>
outlets and buy my own treasure! The End<br/>
