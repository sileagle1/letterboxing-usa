Please make this Very minor correction to New CT<br/>
Mystery - Butterfly's Mystery Birthday Box<br/>
The Yahoo edit function decided to change my quote<br/>
marks to ? marks &amp; it's driving me crazy! So please<br/>
post this corrected version. Thanks!  Lobsta Lady<br/>

&gt; Seems there was this movie actor romeo who won an<br/>
&gt; oscar, and was named Charlie. He was a man who could<br/>
&gt; eat many kilograms of food at one sitting, and he<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; a yankee from up north. One November he took a trip<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; to visit Echo Lake. Now Charlie weighed many kilos<br/>
&gt; from eating too much food, but after every<br/>
&gt; performance<br/>
&gt; on stage, people still yelled "Bravo!".<br/>
&gt; While he was up at Echo Lake, he stayed at a hotel<br/>
&gt; run<br/>
&gt; by folks from India, (who just came to America in<br/>
&gt; November); they use to live on a river delta that<br/>
&gt; flooded too much. His papa was an alpha male named<br/>
&gt; Victor, who was an indian from Lima. He was a famous<br/>
&gt; indian actor known for winning an oscar in November<br/>
&gt; for his famous foxtrot scene in a popular movie. He<br/>
&gt; drove an alpha romero sports car, which he also<br/>
&gt; purchased that November.<br/>
&gt; Charlie, the oscar winning movie romeo, in November<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; Echo Lake, became quite the romeo off screen too,<br/>
&gt; causing some ladies to yell "bravo!" after he danced<br/>
&gt; with them. He was fond of food from India, and he<br/>
&gt; enjoyed playing golf. But he liked best to tango,<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; romeo, and echo's of that music echoed on &amp; on in<br/>
&gt; his dreams.<br/>
