had been in that store (as an college kid) and the inventory is <br/>
extensive.  Pink Stuff was just a few nickels more than Michaels 40% <br/>
coupon -- but they have it in stock.  Anyway their web is <br/>
www.pearlpaint.com for store locations (CA FL GA IL MD MA NJ NY PA <br/>
VA).  But their online catalog is skimpy.<br/>
