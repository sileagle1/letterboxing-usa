My neck of the woods in RI is glutted with letterboxes.<br/>

I'd like to plant something closer to Misquamicut, since the only <br/>
ones our there are real buggers to get to.  Burlingame is out, as is <br/>
Ninigret, and anywhere near URI.  I want to get closer to CT, but <br/>
still close to the water.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions for a park or location for this <br/>
series?  I'll ideally like to have rather easy terrain.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I will be doing my own research, but it doesn't hurt to ask ;-)<br/>

All of Washinton County, RI.  South Kingstown, North Kingstown, West <br/>
Kingston, Charlestown ..... just look on the list.  I can't walk to <br/>
the grocery store without saying "oh, such and such a letterbox is <br/>
over there".<br/>

Parting is such sweet sorrow, but (IMHO) I think this series is cool.<br/>
