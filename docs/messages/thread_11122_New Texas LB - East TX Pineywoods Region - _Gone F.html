Lake Livingston State Park contains 635 acres along near the old <br/>
ghost town of Swartwout, which was a steamboat landing site from <br/>
1830s to the 1850s on the Trinity River.  The park offers camping, <br/>
picnicking, swimming, mountain biking, nature study, fishing, and <br/>
horse riding.  The park has showers, a boat ramp, and a swimming <br/>
pool.  There are also 4.4 miles of trails for hiking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
The "Gone Fishin" letterbox is located in Lake Livingston State Park, <br/>
near Livingston, Texas.  From Livingston, go south on Hwy 59, then 4 <br/>
miles west on FM1988,  mile north on FM 3126 to Park Road 65.  This <br/>
is 75 miles north of Houston, Texas.  Obtain a park map from the <br/>
entry station, and drive to the Pineywoods Nature Trail (to your <br/>
right). Park near the interpretive sign.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Start your hike on the trail marked "One Mile Loop Trail".  Stay <br/>
straight on the boardwalk until the Duck Pond is in site.  Just <br/>
before the Pond, the boardwalk splits, with an interpretive sign <br/>
("Gossamer Wings" at the junction.  Go right, heading South, for 4 <br/>
paces.  You should have a stair step on each side of you.  The box is <br/>
under the bottom step of the right side stair steps, on top of a <br/>
board to keep it dry.  If you are on the grass facing the stairs, it <br/>
will be on the right side.  Reach over the top of this step and back <br/>
under.   Be sure to put back on top of the wood piece!!!<br/>
