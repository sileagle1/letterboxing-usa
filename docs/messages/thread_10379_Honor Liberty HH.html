The Honor Liberty HH has been returned to the wild, after a very <br/>
brief stay over in our letterboxing bag.  The Honor Liberty HH is at <br/>
the "EMS Stands For: Emergency Medical Services" Box #2.  The owner <br/>
of the box wished it's where abouts listed, there for it is.  And may <br/>
I say that the stamp is just great, Amy and I just loved it.  Also <br/>
the hike for EMS 1 and 2 is just perfict this time of year no bugs, <br/>
most of the water is dried up and the landscapes are just great.  I <br/>
had forgotten just how much I enjoyed that hike.  Thanks to all<br/>
