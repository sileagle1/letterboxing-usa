I found both Cedar Hills Twins, plus the Fanno Creek Letterboxes <br/>
belonging to Der Mad Stamper.<br/>
<br/>
However, were unable to locate the Greenway Park Letterbox.  By the <br/>
clues we were pretty sure we were at the right site, across the creek <br/>
and all, but nothing was to be found.  Does anybody know if this box <br/>
is missing???<br/>
