Environmental Classroom Letterbox<br/>
<br/>

Kettle Moraine Lutheran High School is located just to the east of Jackson,<br/>
WI.  The school has been blessed with a large campus nestled next to farms<br/>
and DNR land.  During construction of the last two building additions the<br/>
school had the unique opportunity to turn part of its campus into an outdoor<br/>
environmental classroom and build a wetland wastewater treatment facility<br/>
(the first of its kind in the northern US) due in large part to the efforts<br/>
of their biology instructor.  The area public is<br/>
welcome to hike on the environmental trails for leisure and exercise.<br/>
Permission from the school is granted for letterboxers to visit the school<br/>
grounds for the purpose of seeking the Environmental Classroom Letterbox<br/>
provided the letterboxers follow the standard letterboxing code of conduct<br/>
and letterboxing wavier, keep contact with the student body to a minimum,<br/>
and respect the Christian environment of the campus.  The clues do pass<br/>
letterboxers around some athletic fields and along the cross country course<br/>
(partly located in the environmental classroom).  Letterboxers can search<br/>
for the letterbox without interfering with any athletic events except for<br/>
the home cross country meet always held on the last Thursday of August. (As<br/>
I am the cross country coach, I would strongly recommend you avoid that date<br/>
unless you want to get trampled!)  Also, the wetlands can be very wet if<br/>
there has been a lot of rain.  There could be flooded or muddy trails.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Jackson is located at the intersection of Hwy. 45 and Hwy. 60 in Washington<br/>
County, WI, twenty minutes north of Milwaukee.  Just east of Hwy. 45 on Hwy.<br/>
60 is a stop light where Hwy. 60 intersects County P.  Take County P south<br/>
about a mile to the first crossroad (Sherman Road).  Head east on Sherman<br/>
Road 2.6 miles (over railroad tracks, past Maple Road) to where there is a<br/>
gravel road on the north side of Sherman Road between a farmhouse and<br/>
another house (it is 1/4 mile west of Division Rd (Hwy. G) which is the<br/>
first stop you come to after the railroad tracks).  The gravel road is<br/>
blocked by a metal gate after a few yards.  Enter on the gravel road and<br/>
park off to the side near the gate. (If the gate is open there is a sporting<br/>
event going on and you may drive to the end of the gravel road and park in<br/>
the parking lot with the other spectators.)<br/>
<br/>
Walk north along the gravel road to the end of the tree line on your right.<br/>
As soon as the tree line ends, take a right turn up the embankment to the<br/>
mound located in front of a small wetland.  Locate the large sign there<br/>
explaining what this area is about and decipher the first three cryptogram<br/>
clues (see the end of these clues).<br/>
<br/>
Standing before the mound, turn to the northwest and spot the baseball<br/>
backstop in the distance.  Walk to the backstop and as you walk along the<br/>
fence from its start along the first base side to its end along the third<br/>
base side, count the number of vertical poles in the ground that make-up the<br/>
fence.  Keep this number for later.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the baseball fence, turn left so your back is towards the last<br/>
pole you counted and walk 12 paces to the gully.  Turn right and walk 80<br/>
paces parallel to the gully.  You will now be at the end of the snowmobile<br/>
trail located down the embankment from leftfield.  Turn right and go down<br/>
the trail 64 paces to where the trail splits.<br/>
<br/>
Head on the NW trail to its end at the fishing pond (some students may be<br/>
fishing here).  Answer cryptogram clue #4.  Count how many birdhouses there<br/>
are in the pond.  Keep this number for later.<br/>
<br/>
Go back to where the trail had split and take the NE trail this time.  Stay<br/>
to the left on that trail as it follows along the fishing pond.  Soon you<br/>
will come upon a large rowboat (unless its being used in the pond).  What<br/>
4-digit number is part of the boats registration code?  Keep this number<br/>
for later.<br/>
<br/>
Turn around and face south and take the trail on the left until it meets up<br/>
with the snowmobile trail again.  Turn left and head straight down the<br/>
snowmobile trail until you are forced to turn right where the trail meets<br/>
the island pond.  Follow the path as it goes around the island pond.  On<br/>
your way around, you might check for any snakes under the snake board on<br/>
your right at the first trail intersection you come to.  (Here students<br/>
study the variety of WI snakes local to our area - if they arent too<br/>
afraid.)  Continue around the front of the island pond.  At the picnic<br/>
table, take the right trail and stay right until you come out of the<br/>
wetlands.  Turn left and walk along the rim of the wetlands until you find a<br/>
large engraved rock standing up in a landscaped area.  Answer cryptogram<br/>
clues 5-7.  What Psalm is quoted?  Keep this number for later.<br/>
<br/>
Take the trail that enters the wetlands to the left (north) of the engraved<br/>
rock.  You will soon reach the outdoor classroom located on a small<br/>
peninsula.  How many benches are there (dont include picnic tables)?  Use<br/>
this number and the other numbers you collected to calculate the compass<br/>
heading you need:<br/>
<br/>
First divide the boat reg. # by the # of benches and subtract the number of<br/>
baseball poles times the number of the Psalm<br/>
(in other words: (Boat Reg. # / # of benches) - (# of baseball poles x Psalm<br/>
#))<br/>
then divide this number by twice the number of bird houses in the fishing<br/>
pond,<br/>
then subtract the number of baseball posts,<br/>
and lastly, subtract the number of birdhouses times the number of benches.<br/>
The resulting number is the compass heading you need.<br/>
<br/>
Stand in the middle of the classroom benches and spy the brown and green<br/>
man-made object at the heading you calculated.  You need to get to that<br/>
object (hint: use the path around the pond).<br/>
<br/>
Once at the object, answer cryptogram clue #8.  Face west and take the trail<br/>
to the right to the picnic table that you can see.  Sit down at the picnic<br/>
table and decipher the final clues using the code from the cryptogram clues.<br/>
<br/>
Cryptogram Clues:<br/>
<br/>
1) Name of this project:                      TH QPGH<br/>
<br/>
2) What the last E stands for:                HAXEGFAWHAN<br/>
<br/>
3) The schools initials:                    UWZMV<br/>
<br/>
4) What man-made object is at the end of the trail?        LEQAEQ NPDZH<br/>
<br/>
5) What is the 4th engraved word?                WK<br/>
<br/>
6) What type of waters?                    SCEHN<br/>
<br/>
7) What is the 8th last engraved word?            JFCARHR<br/>
<br/>
8) What is the 4th word on the object?            MEBM<br/>
