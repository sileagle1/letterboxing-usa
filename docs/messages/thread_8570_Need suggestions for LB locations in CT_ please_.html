                    <html><body><p>Donna, Sleeping Giant State Park in Hamden, CT, has many letterboxes. Some are easy finds while others require tougher hikes. About 25 minutes south in Woodbridge at Alice Newton Park you and your kids might enjoy the Lewis &amp; Clark series. The park is really beautiful and the three boxes there take about an hour and a half to two hours of leisurely strolling.  There are three boxes at Gillette Castle as well as the castle itself. That is about a 50 minute drive from Wallingford. There are others as well and I am sure you will get many responses.
