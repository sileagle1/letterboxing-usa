I just came across your website and the entire concept of <br/>
Letterboxing.   I have to say I am very intrigued.  I am <br/>
working on a book and a road trip that I think will tie in <br/>
beautifully with letterboxing.  Let me explain the project <br/>
and hopefully you can offer comments or suggestions!<br/>
<br/>
I am in the process of writing a book proposal for a book <br/>
called Dinotour.  The book will be a travel related book <br/>
showcasing art, attractions, and monuments inspired by or <br/>
dedicated to dinosaurs.  The working subtitle is “A Roadside <br/>
Guide to Prehistoric Parks and Dinosaur Art of North <br/>
America.”<br/>
<br/>
Dinotour will examine humanity’s long fascination with <br/>
prehistoric creatures and the resulting representations of <br/>
dinosaur in the form of roadside art.  Sometimes this has <br/>
taken the form of commercial architecture or homespun theme <br/>
parks.  At other times it has taken the form of untrained <br/>
artists tinkering with cement, found objects, and recyclable <br/>
material.  The photograph-laden book will appeal to fans of <br/>
roadside monuments and unusual attractions, fans of folk art <br/>
and commercial architecture, and, need I mention, fans of <br/>
dinosaurs.  Now I am thinking there may be room for a very <br/>
unusual letterboxing event.   <br/>
<br/>
To write this book I will be conducting a road trip across <br/>
the North American continent to photograph dinosaurs and <br/>
interview artists, creators, and attraction owners. This <br/>
will be my real-life “Dinotour.”  I already know of several <br/>
dozen dinosaur locations in The US and Canada including <br/>
fiberglass or cement attractions, sculpture parks, folk art <br/>
dinosaurs, and dinosaur monuments in front of museums.  <br/>
Nearly every dinosaur the book will showcase will be <br/>
outside, usually in an open setting.  <br/>
<br/>
What I would like to do, with your help, is let people know <br/>
about this project and give them a chance to initiate.  I <br/>
would love for people to design special dinosaur stamps and <br/>
place with their logbooks at these dinosaur attractions, <br/>
sculpture parks, and museums.  If we could get a person <br/>
nearest to each of the major attractions to design and place <br/>
the <br/>
stamp that would be perfect.  <br/>
<br/>
When I conduct my tour this fall, I will collect the stamps <br/>
and showcase them in the book if the letterboxers wish.  <br/>
After all, the book is about the intersection of travel, <br/>
dinosaurs, and art and I think that the letterboxing stamps <br/>
are the perfect example of that junction.  I can include a <br/>
full chapter on the letterboxing aspect of the book/tour and <br/>
how your site was the inspiration.  The book will give full <br/>
credit to the stamp designers and I will likely interview <br/>
some of the planters to get their tales of letterboxing or <br/>
dinosaurs.  <br/>
<br/>
In return I will of course design a special Dinotour stamp <br/>
to leave at other dinosaur attractions and also use it to <br/>
stamp the books that I found.  If the original planters <br/>
wish, I can leave my Dinotour stamp with theirs for future <br/>
visitors.  More visitors will come once they pick up my book <br/>
and do their own Dinotour.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you agree with me that this will be a fun idea?  Let me <br/>
know if you think there is an aspect that I have not thought <br/>
about or if you would like more details on the book.  Even <br/>
though, I would not be doing the tour until August, I still <br/>
would like to get your advice and potentially start <br/>
promoting the idea now so that letterboxers across the US <br/>
and Canada can start designing their stamps!  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">thanks for forwarding the post Drew Clan.  This is an intriguing <br/>
idea.  I wouldn't mind writing him about the tour, there are a lot of <br/>
dinosaur skeletons and such in UT and depending on the <br/>
timing, I could probably plant some boxes for it.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't write him back as the link wasn't turned on to his <br/>
personal address and Yahoo cuts it off.  Could you let us know <br/>
how to make contact (if the writer doesn't  read the list himself).  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, as always,<br/>
