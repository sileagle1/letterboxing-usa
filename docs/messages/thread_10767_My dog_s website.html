Enjoy! As soon as I figure out how to add a link to my new site, I'll add a<br/>
link to my dog's site (and others)<br/>

&gt; Very nice website.  I like your carvings and think you did a good job at<br/>
&gt; them. You do need to get a better picture of yourself so we can see you<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; you are not in the shadows. I was also hoping to see more of your dogs.<br/>
You<br/>
&gt; made some very nice dog stamps and I was glad you did post them so I could<br/>
&gt; see some stamps from other parts of the country. I also looked at your<br/>
clues<br/>
&gt; to see how you did them. Very good. You seemed to have some good ideas<br/>
&gt; there. Thanks for giving us a look at your website. I enjoyed looking.<br/>
Wish<br/>
&gt; we could meet you and your dogs.....Chuck and Molly in CT<br/>
