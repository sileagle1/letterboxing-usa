                    <div class="plaintext-content">  This one just happened to me about two weeks ago.  My fiencee and I were on our way from Rockford, IL area to Las Vegas, NV (not to get married though).  I had selected boxes along the way.  My goal was to get at least one box for every state we traveled through.<br/>
<br/>
  We stopped in Boulder City, NV to get the "Big Horn Sheep" box.  I has to ask about the park (since we were from out of town and didn't know the area) and the employees said big horn sheep come down from the mountain in the morning and early afternoon.  So if we were lucky we could possibly see one or two.<br/>
<br/>
  When we arrived at the park there was about 40-50 big horn sheep.  WOW!  I got to see some new wildlife, and not in a zoo!  So about after 10 minutes of photographing the sheep, it's time to get the box.  And the sheep are standing right in front of the landmark in the clue!  I drove 2000 miles for this box!!!<br/>
<br/>
  So we waited for 30 miuntes, and they wouldn't leave.  In fact, 4 more came down from the mountain!  And it was the begining to mating season, so the sheep were feeling a bit, um...frisky...yikes!<br/>
<br/>
  So we had to abandon the box since neither of us wanted to get rammed.  We didn't have a chance to go back for it.  However, we did snag the "Neon Boneyard" box later, so I got my Nevada box.  But that box has a whole other Murphy's Law story to go with it....  Perhaps I will share some other time.<br/>

<br/>
  Ok, we set off to find the Neon Boneyard.   My boyfriend asked a waitress at Circus Circus if she knew where the neon sign graveyard was.  "Oh, graveyard specials don't start until 11 pm," she replied.  Ok, not the answer were were looking for.  So I consulted my area map I picked up at the Vegas Welcome Center and we headed off.<br/>
<br/>
  At one point the street V'ed off, and we took the left lane, since the map showed that street would connect to the street we were looking for anyway.  Soon we came to the freeway (15, I believe) and the street forced us to get on.  And then we were stuck in bumper to bumper traffic.  The exit ramp 1/4 a mile away was backed up, and just not well planned out.  There was 2 stop lights on the exit ramp, which snarled traffic more.  So after about 45 minutes we were free of the traffic and on our way.<br/>
<br/>
  The maps I had of the area were very misleading.  Streets would stop abruptly, only to pick up a block later.  Finally we found the street we were looking for.  But since we didn't find the Boneyard itself, we didn't know how far to travel down this road.  So we drove.  We passed by a park and I couldn't see the sign for the street it was on (part of the clue) and we drove past.  My little navagator 6th sence went off in my head saying, that was the park, I know it!  But we opted to keep driving.  <br/>
<br/>
  Finally we stopped at a gas station because we were driving on Empty.  (Gas was $2.35 a gal, yikes!!!)  I went inside to look at a more detailed area map.  Some locals who were playing slots (yes, slots are everywhere) asked what I was looking for.  I told them the Neon Boneyard, and they laughed.  "Why do you want to see that?"  Because I'm a goofy tourist who's looking for a letterbox, I thought to myself.  Of course, they wouldn't tell me where it was.<br/>
<br/>
  I found a park on the map, and the cross street mentioned in the clue.  Guess what, it was the park we passed up about 3 miles back!  We were still in Las Vegas, but wound up in an area called Sumerlin. So we back tracked and found the park.  We couldn't find one of the landmarks in the clue, but we continued forth, matched up some other landmarks and found the box.  I was so happy to find the box, since it was my first Nevada box, and we went through all heck trying to get to the park.  There was some homeless people sleeping in the park, and they kept giving us funny looks, though.  <br/>
<br/>
  We took a different route back to the hotel.  And what did we find along the way?  The NEON BONEYARD!  Oh, there it is!  So we viewed the old neon signs and fought traffic back to the motel where we took a well deserved nap.  At least I found the box!<br/>
