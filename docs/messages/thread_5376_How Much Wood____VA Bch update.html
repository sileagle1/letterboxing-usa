&gt; ROLF - thanks for the morning laugh, Jay!  I knew I<br/>

<br/>
Well, yeah, Tig, you carry your camera but how many times did ya get <br/>
it out of the backpack?  LOL (I'm guilty, too, btw). I think the only <br/>
ones we got of our latest escapades were of us both covered in mud <br/>
after biking in after a torential rain storm to pick up the Gore <br/>
family's "Hot Spot" (which ya gotta get that little guy- he's had no <br/>
other visitors!). <br/>
<br/>
 We are certainly not as cute in mud as a wayward woodchuck, though <br/>
pictures could have been useful in identifying the many snakes we <br/>
came upon in the middle of the trail... (reminder--always look on the <br/>
other side of the log before putting your foot down!)  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested I would be willing to teach you the "Away <br/>
Snake" dance that seems to work well in clearing the path of most <br/>
snakes except for the lazy cottonmouth.  It does involve a little <br/>
dance and song (which could be mistaken for a scream but it is, <br/>
indeed, a song)- it's easy to learn. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
PUPA and CARDINALS RULE in York River State park are in good <br/>
condition (although the two log books in Pupa were a bit confusing at <br/>
first). Very cool park to explore!!<br/>
<br/>
In First Landing State Park we found OVALS OF CASSINI and WITCHES OF <br/>
AGNESI to be in good but slightly damp condition.  They sorely need <br/>
visitors! (beware of copperheads on this trail- I've come into <br/>
contact with them on two separate occassions...there is a resident <br/>
fox you may see, as well).<br/>
<br/>
We found CASTAWAY(cool stamp) in good condition and found out there <br/>
is a new hitch hiker in the area--now who has him and where will he <br/>
land?   Were the first to stamp into HOT SPOT- he's definitely worth <br/>
the trip.  We hiked to Castaway and biked to Hot Spot- but both could <br/>
be either biked or hiked, your choice.<br/>
<br/>
Found a great box in AMERICAN PRIDE in Suffolk as well as picked up a <br/>
nice surprise there (thanks again Gore family).  <br/>
<br/>
SeaDog's POW box is also in great condition and awaiting visitors.  <br/>
Ladybug's FORT STORY LIGHTHOUSE is also in good condition.<br/>
<br/>
My GARDEN GNOME is again MIA and probably won't be replaced.  REDWING <br/>
is still there and waiting for visitors.<br/>
<br/>
There also is another new hitchhiker out and about called "Golden <br/>
Dragon's Destiny" planted by new boxers in the area.  Be on the <br/>
lookout for it.<br/>

&gt; Wow!  Thanks for the update on our boxes, you've been busy!  We<br/>
&gt; haven't had a chance to get out there as we have actually been<br/>
&gt; scoping out some other parks to place boxes.  It's amazing how many<br/>
&gt; wonderful parks there are and we never would have discovered them if<br/>
&gt; it hadn't been for this awesome hobby!  Sorry to hear about Garden<br/>
&gt; Gnome, becoming quite the problem child isn't he?  I'm glad we got a<br/>
&gt; chance to find him before he slipped away for good, that was the<br/>
&gt; first box we ever found.<br/>
