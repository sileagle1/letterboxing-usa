                    <div class="plaintext-content">Deepest NJ 1 has been found for the second time yesterday.  Sorry if I'm<br/>
gloating too much.:-)  Since Todd and Pam are on the left coast, I've<br/>
volunteered to adopt it.  It's in good condition, but some of the local<br/>
clues may have to be updated in the future as nature takes its course.<br/>
However, the clues that get you to the general area will remain the same.<br/>
In an off-list e-mail I discussed some of the clues and thanked them for not<br/>
making it any easier.  That's what made the find all the more sweet.<br/>
Although I've adopted it, I still feel that they should have the last word<br/>
in any changes to the clues since they placed it.<br/>
<br/>
I picked up four all together yesterday.  The first one, Ken Lockwood Gorge<br/>
(nowhere near DNJ1) was an excellent find; not just in letterboxing, but in<br/>
regards to a great place to visit.   I also stamped into one of the<br/>
"Somewhere in NJ" letterboxes, but didn't have time to look for the other<br/>
since I had a long trip to DNJ1.<br/>
<br/>
I can't say what the last one was since it's too close to DNJ1 and that<br/>
would spoil all the fun.  The only advice I'll give is the same that Todd<br/>
gave to me when I met him and Pam on the trail last year.  When you find the<br/>
pieces, it will make sense.<br/>
<br/>
Use your imagination and "remember Margaret!"<br/>
