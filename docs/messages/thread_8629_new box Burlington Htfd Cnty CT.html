                    <html><body> Trees of the Forest Box, Burlington Ct<br/>
&gt; Nassehegon St Forest on Punchbrook Rd<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is another of the boxes I planted for my son's soccer season.<br/>
&gt; But I missed this game and had no idea what I'd find when I got<br/>
&gt; there.  What I found was closed gates to the fields and lots of NO<br/>
&gt; DOGS signs so we, the dog and I, went into the forest instead.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Directions: From the junction of Rt 179 and Rt 4 go west on Rt 4 to the first<br/>
&gt; left (Punchbrook).  There is a blinking light there.  Go 1.5 miles to<br/>
&gt; a 3 way intersection and continue on straight till you reach 2 miles.<br/>
&gt; There are soccer fields on your left and the State Forest sign (those<br/>
&gt; ugly brown and gold ones) on your right.  Pull in to the right.<br/>
&gt; (there's not much room there-maybe 3 cars if you're careful)<br/>
&gt; Head down the dirt road to the "Forest Thinning" sign<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Aside:  If you want a nice hike before you box read on.  If not, go<br/>
&gt; directly to Clues.  Go right at the sign and head down the path till<br/>
&gt; you come to a junction with the blue trail.  You want to go right, to<br/>
&gt; the south on the narrow path.  There is a blue blaze on a thin tree<br/>
&gt; ahead of you to the right and the junction is just before that.  There<br/>
&gt; are trees down across the path.  Climb them and head down blue till<br/>
&gt; you come to a junction.  Go right, uphill, onto an unmarked trail.<br/>
&gt; This brings you back to the main trail where you go left and back to<br/>
&gt; the Thinning sign.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Clues:  At the Forest Thinning sign there are 3 paths to choose from.<br/>
&gt; Take the left one (if you took the hike first, it's the one ahead of<br/>
&gt; you when you come back).  Head thru the white pines to where the<br/>
&gt; birches point south.  This is about 60 paces in from the dbl trunked<br/>
&gt; birch on the left beyond the open space at the start of the trail.<br/>
&gt; From the pointing birches there is a multi trunked tree at 340<br/>
&gt; degrees.  Beyone this at 335 degrees is a hollow stump with your<br/>
&gt; treasure.<br/>
&gt; Because on the forest thinning I felt limited in hiding places and had<br/>
&gt; to find one away from that area.<br/>
