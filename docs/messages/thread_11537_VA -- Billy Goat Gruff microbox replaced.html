Go past the entrance to the Visitors Center and follow the signs to the Nature <br/>
Center. Park in the lot. Take the footpath just past mailbox #8314 to the Paw <br/>
Paw Trail and turn left. When you come to the footbridge, look under the NW <br/>
corner for Billy Goat Gruff, who is keeping an eye peeled for trolls.<br/>
Note: It is tucked WAY up and behind leaves.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Call off the search party!  We are really happy to hear that you've replaced <br/>
your box!  We'll make sure we hide it very, very well when we go to look for <br/>
it (which we will do ASAP before it goes AWOL again) A.O.K!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of search parties -- we will have to go look for your other boxes <br/>
in the "unknown" land by Riverbend.  After getting lost last fall at Claude <br/>
Moore, team BeMa was very wary of going after any boxes in areas without <br/>
park rangers to rescue us (should the need have arisen)  (of course, we know <br/>
from Psychomommy that firemen will come to you no matter where you are -- <br/>
and in great numbers!...)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for planting so many near or in Riverbend!  I think there are eight <br/>
total in the park or a stone's throw from it.  It's as close to a CT like <br/>
density that you can find around here! :)  BeMa<br/>
