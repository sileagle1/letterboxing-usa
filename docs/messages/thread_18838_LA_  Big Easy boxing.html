I've got no idea if a regional talklist exists for LA--here's an <br/>
update on boxes we found or didn't find on our recent excursion into <br/>
the Big Easy and around its environs...<br/>
<br/>
Cancer Corner:  alive &amp; well on 12 May 04 and again on 16 May 04 <br/>
(despite multiple missing reports over the years)<br/>
<br/>
#23 in K*enne*r: alive &amp; well on 13 May 04, awesome stamp<br/>
<br/>
Dixie Beer:  alive &amp; well on 16 May 04--it happens to be on THE <br/>
biggest ant hill I've ever seen in my life--the entire hill was <br/>
covered in millions upon millions of biting ants, recent deluges <br/>
have made this region the muddiest spot in the world, perhaps.  The <br/>
box, however, is still alive &amp; well, great stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Mardi Gras:  alive &amp; well on 16 May 04 (it's funny--our hotel was a <br/>
block from this box--we passed it at least 12 times before realizing <br/>
the box was actually hidden in this part of town!)<br/>
<br/>
For*tress P*ike:  alive &amp; well on 17 May 04 (awesome stamp, awesome <br/>
letterbox--absolutely loved this one--lots &amp; lots of visitors to the <br/>
box, too)<br/>
<br/>
Lock 1:  alive &amp; well on 17 May 04 (this region is THE mosquito <br/>
procreation site in the US--I recommend future visitors douse <br/>
themselves in repellant before they venture out on this one)  found <br/>
a snake skin near the box which hastened my steps a bit, loved the <br/>
opportunity to walk across the lock, reminded me a bit of home  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Attempted but no luck with:<br/>
<br/>
Lock 2:  lots of dead turtle remnants in the region &amp; what appears <br/>
to be a popular drinking hangout for the area youth--have no clue if <br/>
we were near the spot--found the cypress enshrined in a tree but <br/>
couldn't find the 'pine'--the clues said digging wasn't necessary--<br/>
did find a 'hole' near a pine but no box--poked a little bit but <br/>
didn't dig anywhere around adjacent trees, if recent rains have <br/>
anything to do with this box being difficult to find it's probably <br/>
because digging is now required or a turtle took off with the box<br/>
<br/>
Slidell #18?:  tried this box but no luck finding it--lots of <br/>
flooded trails and washouts in the area, gave up looking for it, <br/>
it's probably still there, we just didn't want to dig for it and <br/>
walking around swampy trails/washouts wasn't very appealing at the <br/>
time<br/>
<br/>
Taleesheek:  attempted this box in a deluge, think we found the <br/>
right trail at the azimuth from the 'sign' but never found a trail <br/>
with a fallen log on it, this looked like a popular place for the <br/>
folks to dump their 'not so gently used' items, gave up looking for <br/>
the box when the deluge hit<br/>
<br/>
Left three souvenirs for future finders--clues are a bit more <br/>
difficult on purpose, hope future visitors will bring freezer <br/>
ziplocs with them to swap out our bags since I'm not sure how long <br/>
the letterboxes in their current configuration will survive.  Just a <br/>
few more days of 'deluges' in the region will probably kill these <br/>
boxes quickly because I forgot to provide them with individual SCUBA <br/>
gear!  "and folks say it rains in Seattle all of the time???"  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for an interesting and storied tour around the Big Easy this <br/>
past week.  Unfortunately, we were short on time and long on tornado <br/>
warnings and mega-downpours during our trip, which put a damper on <br/>
some of our boxing exploits. We attempted a couple other boxes in <br/>
the area but I can't remember their names at the moment.  The link <br/>
to the Natl Mystery LB Project box is no longer active--not sure if <br/>
the box was pulled, too.  Sorry we were unable to link up with any <br/>
area letterboxers.  We were extrememly limited in our internet <br/>
access and cell phone attempts to link up with folks failed.  <br/>
Perhaps on another trek to the region?<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails,<br/>
