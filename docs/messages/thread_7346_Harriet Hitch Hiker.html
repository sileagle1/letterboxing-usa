                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  We got a HH today!  Harriet Hitch Hiker was found today at Rockwood<br/>
Park in Chesterfield Va. We shall carry her onward!<br/>
    I have never posted to a talk list before.... hope this works.<br/>
    My two cents.  If the Mid atlantic get together is held in Richmond,<br/>
Biki and I would surely attend.  Letterboxing has become a wonderful hobby<br/>
for us, and we would like to meet the folks that we see the stamps of in the<br/>
boxes we visit.  <br/>
<br/>
    Healwar and Biki<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Look for a new box at the Carillon in Richmond! coming soon!(box and<br/>
stamp are made and planted, just need to finish clues)<br/>
