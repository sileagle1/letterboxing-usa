                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings to Bonnie, Rae, et al,<br/>
<br/>
My children and I had a very nice mini-vacation on Cape Cod, and I <br/>
was able to make contact with all three of the Massachusetts <br/>
letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
On Thursday we arrived (from a day in Plymouth) at Woods Hole. We <br/>
spent the morning at the aquarium and the Exhibit Center, but after <br/>
lunch we headed down to Quisset Harbor and discovered the charm of <br/>
the Knob. We traced the route of the two young lovers, swang on the <br/>
swing, found the secret hiding place, and saw two beautiful Orcas. <br/>
Thank you, Rae! The box is in fine shape.<br/>
<br/>
We rendez-voused with my wife on Friday at the Museum of Fine <br/>
Arts in Boston. Today my youngest son David and I headed home a <br/>
longer way, via Route 2 to Greenfield, MA. David found Bonnie's El <br/>
Corazon box fairly quickly - it has wintered just fine, Bonnie. Then <br/>
we headed on after the Vincent box. Your new clues were very <br/>
helpful, in giving us a better idea of the distance in the final <br/>
stretch. We found the box in the clearing without any problems. The <br/>
top of the plastic container was cracked and there was some water in <br/>
the box. The stamp and journal were fine, however, being well <br/>
protected by the ziplock bag.<br/>
<br/>
I was interested to see, Bonnie, that you are using the same journals <br/>
as I have been using: 3" x 4" double spiral books from the Michael <br/>
Rogers Press (Middlesex, NJ), made for and obtainable from Barnes &amp; <br/>
Noble. I recommend these to all, though they are somewhat pricey<br/>
<br/>
There is still some snow on the highest hills her in Vermont, but <br/>
spring has definitely arrived. Good hunting (and salting) to all.<br/>

about the cracked lid and soon as I have time I'll replace that <br/>
particular box.  I'm glad to know the revised clue made it easier to <br/>
find it.<br/>
<br/>
I chose the notebooks based on their size.  They were not pricey where <br/>
I purchased them, which was at Pearl Art Supply in Boston.  <br/>
Actually, they were on sale.  However, I'm sure they cost more at <br/>
Barnes &amp; Noble.  Discount art supply stores like Pearl and Utrecht <br/>
offer the best deals, in my experience.<br/>
<br/>
I'm feeling a little guilty about not getting that cracked box <br/>
replaced yet!  But being a painter who also works a full time job I <br/>
have very little free time on the weekends, so I envy those of you who <br/>
can give a whole weekend to letterboxing!  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there are definitely more Mass. boxes to come....<br/>

Erik used to play there as a kid and he really enjoys knowing that other<br/>
people have experienced the living history of the place.  Can't you just<br/>

<div>Went out this Saturday to find the new boxes at 
Wendell State Forest. Joyce (You Inspire My Spirit) and I (lonemasswolf) were 
the first to find the Spring Peepers and Oft She Visits boxes. Joyce then found 
Corazon, and Vincent. And almost two years to the day since I found the same 
two, we found Saint Exupery. The only strange item was that on such a glorious 
Saturday there was no one in the park.</div>
<div>Now it was off to North Amherst, where The Little 
Pig awaited us. Having stamped in and taken one of the little pink souvenirs, it 
was on to North Sugarloaf.</div>
<div>In all honesty, I do have to say that the climb to 
the summit was one of the more difficult "gentle" climbs, that I have 
experienced.</div>

That's one reason I love Wendell.  It's never overrun!  <br/>

&gt; In all honesty, I do have to say that the climb to the summit was <br/>
one of the more difficult "gentle" climbs, that I have experienced.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to climbs to other summits in the area, North Mount Sugarloaf <br/>
was not too hard for me. But based on your experience, I've deleted <br/>
the word "gentle" and changed the terrain description to <br/>
"easy/moderate." Thanks!  I'm so happy you had a successful day of <br/>
letterboxing out here.<br/>

That would be me, I'm afraid.  I've since worked myself into much <br/>

I've also gotten better at deciphering clues and directions.<br/>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the past few weeks, I've found Rock Meadows 
(Belmont, MA) and I hear that the Beaver Brook one is definitely there, 
too.  Happy Birthday was at Stow, MA on 27 Apr.  Angel's Lookout was 
at Peppercorn Point/Upton, MA on that same day.  Tangled Woods is an easy 
one in Milford, MA... don't make it more complex than it needs to be; it took me 
two tries to find it, talking to myself and saying, Duuuuhhhhh! 
*grin*</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm going back to Lincoln, MA to re-check Two 
Hearts at the DeCordova.  The trail in the clues has been covered over with 
compost from landscaping, but I'm not ready to give up on the letterbox 
yet.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I hope this helps!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cheerfully,</div>
<div>Aisling</div>

I routinely perform "care and feeding" on my boxes, and they are <br/>
definitely in place:<br/>
<br/>
Tangled Woods (Milford)<br/>
Hunters Falls (Upton)<br/>
Marathon (Hopkinton)<br/>
Angel's Lookout (Upton)<br/>
Peace on Earth (Westborough)<br/>
<br/>
As an added bonus, they are all within approximately five miles of <br/>
each other, so you can snag them in one fell swoop.<br/>
<br/>
Also nearby is Piece of Cake (Hopkinton)(although I've never found <br/>
it) and the Friends Forever Series (Upton)(I have found 1 of 4 so <br/>
far).  A bit farther out is Bonsai (Uxbridge).<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is helpful.<br/>

<br/>
If a box is reported to be missing, it is noted on the clue page.  At <br/>
the moment, we know that Praying Woman of the Charles and Hancock Hill <br/>
are missing.  The others, so far as I know, are still there.<br/>
<br/>
Keep trying!  Perhaps you simply didn't find some of the boxes you have <br/>
hunted.  Some clues are trickier than others.  I found a box recently <br/>
that a friend of mine thought must be missing--but, even though she <br/>
could not find it, the box was indeed there.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
