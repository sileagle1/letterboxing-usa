So far, it's worked. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With our annual Bed &amp; Boxing events, I do let the manager/coordinator know exactly what we do just in case the staff runs across one of our boxes hidden in the hotel or on the grounds. I've yet to have resistance to that as they are making enough money on the number of rooms that are generally used. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With our letterboxing cruises, again, we let the group coordinator know of our activities and obtain permission. Since 9/11, there are hidden cameras all over a ship and I'd rather be truthful than have to bail someone out of jail! <br/>

Not sure if anyone even looks at this List anymore but thought I would ask a question anyway. Every year when I host our LB Event I get asked by Park people and other curious onlookers what our group represents. In the beginning I told the truth and tried to explain letterboxing, but I quickly realized this caused more questions than I was prepared to answer and besides, I value the secrecy of letterboxing too much to expose it that way. For several years after that I would say we were a reunion of friends, and this worked ok but still did not explain why we were busily stamping into logbooks. Next I tried saying we were a craft club. This explained our activities in the building but not on the trails. Also, I got some strange looks from guy rangers obviously questioning my manhood. This is Texas after all. This year I was thinking of saying we are a Nature club. It would explain being on the trails and the logbooks could be notes on our nature finds. Of course this could backfire like it did for me one time when caught stamping in on a trail.

I can't answer the question about what to say at Gathers as I have never been <br/>
asked during them.  I'm guessing it depends on the situation which can be <br/>
different each time an encounter with a muggle occurs.  I was off trail once <br/>
looking for a box and a hiker stopped and asked what I was doing.  I said I was <br/>
looking at the flora and fauna.  Other times when letterboxing with a group, <br/>
we've said we're doing a scavenger hunt.  One time at the Disney park, the guard <br/>
who checks your bags looked at my colored pens and sketchbook asked if I was an <br/>
artist.  Yup!  Sounds like you're being creative with it, but don't be too <br/>
specific or you'll run into those "experts" who will quiz you more...  ; )   As <br/>
far as your manhood is concerned, I'm not going there.  lol<br/>
<br/>
enjoy~<br/>

  <br/>
Not sure if anyone even looks at this List anymore but thought I would ask a <br/>
question anyway. Every year when I host our LB Event I get asked by Park people <br/>
and other curious onlookers what our group represents. In the beginning I told <br/>
the truth and tried to explain letterboxing, but I quickly realized this caused <br/>
more questions than I was prepared to answer and besides, I value the secrecy of <br/>
letterboxing too much to expose it that way. For several years after that I <br/>
would say we were a reunion of friends, and this worked ok but still did not <br/>
explain why we were busily stamping into logbooks. Next I tried saying we were a <br/>
craft club. This explained our activities in the building but not on the trails. <br/>
Also, I got some strange looks from guy rangers obviously questioning my <br/>
manhood. This is Texas after all. This year I was thinking of saying we are a <br/>
Nature club. It would explain being on the trails and the logbooks could be <br/>
notes on our nature<br/>
finds. Of course this could backfire like it did for me one time when caught <br/>
stamping in on a trail. Usually people will glance at you warily but continue <br/>
on, but this person stopped and asked what I was doing. I quickly said I was <br/>
taking notes on a bird I just heard so I could look it up when I got home. She <br/>
then told me she was a birder and asked a bunch of questions about the bird and <br/>
I had to imitate and describe this fictitious bird for 10 minutes!<br/>
<br/>
So what would you say if asked what your letterbox group is?<br/>

The Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife website lists a "Letterboxing 101" course that was held at a couple of parks last June. Plus they seem extremely geocache-friendly. Maybe tell park guys that you're "letterboxing--it's like geocaching only with clues instead of GPS coordinates." For other folks, probably the scavenger hunt comparison will give them the most context.<br/>
Shebalooking forward to visiting Texas again :D<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last event I organized was at a fairly small private campground, and I felt compelled to tell the campground owners exactly what our group was doing.  They were so interested in the activity they arranged for the community newspaper to have a reporter come there and interview some of us.  If I didn't have to tell I wouldn't, just because it's a fairly complicated thing to explain.  Scavenger hunt is something everyone knows, that's my first choice to tell when there are questions:  "We are a hiking group and have organized a get-together with a sort of scavenger hunt as our main activity this year."<br/>
<br/>
I also really like the explanation someone else threw out - hiking and logging into points along the way to prove we've been there.<br/>
<br/>
Neither explanation is a lie, both are very simple to understand.  Both explain why there are crazy people wandering around on the trails with their compasses looking confused. :)<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, I probably didn't even have to tell the park owners all about letterboxing - they would have been satisfied with either of the other two explanations.<br/>
