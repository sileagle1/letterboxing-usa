                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
As promised, here's a recap of our LB exploits from our recent <br/>
sojourn into Southern Cal the last 2 weeks of Jan.<br/>
<br/>
Fresno Water Tower - intact and in a neat spot! (First finders)<br/>
Mooneys Grove - great box in a great little park! Again exactly where <br/>
the clues led - (first finders, and picked up the Quail HH as a <br/>
bonus!!)<br/>
Eldorado Series - Super park in Long Beach! Boxes 1, 2 and 5 were <br/>
right were the clues advertised - Boxes 2 and 3 are missing (but not <br/>
confirmed yet) <br/>
Really White By Day Blue By Night - superb stamp in a really neat <br/>
spot on the Long Beach pier<br/>
Marina Pacifica Plumbing Problem - a super box in a really novel <br/>
hiding spot!<br/>
<br/>
Lincoln Mouse (Disneyland) Toast. If the box was there, it's been <br/>
knocked down into the wall.<br/>
Choo Chew (Disneyland) More than likely toast. The location has been <br/>
closed off to the public in preparation for renovation/construction. <br/>
We're thinking that if anyone did get that, count themselves very <br/>
fortunate!)<br/>
<br/>
Coldwater Canyon Series -<br/>
Box 1 - still there, but the box has been gnawed by a furry friend, <br/>
most likely.<br/>
Boxes 2 and 3 - both missing and likely gone for good.<br/>
Box 4 - still in place and in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
Pelican and Shore Bird - Huntington Beach<br/>
Both gone (Shore Bird has been replaced) but still a very nice walk <br/>
along the beach and inland salt marsh! We loved the diving pelicans!<br/>
<br/>
La Jolla - great spot!<br/>
Santee Lakes - Erica (Ms Jiggs #1) found this box by accident after <br/>
we "experienced" types spent an hour of fruitless searching!  <br/>
Old San Diego - box is missing, but enjoyed the area immensely!<br/>
Shelter Island - found this box in the dark! Had to fight off the <br/>
wharf rats, but we prevailed in the end!!  <br/>
<br/>
La Sierra - Riverside - Our first trek onto a University campus! We <br/>
found the box in plain view sitting on a picnic table! Some other <br/>
first timers had already logged in, and left the box probably where <br/>
the groundskeepers left it! (We replanted the box in its original <br/>
spot!<br/>
<br/>
Ryan's Grandpappy - Calico - if you ever have the chance, visit this <br/>
bona fide ghost town in the Sierras! We had a blast finding the box <br/>
and touring the town!<br/>
<br/>
Triangle Building - Las Vegas - great spot! We literally parked on <br/>
top of it!<br/>
Captain's Jewel - intact and begging to be visited!<br/>
Pirates Booty - great box<br/>
Three Cherries/Press Your Luck - gone.<br/>
Las Vegas Boneyard - took us two days to figure out the clues, but <br/>
well worth the effort! Excellent carving!<br/>
One-armed bandit- searched for 45 minutes but no luck. We had to <br/>
start back west so this will have to wait til neext time.<br/>
Desert Duo #1 - again took two attempts - first time was too dark to <br/>
climb. Excellent rock carving by Wanda and Pete! We also picked up <br/>
the Poppin Away HH to cap off a great LB trip!<br/>
<br/>
I will be writing the planters individually as well.<br/>

Hi Pete,<br/>
<br/>
Me and boychek (my son, the pirate) are thrilled you found some of our boxes.  I'm <br/>
especially pleased you found the Boneyard one...fun to carve and hide.  I'm also glad <br/>
you found Poppin' Away, since I was the one who left it there at Desert Duo #1.<br/>
<br/>
One-armed bandit is tricky because of the crabgrass overgrowing the plaque on the <br/>
tree.  I've never successfully found Three Cherries either...I think it's long gone, <br/>
although I found the velcro!<br/>
<br/>
Glad you had fun getting off the Strip in Las Vegas.  More to come!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Hey Jiggs family and suzanne,<br/>
We were just there too and didn't find this one either. Looked like the area was <br/>
recently groomed too. Not that many leaves on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
We tried for Captain's Jewel too but I think we took a wrong turn.<br/>
<br/>
So the only stamp I got on our trip to Vegas was the National park stamp out at Lake <br/>
Mead. Oh well...it was a fun trip anyway.<br/>
