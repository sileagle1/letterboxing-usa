This should be of greatest interest to those of you living in New England, though...  The clue change is as follows:     As winter turned to spring, Beldin shook the last snow from his shoulders, resumed his human form and brushed the worst of the clinging dirt from his well-worn but exceedingly comfortable pants. "Four months is long enough to stay in a single place, even one as pretty as this. I feel the need for some social interaction". He yawned, stretched and hiked his way out to the nearest highway to garner a ride...    <br/>

"Over 500 miles in a single day -- pretty good time for a tough old bird", he thought to himself. "I think I'll take the time to enjoy myself and see the country by hitching rides for a while. It's been a long while since I visited the great north woods, and who better for company than a garrulous old irish crow..." <br/>
