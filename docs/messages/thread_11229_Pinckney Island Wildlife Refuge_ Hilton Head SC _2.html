                    <div class="plaintext-content">My granddaughter and I have placed 2 new boxes on Pinckney Island <br/>
near Hilton Head SC. The entrance to PI is off of Hwy 278 between the <br/>
2 bridges to Hilton Head Island. We call these boxes Pinckney blue <br/>
and Pinckney white and you have to find blue first before you can <br/>
find white. It doesn't have to be on the same trip but if you don't <br/>
know the location of the blue box, the first clue for the white box <br/>
doesn't tell you anything. PI has many miles of trails, beautiful <br/>
views, birds and other wildlife....had to give a small gator a wide <br/>
berth when we placed these boxes. Pinckney blue is a 5 mile round <br/>
trip hike and you can add 2 more miles to it if you want to continue <br/>
on to the white box. The trails are bicycle friendly (except after a <br/>
couple of days of heavy rain), but no pets are allowed in the refuge.<br/>
The first clue for both boxes is posted here, after that you have to <br/>
find the next clue and follow the instructions. You will always <br/>
travel in the same direction until you find the box. The clues may <br/>
appear vague or enigmatic, fear not, with moderate vigilance all will <br/>
be clear.<br/>
Pinckney Blue-Clue #1<br/>
Follow the gravel road until you are standing between 2 single trees. <br/>
Next to 1 of the trees is a small island. Visit the big brother of <br/>
that tree. He lives on the small island.<br/>
