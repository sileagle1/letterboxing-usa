<br/>
Here's my first try at placing a letterbox (not counting the hitchhiker I<br/>
dropped a few weeks ago). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Champ - The Lake Champlain Monster<br/>
Ferrisburg, VT<br/>
Addison County<br/>

     Long before the white men came, long before the people knew to record<br/>
time, stories were told of large creatures living in the dark, cold waters<br/>
of the big lake. <br/>
     The Iroquois told stories of a horned serpent, periodically seen rising<br/>
to the surface.<br/>
     The European who has lent his name to the lake reported seeing it.<br/>
Modern reports date back to the 1870s and continue to the present day. <br/>
     Each year, more eyewitness reports add to the mystery. <br/>
<br/>
     Go to the southwestern-most cove in Kingsland Bay.<br/>
Stand at the waters edge, at the center of the beach.<br/>
Over your left shoulder is a large, old tree with two trunks.<br/>
A piles of stones at the base of the tree covers what you seek.<br/>
<br/>
(If the season is right, bring your bathing suit and a picnic lunch.)<br/>

<br/>
    I can hardly believe it - we were at that beach last night for the<br/>
first time!  It's a good place to launch a canoe and we went north up<br/>
the bay and east around McDonough's point.<br/>
<br/>
Erik and I plan to give the clue to our son (10) and one of his<br/>
letterboxing buddies to find.  As Cub Scouts they need more map reading<br/>
skills.  Perhaps Ben will figure it out by remembering where he was, but<br/>
I think the canoe held most of his interest.  We look forward to more<br/>
boxes and we thank you for offering a bit of diversion.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Susan<br/>

I was there Saturday, with a bunch of amateur boatbuilders (one of my other<br/>
hobbies/obsessions). They were also there Sunday, but I had to leave early.<br/>
<br/>
So, you were literally no more than 20 feet from a brand new letterbox!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I have a little boat I keep in McNeil Cove in Charlotte....I hope to sail up<br/>
and find the Valcour Island letterboxes some day.<br/>
<br/>
I would be pleased to get a "critique" from you on my stamp and the box, it<br/>
being my first.  Also, I didn't have time to print out any "What is<br/>
Letterboxing" pages, so if you have a few, you could give them to your son<br/>
and have him leave them in the box.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
