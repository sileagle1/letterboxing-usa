Even though this is a micro box it is the longest stamp I ever made, <br/>
or seen.  If you stand it on end it is as tall as the Empire State <br/>
Building.  It has a special feature, an idea I copied from a recent <br/>
stamp I've encountered.  It's only my second "positive image" stamp <br/>
and my first pink rubber material stamp that wasn't an eraser.  I am <br/>
not sure how much I like the pink rubber since it is not as hard as <br/>
I'd like.  Happy hunting.<br/>

March 8th, 1862, fictional, mystery novel, union spy Harrison <br/>
Raines' investigation of the murder of President Lincoln's close <br/>
friend Colonel and Senator Edward Baker during the battle of Balls <br/>
Bluff has miraculously and fascinatingly led him aboard the <br/>
launching of the first ironcald warship, the former Union U.S.S. <br/>
Merrimack, now the C.S.S. Virginia, to witness the sinking or <br/>
wrecking of three helpless wooden Union warships that terrifies the <br/>
Union cause.  <br/>
<br/>
Little more than 100 days earlier, rejected by the Union Navy <br/>
because his design was considered too outlandish, John Ericsson <br/>
meets personally with Abraham Lincoln to plead for his gun turret on <br/>
an iron shingle.  Convinced, over the Naval commander's objections, <br/>
Lincoln orders the bizarre ship built.  They retaliate by writing <br/>
into the contract that it must be completed within 100 days or the <br/>
contract is void.  Constructed in nine different foundries at once, <br/>
John Ericsson completes the U.S.S. Monitor in time to save the Union.<br/>
<br/>
John Ericsson's design saved the union.  His invention populated <br/>
America.  Clumsy, dangerous, side paddle wheel, wooden steamers <br/>
would now evolve into ocean liners.  (In those days people still <br/>
thought of ships as having sails.  The new ships that belched smoke <br/>
were called steamers, as in "steamer trunk".)  A grateful populace <br/>
erected a grand, artistic monument to the designer, the inventor, <br/>
the Union savior, in the nation's capital that his name and his work <br/>
might not be forgotten.  It is one of those out of the way monuments <br/>
over awed by the larger grander ones.  No one pays any attention to <br/>
it.  I didn't remember the inventor's name until I got there.  His <br/>
invention is completely taken for granted.  Most people even call it <br/>
by the wrong name, one properly used for aeroplanes.<br/>
<br/>
Directly south of the Lincoln Memorial look for a marble memorial in <br/>
the middle of a small traffic circle.  <br/>
<br/>
Notice the allegorical representations of adventure, labor and <br/>
vision.  Now you must learn your compass points.  Before we marked a <br/>
compass into 360 degrees mariners had to learn the 32 points of the <br/>
compass rose.  Here are the first 9 as a sample.  North, N by E, <br/>
NNE, NE by N, NE, NE by E, ENE, E by N, East.  The compass point S <br/>
by W points directly towards the dual film cannister microbox.  Sit <br/>
on the steps and no one will notice you reaching under the leaves <br/>
under the bushes.  Please replace it carefully, hidden from view <br/>
under the leaves, so it is not mistaken for trash.<br/>
<br/>
So what did John Ericsson invent?  For extra credit guess which is <br/>
what is pictured on the stamp and what was it's affectionate <br/>
nickname (not to be confused with it's sister letterbox down near <br/>
Fort McNair where Lincoln assassination conspirator Mary Surratt was <br/>
hanged)?  Write to me at theDoubtfulGuests@yahoo.com with your <br/>
answer or if this micro letterbox is lost, damaged or the log is <br/>
full or if you object to my run away run on sentences, too many <br/>
connections or the shameless plugs of the Apple Dumpling Gang's <br/>
letterbox at Balls Bluff, of Harrison Raines mystery novels and my <br/>
other letterbox, Ghost of the _______.<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to enjoy the walk and the view along the river.  You are in <br/>
walking distance from a few other letterboxes including Skull and <br/>
Bones,  Independence Microbox, and Orion the Hunter depending on how <br/>
far you like to walk.<br/>
