very easy box.  I loved the stamp -- it was one of my favorites!<br/>
<br/>
However, it was balanced by Indian Creek, a very stenuous but <br/>
rewarding box in Hood River.<br/>
<br/>
We had the most trouble finding Union &amp; 11th:  "I've lived here 18 <br/>
years and I don't know where Union is."<br/>
<br/>
If we had looked at a map . . . When we found the streets, the clues <br/>
were wonderful, very accurate and clear.<br/>
<br/>
The spur trail was extremely steep and slippery with dry dirt.  But <br/>
going down was worth it: the box was fun, it was well hidden and the <br/>
stamp was great.  This is definitely not a box that will be found by <br/>
a passer-by but only by boxers!<br/>
