and teach everyone, it sounds like such fun.  I was really impressed, however, <br/>
to see the folks on this list are around my age!!  I don't know what I was <br/>
thinkin but I was so glad to see for myself all the "gray hair" crowd!  <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to the Ohio Gathering on June 15 - being a "newbie" I hope to <br/>
meet those folks whose signatures I have been seeing for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for a great picture album and site to reference on occasion!<br/>
