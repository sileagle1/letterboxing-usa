I've had multiple requests to add regional lists to this list's main page.  <br/>
What I did was create a folder under the links section for this purpose.  <br/>
This seems the most logical.  Feel free to add your regional list there, <br/>
tho I have added some already that were specifically requested in one of<br/>
the requests.<br/>
<br/>
I had a second request that people respect the default Yahoo ordering of <br/>
this links page (alphabetical), and have made changes to bring this <br/>
page into compliance with this request, since that seems fair to me.  I agree <br/>
that I don't want people playing games on this page to promote their site <br/>
at the top (commercial or otherwise), at the expense of other peoples' sites.<br/>
No site is deemed to be more important than any other.  Go play these games <br/>
with Google.<br/>
<br/>
(If you want to play games by calling your site Aaaron's Letterboxing Page,<br/>
and your name isn't Aaaron, fine, but life is about line drawing, and<br/>
that is where this line is being drawn.)<br/>
<br/>
(please don't turn these two decisions into a trollfest; I just work here :-))<br/>
<br/>
I know I had another reuqest, but I have misplaced it.  Sorry :)<br/>
<br/>
(and apologies for the delays; I'm busy and buffer requests.  Better service<br/>
may be achieved by posting to the moderator e-mail rather than directly to <br/>
me) <br/>

Cheers<br/>
