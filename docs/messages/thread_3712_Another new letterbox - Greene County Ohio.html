Location: Greene County Ohio<br/>
Placed 14 Nov 2001<br/>
Distance:  mile round trip from parking<br/>

No need to get your feet muddy here. This park is a wetlands park you <br/>
can explore on a boardwalk. It is a great place to go birding or see <br/>
some of the wetlands grasses without mucking about in the goo. <br/>
"The Fen" is on Fairgrounds Road.<br/>
<br/>
Great for strollers or even wheelchairs. You can get to within 60 <br/>
feet of the cache without leaving the boardwalk. Even then you do not <br/>
need to get your feet wet. It will be obvious where you should leave <br/>
the prepared path.   Just go to N 39 44.530 W 084 00.541. <br/>
<br/>
Cache/letterbox contains toys for boys and girls of all ages.  More <br/>
details and hints can be found by looking for placename GC26D2 on the <br/>
www.geocaching.com website.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry to say that I have not fished the stream along the first <br/>
part of the path. Looks like a few bluegills could be pulled out of <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun in this park which remains easy when all the other trails <br/>
will leave your shoes caked with mud.<br/>
