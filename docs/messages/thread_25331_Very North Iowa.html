one in nowhere Nebraska that has sparse finds, but does have finds. But<br/>
even the one I have in Grand Island has few finds; which surprised me being<br/>
that near the interstate.<br/>

more northeast, you'd probably have finders from Iowa, MN, WI and IL.  I<br/>
have a box in NE Iowa that I planted in 2005 and it usually gets a couple of<br/>
finders each year.<br/>

I have been researching places for a middle of nowhere cemetery series. It<br/>
