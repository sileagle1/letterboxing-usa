Be careful if you do a search for fun foam, as I discovered, they also call another product "fun foam", but that's sold in an entirely DIFFERENT kind of store. LOL<br/>

I just tried it, and I'm very pleased with the end result, I'm just wondering how well it will hold up.  I know that under great pressure it will eventually flatten out.  The only reason I know this is I had a table that was making dents in our vinyl flooring and I tried using a circle of fun foam under the foot.  Eventually the foam was flattened out to about 1/32 of an inch, but I don't suppose stamps will ever suffer that much pressure.<br/>
<br/>
While it's not truly "carveable" (sp?), it works for our block letters and alphabet font, as long as we don't get too fancy.  Our attempts are not particularly artistic, I guess you could say we're going for the folk art, crude/crafty look.<br/>
<br/>
I've mounted them on some wooden circles I had lying around and have access to literally hundreds.  What was the concensus on mounting adhesive?<br/>

<br/>
I'm not sure if it's the exact same stuff, but Der Mad Stamper placed <br/>
a bunch of foam stamps.  We heckled him a bit for it because they <br/>
were generally very poor for caving and we knew he could carve some <br/>
true masterpieces.  So in a nutshell, yes, foam has been used for <br/>
stamps before, although they don't tend to be very popular since only <br/>
the simplest of stamps can be carved.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I'm just wondering how well it will hold up.<br/>
<br/>
The ones I've seen have held up pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I've mounted them on some wooden circles I had lying around and <br/>
&gt; have access to literally hundreds.  What was the concensus on<br/>
&gt; mounting adhesive?<br/>
<br/>
The concensus?  Hahahahaha!  There is no concensus for mounting <br/>
adhesives.  =)<br/>
<br/>
But those foam stamps are so floppy, they definitely need a good <br/>
mounting.  (I may not like stamps mounted as a general rule, but <br/>
there are exceptions and foam stamps are definitely one of them!)<br/>

The one problem I've had with foam stamps is their tendency to absorb way too much <br/>
ink. I've had foam stamps end up soaking through the page in my logbook. Not my <br/>
favorite medium... Funhog<br/>

Hmmm....  Interesting.  I got that letterbox and it was actually a <br/>
store-bought stamp.  (Can you believe DMS would sink so low?!)  He <br/>
must have replaced it with a foam stamp since I last found it.  (This <br/>
was back in 2001 when letterboxing wasn't even a twinkle in your <br/>
eye.  *wink*)<br/>
