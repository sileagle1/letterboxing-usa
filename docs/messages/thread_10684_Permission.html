                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was just straight forward when I asked the University of Washington <br/>
permission to place in the experimental forest in Washington state.<br/>
<br/>
I sent an e mail to the director of the facility.  I introduced <br/>
myself and said I was a letterboxer interested in placing some boxes <br/>
at the Pack Forect.  I included a link to the LbNA site and did a <br/>
brief discription of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I made sure I emphasized the Golden Rule of leave no trace, do no <br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
I told them what my theme was ( natural history ) and the approximate <br/>
size of a potential box.  I mentioned where boxes were typically <br/>
hidden in this region ( under fallen logs and in natural cavities at <br/>
bases of trees)  <br/>
<br/>
In closeing I said I would be happy to answer questions or meet <br/>
directly with them if they had any questions.  I told them, if <br/>
permission was given that I would check in with them to make sure <br/>
that I knew about any sensitive areas they wanted me to avoid etc.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out they had heard about LB and were very happy and eager to be <br/>
of help.<br/>
<br/>
So If all comes right I will go scout the venue on Presidents Day <br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
