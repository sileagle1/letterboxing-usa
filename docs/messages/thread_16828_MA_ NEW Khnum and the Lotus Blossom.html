Granville Gorge<br/>
Southwick, MA (Hampden County)<br/>
<br/>
Placed: Nov. 12, 2003 by TehutiKa, AsetKa and kids! <br/>
Distance: less than 1/2 mile<br/>
Time: 30 minutes or so...if you can resist simply<br/>
sitting and staring...<br/>
Difficulty: Narrative Clue. Two boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: The Granville Gorge is just off Rt. 57 in<br/>
Southwick, on the way to Granville. The sign sneaks up<br/>
on you, on the right side of the road, and is easy to<br/>
miss. Granville Gorge is a great little park, just<br/>
barely on the Southwick side of the line. It is owned<br/>
by the town, and administered by the Conservation<br/>
Commission. The parking lot is very rocky, as is the<br/>
entire site, so please be careful driving in. As<br/>
always, please rehide carefully. <br/>
<br/>
Clue:<br/>
<br/>
This is the story as it was told to me.<br/>
<br/>
Khnum, the Celestial Potter, sat in His workshop at<br/>
the source of the Nile. Every day, for years upon<br/>
years, He sat in His workshop, creating the bodies of<br/>
all of the children being born. Each one different,<br/>
each one special, never a duplicate. <br/>
<br/>
Until today.<br/>
<br/>
Khnum found himself holding an exact duplicate. He<br/>
knew it was. He never forgot any of His creations.<br/>
Surprised, He remolded it, and began anew. And created<br/>
the same duplicate again! And again, and again, and<br/>
again!!<br/>
<br/>
Amazed, Khnum pushed away from His pottery wheel.<br/>
Never before had this happened. The very idea was<br/>
unthinkable. Khnum had lost His inspiration! He could<br/>
no longer create, and if He could not create new<br/>
bodies, how would any babies be born?<br/>
<br/>
"Trouble?", said a voice behind him. Khnum turned, and<br/>
saw Bes, the dwarven God of Laughter, standing in the<br/>
window. The ram-headed god nodded. "I know what you<br/>
need.", replied the little man. "Follow me!"<br/>
<br/>
The little god led Khnum to a strange land, far from<br/>
the lush valley of the Nile. He led the Father of<br/>
Fathers to another river, a smaller one, in a much<br/>
colder place. But this one felt strangely familiar.<br/>
Though small, it was much like one of the numerous<br/>
cataracts that span the length of the river, where the<br/>
mighty river turns to rapids. Khnum found Himself<br/>
smiling as he stood beside this small rushing river.<br/>
He turned to Bes, asking, "Is this what you meant,<br/>
Little One?"<br/>
<br/>
In the clearing behind him, Bes crouched in the<br/>
branches of a mighty tree. "No, Lord of the Silt, this<br/>
is not what you need. What you need is to be put out<br/>
to pasture with the ewes!"<br/>
<br/>
How could this little creature say such things to Him?<br/>
Enraged, Khnum lowered His horns and charged the tree.<br/>
With a mighty crash, He broke it in two! Part of the<br/>
trunk remained standing, the rest fell to the forest<br/>
floor. Khnum had smashed it so hard that He left an<br/>
imprint of himself in the bark!<br/>
<br/>
Khnum heard laughter coming from behind Him, farther<br/>
up the trail. The vile little man stood, laughing<br/>
still, between the trunks of a double tree, upon a<br/>
rock. Determined to catch the dwarf, Khnum charged<br/>
across the clearing and leapt at the gap in the tree.<br/>
But the little man scampered out of the way as Khnum<br/>
came crashing to the ground next to the rock. But He<br/>
saw something there that shocked and surprised the old<br/>
god. In this cold, strange land, so far from home, He<br/>
saw a perfect lotus blossom, growing in the shelter of<br/>
the stone.<br/>
<br/>
Bes came and knelt beside the prone body of Khnum.<br/>
"This is what you need, Potter of Gods. You need to<br/>
find inspiration where you least expect it."<br/>
<br/>
Khnum understood. Gathering Himself, He nodded His<br/>
thanks to Bes. With a renewed sense of purpose, Khnum<br/>
returned to His workshop, leaving the lotus behind, as<br/>
inspiration for others. As for Bes, He stayed behind,<br/>
watching the river for a short time, before wandering<br/>
off to find more mischief....but that is another story....<br/>
