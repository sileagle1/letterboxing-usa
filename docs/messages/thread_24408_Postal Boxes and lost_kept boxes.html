&gt;&gt;   Being part of PLBing means that you must be prepared that there's a<br/>
&gt;&gt;   possibility your box will get lost.  This can happen if the box is<br/>
&gt;&gt;   planted in the wild too.  Out of the 5 Lord of the Rings boxes - 2<br/>
&gt;&gt;   went missing.  Out of the 60 boxes or so that I planted in the  <br/>
&gt;&gt; wild,<br/>
&gt;&gt;   1 went missing.  I feel a lot safer planting my boxes then mailing<br/>
&gt;&gt;   them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wow.  I would not have expected that.  I would have expected that a<br/>
&gt; lost PLB would be a rare thing indeed.  I wouldn't expect the USPS to<br/>
&gt; lose more than one out of a thousand.  And I wouldn't expect anyone<br/>
&gt; who actually signs up for a PLB to somehow lose it while it's in<br/>
&gt; their possession.  What do you think happened to the two PLB's that<br/>
&gt; went missing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hate to even suggest that any letterboxers might be less than<br/>
&gt; honest, but is there any possibility that a boxer just decided to<br/>
&gt; keep a box?  And if this ever happens, is there a way to blacklist<br/>
&gt; these people so nobody sends them any more PLB's?<br/>
<br/>
It happens. The one and only stamp I've lost was one I sent to  <br/>
someone who seems like a fairly responsible LBer otherwise. Checking  <br/>
in every few  months, I got promises that it'd be returned and emails  <br/>
saying they'd forgotten to mail it, but they'd do it soon - it was  <br/>
packed up and sitting there ready to go. Now all I get is radio  <br/>
silence in response to polite emails. Given that it was the first  <br/>
stamp I released into the wild (it was actually planted, then  <br/>
retrieved, as part of a group deal that never really materialized  <br/>
completely), it's annoying that I'll never see the logbook, but I  <br/>
guess that a few years into this wonderful hobby, I'm resigned to the  <br/>
fact that not everyone is as conscientious as everyone else.<br/>

Wow.  They even confirmed that they HAD it, and promised to ship it, <br/>
and then didn't?  That's really amazing.<br/>
<br/>
It does seem as though there should be some way to warn others not to <br/>
send a PLB to these guys.<br/>

As was mentioned before, many people who become black holes have been <br/>
responsible PLb-ers for some time, until a life event happens to <br/>
them. And again, some people get overwhelmed in their enthusiasm, and <br/>
either for time or $$$ purposes just shut down. Much of the time they <br/>
are too embarassed or overwhelmed to come forward again, even to <br/>
respond to people who want to help. This is just human nature. <br/>
Sometimes they later will contact the PLb list--we tend to be pretty <br/>
forgiving in these cases. <br/>
<br/>
I think it is rare that someone sees a nice box and just decides to <br/>
keep it.<br/>
<br/>
The PLb community has come up with several ways to work with black <br/>
holes. There is the "rescue" of boxes mentioned earlier. The PLb <br/>
yahoo group has a database where, if you know you are having an <br/>
issue, you can request that people not send to you, or where people <br/>
can list boxers that have not been heard from in a while. And most of <br/>
those who create and moderate rings know about those who are in <br/>
trouble and adjust accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
Black hole patterns are similar over time--it is usually the same <br/>
kinds of circumstances that lead to them. PLb-ers are careful to warn <br/>
new people about getting overwhelmed with too many PLbs, but that <br/>
still does happen. However, it is next to impossible to predict to <br/>
whom a death or a divorce or cancer or elder care issues, or an <br/>
accident, or another life issue is going to strike next. And that is <br/>
why black holes are a factor that has to be taken into account if one <br/>
wants to do PLbs.<br/>
<br/>
My best advice is that PLbs are probably not for those who are so <br/>
attached to their work that they'd be deeply hurt if it were to go <br/>
missing. But isn't that true also of letterboxing in general?<br/>
