Part of the Texas History Series<br/>
<br/>
Independence was founded in 1823 as Coles Settlement, and renamed in <br/>
1836 in honor of the March 2nd Declaration of Independence for <br/>
Texas.  Know as the "Athens of Texas", it was the early center of <br/>
education, culture and religion.  The ruins of the original Baylor <br/>
College are still here.  Sam Houston, the 1st President of Texas and <br/>
hero of the Battle of San Jacinto, converted to the Baptist faith in <br/>
the Independence Baptist Church (the oldest Baptist congregation <br/>
still in existence), and was baptized in the waters of Rocky Creek <br/>
nearby.  To celebrate the occasion, his mother-in-law, Nancy Lea, <br/>
bought a bell for the church tower, which can be seen in the <br/>
historical center next to the church.  Also near the church is the <br/>
tiny Houston family cemetery where Margaret Lea Houston (Sam's wife) <br/>
was hastily buried after her death from yellow fever in 1867.  Nancy <br/>
Lea is also buried here.  A few steps away is the home where Margaret <br/>
moved after Sam's death in 1863.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
The "Sam Houston Trail" letterbox is located in Old Baylor Park, west <br/>
of Independence.  From Brenham, take Hwy 105 northwest, turning left <br/>
on FM 50 just out of town.  Follow FM 50 to Independence, turning <br/>
left on FM 360. Go about  mile to West Spur 390, going right on this <br/>
road.  You will see the columns of Old Baylor straight ahead.  Park <br/>
in front of the columns.<br/>
