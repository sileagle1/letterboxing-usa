our 1st Colorado RMLetterboxing Gathering was better!<br/>
<br/>
A quick recap for those that couldn't attend ...<br/>
<br/>
We met at the visitor's center for Roxborough State Park only to <br/>
discover that there isn't a picnic table ANYWHERE in the park. <br/>
However, we had food and were not to be dissuaded from eating! So we <br/>
spread out on a bench, and did some meet &amp; greet, took photos and <br/>
such. (I hope to post some soon)<br/>
<br/>
Then we headed up the trail to the Fountain Valley Letterbox (planted <br/>
way back in '00 by the Drew Clan). Up there at the overlook, we all <br/>
stamped into the box, passed around the American Pride HH (sent from <br/>
Buffy of the Travelin' Trouts) and made exchanges all around. My <br/>
personal traveller made its debut, and our little event stamp will <br/>
soon be turned into a new hitchhiker!<br/>
<br/>
Dixie was effervescent - bringing several friends with her that were <br/>
new to boxing --- Jill, Jim &amp; Cathy, and Laura (YaYa). I think she's <br/>
trying to single-handedly convert everyone she knows to the hobby! <br/>
Eoghan and his beautiful fiance' Pumpkin Princess were there, as were <br/>
Fiona &amp; Joe. Lisa (Tie-Dye Gal) and her daughter Nicole came, and <br/>
the prize for longest distance travelled to get to the gathering goes <br/>
to Guara &amp; The Foreman (and hubby John) who drove all the way in from <br/>
Monument! <br/>
<br/>
We all decided we can't wait to do it again, but we'll choose a park <br/>
that allows DAWGS next time!! :) <br/>
<br/>
Happy to have met everyone!<br/>
