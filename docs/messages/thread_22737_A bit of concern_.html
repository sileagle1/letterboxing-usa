                    <div class="plaintext-content">Unforunately, living in new hampshire, for the past several weeks, <br/>
it as rained and it has poured. my efforts to letterbox has been <br/>
hampered by swollen water ways and flooded paths. my concern lies <br/>
with any or all boxes that maybe prone to flood waters of every <br/>
sort. the thought of going out to search for a letterbox that <br/>
doesn't exist, is not a thought i really enjoy thinking about. if i <br/>
may send out this message to all letterboxers, that you check up on <br/>
your boxes placed. if you know of boxes in your town even if they <br/>
don't belong to you, to please check on them and report to the <br/>
placer. i would hate for the art of letterboxing to go with the <br/>
weather. i plan on doing my part to rebuild new hampshire, one box <br/>
at a time.<br/>

<br/>
p.s.<br/>
i apoligze in advance for not mentioning the unfortunate owners of <br/>
any property, damaged or lost, in the floods of new hampshire. the <br/>
hardest hit area is the south west corner of our wonderful state. as <br/>
i have, if you would like to help in any way, please donate whatever <br/>
you can to the american red cross, designated for the new hampshire <br/>
floods. you and i may not have been affected by the floods directly, <br/>
but we all are affected in some way or another. thank you.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We checked our box in Bradford Pines in NH this weekend and this box was <br/>
pulled due to water damage.  I believe that the Pier Bridge &amp;  the other one along <br/>
the same route must also have water damage since they are on the bridge over <br/>
the Sugar River. The road was closed &amp; we were not able to get to them.  <br/>
RoseMary's shower in Sunapee should be ok and maybe Mary's Lamb.  We live on Long <br/>
Island, New York and get up to NH once or twice a year, so if anyone can check <br/>
on the boxes  I would appreciate it. My daughter lives in Newport &amp; can check <br/>
on boxes on the weekends when time allows.<br/>
<br/>
We did go to Pillsbury Park and did get one of the 7 series.  It was dirty &amp; <br/>
damp out side the box but the stamp was fine.  Could not go on since we had to <br/>
go to see my granddaughter cheer at the football game in Peterbough.  We were <br/>
up to celebrate birthdays too .<br/>

and the dam breaking. there is a lot of boxes in the<br/>
hillsboro/washington/henniker etc. area planted by rtrw and uneksia. it<br/>
would be wise to not plan on searching for them until i have a chance to<br/>
check them out. hopefully this week or weekend. we lost our furnace in the<br/>
floods so are dealing with no heat right now and some foundation damage. i<br/>
will also be checking on any other boxes that could have been damaged or<br/>
lost in the floods. will make a report as soon as the water recedes enough<br/>
to get to the spots. <br/>
