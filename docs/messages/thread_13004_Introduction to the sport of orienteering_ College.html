Have you ever seen a person in the woods running with a map <br/>
and compass? Do you know why he or she was crossing those <br/>
wet swamps, climbing hills, running straight through the woods <br/>
as if the trails did not exist? Then maybe you noticed red and <br/>
white flags `hidden' in the woods at various features such as <br/>
bolder, pit, tip of a draw, top of the hill, etc.? All these and a few <br/>
other elements make a great outdoor activity of the sport of <br/>
orienteering. This class provides an introduction to the <br/>
orienteering sport. Learn about the elements of recreational <br/>
outdoor activity involving detailed map and compass work. In this <br/>
class you will be taught how to navigate through the woods and <br/>
find precise locations based on your knowledge of the map and <br/>
terrain. You will also find out about the history of the sport, its <br/>
various modifications, and opportunities to attend events locally <br/>
and nationally. At the end of this lecture you will be prepared to <br/>
go out in the woods and do your first orienteering course. <br/>
