actual Find was a mystery box up in Maine. It's located in a place near <br/>
and dear to my heart, so I recognized some of the landmarks as soon as <br/>
I read the clue and was thrilled to find it during a trip back to that <br/>
location. That's about all I can say about the box itself without <br/>
giving it away and it's too much fun to figure out. :-)<br/>
