Thanks for the support.  There will be more interesting<br/>
and usefull items to come.  If you carve with PZ Cut,<br/>
which Bill really likes, we've come across a great<br/>
new rigid stabilizer to mount as a backer to rubber stamps.  <br/>
It's lightweight, waterproof, has great adhesive properties, and<br/>
even comes in colors.  As soon as we get the sizes, etc. organized,<br/>
we'll list it. <br/>
