Dilemma though, the log book has only a few pages left and I was<br/>
wondering if I should just add a second log book, and call it , 2nd<br/>
Addition or log book #2, and keep both in the LB. Or should I archive the<br/>
1st , here at home. No, I will do the first. There is plenty of room.<br/>
Actually some LBer put a yellow plastic flashlight in the plastic box.<br/>
Seems like many find this LB when having to find a place to pee!  Ha! Or<br/>
they are looking for a close-by geo-cache. Its a funny thing to "turn on"<br/>
so many to letterboxing because of those two unrelated things. Anyway,<br/>
for the record:  Peeing outdoes "looking for geo-caches"<br/>
