Some may not agree with my thoughts, and that is fine (I will try to <br/>
avoid your boxes in the future since they probably will not be found <br/>
anyway).   Here it goes:<br/>
<br/>
1) Write your clues as if you are not from the area.  When an out of <br/>
state boxer is looking for a street in a large town, with no other <br/>
reference point, it wastes a lot of time.  Also turns off new boxers <br/>
if they can't even find where to start from.   Suggest you give <br/>
directions on how to get to starting place for hike.<br/>
<br/>
2) Give a starting place.  Clues are worthless if you don't even <br/>
know where the person started from.  "The Parking Lot" may be good <br/>
enough, unless it is bigger than a football field, or if you give a <br/>
clue like in #3.<br/>
<br/>
3) Give more specific directions.  "From the parking lot, go <br/>
Southwest to the cliff, and look under a rock" is a huge area to <br/>
cover.  Spent an hour on one of these, and never did find the box.<br/>
<br/>
4) Give multiple reference points.  Many times the log or stump you <br/>
reference is gone in a year, thus no one knows how to find the box.  <br/>
Suggest you list multiple landmarks so a person can move on if one <br/>
is missing.<br/>
<br/>
5) Give distances.  Often found myself second guessing if I had past <br/>
up box since had no idea how far the hike was to be.  <br/>
<br/>
6) Not an issue for me, but is for some.  Give easy of hike.  If it <br/>
is a 5 mile hike going uphill 4,000 feet, let people know this.  I <br/>
like the challenge, but some may not. Before they drive all the way <br/>
to your starting place then find out the hike is not for them, would <br/>
have been better if you just noted the difficulty in your clues (or <br/>
distance at least - #5).<br/>
<br/>
I guess that covers the main issues.  Like I said, some of you may <br/>
not agree with this, but felt I had to share.  I don't mind your <br/>
clues that make you think, but at least give some of the information <br/>
needed.  If nothing else a starting place.   <br/>

I agree with most of your issues ,but I also think that is most of the<br/>
fun of LETTERBOXING  is the research !<br/>
Discovering places ,and parks where you have never been to B/4.<br/>
<br/>
I research all my new letterbox clues B/4 I go to that town.<br/>
<br/>
I obtain detailed MAPS of the town ,or area I am going to . (B/4 I GO ) <br/>
<br/>
Mystery boxes I try to solve the clues B/4 I even leave my house. (try<br/>
to anyway).<br/>
<br/>
It does get a bit crazy when you are in a strange town and are trying to<br/>
do many boxes .Sometimes it takes more than one visit to that town to<br/>
find them all.<br/>
<br/>
People should try to use permanent landmarks as reference points.That is<br/>
sometimes a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Try  driving ,reading your maps, and clues in a strange town<br/>
......solo... he he  <br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents ..<br/>
Have fun (it's only a game) and don't give up.<br/>

I think it is polite to start your directions from an Interstate / <br/>
limited access highway exit.  If one is not around then the <br/>
intersection of a numbered US highway and a numbered state highway.<br/>
<br/>
I just did a series of boxes that required a 400 foot (+/-) climb up <br/>
a mountain.  Tiring for me, but too much for some people.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the webmasters could add to their excellent new site some <br/>
standard field boxes for length or climb.  They could be set up as <br/>
keys to limit a search.  Just an idea.<br/>

I agree!  Including what vetaran letterboxers should do when introducing<br/>
someone to the sport/hobbie, if possible give them the clues to a Letterbox<br/>
that gave you a rewarding search and make sure the letterbox is still there<br/>
before sending them.  I made a mistake of sending someone on one I had not<br/>
tried and has not yet produced a box.   They are still trying as we speak<br/>
but at this point I am not sure he would go for another.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering has anyone thought about rating the boxes 1-10, with 10<br/>
meeting a certain criteria ?<br/>
 or class boxes as hard, medium, or easy!   I am fairly new to this and may<br/>
be the 1000th person who has asked that very question.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing, I find the ones with the riddles and rhymes a lot of fun<br/>
but not ones that need a masters degree to solve.   Example a pond way up<br/>
high , we all know it is water of some sort but we do not know exactly what<br/>
we will find.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents! <br/>

Even better, try it with rather talkative 4-1/2 yo and 19 mo in the <br/>
background (or on your back for that matter)!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I just chalk it up to an inability to 'focus'.  As for boxes we've <br/>
attempted without success, we'd be well on our way to about 600 <br/>
found these days had we found them all instead of hovering at our <br/>
current plateau of 436 found...  Just another interesting and <br/>
sometimes frustrating part of letterboxing...<br/>

 Hah!  Let me get this straight.  You are having an issue because you found 2 <br/>
out of every 3 you looked for?  Wow.  ::grin::  You must get easily <br/>
frustrated.  Seems like a pretty good success rate to me.  I'm lucky if I get 1 out of <br/>
2.   But, to your point . . .<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, I am like you, I like to lay out my clues very well.  I like <br/>
the directions to be clear.  There is no excuse for poor directions.<br/>
<br/>
However, I do feel that the letterbox hunt begins as soon as you see the <br/>
clue.  You have to decipher it and look at street maps and anything else at your <br/>
disposal, not just the clues in your hand, to find the box.  I think its not <br/>
necessarily the job of the letterbox planter to put you at the trailhead, in <br/>
fact that is part of the challenge.<br/>
<br/>
How's this for being flip-floppy?  If a letterbox planter deliberately leaves <br/>
out distance info, trail difficulty info or something else, then that is <br/>
okay.  But if they didn't do it because they just FORGOT or didn't think it was <br/>
important, well, then that's not good and they should be more careful with their <br/>
clues.  ::grin::<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>

challenge for someone else.  I agree, it can be disheartening to <br/>
arrive at a location and not find a box - or to have difficulty in <br/>
finding the location at all.<br/>
<br/>
But then, there are boxes like "The Bard's Tale" in Colorado, which <br/>
the planter assumes will take years to decipher.  Years!  <br/>
<br/>
There are no rules to letterboxing.  No set standards for what makes <br/>
a good clue, and what is not.  Some clues list all the roads, every <br/>
pace, and every fallen log.  Others simply list something odd like a <br/>
gravestone marker and nearby landmark - and that's it.  Brilliant!  <br/>
<br/>
Bottom line - do your homework before you box.  I learned that lesson <br/>
the hard way in AZ when I took on a hike that was out of my ability <br/>
range.  Homework involves more than clues and directions, it involves <br/>
terrain, weather, and sometimes decoding, or reading in Polish.<br/>
<br/>
That - is the beauty of letterboxing.<br/>

The hunt starts at viewing the clue.  Not everyone wants to hold your hand<br/>
or put out a neon sign that says, "it's right here!"<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes obscure start points are on purpose and you simply have to exhaust<br/>
the possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
There are no guarantees that you find the box.  I was told early on, some<br/>
boxes are never found.<br/>

&gt; There are no rules to letterboxing.  No set standards for what makes<br/>
&gt; a good clue, and what is not.  Some clues list all the roads, every<br/>
&gt; pace, and every fallen log.  Others simply list something odd like a<br/>
&gt; gravestone marker and nearby landmark - and that's it.  Brilliant!<br/>

&gt;  Sent from the Internet <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not that anyone cares, but thought I would sum up some of my <br/>
&gt; frustration from our recent letterboxing tour through the mid-west.  <br/>
&gt; Some may not agree with my thoughts, and that is fine (I will try to <br/>
&gt; avoid your boxes in the future since they probably will not be found <br/>
&gt; anyway).   Here it goes:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Write your clues as if you are not from the area.  When an out of <br/>
&gt; state boxer is looking for a street in a large town, with no other <br/>
&gt; reference point, it wastes a lot of time.  Also turns off new boxers <br/>
&gt; if they can't even find where to start from.   Suggest you give <br/>
&gt; directions on how to get to starting place for hike.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) Give a starting place.  Clues are worthless if you don't even <br/>
&gt; know where the person started from.  "The Parking Lot" may be good <br/>
&gt; enough, unless it is bigger than a football field, or if you give a <br/>
&gt; clue like in #3.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) Give more specific directions.  "From the parking lot, go <br/>
&gt; Southwest to the cliff, and look under a rock" is a huge area to <br/>
&gt; cover.  Spent an hour on one of these, and never did find the box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4) Give multiple reference points.  Many times the log or stump you <br/>
&gt; reference is gone in a year, thus no one knows how to find the box.  <br/>
&gt; Suggest you list multiple landmarks so a person can move on if one <br/>
&gt; is missing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5) Give distances.  Often found myself second guessing if I had past <br/>
&gt; up box since had no idea how far the hike was to be.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 6) Not an issue for me, but is for some.  Give easy of hike.  If it <br/>
&gt; is a 5 mile hike going uphill 4,000 feet, let people know this.  I <br/>
&gt; like the challenge, but some may not. Before they drive all the way <br/>
&gt; to your starting place then find out the hike is not for them, would <br/>
&gt; have been better if you just noted the difficulty in your clues (or <br/>
&gt; distance at least - #5).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess that covers the main issues.  Like I said, some of you may <br/>
&gt; not agree with this, but felt I had to share.  I don't mind your <br/>
&gt; clues that make you think, but at least give some of the information <br/>
&gt; needed.  If nothing else a starting place.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Trip total:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 40+ found<br/>
&gt; 20+ missing or unfindable  (Lincoln, Nebraska 3 for 15, yuk)<br/>

<br/>
1) There's a difference between a walk and a hike. A walk is nice, <br/>
flat, leisurely. A hike may actually require one to break a sweat.  <br/>
<br/>
2) I agree that there needs to be a bit of a criteria for how people <br/>
grade their hikes. Easy for one is not easy for all. Hard for one may <br/>
be a snap for others too.<br/>
<br/>
3) Read the clues and do some research before you go somewhere you <br/>
have not been.  With the friends and acquaintances that we've made in <br/>
less than a year of boxing, if I were going to a spot that I did not <br/>
know, you BET i would send a quick email to a few people to ask what <br/>
I'm in for....<br/>
<br/>
4) Not all placers of letterboxes mean to put boxes out so that you <br/>
find them.   Some folks will make a huge pile of rocks alongside the <br/>
trail so it's obvious you know something's out of whack.  Some of us <br/>
make it a little tougher.. and a few folks hide them and make vague <br/>
clues so that it takes a real pro to find them. Its allll part of <br/>
learning who writes in what style and degree of difficulty. I've <br/>
found clues that others understand and I've thought were...umm...bad <br/>
(yeah, family list here... lol). We can;t stand doing mystery boxes <br/>
and usually pound our fists in frustration, then needing someone to <br/>
hold our hand to get there.... just the way each person thinks <br/>
provides variety in the difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
5) Again, are your hiking or boxing? We go hiking and hope to find <br/>
boxes. Other go boxing and might hike because they have to in order <br/>
to get the 22 boxes they want that day, etc.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just have to chime in again on this topic.  While I understand that <br/>
all possible research should be done in advance, I agree that **in my <br/>
personal experience**, Midwest letterboxes can be quite frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
1)  Many boxes seem to be orphaned... either planted by people who live <br/>
in other places or by people who are no longer active letterboxers.  We <br/>
have attempted to contact several planters for info and/or <br/>
clarification but have had our messages returned or not received <br/>
responses from them.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Boxes are relatively few and far between, requiring a substantial <br/>
effort just to get in the vicinity.  The closest boxes to us (that we <br/>
have not planted) are at least a 2-hour drive away.  Although we do <br/>
enjoy the outing on its own merits, it is rather disappointing to <br/>
discover that a box is missing and/or unfindable after dedicating quite <br/>
a bit of time and energy to it.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Often "vague clues" appear to be perfectly concrete until one gets <br/>
to the actual site and discovers that there are, say, 30 bushes to look <br/>
under instead of one as you would think from the clues.<br/>
<br/>
4)  Traffic to these boxes is relatively low, so posting questions to <br/>
the list prior to hunting may or may not yield helpful information.<br/>
<br/>
As new letterboxers, we realize we have a lot to learn.  Unfortunately, <br/>
we don't seem to have much of an opportunity without a vacation to <br/>
Connecticut.  :(<br/>

others also and now stick to mapquest. Mapquest also gives you the <br/>
choice of viewing aerial photos of many destinations which is <br/>
sometimes helpful for getting a better mental picture. <br/>
<br/>
The nice thing about the Microsoft streets and trips, which came with <br/>
our computer package, is that you can choose to plot routes yourself. <br/>
This allows you to map a route with several stops.<br/>
<br/>
You can sort of do this on mapquest, but I find it difficult.<br/>
<br/>
So, for locating a single spot or a route from A to B, I find <br/>
mapquest easiest. When I want more control or want to go from A to B <br/>
to C to D... I like the Microsoft tool.<br/>

The problem is when the clues are given in such a way that only a<br/>
person who knows the area can even begin to figure out where to<br/>
look on a map (e.g. a small park not found on internet searches).  See<br/>
the Gunslinger Letterbox clues in Texas if you want an example.  I <br/>
guess I can't understand why you would hide a box that nobody will <br/>
ever visit.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mapquest is pretty good for finding locations with a street address.<br/>
<br/>
I also use Terraserver (http://terraserver.microsoft.com/).  Terraserver will display topographic maps and aerial photos which is more helpful in dealing with locations that aren't on a street.<br/>
<br/>
Terraserver has several ways to look up maps including street address and latitude/longitude coordinates.<br/>
<br/>
US Geological Survey has an excellent tool (http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnis/web_query.gnis_web_query_form) for looking up lat/lon coords by feature name.  For example, if you were trying to find the lat/lon for Half Dome in Yosemite, you could type Half Dome and select California from the drop down and would get the coordinates: 37d 44' 46" N 119d 31' 55" W.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the lat/lon input is in decimal degrees so you will have to have a converter which can be found at the JeEep website (http://www.jeeep.com/details/coord/).  Putting in Half Dome's standard coords gives me 37.74611, -119-531944.  Putting these into Terraserver will give me both a topo map of the area and an aerial photo of Half Dome.<br/>

  &gt; How do you research where a box is located.  Can you find detailed <br/>

  &gt; smaller, rural towns can be more difficult.  I have used yahoo.maps <br/>
