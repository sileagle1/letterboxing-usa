<br/>
Please treat yourself to a day of fun, exchanges, hunting, (and some <br/>
cheese racing) on October 4th in SLO, CA.<br/>
<br/>
http://webpages.charter.net/astroweaver/letterboxing/meadow.html<br/>
<br/>
We will have easy to reach boxes and some difficult ones available in <br/>
the area.<br/>
<br/>
All of the stamps at the gathering will be stroller friendly. No long <br/>
hikes, no climbing. I am suffering with a knee problem so I am <br/>
acutely aware of the problems with climbs.<br/>
<br/>
None of my Middle Earth Series, with the one exception of Return of <br/>
the King, require any climbing. None of JugglerMouse's Redwall Series <br/>
require it, either. <br/>
<br/>
With easy walks in the immediate area we have also:<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Chong's Candy<br/>
Alaska in SLO (2 stamps)<br/>
Pandy's Native American Bear<br/>
Palme d'Or<br/>
Bookstore Box<br/>
Walking Tour<br/>
Night and Day Mouse<br/>
<br/>
There will be a stamp at Stamp Luis Obispo, a special event stamp at <br/>
the gathering, several touring event stamps (including Legerdemaine's <br/>
K-Martha), four presidential stamps sent by Just Beth in Connecticut, <br/>
a new series of stamps based on the Mexican game Loteria, and cheese <br/>
racing stamps (pro and anti). There will most likely be at least 40 <br/>
folk or more for you to exchange with and a grunch of hitchhikers to <br/>
take back away.<br/>
<br/>
Harder climbs and searches could include:<br/>
<br/>
Ryan Carpenter's Camelot series (5), Finding Bessie, Black Hill (2 <br/>
stamps), Madonna Mountain (name escapes me); Amanda from Seattle's <br/>
Night and Day, Night Train. There are more out at Montana del Oro <br/>
park - much more strenuous hiking. Gull in the Sky by Don and Gwen is <br/>
well worth getting. <br/>
<br/>
Bring your compasses. We are going to have to be crafty in hiding the <br/>
stamps in the park. <br/>
<br/>
We suggest you bring something for a noonish potluck. We will supply <br/>
hotdogs and charcoal. Okay, we might have some Kraft singles there <br/>
for racing, too.<br/>
<br/>
Do let us know how many of you are planning on coming to this. <br/>
<br/>
Carving as fast as I can,<br/>
Sir Balthazar<br/>
