<br/>
As far as the eastern side of the state goes, I think we are down to one set<br/>
of abandoned boxes which Delirium and I are in the process of trying to<br/>
contact the previous owner. Those are the Oakland county Independence Oaks<br/>
boxes that were placed by Edugaytor, specifically these:<br/>
<br/>
49 Habitat Trail  1 Clarkston, MI  Oakland<br/>
Dragonflies Are Free  1 Clarkston, MI  Oakland<br/>
Independent Oak  1 Clarkston, MI  Oakland<br/>
Ladies of the Lake  1 Clarkston, MI  Oakland<br/>
This Place Rocks  1 Clarkston, MI  Oakland<br/>
<br/>
So far, the placer's email has bounced and the only other potential lead is<br/>
possibly an addressed post card he originally placed in his boxes. Delirium<br/>
has kindly offered to check on several of these boxes this weekend to see if<br/>
we can get a snail mail address with which we contact the owner and<br/>
determine his intentions. I will send an update as more information becomes<br/>
available on this set of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I am willing to be listed as the caretaker for all 5, pending contact of the<br/>
original placer. If you would like to list me as such now, pending formal<br/>
contact of the owner, feel free to do so. I remember he was moving back last<br/>
year, so I don't hold out much hope of having success with his previous<br/>
address, but plan to try every way possible.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the other two go, I think we have a consensus that the following<br/>
two boxes need to be removed from the website as they are confirmed missing<br/>
in action.<br/>
<br/>
Secret Garden  1 Royal Oak, MI  Oakland<br/>
Snowflake  1 Brighton, MI  Livingston<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your efforts,<br/>
<br/>
