<br/>
Just got back from a 5 day stay on Lake Champlain. I went up there with<br/>
Jerry &amp; Rae (Letterbox on the Knob, Cape Cod).<br/>
During our stay we visited 9 sites.<br/>
Valcour Island.....both boxes are alive and well. We were the first to stamp<br/>
in at Arnolds Gambit and the second at Sloop Bay.<br/>
Crown Point is well, as are Fort Carillon (Ticonderoga) and Fort William<br/>
Henry [which gets my vote for the most outrageous location for a letterbox].<br/>
The two on Long Trail and Prayer Rock have new stampers too.<br/>
We tried to get to Butler Island, but gave up after swamping our kayaks<br/>
twice (white caps and all that).<br/>
The box at the Whales Tails may be located in an area that has not been<br/>
cleared in at least a year [assuming the 5 blue spouts are associated with<br/>
aerobic exercising], and we could not find it.<br/>
We also placed "companion boxes", one in the US and one in Canada. Rae is<br/>
writing a story, similar to the Knob Letterbox which will be appearing<br/>
shortly. Does anyone know if this is the first Canadian letterbox.<br/>
We had a great time, and now that there are two new boxes up there, we will<br/>
have to return.<br/>

It is not, so I was told a couple of years ago from a source<br/>
I consider reliable, but I have no further evidence other than <br/>
correspondence to back that claim up.<br/>

This sounds like a great LB trip! Glad to hear reports on all these <br/>
northern boxes. I do believe you are the first to place a box in <br/>
Canada. Way to go!<br/>
