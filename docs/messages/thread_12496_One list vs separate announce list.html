Why does everyone think I'm buried?<br/>
Hrm.<br/>
<br/>
To me, it makes sense to have a separate announce list.  <br/>
I see two scenarios: <br/>
 - You get the emails.<br/>
 - You read the list on the webpage.<br/>
<br/>
If you get the emails, then two lists are totally transparent to you. You get<br/>
the email, filter it where you want, and go on.<br/>
<br/>
If you read the list on the webpage, then I can see where two lists would be a<br/>
hassle.  However, there's always the What's New page to check up on.  Maybe an<br/>
addition allowing you to specify how many boxes you want to see, or new boxes<br/>
from a given state would alleviate the 'but what if more than 25 show up before<br/>
I see the one I wanted to see?' question.<br/>
<br/>
In my view, two lists allows you to get one or the other.  For instance, maybe<br/>
you only want new box announcements.  Right now, you have to wade through all<br/>
the jabber to get the new box announcements, and there's no guarantee that the<br/>
person will even put the state in the title, so who knows if you'll even see it?<br/>
<br/>
That's just this nerd's opinion.<br/>

I've gotta admit that I like the new announce group very much. <br/>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lbox-announce). It formats beautifully <br/>
and it's so relentlessly automatic. I've been clicking that little <br/>
box at the bottom of all my "add a box" adventures.<br/>
<br/>
Randy's idea of having the announce list post here to letterbox-usa <br/>
was intriguing. Do people think that would be a hassle?<br/>

stuff and receive only new box announcements to my e-mail <br/>

just search the announce list for your state's (or state of interest) <br/>

as Everyone is informed that 2 lists exist, and what each one <br/>
