Thanks to all for your responses about NoCal letterboxing. Linda, I hope to<br/>
make a trip south to seek out your boxes!  %^)<br/>
<br/>
I'mn curious about how y'all learn about letterboxing. I read the<br/>
Smithsonian article. Are there other ways of finding out about it? Seems to<br/>
me the article fell on fertile ground....<br/>
<br/>
Also...I seem to remember from the venerable Smithsonian article that<br/>
Dartmoor l'boxers use the traditional orienteering symbols in their clues.<br/>
Any thoughts on this? I found an orienteering site with a wonderful catalog<br/>
of symbols (http://www.williams.edu:803/Biology/orienteering/o~index.html)<br/>
and I'd like to incorporate them into my clues.<br/>
What's the barometer on this?<br/>
<br/>
Thnx,<br/>

Hi Kate, it took me a couple of re-readings of the article before I<br/>
thought to look on the internet.  By that time Erik &amp; Dan had already<br/>
hooked up with the other Eric and put together the ILC web site.  As far<br/>
as I know, that was the internet beginnings.  My web search didn't even<br/>
find a Dartmoor site.  Now there are a couple of books &amp; who knows what<br/>
else!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Also...I seem to remember from the venerable Smithsonian article that<br/>
&gt;  Dartmoor l'boxers use the traditional orienteering symbols in their clues.  and I'd like to incorporate them into my clues.<br/>
&gt;  What's the barometer on this?<br/>
<br/>
go for it!  We have been pretty lax about what kind of clues we all<br/>
prefer &amp; orienteering clues sound great!!<br/>

Not to be a nit-picker, but, Dan and I  (mostly Dan) established the<br/>
Letterboxing USA site before Eric and ILC came on the scene. However,<br/>
ILC hosted the first talk list.<br/>

Welcome to the list.  Being an orienteer myself I would have no personal objection to the use of O' symbols, BUT I'm afraid it would make it rather difficult for non-orienteers.  And I think it best to try to make the hobby approacheable to as many as possible at this stage.  Might make more sense at a later date when there are more boxes and boxers out there.<br/>

John makes good points and I had this in mind when I made my first<br/>
box sort of easy.  However (and there always is a however :-)), I <br/>
would go for it anyway. :-)  A suggestion may be to include a link <br/>
from your clue to the Heather William's O site or the IOF web site <br/>
which explains the O symbols.  I think that would work very well. <br/>
Besides, I'm planning a photo-O with a letterbox hidden at one of <br/>
the controls once the revision of a local O map is made available <br/>
at the end of June, so people who want to hunt that box also will<br/>
have 2 reasons to learn them, not mentioning the fact that they may <br/>
have to learn them for Dartmoor, if I understand what you have said.<br/>
Besides, learning the O symbols may get them interested in O, which<br/>
is clearly a Good Thing (tm).  <br/>
<br/>
On the easy/hard thing, I have a little story.  I was recently<br/>
hunting a box that seemed very hard.  It took me 3 hours to find it <br/>
after a trail of only 2 or 3 miles.  In my opinion the clues were<br/>
ambiguous and many landmarks I saw could satisfy them.  Boy was <br/>
I shocked when I counted 37 [sic] entries in the logbook, including<br/>
9 yr old kids :-)  Persistence paid off.  I guess the point is you <br/>
never know, and John's point about getting the hobby started with<br/>
easy boxes is certainly valid, but if people want to find your box,<br/>
they will persist.<br/>
<br/>
John also wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Tell me more about the [Dartmoor clue] books!!!<br/>
<br/>
It is my understanding that you have to log 100 stamps before being<br/>
able to obtain one of these.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong.<br/>
