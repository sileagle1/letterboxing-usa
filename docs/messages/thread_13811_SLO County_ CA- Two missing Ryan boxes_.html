                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday I was by the "garden" mentioned in Ryan's Run For the <br/>
Border Series - the garden has been completely removed, and the box <br/>
must be gone.<br/>
<br/>
And on Sunday, Emily Rose, Sadie, and I walked the first loop of The <br/>
Montana de Oro Series.   The first box, School of Fish, is definitely <br/>
gone.  It appears that probably a further crumbling in the rock wall <br/>
where it was placed may have caused it to tumble out and then be <br/>
carried away.  We had the right spot because both Emily and Sadie had <br/>
been there before and found it.   The second box, The Dolphin, was in <br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
Though we completed the whole loop, we can not actually verify the <br/>
rest of the boxes- we realized at some point that we had not given <br/>
ourselves nearly enough daylight hours for the hike, and so though we <br/>
noted the places where the next boxes might be, we REALLY needed to <br/>
keep moving and get ourselves back to civilization.  I want to take <br/>
the walk again sometime giving myself more time to complete it.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh- two Ryan boxes found missing in a week.  And there he is off <br/>
tramping the country, not worrying about us at home and our troubles <br/>
at all...<br/>
