                    <div class="plaintext-content">yippe, myself and family are new to letterboxing. We tried to find<br/>
two, and no luck. We were undaunted however, despite the pouring rain<br/>
on our last endeavour. we did have fun, ater tons of berries and to my<br/>
little guys dismay found a wee dead mouse, he cried, wanted to pray<br/>
for him to come back to life like Jesus did for Lazarus. 'Out of the<br/>
mouth of babes'. Five minutes later he was happily hopping about<br/>
looking for frogs.<br/>
Anyways, we are hoping to get out again locally and find something.We<br/>
live near Burnaby BC Canada.<br/>
In the fall we will be driving down the I-5 past Pasedena into the<br/>
California desert. Just wondering if anyone knows of something that<br/>
may fit in with a marathon 32 hour drive enroute and for a family with<br/>
a 3 and 8 year old.  <br/>
We made a family stamp and my daughter did a cute stamp (chocolate<br/>
bunny)..<br/>
we hope to plant many boxes once we have found at least two and see<br/>
how it is done properly.<br/>
Wehave since learned to keep informed as to our boxes and let people<br/>
know if they are inactive, otherwise we wouldn't have been stuck<br/>
they were not LBNA boxes, no wonder huh??<br/>
