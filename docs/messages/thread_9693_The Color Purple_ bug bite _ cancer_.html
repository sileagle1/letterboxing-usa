                    <html><body>I lost an Uncle in the Korean war, my father--a career Marine--won the Silver Star medal in Vietnam and I have to say when I read the Purple Heart post, I didn't blink an eye. I thought it was nice of the person to take time to make the website and hand out awards.  But after reading the info on the Purple Heart site, I agree now that perhaps a "Purple Band-Aid" Award or something similar, is more fitting.  I do think the original act was borne of good intentions and rather sweet.  <br/>
<br/>
Whatever the award is called, please view the funky bug bite photo attachment and see if I qualify..this beauty was garnered after planting a box on the coast of North Carolina this past summer!  Ever seen anything swell like that?  After three doctor visits and a dermatologist who thought we should name it....it is but a fading pink scar.  WARNING...it's not too gross, but it ain't pretty either!<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
<br/>
And last but not least.. it's bothered me before and I bit my tongue...and it happened again today so I'm speaking my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Psychomommy...you start your post noting that we all have a right to our opinions...then proceed to shotgun blast another for theirs.  You also imply in your post today and others you've penned in the past, that your battle with cancer has given you a 'it's all wonderful and our time here is so short' outlook on life, (as I imagine it would) but the nature of some of your past posts and this recent one...has been diametrically opposed to what you preach.  If time is so short and it's 'what we do with situations that matter,' why waste energy lambasting others?    <br/>
<br/>
If you are truly "sick and tired of political correctness" you shouldn't mind the following...<br/>
<br/>
Please stop playing the cancer card every time you strongly disagree with someone else's posts.  (I know, I've been on the receiving end of one of your "I survived cancer therefor..." postings during the infamous 'Lizardbutt controversy.'  There is not one among us who's life cancer has not touched.  Cancer sucks...but being a cancer survivor doesn't make your opinions more or less valid.  (It only makes you blessed for having beaten it.)<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.<br/>
