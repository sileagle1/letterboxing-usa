We have been having some discussion about a couple of letterboxers <br/>
getting together in Moab and next thing we knew, it had blossomed <br/>
into a full-blown gathering with people coming from at least CO, UT, <br/>
ID, and MT.  We are gettting excited, and I thought it might be nice <br/>
to let others know about the gathering in case they want to make a <br/>
trek out to some of the most fun country in the, well, country.  We'd <br/>
love to have anyone join us, just let the organizers know who's <br/>
coming.  It should be a blast.  It looks as if it is shaping up to be <br/>
one of the largest gatherings yet in the Rocky Mountain area.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the info from Kat and Y-Nought:<br/>
<br/>
OK, here it is. With lot's of help from the kindly Y-nought, we have<br/>
got it organized!!!!!!<br/>

Box On The Rocks - 2005, Moab, Utah<br/>
<br/>
Date: Sunday, April 10, 2005<br/>
Location: Rotary Park, Downtown Moab<br/>
Time: 2:00 - till whenever, maybe early evening?<br/>
What: Exchanges, maybe a little box hunting, lot's of laughing and<br/>
chatting, and did I mention pie???<br/>
<br/>
Bring a picnic lunch and beverage and join us! I think everyone is<br/>
excited to finally meet each other and it is an awesome place to<br/>
visit! I will organize some desserts for everyone after their<br/>
lunches and we'll go from there!<br/>
<br/>
Rotary Park: Unfortunately, no dogs are allowed in this park. It is<br/>
a nice green oasis with lots of trees and grass to relax in. Lot's<br/>
of playground equipment and the kids can just run!!!<br/>

Yes! Y-nought is going to carve one of his wonderful stamps for the <br/>
gathering, and I am going to put an event box together to hide also!<br/>
<br/>
Cadenza - Thank you for posting the info. here for me! I ran out of <br/>

&gt; From Main St., head east to 400 East. Turn right when 400 East<br/>
&gt; deadends and drive until you see Dave's Corner Market. Turn east<br/>
&gt; here on Millcreek and drive a little ways up the road. You'll see<br/>
&gt; the park on your right. You can also follow the signs to the<br/>
&gt; Slickrock Bike Trail. It is farther up this road. There are<br/>
&gt; restrooms, picnic tables, bbq pits, and some water available.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are many boxes now in Moab, so plan to spend some time and do<br/>
&gt; some boxing while you are here! There is even a box series planted<br/>
&gt; in this park already!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you can join us, please post how many are in your group, so we<br/>
&gt; have a rough idea of how many people are coming. I'm excited, it<br/>
&gt; sounds like we have at least fifteen and hopefully more coming.<br/>

If anyone is interested in the Moab, Utah gathering, please join the <br/>
RMLetterboxing group. That is where the most up to date info will be. <br/>
And it would be nice to hear from you there if you are hoping to come.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, join RMLetterboxing even if you can't come. It's a pretty <br/>
fun little group. <br/>

Oh it sounds terrific! We would love to leave our cold digs in Maine<br/>
for some desert fun but this year just won't happen for us (our baby<br/>
is due in April/May!) We have spent a lot of time in that area and<br/>
rafting on the San Juan River and it has been a while since we've been<br/>
able to make it out there. My sister was a river guide in Utah for a<br/>
few summers too. Maybe we can make it to the 2006 edition! I miss all<br/>
of the red sand in every fold and crevice of my camping gear.<br/>
