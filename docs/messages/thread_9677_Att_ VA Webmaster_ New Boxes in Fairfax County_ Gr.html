and Elephant Walk Letterbox.<br/>
The Astronaut. America's first astronaut, this intrepid fellow's <br/>
1961 sub-orbital flight began the USA's space program. Those <br/>
who knew him remember him with affection and respect.<br/>
Follow the broad trail until it turns almost due East to head <br/>
downhill. Instead, keeping "X marks the spot" (look at the tree <br/>
ahead of you) to your right, follow the path that goes straight <br/>
ahead. When you come to a fork, bear right and from here walk <br/>
about 34 paces to the "Phil Dimi" beech tree on your right. From <br/>
Phil, walk another few paces to "Dick Brown", set back on the <br/>
right. Across the path from Dick is a group of 4 trees; stand in the <br/>
center of these and, on a bearing of 22 degrees walk 24 steps to <br/>
another tree with a blackened stub at its base. Standing by the <br/>
stub, on a bearing of 50 degrees walk 24 steps to another tulip <br/>
tree with a hollow at the base. The Astronaut dwells here under <br/>
leaves, sticks and a rock.<br/>
The New King. Since we all know the erstwhile king of the jungle <br/>
is actually a denizen of open woodlands and savannahs, we <br/>
propose this fellow for the post. A mild-mannered, <br/>
family-oriented vegetarian, his imposing stature and regal <br/>
bearing, not to mention his habitat, make him the perfect <br/>
candidate. Long live the New King! Follow the clues to the <br/>
Elephant Walk box. After stamping in and replacing it, continue <br/>
on up this trail. You will pass another trail coming in on the left <br/>
and soon after that you will come to a fork. Bear left. After another <br/>
12-14 minutes you will come to another fork just past the tree on <br/>
the right that's sticking its elbow out. Bear left here also and stay <br/>
on this main path until you can see a road, houses and <br/>
meadows ahead in the distance, about 3 minutes, where a <br/>
narrow path comes in on the left. Take this path and follow it as it <br/>
turns right downhill and then left along a fence line. Ahead you <br/>
will see a large beech on the left. Step around this tree to find the <br/>
encouraging statement carved into its NW side. The New King is <br/>
at the base of the tree below this carving, under leaves, sticks <br/>
and a rock.<br/>
To return to your car: Retrace your steps back up this path to <br/>
where it ends at the trail you followed from Elephant Walk. Turn <br/>
left and then immediately right. At the next "T" you may go left <br/>
down to the road and then right to walk to your car. Or, if you want <br/>
to stay in the woods a bit longer, go to the 4th intersect and then <br/>
turn left, which takes you back to the start and also your car.<br/>
