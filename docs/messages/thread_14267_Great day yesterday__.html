                    <div class="plaintext-content">We started out going back to Loreilla Park, where we were able to <br/>
pick up the two stamps there. We walked poor little Zackypoo's legs <br/>
off, and I ended up toting him out after the last box was found. A <br/>
four year old gets awful heavy after a while, but it was well worth <br/>
the trip. <br/>
<br/>
We headed home to leave the little one with hubby, then the rest of <br/>
us headed back out to Lake Anna State park, where we picked up Mom's <br/>
favorite bird stamp and the Tombstone stamp. Awesome hike and we had <br/>
a surprise too. We found Mike the Bike HH in the Tombstone box. <br/>
Wonder where he will end up next! <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully we can go back and find the other box on the trail at a <br/>
later date. Not many boxes left in our area of Virginia left. <br/>
Hopefully we can plant a few and build up the knowledge of <br/>
letterboxing around the area. Was thinking of approaching our <br/>
extension agency about starting a 4-H group for letterboxing. Has <br/>
anyone else done this? Any tips or ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
