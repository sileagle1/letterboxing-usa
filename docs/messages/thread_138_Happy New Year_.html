<br/>
A bit long note here.  Read if you have time:<br/>
<br/>
Something tells me this group will have no trouble finding things to<br/>
yak about.  Here's something to yak about that perhaps will not bore<br/>
you: I had a dream a few days ago which may relate to letterboxing,<br/>
secrets, hiding, etc.<br/>
<br/>
First a little background:<br/>
I recently divorced after a short marriage to someone I did not take<br/>
the time to get to know.  As a result of the separation I was forced<br/>
to live outside my own house (the house I had owned prior to getting<br/>
married) while my wife and her boyfriend lived it up at my expense.<br/>
They had charged $10,000.00 on my Visa card and drained my bank<br/>
account before I was able to figure out what was happening.  Even <br/>
still, she managed (through the courts) to keep me out of my house<br/>
for 21 more months.  But 3 weeks ago she was finally evicted from the<br/>
house.  Oh, happy day!  But unfortunately, almost everything I had<br/>
owned prior to meeting her turned up missing.  I have nobody to turn<br/>
to now but a reluctant insurance adjuster.  In addition my house was<br/>
trashed to the tune of $7,500.00.  So there's nothing I can do now but<br/>
start over.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, this is an ENTIRELY true story.  If you want I will accomodate<br/>
you with hard evidence (court records).<br/>
<br/>
Now here's the dream I had a few days ago:<br/>
My wife and her friends were showing up by my house and were causing trouble<br/>
there.  The house looked like somebody had been tampering with<br/>
it.  It made me feel as though what little I had left there was probably<br/>
being taken.  So I asked her, "Where did you get a key to my house?  You're<br/>
not supposed to be here anymore.  You're trespassing."  I knew I had changed<br/>
the locks since she left.  But she would not answer me.  She just stood there<br/>
staring defiantly as if to say, "You figure it out."  Later on in the dream<br/>
I let myself into the house with my key and I found an old friend hiding in<br/>
the closet.  He said that he and his other friends had cleaned the entire<br/>
house from top to bottom and were watching over the place for me.  I felt<br/>
happy &amp; relieved then because my friends had been watching out for me and<br/>
helping me while I was away.  You can't imagine what a good feeling that was.<br/>
While I had thought I was in for more heartache instead I found out that I<br/>
had friends preparing the place and watching over it.<br/>
<br/>
How does this dream relate to letterboxing?  Well, that's a point for<br/>
discusssion.  Here's what I think:  The dream has hiding involved, it has<br/>
division involved and it also has some false impressions.<br/>
But most importantly it reveals that something good was happening, not<br/>
something bad as was originally perceived.  I had come to believe that<br/>
certain bad things were continuing to happen at my house (in my dream),<br/>
but instead my friends had been there taking care of things.<br/>
No enemy had encroached again as I had suspected.  In letterboxing too<br/>
I have gained friends and some of you have come through for me at crucial<br/>
moments when I felt like giving up.  Sometimes its been just a short note<br/>
like, "Go Dan'l." or "Hang in there."<br/>
<br/>
But compare the dream in general to some of our recent letterboxing<br/>
foibles:  In the dream was this division with my wife who was taking<br/>
things.  Do you remember last summer when we had the division with ILC?<br/>
Many people felt that our art and our openness and ultimately our fun were<br/>
on the verge of being taken away by rampant commercialism.  That was very<br/>
real then.<br/>
<br/>
And more recently we have been accused (though I presume it was mainly me being<br/>
accused) of mounting up some sort of commercial effort or assualt on British<br/>
letterboxing.  But this flies in the face of any true intentions.  To my<br/>
knowledge to date not one person has expressed any overt interest in Dartmoor<br/>
save the kind that seek out more friends, more openness, more inclusivity, etc.<br/>
Certainly none of us has done any harm to Dartmoor people or to letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
So this is my interpretation of the dream as concerns letterboxing:  I believe<br/>
the old friend hiding in the closet represents the original spirit we had last<br/>
March (and still have) -- the fun, comradery and openness on which we based this<br/>
simple, cooperative effort which has already narrowly survived the commercial<br/>
onslaughts of ILC.  And I believe my ex-wife coming around to take what little<br/>
was left represents this recent accusation - the fear and paranoia that's been<br/>
generated by some of Adrian's (i hope former) friends.  His friends had thought<br/>
that we would ruin letterboxing (which they say lies in its secrecy.)  But if<br/>
we believe this accusation it is likely to have a debilitating effect on us.<br/>
So let's not.  I believe another role of the friend in my dream was to instruct<br/>
on why not to listen to false accusations.  You all have helped me to<br/>
develop the hobby here in the U.S., and you all have remained sincere and honest<br/>
in your efforts.  So you have been cleaning up and watching over things at times<br/>
when I was prone to listen to accusations and become overly emotional in <br/>
my reactions to them.  That's what friends do.  They watch over things while<br/>
you are away or when you don't know how to deal with a certain problem. They<br/>
say things like, "Relax. Have a cup of tea.  We'll take care of it for you."<br/>
<br/>
A general conclusion:<br/>
Remember your "old friends" (the fun and innocence and<br/>
openness).  That is what has made the effort what it is.  Its valuable indeed,<br/>
this openness and fun.  So let's jealously guard that.<br/>
Its the thing that's been hidden (until now) but its now being revealed (just<br/>
like my friend in my dream who was hiding in the closet.)  That's the true<br/>
secret of letterboxing that will be revealed to anyone who cares to hear about<br/>
it -- this friend we didn't know we had who's been hiding and preparing things<br/>
for us -- this simple fun.  That's why the Kids Corner is such an important<br/>
advance for us.  Even if we don't have kids in our lives we can rediscover<br/>
our knack to have fun like child would.  So I believe this will<br/>
clear up the confusion and misunderstandings that have hung<br/>
over us like a pall since last April when ILC first came on the scene.<br/>
<br/>
And anyone who cares to listen to this can take part<br/>
in the fun.  All they have to do is keep on enjoying and having fun, and if<br/>
they come to this list to just do it with a healthy outlook.  Don't whine &amp;<br/>
don't accuse.  We're in this for the fun and nothing more.  Nobody here is out<br/>
to make a buck on the good intentions of others (or their art).  Nobody here is<br/>
interested in violating the hobby of letterboxing in any way.  We just use maps<br/>
and the internet because there's no other way to do it with an area this large.<br/>
Internet does have a downside to it - that's true.<br/>
But a fringe benefit of the internet is that we get to have this wide array<br/>
of interesting people involved.  And eventually, just about anywhere you go in<br/>
the U.S. you will be able to have some letterboxing fun and be part of this<br/>
interesting combination of maps, hiding places and fun.<br/>
<br/>
So lets let this New Year be a new year in letterboxing in which we will<br/>
preserve the spirit and comradery we started out with (and that we'll jealously<br/>
guard it throughout the coming year.)  I'm sure that since this is a totally<br/>
open and unregulated list our only defense against attacks in the future will<br/>
be to stick together and remain friends at whatever level the internet will<br/>
afford.  I say that many of you are friends.  I do hope to meet some of you in<br/>
the coming year and I wish you all well until such time that we can do more<br/>
together, whether via internet or in person.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ps.  Sorry about your box being vandalized Randy.<br/>
You know, there will always be a bit of<br/>
contradiction (and tension) between the yearning to be open and the (very<br/>
real) need to be secretive and/or hidden.  I've learned this the hard way<br/>
in life.<br/>
But a good letterbox, I think, will be easy enough to invite some fun and not<br/>
be so secretive/hidden as to prevent discovery.  The secret, I think,<br/>
is to somehow not invite the wrong people to look for or stumble accross<br/>
our boxes.  Perhaps this can be accomplished if in the fronts of our minds<br/>
(as we are looking for hiding places) we consider the kinds of people we would<br/>
like to discover our letterboxes as well as the kinds we would like NOT to<br/>
discover them.<br/>
Adrian's old friends and the people who stole or vandalized Deborah's and<br/>
Randy's boxes are the wrong people.  I'm sure there's some way to dissociate<br/>
from them besides the obvious ways -- perhaps in the way we hide boxes, make<br/>
up clues, etc.  Let's discover those ways together.  It can be fun. <br/>
Also, i agree with Adrian that Compass bearings can add fun to the hunt<br/>
(if that's what you said Adrian).  I think you will be much less apt then to<br/>
feel as though you've been led on a "Wild Goose Chase".<br/>

<br/>
Victor, are you from Ohio?  If so, you would be the first of whom I'm aware. <br/>
Welcome to the discussion.  You have already retransmitted if you mean the same<br/>
thing as posting to the list.  Your response above went out to the group.  If<br/>
you want to send a separate message to the group you can do so at this web page<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/<br/>
Go there and click on the mailbox in the upper left corner of the page.<br/>
<br/>
"ILC" stands for International Letterboxing Club, a commercial letterboxing<br/>
venture.  The addrees for it is http://www.letterboxing.com<br/>
We splintered around August because it was a commercial enterpsise whose main<br/>
vision appeared to be making money and establishing exclusive rights to<br/>
letterbox clues.  It also had a tendency to not incorporate the ideas of its<br/>
members into its vision. <br/>
<br/>
I was thrown out of ILC because of my staunch disagreement with its proprietor,<br/>
Eric Mings.  Actually, I felt I went overboard at the time<br/>
in my comments to him and I attempted to make a public apology.  But Mings<br/>
elected (for unknown reasons) to keep back my apology from the rest of the<br/>
group.  In short (and in the end), I just respectfully disagreed with his<br/>
vision.  At bottom I felt his aim was to make a profit on people's artwork and<br/>
to charge other people money to get<br/>
clues.<br/>
<br/>
My vision has been to have fun and to incorporate maps, letterboxing and the<br/>
internet.  From the beginning I have tried to include everyone's ideas as far as<br/>
possible in determining how the site and the talk list should be conducted. <br/>
That's it in a nutshell for you. We've enjoyed a lot of success so far and only<br/>
a couple of instances of vandalism or stolen boxes.  I'm sure everyone is<br/>
looking forward to hearing from you, esp. if you decide to create your own<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, if you want to reply here it will go out to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Again, welcome aboard.  I will appreciate any input you have as to how we should<br/>
conduct the site and/or the talk-list.  And if you make a letterbox let me<br/>
know.  I will post your clues here for free.<br/>
<br/>
Dan'l <br/>
<br/>
Ps.  www.letterboxing .org has a wealth of letterboxing information for you and<br/>
feel free to ask questions here at will.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Something tells me this group will have no trouble finding things to<br/>

&gt;BTW, this is an ENTIRELY true story.  If you want I will accomodate<br/>
&gt;you with hard evidence (court records).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now here's the dream I had a few days ago:<br/>
&gt;My wife and her friends were showing up by my house and were causing<br/>
trouble<br/>
&gt;there.  The house looked like somebody had been tampering with<br/>
&gt;it.  It made me feel as though what little I had left there was probably<br/>
&gt;being taken.  So I asked her, "Where did you get a key to my house?  You're<br/>
&gt;not supposed to be here anymore.  You're trespassing."  I knew I had<br/>
changed<br/>
&gt;the locks since she left.  But she would not answer me.  She just stood<br/>

&gt;staring defiantly as if to say, "You figure it out."  Later on in the dream<br/>
&gt;I let myself into the house with my key and I found an old friend hiding in<br/>

&gt;Many people felt that our art and our openness and ultimately our fun were<br/>

&gt;of interesting people involved.  And eventually, just about anywhere you go<br/>
in<br/>
&gt;the U.S. you will be able to have some letterboxing fun and be part of this<br/>
&gt;interesting combination of maps, hiding places and fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So lets let this New Year be a new year in letterboxing in which we will<br/>
&gt;preserve the spirit and comradery we started out with (and that we'll<br/>
jealously<br/>
&gt;guard it throughout the coming year.)  I'm sure that since this is a<br/>
totally<br/>
&gt;open and unregulated list our only defense against attacks in the future<br/>
will<br/>
&gt;be to stick together and remain friends at whatever level the internet will<br/>
&gt;afford.  I say that many of you are friends.  I do hope to meet some of you<br/>
in<br/>
&gt;the coming year and I wish you all well until such time that we can do more<br/>
&gt;together, whether via internet or in person.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dan'l<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ps.  Sorry about your box being vandalized Randy.<br/>
&gt;You know, there will always be a bit of<br/>
&gt;contradiction (and tension) between the yearning to be open and the (very<br/>
&gt;real) need to be secretive and/or hidden.  I've learned this the hard way<br/>
&gt;in life.<br/>
&gt;But a good letterbox, I think, will be easy enough to invite some fun and<br/>
not<br/>
&gt;be so secretive/hidden as to prevent discovery.  The secret, I think,<br/>
&gt;is to somehow not invite the wrong people to look for or stumble accross<br/>
&gt;our boxes.  Perhaps this can be accomplished if in the fronts of our minds<br/>
&gt;(as we are looking for hiding places) we consider the kinds of people we<br/>
would<br/>
&gt;like to discover our letterboxes as well as the kinds we would like NOT to<br/>
&gt;discover them.<br/>
&gt;Adrian's old friends and the people who stole or vandalized Deborah's and<br/>
&gt;Randy's boxes are the wrong people.  I'm sure there's some way to<br/>
dissociate<br/>
&gt;from them besides the obvious ways -- perhaps in the way we hide boxes,<br/>
make<br/>
&gt;up clues, etc.  Let's discover those ways together.  It can be fun.<br/>
&gt;Also, i agree with Adrian that Compass bearings can add fun to the hunt<br/>
&gt;(if that's what you said Adrian).  I think you will be much less apt then<br/>
to<br/>
&gt;feel as though you've been led on a "Wild Goose Chase".<br/>

	Interesting post about your dream and all it means to you.  It would be<br/>
interesting to hear the psycharist's interpretation if he chose to add<br/>
something.....<br/>
<br/>
	I've always heard that the house in dreams is a metaphor for your mind,<br/>
or whole being.  Years ago, after surgery and under medication, I had a<br/>
dream where I walked through my own house - that is, the house that I<br/>
hope it to be if I ever complete it to my 'vision', and, there was a<br/>
violent rain/hailstorm beating against all the windows, at the intensity<br/>
of a firehose every way I looked, and I was rushing about looking for<br/>
leaks.....Well, there were no leaks, the house of my dreams,perhaps my<br/>
body and mind, perhaps my psyche, was able to withstand the storm and I<br/>
knew a healing was in process and the storm would pass.  Strange how<br/>
dreams can be at once disquieting and calming.<br/>
<br/>
	I echo your sentiments about the interesting, often very caring,<br/>
friends that Letterboxing has brought into my like these last 8 or so<br/>
months. To all of you, thanks for sharing and nurturing this hobby with<br/>
me, in all your individual ways. While there will be some time before<br/>
the weather allows me to get out more boxes, by spring hopefully several<br/>
will be ready to go.  And, just maybe, I'll follow Tom Cooch's inspored<br/>
lead into the world of Letterbooking - such a magnificent twist on the<br/>
hobby!<br/>
<br/>
So to all of you, best wished for a healthy, happy, and prosperus New<br/>
Year!<br/>

	I echo Dan'ls's sentiments - especially, welcome to the group if you<br/>
choose to become involved. You'll find a lot if interesting and helpfull<br/>
people in the group.<br/>
<br/>
	If you're interested in getting a few letterboxes, go to the "Getting<br/>
Started" page at 'letterboxing.org.' Feel free to ask any or all of us<br/>
questions if you have any.  There is also a lot to be found on carving a<br/>
rubber stamp if this is new for you.<br/>
<br/>
	I'd be curious how you happened to find your way to letterboxing?  Many<br/>
(most?) discovered the Smithsonian article and went hunting on the web,<br/>
but there have been other pathways. We are always listening to what<br/>
works - one objective, obviously, is to nurture growth in the hobby so<br/>
that the rest of us will have more boxes to look for. Let us know.<br/>
