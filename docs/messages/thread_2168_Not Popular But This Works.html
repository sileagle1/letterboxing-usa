It is a proven fact that your best chance of attracting new business is <br/>
through Direct E-mail.<br/>
<br/>
It's a numbers game.  The more people receiving your ad, the better your <br/>
chances of attracting a substantial interest in your product or services.<br/>
<br/>
The profits that E-mail advertising generate are amazing.  We are living proof.  <br/>
We are a direct E-mail internet advertising company and our clients pay us <br/>
thousands of dollars a week to E-mail advertise their products and services.   <br/>
We utilize a database of over 100 million internet addresses that are constantly <br/>
updated and checked for deliverability before we mail them.<br/>
<br/>
The secret to an effective bulk E-mail marketing campaign on the internet is <br/>
directly related to the freshness of the lists used.  To ensure that our customers <br/>
receive the freshest mailing addresses, we re constantly updating and revising <br/>
our mailing lists.  NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME we are making these lists available <br/>
for purchase.<br/>
<br/>
"MASTER MARKETERS CD VOL. 4" consists of 20 Million E-mail addresses <br/>
that were cleaned and verified to be 100% deliverable as of 4/2/2000.  <br/>
You can start mailing these addresses immediately.  You get 865 clean <br/>
and verified files of addresses.<br/>
<br/>
We have removed all the following domains.<br/>
<br/>
THESE DOMAINS ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT INCLUDED:<br/>
Compuserve.com<br/>
Genie.com<br/>

There are no International domains in this CD. All addresses are <br/>
pure .COM AND .NET.<br/>
<br/>
There are ABSOLUTELY NO DUPICATE ADDRESSES! <br/>
<br/>
Our CD does not contain any of the bogus and filled addresses used by <br/>
other companies to ad inflated numbers to their lists.  We pay full time <br/>
employees to perform hundreds of hours of list verification and deduplication <br/>
of our lists. REMEMBER, our business is mailing for individuals and companies.  <br/>
We mail over 15 million direct E-mails per week for our clients and the addresses <br/>
contained in the "Master Marketers CD" are the same fresh, clean lists we use.  <br/>
<br/>
We maintain a huge database of anti-commerce radicals who want the net for <br/>
themselves.  We run our lists against this database and remove all E-mail <br/>
addresses these radicals use to trap you into mailing to them so they can <br/>
cause you trouble.<br/>
<br/>
