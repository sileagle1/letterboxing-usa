                    <div class="plaintext-content">Zach, Shabree and I left early yesterday morning for another <br/>
letterboxing adventure. First we went to Goose Island to try to find <br/>
the Silver Eagle's Big Tree letterbox that we couldn't find before. <br/>
This time, after re-reading the clues and being better prepared, we <br/>
found it without any problem. It is alive and well. We even found a <br/>
hitchhiker there! ;) The kids once again read the statistics on the <br/>
Big Tree and explored around the other large oak trees on the <br/>
property. We didn't see any snakes this time, but Zach and Shabree <br/>
had fun watching the many ant lions in action. The first of the <br/>
showers that continued intermitently all day caught us there. <br/>
 Still on Goose Island, we drove to the old Lamar Cemetery, where we <br/>
explored and read the old tombstones, as well as took compass <br/>
readings and letterboxed. <br/>
 The town of Lamar was established in 1838, and a one acre parcel of <br/>
land was set aside for a cemetery. It was 16 years until the first <br/>
person was buried there. That person was Patrick O'Conner, who was a <br/>
direct descendent of Roderick O'Connor, the last king of Ireland. <br/>
Ironically, O'Connor was sent west for his health, but died only <br/>
hours after arriving in Lamar. Eventually, the town ceased to exist, <br/>
and the cemetery fell to disuse, and was completely lost in the <br/>
dense growth of brush. However, it has been restored since the <br/>
1960's and has a historical marker now. It is a very interesting <br/>
place, representing many more stories in the history of South Texas.<br/>
   I wanted to get some photos there, but another shower made us <br/>
abandon that idea, and so left Goose Island and drove on to the <br/>
Aransas Wildlife Refuge near Tivoli. We stopped in the Wildlife <br/>
Interpretative Center, where I bought a yearly pass, this time, and <br/>
we looked all around the museum exhibits, picked up some brochures, <br/>
and bought a few things in the gift shop. Zachary selected a <br/>
portfolio of endangered species cards, while Shabree got a really <br/>
cute poster of a baby bobcat. I got two postcards for my album. The <br/>
park ranger marked changes on the maps that they gave us. Two trails <br/>
are being closed down  the Butterfly Trail that I had hoped to see <br/>
that day and then the other half of the looped Hog Lake Trail that I <br/>
had mentioned in last week. It is the part of the trail where <br/>
Funhog's Whooping Crane letterbox is placed. :( <br/>
 Leaving the Center, we drove on towards the trails. First we parked <br/>
at the Bay Overlook, and followed that trail through the very large <br/>
canopy of a huge oak tree, and on to the dune `cliffs' over the bay. <br/>
The view was quite beautiful. Then we went back under the oak canopy <br/>
to read the information about the Civilian Conservation Corps work <br/>
in the Refuge during the late 1930's, and relax on the bench for <br/>
awhile. After that, we got back in the car and drove to the Jones <br/>
Lake viewing area, but walking out to the pier, were disappointed <br/>
not to see any alligators. We did see a loudly calling duck fly in, <br/>
though. <br/>
  Next we drove down the side road to the Dagger Point Trail, and <br/>
walked only a little way down the overgrown woodsy trail before <br/>
turning back and going back to the beginning point where we went the <br/>
other way to the wooden overlook. Again there was a beautiful <br/>
panoramic view of San Antonio Bay. <br/>
  Then we returned to our van and drove back to the main road and on <br/>
to the Big Tree Trail. Parking and crossing the road to the <br/>
trailhead, we started on the longest hike of the day, where we hoped <br/>
to find Silver Eagle's Aransas Whooper letterbox. It was really hot, <br/>
and that, combined with the intermittent showers all day, had <br/>
Zachary and Shabree ready to get back in the car and drive somewhere <br/>
to eat, before we had hiked very far. However, we persevered. I was <br/>
surprised at the amount of true moss the bright green fuzzy kind<br/>
that was growing so profusely on the north side of most of the trees <br/>
along the trail. There was still quite a bit of storm damage from <br/>
Hurricane Claudette on the trail. The trail was through thick woods, <br/>
and there were several large limbs broken over the path, that we had <br/>
to step over. The park service had many of them partially cut into <br/>
more manageable pieces and some cut wood stacked along the trail. We <br/>
still didn't find the `Aransas Whooper', but did see one place that <br/>
looked like it could be the one mentioned in the clues. However it <br/>
was completely blocked by the bushy top of a huge fallen tree, so we <br/>
couldn't check it out further. We returned to the van very hot and <br/>
sweaty, to leave the Refuge until the weather gets cooler, and the <br/>
broken limbs are cleared away.<br/>
  This time, since we were there in the late morning, over noon and <br/>
the early afternoon, we didn't see as many animals as we did last <br/>
week. We only saw 3 does, quite a few birds, and a lot of really <br/>
beautiful butterflies of various kinds.<br/>
 I received word that the nature trail in La Bahia State Park is <br/>
going to be open again, with damages repaired, by this weekend, so <br/>
unless the weather is bad, (Tropical Storm Grace), I'll probably <br/>
head there next Saturday. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I see you've been back to the refuge. The annual Duck Stamp issued at<br/>
the Post Office is also good for entry into any refuge in the US. They<br/>
only cost $15, are beautiful, and ALL the money goes to the NWR<br/>
system. Duck hunters have to have one but anyone can buy and use them.<br/>
Being a birder, I feel it's one of the best conservation deals around<br/>
and buy one every year. The ones found in letterboxes aren't the only<br/>
kind of stamps I collect!<br/>
<br/>
As for the Aransas Whooper Box, is the road that goes by the viewing<br/>
platform closed,too? If not, then you could access the box from there.<br/>
I'd hate to think that I'd left a poor, orphaned crane behind. Funhog<br/>
