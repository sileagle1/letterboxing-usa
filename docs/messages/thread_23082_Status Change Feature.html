                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have noticed that several boxes of mine have been<br/>
found/stamped by finders (when I personally<br/>
maintenanced my placements) with no change of status<br/>
noted on the LBNA clue sheet and no e mail feedback to<br/>
me personally. I have also noticed that on numerous<br/>
occasions I have received e mail feedback from finders<br/>
in addition to a status change, on the clue sheet, from<br/>
said finder.  I therefore do not think  that by having<br/>
one feature it  necessarily precludes the other.  In<br/>
some of the cases where I have only received a status<br/>
change I have occasionally looked up boxes placed by<br/>
the finder and sent a query to them about the physical<br/>
condition of MY box via the "contact the placer<br/>
function" for one of their boxes and in the majority<br/>
of cases I then received feedback from them.  For<br/>
those I did not receive feedback from I figure I would<br/>
not have received it even without the status function.<br/>
  Of course I voice a few opinions in there <br/>
and everyone has one.<br/>
