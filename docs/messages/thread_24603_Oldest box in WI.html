  Just wanted to mention that today is the 9th anniversary of the oldest <br/>
  box in Wisconsin! The original placer (a "Steve") planted it on <br/>
  September 26, 1998. He is no longer in the game, but "The Dragon" <br/>
  adopted the box several years ago (as he did with several other older <br/>
  boxes in Wisconsin).<br/>
<br/>
  The ORIGINAL logbook is still in the box, and 2 other logbooks have <br/>
  been added to the box over time. The original custome-made stamp is <br/>
  also in the box. Over the course of 9 years, 80 different <br/>
  individuals/groups have signed into the logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
  I know this isn't the absolute OLDEST box in the USA, but I think it is <br/>

  older than this one? <br/>

Thanks, I had forgotten about that listing!  I'm surprised to see that apparently there was a box planted in Alaska in 1998!  Anyone have any info on that??<br/>
It might be nice to update the list with more current status info.  Perhaps someone from each state could send info to Mark (is box still there?  is original stamp there?  original logbook?)<br/>
