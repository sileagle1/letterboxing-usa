of our beloved LbNA website last year, the accuracy of clues <br/>
is much improved. If you fail to find a letterbox it doesn't <br/>
always mean it's missing... Some boxes are very sneaky<br/>
that way. Those boxes that take multiple tries can be  that much<br/>
more rewarding when you do find them. You can always ask <br/>
about specific boxes on this Talk List to determine if anyone<br/>
has found them of late.<br/>
<br/>
As for size (and it does count) a logbook can be any size. <br/>
With the current interest in creating handmade books, any<br/>
size is possible. I have made and found logs as small as <br/>
2"X2". There are scrolls created from adding machine tape, <br/>
small bound books that roll up inside film containers, art <br/>
books that are 8"X6". It all depends on the size of the<br/>
container. Some signature stamps are too big for some <br/>
of the books I've seen but a portion can always be made to fit.<br/>
This is another aspect of letterboxing where the creativity of <br/>
hiders gets free reign. Let your imagination run wild...<br/>
