At last, the Dartmoor Exchange page is up and running on my website at:<br/>
http://www.catbeadmischief.com/dartmoorexchange.html<br/>
if for some reason the link doesn't work you can also get at it thru<br/>
my "Boxes Placed" link at http://www.catbeadmischief.com/<br/>

Catbead, I sent you a jpg of me, a jpg of my signature stamp, a jpg <br/>
of the Dartmoor exchange image stamp, the writeup for the stamp, and <br/>
I mailed the stamp to you today, December 11, 2003.  Remind Graham <br/>
that he'll need to include two marker pens with the stamp - one black <br/>
and one red.<br/>

YES!  My Dartmoor exchange stamp theme is Britain in America - John <br/>
Wesley.  He founded the Methodist Church in England, and thanks to <br/>
his itinerate ministry, brought it over to America.  Most every <br/>
Methodist Church in America is named by a location or person in <br/>
England!<br/>
<br/>
Isn't that the coolest thing!<br/>

*Most* of the Methodist Churches in America are named after Methodist <br/>
origins.<br/>
<br/>
There are, however, numerous exceptions.<br/>
<br/>
I was baptized and confirmed in the Epworth Methodist Church.<br/>
<br/>
I was married in the Wesley Methodist Church.<br/>

Now I attend the First United Methodist Church here in MA, and the <br/>
North Kingstown Methodist Church when I live in RI in the summer.<br/>
