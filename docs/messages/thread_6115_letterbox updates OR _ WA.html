and hiked back up there to leave my mark. I discovered that there is a brand new day use fee on all the <br/>
Columbia Gorge Parks in WA. This includes Beacon Rock, Horsetheif Lake and Maryhill, all home to <br/>
letterboxes. Bring five bucks. I am pleased to say that the BR box is resting peacefully in it's sneaky little <br/>
hiding place. I also attempted to get a heavy dose of peace and meditation this morning while searching <br/>
for the box by Canada Goose at the Grotto. It's a lovely garden but I learned that Tuesday is the day for <br/>
lawnmowing up there. Kinda spoils the tranquility. Lovely garden, an unusual stamp and a spectacular view <br/>
of planes taking off and landing while sitting in a huge overstuffed easy chair. Go for it! Funhog<br/>
