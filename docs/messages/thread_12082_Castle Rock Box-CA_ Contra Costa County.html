&gt; Hello~  I am new to letterboxing and i don't have my own webpage <br/>
or anything sorry, but I've planted a new box in the contra costa <br/>
county area.  To be specific, the box is at Castle Rock Park in <br/>
Walnut Creek. The directions and clues are as follows:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you're coming from Walnut Creek take Ygnacio Valey Rd. Turn <br/>
Right on Walnut Ave.  At the end, you'll make a Right on Oak Grove <br/>
Rd.,which turns into Castle Rock Rd.  Follow the road all the way to <br/>
the end, and park at the entrance gate.  (Parking is free.)  At the <br/>
gate you start on the path that takes you through the park.  You <br/>
will see picnic benches and what looks like a playground.  This park <br/>
is used for many large party picnics and such.  Continue on the <br/>
path, taking the Diablo Foothills Trail.  Keep following the main <br/>
trail until you get to a "T".  Bear Left and keep going on the path <br/>
until you get to the creek.  You'll want to cross the creek on the <br/>
Left side, not straight ahead.  Take the path upwards and to the <br/>
Right.  Keep going up until you get to "Cave Man Curry Cave".  This <br/>
is an interesting place to rest, as you have quite a hike a bit <br/>
ahead of you.  The path will continue on the Right of the cave.  Go <br/>
up in between the two walls of rock, over the one in the middle.  <br/>
Just after you get over the rock, you'll see a small clearing on <br/>
your right.  It's just a little grassy knowle (sp?) that takes you <br/>
to the edge of the cliff.  You can stand there on a boulder and <br/>
enjoy the view of the hillside.  If you turn directly around, facing <br/>
the main path again, to your right you'll see two small boulders.  <br/>
On the right of the boulders, and slightly in between the two, <br/>
you'll find my box.  Please hide it nicely when you're done.  Good <br/>
luck, and please email me if you have any trouble finding the spot.  <br/>
For those adventurous hikers, you can continue to take the trail up <br/>
the mountain and there is a secret way to get to the caves you see <br/>
directly above you.  This hike is moderately difficult and takes <br/>
about 35 minutes.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The date the box was placed was yesterday, Tuesday the 15th, <br/>
April, 2003.  This box is in Walnut Creek, CA, contra costa county. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just a shameless Bump!!<br/>
