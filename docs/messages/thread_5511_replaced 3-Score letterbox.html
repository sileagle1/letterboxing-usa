<div>Here are the revised clues to the 3-Score letterbox 
in Essex, CT.  The second box has been replaced and rehidden so that no 
destruction of the stone wall should happen.  These clues also lead to the 
"And Then There Were Three" tagalong box.  Enjoy!!</div>

<div>
<p>Location: Essex, CT. Relatively easy walk, Less than 30 minutes. Replaced May 
2002.</p><b><u>
<p align="center">3 Score Letterbox</p></u></b>
<p>Three score times two is a century and twenty.</p>
<p>To be together that long, there must be love a-plenty.</p>
<p>Don’t stop halfway, there are two stamps to this quest.</p>
<p>Once you see the pair, you’ll find that together they are best.</p>
<p>To begin this trek dedicated to these two,</p>
<p>Here is what you should do…</p>
<p>Park behind Captain Pratt’s old school, which now handles the town 
business—hope that’s enough information for you to get the gist.</p>
<p>You are led to the book keeper by the first walkway, you should pass this 
brick building to your right on this pleasant day. </p>
<p>The second brick walk leads you aCROSS (West Ave.)--to the PRESERVE, don’t 
get LOTS.</p>
<p>Proceed carefully through the two sets of sentries, both of whom are awaiting 
your entries.</p>
<p>Continue on now up the lane to a quiet place—no need to hurry, this isn’t a 
race.</p>
<p>Pass between two maples-1 sugar, 1 red—no, don’t stop here, forge on 
ahead.</p>
<p>If you have a thirst to quench, take a rest on Harriet’s bench. </p>
<p>…for that matter, bring your lunch!!!! Munch, munch, munch!!!!</p>
<p>Proceed down the lot to the European Beech, the treasure from here is nearly 
in reach.</p>
<p>Follow the woods path down to the right, the end of your search is almost in 
sight.</p>
<p>Step through the opening in the stone wall and HALT, turn right, be careful 
not to fall.</p>
<p>10 GIANT steps along the piled stones--check around carefully, be sure you 
are alone.</p>
<p>Look at the base of the wall on the ground level, and you will see a sight at 
which you will revel.</p>
<p>Centered between two cedars (on the back side)-- behind the one-foot square 
flat stone, does the first box hide.</p>
<p>You need turn no more than one stone at all; please do not damage the ancient 
wall!!</p>
<p>Continue along a ways to where cement has been poured so the stones won’t 
fall; here the other half of the pair awaits you all.</p>
<p>Just where the cement begins, look in the gap; the second box is tucked in 
the crevice under the cap.</p>
<p>The overhanging American Beech shelters from the weather, the hand-poured 
mortar which guards this treasure.</p>
<p>This letterbox was placed in honor of this pair</p>
<p>A special destination, we are glad you could share.</p></div>
