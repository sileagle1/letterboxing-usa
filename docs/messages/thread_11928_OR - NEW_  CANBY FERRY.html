Paisley Orca, at Molalla River State Park in Clackamas County in Canby,<br/>
Oregon.  <br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:  From Portland, go I-5 South and get off at the Canby<br/>
Hubbard exit 282A.  Turn left on Arndt Road.  It curves around nursery<br/>
and farmland and turns into Knight's Bridge Rd.  Follow this to Holly<br/>
Street (you'll notice these streets are tree names in alphabetical<br/>
order).  Turn left on Holly Street.  Go for a while following signs to<br/>
Canby Ferry.  When you see the sign for Canby Nursery on the left-hand<br/>
side you will then go down a hill and just around the bend is an<br/>
unmarked road on the left-hand side.  This is where you want to turn<br/>
left and go into the park.  If you miss it, just head for the ferry,<br/>
turn around, and coming back the signs will lead you straight to it.<br/>
Enter the park and go beyond Fir Grove and just past Cottonwood you will<br/>
want to park near the boat ramp.  <br/>
<br/>
DIFFICULTY:  Pathetically easy.  Practically a drive-by.  Not<br/>
handicap-accessible though.  Great place for picnics and dogs.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  Follow the hikers trail sign.  Go uphill.  Follow Molalla River<br/>
Trail Beach Access.  You will come to a metal gate.  DON'T go through<br/>
it. Instead, go immediately right on the trail toward the river.  Roots<br/>
reach right.  Beneath the concrete slab connecting two roots you can get<br/>
the Canby Ferry Letterbox.  Please re-hide well. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>
