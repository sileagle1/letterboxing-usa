                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sunday I revisited this box at Great Camp Sagamore almost a year after <br/>
finding it the first time. In September of last year I was there for a <br/>
week beginning a restoration project on a canoe that I had been carting <br/>
around the last 30 years. I finished the project this summer and <br/>
returned to Sagamore for a weekend gathering of their Boat School. It <br/>
was a beautiful weekend for paddling, swimming, hiking, sunning and <br/>
eating. Anyone heading into that part of the Adirondak Mts. should take <br/>
the time to drive in the four miles, find the Lb, and take the tour of <br/>
the camp. The box and its contents, BTW were in great shape.<br/>
