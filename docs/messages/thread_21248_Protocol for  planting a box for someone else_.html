Is there a protocol for when you give someone a box to plant for you?<br/>
Last Feb my Mom went to another state for a visit. Both of us carved a<br/>
stamp and a HH. Mom left her HH in a box out there and traded<br/>
letterboxes with her friend in that other state. Mom's friend planted<br/>
Mom's box and watches over it for her and Mom brought her friends' box<br/>
back to MI, planted here and watches over it for her friend.<br/>
<br/>
Mom gave the box and HH I made to another person out there but it<br/>
still hasn't been planted. I do send email to check on it and always<br/>
get an answer back. She is working on finding a good place to tie in<br/>
with the theme of the stamp image of the box. First the problem was<br/>
that the theater location that was going to be used for the box<br/>
refused permission. Ever since then the reason has been that this<br/>
person does testing of a location before putting a box out and every<br/>
testing location has been discovered by critters.<br/>
<br/>
Am I just being too anxious? It's almost a year and I was thinking I'd<br/>
already have gotten some finders and maybe some notes from a few of<br/>
them. The stamp and HH were just about the first things I ever carved<br/>
so they're kind of special to me. I do appreciate that she's working<br/>
to put it in a good logical place instead of just tossing it out in<br/>
the wild and not caring if it was safe. I guess I was thinking my box<br/>
and HH planting in this other state would go down faster; like my<br/>
Mom's and her friends' did. <br/>

1-how well do you know the person doing the placing??<br/>
If you know him/her well and feel comfortable...just give it to them straight ~ I always find this is the best coarse of action.....<br/>
2-if you're not all that comfortable with confrontation - just tell them that you don't want to burden them with all the placing/testing business....them have them send it straight back to you....hide it yourself, so that I can find it and send you a nice note telling you how beautiful the stamp is!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!!<br/>

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br/>
<br/>
Just out of curiosity, how is your friend "testing" locations for discovery <br/>
by critters?  I can think of a million amusing scenarios for that one but I <br/>
won't go there............<br/>
<br/>
Has your friend placed many boxes before?  Maybe it's the inexperience.  Or <br/>
maybe she's being extra careful because she knows it's "valuable" to you and <br/>
since it's not her own box, she'll feel guilty if it's vandalised or stolen by a <br/>
4-legged or 2-legged critter. Or she might be just trying really too hard to <br/>
find that perfect spot for that particular stamp.  You may have <br/>
unintentionally over-worried her about how important the box is to you, and, if she's <br/>
inexperienced, she may be trying too hard to be "perfect."  <br/>
<br/>
If it were a friend of mine, I'd just send a little empty box and some money <br/>
for postage, asking her to send it back to me since I'd come across the <br/>
perfect place to plant it right at home and I'd tell her how much I appreciated her <br/>
efforts and attempts on my behalf.  <br/>
<br/>
If it's been almost a year, that's kind of long.  I could toss in a bathroom <br/>
one-liner here but I won't.<br/>

<br/>
I recently called upon the wise boxing hog/sage to answer a similar question. I have <br/>
grand plans for a series in California. Knowing full well that an east coaster like <br/>
myself ain't getting out there anytime soon - I thought I'd call up on my left coasters.  <br/>
<br/>
This is a hard question to answer. I have a close friend living 1/2hr nearby the <br/>
location, but I ended up coming to the conclusion that it would best be taken care of <br/>
by moi personally....for several reasons...<br/>
<br/>
1. This person may be so focused on placing it in the "right spot" that they might <br/>
totally miss the point of what your box/series is about. For example - my said idea <br/>
for a series relates to the historical tour of this area. If the peson went off and placed <br/>
them on a trail outside of the downtown area - it would miss the point of taking <br/>
people through a specific area to see/find the box.<br/>
<br/>
2. This person may just not have your style and panache. In other words, if you <br/>
haven't had much experience placing boxes, then it takes a while to find good hiding <br/>
spots. You can't just expect somebody who is new to letterboxing to place boxes - let <br/>
alone those of your own!<br/>
<br/>
3. (My personal fave) placing boxes in someone else's hands is fine for cartaking, but <br/>
realize that for placing it is something you can't control. If they place a beloved series <br/>
in a terrible location, your efforts might go missing before anyone can find them. You <br/>
can't check on them either!?! <br/>
<br/>
So, best of luck. I see out-of-state-boxes as an excuse to visit an area again, and <br/>
hopefully to place more boxes in places I'd like to travel. Finally, if this person is <br/>
sitting on the box (ie: waiting and waiting and waiting around) well, tell 'em just to <br/>
send it back to you cuz you'd like to have it placed sometime this century!!! :-) <br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>
