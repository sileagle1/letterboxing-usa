<br/>
Seagirl also hasn't planted a box on the lbna site.  I wonder if Choi could check to see if she has a log on for lbna?<br/>

(this was an original thread on lbne.  For those who do not know what I'm talking about.... here's the summary.  Seagirl went to the Glastonbury Lady #1 and took the stamp and pad and replaced it with another stamp and some sea glass.  We're hoping to try and contact her so she can put the stamp back.)<br/>
