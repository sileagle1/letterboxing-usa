I want to thank everyone who helped me come up with a list of <br/>
letterboxes I could possibly visit while thru-hiking the Pacific <br/>
Crest Trail. Everyone who responded had really great info. A couple <br/>
of you requested info on a site where I will keep updates of my <br/>
journey. For anyone who is interested, the site is: <br/>
www.trailjournals.com/northerner/. Thanks again to everyone who <br/>
helped out.<br/>

For anyone who wants a little related reading between Ryan and <br/>
Patrick trail reports, if you have never read, "A Walk in the Woods" <br/>
by Bill Bryson, it is a great read about his trek along the AT.  It's <br/>
a few years old now, but still a page-turner and humorous as ever.<br/>
