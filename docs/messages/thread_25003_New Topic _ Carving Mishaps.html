                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, every time I carve, there are numerous mishaps. Some of them <br/>
even involve the carving material. (Oh yeah, I promised to stop <br/>
talking about bloody fingers.) Anyway, carving mistakes have never <br/>
stopped me from using a stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Taking this philosophy one step further, I think I almost like crude <br/>
stamps with imperfections more than perfectly flawless ones.<br/>
<br/>
I know several people (myself definitely not included) who routinely <br/>
produce amazing stamps that look like they were machine made. But <br/>
something weird has happened in my brain (imagine that!) where I've <br/>
somehow become jaded to their level of perfection. <br/>
<br/>
I mean, at first, when I saw these people's stamps I was just blown <br/>
away. Like, "OMG! How did you do that?" But now I've gotten used to <br/>
it, and I just expect them to produce masterpiece after masterpiece. <br/>
Yawn... another perfect stamp from one of the masters. How nice. <br/>
<br/>
I know... I'm horrible. Maybe I'm subconsciously trying to justify my <br/>
own existence by shunning people with more talent than I have. <br/>
Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I just know that when I see the work of someone who's still working <br/>
on their technique and making occasional boo-boo's, for some bizarre <br/>
reason I get more enjoyment out of it. Imperfection lends a <br/>
certain "shabby chic" aspect to the artform that I seem to miss when <br/>
I see the work of a truly great carver. <br/>
<br/>
And then, when I find a really crude stamp from someone that's just <br/>
started carving, I get all goose-pimpley. I feel like I'm getting a <br/>
rare glimpse into someone's very soul. And I know that this newcomer <br/>
probably put more effort into carving an amoeba-shaped butterfly (or <br/>
is it a squirrel? I can't be certain) than the ultra gifted carver <br/>
has put into anything they've done recently.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose, as an analogy, it's similar to the reasons why I tend to <br/>
prefer old-school blues music rather than a symphony orchestra. Both <br/>
are great in their own way, but I'm magnetically attracted to things <br/>
that are primative and folksy.<br/>
<br/>
I agree... there really is no such thing as an ugly stamp.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many of my stamps have been the victim of "one more cut..."  You gotta learn<br/>
when to stop!<br/>
<br/>
The other one that comes to mind is an injury - when I'm carving alot I<br/>
always seem to have knicks and scratches from the blades and the gouges.<br/>
One evening though, I managed to slice and gouge my middle fingertip at the<br/>
same time.  Blood came gushing and I tried to stop it at my workbench with<br/>
stuff out of my first aid kit I keep close by, but there was just too much,<br/>
so I went into the house to the kitchen to get some water running on it so I<br/>
could maybe counter the flow a bit and get pressure in the right place.  I<br/>
could've easily handled it myself, but as I walked in, I thought about the<br/>
fact that my son, Lightning, was working on his First Aid and Emergency<br/>
Preparedness in scouts, so I hollered for him and he came running (something<br/>
about the tone in my voice).  He immediately saw the blood trail on the<br/>
kitchen floor and the stream of blood running down my arm and I thought I<br/>
was going to have to revive him before he could help me - he will NEVER be a<br/>
doctor.  I told him what happened and told him he had to help me, and he<br/>
rallied enough to swing into action and get the job done.  I had to prompt<br/>
him a couple of times about "what next", but he managed quite well.  After a<br/>
couple of hours of having it bandaged, we uncovered it to look at it, and by<br/>
then it was a benign little cut.  He said "It sure isn't a very big cut for<br/>
so much blood!"  I told him fingers often bleed alot even if the injury<br/>
isn't too bad.  It was terribly sore for days though - the gouging part was<br/>
far worse than the slicing part, even if it didn't cause the bleeding!<br/>
<br/>
So there ya go DMS - a bloody finger story.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ah, Barefoot Lucy... I hope I never have to call upon my Cub Scout <br/>
son (9) to bandage me up, but what a great training opportunity for <br/>
him!  I myself am CPR and FirstAid-certified, but never had to use my <br/>
training until my mom (on blood thinners) fell and hit her head.  BOY <br/>
was I thankful I knew just what to do!  (Even IF I forgot to tell <br/>
someone to call 9-1-1; and my dad, whom I THOUGHT had left to do just <br/>
that, merely came back with a handful of paper towels.  We DID have a <br/>
Good Samaritan stop by and make a phone call for us.  I couldn't have <br/>
afforded to release the pressure on my mom's wound in order to get to <br/>
the cellphone in my pocket.)  Training... and practice... are good <br/>
things, even though we'd never wish for any injuries to test <br/>
ourselves with.<br/>
<br/>
Carve carefully, everyone!<br/>

running (something about the tone in my voice).  He immediately saw <br/>

posts but I'm a REAL newbie and have not even found my first <br/>
letterbox yet let alone put one out. It's been on my "to-do" list for <br/>
some time now, both to find and to plant, but there aren't many boxes <br/>
in my town at the moment and I don't "get out of town" often. Plus my <br/>
husband &amp; kids have gotten into the geocaching hot &amp; heavy and there <br/>
are LOTS of those in our town. Anyway, the lack of boxes in town is <br/>
why I want to plant one or a few, I have great ideas. I've mostly <br/>
just not got around to it because I think deep inside I'm a bit <br/>
intimidated by the thought of trying to carve my own stamp(s). But <br/>
you guys have given me hope and encouragement, I hope, to get <br/>
started. I may have to get back over to the craft/hobby shop this <br/>
afternoon and get some supplies and just go for it and "dig into" my <br/>
own stamp finally. I may, however, also invest in a finger/thumb <br/>
protector thing too! My boys were not in scouts so I'd hate to depend <br/>
on them to help me out if I had a "mishap".<br/>

&gt; &gt; it, and by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; then it was a benign little cut. He said "It sure isn't a very <br/>
big<br/>
&gt; &gt; cut for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so much blood!" I told him fingers often bleed alot even if the<br/>
&gt; &gt; injury<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; isn't too bad. It was terribly sore for days though - the <br/>
gouging<br/>
&gt; &gt; part was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; far worse than the slicing part, even if it didn't cause the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bleeding!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So there ya go DMS - a bloody finger story.<br/>

Have to agree with Randy on this one, yes they are some horrible, ugly <br/>
abuses of rubber out there.  Heck, some of them are mine!<br/>
