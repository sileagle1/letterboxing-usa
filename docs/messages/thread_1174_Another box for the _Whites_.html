Enjoy,<br/>

White Mountains  New Hampshire<br/>
Clue Difficulty: Moderate - Easy<br/>
Established: August 2000<br/>
Terrain: Difficult - Steady uphill and rocky<br/>
	2.4 miles - 2 to 3 hours one way<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Park at the AMC visitor center of the White Mountains, <br/>
Be sure to fill your Nalgenes at the water fountain.<br/>
<br/>
Take the most climbed trail to where you'd expect to find "one",<br/>
it will take quite awhile, so try to have fun.<br/>
<br/>
Now find the deck's south corner and take a bearing of 285,<br/>
Hike down the trail in your vision line.<br/>
<br/>
Travel along 50 feet or so,<br/>
Enjoy the bowl view with a spring waterfall below.<br/>
<br/>
Now a bearing of 150 degrees you need,<br/>
Take 26 paces and find a former cedar tree.<br/>
<br/>
At the trail head you'll need to look around,<br/>
In an easterly direction you will be bound.<br/>
<br/>
Watch for the sign that a horse thinks is horrid,<br/>
To that sign you must march straight forward.<br/>
<br/>
Now it's 50 degrees that you need,<br/>
And head NE past a side trail to latrines.<br/>
<br/>
Continue along you're where you belong,<br/>
Bear right at "T" intersection, singing a hiking song.<br/>
<br/>
Watch for a sign high up in a tree, <br/>
Continue NE, watch for a left "T".<br/>
<br/>
At the "T" take the left trail and soon on each side, <br/>
Look for the rails, no place to hide?<br/>
<br/>
Follow the path in a NE direction,<br/>
Watch for "VANCHON", no need for correction.<br/>
<br/>
Continue a bit turn left to the tarn,<br/>
Take a moment to enjoy, not a site for a barn.<br/>
<br/>
Return to the trail, hike on down to 4,<br/>
Pass right on by, soon your spirit will soar.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few steps to go, start down the hill.<br/>
Can you see the cross trail? STOP now at will.<br/>
<br/>
Take a 145 degree bearing, 3 paces, be boulder.<br/>
Be careful - don't trip over the fallen soldier.<br/>
<br/>
Look carefully past him, it's time now to fetch,<br/>
Your prize is sheltered, under a small stone bench.<br/>
<br/>
Be discreet and be careful. Stamp in and find out,<br/>
All about our box "Scout".<br/>
<br/>
Now it's time to return and finish this trip.<br/>
Return to the trail and head down to the "T", be careful - don't slip.<br/>
<br/>
Take a bearing of 140 degrees, hike a short way to the end,<br/>
Now another of 50 degrees and head down round the bend.<br/>
<br/>
Your journey is nearly over, it's been fun to roam.<br/>
Just pick your path carefully through the rock garden home.<br/>
<br/>
Dedicated to "EB" - our Scout<br/>
