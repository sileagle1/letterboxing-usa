far! We're having a ball.<br/>
<br/>
Our first box was "Little Gem" at the Levi Cole library in Middlefield -<br/>
- easy enough for my daughter to find on her own (proud Dad watching) <br/>
and contained a piggy-back clue.<br/>
<br/>
After logging our find, we set off accross the library grounds looking <br/>
for "Daisy Day"<br/>
<br/>
We were unable to figure out the "X" marking "the spot" while "peeking <br/>
through the pines" and so have 1 miss for 12 finds so far.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone found Daisy Day? and can you give us a tip?<br/>
<br/>
I e-mailed the owner of Little Gem, and am told that they don't know <br/>
anything about the piggy-back box.<br/>
