Diana's Pool in Chaplin CT, a hitchhiker called "Molly Looking for Ginger<br/>
will be launched. The object of this Hitchhiker is to reach Ginger the<br/>
Golden Retriever  Letterboxer in Vernonia Oregon. To give it a proper<br/>
sendoff, Anyone at the Molly Gathering will be able to stamp in. we want to<br/>
get some good East Coast stamps in the log so when it gets to Oregon they<br/>
will be able to see what us East Coast people have for stamps. Much more<br/>
information about the hitchhiker, and Ginger will be available in my next<br/>
post, at the gathering and on my website next week. Hope you all can make it<br/>
Sunday. This is a very letterbox rich area. Should have a good day of<br/>
boxing.....Chuck and Molly<br/>
