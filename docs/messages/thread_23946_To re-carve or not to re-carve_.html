<br/>
What a dilmena! I've had several boxes over the past few years go<br/>
missing. In this process I've learned a thing or two about good box<br/>
locations and unfortunately - bad ones! If you rehide in the same spot<br/>
and it is a perfectly safe location, you're good, but if you rehide in<br/>
the spot and it turns out missing once again - that's a sign.<br/>
<br/>
Some places were never meant to be. One particular special spot to me<br/>
is the Rose Garden in Deering Oaks Park. Though it is prime real<br/>
estate for a box, the rent is too risky. Twice these boxes have gone<br/>
missing. If I replant this box, it would be in an entirely different<br/>
location in future.<br/>
<br/>
Now, there was also a question a while back about recarving just to<br/>
recarve and whether or not that's a new find since it is a new stamp.<br/>
On that end, I would say not unless it is also in a new hiding spot.<br/>
The standpipe was recently recarved AND replanted in a new location,<br/>
so as far as I'm concerned - it's an entirely new box.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck on this one. <br/>
Cheers!<br/>

I just replaced my very first plant (I'm sure went missing due to my not understanding the plant coverage dye-down) and changed the spot and directions slightly and the stamp totally.

But so far this year has been great with having the boxes on my own little<br/>
website and with just a listing at Silent Doug's plus generally being under<br/>
my sig when I post.   It gives me somewhat of an idea as to how many of my<br/>
box losses were due to careless finders and how many were due to animals or<br/>
muggles finding them due to bad hiding places.  Since I haven't lost boxes<br/>
since moving them off lbna and atlasquest, that rather indicates to me that<br/>
the problems were neither due to animals nor accidental muggle finds.<br/>
