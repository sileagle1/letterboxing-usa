<div></div>A quick question if you please. Is it considered cheating if you take your artwork someplace to have a stamp commercially made instead of carving it yourself. The reason I ask, is that I have a design for my next box, but my attempts to carve it by hand have not worked out. I have tried several different mediums, but have as yet been unsuccessful. I made some calls and found that I could have it made for about $10.00! Then I started thinking that some might consider it to be cheating. Any and all responses are welcome.<br/><br/><br/>Happy Boxing,

&gt;A quick question if you please. Is it considered cheating if you take<br/>
&gt;your artwork someplace to have a stamp commercially made instead of<br/>
&gt;carving it yourself. The reason I ask, is that I have a design for my<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn't consider it cheating.  Some folks carve their own.  Some<br/>
use store-bought stamps.  A commercially made stamp falls in-between.<br/>
Not as special as one you made yourself, but better than a mere<br/>
off-the-shelf one.<br/>
<br/>
Myself, I think that I'd rather prefer a poor hand-made one than a<br/>
spiffy commercially made one.  But I certainly wouldn't consider it<br/>
cheating.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, my personal stamp is commercially made.  Years ago, a dear<br/>
friend of mine made a caricature of me, and I decided to have it made<br/>
into a rubber stamp, it's perfect for letterboxing.  But for the boxes<br/>
I've placed[1], I carve my own.  And if my carving skills get much<br/>
better, I may re-do my personal stamp.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Erich:<br/>
<br/>
I don't think there is any real cheating in the spirit of the game.<br/>
<br/>
One could make several analogies:<br/>
<br/>
The box:  sure, it would be very cool to use a old fashioned <br/>
carpenter's techniques to hand-build a very artistic box using wood, <br/>
inlaid metal, ivory, pearl, etc, but I don't think anyone will care <br/>
if you use Tupperware.<br/>
<br/>
The book: ditto.  It would be nice to make your own paper, bind it <br/>
together using leather or wood for the covers.  However, a <br/>
nice "gift" quality book from a stationary store, or even a simple <br/>
notepad works just as well.<br/>
<br/>
The compass:  A simple brass or plastic compass?  A fancy $300 <br/>
affair?  An electronic compass built into a GPS unit?  They all to <br/>
the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
The clues:  Posted on the internet?  How's that for irony in this <br/>
seemingly old-fashioned game! :)<br/>
<br/>
So, back to the stamp.  Sure a hand-carved stamp has a certain <br/>
personal quality to it, but in the end, it doesn't really matter.  If <br/>
one must keep score, then commissioning one from a personal design is <br/>
just as good, in my opinion.  Personally, I don't think there's a <br/>
real concept of cheating in this game, other than by logging things <br/>
you haven't really found.<br/>
<br/>
The important thing is to just get out there and play hide and seek <br/>
and enjoy yourself.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Erich, I used my lunch hour today to stomp around a park in West <br/>
O.  I got some mild ideas for a letterbox location, but <br/>
unfortunately, nothing that screamed "hide a box here!"<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
No, it is not cheating.  I gather that many people do that for their <br/>
signature stamps.  It is still your own original and creative <br/>
artwork that you designed yourself (or if a friend drew it for you, <br/>
that is OK too) and therefore a lot better than a store-bought stamp.<br/>
<br/>
As far as stamps that are placed in boxes, though, I am always much <br/>
more excited about finding a hand-carved one than a store-bought <br/>
one.  Just my opinion.<br/>
