<br/>
Someone recently (2 weeks ago) turned me on to letterboxing.  What a <br/>
GREAT hobby to share with the family!  We have found 2 letterboxes so <br/>
far (out of three attempts).  My daughter and I carved our own stamps <br/>
and my wife and 4yr old son are using store-boughts.  We have LOVED <br/>
the excitement, the outdoor experience, and the unique stamps we have <br/>
found.  <br/>
<br/>
In getting acquainted with the hobby I've run across a few things. <br/>
First--does "Box Under Construction' mean that the letterbox is NOT <br/>
at the location anymore?  <br/>
<br/>
Secondly, if anyone can recommend any 'kid friendly' boxes in SE CT, <br/>
that would be great.  We have found the CT State Stamp-New London <br/>
County box at Bluff Point, Groton CT and the Olive Oyl box at Fort <br/>
Griswold, Groton CT.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!  I look forward to chatting with you all in the future...<br/>
