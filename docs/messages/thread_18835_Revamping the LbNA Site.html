                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wes has already mentioned that the LbNA site design will be <br/>
undergoing construction and a site re-design is underway <br/>
(http://www.letterboxing.org/Contest.asp).  In addition, the <br/>
webmasters would like to revamp the contents of the site.<br/>
<br/>
Many of you have commented that it would be great if letterboxing.org <br/>
included... or allowed me to ...  Here is your opportunity to get all <br/>
of your ideas considered and make a positive change.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas that we will consider come under two categories - static and <br/>
dynamic.  The static portions include all the reference information <br/>
on the site - FAQs, boxing with kids, etc.  Good examples of this <br/>
would be additional carving information and examples, creative <br/>
logbook info, examples of microboxes, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
The dynamic portions include additional capabilities that you would <br/>
like in the database, allowing you, the user, more capability in <br/>
searching, adding boxes, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
All the caveats listed in the site design contest remain for this <br/>
content portion - By submitting, you agree: <br/>
that all designs become the property of LbNA <br/>
that you will be attributed for your work on the new LbNA website <br/>
that you grant LbNA a worldwide, perpetual, fully paid-up, non-<br/>
exclusive license to your entry <br/>
that you shall indemnify, defend, and hold LbNA harmless from any <br/>
third party claims arising from or related to that your participation <br/>
in the Contest. <br/>
<br/>
(thanks for the disclaimer, Wes)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, you are free to discuss your ideas on the talklist - take <br/>
advantage of the synergy.  To be officially considered, however, you <br/>
must submit your ideas to Wes, LbNA-Webmasters_at_yahoogroups.com or <br/>
to myself (trishkri_at_yahoo.com).  Why must they be officially <br/>
submitted?  For two reasons - the webmasters don't necessarily have <br/>
the time to sift through every posting.  Plus, the yahoogroup site <br/>
and letterboxing.org are two completely separate entities.  The <br/>
moderators on the yahoogroup site are not necessarily webmasters of <br/>
letterboxing.org.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to many great ideas,<br/>
Trish<br/>
