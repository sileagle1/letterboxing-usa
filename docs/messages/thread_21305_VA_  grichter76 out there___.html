We attempted to write the planter of the "Oliver Tocamp, the <br/>
Hitchhiker Stamp" HH letterbox listed as "grichter76" (???) with an <br/>
email address extension for further instructions but the provided <br/>
email bounced.  Anybody know the individual who planted this <br/>
letterbox back in 2002?  If so, please let them know we have their <br/>
HH and are awaiting further guidance.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt; Ironically, it looks like "Oliver Tocamp, the Hitchhiker Stamp"  <br/>
&gt; ended his westward journeys at the bad beginning lb on 26 Jan 05.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Launched from Virginia Beach, VA on 14 Apr 2002, his mission was <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; see the Pacific Ocean and boy did he get that opportunity these <br/>
past <br/>
&gt; few days.  We took him straight to the beach after rescuing him <br/>
from <br/>
&gt; a frightful spot today!  ;)  He'll be heading home soon...<br/>
