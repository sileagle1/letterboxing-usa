<br/>
Mrs Jiggs surprised me with a special LB planted especially for <br/>
Valentines Day!<br/>
<br/>
It's an easy little box to find, with very little, even-surface <br/>
walking. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did (though I don't expect <br/>
you to get the "sniffles" like I did!)<br/>

Peter's Valentine<br/>
Yuba City, CA<br/>
Planted Feb 14, 2004<br/>
<br/>
 My Dearest Peter,<br/>
<br/>
  If you were anyone else, you would have to take Hwy.20 west from <br/>
Yuba City, then turn right at the George Washington light, then <br/>
continue west on the Colusa Frontage road. You would then turn right <br/>
onto Royo Ranchero Dr. until you reach the first stop sign to find my <br/>
love.<br/>
<br/>
   But, you are you, so sweetie, all you have to do is walk out the <br/>
front door and go left to the stop sign to find my love for you.<br/>
<br/>
   I love you sooo much, let me count the ways.....<br/>
<br/>
   I love you more than all the  "lefties" in Yorktown. (Just for you <br/>
dear, that would include "righties" but for no one else.)<br/>
<br/>
   I love you more than if someone gave me four mansions that line <br/>
the right side of a street.<br/>
<br/>
   I love you more than my own "rights".<br/>
<br/>
   I love you more than "light" itself.<br/>
<br/>
   I love you more than "light" itself.<br/>
<br/>
   I love you more than "light" itself.<br/>
<br/>
   I love you more than "light" itself.<br/>
<br/>
   I love you more than "light" itself.<br/>
<br/>
   I love you more than my own "rights".<br/>
<br/>
   I love you more even if I was at the end of my road.<br/>
<br/>
   You cannot fence my love in, I would break free with a block of <br/>
cement if I had to.<br/>
<br/>
   Even a rock could not weigh my love down, for if you find it, I <br/>
will be yours forever!<br/>
<br/>
       Happy Valentine's Day Peter<br/>
<br/>
           Love Erin and the rest of the Jiggs clan<br/>
