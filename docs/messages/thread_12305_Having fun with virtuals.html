Well - I love living in Colorado, but I'm itching for weather that will actually permit me to venture out letterboxing!  We got SNOW yesterday *grumble*  and of course I had gone to work in a light spring dress and sandals.  Wishful thinking I suppose.   That'll teach me to leave the house without a coat in April.  *bonks self on the head*<br/>
<br/>
So, I've been virtually letterboxing as a way to keep my enthusiasm up.  I've gotta say, some of these are brilliant!  So far I've found Mischeif's Emerald City, CodyBCleo's Sunshine series, the Moo-Mah series - which I thought was very difficult, but was great fun - and I also found the VT Kimball Library stamp! (that one was also hard but fun!).  Now I'm working on Fish 'n Chips box while I wait for the snow to melt.<br/>
<br/>
Note to Webmasters:  <br/>
The VT Kimball Library stamp is not listed in the virtual boxes, but only with the rest of the VT stamps.   <br/>
<br/>
Also, there are a few virtual stamps listed on the main page that are either out of commission, or dead links altogether:<br/>
<br/>
ElizaB's virtual box has a dead link.  I let her know, but until she corrects it, it is out of commission.<br/>
Candlelight's virtual box(es?) are "down for maintenance". <br/>
and finally Wren's Virtual Letterbox, is completely a dead link. <br/>
