It seems in the spring clean up, Battle of Bunker Hill has gone <br/>
missing.  We went to the correct place, but could not find it.  I <br/>
emailed the placer (I hope it went through).<br/>

Happy boxing!<br/>

I'm kind of skeptical the box is missing--it's been reported missing<br/>
many, many times before but still turned out to be there.  But if<br/>
anyone who's found the box before and has nothing better to do than<br/>
mosey out and confirm its status, it would be greatly appreciated. =)<br/>

fairly well hidden, and we did our best to rehide it equally well. <br/>
I'm happy to give hints off-list if that's considered ethically okay!<br/>
