What a fun time we had!  Just the mom part of BeMa teamed up with Daughter <br/>
of the Old Dominion for our first stamping adventure together!  I am happy <br/>
to announce that she is a very nice and fun person and not a cyber <br/>
psychopath as some had feared (o.k. -- just my mom...)<br/>
<br/>
I told her that my "really bad sense of direction karma" was a potent force, <br/>
but I really don't think she believed me...  Several u-turns later...  But, <br/>
our bad directional luck disappeared once we hit the trail!<br/>
<br/>
This was a fun set of boxes, allowing us to use our imaginations as we <br/>
followed the clues like true the Sherlock Holmes.  I am happy to note that <br/>
we apparently had much better luck than Pychomommy -- it was funny reading <br/>
her notes of frustration knowing that she had triumphed in the end!<br/>
<br/>
Mary and I worked well together -- seemingly taking turns finding the boxes!<br/>
<br/>
I missed the kids, but, it was nice being able to choose MY OWN colors for <br/>
each stamp and Mary didn't whine nearly as much as Be and Ma (only kidding <br/>
-- she didn't whine at all!)<br/>
<br/>
Together we found the whole series and even had time for a picnic lunch!<br/>
<br/>
I'll have to go back with the family and show them the nature center and the <br/>
spooky swamp -- I think they'd get a kick out of it!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Mary for the great afternoon of boxing!  BeMa<br/>
