<p align="left">In 1996 Jonathan's Dream a fully 
accessible or universal playground opened in West Hartford, CT. A fully 
accessible or universal playground means that the playground meets all federal 
standards for safety so that it is accessible for children with disabilities. 
Mrs. Barzach had a vision for such a playground to honor her son, Jonathan who 
died in 1995 of spinal muscular atrophy. She and her husband raised $300,000, 
gathered over 1,000 volunteers and in October 1995 opened Jonathan's Dream! It 
is amazing and lots of fun for kids with or without 
disabilities! <br/><br/>Take Rte 189 and turn into the driveway for the 
Jewish Community Center &amp; Jonathan's Dream Playground.<br/><br/>Park directly 
in front of Jonathan's Dream. Stand Facing the Giant Rainbow. Turn and walk to 
your right until you get to the drive-way. Turn Left and follow the sidewalk. 
The fence that surrounds Johnathan's Dream Park will be on your left. When 
you come to the back corner of the fence you will see a clump of a birch trees. 
Look in the area behind the birch trees for your treasure. It will be under some 
wood and leaves. </p>
<p align="left">Please be as inconspicuous as possible. 
Infact please keep us up to date via talk list as you visit it so we know how it 
is 
doing! <br/><br/> <br/><br/></p></div></body></html>
