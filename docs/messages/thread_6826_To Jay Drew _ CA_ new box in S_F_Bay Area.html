Being somewhat of a newbie myself, I would've thought for sure that <br/>
someone as seasoned in letterboxing as you would've recognized what a <br/>
hybrid box is and consists of.  <br/>
<br/>
Just in case you don't though... A hybrid box is a combination of a <br/>
Geo-cache AND a letterbox.  It seems that the owner of this box chose <br/>
to share the geo-cache contents in the post AND since it is a hybrid <br/>
letterbox presumed that readers on the letterbox boards would know <br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">Over the past few days I've watched with mild interest as the <br/>
comments about newbies and hybrid boxes and first finders, etc. have <br/>
gone around.  Being a newbie, I was a little put out by the <br/>
generalizations made about newbies trying to rewrite the rules, but <br/>
realize it was not the opinion shared by everyone.<br/>
<br/>
It has been stressed on the LbNA site, on several personal sites and <br/>
within this group that there are no rules.  That is a double-edged <br/>
sword.  It leaves the door open to creativity, which is appealing to <br/>
most and allows a person to participate in the hobby from their angle <br/>
of interest.  It also leaves the door open for things such as geo-<br/>
cache/letterbox hybrids.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, one of the things that intrigues me about <br/>
letterboxing is it's history and personally I would like to see the <br/>
hobby in the U.S. hold as close to it's Dartmoor roots as possible, <br/>
understanding that time and circumstance necessitates some <br/>
modifications to the game.  In this respect I do not get excited when <br/>
I see things such as letterbox/geocache hybrids.<br/>
<br/>
I do recognize the similarities between geocaching and letterboxing <br/>
and suppose if I were interested in both, I might try to find a way <br/>
to combine the two into one activity.  However, I am not interested <br/>
in geo-caching so this hybridization does not interest me and makes <br/>
me feel as though the hobby of letterboxing is being pulled away from <br/>
it's roots.  My viewpoint does not come from lack of knowledge or <br/>
technical ability, as I actually use a GPS as my compass when I <br/>
letterbox.  I also mark each of my finds and plants with a user <br/>
waypoint on my GPS, for my own personal reference.  I just think <br/>
letterboxing is about stamping log books and following clues, for the <br/>
most part non high-tech clues.  Personally the little stash of <br/>
goodies contained in a geo-cache seems a bit trivial and immature to <br/>
me (even though I love Scooby-Do, I really have no interest in <br/>
scoring a Scooby-Do bandaid from a box in the woods), but then I am <br/>
40 years old and do not participate in this hobby with children, so <br/>
my angle on this may not be shared by everyone.  Call it being a <br/>
dinosaur if you will...  I'm not crazy about arena football either.<br/>
<br/>
As for first finders...  perhaps once you have reached the point of <br/>
finding several hundred boxes the thrill of being the first one to <br/>
stamp into a box loses it's excitement, but as a newbie, I got a bit <br/>
of an extra rush when I came upon a clean log book in the 3rd box I <br/>
hunted, and proudly noted this in the brief comments I left.  I like <br/>
the idea of a First Finders Certificate, and am toying with this for <br/>
a future plant.  Is this making changes to the hobby?  I don't think <br/>
so, rather it is playing with creativity and every box already has a <br/>
differing level of creativity -- themes, hand-carved stamps, custom <br/>
made and designed log books, etc.<br/>
<br/>
As for concerns about the environment and too many people trampling <br/>
an area.  Yes, but that could happen as the hobby of letterboxing <br/>
grows, with or without the geo-caching hybridization.  If an area is <br/>
truly that sensitive, there probably shouldn't be a box there.  <br/>
Hopefully all of those who participate, from whichever angle their <br/>
interest comes, are being conscientious about the environment and the <br/>
areas they are traveling through.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as this post demonstrates, we all have our opinions, and it <br/>
causes dissent within the group when we try to impose our opinions on <br/>
others or criticize those who do not share the same opinion.  The <br/>
main idea is just to get out there and find and plant boxes and have <br/>
fun doing it.  If I wear sandals and you wear purple socks, that's <br/>
okay.<br/>

&gt; &gt; No, I recognize that geocaching and letterboxing are different <br/>
&gt; activities.,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I see no reason to mix the two.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It will only create additional traffic to a place that shouldn't <br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; traffic to it to begin with.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Every time someone steps off the trail it causes damage to the <br/>
&gt; environment<br/>
&gt; &gt; of that place. Before long there will be a path where there was <br/>
&gt; none. There<br/>
&gt; &gt; will be trampled wild flowers where there once was beauty. In <br/>
other <br/>

&gt; &gt; ruining the very thing we came to enjoy.<br/>
