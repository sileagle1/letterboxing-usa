                    <div class="plaintext-content">Having just returned from the sunny Hawaiian Isles of O'ahu and Maui, I thought I'd <br/>
let folks know about the status of a few of the boxes there. I managed to meet up <br/>
with the newly initiated Hughes family (Tom, Viking, Shark Tooth, Tuff Hiker and ? No <br/>
Name Yet) on O'ahu to search for my 'I'wi letterbox, one that they had tried for once <br/>
before and come up empty-handed. I'm please to say that with the term 'butress' <br/>
freshly defined, the box revealed itself in short order. Aloha to my new letterboxing <br/>
friends!<br/>
<br/>
While on Maui, I heard from the Steubes that they had successfully found the two <br/>
Manu Make boxes, one mine and one by Legerdemaine, during the previous week. I <br/>
checked on my lightly visited King's Highway box and found that the only entry <br/>
during the last year was from the Brills, repeat visitors from Canada. I did managed to <br/>
place one new box in a very easy location. Hopefully, this one will see more company.<br/>
<br/>
Not to be satisfied with only checking on my boxes, I naturally managed to fit in time <br/>
to hunt down four Maui boxes. I was successful at tracking down the Fleshman's <br/>
Family Affair, the Mudstumper's Wiki Wiki Honu and the Playmaker's Makamaka'ole'ole <br/>
Stream boxes. I tried for the the True Colors box by Dreamer. Once I got to the <br/>
probable hiding place, I found myself looking at a lava wall in a taro garden. With <br/>
resounding admonitions against touching ancient Hawaiian walls ringing in my ears, I <br/>
walked around the thing for about a half hour looking for a probable hiding place. I <br/>
gingerly moved a couple of loose rocks but couldn't bring myself to do anything <br/>
more. The garden was lovely but I left this as one box unfound. No letterbox is worth <br/>
the wrath of Pele... or the state of Hawaii, for that matter.<br/>
