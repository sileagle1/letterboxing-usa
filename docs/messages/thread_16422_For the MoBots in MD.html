I visited Hidden Harvest and Testudo's Hideout Monday, both of which are in <br/>
good shape. I was the first finder for Hidden Harvest, my 3rd FF in a week! <br/>
The log book for Testudo's Hideout is very nearly full, however. If you can <br/>
change it out fairly soon, you might also take a look at how the parking lot <br/>
signage has been recently transformed and perhaps take that into account in <br/>
your clues for that box. (I'll admit, I didn't follow Testudo's trail all <br/>
the way from the library, since I am intimately familiar with the endgame <br/>
spot and didn't need the clues to get there). I was not able to find the <br/>
McKeldin Library box, though I'm pretty certain I was in the right spot. <br/>
Your yahoo e-mail account is full, or I would have e-mailed you off list.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
La Chola (who went boxing on Monday morning in a fit of absenteeism)<br/>
