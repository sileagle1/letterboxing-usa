WingNut is a slang term my dh uses for silly, off, crazy and ppl that <br/>
clown around.  Well, that would be me! LB is a letterboxing tag I <br/>
added to start up a yahoo account, I was suprized that wingnut was <br/>
taken in everyway I tried!  Also when we met I have a cockatoo, <br/>
McCaw, and about 30 cockatiels, (I was reising them at the time) so <br/>
it seemed fitting wing=bird nut=crazy.  I have used this handle for <br/>
about 6 years now!  So there you have it if any one was interested!<br/>
