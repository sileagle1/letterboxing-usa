                    <div class="plaintext-content">After attending to some silly business ("You're part of an exclusive <br/>
group and have won several wonderful prizes. All you have to do is <br/>
come to Ogunquit, Maine to get them, etc, etc, etc..."), I decided to <br/>
do something meaningful on the way home and stopped in Kittery to <br/>
search for the "Sea Horse" letter box. What an interesting site! I <br/>
could easily imagine the days of old at that old fort. Finding the <br/>
spot was straight forward after I realized that the placer had used <br/>
the rigorous definition of the word "pace", ie two steps.<br/>
<br/>
Quelle surprize! With only thirty-some f's in my log I found my first <br/>
hitch hiker! There was "2 for the Road" quietly waiting to charge my <br/>
batteries!<br/>
<br/>
I found that sneaky little box in excellent shape and snuck it away <br/>
with me.<br/>
<br/>
One interesting experience, the area had two other visitors. A man and <br/>
a boy were exploring. I was very careful not to be seen near the site, <br/>
but the boy saw me as I was ready to replace the box. To maintain <br/>
security I took the Sea Horse box with me for a short time and <br/>
returned later after seeing them driving away from the site. After <br/>
replacing  Sea Horse, I wondered if they had been letter boxeres as <br/>
well. They displayed remarkable curiousity about me. I hope I didn't <br/>
ruin their hunt.<br/>
<br/>
As for "2 for the Road", that hitch hiker is tired of cold damp places <br/>
and longs for some warmth and drier places. Finding him will increase <br/>
your frequent-flier miles! Of that you can BET!<br/>
