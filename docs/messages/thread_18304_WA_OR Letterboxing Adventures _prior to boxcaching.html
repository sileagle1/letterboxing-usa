letterboxes...some successes, some failures, some snakes, some mean <br/>
people, LOTS OF FUN.  =-)<br/>
<br/>
I drove to WA from Idaho and found Valley of Peace alive and well.  I <br/>
had actually driven by that park the month prior, but was looking on <br/>
the other side of the street and MISSED the park altogether then.  As <br/>
if I blinked and missed it-amazing.<br/>
<br/>
I attempted to find SamTONE'sHillENGE and Mary Hill Museum in WA, but <br/>
didn't.  With the first I hadn't deciphered the clues completely and <br/>
then with Mary Hill LB, I got there after the gate closed so as I <br/>
attempted to snoop around with the clues, I finally left as I saw a <br/>
car and felt like I was trespassing.  I'm such a wimp.  Thankfully a <br/>
week later, I returned and found both boxes doing really well.  =-)  <br/>
<br/>
While in WA, I had great plans to find TONS of boxes, but when it <br/>
started to RAIN and RAIN and RAIN while I was there, I was lazy in <br/>
front of the TV instead.  I did go out one day and found some at Ft <br/>
Steilacoom Park.  <br/>
The Fledgling, Haunted House, Leschi Gallows, Model Boat, and Fro <br/>
Clown with the Bounding Doe HH are ALIVE AND WELL.  <br/>
<br/>
On my way back to ID, I had great plans of hiking around the FALLS on <br/>
I84, but the RAIN attacked me so I wimped out again and only found <br/>
Olympia Beer Microbox, Jackson's Cabin in WA.  Then I found Three <br/>
Firs in Oregon and picked up the Back to School HH.  From that point <br/>
the RAIN dumped on me.  So in the pouring rain I found Healthy Living <br/>
in Troutdale (thanks to Sleepy Whippet for pointing out to me that <br/>
park when I visited last year so I knew right where to go).  =-)  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I realized as I went to stamp in that I had left my <br/>
plastic bag in the car, which Funhog recommended as a must have while <br/>
boxing in OR.  That wasn't smart on my behalf...what was I thinking?<br/>
<br/>
Well have a great day.  <br/>
