with limited time!<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is located on Turkey Mountain, a public space, located on Rte. <br/>
118 approximately 1 mile north of Rte.129 in  Yorktown Heights, New York.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
It was almost sunrise and Willy the raccoon had just scavenged the last of a <br/>
baloney sandwich from the parking lot trashcan.   He knew that he should get <br/>
back to his home soon because the hikers would be arriving and the thought of <br/>
seeing a raccoon in daylight terrified them!  With the last of the crust in <br/>
his tiny paw he scampered down the white trail.  When he came to the yellow  <br/>
dots on a tree that reminded him of his loving mother's paw print,  he <br/>
scurried off to the right.  He bounded up the 4 steps and finished the rest <br/>
of his tasty morsels.   Taking 132 raccoon size paces ( or 33 human steps) he <br/>
stopped at the marker on the tree the color of a scrumptious cherry.   Going <br/>
left he went  down 7 more steps......... he stopped to listen, and make sure <br/>
no hungry owl, coyote or other predator was around (because he was almost <br/>
home!).   Going right he ran the last 180 raccoon paces (or 45 human paces) <br/>
down to his mailbox.  This is two large rocks on the right...a perfect place <br/>
to sit.  If you find a leaf here you are sitting on his mail!   Now from here <br/>
it is all up to you to find the place you think this tired old raccoon Willy <br/>
resides.  In his home you will find the letterbox that has Willy's own <br/>
special stamp!  Thanks for checking out this tired old raccoon's home.  <br/>
Please leave the box well hidden- let us know what you think@ <br/>
