I tried posting this on the website, but it kept giving me errors and <br/>
wouldn't let me post it.  This is our first box planted and we are so <br/>
excited!  We really enjoyed this hike.  This is our first time <br/>
writing clues, and we hope they make sense!<br/>
State: Maryland<br/>
County: Frederick<br/>
Nearest City: Thurmont<br/>
Placed by: The Basses on August 3, 2003<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  Moderate - Some steep sections of trail and some loose <br/>
rocks (wear good shoes), but basically if these two couch potatoes <br/>
can do it, you should be fine!  I think there was a sign that <br/>
said, "No Pets," but I'm not definite.<br/>
<br/>
Cunningham Falls is located in Thurmont, just off of Route 15.  Go to <br/>
the William Houck Area of Cunningham Falls State Park, off of <br/>
Catoctin Hollow Road.  After paying your $2, drive towards the lake, <br/>
passing the first parking area for the lake beaches on the right.  <br/>
Soon after, you'll see a small parking area on the left with a sign <br/>
that says "Parking for Hiking Trails to Falls."  There are two trails <br/>
here.  You want the road less traveled on the left.  Begin your <br/>
ascent.  This trail is marked with yellow blazes.  While hiking up, <br/>
herds of deer regarded us cautiously around nearly every turn!<br/>
After hiking up for a little while, you'll notice blazes and markers <br/>
for other trails.  The path becomes marked with both yellow and blue <br/>
blazes.  Just keep following those yellow blazes.  Soon, you'll see <br/>
an orange blazed trail heading off to the left, and your yellow trail <br/>
makes a right turn and you start downhill.  Shortly after you start <br/>
travelling downhill, the path makes a sharp left and goes right past <br/>
a large fractured outcrop of rock.  From a distance it almost looks <br/>
like stone ruins.  Up close, it looks like a giant 3-dimensional <br/>
jigsaw puzzle made of stone.  There is a deep gap between the rock <br/>
and the trail, but it is accessible just to the right.  Stand on the <br/>
highest point of this flat-topped jigsaw puzzle.  Nice view!  Off to <br/>
the right, we saw two little fawns nestled in the underbrush near the <br/>
edge of the "cliff."<br/>
(Standing here, if you turn around you'll see 3 trees with yellow <br/>
blazes behind you, and the opening in the rock should be between you <br/>
and the path you just came down.)  Shoot a bearing of 310 degrees.  <br/>
Across the path, going downhill below you, note a smaller rock <br/>
outcrop with a large maple tree (about 2 feet in diameter) directly <br/>
behind it.  Walk down to that rock and stand on it, with the tree <br/>
right in front of you.  A little to the left (about 280 degrees) <br/>
you'll see a large rock with an overhang.  The box is wedged under <br/>
the overhang, hidden behind some smaller rocks.  Be careful reaching <br/>
under, as there were several spiders hanging around (particularly a <br/>
large black and yellow one - eeek!)  Use a stick or gloves to clear <br/>
the way.  Please be discrete, as you are not far from the trail, and <br/>
please re-hide carefully, since the box is visible from both sides.  <br/>
While hiding the box, a red fox climbed up the hill not 10 yards away <br/>
from us!<br/>
Now continue down the trail and admire the falls.  If you hike down <br/>
the falls, you can take the Lower Trail back to the parking lot.  <br/>
Unfortunately, the sun was setting, rain was falling, so we had to <br/>
beat feet back the way we came!  Hope you enjoyed the hike as much as <br/>
we did!<br/>
