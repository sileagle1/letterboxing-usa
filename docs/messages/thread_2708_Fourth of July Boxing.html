<br/>
4 out of the 6 Falcon Crew members romped around lake Frank today and<br/>
enjoyed a beautiful day before the rainstorms started. I'm always struck by<br/>
how remote it feels out there, given how close it is to bustling Rockville.<br/>
After finding Squirrel's Dragonfly box there (which was absolutely covered<br/>
with a large family of ants devouring the next generation of some other<br/>
creepy crawly critter.  Yucko Shmagucko!) we walked to the football<br/>
field-like meadow just below the ridge the trail is on. What a gas we had<br/>
running around playing tag on that field. Saw a baby deer and lots of real<br/>
Dragonflies.<br/>
<br/>
We really liked the way the Turtle box was tucked away too -- it was<br/>
cleverly hidden, which is not to say that it was difficult to find. It was<br/>
really cool.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a fun afternoon, Squirrel.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Everyone!<br/>
    Dan and I spent our Fourth of July hiking Mount Monadnock in New<br/>
Hampshire.  The weather was perfect for hiking, cool and sunny, but a few<br/>
cloudy periods.  We hiked from Monadnock State Forest and took the White Dot<br/>
Trail up to the Cascade Link to find Grand Monadnock #2.  There have been<br/>
several visitors to this box and it was in great condition.  From there we<br/>
continued up to the steep, but fun, Spellman Trail (Wanda, thanks for<br/>
recommending it, we loved it!)<br/>
<br/>
     Since the trail met up with Pumpelly right before the Sarcophagus, we<br/>
decided to look in on Grand Monadnock #1 which we stamped in to last summer.<br/>
As we came around it we saw someone sitting nearby, busily writing<br/>
something.  We asked if he was a letterboxer, and indeed he was!  We talked<br/>
for a while before heading up together to find Moon over Pumpelly Pines.  Of<br/>
all places to meet a fellow letterboxer, we never expected to meet one on<br/>
the Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
     Lonemasswolf, we found your box nestled between the rocks by what<br/>
looked like a giant grave with the sign making a cross on the top.  Just<br/>
what is under those cairns??  Several visitors have already stamped in.<br/>
After leaving our letterboxing companion we continued to the top where the<br/>
breeze felt great!  It was rather cloudy, so the view was somewhat obscured,<br/>
but still amazing.<br/>
<br/>
    After relaxing at the summit, and enjoying the view, we headed back down<br/>
the White Cross Trail to the Spruce Link and back down to the State Park,<br/>
where we collapsed in our car and headed back to CT.  We had a great day<br/>
trip, thanks to the Drew Clan and Lonemass Wolf, for hiding your boxes on<br/>
our favorite mountain.  We enjoyed hiking some different trails and<br/>
exploring the mountain.  Can't wait to back next summer.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone else took advantage of their day off!<br/>
Melissa<br/>
