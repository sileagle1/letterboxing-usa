Hello I have been trying to contact you via email regarding the <br/>
whereabouts of my Bonne Anne PLB.I havent heard anything so I <br/>
thought perhaps you had a new email address or something so maybe <br/>
i'd have more luck here.It was sent to you from NY about a month ago <br/>
and I was just wondering if you had recieved it.I will be in MA this <br/>
weekend and would like to pick it up if you still have it.Please <br/>
email me as soon as possible.Thank You.Happy Letterboxing!   <br/>
