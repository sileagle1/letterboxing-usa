&gt; You may be thinking of something on the line of<br/>
&gt; Nalgene labware.  That stuff<br/>
&gt; is mega sturdy, but pretty pricey.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A specimen cup has a larger diameter and volume<br/>
&gt; (100-125 ml) than a 50 ml<br/>
&gt; centrifuge tube and costs less than a Nalgene jar.<br/>

&gt; OK, just had to get that "desiccant" spelling<br/>
&gt; right-- two "C"s and one "S".<br/>
&gt; Sorry, folks, it's on the frequently misspelled<br/>
&gt; words list, along with<br/>
&gt; "misspelled" and I have a spelling-bee-er in my<br/>
&gt; household! Now, with that<br/>
&gt; out of the way, I have to say I really don't like<br/>
&gt; those Rubbermaid<br/>
&gt; containers. I've found about 2 dry ones in 6 months<br/>
&gt; of letterboxing, and<br/>
&gt; many with chewed holes. They're just too thin and<br/>
&gt; don't seal well. I<br/>
&gt; remember someone listing a website on here, maybe<br/>
&gt; 3-5 months ago, with some<br/>
&gt; kind of science tubes or earth tubes or geo-tubes or<br/>
&gt; something to that<br/>
&gt; effect. They were made for being outside. I think<br/>
&gt; they were thicker plastic,<br/>
&gt; maybe w/ screw-on lids? And were bigger in diameter<br/>
&gt; than centrifuge tubes<br/>
&gt; you're describing. Maybe I dreamed the whole thing<br/>
&gt; as my ideal letterbox. I<br/>
&gt; saved the post... will see if I can find it &amp; keep<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; posted! --lunaryakketyact<br/>
