of "tripping over boxes" or jealousy on the part of folks in states <br/>
that are less "well-endowed" than our extremely boxious neighbor, <br/>
but the fact is, in getting caught up on my state-by-state records <br/>
recently, I discovered that I have indeed passed the F2500 mark for <br/>
boxes found just in the state of CT alone! ( and this is before the <br/>
monsters of October make their appearance!!!) I guess with that <br/>
enormous number of boxes in such a relatively small area, we can now <br/>
be expecting to see more and more of the CT crowd reaching the high <br/>
F counts. It's a bit harder for us over in RI, since most of our <br/>
letterboxing forays over into CT include a 3 to 5 hour roundtrip <br/>
drive from our home, but that's still not too bad for a day trip!<br/>
<br/>
The thing I would most like to stress for people in other parts of <br/>
the country who may not understand the situation in CT, however, is <br/>
that high-count letterboxing in CT still requires tremendous <br/>
dedication and effort, even for the locals, and should not be <br/>
discounted as mere "turning over of rocks"! Unlike many other places <br/>
we have visited where drive-bys now seem to be the norm, most CT <br/>
boxes still require hikes, and even though the hikes do seem to be <br/>
getting shorter and the boxes more numerous, I do hope that the <br/>
hiking element continues to remain predominant in our neck of the <br/>
woods.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I would like to point out another interesting statistic <br/>
for any folks who still might think that I only have such a high <br/>
count because I live near CT. Consider this: even if I were to <br/>
eliminate every single one of the boxes that I have found in CT from <br/>
my total F-count (and not counting V's or PLB's either, which I do <br/>
not bother with because I prefer "active searches"),I would still <br/>
have found more boxes -nearly 2900- than anyone else has found in <br/>
the entire country including CT! Just something to pause and <br/>
consider before succumbing to delusions about boxing in CT! ;-)<br/>

things that first attracted me to letterboxing and I<br/>
still think maybe it's the best part. But I also like<br/>
many other elements, stamp carving journaling and<br/>
planning expeditions with my family. A quick drive by<br/>
or short walk can sometimes just be a nice way to<br/>
reconnect with a bored kid. So far my plants have been<br/>
drive bys but it is my ambition to do a long hike. One<br/>
of my first boxes was Cucumber Gap, about a 6 mile<br/>
round trip.<br/>
