Since AQ is acting so flakey today, I'm posting here instead.  It<br/>
seems my hosting service is experiencing problems and as a result, so<br/>
is Atlas Quest.  There's not much I can do about it but wait until<br/>
they fix the problem.  Rest assured, though, the site has not been<br/>
hacked nor has there has been any loss of data.<br/>
<br/>
There are rumors that https://www.atlasquest.com works better for some<br/>
people (it's safe to ignore the SSL certificate error your browser<br/>
will show you), but the SSL version is acting just as flakey for me,<br/>
so I'm not promising anything with it.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully they'll have the problem fixed soon and things will be back<br/>
to normal.<br/>
