<br/>
Okay, I'm a newbie.  I've read a lot of posts on the lbna and lbma <br/>
lists as well as this one, but I haven't seen a lot about this <br/>
subject, and I'd like to get everyone's opinion:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Should you get permission from the landowner (i.e., government owned <br/>
public lands) prior to placing a box?<br/>
<br/>
Or should you have a don't ask, don't tell philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My gut feel says to ALWAYS get permission to do something like this -<br/>
 without trying to be self-righteous about it, it just seems like <br/>
the right thing to do.  But the other half of my brain says why <br/>
bother - you're not going to hurt anything, you're going to take <br/>
care of the box, and only boxers are likely to find it, so what <br/>
difference does it make whether some county commissioner or park <br/>
superintendent knows and approves of what I'm doing.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Pennsylvania.  The state Dept of Natural Resources has a <br/>
policy ( http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/geocaching.aspx ) and my County <br/>
Parks also approve ( Chester County Permission for Boxes.doc in lbna <br/>
files list).  But here in PA, we have townships, county roads, <br/>
boroughs, cities, and who knows who else is interested.  My wife and <br/>
I want to place some boxes around the county on public property and <br/>
know that they would be properly maintained, but feel responsible <br/>
enough to ask first.  I spent all afternoon yesterday preparing <br/>
letters to officials seeking their policies: a township park, a <br/>
privately owned, but publicaly accessible nature preserve, and to a <br/>
county commissioner asking just who should I ask to place a box <br/>
around a covered bridge - don't know who's responsible for it, but <br/>
the commissioner's name is on the plaque.  These three are GREAT <br/>
places for boxes, but I'm concerned that I'm not going to get <br/>
permission.  THEN what do I do?  I don't just want to place boxes in <br/>
some of the same places others in my county have done, but I'm <br/>
unsure whether they bothered to get permission or not.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, this will generate some debate.  And if it's been debated <br/>
in length before, please don't flame me, I just haven't decided <br/>
completely yet.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

You have raised a worthy topic and one that has been re-visited many times since the inception of LbNA in 1998.  The most direct way to answer your question is to ask you, and everyone, to go to the main page of  www.letterboxing.org and click on the Terms of Use.  You will see that by placing clues on the LbNA site you warrant that permission has been obtained.   <br/>
<br/>
In the early days of boxing things were much more loose and many subscribed to the concept of secrecy; that concept created significant negative feedback from natural area managers.   We ask you to obtain permission, to respect historical and natural areas and participate WITH land managers.  When this happens, we gain more advocates for our past-time.<br/>
<br/>
Thank for bringing this up - it is a timely post.<br/>
<br/>

Thanks for your post.  I thought I had read everything on the LBNA <br/>
site- apparently I missed that Terms of Use.  I'm usually pretty <br/>
thorough - perhaps it should be someplace else as well, like under <br/>
the FAQ or Rules or something?  Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for replying.<br/>
