Eastern Massachusetts", and stumbled upon Summer Visitors at Henry's <br/>
Sawmill LB site.  We, The Purple Larva Group, are honored to be the <br/>
first to further the journeys of this hitchhiker.  We like the <br/>
handcarved stamp and are intrigued by the small notebook you sent <br/>
along.  Gotta see if we can find one too.<br/>
<br/>
The HH will be on its way soon, to an undisclosed location (we have <br/>
not picked a destination just yet).<br/>
<br/>
Nice walk, with the underbrush deleaved the sawmill site is plain to <br/>
see.<br/>
