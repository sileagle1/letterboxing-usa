In 1929, Adele von Ohl Parker, protegee of Buffalo Bill, relinquished the <br/>
stage life of county fairs, vaudeville houses and silent movies to settle in <br/>
North Olmsted, Ohio. She created Parker's Ranch, where for 37 years she <br/>
taught youngsters how to ride, including me! This box is planted near the <br/>
bridle trails we rode and is dedicated to her memory. For more information <br/>
about this remarkable woman, read 'The Search for Adele Parker' by Robert <br/>
Charlton Hull.<br/>

Directions:<br/>
Take I480 to the Columbia Road (Rt 252 ) exit. Go south on Great Northern <br/>
BLVD. to Butternut Ridge. Turn left onto Butternut Ridge. At stop sign take a <br/>
left onto Columbia. At the light, take a right down Cedar Point Road. Shortly <br/>
after crossing a bridge over the Rocky River, take a left onto the Valley <br/>
Parkway. You will again cross another bridge over Rocky River. Take a left <br/>
into the parking lot of the Rocky River Nature Center. Proceed through the <br/>
main parking lot and park in the smaller auxiliary lot beyond. Trail guides <br/>
are available in the Nature Center, though not really necessary for this hike <br/>
(very easy!)<br/>
