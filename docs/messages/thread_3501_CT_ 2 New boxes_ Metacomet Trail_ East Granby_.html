Metacomet Trail<br/>
East Granby, CT - Hartford County<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Take exit 39 off I-91, heading west on Rt. 20.  Proceed for <br/>
approximately 8 miles until you come to the intersection of Rt. 187 &amp; Rt. 20. <br/>
 Continue up the hill, and take a right at the signal light (Newgate Road).  <br/>
Park along side the road; the trailhead is on the corner of Rt. 20 and <br/>
Newgate Road.<br/>
<br/>
Planted on 10/14/2001 by Team Weems (and friends).<br/>
Approximate time:  1 ½ hours   <br/>
<br/>
Start at the trailhead, this is a blue blazed trail. The start of this trail <br/>
is a BIG hill - we dubbed it heart attack hill :) - but don't get <br/>
discouraged, there is a big rock to rest and take a much needed drink of <br/>
water atop that hill.  This is the hardest part of the trail, and once you're <br/>
up it, the rest of the hike is quite nice.  Follow the blue blazes, cross <br/>
over a rocky stretch of the path.  Step over a fallen log, and then over (or <br/>
under if you want to belly crawl) a second fallen log.  Notice a large rock <br/>
on your left made up of many thin layers.  Go under a fallen tree leaning <br/>
across the trail.  Another layered rock on your right.  Watch your step, as <br/>
the path turns rooty and rocky.  Keep on following the blue blazes, it's the <br/>
only way to go.  Scoot around two fallen trees, making the path do a zig-zag, <br/>
go around the corner to the twin tree arches.  This is where the monkeys come <br/>
out to play!  (We take this hike every fall with friends, and we have yet to <br/>
pass by these trees without our four little monkeys climbing these arches!  <br/>
This box is dedicated to them.)  Stand by the arched trees and to the right, <br/>
off the path is a multi-trunked tree.  The Barrel Monkeys lives behind this <br/>
tree.  Stamp on in, and keep on following the trail.  The trail climbs up and <br/>
hugs the edge of a drop-off, then turns to the right - rocky trail ahead.  <br/>
Blue blazes, on up we go, over another fallen log.  The trail goes up over a <br/>
rocky ridge.  Look for the strange little L-shaped tree on your left, what a <br/>
nice place to sit and have your picture taken!  You've almost made it to the <br/>
top, so up, up, up you go to the top of a beautiful look out.  You are sooo <br/>
close to the next box, so keep on going (you can come back and stamp in here <br/>
if you'd like).  There are two survey discs in the ground.  At the second <br/>
one, count 35 paces, the trail forks, keep to the right.  Spot a fallen tree <br/>
on your right, look behind the stump of this tree for your treasure.  Go back <br/>
to the outlook.  Holy Cow… What a View!  Return the way you came to get back <br/>
to your car.  Hope you enjoy this hike as much as we do, it's especially <br/>
beautiful in the fall.  <br/>
