letterboxes at North Quabbin Reservoir in Pelham, MA, sent me news of <br/>
logging in the area that has affected part of one of the clues.  So <br/>
I've updated the clue for the Salamander box, which is on this page:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.crocker.com/~bsennott/amherstboxes.html<br/>
<br/>
He also sent a wonderful photo of an actual salamander perched on the <br/>
log hiding the letterbox and gave me permission to add it to the page. <br/>
Take a look!<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, rainy weekends and other obligations have prevented me <br/>
from getting over to Wendell State Forest to check on/improve the box <br/>
locations there.  I'll send an email when I finally get around to <br/>
that. <br/>

P.S. As long as I'm writing, I'd just like to say that, as the first <br/>
letterboxer (I'm pretty sure) in Massachusetts and one of the original <br/>
bunch to get involved with LBNA in 1998, I am dismayed by some of the <br/>
conflicts that have been played out recently on this list.  For those <br/>
of you who are newcomers, I hope you realize how much time and <br/>
effort have been given by the LBNA Webmasters and the moderators of <br/>
this list, who put in countless hours to make this site happen.  I <br/>
have seen it grow, go through redesigns, and get better and better.  <br/>
It is a volunteer, team effort and one that, in my opinion, is well <br/>
worth supporting. I've met many of the current and former Webmasters <br/>
and I know they have busy work and family lives, yet they somehow find <br/>
the time to keep this site going--and not just keep it going, but <br/>
constantly build and improve it! Perhaps having multiple letterboxing <br/>
clue sites is a good thing--I've no idea, really--but I DO know that <br/>
the LBNA site is a very good thing. I encourage all of you who have <br/>
your clues posted on the LBNA site to please thank the Webmasters once <br/>
in a while and let them know that their efforts are appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
And last of all--Happy Father's Day to all letterboxing dads!<br/>
