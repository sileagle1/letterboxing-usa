<div>A new Hitch Hiker was placed today, 12/29/2, the SS LB

<div>This is honor of the nice lady who, with her diminutive

single-handedly.  In the short time they have been on the trails, they have 
found over 220 and placed over 50 Letterboxes!  There enthusiasm is 
contagious, others in the area have picked up the pace, providing more adventure 
for those with Letterbox Fever.  She wanted to attend a Gathering, so 
decided to make one happen.  Over 30 attended for a great day of fellowship 
and letterboxing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This HH is sent forth in her honor.  It has been

3rd attempt at this message...UGH!!!  Satellite connections these <br/>
days!!!  Hope it works this time around.  I'm tired of writing it!  <br/>
Here goes...<br/>

<br/>
Hey, so you wanna be goddesses, too?  Well, I dub thee SS Goddesses <br/>
of the Dawn (for first placements of letterboxes in the region).  <br/>
Would you rather be Gods???  ;)  In fact, Tacoma Nature Center &amp; <br/>
Titlow Parks were among our first finds, so in our hearts, you are <br/>
VERY SPECIAL to us!!!  You gave us the proof that this letterboxing <br/>
hobby wasn't just a fictitious scavenger hunt activity listed on the <br/>
internet someplace AND you provided us the incentive to place boxes <br/>
where other letterboxers hadn't yet ventured...<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I think Fudrick was referring to quantity over quality.  <br/>
Your boxes are of the Nordstrom/Neiman Marcus/Sharper Image variety <br/>
and mine are more on the level of Wal-Mart or more precisely--thrift <br/>
shop exclusives...  ;)  Boy, if I only had my own arc welder and jig <br/>
saw.  I've got a couple dozen altoid tins just lying around!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to locate Mr. Fontaine.  Thanks for another reason to <br/>
head up North!  After all the extra work I've given to the TPD this <br/>
summer, I guess helping them find Mr. Fontaine would ease their <br/>
burden a bit?  Wonder if they ever caught the jerk who broke into my <br/>
car in July anyway?  Hmmmmmm, I'm not holding my breath anymore...<br/>
<br/>
Have a great New Year!<br/>

I would have wanted to be there!<br/>
<br/>
Then figured out that Fudrick was referring to the gathering at Fort Steilacoom.<br/>
<br/>
some days are harder than others.........<br/>
<br/>
It could have been your case Fontaine was working on!<br/>

Thank you so much, Fudrick.  This HH is a very nice gesture!  <br/>
Though, I'm not sure I can live up to such legendary heraldry as a <br/>
goddess?  At least, I'll try to sell it to my kids, though...as long <br/>
as they're still listening to me.  Did I actually say that they <br/>
still listen to me?  Oops, they haven't listened to me in ages and <br/>
they're not even teenagers yet!  In fact, one just life prime <br/>
numbers and the other just made it to his first digit...<br/>

PS  Third attempt at this message, too.  Is this a bad sunspot cycle <br/>
or something?  This satellite link is hiccuping all of the time!!!<br/>
