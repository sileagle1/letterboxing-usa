                    <div class="plaintext-content"> On December 7, 2001 Funhog placed the Ide Adobe Letterbox near Red Bluff<br/>
in Tehama County , California. This park is the site of the homestead<br/>
settled by Massachusetts emigrants Susan and William B. Ide in the spring<br/>
of 1846. By June of that year, the government of Mexico decided to reclaim<br/>
their lands in California and to evict American settlers. Not at all<br/>
pleased with this plan William Ide led an uprising of his fellow<br/>
homesteaders called The Bear Flag Rebellion. Unaware that the United States<br/>
government was already at war with Mexico, the rebels  seized Sonoma and<br/>
made it the capital of their newly formed Republic. The Bear flag was<br/>
raised on July 9 and William Ide was inaugurated as president. The Republic<br/>
was short lived. Ide returned home by November but did go on to serve in<br/>
local government until this death in 1852.<br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: from I-5 just north of Red Bluff follow exit signs to the<br/>
Ide Adobe State Historical Park.<br/>
<br/>
to the Letterbox: Standing on stone you will be gazing on an idyllic living<br/>
tableau: a gargantuan oak spreading its limbs over a tidy adobe home  The<br/>
entire scene is perfectly framed by unpainted timbers. The letterbox is<br/>
just to your right behind a loose, flat stone.<br/>
