Diego Sails stamp image is in the example photos in the<br/>
Photo and Imaging Gallery of the editting software that<br/>
comes with an HP printer.  I would love to hear if anyone <br/>
else can find it.  I guess I could make this a new kind of<br/>
letterbox with the clues being "Look for the stamp in<br/>
HP Printer software and print it out on your new printer".<br/>
I'm not too upset if my image is being used by HP (it<br/>
is available for anyone to see or download on my own web<br/>
page), but I do think they should have asked first.  I<br/>
would have recommended a better carving from someone more<br/>
deserving! <br/>
