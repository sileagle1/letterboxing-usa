<p>Planted July 4, 2002, by the Five Pedaling Rink Rats.</p>
<p>Here is a link to a trail map:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.atatrail.org/seg-maps/yok9.htm" target="_blank">http://www.atatrail.org/seg-maps/yok9.htm</a></p>
<p>This box is located along the Youghiogheny River rail trail, north of Ohiopyle State Park, in southwest Pennsylvania.  This is the most beautiful rail trail we have ever ridden on and is well worth a weekend trip.  Awesome scenery!</p>
<p>Start in Connellsville.  Find the trail on the south end of town, just before it leaves town.  There will be a playground and a "Welcome to Connellsville" sign.  Washington DC is 279 miles from here, Cumberland MD is 90 miles, Confluence, PA is 27 miles, and the town of Ohiopyle is 17 miles.  The box is located approximately 2.4 miles from here. </p>
<p>Start walking or riding your bike south.  Count benches.  </p>
<p>2 benches</p>
<p>bridge over junkyard</p>
<p>another bench</p>
<p>bridge over a power station next to a factory</p>
<p>a bench</p>
<p>a bench with a roof</p>
<p>The next bench is by a waterfall.  It is on the right side if you are headed south.  Stop here. You are approximately 2.4 miles south of the "Welcome to Connellsville" sign where you started.</p>
<p>Across the bike trail from this bench is a gravel path leading to the river.  Start heading down this "main footpath".  55 very short (it is steep) paces down the hill, you will see a  smaller footpath on the right leading to the river.  The main footpath eventually leads to a 30 ft. tall rock over the river.  If you get there, you have gone too far and missed seeing the smaller footpath.  </p>
<p>Back to the intersection of the two paths (assuming you didn't miss the small path the first time..) From here, count 8 regular paces farther on the main path.  Turn to your left and face the rock wall.  There is a big diagonal cut in the rock in front of you--it is about 6 feet up.  The box sits behind two smaller rocks.  They are about 6 feet to the right of the largest tree growing in front of the rock wall.  The box is a small sandwich box and contains a stamp and a small notebook.  </p>
