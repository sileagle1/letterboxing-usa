Just wanted to say hey and that I am new to Letterboxing. I don't <br/>

this seemed like a good way to meet people and have a good time. I <br/>
guess I have a lot to learn and could use some good pointers other <br/>

friends we found a box that was completely accessible<br/>
for a wheel chair. It really brought to my attention<br/>
the need for all kinds of boxes out there.I plan on<br/>
planting some here in PA that are accessible to all. <br/>
I don't know what your limitations for boxing are but<br/>
you could really plant some fantastic boxes that<br/>
everyone could access.<br/>

<br/>
I'm so glad you joined this group - you're going to give us all<br/>
something new to consider! Maybe someone could correct me, but didn't<br/>
lbworld have a code to indicate whether boxes were wheelchair<br/>
accessible? (The site has been down, so I couldn't check)<br/>
Due to some health issues last year, I'm slowly working my way back up<br/>
to longer or more strenuous walks/hikes, so I'm always grateful when<br/>
folks indicate the roundtrip mileage &amp; difficulty of terrain!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
