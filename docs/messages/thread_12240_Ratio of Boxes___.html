Interesting that you mention that because I've noticed the same thing <br/>
as I have been out checking boxes this spring.  The first place I saw <br/>
a slight path to the box spot, I was excited because it appeared many <br/>
people had been there, but alas, no visitors since fall, and even <br/>
then, only a handful total.  Makes me wonder about places on the East <br/>
Coast where the boxes have more visitors in one weekend than mine <br/>
will see all summer.  Is this a problem for you folks too?<br/>

followed a faint little deer trail, but after the box was planted, the <br/>
trail seemed so much more obvious. Maybe it was just because we knew <br/>
where to look....<br/>
