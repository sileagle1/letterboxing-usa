<div> </div>
<div>Found your letterbox along the shore walk at BH today. Found clues for letterbox that has the followng clue:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"A few miles to the east, as a duck were to fly, There's a babbling brook and an arch through the sky. 'cross this graceful stone span, on the downspilling side, beneath cedar sapling another box hides"</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There's only one problem with this, from the shore walk at BH, "A few miles to the east" puts you out in the Atlantic Ocean. Perhaps you meant "West". Or maybe Maine ducks are just really disoriented. And, there are two arch bridges a few miles to the west that meet your criteria. The one it appears most likely to be is the Duck Brook Bridge, but it is a triple arch and you seem to indicate a single arch. The only other arch bridge directly to the west is the Eagle Lake Bridge, but that runs over a carriage road and not water.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Some clarification please.</div>
