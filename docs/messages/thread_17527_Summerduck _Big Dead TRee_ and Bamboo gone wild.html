<br/>
"Big Dead Tree" is doing fine. SOmeone had even left a hitchiker <br/>
there.<br/>
The root ball that the box is hidden is about 3-4 feet across and you <br/>
may have to look a bit to find the box. Hell...I placed the box and <br/>
it took me 4-5 minutes to find it. It's a round tupperware container <br/>
(white)..about 3 inches across....so if you kick some leave/dirt <br/>
around, it'll show up.<br/>
<br/>
"Bamboo Gone Wild" could not be found...and for a good reason. There <br/>
were huge sand bars and leaves 2-3 feet up the bamboo....obviouly a <br/>
small flood had been through/ I will replace it in the next week or <br/>
two.<br/>
