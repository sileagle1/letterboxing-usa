On the way home from school today, my girls and I *finally* stopped at <br/>
Walker Nature Education Center on a "treasure hunt" to look for the two <br/>
original Audubon boxes there.  On previous attempts, it has rained or <br/>
someone has needed a pit stop or it's gotten too dark or the younger one <br/>
has fallen asleep before we could park.  Really ridiculous, as we drive <br/>
very close to it (though not past it) on many days.<br/>
<br/>
A bit chillier than the girls were hoping for, but it was a lovely <br/>
November afternoon - reasonably warm, partly sunny, little wind.  Lots <br/>
of nice crunchy leaves.  We found the first box without much trouble but <br/>
never did find the second.  I poked around for a long time up one side <br/>
of the rooted fallen tree at the end of the perpendicular tree - <br/>
nothing.  Poked back down the other side of it - nothing.  Has it been <br/>
reported MIA?<br/>
<br/>
First box had a beautiful stamp - last stamper visited 8/22/04, BTW, and <br/>
used gold ink, but the stamp was a bit bigger than our inkpad ;-&gt;  Box <br/>
was nice and dry, though the towel around the stamp was slightly damp <br/>
and we didn't have a replacement with us.  Resealed &amp; rehid it very <br/>
well.  They were disappointed that we couldn't find the second box. <br/>
