from out of state I figured that like all visitors to Portland, OR she <br/>
would want to see the Columbia River Gorge. The rain managed to keep <br/>
its distance while we were hiking. Wildflowers are everywhere, the <br/>
fields are blindingly green and the waterfalls are running full force. <br/>
It's a great time to hit the trail. I found a cozy spot to leave this <br/>
traveler but I'm sure a lift would be appreciated. Funhog<br/>
