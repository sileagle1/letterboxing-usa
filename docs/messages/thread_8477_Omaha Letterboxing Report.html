                    <div class="plaintext-content">While in Nebraska, I did some letterboxing (of course) -- here's a report <br/>
on the boxes I found and couldn't find:<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't able to find the West Fairacres Feather-light box. I did find the <br/>
pillars and the duck, and searched all the "obvious places," but there was <br/>
no box to be found. I know this microbox has gone missing before -- perhaps <br/>
it has disappeared again.<br/>
<br/>
I also couldn't find The Troll in Ralston. It was very muddy on the banks; <br/>
perhaps he relocated himself to dry ground after the recent rains.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to find Elmwood Park, Lunar Odyssey, Armbrust Park, Papillion <br/>
and Portal without any trouble.<br/>
<br/>
The Lunar Odyssey box has a big hole in the lid where some critter has <br/>
chewed through. I double-bagged the contents before I replaced them. The <br/>
Portal box was wet inside, even inside the bag with the log book (though <br/>
the book itself is fine). I dried it thoroughly, double bagged it, and it <br/>
should be fine. I particularly liked Elmwood Park and the grotto -- this is <br/>
a very nice urban park.<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning a trip to Lincoln on Saturday to visit the couple of boxes <br/>
there. The links to the Prairie Peace Park web site no longer work, <br/>
however, and a web search doesn't turn up any contact information or other <br/>
sites about it. I'll see if they reply to email or will give them a call.<br/>
