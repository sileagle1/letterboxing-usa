responded that we should check out geocacheing and <br/>
letterboxing.  Since we did not have a GPS or have the money to <br/>
buy one, we looked into letterboxing first.  We found the LBNA <br/>

<div><br/>In April of 1999, I was shopping at EMS in 
Waterford (CT) for Dan's birthday.  While I was waiting to pay I saw a 
brochure that said What is Letterboxing.  I read a little of it and 
thought, "Wow, this sounds really cool!"  Dan and I did a little hiking on 
the weekend but really only knew about the state parks.  So I asked the guy 
about it and he gave me a copy of the brochure and a few of the clues.  
They were just starting and going to try to put out a new one every month.  
I'm not sure if the web site has started yet, so I just kept going back to EMS 
every once in a while for the newest clues (all of which were Drewclan 
boxes!)  In one box a while later the website was written in.  I ran 
home to check it out and was like a kid in a candy shop!  There were so 
many clues to so many boxes, we didn't know where to start.  Now nearly 4 
years later there are so many boxes just in CT and RI alone that I know we'll 
never be able to find them all unless we quit our jobs and start searching full 
time!</div>

A few years ago I came upon Dartmoor letterboxing info. on the Net... But
just this past fall I happened to see LbNA's site listed on Yahoo's Picks...
checked it out, and immediately scouted out my first (and local) letterbox.

<div><span class="550561201-17022003">I found a box hidden 
by the saddle sore riding club on the airline trail. It didn't mention anything 
about letterboxing and looked as though it might have been some idea that they 
had. I liked the idea but thought little about it for several years. One day 
while Molly and I were walking in Schoolhouse Brook Park in Mansfield CT, we 
passed a man walking while looking at a piece of paper. Later on, we came up on 
him again. He was coming back on the same trail. I stopped and asked him about 
what he was doing. He told me some very basic things about letterboxing but did 
say that there was even a box very close to where we were in a stone wall. Right 
near a trail. Knowing the area, I went to the closest spot that was like what he 
described and found Leader of the Packs "Chick in a nest" letterbox. The box had 
a couple faq info sheets in it. I took one home and started boxing quickly 
after that....Chuck and Molly</span></div></body></html>

To protect the guilty, I won't reveal names, but I actually know of <br/>
four people who've discovered letterboxing that way--discovering one <br/>
of my clues on an Internet search.  I suspect there might be others <br/>
who are shy and never wrote me to tell me about stumbling upon one of <br/>
my clues, but looking at how people have reached my pages, there's <br/>
been a lot of click-thrus coming from search engines.  Most of them <br/>
probably read it and move on, but like I said before, at least four <br/>
of them have gotten serious enough about it to carve signature stamps <br/>
and e-mail me about it!  =)<br/>

My wife Lori , myself and my son Ryan, had always had an interest in <br/>
some of the stranger places and things to be found here in New England<br/>
(The Stone Knight, Americas Stonehenge, Searched for the Bigfoot said <br/>
to inhabit the Hockomock Swamp, and tons of haunted spots)While <br/>
looking into info about the infamous RI vampire "Nelly Brown" I <br/>
stumbled across the clues for her letterbox and was so excited. I E-<br/>
mailed Lori the link to the main site , her response was "This is so <br/>
cool ! " We've been hooked since and there is nothing we enjoy more!!<br/>
All I can say is "Thank you all ! " <br/>

<br/>
Our introduction to letterboxing is a little different<br/>
from most. <br/>
<br/>
Back in college, I was very close friends with someone<br/>
who had moved away to Louisiana and had disappeared<br/>
from my life. I knew she had gotten married, but I<br/>
didn't know her new husband's last name.<br/>
<br/>
As I'm sure happens to all of us, I got a spam from<br/>
Classmates.com. I was already signed up, but decided<br/>
on a whim to see if anyone new had signed up for my<br/>
school. So I started tossing random names into the<br/>
search bar, to check up on old friends. Again, on a<br/>
whim, I threw her name into it.<br/>
<br/>
Damn if she wasn't in the database! A quick search<br/>
through yahoo turned up her email, and by the end of<br/>
the night, we were talking on the phone for the first<br/>
time in years and years!<br/>
<br/>
During that first conversation, she told us about the<br/>
letterboxing site. After we hung up, we jumped online,<br/>
and the site hooked us hard! Within two weeks, we had<br/>
a stamp, and our first finds were Buckaroo's boxes at<br/>
Petticoat Hill in MA. <br/>

<br/>
I first heard about letterboxing in a weblog I read semi-regularly.  <br/>
After checking out the letterboxing.org site, I was a bit <br/>
disappointed because there were so few boxes in Michigan, and only 3 <br/>
anywhere near me (an hour away).  I thought about it for a couple of <br/>
weeks and then on a weekend trip to Chicago, we found our first 2 <br/>
boxes -- Matt the Ratt's Chicago Underground and Magic Hedge boxes.  <br/>
It was fate...  had it not been raining, we probably wouldn't have <br/>
taken time while there to look for the boxes, but since the <br/>
Underground box provided a reprieve from the rain, it fit into the <br/>
agenda.  The rest, as they say, is history...  and hopefully others <br/>
over here on the west side of Michigan won't be so disappointed by <br/>
lack of boxes as I initially was.<br/>

Well, the bandwagon is getting full, so I thought I would jump on before
there is no more room ! I read about letterboxing in the Smithsonian years
ago and could not get my hiking buddies interested. So we just continued
hiking the blue trails. I was gifted a book on Nature Preserves and began
hiking those too. One I liked the name of was Milo Light but my hikers did
not want to drive to Salem !! Like What is in Salem ?? No Blue trails! Then
by chance I met Bonnie [now Lobsta Lady] who practically lives in Milo Light.
We walked it one day and found the map I had was not complete. Bonnie got
on line looking for a new map of Milo Light and pop!! there was a Drew Clue
Sheet for a letterbox at Milo. I was so excited and off we went, found the
box and stamped our thumbs. That imprint never diminished and grew to almost
take over our lives. <span class="moz-smiley-s3"><span> ;-) </span></span> So
like many, we have Jay to thank, so Thanks Jay !!<br/>

<pre wrap="">Wow! We've loved reading all the different answers to this one. Like 
Dan and Melissa, we found out about it from our local Eastern

spend time while the teens linger endlessly over 3 different pairs of 
boots that look EXACTLY the same...

EMS's manager, Eric The Ram, and before him Sarah, are avid 
letterboxers and have files of unpublished boxes that are well worth 
a trip. The only problem is all those pretty kayaks tempting my 
paycheck...

Great string!

&gt; My wife Lori , myself and my son Ryan, had always had an interest in<br/>
&gt; some of the stranger places and things to be found here in New England<br/>
&gt; (The Stone Knight, Americas Stonehenge,<br/>
<br/>
Boy do I have a box for you ... :)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Jay in oh-it's-not-time-to-shovel-again-is-it CT<br/>
<br/>
I've shoveled 3 times already (about 18-24 inches), and its still <br/>
here :-)  They're saying 4 more inches.  Good luck with it ... and <br/>
good luck to anyone who thinks they're gonna find good woods hiding <br/>
places in the mid atlantic for a while ...<br/>
<br/>
I found out about letterboxing when Mitch (Der Mad Stamper) spammed<br/>
rec.sport.orienteering in spring '98 (which is also how I found out<br/>
about geocaching, when Dave Ulmer spammed the same ng spring '00).<br/>
<br/>
I had had similar yearnings about an activity along these lines when<br/>
I was kicking around Mackinac Island a long time ago ('88), and spent <br/>
a day on that island with a tourist map trying to figure out how it <br/>
would work, but never got the ideas to congeal, so I jumped in when I <br/>
found people were actually doing this (hint to those of you who like <br/>
my mystery boxes, a special mapsurfer box is slated for that island).  <br/>
My ideas were more along the ideas of "mystery boxes for people who <br/>
like maps and like to move around the country", which I guess explains <br/>
why that is mostly what I do, and why I had the first mystery boxes <br/>
listed on the web site.<br/>
<br/>
By the end of '98 I was P1F1, but was working lots of ideas on paper<br/>
which eventually would become boxes, as I found time to get to the places<br/>
that worked with the ideas.<br/>
<br/>
In the early days I was involved with the web site; letterboxing.org<br/>
was registered oct '98.  It was hosted on mapsurfer.com and redirected<br/>
first to Dan's site, then to the original LbNA site on Mitch's AOL<br/>
account. I had to modify the source code of the web server to get the<br/>
redirect to work right in all cases -- and it certainly didn't work great<br/>
in any case.  I guess some people around here remember that.<br/>
<br/>
I learned about the EMS Waterford operation from Ray Hassans (creator<br/>
of "Ray's Dilemma") and went up there spring '99.  They had 9 clues<br/>
in the store at the time, 8 in CT, one in RI, including their original<br/>
clue ("Elaine and Jerry's Bluff") and the infamous "Ray's Dilemma".<br/>
I found 7 of the 9, and thought I was in the right place for Ray's<br/>
(quite an achievement for an out-of-towner, I thought at the time,<br/>
with no laptop or search engines), but came up empty.  I got permission<br/>
from the EMS folks to post those 9 clues on letterboxing.org, and they<br/>
said I could post the web address on their board and in their logbooks.<br/>
(In those days they had a board outside the store where people stamped<br/>
their sig stamp -- I stamped it -- I wonder if it is still there -- <br/>
I wonder how many others who stamped it back then are still in the<br/>
hobby).<br/>
<br/>
There were enough boxes popping up, especially in the CT scene, that<br/>
I decided to try for F100 by the end of '99.  I had to go out to Door<br/>
County WI (which I believe at one point in letterboxing history had<br/>
more boxes than any other county in the country).  Since I like moving<br/>
about the country, it was a good fit.  "Mink River" from WI remains<br/>
my favorite box I've found.<br/>
<br/>
By the end of '99, I was P22F100.  F100 was a Drewclan box in North<br/>
Stonington (?), CT.  I also spent a good part of '99 trying to implement<br/>
some of the ideas I had (some from when I was quite young), <br/>
mapsurfer #3, #9, #14, and #17 seem to be the ones I'm most pleased<br/>
with from that era.<br/>
<br/>
I remember Jay Drew's first series, "Feather in your Cap".  That was<br/>
a long hike in a beautiful area.  Are they still intact? :-)<br/>
<br/>
I could write about history forever, but I'll spare the audience :-)<br/>
Since then, I've tried to work some more of my ideas and keep trying<br/>
new stuff, for better or for worse.  Its also been interesting to see<br/>
over the years all the different people come in, with different backgrounds<br/>
and different interests, and hence different styles of boxes ...<br/>
<br/>

thought it timely to join in the chatter.....<br/>
<br/>
My husband, after learning about LB'ing from the EMS website, <br/>
mentioned the concept to me.  I rolled my eyes and thought who would <br/>
go out in search of a plastic container from some clues that <br/>
some "joe-shmoe" posted on the net!  Ok, well after months passed, it <br/>
did pique my curiousity.  As we were heading down to the CT shore <br/>
towns for a long Presidents' weekend, I decided to print some clues <br/>
and see if these boxes were for real.  Well, Meig's Point was our <br/>
first find (and hit upon a hitchhiker to boot!!!). Our school age <br/>
daughter thought it was really neat!  Of course, we got hooked and <br/>
are happy to report: F=117; P=6 (two more awaiting Spring!) and X=63.<br/>
<br/>
Over the year we have enjoyed hiking, biking, kayaking and X-country <br/>
skiing to  many of our finds.  So many places we would not have known <br/>
about if it weren't for this great hobby!  Then again, many places we <br/>
visited all the time; but now have an added bonus of a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Our daughter was so hooked on it that for her birthday party last <br/>
year, we introduced her friends to none other than a "letterboxing" <br/>
adventure!  The girls were thrilled when they found all the boxes; <br/>
thus getting their families involved now.  So the cycle goes on and <br/>
CT flourishes in the land of plenty.<br/>
   Happy Trails to all!<br/>

<div>We are planning to take a trip to Southern Oregon 
this summer and I was looking for information about hiking in the area.  
Google returned a link to the LBNA site.  It sounded really cool and, like 
everyone else, finding the first box meant I was hooked.  I need to slow 
down my finds, however, or I will burn through the relatively few boxes here in 
Southern California.</div>

That's what did it for me too, the Post article.  I hauled my children out after the Get In The Game box and that was it for us, totally addiction.  I love finding and I love carving and hiding and any excuse to take me outside into the quiet wood.  My older son, Heron, loves that final moment of victory in finding the boxes and seeing the stamps of people who've found ours.  Mother of Crickets<br/>

I love carving and printmaking and discovered letterboxing while looking<br/>
at hand carved stamps on the internet.  It seemed like just my sort of<br/>
thing, since I have often made clued treasure hunts for family and friends<br/>
as a way of "wrapping" a gift.  Letterboxing blends three of my favorite<br/>
things perfectly -- art, puzzles and the outdoors.<br/>

i read about letterboxing when the smithsonian article<br/>
first came out (i actually had a subscription then!)<br/>
and thought it was really neat, but filed the info as<br/>
random cool useless information. i saw an article in<br/>
my local paper this past summer ("nifty things to keep<br/>
the kids busy while out of school" series,) and have<br/>
been hooked since. as for publicity, if it werent for<br/>
the newspaper i wouldn't have heard of the sport<br/>
again, so the occasional SMALL blurb is nice, but i<br/>
dont think we wanna see the sport picked up by<br/>
mcdonalds or the home-and-garden network, so<br/>
less-is-more. <br/>
heading for dc this weekend, hoping i can get to the<br/>
smithsonial castle despite the snow, i reeeeeealy<br/>
wanna get that stamp before it dissapears. <br/>
good luck to all<br/>

<br/>No problem with the Smithsonian!  Orion, Egypt Explorer and Year of the Ram will be easy.  The other boxes in the area will be a challange.  Where are you coming from Spike?  If you are coming from MD, Newbe1 and I are meeting in College Park in the a.m. to exchange, if you would like to join us.
