<div>Yet another question from the newbie!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was wondering about the size of log books that 
letterboxers use for their personal books (i.e. the book that you keep and stamp 
in all the boxes you find).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The reason I am wondering is that I was thinking 
about stamps of items that are really long (like a ship) or really tall (like a 
building or tree).  Is there a recommended limit on the size of a 
stamp?  I wouldn't want to make a stamp that wouldn't fit in someone's 
book.</div>

<div>Eric, I think size matters even in stamps and 
books. We just planted a stamp that I thought was pretty large. It was 2 1/2" X 
4". Normally I try to keep stamps smaller than that. We carry a "stamp in" book 
that is 7" X 5 1/2". Some folks have a 3 ring binder 8 1/2" X 11" and carry 
sheets with them on the trail.. We have a two part personal stamp in case we run 
across a micro box, plus we like to do a two color stamp in when we can. Stamps 
are personal preference------there are no rules. Don</div>

Folks willl find a way to make it fit in their logbooks. They might <br/>
have to stretch it over two pages or something like that. <br/>

I used to carve smaller stamps, but I find that I keep getting bigger <br/>
and bigger. :-) But the boxes I hide them in have gotten smaller and <br/>
smaller. <br/>

I ran across  "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" letterbox .<br/>
The headless horseman stamp was carved on a 1/4 inch thick piece of pink<br/>
Speedball material ,and mounted on a thin piece of wood.<br/>
The stamp size was 6 X 4 inches and very difficult to find a flat,solid<br/>
surface large enough to obtain a good stamp image.<br/>
I ended up walking out of the woods ,and  back to my truck and using the<br/>
truck hood to get a  large enough surface to stamp on .<br/>
After 3 tries I got a beautiful stamp.<br/>
IMHO....keep 'em kinda small !!<br/>

my 'letterbox creation kit' I have just in case I get inspired along <br/>
the way.  These cluesheets are sorted by state and then by region.  <br/>
I include a trail map from any parks in which the boxes might be (in <br/>
the event I have a map on hand or have found a map on the internet <br/>
for that region).  <br/>
     When we went to Cincinatti last Nov, I found that using the <br/>
rental car map of the region that we got to plot where the <br/>
letterboxes were located helped us quite a bit in the 'efficiency' <br/>
of trying to tackle several boxes throughout the city in a very <br/>
limited amount of time.  Now, I'm trying to collect rental car maps <br/>
of major cities in which I might look for letterboxes in the future <br/>
(it sure beats drawing the maps by hand--which is what my sister <br/>
does--but she's an artist).  It was the perfect size for including <br/>
in my notebook (3 ring binder--folded in half) and really helped <br/>
seeing at a glance where &amp; the quantity of boxes in certain regions <br/>
around the city.  Now, if only I had enough freetime to go out <br/>
boxing again...  :(<br/>
