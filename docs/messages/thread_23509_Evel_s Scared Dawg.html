I wanted to let the placers of "Evel's Scared Dawg - LbNA #9856" <br/>
letterbox in Twin Falls, Idaho know that the box is missing. <br/>
<br/>
It was a great place to bring my grandchildren for a visit while I'm <br/>
out visiting from Massachusetts...so all was not a wash. ;-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I haven't looked for a while, but wasn't that one of Don and Gwen's?  I know<br/>
they had one or two in Twin and I heard one was missing.  If it is Don and<br/>
Gwen they are currently on a high mountain in Montana and may not be<br/>
checking the list for a while.  I spoke with them tonight and they are<br/>
enjoying the sights of Missoula as I write.  I don't think they will really<br/>
be home until Sept.  So I'm guessing the big list won't work.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I could get on and look to see if it was theirs, but I am soooooo<br/>
tired at the moment!  Maybe another time.<br/>
