&gt; It would seem that the geocache site was also infected?  I had <br/>
&gt; looked at it this morning after noticing the change on the <br/>
&gt; letterboxing site, but the geocache site looked normal.<br/>
<br/>
Gee, so what was the problem??<br/>
<br/>
I agree, I was sorry that everything was taken down before I had a <br/>
chance to look at it! I guess geocachers don't really have a sense of <br/>
humor.  And so what was the problem with the geocachers?? Why were <br/>
they looking at Letterboxing dot org anyway? It's a good thing <br/>
letterboxers can take a joke! :-)<br/>
