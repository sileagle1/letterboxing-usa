                    <html><body>We were looking for The Compass Letterbox yesterday at Stanley Park in Westfield, MA and we ended up chatting with the groundskeeper...He told us that he found a tupperware container with a few items in it that had "geocache" written on it...<br/>
He didn't know what to do with it, so it's new home is the "Lost and Found" Department at Stanley Park. Just thought you geo's out there would like to know....<br/>
<br/>
By the way, has anyone ever tried this box yet? It's my first at using a compass, and was wondering if I am doing it right.....<br/>
