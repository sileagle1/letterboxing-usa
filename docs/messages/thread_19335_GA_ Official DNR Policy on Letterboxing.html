of <br/>
you who will find the humor in this document. I received this in <br/>
response to a letter I wrote to the Georgia DNR. It seems that when <br/>
they (VERY recently) updated their policy they copied most of it <br/>
directly from their orienteering policy, a hobby with which they <br/>
appear to be much more familiar.<br/>
<br/>
I've saved the full document in the files section of<br/>
letterbox-usa <br/>
and letterbox-southeast (filename GDNR Policy). What appears below is <br/>
cut directly from the letter. Maybe there are some of you who have <br/>
successfully contacted the "Powers That Be" in your home<br/>
state and <br/>
can give me some tips as to how I should proceed from here. <br/>

"June 30, 2004<br/>
Dear Mr. [Red],<br/>
     Georgia State Parks and Historic Sites treats the activity of <br/>
letterboxing similarly to geocaching and orienteering. Letterboxing <br/>
is permitted under limited circumstances, on our sites. I am <br/>
attaching our current policy.<br/>
     Thanks for your interest in Georgia State Parks and Historic <br/>
Sites. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact <br/>
me at 404-656-6524.<br/>
     Sincerely,<br/>
     Larry [name withheld]<br/>
     Program Manager<br/>

Non Traditional Activities  Updated 6/30/04<br/>
<br/>
Geocaching and Letterboxing --- Activities in which participants use <br/>
a GPS to locate a predetermined location in unfamiliar territory. In <br/>
geocaching, a geocache is placed at the GPS coordinate location for <br/>
the participant to find. The geocache is kind of a treasure box where <br/>
the participants can log-in that they have found the geocache and so <br/>
they can exchange novelty type items. In letterboxing, a letterbox is <br/>
placed at the GPS location for the participant to find. The letterbox <br/>
is kind of a treasure box where the participants can log-in that they <br/>
have found the letterbox, collect the letterbox stamp and so they can <br/>
exchange novelty type items.<br/>
<br/>
Geocaching and Letterboxing is permitted on our State Parks and <br/>
Historic Sites under the following conditions to be determined by <br/>
manager's discretion.<br/>
1.That the site has the land base and has an area suitable for <br/>
geocaching or letterboxing. This location will be safe for the <br/>
participants and/or spectators.<br/>
2. Any geocaching or letterboxing activity cannot be located on a <br/>
site or in an area that would damage the natural resource.<br/>
4. The site manager determines if geocaching or letterboxing is an <br/>
appropriate activity that fits the sites interpretive goals.<br/>
<br/>
Geocaching and Letterboxing can be held our State Parks and Historic <br/>
Sites in the following two circumstances:<br/>
1.The park or historic site establishes and maintains a geocache or <br/>
letterbox for its guests to find.<br/>
2. The park or historic site can allow outside groups to establish a <br/>
temporary geocaching course or a temporary letterbox course for guest <br/>
to use on a limited basis. The group establishing the geocaching <br/>
course or the letterbox course is responsible for inspecting the <br/>
premises including the course itself to insure no unusual hazards <br/>
exists. The park will provide someone to accompany the group <br/>
inspecting the premises and the course itself.<br/>
3. No park or historic site will allow unsecured outdoor geocache <br/>
(treasure box) or an unsecured letterbox (treasure box) except for <br/>
very limited times for weekend geocaching or letterboxing events. <br/>
Parks or historic sites should have the markers for there site <br/>
sponsored geocache or letterbox locations that would give a <br/>
combination to open the treasure box, which should be maintained at a <br/>
park office or interpretive center. The park staff would not have to <br/>
open and to close the geocache or the letterbox, but the guest could <br/>
use the combination lock to have access and to trade their novelty <br/>
items. Park staff should inspect geocaches or letterboxes <br/>
periodically to insure no inappropriate items are left in the <br/>
geocache or the letterbox.<br/>
4. Geocaches or Letterboxes on Georgia State Parks and Historic Sites <br/>
will not allow any items that violate any park rules, policies, <br/>
regulations or state laws. Furthermore inappropriate items for <br/>
children such as weapons, sharp objects, lighters, matches etc. will <br/>
not be allowed. Additionally, food or drink items will not be <br/>
permitted in geocaches or letterboxes.<br/>
5. Due to insurance and indemnity issues, outside groups sponsoring <br/>
geocaching or letterboxing events that charges any type of fee will <br/>
be required to have a concession agreement with the department. The <br/>
concession agreement will require the outside group to have insurance.<br/>
6. Outside groups that charge participants of an geocaching or <br/>
letterboxing event will be required to pay a fee to the<br/>
department."<br/>
<br/>
Well, if you've read this far I hope you've got some good<br/>
ideas for <br/>
me.<br/>

They are obviously not fully informed about what letterboxing is, and<br/>
you could be the person to set them straight. I would go through the<br/>
document point by point and explain, in a friendly and open manner,<br/>
what the inaccuracies are. I would stress, that for letterboxers at<br/>
least, the activity is predicated on a "leave-no-trace" ethic. Lastly,<br/>
I would offer to meet with them (or speak with them on the phone) to<br/>
go over any questions they might have.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to be infomative, honest, friendly, and non-combative.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

insurance policy onfile with the Parks department just in case.<br/>
<br/>
Now about not leaving weapons in the treasure boxes...I can tell this <br/>
isn't Texas! How about exploding ones?<br/>
<br/>
Glad that the letterboxing sites are going to be well-marked and <br/>
labelled. I would hate to think that folks would have to hunt for <br/>
them. At least Park employees will not have to unlock them for <br/>
others. Strangely enough, that does give one some neat ideas about <br/>
locking letterboxes. 'Nuff said, as Stan Lee might opine.<br/>
<br/>
I agree. You need to talk with these folks and calmly explain some <br/>
things. Then it will be up to you as to whether or not you follow <br/>
their rules. Of course not following the rules might reflect badly <br/>
upon the American Federation of Letterboxers, Inc. (Whoops, not <br/>
supposed to tell you about that or their secret handshakes. Sorry.)<br/>
<br/>
DNR means "Do Not Resuscitate" in my neck of the woods. I know <br/>
because I carry such an instruction.<br/>
