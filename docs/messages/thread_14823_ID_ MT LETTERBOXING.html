<br/>
you were great too!  I'm glad I came down.  Thanks for the new boxes!!!!!!<br/>
I wrote about meeting you too if you look back in the posts. (If you're<br/>
interested.)<br/>
<br/>
I just had a realization.  When I started this year, there were still just a<br/>
handfull of boxes in ID, now thanks to dilligent effort, there are 68 that I<br/>
know of with more coming!  That blows me away.  Now granted, our state is a<br/>
little bit bigger than many of the eastern ones, so it's still spread out,<br/>
but it is still so fun to see the growth in a limited time.  I think I can<br/>
speak for A and J Bear when I say we love you traveling boxers.  It's nice<br/>
to find boxes from someone other than the other person that has planted most<br/>
of my finds (although I love Aryn's boxes).  Now if we could just get a few<br/>
others as addicted as we are . . .   How fun, and a little scary.  It's a<br/>
little fun being unique too.  I don't want this to become a fad that begins<br/>
to disregard the environmental factors of planting and finding, but it will<br/>
be fun to have some other boxers in this half of the state.  We'll see what<br/>
happens with the Paisley Orca's relatives.<br/>
<br/>
till later,<br/>

<br/>
Hey All!<br/>
<br/>
Had a family reunion to attend during vacation and letterboxing was a<br/>
part of it!  Cadenza of Idaho Falls made my day by showing up at the<br/>
park where our gathering was at!  It was terrific! John and I exchanged<br/>
stamps with her and talked letterboxing.  She's way cool!<br/>
<br/>
We had nabbed Heather's Road Trip LB at Deadman's Pass, I'm happy to say<br/>
on the way.  Only because it was a necessary stop, though.  Luckily, it<br/>
was quite dark, so we didn't have as much trouble with discretion as it<br/>
sounds like Funhog had.<br/>
<br/>
A few days later we managed to find some letterboxes in Idaho.  I also<br/>
placed a couple in Idaho and one in Montana and the clues should be<br/>
available now.  They are Smiley Spud, Mt. Borah Trailhead, and Big Sky<br/>
Bison.  <br/>
<br/>
The fantastic LB's we got in Idaho are:  Mr. Potato Head, Spirit of the<br/>
West, Idaho Falls, Gotta Go, Flying Free, the entire Eagle Rock series,<br/>
Early Hunters, and the Last of the Elephants (Can't believe we were the<br/>
first to stamp into this one.  What a perfect escape on a very hot day,<br/>
too!)  Once again, letterboxing showed me things I never knew were<br/>
there.  <br/>
<br/>
The only thing I've ever done in Idaho Falls previously is visit and<br/>
eat, but this time we got to see what a nice little city it truly is!<br/>
Cadenza's Eagle Rock series is the perfect tour for a tourist wanting to<br/>
check out the beauty of Idaho Falls.  Right in town, too!  With some of<br/>
the others very close by!<br/>
<br/>
There were more boxes to get, but we either ran out of time, didn't have<br/>
the clues with us, or weren't in the right areas at the right time, so<br/>
some had to be by-passed (DARN!)<br/>
<br/>
So...get ye all to Idaho for nothing else but the letterboxes for sure!<br/>
Cadenza and Aryn and Jason have sprinkled the area with their art, as<br/>
well as some by visiting Heather and Don and Gwen.  Now you can add me<br/>
to the count, as well!<br/>
<br/>
Fun trip.  So glad I was able to get at least a few letterboxes.  I also<br/>
explained letterboxing to some of my relatives who live in Idaho and<br/>
even took one of them to get Mr. Potato Head with us.  We're hoping she<br/>
and her family will be getting involved.  I made them each a signature<br/>
stamp to get started, so we'll see!  By the way, my poor little boxes<br/>
are orphans, so if someone kindly would like to babysit them now and<br/>
then it would be most appreciated.  THANKS!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
