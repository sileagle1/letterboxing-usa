                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a little update. I have decided to forego the stamp carving <br/>
tutorial/demo as I am concerned about giving people enough time to <br/>
box and enjoy Highland Forest. Winter boxing takes a little more <br/>
time...unless you are on x-country skis! As this is an indoor event, <br/>
there IS a definate stop time. It's not like we can hang out there <br/>
into the wee hours. (Although I am checking out Apres Boxing meeting <br/>
spots!) <br/>
<br/>
The other reason that I am skipping the demo is that the letterboxing <br/>
will have a little twist. We will be playing Letterboxing Bingo <br/>
(generously shared by Mowizliz). Each of you will be given a large <br/>
Bingo card and clue booklet when you arrive and sign into the Event <br/>
Book. You will have to collect the stamps listed in each square, <br/>
which will include my stamps, donated stamps from around the country, <br/>
personal travelers, and the Event Stamp will be the center stamp. The <br/>
person who completes the MOST rows will win the Grand Prize...a $50 <br/>
ExxonMobil Gift Card! In case of a tie there will be a drawing. <br/>
Everyone who completes at least TWO rows (usually 5 or 6 stamps plus <br/>
a few personal travelers) will win a prize. You are under NO <br/>
obligation to take part in the Bingo game. You may box in the <br/>
traditional way at your own pace or do both...stamp into your book as <br/>
well as the card. This is just a fun twist to our hobby. <br/>
<br/>
Raffle tickets will be on sale or you may make a donation if you are <br/>
not interested in the prizes. Several people have asked me about the <br/>
$2 a car charge. There is a "suggested" donation of $2 that you <br/>
usually drop in the box inside Skyline Lodge...but it costs you <br/>
nothing to enter and use Highland Forest or to park your car. It is <br/>
my hope that we raise enough funds from the raffle to cover the room <br/>
rental and everyone's "suggested" donation. If you have raffle prizes <br/>
you would like to donate..just contact me personally and we can make <br/>
the arrangements. <br/>
<br/>
Can you tell I am getting excited about this event? *grin*<br/>

Wanda and Pete are definitely VIPS who are more than willing to share some good wintering tips.<br/>
<br/>
What else could a LBoxer share with just the right person for a yippy good time on a cross-country trail? <br/>
