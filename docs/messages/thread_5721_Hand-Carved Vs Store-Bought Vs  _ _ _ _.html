My dad, who is getting into the letterboxing thing as an activity to do with <br/>
his daughter (Isn't that neat?), doesn't plan to carve a stamp at this time.  <br/>
But he is a self-taught cartoonist and plans to draw a caricature in the log <br/>
when he finds a box.  At first I was bummed -- I mean, he is perfectly <br/>
capable of carving a stamp (or buying one).  But after thinking about it, I <br/>
realized that anyone would be tickled to get one of his clever cartoons in <br/>
their log book.   And, his drawings ARE his personal stamp.  So, there are <br/>
always exceptions to the rule, and perhaps the meaning of "personal stamp" <br/>
can be more loosely interpreted.<br/>

...and a THIRD thought.  In Dartmoor, hand carved stamps don't seem to be<br/>
the norm.  Custom stamps can be made with any design you choose.  Try your<br/>
local stationary or office supply store.  My first box has a stamp I<br/>
designed and had made.  It costs a little more (mine was about $15), but for<br/>
your personal stamp, it might be a good solution.<br/>

the same price or cheaper than store-bought stamps (many of the medium-sized ones I've made have <br/>
only been $6-8 each).  If you look in your yellow pages, or on the internet, you can find many places <br/>
that make stamps very quickly and cheaply. If anyone would like a recommendation of a good place to <br/>
send custom stamps, write to me off list.<br/>
<br/>
If you draw your design at a larger size, then xerox it at 50% or scan it into a computer to reduce it, <br/>
you'll get a better-looking image. A custom stamp can be made from a xeroxed drawing, or at many <br/>
shops, straight from a computer image file.<br/>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Generally, for letterboxing I carve my own 
stamps.  However, for mailart &amp; other use, I design my own and have 
them made.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You can fit a LOT of images on a 7"x9" sheet of 
paper, and then cut up &amp; mount the rubber stamps when you get them back from 
the shop. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I do business with <a href="http://www.rubberstampit.com/custom.htm">http://www.rubberstampit.com/custom.htm</a> and 
I've been happy with them--and their prices--that generally undercut (so to 
speak) what you'll find at the office supply store counter, etc.  (No 
connection, I'm just a happy customer.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cheerfully,</div>
