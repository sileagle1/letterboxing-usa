Make a letterbook from a cigar box that is glued inside the boards <br/>
and binding of a very large encyclopedia from which the pages are <br/>
entirely removed. This provides plenty of room for a sizable stamp <br/>
and book. It essentially has a double lid -- the cover of the book, <br/>
and the lid of the cigar box. The bottom of the cigar box is the only <br/>
section glued to the back book board. <br/>
<br/>
You can buy a hollow book on eBay, like this one: <br/>
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?<br/>
ViewItem&amp;category=100&amp;item=6191416711&amp;rd=1&amp;ssPageName=WDVW<br/>
Searching for "book safe" also brings up a lot of hits.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sue and I recently planted a box such as this. It was very easy to carve through the pages. We just made a template of the size opening we needed on some binders board and held it over the pages. We then x-acto'd our way through as many pages as we could, moved the template to the next group of pages and so on. Our stamp and logbook are such that they fit the opening. Even included a cat's eye stamp pad in the allotted space. <br/>
<br/>
Hint: choose a thick book with thin paper. Makes all the difference!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Recently I was browsing a craft store... one of the major ones - Michael's or AC Moore, I do believe - ... and I saw in the unfinished wooden crafts area a box made to look like a bound book. If I see one again I'll repost. Anyway, it was obviously made to be a hide-away chest for "valuables" or a secret stash of some kind.  You'd just have to paint the carved binding to look like a real book.  Can't remember the cost but those places often have 30-50% off in sales or coupons.  The space inside was great and it could be latched with hardware.  A small hasp would make it lockable if you need that option in a retail location<br/>
<br/>
My most favorite creative letterbox that I've seen to date was the Gollum LB ("My Precioussssss" I think) at the store during the MMM in CT.  Exquisitely done. <br/>

  There is limited space inside a hollowed book, which is disappointing <br/>
  after all the drudgery with an x-acto knife. <br/>
