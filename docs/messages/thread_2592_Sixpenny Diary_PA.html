French Creek SP.<br/>

Unfortunately we came up empty handed.  We followed the the story of<br/>
Kevin &amp; Donna to the letter but became clearly stumped by the extremely<br/>
vague (nearby rock).  If you've ever been there you would know that<br/>
there are a billion rocks in the area.  ={  If anyone would be willing<br/>
to give the tinniest of clues to Donna's Diary we would be truly<br/>
grateful.<br/>

two weekends<br/>
