Stamp (very good if I do say so myself ha ha) lol kidding<br/>
Clues Easy I feel only not quite flowing together so that it is a little more<br/>
challenging.<br/>
Area High traffic so watch who is watching you.<br/>
<br/>
To find the letterbox:<br/>
Find SE Morrison &amp; the Willamette<br/>
The KOIN Tower is at 225 degrees and the Big Pink is at 300 degrees Beneath the<br/>
ribbed steel<br/>
Have a seat to take the read and feel free to take a reach to your right...no<br/>
one will be the wiser.<br/>
Above you over your left shoulder you will see the number five.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone thinks this is a location that has too much traffic let me know and I<br/>
will relocate it. <br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
