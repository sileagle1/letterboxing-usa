Fort Halifax is located at the juncture of the Sebasticook and Kennebec <br/>
rivers in Winslow, Maine. This fort was the most important inland fort in all <br/>
of New England during the French and Indian War, because it was built to <br/>
protect the 3 main routes to the Colonies from the British. The only <br/>
remaining structure still standing is the nation's oldest wooden blockhouse <br/>
of its type. In 1987, the floodwaters of the Kennebec swept the blockhouse <br/>
down river. Pieces were recovered and the structure was reconstructed as it <br/>
stands today.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
On Rte. 201 on Bay St park in the dirt parking lot next to J &amp; S Oil. <br/>
Go through the entrance to the park at the large boulder. Fort Halifax will <br/>
be on your left.<br/>
Proceed to where one might have drawn water from the mighty Sebasticook River<br/>
…….<br/>
In the center of the park you will spot twin sisters that might have been <br/>
here at the time of the construction of the fort. Walk to this place for a <br/>
better view of the Kennebec River, which flows to the Atlantic Ocean. </div>
