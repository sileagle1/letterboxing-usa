2nd in the Camelot Series<br/>

Follow the path of Gold. Be watchful for a path of Green merging from the left. Follow this connecting trail.<br/>
On this trail looking forward will show you green, looking back will show you gold. It is a seldom traveled<br/>
path though grassy vales. Nearing the end of the trail you will see the cliffs ahead. Turn to the left on the<br/>
green trail proper, counting off 13 healthy paces (two footfalls). Look up the rockface. See the place where<br/>
graffitti has been covered with dull brown paint. This is your destination. Climb carefully mindful of the<br/>
many holes between boulders.<br/>
<br/>
Upon reaching the crevase which contains the cave opening, you will see what appears to be a throne naturally<br/>
formed in the rockface left of the opening. There is a small flat place to stand next to it. From here, notice<br/>
the sumac tree at a bearing of 175 degrees. Merlin hides under rocks at its base. Carefully replace the rocks<br/>
so that they appear natural and the box is well hidden (no peeking corners). The youth of the area sometimes<br/>
come to make patronage to the great wizard.<br/>
