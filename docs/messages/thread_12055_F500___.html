Congratulations on reaching F500.  We have been wondering <br/>
when someone from the west coast would reach that milestone.  <br/>
Do you want your name added to the PFX 500 club on our web <br/>
page?  If so, what date would you like us to use?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">WOW! I guess you can tell WE'RE really out of the loop!!! That last  <br/>
was a message I had asked Pete to write a week or so ago, and finally <br/>
reminded him about again this morning, probably when he was still half <br/>
asleep! Anyway, it's pretty obvious he doesn't read the talk list much <br/>
either, or he would have immediately seen - as I did when I just <br/>
stopped in, "between boxes", at the Simsbury Library in CT to check <br/>
for anything new - and now find that we have another West Coast <br/>
letterboxing party, dvn2r ckrs, to congratulate on also reaching <br/>
F500!!!(and we were so proud of them for finding our Polish mystery <br/>
box, too!!!) So, can we add your names to the 500 Club list, too? <br/>
Hurrahs for you all!<br/>
<br/>
Wanda from RI<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Congrats to others reaching their personal milestones, too!<br/>
Sorry we just can't keep up with everything, and that includes <br/>
notifying folks when we find their hitchers! I try to get them back <br/>
out quickly, and Pete usually posts to his tracking page, but then we <br/>
often forget about them, and they've been known to sit at our boxes <br/>
sometimes for months until someone else finally comes along and <br/>
reports finding them - like with "Swift Passage" and "Honda Road <br/>
Again" recently - but at least it's not US always reporting our finds, <br/>
or some folks might get REALLY annoyed and we wouldn't want that to <br/>
happen!!!;-)<br/>
