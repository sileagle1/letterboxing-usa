  We found the Blue Hills letterbox last week, but the cover is <br/>
cracked and the book is wet and mildewed. The stamp is still <br/>
there. We had no replacement materials, so we replaced as <br/>
was.<br/>
  Also found City Lights which was just fine. A camp group from <br/>
Moose Hill Audobon Camp had beat us to it earlier in the day.<br/>

</p><p>On the other hand (or hill), the Blue Hills Birthday letterbox (not to be confused with the Blue Hills letterbox) is in fine shape and is a really great walk/view.
