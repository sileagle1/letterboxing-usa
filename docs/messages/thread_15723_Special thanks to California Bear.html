                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got back from a looong and tiring business trip in LA.  I had <br/>
hoped to have Saturday free to get to the NoCal gathering, but I just <br/>
couldn't swing it.  Fortunately, the trip was made perfectly <br/>
delightful by meeting Eric (California Bear) for an afternoon of <br/>
boxing in the Long Beach area!  He took me to El Dorado regional park <br/>
where we got six of the seven boxes there, and had to explain to a <br/>
homeless gentleman what we were doing pulling a thing out of that <br/>
tree ... and we also visited Santa Fe Springs to a lovely little <br/>
historic park for another three boxes.  Nine boxes total (which is my <br/>
record, and living where I do, it won't be broken any time soon!)<br/>
<br/>
Eric is very funny, and just plain fun to be with.  I felt like I'd <br/>
known him forever.  And, while I owe him a similarly wonderful day of <br/>
boxing in Colorado ... I definitely owed him a huge thank you for a <br/>
great afternoon.<br/>
