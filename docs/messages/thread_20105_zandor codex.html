A request was made of me to forward this to "letterboxing, geocaching, <br/>
and nostradamus groups".  (Apparently, it relates to all three of these <br/>
things).  I'm not into the latter 2; perhaps someone who is can move it <br/>
along, if they feel like propagating spam.  The only reason I'm doing it<br/>
is that I have actually seen this thing in a letterbox before, and feel like<br/>
defying the curse that accompanied it, that said, basically, that thou shall<br/>
not make it public (I suppose that is the reason I'm being asked to forward<br/>
it; the originator of this request must be afraid of said curse).<br/>

<br/>
Zandor Codex<br/>
<br/>
1.<br/>
COSTA RICA guides the white quetzal<br/>
While only singles and couples follow<br/>
The lascivious dogs cast by the side<br/>
Creator found in holly, hemlock and oak<br/>
<br/>
2.<br/>
The two white clad doctors work<br/>
Becomes known across the universe<br/>
The first for his fighting family<br/>
The second for his love of sweets<br/>
<br/>
3.<br/>
To vex the sumerians they come<br/>
The friends with the one glove<br/>
While the vile unctuous one<br/>
With magi and succubae cavorts<br/>
<br/>
4.<br/>
The twins in their prime arrive<br/>
Seven fingers on their hands<br/>
Great fame the younger finds<br/>
The elder for obscurity destined<br/>
<br/>
5.<br/>
Trouble between ister and rhenos<br/>
The savage traitor revealed<br/>
Where the seven seekers find<br/>
A future outside the walls<br/>
<br/>
6.<br/>
The janke cheats the dalmatian<br/>
For their children a great rivalry<br/>
Animals grand and small perish<br/>
Treasure unsplit and children joined<br/>
<br/>
7.<br/>
The singing astrologer's toy<br/>
Found there in the new city<br/>
Between the river and the lake<br/>
The lost city she seeks out<br/>
<br/>
8.<br/>
Demise of the snake gods<br/>
Has a silver lining<br/>
Clouds part to reveal<br/>
No beginning and no end<br/>
<br/>
9.<br/>
By treachery the king cast aside<br/>
Bishops and knights carry on<br/>
Though they be unable to speak<br/>
Iota beta and phi are intrigued<br/>
<br/>
10.<br/>
The horse tramples the dog<br/>
The friends join in memory<br/>
Their deed saved from obscurity<br/>
By the deeds of their child<br/>
<br/>
11.<br/>
The biologists share grave words<br/>
Fame for their charges spreads<br/>
The first yields not to trends<br/>
The second yields all control<br/>
<br/>
12.<br/>
Trouble in the chief city brews<br/>
Between blake and bailey it crawls<br/>
The white horse of the sixth<br/>
Does not find the way out<br/>
<br/>
13.<br/>
He follows the path of the snake<br/>
Forbidden green behind the wood<br/>
Not satisfied with discovered oil<br/>
While noblemen no longer follow<br/>
<br/>
14.<br/>
Gold in the sinking land<br/>
A great boon to the agile<br/>
Intrigue in the city of light<br/>
A missing link they find<br/>
<br/>
15.<br/>
The innocent are murdered<br/>
While the guilty go free<br/>
Eleven cries in the street<br/>
Broken land knows peace nevermore<br/>
<br/>
16.<br/>
The five brothers on the great lake<br/>
Under a waxing sun of destruction<br/>
A myth of law for the horrified<br/>
A fierce storm for their thoughts<br/>
<br/>
17.<br/>
The white clad doctor sweet<br/>
In rosh caught by spies<br/>
One from jail another free<br/>
A promising venture in ruin<br/>
<br/>
18.<br/>
