<br/>
After having neglected household chores for the last two "weekends" (which, <br/>
for us, is Monday and Tuesday), we took one day off, and today went to CT for <br/>
the first time. <br/>
<br/>
Our first stop was the Cute Clucker, a box originally put out for a fair in <br/>
2001 in Windsor, CT. After miscounting the trees once, we found the right <br/>
fallen log, and stamped in. The box is in excellent shape, though it hasn't <br/>
seen a lot of visitors since it's initial placement at the fair.<br/>
<br/>
Next up, East Windsor Intermediate School. This box was placed as a project <br/>
by a third grader to get classmates into letterboxing. In honor of the nature <br/>
of the box, we sent our four year old off to get it. The box is only a month <br/>
old, but has seen a goodly number of visitors, so the project is clearly <br/>
working!<br/>
