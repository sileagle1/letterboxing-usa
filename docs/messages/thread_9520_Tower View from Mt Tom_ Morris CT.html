TOM<br/><br/>Letterbox by Natalie &amp; Kaylee<br/>Placed Sept. 7, 2002<br/>Litchfield County, Connecticut (by Morris Connecticut)<br/>PLACE: Mt. Tom State Park<br/>Litchfield County, just past Morris on Rt 202 in Connecticut<br/><br/>Directions to Mt Tom:<br/>In Connecticut, take Route 8 (very scenic) to exit 42 (rt. 118)<br/>Follow 118 west toward Litchfield for 11 miles (16 minutes) (it actually turns into 202 along the way)...(past the town of Litchfield, Bantam &amp; Morris)...Right after You see the lake on the left, You will see a sign pointing to the left for Mt. Tom (veer left there)...<br/><br/><br/>ON THE WAY: <br/>have lunch in the historic town of Litchfield at the Aspen Garden Restaraunt, visit their very good historical museum, past the town, on the way to Mt. Tom, there are many nice antique shops, very *new englandy*...<br/><br/><br/>ONCE THERE:<br/>Take the tower trail to hike the well-worn rocky path to the top of Mt. Tom, to the old stone tower...climb the 3 flights of old wooden steps to see the most beautiful view of Connecticut...would be perfect for viewing fall foliage.<br/><br/>The box is hidden under the first step, inside, at the base of the tower (bottom floor).<br/><br/>This is a most enjoyable nature trail hike (not long) for most any age, the Park was a boyscout camp for over 70 years, it also has on the property a hamburger stand, swimming area with lifeguard, bathrooms &amp; changing rooms. *Have fun*<br/></p><p><br/></p><hr size="1"/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>
