<br/>
I visited the box on 22 Sep. and found it in excellent condition. However there were a number of freshly fallen trees across the trail although it was still usable at that time.<br/>
<br/>
Visited again on the 24th to try a bit of trail maintenance. The post Isabel storm had  dropped a few more trees. I bushwacked around two fresh groups and a new, but temporary, swamp. The box was still in great shape. <br/>
<br/>
At this time I consider the trail unusable for Letterboxing purposes. <br/>
<br/>
I will be scouting another trail as soon as possible for Fallen Tree Tail #2 or an alternate route to the first location. Then will make a decision on the first trail. After all we don't have a hurricane every year. <br/>
