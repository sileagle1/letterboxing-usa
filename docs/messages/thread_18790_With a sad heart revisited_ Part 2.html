This new software I'm now running at the website allows for something simply fantastic.  Individual themes!  Yes, you can select<br/>
from a set of existing themes and tailor the website to look as you want it, for you, not for everyone else.  Currently there are 19<br/>
different themes.  From techno based, to plain, to straightforward, to old world and more are being added as they are created.<br/>
<br/>
So, why lock yourself into what one person, or even one hundred people, think is the perfect looking website?  Tailor it to be as<br/>
individual as you are!  Like the Apple ad in the 80's, you can break free of the  Orwellian nightmare of tyranny and enslavement and<br/>
have your community look they way you want it to look!  Big Brother controls you no longer (chuckles softly)<br/>
<br/>
Come take a look, see what the future holds.<br/>

Steve, this is such fun - thank you! I played around switching themes<br/>
and finally decided upon "Pink Gooberhead" - which I am going to enjoy<br/>
IMMENSELY and I suspect very few other folks would pick;-)! <br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
