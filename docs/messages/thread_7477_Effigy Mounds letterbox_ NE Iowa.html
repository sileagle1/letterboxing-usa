Letterbox name:  Effigy Mounds Letterbox<br/>
Date places:  August 26, 2002<br/>
Nearest town: Marquette, Iowa<br/>
Effigy Mounds National Monument is open year 'round.  The hike is 4<br/>
miles total, moderate hiking conditions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A new letterbox has been hidden in a very special, sacred site.  It is<br/>
located along the Mississippi River in Effigy Mounds National Monument,<br/>
in northeast Iowa.  Entrance fee to Effigy Mounds is $2 (car load, good<br/>
for 7 days).  Get a map from the visitor center and get instructions on<br/>
how to get to the Marching Bears Mound Group in the South Unit of the<br/>
Park.  This is a remote, little traveled trail that will bring great<br/>
rewards.  Follow the trail to the Marching Bears (approx. 2 miles), some<br/>
steep terrain.  When you have reached the mound group, follow the mounds<br/>
along the backs of the bears (south/west) until you have reached the<br/>
second to last bear.  (If you reach the bird mounds, you went too far.)<br/>
There is an oak tree on the back of this second to last bear.  Take<br/>
approx. 13 steps from this tree westerly into the woods until you come<br/>
to a forked oak tree, in which one of the forks has broken off, leaving<br/>
a hollow stump.  The letterbox is inside this tree stump!  Happy<br/>
Hunting!<br/>
