Can we request an ownership transfer? The Fox Run Park is only a few miles from my house. I'd love to keep it in the list.<br/>

<br/>
I would be willing to be the custodian of "MD Orphan" boxes.   This is simply so any emails to the "owner" of those boxes could be sent to my email address and I could edit the boxes with updated information if anyone reports them found or damaged or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I would hate to lose the clues to any orphan boxes, but I certainly understand the chaos that having email go to the webmasters could cause.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you webmasters, for your dedication and help with our hobby.<br/>

&gt;How about creating a new owner with an email of someone willing<br/>
&gt;to be an adopted parent.  In other words, I would be willing to<br/>
&gt;adopt all Texas Abandoned boxes so would create an owner of<br/>
&gt;"TX Orphan" or something similar and put my email as the contact.<br/>
&gt;Who would I contact to transfer ownership to this newly created<br/>
&gt;owner?<br/>
