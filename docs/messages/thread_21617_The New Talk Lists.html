Seth, I totally agree. One of the (many) reasons why I don't like new<br/>
talk lists is also because most of them have gone the way of "forums"<br/>
where there are a million spin-off topics/threads/etc and it's just<br/>
way too much to wade through. I liked the old format - simple and to<br/>
the point.<br/>
<br/>
back to making logbooks,<br/>

I feel the same way and I made sure to register my complaint where it<br/>
says to "send feedback" of the new look on the home page for this<br/>
message board.  If enough people do that, maybe they will make some<br/>
changes.<br/>
