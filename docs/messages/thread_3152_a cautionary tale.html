                    <div class="plaintext-content">This past Saturday afternoon, my friend CZF was letterboxing in<br/>
Charlestown, RI,<br/>
with her three children.  Some public-spirited citizen, who apparently mistook<br/>
CZF's searching under bushes as the actions of a drunk or deranged person,<br/>
called the police.  Many more police showed up than one might imagine are<br/>
required to handle a 115-pound, legally blind mother of three.  Officers from<br/>
the Department of Environmental Management were even on hand to make sure she<br/>
wasn't doing something evil to the plant life.  It should be noted that<br/>
CZF was<br/>
letterboxing in a public area.<br/>
<br/>
CZF's attempts to explain about letterboxing were met with skepticism.<br/>
 She had<br/>
not yet located the box she was looking for and had placed her<br/>
letterboxing kit,<br/>
including her log book, under a bush.  Confused and flustered by the officers'<br/>
questions, and angered by their insinuations that she was "criminally<br/>
neglecting" her children, CZF was unable to find her kit to prove her story.<br/>
The police ran her driver's license and her plate and questioned her about her<br/>
Medic Alert ID.  Eventually they allowed her and her children to leave without<br/>
filing charges, but they sent three (3!) cruisers to follow her all the<br/>
way home<br/>
to Narragansett.<br/>
<br/>
CZF had to return the next day at 5am to find her letterboxing kit, and<br/>
to score<br/>
a hard-won stamp.<br/>
<br/>
While this example of extreme overkill on the part of local authorities may be<br/>
rare, letterboxers should be aware of how their actions may be perceived by<br/>
non-letterboxers.  Cell phones are now ubiquitous and allow people to report<br/>
vague suspicions as well as legitimate tips far easier than ever before.  I<br/>
would suggest that letterboxers should make sure to always carry ID, as<br/>
well as<br/>
a printout explaning what letterboxing is.  An adult companion might also be a<br/>
good idea -- the LbNA disclaimer notes that children should not letterbox<br/>
alone,<br/>
but mentions nothing about the trouble that adults can get into while<br/>
letterboxing with children!<br/>
<br/>
It's a sick world, people.  Stay on your toes.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>

I hope the trauma and humiliation of the event fades off<br/>
quickly, and CZF can someday find humor in such a<br/>
ridiculous situation. I also hope her children weren't<br/>
negatively affected.<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of the time I competed in a charity event<br/>
with an organization I belonged to. We competed as a<br/>
team in a city-wide scavenger hunt against teams from<br/>
other organizations. Teams had to compete in costume,<br/>
so our team captain decided hobo costumes were<br/>
appropriate for a day spent dumpster diving and searching<br/>
for obscure junk. One of my teammates was a giant<br/>
of a man, sweet and shy, and he was so excited about<br/>
the scavenger hunt - he really looked the hobo part. At<br/>
the end of the event, there was a huge catered party for<br/>
all the paricipants at a nice hotel. My friend was enjoying<br/>
himself, piling his plate up at the buffet, when three<br/>
security guards came up to escort him out. The hosts<br/>
thought he was a homeless person who had crashed the<br/>
party. When he resisted, trying to explain he was<br/>
part of the event and in costume, the overzealous guards<br/>
got loud and jumpy, the partygoers stared wide-eyed.<br/>
Luckily he did have his friends there, and we were able<br/>
to call off the guards. We had a good laugh about it later,<br/>
but my friend was embarrassed and shaken up.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's just generally a good idea to be extremely<br/>
discrete when seeking a box. I'd go as far as waiting<br/>
until there were no people around at all before I did<br/>
any looking.<br/>

Wow, I didn't know that Charlestown cops were so "misguided."  And <br/>
this is where we are having our fall gathering.  My question is if <br/>
your friend is legally blind then who was driving her car? :-)<br/>

<br/>
She is partially sighted.  One eye is completely blind, the other is <br/>
half blind.  She can see as clearly as I can, but her field of vision <br/>
is limited.  Cover both of your eyes with your hands, then spread the <br/>
pinky finger of your right hand apart from the other fingers.  That's <br/>
what she can see.  Her license restricts her to driving during <br/>
daylight hours when the weather is clear.<br/>
<br/>
I've ridden with her and she does just fine.<br/>
