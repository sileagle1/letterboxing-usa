We are wondering if the fisherman at Under the Mountain not only loves to<br/>
smoke, but maybe also has a thing for Curious George &amp; turtles.  We stamped<br/>
in to that box back in April.  Where did we go :(<br/>
Haven't been to Bailey's yet, we'll have to get up there soon.<br/>
Well hope Little Dam is back soon so we all can find it.<br/>

book at Under the Mountain! Unless i 'mis-thumbed' a page. If I did, my <br/>
apologies. Anyway, no matter how you look at it I can't take credit for first <br/>
stamp there. SO.... i guess I'll have to begin my new 12 part series soon. <br/>
Not sure if it'll be a mystery-sequential series or open though. Guess we'll <br/>
have to see!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Eric, I think your note about the boxy fisherman is priceless! I'm <br/>
not sure how he stumbled across that box unless he was up to <br/>
something fishy way off-trail!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I didn't post a heads-up about Little Dam being washed away <br/>
(likely by fishermen as well?). Melissa and Dan had dropped me a note <br/>
a month ago. That's a pretty long walk to find the hiding place <br/>
scattered and the box gone.<br/>
<br/>
Others that are missing that I know of:<br/>
-Cherry Blossoms in Washington DC (plan to replace soon)<br/>
-Fort Adams in Newport RI (graciously re-carved and hidden by Phil)<br/>
-Box #3 at Quiet Corner in CT<br/>
-Box #1 at Traprock House in Holyoke MA<br/>
-Lonely Ledge at Seven Falls in Hadlyme CT<br/>
