the Haunted series by the Maplines.  8 Cute stamps, spread out over <br/>
several locales.  They're only out until Halloween, so if you haven't <br/>
done them, time's a wastin'!!  On the way back towards home, we <br/>
stopped and did the new 2 box series in Hebron-- The Innocents.  A <br/>
great,little hike in the woods that doesn't take too long if you <br/>
don't have oodles of time. Toad loved it there!!!  Heed their warning <br/>
about the speed bumps- there are several!! Happy Boxing- Sunshine :0)<br/>
