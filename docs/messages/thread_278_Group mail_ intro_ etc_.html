                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone. I'd like to take a<br/>
second to introduce myself, but<br/>
first things first:<br/>
<br/>
I messed up I think. Initially, I<br/>
subscribed to the digest, because<br/>
I feared my mailbox would be too full.<br/>
But now I want to subscribe to the<br/>
regular list and cannot figure out<br/>
how this is done. I thought un-subbing<br/>
and then re-subbing would do the <br/>
trick, but somehow I don't think<br/>
that worked... and I have no clue<br/>
if I'm still subbed or not. <shrug><br/>
Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Daniel, thank you for the introduction.<br/>
I feel like a babe in the woods here<br/>
with all you "veterans" of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
My name's Michelle Spalding. I'm a 37<br/>
year old woman living outside of Boulder<br/>
Colorado. I have done some horseback<br/>
orienteering in my distant past, and have<br/>
dabbled in treasure questing (Kit William's <br/>
"Masquerade" et al). I'm a professional<br/>
artist/webmistress and my other interests<br/>
include animals, glass, antiques, old movies,<br/>
and science.<br/>
<br/>
Last year while invalid/recovering from a <br/>
serious illness, I read the Smithsonian<br/>
article and was so excited about it I <br/>
chattered for days. I promised myself if<br/>
I recovered fully, I would make a trip<br/>
to Dartmoor in hopes of tracking down at<br/>
least one box. I searched the web for sites<br/>
about letterboxing in the states, but came<br/>
up empty-handed. Then while organizing my<br/>
bookmarks last week, I found LetterboxUSA linked <br/>
from a Dartmoor site. So now I'm excited<br/>
all over again!<br/>
<br/>
I'm brainstorming about planting my first<br/>
letterbox here in Colorado, but really<br/>
have no idea where I want to go first.<br/>
In my excitement, I went out yesterday and <br/>
purchased a box, some little notebooks,<br/>
a stamp pad and ink, some carving tools<br/>
(what fun!), and a handful of erasers<br/>
to practice on in my spare time.<br/>
Eventually, I will put together my<br/>
box, plant it, and write up clues...<br/>
but for now I'm just playing with ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this letter is getting long, but<br/>
I would love to hear feedback on a<br/>
specific subject: Group or individual<br/>
opinion on custom (commercial) stamps vs.<br/>
hand-carved original stamps in letterboxes.<br/>
I truly understand the value and aesthetic <br/>
appeal of hand-carved stamps (and plan to<br/>
do my own carvings), but... there is<br/>
discussion here about box vandalism,<br/>
and so I cringe at the thought of <br/>
spending hours on a stamp only to<br/>
have it swiped or destroyed. I guess<br/>
my question is: since many people<br/>
prize collecting original stampings, <br/>
would it lessen the experience to<br/>
have a commercially-made COPY of the<br/>
original carving in the box? Additionally,<br/>
is vandalism a frequent occurence, or<br/>
just a part of the "adventure" of <br/>
letterboxing? I fear there will be two<br/>
types of letterbox vandals in Colorado:<br/>
Inconsiderate people, and militant <br/>
environmentalists... seems like those two<br/>
types comprise about 98% of the population<br/>
here. ;O)<br/>
<br/>
On the subject of advertising. I dislike<br/>
them personally, and also feel they<br/>
detract from a site's quality. I haven't<br/>
been a part of the group long enough<br/>
to have strong opinions one way or the<br/>
other, but generally speaking, pop-up<br/>
ads are not worth any potential revenue<br/>
they may bring. Most people find them<br/>
annoying at the very least.<br/>
<br/>
I do love the idea of special stamps as <br/>
reward/commemorative for outstanding<br/>
collections. I have NO stampings yet<br/>
(well okay, one that I made and planned to<br/>
use if we ever hopped the pond and<br/>
letterboxed on Dartmoor).<br/>
<br/>
On a personal note, due to my recent disability,<br/>
I will likely be unable to access many<br/>
letterboxes that are located in excessively<br/>
rough terrain... at least for a while.<br/>
If any of you are actively planting boxes<br/>
around here and there, I would love see<br/>
clues indicate those boxes that are easily<br/>
accessible. Thank you to the clue-givers that<br/>
are descriptive about the level of terrain<br/>
difficulty in your clues.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I hope I get my group mail subscription<br/>
sorted out. I look very forward to taking<br/>
part in discussions here and also contributing<br/>
wherever whenever I'm able!<br/>

While I hope that none of my stamps are ever stolen or destroyed, I don't<br/>
really worry about it.  It shouldn't take hours to carve a stamp.  I don't<br/>
think I've spent more than 20 minutes carving a stamp yet.  Your mileage<br/>
may vary, but if it's taking you hours to do a letterbox stamp, it might be<br/>
too intricate.  Consider simple designs, etc.  You can see some of my<br/>
"under 20 minute" stamps at http://www.users.fast.net/~martyc if you'd like<br/>
to see them.<br/>

I'd love to plant your Colorado box! No,<br/>
I'd be honored! Just as long as you don't<br/>
need it planted right away. I won't have<br/>
a free schedule until toward the end of<br/>
March.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I won't be able to plant any boxes<br/>
at higher altitudes than about 7k feet until<br/>
my health has fully recovered.<br/>
<br/>
Will this be acceptable? If not, I'm quite<br/>
positive I can get a wilderness photog <br/>
friend of mine to plant it on his next outing.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know the particulars!<br/>

Oh darn. You took the wind out of my sails.<br/>
There's nothing I love more than fussing<br/>
for hours over an art project. I admit part<br/>
of the appeal of letterboxing for me is <br/>
creating cool original artwork. Now you tell<br/>
me I should keep it under 20 minutes? <br/>
I don't know if I have it in me. ;OD<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to this stamp-carving thing. With<br/>
some practice and inspiration I'll get the<br/>
hang of it. I may even come to enjoy <br/>
the "limited edition" aspect of hand-carved<br/>
stamps gone missing. Replacing them with<br/>
new editions may not be so bad after all.<br/>
See? I'm getting past my fears already.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I love your stamps! Thanks for sharing<br/>
ideas with me.<br/>

<br/>
now... don't go and lop off a finger trying to beat his time!!<br/>
<br/>
as for hiding the box....  don't spend so much time worrying about where<br/>
it should go... there are probably 20 - 30 good spots near where you<br/>
are.  I have planted one so far away that it is a chore to go check on<br/>
it.  Think of someplace you can get to in less than an hour &amp; without<br/>
requiring offroad or climbing equipment (I pretty much messed up on all<br/>
3 of those hints for my first box).  The duelling boxes Mitch and I have<br/>
placed near home have been much more fun &amp; I check them every once in<br/>
awhile when I walk the dog.  We have had some sad losses in highly<br/>
public areas within this group, so I wouldn't recommend placing it under<br/>
a bench in your local mall.... but it can be as much fun to look in a<br/>
local park as out on some distant vista that took 4 days of planning and<br/>
3 of driving to accomplish.<br/>
<br/>
happy boxing<br/>

&gt;   It shouldn't take hours to carve a stamp.  I don't<br/>
&gt;  think I've spent more than 20 minutes carving a stamp yet. <br/>
&gt;  Your mileage may vary, but if it's taking you hours to do a<br/>
&gt;  letterbox stamp, it might be too intricate. <br/>
<br/>
"Whoa there, Red Rider!" My two cents says that the whole<br/>
concept should remain individual! There are some who may <br/>
carve out a gorgeous stamp in 20 minutes or less, and those of us,<br/>
ahem... who take 20 minutes to just get ready to carve a <br/>
stamp! It's all OK! I don't think everyone should have the <br/>
same goals. My suggestion would be that you do as <br/>
your heart desires, and if it takes a long time ~ make a camera<br/>
ready copy and have it made into a rubber stamp. Then if it goes<br/>
missing, and you aren't ready to let it go, you can replace it<br/>
easily and still have your hand-carved gem in hand.<br/>
    To address the original question about hand-carved versus<br/>
commercial, or even ("original hand-carved stamp" or "RS copy<br/>
of hand-carved stamp") ~ my opinion is that while a hand-carved<br/>
image will have a certain cachet, most people will not turn up<br/>
their noses at any stamp, hand-carved or commercial. I don't think<br/>
that we have an "official" group answer to this question, nor do I<br/>
think we should. I believe that L-USA should provide instruction<br/>
in the crafts and skills involved in letterboxing, guidelines for <br/>
"playing" in the USA, good-spirited conversation and friendly<br/>
advice, but not strict rules and regs, even implied, about what <br/>
kind of stamps to place, what kind of imagery or words should<br/>
be on them, what kinds of clues should be written, or where the<br/>
boxes should be placed.<br/>

I agree 100% (though I carve not-so-gorgeous stamps!).  Your stamps are<br/>
works of art!  Let's just say we're from different "schools" of carving.<br/>
I'm definitely in the Q.A.D. school (Quick And Dirty).<br/>

I'm not in a school at all.  I had somebody else make my first stamp<br/>
(it was from my drawing at least) and the next 2 stamps I bought at <br/>
a gift shop.<br/>
