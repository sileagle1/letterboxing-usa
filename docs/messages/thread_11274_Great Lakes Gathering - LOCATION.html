Michigan, I was able to ride down and check out locations for the May <br/>
31st G.L. Letterbox gathering.<br/>
<br/>
The final choice is Waterloo Recreation Area, near Chelsea, MI.  This <br/>
location seemed to meet all of our criteria and had an available <br/>
shelter for our date at the Big Portage Lake Unit.<br/>
<br/>
I've updated the gathering info page and added some lodging/camping <br/>
for those who are planning to stay overnight and would like to make <br/>
arrangements.<br/>
