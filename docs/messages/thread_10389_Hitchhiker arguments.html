                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK...I've picked up my mail after several days...and was inundated with the <br/>
arguements about hitchhikers...<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of beating a dead horse...I'll put in my two cents and leave it <br/>
at that.<br/>
<br/>
First...this is a hobby...It is meant to be fun, that is why there are <br/>
really no rules...so if someone likes placing a hitchhiker...Good for them.<br/>
<br/>
Second...for those who do not like hitchhikers...who says you have to pick <br/>
them up...leave them for the next person...live and let live...someone else <br/>
is having fun...you do you want to ruin it for them.<br/>
<br/>
Third...Did anyone ever think that someone has a reason for making a <br/>
hitchhiker?  I made one to commerate a deceased pet who was very well known <br/>
around my area.  I used the stamp that was her "signature" knowing that she <br/>
enjoyed traveling around and haming it up for the audiences...that meant <br/>
something to me.  It bothers me when you disparage my work.<br/>
<br/>
Finally...I guess what I'm trying to say to the naysayers out there is...Get <br/>
A Life!!!  Remember that this is a strictly volunteer effort...no one gets <br/>
paid to place boxes...and the only thing that the disgruntled ones are doing <br/>
is ruining it for everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure that the naysayers are going to attack me for my comments...but <br/>
I'll continue to place a hitchhiker when I feel that it is appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
Yours in Letterboxing<br/>
