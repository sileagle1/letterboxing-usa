(like myself) You might just retire some of those boxes that go <br/>
missing all the time, are water-logged all the time, or are gnawed on <br/>
by animals all the time!<br/>
<br/>
I decided that it was a great idea to retire some troublesome boxes. <br/>
They had been out there long enough for lots of folks to enjoy <br/>
finding them...and I have plenty of other letterboxes to maintain!<br/>
<br/>
Some boxes have been retired and replaced with different boxes in <br/>
different locations with different clues. This just adds to the <br/>
letterboxing experience for the local letterboxes! And the retired <br/>
stamp takes on the cachet of being RARE! No longer available!!<br/>
