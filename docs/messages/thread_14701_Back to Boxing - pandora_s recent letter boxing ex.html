<br/>
So my ankle is healed and Iron`Bear and Sim Kitty (That is what I am<br/>
nicknaming his daughter Simone) headed out letterboxing this last week.<br/>
<br/>
We headed first to Frog Park -- after much looking and much to our dismay we<br/>
are reporting this box missing. =(<br/>
<br/>
Next we were off to the Clackamas County College Campus -- <br/>
<br/>
First we stopped for the Duck Pond Friends Series.  We found the first box,<br/>
all in tact, great stamp, great location, great fun! This was Sim Kitty's<br/>
first letterbox and she found it! We didn't bother with the second box in<br/>
this series as it is already confirmed missing.<br/>
<br/>
Next we were off to Perseus.  Nice little hike, great clues, but<br/>
unfortunately this box seems to be missing as well.<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least we decided to hit the Box in a Box series by Wild Woman.<br/>
This series is a little tricky to find the starting point on, but we<br/>
eventually decided that we were suppose to start at the compost area of the<br/>
campus.  Unfortunately the campus is under construction and we just could<br/>
not find the starting point and decided to call it a day after look and<br/>
looking in severely hot weather.  Probably a set we will set back and try to<br/>
start again, if anyone could give any pointers it would be much appreciated.<br/>
I personally have heard great things about Wild Woman and her letterboxes,<br/>
so I am sure that between the hot weather and the construction on the campus<br/>
we were just to burned out to find it.<br/>
<br/>
All in all we tried for 4 different letterboxes/series and ended up with one<br/>
for the day, but hey that is the way it goes sometimes.  It was great fun<br/>
and Sim Kitty loves the new sport.  If anyone could recommend some Oregon<br/>
area boxes that are really great to take kids along I would really<br/>
appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Keep Boxing!<br/>

I'm patting myself on the back here but, the Shakespeare Box in Ashland Ore <br/>
is great for kids. It's a great town and introducing kids to Shakespeare in <br/>
those fabulous theaters is well worth it! Even if you don't have tickets to a <br/>
play, they're often available before the performances from locals who sell their <br/>
tickets when they can't go at the last minute. Just stand in front of the box <br/>
office with a sign that reads "Need 2" or "3" or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
 Anyway, this Lb takes you through a lovely park. Take a look at the clues on <br/>
the website and I think you'll like what you see.<br/>
