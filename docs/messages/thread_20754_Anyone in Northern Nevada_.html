Hi Nevadans!<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone up in the northern half of the state who would be <br/>
willing to adopt some boxes for me?  My sister will be planting some <br/>
in Reno &amp; Sparks over the Thanksgiving weekend while she's visiting <br/>
family.  (Definitely 2 boxes, maybe 4.)  I'm confident in her hiding <br/>
skills, but somewhat nervous about leaving my "babies" (stamps I'm <br/>
very proud of) alone almost 3,000 miles from "home" (Georgia).  If <br/>
there are any placers in Tahoe or elsewhere in N. NV who wouldn't <br/>
mind checking on them every few months, I would be really <br/>
grateful...and it would give you a chance to do some planting in <br/>
territory with NO boxes currently!  (Ooh, virgin letterboxing land!!)<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to contact me off-list if you like.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a ton!<br/>

I just checked my atlas, and I'm sorry to say that no, there are no<br/>
people in Northern Nevada.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I'm just kidding, of course, but the last time I went through, I<br/>
was heartily amused when I saw a billboard coming into Winnemucca<br/>
bragging about being a town where 'the streets are paved!!!!' <br/>

Ryan, you had me rolling with that one!!  My parents were raised in <br/>
Reno, and there are some definite sections of the roads up there <br/>
where you're right.  Let me amend:<br/>
<br/>
Ahem - Are there any LETTERBOXERS in Northern Nevada who are willing <br/>
to become adoptive box parents?  :P<br/>
