hasn't, the trash you may or may not be finding in areas that there are<br/>
letterboxes is NOT left by letterboxers. Letterboxers for the most part are<br/>
conscientious people that do more than their share of cleaning up the woods,<br/>
not trashing it. Unfortunately, some of the hiding places that are excellent<br/>
for letterboxes are also excellent places for teenagers and other hoodlums<br/>
to hang out with their friends and picnic or get drunk. I've found numerous<br/>
places that were great when the box was planted but later were found to be<br/>
homeless camps or locations of drunken orgies. The two are not necessarily<br/>
connected. <br/>

When I first read it, it made me wonder what creative excuses the personmight give the cops when they're caught shoplifting."There was this trash in the aisle and I was just trying to help.""It fell off the shelf and into my pocket.....what could I do?"~~ Mosey ~~-----Original Message-----From: letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com[mailto:letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com]On Behalf Of Gary &amp; ElizabethAndersonSent: Friday, August 10, 2007 7:49 PMTo: letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.comSubject: Re: [LbNA] TrashHummm,,, Well, I don't know about the lazy letterboxer, BUT, fromthe letter they posted, I kind of had the thought that maybe this wasthe person that was stealing all the letterboxes, and using[anybody's] litter in the area as an excuse. Now, as far as I'mconcerned, it's dead... although I'll probably always be curiouswhat/who the lazy letterboxer is... :-|Gary <br/>
