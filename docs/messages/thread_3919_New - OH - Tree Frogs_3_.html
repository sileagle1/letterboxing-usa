Near: Yellow Springs, Greene County, OH<br/>
Difficulty: 2 (Uneven hilly trail,  mile total)<br/>

Parking is a half mile from the other Valley of the Frogs boxes.  <br/>
Easiest parking is at The Wingo Picnic Area of John Bryan Park.  <br/>
Follow the signs from Yellow Springs for the park, 68 north from town <br/>
to 343 just outside town, then 370 to the entrance of the park.  Go <br/>
through the park toward and past the day lodge to Wingo.  Park closes <br/>
at dusk, dogs are to be on leash.  Coordinates for parking are N <br/>
39.79054 and W 83.85640.  You can use a GPS or the free map printing <br/>
service at www.topozone.com to find this place.<br/>
<br/>
All the Valley boxes are micro letterboxes.  They have small stamps <br/>
and their log book consists of a strip of paper.  All is contained in <br/>
a 35mm film canister.  Please bring a small signature stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
Valley of the Frogs: V Tree Frogs<br/>
<br/>
Unaware of my approach, three noble tree frogs sat on their rocks <br/>
singing songs.<br/>
<br/>
Yollk.<br/>
Yoke.<br/>
Yokeke<br/>
<br/>
"My, we sound good tonight brother!" said One.  <br/>
"Yess..oeke we do!  Don't you just thank God that we are not those <br/>
common river frogs singing down by the river?" said Two.<br/>
"Yoke, I do.  If it were not for the grace there go I.  Croaked <br/>
Three.  <br/>
"You ready to sing again brothers?   Maybe there are some pretty <br/>
green ladies about!" someone whispered.<br/>
<br/>
Take the gravel path out of the parking area south for 100 paces (1 <br/>
pace = 2 steps, about 5 feet) where the trail meets the Rim Trail.  <br/>
Turning right and proceeding for 26 paces across the wooden bridge <br/>
you run into a large tree growing out of a rock.  Up on top of the <br/>
rock, between the trunk and a larger rock is a small fist sized <br/>
rock.  Yollk!<br/>
<br/>
Proceeding along the path another 28 paces a side trail at 160 <br/>
degrees leads you down hill.  After 14 short paces, the trail <br/>
continues to the right at 240 degrees.  From the turn, proceed 14 <br/>
paces to a 10 foot tall spike of a stump.  Between the stump and a <br/>
large rock is a small pile of 3 stones.  Yoke!<br/>
<br/>
Continuing the same direction, 30 further paces, the trail turns hard <br/>
left to avoid a pile of rocks.  The rock closest to the cliff forms a <br/>
small alcove in which there is a white rock.  From behind the white <br/>
rock and some leaves, cozy in its nest, you hear Yokeke.<br/>
<br/>
Thus goes the pride of the tree frogs on their rocky perches.  Their <br/>
songs bring them visitors.<br/>
<br/>
This part of the park is very active with rock climbers.  Please be <br/>
discrete in your searching and stamping up.  And of course, have <br/>
fun!  <br/>
<br/>
Do you have 6 frogs in your collection?<br/>
