letterboxing friend (who really should post for himself one of these <br/>
days...). This was a more difficult trek for the three year old in our <br/>
party, with lots of off-trail walking. The ground was quite wet and <br/>
slippery in places with fallen trees over the path as well, but still <br/>
doable for little legs.<br/>
<br/>
There was a bit of water in the box when we found it, but the book and <br/>
stamp were safe and dry in their bags. The park itself was a little tricky <br/>
to find (at least for a driver distracted by chattering junior letterboxers <br/>
in the back seat) but was definitely worth the two hour drive for us.<br/>
