&gt; 2  will I merely place a copy of my personal stamp inside each box<br/>
&gt; I  plant? <br/>
<br/>
Each box you plant will have a unique stamp inside.  At least that's <br/>
how it usually works.  Occasionally people have been known to plant <br/>
the same stamp multiple times, but that's usually because they were <br/>
new to the hobby and didn't realize all the boxes have unique stamps!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 3. What are some of the treasures found by first finders?<br/>
<br/>
Most boxes don't have anything for first finders, but those that do <br/>
might have just darn anything you could think of.  Certificates, <br/>
coupons, glass figurines, and recently shriky-dink awards have been <br/>
discussed.  But the vast majority of boxes (in my experience) don't <br/>
leave anything at all for first finders, so don't think you *have* to <br/>
do that.  It's purely optional.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 4. Someone mentioned a kit. Where might I buy such a kit?<br/>
<br/>
There's nowhere you can buy a kit--typically, you make one up for <br/>
yourself with the things you'll need while letterboxing.  There are <br/>
*suggested* lists out there, but at a minimum, you'll want a <br/>
signature stamp, ink pad, pen, and a notebook.  Also nice are 'repair <br/>
tools' such as Ziplock bags to replace any that are falling apart in <br/>
the boxes you find.  Then--depending on where the box is located--you <br/>
might need water, food, sunscreen--the 'ten essentials' (though <br/>
nobody really agrees on which ten are really 'essential' *smile*)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Presumeably, you've already read the FAQ on <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org which is a good source of information.  <br/>
Silent Doug has lots of good stuff at http://www.letterboxing.info <br/>
you might find useful--along with TONS of links to other websites <br/>
with useful information.  <br/>

I noticed that no one here sent you to the Files for the list...<br/>
<br/>
On the left of your screen is the list of links within the chat <br/>
board. Go to Files.  In there is a list... What's In Your Kit? It <br/>
will have a list of things most Boxers may/may not put in <br/>
their "kits". <br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing! and Welcome from one Newbie to another!<br/>

PS <br/>
Don't always take the "grouches" seriously. They seem to get a kick <br/>
out picking on eachother. I think it makes it more fun for everyone <br/>
to have some fun with eachother. From what I can tell they would give <br/>
anything anyone asked for, they would just pretend to be cranky about <br/>
it. Boxers here seem to have a wonderful sense of community!  I think <br/>
for me that is part of what makes it addicting.  The people.  That's <br/>
just my opinion.<br/>
