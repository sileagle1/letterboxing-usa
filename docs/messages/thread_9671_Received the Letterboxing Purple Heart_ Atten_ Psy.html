Letterboxer2002 put a lot of work into this. He carved a great stamp and created

nice. The Order of the Purple Heart is 
awarded to members of Letterboxing North America who are wounded in the act of 
letterboxing.  This award will be sent via post to any letterboxer who is 
injured in the line of letterboxing and posts the story on the letterboxing talk

                    <div class="plaintext-content">--Good Afternoon Everyone! I just read all the posts following my <br/>
last posting and I feel VERY HONORED to be included in the Purple <br/>
Heart Club! Chuck look for my email after I address this latest <br/>
issue. <br/>
   1 - Everyone has a right to their own opinion<br/>
   2 - I'm sick and tired of all this political correctness<br/>
   3 - Letterboxing (to me) is about having FUN<br/>
   4 - Some people need to learn to relax and lighten up and not be <br/>
so petty<br/>
   5 - If those people mentioned above have ever gone through a real <br/>
life/death experience like I did. (I'm not talking about my stuck in <br/>
the mud experience) I'm talking about near the brink of death due to <br/>
cancer. They would learn to embrace the day and find the humor in <br/>
everyday happenings. Be it a difficult time, like falling down a <br/>
cliff, stuck in the mud, getting a bit (or a lot) lost looking for <br/>
one of Apple Dumpling Gangs Boxes. Ex: Froggy Series, FIND THE <br/>
POSITIVE in your situation. Because at the end of our journey it's <br/>
what we do with the situations that matter.<br/>
   6 - My family and friends appreciate having me in their lives. So <br/>
being saved by 14 handsome Police and Firemen was a great relief to <br/>
them. For my family it was no small matter.<br/>
   7 - Life does goes on without our loved ones in our world BUT it <br/>
does put a big emptiness in our lives once we have experienced that <br/>
loved ones special quality.<br/>
<br/>
   Finally, with all due respect for the FUN of the hunt I proudly <br/>
accept the Purple Heart. AND will pass it on to our next disabled <br/>
letterboxer when that time presents itself.<br/>
<br/>
   Humble servant of the Letterbox gods,<br/>
