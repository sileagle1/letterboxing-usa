Planted by: Mookie Fish<br/>
Name of box: FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH <br/>
Date planted: September 3, 2003<br/>
Town: Saratoga Springs<br/>
County: Saratoga<br/>
State: New York<br/>
Level of difficulty: Easy, sidewalks<br/>
Time: An hour<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From I-87, take exit 14. Take NY-9P/UNION AVE heading East. Turn <br/>
right onto Circular, then left onto Spring Street. At the stoplight, take a <br/>
left onto Broadway, then another left into the park.<br/>
<br/>
Begin your quest with Congress Spring<br/>
A water bottle you should bring<br/>
To taste Saratogas famous healing waters<br/>
Or to carry along if you get hotter.<br/>
Now hop over to Columbian Spring<br/>
(From this, ordinary city water is flowing.)<br/>
Head into the park to find where Deer Park Spring dips<br/>
Where once General George Washington put his lips.<br/>
(Alexander Hamilton drank here as well.)<br/>
Now head around the park for a spell.<br/>
Pass by the duck pond but feed them not,<br/>
Or a $50 fine will make you hot.<br/>
Morrisey Fountain is your next stop.<br/>
Go to the brick building, then take a hop.<br/>
Myth says the flow was a signal when gambling,<br/>
(an illegal venture in the old casino) was happening.<br/>
Now walk towards the place of the musical sound<br/>
its an historical wooden carved merry-go-round.<br/>
Across Spring Street you will head<br/>
To Hathorn Spring which is fed<br/>
with highly mineralized, diuretic liquid.<br/>
Doesnt it taste a bit like old squid?<br/>
Its because salty waters from ancient seas were trapped <br/>
in limestone layers which solid shale then capped.<br/>
Minerals from the limestone dissolve<br/>
Giving the water its unique resolve.<br/>
Continue north, disregard the strange looks,<br/>
past the public building full of books.<br/>
Continue down maple as long as you are able.<br/>
When you come the building where reporters do write<br/>
Go to the curb and look to your right.<br/>
Its the Farmers Market sign that you seek<br/>
But crossing Lake Ave. is not for the meek.<br/>
Follow to where the market sign points.<br/>
After the parking lot you can rest your joints.<br/>
If the Farmers Market is here, it will be quite busy.<br/>
Beyond this, Governor Spring tastes of iron and is natural fizzy.<br/>
Its friend, Peerless Spring, is palatable and mild<br/>
Mohawk Indians drank here when this place was still wild.<br/>
Venture further north still, past the renovated mills.<br/>
Old Red Spring was discovered soon after the Revolutionary War.<br/>
It boasted one of the first bathhouses  about 1784.<br/>
It is also known as the Spring of Beauty,<br/>
because healing disorders of the skin was its duty.<br/>
The spring got its name from the iron deposits <br/>
which form when the mineral-laden spring water sits.<br/>
Retrace your steps past the buildings of brick.<br/>
(Plug your nose if the sewer pumping station makes you sick.)<br/>
After the last mill, look for the black metal fence.<br/>
Trudge up the walkway, which makes your legs tense.<br/>
The Old Bryan Inn was erected in 1832, no doubt<br/>
on the site of a log cabin of a revolutionary scout.<br/>
At the sign for High Rock Park,<br/>
Follow the metal chains down into the dark.<br/>
To get to the rock ledge on the left<br/>
Give the chains a great big heft.<br/>
Look for the box in the fissures of the fault line.<br/>
If you hungry, continue to the Farmers Market to dine.<br/>
