area on your right, turn into it and park there at the trailhead.  <br/>

<br/>
Facilities: A primitive restroom is located at Weyer Point (1-1/4 <br/>
miles into the hike). <br/>
<br/>
`Where the Wild Things Are' Letterbox (my humblest apologies to <br/>
author Maurice Sendak):<br/>
<br/>
Level of difficulty:   Easy 2 mile walk.  Clues easy.  Primitive <br/>
dirt, gravel &amp; boardwalk trail with stairs and muddy areas.  <br/>
<br/>
Setting:  Woodard Bay Trail along Henderson Inlet of Puget Sound.  <br/>
Gorgeous wooded area formerly owned by Weyerhaeuser, Oyster/Clam <br/>
Companies and the Woodard Family.  <br/>
<br/>
Restrictions:  No pets or bicycles.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Start at the Woodard Bay Trail sign.  This time Max awoke in <br/>
the middle of the night wearing his wolf suit and wanting to make <br/>
more mischief even though he had just woken up from an early trip to <br/>
bed without any supper for the mischief he made the night prior.  It <br/>
seems his mother called "Wild Thing!" and he responded with "I'll <br/>
eat you up!"  He awoke to find himself amidst a forest that had <br/>
grown and grown, with vines hung from above and walls becoming the <br/>
world around him.  This world included the gentle waters of Woodard <br/>
Bay flowing from the Puget Sound and the sloping hillside of the <br/>
land that met with the waters of the bay.  <br/>
<br/>
     Off he went looking for an adventure along the Woodard Bay <br/>
trail.  Through night and day and in and out of weeks and almost <br/>
over a year heading to where the wild things are.  Along his trip he <br/>
came to a `Loop'y Trail, known as a place where the wild things <br/>
live, roaring terrible roars and gnashing terrible teeth, rolling <br/>
terrible eyes and showing terrible claws.  He ventured along this <br/>
trail, braving the wild things and after two sets of stairs saw <br/>
the "old man of the forest", a tree with thick bark full of holes <br/>
made by woodpeckers.  He thought this tree might be 500 years old!   <br/>
He continued to brave the wild things and soon came to a "dog hair" <br/>
forest where the trees are as thick as the hairs on a dog's back; <br/>
they look young because they aren't very big around, but they are <br/>
actually a half a century or olderthey just live under poor growing <br/>
conditions.  The wild things continued to roar their terrible roars, <br/>
gnash their terrible teeth, roll their terrible eyes and show their <br/>
terrible claws.  Max only knew of one way to quiet the wild things.  <br/>
He did this by saying "Be Still" and staring into their yellow eyes <br/>
without blinking until the wild things were frightened and <br/>
eventually called him, Max, the king of all wild things.  He <br/>
exclaimed "let the wild rumpus start!"  Max &amp; the wild things danced <br/>
along the trail, up and down stairs, across board walks, past a red <br/>
elderberry sign and 4 benches.  They swung from the branches along <br/>
the trail leading to a `Y'. They paraded along veering left at <br/>
the `Y' and soon tired.  Max told the wild things to stop and sent <br/>
them all to bed without their supper.  <br/>
<br/>
     Then Max was lonely and hungry and sitting on that bench <br/>
overlooking Chapman Bay!  He thought he smelled good things to eat <br/>
and headed 4 paces NE from the right side of the bench.  Here on his <br/>
left, he found a large, dying, fuzzy tree.  Within a root at its <br/>
right rear side, instead of finding good smells, he found yet <br/>
another wild thing; for here is `where the wild things are' lying <br/>
under some bark.   The wild thing was so hungry and stated "Please <br/>
don't goI'll eat you upI love you so!"  Max quickly stamped in and <br/>
covered it up! <br/>
<br/>
      To escape the wild thing, Max quickly headed back to the 'Y', <br/>
got back on the main trail to finish the Loop.  Along the rest of <br/>
the loop, he saw an upturned Douglas-fir tree with very shallow <br/>
roots that had fallen during a wind-storm.  He remembered that he <br/>
should never visit the forest in high winds.  Soon, thereafter, he <br/>
came to the `poison oak trees'Douglar-fir trees wrapped all around <br/>
with poison oak vines the width of an adult arm.  These were <br/>
definitely `wild' things!  A little bit later, he came across a <br/>
small wetland that came to be years ago when trees were logged in <br/>
this area.  He noticed the duckweed carpet on the water and the <br/>
newts that were all around.  He knew he better not touch the newts, <br/>
for their skin was poisonous (though oddly not to garter snakes).   <br/>
Then, he came to a junction with Witham Road.  He headed left so he <br/>
could see the awesome sights at Weyer Point and possibly find the <br/>
good smells of food.  He saw what he could (harbor seals, great blue <br/>
herons, kingfishers, sea gulls, clams, oysters &amp; learned a history <br/>
lesson or twowhich included a `boat-jacking') but he didn't find <br/>
any food.  He was still hungry, though.  He turned around and headed <br/>
along the paved road back toward the good smells of his mother's <br/>
cooking and found exactly what he was looking for-- a ride home.<br/>
