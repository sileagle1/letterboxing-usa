 &gt;were normally 59 cents but on sale for 75% off--so for the grand<br/>
 &gt;total of 15 cents each I came away with several awesome sturdy<br/>
 &gt;containers worthy of letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
Woo!  I go to Value Village all the time for hardcover books (book <br/>
altering's my primary art form at the moment), and I can't believe that <br/>
I never thought of getting tupperware from there before!  I know where <br/>
I'm going tomorrow....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &gt;PS  Can't wait for the Roslyn series.  I just placed one in the<br/>
 &gt;Olympics Natl Park during a recent camping/letterboxing trip.<br/>
 &gt;Perhaps that park is worthy of a full series?  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I (heart) the Olympics.  Ben had been promising a trip up there with a <br/>
backpacking kind of focus, but we haven't had a chance yet this summer. <br/>
  (Did a road trip tour down into CA for vacation instead.)  I'm all for <br/>
a series up that way!<br/>
<br/>
And the Roslyn series is ALMOST carved.  Couple more to go.  I've got a <br/>
couple of locations scouted, too.... :)<br/>
