it has its original log book and stamps although they have suffered water damage <br/>

It is an easy find and still recieves visitors (from as far away as scotland).  <br/>

Locally in Northern Virginia the Clark's Crossing box in Vienna, while <br/>

planting Sept. 10, 2000, and still has the original stamp and logbook, <br/>
as well as newer replacement logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is important for boxes to have their original logbooks <br/>
whenever possible, it is nice, when you find an older box, to be able to <br/>
look back in that logbook and see who has been there over the years.<br/>

Hey, congratulations!!! Which box is 15? I tried to find it on his site, but hitting NEXT at the bottom makes the pages jump from 14 to 16. When I put in 15, I got a D'oh.<br/>
<br/>
I've been looking on the internet for anything mapsurfer related but the most recent posts are all in 2009. Glad there's something more recent.<br/>
<br/>
I found Name of the Box not too long ago, but Randy hasn't marked it as found because the box was missing. I replanted it for him so hopefully that will be good enough.<br/>
<br/>
Been pulling my hair out over McBrae's Scrapbook.<br/>
