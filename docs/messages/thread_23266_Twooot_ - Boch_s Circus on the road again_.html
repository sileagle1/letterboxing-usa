Spring has sprung and so has Boch's Circus from winter hibernation. <br/>
<br/>
I went down to the train station yesterday. Amidst the excitement of <br/>
the busy platform I waved "bon show" to the departing circus train. <br/>
The ears of the Dancing Dog flapped in the wind as it hung out the <br/>
window. Boch's Traveling Circus and Wild Menagerie is back on the <br/>
road for a new season of regaling an appreciative audience with some <br/>
of the finest impressions of physical entertainment from around the <br/>
country. ["And more blather from his Ringmaster <br/>
Verboseness." "Hushh."] As I was saying ...<br/>
<br/>
Upcoming performances include:<br/>
<br/>
-Ice Cream Sundae Letterboxing Event - Carlisle, Massachusetts - <br/>
April 23, 2006<br/>
<br/>
---A sampling half dozen of some of our finest and fun acts. <br/>
<br/>
-Wilmington Film Fest - Wilmington, North Carolina - May 13, 2006<br/>
<br/>
---At the Film Fest we plan a rambunkxious Circus Clown reunion when <br/>
a new act joins us. Introduced by his great grand neice, Bert Leo <br/>
shall make a triumphal return to the "great show" and meet Boch's <br/>
other circus clownsters. (We have more clowns than I even realized.) <br/>
Yes his real great grand niece will attend and has graciously agreed <br/>
to exchange and sign autographs.<br/>
<br/>
Many other new acts joined us in our last travels and are available <br/>
for future performances:<br/>

Onward with the shows.<br/>
