                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>We spent an absolutely perfect day in Coventry, CT, and stamped our way into ten boxes, a personal best for us! We should have had eleven, but more on that in the next post.....
<br/>
<br/>The boxes we visited, in no particular order: 
<br/>
<br/>Lake Wangumbaug: No problems here, everything intact. Great view of the lake!
<br/>
<br/>Mousing in Laidlaw Park: The clues are a bit misleading, but we found the box. All in perfect working order.
<br/>
<br/>Glass Factory: I was really wishing I had my fishing pole here! Quick and easy, no problems.
<br/>
<br/>Red Bird and Skungamaug River: Both of these boxes have seen a lot of visitors. Unfortunately, we were here on a weekday, so no one was flying. 
<br/>
<br/>Stars and Stripes Forever: Unfortunately, we were here too early in the day to see the museum. Great stamp, but hard to keep things secret here. We were glad there was no one around but us.
<br/>
<br/>Uncle Sam's Nephew: See above description.
<br/>
<br/>When I Was a Girl in the Martin Series: Great concept for a drive-by series. The second box was very hard to get at without attracting attention, but that was half the fun of these three. A surprising amount of visitors for boxes that are only a week old!
