                    <div class="plaintext-content">We went up to Rye today to visit the 3 letterboxes hidden - but we<br/>
only found one!  Maybe we were trying to read too much into the clues<br/>
or something.  We found the Rye Beach letterbox (and man, was that<br/>
ever a scramble - dangerous if you're carrying a baby on a backpack,<br/>
btw - there are at least 2 other safer ways to get to it) - the lid<br/>
was cracked, but we didn't have anything on us to fix it.  We enjoyed<br/>
the walk to it - the row of sugar maples is awesome and many of the<br/>
trees along the way had blossoms on them.<br/>
<br/>
We were unable to locate the Odiorne Point and the Suzy Sells Sea<br/>
Shells letterboxes, though.  Either they're not there anymore or we<br/>
need to brush up on our rusty letterboxing skills.  Hopefully it's the<br/>
latter!  We had fun, though.  Emma, our daughter, had a blast crawling<br/>
around on the grass for the first time and eating pebbles and<br/>
dandelions.  Yum.<br/>
<br/>
We planted another letterbox in the area - clues to come later.<br/>
