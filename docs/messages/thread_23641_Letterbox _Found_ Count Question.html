<br/>
My nephew and I just completed a day of letterboxing on Cape Cod and we  were <br/>
wondering if each box in a series (such as the 7 beautifully carved stamps  <br/>
in the Star Wars series in West Barnstable)  is considered a separate  <br/>
letterbox find.  Each stamp had their own clues but they were all typed  together on <br/>
the Star Wars series sheet that we downloaded from the Letterboxing  Website.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is our first series that we have done and don't know how to include it  <br/>
in our total count of LB's found.  Please advise.  Thank  you.....GlobeBear <br/>

You didn't mention if each box had its own log book or if there was just one book at the end of the series.  Although technically it would be only 1 find if there was only 1 log book, some people do count individual finds in that situation because there were individual boxes.  You will have to decide that for yourself.<br/>

Most of the time each box has it's own logbook, but recently I have <br/>
found a few where only one of the series has a log book, and the others <br/>
just have stamps. Some people might not count these, because they don't <br/>
have a seperate log, but I do, and the sites do (if you log your find on <br/>
the site it will count up 10 stamps for the Save the Smurfs series even <br/>
though there is only one box.).<br/>
