<br/>
Date placed: 10/18/03<br/>
Terrain: Easy to moderate<br/>
Clues: Easy to moderate<br/>
Time: 4 to 5 hours round trip<br/>
Number of boxes: 2<br/>
<br/>
I listed these as mystery boxes, but they are not a mystery. The reason that <br/>
I posted these  as mystery boxes is because they are places that I do not <br/>
the general public to find. (I DO NOT WANT THESE CLUES POSTED ANYWHERE ON <br/>
THE WEB).  To get the clues, you must e-mail me and I will e-mail them to <br/>
you.<br/>
These are 2 of the most interesting places that I have found in the Quabbin <br/>
Reservation.<br/>
This hike will take 4-5 hours and does involve paying close attention to the <br/>
clues. There is one section that you will need to do some bushwhacking.<br/>
You could bicycle part of the way, which would take 2-3 hours. You would <br/>
have to leave your bikes in the woods on the side of the trail.<br/>
There is also one other box on the way to these boxes, so you could get 3 <br/>
boxes on this hike.<br/>
Sorry, dogs are not allowed at the Quabbin.<br/>
To get the clues, email me at dbastarache@hotmail.com and put Mystery Boxes <br/>
in the subject line.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>
