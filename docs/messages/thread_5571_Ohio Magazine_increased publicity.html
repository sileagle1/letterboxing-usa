                    <div class="plaintext-content">And just where was your freedom of speech infringed<br/>
upon?  I'm sorry, I just don't see it. You said what<br/>
you wanted and asked for opinions on what to do-<br/>
that's opening yourself up to all aspects of<br/>
discussion. That's a part of the process of a group,<br/>
I'm sorry if you don't agree with it.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, have been wondering if increased publicity is<br/>
going to be our doing in. I wonder how many of us feel<br/>
the same way?  I can tell you that I cringed when I<br/>
see that this yahoo-group has been inflitrated by<br/>
someone who is only here looking for a story to<br/>
publish for their newspaper for $$. And who volunteers<br/>
for these things right off?  Those who have been<br/>
nurturing this hobby all these years, even through<br/>
thin pickings, or those who have just come about<br/>
it??That's another thing to consider.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I would have never known about this hobby<br/>
unless I read about it in the Blue Mountain Sports<br/>
free magazine given out in their stores.  <br/>
We've also been discussing how to get more boxes in<br/>
the Adirondacks and how a small-town newspaper was<br/>
sent a small article.  I don't have a problem with<br/>
that as there won't be hordes of people flocking to<br/>
read these small town rags. The locals who read it and<br/>
possibly come into this hobby will likely be more<br/>
caring about 'their' boxes and 'their'<br/>
town/environment than someone coming in for just the<br/>
find. <br/>
It seems that small venues are good tools to gain more<br/>
boxers but when we start talking about the Washington<br/>
Post I really get worried!!<br/>
<br/>
It's a complicated subject but certainly voicing one's<br/>
opinion is NOT taking away someone else's freedom of<br/>
speech. Me thinks more people need to understand what<br/>
their freedoms really are and not what they perceive<br/>
them to be- but that's for another forum. :o)<br/>

&gt; Hey, I said the article has not come out yet.  I<br/>
&gt; have not recieved mine in<br/>
&gt; the mail, the local library does not have it yet and<br/>
&gt; it is not on the<br/>
&gt; newsstands yet. The box went missing before that so<br/>
&gt; please don't blame us or<br/>
&gt; the article. Thanks!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here we go again.........my freedom of speech is<br/>
&gt; being taken away. Geez!<br/>
&gt; Guess I will crawl back into my cave again to avoid<br/>
&gt; this negativism, busszz!<br/>
&gt; Some days you just can't win!!<br/>
