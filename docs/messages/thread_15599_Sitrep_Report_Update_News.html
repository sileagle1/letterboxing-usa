Just wanted to take a moment and announce that Team Rayvenhaus hit F100 today.  WE made an early day and headed off to grab the last few we needed to break the 100 mark and we did... We're pretty beat so the stories will have to come later. WE were up and put the door before first light today and just now returned home.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, here we are, at F101 and all within 2 months!  That's right, we started on Aug 7th, 2003 and we broke 100 on Sept 6th, 2003!!!<br/>
<br/>
Gawd, I love this hobby!!!!!<br/>

Once again, it's up to me, RayvenMom to set the story straight as it's<br/>
obvious that the lack of sleep impeding Steve's brain has finally taken it's<br/>
toll on his ability to gauge actual time...<br/>
<br/>
2 months - that much is true...  However, our first stamp was found on JULY<br/>
7th (not August 7th as he seems to think)..<br/>
<br/>
But for now, that's it for my story-telling... the bed is calling my name<br/>
pretty loudly for a well deserved nap!!!<br/>
<br/>
Good night!<br/>

 WOW!... you got an extremely early start! It sounds like quite an <br/>
obsession - LOL! I love letterboxing, but out the door before first <br/>
light?! Not likely for me. ;)<br/>
 I really do envy those in the northern part of our country who can <br/>
actually get to 100 without going on major vacations. I have found <br/>
every letterbox except one (currently unreachable) within a 2 hour <br/>
radius of my location. And that is no where near 100. ;) <br/>

our 'little' state probably has over 300 letterboxes.  The adage 'if <br/>
you place them, they will come' has certainly come true in this <br/>
area.  Don't worry, give it time, plant some boxes here, there &amp; <br/>

letterboxers/letterboxes in your region, too.<br/>

letterboxes. I have 4 more ready to go... and one postal traveler <br/>
letterbox that will be ready in the very near future...and plans for <br/>
two more carvings to go with my Rest In Peace series.<br/>
<br/>
We only take one cross country vacation a year, and just a few <br/>
weekend trips in our state each year. And we had just returned from <br/>
this year's vacation when I got involved in letterboxing. We have a <br/>
weekend trip planned for October, to a cornfield maze, but with <br/>
extended family along, it may be difficult to stop to letterbox. <br/>
There are not many boxes up that way either, though. I would love to <br/>
take a weekend trip... or a really long day trip to San Antonio for <br/>
the 3? letterboxes there. That may turn out to be our next <br/>
letterboxing opportunity.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the encouragement! :)<br/>
