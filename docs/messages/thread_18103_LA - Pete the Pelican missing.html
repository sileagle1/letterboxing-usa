                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry to report that Pete the Pelican is missing from his nest.  The <br/>
dock he was hiding under has been torn down by the park and a new <br/>
one built.  No trace of Pete, his box, or the really special journal <br/>
and pencil that were with him.<br/>
<br/>
I would have hoped that BREC (Baton Rouge Recreation and Parks <br/>
Commission) would have more respect for the welfare of wildlife than <br/>
to just pitch Pete out with the trash, but...<br/>
<br/>
I will re-carve and re-plant Pete at first opportunity.  I hope <br/>
those of you who had already visited will come back and restamp when <br/>
I get him comfortably placed in his new habitat. Stay tuned.<br/>
<br/>
