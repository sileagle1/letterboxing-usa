<div>I usually don't respond to the chit chat on this 
site, but in this case I will make an exception.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> I have always figured that each one is 
responsible for his/her own safety. If one goes out unprepared, then one just 
may learn something. There is no reward, other than personal pleasure, to 
finding letterboxes [which is why I do not use merit patches], if you don't feel 
safe, comfortable or whatever, then turn around and go back.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I usually check out the terrain on one of my 
topographic software programs, then I know before hand, how long (distance), how 
steep (climbing and descending), and just how much time I should allow. To me, 
the whole point of letterboxing is the site, not the find. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The boxes I have planted are designed to be found. 
Generally they are not going to take a major expedition to find. Some are short 
"drive-by", some will take several hours. All do not impose any serious 
risk.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think the old sales slogan applies well in this 
situation. "let the buyer beware"</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If there are those of you who find it necessary to 
remove, reword, or modify your clues, so be it. At last count I think there are 
at least 500 boxes out there and growing every day.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please, use a little common sense. Some 
letterboxes are going to require physical effort, some letterboxes require 
mental effort, and some require both. The point is letterboxing is supposed to 
be fun. I, for one, hope to keep it that way.</div>

&gt; I think the old sales slogan applies well in this situation. "let <br/>
the buyer beware"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
The key word here is "old."  That slogan doesn't apply any more and <br/>
people reading this list aren't the ones I'm worried about.  <br/>
