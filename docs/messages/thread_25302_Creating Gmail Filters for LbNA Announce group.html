Some days the number of new boxes listed is significant and in parts of the country that I am not currently interested in for boxing. I want to receive notices from only one state. After inquiring of the letterboxing powers that be I learned that there are no such controls available through the Yahoo groups.<br/>
<br/>
I use Gmail almost exclusively so set out to create filters that will give me posts as they relate to Arizona and auto delete the ones from all other states. I ended up creating two filters, the second of which is probably not needed but haven't tested the system without it.<br/>
<br/>
Within Gmail next to the search the web button is a link in small print that says "create filter". Click on that link<br/>
<br/>
A box at the top of the page appears with 5 fill in the blank spaces.<br/>
<br/>
Starting on the left, the top space <br/>
from: announce@letterboxing.org<br/>
Leave the middle (next space down on left) blank<br/>
Third space down <br/>
subject: [lbox-announce]<br/>
<br/>
Move over to the right column<br/>
First space <br/>
has the words: leave blank<br/>
Next space down<br/>
Doesn't have: the name of the state you want to see. in my case AZ<br/>
<br/>
Click Next Step<br/>
I checked: delete it<br/>
and Gmail auto filled: skip inbox<br/>
<br/>
Then save.<br/>
<br/>
I created a second filter that I don't think is helping or hurting.<br/>
in the subject it says: [lbox-announce] AZ<br/>
and then on the next page: never send to spam.<br/>
<br/>
With the second set of test boxes I created and launched out of LbNA, the Arizona box announcements went to my Inbox and all the rest went to my trash, where they can still be seen if desired.<br/>
