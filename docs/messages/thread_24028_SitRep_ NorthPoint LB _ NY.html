                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi again to all in LB land, Found out that originally the lettterbox <br/>
was call "North Point" on post #26006. This letterbox is gone...only <br/>
the flat rocks that covered it are there under the small crevice <br/>
(break under 4 foot ledge)where it once was. <br/>
<br/>
So with that being said, the next time we are up there , we will <br/>
replace that one. Probasbly with a bought stamp (aah),i'm a slow stamp <br/>
maker!<br/>
<br/>
Also wanted to note that it would be "to far to make it to Stoppel <br/>
Point" at this time of the year since we are "late starters" during <br/>
the Winter months, maybe in the late Spring or early Summer we could <br/>
do it.<br/>
