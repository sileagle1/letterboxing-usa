                    <div class="plaintext-content">Woo Hoo!  I'm so excited about the prospect of combining these two <br/>
wonderful hobbies.  Seems in an instant my F count increased by <br/>
25%!  I can only expect my MIA box count to do the same with the <br/>
exponentially increased population visiting the boxes and the <br/>
ensuing paths blazed in their wake. ;) <br/>
<br/>
Way to go for the smooth &amp; expedient transition to the new site.  <br/>
Such a professional job, too! I kept trying to pay for the new <br/>
services via PayPal but for some reason it just won't take my <br/>
money?  Of course, BoxCa$h doesn't appear to be an option for <br/>
currency in PayPal, yet, so until that glitch is fixed, I'll remain <br/>
a free fee participant.  Oh but...do you think I could send a money <br/>
order in BoxCa$h instead?  Please LMK know where to send the money <br/>
and I'll wire it ASAP.  <br/>
<br/>
I just can't wait to start seeking out the 2,000+ newly minted <br/>
hybrids within the 50 mile radius of my home!  Wow!  What prospects <br/>
for those boring, lazy dog days of spring &amp; summer.  We'll be <br/>
boxcaching to eternity!!!  As for tracking the boxcaches--is there a <br/>
database where we can list found/yet to found/missing boxcaches?  I <br/>
just can't wait to start adding my boxcaches to the new dbase any <br/>
longer!!!  <br/>
<br/>
I also am really ecstatic about going back through and modifying all <br/>
of the clues to my 150+ still alive letterboxes (soon to become <br/>
boxcaches) out there.  I guess I'll have to dust off my old Garmin e-<br/>
trex.  Wonder if the batteries still work?  Oh, I guess a few all <br/>
expense paid trips back to the various spots where my 'orphans' are <br/>
located should be in order, too--as I just can't stand the thought <br/>
of owning 'non-compliant' boxcaches out there.  Hmmmm...Hawaii, <br/>
Virginia, Idaho, California, Oregon....what a cool prospect??  <br/>
Perhaps the owners of Boxcaching should think about that--imagine <br/>
the free publicity the sport will get if so many boxcache-placers <br/>
venture off on this new path with such a wonderful 'perk' to kick <br/>
off the transition from classic to new (with nutra-sugarsweet-<br/>
spelenda)!!!  Perhaps boxcaching.com could start their <br/>
own 'travelloccittyyy' site--maybe it could subsidize some of those <br/>
free boxcache maintenance trips???<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, the merger &amp; acquisition of these two hobbies will only <br/>
strengthen the ties of friendship between the various communities.  <br/>
I can only imagine the ensuing flamewars that are yet to occur--<br/>
especially in light of the ones we've witnessed among folks who <br/>
share similar passions for letterboxing!  Imagining the global <br/>
fireworks now!!!  Ooooohhh, ahhhhhhh, oooooohhh, ahhhhhh!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your poisson ala Pike Place Fish Market!!!  ;)  Thanks for <br/>
such a great laugh!!!<br/>
