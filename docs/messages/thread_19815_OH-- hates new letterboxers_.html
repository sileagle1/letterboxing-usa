I have a question for Southern Ohio boxers:<br/>
Is there a "tree identification" series out there any where? You know,<br/>
perhaps an oak leaf stamp placed by an oak tree, ect.?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I stumbled upon letterboxing nearly a year ago because of a magazine<br/>
&gt; article.  I did not take time to careful read the FAQs or to subscribe to<br/>
&gt; the list and learn first; I read enough to get the basics and set out that<br/>
&gt; night with the family in tow.  I was lucky in that the article I read<br/>
&gt; emphasized the discretion aspect.  Since then, I have become a decent<br/>
&gt; letterboxed and shudder at some of my earlier errors.  I also shudder a<br/>
bit<br/>
&gt; when I read some of the posts from some of the new boxers who have come<br/>
here<br/>
&gt; because of the most recent article--and wonder about those who do not even<br/>
&gt; take the time to join a list such as this.  What havoc are they wreaking?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think this note is a gentle  wake-up call especially in the wake of an<br/>
&gt; article that reached so many people and has generated a lot of<br/>
&gt; interest--and, while some very sincere letterboxers are being introduced<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the hobby, many more will attempt a few boxes then loose interest. These<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; the ones less likely to respect the nuances of letterboxing and  announce<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; everyone on the trail what they are looking for; these are the ones that<br/>
try<br/>
&gt; to get large groups involved before they truly understand and have<br/>
&gt; experienced letterboxing.  These are the people who  plop down next to the<br/>
&gt; hiding spot to stamp in, and then casually rehide the box (I actually<br/>
&gt; thought leaving a corner of the box exposed was a good thing--that it<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; make it easier for the next seeker to find the box!  I am much better<br/>
now!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, if you are serious about the hobby <grin> take this note as intended<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; heed any of the points that apply to you.  If none do, nod wisely and get<br/>
&gt; out there and box!<br/>

&gt; &gt; to hate new players?<br/>

<br/>
I am excited to see a new S. Ohioan--tho I must confess I am in the SW Ohio<br/>
area.  BigGuy and Mr. Bloodhound  kindly let us sneak East to box every now<br/>
and again!  Both are great people--as are BigGuys family.  I am planning a<br/>
trip out your way soon; perhaps we can meet up for an exchange?<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Bloodhound's clues are on the LbNA site.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, there is not a specific series on trees, tho I have come<br/>
across an occasional plant such as you describe.  I personally would enjoy<br/>
such a series as I am striving to learn to distinguish amongst trees now<br/>
that I am out and about in nature  (My first challenge is to accurately<br/>
identify poison ivy tho!)<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to finding some of your boxes eventually, and of course, to<br/>
meeting you on the trail.<br/>
