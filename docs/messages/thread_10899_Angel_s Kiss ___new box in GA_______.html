car that it is hidden in. This is a nighttime excursion, as the only <br/>
way to find it is at night, when Angel is working at the copy shop.<br/>
In Norcross, GA there is a Road named after a very HAPPY EX-PRESIDENT.<br/>
It ends at a road named after a BRIDGE. The two meet at a corner and <br/>
there is a COPY SHOP there. Behind the COPY SHOP look for a BURGUNDY <br/>
SATURN that says ANGEL in the back glass. Next year, the tag of the <br/>
car will be ANGELYN. Under the bumper the box is velcroed. Be gentle, <br/>
it's a handcarved stamp of my signature logo, hence "Angel's kiss."<br/>
I will keep purple ink in the box for you, and soon I will have <br/>
notecards for reports. Thanks, and enjoy your adventure!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS if you should happen to find it during the day, I'm thinking of <br/>
employing a daytime stamp :)<br/>

Check out Mapquest, more of a hint would be cheating<br/>
the riddle's easy once you see the streetnames<br/>
Have fun at the wedding and happy adventuring!<br/>
