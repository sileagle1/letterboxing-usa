                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello. I was wondering if anyone has found Sandy's Box in Greenland, <br/>
NH or Portsmouth Harbor Light in Newcastle, NH recently? I searched <br/>
the talk list archives and couldn't find anything at all about Sandy's <br/>
Box (unclaimed) and found a post where someone said they didn't find <br/>
Portsmouth Harbor Light in July (sent e-mail to placer, but I haven't <br/>
heard back). Any news would be helpful as my husband and I are hoping <br/>
to do some letterboxing in that area this weekend. Thanks!<br/>
