Well,  I don't hate geocachers ... especially since I enjoy that hobby  too.  BUT some die-hard geocachers in the St. Louis area have been very difficult to get along with too.  I suspect a few of the "meaner" ones have even sabotaged my kids boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Others though are very nice and I enjoy running into them along the trail occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
While in South Dakota we hunted for some geocaches hid by Team Family Affair that were awesome AND the members of the team were extremely helpful when one of our letterboxes went under the weather.  Their Presidentail View Cache near Mount Rushmore is well worth the search!
