Park will be closed for hunting until Friday, October 25.  <br/>
<br/>
The first box we placed in the park is still accessible but you will <br/>
not be able to get box 2 until that portion of the park reopens.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you planning to place boxes in the park, you may want to <br/>
hold off until the wildlife management folks (aka hunters) are out of <br/>
the area.<br/>
