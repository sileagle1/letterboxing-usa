The Forest Frogs all headed out Saturday to get the "Here Comes the Sun" letterbox in Gaithersburg, Md.  It was early evening, so not too hot, and we had almost made it to the end of the clues when we stumbled into a tough spot.  We were near the bank of Seneca Creek when the trail seemed to take a sharp right turn down an incredibly steep hill.  (Too steep for 5-year-old Ethan (Big Brother Frog) to go down, or me with the baby in the carrier.)  Just to the left of this turn was a blazed tree, and the direction of the blaze suggested that the trail should progess forwards, not to the right, but straight ahead was a huge bush.  Neil (Dad Frog) tried to push aside the branches of the bush but could not see any way to pass through, so he went down the steep hill about 15-20 feet, then followed the path off to the right until we realized that our next clue was a blazed tree near the water's edge, and there were no trees at all in this direction.<br/>
<br/>
So I passed the baby to Dad and attempted to get around this big bush by tromping through thick branches off the trail, holding on to said branches to keep my balance on the incline.  After about 5-10 minutes I eventually got around to discover that the bush was actually a rather large downed tree completely blocking the trail.  So I managed to get back to the trail past the obstacle, found the letterbox, and even managed to take an easier way straight across the hill to bring the box back to where the family was waiting (less scrapes on the legs on the return trip!)  The whole solo trip probably took 20 minutes or so.<br/>
<br/>
Still with me?  As I emerged from the trees, extremely proud of myself for the extra effort I took to find this box, I did my best impression of Ana Gastayer of SNL imitating Celine Dion by saying, "I..am the greatest letterboxer..in the world!" <br/>
<br/>
At almost precisely that moment, a bee stung my left arm, and I swung my hand at it.  Out of the corner of my eye I could see the letterbox sliding...all...the...way...down that original steep hill!!!  Neil: "Tell me you didn't just do what I think you just did!"  Me: "Yup."<br/>
<br/>
So I scampered down the hill, could not see the box (which didn't have the courtesy to turn right with the trail) and headed on my rear end in a semi-controlled slide down through more brush to find the box resting just short of the creek (whew!)  I couldn't get up the same way, so I climbed the hill where I could, placing the letterbox in my large shorts pocket since I needed both hands for climbing.  I finally made it back up to the family...and no box.  It had fallen out of my pocket and BACK down the hill AGAIN, and I didn't even hear it this time!<br/>
<br/>
After that, it all ends well.  The box didn't fall so far the second time, I secured it in my waistband on the return trip up (and checked it every 5 seconds) and eventually stamped and returned the box to its original location.  I debated this last move, but I am hopeful that eventually the trail will be cleared, and I would hate for someone else to go through all this and not find the box there!  Other than having to then change a poopy baby diaper in the woods and it being dusk by the time we returned to the car, the rest of the hike was rather uneventful!<br/>
<br/>
If you're still here, thanks for reading!  I just had to share with people who would understand why I didn't just quit and turn around!!!!!!!<br/>

I can sympathize with the "Not turning back" and appreciate it as well... The only time I turn back is when I can not decipher the clues at all. (grin) Which happens sometimes.  Ok, more than sometimes, but that usually means I go home and rework the clues after having seen the trail.<br/>
<br/>
We've not had any very storytelling adventures yet, but some day, I hope we will. (smiles)<br/>

for going above and beyond the call of duty in Letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
Do we have one of those awards? Anyone want to create a stamp for that? I'm a <br/>
new carver but if we don't have a volunteer to create a stamp and send to <br/>
her, then I will create one. You have to be a die hard Letterboxer to go through <br/>
what she did! It deserves some kind of recognition. <br/>

Thanks for this update on Here Comes the Sun. I have been <br/>
planning to search for it and would likely have several of the kids <br/>
in tow, so better for us to wait!<br/>
