have tried contacting the owner, but haven't heard back.<br/>
<br/>
We are heading up to WY in a few weeks to see my brother and figured we<br/>
would try these boxes while were are there...<br/>
<br/>
BUT - here is what I need to know - are the boxes still there (this is<br/>
going to be our first time out, I don't want the kids to get discouraged<br/>
by not finding a box)?  Is the trail kid-friendly (I have a 1 yr old, a<br/>
2 yr old and a 12 yr old)?  And, lastly, does anyone know how long,<br/>
steep, etc the hike is?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
