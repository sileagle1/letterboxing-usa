website and enter them?  They are good thoughts, especially the whistle...which<br/>
will help if you are out where others can find you.   When we do remember to<br/>
take our cell phone, we check it periodically while out to see where we do and<br/>
don't get reception, its good to know!<br/>

old is a pleasure again and my 20 and 21 year olds are up for<br/>
adoption. Want 'em?"<br/>
<br/>
*laughs* Can I take the 26 year old instead? And will they babysit??  Can I get<br/>
THEM to take the BEA Teenagers out on letterboxing jaunts? *Smiles*<br/>
<br/>
Don and Lucy, cute comments!  And I just learned about beignets this year during<br/>
Mardi Gras season.  My wife was the Queen of Mardi Gras for Central Coast<br/>
California and I ate so many beignets during the season that I thought I was<br/>
gonna' blow! :)<br/>
