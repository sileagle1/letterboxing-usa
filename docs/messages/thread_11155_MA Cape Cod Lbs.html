Hi,<br/>
We were there a week and a half ago and couldn't find "Three<br/>
Women Singing". Nice little lighthouses, though.  Does<br/>
anyone know if they are cottages or what the deal is with<br/>
them?<br/>

As far as I know, "The Three Sisters" letterbox is the one to search<br/>
for now -- it was definitely in place this fall (end of October).  The<br/>
"Three Women Singing" was replaced by The Three Sisters some time ago.<br/>
   I don't know why both sets of clues are still listed, as<br/>
Lonemasswolf replaced the box in 2001.<br/>

We searched for this box a couple weeks ago and were unable to locate <br/>
it . I would assume that it is and was there but the " faint trail " <br/>
was basically invisible after only a few feet into the woods . We <br/>
blundered around in a generally northern direction for the required <br/>
paces but found nothing to match the clues . We will definitely go <br/>
back for this one . Also I want to say Thanks to " fahy bygate " for <br/>
the info on the Three Sisters because I spent many a summer in my <br/>
younger years right in Orleans and never even heard of these <br/>
lighthouses .<br/>
