Planted by Leader of the Pack<br/>
<br/>
Rated easy: be sure to do Peep Study, Round a Drumlin, Uconn Mascot <br/>
and Dendrology 101 when visiting campus<br/>
<br/>
planted  9/29/02<br/>
<br/>
    From rte 195 that divides the Uconn campus turn onto Horsebarn <br/>
Hill Rd. near the light and brick congregational church. It is horse <br/>
shoe shaped rd. So if you get on by the poultry coops drive around to <br/>
the other side.  Park by the Uconn Horse barn ( open for visitors 10-<br/>
4) After visiting the horses pursue your box.<br/>
<br/>
   On April 24 ,1985 Delmaytion Desire layed down in the deep straw <br/>
of her stall and gave birth to a chestnut colt. The new foal on <br/>
spindly legs took his first steps in that stall at the end of the <br/>
aisle at the Uconn horse barn. His father was Ringmaster and master <br/>
of the show ring he was, so it ws a proud lineage that produced this <br/>
newest colt at the barn. His coppery coat  was punctuated by the <br/>
white diamond snip on his nose and the spirited colt was strong and <br/>
healthy.  A year later he was gelded to become a saddle horse and at <br/>
2 entered the training classes at the University. Students trained <br/>
him in their couse work to drive a cart then to ride. He was <br/>
accepting of his work and went right into the string of horses used <br/>
regularly and favored by the students as  a good ride. <br/>
   At the age of 6 Daybreak was sold to a young girl and a new life <br/>
was on the horizon. 4-H camp and horse shows , English jumping and <br/>
western trail rides Daybreak did it all and was happy. Oh.. but <br/>
little girls grow up and become busy with college then work and <br/>
Daybreak waited. Then the news that special girl had to move to <br/>
Australia! What would become of Daybreak?  Well this is a happy <br/>
ending story he is leased to a 4-H boy right here in Mansfield and <br/>
has returned to his hometown after all these years . Now plans and <br/>
dreams of 4-H camp with horses and of jumping and of trail rides and <br/>
all the kids bringing carrots. Life is good  to a horse named <br/>
U.C.Daybreak. <br/>
      To find Daybreak's box take out your compass walk or drive east <br/>
toward the sunrise. See the new horse arena on your left you can park <br/>
there if you drove.  Set your sights east again and look for a picnic <br/>
area. Cross the bridge and again set your compass east toward <br/>
Daybreak. at this point take as many paces as Daybreak is  years old <br/>
in 2002.  This brings you to a home for the Daybreak box. Please <br/>
stamp and sign in , enjoy a picnic table how often do we have this <br/>
luxury! Close the box lid tightly before replacing. Then COVER WELL <br/>
WITH STONE STICKS AND LEAVES TO HIDE IT!  this is a very busy campus. <br/>
