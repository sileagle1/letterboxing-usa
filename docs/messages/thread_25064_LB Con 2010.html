Does anyone know where the con will be in 2010, or when that may be announced so that we can start planning ahead in the event it's not close.<br/>

OK, so I know it's early to start thinking about 2010 but hubby was laid off in March and nothing is really looking prospective yet. I hate to miss the 2009 LB Con in St Louis in fear that it wont be as central next year but I just don't see how we can make it this year. <br/>
