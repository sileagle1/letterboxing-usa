Waterbird.  I planted a new box but I'm waiting until we are closer to <br/>
the event to post the clues - keep your eyes open for this one.  Be <br/>
sure to bring all the clues with you.  <br/>
<br/>
For those of you not familiar with Riverbend Park, here are the <br/>
directions to get there:<br/>
<br/>
Riverbend Park may be reached by taking Beltway Exit 44 which is <br/>
Georgetown Pike west to a right on Riverbend Road (about 4.5 miles, <br/>
first street after the stoplight into Great Falls Park). From <br/>
Riverbend Road turn right on Jeffery Road and follow for approximately <br/>
1 mile to the park entrance. <br/>
<br/>
We are all bringing food to share.  We have had some promises:  BeMa <br/>
is making her Trailer Trash macaroni salad.  I've had the privilege of <br/>
testing it and it's very tasty.  But when I had it she made it with <br/>
farafelle which is pretty upscale for Trailer Trash so she may need to <br/>
find a new name for that dish.  :) Psychomommy says she will make her <br/>
famous lemon pound cake.  I don't remember if this is what she brought <br/>
to the Richmond gathering so I can't give any review of this cake but <br/>
I can tell you that she makes a fabulous cheesecake so I have every <br/>
expectation that the pound cake will be great.  <br/>
<br/>
It promises to be a fun time - great boxes, great food, and most of <br/>
all the greatest people.  <br/>
<br/>
See everyone on the 31st.<br/>
<br/>
Mary<br/>

&gt; Yes, there are grills there.  Are people grilling?  We didn't when <br/>
&gt; we met in Richmond (everyone brought cold food), but if someone will <br/>
&gt; start up a fire, I'm happy to throw something on too.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The excitement is building!  I can't wait to meet everyone.<br/>

Hello, Mary, hello everyone!  I don't know if I remembered to do this (lot <br/>
going on lately!) but I was thinking that we could meet at the picnic area <br/>
nearest the boat launch.  I'm going early to stake it out and defend it for <br/>
us.  Gaabriel aka Mother of Crickets<br/>

&gt; Is there a special stamp for those who travel the farthest?  The Alphabet <br/>

&gt; that are close are CT and MA (close is relative) and we have 2 weddings AND <br/>
&gt; a graduation that weekend!!! and Bucks County PA and Camp starts the next <br/>
&gt; Monday!<br/>
