All right, folks!<br/>
<br/>
Here's something I haven't seen done before: a PREVIEW of a new <br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Ready? Cool! Here goes:<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow (Sunday, Oct 3), just after high noon, we will be planting <br/>
our third letterbox. It will be located in Peachtree City, Georgia.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to be in the First Finder Contest, we welcome you to <br/>
make an attempt after, say, 2pm. The First Finder will WIN A SPECIAL <br/>
PRIZE*!<br/>
<br/>
* I'm serious, folks. It won't be something tooky, either, like a <br/>
sticker or a funny email or something. And I'm not going to make you <br/>
buy anything. You (and especially your kids, if you have any) will <br/>
really enjoy it. All you have to do is: when you stamp in, note the <br/>
TIME you arrived. Make a note of my email address, and when you get <br/>
home, send me a message that you visited the box. Just describe your <br/>
stamp so I can verify it was really you. I'm going to check the <br/>
letterbox 24 hours later to verify the winner, and I'll reply to the <br/>
winner with instructions on how to claim your prize. I'll tell you <br/>
what it is, too!<br/>
<br/>
Now, I can't tell you exactly where the box will be yet, because the <br/>
clues are not yet finished. Check back first thing tomorrow morning, <br/>
either here or on http://www.letterboxing.org. <br/>
<br/>
You can, however, learn about the "atmosphere" of the letterbox by <br/>
visiting these two sites:<br/>

Aren't you excited?!<br/>
