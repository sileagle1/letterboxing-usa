Attention Birders! An Ardea herodias was sighted nesting at the riverside base of a very large Sycamore tree in the center of the Indian Flats camp up river where the Monoacy River joins the Potomac.<br/>

Operation Free Bird Letterbox<br/>

During WWI there were lots of clandestine activities in the United States. Robert Byrd had valuable information and an attempt to capture him and transport him to a foreign destination was in place. The Post was leaked clues about the transport of Byrd, who was being held hostage in WV.  The story goes that the kidnappers communicated thru drop off points and one was discovered in Rock Creek Park containing the following message. "Nolan will take Byrd across river from Virginia into Maryland. Stone pillar closest to river. South. 7 up between 3 left and 3 right for instructions. Wait for signal." As you all know Byrd was never released and the drop off point was never found. Maybe you can find it and help release Robert Byrd.<br/>
