A bike/jogging path runs along the back side of the dunes for most of the length of the beach.<span>   </span>The newly built boardwalk starts at the old Pavilion and continues to the snack hut past West Beach.</p> <p><span>  </span></p> <p>The two boxes are at opposite ends of the beach: you can choose your own route –</p> <p>and don’t miss the Drewclan’s Meigs Point box while you are here.</p> <p> <o:p></o:p></p> <p>The boxes were made in honor of Russ, my “main man” for over 30 years, and placed in Hammonasset State Park, one of our favorite places at home. They commemorate two of our favorite places away from home – Marco Island Florida, a real beach-walker’s paradise and Maine, especially Acadia, for the hiking, gorgeous scenery, fresh air and yes, LOBSTERS!</p> <p> <o:p></o:p></p> <p> <o:p></o:p></p> <p>Make your way to the Camp Store at the western end of the beach. Stand at the beginning of the boardwalk going out to the beach from the camp store.<span>  </span>(We like to rollerblade through the campgrounds in the off-season, and always come to this spot for the view of Faulkner’s Island.) While facing Faulkner’s, notice a sandy path to your right, behind the dunes. Follow it a short ways to the lone pine on the back side of the dune.<span>  </span>“Marco Man” is beneath the small rock 3 feet from the pine on its west side. It is a few steps off the path that goes over the dune. PLEASE tread carefully so as not to disturb the grasses on the dune.<span>  </span>Please rehide carefully.</p> <p> <o:p></o:p></p> <p>Now head “downeast” to find Maine Man. You can walk the beach, try out the new splinter-free boardwalk and say hello/goodbye to the old Pavilion (slated for demolition, to be replaced by a welcome center and handicap accessible playground). Take the bike path, do some bird watching, check out the Nature Center (in season).<span>  </span></p> <p>At the very end of the beach past the Meigs Point Bathhouse pick up the Moraine Trail. Follow it past #8, down the steps and eastward across the rocky beach. Cross the tidal stream and pick up the path again going up the little knoll. (This section of the trail going out to the point becomes almost overgrown in late summer.) Continue along for several minutes. When you see a smooth rock opening to the water with a tall cedar tree ~20 paces ahead on the trail, stop and notice a large boulder that looks like a turtle’s head. Make your way down the smooth rock and over boulders towards turtlehead. Just before reaching it, look left towards the trail and notice two flat topped rocks. Maine Man hides from the waves and gulls under the right-hand flat top rock.<span>  </span>Please barricade him safely after stamping. Enjoy the scenery as you make your way back to your car. Occasionally, there are seals sunning themselves along this section.</p> <p> <o:p></o:p></p> <p align="center"><span> </span>Before you set out, please read the <a href="http://letterboxing.org/ca/waiver.htm">waiver of responsibility and disclaimer</a>.</p> <p align="center"><a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/lbna/america.htm">USA Map</a></p><span><a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/">LBNA Home</a></span><br/><br/></div></body></html>
