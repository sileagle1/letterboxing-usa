<br/>
"I will still be the same person I always have been. I hope to be an <br/>
inspiration to all the little people, the new letterboxers, out <br/>
there. Of course, finding 100 boxes is not just an accomplishment of <br/>
mine; rather, I want everyone - those without 100 finds - to rejoice <br/>
in the triumph of the human spirit that my finds represent. There <br/>
were those people who planted the boxes, no matter how modest, and <br/>
the car driver (whatzhisname?) who took me to a very few places... <br/>
However, I would like to most thank my parents who stayed out of my <br/>
way in rearing me, my teachers whom I taught, the rat Scabbers who <br/>
was my 100th find and ...AAAACKKKKKKK!!!!!"<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Ash Raven and I had to strangle her: it was a mercy killing.<br/>
<br/>
In all seriousness, CONGRATS! MS. JugglerMouse on your 100th Find! It <br/>
was very appropriately the familiar Scabbers (the rat) from the Harry <br/>
Potter series by GSD that was her big century of find. <br/>
<br/>
She started in February 2003 and was the one who started Googled from <br/>
her boss's discovery of Ryan Carpenter's Bookstore stamp. She told <br/>
Emily Rose, two out of state folk, and me. She has become our best <br/>
stamp carver and a tireless booklet maker. She has done more to make <br/>
our October 4th Event in SLO, CA, the success it will surely be than <br/>
anyone else. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, she juggles, and teaches how to also.<br/>
<br/>
Proud to be her teammate, best/boy friend, and occasional chauffer, <br/>

<br/>
You're very right to be suspicious, Wild Woman.  Sir Balthazar, while <br/>
I'm sure he did his faithful best to record the immortal words I had <br/>
prepared for the occasion, shortened my speech considerably.  I <br/>
thanked many more people, and used turns of speech and sentiments so <br/>
infused with modesty and good will that, if I were immodest enough to <br/>
reprint them here for you, or if my companions had had the simple <br/>
foresight to have pen them down as I spoke, I am sure you would be <br/>
even more overcome than you report yourself being from Sir B's simple <br/>
abbreviated paraphrase.<br/>
<br/>
In truth, Sir Balthazar and AshRaven are the very best of people to <br/>
hunt boxes with, and I am very lucky to have them, and very lucky <br/>
that they put up with me as they do.  I am a very happy mouse indeed.<br/>
