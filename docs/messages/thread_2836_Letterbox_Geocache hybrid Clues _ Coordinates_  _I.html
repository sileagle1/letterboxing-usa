                    <div class="plaintext-content">Walk through the old quarry -- good place for a dog run -- follow one of <br/>
the trails up<br/>
into the woods and down to the water.  This involves a few hundred feet of <br/>
woods.<br/>
<br/>
Continue to the west until you're on the northwest end.  Look for a tree <br/>
beside a gully a<br/>
couple of feet thick and fallen from about 3 metres high.  In it you'll <br/>
find my Geocache.<br/>
Inside the 12 litre black bucket with a white lid you'll find typical <br/>
Geocaching prizes<br/>
-- take something and leave something -- and a stamp attached by a string <br/>
to the lid.<br/>
<br/>
Please place the cache back in the tree using a stick with a 'Y' in it.<br/>

Iced Tea 1<br/>
<br/>
by Donald Buchan<br/>
N 45 52.014 W 074 33.503 (WGS-84)<br/>
in Quebec, Canada<br/>
Hidden on: 7/7/2001<br/>
Use Waypoint: GCFA0<br/>
<br/>
(ratings out of 5 stars)<br/>
Difficulty: 1.5  Terrain: 1<br/>
<br/>
Elevation 253 metres, 8.2 metres average accuracy on coordinates.<br/>
<br/>
This is near my cottage on Lake Harrington, Harrington, Quebec. About an <br/>
hour and a half<br/>
northwest of Montreal, Quebec, two hours northeast of Ottawa, Ontario.<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox hybrid. Right now that means that I've added a personal stamp <br/>
identifying the<br/>
cache. You WILL need to bring your own inkpad!<br/>
<br/>
Child and dog friendly terrain. If they don't mind a few hundred feet of <br/>
terrain with<br/>
fallen trees here and there. :) Also a good dog run area nearby.<br/>
<br/>
The body of water you'll see is actually a pond beside our lake -- a land <br/>
bridge about 5<br/>
feet wide separate them, so they only share a water table. Lots of minnows. <br/>
At various<br/>
points in the pond the silt level rises to the surface of the water!<br/>
<br/>
Full postal services, fax service, phone service, milk, fresh fruit &amp; <br/>
vegetables,<br/>
Montreal and Ottawa newspapers, etc. are available at the convenience store <br/>
in Lost River<br/>
for road trippers.<br/>
<br/>
My raw data readings are available at www.malak.ca. There is also a <br/>
downloadable text on<br/>
the local attractions such as a B&amp;B and excellent steakhouse in the area. A <br/>
copy of the<br/>
attractions sheet is in the cache.<br/>
<br/>
Initial prizes:<br/>
<br/>
3 packs each of 2 varieties of firestarters<br/>
1 pack of cards<br/>
5 AOL CD's<br/>
1 "CoCo Joe" carving to put on your wall<br/>
<br/>
Don't look for any Iced Tea. Despite being a personal trademark, I figured <br/>
the liquid<br/>
form would freeze in the winter, and the powdered form would attract <br/>
animals. :)<br/>
<br/>
Decrypted hint below:<br/>
<br/>
Take route 327 and turn onto the road for Lake Harrington.<br/>
<br/>
Parking at: N45 52.092 W 074 33.6182<br/>
<br/>
Bring a walking stick with a hook or natural 'Y' to take the black plastic <br/>
12 litre tub<br/>
with a white top out of its tree. And please place it back there when <br/>
finished. :) Or use<br/>
a stick. Hence the 1.5 rating. :)<br/>
