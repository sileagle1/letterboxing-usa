                    <div class="plaintext-content">A letterbox was planted in Staunton River State Park in Scottsburg, <br/>
VA, on October 10, 2002, by mlgainey. The closest town is Scottsburg, <br/>
and the county that you could say Scottsburg is in (if Virginia did <br/>
its counties like the rest of the country) is Halifax. The largest <br/>
cities to Scottsburg are South Boston and Danville.<br/>
<br/>
On weekdays, park admission is $2. On weekends and holidays, it is $3.<br/>
<br/>
Because this box is an orphan, please drop mlgainey a note about its <br/>
condition at mlgainey@yahoo.com. This box does not contain a pencil.<br/>
<br/>
Once inside the park, park in the lot near the playgrounds, the pool, <br/>
and the tennis courts.<br/>
<br/>
Take the Tutelo Trail.<br/>
<br/>
At the picinic area, walk toward the shelter.<br/>
<br/>
Walk behind the shelter.<br/>
<br/>
Pick up the River Bank Trail.<br/>
<br/>
At the bottom of the first small hill that you walk down are areas of <br/>
fallen trees on both sides of the trail.<br/>
<br/>
The box is hidden in the fallen tree closest to the path on the right <br/>
side of the trail. The box is covered with bark inside the tree. <br/>
Please recover with bark.<br/>
