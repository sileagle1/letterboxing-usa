                    <div class="plaintext-content">I finally made it to the state forest where you all had the <br/>
gathering.  What a fun place!  Quickly found Spring Peeper of <br/>
Ruggle's Pond, Off She Visits, and El Corazon!  "The elephant in a <br/>
hat" took patience on my part as the sun was going down!  After this <br/>
one Vincent was a breeze.  Mosquitoes everywhere here!<br/>
<br/>
The ranger was rushing me as I began at 3 pm and they were closing at <br/>
4.  I got the first 2 completed with time to spare!!! Parked outside <br/>
and then walked back in for the remaining 3.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I did not print out any newer ones...mainly because I <br/>
need a new journal (Stands up and cheers!! Ole'!!! sits down again)<br/>
<br/>
There was time in the day to rush to the Cemetary in West Hampton and <br/>
stamp in!!!<br/>
<br/>
Giving me a total of 9 for the day...earlier stoppping at the Bray <br/>
Loop for 3 but only found 2. (is Metamorphosis  #2 still missing?) <br/>

Forest in MA--the stamp for the Saint Exupery box needs <br/>
recarving.  The boa constrictor swallowing an elephant lost his <br/>
head after some vigorous stamping in at the MA gathering there!<br/>
<br/>
I think I made a note already on the clue page, but if not I'll do so <br/>
shortly.  Hope to get the new stamp there pretty soon.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear you liked Wendell.<br/>
