<br/>
My daughter, Wild Child, and I have a layover in Cincinnati on Tues, June 17. <br/>
 We'll arrive around 3:30 and will be in your fair airport until 5:30.  <br/>
Needless to say, I'm hoping this might be an opportunity to do some Cincinnati <br/>
boxing!  I see that there are LOTS of boxes in this part of Ohio, but I have no <br/>
idea which ones might be close to the airport.  Can anyone out there enlighten <br/>
me?  (If you have any bus suggestions from the airport, that would be helpful <br/>
too, tho I can work on that on my own.)  We have a similar layover on Monday <br/>
June 30, from 1:00-3:00.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any suggestions you might have!!!<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">i would try the union terminal box. it's fairly close and right off <br/>
of I-74 AND very easy to find.  but you may want to look at northern <br/>
ky boxes as well, since that's where the airport is actually located.<br/>
<br/>
good luck!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Think Covington, Kentucky--there are a handful of quick boxes <br/>
there.  Not sure if 2 hours in the region is enough to get out of <br/>
the airport and back to ensure you catch your connection.  I think <br/>
Kentucky Crab (or some name like that) would be a quick find <br/>
relatively near the airport.<br/>
