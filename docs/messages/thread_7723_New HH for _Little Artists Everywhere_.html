places to box on Saturday.  While we were out we left our new hitch <br/>
hiker "Little Artists everywhere" in a great park!<br/>
<br/>
As we (the ADG) have been out hunting letterboxes I have been struck <br/>
by how great it is to find little works of art in the most unexpected <br/>
places.  So this HH is a tribute to all the little artists everywhere <br/>
who make this so much fun.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you find it in a box you uncover soon!<br/>
