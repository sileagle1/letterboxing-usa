                    <div class="plaintext-content">Is anyone planning to carve an event stamp for this?  We have never <br/>
been there, so don't know the area, but we're planning on going.  If <br/>
someone would like to adopt a box to plant in the park, I would be <br/>
willing to carve a stamp, and put a box together. Maybe someone knows <br/>
a good place to have a table available for stamping.It sounds like <br/>
there will be food and stuff available, so putting a gather together <br/>
would be redundant,but...a place to gather and a stamp to collect???? <br/>
Let me know@ njks919@aol.com--- Sunshine :0)<br/>
