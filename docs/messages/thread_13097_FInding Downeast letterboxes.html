                    <div class="plaintext-content">Help!  I'm a basic computer user and just getting into letterboxing.  When I first went to the map site for downeast Maine there were a number of letterboxes listed. In fact I printed  the Cadillac Mountain Letterbox Info. But now I cannot get back to that page nor can I fing the others letterboxes that I saw listed for that area.  Does anyone know if these letterboxes have been removed?  Can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong?               Thank You,  Downeaster<br/>
