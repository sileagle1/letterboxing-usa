<br/>
However, the New England Hiking Group does have a disclaimer...here it is: <br/>
<br/>
DISCLAIMER<br/>
<br/>
The New England Hiking Group is a group of people interested in becoming involved in outdoor<br/>
activities in our area. But, of course, certain activities can be dangerous, and there is the<br/>
possibility that you can be injured. No one in the Group can or will be held liable for any<br/>
injury or any financial or other loss which may occur during a group activity. It's best for you to<br/>
evaluate your abilities and physical condition before participating in any outdoor activity, be it<br/>
with the Group or on your own!<br/>
<br/>

Do we have any lawyers in our group?<br/>

I think your concerns have been pretty well addressed in the waiver<br/>
statement - by using the clues posted, one accepts responsibility for<br/>
their actions. and,risks arew described only in general terms. Specific<br/>
risks are <not> enumerated, as by implication, any accident caused by a<br/>
non-enumerated eventuality would not have been warned against, etc. <br/>
<br/>
&gt;From the waiver statement:<br/>
&gt; By reading and utilizing the letterbox clues posted on this web site, you acknowledge the above conditions,and accept responsibility for your own actions, and agree to hold non-liable the clubs and clue writers, and<br/>
&gt;further, agree to provide this disclaimer to any person with whom you share these letterbox clues. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
At one point, the waiver was placed in such a way that you couldn't get<br/>
to a clue without the waiver showing up first. Now, at least on some<br/>
clue pages, one has to make another effort to call up the waiver - some<br/>
slick lawyer might be able to use that as an opening. However, all in<br/>
all, I feel we are covered pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yea, I am NOT a lawyer (I'm an architect, with a weather eye to<br/>
risks!).<br/>
