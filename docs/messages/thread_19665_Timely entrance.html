<br/>
Oh well here goes.  For those of your back East and other heavily "boxed" places it's a little easier to feel like this should stay "small."  You can practically walk down the street and trip over a box. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand in the Midwest we don't have very many choices.  We really want to encourage this hobby to grow.  It's the only way we're going to have boxes to look for.<br/>
<br/>
So, leave the Newbies alone and quit alienating them (lol).<br/>

    I had the same thought.  Maybe we can form a newbie brigade, where we<br/>
can band together without worrying about offending someone with our<br/>
presence.<br/>
    I too am a Time newbie.  I too was extremely excited when I realized<br/>
this entire hobby existed out there, and I made a mad dash for the store and<br/>
bought all the things I'd need.  Ruined a few erasers and finally got myself<br/>
out on the trails.  I spent a happy weekend almost fully engaged with<br/>
letterboxing, and have plans to plant my first letterbox this week.  In<br/>
fact, I've already made plans for a multi-box series dealing with the ghosts<br/>
of Washington DC.  <br/>
    I was so excited that I joined the mailing lists right away, where I was<br/>
pretty surprised to see the amount of vitriol that flies for what seemed to<br/>
me to be a pastime about the people you meet (either in person or through a<br/>
log book).  And I just as quickly learned to keep my mouth shut on the<br/>
mailing lists.  So I asked no questions -- in fact, I briefly considered<br/>
just de-subscribing.  Instead, I joined the newboxers list, where people<br/>
seemed glad to see me.  <br/>
    I can understand that part of this pastime is secrecy.  I can even see<br/>
how an influx of newcomers unfamiliar with the pitfalls of the hobby (like<br/>
being too obvious so that boxes end up going up missing) can impact it in a<br/>
negative way.  But is this really the way to treat people who could become<br/>
just as enthusiastic -- and informed -- as the next person?  I understand<br/>
the desire to keep a clubby hobby clubby.  But now that we're here, is it<br/>
really the right message to send to people eager to be included?  No hobby,<br/>
no sport, no activity of any kind, can survive without an influx of new<br/>
blood to deflect attrition.  It's just the way things are.  So now that<br/>
we're here, I for one would welcome some hospitality.  I hope I haven't<br/>
offended anyone, but this is how I feel.<br/>

FYI- watch where you box in DC... there has been some talk of FBI <br/>
involvement with the post-9/11 security.  I'm sure some DC boxers <br/>
can give you more detail but I do know that some boxes have been <br/>
removed there &amp; it's much more difficult to plant in some areas as <br/>
people are obviously leery of mysterious boxes &amp; loitering people.  <br/>
<br/>
Sad for all of us as I hear there were some particularly spectacular <br/>
boxes down there (I think there still are though!).  <br/>
<br/>
Newbies fear not- just use common sense, both when finding &amp; <br/>
planting.  You will be welcomed to the fold but understand that <br/>
people are leery.  Some of the stories &amp; comments that have been <br/>
going around here in the last week or so have been a little hard-to-<br/>
hear for some of the more seasoned boxers I think.  This has been a <br/>
hobby, in the past, which has been passed on to people via word of <br/>
mouth typically- to people you knew were going to "keep the faith" <br/>
as it were &amp; take all the precautions necessary &amp; follow the "rules" <br/>
(even if there aren't any).  It's natural for people to have a <br/>
concern that people are now going to jump in without understanding <br/>
what's involved &amp; how to do it "properly".  Please, PLEASE be the <br/>
best boxers ever &amp; prove us all wrong &amp; we'll gladly accept your <br/>
raspberries &amp; noogies in the end!  :)<br/>

where we<br/>
&gt; can band together without worrying about offending someone with our<br/>
&gt; presence.<br/>
&gt;     I too am a Time newbie.  I too was extremely excited when I <br/>
realized<br/>
&gt; this entire hobby existed out there, and I made a mad dash for the <br/>
store and<br/>
&gt; bought all the things I'd need.  Ruined a few erasers and finally <br/>
got myself<br/>
&gt; out on the trails.  I spent a happy weekend almost fully engaged <br/>
with<br/>
&gt; letterboxing, and have plans to plant my first letterbox this <br/>
week.  In<br/>
&gt; fact, I've already made plans for a multi-box series dealing with <br/>
the ghosts<br/>
&gt; of Washington DC.  <br/>
&gt;     I was so excited that I joined the mailing lists right away, <br/>
where I was<br/>
&gt; pretty surprised to see the amount of vitriol that flies for what <br/>
seemed to<br/>
&gt; me to be a pastime about the people you meet (either in person or <br/>
through a<br/>
&gt; log book).  And I just as quickly learned to keep my mouth shut on <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; mailing lists.  So I asked no questions -- in fact, I briefly <br/>
considered<br/>
&gt; just de-subscribing.  Instead, I joined the newboxers list, where <br/>
people<br/>
&gt; seemed glad to see me.  <br/>
&gt;     I can understand that part of this pastime is secrecy.  I can <br/>
even see<br/>
&gt; how an influx of newcomers unfamiliar with the pitfalls of the <br/>
hobby (like<br/>
&gt; being too obvious so that boxes end up going up missing) can <br/>
impact it in a<br/>
&gt; negative way.  But is this really the way to treat people who <br/>
could become<br/>
&gt; just as enthusiastic -- and informed -- as the next person?  I <br/>
understand<br/>
&gt; the desire to keep a clubby hobby clubby.  But now that we're <br/>
here, is it<br/>
&gt; really the right message to send to people eager to be included?  <br/>
No hobby,<br/>
&gt; no sport, no activity of any kind, can survive without an influx <br/>
of new<br/>
&gt; blood to deflect attrition.  It's just the way things are.  So now <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; we're here, I for one would welcome some hospitality.  I hope I <br/>
haven't<br/>
&gt; offended anyone, but this is how I feel.<br/>

I do understand the concern.  However, If I were going<br/>
to vandalize, and not try to follow the rules, I<br/>
myself would have looked at the list and clues, gone<br/>
and vandalized, and never joined this list and posted.<br/>
  I joined so I COULD be a good letterboxer... it is<br/>
always good to learn the rules before joining a group<br/>
or game.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to find a box in D.C :)  When I visited,<br/>
I loved the place!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Newbies fear not- just use common sense, both when<br/>
&gt; finding &amp; <br/>
&gt; planting.  You will be welcomed to the fold but<br/>
&gt; understand that <br/>
&gt; people are leery.  Some of the stories &amp; comments<br/>
&gt; that have been <br/>
&gt; going around here in the last week or so have been a<br/>
&gt; little hard-to-<br/>
&gt; hear for some of the more seasoned boxers I think. <br/>
&gt; This has been a <br/>
&gt; hobby, in the past, which has been passed on to<br/>
&gt; people via word of <br/>
&gt; mouth typically- to people you knew were going to<br/>
&gt; "keep the faith" <br/>
&gt; as it were &amp; take all the precautions necessary &amp;<br/>
&gt; follow the "rules" <br/>
&gt; (even if there aren't any).  It's natural for people<br/>
&gt; to have a <br/>
&gt; concern that people are now going to jump in without<br/>
&gt; understanding <br/>
&gt; what's involved &amp; how to do it "properly".  Please,<br/>
&gt; PLEASE be the <br/>
&gt; best boxers ever &amp; prove us all wrong &amp; we'll gladly<br/>
&gt; accept your <br/>
&gt; raspberries &amp; noogies in the end!  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;     I had the same thought.  Maybe we can form a<br/>
&gt; newbie brigade, <br/>
&gt; where we<br/>
&gt; &gt; can band together without worrying about offending<br/>
&gt; someone with our<br/>
&gt; &gt; presence.<br/>
&gt; &gt;     I too am a Time newbie.  I too was extremely<br/>
&gt; excited when I <br/>
&gt; realized<br/>
&gt; &gt; this entire hobby existed out there, and I made a<br/>
&gt; mad dash for the <br/>
&gt; store and<br/>
&gt; &gt; bought all the things I'd need.  Ruined a few<br/>
&gt; erasers and finally <br/>
&gt; got myself<br/>
&gt; &gt; out on the trails.  I spent a happy weekend almost<br/>
&gt; fully engaged <br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing, and have plans to plant my first<br/>
&gt; letterbox this <br/>
&gt; week.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; fact, I've already made plans for a multi-box<br/>
&gt; series dealing with <br/>
&gt; the ghosts<br/>
&gt; &gt; of Washington DC.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;     I was so excited that I joined the mailing<br/>
&gt; lists right away, <br/>
&gt; where I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; pretty surprised to see the amount of vitriol that<br/>
&gt; flies for what <br/>
&gt; seemed to<br/>
&gt; &gt; me to be a pastime about the people you meet<br/>
&gt; (either in person or <br/>
&gt; through a<br/>
&gt; &gt; log book).  And I just as quickly learned to keep<br/>
&gt; my mouth shut on <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; mailing lists.  So I asked no questions -- in<br/>
&gt; fact, I briefly <br/>
&gt; considered<br/>
&gt; &gt; just de-subscribing.  Instead, I joined the<br/>
&gt; newboxers list, where <br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; &gt; seemed glad to see me.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;     I can understand that part of this pastime is<br/>
&gt; secrecy.  I can <br/>
&gt; even see<br/>
&gt; &gt; how an influx of newcomers unfamiliar with the<br/>
&gt; pitfalls of the <br/>
&gt; hobby (like<br/>
&gt; &gt; being too obvious so that boxes end up going up<br/>
&gt; missing) can <br/>
&gt; impact it in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; negative way.  But is this really the way to treat<br/>
&gt; people who <br/>
&gt; could become<br/>
&gt; &gt; just as enthusiastic -- and informed -- as the<br/>
&gt; next person?  I <br/>
&gt; understand<br/>
&gt; &gt; the desire to keep a clubby hobby clubby.  But now<br/>
&gt; that we're <br/>
&gt; here, is it<br/>
&gt; &gt; really the right message to send to people eager<br/>
&gt; to be included?  <br/>
&gt; No hobby,<br/>
&gt; &gt; no sport, no activity of any kind, can survive<br/>
&gt; without an influx <br/>
&gt; of new<br/>
&gt; &gt; blood to deflect attrition.  It's just the way<br/>
&gt; things are.  So now <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; we're here, I for one would welcome some<br/>
&gt; hospitality.  I hope I <br/>
&gt; haven't<br/>
&gt; &gt; offended anyone, but this is how I feel.<br/>

    It's just folks who are keenly interested in their perspective of the hobby.  The VAST majority of us are perfectly pleasant.  Sparks often fly when folks read postings without knowing the intended spirit of the message.  One thing can lead to another.  When the posts talk about the art &amp; science of letterboxing, things stay pretty nice.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; Yes, no doubt it is silly, however, like any<br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt;   &gt; family that <br/>
&gt;   &gt; bickers, we can be fiercely loyal and defensive<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt;   &gt; one another when <br/>
&gt;   &gt; provoked by an outsider, therefore making fun of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;   &gt; family feud is <br/>
&gt;   &gt; probably not the best way to win friends.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Furthermore, a lot of people here would rather<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt;   &gt; have seen the Time <br/>
&gt;   &gt; article published, so although we are glad that<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt;   &gt; have made your <br/>
&gt;   &gt; way here, the inference of an "invited guest"<br/>
&gt; may be<br/>
&gt;   &gt; stretching it a <br/>
&gt;   &gt; bit.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt; Holy moly! Looks like the Time article may<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt;   &gt; come out at a <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; bad "time?" I feel like an invited guest who<br/>
&gt;   &gt; arrived right in the <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; middle of a famiy feud. Like most family<br/>
&gt;   &gt; arguments, this one looks <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; kind of silly to an outsider:<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; "You're mean!"<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; "No, you're mean!"<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; "No, you are so mean."<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; "You're the mean one."<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; "I can't believe you said that."<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; "Oh, TLC, you're here!"<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; "Meanie." (grumbles)<br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt; I'm in central New York, where distances are a<br/>
&gt;   &gt; little farther than <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; they look on the map, so I'm still P0 F0 but<br/>
&gt; I'm<br/>
&gt;   &gt; hoping to change <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; that this fall. Thanks for the entertainment!<br/>
&gt; TLC<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   I'm a "Time" article newbie too...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I was really excited about this hobby... I have<br/>
&gt; rubber<br/>
&gt;   stamped for years and years and enjoy walking and<br/>
&gt;   thought this was a great combination of those<br/>
&gt;   interests.. Plus, I could take my dog as much as<br/>
&gt;   possible, and I always love that.  I went out,<br/>
&gt; bought<br/>
&gt;   stuff, ruined a few perfectly good erasers, lined<br/>
&gt; up a<br/>
&gt;   couple friends to do it with...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I didn't read any of the squabble, but this<br/>
&gt; response <br/>
&gt;   surely cools my interest in meeting other<br/>
&gt;   letterboxers.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   "Welcome to letterboxing"... well, not really.<br/>
