                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to Aili and Bruce for a wonderful gathering!!  My husband, "Doc<br/>
Science" and I, "Ginger's Journeys"  really enjoyed the day and having the<br/>
opportunity to put faces with names.<br/>
<br/>
    We thought that everyone had fun cooperating to go off to find a few<br/>
boxes. Thanks to Butterfly Lady for helping us get started in the "Giant".<br/>
It is a truly wonderful place to hike.  I also enjoyed our afternoon of<br/>
accomplishing the climb to the Giant's Chin and to the Giant's Chest.<br/>
Thanks to Pat for not giving up with the Chin clues and to her son, Wesley<br/>
for helping us all.  I  had a lot of fun with Buckaroo and Jennie, too!!<br/>
<br/>
    Seeing so many wonderful handcarved stamps has inspired us both to start<br/>
carving and placing in Massachusetts!<br/>
<br/>
    We found our first letterbox in Dartmoor in 1989 - the Ripon Tor<br/>
Letterbox.  Somewhere in my house in a small notebook, is the image of a<br/>
bull's eye!<br/>
<br/>
    Never did we imagine that twelve years later would we be enjoying this<br/>
wonderful hobby in our country!  Thanks, to all of you who got is started in<br/>
the USA!!!<br/>
<br/>
    Cheers!<br/>
