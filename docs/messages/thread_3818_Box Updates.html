visited within the last month:<br/>
<br/>
The Fledglings Box on MT Pisgah in Northboro MA is <br/>
still there, however the trails have been re-marked <br/>
with new markers. The current instructions requiring <br/>
that you follow red dots will no longer work, the<br/>
red dots have been removed. <br/>
<br/>
The box atop Mt Wachusett (central MA) was not sealed <br/>
properly and the log was soaked through and then<br/>
turned moldy. It is unusable in its current condition.<br/>
<br/>
The Two Hearts Box at Purgatory Chasm in Sutton MA may<br/>
be missing. A thorough search of the area came up with<br/>
empty beer bottles in all hiding places close to the<br/>
area pointed to by the clue. The other three boxes in<br/>
that series are still there. <br/>
<br/>
The Otis Redding and David Crosby boxes in Madison WI <br/>
are missing to the best of my knowledge. A thorough<br/>
serach of the area by a team of four people came up<br/>
with neither box. The woods area has been well turned <br/>
over, many trees were cut down. <br/>
<br/>
The Majestic Theatre box in the center of Madison WI <br/>
is also missing. All of the trees and shrubs that were<br/>
<br/>
on the State House lawn were removed for security <br/>
reasons.<br/>
<br/>
The Aztalan Box in Aztalan WI is missing. The area<br/>
was cleaned of shrubs and many trees. There is nowhere<br/>
to hide a box anywhere near the coordinates given in<br/>
the clue.<br/>
