                    <div class="plaintext-content">This Thanksgiving holiday I had a chance to do some letterboxing with my <br/>
relatives in Grants Pass, OR.  I had introduced them to the sport last <br/>
Spring.  Since that time they have hidden 2 and found one.  (SW Oregon is <br/>
kind of sparse in the Lb arena.)  I want to tell you about one of their <br/>
boxes, cuz I like the story.  Its all about remembering that there are no <br/>
rules:<br/>
<br/>
They placed the Pierce Riffle Letterbox last May.  My Sister-In-Law runs by <br/>
there (literally) about once a week to check on its status.  Her choice was <br/>
to hide it in a big-*ss rubber-made container.  I don't get it, but hey, its <br/>
not my box.  Its size makes it a challenge to hide for sure.  One week <br/>
someone stole the log and stamp.  They threw some of the log sheets around <br/>
saying "This is stupid" and "Someone should clean this place up".  Since then <br/>
the sis-in-law has made it her goal to keep the area free of litter!  She <br/>
replaced the log and had the 12 year old niece make a new stamp.  There must <br/>
be a geo-cache in the area that is hard to find, because people have started <br/>
leaving little trinkets in that big-*ss letterbox container and making notes <br/>
in the log about how happy they are to have finally found the geo-cache.  My <br/>
sis-in-law takes in all in stride.  She's tickled that folks have stopped by <br/>
no matter why.  When I found the box (which I'm calling a half find because <br/>
the nephew who took me there couldn't just let me look, he had to point out <br/>
all the landmarks ahead of me on the trail because he helped hide the box to <br/>
begin with!)  So, when I found the letterbox, I made note of the fact in the <br/>
log that folks were finding a spontaneous (and merged) letterbox/geo-cache, <br/>
not the official geo-cache in that area.  <br/>
<br/>
This is not a grand tale.  Just one about how letterboxes can change.  And, <br/>
how its okay to put them back the  way they were, or in this case, to let it <br/>
change and adapt a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  And I forgot to mention, the other letterbox my relatives and I planted <br/>
in Grants Pass last March was placed on a trail with no name at the Fish <br/>
Hatchery Park.  The family always called it the Horse Trap Trail because of <br/>
some personal family event that made the trail memorable to them.  They even <br/>
called it the Horse Trap Trail letterbox.  Recently my brother was talking to <br/>
a buddy of his about were to go bike riding (or some such thing) and his <br/>
buddy asked if my brother was familiar with the Horse Trap Trail area.  Hah!  <br/>
Can you imagine how funny that would be if 20 years from now they are making <br/>
a map of the area and name that little path the Horse Trap Trail??  We're <br/>
making history, folks!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'll be posting a couple new letterboxes ("Burnt Turkey" and "Wild <br/>
Eyed Things That Peek Through The Limbs") in the Grants Pass, OR area in a <br/>
couple days.  Hope everyone had a wonderful turkey day!<br/>
