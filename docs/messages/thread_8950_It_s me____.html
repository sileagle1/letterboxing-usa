Many thanks for all the encouragement on my 100th find!<br/>
<br/>
And just my two cents... I did not count any of the stamps I got at the East Coast Event as finds.  If I had, I would have been at 100 a while ago!  To me they weren't really finds since I didn't have to look for them - they sort of came to me!  <br/>
