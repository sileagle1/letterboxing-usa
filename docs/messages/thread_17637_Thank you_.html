both here and via email.  To Fisher in CT, I have lived here for 2 <br/>
years now and still ooh and awe over those views.  :D  <br/>
Well, I went on my first hunt last week!  I can see now why you all <br/>
are so addicted. :b  We started out small, taking the Clear Creek <br/>
Trails LB in Silverdale.  It was a short hike, and easy clues, which <br/>
made it fun for the kids to get involved in.  Now they (and me too) <br/>
can't wait to go on our next hunt.  Anyway...thanks again.  I'm glad <br/>
to be a part of this group! <br/>
