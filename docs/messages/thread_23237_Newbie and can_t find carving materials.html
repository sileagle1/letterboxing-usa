Are you in an area that has a art store, as opposed to craft and hobby<br/>
shops?  Around me, places like Hobby Lobby, Joanne's, and Michael's don't<br/>
carry any of the stuff.  But in the town next door to me is Carlson's Art<br/>
Supplies and a couple of towns over is a Blick's Art Supplies.  These are<br/>
the places where the college art students get their stuff and the local fine<br/>
arts artists get their stuff.<br/>
<br/>
So I go to those types of art supply stores for stamp carving supplies, and<br/>
I go to scrapbooking stores for my marker and inkpad supplies.  I found that<br/>
at places like Hobby Lobby and Michael's, the markers and inkpads were<br/>
cheaper but seemed to run dry much quicker.  (Plus I have a lot of other<br/>
card making supplies that I buy that craft and hobby shops don't carry, so I<br/>
just one-stop shop for that stuff.)<br/>
<br/>
But maybe look in your local Yellow Pages under "art supplies" and see if<br/>
any fine art stores pop up.<br/>

I am looking for a website where I can order Speedball carving<br/>
materials and tools.  I have looked in every craft and hobby shop in my<br/>
area and nothing!  This is a new hobby in my area and I think that is<br/>
why I'm having a hard time finding supplies.  If anyone could point me<br/>

in many  stores including Wal-Mart.  Folks have been cutting simpler <br/>
designs in a white piece and then gluing it onto a thicker black piece <br/>
with a total thickness of about 1/2 inch.  I imagine this foam is much <br/>
cheaper then the 'Pink stuff'.  An example of these stamps can be seen <br/>
pre-made for kids.<br/>
