Nisene Marks State Park<br/>
<br/>
Placed September 3, 2001<br/>
<br/>
Aptos, Santa Cruz County, California<br/>
<br/>
The epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake is located in the center of<br/>
Nisene Marks State Park in Aptos, California.  This is the site of the 7.1<br/>
magnitude earthquake that caused extensive damage to the San Francisco and<br/>
Monterey Bay areas including the collapse of the San Francisco Bay Bridge,<br/>
the Cypress structure in Oakland and thousands of buildings.  A number of<br/>
people were killed in the quake.<br/>
<br/>
Enter Nisene Marks State Park in Aptos, California off of Soquel Drive<br/>
through the main entrance.  Drive in to the furthest point possible (during<br/>
winter months, the road is closed closer to the entrance requiring a longer<br/>
walk).  Follow the signs in the park to the epicenter designated by a sign<br/>
on the Aptos Creek trail.<br/>
<br/>
Upon facing the sign, turn 90 degrees to the right; take 23 paces on the<br/>
trail to a hair pin switch back turn in the trail.  Step up the small mound<br/>
toward the broken tree stump (shaken down by the quake).  There is a log<br/>
that fell on the ledge toward the creek.  In the summer time, brush is<br/>
covering the log.<br/>
<br/>
Step over the stump/log to the other side.  The box is under the log on the<br/>
back side three paces toward the creek.<br/>
<br/>
The hike is about two miles from the last parking area open in the summer<br/>
time, longer in the wet months due to lack of dry road access.<br/>
