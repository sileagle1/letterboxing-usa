<br/>
As my wife, her brother, our son, and I were out looking for boxes <br/>
today, we came across 2 hitchhikers in Virginia Beach. <br/>
<br/>
Golden Dragon's Destiny was located at the Edgar Cayce Foundation's <br/>
Gardens. Beautiful stamp. I am curious to know where it was started <br/>
from. <br/>
<br/>
Seeker's Delight was found in First Landing State Park off of the <br/>
Long Creek trail, and we were excited to be the first to use its <br/>
stamp. It'll be a bit before we can place it elsewhere, but rest <br/>
assured, it will not be in our possession for long. <br/>
<br/>
Not bad for a group that's only been letterboxing for less than a <br/>
week.<br/>

I believe, but I didn't plant it.  I tried to email<br/>
the address left in the log to see if they were<br/>
successful in gaining my Garden Gnome in the same park<br/>
because he came up missing about that time, but I<br/>
received back a notice saying that the address wasn't<br/>
accepting emails.  Let me know if you are more<br/>
successful as I am curious about the time the Gnome<br/>
went off traveling again.  <br/>
<br/>
At the time I almost expected the HH to be from one of<br/>
my students as I take every opportunity to try to get<br/>
teens interested in this wholesome hobby, but none<br/>
told me that it belonged to them.  :o)<br/>
