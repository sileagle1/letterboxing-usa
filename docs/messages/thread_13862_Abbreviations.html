V is Virtual - these are boxes that you hunt for online. <br/>
X is for eXchanged.  Those are personal stamps that you exchange with <br/>
another letterboxer.<br/>
HH - some folks count their HH in with their F, others choose to <br/>
count the HH they find seperately.  I suppose its up to you.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I asked Sir Balthazar about this awhile ago and he gave a really good <br/>
answer.  (I hope you don't mind Sir B that I passed this along!) <br/>
<br/>
P is for boxes Planted <br/>
F is for boxes Found <br/>
X is for personal stamps eXchanged with other boxers <br/>
E is for Events <br/>
HH is for Hitchhikers <br/>
L is for Lizards (some of us count them just to annoy others) <br/>
A seems to be for Attempted but I do not use that <br/>
D I have used for stamps Designed (I do not carve all my stamps) <br/>
R may be used as Rescued or Rehabilitated like when you find a box <br/>
torn up and you put a new book in or bag it <br/>
<br/>
Some folks like to add their plants, finds, and exchanges and come up <br/>
with a PFX number. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps  <br/>
