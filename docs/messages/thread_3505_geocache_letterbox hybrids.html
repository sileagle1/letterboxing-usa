                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've placed several boxes that are letterbox/geocache hybrids and listed <br/>
them on geocaching.com. I think that because of them there might be more <br/>
people interested in letterboxing in this area now. (at least I hope so)<br/>
<br/>
But there is one thing to be aware of --&gt; <br/>
_many_geocachers_will_ignore_everything_you_put_in_the_clue_except_the_coordinates_. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some download the coordinates only and won't even get the rest of your <br/>
clues. In some cases that's fine, but in others it's led to geocachers <br/>
tromping all over an area leaving no stone unturned and complaining that <br/>
the "cache" isn't there when the clues clearly indicate the additional <br/>
information that's needed to find the box. So my suggestion is to make <br/>
hybrids only in locations that can handle a large amount of trampling by <br/>
people carelessly focused on their GPS screens and to add a note to the box <br/>
explaining what to do and what NOT to do, such as exchanging a happy meal <br/>
toy for your hand carved stamp. (It wouldn't hurt to make them a little <br/>
more obvious to avoid the zealous rock turning some newbies do.) I enjoy <br/>
geocaching but I also recognize that many of the people who just start out <br/>
in it can be extremely clueless about searching an area carefully and <br/>
paying attention to anything other than a lat/lon pair. Letterboxers come <br/>
to the site expecting to pay close attention to clues.<br/>
