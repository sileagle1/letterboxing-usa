                    <div class="plaintext-content">since so many people are adding their two cents to this <br/>
conversation, I thought I might do the same. I belong to quite a few <br/>
other yahoo groups and have a couple of ideas from them that might <br/>
help us here. The changes would mostly have to be made by a group <br/>
moderator, but i thought I'd throw them out to the general public. <br/>
<br/>
One group i belong to sends out a lengthy introduction to the group. <br/>
let me stress the word "lengthy." but it covered everything <br/>
including the talking about the files and links sections, and <br/>
certain topics that will always start flame wars, etc... I was a <br/>
little intimidated after reading the intro, but as a new person to <br/>
the group I was fully warned. I lurked on that group for a few weeks <br/>
before I posted just to get a feel for things. These days I post <br/>
freely and have never gotten my butt chewed out by anybody. but i <br/>
was fully informed from day one. <br/>
<br/>
Another group sends out an automated monthly message. it's mostly <br/>
for the new people who have joined in the last month and contains <br/>
some links that would be of interest to them. I know it's coming and <br/>
just move past it when it arrives in my inbox, but i'm glad it's <br/>
there. I'd rather hit delete once a month than read a dozen or more <br/>
emails asking the same questions. <br/>
<br/>
my last suggestion is a personal one. Because of the high traffic on <br/>
this list, I have opted to get it in digest form. I get one email a <br/>
day with all that days messages. My request is that we hit reply,  <br/>
we trim the previous posts as much as possible. most people are <br/>
already doing just that and I thank you. (I'll also admit that I <br/>
don't always remember to do it myself!) I'm not pointing a finger at <br/>
anyone here, but just thought if I was going to make suggestions <br/>
that I would add this gentle reminder while I was at it. <br/>
<br/>
and as a not so discreet way to try to change the subject....Who's <br/>
going 'boxing this weekend? <br/>
