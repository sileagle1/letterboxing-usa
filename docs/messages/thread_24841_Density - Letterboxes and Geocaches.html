having a high density of letterboxes. However, I came across an <br/>
interesting problem this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I am an adult leader in a Boy Scout Venturing unit that specializes <br/>
in Geocaching and Letterboxing.  On Sunday we took the crew out on a <br/>
blended hunt of boxes and caches. The last cache we were going for <br/>
was a puzzle. The last box we were going for was well hidden in a <br/>
stone wall. So was the cache. Neither was labeled and they were set <br/>
about 100 feet from one another. We thought the first was the Box <br/>
since it appeared to have a backless foam stamp.<br/>
<br/>
We had already figured out the first two parts of the cache and <br/>
figured it was also in the area...but maybe we were off a little in <br/>
calculations. Well the second was the BOX and the first was the cache.<br/>
<br/>
It caused quite a bit of confusion. The first Box we found, earlier <br/>
that afternoon ad only a stamp and not a log book.<br/>
<br/>
In the end we found both but it would hve been more fun to have the <br/>
challange intended.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This poses a problem as there are a lot of geocachers out there who <br/>
have no idea what a letterbox is and visa versa. I have found two <br/>
such caces in the last year. <br/>
<br/>
I am also begininng to see letterboxes and geocaches being hidden <br/>
very close to one another. As an example a new Lb poped up in my area <br/>
two days ago and it is locacted in a very, very small park near where <br/>
I live. There is already one Lb in that park and is about 6 months <br/>
old. They are 150 yards apart. I think that as people become more <br/>
interested in either hobby that they, in there excitement cannot wait <br/>
to plant a box and end up planting it in the first place they think <br/>
of that has a hidding spot...I was there so I shouldn't through <br/>
stones. But the end result is that some areas are becoming crowded.<br/>
