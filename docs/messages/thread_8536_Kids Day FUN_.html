<br/>
Thanks to all who were involved in organizing, planting and <br/>
planning "Kids day".  I brought my toddler and convinced my sister-in-<br/>
law, mother-in-law, niece, and nephew to give letterboxing a try.  I <br/>
think they're hooked!  The kids were disappointed that we didn't have <br/>
time to get all the boxes, but really had a great time filling their <br/>
books and meeting the other junior letterboxers.  They've been to <br/>
this park lots of times and were amazed that there could be so many <br/>
boxes hidden there.  What a wonderful day it's been!<br/>
