                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've had 2 of 12 planted boxes go missing within my first 3 months <br/>
of boxing.  I know I've learned how to better hide boxes, but I <br/>
think it's always, always a risk that a box will go missing no <br/>
matter how carefully you place it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm starting to really LOVE some of my stamps.  How many <br/>
images/impressions do you guys make of your stamps before you kiss <br/>
them goodbye into a box?  I've started making about a dozen <br/>
impressions so that I could cut them out and use them in some <br/>
projects later if I get the urge.  I've also started stamping one or <br/>
two gift cards and note cards with some of my favorites before <br/>
boxing them up.<br/>
<br/>
Is this kosher?  I know there's not a rule about it, but what say <br/>
you?  Does anyone else make extra copies besides just in a journal?  <br/>
Or do you just carve a second stamp from the same pattern and keep <br/>
one to use personally?<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  If anyone's found some of my lame first attempts, don't <br/>
laugh.  I really AM getting better and some are looking really great <br/>
on handmade note cards...<br/>

Zed,some of the very best and neatest locations always seem to have <br/>
the crappiest stamps. Those are always locations you want to plant <br/>
first and I guess it evens out when you finally get good at carving, <br/>
the locations aren't as great as the early spots. I look back at my <br/>
early stamps and shudder, but don't intend to do any replacements <br/>
unless they go missing.<br/>

Now, for nostalgia's sake, I leave that shabby cannon in place.  Heck, a lot of us old military pieces are a little shabbier for wear, but we're cute that way.<br/>
