                    <div class="plaintext-content">Be careful when buying the Speedball Speedy-Stamp pink carving <br/>
material.  There are two different types!<br/>
<br/>
Deciding this was my carving medium of choice, the other day I went <br/>
to my local Hobby Lobby and picked up three 4 x6 pieces and an 8 x 12 <br/>
piece.  I quickly used up the first 4 x 6 piece and opened the <br/>
second, only to find it is different material than the first!  It has <br/>
a tacky surface and the inner consistency is harder.  Even after <br/>
cleaning it up, my knife pulled and jerked -- didn't carve smoothly <br/>
at all (even with a brand new sharp knife blade).  The packaging is <br/>
identical, but upon closer inspection, the coloring is a little <br/>
different (the good stuff is slightly lighter in color), the product <br/>
numbers are different (good stuff - 4108, year 2001; bad stuff - <br/>
4110, year 2000) and the bad stuff doesn't have the UPC imprinted <br/>
right on the block.<br/>
<br/>
My large 8 x 12 piece is also the tacky stuff (product number 4109, <br/>
year 1999).  I am returning them to the store.  Hopefully they will <br/>
take them back and they have some more of the good stuff I can buy.<br/>
<br/>
Realizing all of my pink material was useless, I desperately hunted <br/>
around for something suitable to carve on, near withdrawal!  I then <br/>
realized I had just received the package of Steadler Mastercarve <br/>
blocks I had ordered (still unopened).  This stuff carves nicely, but <br/>
is a little soft and crumbly -- can break off where you don't want it <br/>
to.  But it will do for less intricate designs, and certainly until I <br/>
can get my hands on more of the good pink stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have a good online ordering source for the pink speedy-<br/>
stamp pieces?<br/>
<br/>
Happy carving!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Deb, have you tried PZ-Kut? It is WONDERFUL and inexpensive. I believe it is<br/>
a byproduct of some manufacturing process. It comes in only one size, about<br/>
5 x 10, and is thin (like the pink stuff). I've used it for two years and<br/>
have had no problems. It is available from only one source, April Pease,<br/>
online. Here is her Web site: http://www.investorsnet.com/stampeaz/ She also<br/>
sells what she calls "B" quality at a cost reduction, and frankly I have<br/>
never seen any difference between that and her "A" quality. I ran across<br/>
this stuff through the Carving Consortium (April is a member).<br/>
