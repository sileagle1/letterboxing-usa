I heard an interview with author of this book on the radio on the way<br/>
home today. This sounds really cool. I found the website:<br/>
<br/>
www.atreasurestrove.com<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone read the book yet?<br/>

what a neat idea, but it will be someone already rich, that can afford to <br/>
travel all over the usa, or hire someone to hunt for them LOL<br/>
<br/>
but a great way to sell some books<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE puzzles, i may get the books just for the puzzles<br/>

I believe this idea was first done by an author and artist named Kit<br/>
Williams. His gorgeous book "Masquerade" was beautifully illustrated<br/>
and contained hidden messages to a treasure that was, I believe a<br/>
beautiful hand make inlay box with a jewel inside. It was published in<br/>
1979 and the author claimed the clues were so easy a 10 yr old could<br/>
solve it. Unfortunately someone stumbled on the burried treasure<br/>
without solving the puzzle....sound familiar?<br/>
<br/>
Don't know if he knew about letterboxing, he's Brittish so he could<br/>
have heard about it in England...<br/>

Treasure: In Search of the Golden Horse, which was published in 1984. <br/>
(I have fond memories of my fourth grade teacher reading it to us in<br/>
hopes that we'd figure out the clues and find the treasure...) <br/>
There's more information about it here:<br/>
