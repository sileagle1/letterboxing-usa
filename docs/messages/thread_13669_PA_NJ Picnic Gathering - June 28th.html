                    <div class="plaintext-content">10 days to go! It looks like we'll have a good turnout if the weather <br/>
co-operates (for a change). Ed is cranking his 2 1/2 alarm chili <br/>
recipe.<br/>
Bev is having ACE stir her Brownie mix. Everyone bring along your <br/>
favorite goodies. Here are the details one last time:<br/>
<br/>
TIME: Around 11am on Saturday the 28th.<br/>
PLACE: Moravian Pottery &amp; Tile Works, Route 313 Swamp Road, <br/>
Doylestown, PA (look for LbNA sign).<br/>
<br/>
We'll be on County Park property; so there's rules folks:<br/>
No alcohol.<br/>
Anyone bringing a dog must use a leash.<br/>
No Boom Boxes or other stuff the rangers would frown on.<br/>
Also:<br/>
Bring bug spray. The skeeters are healthy around here!<br/>
We'll swap stamps; so don't forget your gear.<br/>
There are two regular boxes hidden in the woods, and - just for this<br/>
gathering only - a third box along one of the trails. Also a bunch of <br/>
other boxes within a few miles.<br/>
NOTE: There is no shelter available; so if the weather is nasty, it <br/>
will be postponed. Check this Yahoo message source either late <br/>
Friday or very early Saturday for a final GO or NO GO.<br/>
Anyone needing specific directions, drop me a note.<br/>
