                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many are not aware that there are actually two separate entities <br/>
serving the letterboxing community in the US.  The first is a website <br/>
created by the webmasters providing information on letterboxing and a <br/>
splendid database for listing public letterboxing clues.  Special <br/>
thanks to Wes for the latter.  Until just a year ago the webmasters <br/>
of letterboxing.org had a very tedious job of creating webpages for <br/>
each and every new box listed.  Thankfully those days are over.  The <br/>
letterboxing.org site does not currently, however, provide a forum <br/>
for online discussion.  Letterboxing.org contracts with a webserver <br/>
to provide a large bandwidth site free and open to the letterboxing <br/>
community.<br/>
<br/>
The letterbox-usa is a FREE yahoogroup site provided by yahoogroups.  <br/>
Those serving as moderators on the yahoogroup site are limited by <br/>
what the yahoogroup setup will allow them to change or modify.  They <br/>
can admit members, ban members, utilize any of the links on the left, <br/>
etc.  They cannot change the way that searches are done or organize <br/>
the archives, etc.  Some of the advantages of changing to a forum-<br/>
style discussion group by a different free provider were alluded to <br/>
in SpringChick's recent post (40933).  <br/>
<br/>
So... if you would like to see changes to the letterboxing.org site <br/>
please contact Wes or myself (see message 41032).<br/>
