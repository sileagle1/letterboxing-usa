                    <div class="plaintext-content">yippee! checked on our boxes today and all three are there and intact.<br/>
We have had several visitors, only the first of which contacted us, so<br/>
it is wonderful to see letterboxing thriving in B.C.<br/>
yippee!<br/>
had to change the clues on the last one (Super Star) in the series<br/>
though as there was some clearing done and the clues did not make sense.<br/>
<br/>
We took some friends out today and they want to start planting boxes.<br/>
I am also taking some homeschooling families out over the next few<br/>
weeks, so we should see moe activity here on the west coast of Canada.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also hoping to get out soon to check out Ryan and Amanda's boxes at<br/>
Lynn Canyon<br/>
