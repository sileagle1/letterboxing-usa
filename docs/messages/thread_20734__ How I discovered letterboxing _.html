Ackletterboxer called me and told me she read this artical in a <br/>
Nantucket mag. After going to the LBNA web site and talking with <br/>
her, I was starting to get it. After making a trip to nantucket in <br/>
August I went with her to find her first box. (great point light <br/>
house) and got hooked. came home and went and found every box close <br/>
to home. can you say obsessed? i've since carved 8 stampes, planted <br/>
5 boxes and have found 23. can't wait to go down cape today for a <br/>
great day of boxing. I have always took my kids for nature walks on <br/>
trails and whatnot. its soo cool to know we can still hike but now <br/>
we can find treasure along the way...and i've chatting with some <br/>
great people (boxers i've meet) too.<br/>
