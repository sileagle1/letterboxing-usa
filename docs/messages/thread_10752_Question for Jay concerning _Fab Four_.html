Last week I finished carving stamps for a series to be placed here in <br/>
MA, and then yesterday stumbled upon your clues for "Fab Four".<br/>
What images did you use for these stamps? Mine are from the "Let it <br/>
Be" album cover and while I can easily change the name of the series <br/>
(and the names of the stamps) I'm planning, I would not want to have <br/>
duplicate stamps. If you could let me know what your thoughts are on <br/>
this I would appreciate your advice.<br/>

Hey, Brian! I just freehanded these: they're not really collectible <br/>
Beatlemania. Besides, whats a little overlap between friends? Too <br/>
many people have forgotten that amazing band.<br/>

Thanks Jay, The series will be unpublished (Kind of a Bonus Series <br/>
tacked on to another)and I did want to use the stamps. I have been <br/>
doing a bit of carving the past few weeks and can't wait to get them <br/>
all planted (Is winter ever going to end ?)but fear snow cover will <br/>
limit our options (We have a ton of snow up here!!). Really looking <br/>
forward to the CT gettogether/workparty day. Again Thanks! for all <br/>
you have done for ourfavorite past time.<br/>

Those who are old enough to remember, remember.  Those who are too <br/>
young to know what they're missing should be locked in a room with <br/>
only a CD player, a set of headphones, and all three volumes of The <br/>
Beatles Anthology.  Throw in the BBC Sessions, too, while you're at <br/>
it.<br/>

Can't get enough of the Lads.  I find the 2nd set wonderful for <br/>

I agree.  Not knowing the Beatles is like not knowing Mozart.<br/>
