As long as I own the domain letterboxing.org, it will not likely resolve <br/>
to a site that charges fees to view content, or requires membership to view <br/>
my faq or clues.  The compromise for users of the site wishing to protect <br/>
their clues in some way is for them to put them on their own site, <br/>
provide whatever security they wish, and post a link to their clues or <br/>
site.  Or, perhaps one of the sites that competes with letterboxing.org <br/>
will add this feature.  (OTOH, I may not always own letterboxing.org, or,<br/>
it may not always live there).<br/>
<br/>
While some reasoned and intelligent commentary was presented in favor of <br/>
doing this, the co-founders felt very strongly about openness, and it would<br/>
be a disservice to the memory of those no longer with us to violate<br/>
that trust now.  That's not to say I can't change my mind on anything and<br/>
am bound by ghosts and tradition, but this will be a tough sell.  Susan <br/>
has also written elegantly on the subject, and I imagine as long as she <br/>
is involved, it will be a tough sell for her as well.  (The fact is that<br/>
I'm very respectful of ghosts and tradition, and lbna has traditionally<br/>
been open).  As for specific reasons, others have written them already,<br/>
and it just feels better this way.  (of course, webmasters are supposed<br/>
to "vote" on these things, so lobby your favorite one ...)<br/>
<br/>
To respond to a specific comment (to paraphrase) - "how is this different<br/>
from requiring membership to the yahoogroup?" -- the answer is that the <br/>
status quo is actually the same.  To wit -- membership is required in this <br/>
yahoogroup to _post_, but not _view_ messages.  This was added in an attempt <br/>
to control spam only (try it for yourself, log out of yahoo, and go to <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/messages).  The lbna site <br/>
presently uses the same model.  Other letterboxing-related resources, of <br/>
course, work differently, tho it is not difficult for the prospective <br/>
ne'er-do-well to penetrate their defenses.<br/>
<br/>
As for writing books, I wrote one.  You can make me rich by going to <br/>
Amazon and buying a copy (try it for yourself at<br/>
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0762727942/mapsurfercom-20), and<br/>
then I'll give Ryan a loan :-)  I did this because I thought it was cool.  <br/>
Had I turned down this commission, someone else would have done it, and <br/>
it seemed better that an insider rather than a professional writer do it.  <br/>
The world hasn't ended.  Those who feel it has have adapted or retired.<br/>
It will be interesting to see who gets the Wiley commission.<br/>
<br/>
As for the press, the same things were said 4 years ago, and many<br/>
bemoaned what would happen.  Some people "in the club" generally want <br/>
control of "whose in the club next" after they've got in (and as an <br/>
owner of a gmail account, I guess I can relate to this (and the brilliant <br/>
marketing :-)).  My guess is that had a conspiracy of silence been <br/>
successful, most of the posters I was reading would not be here.  I guess <br/>
that is irrelevant, tho, as such a conspiracy is untenable, IMO.  Its <br/>
better, IMO, to talk to the media and say what _you_ want rather than <br/>
trusting the next person they find to do the same.  (OTOH, one could<br/>
easily counter the last two paragraphs by quoting JC Melloncamp --<br/>
"callin' it your job ol' hosse sure don't make it right" -- but I think<br/>
it depends what the job is ...)<br/>
<br/>
(The truth is, regarding membership and the press -- for a closed system to<br/>
have worked, it would have had to start off that way.  It is too late now.<br/>
But, unlike Dartmoor, we faced a formidable geography problem, so it would <br/>
have never gotten off the ground on a national scale without the internet.  <br/>
(And a couple of times, well into the game, it looked moribund, and the <br/>
press _saved_ it).  Thus we have the baggage of openness.  And also, even <br/>
Dartmoor's more closed culture was compromised, that is how we are _all_ <br/>
here -- media and openness). <br/>
<br/>
As for commercialism, I'm pretty moderate in that regard.  Other well-<br/>
respected sites are commercial, and tho there have been some complaints,<br/>
the world hasn't ended, and people find these sites valuable.  As someone <br/>
involved in amateur sports, hustling for sponsorship is a way of life, tho <br/>
the issue is divisive there also.  It would be nice if everything in the<br/>
world were free, and people could do what they want (the proverbial <br/>
brotherhood of man), but at the end of the day, you get what you pay for, <br/>
and you can't count on altruism to pay the bills forever.  Even "public <br/>
television" has sponsors, and even the writers of commercial-free open <br/>
source software are paid in the currency of prestige, resume bullets, <br/>
and consulting commissions.  <br/>
<br/>
I will say that I abhor banner ads, but that some sort of funding for lbna <br/>
would be a good thing, IMHO, tho the issue will always remain divisive.  I<br/>
will also say that I understand and respect the anti-commercialism attitude,<br/>
but have a "wouldn't that be nice, moderate, response to that".  All that <br/>
said, the stark reality is that money is (and has been) coming into <br/>
this space; it is just a question of where it ends up and how it is spent --<br/>
other sites that embrace commercialism may get stronger, and allow their<br/>
operators to spend 40 hours a week or more making them even stronger, and<br/>
so on ...).  OTOH, perhaps at the end of the day, lbna will maintain its <br/>
present state of minimal commercialism and commercial sites will wither.<br/>
Or, perhaps other sites will grow strong like geocaching.com, and those<br/>
using lbna will remain happy with the status quo.  IMO, there is no right<br/>
or wrong with the above, except for a closed mind (which is why I say<br/>
"tough sell" rather than "no chance" at the end of the day on some things).<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure some will prolly dislike me for the above attitude (and some already<br/>
do), but at least I'm honest :-)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I haven't written here in a while, so I'm entitled to some verbosity.<br/>
I hope people take my comments as thoughtful and just my $0.02, rather <br/>
than flames they are not intended to be, and I encourage thoughtful commentary<br/>
on these, and other issues.<br/>

and consulting commissions.  <br/>
<br/>
I will say that I abhor banner ads, but that some sort of funding for lbna <br/>
would be a good thing, IMHO, tho the issue will always remain divisive.  I<br/>
will also say that I understand and respect the anti-commercialism attitude,<br/>
but have a "wouldn't that be nice, moderate, response to that".  All that <br/>
said, the stark reality is that money is (and has been) coming into <br/>
this space; it is just a question of where it ends up and how it is spent --<br/>
other sites that embrace commercialism may get stronger, and allow their<br/>
operators to spend 40 hours a week or more making them even stronger, and<br/>
so on ...).  OTOH, perhaps at the end of the day, lbna will maintain its <br/>
present state of minimal commercialism and commercial sites will wither.<br/>
Or, perhaps other sites will grow strong like geocaching.com, and those<br/>
using lbna will remain happy with the status quo.  IMO, there is no right<br/>
or wrong with the above, except for a closed mind (which is why I say<br/>
"tough sell" rather than "no chance" at the end of the day on some things).<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure some will prolly dislike me for the above attitude (and some already<br/>
do), but at least I'm honest :-)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I haven't written here in a while, so I'm entitled to some verbosity.<br/>
I hope people take my comments as thoughtful and just my $0.02, rather <br/>
than flames they are not intended to be, and I encourage thoughtful commentary<br/>
on these, and other issues.<br/>

Sorry about that....I don't know, maybe it's not; I only said that because of Randy Hall's response--which I do respect as he is the owner of the site. I appreciated hearing his well-written response.  I admit I'm kinda clueless about site owners and list owners, etc. I tend to forget there are real live people, property owners,  with real opinions and liabilities behind these things!  Very sorry, Randy and the rest!  As an artist, I should know better.  It sounded as if he is not open to the membership option at this time, so I guess I assumed it didn't make sense to vote about it.  But if others think there is still reason to do so for future reference, ok.  Is the poll still happening?  I also was not aware of the .org and .com difference.  Is it true that if we required passwords (but no money) to access clues on the LbNA site, it would need to become a .com entity rather than .org ?  I'm not clear on that.  I still have to respectfully disagree with those who say it would keep people out.  Unless it's people who have 5 minutes initially to spend surfing on the website rather than those with a half-hour who decide to sign up.  Having the majority of clues available only online keeps people out in the first place, since there are those without access or knowledge of the computer.  That doesn't seem to be bothering us.  I sure don't want to beat a dead horse, but I do like to point out inconsistencies and oft-missed details!  --lunaryakketyact<br/>

There is absolutely nothing preventing a person or organization from <br/>
buying one rather than the other.  Non-profits can buy .com (in fact, <br/>
many do because so many people write .com out of sheer habit) any <br/>
many for-profit companies buy .org (so someone can't swipe up a <br/>
domain name like microsoft.org--which Microsoft would probably not <br/>
like to see happening).<br/>

could.  *shrug*  I only use .com because that's what most people type <br/>
out of habit.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, raise your hands--how often, when you were new to letterboxing, <br/>
did you try typing 'letterboxing.com' and think, "What the heck?!"<br/>
<br/>
Please don't be fooled into thinking there's a distinction <br/>
between .com and .org.  There's not.  Anyone can buy either of them <br/>
as they so choose--there's nothing to enforce that a .org domain is <br/>
non-profit, and there's nothing to enforce that a .com is truely <br/>
commerical.<br/>
<br/>
(As a side note, that's NOT the case for .edu, .gov, and .us -- as <br/>
well as others, but those are the main ones that ARE enforced.)<br/>

charging money to join would change us from a .org to<br/>
