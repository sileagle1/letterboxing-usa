                    <div class="plaintext-content">   We announced several weeks ago that we would be having a mini-<br/>
gathering on June 7th 2003 at the American Cancer Society's Relay for <br/>
Life. This event will be held at Montville High School, on Old <br/>
Colchester Road in Montville, CT. The relay itself is a huge <br/>
fundraiser for cancer research and awareness.  We encourage everyone <br/>
to attend and walk a few laps to support those of us who will be <br/>
partaking in this 24-hour relay.  <br/>
  Our mini-gathering will be a little different than most gatherings <br/>
in that there will not be boxes to go find at the actual event. There <br/>
will, however, be the oppurtunity for exchanges!  Additionally, we <br/>
have a special event stamp for the Relay for Life...a stamp which <br/>
will only be available at Relay and may circulate to Relays in other <br/>
states if someone would like to hold a similar gathering! <br/>
  Also: Butterfly will be releasing clues to 5 (i think 5) newly <br/>
planted boxes at the Walden Nature Preserve in Salem. This location <br/>
is about a 10 minute drive and has 3 existing boxes (Walden Preserve <br/>
and Two Tag Alongs). So for a 3 mile hike that afternoon you can get <br/>
an easy 8 (or more - hint hint!) boxes at Walden. These clues will <br/>
not be posted on the LBNA page until after the event. Steve helped <br/>
plant some of these boxes and the hike is very fun! Quite a boxious <br/>
little area!<br/>
   So here's the nitty gritty!!!  We're going to say 12:00 noon on <br/>
Saturday June 7th for our mini gathering.  I know a few people are <br/>
planning on coming later, so just drop us an email so we know when to <br/>
expect you.  Don't need to bring anything other than the usuall stuff <br/>
you would bring to go boxing. We'll be identify-able becuase we'll be <br/>
there as part of a group that has 3 motor homes in the school lot, by <br/>
the fence area and close to the main entry to the track. Look for <br/>
Steve's Ford Expedition (champagne colored). Madras the chocolate lab <br/>
should be there and you can seal the deal by finding Butterfly's <br/>
trademark hat! <br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!<br/>
<br/>
Steve, Heidi, and Madras<br/>
