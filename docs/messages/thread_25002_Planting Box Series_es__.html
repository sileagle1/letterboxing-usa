I call it the Park &amp; Ride series, because all of the boxes are in commuter lots around the state.  My goal is to have at least one in each county (CT only has 8 counties)--right now I think I have them in 6 counties (one box is currently unaccounted for).  They're all automobile logos--well, one is a motorcycle logo--and the known ones are silver planter's pouches tucked into guardrails.  I'm up to #11--#1 was the only one in a box at a train station, and it was either removed or fell down where it's unreachable.  I hope to bring my digital camera soon to visit it's location (after the snow melts) to see if I can tell whether it's still there.  Anyway, one of my letterboxing goals for 2009 is to really get one in every county!  Oh--they're labelled by number and make, with a couple of exceptions, i.e.  Park &amp; Ride #2:  Honda. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not a very experienced planter--it's just over a year since I planted my first box--but I just planted my 40th :-) <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know y'all are just havin' fun, but this continued thread of using <br/>
blood as a substitute for a dry ink pad is just creeping me out. <br/>
<br/>
Can we end the discussion and start a new one? <br/>
<br/>
I have a question, asked already of another group, but for the sake <br/>
of a new topic, I'll post it here. <br/>
<br/>
I'm working on creating a series of letterboxes. Originally, I had <br/>
planned to list them all together as a group, but the text of the <br/>
background stories and clues is rather long -- six pages on Word. <br/>
Therefore, I'm thinking of listing them separately, with a unifying <br/>
title (all the same box name), plus a #1 or Box #1 (2,3, etc.) <br/>
affixed to the ends of the titles, in MY preferred order of searching. <br/>
<br/>
Two of the boxes are in the same neighborhood, so I might group them <br/>
together in the same listing. <br/>
<br/>
Looking for words of wisdom from you more experienced 'boxers, as I <br/>
have yet to plant my first box. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks! <br/>

<br/>
For many years now, LbNA has allowed those insignificant pests who go<br/>
looking for letterboxes to report information about their finds (or<br/>
lack thereof). For that matter, I think there might be another<br/>
letterboxing site out there with similar features, but I can't<br/>
remember its name.<br/>
<br/>
My experience is that results can sometimes be hard to decipher when<br/>
people find some of the boxes in a series, but have reason to believe<br/>
that others might be missing. On LbNA, I recommend listing them<br/>
separately, but giving them names that tie them together.<br/>

I have cretaed 2 series of LB<br/>
and did both differently<br/>
<br/>
SHOP TILL YOU DROP ON FORTUNE BLVD in Milford MA<br/>
is still going stong after 2 years<br/>
4 boxes..with stamps and ink pad in the first 3 boxes<br/>
then the 4th box has the logbook<br/>
all 4 clues in same posting<br/>
<br/>
Hungry Hang Glider Pilot series 1 2 and 3<br/>
this one was a timed event on CAPE COD MA <br/>
only 1 month long<br/>
3 towns involved<br/>
and i listed 3 clues in each posting<br/>
stamps and mini logbooks in 1&amp;2 of each set<br/>
then a real logbook in the 3rd traditional box<br/>
<br/>
then the 8 who got all 8 boxes...got a bonus stamp<br/>
<br/>
this was a lot of fun for me and the CAPE COD off-season finders<br/>
