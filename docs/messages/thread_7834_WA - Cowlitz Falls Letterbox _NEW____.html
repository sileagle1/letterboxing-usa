When I put 'cowlitz falls' in the search, I found a site that lists <br/>
many NW waterfalls, and a list of waterfalls that are no more, like <br/>
Cowlitz Falls.  A good source for waterfall information.<br/>
<br/>
A warning, the stamp is only 1.8 (uncertified) on the LBNASAI :-(<br/>

Cowlitz Falls is no more<br/>
<br/>
Historically known as the Cowlitz Falls run and enjoyed as one of the <br/>
best bigwater runs in the state, this section is now buried beneath <br/>
the waters of Scanwea Reservoir.  Construction of the Cowlitz Falls <br/>
project was completed in 1994 resulting in a 610 acre reservoir.  In <br/>
the first edition of his guidebook published in 1991, Bennett <br/>
described Cowlitz Falls as follows, "The Falls begins with an <br/>
exciting ride over big rollercoaster waves, then through smaller <br/>
waves before hurling baoters around a left bend and into more <br/>
powerful hydraulics...at higher flows, the big waves that dominate <br/>
Cowlitz Falls become minature versions of rapids like Granite on <br/>
Hell's Canyon of the Lower Snake. This drop was dynamited and a 140 <br/>
foot high dam now stands in its place<br/>
<br/>
Cowlitz Falls Parks<br/>
The PUD has constructed a campground and day-use park for the public <br/>
at locations along the project reservoir<br/>
<br/>
Day-Use Park <br/>
The park is situated along Lake Scanewa which was formed by the <br/>
Cowlitz Falls Dam. This is a nine acre park designed for "day use" at <br/>
a site where a unique wooden arch logging bridge previously spanned <br/>
the river. The Champion 200 Road that led you to the bridge now gives <br/>
access to the lake where it narrows and becomes confined within the <br/>
previous river banks.  Picnic tables are found at various locations. <br/>
A boat ramp with a dock is available, as well as a small swimming <br/>
area for children.  No overnight camping is allowed. The gate is open <br/>
from dawn to dusk. Use of the Park is free to the public.<br/>
<br/>
Leonard "Bud" Allen Campground<br/>
The Campground offers a quiet natural environment. A good place to <br/>
stay while visiting Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier, or to relax <br/>
and do a little fishing. The Campground covers 110 acres and provides <br/>
over 100 campsites, 40 with water and electric hookups. A picnic area <br/>
with tables and barbecue units is available.  There are nature trails <br/>
for your walking and biking enjoyment as well as a play set for the <br/>
kids. A boat launch gives boaters access to the lake. Rainbow trout <br/>
are planted regularly throughout the summer. <br/>
<br/>
To The Trailhead<br/>
<br/>
The easiest way to get there is to follow the signs.  As you drive <br/>
along US 12 you will see a  brown sign at milepost 111 that will lead <br/>
you to the site.  Turn south onto Savio Road.  Turn right on Kiona <br/>
Road at the brown sign.  Turn Right on Falls Road at the brown sign <br/>
to the Day Use Park; note the smaller blue signs.  Turn left on 280 <br/>
road at the blue signs.  Follow the curve to the left to get on 200 <br/>
Road, which takes you right to the Day Use Park.  Park in the lot, <br/>
out of the way of the boat launch.<br/>
