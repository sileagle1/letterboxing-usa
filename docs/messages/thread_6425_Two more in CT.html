<br/>
This week, we took it easy, and only made for two boxes, and scouted some <br/>
parks for possible placement in the future.<br/>
<br/>
The first stop was back at the Windsor River Trail in Windsor, CT. <br/>
Unfortunately, when we went there last week, we didn't realize that a third <br/>
box had been placed there as well by a different owner than the first two, so <br/>
we went back to rectify that oversight. Good thing, too, as it turns out we <br/>
were the first visitors since it's initial placement earlier this summer. The <br/>
box was a little damp from recent rain, but in perfect condition.<br/>
