                    <div class="plaintext-content">After pouring over this long thread, I have taken note of one VERY important point that I have <br/>
not seen mentioned. Most of Mount Desert Island is a National Park. As most of us know, the <br/>
Parks system does not look kindly upon letterboxes. In fact, it is considered grounds for legal <br/>
prosecution by the USNPS. <br/>
<br/>
What most probably don't know, is that there are efforts afoot by a venerable letterboxer to <br/>
change this policy in this very park. An ill-conceived "letterboxing" event could easily destroy <br/>
this ongoing effort. Please, please, please reconsider using the term letterbox in any way in <br/>
association with this fundraiser. Funhog<br/>
