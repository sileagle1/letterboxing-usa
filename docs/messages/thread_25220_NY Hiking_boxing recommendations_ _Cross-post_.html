<br/>
We'll be attending the Historic Hudson Valley event on Labor Day weekend and will actually be out in NY for 10+ days of hiking &amp; boxing. We're flying into Albany, so we're thinking of spending 5 nights in the Adirondacks and then 5 nights near the Catskills.<br/>
<br/>
We're researching clues &amp; boxes in the area and have a nice list going. However we'd love to get any specific recommendations that any of you might have. We particularly like longer hikes.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone also has recommendations for a good town to stay in and any favorite restaurants, we'd appreciate the info!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

If you are flying into Albany check out the Albany Rural cemetery. There are one or two boxes there and it is just a really cool place. It's as big as a city and alot of it is in disrepair. Chester Arthur is buried there. Spent an hour or two there with SSB and Pink and would have stayed longer but it was getting dark.<br/>

We are new to letterboxing,but have gotten hooked. How long will you be in Albany, there are a couple other good ones in addition to Albany Rural Cemetery, a short drive to Montogemery Co.(Melts in your mouth) and Mythological Monsters). Placer Turtle Run. Both on a Nordic Ski Trail and quite a hike. 9 boxes in all. Wonderful stamps. We have found several placed by them and  they are great.<br/>
Another good trail is  Chatham,NY a short drive from Albany.<br/>
Have not looked in the Adrondacks yet,but can give you a couple sites for lodging and hiking<br/>
www.garnet-hill.com  rustic lodge.  www.adk.org  trails,lodging and all kinds of info for the adorondicks. Do not know about boxes there. Hope this is of some help.<br/>
What is the  Historic Event you will be attending?<br/>
