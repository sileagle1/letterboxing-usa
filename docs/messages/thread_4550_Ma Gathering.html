                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Khatru for getting the MA letterboxers together. I had a wonderful<br/>
time and it was fun matching people to their stamps. I hope we will be able<br/>
to do it again. Alan's hand carved event stamp was unbelievable. I still<br/>
don't know how Wanda and Pete manage to get as many boxes as they do but<br/>
they are incredible. And The "leader of the pack"....well she looks just<br/>
like her stamp, and must have an amazing amount of energy. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to the next gathering.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">First I need to thank Khatru for organizing the Mass. Gathering.  My <br/>
brother and I had a wonderful time at Barber's Crossing.  It was <br/>
wonderful to meet so many fellow letterboxers.  Listening to people <br/>
swap stories about letterboxes they have found or placed was <br/>
wonderful.  It is so nice to put a face to the names and stamps I see <br/>
in letterboxes every weekend.  I can't wait to get together again.  I <br/>
immediately came home and began designing a few boxes that should go <br/>
out soon.<br/>

If anyone has developed pictures, please send them to me and I will <br/>
add them to the Mass. Gathering Web Site:  <br/>

A great BIG thanks for the Great Gather Event Stamp.  It sure was liked<br/>
by all. And just think, it was made by one of us Ct. people.!! You did<br/>
good!<br/>
It was such fun seeing letterboxers that I already know and then meeting<br/>
new ones to put together with their stamps. Carol  [Leader of the Pack],<br/>
Bonnie[Lobster Lady ] and I went on and picked up two nice fast ones so<br/>
we can say that we have some new Ma boxes. Thanks to you Ma. friends<br/>
also for such a nice meeting place.<br/>
