letterbox.  It is in Schmitz Park in Seattle.  Here is the info:<br/>
<br/>
	Schmitz Park,  Seattle, Washington<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From I-5 take the West Seattle Bridge to SW Admiral <br/>
Way.  Follow Admiral Way uphill, through the business district, and <br/>
downhill to SW Stevens (watch for the "rainbow" park sign on the <br/>
left, just before Admiral Way crosses a bridge over the ravine). Turn <br/>
left at the sign and keep right, following the road down to the <br/>
parking area.  Park in the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  easy<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  From the parking lot, start at the sign that says "Leash Pets <br/>
and Obey Scoop Laws".<br/>
Take the main path to the right past a rock commemorating the <br/>
bicentennial planting of fir trees.<br/>
You'll come to a fork in the path, take the right fork upwards.   <br/>
Further along the trail, there will be a small wooden bridge to your <br/>
left.  Take the bridge and at the second section of bridge, there <br/>
will be on your left a tree with fallen trees on either side of it.  <br/>
You can step off the bridge onto one of these fallen trees.  At the <br/>
base of the standing tree, within the roots is the letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
You can go back the way you came, or follow the trail back to the <br/>
parking lot.  There are many secondary trails that criss-cross this <br/>
park.  Also, many local schools use the park as an outdoor <br/>
classroom.  Please be discreet.  I hope to plant some more <br/>
letterboxes in this park soon!<br/>
<br/>
This is an Old-growth Evergreen Forest in the heart of Seattle.  <br/>
There are a variety of birds, trees, ferns and shrubs in the park.<br/>

<br/>
Can't wait to look for it.... must... finish... signature.... stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Plan A isnt working out so well for me... I had wanted to take my custom <br/>
design and have a stamp commercially made, but so far that looks to cost me <br/>
$20+ (for a 2x2 stamp), but I'm gonna check a couple more places.<br/>
<br/>
Ive read up a bit on stamp carving at Der Mad Stampers site, so I might <br/>
give that a whirl this weekend.  (crossing my fingers)<br/>
<br/>
I bought 3 log books last night....  Bellevue art is having a big sale - I <br/>
got some *nice* books for half off (Spiral bound, decoritive cover <g>).  I <br/>
still need to decide on ink, and get the box and other odds and ends.  I'll <br/>
prolly skip outta work early and hit the local craft store  =D<br/>
<br/>
So?  Was it fun to do?  Did you have trouble finding a hiding spot?  Did you <br/>
get any funny looks?  Gimme dirt (so to speak)  =D<br/>

&gt; Hey there, I finally got off of my duff today and planted my first <br/>
