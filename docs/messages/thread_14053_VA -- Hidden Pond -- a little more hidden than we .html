are letterboxing 'cause sometimes things aren't where you imagine them to <br/>
be!<br/>
<br/>
In an effort to beat the steady climb of the thermometer, team BeMa headed <br/>
out pretty early to the Hidden Pond Nature Center in search of the Happy <br/>
Homeschoolers three box series.  Either those Homeschoolers are pretty smart <br/>
or Da and I have been out of school a little too long because we did have a <br/>
teeny bit of trouble and confusion at the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Getting there is half the battle -- first we messed up a bit on the driving <br/>
directions.  We saw Greeley Boulevard and went for it (I'm mean really, how <br/>
many can there be?!...)  Well, there are two of them so when the Happy <br/>
Homeschoolers say go to the one past Rolling Road -- you gotta listen to <br/>
them.  I kinda figured we just missed Rolling Road. Da figured it was a kind <br/>
of short cut.  Anyway, we followed the first (wrong) Greeling Blvd and <br/>
followed it to the end (which happened to be after the second left after a <br/>
different part of Rolling Road so go figure!).  We came to a cul de sac with <br/>
a sign for Hidden Pond Park -- but, no nature center.  Oh well, we donned <br/>
the pack, lotion, bug spray, hats, checked for the clues, compass, water <br/>
bottles, trinkets Miss Ma wanted to load up in her pockets and headed off <br/>
down the paved path as per directions.  But, we came to several houses and <br/>
no nature center. Hmmmmm.  Thought about it for a moment, back tracked, took <br/>
off the hats, the pack, unloaded the trinkets, water bottles, clues etc. and <br/>
hopped back in the car to tool around a little bit.  Eventually we figured <br/>
out our mistake and found the nice parking lot for the nice nature center <br/>
(with a nice playground to boot!)<br/>
<br/>
Despite a flagrant dearth of knowledge concerning trees, we made our way to <br/>
the first Liriodendrom tulipifera and Da paced out the yardage into the <br/>
woods for the two for one tree.  There were several two for ones in that <br/>
area.  Now, if it had been a two for one sale, as in buy one box of Godiva <br/>
chocolates, get one free -- I would have been quite happy.  Trees, on the <br/>
other hand...  This is where the persistence paid off.  We just kept walking <br/>
around up to all the trees looking for logs until we found it safe and sound <br/>
-- yeah!  We stamped in and, after reading someone's cryptic warning to <br/>
"watch out for swamp snakes" (which I mistakenly read out loud to Miss <br/>
Ma...) we headed out for number two.<br/>
<br/>
Number two involved several more types of trees and lots of compass reading <br/>
but we found it with no problem.  We read that several people had difficulty <br/>
with box #1 (which also might be easier to see in the winter when the <br/>
prolific ferns aren't obscuring the fallen logs as much).  We were learning <br/>
a lot about trees and wildlife as we went along.  We saw a chipmunk and <br/>
several toads, not to mention humungous earth worms.  The birds at Hidden <br/>
Pond have got it made!  Thank goodness -- no swamp snakes although you can <br/>
bet I was looking for them!  I decided to let Miss Ma sing her medley of <br/>
Patriotic tunes suitable to Fourth of July letterboxing as loud as she <br/>
wanted.  If that didn't scare away the snakes, nothing would!<br/>
<br/>
Box number three was also a success!  The woods were nice and cool and it <br/>
was a very enjoyable way to spend our morning!  We saw these very <br/>
interesting plants all around box #3.  They appeared to be a cross between a <br/>
succulent, a fern, and something I would expect to see underwater.<br/>
<br/>
On the way back, the musical selection reflected our educational bent as we <br/>
explored geometry with different versions of the Sponge Bob Square Pants <br/>
theme song....  Sponge Bob triangular trousers....  Sponge Bob Octagonal <br/>
Overalls etc.  We may not know our trees -- but darn it if we're not quite <br/>
up on our shapes!<br/>
<br/>
On the way out we played at the very nice playground and watched all the <br/>
people who got out of their cars.  Unfortunately, not a clue sheet or <br/>
compass among them -- oh well!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Happy Homeschoolers!  BeMa<br/>
