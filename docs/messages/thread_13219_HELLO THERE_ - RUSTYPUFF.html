                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Kim, for the warm welcome.  I'm actually US born and bred but <br/>
my letterboxing partner is English so would that still qualify for a <br/>
crowd greeting???  I think both of us would love to go to New England <br/>
to hunt.  <br/>
<br/>
In fact, it's been discussed as Phillip is coming this way Aug/Sept.  <br/>
We were thinking that we'd like to head someplace lush with <br/>
letterboxes.  And it looks like that might be your backyard.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

&gt; Let us know where you will be visiting, so we can show you <br/>
&gt; around...especially if you are coming to the New England <br/>
area...you'll have a crowd show up to <br/>
&gt; meet you....(right Amanda from Seattle?).  Welcome to our happy <br/>
little hobby!<br/>
