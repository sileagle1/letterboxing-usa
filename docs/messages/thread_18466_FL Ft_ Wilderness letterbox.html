We've tried twice now, and everything matches the clues, and we seem to be <br/>
right on track, only we can't find the box!   It's a 3 1/2 hour drive from our <br/>
house, so it's pretty aggravating not to get it.   We've double checked our <br/>
compass readings, and thrashed around in the woods to no avail.   I've reached <br/>
the point where I'm ready to swallow my pride and beg for help!<br/>

Good to see this DebBee, 'cause I just got home from Disney last night and also<br/>
utterly failed to find this one even though the directions and clues completely <br/>
matched up with where I thought I was supposed to be.  Please email me at <br/>
werewulfmom at hotmail dot com if you hear from anyone and let me get in on <br/>
this dialogue as well.<br/>

On the lighter side, the nature trail was quite nice and it sure is pretty country <br/>
around there.  Saw some beautiful reddish birds (cardinals?) getting it on and lots of <br/>
assorted critters.<br/>
