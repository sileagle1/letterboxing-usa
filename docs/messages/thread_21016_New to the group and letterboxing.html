Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Just read about letterboxing today, and I am fascinated by it.  I do <br/>
a good deal of travelling, and hope to make letterboxing part of <br/>
that.  I live in the Philadelphia PA area.  I have already carved my <br/>
first stamp.  I am not very artistic, but I am happy with the stamp.  <br/>
Going to look for my  first letter box this week if the weather <br/>
cooperates.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for hosting the group!<br/>

One of my favorite things to do is find  boxes in different parts of the<br/>
country--each area has its own unique flavor.  I am notorious for extending<br/>
any travel I do in order to find a letterbox, lol.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you had success with your first hunt and  that you come to enjoy this<br/>
addiction--err--hobby as much as we all do.<br/>

Welcome and congrats on carving your own stamp! Just the fact that you<br/>
are doing that makes you more artistic then most! <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy and if you ever come up to Maine you will have lots of great<br/>
boxes to chose from up here!<br/>

Hi, Thanks for the welcomes to the group.  I went to find the 3 boxes <br/>
in the Pennypack Park series by Joseph today.  I found one of them.  <br/>
It was my first find (thanks Joseph).  I am looking forward to more <br/>
hunts and meeting some of you in the future.<br/>

At the bottom of the FAQS page you will find suppliers, or you can <br/>
go to www.stampeaz.com .<br/>
Another place to search would be on Atlas Quest at the Market Place.<br/>
