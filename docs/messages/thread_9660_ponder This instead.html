Well, In Ohio Between Franzsolo and MySelf we account a good hunk<br/>
of the Letterboxes about (2/3).  Beings so, It's hard to get letterbox finds <br/>
when you are the one placing them.  (Using a Term from Hang'em High) someone <br/>
has to be hanging from the Rope and someone has to do the Cutting.<br/>
<br/>
I have noted all of the nasty posting and people pushing the numbers BUT I <br/>
think the real true number to boost about are like this one..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                 P105 F140 X14<br/>
<br/>
I think that before you can boost about how many you find, You should<br/>
balance that P-F  If you found 500 GREAT!!! I'm really Happy for you But! if <br/>
you found 500 and placed 10, I think you are just riding on everyone and I <br/>
could care less about your 500 finds.  I think that<br/>
everyone who finds 100 should place 10, Which is not alot to ask!<br/>
<br/>
Also Gotta love the X number. I got lucky and got all of mine at our <br/>
Grathering (Which was great and look forward to summer 2003) BUT I have <br/>
never been  THAT lucky to run into anyone Letterboxing. (Which alot of <br/>
people have, Which is the real TRUE find)<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is fun, It's not about how many you can do in a day, It's about <br/>
finding different people. DIFFERENT PEOPLE DOC? WHAT DO YOU MEAN DIFFERENT <br/>
PEOPLE!!!, Well, Franzsolo and The FlyFisher were the first two hiders of <br/>
the Letterboxes I found and these two place a good hunk for my first 40 <br/>
finds, SO If it was not for them, I would not have placed so many as I want <br/>
to give back a few so THEY could have some boxes to find. In the process I <br/>
got to know these two guy's "By E-Mail" at first; Then at the Gathering. So <br/>
Get to know the People who place the Boxes and be known by placing a few <br/>
boxes yourself, because F should not be finds, F should be Friends.<br/>

&gt;I am not disagreeing with your sentiments but compared to what has<br/>
&gt;gone<br/>
&gt;before on this list, the numbers  discussion  hardly qualifies as an<br/>
&gt;argument.  Read the archives and one can find some real nastiness<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;went on before. The best policy may be just to ignore topics that you<br/>
&gt;are not interested in and derive your entertainment in your own<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;	I have planted two more boxes in central CA and have plans for<br/>
&gt;many more.  I have recently enjoyed finding funghog and lizardbutt<br/>

Oh, gosh, that just sounds like something else to argue about.  While <br/>
I'm all for people hiding letterboxes (after all--as you noted--how <br/>
can I find them if nobody else is placing them?), but some people <br/>
just aren't going to have an interest in hiding them.  And I don't <br/>
think there's anything wrong with that.  If it's not their cup of <br/>
tea, it's not their cup.  *shrug*<br/>
<br/>
Those people are certainly missing out by not hiding letterboxes, but <br/>
isn't that punishment enough?  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So Get to know the People who place the Boxes and be known by<br/>
&gt; placing a few boxes yourself, because F should not be finds, F<br/>
&gt; should be Friends.<br/>
<br/>
You know, that's kind of sweet.  =)  I kind of like the idea of <br/>
keeping track of all the new friends you've made from the hobby.  <br/>
I've certainly picked up many!  And, admittedly, the majority of them <br/>
are because I've started started swapping e-mails with people when <br/>
we've started finding each other's boxes.  Then meet in person at <br/>
gatherings.  Next thing you know, you're running through Guatemalan <br/>
jungles together to avoid mobs of machette wielding ex-military men <br/>
taking hostages and--get this--still joking about hidding letterboxes <br/>
along the way--while the US embassy is trying to fly out US citizens.<br/>
