Bludger 2 at Eagleville Preserve, I can't believe their luck! A <br/>
hitchhiker at the very first box they attempt. Well they are hooked <br/>
and are trying to decide where to take it this weekend. I don't know <br/>
if she found the list yet . I had given her printed materials at <br/>
school to get her interested.  Just thought you would like to know <br/>
where its been. Carol for a first timer in mansfield<br/>
