<p>Dearwebguys:</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your good work on this.</p>
<p>May I ask you to change the name of my box near Hannibal, NY 
to Hojack Trail #.</p>
<p>(It's currently named empress)</p>
<p>Here is Hojack Trail #2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Second on the Hojack trail </p>
<p>Difficulty-RR grade so it's easy walking but the trail has rough spots. </p>
<p>In the summer, poison Ivy is common. </p>
<p>Not recommended for small children. </p>
<p>Use common sense. </p>
<p>Please read the </p></dir>WAIVER OF 
RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLAIMER 
<p> </p>
<p>Continuing from Hojack Trail #1 cross Wiltsieville Road. </p>
<p>A gentle curve turns you a little more westerly to 280 d. As you walk along, 
hills rise slowly on either side of you, as you cut through the hillside, first 
head high, then towering overhead. You are walking through a canyon. You see 
another gentle curve, again toward the west. You follow the curve until you can 
see a change up a head. The path straightens abruptly and veers northward 
resumes 300 d. </p>
<p>The hills that had been towering over you disappear. Instead of walking 
through a valley you are now up on a causeway making a ramrod straight run 
across the valley.</p>
<p>The path rises gradually over the network of streams below. </p>
<p>It rises and narrows finally crossing thirty feet over the creek. </p>
<p>The box is here. </p><b>
