<div>Easy  1/2 hour or less not counting 
wonderful tour. </div>

EVERY PENNY</div>

<div>Visit the UVM Morgan Farm on Seymour St. in 
Weybridge , Vt. follow signs from  Rte 103 in Weybridge . Upon arriving 
cast your eye on the classic horse. Morgans are known for their disposition and 
versatility. Western, English, Carriage Driving, Trail. Today  on the 50 th 
anniversary of the farm we witnessed the best of the breed " strut their 
stuff"  including a 36 year old carriage horse driven by its 
octogenarian owner We toured the facsility reveling in the Morgans beauty and 
talent.  We appreciate the wonderful history of Morgans. Many early Morgans 
were mounts for the US Cavalry. At the Remount Barn ( rear of the farm ) is 
where these beautiful war horses were bred and born.  Enjoy seeing the foal 
crop here.</div>
<div>    To find the 50 th anniversary 
box proceed to the  sign of the Remount barn take the path along the left 
side keep the fence to your right. The woods are on the left.  Where the 
trail says" You take the high road and I'll take the low road" take 
just 2 more paces then look left to the hollow. Retrieve the box quietly and 
stamp up somewhere private then tuck it back in unseen! This is a busy tourist 
place please be discreet.  Make sure the box is well covered with the stone 
and wood so it won't be seen in winter.  Have fun - Be 
safe!</div></body></html>
