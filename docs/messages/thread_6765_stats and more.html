entire history of a team or players stats aren't we the diverse <br/>
bunch. So lets smile and have it our way whatever that is! Count <br/>
don't count just get out and letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
Now I saw a post regarding P count and events - At the 4-H fair last <br/>
year we counted the boxes an event as they were not permanent. As we <br/>
now have permission to  leave boxes forever I would make them a P. I <br/>
think that makes sense.  So comeand get them  an note we have an <br/>
event stamp too this year. the X count at the fair is always good. <br/>

Also want to Welcome " The Conductor" to our ranks hope his first <br/>
letterbox  was a happy find. <br/>
