  See Joy and Floating Feather picked this up 6-21-01 at "A Quaker Yarn" in <br/>
  the Wissahickon Park in Philadelpha, PA., must have forgotten to date the <br/>
  logbook....opps!!!....it stopped by "Body Parts" in the same park and then <br/>
  visited the Valley Forge #2 letterbox on the same date.<br/>
  Placed in the "Merrill Creek" location 7-1-01.<br/>
  I believe Todd And Pam carried it on from there.<br/>

 The LbNA hitch hiker just got a ride on a big jet. It has been lounging <br/>
 in the coolest hiding place ever in Davis, CA for the last three months <br/>
 until I gave it a lift. Poor thing, it had to leave sunny California <br/>
 for the rainy climes of the Pacific Northwest. Who was that last <br/>
 letterboxer who dropped it off? There was no note on the page... red <br/>
 howling coyote, who are you? Funhog<br/>

 HI there, The hitch hiking stamps stayed with me for about ten days. I <br/>
 picked them up Dec. 11 in the UC Davis (CA) letterbox, the box with the <br/>
 world's gutsiest hiding place. Then I brought it home with me to OR and <br/>
 left them in one of our local boxes on the 21st. I tried to figure out <br/>
 its path and finders but it wasn't labelled well. (No dates or <br/>
 locations entered) But I think it went from its original home, the <br/>
 Pilgrim (probably in PA) to Finger Bridge(?), to Merrill Creek (a <br/>
 recent posting tipped me off that this is in NJ) to the Davis box. As <br/>
 far as I know it hasn't left the spot I placed it yet. I do think it's <br/>
 very cool that it has gone coast to coast! Funhog<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 The SWIAALB-LBNA hitch hiker was found by the Catbird and myself in the <br/>
Spirit of Dartmoor letterbox on 12/27. What a great box, Mad Stamper! We <br/>
really enjoyed both the clues and the location -- it was a pleasant way to <br/>
top off a full day of Portland boxing.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, LBNA kept us company for a while, telling us all about his trip across <br/>
the country, but he still had itchy feet. He mumbled something about helping <br/>
out the park service (?) and disappeared.<br/>
