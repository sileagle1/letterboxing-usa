Jonathan Trumbull Library Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Start in the center of town, at the junction of Routes 87 and 207. Pull into the Jonathan Trumbull Library and park here. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Jonathan Trumbull Library was founded in 1896 at a town meeting at which $100.00 was voted to begin a library. Over the years the library has been housed in four different buildings including the War Office, where Gov. Jonathan Trumbull held war councils during the Revolutionary War.<br/>
