                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Welcome to Letterboxing! Thank you for planting some boxes in the <br/>
Bay Area. If you try to hunt down some of the boxes in the Bay Area, <br/>
Palo Alto area for example, do some research first by reading the <br/>
archives. Some boxes are missing, and some are orphans. Sad to say <br/>
that some of the planters of the boxes have vanished from <br/>
letterboxing world, but we are blessed with just the clues that they <br/>
wrote. I would have never known about this one park if it wasn't for <br/>
the clues-well maybe never!<br/>

First, I need to look for the boxes that Funhog planted in So. San <br/>
Jose.<br/>
 Kids activities come first in my household, which means that for the <br/>
next two weekends Mom is taxicab driver. At least one event is <br/>
something interesting for me.<br/>
