                    <div class="plaintext-content">1) - The stamp was an unadorned chunk of eraser and was SO not worth<br/>
reaching out of the car window for. The book was a roll of toilet<br/>
paper. The box was a 12" x 12" purex casserole dish with lid. This<br/>
should be thrown into a pool of molten lava after you stamp it. (Hey,<br/>
it's still an F.)<br/>
<br/>
2) - The box was 'hidden' on the side of a trail 20 feet from the<br/>
same parking lot you just began hiking from 4 miles ago in the other<br/>
direction. The 'stamp' is a square of children's bathtub play foam<br/>
crudely cut into a . . . star? - and it doesn't hold ink well. Stamp<br/>
in, create faux animal teeth marks and scatter the contents among the<br/>
bushes.<br/>
<br/>
3) - The stamp was carved with a grapefruit spoon, all the letters<br/>
(we think they're letters) are backwards and the clues to the box<br/>
(that looked like discarded litter) rhymed....poorly. After stamping<br/>
in - return the box to the owner with a lovely engraved card,<br/>
requesting they try again.<br/>
<br/>
4) - The stamp was SO not worth enduring the rhyming clues then<br/>
hiking 10 feet beyond the corner of the parking lot to pick up. After<br/>
stamping in, let your children re-hide it.<br/>
<br/>
5) - The placer created clues SO obscure no one could find it. You<br/>
happened across it while hunting for truffles. The stamp is fine,<br/>
the box is fine, the book is homemade. Stamp in and leave it where<br/>
it was. Post a spoiler on the main Web list.<br/>
<br/>
6) - Good stamp. Good box. Good book. Stamp, rehide and go.<br/>
<br/>
7) - Great stamp - obviously took some time and effort. The clues<br/>
required some research and the hike was slightly challenging. The<br/>
book is store-bought, but recovered and personalized. Stamp, rehide<br/>
and post a note to the list about it.<br/>
<br/>
8) - The stamp is beautifully done. The book is pretty good too. In<br/>
fact this box could possibly be construed as better than your own.<br/>
But it was placed by a mouthy, obnoxious list member. Stamp<br/>
in, 'accidentally' mar the surface, then hide the box, slightly<br/>
opened, 30 steps from it's original spot. Tell no one about it.<br/>
<br/>
9) - What a great stamp! Very witty play on words for the<br/>
challenging and thought-provoking clues. Good spot too - short hike,<br/>
great view, vending machine nearby that has beer in it. The book is<br/>
artfully done and contains free beer coupons. Stamp in, write<br/>
congratulatory note to placer. Take all the coupons, carefully<br/>
rehide. Tell only your closest friends about it.<br/>
<br/>
10) - The stamp is tremendously wonderful and brings tears of joy to<br/>
the eyes of the beholder. The witty clues with high literary<br/>
references required a team of friends to decypher. Fantastic and<br/>
daring hiding spot with a majestic view, and the book is Gorgeous!<br/>
Handmade paper, bound in tooled Corinthian leather. The box is hand<br/>
carved jade and angels sing when you open it. Sunlight cascades<br/>
through a parting of the clouds as you realize you could NEVER do this<br/>
well by<br/>
yourself or with a warehouse of child laborers. After stamping in,<br/>
if the angels don't descend from the heavens to retrieve it, you<br/>
should throw the box into a pool of molten lava so that no one else<br/>
can ever have your precioussssss.<br/>

Many, many things I miss about Japan. Vending machines dispensing cans <br/>

you happen to spoil your own on the train ride to the office....... <br/>
and, yes, beer. Sometimes it's the little things you remember. :-)   [I <br/>
do try to forget the $3.00+ per LITER gasoline. Gotta love the trains.]<br/>

same parking lot you just began hiking from 4 miles ago in the other<br/>
direction. The 'stamp' is a square of children's bathtub play foam<br/>
crudely cut into a . . . star? - and it doesn't hold ink well. Stamp<br/>
in, create faux animal teeth marks and scatter the contents among the<br/>
bushes.<br/>
<br/>
3) - The stamp was carved with a grapefruit spoon, all the letters<br/>
(we think they're letters) are backwards and the clues to the box<br/>
(that looked like discarded litter) rhymed....poorly. After stamping<br/>
in - return the box to the owner with a lovely engraved card,<br/>
requesting they try again.<br/>
<br/>
4) - The stamp was SO not worth enduring the rhyming clues then<br/>
hiking 10 feet beyond the corner of the parking lot to pick up. After<br/>
stamping in, let your children re-hide it.<br/>
<br/>
5) - The placer created clues SO obscure no one could find it. You<br/>
happened across it while hunting for truffles. The stamp is fine,<br/>
the box is fine, the book is homemade. Stamp in and leave it where<br/>
it was. Post a spoiler on the main Web list.<br/>
<br/>
6) - Good stamp. Good box. Good book. Stamp, rehide and go.<br/>
<br/>
7) - Great stamp - obviously took some time and effort. The clues<br/>
required some research and the hike was slightly challenging. The<br/>
book is store-bought, but recovered and personalized. Stamp, rehide<br/>
and post a note to the list about it.<br/>
<br/>
8) - The stamp is beautifully done. The book is pretty good too. In<br/>
fact this box could possibly be construed as better than your own.<br/>
But it was placed by a mouthy, obnoxious list member. Stamp<br/>
in, 'accidentally' mar the surface, then hide the box, slightly<br/>
opened, 30 steps from it's original spot. Tell no one about it.<br/>
<br/>
9) - What a great stamp! Very witty play on words for the<br/>
challenging and thought-provoking clues. Good spot too - short hike,<br/>
great view, vending machine nearby that has beer in it. The book is<br/>
artfully done and contains free beer coupons. Stamp in, write<br/>
congratulatory note to placer. Take all the coupons, carefully<br/>
rehide. Tell only your closest friends about it.<br/>
<br/>
10) - The stamp is tremendously wonderful and brings tears of joy to<br/>
the eyes of the beholder. The witty clues with high literary<br/>
references required a team of friends to decypher. Fantastic and<br/>
daring hiding spot with a majestic view, and the book is Gorgeous!<br/>
Handmade paper, bound in tooled Corinthian leather. The box is hand<br/>
carved jade and angels sing when you open it. Sunlight cascades<br/>
through a parting of the clouds as you realize you could NEVER do this<br/>
well by<br/>
yourself or with a warehouse of child laborers. After stamping in,<br/>
if the angels don't descend from the heavens to retrieve it, you<br/>
should throw the box into a pool of molten lava so that no one else<br/>
can ever have your precioussssss.<br/>

&gt; &gt; 4) - The stamp was SO not worth enduring the rhyming clues then<br/>
&gt; &gt; hiking 10 feet beyond the corner of the parking lot to pick up. <br/>
&gt; After<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamping in, let your children re-hide it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 5) - The placer created clues SO obscure no one could find it. You<br/>
&gt; &gt; happened across it while hunting for truffles. The stamp is fine,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the box is fine, the book is homemade. Stamp in and leave it where<br/>
&gt; &gt; it was. Post a spoiler on the main Web list.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 6) - Good stamp. Good box. Good book. Stamp, rehide and go.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 7) - Great stamp - obviously took some time and effort. The clues<br/>
&gt; &gt; required some research and the hike was slightly challenging. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; book is store-bought, but recovered and personalized. Stamp, <br/>
rehide<br/>
&gt; &gt; and post a note to the list about it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 8) - The stamp is beautifully done. The book is pretty good too. <br/>
In<br/>
&gt; &gt; fact this box could possibly be construed as better than your own.<br/>
&gt; &gt; But it was placed by a mouthy, obnoxious list member. Stamp<br/>
&gt; &gt; in, 'accidentally' mar the surface, then hide the box, slightly<br/>
&gt; &gt; opened, 30 steps from it's original spot. Tell no one about it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 9) - What a great stamp! Very witty play on words for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; challenging and thought-provoking clues. Good spot too - short <br/>
hike,<br/>
&gt; &gt; great view, vending machine nearby that has beer in it. The book <br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt; artfully done and contains free beer coupons. Stamp in, write<br/>
&gt; &gt; congratulatory note to placer. Take all the coupons, carefully<br/>
&gt; &gt; rehide. Tell only your closest friends about it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 10) - The stamp is tremendously wonderful and brings tears of joy <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the eyes of the beholder. The witty clues with high literary<br/>
&gt; &gt; references required a team of friends to decypher. Fantastic and<br/>
&gt; &gt; daring hiding spot with a majestic view, and the book is Gorgeous!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Handmade paper, bound in tooled Corinthian leather. The box is <br/>
hand<br/>
&gt; &gt; carved jade and angels sing when you open it. Sunlight cascades<br/>
&gt; &gt; through a parting of the clouds as you realize you could NEVER do <br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; well by<br/>
&gt; &gt; yourself or with a warehouse of child laborers. After stamping in,<br/>
&gt; &gt; if the angels don't descend from the heavens to retrieve it, you<br/>
&gt; &gt; should throw the box into a pool of molten lava so that no one <br/>
else<br/>
&gt; &gt; can ever have your precioussssss.<br/>
