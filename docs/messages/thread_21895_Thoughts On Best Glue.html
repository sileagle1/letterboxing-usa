<br/>
Almost any glue that will hold really well will also have risky fumes.<br/>
 If you want a glue that's going to hold, my best advice is to work<br/>
outside so the odor isn't such an issue.  (And yes, forget superglue<br/>
with kids... it's just too risky.)<br/>
<br/>
You'll find several good options at the crafts supply store, but--no<br/>
matter what the label says--most of them are going to smell.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to use the adhesive intended for sticking linoleum to floors,<br/>
which holds up very well, but--phheeeuuuuw!--it stinks!<br/>

leave the object soaking in water for hours!<br/>
I used to direct a kids-day-out/preschool program and we used it for exactly<br/>
the kind of project you're describing. (It does wash off easily from kids'<br/>
hands, and can be cleaned from clothing although it's easier if you dilute<br/>
it immediately!)<br/>
One hint: keep the glue propped upside down with the cap on between uses, or<br/>
the kids will be a little frustrated in how slowly the glue drips out. I<br/>
used to use the smallest size jelly/canning jars, which won't tip over and<br/>
despite being glass are virtually unbreakable.<br/>

 But I have to agree that the smelly ones work better, as they're <br/>
not water-soluble and don't just soak way down into the foam. So if <br/>
you can't use smelly, use thick and gooey.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's a couple of ideas, I've not seen mentioned yet:<br/>
<br/>
1) There is a product called Craft Foam Glue made by the Beacon<br/>
company. It's very sticky so be careful not to glue your fingers<br/>
together. I've seen it in stores like Michaels and Walmart.<br/>
<br/>
2) Xyron - run the foam through and let the kids peel their own from<br/>
the paper backing. This is considered a "dry" adhesive (such as the<br/>
spray adhesives mentioned by some others) It is also very sticky if<br/>
you get it on the fingers, but it doesn't smell bad and can be used<br/>
indoors.<br/>
<br/>
3) Acrylic Gel Medium - you could probably mount a truck to a building<br/>
with this stuff ... LOL! Washes up with water, has a long "open time"<br/>
for making sure you have gotten the position just right and doesn't<br/>
smell bad so you can use it indoors. It's easier to direct you the<br/>
stamp mounting tutorial album than to try to explain it any more. I've<br/>
had stamps mounted to fun foam with Gel Medium for over a year and<br/>
they're still out there doing fine. here's the link:<br/>
ww.picturetrail.com/bindle_boxers <br/>
<br/>
Thanks what I can think of off the top of my head. Hope that helps and<br/>
that you have lots of fun with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy! <br/>
