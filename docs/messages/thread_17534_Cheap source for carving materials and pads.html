                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those fortunate enough to live where there are "Dollar Tree" <br/>
stores, I've already mentioned them as a source of great, cheap <br/>
carving erasers.  (The "Be Sharp" brand, with 5 to a pack for $1 - 1 <br/>
large and 4 small.)  Really unbelievably carve-able for such a cheap <br/>
price!!!<br/>
<br/>
They also have, from time to time, some collections of (rather ugly) <br/>
rubber stamps for kids, that are a great source for tiny stamp <br/>
pads!  These pads come 2 to a pack with several commercial kiddie <br/>
stamps included.  The stamps are 1 inch by 1 1/4 inch and have a <br/>
raised pad and are encased in plastic with a clear plastic cover.  <br/>
Perfect for small boxes!  I buy these by the handful and give the <br/>
stamps to kids.  I buy a larger pad for them to use and keep the <br/>
mini's for me.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, they also have a kit of tiny valentine stamps with a pad <br/>
that is 1 3/4 inch square in a hinged plastic case.  Unfortunately, <br/>
the pad is not raised - but you could remove the pad - the pad <br/>
itself is about 1 inch square.  I'm even going to experiment with <br/>
raising it, using some foam material, and putting it back in the <br/>
case - I think that might work.  This kit is also just $1 for the <br/>
whole thing - give the 6 mini stamps to the kiddies.<br/>
<br/>
They also have, in the toy department, a set of 3 tiny pads with a <br/>
decorative, brightly-colored foam cover and closed with a snap.  <br/>
Included are 3 short ink pens, also covered in foam.  Both the pads <br/>
and the pens have "key chain" fobs which are easily removed.  Again, <br/>
these are great for small boxes.<br/>
<br/>
To Steve and Silver Eagle and Cami and the rest of the Louisiana-<br/>
Texas-Mississippi crew, I'm real close to planting 4 more boxes - 3 <br/>
in Baton Rouge and one in Jackson, MS.  If I don't get side-tracked, <br/>
at least 3 of them should go in this week - they are sitting here <br/>
ready to go.  I'll post when they are out there.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Szorzi, for the great tip!!!  I've been searching all over for a big <br/>
eraser to do my next carving.  I didn't even know there was a Dollar Tree near <br/>
me (N.J.) until I looked in the phone book. I got exactly what I needed.  <br/>
Can't wait to start on my new stamp!<br/>
