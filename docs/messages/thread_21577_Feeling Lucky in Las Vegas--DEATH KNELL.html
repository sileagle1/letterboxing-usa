I can confirm that BOTH Feeling Lucky Letterboxes at the Siegfried &amp; <br/>
Roy Plaza on the Las Vegas Strip are missing--poof!--gone!  It's <br/>
magic!<br/>
<br/>
Actually, it looks like the shrubs around the statue got their annual <br/>
pruning and the grounds their annual raking and I can only imagine <br/>
that the gardeners assumed the orange and brown M&amp;M containers were <br/>
garbage and plucked them off to the local landfill.<br/>
<br/>
I am not going to replace this box, but I will offer a challenge:<br/>
<br/>
Wynn Las Vegas, Steve Wynn's newest resort, opens to the public in <br/>
April and guess what?  The man built a forested mountain and lake in <br/>
front of it.  I would imagine there are trails,so I challenge anyone <br/>
to beat me to planting the first box there!<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck, boxers<br/>

I will be arriving in Vegas on March 27 and driving to Death Valley area for 1 night...then<br/>
back to vegas for Mar 28 pm-Apr 1.  I will have 2 teenagers with me...one lb's but the other one will have to be dragged to go.  I was thinking of trying that White Rock Canyon hike (one of Ryans boxes).  That sounded nice/if I can talk my kids into it.<br/>

I'll be around for an exchange...if you're going to Death Valley, be sure to stop in Rhyolite <br/>
and snag the two boxes there.  You'll also be able to see my museum/art park while there.  <br/>
The website for it is www.goldwellmuseum.org.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I will be arriving in Vegas on March 27 and driving to Death Valley area for 1 night...then<br/>
&gt; back to vegas for Mar 28 pm-Apr 1.  I will have 2 teenagers with me...one lb's but the <br/>
other one will have to be dragged to go.  I was thinking of trying that White Rock Canyon <br/>
hike (one of Ryans boxes).  That sounded nice/if I can talk my kids into it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone up for an exchange?<br/>
