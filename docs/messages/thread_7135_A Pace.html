I have seen conflicting information -- a short step, a long step, one <br/>
foot-fall, two foot-falls...  When the number of paces is small, the <br/>
discrepancy caused by this inconsistency isn't great and you can <br/>
still find your way, but as the number of required paces increases, <br/>
so too does the margin for error.<br/>
<br/>
So far the clues for boxes I have hunted have been such that once I <br/>
have taken the indicated number of paces, there is mention of an <br/>
identifying landmark and I can then adjust my position in the event <br/>
my pace was slightly off intention.  But in the event that such a <br/>
check-sum is not provided, I would like to be more confident that my <br/>
paces have carried me the anticipated distance.<br/>
<br/>
(Forgive me is this has been previously discussed, but it would have <br/>
been prior to my interest).<br/>

&gt; How much is a pace?<br/>
<br/>
I think the answer to this is in the faq and I think the answer was<br/>
that it is the same as a step.  This was decided by a poll of the group<br/>
a long time ago.  Not that that matters because some people don't read<br/>
the faq and everyone's pace/step is different anyway (e.g. kids, tho <br/>
knowing a kid wrote the clues is useful information ... with a good clue<br/>
you should use and need every piece of information presented (except for<br/>
clues that use obsfucation and cruft, but this stuff is sometimes useful<br/>
elsewhere ...)).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, good clue writers (IMHO) will give you ways to find the box without <br/>
luck and requiring inside information (e.g., how long their stride is or <br/>
whether or not they walked or took full strides, which affects pacing <br/>
distance significantly).  One way (as you mentioned), was the pace <br/>
calibration leg and/or confirming landmarks.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't have that, then generally you only have one or two legs<br/>
with pacing anyway (I mean, what sort of schmuck would have a clue with 30 <br/>
pacing legs and no calibration or landmarks -- if you ever run into such a <br/>
monster, my advice would be to look for "invisible landmarks" or some sort <br/>
of gimmick), and you can try both steps and double steps and something<br/>
else and usually find it.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully it is "well hidden".  So I can say MHO on that thread while I'm<br/>
here.  Part of the fun is looking around for a hiding place.  Its like<br/>
the universe has placed a letterbox for you to find, and finding such a <br/>
cool hiding place, that requires you to not disturb nature, and the hunters<br/>
not destroy stone walls and turn up every rock in the county is a real<br/>
treat.  A "well hidden" box will be obvious to the hunter once they have<br/>
solved the clue.  They should see the obvious hiding place when in the<br/>
vicinity, so its not a matter of luck nor a matter of turning over every<br/>
rock.  I mean, some of us do letterboxing as trail running (training), <br/>
and don't have time to destroy the park ...  and this can be fun for both<br/>
the hider and the hunter, that "ah" experience upon seeing the natural<br/>
hole in a log that is obviously where the box is.  (Of course, not always<br/>
possible, but look for these places as both a hider and a hunter).<br/>
<br/>
Now, has this ever happened to you:  You go to find a good place to put<br/>
a box, and whoops, there is already one there.  What is the proper <br/>
etiquette?  Is co-habitation legal in such circumstances?<br/>

Thanks Randy, I had seen the "official" definition in the FAQ, but <br/>
also conflicting definitions and was just curious...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes, this is a great feeling -- when you see the fallen log over <br/>
there and just "know" that is it, and you get there and peek inside <br/>
and ta-da...  there is the box!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Now, has this ever happened to you:  You go to find a good place to <br/>
put<br/>
&gt; a box, and whoops, there is already one there.  What is the proper <br/>
&gt; etiquette?  Is co-habitation legal in such circumstances?<br/>
<br/>
Not to me personally -- not enough boxes around Michigan for that to <br/>
happen yet, but I could see where it might in more letterbox-<br/>
populated areas.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm, that could be interesting and a pleasant surprise to find!  <br/>
Could also make for some great clue-writing possibilities (provided <br/>
of course, the person who placed the original box was okay with the <br/>
new living arrangements).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The FAQs say that the majority of letterboxers use a pace as equal to <br/>
a step.  I personally find this tedious for longer distances down a <br/>
trail.  Hence, nearly all my boxes in Ohio have the following sort of <br/>
statement.  It should make it clear to all who search for them.<br/>
<br/>
Next, take 29 paces down the trail to the East (one pace = 2 steps or <br/>
about 5 feet).  <br/>
<br/>
I have found that on most trails and roads and parks that there are <br/>
just about 1000 paces (my definition) in a mile, or 250 in a quarter <br/>
mile.  It even helps me in knowing how much further I have to go on a <br/>
canoe portage, which are for some reason always marked in rods.  (1 <br/>
rod = 16 feet or so = 3 paces = 6 steps) <br/>

Go figure!<br/>

Yes! And it's a wonderful confluence of parallel vibe. 'Cept they're <br/>
both *really* mysterious letterboxes so I can't say exactly where, <br/>
but her spot is 15 feet away and "better" (see Randy's xlnt def <br/>

<br/>
The term "pace" comes to us from the Romans. Their soldiers trained and <br/>
marched in paces, and their pace was a double step about five feet in <br/>
length. A Roman mile was 1,000 paces, or, in Latin, "mille passuum" -- <br/>
which is the origin of our word "mile."<br/>
<br/>
I definitely agree that a pace, whether a single step or a double step, <br/>
should never be used in a clue as a precise measure, but only to get the <br/>
finder in the right general location or point them to a unique landmark. <br/>
And regardless of whether a whether a pace is one or two steps, the <br/>
distance covered by one pace can vary greatly from person to person, <br/>
depending on your age, size and agility. The terrain can also affect the <br/>
distance of a pace, if the area is hilly or rocky or uneven.<br/>
<br/>
Even if there is a consensus about what 'boxers think a pace *should* be, <br/>
there are two existing definitions, and it's a clue writer's decision <br/>
whether to use the term "pace" or not, and whether to define a pace as one <br/>
step or two.  But it's the responsible thing for clue writers to let <br/>
readers know their definitions of a pace if they use the word.<br/>
