                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>Despite the heat and humidity in New England, today was a great day for letterboxing. Of course, just about any day is a great day for this, but that's not really the point, is it? &lt;g&gt;
<br/>
<br/>First stop, our first mystery box, the Rusty Acorn. After much searching and gnashing of teeth, we found the right place to go for the trail. For the longest time on the trail, we thought we were wrong, as it seemed impossible that we would find the landmarks the clue said would be there. Our faith in the clues was rewarded with the box. The Rusty Acorn is in great shape, and waiting for the next visitor.
<br/>
<br/>Off to the Northampton Bike Path, for a box that could almost be considered a drive by, unless you go the long way. The box is well hidden and intact. Our next target was another Bike It or Hike It box, the Norwottock Rail Trail in Amherst, MA. This box is also a very quick walk if you're familiar with the trail and don't go the long way. Again, the box is well hidden, and intact.
<br/>
<br/>Our last stop, The Eager Beaver, was at the beginning end of the Norwottuck Rail Trail, in a little place called the Brickyard Conservation Area. No problem finding the box, and it is intact, though it does not have an ink pad or a writing stick, and only has one paper left describing what it is. I must agree with one of the previous visitors, however. The box location is kind of creepy, right next to an abandoned building that clearly gets a lot of use as a party spot. If you go for this box, best make it early in the day, or not on a weekend. There was a fairly recently used fire pit inside the building, as we could tell since the coals were still warm. 
<br/>
<br/>Happy Stamping!
<br/>
