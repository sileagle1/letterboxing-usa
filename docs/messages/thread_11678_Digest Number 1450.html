months yet as we live in Ct. but visit Pa. once or twice a year. <br/>
Being farmers  we love to come to God's green acre!  Be sure that I <br/>
will place another the next time I'm there. We are thinking of going <br/>
to the Doylestown gather enroute to  Bird in Hand in June. Maybe we <br/>
will meet and get an exchange . I will have Cowboy my 9 year old with <br/>
me. Happy boxing glad the kids liked it. Leader of the Pack - carol&gt;<br/>
Well, now you will all know we are really new to this....what is a "gather" and what is an "exchange" and we would definitely love to participate if they involve more letterboxing!!!!  <br/>
We noticed that there are quite a few (understatement!) boxes up in Connecticut and are hoping to meet some of our friends from Maine there over the summer (it's halfway) to box together...I have my best friend really hooked but she has not been able to get out due to the snow!<br/>
