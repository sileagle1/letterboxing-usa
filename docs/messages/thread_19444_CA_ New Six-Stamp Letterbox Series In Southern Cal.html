&gt;Subject:  California Outlaws<br/>
&gt;Buzzard,<br/>
&gt;Sierra Sally just posted her outlaw letterbox, where's yours?<br/>
&gt;Don<br/>
<br/>
Well, it certainly has taken me a while to plant my "outlaw <br/>
letterbox."  Perhaps as an angelino, I felt the need to take a real <br/>
cinemagraphic angle to the subject. This letterbox series traces the <br/>
movements on a particular day of Tiburcio Vasquez, 19th century <br/>
California's most famous bandito.  This series was first inspired by <br/>
a private email from Don (of Don &amp; Gwen fame) who mentioned that he <br/>
was planting a Tiburcio Vasqeuz letterbox.  When I read this, I <br/>
remembered from my own history lessons that Tiburcio's last raid had <br/>
happened in my own back yard in Pasadena, and I became determined to <br/>
plant my own Tiburcio letterbox series.  Much thanks to Don for the <br/>
inspiration, and to my wife, the "French Hen," for her invaluable <br/>
editing.  The clues are now finally posted on letterboxing.org. I <br/>
hope everyone enjoys the series.<br/>
