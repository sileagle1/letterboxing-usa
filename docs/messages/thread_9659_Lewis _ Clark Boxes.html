That series is actually a series of mystery boxes, so you can find <br/>
them under the mystery letterboxes page.  Amanda (from Seattle!) has <br/>
hidden four so far, and plans to add more in the future.  The <br/>
official link from the letterboxing website is at <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/lbna/lewis1.htm but I know she's working <br/>
on her own website which is supposed to even include pictures of the <br/>
stamps.  (At least for the L&amp;C series--the others don't have stamp <br/>
images as I understand it.)  However, since I don't know if she's <br/>
ready to make it public yet, I'm not going to say where it is.  <br/>
She'll have to let everyone know when she's ready for the Grand <br/>
Debut.  =)<br/>
