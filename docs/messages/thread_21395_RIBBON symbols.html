The red ribbon has been for AIDS awareness for decades, and was the<br/>

ribbon, but not on the lapel). It gained a high profile when everyone<br/>

The blue ribbon as an electronic symbol is for free speech on the<br/>
Internet, and has been since before the arthritis foundation co-opted<br/>
it. Not that it can't be used for both-- there are many symbols that<br/>
get used for more than one thing. The pink ribbon and yellow ribbon<br/>
are not duplicated too often, and the red ribbon should similarly be<br/>
special because of its high profile, but a lot of other causes keep<br/>
trying to co-opt it as well.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, though, there are an infinite number of causes and a<br/>
finite number of colors.<br/>
<br/>
It might be neat to do a ribbon box, with a ribbon stamp, and everyone<br/>
visiting could bring the stamp ink color of choice and write what<br/>
cause that ribbon color represents and why it's important to them.<br/>
