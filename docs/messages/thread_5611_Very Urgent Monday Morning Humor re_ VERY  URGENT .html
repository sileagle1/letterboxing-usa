</p><p>See what you have started! Now, everyone will be doing the same thing!</p>
<p>The fields and forests will be filled with HUGE Rubbermaid totes filled with stacks of currency, a notebook and stamp (a "Paid"stamp, perhaps?)  Geo-cashing???? I wonder, how hard do you think it will be to hide these?  Would you need a pack mule or pick-up truck to move a hitchhiker? </p>
<p>Thanks Trey for some Monday morning levity!! Couldn't resist.

There is an account<br/>opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has<br/>operated on this account again. After going through<br/>some old files in the records, I discovered that if I<br/>do not remit this money out urgently it would be<br/>forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is<br/>Mr. Fernando Carlos, a foreigner, he was a miner at<br/>Kruger gold company, a geologist by profession, and he<br/>died since 1990. No other person knows about this<br/>account or any thing concerning it, the account has no<br/>other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as<br/>well that this company does not know anything about<br/>this account and the amount involved is (US$90<br/>million) Ninety million United States Dollars. I want<br/>to first transfer (US$45M) Forty Five million united<br/>states Dollars from this money into a safe foreigners<br/>account abroad before the rest. I am contacting you<br/>based on the fact that you are a foreigner because<br/>this money can only be approved for payment to a<br/>foreigner, more so it can not be approved by any local<br/>bank here, as this money is in US Dollars hence the<br/>former owner of this account is a foreigner too. I<br/>know that this proposal will come to you as a surprise<br/>as we don't know ourselves before, however I based my<br/>move on trust and God directive and we will still have<br/>to meet possibly, sign some agreement before the final<br/>transfer of the fund into any of your<br/>chosendesignatedbank account.<br/>Please treat with utmost confidentiality.<br/><br/>Expecting your urgent response.<br/><br/>Best Regards,<br/>PETER BENSON<br/><br/><br/><br/>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup<br/><a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com</a><br/></tt><br/><br/><tt>To unsubscribe: mailto:letterbox-usa-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br/>List info, archives, etc: <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html">http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html</a><br/></tt><br/><br/><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
