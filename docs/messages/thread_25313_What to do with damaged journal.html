I checked on one of my boxes today after not looking at it since I put it there in 2007 and found that it was pretty waterlogged.  I took it home and made a new journal, etc and repackaged the box.<br/>
<br/>
I took all the pages out of the old journal and dried them, but don't know what I should do with them.  It seems a shame to throw them out.<br/>
Do people scan them and put them online?<br/>
<br/>
I made a bunch of boxes years ago, but when I became really interested in birding, I put all my time into that.  Once in a while someone will let me know that a box need replacing or repair.<br/>
<br/>
Finding that box today was fun...there was actually a fresh pile of Downy Woodpecker feathers all over it...some hawk must have had breakfast in the tree above.  I taped one of the feathers into the new journal.<br/>

I did take a picture of some of the feathers on the letterbox (it's Baltimore Oriole (LbNA # 35059)in Fairhaven Mass.<br/>

I had a Feathers identification book and narrowed it to a Downy or a Hairy Woodpecker.<br/>

I would put the old pages in a small evelope with a note in a mini plastic baggie. The note is of your choice.  <br/>
You can just keep them for yourself in a letterbox scrap book.<br/>

Is there room to put some of the dried pages back into the box?  Sometimes<br/>
 like to look through old logbooks and see who logged the find and how<br/>
ong ago it was.  It is kind of neat to find a box with logs from years<br/>

 Hi!<br/>

 I checked on one of my boxes today after not looking at it since I put it<br/>
 there in 2007 and found that it was pretty waterlogged. I took it home and<br/>
 made a new journal, etc and repackaged the box.<br/>

 I made a bunch of boxes years ago, but when I became really interested in<br/>
 birding, I put all my time into that. Once in a while someone will let me<br/>
 know that a box need replacing or repair.<br/>

 Finding that box today was fun...there was actually a fresh pile of Downy<br/>

that has lived thru many challenges <br/>
but did fill up LOGBOOK 1<br/>

and was replaced <br/>
we entered the original info <br/>
placement date, etc. in LOGBOOK 2<br/>
<br/>
but also entered <br/>
the name and date of FIRST FINDER <br/>
on first page of LOGBOOK 2<br/>
<br/>
seeing the personal stamps and activity in a logbook <br/>
is one of the exciting parts about LBing<br/>
but i figure is a 2nd logbook is needed<br/>
then there would soon be finders stamps entered<br/>
and that would be good enough<br/>

&gt; I would put the old pages in a small evelope with a note in a mini plastic baggie. The note is of your choice.  <br/>
&gt; You can just keep them for yourself in a letterbox scrap book.<br/>

&gt; Is there room to put some of the dried pages back into the box?  Sometimes<br/>
&gt;  like to look through old logbooks and see who logged the find and how<br/>
&gt; ong ago it was.  It is kind of neat to find a box with logs from years<br/>
&gt; go.  8^)<br/>

&gt;  Hi!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I checked on one of my boxes today after not looking at it since I put it<br/>
&gt;  there in 2007 and found that it was pretty waterlogged. I took it home and<br/>
&gt;  made a new journal, etc and repackaged the box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I took all the pages out of the old journal and dried them, but don't know<br/>
&gt;  what I should do with them. It seems a shame to throw them out.<br/>
&gt;  Do people scan them and put them online?<br/>
