First of all my heart is breaking for you.  This badness stuff tends <br/>
to come in waves but it will eventually get better.<br/>
Side note: as a pessimist I personally believe it generally gets <br/>
worse before it gets better (ain't I a fountain of hope...).  Now, <br/>
having dropped that bomb:  it makes it easier for me to handle the <br/>
tribulations just 'cuz I expect the worst.  If the worst doesn't <br/>
happen that's a pleasant surprise... :rolleyes:  Hey, it works for me!<br/>
<br/>
In 2003 I lost my Alabama.  She was "only" a dog, a first anniversary <br/>
gift (1991) from my cat-loving wife, and I miss her still.  Don't kid <br/>
yourself, they become family.  I started 'boxing in Nov. '05, In <br/>
Jan. '06 I planted my first letterbox:  Alabama's Getaway.  It means <br/>
a lot to me to remember my Al'ie in this way, and share a place with <br/>
others that we enjoyed together many, many times over the years.  <br/>
<br/>
My vote is to memorialise Rocky with his own letterbox; let the <br/>
healing begin.<br/>
