                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry folks, but we werent able to get permission to place the second Polish box at the spot wed hoped for.  Over the past couple of weeks, we had made several trips at different times to try to talk to the director who always seemed to be out to lunch!  When we finally did get to see her, not only was she extremely rude but it turns out that the historic object that linked to our clues, stamp and Polish person and that we wished to show you guys - formerly attached to the oldest lending library in America - is now lying heaped behind the hedge like a piece of junk!  So much for treating historical artifacts and people with respect and so much for asking permission!We will just have to find a spot near where the historic artifact in question served its original purpose.  If you can guess what we are talking about, youre halfway to solving part 2 of our Polish mystery.  But, for now youll just have to wait until we can get out that way to place that second box.Meanwhile, we did go out to check on the first Polish box this past weekend and are very pleased that it has already been found by the Drews and Dan, Melissa and Max (who apparently understands Polish as our dog, Victor, once did!)  We would like to warn anyone else who has deciphered the clues and is thinking of heading out that way that there is presently some construction going on in the parking lot, and you might have to park outside and walk an additional 10 minutes to get in there.  Once you find your way down to the pond, though, the rest of the clues should work just fine, if you remember that you are looking for resztki, and not a whole stone wall!  Just make sure you are near the pond where Peter picked a PECK of Polish pickles!  As for Polish jokes, blonde jokes, and any of that ilk - dont worry - we are not the kind of folks who like make them about other people.  Aili, in correcting the bearing for the Round Table letterbox, wrote something about that being her natural hair color (see message #8158), we thought that she was perhaps making a blonde joke about HERSELF!  No offense intended, but having little else to go on except for tiny hints like that to try to recognize folks that wed never seen before at the Fall Gathering, we mistakenly thought that her hair might be a lighter shade that it actually turned out to be!  Not really surprising though, believe it or not, I, too, was once a blonde baby (and I still have one of my  golden curls in a black locket to prove it!), even though Ward Leonard recently called me raven haired!  So whos to say?Hope you are all having fun letterboxing - whatever your hair color or ethnicity may be!Wanda<br/>
