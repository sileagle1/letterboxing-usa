  I've found a box with water inside and contents soggy with water <br/>
inside all of the bags.<br/>
<br/>
  Should I just contact the owner and replace as best as possible on the <br/>
spot (Which I did).. or should I take them home and dry the papers <br/>
properly and replace ASAP?<br/>

<br/>
  Another question about water. What is the best method to keep the <br/>
contents as dry as possible?<br/>
<br/>
  I assume that moisture enters a sealed box as barometric pressure <br/>
changes and the 'sealed' box breathes in and out through the seal <br/>
trapping moisture inside which builds up into a big puddle.   Moisture <br/>
even enters double bag systems leaving the papers damp.<br/>
<br/>
  Perhaps there is, or should be a rule of thumb for box maintenance <br/>
such as once a year as many of my finds are nearly 4 years old.<br/>

<br/>
It's true, ultimately there's no way to keep out moisture.  One thing<br/>
that would help would be to add desicants (sp?) to the box when you<br/>
place them or do maintenance.  These are the things in shoe boxes,<br/>
pill bottles etc.  I believe you can buy them, but you could also ask<br/>
your local pharmacist to save them.  You would believe how many they<br/>
throw away in a day.<br/>
<br/>
You're right about routine maintenance being important.  However, some<br/>
place them in far away places and can't make it back.  That's why it's<br/>
so great that some people adopt other people's boxes.<br/>

several years with no accidental finds would be easy.   I know <br/>
dessicate packs would help provided that you change them regularly and <br/>
many folks buy the stuff in bulk for drying flowers.<br/>

    Although I stumble upon things very frequently, especially old <br/>
balloons and such, not counting the endless bottles, cans and shotgun <br/>
shells.  I've found two ink pens, a lens cap and two balloons this <br/>
weekend alone in the woods off-trail.<br/>
