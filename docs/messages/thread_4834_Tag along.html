That's Martha Stewart's peanut butter girl scout cookie recipe!<br/>
<br/>
No no no...it's that pesky Drew family and their pushy habit of <br/>
poaching on other people's great hikes and adding a letterbox of <br/>
their own along the trail.<br/>

Thanks for the info, but I am still confused. This past weekend I hit <br/>
a few boxes and 1 of them had a stamp in it and in the log book was a <br/>
note that said Tag along next to the imprint of the 2nd stamp in the <br/>
book. There were no other clues in the box. so is the stamp just an <br/>
added bonus in that box, or once you find the second stamp are you <br/>
suppose to move it to another box? Kind of like a HH? Please help me <br/>
understand, I don't want to do something wrong. <br/>
