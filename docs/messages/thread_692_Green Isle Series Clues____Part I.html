                    <div class="plaintext-content">Directions:  From Heritage Hill, turn left onto<br/>
Webster Ave.  Turn Right at the Second Set of Stop<br/>
Lights.  This is St. Joseph Street.  Follow this to<br/>
the corner of East River Drive.  It will be the First<br/>
Intersection after the Stop Sign.  Park anywhere near<br/>
the lamp post.  This will be your starting point for<br/>
the first of four boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Box A: When looking at lamp post on the corner of E.<br/>
River Drive and St. Joseph, in the distance there<br/>
should be two grouping of trees.  Nestled amoungst<br/>
those is this box.  Good Luck on your journey.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Now drive your car onto E. River Drive. <br/>
Follow it until Allouez Ave.  (This will be a Stop<br/>
Sign.)  Turn Left onto Allouez Ave.  There on your<br/>
Right side you will see a car park, gravel, waiting<br/>
for you to take the "Riverwalk." Park there to find<br/>
the next three boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Box F: Walk over the bridge to the paved path on your<br/>
Right side.  Walk path to the Wood Plank Path.  There<br/>
are some rocks and wood pieces on right side.  Under<br/>
the path is this box.  <br/>
Box B:  Follow the path furthur.  You will cross a few<br/>
more wooden plank paths.  When you are on the last<br/>
wooden plank path before the bridge to take you into<br/>
the park proper, on your Left there are some wonderful<br/>
trees.  Just before this path ends you will find the<br/>
box underneath yourself.  <br/>
Box G:  Walk over the bridge.  Continue on the paved<br/>
path to right.  20 paces from the grouping of three<br/>
spring bars on their Via Course, you will see a tree<br/>
at about 2 o'clock.  Walk towards that tree and<br/>
underneath it, the box is stashed away.<br/>
<br/>
This is the first four.  You need to have a grid on<br/>
your paper that is two columns of four spaces.  On the<br/>
sides of the paper they should be marked like this:  <br/>
A  B     Each box has a letter that correspondes to a<br/>
C  D    place in the grid.  The picture you make is<br/>
the<br/>
E  F    surprise.  Enjoy.  <br/>
G  H     Next four are continued....<br/>
