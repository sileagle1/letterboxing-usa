                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh my gosh!  I'm sure it was a scary experience.  I remember as kids <br/>
my mom pointing out this mucky place along the road where she used to <br/>
live when she was young.  She said it was "sinking sand" and there <br/>
were entire horses and cars buried there.  That's what would have <br/>
been going through my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you got out okay and hopefully it won't make the news.  OldShoe <br/>
is saying, "see I told you this is a dangerous hobby" (referring back <br/>
to our Chicago Underground experiences).  Despite how serious the <br/>
situation was at the time, I am laughing at the way you told the <br/>
story.  Put on some thick purple socks and cuddle up with a warm cup <br/>
of cocoa!<br/>

<br/>
What a day for you!  Where were you?  I feel so awful for you!  I'm very glad you had your whistle with you.  Next time you head out letterboxing, grab the cell phone and call me!  We can get stuck in the mud together!<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you are ok!<br/>

You need to find a safer hobbie.  Perhaps skiing, or sky-diving, or BASE junping, or motorcycle racing.<br/>
<br/>
This letterboxing is just way too dangerous.<br/>

a stupid thing. It was at Scott,s Cove at Howard Ducketts Watershed.  <br/>
This was a plant that never made it to the map page. I found it on <br/>
message # 16343.<br/>
     I won't be going back, that's for sure. The Turtle and I are <br/>
headed to Savage Mill today. She keeps asking  "are you sure you want <br/>
to do this so soon?" <br/>
     Squizon (Suzanne) asked if I told them I had 2 beautiful <br/>
daughters at home (since I'm not a Jewish mother it never crossed my <br/>
mind). I told her where she could get rescued by the handsome <br/>
men!                  <br/>
