Since I have planned many trips over the years I agreed to provide some itineraries for him to use. The result is a website called Trips To Go that offers free detail trip plans for U.S. and Canada with fun activities, directions and links for more information. Since many of you like to travel I thought you might like to check it out and possibly use some of them. I don't mention specific letterboxes in the trips but many of the places do have letterboxes and you could search LBNA and/or AQ for them. There are only about 10 trips at this time since they take quite a bit of effort to produce, but I plan to add more so if you don't see one you like check again later. Here is the link:<br/>

I snuck a peek at it, and I have only one word to say:<br/>
<br/>
EXCELLENT!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Silver Eagle, and pass it on to your son, Son of Silver Eagle.<br/>

Didn't take too much time to look because I need to get to work, but I've bookmarked your site and hope to spend more time there soon.  I'm old enough to see retirement on the horizon and have always talked about the road trips we want to take when we no longer have to be tied to our business.  Or when we can make our business truly mobile.  A lot of work has obviously gone into your site - congratulations.  Hope it gets a lot of hits.<br/>
