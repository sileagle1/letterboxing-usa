<br/>
Just got back from Texas.  I placed three boxes... all are easy to<br/>
find.  Because they're so close to the road, please make sure you're<br/>
not seen getting the box.  I would have made them harder, but I<br/>
didn't want anybody getting bitten by rattlers... you shouldn't need<br/>
snake-proof boots to find these.  On my return trip, the airline<br/>
managed to loose the box my log book, personal stamp and carving<br/>
stuff was in, but I had the clues in my carry-on, thank goodness.  So<br/>
here they are, with apologies for the simplicity.<br/>
