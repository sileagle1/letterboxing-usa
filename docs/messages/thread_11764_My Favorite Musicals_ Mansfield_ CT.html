                    <div class="plaintext-content"> I found 4 more of this 21 box series today, to add to the 5 stamps I <br/>
aquired on March 29th.  This preserve is incredibly beautiful.  Pink <br/>
Trotters spent so much time cleverly carving the stamps and hiding <br/>
the boxes! <br/>
 I still cannot find Louisa. "raised arms" does mean a tree with two <br/>
upraised branches, right?<br/>
  Now for the bad news:  Could someone please let Pink Trotters know <br/>
that Brigitta's box was totally cracked and wet? I think the log book <br/>
will dry out alright but the stamp pad will probalby need replacing. <br/>
I dried everthing off and placed the log and stamp in a new ziplock. <br/>
I then placed the broken box and ziplock in a plastic grocery bag, <br/>
wrapped well and rehid. <br/>
  Climb Every Mountain is in worse shape. The box did not appear to <br/>
be broken but it was totally full of green (ink) water. I did not <br/>
have any dry paper towels left..did the best I could. Placed the <br/>
stamp and log book (probably can't be saved) in a ziplock bag and <br/>
wrapped it all in another plastic grocery bag.  Well, my fingernails <br/>
have a lovely green tint to them, but I don't mind in the least.  <br/>
Last people to stamp in at these boxes was a day or so before <br/>
Christmas!<br/>
