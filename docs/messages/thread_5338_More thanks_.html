<div>Just wanted to add our thanks to Aili and Bruce for the 
great time at Sleeping Giant on Saturday.  The weather couldn't have been 
better, and the turnout was amazing.  It was great to see old friends 
again, Jay, Annie, Alan (from Axtown) and of course Aili and Bruce.  We 
also enjoyed meeting so many new boxers both local, and from out of state, in 
some cases way out of state :)  Thanks Jay for the 2 easy boxes you placed 
for the gathering.  We are eagerly planning a day hike to find the others 
once Dan's leg is healed.  Alan, it was great to finally meet you.  We 
are looking forward to your gathering in the summer.  It sounds like a 
blast!!  Enjoyed meeting the big group of boxers at the Giant's BBQ before 
heading home for the night.  Yaker- kayak boxes coming soon, we 
promise!  Thanks again,</div>
<div>        Melissa and 
Dan</div>

<div>P.S.  Next time we'll bring 
Max!</div></body></html>
