   Several Mass boxes listed as "Abandoned" either connect to an <br/>
active website that provides contact information or list an email <br/>
address in the clues.<br/>
   If someone is maintaining the clues on their website, I don't <br/>
understand how that can be deemed abandonment. <br/>
   Anyway, I would be happy to email the people in eastern MA to try <br/>
to get them to register, but I don't know what to say. That is, I <br/>
have no idea how they would go about reclaiming their abandoned box.<br/>
    Perhaps you could post these instructions so those of willing to <br/>
try to to contact the placers can provide helpful information to them.<br/>
    Also would appreciate instructions on how to "adopt" an abandoned <br/>
box, if that is being permitted.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Quite often the email addresses in these clues are old and out-of-<br/>
date. This has been a problem in the past when a box is damaged and <br/>
I try to email the placer. They have gotten a new email address and <br/>
have dropped out of the letterboxing world. <br/>
