<br/>
      I searched the message board for posts about it and only found a couple right after it was released in Dec. 2002, nothing since then. Moonstonebaby was the one who requested it first. Does anyone know if she got it, is she still boxing?  <br/>
<br/>
      I am willing to compile the mailing lists for both F-100 and F-500 (which I have started with the address I have been sent), but I need to know if these stamps still exist. If no-one knows where they are, I'll carve new ones. If they are out there, I can add the lists to the boxes if they get sent my way. If they don't turn up, I'll carve new ones and release them with the lists.<br/>
