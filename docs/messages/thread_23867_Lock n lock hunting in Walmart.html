So, Mosey are you going to post "clues" to these hidden LBs inside Walmart for us? :o)<br/>

So YOU'RE the one who has been making my life hell at Wal-Mart?  It's <br/>
a pain in the but being a geocacher/letterboxer AND work at Wally <br/>
World. I KNOW where all the good stuff is hidden and where to find <br/>
all of the stolen items as well.  Now KNOCK IT OFF..or I'll charge <br/>
you twice for something and forget to correct my error....oops. ;-)<br/>
