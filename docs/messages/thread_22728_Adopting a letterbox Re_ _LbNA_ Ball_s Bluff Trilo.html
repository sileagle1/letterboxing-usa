logbook. By adopting a box the adopter becomes the contact person. For<br/>
me (I've placed 23 LBs) feedback is important. It helps me maintain<br/>
the box(es) and tweak the clues. Positive feedback tends to inspire me<br/>
to place more boxes. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Bravo for your offer to adopt.  If we don't take care of abandoned <br/>
&gt; (or missing) boxes (I think) the sport/hobby will deteriorate.   No <br/>
&gt; matter what we all think, only a few people have access to the <br/>
&gt; database.  Since they seem to read the posts, I will support you with <br/>
&gt; an opinion for them:<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; If the "Apple Dumplings" have not responded after 10 days - and have <br/>
&gt; obviously not maintained their boxes - please allow adoption.  Morgun<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think replacing a logbook could certainly be accomplished without <br/>
&gt; going through the process of switching ownership via adoption of the <br/>
&gt; letterbox. Hopefully any finder of our letterboxes would do a little <br/>
&gt; bit of maintenance without trying to set up adoption. How do you know <br/>
&gt; this box is abandoned? Maybe the placer is on vacation. If you are <br/>
&gt; looking to adopt a letterbox why not check out the basement an adopt <br/>
&gt; one. Those letterboxes have been orphans for some time.<br/>
