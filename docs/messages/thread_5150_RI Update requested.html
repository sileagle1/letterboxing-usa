<br/>
AD and I did the Great swamp monument and Asa pond<br/>
ones when she was up in March.  I haven't heard that<br/>
they are not still there, and both are nice hikes. <br/>
Also, don't forget about the Hills Are Alive series on<br/>
the bike path that lays right between the two sites<br/>
;o)  I remember hearing you had done the first few in<br/>
the series - as did I.  All the activity out there<br/>
this time of year certianly adds to the challange ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!!<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did Great Swamp Monument this past Sunday (April 21) and it was <br/>
alive &amp; well.  I did the Asa Pond boxes &amp; the Four Seasons boxes <br/>
about 4 weeks ago and they were in good shape then.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for other places to go in RI I also did the Black <br/>
Farm boxes &amp; Carolina South this past Sunday.  Black Farm is a pretty <br/>
nice place to walk (My first time there)  I did the Carolina North <br/>
boxes on Easter sunday and they were ok then.<br/>
<br/>
If you have not done the new Hills Are Alive letterboxes on the South <br/>
County bike path you should.  I did these this past Sunday too.  <br/>
There are 7 boxes in 4 miles.  On a bike it's a breeze.  The last box <br/>
ends by the Asa Pond boxes so you could combine those into one <br/>
hike/bike.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>

Thanks for the information.  Actually went back and finished the Hills are Alive three weeks ago.  Then into the letterboxing drought for me.  But definitely can't pass up a great Saturday like tomorrow.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing<br/>
