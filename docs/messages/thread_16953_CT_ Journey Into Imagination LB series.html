not sure it had been sealed properly), and "Green Eggs and Ham box is <br/>
badly cracked (Contents are fine). I Dried out the first with my <br/>
emergency set of dry socks:), but did not have a back up box for the <br/>
other. Anyone planning on doing these boxes, please consider bringing <br/>
a replacement box to help maintain this wonderful series. Thanks to <br/>
all who made this series possible! This is a special series for young <br/>
and old. We completed all boxes today and had a wonderful on-trail <br/>
exchange with the D+C's from Mass. (Nice meeting you guys!)Wish we <br/>
could box again tomorrow but I have to revert back to a nurse and <br/>
work. Happy trails to all!<br/>
