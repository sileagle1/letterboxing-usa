<br/>
This was last seen the day after I planted her in CT, headed toward <br/>
VA.  I emailed the person who picked her up some time ago, but <br/>
haven't received any response so frankly, I don't even know if or <br/>
where she was planted.<br/>
<br/>
If you HAVE come across her at all please let me know- the kids are <br/>
very curious as to whether or not she has disappeared into the ether <br/>
having never gotten off on her journey. :(<br/>
