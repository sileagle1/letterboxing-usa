                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well folks, here we go!  The list has been randomized and set, the signup's turned off, the letterbox is packed away, safe and snug and it's in the mail today!  <br/>
<br/>
First off, I implore everyone receiving this letterbox to keep me updated with the status, received, sent off, etc, etc. Realizing that it's going to take approx 80 weeks by my calculations to complete the trip, I would like to make sure that everyone contacts me when they receive the box and when they send it on to the next.  I'm verifying the addresses now so will have it out as soon as that is finished.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of thoughts for shipping....<br/>
<br/>
The United States Postal Service (www.usps.gov) can ship this box that this PLB will be in, from Tacoma, to Maine in 3 days using Priority Mail for $5.75 with no tracking or confirmation.<br/>
<br/>
United Parcel Service (www.ups.com) can send the box that this PLB will be in, from Tacoma, to Maine in 5 days using UPS Ground for $7.11 or in 3 days for $10.00 which includes the ability to track it online.  Given the length of time that this is going to be in transit, and given that the USPS doesn't do the best job of returning mail, I'm going to suggest that you send this box via UPS as is will allow you to track it across country, and, if you send me the tracking number, I can keep it updated on the website.<br/>
<br/>
I'm making the box as sturdy as possible, you should be able to reuse the box over and over as long as it's not destroyed by the shipping.<br/>
<br/>
This is only a recommendation and not a direction on how to ship this item.<br/>

P.S. I'm sending this letter to the national list AND individually to the recipients of the box to ensure that everyone gets it.<br/>

in line at the Post office.  You just walk right up to the counter <br/>
and drop the box with postage already on it! =]  <br/>
