     new to letterboxing and have been having a ball.  Didn't realize there <br/>
where so many in our area!  Just wanted to say thanks to all those folks out <br/>
there creating the letterboxes - can't wait to do our first one!  <br/>
    Our first one found was Garrison Hill, lived in the area for quite some <br/>
time and never been over there - quite the view!  Thanks Red Rover.  We've also <br/>
had some success with Seahorse,  Portsmouth Harbor Light, Fort Foster and Sea <br/>
Song Mystery, also the State of Maine.  Funny how some of the stamps in the <br/>
log books are starting to look familiar!  We've found all these over the past <br/>
month or two and all where in good condition - although the Sea Song Mystery <br/>
was somewhat soggy!  Dried it out as best we could.<br/>
    Went looking for Take Refuge, but alas, no prize.  Has anyone found this <br/>
one recently?  Attempted Nubble and the Mouser, but the spot was way too busy <br/>
that day.  Will have to go back another time.  Thinking about doing Live Free <br/>
or Die and Adam's Point next, anyone been to either of these recently?  So <br/>
thanks for all you Planters out there.  Hope to join your ranks soon!<br/>

My family are extreme newbies in that we have only gone out once and unfortunately <br/>
it was for the Take Refuge (I and II) boxes.  We could not find either of them and one <br/>
seemed too easy not to find if it was there.  I tried contacting the placer of the boxes <br/>
but have not been contacted yet.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to the area! I'm in southern Maine, so not far from you and have <br/>
hit many of the seacoast NH ones. You've probably even seen my stamp in <br/>
a lot of the log books since I've only been doing this for about 2 <br/>
months. I'm so glad there are new folks getting out there and I hope <br/>
you'll hide some boxes of your own soon.<br/>
There have been many, many missing reports for Take Refuge, and I tried <br/>
contacting the placer several times with no luck. If anyone e-mails you <br/>
that they have found it, please do let me know. We did Live Free or Die <br/>
and Adam's Point in August I think and both were there, though Adam's <br/>
point is a geocache as well and wasn't hidden quite where it was <br/>
supposed to be. According to the logbook, one of the geocachers decided <br/>
to rehide it in a better spot.<br/>
If you join the yahoo group NewAgeLetterboxing, there is a database <br/>
listing when the boxes were last found and their condition. It might be <br/>
helpful to you since I post to that database and am pretty good about <br/>
posting the boxes I visit. E-mail me offlist if you want more info.<br/>
Happy boxing! Hope to meet you on the trails sometime. If you happen to <br/>
do the Laudholm Quest boxes (which a friend of mine - Phyto - carved) <br/>
stop by the visit center and ask for the Education Director - that would <br/>
be me and you might just get an exchange out of it!<br/>

Please do not be discouraged- there are plenty of other great boxes in <br/>
your area. Just get out there and try some more and enjoy the fall <br/>
foliage. Once you find one, you'll be addicted- I'm sure of it!<br/>

Is there no system in place where a Box can be put on "Hold" or somehow marked on <br/>
the LbNA website as being "Potentially Missing" even if the placer cannot be <br/>
contacted?  It seems the list would soon be full of unkept boxes simply  because the <br/>
placer lost interest or was otherwise unable to keep up to date.<br/>
