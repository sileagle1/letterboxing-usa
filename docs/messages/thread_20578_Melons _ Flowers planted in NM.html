Just wanted to say we're back from our annual CDT volunteer work trip in <br/>
New Mexico (just in time for the Mansfield Monster Mash in CT!).  We built <br/>
several new miles of hiking trail, with only a little time left over for letterboxing.  <br/>
But, we did manage to find a couple of hitchers ("The Hunter" and "The Jolly <br/>
Roger") and plant a couple of boxes of Laurette's ("Simple Pleasures" and <br/>
"Sandia Picnic") in some pretty special places while we were out there, too!  <br/>
Clues will be coming out soon.  Meanwhile, hope to see a lot of folks <br/>
tomorrow at the MMM!<br/>
