<br/>
Old Blue is a Civil War buff. I am one by osmosis.  It happened when we <br/>
visited Gettysburg the first time. Okay, the outskirts of the battlefield is a <br/>
little commercial but, know this: driving or walking through that beautiful <br/>
battlefield just about any time of the year (dogwood and redbud in the spring, <br/>
autumnal spender in the fall) reading any of the 1200 monuments, walking the lines <br/>
where so many gave their young lives, it WILL change you. You will feel “it” <br/>
all around you. Here is the opportunity to feel the spirits which still reside <br/>
there AND find a letterbox in the process. <br/>
<br/>
This box is dedicated to John Otto of the 11th Indiana Battery, commander of <br/>
same and Great-Great Grandfather of Old Blue. <br/>
<br/>
Locate the monument at the corner of Taneytown Rd and Steinwehr Ave., and <br/>
note the state for which the monument is dedicated. Next, go to the Confederate <br/>
Avenue where Ewell’s Corp was positioned during the battle at Getysburg and <br/>
find an information marker showing “The Barb of the Hook”. (The visitor’s center <br/>
has maps and is a cool place to learn stuff! Or, you can look in any Civil <br/>
War book under Ewell and find this information. Also, hiring one of the <br/>
extremely knowledgeable guides for a couple of hours is money well spent!) <br/>
<br/>
Proceed to the hill that IS the Barb and find the Greene monument. There are <br/>
2 trail leading down the hill from this point. Remember the state on the <br/>
monument we told you to locate? Make your way down the correct trail to that state’<br/>
s monument. Proceed on the trail to J.G. Palmer’s stone then continue over the <br/>
fallen log and on down the hill (about 70 paces from the stone). <br/>
<br/>
Just about at the bottom of this ravine, look to your right and you will see <br/>
a big outcropping of moss-covered rock. Tromp down and around said rock and up <br/>
the other side. On the uphill and east side of this big rock the Lb is hidden <br/>
well under 3 rocks. (Don’t forget to replace these rocks!)<br/>
<br/>

progress! Thanks!!<br/>
