at Bardwell Lake, just south of Dallas in Ellis<br/>
County.<br/>
<br/>
This is a Barnraising, sort of a reverse gathering -<br/>
rather than getting together to find all the boxes in<br/>
a given area, we are getting together to hide boxes in<br/>
a given area that is sorely in need of boxes!<br/>
<br/>
While we would love to see fellow boxers from anywhere<br/>
come to the gathering, we realize some of y'all may<br/>
want to participate but can't make the trip.  That's<br/>
fine - we're accepting boxes from absentee boxers to<br/>
be planted during the gathering.  <br/>
<br/>
We are also doing a recipe exchange - boxers are<br/>
encouraged to bring their favorite recipe and stamp it<br/>
with their personal stamp to make a double exchange -<br/>
good food and good stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
For more information, email me directly offlist, or go<br/>
