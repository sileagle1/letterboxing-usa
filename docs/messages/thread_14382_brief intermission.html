This morning, I met up with Pam (Dancin' Feet) at a Dunkin' Donuts, then we headed to the Gilson Road Cemetary to meet up with friends of hers: Tim (Red-Eyed Dragon) and his mother, Diane (Two Step Lover).<br/>
We found the NH Ghosts box (my first find!) and the Gilson Road Cemetary box as well (Pam replaced the broken pencil in the box with a pen). Pam and I then headed up to Mine Falls Park so that she could show me the back way into the park and bring me to where I could pick up the clues and follow them, entrance from which the clues are written is closed for construction.<br/>
All three boxes were in great condition.<br/>
<br/>
I'm revising my plans for the day to head to the Acton/Concord/Littleton area, as Hillsboro is a bit far for me to go to today.<br/>
<br/>
I'll check back in when I get home again.<br/>
<br/>
:)<br/>
