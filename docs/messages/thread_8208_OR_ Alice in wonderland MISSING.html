                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, today was depressing. I went out and checked on my two babies today. <br/>
While the little peoples box is safe and slowly filling up, it seems that <br/>
Alice lasted little more then a month.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if i will replace this box or not. The people who have stamped <br/>
in know that it was a very intricate stamp. It took me three weeks to make <br/>
and i just don't know if i have the heart to put that much energy into a <br/>
stamp that has disappeared once already. Until i make up my mind could the <br/>
web-masters simply mark it as missing?<br/>
<br/>
While i didn't find the stamp(!!!) or box i did find parts of the logbook. <br/>
Luckily it seems that most of the stamped pages are a little wet but still <br/>
intact.<br/>
<br/>
If you stamped in after September 28th then i don't have your entry.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone who stamped in a left such nice notes. Its the little <br/>
things like this that make planting boxes worthwhile.<br/>

If I could recarve it, would you like ME to do it for you?  It's not <br/>
the same as it being YOUR stamp, but at least you wouldn't have to <br/>
put another three weeks into it!  (Speaking from experience, it's <br/>
usually faster every time you carve it, though!)<br/>

I will probably end up re-carving it if there are actually people who want <br/>

One of our group also left the Canadian Hitch Hiker in the box, so I<br/>
presume that it too is missing in action. Double Drag... The hiding<br/>
place was a bit risky and we all commented that we were surprised that<br/>
it hadn't been vandalized or soaked by a good rain. Those bowls in<br/>
trees make great hiding places as well as pools of water. By all<br/>
means, recarve your beautiful stamp and rehide it somewhere no<br/>
pinheads will ever find it by accident. Funhog<br/>

Sorry to hear your box is gone.  We've been through that a few times <br/>
ourselves, and if you remember you once found a box that belong to <br/>
us "empty".  Sigh!  Just think of it as joining in on the ever <br/>
growing list of "collectors stamps", that were retrieved before <br/>
sudden box dissappearance.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I think the hiding place for the Alice stamp was good, <br/>
but the exposure of it to the rest-of-area was a bit high.  Since <br/>
there was only one basic way to retrieve it, doing so would cause <br/>
natural curiosity by any nearby observers.  Unfortunately, I guess it <br/>
got into bad hands from there.  <br/>
<br/>
But I'm sure you will carve many more great stamps in the future and <br/>
if you'd like to get together sometime, we can show you some methods <br/>
of stamp carving which will speed up your output time by loads.  Send <br/>
me a private email if you'd like to do this.<br/>
<br/>
Looking fwd to your future boxes and fun clues.<br/>
