Subject: [LbNA] New Favorite Ornaments Series in RI<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Happy New Year all!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just when most folks have taken down their Christmas trees<br/>
&gt; and put away their pretty ornaments, here I am putting out a<br/>
&gt; favorite ornaments series!!! (just  a little late, as usual :-) Actually,<br/>
&gt; I carved images of a few of my favorite ornaments (a cuckoo<br/>
&gt; clock, a mushroom and a pickle) while they were still hanging on<br/>
&gt; our tree, and thought it might be cool to place them amidst the<br/>
&gt; pines of Burlingame to hang out there for the rest of the year!  I'm<br/>
&gt; also hoping that other folks might have favorite ornaments of<br/>
&gt; their own that they might be willing to turn into stamp carvings to<br/>
&gt; help decorate the many pines of the Burlingame area (perhaps<br/>
&gt; in time for the annual Fall Gathering?)  We may not have the<br/>
&gt; extensively developed and marked trail systems of some of<br/>
&gt; those remarkable parks that we have visited elsewhere, but<br/>
&gt; Burlingame South is wide open for planting, with quite a few<br/>
&gt; unmarked trails as well, so please feel free to add on to this<br/>
&gt; series! (and I'm certainly willing to help out with planting, if<br/>
&gt; needed, since I'm still not much into carving!)  I did try my hand at<br/>
&gt; a little rocking horse ornament, but that has ended up as an<br/>
&gt; add-on at Chaney Ranch in Montville, CT - clues posted on our<br/>
&gt; webpage at<br/>
&gt; http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html#Box_43  Thanks<br/>
&gt; again to all who "decorate" the woods!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We think Curious Crane's idea about hanging "ornaments" from the <br/>
pines in "socks" is absolutely delightful! So far all of ours are <br/>
just under plain old rocks, but we'd be thrilled if anyone wants to <br/>
attempt other methods like that of discreetly decorating the woods! <br/>
Thanks for the interest!<br/>
