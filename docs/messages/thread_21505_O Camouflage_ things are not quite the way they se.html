No pressure...no pressure at all...I'm of the school of thought that LBing is a long-term project for me, so if you get around to it next year or the year after, then terrific!  It seems that of all things, most of my box hunting is in GA.  It's not like I'm in GA all that often.  However, it was there that I noticed that a particular planter paints his rubbermaids black (GA Guidestones, Tree that Owns Itself, et al) and that they blended in well.  Thought it was a nifty idea and this thread is sparking off all kinds of thoughts.<br/>

I have a faux box hidden in Georgia and have plans on several more <br/>
this year.  It's a natural object cast in cement with the box <br/>
inside.  <br/>
