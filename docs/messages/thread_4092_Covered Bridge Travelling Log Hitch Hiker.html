Stardate: Today, 1615.. Cache #5 for the day. We just had to do one more <br/>
since it was so close to the house!! Hi Guys, love the covered bridge and its <br/>
history. This is one of the remaining 3 or 4 left in the state. Very nice <br/>
little park. I finally left Hop a Long WTM along the side of the road and <br/>
brought my wife for this one. .... :-) Watch out for those stickers. ..... <br/>
The Traveling Log Book is on it's way to someplace. It will be interesting to <br/>
see where it ends up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS: We finally made it to a cache BEFORE Butch!!! Hi Butch. <br/>

FOUND April 14, 2001 by SWIAALB Kids at Zak's Cache at Pierre Marquette IL<br/>
AMAZINGLY WE FOUND IT! The kids got to the look-out and spotted what they <br/>
thought was the sleeping oak and a few real lizards! All six kids headed <br/>
straight to where we thought it was. But it wasn't there! We searched the <br/>
area for about 25 minutes and were about to give up. But the kids wanted to <br/>
look some more so we headed downhill in case the rain washed it out and found <br/>
it opened and tore to pieces in the brush. We figured it was from an animal <br/>
or a VERY BAD person who liked to eat plastic bags and paper! Luckily we had <br/>
a lot of kids to search for all the pieces, including the covered bridge <br/>
traveling log which was very chewed up ... plan on piecing it back together <br/>
and dropping it somewhere else very soon. Hopefully none the worse for wear <br/>
but with a little extra character! We were unsure of the original hiding <br/>
place so we hid it beside one of the two large fallen trees under leaves and <br/>
brush. ....... Thanks for a good and undisappointing hunt!   Plan on putting <br/>
the log back together and planting it somewhere 4/21/01.<br/>
