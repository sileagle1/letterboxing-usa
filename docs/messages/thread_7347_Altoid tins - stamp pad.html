<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>This rainy cool CT night, I am experimenting with an Altoid 
  tin trying to turn it into a letterbox. Small stamp (Factis eraser cut to 
  ~ 1.5"x1"x .5") fits. Handmade logbook fits. Weatherproofing will

<p>Does anyone have any other ideas? Has anyone ever made a stamp pad that

<br/>
I agree with irishtinker -- don't most letterboxers carry their own stamp <br/>
pads? I think that most of the boxes that I've found haven't had pads <br/>
anyway. Here in the Northeast, I don't think they hold up particularly well <br/>
through the winter.<br/>
<br/>
I would be inclined to leave the stamp pad out of the box, like the other <br/>
microletterboxes. You can always mention in the clue that the box doesn't <br/>
have a stamp pad.<br/>

in my boxes -- every letterboxer I know carries his or her own pad anyway.<br/>
If you decide not to include stamp pads in your small boxes, you can say<br/>
something in your clues like, "Make sure to bring your own stamp pad."<br/>
<br/>
Also, the "eye-shaped" pads you speak of are pigment ink -- sort of like<br/>
paint. I strongly recommend DYE-based ink pads instead (there are small ones<br/>
available at stamp stores). Pigment takes a long time to dry on both the<br/>
stamp and the paper, while dye dries on paper right away, yet still washes<br/>
off the stamp with plain water.<br/>
<br/>
Just my humble two cents!<br/>

I would definitely leave the pads in the boxes you've already placed, and<br/>
you can decide whether or not to put pads in future ones -- southern<br/>
Michigan weather (at least where I live) can get below zero, and that can't<br/>
be good for pads -- and frozen pads wouldnt' work anyway! I'd hate to see a<br/>
pad crack and thaw, destroying everything in a box, which is why I don't<br/>
generally put pads in my boxes... I do bag my pad and stamp separately from<br/>
the logbook, but still, if a pad cracked it would make a real mess!<br/>

Last year in southern New England winter was fairly mild so it didn't <br/>
matter, the winter before however we found boxes that we had to dig <br/>
out from a foot of snow or chip out of ice.  In both cases the ink <br/>
pads were fine but the pens usually didn't work.  <br/>

will rust over time?  I like your idea of stamped labels.  Another <br/>
possibility would be to include a small colored marker to use on the <br/>

if those non-rubberstampers would know to color on the stamp.  Have <br/>

<div><b>Subject:</b> [LbNA] Altoid tins - stamp 
  pad</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>This rainy cool CT night, I am experimenting with an Altoid 
  tin trying to turn it into a letterbox. Small stamp (Factis eraser cut to 
  ~ 1.5"x1"x .5") fits. Handmade logbook fits. Weatherproofing will 
  be accomplished by doubling up heavy-duty ziplocks.</p>
<p>Now...the problem. I have one of those small eye-shaped stamp pads, a 
  perfect size for this stamp. There is no way the pad will fit in the 
  tin. It is too high to enable me to close the cover. In the unique 
  scenario I am envisioning for this particular letterbox, a stamp pad separate 
  from and outside the tin is not really possible.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any other ideas? Has anyone ever made a stamp pad that 
  could be sized to fit and if so, out of what combination of materials?. Would 
  anyone compromise and stamp labels instead and include them rather than a 
  stamp pad? This seems somewhat non-traditional, but I guess if I 
  have to..........</p>
<p>Help!!!!!</p>

Being the Boy Scout Leader...I have to comment on the First Aid Kit...<br/>
If you remove the Band Aids from their wrapping...they are not sterile any <br/>
more...you should not remove them until they are ready to use...You could <br/>
always get some antibiotic ointment in "single serve" packages to add to <br/>
your first aid kit...<br/>
<br/>
Every letterboxer should bring a small first aid kit with them if they are <br/>
planning a hike of a half hour or more...they are made to fit in your <br/>
pocket...<br/>
<br/>
As a matter of fact, one letterbox I found even had one in it.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing<br/>

&gt;The only thing about using Altoid tins that concerns me is that they are<br/>
&gt;"curiously strong mints" and I think I read somewhere that bears like<br/>
&gt;the taste of mint.  Other critters might, too.  So if they smell the<br/>
&gt;mint might they make off with the container?  Also, is there a rust<br/>
&gt;factor involved in using these containers?  I'm not sure they'd fair<br/>
&gt;well in our Oregon rain (not that we've had much of that for a long,<br/>
&gt;long time, though we're supposed to get some soon).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let me know how they hold up.  They may do just fine and if they do I<br/>
&gt;sure want to know.  Their size would be good for small letterboxes.<br/>
