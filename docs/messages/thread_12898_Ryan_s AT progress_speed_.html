Ah, "Trail Days" in Damascus,VA - I remember them<br/>
well! In fact, I was there for the very first "trail<br/>
days", which was part of the AT's 50th anniversary<br/>
celebration back in 1987! I managed to time it just<br/>
right, starting at Springer Mt, GA on April 27th and<br/>
backpacking all the way there with no shuttles, side<br/>
trips or layover days! (Whew!) Back then there were<br/>
lots of friendly local folks, homemade cookies for<br/>
everyone, and a little parade where I was asked to<br/>
carry the Grandma Gatewood banner, which was kind of<br/>
appropriate since she had hiked the AT 3 times, and I<br/>
was also working on my 3rd AT(and 2nd PCT!)that year!<br/>
<br/>
Well, it seems things have changed quite a bit since<br/>
then! On my last time through a couple of years ago,<br/>
"trail days" had become one HUGE "Tent City", with<br/>
people drifting in from everywhere! Even though it was<br/>
fun to see a few old friends (like Warren Doyle with<br/>
his traditional half gallon of ice cream!), it still<br/>
seemed to be rather a disappointment for most of the<br/>
folks there who weren't into gear, drugs or crowds!<br/>
Personally, I couldn't wait to get back "into the<br/>
woods"- thank you, Bill Bryson, for your good humor!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that reminds me that I should probably still<br/>
toss in my choice for Ryan's Harper's Ferry arrival<br/>
date. I'm going with June 9th, since that was MY<br/>
actual HF arrival date for my first AT, and it's just<br/>
too hard to imagine that someone as young, fit, and<br/>
self-confident as Ryan seems to be is going to be THAT<br/>
much slower than I was back then!! :-) Just about all<br/>
the backpackers I've ever met have been able to get<br/>
well into their strides by the time they reach VA, so<br/>
hiking 20+ mile days through that long and lovely<br/>
state comes relatively easily, especially - as I<br/>
recently told Amanda - in the northern ridgewalk<br/>
portions near Skyline Drive, which are generally<br/>
considered the easiest parts of the whole AT! So, I<br/>
certainly expect that Ryan should be able to pick up<br/>
his pace by then, too! Just hope that in the process<br/>
he can somehow manage to keep that incipient swelling<br/>
of "thru-hikeritis" under control as well!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and happy trail days to all!<br/>
<br/>
