<br/>
Renting a VW Microbus, I headed for the wild wild west. Destination Arizona. Let me tell you, it was hot driving those roads with nothing but cold coffee and turtle soup to sustain me. Speaking of turtles, how about that Green Tortuga? For a self-professed hiker, how is it that the only letterbox he has listed in the great state of Arizona is a driveby? Was his shell too heavy to carry that day?<br/>
<br/>
The hippie mobile and I arrived at the Grand Canyon in time to celebrate the Native American Heritage Days. Lots of sights to see; including Miss Hopi herself. Now there was a sight worth seeing. Two days of spirits and I was set to continue my journey. <br/>
<br/>
No trip to the "copper state" would be complete without a tour of Tombstone. Gambling, drinking, shootouts, what more does a town need? The one thing this town could use is another letterbox. Maybe someone could convince that Green Tortuga to do another driveby.  <br/>
<br/>
Next stop Chloride, the location of the 4th Annual Hot Dog Eating Contest. The name doesn't do much for me but the hot dogs are a culinary delight. But, I did not come here to talk about cold coffee, Miss Hopi or hot dogs; I came here to talk letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing in Arizona is well and thriving. There are about 400 traditional letterboxes, but only 9 mysteries, not nearly enough. And I do love a mystery. Use good containers and keep your snacks away from the hiding area. Remember the untamed areas are home to rattlesnakes, cougars, and coyote; respect and know the environment. Beware especially of that bloody jumping cholla! I have personal experience; don't ask.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
<br/>
Investigator Francis Bacon<br/>

Could someone hook me up to the most visited talk group in Arizona? If they<br/>

I found the Southwesterners and signed up there.  Thanks for those who replied with information.  I'm trying to narrow down my vacation time so as to get more specific with my questions.  <br/>
