Dear boxers:<br/>
<br/>
It seems our own beloved Lady Prisspot has been angered by the <br/>
remarks made by GW Bush in Monday's Presidential interview!<br/>
<br/>
The President has besmirched her Ladyship's honor and she has emailed <br/>
us a message to defend her pristine character, which we have posted, <br/>
in all fairness, to our website.<br/>
<br/>
Stop by as this story continues to unravel . . . .<br/>
