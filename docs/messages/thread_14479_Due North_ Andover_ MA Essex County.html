yesterday, but didn't because of the man in the fire tower. I had no <br/>
idea there was one there, or that it was manned. But I could see him <br/>
looking down on me, watching my every move to make sure I didn't set <br/>
a fire(?) I guess. Anyways, bring someone to distract the man in the <br/>
tower!<br/>
