Thank you so much for trying to get the site back up and running.  I know<br/>
you all volunteer your time and talent and I appreciate it; I am sure you<br/>
had better things to do this weekend<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For my part, I learned a bit about being resourceful when finding clues and<br/>
a gentle reminder about relying on technology.  <br/>

I spent most of the day yesterday loading LbNA on a new <br/>
web hosting service and experimenting with optimizations. <br/>
If we can't get the current hosting service to restore <br/>
service by the end of today, I'll provide a temporary link <br/>
to the new hosting service and start the process of <br/>
pointing letterboxing.org to it.<br/>
<br/>
My apologies to everyone that missed out on some boxing <br/>
this weekend because of the problems.<br/>

Well, Choi does live in New England, so there's a good chance he<br/>
really DIDN'T have something better to do this weekend, snowed in and<br/>
all that. He's probably just lucky he had power to work on the problem. =)<br/>
<br/>
We've been playing around with queries and got one problematic query<br/>
to run about 250 times faster! When LbNA comes back online, it's going<br/>
to be running so fast you're gonna demand it get a speeding ticket. ;o)<br/>
