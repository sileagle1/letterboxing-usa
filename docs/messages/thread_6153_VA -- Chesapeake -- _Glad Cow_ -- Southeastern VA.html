<br/>"Glad Cow" resides in a <b>bucolic</b> section of Chesapeake, VA.
<br/>
<br/>BUCOLIC
<br/>Etymology: Latin bucolicus, from Greek boukolikos, from boukolos cowherd, 
<br/>from bous head of cattle + -kolos (akin to Latin colere to cultivate) 
<br/>—more at COW, WHEEL Date: circa 1609
<br/>1 : of or relating to shepherds or herdsmen : PASTORAL 
<br/>2 : relating to or typical of rural life 
<br/><u>
<br/><b></b></u>"Glad Cow"<u>
<br/>
<br/></u>Find our girl on a road that includes both the words Pleasant &amp; Mount.
<br/>There are many a mile--but it's up to you (smile) to keep up with that count.
<br/>If we told you exactly how many miles, there'd be far too few clues!
<br/>So for now "Zion's St. Thomas' Purple Triangle" will sorrily, have to do.
<br/>
<br/>Now across the road from this holy house, lies "Glad Cow's" new home. 
<br/>She's "utterly" tickled to have "moo"-ved there, no longer feeling so all alone.
<br/>She's tucked away, above the fray, from visitors walking out and then in.
<br/>The old shelter still stands, passed from Titus' hands down to Elsa &amp; Len.
<br/>
<br/>Back in the days amid the cows that grazed it belonged to Grandpa Kemp.
<br/>He used it to cool the milk they had gleaned to exactly the right temp.
<br/>Our precious bovine duchess, though we dare not call her Fergie,
<br/>rests RIGHT in the roof, of this old cooling shed belonging to the family Bergey.
<br/>
<br/>Her home is old, the door is gone but inside there are stickers and stamps, 
<br/>No need to go far once out of your car, there's the shed that belonged to gramps.
<br/>Come sit for a spell...oh the stories they tell of the days of milk &amp; roses.
<br/>See what Milky Way's dream, vats of fresh cream and where "Glad Cow" reposes.<b>
<br/>
<br/></b>
<br/>
<br/><b>NOTE: Please don't read further if you want to find this place from clues.  
<br/>But if you have kids in tow when stamping I think it's important to note 
<br/>what follows--one especially fun event, is time sensitive.
