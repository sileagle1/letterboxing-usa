Favorite toys from the childhood of many of my contemporaries were <br/>
the action figures and animals from the Marx Johnny West and Best of <br/>
the West series.<br/>
<br/>
These 12" figures included our hero, Johnny, Jane his wife...daughter <br/>
Josie (and later Janice)...his boy Elroy (no wait, that was somebody <br/>
else)...his boys Jay and Jamie...bad man Sam Cobra, and noble Native <br/>
Americans Geronimo, Chief Cherokee, and later Fighting Eagle and <br/>
Princess Wildflower. Later came Custer and the Calvary, a couple of <br/>
Sheriffs, and a variety of UK, Canadian and Mexican versions. These <br/>
figures exhibited full articulation and molded on clothes, and came <br/>
with a host of vinyl and poly-plastic accessories. The series ran <br/>
from 1965 to 1975. Somehow my parents neglected to buy these for me <br/>
at the time, but like a good boomer, I am happily acquiring them now.<br/>
<br/>
This series of stamps (five so far) celebrates these figures and <br/>
takes them down off the collector's shelf and puts them back into the <br/>
Western landscape they love. Yee-haw!<br/>
<br/>
Our story begins with our hero, Johnny West, waiting for the arrival <br/>
of his beloved wife, Jane, from the porch of the Circle X Ranch (most <br/>
city folk call the spread the Spring Mountain Ranch, but what do they <br/>
know?) Johnny looks out across his fields and fences and sighs with a <br/>
heavy heart. Jane was expected weeks ago, and there's been no word of <br/>
her since she left Arizona. When he thinks of all the misfortunes <br/>
that could have befallen her: a desperate desert death, thieves and <br/>
banditos, or worse, she might actually have run off with that <br/>
cheating, no good...nah...not my Jane...well those big cowboy tears <br/>
start welling up in his painted on eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Johnny took off behind the main house towards his "thinking place," a <br/>
beautiful secluded point looking over the wash behind the ranch where <br/>
the Spring Mountains tower towards the heavens and a man...even a <br/>
little plastic man, can sort out his feelings and be the kind of fool <br/>
that HAS A LOVER'S GRIT.<br/>
<br/>
He was on the path now, his feelings not entirely accessible, rather <br/>
kind of loopy to be exact. About halfway down the trail, he stopped <br/>
to regard a four-trunked tree on his left right before the junction <br/>
of two paths and a bridge. He stopped and thought, "Y'know, this is <br/>
just one of those things, I'll betcha," said Johnny, "she musta hit a <br/>
snag somewhere's and what's in a snag, anyway? Nuthin." He knew he <br/>
was on the right path with his thinking now.<br/>
<br/>
He turned to go off trail towards his thinking place, oh, some of you <br/>
might say at bearing of about 224 degrees, and marched off into the <br/>
brush 55 paces until he came across that old metal thresher and the <br/>
logs he always meant to do something with, like maybe make himself a <br/>
chainsaw bear and put it on the porch, who can say? <br/>
<br/>
He was close now, just 15 paces from another four-trunked tree at a <br/>
bearing of 160 degrees, where the vista across the Ranch opened up <br/>
like a little kiddies' storybook. Such a bee-yoo-ti-ful sight he <br/>
almost forgot he was supposed to be miserable in missing the missus. <br/>
<br/>
Johnny is waiting for you to join him! Reach inside the base of this <br/>
four-trunked tree after removing a covering stone and another round <br/>
rock. Please rehide as found.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Watch out for critters, the slithering kind of all types abound <br/>
in this desert riparian environment. See, I can read signs. You <br/>
should too. :-) <br/>
Before you set out, please read the waiver of responsibility and <br/>
disclaimer.  <br/>
