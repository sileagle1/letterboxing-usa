Turtle Trail Series<br/>
Dana Peak Park<br/>
Harker Heights, TX<br/>
Bell County<br/>
Placed: 22 Dec 02<br/>
Placed by: Armyswmr99<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Medium<br/>
Time: 45 minutes<br/>
<br/>
Dana Peak Park is located in Harker Heights, TX. To get to the start <br/>
point from I-35, take US 190 West and exit FM 2410 East. (There are <br/>
two exits to FM 2410, take the one in Harker Heights, and not the one <br/>
to Stillhouse Park)  Continue East for 3.5 miles and turn right onto <br/>
Commanche Gap (Follow the sign to "Dana Peak").  Continue 2.5 miles, <br/>
while you pass the "Goats for Sale," and park at the bend in the road <br/>
with the gate leading to a large path. This is the start point.<br/>
<br/>
"Mama Turtle"<br/>
Pass the gate and walk up the hill and then down the hill towards <br/>
Stillhouse Hollow Lake.  You will pass a trail crossing, continue <br/>
straight at 80 degrees, towards the hills across the water.  When you <br/>
are walking on lake-level, you will come to a dead end with a choice <br/>
to go left or right?  Follow the trail at 10 degrees.  The next trail <br/>
marker you see will have a faint painting of a "Turtle T-2" on it, <br/>
follow it straight.  This will lead you around the water.  At the <br/>
next trail marker, go straight.<br/>
<br/>
You will then come to a "Turtle T-2" trail marker, follow path to <br/>
right.  Follow the next two "Turtle T-2" trail markers to the right.  <br/>
The next "Turtle T-2" will lead you to the left up the hill.  Follow <br/>
the trail uphill, it will be a little steep at times.  Follow "Turtle <br/>
T-2" left up 4, then 7 steps.  Continue up the trail.<br/>
<br/>
When the trail peaks, you will see a deer trail up to the actual <br/>
peak, which is topped with large boulders (and a great view).  When <br/>
standing at the base of the deer trail, look at 20 degrees and you <br/>
will see a medium-sized boulder (downhill).  On the downhill (North) <br/>
side of the boulder, look under a small rock pile and you will <br/>
find "Mama Turtle."  Please stamp her in your book so that you can <br/>
reunite her with her baby.<br/>
<br/>
"Baby Turtle"<br/>
After you've stamped "Mama Turtle," head back up to the trail.  <br/>
Continue down the trail in the direction you were heading.  Go down 7 <br/>
steps.  Stand on the 7th step.  At 30 degrees, you will see a dead, <br/>
split tree with a cactus on top.  At the base of the tree is "Baby <br/>
Turtle."  Please stamp him in your book to reunite him with his Mama.<br/>
<br/>
You may either continue down the path or head back the way you came.  <br/>
If you continue, you will head through some woods and then along the <br/>
water and back to where you began.  The trek is a little long, so I <br/>
ride my mountain bike, but it would be a nice afternoon hike also.<br/>
