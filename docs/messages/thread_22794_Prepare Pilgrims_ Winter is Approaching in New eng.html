will turn into frozen vistas, inhospitable to the less fortunate traveler.  <br/>
I will have boxes available at our upcoming event for Project Cover Up.  As <br/>
you ready your offerings for the gathering at hand consider those unprepared <br/>
for bitter bite of winter.  Scour your closets for good coats no longer in <br/>
use or consider the purchase of an extra pair of gloves, hat or scarf from <br/>
the traveling peddlar when he stops in your village.<br/>
<br/>
Redemption is at hand for those who give, as well as those who search.  <br/>
Begin your way on the angelic path now.<br/>
