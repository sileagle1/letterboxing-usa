<div>This box is "missing" 
because Dan and I have it.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>On Sept. 7th we found this 
box completely full of water.  We took it home and dried out the log book 
as best as we can for the Drew clan, and replaced the log, baggies, 
pen, and box.  We meant to deliver it yesterday to the hiding spot but 
couldn't make the multi-mile beach slog in the rain.  Up to that point it 
had only been lightly raining.  We tried to drive down in my Jeep Grand 
Cherokee but we bogged down in 4-low in first speed and got out of there before 
we got in too deep. Good thing!  The skies opened up and we could have been 
in *really* deep trouble!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I will post again when it 
is successfully returned to its home. Jay, I'll try to mail the log but if I 
don't get to it, I'll bring it along to our little gathering, okay?</div>

Thanks for the rescue-boxing, Mary! If the slogging is too boggling, <br/>
I'd be glad to replace it myself. See you soon!<br/>

Jay, who can't understand how people get campers out there even WITH <br/>
4-wheel drive...windsurfer would be the best way to travel.<br/>
