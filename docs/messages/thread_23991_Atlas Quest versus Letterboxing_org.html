I've found so many boxes over the years that I don't always remember the names of them.  If I search on LBNA or AtlasQuest for boxes, it will tell me if I've already found them.  That's the advantage of logging it.  Even if I kept a spreadsheet, I'd have to refer to it when searching clues.  Why not let the systems do that for you since they have the capability?  I like to put my "plants" on both systems as well, because some people may not use one of the websites.  <br/>

funhog, you might use a different email address to get your replys to. I<br/>
will be unlikely to be logging your boxes, because I live on the east<br/>
coast, but I do log on both sites. Then I can search for boxes by<br/>
excluding those that I have already found. Narrows the search<br/>
automatically and is very convenient for me.<br/>
<br/>
You can also select not to  be notified when your boxes are found.<br/>

<br/>
- You have mark the boxes on one site "Ignore" so you know not to <br/>
look for it again. I am already having a problem because I've been <br/>
too lazy to update one of the sites and now I don't know what I've <br/>
found or not on it. <br/>
- If the box is listed on the "other site" and you don't log it on <br/>
that site then you would not be sending a note to the planter. <br/>
<br/>
I guess you could note when a box is only listed on one site and <br/>
send them a note from that. Confused yet? <br/>
<br/>
What I think is that Funhog needs a phone PDA with more features. :-)<br/>

I log both places because not all plants are on both sites.<br/>
I like the set up on AQ but have already found several plants not<br/>
listed there.<br/>

&gt; Welll, but if you do not log on both places you have other problems. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - You have mark the boxes on one site "Ignore" so you know not to <br/>
&gt; look for it again. I am already having a problem because I've been <br/>
&gt; too lazy to update one of the sites and now I don't know what I've <br/>
&gt; found or not on it. <br/>
&gt; - If the box is listed on the "other site" and you don't log it on <br/>
&gt; that site then you would not be sending a note to the planter. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess you could note when a box is only listed on one site and <br/>
&gt; send them a note from that. Confused yet? <br/>

&gt; What I think is that Funhog needs a phone PDA with more features. :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; No, no, no... please don't log them in both places. As the hider of<br/>
&gt; &gt; many letterboxes I find that I frequently get duplicate notices <br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt; finders of my plants. These are automatically generated whenever<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone logs a find on LbNA or AQ. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Since I often retrieve my email with my cell phone when I'm on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; road for business, I frequently find my inbox clogged with <br/>
&gt; duplicates<br/>
&gt; &gt; which I can't delete until I get back home to my desktop computer.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unless you have a reason to keep your records in two places, don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; bother. In fact, there are many folks (like myself) who only keep a<br/>
&gt; &gt; record at home and don't use the logging feature on either site at<br/>
&gt; &gt; all. Funhog<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My question relates to Atlas Quest and Letterboxing.org.  I <br/>
&gt; joined <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Letterboxing.org and I have been logging my finds there.  <br/>
&gt; Should I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; also <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be logging my finds on Atlas Quest? It seems like a lot to log <br/>
&gt; them <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both places.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for your opinions.<br/>
