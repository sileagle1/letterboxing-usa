Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am just sending this message off to most of the groups I am <br/>
involved with.  I am going through a VERY tough time right, <br/>
separating from my partner of five years.  There are four children <br/>
involved, two of my children and two step-children, so its not just <br/>
breaking up a couple, but a whole family. I do not know what the <br/>
future holds for us, there's the possibly of getting back together in <br/>
the future, but I am also a realist and know that may not happen <br/>
also.  We are ALL going to counseling and hope that helps.  However, <br/>
I know that right now, I am the one faced with the difficulties, both <br/>
emotionally and financially of being the one moving out.  One of the <br/>
things I am having a hard time with, is simply keeping up with <br/>
correspondence.  So I am letting everyone know that I wish to stay on <br/>
the group lists, but I am setting my account not to receive any <br/>
emails other than the moderators alert mails.  I will still go to the <br/>
group's site and read the messages when I have time, but that is <br/>
scarce right now and not really my priority for the time being.  <br/>
There are a couple of groups that I will continue to get mail from in <br/>
the daily digest format.  Please do not reply to me through the <br/>
boards message system, as I will not see that reply perhaps for a <br/>
long while.  However, if you wish to email me directly, you can do so <br/>
at LetterBoxer@GypsyPyrates.com. Thank you to everyone that has <br/>
already offered their kind thoughts and words.  It is greatly <br/>
appreciated.  Sincerely, Rasha  aka:  Cap'n Rasha<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to say that I agree. If you're only here for "just the facts", there's some very good books out there as well as the online info. Why stick around here for some little tid bit to fall out in a message when you can save a lot of time doing the research on your own? <br/>
<br/>
Personally, "just the facts" is not the reason I'm here. Yes, I like the sharing of information. Different people have different view points and/or experiences than I have so may come up with solutions that I had never thought about. However, the main reason I'm here is to interact with the PEOPLE...to make friendships with other people that enjoy doing what I enjoy doing. <br/>
<br/>
My most cherished stamps are the EXCHANGES that I have been privileged to have made. While the stamps themselves are the hobby, the creators of those stamps are the true treasures. For example, I just got a stamp 2 weeks ago. It was a beautiful stamp combining 4 different images into one stamp. While it was a wonderful stamp (full color as was inked with colored markers), what makes it truly special is that I got to meet every one of the four family members that it represented. I was fortunate enough to be able to spend a few hours with them and get to know them. <br/>
<br/>
So, I guess while I'm not an avid poster, I have to say that if this is the type of group that enjoys kicking one of its members while they're down and obviously in need of support, I'll probably never be nominated "member of the year" for which I will be truly thankful. <br/>
<br/>
I honestly don't mean for this to be a flame of any sort. I realize that everyone has a different reason for why they are here...it just seemed a very cold and heartless thing to say to someone who is obviously already in enough pain as it is. <br/>
