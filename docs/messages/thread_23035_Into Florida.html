                    <div class="plaintext-content">Was in Florida this past weekend, but no real time for letterboxing. <br/>
I did, of course, bring my 'boxing backpack with me (as I tend to do<br/>
now on all trips -- a sure sign of addiction, don't you think?), and<br/>
picked up two boxes plus a hitchhiker in Lake Worth.  Unfortunate that<br/>
there was no time to hunt any other boxes.<br/>
<br/>
However, that marks the 8th state I've found boxes in, and covers<br/>
three of the four corners of the country now (New England, Southern<br/>
California, and now Florida).  For some, the 8th state was eons ago,<br/>
but for me it's great to be able to hunt and find 'boxes in places<br/>
other than my own backyard (although I greatly appreciate that my<br/>
backyard -- New England -- has thousands of boxes with no chance of me<br/>
running out of boxes to hunt).<br/>
<br/>
Funny as it may be, the hitchhiker I found, The Dawnlander's Hurryin'<br/>
Hoosier, originated from the Northeast.  I had a similar experience in<br/>
California, where all four hitchhikers I found there were also from<br/>
the Northeast (this time from NY).  How is it when I travel a 1000<br/>
miles or more from my area of the country, the hitchers I find are<br/>
from here?  LOL.  Oh well, they are coming home now!<br/>
<br/>
I won't have any chance to do any 'boxing before the next gathering on<br/>
Feb. 4, so for those heading to that one, I'll see ya there!<br/>

There probably aren't as many people who have boxed in multiple states as you think... let alone 8 states...Thanks for the update!  I'm going to Florida in a few weeks and hope to get a box or 2, but visiting friends who are not letterboxers - so we'll see.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks and Enjoy!<br/>
