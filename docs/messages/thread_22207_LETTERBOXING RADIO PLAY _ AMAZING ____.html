<br/>
To listen to a play about LETTERBOXING is however TOTALLY Wierd !!<br/>
<br/>
For the next week (until 8th July) you can listen to the most amazing<br/>
BBC docu-drama about Letterboxing on Dartmoor....It is a streamimng<br/>
soundtrack that runs in Real Player..IT IS FANTASTIC !! <br/>
<br/>
It is just SO English ...and SO letterboxing... I can't imagine it<br/>
will work without broadband...and it is about 45 minutes long ! So it<br/>
takes some concentration ..not to mention concentration span....<br/>
<br/>
It is worth it !<br/>
<br/>
Here's the write up...from the BBC website...<br/>
<br/>
Friday 1 July<br/>
<br/>
Stamp Collecting with Legs<br/>
<br/>
By Alan Francis.<br/>
<br/>
Over 30,000 little Tupperware boxes are buried all over Dartmoor, each<br/>
containing a specially designed printable stamp and ink-pad, the<br/>
locations of the boxes are listed in a large book of clues.<br/>
Enthusiasts scour the moor for them, in a hobby called 'letterboxing'.<br/>
Comic Alan Francis plays a character who, in order to get out of doing<br/>
DIY, has lied to his girlfriend for six months by saying he is<br/>
letterboxing every Sunday, when he is really lazing about with his<br/>
mate Pete. When his lie threatens to be exposed he rushes to the moor<br/>
to try to actually find some stamps to try to get a prized 100 club stamp.<br/>
<br/>
With Alan Francis, Barnaby Power, All other voices ...... Dartmoor<br/>
Letterboxers <br/>
<br/>
The website is <br/>

http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/afternoonplay.shtml<br/>
<br/>
You need to click on the play for July 1st ..."Listen to Friday"<br/>
<br/>
Be prepared !!!  it begins in the middle of the previous BBC radio<br/>
item...some guys talking about cooking French Food....and then the<br/>
play about Letterboxing begins...<br/>
<br/>
The story is a bit odd at the beginning...but gets very very very<br/>
Letterboxing....<br/>
<br/>
It is great !<br/>
<br/>
It is just SO funny...<br/>
<br/>
I had to tell someone ....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just listened to the broadcast and the play was fantastic!  It reminded me so much of my time in Dartmoor last year!  (I too went to the Railway Inn, which was right next door to the Plume of Feathers in Princetown, and was in awe over how many stamps they have!  I think I only have about a half dozen of different images from there!  And no, I didn't count every stamp ;-)  Just one stamp from each pub ;-)  <br/>
One of my most favorite memories was seeing all of the heather and gorse!  OK, now I know what you're saying... GORSE????!!!  But from a distance (and not stuck to it mind you....), the purple of the heather and the green and yellow from the gorse bushes were beautiful!  I also loved all of the crosses on the landscape (check out my pics from Dartmoor on LBNA)!  The tors were magnificent as well!  I can't wait to go back!!!!  <br/>
