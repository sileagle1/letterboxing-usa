<div><span class="691365711-19092002">We 
were getting pretty desperate that we were nearing 100 boxes and still no 
hitch-hiker so we planted another one:</span></div>

<div><a href="http://www.psychokiwi.org/letterboxing/dna.htm">The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything</a> hitch-hiker set out to explore the galaxy on September 
11, 2002<span class="691365711-19092002">  and </span> find happiness.  <span class="691365711-19092002"> </span></div>
<div><span class="691365711-19092002"></span> </div>
<div><span class="691365711-19092002">Then we stumbled across one (what joy!): the Travelling 
Valentine, which was hiding out at the Valentine Mystery Box. It was so well 
camoflagued that at least one set of boxers thought it was the mystery box and 
didn't take it with them! It took us a few minutes to realize what it 
was.</span></div>
<div><span class="691365711-19092002"></span> </div>
<div><span class="691365711-19092002">One more box to go now to get the 100 (great 
excitement!)</span></div>

<div><span class="691365711-19092002">P.S. I've been following the discussion about whether a 
HH should have its own box or not. I've put mine in smallish rubbermaid boxes 
(which is not ideal), but  the Travelling Valentine is a huge box, which 
will make it very difficult to re-hide. Just something to keep in mind when 
designing HH.</span></div></span></body></html>
