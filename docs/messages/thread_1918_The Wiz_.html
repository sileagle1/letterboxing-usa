&gt; and whilst I am musing...I was thinking that a meet of LbNA members <br/>
on the<br/>
&gt; "original" moors might be nice..and given enough time to plan I can <br/>
gain<br/>
&gt; access to a nice big house on Dartmoor with with a dozen bed rooms<br/>
&gt; suitable for a "modest" gathering ..so should you wish to visit .. <br/>
and we<br/>
&gt; can discover enough equally crazy LbNA enthusiasts ...It could be <br/>
arranged<br/>
&gt; that James Perrot's "Cranmere Pool" stamp could be in your book <br/>
too... !<br/>

How about in 2004 for the 150th?  We could get something together by <br/>
then couldn't we?  Or maybe even earlier.  What a great offer Oh <br/>
Wizard!  I'd certainly try my best to be there!<br/>
<br/>
And thanks for your history lesson and random (?) musings.  I do so <br/>
enjoy it when you contribute to our list!<br/>
