In the last few days I had the pleasure of tracking down the letterboxes<br/>
at Alum Rock, <br/>
Uvas Canyon and Santa Clara Mission. The stamp at Alum Rock is very<br/>
special, <br/>
definitely a collector's piece; the hike at Uvas Canyon is very<br/>
beautiful on a winter <br/>
day; and the box at the Mission is a hop, skip and a jump from the San<br/>
Jose airport.<br/>
<br/>
I also found time to check on my letterboxes at Coyote Creek. The first<br/>
box was a <br/>
goner, as was its entire hiding place. The big dang boulder that was its<br/>
home has <br/>
magically disappeared. So, the replacement box is in a new spot. The<br/>
clue has been <br/>
