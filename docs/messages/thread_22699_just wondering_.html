This is one of those make-your-own-call things. Some people count <br/>
several types of boxes/stamp-ins as Finds, some are more specific about <br/>
what they count - some don't even keep track of the numbers.<br/>
<br/>
I'm with you - in a place where I'm about to hit a milestone. If I <br/>
counted hitchhikers, PLBs, personal travellers, or something else, I'd <br/>
be over F-100. However, early on, I decided that my Finds were only <br/>
those boxes/stamps I followed clues to find, so I am maddeningly close <br/>
to 100, but not quite there by my count.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, being this specific (read picky and maybe a bit noodgy, lol) <br/>
means that I have several different counts to keep track of and the <br/>
front of my logbook has a code-key. I like my system, but it'd go over <br/>
like a lead balloon with a lot of folks. :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; . also, is there a way to make sure letterbox seekers, check off<br/>
&gt; online, that they found the box?<br/>
<br/>
Nope. You can encourage it by mentioning it in your clues and/or in the <br/>
logbook, but "make sure"? No. Some will and some won't........<br/>

starting this hobby with similar questions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is no specific rule as to how you must count finds, but the<br/>
general consensus is that everytime you stamp into your logbook, you<br/>
add one to your "F" and or "X" count.  A letterbox you hunt, a<br/>
hitchhiker and personal travelers are all "F"s.  Exchanges with other<br/>
letterboxers (signature stamps) are "X"s.  Hitchhikers should be<br/>
considered in your F count.  They are letterboxes -- they just operate<br/>
a little differently.<br/>
<br/>
Take a read of this article by Silent Doug for more information:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/articles/00000003.php<br/>
<br/>
You won't get an accurate F count on the LbNA list as some boxes (such<br/>
as hitchhikers) you find are not listed there.  The best is to track<br/>
your finds in a spreadsheet.  I posted on on the files section of this<br/>
board if you'd like to use it.<br/>

Hi David,<br/>
Here are a few links that you might find helpful. there are other <br/>
informational links listed on the left hand side of this chatlist <br/>
page or you can go to the bottom of the LBNA home page for a listing <br/>
there.<br/>
There is nothing wrong with asking you questions on this list, but <br/>
some folks have read the same questions many times and may not <br/>
respond. <br/>
