<br/>
I was just notified that my geocaching travel bug, which is a <br/>
letterbox, has been dropped off in northern Virginia Beach.  <br/>
<br/>
Please stop by and make an entry!  If you would like to move it to <br/>
another Geocache, feel free.  Just read the instructions for Travel <br/>
Bugs.  For this type of HH, you are meant to tell people where you <br/>
put it, and it is meant to go to another geocache.<br/>
<br/>
For details see:<br/>

Have fun.<br/>
