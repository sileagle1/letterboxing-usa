Begin your search at University Blvd. and Sligo Parkway.  Park in the first <br/>
parking lot on the right.  Go to the sliding tube. Sitting at the bottom of <br/>
the tube look to the right for the green arches and go there and read the <br/>
instructions.<br/>
<br/>
The number of beginning leg vaults is the number of bridges you must cross.<br/>
The number of beginning balance walks is the number of bridges you must pass.<br/>
Now begin by crossing back over the road and take the trail to the left.<br/>
After the last bridge in the instructions you should come to a bench on your <br/>
right. <br/>
Look behind that bench for a short log, a little ways back into the woods. <br/>
The letterbox is behind that short log.<br/>
