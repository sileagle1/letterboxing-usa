                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Thanks to Churchill and pinecone for the great American Authors <br/>
series. We spent a great Easter afternoon walking with them in the <br/>
woods of Tolland. Just a note 2 boxes need new Ziplocs I would have <br/>
replaced them but I am out. A busy week letterboxing  emptied my <br/>
box.  We had no rouble  finding the boxes and the Cowboy loved the <br/>
brook we were only  a little bit wet  going on to the Rotten Egg <br/>
box.  We enjoyed running in to the entire Cyr clan enroute to <br/>
RottenEggs. The obvious walk in the woods with clue sheet in hand led <br/>
us to recognize the quest.  So we garnered some exchanges, a Penguin <br/>
,and neither of  us were the Rotten Egg , but the stamp there is the <br/>
most clever I've seen to date! Bravo to the Cyr group. And Thanks to <br/>
all the efforts of the Tolland Hikers. Our Easter Afternoon was <br/>
perfect!   Leader of the Pack &amp; Cowboy - in walked off that Easter <br/>
dinner letterboxing<br/>
