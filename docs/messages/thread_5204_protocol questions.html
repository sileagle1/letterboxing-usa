1.  what is the protocol for placing boxes on land<br/>

of my favorite places are owned by quasi-public<br/>
entities such as audubon, etc.   is permission<br/>
necessary (and generally easy to obtain)?  <br/>
<br/>
2.  several of my favorite hikes involve scrambling up<br/>
(and walking near) steep rock.  typically, these hikes<br/>
would not require technical climbing (or "roping up"),<br/>
but they could be a little freaky to someone afraid of<br/>
heights.  should i stay away from these areas with<br/>
letterboxes?<br/>
<br/>
3.  any opinions on placing boxes that may only have a<br/>
seasonal window of accessibility?  for example: a box<br/>
located on a small island in a remote pond, that might<br/>
only be accessible when the pond freezes.  too<br/>
complicated?<br/>
<br/>
any input would be greatly appreciated!<br/>

<br/>
Permission is not always easy to obtain, depends on the entity. Many <br/>
(most) boxes have been secretly placed, and we try to be discreet and <br/>
take our chances.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
No problem, may want to mention that as "difficult" terrain in the <br/>
clue though.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
No problem, but should also mention this in the clue (or if canoes are <br/>
allowed in summer).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; any input would be greatly appreciated!<br/>

think both are acceptable but the clues should clearly<br/>
state these hazards to let any boxers know what they<br/>
are in store for and not waste their time. Others will<br/>
probably enjoy the challange.I'm sure these locations<br/>
would limit the number of hits on the boxes but there<br/>
is not a problem with placing them anyway....Chuck &amp;<br/>
