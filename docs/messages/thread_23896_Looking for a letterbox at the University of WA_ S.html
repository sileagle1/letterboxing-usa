for your troop, rather than taking them to an existing box.  <br/>
<br/>
There are several people who have planted whole series for scouts. <br/>
I'm sure Barefoot Lucy would be happy to give advice.  <br/>
<br/>
If stamp carving intimidates you (it gets easier with practice), I for<br/>
one would send you a hand-carved stamp.  Just contact me off-line.<br/>

Dewberry<br/>
also speaking for Lucy. . .grin. . .<br/>

<br/>
Are you new to letterboxing?  Or just new here on-line?<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering, because if you're already very familiar with <br/>
letterboxing, it's surprising that you aren't searching on the map <br/>
on LBNA or with the search engine at Atlasquest.com.  Or have you, <br/>
and you just can't find one at You-Dub?  [Former Husky here]<br/>
<br/>
If you're brand new to letterboxing, please don't start with a whole <br/>
troop!  Get some experience yourself so you can help them be <br/>
courteous, careful, and discrete.  Some troop leaders have decided <br/>
ahead of time that a whole group searching for a box, especially an <br/>
urban one which requires extra stealth, can be a bit chaotic, and <br/>
diminish the thrill of discovery for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I thought the idea of planting one yourself with your own clues <br/>
would be a good introduction for a group, and not possibly <br/>
compromise an existing box that someone has put a lot of care and <br/>
time into.<br/>
