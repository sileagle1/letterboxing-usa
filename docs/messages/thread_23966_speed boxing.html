For me I think Sat when I found 4. But I was only planning on 2, it turned out each had <br/>
bonus boxes I did not know about when I made my plans. There were 5 total but I found <br/>
only 4.<br/>
<br/>
Personally it takes me a long time to find a box bc I enjoy photography and I spend a lot of <br/>

just depends on where you are boxing how many you can do in a day.  We are<br/>
planning a trip to Hocking Hills State Park in OH where there are close to<br/>
50 if not 50 boxes right there for the finding.  We have planned this a few<br/>
times and something keeps messing it up.  :(   When it finally happens we<br/>
will enjoy the area as we have any other time we have been there (before<br/>
becoming boxers) but will still be able to find a lot more boxes in one day<br/>
than we ever have before.  Not because we will rush and replace them badly<br/>
but because there are that many to be found in one state park.  In my own<br/>
town I couldn't find 50 in a day because there isn't 50 total in the whole<br/>
area and I'd have to drive from one to the next taking up time.  So, "in my<br/>
opinion" how many you find isn't necessarily based on how rushed you are,<br/>
how well you are replacing them, or how much you are taking in your<br/>
surroundings, but based on the amount of time you have and the amount of<br/>
available boxes close together.<br/>
<br/>
I will go back to lurking now.  :)<br/>

I am sure lots of people have found more letterboxes than me in any case, both in one day or <br/>
session as well as in general. (I mean, I don't know that my own answer is particularly <br/>
interesting or enlightening.)  I personally will regret the day that I have finished finding <br/>

The planters have all been in contact as far as I can tell.  One wonderful<br/>

follow so we catch all the great area and find all the great boxes in the<br/>

finds into AQ and LB.org, and like to see my F-count go up.  However, <br/>
I have finally figured out that true "speed boxing" is not for me.  <br/>
During the lead-up to a recent event, I found myself complaining to my <br/>
friend that I wanted to stop and spend some time enjoying the places <br/>
we were visiting, and not just run in - stamp in - run out - drive to <br/>
the next place!  Seriously, I now need to go back to some of these <br/>
spots and spend a few hours, or a day, just enjoying what's there!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I admit it - I'm guilty of hiking for a solid 8 hours collecting <br/>
letterboxes.  Those were several boxes in just a couple of nearby <br/>
places.  But the frantic OH-MY-DOG-HURRY-HURRY-HURRY-BOX-BOX-BOX thing <br/>
got old for me, fast.<br/>
<br/>
To each his own...if you enjoy scurrying around to raise your F-count, <br/>
go for it!  But I might lag behind...ooh, look!  Pretty!  :-D<br/>

I hope that isn't the main reason people start planting. I would <br/>
rather  that people start planting to give back to letterboxing and to <br/>
share special spots and experiences. Otherwise I would just as soon <br/>
have them remain finders.<br/>

Then you'll be glad to hear, I have a special spot picked, up your <br/>
way!  It will probably be a year before it gets up there as I have a <br/>
stamp idea that needs work.  It'll definitely be there before we run <br/>
out of boxes to find.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And I want to make sure I do you proud...  Ooooh, and I just thought of <br/>
another place I'd like to plant, in Don and Gwen country...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's a good point. Perhaps when I have been doing it as long as you I will have a better <br/>
grasp of the whole big picture. I have only planted one box. It might go missing someday. <br/>
The stamp is not that great but I would miss the cute logbook I made using my <br/>
scrapbooking materials. If it ever disappears that is.<br/>

&gt; Actually if we all were a little more conscientious about letterboxing as a big picture, not <br/>
just "my own boxes" perhaps there wouldn't be so many people complaining about <br/>
careless boxers and missing boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my perspecitve -- you have yours, I have mine.<br/>

want to give back to the local people who have given you such wonderful finds -- ie, <br/>
giving back to letterboxing and the letterboxing community -- as well as coming up with <br/>
all these great ideas for showcasing the places that YOU know and love?<br/>
<br/>
So what is the problem with moving on to planting after you get some experience <br/>
finding.... again? What did I miss?<br/>
