I have placed 2 boxes now and working on  3 and 4, have found 3.:-)<br/>
Anyway...when I see my clue on the Whats New link they are still in email<br/>
form surrounded by ads etc.  :-(  The others I pull up are in a cleaner<br/>
format.<br/>
How do I get my clues posted in a neater way?<br/>
Thank you, goattrails<br/>

Be happy that your clues can be found on "What's New". They will eventually get posted to the map.

you will see plenty of comments about getting a free website at Geocities.<br/>
I went there, and within an hour had a web site!  It is very easy to do,<br/>
using the tools that are there.  Go for it!!!<br/>
