I think he's probably refering to the one I hid, but not to worry, I <br/>
don't intend to let people know where it's hidden--just where it's <br/>
been.  I did mention the starting location, though, because I wanted <br/>
it there for a reason.  After that, it'll be a lot more difficult to <br/>
find.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, if somebody wants it, they'll have to race for it.  Only the <br/>
first person wins.  =)<br/>

I thought I'd put my two cents worth in on hitchhikers.  It's O.K. to me<br/>
if I know where a hitchhiker is.  It will give me added incentive to get<br/>
my lazy butt up Mt. Defiance again (which in this part of the country Mt<br/>
Hood is considered a training hike for).  <br/>
<br/>
East Coasters seem to run across hitchhikers every five minutes, but for<br/>
those of us over here in Oregon it is a rare event and a hint doesn't<br/>
hurt me any.  Now it's just getting the time to get out in the Gorge and<br/>
do that steep 11-mile round trip! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Ryan for placing this new series!<br/>

I've been wanting to comment for a few months now about hitchhiker <br/>
locations being revealed. Somewhere way back in the posts I had seen <br/>
a newly planted HH location mentioned more than once. It was Ryan's <br/>
post that prompted me to finally share my thoughts on this, NOT Trish <br/>
Kurdziel's.<br/>
<br/>
Ryan: I think I now understand why you mentioned your hitchhiker's <br/>
location. <br/>
<br/>
Trish: OOOPS! I comletely MISSED your post immediately preceding <br/>
mine. Yes- it looks as if my comments were in direct response to your <br/>
message when I actually hadn't even seen it yet. So, sorry, Trish. I <br/>
agree that your general comment about a hitchhiker "somewhere in RI" <br/>
(among some 100+) boxes seems pretty innocuous to most.<br/>
<br/>
But I STILL think hitchhikers were intended to be an "underground <br/>
community", so to speak, and hopefully many still are.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing sure has come a LONG way from Dartmoor, hasn't it?<br/>

details of every known hitchhiker's movement -- I think, fortunately, <br/>
that this may be defunct now but I dunno.  Possibly a positive<br/>
trend if true ...<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I think there was at one time some intent to<br/>
keep some mystique about what we do, or at least there should<br/>
be, IMHO.  Otherwise we should just log every hunt and every<br/>
hike and every hitchhiker on a big web page like the geocaching <br/>
folks do (I guess if people want that, they could do it here, <br/>
too ... I assume because it was never done, people don't want <br/>
it here).  <br/>
<br/>
I will throw out the opinion, while I'm here, that some of the chit <br/>
chat about hunting boxes lately seems a bit too detailed and <br/>
specific -- but I guess that is for the community to decide.  Just <br/>
don't give away similar details about my boxes please :-)  I think <br/>
there is an art to describing the hunt for those with ears to hear <br/>
to understand what happened, but to not give anything away to the <br/>
clueless.  I do know, at least once, that someone on this list gave <br/>
away fairly specifically the location of someone else's mystery box <br/>
a while back.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing sure has come a LONG way from Dartmoor, hasn't it?<br/>
<br/>
No matter what happens, some mystery still lives in the gaps.  Some <br/>
letterboxing has, some has not ...<br/>
<br/>

You are OHHHH, so right! The chatter has grown, just<br/>
like the size of the Mail-group, to include, I am sure<br/>
inadvertent clues to hidden letterboxes. I am guilty<br/>
of giving a little assistance to someone who needs a<br/>
little nudge in the right direction, but I would never<br/>
say, HEY, a letterbox is hidden right by that tree! <br/>
A prime example of my dedication to this precept would<br/>
be Rays Dilemma.. this box has been plaguing me for<br/>
over a year now, the most help I have ever asked was<br/>
for someone to tell me I was in the right place...<br/>
generally speaking... I am sure that when I do find it<br/>
I will be dissapointed... "what's next?" I guess there<br/>
is always "Quatrains" to find.<br/>
<br/>
Just like I don't want to see a stamp before I find<br/>
the box, I don't want to find the box until I FIND the<br/>
box!<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing to you:<br/>

That's my point. There is absolutely NO need to<br/>

Hi, Tom,<br/>
<br/>
I haven't followed this thread too closely because it seems like much ado<br/>
about nothing, especially the post that said "SHUT UP." How rude. However,<br/>
when I read your last statement I felt compelled to join in. I just wanted<br/>
to add that when I placed my first hiker, I WANTED people to know where it<br/>
was. I wanted someone to go to this out-of-the-way box (that doesn't get a<br/>
lot of traffic, from what I've seen, and the clues are fun) and get my hiker<br/>
on the move. My hiker, my choice. No one made anyone go get it. If that<br/>
killed anyone's idea of mystery and fun or how a hitchhiker *should* be<br/>
done, too bad.  (Oh, yeah, and I'd do so again.)  JMHO and YMMV.  But it is,<br/>
IMOHO, much more fun to keep track of hikers already on the move by tracking<br/>
where they were last picked up, not where they last got off and are waiting.<br/>
It's nice to know _when_ they have been returned to the wild, even if you<br/>
don't want to know where, so that's a very good use of a hiker page.  Some<br/>
of us feel a very personal connection to our creations.<br/>
<br/>
Hope we can all keep letterboxing fun!<br/>

&gt; I don't think simply putting HH in the subject line is a solution. <br/>
<br/>
Not a solution, but it can't hurt if you by into the state abbrev<br/>
business.  For example, I'm aware of people who simply don't want to <br/>
see hitchhiker-related posts, whether found, placed, or abducted by <br/>
space aliens.  This would be a solution for them, even if one doesn't <br/>
like my bulletin board idea, and seems akin to people in HI not wanting <br/>
to read thru clues for boxes in ME (yes, I am a big Get Smart fan ;-)).<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I see no difference between saying "I found HH X" (which gives a <br/>
hint of the location of a letterbox placed by someone else), and "I <br/>
placed HH X" (which gives a hint of the location of a letterbox placed<br/>
by someone else).  If one is poor etiquette, the other seems poor <br/>
etiquette; if one is ok, the other seems ok.<br/>
<br/>
Giving hints to the locations of letterboxes placed by someone else<br/>
is poor etiquette.  (What you say on your own boxes when you put them<br/>
in the wild, hitchhiker or otherwise, is your business, of course).  <br/>
Now, is there an exception to this rule for hitchhikers?  In some <br/>
people's minds, yes, and in other people's minds, no.  My guess is that <br/>
it is running about 50/50.  (I do know that if someone posted hints to <br/>
the locations of boxes I created, HH or otherwise, I would be disappointed).<br/>
<br/>
The point is that people as a community want it both ways.  Some detest<br/>
HH chitchat, and some love it.  There is a great example of this elsewhere, <br/>
and that is the DH rule in baseball, where people as a community want it <br/>
both ways, and consensus will never be reached.  So they have opt-in and <br/>
opt-out.  Generally, with modern media during the baseball season, you <br/>
can watch the form of baseball you prefer if this rule is such a big deal<br/>
to you (and it is a big deal to many, surprisingly enough).<br/>
<br/>
So, as a community, it seems the right thing to do is to come up with<br/>
a way to opt-in and opt-out.  Rights of those who don't want to deal<br/>
with HH chitchat with rights of those who find that HH chitchat is the<br/>
whole point of hitchhikers.  Though not perfect, the bulletin board<br/>
idea does solve the problem.  <br/>
<br/>
Some other possible opt-in/opt-out solutions -<br/>
<br/>
a) someone with about 20 hours spare time and a working knowledge<br/>
of php could create a HH specific web site just like the old one,<br/>
but would allow non-webmasters to update it (sort of like the bulletin<br/>
board, but HH specific).<br/>
<br/>
b) People who place HH boxes should note whether this is a chatty<br/>
or secret HH.  Is it a Penn or Teller HH box :-) It would be proper <br/>
etiquette to honor the request of the creator.<br/>
<br/>
Well, quite a bit of blather, but I felt the need to recast the problem<br/>
as one of opt-in/opt-out, not one of right or wrong.<br/>
<br/>

and where..for tracking purposes. ...so yes, we all agree with your point<br/>
Valerie, and Randy Hall's idea is excellent regarding a bulletin board page<br/>
with threads etc.  But as I saw someone else said, if one chooses not to<br/>
know about the HH's then simply delete from the emails. They usually are<br/>
with HH on the subject line.  Then everyone is happy. I certainly don't want<br/>
to know ahead of time where an HH is going. I also think that as this<br/>
community enlarges people have to be flexible. The integrity of the secrecy<br/>
is not spoiled by these slight postings of knowledge.<br/>

kind of slow starters and just started experiencing hitchhikers in the<br/>
Pacific NW last year.  <br/>
<br/>
What I tend to do if/when I find a hitchhiker, which I feel is a<br/>
privilege and not a hindrance, is when I find one I send a note only to<br/>
the person who created it and let them know how its travels have gone<br/>
with me.  When I place it in a hostel I let them know where I last put<br/>
it.  I might mention to the list that I found a hitchhiker and where it<br/>
was found, but I will not reveal where it plans to go to next.  Only to<br/>
the  one who placed the hitchhiker.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't think this subject is worth getting your undies in a bundle or<br/>
your blood pressure up.  Common courtesy is always a good idea on the<br/>
list, too, I think.  We all have our opinions and are free to state<br/>
them, but let's play nice, O.K., kids?<br/>

I have yet to send a hitchhiker of my own off into the big world though I<br/>
did give one a ride. When I do make a HH , and I feel EVERYONE has a right<br/>
to, I will note in the log book that I would like to be made aware of it's<br/>
travels and hope people will let me know where it has been.  If I didn't<br/>
want to know anything about my HH I would note that in it's logbook and<br/>
expect most people would honor my wishes. I don't see why in the world<br/>
anyone would care to know where a HH is headed which seems the same as<br/>
knowing exactly where a letterbook is without using the clues. Leave that to<br/>
the geo-cachers. (giant BIG grin!!)<br/>

closely so let me get this straight--<br/>
<br/>
Someone is upset because there are more hitch hikers<br/>
than they think there should be? Someone is upset<br/>
because they don't feel hitchhikers are a real part of<br/>
letterboxing?  Are you kidding me???<br/>
<br/>
My goodness!  I remember finding Tom Cooch's Palantir<br/>
and actually jumping up and down on the trail with<br/>
giddy glee at the find.  <br/>
Now, Mainetig knows me and is probably laughing her<br/>
butt off at that image (and you would, too, if you<br/>
knew me) but it's true!<br/>
I was so excited that there was an extra surprise and<br/>
so happy to be able to see where it had been, so happy<br/>
to be able to see what some other area's and<br/>
letterboxer's stamps looked like and excited about<br/>
finding a place to put it.  I can't imagine why anyone<br/>
would think this was a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
I guess there are always those who need to have<br/>
something to complain about- I just never thought<br/>
something that brought so much fun to my life would be<br/>
something that would be so controversial to some.<br/>

it's been a bit of a disapppointment when it goes off on it's journey <br/>
without us knowing where it has been.  We don't mind people telling <br/>
us (only to our own e-mail address) where the HH will be placed, but <br/>
I wouldn't want to see that on the message board. <br/>
<br/>
Also, to the person who wrote that their HH find rate is 60%, I'd <br/>
feel a bit Hitchhikered out, too, with that many found!  But if you <br/>
find a HH in a box, can't you leave it for the next person to find?   <br/>
Maybe the next person would love to find one.<br/>

boxes I placed and adding them as I check up on the older ones.  It <br/>
really does seem to help with the moisture problem.  For a while I <br/>
was putting the freezer bag on the outside, placing the entire box <br/>
inside it, but was finding them tore up every time I would check up <br/>
on them -- probably just the wear and tear of being taken in and out <br/>
of the hiding spot and also critters.  Works much better on the <br/>
inside and as I am checking boxes after winter, find the ones with <br/>
the inner freezer bag have handled the weather much better.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen a few boxes with the little silica gel paks in the inner <br/>
bag with the log book.  These always seem to be dry also.  I've been <br/>
hanging onto these little babies as I buy things that have them (i.e. <br/>
shoes).  Does anyone know of a source to buy these in bulk?<br/>

&gt; I was also toying with the idea of putting my LB(the entire thing) <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; freezer zip-lock bags, the large gallon sized ones...you know the <br/>
self <br/>
&gt; sealing ones. At least in New England it might help to keep <br/>
dampness and <br/>
&gt; such out of the box. Another thought provoking thread!! <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree! Some of my boxes are like that, and it seems to increase <br/>
the chance<br/>
&gt; of survival. I especially like the bags with the zipper on top - <br/>
folk are<br/>
&gt; much more likely to seal the bag properly because it is easy to do. <br/>
The<br/>
&gt; blue-zipper freezer bags are particularly good because they're <br/>
slightly<br/>
&gt; thicker plastic. <br/>

Good morning/Afternoon/Evening everyone!<br/>
<br/>
    Teram Rayvenhaus will be releasing thier first hand carved stamps within the next week. RayvenDad has carved the Hitchhiker Dude and the HitchBiker Dude and they are almost set to be released as soon as they dry on thier mounts.....<br/>
<br/>
    Current plans are to set them out in the Pierce/King County area of Washington State.<br/>
<br/>
    They will be trackable/updateable from our website:   http://www.myndworx.com/Rayvenhaus along with the rest of our boxes and such.  Don't expect much from the site yet, I'm just starting the coding of it.<br/>

Welcome to the list Leigh! <br/>
<br/>
1) You can certainly post about hitchhikers on this list, but there <br/>
is another list "letterbox-travellers" that is specifically geared <br/>
towards hitchhiker questions, comments, reports, etc.  Joining that <br/>
list may be more fruitful if you are trying to "post" about finding <br/>
one.   The other good thing about that group is that Wanda and Pete <br/>
monitor it and condense that information into their Hitch Hiker <br/>
Tracking Page (a sort of web-based log).  The link to Pete's page can <br/>
be found in the "links" section of that group and we'd suggest you <br/>
bookmark it. <br/>
<br/>
2) In earlier years of this list, you would see many box reports <br/>
(aka "sitreps" of boxes found) on this big list. The list has no <br/>
grown to more than 2200 members and it seems that box reports have <br/>
almost been shunned on this list. It's still fair game and is likely <br/>
a good idea if you have a neat or fun story to share with everyone. <br/>
You may, however, wish to join a regional talk list to post box <br/>
reports. Many 'boxers seem to spend a little more time reading [in <br/>
depth] the regional list for their particular area [ i.e. LBNE = <br/>
Letterboxing New England].  <br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to continue these questions -- they are all good <br/>
questions and you're definately not the first to inquire!<br/>

&gt; I am new to this but can someone please explain to me how to post a <br/>
&gt; hitchhiker?  I am not sure where or how to post.  As far as regular <br/>
&gt; boxes where do I post them?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>

She was started on 9-11-2002 and on 9-11-2003 and 9-11-2004 we <br/>
received the HHer back and posted the comments that were written in <br/>
her logbook. She had a bit of a spell around 9-11-2005 and she wasn't <br/>
returned so the comments weren't posted this last year. This is the <br/>
only HHer of this type that I'm aware of, so many folks are a little <br/>
reluctant to post her current location even though that info is <br/>
clearly posted on her container, logbook and several info sheets <br/>
within the letterbox. Posting the location makes for an interesting <br/>
and different type of letterbox.<br/>

I would have thought so too. If anyone is heading out that way and wants to<br/>
pick it up but cant figure out the clues, give me a shout. Im not an ogre<br/>
and would be willing to help with it in order to get Honor Liberty moving<br/>
again.<br/>

She was started on 9-11-2002 and on 9-11-2003 and 9-11-2004 we<br/>
received the HHer back and posted the comments that were written in<br/>
her logbook. She had a bit of a spell around 9-11-2005 and she wasn't<br/>
returned so the comments weren't posted this last year. This is the<br/>
only HHer of this type that I'm aware of, so many folks are a little<br/>
reluctant to post her current location even though that info is<br/>
clearly posted on her container, logbook and several info sheets<br/>
within the letterbox. Posting the location makes for an interesting<br/>

Only those that find this HHer will have the embarrassment explained. <br/>
Now if you would like to do some research then you can figure it out <br/>
by checking the date of its release on the HHer list, and then <br/>
checking the archives of this list around that date.<br/>

<br/>
It does seem that often the last placer has not<br/>
correctly stamped in, so it takes even more time than<br/>
usual to make sure the box's stamp is included before<br/>
moving it on.  And you have to be with patient people<br/>
when you're leaving one, too, because of the extra<br/>
time.  [Noxers want to get MOVING!]<br/>
<br/>
Just like traditional boxes, I've seen some very<br/>
clever HHs, and some others that seem pretty slapdash.<br/>

&lt;&lt; <snip> And one more point, I think that there are just too many and<br/>
they are loosing their "specialness" <snip><br/>
<br/>
What do you think?  <snip><br/>

<br/>
Yep, I vote for that one.  Definitely just too many of 'em.<br/>
<br/>
But, in perusing the choices at your blog, you don't have that option.  I<br/>
don't wish they'd go away completely.  When I first began letterboxing and<br/>
they were much more rare, it was fun to find them.  I just wish there were<br/>
far less of them out there.  Every boxer in captivity seems to be releasing<br/>
hitchhikers nowadays.  Except me.  I've never released one.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe they're hooking up with fellow stamps in an amorous way and<br/>
multiplying all by themselves.  If the Cylons can evolve, why not HHs?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have never released a HH.  But this week, one of my students is leaving CT and moving to OH.  I learned when we were preparing for a field trip recently that she is a letterboxer, so I told her I'd create a HH for her to plant the first time she goes letterboxing in OH.  Any advice for what should be included with it?  Sometimes when I've found HHs that I've ended up bringing home with me til the next trip (or that were so large it took several trips to find a box to accept them!), I've printed up the HH protocol to leave with them when I planted them again.  I've definitely seen the confusion where it looks like people have been stamping in to the HH instead of the main log!  So right now I'm planning to send the stamp, logbook &amp; HH protocol info sheet, probably in a clearly labeled freezer bag.  Am I forgetting anything??<br/>

I launch one hitchhiker a year, beginning in 2004, so 6 total.  The first<br/>
was found once, then placed in a box that was muggled before anyone else<br/>
found it.  As far as I know the other 5 are still out &amp; about.  They all<br/>
have a common theme (Mr. Suave, Beat Generation, Beatnik, Bongo Player and<br/>
Cool Beat).  I rarely hear about them, but once in a blue moon someone does<br/>
email me.  One that I launched in CA made its way fairly quickly to the east<br/>
coast.<br/>
