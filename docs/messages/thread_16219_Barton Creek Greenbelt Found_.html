Saturday and couldn't find it.  Of course, we ended up starting at the <br/>
wrong trailhead and hiked about 10 miles!  But, it was fun anyway.<br/>
<br/>
So, today, we tried again, starting from the correct trailhead, and <br/>
found it just as the directions stated!  We stamped in and left with <br/>
our books containing their first stamps.  Both our 6-year-old and our <br/>
4-year-old loved it and the weather was great.<br/>
<br/>
The only note about the box, is that the logbook is basically full.  We <br/>
were stamping the backs of pages today.  It may need to be replaced <br/>
soon.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to more finds in the coming weeks!<br/>
