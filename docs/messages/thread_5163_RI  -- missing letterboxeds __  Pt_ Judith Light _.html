missing?  (maybe they were washed out to sea?)  I was out there today <br/>

scattered pile of small rocks where you expect the letterbox to be. <br/>

Also, there was a note at the Black Pt box that the Salty Brine and <br/>
Jerusalem boxes are missing.  Does anyone know the status of these 2 <br/>
boxes?<br/>
