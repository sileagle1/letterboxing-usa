In keeping with our motto, 'keep them moving', we just had to send <br/>
congratulations to Butterfly and Angel on the speediest hitcher <br/>
transplant yet!  Seems they found the Celtic Minature HH on May 16 at <br/>
Gorge Cascade and dropped it off just minutes  later up the trail at <br/>
the Cascades!  Special commendation to Bill Haalck for his same day <br/>
(Feb 19) find and transplant of that same hitcher.  Way to go guys!  <br/>
With the relatively few hitchers we've had the pleasure of finding <br/>
lately (still less than 4% of our total) it does our hearts good to <br/>
see such active sharing and to know that the poor things aren't being <br/>
tossed or forgotten in some cold obscure corner.  I've been worried <br/>
about some of them that we haven't heard from in months, like Ghoti or <br/>
the Walkabout, or in some cases even over a year, like Firebolt or the <br/>
Exeter Vampire, even though we know that they have been picked up from <br/>
where we left them off.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as one of the several people inquiring recently about our <br/>
hitcher web page so nicely put it - it's like these hitcher that have <br/>
passed through our lives have now come in a way to belong to all of <br/>
us, and not just to their originators anymore.  Only one person has <br/>
requested that their hitchers be omitted from the list, but if anyone <br/>
else wants "theirs" removed let us know.  Otherwise our hitcher web <br/>
page is still accessible to all those who belong to the travellers <br/>
group via the Bookmark Option.  Anyone else who enjoys following <br/>
hitchers just send us personal e-mail, and we will be glad to give you <br/>
the address.  Updates and corrections are always appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete<br/>
<br/>
PS:  Also want to report that Phoenix and Seal With A Kiss were found <br/>
not too long ago at our boxes by a new person whose only comment was <br/>
"No Pen", but who will hopefully know what to do with the hitchers.  <br/>
And, for those who haven't heard, FlutterBy flitted off from the CT <br/>
Gathering with Moonstone_Baby.  Happy journeys to all!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">HI Wanda and Pete<br/>
Thanks for the congratulations you sent to Us about quickly moving the<br/>
HH Celtic Miniature ,  I must admit that I wanted to keep it to digest<br/>
the lovely things that others had written, but it is so tiny and my back<br/>
back it so very messy, that I feared it would be quickly lost.!! And at<br/>
my age I sometimes have a 'senior moment' and feared I might forget the<br/>
dear little thing. !!  Hitch hikers are great fun and I try to always<br/>
report on them in this way and did not know there was another 'page' out<br/>
there. Please would you send me the address ? And if anyone is still<br/>
reading this, where oh where is my one and only H.H. 'Surprise It's Me '<br/>
?? I last heard that it was in Ma. somewhere.<br/>
Have fun everyone and butterfly wishes to you all.<br/>
Butterfly aka Nancy<br/>
