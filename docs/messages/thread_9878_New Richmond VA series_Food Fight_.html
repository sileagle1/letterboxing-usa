Box series name: Food Fight! (Deep Run Park)<br/>
Number of Boxes: 3<br/>
Difficulty: easy1 to 1  miles on paved trails<br/>
Date placed: Christmas Day 2002<br/>
State: VA<br/>
County: Henrico<br/>
Nearest town: Richmond<br/>
COMPASS NEEDED<br/>
<br/>
This is a very popular and well-traveled park with many picnic tables and activity areas, so be discreet when stamping in these boxes. <br/>
<br/>
To get to Deep Run Park from downtown Richmond, take I-64 west to Exit 180, Gaskins Road South. Continue one mile down Gaskins to Ridgefield Parkway (stoplight) and turn right. Take the next right into Deep Run Park and park in this first parking area.<br/>
<br/>
Food Fight Box #1<br/>
1.	Take the trail marked Shelter 3, restrooms and go straight down this trail.<br/>
2.	At the restrooms crossroads right past the picnic table on your left, look to your left down toward the playground and lake. Go down that way.<br/>
3.	Take a right at the lake and cross over the wooden bridge.<br/>
4.	Go down the steps to the gazebo and cross over the other wooden bridge.<br/>
5.	As you step off the bridge, go immediately to your right around the bridge railing and look under the bridge. Behind the large rocks under this bridge is Food Fight! #1.<br/>
<br/>
Food Fight Box #2<br/>
      1.   When you return to the path after being under the bridge for Box #1, go left on the paved path.<br/>
2.	At the T-intersection, cross over a third wooden bridge. Coming up on your right will be a large nature pavilion and gazebo with lots of decking. Turn right on the paved path as if you were going to the pavilion, but stay on the paved path.<br/>
3.	A few paces past the pavilion entrance, you will see a small wooden sign that says compass course. Staying on the paved path, walk 25 paces. See that pine-needle-covered path on the right? Take it.<br/>
4.	At the T-intersection, which is 13 paces past the large double-trunked pine tree, take a compass reading. Take the path that goes off at 60 degrees.<br/>
5.	At 88 paces down this path, before you cross the little stream, look directly to your right. You should see three large pine trees 23 paces away. Go to the bases of these trees. Under a smaller fallen pine is Food Fight! #2.<br/>
<br/>
Food Fight Box #3<br/>
1.	Go back to the pine-needle path and continue in the direction you had been going (toward the stream, that is). Follow the trail as it winds to the left. You will not have to cross the stream.<br/>
2.	 Cross over the fallen logs on the path.<br/>
3.	You will soon come to the paved path again. Go right on the paved path, passing a second parking area and picnic facilities on your left. Continue on this main path as it goes uphill.<br/>
4.	Go right at the intersection at the top of the hill and walk for a good while.<br/>
5.	 At the T-intersection, go left.<br/>
6.	A short distance past this last intersection, you will see a tree marked with a wooden sign that says yellow poplar.<br/>
7.	With your rear end on this sign, take a compass reading directly north. Crossing the path and going into the woods on the other side for 17 paces, you will see a small tree that has a large, strangely-shaped base that forms a big hole. #3 is in this hole, buried under a lot of leaves.<br/>
<br/>
To return to your parking area: Continue on the same path, crossing a vehicular road (be careful if you have little ones.) Go straight on this main path (dont take any side paths) until you reach another vehicular road crossing. Your parking area is up and to the right, across the road.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Very cute series with "yummy" stamps.  The incredible weather had <br/>
Deep Run crawling with people, but we managed to stamp in at each box <br/>
without being too conspicuous.  Great job, Boxitup, finding good <br/>
hiding spots in this very busy suburban park.  We had fun "boxin'" in <br/>
our backyard.  Thanks!<br/>
