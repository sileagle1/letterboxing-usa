It might be a little messier since you're more likely to get ink on <br/>

very well in the center of the stamp.  I've even gone so far to foil <br/>

their five attempts didn't work out well at all.  So that's how.  <br/>

So here is the issue I am having  the stamp I just carved is about <br/>
3.5 inches wide and 1 inch thick.  When trying to stamp it myself I <br/>
am already having the problem of the stamp not imaging well in the <br/>
middle.  I carved another that is about 2 inches high and 1.5 inches <br/>

<br/>
I'm confused as to how a stamp that is mounted as a commercial stamp won't ink up in the center?  Every stamp that I have made and mounted, and I'll admit, the number of those is FAR less than most of the people here have done, worked wonderful when mounted on a thin block of wood.  The ones that I place in a letterbox are mounted on thin pieces of wood to combat just what you are remarking about, the inability of the center to get the same amount of pressure applied when stamping as the outer edges do.<br/>
<br/>
All in all though, if the stamp is inked properly and pressed evenly and firmly to the paper, then alls well.  Personally, I've given up on ink pads and have gone with watercolor pens to make my images from. I find much better control in covering the stamp this way and less leftover mess to soil the inside of the letterbox/Ziploc baggie with.<br/>
<br/>
But, like I said, these are MY preferences and are not meant to indicate in any way that anyone else is or was, doing anything wrong or improper.<br/>

<br/>
For a stamp as big as the one you have made, I would back it, but again, that's just me... With the Goop that we use, it's a strong and waterproof adhesive and with the larger stamps, if you let it sit overnight with a heavy book on it, there is no slippage, or "bowing" of the middle... to be truthful, you can do this with ANY size stamp so that there is no issue with the middle not stamping correctly... To me, having a back to the stamp gives it more of an even pressure when stamping the image and doesn't allow the carving material to bend as it is likely to do when not using a backing, be it the pink OR the white stuff....<br/>
<br/>
But again, just my not so humble opinion and 2 cents worth.... *grins*<br/>

&gt; stamp won't ink up in the center?  <br/>
<br/>
Just like a stamp with a backing is hard to stamp because of the <br/>
inability of the center to get the same amount of pressure as the <br/>
outer edges, for a large ink pad, it can be just as diffiult just to <br/>
get the ink on the stamp in the first place!<br/>
<br/>
Although that's not really my grip about mounts.  I use small ink <br/>
pads or markers which eliminate that problem for me, although I know <br/>
others still use large ink pads (a common newbie mistake--I did the <br/>
same thing until I saw the light) where it can be a problem--<br/>
especially for large stamps.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The ones that I place in a letterbox are mounted on thin pieces of<br/>
&gt; wood to combat just what you are remarking about, the inability of<br/>
&gt; the center to get the same amount of pressure applied when stamping<br/>
&gt; as the outer edges do.<br/>
<br/>
Thin, flexible mountings might work, but I've never tried that before <br/>
(nor even seen it used) so I can't claim an opinion on that without <br/>
trying it first.  But if it works, that's great.  As I said before, <br/>
though, I've also found a workaround for the inflexible mountings--<br/>
turning the stamp over and stamping the paper to the stamp rather <br/>
than the stamp to paper.  It works, although it tends to be messier.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sometimes the issue with inadequate ink coverage is a matter of the ink pad and not the stamp.  Often an ink pad will get a depression in the middle from use and you have to make sure you are thoroughly inking each part of the stamp surface. Setting the paper on the stamp rather than stamping on the paper is one way to get a good impression most every time.  It is especially useful with the larger stamps.<br/>
