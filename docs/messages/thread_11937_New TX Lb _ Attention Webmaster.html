Copper Breaks State Park is located off Texas Highway 6, south of <br/>
Quanah, Texas.  It is a small but beautiful park with day and <br/>
overnight camping sites and a very interesting exhibit building which <br/>
details early settlers and Indians in the area.  There is a small <br/>
lake that has a swimming hole and a well-stocked fishing area.  There <br/>
are hiking trails, mountain bike trails and, if you happened to <br/>
remember your horse, equestrian trails!  Hopefully you will have time <br/>
to enjoy a little of this beautiful area when you are box hunting!<br/>
