                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's an update on the boxes we've gotten within the past week or <br/>
so:<br/>
<br/>
Christmas around the World Series (Chaplin): 1. Mexico - the Legend <br/>
of the Poinsettia - contents of box were very wet and many of the <br/>
images in the logbook had been washed out; 2. Sweden - St. Lucia <br/>
Day - contents a little damp; (Drops started falling and we didn't <br/>
get to finish the series yet.)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Birthday (Mansfield) - Good condition - great location!  Be <br/>
careful with small children on the hill.<br/>
<br/>
Goodnight, Moon (Mansfield) - Unable to locate.  Placer warns of a <br/>
snake that had been in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Lions Club Park Soccer Fields (Mansfield) - Good condition.<br/>
<br/>
Eagle Eyes (Marlborough)- Good condition.<br/>
<br/>
DEP Salmon River State Forest (Marlborough) - Stamp pad is missing <br/>
its lid and the ink sponge has separated from the base - messy!  I <br/>
emailed the DEP, so maybe it'll be repaired.<br/>
<br/>
Covered Bridge (East Hampton) - Stamp and ink pad are missing but <br/>
lots of people have been there!  (Placer knows about missing <br/>
stamp.)  We did not get Verdi because little legs can only go so far!<br/>
<br/>
In Search of the Curse of Tutankhamun (Plainfield) - I WAS FIRST!!  <br/>
Woo-hoo!  And I was rewarded with the Dirty Bird Hitchhiker!  <br/>
Contents in great condition - awesome stamp!  (Chuck, I loved the <br/>
curse you included!  Great idea!)  Lots of blueberry and <br/>
blackberries ripening along the trail - yum.<br/>
