                    <div class="plaintext-content">I carry paper towels and large/small ziplock bags in my letterboxing <br/>
satchel.  If a box is saturated, I shake it out, turn it upside-down, <br/>
then proced to do the stamping thing if possible. Then I totally dry <br/>
out the box, rewrap/rebag stamp, wrap logbook in a paper towel if <br/>
merely a tad damp and not damaged.  If totally emersed in H2O, (only <br/>
happened a couple times) I take the logbook, leave some paper for <br/>
people to stamp in on and contact placer, mailing back logbook once <br/>
it has dried out.  We have discussed rehiding boxes even more <br/>
carefully  than you found them (in same spot of course). I feel like <br/>
a caretaker to any box which I have found and try to leave it neat, <br/>
clean, with double-bagged logbook. After all the creativity and <br/>
effort involved in placing those multitude of boxes it is the least I <br/>
can do, and would hope others would help me out similarly with my <br/>
paltry number of placed boxes. <br/>
