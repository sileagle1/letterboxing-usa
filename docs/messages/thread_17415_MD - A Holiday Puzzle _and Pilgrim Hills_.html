<br/>
D and Shoo (and other local boxers, esp. WimpyGirls), we went <br/>
on to Pilgrim Hills the next day. We found the first box without <br/>
problem (the box is cracked but well bagged inside), but the <br/>
previous boxer noted that box 2 was MIA. We were also unable to <br/>
find it. However, in its location we found a geocache. We haven't <br/>
done geocaching, so it was fun to see a box. And Puppy Boy and <br/>
Barbie Girl had fun digging in the sand and running through the <br/>
creek and otherwise getting wet and filthy. <br/>

&gt; We had a lovely time hiking and finding A Holiday Puzzle on <br/>
Sunday.  It <br/>
&gt; hasn't had too many visitors, which is a shame because the <br/>
hike was just right for <br/>
&gt; a winter walk, and the stamps were terrific!  We noticed that <br/>
Knitwit Mom and <br/>
&gt; Puppy Boy had been there earlier in the day.  As we were <br/>
looking for the last <br/>
&gt; box, checking out every downed tree to see if it had fungi and <br/>
twists, someone <br/>
&gt; called out to us, "If you're looking for what I think you're looking <br/>
for, <br/>
&gt; it's farther down the trail."  We asked if by any chance she was <br/>
a nitwit?  (Boy, <br/>
&gt; it would have been rude if she weren't!)  It was Knitwit Mom and <br/>
Puppy Boy!  <br/>
&gt; We had fun exchanging stamps and holiday greetings.  Happy <br/>
New Year to all!  D <br/>
&gt; and Shoo<br/>
