                    <div class="plaintext-content">Because of the disappointment I feel towards this group, I find <br/>
myself compelled to chime in and speak my mind.<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to letterboxing having only discovered it's existence about <br/>
three months ago. Like many of you on this list, I became intrigued <br/>
by the concept and thus began my search for more information on the <br/>
hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Being a member of many Yahoo groups, it was natural for me to go to <br/>
groups home, find one, and join.<br/>
<br/>
I've read every posted message since I first subscribed, eagerly <br/>
soaking up the wisdom, knowledge, and experience of others on the <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
But then things started to change.<br/>
<br/>
Topics being discussed moved farther and farther away from <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Bickering seemed to become a norm rather than an exception.<br/>
<br/>
Words and phrases were being used by their authors to not only <br/>
inflict pain on others but to seemingly twist the proverbial knife.<br/>
<br/>
Discussions of religion and people proclaiming belief or disbelief of <br/>
a higher power.<br/>
<br/>
Naked letter boxing and the sophomoric innuendoes that followed.<br/>
<br/>
The challenging of group moderators and list rules.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of group moderators enforcing the rules off list, they post <br/>
for all to see and then respond. Creating what we all have witnessed.<br/>
<br/>
And one of my pet peeves, the use of the list to send short little, <br/>
often one word comments, that serve only to clutter the <br/>
inboxephemeraes of the group members.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, being a "newbie" on this list and to this hobby, I am greatly <br/>
put off by the ephemera a few of you seem compelled to subject the <br/>
over 2500 members on this list to.<br/>
<br/>
If I were to judge the many people who enjoy this hobby by what is <br/>
found in the posts of late, I would never want to be a part letter <br/>
boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Because I know there are many more people out there who don't act as <br/>
the few, I can still keep an open mind. But what about those that <br/>
won't?<br/>
<br/>
Of all the groups I am a member of, this has to be the most "un-<br/>
professional" of them all.<br/>
I hate to say it but if the few of you who post regularly are <br/>
examples of the many in this hobby, mine will be one face you will <br/>
never see on a hunt.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please, I ask all of you to remember that this is a family hobby and <br/>
to keep this in mind when composing letters.<br/>
Remember that there are rules to this list, and that they should be <br/>
enforced by the group moderators ONLY. They created the group, they <br/>
can make it anything they want.<br/>
